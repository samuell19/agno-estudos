[crickets chirping] [boys whooping] Ah. Down. Down. Come on. Take-- take off his shoes. Come on. MATTHEW: No! [matthew crying] [shouting] [music playing] [laughing] [slow motion yell] [music playing] [slow motion yell] [yell] [slow motion yell] [heavy breathing] [slow motion yell] [grunt] [heavy breathing] [slow motion yelling] [matthew groans] [heavy breathing] [yell] [music intensifies] [high pitched scream] [music stops] [heartbeats] [crickets chirping] Whoo! The shoes! [slow music] [birds chirping] [music intensifies] [bird calling] [matthew making low groans] [religious tune] SONG: --from our birth, over and around us lies. Lord of all to thee we raise this our sacrifice of grace. [church bells ringing] The Bible says that Matthew Shepard was abominable in the eyes of God and worthy of death. It is an abomination! God sell your life! WOMAN: Thank you. JUDY: Thank you for coming. - I could go out there. No, no. Thanks. You can't do that, Dennis. Thank you. - It's his funeral. - I know. I know. Mr. Shepard. Romaine. Oh, Romaine. Thanks for coming. Judy, I'm so sorry. I know. I know. PROTESTER: --was abominable in the eyes of God! PROTESTER: Go home! RELIGIOUS TUNE: Lord of beauty of the Earth. Lord of beauty of the skies. Lord of love is from our birth over and around us now. Lord above-- [gentle music playing] [computer dings] COMPUTER: You've got mail. [sighs] [dog barking] REPORTER: That guy. This is the guy here. Excuse me, Mr. Shepard-- - Yeah, this is our guy. - Over here. Hey, Judy, over here. JUDY: Hi. REPORTER: Dennis, just one quick question. Hey, honey. JUDY: Hey. Dennis, can we a picture of you and Judy? Just one picture. Hey, stranger. Welcome home. What are they doing here? Oh, believe me, they weren't invited. REPORTER: Dennis, will you be asking for the death penalty for McKinney? - How was your flight? REPORTER: Just a few comments, Mr. and Mrs. Shepard? I'm still not as good at this as you are. REPORTER: Judy, Dennis, will you still be seeking the death penalty? REPORTER: Dennis, can you give us a smile? REPORTER: Dennis, over here. - Don't glare. REPORTER: Judy, Dennis, I'd love a shot of you two together. It'll look like a mug shot when it's printed. Jeez, has it been like this for you all year? Oh, no. Only when you want some privacy. The defense has trotted out a lot of wild theories about why Aaron McKinney killed Matthew Shepard. First, it was gay panic. As if Matthew Shepard, all five foot, two inches, and 105 pounds of him struck such terror into Aaron McKinney and his friend that they had to kill him. Then, when that was thrown out by the court, all of a sudden, it was robbery. Well, what is it? Is it gay panic or robbery? It can't be both. Now, they're begging for your sympathy. Poor Aaron McKinney, not that bright, unhappy, dabbling in drugs and alcohol. That man lured Matthew Shepard to the middle of nowhere, tied him to a fence, then beat him senseless with the butt of a foot-long pistol. And now, he has the gall to ask for your sympathy? It makes me tired. Foreman of the jury, have you reached a verdict? FOREMAN: Yes, your honor we have. We find the defendant, Aaron McKinney, guilty of felony murder. [sighs] [lonesome music] JUDY: Yes, we were successful in achieving the verdict for which we fought for so long. However, the guilty verdict is only the first step. As long as people believe it's OK to hate, these crimes are going to keep on happening. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. You OK? It's just hard to look at. Oh, you get used to after a while. Gets easier. Why don't you sit down? You go out there? Where? Oh, God no. What's the point of that? See what they did to him. I'm sorry, Dennis. I was in that courtroom. I know what they did to him. And I don't have to go to any stupid fence to see it. CAL: Emotional day, huh? Yep. Can't be easy being separated as long as you guys have been. You must be looking forward to spending some time together. - It's-- - Well, frank-- You know that isn't really-- it's not quite working out that way. Yeah, I get so many requests to speak about Matthew, and-- The company won't let me stay long. I'm supervising three crews out in Saudi Arabia. And Logan. How's he doing with all this? Oh, he's much better. He's in college now. It takes his mind off his brother. Good. I guess we should get down to business. You remember when we talked about a statement, where one of you gets up there, tells the jury about Matthew? Well, this is the time to really focus on it. Have you kept any of Matthew's things? Oh, everything. Why? Well, you guys should take the weekend, look through those things, pull your thoughts together. See if you could be ready for when they get back on Monday. Your words will guide them to the right decision. Just promise me we're going to get the death penalty this time. I believe we will. This isn't the Henderson trial, Dennis. It was never proven that he took part in the beating. With McKinney, we've got a confession. Hell, he even bragged about it. That's death penalty material. He won't be able to make a plea bargain. OK. Just tell us what to say. Death penalty is an emotional thing. You've got to help the jury get to know your son. Who he was. How much you loved him. How much it hurts knowing he's gone and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Oh. CAL: I know this is hard. I'm just so tired. That's a lot to say in a statement. Well, it doesn't have to be perfect. It's our child's life. Dennis. Will you be careful? I got all that stuff in order. What kind of order? Looks like it's all just thrown in. No. It's all sorted out. That's his childhood stuff. That's stuff from boarding school. And that's stuff in Denver. Wow. It took me ages to figure it all out. - Uh huh. - Just don't mess it up. OK? OK. [sad music] Look at this. And I thought this was long gone. [sad music increases] I know her. She'll understand. Trust me, no girl understands when a guy cancels a formal date at the last minute. Will you-- just hold still. I want to watch the game with dad here. Don't forget about your shoes, Matty. You can tell a man's pride by the way he shines his shoes. That one comes straight down from your grandfather. Oh, I hate this. She's gonna love you. [doorbell rings] Ah, here's corsage. Now give me back my lucky hat. Don't think you're sneaking-- - Get going. - --Of here with that. - You'll get it back. - Hat. - Oh, god. Yeah. Three pins. MATTHEW: I know. JUDY: Breathe. Aaron McKinney. Wouldn't you like to have 10 minutes with that bastard? Sitting there so smug in that courtroom like nothing could touch him. Just give me 10 minutes. [somber music] [sighs] Matthew was always considerate, always willing to share. He believed that there was nothing better in the world than a new friend, and judging someone was a waste of an opportunity. God, this sucks. Well, you were doing good. Judy? You didn't hear what they said about him. JUDY (VOICEOVER): Part of me thinks I always knew Matthew was gay. Maybe that's hindsight. But I am sure things changed in high school. Life got harder for him. Oh, hold on. It's busted. It only opens from the outside. I'll get it. Coming! Sorry. I mean, I promised you would fix it. [slow music] Oh, God. I can't believe I just did that. - No, it-- it's OK. - No, I'm sorry. I-- I'll see you tomorrow. No, no. I just-- I just-- I--I wasn't-- I wasn't ready. You weren't ready? No, I-- I mean I-- I thought you would say something. I mean, if you would have warned me, I could have-- Hmm. Oh, thank you. [doorbell rings twice] JUDY: Oh. Thank you. I guess we'd better get that. Why don't you stay? [doorbell rings twice] - Hi. - Cal. - Sorry, I know it's late. - What's wrong? Come in. - We need to talk. The defense wants to talk about a sentencing agreement. A sort of a plea bargain. What'd you tell them? I told them to get the hell out of my office. The time to work out a plea is before the verdict, not after. That's when they said they wanted to talk to you. They're asking us for mercy? What the hell do they think we're going to say? Did he show mercy when he beat my kid to death? I'm not telling you what to do. I just want it to be your choice. Are you sure we can get the death penalty? No doubt in my mind. They know it, and we do, too. That's why they're begging now. Kid's afraid to die. Tell them no. Tell them I'm glad McKinney's afraid to die. I hope he's scared to death. [crickets chirping] [sighs] [mournful music] [gunshots] Check that out. [matthew laughs] Ta-da! Nice. Nice. Ah, not bad. Not bad. You don't have to go hungry, Matthew. I don't mind sharing. I've got six of them in there. Oh, what? Those scrawny little things? No thanks. I think I'll stick to my two big, fat, juicy ones. OK? Matthew, I've been offered a new job. What? It'd be a big move. Is a new refinery going up? Yes. It's in Saudi Arabia. Yeah. (JOKINGLY) Right. What-- Are you-- Are you serious? At first, I thought it was a crazy idea, too. Travel halfway around the world. But once you get used to the idea, there's a lot of good things about the Middle East. I don't know, Dad. I'm-- Kind of like here. Yeah. But I wouldn't want to travel so much. And you and Logan would get to finish high school in Europe. You could see the world, Matt. New places, new people. The company will help us pay for it. You mean, like a-- Like a boarding school? Would they have a theater program? SAM: These places that are incredible. They have everything you love. Camping, the outdoors. (FADING OUT) One of them even has a-- [mournful music] Dennis? It's 4:30 in the morning. [dennis sighs] I wanted to be here, you know? It's not like I had a choice. I had to work. I had to support the family. I know. I didn't expect it to be so hard. Come on. Let's go to bed. We'll figure it out in the morning. [mournful music] With our doubt that has surfaced this time of night. Together with that fair and warlike form with which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes march, by heaven, I charge thee, speak. How, now! Horatio! - No, Matt. You jumped lines again. You charged me to speak. So, I spoke. Take it again. This time, be serious. Pablo, we've been through this a million times, OK? I think I got it. PABLO: (ANGRILY) By heaven, I charge thee, speak. [matthew barking] You could make a fool out of yourself in the play, too. Fine. I'll do it one more time. That is it. How now, Horatio. you tremble and you look pale. What now? I'm sorry. It's just-- You're not a Horatio. You know what I mean? You're not exactly pale-looking. Maybe a little tan, but you're not pale. God, you are such a screw off. You know that? Such a screw off. This will help. There we-- Matthew! Matthew! Oh, you are so dead. You are so death. [both laughing] - Matthew, get off me. - You're dead now. Matthew, get off me. My shirt! No, Matthew, Matthew. Matthew, we're even. Let me get your other, your other cheek. Let me get your cheek. Come on. Your other cheek. - No, we're not. Matt, we're even. Matthew? [quiet piano music] [knocking on door] Pantie raid. We're kidnapping you. What are you guys doing? Oh, we've got the munchies like so bad. You want to come eat with us? - I'm studying here. Yeah. And Casey's a virgin. Cut it out. I'm serious. [laughter] He's serious. Later, Serious. [sighs] Hey. - Hey. - Uh, we need to talk. About the play. Sure, come on in. You know, I--I--I should've just stayed in Wyoming. I don't even know why I came here. Why don't we just sit down, Matthew? We can talk about this. It make sense, OK? It's wrong. I mean, I'm supposed to-- It just-- God, it doesn't make sense. Matthew, sit down. Pablo, you don't understand. I can't be here right now. Matthew, why don't you talk to me about? In two days, the Shepards will again face the jury to ask for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney. Moment of closure for Wyoming, and perhaps for the Shepherd family, as well. The love Matthew found at boarding school wasn't the kind of love that Dennis or I have experienced, but it was equally valid. Huh. What? If I'm the jury, I just checked out. But he was in love. It was part of his life. You want me to just ignore it? I just don't want them thinking it was some kind of priss he wasn't. I don't-- I didn't mean it like that. I'm just saying, this is a Wyoming jury. He loved the outdoors. Why don't we just focus on that? So, other people are homophobic and we just go along with it. What does that say? It says we want McKinney dead. And there are certain rules we have to play by. And we're going to play by them. I didn't make them up, so don't get mad at me. Fine. Fine. Whatever. We'll just take it out. Leave it out. What are we doing? I'm going through everything he's ever done, trying to figure out what gets us the death penalty, and what doesn't. It's sick. Let's just finish this. I can't pick. I don't know what makes one life more valuable than another. I've got to mail these for the Foundation. Do you have to male that now? [door slams] [piano music playing] [sighs] JUDY (VOICEOVER): Maybe the love math Matthew found at boarding school wasn't the same as what Dennis or I had experienced. But it was just as real and meaningful. It made him happy. How now, Horatio. You tremble. And you look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? Is What think you want. But for my God, I might not believe this without the true and sensible avouch in mine own eyes. Is it now like the king? As thou are to thyself. Such was the very armor he wore when he the ambitious Norway combated. So too did he frown when he smote the slighted Pollacks on the ice. Tis strange. [speaking italian] Ooh. Your Italian is getting good. It's OK. [speaking italian] Si. Si. Dormitorio Kennedy. [speaking italian] Uh, mom. I'm going to need a little more spending money. We just sent you a check last week. Yeah, it's for spring break. The whole class is going to Morocco. Oh. I'll talk to your father. Is that the boy from the play? Yeah. Th-- That's Pablo. We hang out a lot. Oh. You know, your father was really disappointed he couldn't be here. We could only afford one ticket. Yeah. It's too bad. He should come out some time. There's great camping an hour from here. Oh, I'll tell him. [sighs] Well, I guess I better go wait for that cab. Yeah. Bye, sweetie. Take care. Be safe. I will. [slow, mournful piano music] Hey. Got you sprinkles. Make you feel better. Thank you. You know, I'm his mother. I should know what to say. Why is this so hard? Well, look at all you have been through. The trial and the foundation and being separated from Dennis. You have had zero time to grieve. But I-- I-- I write about him all the time. I write my own speeches. I talk about him all the time. And why-- why can't I write this? You know, maybe it's because these people, they say such stupid things about him. And I just want to set the record straight for once. Judy, it's a statement. I-- I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. What? I mean, how do you get up there and-- and-- and-- and tell people why they should kill someone. What do you say? What? You say anything. You get up there and read the phone book. It doesn't matter. That jury is going to give you the death penalty. The whole world is. You know that. Cal knows that. Even the defense knows it. I-- You know, it's just, it's not that simple. Yes, it is. If you want the death penalty, all you have to do is ask for it. And that's what you want, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Have a seat. Thanks. You having trouble with the statement? Oh. When the trial started, it was really hard to sit there and listen to this. But I thought, you know, it's going to be fine because we have a strong case, we're going to win, and get the death penalty. And then-- And then I'll feel better. And I don't feel better. I feel worse. What can I do? I need to talk to the defense. What? I need to know what they have to say to figure out what I'm going to do. Judy, after what they said about your son-- I only get one chance at this. And I've got to do it right. Dennis? He feels the same way? Just let me meet with them, OK? You sure you want to do this? Alright. Hello, hello. Judy, we are so glad that you're here. Please. [throat clearing] Well. Long trial, huh? Well, I'm sure that from where you were sitting, we probably seemed rather callous. No, I understand your job. You're very gracious. But even so, I just want you to know how sorry we were for what happened. And there's not one of us here who doesn't um-- doesn't hate, hate what our client did. Just tell her the offer. Go ahead. DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Two life sentences. No possibility of parole. Self-imposed gag order. And he would also waive all rights to an appeal. (SURPRISED) No appeals? He agreed to that? Mhmm. She would never, ever have to hear from him again. What we've got here is a kid who is begging for his life. Like my son was. Judy. Judy! Judy. Um. Look, I'm not going to pretend that my client deserves your mercy, but there's something telling me that if you weren't at least open to the idea, you wouldn't be here. Don't presume to know what I want. You don't know me. You don't know my son. [footsteps] [light flute music] [sighs] [light flute music] [upbeat drum music] (SING-SONG) I love Pablo. Yes sir-ree. Matthew. Cut it out. Or what? Oh. They don't even know us. Come on, sing with me. (SING-SONG) I love Pablo. And he loves-- It's your turn. It's your part. Matthew, you've been this all night long. And in front of our friends. It's just very uncomfortable. We're 1,000 miles from school. Anything goes here. Come on, man. Yes, but we have to go back there. So, who cares? OK? I'm tired of worrying about what everybody thinks. - Matthew. - I love you. Shouldn't I be able to say so? That's not the way the world works, Matthew. People judge. So-- so, what are we supposed to do? Are we going to hide for the rest of our lives? That's just stupid. That's reality. And I didn't make it up. So I don't want to hear anymore about it. MATTHEW: OK. OK. OK. OK. We'll just sit here like two little nuns. (SING SONG) I love Pablo. Yes sir-ree-- - That's it. I'm going back to the hotel. - Oh come on. - I'm going-- - I'm kidding. - I'm going back-- - Pablo. - --to the hotel. - I'm joking. I'll whistle. I'm whistle. Come on. Pablo. No, you don't get it, Matthew. Get? I don't want to be here with you. Pablo, I'm-- I'm kidding. [slow music] Oh, come on, man. MATTHEW: Pablo! [slow music & crickets chirping] [sighs] [angry yell] [matthew yelling] [ominous music] [matthew grunting and crying] [fast-paced music] [car tires squealing] [matthew grunting] [crying] [slow piano music] Matty? Hi, sweetheart. Are you OK? Oh, sweetheart. They raped me, Mom. It's OK. Oh, honey. Shh. I'll get you home. And everything's going to be all right. Mom? Yeah? I'm gay. I know, baby. I wanted to tell you. I know. I know. Shh. It's gonna be all right. Why was he so naive? Didn't we teach him better than that? I've been working on this all day. I'm not any closer. Why do we have to do it, anyway? Why do we have to justify Matthew's life to a bunch of strangers? Why can't we just say, execute him and be done with it. When do you suppose he knew? That he was gay, I mean. When do you suppose he first knew? I don't understand. I mean, what must it be like to keep something like that a secret from everyone you know? Poor Matthew. What What does that have to do with anything? Are we gonna feel better when McKinney's dead? Yes. No. I don't know. That's not the point. We have a day to finish this. We can't figure out everything. We're so busy trying to get the death penalty, we haven't figured out why we're doing it. What if they just put him away? We never heard about him again. What the hell is going on? I met with the defense. You did it without me? I didn't agree to anything. I just wanted to hear what they had to say. Dennis, it's a good deal. JUDY: Two consecutive life sentences. No possibility of appeal. Dennis. Dennis, stop. Please. Stop. What? Are you punishing me? Why should I punish you? I don't blame you for anything. I just want to remember my son. (ANGRILY) Your son was murdered. And you're selling him out for a damn plea, because you think it would be easier. Easier? I want him dead just as much as you do. (UPSET) I've been dealing with this for over a year. I sat in that courtroom every day. I listened to every detail. Every detail of what they did to our child. And then he said that he was asking for it. You think that was easy? No. No, it's not. But I'm sorry. This is not about us. It's about him. You take that plea, you take it by yourself. [door slamming] [protestors shouting] [thunder rumbling] MAN: What do you think? Hey. Hey. [slow piano music] Thank you, friend. I opened that for ya. Yep. [slow sad music] - Bye. - Oh. Good luck, OK? - You too. Good luck. - (TEASING) He's cute. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's my brother. Leave him alone. You'll mess him up. - Catch you later. Take care, guys. DENNIS: Nice-looking girl, Matty. Ooh, so proud of you. Thanks. You did good, son. Congratulations. Thanks. Well. You want to just meet up with us later? Uh, yeah. Can I? Yeah. Go ahead. Thanks. [girls giggling] GIRLS: Come with us. Do you want something to drink? Come on. Come with us. We'll get you one. [judy laughing] So that's him? Yup. Hmm. Now, enough with the cute girl stuff. Oh, come on. He doesn't pay any attention to me, anyway. You're supposed to be supportive. I support him. And he knows that. I know. All right. I'll back off. A guy can dream, can't he? [judy giggles] Shima tells me your mom's taking you back to Wyoming. You're going back to UW? Big deal, huh? Look, uh, I gotta go. They're waiting for me. With Wait. Can't you just explain? It's like you just evaporated after Morocco. Pablo. I got to go. Matt. [sad, quiet music] And this metal pipe went down 10 feet into the earth. I swear to God, Norris started to cry. [chuckling] Tell Matty about that time-- Oh, you remember. Gosh, you remember-- Who cares, mom? Matty, that's not nice. You're just talking to take up space. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. DENNIS: Don't be that way, Matt. MATTHEW: It doesn't mean anything. Like what? We're here for you. We're here for you, Matty. They took my shoes. In Morocco, they took my shoes. I still can't understand why after everything they had done, why they would do something like that. Honey, you don't have to talk about this anymore. It's all going to be OK. (ANGRILY) It's not going to be OK, mom. I mean, if it was OK, do you think we would be here right now? We're trying to help. You're not trying to help. You're trying to make it safe. And it's not. And I-- God, I-- I can't keep telling you guys that without you freezing up all the time. God-- I-- I-- I look at everyone else. Logan, everyone that I grew up with, and their lives just turn out so perfect. Just so peachy. College, university, high school. Good-- good grades, good jobs. Not me. No way. Not the fag from Laramie. Matt. Don't talk about yourself that way. Nobody thinks of you that way, Matthew. That's how everybody thinks about me. (SHOUTING) That's what I am. I'm a queer. I'm-- I'm a homo. I'm a-- - All right. We get it. - I'm a homo! - You're gay. - I'm a-- I'm a flaming faggot. All right? I do it with other guys, dad. What do you have to say about that? [slow music] That's my point. Everything I do, everything I go through, I have to do it on my own. I can't-- I can't talk to you. I can't talk to anybody. You're supposed to love me and you-- Yet you don't even know who I am. [sad music] MAN: Hell's not so bad. Do you like to drink? Yeah, I like to drink, the guy says. Well, you're going to love Mondays. That's open bar night here in hell. Do you like getting stoned? You're going to love Wednesdays. That's all the weed you can smoke day. And the Devil flashes him a big smile, and he says, so, are you gay? And the guy says, Hell no! I'm no homo. Ooh. That's bad. You're gonna hate Fridays. [men laughing] You're gonna hate Fridays? It's just a joke. I've been thinking about Matthew all day. Tonight, it was like he was right there beside me. I heard it the way he would have. And you know what? It isn't a joke. It's a little piece of hate shot like an arrow. My god, how did this kid do it? How many arrows struck him every day? They fall off you and me, Judy. I've even told a joke like that before. They were shot right at him. My God. I never knew how he felt. I never knew at all. I thought I did, but I didn't. We've got to go for it, Judy. I'm more sure of that than ever. McKinney's somebody's son, too. Sure. But hard as it is, it's the single piece of justice we're going to get out of all this. It's an eye for an eye. It's the message we can send to the world, that the jokes, the hate, Matt's death, it's unacceptable. (VOICE RISING) And if we're not strong enough to demand justice, who will? [slow music] See, we couldn't protect Matthew when he was alive. But we can make sure that Matt didn't die for nothing. CASEY (ON VIDEO): Matthew! SHIMA (ON VIDEO): Matthew! MATTHEW (ON VIDEO): Fine! Would you-- [all laughing on video] MATTHEW (ON VIDEO): Would you give me a hand here? My God. JUDY (VOICEOVER): Dennis and I decided that when college started, I'd move back to the States with Matthew. I guess it could be that subconsciously we felt like we'd failed him and needed to play catch up. He was so shaken by Morocco. Someone had to help. You OK? What are you looking for? Honey? I can't-- I can't find-- I can't find my pills. First day back in school. I need my pills. What about the zipper, um, thing? (FRUSTRATED) I already looked in the zipper. It's not in the zipper. [zipping sounds] You OK? (QUIETLY) Yeah. You know, you really have to take these pills every day. The doctor said those panic attacks-- I know. I know. I know, Mom. --are not a joke. Know Sweetheart, I mean-- All right. - OK, bye. Good luck! MAN: Hey, Sam, catch. GIRL: I've gotta go. MAN: See you Friday. He said he'd meet us here at 2 o'clock. Romaine, you get called about every new boy toy in town. How do I get on this phone list? It's a school counseling center, not a dating service. Yeah, speak for yourself, sweetheart. [giggling] Hi. So, you must be the new fag on the block. Yeah. You've got that telltale deer in the headlights look. Who, me? - Come on in. We won't bite. Hey, Matthew. I'm Romaine. - Hi. Hi. Lance. Welcome to Queerville. Donny. I am. How am I supposed to know what douche means? And do I want to room with one? No, I don't think so. So, Saudi Arabia. Switzerland. - Yeah, what are you? Rich or something? Oh, hardly. It's my dad's job. How did you end up in Laramie? I'm-- I'm from here. Bitch, that's the point. You should know better. What-- What are you still doing here if you hate it so much? Well, I came for the culture. [romaine giggling] - I have a higher calling. Oh, please. I do. I'm an evangelist to the misguided cowboys. And your message? They can kiss my gay white ass. [all laughing] [doorbell rings] Mom, you want to grab that for me? Hi. Hi. You must be Matty's mom. I'm Donny. [exaggerated kissing noises] MATTHEW: I'll be right out! He's such a little princess. He takes longer in the bathroom than I do. MATTHEW: Does anybody want to tell me where we're going? Going? We are going for a walk. [country music playing] We're going to die. Come on, girl. Get up here. No, thank you. I think I'm fine back here. [sighs] Come on, dude. Hang a U. Look it! Look it over there. Can you believe this? Hey! Fairy. What are you freaks doing here? You have got to be kidding me. - You gonna call me, cowboy? - Donny. Shut up. TRUCK MAN: Yeah, shut up, faggot. Screw you, breeder. I look better than your wife. - Ah, you little-- MATTHEW: Go, go. Go. Go. Hurry, run. TRUCK MAN: Come on. MATTHEW: Hurry. [truck tires squealing] [breathing hard] TRUCK MAN: Back up. Back up. Back up. Come on out, you little faggots. Come on. [laughter] They're gone. What did-- [party music] [indistinct chatter] [muted party music] DONNY: Hey, Judy. Got a houseful of trouble. [music gets louder] - Mom. - Hi. Hey, come on. Grab a-- Grab a beer. Who wants me? [whoops] How was dinner? Oh, it was good. It was good. So, when you guys gonna knock off? Uh, you know, a couple hours. Is that OK? Just, uh, you know, it's the neighbors. Mom. It's 9:30. It's not just the time. It's just, uh-- DONNY: Chips straight to my hips. Hi. Hi. Um. Bye. You know what these people are like. I mean, they see your friends coming and going. And then everybody's watching. Next thing, everybody's talking. - I don't believe this. - No, well. [inaudible] Starts to talk. All (INCREDULOUS) You're asking me to stay in the closet? Matthew. I'm just saying-- In my own house? I'm saying you should be very careful who you come out to. I just want you-- - Mom. God. - --be safe. Matthew. Hey, Matthew. No. You OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Romaine? What do you say I go to Denver with you? You don't have to help me clean up. I can handle it. MATTHEW: I can handle it myself. I don't mind. Whatever. I'm screwing this up, aren't I? Matty, I think we should think about you finding your own apartment. I'm really not trying to run your life. Mom. I think I'm going to go to Denver with Romaine. You have to finish school. You said it yourself. I have to remember where I am. They're never going to accept me here. Come on. I don't think you're ready for that kind of a change. It's a big city. - I know. With a community. With people like me. I'll finish school, I promise. I'll go back. And-- And it's not like I'm going alone. Romaine will be there. Come on, Mom. Please? OK. [music playing] JUDY (VOICEOVER): When your child dies, you torture yourself with second guessing. Then you learn it's a waste of time. So, you ask other questions. What happened in Denver was always a blank spot in our son's life. We knew in our gut it was painful. So we avoided it. But there is nothing more painful than life without Matthew. I needed to know what went on there. We both did. Is Romaine, uh-- Patterson. Patterson here? Hi. Oh my God. Aren't you guys supposed to be in court tomorrow? What are you doing here? Mostly feeling really out of place. [chuckles] DENNIS: We'd like to talk to you. No, we thought we'd like to buy you some lunch. That'd be great. ROMAINE (VOICEOVER): So, after we got to Denver, I thought he'd call me immediately, but I didn't hear from him for the longest time. And then, out of the blue, he shows up here insisting that I had to come to his new place and check it out. So, I went with him. Oh, you should have seen him. He was so proud. He made a home for himself without any help from anyone. This is Gomez. I consider Gomez a doorman. Hey, Matt. [DOGS BARKING AND CHILDREN CRYING] Here it is. Wow. [matthew sighs] Not bad, huh? Not bad. [chuckles] So? Very cool. Very, very cool. But you could use a few more bottles. Yeah, I'm working on that. Matthew, I thought that you were going to get a place in the District. Yeah. Maybe a closet. So it's not the best location. It's a great apartment. It's close to the District. And most important, it's mine. Isn't that great? Yeah, it's pretty cool. Seriously. Just be careful. This isn't the greatest part of town. My god. You're my mother disguised as a lesbian. [judy chuckles] ROMAINE (VOICEOVER): And what happened afterwards? Well, he had to deal with the crap that we all have to deal with. Excuse me. There's no price on this. Uh, I think this is a store special. $11.98 for the small bottle. There'll be tax on that? You know what? I think you're better off saving your money. Bottle of calcium will do the same thing. And it's two bucks. Thank you. You're welcome. It was $11. And you sold a $2 bottle of calcium. Do the math. You people have no sense of business at all. It was just one person. She was paying in pennies. Listen, just go to the stock room and stack boxes or something til you figure out if you want to do this job or not. I-- I do want to do this. I'm good at it. I sell more of those things than anybody. You're asking me to rip off old people. I'm asking you to stop acting like such a pansy. Think you could handle that for eight hours a day? I need some air. What's happening, Matt? [pop music playing] WOMAN (THROUGH WALL): So I saw someone moved in next door. MAN (THROUGH WALL): Yeah, some homo. Place is overrun with em. Like a rat. MAN (THROUGH WALL): Shut up with your banging next door, ya faggot. Shut up! [banging on wall] [music gets louder] MAN (THROUGH WALL): Turn off the damn music, or I'm gonna come in there and turn it off for ya! [banging on wall] MAN (THROUGH WALL): Turn off that damn music. I want some peace and quiet, you dumb faggot. Peace. And quiet. [clanging on floor] MAN (THROUGH WALL): Put that bottle down. [shouting through the walls] [child crying through walls] [matthew breathing heavily] [slow haunting music] [dog barking] MAN (THROUGH WALL): Leave it alone! MAN (THROUGH WALL): You all right up there? Hey, Matty. I've got something for you. It's for your apartment. Hmm. A fairy for a fairy. It's an angel. That was gross. I quit my job. Oh, great. Good decision. Romaine, the place was run by a moron. I wasn't going to take his crap. Matty, the world isn't gonna roll over for us. The key is to stay in the game. And to keep your dignity. Did you notice the emphasis on staying in the game? You know, this place was supposed to be better. Maybe I'm not good enough. Maybe I don't know how to act like a queer. Lighten up. It'll turn out OK. I'll make you a free capp. Here. An angel for an angel. [sighs] [woman shouting in spanish] [ominous music playing] [music - "devil inside"] [woman shouting through walls] [matthew grunting] [phone ringing] [phone beeps] MATTHEW (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi, it's Matt. Leave a message. [phone beeps] JUDY (ON PHONE): Matthew? It's Mom. [sighs] Hey mom. JUDY (ON PHONE): Are you there? Pick up if you are. Mhmm. JUDY (ON PHONE): I'm worried about you, sweetie. We haven't heard from you in a while. Call us. Collect. We love you. [slow background music] (GROGGILY) I'm great. I'm just tired. Tired. JUDY (VOICEOVER): We always regretted not being able to stay closer to Matt while he was in Denver and we were in the Middle East. We came back to try to help him restart his life. [knocking on door] Is he OK? Yeah. He'll be fine. [lock clicking] [door opening] ROMAINE: Matty? Matty, you OK? JUDY: Matty? DENNIS: Hey, Matty. It was like he'd been to that really dark place and came out the other side knowing what he wanted. And you know, after all the crap he went through, what was it? You know, he wanted to help people. And he would have done it, too. Like, you know the day he moved out? OK, first of all, that was, like, one of the saddest days of my life. MATTHEW: Ooph. [matthew grunting] Ooh-wah. You really going back to Laramie? It's hard to believe I'd leave this paradise, huh? And they accepted your enrollment at the school? Yep. School starts on Monday. Well, it's about time you started listening to me. I owe you my entire life, your highness. [romaine laughs] You know, every journey starts with a single step? That's me. Nice one, Matty. You found your epiphany in a fortune cookie. It's true. That's why I'm going to major in political science, become a diplomat, travel around the world, help people. Make the world a better place, you know? ROMAINE (VOICEOVER): So, later on, I'm all crying and all. And then the phone rings. So, of course, it's Matty, right? He forgot his jacket, so I've got to go back to his place to pick it up for him. And this guy, his neighbor who's been basically driving him crazy for months, is standing out in the hallway with this glass angel that Matthew left behind for him. WOMAN (THROUGH WALL): Jim, come here, your mother's calling. MAN (THROUGH WALL): Take a message. I can't come right now. Why'd you leave this at my door? I didn't. Matthew did. Hmm. Look what it does. Yeah, he thought you'd like it. He was just staring at it like, I so don't deserve this thing. You know? It was perfect. It was like Matthew had the last word. And it was a good one. [music playing] Thanks. I'll be there tomorrow. Bye, Judy. Bye. He was a good kid. Yeah. He was just like you. The world hurts you, and you try to make it better. He was like you, too. No. The world hits me. And I hit back. I've been thinking about what you said. And I think I'm ready to, you know, start telling some people. Oh yeah? What about your family? No, they'd kill me. Only a little bit. At first. You know, you're going to think the whole world hates you. But you'd be surprised who ends up standing in your corner. Trust me on that. [music playing] [shower running] [music playing] Hey. A glass of beer, please. Hey. I need to go out there. I need to see it. I need to see the fence. And I'm not sure I could do it without you. [lonesome music playing] [soft rock music playing] MCKINNEY: Let's get some more. RUSSELL: Can I get another pitcher? [inaudible] Hey. This place is dirty. Don't touch it. Oh. MATTHEW: Thanks, man. MCKINNEY: You know it's OK. I mean, we're gay, too. I felt like-- (RELIEVED) I-- I thought you guys were going to jump me. No. What? Well, you-- you followed me in here. And I just thought-- We're not going to tell you there. No, no. I-- I guess not. Uh, hey, listen. It was nice meeting you guys. I'm gonna take off. Yeah. Yeah. OK, then. What, are you leaving already? It's early. MATTHEW: Yeah, you know, I got class tomorrow. I'm tired. College boy, right? Good for you, man. Um, hey. You know, we could give you a ride home, if you want. Really? MCKINNEY: Yeah, it's not a big deal or anything. Yeah? OK. Yeah. All right, then. Why did he go with them, Judy? He spends his whole life looking for a place where he can fit. He finally finds it and they tie him to the damn fence. [mournful music] I keep playing it over and over in my head. All the things we did wrong. All things I wish I had done differently. But none of it matters. They always kill him in the end. [mournful music] [dennis sighs] You stay. It's OK. [slow music] [judy sniffs] [music intensifies] [judy sobs] [kissing sound] This is the last thing he saw. (VOICE CRACKING) It's beautiful. I didn't expect that. I need McKinney dead, Judy. I know. He deserves to die. [sniffs] But the tribute to Matthew's life shouldn't be McKinney's death. [dennis sighs and sniffs] Our son was beautiful. And when you have something beautiful, you should show it to the world. You should use it to give something, not take something away. I want to take the plea. I can't. [protesters chanting] MALE REPORTER: What do you think about the sentence? FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. McKinney! Mr. McKinney! PROTESTER: The Bible says that Matthew should-- FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. McKinney, what do you think? Do you think you'll get the death penalty? Mr. McKinney! A few words, please. [protesters yelling] Anything else? [inaudible] OK everybody. Here we go. Can everybody hear me? OK. There's going to be a lot of people out there saying a lot of really horrible things about Matthew. And you're going to want to respond. But remember, there's a big difference between what people say and what things are. So, earplugs in. And keep smiling. Remember, you're Matthew's angels. [gentle music] [protesters clamoring] PROTESTER: The ways of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. But he loves the man who preserves-- PROTESTER: God hates fags. PROTESTER: Homosexuality is-- JUDGE: Mr. Shepard, the prosecutor informs me of your desire to address the jury. Now you understand that you are under no obligation to do so. But if that is still your desire, you may address the court at this time. My son, Matthew, officially died on October 12, 1998. But he actually died the Wednesday before when you-- You, Mr. McKinney, with your friend, Mr. Henderson, left him out there to die by himself. But he wasn't alone. He had his longtime friends with him. The beautiful night sky. The daylight, and the sun to shine on him one last time. He had the smell of Wyoming sagebrush and the scent of pine trees from the snowy range. And he had God. I feel better knowing he wasn't alone. Our lives will never be the same. We miss Matt terribly. We think about him all the time, at odd moments when little things remind us of him. When we walk by the refrigerator, and see pictures of him. And at special times of the year, like the first day of classes at UW, or the opening day of hunting season. We always wonder what would have happened. What would he have become? How would he have changed his corner of the world to make it better? Matthew was not my gay son. He was my son, who happened to be gay. And I was proud of him. He became a symbol, some say. A martyr, putting a boy next door face on hate crimes. That's fine with me. He would be thrilled to know his death helped others. Mr. McKinney, Judy and I believe that there are incidents and crimes that justify the death penalty. And even Matthew would agree that this is one of them. My son died because of your ignorance and intolerance. I can't bring him back. But I can do my best to make sure this never happens again. I believe in the death penalty. I want nothing more than to see you die. (QUIETLY) However, this is a time for healing. This is a time to show mercy to one who refused to show mercy. Every time you celebrate Christmas, or the 4th of July, remember. Matt isn't. Every time you wake up, remember Matthew won't. Every time you breathe, remember Matthew doesn't. You robbed us of something very precious. And I will never forgive you for that. [deep breath] Mr. McKinney, I give you life in memory of one who no longer lives. May it be a long life. And may you thank Matthew every day for it. [soft music] [crying] [MUSIC - ELTON JOHN, "AMERICAN TRIANGLE"] Seen him playing in his backyard. Young boy just starting out. So much history in this landscape. So much confusion, so much doubt. Been there drinking on that front porch. Angry kids, mean and dumb. Looks like a painting, that blue skyline. God hates fags where we come from. 'Western skies' don't make it right. 'Home of the brave' don't make no sense. I seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire left to die on a high ridge fence. It's a cold, cold wind. It's a cold, cold wind. It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming. See two coyotes running down a deer. Hate what we don't understand. You pioneers give us your children, but it's your blood that stains their hands. [MUSIC - RANDI DRISCOLL, "WHAT MATTERS] You were the brightest angel heaven had ever seen. You walked in with a story to tell and ten thousand tongues to scream. And you said, doesn't your heart beat the same as mine? Haven't I told you a thousand times, isn't the air in my lungs the same air you breathe. So who cares whose arms I'm all wrapped up in? Who cares whose eyes I see myself in?
