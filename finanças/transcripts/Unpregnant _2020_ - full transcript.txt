- Two minutes. You're fine. You're fine. You always use a condom. Oh, my God. - Oh. - Yeah. - Oh... ow! - Sorry. - Hello? Look, I'm sure things are really scary right now, but, you know, it's probably gonna be okay. Um... is there anything I can do to help? I mean, like, I have a car. I can, like, drive you home if you want. You can leave. Wait... No way. If that is who I think it is, I was just way too nice. Ugh, a real blast from the past. Hey, dude. Oh, Jesus. - Come on, like I haven't seen you pee a thousand times. There was actually a time when you wouldn't pee without me. - Bailey, can you just... - So who's the lucky guy, huh? Oh, no... is it Kevin? - Where's my test? - Ooh. Ooh! Is it Kevin? Please tell me. Please tell me, come on. - Please give it to me. - Who's the daddy? - Just give it to me please. - Whose penis is it? - Kevin's penis. - See, was that so hard? Actually, don't answer that. I don't wanna know. Wow, so you're, um, with child. And it's definitely Kevin's? - Yes, yes. What kind of girl do you think I am? - I don't know, man. I didn't think you boned, let alone raw dog... I'm honestly, like, a little impressed. - I do not "raw dog." We use condoms, which are supposed to be 98.7% effective. - Well, apparently, one of them was 0%. - That's not how statistics work. - Are you reading this right? - Uh... - Oh, hey, Veronica. - Heather. - I'm so glad I caught you. Would you mind looking at the layout for the yearbook prom page? Let me just pull it back up... - Whoa, no. No spoilers on the yearbook. Come on, dude, God. - Um, okay. Why don't you email that to me, Heather, and then I can really process the nuances of the squiggly border that you chose. - I'm so glad you noticed the b... - Ronnie. - Oh, hey, hey. - You okay, Ronnie? You seem a little flustered. - Yeah, yeah. - Are you trying to talk to Bailey Butler? - Remember when you guys used to be besties? - Yeah, that was... that was more 'cause our moms were close and everything. - Speaking of parents, mine are in Greece. Wanna stay over this weekend? - Who's got that green nail polish that I like? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell? - Where is it? - Oh, I wrote your name on it, and then I tied it to the flagpole. Hope that's cool. - Can you just give it to me? - I threw it in the dumpster behind the gym. - Oh. Well, thank you. Thank you for bringing it all the way back there. - Eh, I was smoking a joint back there anyway. Mr. Aster's been screening this "Osmosis Jones" VHS in bio, so I gotta come correct. - It's unbelievable. - Right? There's, like, barely any hard science in it, but Chris Rock is a visionary. - No, you're smoking on school grounds. That's, like, really irresponsible. - Oh, I'm the irresponsible one? - Okay. - Ah, okay, okay, okay, ah, look. I mean, I'm sure it's gonna be okay, though? I mean, your sister had a kid early, and she's fine, right? Remember when we found out that you were gonna be a nine-year-old aunt? We were cracking up... - Okay, okay, you can stop. I appreciate what you did with the test and everything, but we're not just like... You just happened to be the person that walked in the bathroom. - Oof. Could have left it at thanks. Catch you on the flip, Juno. - Guys, check this out. Look at this. - Let me see it. - Oh, my God. Hi, hi, um, hi. I, uh, am doing a report for my health class, and I just wanted to see if I could ask a quick question? Cool, thanks. Um, if a young woman needs a procedure, but her parents didn't know, is that possible? Uh, let's say she's 17. Okay, okay, so not at your facility. Where's the closest place that... There's an Albuquerque in Missouri? Okay, um, well, sorry. What about, like, Illinois or Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas? No? Okay, okay, so I get it. It sounds like she would need parental consent, which is... that's great. That's totally fine. Uh, I will include that in my report, and thank you very much, bye. - Mom, I'm gonna go to Emily's for a cram weekend. - Trust you. Love you. - That was so stupid. Maddie B is gonna... - Hey. - Hey. - Oh, my gosh, hey, girl. - Sorry I'm late. - Who'd you guys... - Okay, Maddie D. - No, not Maddie D. - Um, there's actually something pretty important I have to talk to you guys about. - Okay, just give me one second. I'm actually really close. - Yeah, "Veronica Mars" over here thinks that she can figure out the pregnancy test mystery thing. - What pregnancy test mystery thing? - Look. - Recycle Club found it in the dumpster. - Ugh, Maddie B's profile's on private. No. - Ooh, okay. So Tori Leonards wasn't in gym today, and I know for a fact that she used "lady issues" as her excuse. - You use that excuse to skip gym, like, every other week. - Valid, which is actually why I'm leaning more towards Patricia Hamilton? - Absolutely not, no. There's no way Patricia Hamilton has lost her V card. - Well, it's, like, none of our business, right? - I know, but it's just so juicy, I gotta figure out who it is. - I mean, what if it was one of us? - Totally, but who takes a pregnancy test at school? - Okay, seriously, look at these grams, though, side by side. Patricia's belly definitely looks bigger. Literally only a week ago. - A little bit. - The way she's standing there. - No, that's not, like, a burrito belly. Like, that's significantly bigger. - No, it's literally bigger, like her face even... - She's glowing. I mean, it's kind of... - Mwah, I'm so sorry I'm late, babe. Got a new pup at the shelter. Had to get him squirreled away. Yeah, check it out. Named him Jasper. - Uh, yeah, it's... thanks for... - Looks like Elliot's dog, right? - Meeting me so last minute and everything. - Course. - Good evening. - Hey. - Welcome, welcome. - Thank you. We will start off with the cheesy breadsticks, and a water for the lady, and I'll go with a Mountain Dew. - All right, coming right up. - What's up? - Um... so... I have to tell you something. Um, I don't know how it happened. Statistically, it's, like, nearly impossible, but, uh... I'm pregnant. Okay. Okay, hey, it's okay. I'm... I'm here for you. Thank you. That's such a relief. I... I mean, I know what I want to do, and I have a plan. I could just use really use your help with some... What's happening right now? - Will you marry me? Look, I know it won't be easy, okay? But, babe, we can do this. - Can you sit back down in your chair please? - Yeah, yeah. You gotta admit, it's kind of perfect timing, you know? We were so unsure about us next year, you know, and now we have this. You know, we'll take a year off, get a little place in town so our parents can help out, and don't worry... the birth won't conflict with the X Games schedule whatsoever, so... - Wait, wait, wait... how is it that you already have all of that planned? - Well, I mean, you said you had something important that you wanted to tell me. Um... you know, and then the whole mystery pregnancy test thing reminded me of this other little thing. Um, don't get mad but, remember, like, a month ago at Smith Creek when we got finished in the car? Well, I sort of noticed that the, um... the condom had broke. So... - Are you kidding me? - Look, Veronica, I didn't want to freak you out, okay? - Oh, my... - The valedictorian thing... You had a lot on your mind, you know? And the further away we got, the more mad I knew you'd be... - Kevin, I... oh... - And I looked it up. I Googled it. Do you know how hard it is to get pregnant? It is, like, so hard. - I literally could have taken the morning after pill. I could have avoided this whole entire situation. - I know it's kind of stressful, okay? But it's also kind of perfect because now we really know that we'll be together forever. - I'm serious. I can't. I need to get out of here. - Veronica... Oh, shoot. Oh, God. Oh, it's morning sickness. Here, let me... I'll hold your hair for you. - Don't touch me. - Okay. Look, I know I messed up, okay? But if you can see past that, there's something that's so beautiful here, and I'm so stoked to bring a little us into this world. - Can I... can I look at that? - Yeah, can I... - No, I'll just... - Okay. - Wow, this doesn't look cheap. How'd you afford this? - Sold Buzzsaw and Road Rash. Uh, my dirt bikes. Only down to two now, but... it's okay. - You know, I'm definitely gonna need some time to think about it, but let's talk on Monday, okay? - Oh, yeah, Monday. Monday's good. - Whew. Great. Crap. I just pwned your ass! - Ha, ha, ha, ha. You won't be laughing when I literally rip your balls off, scumbag. Come on. Wait, cover me. I'll be right back. I thought you were staying in tonight. - Oh, I know. I'm sorry. Fil got the night off. - Oh, man, that guy's weird. Who spells "Phil" with an F? - Be nice. - Wait. I already started thawing the dough. - I'm sorry, my little pea, but you know, we can make the coxinhas tomorrow or, you know what, maybe Sunday. I'll text you when I know how the weekend is shaping up, okay? Mwah. How do I look? - Hot as hell. - Mm-hmm, bye. - Bye. - Oh, dude, come on. The whole pregnancy mystery bullshit thing is not my fault. I threw the thing in the dumpster. - I need your help, and I don't have anywhere else to go. - I'm listening. - Okay, I know we're not, like, close anymore. - True. - And I'm probably the last person that you wanna help... - Accurate. - But you have a car. - Oh, there it is. - Trust me. If I could just go somewhere in town or to St. Louis even, I wouldn't even be here. - Go where? - You know, to get the thing... The procedure. - Whoa. - Okay. - You printed a map. - Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico... It's easy, and I outlined the best route including where we can stop for gas, food, and rest. It's all planned out. We'll be in Albuquerque by tomorrow night. We'll go to the clinic first thing Sunday morning, and we'll be home Sunday evening. - Albuquerque. - Yeah, yeah, I know it sounds crazy, but that is the closest place if you're under 18, so... - And I don't have to, like, be there during, right? Say if I wanted to go explore Albuquerque while you're doing your thing. - Yeah, that's... that's fine, I guess. I really just need you to drive. I'll pay for everything. - Hm... so you're hiding this from your man, your best friends, and your Jesus freak parents, and you thought, "Why not ask Bailey Butler "to drive me hundreds of miles 'cause she probably doesn't have anything to do anyway." - Um... kind of, yes. Bailey. Bailey, come on. Please open the door, Bailey. - I'm just messing with you. You're right... I do not have anything going on. - I thought you drove a Camry. - Sleater-Camry's in the shop. - Uh, my gas projections were accounting for a four-cylinder Japanese engine. - My bad. If we're worried about gas, we should just take the Tesla. - Whoo, road trip! - Oh, oh, oh, we gotta check out Roswell. Like, there's actual aliens... - No. No. - Veronica, come on. It's my vacation too. - This is not a vacation, okay? - Well, if it's not a vacation, then why are you taking pictures, huh? - Okay, in 20 miles, we're gonna make our first stop. - Yes, yes, love stops. We should go check out the world's biggest fork. I actually hear that... - No, no, Bailey. We're not just gonna be stopping willy-nilly, okay? We need to stick to the schedule so I can be home by Sunday evening, and my parents won't find out. Every stop has a purpose. - Wow, you even bummed out nature. - This trip is not gonna be cheap, but I think that this should cover it. - Whoa, Jesus, what... did you steal that from your parents? - Kevin proposed. What? Oh, my God. That is actually so on brand for him. Could you imagine, like, actually getting married to that guy? What, would your first dance be to Imagine Dragons or Nickelback, do you think? - Kevin... he means well, okay? You just don't know him. He's... he's uncomplicated. He's sweet. He's so sweet. Did you know that he volunteers with little puppies, like, that don't have homes and stuff? And I don't even need to defend myself to you now. But did you know that he asked me out literally every day for a month until I said yes? He literally waited outside my window one night for a whole night. - You know, "Say Anything" made that seem cute, but it's called stalking, so time's up on all that. That dude's an actual stalker. - Okay, the entrance should be right up around the corner here. - Cool, I'm excited to die here. - It's not opening. I know they're not closed. That guy literally just went in there. - After you, Ivy League. - I said I ain't gonna buy it. - Move. - Hello, hi. Um... I was actually just wondering how much I could get for this. It's, like, real and everything. - Mm-hmm. How old are you? - 17. - I can't buy this. - Um... sorry, I just... I just... I really, really need the money, so if there's just anything... - I said... - Veronica, I love you. - Stalker. - Kevin. - I can't live without you. - What are you doing here? Did you follow me? - I know you said you wanted to wait until Monday, but to me, Monday feels like it's ten years from now, you know? So I said, "Bro, go get your girl." This really is not a good time. - Look, I got you a rose for every single reason why we should spend our lives together... You, me, and the baby. - It's not a baby yet. - This is for how rad your genes and my genes are gonna look together in a new human. This one is for when I teach him or her how to do a perfect kickflip. - Weird flex. - And this one is for the fact that you get to stay here in Missouri... - Okay, you know what? This has got to stop. I can't do it. Here are a bunch of roses. They're a bunch of reasons. - What is she doing with my ring? - Uh... well, I need the money for... I'm sorry, Kevin, but I'm taking care of the situation. - You're... you wanna get rid... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I know it wasn't chill to not tell you about the condom breaking... - Whoa, you knew about the condom breaking? - Yeah, I'm sorry. Who even asked you? Why is she even here? - She's driving me to the place. I can't do it in Missouri. - Well, you can't make this decision alone. - Kevin, we have so much life ahead of us. This is just... This is what I have... - What life, Veronica? You're going off to Brown. I'm staying here. This is our shot at being together. - No, Kevin... - You should be thankful and count your lucky stars that you have a guy who's so devoted to you that he would literally track you down to this freaking skeezy dump. - You tracked me here? - Well, I mean, like, kind of. What are you doing? - That's so creepy, Kevin! You're a stalker! - Thank you. - Give me my ring back then. Jesus! - Consider your next move very carefully. - That is my ring. I paid for that. Okay. Gonna grab my phone. I got it. - I mean, could have just deleted your Find My Friends app. - I'll give you $1,300. - We're rich! - Are you serious? Thank you. I don't even know how to begin to thank you. This is... you are such a sweet woman for helping us. - If any of this comes back on me, I'll sew the two of you together as a human centipede. - Oh. - You know, it's pretty messed up that Kevin didn't even tell you about the condom breaking. - I really don't wanna talk about it. - I know, I'm just saying that you had every right to sell that ring after what he did. - Really don't wanna talk about it. Can you just drop it for now, please? - All right. I'm just gonna turn on the radio. [The Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go?" Oh, oh! Okay, okay, okay. - That song literally makes zero sense. It's... it just makes... Okay, he's saying if he leaves, there will be trouble, but if he stays, there will be double? What... the choice is clearly to leave. It's literally half the amount of trouble. Wow. Man, that has gotta be the most clinical interpretation of a punk song, like, ever. - Okay, if we drive for another, like, five hours, we... - Oh, a Gas N' Gulp! - Wow, I see you're taking the budget really seriously. - Hm, oh, and you have, like, what, three sips of water in that thing? - Well, we're driving 14 hours. We can't be stopping every two seconds to pee. We actually really have to go... So are you done? - One more thing. - Hi, these and a few more things. - Half blue raspberry, half cherry with a squirt of Coke on top. - Our combo. - Yep. - Thank you. This is really sweet of you. - I mean, relax. It was two for one. - If we make good enough time, we can maybe go to Roswell. - Stop. Hell yeah, aliens! Maybe. - Okay? - What time's your appointment on Sunday? - We're almost in Oklahoma where we'll take a four hour powernap... and we should be getting to some open areas in about 18 miles, and that's gonna be the perfect place to stop. - Nice. Love a good open area. Ooh, we're about to cross state lines. You know what that means. - No, no... - Yep. - I... I don't remember that. - Three... - No, seriously that was so... - Two... - Long ago... I don't even know... - One. Whoo, whoo! Boom, boom. Mm, mm. - Zoom. Ooh. - Ah! Both: Much-coach Pu! Haven't done that one in a while. - Yeah, I... I really don't know how we remembered that whole thing. Wow, it's really messy in here. What is all this you have down here? - Whoa, whoa, do not throw that. - Why do you have a taser? - Oh, I was hoping to hold up some liquor stores on the way. Hope that's cool. - No. - Veronica, we are two teenage girls going across the country in the middle of the night. I took that from my mom, okay? Can you put it in my bag? - Okay. - It's not gonna tase you, Veronica. - I don't know how they work. - Very easy. Point and shoot. Got extra blankets in the back. - No, I'm fine. This will be comfortable. - Okay, suit yourself. - I'm setting the alarm for 5:00 a.m., okay? That way, we'll be in Texas by lunch. I have $20 set aside for breakfast, so we can stop somewhere early. And, Bailey, you've really gone overbudget with the jacket and stuff, so can you just please be more mindful? - Do you have, like, a PowerPoint presentation? I'm a little bit more of a visual learner. - You know what? Actually, I do. Let me just pull it up really quick. Where are the blankets? - In the back. - "Selfcare" huh? - Yeah, I had to post something so people wouldn't bother me. - Of course, and so people wouldn't know you're with me. Your stuff's, like, really intense. - Colleges look at that sort of thing, so it's strategic. - Before we would've laughed at that kind of stuff, but I guess that's not who you strategically are anymore. - You know what? I'm not gonna do this right now. We only have four hours for sleep, so I'm going to bed. - Oh, well, let me know when you pencil in a time to talk about the fact that you used to be fun and used to do things like aggressive ballerina or collect Pokémon cards and how you've literally become one of those people who walk, talk, and act exactly the same. You know who you are? You're Captain Picard at the end of season four. You've assimilated into the Borg. You don't even realize it. - You're completely wrong as usual. - Oh, really? Please do enlighten me. - Captain Picard gets assimilated into the Borg at the end of season three. - God, do you have to be good at everything? You know what? You're not Captain Picard, okay? You're Data. You're a weird information robot. Why do I feel bad now? I'm the one who's doing something nice here. And we both know you wouldn't do the same for me. - Yeah... you're right. I probably wouldn't. - Soj. - Food? - Yes. I gotta use the puchpa'. - What's changed? - I just don't understand what is going on here. - I am being suffocated here. That's why. Between you and that kid and this house... - She's not "that kid." She's your daughter. - My life doesn't stop and start every time Bailey has some damn science fair or school play or whatever the hell... - Snack break time. I'm getting us some... - Hey, let's go ride our bikes. Let's go right now. - Ah! - Ah. - How did we miss that? Amazing. - Oh, no, it's 9:30. It's 9:30. We gotta go, okay? We should be in Texas by now. We gotta go. Oh, man. No, no Funyuns until we're on the road. Come on! - Come on, I'm eating breakfast. - Bailey! Come on, seriously, Bailey, we need to go now! We're, like, hours behind, okay? Come on! - Ow! Oh, stop, no! Oh, that's real cute, okay. - Now there's no breakfast for nobody, great. Let's ride or die, baby! Whoo! - Moo! Whoo, whoo! - Oh, come on! Yes. - Kelly, really? - I didn't say you had to turn it off. - What? No, no, it's fine. - You can turn the music back on if you want. - No, no, no, I'm good. - What are you doing? Whoa. - Whoo! What the heck? - What is happening? Why did you just do that? - Um, I'm hungry. We should eat. - Okay. Why are we parking way back here? - Uh, this car is a hot commodity, man. These small towns are, like, notorious for theft. - They are? - Uh, oh yeah, huge problem. If you took your head out of your book every now and then, maybe you'd know stuff like that... you know, learn some street smarts. - Hey, street smarts, your wallet's dangling out of your backpack. - Huh? Wait, wait... - You attract a lot of male attention. - Thank you. - Here we go. - That's quite some car you ladies rolled up in. What kind of trouble y'all getting into this evening? - Dude, mind your business. - Whoa, whoa, easy. I'm just trying to be welcoming. I'm Jarrod. So where you headed? - Um, Albuquerque. - Can I come? - Uh, table for two, please? - Anywhere you want. This isn't Applebee's. - Ah, just some unsolicited advice... If you're gonna shoot your shot, I recommend zipping up your fly first. - What can I get you girls? - Can I get the spaghetti and meatballs please? - May I please have the burger, but instead of fries, can I just get a side salad, please? - We don't really have a side salad. It's just gonna be more of the same lettuce. - Okay, just the burger then is fine. Actually, can I get some fries please? Thank you. - I don't know why you're so judgy. I'm just trying to save funds. Speaking of, where we at, Donna from accounting? - I actually really appreciate you taking an interest. - Of course you do. - Um, okay, so I have $500 set aside for the procedure. That leaves $450 for gas, $200 for emergency fund, and we have exactly $112 left over for food. - Maybe we do a little pre-appointment brunch, huh? Speaking of, when is your appointment tomorrow? Veronica, you do have an appointment for tomorrow, right? - Huh? Um, oh, well, they take walk-ins, so it's fine. - Oh, V. - What? - Come on. - What? I... I tried calling, but every time they answered, I just got freaked out and hung up, so... - Wow, got it, okay. - I know, I know. It's stupid. - Son of a bitch. - Okay, well, it's not that bad. Okay, what's happening? - Nothing, it's fine. Here, try some lemonade. - No, why are those cops looking at the car? - Um, like... like, cool thing I forgot to mention is that, um... that's my mom's asshole boyfriend's car, and I didn't exactly formally ask him if I could borrow it, so he may be, like, looking for it. - We're driving a stolen car? - Shut up, shut up. - My gosh. - Is it stolen if you know the person? The rules are very fake. - They are not. If the owner did not let you drive it, then it is stolen. - Okay, we gotta go. We gotta bail. - I don't... I don't think we can bail. What do we do? What do we do? - Excuse me. - What? - I wanna ask you... - Can you say something helpful please? - I don't know. I'm really sorry. - Excuse me... - Get down. You think that's funny, huh? - Got a great singer right here! - Oh, shoot. My backpack was in that car. I... why'd you lie about this? - I know. - I can't believe you did that. - I know... I ruined everything. I jeopardized this whole thing. I swear, Veronica, if I make you miss your appointment... I screwed up again. - Okay, it's okay. Calm down. We can... we can do this. We can figure this out. - No, I should never have said yes. Obviously I cannot be relied on for literally anything, and we're gonna go to jail. Look, I need... I need to go back. I need to explain the situation. Maybe I can avoid getting you arrested, yeah. - What? No... no, no, no. Don't leave me out here, okay? I'm gonna get murdered if I try to travel alone. Bailey, Bailey, I need you. - Nobody needs me. - No, I do. I need you. I really do. Wait! Wait, let me just show you one thing. - Veronica, I'm done. - Let me just... let me just show you this one thing, and when I show it to you, if you laugh, then you have to stay with me. - What are you talking about? - Okay, just watch. - Wow, aggressive ballerina, huh? - Veronica, this isn't fair. Come on. Okay, fine, fine, fine, I'll go with you. Fine, stop please. Please, it's... no, no, really. Really, stop. Veronica, stop... oh. Hey. It's you again. - When I asked what kind of trouble y'all was getting into, I thought I was just being cute. - Yeah, thanks for saving us back there. That was nice. Actually, uh, maybe you could... Could you drive us to the closest bus station? - Ah, we already running kind of late to our buddy's thing at the fairgrounds. I mean, closest stop is probably Amarillo. - Doesn't Matthews live in Amarillo? - That's true. Hop on in. We'll take you as far as the fairgrounds, and maybe you can scam a ride off our friend once you get there. - Um, I don't know if we have time for that. - Well, either way, we got about two minutes 'fore the cops pull up, so... - Let's do this! All right, come on, let's go! - Ooh, here we go! 96 trying to double that lead with number 12 in second. - Whoo! Oh, my God! Looks like 23's losing control! Oh, why? Into the wall. 23 is out for the count. - Let's go, Matthews! There go your ride right there. Cerveza? - I don't drink. - Ah, you know, I thought you might say that. - Thank you. - What a race! - Let's go, Matthews! Hey, don't die, dude! You still owe me 20 bucks. - This is it! The final lap! - This is so tight! - It's pretty cool. - Let's go! - In the lead after dominating all night, but wait, no, 96... Here it comes around the outside! Oh, yes! 96 takes it! - Let's go, Matthews! - Can't believe you know this guy. - Matthews? - 'Sup, dude? - The star! - Whoo! - You, that was crazy. - Wow, hi, wow. - Oh, this is Bailey, Veronica. They're two criminals we picked up at the diner after the car they stole got repoed by the cops. - Hey, I'm Kira. Is that real? - Yeah, kind of. - No, no, not at all. We're not criminals in the slightest. It was really a misunderstanding, and we actually really have to get back on the road. - Where are you headed? - Albuquerque. - So are y'all walking to New Mexico or... What? No, can't walk to New Mexico. What? - Um, yeah, we're trying to get to the bus station in Amarillo, and they said that you might be headed there. - I generally try not to associate with fugitives, but sure. What the hell? - Oh, thank you, wow. - Right on... I gotta go drive a monster truck over a pile of flaming Priuses. Meet me at the funhouse in 45? - That'll be fun. You know, funhouse. - J, you wanna help me gas up? - Sure. - Thanks, see you. - Bye. - Well... It was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you two on "America's Most Wanted." - Not unless we see you first on "American Idol." 'Cause the singing. Bye. Hello? - Oh. - Can I ask you something? - Mmm, this Twinkie is so great. - Hold on, hold on. We didn't get to finish our discussion. Okay, did you really not make an appointment for tomorrow? Oh, my God, Veronica, this is insane. You have this whole trip scheduled down to an inch of its life, yet no appointment. - What are you doing? What? No, no, no, no, no. - Stop, stop. - Bailey, please don't. Bailey, Bailey... - Hello, hi. Yes, this is Veronica Clarke, and I'm in need of... I'm in need of an abortion tomorrow please. Yes, I have taken a pregnancy test, and it's positive. About seven, eight weeks. I'm not sure. It's pretty early. - What? What are they saying? What are they saying? - Oh. - What are they saying? - Oh, I'm eligible for a pill instead of surgical. Oh, I'd need to come back for a follow-up? Dang, nope, can't make two separate appointments, so I guess surgical it is. Yes, I do have someone coming with me to my appointment actually. She's amazing, and actually super smart but doesn't brag about it. Just, like, this majestic human... Yes, ma'am, sorry, sorry. Okay, what's the earliest I can get? 8:00 a.m.? - Um... yes, yes, that's perfect. - Okay, I'll take it. Okay, thanks. You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Today was nuts, and I kind of... I don't know. Just the call made it real. My heart's racing. - Yeah, my heart's racing too, but I think it's from the deep fried Twinkie. Also it's not that crazy. Like, one in four women get them. - Yeah, no, I know. Just it's a surgery at a clinic with doctors. It's a whole thing. Anyways... is there something else you maybe wanna talk about... That whole Kira thing? - Oh, look, a ride. Let's do it, come on. - Wait, Bailey. It seems like maybe you like... the Slinger, but you're just nervous about it? - I'm not nervous about the Slinger. I just don't wanna talk about it. - But you do like the Slinger? - Oh, my God, Veronica, yes, I like girls, okay? Is that a problem? - No, no, not at all. That's... it's great. I just... I didn't know. - There's a lot of things you don't know. - I mean, I'm honored to be the first person that you, like, came out to. Bitch, what? I've been out to my mom for, like, years. Like, five of my cousins, my entire "X-Files" fan forum, Doug from the bank. - Okay, okay, I get it. - Does your dad know? - Oh, um, we haven't really been keeping in touch much lately. It's not really his fault. He's just really busy with his plant store stuff. - How long have you known? - Since Tammy Clannahan and her shiny hair in fifth grade, I guess. - Tammy clammy hands? Why wouldn't you have told me that? - Do you want everyone in town to know you're pregnant? - No, but I think... - No, same thing. Church, gossip, it's a shit show, and I don't really wanna be a part of it. Oh! Oh, my God! - I like girls! - Yeah, you do! - Yes, I like girls! - Whoo, man! Oh! - The first time I masturbated was to Emma Watson in "Deathly Hallows"! - Part one or part two? - Part one, obviously! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, man, oh! - I'm pregnant! - Hell yeah! - Yeah, I'm pregnant, and I'm getting an abortion! Yes! We're gay and pregnant! - We are gay, and we are pregnant! - We're gay and pregnant! - Okay, there's a bus that leaves in an hour, which will get us into Albuquerque at 9:00. How are we gonna get there by 8:00? - Hey, there. Sorry to interrupt, but we couldn't help but overhear. Are y'all looking for a ride down to New Mexico? - We're headed to Albuquerque. - Um... Yes, yes, actually, we are. Hi, I'm Veronica. This is Bailey. Our car just broke down, and we've really been scrambling to get our butts there. - Wait, you guys are headed to Albuquerque? - Yep, we are going to see my mother... - That's right. - But when we saw this carnival, we just had to stop. - I mean, we wouldn't wanna be, like, a burden to you guys or anything. We don't have money really. - Oh, no, no, no, hush, please... If one of our daughters was stranded, we hope someone would do the same thing. - Yes. - Just hope you guys are okay with this one singing Peter, Paul, and Mary the whole darn trip. - Wow, you guys are a godsend. - Oh. - Hey, guys. Truck's out back. - Um, hey, we actually won't be needing that ride anymore. - Yeah, found people to take us the whole way there. - Oh. - So we'll bring the car around front and meet you in 15? - Great, thank you, guys. You're amazing. Thank you. - Thanks. - Bye. - I'm gonna go pee. You know, long ride and everything. - You wanna go check out the funhouse before you gotta go? - Oh, yeah, I'll do that, yeah. It was nice meeting you. - I meant with me, you weirdo. - Oh, my God, I'm stuck. Oh, oh. Um... - Would it be okay if I kissed you? - Well, I just... - I'm sorry. No, it's... we don't have to. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm just warning you that I might be, like, kind of bad at it. I've never really done it before. - That's okay. - Thank you guys again so much for the ride. - Oh, of course, honey. We're so happy to help. So what's got you two headed to Albuquerque anyway? - Um... - My dad lives there. - Oh, you must be excited to see him. Wait, for real? Are we not taking the I-40 the whole way there? According to the maps, it says... Shoot, my phone's about to die. - The 40 gets crazy toward Amarillo, so just taking a shortcut. - Here, I can charge your phone up here. - Okay, thank you. - Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, wake up. - Where are we? - Dude, I gotta piss so bad, I can almost taste it. Where the hell are we? - Maybe we're just outside of Albuquerque, and this is their stop? - You're going in there? - Yeah. I mean, they're nice people, and we gotta get back on the road, so... - All right, well, looks like the house from the Conjure-verse, but all right. Hello? Hello? - Beauties, ain't they? - Oh! - Oh, shit! Oh, oh. - Hi. - Paul, Joseph, Sarah, Rebecca, Mark Junior, and Mary. - Don't let him fool you girls. When they were younger, he needed a cheat sheet to keep 'em all straight. - Of course, the doctor told us Joseph would be our last one, but then, just when we got the last one out of the house, he delivered our final miracle. - Yep, shows you what the doctors know. - That's right. - I'm sorry, but where are we? - This is our home. Oh, we tried to tell you, but you were fast asleep. I hope you don't mind. It was on the way, so we figured we'd stop and have some breakfast. - That's really sweet of you guys. Thank you, but we really don't have much time, so... - I hope you like pancakes. - Let's join hands. Lord, thank you for this bountiful meal we're about to receive, and thank you for our new, special friends. We appreciate your guidance and thank you for entrusting us to spread your word. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Oh, man. - So, girls... - Actually... I'm sorry... I need to use the restroom. - Oh, top of the stairs, first door on the left. - Thanks. - You bet. Mother, you have outdone yourself with these flapjacks. - Oh. Can you believe it? I forgot the coffee. Mark, can you be a dear and put the kettle on? Orange juice, Veronica? - Um, no thanks. - Awfully kind of you to accompany your friend all the way to New Mexico. It's a big hike from Missouri. - Yeah, I know, but she would do the same for me. - Oh. - Sorry, I don't remember telling you we were from Missouri. - Oh. I should be honest. I have a bit of a confession to make. You see, at the carnival, Mark and I, we couldn't help but overhearing your friend making you that appointment. Now, there's no need for alarm. It's just we were so overjoyed when we heard that God had given you this miracle of life. - You know, I think it's kind of that time where we should get back on the road, so would you mind giving me my phone back, please? - What are you hoping for? Boy or a girl? - Neither. - Okay, but if you had to pick. - I don't know... girl, I guess, but thank you for charging... - Oh, a little girl. Oh, I just think that you and Kevin... That you would be such wonderful parents. - Did you just say "Kevin"? - Your loving boyfriend. He called while you were napping. Hello, Bailey. - No... Mark! - We need to get out of here! - I'm aware! - Wait. Wait! - Are they already speaking in tongues? Oh, my God. - Oh, catch. - Got it. - Don't you start that vehicle! - Eat me, straight lady! What the hell is that? - Drive! Oh, my God, oh. - Girls, why don't we pull over and we'll talk about it in the crisis pregnancy center. We just like to help women make smart, educated decisions. - This is why you always choose the ride from the hot lesbian! - Oh, man. Oh! - Sorry. - Oh, my gosh, a fence! There's a fence! - We just wanted to give you some medical advice. Did you know that having an abortion could result in you not being able to get pregnant in the future? - That's not true! I Googled it! And, frankly, that's a very problematic falsehood to be spreading! - Dead cows? Gross. - I don't like it. I don't like it. - Gross. - Oh, my gosh! - Here we go! No. - Huh. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - I think we lost him. That was incredible! - I'm like Vin Diesel behind the wheel. - That's Kevin's favorite actor. Oh, gosh. Oh, what do we do? Um... We have to do something. - Let's keep going. - What? - I'm kidding! I'm doing a "Thelma and Louise" thing. We're not driving off a cliff. But maybe... maybe he doesn't have to know that. - Oh. - Oh... oh, come here! - Oh, okay, okay, okay. - What do we do? - Wait. - Oh, darn it. Darn it, darn it, darn it! Honey, there's been an accident. I don't... uh, girls? You all right? I don't know. I gotta check. I'll call you. - All right, let's go. - Guys, I think this was a misunderstanding, you know? Look, we both said some things, okay? - We're dying. I need food. I need water. - I haven't posted in, like, ten hours. - That's what you're worried about? We're gonna starve out here, Veronica. I'd take one of those pancakes from Karen and Mike Pence at this point. - Ugh, she didn't even charge my freaking phone. - Still got some juice. No reception though. Could really use one of those printed maps right now. When I'm wrong, I'm wrong. - Wait, we can... - Whoa, whoa, that's it! We just hop the train like old-timey hobos! - Yes, okay, let's go. - Yes! - Are you allowed to say hobo? - It did feel weird when I said it! - Okay, here's the plan! Jump, grab on, hold tight! - Got it! - We jump on three! - Okay. - All right, okay. One... Two... Three! - Trains go fast. - This is a joke. This is a joke. I shouldn't be here. I should not be here! I should be able to just walk down the street and open a door and waltz right in and say, "Hello, my name is Veronica. "My boyfriend is an asshole. Here's my $500. "Oh, oh, yes, I would love a cup of water. "Thank you so much. That's so sweet of you." But no. Nope! Instead I literally had to drive 996 miles, and now I'm stranded in this freaking field in the middle of nowhere, and the train... The stupid train won't slow down! Why in the hell do you need to get parental consent to have an abortion, but not to actually birth a human child? Ugh! Fuck you, Missouri State Legislature! - Veronica. - What? - There's a bus stop in that town with our name on it. - Oh. Well, we're 3 1/2 hours away, and your appointment's in 30 minutes. And my phone died. Not great. - Hello. Hello? - Bailey, come here! Hello? Mitch, we need a limo! - Dude, it's closed. Come on. - There's someone in there. Mitch! Oh. - Who sent you? - Um, I'm sorry to bother you, but we really need to get to Albuquerque. - All right, come on in. Come on. Come on. - Um... - What's in Albuquerque? - Actually, it's kind of a personal thing. - Tell me why you came here. - She needs an abortion. - Where'd you say you come from? - Missouri. The law there won't let me get one without my parents knowing, so we had to go all the way to New Mexico. - Ha! Big government thinking they can tell people what they can and cannot do with their bodies. It makes me sick. They want us to suckle at their teat, drink their fluoride water, and brush our teeth every day like little cogs in their machine. - Do you not brush... - How much money you got? - Uh, we can pay you... $600. - I'll pull a limo around. - Ah, yes, thank you, Mitch. - Mitch is a decoy. Name is Bob. - Oh. - Oh, my gosh. Is that the first limo ever made? - Wow. - You know, some people take a limo to prom. We take it to an abortion. - Well, I took a limo to prom too. Okay, so when I called the clinic, they only had two appointments left... A 10:00 a.m. and a 1:00 p.m. Obviously we have to make the 10:00 a.m. or we won't make it home in time, and my parents will find out, which would suck. - Aw, you called all by yourself? My little V's growing up. - Stop! - Whoo! - Whoo! - You know what? - Yeah! - Wait! Wait, stop! Wait. - New Mexico! Whoo, whoo! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, guys. - Stop studying and come over. - Yeah, come over. Kaylee finally solved the mystery. - Wh-what? - Okay, hear me out. It's Bailey Butler. - Isn't that crazy? - You know, it's gotta be. Everyone else denied it, and someone saw her by the dumpster. Plus it's always the loners who are secretly having tons of freaky sex with other weirdos. - What do you think, Ronnie? You know her best out of anyone. - I-I don't know her that well. I don't know why you guys keep saying that. - Everything okay? You sound weird. - Do you think it was her? - What do you think, Ronnie? - Come on, is it her? - Yeah, yeah, probably you guys are right. I mean, she seems lonely so maybe she's, like, hooking up with random people. Who knows. - Oh, my God, that's so sad. - Yeah, I actually... I have to go, but I'll talk to you guys soon, okay? - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Wow. I'm so stupid. - Bailey. I just... you know I had to say something. - Bob, pull over! - What was I supposed to say? Bailey... Bailey, come on. Come on, we're in the middle of nowhere. Can you just talk to me please? It was just a stupid phone call. - Clearly you were bullshitting me this whole time! - No, I was covering. If anything, I was bullshitting them. - Oh, well, if that's true, that's even worse. You like me, and you still sell me out? You don't even defend me? You would do literally anything to just maintain this fake, perfect image of yourself you created. - That's... - You used me for a ride, and then you talk trash about me. You lie to your own best friends about your abortion? - It's complicated. - Why can't you just tell them, huh, if you guys are such besties? - Look, I'm not, like, the type of person that's just supposed to go and get an abortion. Veronica, you are exactly the kind of person who gets an abortion and then doesn't tell anyone. The same kind of person who would just drop their best friend on a dime. - Do you know why? Did you ever think about why? - Yeah, yeah, you know, I had a lot of time to think about it when I was sitting in the lunchroom alone every day. - You know, you made it so hard to be your friend. You... you just wanted to get in trouble, and then you'd make fun of me because I didn't, and you made me feel like a loser for caring about school, and it was like you were... you were mad at me for doing well and being happy. I don't know. It was... God, and then, remember when I invited you to my 14th birthday, and you snuck in a bottle of amaretto and puked all over my birthday cake? - No one likes carrot cake. - I do. You... you changed, Bailey. - Yeah, because my parents were getting a divorce. I'm so sorry that I couldn't be happy and perfect for you all the time. - I never needed you to be perfect. Just, like, normal. - Veronica, you know what? Go back to your car. Go to your appointment. Stick to your beloved plan. - Please don't do this. Bailey... You know that I need someone there with me at the clinic. - Someone? - Okay... - Are you serious right now? - That's not what I meant. - That is exactly what you meant. - No, it isn't. - I am only here because you need "someone." Well, Bob... Bob is someone, right? So why don't you just go with him? You know what, Veronica? You have a super fun abortion. Snap a pic for the gram. - Screw you! Okay, Bob, let's get out of here. - Ain't nothing to worry about. - How long is this gonna take? - Two clicks past 0800 hours. 20, 30 minutes. - Ugh! Bob, can we just make a quick stop? - Hey, what's up with that drink? - Oh, yeah, I know it's weird, but, surprisingly, it's really good. - No, I know. Another girl came in, and she made me try hers. - She got this exact same drink? - Yeah, exact same. - The half blue raspberry, half cherry with a squirt of coke? - And a squirt of coke. Yeah, yeah, what... is it like a meme or a challenge or something? - Um, uh... - Bob, Bob, she came! She came. She's here. She's here somewhere. Wait, but if she came for me, then why wouldn't she have called me? - Why else would she be here? - We gotta go, Bob. Oh, I found it. Okay, in 2.3 miles, you're gonna make a left. - Yeah, but if we go, you're gonna miss your ten hundred. I mean your 10:00 a.m. appointment. - It's okay. - Look, she seems like a tough kid. I'm sure whatever it is, she'll be fine. - That's a pretty plant. Are you gonna help your mom plant it? Yeah? Well, thank you so much. Have a nice day. - Welcome to Butler's. May I help you? Bailey. - Hey, Dad. - What are you doing here? - I don't know. Just passing through. Thought I'd, uh, come say hi. I thought since I'm here, we could, like, go get dinner or something. - I wish you had called ahead. I'm a little busy right now. - Yeah, no, yeah, you're right. I should have called. I don't know. I just thought... - Always were too impulsive. - Yeah, right, like, crazy Bailey? What's she gonna do next, you know? Oh, a rock, ooh, ha, ha. Ah, whoa. - Do you need money? Is that why you're here? I've sending your mother checks when I can, but it's slow time of the year, and I'm just trying to make ends meet as it is. - No, no, Dad, that... Look, I'm sorry. I should have called. You're right, and I'm... - Give your old man a heads up next time, will you? - Right, right, yeah. See you, I guess. - Are... are you kidding me? - What the hell are you doing here? - Veronica Clarke? - I'm sorry, I just... She drove hundreds of miles to see you, and you won't even go to dinner with her? - Please don't do this. - You think that being a father is just sending a few checks a year, and that's that? - I don't need to explain myself to you. I never expected any father of the year awards. Your mother wanted kids, and I wanted to be with your mother. Seemed like a fine trade-off when the relationship was going all right, but as that faded, what was I left with? - What were you left with? Do you... do you know anything about this person right here? Do you know that she speaks three different languages and somehow knows the lyrics to every single song ever made? And she is fearless. You're fearless... especially behind the wheel of a GMC Yukon. You're not just missing out on knowing your daughter. You're missing out on knowing one of the most unique, passionate, incredible human beings on the face of the planet... - All right, that's enough. You're both young. When you grow up a little, you'll realize that you don't always get what you want in life. I think you should go. - What are you doing? Oh... - Oh! - Oh! - Okay, we gotta go! We gotta go! We got to go right now! - I didn't kill him! I didn't kill him... did I? Did I? - You're a freak. Who does that? What, what, what? - Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Not just for the fight today but for the last four years. I-I never thought about it from your perspective, and I don't know how I'm gonna make it up to you. - Well, tasing my dad was a good start. Whoa, what about your appointment? Whoa, whoa, whoa, no! - I had to come find you, so I'm taking the later one. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You chose me over risking your parents finding out? You goddamn idiot, that is so nice! Okay, let's go! Let's go! - Do not tase them, okay? I know that's your instinct right now, but it's just not a great idea. - Girls... If friendship weren't a construct designed to tie one down, well, then I'd say you two would make awfully fine friends. - Thanks for everything, Bob. - No, thank you, Victoria. Oh, Veronica. Are you serious? - Okay, I thought it was too late. I really need to talk to you. - No, mm-mm. - I got this. - Okay, I'm gonna go sign you in. - How... how did you even know that I was here? - That Kate lady that you stayed with in Texas, she told me... Seems super dope, a little intense. I thought you two were gonna be here, like, hours ago. - Yeah, well, it's been a long trip. You do know that you can't stop me from doing this. - No, listen, I know, and you're right. Okay, this isn't about me wanting a baby. I want you, okay? I still wanna be with you even though you're doing this. - I appreciate that. I do. But right now, I would just prefer it if you weren't here. - Are you kidding me? I was just, like, so nice. - Excuse me? - Well, what do you want from me? You know, I said I'm sorry, like, five times already about the condom thing or whatever, okay? I'm here to comfort you in your time of need, and it's like you don't even realize I had, like, three other things going on this weekend. It's like you don't even wanna be with me at all. - You're totally right. - What? - I've been unsure for a long time, and that's unfair to you, and I'm sorry 'cause you've been a really fun boyfriend, but you are not the person that I wanna be with for the rest of my life. - I don't think you can hear yourself right now, but you sound crazy, okay? Maybe, like, the baby fluids are working their way up to your brain or something like that? Like, I don't know. I'm not a doctor. But what I do know is that this isn't really what you wanna do. - No, it is. It absolutely is. Come on... am I really the person... - Know what? Either we stay together, or I tell everybody at school about your top-secret abortion. - You know, go for it. I don't care. Fine, I will. You know what? It was gonna be a surprise, but my dad bought me a Jet Ski for graduation, and now you're never gonna step foot on it. - Wow. - Veronica Clarke? We actually can't have your friend back there. So sorry. - Oh, is... is that okay? - Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Here you go. What happens next? - You can relax. We're just gonna talk for a few minutes. - Okay. - I have a few questions, and then I'll walk you through the entire process. No surprises. First, is this your decision? Have you been coerced in any way? - No. I mean, yes, yes, this is my decision. I want to do this. - Okay, good. You have a choice between local anesthetic or sedation. Basically, during surgery you can be numb or awake or asleep. - I can be asleep? Then, yes, definitely... Definitely that option. - Okay, good. Final question. Do you have someone to take you home? - Yeah, my friend. - Okay, great, you're doing wonderful. So here's the plan. First you'll change into your gown. Warning... it's not cute. Then you'll get a vaginal ultrasound. It's not fun, but it doesn't hurt, and you don't have to look at the monitor if you don't want to. Next we'll draw some blood, and we'll hook you up to an IV. Then you'll sit with other women who are waiting for surgery. And then to the surgical suite. The anesthesiologist will place a mask on your face, and you'll be asleep in seconds. The doctor has a wand that he'll insert inside you and remove the fetus. You'll be in and out in under ten minutes. You'll wake up in the recovery room safe and sound. And that's it. - Can I tell you something? I'm honestly pretty nervous. - That's okay. It's normal. And I have a feeling you're gonna do just fine. - You're alive! Oh, they wouldn't let me see you, so I just assumed you were dead. - Aw. Nope, I'm fine. - How are you feeling? - Relieved. And hungry. - Food? Okay. - Mm-hmm, while I was out, I had them put in an IUD, so... - Oh, so our last abortion road trip, huh? - I know, bummer, right? So when are we gonna talk about the fact that we have, like, $20 and no way to get home? - Yeah, I know. I just have to make a quick phone call. - Yeah, I should probably make one myself. Mom? Hi. - I got Fil's car impounded. - I need your help. - Well, um, this is me. - Yeah, that is your house. Well... - Thank you for... coming and, you know, doing all that stuff. We don't have to, like, say a big good-bye or anything. I mean, school's tomorrow. I'll see you there, so... - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, no, I know. You're right. Okay, see you. - See ya. - Hey. Come sit. - I know you're mad. I can I just say something? I don't feel bad about the abortion. I feel like I'm supposed to, but I don't. I know I made the right choice for me. I just, I... I'm really scared that you're gonna hate me. - Hate you? Veronica... how could you even think that? No, I love you. But I'm not... gonna lie to you. The choice you made... that's not something I can just... It's not the choice I would've made, not the one your sister made. I'm not sure I'll ever understand it. I'm sorry. What I know is I love you, sweet pea. I love you so much more than all of that, okay? - Okay. - Ronnie, oh, my God. We heard about everything. - Oh, you must be devastated. - Surviving a break-up is brutal, but, like, you'll bounce back. - Yeah. - Oh, did you hear? Someone got busted with a locker full of Adderall. How aggressive is that? And you know, I've already looked into it, and I think that Connor is at the top of my list 'cause of all... - The pregnancy test was mine. - Wait, what? - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - I can't believe you've been dealing with this alone. - I haven't. - Hi. - Wait, where even are we? I thought we were supposed to be going to Gas N' Gulp. Oh, um, yeah. That's... that's not actually where we're going. - Then where are we going? - Well, remember when you said we could go to Roswell? - No. - Mm-hmm. - No, no... - Yeah!
