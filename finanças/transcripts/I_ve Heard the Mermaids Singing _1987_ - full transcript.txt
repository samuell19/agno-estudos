Hello, hello, hello. Testing. One, two, three. Hello. My name is Polly Vandersma and I'm a Girl Friday. Well, actually, I became a Person Friday a couple of years ago... didn't change the job very much. Anyways, it all started when the agency called me for another temp job. They don't call that often 'cause l... guess I'm not very good at it. One guy even said that I was... Oh, what did he say? He said that I was organizationally impaired. It looked like it was going to be kind of an interesting job... or at least, a lot more interesting than those accounting firms and that stupid toothpaste factory. My new boss was a curator. Bonjour. Have a seat. Bonjour. The thing that I'll always remember about her, was her voice. She had a French accent on everything she said. She would say to me, "Type this, Polly", only she'd say, "Type this, Polly", Like it just sounded just like poetry. Well, I mean not quite, but you know. But you know, the Curator was pretty amazing in general. She was so serious even when she laughed. I mean, I could tell right away that she was like those people you see in restaurant windows sometimes, and they are always talking and laughing and inter... you know... facing. And... Like a ping pong game. And I always loved that because... I guess I was never so terrific at talking and everything. Well, I'm not sure how long I'll be using you. Oh, that'll be just fine. Excuse me? I mean... for as however long you need me would be appropriate. Great. Well, I have a meeting right now. Why don't we call it a day and start tomorrow? - At nine. - Nine? Oh, nine would be tremendous. Uh... okay. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bonjour! Bonjour to you. Church Gallery, may I help you. I live by myself, I always have, ever since my parents died when I was 21. In the 10 years since then... I'm 31 now. I've had a couple of, you know, boyfriends... but... I could never really... talk to them about all the things I think about sometimes, and all the things I've seen. So I guess that makes me a spinster or something, and an unsuccessful career woman. But I'm pretty much a gal on the go. And I've always had this hobby and that keeps me pretty busy. I kind of get a kick out of taking pictures of things that I like, you know. Hi! Take your phone call, it's fine. Bye. Really, it's nothing. Holy molly! Oh, don't look at it, okay? It's not very good. "Thank you for the information on your line of surveillance systems. We would lick to confirm our agreement." Lick? That's lovely, Polly, but I don't think it'll be necessary. Blah, blah, blah... X79 wireless remote video camera, monitor, and playback... blah, blah, blah... Cost, blah, blah, blah... Expect... delivery in one geek. I guess I shouldn't laugh. Well, you know, typing isn't exactly my strong point. No, I guess not. I'm sure you have other talents. I learned a lot of things about the Curator. Well, sometimes we would just work. But she loved to talk to me and tell me things that had happened to her and what she said. Her parents bought her the gallery with money they made in chocolate, in the bittersweet market, in Switzerland since before the war. She was... she was like a fairytale. I mean, she went to school all over the world and talked to the kind of people who write books. I mean, she even wrote a book herself once. And she loved to talk about art things. Like whose work shows talent and whose doesn't, and whose work shows "acute awareness". At first I thought she meant like "a cute face", "a cute awareness". And... whose work came from "half-lives, half-lived." Isn't that great? Half-lives, half-lived. I mean... that's terrible but you know what I mean. Oh, I just loved how she talked, I wanted her to teach me everything. Too bad it all went so wrong. Attach to the camera the motor generator board and mount the cover... I think it's already put together. I think they did it for us, it's fine. Well, let's do it then. I'll go check it. - It works. - Good. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. That's okay. I love it here, I come here all the time. It's really nice. - Oh, it feels so good! - Yeah. Hot. So, Polly, there's something I'd like to speak to you about. Go ahead. When I called the Person Friday Agency, they warned me about your past performance. Can I take your order? Yes, I'll have some Sake. Gozaimashita Sake. Oh, I'll just have some milk. Cow's milk. And, uh, I'd like to order now. I'll have number 12 please. I think I'll just have... number 13. Thank you. Please. They said a couple of previous employers had mentioned your... distractedness. Oh, really? Well, you know, I can work on it. The first step in solving a problem is recognizing it. Yes, I believe that. Thank you. So, Polly, what are your plans? For what? Well, for your future, your career. Oh! I don't have any. Wouldn't you like to have... a full-time job instead of temporary work all the time, no? No. Well, what do you want then? A fork. I mean from life, Polly. I'm sorry. Well, I haven't really decided yet. I used to want to be a dancer, a singer or something, but, uh... Well, I really like being a temporary secretary for you. So what do you want from life? Oh. Most things, I guess. Universal respect, eternal youth, passion that never fades. The regular, you know. I guess I'd like never to get neurotic about growing old and someday, make something breathtakingly beautiful that lasts forever and all time. And, Polly, I like having you around. I can concentrate with you there. I'd like you to be my permanent part-time secretary. What do you think? I would love to be your secretary. Cheers! Oh!! - Hi, can I help you? - Yeah. Is Gabrielle in? Who is it? That's okay. You moved here? Why? I like Toronto. I want to work here. There are some fascinating people here. And you're among them. Well... welcome. I thought you might have some work for me. Some secretarial shit, or something. You're too talented for that. Besides, I just hired somebody. And, Mary, I'm not sure it's a good idea for me to see you a lot. Are you seeing someone? I've been seeing this guy for a while. Fun? Yes, for a while. Very gifted but then... he suddenly lost it, and seems to blame me for it. I guess nothing lasts forever. - You talent fucker. - Thanks, dear. So why don't you want to see me? Afraid you'll be accused of being a "lesbyterian"? In my line of work, I come into contact with a lot of... Baptist ministers who would really give me a hard time. You know that's not the point. I'm too old for you. I'm wise beyond my years. And I'm foolish beyond mine. No. I guess it was all a little too delirious before. You prefer a tepid romance? I'm getting a lot more done now. - Sublimation! - Productivity. I miss making love with you. Mary, don't. I'm at a critical, very critical point, right now. I can't lose focus. I'm not blaming you but none of it seemed as important when I was with you. Sorry, Gabrielle. I understand. I do. I just think everybody needs someone, especially if they're as insanely ambitious as you are. I think I kind of fell in love with the Curator. I know that love is a pretty strong word when you're talking about another woman and she's not your mother, but there you go. I... I don't think I wanted kissing and all that stuff. I just, I just loved her. I guess I'll be leaving for the day. Yeah, sure. Have fun. Yeah. Gosh, you know, sometimes I think my head is like a gas tank, you have to be really careful what you put into it 'cause it might just affect the whole system. Isn't life the strangest thing you've ever seen? I know, Clive. His work is sometimes thematically unresolved, but... there's no question his boyish bravado has a certain charm. But charm isn't enough, Gabrielle. His technique isn't nearly as muscular as his imagery. Oh, you're not looking beyond the realist camouflage. Look at this one. Now it is true that he is somewhat incapacitated by his emotions, but there is blood in there, Clive. Blood. Oh yes! New York is wild for his oblique pragmatism. - New York? - Yes. Well, look at this. No flabby euphemisms here. Here for example. The static structure is offset by his whimsical sociological references. Even a classical reference or two. I am certain he's going to be a terribly important artist, Clive, internationally. There is a hopefulness in his contextural destruction... No question. ...and the lack of resolution of his themes almost adds to a vaguely literal internal transformation of his subject. - It's an external transformation. - Internal. - External - look at the lemon! - What about the fork? - Oh, the fork is irrelevant. - You might be right. - I guess there is a face. - Exactly. - Yes, you're right. - Yes. The face does it. Well, Gabrielle, I'll talk to the committee at the National Institute. I think it's a wise decision, Clive. No, no, no, no, no... I think a relativist mentality would resolve a lot of conflicts, politically, aesthetically, religiously and even in terms of relationships. If everyone believed that there was no "right" way, that no human being has a direct communication, if you will, with the omnipotent, then the world would be a much kinder place. Well, how does this relativism relate to relationships? Interesting question. I believe that gender is irrelevant in matters of the heart. Desire follows the heart. Freud had an interesting theory, one of the few to which I ascribe. Ironically, he called it "polymorphous perversity", the idea being that all children are born in a state of being open to any sexual or affectional preference and that society pushes us one way or another. Whereas he called this "perversity", I maintain that it is a most natural state; a state we must actively cultivate. Polly, you sound so... Intelligent and enlightened?! Well it is, after all, my vision. Good morning, Church Gallery. May I help you? Ah yes. Just a minute please. It's for you. Hello? Yes, Carl. Yes, yes. Another one. It's on Sunday. I'm having a little soiree and you're more than welcome. Bring a friend if you'd like. Nineish. Yes. See you then. Bye. People insist on reminding me. Of what? That I'm dying. Polly, I'd like you to... call the people that have a mark here beside their names... - When? - Anytime. This afternoon. Tomorrow. It's okay. I'm not in that much of a hurry. - But what's the matter with you? - Nothing. Why are you dying? Pauvre enfant, I'm not dying. It's just a figure of speech. I meant it's my birthday. I'm just getting older, you know. We're all dying all the time, that sort of thing, that's all. Oh, Polly. I'd love you to come to my party. Oh. - Oh well, hello, Polly. - Hi. Glad you could drop in. - Can I help you. - Oh, sure. I'll just get the door. Well, everyone's left already... Almost everyone. I'm really sorry I'm late. I had a little trouble finding your place. Don't worry about it, it's nothing really. You can open it later. Thank you. It's very... - big. - Yeah. Well, let's sit down. Okay. - Hello. - Hello, Mary. Uh, this is... Mary. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - Can I get you a drink, Polly? - Oh, yes please. What would you like? I think I'll have a rum. - Straight up? - Oh, whenever. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, cheers. - Well, I guess... - Do you... - I'm sorry, go ahead. - No, it's okay. I was going to say, I guess you had a lot of people here tonight. - Yeah. - Sorry I'm late. Well, girls, I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Mary. Bonsoir, Mary. Don't stay up too late. Happy birthday. Thank you. Why are you so sad? Why? Good question. I'm so lucky, you know. I have enough friends, enough money. I have this gallery thing happening and I have a lover who loves me. Wanting more is greed, isn't it? Actually, you're the one who's lucky. Why? You don't need any more than you have, do you? You're contented with the fact that you'll never be... the best Person Friday in the history of Western Civilization, aren't you? I've never really thought about that but... Oh God, to have such simple needs. I don't mean to be patronizing. Do you know what it's like... to want one thing all your life and know all your life that you'll never have it? What thing? Oh, it's stupid. Don't ask. Talent, Polly. A simple gift. I don't want to die with my body. Whose body do... To make something beautiful is to be beautiful forever, isn't it? Wouldn't you like that? Yes. God, I get pompous when I'm drunk! Here, let me help you. What do you want to make that's so beautiful? One painting, this big... that's good. Undeniably, unequivocally, universally good. A painting? I hate resenting someone else's talents. You paint? Can I tell you something? Sure. I submitted some work to an adult class, a painting class. Just a stupid little course full of housewives doing landscapes. You know, the sort of situation where I wouldn't have to feel embarrassed. - And you know what? - What? Last week they rejected me. They called my stuff "simple-minded". But if you get a kick out of it... Oh, yes! I get a big kick out of it... in the stomach! Could I ask you something? Anything? Could I please see your painting? See, it's true. You don't want much, do you? Please. - Oh, Polly. - Please. Well... why not? I'm drunker than l... I thought. You made these? No, Polly, I stole them. They're so... they're so... nice! I just couldn't believe how shy she was about her golden paintings. I mean, they were so, so beautiful. I mean, I don't know very much about art things, but I thought they were the most tremendous things in the whole world. I didn't even have to pretend to like them. They were like real magic. So I had this idea that I'd send her my pictures under a pseudo-name. I just thought she'd kind of like them. - Well? - Well what? Well, what do you think? Oh, mon dieu, how... that's not... Polly, no! You shouldn't be so modest. I'm not the only one who loves it. What do you mean? Carl dropped by here yesterday, when you were sick, to talk to you about your article for the magazine... He saw it? Oh, my God! What did he say? He didn't know what to say, he loved it so much he was speechless. Yeah, sure. Oh, Polly. What's his number? 461-8874. Polly, Polly, Polly... Hi Carl, it's me. Listen, I hear you saw a painting here yesterday. Well, you weren't supposed to. Well, it isn't ready... Carl, now don't overstate the case, you'll lose credibility. What!? When? Hold on! When is it going to press? Carl, you can't write a review of just one painting, there's no context... What did you write? No, you, you can't see more. There is no more to see. Just leave it alone, all right? Bye. "This single piece attests to the birth of a master talent. It's exquisitely wrought equal-li-brium of equivalent opposites maintains an organic integrity of trans-luck-ant... - Translucent. - ...structural elements. It's vibrant tonality is counterbalanced by a rigorous but subdued rationality." "As in all her greatest writing... one feels here a fusion of the real with the visionary, and this one painting, through it's inner glow and deep harmonies, comes closer to the effect of music than any painting this critic has ever seen, felt or heard." - Another good one. - Polly, can you get the mail? Sure. Yes. Yes, I know. Thank you, Polly. The Times is sending someone tomorrow... It's big, Mary. I don't know if I'm up to it. I'm not sure about this whole idea. Well... Okay, I'll meet you there. Bye. Polly. Send a note to little, uh... Penelope here. You know, a thank-you-but-no-thank-you letter. Be nice but don't encourage her. She just doesn't have it. God, look at this! The trite made flesh! Polly, did you hear me? Yes, I did. They show some potential though, don't you think? No. It's not going anywhere. It's completely simple-minded. I'm not here. I'll be painting and I can't be reached. All right? That's just fine. Hello, this is Polly. I can't come in today. Yeah, I'm sick. I don't know, I'm just sick. Yeah, I will. Okay. Bye. I wasn't really sick, except... except for my heart. You know, how it can feel, uh... sort of all red and swollen especially late at night? Do you know what I mean? You don't care how I felt. You just want to know what happens, don't you? Hi, Polly. Gabrielle out? No, she's hiding under her desk. - Aren't we cheerful today? - Yup. What's this? The trite made flesh. - That's a little harsh, isn't it? - It's no good. Polly, why do you have to judge it? Can't you just like it or not like it and leave it at that? It doesn't matter if I like it or not, it's still no good. Well, what's good? What if it's a shot of someone this photographer just loves to distraction. Isn't that a good thing? Like how you love the Curator? The Cur... Oh, Gabrielle! Yeah, I love her... a lot. Like a mother or a sister? No. Like a lover. Sorry, Mary, just came back from Lingaard's place. Oh, that pompous ass. Well, he can be as pompous as he wants if he actually buys five more paintings - sight unseen. Hello, Polly. Feeling better? Polly, a guy named Warren Gersh is coming in, tell him I'm at an interview or something... Hello, Gabrielle. Charming outfit. Must you always comment on appearances, Warren? Hello, Gabrielle. My you have a lovely soul today. Hi, I'm Mary Joseph. Don't mind her, you know these temperamental artistes. Hello, Mary. And, Polly, this is Warren. Polly. Hello, Polly. So aren't you the hot property these days. The hidden talent behind the fortress. Yeah, well... I just thought I'd drop by and see this divine gift that you've bestowed on we, mere mortals and to congratulate you, of course. You must be thrilled. Yeah, well. It's all a little unexpected. Careful, the higher you fly the harder you fall. Thanks for the encouragement. The woman who lived a charmed life. May I please say something? Of course, Polly, go ahead. I don't think you should say it's so easy for the Curator. You don't know. I mean, you don't know what goes on around here. I mean, I saw with my very own eyes how shy she was about it. And I don't think it's very fair to make fun of her just because she can make something so beautiful and you can't. I think you just have to accept the fact that you can't do it and be glad that someone else can. So, uh... I just wanted to tell you that. Thank you, Polly. So, uh... I'd like to see it. - I guess I'll leave you two alone then. - But we've got to meet that guy. Oh right, that guy! Sorry, Warren. Have a look, it's out there in the gallery. Polly will show it to you. We have to run. - To meet that guy. - Yeah. Try not to look so happy, okay? Must you always comment on appearances? It's right in here. And then she didn't come in to work much any more, and I didn't have very much to do. I guess I missed her. Dammit, this is what men are for. - Now, don't be sexist. - It's just a joke. You understand jokes, don't you? You're so politically correct. Why are we whispering? You'd think we were criminals. Yes, next best thing. We're partners in a victimless crime. Mary, this is ridiculous! It's going to have to end somehow. Why? Besides it's a little late for a change of heart now, isn't it? I need a drink. I could swear I had some Scotch in my desk. Let's just have some tea then, like nice girls from good homes. Gabrielle, I just wish you could relax into it. Can't you see it's perfect? Then why do I feel like such a shit? I could kick Polly... Sweet imbecile. She just wanted to help me overcome my shyness. I guess I should let her go now, it's too dangerous. Polly's irrelevant, you know that. You're the one who decided to go along with it, Gabrielle. Can't you just think of yourself as my pseudonym? You don't seem to understand that I couldn't do that debutante artiste bit, I'd gag. This way I paint, you talk. It's perfect. Polly? It's so late. Why are you here? You told me... I guess you two should talk. Polly, you're drunk! It's not what you think... Listen, maybe you could help us. It's not so terrible, Polly. But I believed you. I know, I know you did. But... you'll see that... this is not, you know, this is not at all what you think. No. I'm telling you. Tomorrow you'll see it in a totally different, different way. I'm sure. I can explain it all... So, it's been a little while since it all happened. I guess the Curator's probably still in the hospital. And I guess I'm going to probably have to move away or something before they come to arrest me... or sue me, or whatever they do to criminals. How was I supposed to know it was hot tea? But you know what the most amazing thing is? It's this, it's this feeling... it's this, it's like... it's this feeling like I'm out of breath or something. I mean, it's a really wonderful feeling. I mean, I know I should feel guilty about it, but it's a wonderful guilty. How can I tell you? It's... Psst. Anyways... there it is. That's what happened. So I guess I'll be, I'll be going away now. You could probably just give the furniture and everything to Dora. Oh, she's the landlady, or you could probably rent it out as a very, very nice... furnished bachelorette. That washer and dryer, they're brand new. Polly, it's me. Gabrielle and Mary. Can we come in? Yeah. What's this? Oh, I just, I just borrowed that. I was going to give it back. I want to explain. Oh. I don't feel good about lying. What about your face? Oh. It'll be okay. Well, I didn't really... I didn't mean to hurt you. - I'm really sorry... - Gabrielle! Look at this. These are yours? Those photos that came into the office... were all yours? No, I stole them. I'm so sorry. Come here, I'll show you some more.
