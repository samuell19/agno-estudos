So, what are you in for, Randy? Me, uh, I'm on probation. It was a court order to come handle my hallucinogenic addictions. What's your story? Well, my homicidal ex, Liz, she gave me her addictive personality and all that shit that comes with, too much to drink, too many unknown pills to pop. I managed to get rid of her, dump her and run. Came all the way out to the middle of nowhere to this rehab to get sober, and to hide out until she gave out and found somebody else to destroy. Guess what? She followed me out here. Running didn't work! Running from my problems didn't work. (SIMPLE RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (LOUD THUDDING) Hmm, all right. First I got rid of my problem, then I left my problem. Why didn't it work? Uh, okay, so you have an addiction problem, right? Yeah. You brought that problem with you. So, maybe this is the place to get the both of you clean, happy, and married. No, no! No! What's honestly wrong with a girl who's gonna chase you all the way to the edges of the earth? Fresh coat of paint, man, she'll be good as new. She's a psychopath. I need to get out from underneath her claws! And drugs, bad. Yeah, drugs are bad. What the hell are you doing? Bad! What, weed doesn't count. Yes, it does. (SIGHING) Really? Rehab, no drugs! No Liz. Yeah. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get this bitch kicked out of rehab. (ROOSTER CROWING) I'm proud you finally admit you have addiction. (PLAYFUL RHYTHMIC MUSIC) How can there be a 12 step program with only 11 steps? Where is step one? Someone has stolen step one. All right, no bother. (PLAYFUL RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Hello! Ah, right. Step A, time to get to know each other. Ah yes, of course, you in the, in the breasts. Okay, so my name is Elizabeth Blueberry and this is my boyfriend, Ethan. I am not her boyfriend! Funny story about how we met. So, I was waitressing at the Club B down on Union and in walks the cutest little unsober man in a sequins dress. He had the brightest blonde wig on with a little star hair clip in and he zigzags over to me and orders a strawberry daiquiri with a side of blueberry. Well, from that moment, I was hooked. I mean, I couldn't just leave this little transvestite. I lost a bet, I didn't have a sex change. Oh my god, there was this other time when we were together... Hi! My name is Ethan. And I like southern blues and stickers, and masonry, and chicken, sweet and sour. (SLOW PLAYFUL MUSIC) Right. And what about you, mister, uh... Mister... Step B. (GROANING) (SCARY TENSE MUSIC) Right. (PLAYFUL RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (GROANING) Seriously, more gray hairs, Ethan. (PLAYFUL RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Hey, let's get out of here. No! Did everyone see that? Did everyone see that?

Ah, yeah. You want it? Yeah, give it to me. My god, it's so good. I know, right, I told you these new cheese dogs would be. (GURGLING) Minty! (LOUD SCARY MUSIC) (GROWLING) Step B. Step B, step B. Knowledge, knowledge. Acknowledge that your addictions are not in moderation, but are causing problems in your lives. (SIMPLE RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Or solutions. Now, I want you all to realize that your addiction is much closer to animal instinct than conscious choice. And therefore... (GROANING) Stomach virus. Okay, we're gonna practice these everyday. I want all of you to say after me, I have an addiction that an animal inside of me is trying to control, okay? After me, I have an animal inside of me, I have an addic... After me, I have an addiction that an animal inside of me is trying to control. I have an addiction that an animal inside of me is trying to control. The animal will not control me. I will control the animal. The animal will not control me. I will control the animal. Where is everyone? Do we have any drugs left? No, Garrett, my butt hole only holds so much. Hey, you think we should tell the others where we hid step one? Hey. Oh baby, oh baby. Mind if I do. (SPLASHING) (DEEP DARK MUSIC) Garrett, what gives? (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) What the fuck? (LOUD GROWLING) (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (SCREAMING) Right, step D, turner of the grounds. What does this have to be with rehabilitation? (GROANING) Now this, this is progress.

(LAUGHING) But all my money is locked in my account. The bank said I need $100 fee in order to transfer all of my funds into this country. Those bastards. I know. (PLAYFUL RHYTHMIC MUSIC) I mean, if that's (MUMBLES). It's all I have but you could borrow it if that's, princess, if you need to... How can I ever repay you? Well, with money, it's not a big deal. Damsel in distress, if I can be there. Such a waste of time. Help you out, that's fine, I mean. Come with me. Okay, yeah, all right. (DEEP TENSE MUSIC) Fuck this shit. Ah, do me a favor, put these upstairs on the table, okay? (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (GROANING) This is such a waste of time. Don't you have a better file? I know, I'm never gonna get anywhere with this piece of shit file. Good thing a girl's got a lot of hiding places. Hey, hey, she's leaving, leaving! She's quitting, she's quitting. She has to leave the farm, right, Bert? Well, maybe she's just going to take a shit. A woman's body is her own business. Things that try to control us are evil! She will suck out your soul and fill you with all sorts of drug paraphernalia because she can't be alone with her own morbid fascinations and hallucinations! Maybe you shouldn't try and date people like that. Well, unless you wanna bring them with you. Right, Ethan? You're doing great, Bert, thumbs up. Hey, Teddy Dexter, my main man! It's Ted, Bert, I have you told countless times! Insurance purposes. For insurance purposes, yeah, yeah. Now, over here, we have lots more buildings, which many of you...

(DEEP SCARY MUSIC) (SCREAMING) I'll wait it out for a bit. (DEEP DARK MUSIC) Why do you hate me? Are you serious? We love each other. No, pill head, that's the drugs talking. You don't know what love is. I met your mom. And all the time we spent together. Time? You don't get somebody's love by giving them something they don't need, getting them addicted to it, and then control them with it. That's not love, that's all kinds of twisted. You're cute. And then you take naked pictures of me (MUMBLES) and post them to an all gay men's fashion show contest. And we won! You really needed the money too. So you could buy more cocaine to make me look like an even bigger fucktard. And have you looked outside lately? There's zombies, like fucking for real zombies! You should concentrate on that. Okay, baby. (DEEP SCARY MUSIC) (LOW GROWLING) I think the coast is clear. (SCREAMING) (SCARY INTENSE MUSIC) (GROWLING) Sorry. No means no! For men too! (MUMBLES) Randy! Ethan! (LOW GROWLING) Where are you? I'm stuck in the toilet! Um... Zombies! There's zombies! I know, right! And they, they have me trapped! We need something. Weapons, we need weapons. (DARK SCARY MUSIC) Whoa. I knew it, insane psychopath. You're so adorable. What, I found it. I noticed. Let's go save Randy. Why do I have such fear and hesitation about this mission? (DARK SCARY MUSIC) All right, come on. We are not together. What is with you? (GROWLING) (SLOW SCARY MUSIC) We'll use the tractor as a decoy. It's all right, Randy, we got ya. (LOUD GROWLING) (ENGINE REVVING) Oh, I think I can escape. (GROWLING) Crap. (SCARY SLOW MUSIC) (LOUD GROWLING) Worst possible outcome ever. Oh, no, no, no. (GROWLING) (GAGGING) Help! Help! (GAGGING) (GROWLING) I guess he's done in the washroom. Randy. Randy! You! We gotta get to the house! (SLOW TENSE MUSIC) Hello? MAN: Hi. All right, nice bloody hatchet you got there. Okay, Liz, we need to get you some better protection. Did anybody else just hear... Holy shit, stab, try some perfume. (CHIMING) (GRUNTING) (DEEP TENSE MUSIC) (SCREAMING) This will do. Hey, we need to find a landline to call for help. What's a landline? Like that? Yes! MAN: Squeeze those thighs around me tighter. ROSY: Baby, you like that. (MOANING) Did you get a dial tone? ROSY: Mmm, baby, yeah! You said you wouldn't love another! MAN: Who's that? Is this some kind of joke? No baby, I don't know who that is. (MOANING) Who is this? MAN: I like this, the man voice needs to go away. Is this the police? We're having a zombie apocalypse here. Okay, it might be an isolated incident, it might not be a worldwide epidemic. Somebody told me I sounded like Sting. I'd have a lot more money. Whoever this is, I'm on a business call, hang up. Rosy! Liz, just give me like 10 minutes. No, five minutes. It's an emergency, we have to call the police! Rosy, are you in the main house? ROSY: I'm in the basement. Did you close the door? ROSY: Did I close the door? (DEEP RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (SCREAMING) Rosy! Hey! (SCREAMING) (INTENSE FAST MUSIC) I'm really not into this shit. Damn. (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Rosy! Shit. (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) What the fuck. LIZ: Shit! We have to do something! (SCARY DARK MUSIC) (GROWLING) Get her out! Come on! (SCREAMING) (POUNDING) (DEEP RHYTHMIC MUSIC) That was too close. (GROWLING) Whatever. Well, dibs on whatever the fuck this all is because this is gonna be for me. We are not together. No? You hit me in the face with a shovel. Well, you had a fly, sweetie. Blow it away. Well... Have you ever been woken up by having your face smashed in? I broke up with you. You were just kidding. No, I even said, seriously, this isn't a joke, and then I left. And then you came back. To get my shit. I said, even then, the only reason I'm here is to get my shit. I reminded you four times we were not back together. Well, I just thought you were sleepwalking again. No, I said I hadn't done that since I was a kid. Just because it's dark doesn't mean I'm asleep. It was 4:00 in the morning. Look, if I didn't have Gabriel under the covers with me, I would've invited you in. I thought you were either sleepwalking or there for a usual late night booty call. (SIGHING) I was there for my shit. (SIGHING) True love. Still don't know where you got that shovel. From Jane and Tina, our neighbors. It's for my garden. What is this shit now? Whoa, lady, okay! We need to just focus on survival, zombies. We need a plan. (BEATBOXING) (SCARY MUSIC) How are you doing that? (BEATBOXING) Yeah, okay, we need a plan. Yeah, yeah, we need a plan. (ROOSTER CROWING) This couldn't possibly be more messed up. (SIMPLE SOFT MUSIC) (GROWLING) (FAST RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Whoa. What the fornicate kind of party is going on here? (DEEP RHYTHMIC MUSIC) Holy shit, there's a lady outside. (TENSE DEEP MUSIC) (GROWLING) There's a zombie running for her. Wait, what's she doing? Oh, she's picking up a rock. (EXCITING MUSIC) No, you don't! BOTH: Holy. Shit! Yes, direct hit. Way to go, lady. Hey, the way is clear. The way is clear. We could probably get to the fence. The way is clear. Try to get the bedpost. (DEEP SCARY MUSIC) Shit! Clear the way. Okay, it's even more messed up. Guess I'll see you around rehab land, honey. Leaving, infestation here. SHe's cute. Affirmative. (EXCITING RHYTHMIC MUSIC) (GROWLING) Here, hold this. (DEEP TENSE MUSIC) We should try and get to the country store. Yes, oh man, I need some fine sweet barbecue thinley sliced potato heaven. What? To call for help. Right, like the FBI. Or the state trooper. Or the Seals! Or pest control! Good thinking. Here, help me move this pallet, Liz. (GROWLING) (DEEP TENSE MUSIC) Holy shit fuck!

You and your types, you drug and alcohol abusers. You give us true medicinal drug users a real bad reputation! Your time is over. Your time is over, Ethan! (SLOW SOLEMN MUSIC) Medications.
