"PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 1" A thousand years ago before the dawn of the golden era a comet appeared in the Chola sky. Emperor Sundara Chozhar who ruled in Thanjavur had two sons and a daughter. His eldest son, the crown prince, the brave warrior, Aditha Karikalan defeated the Pandyas on the Sevur battlefield, beheading their King Veera Pandiyan. To avenge their king's death, Pandyan assassins infiltrated the Chola kingdom, vowing to destroy the Chola dynasty. The younger prince, Arunmozhi Varman had arrived in Lanka with his vast fleet to win that land. Meanwhile, the tempestuous Aditha Karikalan was leading an army to the north to conquer the Rashtrakutas. While his father, the Emperor, lay ailing in Thanjavur. The Emperor and his two sons were in mortal danger. In the sky the comet was baying for royal Chola blood… Rashtrakuta Nadu My prince. My prince. Fireballs! The armoury is behind the east wall. Destroy it! Victory! Victory! Victory is ours! Victory is ours! Victory is ours! Hail to Prince Aditha Karikalan! Hail to Prince Aditha Karikalan! Prince, the king of the Rashtrakutas, King Khottiga lies at your feet. Khottiga. I welcome a glorious death. Hail to… Go! I will not slay another unarmed foe. - Go! - Aditha, kill me! Sparing my life is condemning me to a life without dignity. Give me a glorious death. Slay me! Aditha, you're making a grave mistake. A wounded elephant is a tiger's mortal enemy. The crown prince awaits us. Come, Semba. Let's go. Salutations to the Chola crown prince. Vallavarayan, you have bathed! Nice clean clothes, flowers too. Flowers of glory. At the tavern… - Tavern? - Not the tavern, the temple. Is a winery nearby? Or a temple? Give me your dagger. Prince, will you dismiss me from your army because I drank wine? Your dagger, my friend. I want you to go to Kadambur Fort. My Prince, Part hi bend ran knows the Chola kingdom well, send him there. I'll stay here with you. On the next full moon, an untoward event will take place at the Fort. Our spies have warned us. Find out what they are plotting. Will you go? From there journey on to Thanjavur and inform the emperor. My sister Kundavai is in Pazhayarai Palace. Tell her what you find out. The Chola dam drapes the sacred River Ponni Crops blossom to the sound of the flowing river Stones sharpen to the sound of the chisel Bows stretch to the sound of the enemy All words flower to sing praise of the Chola land I must see the River Ponni before the sun goes down I must admire the lovely beauties Silent as the breeze Crossing barren lands Crossing dusty lands Crossing parched lands Semba! Semba! Where were you? I was worried. Beauty makes me lose the track of Time -O land, as I lie upon your chest -Lush green fields Desires stir in me Will Time turn in my favour? Will my legs never tire? O Semba! I hear you galloping ahead This lady Ponni Singing softly as she flows Gallop away to the valiant Chola land Jump with joy! Swift like the flowing river My friend, go! Fulfil our dreams I must see the River Ponni before the sun goes down I must admire all the beauties Silent as the breeze O fair-skinned beauty Dwell in my heart O mischievous lady Stay close to me So much beauty to behold! Ayya, who is that? The most powerful Chola Chieftain, Periya Pazhuvettarayar. Asking such a foolish question will get you thrashed. Semba! Be quiet. Fool! Your God has given you clay for brains! If my brains are clay, your whole body is made of clay. Stolen clay. Look at the sacred marks stacked like 50 clay pots on your brow. Don't speak of my sacred marks, or I'll pull your tongue out. I have the power of six shastras in me. I am Alwarkkadiyan Nambi. Six shastras? I took your belly for a mountain of appams. Don't you dare talk about my belly! You charcoal pot! You look like a clay owl! All Gods are the same. - Really? Are they all one? - Yes! Then the one God is Mahavishnu. Shiva is greater. Stop this quarrel! Shiva and Vishnu are both Gods. We are all gods. God is in you, in me, in everything. - So God is in this staff? - Yes. Watch as one God attacks another. Ayyo, oh God! Hey, tuft of hair. Big belly! Then this sword is a more powerful god than your staff. Oh God! He's killing me. I am Mahavishnu's fearless servant. Fearless servant indeed! Well, tell me now. Who is the greater god? Shiva? Or Vishnu? When you're sitting on me, you're the greatest of all. Get up. You seem strong and you look intelligent. Let's settle this quarrel. Who is the supreme God? Vishnu? Or Shiva? I politely asked both Gods the same question. They said they were of the same height. I even asked Brahma. - You know what He said? - What? "Vishnu and Shiva are the same. Those who do not believe it must eat mud." I'll thrash you. Oh God! Stop! A brave warrior who carries 64 wounds from 24 battles. The Protector of the Chola Dynasty! The Treasurer! Here comes Periya Pazhuvettarayar! - He is Periya Pazhuvettarayar. - I know. Who is in the palanquin? The Chieftain controls the Chola kingdom and his young wife controls him. Her name is Nandini. She is his queen. Ayyo! Who took my clothes! - Who took them? - Semba! Semba. Stop! - Thambi, can I ask you something? - You're greater than Vishnu. - Go! - It's not about that. Who are you? From where? Where are you going? Three questions. One reply. Who are you to question me? My name is Thirumalai. Also known as Alwarkkadiyan. My goal is to spread Vishnu's glory. I am a devoted Vaishnavite. And my goal is to serve beautiful women. I am a devotee of beauty. So be it. One more question. Are you going to Kadambur Palace? Kadambur Palace? Why would I want to go there? Move aside. A huge feast has been organised at the palace today. Periya Pazhuvettarayar is on his way. There will be music, dance and other festivities. I've always wanted to see Devaralan dance. Semba, I'll sell you. Take me there as your servant. I will be most obedient. Thambi, if you will not take me there, - may I request something? - What? Will you give the lady in the palanquin a message from me? With a belly like yours, you plan to romance a woman? Semba, let's go before we burst his belly. Wait! Take me with you. Thambi! Brother! Go! Make your way there! You won't get past the Fort gates. Shame on you! You disguise yourself as a holy man and assault women? - Sweet mother! - Clear off! You with your tuft of hair. Kadambur Stop! Stop! He does not have an invitation. What do you want? Your name? Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan from Vallam. A ray an is my title. - He says he's Vallava…or something. - Whoever he is, we have orders to keep the gates shut. Your Prince Kandhamaran is my friend. We fought against the Rashtrakutas. 200,000 soldiers fought alongside the prince. Thousands of donkeys too. Is this one of those donkeys? Let go of my horse. I'm going. This donkey has quite a temper. Let go! Semba, charge! Look! Red, red, red, red! Crimson red Kandhamaran. Kandhamaran! You invited me! Where are you? Step back! Red, red, red, red! Crimson red Kandhamaran! Where are you? Kandhamaran! Kandhamaran! Vanthiyathevan, is that you? Now it's bound to rain in Kadambur. - Welcome! - At last! Find the evil spirits! Fell them with a sword Was he the man making trouble? All around us is war, war! Blood is boiling - Who is he? - A dear friend. Vanthiyathevan. A Vanar Clan prince. The Vanar Clan? In whose army do you fight? I fought alongside the crown prince in the Rashtrakuta war. But I am no longer in his army. I am here. They say you have sixty-four battle scars. Don't you believe it? Want to count them? We grew up on tales of your bravery. You have a way with words. Go, watch Devaralan dance. O Red-hued Lord! O Lord of the Spear O Broad-shouldered warrior O Protector of our clans O Lord Muruga The Lord who wields the Spear O King of Kings with steadfast spear Grace us with your auspicious words Will the rains fall? Will the kingdom prosper? Will the glory of our ruler endure? Will our people thrive? The Goddess seeks the blood of royal descent Crimson red, crimson red. Red blood pours The Goddess seeks the blood of royal descent Crimson red. Red blood pours Play the drum if you wish to destroy your enemies Spill the blood of a man of royal descent The Goddess demands a sacrifice. Blood must be spilled The Goddess demands the king's crown The Goddess demands a young head The snake, the raven. Omen of death The Goddess demands a sacrifice The Goddess demands the king's crown The Goddess demands a young head The Goddess demands a sacrifice A sacrifice! How did Sundara Chozhar become emperor? Gandarathidar had the right to be emperor twenty-four years ago. But he died suddenly. So his nephew Sundara Chozhar ascended to the throne. It was not his birthright. We made Sundara Chozhar emperor. - We placed the crown on his head. - True. Because Gandarathidar's son Madhurantakan was a child then, so we left the Chola kingdom in Sundara Chozhar's care. But when Madhurantakan came of age, the throne was not given to him. Instead, Sundara Chozhar anointed his eldest son, Karikalan, the crown prince. The throne was Madhurantakan's birthright. But it was denied to him. Sundara Chozhar did not seek our advice. Was anyone consulted? Some were consulted. He asked Sembiyan Maadevi and Kundavai Devi for their advice. No one consulted us Chola Chieftains. Instead, he asked the women in his palace. - You find it amusing? - Pardon me. Something is concerning me, and others share my concern. What is it? If he's blamed for consulting women, the same can be said of you. We hear you consult your young wife on many political matters. Vanangamudiyar! Mind your tongue! Who are you accusing? I do not accuse falsely, but when we speak of political matters, why must your queen be present? Your question is fair. I am hon our bound to answer. Can you wait till our deliberation is over? Pazhuvettarayar, so what do we decide? Should Gandarathidar's son, Madhurantakan, be emperor? Or the grandson of Gandarathidar's younger brother? What does the Chola land dictate? Gandarathidar is the elder of the two brothers, - so Madhurantakan must be emperor. - Will Sundara Chozhar agree? If we all agree, I shall convince him. What about Madhurantakan? I hear the throne does not interest him. - He is a fervent Shiva devotee. - You shall soon see. Vanangamudiyar, let me now address your accusation. Prince, will you kindly step out? Meet the Chieftains who wish to make you emperor. Prince Madhurantakan Devar! Long live Prince Madhurantakan. Long live the Shiva devotee! Prince, was it you in the palanquin? Is it the prince who graces my humble abode? Yes. I am Gandarathidar's son. I have a right to the Chola throne. I seek your support in fulfilling my destiny. I value your support. Hey, Vaishnavite! - Alwarkkadiyan! - Hurry! Row! Let this rogue take the next boat. Nambi, stop! Hold the reins. You there, big belly! Thambi, mind your tongue! But you responded when I called you “big belly”. Wait! I'm coming. Start rowing! Where are you going? I hear they're serving milk Pongal at the Srirangam temple. What's it to you? With your big belly, you could've fallen, scaling those high walls, - and cracked open like a clay pot. - Me, scaling? What high walls? Nambi, if you don't want to land up in the river, out with the truth. You play the devotee with your sacred markings... - Are they the props of a good actor? - Blasphemy! I'm a devotee of the Azhwars. Nambi, the Kaveri is full of crocodiles. They love tamarind rice-eating Vaishnavas. Shall I throw you in? If you hurt me, Mahavishnu will not spare you. Crocodile, crocodile! Why did you scale the Fort walls? The Fort walls? Who? Me? Really? Wait. I'll tell you why. I was looking for you. For me? Yes... yes. They refused to let me in and I cannot wield a sword. I could've sung Azhwar songs. And if I had, the guards would've kicked me. What choice did I have? I had to scale the walls to watch the dance. - Did you see the dance? - My arm! I saw nothing. Only Devaralan's bottom. They were all bunched together as though in a ritual. They drew their swords and took… What was really going on? - So you saw nothing else? - No. Did you see anything? It looked like a prayer meeting. How are you related to the palanquin lady? Why send her a message? Oh that? The palm leaf message. The truth! You'll turn me into a fish if you keep dunking me into the river. In Pazhayarai, we lived next to Ramanatha Battar's house. One day he found a baby on his doorstep. He called the child "Nandini". She was like a sister to me. I hoped Nandini would grow up to become a devotee like Aandal. But one day she left us and vanished. Then we heard she had married Pazhuvettarayar. And I never saw her again. That's why I wanted to send her a message. What message? "Lord Krishna is waiting for you." Semba, there goes Madhurantakan! Do you wish to see the prince? Are you asking me why? So we can put our strong limbs to use! Move! My horse is blind. Move aside! Move! Prince, your men are manhandling my horse. Prince, save us! You are…? Speak up! Who are you? Pardon me. Are you the Chieftain's queen? Tell me the truth. Why did you barge into my palanquin? Let go, brother. Forgive me, Devi. Alwarkkadiyan, who claims to be your brother, has sent you a message. - Are you his servant? - No, Devi. I am Aditha Karikalan's friend. He asked me to go to Thanjavur. Karikalan? Yes. I fought alongside him in battle. Very well. Let's not talk now. There are spies amongst my palanquin bearers. Come to my palace tomorrow. Show them my Signet Ring. They'll let you in. Thanjavur Semba! What a majestic Fort! We'll build one just like it in Vallam. - You dare mention Pazhuvettarayar! - Are you a Pandyan spy? - Who took my dhoti? - Semba! You fool! Not again! Don't show me your face. Go! Don't you dare follow me. Does one get to heaven even if the guards trample you? No one can question the Velakara guards. Aren't they Sundara Chozhar's personal bodyguards? They're Pazhuvettarayar's puppets now. Last week a boy got into trouble for saying that. He is dead now. - Who are you? - The temple flower-man. Sendhan Amudhan. - Can you take me to the emperor? - Close the Fort gates! Serving you tamarind rice is easier. Who are you? The Pandyan emperor? - What is this scroll for? - I write poems. Have you any ink? I want to rewrite Chola history. I must hurry before the gates close. - You can't go inside. - I bet on my horse Semba. If I come back, I'll reclaim Semba. If I don't, you keep him. Using a wager so I'd look after your horse. Cunning! I live near Thallikulathar temple. What's your name? My Commander, I am innocent. - Your name? - Kadhirvelan. They thought I was taking Pazhuvettarayar's name in vain. But all I said was “Please repair my cart.” - Are you the Pandyan spy? - No. You're mistaken. Commander! He tried to enter by showing us the Signet Ring. Let go! Commander, I come from Kanchi. The crown prince has sent a message for the emperor. This scroll is for the emperor. The other is for Princess Kundavai. There's nothing of significance in it. I'll give it to the emperor. No. I was asked to hand it over in person. Don't you trust me? Or did the crown prince insist you do it? No, it was your brother, Periya Pazhuvettarayar, who insisted I hand it over. You met my brother? Where? - At Kadambur Palace. - Kadambur? He gave me this Ring. - Why didn't you say so? - No one let me speak. Take him to the emperor. Commander, the Ring... Vanquisher of the Pandyas, Cheras and Lanka, may the emperor live forever! Who are you? Greetings, my Queen. I am Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan. Prince Aditha Karikalan's friend. He bid me come here. Karikalan has built a golden palace in Kanchi. - He hopes you will visit it. - Forgive me, Your Highness. The scroll was written by me. It was a pretext to meet you. The crown prince sent me here. - How do I know you are his messenger? - I wondered about that too. He said, "The emperor will recognise my messenger." He asked me to go to Kadambur and tell you what I heard there. Kadambur? Your Highness, the Chola Dynasty is in great danger. Those who swore to protect it, now plot to destroy it. - Who plots? What do you mean? - My Queen. The Chieftains met at Kadambur Palace under Pazhuvettarayar's leadership to plot against your kingdom. The crown prince sent me to spy on them and then come to inform you. - Why didn't you go back to Karikalan? - He ordered me to come here. He said I must warn you and let Princess Kundavai know too. Did you really fight alongside my son? Yes, Your Highness. In the Rashtrakuta war. It was my good fortune. Did you use this sword? No, Your Highness. This sword belongs to the crown prince. When I was leaving, he exchanged his sword for my dagger. - This sword... - ...was forged in my armoury. I gifted it to him. He sent it with you so I would know you are his friend. Your Highness, come to Kanchi with me. You are in grave... I am in grave danger, Your Highness. I seek your protection. I am the sole survivor of the great Vanar Clan. If you return my kingdom to me, I shall serve you till I die. Forgive me, Your Highness. He was allowed in by mistake. Commander, he is Prince Aditha's friend. He bids me visit Kanchi. The Commander has read the message. I will reply tomorrow. He is our guest. Commander, take good care of him. I shall indeed! Your Highness, I must return the sword. Thank you, my Queen. Where is the guest palace? - You'll see it soon. - It's beautiful. You'll sleep soundly there. Your meals will be served on time. Let me have a look around. I'll be back soon. Who will face the Commander? We'll be dead if we let you go. Follow me. If this palace doesn't please you, there's another underground. Is that Velkarar's army? - Yes. - Splendid procession! Don't let him escape. There he goes! Forgive me, Devi. - Can you take me to Pazhayarai? - Thief! Thief! Move! Watch out! Don't be scared. I am a Prince! - Mother, is that buttermilk? - Yes, son. Give me some. Here. To think I jumped over fort walls for buttermilk! How much? It's free. Queen Sembiyan Maadevi's gift to the people. Free? She is a most gracious Queen! There's the spy. Catch him! Move! - He is climbing up. - Let's use the stairs. This way! He's running eastward. Hey you! Catch him! This is the crown Prince's sword. I must return it. Catch him. He's trapped. You have nine lives. Oh God! Climb! Careful. - What are you staring at? - Is that really you? Yes, it's me. Who else could I be? Careful, we may be seen. Last time you had a big moustache, right? Nice question. I will be bald the next time. Move aside! - Come. Devi is waiting for you. - As you wish. My angels! - You invited him? - Hush! Whose paradise is this? Devi, the Sorcerer's assistant is here. You? Indeed. What sorcery allowed you inside at this hour? No sorcery. I climbed up a rope ladder. If you had showed them my Ring, they would've let you in. Why enter like a thief? I was escaping the Commander's soldiers and I saw the rope ladder. You mean Chinna Pazhuvettarayar? Does he not have absolute power here? I showed him your Ring. Don't worry. I didn't mention you. I said Periya Pazhuvettarayar gave it to me in Kadambur. But he did not believe me. - Where is the Ring? - I have kept it safely. I would not lose a Ring given to me by you. You said Karikalan sent a message. No. It was Alwarkkadiyan. He said he was like a brother to you. - He sent the message. - What message? He said: "Lord Krishna is waiting for you." I can no longer become a devotee like Aandal. That is a long-lost dream. I do not agree. Why not? If Lord Krishna were to see you, would He not abandon Bhama and Rukmini? He'd even drive away His 16,008 wives. Men often praise me to my face. If you turn your back to me, I'd praise you even more. Enough! You certainly know how to charm. - Now you're praising me. - Then turn your back to me. I never turn my back in war or before a woman. I stand fearless. You can praise me to my face. You are indeed a true magician! A brave warrior who carries 64 wounds from 24 battles. The protector of the Chola dynasty. The Treasurer! Periya Pazhuvettarayar has arrived in Thanjavur. Why do you look upset, brother? Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan came from Kanchi with a message for the emperor. How did he get inside? He showed us the Signet Ring that you gave him. No! I did not give it to him. So what was the message? Only an invitation for the emperor to visit Kanchi. But I overheard the messenger warn him of imminent danger. Where is this messenger? I intended to hold him prisoner, but he escaped. We're looking for him. He cannot have gone far. Why did I make you the Fort Commander? Any fool can dupe you. Shame on you! Keep the door open. The Pazhuvur lord is here. - You did not tell me your name. - It's Vanthiyathevan. - My title is Vallavarayan. - And your kingdom? The sky above, the earth below. You can win your kingdom back. It is not impossible. Devi, I have no interest in ruling. He had your Signet Ring. That's how he gained entry. I gave it to no one. How did he get it? Who gave it to him? - Who do you suspect? - Your dear wife. Mind your tongue or I'll cut it off! No! - Get rid of her. - Silence! Do me a favour. I give my life for beautiful women. For you, I'd die many times over. But now I must go to Pazhayarai. I have a scroll for the Chola Princess Kundavai. What scroll? I can help you escape from here. On one condition. The reply the Princess gives to this scroll must be brought to me. Will you do that? Devi, it could be dangerous. You will be rewarded. And rewarded way beyond your wildest dreams. This secret passage will lead outside. You'll pass a treasure chamber. Do not let the treasures there tempt you. I stand before a shining diamond. Are you dazzled? A little. Who are you? Glory to the Pazhuvur lord! Where is my queen? Where is Nandini? Where is the Signet Ring? - Have you lost it? - Is that what brings you here? Did you not come to see me? - Who are you? - The Sorcerer! How do you know me? You're a Sorcerer and so am I. See? I have the Signet Ring. Let go! Someone's coming. Do you know the Ring's value? Someone has stolen it. He did not steal it. I gave it to that soldier. He is a spy, not a soldier. I know. That's why I gave it to him. I met him near Thanjavur. I realised he was a spy, so I asked him to come here. I wanted to know who he worked for and why he came to the Fort. He is Karikalan's spy. How did your brother find out? Was it not my Ring that made him suspicious? But he still let him escape. Did the Commander know where the spy was going? He was headed to see Kundavai in Pazhayarai. Once he meets her, he will bring her reply to me. Did I do wrong? My eyes see only your beauty. Your beauty veils your intelligence. I am helpless. Madhurantakan is on his way. Salutations to the Pazhuvur lord and Nandini Devi. Welcome! You no longer need to enter through the secret passage. You shall soon enter as emperor, astride the royal elephant. If Shiva wills it. Ravidasan. You've forgotten the promise you made to King Veera Pandiyan, and the oath we took to avenge our king's death. I carry deep wounds. I forget nothing. Stop this play-acting! It is our duty to destroy the Cholas. Are you now enchanted by luxury since becoming the Pazhuvur queen? You are right. I am enchanted. Will you behead me for that? Kani. Here are the Lankan coins you asked for. Go to Lanka and bring me the young Prince's head. May Goddess Kottravai be aware of this May Goddess Kottravai be aware of the dead king's wrath The brave Pandyas will wash Your feet with Chola blood The Pandyan kingdom is where the Pandyan Emperor lives. This forest is Madurai to us. Behold Amarabujanga Pandiyan, son of Veera Pandiyan. He graces the Pandyan throne. Beautiful dark-skinned Goddess Kali Goddess of the waves, mountains, the arts. Hail Kali! Let us pledge our lives. Glorious Kali. Grace us with victory, Goddess Kottravai! We pledge our lives to the Pandya flag! We pledge our lives to the Pandya flag! We pledge our lives to the Pandyan emperor! We pledge our lives to the Pandya emperor! For killing our beloved King Veera Pandiyan, we will sever the head of the Chola Prince Aditha Karikalan. - Our blood is boiling! - Revenge! Death to his brother Arunmozhi Varman! Death to the Chola Emperor Sundara Chozhar! We'll offer their blood to Kottravai. We will! We will! - Are you the spy? - Hush! I am the crown prince's friend. That's why Pazhuvettarayar is after me. I must go to Pazhayarai at once. But I do not know the way. - Come with me. - Me? - Who will conduct the temple prayers? - Listen to me! I must meet Princess Kundavai. If you do not help me, I'll be caught. You'd be responsible for my death. I will come back as a ghost to haunt you and drink your blood. Very well. Pazhayarai “Attention! A spy has escaped from Thanjavur. “If you see anyone acting suspiciously, “alert the soldiers. “The emperor's command.” I came to awaken your senses I came to make you see sense I came to awaken your senses I came to make you see sense O Demon uncle! O Sun of the night Don't turn red in anger Your sixth sense has lost all sense O Demon uncle! O Sun of the night Don't turn red in anger Your sixth sense has lost all sense Warrior, warrior, warrior! O mighty warrior His bravery is as deep as a banyan tree roots - Salutations to Kundavai Devi. - Sendhan, what is it? I heard the announcement. Are they looking for you? Princess, I'm a poor temple flower-man. Who'd be looking for me? - They're looking for a spy. - A spy? I met a man in Thanjavur. Maybe it was him. He was cunning. He even managed to meet the emperor. Made to destroy. Made from a legacy of might Here comes the king with the face of Kamsan The son of power, eternal friend of Truth Not unlike a pearl. I am the unique and only son O little boy! I have won the universe Conquered all kingdoms. They are mine, O mighty emperor! Is there anyone to equal me in this universe? O Wicked One. O Sorcerer! Who is here? I touch the oceans. The mark on my brow is the sun I parade around North Madurai Can you not think? Are you not strong? I'm just a little child. Have you no shame to shout and rule? What did this spy look like? Like a spy. He claims to be the crown prince's friend. Sometimes he disguises himself as the demon Kamsan. Kamsan? He insists that he must see you alone. If you see the spy again… Should I hand him in and collect my reward? No, bring him to me. I have a task for him. O Uncle! O Uncle! O Demon uncle O Demon uncle O Uncle! Sister! Boatman, careful. A watery grave has been predicted for me. King Kamsan, why did you want to see me alone? Sendhan Amudhan told me. Kamsan will answer. But who you are? Who did you want to meet in Pazhayarai? The Chola emperor's daughter, Karikalan's younger sister. Arunmozhi Varman's older sister. The illustrious Chola Princess Kundavai Devi. I bear all these titles with difficulty. Demon Kamsan, why do you tremble? Are you scared of water? Kamsan? Scared? Demons don't swim in water. We swim in a sea of flames. I wasn't trembling, I was dancing. Princess! What a transformation! From demon to spy. I had no choice. Pazhuvettarayar is after my blood. And that fake Vaishnavite Nambi follows me everywhere. Why were you looking for me? Karikalan sent me to Kadambur, Devi. A secret meeting has taken place there. Prince Madhurantakan was taken there in Nandini Devi's palanquin. I have only one question. Did Madhurantakan agree to the conspiracy? He wished to be emperor. The lust for power surpasses the lust for beauty. Very well. Where is my brother's message? Do you have it? Yes, Devi. I wrote the message myself. Coming empty-handed did not seem right. Show it to me. "This messenger is a great warrior..." Such modesty! Books say modesty must not dwarf truth. What book? The one you're writing? Yes, Devi. In the war against the Rashtrakutas, did you not fight alongside my brother? I was by his side. I killed over a thousand soldiers. All right. A hundred? Over fifty? If I lower the number any further, my bravery will be in doubt. So shall I send you on a dangerous mission, befitting a brave warrior? Is that my reward? After all, you are a brave warrior and have slain over 50 soldiers. That is true. I await your command. I want you to go to Lanka. Find my brother Arunmozhi and bring him to me. Can you do that? I will seek the Lord of Death, if you command me. Really? I swear on you. Very well. I command you to jump into this river. Not the river, Devi. You'll have the message for my brother before you go. But the crown prince is waiting for me. I shall let him know. He'll wait for you. And so will I. There's a reward of 1000 gold coins on your head. Careful! My life belongs to you, Devi. I will stay alive to fulfil your mission. King Kamsan! Do me a favour. When Lord Krishna Himself asks, can Kamsan refuse? Will you give Ponniyin Selvan a message from me? Certainly! Go! Salutations, Prince. Salutations, mother. Madhurantakan, is what I hear true? What have you heard? - That you wish to ascend to the throne. - Mother, the throne belongs to me. To you? Who told you that? Your father gave it to Sundara Chozhar. I want it back. How can you take back what was given by your father? You raised me as a Shiva devotee against my wishes. I am not a Shiva devotee. I am a king. I am not a sheep for slaughtering. The Chola throne belongs to me. I am the elder. My son, you do not know how to rule. Karikalan and Arunmozhi are great warriors, while you can barely wield a sword. Mother, I have the support of many great Chieftains. They have taken an oath to back my claim. I am your mother. You cannot have the throne without my consent. Your father commanded you to live as a Shiva devotee. You cannot stand against Sundara Chozhar. What kind of mother are you? You stand by someone who has taken my kingdom from me. I will never let go of my right to the throne. Even if my dead father were to ask me, I would not heed him. Here, have these prayer beads! Break it down! Break it down! Nulambapadi Charge! Charge! Victory! Victory! Aditha, now that we have won, let us return home. No! We shall defeat the Kalingas next. Your kingdom is in danger, we must go home. Karikalan, anything can happen at any time. Your father, your brother and you are unsafe. There is a plot afoot to seize your kingdom. That's why I sent Vanthiyathevan to Kundavai. She'll take care of things. Aditha, your sister is skilled in politics, but she lacks experience. Victory is ours! Do not underestimate Pazhuvettaryar. This Chieftain is like a fierce lion. An old toothless and clawless lion. Do not misjudge an old man who marries a young woman. Especially one who has poison in her blood. Karikalan, you are the Chola crown prince. You must protect Thanjavur. You are duty-bound. - The kingdom is your responsibility. - Enough! I will not set foot in Thanjavur. You and your brother must protect the emperor. Stop! Enough, Grandfather! Why are you so angry? Angry? Who is angry? Prince, I've noticed you get angry whenever she is mentioned. So you've noticed? So what! Forget her. That's the best solution. Forget? To forget her, I must first cut my heart out. She was mine from childhood. She is Pazhuvettarayar's wife. Desiring another man's wife is a sin. Part hi bend ran. She married that old man... because of me. Her folded hands looked like lotus buds. Delicate as a flower. A pure white flower. I was the crown prince. She was someone who sang at the temple. The entire royal Chola family turned against us. My father warned me. But I did not heed him. Then one day, she disappeared. Nandini! A man dies several times in a lifetime. That was my first death. I saw her again. Many years had passed. We were waging war against the Pandyan emperor. Veera Pandiyan had fled the battlefield. We hunted him in mountains and forests. I found him inside a small hut. That was the day I died for the second time. I became a walking corpse. This wine, song, blood, war! All this is to forget. Forget her, forget myself. Everything I do is a struggle to forget. Tiger flag, war flag. Our flag flies high. The flag flies high The horse is raring to go The stony heart is stirred See the sparks fly on the battlefield Face the enemy with swords and spears Go forth and fight! Let the Tiger Flag soar high in the sky May the Chola Kingdom rule the world! The striped tiger never fears nor rests. Chola! Chola! The fierce tiger does not know defeat, O disciplined one! My love for this land makes me senseless My love for this flag makes me senseless My love for this wine makes me senseless That woman made me senseless My love for this land makes me senseless My love for this flag makes me senseless My love for this wine makes me senseless That woman made me senseless O Demoness! You are my breath, my wound My body is covered with scars from the battlefield But the scar she inflicted stops my heart Worry not! Pass me the wine so I may forget This man's journey will never stop Carry that sword and march on A vengeful tiger never stops With a smile in your heart, celebrate with a drink Come, my friend Is this pleasure everlasting? Is it wrong to desire? We dreamed of winning the world We faced many battles We ignored the Lord of Death, slayed our enemies We forgave foes who surrendered Punished those who opposed us We imprisoned those who ignored our warnings The Chola Dynasty is our life. Taught it. Chanted it. This mantra Touch the clouds, reach for the sky Go, Tiger. Claim the Himalayas! The flag flies high The horse is raring to go The stony heart is stirred See the sparks fly on the battlefield The flag flies high The horse is raring to go The stony heart is stirred See the sparks fly on the battlefield I beg you. Spare his life. Nandini. No! No! Lanka Soldiers, alert! Charge! Wait! Wait! Charge! Attack! Make sure the prince is protected! Victory is ours! He has arrived. The Vaithulya Bikshu Sang am salutes the Chola Prince. Master, you invited me, so here I am. A comet has appeared in the sky. We consulted ancient texts to find out what it means. A great king like Emperor Ashoka shall rise among us. You display all the signs of such a king. The Maha Bodhi Sang am invites you to be Lanka's emperor. This is the throne that once belonged to Ashoka's daughter. All the kings of this island are first anointed to this throne. We give you Throne, Sceptre and Crown. Kindly accept. Justice must prevail here. Lord Buddha's wisdom must rule. This will all take place in your reign. Accept the crown! Accept the throne! Accept the throne! Master, my father commanded me to bear arms for the Chola kingdom. As defender of the Chola kingdom and servant of its people, I cannot accept another crown. I cannot defy my father's orders. So, I cannot accept God's will, or your request, Master. I seek your blessings. One who bows low is destined to rise to the sky. May you live forever. May all your wishes come true! Wait. Let her come to us. - Prime Minister. - Princess. Is all well? Has the emperor's health improved? Chinese physicians are treating him. He recovers well, my princess. What concerns the people these days? They ask why the emperor's daughter is still unmarried. What did you say? A noble prince worthy of the princess is yet to be born. By the time he is born and of marriageable age, I shall be an old woman. She is like dark lightning gleaming like a silver fish Clashing with the roar of thunder Can lightning and thunder co-exist? O eternity, can these two forces co-exist? Welcome, Princess! Your arrival has turned this Fort into a place of beauty. I hear this palace has all the world's beauty within its wall. You're right. Beauty is indeed captive here. Captive? Does the golden beauty not adorn the throne? Yes, but the gold has faded. Faded gold is the most precious. Gold shackles are still shackles. Are they not? But the key is in our hands. One cannot outwit the princess. Welcome. Father, our enemies are amongst us. They want another crown prince. Not Aditha Karikalan or Arunmozhi. Karikalan's friend said the same thing. Who is conspiring against us? Who do they wish to crown? Your cousin. Prince Madhurantakan. This conspiracy was planned by Pazhuvettarayar and the other Chieftains at Kadambur Palace. I cannot believe it. Pazhuvettarayar raised me with much affection. But he is not the same. Did you know the Chieftains have come to Thanjavur in secret? They plan to meet at Pazhuvettarayar's palace. This passage is under Periya Pazhuvettarayar's control. Where does it lead to? - Nandini Devi's chambers. - We must decide today. - Welcome! - My respects to Pazhuvettarayar! Welcome! Meeting in secret like thieves is not right. What if they find out? Chinna Pazhuvettarayar, do you not want Madhurantakan to be the next emperor? Your presence makes it legitimate, Commander. Princess Kundavai has asked Aditha Karikalan to return to Thanjavur. - He may come with a large army. - We must act before he arrives. Let us ask Sundara Chozhar to hand over the throne to Madhurantakan at once. We'll spread a rumour that the two Princes march towards Thanjavur to challenge their own father. Sister, are we meeting Nandini Devi? No. We shall meet the conspiring Chieftains. To imprison them? - No. To unsettle their plans. - How? Through you! Prince Madhurantakan must be crowned without delay. It must be done before Aditha Karikalan arrives. - We'll inform the emperor tomorrow. - We Chieftains have decided. If the Princes join forces, our plans will be ruined. What is it? - Princess Kundavai Devi is on her way. - She is here. The Princess is coming here? Remain seated. No need to worry. It is quite normal for the Chieftains to meet me. She is like dark lightning gleaming like a silver fish Clashing with the roar of thunder Can lightning and thunder co-exist? O eternity, can these two forces co-exist? May I come inside? Or do I offer my respects from here? The Princess is here unannounced. There must be something important. Please come. Welcome, Devi. Welcome, Princess. My respects to you. It's rare to see you two brothers together. My respects to the Chieftains. I was passing by when I heard you were all gathered here. So I thought I would stop by. We were planning to visit you, Princess. Before coming over, we wanted to discuss tax matters with the Treasurer. That's what brings me here, too. We must lower certain taxes. Why? Princes Aditha Karikalan and Arunmozhi are to marry soon. To marry? - They are of marriageable age. - And their brides? We do not need to look very far. You all have daughters. There's Manimegalai, your daughter. Siriya Velaar's daughter, Van at hi, is here with me. Vanangamudiyar, your daughter's name is Madhavi, right? My granddaughter's name is Thirumagal. My daughter is Thamarai. There is no lack of brave women in our kingdom. If their horoscopes match those of the princes, they'll be chosen. Is that not the custom? Do not worry. Arunmozhi is yours. There must be a commotion inside by now. “Commander, what is going on? “Your grand plans have been thwarted by a young girl.” That wily Kundavai! Must she always interfere? No one in the Chola kingdom is more cunning than she. Get away! Aditha Karikalan may arrive with his army at any moment. Kundavai has sent a spy to bring Arunmozhi back. If the two brothers return together they shall seize Thanjavur Fort together. They will kill the emperor and claim that it was your doing. They will say you wished to be the next emperor. Let them come. I can stand up to them. I have waged countless wars. Conflict within the Chola kingdom will do untold harm. A family conflict will give our enemies the chance to enslave us. It will be the end of the kingdom. And the blame will fall on me. There is only one way to stop it. We must make sure Arunmozhi and Karikalan do not unite forces. Arunmozhi alone should be brought to Thanjavur. If the younger brother is inside the fort, the elder brother will not attack. I have a suggestion. If you permit, may I share it? Hey, boat girl! Poonguzhali! Are you playing with me? I'll lose my temper. A watery grave was predicted for me. Did you know that? Poonguzhali! Does the moon not know the depth of the ocean? Will the eyes not reveal the yearning of the heart? Has that wandering cloud lost its way? Have you got spices and salt? There's salt in the sea. Fetch it yourself. When will the horizon and the ocean meet as one? The waves have no markers Hold this. The light of the stars guides us Poonguzhali. Is Sendhan Amudhan your lover? Did that silly flower-man say that? If he said that to my face, I'd throw him into the sea. So, you're not planning to marry him? Why? Sendhan Amudhan is my friend. I cannot betray his trust, but… But? Do I stand a chance then? Don't be hasty. Put that away! Do your work and I'll sleep. - Is this the Lankan shore? - Yes. - What do you want? - Will you do as I say? Certainly. I don't believe promises men make. I swear on the sea, the sky, the earth and the eight directions, I'll keep my word. - Are you meeting Ponniyin Selvan? - Yes. Ask him if he remembers Samudra Kumari. Is that your secret? Is that what your heart yearns for? Even if he does not ask about you, I will remind him. Poonguzhali, I've looked everywhere for you. Where were you? Is that Karuthiruman? What news? I've struck a good deal for the boat fare. We need the money now. Why? - For the wedding. - Whose wedding? Your daughter's? Why didn't you tell me? Hey girl! You don't realise my worth. I'm talking about our wedding. In your dreams! Why save money for empty dreams? Why did you come all this way? To find medicinal herbs, tiger-claws and elephant tail hairs for the emperor. We must gather all our rebels in Thamballai. Our mission is to kill Arunmozhi as soon as we can. Aadhan Ma ran, So man and I will look for the prince. Varagunan, you look for the Lankan King Mahindan. Let me find Arunmozhi. I will kill him. No! You will ruin our mission. What have you ever done? Ravidasan, no! I've never hesitated in taking a life, or giving mine. The time and the place must be right. I will wait here. I cannot enter without the the emperor's bidding. It's difficult to meet Pazhuvettarayar these days. Your Highness, I am your servant. Until you are well, your physicians have advised us not to trouble you. What if I never recover? Will I not see my friend again? Your Highness, we are here to obey your command. Is it true what I hear? Madhurantakan wishes to sit on the Chola throne? Is that right? I also hear the Chola Chieftains have chosen him as the next emperor. I do not care who plots against me, but my word will remain law. Your Highness, I speak the truth. Your sons compete with one another for your crown. Arunmozhi covets my crown? Who claims this? It may be a rumour. - People are talking... - Did you pull out their tongues? You can stop these rumours. Ask your sons to come here. Let Arunmozhi declare his brother the next emperor. It'll end all rumours. True. We have invited Karikalan to Thanjavur many times, but he refuses to come. Our messages do not reach Arunmozhi. Periya Velaar stops them. How do we make sure the princes will come? We must invite Arunmozhi. Send him a message that he must come, or else he shall be arrested and imprisoned. - Imprisoned? - It's only an empty threat. Imprison him? On what grounds? The monks of Lanka offered their crown to Arunmozhi. He refused it. He did not have the right to do so. That crown belongs to the Chola kingdom. He owes the emperor an explanation. Explanation or imprisonment. That is what we will tell him. No. Then he'll be condemned for defying his own father. He's accused of that already, my Queen. Very well. Issue my command. How can a father imprison his own son? How is that possible? It is my body that is ailing, not my mind. Then why? I want Pazhuvettarayar to be responsible for bringing Arunmozhi here safely. They might think they have won this time, but let my sons come. Then I'll decide what's to be done. Go to the northern border and bring Karikalan here. He has a reckless temperament. Only you can make him see sense. Why are you so downcast? You want Arunmozhi to come, don't you? Yes. When I hear them talking, I sense they have a hidden motive. Bring Karikalan to me. Go! Captain, once you reach Lanka, find the prince. Give him the emperor's orders in person. Arunmozhi's Commander-in-Chief Periya Velaar must know nothing. Captain, do you know what the emperor's orders are? My lord, if my men know we go to imprison the prince, they'll revolt. They must not know. The emperor's orders are only for Ponniyin Selvan. My lord. Remember no harm should come to the prince. Let us set sail! No! Thamballai That's too expensive. Thambi, your guru is calling you. Vanthiyathevan! It's me. So you're my guru now? With my sacred markings, I can't say I'm your brother-in-law! So, it's guru. You don't need to bow. I know you respect me. Why are you here? Are you people trained in curing body ache? Oh God. Let go! Goddess Kottravai has sent two guides to help in our mission. - What are you doing here? - The same as you. I'm exploring this Buddhist town. Why are you following me? Who sent you here? Vishnu came in a dream and said He was weary of being in Srirangam so He has come to Thamballai. Lord Buddha is a form of our god. But sadly, without mace, sword or discus. Nor can He fight. - Are you saying Buddha is also Vishnu? - Yes! What else did He say? Did He ask you to snore less? Vishnu said if I happen to meet a warrior who talks too much, I must save him and keep him out of trouble. Hey, Thambi! Did you see that? I see Buddhist monks and beautiful women with flowers in their hair. Not them! I meant the mahout. Alwarkkadiyan, when beautiful women are looking at me, why would I bother about a mahout? How irresponsible you are! How did the Princess entrust you with such a huge task? - Why did you ring the bell? - Vaishnavite! - Can you come with me? - This is what I was waiting for. Come. Nambi! Where are you going? I'm coming too. Go away! - Is this a horse or a camel? - Wait. I'm coming. Nambi! Just wait. - And a horse for me? - I was asked to bring him alone. We must follow them. Lord Na ray an a! Look after my bundle. Stop! - Give it back. - Who is this scroll for? Who are you? Give it back. Or you'll answer my sword. Ayyo, here! Where's your sword now? If you are a true warrior, defeat me in a sword fight, then take the scroll. Stop! Delighted to meet you, Prince. How did you know? The fact you asked how I knew, that's how. Long live Ponniyin Selvan! Long live Ponniyin Selvan! Who are you? Why were you following Alwarkkadiyan? Prince, I am Vallavarayan Vanthiyathevan. I belong to the Vanar Clan. I am Prince Aditha Karikalan's messenger. Who owns this sword? The Prince gave it to me and asked me to see Princess Kundavai. My brother gave you this sword and asked you to meet my sister? Yes. Brave warrior! Welcome to beautiful Lanka. - Thank you. - Did you enjoy my warrior's welcome? If you wish, we can resume our sword fight. I can't fight you. I'm answerable to my sister. - The scroll is written in invisible ink. - How do you know? What does it say? You must come to Pazhayarai at once. Nambi, does nothing escape you? All God's grace! I am a mere servant. Prince, I have another scroll for you. - Guess who sent this one. - Did you write it? Prince, he's a fake Vaishnavite. It's not God's grace. This message is from Princess Van at hi. From the princess? - Another of your skills? - Hush. She gave it to me without Princess Kundavai knowing. She didn't want any fake Vaishnavite present when you read it. Nambi, let's go. - Your bundle! - Thank you. Shall we enjoy some fish? Ayyo! Blasphemy! I am a devoted Vaishnavite. The One whose body is smeared with holy ash. The thief who stole my heart. The thief who stole my heart. Prince, it's safer for you to stay here. That was the Prime Minister's message. Oh! So you're the Prime Minister's spy? Princess Kundavai told me to take you to Pazhayarai. - Wait. - You wait. I gave my word to the princess. The Pandyan rebels are everywhere. You must be careful. Prince, ignore him. He gets scared even if I utter the word "crocodile." - Say it then! - Crocodile! You want me to stay here. And he wants to take me to Pazhayarai. What does the emperor want? Until he commands me, I cannot leave Lanka. You do not know what is happening there. The Chieftains and Pazhuvettarayar are plotting against your father. Lord Na ray an a! My Prince! Hail to the Pandyas! For our king Veera Pandiyan Claim your dead, Goddess Kottravai Claim your dead, Goddess Kottravai Retreat! Retreat! Lord Na ray an a! Dear God! Prince. Stop screaming! It's only a tiny scratch. A tiny scratch? My sacred thread has been cut into two. Nambi, who do you think attacked us? They didn't look like Lankan soldiers. No, Prince. It was the Pandyan rebels. I warned you about them. Prince, who rescued us? Nambi, didn't she look familiar? You must have hit your head! He may be right. I think she looked familiar too. I agree with him. I've seen that Oomai Rani before. Do you know why people call me “Ponniyin Selvan”? Yes. When you were young, you fell into the River Ponni by accident. Mother Ponni saved your life. Thus… Ponniyin Selvan. It was not Mother Ponni who saved me. It was Oomai Rani. When she pulled me out of the water, I saw her face. A face that is now etched in my mind. It was she who saved us yesterday. I realised she could not speak. She was mute. Who is she? Why does she protect me? How am I connected to her? What do these cave drawings mean? What mystery do they conceal? I could not find out. Mother, who are you? Hail to the beloved daughter of the Emperor Sundara Chozhar. Conqueror of Madurai. Behold the Princess Kundavai. She approaches! This old man is weary of seeing bloodthirsty soldiers. To see my granddaughter is as pleasing as sweet honey. I seek your blessings, Grandfather. Bless you. Go, your brother is waiting for you. Are you not Velaar's daughter? You were born to marry Arunmozhi. The elders have fed this dream into my heart for years. Tomorrow if the prince changes his mind, you are all to blame. Until the day you marry Arunmozhi, this old man shall not die. Don't make me wait too long. You are the crown prince. You must come to Thanjavur to protect your father. That is his wish. Is that why he sent you all the way here? Everyone fears you, brother. That is why I was sent to take you to Thanjavur. Until the Pazhuvettarayars reside there, I will not come. - Is it because of Nandini? - No, because of you. The emperor did not drive her out of the kingdom. You did. Yes, I told the queen about her. The Queen sent soldiers to throw her out. - My life was ruined. - It was for your own good. You were jealous. Her beauty and intelligence put yours to shame. She's an orphan. She did not even know her lineage. She could not be a Chola queen. I am not just your sister but also, a princess of the realm. What matters to me are the Chola people. None of us matter. You took her away from me. And turned me into a monster. I was indifferent to her tears. I turned her into a poisonous snake. Since then, day and night, she has continued to haunt me. Aditha, she is married. She is Pazhuvettarayar's wife. Don't I know that? How could she forget me? She once said she loved me. Then she fell in love with Veera Pandiyan and tried to save him. And then she married this old man. How could she? I will not come to Thanjavur while she is there. I cannot. Convince father and bring him to me. I have sent Part hi bend ran to bring Arunmozhi here. He'll be here soon. I'll take care of the rest. Arunmozhi will not come here. He'll be brought to Thanjavur. Orders were given to imprison him. Soldiers have set sail to Lanka. The emperor's command. A Chola ship! A Chola ship! Wait! I'll go and see. How many soldiers are there? About thirty. Are you from the Chola kingdom? That ship doesn't look like a merchant ship. Where can I find Prince Ponniyin Selvan in Lanka? Why do you want to know? Do you mean you won't tell me? Who are we here to imprison? Is your ship a prison ship? Are we here to arrest Ponniyin Selvan? They are Pazhuvettarayar's orders. Lanka is under Periya Velaar's command. Pazhuvettarayar has no influence here. Are we here to take Ponniyin Selvan prisoner? Why was this hidden from us? The Chola people will not forgive us. He is their treasure. Turn the boats around! Do you think I am here by choice? It is the emperor's orders. We cannot disobey his command. Where is King Mahindan of Lanka? “Inside my turban. “Why don't you take a look?” Rascal! You said you came to gather medicinal herbs and I believed you. Your greed brought us here. Take me to King Mahindan. “Over my dead body.” Stop! You will be richly rewarded. King Mahindan will be rewarded too. He cannot understand what you're saying. “They'll kill you before you get near him.” Do you want to see me die? Or will you be the one who will die? No, no. I will take you to the Lankan king. I need more coins for my trouble. You must listen to me if you want to meet the king. Come. Come. Your Majesty, he attacked your camp. He threatened to kill all your soldiers unless they told him where you were. I befriended him... Tell him what you want. I had to use these methods to see the great Lankan king. "You came seeking me. Now die in my presence." I have an important message. A Chola ship arrived yesterday to take Arunmozhi prisoner. Sundara Chozhar ordered his men to come here, my lord. I saw them with my own eyes. Arunmozhi Varman will be without bodyguards and alone on that ship. He'll be defenceless at sea. If you wish to win the war, you will not get another chance like this. I am a Pandyan rebel. I want Arunmozhi Varman's head. Why didn't you say that? My lord, give me twenty boats and fifty soldiers. I'll bring you Arunmozhi Varman's head and throw it at your feet. I can see Pallava's flag. Periya Velaar's men are approaching. It's Part hi bend ran! Salutations to Periya Velaar! Vanthiyathevan! It's me. - You? Here? - I am everywhere. I heard you died at Pazhuvettarayar's hands. I don't believe I'm dead. Your tongue is sharper than your sword. Why not test my sword someday? You haven't changed. I have come with orders from Karikalan. What orders, Part hi bend ran? You must come with me at once. The Chieftains in Thanjavur have turned traitors. They are conspiring against the crown prince. No one can hope to win against my brother. I heard Aditha Karikalan say: “Only my brother can defeat me. “So he must stand with me.” That's why he sent me here. Commander, what do you think? Prince, a boat girl came with news this morning. A Chola ship has moored at the River Thondaimaan. It is here to take you prisoner. - Where is this boat girl? - Here. Samudra Kumari, do you remember me? How could I ever forget? You once sailed in this humble girl's boat. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. Did you really see those Chola ships? - I overheard the soldiers too. - What did they say? They are Pazhuvettarayar's men. They have come with the emperor's orders to imprison you. This is a conspiracy! Maybe. But if these orders carry the Chola royal seal, I'm duty bound to obey. This is folly. There are only two occasions when I must concede without question. When father and ruler command. And he is both my father and ruler. Poonguzhali. - I need your help again. - Say no! Command me. I must go to the River Thondaimaan. No, Arunmozhi. - I can take you there. - Hey, girl… Prince, I implore you. Listen to us. Prince, if you ignore us and insist on going then our army and I shall accompany you. You must not stop us. Vanthiyathevan, put on this turban. Goodness! How can I? It's a Prince's turban. Prince, ask anything else of me. It's not a request. It is an order. It's as though you had poured molten iron on my head. One day you'll wear a crown. A Chola princess will be sitting next to you. I'll be there too. Consider this a rehearsal. See that, devoted Vaishnavite? Watch out! The Chola crown has landed on your head. Keep your head safe. - Poonguzhali. - Yes, my lord. Will you ride the elephant with me? I am blessed, my Prince! We are surrounded by Periya Velaar's army. Prince! A prison ship is here. We must meet it with full force. The elephant has run amok. Save the prince! Go! Prince! Prince! - Stop! - Don't go alone. Soldiers! I am not the prince. Ponniyin Selvan is riding the mad elephant. It ran into the woods. Find it. Go! What a grand ship! So many soldiers. Hey! Who are you? I know many secrets. I know why you are here. I know what will happen. Prince! Prince! So why are we here? To imprison the prince. The young tiger is the first sacrifice. Glorious Kali. Grace us with victory, Goddess Kottravai! The Goddess demands a sacrifice. Blood must be spilled Offer his blood to Kottravai. Offer his blood to Kottravai. Blood must be spilled Stop! Who are you? You imposter! Instead of capturing the tiger's head, we've captured its tail. Instead of capturing the tiger's head, we've captured its tail. Brother… Captain! Prince, they've paid with their lives for trying to imprison you. Karuthiruman! What has happened? They tricked me and fled without giving me my gold. - Who? - The Pandyan rebels. Captain! He is not Arunmozhi. Sorcerer, look carefully. I am Arunmozhi. You can see my crown. Punish me. I have failed. Punish me. Punish me. The turban fooled me. Devaralan has failed. I have failed. Stop! To the shore! Ply the oars! My lord. Poonguzhali, the wind has stopped. The prince! Kottravai! Two heads for you today! - Hail to the Pandyas! - Hail to the Pandyan Emperor! Prince, to the right. Sail towards the ship! Hail to the Pandyas! My lord. O Mother Ocean! Prince! O brightest Sun, where have you disappeared? I look all around the world for you The River Ponni is waiting. The Chola land is waiting The River Ponni is waiting. The Chola land is waiting What is it, Van at hi? What's wrong? The moon is waiting. But the Sun is nowhere to be seen But the Sun is nowhere to be seen Where is my beloved? Look at me. Speak! - Is it Arunmozhi? - Ponniyin Selvan... What has happened to him? The River Ponni has been orphaned, Your Highness. Where is my precious son? Where is my precious son? Composure in trying times is what makes a king a true king. - Control your anger. - This is not anger. It is bloodlust! - To war! - Think before you act. This is Nandini's ploy. When I see her, I shall behead her. Aditha! She is destined to die at my hands. Or I'm destined to die at hers. "PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 1" "PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 2" "PART 2"
