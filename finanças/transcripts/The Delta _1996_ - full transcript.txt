If you didn't, then who did? Man, ya'll know we ain't had no rain in the whole state of Mississippi for over a month. Those fields out there are dry as paper. Where'd these fireworks come from? - It ain't mine, Ron. - They sure as hell come from your store. Okay, I'm gonna have to ask you fellas to come with me. Hey, hey! Come back here. Come back here.
