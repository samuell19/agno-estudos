Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Nice of you to drop in, Bellin. - You're off? - Yes... ...as soon as I've finished my report. They say he'll be tested? Yes, of course. He'll be... ...asked to explain. Let's hope he was mad. Partly my fault... ...but Max was... Max wasn't an ordinary policeman. One dead... one hurt... We'll see to him. They got the lot... 80 grand... They'd just brought it in. They're cunning bastards... Fourth this month. Max here... No, Sir. We missed them again... One killed... I'm on my way. What happened? My informer... tricked me. He told me about Carmona... Renardot's not a policeman. Carmona got suspicious... and made him talk. He's smart. lnstead of cancelling the job... he changed the place. So I'm the fool... once again. What can l say, Max? No need for you to say anything, Sir. We ought to have picked them up beforehand. And the cashier wouldn't be dead. All we could charge them with was stealing a car. They might have done 18 months. We have to catch them red-handed or not at all. They're not pleased upstairs. Worried about my future? Better luck next time. When Carmona's seventy. Forget Carmona. You missed him this time. But there's not only Carmona. What about all the others? All those who steal and kill... under our very noses. They're professionals. They know their job. We do a job too. lt's no good if we don't catch them red-handed. No good. All l catch are amateurs. I'm no good with the big-timers. Let's go for lunch. I've finished my report... on that business of the cellar. Well, Max, no luck? Just as well you're healthy. They're idiots, Max. ldiots versus crooks. Take no notice. We've found Renardot. Stabbed to death. My informer. Where? Behind an Algerian hotel. That's that. What about the fellow who sold them the car? Think he'll lead us to Carmona? l didn't say that, Max... but you ought to go and see him. Of course l must. No detail must ever be neglected. lt's our job. Who did l sell a car to? - Never heard of him. - The car came from here. Red S.S... 755 UE 75. Remember? I'll look up my books. - Who'd you sell it to? - A customer. What customer? A fellow... Who sold it to another fellow... who sold it to Carmona. Maybe. l don't know. Time goes by... The buyer's name. You sell second-hand cars. Don't you give receipts? l know you'll say it's just chicken feed paid in cash... It happens. lt's illegal. No log books... they're stolen. You've sold a dozen of them. We're taking you in. Not that. Why not? lf l tell you something... What? The chap who sold it me is there. - Where? - There. Finished playing the fool? Where will he lead me to? Back to you? Not to Carmona. What's he doing here anyhow? He's come back for the rest of his money. You'll do this. Give him his money. Pretend to be the book-keeper. Let him go. I'll see to him. And me? Go with the lnspector. Explain about your stolen cars. Got a light? Remember me? 41st Colonial lnfantry... the bar at Lyons... Well, what a surprise. Must be twenty years ago. No, I'd left Edith... seventeen, rather. l wasn't sure it was you. - Older? - No... you've changed. l recognised the eyes. Remember the old gang? Seen any of them? Nor have l. Life is strange. Good old Max. What a surprise. Let's celebrate. What are you in? Weren't you going to be a judge? - l gave it up. - What are you doing? ln business. Doing well? Not bad. And you? ln business too, but not the same. Scrap merchant. I've been about a bit in seventeen years. l live at Nanterre. l work in scrap. What sort? Rather special. There's a whole gang of us. We arrange things. We sell all sorts of scrap... iron, copper, aluminium. Where do you get it? Here and there. Building sites... depots. Cut up cars too. And all this stuff... do you... buy it? Not always. Not often? Not often, no. - It pays well? - Not much. The govenor lends us his truck. We just get the leavings. Sometimes l sell a car that's missing. Just sold one. Not what you'd call a great career. What happened? l don't know how to tell you... l was always unlucky. Everything I've done has gone wrong. I've tried everything. One day l thought... I'd killed a fellow. l was in business with him. He gambled away all the profits. So l hit him. l thought he was dead. So l joined the Foreign Legion. ten years. And he wasn't dead... Ten years in the Legion for nothing... lndochina... Algeria... the lot. Then there was a woman. Where are you going? Share a taxi? Your business of copper and cars... What if you're caught? Eighteen months... that's all. But it's all so amateurish. Lots of risk... for very little profit. We're careful. lf l were you, I'd do otherwise. How so? On a bigger scale. What a joke. Our sort of pinching is easy. Doing the big stuff needs organisation. lt's a job on its own. Everything is, Abel. No matter what you are... grocer, gangster, cop or priest... They're all jobs. Let's meet again one day. You never know... Got a pen? lt's a café l go to. Stop at the corner. keep the rest for Nanterre. - You're not... - Forget it. You'll call me? Where in Nanterre? Just before the bridge. I'll show you the way. Who are these amateurs? Juvenile delinquents... We don't know them. now any amateurs? Yes, Sir, l know one. Who wants to pull off a big job? That's new... Yes, it's new. What job? l don't know. Nor does he... but l know he wants to. He told me. known him long? Yes. l ran into him yesterday. What does he do? Scrap merchant. Steals cars and scrap... with a gang. Before doing anything, get more information. now where he lives? Rosinsky's there. You don't know him. We served together. l haven't seen him for ten years. Must be an inspector by now. He'll know everybody in that area. He must be about fifty. Your turn to play... - No trumps? Why not play them? - Afraid of Rosinsky? - Don't give a damn. I've even got the nine. Lucky bastard. Science, old cock. Why not finish? There's another spade. You'd have won the rubber. It was risky. But it was there. Should have finished. What's that? That's our column. Made a mistake. Not on purpose. l said nothing when you did it. I'll buy a drink. A small café run by an ex-madam... Mrs Saidani. lt's there they meet. They hang about... playing children's games. Happy doing nothing. Just a lot of drop-outs. - They work? They steal three-ton reels of copper wire and cut up cars with blow lamps... Not dangerous? Some of them may be but generally they give no trouble. I've no complaints. So you know a certain Maresco? Oh yes, an ex-legionnaire. With the scrap merchant gang. - You want him? But we've been informed... he's going to pull off a big job. So you have informers in the café? I've one who spends his whole time there. But he hasn't told me anything. l know it's true. Tell me about this gang. How many of them? Let's have details about them. Not so easy. Why? They are an odd mixture... always changing. A central nucleus... with satellites revolving round it. The nucleus. The nucleus... are those who work... with Benassard. Who's he? He's the guy who rents them his truck. Makes twice what they do... without getting his feet wet. How many in the gang? Six or seven... There's Abel Maresco... We know about him. The others? There's Tony... Antoine Chantoiseau... He's Maresco's chum. Always together. Old professional boxer... Three convictions for pimping. He lives with an old whore who pays him. Just a poor type. Then there's Louis Serafino... little Lu. He's different. An illiterate brute. He was seven when his dad was guillotined. ln prison dozens of times. Last time in a cell with a cop killer. Not very clever of the Prison Authority. You're right. l also suspect him of having killed a man... but l couldn't prove it. That makes three. Go on. Jean-Marie Patinette... Jean... Serafino's side-kick. No fixed abode. He encourages Serafino to do things. He made him kill that man... just for kicks. They gained nothing from it. He's spiteful but not bad. It seems to amuse him. He's not quite all there. The rest? Guy Loranger... the youngest... twenty-four... He's a student... or rather was. He first went to the café to convert people and finished by staying there. Last, there's the son of Mrs Saidani who runs the café. Lives with his mother... Spends the time driving... and smashing the cars his mother buys him. Good-looking... big smile... and no brains. He's always with Dromedary. That's my informer. Lovely fellow. He has several women working for him. That's the lot. A fine team. Not bad. Six guys capable of pulling off a job. What sort of job? A hold-up. l don't see them at it. Not the Bank of France. A little amateur hold-up. They're small fry. But they may grow up. With all this unpunished crime it's no wonder if such riff-raff think ''Why not us?'' Quite. When that day comes... l want to be on the spot... not to kill them... but to catch them red-handed with minimum risk. That might make others think. What am l to do? Simple... Draw up a description of each of them... and keep them under supervision by your... ''Dromedary''. That's all. Sorry to be a nuisance. But glad to see you. Supposing they don't. l don't think they're made for the big stuff. l wouldn't count on them. Then we won't have to worry. - That's true. - What is? They may take a long time to... Yes, till they find a victim. So we must help them to find one. Help them? - Careful, Max. - Yes, l know it's not easy. l mustn't see Abel or the gang again till the day... they pull off the job. Then... how will you manage? l don't know. - Using the car? - No, want it? Don't see much of you. Yes, l come in late. Here's your check. l was in Lyons. Cecile is expecting a baby at Christmas. - The fifth! - Yes, they're pleased. Good wine crop. Your father says it's the best for the last twenty years. He'll send you another check soon. You ought to write... Any girls? Yes, four... lda, Nicole, Jeannette and Lily. What are they? Prostitutes. lnterest you? - Who's with Abel Maresco? - Lily... A German. Born in Hamburg in 1941 . Father killed in the war. Been here three years. She works mainly at the Etoile. On the streets in Munich in '59. She was with a chap who made her take drugs... Attempted suicide in '65... Then she met Abel... ex-legionnaire. Her pimp was in jail but his pals were watching her. Abel half-killed one of them, so they both ran away from Germany... and landed here. Now, Nanterre is her home. She didn't look much when she arrived, but she's improved. She's on the streets again now. He lets her, but doesn't take a penny. Nanterre may not be much... but she likes being at Saidani's café. The gang respects her... and she wasn't used to that. She's quite a queen among them. - How much? - Twenty. How much for you? As much as you can. How much is that? No limit... A million, if you like. Minimum is a hundred. Don't bother. Don't bother to get undressed. You don't want to? What do we do? Nothing... Just relax. Something wrong? No, why? l don't know... We do nothing? l like cards, but I've no time now. Why then? l found you pretty. Haven't you friends to play cards? too many of them. Don't you ever do it? Not with girls l pay. Hasn't this happened to you before? Not often... Well... once... there was a journalist... What's your name? Lily... You're well-heeled... 300 Francs for doing nothing. So you mind? And what's your name? And what does Felix do? Guess. l can't imagine... Journalist? Doctor? Lawyer? Dairyman? Sure you don't want to? You won't change your mind? Give me a hand. Jeweller? Police? l don't know... Politician? Banker? Right. You're a banker? You must be rich. Fairly. Sun all the morning... Madame Cramer only lives here three months a year. She lives in Switzerland. lt's tastefully furnished... and the rent is reasonable... considering how comfortable it is. The kitchen... Very little noise... Bathroom. A doctor lives to the right... Plenty of cupboards... - lt's lovely... - l wouldn't go that far. Make yourself at home. A drink? Whisky? Champagne? No, red wine. lt's pretty. So here's where you live! No, just a little hide-out... For the girls? Where's the bank? Rue d'Argonne. - Want an account? - Perhaps... Haven't l the right? lt's not a very big bank... Just a local branch. - No money in it? - Yes... too much sometimes. There are the wholesalers. The wholesale meat merchants from the market. Help yourself. There's the money. Take it. Take what you want. May l? Can l have a bath? Feel at home. I'd like to live in a bath. - l knew it! - new what? You don't make love... You're a pervert. No, a photographer. Turn your head. No, like that. Go on washing... l don't like it... Only the head. Nothing else. Speak to me. Don't smile any more. - Just talk. - lt's not easy. Suppose I'd taken 1 ,000 from the table... Why not try? Sit on the edge. Not bad. Close your eyes. Open. Beautiful eyes. Say something. lt's nice to be rich. Who doesn't think so? Money... money... MONEY! One should make lots of money. You do too. lt's not the same. Yes, it is. What's wrong is not to make it... when you can... and to be broke at forty... What about luck? Luck? You make your own luck. An unlucky man deserves it. Just a fool. Or perhaps not just a fool. Luck is an excuse for laziness or lack of courage... and guts. You agree? Where do you live? Nanterre. Alone? Got a boyfriend? What does he do? Just lives. You work for him? Oh no, I'm independent. And your money? l spend it. l love that. l put some away... in the bank. So you should. Game of cards? What? Poker... or rummy... Gin rummy... I'll get dressed. - How much a point? - One Franc to start. Next time... you take a bath and I'll photograph you. Strange... lt's as if... - What are you going to do with them? - Sell them... for a good price. Five of diamonds. Who taught you? Friends, pal. How many? Maximum. 30... 40... 50... 58 less 3... 55. ln spades... - 1 10. - That's very good. Married? Any children? Divorced. No children. Then all you've got is your bank. Felix the egoist. Taking that? Just to annoy you. Good idea. Bastard. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. l always do something silly. And it's on the carpet. It really doesn't matter. Shall we go on? We'll do what you like. You're a wonderful man. Sid your wife love you? I've no idea. That's damned funny. A pal of mine... been robbed. Think that's funny? A pal? Not him... his bank... Forty million. A gang came in... took two minutes. And the police? What can the police do? They can't guard all the banks. Aren't you afraid? Only on market days. ls that often? Twice a month. Your pal must be mad about it. Why? He's insured. So nobody cares! Why Nanterre? l like it there. You could find better. I'm all right there. I'm parked over there. l won't see you next week. - Don't you love me anymore? - I'm off to New York. I'll call you when l get back. - Are you normal? - Normal? Sure you're a man? They're not there. - Sure? - We'd have seen them. They've gone to the new site near the factory. I'll take over. We had to change places. I'm coming. Just five minutes. What a business. My poor boots. - What's wrong? - Worn out... and for nothing. l owe so much... I'll not get a penny. You never do anything to make money. You won't take mine. l haven't reached that level yet. Then go and get it yourself. Not in your wretched scrap trade. You must get out of it sometime. Money is in the banks. Then crack a bank. You're funny. I'm not funny, Abel... and nor are you. What's up then? You can't go on like this, Abel... and I'm not sure l can. Go on like what? Spending my life with a man... who has no ambition. lt's not for the money... it's for you. You make me laugh. lf you have a bad manager... you never have good fights. You, with your old girl, can always eat. I'm not complaining... but l have to do my bit. - How Tony must suffer! - Going to cry? but l remember the good old days... l was well-known in society... and now... I'm at a dead end. Well, we're not supermen... What can we do about it? I'm like Abel. I'd like to make a packet and get out. Where to? l don't know... Brazil... Venezuela. Just needs organising. The thing must be properly worked out. What do you say to a hold-up, Tony? lt's all l think of in her bed. Why not do it? Bash the old girl over the head and take off with her dough. Because she's not mad. There's not a penny there. lt's all in the bank. Give a hand, someone? For ever with that bloody fool. You took the photos down? l like a change. ls it broken? And New York? What about it? A fine city? What is a fine city? I'm just asking. There are dustbins... niggers... cops... yellow taxis... very dirty... and whores. But they're everywhere. Even in New York? Yes, even there. Be much longer? Much. Nothing to drink in the house. Why am l here? What am l doing here? l like company. Costs you a packet. lt's worth it. Well... l don't give a damn. I've never met a man like you. You've never paid attention. Always been like that? Yes, always. Married for long? Not very long. Still see her? Mind me asking? lt's of no interest. lf you won't even talk, why do l stay? l pay you, don't l? lt's your job. You're a dirty bastard. But it's true. lt's your job. Not to watch a madman mending a clock. My job's as good as yours. l may be a whore but not for just anybody. Give your money to others. I'm through. What's up? Nothing. Not with the others? Truck's done for. Coming to bed? Thinking? About that business. What you said last night. l even told the boys. But what...? We can't just hold up someone... I've an idea. My banker. l told you of him. l can find a bank without your help. But we can't just go and rob a bank. This is a small branch. The money comes in twice a month. Much? He said so... About twenty to thirty million. Twice a month... Do you know what days? Rue d'Argonne, you said. - It's all set? - It looks like it. - When is it for? - I've no idea. Don't talk nonsense. I'm not. You know me, Sir. l know you only too well. l tell you what I've heard. They're talking about it but... they've not said when. - known him long? Ten years or so. Just after you left. Eleven years then. Max is worth knowing. He was a judge in Lyons... before he joined the police... What a sacrifice. Didn't matter to him. He has a private income. Judge? Why did he give it up? One day he was obliged to free a murderer... - He knew he was guilty. - Lack of proof... l know. He couldn't take it. Since then, he's been obsessed with cast-iron proof. No secretary? l had one. She's left. There he is. - Well? - lt's a bank. What did l say? Where? When? A local branch near the meat market. What day? They don't know. Then we're no further forward. We can't very well tell them the best day. Obviously. Anyhow, they're decided to do it. The girl will find out. - From whom? - The banker who shags her. Oh, l see. Well, that's fine. Beer, Max? So, keep at it... and let me know. You're the banker? - What's the bank like? - ldeal. Narrow streets... easy to block... - Traveller's checks... - Exchange counter, opposite. Right, listen. lt's a small branch... with one counter and... a cash desk... rather like the one near the station... Any money there? The wholesale meat market is round the corner. - How many staff? - About three or four l saw. Now here's a plan of the streets. Crossroads here. This is it... the bank's there. You go in through double doors... There's the counter. The cash desk... - There's no street there. - Don't interrupt. That's easy enough. So along we come... One stays in the car. And one at the door... So we go in. What do we say? We say: ''lt's a hold-up''. They'll understand. When they see the guns... You're not in it. I'd have liked to but l can't. - You're afraid. - What? Shut up, both of you. Or I'll drop the whole thing. keep calm, Abel. Right. We shall need a large bag for the notes. - And guns... - Yes, I'm afraid we must... We'll ask Brahim. And the safe? They must open it. - Suppose they won't? - Knock 'em on the head. A little tap on the nut... They'll understand. Suppose it goes wrong? Goes wrong? Well, if the cashier rings a bell... - Then we fire! - We fire if they move a finger? Better not... lf we don't we'll go to prison. We'd be fools to fire. The big shots manage without it. Just frighten them. When's it for? When? l don't know yet. I'm here. You didn't want to see me. l came all the same. The key was in the lock... Good. l won't try to understand. Why should you? You like me all of a sudden? l always did. Later on... what will you do? Later? l don't know... Lt depends... l have some money saved up. Not as much as you, but l have. Don't give me any more money. I'll come for nothing. l don't think you're right. You think you know me. You don't know me, Lily. Not at all. True... and yet it would be quite easy... This one doesn't work. The clip? You must oil them first. lf the banker doesn't speak we'll have these guns on our hands. Flog them to Brahim... Why not do another hold-up? - You must be mad... - What? The supermarket. Good idea. We know how it's run. Lots of dough at the end of the day. 20,000 at the most... divided by six. Well, there are other possibilities. Let's think. I've an idea. Let's hold up Bob's mother. You don't know my mother. She's not afraid of you. Go into a ring with her and see what you get. l tell you what. The new service station. Car hire... restaurant. There's a packet there. Mad idiot. Give me that. l just shot at the truck. Silly bastard. - Who let him go? - l did. l didn't think... From now on, Tony keeps all the guns. lf Old Ma Pillet heard, she'll tell the police... Well, now they've formed a real gang. And my informer's not in it. - Has he been found out? - No, they don't suspect... They may not tell him their plans. That's all. l thought you said that you were sure of him. l still am... but not of the others. They've changed character. They have guns now. Of course they have. They won't do a job in a hurry. Shall l drop you off? l don't understand. Everyone's ready... Them, you, me. We just need the date. And that's up to you. So what are you waiting for? Stop fooling around. lt's not so easy. Phone, Lily. Felix here. You busy? Sorry, l can't see you Tuesday. I'll have to work late. Wednesday is the day when the money comes in. Can you hear me? See you next week. Or I'll call you. Right... call me then. Have a drink? He's beside me. Not fooling you? He was there with them? Yes, the whole evening. She didn't even mention it. Ring me when you have any news. She didn't tell them. Well, now! Anything wrong? Tell me. A lot of kids. They want to break into a chemist's. l don't know where this'll all end up... lt's all my fault. l shouldn't have... What? Seeing him tonight? l think so, yes. Should l turn off the light? Excuse me, I'm off. ln a hurry? Here, the girls are always in a hurry. Go abroad. lt's not the same. Why should l? I'm in Paris. l remember one day... No, it wasn't there. Where was it? Tell me next time. Wednesday. - Where are they? - With little Lu. Tony goes on ahead. Don't leave the bus stop. You're waiting for a bus. We arrive with the car. Who pinches it? Bob, okay? 404 or l.S.? l.S.'s better. Yes, if possible. When you see us, give a signal to let us now all's clear. What signal? Scratch your nose or something. I'll do that. When we get out, you join Bob at the car. Engine running. We go in the bank and bring out our guns. l shout to the staff to put up their hands. Jean goes behind with the bag. You and Guy keep the staff covered. keep an eye on the cashier... - Cashier, alright. - And the door... Both of them. And the rest is easy. We pocket the cash and then... just fade away. - l say... - What? Nothing. l can imagine it all. lt's essential that all of you reconnoitre the sector. You all have photos? They'll come from there. We'll track them with radio cars. No uniforms there. Local police not to budge from there. We let 'em in and catch them as they go. You go into the bank as a customer and wait. The manager's informed. Don't bring out your gun... The movers start work at 9.30. Serigny with me. You block the road with your car when the fun starts. - All set? - Yes, no problems. Any questions? Right... tomorrow at 7am... They've no chance. Not much. Need me any more? No. See you tomorrow. Perfect. lt's time to go. Well, so long, fellows. Got everything? A last drink? He mustn't drink. l think we're all set. - Hell. - What's up? Go and see. lt's an accident. Lots of cops there. Another coffee? What about you? - Must be a mess. - He's not even hurt. Look at the girl. Have a nice time. Stop playing the fool. - lf he only knew. - Get a move on. What if there's no money? We'll come back and nick his bags. Shut up... l.D. 1 9, maroon, white roof, 457 LJ 45. 5 men inside. Corner McDonald Street. They'll be with you in two minutes. Hands up. lt's a hold-up. Get against the wall. The bags. Don't fire. Stop fooling. Take her to the café. Shoulder. Not serious. Finished. lt's all over. - It was l who told... - l know... l know because l am not Felix... the banker... I'm a policeman. A cop. You'll have no trouble. We've been sold. Dromedary. We ought to have suspected it. What bloody fools we are. Well, it's a success for you. l can tell you now. l was worried. But you were right. Right... Just like you, Max. You want something and when you get it, you're not happy... He really is excited. What about? He's carrying on enquiries at Nanterre, where he has a right to. What enquiries? He wants to get people as accessories. Specially the German girl. I'll see you straight away. May l smoke? You can go in. Why's she there? Lily Ackermann... Like the other café girls. She's an accessory. She wasn't in it. l don't agree. The examining magistrate will decide... ln a case like this it's not the police who decide... as you well know. But you brought her in as you well know. l thought she ought to be questioned. She's done nothing. lnciting a lot of thugs to rob and kill... That's an external view... Are we supposed to have internal views? Don't chop logic with me. I'm responsible for Nanterre investigations. And that's that. So don't interfere. l didn't criticise your little plans. Leave her alone. What does that mean? l say leave her alone. The others too, l suppose? Without her they'd be free. She's not responsible. Then who was responsible? How far do we go? As far as... the banker? You know l was the banker. Ah yes... the cosy little flat-let. Not everybody has a private income. l can do nothing against you. So she'll pay. Bastard. Mind your manners. There's nothing more to say. Leave her in peace. I'm doing my job. l shall go on doing it. You won't stop me. The girl will pay. After I've taken her statement, she'll go to prison. You're mad. He's killed him. See to the inspector. Why did he do it? l don't know. l thought l knew Max. Obviously, l didn't. Unbelievable. By killing Rosinsky, he joins the others... ..where he wanted to put them... In prison.
