Good. - Neither do I. - I don't like lying. - And I don't like cheese. - Cheese? Its texture is somehow disgusting. Okay. Tell me what you like. I like the sea. I like African food.

I need money for a beer. I don't have any. Go back to your cage. Take a look at this. - Let's trade. Give me twenty... - Twenty? Okay, a tenner. You can have this. - I won't buy stolen goods. - I'm not a thief. I found this. I was digging up bottles from the recycling point - when I saw a horrible crash. A sports car hit another car. There were ambulances and policemen. I found this at the scene. - I was hit by a rock. - What is this? I crashed with my bike and fell on a stick. Here's another. I fell from a swing on my sunglasses. - What a little rascal. - You don't know half of it. I bet you haven't done anything naughty. - Graduate Adebayo, come play with us. - Okay. Do you want to come? Luckily I haven't done anything naughty. I can't tell him. I can't tell him. I don't want to tell him. I just want to be happy. Why shouldn't I? What's so wrong with that? What do you mean? Nothing, I was just... - Hi, I'm Anna. - Afya. So you're Toni's girlfriend? The hospital cleaner. - Have you been long there? - I started a couple of weeks ago. At the same time as Delmar was brought there. Did you do your A-levels? Or haven't you graduated yet? - I went to school. - Which one? - Helsingin normaalilyseo. - Where do you live then? - On Ketunleip?tie. - The school isn't in our district. Do you live at home? - No. Why do you ask? - I was just wondering. Did you leave your necklace home? - No, I don't think so. - Come on, Afya. - You have a beautiful name. - It means "shadow". - I won't look at the mirror - I want to forget I want to leave you behind - The city's full of memories - I've gotta get away - I don't want to face them - I've gotta get away - And I know this is stupid - I've gotta get away But I can't stay I didn't stare after you when you left after our kiss It was the best and the last I tried to be so strong I tried to hold my head high But look at me now, I'm like a drenched dog - Many miles behind me - The engine is revving up The longing begins to ease - The city's full of memories - I've gotta get away - I don't want to face them - I've gotta get away And although it will be easier tomorrow I can't stay here - Someone was asking about you. - Who? I don't know. She didn't tell her name. A dark-skinned girl with big golden earrings. - What did she ask? - When you started and all that. At first I thought she was waiting for you, but she didn't know you. Then she left. Who was she? Anna. - Father woke up for a moment. - Really? We're waiting for the doctor - but it's possible that father will recover. - I'm so happy! - I can see that. Sorry. I'm Anna Helminen. - Sofia Adebayo. - Nice to meet you. Mother... Anna, would you like to eat dinner with us? - Anna, do you want coffee? - Yes, please. - Have you tasted African coffee? - Not that I recall. Thats a strange way to talk. Thank you, Anna. - Let's do each others' hair. - I have beads and hair clips. - Really? - We'll be leaving soon. - Where are you going? - To Anna's place. - Don't go! - We'll come with you. No, you won't, you piglets. - Should we go? - Okay, that's enough. Go now. - It was nice to meet you, Anna. - Likewise. Bye. This is horrible. - It doesn't matter. - No? At first nothing happens, and then... ...it does. This is horrible. I'm going to kill myself. - No, you won't! Stop that! - Don't try to stop me! Silly. - You're wonderful. - No, you're wonderful. Too wonderful. Basically this is all your fault. Okay. Hello there. - How do you feel? - Toni... - How are you? - I'm tired. You need some rest. Father, guess what? I'm in love. - Is she a good girl? - Yes. She's the best. Just rest. Love me now, when everyone else is gone When shadows creep across the floor I'll take off my shoes because you're a burning bush Stop the funeral, the departed is missing A crow flies over a field and doesn't shed a tear Cafeterias open their doors Today a traffic accident will take away someone's body of steel Do we still have beer? Father? Father! Father! Help! Someone! Help! Luckily I have you. I would die now without you. The number cannot be reached... - Hanna. - Hi. Where are you? - We're in Budapest. - We're in Buda, not in Pest. I see. Is Ada there? - What do you mean? She's not here. - She's not there? - Where is she then? - With you in the Caribbean. MINISTER'S DAUGHTER MISSING FOR WEEKS Harri, Ada's coming here. - Is she alright? - She sounded fine. Sunrise on a frosty morning The land is beautiful Everybody has time to celebrate Let's go again We're partying again, but we don't regret it We're tired, but there's no time to sleep We're partying again, but we don't regret it We don't feel sorry for our past It's not our fault the world is crooked and the clock runs backwards We're partying again, but we don't regret it We're tired, but there's no time to sleep We're partying again, but we don't regret it We don't feel sorry for our past It's not our fault the world is crooked and the clock runs backwards Ada. You lied to me. - I'm truly sorry. - What an earth you were thinking? Luckily you're fine. Where's mother? - What do you mean? - How come? Why do you ask about your mother? Your mother is dead. - When? - When you were a little girl. She died in a car accident. A drunk driver killed her. - No... - Ada. Where have you been? What has happened? Ada, what has happened? I've done the worst possible thing. MINISTER'S DAUGHTER MISSING This is what we're going to do. We'll forget the whole thing. - What? - Just keep quiet. They'll handle it. - How? - We'll settle out of court. - I intend to confess. - No, you won't. I have to. I'm in love. What does it have to do with this? I can't do this. I'm in love. - I heard you the first time. - I love Adebayo's son. Toni Adebayo. Hi. Mervi said that you'd be here. I have to tell you something. About your father and that car crash. I know. - How? - Shut up. I know your game. - Let me... - Shut up! Shut up! I love you. I've never loved anyone else. "I'm so sorry." I don't remember anything. - I don't know who I am. - Neither do I. I tried to tell you... many times - but I couldn't because you said you'd die without me. I thought that when your father would be better - you would forgive me. Forgive you? I should kill you. Kill me then. Kill me. - You might remember Hanna. - I can't remember you either. But you loved Hanna. Hello. - Hi, Little Bean. - I can't remember you. But I remember you. It feels like you were gone for ten years - and came back. She She made me believe She made me hope And more She She made me laugh She made me sing She gave me a song She She was a good fairy She was the queen of the night Now it's nothing more than a name for a song She When summer turns to autumn and I see leaves flying I feel the same longing When she's away She She made me laugh She made me sing She gave me a song She I'm tuning my guitar again And I hear the familiar tinkling Like she was here with me That's the deal. 100000 euros for not pressing charges. And an agreement to maintain secrecy. Let's go. Are you really considering it? - Tell them to stuff their euros! - Toni! - In coins! - You put me and father to shame. I accept the deal. Toni will study political science. He needs money for his studies. Luckily he won't study law. Toni. Hi. How's it going? I love you. I've always loved you. I know I'm not Anna or whatever her name is - but I've always loved you. I would never betray you. Say something. Why did you have to meddle? Why did you... You should have let it go. I didn't want to know. I'm sorry. Forgive me. This is just so unfair. So unfair. What's been going on? Nothing much. Except this morning, when I looked in the mirror - I thought my eyes were brown when in reality they're green. I was puzzled. It was out of sight. Sorry we didn't stop you from taking that car. We were afraid because we had given you pills. - Then we went on holiday. - And you tried to pull Niko. - Niko who? - My boyfriend. - Did I try to pick up your boyfriend? - Always. - I'm truly sorry. - So you don't remember a thing? No, I don't. The doctors said it's psychological. They did all the tests. There's nothing wrong with me. Cool. My father told me your father will buy you a pad. I don't know. I've got a one-bedroom apartment. Muru's my roommate. - We should get an espresso machine. - And our own barista. A lovely Italian man. Like Francesco Totti. Yeah, Totti! Is this Mervi Takalo? This is Anna... or Ada... or whoever I might be. - It's good to see you. - I don't know about that. - I look horrible. - No, you don't. - You're pretty. - I've met a man. - But it came to nothing. - Why? He's a shoemaker. They're all high on shoe polish. - We're going playing. - Okay. How are you? Is your memory recovering? - You never know. - Do you want it back? I don't know. Toni's family will not press charges. My studies will begin soon. My father's buying me an apartment. - Life goes on. - That's good. Are you still thinking about Toni? I remember the first time I kissed you I remember how much I was afraid I remember saying something beautiful to you Something I've always wanted to say Don't leave me, I need you Don't you ever go away Don't you ever go away I wanted to love more than ever I wanted to give you anything I could I tried to be good and friendly I wanted you to know how much I care Don't leave me, I need you Don't you ever go away, don't you ever go away Don't leave me, I need you Don't you ever go away, don't you ever go away - Are you ready? - Yes. Your hair is flat, but it'll have to do. Goddamn it... Go ahead. Hello, my name is Ada Helminen. I want to confess that I stole a car when I was drunk - and crashed it. I accidentally killed Delmar Valentin Adebayo. On June 2nd 2009, Helminen was driving a car - with the licence plate OGX-942... while inebriated. Involuntary manslaughter on July 1st, 2009. Helminen has... Please stand up. - Do you concede these charges? - Yes, I do. Toni, where are you going? Toni, will you call me tonight? Out of my room! Get out! Don't touch my stuff! Do you understand? Get going. What? It's my room. Someone has to discipline them. - Inya called me today. - Why? - You spent the night with Afya. - So what? What is it to Inya? - What you were doing there? - You don't want to know. Where are you going? Someone has to visit Ada. I can see it's not going to be you - so I will go. - Ada who? - Ada Helminen who is in prison. How can you say that whore's name in my father's house? Do you know what is worse than father's death? - Nothing! - The person you've become. I love you more than anything. Your father loved you too. What would he say now? We survived the war and had you. Do you understand what it means? You have the chance to live. You're flushing your life down the toilet. It's like you drink poison and wish Anna would die. I mean Ada. I guess they are two different people. But love... She crossed her fingers and looked at the heavens above And was thankful because she'd been blessed with love She wished for much but she was given even more But there was one thing she had ignored Only for a short time love is like driven snow It is pure like snowfall in February's morning glow Oh how I wish it would shine a little longer But it will always fade away when the darkness gets stronger When the bitterness begins it rarely stops And there's a small eternity between teardrops When a child falls asleep on your lap after a long day Or asks you to come home to stay Only for a short time love is like driven snow It is pure like snowfall in February's morning glow Oh how I wish it would shine a little longer But it will always fade away when the darkness gets stronger Only for a short time love is like driven snow It is pure like snowfall in February's morning glow Oh how I wish it would shine a little longer But it will always fade away when the darkness gets stronger - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm okay. Mervi visited me yesterday. She dares to come visit me because this is a women's prison. If there were men here, she would fall in love. How are you holding up here? At first it was terrible - but now life goes on more steadily. I'm not as scared as before. - How's your life? - Nothing special. I work, my studies suffer. I'm tormenting my sisters and my mother. I... ...try to forgive you. But it's so damn hard. I know. But I can't help you with that. I guess not. You have to forgive every day. That's why it's so hard. I was surprised when I heard about your visit. - Were you delighted? - Maybe a little. - A little? - Yeah. - It's not easy to meet you. - Likewise. - What is it? - Nothing. - I just remembered one thing. - What? "It's cobra. Have some more cobra." - Deep-fried cobra. - Sweet and sour mouse. Sweet and sour... I guess this is yours. If you love the cold moon Things and book covers Car doors and metal skins I won't come with to the seashore And I won't draw your picture in the sand If you love windows Silver mugs, sable furs A guest book with a leather spine I smile at you from across the street But I won't go with you to a fancy restaurant - to eat goose breast If you love sailing Travelling and the Canary Islands You will go away and I will remain here And I remember you without longing I remember the morning when the wind blew in my hair And took away your photo If you love banknotes I will help you to spend them And I will give you anything you want But I won't give you my heart If you love books too much I will ask you what will happen to me When you know me from cover to cover And my plots will bore you And you remember everything by heart If you love little girls and little boys Dogs, grandmothers, old maids, salad and celery root Roast mutton, spring mornings Lonely men at cold stations I will come with you to the seashore And I will draw your picture in the sand And I will draw your picture in the sand And I will draw your picture in the sand And I will draw your picture in the sand Your picture in the sand Directed by Neil Hardwick Producer: Jarkko Hentula Screenplay: Katja Kallio Cinematographer: Pini Hellstedt Editor: Harri Yl?nen Music: Leri Leskinen Choreographer: Osku Heiskanen Sound designer: Pasi Peni Set designer: Kaisa M?kinen Costume designer: Elina Kolehmainen Make-up: Marjut Samulin Hey, listen to me.
