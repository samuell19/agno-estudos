DOG SYMPOSIUM "The woman you call mum isn't your mother." Monique turned pale on hearing those words from a school friend. At once she ran to Madame Duvivier. "She wasn't lying, I'm not your mother. "Why didn't you tell me? Is mum dead? "She's Marie. She often comes by "so she can talk to you. "Now Il understand." Monique rushed to Marie's. "You didn't have the right to leave me! "I was so upset. I didn't know who your father was. "I have no father either? "Now you've found me. "No. "Nothing will ever be the same." ln despair, Monique flees to Bordeaux to forget. From now on, sex and domination shall rule Monique's life. Eager to satisfy her appetite, Monique goes from one lover to the other. They were close at hand. It started at the hospital. At 2 am, a young male patient calls her. He asks for a tranquilliser. Then, while tidying his bed, the girl's hands slip under the sheets. She starts stroking his stomach. She caresses him harder when she notices the sick man responds to her touch. Disregarding every prudence, she climbs on his bed. She has no underwear on. It's a quick embrace. Not a sound. Christmas Eve 1966, Monique's about to see her greatest dream come true. She goes to a dancing club with a friend. Parked outside the club, she spots a beautiful bluish grey Alfa Romeo. Fate had it all sorted out. A 65 year-old man asked her to dance. He was the owner of the Alpha Romeo. Back at their table, Monique has a few glasses of champagne. Thoughts rush through her head. Monique undertakes a long-term seduction plan. When Hubert drives her home at dawn in his splendid car, she realises he's dying to spend the night with her. "Good night", she says. "I'm very tired." For months, she plays this subtle game. Then she lets him know she wants to be provided for. But Hubert might eventually get tired. And she'd lose all the luxury she cherishes. She'd be alone and poor once again. Every evening, Marie solicits. The ephemeral love embraces and easy money trap her in a vicious circle. Nobody knows why Monique, the cold and dry voiced whore bears in her eyes the sadness and tiredness of her past. Learning about her origin gave her an urge for revenge. In her small flat, luxurious though discreet, the TV dissimulates the loneliness of her afternoons. One day, Monique sends for the TV repairman, a boy she remembers from her home village. Henri is happy, he has a job. He repairs radios and TVs. Deep inside, Monique likes this hardworking boy. While they reminisce about life in their little village, she can't help feeling irresistibly attracted to him. Henri can't even dream Monique leads such a sordid life. He falls madly in love with this pretty girl. Surprised by her own feelings, Monique contemplates the possibility of a new life. With some money she'd saved through hard work, she'll make an old dream come true: to run the "Joli Mont" cafe. In fact, she's buying her own death. Henri helps her with advice. When they open the Joli Mont, he helps her run it. Everybody in town loves her. Alice, a friend from Bordeaux, comes to the Joli Mont. She knows Monique's sad past. Alice wants to trade her silence for some money and a place to stay, to get rid of a violent pander. Monique acquiesces. Reminiscing about Bordeaux, Alice starts feeling irresistibly attracted to Henri, that big hardworking boy, who deep inside resents his job as a repairman. Henri can't even dream Alice leads such a sordid existence. He falls madly in love with his wife's friend. "I forgive you, Henri. "You'll be a nice boy again one day", says Monique. Henri takes them both to a park near Montsouris. Once there, he takes both women for a walk. He and Alice pair off to play ball. Deeply sad about the latest events and lost in her thoughts, Monique walks off with her son, Paul-Henri, in her arms. He's 3 years and 4 months old. "I'll never be happy", she says. She opens her purse and takes out a gun. Suddenly, the drama occurs. With one bullet only, Monique kills them both. Having got over that, Henri's only option is to marry Alice, his wife's intimate friend, who dominates him. In a way, Alice was buying her own death. Henri never expected the awful revelations Alice made on their wedding night. Monique wasn't as pure as he thought she was. Neither is Alice. Those women were linked by an unnatural love. Henri was blinded by an urge for revenge. At night, he roams the city streets, while Alice runs the Joli Mont. "I forgive you. You'll be a good man again one day", says Alice. Quietly, Henri stares long at his wife. A red veil comes over his eyes. Mechanically he grabs an empty bottle of wine. Alice lies flat like a cumbersome dismembered doll. "What now?" wonders Henri. He has only one way out, repulsive as it is: to chop up the corpse into little pieces to hide them more easily. He goes about it mechanically. Henri spends days hiding every single piece of the body far away from his home, doing many return trips. Still, he's afraid. He wants to get away very quickly. With some money he'd saved through their hard work, he goes to Marseille where he falls into the debauchery of the port life. Some old friends offer him a shady deal. Henri accepts it. But things aren't so easy. Once is not enough. He must do many little rackets. The Police track him down. Henri falls for a ridiculous racket. He gets 5 years in the Baumettes prison. One night, 2 am, a young inmate who's sick calls him. He wants a tranquilizer. As Henri helps the sick man, his hands slip under the man's blankets. Disregarding all prudence, Henri climbs on his bed. It's a quick embrace, no sound. When he leaves prison on remission, he's a torn being trying to rebuild his life as a free man. Weeks later, he learns that bits of a body have been found in the town of Montsouris. Surprised by so many pieces, the Commissioner Maurice Jose Moraire asks his men to draw on the city map the spots where each piece has been found. To everyone's amazement, a kind of macabre circle appears on the map. "Find its centre", shouted the Commissioner. The centre of that satanic circle is the Joli Mont. Being obsessed with order, Henri placed each piece at a regular distance from the crime scene, making a circle. The universal geometric laws gave him away. Social Security Reception ln consultation with Mr Benami, he's amazed to find out about some operations they do in Casablanca, where one can amend nature by choosing one's own sex. The perfect disguise for Henri. Who could see the man under the feminine creature fashioned by that famous German surgeon. Henri Odile has become a charming young lady. Some make-up hints add a final touch. On Christmas Eve 1974, Odile's ambitious dreams are about to come true. She's been invited out by a 65-year-old man. At their table, Odile has many glasses of champagne. Thoughts rush through her mind. Odile starts to believe she can be rich and live in luxury and pleasure. Every evening now, Odile solicits. The ephemeral love embraces and easy money trap her in a vicious circle. But nostalgia has a hold over her heart. Every evening, Henri-Odile remembers a place in France where he's been happy, the town of Montsouris. He could go there. He's now beautiful Odile Fargeaux, with the papers and the money to be happy anywhere. In Montsouris, Henri walks along his childhood streets. His feet take him to the bar. A sign surprises him: "For sale". It's too tempting for pretty Odile. A bit like an old dream. Everyone in town loves Odile. Days go by in absolute bliss. Luigi is an orphan. His parents died in a crash. He lives with a neighbour. Odile will adopt that child. She has the means to provide for a small family. Every evening, Odile closes the bar quite early, at midnight. Yet, one evening: "No, Fernand. We're closed." From behind the glass door, Odile shouts. "What a brat!", she thinks. He must hardly be eighteen. She tries to scream. He puts his hand on her mouth. A red veil comes over his eyes. She must be quiet. A few days later, at school, Luigi is pestered by his mates: "Your mother was killed by her lover". "That's not true. The woman you call my mother wasn't my mother. Translated by Evaldo de Medeiros Subtitling processed by C.M.C. - Paris
