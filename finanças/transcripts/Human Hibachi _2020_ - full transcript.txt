Can we get you anything? No, no thanks. All right, Officer Hutchinson will be right in. Thank you. How are you? This is Officer Hutchinson, the date is Thursday, September 12th, 2019. Police Department, regarding case 2018-010-075. This is a multiple homicide investigation that occurred at the. I'm here seated with the victim's mother, Nancy Williams. Nancy for voice identification purposes, please state your name out loud? Nancy Williams. Okay, the time is 1515 hours. Okay, we're here to present you with the film made by the culprits in connection with your daughter Katie's murder, along with her friends. Thank you. You instructed us you'd rather watch that here with someone. Well, I just feel safer here, I don't have anybody else and I'm all alone. That's why I was willing to do it. Thank you. I must warn you again that this footage is quite graphic. I've been doing police work for 15 years, I've never seen anything quite like this. And granted it's a small town, not much happens, but ask any of my three officers and they'll tell you the same, this is complete insanity. You mean it's like a real movie? What kind of sick people do stuff like this? Well, you could call it a movie. There's music, different scenes, they've edited together, they really knew what they were doing. Filmmakers or something. I know it seems insane that they would wanna document their crimes and sell that, but once something like this hits the black market overseas, that's where it usually stays. Apparently there's a lot of money in it. I'm ready, I won't sleep at night until you put these people away. Well, we do have most of them in custody, and our goal is to eliminate anyone who's had any part in this. Thank you. I assure you we'll reach our ultimate goal on that. Now, if for any reason this becomes too much, or you need me to stop at any time, please let me know and I will. I appreciate that, thank you. Hello, welcome to my restaurant. Hi, thank you. Are you dining alone? No, my boyfriend's in the bathroom. Oh, okay. Thank you. You don't mind if I take a picture of you, do you? I like to have them in my restaurant for very special guests. Sure! So on three, say sushi, one, two, three. Sushi! Oh, wait- Wake up beautiful. Happy birthday, baby. Aw, they're beautiful, thank you. Come on, it's your birthday. You gotta get up early, it's only come once a year. Oh, you're supposed to sleep in on your birthday. What is with the camera, Reo? Well, I wasn't sure what to get you this year. So I decided I would document your 35th birthday on camera, so you will always have it as a memory. Oh, that's thoughtful, I guess. I eventually added two or 10 minutes of video. It's very thoughtful Reo. I look like shit right now, though. You always beautiful. These tits so great, baby. I know, like you tell me on a daily basis. Also, if you wanted to get me something that lasted a lifetime, you could have gotten me an engagement ring. That will come soon. I've been hearing that for a year now. I have the day all planned out for you, we have a lot to do. Oh, really, and what is that? Just follow my lead. Okay, well, I'm going to get a shower, and you are not documenting that. Can I, please? No, shut it off! All right, fine. Reo, what the fuck, I told you not the shower! Aw, come on babe, this won't make the final cut. Stop, seriously? Stop videoing me on my birthday! How are they?

So there's a gift card in here for the next time you guys come in on us. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. You're welcome, enjoy. I had to it. Most embarrassing thing ever. Are you trying to get me fat? There has to be close to 1,500 calories in this slice. Hey, it's your birthday, there's no calorie counting today. Yeah, you're right, you're right. You should be ordering cocktails. It's 10:00 in the morning! You've gotta give us some good stuff to make this video exciting. How about you can film us fucking later? Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. You wouldn't let me film you in the shower earlier, but now you are ready to make a porn video? I'm obviously kidding. Time for the cake? Do you want a piece? No, you know I hate cake. Come one, you have to, it's bad luck not to eat a piece of my birthday cake. You're right, it is. But first, I have to document you actually eating cake. Come on, you can do it. It's terrible. It's delicious, suck it up buttercup. See that's not so bad, I'm proud of you. Asian don't eat cake. Well you should then, 'cause it's delicious.

I would like to look at you, instead of surfing porn site, is better than looking at strange woman, isn't it? It is, but it's still strange if you ask me. How is it weird? It just is. Okay, well can we finish? Yeah, as soon as you turn the camera off. Okay. And then make sure that stuff is deleted as well. Whatever you say my dear. Someone had one too many drinks. Reo, it's five o'clock. Wake up Reo, work is calling you. Hello, hey Jin? Yes, we will be there soon. Coming in with another couple too. Okay, I'll see you then.

Reo I think maybe you need to take her home. She had like three bottles of wine. Come on don't be a party pooper, I've seen her worse than this. What the fuck are you doing? What is that? Drink much tonight, you won't feel anything. Why are you filming this? Ooh my God! Please somebody help! No, no, no! - She won't feel a thing. - Good, better that way. That is why I wanted you to get her drunk. I told them there's a lot of money in this. There is, these guys pay very good money for each bag. Tonight they're only paying for two, so it's going to be this, birthday girl and this guy. Tell Ben how much they pay? - 50,000. - You can do the math, Ben. Most importantly though, this video we're making tonight, will be sold for tons of money over in Asia, these are huge. My cousin in Japan told me video with real life killings are big in black market over there. What about our faces being on camera? We blur our faces out, Reo, you think I'm stupid? I didn't even think about that? This is going to be it for me though, I'm shutting down the restaurant after this. And I'm going to take the money, heading back to Japan and start real businesses. I never wanted to do this, but the restaurant wasn't making the money I expected to make. my ass,. These men that are coming tonight, share a common friend with me, and this was proposed, I couldn't say no. Plus I love the fucking money. After I get rid of these three, I'm heading back to Japan. I'm happy for you Jin, I'm glad I could help you. I'll take care of you guys tonight as well. Come on, let's get everything's ready for these guys, they're on the way. That will keep her out totally?

Holy fucking shit! Some craziest shit, - isn't it? - This is a fucking joke. He's not okay with us filming it? We all have companies, behind all this filming stuff as well. We are splitting the money. If it wasn't for him there is nothing to film. Perfect operation. He wants to see the final product before we sell it. We have to make sure everyone is dulled out. Of course. That's them. Hey, everything is locked down, right? - All secure. - Excellent, thank you, you did an amazing job preparing this. I have been craving some good meat all week.

What about those intestines that are in the fridge? Why weren't they served? I must have forgotten. Yeah, wrap them up too, all right? And I gotta pay you, right? No less. And now, for the grand finale, the penis. Hey, boss, it doesn't make a man gay when he eats another man penis? No Phil, it doesn't make a guy gay, eating another mans dick. That's why they call me gay, no? And even if it does, what's wrong with being gay? Hey look, I'm not paying you to be fucking in charge- - , I'm just joking boss. I don't wanna fucking hear it, I will not tolerate hate language- - , again? That dick is so good. I'm joking boss, don't get mad, you know? After a decent size too.

I wanna thank you guys for coming, like I said, and unfortunately my dad is not here at the moment because he's always runs late, as you , but I want you guys to really enjoy this motherfucker, Reo, immensely, and indulge because he was a real piece of shit. He thought he was gonna get over on me, unfortunately it went crashing down on him, right into that pie, actually. I never liked him and I never really cared for Meghan, she was just a piece of ass to me. But when I found out that he'd fucked her, I knew where his fate was.
