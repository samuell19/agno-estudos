(ARROWS WHOOSHING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (COMPUTER TEXT DINGING) (UPTEMPO SMOOTH MUSIC) JACK: I learned early on in my career that a job well done has three critical parts. - ID badge, please. - Sure. It's here somewhere. Ah, there we go. (SCANNER BUZZING) (SCANNER BUZZING) JACK: First, the right crew. It takes more than one flint to make a fire. (SCANNER BUZZING) Almost got it. I'm here for a private viewing. (SCANNER BEEPING) Yes, sir, down the hall. Thanks. (UPTEMPO SMOOTH MUSIC) (SCANNER DINGING) JACK: Two... there's how things are, and how things appear to be. Is it normal for museum guards to have machine guns? They weren't there two days ago when we did the recon. Alpha, what's the call? This feels off, but we've got to stay the course. All right, which door is it? Third door on the left. TREY: Other left! (SCANNER BEEPING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where is it? It's hanging on the wall right when you walk in the room. I'm in the room, it's not here. What? You're in the room? What the hell? (VAN DOOR OPENS) (TENSE SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Shit! (TRACKER THUDDING) Abort, abort! We've been compromised, abort! (CANISTER CLANKING) (ALARM STARTS PULSATING) JACK: Three, Plan A is only as good as your Plan B. (BANGS AND MUFFLED YELLS OUTSIDE THE DOOR) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SUSPENFUL MUSIC) (MEN GROANING) (ALARM PULSATING) All right, uh... down the stairs, out the back door. (ALARM PULSATING) (ISABELLA GRUNTS, SOUND OF A KICK) (UPBEAT SUSPENSUL MUSIC) Hey! Oh, shit. (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) Let's go, let's go, let's go! (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) (BULLETS ARE HITTING THE VAN) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BULLETS ARE FLYING BY AND HITTING THE VAN) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) - What the hell happened? - Our network was hacked. Think it was a setup? (SIGHS) It felt off in there. There's how things are, and there's how things appear to be. Trust your gut next time. Yeah, well, whatever went wrong, we need to figure it out, but we have bigger issues to deal with. We gotta get ahead of this mess. Yeah and off the streets. (SIGHS) Iggy, take us to Rumble's HQ. - You sure? - We have no choice. Copy that. (TENSE DREAMATIC MUSIC) (ECHOED LIGHTER FLICKING ) (LIGHTER CLICKING) Darius Emanuel Grouch... The Third. better known as... The Rumble. (LIGHT THUNDER RUMBLING) I am very disappointed. The painting wasn't there, someone knew we were coming. Warhol, De Kooning, Pollock, bunch of bitches. How about I just blow your brains out, I'll create my own damn Pollock! Now Asgar Jorn, the "Disturbing Duckling." That's modern art, and now I'm disturbed, Jack. You a gambling man, Jack? Not anymore. Once a gambling man, always a gambling man. You bet everything you had. You had a 50-50 shot, Jack. Toss of a coin. One side, in a split second, you make enough money to retire. You, your crew, your family... live the life they always dreamed of. On the other side, you lose... everything. My, how everything can change in just a second. You trusted your gut, Jack, and it lied to ya. And I've paid for it ever since. You owed a lot of money to some very bad people. I'm not just a businessman, I'm an opportunist. So I bought your debt. I own you. Now you're gonna have to repay me that debt. Those people would've killed ya. I saved you, resurrected you from the ashes! Now, you have to be able to trust those who work for you. Can I trust you, Jack? You know you don't have to ask me that. Then where the hell is my painting? If I had my damn painting, we wouldn't be having this conversation, now would we? Since you didn't bring me my $40-million painting, I'm gonna need you to pay me back... with interest. Can we just get to the job? Good man, Jack, good man. There is a legend in the underworld, for those in the know, it's the called the Money Plane. Some of the baddest mother fuckers on the planet are on that plane, all craving action, whatever you wanna wager on, the Money Plane has you covered. You wanna bet on a dude fucking an alligator... Money Plane. Untouchable by any government, because the flight always takes place in international airspace. Word is they have over a billion in crypto onboard, and millions in cash. I want you and your crew to take down the house. No, no, you got to be kidding me, right? Do I look like I'm joking? Now I'm gonna be fronting you the money for the buy in, and I'm arranging cover stories for you and your crew to get on board undetected. This is bat-shit crazy, Darius. We can't do it. No, what's crazy is I don't have my painting, yet you're here talking to me, still very alive. Look familiar? (TENSE SOMBER MUSIC) You're more valuable to me alive, for now. That's the only reason, Jack. You don't bring me back what I want from the Money Plane, and you won't have anything to come back to. Do you understand me? I..If we pull this off, and... DARIUS: Uh... Not "If". "When" you pull this off! When we pull it off, that's it, we're square. And not just me, but my entire crew. We're done! Yeah, we're square. P-Roach. This bag has everything you need. All the details, the money I'm fronting you, everything. And - as a little incentive to you, You and your crew can keep whatever's left in the vault. (TENSE MUSIC) Now go get me my money, Jack. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Have a safe flight. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ANNOUNCEMENT BLARING) JACK: This is the last one, I promise. TREY: Hey, what happened to the last, last one? Well, we didn't complete the job, did we? It's not our fault the painting wasn't there! Hey, let's stay focused. What's the job? We are going to rob the Money Plane. It's an airborne casino, chartered by a bunch of elite criminals, who bet on all kinds of crazy shit. It operates over international airspace, but, apparently, it has $1-billion in cryptocurrency. - And we're gonna steal it? - Yeah. It's insane! Yeah. I love it! And how do we do this? I'm going to take on the persona of a Mr. Phillip Monroe, he's an infamous human trafficker, but he did all of his business digitally, so nobody knows what he looks like. Well, what happened to the real Monroe? It seems Isabella had a run in with Mr. Monroe last June in Moscow. (MOTORCYCLE ENGINE GROWLING) (TENSE ROCK MUSIC) Oh. Now Trey, I need you to go undercover, you're gonna be my right hand on the plane. Copy that. JACK: Isabella, you're gonna be on board as well posing as a flight attendant, I got your cleared credentials already. What about me, Jack? What do I do, who am I? You, Iggy, you're gonna be my main man on the ground. You're gonna be managing all the hardware, and basically controlling everything. What, tech support? That's Trey's job! I know, but I need Trey on board with me. JACK: Now, there's no security cameras actually on the plane, so we're gonna use that to our advantage. Once on the plane, we create a diversion, so I can sneak off, and take control of the cockpit. (SLOW SMOOTH MUSIC) Trey will represent me, while Isabella searches for the vault, and the server room. Once located, Isabella will open the vault. (LOCK SPINNING) (DOOR CREAKING) Trey will sneak in the server room, and hack the server. From there, you're gonna transmit the key for the house crypto wallet, and create an untraceable relay to our main man, Iggy. Ground support, what a shit job. JACK: Iggy, you're gonna be awaiting my signal. Once we're in range, you're gonna be on the receiving end of over a $1-billion in cryptocurrency. Can you handle that? Yeah, I got it covered. Once you've given us the signal that you've received the transfer, then the three of us will go down to the cargo hold where we will parachute out, with all of the money we took from the vault. We'll be gone before anybody knows what happened. Memorize your files. Short prep time on this job. JACK: Get a good night's rest. If we do this right, we can take care of our families, and move wherever the hell we want. We depart day after tomorrow, 0500. (PENSIVE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JACK GROWLING) JACK: Oh! (LAUGHS) Ooh. Direct shot. Oh!!! I don't fight fair! CLAIRE: I quit your team, and start my own! JACK: That's not fair, I'm gonna hit you good. - There, I got one in. - I have a shield. MOM: All right you two! It's bedtime. Come on Mom, already? Yes honey, you got to go to bed. JACK: Yeah, it's bedtime sweetie, go get washed up. I'll be up for a story soon, okay? - But Dad, just five more... - No buts. (JACK SIGHING) (SARAH SIGHING) I can't believe you have to leave on such short notice. I know, no one's more upset about it than I am. CLAIRE: Dad, I'm waiting! - (JACK CHUCKLING) - All right dad, it's story time. - We'll pick this up later. - Yeah we will. (UPTEMPO GUITAR MUSIC) JACK: And all was well in Sherwood Village. For now. So, it's okay to steal if it's someone bad? Well, I mean they would have to be really bad. So, I can steal all of Harriet's candy, because she is mean to everyone? (CHUCKLES) I'm sure that Harriet is a tyrant, but if you stole and ate all the candy, well, then you'd get sick, so wouldn't it be nicer if you shared it? 'Night sweetie. (JACK SIGHING) SARAH: You okay? Yeah, of course, just thinking. She's amazing, isn't she? Yeah, she is amazing. Well, come to bed, babe. (WIND RUMBLING) DARIUS: You owe a lot of money to some very bad people... (LIGHTER CLICKING WITH ECHO) (LOW RUMBLE) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) DARIUS: I saw an opportunity, so I bought your debt. Now you work for me. To repay your debt, I need you and your crew to take down the house. Now... ...go get me my money, Jack. (DARIUS LAUGHING) (TRUCK ENGINE WHOOSHING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR UNLATCHING) Oh Jesus. I almost shot you. I almost shot you! (SIGHING) Did you pick the lock? No, Claire told me where the spare was. Why do you keep movin' it? Because you keep using it. Remind me again, why did you make me your daughter's godfather? That was Sarah's idea. Ah. Well, come on in. (CAT MEOWING) Shhh! (LIGHTER FLICKING) I got that intel you wanted. Thanks, Harry. It's suicide, you know that, right? It's the last one. Oh, where have I heard that one before? Listen, I got no choice. I haven't gambled in five years, since I got my team into this mess. Gambling was never your problem. You know, in the beginning you were betting on your skill, not your luck. You were the best, one of the best, at any poker table anywhere. Then you got greedy. But when you lost, when you lost big, best thing that ever happened to you. What? We got you back. Sarah got her husband back, I got my best friend back. But make no mistake, Jack, you got great instincts. You need to trust 'em, stop second-guessing yourself. Ever since I lost that hand, don't know if I can. It's ironic, isn't it. Gambling is what got you into this whole mess, and now, the Money Plane. Casino in the sky. Full of the world's most dangerous criminals. You sure know how to pick 'em, pal But hey, if anybody's gonna pull it off, it's gonna be you... you and your crew. Heck, might even be a good time. I doubt that. But maybe I can convince you to come with us anyway? Nope (PUFFS). Not this time, buddy. I got this thing about planes. (JACK CHUCKLES) Coming from the youngest major general in the United States Air Force. Hell, I would've made Lieutenant if I didn't quit to run around the world with you. Agh... Feels like a... (SIGHING) another life! But someday, I'd love to get back in the cockpit again, and fly around the world, kick ass... Well, here's your chance! Another life. Listen, uh... may I ask you a favor? Sure. Be my backup guy on the ground? Stay here at the house. Look after the girls... I'd owe you one. Okay. Anything for my goddaughter, right? And I'm gonna look into this museum job too. Something seems off about that, but hey, anything goes wrong up there, I'm a phone call away. Thanks pal.

Now, human trafficking is the third largest criminal enterprise, right behind drugs, and my personal favorite, arms dealing. Touche. We met once. Digitally. Mr. Vertelli, we know who you are. You're the infamous arms dealer who supplied Iran with materials to become nuclear capable. You've got me figured out, Kemosabe. But you were already on the FBI's most wanted list for selling chemical weapons in Syria. Thousands of women and children suffered. And here's the kicker, the Syrian government tried me, and I was acquitted by the United Nations, which makes me an innocent man. Put a lot of bodies in the ground in your way to the top. Look, my granddaddy sold guns, my daddy sold guns, I sold my first weapon before I lost my virginity. Now, I'm sellin' nuclear weapons. Living the American dream, now who the fuck is this guy? - I'm Mr. McGillicuddy. - Well Mr. McGillicuddy, I'm willing to assume if some of the women and children, that you harvest, were armed by me, there'd be quite a few less people trapped in forced labor, wouldn't there be? Gentlemen, anything to drink? Gin. I'm good. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Is this gonna be a thing between you two? You seem to like it. Is it really necessary? More than 50% of of your victims are sexually exploited, and you've got a problem with my guy hitting on a waitress? Come on. I just wanna play some poker, that's all. Drinks gentlemen? (PUNCH THUDDING) (STEWARD SCREAMING) (IVAN) Round one to Reid. Mr. Vertelli, keep your dog on a leash. You will not be warned again. All right, everybody calm down. Let's play some cards.

(JR) You know, at first I thought to myself, that's a brave man, then I realized, Mister...? McGillicuddy. McGillicuddy? A fine Irishman. And I realized, Mr. McGillicuddy, that's not a brave man, he has a secret. That is a man, who's ready to die. (CARTRIDGE SPINNING) Ready to meet his maker, ready for what comes next, because you have placed yourself tonight at this table across from JR Crockett himself, and that I, JR Crockett, never lose. I can't lose, I can't be beat. No shit, or he wouldn't be here boring us to death with this speech. Your blindfold, sir. You will be playing first. 20 to one odds, any takers on 20 to one odds? 20 to one odds, ladies and gentlemen, 20 to one odds. Give me a cool million at 20 to one - on the Irishman. - As you wish.

Sir, as the challenger, you are obliged to go first. Rules are rules. But the man wants to go first, let the man go first. The man is just offering a kind gesture, the rules of the game are clear. - I wanna to see the book! - I am the book. Oh goddammit, give me the fucking gun. I can't lose.

Pack up the money, you cover your tracks, get the hell out of there, stay alert. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (ISABELLA SIGHING) Line secure, what's up? So, something seemed off about that botched museum job, right? So I did some digging. You were supposed to steal a painting for Darius Grouch. Now, "The Disturbing Duckling" is a privately owned piece of art, the name on record is some company called Bon Global. Now, Bon Global is owned by Rumble Corp. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Why would he have you steal a painting he already owns? There's more, the painting was transferred out of the museum the night before the heist. Museum was tipped. That sounds like a setup to me. Do we know where the painting really is? Sure, currently on display at the Palazzo Braschi in Rome. I'll call you back. We can't take it all, it's too much money in that safe. Packed what I could, one bag each. It's all the weight we can jump with safely. - Copy that. - Server's across the hall. - All right. - Bravo, Delta, copy. We read you. Listen, we all knew this wasn't right, but now I know for sure. Museum was a set up. - I knew it. - What do we do? (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) We proceed with the plan, we're in too deep. We've got to get out of this mess without getting double crossed again. Just be careful, be vigilant, stay alert. Stay alive. This mission just got even more fucked up. I've been gone too long. I've got to get back, someone's gonna get suspicious. Good call, I better make an appearance too. Let's make it quick. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) All right, you take wine. (TENSE OMINOUS MUSIC) (LAPTOP DINGING) (MAN GRUNTING) Don't you piss, you hear me? Don't you piss yourself. Stay right there, I've got to take this. - Yeah. - Hey, it's me. Code names, please. Colonel, this is Captain. Captain, this is Colonel, I read you loud and clear. What's up (HUSHES). I'm informing you we have found and accessed the vault. We're still searching for the server. Good, good, you keep checking the boxes, Captain. That museum job that went wrong. We're working on it, why do you ask? Well, I wanna find the son of a bitch who set us up. Yeah, well, we don't have anything yet, but if we do, I'll let you know. Not if, when. When we find out something, I'll let you know. Please do, my crew and I'll do that job for free. - Be in touch, over and out. - Yeah, yeah, over and out. - (MAN GRUNTING) - Jesus, can't hear myself think, will you shut this guy up? (GUNSHOT BOOMING) (BODY THUDDING) What the fuck did you do? I told you shut him up, not shoot him. You fucked up my terracotta. This stuff is porous, don't you get that? For God's sake, son of a bitch. It's never gonna come out, it's gonna stain. (AIRPLANE WHOOSHING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Hello. - Harry, what's going on? Jack, I'm training. I'm sending you an encrypted message with some schematics for a fail safe. Got a bad feeling about this, things are going south. I need you, remember Brazil? Oh boy, do I remember Brazil. What happened to Brazil? You're on a need-to-know basis, soldier. Jack, trust your gut. We need to move on to Plan B. Roger that. (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) I got to take a break, kid. Don't eat all my M&M's, okay (GRUNTS). Let's see. All right you sons of bitches, let's do it. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DEVICES BEEPING) I knew there was something wrong with this guy. I told you. (CELLPHONE DINGING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) JACK: Charlie, we are inbound with rally point location, are you up and running? Alpha, green light, sync on standby, ready to rock. Delta, how's it coming? Great, we're just about there with the sync And got it! Transfer in progress. Transfer and download in progress. Alpha, keep us in target range. All right everyone, keep it up! 44%. Transfer's at 44%, I repeat 44%. Gentlemen, I'm gonna have to ask you to return to the upper deck. (BOTH LAUGHING) You take care of the princess, and I'll take care of this guy. With pleasure. You really wanna do this? Okay then, bitch. Here comes daddy. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? Who me? Yeah., you stole that cookie. Listen, it's not what it looks like. (HEELS CLANKING) - I like that. - Love it. - You like? - Love it. (BONE CRACKING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (REID GRUNTING) (REID PANTING) (PUNCH THUDDING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (BONE CRACKING) Ivan, I can explain. (PUNCHES THUDDING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GLASS SHATTERING) (IVAN CHEERING) Halfway there. (PUNCHES THUDDING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (LAPTOP DINGING) Alpha, come in, transfer stopped. (AIRPLANE WHOOSHING) I can't keep the plane in range any longer. We're gonna have to make another pass. - Delta? - Alpha? What the hell's going on up there? (TREY COUGHING) I don't wanna be late before the next card game, but I got to kill ya. (ISABELLA KNOCKING) Hi Princess. (IVAN GRUNTING) (IVAN SCREAMING) (SERVER BUZZING) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (GUNS COCKING) Drop the gun, drop the gun, drop the gun. - Get up, get up! - Get him up, get him up. Get him up, get him up. Alpha, abort, I'm sorry. Bravo, Delta, do you copy? - Sit rep. - Get up. What took you so long? I was organizing my closet. Alpha, do you copy, I'm with Delta. Everything's fine. (SIGHS) speak for yourself. We're out of range, and the server's been damaged. Charlie's been compromised. Darius did it again, he set us up. Solution? We do not let him win. Listen, can you reboot the server? Download it onto a portable SSD? If it's stable enough to handle the transfer. But the moment the drive boots via USB, their security software will tip them off, they'll know there's a breach. Do it, we're out of options. But they'll be able to trace it back to us. Not us, we have a Plan B. (BOTH) Plan B. (TABLET DINGING) Okay, ladies and gents, here comes Harry. (DRONE DINGING) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (DRONE WHIRRING) Who's next? (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (IGGY SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (GUARD GRUNTING) Stay still, you bastard. (DRONE WHIRRING) Come on, I'll tear one right up your ass. And. (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) sucks to be you, pal. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey Harry. Hey pal, how're ya doing? (LAPTOP DINGING) Hello, who's this? What do you mean who's this? Please hold. (SLOW RELAXING MUSIC) (JACK WHISTLES) Who're you holding for again? Need I remind you who you work for? I've been up here, above the clouds, I don't know, it's given me some perspective. I've been thinking, what if I don't work for you? What if you were actually just a little bitch? And what if this money wasn't actually yours anymore? Are you really fucking with me right now? Are you fucking with me? You think you're bad ass, yeah? The criminals on this plane would eat you alive. On this plane, you're a dime a dozen, Colonel. I don't give a fuck who's on that plane. I'm the baddest mother fucker on the planet! I am Darius Grouch the Third, The Rumble, and I am taking down the Money Plane. - Now bring me my money. - Please hold on. (SLOW RELAXING MUSIC) Time to burn down the village. (KNIFE GRINDING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SPAGHETTI TAPPING) (WATER BOILING) (DOOR SQUEAKING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) Fuck. (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) goddammit. Ow. (GUN COCKING) (PLANE WHOOSHING) Speed and altitude decreased, auto-pilot engaged. Transfer complete, with the key to access all the cryptocurrency. - Over $1-billion. - And the clock is ticking. It's only a matter of time before they figure out they've been hacked. Leave that to me. Now that we have the funds, what's next? Let's redistribute the wealth. We can donate it to anonymous charities worldwide. Untraceable, non-reversible. We'd be giving the money back to those who suffered at the hands of these bastards. UNICEF, Polaris, uh, refugees of Syria, you name it. TREY: A little steal from the rich? ISABELLA: And give to the poor. JACK: Exactly. You sure about this, what about your debt to Darius? I told you, I have a Plan B, do it. (CELLPHONE DINGING) A whole lot of people just got a whole lot of money. What about the cash? I don't want it, split the money. The same here. Me neither. Let's spread the wealth manually. Got a call to make. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey. I hope you have come to your senses! Any good job has three critical parts. First, you need a great team. It takes more than one flint to start a fire. Second, you need a proper diversion. There's the way things are and the way things appear to be and the SSD that has the access key to the cryptocurrency, we thought it'd be better served if we dispersed that digitally to charities around the world that are dealing with horrible issues, like, I don't know, human trafficking. You're dead, your families are all dead, you, your crew, and everyone you ever met. Dead by the time you touch down. Lastly, if there's no Darius, there's no debt. Always have a Plan B. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) DARIUS: I don't give a fuck who's on that plane, I'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet. I am Darius Grouch the third, The Rumble, and I am taking down the Money Plane. Now bring me my money. On behalf of the house, I wanna assure you that Mr. Grouch's head will be on a platter by the time we land. The House will compensate any lost funds. Let's have a new wager. Who wants to wager how long it'll take 'til we get notice of Mr. Grouch's death? 15 minutes at 50,000. Very nice. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) We just did that. First time for everything. We never did get that painting. Well, I guess we have one last, last job to do. Payback's a bitch. You ready? Let's strap in. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LEVER CREAKING) (AIR WHOOSHING) An eye for an eye, Colonel. I got to jump. (CELLPHONE BUZZING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DARIUS PANTING) (DARIUS GRUNTING) (TABLE THUDDING) When we pull it off, we are done. Yeah, we're square. (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) now, go get me my money, Jack. (TRACKER THUDDING) I'm out, Darius. Hold on, P-Roach. Hold on. Okay. (GUNS COCKING) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) Rumble time. (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (DARIUS SCREAMING) (TENSE TRADITIONAL MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (UPTEMPO RELAXING MUSIC) - (CELLPHONE RINGING) - Hello? My source has an offer on your painting. It seems the publicity from the heist drove the price up to 60 million. Split four ways, not a bad retirement. We'll split five ways. See you in Paris. All right. What are you doing (LAUGHS)? - (TOY SQUEAKING) - I know, you're so silly. What are you doing (LAUGHS)? It's your turn now (LAUGHS). (UPTEMPO RELAXING MUSIC) (TENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC)
