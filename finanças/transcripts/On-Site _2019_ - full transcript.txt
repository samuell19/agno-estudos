Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? Tinseltown Villa Apartments, this is Lisa, can I help you? This is Lisa, may I help you? Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? Tinseltown Villa Apartments. Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? This is Lisa, may I help you? - Yep. Any day between 11 and six. Nope, you don't need an appointment. Right, every day. 11 until six o'clock. Yep, we're open on Sundays too, until six. No, you don't need an appointment. Even on a Sunday. Yeah, we're open today until six. Well, if you just come to the building, we'll be happy to show you, you know, when we have one. The singles usually go for 1,595. No, I'm sorry. They don't negotiate on the unit price. Well, I'm sorry, but- Hello? Yes, Ginny. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Just living the dream. - Are you busy? - Not any more than usual. - If you're busy, I can come back. - Stop. You stop. How is your day going? - It's just another beautiful, sunny California day, Ginny. - Cool. Cool. Cool. - So? What's up? - Oh, I'm so late. I gotta go walk the dog. - You're supposed to be walking the dog right now? - Yeah, if I'm not at Karen's at exactly one, Snickers pees inside. - It's 10 after one. - I know, I'm so late. - So do you think Snickers is peeing right now, or is the one time that he holds it? - She? - Sorry, she. I gotta get that, Ginny. - Oh, hey, okay. Good talk. - Good talk. - Woo. - Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, can I help you? Sure, I'll buzz you in. - Oh, sorry. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm the on-site manager, Lisa. - Claire. This is my husband, Will. - Hi, Lisa. - Hi. - We're here to see the one-bedroom. - We actually don't have any one-bedrooms to show right now. - Oh, it said online that you did. - Yeah, sorry, sometimes they forget to pull the old ads. We're remodeling some units, though. We should have one available by the first. - You don't have anything you can show us today. - We're only in town from Texas for the weekend, and so we're hoping to get something locked down for his work ... it starts on the fourth. - Well we definitely will have something available by then. - Okay, how much? - The one-bedrooms are usually 1,895. - That's within our price range. - Moving's the worst. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's a nightmare. - You know what? Let me just give you a card. And that way, if you don't find anything, you can always call us back. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. Have a seat. What kinda work do you do? - Systems analyst. - His office is just down the street from here. And we were hoping to get somewhere close because of traffic. We only have one car. Anywhere close or decent is so expensive. - That's LA for you. What about you, Claire? What kinda work do you do? I'm an actress. I know it's cliche, but, small town girl coming to LA to make it big. - Well if you're a cliche then I'm an absolute stereotype. I'm guilty of the same thing. Hence the job peddling apartments. - Is it really as difficult as everyone says? - What? You've heard that? No no no, it's super easy. I just, I love doing this instead of spending my millions. No, you know I've done a few small things. I have a manager and stuff, but it's work. But, you know, if you have a good support network and a little bit of talent, it's not that bad. - See, honey? It's easy. You have a little bit of talent, and I support you. She's my retirement plan, so don't discourage her. - Your secret's safe with me. All right, yeah, so here's my information. Like I said, we're definitely gonna have something available by the time you're looking to move. And no BS, they're actually really nice one-bedrooms. I kinda lucked into this gig when we first moved here, but even if I didn't get free rent, I would still live here. - You get free rent? Wow, that must be so perfect for your acting. - I'm not gonna lie. It's a pretty sweet deal. All right, we're gonna take a look at some other places. If we don't find anything, we'll give you a call. - Great. - Thanks. - Oh, you know what? Let me just get you some applications. That way, if you get home and you decide that you're interested here, we can always just do it by fax and that way you're locked in, ready to move. They're pretty self-explanatory. - Thank you. - Sure. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Good luck in your search. - Lisa is sad. Lisa is sad. Lisa is sad. Lisa is sad. Lisa is sad, goddammit. Lisa is getting angry. Lisa is sad. Where did you go? Where did you fucking go? You could have stayed. You should have stayed. But you don't have the courage, do you? You fucking piece of shit, you fucking cowardly fuck. Fuck you! I should have killed us both. I should have killed us both. But you don't have the courage, do you? To die? To stay forever like you promised? Lisa is happy. Lisa is happy. Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? Yeah, sure, I remember you, Claire. Yeah, they're coming through now. - Hi, Lisa. - That's really nice. Yeah, I got a good feeling from you guys, too. Yeah, it'll definitely be ready by the first. Okay, great, well, I'm gonna run these, and then I'll let you know on an approval as soon as possible. Okay. Okay. All right, bye. - I'm sorry to bother you. Are you busy, Lisa? I'm so sorry. - I'm about to be busy running some applications. - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's all right. What's up? - No, I can come back. - Ginny, you can stop apologizing. - Okay. Sorry. Sorry. - What do you need? - It's Wallace. You now, Wallace, my cat? - Yeah, how's young Wallace doing these days? I can't find him. - What do you mean? - I think he got out. - Outta your apartment? - Yeah. But I don't know how. He doesn't know how to survive outside. I'm sure he's probably just hiding somewhere in your apartment. - No! I looked. - Okay ... just calm down. - Well, what am I gonna do? I raised him since he was a baby. He doesn't know how to do anything outside of the apartment. - It's okay, just calm down, Ginny. - No, he needs his shots. - What? - Wallace suffers from anxiety. The vet gave him pills, but he won't take them, so I have to give him injections twice a day. - That ... fits. You know what? I wouldn't worry. He couldn't have gotten far. - You think he's okay? - Yeah, I'm sure he's just ... somewhere in the building. - But what if he gets hungry? - Well then he'll come out looking for food, and when he does, we'll find him. - Are you sure? - Well, no, but I usually have a pretty good feeling about these things. - No, you have to find him! - No, I don't. But I'll do what I can to help, all right? - Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay. I know you're upset. Why don't you go upstairs, and maybe he'll come back? - You think he will? - Well I know if you're not up there when he does, then he can't come in. - You're right. - Whoa. - Will and Claire Winston are moving in today, a lovely couple, a lervely, lovely, lovely? Lovely. A lovely couple from Texas. Maybe I'll invite them around for some iced tea next time I see them in the garage. Tinseltown Villa Apartments. This is Lisa, may I help you? Hey, Will. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Yeah, no, those are supposed to be in your apartment already. Yeah. No no no, no, it's no problem, yeah. I'll bring you some right now. - Sorry, Lisa, we really weren't trying to be a pain or anything. - No, no, it's my fault. These are actually supposed to be in the apartment when you move in. - Thank you, lifesaver. I got first shower. - Well chivalry's clearly dead. - I mean, you can join if you want to. Overshare? - Sorry about him. He had a few beers before we- - No I get it, new apartment, gotta christen it. - See? She gets it. And besides, California's always in a drought, right? We could all shower together and save some water. Welcome to the Left Coast, man. I'm all for it. - Will? - Yeah, I'll be in the shower if you need me. - Okay, I think that's more than enough for now. Thank you for bringing the rod, and sorry about my crude husband. - If this is the worst thing I'm gonna have to deal with from you guys, I think we're gonna get along just fine. - Okay. Well, um. - Cool. - Wait, Lisa, actually, I was wondering, and feel free to say no if it's totally out of line, but I was wondering, since you're like the only actual actor I know here in Hollywood, if we could like sit down sometime and I could pick your brain for some advice. - Fuck no. - Okay, no, sorry. I just. - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm so sorry. - Oh my God. - I couldn't help it. Yeah, of course, I'm happy to help any way I can. - Jesus Christ, that was. - Yeah. Any time, yeah, I'm free tonight actually, if you wanna stop by later. - Tonight may not be great with the whole like getting settled. - Moving, sorry, yeah. - That's okay but ... tomorrow maybe. - Yeah, definitely. Just let me know, I'm free whenever, so. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah, what are friends for? Cool. Oh, you bring the wine, though, right? Yeah, happy to. - Well, that was embarrassing. - Aw, she didn't think so. - Do you still have room for me? - I thought that you were too embarrassed. - I was embarrassed. But like she said, we still have to christen this place properly. I knew there's a reason I loved you. - Who do we have here? Young Wallace, I presume? Hm, how'd you get in here. Ginny's been terribly distraught. Yeah. You've been a very, very naughty kitty. Very naughty. - Okay, Lisa, I've finished everything. - Okay. Oh, we need more shower curtain rods. I gave the last one to 413. - Oh, there's none downstairs in the storeroom? - Mm-mm, just the usual crap down there. I went and checked. Which we should probably get that junk out, by the way. That stupid barrel's been down there since I moved in. - Yeah, you know, they came to redo the elevator shaft and they left that like 10 years ago. - Right, so we should probably haul it away, right? - Mm. - Mm. - Okay. I'll be in Lankershim. You know, coming up to get ready for the inspection there. - Right, how long's that gonna talk. - Ooh, don't know but they say we have to retile everything and all that before the city comes. Ay, Madre. - Okay, so what if we have maintenance issues? - Talk to Ted, but you know he's got me and Luis and Pancho all there. He say you don't have apartment, so you don't need me for a month at least. He say. - Yeah, we've only got 100 apartments. What could possibly go wrong in a month? - Okay. I'll see you, Lisa. - Have a good night. - Holy shit, Claire. - You don't want salad? - Of course I do. Thank you, by the way. But you haven't been outside lately, have you? - No, why? - Because there's a whole fucking scene happening down at the front door. - Details. - Okay, so, I'm making my way up to the front, right? - Right. - I see like, two cop cars, a firetruck, an ambulance. - Holy crap. - Yeah, then all of sudden there's this woman, just like screaming and yelling. I mean, just completely losing her shit. I know, right? So, as I'm making her way up, I see her and she's just like, the cops are trying to calm her down to get her on the stretcher, but she's just ranting and raving, and I mean kicking at them like a fucking lunatic. - Seriously? - Yeah. Dead serious. She was just like fucking yelling at them. - Well what was she saying? - All I could make out between the sobs was, my cat, my cat. And she yells out the name Wallace right as they tied her down to the stretcher. - Oh, geez. - Fucking crazy. Well, how was your day? - Well, clearly not as exciting as yours. - Don't get ahead of yourself. I spent the rest of my morning at work. - It's only your first day. How can you be like that? - What can I say? It's work. It's meetings and cubicles and ... work. - You make it sound so awful. - That's my way, babe. Which is why I'd rather hear more about you, beautiful. So, do tell. - Oh, well, if you must know. I did some yoga after you left, and then I went for a walk, got some coffee, took a look around the neighborhood. And- - Did you find anything good? - No psychotic ravings about their cat, if that's what you mean. - Feel safer already. - Right? Oh, I submitted for some auditions before coming back here and making lunch. - And? - And what? - Did you get anything good? - It's Day One, honey. - So? - So, it doesn't work like that. - It might. - It doesn't. But I am meeting with Lisa later, and we're gonna learn how to hopefully speed up the process. - Nice. - Yeah. - Hey, try to figure out the story of the cat lady. - Oh, you can guarantee, that'll be the first on my list of questions. - Coming. - Hey. - Hey. Is now still a good time? Yeah, yeah, come in. - Oh, wow. - Yeah, sorry about the mess. - No, I meant, wow, this is so different from our place. - Oh yeah. The remodeled units are really different, but the manager before me was here for like 20 years, so ... kind of one of a kind now. - I really like it. - Thanks. - Oh my God, is that you? Oh, it's from a film I shot. I swear, I don't just sit around watching myself all day. - My God, that is so awesome. Can I see? - Um ... it's just that it's not done yet, so. - No, I didn't, sorry. - No, it's okay, I just, I just haven't had a chance to see how bad I am yet. - Come on. - You never know. I'm serious. Okay ... you want something to drink? - Oh, as promised, I brought the wine. - Oh. Fancy. Have a seat. - Oh, Will said there was something about, there was something outside today with the police. Oh, Wallace. One of our tenant's cat died, and she was really upset about it. - Wait, her cat died, and she had to be restrained in a stretcher? - Yeah, she's got ... issues. Bless her heart, you know what, I probably shouldn't be talking about it. - No, oh, I don't wanna pry if you can't talk about it. - Don't leave me, please don't leave me, please don't. - It's fine. I can probably tell you about it if you just promise not to, like, share it around. - No, totally. I won't say anything, but who do I know besides you anyway? Oh, Wallace. - All right, I'll trust you. But if you tell anybody, I'm gonna have to kill you. So, her name is Ginny. And she takes ... a lotta medications, just to get through her day. And by a lot, I mean like ... 30 different things. So when her cat died, I guess it just musta been too much for her. - Wallace, Wallace. Did she see it, get hit by a car or something? - No, nothing like that even. Ginny's just extremely sensitive to small changes. She's schizophrenic, paranoid, severe OCD, manic, all that. Manager. - So, okay, she comes into my office, she tells me that she thinks her cat is missing. So I tell her, you know, I'm sure it's probably just hiding or something. She tells me that she looked everywhere for it. I told her it was probably just under the bed, not to worry, that we'd let her know if we found anything. But, turns out it was just under her bed, the whole time. Yeah, I think the smell finally tipped her off. - Oh God. - Just goes to show you that ... sanity's a fragile thing. I lie on the floor, watched by nothing and hanging on. I cry at night. I'm afraid of hearing voices, or a voice. I have come to the edge of the land. I could get pushed over. Margaret Atwood. It's from her book Cat's Eye. You should check it out sometime. Anyway, enough talk about being crazy, let's talk about acting. Thought you said enough talk about being crazy. - Hey, there you are. Thought I was gonna have to send out a search party for you. - Sorry, honey. - Wait. Somebody's been in the wine, it tastes like. - I may have finished a bottle with Lisa. - A whole bottle? - It was a team effort. - How Hollywood of you, on a Monday afternoon. - When in Rome. - True. So what else did you learn on your Roman holiday? - Quite a lot, actually. Did you know that she spends a couple hours every day recording herself just to perfect her craft? - Really? - Mm-hmm. And then she'll wait a couple weeks, and then she'll go back and critique herself, always with the sound off, though. - I mean, I do the same thing. Granted it's just cellphone video of me masturbating, but I really find it helps my performance. - Strange you don't seem to be getting any better in bed. - Touche. So what other kinda pearls did she teach you? - Tons. Seriously, things I would not have even thought of. - Good. - Yeah. She's very nice. - Aw, somebody's got them a new friend. Stop it. - Seriously, I'm glad you guys are hitting it off. She seems like a pretty cool chick. - Yeah, and I invited her over for dinner this weekend, actually. - Ugh, speaking of dinner, I can't live on beer alone. Are you cooking something, or am I ordering in? - You're truly helpless without me, aren't you? - What? No, I'm not. I can easily dial the number to several different pizza places that deliver. - Oh, pizza does sound good. - Pizza it is. - Will, I forgot to tell you about the cat lady. - Oh yeah. Pizza first, then the cat lady. Tonight, on Before They Were Famous. - Will, no. Claire Winston, once a small town Texas girl, now a budding Hollywood starlet. - Stop. How does she prepare? What does she read? We have the exclusive interview. - Stop, no. Come on, honey. Your public needs you. I look so awful. A young woman wracked by self-doubt becomes a Hollywood icon. Today we go inside ... Claire Winston. - You know, people often ask me, Claire, how do you do it? That's exactly what our viewers are asking. - Do you really wanna know my secret? One word, Will. Just one word. Gluten-free. - Tune in next week for an episode of Where Are They Now featuring that kid from the movie in 1992? Yeah, that's a wrap. Will. - I love you, Claire Winston. What? - Do you really think I'll make it? - I have zero doubt that you're gonna be successful. - Why? - Because you're really fucking talented. - Yeah, maybe in honky tonk Texas, but this is LA. - Talent isn't regional, Claire. You either have it or you don't. And you have it. - I love you, Will Winston. - That'll do. Now give me some sugar. - Hey, how's it- Oh my God, Will, I am so sorry, oh my God. - It's okay. It's fine. - Did you get any on you? Oh, no no no. Drought prevention, right? Just saving water by showing in coffee. - I'll get it. God, I'm such an idiot. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. If I wasn't such a candy ass, maybe I wouldn't have jumped at the sound of your voice. - If only I had a nickel for every guy that jumped at the sound of my voice. - Oh yeah? Well I guess we gotta communicate via body language from now on then. - That's definitely one way to do it. - Or you could just agree not to sneak up on hapless dudes with coffee early in the morning. - That is probably safer. Fuck. - I gotta get to work. - Yeah, sorry. - Hey, since you made me spill my coffee, you better bring some good beer or something when you come over for dinner. - Will do. - Oh my God. - No, Claire, no. You think this is easy for me? Lisa is good. Lisa is good. Don't fuck it up. - No, I didn't like her take on it. - I just felt like she looked really fat in her skirt. - I'm sorry, they said to just come in. - Of course, please. - Head shot, resume? - Yeah, right here. - Lisa Rybicki. Polish? - I'm sorry. Are you Polish? - Yeah, my last name is. - Do you speak it? - Polish? - Yes. - No. I think my family's been in the US for generations. - Who are you repped by, Lisa? - I'm actually in between management at the moment. - All right, Lisa, you'll be reading with Clio today. You can start it. Okay, if you can start with your name, the role you're here for and who you're repped by. - Hi, Lisa Rybicki, reading for the role of Gemini. Self submission, I guess. And action. - Fucking idiot. You're a fucking stupid piece of shit. Stupid. You have no talent. Everybody hates you, and you're never gonna be anything. Lisa is happy. - Claire? Claire? Claire? Claire? Will? In winter with warm tears, I'll melt the snow. And keep eternal springtime on my way. Lisa. - Hey. Sorry I missed your call. I was just leaving you a note, telling you to drop by whenever. What was so urgent? - Oh, well, since you're here, just come in. I'll tell you all about it. Okay. - So last night, I was submitting my head shots, through one of the websites that you showed me. - Uh-huh. - And this morning I got an email saying they wanna tape audition. - Oh, that's go great. - I know! I mean, it's just an audition. - No, it's a start. - I know, right? Oh my God. - So what do you need my help with? - Okay, this sounds really stupid, but I've never had to do a self-tape audition before. - Oh, you want me to help you do your self-tape? - Well, I mean, I got this tripod and stuff. And I could just set up my phone, but I was wondering if you could read with me. - Yeah. - I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to. It's totally okay. - Claire, stop, yes, I am happy to help you. - I can get Will to do it. - No, no, I'm happy to help. - Okay, thanks. - The Sides? What's the role? - Yeah. They did the in-person auditions today, but they liked my look enough. Said just see what I could do with it. I'm reading for Gemini. - Yeah. Okay, yeah. You definitely look right for the role, from what I see. They want it tomorrow by five, so I'm really gonna have to work my ass off to learn this tonight. - Well, I'm gonna let you get to it then. And then maybe we can meet up tomorrow afternoon to record it. - Thank you so much. - Yeah, you're welcome. Good luck. - Don't spill your coffee. It's just me. - Thanks for the warning this time. Hey, I thought one of the perks of being an actor was that you get to sleep in. What are you doing up so early? - Stalking you, obviously. - Well, it happens. - I'm only human. No, I do a building walk-through every morning just to ensure your personal safety. - My personal safety, huh? - Mm-hm, you ... and every other tenant in the building. - Here I was, thinking I was special. - Oh no, you are special. You are. - Be sure and tell my wife that, will you? - She needs some reminding? - Maybe. It's nothing. I think she's just stressing about this audition that she's got. - And? - And, I might have been a bit of a selfish asshole last night. - You, a selfish asshole? - You tell her I said that, and I'll kill you. - Careful, Will, you don't want me to have something like that on you. - Oh yeah? Oh yeah. - Women, incorrigible. - Aren't we just? - Anyway, will you help her do good on this audition so she's in a good mood when I come home? - Anything for you, Champ. - Careful, might hold you to that. - Maybe I'll hold you to that. - You are trouble. - Do I look okay? - Just hang on. Okay, look at me. You wanna do a practice one? - No, let's just go. - Okay. - You think this is easy? Do you think this is fucking easy for me, dressing this way and doing the things that I have to do every night? You don't have to do them. - Don't I? No. - Then who's gonna take care of you, of us, if I don't? Who's gonna pay for your school and put clothes on your back and food in your stomach if I don't go out and work at night? You know what I mean. - No, I don't. So please, tell me, tell me how we're gonna survive without the money that I make. You could do something else. You don't have to do that. - Don't you tell me what I have to do, when all I've known since Mom and Dad died is that I have to take care of you. Mom and Dad wouldn't want you to be a whore, Gemini, even for me. - Right, no, you're right. Maybe ... maybe I'm a whore, but someday maybe you'll realize that I only became a whore so that you never had to. Was that okay? - Shit, sorry, yeah. - Do we have to do it again? - No, that was awesome. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, you can do another one for safety, if you want, but that was, that was really good. - Seriously? - Yeah. You're good. Here, come here, come watch. - Hey! - Oh my God. - Got ya, didn't I? - Good one. - Oh. This looks fancy. What's the occasion? - We're having Lisa for dinner. - Interesting, looks like pasta to me. - Ah, those are for the hummus. - Just one. So? Still mad at me? - Depends. Are you still being a jerk? - Jerk? Come, come, you wasp... - No no, no no no, don't you try and Shakespeare your way outta this one with me, Mister. - No? What if I wanna compare you to a summer's day? Which is true. Thou art more lovely and more fair. - Words of so sweet breath composed, but since you are not Shakespeare, there's only one word I need to hear, Will. - Colostomy? - Gingerbread, perhaps. - Better, but no. - I don't even know what that means. - It means, I'm sorry. - You're forgiven. Now go get cleaned up before she gets here, okay? Will! - Just one more. - Lisa is pretty. Lisa is pretty. Lisa is pretty. - Stop. Stop. - No no, no no no, keep going. I wanna hear about my superstar in the making wife. - She was. I literally felt like there was a 20-year-old stripper trying to support her sister, just standing there in my apartment. She's gifted. Truly. - Thanks. But I couldn't have done it without you. Here here. Here's to me banging a 20-year-old stripper tonight. - Okay, don't be so crass. - No, here's to the producers recognizing true talent when they see it. - Ah. - You don't need any more, either. - Kill it. Wine police say I don't need any more of that. Love you, babe. So, Lisa. What's your story? What's a hot chick like you doing rolling... - Will Winston. - What? It's a legit question. - It's okay. - You don't have to answer that. - Unless of course you want to. - You don't. - It's totally okay. If you most know Mr. Nosy Pants, I was with someone recently. For a little over three years. - And? - And, it, just, sort of ended. - Well, you know, I'm sure you'll meet the right guy when you're ready. - Yeah. - That being said, I hate to leave you alone with this one, but nature calls. - Sorry if I was outta line. - You're fine. - Hey, you know what they say about getting over somebody, right? - No, Will, what is it they say? - The only way to get over somebody is to get under somebody else. - Oh. I'll keep that in mind. - Please do. Just don't tell Claire. She doesn't have the same kinda sense of humor about these things. - Oh, no. No need to worry. I'm good at keeping secrets. - Hey. How's my 20-something-year-old stripper? - Stop. - Come on, I can think of a lot better things to do than read right now. - You stop it. - What? - You know what. - Are you still upset about what I asked Lisa? Seriously? Claire, she doesn't care. She doesn't. - You know, just because she said that doesn't mean it's actually how she feels, Will. - Claire, you're a sweet girl, okay, which is why I love you so much but not everybody is as sensitive about shit like you. I didn't mean to say it like that. - What, like an asshole? - Claire. Look. - Seriously, what is it every time you get around her anyway? I mean, the comments and the innuendos and the flirting, how do you think that makes me feel seeing that? You know, and I know she doesn't like it. - Claire, you don't think I'd actually hurt you, do you? - I don't know. - Well, wait a second, you actually think... - You know what, you wait a second. In fact, why don't you just go sleep on the couch since I'm so sensitive about shit? - Claire. Seriously? Fine. Fuck it. - Will. - Hey. - Well good morning to you too, Sunshine. - Sorry. How's it going? - Why the long face? - It's a long story. You look like you're up to something fun and exciting this morning. - You have no idea. Do you think you could help me move something in the storage room really quickly? Please, it'll only take a second, I swear. - Yeah, sure. - Thanks, you're the best. Right this way. Aprez vous. It's right back there. Just this one thing. - What do you want me to do? - Die. - Fuck. Fuck! I'll fucking kill you. - Claire? Manager. Claire? Lisa. - Hey, you are here. - Yeah, what are you doing here? - Sorry, official manager stuff. The apartment above yours was complaining about a water leak, so I just came down to make sure it wasn't running down your walls or on your ceiling. I knocked, but you must not have heard me. - Yeah, I was sleeping, but we haven't had any problems. - Yeah, looks good. Anyway, sorry if I woke you up. Hey, let me know if you wanna grab coffee or something later this afternoon. - Yeah, maybe. Okay, take care. - Wow. - Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet.

Okay, okay, wait, slow down. Okay, yeah, I'll be right up. Lisa is happy. Oh my God, are you okay, what happened? - Have you seen Will today? - Yeah, I think I saw him going out of the front door when I was in the office this morning, why? - The front door? - Yeah, why, what happened? What is this? - Look at it. It looks like a credit card statement. - Yeah, from an account I've never seen before. - Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm just confused. Tell me what happened, honey. - Last night, Will and I got in a fight over something stupid, and I made him sleep on the couch. - Okay, that happens sometimes. - No, it's never happened with us. And then I get up this morning and then, you're here, but okay, whatever, fine, and then you leave and I got my tea and I checked my email and I got an email that I got the part. - What? - The role of Gemini, I got the part. - Oh my God, Claire, that's amazing. That's so amazing. - No, because then I found this. - I don't understand. What does that have to do with you getting the role? - Don't you see what's on here? There's lingerie, and there's jewelry and then there's plane tickets too. - It's okay, it's okay. - Will just, he found someone else and he just left me. - No, Claire, no. That didn't happen.

And his car's downstairs but he's not here, and you said you saw him leave. - Yeah, but I'm sure that doesn't mean. Claire, Claire, Claire. It's okay. It's okay, honey. It's okay. - I've lost him. - No, no, Claire. You did not. If he left, he's the one who's lost, do you understand me? Claire, Claire. You are kind and beautiful and smart and talented. A true artist. Anybody would be lucky to have you. I'm lucky to have you. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean, Claire. And if he left us together, it's for a reason. Claire. - I think you should go.

After everything I've done for you. After I let you have the role of Gemini, don't you fucking dare. I gave you a home. - Lisa, you're scaring me. - I'm scaring you. Why?

Now, before we go any further, by California law, I do need to inform you and have you sign a form acknowledging that you know that somebody did die in the apartment that you're renting within the last three years. - Are you serious? I'm afraid so. - That's really a law in California? Crazy but true. - How'd they die? You really wanna know? Well, they were a young couple, moved here from Texas so that she could pursue acting, much like you wanna do. And one morning, management needed to check on a building issue in their apartment, and she was lying there, stabbed in the chest. - Oh my God. - Did they know who did it? They suspect the husband because he disappeared the same day, but nobody's seen him since. Obviously, this is the first time anything like this has ever happened, but I am required by law to tell you. - What do you think, honey? - It's not haunted, is it? - Not that I know of. - Hey, everyone dies. Not everyone can get a one-bedroom at this price. Am I right? You'll have to forgive him. - Great, well that's it then. It's ready to move in whenever you guys would like. Oh, I totally forgot to get you a shower curtain rod. I'll get that this afternoon, okay? Welcome to Tinseltown Villa.
