Herre på täppan Once upon a time in a castle by the sea there lived a handsome prince. Well it wasn't really a castle, it was a chateu on the french riviera. And he wasn't really a prince, though people thought he was. Especially his victims. Please, your highness. Allow me to make this little contribution to your great cause. Even though these emeralds would mean freedom for many of my people, I can not accept them. But I beg you! Think what these can buy. The lives of men, women and tiny children. The men and women of my country would rather die than have their Prince accept charity. But for the tiny children ... I am eternally in your debt. Oh no, Your Highness, you don't know what a thrill it is for me... a mere commoner, to be this close to a prince. Arise fair lady, you're no longer a commoner. Your act of generosity has ennobled you. - Isn't it amazing! - What? Jewelry usually enhances a woman's beauty, but in your case the opposite is true. You're actually more beautiful without your necklace. - I am? - Yes, their artificial beauty... detracts from your natural beauty. It's incredible! Utterly fantastic! Madame, please no more. I beg you. For your own safety. Although his victims gave up priceless treasure... there was none but felt that it was a poor price to pay for such a glorious adventure. Meanwhile, in the forest surrounding a little German village there was a wolf. He prowled the countryside in search of victims. Like the prince, he too preyed only upon women. Guten tag. Bitte, helpe die me? - I speak English, corporal. - Oh, great. My German's coming back slowly. It's been so many years since my grandmother spoke it to me. Your "grandmutter" is German? Oh sure, she was born right here in this village. Matter of fact, that's why I'm here. I promised her I'd try to find the house where she was born. She gave me this old photograph. It is this house! Oh no! Come! Come look! See. Come! I'll show you the inside. - I don't wanna disturb your folks. - Oh I live here alone. Amazing. It's just like I was here before. It's exactly the way my grandmother described it. Look here, there's fireplace... and these wooden beams. Oh and the stained glass windows. And the little gold locket you're wearing. My grandmother had one exactly like it. She lost hers. But I told her I'd try to find one exactly like it for her. Ah, those stairs! Gee, I don't know how many times she told me about those stairs. - They lead straight up to the bedroom, right? - That is right! She used to tell me about that bed of hers, she said it was mattress filled with feathers. About that thick and so soft you just sink right into it. - What did she call it? - Ein federbett. - Oh yeah, ein federbett. - There's one up there now. - Oh, nothing can be that soft. - Come upstairs and see. - You mean you really sink down into it the way she said? - You can try it for yourself. Oh, the stories I'll have for granny when I get home. - Monsieur Jameson! - Good evening, inspector. She is the redhead in the gold dress. Fanny Eubank. Widow, Omaha. 36 years old. 24 million dollar. 35 carat necklace. 36/24/35. Perfect measurment. Großmutter, if luck is with me you'll get your operation. - That's your big operator? - It's the king. Buddy, we got officers who look better than him. All I know is he never misses. Well if his target is that blonde chick, he's gonna miss tonight... because she's the burgermeister's daughter and off limits to all service men. Care to make a little wager? Like a month's pay? You're on. Excuse me, would you ask the man if he could advance me a few marks on my ribbons? I'm sorry, he says no. Oh, what a beautiful locket. It was my grandmother's. She wanted me to give it to the girl I marry. But, if this man could... I wouldn't let you sell that. Here, allow me. Ah, I couldn't accept money from a woman. It's for your grandmother's operation. Thanks anyway, I just couldn't. She's an old lady and she's had a good life. My only regret is that she couldn't spend her last days here in her native land. - Your grandmother is German? - She was born right here, in this city. I've been trying to find the house. Here's an old snapshot. - This is the house where I live! - No! - Will you... see what you can get for this? - Not the royal ring, Your Highness. Fool. I told you never to call me that. Is my life of no value to you? Excuse me, is that man actually royalty? - No, madam. - But I heard you call him Your Highness. A faux pas, please forget it. You can trust me. I won't tell. Madam, I have already caused the Prince enough... He is royalty. And a Prince! He sounded like he was in trouble. Perhaps I can help, if you'll introduce me. If you really want to help, forget everything you have seen and heard. Forget the very existence of that Prince. Extraordinary man of destiny. Your Highness! Don't be alarmed, I can be trusted. - Are you one of my subjects? - No, I'm an American. Fanny Eubank of Omaha. I couldn't help overhearing. If you're in trouble and there's some way I can help. Thank you, dear lady. I have rarely seen beauty and compassion in one woman. But I can not accept. You have already risked too much just talking to me. - I have powerful enemies. - I still want to help. You are a rare woman! Beauty, compassion and now bravery. I can recall only three women in history who combine these qualities. Helen of Troy, Joan of Arc and Elizabeth of England. But now a fourth must be added. Fanny of Omaha. Fanny of Omaha! Please, you must tell me where he lives. You already know too much. Thanks to my stupidity. You mustn't blame yourself. It's in the stars. My horoscope said today I would meet a very special person. - I still feel guilty. - But you mustn't, it's all written in the stars. Who am I to fight such powerful forces? I feel it only fair to warn you, that there is an element of danger. Yes, he told me he has powerful enemies. I meant emotional risk. A lonely Prince and a beautiful woman... Are dangerous elements to bring together. - The Prince is lonely? - He has been a widower for five years. And so completely devoted to the cause of raising money to liberate his country. That he has even denied himself the emotional consolation of a woman's company. For five years? Come in. Come in! Surely you want to tell your grandmother you saw the inside of the house. I'd like to, but with your folks out of town I don't think I'd better. You are not at all like the other American soldiers. Yes, I take an awful lot of kidding about that. Won't you come in, just for a minute. I shouldn't. Not without your father here. Perhaps you're right. Come back tomorrow, Papa will be home. Alrighty. Thank you, good night. - What's the matter? - Nothing. It's just that I haven't eaten all day. I was saving all my money to gamble for grandmother's operation. You are not leaving this house until you are fed good, hot home cooked German dinner. - And everything that goes with it. - What about your Papa? If Papa would be here he'd do the very same thing I'm going to do. I kinda doubt it. Look, pay up. They've been in there for two hours. He ain't coming out tonight. He'll be out. I tell you no guy in uniform can make out with the burgermeisters daughter. If the uniform got in its way Freddy'd get out of it. How he'll get out of the uniform I don't know, but he'll do it. - Grandmother was right about German girls. - What did she say? She had an expression. I never knew word for word what it meant. Went like this. - Could you translate that for me? - Well I could give you the general idea. - No no, I like to know word for word. - Well it means that... That a German girl know how to satisfy a man in every way. In every way? In every way? Guess a man would have to get married to find out if that's true. - That's something I can never do. - You are already married? No, but I'm an American soldier. Already you're married? You're the burgermeister's daughter and you're off limits to me. And why? Simply because I'm wearing this uniform. - Does that seem fair to you? - No. Why should a piece of cloth dictade what a man's feelings shoud be? It's inhuman. This uniform is like a wall between us. All of a sudden I hate it. - You shouldn't say that. - It's true. I hate it. It is a cruel wall that keeps us apart. What right do they have to keep me imprisoned in this khaki shirt? It's a symbol of tyranny. I reject it. Let them court martial me. Let them shoot me. I defy the army. I defy the Pentagon. The Congress. The President himself. I will not let the deny me my rights as a man. At last I'm free. Free to be myself. Not an American soldier, but a German boy in love with a German girl. - Papa. - Anna! Good evening, sir. I suppose you're wondering what I'm doing here. Tonight the new NATO physical fitness program goes into effect... And I've been assigned to this block. All together now! One, two, three, four ... I'm so relaxed, so lucky. You will remember your pledge of secrecy? Oh yes, Your Highness. I'll follow your instructions to the letter. Your Highness? Say it once more. Fanny of Omaha! Absent without leave. Gaining entrance to the burgermeister's home under false pretenses. Caught out of uniform and half naked. Attempted seduction of the burgermeister's daughter. Soldier, these charges are dynamite! - Yes sir, you're in a lot of trouble, Colonel. - I'm in trouble? I know you're due for that star on your shoulder, and it's gonna look mighty bad on the record. Man can't control his own troops. Who says I can't control my troops? Just look at the violations going on at the base, sir. Right under your very nose. What violations? Illegal craps games, smuggling girls in. Black market in cigarettes. There's even a still for making bootleg whisky. Not to mention the stag films shown in the latrine every night. Sir, your base is a hotbed of corruption. Well I'll see every man responsible for those violations in here on the carpet. - Here I am, sir. - Just you? One lousy corporal making such a fool of his colonel. I doubt if you'll get that star, sir. Are you trying to blackmail me with your own criminal record? Blackmail's such an ugly word. Couldn't we say persuasion? How any man can use such a vile, cheap trick as this to get a girl. The house where your grandmother was born! Corporal, you're... Daddy, I just wanted to know what time you'd be home. Well I don't know, Kathy darling. It all depends what I decide to do with corporal Benson. Freddy Benson? You know the house we're renting, his grandmother was born here. - You and my daughter? - Yes sir, I guess I'll have to testify to that too. - You wouldn't. - Are you suggesting that I lie, under oath? I will be the laughing stock of the whole European Command. I'll never get my star. 28 years I've worked for it! Now now, Colonel. This is no time to panic. True, you're in a lot of trouble. But maybe I can help you. How, how? What can you do? For instance, if I was a civilian I wouldn't be available to testify. Now I'm due for a discharge in a couple of months if I could have that a little bit earlier, like today. Then I could be packed up, off the base, out of Germany before word of your disgrace came out. Yes, that's it! I will process your discharge, effective immediately. Wise decision. And I like a man who backs up his decisions with money. What money? Well I'll need travelling expenses. And I'm leaving some pretty lucrative businesses behind. (unintelligible) You'll never regret it. You gotta admit, I made some pretty good liquor. Sorry to be busting in at you Mac, but I had to get away from them freuleins. Appears to be one you haven't gotten away from. Freddy, meine liebe. You did not tell me you were going. - Sudden orders, sweetie! - You will marry me like you promised, nein? Of course, just as soon as I get permission from my commanding general back in Washington. I will write to him. What is his name? Lee! General Robert E. Lee! - General Robert E. Lee! - Let's see her try to contact him. That's rather a shabby trick, isn't it? I see you got a lot to learn about women. Let me tell you something. The more you lie to them, the more you take them... - Rougher you treat them, the better they like you. - Is that a fact? I could tell you things about women that would curl your hair. I'm afraid I'm a bit naive when it comes to the weaker sex. The weaker sex? Let me put some new colours in your paintbox. They're about as weak as the engine that's pulling this train. Remember this: It takes six men to carry a guy to his grave. It takes one woman to put him there. I never thought of it that way. I can tell you're the kind of guy, goes around opening doors for broads, holding chairs. - Knocking yourself out, right? - I've been known to do that. You know who started this whole schmear? Uh, English guy, called... - Raleigh. That's the goof. - Sir Walter Raleigh? This broad wants to cross the street. So he lays his coat down on the water for her to walk on. She's got dry feet. He puts the wet coat on, gets pneumonia. You really are adding some new colours to my paintbox. I haven't even started. Listen... We're the weaker sex, not women. We're perishable, like ripe peaches hanging on a tree. - You're married, aren't you? - Yes. I can tell. You've got that "picked" look. And your wife's got you right in the palm of her hand. Squeezing the juice out of you. Almost hurts. When you're squeezed dry they stick you in the ground and they go looking for some other peaches. It is disgusting. All I'm saying is peaches of the world, unite. - Let's hang on the tree as long as we can. - Amen. I'm gonna tell you something that never entered your mind. This world is full of rich widows. - No. - Yeah. And where do they get the loot? The squeezed peaches? I say it's time for a change. Let's live off them a while. Let them give us the money. That probably shocks a guy like you, don't it? That's rather a revolutionary thought. But how do we go about affecting this change? You're so brainwashed it's pathetic. Time to eat. - You probably figured you're gonna pay for your own meal? - Of course. Come with me. - Now what do you see? - People eating. You know what I see? Three free meals. And I can have my choise. Sit over there and watch me. Excuse me ma'am, may I sit here? - If you wish. - Thank you. - Guten tag, can I help you. - Yes, please. What is the cheapest thing you have? Liverwurst sandwich, two marks. It's too much. Could I just have a piece of bread and some water? You are French? Oh no, ma'am. That's just a prayer I learned from my French grandmother. - Poor woman. - Is something wrong? I'm afraid she's awfully sick in a hospital in New Orleans. I'm just trying to save up enough money for an operation. That is why you are eating just bread and water? Well it's only been six days. You poor man! You will have more than bread and water today. No ma'am, I couldn't let you buy me a meal. Bring this soldier the best food you have. All he can eat, and the finest wine. Well did you learn something? You know you could have saved yourself two and a half bucks on lunch alone. - You were magnificent. - Oh you shouldn't have left. You missed the best part. There's more to your performance? She gave me 100 francs to send to my sick French grandmother in New Orleans. - Is your grandmother sick? - No, that's part of the pitch. 100 francs, thats 20 bucks. - You ever take a woman for twenty bucks? - No, I'm afraid that's a little out of my class. No it isn't, think big. You got possibilities. - You're not a bad looking fella. - Well thank you. Oh I'm too old fashioned. One of those peaches who's been off the tree for too long. You could be an excellent team. I will take the young, you get old. I could show you the ropes. We'd make a great team. I'll take the young ones, you get the old ones. - The old ones for me? - Yeah, they're the ones you can take for the real loot. More than twenty dollars? A guy like you could knock off 50-100 bucks a night. Isn't there a name for men who get money from women? Mhmm, smart. I know you don't need the money, but live a little, have some kicks. No, I'm too settled in my ways. Wife, family, obligations. Well, you and me could have had a ball on the Riviera. - Are you headed for the Riviera? - Yeah. I hear there's a town loaded with rich dames. Called Bormarte sur Mer. - Have you ever been to Bonmarte sur Mer? - No. I'm afraid you've been misinformed. All the social activity's moved further down the coast now, to the Italian riviera. Portofino. Bonmarte sur Mer used to be a live spot, but the old and retired couples have taken over now. - It's dead. - You know the place? I live there. I'm considered the town playboy. You know something, though? I've found some of my greatest action in quiet towns. Wouldn't hurt to look it over. Excuse me, I must send a telegram to my wife and children. I get it off the next stop. I always have to let them know exactly when I'm going to arrive. They really got you on that leash, haven't they? Yes, I'm afraid I'm one peach who's been picked and crated. It's a shame. The things I could have taught you about women. Here we are. As you Americans would say: Deadsville. You call that deadsville? - Oh I'm sorry, I thought this was my compartment. - It is. We're just getting off. - This is Portefino, isn't it? - No, this is still France. Portofino is another 200 miles. My sick Italian grandmother is waiting for me there and I've made a mistake on my ticket. Please, stay in this compartment. You can ride with me to Portefino. If I can only get there in time to earn some money to pay for her operation. - I'll do anything to get the money. - He will too. - Good luck soldier. My best to your Italian grandmother. - Grazie, signore. Welcome back, sir. Your telegram didn't give me much time. - Was the Italian girl suitable? - She was a perfect decoy. May I ask why she was needed? Andre, I consider Bonmarte sur Mer my private hunting preserve. That soldier was a poacher. But such a man you would hardly be competition for you. That's true, but a man who hunts rabbits may scare away the big game. I think that Italian rabbit you came up with shoud lead him a merry chase. Mrs Larsson-Knudsen, the widow of the Swedish match king. - Didn't he die about two years ago? - At the age of 91. Here is a picture of his widow. If I live to be 91, that's the way I want to go. When is she due to arrive? She left the Excelsior hotel in Genoa at 7:40 this morning. Driving a Mercedes, Swedish license number XX274. This certainly does beat walking. You are a very devoted but foolish young man to think you could walk all the way to Stockholm. I'd walk to the ends of the Earth to see my Swedish grandmother. As soon as we reach Bonmarte sur Mer you must telegraph some money for her operation. - Ah, there is her car! That's strange. - What is? But she is not alone. There is a soldier with her. The poacher has returned? I'm afraid he's no longer satisfied with rabbits. - Have you seen enough? - I certainly have. Spending my money that I gave him for the operation of his grandmother... ...on a girl like that! - Madame will sign the complaint? - Gladly. I want to compliment you on you excellent policework. Spotting a fraud like him so quickly! That's my job, madam. To keep our little community free of men like him. And safe for women like you. I'm telling you, I didn't steal the money from her. She gave it to me! She signed this complaint, Monsieur. She caught me with another woman. You're French, you understand. To be with another woman, that is French. To be caught, that is American. Well what am I gonna do? How am I gonna get outta here? That will be difficult. The charge is a serious one. And you are a vagrant. I know! No I'm not. I got a friend here, a real buddy. His name is Lawrence Jameson. Come now, M., our town's leading citizen? How would he know a low-down mongrel like you? How would he know ministers like you? We're pals! He'll remember me, just tell him it's Freddy. The mongrel from the train! This is a very serious accusation. Who will judge this case? This is a very grave charge. Who will be trying this case? - Judge Reno. - The hanging judge! What hanging judge? Ever since his daughter was seduced by an American soldier, he's been a obcessed man. There must be some alternative. Suppose he promises to return to the United States and never come back? - That's it, Dad! - Would you give your word? You've got it! The word of a man like this means nothing. I can not risk turning a mad dog like him loose on the Riviera. What if I personally took him to the airport and put him on that plane back to the United States? Yeah he'll put me on the plane. You know you can trust him. M Jameson, why do you wish to become involved with a depraved man like this? I don't think he's depraved. I think he's just emotionally disturbed. His warped attitude towards the female sex probably stems from some... ...experience during infancy that left him hostile towards women. - Like what? - Who knows, maybe the poor man is the victim of... ...improper potty training. - That's me. That's what did it. Well, Monsieur. If you give your word that you will put him on the plane... ...I'll release him into your custody. I'll never forget this. If you ever come to the States look me up in Detroit, I want my grandmother to meet you. - You really have a grandmother? - Sweetest little woman you ever met. She's the only bookie in town that'll give you crack odds. You are on a special mission for His Highness, aren't you? - What? - I saw the Prince shake your hand and pat you on the back. - Prince? - You don't have to cover up with me, I'm not a security risk. I too have served His Highness. In fact, it's probably my money that's financing your mission. - You are..? - Fanny Eubank. Or as Prince calls me, Fanny of Omaha. Yes, he speaks of you with great affection. To His Highness! To the people of his enslaved country. To your mission! Do you think it will succeed? It's looking better every minute. Tell me, how much money was the Prince able to raise on my jewels? Not enough, I'm afraid. Here. I'm sure I can trust you to give it to him. I'll give it to him. - Excuse me, sir. - Did I ring for you, Arthur? No, sir. I'm sorry sir, but the man said it was very urgent. - What man? - The courier, sir. He's waiting outside. He said you would recognize the secret password, sir. - What secret password? - Fanny of Omaha. That would be all, Arthur. Arthur, will you take this to the guest bedroom, unpack it and see that everything is neatly pressed. - Do as the... courier says. - Yes, sir. Your Highness, I bring you grave tidings. Your secret has fallen into evil hands. The maladjusted grandson of at Detroid bookmaker. Oh boy what a jerk I was. Telling you how to take women. And you the big daddy of us all. How much do you want? Your Highness, I couldn't accept money from a man who needs every penny of it to free his enslaved people. Let them be slaves a little longer. How's 5000 dollars? Master. Oh, giver of knowledge. I've come to sit at your feet and learn. Teach me, mould me, polish me. I'm in your hands. I wouldn't soil them on you. Well now, is that any way to talk to your partner? By no stretch of the imagination would I (cooperate) with someone like you. You're crude! So is oil until you refine it into high octane gasoline. - Up my octane, big daddy! - And if I say no? You wanna try? You do have a sort of brutish appeal to women. You're certainly unprincipled. Lying and cheating come naturally to you. You completely lack moral qualms. You see. Everybody's got a good side if you look for it. All right. I cut you in for 20%, on this understanding. I call the shots. I run the operation. You're my leader, anything you say. You cut the cake. All I ask for are a few crumbs. I tell you. He will not be satisfied with crumbs. Or a slice, or even the cake. Before he's through he will want the entire bakery. Andre, the bakery is ours. This man is not capable of taking it away from us. He is a maladjusted, uneducated army corps. So was Hitler when he started. I tell you, he will wreck everything. I ask you, is that the face of a man who can be trusted? No! It is the face of a predatory animal. - An ape! - Yes, there is a resemblance. - It was a mistake to keep him. - I had no choice. The trick now is to turn the ape into a harmless entertaining monkey. Your car isn't going to last long with a monkey driving it. It's insured. I understand now. M. has a plan. A hairpin turn, we loosen the wheel... - That's out of the question. - Of course, you're worrying about the car. But I have a better plan. There is a certain man. He owes his parole to me. Rene the knife. A master with the stiletto and an absolute magician at hiding a body. Andre... Murder? As police inspector I give you my word... the case will be investigated in a very slipshod manner. I have another plan! A marvellous one, listen to me! Hey partners! When are we going to get a little action going, I'm all ready. That tailor of yours really whips up a mean set of prints. Look at that! The royal uniform? I'm gonna study under the Prince. What am I gonna wear, overalls? But to presume that you can impersonate royalty! This is... No no, Andre. Royalty he aspires to be, royalty he shall be! You shouldn't have had your father send all this money. But you said you couldn't leave without taking care of your destitute countrymen. I feel like a kept man. Please don't be angry with me. It was the only way I could get you back to Tulsa. Daddy's building a brand new church just for our wedding. When do you think we ought to fly by? I think perhaps we should go by ship. Ruprecht likes the water. - Who's Ruprecht? - My brother, the young prince. You've got a brother? And he's coming with us? Yes, where I go Ruprecht goes. I think that's wonderful! I'm coming home with two princes! - Shall we go tell Ruprecht the good news? - Yes, I'm dying to meet him. - You never told me you have a brother. - He keeps pretty much to himself. In fact, if we weren't engaged to be married I wouldn't have you meet him now. What's he doing down here in the cellar? His chambers are there. These massive stone walls provide maximum security. Ruprecht! It is I, your brother! I have someone who wants to meet you. Don't be frightened, he's perfectly harmless. Come on down, Ruprecht. I want you to meet this nice lady. - Mother? - No, not Mother. She's my future wife. Your future Sister-in-law. Come on down now. Nothing to be afraid of. So long as you keep smiling. - Hello, Ruprecht. - Mother. No, Ruprecht, but we're gonna live with this nice lady. In Tulsa, Oklahoma. - Both of you? - You're forgetting to smile. - My earrings! - Keep smiling! Don't eat them, Ruprecht. Tulsa will be wonderful for him, it's nice and flat. He can run everywhere. We've tried letting him run around here, but... ...he kept falling off the mountain. Yes, it hurts. But you won't fall any more. Because this nice lady's going to hold your hand, and lead you all around Tulsa. - Mother? - Alright, Ruprecht. If it makes you happy, you may call her Mother. Mother! Once you learn to feed him... ...he's not much trouble at all. And always remember to keep smiling. You feed him. Ruprecht, I will not tolerate snarling at the table. When we go to live with Miss Harrington in West Palm Beach and she gives those big dinner parties... ...you must let her feed you. and it is a venue for evening it must allow the food. Try it again. That does it! Snarling is one thing, biting is another. - That could be infectious. - For that you go back down to your room. He's even turning on me! Back boy, back! Keep smiling. Thank heavens this will only happen to one out of every three of our children. Driving in a car relaxes Ruprecht. Keep smiling. Very good, Ruprecht! And when Miss Weddell's father runs for reelection to the Senate... ...you can drive him all over Iowa to make his campaign speeches. Freddy, we've had a very good month. There's a fat cake to slice up. Start cutting, Dad. Now, Andre gets 5% ... You got a good deal, my Grandmother pays 10. 5% for operating expenses, the chateau and all. I go along with that. You got a great pad here. Due to the fact that we have had such a good month, that puts us in a very high tax bracket. - For example... - Woah, dad. Back up. Taxes? You must wonder what I do with my money. Your money I don't wonder about that. What are you doing with my money? I'm deducting tax. Which brings us to my original question. What tax? Freddy, you have a goal in life. To be the highest peach on the tree, where noone can pick or squeeze you. Yeah well I got a funny feeling that fingers are reaching for me right now. And if I'm ever gonna get squeezed it ain't gonna be by a man. Hear me out. Governments use taxes to benefit the masses. I use them to benefit the individual. - Which happens to be you. - No. Come with me. - Where are we going? - In every man's mind there are unopened doors. All I want is a chance to open a couple of new doors for you. The family of a man engaged in srebrnarstvom over 400 years old. This man's family have been silversmiths for over 400 years. It will take him three months to complete that goblet to his satisfaction. Factories turn the out by the hundreds. Artistically his work is superior but economically he can't compete. So let him go out of business. Freddy, if that man goes out of business his artistry will be lost to the world. More than that, a way of life will begin to disappear. A way of life that puts pride of accomplishment above profits. And you finance him? And that's where my tax money goes? - Part of it. - And the rest of it? Come with me. This man has devoted his life to rediscovering the secrets that made Stradivarius' and Guarneri's violins the finest ever known. So what if he makes a better fiddle? The world of music is enriched forever. In the meantime you're cutting him in on my tax money. Enough to live on, yes. Freddy, centuries from now when the archeologists unearth the remains of our civilization... ...do you want them to find just jukeboxes? Sure it's a gamble. But if that ballet mistress develops just one Pavlova or one Ulanova... it's well worth it. If the man who had created that beautiful tapestry had not had the patronage of a rich nobleman to pay the bills... ...that work of art would not be in existance today. Do you see what I be getting at, Freddy? Money in itself is of no value. Like an arrow it must have a target. Look, Daddy, you wanna play Robin Hood? Ok, but don't shoot my arrows. There's one thing the archeologists aren't gonna dig up, and that's Freddy's money. Cause I'm spending it right now. So hand it over, tax free. There's one thing my Grandmother always told me. Never bet on a longshot. And, Daddy, you're backing a lot of losers. You're forgetting one thing. You agreed that I would run the operation. Well I didn't know you were gonna cut so deep. Alright, Freddy. You'll get your money. But you realize this is the end of our association. I'm a big boy now. I'll go it alone. Where? Welcome, pleasure to have you here. I like it right here. This is my territory. Was. Hey boy, over here. - Who's that girl checking in there? - Miss Janet Walker. - Who's she? - The American soap queen. OK, thanks. Yeah, I think I'm gonna enjoy it here. Freddy, you can't operate alone in this league. You're out of your class. You reached your social peak as my halfwit brother. - I know what's buggin you, you're scared. - Of what? Me. Competition. You've been king of the mountain so long you think that you own it. Look out, Dad, cause Freddy's on his way up. - Two lions on the mountain now, and I'm a hungry one. - Believe me, Freddy. I'm not afraid of you. But there simply isn't room on this particular mountain for the both of us. - I'll buy that. - Are you challenging me? Are you proposing to pitch your crude animal instincts against... ...intelligence, culture and breeding? If that means am I kicking your pride off this hill, yes. Alright, you're on. You seem very interested in that young lady who just checked in. Shall we make her the test case? OK. We should set a figure. First man to extract that amount from miss Walker wins. - How much? - Make it easy. 25 thousand? - Fine with me. - Winner take all? - Loser blows town. - May the better man win. Thanks. She's at the roulette table. - What about Freddy? - He has disappeared. I told you! No Rene the Knife. I told you! Rene aka No Knife. My word, M. Noone has seen him. He has dropped from sight. Perhaps the jackal realizes he is no match for the lion. You keep your eyes open for that jackal, he'll show up. Pardon me, miss? Would you place a bet for me? It's terribly difficult for me to reach the table. I'd be happy to. What number would you like? Well, the way my luck's been running... would you pick one? Of course. Now if I could just win enough money to pay for the operation. Shouldn't the army pay for your operation? Oh it's not for me, it's for my Grandmother. She's in a hospital in Cleveland. Cleveland? That's where I live. No! - Wish me luck. - I do, I do. Don't you want to wish me luck too, sir? 1900 francs! Almost 400 dollar. Now my Grandmother can have her operation and walk again, thanks to you. Freddy, would an operation help you? My problem isn't physical, it's emotional. Would you like to tell me about it? - It's terribly painful. - It might help. Well I was engaged to this girl, back in the States. We had the wedding date all set. Day before I was to fly home, got a letter from her. - She... - She what, Freddy? She ran off and married this dancer. That night I had nightmares. I saw them dancing everywhere. And when I woke up the next morning I couldn't walk. Legs were gone. What a traumatic experience. Can't the army psychiatrist help you? Well they've been trying. They've done their best, I just don't respond. Surely someone must be able to help you. Well there is one person. The famous Swiss psychiatrist. He specialises in cases like this. - Who is he? - Dr. Emil Schaffhausen. He runs the famous Schaffhausen clinic in Lucerne. Why don't you go to him? I've written to him for months trying to get an appointment but it's impossible. Well a man like Dr. Schaffhausen is in demand all over the world. He can command astronomical fees. Why should he bother with a poor soldier like me? What do you mean by astronomical? I heard that he gets as much as 25 000 dollars for a case. Where would I get 25 000 dollar? - It's impossible. - Nothing is impossible, Freddy. Just beautiful out here. I'm so glad we're staying at the same hotel. - So am I. - Let's come out tomorrow and get some sun. Oh please no. You're here to have fun. Mustn't waste your time taking care of me. Freddy, how unselfish. Here you are suffering, still you can only think of others. It's my Grandmother's philsophy. She used to say... Even the poorest man can be a Robin Hood of happiness. Take from yourself and give to others. How fortunate you are to have a grandmother like that. Yeah, she's been a great help to me. - Take me away from here, quickly. - What's the matter? Oh, I'm so sorry. It reminds you of her. And him. Let's go to your room and write another letter to Dr. Schaffhausen. It's a waste of time. There's only one language he understands. Money. Then we'll assure him that he'll get his money. Gee, I wish you hadn't said all those nice things about me. - You make me sound like a hero. - You are a hero. You shouldn't have promised him the money. Where am I gonna get it? You just leave it to me, Freddy. When the time comes, I promise you'll have it. Freddy! Please don't. No one's ever been this kind to me except Granny. Now you try and get a hold of yourself. I'll be right back, I'm just going to mail the letter. The King is dead. Long live the king. Dr. Schaffhausen! Dr. Emil Schaffhausen! Message for Dr. Schaffhausen! Dr. Emil Schuffhausen? Good luck Doctor Andre Of the Schaffhausen clinic in Lucerne? This is like a miracle. I just mailed you a letter. - Fine, then I get it when I return to my clinic. - Could I talk to you for just a moment? Please, I'm on vacation. Visit me in the clinic. - Please, I'm on a vacation. Come and see me in my clinic. - It's not about me. It's this American soldier, corporal Fred Benson. You saw him. He sat right next to you at the roulette table. Benson? Oh yes, isn't he the one who wrote me all those letters, something about his fiancee running off with a dancer? Yes, that's the one. And he's right here in the hotel. - Doctor, will you see him? - The army psychiatrist will look after him. They've tried, they can't help him. You're the only one. Always I'm the only one. Freud, Adler, Jung, Schaffhausen. Then who? They've got to find somebody else, they're exhausting me. Doctor, if you only knew the kind of person corporal Benson is. Brave, kind, heroic. And it's in your power to make him walk again. How can you refuse? Why does everyone make me feel so guilty? - If it's a matter of money ... - You haven't given him any money, have you? - Not yet. - Thank goodness. Thank God. I will give you a free advice: Let me give you one free word of advice. Never give him any money. - Why not? - It would make my job much harder. You see, his ego has already received one shattering blow from a woman. - To take charity from another... - Is that why he broke down and cried when I told him I would give him the money? Of course. Now we don't want any more of that, do we? Doctor Schaffhausen, does this mean that you will help him? I'll see him. But remember what I told you, no money to him. If I take the case, just pay the fee directly to me. - I will, I will. - Where is the boy? In his room, I'll take you to him. He'll be overjoyed to see you! I can hardly wait to observe his reaction. Come in. Freddy, I have the most marvellous surprise! Close your eyes! Who is the one person in this world, outside of your Grandmother... ...that you'd most like to see at this moment? ...that you'd most like to see at this moment? - I give up, who? - Dr. Emil Schaffhausen! At last we meet, corporal Benson. After all your letters, I feel I know you. - He can't believe it's really you. - Yes, I think that is it. I'm here to help you, my boy. Now, let's take a look at our legs. Any feeling at all in them? No, sir. - Did you feel that? - No, sir. - How about that? - No, sir, nothing. Any feeling there? Doctor, this seems so cruel. On the contrary, corporal Benson would be the happiest man in the world if he did feel any pain. - Right? - Right. This case intrigues me. I'll take corporal Benson as a patient. Freddy, did you hear that? I'm renting a chateu in the area, we'll move him in there. So I can really go to work on him. Doctor, thank you so much. Do you think you'll have him walking again? I'll have him running! I'll restore feeling to these lifeless limbs... Or my name is not doctor... Emil Schaffhausen! Oh look, doctor! He's so happy he's crying! This will be your room, Freddy, you mustn't be frightened... I'll have my eye on you day and night. Freddy, can you really believe that this is happening? Doctor Schaffhausen, money alone really can't pay you for what you're doing. I wish there was something else I could do to show my gratitude. - We can discuss that later. - You are more than a doctor. You're a great humanitarian. Sacrificing your vacation. Sharing your chateu. Freddy, do you realise what this man is doing? Would you care to see around the chateu? It has a fascinating history. Once upon a time, this chateu was occupied by a noble prince and his younger brother. The Prince was a charming man. Handsome, kind, generous, knowledgeable. Handsome, kind, generous, knowledgeable. A lot like you, Doctor. But his younger brother. Evil, sick, depraved. He was jealous of the good prince and tried very hard to destroy him. What an awful man. Then one day a lovely lady came to the chateu. She was rich but also very sweet and pure and innocent. Immediately the evil young prince set out to rob her. - Not only of her money, but her honor. - What happened? With his low, cunning trickery he succeeded. - He was sick and depraved. - Simply maladjusted. If only there had been a doctor Schaffhausen to help him. Yes, that can never happen today. That poor miserable creature would have been restored to a useful life. Just as I'm going to restore Freddy. Now of course the most interesting rooms in the chateu are on the second floor. But what about Freddie? - Go to your room and get ready for bed. - Shouldn't someone help him? I want him to get used to going to bed alone. I'd like to come upstairs too! Alright, well come on. You're not crippled. - Doctor, he is! - Only in his mind. But it seems so cruel. Many of the things that I'm going to do will seem cruel to you... ...but psychiatrically and therapeudic, he'll walk that much sooner. - You must trust me. - I do! - First, I'll show you the ballroom. - A ballroom on the second floor? It used to be a magnificent bedroom. In fact it was the bedroom where the lovely lady was wronged by the evil prince. So the good prince had it converted into a ballroom. To make it a room of music and happiness instead of sorrow and tears. Some people say they still can feel the presence of the good prince in this room. I do, I really do! If he were here I'm sure he would ask you to dance. You know, Doctor, this whole evening has been like a miracle. Especially what you're going to do to Freddy. What I'm going to do to that boy should have been done a long time ago. Freddy! What happened? I heard the music, so I dragged myself up the stairs and then I saw you... With him. Dancing. Oh you poor man. How horrible. Of all things. To see us dancing. You are right. - Now he can't see us. - Doctor, this is barbarous! You must try to remember what I told you about constructive therapy. You know where the door knob is. Reach for it! We have to create a desire for walking which strengthens the desire to regret. We must create a desire to walk that is stronger than his desire to be pitied. The fact that he dragged himself upstairs is proof that the therapy is already working. - He's clawing at the door! - No pity. I know it is difficult for you, but... Only through our strength will Freddy find his. - He fell! - Yes, and he'll fall again and again. There he goes. Truly, M., you are a genius. How quickly and completely you have gained the upper hand. - I still haven't got the money. - But you have your jackal safe in his cage. - What can he do? - Yes, it's true that without this he is slightly immobilised. Mademoiselle Walker she's arranging to get the money, no? Oh yes, she's on her way to the chateu right now. She may have it with her. M. is indeed formidable! The man who duels with you is fighting with an empty pistol. - The gardener! - What happened? But who would want to steal the lawn mower and drive away on it? Leon, stop the car! Freddy, where are you going?! Come back! Freddy, what in the world... what are you doing on this? - When the gardener wasn't looking I pulled myself onto it. - But why? I'm trying to get down to the beach so drag myself down to the water. - But you shouldn't try to swim. - I wasn't going to try. - Surely you don't mean... - It will be a blessing for everyone. Grandmother will get my GI insurance. Schaffhausen will be able to have his vacation and you won't have to waste your money on me. Don't say things like that. Money isn't important at a time like this. Why I'd spend anything to get you well. Anything. You're a saint. Forget about me. Leave me. Not for one moment. Leon, get mr. Benson into the car. Oh please, I don't want to be a burden to anybody. Get rid of me. Drop me on the road and run over me. Look at me, helpless as a baby. And I'm going to take care of you like a baby. - How does that feel? - Wonderful. Would you put some lotion on my legs too, please? Freddy, I am. - Can't you feel anything? - No, but keep trying. Maybe something will happen. I'm sorry I was so depressed this morning, I had a hard session with Dr. Schaffhausen. He made me talk about... her. Still hurt you to think about her, doesn't it? I only wish my heart were in my legs. Then I couldn't feel this terrible pain. But Freddy, it's good therapy to talk about her. Tell me. What was she like? Where did you meet her? In Sunday school. I guess that's why I trusted her so much. I never thought that a Sunday school teacher could do what she did. Especially to another Sunday school teacher. - You taught Sunday school? - Oh yeah. I love children. When I think of all their tiny little feet that I guided along the right path. Now I can't even guide my own. Freddy, you'll walk again. Tell me more about it. Well we dated for about three years then one evening after choir practice we were walking home and... I kissed her. Now you won't believe this, but this was the first girl that I ever kissed. Knowing you, I do believe it. And then they took away my hymn book and gave me a gun. She kissed me goodbye. To think that the last kiss that I'll ever know was that of a jezebel. Oh no, Freddy! Why you'll be kissed by many women. Kiss of pity perhaps, never one of love. That's ridiculous. You're an attractive and exciting man. Am I attractive and exciting to you? Dr. Schaffhausen! We were just... that is to... Freddy was feeling so depressed. I just wanted to cheer him up. - I'm awful low, doc. - You are indeed. The chauffeur carried him down to the beach. I thought the sun and warm sand would be good for him. As a matter of fact, warm sand would be excellent physical therapy for Freddy. I can think of nothing that would benefit him more right now than warm sand. Lots of it. - Isn't it about time we picked up Freddie? - We'll give him one more hour. Believe me, the warm sand treatment is just what he needs. Psychiatrically speaking, when you kissed Freddy you were in fact rewarding him for being helpless. - Thus encouraging retrogression. - But I felt so sorry for him. That heartrending story about how they took away his hymn book and gave him a gun. And then being betrayed by a sunday school teacher! - Surely that must touch even you. - It makes me physically sick but we must hide our pity. Any sign of affection at this point will only retard his progress. I'll try, Doctor, but it won't be easy. A person like Freddy just naturally attracts kindness, gentleness and affection. Oh Harriette, I know you like me but really, I'm not hungry. Let me put it this way, Miss Walker. You are paying me a great deal of money to cure this boy. - Don't jeopardize my progress. - I won't, Doctor. Oh about the money. I'll have a check for you within 48 hours. I'm not thinking about the money. The only important thing is what happens to that boy in the next 48 hours. We must create in him a desire to walk that is so overpowering... ...that it supercedes every other instinct. - Whatever you say. - He won't want us to leave him behind again. Our job now is to make it so difficult for him to be with us... That he will literally jump out of that wheelchair to do it. - Will you steel yourself for the ordeal ahead? - I promise. Don't look back. Doctor, if I didn't know this was helping Freddy I'd feel guilty. Harriette, this thing with you and me just can't work out. Now get lost. - He's trying to follow us. - Good. I know I promised, doctor, but how much of this can he stand? Not much more, I think. - He looks absolutely desperate. - Good. We are reaching the climactic point. We mustn't let down now. She is a fabulous dancer, Freddy. Wouldn't you like to have the next dance with her? Come on boy, get up out of that chair! Dance with the girl. Okay, if you just want to sit there and miss all the fun. - Hey buddy, who's the louse? - That's the crummiest bit I've ever seen. - Making fun of a guy who's crippled. - Get up and dance, he says. Oh I'd like to belt him one! I wouldn't mind so much, but she used to be my girl. - He took her away from me. - Why that dirty fink! I know I could win her back if I could just get him out of the way for a few days. - Buddy, it's as good as done. - There's a transport plane leaving tonight for Iceland. How would you like for him to be on it? Fellas. I think I'm gonna cry. - Hey, all set? - You know how to get to the chateu? We'll be waiting. Don't be discouraged. Real progress was made tonight. I think we can both be ready for something big to happen. I hope so, I couldn't go through another night like tonight. - Good Evening! - Cablegram for you, Miss Walker. Thank you. Excuse me, Doctor. It's wonderful! I'll have your money tomorrow. Daddy sold the car and the furniture and I've already made arrangements to sell the mink coat. And with the 5000 dollar cash prize I'll have more than enough for your fee. - Cash prize? - Yes. I got that, the car, the mink, the house full of furniture and this trip to Europe for winning the contest. - What contest? - To select the American soap queen. - Your father doesn't own the American soap company? - My goodness no! I just work there. Freddy, try and get it into your head. The bet's off, she's a poor girl, she hasn't got the money. - She can raise it. - Only by selling everything she owns. Why do I care where she gets it? Dough is dough, the bet's on. Don't you have any feelings at all for this girl? Plenty. And when I get the money that's next. It may hurt a little but try to think. I've got you boxed in on all sides. Well we'll see who's got who boxed. And crated and shipped. All right, you can't talk on my level. I'll come down to yours. The only emotion you stir in that girl is pity. You are confusing that with sex. There's one thing Freddy Benson never confused about and that's sex. That girl is mine any time I want her. You worried about the dough? Forget the money. Let's make her the bet. - You can't be serious. - Is it a bet? - Janet is a decent girl. - Is it a bet? - I wouldn't take advantage of a girl like that. - Is it a bet? Okay it's a bet! Only I'm not competing, I'm just betting that you'll fail. - You know why? - Tell me. Remember the silversmith? The violin maker? The ballet mistress? The were all artists striving for perfection, striving to create something superior. Janet is something superior, Freddy, and you're not going to destroy her. I wouldn't let you strike a match on a Stradivarius violin or... ...put out a cigar butt on Michelangelo's statue. The reason I could never let you become king of the mountain... It wouldn't stay a mountain. You'd turn it into a garbage dump. - What do you want? - You're blocking my driveway! - See the captain in the back. - Get your blooming truck out of the way. - I wanna get my car in. - See the captain. Freddy! I thought Dr. Schaffhausen took you home. Well he did but I couldn't sleep. I had to talk to you. Of course, dear. Janet, would you like for me to walk again? Of course I would, you know that. I'd do anything. - I think there's a way. - Tell me! What is it? Well I've been thinking about what Dr. Schaffhausen always told me... ...that I could walk again if the desire was strong enough. Yes. He said that to me too. Well you're the only person in the world who can give me that desire. How? What can I do? Dr. Schaffhausen said that since it was love that put me in a wheelchair... ...it would take love to get me out. I'm in love, Janet. With you. - But I still have that terrible fear of being rejected. - Oh no, you mustn't! If I'm rejected this time I'll never walk again as long as I live. - Don't talk like that! - I can't help it. I'm afraid my love won't be returned. - It will be! It is. - If I'm disappointed again, I'll kill myself. You won't be disappointed. Test me. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. But I love you, Freddy. Please try to stand up. - You're not lying to me the way she did? - No, Freddy, no! Try to stand up, please, for me. I'm standing. I'm standing! Yes. Now walk to me! - I can't. I can't. - Try. Please try. - You won't disappoint me? - No, no! You will not disappoint me? - You will love me? - Yes, yes! - Look, I'm walking! - Oh my darling. Yes, come to me. - Now you must sit down and rest. - No, not yet. Now that I'm on my feet I wanna see how far I can go. Stand in the doorway there, let me try to reach you. Oh, my darling! Please, you must rest now. No, stand over by the bed. Let me try to get to you there. Come to me, Freddy! Janet, my true love. You've given me new strength. - I made it! - Yes, you made it. - And only because you love me! - We all love you, Freddy. This is the happiest moment of a doctor's life. When he can prevent a tragedy. No wonder they call you the genius. You said he'd come here tonight and he did. You said you would come tonight and he came. You said he'd walk and he did. - Freddy, this man can perform miracles! - I'm beginning to believe it. Come my boy, you've had exhausting evening. I just wanna know one thing. How'd you get off the plane? I never got on. There were six paratroopers in the back of the truck. Seven. Parachute Regiment. British army. Hey fellas! It's big daddy and the gimp. And he can walk just like big daddy said he could. Gentlemen, there's more food and more champagne on the way. In the meanwhile, can I rely on you to keep our friend here entertained until I get back? Now you try to get that key, buddy, and you're really gonna need a wheelchair. Doctor, couldn't I just call Freddy on the telephone? No. Now you must trust me on this. But I love Freddie and I think he loves me and if he's cured ... And why is he cured? Because you followed my recommendations without question. Yes, I must admit you've been right about everything. Do I have to admit, you were all right. And I'm right about this. You and Freddy have just been through a very emotional period. What you think is love may just be residual effects of that emotional experience. - But I know I love him. - Then it's even more important that you go away for a couple of weeks. If he loves you he'll follow you. Trust me this one last time. All right, doctor. - What about your fee? - I know where to reach you, I'll send a bill. You're wonderful, Dr. Schaffhausen. And I'll never forget what you've done for Freddy. And I'm sure Freddy will never forget what you've done. That I'm rather sure of myself. Telegram for you, Miss Walker. In regard to your letter, our founder Doctor Emil Schaffhausen has been dead since 1927. Please take my luggage back to the hotel. How's it going, fellas? Where's Freddy? Oh Freddy! He tried to get away, so we made a paratrooper out of him. He made his first jump about a half hour ago. Can you hear that train whistle? There goes your bet. Janet's on it. - I don't believe it. - See for yourself. I tried to call you at the chateu. Look at this. The Doctor's a fake? - He lied to us? - Yes, but why would he do it? To get your money! He's probably a confidence man! How terrible! - Oh my legs are going numb again. - Freddy, you mustn't let that happen! - They're gone. - Freddy, please get up! I can't. I've been betrayed by everybody, even you. I've never betrayed you! You left without even saying goodbye to me. Only because the doctor insisted. Don't blame it on him. You're just as phony as he is. Oh Freddy, don't say that. You promised to love me and then you ran out. You're... Beatrice all over again. I do love you! I swear it! Stand up! Walk to me! Come to me and let me prove it! Oh no. You're not gonna tear me apart again like that. Darling, I will not disappoint you. Please, please, come to me! Janet, don't let me down. I won't! My beloved! My darling! My sweetheart! - My lover! - Be good to me. I will, I will! M. Jameson! M. Jameson, wake up! - Andre, what's wrong? - You would be wise to hear the news lying down. - M., all is lost. - What do you mean? The Jackal has been seen coming out of Miss Walker's room this morning. - Don't worry about the jackal, I removed his fangs. - It is not his teeth that worry me. Miss Walker was with him. - But I put her on the train. - Then somebody took her off. They spent the night together. Of course, there is always the chance that nothing happened. Perhaps they played cards. Or read books. I understand that Americans are very strange in that respect. Freddy, in that respect, is a true Frenchman. Freddy is in this respect a true Frenchman. Then all is indeed lost. It is the Jackal. No longer the Jackal, Andre. He is now the Lion. No, M., at heart he is still a jackal. Ne, monsieur, u srcu je još šakal. And there is only one way to deal with him. This Luger ... Was once the personal property of Hermann Göring. His are the only fingerprints on it. Even if they trace it to him, what can they do? Andre, my friend, we have had a long and successful reign. We must now accept defeat graciously. My only regret is that he achieved his victory at the expense of miss Walker. And for what he did to her. I am almost tempted to let you use Mr Göring's gun. I said "almost". He won't let me loosen the wheels of his car. He won't let me call Rene the Knife. He won't let me use this gun. How does he expect law and order to prevail? Congratulations. Never thought you'd win, but you did it. You are now king of the mountain. King of the mountain? I'm just a rat from the gutter. I ruined that girl's life last night, I really (unintelligible ) her up for good. Freddy, I've heard of people growing a third set of teeth... Is it possible that you're developing a conscience? I don't know about that but I hate my guts for what I did to her. How can I be so crummy to a girl that nice? What kind of life can she look forward to? Married to a bum like me. Married? You're looking at a picked peach, Dad. And it's all your fault. You and your highbrow philosophy. There she was, mine for the taking. Waiting for me. And all of a sudden I can't touch her. I'm in love with her. She's not a broad anymore, she's a... Rembrandt painting. Michelangelo statue. She's a Stradivarius violin. How do you go to bed with a museum? And what did I do? I take her out and marry her. That poor dame's got me for a husband. Don't feel so sorry for her. Women marry men to reform them. That's what makes them happy. And with a rat like you she faces a lifetime of extasy. Freddy, before our honeymoon even begins. I want you to know that I grew up in a home where the husband is the boss. Yes, dear. - I want to be and so with us. - Yes, dear. - And that's how I want it to be with us. - Yes, dear. When you come home from the soap factory where we've arranged a job for you... At the beautiful apartment that mother picked out it will be your castle. - You will be the boss. - Yes, dear. - Mr. and Mrs. Benson? - Yes? Complements of Mr Lawrence Jameson. - Darling, there's a peach in one glass. - Yes, that one's for me. - Who is Mr. Jameson? - A friend of mine. Probably the best friend I ever had. - To Mr Jameson! - Yes, dear. She is a blonde in a green chiffon dress, just arrived downstairs. You are a man of the world with great knowledge and experience. May I ask you a question? Of course. Who is happier? M. Benson, married, settled down with one woman? Or you? Footloose with many women. That's a very easy question to answer. M. Benson is happier. Compared to him, I am miserable. But a man must learn to live with his misery. END
