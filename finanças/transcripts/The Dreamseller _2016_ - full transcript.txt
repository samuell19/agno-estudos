Good morning, Mr. Júlio César. Mr. Julio! How are you, sir? Good to see you, sir. Good morning, sir. DOLLAR STOCK PURCHASE Sir? Sir? - Doctor, did you do it? - I tried everything. Are you going to give up? I did what I could. We've been doing this for hours. You're a psychologist. Convince him not to jump. He's also a psychologist. A renowned psychologist. Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Are you going up there? Are you? I bet he's going to die. Thank you, my friend. Hey, boss! Get away from me. I'm going to jump. - I'm going to kill myself. - Hey! I'm eating! Can you please not disturb me? I mean, I'm sorry. Do you want a bite? Are you crazy? Everything is okay. If he jumps, I'll let you know. I swear. I'll take care of this. I got rid of them. Now it's up to you. Jump! Isn't that what you want? Don't overthink it. Trust me, if you want to get shattered, just jump. - There. - Okay, I can hear it. We're live in front of the San Pablo building where a man wants to jump from the 21st floor. Every four seconds, someone tries to commit suicide. Did you know that? Another one. Now, it's interesting, a suicidal person is a killer. What did you call me? A killer. He kills himself first, of course, but he ends up killing everyone that is still alive. His family. - His children... - Shut up! - Is that your son? - I said shut up! Why are you so annoyed? I thought I was crazy. - Why does it matter what I say? - Please. - Get out of here. Let me do... - What you don't want to do. What are your philosophical, religious, scientific beliefs for you to defend the theory that death is the end of existence? If you're really gonna jump, you better be sure, right? Where did you hear that? Google? Keep your city clean. Do you like it? You can borrow it if you want. But if you're really gonna jump, don't. It could stain. Are you gonna judge me by the way I look? Or because of my ideas? Look at you. Stuck in your emotional cage. Ignorant to misery greater than yours. Who told you you can't carry the weight of your losses? You don't know what I lost! And you don't know what I lost. I respect your pain. It's only yours. It is the only thing that you can really feel right now. And I admire your courage. - Courage? - Of course! Imagine throwing yourself from this height, crushing your body in exchange for a quiet night in the loneliness of a grave. You really have to be brave. Can you feel your heartbeat? It's almost like it's going to explode out of your chest, right? It's screaming, asking you to stop being so self-centered. Whatever it is that you want to find down there… you are having some doubts up here. I don't have any doubts. What do you really want? To die. Suicidal people don't want to kill themselves. They want to kill their pain. But if that's what you want, go ahead. The decision is only up to you. What are you? A psychologist? A psychologist? No. A psychiatrist? A religious person? A priest? A pastor? Or you're just crazy? That might be it. I play on the crazy team. I'm a dream seller. I sell what money can't buy. Courage for the insecure. Confidence for the phobic. Common sense for the unwary. If that made you nervous, imagine if you had actually jumped. What about the suicidal? - What about them? - What do you sell? A comma. A little comma. So they can continue to write their story. Even when the world collapses on them. Sir? Is everything all right? All right? No, Jurema, it's not all right. The world is collapsing on us. Can't you see? Now bring Roger. We heard that he's leaving right now. We are going to try live footage. Sir, what made you want to jump? And you? Why did you save him? Are you a relative? Good luck, my friend. Wait for me! Wait! I think that was my share of exercise for the week. Thank you. Relax. Everything is all right. It's over. Listen. My home is humble, but that's all I have to offer. Thank you. Where are you going, then? Home? Just for tonight. You can get some rest, and tomorrow you can do whatever you want. Is it far? We're here. Where? What? Your house. Where is it? Are you serious? Yes. Here? Here. You said we were going to your house. Where is your house? My house is the world. I'm right here. Come on. Please. No. It's your bed. I can't… Tonight it's yours. Please, don't refuse my offer. Thank you. I didn't catch your name. Júlio César. Nice you meet you, Júlio César. Nice to meet you. And yours? Boss! Excuse me. You're probably thirsty. Is something wrong with the water? Call Heitor. Relax, Mellon. We are early. It doesn't matter. Is it him? No. Mellon, my friend! What a surprise! What can I do? The goals were too optimistic. We are in a crisis. That's not an excuse. You promised to reach these goals. One dollar and sixty cents per share. It's only ten cents less per share. The goal was one dollar and sixty cents. Mellon, what's going on? You know these cents are costing me millions, Heitor. Without profit, the market will eat us alive. We are going to reach this goal. I just need time. I... You didn't cut expenses or increase revenue. What did you want? Mellon, what are you going to do? Stop production? Fire my employees? You can't do that. There are more than 1500 families. Mellon, we are friends. Yes, we are. My friends are weak. You're out. Good morning, Júlio César. Did you sleep okay? I think so. I'm not sure. Yesterday is gone. We have today ahead of us. You can do whatever you want with it. I'm hungry. Me too. I know a great place. Nice to meet you, Super Ego. Bartolomeu. But you can call me Honey Mouth because I like to drink. - What? - Honey. Honey Mouth. - What kind of honey is that? - Alcohol. What time, boss? - Soon, Bartolomeu. - So where is it? Where is it? I'm hungry. Relax, Bartolomeu. Relax. You're famous, Super Ego. MYSTERIOUS MAN CONVINCES FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST JÚLIO CÉSAR NOT TO JUMP I'm done. My friend, if everything needs to be okay around us so we can have some joy, then we are slaves to circumstance. It's over. Don't overreact. Overreact? I'm a renowned psychologist. Would you go see a psychologist that tried to jump from the 20th story of a building? Huh? Would you? Twenty-first floor. Whatever. I'm dead. It could be worse. Would you rather be in his place? Poor guy. It's horrible to lose your dad like that. Why are you all so distraught? Why are you so distraught? Despair doesn't honor the dead. This man, like all of us here, lived amazing moments. I'm sure he cried, loved, failed, lost, achieved. What is he doing? You are sad about his absence because you're letting him die in the only place where he needs to be alive, inside of all of you. What about the memories? What mark did this man leave on your emotions? Where did he influence your paths? What were his reactions that influenced the way you see life? A wake can be a place for tears. Above everything else, it should be a place for praise, reminiscence. A tribute to the person who is gone. So, I ask you. Tell me… tell me who this man is. Tell me what he meant in your lives. He was a good man. He was tough sometimes, but he was also emotional. He was loyal. He knew, better than anyone else, how to overcome. He fell many times, but he would always get back up. He was… my best friend. Then honor your dad. Honor your dad by facing your fears. Be generous, creative, honest. Live your life with wisdom. If he could, I'm sure your dad would say… "Don't give up on your dreams, son." Don't be afraid of the path… be afraid not to move forward. Forgive me, my friend. And your son? - You have a son, right? - I thought we were going to eat something. - I already ate. - Yeah, I saw that. Nervous Mouth. Who are you? - Me? - Yeah. What? You don't know? The boss is a genius. He hypnotizes people. He doesn't hypnotize anyone. Is it a Socratic method? A philosophical investigation technique that leads the person to reflect and discover their own values? A number of questions reveal the contradictions in the way the person thinks. Who are you? For real? Maybe you should ask yourself who you are, Júlio César. Why don't you come with us? We can try to figure it out together. Stop, kid! Hey, kid! Catch him! Boss? Wait, kid. Come here. Wait. Calm down. Calm down, kid. Stop. - Stop! - Let me go! - Let me go! - Calm down. Thanks. Now give him to me. Just a moment, please. Ma'am, are you sure about this? He stole my purse. Let the boy go. Or you want me to arrest you too? We are all already stuck in this social system. Excuse me? Boss? Prison is not fun. Trust me. Let him go. The first to benefit from forgiveness is the one who forgives. Not the forgiven. He's old enough to be your grandson, right? Never mind. Excuse me? I'm sorry. Thank you. Are you going to fall for that? He's a thief, a criminal. And this guy with this beard? He looks crazy. Good luck, son. You're all crazy. The dream of honesty. Are you hungry, kid? It's on me. Hey… Stop looking, dude. Thank you. So that's how you survive? Begging? Sometimes. Yeah. I can help you. You? To achieve the dream of self-knowledge? No. I don't think so. Just look at this as the most intense psychological experience of your life. What do you have to lose? Everyone deserves a second chance, Júlio César. Let's go! Come on! Hurry! What's going on? - I know. - What? I know some people. - What people? - They can help. They live nearby. Are you talking about hit men, boss? Come on. Who were those men? It's a long story. We can leave now, right? Good afternoon. How are you? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, the prominent musician, Júlio César. I'm going to let you guys improvise a song for them. Excuse me? What? Do as I say, Júlio César. Improvise a song for them. Good luck. Come on. What do we do now? What do you mean? Is he serious? I… One, two, three, go! Hi, my friend. I brought some friends today. They are cheering everybody up. Can you hear them? Horrible, right? One day at a time, my friend. One day at a time. Hey! Listen, Jurema. Can you hear it? You knew this was going to happen, right? Someone doesn't die when their heart stops beating. They die when they don't feel important anymore. Each window is a family. Losses, tears, dreams. Which one would be your window, Júlio Céasar? Mine? Why don't you go back home? Why don't you go back to yours? To your family? I had a family. I think about them every single day. But you can go back, right? I can't. I can, but I rather not. They would kill me. What about you, kid? What made you go to that window on the 21st floor? I don't know what to do. Júlio? What did you do to me? Nothing that wasn't already inside of you. João. João is my son's name. - João. - Yeah. I always thought… I always wanted him to be the best. You know what I mean? At school, soccer, everything. The best. And he would try and try, and it was never enough for me. It was never enough for me. My son didn't understand. He was a kid. He couldn't understand. Now he's grown up, and he gave up on me. Or I gave up on him. I'm not sure. We actually gave up on each other. And I don't know who my son is anymore. Of course you do. I don't know anything anymore. But that's a great starting point, my friend. Yes. Maybe. I… I never told him how I feel. - Why don't you tell now? - That's what I'm doing, right? Tell him. I'm not ready. That's okay. We still have a long way ahead of us. This nation is sick. The obsessive need for power has infected the political class. This was last month at an event sponsored by us. The only ones worthy of power are the ones who don't want it. Look at the last uploads. Something that looked like a one-off event is becoming an unbelievable force. A homeless man who preaches about our world is gaining thousands of followers every day. His last video, in which he attacks the consumerist view and the corporate world, went viral and is raising awareness. People have become uninhibited in front of their devices, but not in front of real people. Over a million views in two days. There's more. The fashion world was not created to promote the well-being of society. That was yesterday when we launched our fashion magazine. Then why is it destroying women's self-esteem? Why aren't there chubby women in fashion shows? Women with big noses? You guys are not taking this seriously, right? - It's not them… - What do you mean? Look at what this lunatic is doing to our company's image. He's out to get us. Listen, I think this is personal. We are the largest commercial conglomerate in Latin America. The largest in the world. What this bum thinks of the hardships of the world doesn't affect us at all. He is very popular, Roger. The schools should educate thinkers and not repeaters. We have to live the dream of being brave, gentlemen. And it's not only online. Check this out, Roger. Roger, this won't last a week. The press is after this bum. They want to interview him. They call him the Dream Seller. Dream Seller. WE SELL DREAMS No one deserves to be a slave in a democratic society. - No one. - I really appreciate your concern. But I'm already taking care of this. It's just a matter of time. The problem is that people want to hear what he has to say. People? What kind of people? All kinds of people. What happened to the lecture with the seller? Where's the auditorium? What is this place? We're here. It's here? But this is a cemetery. Follow me, please. I ask which one of you… will be the richest man in the cemetery. In the cemetery? What are you talking about? What do you mean by that? Don't be scared. I'm sure many of you came here searching enlightenment for your business. Am I right? New leadership methods. I have a handout ready for each one of you. They are spread out around you. The tombstones. You can start. I'll start, then. To my kind and sweet husband. To my dear father. To my unforgettable brother. Look carefully. You will find the best leader's manual. The system crushes companies that aren't efficient enough. Right? Insignificant ones. None of that. The system doesn't crush the companies. It crushes their leaders. I know how much business success costs. Maybe, like you, I was also a businessman. Maybe, like many of you, I also had a Ferrari. The boss has a Ferrari. I was very careful when I selected you for our lecture. I wanted the best. The most successful. The most powerful. And here you are. Identifying the characteristics of a successful businessman is not hard. Who has headaches? Please, raise your hand. Muscle pain? Who wakes up exhausted? Who suffers from problems that haven't even happened yet? Who has a hard time putting up with slow people? Who explodes because of minor problems? By the look on your faces, I see that you are all very successful. Aren't you the elite of society? So why do you have such a horrible quality of life? Where is the happiness that the system promised for those who reach the pinnacle of capitalism? The secret to having success… is to achieve what money can't buy. Are you crazy? Do you have any idea how much we were going to make with this contract? Always one step ahead, Mellon. One step ahead. You know that. You didn't have the right to stop bidding without talking to me first. It may be your group, but I'm the one who runs this company. - Without talking to you first? - Yes. You didn't have the right. Who do you think you are? Excuse me? You want to make deals by embezzling funds from companies? Associating with these politicians. Are you trying to deceive me? Play me for a fool? Betray the only guy who gave you a chance, who trusted you from the start? Great. Play me for a fool, betray me. But do it right. Are you crazy? I'm the only one in this company who still trusts you. I saw the operation! I saw the hidden accounts! What accounts? That is completely fake, Mellon. That's fake. For crying out loud, anyone who sees... It's going to take months to fix your mess. Months. You don't understand. This... I was going to tell you, because… Excuse me. Jurema. They are here. Thank you, my friend. Were you going to tell the auditors too, Roger? Because I think they already know. Always one step ahead, am I right? Imbecile. BEATRIZ IT ALREADY STARTED. ARE YOU COMING??? I'm going to try to figure this out. Thank you, Mellon. And after that, you're done. Good afternoon. MELLON LINCOLN DEDICATED FATHER AND HUSBAND Mom? Go to sleep, honey. Go to sleep. Dad? You missed it, Daddy. Dad had an engagement. I waited for you. I know, Julieta. - Daddy promises that... - You always promise. Can you give Daddy one more chance? Hey, master. Master. Yeah, sometimes I also wake up tired. I have headaches. Look. - I'm going bald. You can see it, right? - Yes. Do I also get a Ferrari? Yes? - Run! - Go! - Master, are you okay? - Yeah. Dimas? Dimas? Hello? Yes? Great. And? How is he? How is he? He's not doing very well. They are taking care of him. How about you? Go home, Júlio César. Your family needs you. What are you talking about? You don't know anything about my life. And you don't know anything about mine. Do you think you can do it? Run from yourself for the rest of your life? You just have to look in the mirror. You can't. I know. Go back home. - What are you doing here? - It's my house. - Don't be ridiculous. - Where's João? - Get out of here! - I just need to… I just need to talk to João! - He's not here. - Don't lie to me. He's not here, Júlio César. Did something happen to João? Tell me! Did something happen to my son? You should've jumped. You should've jumped, you bastard. I just need to talk to my son. Where is he? Your son disappeared. There is evidence that the boy was a victim of an attack and not a random shooting. The target, however, was not him. It was the social rioter that a lot of people have been calling the Dream Seller. Security footage from a gas station shows images of the man a few hours before the attack. The police think it might be part of a conspiracy. Hey! Hi. Hey, sir. Hey! Oh! Who are you? What do you want? I have a proposition for the man you follow. The Dream Seller. I don't know anything, okay? I've heard he lives here. Oh. If you want a lecture, a seminar, a workshop, he doesn't do that anymore, okay? He doesn't want to be a business guru anymore. That's not it. I need a minute of your time. No way. Why not? It's a tribute. - A tribute? - Like a tribute. It's on a TV show. There is no censorship, no script. You can say what you want. - I already said no. - Millions of people would hear you. Dimas could've died because of me. Do you get that? I do. So why don't you report these people? That way, they'll leave you alone. Is he better? He'll be okay. He's a strong boy. I listened to you. Can you listen to me at least once? I said no. It would be good for a lot of people. For hundreds, thousands of people. People with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. My son. You want to know why I was up on that ledge? Because I failed. Me. A mental health specialist. Because of my arrogance, my ego, I wasn't able to save my son. Me. You… you can, with your words… do… You can do this. You have to do this. It's a great honor, sir. Fifteen minutes for the live broadcast on national TV. Trust me. Just say what needs to be said. One step ahead, my friend. Always one step ahead. How are you, Roger? You two know each other? Shall we, gentlemen? Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Good afternoon. It's with great pleasure that we present the most complex and innovative person that emerged from this society in the last decades. A man that, without a credit card, without a marketing team, without money and social titles, managed to achieve the prestige that many politicians with public backing have not achieved. The fame that is being envied by the most successful celebrities. An internet sensation. Look at that, Super Ego. The boss deserves it. Ladies and gentlemen, I now present… the Dream Seller. Many… bow before kings… because of their power. Others… bow before millionaires… because of their money. And others… bow before celebrities because of their fame. I, With great humility… bow before you. I don't deserve this tribute. What do you mean you don't deserve it? Of course you deserve this tribute. Big screen. The tribute starts now. What is that? Can you confirm that the man in the footage is you? Master. Master manipulator, ladies and gentlemen. Over ten million followers. This immoral man became so successful and so famous in such a short amount of time by being… mentally ill. Very good. Now talk about the followers. And your followers? Do they have anything to say? The renowned psychologist Júlio César Lambert. Ladies and gentlemen, a professor from the university. Be honest, Doctor, what would your students say if they knew you spent the last few days following a schizophrenic man? Are you going to keep making a fool of yourself? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Are you? Of course not. Say something, master. Speak. Am I psychotic? Am I crazy? Disturbed? Maybe. Maybe I am all of those things. All of those things and more. But we are all a little bit crazy. I am the psycho who accused the social system of being sick, creating sick people and a sick society. The risk in seeking success is forgetting to enjoy the small things. Small moments. Neglecting loved ones. Promises. Don't. Promises are made to be kept. I have to get that. No. No, you don't. - What you need... - Just a minute. What's up? No. No way. Mom… - Honey, I... - So schedule a meeting. Yes, right now. Of course. Bye. Daddy, me and Mommy would rather wait for you. No, absolutely not. - But, Dad... - You should go now. Have a safe trip. My past is my tormentor. It doesn't allow me to go back. In reality, we are all traitors. We betray our dreams. Our weekends. Vacation. And most importantly… we betray the time we wasted. When we should've been with our loved ones. Trapped in my heart are all the kisses and hugs I couldn't give. The conversations I didn't have time for. On that day, the man who valued trivial things… who despised essential things died. On that day, Mellon Lincoln died. I can't go back in time. But I can start over. Master. Master! I didn't know. I'm sorry. I have betrayed you. I ignored you. You didn't betray me, Júlio César. You betrayed yourself. After being presumed dead and with a fortune evaluated at 50 billion dollars, the businessman Mellon Lincoln was the third richest man on the Forbes list in 2013. He's the owner of more than 200 companies, including airlines, banks, fashion retails, IT companies, and construction companies. It is 2:43 p.m. In another part of town, an emotional story. This is live footage. Don't get near me! Dad? Get out of here! Leave! João, I know how you feel. Don't do it, son. Don't call me son! Do you know how I feel? Here? Now? Do you? No! You think I'm not brave enough? Give me your hand. I don't care about what you think. I don't care about anything. I want to leave. I want to leave. I want to disappear. Give me your hand, son. Please. I won't give you my hand. I'll give you nothing. I don't want to be a burden for you and mom anymore. - You were never a burden? - Weren't you gonna jump? Weren't you going to jump? No. You weren't. You are a perfect man. A perfect man wouldn't allow himself to have a flaw… that is so grotesque. That's what I am to you. A failure. A mistake. I never considered you a mistake. Never. I am the mistake, not you. You never did anything wrong, son. - Let's get out of here. - I never did anything wrong. João, come here! I disappointed you every time, right, Dad? Relax. This time won't be any different. Don't say that. Forgive me. Forgive me, son. Give me a chance. There are no more chances. - Don't say that. You can't… - There's nothing left. João. João, look at me. João. Give me your hand. Let's get out of here. João, come on, son. João. I'll jump first. - What did you say? - That I'll jump first. I won't know how to live without you. Don't be stupid. Wait! We just need time, son. Let me help you. There's nothing you can do for me. There is. A comma. I can sell you a comma… so you can continue to write your story. Even when the world collapses on you. I bought a comma.
