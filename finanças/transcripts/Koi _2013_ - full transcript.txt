Yano-san! The trigger... I pulled the trigger. Don't try to talk. I want... ..to die like this. Keep your back straight. When you pull the trigger, even if it's scary... ..don't close your eyes. Shoot. Yano-san! Fumiko-san! When I finally found Yano Fumiko, after years of searching,... ..she only had a month left to live. She was a murderer. Feb. 28, 1972, Karuizawa At the time, Yano Fumiko was a fourth year student in college. She pointed a gun towards a certain man... ..and pulled the trigger. KOI~Love~ It happened the same day all of Japan was glued to their televisions... ..watching the standoff that was taking place in the very same Karuizawa.* (*The Asama-Sansou Incident - a hostage crisis involving leftist radicals.) The gunshot, like the screaming in her heart, was drowned out... ..by the gunfire of the United Red Army. The public was too preoccupied to notice a murder caused by romantic entanglements. She admitted to all the charges... ..and her trial was soon over. She was sentenced to 15 years. I learned about her three years ago. I was asked by my former publisher to write a book... ..on the after effects of the Asama-Sansou Incident. Excuse me. You're Yano Fumiko-san, right? I'm a writer, Torikai. I would like to speak with you. I found out about you by reading old news articles. About what happened 38 years ago. I think you have the wrong person. I understand it's unpleasant having this brought up all of the sudden. Please leave me alone. I'm not trying to write a sensational story. I believe... ..I've already payed for my crime. That was the first time I had seen such sorrow in someone's eyes. I wanted to learn the truth buried in those eyes. That thought stayed on my mind until three years later. I received a letter from Yano Fumiko. Come in. Excuse me. Nice to see you again. What beautiful roses. I had no idea you were hospitalized. I have been so for three months. All your books are excellent reports. Can I use your flower vase? I'm sure you think this is an inappropriate room for me. Such a large room. Not at all. I was moved here last week from a five person room. I don't have any family to leave what little savings I have anyway. So I splurged. I wanted to at least spend my last month in peace. I have uterine cancer. There's nothing they can do for me. That's what I get for ignoring it. Yano-san... Please have a seat. Not everything I said in court was true. I have a very large secret I must tell. Or the truth of what happened will never be understood. But, I... I didn't want it to become public. I had something to protect. Something to protect? I was walking under the cherry blossoms on my way here. Isn't it beautiful? Yes, it's lovely when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. I don't have much time left. I will tell you everything. Spring, 1971 I have an appointment with Professor Katase of Seishou University. I'm sorry, your name is? I'm Yano, from Meijou University. Please wait here. Yano Fumiko-san? Are you Katase-sensei? I suppose I'm not the type of person you were expecting? No, it's not that. I'll drink this one. Nice to meet you. I'm Katase Shintarou. It's good. Umm... I hear you're an exceptional English Literature student? No, I'm nothing special. I've been given the opportunity to translate a novel by a new British author. Well, it already has quite a reputation. I've never had any experience with translation. You just need to write down what I say. So it's just dictation? I would like to have it finished this summer. Can you start coming next week? Next week? Every Saturday, from one to six. I will cover travel expenses, and pay you 30,000 yen a month. 30,000!? Is that too little? It's too much. That's two months of rent. But I just met you... But I've already taken a liking to you. It's decided then. Is that a new student? I'll introduce you. My wife Hinako. Hina as in Hinamatsuri.* (*Doll Festival) She will be assisting my translation. Yano Fumiko-kun. Nice to meet you. Fumiko... Then I'll call you Fuu-chan. Your hands are cold. It feels nice. I like your hands. The people of Okinawa are in deplorable conditions. When will we catch up with the times? What are you talking about? Clear out of here. This is a disturbance. We'll do it at your house? I have no desire to waste my weekends working in a boring classroom. It certainly is an erotic novel but it's not pornography. It has class. You could call it an unorthodox romance novel. When it gets published in Japanese it's going to attract a lot of attention. What's it's name? "Rose Salon" Welcome. Come in. What's the matter? Come in. Excuse me. Coffe? Tea? No, I'm fine. I'll make it. Don't worry about it. Sit down. Hello, Fuu-chan. Hello. Have you eaten? Huh? Have you eaten lunch yet? Yes. Oh. Yesterday I made pork stew. Pork stew? Yes. it's really good. If you get hungry have some for a snack. I'm going to take a shower. Okay. Hinako's pork stew is the best. Hey... Yes? What is all that for? I thought I should be prepared for anything. I think I'm starting to figure you out. Here, this one is for you. I can have it? Yes. Write in it however you like. Let's start then. "I was transported, confused..." "..and out of myself..." "Feelings so new were too much for me." "All my senses were burning up." "I felt my body trembling..." "..like a violent wave flowing through me." That's a lovely phrase, isn't it? "Whilst thinking of the man I loved..." "..even sleep was an extension of my pleasure." "The next morning..." Is it about time to stop? Oh, it's already this late. Handa-kun just called. Asking if we wanted to go out to Shibuya. You want to come along? Don't try to lure her in. We're just starting to get along well. You go out with him tonight. But I want to have fun with everyone. Then next time all three of us will go to Rosso E Nero. I promise. Okay then. Make sure you eat that pork stew. Thank you. Shin-chan. What? I might stay out tonight. Have fun. Here, eat. It's good. It's delicious. She's a rather strange lady but she's not bad at cooking. This is my first time meeting people like you. It's like a different world. I don't know how to act. I'm just a poor teacher. Hinako is the one who comes from a different world. We were born in very different circumstances. So we had no choice. We had to elope. Elope!? Hinako is... ..she's from the family that owns "Nikaidou Navy." The Nikaidou Financial Group!? Their family were originally noblemen. A fatherless student like me trying to struggle his way through school... ..I was treated like a stray dog. Well then... How were you able to capture a princess. How do you think? Um... You were her tutor and became friendly with her? That's a very ordinary idea. Sorry. My plan was to get employed by a well paying trading firm after graduating. My mother, before she died, told me to become a teacher. So I stayed behind in the laboratory giving lectures. Then a senior of mine... ..told me to come to an interesting bar in Shinjuku. Hey, Katase! Over here! This is a shady place. What will you drink? Hina-chan, stop being ridiculous. This is my favorite way to drink. Sorry about that. She's a weird one. It's good. Will you take me away from this place? Where? Anywhere. If I stay here I'll drink myself to death. Fine, let's leave right now. It wasn't until later... ..that I learned she was a runaway from a noble family... ..working in such a place. Can I ask you a rude question? Go ahead. Do you know the person... ..who invited Hinako-san out tonight? Are you talking about Handa? Yes. He's my student. He's Hinako's boyfriend. Boyfriend!? I mean it just like it sounds. But Hinako-san... ..said she might stay out tonight. Fuu-chan... ...you'll come to understand eventually. About me and Hinako. It fits perfectly. You don't think it's a bit too short? How is it? She's hot. It suits her well, doesn't it? Please, don't stare at me. Hey, Shin-chan. She wears the same size clothes and shoes as me. You think we look like twin sisters? You seem to be having fun. Hinako only has brothers. I wanted a little sister like Fuu-chan. That's Handa. He's a second year student at my graduate school. He's a good looking man, right? He's not all that smart... ..but he gets excellent grades on his tests. That's contradictory. It's like having a talent for gambling just because you're lucky. This prawn is unbelievable. Your mouth is all sticky. What an insatiable appetite. Are we having a double date tonight? Let me introduce you. This is the owner of this restaurant. Soejima-san. Nice to meet you. I'm Yano. This is my assistant I'm always bragging about. I wish I could have such a charming assistant. You better not touch her. She's my cute little sister. You're further arousing my interest. Too bad. She's Shin-chan's partner tonight. I'm leaving before I turn into a clown. I'll have dessert prepared for you. Please enjoy yourselves. I've known Soejima-san since we were children. He also has a vacation home in Karuizawa. We always socialize together there. It's a small world amongst the rich and famous. Yes, and it was also Soejima-san who taught Shin-chan how to hunt. Hunting? Like hunting animals with a gun? Yes. I can't imagine Sensei holding a gun. I have a good idea. Let's bring Fuu-chan with us this summer to karuizawa. Yes, that would be good. We can work on our translation without worrying about the time. Am I the only one being left out? You know she'll be too busy for you. You'll come right. I'll think about it. Sorry. I'll need to be leaving soon. Before the trains stop running. I'll take you to your apartment. No, I'll be fine. Let him take you, because I'm going to Handa's place. I'll be very courteous to her. This guy. You're sweating. Your nose is so soft. Thank you. I'll have this dress cleaned and return it. No need. I'll take it back with me now. Go get changed. But... It's fine. Okay, I'll be right back. Your nose is so soft. Are you changed? Sorry, I'll be right there. Please don't look! It's dirty! It looks perfectly clean. No! No! Stop! This brings back memories. It's just like the apartment I used to live in. Can I come in? You did it on purpose, didn't you? I feel like... ..I've gone back in time to my college days. Do you want to return to your youth so badly? No, I don't. It wasn't a very happy time. When I entered college it wasn't even ten years after the war ended. All of Japan was poor so I didn't even realize how poor I was. I suppose that was a bit of blessing in disguise. I'm an illegitimate child. I didn't have a father. My mother was unfortunate. She was toyed around with by a bad guy and then abandoned. That's awful. After the war, my mother had to raise me by herself. She was a servant at an inn. The owner of that place fell in love with her. Basically, she became his mistress. But honestly, I didn't dislike him being around. He was just a simple man, running a small inn. He wasn't very wealthy. But he was able to provide some small amount of happiness to us. My mother died when I was in my second year of high school... ..but even after she died... ..he continued to provide me a small allowance. How is he doing now? He's dead. I think he was waiting for me to finish graduate school. I don't want you to misunderstand this but... ..honestly, I was relieved when he died. I was finally free to live how I wanted. It was around that time as well... ..that I met Hinako. So as soon as I became free... ..I became this depraved sort of man. Sensei, you are not depraved. Neither is Hinako... Are you bothered by Handa? It doesn't bother you? Hinako being with another man. If anyone tries to hurt or restrict her... ..I won't allow that. But if they can make her happy... ..I welcome them. They know... ..I'm the only person she truly loves. Do you think our relationship is twisted? I don't know, but... ..I like both of you. If you turn out the lights... ..it will leave. Thank you, Fuu-chan... ..for liking us. Good night. Katase and his wife... ..were a very special presence in your life. I told you about a moth that flew in, right? Yes. The next morning, when I opened the window... ..there was a dead moth, crushed on the ledge. It's a silly story, but... ..when I saw it ... ..I presumed it was the same moth. I considered it to be proof that that night had really existed. The moth was very dear to me. Until all traces of its remains had vanished... ..I looked at it everyday... ..and remembered the happiness I felt that night. When I think back to it now... ..that was the moment I began my journey... ..that ended with me pulling the trigger. Summer, 1971 Fuu-chan. We're here. How is it? Do you like it? It's wonderful. It looks like a European country house in a photograph. It was originally a guest house... ..but my father gave it to me, and I furnished and decorated it to my tastes. So this is your own personal castle. Yes, this is my private castle only during the summer. No one but my beloved Shin-chan and Fuu-chan can live here with me. Not even Handa-san? No, there is no use for him in this kingdom. How sad. Of course I like Handa-kun, but when I come here... ..I couldn't care less about him. You're weird. Aren't I? I've always been like this. When I come to Karuizawa, there is only one person I can think about. Sensei? I lost my virginity here in Karuizawa. It was during the summer when I was sixteen. Ever since then, when it becomes summer... ..I always come here to sleep with him. Even now? It's strange, but when I was a teenager... ..I believed he had cast a magic spell on me. Does Sensei know about this? There are no secrets between me and Shin-chan. I have never lied to him, not even once. Do you feel no guilt about it? I only sleep with him once a summer. Then it's like I'm free from his spell. I'm weird, right? "I chose the country girl." Why don't you take a break. Ready. Fuu-chan, smile. That took to long. Good morning, Fuu-chan. Good morning. I'm in charge of dinner tonight. What would you like? Let's go out to eat sometimes. We were invited by Soejima-san. The one from that restaurant in Tokyo? Yes. He also has a vacation house near here. Really? It's weird having my back exposed. It's fine. You look beautiful. I'm looking forward to horse riding tomorrow. Fuu-chan. I'm going straight to Soejima-san's place from here. No way... Yes. He was my first person. I never even thought it. I won't be coming home tonight. Take care of Shin-chan. Please don't say something like that. Are you scared to be left alone with Shin-chan? Not at all. Do you want some water? No, I'm fine. I'm going to go to sleep. Hold on to my shoulder. I'm okay. I knew it. Sensei... What is it? I want to live like this... ..with you and Hinako-san forever. Fuu-chan. Good morning. Good morning, Fuu-chan. Good morning. We've been waiting for you to wake up to eat breakfast. I'm not hungry. You don't seem to have a fever. Take some aspirin. I'm fine. I just have a bit of a hangover. So how was it? What? Shin-chan says you were great. Fuu-chan? That's horrible. Fuu-chan? Flower Market Welcome. South Karuizawa Train Station Do you want a drink? Thank you. It sure is hot. Yes. Are you a student? Yes. Are you working part time out here? Well yes, but I'm quitting. What kind of fruit is a quince? It's similar to a large pear. Can you eat it? It's not something you eat. You just enjoy its aroma. It takes fifteen years to grow. If you got married and had a child... ..they would be in middle school. How about it? I'll sell it cheap. Sadly I forgot to bring my wallet. Sorry. Wait. Yes? I'll give it to you. Take it with you. I have no reason to take it. It'll be a memento. In fifteen years when it bears fruit... ..remember that an old man gave it to you in Karuizawa. If you just remember, that'll be enough. Take it. Make sure you plant it when you get home. Understood? What are you doing? I'm waiting for the bus. No more buses are coming. Where are you headed? Furujuku. You can ride with me. Stop imagining things. Who would try to kidnap a girl in a work truck with a logo. I'll walk. Please don't worry about me. You're going to walk five kilometers in the dark? Five kilometers? Do whatever you want. Wait! Fuu-chan? Where were you? We were worried. You're so stupid, Fuu-chan! Do you understand how worried we were? Stupid... Fuu-chan? What is that? It's a quince. I'm going to give it to you as a memento. I'll plant it in the garden tomorrow. After that... ..I'm going back to Tokyo. I... I can't stay here any longer. What are you talking about. Both I... ..and Sensei... ..have betrayed Hinako-san. How can you act so normal about it. Hinako-san, you should be angry. And Sensei, you should be fed up with it by now. How could you... ..put your hands on a girl working for you. I'm not the least bit fed up. Neither is Hinako. I can't simply accept things like this... ..like you two do. Let me go! No, I won't! We both love you. Maybe you can't understand us right now... ..but that's how we really feel. Someday... ..someday you will understand. When this tree produces fruit I'll make quince sake. It's a sweet sake with a very nice aroma. I'm looking forward to it. We'll all three drink together. I was told it would take fifteen years to bear fruit. By that time Fuu-chan will probably be married. Maybe she'll have kids. I want it to be a girl. Yes, it has to be a girl. You can't decide that yourself. So it'll be four of us. Four of us will drink quince sake together in this garden. Hey, what about Fuu-chan's husband? Yeah, I guess so. That bug zapper seems broken. If we have to have it repaired... ..let's ask the electrician that gave Fuu-chan a ride home last night. Good idea. I think the truck said, "Shinano electric." You'll come this evening? Give us a call when you're coming. Shin-chan, I can't figure this out. Discord. What does that mean? Lack of harmony. He's already here? That was fast. It's not the electrician. It's probably the viscount here to pick you up. Oh, I forgot. Sorry, you two eat lunch without me. Who's the viscount? Hinako's father. He comes here for recuperation. They're having lunch together today. Shouldn't you go too? I would prefer never to see his face again. Yes, of course. Ok, next week then, at the gun club. Was it Soejima-san? Yes, I was invited to go clay target shooting. You have a strange relationship with him. Do I? I just simply like him as a person. Right. I'll show you something neat. What's in there? It's a gun that can take down a deer. Hold it. It's heavy. You hold it like this. Hold the grip with your left hand. Press the stock firmly against your shoulder. Hold on to it like that... ..and raise it up. The sight comes naturally in alignment. Get the target... ..right in the middle of the scope. Pull the trigger. Let's go for a change of mood. These are live rounds. Pull this lever, and the magazine comes out. You can load up to four bullets. Push the bolt back until you feel resistance... ..and one bullet is chambered. Now you just need to pull the trigger. Simple, right? I'm scared. I don't want to. It's okay. I'll be watching you. Place your cheek against the rifle and focus through the scope. Keep your feet apart about the same distance as your shoulders. Keep your back straight. When you pull the trigger, even if it's scary, don't close your eyes. Shoot. Try shooting another round. Pull the lever. Push it back again. That's it. Were you scared? We're back. Hinako-san? Hey, Hinako. Oh, you're back. He seemed to be thirsty. Come on. Let's go inside. I'm finished. Could you sign this invoice please? Are we good? I'll come back for payment at the end of the month. I'll pay you now. I don't have any change. I don't need change. I'm just part time, I can't do that. I'll give your shop a call. What's your name? Ookubo. Ookubo-kun. Good job. Thank you. You can wait here until it quits raining. Nobody else is here. I would like to. I haven't asked your name. It's Ookubo. Your given name. Katsuya. Yours? Hinako. "..all of a sudden presented no view before me of anything..." "..but the depth of mystery," "..horror and the sharpest affliction." Let's stop. I can't get in the mood. It's been raining every day. Summer may end like this. Are you going out? Yes, I called a taxi. I'm going to my father's place. You just went the day before yesterday. I'm going to eat with my brother and his wife before they return to Tokyo. Really? With the older brother you hate. What happened? Shin-chan. Why are you trying to pry into everything I do? It's unbecoming of you. Unbecoming? If you have something to say, say it. Stop it you two. Are you meeting Hinako-san? She didn't come home yesterday. I thought maybe... Yes, I've been seeing her. Please, don't get any closer to her. Why? It's a nuisance. Certainly, I'm getting close to Hinako-san... ..but she is approaching me too. Of her own free will. I won't allow it. I don't need your permission. This is between me and Hinako-san. Fuu-chan. What are you doing here? I came to get you. Let's go home. I'm sorry, but go back without me. Can you take some time? I have a thirty minute lunch break. I don't need to eat. You want to take a walk around Kumogaike lake? Yes. I'm going too. I refuse. I want to be with Hinako-san. Not you. I lost Hinako-san. That's what I thought. My special three person relationship that I wanted to last forever... ..was over by the summer. My perfect image of Hinako-san was destroyed. I could accept Hinako-san's playful relationships... ..with the likes of Handa or Soejima. But I found it dirty... ..the way she fell in love like a little girl with Katsuya. I think there was a better option... ..for you and Katase-sensei. If they got a divorce... ..and Hinako and Ookubo became a couple... ..then you could have been with Katase-sensei. I never... ..even thought such a thing. It's only natural... ..for people in love to want to be together. There was no way to make things right. Today... I'm going to tell you all the way to the end. Don't worry about visiting hours. But... I don't have much time left. I want you to know... The real reason I pulled the trigger. February 27, 1972 Yes. Fuu-chan. Hinako-san. How did you get that bruise? Do you have any whiskey? I have some cheap stuff. Don't tell me Sensei did that. Shin-chan... ..started breaking things in the house. When he had broken everything... ..he screamed he would kill me next. I kept trying to stop him. It's okay. You can stay here tonight. I'm going to live with Katsuya. This is the first time I've felt this way. It's not like all my other shallow relationships. I don't even care about sex. I want Katsuya's heart. As long as I have Katsuya... I don't get it! Why are you angry? Do you no longer... ..love Sensei? I love him. I love him. But... ..it's a different type of love. No! Someday I'll explain it to you. Someday. I'm going. Is that you Fuu-chan? Let's leave. There is somewhere I want to take you. Sorry for such short notice. When we ran away together ten years ago... ..we came here. Did you? What I'm about to tell you... ..is a secret no one but Hinako and I know. I always intended to tell you someday. When I think about it now... ..we barely knew each other. We just instantly drowned ourselves in each other's love. We started living together and then eloped. After we exchanged our vows here... ..she told me about it... ..for the first time. She was Nikaidou Tadashi's daughter. It was already too late. What do you mean? I had... I had slept with my own sister. No way... Hinako and I... ..are blood related. We're brother and sister from a different mother. If I had known earlier... ..I never would have approached her. But after we had met... ..we couldn't stand to be apart. Nikaidou Residence Showa 9 (1934) My mother met the Nikaidou family through a connection of hers. She went into service for them... ..for employment and to learn proper manners. This was before the war... ..and he was still a viscount. She was in charge of looking after Hinako's mother... ..who was in poor health. While she was living and working in the Nikaidou house... ..she caught the lustful eyes of Hinako's father. She was forced against her will. Unfortunately... ..she ended up pregnant. Hinako's father... ..already had two other mistresses. Any more would affect the appearances of the family. So she was forced to leave. That was the way things were then. My mother had to just accept the situation. She had neither the courage nor the money for an abortion. She had no choice but to give birth to the child. That... ..was me. When did Hinako-san... ..learn about this? As soon as I realized it, I told her. Here. It's too cruel. Since then I haven't slept with Hinako. If you knew she was your sister... ..then why did you get married? I could not leave her even if it killed me. The only way I could be with her for life... ..was to get married. It was... ..the conclusion we reached after much consideration. Sensei... Hinako is my sister... ..and my wife. She is an inseparable part of me. Finally... ..I feel that I can understand your relationship. Fuu-chan. If I could... ..I would... ..kill that man! February 28, 1972, Karuizawa I wonder how this will turn out. I heard a police captain was shot in the head and killed today. Here's your change. Is that so? Fuu-chan. Why are you here at such a time? It's cold. I have a bit of a cold. It's disturbing. You can hear the gunshots all the way here. Is he here? Yes. Long time no see. That's sensei's chair. No wonder... ..it feels so nice to sit in. Fuu-chan, have a seat. I went with Sensei to Hakone. To that inn you know well. He told me everything. Did he? I knew this day would come. I came here to bring you back. This isn't the place you belong. I don't think Hinako-san belongs with that man either. Be quiet! This isn't a conversation you can help with. It's absurd for siblings to be a married couple. You told him? Yes. I don't think it's particularly repulsive. On the contrary, I find it a beautiful relationship. But... ..in the end, siblings are siblings. What do you know? What those two shared wasn't love... ..it was warped personal satisfaction. I won't forgive you. Stop it, Katsuya. If I was in Katase-sensei's position... ..I'd shoot myself in the head. I think it's you who should be at his side right now. Don't say disturbing things like that. Are you alright? You still have a fever. You better lay down in bed. It's late, so stay here tonight. Go back to Tokyo by train in the morning. Fuu-chan. I'm not going back to Shin-chan. I can't go back... ..anymore. What sort of game is this? Cut it out Fuu-chan. Fuu-chan! Where are you? Stop it! Don't do something foolish. Give the gun to me. Sensei. It's all over. There's no other choice. Give me the gun! It's your fault, Onii-san. You instigated her. What did you call me? Onii-san! (Older brother) Can I not call you that? You bastard... Stop it already! You just wanted to forget she was your sister. Shut up! You were attracted to your own sister. You felt guilty but you still wanted her. You just wanted to divert your feelings of guilt. Am I wrong, Onii-san? What did you do? Stop! After that... ..there was only one happy moment in my life. Sensei hadn't died. He was taken to the hospital and saved. A detective told me so. I quit. What? I won't write a book. I can't do it. I'm glad... ..I was able to tell you my story at the end of my life. Is that good enough? Nothing more than telling your story... ...then dying. Is that really good enough? Both Katase-sensei and his wife are alive. They're still married. It went out of print while you were in prison. This is probably the first time you've seen it? After the incident Sensei quit Seishou University. What saved him, when he had nowhere to go, was that book. Rose Salon won a literary award. Thanks to that, he received offers from a lot of private universities. But the one Sensei choose... ..was a small girl's college in Kamakura. He is still a distinguished professor at that school. Is Hinako-san doing well? Yes. She gave up her entire inheritance... ..and remained with him. He is still in a wheelchair, due to the wound he suffered. But you protected them. Because you never revealed their secret in court... ..they have been able to remain married. Watch from here. You can't see inside through these windows. Coming. I'm a big fan of Sensei. I would like to get his autograph. Excuse my abruptness. Can I have your autograph? Sensei. It's rare to see someone with this book nowadays. What is this lovely smell? Oh, it's quince. It was buried in cold hard ground... ..so it was very hard to get it healthy after we replanted it here. Where did you bring it from? Karuizawa. Would you like to take some with you? I just picked some fruit from it this morning. If it's no trouble. Thank you. I got Katase-sensei's autograph. It's in the back by the dedication. "At the time of this translation..." "..she was always a support to me..." "..and at the same time..." "..she left me a mountain of unforgettable memories." "My irreplaceable assistant,..." "..Yano Fumiko, I thank you from the bottom of my heart..." "..and I dedicate this book to you." Subtitles: occultangle
