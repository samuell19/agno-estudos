Long before our time, the heavenly Zenithians gathered their strength to seal the evil Nimzo behind the gates to Nadiria, but their victory came at the cost of a catastrophic loss of life. Should a villain emerge and succeed in opening these gates to the dark world, the only way to shut them tight once more is with a sword imbued with holy power. That sword must be wielded by a heavenly hero descended from the Zenithian bloodline. SANCHO: SIRE! KING PANKRAZ! IT'S A BABY! A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BABY! PANKRAZ: OH, MY! BLESS THE GODDESS! PANKRAZ: YOU SHALL BE KNOWN AS LUCA. MADA: OH, PANKRAZ! YOU REALLY ARE... GUGH! PANKRAZ: GOODNESS! WHAT IS IT? ARE YOU ALRIGHT, MY DEAR? NOT LONG AFTER GIVING BIRTH, LUCA'S MOTHER, MADA, WAS ABDUCTED BY MONSTERS. *: I HEAR THAT YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE TRAVELING AROUND TOGETHER. RODRIGO: AH, PANKRAZ! I'LL BE IN TOUCH ONCE I FIND THE SWORD. NERA, COME HERE TO PAPA. NERA BLUSHES BRIGHTLY UPON SEEING LUCA. BIANCA: I'M BIANCA. DO YOU REMEMBER ME? *: GO ON! PURR AGAIN, PUSS! BIANCA: LEAVE HIM ALONE! GIVE HIM TO ME! *: THEN YOU CAN HAVE HIM AFTER YOU DEFEAT THE GHOSTS AT UPTATEN TOWERS! BIANCA ATTACKS! 18 POINTS! HAUNTED HOUSEKEEPER ATTACKS! LUCA ATTACKS! DOES 21 DAMAGE! THE HAUNTED HOUSEKEEPER IS DEFEATED! BIANCA: OH! WHAT'S THAT? WHAT A PRETTY BALL! I'LL BET IT'S SOME KIND OF REWARD. WE SHOULD TAKE IT WITH US. LUCA ACQUIRES THE DRAGON ORB! *: FINE. TAKE THE STUPID CAT! BIANCA: YAY! THAT'S GOOD NEWS, ISN'T IT, CAT? NO MORE BULLYING FOR YOU! BIANCA: WE SHOULD GIVE THE PUSS A NAME! HMM... WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CALLING IT PURRCY? PANKRAZ AND LUCA CONTINUE ON THEIR QUEST TO FIND MADA. Is that all you've got, Luca? Far from it! Hey, Purrcy! Wait up! Wait for me! The boy is growing up so fast. Is something the matter, Sancho? No, Your Majesty, I just wish Lady Mada could see her son is all. Indeed. -Come back here! -So do I, Sancho. I've got you now! Ouch... Purrcy? Where are you? Hey, you there. Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. Say, that's a great orb you've got. May I have a look? Luca, we're leaving soon. Coming! My dad's the strongest in the world. You're getting better, Luca. Makes me proud to be your father. Why is this time of year so depressing? What business have you in Coburg? Do not be alarmed. My name is Pankraz. I'm here at His Majesty's request. Right you are! Prince Harry! You must return to Lord Pankraz! No. He's a big old bossy boots. But it's dangerous outside the grounds. Pipe down, Frank, or you'll be sharing your shirt with a frog again! Hey! Who might you be? Oh, I remember now. You're Pankraz's boy. Did he tell you to come and nanny me? Kind of. You must be Harry. You shall call me Prince Harry. I'm second most powerful after the king. Really? Well, my dad's the strongest in the world. You don't say. In that case, you can be my lackey. Race to the castle. -Three, two, one... Go! -Hey! That's not fair! Watch out! -Let go of me! -Stop! How dare you! Release me! Dad! -Let's go. -Wow! He really is strong. Impressive. You gave both Kon and Slon a sound beating. Ladja! You really should keep a closer eye on those boys. Now, give me a show to remember! It's payback time. You're dead meat. Luca! Get up, Luca! No! Luca, listen to me! Dad! A father's love for his son is a precious thing indeed. But nothing lasts forever. Dad... Luca... you must... Dad... Dad! Oh, how your screams delight me. Let me hear some more! Dad! Luca... your mother... is still alive. Please... your mother... Dad! How touching. Dad! Let me go! No. You will live happily ever after as my slave instead. Are you alright, Luca? Did you have another nightmare? Don't worry, Harry. I'm fine. I thought I told you already. You are to call me Prince Harry, lackey. Are you still going on about that? We're both slaves here, remember? I can't help it, I'm royalty. More to the point... We've been stuck here for ten years. Why haven't we escaped? Because it's far too dangerous. How many times have we been over this? Hey! Why are you slowing down? Useless idiot! Hey, you. You guys want out of here? Do you know a way? Oh, yeah. I know plenty of slaves who escaped here in barrels. They were all dead. Dead! If you can't hack it here, they stuff you in a barrel and dump you in the river. That's it! Seriously? Are you sure about this? Dead sure. I'll go it alone if I have to. When you put it like that... Ugh! -What are you doing? That reeks! -Quiet. They'll hear us. What is this gunk? It was floating in there. Is that... what I think it is? If we do this, we have to do it properly. Who put this barrel here? It's suspicious, alright. Urgh! These two stink worse than a pigsty! Toss them! Quickly! Me? We made it. We're alive! I can't believe it! Runaways, are you? Thank you. -Please come again. -I'm hammered! Hey. The coast is clear. -Okay. -Alright. Here, drink this. It'll warm you up. Thank you. You still stink, by the way. Sorry about that. The thing is... It's kind of a long story, but... My name's Dr. Agon. Escapees are welcome here. I opened this pub here on Mount Azimuth to spy on that temple. Isn't that insanely dangerous? It has its risks, but if I do nothing, then disaster will befall us all. It seems Bishop Ladja is planning to open the gates to Nadiria. He wants to bring back Grandmaster Nimzo. Nimzo? He's the ultimate evil, capable of plunging this world into eternal darkness. Countless Zenithians lost their lives sealing him away all those years ago. Ladja... so that's his plan. Looks that way. That's why I'm searching for the heavenly hero, the one who can stop Bishop Ladja. Now... tell me everything you know. Don't stop until you reach Littlehaven. Hey, can you hear me? This is the best I can do. You're on your own from here. Farewell and Goddesspeed... you smelly sods. Halt! Beyond this point is Coburg territory. Outsiders are not permitted. You always were a jobsworth, Frank. Do I know you? Are you still afraid of frogs? Do you remember when I put one in your bed? That was classic! You snobby little... Could it be...? Prince Harry! You're alive! Stand aside, Frank. The monsters on Mount Azimuth are growing in strength. I must inform my father at once. Come on, Luca. Yeah... about that... Aren't you coming with me? It's my dad. His last words are playing on my mind. It's like he was trying to tell me something important. About your mother? I think so. I want to go back to Whealbrook. There's an old cabin there where we used to live. I see. We part ways here then. Take care, Harry. I told you it's Prince Harry. You're certainly a slow learner, lackey. Be off with you. Right. I'll be back in Coburg one day. So, until we meet again. Luca! Ouch... What is it? I... Sorry for not telling you this sooner, but... you see... your father... Pankraz... I believe... no, I know that... he saved my life. What I mean is... if you need anything of me, just ask. I'll do all in my power to help. Ah, Whealbrook. This place hasn't changed at all. Well, Dad, I'm home. It's freezing here! Let's get a fire lit. What is this place? Dad's secret room? And this is... his diary. At long last, the question that has plagued me is answered. Bishop Ladja requires the Zenithian spell to open the gates to Nadiria. That is why he took Mada, she is a Zenithian. This means she is still alive. If I can find the Zenithian sword and the heavenly hero and seal the gates to the dark world, she may yet be saved. Furthermore, I believe Luca is the very hero of heaven that I have been searching for. I don't get it... Me? The hero? Begone, brutish burglar! But this is... my house! Sancho? Those eyes... Master Luca, it's you! Praise be! You're alive! This tastes even better than I remember! There's seconds if you need. Oh, this is a truly happy day! I never gave up hope. I knew you were alive. I knew it! Ladja enslaved me and forced me to build his temple. It was hell. Have you word of Lady Mada? Ladja has her held captive. It says so in dad's diary. She was so close and I never knew. So, you did not see her? How could I? I was a slave! They worked me into the ground every day. What? If anyone can save her, Master Luca, it is you. Me? Zenithian blood flows in your veins. Your eyes are proof of that. You must be the heavenly hero of Zenithia. Don't be ridiculous. Lord Pankraz must have believed so, too. Well, that's what it said in his diary. You see? Your father also said this: the Zenithian sword can only be unsheathed by the true hero. If he were to hurl the heavenly blade into the gates to Nadiria, they will be sealed once more! So, where is this almighty sword then? Worry not. Rodrigo Briscoletti has it. He said so in a letter. So, it does exist. Master Luca, you must go to Mostroferrato and pay Mr. Briscoletti a visit. Mostroferrato? But it'll take weeks. What about all the forests, the caves, the deserts, the monsters? Please, take this. It belonged to your father. Dad's sword. I'm not fit to carry that. Look, I'm not my dad. I'll never make it. And I'm scared... too scared to even think about it. Sancho, can you tell me about my mom? She was a beautiful, intelligent lady. I can barely remember her at all. Come here, Luca. Come to Mommy. Your hands are so warm. On his life, your father swore to save his queen. Luca... you must... I can make it! I will make it! Woo-hoo! Jackpot! Swoosh! What do you want? I don't need a slime for company. I'm really getting the hang of this. Eh? You won't leave me alone, huh? Maybe I'll keep you, then. Come along, Goo. Gootrude! Dad, do you really think I'm the hero? This was a mistake. This whole journey was a big mistake. Just... just try to keep calm. See? I'm not going to hurt you. Just forget we ever came. Ready... steady... run for it! This can't be happening! Huh? Purrcy? Purrcy! It's you! Not far now. What happened here? WHOSOEVER CAN DEFEAT BJØRN THE BEHEMOOSE, I WILL MAKE MY HEIR - RODRIGO BRISCOLETTI So, this Bjørn fella is the one who wrecked the place. Since word got out that Mr. Briscoletti's heirship was up for grabs, we've had dozens of brave men come to take on Bjørn. We never see any of them again, though. Whoa. He's absolutely ginormous. He's made the old sanctuary into his lair. This is bad. What am I to do? A new challenger? A monster master, maybe? He's the one to beat Bjørn! Father! Ah, Nera. A new suitor has just arrived. I'm still against having my husband decided like this. This is not the time! I'm going to ask him to leave. No, stop. Please! Huh? What's that noise? Ouch... Are you alright? Are you...? You're... Nera? Luca... you're alive. Uh-huh! Is something the matter, Nera? You... It cannot be! Luca, we thought you were dead. Nera cried for days on end when she heard. She did? So, do you wish to challenge Bjørn? I never said anything of the sort. If you can defeat Bjørn, I will name you my heir. In other words, you will take Nera's hand. In... in marriage? Quite the prize, eh? Whoa. You're ignoring one important thing. I don't stand a chance against Bjørn. I'm sure you'll be fine. What are you saying? Just look at me. The color of your eyes tells me so. So, you think I'm the Zenithian hero, too? We'll know for sure if you can unsheathe the Zenithian sword. You really have it? Sounds to me like you want to be the hero. The sword is kept in here. Unsheathe it and fulfill your destiny, Hero of Zenithia! It's gone. So, does this mean the sword is in Bjørn's lair now? It would seem that way. Sorry... do you mind if I think this through a little? Luca... Nera. I take it, you've decided not to fight Bjørn. I think it's a battle too far for me. I'm glad. I don't know what I'd do if you were to challenge him. Would you rather I didn't? I mean, if I beat him, then... we'd have to... you know... No, that's not what I mean. Quite the opposite. I'd be absolutely delighted to see you beat that brute. It's just... Delighted? No! Well, yes, but in a general sense. It's got nothing to do with marrying you. Not that I don't want to... Sorry, I really must leave! What just...? This means... She means... We can... Anyone... medicinal herbs, please? -Anyone still got some? -Nope, I'm out. Used mine up. I have some. -Who's that? -Some girl who arrived yesterday. You've grown, Purrcy. Here... here you go. You're a lifesaver. I thought I recognized you for a second there. Huh? You look a lot like the guy who got rid of the ghosts in Uptaten Towers. Where did you hear about that? How could you forget a childhood friend, eh? No way... Bianca? Took you long enough, Luca Erkel Gotha. Bianca! It's really you! -I've heard of Bianca. -What? The mage? They say she can use Kasizzle. Come along. Hey! Where are you going? What? You're not thinking of fighting Bjørn with me, are you? Well, you clearly can't beat him alone. I'd rather you just left it to me. Have I done something to offend you? Of course not. Just don't try following me! Why doesn't he want me to go with him? What's your problem? I don't have a problem. Look, this place is really dangerous. Oh? I never knew you as the chivalrous type. Give it a rest. Over there! Is that...? The Zenithian sword! -With that, you'll be invincible! -Wait! It's not safe! Huh? Too dangerous for the so-called "heavenly hero"? Not you too. Strike first and we can win. Who dares disturb my beauty sleep? -Here he comes. -He's huge! Back again, little boy? You're a glutton for punishment. Bianca, you find the sword, I'll keep Bjørn busy. Right! We can do this! Swoosh! It's draughty in here. Bianca! Have you found it? Not yet! I'm still looking! Hurry! What are you doing, Luca? I'll never find it at this rate! Give me a break! I'm doing the best I can! Dodge this! Swoosh! You found it! Luca! Let's get out of here! Yes, let's! You hit my pretty face. Eat this! Luca! Alright! Bjørn! The Zenithian sword is mine! Submit or taste its heavenly steel! Huh? Maybe like this? Damn it! The sword... it won't budge. What? So, you're not the hero after all? I don't think so. Today's menu, mixed grill! Uh-oh! -Owie! -Owie! Bjørn is furious. Is that Luca? I'll destroy you all! You can't hide forever! There you are! Kasizzle! -He must have a weakness. -But what? The eye... on his forehead. I know how to beat Bjørn. Really? Take cover over there, Purrcy. I'll need your help too, Gootrude. I've got you now! I hope you like a good barbecue. Actually, I prefer a fresh salad! Swoosh! Are you going to kill me? That's up to you, Bjørn. You can die now or swear loyalty to me. I don't want to die. We did it! Luca! -Thank you! -Our savior! Yeah, our great Zenithian hero. Let's just keep that between you and me, okay? People are going way over the top as it is. -Thank you! -I feel like such a fraud. Look at it this way: you beat Bjørn even though you're not the heavenly hero. That's quite an achievement. Luca! Well, I couldn't have done it without you. You've always had my back, ever since we were little. First at Uptaten Towers, now here. That's nice of you. So, you'll be generous with my cut? How many thousand gold coins did Rodrigo Briscoletti promise you? Actually, the reward for beating Bjørn is Nera's hand in marriage. Nera? That's great. Nera Briscoletti. You'll be the envy of every man in the land. Well... So, that's what this was all about. You can wipe that smug grin off your face. You still have to propose properly, remember? Most girls want their future hubby to pop the question. It's infinitely better than having your parents do it instead. I'm not an idiot. So, why are you here again? Think you can do this alone? Not a chance. But we've been through a lot. It's only right I help you. -Compassion is my strong suit. -Well, I won't be needing it. Anyway, it's time you left. Get going! -Stop mothering me. -Luca! Oh! Hello! I hear you completed the quest. Father is over the moon. Yeah, but it was touch and go. So... well... How should I put it? Let me see... Sorry to interrupt. Ouch. Bianca? What's with you? You're a nervous wreck! The words just won't come out! Ugh! Useless! That hurts! Stop tugging! This wet blanket has something to ask you, Nera. Shut up. Well... um... will you... Will you marry me? Yes, of course! Really? Oh, I'm so happy you asked. I was worried you might not propose, even if you defeated the monster. Will Bianca give us her blessing? I'm sure she will. She was instrumental in defeating Bjørn. She's been nagging after a cut of the reward ever since. She hasn't changed one jot since we were kids. She always says the first thing that comes into her head. Come, eat up. You're family now. Family? Me of all people... married. To Bianca! -Cheers! -How many have I had now? Sounds like some party. Oh, Lord Luca. Everyone! The slayer of Bjørn is here! The heavenly hero himself! Oh, no, I mean... Luca the monster master! Here, get this down you. No, thanks. But we're celebrating your engagement. Look, I've had a busy day is all. Huh? I'll catch you guys tomorrow. Hey! Luca! Are you saying you won't drink with me? Good night, everyone! And, Bianca, try not to drink too much. Wait! Stupid lunkhead. Bottoms up! When did she start drinking like a fish? Can I help you? Hey, hey! What are you doing? Those eyes. Come closer so I can see. Huh? Yes. You're apprehensive about getting married. Eh? Well, I am tying the knot soon, but I'm not worried one bit. She's a wonderful woman. I couldn't be happier right now. Hmm, that's strange. Your eyes tell a different story. They say you're hiding your true feelings. Did you put a spell on yourself? Don't be ridiculous. I'm very tired, so if that's everything... Goodbye. Don't you want to face up to your true feelings? I'll be fine. I only ever follow my heart. Hey! Don't barge your way in! If you're so sure about yourself, then drink this. It's a special potion. Drinking it will reveal your true feelings. If you wish to understand your deepest emotions you should glug it down. If you say so, but there's no way I'm drinking that muck. Goodbye. Just a second. If you won't drink it, you must be in denial. Fine, fine. I'll keep it, but I won't drink it. -You will. -I won't. No, no, no. You'll drink it. What a loony. Argh! It probably won't even do anything. Nera... Nera... Choose Nera. SELF-SUGGESTION Nera... Nera... Choose Nera. Nera... Choose Nera. LUCA'S SUBCONSCIOUS Huh? No, no, no. No way. It's nothing. That old hag was just winding me up. Oh, what have I done? Who said it again, all those years ago? "Your true love is someone you can tell anything to." Am I right? I am right, aren't I? This is bad. Really bad. Huh? What's she doing here? I think I finally know how I feel. What? You want to call off the engagement? Yes. It's a little late for that, don't you think? No one's more surprised than I am... Keep it down. Nera will overhear. I'm sorry for standing Nera up like this. I know what you're saying. You don't care about Nera or the Briscoletti family. That's taking it too far. My feelings for Nera were real. Then why? I just came to understand that my heart belongs to someone else. I couldn't lie to myself. You are rude and ungrateful. The mere sight of you makes me sick. Get out of this town! You should have this back. I'm not the hero after all. Wait a moment. What is it? You're going to search for the hero, aren't you? Yes. Then take it with you. Really? Find the hero and go to the town at the foot of Mount Azimuth. I don't understand. I hear the Zenith Dragon lives there, disguised as a human. You must seek its help. Why me? Do you see that mountain? Dark forces are at work there. It gives me great cause for concern. Oh, and if anyone asks, I'm absolutely furious with you. Got it? You have my word. Now, get out of here, you scoundrel. You are never to see Nera again. Oh, Nera, my poor baby girl. Nera... I'm sorry. What? Have you lost your mind? How could you be so stupid? Only an idiot would jilt a girl like Nera. Well, officially, Rodrigo and I had a big falling out. Look, that's him. Poor guy. Are you saying you didn't? I bet you made it all up because you're so embarrassed. But if what you're saying is true, then congratulations, you are officially the new village idiot! I realized there's someone more important to me. What's that supposed to mean? Don't tell me you fell for some girl who gave you a puff-puff downtown? You've always been... We've always been there for each other when we're in a spot of bother. Hey, where are you going? She's always so bossy, and she never knows when to shut up... but she has the cutest smile. Now, just hang on a minute. You've definitely lost your mind. You're going to regret this! -Don't say... -Bianca Whitaker... Yes! I, Luca Erkel Gotha, would be honored if we could be together forevermore. You said it. You... really said it. You can't take that back, you know? Because I... I feel the same way, too. Oh, that's... Hey! I see you've come to your senses. You've got a lot to answer for. I could have married a kind, graceful woman, inherited the Briscoletti fortune, but it's all gone down the drain. Such things mean little if you have to lie to yourself to get them. You'll never be happy that way. Still, you saw right through me just by looking into my eyes. Even I didn't know how I felt. Never underestimate a woman's intuition, boy. My sincerest apologies. Thanks for your wise words and the special potion. I'll be off then. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone so far? But I couldn't help noticing... your true feelings. Thank you, Grandmaster Nimzo. Now, let's see... It would appear that I still need more power, which I shall obtain, regardless of what may befall my mortal frame. And when the time comes, you shall be of great help, Mada. It's me, your daddy! Young Alus' eyes are the same color as yours, Your Majesty. Yes, but his are much brighter. They're mesmerizing. It's been doing that a lot lately. Perhaps it's telling me to hurry up and find the Zenithian hero. I've probably put it off too long as it is. You're setting off so soon? Yeah. For Alus' sake... I can't let this world fall to the darkness. I know. Huh? Look at you, Master Luca. You're all grown up. Well... Intruders! This way. They're down there! Luca! Head for Roundbeck. And keep Alus safe! Of course, Lady Bianca! I'll only lop off one of your legs, just as Bishop Ladja ordered. Luca! Bianca! Get away from him! Stay out of this, wretch! Kasnooze! Bianca! You're done for! -Oops. -What did you do? I messed up. Words fail me. Well, this is less than ideal. Oh? This girl. My, my... Bianca! I was starting to think you'd never come. Ladja... I came here to offer you the chance to see Mada... but I found myself a nice surprise instead. What do you want with her, Ladja? I want her to open the gates to Nadiria as Mada is showing no sign of waking. But only Zenithians can open the gates. Oh, dear. He doesn't know, does he? All the same, please accept my heartfelt thanks... for giving me such a splendid gift. Do not resist! I know. I have the perfect present just for you. Ka...swoosh! Stunning. Such an exquisite expression. You can watch from there. Watch as the world is plunged into darkness. I still can't quite believe my luck. To think there was another descended from Zenithian stock and she was wedded to the son of Mada no less. Me? That's absurd. My eyes are the wrong color for a Zenithian! Are you sure? Take a closer look at your face. I have good reason to believe that you were adopted. To keep your little secret safe, your birth parents cast a spell to change the color of your eyes. -Now, come with me. -Let me go! -That's... -Mada. She's been rather uncooperative, as you can see from that barrier. I... Legend has it that the Zenithians can communicate using their minds. Have her teach you the spell that opens the gates. Then, you can do for me what she will not. That's... the gateway to Nadiria. Grant me my wish and you have my word that I will set you free. Mada. Who is it that would speak to me? My name is Bianca. I am Luca's wife. Ah, so my son has wed. Bianca, you must not lend a ear to Ladja, no matter what he tells you. He is steadily growing in power, but the gates will not open unless a Zenithian casts the spell. Please, save yourself... and forgive me for being of little help. Mada! Come now. Show me the power of the Zenithians. Kafrizzle! Behave yourself now, Mrs. Gotha. It would be wise to obey me. Never! How unfortunate. Kasizzle! -You underestimate me. -Kafrizzle! Kafrizzle! Cease this. You are but an insect to me. Give up! Ladja! Let me... help you up. One of my poorest pieces to date. Careful. Go slower. Finally, we've fou... Quick, pull me up! Hurry! Zoom! We did it! We finally did it! I don't know who you are, but thank you. How can you say that? I'm... That swordsmanship. Surely you're not... I thought you'd recognize your own son a little quicker. It's me, Alus. But when did you get so... -Behind you! -Huh? Alus, use this! Thanks, Dad! Wait, that sword's... Alus, stop! That's the Zenithian... Whoa! That was amazing! Dad, where did you get this sword? It's brilliant! The Zenithian sword... He was... He was right here. The heavenly hero. It was you this whole time. Lord Luca! Sancho! Master Alus! I'm so glad you are both safe and sound. Truly, this is the happiest day of my life. There's no need to cry, Sancho. Hang on, did you always look so old? Well, it's been eight years since you were turned to stone. Eight years? It's really been that long? They've grown in number. Let me look. Whoa! There are too many to count! So, Grandma and Mom are somewhere on those islands? Right, but getting up there will be anything but easy. Hopefully, we can find the Zenith Dragon. I'll be right there. Honestly... -Um... -Ah. You're... That's right. I remember you! The smelly lad! I've always said it pays to help people, though I never dreamt you'd bring me the Zenithian hero. Dr. Agon, Ladja has my mother and wife held captive, so you and I are both after the same thing. Yes, I too wish to put an end to these darkest of times. I've heard the Zenith Dragon lives in this town disguised as a human. Know anything? Is that a trick question? Um... Eh? Really? Dearie me. I never would have guessed that Dr. Agon was the Zenith Dragon. Would you? I want to help, I do... Please! But I can't. What? I lost the dragon orb. I can't transform without it. What? Are you joking? How could you misplace something so important? Where did you lose it? Now that I'll never forget. It was here, Uptaten Towers. There? That's right by Roundbeck. Wait, do you mean... this? This is a piece of the dragon orb. I found it at Uptaten Towers as a boy, but Ladja destroyed it. Ah, hold on. This is a fake. Really? What does that mean for us? We're out of options. Okay. Time to ask the faeries. Faeries? They live in a cave found deep in the mountains near Battenberg. It's said they can grant any wish. But meeting them is far from easy. They're protected by robots, you see. Robots? Isn't that a bit random? Don't ask me, friend. That's just how things are this time round. This time round? And to make matters worse, the faeries acknowledge only those who overcome a set of trials with their own strength. Gootrude. You followed me. Here they come. How are we meant to get over there? There has to be a way. Think! Gootrude... I could kiss you. If anyone can pull this off, it's us! Ouch. Huh? What? What now? Are you a faerie? No need to stand. My apologies for putting you through such an ordeal. I shall not punish you for bringing the slime. The mere fact you made it here proves that you are righteous of heart. Allow me to grant you your wish. Please, seal the gates to Nadiria forever and save my mother and wife. I cannot. However, I will help you in your endeavors, but I cannot intervene directly. Then what should I... You seek this orb, correct? The dragon orb! Why do you have it? This is a fake. Allow me to send you back in time. Go and find your younger self. I think you know when and where. Say, that's a great orb you've got. May I have a look? Wait, that was... Precisely. You know what must be done. You must return to the past. So that's what happened. Purrcy? Where are you? Hey, you there. Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. I'm a bit lost. Okay. Oh? Say, that's a great orb you've got. May I have a look? Huh? How'd you know? I can smell it from your bag. Oh, yeah? Sorry, but it's too important to show you. Whealbrook is that way. Bye. Hey, wait! I'm not trying to steal it, honest. Tell you what. I'll introduce you to my friend if you'll show me your orb. You do know that makes you sound even more suspicious? Is that so? You might change your tune after meeting my friend. Gootrude the Slime! It's just a slime? I've got a sabrecub friend, you know? He's called Purrcy. A sabrecub at your age? That's impressive. Not really. I just helped him out and we became friends. Oh, and by the way, think really hard before you get married. Your true love is someone you can tell anything to. Okay, got it. Wow, you're a good listener. Well, you don't seem like a bad person, so I'll let you see the orb. Look at that! -Oops. -Hey! Be careful! Sorry about that. Thanks. You're really lucky to have a nice orb like that. Luca, we're leaving soon. Coming! I should go. What's wrong? Is that your dad? Yeah, he's really strong. You must really love him. I've got to go. Okay, thanks for showing me your treasure. No problem. Purrcy! -Hey. -What? What would you do if life was about to get tough? I might be little, but I'm still Pankraz's son. Nothing scares me. Right. You're absolutely right! Bye! Wise beyond his years. Hold on tight. Wow. There she is! Bianca! Luca! Mom! You're... Are you Alus? That's me! You've grown so much. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. Mommy! We've missed the cutest years of his life. There's plenty of time to make up for it. Bianca, what happened to your eyes? It turns out I also have Zenithian blood. You do? Well, that explains a lot! Your mother is up there. Luca... Luca, this is your mother. Huh? -Mom? -Oh. Luca, you should not have come. I wanted to save you, Mom. Your kindness alone is enough. You must forget about Ladja and the gates. Turn back and leave! But... This time round, Nimzo has amassed even greater power than before. He could wipe out the world if he so wished. Do not try to fight him. This time round? Yes, he is nothing like he used to be. We stand no chance against him. The gates will only open if I cast the spell. I am the only one who can keep the world safe. Mom! Zenith Dragon! I am no longer the Ladja of old. Such strength. Don't mind me. Just go! Thank you, Dr. Agon! Ladja! Mom! Mom... Luca... I just wanted to see you one more time. It is the only thing that has kept me going. At least... now the spell that opens the gates... will be forever lost. Mom... Ladja! You'll pay for this! Underlings! Destroy them! Oomph! Swoosh! Kazap! Thwack! Frizzle! Kasizzle! We're outnumbered. This has gone on long enough. What? I've come to repay my debt! Me too! Great timing! Charge! Luca, your mother! Leave the fodder to me! Thanks, Harry. We'll deal with this pest. We've got you now, Luca! Stop, Ladja! All alone, are you? Did you come all the way here just to die? Swoosh! You are not the Zenithian hero. What can you possibly hope to achieve? Kaswoosh! What a pity. You were oh-so close. Alus! This is... far from over. Mom sacrificed herself to seal the gates for all eternity. Your plan is finished... and so are you! I am afraid you have underestimated me! The spell is lost forever! You're out of options! The time is nigh. I gained this power from the light of Nadiria that seeps forth from the gates. Grandmaster Nimzo. The time has finally come to set you free! Her power courses through me! And what magnificent power it is! Opena il Nimzo! And now... my greatest desire... will come to fruition. I'll shut them. If I throw this in, the gates will... But... how will you get up there? All aboard! This ship's about to set sail! Dad! Alus! You did it! Now the world's sa... What's happening? What's going on? What happened? Bianca. Hey, Bianca! Such craftsmanship. They really can make anything these days. What are you talking about? But, ultimately, it's still just a program. Let me show you what this world really looks like. Turn off texture mapping. What are you doing? Turn off gravity. Bianca! Turn off collision detection. Bianca. Bianca! Let's reduce the processor's load. Stop it! No! Leave us alone! Are you Nimzo? Technically speaking, no. I'm a virus that was hidden in the code for Nimzo's character. It would seem that Mada noticed something was a bit fishy. Long ago, a game called Dragon Quest took the world by storm. A few decades later, this state-of-the-art VR technology was perfected. Once commercialized, that same Dragon Quest game was remade for this new platform. And that is where you are now. Drunk on nostalgia, you decided to give the game a shot. Did you know that it's only been a few hours since you started playing? Why are you doing this? Why won't you let us be? The person who created me reviles the scum who call this virtual world home. So, they wrote me and loaded me in. That's it? What kind of motive is that? That's just the way it is. I'm merely the result of a genius programmer's boredom. Oh, right, he gave me a message for you. He says "grow up, loser." Grow up? It's time you returned to the real world. Your memory will be wiped temporarily while you're in here, so you can experience life as the protagonist. I still can't believe I get to go on a real adventure in this world. Didn't you always feel torn between Bianca and Nera? I'm going to choose Nera this time, since I always go for Bianca. This system won't make that choice any easier. You'll be feeling exactly what the protagonist does. I'll just have to convince myself! Choose Nera, choose Nera! Ah, you just activated the self-suggestion program. No kidding? That was quick. This system can create new programs in the blink of an eye. Shall I turn it off? No, keep it on. Also, can I fight some robots? Certainly. I'll add that for you right now. Go ahead and give yourself a name. Luca. I've always called my characters that. Right, I'm going to lower the goggles. Can you read the text alright? Yep. Are you happy with these settings? Yes. Then it's time for you to venture forth. Enjoy! Stop resisting! Why do you cling to this world? Neither you... nor your creator would understand. Happy birthday. Dragon Quest V! Sweet! I've never once thought... of the worlds in these games as fake. Even if they're all just programs, the time I spent with them was real. And these journeys, these battles, everyone I met, they'll always be here. They are hollow illusions. No! They're another reality! Shut up and die! Gootrude? Don't listen to him! Stay strong! Who are you? I'm the antivirus program that keeps watch over this world! I've created a vaccine... and I'm entrusting it to you. You must complete your adventure! It's over! The world... it came back. Dad! Hey there. What happened? You all got put to sleep... but Nimzo is no more. I've never faced anyone so powerful. You really did it, Luca? Now we know who the real hero is! Listen up, soldiers! Our battle with Bishop Ladja has ended. We are victorious! Let me know if you ever need me. Until we meet again. Make sure you visit Coburg. We'll be waiting for you! I will! I promise! Now that was an adventure. Dr. Agon! Nicely done, smelly lad! Look, there's Whealbrook! What a view this is! When we reach my hometown, this adventure will come to an end and I'll return to the real world... but you'll always be real to me, all of you. Gootrude... Luca? Is something wrong? Come and join us! Dad! He's always got his head in the clouds. Still, he's funny, though, eh? This adventure will stay with me forever. What are you grinning at? Just glad that I'm not alone, that's all. Huh? Of course you're not alone. You've got us, and we can watch Alus grow up together. Fireworks! I think they're welcoming us home! Come on, Luca, you saved the world. -So stand tall! -Ouch! That hurt. -Wimp. -No, it really hurt. -Then why are you smiling? -I'm not kidding, you could've injured me! This is as real as it gets. I... I was the hero.
