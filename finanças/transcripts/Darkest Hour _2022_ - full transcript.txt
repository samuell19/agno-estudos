[ Dark music ] [ Church audience] [Father Thomas:] We pray to the our god this day. For the blessings you provide. But from ashes to ashes, from dust to dust, so it must be. But keep this woman or king of kings beneath they all mighty wings. Oh, God, the spirit of all our joys. Because of our delights. The glory of our darkest nights and the comfort at times like these. [Crowd:] Amen [ Crowd movement ] [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Squeaky door opens ] What is your confession, my son? There's. No amount of blood, that can.. Satisfy my thirst for more. What do you mean, my son? I gave my life to this despicable country. I did everything that was asked of me. But in the end, it was betrayed. I've sent. A lot of those bastards. Into the abyss. Yet I feel so divine. So powerful. Tell me, Father. Do you know what this makes me? If I may, I hear a man that is deeply troubled and emotionally hurt. But no my son. I don't know what that makes you. Im only a man. What? That's the best you have. This. It's the best you have to offer. You're not God, are you? Sorry, my son, I only take confessions. I'm not God. You are mortal? Yes, my son. I'm only a man, yes. So disappointing. I expected more from you Son um. I'm. [ Knife drawn ] Dethroning you father. Because I. Am God. [ Dark music ] [ Gun loaded ] [ Gun shots ] [ Crowd screaming ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Bodies falling ] [ Women and children crying ] [Tracy:] Before we start. We're off the record, right? [Dr. Jared:] Yeah, shoot. [Tracy:] Do you know how to decode nightmares? And do you think it cares? [Dr. Jared:] I didn't get that far into my studies and to your second question, who are you referring to? Oh. the nameless in the sky. OK, well, personal info is a no-no for me, but if we're off the record, then my answer is I don't believe in him. Science is sufficient enough for me. [Tracy:] I'm sorry, and I know I'm sounding crazy, but I've been having these vivid nightmares and I just feel like something catastrophic is coming. [Dr. Jared:] That's called no sleep. Seriously, though, if I had my way, a punishment would come soon. We've treated earth like shit, excuse my english. I think it's time for a cleansing. [Tracy:] OK. Just so, you know, I'm not crazy. And I better not see this in my file. [Dr. Jared:] No, you're OK. Shall we begin? [Tracy:] Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. [ Clock ticking ] I should have known. All the signs were there. He such a coward. He should've just. He should've just told me. There I go thinking. That there's something wrong with my reproduction system, and all along, he didn't even want a child. Especially with me. I can't be mad. I got something good out of the deal. I was still able to be a mother to someone. I adopted a son. That bastard surely had me fooled. I wouldn't have been so angry. If he had cheated with a woman. This. This. This. This is this this is funny. What's funny, Tracy? I never thought. In a million years, That I would be laying here on this couch. Mama, I wish you can see me now. Why you believe you're exempted from laying on that couch? For one. Black folks don't do therapy. So I thought. You see, we are a resilient and prideful people. No. We don't have white people problems. We shut up. And we talk to a God. Who doesn't answer. Oh, and let's not forget. As you know. I have a. I had. Had a cheating ass husband who has power in the system. He convinced the courts and the judges, and now the only way I get to see my son is through you. And of course, you're going to convince the judge that I'm sane, right? And how does that make you feel angry? What do you think? I'm great. What I do know is that the human heart is wicked above all. You wouldn't know until that person or situation triggers your dark side. Yes, I'm angry. I guess my anger is amusing to you. Yes, it is amusing and more reason that I love my profession. I just want to help. You made a reference about your mother, is there unsolved damage between you and her? What? What about my mother? What does she have to do with the session? You just fishing. No, not at all. For you to mention her suggests that she had an impact on you positive or negative. It was just a question we can move forward if you like. Negative. She's dead now. That woman, that woman was overly religious. [ Sad music ] I blame her for half of this. Why blame her for your mistakes? I mean, after all, you're an adult. Isn't that kind of selfish? Have you heard of cause and effect? No. I'm not selfish. This woman taught me how to be a church girl, but she never, never taught me how to be a woman, my husband, my ex-husband. Ask me to do simple wifely, sexual activities, and some were just a little bit beyond my comfort zone and I couldn't even do that. I should've just done it. I mean, that's why he left right. He said. I'm too holy. I blame her and God for my downfall. And don't even get me started on God. I stay far away from religion. Good, great progress today. Thank you for sharing. Did I give you enough today? Yeah, you did get today. You know, one more thing you should come with myself and a group of others like yourself to a campsite retreat, get away from the hustle. I really think it would do some good. This isn't some sort of cult gathering, is it? Of course not, no. Just think about it, OK? Sure. Yeah, I'll think about it. OK. [ Dark Music ] [Tracy voice:] I know I'm sounding crazy, but I've been having these vivid nightmares and. I just feel like something catastrophic is coming. [Dr. Jared voice:] Why blame her for your mistakes? I mean, after all, your an adult. Isn't that kind of selfish? [Tracy voice:] We shut up. And we talk to a God who doesn't answer. Have you heard of cause and effect? No, no, no. I'm not selfish. Just so, you know, I'm not crazy. [New reporter:] To protect his identity, we are not showing his face. [Criminal:] You know, I truly want to thank the AI Gods. You know, it's like they have really saved a lot of innocent women. You know, and you know, for somebody like me, you know, I'm a predator, you know, you know, sometimes I'm not proud to see that that's just who I am, you know, and with the artificial intelligence, six dolls, it's like they they know us, you know, and, you know, they channel that beast in us. And you know, we understand us, you know, they don't say no, you know, they love us, you know? You know, and you know, that makes us feel accepted. You know, we don't have to go out there and hurt anybody. You know, like, we have choices with these sex robots, you know, they, you know, they come, you know, I can have a boy or, I can have a you know a woman, or sometimes if i want somebody a young girl or something, you know, you know, I have options. So I think we need to embrace artificial intelligence a little bit more, you know, because it's the new way of life, you know, it's the new norm. You know, so I just I thank the AI gods for, you know, given us this opportunity a new way. . You know, so that's. I love love artificial intelligence. I thought my life was crazy.

I was livid right in front of our son, really? [ Music ] And then he had the nerve to threaten me about my therapy. That's ridiculous. Tracy, I'm all for therapy. It has its perks.

And you're looking at your real parent, and don't you ever forget that? Are are you crazy? Why do you have to go to therapy or do we stop going to church? Grandma always made us go to church. No, sweetie, I'm not crazy. You know, when that feeling when you're trying to communicate and it feels like no one is listening or understanding you. Yeah, OK, well, I don't have that problem too. You know, and this is the time for them to express themselves as somebody that listens and understands them. Well, that's an easy fix. You should pray. OK, sweetie. Time for bed. Can I play one game on my switch, then go to bed? No, I let you stay up long enough. Come on. It's bedtime. Love you Kenny. Don't worry, Mommy. He'll make everything new again soon.

Darkness has taken the hearts of humanity. That which was holding this evil back is gone with half the world. I'm better off dead. The few that remain are tortured and killed, the only way to survive is through our own death. Many hide in the mountains living off what's left of the land, clinging on to this myth. The promise that they can still make it. I don't know if I can make it. I cannot survive this hour. [ Woman screams ] [ Angry mob chanting ] Wait. No, my brother. I like this one. What a brave one you are even in front of me. The one that controls your beat of your heart you defy. Hey, boys. I told you there was something special. On the menu tonight. [ Laughter ] Enjoy. You know. You're a lot like me. You want to kill me? We are the same. Killing just is in our blood. Join us. No. I will destroy everything. That belongs to him.

To whom this may concern everything we've known to be good is no more. I know you're wondering about the absent. They say aliens, but I don't buy it. I want to inform you that I'm heading north to a safe zone. Please stay off the main roads, travel through the mountains. That is the only way to survive this hour. Good luck. [Tracy:] You've given life. I buried it. You gave me a reason. I doubted. You trusted me. I failed you. There's nothing left. Why torture us? Why prolong the agony? Why don't you just end it. What else are you trying prove? You've taken everything away from me. Why? Knock, knock Sorry to bother you, hungry? Yeah Something to warm you up. Thank you. It's actually my specialty. You know, I have nightmares, too. Sounded pretty bad last night. Yeah. It was pretty bad? How long have you been here? Oh, I came here after everyone. Well.. after turns out, I wanted to survive.

But I know I'll see them again. What about you? Kenny. His name was Kenny. He was ten. The last thing he said before he disappeared. Was he'll make everything new again? I just believe.

I've been called to help as many people as I can before the end. Look, I. I read once. Those who look to save their lives will lose it. And those who will lose their lives will save it. Sounds like a riddle. You remind me so much of Sharon. Who? Never mind. It's not a riddle, it's a call. It's saying there's there's still time you can still open your heart. There's still a chance. Enough, Sharon. Jane Tracy, my name is Jane. Oh, Sharon, weren't you, didn't she? Look. It won't be easy, but the rewards will be so much greater. There's still hope, Hope? Hope.
