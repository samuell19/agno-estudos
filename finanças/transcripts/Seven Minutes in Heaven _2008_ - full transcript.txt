You have reached Galia and Oren, please leave a message. Hello, Galia, it's Dr. Ben-Tzur, Oren's condition has deteriorated last night. Please come in soon. Exalted and sanctified is God's great name. May His great name be blessed forever and to all eternity. Honored, elevated and lauded God bless the precious soul of the dear Oren, the son of Avraham and Tzipora Torjaman. May he be resurrected. - Let's say Amen. - Amen. Hi Talia. I'm glad that I reached you. How are you? Fine. I'm packing up. I wanted to ask you if we can move your appointment to 17:00? Galia? Yeah, sure, at 17:00, right? - Have a good day. - Bye. Thanks. I'll get out here. Take her out of here. Are you ok? I'm fine. - That's it, I'm fine. - Are you ok? Yes. One second. You got a little on your cheek. Thanks. Try not to throw this up. Shit, my bag. I walked through here. So typical of me. So typical. Forget about it, someone definitely took it. Here. Do you have your wallet? No. Take it. It's fine. Leave me your phone number. I'll pay you back. I'm Boaz. Thank you. You look good, Galia. Soon enough you'll be able to sleep without the suit. Your burns look better. They're starting to heal. Are you afraid? Yes. It will be fine. That's very nice. Thank you. What is it? Strange, but someone sent it to me. Is it yours? I don't know. More accurately, I don't remember. Do you want to know? Yes. - Hello? - Hi Boaz. What's up? - Am I disturbing you? - No, I'm just watching TV. Ok. So how can I pay you back? Galia Ben Harush Oren Torjaman Hey. Hey. What's going on? Sorry, I'm... Come inside. The money, hold on. Thank you. You're moving? Yeah. I have a big car if you need help moving. Ok, I'm going. - Thank you. - Good night. We have all kinds of things here. Sometimes it takes time for people to come, sometimes they send someone. There are those that never come, they forget. Why didn't you send me my wallet? To where? To me. Why just the necklace? We didn't send you anything. People come here for their belongings. - We don't send anything. - What are you saying? Then who sent it to me? Perhaps someone who knows you, someone from the bombing. Galia? So what, you're following me? Yes. What's going on? I don't know. Ok. Do you need a ride? No. Good night. Good night. Thanks. Are you hitting on me? Huh? Do you know what this is? Yes, I do. So it's just a ride, right? You have reached Galia and Oren, please leave a message. Galia, it's Shlomi. I'm having a Purim party. I warned all the neighbors of the noise. You're invited, come. Bye. Personal stories of the dead and the injured Oren. Go fuck yourself, Galia. Yes. One second. Yes. How can I help you? I was in a terrorist attack, and I'm looking for someone that was there. I mean, someone who might remember me. Perhaps a paramedic. Actually anyone that can help me. I understand that all the lists are here. Yes, when did it happen? Purim. A year ago. The one in the mall? On a bus. In the French Hill? In the city. Ah, oy, it was horrible. Yes, horrible. Thank God you walked out of it fine. I would like to help you, but the lists are confidential. It's a principle of ours. You see, we don't hand out the names of our employees. It's a sensitive matter. Once in a while, when there are happy occasions like a wedding, we share such details. You see, some people like to share special events with those that saved them. But that's only with authorization from upper management. Ok. I get it. Look, I'll give you the number of someone who used to work here. Perhaps he can help you. Ronen? Ronen? The door was open. It's ok, we have nothing to hide. Do you want coffee? Sounds good. Thank you. When did you guys break up? A year ago. And since then you haven't emptied the ashtray? Something like that. Were you there that day? I took Oren out. What happened there? We lost him by a few seconds. I was outside, it was difficult to enter the bus. I saw Oren from outside. He looked fine, relatively. Then after a few minutes, there was a second explosion. Another explosion? Not a big one. It's not clear if it was remainders of explosives or a part of the motor that exploded. In any case, it was enough to hurl shrapnel all over the place. It seems Oren must have caught one in the head, knocking him into a coma and eventually killing him. And me? When was I taken out? You were rescued pretty early on. You were pulled out in time. You were lucky. In short, since you phoned, I made some calls. From what I understand, the paramedic you are seeking doesn't work any longer. I don't have a name for you. But if you want, I know someone from the Zaka Organization who volunteered that day. Perhaps he can help you. Galia? Hi. - Did you wait long? - No. You look great, thank God. Thank you. How can I help you? I'm looking for the person who saved me. It was a catastrophe. We brought in aid from outside the city. We even prepared a bag for you. What do you mean, a bag? You were unconscious for about 7 minutes. You were considered clinically dead, but the paramedic wouldn't give up on you. Apparently, you weren't ready. Not ready? They say there are souls that rise but they're not ready, they're not complete. The creator gives these souls a chance to observe the life they'll have if they choose to return. How can life have meaning when a person already knows his future? No. A soul that chooses to return, only when the soul descends into the body, at that single moment, when the soul and body reunite, does the soul realize everything it experienced. Only at that moment, can the soul, perhaps, make a change. Ok. You think it's nonsense? Yes. Maybe you remember how the paramedic looked, the one who helped me? No, I don't remember. I only remember helping him carry you to the ambulance. I can't recall his face. The whole time I looked aside, I was afraid of your gaze. You couldn't tell me over the phone that you don't remember him? Galia... it was important to me to see you. I recommend that you check at the hospital. Perhaps they have your injury form. The paramedic must have signed it. Thank you. - Hi. - How are you? - Do you need a ride? - No. But I need a mover. Hello? Boaz? Galia, breathe. Are you ok? When are you planning on moving? Why? Do you have a big car? You shouldn't smoke. What are you doing? - Can you make it reappear? - It disappeared. So, you're a magician too? Boaz, what do you want? What do you want? My life back. I know the burns are itchy, but you need to control yourself. I'm trying. The skin on your lower back is dry. You need to apply the ointment. What about Sarit? She still helps you? No, I don't want to bother her with it anymore. I received the injury report. And? I didn't even look at it. Are you getting on? No, I have a ride. - Hey. - Hey. - Did you call him? - What? Did you call him? I called, his phone was off. There are a lot of boxes to move. Dad is probably on his way to sleep. You didn't pack the kettle, did you? I don't know, I hardly know him. All I know is that I'm constantly looking for an excuse to call him. It's a sign that he's special. I told you. Hey. I was stuck in traffic and my phone died. Hi, I'm Sarit, the sister. Boaz, I'm the mover. Nice to meet you. Ok, I'm leaving, bye. Thanks. Bye. Boaz, don't ever be late. Ok. I'm not hysterical or something, just don't be late. Ok. I used to be the one that was always late. Half of my fights with Oren were about that. You know, I don't remember much from that day. I try hard to remember that day, but all that I have are fragments of time. But I do remember that I was late for the bus. Generally I take the bus at 8:30. That morning I got on at 8:45. Oren used to take the bus at 9:30, but that morning he got on with me. I remember that we sat near the back exit. Next to us stood a soldier. I remember his face. I remember an elderly woman with many groceries. She had many cartons of milk. Then I remember my face was covered in blood. My mouth was filled with some kind of fluid. I couldn't move my hands. They felt elastic, like gum. They told me that when they pulled me out, I was already half-dead. It seems that someone decided that I didn't deserve to go. 7 minutes he held on to me. 7 minutes. The next thing I remember, is the hospital. I woke up on my stomach. I won't forget my mom's face when I asked what's that smell, like steak. She didn't answer me. She just cried. Nonetheless the doctor said I'm a miracle. My back looks like I burnt it on a barbeque, my boyfriend was on life support and the doctor thinks it's a miracle. Oren wasn't even supposed to be on that bus. He got on because of me. One second. Look what I found. Wow. - Antique. - Antiqua. Oren accused me of smoking it alone. We have a lot of work. Yup. What do you feel like listening to? For Galia ? Boy in the window ponders ? ? He doesn't want to get up, for what? ? ? In the end it will come ? ? It will come to him, he isn't ready ? ? And you're not from here... ? Do you know that once I loved to sing? Oren used to always say I had a man's voice. Are you real? I'm fiction. I'm in your head. I'll disappear when you come off the high. Galia, my sweetheart, I'm making you another disk. You'll probably lose it. Try to hold on to it. Oren. What do you feel like listening to? Galia, it's me. Great. Did you hear me? It's me, I'm the paramedic. I'm the guy you're looking for. Why did you say that? - You think this is a game? - It's not a game. How do you know I'm looking for someone? I don't remember telling you that I'm looking for someone. What, are you snooping through my things? No. Why? Move. Galia. Don't follow me. Galia. I put the leftover spaghetti for you in Tupperware. Thank you. What? Nothing. I was thinking of traveling to Sinai for the weekend. Sinai? With who? Alone. Hey. I remember you. Dracula. It's occupied. Your butterfly is nice. Excuse me? The necklace. I still haven't gotten used to it. It's a present from my boyfriend. Oh. I'm Boaz. Happy Purim! I'm Galia. It wasn't just the day at the market. You've been there the whole time. I wanted to make sure you're ok. I'm ok. You want to help me? Boaz, what happened there? Galia, there are no answers to what you're looking for. How do you know what I'm looking for? You don't understand that you didn't do anything. I simply need you to tell me. Galia, if I tell you that on the same day there was a car accident and the 8:30 bus was delayed by 15 minutes, in any case you would have boarded the bus, does it change anything? Is that really what happened? No. But it doesn't change the fact that you didn't kill Oren. I want to go there. I want to go alone. I put the leftover spaghetti for you in Tupperware. Thank you. What? Nothing. I was thinking of traveling to Sinai for the weekend. Sinai? Yeah. With who? Alone, for three days. How will you get there? I'll borrow Sarit's car. Ok. - It's only for three days. - Fine. It's not so safe there now, there are warnings. It'll be fine. What? Nothing. I thought we were together, that's all. We're together, I just need time to think. About what? About a lot of things. Great, have fun! - Don't be like that. - What do you want? How am I supposed to take your fits all the time? I'm supposed to feel good about it? And why do I feel that this time you'll also run back to me crying? I see where you want to take this. I'm late, we'll talk tonight. - What will change by tonight? - Nothing. You're just angry now. Again with your infantile hesitations. It's this, it's not this, you fantasize about things that don't exist. We've agreed to a life full of deficiency. I never agreed to such a thing. - You just haven't understood it yet. - Perhaps. Maybe I just need some time to think. From the looks of it, you'll need a long time. We'll start with 3 days. Go fuck yourself, Galia. I hope you return calm tonight. Galia, ok, I'm sorry. Now you don't answer me? Why are you following me? I'm not. Tell me that you forgive me. Galia? Galia. Galia. She's not breathing. Give me oxygen. Galia. I'm here. Galia. Galia, breathe. I think I'm on my way to you. - What? - Galia, right? - Right. - I'm Boaz. Oren spoke to me. Boaz, the paramedic. Oren invited me to your place. Oh, ok. I can't come to the wedding, so... he asked me to come by. He said it's important to him. Right, he probably told me, but I forgot. You know, with the wedding and all, I've been completely out of it. - All the preparations... - I can imagine. Come inside. - Hi baby. - Hi. It's good to see you. So what, you came together? By coincidence. We were on the same bus. What's going on? Fine, fine. - It's good to see you guys are ok. - Yeah, we're ok. What would you like to drink? - Tea. - Tea. - Galia? - Me too. So it's you, huh? Yeah, it's me. What, you can't come to the wedding? I'm going away for the weekend. Oh, you probably have thousands like us a day. I told Oren not to bother you, but he insisted. It's ok. I'm happy to be a part of celebrations. I'm just going to Sinai with my girlfriend, it's her birthday. Oh. I love Sinai. So, how are you? Good. And you? Good. I have a strange question. Have we met before? I mean, besides from the bombing? Yes. Dracula? What? It's sort of embarrassing. We met at a Purim party in some bar and I was a bit drunk, idiotic. Really? How did you know? Know what? When I pulled you out of the bus you were out. When you woke up you told me to get Oren. You said the bus was about to explode. Then something exploded on the bus. How did it come to you? How did you know? Afterwards, you whispered something in my ear. What? Probably you were imagining things. People speak nonsense under such circumstances. What did I whisper? "I love you. " You probably thought I was Oren. That's really what I said? After that you said you were sorry. I don't know what for. They say there are souls that rise but they're not ready, they're not complete. They say the creator gives these souls a chance to observe the life they'll have if they choose to return. A soul that chooses to return, only when the soul descends into the body, at that single moment, when the soul and body reunite, can the soul, perhaps, make a change. Thank you. We're waiting for you downstairs. How much time do you need? What? Nothing. Go downstairs. I'm coming soon.
