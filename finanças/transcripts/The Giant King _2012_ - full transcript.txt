War in the epic Ramayana. It is the legendary battle between Rama's trusted soldier, Hanuman and the evil Ravana. This battle has occurred countless times and lead to 10 million versions of the Ramayana. This is the ten million and first version of the Ramayana. Catching him, Catching him, Catching Ravana Catching him, Catching him, Catching Ravana Diiiieee!!! Yeah! You're late again, Mr. Hanuman. Better late than not at all, Sir Ravana Die! Oh, you think you can hurt me, huh?! But, I know what can destroy you! Oh, you THINK you know! Raaam! Ram Ram Ram Ram Rama creates all. Rama destroys ALL. Ram Ram Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaam! Ram Ram Ram Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaam! Don't tell me you're going to sell this scrap metal? What are you going to with this little piece? Labor costs, transport costs, is it really worth it? Try thinking, okay? You shouldn't just take whatever you see. All day today I haven't gotten a single good piece. Just give me one good piece of scrap, just one. Move forward. More muscle, more power. A little more. It's coming up. Stronger than this. A giant, Oh, I don't believe it, a giant! Oh I'm going to be rich!! Hahaha... AH! I'm going to be rich... Back again ladies and gentlemen, KOK! Your scrap metal king, at the same great location!! Sale, sale, big sale. The most complete specimen we've ever had. Whoever is interested, come bargain. If you miss this chance, you'll be sorry. When this one's gone, there is no more. - I want one leg. - One arm please. I got the head. - The arm is mine. - Me, too. How much for the little one? I'm not selling this one. If you can cut the chain, it's yours! Hey somebody come help cut this chain!! Make way for Dr. WATT. They are going to use high voltage. Raam More voltage. If you can't cut the chain, let someone else try. Raaaaam!! Ram!! It's a dumb monster. Catch him. Whoever can get him, you can take whatever part you like. Get him! Who are they after? They're after you. Hey! Why you running around like that? This is crazy! Come on! Pull it. What is this, a parade? Are you the drum major? Smash them. Can you smash them? OK, you mean like this? Not with me. Keep running. Dead end an angry mob Who are you? Okay, there's no way out now, so just be good scrap metal. I don't want to be scrap metal. The wall! That's pretty high. I didn't ask if it was high! - What do you want me to see? - Don't look at it... smash it! Smash it? The wall is behind us! I know. But, if you want to smash it, you have to get some distance. Actually, I'd like to get a little more distance. That's enough. Just smash it! Don't let them get away. Follow them. Pull back We made it! Back it up! Reverse! Rama Rama will destroy us. Rama We'll Destroy Rama. Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama will destroy us. Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Destroy Rama! Rama will destroy us. We'll Destroy Rama. Rama will destroy us. We'll Destroy Rama. Quiet, please. I need to concentrate. But I'm afraid, I just saw all these heads. Turning in and out, and all around. It was really scary. Look, you're a big giant monster. Why would you be afraid of... and more importantly, here's another question. Why did you put this metal chain-in my butt? You mean that's mine? Well, yeah. But it's coming out of your butt, too. Hey, who are you, what's your name, what are you doing here? Tell me right now! WHO AM I? And you, what's your name? You mean me? Well I'm... eh... why, why can't I remember who I am? And I still can't remember... why I have to be stuck to a giant that doesn't know who he is? So Big Green, what's my name? Big Green? Ha. I like it. "Big Green". That really says who I am. OK, I am going to give you a name. Never mind. A guy like you, a name like, "Whitey". Whitey? What? That's so backwoods! But, look at your head. It looks like a white turnip. I don't want that name. Or would you rather "Rama"? Rama. Where did you get that name from? And why does it sound so familiar? It's right here. Where? Here. Where? How are you going to see it? They wrote it right here. Here! No way! Whitey sounds so much more Hi So. "Rama" is too basic. Call me Whitey. So, from now on, we're going to be friends. No! We don't know each other enough. And one more thing. Me and you can never be friends because we're just not meant to be. Hey, why are you standing there? Follow me! Follow you where? To find somewhere to cut this chain! Hey, can you walk a little faster? A little distance please. They'll think we're dating or something. Go! Shoo! Do you know how to spell "e-n-o-u-g-h"? We come from different worlds. But, Fate has brought us here, now. Travel different roads. But, seek the single path, now. Born of different homes, seek a single love out. Disparate hopes & fears. We share a single goal, now... To find out, to find out... Oh, just who we are. Why did you stop? Left or right? Right. Why? I saw smoke over there. It looks like a city. You are smart. We'll go left. Why? There's more smoke on the left. There's a lot of smoke. There must be a place to cut this chain down there. We still can't put the fire out. Make Way! Boss, we can't put the fire out! The oil is leaking out. - Shut the valve. - The valve's broken. - Well, then turn off the main switch! - But, the main switch is IN the fire, sir. - No one is going in THERE. - The switch is in the fire? Well, do whatever you have to shut this engine down. Or this whole city will be blown up. - You wait right here. - OK Ah! I told you to wait back there. The chain pulled me here. That will cut this chain for sure. Count one, two, three, and throw it. One, two, three and throw. I got it. One, two, three! Pull it out! Not that hard. Pull it back a little. You mean pull it or let go? Pull it up, pull it up... Do you know the meaning of the word "enough"? Can you find something to stop this? It's stopped. The engine is stopped. We're not gonna blow up after all, Somebody got in there and stopped that machine. That guys a hero, a real HERO! Hero, Hero, Hero, Hero, Hero, Hero Thank you for saving our factory. You're heroes! Help me! Someone help me, he stole my purse! How kind. Who did this? Look out, take cover. Oil! Uncle, do you have a blade sharper than this? This is the sharpest blade I have. We've tried every shop, and not one can cut this chain. Let me ask you something. Where'd you two get a chain like this? I don't know. Ever since I can remember we've been connected by this chain. So this chain, it's special? Yes, it is. This chain is made of special material, They use it especially for making war robots. Robots for war? Correct, The legend is this: About a million days ago, At a time when there were only monsters and robots. There was a monster named Ravana who wanted to destroy Rama... so that he could rule the world alone. So a war started. Ravana then was very powerful. The only thing could harm Ravana was Rama's bolt of power. So, Rama sent Hanuman down there to hold Ravana while he shot him, But, Ravana got away! So, Ram had to use the power of his bolt to destroy everything. People say today that Ravana is still alive. He's hiding away somewhere. You know why? To wait for the day he can return. That Ravana guy is really scary. I won't sleep tonight, for sure. Hey, don't believe all this legend stuff. Hey, are you cheating us on the price of cutting this chain? Hey, why would I cheat you on the price of cutting this chain? I already told you that nothing can cut this chain... except for... except for... Come on, let's get out of here. This guy here is crazy. - He'll talk our ears off. Boring! - Except for Ravana's Jakram blade... and that Jakram blade doesn't just cut chains, it cuts everything in this world. Hey let's go. Where did you guys going? Come back here. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Kumbhakarna Show! A new war is about to begin. A Great War. Rama, the evil one will be the cause of war. Don't give up yet. Listen here. Kumbhakarna has a way. I have a way to keep you all safe... from that war... The Kumbhakarna you know is back with good, new stuff To help protect you from the evil powers of the despicable Rama. Hey, where'd it go? Hey Rust, buy me a little time, I have to get something. What do you want me to do? Just sing something to keep them occupied. Anything. Huh? ...Rusty, that's my name, because I am rusted, I work hard every day, to save money for treatment from this condition That's enough, Rusty. We have not hurt Rama. Rama's hurting us. We've been put down. Rama's put us down. To keep us from such harm, We need weapons. We need weapons to defeat him! Guns, sir, guns. The Mokasak mini-bomb gun! Ta... daaaa! 99 baht. Once they're gone, they're gone. I want one please. Sell them, sell them Rusty, help me take care of these people. Achoo! There's no danger. I have rust protector! Here! Keep it and stick it up Rusty's nose. Come on, everybody. Come back please! How could you do this to my customers? Uh... my screw's loose. Achoo! No excuses. Hey, boss, try paying me some of my salary, then I can go get fixed. From what money? Every city it's the same thing, sneezing at the wrong time, at the wrong place! Today I even bought you a brand new flavor motor oil. I don't think you're going to get it. Go away. I'm sick of your face. Where ever you're going just go, GO! Hey... don't forget! Fix those guns right, or we won't have anything else to sell in tomorrow's town. Or else we won't have anything %*(#_%&w@$ me! Blah! If I had 10 faces like Ravana... Ravana Ravana Oh Ravana, if the legend that says your return is true. Please wait for me sir, I will save all I can to build an army and wait for you sir. - Give me that! - But I'm not finished playing yet! I want to play, You got a problem with that? Hoo... but I'm not done playing with it! I want to play first. But, I want to play too! See, now you broke it! You broke it! No, you broke it! - You broke it even more. - But I was still playing with it. You played with it. You fix it. - You have to fix it. - I'm not. - You broke it. So, you have to fix it. - No. Want me to fix it for you? Hey that's that Rusty kid. Will I get rusted too? You'll get it for sure. Then, don't play with her. Let's go play somewhere else. Come on. The kid with the rust. The kid with the rust. The kid with the rust... the kid with the rust. The kid with the rust, the kid with the rust... It's not my toy I want to play, too. Looking for trouble again? You sure you want to play with me? There's nothing wrong with you. You're just a little Rusty. Hey don't harp on that kids problems, ok? You never call a rusty kid Rusty, Because that makes it even rustier. When you think about rust, that makes you rusty. So rust, rust, rust you never say these words to Rusty. Understand? The truth is... the rust you're all afraid of, Well, it's not that easy to catch. You can only get it from my boogers... and one more thing... with metal like yours... achoo! Ew... that's sticky, that's disgusting. Is something gonna happen to me? Aww, now she's crying. Because you were talking about that rust stuff. See? It makes rusty kids cry. Take responsibility. Help me make her feel better? Come on, come on, come on help me out here. Rusty, don't cry. We can be friends. Hey, this is fake crying. But, if I didn't do that, would you still be my friend anyway? Alright, then we're friends. But I'm just a kid and you're a grown up, can we still be friends? Look Rusty, we're not talking about getting married here. People of any age can be friends. And when you're friends, what do you have to do? Uhh, - You have to love each other. - And what else? Well real friends have to... help each other. And friends never abandon each other. So, friends have to have a chain connecting them. Hey, what on earth are talking about? That chain didn't just find my butt. But, this chain is really right for your butt. Hey, you're sneaking looks at my butt. No, it's because you were walking ahead of me. I could see your butt. Will you be having the same? Do you have a drink that helps you remember who you are? I'd like something that soothes my throat. Ah, a hero like you needs something like this, condensed drops of motor oil. A few of these drops will soothe your throat. How is it? Soothes the throat, feels cool, feels like I'm standing in a waterfall. Don't worry about him, His name is Brooks, He's a mountain climber. He climbs and he falls. Oh, mountain climbing? Hey, could I try it? It's not a game, you understand? This is the real one. These may look like children's toys to you. But, professionals use these to climb mountains. Climb mountains? And you. Can you tell me? Have you guys ever had any dreams of your own? Dreams? I don't even have a memory. I dream too, I really do and there's nine broken heads, and they're talking & whispering Every one of us was born with some inherent duty. Take me, I was born with the duty to climb mountains, to climb high, higher, higher, higher, and higher. But my real dream is to climb up to the sun at midday. Brooks, don't you know? Climbing up to the midday sun is impossible. - Of course I know, that's why I want to do it. - That's cool. Why do you want to climb up there? It's hotter than hot. You'll be burned. Because it's my duty, Whatever your duty is, you just do it. No need to ask what for. What for? What crazy duty are you talking about? You mean like the duty to get drunk at the bar every day like that guy? His duty is to get drunk every day like this? There are two types of beings in this world, The first are those who know their duty and do it, The 2nd type are those who do first and later understand what their duty is. Now you, I know you have no memory. You'll just have to keep on doing. And one day you'll realize, just what your duty is. Here, this is the magnet farm. This is where they hang the metal until it's magnetic, and from that they get electricity. Whoa. How about it? Big huh? But the sign says no entry. Right? Come on, let's go inside. I've got a bad feeling about this. You see that dividing line? You dare stand near that dividing line? It looks dangerous. Whimp! Uh, you see? If you don't go pass that line, there's no problem. Still dangerous. I think we better go home. You can't. Once you've come in here, you cannot leave. You must show your courage first. And why do we have to test it? Because you are Rusty. And rusty kids are losers. And do you dare to? I do. In that case, we go together. Whoever gets closer, that's the winner, and the loser must call the winner, "Master". Got it. I think we should go be brave somewhere else. You have to come with us. I don't want to be anyone's master. You sissy. Hey! Are you cheating? I'm closer. I'm closer. I'm closer. I'm closer. I'm closer. I'm closer. - I'm closer. - I'm closer. I'm closer, closer, closer... Get out of there! You don't have to go in there! You can both be my master! Hey, I'm the winner. Call me master, now! Call me Master! C'mon! Hold on tight, don't let me go! I'm not letting go Shut it off! Hey where are you running to? Come back and h... That's the real Brooks. Where ever he goes, he's leaves his name. Hey Green, how about this? Let's play, "order the oil drops". Whoever can order with the fewest words, that guy gets the oil drops. Does that sound fun? One More Oil Drop. Me, too. Mine was shorter. That guy only needed one word. Magnet farm! Stay still my boy! Hold on. Oh no, in ten minutes, my son will be scrap metal. How long has my boy been stuck there? I don't really know, sir. Hey, pull that machine in here. Hurry! Hey Big Green, pull back a little. How about we leave this to the experts, alright? Don't fall asleep, you hear? Because if you do, we're both done. Rusty No, oh no! What do we do next, honey? Get the key! Throw it here! Is my baby is gonna make it? He got it. You're almost there. Almost there. What do we do next? Everyone join hands. Join hands A little more, a little more Give me the key A little closer, a little closer What are you waiting for? Take it. Save our baby I told you, this chain came from your butt Are hurt anywhere son? I'm okay, worry about Rusty, dad, she saved me. Well thank you, little one It feels pretty good to help others What day is this newspaper? Hero of the magnet farm? Hey! Is this a giant? He was born to be a soldier. I have to get him in Tos's army. The weapons I have collected my whole life. It's finally time to use them. Kum, is there a show today? NO, I, uh, I have changed occupations. Too bad. I am going to be a soldier. Hey, can you keep away from me when you walk? There's no chain connecting us anymore. So, why would you walk so close? Because I'm not used to it yet, Whitey. What's there to get used to? No need to feel so attached Big Green, okay!? What did we come here for? To cut this chain, and now the chain is cut. So, now we go our separate ways. Hey! Big Green! Are you listening? Yes, I'm listening. Then look at me, look at me! It just feels weird. It's like there was something there, but, now it's gone. Hello heroes. Could I bother you for a picture please? Sure, sure. A full shot now Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. If dad's not in the picture, How is it a family picture? Then, who's going to take the picture? Everybody smile. One, two... I want a picture with the hero. Let's take a picture. Take one picture with me. I want a picture with the hero Cheese! Ladada... yaya... Nana... So much easier to get around. I was sick of them kids Hero, would you take a picture with grandma please? Hold still, hold still or the picture won't be clear. Okay, grandma, I'll take it for you. Thank you so much young man. I was set to go home, and they tell me to get more steel, We could've done it tomorrow. Yes, this monument uses a lot of steel. Don't talk about the monument. It's a surprise for the heroes. Quitting time! Don't nobody go anywhere-just 5 more minutes. Are you really going to take this chain out? Yes, they're not connected anymore. Okay, Look out below. Alright, that's it for today, Let's get out of here. Hey you're just going to leave this chain here like this? The garbage truck will pick it up in the morning. Go, go, let's all go home. In reality, we're not attached anymore. But for this statue, we must be connected forever. Hey, somebody's been hit by lightning. Hero, are you okay? Hanuman Huh? What'd he say? Hanuman Take Ravana to the execution area. Rama, Rama New location What location? Whaooo... He will destroy Rama. We will destroy him. Destroy, destroy Rama, Rama, Rama Take Ravana there and kill him. Rama creates all. Rama creates all. Knock it off Rama creates all. DESTROY! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy Him! Hanuman awaits your orders. What's going on here? They said some guy got hit by lightning. I don't see anybody got hit by lightning. Hey, go everybody home. The real hero-he's Ravana, Ohh... my Ravana. Three bells and all's well. Hey, Whitey, we're not going to go say goodbye to the Mayor? Don't make it a big deal. Where are we going now? To see Rama. Rama? Do you want to get better? Better from what? To disappear, uh... Oh, cure my amnesia. Haha, that'd be great. Now just follow me. We're going to see Rama, He's going to make us better. You trash can, you Hanuman. He's tricking Big Tos to destroy him. Here comes your big chance to show, Kum. The real show's coming up. How about this? Look at that, the real Mokasak Noon Bomb gun. This time we must use the real one if we're gonna get it right. That little can man thinks he's some kind of hero. What hero boss? What, can man? That can man with the white turnip head. He thinks he's the hero. But Mr. Tos, my Mr. Tos is the real hero. With the power of this gun, Mr. Tos will finally respect me. And he'll take me into his battalion. And I'll blow up Whitey, the can man! My boss is going to shoot Whitey? Oh, no. This battle is not for kids. You stay here... You stay here and watch my truck. Boss, you're not taking your truck? I have transportation better than that. Remember this? The Sadayu 722 fighter plane, vehicle of choice for Sir Ravana. And now my most prized possession. Okay, old girl, let's see if you're worth the auction price we paid. Let's go! That's all you'll wind me up? What do you think, we're just going to the end of the street? Hey Whitey. Can you see that star up there? It's like an emerald green. It's not like any other stars. Whitey, do you think that star has a name? Does it? Yah, it probably has one. Even the stars have names. I wish I could know my real name. Your name's Big Green. Whoa, that's cool. I wanna know... How's Rama gonna bring my memory back? Big guy, maybe you don't really want to know who you are. But the truth is... I already know who I really am. Huh? What did you say? You already know who you are? Yes, sir. I must be... a nursery school teacher. What's wrong, you didn't see them kids? They liked me. Did you ever think you and I could be enemies? That's true-maybe you had a nursery school that competed with mine. If that's the case, then we're business enemies. Green? You remember that guy said everybody has a duty? I remember, that mountain climber guy who call himself Brooks. I envied him. He had a pretty name. So what if, one day... You found out, it was your duty To destroy someone really great. Someone you cared about. What would you do then? ...Green? A guy like this is going to destroy the Earth? Rama, sir. I think you're mistaken about this. You've got a propeller. Why are you flapping your wings, too? Oh you don't like me flapping my wings? OK That's not too bad. Oh, lucky that big letter didn't fall on me. Whitey, need some help? I don't need your help. I told you, I don't need your help. Hey, did you hear what I said? Hey, Whitey, watch out? Hey you, can man, where are you taking Mr. Tos? You know Tos... You're trapped. This electrical net is high volt... Just put up with a little discomfort, sir. Yeah, like this is how it should be. Sir, you have nothing to fear. I'm a sharp shooter. Oh, how could this happen? Hey, when is this going to be finished? It's hot! My complexion is going to be ruined. Hey, how'd you get in there little one? Hey auntie, did you see Whitey and Big Green? Oh, those two... Oh, no. Hey boss! Don't shoot him. That's my friend. Oh, now this is what I'm used to. Don't!! Whitey! That's how it's done! That's how it's done!! Thank you Rusty. Whitey got shot because of me. Go, wind up the plane, will you? Please excuse the temporary inconvenience, sir. Kum... Well, um, I'm your number one fan, Mr. Tos. Whitey, you okay? Don't Big Green, it'll explode! It's a Mokasak noon bomb. Yes! The noon bomb. The bomb is set off by the power of the sun. When the sun hits noon... Sun hits noon? BOOMMM!! Escape with me Mr. Tos. Rusty! Don't be slow, hurry, follow us! Which way to the sun? What do you think you're going to do? I'm going to stop the sun. What are you crazy, Big Green? No one can stop the sun. Rusty... which way to the sun? You see that column there? - Yeah. - That's enough, stop. That way. - Enough, both of you, stop. - It's the noon column. This is not the time to pretend to be a hero. Get Rusty out of here! I just have to stop the sun from hitting noon, and then it won't blow up, right, Rusty? Yah! Hey, get back here, get back here now. Are you crazy? Why would you help me? You don't get it? I'm taking you to be destroyed! Whitey? You mean... you're going to destroy Big Green? Little Rusty. I am Hanuman. Big Green is Ravana. We are enemies. I am on my way to destroy him. Knowing this, do you still want to help me? Get out of here. Get outta here!! Oh, Mr. Tos. - I didn't recognize you with your new paint job. - Can you take me up to the sun, please. You just can't go and leave me behind, the whole area's gonna explode. I'm sorry, but this is really important. Put up with a little inconvenience, okay? Auntie, take me to the sun, please. We're off. And away we go!! You little dope, still haven't run away. Bombs are not toys, you understand? Whitey, did you forget? Friends do not abandon each other. Here it is, sir. The column of the midday sun. In that case, can you take me a little higher? Yah, Okay. If it wasn't for you sir, I would never come this far. I'm not going to make it. I can't do it, sir. If I go higher than this, we'll both break down. Should we go back now sir? Auntie, can you stay still? Huh, what did you say, sir? Mr. Tos! Can you do it? Hold on sir! Sir, wouldn't it be better to turn back sir? No, I have to take care of Whitey. Auntie, you go take care of Rusty! You really won't go Sir? I have to land now. I'm winding down. Rusty, you're not afraid of it exploding? I'm not afraid. Rusty, take it easy. I know you're not afraid. But I'm going to die from you hitting this rock. What's this? What are you doing? That's a noon bomb! We'll all die! Grappling hooks from that mountain climber guy at the bar. My throat's really dry. I wish I had some of those oil drops, now. Oil drops like this I don't need! You mean there's more to get through? What tracks are these? The sun? Oh, the sun runs on these tracks. We did our best now. No need to cry now honey, you'll lose your beauty. Thank you auntie, for being my friend. Actually, I wanted to escape too. I was just afraid I'd have no one to wind me. What's this? Now you're making me rusty. Her name is Rusty, what do you want? You just stay still there. What did you think? I can rust the bomb with my boogers! Rust the bomb with your boogers? Well, alright! Bring those boogers out! Come on, come on, yeah, boogers, boogers, come on. Boogers, yeah, cry, c'mon! Auntie, she's happy, why would she cry now? Rusty, think of something sad, really sad, terrible sad. How about this? You, Rusty, someone like you, really ugly, with that funky head. No one loves you. You have no father, no mother. Don't even think about taking my inheritance. Because, I Sadayu, am taking it all. Hahaha... You should be in tears by now. Like those tragic dramas they show after the nightly news. How about this? Are you ticklish? Here it comes, here it comes! Achoo! Ok, that's the right boogers. But, blow them THAT way. That's it, c'mon, boogers! Come on Achoo! Hey, don't celebrate yet, more boogers, more boogers. Oh, come on, come on, make them wet. Come on, come on, sticky. Achoo! That's good. Excuse me, Mr. Sun, could you stop right there please? Move back. Hey, this is the real deal. Move back. I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. But I must help my friend. Move back... UHHHHAHHH!! Oh... ooooh! So, that's the sun! Rusty, it's almost noon. It's useless. If we don't go now, we won't get out in time. Rusty. That's enough. No way, I have to pull this out. It's rusting now. It's got to come off. Oh, Rusty. Come off! There's no way sir, I can't... let... you... hurt... my friend. Why isn't the hand moving? It's not moving? Big Green really did it. It's out! It's out! Auntie! Am I good? I did it! I pulled it out! Yeah! Well get rid of it. Throw it away! Let's go. What are you waiting for? Let's go!! Mr. Tos, Mr. Tos... My dear Mr. Tos? Mr. Ravana? Who's the fool that threw this noon bomb away? Don't they know what these things are worth? Oh! It's almost noon! Why is it so hot? My wind is nearly done! Are we gonna make it? Big Green! Are you hurt? Wake Up! Come on Big Green, get up! Come on Big Green, get up!! Whitey, is Big Green going to be okay? He's not dead yet okay? He's not dead, right? Come on, you have to help Big Green. Friends don't abandon each other right? Hey! What's this? Whitey! Whitey! What are you doing! Whitey, you let me go right now! Whitey! You're really going to destroy Big Green? He got this way helping you! You mean friends can just kill friends like this? What a mean friend! I hate you Whitey! I hate you Hanuman! Let me out! Let me out right now! You let me out! Auntie, you take Rusty out of here now. What you mean? I'm a bird. Not your local post office. Hanuman Okay, send it is. Special delivery. On it's way.

Since we came on different roads, so it goes we part ways Stop the war, stop the fighting, must stop Ravana Catching him, Catching him, Catching Ravana No matter where you are from you must seek your own destination We come from different roads Hanuman has brought Ravana here as ordered. My duties as a soldier of Rama are fulfilled. From now on, I will fulfill my duties as friend! Shoot right here! And I will help him escape before your bolt can explode. Come on, bring it on! Sir, you can't see? He's not Ravana anymore. He's Big Green. He's never hurt anyone! What do you want?! You say that I have not fulfilled my duties? You sent me here to stop war! I've stopped it here And now, we're all friends! Why should we continue to battle? How many more lifetimes will we fight? Yes sir, it's true, every being has a duty... But now I realize what my true duty is. Come on, don't waste time sir. If you're going to destroy Ravana then do it now, sir. As for me, now I'm going to help my friend. Hanuman... Hanuman... - Big Green - Ravana I am Ravana. Let's go. We have to get out of this place. No I should be destroyed, because I am a monster. No, you are not a monster. I heard you and Rama talking, And you say I'm still not a monster? That's enough Whitey. Whitey... I told you that's enough. Okay, so this is what you want, right? Okay, then we fight, If you lose, you have to escape with me. We really don't have to do this. Ok, now you've lost. Let's go. Let's go. Big Green lost, Big Green lost. Enough with the playing! Hey Whitey, you okay? Is that all you got? Oh, Whitey This is not the time to play. Whitey, just leave me alone. No matter what, I must get you out of here. I won't go. I have to stay here because I am a monster. NO! You're not a monster. You're Big Green. Big Green, can you hear me? Ravana is dead! Ravana! Yeah! It's better late than not at all Hanuman. Well come on, little can man. It's good you've shown your true self, doh... When you fight there's no need for cool philosophy. There's no way out of here. Watch the little man become a crushed can. Before you smash someone... There's no need for cool philosophy. You take it alone in this whole. RAMA Big Green. You really want this, huh? Big Green. - I want to tell you... - Any last words? I never told you... That name, "Whitey" that you gave me because I look like a turnip. I really like that name. Big Green, I know you're in there. You're Crazy! Your brain's been beaten so bad, you can't think straight? No matter what, you have to die! Whitey? Big Green? You're gonna hurt my friend. Ravana, you don't know Big Green well enough! Whitey, now I know what my duty is... My duty is to destroy Ravana! You must get... away!! Ravana, this time I will not let you get away. Ravana must be destroyed by the Jakram blade of Ravana. So, it's YOU that make the monster. Where do you think you're going? Big Green!!! With no Ravana to destroy, Rama's weapons were of no use. That's the way the story goes. It is the greatest sacrifice one can offer-to take of himself, for his friend. And now, are there still monsters out there? There are. Where are they? They are... Here. Huh? - Here... - Huh? And right here. Everyone of us carries a monster inside... Control him, don't let him out, and our world will be happy like you. Can I move now? I'm really tired. Not yet. Hey, Big Green, you're the owner of this nursery school. You know you have to be tough, right? Teacher sir, the school bus is here. That's enough. Thank you teacher. Clear the way, clear the way. Landing! Say thank you, children. Okay, now everybody get in line, no cutting now. There you go. Hey, auntie. No Somersaults this time, OK? - What's up. Did you find one? - Here it is. From now on you'll never have a cold head. Here you go, a remote control car. I fixed it. But, it's still a little funky. - More than just a little - Let me try it out. I'm playing with it, can't you see. Let me play a little, come on. I just wanna... C'mon, let me play a little. C'mon.
