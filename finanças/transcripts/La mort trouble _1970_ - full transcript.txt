UNQUIET DEATH This corset's too tight for me Why wear a corset, with your little girl's figure? You don't even need a bra My God, then they'd see my breasts, how awful We're alone on this island, we can go a bit wild if we like I don't want bare breasts Talking like this is weird, even for us So silky, these stockings, they don't squeal when I rub them Did you manage to shave your legs? While Irene was washing uncle. I hated all that Especially undressing him I had to wash afterwards Does my dress fit? Wait... It's creased under your arm - It's not the time or place for that - Why? This is my first black dress It can't bother him now And it never bothered you before And now it starts... Ladies? Come in When would you like the doctor to come certify the death? After dinner will be fine Alright, you can go now Shall I get a boat to take the body to the mainland? Yes, whatever's best Phone for a special boat to be here tonight Go on! Why are you still here? Go on Hold on, you can help me I need you You can help me fix this dress Here... like this Keep still Clumsy... Always so awkward Pick this up for me - You'll definitely leave the island? - Yes, definitely - You'll leave me here? - No, you'll come with us Thank you Not on that side, on the left It's quite simple We always serve on the left and we serve either on the left or on the right You must stay quiet taking no part in the conversation, don't even smile Don't come so close With bare shoulders that would be very unpleasant And face the other way, I don't like your breath The atmosphere here is suffocating Like we're outside normal life Nothing's normal here, the noise or the climate It seems when people die here, tropical flowers grow from their stomachs, it's so hot I long to get home You'd have to be crazy to holiday here Our uncle spent most of his life here It's absurd, with so much money he could have lived anywhere Now he's dead he'll finally be among his own people - May I please ask a question? - Yes, go ahead When will you leave? We'll leave on the boat along with the body Pack our bags once you've finished here Very good, miss Bring the Benedictine and my cigar Main interjections and phrases... It's not possible, there are rules, we can't live like animals Ah One The main thing is to be careful If we're not careful, we're quickly swallowed up I knew a completely off-center girl, her gaze made your blood run cold Well done Is the boat here? No, miss Crack Is a notary a man like any other? - Orphanage - He looks so vile and flabby, but he has initiative I really don't know Perhaps a cottage in the suburbs of Paris is more fun - Day of God - More peaceful perhaps Just heaven Basically, there's no secret If you manage to plan your thoughts, it's unthinkable to let yourself be overwhelmed Hey! Yes? It would be funny to have a driver Just think, a driver for a very small hire car It would be perfect - So, still no boat in sight? - Not yet, miss Obviously, there's a solution but it would take time - What? - We could do it The villa could be a mortuary I've not seen one round here Zest! - Quick! - This radio's pissing me off! Is the boat not here? Call again and tell them to hurry There's no dial tone, miss What do you mean? I'll show you how to use a phone Hello? Hello?? What's happening? It's all going wrong Very well, we'll wait What is this gibberish? Do you know what it is? Try to translate for me, please I don't understand it, miss Seems something bad's happening on the mainland It seems all communications are down It's all so ridiculous You understand nothing Shut up! Carry on where you were While we wait for the boat to arrive, we'll begin the wake This is my first wake Hello? Get me the port's night service Why is that your business? It's for a boat to get us off this island My uncle just died and we wanted... ...this number's for urgent calls This is urgent, didn't you hear me? My uncle is dead deceased What's that to do with us? - You're sick, my girl - No, I'm not It's me you're talking to How dare you? You rude creature Give me your name, I'll file a complaint Are you there? hello...? So what's the news? I don't know, miss. We should listen to the radio due to the current economic situation, all communications are now suspended across the country Here are a few moments of light music Fine, we'll leave on the motor boat But it's too small We can make a few trips Start moving our luggage now. Get a move on Cretin, can't even tie up a boat You creep! You loser, we're stuck here now No worries. We can sort this - It'll just take a few days - We can't stay here... or we'll have to bury him Why? Don't you see? We can't just leave him After a few days in this heat, he'll start to rot He can't be buried here Our uncle will rest in a real cemetery, on consecrated ground, like everyone else, or he'll not be buried at all It's not possible We can't leave him here That's enough He'll stay until we arrange transport Like I said, this is all temporary Our respect for the dead is perhaps unmatched anywhere In all, we find the concern to honor the poor body deprived of life The cult of the disappeared renders the rules of convenience and etiquette infinitely nuanced, which must be observed in these sad circumstances Although certain conditions of our times have led us to reduce the funeral directors, to soften the rigors of mourning, let us have at heart to keep all of our traditions where we find thus, beautiful family spirit, such a religious respect for the body that the soul has just left A nation like ours, rich in a wonderful past, made up of vibrant and sensitive hearts, can never honor its dead too much Come over here, you It's disgusting, what you did Emmanuelle told me I hope you realize this is truly scandalous Why do you stand there? I'll forgive you this time Don't do it again You can go Hold on I have a job for you Collect all the valuables here and make an inventory I swear, he's twisted Very well, let's do it - Look, the family photographs - Couldn't you sort them? - Shall we stop? - Yes, I'm dead tired Let's go to bed From now on, the three of you will sleep here It needs less cleaning This is unacceptable. You're taking advantage You've crossed the line now It's sequestration A crime punishable by law, you hear me? You'll answer for this Who killed the snoring uncle? That guy's an asshole I'm worried, what'll happen next? See? It's not so bad After all, the house needed something Don't you think? From now on you'll get up at a respectable hour Now come with me, I have work for you "A sweet song that my mom sang to me вЂњSucking my thumb I was listening while falling asleep "This sweet song I want to sing it for you "For you, oh my sweet La la la la la la |a" So, is it all ready?
