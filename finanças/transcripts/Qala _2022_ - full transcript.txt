Lights. Camera. Silence. Action. Excuse me, sir. Could you please let me pass. Didi, here. Please, look at the camera. Many, many congratulations, Didi. Thank you. Congratulations on the Golden Vinyl, Didi. Thank you. Sorry, not you. Um... Hmm. This may take another half hour. That's okay. Let them ask their questions. Okay. Hearty congratulations, Didi. You've accomplished so much already. How does it feel? It feels as if I... reached home tired... and Ma has opened the door. This is my father's legacy. And my mother's dream. She's eagerly waited for this, so she'll be overjoyed today. When are you getting married? Is it true that you are in a relationship with a music composer? Why don't you ask her? My next movie is with Rai Sahab. Naseeban Apa is the music composer, lyricist, Majrooh Sahab, and the heroine is Rai Sahab's co-producer and wife. Next question. Didi, we all know your family has very deep roots in music. Your grandfather was even honored with the great title, Diwan... Sorry, that was my great granddad, Pandit Devram Manjushree. I'm sorry. Your mother, Urmila Devi, was here to launch her son about nine years ago? No. She doesn't have a son. It's just me. Just me. If Diwan Sahab were alive today, he'd have been so happy to see his daughter. Madam, have you thought of a name for the baby? Qala. And my other baby. We didn't want to tell you earlier. Both the babies had the same heartbeat. He died in utero. "He"? It was a boy? Don't worry, she's fine though. Your daughter is strong. Unfortunately, this does tend to happen with twins. That if one baby is stronger than the other, healthier than the other, it sucks the food of the other. So, the weaker child finds it difficult to survive. Doesn't matter if you are a girl. You can grow up to be a musical legend like your father. Talent, training, can be the same as what boys get. But you are a girl, so you'll have to work much harder. You will have to defend your honor a lot more. You understand? Hmm. Well, how can you? But someday you will. Your name should have Pandit before it. And not Bai after it. Only then will you be someone. Can you do it? Can you be someone? Have your tea, Didi. The Illustrated Weekly guys will be here soon. Was that a call from my ma? No. - You sent the telegram, right? - Yes, Didi. You seen today's paper, Ma? There is a photo with the Prime Minister. I won an award, the Golden Vinyl. You wanted it, right? I knew it would make you happy. Uh. Didi, Huma is ready for the photo session. Okay, Ma, I'll talk to you soon. I love you, too. Yes, Ma, I'll taking care of... - Hello. - Yes? I'm calling from Dey Babu's office. It's about Qala Didi's dates... Dey Babu's office is calling for dates. Tell them that if his hero is singing in this movie too, then I should be paid more than he's being paid... even if by just a rupee. Hold it. Beautiful. Enough. - But, Didi, for the magazine... - Hey! I think we've got it. We'll send the pictures for your approval. Thank you. By the way, I loved the one you did for Indira last week. - Oh, thank you. Ta-ta then. - Ta-ta. Okay. Didi, I'll go return Majrooh Sahab's books. Hmm? Chop-chop, we have to go to the studio. Okay, let's see. Thief. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, showing off my dreams on your walls? It's mine. No. There's no fever. What's the problem? Symptoms, etcetera. Um. No. Doctor, there's... there's nothing physically wrong. Just... a noise... ...here. And fear... here. It's... It's... it's like... Uh. I have been waiting for something to happen... and it's happened. Something is breaking inside me. I think you need a break. - She's completely exhausted. - I am not exhausted, doctor. There is something wrong with me. No, it's all right. This is common in females. It's normal. You are a brilliant artist, and artists are more sensitive. They... they take everything to heart. They overthink. That's why this noise... Moreover, you women have certain days of the month, where you, uh... So, what I would suggest is, why don't you take a vacation, huh? - Hmm. - Okay. Then please, send me some sleeping pills. Didn't I send some last month? - There's just two left. - No, no, Qala Ji. Try... try sleeping without the pills, all right? - Why don't you give her warm milk... - No milk! Didi doesn't drink milk. Okay, never mind. Just give her warm water with nutmeg... - You'll just send me the pills, please. - You need to stop thinking. You think too much. You are such a good singer. Just sing. Sorry, Mama. - Let me sing it for you once again. - Put the tanpura down. - Mama, just once more. - Down, I said. Brains are zero. Looks are zero. Zero talent. The least you can do is work hard. Even that is too much to ask? We'll soon be going to Solan. You'll be singing in front of the great Ustad Mansoor Khan. You can't even get your basics right, Qala. Mama, I know it. Just hear me out. Mama just... Mama, I'm... Sorry, Mama. Sorry, Mama. Sorry, Mama. Ustad Ji, Diwan Manjushree's daughter is singing for the first time today. And yet, there's hardly any audience. Because Bapu has come to Shimla, entire villages have gone there. Obviously, they would. Hmm? And this is classical music. Not some flashy film music. Common people would never come. You worry too much. Come. And there is an audience. Pandits, ustads, bards, poets, everyone's here. Hmm? My dear, there is one another singer. Jagan Batwal, from here itself. He'll sing too. But, Ustad Ji, today is Qala's debut performance. - How can someone else... - This boy was brought up in a gurdwara. He's poor, an orphan. Learned his singing there. He is getting a chance to sing in front of you. Hmm? Oh, but if it's about caste... No, no. An artist belongs to no caste. And since it's your wish, I will listen.

Qala, where are you going? Please go and get some milk for Jagan. It's very cold here. Even more than in my Solan. And the snow is worse than in Shimla. I've heard that you sing? The other day I couldn't get a chance to hear you, but Urmila Devi was talking about it. What... What did Ma say? That you sing, and that you'll be accompanying me on the tanpura. What do you want? Who asked you to follow me out into the snow, huh? If you catch the flu... it's not my fault. Scared even before an accusation? Ah. Ah. Qala, what are you doing? - Ah. - He... he had a slight fever. Son, please raise your arm a bit. Careful. There's mercury in there. If a singer swallows, even a bit, he could lose his voice. Sorry, Mama. If you had truly bonded with singing, you would have understood this. What is it? Nothing. Sab khairiyat. Two things. First, if you keep everything locked up inside, buried inside, immersed inside, it could explode. And the second one? The word "khairiyat" is not pronounced with a "kuh" as in "kalakand," but with a "khuh" as in "Khan." "Khuh." Khairiyat. - Khairiyat. - Hello? Got the lyrics? Madam, I got the whole collection for you. Yeah, right. Must've scribbled it on the way here. He can writes a whole song in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. By the way, speed is never a measure of an artist's caliber. So, here's your lyric. - Let's hear it. - Uh. Take a look. - From here, Apa? - Yes, my dear. Sudha, can you ask Mukherjee - to get some snacks? - Sure. - And arrange for some tea as well. - Okay. Greetings. Hey, why don't you hire Gori Sahab secretary? He handles all the stars. You mean I should hire him because he is good at what he does or just because he's not a girl? No, no. That's not the reason. But a female secretary? You can just say secretary, right?

The third stanza is brilliant, Majrooh. But the only problem is, that third stanzas neither get heard, nor played by the radio guys. You could dangle a corpse there and no one would notice. It's a bit choked, Naseeban? It's ends with the word, "Bharam." And there are too many naz, one after the other. It will be tough for you to sing. Rai Sahab, the lyric he has written is conveying exactly what his scene is trying to say. Now we can't argue with a poet and poetry? - Can we? - Didi, Sanyal Sahab passed away. What? THE INTOXICATING VOICE GOES SILENT TODAY: CHANDAN LAL SANYAL PASSES AWAY This is All India Radio. By this time, all our listeners will have read in today's newspapers about the tragic demise of the beloved and popular singer, Chandan Lal Sanyal. And today, seated with us in our studio is Miss Qala Manjushree. - Didi, namaskar. - Namaskar. Well, uh, first of all, we would like to know, have you ever performed or sang along with Sanyal Sahab? I haven't. I haven't had the honor of doing that. You liar. ♪ I have a fondness for breaking apart ♪ ♪ Come gather me ♪ ♪ My love ♪ You know it, right? This lyric? Who doesn't know it?

Not today. Qala. You are just the best at thumri, no one can even come close. Well. Wouldn't you like to come close now? Or would you just like to spend the night talking? From our mountains, especially for you. What does Ma want from Sanyal Sahab? Why was she flirting with him like that? For my sake. She wants me to work in the film industry like Sanyal Sahab does. I'll get the opportunity to work with Sumant Kumar Sahab. I've heard that only the lucky ones get a chance like this. And the Golden Disc, I could even get that. Just imagine. I'll get so many chances to sing. That I'll fill all of Calcutta with my voice. I, too, want the same. I, too, want to accomplish all that. As for the Golden... Golden Award that Ma wants, I'll get it for her. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, Qala, Devendra Narayan did his graduation from a university in England. And he's with the Royal Air Force now, - right? - Yeah. And Rani Mandira was telling me that he, too, is very fond of music. You haven't visited us before, right? Mm-mm. Never. That's okay. 'Cause now, you'll be living there. She's going to love it. And what about your plans? Back to the hills? No. I plan to stay back here. Qala will be with you. And I'll be with Jagan, because his music, his career, everything is here now. - Hmm. - Himachal will have to wait. All right, you guys talk. Uh. Urmila, I'd love to go and have a chat with your young protégé. - Yes, please. Come. - Shall we? - Let's go. - Please come. So, you like music? No. I hate it. The who's who of the industry will be coming. You'll have to meet everyone. Okay, Qala? And of course... Jagan will sing as well. It'll be so nice. May I sing, too? Do you know what kind of girls sing in front of these film industry people? Mm-mm. - But Jagan will be singing. - He is a boy. So, the rules are different. - Can we leave? - What? Can't we go? Just the two of us? We'll go back home. You will get married soon, and go to your home, Qala. But my home is where you are, right? A mother's home is where the son lives. The daughter lives with her husband. Hmm? Okay, I'll get married with Jagan then. Then I can stay here with you, forever. Have you no shame? Huh? How could you even think about marrying your own brother? I can't believe this. I hope you're not putting ideas into his head. Disgusting! Jagan's performance is about to begin. What are you doing here? Go quickly, get some milk for him. How are you? You can actually see me? I thought I was invisible. How could anyone not see you, my dear? You can see me. But have you ever heard me, too? I, too, sing quite well. You're going to regret it. You're going to launch Jagan. Remember, he's very good at replacing people. Jagan could replace me. After a few years, someone will replace Jagan. Like I had replaced someone. Only music will stay forever. All this may sound good as mere words. But when you'll get thrown out because of Jagan, and no one will look at you, listen to you, ask about you or even recognize you because of Jagan. ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ ♪ Leaving the spectacle Of the world a mere fair ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ When my life ends ♪ ♪ Only then Will I stop getting cowed down ♪ ♪ The agents of death Are too strong for me ♪ ♪ How to free this tangle of death ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ ♪ It will take to the skies ♪ ♪ The lonely swan will fly away ♪ Jagan, my son.

When Majrooh heard it. He said, uh, "It's a God-given voice." Thank you. - Like I mention to you on the phone... - I just don't believe it. How could his voice be snatched away like this? God couldn't never make such a huge blunder. You will definitely get your voice back. You will sing again. And your first professional recording will be with us. I'll take your leave then. - Just a minute. - Huh? It's snowing. And it's quite late as well. Uh. Why don't we ask him to stay, Ma? He can leave when the weather improves. How remiss of me.

You're a cuckoo... that never builds a nest of its own. Always grabs the nest of other birds. It never even makes an effort to do so. Has no entitlement over it. Oh, sir, why are you waiting there? Please, come inside. Hello. Um. Is Qala there? Yes. She is. You see, the thing is, uh, I've landed a film after a very long time, so... If Qala sang even one song... I mean... if she could get a date. Even one day will be enough. Yes, yes, sir. I'll get the dates for you right now. Please come inside and have a seat. I'll call Didi. - Thank you. - Please, come. Didi, Sumant Kumar Sahab is here. Just tell him I'm not home. He says he's got a film after a long time and... Didi? Are you okay, Didi? - Didi is not at home. - Hmm. Sorry, I think I misunderstood actually. I don't know when she left. - As soon as she returns, I'll inform... - Thank you. Hello? - Hello. - Hello.
