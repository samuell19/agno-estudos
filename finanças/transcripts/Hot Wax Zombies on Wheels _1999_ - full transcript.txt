(light orchestral music) - And further, Mister Mayor, I move for a no-growth ordinance until we discover just what the desecration of our water off of our coast will have. - Mr. Hutchenreuther, we have the most modern water treatment, the most stringent environmental controls on the offshore waters, as well as the harbor. Surely you know that-- - You have no idea what's going on out there! The new deviation, the monsters even now rallying to take us over. - Oh sir, Daneport. (laughing) - I move we wait and see. Seconded? - Seconded. (gavel banging) - Thank you Bancroft, you may sit down now. Any more business? (rock music) - A business license. - And who might you be? - Yvonne Wayne. I'm renovating the old Augusta house, and opening up a waxing salon. - Now just a second, little lady. You never said anything about wax. She never said anything about wax. Ted's Self-Serve is fully equipped with a full line of-- - Hair removal, Ted. - Hair removal. A salon to remove, I see. Well, Pilar could stand to lose some hair, I guess. - So could you. - I think it's unnatural. Bad for the complexion. Bad for the whole human machine. - Nothing like the wife did up to give the man incentive to come ashore, eh Pepe? (laughing) - Wait a minute. I have some questions. I'm a reporter, Miss Wayne. It's in my instincts. I know a few things. - How lucky for you. - How do we know these people are qualified. Don't you have to have a beautician's license from the state before you can go off opening up some hotsy-totsy wax salon? Just where is that, Miss Wayne? Hmm? - Well, certainly, Mr. Miller. I have all the appropriate paperwork. Would you care to see it? - License, license, license. - License. - License. - License. - License. - License. - Wait a minute. - Majority rules, Karen. Seconded? - Seconded. - Second, sec, call it. - Seconded, meeting adjourned. (all chattering) (light orchestral music) - [Sharon] Captains. - [Obadiah] Yeah? - [Sharon] What was it you were saying about an evil wind? - [Obadiah] The evil wind is one that'll turn you in you any minute and make your hair stand on end. - [Zebediah] It'll shiver your timbers, furl the tops'l and keelhaul the bosun. - [Obadiah] An evil wind will put the mizzen in the fraggin' in as long as it takes to blink. - Oh. That makes sense. Thanks. Um, captains, I know I shouldn't ask this, but what are you whittling? - Yew. - [Sharon] Me. - No, yew. - I? - [Zebediah] Aye. - Oh, yew. Y-E-W, the tree. - Aye, yew. - Oh, I was reading an article about the Pacific yew just the other day, it has all sorts of curative powers like asthma, cancer, you name it. - Aye, and it'll take the barnacles off your stem. - And the woodworm off your stern. Like to smoke it. - I like mine with milk. - Give her a try. - [Obadiah] Never know when you might need it. - Think we confused her with all this nautical talk? - I suppose so. Reckon that's what it's all about, being an old salt. - Old tar, properly it's an old tar. - I know what I am, Zebediah, you old fool. (grunting) (tense synth music) - [Yvonne] I've been expecting you, Mr. Miller. - How did you get this place fixed up so fast? - I know my subcontractors like the back of my brassiere cup. - Like the back of your, your br, hold on. I want to talk to you about your business, because frankly, this kind of establishment is something we in Daneport associate with fruits, and Europeans, and we don't, don't have that sort around here. - Not at all, Mr. Miller. You've got it all wrong. Let me show you. - So, I told Jane, I said, so what if he's 15 years younger than she is. If he makes her happy, that's what counts. - Well, so long as the kid's parents and the police don't find out. So what are you doing this afternoon? - Ooh, I thought I'd try that new salon. Maybe get myself done. Who knows, maybe some 17-year-old stud will get the hots for me. - (laughs) Mom, you and some young thing. Let me know how it goes, okay? - With the salon or the stud? - The salon. You know, I met that Yvonne Wayne the other day. She seemed a little weird. - Oh, weird like Bancroft Hutchenreuter weird, or weird like body snatchers? - Well, just don't let them turn you into a sex maniac or anything, okay? - Oh, and I thought it was the widows like me who were supposed to be the prudes. - I don't know, it just seems a little whacko. - Afraid of the competition, are you? - We don't do legs. - Then what's the beef? - Well, I don't get it. I mean, why bring this kind of business to Daneport? People in big cities and Europe get that kind of treatment. Holy shit. - What? - W-Wayne's D-dip-i-di-di-- - Depilation. - Right. - Yeah. A full page ad? What's gotten into Frank, anyway? He's never taken out a full page ad in his life. - Where is he, anyway? Has anyone seen him? Wayne's Waxing Salon announces its opening giveaway, one free body wax with this ad. Do away with pesky body hair for six months. (sighing) Be more attractive to the opposite sex. Swim faster. Experience love making as it should be. Smooth and hairless. - [Matt] Then what's the beef? - It's good for six months. I mean, if it's good for six months, how can they stay in business? - Wait for the tuna fleet? - Or an outbreak of puberty. Thinking about getting a wax done, Matt? - Me? Never. Car, maybe. (rock music) - [Woman] Oh, oh, this is lovely. (chuckling) (bell tolls) - [Girl] See? Told you it wasn't haunted. - But my Uncle Hernando said it was a place of evil. - [Girl] Well, your Uncle Hernando's been at sea too long. (needle scratching) (woman screams) - I love-- (gasping) - Frank. - The feel of silk on bare skin. - You do? - Got any silk jock socks? - Uh, jock? - Something roomy. - Roomy. Like a studio, or like a mansion? That was a joke. Um. No, no, uh no jock, silk or otherwise, none. I hardly even recognized him. He looked like a wax apple having a bad hair day. - He has undergone rejuvenation at the hot wax palace. - [Sharon] Well, what all did they do to him? - Made him a man. - Really? Ew (laughs). Well, you went there. What was it like? (Mom chuckles) Mom? Mom, are you okay? The salon. What was it like? - Why do you ask? - Oh, come on. A salon in Daneport. A place like that reminds me of a beauty parlor for dogs. You take in a shaggy mutt, you come out with a clipped pooch with a bow on its hip and one on its head smelling like a French whore house. And what all did they do to you? Did they do the whole like body massage and makeup deal? - They get rid of all that pesky body hair. It was the most liberating experience of my life. God, I need a man! - Ain't that the truth. Got tons of stuff that needs to be taken care of around here, and Mick, getting him to help out is next to impossible. (Mom screams) What? - All that hair! Why don't you do something? - I'm shaving it. - That's not enough! (crying) - Mom? Mom! (orchestral music hit) (knife chopping) - Yeah, you're pretty handy with that knife. - Amazing. - It is my profession, you know. Being amazing. - Hey babe. You okay? - Babe. (jazzy music) - Man, that's gotta hurt. - Not if you know what you're doing. (screams) What's the matter? - My mother. She went into that new salon today, and they must have I don't know given her weird pills or something. - It takes women days to adjust to a new do. - Oh, okay, Micky. Well, how does that explain Frank Miller, huh? He's gone weird too. - Let's eat. - All right. (soft rock music) - [Sven] Okay, so one, two, three, four, there. - [Mick] My turn? - [Sven] Yeah, it's your turn. - [Mick] (laughs) Double purple. - You've been getting lucky all night. - I'm just good. (clattering outside) - No Mick, you're over here. - No, I'm right there. - Mick, you're over here. No, you're over here. - All right, you're right. (loud clattering outside) Raccoons? - Who knows. Come on. - You guys. Guys! (door clicking) (sighing) (tense music) (grunting) - [Man] Fore!

Besides, you always love it when I-- - Mmm. - [Yvonne] Watch it. Come. - [Martin] Pesky body hair. - [Yvonne] Watch it. (slapping) - [Martin] Ow. - City Council official business.

(woman screams) Some take the removal better than others. (tense music) - [Sharon] How unusual, it's so warm. - This is where we mix the wax with the other ingredients to remove all traces of pesky body hair. Yes, there is a special chemical to soften the skin and some say it affects the mind. - It does? - It frees you from the distraction of pesky body hair. - It does? - Depilation sets one free from all the unpleasant emotions that we associate with hair. - It does? - The ecstasy of being without pesky body hair is truly orgasmic. - It is. - Beyond your wildest imagination.

(chuckling) So um, get here ASAP, okay? - This is a simple process of osmosis. While the wax is bonding to your pesky body hair, this chemical is seeping into your skin, into your very psyche. - Yeah well, you see, I'm Irish, and I really don't want anything seeping into my psyche. - (laughs) Once you're with us, you'll see.

So you've been hot waxed, haven't you? - It's better than being like you, a slave to emotions and pesky body hair. - So you don't feel any emotions at all? - Only one, lust. Insatiable carnality. Being free of pesky body hair has opened up a whole new world to me. A world of ultimate sensuality. - Since when do you need help getting horny? - It's for the best, Sharon, you'll see. We'll spend the rest of our lives together experiencing the ultimate sensuality. - You, you're repeating yourself. - Oh, it's going to be so good, you being one of us. Now relax. The pain won't last long. And when it's over (magical chiming music) I'll let you be on top. - Golly, I can hardly wait.

I can't let you spread this contagion. - What contagion? - Whatever it is that makes people zombies. Ravenous, hairless horn dog zombies. U.S. swim team? - I went to the nationals as a junior. I did it all. I told you I was thinking of getting back into it. Well, here's my opportunity. I guess I didn't react like they expected. I went to the pool and I practiced. I still have it. And they were right. (screaming) I do swim faster. - But it d-d-d-didn't turn you into a sex-crazed zombie or? - I had no inhibitions to lose. Except those keeping from trying out for the national swim team. And I'm doing that next week. - Help me. I have to stop them. They'll take this formula, and they'll do this again in town after town after town unless they're stopped. - Okay. - I will, I must stop them. - Okay, whatever. - I'll watch for you on Wide World. - [Carrie] Okay, whatever. - Carrie. (sighing) Well, I guess it's just me and yew. (ominous orchestral music) (thunder crashing) - Once we corral Congress, then we'll go after the closet cross-dressers on the radical right. (Sharon grunts) Congressmen are so kinky. Not to mention the President. For say fare (laughs). - Ow, oh. Ow. (grunting) (rock music) Hot damn. It's party time. - Everyone I kiss or has cornered over the internet. Our power will be limitless (laughs). We'll be the gods of ultimate sensualism. Rulers of the world, free at last from that dreaded stubble. Tight-ass Sharon Talbot stands between us and total dominion. Not a problem. - A world without hair. Something has to be done. - [Critter] Faster, faster, faster, get it in, oh, oh! - Fucking rats. - Oh baby, oh baby. Faster, faster, faster, get it in. (moaning) - Is that pesky body hair keeping you from living life to the fullest? If you've answered yes to any of these questions, then I'm here to tell you about something that will revolutionize your life forever. The Wayne WaxOMatic. Just a pinch in those hard to reach areas, and (gasps) you will find that your appointment book will fill up in no time. The Wayne WaxOMatic. Take it from me, a boon to women everywhere. - [Men] And we like it, too. - Mom. You're going cable? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Martin. Come. - [Martin] You calling me dumb? (suspenseful orchestral music) - Come on, stupid child safety. (rock music) - Get her. - (laughs) "Get her". Is that the best you can come up with? (Yvonne stammers) - Seize the frigid interloper. - That's pretty good. Whoa! - This room is a mess. Somebody go get Marion. ♪ Yeah, there you go talkin' all of that smack ♪ ♪ Thinkin' that you're all (door slamming) - Ow, ow! Mom. - Radically cool, isn't it, dear? - I have to know, what is the password? - Orlando? - Damn, almost. Ow. (thunder crashing) (suspenseful orchestral music) Shit. Help! (Yvonne laughs) Help! - Mmm, I love this thing. (Sharon screams) (suspenseful music) (thunder crashing) (Yvonne tsking) - Ah, these things always look better in the catalogs, don't they? Still, it shows a marked lack of self-esteem. (laughs) (electricity crackling) Oh, damn. (sighing) I hope you don't mind waiting while I see to this. Martin will keep you company. This better not be those fucking rats again. (tense music) - Can't you help me? I don't want to wait for them to come back and see me like this, makes me want you now. - Yvonne told me not to. - Mmm. And I want you to do it. - Yvonne won't let me. - But I will. (tender music) (Sharon breaths heavily) Not so fast, lover boy (laughs). I stuff. That's why they call it a booby trap. (spring boings) - Thank you, thank you very much. - This is an outrage! - No, this is an outage. (Yvonne hisses) Ooh, scary lady. (electricity crackling) - How did you do that? - I don't know. Same way I know how to do this. - Oh, what, stop, stop! Stop, you're making me dizzy. - All right, you and Marion, back in the house. (hoe down music) (springs boinging) (groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) Hey, was that you screaming? - Yeah, didn't you hear me? - Barely. I must have wax in my ears. Uh, your blouse and your, uh, accoutrements, it's uh, they're open. Here. - Carrie was right. You are the real guy. (quiet farting) To Gold Rock. - What, now? (grunting) - Okay, that's it. They've had their chance, we're nailing them! My cape. - Oh, I had it cleaned. What with the wax and the road grime and everything. - Let's ride! (adventurous orchestral music) - [Sven] Wow, she said I was the real guy. I wonder if she meant it, though. I mean, you know how women, they just kind of say things. Wait, wait a minute, I mean, I'm real. And I'm a guy, definitely a guy. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Mick's my best friend. And Sharon's his gal. No, I can't do that to Mick, no way. No way, I, yeah I can, yeah I can. Cool. I got a girlfriend. (needle scratches) (rock music) (needle scratches) (adventurous music) - [Sharon] Sven is the real guy. Can I do this to Mick? Yep, I can do that to Mick. - [Sven] Is that an echo? Cool. (singing in foreign language) - [Sharon] Oh my gosh, she's right behind us. - [Sven] A-ooo-ga, a-ooo-ga, down below! (Yvonne yells) - Drive on! Let's get 'em! Whoo! - I think we lost them a few miles back. But why here? (tender music) Okay, enough about geography. But your timing. - Think about it as making up for lost time. (motorcycles approaching) We've got to get to Freeport before Yvonne. (singing in foreign language) (light synth music) - [Officer] Good evening. - Uh, good evening, I'm uh, Sharon Talbot, City Councilwoman from Daneport, and this is Sven Jacobsen, one of our local businessmen. - I'm impressed. - [Sharon] Is, is there a captain on duty? - Got a problem? - Listen, I think we need to talk to the watch captain. - I'm not good enough, is that it, huh? Who do you think you are, rolling in here, trying to get past me to the captain without any explanation? Just trying to pull rank, go over my head, do an end run? Is that it, Miss City Fucking Councilwoman? Big fucking deal. - Hey, may we see the watch captain, please? You don't understand, this is about zombies. - Zombies? - [Sven] Yeah. - [Officer] Zombies. - Yeah. - [Officer] Well yeah, why didn't you guys just say so. - He wouldn't believe it, can you believe it? - Oh, I can believe it. I mean, can you believe it? It's unbelievable. But I believe it. - Hmm. Well, there's one way to make him believe it. Believe me. - What? - [Sharon] Follow me. (beeping) Please, lock all your doors, bolt all your windows. A group of hot wax zombies is coming to town. - Awesome. - And if they find you, you'll be destroyed. So you gotta start gathering yew. You got it? You gotta make your yew turn on them. What am I saying? (motorcycles revving) They're here, they're here! Look out for the zombies! (rock music) - Oh, jeez. All those years of therapy shot to shit. - So. - [Yvonne] So. - It's you. - It's you. - Evidently. - You can't escape, you know. - I won't surrender. - Good, I like a challenge. - You want to take over the world. - I said I like challenges. - I won't let you. - (laughs) You can't stop me. - Maybe not. (laughing) But I can try. I know what you are. You've learned the nearly forgotten secret of formula H-73, the chemical developed during the Spanish-American War to demoralize the enemy by causing increased hair loss, and increased lima bean crop yields. But it had a side effect. It turned people into unfeeling sex crazed zombies. Well, it won't work, because there's more to life than sex and pleasure and smooth skin. There's love and honor and shaving. - You think so? (laughing) Well, we'll see. You might like even sleeping with your stud Mick. I do. - Uh-oh. - You won't any more. (both yelling) (upbeat rock music) ♪ Whoa - [Sharon] Ow. (grunting) ♪ Woke up this morning with an ache in my head ♪ ♪ Got a little crazy ♪ Now I'm feelin' half dead ♪ Drinkin' last night didn't make it go away ♪ ♪ Should have the same if I make it today ♪ ♪ I just can't wait till it makes me numb again ♪ ♪ When I go back and then ♪ She's my only friend ♪ Whoa ♪ Same old me ♪ It's the same old remedy ♪ Whoa - Let her go! - Not yet, I'm almost there. - Let her go, or I'll let you have it! - What? That zombie's dangerous. - All God's creatures have a right to life. - What makes you think I'm God's creature? - Don't quibble. Now you, you zombie. You get out of here. Get out of town. Never come here again. (fingers snapping) - Next time! - Count on it! Whew. Do you know what you've unleashed on the world? The terror, the horror? - We mustn't raise our hands against one another. We must learn to live in peace and harmony. - See what I gotta work with here, man? - Lovely, just lovely. Wait'll they rip your eyebrows off. - They never hurt those that are one with nature. - Uh-huh, okay. - Remember, respect one another. - Yeah. - Whoa. - Peace at last. (thunder crashing) (upbeat rock music) - [Obadiah] Hard about. - Hard about to port, goldang it. (truck crashing) I told you hard about to port. - She don't steer like a ship, you old grunion. - And you don't steer like a captain, you miserable pool of squid ink. - How was I supposed to know she'd pitch and yaw like a derelict, you rum head? (grumbling) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Sven] Sharon look, that's the captains' truck. - [Sharon] It's a total wreck. Look at all that yew. - [Sven] Who, me? - [Sharon] Don't start with me. - (laughs) Oh, that's one load that won't get to that tight-ass Sharon Talbot. (zombies growling) - I will not sleep until these, these-- - Zombies. - Are laid-- - They'd like that. - To rest. Are you with me? - Me? A barber? Need you ask? - You know what this means, don't you? We'll never be able to sleep soundly, never be able to trust anyone. Always on the run, always on the lookout. Never a home or a life of our own. - You mean, we're going to Los Angeles? - It'll be a totally different way of life. - And we can charge it. - All right! (both cheering) (upbeat music) - [Sven] Wow, Beverly Hills. - [Sharon] Land of silicone and liposuction. A perfect hideout for Yvonne. - [Sven] Whoa, that guy just missed me by a hair. - [Sharon] Look out, Sven, these people are hairless and brainless. - [Both] Beverly Hills. - [Sven] Sharon, slow down. Look, that trolley's out of control. - [Sharon] My God. - [Driver] Ahh, no brakes! - God Teddy, your legs are so smooth. Did you get them, you know, done? - Chez Yvonne on Rodeo. Everybody gets done there. It has opened up a whole new world of friction free ecstasy for me, you know. - [Man] Towels, ladies? - Oh, life is finally worth living, without all that pesky body hair. - What's that address again? (water splashing) (elevator music) (rock music) (adventurous orchestral music) (elevator music) - Excuse me, the garden is outside. - We're not here for hedge trimming. (electricity crackling) Ladies and gentlemen, this salon is closed. - [All] Closed? - Do you know the contagion that this waxing process is wreaking on the country? You may not have to shave your legs for six months, sure, but the cost is incalculable. - First time is free. - Your first time is well beyond free. You lose all feeling, all emotion. You become obsessed with satiating your deepest desires at the cost of your fellow man. - And that might be all right for you people here in Beverly Hills, but not for the rest of America. (cannon fires) And on top of all that, you lose your desire to shop. (customers clamoring) (cannon fires) (coughing) Mom, Mom, are you okay? - Stop with the dust, Sharon, jeez. Oh, how could I have been so blind? - Oh Mom. Mom, listen to me. Go home now, leave. If you, if you listen to us, we can help you, set you free. - It was kind of fun dear, but now, stubble. - Just leave this all behind, it's a bad dream, that's all. - It did have its compensations, though. - Mom! - Oh, oh. - [Critter] Oh God, that feels so good. - Rats. - [Critter] Oh baby, oh baby, faster, faster, faster, get it in, oh, oh. (woman screams) Oh baby. Get it in, oh, oh. (light jazz music) - Hey babe. Ooh. - Remember, the real Mick died months ago. - Only his follicles. - Remember the good times we had? - Remember how they ended. - They can come again. You and me and some recreational underwear. It's all possible. - Bet me. (cannon fires) (upbeat music) (Mick screams) Let's bet. - What about Yvonne? - My God, Sharon! You saved me. I mean, til now, I was just a stud, right? How can I thank you? - You putz! I told you not to go to the old Augusta house, and off you go, two-timing me with some artificially maintained motorcycle mama. - I couldn't help it. It's my hormones. (grunting) - How's that for hormones? - You were pretty hard on him. - Zombie or no zombie, wax or no wax, nobody two-times me. - I'll remember that. - Yes, so will I (laughs). So, you've been busy, I see. - Extremism in the battle to rid the world of your infestation is no vice. - Oh, my my my, even you hairy ones can wax poetic. - You ain't seen nothing yet, lady. Ciao, Yvonne. (cannon fires) - Again. (electricity crackles) Again. (electricity crackles) - Running a little short of your precious shavings? Take them. Now what was that, ciao? (laughs) (cannon fires) (bluegrass music) - Dusted them zombies, by cracky. - A-yup, shaving grace. I told you I caught the breath of an evil wind in this town. - If it ain't them zombies, it's barnacles. Ain't no speed rake gonna loosen 'em up when they're that tight on a feller's ass. - Explains why these folks walk so damn funny. - A-yuh. - (laughs) Nice try, Talbot. But as usual, you didn't make it to the climax. (laughs) (upbeat rock music) - [Driver] No brakes! - [Woman] You've been saying that since San Francisco! (trolley crashing) (wheel squeaking) - Feels so strangely unsatisfied. - It's the anti-climax, that's all. - I'll uh, meet you back in Daneport, Sharon? - Perhaps, Mick. Now go on, get going before I wax you a bald spot. How long, how long til people listen to us, til they understand there's no sin in shaving, til they realize the danger? - As long as it takes, I guess, until they realize it's no sin to see a barber. (ambulance siren approaching) - I'm telling you, there's no one under there. There's this cape, and this gooey, waxy stuff. You sure there was a rider on this bike? I mean, maybe the bike was just parked here. I mean, she ain't here now, unless she was made out of wax or something.

Aw, shit. (bluegrass music) (grunting) - [Radio Announcer] That was a hit. I will now play another hit, though I don't know why anybody listens to this mierda. - Where is everybody? Don't they want to get rid of that pesky body hair forever. - Damn it. (blower whirs) Thanks, Sven. (crew laughs) That ought to keep the couches of Beverly Hills shrinks warms for years after this.
