It was a mid-winter trip. Freezing cold, I remember. So we had some hot noodles. And, uh... a chocolate-covered banana? We borrowed this car. All the punks staring at us made me reall nervous. The aquarium. It was closed. The seaside. A seashell. A busted light-bulb. Man, this takes me back! The love hoTell we stayed in. It was her idea, not mine. Um... Oh, that book... Josee was always reading it. 'In a Month, In a Year'... How many years has It been? Hey, 'Brother' .. Sit in for me, Will you? Uh, sure. Boss, can I sit in here? We don't mind. do we? Sorry. I've got the runs. She sure is one weird old lady... Yeah! I see her all the time. About dawn, when I'm going home. This old lady shuffllng along... ...pushing this falllng-apart old baby carriage. It gives me the creeps. What's she got in the baby carriage? A grand-kid, maybe? What are you talking about? She's been doing it for ten years! A mummy, then. A mummy? Her grand-kid, Who died ten years ago. And then she lost her mind. You're crazy. That old lady? She's a messenger. They say she runs stuff for some crime syndicate. Is that true?! That's the rumor. She's carrying something? Yeah? Cash. No, drugs. You're kidding! I should go check her out. Where does she walk? Thanks, man. What? What's going on? 'Earthly Hand' and '13 Orphans'... A perfect hand... The first time I've ever had one. Why when I was just sitting in? Tsuneo! Don't let any stray mutts get near her. Mimi's a virgin, you know. Yeah, yeah...

You've come out of your way. The girl's legs are bad. She can't walk. Cerebral palsy, one doctor said. Then another doctor said it wasn't. We never did find out. But still she wants me to take her out for walk s. For me... ...I don't want people knowing I have a grand-daughter like this. That's why I always go out around this time .. .. so not many people will see her. We Ilve here. Will you eat? Sorry? Breakfast. Uh, well, you know... No, Thanks? It's just that... I'm kind of at work. Thank you. Oh, I couldn't... Thanks. Thank you. Uh... ...this omelette's great. Sure it is. I made it. No thing I make tastes bad.

She would, wouldn't she. So what did you t ell her? I said I thought it was a great idea. Why'd you say that? We I, you know... she's cute. I just had to tell her she was a sweetheart. Out comes the secret weapon. What's that? She looks up at you, tilts her head 45 degrees... ...and say s. 'I'd really like to talk t o you about something.' There isn't a guy I know who could resist that She broke up with her boyfriend. Now she's playing the field. You could fuck her. Yeah? And she's got big tits. What are you grinning about? Nothing. Don't look so happy! Tits, huh... I didn't t ouch the baby carriage. I just went t o look in it and the old woman let go. Causing trouble again! What was in it? I don't know. Now I want to see even more. Sounds like he's after the money. I'd be careful. You might come out worse than you even do at mah jong. Look... ...what are you old farts talking about?!

There's things have to see. Like what? Flowers... And cats. Flowers and cats? Don't laugh! But flowers and cats? Your poor Gran! What the hell?! I got down. You ought to think of a better way to get down. Who's that? Uh, hello... He's back for another meal. Oh. it's you again. I like cucumber. It's not pickled yet. That smells good She keeps diving onto the floor. Diving? It's true! Like it was a mosh pit at a rock show. I'm afraid she'll break her neck one day. You were thinking about social work.. .. so I came t o you. I'm glad you did. Anyway... ...the hand capped should have their homes made barrier free. Handrails, no steps... ...and the bathroom floor raised to level. I don't think They have any money. There's government ass stance. The amount varies from person to person.
