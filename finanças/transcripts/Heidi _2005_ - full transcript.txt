[wind blowing] [peaceful music] [train whistle blows] [bell rings] [indistinct chatter] There you are! MEOWW! Oh no, you don't. What are you doing out in the market place all by yourself? I'm old enough to look after myself too. That's what Aunt Dete says. Anyway. (Aunt Dete) Bridget, have you seen Heidi? [gasps] Shhh. (Woman) She was around earlier. But... (Woman) She's an independent little thing isn't she? (Aunt Dete) Hmmph. You wouldn't say that if you had to look after her. It's cost me a fortune bringing her up. I tell you, the last five years I've had to live like a pauper because of that girl. New hat? Special occasion? Yes.I've been offered a position as a lady's maid up in Frankfurt. Ooh Frankfurt is it? Well I'm sure Heidi will like it there. Heidi! I'm not dragging that millstone with me. Ha. No. I've made other arrangements for her. [gasps] [lively music] Come back! [screeches] [gasps] WHOA! SMACK! [screeches] [Aunt Dete screams] [coughs and sputters] Ugh! HA! AUNT DETE! MY HAT! [gasps] (Aunt Dete) HEIDI!! Home. Now! (Sighs ruefully) My grandfather? Yes, now keep still. We'll miss the train if we don't hurry. And he lives up a mountain? I told you already. With goats? YES! It sounds wonderful! Oh, thank you Aunt Dete! [in disgust] Oh! Come on! [adventurous music] [train wheels clank] What's my Grandfather like? He's... erm... well, I haven't seen him for long time. But he does know we're coming doesn't he? Amm... Not exactly. Is it a surprise! Yes that's it. It's a lovely surprise for him. [train whistle blows] It's beautiful! Much smaller than I remember. And smellier. Turk! Come back here! Dete? Oh, Barbel. How lovely to see you. Oh! You look like a proper lady! (Barbel) Oh, that can't be Heidi! Oh! She was just a baby when you left, and look at her now! Takes after her father more than your sister, don't you think? Oh, he was a handsome man. Poor little thing, losing both parents so young. Yes, yes, yes... well, if you don't mind, we have a long climb ahead of us. [gasps] You're not taking her to her GRANDFATHER Why not? I can't waste my life looking after her. It's the old man's turn. I've had her long enough. [giggles] But you don't know what he's like now. As unpleasant as ever I should imagine. Oh yes! He never comes down from the mountain and if anyone goes near his hut... he chases them away. He won't speak to anyone! You can't leave a child with someone like that! It's none of your business. (boy) Turk, no! Ah! My hat! Heidi! Come back here! [chuckles] Uh, nice to see you again. [Turk's bell ringing] [breathing heavy] Wait for me! [exhales] [struggles] [panting] Heidi! Ohh! [giggles] That's Aunt Dete's favorite hat! (giggles) Turk likes it too. [laughs] I'm Heidi. Peter. [giggles] They're tickly. They're just goats. Come on now shoo. Sorry, I've got to get going. Work, you know. Where are you taking them? To the pasture up there. That's where I'm going. I've come to live with my grandfather. Not the Old Man? Yes. What's wrong with that? Everyone round here is a bit scared of him. Scared of him? Yeah. Apart from me of course. I look after his goat. He's alright when you get to know him. He just doesn't like talking much. Well that doesn't sound so bad. We'd better go. Come on now. Come on. Hmm? Come on TURK! [bleats] TURK, NO! Oof. [chuckles] [panting] My hat! I hate this mountain. [grunts] [Peter whistles] [whistles] Peter, where have you been? I've waited half the day... What's this girl doing here? Hello... You must be my Grandfather. Huh, wha-?! (Aunt Dete) Hellooooo! Ugh... Good morning old man. What are you doing here? I have a job in Frankfurt. I can't take the child with me. I've looked after her since... Well, it's your turn. My turn, is it? I don't want her here! Take her back! Don't want her? She's your flesh and blood. I can't raise a little girl! Look at her. She's the spitting image of her father. I don't want to look at her. You wouldn't want to see her in an orphanage, would you? Your own son's child. I... She's your sister's child too. Yes and I have done my duty by her. Now you do yours. (OS)Goodbye, Heidi! Goodbye... Aunt Dete. I... er... well. I, uh... have to get up to the meadow. See you later, Heidi. Maybe. I... I... Won't be any trouble grandfather. [disgusted] Ah... That's for you. [yawns] Thank you Grandfather. [grumbles] Eh... Mmmmm... that's the best milk I ever tasted! Goat's milk. Best thing for you. Why aren't you eating? [yawns] I'm just not very hungry, Grandfather. That's the best cheese on the mountain! You can't sleep there. Where can I sleep? Up there. Here, take this. Huh? [gasps] It's beautiful... [birds chirping] Good morning Mr. Squirrel. ♪♪ And good morning to you too. ♪♪ Grandfather? I'll get some more wood for the kitchen! [giggles] Hey, careful. [gasps] Oh no! Look what you've made me do! Why, that's a whole morning's milking! I'm Sorry. Clear it up! Now! Yes, Grandfather. I stacked the woodpile again, Grandfather. And I made a pile in the kitchen too. Humph. Can I help with the milking? No, I've seen how helpful you can be. Huh? [laughing] Hey! I wonder what your name is? [mumbles] She's called, "Little swan." Oh. That's a pretty name... ...for a goat... Humph. Hello-o-o-o! (Peter) Hello! I wasn't sure if you'd still be here. Grandfather, if you don't need my help, may I go with Peter? [grumbling] It's all right with me. Come on! Race you to the top! [vibrant music] This is the most wonderful... place in the world! Wait till you hear this! PETER! [echoing] Peter-peter-eter-eter... Can anyone do it? Uh huh. PETER! [echoing] Peter-peter-eter-eter... [chuckles] You're supposed to shout your own name, silly. [giggles] HEIDI! [echoing] Heidi-eidi-eidi-idi. [eagle screeches] That's my eagle. Your eagle? Whenever I see him I imagine he's come just to see me. Watch this. Ha! He caught it! He must be hungry. He's not the only one. Come on. There's someone else who'd like to meet you. So this is Heidi? Thank you, dear. I don't know what I'd do without Peter. Even simple things are difficult for me since I lost my eyesight. I wish I could help my Grandfather. Whatever I do seems to go wrong. Give it time dear. Old folk like me and your Grandfather get stuck in our ways. We don't like change. He just needs to get used to the idea of you being around. I hope it doesn't take too long. It won't. The mountain magic will take care of that. Magic? Oh yes. There is a magic in the mountains that makes everything turn out just the way you want it to. How does it work? You just have to want it with all your heart. Oh I do, I do! [chuckles] Good, well. Anytime you need someone to talk to dear, you're welcome to visit here. It's so nice to hear young voices. Oh thank you, I will. You could come and read to me. I'd like that. I'm sorry, I don't know how to read. Oh, That's all right dear. You come and visit anyway. Just the sound of your voice is enough to cheer an old woman like me. Thank you I will. I'd better go now. I don't want to upset Grandfather again. [majestic music] [goat bleating] Hey that's Little Swan. It sounds like she's in trouble. Oh, not again! [gasps] Oh no! Be careful! Come here, you! Peter, be careful! Don't worry I do this all the time. Shouting at her isn't going to work. Look. Look, look Little Swan. A treat! You're pretty good at making friends. It's easy with animals. [giggles] Grandfathers are bit more tricky. Grandfather! I brought you a present. Keep them away from my cheese. I... Oh... [mumbles] What are you looking at? Achh! Too much salt! (Grandfather) Heidi. Come down and eat. I'm not hungry, thank you. (Grandfather) I insist. I don't want to spoil anything else. (Grandfather) Come down here -- now! Oh, Grandfather! [chuckles] [giggling] Hey! [bird chirps] Granny was right! There is magic in the mountains. ♪ "Up Above the Valley ♪ ♪ High as you can Fly ♪ ♪ There the snow capped sparkle ♪ ♪ So bright against the sky ♪ ♪ The magic in the mountains ♪ ♪ Will sweep your cares away ♪ ♪ I feel it all around us. ♪ ♪ And now it seems to say that everything's okay." ♪ Heidi! Come here. Look. [gasps] Snow! [giggles] [[laughing] Weee! Brrrr. [grunts] A sled! Did you make it? Yeah, a long time ago. It's yours now. Mine! Oh can I go and show it to Peter and his Granny this afternoon. I said I'd visit them today. Not dressed like that you can't. Come on, let's get you inside and get some proper clothes on you. Now, make sure you go straight to Peter's house. I don't want you getting lost in the snow. Here, take this. Off ya go! And don't go too fast! (Heidi) I won't. [cheerful music] Whoosh! Whoosh! [wind] [uneasy music] (Peter's Grandmother) Thank you, dear. Fancy you coming all this way in such terrible weather. I'm glad you did though. Is this from the Old Man? (Peter) He makes the best cheese on the mountain. [wind howls] Wind's getting worse. You'd better stay here tonight. Yes dear. I don't think you should go out in this storm. But Grandfather's expecting me back. I promised. OK then, I'll take you back. I've herded the goats in worse than this. If you're sure Peter. I'll be okay if Peter's with me. [uneasy music] [wind howls] [panting] How much further? We're only halfway! [distant low rumble] Huhh?! Head for the trees! RUN! What? [rumbling] HELP! [shrieks] [rumbling] Heidi! Heidi??? [sputtering] Heidi? [sighs in relief] Whoa! Oh Grandfather. Oh... You're safe now. (Peter) Heidi! Yes. I'm here about the ad in the paper. Pleased to meet you. Please take a seat. I'm worried that my daughter is missing out by not having friends her own age. Oh yes of course Herr Sesemann. I completely understand. I'm sure you'll find my niece the perfect companion for your daughter. Yes, yes indeed. Klara is a delicate girl, I want to make sure I find her a gentle, kind child, some one who can make her laugh, (Aunt Dete) Ugh... (man continues) be her friend. I think she finds life here rather dull and stuffy. Yes, as I said, I understand. Now. The ad mentioned a fee. How much money would we be talking about exactly? [grandfather chuckles] Now keep your eyes closed. And open! OH! She's so sweet! She belongs to you. For my very own? Your very own. But you must learn how to care for her properly. I will. I promise, I will. There's just, er one matter still to be settled. That's, her name. [baaas] Her hair is so soft -- I think I'll call her Silky. You like that, don't you? [grunts] [clears throat] Uh... I think she's hungry. Take Little Swan back to her stall so she can feed her. Hey. [giggles] Stop that! [sinister music] What are you doing here? Don't worry I'm not stopping. I just want the child. Where is she? She belongs here now. What? That's ridiculous! You didn't even want her. Anyway it's all arranged. She's to be the companion for a wealthy little girl in Frankfurt. It's a wonderful opportunity for her. Er, what's in it for you? Nothing! My only concern is Heidi's future! Which isn't going to amount to much if she stays here with you! After all, you didn't give her parents much of a future did you? Er, that wasn't my fault! That's not what they say in the village. I don't care what they say! You built the house. I didn't start the avalanche. The mountain took them. Well that's my point! Heidi's not safe here. Can you protect HER from the mountain? The Sesemann's can provide her with things you never could. Why she might even get some education. That's enough! I'll pack her things while you say your goodbyes. I can't say goodbye. Just take her. [gasps] Aunt Dete! Where's Grandfather? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. You're going to the city with me. But I don't want to go to the city! Grandfather! GRANDFATHER! [struggling] Your Grandfather agrees with me. It's for the best, you'll love Frankfurt. You're going to live in a big house and you'll have a new friend. I've got friends, I've got Peter and Granny and... A goat boy and an old woman! Mr. Sesemann's daughter is a lady. She'll teach you manners. Now COME ON! But Grandfather! I haven't said goodbye. He said he was too busy to say goodbye. Too busy? Oh. All aboard for Frankfurt! [blows whistle] [train chugs] HEIDI! HEIDI! Open the window. I knew they wouldn't let me go without saying goodbye. GRANDFATHER! PETER! Heidi! Here take this. (Peter) So you don't forget us. I'll never forget you! Oh, spare me please. Oh! HEIDI! Auf weidersehen! AUF WIEDERSEHEN! GRANDFATHER! PETER, take care of Silky for me! I will, bye Heidi! Bye, Peter! Bye, bye! [train whistle] [honking] [city sounds] Good morning Madam can I help you? I'm here to see Fraulein Rottenmeir. I have the child. So I see Madam. Stop that and stand up straight! And smile! [coughing] This is the child I promised Herr Sesemann. As you can see she will make a most charming companion for young... erm, his daughter. Klara. That's a nice name. I'm Heidi. Heidi? What a silly name. She's rather young. What books has she read? None. I don't know how to read yet, Aunt Dete said I would learn here. Oof! (Fraulein Rottenmeir) She can't read? That's not what we agreed on. Take her away. Herr Sesemann asked me to find a simple, unsophisticated child, and Heidi fits that description perfectly. (Fraulein Rottenmeir) She is a country bumpkin! What on earth could she and Klara have in common? That's your problem. Herr Sesemann paid me to find him a child and here she is. Good day! Sebastian?! Tinette, take her "things" to her room and find her something decent to wear! Yes Fraulein. Sebastian! Put her in the parlour until dinner. [clock ticking] [bell chimes] [bell rings] [giggling] Weeee! Huh? I'm sorry! I didn't see you there. I'm Heidi. Are you my new friend? I don't have friends. Just people who work for papa. Your chair! It's horrible isn't it? No! It's wonderful. You don't have to sit in it all day. I hate it. Oh. I like your book. You may read it to me if you like. Oh no. I can't read. I don't know how. Ha, you're not going to be a very good "new friend" then, are you? Achem. Dinner is served, Miss Klara. Come on, you do know how to push don't you? [slurps] Has no one taught you the proper way to eat girl? No Fraulien Rottenmeier. I taught myself! [supressing a giggle] [clears throat] That much is obvious! In this house we do not tear our meals apart with a fork. We cut them into small, ladylike mouthfuls with a knife. Like so. A fish knife. This child has no table manners whatsoever. She is a most unsuitable companion. [with mouthful] Sorry Fraulein Rottenmeier. And we don't talk with our mouthful. Especially when we are eating fish. [swallows] Sorry Fraulein Rottenmeier. Why do we not talk with our mouthful when we are eating fish, Klara? Because we may get a fishbone stuck in our throat. Precisely. [coughs] Precise... [cough] Oh my. [cough] Stop that child. Are you alright Fraulein Rottenmeier? Yes I'm fine. Was it a fishbone? No it was not. It was just... [cough] Actually I'm feeling a little faint. Maybe Madam would like me to call Doctor Reboux. That will not be necessary, Sebastian. Although I think I may go and lie down. This child will be the death of me. She has to go. [giggles] (Sebastian) Ahem. I hope dinner was to your liking ladies. Oh yes it was lovely, thank you. Yes I enjoyed it too. I enjoyed it very much. [groaning] [sighs] [magical music] [sounds of the mountains] [sounds diminish] Heidi! Aren't you dressed yet? Hurry up! Klara's waiting. Hmm... There you are. Where have you been? Where could I go to see across the whole city? How would I know? When do I go to the city? Well, what's the tallest building? Oh, the church tower, I suppose. The one with the golden dome. Oh, thank you Klara. [kiss sound] CRASH! HEIDI? HEIDI! Huh?! [horse and cart approach] [horn honks] [rain spatters on roof] Oh... [starts crying] [purring] Hello, where have you two come from? [goat bleats] Have you heard anything from Heidi? Granny's been asking after her again. [deeply sighs] I apologize, Dr Reboux. I had wanted you to inspect Klara's new [sniff] companion. We don't want her infecting Klara with some mountain illness. However, the wretched urchin has disappeared. It can be so difficult to get agreeable staff these days Doctor. But... err... [footsteps] Huh? [panting] TINK! SPLASH! Sorry. [gasps] You've behaved badly! Very badly indeed. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I mean leaving the house without permission! Wandering about without anyone knowing a thing! What do you have to say for yourself? MEOW! Are you making fun of me? No, Fraulein Rottenmeier. [meowing] How dare you? I'm not doing it... They are. [meowing] [Klara laughs] Aghhh! CATS! Sebastian, get rid of those horrible creatures at once. [meowing] SIT DOWN! (Fraulein Rottenmeir) Everything was quiet and orderly in this household until you arrived, young lady. Now it's upside down. [coughing to cover laughter] (Dr Reboux) Water my dear. Hmph. You see what I mean! I do beg your pardon Fraulien. Herr Sesemann shall hear of this. For the meantime, you will stay in your room! For how long? Until I say she can come out! Is that clear? Yes, Fraulein Rottenmeir. [knock at the door] Huh? Shhh! [whispering] Fraulein Rottenmeir has a terrible headache and has decided to take a nap. Follow me. [mimicking] "Everything was quiet and orderly in this household until you arrived, young lady." (Klara) Where did you go this morning? (Heidi) To the church. I climbed all the way to the top of the tower but I couldn't find my mountain anywhere. We're a long way from Switzerland. That's where you're from isn't it? At least I found the kittens. I'm glad you like them. That little rascal! Heidi - do something. Huh? Ugh, ugh, hmm. (Heidi) Oh no you don't. [laughs] What's wrong? It's this chair, I can't even chase a kitten! I hate being stuck in it day after day. Why are you? Dr. Reboux says I have a weak constitution like my mother. She died when I was a baby. So did my mother. I still have my Papa. I love him dearly - when he's home. He writes me wonderful letters but... I wish I could be with him having adventures, instead of being trapped here with Rottenmeier. We can have adventures! Huh?

[coughs] You shout at the person next to you? There's supposed to be an echo. Are you alright? [sighs] How could you leave Klara alone outside with that, that wild creature? Please, allow me... I'm fine, Fraulein Rottenmeier. Go to your room and pack your things. I don't want you in this house another minute! (Klara) NO! As for you, Klara, we will discuss your behaviour later. Take her to the parlour. I said NOOO! I'm sick of the way you keep me prisoner here. I'm sick of the way you've arranged my life... For your own good! Because it's easier for you! Klara! How could you think that? Nothing interesting ever happened until Heidi came. That child is a threat to your health. The sooner she leaves the better. Heidi stays. Or I'll tell my father how upset you've made me. You know how delicate I am. The slightest little thing can set me back... Ah! Hmph. Heidi? What are you doing? Oh! Klara! I was just coming to say goodbye. I'm going home. Oh no, you're staying! Don't worry about Rottenmeir, I've taken care of her. We are going to have so much fun together... You can take me out everyday and... Heidi, what's wrong? I... I want to go Klara. I need to go back to the mountains. But what about me? You can't leave me now. I'll miss you terribly. But I miss Grandfather and Peter and... ...everyone! Go then. Everyone else I love leaves me, why should you be any different. Oh Klara, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry. No I'm sorry. It's just... I was so lonely before you came... Can't you just stay a little while longer? Just until Papa comes to visit next month. I think I could bare it then. I know! In return I can teach you to read and write. Then when I go back I'll be able to read to Peter's Granny. She'll be so happy. I'll stay. That's settled then. Now tell me about all your friends on the mountain. Let's see there's Peter and his Grandma, your Grandfather... ...And Silky and Turk. Turk's a naughty goat. You'd like him. Then there's Silky. She's my goat. Grandfather gave her to me. But... up... the... stairs! [giggles] [devious music] I named the kittens. One's called Red and one's called Blue. Red and Blue [laughing] BANG! BANG! [wind starts to blow heavily] [thunder cracks] Ah! Uh! Ah! Oh Sebastian! What are you doing lurking there? Apologies Fraulien I was just going to close the window. I fear that the latch needs replacing. Or we have intruders! I would think that unlikely in such inclement conditions madam. [screaming] [stairs creak] I... I... It... It.... What is it girl? THE GHOST! Haa! Ghost indeed. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As I said madam, just a loose window. All the same, I think you should check the house from top to bottom. An intruder could easily have climbed in through there. We could have all been murdered in our beds. Oh! KLARA! Ha! Oh it's just you. I heard a scream. Oh that girl Tinette. She thought she saw a ghost. A ghost! There are no such things as ghosts. There is a ghost. Behind you! [gasps] [thunder cracks] Klara! Hmm, very peculiar! I've never seen anything like it! Wait, now I know what it is... It's a smile! [giggles] Oh Papa! And you must be HEIDI. Are you responsible for all this terrible grinning? [laughs] I hear you've been taking Klara out into the town and bringing flea-ridden animals into the house. They're not flea-ridden! I'm sure they're not. Well whatever you two have been up to, it's had a marvellous effect on you Klara. [both chuckle] Now what's all this about... a ghost? It comes in through the upstairs window. Everybody in the house is too afraid to leave their rooms at night. Fraulein Rottenmeir locks herself in. Does she indeed. And have you been visited by this mysterious phantom Heidi? No, Herr Sesemann. And I don't want to be. Well ladies do not fear. Sesemann the ghost hunter is here. With my fearless assistant Dr. Reboux, I will confront the ghoul this very evening and banish it forever! Quite a mystery, eh doctor? But surely you don't think... That the house is actually haunted? No of course not, but something strange is going on. (Dr Reboux) Indeed, but I'm sure it will have a perfectly rational explanation. (Herr Sesemann) Only time will tell doctor. Only time will tell. [snoring] [loud crash] Ha! Dr Reboux. Where? Shhh! Huh! That came from the street! CRASH! It is a ghost. No... It's Heidi! [voice sings] Heidi...

I think what we have here is a simple case of homesickness. Then she must return home to the mountain. Klara won't be happy about that. No... No she won't. But why? I want her to stay here. If Heidi goes I shall... I shall DIE! There, there. Heidi nearly did die tonight. You wouldn't want that would you? No, of course not but... I'll tell you what, Klara. You can visit her anytime you like. Visit her? Really? Yeah. Oh Papa... We have a little present for you, Heidi. No. Wait until you get back your Grandfather. He'll know what to do with it. It's money! Ha! Thank you very much, Herr Sesemann. I thought your Grandfather might be interested in this. It's a book! You've all been so kind to me. I haven't got anything to give you. Oh wait. Here, you'd better have this. So you don't forget me. I'll never forget YOU Heidi. You will come and visit soon won't you Klara? The good Doctor here will accompany Klara to the mountain in the spring. Once the snows have melted. Now come on Heidi. We'd better get going if we're going to catch that train. Goodbye Klara. Goodbye Heidi. And good riddance! Goodbye! Goodbye Heidi, goodbye! [birds chirping] [mumbles] (Heidi) Grandfather! What? Grandfather! Well Heidi. [laughs] Weee. Ha, ha, ha. Woohoo! [sigh of relief] Huh? What's this? Herr SESEMANN said you'd know what to do with it. Hmmph. Is there anything you'd like to buy with it? No, I've got everything I want right here. Ha, Ha, Hmmm. This is for you, Grandfather. From Dr. Reboux and Herr Sesemann. Moun-tain-plants-their-types- and -use-es. They said you would like it. [chuckles] Well, heh. They were right. Thank you. So, er... what would you like to do now? I'd like to go and give Peter a surprise. Oh Grandfather, I'm so happy to be HOME! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. And this time I won't let anyone take you away. [bell rings] Oh, it's you. I'd like to see Herr Sesemann. Herr Sesemann is away on business. Where's my money? I thought this was a respectable household. If you don't pay up, immediately, I will take legal action. Heidi is no longer in employment here. WHAT! Where is she? What about my money? Thankfully, the wretched child has returned to the mountains, where she belongs. And as for the money... Hmmph. Herr Sesemann made her a very generous, some would say over generous, severance payment. Good day. SLAM! Severence payment! We'll see about that! [echoes] Peter... Peter... eter... eter... Huh? Heidi! Peter! [both laugh] Uh oh... Tada! [laughs] Silky, oh Silky! Huh? Come on Heidi, let's go. [wind starts to blow] [sighs] [sighs] [water spattering on ground] (Klara) Heidi! Klara! Dr Reboux! Heidi! Klara! You're here at last. I know I can't quite believe it myself. Come on, I have to show you off to everyone. I can't wait! There. Now who shall I meet first? I know! What about Silky and Turk? It was most kind of you to agree to our visit. We've barely arrived and look at the change that's come over her! (Heidi's Grandfather) Ah, that's the mountain. Maybe you're right. I think young Heidi might have something to do with it too. She's a remarkable child. Now, perhaps you could identify some of these beautiful flowers for me... Are you sure she'll be all right? Don't worry, Peter's nearby. Who's that? Peter! Come down and meet Klara! Hello ladies. Whoooaaaa...! Oof. [gasps] Peter! Peter, are you all right? Ugh, ugh... Right as rain. Ow, ah. [giggles] [laughs] Hello Peter. I'm Klara, Heidi's told me so much about you I feel like I know you already. Shall we go and have lunch? Yeah, come on Klara. [screech] Klara! Watch this! Oh, that's wonderful!. [applauds] I think he likes you! I think he likes lunch! Come on help me set it out. You'll have to move my chair closer. You're so much stronger since you arrived on the mountain. Why don't you try to stand up? I'll help you. Even if you fall down, so what? Ugh. The grass is nice and soft. [laughs] All right. [grunts] [struggles] You did it! [laughs] I did it! You did it! Let's have lunch! [laughing] We'll have you running up and down the mountain like Little Swan before you know it. I think it might take a little longer than that. We've got the whole spring. It's going to be the best time ever. Nothing is going to spoil it. That's right! Nothing is going to spoil it. Uh, um good. Wooo a wo arrgh! Oooohh, Woo, arrgh arrrgh woo, waaagh!! This will do. Stop here. I SAID STO-O-OP! [screams] Aooof, AhAh! Ohoh oooh! I can't believe how strong and healthy Klara looks. It's not just the mountain air. Ha ha. Goat's milk. It's not just the milk either. What's your secret? You already know, Doctor. Simple remedies from nature. It's what the goats eat that makes their milk so good for her. Go on, I'll show you. [devious music] [chuckles] [bleats] Shoo! Shoo! Ugh! CRASH! SLAM! CRASH! [gasps] [gasps] Yes. That'll do I suppose. [gasps] Then again maybe I'm owed a little more. [struggles] Hmmm. OH! My hat! MY MONEY! Yah! Stop that! Shoo! What's gotten into you? Oh no. (Heidi) What's the matter Peter? Have you lost your goats again? That's the third time today!! [giggling] Perhaps we should help him look for them. Peter! We'll look over by the gorge. Nice goat... Pretty goat... [bleats] You'll be dead goat if I get my hands on you. Huh? [bleats] [bleats] [bleats] Something's wrong! Silky! Silky! Oh dear. Oh Poor little goaty-woaty got stuck on the... ...Nasty bridge. Oh, oh. [screams] I hate the countryside. [bleats] [bleats] [screech] Goats? Huh? (Heidi and Klara) SILKY! SILKY! [bleats] [gasps] Silky! [bleats] I have to get her. It's too dangerous! I'll be all right. [wood creaks] Ah, ah. Haa ah. [screams] [wood cracks] OH! Uh... uh... [grunts] [bleats] [gasps] Where did you get that? How did that get there? [gasps] AUNT DETE! Huh? Bravo Heidi. Now bring that envelope back to me. NO! NO! That money belongs to Heidi. I think you'll find it belongs to me. Papa gave Heidi that money. Really. Klara! NO! [gasps] [screams] My money! Heidi! Klara! Phew! Hang on Heidi, I'm coming. What? [struggles] [screams] CRASH! [struggles] Klara! Give me your hand! [grunts] [sighs] Oh, very touching. Now give me my money and I'll go and fetch some help. NO! It's alright Klara. She can have the money. I don't need it. Here take it. [screech] [screams] OH, I HATE this MOUNTAIN! What are you doing? Aghhh! Explain yourself! I was trying to save them! Silly girls. I told them not to cross the bridge but they wouldn't listen to me. That's not true! She wanted Heidi's money. Money? I don't know what the girl's talking about. I think she's a little touched... in the head. Doctor, keep an eye on her. Peter come with me. [grunting] [grunting] [music intensifies] [struggling] [music brightens] She could have killed us both. All she was worried about was the money. I'm afraid the poor things are shocked and confused. All I wanted was my hat, which that silly goat had wandered off with. Ha Ha Ha. There was no money. [screech] Huh? [screech] Whoosh! Ahh.. Here, if the money's all you want, take it. I don't want it. Leave the mountain and don't ever come back! [bleats] [bleats] [gasps] Silky! I forgot all about you. Don't worry I'll get her. My hat! I er... don't suppose you could... Arrgh... [gasps] [laughter] [magical sound] Klara! Look who's here! (Klara) Papa! Klara! You're walking! I can't believe it! How did this happen? It's a long story. It's what Heidi told us all along. There's magic on the mountain. Ha, Ha! There's magic... in you. SMACK!
