Tomorrow is my wedding day, and I'm about to make the biggest mistake of my life, because this man isn't my future husband. This man is my weakness. I know it's wrong, but I can't stop. My desire for this man consumes me. It overrides reason, morals, everything. This is lust. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go back to the beginning, before Trey Taylor shook up my life. Damon King. You want my arm to fall off? - Billy Dee Williams... - Lady Sings The Blues. I know. You need to work on your game, Mr. King. Why are you so much trouble? Because I'm your fiancee. It's my job. Damon, Damon. Can I get a couple of minutes for my viewers? Sasha, of course you can. How you doing? I'm doing good. You excited about the wedding, Tiffanie? I am. Very. - I'm ecstatic. - So when's the big day? That's one week. You know this is my masterpiece. Talking about a masterpiece, King Enterprises is one of the biggest companies on the sea. What would you say to aspiring entrepreneurs? You know, you gotta wake up every day and grind, 24/7. Rumor has it that you're opening a spa. - Oh, yeah, that's right. Yes. - Yes. Urban Utopia's the name. You know, we wanted to create an oasis for the people. You know, the average person that can afford a nice getaway. You come by the office tomorrow, I'll have a letter of intent for you. Look, at the end of the day, publicity alone is gonna garner thousands of streams, Justus. Listen, I know Damon got the game on lock. - Absolutely. - But I'mma be honest with you. I need to meet more people. - Justus. - Make it happen. I'll make it happen. - Hey. - Hey, babe. - Mm. - Thank you. You want some before I put it all up? Oh, totally. You ain't talking about food, are you? Mm-mm. On the counter. Baby, it's unsanitary. Take it out. Hey. You can't talk like that. Can we go upstairs now? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Well, that was so hot. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh. Eric says that we are at the top of the list for Justus' album release party. You know, if we get that, it's gonna take us to the next level. - Right? - Mm-hmm. We're gonna be the king and queen of Atlanta. I must have missed the coronation. What's up with you tonight? It's Urban Utopia. Baby, we're just a few days behind the opening. - Uh, uh... - I got you. I took care of it already. You agreed to be a silent partner. Making decisions about my spa is so not silent. All right, I might not be college-educated, but I think I've opened up a few businesses. And I've had some failures. Tiff, I'm just trying to shield you, that's all. Hot shower's calling my name. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey... We good? King and queen of Atlanta, right? Something was off with me and Damon's sex life. I remember the cheesy romance novels I'd sneak around with. The passion! The orgasms! Why wasn't I experiencing that? Something was missing between us, but I didn't know what. He says the treatment tables are in Idaho. Oh, uh, we open in less than two weeks. That would be a saving grace. Actually, I'm the signer on the account, not Mr. King. Yeah. Oh, is that right? Y-you can just change that back. Under my name, yes. Okay. Thank you, Marjorie. - I mean, and timing is... - I got you. I can go bigger if you want me to. Just say the word, I got you. If you need anything, you just call me. Okay. All right. Oh. Oh. I cannot wait for you to walk down those stairs on our wedding day. How on Earth do you look so chic? I mean, look at me. - You look comfortable. - Child, stop. That's a nice way of saying sloppy. - Pick one? - Uh-uh. This is Damon's taco stand. I was told to just show up on the day. Geometrics, please. Thank you. Let me take care of this. - I'll see you in a second. - All right. Mm... - This wedding keeps expanding. - You're not happy? I always thought I'd get married in my grandfather's church. You know, something small, simple. You should have seen the look on Damon's face when I suggested it, you would have thought I asked the man to marry me in a barn or something. Well, he does love this house, doesn't he? - Mm. - Okay. - It's ostentatious. - Yeah. I mean, how many great rooms does one need? - I'm sorry, I don't... - No! No, no, no. You're my bride. I'm here for it all. - Even the complaints. - Yeah. - Now, how's Urban Utopia? - Oh, it keeps evolving. - Okay, well? - Yes. Well, I want Urban Utopia to be more than a spa. I want women to come, like, even if they just wanna visit the sauna or the quiet room or have some tea and journal. I want it to feel like a sanctuary. - I like that. - Oh. And we hired a hairstylist, 'cause you know what our hair does with the steam. Child, you have single-handedly figured out the problem for every black woman using the spa. I mean, seriously, that's exactly what we need. Always think about everybody else. - Mm. That sounds great. - Babe. Uh, we gotta go. - Phyllis, tall one. - Okay. - All right, we're all good. - You got me, huh? Uh, we're in the final stretch now. You guys ready? - Yes, we are. - All right. Okay. Hi, grandpa. We're ready. - Uh, we finished the exercise. - What did you discover? Well, we discovered that we pretty much problem-solve the same. - Mm-hmm. - We're lists people. We pretty much jot down the areas of concern and compare notes. Well, good luck with that. Grandpa... It takes years for couples to learn how to argue in a healthy manner. How long have y'all been together? A year and a half. Tiffanie, your grandmother and I have been married over 55 years and we're still trying to figure it out. - Well, maybe we're an anomaly. - Maybe. But I'm concerned that you all are being completely honest with each other. Trying to please each other is very temporary. And the truth, as ugly as it can be, is the key to a very successful marriage. You understand? We agree. - Don't we, babe? - Yes. Now, I want you all to read and discuss Ephesians chapter five, verse 25 through 30, okay? Ooh! Sweet! Hm! Boy, nice! Hm. Babe, your shirt's unbuttoned. Oh. Oh, this game... Man, I knew I should've went. I'm here for my interview, Mr. King. Interview? My name is Angela, and I'm here for our interview. But, oh, I, I don't have any experience. Is there anything I can do... Baby, you're so beautiful. But all this kinky stuff, you know, I kinda, I did that stuff in the past life. I wanna leave it there. Now, what we have is, is pure and I love it. I need you to do me a favor, though. I need you to pick up Trey for me. Can't Magic do it? Yeah, he can do it, but you know I have the meeting with Jaleesa and her record label, and he just came home, and I want you to do it for me. - It is Magic's job. - Mm. Trey's leaving right after the wedding, right, baby? I'm sorry, but the man just got out of jail five seconds ago. I know, but he's changed. Give him a chance, okay? What time does he land? You know you're my angel, right? Come on! Damn! I know Shelly doesn't have a ton of experience, but she's a single mom. Mm, you know, she did give me that bomb deep tissue, but she's not coming in with any existing clientele. We're a new business, Tiff. It's risky. We're hiring her. - All right, boss-lady. - What's next? You gotta pick up El Chapo. - Yeah. - You want me to go with you? No. It's not getting any better, Sonia. I warned you, do not give it up before marriage. Are you really saying that if I stayed a virgin until marriage, the sex would have been better? Look, it was for me. So God is punishing me? No, but there are consequences to your actions. But I can't re-virginize myself. - And that is not a word. - It is now. I feel like I should get points for waiting as long as I did. I was practically the 30-year-old virgin when I met Damon. You're right, exactly. I mean, you waited this long, so you could have just waited a couple of years longer, 'cause y'all are getting married, what, after only a year and a half? - Yeah. - In the grand scheme of things... - I was just so ready. - Yeah, to lose 'em draws. Shut up! Okay. How bad is it? It's not, it's not terrible. It's just vanilla yogurt. But you, you look like you like that vanilla yogurt. Hm. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. I was reading online... Yeah, that's the problem right there. Do not ever go to the web to self-diagnose yourself. Uh-uh. Don't do that. Uh... Ah, hm... Oh. Oh. Baby. That is a good man right there. Talk you later. Love you. The story of our lives is just beginning. And I can't wait to fill all of these pages with you. Damnit! Ah... Ah! Just a minute! Uh, can I help you? Um, you're bleeding. I'm Trey. You're Tiffanie, right? Oh. I was supposed to pick you up. I'm sorry. It's all good. I got an earlier flight. - Vanilla yogurt. - Hm. What's wrong with vanilla yogurt? It's boring. You're not gonna cause trouble here, are you? I can go. Trey? I'm sorry. Come in. I realized later that Trey never answered my question. Does it hurt? I can do this. No, you can't be trusted at all. This one here for you. Minute ago you were just trying to kick me to the curb. Now I'm your hero. I wouldn't say all that. Look, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. It's just... Damon has worked really hard changing his image... So you think I'm bad for him? I don't know. Are you? There you go. Let's get you all healed up. - Thank you. - You're good. You're welcome. You ever been inside a cell? Uh-uh. There's no fresh air. There's no trees. Only nature you get is cockroaches. And everything's hard like concrete. Even the people. I haven't seen anything beautiful in seven years. It's like, all this time I've been cravin' things I can't have. And it's, it's just been getting built up. So I got to watch myself. Anybody home? Nice to meet you, Tiffanie. Yeah, somebody home. Oh, my dawg! Ah... Oh, I missed you, man. - I missed you. - A lot. A lot of nice things here, man. - I missed you, man. - I missed you, too, brother. - Look at all this, man. - Let me show you something. Yeah, you got this. Yeah. Half-back option pass. The bottom line is... You've always been a better defensive player than offense. Stop deflecting. You had everybody in the class believin' that you were the principal's nephew. And even had the teachers believing it. Oh! That sounds like Damon. Out of control. He'd been out of control since then. Hey, D, remember our first deal? - Don't you tell that stor... - Oh, bro, they jacked us... Hey, hey, hey, hey! We don't talk about... I don't talk about that. Especially in front of my lady. Okay. My bad. So, Tiffanie, how'd he bag a dime piece like you? I worked at King Enterprise. That's how we met. That's right, the first day she was in the boardroom trying to run things. My pitch made your company money. You still work there, Tiff? No, she's about to open up her own joint... Hey, my man, let your woman talk. I'm excited, but all I can see right now are problems. Baby, I told you, I can help you with that, it's okay. I got you. You can't just write a check for everything, Damon. So, D, how's your mom and pops, bro? They're happy that I'm finally getting married. Tiffanie, your parents excited, too? Well, her grandparents raised her. This tea, right here, dawg, this tea is crazy, man. You... - Can I get some more of this? - Of course. Baby, ba... Relax. I'll go get it. I'll get the tea. - What happened to your finger? - I cut it earlier. - Oh. - Baby, it's okay. Uh, hey. Do not believe a word that this man is telling you. - I got you. - Man... This guy right here, man. I lost my parents, too. My mom was in a car accident when I was a kid. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you. You know, Damon, he was raised by the Huxtables, you know what I'm saying? At least when the Huxtables meant somethin'. Messed my boy, I love him to death, but... he don't know real pain. Damon has a good heart. Next to my grandfather, he's the best man I know. No doubt. If you ever need to talk... What'd I miss? Here you go, bro. Oh, thank you, brother, appreciate that. - I have to go. - Babe, wait. Where you going? Chef Louise is about to hook up some steaks. - Trey, you hungry? - I can eat. I can always eat. Yeah, I've got to meet grandmother at the, uh, the bridal shop. I'll be back. Uh-uh. - I'll text you. - Okay. Bye, Tiffanie. Mm-hmm. Mm. Ain't got to make love to it, man. Man, you just don't know. Make sure you save some room 'cause Chef Louise is gonna bring out that double-chocolate pudding. I'm telling you now, it's nuts. Look, bro, I appreciate you hooking up this trip. Man, my room, my room is something like Obama was staying in. You know what I'm sayin'? It is crazy, bro! I tell you, that's, uh, Tiff's and I's favorite spot. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's gonna be there the night before our wedding. What can I say? My girl's traditional. How traditional? You know, I, I appreciate all this, man. Yeah. Trey... I got you, man. You sure about that? I know we got some unfinished business. But let's take care of it after the wedding, okay? Fair enough. Hey, grams. - Hey, bride. - Oh. I'm so happy you're here. Oh. I'm so happy, too. Oh. We will see you at your final fitting in just a few days. And here's that other order. Would you like me to get you some tea? - Uh, yeah. Tea would be nice. - Mm. Uh, Tiffanie, what's happening? For you. It's... It's beautiful! Oh! Oh. I hope you and Damon didn't spend a fortune on this. Come on. Nothing is too good for my grams. Love blue, love sparkles. What's the matter? Okay, come on. Let's go sit down. I was clearly desperate. Talking to my saintly grandmother about what was going on in my head... But that's how rattled I was after meeting Trey. So what's going on? I'm going to tell you. But you're not allowed to smack me, grandma. I'm grown now. I can always smack you. I'm not a virgin. Did you think I didn't know that? Well, Damon is the only man I've been with. - Well, thank God for that. - Yeah. And I don't have anything to compare him to, so this, this is purely a gut feeling... but I think our sex life might be lacking. Oh. Well, before we go down the Viagra route... No! Uh-uh! No. That's not the problem. I thought... I can't talk to you about this. Well, maybe I can help. Was there ever a time that you wanted to experience another man? I married your grandfather when I was just a girl. And I wouldn't change that. But, yes, there were some times when... I became interested in other men. And that was challenging. Was there a someone that you ever felt a, like, a real connection with? "Walk in the Spirit," and you will not give way "to the desires of the flesh." Our marriage vows are not just for our husband... they're for God. And whenever I was tempted, I reminded myself of that. Is there someone that you are craving for? No. No, grandma. Do you love Damon? Hm? Yes. Do you feel it in there? Mm-hmm. Then it's real. Mm. God made this union, baby. He wants you and Damon to be together. But you watch out. You watch out for the devil because he will be on the hunt. So you watch out for him. You hear? Was Trey the devil? Was he sent as some kind of test? I don't know, but I intended to avoid him at all costs. Let me hire more people, I'll get you up and ready by opening day. Were you supposed to be in this meeting? Well, hello to you, too. Warner, can you do me a favor and brief Tiffanie? Yeah, sorry to make you recap, Warner. No problem. The patio can't be salvaged. And we're blowing circuits all over the place, so I suggest we rewire the whole place. - Ah... - Mm. How much? Uh... We are hemorrhaging money at this point. Let me take care of the tab. I, I can do the rewiring. Yeah, I mean, just buy the supplies. I won't charge for labor. I can set up each room on its own GFI outlet, um, that way, like, let's say a circuit blows in this room, th... We could keep the spa running. Yeah. Exactly. Well, hell, if you won't hire him, I will. Man knows his stuff. So what's it gonna be? We need a beat to discuss. Uh, that's fine, but if you wanna be ready and open, I need to know ASAP. Okay. Can you guys just give us a moment? - Please? - Sure. - Why didn't you wait for me? - Time is money, Tiff. And you were late. We had to start the meeting. I don't want you to use Trey, okay? - Why? - 'Cause I wanna offer him a job. I need to see where his head is at first. - I'll hire someone else. - Mm-hmm. You just work out your stuff with Trey. Do you know how much I love you? Mm-hmm. Okay. Go, go, go. Go. I've gotta get to work. So if the role play don't work, we're gonna bring out the big guns. Don't fret, baby, we're gonna change that funky sex life around. You see these pills right here? It's gonna get you just right. Trey! So if the role play don't work, we're gonna change that funky sex life around. You see these pills? Uh, that was, I was, uh, researching. Uh, so what are you doing here? I've been thinking about you. Tiffanie, you need me. You need me to... you need me to do your rewiring. Oh. Mm-hm. Right. Rewiring. - What's all this? - Oh, these are essential oils. We use them for treatments. Yeah. That's eucalyptus. It's very therapeutic and, uh... They actually, they smell way better on the body. - You got some on? - Mm-hmm. My, uh, my wrist. Mm. - You got something else on? - Lavender. - Ah, yeah. - Yeah, it's calming. Mm-hmm. Man, that's nice, that's nice. Well, look, I'm not leaving until you say yes. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. Yeah, can we just, uh, keep this between us? Until I tell Damon, that is. - Oh. It's cool. - Okay. Let's do another one, um... How about this one right here. This looks like rose. - That's rose. Mm-hmm. - That's rose? Um... That's nice. That's real nice. I should have said no to Trey. But my common sense had been hijacked. I was in the throes of lust. Must've been some night. What do you mean? You slept in your clothes. Here. I'm so tired, babe. You know, everybody wants to be a entrepreneur. They all want the glory, but they don't wanna put in the work. But you, you been grindin' since day one and... I'm so proud. Thank you, Damon. You know, I was up late last night, too. I just kept replaying that look on your face when, uh, you walked in to the meeting. You were hurt. And I was the cause of that. And I don't ever wanna hurt you, Tiff. It wasn't intentional. No. I could do better. I'm gonna take a step back, you hear me? And if you want my help, you're gonna have to ask for it from here on out. Deal. So what's the plan today? My surprise bridal shower is today. Wait. You already know about it? Sonia knows I wanna look good. Well... Mm-mm! I haven't brushed my teeth yet, baby. - You think I care? - Oh, you should. All right. Mm! - Lavender. - Mm-hmm. Hey Sonia, something came up, I'll just be a few minutes late. okay? What up, Tiff? Hey, I came by to talk about the light fixtures. You didn't have to come all the way down here for that. They're pretty important, actually, the fixtures, aesthetically. So... can I come in? Yeah. I'm sorry. Come on in. So I know I said those first, but I have landed on that one. What do you like about that one? Ah, it's delicate, but, um, it seems pretty robust. You know what I mean? - I m... I mean... - Oh, shoot. - Hm. - What's wrong? Was playing a little basketball and I think I pulled somethin'. - Oh. - Right there. Hm. Oh. Um... Right there. - Feel that? - Yeah, actually, I, I do. Okay. Let me just, uh... Right there. Um... I have to go. You gotta go right now? Yeah. Uh, I gotta go. I mean, uh, can you believe that she's on her third divorce? - With six kids? - Like, can you keep a man? - Hey! - Oh! - Oh! Surprise! - Surprise! Oh, my goodness! I had no idea! We know! We know. - Hey, beautiful! - Hey. Oh, Sonia, when did you have time to decorate? Whatever, Tiff. So, and that's like, three different kids... My car wouldn't start. Girl... I know when you're lying. This really is beautiful. Well... wait till you see the cake. - Ooh! - Can I say what this one is? - Go out with a bang. - Whoa. - Oh... - Mm-hmm. I got you lace. It's about being classy and naughty. So give me the real. Does sex get better or worse over time? Oh, girl, every marriage is different, right? - Yeah, yeah, we schedule it. - Wait, what? Okay, wait, so I, you know, I schedule nail appointments, hair appointments, but I have never scheduled a... Yeah. Have three kids and then come talk to me. Oh, you got it. Okay. Have any of you ever had an affair? Okay, you know what? Ground rules. Uh, no guilt-trippin', code of silence. - Okay. - Okay. Have you two done anything? He touched my wrist. Okay. Wait a minute. It's not funny. - We cannot laugh. - No. You mean to tell me this man touched your wrist and got you acting like that? - I wasn't done. Um, he... - Okay. He grazed my neck with his... - With his? - With his, his what? - His lips, Janice, okay? - Oh. - Okay. - Wrists and lips, girl... Sometimes I wonder, have I ever experienced everything I need to experience? I, um, ahem... I stepped out on Drew. What? - When? - Couple of years ago. We've been trying to work it out ever since. Been to therapy, couples retreats, you name it, and it just hasn't been the same. Tiffanie, word of advice. It's not worth it. Okay, this is a bridal shower, not Fix My Life. - Tiffanie girl, we love you. - Yeah. - And Damon's a good man. - Mm-hmm. He's gorgeous, and most importantly, he loves some Tiffanie. - Yeah. Yeah, he does. - He does. Look, we are your tribe, girl, and we are here to protect you, so, ladies, let's make sure we stay prayed up for Tiff, all right? You might wanna start them prayers now. - You think? - After communion. - We love you, girl. - Love you. ♪ Tell me what you wanna do yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah is this what you wanna do Yeah ♪ ♪ Get me going get me up 'cause oh yeah ♪ Chef Louise, thank you. Come on now, say something. I never thought I could make this kinda money going legit. This is crazy! But I got some things I gotta take care of at the house. Come on now, talk to me, man. I ain't seen my son yet. Wait. Since you've been released? Yeah. It's been like four months, man. What you been doing? I've been working. I ain't trying to go home empty-handed. I was right there when your pops pulled a no-show every weekend. All those hours you waited for his ass to show up. You know what it's like to not have a father around. Hey, hey. - Hey. Ah. - Yeah, what's happenin'? Hey, Trey, this is Eric, my chief operating officer, my confidante and all that. Uh, Eric, this is Trey, that's my brother from another mother. Trey, yeah, I've heard wonderful things. - I'm honored. - Well, listen, uh... I come bearing exciting news. We have landed Justus. - Oh, yes! Ah-ah! - Yes. - Oh, man, I am so proud of you! - Hey. - Thanks for giving me the shine. - I knew you had it. I knew you had it. Ah! Whoa! I'm telling you, let's drink to this. Yeah. This is it, Trey, definitely wanna jump on there. It's actually a really generous offer, Trey. Yeah, our entry-level positions actually start out at half that. Well, I'm worth it, though. Ain't I, bruh? Hey, bro, but how about we have some sushi, huh? - Mm. Hey. - Yeah. So where'd you go to school, man? Uh, Vanderton. Well, for law school, that is. - Vanderton. Wow. - Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm trying for my GED. You think I can get in there? I mean, brother, I think you could do anything you want. Yeah. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Yeah, right. Oh, man, you know, back in the day... You know what? Let's bow our heads, okay? Dear Heavenly Father, please bless the food that is on our plates and bless the hands that prepared it. In Your Son's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Like I was saying, you know, back in the day, the only lawyer Damon ever needed was a public defender. You know what I'm sayin'? Please, do not tell those stories. Ah, this-this one's funny, man. Look, it was like a buck twenty and... Damn it! Trey, please. I said enough. Well, let's have some sushi, all right? - It's a good day. Hey. - Yeah. Do you think we should have waited till marriage to have sex? Do you? I don't know. Maybe. And why are you asking this now? Hm, maybe we should try. Try what, baby? Celibacy. Let's wait until our wedding night. You okay? That is just silly. Why is it silly? Because we're get married in a couple of days. - So what's the point? - Forget it. Oh, what, what's goin' on with you? You have not been acting like yourself lately. What, is a wisp of hair out of place? Well, where are you going? Back to your apartment? Downstairs. Cooling off. Trey... Yes. Tiffanie? Compromise? What? Pastor Cooper said that compromise was one of the bedrocks of marriages. And if you wanna be celibate, it's okay with me. Thank you. The food tasting's at 4:00, and I want you to come. What? You actually want to include me? Yes. And I have a surprise for you. And if you don't show up, I'm gonna start buying you Prince CDs. Love Jones. Come on, challenge me. Tiff, you still love me? Of course I do, silly. Okay. I'll see you then. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Damn! Since when did we start talking to each other like that? I don't have time for this. You were supposed to wire me the money. We had to press pause on some stuff. I'll handle it. - Are you sure, boss-lady? - Yeah. I was officially in the danger zone. Not handling my business, being a bad friend and a worse fiancee. I didn't know this woman. This self-destructive mess was a stranger to me. - I got two sandwiches. - I can't. I'm meeting Damon. Come on. Even CEOs got to eat. All right. What you got? This is the one with him in his costume. Aww, look at your little superhero. Aww, it must have been really hard to be away from him. It was. So, why a spa? Oh, self-care, you know, it strengthens the foundation. Alleviates stress, which increases happiness. You'd be surprised what a simple head massage would do. I've never had one. - No way. - Ever. Come here. Mm! Okay. Damn, girl. Trey, we can't. Baby, we've already started. Everything is ready. Heard anything yet? You know, she's probably just caught up at work. Yeah. Let's stick with the lobster. Okay. Well, the, uh, stylists are on the way with the tuxes. Thank you. This is Tiffanie. Please leave me a message. Hey, baby. Uh, where are you? Trey, there's people right outside. I'm sayin', just one kiss. Then I'll leave. Wow. Oh, Tiffanie, you look so beautiful. I can't wait for Damon to see you in it. - Aww... - Oh, God! Damon! - What? - We were supposed to meet. It's dead! It's dead! Breathe, breathe, mama. Sonia, I'm about to screw everything up. Listen, now, I'll call Damon and tell him you got held up at work. - Just finish the fitting, okay? - Okay. You have some things you need to work out, but just not right now. - All right. Hold on. Mm-hmm. - I got you. - I got you. - Call him. Oh, yeah, it's gonna fit. It is gonna fit nice. I've been thinking about you often, man, you know, joining the company. I'm in. I'm all the way in. So the boys are back together again. Yeah. At least something's going right. What you mean, bro? Why you all gloom and doom? Tiff. She didn't show up for the tasting. Well, she was at the spa earlier. - What were you doing at the spa? - She didn't tell you? Bro, I'm doing the lights. Doing the lights, man. But this Armani, though. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. You don't wanna marry me, do you? Damon, all I did was forget. Tiff, you didn't just forget. Either you're distant or you're annoyed. You tell me you don't want my help, but then I find out that Trey's working at Urban Utopia. You can stop me anytime, Tiff. I'm just so overwhelmed with everything... Baby... that song's played out. Sometimes I think we got together for the wrong reasons. What do you mean? Well... You, you met me, girl from the church, pure. And you thought I'd be good for your image. That's not true. I was a ball of clay and you molded me into your idea of the perfect woman. And I let you. Maybe we should think about postponing the wedding. Tiff, our wedding, that's in 48 hours. Now, I know we got some things that we have to work out, but we have our whole entire lives to do so.

Well, I'm gonna make sure you safe. Everything was fine until you came around! If everything was fine, you wouldn't have kissed me. - I don't do this. - Maybe you've been hiding. Maybe you're becoming who you are. You don't know me. I hate you! I hate you! Go! No. No. Tiffanie? 'Cause I want you to be prepared. - Yes. - Yes. ♪ And you're getting married ♪ ♪ You're getting married ♪ Your mama would be so proud. - Grandma. - I'm proud. Oh, golly! Oh.

Look at this man right here. Hey, family! We're not finished partying just yet, okay? But I do wanna take this moment to thank you all for coming out, supporting me and my beautiful bride-to-be. I'm grateful. Yeah. And the reason why I'm grateful is because of this beautiful woman right in front of me. You know, I'mma save all those poetic words for my vows tomorrow. But I do wanna take this moment to acknowledge my queen. Thank you for saying yes. Look good tonight, Tiff. So in the spirit of gettin' down, I wanna dedicate this next tune to my beautiful bride. Hey. These guys... I'll be back. But seriously, this, this is beautiful. - It really is. Wow. - The views! Oh, it's nice. Oh... Did you sleep with him? No. But I want to. You want me to stay?

If only, if only, if only... But when I look back, we were speeding towards this moment the day we met. Tiffanie... You want me? Yes. Mm-hmm. How bad do you want me? Bad. Take this off. - Answer one more question. - Mm-hmm. What would Damon say if he saw you like this? What? Damon was my brother. I would have died for him. I thought he would've done the same. But he screwed me over. And all I've dreamt about for seven years is revenge. So when your punk-ass husband brings you here tomorrow night... you think about this. You think about me. No... No... No... Oh, no. What have I done? Tiffanie? Tiffanie. Oh, it's all right, she's fine. Thank you. Tiff... Tiff? Tiffanie, it's grandma. Honey, what's the matter? Huh? What's the matter, baby? - Yo? What up, babe? - Hm? Come on, come on, come on. It's time to get it right. Yeah! Met someone last night. - At Willard Park? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Beautiful, smart, kinky. Oh, yeah? Already? Oh, me, I mean, you know how I do. I mean, we played around a little bit. You know what I'm sayin'? But, uh, Tiff made you wait, huh? - No, she made me work. - Hm. Yeah, you know, she gone and asked me the other day, "Baby, do you think we should have waited?" I'm like... - "What are you talking about?" - Whoa, whoa, bro, bro, bro. You goin' soft on me, man? No. I just don't want my lady living with regret. Trey, speaking of regrets, seven years ago... No. No. No! We're not gonna do that today, bruh. Look, about any of that, what's done is done. I feel a lot better after last night, man. I got a lot off my chest. My brother. Now, let's get to it. Come on, man. - It's your day, baby! - Look at that, clean! - That's what you doin'? - Yeah. That's what you doin'? Hoo. Well, this is some revenge plot. Trey must've been working on this for a long time. Seven years. And why is Damon be so oblivious to his hatred? He had me fooled, too. I think he's gonna tell Damon. Well, he hasn't told him yet. Don't you let Trey win. He's taken enough already. Do you think I have time to get my dress steamed? Thank you. Well, go on, honey. Come on. You think about this. You think about me. Tiff? Hold on a second. L-ladies and gentlemen, listen. We will, we gonna, we will be right back. Right back. Tiffanie? - Can I come in, please? - I can't do it. Open the door, Tiff. Baby, what's going on? Damon... Please, you can't tell me you can't marry me. I messed up. What's wrong? What happened? I was with someone. You cheated on me? Who is he, Tiff? Who is it, Tiff? It's over. It doesn't matter. - I'm sorry, Damon. - Yeah, you are sorry? You couldn't tell me this sooner? I got a house full of people down there! My family's down there! Was everything not enough for you? Because that's what I gave you. You asked for it, I gave it to you! Before you came to think about it, I gave it to you! Why, Tiff? I gave you everything! Damon. Open the door, son. Listen to me, son. Listen to me. - You're too angry right now. - I'm so sorry... Go back and talk later when you, when you calm down, all right? Pastor, I would never put my hands on this woman. I understand, son, but you're angry. And-and you wait till you calm down and then talk. I hope it was worth it, Tiff. - I hope he was worth it. - No. - Stop... - I'mma pack your stuff. - Damon... - It's okay, it's okay. - Damon. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Well, how about opening up Urban Utopia? You do remember the spa, right? Your lifelong dream? - I blew the opening. - Look, we'll open when we open. Enough, sis. Look, you gotta stop giving Trey all your power. Okay. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Let's do it. Hm. I got you, girl. So listen, I did get some things, the color scheme that you wanted. Don't you even worry about that. I came to say thank you. When you said that I was hiding, you were right. I'm glad I could do you a solid. Looks like my job is done here. My only regret is that I hurt Damon in the process. He's a good man, Trey. Whatever happened between you, he would never hurt you intentionally. This girl trying to guilt-trip me? Just so you know, I didn't lose a wink of sleep last night. Okay? - Father God in heaven... - Oh, damn, here we go. Please heal Brother Trey's heart. Please remove that anger. - Set him free, Lord. - Look. Hey, get the hell outta here with all that. I'm not doin' all that. Let him know the way to freedom is forgiveness, because there is good in him. - Leave. - He's a good man, Lord. He's just in pain. Please let him know that he's loved, that he matters. In Jesus' name. Amen. You've reached Damon King. Please leave a brief message. Um, I didn't wanna do this, um, on your voicemail, I... You just, you won't take my calls. I... And you have, you have every right not to. I want you to know, though... I will never stop loving you, Damon King. Ever. My soul has this... this big, gaping hole in it and... I'm so sorry. I should have never tried to be perfect, 'cause I'm far from it. But I like this Tiffanie, too. And, you know... and I want you to meet her. I hope you call me back, Damon. Even if it takes 50 years, I hope you call me back. I love you, Damon. I don't know what's up with your boys. Wilding on me. You better tell 'em who I am. You slept with Tiffanie? - You abandoned me that night. - I told you to pack it in. I gave you a call as soon as I found out the place was hot. - You left me a voicemail! - I got two strikes! And I wasn't doing life for your greedy ass! You know what your problem is? You have always been hard-headed and you ain't shit! Your girl would disagree. Look at you. She got you whipped like that. I didn't sleep with her. I could've, though. You should have came after me. No fun in that, playboy. You got to take better care of your women, D. This was like taking candy from a baby. Release. I let you in my damn house, Trey! You want it? You want it? - You want to die? - Do it! If I kill you... that means your son grow up without a father. That's how much I love your son. That's how much I love you, man. Well, son or no son, if I ever see you in my city again... There's something else around here. Let's go! Move! Why Trey? Damon, what happened? Why? He-he was just a deflection. I just couldn't get a grasp on what was happening between us. And I, and honestly I don't know if you... if you saw me for who I really am. And that scared me. You're an amazing man, Damon. Please tell me you didn't do anything stupid. I came close. But that's not me anymore, Tiff. And if that's what you want, Tiff... I want you. You, Damon. My, my heart may never recover. But I'm miserable without you. Can we start over? Hi. My name is Tiffanie. You're gonna let my hand, my hand fall off? So we began again. Can I just feed you cereal every day? - Hm? - Mm-hmm. And I ran point in my own life. I was me. Unapologetically me. Uh, again, the spa is called Urban Utopia. And, uh, we service... We were celibate. I didn't do it for Damon. I did it for me. My relationship with God needed a clean slate, too.
