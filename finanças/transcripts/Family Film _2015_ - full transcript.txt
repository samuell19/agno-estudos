And the battle is over. The winner has earned a well-deserved rest and the loser leaves in disgrace. He'll have to start a family in some other part of the pond. Peace reigns once again beneath the surface. Did you take Otto to get vaccinated? God, I completely forgot. I'll take care of it tomorrow. There are six times as many males as females. If she doesn't stop them, she may drowned under the weight of so many “suitors.” Family Film What are you doing in there? Knock it off right now! Are you out of your minds? It'll be okay, Otto, don't worry, it'll be okay. Have a good voyage, Otto. You too, Mr. Kubin. Bye now. - Goodbye. I put some money on your account but please try not to spend too much. Erik, if you need anything Just tell Anna. Here are your tickets and passports, and there's a credit card too. If you run into trouble Just call Martin. We can skype each other. When I was your age I never dreamed my parents would take off somewhere. Understand? - Yeah. -Have fun, but... But what? Everything in moderation. - Sure, I'll be reasonable. You're my clever one, aren't you? Are you going to miss him? Whom? Otto. Don't worry, it'll be okay. Take care, Otto. We'll call as soon as we get there. We'll be fine, mom. -Bye. -Bye. We'll see you at Christmas. Bye. Look after yourselves. Sure. Bye. Bye. - Hi. - Hi, Anna. Hi, kid... So let's go. - Where should I put the bags? - Mom and dad's room. Want anything to drink? - Uh, maybe... What's wrong? - Nothing. What? You okay, bro? Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Hungry? Want some spaghetti? Sure. - How often do you do it? - Today was the first time. “What if someone's waiting downstairs? - Don't know... That's just it: we don't know. That's the point of the game. You play strange games. What's strange about it? Everyone does it. Nobody wants to be bored. - What do you do when you're bored? - It depends. - Do you watch movies? - Yeah. Surf the internet? Watch soccer? Beat off? - Right? - Everyone does. -Exactly. It's totally predictable and totally boring. Like we try to drive away the boredom by being more and more boring. Hey, where're you going? Mommy's calling. - Right, and he goes running. Hey, it's your turn! Time to strip! Get back here! - Where's Anna? Watching a movie with Kristina. - Uh-huh. We're about to sail to Christmas Island. We're going to see the crab migration. When they reproduce there's supposed to be millions of them. - Is it the kids? - Yeah. Otto says hi. Hey, Erik, how's it going? - Catch anything? - Nope, no luck. So, it's spaghetti? Spaghetti again because I still haven't caught a fish. Mrs. Kotlanova is sick today and 'I'm your substitute. -Cepelka... Here. - Dolanska... - Here. - Flek... - Here. -Hempl... Here. Kubin... Kubin? -Absent, Langer... Here. Mandlova... - Mandlova... - Here. - Millerova... - Here. - Yes. You're dead, you're dead... Kristina owns you! My turn. Hi. - Hotshot, huh? - I'm trying. You're good. Go, go, go! Move it! Howdy! - Erik? - Hi, mom. - Hello, sweetie. How are you? - Fine. How about you? Doing well: favorable winds, going at full sail... - We just sailed the Coral Sea. - It was gorgeous! We also visited an island owned by a millionaire. I'll send pictures. - Where's Anna? - In the kitchen. - Anna? - Coming... - Be careful. - It's so cramped here. - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - Hi, honey. So how are things in the world? Kristina, knock it off. Hello? Anna Kubinova speaking. “What should we have to eat? - Spaghetti. -Again? Okay, pizza. - I want some meat... - Dammit, be quiet! Our parents aren't home. Okay then... Goodbye. How about leek soup? - Let's have the pork chops. Good idea. You're in deep shit, Erik. Sorry we have to communicate in this way, but I promise we'll do whatever we can. - Anna? - Yeah? - Is Martin coming? - Yeah, he'll be here today. Didn't you realize Erik wasn't going to school? No. He left the house with his bag; I thought he was going to school. -How long's he been absent? Exactly two weeks. You hear that? He hasn't been to school for two weeks. Hello, Mrs. Pemerovd. I can assure you that we'll straighten this out. My brother Martin will talk to you... Excuse me, Mr. Kubin, but it seems rather irresponsible to leave a 15-year-old on his own for so long. Listen, we trust our children. I can assure you.. A sister is no substitute for parents. It's too much for them. We're in constant contact, and he's joining us for Christmas. - We'll figure it all out then. - That's exactly the problem. Erik skips school, his grades have gone downhill, and you reward him with a holiday and make him miss another week. You don't understand. 'I solve the problem, not you. - Okay? Erik should... - Please drop it. -Drop what? She can't talk to me like Pm an irresponsible father. I'm sorry, Mrs. Pemerova, I understand your concerns. -I'd like to ask you... “Mom, we should leave this for now. Martin is here and he'll talk to Mrs. Pernerova. - Fine, okay. Bye. Hello. Don't worry, it'll be fine. So it's my fault? I have to make sure he goes to school? Don't worry, I'll talk to him. Things will work out. - It'll be okay. - Dammit... 4 want to go home. What? 4 want to go home! You know that's impossible. No, I don't. No matter what, it would take a while. The nearest possible port Is over a 1,000 miles away. Or you could sink it right here and find the nearest airport. 'Night. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Hi. Hey. Now that we're all here together, there's something I have to say. You, grab your stuff and split. What's going on? Nothing. Just straightening things out. What about Kristina? Anna can have friends stay here but I can't? - It's cool, Erik. - No, it isn’t! Anna's an adult and she goes to class. See ya. Where's Erik? - Don't know. Hey, Erik. How'd you sleep? Erik, my darting, my little cucumber. Life is too short to cry. Are you alright? Yeah. It's funny. What's funny? The people here. You'll get used to It. It's too hot. I'm going. I like this one better. How warm will it be there? 25 to 30. That's great. I'd rather just skip winter and have summer year-round. So come with us. Too bad we didn't think of it earlier. My dad could've bought you a ticket. But I could buy you one; I have the money. You're crazy. You can't buy me a ticket. Come on, it'd be fantastic. What time is it? Erik! Erik! Call dad for me. Well? - They're not online. Shouldn't you go to bed? You have school in the morning. Yes, mom. - You live here alone? - Yeah. Wow, like a haunted house. - It's a plain old family house. - A family house without a family. My grandparents lived here, then my parents and me and my brother. May I call you Kristina? - Of course. What about you, Erik? Any girlfriends? I don't know. - How come? - Thought you had a girlfriend. Really? Tell us about her. “Who is it? Tell us. - Leave him alone. - I'm not hurting him. - Yeah, I have a girlfriend. Her name is Sara Mandlova. We're gonna get married, fuck like rabbits, and have five kids. Right, That's nice. I'm never getting married. I bet you get married at least five times. - What about you, Anna? - I'm going to the bathroom. Come, walk boldly along furry ways, along paths strewn with over-sunned sand. In the midst of the zoo, you will surely be the first to see that inside us, cageless, walks a ravishing, resplendent lion. What a blast, every sidewalk quickly leads to the monkeys. And the only path to rise steeply is the one starting from the sparrows. The only ones still coming to see us, the only ones still coming are those faithful, domestic beasts... How about you, Kristina? Staying in Prague for Christmas? - I'm going home. - Looking forward to it? -Yippee... I'll tell you a joke. What's difference between horse? No. Two guys are chatting Ina café. One asks the other: What'd you get for Christmas? The other says: See that blue BMW across the street? “Yeah.” “Well, I got sweatpants In exactly the same color.” - Goodnight and thanks for dinner. - Goodnight. Bye, Erik. Bye. Anything wrong? Not sure. I haven't heard from my parents recently. Have you heard from them? - No. Maybe they're sailing some place where there's no reception. Don't worry, they'll call. I'm just worried because Erik and I are leaving soon. It'll be fine. Tomorrow? - Sure. Goodnight. - Sleep well. You really have to go? Yeah. I'm scared. - So pack up your stuff. - And you stop being a wimp. Have a good time... my little cucumber. Erik? Bring me your stuff so I can pack it for you. I'll do it in the morning. I don't know whether to pack or not. I think you should. They're sure to call by tomorrow. What if they don't? Should we still go? Let's wait a little longer. No need to panic. - Anna? - What time is it? -Just after eight. Will we make it? We'll have coffee and go. Where are you going? - To the police station. I talked to a detective; we'll see if there's anything they can do. What about me? - Stay here in case they call. They said they were going to Christmas Island, then they were going to meet us at the airport in Port Blair. That's on the Andaman Islands. We were supposed to fly there today. Okay, we'll check into it. Give all pertinent Information to my colleague. Is there anything else we can do? Give me a day or two; I'll be in touch. Sure. Hi, Kristina. Hi, Anna... What are you doing here? 4 thought you left. Hi. Hi. What about you? I met Robert at the train station... - and we partied a little. - That's just great. Sorry. - Man, that hurts! - What's wrong? -It hurts. I barely even started. Don't worry, it'll be done soon. Are you next? No way, I'm not into tattoos. Aren't mermaids more of a guy thing? I'm a mermaid... for guys. It looks more like a sea cow. That's just the swelling. It'll be fine by tomorrow. Will you help me with this? Look... You're so brave, Pl rinse you off. Fuck, maybe it's a fish. Isn't it dead? Where was this? - On Java. Is that the last place they called from? Yes. Are they married? Yes. Aliases... None. What languages do they speak? Czech... English... German. Mental health... Good. Suicide attempts... None. Fears and phobias... Medication... Was Irena taking any pills? - Not that I know of. How were they last dressed? He's in an induced coma. His condition is very serious. He was lying in the snow 0 long he developed hypothermia. Blood tests show that he's suffered kidney failure. We have to determine whether the damage is temporary or permanent. What's that? I checked to see if Interpol put it on their site. And? What about mom? If you're feeling queasy you should wait here a while. That okay? He needs lots of rest. Only small, precise portions of food and drink. The nurse will give you a list of the food he shouldn't eat. When will we know the results of the blood work? We'll let you know within a couple days. Sorry... What will the results tell you? Mainly, it's about blood type and tissue compatibility with donors. What? I can't believe it... Mom! What? I can't believe it. It's fantastic. Hello, my darling girl. Darling. You're both so tan. Where's Otto? He's gone. It was quiet, completely calm... Suddenly, this gale kicked up and flipped the boat on its side. We sank like a rock. My god! Otto disappeared. I could see Irena for a while but the waves were so big I lost her. -The boat was gone... Dad's exaggerating a bit. You can't imagine the horror of spending a whole night in the water. We were saved by a Norwegian family sailing to India. I knew someone would come by sooner or later, but I did not know how close they'd be or if we'd be able to signal them. - How'd you do it? - By screaming. You just have to scream like mad. But we couldn't find Otto... Like a beer? Love one, thanks. Is he asleep? I hope so. The dialysis really wipes him out. I got the results today. And? Erik can have my kidney. Martin... I'm very grateful for your willingness to help Erik. - Don't worry about that now. I just think it'd be better for one of us to give Erik a kidney. I don't think that will make up for it. Excuse me? I wouldn't complicate things. Martin is the ideal donor and if he agrees to do it... Of course I agree. What are you talking about? How am I complicating things? I'm his father and I have a right to know if I can help my son. If you were a proper father maybe none of this would've happened. Are you saying I'm to blame? No, it's my fault, probably more than it is yours. But our priority now is for Erik to recover quickly. He's our primary concern, not us. Is that so difficult to understand? This isn't the world I left when I was sold to the white-coats. Must've changed when I killed my master. Do you want to go back? I don't know. There's nothing up here. I don't think anyone's been up here since it was made. If we don't find food soon, we'll die. I'm not gonna die. Not without a fight. Who are you going to fight? There's no one here. Pl fight... this. We have to change. Change? - Dr. Novotny? - Yes, can I help you? - Igor Kubin, Erik's father. - Irena Kubinova. Ah, yes, the lost parents. Pleased to meet you. I like to know if either of us could give Erik a kidney? But you have the ideal donor. The man... Did he change his mind? - No, he didn't. - But try and understand us. We're Erik's parents and we want to do this for him. Of course. Which of you has Erik's blood type? You, ma'am? I'm type B. Then you can't be the donor. So you must be type 0. Go down and ask the nurse to arrange the additional tests. But doesn't a child have the same blood type as one of their parents? Yes. My blood type is AB. Dr. Novotny? I apologize, but I have to go. A pleasure to meet you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Recently I was thinking... -Know what seems strange? What? How's it possible you never had a family? You're good-enough looking and you're clever enough. - And most of all... - Yeah? You're kind. Kind of noble... and calm. Women don't flock to guys like that. And [ was living with mom. That's right, mom... You've mainly been a son your whole life. I never knew whether to pity or envy you. Why would you envy me? Because you're like a cuckoo bird. What? Have you both known all along, right from the beginning? What? Who's son Erik is. - Don't know. - What don't you know? I suspected... but Irena and I never talked about it. What are you going to do? What do you mean? Are you planning on taking care of your family? Are you going to tell Erik or leave it all up to me? I don't know. “I don't know” is not an answer! You idiot! I spoke to Mrs. Pernerova. She was very kind. She said she'd recommend that Erik be given credit for some of his classes. If all goes well he could finish the year by the fall. If everything's alright of course. Are you going to make dinner? We're out of everything. Will you go shopping? No problem. Shouldn't we talk? We can talk when all this is over. - You and Martin... - There was never anything between us. When I wanted a divorce years ago he actually saved our marriage. Funny, huh? He saved our marriage by giving me Erik. Is that some kind of joke? This is unbelievable: I'm no longer my son's father or my wife's husband. Maybe I'm not even myself. I'd like to ask... .that we go our separate ways after the operation is over. Hello, Irena Kubinova speaking. Otto. Otto. Ottik.
