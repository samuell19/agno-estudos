a Dmitri Astrakhan film suggested and written by Oleg Danilov camera by Sergei Yudayev music by Gleb Belkin produced by Dmitri Astrakhan (Dandelion Childrenâ€™s Home) Hi, kids. Good evening, Madam. Kids Kids (a fantasy) Seven dead bodies, including a member of the Federal Assembly, stabbed by some unknown scamps. Serves them right. Why weren't you there, to do the right thing? You take a knife and stick it in. Of course it was right. But enough of that. All cameras at the home were down, of course. Mister Federal Sitter need not be tracked, nor others. Who were those kids? There's a gang in this city. Artful killers and underage at that. And you all know nothing? How did it go? - As usual. You have blood here. - Kolya, you splotched your sleeve, clean it. You are all right, good boy. Check my back. It's not blood, just mud. Well, this is it. Look here, half a year ago I prosecuted a case of a double murder of the Smirnov family, alcoholics. They had a daughter, Mashenyka. Abused by her mother, going through the garbage, starving. Beaten by her father. The girl threw herself out of the window, dead. Two days later the parents were stabbed. The culprits not found. What's the connection? - You see, there were some odd things. The witnesses stated that the Smirnovs had no guests that night. And there were some kids hanging around outside. Come on! Kids outside, it's crazy! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop! Four months ago I prosecuted a case: A deputy district head, Mr Kozlov, driving drunk, ran over some first-graders at a cross-walk. Three kids, all dead. The judge let him go on probation. Murderer! Murderer! Shame on you, scum! Murderer! Stabbed outside of his house three days after his trial. Culprits not found, case closed. What are you getting at? Was he punished for killing children, too? Is it what you are saying? - So it seems. Wait. Two months ago I was prosecuting a grade school teacher: Mrs Silantyeva, charged with driving a pupil to suicide. A four-grade boy Sinitsin Vasya, hanged himself. She was exonerated as unproven. You people raise freaks and make them hanging themselves. You are freaks. That evening walking home she was murdered. Her throat was cut. Just after the trial. I see. - Now, what do we have? Are we plagued with some people's avengers? It seems so. Pretty nice thing. They're back. Give me the knives. Bon appetite. Is it cutlets again? - It was wieners yesterday. What if it is cutlets, come on, eat! DINING-HALL TEA The avenger-brats must be found. My, we'll find 'em, won't we? - Sure! No problem! I know you plan to hunt for homeless kids at the railway station. They will sign anything, in a police station. And then in three days, this city will see another stabbing. And what will we report then? No thank you man, I need none of your phoneys now. We're showing off too long. We have kids taking arms already. Why did we know nothing about that paedophile orphanage anyway? Nothing? We knew everything. They practically advertise on the Web. - What stopped you? They stopped us! I see. Now. The goodies must be found. I mean the very goodies. Prosecutor is Kuznetsov. But I... - You are the best guy of the section. On every score, on all the reports, on your success rate. - The very best! And it was you who first thought of this avengers thing. To see the connection. Sure! That's all. Dismissed. Come on, let's start working. Comrade Colonel! The contingent of the Champion martial patriotism club at the City orphanage #8 is ready for training. The brigade commander is Ivanov Ivan. Good afternoon, comrades! Good afternoon to you, Sir Comrade Colonel! Yura, in charge. Ivan, come here. Dress. Attention. Right face. At the double. Well... Where did you go last night? To the cinema. The Terrors of the Desert. The Terrors of the Desert? Why didn't you ask for a leave? And why were you out that late? And where did the money come from? Scrounging passers-by? Mister Uncle, will you help me? I didn't eat for three days? I'm a scout, I went under cover and worked in 8 countries. Don't I know your ways? I'll never do it again. Word of honour. Honest. Look here, stop your nightly explorations! You will run into a real nasty gang and then no fighting tricks can help you. OK, I need, eh... ...to change into work clothes. You join the drill. Work out, work out! (Right wheel!) (Jumping about face!) (When I clap...) (Chass? step, right wheel!) (Left wheel!) (Normal running!) Hit, will you! You were lingering! Don't move your body! Just your hand. Come, take, throw! Come, take, throw! Name it! The eye! The left eye! The left eye! Go, Vadik! Wow, did you see that! We've all been trying! Now. That's it. - I scored! Good boy! You were good, Ilya! - Go, go! Oops! Dress, attention! Good afternoon, comrade director! At rest! Good afternoon, children! - Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Work out! Good afternoon to you. - Well... What's up? A training in the Champion martial patriotism club. As scheduled. Oh, I see. Well, it's OK. Work out. I go check our young photographer's club. Yes! Go, go! - And still, Vadim Petrovich, I would not recommend you to teach the kids this thing. Comrade director! Think it over. Young men and women must serve their fatherland. Come on! And they must put their hands where their mouths are! My curriculum is accepted by the commissariat. Vadim Petrovich! - Well? You are drunk. - Who, me? - You are! Ha Ha Ha. Lord, I was wondering what's wrong with me. Whether I caught a cold. And now I know. Vadim Petrovi! - Thank you, thank you! You should be ashamed! - I am! Aren't you a veteran officer? Don't kids look up at you? Shame on you. - Yes, Madam! Now the next exercise. Attention! One against four. Here... ...here... ...take this place. You come here as well, Ilyusha. And the result: seven dead bodies. Right, the scoundrels had it coming, I would do it myself! Are you losing your mind? The last thing we need. What? It was right to stab them, wasn't it? No, it was not. We must sit and wait for the paedophiles to be arrested by Dad. Stop it, Sveta! - Until then they are on the lose. Imagine it's your own son! You'd be the first one to reach for a knife. Will you have the salad? OK. What will they face if you catch them? It's an age thing. We believe they are juvenile. So they go to a correction colony. What if they are not so young? Then it's a prison camp. And at 18 it's life imprisonment. As simple as that. - What if you don't catch them? We will eventually, there's no way out for them. Can I have a drink? - You want some compote? I will. - It means you must catch them befote they are old enough to be put in. Catch them and back to normal. Let's try. Where to find them? Normally, we work with a snitch. Kira, will you have some compote? Sometimes we have evidence. As for now... Our men are sweeping the railway stations for urchins. Nothing so far. Well. If they act so smooth, they know each other well. No street kids. Class mates? Neighbours? N-no, I don't think so. Where do class mates travel together, as a group? They must be living together. Living together? A children's home! - That's it! - They must even have a gymnasium And a housemaster can train them and if he was in the army... we have a possibility! Good boy, Kirochka, good boy! Here you are, like some heroes. Web-wide famous. Some one nick-named you The Babies Now it's your established name. "The Babies"! I am a "Baby"! Come on, guys, give it a break. We have business to attend! Just don't slip up, the adults shouldn't know. - Yeah, it's clear! Yes, of course, sure thing. Well, did you find him? Here he is. Tomorrow he gets back from Moscow at 9:32 AM by train. I hacked their data base and searched for his tickets from Moscow, time and date. - You are cool. OK, I got it. Tomorrow is weekend, no classes. Watch out for cameras. So tomorrow it is you, you, you and you. And me? You promise it for so long. Sorry. Next time. Natasha, come here. And me? - And me? You'll have your chance, we have plenty of work. How can you say that? Always the same thing! Don't you worry. You are our brains! We have to keep you safe. - Well even so! It's not fair! Your turn next time. - It's OK, nothing personal. You did upset Marya Vassilyevna by failing to present your Russian exercise book and such. Is it you that she complains to? Is it? Yes, to me. I am your older brother so I am in charge. I'm already a big girl. So I can decide what I present and what not. Well. *** One year ago *** *** One year ago *** Come on, mom, wait till you're home! Vanechka! What joy! My little boy! And where is Natashenyka? - Natasha went to your place, to clean up. Well, I am submitting my appeal. To the supreme court, to the procurator. You've been submitting it for 5 years now. I am now, sonny. I am, I am submitting! They had no right to rob Dad and me of our parental rights, didn't they? How come my babes go to an orphanage when their parents are alive? (Come, mom, stop it!) It's not legal, sonny! Daddy, what are you doing! - Do what your daddy tells you! Get out! (Daddy!) How dare you! - My dear daughter! (Daddy, don't!) Fuck off, woman. (Daddy!) You are big now, (It hurts!) Daddy, don't! - Come on, honey, stop beating your daddy. Stop kicking around, bitch! - Daddy, let me go! It's nothing. It's nothing, you weren't here. You were not! You just weren't here! You were not! You've been at your children's home. And I go to my Verka. They are early birds there, and I will say I've been there since early! They wouldn't know if I have been since early. It's really nothing. Just nothing. Let's go. Come on, we are leaving! It's over and you haven't been here at all! Come on, come on! Come on, let's go. And I... I go to my Verka. Come on, let's go. My how you grew? Vanyka, Vanyka, look at you! Big man! Well, you better! You should have grown in half a year ! Well, you made the place cosy. - Come on, come on, sit down. Yesterday I was summoned to the investigator again. I was frightened, thought it could be something bad. But he went like this: It's over, he said. It's been half a year and the case is now closed. It seems, he said, your husband was killed by drunks. They were never found, and that's it. So far so good! And my Verka, what a person! Verka and her husband swore I had been at their house. Now she says, if it was you, I won't say a word, I'll swear anything you need. Well, I say I never. And she says come on, I'm blessed with the same fortune too. And those cops never even searched. They don't care. The very investigator was drunk that morning. Well, we are safe. My first thought was: Now you can call. We have nothing to fear now. I called your principal. I said tell my babes they can come visit! So you just like that, eat, yes, eat. Eat. Vany, come on, Vany! - But mom, look here. I see you cross yourself all the time like a believer. Well, I killed my father! I sinned! God should punish me! What is left to enjoy? Vanya, don't say that. You did a holy deed, Vanechka. Vany, you saved your little sister. You saved me, Vany. It's true, Vanechka, to kill is a sin. To kill a man, that is. A mortal sin, Vany. But was he... a man? What kind of man was he, your dad? I tell him the same thing! This is... this is Petya. Pyotr Semyonich. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - It is. That's about it. Look here, I keep wondering. Am I sick, abnormal? Take that day. I didn't care for father. Like it's a thing to do. No remorse, no tears. Nor the days after. Our sugar daddy wanted me... his own child... you know what! If it was not for you... Now you want to feel sorry! Well, you can! Feel sorry for that teacher! Who made a kid hang himself! Sorry for the fuckers who starved their daughter! For Mr Member of yesterday! And for our sugar daddy! Who beat on mom. Who was the reason why the two of us were taken to the orphanage! All right. I was just wondering. Everything is as it should be. Those guys who prey on people have to be killed. Those guys never learn. And it will put fear in others. Did you do your Russian? I will. Well, right. Let's go. Have you composed our advertisement? - I have. Good. - Well. Look here. Don't worry. We are taking you along tomorrow. Show me this big shot again... OK. Watch out. Come on, what're you doing, it wasn't me! (I'll choke you!) Stop it, cool down, it was a joke. - OK, leave him alone. Idiot. - It's alright, Artyom. Well, they made a joke. You fix it. Come on, calm down, we'll fix it now. Come on, Illya, tell us. - Natasha? Why are you here? Bed time for you! May I listen too, just a little? Well, they entered the cave. What's next? They entered the cave. All was in subtle half-light. There were strange murmurs and moans. Suddenly... a wall shifted silently to open up a narrow dark passage. And out of that darkness... Eh... Come on, tell us what happened next! Wait a minute, I haven't thought it up yet. OK, here it is. Suddenly out of the dark came a skeleton with a machine gun and said: Get lost, you brats! We don't need any of you here! And then they had to... Citizens passengers. Now you will witness the execution of citizen Sevastyanov Konstantin Igorevich. This man, being physician-in-chief at the children's hospital #3, denied a city-paid surgery for 7 year old Yegor Skvortsov as he blackmailed Yegor's mother. With the boy dying on his mother Sevastyanov kept deferring. - Comrade Captain, what's this? The mother sold her place and brought the money for the surgery, but it was too late. Look here, I know the story. The bugger was on TV. Put your knife aside, I will read. Without my knife you're liable. There may be cameras around. Please, read on. Look here, those paedophiles in the orphanage were done by you, weren't they? They were. So you are the Babies? Yes we are. Now will you read? Sure, sure. After Yegor died his mother went to court. Sevastyanov was brought to justice for negligence, but then he was rehabilitated. Currently citizen Sevastyanov still holds his position of hospital's chief. - I think it's him! It means he can blackmail more parents (And that's them, see!) for medical attention. And those parents who fail to pay up, will see their children die. - The Babies! We are those who are nick-named The Babies. Since the court failed to stop Sevastyanov, we will. - At your command, Sir comrade Captain! Wait. No hurry. You got me wrong. The execution of the citizen Sevastyanov is due at the central hall of the railway station. - See, here, see. It's them. And we, our whole force, will block the East exit. Well, we do have to react. We must go and shoot the creep. Destroy him by any means. We, not them. Yeah, right... OK. Attention! All staff concentrate at the East exit. Look, it's him! Let me through! Let go! Good morning! Don't! Don't, I beg you, don't! Don't! Help! Help, I beg you, help! Kiddoes, don't do it! Guys! Doctor! - You again! - Doctor, please, do the surgery! Once again the same thing. - Doctor, I beg you, Please! - Don't do it! Babies, don't! My son is dying, I beg you! - Stop your hysterics! I beg you, don't do it! Well, enough is enough! - My child is dying! I'll get the money! - Well! I'll pay up! After you pay, then we operate. Don't do it, I beg you! Don't! Don't do it, guys! Help! Help! Please, don't! Don't! Thank you very much. Sorry. Well? We have nothing to go on. No witness. How comes, no witness? At the railway station? Crowds, hundreds of people! Yes Sir Comrade Colonel. All eyewitnesses were interviewed. - They tell stories. Anrey Andreich! (What stories?) How is that even possible! Is it safe to even walk home? - Some say there were five assailants! Some say there were three. Or twelve as one eyewitness says. Reported are bearded peasants, terrorists wearing masks, and criminals wearing coats over their bare torsos! Even tattooed thieves! - Anrey Andreich! People say eight criminals at the railway station stabbed some guy. Sit down! They surely shot videos on their cell phones, but as to post them on the Web, no one did! For the same reason, to protect the Babies. I don't understand. - Well it's easy. The people won't tell on them to help them, at least in this way. Precisely! In this way for now! What's seen on cameras? Well, the cameras show some kids. So they are yours? - Stop it, Oleg. The cameras show some kids. Their hoods are up, no faces to speak of. And even with some faces we have nowhere to go. Where can we search? They are just some kids. I see. And why was that doctor not in jail? How do I know! He might have bribed the judge. He might have done a surgery jumping the queue, how do I know? I see. To face an army of 100,000 Napoleon went alone. He came up and said: My soldiers! If you want to shoot down your Emperor, here I stand before you! Cool! Well? Marshal Ney, with tears in his eyes, dropped on his knees in front of the Emperor and begged his pardon. And the soldiers cried: Long live Napoleon! Out with that lousy king Louis! And all of them as one man turned around and left for Paris. Catch it! It's here. Pass. Pass to me! - Take me in! I know whom to kill. Our neighbour wants to join, but he is 38. Kill our teacher, she's a fool! Funny. See where we are due. They started selling bad dope. Real poison. And at schools at that, at discotheques. Kids dying, kids going nuts. It's horrid. OK. I see. I saw on the Web the correct way to play a chord, like this. Bullshit. The next thing I'll have to kick along, won't I? - Give it a try. Stop it, he's coming! I feel like a fool just trying! We are going tomorrow. At the third period. It's the morning to have everybody in class. Can we go at the second period? We have algebra after that. We can't miss it. Algebra is a must-go. And you know it. - We go at the third one. OK. You can say afterward we saw a movie. Idiots! Will you have enough? Idiot! Why are you laughing? OK, that's enough, stop it. See how they ruined my bed. Now, guys, go fix it. And it's bed time anyhow. It's OK, don't get mad, we will fix it. Vany, do I come along? Will you give me a knife? No. Not tomorrow. - Why not? I train at Uncle Vadya too! I can! Not fair! It's OK, you will come along some day. You are our brain-power! We must keep you safe! OK, guys, so long! - Natasha? Wait a minute. - What is it now? You'll see. - Don't start now! Not fair! You promised! - You'll have your day! Ilya, you are our brain-power! We must keep you safe! Aren't you smart, Ilya! Where did you get it from? Ma and Pa taught me to read when I was 3. I used to read a lot. It was a raiding party. Ilya's parents were in some big business. They were attacked. His father would not give it all away willingly, put up a fight. Both parents were killed, the house taken. There was no family to take in Ilya. Maybe they just won't. He ended up here. Did you do your Russian? Yes, I did! I presented it already! You can ask that teacher woman! Well! Any achievements? We checked every children's home in the city and in the region. Three are suspect. One has a boxing teacher, who started a ring there. Another one has an ex jailer from a correctional colony. He may be a veteran gang leader. The third one has a colonel from GRU. He worked in several countries, afterward he was training commandos. My! B-but ... how did he end up at a children's home? Kicked out everywhere and by his wife too. No kids of his own, started at a children's home. Started a patriotic martial arts club. I see. Well, watch those three homes and try to squeeze something from eye-witnesses! Andrey Andreich! Andrey Andreich, - I do what I can! - I hope so! I'll try hard! - All dismissed! Kuznetsov! Don't forget to put those homes under surveillance! OK. Hi, it's me. Nothing goes on, everyone went to bed. Yes Sir, I keep watching. It took 2 hours to take out that stain, I stayed up till midnight. The whole school was watching it! Adults and children. And no witness willing to cooperate. Some tell tales, some say they saw nothing. They do the right thing. Don't you see we must stop crimes? These are crimes! Have you all lost your mind? The perpetrators must be stopped. You just do everything wrong! You better catch paedophiles and corrupt doctors. As for the station case, it was you who told me about it! Those Babies would have no job! - Right! Well, I say! Yes! What? What!? No! No!! Never! And warn them! Give them this warning! If they even try, they'll be brought to court! It's final! And my message to them: they'll have plenty. Cut! Who was that? - Our idiotic PR man just called. He wants a TV debate. A dispute. "What are those children: bad guys or superheroes?" That figures! And what harm is in it? The harm is that after the story they'll end up as superheroes! You all jump on the table, break tableware, shout. In short, divert. And I jump him from the back. Halt! In that orphanage where paedophiles were stabbed, was it you guys? And the doctor at the station? And that pusher at the school yard? You thought I had no clue? In fact I got the idea pretty soon. As soon as you made it on TV. Is this what I'm teaching you? Is there anything else, Uncle Vadya? Well, we march home now to sort it out! There's a man talking! Do you know who he is? It's Captain Morogin!- Well? - A soldier who did something wrong. The captain personally taught that soldier a lesson, An 18 year old was permanently paralyzed! It is OK really. Thank God he's alive Is it the story I saw on TV? Yes, the same man, it's him. It was a scandal. People got involved. The procurator said he was taking action. But to no avail. No witnesses who saw that it was him, who did it. On the Web the soldiers are speaking out, at the court they are silent. Who wants to stand against the army? In short, the case is closed. Now the captain is celebrating. - Yes! What do we do, Uncle Vadya? Do we go home? A commanding officer. An officer... No way! Put it away. You stay here. Ever grateful, brothers that you stood by me! That you cared for me! - Soldiers need a lesson! Those buggers! - They don't understand! So the court sorted it out! There it goes! Is it your birthday? Congratulations. Thanks. - Good evening. Fill up - drink up. Fill up, drink up. Give me your knife. Eh? - Uncle Vadya, what do you mean? What, you want to watch? Well, watch. So... What the hell! You're a treat! - Shit happens... Done. Everything beneath the waist line is paralyzed. I repeat, everything. And it's permanent. He's young enough, no heart issues. He has some 40 years lying on his back ahead. That guy stays in bed and this man will keep him company. What, you don't feel your legs? Well. What is it, after all? - What is it already? What, what, I don't feel my legs! Get up, will you? - Somebody call for a doctor. Please? Stop this thing, OK? - I don't feel my legs, call a doctor! A doctor, is there a doctor here? - I've no idea what's wrong with me! Uncle Vadya, how did you do it? A human body has several points on its surface. When I was gripping his arm, I pressed the right point. I could have killed him, but he better lives. Will somebody make a call! - Help! You freaks just learn the hard way! What is it, my legs don't work. You don't understand, do you. He was never sick, never! What now? Now you understand, don't you? What is it already? - Dear, I've made a phone call! I already did! Help! Uncle Vadya! Will you teach us? Teach us! Sure! We're going home, doves! To sort it out. Call for a doctor, somebody! Brothers. I see the reason. But you can't do that! How could you? What if you make a mistake? Kill the wrong guy? We will never make a mistake. "Thou shall not kill" is a commandment! What about wars? Our soldiers fighting the Nazi weren't wrong to kill 'em, were they? Hush. That's not the same, OK? Still, this commandment better be disobeyed sometimes, right? When a war is waged against us, right? Well, it is waged against us now! And you know it! Good Lord! What do they make wieners of? - Of wieners? Of paper, of course. So you don't want yours? - I do! No way! - Why not? Never hurts to try one! I wonder what do they make cutlets of? - Of buns! Will you take a look, Vadim Petrovich. There's someone called Tamara-oglu. This is her house. She controls the traffic. Forget it! Don't you dare! Can't you see? It's guarded with machine guns! Dogs! Surveillance! Not funny! We did put a pusher away. Didn't help at all. - They just go by two now. One pushes, the other keeps watch. That's all to it. There was a local cop who tried to fight, he caught a couple. The pair was let go, the cop was killed. They gave him a honourable burial - Just so! Uncle Vadya! Kids are dying. Can you help, please? Well. Your task is to watch the house. Learn their schedule. - Yep! Departing times, arrival times. OK! Alright! With Lord's grace! The point is to know whether there are kids around the house. The kids can not be hurt. Yep. Sure. OK. The rest is mine. Finish your meal and go to bed. OK! - Sure! Come on, guys, get sane. There's a boy of about 12 and a younger girl. Must be her grandchildren. Yep. They drive them to school at 8:30 and back at 3 3 or 15? - 15 in the afternoon. Then say so, report properly! - OK! Tamara mostly stays at home. She has visitors coming to her. Well, what's the piece of junk for? It gets in early in the morning. At about 2 they drive it away. At about 6 it's back. They must be delivering goods. - Well, I see. Did you shop? We did. As you said, Uncle Vadya, we went separately and on different times. - Well Yura went to a drugstore. Artyom for yeast, Natashka for soap. And I was the kid sent for milk. I see. Well. I can fetch some water. - So, you mix it and it blows up? Here is a spoon. Stir it! - Uncle Vadya, there must be some know-how to it. Will you teach us? - You wish! Now this is the plan. Tomorrow I go alone. You stay away. Not fair, Uncle Vadya? - No, it's none of your business. Yes. Sure. Time to study. I do my skeleton maps. - I must work at geometry. I see. You're getting your asses there no matter what. Don't screw my brains! - I know you are. Cut it out. Well. Children's Hospital No 19, OK? OK. - Sure. - Tomorrow, at 8:30. Stand by the window. Yep. - The second window on the third floor. Yep - OK. - Just across from the fluorography. Yep. - You will see everything. And won't miss your classes. Only 20 minutes late. Say you overslept. It's going to rain. There comes Uncle Vadya. - Yep. He dropped a package, I wonder why. Ha! Out of cigarettes. Why wonder? It can't be that. Where is he going? Is it over? - Be quiet. Not much of a diversion. - Did it go wrong? - Be quiet. What was that?! What the-?! Who did this?! Where were you, creeps? Go catch who did it! He left the packet inside. I can see it. Ouch! Wow! - Cool! - I knew it! Thousands of posts. And everybody thanks the Babies for smashing the viper and saving all the kids. They know it was us. - Ha Ha. - Who else! You see now, Uncle Vadya, you were good, you saved kids. I see. - Here is our present! - Happy New Year! Thanks to you from all the kids. Is it nicked? - Why, never, Uncle Vadya! - The whole home chipped in! OK, now cut it. You can't change the world. No use to try. Well, for special cases like today, I will sort it out by myself, won't I? And you, the Sweet Babies, stop the quest now. Thanks. Well, I have good news: In 3 days after you know what, the sale of illegal drugs is down by 83%. My congratulations, comrades. I see. The pushers used to feel safe and now they are scared. - I wonder who used to guard them? Yes, who? Forget it. OK, we all screw up. What now? Eyewitnesses saw some kids hanging around Tamara's place for a few days. Kids again. Are they the Babies? And on that day the secret agent housemaster from the children's house went away early. What does it mean, "away"! You lost him? Comrade Colonel, the earth seemed to swallow him up in front of our watching men! Well. This kind of explosive is used the same way secret agent Shiroky did. The earth seems to have swallowed him up at the very same time. Everything points to that children's home. Have the place surrounded. Watch their every step. Ouch! - Dismissed! It's a boy. They told me yesterday. Ah! He kicks! Cool! Where is Uncle Pyetya? He went to help his folks in the country chopping wood and such. Mum. What's wrong? Are you tired? Not feeling right? I have a question. Those kids, the Babies, That's you? Yes. I see. Vanyechka, Natashenyka, my little darlings you do the good thing, it serves those creeps right. But what if it gets out? I will be OK, but will he? When he grows up and goes to school, will he be shunned? "If he hates you he stabs you." His brother and sister do it. What will the neighbours do, what will the people at my work do? It's great to say: "The Babies, our Champions!" And all that when the Babies live in some other place. But to have the Babies around. And Pyetya, if he finds out he can get scared and just flee. And I thought I'd get a life. A life. You seem to care for strange people, so you just protect them. But what you do to your own folk, what do you care? I won't apply for my parental rights. Let it stay the way it is. And no more visits from you. They have been shadowing us for a week or more. I didn't want to frighten you too soon. It looks like they are on to us! It seems that not all the police are idiots. Step away from the window! Vanya. Vanya, think of Natasha. What will become of her if you don't quit? - We can't change our ways now. And we don't want to, it's my fate and Natasha's. Yeah! - And you guys can decide for yourselves. My Daddy killed my Ma. He was drunk. Hit her on the head with a bottle. She was complaining for ages, asked for legal help. If we had been there in time she would still be alive. Just so! - Look here! My parents were killed by bandits who never got punished. What do you think I should do? Vadim Petrovich? I think it's perfectly clear. I just can't find the bastards. No database registered them. We will find them yet. - We surely will. And then as one man they hit on their enemies, their proud banner of liberty flaunting overhead. Drums beating and nothing on earth could stop them. And what happened next? - The enemies got scared and fled! Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Please look here! We are the Babies. Your chief was bribed to feed the kindergartens with busted food, resulting in mass poisoning and 4 kids dead. He knew he was feeding the kids poisonous stuff. You knew it too! - No we didn't! No more lies, we did! Don't! No! A-a-ah! Right, no more lies. According to this agreement, next week you would be going to distribute another shipment of poison to kindergartens. Don't do it. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Go away! Lieutenant Colonel Yegorov! You head the draft board. The draftee Sergey Sinitsyn had a cardiac defect. You had all the reports, his mother grovelled at your feet. You, who are you? - The Babies. To reach your draft quota you sent Sergey to serve. The private Sinitsyn died after his first exercise. We are the Babies, ever heard of us? You play loud music at nights. Your neighbours complained, you told them off. People can't sleep. Me... No, guys, not me. - You go home, fetch your audio and drop it from the window. We'll stay to watch. - OK! OK! Sure. Sure. I... I'll do it, I will. I'm coming. Wait a second, I'll do it. Hold it! You can listen to it using your earphones. OK. Where are we going? - To court. Oh. What's the problem? - I already told you. I was on mess hall duty! There was this guy who was sentenced to 18 years, but he didn't do it and wasn't even in the city, as confirmed by 3 eyewitnesses. Still they jailed him to look good. A month later he was killed. And the judge still has her job. OK, I see. That's her. Uncle Vadya! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! What do I do, Lord? They don't listen. They keep on killing. They are tough to follow! I caught them once, they are more careful now. Help me, Lord! But they are too young! Save them, Lord, teach them! What do you think, they are those Babies? Any ideas? My son read somewhere Judgement Day is coming. And? We have angels of revenge sent to us for our sins. Well, they are long due. You all should stop searching for the Babies and thank them! The best thing authorities can do is step aside and mess no more! Mum! - What? They have to get information from the Web. I mean about their jobs. So? You look for the worst outrage with kids being hurt and wait for those guys to come. The trouble is we have 1000s of cases. The Web is full of them. That's what I always say. - What to choose... no chance to guess. Well, we must set up something real bad with you watching! Say it again? Some fishing expedition. You told me everything about it. You better not plant ideas. Consider a place out of the city, a sanatorium camp where kids are butchered for their organs. One boy escapes and posts everything on the Web. I think it will work. Interesting. Interesting! An option! - Well? - I'll report to the colonel! Ha Ha! Good boy! Good boy Kirusha! An option! An option. An option. This is from the railway station surveillance cameras. And this is from our agents. Check these out. They do look alike. Well. Well-well-well. It is getting better. But we must catch those Babies in the act, or the people won't accept it. OK. - Kuznetsov, is your youth camp ready? One moment. And this is the camp. - Well, go on. And this... we'll post on the Web. Some strangers caught me and took me to a dormitory with about 50 kids of mixed ages. They said we were to have surgery the next day. Is that your boy? It is. I would say he's able. But wouldn't his classmates see this and recognize him? He has told the whole school he was abducted and they sympathize! Cool! It may work. Well. Our agents outside the children's home must be called back. OK. Let the Babies feel free... to act. ...have our surgery the next day. I saw a boy of about 10 wheeled outside not breathing. They threw him on the van. When every one was asleep I noticed an upper window was not locked. I got out. The guards were asleep, they drank a lot. I walked up the highway and got a lift home. My parents and I went to the police but they didn't believe us and told us to go home. I want everybody to know that they kill kids there to sell organs. Tchaika Sanatorium, station Vysokaya. They can catch them all! I am interested. Very much so. Guys, guys, guys, guys! Those folks went to the police, let the authorities deal with it. You are joking! What will the authorities do? Re-enforce security to prevent more escapes. And they might go for that boy eyewitness too. Right! - Sure! I would visit the place. To see what's up. Yes. Now, Uncle Vadya, it's bed time. Good night, well? A moment, Illusha. Play it again. Some strangers caught me and took me to a dormitory That's better than police talk. to have surgery the next day. Kiryusha! (Hi Dad) Kiryusha! Kirochka, it works! Today our men disguised as sanatorium guards saw the housemaster Shiroky (come on!) who was hanging around the gates! And? - The housemaster asked for a way to put a child in care, while our man behind the walls made a run, carrying a metal box for organs, and the guard carelessly showed his machine gun under his coat. I think one of these days they will make an assault and then we will take them! Cool! Sure! I don't like it. I've been there today. The camp seems strange. We should hold back! I feel we really shouldn't. Are we being fooled? No, not any more. They stopped. Have a look. See? They must have been doing a wild goose chase and now they dropped it. We should hold back anyway. Well, you must be right. Come on, guys, bed time. Look here! They should get some consulting. And what do you plan for Shiroky, he seems not a bad guy. Dad, come on! Dad, are you going to kill them? Dad! Dad, come on! - Kirush! Kirush, darling. They are murderers. They are! And they can't change it. They are young now. The oldest one is what? Barely 14! They would go to a colony and then what? They would be superheroes there! They would make a gang beyond proportions! When they would come out they would be of age and trained by that Shiroky man beyond the police skills! How will we cope then? I know it's hard, Kiryusha. I know. There is no other way. Well, Ilya, where we go now? - Let me have a look. Yes. Let's go. Is it far? One and a half kilometre. Then we turn right and walk another half kilometre. I see. We stop within 50 meters. I go check things out and you stay and hide. And then we will work from there. You lot, on board. Hand over the knives. We are on an excursion. The 19th century architecture in this city. We went already. What a surprise! Could I ask comrade headmaster for this bus to fetch you idiots on the loose putting your heads in places? In short, tomorrow I will check them once more, to try to find out what's up. Though in my heart... Here they are. Stop! Stop! Get away now! I'm the boy in the clip. My father is an investigator. He set you up. Go away! Get in! Now straight and the next turn right! The road joins the highway. I see. I was trying to help you. I thought you'd better be caught and have a normal life again. But then I heard the plan was to kill you. I'm here since early to stop you. How did you know it was us? Just a bus with some kids. No buses go here, nothing to go to. The camp is a fake. I saw a bus and knew it was you. Attention! Everybody in the bus come outside with your hands held high. Otherwise we open fire without further notice. My Dad is with them, shall I go talk? - Go, you may stay alive. What about you? - We are beyond any talks. Then I stay. - Hear what I say. On my command you all go out of the bus into the forest and move North-West. If they chase you, hide the way I taught you. No buses or trains! Go by foot to the city and spread to railway stations, market places, all the street kids' kind of places. Disperse. Let's hope there'll be no hounds. Hold tight, tighter. Into the forest! Go! What are you waiting for, into the forest! Catch them! Watch it! This vehicle is public property. - Where are they? Where do they run, now? I would say, home. They are kids after all. What's next, comrade colonel? Search the children's home. If they show up, do as ordered. Look for evidence. Weapons, ammunition. And also their personal possessions or bed sheets, so our hounds can pick up the trail. - Can they? Go. I take this to 38th. Keep on sweeping the forest. Block every bus stop and railway platform. This one we bring along for proper interrogation. Now go. Where are their possessions? Where are their possessions? Beds, bed stands? Can you speak? This must be wrong. It can't be them. It's a lie. A mistake. Should I beg? What do you mean: no possessions, I don't understand. I see. Well it's up to you. Go! Well colonel: you wonder where their things are? No dog-sniffing stuff? So the kids are silent. True to their friends. - Take it easy, we'll be friendly. Just tell me where your Babies went. Care for a drink? For a good talk, I carry this around like a wine junky. You lot are turning me into one. Well you'd never guess, but we are in no hurry. Your Babies will be found anyway, and you know it. Help yourself. If it's not below you to use my glass. May I? - We can hand you a machine gun as well, can't we? Or do we better drive a tank here? You will manage a drink with handcuffs on. Well, OK. Do you have to search for them? It's our adult business. You got me, don't you? Everything can be blamed on me. I will sign everything. What else can you wish for. And they... They will be good boys now. Well, if we all walk out to the city square, get down on our knees... and say we are sorry. You good people, be our judges, then your Babies may be at ease... and others, too. No sooner than that. Look here. You know we'll be there soon facing His questions. Too late to be sorry? Too late. No pardon for us up there, nor here. And rightly so. I see. OK. They are in the former Prince Alsufievs' Hall. Block the Hall. Right? Call for re-enforcement. No assault before I arrive. Go! Let's go! We leave! They're going to kill our guys, aren't they? Take comrade colonel to the cell. One moment please. Well, what do you think kept me? I had to hear the report. I knew you'd be the first to hear. Now I have to go. - I don't get it? Guys, don't you fire your guns lest you hurt each other. And I'll be accurate. Gentle. Hey, stand still! Cut it, guys, why do you do it? I asked you nicely. Hand it over! This is not the way to keep arms. Found it? Do you ever clean the rust? Where are the keys for my cuffs? Here! Take it easy. Uncle Vadya will help us. He can show them! - I think they arrested him. Whom, Uncle Vadya? Sure! And what are you doing? Sending word to all the guys what's going on. They should know. Attention! We offer you to surrender. Come outside with you hands up and unarmed. We guarantee that you'll live! They lie! Don't believe them, they're going to kill you, those are their orders! Then leave! Why share our fate? Nope. You said so, they're out to kill. Leave! I won't. It's all because of me. No. Shit, some one's getting in here. A pro-hacker indeed, tracing us like that. (Coming. Wait. Hold on) The last thing we need. ALEKSEY79: Coming. Wait. Hold on. Don't! Machine guns, commandos, too dangerous, We never hurt one of ours. Have long lives, guys. A good machine-gun. The car will come in handy. And this is where you lot will go, to be nicely locked away. I better hurt no one. OK! They are there, are they? - Yes Sir What are we waiting for? Make the assault! Fire for effect, come on, go! Come on, go! Stop! Stop! Don't shoot! - Kira, don't! - Stop! Wait a mom- Kira? Kira! Kirochka! Kirochka, why? Why are you here? Kiryusha! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Kiryusha! Sonny! My darling! My darling son! Get a doctor! Somebody help! A moment, Kirochka! Take it easy, Dad is here! Somebody help! Kiryusha, one moment. I am calling an ambulance. Ambulance? Ambulance? Who did it? Who? Who? Vitya, don't! - Who? Vitya, don't! - Who? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Come outside! Throw down your weapons! We can sort it out! Come outside with your hands up! You will live! You wish! Think about it! If you don't surrender we will attack again! Comrade Colonel. One investigator is killed. And his son. When it's a fight, it's OK to liquidate... What is our excuse? What do you suggest? The assault, it will cover everything. All problems solved. We will wait. I promised! This is my last offer! Come outside with your hands up! If you don't surrender we will attack again! I don't feel like surrender. We started all this mess. We can't just shy away! It's awkward. It's no use. Come on, let's go. There is Uncle Vadya! I told you so! He is good! Vanya? - Uncle Vadya is calling! You are blocked! You won't break through! Come outside with your hands up! Time to give up, guys! - We won't do it, Uncle Vadya! We are sorry, we can't! You will be under my cover, they won't hurt you! Vanya! Give up! They'll kill you all, Vanya! Uncle Vadya! Retreat! They went for the bell tower! I can hold them as long as I have cartridges! It's an order! He is dead. They killed Uncle Vadya! This is my last offer! Come outside with your hands up! Enough of this killing! You are the murderers here. We are people's champions and always will be. Go, assault! Fire at my command. A mist is spreading over the field. It holds the earth in his arms. A mother is singing softly over her son like her sorrow: Sleep, little one. Sweet dreams, my darling, so close your eyes. Sleep, for I have suckled you in this age of horror. You will be lullabied by a lonely wind. Carried away in the black and white night. Go to sleep. Let the evil raven of life fly by. Then wake up to see no world around you.
