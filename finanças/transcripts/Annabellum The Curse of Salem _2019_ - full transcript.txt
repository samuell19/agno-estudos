Hello? What are you doing, Elizabeth? I am not Elizabeth. Lord, protect me from this evil. Our father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Sylvia ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Father. Oh, you are very welcome, Sylvia. Thompson, Sylvia's present, please. Now this is a very special present, my darling, very old, and all the way from America. It has been on a very long journey just for you. Happy birthday, Sylvia. Happy birthday, Sylvia. Mommy, Daddy, it's lovely. He needs to be punished. He needs to die. Sylvia! Lift them and cut your throat, my dearie. What in God's name just happened? I'm so sorry, Chris, but practical jokes have never been my forte. Caught me unawares there. I'm in early this morning, you see, lots of work to do. Oh. What are you working on at the moment, Mr. Whittaker? I'm working on a new display about the Warwick fusiliers, which is a very interesting... Hi, you all right, David? Morning, Chris. Better do my last rounds, Mr. Whittaker. I like to get out before the school kids arrive at the museum. I like to get to my office before the very same. Label the keys, David, label the bloody keys. This doll was found in the personal possessions of Corporal J. Bradshaw, soldier of the Warwick fusiliers, 1692. I regret-- Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, you know I don't like those mobile things, they're just a fad. How's Dad? No, I am listening. No, no, no, of course not, I haven't forgotten. They're staying the weekend, yeah. What time are they around tomorrow? I mean tonight. This afternoon, no, it's not a problem. It had only slipped my mind briefly. Yes, yes, I am listening. No, that's fine. Just drop them by the museum, say 4:30? I'll see you then. Bye. Right, I'm going for a cup of tea, and you are going straight to Steph's office. Mm. That'll be great. Yeah. Thank you. Mm. Yeah. All right, thanks. Bye, bye. Hello? Hello? Hello, David. This doll, where did you get it from? It was actually in the fusiliers archive room, hidden inside some archive boxes. It's a great find, David, great find. I'm glad you like it. I do, David. I do like her. Oh and by the way, I'm in tomorrow doing some more work on the fusiliers display, and I'll be bringing in my niece and nephew with me. Strange. Evening, Chris, good day? Just beginning really, you? Nearly done here. Back in tomorrow, though. But we're closed tomorrow. For you, maybe. I'm in in the afternoon. You got a couple of visitors waiting for you. Oh yes, of course. Where's the mum? Oh, she left them with me outside as we were walking in. Seems in a bit of a rush. Thanks. Hey, ugly butts. Hm? What are you doing here? You both look like you're in detention. Come on. Do you wanna see some cool stuff? Come on. Lady. Right, kids. Now you two are very, very lucky. Apart from your good Uncle David here, and security guard Christopher, you are the only two left in the museum. Now I've got about 15 minutes of work left to do, hm? So how about you run around the museum and investigate it, and see what you can see, eh? Back in one five minutes, okay? Oh, this is too heavy. This is very heavy. Try this one on, that's heavier. Oh, this one's nice. This is crazy. Look at this. Oh, that's cool. What about that? My god. This is a cool hat. John. Beth. Uncle David. Uncle David. Uncle David. Someone wants to say hello. Have you seen the kids anywhere? There's one of them. Where's your sister? I didn't know you were still here, Steph. Looking after your wonderful find. Come on then, Beth. Would you like a lift, or are you sorted? No, I'm fine. Making sure Anne is settled in, and then I need to run a few errands in town. I'll walk. Okay then, Steph, have a lovely weekend. Goodbye, Chris. Bye, Mr. Whittaker, bye, kids. You okay to lock the door behind you when you leave, Stephanie? I've got to go and start my rounds. Okay, thanks, I'll see you Monday. Bye, Chris. Hey, hey, kids, kids! Got a storm coming, just get inside. Chris. Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! Dead. Chris! Corporal J. Bradshaw, what have we got here? The fuck? Chris. Boo! Got you again. Chris. The hell? Chris. Chris. Die. Fuck. Jesus Christ. John, Beth, let's go. Okay. This doll was found in the personal possessions of Corporal J. Bradshaw, soldier of the Warwick fusiliers, 1692. I regret with all my heart giving the doll to my daughter Sylvia. For it was my daughter's birthday. I had, in my innocence, decided to give the doll as a birthday gift to my darling Sylvia. Not long after the doll was given to my daughter, we noticed a strangeness in her. But it was at night when the true evil came out. And cut your throat. It grasped at my daughter's soul and changed her to the most violent of beings. Sylvia! Within the journal lie the secrets of how this evil came to be. For make no mistake, this doll is evil in its purest form. Okay, all right. I need to go upstairs to my office. There's a book up there that'll help us with this. David. It's okay, Beth, Uncle David will get help, and you can stay here with me, where it's safe. But it's not okay. Now she's out. Who's out? Who's out, sweetheart? Be careful, Uncle David, she doesn't like people too much. David. I'll be back before you know it, okay? Okay, John? Okay. Okay, Uncle David. David. With God's good grace, we arrived in Massachusetts in late summer of 1691, following nine weeks at sea. I thank the lord to be back on land. The barracks are a welcome home, the local alehouse moreso. Chirping merry! We drill, we prepare. We prepare for whatever mission our king requests of us. My brothers of the sword and I have been ordered to a town named Salem. Marched for two days in the midst of a bitterly cold winter. We arrived gutfoundered and in need of warmth. As we marched through Salem's streets, our already chilled bones were greeted by a cold that seemed to eat into our very souls. My brethren and I noticed its touch. A town full of fear. A town where peace had long since left. We all pray to God for his divine blessing and help. Accusations of witchcraft. The judgment of God was set up through trials, to hear and determine the truth. But we see none. In its stead, neighbor pits against neighbor. Suspicion and hate grow, its fruit hanging from the trees, lifeless corpses for all to see. I swear 'tis not God, but Lucifer himself who dances down these streets. The accusations were started at the testimony of a few young women. Elizabeth Hubbard primarily. She and her friends took to convulsing and body shakes. Soon after, more were seized by this ill spirit. There could be no explanation of these maladies to the townsfolk but witchcraft. I was present at a good number of trials. A good few were found guilty and condemned to death by hanging. Is God's justice here for these judgements, I wonder? A dark fear has infected the town of Salem. It grows, the air tastes of it. I feel the lord is distant. Anne, a fair woman of older years. Anne was a midwife in Salem for most of her life, and had helped many of the townsfolk into the world. She gave toy soldiers to every boy, and a doll to every girl. I find it difficult to believe that a kindly woman such an Anne could be a witch. Uncle David has been a long time. You all know me. Anne of Salem. A little girl was I when we founded our town, and named it from the Bible word meaning peace. You hypocrites! You speak of God, of love, and of peace! Peace? For years I have shown you only love and kindness, and this is how you repay me. I curse you all, and all of Salem! The peace we named this town after is gone. I now increase your hatred, and turn you against your loved ones. Bellum omnium contra omnes! The war of all against all. Mark my grave not Anne of Salem, but Anne of Bellum! Not one day has passed since Annabellum's hanging, and we have been sent to arrest Elizabeth Hubbard. She had most brutally murdered those in her home. A cross down her own father's throat. Beth has been put in an asylum for her brutality. She had tremendous strength, unnatural it was. The house is to be burned. We all took some possessions before its purge. I took some small trinkets and a doll for my niece. We are leaving Bellum, Salem, glad to be so. On the way back, strange things, odd thoughts enter my mind. Thoughts of violence. Jacob. A voice, a voice I remember from the trials. It tells me to kill, but I... Not long after this entry, Corporal Jacob Bradshaw was arrested after he brutally murdered fellow soldiers. Soldiers he had known and lived alongside for many years. His trial was brief. I managed to investigate the case. He denied murder and declared that he was under the curse of Annabellum. The judge had him hanged. His belongings were sent home to England. They lay undisturbed for 172 years, until I found them, and gave the doll as a gift to Sylvia. I realize now that Corporal Bradshaw, like Elizabeth Hubbard, was not guilty of murder. They both did the bidding of the doll, which contained the evil spirit of Anne of Bellum. She's coming for him. God love it, Steph. For the love of God, no! Why are you doing this? God, for the love of, no! No, no! No! What the fuck, no, no! No, for fucks sake! No, no! No! Bellum omnium contra omnes. Get the scissors. I'm done with you, Stephanie. Lift them and cut your throat, my dearest. Beth. Beth? Beth, are you okay? Beth. John. Do you wanna play hide and seek? You hide, I'll seek. Go and get the journal, my lovely. Okay, I'll put the journal in my bag, then I'll go find him. Good girl. Let's find John. John's naughty, Beth. John. John. Hey Jim. Mike. Two? Four victims. Any survivors? One, a little girl named Beth. She says that Stephanie Ross here killed her uncle, David Whittaker, her brother, and the security guard. Shit. Any previous with this Stephanie? That's the thing, absolutely nothing. Motivation of any kind? Not yet. And is the girl hurt? Not a scratch. Jesus. Have you checked the CCTV? I have, the tape has gone. Where's the girl now? She's in the back with Kathy. Could you get a car around front please, Kathy? Hey Beth. I'm gonna walk you to the car, and that nice police lady Kathy is gonna take you to your mummy and daddy, okay? Tell him to get the bag. Can I have my bag please? Sure thing. Hello, love. Any news on how John and David died? Nothing on John or your brother. How's Beth holding up? She's in bed, sleeping. Good, good, she needs it. I'm just going to pop up quietly and make sure she's okay. Don't wake her, Peter. I won't, I won't. Daddy. Yes, my sweetheart. Somebody wants to say hello to you.
