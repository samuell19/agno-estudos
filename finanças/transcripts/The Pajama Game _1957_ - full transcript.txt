I consider Sleeptite pajamas a quality product, Mr. Hasler... ...something I'd be proud to be connected with. You would, huh? Well, might as well give you a trial. I've tried the old ones, I might as well try the young ones. Gladys. - It isn't easy, I'm warning you. - I'm not looking for an easy job. - Seven and a half cents. - I beg your pardon? Seven and a half cents. That's what they want now. I know what's going on here. I've just written the board of directors. It's absolutely unnecessary. - Gladys. - Yes, Mr. Hasler? This is Mr. Sorokin. The new superintendent. - Get him started. - Certainly. Will you come this way? Miss Hotchkiss. Well, Gladys, I suppose you're starting something with him now.

Seconds are ticking. can't waste time. can't waste time. When will old man Hasler break down And come up with our 7- and-a-half-cent raise? I can't even buy me a wreck Of a secondhand car On that salary he pays What do you think Of the new superintendent? - He's cute. - He'll never last. He's kind of fresh For a new superintendent - I like a man with spunk. - You like a man, period. All right, cut the laughing. Cut out the laughing, hurry up. Tempus fugit, tempus fugit. Waste, waste, waste. Hurry up.

"I'll fix it," he says. Oh, give him a chance, boys. He's only been here two days. - Sid? - Yeah? Pull me out. - Mr. Hasler wants you. - Again? Give me a screwdriver. I'm nearly done. - I'll tell him you're awfuI busy. - Thanks. You know how much they're paying at the packing plant? - A dollar three up. - Screwdriver. You know something else? They're paying $ 1. 14 up at the casket company. My gosh, you'd be a sensation up at the casket company. You could get a job up there as a tester... ...and just lie in coffins all day long. - Now hurry up. - I'm hurrying. - Well, hurry faster. - Hey. - Hey, you can't do that to me. - I can't? I just did. Well, I'll fix you. - I'm getting the grievance committee. - Go. It'll give you something to do. I don't have to take that stuff off nobody. Go away, boy. You bother me. I'll show you. And on my weak arm too. That grievance committee can start quite a rhubarb. This whole town is a rhubarb. - Oh, you'll get used to it. - I sure intend to. Hey, you. Go down to the storeroom, get me a switch and a piece of cable. Move. Oh, Mr. Sorokin, I told you to be carefuI. When I heard about you beating up that boy- I didn't beat him up. Well, he's dangling his arm like it hurt something terrible. - Here comes Babe Williams. - Be delighted to talk to him. All right, mister, here's Babe Williams. So this is the committee. That's right, Mr. Sorokin. This is the committee. Charlie, this grievance committee is different. - Never mind the snow job. - Oh, sorry. All right, I shoved the kid. What's the next move? - He says you hit him. - No, I just- - Look, Miss Wilson, I've got- - Miss Williams. - What's the difference? - I'm sorry. - He ought to know the right name. - Mae, will you take it easy. Mr. Sorokin, I've got quite a few problems of my own right now. - This helper says you socked him. - He does? Let's say I shoved him. It sounds more refined. You are not supposed to strike an employee. We have rules about that. For both sides, I hope. Listen, miss, I'll spread it on the table. This young man needs vocational guidance. - Think so? - He wants to be a bank president. I don't see what all this has to do with it. You don't seem to have made a good impression on the new superintendent. He ain't got no right to shove me around, especially on my weak arm. Listen, miss, I've gotta get this factory going. - can't we take this up later? - Of course we can, Mr. Sorokin. That's in the rulebook too. Have the nurse check you and send me a report. can't shove me around. It was broke once already. Thanks for your cooperation, Miss Williams. - It's all in the rulebook. - I must read that sometime. You certainly should. AII I have to say is, you're the cutest committee I've ever had to deal with. - Oh, that's what I want. - What's going on now? come on, girls, let's pull together. This is a crisis. The tops are 15 minutes behind the bottoms. can't waste time. Hurry up. Hurry up. When you're racing with the clock When you're racing with the clock And the second hand Doesn't understand That your back may break And your fingers ache And your constitution Isn't made of rock It's a losing race When you're racing... I never know what to wear to a picnic. If you got the style, it don't matter. You elected me president. You gotta have confidence in me. - AII I says is that we were wasting- - No time to talk ultimatums and strikes. - But that 7 and a half cents. - Wait a minute. No question we're gonna get that 7-and-a-half-cent raise. Other companies are paying it and we're entitled. But we gotta be smart. Wait till Hasler's got so many orders in he can't afford to close the factory. Then we got him. What about that helper yesterday? Says the super socked him. - I didn't get no report on that. - Oh, that's one for the birds. - Why, he hasn't even got a bruise. - No? No. The nurse says he's a faker. I guess maybe that's right. - Sure, he's a phony. - Okay. Why, if that Sorokin guy had really hit him, he'd break him in two. Mr. Sorokin is so strong. He's so wonderfuI. - What's this? - The new super. I think he's simply... don't you? - I didn't notice. - I noticed. I thought Babe was noticing too. She lit up. You know, you girls are really- Love comes at last to Babe Williams. Will you get off it? I hardly looked at the man. I'm the grievance committee. Love? Are you nuts? Some people can't tell when it hits them. All you gotta do is say hello to a man And they've got you Whispering in his ear All you gotta do it seems Is work for him And they've got you goin ' Berserk for him If there's a guy You merely have a beer with They've got you Setting the wedding date It seems they've just Gotta have some dirt To bend your ear with So before you start I herewith state I'm not at all in love Not at all in love, not I Not a bit Not a mite Though I'll admit He's quite a hunk of guy He's not my cup of tea Not my cup of tea, not he Not an ounce Not a pinch He's just an inch Too sure of himself for me Well, of course, you've noticed His manly physique And that look in his eye Say, I'm sure he can cut Most any man down to size He must be as fierce as a tiger When he's mad And I'll bet he cries like a little boy When he's sad But I'm not at all in love Not at all in love, not I Not a straw Not a hair I don't care If he's as strong as a lion Or if he has the rest of you sighin ' You may be sold But this girl ain't buyin ' I'm not at all in love She's not at all in love Not at all in love, oh, no Not a pin Not a crumb Must be the summer heat That gives her that glow 'Cause she's not at all in love Not at all in love, she cries Not a snip Not a bite Must be the light from the ceiling Shining there in her eyes He's young and handsome and smart And we can't get over it But this lady's heart He doesn't affect a bit It's easy to see that her daffy grin Is the grin she always wears And she's breathless Because she ran up a flight of stairs - Obviously - Naturally Definitely - Excuse me. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. - Obviously. - Naturally. Definitely. She's not at all in love Not at all in love, not she No, I'm not Not a dot Not a touch No, not much When I fall in love There'll be no doubt about it 'Cause you will know From the way that I shout it You're shouting. I haven't fallen She hasn't fallen - I'm not at all in love - She's not at all in love Superintendent's office. Come in. Oh, yes, Sid. Dolores Paradisso, that's her name. Well, she's supposed to be very elegant. She can sew a button on a fly... ...like she was pouring tea for the Queen of England. Oh, yeah. She can pull hair all right. - Them girls had another fight. - Wanna buy a ticket for the picnic? Might as well and get it over with. One dollar and all the beer you can guzzle. No beer for me. Gives me heartburn something awfuI. - Yeah, me too. - Oh, you. - Here. - Thanks. You gonna do your knife-throwing act? I suppose so. There always seems to be a demand for it. Was you honest on the real stage? That's where I first met him, Poopsie. He was throwing knives at a woman at the Majestic Theater. It's gonna be some picnic. I saw you. Leaving him a note, huh? - Carrying on with Sorokin. - Oh, Vernon. I saw you put that note on his desk. I'm not blind. And that's why you wore that low-necked dress to work today. You make me scream, Vernon. - You just make me scream. - Okay, then what's in it? - I dare you to tell me what's in it. - Read it, then go cut your throat. "Okay payroll. $ 7502.01. " That means "I love you" in the Morse code. Ain't you ashamed of yourself, Hinesie? Now that we've got that all settled... ...do you think you could trust me as far as the ladies' room? I'll never be jealous again, Gladys. I promise. Maybe I'll give you cause someday. Hinesie. Hinesie. I've learnt my lesson. I'll never be jealous again. - You stick to that now. - Absolutely. That's easier said than done - I can do it - I knew it But let's take an example Just for fun Picture this You're waiting three hours For her to come home from a date There I am, I'm waiting three hours For her to come home from a date Here she comes Her lipstick is smeared And she can't seem to walk Very straight Here she comes Her lipstick is smeared And she can't seem to walk Very straight Then she drops a bottle of rye And not battin ' an eye Says a train wreck made her late Well, Hinesie, what would you do then? I would trust her I would trust her By George, I swear I would trust her No, I'll never be jealous again - Nice work. - I know what I'm doing, Mabel. - Now let's take another example. - Sure, Mabel. Picture this, you've nothin ' to do So you drop in to chat for a while There I am with nothin ' to do So I drop in to chat for a while Something's up, the window is open And Gladys is forcin ' a smile Somethin's up, the window is open And Gladys is forcin ' a smile Then you see a hat and a tie And a pair of socks In a nice, neat little pile Well, Hinesie? I would trust her I would trust her By George, I swear I would trust her No, I'll never be jealous I'll never, never, never, never, never Never be jealous again That's the stuff, you're practically cured. There will be no more Nightmares to sleep through No more keyholes to peep through No more bushes to creep through That's my plan Well, now that you're a new man Picture this You go to your sweetie's apartment You borrowed the keys There I am I go to my sweetie's apartment I borrowed the keys There she is She's giving a sailor A very affectionate squeeze There she is She's giving a sailor A very affectionate squeeze Then to boot She tells you She was in the arms of her cousin Who's back from overseas Her cousin. You expect me to believe that? Hinesie. I would trust her I would trust her By George, I swear I would trust her No, I'll never be jealous I'll never, never, never, never, never Never, never, never, never, never - Never be jealous again - Good. Hinesie. Hinesie, stop it. Stop it. Hinesie, stop it. What will Mr. Hasler say? Have you gone crazy? Hinesie, stop it. Hinesie, stop it. This is terrible. Memo: Cutting foreman. Too many rejects on rayon crepe numbers. What right has the union to run their Pepsi-Cola machine with our electricity? Well, what's this? This shouldn't be Iying around. - Gladys. - Yes? - This book. - Oh, you scared the life out of me. It's all right. I've got the key around my neck. I don't want it left Iying around. - Is that clear? - Yes, Mr. Hasler. If I can't trust Gladys, who can I trust? What was my book doing up here anyhow? The old man's got a bad case of "bookitis," hasn't he? - Yes. - I wonder if he's got... ...a skeleton locked in there. Say, Mabel, tell me something. What kind of a girI is this Babe Williams? - She's peppy. - I can see that. Full of life. - Give me Ladies' Pants. - Yes, Mr. Sorokin. - Hello? - Prez? Sorokin speaking. Whatever happened to that complaint from the helper? I'd like to get it settled. Would you send the grievance committee up to my office? - No, right away. - Okay, Sid. Thanks. I heard you had an eye for her. You hear things easy around this place. First thing you know they'll be talking about us. Don't think it hasn't been mentioned. Memo: Head cutter- Come in. Have a seat. Yes, Mr. Hasler, I'll be right there. The last six lots went over the estimate. Better check with your markers. I wanted to talk to you about that assault and battery case. - Well, we thought we would forget that. - That's a relief. The committee decided just to drop the matter. Well, I wanted to get it straight. For a while there I thought that you and I'd have to fight a duel. Seems that won't be necessary. As a matter of fact, we have been fighting a duel. Every time I come on your floor I try to get you to look at me, but I always lose. Never a look. Perhaps I'm just very interested in my work. Perhaps. But as far as that helper is concerned, we know that you had provocation. What I had to go through to get him to kick across with a screwdriver. I'd have been justified if I had socked him. Well, we won't go into that. But anyhow, we have it down in our books as a slight nudge. I think a little physical punishment is good for people once in a while. Oh, you do, Captain Bligh? No, not exactly. Sit down for a second, will you? I wanna talk to you. - How about a date? - What? How about going out to dinner some night? Well, I don't know, I... Maybe check up on some of the local hot spots? Thank you very much, Mr. Sorokin, but I don't think so. What is this strange power I have over women? But it wouldn't work, not at all. Looks like I struck out that time. Well, it's nothing personal. But you see, you're the superintendent, and I'm the grievance committee. Memo: Timekeeper. Be sure all girls fill out credit cards properly and check... Memo: To Sid Sorokin. Hey, there You with the stars in your eyes Love never made a fool of you You used to be too wise Hey, there You on that high-flyin ' cloud Though she won't throw A crumb to you You think someday She'll come to you Better forget her Her with her nose in the air She has you dancin ' on a string Break it and she won't care Will you take this advice I hand you Like a brother? Or are you not seein ' things Too clear? Are you just too far gone to hear? Is it all goin ' in one ear And out the other? Hey, there You with the stars in your eyes Who, me? Love never made a fool of you Not untiI now. You used to be too wise Yeah, I was. Once. Hey, there I hear you. You on that high flyin ' cloud Though she won't throw A crumb to you Don't rub it in. You think someday She'll come to you Oh, shut up. Better forget her Forget her Her with her nose in the air Her with her nose in the air She has you dancing on a string A puppet on a string Break it and she won't care She won't care for me Will you take this advice I hand you Like a brother? Or are you not seein ' things Too clear? Are you too much in love to hear? Is it all goin ' in one ear And out the other? - What a day, eh, Prez? - Yeah, solid gold. I love these picnics. Always come back from the road for them. Say, on this last trip I sold a lot of Sleeptite pajamas, believe me. - Oh, you did, eh? - I knocked them for a loop in Masalon... ...Chilicarty, Van Worth, Napoleon. Finest season I ever had, girls. I'll have to announce that there ain't gonna be enough baked beans... ...but there's plenty of potato salad. So them that don't care for beans can go heavy on the salad and vice versa. I can never remember a time when competition was so ruthless... ...dealers so cantankerous, costs outrageous... ...and profit margins sunk so low. My good friends, pajamas are at the crossroads. Well, if it isn't the grievance committee. - Should've run faster. - I have a grievance. There's a new fella here named Sid Sorokin. Knocking himself out to be a dandy fellow but he can't make a score. Well, you just tell Mr. Sorokin that Miss Williams is a very cold, hard-boiled doll. He wouldn't like her at all. This way for the knife throwing. Oh, there's the knife throwing. This I gotta see. This way for the great knife-throwing exhibition. - What happened to you? - Stay out in the open. - Don't get down in them woods. - Hurry, hurry, hurry. Make way for the old professor. Let me place my knives. Hurry, hurry, hurry, for a riot of thrills. Introducing Professor Vernon Hines, master of the flying blades... ...in his sensational demonstration of iron nerve and skill. - Is the trained nurse in attendance? - The nurse is here. I'm ready. I beg your forbearance. I'm out of practice. One, two... Hey, Hinesie, put one here. - Look out. - That's a crazy girI. Now if some young lady from the audience... ...will stand in front of the board... ...I'll show the act as it should be. - My mother loves me. - Come on, Mae, you do it. - No, don't. - You're so big he can't miss. Now cut that out. Behave yourself. Eleven years and never drew a drop of blood. - I'll do it. - Don't get foolish. I'll do it. Can you knock the apple off my head, Hinesie? That's the spirit, Babe. You show them, kid. - I don't think she should. - Please, Babe, don't. One, two... - Where's my apple? - I think that's enough. Give it to me. Hinesie, you're making us all frightened. You frightened, how do you think I feel? Come on, Hinesie. Shoot. Well, now will you just hold perfectly still? - Oh, no. - She's shaking. Goodness, she's shaking. - Something awfuI's gonna happen. - You better not, Babe. All right, everybody, will you hold still? One, two... Is it over? Now break it up. Get that stuff out of here now. Break it up. Hey, that's an insult. My skill has never been questioned before. Go drown yourself. Break it up, all of you, break it up. My, but you're an impetuous girI. Where you going, Mae? No place special. I tell you I'm not jealous. I didn't say you were jealous, I said you were drunk. Well, you can't have everything. That defiant policy is gonna get you in trouble some day, Catherine Williams. It's been working out so far. Look, I've got a new policy in mind for both you and me. Let's quit fighting. What fight? Come here, Catherine. The new policy. Gee, Babe, you're terrific. You're not so bad yourself. For a superintendent. Listen, I'm not the superintendent. What did you do, resign? Today I'm just Sid, you're just Babe. A guy and his girI. Sid, just because I kissed you, does that make me your girI? Well, anyway, the feud is over. This picnic is going to be okay. - Can you polka? - Of course not. Come on. Don't you wanna be my girI? - Why don't you answer my question? - Do I have to? Absolutely. Now is the historic moment. How about it? Do you like me? Of course I do, you silly thing. You do? Holy smoke, what a picnic. What a girI. What a day. Put me down. This is my once a year day Once a year day Felt the mornin ' sun I knew that This was my once a year day Once a year day Even got a kiss from you I feel like hoppin ' up and down Like a kangaroo Jumpin ' fences, climbin ' trees What pleases me is what I'll do 'Cause this is our once a year day Once a year day Everyone's entitled to be wild Be a child, be a goof Raise the roof Once a year This is our once a year day Once a year day Once a year we're jumpin ' fences This is our once a year day Once a year day Once a year we lose our senses Look at Charlie by the barn Kissin ' Katie's ear Charlie's wife is fightin ' mad I'm glad it's only once a year Look at Papa Halterbush Claims he's 93 Actin ' like he's 22 He's chasin ' Sadie up a tree 'Cause this is his once a year day Once a year day Everyone's entitled to be wild Be a child, be a goof Raise the roof Once a year No. This is our once a year day Once a year day Everyone's entitled to be wild When you first come here after that picnic last week, Katie says to me: "Don't be a pest. Don't talk too darn much. " Might be a lot worse if I didn't talk at all, eh, Sid? You're right. I always says a railroad man can't be too much of a doggone pest... ...because he ain't home enough. - You go on your run tonight, don't you? - Yes, off to Milwaukee, doggone it. Say, Sid, here's something you don't see every day. - What is it? - A petrified bat. Oh, Pop. Sid is not interested in petrified bats. What the heck, dear, I didn't say he was. Yeah, I know you. The tyranny of women. Well, I'm gonna get my things. Old number 15 waits for no man. Pop belt your ears off? He's a great guy. I like him. But I like you better. No, no, no. Wait till Pop goes out. - Say, Sid, do you like stamps? - Oh, Pop. Even if he don't, that's something that'd interest anyone. Two sets of mint Columbians. Late blocks on every issue since 1919. Good night, Katie. - Night, Pop. - Come around anytime, Sid. I'd like to. Say, he has got a full set of mint Columbians. Sure, he has. That's why I work at Sleeptite. I feel good, Babe. Feel like home. - Wonder if we've got any onions. - Onions? Gonna make a western. You want one? That's my baby boy, she wants a western. No, honey. I do not want a western. Food is not uppermost in my thoughts at the moment. - I suppose you want some coffee too. - No, it'll keep me awake. Now cut that out. What's the matter, lover? I don't wanna talk small talk Now that I'm alone with you I don't wanna talk small talk We've got bigger things to do Let's not talk of the weather Or the fashions for the fall Why don't you stop All this small talk? I've got somethin ' better For your lips to do And that takes no talk At all I gotta buy me a dressy dress The one that I have is such a mess Small talk Who will you vote for next election? How do you like the stamp collection? Small talk Read in a book the other day That halibut spawn in early May And horses whinny and donkeys bray And furthermore The Pygmy tribes in Africa May have a war - No? - Yes. I don't wanna talk small talk What do you think They charge for fruit now? Now that I'm alone with you Got so a buck ain't worth a hoot now - I don't wanna talk small talk - Read where the winters Are getting milder - We've got bigger things to do - And that the teenage kids are wilder - Let's not talk of the weather - One of these days I'll paint the kitchen - Or the fashions for the fall - Get Pop to put a new light switch in Why don't you stop All this small talk? - Like I was saying... - I've got something better - What I mean is... - For you lips - I was only... - To do - Look out, I'm cooking. - You sure are. Babe... ...I love you. - Darling. - Sid... ...there's something we've got to talk about. - What? - I think you're wonderfuI, and I love you. But we're in for a lot of trouble. No, baby, why should we be? Because something's going to come between us. - Who? - It's not any "who. " Seven and a half cents. Oh, that. That contract, lover, that's important. Maybe we should face that- - Don't talk such nonsense. - Sid, you mustn't treat me like a baby. - I'm not, darling. - Then you've got to listen to me. I don't know why the union is so important to me, but it is. I guess you just gotta be on a team. So that's why, no matter what's with us, Sid... ...I'm gonna be fighting for my side and fighting hard. All right. How do you feel about me, Babe? I love you terribly. If we both feel the same way about each other, isn't that enough? Oh, you don't know me. Babe, I love you. If you can take it I can. I don't wanna talk small talk I've got somethin ' better For your lips to do And that takes no talk And that takes no talk - At all - At all Babe, are you happy? I'm not even touching the ground. It's good, isn't it? So good I can hardly believe it. Tell me. - Again? - Tell me. - I love you. - Tell me. I love you more than all the heroes in all the history books in the world. - Tell me. - What a woman. I'll tell you. There once was a man Who loved a woman She was the one he slew a dragon for They say that nobody ever Loved as much as he But me, I love you more - Tell me. - And there once was a man Who loved a woman She was the one He gave his kingdom for They say that nobody ever Loved as much as he But me, I love you more My love is a giant, fierce and defiant But how can I prove it to you? Ain't got no kingdom, no dragon To back up my braggin ' How can I show what I would do? I only know there once was a man Who loved a woman She was the one he ate that apple for They say that nobody ever Loved as much as he But me, I love you more Tell me. There once was a woman Who loved a man He was the one That she took poison for They say that nobody ever Loved as much as she But me, I love you more There once was a woman Who loved a man He was the one She swam the channel for They say that nobody ever Loved as much as she But me, I love you more My love's meteoric It's merely historic A whirlwind, a cyclone on wheels It rocks the whole solar plexus It's bigger 'n Texas I just can't tell you how it feels I only know there once was a woman Who loved a man Loved him enough To cause the Trojan War They say that nobody ever Loved as much as she But me, I love you more An ' more, an ' more, an ' more - More than a hangman loves his rope - More than a dope fiend loves his dope - More than an Injun loves his scalps - More than a yodeler loves his Alps - More. - More. - There once was a man - There once was a woman - Who loved a woman - Who loved a man - She was the one he slew the dragon for - He was the one that she took poison for - They say nobody loved as much as she - They say nobody loved as much as he - But me, I love you more - But me, I love you more - But me - But me - I love you more - I love you more I wanna be fair. That's what I keep telling you. That's my whole principle of business. I want my relations with the union to be as pleasant as possible. The committee's in there talking to Mr. Hasler. Well, I'm steering clear of that. - I'll go get my lunch. - We ate already. Let's not adjourn with any hard feelings. We must preserve that fine Sleeptite spirit. That's easy to say, Mr. Hasler, but we're not getting anyplace. - We're going backwards. - I didn't say no. I said, not now. Look, Mr. Hasler, this thing has been dragging on for months. The help are getting jumpy. Their patience is about wore out. I wanna be fair. I'm gonna tell you the plain truth, Mr. Hasler. We know the company's doing one heck of a business. We don't have no education, but we got eyes and ears. Everybody in the industry has had a 7- and-a-half-cent raise but us. As I said, I wanna be fair. That's always been my policy. So I don't give you a yes and I don't give you a no. I say that we have to examine it and I have to talk to the board. That's just the way we're gonna leave it. Sure. Come on. I told you we wouldn't get no place. - Looks like another run around, Prez. - He's a fighter, he says. What a line. Well, what do we do now? - Slowdown. - Attaboy, this is it. You know what to do. Slowdown. Slowdown. Slowdown. You're in charge of this room, Babe. - I got you. - Go to it. Go to your places. Steam room. Something's wrong here. What's the matter? I guess I'm just overworked or something, Mr. Hines. Ever since lunch I just can't get the hang of it. Well, I think I get the hang of it. I'm gonna see the superintendent on what's going on around here. Hurry up Hurry up - Hurry up - Can't waste time - Hurry up - Can't waste time - When you're racing with the clock - Can't waste time - When you're racing with the clock - Hurry up - And the second hand - Hurry up - Doesn't understand - Hurry up That your back may break And your fingers ache And your constitution Isn't made of- All right, just a minute. Now listen to me. This is a nice show you're putting on here, but I don't like it. My job's to turn out goods and that's what we're gonna do. You have a contract. I didn't make it but it's there. I want a day's work for a day's pay. I can still hire and fire around here, you know. Now let's go. Somebody jammed the line. Who did that? I did. You're fired. I am? Yes. Well, that's just fine. I haven't had a vacation in three years. I need one. So long, girls. Get Charlie. We'll be operating again in 15 minutes. Now clear out till I call you back. I have a fuse and a switch. Boy, look out. Did you get burned? Yeah. Twice. What's going on down at the plant, you all know as good as I. And any members of the type I run into from time to time who say: "What good is a union? Why should I pay my dues?" Why, they could get a mighty good object lesson... ...from where would they be now in this battle for the 7 and a half cents... ...that they wouldn't get if it wasn't for the union. What's sure as shooting gonna get it. So leave us all remember... ...that our union should be first and foremost in our minds... ...next only to our loved ones and the tiny tots and kiddies. Now before we break up, we're gonna have a little entertainment... ...and I hope you're gonna show a special courtesy tonight. A couple of the cutting room boys is got up an act with Gladys Hotchkiss... ...who is from the front office. And if these good folk is good enough to come down here and do this act for us... ...why, the least you can do is not to sneak out the back way like last time. The little number they got worked up is something that's right on the nose... ...because it's about getting hot. And fellow union members... ...that's what we're doing. Getting hot. Where'd you get the hat? Quiet. Quiet. Shut up, everybody. Yeah I got steam heat I got steam heat I got steam heat But I need your love To keep away the cold I got steam heat I got steam heat I got steam heat But I can't get warm Without your hand to hold The radiator's hissin ' Still I need your kissin ' To keep me from freezin ' each night I got a hot water bottle But nothin ' I got'll take the place of you Holdin ' me tight I got steam heat I got steam heat I got steam heat But I need your love To keep away the cold They told me to shovel more coal In the boiler They told me to shovel more coal In the boiler They told me to shovel more coal In the boiler But that don't do no good They told me to pour some more oil In the burner They told me to pour some more oil In the burner They told me to pour some more oil In the burner But that don't do no good - Coal in the boiler - No good - Oil in the burner - No good - Cold? - No - Hot? - Yes Yes, yes, yes Come on, union, get hot But I need your love To keep away the cold I need your love To keep away The cold Yeah. Listen, Mae, pay attention to the meeting and quit guzzling all that free beer. I ain't guzzling, I'm just being sociable. Sure, Mae's got to keep her strength up. We can't just sit around here and do nothing. We gotta make plans. Hasler ain't gonna give in easy. - We got the slowdown. - I mean other things. More like, for instance... ...like, why, this suggestion I got here from Jake Fondermeyer. He says when he was working at the Ironclad Overall Company... ...and they was having trouble, why, they spit tobacco juice... ...in the back hip pockets of the overalls. I draw the line at chewing tobacco. I wasn't suggesting that. How about if the packers put the size large bottoms... ...with the size small tops? And like that? Sure. Now, that's what I mean. That's constructive. - Excuse me. - That's clear thinking. Hello. Sure. Sure, I recognize your voice. - But that won't take effect soon enough. - No, I suppose not. Yes, I am. Let's be practical. No, I can't talk now. I've been away three days and... I'm gonna break down and have another beer. Look, I have several people here. It wouldn't do any good anyway. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Babe. They were saying... Well, look, I don't wanna get Babe into trouble. What trouble can you get me into? I'm fired already. Well, the union ought to do something about that too. If she hadn't stood right up and said she did it, we could've. But if somebody up and admits they been busting the company property... Listen, here's a confidence just inside the committee. Some of the buttons ain't being sewed on so good. Wait till the salesmen come screaming back to Hasler. - Hello. - Hi, Mr. Williams. Oh, big meeting, huh? - Hiya, honey. - Hiya, Pop. Don't let me interrupt. Well, that's about it, anyhow. - Sure. - Okay. And let's be thinking of new ways to jam things up. All right. Let me take you home, huh, Mae? I don't mind. Well, I gotta step on it. - Can you give me a lift? - Sure, come on. You can drop me off at the drugstore. - Night, Babe. - Night. - And thanks for the beer. - Okay. Oh, don't be so nervous. That's what I like about picnics. They bring people together. They sure do. I never thought you was aware I was alive, untiI that day. How could I miss you? You're the kind that stands out in a crowd. Know what I mean? - I thought I told- - Have you really been away? Sure. I went to Chicago to visit the Lincoln Park Zoo. Just because we're on different sides, is that any reason... - ... for you and me to get all balled up? - Looks like it, doesn't it? Not to me, it doesn't. What kind of a queen are you anyway? Haven't you heard? I'm the sweetheart of Local 343... ...Amalgamated Shirt and Pajama Workers of America. My gosh, Sid, I warned you. I told you. You know? You knew all about how I felt. I happen to think there are certain things a person has to stand for in this life. But I guess you forgot about that. I forget nothing. They pay me to run a factory. So run the factory. You stick to your side and I'll stick to mine. Listen, Miss Williams. I love you. corny, ain't it? Did you hear me? Babe, can't you see my side of it? I can't faiI at this. I was a foreman when I bluffed my way into this job... ...and I'm gonna fight to stay here. Now that I've got you in my plans I'm fighting even harder. Watch those hands, tycoon. Well, here we are. Oh, hello, Sid. I thought I heard your voice. What you got there, Pop, your stamp album? Now don't get excited. Sid don't wanna look at it, he doesn't have to. There's no law against my looking at it, is there? Sid likes stamps, he told me so. But me, I'm just plain bushed, so if you don't mind I think I'll slide off to bed. Run along, honey. Good night, dear. Good night. Sleep well. Thanks. Sid... ...suppose we start with the Pan-American Exposition issue of 1901. I guess that's as good a place to start off as any. Hey, there You with the stars in your eyes Love never made a fool of you You used to be too wise Hey, there You on that high-flyin ' cloud Though you've been acting cold To him You know your heart Is sold to him Get on the ball, girl Just take it all in your stride Don't let him make you fall apart You've always had such pride Won't you take this advice I hand you like a brother Or are you not seein ' things Too clear? Are you too much In love... Hines, this is an emergency, come on. The whole country is on the skids. Here I am right now with employees openly defiant of top management. Look, Mr. Hasler, maybe if we offered a compromise. Not untiI there's ice in Hades three feet thick. I'm a fighter, Sorokin. We got hundreds of orders to get out. That's right, Mr. Hasler. Now here's this letter from Marx and Klein- Marx and Klein. Wholesalers. Doggone chain outfit. Doggone communists. Want another price cut, I suppose. - I been looking for you, Mr. Hasler. - Where'd you come from? - You look like a medium. I need you. - What on earth is going on around here? - Take your pants off. - I'll do no such thing. Mr. Hasler, this is life and death to the Sleeptite organization. - I want him to model these pajamas. - Hines, take your pants off. Okay, chief. - Me? Honest? - Come on. - Come on. - What a day. I'm a very busy man. I'm a time-study man, not a model. - This is all for Sleeptite, mister. - Hines, put those pajamas on. Hurry it up. Let's get it over with. Whatever it is. Mr. Hasler, I want you to get the picture. I'm showing Mr. charley Robertson of the Robertson Brothers. I ain't some type salesmen who believes in half measures. Whenever I have a sample room, I do what we got Hinesie doing. I model the pants myself. I don't- BeautifuI styling. What more do you want? Now wait. Here I am in Peoria, I'm modeling the pants. Mr. Robertson and his buyers are impressed with the line and ready to buy. - Get the picture? - Go on, go on. I hope there's some point to all this. Hines, take a deep breath. Stick out your stomach. This is truly ridiculous. Bear in mind I got these pajamas out of stock. Right out of the box. Go on, Hines, breathe. Take a big breath. He said to breathe. Breathe. Let's get it over with. My gosh. No, leave them lay. - What are you doing? Playing games? - Let me see those. They're all like that. Every one. Boxes and boxes of them. - Well, what's the idea? Who did this? - Somebody's got a sense of humor. What are you talking about? - Two threads in every waistband button. - What? They're not sewed on. Only two threads. - Somebody's being very cute. - Cute? Sabotage. Open rebellion. - On the other hand it may be just- - Oh, put your pants on. - Sorry, boss. - What did you do, Vernon? I didn't do anything. I'll be the laughing stock of the pajama game. What'd this Robertson do when your pants fell down? He laughed, Mabel. No sense of humor. Hold the orders till we check the stock. I'll be right down. - Come on, Max. - They think they can lick Myron Hasler... ...they got another guess coming. I'll go down and fire the whole factory. I'll naiI it up, board it down. And, Hines, I want an individual time report... ...on each individual worker. I don't care if they- - I got an individual... - Oh, no. My vice president. Partly your fault. Well, do something. Rip it. Tear it loose. Now, Mr. Hasler, in this letter from Marx and Klein- Don't bother me with letters from Marx and Klein or anybody. Gladys, don't forget the meeting of the board of directors tomorrow. Two threads. That's what I've got to tell them. Two threads. - We gotta recall an awfuI lot of orders. - How many? - They're gonna let us know. - Sabotage. - Mr. Hasler. - Yeah? - I'd like to make a pitch. - Pitch? All right, pitch ahead. Let me make my position clear. I'm for the company first, last and always. But labor problems have got to end up in one way. Compromise. Sorokin, you've been around here long enough to learn something. But you seem a little slow. - I'm a fighter. Keep your dukes up. - Yes, but- Don't waste your breath on me, keep your dukes up. Hey, cheer up. - Yeah. "Keep your dukes up. " - What? Mr. Hasler wants me to take boxing lessons. You certainly are a character. I'd like to get some information out of you too. What kind? Double entry. Well, you're not gonna get any information. So there. I'm a desperate man. I hate to ask a cute kid like you to do me a favor. Sid, dear, you wouldn't want me to violate a trust, would you? I sure would, if it'd help unsnarI things around here. Why is that so important? Because my future depends upon the titanic struggle for pajama survival. You're a scream. - And I just feel that if- - No, no. Not that. I wouldn't ask you to show it to me. Just leave it around. No. Besides, it's locked anyhow. I know a sexy dame who'd lend me the key. Oh, you think so? Well, it'd be fun trying to persuade her. It might be fun to have you try. - Well, I gotta go now. - No. Wait. For what? Let's go out tonight. Well, I hope you're not serious about that key. I don't feel like being serious about anything. You're busy, huh? No. I sure would like to. Oh, gee, where will you take me? Anyplace you say. I know a wonderfuI joint. I know a dark, secluded place A place where no one Knows your face A glass of wine A fast embrace It's called Hernando's Hideaway Ol? All you see are silhouettes And all you hear are castanets And no one cares how late it gets Not at Hernando's Hideaway Ol? At the Golden Fingerbowl Or anyplace you go You will meet your uncle Max And everyone you know Soon you are sitting close And making love to me You may take my heart You may take my soul But not my key Just knock three times And whisper low That you and I were sent by Joe Then strike a match And you will know You're in Hernando's Hideaway Ol? - Fresh. - Who's that? Poopsie. Poopsie. Poopsie. Hey, buddy, this ain't Poopsie. I know a dark secluded place A place Where no one knows your face A glass of wine A fast embrace It's called Hernando's Hideaway Ol? Joe sent us. Poopsie. Poopsie. At the Golden Fingerbowl Or anyplace you go You'll meet your uncle Max And everyone you know But if you go to the spot That I am thinkin ' of You will be free To gaze at me And talk of love Just knock three times And whisper low That you and I were sent by Joe Then strike a match And you will know You're in Hernando's Hideaway Ol? I wanna ask you a personal question, Sid. - Do you like Scotch? - No, Gladys, I don't like Scotch. Neither do I. Scotch has a very peculiar taste to it. Kind of a Scotch-like taste? Yeah, that's it. count me out. - Is that gin? - Yes, ma'am. You're right. You know, I can't figure you out, Sid. I guess when you first came here, you caught on I thought you were cute. But you never gave me a tumble till tonight. I told you what I was up to, didn't I? I forget. Tell me again. I'm gonna get you fried and get that key away from you. You'll never get my key. You'll never get my key. They'll hear you. You think I'm terrible, don't you? I'd be glad to take you home. No, I don't want you to, Prez. I just asked you to bring me here. - I gotta give someone a message. - Good evening, Miss Williams. - Shall I get you a table? - No. I'm looking for somebody. You're welcome. - Hiya, folks. - Howdy. - Hi, Babe. - Hello, Poopsie. I thought you was out bowling tonight. Yeah, I was. I came over to give somebody a message. come on, Sid, let's dance. What's the matter, Sid? I don't feel so good. - You sick, you mean? - Not sick, just kind of depressed. Oh, look, don't be repressed. Here. Look what I'm giving you. See? Well, take it. It's a lousy trick, Gladys. Well, I'll just lend it to you. And don't tell anybody. You gotta give it back in the morning. Thanks. Hi, Babe. - Yes, hello. - Gladys, I just- Sid and I are just old friends. - Won't you join us? - No, thank you. I came to tell you that Hinesie is out for blood. He was over at the bowling alley. He knows you two are out, and he's going crazy. Oh, Hinesie. - And he's got a knife. - The fooI. He's always got a knife. He's living in the past. That's not healthy, you think so, Sid? Look, I didn't come here to be funny. And I didn't come here because... ...I'm craving your company or because I wanna join your party or anything. - I came to tell you that he's dangerous. - He talks dangerous, but he isn't. I think I'll take a nap. Babe. Move over. Prez, pay up for me and take Gladys home, will you? Gladys? Sure. Sure, Sid, glad to. Got some important bookkeeping to do. Her is the cutest one. I remember you. I'm gonna take you home. All right. But wait a minute, I gotta take another nap. Oh, I see you. You don't need to drop anything. You abandoned woman, you hussy. After the way you behaved? Taking your pants off in Mr. Hasler's office? Don't touch me. I'm out with friends. And I'm glad I never married you. - Hello. - Hello. This is Sorokin, Mr. Hasler. Sorry to get you out so early, but it's important I talk to you at once. Okay, I'll be there right away. Thanks, I'll be waiting for you. The committee from the union's outside waiting to see you. Yeah, I sent for them. Come in. I'm sorry to drag you here, but I know you're having a union rally... - ... and I wanna talk to you first. - That's okay, Sid. I think I got ahold of some facts that may clean up this mess. It better be quick. Either we get the 7 and a half cents or we vote to strike. What I wanna ask is, will you keep the rally going till I get there and talk to you? - What about? - About solving this thing. There ought to be a time limit. All right. You're gonna parade first. - We sure are. - That'll give me time. Well, that's fair enough. Oh, Miss Williams, can I speak to you? - We'll wait for you downstairs, Babe. - Okay. - I know explanations are lousy- - Oh, no. Babe, you've gotta give me a chance to explain. I don't want explanations. It's humiliating. - But you mustn't think that- - I don't think anything, Sid. I don't care. If it's about you and Gladys, it's none of my business. But it is your business. Oh, please, I'm talking about something bigger than that. This is just great. can't we even talk to each other and make sense anymore? I don't see how. Not till this is over. I've been eating mud long enough. I've had it. Well, then, what do you suggest? Meet me after the rally tonight. I can't. I have a date. Well, that's that. I'll break it. I saw you. Now, Vernon, cut that out. You're just crazy, that's all. I'll call the police. You drove me too far this time. You'll find out. I know you're just trying to scare me, but... Help. Sid, Sid, you gotta do something. v ernon's not fooling this time. - Just calm yourself. - But he's after me. - He's been following me. - I'll fix everything. I'll take him aside and tell him the whole story. In the meantime, here's your key. Listen. I thought I heard something. You maniac. Hinesie, you idiot. I'm sure glad he got that out of his system. But how do you know he has? How do you-? Cut it out, Gladys. Everything is gonna be all right. - You gotta stop him. - I'll fix that, baby. Well, all right, I'm here. I hope this call turns out to be important. Wh-? What's going on around here? Look. Look. Now, that's not nice. I don't like this. This is company property, Sorokin. I better explain, Mr. Hasler. Well, I think somebody had better explain- - They're out to murder me. - I'll stop that. - Call the police. - Yes, sir. It's a plot to murder me. They've imported gangsters from Chicago. - It's the old Al capone mob. - I don't think so, Mr. Hasler. Don't argue with me. See those knives? - That's the work of foreigners. - But, Mr. Hasler... Hines, where you been? On the job, man. The place is full of gangsters. - They're out to get me. - They're not after you, they're after me. Why doesn't somebody do something? Get me the police. - You don't wanna arrest Hines, do you? - Hines? - He was trying to kill me. - He was? Hines, suppose you'd succeeded. And me in the middle of labor troubles. Suppose you hit him. I could've hit him. I was just trying to scare them. This why you called me to come down here and risk my life? I called because there's gonna be a strike tomorrow unless you listen. - Gladys, have his head patched up. - All right, Vernon. Leave me alone. I'm a fighter, I am. Dukes up. Come on, tiger. - Mr. Hasler. - Yeah? I'm going before the board of directors. - You are what? - If I can't solve this in any other way. - Solve what? Sometimes- - I've been up all night with your ledger. - What did you say? - I apologize. I know you didn't hire me... ...as a safecracker but I had to get some facts. I been through your books. That 7 and a half cents was added to the cost six months ago. I can put you in jaiI, that's what I can do. Put you in jaiI. You can't. But you can give that raise. If you don't, I'll go before the board... ...and tell them the situation and how many orders have been cancelled. - Not one single- - There's a dozen cancellations. You're costing the company thousands. Mabel tried to tell you all day yesterday about Marx and Klein. And if this operation folds up, I fold with it, and I don't want to. So do me a favor. Sit down and talk to me. We're sure to win, ain't we, Prez? What kind of question is that? Sure we are. Babe'll tell you. The answer is yes. That's the answer to everything tonight. Babe and me was up half the night figuring things out. I got it all written down on paper.

Mr. Hasler's here, and he thinks he can settle this strike. - Well, how? - Why don't you hear him out? Okay. Okay, Mr. Hasler. My friends. My friends. My friends. This strife within our ranks has disturbed me more than you know. And I think that you realize as well as I do... ...that there is only one way out of a thing like this. That's to compromise. And Sleeptite wants to meet you halfway. We offer a compromise. We'll give you 7 and a half cents... ...if you give up the claim to retroactive pay. - We ain't giving up nothing. - Wait a minute. Don't you see? We've won. We won. We won. We won. Sid. You were so wonderfuI. I could kiss you. I don't wanna get kissed for settling a strike. Of course if it's anything personal... It's very personal. And I say to you again in this hour of decision... ...that our responsibility to the garment industry... ...ring like a battle cry throughout the land. Production must increase. Cost must go down. And, fellow Sleeptiters, I just want to say... ...that this demonstration of harmony in our factory... ...strikes something deep down inside me. And I know that this party of yours is going to be a great success... ...because it stems from that genuine spirit of Sleeptite solidarity. We say okay to that, M.H. So on with our tribute to Sleeptite pajamas. And now on with the Sleeptite fashion parade. Wear Sleeptite at all social functions.
