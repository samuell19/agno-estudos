# There is a lonely road That runs from Ixopo # # Into the hills # # These hills are grass-covered And rolling # # And they are lovely Beyond any singing of it # # About you there is grass and bracken # # And you may hear The forlorn crying of the titihoya bird # # The grass of the veld is rich and matted You cannot see the soil # # The grass holds the rain and mist # # They seep into the ground Feeding the streams in every dove # # The clove is cool # # And green # # And lovely beyond any singing of it # # Where you stand The grass is rich and matted # # But the rich green hills break down # # They fall to the valley below # # And failing change # # For they grow red and bare # # They cannot hold the rain and mist # # The streams run dry in the doves # # Too many cattle feed an the grass # # It is not kept or guarded or and for # # It no longer keeps men, guards men # # Cares for men # # The titihoya # # Cries here no more # # The great red hills stand desolate # # And the earth has torn away like flesh # # These are the valleys Of old men and old women # # Of mothers and children # # The men are away # # The young men and the girls are away # # The soil cannot keep them # # Anymore # You got your Latin grammar to study on the train? Yes, Grandfather. How are you getting on with your other subjects? Very well. - Geography, do you like that? - Yes. - Now, you remember, you write to me. Hmm? - Yes, I will. You promise? That's a good boy. There's Stephen Kumalo. - I won't be a moment. - Arthur? Yes? I don't know what the customs are now in Johannesburg. They may have changed since I was there. But in our village, one does not go out of one's way to speak to a black. I have friends among the Zulus, Father. And my friends are my friends, both in Johannesburg and elsewhere. Then speak to him in Johannesburg. # Johannesburg! Johannesburg! # # Johannesburg! Johannesburg! # # Train go now to Johannesburg # - # Farewell! Go well! # - # Farewell!

Ah, Mr. Jarvis! Beg your pardon. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse ma. You're making a journey, Reverend? To Johannesburg, sir. It is my first long journey anywhere. - I... I go to find my son. - To find him? Well, it is nearly a year since we had a letter from him. Letters can be lost. He's been in the mines. I'm told that no young man works in the mines and does not change. Oh, Johannesburg is a big city, mfundisi. Well, my sister, Gertrude, is there, and my brother, John. I will go there first. Well, I do hope you find your son. It's always a pleasure to see you, sir. Perhaps when you come again to Ndotsheni... Yes, yes. I won't forget. Stay well, mfundisi. Go well, sir. John? What is it, mfundisi? Have I changed so much, my brother? The old gospel bird, scratching round here in the big city. Stephen! Ah, Stephen. Ah... Gertrude's boy. Come here, son. Come here. Alex, the mfundisi is your uncle. Alex. Ah. Gentlemen, my own brother, my mother's son, has come. Gentlemen, we will conclude the deal tomorrow at William's. Come, brother, come, come. I must take a look at you, Stephen. You get much rain down your way this year? Oh, less than we needed, John. Ah, well. But you must pray. And you must pray more. Tell me, where is our sister, Gertrude? She's gone. Gone? Brother, I don't know whether it was you that sent our dear sister to Johannesburg or not, but if it was, it was a big mistake. Uh... She came to find her a husband. She found plenty husband. Stephen. There is a new thing that is growing in Johannesburg. And you people in the country, you don't understand the way life is here. How is life different here, my brother? Stephen, in Johannesburg, it's the mines. Everything is the mines. The new buildings, the city hall. Wonderful new hospital. The rich mansions. All built with gold from the mines. But when gold is found, it's not we that get more for our labor. They bring us in from the bush, and we dig, dig, dig underground, for three shillings a day. And from our wages, they take a heavy tax. But what would a man like you from Ndotsheni, who falls on his knees and prays, know about things like that? We in Johannesburg, we know. What should be done with our sister's boy? Take him back to your hills and your sheet-iron chapel and your rusty God. Money. Money is the Tixo here in Johannesburg. There is one thing more I must ask. Where is my son, Absalom? Gone, with my son, Matthew. They left together? I threw them out. Where are they? I hear they got a room in Sophiatown. They work in a factory there. Do you know the factory? Yes, I do. I have a paper outside. Come. Doornfontein Textile Company. 14 Krause Street. You have a telephone. May I call? Why? To ask if Absalom Kumalo works there? Perhaps you want them to bring him to the telephone. They do not do such things for black men, my brother. Thank you. Good-bye, John. Stephen. Your sister's boy. Good-bye. You old faker in Christ. Yes, he did work here, you know. But he left a few months ago now. Could you tell me where he went? 7723rd Avenue, Alexandra. Thank you, sir.

He's been paroled. Partly because of his good behavior and partly because of his age. But mainly because there's a girl pregnant by him. - Is he married? - No, mfundisi. Pregnant and unmarried. Do sit down. Look, he's promised me that he'll work hard to support the child and its mother. He's living with the girl in, um, Pimville. - Pimville? - Shanty Town. The streets are... Well, they're pretty hard to get about in. I'd have to take you. Mr. Eland, could you go tonight? No, not tonight, mfundisi. But if you could be here early tomorrow morning. Oh, yes. Thank you. Alex. Alex. Alex. Absalom. I woke up. The bed was empty. 1 thought you had run away. Where would I run? Come home. Home? Shanty Town. Filth. Nothing. That is home. Weep the house dean. Nobody can keep Shanty Town clean. Go home. Irina. I have never been able to bring you a gift. [don't need gifts. Never enough to live on. Even... the way we live. A shop. That's what I want. A shop, just like my uncle's. But where could you get the money? I'll get it. You won't steal again? I'll get it. But, Absalom, if they catch you one more time, they're gonna put you in a prison for your whole lifetime. Goddamn this world. Uncle Stephen? Yes, Alex? This room is small and it's not clean. Well, it's the best they had. Are we going to live here? Oh, no. You will live in Ndotsheni, in the country. In my home. What will our house be like? Oh, it's small and it's gray. Is there grass? Yes, and flowers. Why is it gray? - What? - The house. Well, because it has not been painted. Do you have to boil the water from the tap? No, no, Alex. We get water from a spring. There's a tree that my son used to climb. He liked to sleep in it. - Like a nest? - Yes, like a nest. Come, sit here. # There's a lime gray house # # In a one-street town # # And the deer stands open # # And the steps run down # # And you prop up the window # # With a stick on the sill # # And you can't spring water # # From the bottom of the hill # # And the white Star of Bethlehem # # Grows in the yard # # And I can't really describe it # # But I'm trying hard # # It's not much to tell about # # ifs not much to picture out # # And the only thing special is # # It's home # # It's a lung road, God knows # # A long and turning iron road That leads to Ndotsheni # # How I came, God knows By what ridges, streams, and valleys # # And how we shall return Is in God's keeping # # Many bright days, many dark nights # # We must ride on iron # # Before we see # # That house again # # There's a lamp in the road # # And it lights the face # # of the one who waits there # # In her quiet place # # With her hands always busy # # Over needle and thread # # or the fire in the kitchen # # To bake tomorrow's bread # # And she always has love enough # # Tu take you in # # And her house will rest you # # Wherever you've been # # It's not much to tell about # # ifs not much to picture out # # And the only thing special is # # It's home # # Big Mole was a digger Of the fastest kind # # He'd dig in the earth Like you think in your mind # # When Big Mole came To the side of a hill # # Instead of going over He'd start in to drill # # He promised his mother A well in the town # # And he brought boiling water From a thousand feet down # # Down, down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # Down, down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # He can go through rock He can go through coal # # Whenever you come to an oversize hole # # Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mole Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mule, Big Black Mole # # When Mule was a youngster They'd show him a mine # # He said, "I like the idea fine # # Let me have that hose Let me have that drill" # # If they hadn't shut it off He'd be boring still # # And down at the bottom He thanked at I around # # Till he chunked out a city Six mile in the ground # # Down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # Down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # You can bet your pants You can bet your sou! # # Whenever you come to a man-size hole # # Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mole Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mole # # Big Mole had a girl Who was small and sweet # # He promised her diamonds For her hands and feet # # He dug so deep and he dug so well # # He broke right into The ceiling of hell # # And he looked the old devil Spang in the eye # # And he said "I'm not coming back here till I die" # # Down, down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # Down, down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile down # # He can go through rock He can go through coal # # Whenever you come To a sure enough hole # # Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole Big Black Mole # # Down at the bottom is Big Black Mole # # Big Black Mule, Big Black Mole # - You... - Outside. Outside, I said. Did you bring the gun? Listen. The white man never lock his doors, day or night. - Why not? - He say, "Anybody want what I've got, he can come and take it away." That's what he say. Then why do we need a gun when we go there? Because nobody ever knows when he's gonna need a gun, and you've got the gun. But Jo... Johannes says there won't be anybody there. The white man went for a trip somewhere, and the servant gets home late every night. Hey, man. Look... That's the way we think it's gonna be. What happens if somebody comes in? We don't wanna take any chances. - Matthew! - Right with you, baby. - What do you say? - I think it's better without the gun. I don't, see? Look. We get to the new gold fields that just opened. If you want to help us raise the money to get there, we'll take you along. You're in. But if you're scared to carry that cheap revolver of yours, you're no use to us at all. Bring it or stay home. Eat your cookies. Johannes! Think it over, country boy. I'm on parole. You're not. Listen. You're just going to be one more black boy in the gold field. They never find you. Come on. Change your name, man. New clothes. Cash in your pocket. There'll be no more Absalom Kumalo. Irina? Irina? Irina? This is the Reverend Stephen Kumalo, Irina. Absalom's father. He's come to Johannesburg to find Absalom. He's not here. Where is he, then? I do not know. He-He did not come home last night. I do not know where he is. Has he left you? Maybe. Could I be alone with her a moment? - Irina? - Yes, mfundisi? Perhaps my son never spoke of me to you. We love him very much, his mother and I. Do you believe that? Yes, mfundisi. He has lived here with you for some time? Yes. You were not married in the church? No. And you are to have a child. Yes. Why has he left you? There is no money. Do you have a family? Have no one. But you lived somewhere before you met Absalom? Sophiatown. Alone? Nobody lives alone in Sophiatown. You lived there with your first husband? Yes. My first. How many have there been? There have been three. Three. And now you will seek a fourth? No, I wait for Absalom. No. You would go to anyone. I think you would do anything. I'm an old man, Absalom's father. You would come to me if I asked you. - No! - Yes. You think an mfundisi is not a man? What if I desired you with my whole body? What if I desire you now? That would not be right. Was it right before with the others? No. Then why would you not be willing with me? I do not know. Then you would be willing? Would you be willing? Speak. Tell me. I could be willing. Yes. You are a woman who could go to anyone. Why did you come here? How would I know what you want or what you think? I don't... I'm to have a child. Your Absalom is gone. I love Absalom. He has brought me trouble, but... I love Absalom. I love Absalom. - Please, please forgive me. - I love Absalom. - I should not have put you to such a test. - Absalom! Absalom! Will you forgive me? We all do what we must do. Not what we wish but what we can. I am searching for my son. - Absalom! - If I find him, I'll come and tell you... Absalom.

My father. My son! If only I had come sooner. But when this trouble is over, you will come back to Ndotsheni and be content in our quietness. You were a boy without guile and without anger... Oh, my father! Yes? Yes? I cannot say! Son, I know you so well that I... 1 know you could not be guilty of these crimes. You need not fear what the judge will say. You will live again at Ndotsheni. [shall never come home. Why, my son? Because I am guilty. Of what, my son? I killed the white man. Th-This cannot be true. He... - He was shot in his house. - Yes. There are three men accused in his murder. - You are shielding someone. - No, sir. We were there. Matthew Kumalo, Johannes Pafuri, and I. Johannes struck the servant, and it was I who carried the revolver. And you killed this man? I did not mean to kill him. We thought he would not be there. Suddenly, he was there, and I was frightened and... My son. I stand here and see you. And a kind of dizziness comes over me so that... I'm not sure what is real or whether this is... a true place or in a dream. Did you tell me... you, my son, Absalom... that you had killed a man? Yes. That is the truth. But why? Answer me. We needed money to go to the gold fields. That is no answer... to steal, to take a life. You... You were not taught this. What is your answer? Father. It's in the air we breathe. The life we live. Here, we have nothing. We are nothing! Absalom! This earth is yours. This air, this life. You are Kumalo. This you were taught as I was and my father before me. Father, you do not understand. Here, we live like cattle. My son, our fathers atoned before tribal law. But we know salvation is in truth, as I have taught you, and it is... I'm sorry, mfundisi. It's time for you to go. My son. My son. Stay well, my son. Go well, my father. No, no, no. Stephen! Brother, we must get a lawyer. A lawyer. Why? The story is plain. What is the story? They went to a house they thought was empty... struck down the servant, and when the white man appeared, my son shot him. My brother, perhaps you do not need a lawyer after all. Will you get Matthew a lawyer? And Johannes Pafuri. You see, my brother... there was no proof that my son, Matthew, or Johannes were there at all. But there is an identification by the servant. And my son says they were there. Well, when a lawyer get through with that, maybe not. The only one that the servant identified was Johannes. They said he knew him by his eyes. With his face covered up. It would be very hard to be sure that it was Johannes Pafuri, wouldn't it? And our lawyer will bring it up in court. He'll shake that servant up plenty. And there's no other evidence. There's no other evidence that they were there, positively not. Except that they were there. They will have to say they were there. But why, my brother? Because it is the truth. And the court will recognize the truth. The truth? My God, man. Why should your son tell the truth in a white man's court? Does he want to get himself hanged? You listen to me, Stephen. My son, Matthew, and Johannes Pafuri are going to plead not guilty. I'll get them off. You'd better tell your son, Absalom, to keep his mouth shut, or I'll fix him myself. Speak to him. Speak to him. I have. He will plead guilty. Stephen, a man who pleads guilty to murder get the punishment of first degree. That's hanging, with a sack over his head. Stephen, if you want Absalom to live, please, tell him to plead not guilty. # Before Lord God Made the sea and the land # # He held all the stars In the palm of his hand # # And they ran through his fingers Like grains of sand # # And one little star fell alone # # And the Lord God hunted Through the wide night air # # For the lime dark star On the wind down were # # And he stated and promised # # He'd take special care # # So it wouldn't get lost again # # New, a man don't mind If the stars grow dim # # If the clouds blow over and darken him # # So long as the Lord God's Watching over him # # Keeping track # # How it all goes on # # But I've been walking Through the night and the day # # Till my eyes get weary And my hair turns gray # # And sometimes it seems Maybe God's gone away # # Forgetting the promise # # That we heard him say # # And we're lost out here in the stars # # Little stars # # Big stars # # Blowing through the night # # And we're lost # # Out here in the stars # # Little stars # # Big stars # # Blowing through # # The night # # And we're lost And we're lost # # And we're lost, and we're lost # # And we're lost out here in the stars # # Here in the stars # # Here in the stars # # If I tell truth to you # # My love, my own # # Grief is your gift to me # # Grief alone # # Wild passion at midnight # # Wild anger at dawn # # Yet when you're absent # # I weep # # You're gone # # Stay well # # keeper of my love # # Go well # # Throughout all your days # # Your star # # The luckiest star above # # Your ways # # The luckiest ways # # Since unto you # # My one love is given # # And since with you # # It will remain # # Though you bring fear of hell # # Despair of heaven # # Stay well # # Come well to my door # # Again # Irina?

Would you wish to marry him in prison... so that your child will bear his name? Does he wish it? Yes. Then I wish it. Mfundisi. Will they kill him? Nothing is sure. But I want him to live.

You have been identified as one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on October the 8th between 11:00 and 12:00. Were you there at that time? No, sir, I never been this place. Where were you? At Mrs. Ndela's in End Street. How do you know you were there at eleven o'clock? Because we were at a place dancing till nearly 11:00. And at 11:00, we were at Mrs. Ndela's. Who else was there? Matthew Kumalo was there. And the girls, Linda and Rose. The witness is excused. Will Matthew Kumalo take the stand? Matthew Kumalo, you are accused of being one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on October the 8th between 11:00 and 12:00. - Were you there at that time? - No, sir. - Where were you? - Mrs. Ndela's house in End Street. - You're sure of the time? - Yes, sir. We had been dancing at a place in High Street. Then we went to Mrs. Ndela's house. We got there, she said, "Come in. You're late." We saw it was near 11:00. Do you know Absalom Kumalo? Yes, sir. He is the son of my father's brother. Was he with you that evening? No, sir. - Do you know where he was? - No, sir. The witness is excused. Will Absalom Kumalo take the stand? Absalom Kumalo... you are accused of being one of three masked men who entered the kitchen of Arthur Jarvis on October the 8th between 11:00 and 12:00 in the evening. Were you there at that time? Yes, sir. Who were the two masked men with you? Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri. What was your purpose in going there? - To steal something from the house. - But why did you choose this day? Because Johannes said that the house would be empty at that time. The same Johannes Pafuri here? Yes, sir. Tell the court what happened. We went into the kitchen, and there was a servant there. This man was afraid. He saw my revolver. He said, "What do you want?" Johannes said, "We want money and clothes." This man said, "You cannot do such a thing." Johannes said, "Do you want to die?" And this man called out, "Master. Master." And Johannes struck him over the head with the iron bar. A white man came into the doorway. I was frightened. I fired the revolver. The white man fell. And what did you do next? I prayed. How did the police find you? Johannes Pafuri brought them to where I was. And what did you tell the police? Exactly that which I have just told you. And every word you have said is true? Every word of it. There is no lie in it? There is no lie in it. For I have said to myself... I shall not lie anymore, all the rest of my days. And I have finished with evil. 1 have no further questions, Mr. Charmichael. The witness will step down. Mnumzane. I have been waiting for you. Yes? Would you intercede for my son? If you do not help, he will die for his truthfulness. Have you thought of what it is for me that my son is dead? I have tried. I... Have you thought what it is for his mother? She will die of this. It's in her face. I see the face of my son's mother. I... Oh, I know what this is to you, but... if he were only to live, even shut up, even far from us. He grew up in Ndotsheni. There was no evil in him there. He could see from our house up through the clove to your great house. Your son was a friend of my people. Th-This would not have happened if it were not for the gold mines and the great city your people have built and... And the little hope we have... Parson. There are two races in South Africa. The difference between us is greater than that I live on a hill and you live in the valley. If my son had killed your son, 1 would not have come to you for mercy. Whether it was my son or yours, I would have said, "Let him answer to the law." But... you could save him. Mfundisi. You have not heard or understood me. Those who will not keep order must be kept in order. Those who lift their hands to kill must know that the penalty for death is death. Mnumzane, I read my Testament carefully. Jesus has not said this. Have you anything more to say to me? No. No, mnumzane. The evidence in this case is in many ways inconclusive, unsatisfactory, and fragmentary. Some of the accused appear to have testified in collusion with each other or other witnesses. The alibis offered by Matthew and Johannes are obviously doubtful. No reason has come to light why Absalom should involve in the robbery and murder two men who were not with him at the time and not guilty. And yet, after long and thoughtful consideration... my assessors and I have come to the conclusion that the guilt against Matthew and Johannes is not sufficiently established. There remains the case against Absalom Kumalo. No reason has been offered why he should confess to a deed he did not commit. And his own insistence that he had no intention to kill operates to validate the confession itself. Matthew Kumalo and Johannes Pafuri. You are discharged and may step down. Absalom Kumalo. You are a young man. But this court has a solemn duty to protect society against the murderous attacks of dangerous men, young or old... and to show clearly it will punish such offenders. Absalom Kumalo. Have you anything to say before I pronounce sentence? Wave om Ms to say. That I killed this man... but I did not mean to kill him. I was afraid. I now sentence you, Absalom Kumalo, to be returned to custody... and to be hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. # Cry, the beloved country # # Cry, the beloved land # # The wasted childhood, the wasted youth # # The wasted man # # Cry, the broken tribes # # And the broken hills # # And the right and wrong forsaken # # The greed that destroys us # # The birds # # That cry no more # # Cry, the beloved country # # Cry, the beloved land # # Cry, the lost son # # The lost tribe # # The lost # # Cry, the beloved country # # Cry, the beloved land # # The wasted childhood, the wasted youth # # The wasted man # # Cry, the broken tribes # # And the broken hills # # And the right and wrong forsaken # # The greed that destroys us # # The birds that cry no more # # Cry, the beloved country # # Cw, the lost tribe # # The lost son # ...to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony.

My son and my daughter. Irina will come with me to Ndotsheni. I'm glad, my father. We shall care for your child as if it were our own. All right, mfundisi, it's time to go. Give us a little time. Please. Will you wish to say good-bye to Irina? There is no way to say good-bye. - There will be an appeal. - But it will not help. I'm afraid. Afraid of the hanging. Be of courage, my son. It is of no help to be of courage! I'm afraid... of the rope! Of the hanging! Please, don't go. No, no, no, no, no, no! # Cry, the unborn son # # Fatherless # # Let him not be moved By the song of the bird # # Nor give his heart to a mountain # # Nor to a valley # # Cry, the beloved country # # Cry, the beloved land # # Cry, the beloved land # Welcome, little one. The appeal has failed. This is Alex. My child. And this is Irina. You are my daughter. Come, Alex. Mfundisi is here! Welcome. This is my nephew, Alex. He will remain here with us. - Welcome. Wind this is Irina. My son's bride. Please let her be welcome among you. Welcome. # When Mole was a younker They showed him a mine # # He said, "I like the idea fine # # Let me have that hose Let me have that drill" # # If they hadn't shut it off He'd be boring still # # And down at the bottom He thanked at I around # # Till he chunked out a city Six mile in the ground # # Down, down, down, down # # Three mile, four mile, five mile # - Hi, there. - Hi. What's that? 41. digging machine. Does it work? Sometimes. I made it myself. - What's your name? - Alex. Mine's Edward. Is your uncle the mfundisi? Yes. I know a lot of Zulu words. IsiNgisi is English, right? - Yes. - And amanzi is water, right? Yes. My father taught me Zulu. Where is your father? He died in Johannesburg. Where's yours? I don't know. I don't have any father. I'll bet this would work all the time if you fixed it. Maybe. I have to go now. My grandfather's waiting for me. I could comeback here tonight. And maybe we could both fix that old toy together. All right? See you later. Well, good-bye, Alex. Alex? It's Edward. Oh, hi there. We could fix that old toy now. Okay. Let's take a look at it. Edward! [told you never to come into the village without my permission. When you're a man, you'll live your own life. But while you live with me, never let me see you here again alone. - But I promised Alex... - Edward! There are not many rules in my house... but this I do know. There are still some things I cannot bear to look at. Now come home. 1 am resigning from my pastorate at Ndotsheni. I shall be your mfundisi no more. It had been my hope to end my years here, but I cannot now. My people, if I stay here now, I become a hindrance to you and not a help. And so I must go. You cannot go, mfundisi! You cannot go! Ndotsheni is a poor village, and it will go poorer still, and no one will help you while I remain. Listen. Listen, please! Please listen! When I... When I began to serve my God and my church... I had a sure faith that the God of our world ordered things well with men. I had a sure faith that though there was good and evil, 1 knew which was good and God knew it. And men were better in their hearts for choosing good and not evil. Something has shaken my faith. I am not sure. I am lost. I am not sure that we are not all lost here. And a leader should not be lost. He should know the way. So I... I must resign my place. No, stay. Stay. - We need you! - I cannot stay! This terrible thing has happened. My son will hang. If I stay, little by little, you will shrink away from me and away from this church. Stones will break those windows still unbroken. This rusty roof will leak... and the unpainted walls of this chapel that I have loved will stand empty and roofless. And I... I shall live in despair beside it, knowing that I have done this to you... and to my church, by remaining here. Go home. Go home. I shall not preach here again. Go home. Go. Mfundisi. - Yes? - She's fallen asleep. She meant to watch with you at this hour, but she's fallen asleep. It is past 4:00. He is awake now. Yes. Why do they choose the morning? I do not know, my father. My daughter. Stay with her. I'm going up into the mountain. Irina. I am glad he found you, not some other. Stephen Kumalo. Stephen Kumalo. Last night, when you spoke to your congregation... 1 was outside your church. I heard them when they cried out to you. I heard when they said, "Do not go, mfundisi. Stay with us. Stay in Ndotsheni If I stayed, do you know what I would preach here? If there is a God, he has hidden and has not spoken to men. That we're all lost here, the fools and the wise. Lost and hopeless. Condemned on this rock that goes round the sun without meaning. Better try and find a meaning, Stephen Kumalo. Stephen Kumalo. You must listen to your people. Listen to those who need you. Ge well, mfundisi. Oh, Absalom. My son!
