[birds chirping] [rocket engine whooshing] [soft lively music] [girl humming] [soft music] [thunder rumbling] [soft ominous music] [girl humming "Ring Around The Rosie"] [Alec] Keep it running. [girl humming] [eerie music] - [bird cawing] - [Alex sighs] [door slams] [eerie music] Woof! [tense music] Final notice. Surprised you and your filthy brood... are still here. I told you. I'm not giving you the land. That's the beauty of it, sweetheart. It's already mine. You have 48 hours to evacuate. Then the bulldozers come in. [making whooshing noises] The great spectacle... of progress! You should stick around and watch the fireworks. [thunder rumbling] [woman speaking in foreign language] [Alec choking and gagging] [Alec laughing] [thunder rumbling] [body thudding] [bird squawking] - [girl humming] - [eerie music] [soft music] [lively music] [lively music continues] [lively music continues] [Jake] Yeah. Our house is basically done. Stayed up 'til 10 finishing it. [Bo] Just now? Wow. I thought you'd be done with that by now. [Jake] Frank moved our Halloween stuff to storage. It took a while to get back. Is he okay with you calling him Frank? What else would I call him? Anyway, I'm just waiting for him to hang the darn lights. Oh, what, you can't do 'em yourself? - [Bo laughing] - [Carson] Oh, come on. You can't still be afraid of heights. That fall was a decade ago. It was six years. Oh, yeah. Big difference. And it's not a fear of heights. It's a love of the ground. - Huh. - Right, right. So it's not the fall that scares you. It's the sudden stop. [eerie music] Who ah. Shut the Freddy puk. Pop-up Halloween store in a creepy lot? Awesome. [soft ominous music] [Jake] Let me see. [camera clicks] Bummer. It won't upload. [Carson] Dead zone? [Bo] Dead zone. - [Jake] Let's check it out. - [Carson] Cool. [Bo] Come on, Carson. [Carson] I'm coming, Bo Peep. [creepy carnival music playing on speakers] - [display screeches] - [boys gasp and laugh] [Clown] Or a trick. Remember this card. It'll be the last thing... [demonic voice] ...you'll ever see! [wicked laughing] Dude, saw that coming a mile away. Yeah, sure you did. Come on. [canned growling] We're so coming here for our costumes. [display monster growling] You two have put it off long enough. Yeah, about that. [display monster growling] Look, so I know you're like a whole year younger than me basically. Eight months, Carson. Chill. [display monster] Don't forget to duck, or you'll be a dead duck. [eerie music continues] See, here's the thing. - [display thunking] - [display creature chittering] Eight months from now, you'll be growing hair on your chest and stealing your dad's aftershave. He's not my dad. Wait, you grew hair on chest? Congrats. Thanks. I mean, it's more like fuzz, but still. Carson who gives a crap about your peach fuzz. What's your point? I'm not trick or treating this year. What? [display creature chittering] Halloween's for kids. We trick or treat every year. It's what we do. Bo, tell him. Yeah, Bo. Tell him. Yeah. Well, I mean, it is kind of cold this year, Jake. Look, we could do something actually fun, like sneak into Ray Marino's Halloween party. You'd seriously rather go to some stupid high school party you're not even invited to? We don't have to do that. I'm just saying we can't trick or treat forever. Jake, come on man. [ominous music] [lively music] [Sue] Tell me what you like about her. [Joanie] Um, I love her gems and her orange hair... - [Sue] So pretty, right? - [Joanie] And her teal eyes. Are you kidding me. Jake, this is Joanie's house now too, all right? I don't care. We don't do princesses on Halloween. It's meant to be scary. Me and dad always did it scary. But I wanna be a princess for Halloween. Princesses suck. So that's stupid. Jake, that is enough. [Sue] Honey, honey, honey, honey. It's a family tradition. Well, it might be time to start a new tradition. Why don't you finish this. [soft music] Seriously? Are you kidd...? You know nothing about me! [soft music] Hello? [soft music] Ahhhh! Surrender your soul! - Geez. - [Kate laughing] Your face. Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Is Carson home? Oh yeah. He's in his room hiding from chores. But who needs him when I have you, right? - Wanna help? - Yeah. Um, I mean, yes. Yep, sure. Related? She's much better looking than Carson. [Kate giggling] Rah! Wow. Impressive. Boy Scouts. Very cute. What's this? Oh, that's probably from Mrs. Tulmeister. My third grade teacher. Ms. Dullmeister? Yeah, I had her too. You did? She always hands out apples instead of candy. Oh yeah, apples and buttons. I guess some things never change. Can I keep it? Only if you promise to wear it. It's not for me. Hey, not judging. Who knows that your kids are into these days? Yeah. Who knows? [chuckling] [fast rapping] [knocking on door] Miss me so soon? [indistinct music playing on cell phone] Where's all your Star Wars stuff? Dude, we're gonna be in high school next year. It's like you're in denial. Yeah, but you still play with toy guns? That's no toy. With dart mods, I've got it to military-grade accuracy. You gonna change your mind? On what? Trick or treating? [cell phone clicks, music stops] What's gotten you so whacked out over trick or treating? It's just not that fun anymore. Yeah. So hanging out with me and Bo is not that fun anymore? Well, Fright Night's tomorrow night, which is basically Halloween anyway. Basically Halloween is not Halloween. Dude, no! Not that one! [dart gun beeping] [dart gun fires] Dart mods. Like I said. We're doing something Saturday. The three of us, best holiday of the year, just like always. It's gonna be awesome. All right, all right, sheesh. Figure it out, but don't shoot me over it. Better not be lame, or I'm out! [tense TV music] Whatcha doing? Heading out with my friends. I'm sorry your dad died 'cause of bone cancer. It was blood cancer. But yeah, I guess blood's made in the bones. Mom says that's why you're mad all the time. Uh [clears throat]. Hey, Frank offered to take you guys to pick out your Halloween costumes tomorrow. - Yay! - Yay! I know it's a little last minute, but will you go? Mom... Mom, no. I'm not even trick or treating this year. What are you talking about? You guys go trick or treating every year. Carson thinks we're too old and Bo's too much of a wuss to argue. I'm sorry, honey. I know how much you look forward to it. But hey, you could take Joanie. - The fairytale princess? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, Jake! Please take me. Okay, go brush your teeth, honey. I'm gonna get you! Look, I need to make en effort to spend time with them, all right? I mean it. Have a good time tonight. [dramatic music] [Woman] Oh Alec, please don't go. The town's people fear her. They say she is... different. [Alec] Yes, I think it's high time I paid a visit - to the old matron. - [people gasp] I am a business man after all, surely she could be reasoned with. I will make her an offer she can't refuse. [dramatic music] If you must have my hand, Mr. Windsor- [Alec] Wait! Then you'll have it forever. She's a witch! [witch cackling] [Narrator] And so it is believed that the spirit of the deceased is bound to this dimension. A body never found, a curse never broken. He roams waiting for the one night of the year: All Hallow's Eve, the anniversary of his death, to claim his way back from his doom, purgatory. [dramatic music] [audience applauds] Do you really think there's a cursed body under this town somewhere? Heck no. It's just some stupid local legend to keep kids home and out trouble on Halloween. No, I mean Alec Windsor's definitely a real guy. He built over half the town. And one day, he just disappeared. Yeah, yeah. It's a mystery. Hey, who's that talking to your sister? Ray Marino? Dang. Ray Marino? Can he even string a sentence together? [Carson] You don't need sentences when you got touchdowns, bro. [Jake] Is he seriously wearing himself as a costume? [lively music] Bye. So sis, Ray Marino, huh? None of your business, Carson. Well, I heard he's throwing the party of the year tomorrow. Mm-hmm, and you're not going. No kids allowed. Yeah, well, if I'm not going, then you're not. Why? Mom's gonna be out of town tomorrow and you're in charge. Carson, you can crash at my place tomorrow night. Perfect. Thank you Jake! I owe you one. Dude, what was that? That was our in. What do you mean, our in? Carson, read the room. Besides, we've got our own awesome plans. Do we though? No, but we're working on it, right? Right. We can always just watch a scary move at my place. [mocking] Oh, will your mom give you milky and cookie? Could she gimme your blankie? Dude! Grow a pair. We need something super creepy or I'm out. - I mean it. - [phone tones] You want something really creepy? How about a night locked in here? [Bo] What? [Jake] The Halloween Me gas tore. [Carson] Now we're talking. Are you crazy? Why the heck would we wanna do that? Because we're not giving up a Halloween tradition just because Carson grew a chin hair. It's chest hair and there's way more than one, F.Y.I. - [Bo] Yeah. No, not in. - [Jake] Bo, come on. Come on Bo-peep, you're told to be scared of ghosts. Am I too old to be scared of the law? Bo, please. Just one in, all in. Like always? My god, you guys are seriously nuts. [all] Boo ya! [tense music] [phone rings] Yo. No, I say Bo's, you say mine, Bo says yours. No, I've downloaded movies on the tablet. Okay, cool. Bye. [gentle eerie music] [Frank] Hey, trick or treat. What would you like? [eerie music] [thunder rumbling] Hey, Grandma G. [scary music] Don't stay out late Jake. You hear me? Grandma, stop scaring my friends. Listen Bo, you stay safe, please. - Always. - Please. Yes, I know. [Bo kissing] - [lively music] - [kids chattering] [Bo] So, what's your new girlfriend Kate up to tonight? [Jake] Okay, she's not my girlfriend. Besides, Carson's sister? [scoffs] Come on. She still thinks we're little kids. [Bo] Half sister... And we're not. [Jake] Yeah, well, she's only into guys like Ray Marino, football legend slash town hero slash party planner of the century. Yeah, well, he's too obvious. Okay, next time you see her, say "Hey, are you made of copper and tellurium? Because baby, you're cute." Copper's C U and Tellurium's T E. It'll probably work better on paper. Boo! Oh my god, Carson. It's not a joke if you have to explain the punchline, dude. [Bo] Whatever. What's that? Gonna play us some tunes? Nah, this is gonna make you guys dance! [ominous music] [Bo] Trick or treat, or illegal trespass? I feel like there might've been an option in-between. [Carson] Oh come one, Bo-peep, it'll be be wicked. [Jake] This is amazing. - [canned maniacal laughing] - [scary indistinct dialogue] [switch clicks] - [bird quacks] - [clock chimes] - [keys jingling] - [lock latching] Psst. Hey Bo, they gone? [clock chiming] [eerie warbling] What's wrong with you? It's not even midnight yet. I think I saw... The... the... the... what? The light. What light? Bo, the store closed, and we're still inside. As planned. You mean the store's locked and we're trapped inside. [evil red hand rattles] That scared me! You guys are serious wusses, you know that? - [spider shrieks] - [Carson yelps] If only we had peach fuzz to make us big and strong like you, Carson. I gotta take a whizz. Pretty sure you just did. ["Back to the House" by Space Capone] - [inaudible] - [upbeat music continues] [inaudible] [inaudible] [toy screeching] [Bo] I was wrong about tonight. This is fun. Hell yeah. Jakey, you wanna tell us a scary story? [electricity buzzing] What was that? Glitchy generator. Chill. This building is ancient. Here's some spare balls, Bo-Peep. Yours seem to be missing. [tense music] Was that there before? [Carson] I'm gonna say... yes? Here, how about we share 'em? [ominous music] Here. No, sorry. Lactose intolerant. A man can't live on Skittles alone. - Come on, here, just try 'em. - Fine. [Jake] Here, "The Legend of Alec Windsor". Where do you think this was? Who knows. I mean, it could've been anywhere. [Bo] Wait. [eerie music] Guys, the twin chimneys. Is that the old mill? It has to be! - [Carson] Hold on. Gimme this. - [Bo] Dude! Holy crap, that's a few blocks from here! That was a good Halloween. [Carson] Yeah man, one of the best. - [clock chimes] - [distant monster growling] Nope, yeah. I'm done, too creepy. Too creepy? This is why we came here. [electricity buzzes] [ghostly voice] Trick or treat? Remember this card, it'll be the last thing... [growling and laughing] Yikes. I told you it was an old building. We should find the breaker box. We should find an exit. Come on wimps. I bet it's in the back. See, Bo is always right. This is how every horror movie starts. [muffled pop music playing] ["Falling Into Me" by Cold Mountain] [phone rings] Hi, Mama. Yeah, everything's great. I'm on my way to the party right now. Carson is at Jake's for the night. Remember? Yes, I made sure to turn off all the lights. Yes, I... Yes. I also made sure that Carson took his phone. Relax Mama, I've got this, seriously. Everyone's great. I promise. All right. Love you. Bye. [sighs] Darn it, Carson. [tense music] [bucket rumbles] - [Jake] Oh my god! - Seriously?! Oh my god, give a kid a heart attack. Jeez! [electricity buzzes] So we're good then. Right? [gentle music] [rapid knocking] - Kate? Hi. - Hi. Frank, I said pause it. I'm sorry. [Kate chuckles] Happy Halloween! Um, Carson left his phone at home and Mom likes him reachable, so. The boys aren't here, they're all at Bo's. Oh. Oh my gosh, you're right. Sorry. It's okay. Hey, Carson didn't say he was staying here, did he? No, no, I blanked. Sorry about that. I will swing by there. - Have fun! - Okay. [gentle music] [rocking chair squeaking] Hi, Grandma G. [door knocking] - No one's home, Kate. - [startling music] Okay. Okay. Sorry to bother you. It's late, child. Go home. Okay. Bye. [Grandma G humming "Ring Around the Rosie"] [lively music] You little brats. [lively music] [dramatic music] - Gimme this. - Bro! Will Bo die never been kissed? [Carson laughs] Too bad, so sad. Will Carson? [Carson] Dude. Unoriginal. How the heck do I get out of here? [Fortune Teller] Ask the right questions, you'll get the right answers. [eerie music] Like that's not creepy. [eerie music] This thing is awesome. Ask the right questions, you'll get the right answers. Is the town haunted by a lost spirit? Is Alec Windsor roaming tonight? Are you two serious right now? - [fortune teller light dings] - [eerie music] Really? So does he want something? Or is he here to like, hang out? [fortune teller light dings] What does he want? [grandfather clock ticking] [grandfather clock tolls] - [fortune teller cackles] - [smoke hissing] [dramatic music] - [Alec Windsor] You! - [Alec laughing demonically] [light warbling then whooshing] [boys screaming] [recorded voice] The reaper comes in dark of night. [Alec voice] And so do I! - [monster growling] - [boys screaming] [Bo] No, no! [screaming] - Bo! - [Alec] Nighty night! [dramatic music] I only need one of you to get to sleep. Now, who wants a lullaby? [metal bat dragging] [Alec] Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of some child-like scum. What the heck just happened? I don't know. But I'd love my guitar case right about now. Forget the guitar! We can overtake it if we catch it by surprise. Are you kidding me? It's like The Hulk trapped in the reaper's body. We'll rip its legs off! Dude, gross. - It's not like it'll bleed. - It'll possess something else. Maybe something smaller. - [tense music] - [metal bat dragging] [Alec chucking menacingly] [Bo farts] Dude. I told you, lactose intolerant. - [Alec] Woof! - [boys screaming] - Come on, go, we gotta go! - Go, go, go! [dramatic music] Kids. [dramatic music] Filthy rodents! [bat crashes glass] [tense music] Time to sleep. Hold still. Carson, now! Jake, come on! [dramatic music] [light warbling] [Bo] Good thinking with the mirror. No more candy, Bo. [eerie music] [tense music] [phone beeps] [phone line ringing] [Lydia recording] Hey, it's Lydia. Sorry I missed you. Leave a message. [phone ringing] - Hey, Mrs. T. - [Sue's voice garbled] Hey, wait, you're break... Yeah, you're breaking up. Sorry, what? Look, Jake's phone just seems like it's out of service range somehow, but did you talk to them or did you only talk to Lydia? [Kate on phone] Hello? Kate? Kate, can you hear? Hi. Yeah, sorry, you cut out. But you know kids and their phones. Never charge 'em and never on 'em, right? No, but yeah, but they're doing great. Okay, well that's a relief, thank you Kate. - Have a good night. - Okay, all right, bye. [groans] [gentle music] [knocking on window] God damn, Carson. [banging rapidly] You think Jake will ever change his mind? About what, honey? About taking me trick or treating. I guess I would just say, you never know. Your brother's kinda silly sometimes. Hey, did you get that tonight? No, I thought you or Dad left it for me. I found it by my bed. No. We didn't. But I love that someone did. [exhales sharply] This is so stupid. [gentle music] [sighs] - [grumbles] - [hatch creaks open] So what the heck are we dealing with here, Bo? How should I know? Jake's the horror geek. All right, Jake, best guess? Dude, come on. A spirit that can't let go of this life, possibly someone who died here. Alec Windsor. I don't know who it is, but I don't think they wanna be friends. Theoretically, if it is all that, what could it do? Well, I need my book. But based on what we've seen, I'd say affect things or possess them. What's the difference? Well, one's making things move and the other's bringing things to life. Like the reaper! Great. So I guess we've got Jake to thank for this crap shoot. Carson, chill out. You wanted to come here. No, dude, I wanted to go to a cool party. You wanted to come here. Only 'cause you were too selfish to do what we usually do! Oh, and what's that? Stay 10-years-olds forever? [Bo] Guys, come on, let's just... Wanting to change things up isn't a crime, last I checked, Jake. You should try it sometime; might make you more fun to be around. [tense music] [metal shelf bangs] [eerie music] What was that? Guys? Idiots. Guys, where are you?! Was that Kate? [eerie shrill music] [boys scream] Hi. How did you get in here? I broke in. Guys, you know how insane this is? Good job, sis. Let's go! We have to go! We'll explain later. Hey! [eerie music] [light warbling] [light warbling then whooshing] [bear growling] You guys are in serious trouble. This place is wrecked. Kate! Where did you break in? I know you're not yelling at me. You're the little brat who left his phone at home and lied about where he is. And now I'm missing my party because the three... - Kate. - What? Please. Just, where's the window? What? You came in through the roof? Yeah. Okay Bo, you're the lightest. Yeah, and I'm also the weakest. True. We'll boost you up. You can go open the doors when you're outside. They're dead bolted, genius. We're all gonna have to climb out this way! All right, come on Jake, it's not that high. Try falling from up there, then tell me it's not that high. [dramatic music] [Kate] Hey, how is that bear moving? You don't wanna know. [Alec] Need to warm up these legs. Someone overstuffed this guy. [Bo grunts] [Alec] Just so we're all clear on the rules, I can't leave here without a body. That's a weird thing to say. Bo, hustle! I can't reach it! [Alec] Welcome to the party, princess. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! What's happening!? The store is trying to kill us. Carson, help! - Here. - What? - I don't know. - A pumpkin? [dramatic music] Bo, move it! [Bo] It's not enough, I need... I can't, we gotta go. It's too late. Bail! Oh my god, Bo. What? [Bo] Come on! [Kate screams] Help! [Alec] Hope you like earth, you filthy maggot. Help me! - Bo, hold on! - Hold on. [Alec] 'Cause you're about to eat dirt! All right, distract it. We'll get Bo, and get back to the storeroom. Okay. [Bo screaming] Oh my god, I'm gonna die! [dramatic music] [slow and deep] Hey Ted! [dart guns firing] [bear growling] [Alec] Not so fast. [Bo] Let me go, you demonic bear! Hey, take this. [dramatic music] - [Carson] Where's my case? - [Jake] Who cares! [Alec] I just need one of you runts! [Alec] Wait! - Go, go, go, go! - Jake, come on! - Jake! - Dude! [dramatic music] [Carson] Keep it shut! [Kate] Go, go, Bo! Hurry! Please! [door crashing] [Alec] Come on! [Kate] This is crazy. You guys couldn't do something simple, like camp in the backyard? Backyard camping's for kids. [Kate] Exactly! What do we do, what do we do, what do we do, what do we do? [Alec singing] Teddykins wants in. Jake, come on, give us something! - Hold on. - Yeah, hurry up! Here, hauntings, malicious. [Jake] Tortured spirits, cursed to Earth, or reluctant to cross over, express themselves through angry outbursts of energetic phenomena. Tortured spirits? [banging on door] For one hour on the anniversary of their death, they can possess things... or people. Seriously? What? Are you freaking kidding me? It says here you need to be asleep or unconscious to be possessed. Well, I guess I'm good. 'Cause I'm not sleeping for the rest of my life after this! Oh my god, oh my god. [Alec singing] Here's Teddykins! [door bangs] [dramatic music] Dude, bug spray? - You got a better idea? - 100 of 'em. There has to be another way out! There better be. That or we're dead. [tense music] Blueprints! Maybe there are floor plans or something, they could show us a way out! Uh, yeah. [tense music] [door bangs] [tense music] - You mean, like this? - [Alec grunting] [door bangs] Everything okay? I'm not sure. - Jake? - Yeah. It's just he's not answering his phone and neither is Lydia. They're probably all in a candy coma, fast asleep by now. He's with his buddies, he's fine. I won't be gone long. - [sighs] - [tense music] [dramatic music] Okay, here we are. Access door? - [Kate] Access to what? - Maybe a basement space? [dramatic music] Where is it? Right, right here. Hey guys? [Alec] Uh! Where do you think you're going? - Fan-freak in-tastic. - [Alec grunts and bangs] I need something stronger. We gotta get out of here. [soft music] - [rats squeaking] - [water dripping] [eerie shrill music] - It's freezing. - Yeah. - Here, just take this. - Oh, thank you. It just goes down. [soft music] [door creaking loudly] [soft music] What is this place? Well, it's not an exit. Guys. [Jake] Sacred Hearts home for Wayward Children. The orphanage. This is it. We've been right on top of it this whole time! The same picture is in my book. [soft music] [door snaps open] [soft music] Hey guys, I think I found our exit. [door banging] [Alec laughing maniacally] [dramatic music] Uh. Ahhhh! I need to find one with hands. [soft music] [rats squeaking] [Jake] Holy cow. This must have been a coal mine or something. Or an insane bootlegging den. What's a bootlegging den? You'll learn about it when you're older. Like high school? Less than a year from now? Sure, Carson. Yeah! Oh, that'll do. That'll do just fine. [light whooshing and warbling] [Nightcrawler growls] [dramatic music] [Bo shrieks] It's, it's, it's... Spit it out, Bo Peep! Whoa. - [Bo] It's him. - [Jake] Alec Windsor. Like the legend? - No way. - Yes way. So they just dumped his body down here? That's sick. And not the good sick. [Nightcrawler growling] [Nightcrawler roaring] Hey, hey, wait. If we make it out of here alive, I think I'm gonna take your advice and go for it with Kate. Seriously? Yeah. I mean, I'm no football hero, but after this we'll sure as heck be legends, right? Yeah. Yeah, eat dust, Ray Marino. - [Nightcrawler growling] - [dramatic music] [Nightcrawler roaring] [tense music] Holy cow. - [wind whistling] - [bats chittering] [soft music] How creepy is this? [soft music] - Whoa! - [tense music] What? Don't do that. [Carson] What's the point of this? [soft music] [Bo] Ew. Ew, ew, ew. [soft music] Carson, do you still have that stupid lighter? Oh yeah, here. [soft music] [lighter flicks] [Jake] There he is. Alec Windsor. "Burn three things he haunts with glee, "seal with a sacrifice to set him free. "If by midnight he inhabits thee, "your body he'll take for eternity." Do you think that's the antidote? Well, if a curse can be cast, maybe it can be retracted? Wait, so if it inhabits our body, it can keep it for... eternity? Yeah, no. This doesn't sound fun, apart from the superhuman strength. - [wind whistling] - [wind chimes chiming] Screw this. Let's get out of here. [Nightcrawler shrieking] [Kate screams] Shut the door! - [Nightcrawler growls] - [banging] [Nightcrawler shrieks] Okay, he's made out of plastic and polyester, right? - [growling and banging] - Carson give me your lighter! - Why? - Give me your lighter! Okay! Here. Everything's soggy down here! I need some kind of fuel. What? - [wood creaking] - [tense music] [group screams] - [crashing] - [Kate screams] - [Nightcrawler shrieks] - [group screams] - Ow, ow, ow! - [Kate screams] Go, go! Go, go! [tense music] [Bo groans] Bo! [Nightcrawler shrieks] [Nightcrawler roars] What are you doing? Come on! Trust me! Throw me the spray can! [tense music] [lighter flicks] Hey, Windsor! Are you made of lithium and tritium? 'Cause baby, you are lit! [flamethrower whooshes] [Bo yelling in slow motion] [Nightcrawler screams] - [dramatic music] - [light warbling] - Come on. - Come, Bo, come on. [dramatic music] - Bo, that was awesome. - Yeah Bo. Nice. Ladies and gentleman, chemistry. [Kate] Come on, let's get back to the hatch! [Bo] Race you to the top, Jake! [Carson] Last one out owes me five bucks. Oh, dang it! There is literally no way out! We're all gonna die in here. Well, Kate, at least we go down together. [Kate] You know I'm actually pretty impressed that you guys lasted this long. It's kind of legendary. [Carson] Thanks for noticing. [light warbling] [Alec] Those despicable, wretched brats! This will end tonight! [Alec shrieking in distance] [light whooshing] What? [distant shrieks] It's coming. And it's getting stronger. You know what? Enough running. We have to stop Windsor, for good. All right, Bo. Let's do this. No, no. No, I'm not doing whatever that is. [Together] Boo ya! [tense music] [SUV engine racing] "Burn three things he haunts with glee, seal with a sacrifice to set him free." We've already burned one thing. So, two more? "Sealed with a sacrifice" sounds like a ritual. Maybe we should burn three things together, just to be sure? What's the sacrifice? Like an animal? [Jake] No, no. It's more like something that means a lot to someone. Oh, it's like Carson's chest hair? [group laughs] Very funny. Here. "A sacrifice is often used to release a spirit from limbo. An offering of high importance that's different for everyone. For the hungry - food. For the poor - currency." For the grieving, a photo of their dad. [Kate] Carson. What did you just say? - Here, I have this. - Nothing. It was my grandmother's locket. Kate, dude. It's okay. Take it. You're the horror geek, so. - [tense music] - [light warbling] [dramatic music] Okay, what else did it possess? - The Fortune Teller! - Okay, I'll get it. [dramatic music] What's up? The necklace. It's gone. What? How? It was right here. Hey, we need to use something else. Jake, it's just a photo. Yeah, exactly. It's just a photo. Oh good, you got it! I couldn't find anything else. Kate, I lost your necklace. I'm so sorry. Jake, how? Jake has a photo with his dad. We can use that. Tell him, Bo. I mean, I don't know. Is there something else? Man the heck up for once and tell him he's the only one with something here to sacrifice. You don't know that! Everyone knows that! Jake, we need to at least try. Look, we're all sorry you lost your dad, dude, but at least you had one. Give it a rest, Carson! We're here now, alive. No thanks to you, by the way. [Bo] Carson, chill out! [Kate] Hey. Hey! Guys. This is ridiculous, you two. Stop, grow up! You act like you know everything, but you don't! Obsessing over gym freaks on your phone doesn't make you a grown up, Carson! Growing up means a lot of things you don't know jack about, like letting go of the past and accepting things change. Or having a darn opinion even when no one else likes it. Who knows, maybe growing up means growing apart. See you kids later. [Kate] Carson! You wanna know my opinion, Carson? Sure, Jake needs to stop avoiding change, but you need to stop forcing it! It's gonna happen, with or without you two fools interfering. So both of you grow up! [store items clattering] Just forget about him, we have to get this done. - [tense music] - [light warbling] [force field gongs] - [gentle music] - [clock ticking] [Bo] Okay, fortune teller's one, reaper's two, and teddy's three. We need the sacrifice. [gentle music] You should do it. [balls clattering] Who ah! [Kate grunts] Kate! [light warbling] [Kate gasps] Kate? - [thunder crashing] - [tense music] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go! [tense music] - [Kate growling] - [dramatic music building] [Alec groaning] - [Alec's voice] Jackpot! - [Alec laughs manically] Hi! [dramatic music] Your girlfriend is a little scary. [Carson] You mean my sister? Oh, so you're back to play with us kids? You guys are gonna need me. Let's move it. [tires screeching] - [lightning crackles] - What the hell? Oh baby, there you are. We don't have a sacrifice. Yes we do. The Encyclopedia of Shadows. It was a gift from my dad. Let's get that sucker back then. Only 10 minutes till midnight. Okay. For Kate. [dramatic music] [Alex laughing Maniacally] [clown laughs maniacally] [monsters laugh maniacally] Up there! Windsor's using her to control the monsters. [dramatic music] Okay, I have a plan. Carson, pull the creeps off. Bo, cover me. Jake, don't be stupid! - [dramatic music] - [monsters chattering] Yo, Dead Heads! Wanna dance? - [machine gun firing] - [Carson screams fiercely] [dramatic music] [monsters laughing and chattering] Hey Kate, you're not being very nice! [Alec's voice] Stop pestering me, you little twit! [dramatic music] [banging on window] Jake! Hello! Okay. - [dramatic music] - [monsters chattering] [darts whooshing by] Ah, no! [dramatic music] Stay back. [dramatic music] [clock ticking] Hey, you! Give it up, kid. I'm warning you! I get it! You want your old life back! But that body you're in belongs to my girlfriend! - [dramatic music] - [Kate screaming] I got it! Guys, now! [dramatic music] [clock ticking] - We need some more! - Got 'em! [dramatic music] [Kate screeching] No, no, no! [soft music] Jake! [Jake echoing] It's a family tradition. [Joanie] Mom says that's why you're mad all the time. [fire whooshing then crackling] [Alec's voice] No, no, no, no! [triumphant music] [whooshing] [clock tolls] [soft music] Like I said, couldn't you do something simpler like camp in the backyard? Backyard camping's for kids. Who ah, Jake. I love you, you're my hero, but that is never gonna happen. I'm your hero? [Kate laughs] Sure. [Kate] Ugh, what is that god-awful smell? Oh, it's Carson, it's singed hair. Yeah, Carson, we needed a sacrifice. [Bo] Yeah, took it while you were sleeping. Very funny, numbskulls. Best Halloween ever. [together] Boo ya! No, I'm still not saying it. [Kate laughs] Come on. Kate, maybe next year we throw our own Halloween party. One to outdo Ray Marino. [all laughing] Well, you'll be in high school, so maybe. Mom? - Jake! - [Jake] Mom? Oh, thank god you're okay. I was so worried. What in the world is going on? Why are you even out here? - What were you thinking? - Mom. You have all got a lot of explaining to do. It's my fault, Mrs. T. I'm sorry. Kate, it's fine. Mom, I'll explain everything. Just can I walk home with my friends? No. You know what? Okay. Sure. I'll see you at home. Jake, there's no way I'm turning down a ride. Do you mind, Mrs. T? Not at all. Let's get out of here. - Wait, guys, our bikes. - Leave 'em. [soft music] [Jake] Thanks, Dad. [soft music] Hey. Thank you, Jake, for everything. Okay, let's go home. [upbeat rock music on truck speakers] - [E-brake ratcheting] - [music stops] - [man whistling] - [keys jangling] Holy mother... [playful music] [kids chattering] You guys wanna do one last round for old time's sake? Trick or treating? Nah man, we gotta help Kate with the party. You still coming though, right? Absolutely. - [Joanie] Jake, I'm ready. - Oh my gosh. - [Bo] Have fun, dark princess. - [Carson] Better not be late. One last thing. Perfect. Shall we? Have fun, kids. [Frank] Oh, you look great, you look great. You look so good. Hey, hey. Thanks. I'm real proud of you. [soft music] All right, get going. Be safe, be safe. Have fun! [Sue] Home before dark! [soft music] - [tense music] - [water dripping] [Grandma G humming "Ring Around the Rosie"] Vos requiem. Ut... Vos requiem. Rest. Rest. Rest. - [whooshing] - [thunder rumbling] [tense music] ["Back to the House" by Space Capone] ["Heart Strings" by Bingx]
