My baby's a senior now. Su-jung's a high school senior already? I like Jin-tae's piano but can he keep it down? Can you hear it? But we spent a lot to soundproof his room. Putting egg cartons on the wall won't do. That's not soundproofing. Her room's just under his piano. You got plenty of rooms why study there? In-sook, I'm the landlord here. Su-jung's mom. Do you have no one else to vent to? That's harsh. Your lease's up in 3 months I'm raising the rent. Mrs. Hong, what's with you? You'll go to hell for this. For extra 10 grand, I won't mind. You got 3 months, rest is up to you. Where do I get that much money? Then move out. That's no pocket change. How am I supposed to get that! That's one shrew bitch. How come that booze-selling dumb bitch owns this place? Dumb ass bitch. Jesus. Su-jung, did you hear everything? She sells booze, so you're not wrong. But she's not dumb. At least she went to college, aviation major. Good night. Honey, what I meant was... Damn. Dang it. Dang it. Jin-tae, slow down. No! No! No more goals! Come on! This is so boring. Goal! - Having fun? - Yup. - Jin-tae? - Yup. Did you just look at my legs? - No peeking. - Yup. Have you ever had a girlfriend? - Never had a girlfriend? - Nope. Not even once? A crush or a girl you were madly in love with? You do! You do! You can tell me. Who is it? Hey. I'm so out of your league! How many times did I tell you? You want to marry me later? Yup. But agencies won't let talents get married. Yup. - Can't date either. - Yup. Yup, yup, I'm leaving. - Hey, Jin-tae. - Yup. Isn't my waistline awesome? - Not yours, mine! - My waistline.

Mr. Kim Jo-ha. Please help yourself. You are a habitual offender. How much have you made pulling scams? The police chief still comes by to mow my lawn. We're an important family. We're taking care of you instead of locking you up. Be grateful. Are you feeling okay? Virtue is like money don't waste it. - If you suffer any... - He jumped intentionally. Did I ask for money? You... What did you say? I'm not like that. I'm a fucking boxer. Look how scared you are. Goddammit... Where's the door? Dong-Su, look. Hi there. What brings you here? Do you know where Jo-ha is? Jo-ha? Useless bastard! What did he tell you? Not much. He was worried about you. Do you have a place to stay? What's it to you? Don't get me wrong. I just want to know how you're doing. Why do you want to know? Do I look like a bum without a place to go? Come in, this way. - Jin-tae. - Yup. I told you about him. This is your brother, Jo-ha. Yup. - Say hello. - Hello! - I am Jin-tae! - I am Jin-tae! He's your brother. I don't have a brother. Sit down, I'll fix you dinner. He's level 2 autism but he's so gentle and kind. People are surprised that he's autistic. He may seem weird but he'll never hurt a soul. Where do I stay? Right, you can use Jin-tae's room. He can sleep with me. He's been so excited to finally get a brother, he insisted that you use his room. Want some more? Should I pay rent? Hey, don't say that. Just feel at home, that's all. Do you think you'll feel weird here? What's weird about it? Free bed and free food. Sure, not like we're strangers... Give me some more. What the fuck? Where is it? Why are you here?

No headgear, he's free to do everything. But you'll die though. You skinny shit. - $200? 3 rounds? - Yeah! I'm doing you a favor. Okay? Fuck, bring them on. MMA or whatever. Good afternoon, sir. This is him, Kim Jo-ha. He was a welterweight Asian champion, WBC. He can cover middle to welterweight. Combination. - Good, that's fresh. - How is he? He's got speed. He looks a bit old though. How old? I'm 38... 40, actually. He's going through a rough patch lately but he normally maintains his body well! He has this quote... what was that? "Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion." Muhammad Ali. Do your best. The coach has huge influence. You could be a made man. This place is full of big bucks, soon you will... What's with this? You ready? Ready?

I wanted to meet you and apologize in person. How much? What? You came here because of your conscience. You accused me of being a scammer. Then you tossed me out. Let's not meet again. The poor people aren't your playthings. How much do you want? $1,500... I mean, $2,000. Fine. w w w . z o c i n e . c o m Watch Movies And Series! Excuse me. Yes? Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

I've seen enough. You got grit. Pardon? You got grit. I've never heard that phrase before. Us boxers live and die by grit, but not you. What do you mean by that? The rich, police chief, and such. They got even more grit. You mean 'luck', they got no grit. I felt like driving that night. You know, you feel like crap, and just hit the gas and go. For the first time since the accident, I wanted to drive, even though it was raining. I didn't have a destination, I just drove. Like a biker gang. Maybe I was thinking of Thelma & Louise's ending. The way they flew in the sky. But reality was different. You were the one who flew, not the car. Like this up in the air. I thought you died instead of me. I was a victim of a hit-and-run by a drunk driver. For good measure he ran my leg over twice. It had to be amputated. $2,000. Is that enough? Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion. Muhammad Ali Why don't you send Jin-tae here? The prize is $5,000. Take a look. Pianist Moon Sung-ki, the principal of Fryderyk, Korea's top piano school. He's heading this. Jin-tae's favorite pianist Han Ga-yul who placed 2nd at Chopin competition. Moon taught her. If he scouts Jin-tae his life is secured. Look, he's a savant. A musical genius. Does he have tantrum? Don't say that! He's like a sheep. He's an angel in front of the piano. He's so adorable when he plays. You can't keep him forever! Take a look. I have to, he's my baby. The 26th Fryderyk Piano Concours I get the signal lately whenever I eat. Take care of yourself. Medical exam came out fine. I just don't understand. I bet it's hypersensi-something. And you're okay? All I got are my health and my son. What about your check-up? They want me in but what's the point? I'm born healthy. I envy you. - Any good? - Yes. Jo-ha, if you're not busy tomorrow. Could you take him to the welfare center? I got an appointment so I can't. It's not far, just have to watch him. Sure. - You hear that? - What? Want some beef or noodles? Jin-tae? Jin-tae! - What is it? - He peed himself. What... Why's he pissing at the table? - Keep eating. - No, I'm done. Gosh. He can't even clean himself? No way. You just have to get him started. He can take care of the rest. He should be in a hospital. Why is he at home... - Are you scared of him? - Yup. - But happy to have a brother? - Yup. Ju In-sook! Ju In-sook! - Yes? - This way please. How is it living with your mom? It's temporary. I'll leave when I get my footing. Why should I stay there? Listen, free accommodation is hard to come by. You hit the jackpot be a good boy. Why should I? Crooked bastard. Why should I be good to that woman? She's still your mother, be respectful. Don't you know? She left me when I was a kid to start a new home and jail was my dad's home. I saw her on the street after I got out of the military. Then we met again. I grew up like an orphan. She's not a mom, just a random woman. You bastard. I'm sure she had her reasons. You told me over and over again. That he came home drunk and smashed shit up! She left because of all the beatings. What about me! Me! I was barely in middle school! What about me? Hey, I was... Goddammit, do I need to tell you every little detail? You're getting worked up? If you're going to act like this, then I'm going to leave, bastard. I got a cute girl waiting at home, I don't need to take this shit. Have a good night. You're home? Did you drink? Yeah. Why're you sleeping there? I waited for you, and fell asleep. Want some coffee? Right, it's too late for that. I'm going to leave when I get some money. Don't pretend to be so nice to me. It's uncomfortable. That's not my intention. I don't want to torment you or put you on a guilt trip. Let me stay in peace and leave. Do you still hate me? No, I don't even care. Let's just stay in peace. Sure, I want that too. Where's the welfare center? It's not far, near Junggye station. It's easy to find and close by. Only a few stops by bus. Buddy. Get over here! Toilet. Toilet. - What? - Toilet. Dammit. - Where do we go? Is it pee or poop? - Poop! You stupid bastard! We have to find a toilet. What are you doing? Where are you going? Dammit. Could you wrap it up? Poop faster! What are you doing?! Sir! Sir! Where's building 301? I finished pooping! - Dammit. - What? - He pooped. - I finished pooping. If he really had to go, he could've gone to a mall or ask to use the toilet at the security booth. How could he shit in the apartment complex? He'll get a misdemeanor fine. Fine is not good enough I can look past the drunk vomiters and pissers, but now a shitter too! Who will clean that up? Toss him in jail. Guardian? Yes. This is misdemeanor for public defecation. It's a $100 fine but I reduced it to $50. $50? That's hardly enough. What the hell did he do wrong? He had to go but couldn't find a toilet anywhere! Where should he poop then? Should he shit himself? Sir, you'll have to clean up his feces too. That's right, you bastard. Why the hell did you have to shit wherever! Why don't you answer your phone? Battery was dead. The welfare center called, you never showed up. Don't even mention it, today was hell... Where were you? Police station. What? Police station. What does he mean? It's nothing at all. This idiot... If you couldn't handle him why didn't you call? I was so worried sick. Couldn't you even think about me? Even if you're worthless how did he end up at the station? Worthless? Yeah, am I wrong? What kind of life are you living? Just how messed up are you? Jin-tae. Why did you go to the police station? I pooped at an apartment. You bitch. Die. Die. Going somewhere? Where's my knife? Where is it? Stop! Stop! Break it up! - Is he fucking nuts? - Hey... What did you say? You little shit! - That's enough! Stop. - Bastard. - Stop! Stop! - Hey. Stop... Don't. Don't do that! - Let go. - Stop! Let go. w w w . z o c i n e . c o m Watch Movies And Series! - Bastard. - Good evening. Shh... Slept here again? Yup. Hey, hey. Sleep here, come. Turn that light off. Idiot. - Wearing it to sleep? - Yup. Are you Iron Man? Why wear it all the time? It hurts. Where does it hurt? Hurts when I'm hit. Are you wearing it because of me? Yup. Put it away, it's stuffy. Yup. I won't hit you. Take that off. Sleep. Yup. - Hey. - Yup. - Aren't you hungry? - Yup. - Want some ramen? - Yup. - Got some? - Yup. Black Bean Noodle Hey, this isn't a Chinese Restaurant. - We only have black bean noodles? - Yup. Can you cook this? I'm a chef. Buddy. Cook quietly, don't wake up mom. Mom's not here. Not home yet? Nope. - When did you start piano? - 10. Do you like it? Yup, I like piano. A man should be boxing or driving and stuff. Pianos are for chicks. I'm a good driver. - You? - Yup. - With that? Game? - Yup. Of course you're good. Yup. It's hot, turn on the AC. Come on, give it. It's busted. Why didn't you say so! YOU WIN! YOU LOSE!! My car is good. - Switch cars. - Yup.

Remember In-chul? - In Canada? - Yeah. Of course I do, he's crazy. Gives up boxing, moves to Canada to teach Taekwondo. Life is so twisted. When he came by he asked me to work with him. Yeah? Want to move there? I'm just thinking about it. How much do I need to live there? Going one-way? On an airplane. You idiot. - I asked you going round trip or one-way? - Right, right. One-way, asshole. I know, so what? Plane ticket, moving costs, and even food. With you there tagging along that frugal bastard won't pay for much. You probably need at least... probably $5,000. $5,000? I made you dinner. I'll take care of it. Where did that idiot go? Su-Jung said she needed new shoes. Went shopping with her. She is his groupie. Listen. Jo-ha. I have a favor to ask. I'm hoping to enter Jin-tae in this piano contest. They got contests for that? But, he never had a formal training. He just listened and started playing. He can't read music and his phone is his teacher. He listens once and he can play. It's so amazing. That's what he does all day, he better be able to. Is that so? Now that he's an adult he has to look after himself. So what do you want from me? I wish I could take him to the contest, but I got some work in Busan. Busan? Yes. My diner is opening a branch and they need my help. They're paying double for just one month. - One month? - Yeah. Well... Take this and look after Jin-tae for a month. But if he wins you can have half of the prize. How much is that? $5,000. So $2,500. It's not much, just $1,000. Contest entrance fee and bus fare. I'll make enough dishes to last a month. Why not. Seriously? - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Why's he so late? Go to work, I'll look for him later. Yeah? Thanks. - You are a slut. - Stop it. A dirty slut. - Look at this bitch. - I've told you already. Slut, crazy bitch. Let me go. Buddy. I'm so sorry! Sorry. If you can punch my face in 3 minutes you get $10. Who are you? Me? I live with him. My brother! Jo-ha! Former WBC welterweight Asian champion. I smell bullshit. If you don't hit me you all pay $10 each. Here's mine. Put your money there. What are you doing? Bastard. Make a fist, asshole. Dammit. Let go of me, dammit. Bam! Counterpunch. No one has ever stood up to this. Is the time up? 3 minutes 11 seconds. 12 seconds. Gentlemen, pay up please. You win. Hey, Jo-ha. You're so cool, good boy. Shut it. Mom. Hello, Mrs. Hong. Where have you been? Go study. Please go. - Who is he? - My brother, Jo-ha. - You had a brother? - Yeah. - I didn't know. - Just go. - Stay quietly. I'm sensitive to noise. - Leave. You. Don't bark at your mom. Go home and study. Good bye. Don't mind her. She's raising me on her own by selling booze. It takes guts. She runs a host bar. Let's go. Sure. Jab, jab, jab... - Jab. - Jab. - Straight. - Straight. Yeah. When I say start, you try it. When I say start... Jab! - I didn't say start, idiot. - Jab. That was a jab. Okay, let's go again. Jab, jab. Jab, jab. You idiot. 10 bucks. It's so nice to dine out. I don't have to do anything. When's your train tomorrow? I can leave after breakfast. - Where in Busan? - It's near the beach. I'll take a photo. Should we take one too? That's embarrassing. No, we have no photos, I want to have one. Don't do that. - Excuse me? - Gosh. Yes? Could you take a photo of us too? Well, it's only for guests who are celebrating birthday. Are you celebrating one? I'll pay you. It's not a paid service, it's our policy... My birthday, mine. Pardon? It's my birthday. Could I check your ID? Sure. Right away, sir. Nuri? - Nuri. - Yes? Photo service. - Sir, happy birthday. - Excuse me. Here. Closer together. Closer please. One, two, three, say cheese.

That did it. Banging always works. Is that so? With music and wine feels like we're at a restaurant. You mean a wine bar. Jo-ha. Did you feel bad about last time? Stop it, I'm not like that. You... Did you resent me a lot? I wasn't pissed. Even if you did, I have nothing to say. I don't deserve to be a mother. I'm just thankful for you. Jo-ha. Take care of Jin-tae. He'll take care of himself. Even the strangers become a family when they eat and live together. He's a good kid. You'll like him. Don't say it like you'll be gone for a few years. It's only for a month. Even so. I got it.

Have a safe drive back. Back up. Jo-ha, who was that? Someone I know. The 26th Fryderyk Piano Concours Next up is ♪36, Jin-tae. Brother. Dammit. Jeez, what's he... Mr. Moon hates wasting time. Jin-tae's amazing. Everyone here says he did the best, he got the most applause too. If you see him, you'll know, Jin-tae, a piano champion. What? That's his name, what else should I call him? When did I call him an idiot? Anyway, when the result is out I'll let you know. When will you be back? Next week is 1 month. Is the work hard? You sound terrible. We eat way too much, don't worry and hurry back. We're stuffing ourselves. How many times do I need to say? Alright, I've got to go. We'll announce the winners and the grand prize. General division, 3rd place: Moon Yu-lim. Top three! Second place: Ko Joon-ki. Yes, you did it! First place, The 26th Fryderyk Piano Concours, Lee Ha-ram. Yes! First place! First place! - Don't worry, you're the grand prize. - Lee Ha-ram's the best. And today's grand prize, symbol of tradition and honor 26th Fryderyk Piano Competition. Grand prize! Jin-tae. High school division, Kim Gwang-ho. Gwang-ho! He didn't get it? My. - Congrats. - Congrats. Grand prize! - Congrats. - Yeah. Thank you for today, Mr. Moon. - Take care, sir. - Yes. It's been a while. Why was Jin-tae rejected? You know him? Strangely, his Chopin reminded me of you. Rhythm, tempo, dynamics, expression, and accuracy. Everything was perfect. But interpretation is crucial. How to creatively interpret a piece. You thought he didn't interpret it properly? Or he's not fit to stand on your stage? Sloppy, uncontrollable, and far from stylish. Because he can't be a star? You got a grudge. He's level 2 autism, he can't read music. He plays blind after watching YouTube clips. He understands the world through 88 keys on the piano. Every sound. This is a competition with fair conditions. Rich or poor, the age they start training, duration of training, they're all irrelevant. What if I told you he has never had a lesson. And that he was never taught the importance of interpretation. Prizes can't be taken back, but I've been curious what did I learn from you since I was 6. Jin-tae. I've been thinking about life a lot lately. When you meet someone you like your life will blossom. I wish I could look after you but I'll be so busy when I become a celebrity. I can't ask my agent to take care of you all the time. So... don't just rely on me and look for other girls too. Yup. Hey. You answered too fast. Shouldn't you think about it? You got a girlfriend? Han Ga-yul. - What's she like? - Piano. - She works at the center? - Han Ga-yul is pretty. - You cheated on me? - Yup. Fine. Eat shit with Han Ga-yul. Good bye. I don't fucking know. I have to go. Hey there. Is Su-Jung inside? Yes. How old? What for? Got a job? This and that, and workout too. So you do, you got a tight body. What is it? It didn't look like you work regularly, want a job? At your host bar? You're fast. Wait, it must've been Su-Jung. I'm not interested. We're hiring someone who could be Tarzan. It pays quite well. You'll have to take care of Jin-tae instead of your mom. Take care of who? I can barely take care of myself. In any case, call if you need money. Casa Blanca, Hong Hee-Kim Tarzan... I don't want it, come here. - Get paid to workout, nice? - Yup. Let's finish up quickly and go a round? Game, soccer game. I'll take Brazil, you can be North Korea. Thinking of mom? Miss her?
