Nice tune that, man! It's gonna bust a hole in the summer! If you don't know yet, this summer is going to be hot! DJ Bones and Paradise Radio are hosting the first event of the summer. And guess what! We're also going to have a big wave of tourists along the island so... All the tourists get ready! Look, there's a kid on the road! POLICE Slow down! Give the boy a tip! Thank you for that, man! 7 Gordons, plus 46 from last week... That's just over the 50 we need for the cassette tapes. But we still need some more to buy the microphone. That doesn't matter! By the weekend we'll have everything we need for DJ Bones to play them on the radio. How much do you think we can sell the tapes for? I don't know, but as long as a tourist discovers us, we good man. I guess. We'll have to practice this evening and see how we do. Let's try to sing good, with inspiration. Yeah, with love. To make the people fall in love with the sound, man. At least every time we get onstage, people connect with us. - Good morning, Corn! - Good morning! Corn! I've been looking for you all morning! Where were you? And why are you barefoot? Hi, good morning... Do me a favor and go upstairs to look for your sister. I need you two to pick up those benches. - Yes, ma'am. - Now look, I don't want no trouble. I know how you are... When you two start fighting it can get bad. Alright, Mom. - So we good... - All is cool... Get ready and call the boys... Where were you all morning? Your mother was looking for you. I just spoke to her. Where's Rita? Upstairs. He was so sexy. Yea, he was hot... very nice. When's the next one? I don't know. Hurry, girl, I gotta leave fast! - You look tired. - I am. - When does the catamaran arrive? - This evening. This evening? Yes, girl, you have to fix your hair. Touch it! See how it feels. - No boy is gonna like you with that hair. - I wanna look sexy! - Corn! - Please hurry! - I'm occupied! I'll be right there! - I have to go practice with the guys. I can't stand him! His songs are horrible! They're so convinced that their songs are good! What a shame! They make me laugh! They'll never get anywhere, you know? That's what you think about my music? Well, this is what I think of yours! Corn! Freaking little boy! Show some respect! I'm the oldest in this house! Boy! Cornelius! I'm coming down there and I'll break all your teeth! They're good today, man! - How dare you ruin my cassette like that? - Rita, what are you doing? He pulled the tape out of my cassette! - Corn, why did you do that? - I didn't even touch him! - I did nothing! - What do you mean "nothing"? OK, leave her alone! You're going to turn it against me now? Why are you believing her words? This morning she came in at 4 o'clock and you didn't say a thing! - What do you mean 4 o'clock? - I didn't come home at 4 o'clock! What time did you get here then? I was awake and it was 11 o'clock! You and I will talk later... And don't ask me for permission ever again. But I didn't get home at that time! Okay! We're a family and we have to live together. Put on your pants with this girl! I've had it with all of you! You two look at me now! Look at me now! You'll do as you're told! And I mean right now! Don't even think about it... Corn, please, I'm driving! Stop it! I'm driving! What the fuck? - Turn back, girl! - I told you to stop! Please! It means a lot to me! It was a birthday present! I'm not going back! Sometimes I wish I wasn't your brother! - What was it, Corn? - I don't know. What happened? What...? You wrecked the car. Corn, what happened? You wrecked the car, that's what! What do you mean? And that's not the worst part... Corn, what are we gonna do? It's a goat! A big, dead goat! Corn, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? We're going to fix this! How we gonna fix this, Corn? Help me! Do something! What do you want me to do? I don't have a solution! - We have to come up with a solution! - Listen to me! If you hadn't been playing that thing none of this would've happened! Help me lift up this goat! Help me! It's dead! Please, hurry! Stop shouting at me! Please! Why don't we just call Mom? Call Mom? Are you mad? She's very busy right now! The last thing she wants to hear is that we wrecked the car and need money! I know! I know! You don't need to remind me. Champ's brother has a place where they fix cars... Maybe we can fix it there. How are we going to fix the car if we don't have any money? We have a couple of hours before they start to suspect that something happened... So let's get moving. Right... What? - We'll push it! - Push what? Girl, come help me! What the heck are we gonna do with this? On the way to the shop we'll find some place to get rid of it. How? We can't just tie it to a rock and throw it to the bottom of the sea. I got this... get in the truck. One... Two... Three... - Class, what's going on? - Corn, how are you doing? - I'm good, what can I do for you? - I need a favor. Sure, what's up, man? My dad just bought a new car and he wants to keep this one as a second option but... I believe he wants to give it to me, you know? - But it's in a bad state so... - I can check it out for you. It's leaking oil! - Really? - Yea, man... We made it here without any trouble... I'll check it and see. - Hi, Rita, how's your day? - Hi... - Can you have it for tonight? - Tonight? I wanna show my dad some responsibility. Tonight is kind of complicated, man. You just have to reattach the bumper and fix the leak. We might have to bring some parts from the mainland and it could take a couple of days. - How much do you think this will cost me? - About 200 Gordons. 200 Gordons? Man, we're family! But it needs lots of work. I'll have to stop working on the others. - Alright, it's a deal then. - Alright, it's a deal. - What time can I come for it? - Come around 6 o'clock. Let's go. - Class, is that your bike? - Yea, it's mine. Can I borrow it to go get the money? I'll bring it back with a full tank. - Alright, but take care of it. - Sure, man. Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm thinking. Well if you're gonna think, let me get down. This is stupid. Why did you lie to Class? We can't go around the island telling everyone we killed a goat. It's bad juju. Is that salt on you? - Where? - You're jinxed! Everything you were trying to avoid is all over you now. This is no time to be fooling around, girl. Crab patties! Two Gordons! Please buy one for me! I only have one... Thanks. Than... Corn, why did you do that? Please, man, I'm hungry. I don't care if you're hungry. I never got to finish mine this morning. And I'm making you pay for losing my harmonica. You're really gonna bring that up now? Alright, let's go. We have to pick up those benches before they call home. I've got it! We'll sell the meat to the butcher. Help me! Good morning. - What's up? - I want to sell you some meat. - But I sell meat... - I know, but I have a good deal for you. She looks good! It's a "he"... Alright, bring it in. I'll enjoy skinning it. This goat is dead! No, we gave him a pill so we could bring him on the bike. He's kind of aggressive. What kind of pill? The pills my mom takes for her headaches... We gave him one so he could relax a bit, sleep for a few hours. Plenty of hours. This goat is marked! That mark is... It's the mark from my papa's farm! - Your papa doesn't want it? - Yes, but our freezer's full... So if he kills it, the meat would spoil. How much do you want for it? 500... 500? Are you mad? Excuse me, sir... My sister got a sunburn and she's not thinking straight. Damn you! I'll give you 50... You can double that in less than an hour! Besides, the tourist season is around the corner... Give me 75 and I keep the skin. Alright... it's a deal. Deal. I'll wait for you in front. Where are we going? Brother Corn! My friend! - Rainbow! - Everything's good? Everything's good, man. Wonderful song! - We're working on a new song. - Very nice, man! - Never easy, you know. - I know, man. - How you coming? - I'm making progress... - Yea? - Yea, man! - How's the music? - The music's well... - I wanna play like you some day. - Like me? I'm recording some tapes for the tourists, man. - Keep up the good work then. - Yes, man, that's the idea. - So are you guys hungry? - Yes, I'm hungry. - Let's go inside and get something to eat. - Yea. This is a good place to chill. We come here and keep the spiritual vibes going... Yeah man, I know that. Get comfy here. Wow, nice place! - You like it? - Just like I remember it. I'm happy you say that. My home is your home. Careful with the bowl. It's kind of hot... Miss Lady... - Try it! - Nice! So, I got a good deal for you. What's up? My dad killed a goat this morning and I remember you said your drum had a couple of holes... So I feel this goat skin will suit you. OK, wait here... Drink the soup, let me see what I have. All we have here are things we find on the beach. Things that the tourists leave behind... This is what I have. I use this to record some of my music... - Wow! - We'll take the watch. - But this looks a lot better. - We'll take the watch. It's a Rolex! Nobody wants to hear about Creole Vibrations, you know. It's misleading to think about material things, you know? It's not good for the soul. Tell my dad that... Brother Rainbow... Sorry, but my sister is a material girl. I'm really sorry, excuse me. It's cool, just be patient with her. Thank you, man. It's great to see you! You too, man! Brother Corn! Wait there, man! We don't need this part... We don't do black magic or anything like that. Alright then! Girl! Hey! I'm talking to you! Are you crazy? You just embarrassed me in front of Rainbow. Fool, do you know how much this costs? We can sell it! DJ Bones here on Port Paradise! In other news, Mr. Lucius just came back from fishing. So if anybody wants to eat fresh lobster here in Port Paradise, check Mr. Lucius. And Miss Pauline Denton called a while ago and she told me to let her kids know that food is ready so... Denton kids! Back to your home! That's really funny, Boss. How could a goat get so far in such a short time? I've never heard of that happening before. I don't want to talk about it. Let me tell you something... If I catch whoever stole my goat, I'll skin him alive. And with his skin, I'll make a damn drum with it and beat it till it breaks. I'm sure you will, Boss. Is that my goat? Good evening. You better have something good for me today. We have. Do you have any paper or receipt that shows ownership? No, my dad found it while diving. He gave it to me for my 15th birthday. Well, young lady, without papers I have to be careful... The police comes by every 15th and last day of the month. So all I can give you is 200. Nice! That will take us out of this problem. Shut your mouth! 200? Are you serious? 175. Sir! That is a Rolex! 150. - We need more! - 125. - We need more than that! - 100. - Take it, girl! - Shut your mouth. You're not gonna find that anywhere else, you know. 75... and that's my last price. Someone else will buy it at a better price. Corn, let's go. - Why didn't you take it! - I know what I'm doing! It would've solved this problem! - You're too greedy! - You're the one who's greedy! It's me who's doing this business, not you! - What do you know about business, anyhow? - Shut your mouth! But you don't know how to do business! I'm gonna finish this myself! Mister, please restart the time. Please give us a good price! Let me tell you something, young lady... No one turns back time. - No way. - At least 100. 75. - 90! - 75. What the hell is this? 76. OK, I think I can give you 76. I'll pay you 76. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 76. - Are you mad or what? - It's mine! You wanna get us into more trouble? Let's go! 110... 120... 130... 140... 145... 150... And 151. We're 49 short. Corn, we're 49 short! - I heard you the first time. - It doesn't look like it! You owe Class money. How are you going to pay him? That's right! Go ahead and ignore me! As if we didn't have anything better to do! Corn, we need that money! Where are we gonna get it? The money isn't important right now. Corn, we need that money! Aren't you going to pick it up? Don't tell me you believe in supernatural nonsense! It's not nonsense! Show some respect! Why did you steal it back then? Play the thing! No! You're too old to believe in that stuff! Play it! It's mine and I'll decide when to play it! Play the thing! You wanna kill another goat? Play it! We need to get that car moving. How's Dad going to pick up the tourists without it? You forgot the money! - Give me the money! - Why? What do you mean "why"? Take one bill! Give it to me! You're too damn mean! Good morning, Denton Hotel... This is Miss Pauline talking... Can I help you? Your kids haven't shown up yet. And I don't have the whole day. How so? They've been gone a long time, man! I cannot wait any longer. Okay, I'll see what I can do. - Give me some money to pay for gas. - I'm going to the bathroom first. - Miss, can I have 10 Gordons of gas? - Okay. - Can I use the bathroom? - Go right ahead. Listeners, today we have a full moon... So if anybody has a little debt with the ghoul, today is a good day to pay it back. This is DJ Bones, baby! Thanks. Corn! Of all the goats on this island, you had to kill mine! That goat is my sister's! I have nothing to do with it! - I don't believe you! - It's the truth! I saw the head! I'm going to tie you up on the shrine and let the ghoul carry you away! - Help! - Stop making noise, boy! The ghoul likes little boys like you who mess around with the wrong people. Please let me go! I don't care about that. Shut your mouth or I'll cut out your tongue! Put him up there by the shrine! Officer Bold, I just saw Rita Denton! She just passed by here! Roger that, Officer Livingston. Don't let her get away, you know? She will lead us to that little thief. Rita Denton, pull to the side! Talk to me! Officer Livingston? Where are you? You copy? Rita Denton, pull over to the side! Officer Livingston, you caught her? Talk to me! - No, please, I can't stop! - Come here, Rita! I need to look for my brother! Your mother needs you! She's been calling the station every 10 minutes! - Let me go! - You have to get in! I have to look for my brother! - Where's your brother! - I don't know, but please let me go! I can't let you go, Rita. - Please let me go! - I can't leave you. Officer Bold, please come pick up Rita Denton's motorcycle. OK! Roger that. That's goods news. I'm close by. I will pick it up! Over and out! Rita... I'll put you in this place here. Sit down here, your mother's on the way, okay? Officer Livingston is looking for your brother. Port Paradise Police Department, this is Officer Bold... Officer, someone tied up a boy by the peak. - A boy is tied up on the peak? - Yeah, some thugs put him up there. - What are you talking about? - I'm being serious! Stop fooling around and find something to do! These fools have no respect! Who was that, Officer? It's none of your business! What happened now? Oh, come on! - Something happened to it? - Just lost the signal... Do you have access to the roof? - Yes... - That could be the solution. I'll be back, okay? Rita! Dammit! Corn! Corn, Rita... welcome. I heard you've had a long day... I see you bring my goat head... I just got out of the police station... They're looking for us. Corn... Let me see. I hate you! You put me into this problem! I nearly died because of you! Look who's paying for this! - Corn... - It's all your fault! Get out of this problem yourself! I'm not your brother anymore! Champ! I'm gonna take a leak... What are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you! Me and Corn got into a problem and we need your help. Where is he? I don't have time to explain. Just come with me... please. This will do. Why are you doing this? Corn... killed a goat. Right now he's hiding and I don't know where exactly. And he needs my help. And you're doing all this for your brother? - Why not? - I thought you didn't like him. Why do you say that? Because he told me that you never liked him. - Did he really say that? - Yes. Come. - Hurry, Champ! - I'm glad you're doing this for Corn. - Any idea where he's at? - The stadium... He goes there when things get bad. Hey, Champ! Goddamn you, Champ! Corny... Corn... Why won't you talk to me? Corn, please... I need you! Remember the day they canceled school because the volcano became active? That never really happened. You think I'm a fool? I saw the smoke! I know but... Dora and I went up there that morning with two tires and burned them up. Seriously? Yeah... We spent all night painting our nails and didn't have time to study for the exam. Well... you saved me too because I spent all night practicing with the boys. This is all I could get... I've got this, too. But it's not enough! What are we gonna do? Right now we need a home run. But with what? The cock fights! You can't come in here. - Why? - You're underage! But I'm 18! You might be 18, but she's not! What do you mean? I'm older than him! - So show me your ID! - I didn't bring it! Then there's nothing we can do. Let me tell you something... I'm pretty sure your boss wouldn't be very happy if he found out we couldn't get in to bet! Show me what you got! - If I give you 50 will you let us in? - Anything you say. So that's the way it is! You like money! Yea, go on inside... That's the guy who kidnapped me! Let me take care of this. Check the cock's spurs! You can run and hide from me, but not from the ghoul! He'll find you! Just wait and see! Corn, you broke my confidence! I worked on your car all day and you never showed up. What happened? Sorry, man... It's been a long day. I could've fixed somebody else's car instead! We're sorry but I have the cash right here. I already got it from your mom and she didn't look too happy about it. - Excuse me, but... - Just take your head... I have somewhere to go, man. There he is! That was good, man! Yeah, that was excellent. What did that bird taste like? At least I got close to it, unlike you, you little chicken. So close and you couldn't even get 1 Gordon out of it. At least I saved your ass! Thank you. What do you wanna do with that? It stinks. It's the only evidence we have to prove what happened today. Whatever... keep it then. We really had bad luck today. At least we solved this problem. But I still feel like we're missing something... - You're gonna have to trust me now! - Cornelius! At least wait for me! Come on, Corn, try harder! That's what I'm doing! Corn, what are we doing? I'm tired and I wanna go home! Why do you still have that thing? - Because I have a debt. - With who? - With the ghoul. - He doesn't exist! Why do you think I'm attracting such bad luck with my music? Corn, your music is good! You're made for that! And I promise I'm not just saying that because I wanna go home... Just throw it away! Yes! Throw it away! Throw it! That's what's been bringing us bad luck all day! That's why we're stuck in this damn boat! Just throw it away! Throw it! Don't worry about it anymore. Look how far we got, just you and me. Without nobody's help! Come on, let's go. I can't believe that! Was it real? At least the car looks good. Yeah, but they're gonna punish us for a lifetime! Ready or what? Cornelius and Rita Denton! Where the hell have you been?
