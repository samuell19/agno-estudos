My name's Matt and this is my first session or meeting or whatever we call this thing I've not really given much thought about what I'm gonna say I suppose that's why I'm here to think, talk through how I'm feeling maybe, share my experience I'm 24 years old, I'm a mechanic, I live with my mum and dad just outside Glasgow. I've got a little brother and a dog, cult cooper. Life seemed pretty basic, pretty basic No dramas until a couple of weeks ago when I was... when I was raped. It's...it's hard... I've thought long and hard about what happened to me and why it happened and part of me strong denial, ashamed, maybe my fault My friends and my family don't know I tried to hide it from them, but but things my girlfriend kind of went so worn I just hit rock bottom I felt I wasn't good enough for her anymore I felt I'd let her down. So, so was my best pal's 21st. We've been out to the football and then we hit the town. I...I had a few too many, too many pubs. I lost my pals, the battery my phone had died... so I just walked home and I tried to flag down a taxi, but I mean, they must have taken one look at the state of me and thought twice. I cut through the park, it started raining pretty heavily. My feet were just covered in mud. So, I go back to the road I stand under a bus shuttle just to dry off a bit and that's when a car pulled over. I remember these lights, these blending white lights... So I got in the back thinking it was a taxi, even smelled like a taxi. I don't even remember telling him my address The music was something sleepy and I could tell from the back of the guy's head, he was about 40, but that's...that's where the beer goggles on so I couldn't say precisely. Then I threw up all over my jeans and all over the side of the door. Before I knew it the car was pulled over, my belt was unbuckled, jeans on my knees and I didn't even try to stop him I didn't even question it I was just... just paralyzed with the drink but the shock after he went down there I remember my face being pushed down, my face was right in at the carpet and and it happened. I couldn't see anything at that point, but the pain was... I was left at the side of the road and then after a couple minutes I managed to get back to my feet and I figured out my bearings I just walked straight home, straight in, straight to bed just shut my eyes like... just like I don't been in a bad dream. And the morning came as quick as the night it went I laid in the bath, I could hear my little brother kicking his football off the garage door and just every rattle became unbearable So I dried off and i put on the mask like... like nothing had happened. That was my little secret I didn't tell a soul, I didn't want to acknowledge it I kept beating myself up over why I didn't try and stop him I mean, did i say something to provoke him? Was I asking for it? I've just a million thoughts just running right through my head I 'm not gay or am I? I mean did I enjoy it? Was there a part of me that liked it? I was...I couldn't... I couldn't reason with myself Yes. So after a couple days, my girlfriend, she sensed that something was off. I didn't want to have sex, I couldn't look her in the eye anymore. So one night I texted her I told her it was over and then I just...I just withdrew. Stopped going to work, I ignored my pals. I just locked myself away in...in shame And most nights I'd replay in my head what happened just over and over and over I then became obsessed I was questioning my sexuality a lot I'm here today because well, because I don't want to just keep this in my head anymore I thought that by saying things out loud it would make it easier and I feel it, you know, the relief Hearing some of you talk today it's given me a whole new perspective, all new mind set. What happened to me doesn't define who I am, doesn't make me any less of a man or a friend or a brother or a son. How was this? I was raped This is...uh... There's a saying I'd done I love my life bias everything happens for a reason I'm not so sure anymore
