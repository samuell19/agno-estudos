Are those actors masochists? Is sex politics? When you release your latest film, The 120 Days of Sodom, do you believe that it will scandalize again? Why are you no longer a militant today?

Mine is not a tale, it is a parable. The meaning of this parable is the relationship of an author to the form he creates. Andrea Fago, "the man who eats," as usual, took the Alitalia DCQ, destination Cape Town, on an ordinary spring afternoon. There should have been a few hours of a peaceful and wonderful flight. First, Egypt- With the Nile, with its green trees, with its palm trees and cereal fields, and its dark ochre villages. And then Sudan, with its endless southern desert, wonderfully pink.

What lends a foreboding feeling to that desert is the fact that it's not a desert but an enormous empty country forgotten by God and by man. And it was in the middle of that desert that the Alitalia DC9 crashed. Everything I'm going to tell you appeared not in the theatre of the world but in the theatre of my mind. It took place not in the space of reality but in the space of my imagination. Is finally resolved not according to the contradictory rules of the game of existence but to the contradictory rules of the game of my reason. The Messiah is born! The Messiah is here!

What about you? - What? - Then why are you here? I just do it for the money. This is the most free city in the world. The city of lesbians and gays. And tonight is their big celebration. - Do you want to come? - What's it gonna cost? You're with me, it's free. Come on. What is this place? The feast of the fertility. This is an important feast for this city. Here in Sodom, during the year, the gays stick with the gays and the lesbians with the lesbians. But on this one day, they come together to procreate the race. And after today, they go their separate ways, the lesbians with lesbians and the gays go back to... - The gays go back... - To the gays.
