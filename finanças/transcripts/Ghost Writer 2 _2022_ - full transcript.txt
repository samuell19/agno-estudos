A FILM BY MUHADKLY ACHO Why's your revision like this, Nay? I told you, please follow what the client wants. But sir, I was just trying to make the campaign less corny. Nay, our client is corny. Just do what they want. It's faster. Don't be afraid! I'm Tiger. Give me coffee! What did he say? He's a tiger. He wants coffee. Coffee? Don't panic! Don't panic! Coffee! Nay! Help. Cahyadi got possessed. He's asking for some coffee. I've told you many times, I'm not a shaman. But you wrote a book with a ghost. What are you saying? No way. I'm having a meeting with Mr. Stevan. Nay, you take care of this. - Nisa can take over your work. - Yes. Nis, come with me. Nay, where are you going? I'm going home. My work got taken over. What about this? Help us! He wants coffee, right? Just give him coffee. Huh? Come again? Here. It's bitter, dammit! You ungrateful tiger! - Johan... - No, let me go! What's going on, bro? What's going on? There was a tiger! Where? It was you! I'm Cahyadi, bro. Cahyadi. Look at your tiger claws! TRUE STORY. A BEST-SELLER INDEED. SINCE WHEN DID NAYA BECOME SO SHALLOW? A SHAMAN WITH A LAPTOP CAN WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THIS AUTHOR'S ONLY LOOKING FOR SENSATION. Whoa, it's been a year. Naya's novel is still a best-seller. I'm disappointed. It feels like a cheap horror story. Maybe she wants to go viral? Smarty-pants. They think it's easy to write. Don't listen to them. Your book is great. A best seller, and you get enough royalty, right? True, but that's temporary. The image as a shaman, it lasts a lifetime. I want to be like her. After 20 years, her work still gets reprinted. Amazing, you know? When can I be an author like her? First of all, you too are amazing. Secondly, your writings are good too. But everything takes a process, Nay. Trust me, when Kirana Widuri started writing, she wasn't this great. I bet she too had some corny moments. So, I'm a corny writer now? That's the amazing thing about you. Your corniness is elegant. But actually, I'm starting a new story. Really? I sent the synopsis to Mr. Alvin. I hope he approves it. What's it about? Tell me. About everything that happens in this world must at least have two sides. Like, when we experience loss, at that time, we gain something too. And the other way around. How everything is actually about chaos and cosmos. Cosmos? Magic jar? What do you mean "magic jar"? Just kidding. But sounds like it will be awesome. Sounds philosophical. Hey, what about your movie preparation? Wow, it's exciting. Totally exciting. And you know what? I'm going to have this dangerous scene. Jumping from one building to another. - Do you know who I'll jump with? - Who? Doni Alamsyah. - Seriously? - Seriously. Totally awesome. But aren't you afraid? Actually... I'm more afraid of us being separated, Nay. Please, stop with the soap opera act. You're in a movie production now. Right, focus. Mr. Alvin texts me. Huh? He asks me when can I come to the publisher office. Ms. Broto wants to talk to me. Alright! You're gonna write about a magic jar. Oh, good. I thought you're talking to someone. Talking? With your friend, who helped you with your novel. - Oh, Galih. - Gosh. Don't mention him. He might appear. Come. Ms. Broto has been waiting. I'm worried if we're late... Dammit! Do you have to appear like that? Sorry, I'm trying to get into character. It's unusual for you to ask for a meeting this late. I asked you last week at noon, you were busy. Oh, right. Last week, I was moving out. Why? Well, I found a place near my office. Oh, right. We're doing night shift here, preparing for our office's anniversary. We have an anthology project. Oh, really? Who's the writer featured this year? Kirana Widuri. She's my favorite writer. So, that's how it is? So, now your favorite is Kirana Widuri? Okay, I'm fine. What's wrong with you? - Why did you say that? - You started it. - What? - You said your favorite is Kirana Widuri. Alright, Kirana Widuri's my number two. Who's the number one in my heart? You. I know. Hello? Excuse me? I'm still here. Can't you reschedule this boyfriend-girlfriend thing? Excuse me. Girlfriend? Fianc√©! - You two are engaged? - Of course. - Congratulations. - The wedding's in three months. Please come. I will. A best-seller author and a famous actor, the wedding will be grand. - Of course. - No. What Naya and I meant was... A grand or a small wedding is a matter of scale, relative. Right. How many guests will you invite? - A thousand. - One hundred. You two are marrying each other, right? In the same building? The point is, I want a simple reception. We'll invite close relatives only. Right, Vin? Is that so? Jer, please get us some drinks. - What's wrong? - I don't know, sir. My neck is stiff. Luckily, Ms. Naya's here. Miss, please read my psychic. I'm afraid something sticks to me. Sticks to you? Maybe a ghost is sitting on my shoulder. I'm sorry, I'm just a writer. Excuse me. Nay! Nay, hey. What did you see? No, I'm fine. Dul, it must be depressing being a paranormal, have a sixth sense, able to see ghosts and stuff. She must be scared. Isn't it fun to communicate with ghosts? Why would you want to communicate with ghosts? Well, for networking. - Maybe one day you'll need their help. - Huh? Look at Ms. Naya. Her novel became a best-seller with the help of a ghost. Right, miss? A best-seller. It's a different case. The ghost didn't help Ms. Naya. She helped the ghost. Thanks to Ms. Naya, that ghost can move on peacefully to the next world. Didn't you read the novel? You should read it! There's no such thing as ghosts helping humans. Of course there is. In the Roro Jonggrang tale, who made those 1,000 temples? The house improvement team? The ghosts, of course. You don't know your history. Read more. Have you seen that apparition video at the wafer factory? - There's a video? - There is. - Seriously? - Seriously. - Here. It went viral. - Is it scary? - So scary! - Should we continue? - Should we continue? - No! Let's watch cat videos. Nay, come in. Yes, sir. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi. Just a second. I'm feeding Rudi and Marwan. They'll get an ulcer if they eat late. Hey, what are you doing here? Oh, I thought I was allowed to come in too. Sorry. - I'll wait outside. - Hey. You're a celebrity, right? Yes. An actor, ma'am. A TV film star. That's right. What was the title? Antique Marmot. I wasn't a part of that title, ma'am. Oh! My In-laws Blocked My Love. Also no. My Nephews Blocked My Love? - No. - Uncle? - Also no. - Then, who blocked your love? None of my productions has "block" in their titles. My latest TV film was quite famous. It's called, Mashed Potatoes of Love. I haven't watched it. But it's alright. Let's take a picture. A picture? Alright. - Me too? - No. Why would I need you? - Let's take a picture together. - Okay. If one day you become famous, I'll already have your picture. - Alright? - Yes. Like this, people can see that we've been close for long. - There. - Okay. Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome, ma'am. So, how is it, Nay? When will you finish your horror novel? Don't miss the moment. What about that synopsis I sent you? That won't sell, Nay. It has no horror element. We tried to work with another horror writer. - What was the title? - No good. Skinny Horse Ghost. There. I think people prefer true stories. - Personal experiences, more authentic. - Yes. Like your previous work, Ghost Writer. Haven't you found another ghost? Any ghost? Oh, tell you what. Spend a night at a villa next to a graveyard. - Can she do that? - Yes, or she can rent the whole graveyard. You can choose a Chinese graveyard, a Dutch graveyard. Different cultures. Right, ma'am? - The Chinese one is cute. - Of course, the Chinese are cute. Or maybe you can spend seven days and seven nights inside an ambulance. Or you can get buried alive with seven corpses. Or get dressed as a banshee? Or sleep under the painting of Lady Roro Kidul? I know a guy who can summon a saggy female ghost... No! Sorry, ma'am, sir. I really don't want to have anything to do with the ghost world anymore. If people don't like my writings, that's okay, but if people only see me as a shaman, what's the point of me writing? We still have an exclusive contract. Three books. I know, ma'am. And... I'm still a writer, but I want to write properly. Okay, look, ma'am. I heard you're working on an anthology project with Kirana Widuri. How about you give me a chance to join that project? So I can prove to you that I can be a serious writer. If the result is not satisfying, I'll do what you want and write ghost stories. Yes, but for that anthology project, the script submission deadline is less than a month. - Meanwhile... - I can do it, sir. The team and us will think about it. Alvin will contact you. Darto? Darto? To? - Sis Naya! - Darto! Help! - Sis Naya, help! - Darto? Aw, sis. Now, we have to retake the shot. Hi, sis. What are you doing, making scary videos? We all know you're cowards. To become famous, sis. Does it have to be ghost content? At first, we wanted to focus on song covers, but we didn't get enough views because Billy's voice's bad. I was playing the guitar, To. Well, next time, just stand still. Don't do anything. Yes, bro, sorry. But when we said that we're Darto and Billy from Ghost Writer, we got a lot of viewers. We got a lot of comments too. - They even asked for a re-enactment. - That's right. Is it that important, being famous? It's important, sis. You're weird because you don't want to be famous. Right? Yes, weird. Not that weird. You just don't know the consequence, To. Not all dreams feel good when they come true. Don't use my face on your YouTube channel. Alright, I'm leaving. Wait. Do you have any new stock? Yes, bro. It's been a while. Share some with us. What stock? Huh? - What? - Porn. Goodness. Your brain, Bill. I gave you one, To. They were just swimsuit models. - You can find a lot at Ancol beach. - So? The ones with costumes. Nurses. That's right, bro. With handcuffs. What handcuffs? Convicts? Hush! Listen. I don't know who you are and what you want, but one thing is for sure. I don't care. I'm not afraid! Vino! Vin! What's wrong, Nay? - What? - Nothing. It's nothing. - Did you just see a ghost? - No. No, the door was stuck. It's fine. I said it "was" stuck. What's with your desk? No, I was just... tidying some stuff. Are you sure you're alright? I'm alright. Okay. Vin. Yesterday, I sent your mom a WhatsApp message, asking her about the invitation list, but she just read it. Be honest. Has she accepted me or not? Come on. Don't think about that. Just relax. Let me take care of things. It's all good. Okay? Okay. Alright, I have a film to shoot. Don't forget to eat. Alright. If I don't eat, I'll die. - Take care. - Bye. Nay. Cahyadi was cured from the possession after you told us to give him coffee. Can coffee cure possession? How should I know? Why won't you share with us some of your knowledge? Hello. Mr. Alvin. Huh? Seriously? I can join the anthology project with Kirana Widuri? Alright, sir. Thank you. You're going to write with Kirana Widuri? - Yes. - Oh. Kirana Widuri writes horror stories now? No, I'll be writing a serious script. Just watch. I'll write something important and memorable. Come on. You should just write, Possession-Free Health Tips, by Naya Enezia. And then, Cahyadi as a tiger can be on the cover. Right. Morning, sir. Vin. You always come home in the morning. It's unusual for you to come this early. If I come here at night, will you be here? Vin. Are you sure you want to marry Naya? Mom. Please. We agreed not to discuss this again. I'm tired after my film shoot. Give this to Naya. This... Are you really giving this to Naya? I'm just following our family's tradition. Mom. Thank you. - Hi. - Did you change the venue we booked? The wedding organizer said they've found a new venue for 1,000 people. Well... Wouldn't it be better if we add a little? One hundred to 1,000 is not a little addition. That's ten times! We agreed to have a small reception. I know we agreed on this. That's why, listen... You listen to me! Come on, Nay! You want to make a fuss about this? I'll pay for the additional guests! Is that so? - Wow. - No, I didn't mean that, honey. Nay. Naya! Nay! - Nay. - What is it? I'm sorry. What I said was wrong. But look on the bright side. No. I think we need to rethink. About the wedding. Nay. Naya! Naya. Nay. Naya! I'm getting some rest. This is my waiting area. They got me some coffee, tea, fruit. Nice, right? - It won't be long. - Bro. What's up, bro? You'll have to jump on your own, without any stuntman. No, I'm not doing that. It's not in my contract! But the director said you'd do it. No, I won't. Stupid director! - Bro Donny. - Hey, bro. - How are you? - I'm good. What's up? For our next scene, you'll have to jump yourself, no stuntman. All good. No problem. - But you said... - I didn't say anything. - All good? - All good. Look at him. A true action movie star. All good, bro. Actually, I got a stuntman, but he is sick. What was it again? Hemorrhoids, bro. - Is it bad? - It's bad. It looks like this. It's alright. Let me do it. Alright. Go and prepare everything. Mance, make-up! Mr. Donny. Let me do your make-up. Vin, you look so down. No, I'm fine. By the way, am I invited to your wedding? You're invited. If the wedding is on. Dimas! - What are you waiting for? - Oh, this. Vino's harness is too small. I'll have to grab another from the office. How long will that take? - Around an hour, bro. - Gosh. What about Donny's? - Donny's all good. - Okay, tell you what. Vin, you don't have to jump. Let Donny do it. I only need the main actor's shot. Bro, sorry, but wouldn't it be weird if my character doesn't jump also? I know it would, but what else can we do? I can't waste another hour. We still have a lot of scenes. Bro, let me jump without a harness. It's alright. The gap is small. No, no. If anything happens to you, it'll be my responsibility. I promise I won't sue you if anything happens. It's all good. Dimas can be our witness. Help me out, bro. All good, bro. Dimas and I are good. Are you sure? I'm sure. But it's your responsibility, okay? Yes, alright. Fine. Take the shot, Dim. - Yes, bro. - Thank you, bro. That's not what I meant, honey. Naya... Nay. INCOMING CALL - NAYA Get ready! Slate 123, scene 30, take one. Okay, stand by! Concentrate, everyone. Three, two, one, action! - Hey! - Oh no! - Get away! - Hey! ONLY FOR EMERGENCY PATIENTS Vino! No, don't leave me! Vino, Mommy's here. Anna. You have to let him go. Let him go, dear. Come, Anna. - Thank you, Siska. - Anytime. Ma'am. My deepest condolences. ALVIN - HOW ARE YOU? IWAN - ARE YOU WELL? Sis. Anna, calm down. Did you call me? Is Naya okay, Vin? I think she's fine, ma'am. What's wrong? Why hasn't she liked my photo with Vino? I even tagged her. Well, she still needs time to mourn, ma'am. True. Or perhaps my post is the only one she hasn't liked. Well, it's her Instagram. I'm not the admin. - You have a point. - Right? Hey. - Yes, ma'am? - About this. About the anthology project. Please ask Naya whether she still wants to continue or not. Let me follow up with Naya about the anthology project. - Yes. - Alright, ma'am. Vin. - What else, ma'am? - I see that you too haven't loved my post. You haven't liked it. Okay, let me like it now. There. I liked it, left a comment, and reported it as spam. Thank you, ma'am. Hey! Reported it as spam? Twelve likes. Nay, why are you working? Because I get paid here. I know, but you're still mourning. You can work from home instead of forcing yourself like this. You'll get even sadder. I've mourned enough. MISTER ALVIN - Hello, Mr. Alvin. - Hello, Nay. Sorry for bothering you in your condition. Can we talk for a moment? It's alright. What is it, sir? It's Ms. Broto. She asked me to ask you. Are you still joining the anthology project? Of course, sir. I've collected some ideas. I'll email them to you for us to discuss. Great. I'll be waiting. Keep in touch. Where should I put this? Wait. I'll put this here. Sis, you know what? When it rains like this, it reminds me of... Vino! Sis, Vino is here! Quit messing around, To. It's true, sis. I saw him there. - What are you saying? - I swear, I just saw Vino. - Nobody's there. - He's there. He's there, sis! Stop messing around. Vino's gone. Get up. I think you can see me if you touch Naya, To. What? Ask her why won't she say anything? Sis. He's asked, "Why won't you say anything?" - Vin. - Yes, honey? "Yes, honey?" Why did you have to die first? - "Why did you have to die first?" - No need to repeat that. You think I'm deaf? Well, it was an accident, honey. You said I don't have to repeat. When she talks, I can hear her. When I talk, she can't hear me, so you have to repeat. What was that? Well, it was an accident, honey. "Well, it was an accident, honey." Accident? What accident? You clearly acted smart. You jumped off a building without a harness. Why blame me? You think I want to die first? There are so many things I still want to do. I still want to marry you, shoot my first movie, go to the premiere. He said he didn't want this either. Why so short? Gosh, it's hard to memorize your long sentences. At least emote it a little. How could I get upset at Naya? So he's upset at me? Is that it? Tell him, why did he have to come back as a ghost if he just want to get upset? Tell him that if he enjoys being dead first, just leave. No need to bother... Where are you going? - Sit. - Okay, fine. If you don't want me here, I'll leave now! Okay, okay! I said, use emotion! "Okay, fine. If you don't want me here, I'll leave now!" Tell him to just leave. I'm going to bed. Naya! Are you serious, To? How scary. So, aren't you afraid? At first, I was afraid, but after a while, it gets annoying. Then, this is it. I won't come to your house anymore. Hey, don't say that. This is a chance for our career. How about we cultivate Vino? What do you mean "cultivate"? You think he's a catfish? We can ask him to move stuff, then we take videos. - We'll have content. - You're crazy, To. That's consorting with the devil. We won't be consorting. Collaborating. No way. Besides, Vino may not agree. Of course he will. - To, I'm leaving! - Just a minute. To, he's angry. He used all caps and two exclamation marks. Wait just a moment. Let's try and talk to him. To. To, he added another exclamation mark! - Bro. - Let's stop this, To. Bro, please. Instead of haunting aimlessly, you better help us make content. Become a YouTuber, bro. Vino. To, he wrote "No!". - Don't force him if he doesn't want to. - What's wrong? - Vino can't do anything to us. - Gosh, To. Darto! Bro, that one was good. - Can you please move the curtain too? - Don't! - You're crazy, To! - The books too. - The window. - Turn it off. What are you saying? - To, that's enough. - Bro, we're making content. To. Darto! Look, I'm dead! I'm dead! He'll slit my throat! No, it's alright. What do you mean, "it's alright"? He'll slit my throat, not yours! He'll slit my throat! These are Vino's belongings from the filming location. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry, Nay. I should've tried harder to stop Vino from jumping that night. Moreover, he seemed out of focus. Like he was troubled. It wasn't your fault, Dim. Uh, alright, Nay. I need to go back to the filming location. Yeah. - I'll go now. - Take care. Sorry, Bill. Vino was just kidding. Besides, I think he's gone. Why are you looking at me like that? I know what can make you relax. Just a second. A BOOK IS A WINDOW OF THE WORLD Bill, take a look. Here. Well? Are you feeling better? You are my best friend, To. Thanks. That's why you shouldn't be afraid. Vino is kind. These magazines are from him. Darto? Darto. Put them back. Put them back! Straighten it up. - Massage me. - Alright. To? Yes, that part. It hurts. - What are you two doing? - Massage. Hi, Bill. Let me borrow Darto for a while. You want me to be your medium for your fight with Vino? No way. He knows. Please, To. I promise we won't fight this time. No, sis. I feel like a referee. To, you know the only way for me to talk to Vino is through you. This is important. Well, find another way. What other way? I can see Vino when I touch you, someone precious to him, so, just find a precious thing that belonged to Vino and touch it. Simple, right? Yes, but what? MORAL AND CHARACTER EDUCATION FOR YOUTH There is something. But promise you won't be mad? Is it true? Vino gave you these magazines? Yes, sis. When he first tried to approach you, he bribed me with them. - Is that true, Bill? - I don't know anything, sis. I'm just a guest. I thought I dumped these magazines in the trash. - Why are they still here? - True. But they were taken out from the trash by Billy. Huh? But you were the one who wanted them back. Fine. I wanted them more. I can explain about those magazines. Have you... eaten? I haven't. Why haven't you eaten? - If you eat late, you'll... - Die? I did, Nay. - Sorry, I didn't mean to... - It's okay. It's unusual for you to wear a cap. It's from the wardrobe. So, why are you wearing it? I died during a scene take, wearing this costume, so I haunt wearing this cap. I feel sorry for a motorbike taxi driver when he dies. Why? He will haunt wearing a helmet. How come you never told me that your mom wanted to give me this necklace? Actually, when I was about to give it to you, we had a fight. I apologize, Nay. Please forgive me too, Vin. If you became a lingering spirit because of me, I will try to sincerely let you go. That's not the reason I'm still here, Nay. Then, what is it? Actually, I want to... help with... your anthology project. You need a ghost writer, right? Let me do it. I can make the table of contents. Choose your font? Okay, then. Deal. Oh, Vin. As a human or as a ghost, you still like to sweet talk. Vino. So, any idea what theme will you write about for your anthology project? Not really. But you know, right? I will be writing together with Ms. Widuri. You've said hello For a thousand times Yet it still feel like the first time You say it Each time we hi'd I've grown to love What are you looking for? I need Kirana Widuri's book, The Dancer's Curse, as a reference, but I think I misplaced it when we moved here. - Let me look for it. - Hey. You just continue your work. Let me look for it. Here it is. This one, right? Why is it still in plastic? - It's new. - Where did you get this? - The bookstore, of course. - Did you steal this? How could a ghost buy a book, Nay? Come on. Just borrow it for a while. You can't do that. This is criminal. Just because you're a ghost, don't behave like the devil. - You're supposed to... - Fine, I'll return it. Fine, I'll just borrow it for a while. Typical human. That I like you, I might even love you Nay, eat first. Maybe later. Besides, I haven't ordered anything. - How about I prepare you a meal? - Well, that's fine. I'll make you yummy smashed egg with soy sauce. - What's that? - Fried egg. - With soy sauce. - Oh. Alright. - What's wrong, Vin? - That. Garlic. Aren't ghosts supposed to be afraid of garlic? Well, are you afraid? I guess not. I watched too many movies. What do you think? Does it taste good? Good? But this could be such a mess - Coffee order for Ms. Naya? - That's right. - How much? - Fifty thousand. What's wrong with that guy? You had to lift the bag. You asked me to hold it. How can a ghost be afraid of another ghost? I'm not afraid. I was just surprised. For example, you, a human, get surprised by another human. Ghosts are like that too. Cartoon, Nay. Let's just watch a cartoon. Just relax, Nay. You just type and I'll edit. I won't edit your story. Like, fixing the typos. Here, let me check. "Last night, the memories blanded." It's suppose to be "blended". Like that. So, anyway... But this could be such a mess I know I want to hold you This is the one, Dul. Love to death. The guy's dead, but he still takes care of his girlfriend. Amazing. What do you mean "amazing"? Stupid guy. - Why stupid? - He's stupid. He's dead. Why does he still take care of her? It's love to death. He takes care of her even in death. It's not wrong, right? Wrong. It's called "love to death". When you're dead, it's done. Why extend the contract one-sidedly? Huh? Like, you take a train to Jogja. - Do you stop at Jogja? - I do. That's the same for loving someone to death. It stops when one is dead. So weird. Not like that. Here, for example, you go on a vacation to Jogja. When you reach Jogja, do you stop, or do you travel? - I stop. - You don't travel? I've been to Jogja many times. - To Malioboro? - Been there. - The Palace? - Been there. - Mount Merapi? - Twice. Then, why go on a vacation to Jogja? Who wants to go on a vacation to Jogja? You were the one who told me to. - I thought you wanted to. - Don't be a smarty-pants. Sorry. - Okay. - Hi, sir. I've reviewed your story with Ms. Broto. Frankly, we don't really like it. It feels too pretentious. Like... you're trying too hard to become like Ms. Widuri. You lost your style that we grew fond of all this time. Don't you wanna write another horror story? Perhaps what suits you best is writing horror stories instead of romance. I still have time, right? How about I make a new draft? Are you sure? Come on. Don't think about it. I'm sure you can write something even better. But what if I fail? Do I have to keep writing about ghosts? Well, it's fine. Just write about me. I'm not in the mood for a joke. You know I became an author not just for money. What if this matter ends up making me hate the thing I love most? Nay. Who were you talking to? I wasn't talking to anyone. I was... - I was singing. - Sounds like you were talking. No, I was singing a rap song. "What if I end up hating the thing that I love most? Uh-huh." Oh. I thought you have a new ghost friend. No, ma'am. Why would I talk to a ghost? So unimportant. Alright. Oh. Rap. Iwa Q. "How should I know..." I don't know the lyrics. Vin? - What is it? - It's nothing. Just continue writing. I can tame Vino, but he could go berserk anytime. Come on, To. Let's call this off. He was about to slit my throat. He was only about to. So, you want me to get it slit for real? That's why we're asking for Mr. Saidi's help. What do you say, sir? We need an apparition for our video to go viral. We need a ghost. If the ghost doesn't want it, don't force him. Find a ghost that is willing. Is there any ghost that wants to be commanded? Of course, To. There are many kinds of ghosts. Some ghosts like to giggle. Some ghosts like to stay silent. Some ghosts even stay thirsty. - Thirsty? - Yes. They died choking on pineapple cookies. So, can you find us a ghost? Is there anything I can't do, To? Just find the right time. The ritual is difficult. How much, sir? Gosh, for this much, I can only summon a deaf ghost. Want one? Bill. Give me a break, To. Hurry. Here. For this much, the ghost I'll summon won't be deaf but stupid. Add some more, Bill. Come on, To. A stupid ghost is fine. Of course not. Just add some more. Darn it! You keep money inside your underwear? Won't the national heroes wheeze? - Fine if you don't want it. - Of course I do. Hope they're not wheezing. Found you at last. Should've told me that you moved. Are you snails? Switching houses silently? Sorry, sir. Sorry? - Come, sir. - Hey. You two wait here. What are you going to do? I have to do the ritual. I have to get stark naked. - Why do you have to get naked? - That's how it is. To summon soft creatures, we have to use soft things. What do you mean "soft"? Your skin's all rough. Rough according to you. Ghosts think I'm so soft. I need to get in. Move. Okay. Sir, are you done? Gosh, be patient, will you? So excited. Take my underwear. To. The door opened by itself. Gosh. Sir? Has the ghost arrived? So quick. I just touched my underwear. To, I think it's Vino. Gosh, I'm toast. Vino, please don't tease us. We're not asking you to do things. We're looking for another ghost. Come on, To. Call this off. Mr. Saidi's not done yet. Just wait. Just a little longer. Sir! The fan moved! Well, good. It can cool the air. No, we mean, a ghost is here! Well, you two requested it. Just talk with the ghost. No, this ghost is scary! You're such a coward! Open up, sir! Who is here? This is not one of my partners. Sir, help! Where's my underwear? Help, sir! The ghost is here! Just a second! I lost my underwear. It fell! Dammit! Why did it have to fall? - Break the door down! - One, two, three! Goodness, please don't grab it. It's slipping! Fine, take it! Sis Naya! Why are you naked in front of my brother? They asked me to. Huh? Why did you ask this old man to get naked? Billy paid him, sis. Huh? So you paid this old man to get naked? What's taking her so long? Mine will shrink. - Here. - Please hold this. Come on. Thank you, miss. - Don't forget this. - Gosh, miss. It's not a fritter. That's it, sir. Stop lying to my brother. Goodness, miss. Who's lying? I really can summon ghosts. If you can summon ghosts, then why were you afraid? The problem is, the ghost that came wasn't the one that I summoned. Just so you know, in this house, there's a malicious ghost. That's it. I don't want to stay here. I want to go home. To, you should spend the night at Billy's house. I ordered a cab. Is it okay, Bill? It's alright, sis. Sis, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad. I'm not mad. As long as you're safe, alright? Look, the cab is here. Careful. Bye, Bill. Tell me the truth. There's another ghost in this house, right? I will explain everything. Where do you keep my stuff from Dimas? Touch the pin, Nay. I knew it. She's been following us for a while, Vin. Haven't you had that pin for a long time? Don't tell me you've never seen her before! I saw her once. How come you didn't tell me? How could I tell you, Nay? You hate it when people discuss ghosts. What if you died because of her? No, Nay. She's the one who died because of me. What do you think? Isn't it romantic? It's so romantic, honey. The bubbles break easily, but my love for you won't ever break. Siti used to live in Lampung. She and her daughter used to watch me on TV. I heard that Vino will film his next TV drama at the neighboring village. Is that true, Auntie? It's true. How about we give a present for Uncle Vino? We'll put Vino's name on this pin, alright? Their lives there were miserable. Tomorrow, we'll buy a new school bag for you, Murni, but don't tell your father... What's that? It's nothing, dear. What's that? - What's that? Give it to me! - It's nothing. - Please don't. - Father! It's for Murni's school bag! I hope you die! What did you say? Father! You, keep quiet! Mother. - Siti! - Come with us! - You insolent wife! - Shut up! - Move! - Siti! When I did a shoot in Lampung, Siti and her daughter came to see me at the location. For you, Uncle Vino. For me? Come. Sit here. Here you go. Come. Sit. Here. Have some. Take whatever you like. Mr. Vino, don't you have anyone to help you? Oh, you mean, like an assistant? Actually, I'm in the process of looking for one. If... someone wants to help you, what are the qualifications? I don't have any requirements. Anyone can do it, including you. I'm willing to do it, sir. I'm scared. What if Father suddenly comes home? I promise. When I have some money, I will pick you up before your father gets released. Murni, please wait here. Siti actually came looking for me and left her kid back in Lampung. Come sit, please. So, how about it, sir? Oh, about that, we had a little miscommunication. I've talked to my manager. My manager said I better find a male assistant to drive me around, carry stuff that's quite heavy. Vin, let's take the shot. - Just a second. - Okay. They're calling me. Let me take my scene quickly. I promise I'll come back and we'll find a solution. Okay? Bro. Celebrities like that can't be trusted. You should work with me. It's guaranteed. Come on. - Keep quiet! - Help! Just strike her if she won't shut up. Turned out that Siti was tricked by her acquaintance who took her to Jakarta. Hurry up! Topan. He's a syndicate member. Siti was kidnapped for her organs. - You fool! - Hey, don't run, you witch! Help! Shut up! Help! Take that! If I hadn't talk carelessly... Siti wouldn't have ended up like this, Nay. So, you're sure you're still haunting because of Siti? I'm sure, Nay. I'm sure this is the cause. That's why we must help Siti find her daughter. But why me? Who else, Nay? Who would help a ghost? So, if I help Siti... you will leave for good? Nay. If I could choose, I wouldn't want to go anywhere. I want to stay here with you, Nay, but the longer I'm here, it will only bring more trouble for you and Darto. So, you're going to Lampung to help Siti? Well, whether I like it or not. Why are you staring at me like that? No, bro. It's nothing. Your skin looks brighter. - Thank you. - But there's a problem. - What? - That's the thing. Siti said a ghost can't cross the ocean. Really, bro? You don't trust me? Wanna ask Siti directly? - I'll call her. - No, bro. I trust you. No wonder. Each country has its own ghosts. True. That's why we don't have Chinese vampires here. Yeah, and they don't have pocong or tuyul in China. Dragging nurse. There are nurse ghosts in China, but I think they all stand up. - Yes, because... - What's with you two? I know, right? You two should help. - Sorry. - Sorry. I think we should ask for help from an expert. To, do you think that old man could help us? - What old man? - The naked one. I can do it, but for this one, I want yesterday's fee doubled. Why do you need double? You don't have to get naked this time. I don't have to get naked, but I have to deliver ghosts. Inter-island even. The risk is high. Not to mention if they get sea sick. Fine. Tell you what. I'll pay half of it. I'll pay the rest when you have successfully proven yourself. Fine. Give me the money. But don't fail us or you'll have to pay us back. With interest. This kid is a loan shark. There, relax. Leave everything to Saidi, alright? You need to deliver something else? Then, get lost. You're disturbing my deadline. Go on. What are you doing, Nay? I still can't find a suitable car rental and we have to depart before dawn. Vin, I seriously only have one day. It's almost the deadline for the anthology project. Yes, that would be enough. Are you guys preparing? - Hi, Bill. - Hi, sis. Where have you been? I had to take my parents to the airport. They'll be in Surabaya for two weeks. So, they don't use your car? No, it's parked outside. Sis, let's use Billy's car. It's available. To, I need to go. Hey, just a minute. What's the hurry? Sit down. I'm scared, To. If my dad finds out that we took the car, he'll be furious. Siti could be furious too. Alright, alright! You may use my car. - Sis. - Yes? Drive slowly, please. Use the left sign lamp to go left and the right lamp to go right. Yes, Bill. And you should pump the brake a bit. It's not working properly. Okay. - One more thing, sis. - What, Bill? My hat, sis. Oh. - Here. - Thank you, sis. Let's go. The house key, sis. I think one of you have to move to the backseat. You or Vino. Oh, Vino is here? Fine, you move to the back. No, To, you move here. - Why? - How could you let me sit next to a ghost? - Hurry up. - Fine. Just a second. Where are you going? Go this way. - Calm down. - Hurry. Calm down! You're such a coward. Where are Billy and Darto meeting Mr. Saidi at? They said at the front gate. Is it true that ghosts can't cross the ocean? Or perhaps it's just Siti who can't? Ghosts have different skills. Try it. Vin. I think we better wait for Darto and Billy. What are you doing, sis? No, nothing. Have you met Mr. Saidi? We did. Where is it? - Why put it there? - I was afraid of the inspection. What if it got confiscated? What's that? This is the amulet, sis. Mr. Saidi said that as long as this amulet is on the ship, the ghost energy will last on the ocean. Consider it a power bank for ghosts. Alright, let's go. When we reach Lampung, keep your camera on standby, so, when Vino or Siti move stuff, you record it. Not bad for video content. Will it be dangerous? It's safe. Nay. Thank you for helping. - Yo! - Guys, what's up? We're on our way to Lampung. What are we doing? Looking for a ghost's kid! Want to know more about our adventure? - Don't forget to like... - Comment... - And subscribe. - Yeah. See you on the next video. Only on... My Ghost, My Adventure. Come, To. To. How can we leave my car here? What's wrong? What if it gets stolen? It's so quiet, nobody's here. If nobody's here, who will steal it? Naya, wait. To, wait for me. To. Is this the house, sis? I think so. Record it. - No. - Record it! We might get a ghost shot. Wow, this is insane. TIPS TO HAVE FUN ON A FILM SET Murni is not here. Her belongings are gone. - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm Siti's friend from Jakarta. May ask you something? Of course. Please. I was at Siti's house, but why is it empty? Oh, actually, the house was sold last month, but the buyer hasn't cleaned things up. Is that so? If I may ask, why isn't Siti with you? She's fine, right? She is. It's just that she's busy. Oh, because there has been bad rumors about Siti in this village. Really? Like what? They said she now works in Jakarta as a prostitute. That's why she's ashamed to return and ended up abandoning Murni, like that. What's wrong, miss? No, it's nothing. So, where are Mr. Djarot and Murni now? Maybe you can check the neighboring village or the rubber tree farm. - Djarot usually works part time there. - Okay. - What is it, miss? - Nothing. Perhaps you'd like a drink? - No... - We do, and some snacks. Excuse me. May I ask if you know this man? How about the girl? Afternoon. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? To, you ask them. You'll deliver tomorrow, right? I'm out of town, sir. Why are you out of town? Yes, sorry. An emergency came up, but I will finish it, sir. Can I ask for more time? Just one day. I've told you from the start. Are you sure you want to join this project? The time is short. You said you could, and I trusted you. If it's like this, how am I supposed to answer to Ms. Broto? Please, sir. I promise I will deliver it in two days. Two days, before 12,00 p.m. I'll wait for the script. If you can't deliver, we'll cancel this. Thank you, bro. Nobody knows them, sis. Let's try the rubber tree farm. Naya? Sis? Why go straight? Aren't we suppose to turn at the intersection? Turn back. Enough. We're going back to Jakarta. We've been circling without any results. I said I only have one day and that's it. I said turn back! - Naya! - Siti! Siti, don't do this! Sis, what's happening? - Stop it, Siti! - What's she doing? Siti, stop this! - Gosh. - Oh, dear. What happened, sis? Nay, are you alright? - Do you want me dead? - Of course not, Nay. If you want me dead, that's fine, but leave Darto and Billy out of this! Not like that, Nay. We're... Tell Siti that I'm done! I don't care what she wants. I'm going home. - Nay. - Come. Naya. - Siti! - Ghost! Quick, throw the pin away! Alright! There! Hurry, sis! Now, what? Siti, what are you doing? Sis, what should we do? Siti, stop this. - Sis! - Siti, they could get hurt. Please. Siti, it's dangerous! Siti. Siti, they've done nothing wrong. Pull it! Siti, stop it! Sis. Naya, get out of here, quick! Sis, let's go! Gosh, I'll get kicked out of the house if my dad sees his car got wrecked. Relax. Naya will take it to the workshop. Should I confess now? So, when my dad returns, his anger will only be half left. Call him. To. The whole incident got recorded. - Which one? - The one we just had. Look. Wow, this is insane. This is expensive content. What should we do with this? Of course, we upload it. Are you sure? What if Sis Naya finds out? Just go for it. I'm sure we'll get one million viewers. - A million? - Yeah. - Seriously? - Yes. A million what? Billy's car repair cost. It won't reach a million, sis. He has insurance. I do? Don't you? You think Siti will follow us again? I don't think she will. She said she can't cross the ocean. Besides, we have the amulet, so, Vino can't follow either. What else should we do, To? We should've gone to the rubber tree farm like Ms. Ida said. Do you even realize, To? We almost died back there. I do realize it very much, but Vino was the one who saved us. And now, we just leave him? Sis, I think that's our ship. We get on board now? Where's Billy and Darto? I told them to go home. I don't want to put them in danger anymore. Let's continue to find your daughter. Sir. - Who are you? - I'm Naya, Siti's friend. Siti. Siti. Damn witch! Where's Murni, sir? Murni was taken to Jakarta. That kid kept on crying, looking for her mother! Who took her to Jakarta, sir? Of course, it's Topan! RUBBER FOREST - CITY SETASARI VILLAGE So, Siti's daughter is with the syndicate? Yes. Now, we're really racing against time to find the girl. Before anything happens to her. Fine. Let's just go to the place where Siti was held. The problem is, Siti doesn't even know where that warehouse is. Siti was taken there unconscious. Don't you wanna call the police? They'll think I'm crazy. You wanna tell them that our informants are ghosts? I think I can help find that place. I see you're quite serious managing this channel. Of course I'm serious, sis. Although I had to force Billy. He gets scared easily. Huh? As if you don't. To, help me out. It's heavy. See, someone's helping you. Carry on. But are you okay if people comment that you're a fraud or looking for attention? Well, as long as I'm not a fraud, I don't care, sis. I bet it stills bother you when they call you a shaman. Just let them be, sis. You know how those netizens are. Don't listen to them. Besides, it's an advantage for you to be able to see ghosts. Because it makes my book sell? Because it gives you more time with Vino before you have to really let him go. - Are the cables set? - I plugged them all. Nay, are you sure you wanna do this? People will really see you as a paranormal expert. MISTER ALVIN It's almost 12,00 p.m. You'll email me soon, right? Sir, please don't be mad, but I'll have to forfeit the anthology project. Alright. But you know what the consequences are, right? Yes, sir. I will write three more books about ghosts as per my contract. Okay. Again, I'm sorry for always troubling you. Hello, guys! Welcome back to Dolly's channel. - Darto and... - Billy. Only at My Ghost, My Adventure. Okay guys, finally, we can collaborate with my sister, the author of Ghost Writer, who you've all been waiting for. Sis Naya! Hello. So, those apparition videos that we uploaded before were actually Sis Naya's journey to help a female ghost who's looking for her daughter in Lampung. That's right, guys. And coincidentally, right now, we have the ghost herself in person. Um, ma'am? Can you please introduce yourself? Is that real? - It gives me goosebumps. - That's fake. - It's a setup. - It's real. It can't be a setup. It's live. They can't edit this. Siti came to Jakarta to find work, but she became a victim of human trafficking. She was held captive for organ harvesting. When she tried to escape, she was murdered, and her body was dumped at the side of a tollway. After our investigation in Lampung a few days before, we found out that Murni, Siti's daughter, was taken to Jakarta by the same people who kidnapped Siti. Naya is insane. What's with Naya, sir? She's helping a ghost to find her daughter. Huh? Where did she lose her? I don't know, but still around Greater Jakarta area, right? - Perhaps. - What was she last seen wearing? Well, the usual kid's outfit. Enough. You're noisy. Oh, perhaps that's the cause. Her outfit was too ordinary, so she's hard to find. When you go missing, you should wear something that stands out, right? Like a traditional costume? That's right. Maybe traditional Minang costume. People will notice the huge headdress. Not traditional Minang costume. Eastern traditional costume is better. Minang costume stands out more. It's shaped like a horn. Golden, huge. People will notice. Eastern costume stands out more. With feathers, leaves, tassels, cassowary. It can be seen from far away. No, Minang costume stands out more. - Eastern. - Minang. Sir, which region's costume stands out more? Conflict region! So noisy. Ah, see? So, it's the Eastern region. Conflict region. The perpetrator is called Topan. - His characteristics... - What's with the commotion? - He's a 30-year-old male. - Naya's looking for a ghost's kid. He has curly hair and a scar on his right cheek. My father used to call me that. They disguise themselves as a labor agency. So, friends, if you have any info about this person, please let us know immediately. What did I tell you? - What, ma'am? - See, Naya's passion. The paranormal world. You have to see this. - What? - Look. I'm sure many of you will not believe my reason, but this is a matter of responsibility. So, at first, Siti came to Jakarta to apply as Vino's personal assistant. How can she use her late fianc√© to look for sensation on social media? And Vino is here with us as well. Vino, can you please say hi to our viewers? SITI HELLO - Let's just go home. - Huh? Go home? So, that's the story. And let us assure you that this live streaming is 100% real. So, we're really asking for your help. If you have any info about Murni, Siti's girl, or Topan, please contact us by leaving comments down here. To, we've been looking with no results. Do you think we can find Siti's daughter? Of course we can. Don't give up. We'll find her. - Let's look further. - Okay. - Check the new comments too. - Yeah. "Bro, your video is so scary." "I hope you'll find the girl soon." What is it, ma'am? Can I ask for one more favor? Sis Naya. Sis, I think someone recognized Topan. - Where? - Here. "Bro, is this for real?" "The criminal's features match one of my mom's diner's regular customers." "Near the pier, Kampung Rawa." Look at the replies. "That's right. I think he stays in an empty warehouse near the pier with a huge windmill." Windmill. Okay. Alright. Vin. You take the front door. I'll find a side entrance. And... Ugh, why does she like to vanish like that? So annoying. Calm down, Nay. That's how ghosts are. Zero to zero. I have one right here. Sir, I need the police's assistance. Come on. Stop crying. You'll get hungry if you cry too much. Those brats are noisy! Pri, tell them to keep quiet. What are they doing? Come. Let's play again. Who's there? Come out, you bastard! What's happening? Perhaps it's a ghost, bro. What ghost? Murni. Come on, you all. Get out. Come out! Murni, take the girls out through there. Miss, please help us. Open the cage. Be careful. I don't care if you're a ghost, I'm not afraid! Come out if you dare! Fight it. Don't just stand here. How are we suppose to fight it, bro? You two, get out. Find out who's behind this. - It won't open, bro. - Just break it down. Hey, what are you doing? Vin, Vino! Help, Vin! Calm down, Nay. I'll handle this. Hey, don't do anything funny. - Sorry, Nay. I could do it in Lampung. - Get them! Come on. Come. Step forward. Siti, that's enough. Stop it, Siti. If he dies, I'll be suspected as the murderer. Hi. I made that with Mother. A gift for Uncle Vino. He's funny. Your mother asked me to tell you that she's sorry because she can't return home, and she asked me to give you this. Murni. Forgive me, child. I shouldn't have left you. You have to survive, child. Survive. I love you, Murni. I love you so much, more than anything. Mother. Mother. Goodbye. So, you too will leave soon? Vin. If you see my mom and dad, please tell them that Darto and I are doing fine here. I have to go, Nay. You take care of yourself, okay? Promise me. Why aren't you disappearing? I don't understand either. Maybe they forgot to pick me up. Or perhaps I still have unfinished business? Huh? We went all the way to Lampung. Turns out that you're still haunting not because of Siti? Well, I don't know, Nay. This is my first time being a ghost. I still don't know things. Why are you mad at me? You, as a human or as a ghost, - always act smart. - There you go. As a human or as a ghost, you always blame me. Alright. Now, what? I don't know. Excuse me, Doc. This... It's alright. No more patients, right? No, Doc. Excuse me. Oh, Vino. What's with you? As if I never taught you any manners. You changed our wedding venue without asking me or Naya. - Is that what you call manners? - What? I've been telling you for two months to find a venue with a large capacity. - I know. - And you responded so late! Suddenly, Naya sent me a WhatsApp text. She asked me to make an invitation list for only 75 guests. What did you expect? I immediately called the wedding organizer. I know, Mom, but you should've calmed down a bit. No matter what, this is my wedding with Naya. How much longer will you let her steer you? Since you met her, you've become a totally different person, Vino. You dropped out of medical school - to join a movie production! - Mom. All because of her, right? It's all because of me, Mom. Those were my decisions. I wanted them, not Naya. I'm sorry that all this time, my happiness was regrettable to you. Sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have been born as your son. Vino! What are you here for? Vino is gone. I came tonight... to say something to you, ma'am. I shouldn't have... given you that necklace. Ma'am. I understand that you still feel great loss. Understand? You understand? You understand? The feelings of a mother who lost her only child? Do you? Vino. Vino was my whole life. In fact, I never allowed anyone to hurt his heart. And you... You... You turned me into the only person who hurt him the most. Do you know what he said before he left me? He regretted... He regretted... to have been born as my son. Now, you tell me which part you understand. Which part? Huh? Ma'am. I don't know what else to do to make you stop hating me, but I need you to know that I sincerely love Vino. I always wanted the best for Vino. And that's why I came tonight. I want to fulfill Vino's last wish. What do you mean? This necklace. This necklace means a lot to Vino. I need you to touch this necklace so you can talk to... Stop it, Naya. Stop talking nonsense. Stop! Ma'am, I beg you. - Just this once, please trust me. - No, I don't want to listen! Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am, just this once. Mom. Ma'am. Mom. You don't need this necklace. You two are equally the most precious people in my life. This proves it. Mom. Forgive me for leaving you like this. And please forgive me for saying something that hurt you. Forgive me too, son. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have come between you two. Nay, Mom. No matter how much time passes by, I can never choose one of you. So, please. Please stop blaming each other because that's the only thing that can give me peace. Please, Mom, Nay. You can return now, son. I'll take care of Naya here for you. Excuse me. Oh, come in, Nay. This is Naya, Ms. Wid. Our author who likes to be haunted by ghosts and deadlines. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi. I'd like to submit my synopsis for a new horror novel. It's about Siti. It's about Siti, the human trafficking victim? Yes, Ms. Wid. The one who uncovered the case was Naya. May I read it? - Sure. - Thank you. Is it possible for us to write together? What do you mean? Actually, at the moment, I'm writing about violence against women. Perhaps we can start a cross-generational collaboration? But... I write with a pop style. So what? I'm afraid I'll lower your image, ma'am, considering that your writing is far more substantial. But I'd say... substantial work is something that can move feelings, the minds of the readers. So, what's important is how we communicate our work. No matter how good the aesthetic is, if we can't communicate it, it's useless, right? Literature is a form of art, and art in its essence is not to compete. All are equally noble. All are equally honorable. Especially if it sells in the market. We'll surely have honorable pockets, right? Congratulations, sir. Such a cute baby. Have you decided on a name? I have, Doc. I'll name him Vino. Stay healthy and happy, child. Today is supposed to be Vino's birthday. Not that baby Vino. Our Vino. So, we plan to celebrate it. Come with us. I think this should be your special time. I'll go on ahead. - Take care, ma'am. - Yes, okay. Sis Naya. Are you done in the bathroom? Mom, this is Murni. Murni? Yuyun? - Dadang? - What are you doing here? I honestly have feelings for you. A little. But my mother prefers that I'm with Marco. His name is Marco? Cool name. That's your mother's reason. What's your reason to choose him over me? Marco is a kind person. I'm also kind, Yun. I got a nine for Nationalism. Marco is smart. I'm smart too. I have two report cards. Marco owns a motorbike. Fine then, Yun. If you prefer him, maybe this is best for us. I hope you two stay happy. I'm sincere. At least I was once a small part of your happiness. And that's enough. I have to go now. MY LOVE CRASHED BY TRANSPORTATION If you have more ghosts' stories, we'll adapt them into books right away. - We'll find the writer. What do you say? - What about the royalties? We have our total income. We have the production fees, distribution fees, donations. You'll get 10%. From the net profit, we'll get 60%, and you'll get 40%. What? Why is your share bigger? Fifty-fifty. Subtitle translation by: Febianto Rahardjo
