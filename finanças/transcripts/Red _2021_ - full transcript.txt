Checking out the girl in the yellow dress? Her name is Mahima. She is the Creative Head at Dream Ads. We work in the same apartment building. Her office is on the tenth floor. I see her in the elevator every morning. Our working hours are different. If I miss that chance, I don't get to see her again on that day. We either decide whether a girl is right for us or not and spend some time with her… or we spend some time with a girl and then take a decision. However, neither holds true in this girl's case. The moment I saw her, I realized… that she is the one! I used to be alone with her in the elevator… for about ten seconds after everyone got off. Initially, she didn't bother to talk to me, but after a few days… she started noticing me. So, I finally broke the silence and asked her… Can I take you out for a cup of coffee? You've never introduced yourself and we've never talked… -yet, you're asking me out for a coffee! -True… but this coffee date is to introduce ourselves and talk for ten minutes. You didn't answer my question. That's because your question is wrong. I'll come only if you ask the right question. What did she even mean? She could've simply said, "yes" or "no" for the date. This is just strange. I'll tell you later. Okay, bye. Can I take you out for a cup of coffee? Sorry, my bad! I think, you are a feminist. So, will you take me out for a cup of coffee? Shall we go out for a cup of coffee? You are avoiding me on purpose, right? You can say no if you don't want to come. I swear… still, your question is wrong. If you ask me the right question, I'll definitely agree. Bye! Can I take you out? Will you take me out for a cup… Shall we go out for a cup of… I swear, I've never had to think so much even for a project. It's okay if you don't want to come with me, but please tell me what the right question is. Tea! The right question is, "Can I take you out for a cup of tea?" Because I hate coffee! -Three days. -Actually, -my sense of humor-- -No, it's okay. Never mind. It's my mistake. Tea! Why not! Shall we go… for a cup of tea? Yeah. Tea. Tea? Cute, right? You think it's cute because a girl said that. Had I said the same thing, you would've embarrassed me in front of all our friends. Of course! Girls can be a little innocent. -I am Sid-- -Siddharth. Civil engineer. You are into construction. You don't smoke or drink. You like bikes and cars. How do you know all this? You got the information about the person you like. So, I just did the same thing. Hi. Sorry, I got late. It's okay. I used to get to see her… just for a few seconds, and now… even if I get late, she waits for me. See how far I've come. Then, why wait? Just propose to her. She found out everything about me on her own. So, now, I'll wait 'til she gets to know me completely. She'll leave no stone unturned if she realizes that I am the one for her. She'll propose to me. A strange incident has taken place in Bhuvaneshwar at around 3:00 a.m. this morning. We all must have heard of money being stolen from the ATM, but in this case, a gang of seven people has stolen the entire ATM. The bank has informed us that… the ATM was loaded with cash more than 20 lakhs just an hour before the incident took place. The police are looking for the culprits. Why are you showing this to me? To know if you like the news anchor. Don't ask me these silly questions! Do you know who stole that ATM with 25 lakh rupees? My partner. It's 25 lakhs, boss. That's a lot of cash. -What's that? -It's nothing. We thought we could steal the money on the spot, so we hit it hard with a rod, but we could not open it. Only a person who knows the mechanism of an ATM can open it. -Boss, yours is big. -What? I mean, your circle is big. That's why, we got it here. It is not possible at this time. You won't get any mechanic until Monday afternoon. But it is not safe to keep it here until then. I have a warehouse. We will keep it there. For safety. -What about them? -Who? Five more people are involved in this work. If any of them gets caught, we'll be at risk. We have to get rid of them immediately by giving them a lakh each. Just give us five lakhs, boss. We will take care of the rest. Five lakhs? Let it be. Let's go. -Partner, wait. -How is it fair? We're supposed to trust him with 25 lakhs, -but he can't trust us with five lakhs! -Don't be mad, brother. I will give it to you. Shankar! Here are five lakhs. Boss, you have to open the machine in front of us. Sure, brother. Twenty for five! The money is in the upper chest, and they were hitting the lower chest. Fools! -Hello. -Did the mechanic come? Not yet, brother. I'll call you once he's here. I hope you remember. You have to open it in front of us. Sure, I will get it opened in front of you. Okay? "You have to open it in front of us." Mechanic, keep two sets of 2,000-rupee and 500-rupee notes separately. Put your brains in the museum. -What is it? -Twenty-five lakhs, my foot! There's nothing else inside. You guys are the fools, not them. This is not an ATM. This is a dummy. -Son. -Dad. Listen! Did you order any snacks? No, partner. Then, what are they coming here for? Momos! How can you fool us by showing us a dummy machine! If you don't give us back the money, we will complain to the police! Let's go to the police, Dad! Let's go! -Let's go, Dad! -Yes! Go, Dad. Go, Dad! If you go to the police, you will get caught along with us. Silly fellow! Traitors! If we are the traitors… who are you? How did you find out that there is no money in the ATM… if you didn't open the machine? Come on, tell us! Dad! Idiot! Who is good and who is bad in this world? Tell me. We all were born in the same way. So, everyone's the same. -At least, give us half the amount. -We don't even have 50 paise. We spent all your money. -Did you guys really spend all the money? -Yes! But how? Pretty girl! Where are you from? You seem to be lonely Why don't you come with me to Bheemili? With galore of dreams I stepped out of my home Men have cheated on me So, I left my family Dear, share your pain with me And see it go away There is one man Who can help you fix your life Really? Where is that man? Ask your hero to show up in front of me. In a passenger train with 12 coaches He said we shall go to Bombay At eleven o'clock I had to come secretly to the station As I was worried, people will see me At 1:30, the train would arrive On platform nine He showed me the window seat Of an AC compartment He slowly comforted me with a warm blanket There is nothing in store As the night falls Except the sirens of the train He heated up the ambiance And left me to my fate Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don't jump around hither tither! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Just come with me to the beach! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If I ruin your place… I will get to know everything With the pull of a string As I pulled the chain Someone called for me Cut to this scene And I am in Chennai The story is interesting What happened next? Did your Kanchipuram silk sari Fold at the borders yet? He said that he will take me To watch an English movie And that he will teach me the French kiss I am very happy! Oh, dear! The night is full of ecstatic energy Then, he drank a frothing beer While dancing in his lungi And slumbered into deep sleep After having sambar and idli Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don't jump around hither tither! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Just come with me to the beach! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If I ruin your place… I will get to know everything With the pull of a string Walking around through small gullies I went weak in the knees At the Charminar He gulped down some drinks So, you finally landed in Vizag! This city is beautiful Would you like to see around? Boss' cutout is like that of a lighthouse Let's go out and check out the city! Baby, your body is soft If you get down on the ground You will pass out Up and down This train runs all around If you like me and signal me I will stay here with you Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don't jump around hither tither! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Just come with me to the beach! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If I ruin your place… I will get to know everything With the pull of a string That's it! I am smoking a cigarette right now! He made me go around temples since morning. Why did you throw away half the cigarette? -Smoking is injurious to health. -So? So, if I'm smoking just the half, its side effect will also reduce that much. Crazy! Five minutes, baby. Baby? Why would you call him that? He is a retired bank manager. He has a lot of money. He has no wife. It seems like he's always wanted a woman like me. I've planned a trip to Shimla. I will get all the details of his credit card and debit card. I am fine with whatever we get. What do you think? Why? I am okay with your deal. What? Throw it away. -Let's snap a selfie. -Of course! Oh, you figured it out. Auntie Pavithra! You know the meaning of your name is "sinless," right? Did someone else name you or you chose it for yourself? -Shut your mouth! -All right. I can't hold it any longer, partner! Partner, it's Rubi. Did she see us? Even if she saw us, she won't enter the men's room. -Oh, no! She's here. -Aditya! Hey… what are you up to? He is urinating. I've been trying to reach you for a week. Why are you ignoring my calls? You don't even reply to my messages. You don't respond to my WhatsApp messages despite being online. I should have worn diapers. You don't even bother to message me on Google Pay! Messaging on Google Pay? What is this, bro? Nowadays, Google Pay is also being used for messages! I won't leave unless you tell me the reason for avoiding me! I can't relax myself 'til you're here, Rubi! I am not leaving without knowing the reason! Why did you give me false hopes? Did I ever say that I love you? No. Did I ever ask you to get married to me? Did I ever decide the names of our kids? Then, where did you get all these hopes from? What about our relationship? Time to switch to Paytm! Girls fall for you in a flash, but you leave them immediately. I don't get it, partner. So? Are you planning to make a biopic on me? Siddhu. I wanted to ask my dad when I was a kid… "Will you stay with us… until the end and can I trust you?" …but I never asked him as he was my dad. He left me and my mom. "Anyway, he's gone. At least, will you stay with me until the end? Can I trust you?" I thought I should ask this to my mother… but I did not ask her either. She left me and got married to someone else. And after that, nobody has crossed my path to date… to whom I could ask this question. Now, you've come into my life. Will you stay with me until the end? Can I trust you? Those, who have parents, think that… their wives are supposed to care of them. Then, there are people like me, who don't have parents. They take care of their wives as their parents. If there's anyone I want to spend my life with, it is only you. Did I get overly emotional? When it comes to us, anything less is a problem. Anything in excess is just fine. I love you. There are total 160 apartments. Sixty out of them are 3BHK apartments, and the rest are 2BHK apartments. So, you've started looting people already. There's sufficient corridor space and ample ventilation. Hey, be careful. Here, we have all the facilities we'd look for in our apartment. We provide all those amenities with less margin, and I have quoted the best price. As you said earlier, a lot of people around me are ready to loot. People usually can't bear someone else's success. So, they have their dirty trails. My father's savings and my savings… have been invested in this project. This project is going to decide my future. -If this fails-- -Hey! I am not the only one who understands your genuineness. Even your work that you do with so much passion… understands your genuineness. Here. If you put your heart into something, it never fails. I thought I'd fall in love with a creative person… like a painter, a writer or a musician. But what can I do… I got an engineer. Why? What's wrong with me? What is creative about you? You just draw the same thing differently each time. Am I not right? You took this picture near Howrah Bridge, right? Yes… so what? Strapless. -You wear it very easily… -Siddhu, give it to me! -but there is an engineer behind this. -Give it to me! -Cantilever Principle. -Siddhu, give it to me! The same principle used for the Howrah Bridge -has been used for this strapless bra. -Give it to me, Siddhu! Without any support, it can hold the fort. -Give it back, Siddharth! -Is it not creativity? There is an engineer even behind a woman's undergarment! That is my friend's. Really? But it's the same principle. -Okay! -Stupid. What's with you? I am going… to jail. Vema Imports and Exports. That shop is mine. Look at that, partner. It got sealed. It got sealed because I sold 30 duplicate computers… as the imported and the original ones. So, now, I am going to be exported to jail. Do I deserve going to jail? Bloody burgers! When did this happen? We were not partners back then. This case has been going on for the last three years. Tomorrow is the final verdict. There are ten more people involved in this case… but all of them have a lot of money and the support of influential higher-ups! So, they escaped this situation! I am the only one who's stuck! Do you have the charge sheet? I did not get a charger, partner. Why? Is your battery dying? -Hey! -What? I'm talking about a paper that has the details of the case filed against you. -Oh, okay. -Where is it? No matter how long you look at that paper, there is no use. It is not easy to fool them like we fooled the other people, partner. We're dealing with the law and the court here. The Tamil lawyer has finalized the matter. I am going to jail, for sure. I understood now how it must have happened. When Jayasudha said, "I will hit you" to Prakash Raj in the climax of the movie Bommarillu, everyone in the theater watched it very seriously… but I just… giggled, partner. I think, Miss Jayasudha cursed me… last night, in the Vema's house. Partner, please take me along with you when you'll go back. I am going to jail. Greetings, sir. Better late than never. Anyway, let's go. Did you study the case properly? No, I did not. If you've studied the case, -you may come in and talk. -Let it be, partner. Sir, my friend has no sense of how to talk. Yeah, I can see that. Come. Ask them to discharge you, they'll do it. It's not a hospital, it's the court. I can't ask them to discharge me. He is a public prosecutor. I see. He is using some legal words. You want me to discharge him! There were total 30 computers, and all of them were duplicate. The boxes had Dell's logo on them, but the computers inside were just hollow. He was caught red-handed by the police. Discharge him, my foot! Check the charge sheet. Hey, who are you? Everything's clearly mentioned in it about those 30 computers! Hey, stop! What is it? It is written here that 30 boxes were recovered, but they forgot to mention about the computers. Clerical mistake! I am sure… this is more than enough to go and talk inside. Now, leave. Let's move. Excuse me, sir! It's a very small issue, and we don't have to be geniuses to figure it out. We just have to use our brains a little. Got it? You can go now. Due to the lack of proper evidence, this case has been dismissed. On this happy occasion of my case dismissal, let's get drunk today, partner. By the way, what have you studied? -Inter. -Winter? How is it connected to what you spoke to my lawyer about? And… sorry, just a minute. Hello! I was about to call you, boss, but you called me before that. I am sure you remember. I can forget my birthday, but I can never forget the date I give you. I will give you the money tomorrow. Okay, boss. Bye. I will go and get some drinks for us, partner. What's with all the fuss about these brands! Oh, no! Such a big queue! Hey, Vema! What are you doing here? I should ask you this question. Didn't you go to jail? You're asking me as if it's a vacation spot. Why don't you tell me? Come. -Hey, go back. -I am with her. Adi pointed out some flaw in the charge sheet. Even the lawyer didn't know about it. And he says he's only studied until winter. He can speak four to five languages easily. I don't understand him at all. I know him better than you do. With that kind of intelligence, he can easily sell half the city. What can we do? But yes, just like everyone, he also has one weakness… gambling. He cannot control himself if he sees money. When he is gambling with the cards, he loses track of the time. Hey! Yesterday, when I called him, he said that the money is ready. Now, he says that he has no money. What happened to the money, Vema? He is telling you the truth. I took his money without his knowledge. And? I used it for gambling… and I lost it. Eight lakhs? You're saying you lost it all in one night! You may not have the fear of losing that money, but… I am sure Vema has that fear. He fears that he will be killed if he does not repay the money. Am I right, Vema? Yes, boss. I'm giving you one week. You owe me a total of eight plus one, nine lakhs. I not only eat fish that I get from the sea… but also kill people and throw them in the sea if they do something wrong. I would have been safe if I were in jail. Now, you've left me to die at his hands! That idiot says that he'll kill me and throw me in the sea. What kind of a person are you! Are you going to die if you don't gamble? Don't worry, it is just money. We will give it back. Call the machine maker, and ask him to make an ATM. How would we earn nine lakhs in one week, and how many ATMs-- Hey! Do you have any other option? Hello… Auntie? Did he start the work? He said he'll start the work only if we give him a lakh rupees. But we'd agreed to give him the money after the work is done. -Didn't you tell him? -I did, but he is not ready to listen. What the hell! -He earned so much money because of us-- -Calm down. Getting angry won't help. Trust me. We cannot get anything done without a lakh rupees. Aditya? I didn't expect to see you here like this, at all. Mother-in-law had told me that you'd be coming tomorrow. -Mother-in-law? -Sorry. I call your mother that. You said your mother's no more. It was scary to read in the newspapers about the heavy rains in Kolkata from the past three days. As it is, you are a pilot. I pray every day in the temple for your safety. I am learning Bengali, as well. I don't want it to become a problem after our marriage. -You're mistaking me for someone else-- -Oh, I forgot to tell you. Mother-in-law had asked me to give her some money for her treatment. She had asked for one and a half lakh rupees… but I only have a lakh in my account. So, I had come to the bank to withdraw the money. Mother-in-law's calling. Hello? Mother-in-law! This is a great opportunity Please, take the money. At the corner? I am coming. She is waiting in an auto-rickshaw. Go ahead, I'm coming. Okay. What about the money? It's just been ten minutes. I saw him outside the bank. I didn't expect to see him at all. I'm sure your mother-in-law didn't expect this as well. Auntie is surprised to see us. Don't you think so? Here's the money that you had asked for. It's okay. I am here, I will take care of my mother. -You may leave. -Okay. I'll get going, Mother. -Bye. -Bye. How can you act like a mother? I tried to flirt with you so many times. -Hey! -What-- Who's that girl? I told you not to drag me into your nonsense! I did not plan it. It just happened. We were just sharing an auto-rickshaw together. She said that she works at a cell phone store… her father works as a security guard and her family wants her to get married. I said that I am doing the same thing. And I showed her your picture. I told her that my son is a pilot. And that he lives in Kolkata. I just lied and she believed it all. What can I do? Did you have to use my photo? Had I showed his picture, she'd have jumped out of the auto-rickshaw. -Hey, what's wrong with me? -Hello? My father had called me. I told him that I met you and your mother. Did you give her my number? You change your number every two months, so… didn't you change your number? Hello? What's the update on Mother-in-law's treatment? Yes, her treatment has begun. She'll be perfectly fine. When can my father and I come to see her? I will tell you. Actually, I liked you the moment I saw your photo. I never expected to get such a good alliance for my marriage. My family is very happy about this. I… hello? Hello! The call got disconnected. I will not spare you… if she gets in my way ever again! One lakh rupees… gone. Come. We have a week before I get killed by Baabji. Please get a policy done on my name before that, partner. Then, you can happily play cards with the money you'll get from the policy after my death. -Don't overreact. -Who is overacting here? Had we taken one lakh rupees from her, we would've managed somehow! Why didn't you take that money? Hey, she works at a mobile shop. She must be thinking twice even before buying anything she likes, because of how less she earns. Poor girl. Leave it. Poor girl? What about me? Don't you care about my life, partner? Sorry… pilot. Kolkata, heavy rains. Drive carefully, okay? We will do something. Stop nagging me. Enough now! That Baabji is going to kill me anyway. I'd rather kill myself. Don't you feel like stopping me? I know you will not jump. Oh! You know everything! I am the only one who knows nothing. Hey! -No! -Hey, Vema! Hey, give me the bike keys. Pilots don't ride bikes. I'll be back after five days. Yeah, you told me about the trip with your friends. There are five of us. Three girls… and two boys. What? One of the boys is smart and handsome. Many girls have a crush on him… but he likes me. He is all prepared… to propose to me on this trip. This is what my friend told me. Oh, really? What should I say to him if he proposed to me? Tell him, "My boyfriend kissed me, and my lips are still wet." You and only you Are enough for me to live Then, you have no other wish That needs to be fulfilled You are like the rain That deserts crave You are like the gift That shows itself Yeah! Your touch has spoken about the void And I am full only with you I swear I didn't know How I lived all through If not for you I wouldn't realize my true self The love that makes us feel like We are the first couple of this world Isn't it crazy? Without madness Wouldn't love cease to exist? Is it wrong to spread the love? Isn't love the only truth? You and only you Are enough for me to live Then, you have no other wish That needs to be fulfilled You are like the rain That deserts crave You are like the gift That shows itself I just need one reason to live And that reason is you Don't say this to anyone For, this is our secret to keep Make your nest in my heart For the words that seek their way Aren't you the answer To whom should I submit myself to? Aren't you an answer to all my questions? For the first time in my life, I've done something good. What did you do? I've resigned from my job. -What? -Yes, I've resigned from my job. Why? That is what I also thought, "why?" Siddharth and I are getting married. When? After I return from Keertan's wedding. Have you really thought about it? Nope. Not at all. Mahima! I swear. Look, I just know that I should not keep him away from me any longer. Nothing else is on my mind. He's given me all that I've missed in the past eight years. What more can I ask for? A 15-day wedding? Is your friend crazy? Siddhu, she is my best friend, and I cannot avoid it. Reunion, Meghalaya trip… bachelorette party, music ceremony, henna ceremony, and so on. So, all of that would take 15 days. She's got me all packed. I have also planned our wedding. -When? -Just now. -How many days? -Just 15 minutes. I don't have the patience for all that. After you return from your friend's wedding, I'll marry you at the first religious place I'll spot. It doesn't matter… if it's a church, a temple or a mosque. Everyone is going to talk about her marriage… but we will talk to everyone about our marriage. Sounds alright. Sounds crazy. Siddhu! Meanwhile, what if someone else proposes to me? You know what to say. VISAKHAPATNAM Please stop for a minute. I had made a perfect plan saying… that my son is a pilot, but it was of no use. -Tell me, Vema. -It's Baabji. There is still one more day. What can you do in a day if you could not do anything in six days? I shouldn't have given you even this much time. Give me my money tomorrow by 11:00 a.m. and take your guy. I killed my father because I had some minor issue with him. So, killing you won't be a big deal for me. Let me talk to Vema once. -Hello. -Hey, Vema. Don't worry. No matter what, I will be there with the money by tomorrow morning. Vema! Hey! Friends, all the apartments of Siddharth Homes… have sold out even before the completion of its construction. -Cheers, guys! -Cheers! -Cheers. -Cheers. Hey, I need some money urgently. I bought a piece of land just a week ago, Aditya. Sorry, it's not possible without security. That Baabji is a very dangerous fellow, Aditya. He does what he says. Take care of Vema. I am learning Bengali, as well. I don't want it to become a problem after our marriage. Hey, why do you seem so upset? Tell me, dear. Gayathri? Sister, Aditya… -it was all a lie. -What do you mean? That woman lied to me for some money. What are you talking about? I would've never imagined something like this even in my wildest dreams! Nothing good can happen in my life. I should've known. Why can't the truth be as beautiful as the lie, sister? Shall we complain to the police? No, sister. She might be a cunning woman… but Aditya is not like that. Had he been greedy, he would have taken the money from me immediately. He didn't do that, so that means, he's a good guy. Right? Mom's health has worsened, and the doctor's advised a surgery. All my money is in an FD. It is difficult to get that out immediately. If you could give me one lakh rupees right now, I'd be grateful. Thanks. I will return it to you in two days. Should I talk to your father? He is not here. It's his night shift. I don't need to ask anyone. This is my money. I had to compromise a lot in order to save the money… but this money gave me hopes for my wedding. This is mine. I am not answerable to anyone. I'll leave now. Aditya! Do you even know what my name is? Thank you. Hey, I'll get going now. This is your party, man! I have a land registration in the morning. I can't be late. You will take care of everything, right? -Yeah. Bye-bye. Take care. -Okay, bye. Sir, the new sub-inspector is talking about all the rules. She was suspended for three months for helping an accused. After that, she got transferred to this station. What are you guys doing? Get out, everyone! Don't you know that you should not contaminate a crime scene? Sorry, ma'am. You guys are simply having a chitchat! Out! -Come, let's go. -Sir! Sir! -Who informed us? -The servant, sir. She came back this morning from her village. After the murder, the body was dumped into the tub with the tap open. The servant turned off the tap after she got here. Any evidence? No, sir. We couldn't even find a small clue. So, do you think that the murderer has forensic knowledge? I am sure he did not use any knife to execute the murder. It's a very sharp object. Point of entry, sir. This is the spot of the murder, sir. Sir, the victim's name is Akash. He doesn't have a mother, and his father stays in the US. Karma. Our hands are already full of existing cases, and now, we have one more. Hey, 201! Hey, Sudhakar! Go. Why don't you use a hearing aid if you can't hear properly? Nothing like that, sir. I can hear well. -We are discussing the case, sir. -Enough! Go, get a pack of cigarette! Okay, sir. -Yamini. -Sir! Please, handle this case. Also, inform his father. Find out if he has any relatives in the city. Yeah, he is my cousin. Please check if any money or jewelry has gone missing. The locker always used to have a lot of cash. That is missing now, so I am sure something has happened. -Where did you get this money from? -What does it matter to you? All you need is money. It is not easy to earn nine lakhs in one night, right? I am just curious to know what you did to get all this money. Hey! Why did you give me the money if you knew I was lying? I knew you were lying… but I realized your necessity. What if I had not returned? What if I had stolen your money? Had you not returned, it would have been easy for me to forget about you… but it'd have been difficult for you to forget about me. What is all this? I am not sure, Aditya. This is new for me, as well. I am done. Will you stay back? The Circle Inspector is not at all interested in this case. He's given me this case as a formality. We have been continuously looking for witnesses… and some evidence, but all in vain. What more can we do, ma'am? Ma'am… the watchman who lives next door had left for his village… citing a marriage, just two days before the incident. His house is also locked. -What about the others? -I have inquired about everyone, ma'am. No one stays here permanently except for people visiting in summers or for fun. In these types of houses, even the people living in the same house wouldn't know if a murder has taken place in their house. Then, how the people living next door or in the opposite house would know? -I am telling-- -What are you discussing? Get in the car. -Sir! -What is it? We have been inquiring about Akash's murder case. On the night of the murder, a birthday party was happening in the house right across the Akash's house. -So what? -The party was thrown… by the house owner's son. He's from Vijayawada. I've called him to the station. -I hope I don't get into any trouble. -Don't worry. We got you here because we had some doubts. Just wait for some time. Come to the point, Yamini. Sir. -This is a selfie with his girlfriend. -So? Please zoom in, and look at the right corner of the picture. It is the exact time frame of Akash's murder… and he is standing in the balcony of Akash's house. I know this person. His name is Siddharth. Former IIT student. Send this picture across all the police stations. -Sir. -Also, find out his present address. Put aside all the other cases… and focus only on this person and this case. -Sir. -Okay? -Yes, sir. -Sir. I've finally got you after a long time! Siddharth? Yes. Hello! Can you hear me? What's happening here? Hello! Anyone there? What are you doing, sir? You'd told me this inquiry will not last more than ten minutes, but you've locked me in since 10:00 a.m. No one here seems to bother about what I have to say. You took my phone, as well. Give me back my phone. What problem did you have with Akash? Akash? -Who is Akash? -R. Akash. Number 31. Sea Breeze Villa. I don't know. Where were you on Sunday night? I was at a party with my colleagues. I heard that you left the party halfway. What was so urgent? I have a land registration in the morning. I can't be late. Nothing was urgent. -I had a slight headache. -Headache? But it seems that you told your friend there was some registration the day after. However, on Monday, you did not go for any registration. We have inquired about all the details. Don't play the fool with us. Sir, you're keeping our bitter past in mind. That's why, you're trying to trap me on purpose. How dare you say that! You left the party at 11:30 p.m. From there… it is a 20 minutes' drive to your home. Then, what the hell were you doing until 3:30 a.m.? I had a flat tire on the way. Where? The CMR Subway. Bhupati, does it take three hours to change a flat tire? It takes maximum half an hour. There was no jack in my car. I kept asking for help from all the people going that way, but nobody cared to stop. Then finally, one guy stopped his car, but he had no jack either. So, he also left. After a long time, a cab guy helped me. Which cab? I did not notice it. Cab number? It was raining, so I could not see it properly. You neither know the type of cab nor the cab number, but someone helped you and left. His story is very interesting, sir. Believe it or not, but that's the truth. Exactly that day, a person named "Akash" was brutally murdered… with a sharp weapon. Here! He was mercilessly stabbed and killed. But why are you telling me all this? Right. Why I'm telling you! It's because you don't know who Akash is. You have no connection with Akash, and you did not go to his house that night. But then, what the hell were you doing in his balcony… exactly at the time of the murder? This single evidence is more than enough. Your life and career are finished. You're dead. I have absolutely no connection with this case! The Circle Inspector is purposefully targeting me! He just wants revenge against me! Give me back my phone! I have the right to speak to my lawyer! Sir, there's a small problem. -What? -Please come with me, sir. Hey! Hey! Sir, he is drunk. We arrested him for drunk driving. We had sent his photo to all our stations. The sub-inspector at Madhurawada Station identified him and sent him here. -Take him to the storeroom. -Yes, sir. Where were you on the second night? I hardly remember what happens two minutes ago. How do you expect me to-- Shut up! Damn it! I'm back to my senses. Answer his question! Give me some time to remember, sir. That day, my friend was not well. He had a high fever, so I was with him. I went to my room after he took his medicines and had dinner. What is your friend's name? Vema. He has an import and export shop on the Bazaar Street. Find out the address and the other details of this friend. Okay, sir. Hey, Sarathy. Come to the station. -Now? -Yes, now. Tell me. It's 36… 24… 36. Hey! Door no. 36, street no. 24, Vizag-36. Address. Isn't that what you asked me? Sir, did you see that? He has a woman's handkerchief in his hand. Hey, is that it or do you have nail polishes and lipsticks as well? Hey! Sorry. Ma'am, is this your handkerchief? You-- Gaurishankar Sharma versus the State of Uttar Pradesh, January 12th, 1990! Gaurishankar? He is talking about some judgment, Pydi. What are you talking about? "Any form of torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is prohibited by the court of law." What is he saying? You didn't hear it or didn't understand it? I heard it, but I didn't understand it. It is against the law to torture a suspect brought in for a mere inquiry. Not just inflicting physical pain, but any inhuman behavior… is also a crime. IPC Section 330. Are you not aware? He's only aware of leaving the office by 5:30 p.m. and going home. Pritpal Singh versus the State of Punjab. Just like this, a sub-inspector unaware of the consequences of physically hurting a suspect was suspended by the court, along with all the other policemen… who were just watching it quietly. No one was spared. Beat him in such a way that it can't be made out. Rigorous imprisonment. Rigorous imprisonment. Ragbir Singh versus the State of Haryana. Don't you know? The head constable, who ordered the other constable to hit a suspect and the other constable, both were given eight years of imprisonment by the court. To date, both the constables… are in the same jail as the accused. Same jail. Sudha… here! Why? I don't want my name to be on the list… of Sudhakar Pasupula versus the State of Andhra Pradesh case. Sorry! -Let's go. -Yes. What is this? Both of them look strikingly same. This is the only evidence we have. If they want, get this picture framed and give it to them. It's worthless. Trust me. Did you file any case against Siddharth? No. I just got him here for an inquiry. He is the managing director of a construction company. I am sure he has a lot of contacts. It is not safe to keep him in custody for long. So, am I supposed to let him go just like that? Should I give him a ride home? -I didn't mean-- -Sarathy! I called you here to help me. I am going to retire in two months. I will not get a better opportunity than this to ruin him. Nagendra… I haven't forgot what happened between you and Siddharth. But as a public prosecutor, I know the practical problems involved in this. The real problem is that you've found a person who looks exactly like Siddharth. Had you found this look-alike first… you could have killed him, and trapped Siddharth in Akash's murder case. That would have closed the case. But this look-alike was found by another police officer. Every detail has been recorded from the time of his arrest to the time he got handed over to you in this station. What do you want me to do now? That murder was committed by either one of the two. -No doubt. -So, one of them is undeniably lying. Today is Friday. The court will be closed on Saturday and Sunday. Both of them have to be presented before the court on Monday morning. You have only two days. Meanwhile, find out who the murderer is. Find out if it's Siddharth or Aditya. Find out! -Yes? -Good morning, sir. -We are the students of a film institute. -Okay. We have planned to make a documentary based on Akash's murder case, sir. Sir, if you don't mind, we need some information. Sorry. -Sir! -Please, sir. Thank you so much, sir. I hope no one will know that I've given you the information. Don't worry, sir. -We will take care of it. -Okay. This is for you to hear… and this is for me to hear. Though there have been many cases in the past, this case is very unique. The Circle Inspector and the Sub-Inspector… didn't let us breathe even for a minute. It feels like it just happened yesterday. I can still feel it. We have to produce both of them in the court on Monday. We just have 48 hours. Within this time, we have to find out who Akash's murderer is. Neither of them should know about each other. Siddharth must think that he is the only suspect… and Aditya must think that he is the only suspect. Start the treatment. Until they tell the truth, don't even give them water. Siddharth is fine to deal with, sir… but Aditya is talking about some old court cases in his defense. Shut up! Just do as I say! -Sir. -Sir. Out! Sarathy… he should not slip away from our hands this time, at any cost. Right. Handle this case properly, but don't make it evident… that you are targeting him. I will take care of the rest. If the murderer is Siddharth, then our track is clear. But if it's Aditya, we will have to think about what has to be done. They should not escape. Take your shirt off. Why, sir? Just take off your shirt! What is that? That's a bruise from a rod at the construction site. Take it off. Hey! Take off your T-shirt! Why can't you say it clearly, sir? What happened there? Idiot! What's that wound? It's from when my bike skid off the road. We've tortured them so much, yet, they're just repeating what they've already said. It's a sheer waste of time to expect them to cough out the truth on their own. Then what else can we do, ma'am? Who is Akash? What is his connection with these two? Who is Akash's murderer out of the two of them? Why was he killed in the first place? Once we get to know more about Akash… it'll be easy for us to find out who the murderer is. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Akash always used to be at home. It's very rare for him to go out. Most of the times, he'd play his video games or he'd play his guitar. He used to be on his computer for hours, sir. Are you and Akash best friends? Back in college, we were in the same music band. We were very close then, but as he left for the US, we lost contact. Why did he return to India? There is no particular reason. He just wanted to come back, so he came back. For a job or anything like that? No… his father used to send him money every month. So, he never even thought of getting a job. Sir, Akash is a very good person. Once, when my son was suffering from dengue, he took care of all the expenses. He didn't even deduct the money from my salary. Love life, girlfriends? No… he was never interested in all that. He told me once about a girl who rejected his proposal in college. He was very reserved when it came to women. Music and games were his only world. Have you seen this guy? Have you seen this person anywhere? No, sir. No. On the night of second, I was suffering from fever. My partner was by my side, taking care of me. Once I took my tablet and went to sleep, he also went to his room, ma'am. He is talking about Aditya, ma'am. Both of them are frauds. Then, aren't any cases filed against them? Aditya's intelligence can be seen in his ways of cheating. His main target is the people, who want to earn money via illegal ways. So, nobody has filed a case against him fearing that they'll also get caught. He was supposed to go to jail in a case recently, ma'am. Aditya rescued him quoting some legal point. What is his educational qualification? -Winter. -What? Inter, ma'am. How can an intermediate passed person have so much legal knowledge? I'd asked him that, ma'am. He said that people should stop poking their nose in other people's lives. You… I Apollo fish if I said something wrong, ma'am. "Apollo fish"? He meant, "apologize," ma'am. Yes. We can say that, as well. We will call you as and when required. You're not allowed to go anywhere until this case is solved. Got it? Okay, ma'am. Don't forgo any information about Aditya. Yes, ma'am. What? Sorry, ma'am. I didn't hear it properly. I will find out from Raghav. -Pydi. -Yes, ma'am. I need the phone records of Aditya, Akash, and Siddharth. -Including Akash's bank statement. -Okay, ma'am. Give me the list of all those people, who had booked a cab that night. You're not allowed to go anywhere until this case is solved. -Got it? -Okay, ma'am. Sir! I have checked all the call data of Siddharth, Aditya and Akash. Siddharth and Aditya have no connection whatsoever with Akash. And what about Siddharth and Aditya? No, sir. All three have very different lifestyles. None of them have any kind of association with the other. Also, I got to know during my inquiry that Akash is a very fair person. He doesn't even have any weakness. His sister said that his locker always used to have a lot of cash. So, I asked for Akash's bank statement to be collected. What about the cab driver? We have informed everyone. -We'll get an answer by tomorrow evening. -Why is it taking so much time? We had only two days, and one day is already gone. I want a piece of strong evidence against Siddharth to prove that he's the murderer! I mean, Siddharth or Aditya. You may go. Yes, sir. We are missing out on a very small detail, Pydi. I know there's something going on, but I'm not able to put my finger on it. What is the issue between Mr. Nagendra and Siddharth? Good evening, ma'am. It's okay, ma'am. It's just Sudhakar. Although, it seems like he can hear us, he can't. What is the problem between the Circle Inspector and Siddharth? Sir Nagendra has one daughter, ma'am. She loved someone during her college days. That boy belonged to a different caste. Sir was against their love, so he fixed his daughter's marriage with someone else. Just two days before the wedding, she eloped with her lover and married him. Siddharth took care of everything, from helping her elope with her lover… to their wedding. Because her lover and Siddharth are very good friends. The highlight is that… sir has no clue where his daughter is, to date. Now, if he's getting a chance to seek his revenge, why wouldn't he take it? Even if Aditya is the murderer, he will try to push it on Siddharth. I've heard it all. Is your caste more important to you than your daughter, Pydi? How could you say that? You don't know your daughter's whereabouts. How is that a "highlight"? Ma'am, please make him understand. What kind of a man are you! See how he misunderstood everything! Unless we get some additional evidence… we can't do anything about this, Pydi. Hello! Hello, Yamu. This is Purushotham. Who gave my number to Purushotham? I did, because he wanted to talk to you about the case. I had changed my number because of his constant nagging. Sorry, ma'am. "I had changed my number because of his constant nagging." Isn't that what you just said? I could sense it. I am in a tense situation. Tell me, why did you call me? I had-- I'm on a personal call. I'd called you to tell you that you need not be tensed anymore. -Why? -Akash's case has been solved. -What? -It's exactly what you just heard. Akash's case has been solved. -What are you talking about? -It's the truth! Before I tell you this truth, I need to know something. What is it? Why did you reject… my marriage proposal three months back? If you're going to ask me such idiotic questions at this time, I'll have to use some cuss words! -What? -I wasn't talking to you. I know you wouldn't say that to me. Anyway, I'll come to the point. My team has collected a hair sample from the murder spot. Of the murderer? Of course! You must be aware… that we have already tested the DNA from the hair samples of everyone associated with Akash. Nobody's DNA matched with the DNA of the hair sample found at the spot. Who else is left then? So, if you send the hair sample of the suspect immediately… the case will be solved by tomorrow morning. -Pydi. -Ma'am! We've got the additional evidence. No matter what the crime is, no matter how clever the culprit is… he is bound to be found at some point. He got caught with the help of just a strand of his hair. We did not expect this case to be solved so easily. Siddharth and Aditya's hair samples were sent to the lab. Hey! Move! Hey, what is it? I need to use the men's room. All right! What are you looking at? Hey! Hey! Open the door! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Hey! Catch him! Hey! Hey, stop! Hey! Sir, Aditya and Siddharth are fighting with each other! Come quickly, sir! Hey! Hey! -Did you call the Assistant Sub-Inspector? -Yes, sir! He is on the way! Stop them! Stop him! Hey! Stop it! -Let go of him right now! -Hey, stop it! Let go! If I hit you, your nose will be squashed. Hey! Hey, push him aside! I am sure he is the murderer. Else, why would he try to escape? Sit down! Oh, God! Your nose got squashed as he hit you. Sudha… it must be by mistake. He hit you without missing an inch. -Really? -Sir! -Yes? -Did you realize something? -What? -They already know each other. And they hate each other, as well. They hate each other. Morning, Yamu! -I was expecting you. -What happened? You look like a perfect bride even in your uniform. I tested the hair samples as soon as I received them. The DNA from the murder spot and the DNA… from the sample you sent, matched perfectly. I wanted to call you and inform the same, -but-- -What? Although, I'd got the confirmation from the first sample… I also checked the second sample as a formality. And the twist is… not only the sample from the first suspect… but the sample from the second suspect also matched perfectly with the hair sample found at the spot! -Are there two suspects? -Yes. Are they identical? If their DNAs are also the same, then both the suspects in your custody are… Identical twins! I was born 15 seconds after Siddharth was born. Even a father and a son have different DNAs, -then-- -Correct. Not just a father and a son, even normal twins have different DNAs… but identical twins are two lives formed from the same egg. So, they not only look the same, but their DNAs are also the same. So, there is no use of this evidence. The moment I'd got the photo as the evidence, I thought the case was solved. But then, we found one more guy! No matter how much we torture them, neither of them is ready to accept the crime. What else can be there other than a DNA? Here, I was thinking the case has been solved. -Now, what? -Hey, don't worry. There is another option. -What is it? -Fingerprints. Though, they are the identical twins with the same DNA… their fingerprints ought to be different. My team's checked the crime scene. Had they found any fingerprints, they'd have sent them to you. I know how your team looks for the clues. Coffee. You may go. This time, I will check the crime scene. Where is the point of entry? That way. The point of exit? It'd be the same as the point of entry, right? Why? Look! When he was entering, there might not have been anyone on the road… but as he was exiting, there could have been someone… which made him take another exit. And this could be the exit. Maybe, the fingerprints we are searching for are right here. Give me the gloves. "If you love a person lovingly…" "If you love a person lovingly… the person who'll get your love, will also love you lovingly!" How's it, Yamu? What happened? Didn't you like it? I felt… the same, actually-- He wrote this. I'd told him that it's bad. Such an outdated fellow. Yamini, I have a tricky question for you. Marriages are made in… Heaven! No. That is where I saw your beautiful profile picture. I know you are blushing. I think, the murder happened on the upper floor… but he fled down from here. I am not sure. You said that the point of entry and the point of exit need not be the same. Then, why would he come down to flee? He could have left from the upper floor. Correct! I think, it is better to follow your point of view. Isn't that common sense? -If we don't even know that-- -Shut up! First, learn to make some good coffee! Then, give an advice! Take the cup! Bloody loser! What are you doing in the forensics? -What are you doing? -Yamu. As per the forensics, it'd be better if we think like a police officer in this particular case. Else, the case cannot be solved. A waste fellow! -I know you're not talking about me. -I am! My parents had a love marriage. My mother's parents were against it. She still married my father against her family's wish. My mother was a bank employee… and my father was a lawyer. Just after a few years into the marriage, my parents started having compatibility issues. -What does it mean? -Difference of opinions. Why don't you understand? You don't have to earn and support this family! Just stay home, and take care of the kids! Why don't you answer me? I'm shouting at the top of my lungs! Have you gone mad? Why do you want a divorce all of a sudden? Bharati, think twice before you make a decision. It's not going to be of any use… even if I think it over a 100 times. Nothing can change my decision. I left with my father. I left with my mother. I love you, dear. I love you too, Mom. Wow! Thank you, Mom! That is fine… but I heard that your mom was addicted to poker. Tell me about it. It is refreshing to hear about it. Did he tell you about this? -He is dead! -Hey! -Hold him! -Hey, stop! -Hey! -Hold him tight! -You… -Hey, sit! Sit down! Don't let go of him! Hold him tight! -Hey, stop! -Hey! Sit down! Sit down. It's not easy for a woman to play poker in a male-dominated club. I know mothers who take their children to schools, tuition, etc… but for the first time, I'm hearing about a mother who would take her kid to a club. My mother was a university gold medalist! As she graduated, she was offered a job as a bank officer. My mother wouldn't think twice to help those in need. Couldn't that rascal tell you this? How could you eat just anything! -See! Now, you got sick. -I was hungry, Mom. I am sorry, son. I will not go to the club from tomorrow onward. Okay? Dad and I could never understand why she got addicted to the club. What is there not to understand? My mother was not happy with the way her life turned out after marriage. Grief and anger. They're not gender-specific. How many of you buy clothes and biscuits for your children? Do your children hate you because of that? Mom. No matter how hard I try, I am unable to get rid of this habit. I am deeply burdened. I lost. I lost the entire salary of this month. I don't know what's going on with me. But why are you more interested in our past than Akash's case? First of all, find out what you ought to know. Siddharth is a compulsive liar. He can only lie. He is not as naive as he looks. He got a psychiatric treatment for a year. Didn't he say that to you? Me? Call the Hyderabad Erragadda Hospital and find out, sir. Find out who was at the hospital… getting a treatment from June 2006 to June 2007. I am sure they will tell you. Call them and find out. I also want you to do that. He ruthlessly stabbed the chief doctor there with a fork he was eating with. Half the fork was pierced into his neck. He was hospitalized for a month. He was almost dead. Me? Sir, call them and find out who did it! Then, you'll have a clear picture of this murder case as well. You are right, ma'am. He was the son of a lawyer. He stabbed the doctor out of anger for what the doctor said. What's his name? I don't know, ma'am. This incident happened about 12 years ago. I've just joined four years ago. I heard it from someone here, ma'am. What happened to the doctor? He was stabbed in the throat, so he could not talk anymore. He died a year ago. I'm sure you note down the details of the patients when they're admitted. Right, ma'am… but there had been a fire incident in the building, so all the files got burnt. A few files are in the storeroom. I'll try to find out and call you back, ma'am. -Okay, ma'am? -All right. -Tell me. -I'm totally blank, Sarathy. I'm unable to understand anything. I was just doing your work. I seem to have found a way out of this. Give me some time. I'll call you back. What is Aditya's problem? He was already disturbed when he came to live with us after our mother's death. He was temperamental, disturbed… and frustrated. We were unable to comprehend the situation. How did your mother die? Jaundice… as stated by my father. How did your mother die? Jaundice. He is lying, Pydi. Aditya knows the truth about his mother's death. Even Siddharth doesn't know about it. How could she do this despite having a kid! Why should we bother? Leave it. True. Mom! You are Bharati's son, right? Your mother and I are colleagues. She got unconscious in the club, so I took her to a doctor. The tablets are on the table. If you need anything, ask your mother to call me. Okay? Bye. Wait a minute, dear. There is nothing wrong with me the way you're thinking. Your mother is not that kind of a woman. I grew up in a house, where I could not be myself. I didn't have any scope to express my anger. My father's mentality was such that… he'd always judge me on the basis of what other people talked about me. I couldn't take it. I felt like flying away into the wilderness, but right then, your father came into my life. We got married, and I thought that was the end of my slavery. But later, I found out… that I flew out of one cage just to end up into another. Earlier, I was unable to question my father. After marriage, I couldn't answer the questions of your father. I took you along, and got out of that relationship. Then, I realized that I'd just got out of it physically, but the grief and anger within me still remained. We often forget that… grief and anger are not gender-specific. Eventually, because of that, I got drowned in my bad habit. I thought, "At least, let me win a game." Such was my stubbornness. All that made me a slave. But when I realized… my son has been crying in the middle of the night… because of me, I thought, that's enough. My father or your father might be responsible for the failure of my life… but I am the one responsible for your life. I swear… I will not go back to the club. I love you, my dear. I will not go to work today. Don't go to play football after school today. Come home directly. I will make your favorite dessert. After that, we will go shopping. Okay? I just changed my path, because I did not like the path that I was on. But dear, your mother never chose the wrong path. Promise me that you'll come home directly. Please, trust me. If you think I am telling the truth, you'll come home directly after school. Don't go to play football. After my mother passed away, my father got Aditya to stay with us. I could sense a kind of inferiority complex in him… when he saw the things I had, but he didn't. My father never bothered to take care of me. Though, we were close physically, I never felt close to him. Siddharth never treated me like his brother. I realized that I could not call it my "home" without my mother. He would act according to his whims and fancies. No matter which college he'd join, he'd be given a transfer certificate by that college. Aditya. -Aditya! -Hey! -Get down! -Let go of me! What are you doing? You are just like your mother, living a dirty life! How dare you say that about my mother! How dare you slap my father! -How dare you slap my father! -Siddharth, control yourself! -Stop it, Siddharth! -How dare you! Dad, let go of me! Get up! Stop it! -You… -Siddharth, stop it! Hey, Aditya! Stop! Both of you! Stop it! Have you guys lost it? Stop it! Get up! Stop it! Are you guys crazy? -Hey! -Hey, stop! Do you want to kill each other? My mother should've been alive! You both should've been dead instead! Aditya, wait! My father wanted me to take up a career in law, like him… but I chose engineering. Aditya took up law. Not because he loved our father, but because he hated me. I realized this when he left the law school within a year. He always wanted to stay ahead of me. I know three languages, so he learned six languages. He came home only when he needed money. Dad expired when I was in the final year of my college. After Dad died, we had nothing to do with each other. We went our separate ways. I also thought the same… but I realized recently that he has been following me. I started my own construction firm… after I cleared my engineering exam with a good rank. My life was sorted, both, personally and professionally. I was very happy. Aditya could not bear it… because his life was a total disaster. Unclear and hopeless. To add to it, he drinks, smokes, and gambles. He has a very different opinion on women. The only obsession he has in his life is… me. I knew he would try to disturb my life, one way or the other. -Hello. -Hey! I am unable to find the diamond ring that I got for Mahima. What? I am sure he is behind all this. Do we know anyone from the police? Yeah, I will take care of it. Listen… don't do it officially. Yes. I got it. It's them, Siddhu. We tried our best, sir… but if we push too hard, he may die. There is no connection between him and the ring, sir. Okay. You can leave. Open the drawer in your cupboard. Do you see the ring? I'd left a photo of our mother there. I'd come to take it back. I just realized today that I have so many body parts, after you got me beaten up. I already had such deep hatred toward you. You've made another mistake today. Now, the hatred has got more intensified. You made me realize that we share the same blood. Now, I'll make you realize the same. After that incident, I directly saw him today. So, keeping that incident in mind, he is trying to trap me in this case. Ma'am, I think he is telling the truth. Sir, he is lying. Why would he try to escape if he is not the murderer? -Yes, Sarathy. -Hey, Nagendra! We've found a way to trap Siddharth. Thank you. Our work is done. Quickly come to my office. Sir, Mr. Bhupati. Mr. Nagendra has called you both. Sudha, we'll be back. Hey, he's called us. -Raghav. -Yes, ma'am? -Why has he called them? -I don't know, ma'am. -He just told me to call them. -Okay, go. Okay, ma'am. You have told us many things, but still, you haven't answered Mr. Nagendra's one question. You left the party citing a registration… but you didn't go for any registration the next day. Why? It's okay, you can tell me. 98824… 88431. Shweta. Mr. Nagendra's daughter. It's her phone number. Yes, my husband and I had come to Vizag to see Siddharth. We talked to him. He understood our financial problem and helped us. -What happened? -Nothing. Mr. Nagendra will leave no stone unturned… in order to find them. So, I did not reveal anything. -Where is Mr. Nagendra? -We don't know, ma'am. He was speaking to someone over the phone and then, he left with Bhupati and Sudhakar. -Pydi. -Yes, ma'am. Can anyone of you open a door without a key? We all can do that, ma'am. Search for the car keys. Okay, ma'am. Ma'am, do you still not believe Siddharth? He said that it took him three hours to get back to home on the night of the murder because his car tire had got punctured, but we have no evidence to prove that. -All the cab services-- -Ma'am! Car keys! Now, we'll get to know whether Siddharth's telling the truth or no. I had a flat tire on the way. He's telling the truth, ma'am. The car has a flat tire. -Hey, if the police come here-- -Police? Tell them that you were sick on the night of second, and that I looked after you. They'll leave but before they come back, you have to escape. Keep traveling for two-three days without any halts. What about the police? Why are you asking me to run away? What did you do? From where you got the money that you gave to Baabji? No questions! Do as I say! Don't you check the fuel in the vehicle? Sorry, ma'am. I'll get it in five minutes. -Be quick! -Okay, ma'am. Okay, Raghav. Ma'am. What is it, Pydi? I am sure Aditya is the murderer. Aditya withdrew 11 lakhs from his account… just four days before Akash's death. And the very next day, he repaid his friend, Vema's loan to Baabji. Nine lakhs with interest. To add to this, Vema has fled from the city yesterday, ma'am. Mr. Nagendra had already got this information in the evening. They did not reveal it to you as they didn't want their plan to fail, ma'am. -What plan? -Ma'am, on the very day of the murder, there had been a robbery at a jewelry shop on the Bazaar Street. No one knows who the culprit is. It is an unsolved case. So, Mr. Nagendra wants to mislead this case by framing Aditya in that robbery case. Put your finger there. Keeping his personal vengeance in mind… Mr. Nagendra wants to trap Siddharth in this murder case. This is his master plan. Put your finger there. Why, sir? -It's for your own good-- -Wait. The 11 lakhs… in Akash's locker went missing after his murder… and the very next day, you gave nine lakhs to Baabji, and repaid your friend, Vema's loan. This one point is more than enough to prove that you are the murderer. I won that money in the game of poker, sir. What? I won those nine lakhs in the game of poker. Ratanlal. We play poker once every month at our guest house. Minimum amount for the entry is one lakh, sir. Aditya was here on the night of second, sir. He played all through the night and earned ten lakhs. Will you say this in the court as it is? I will, sir. The Assistant Commissioner of Police also comes to our guest house. Thank you, sir. Sir. The case has been solved. Siddharth is the culprit. Okay. The case has been solved. Aditya is the culprit. Along with your ears, have you lost your mind as well? I'd got a call from the station, sir. I hope you remember that Siddharth had told us a cab driver helped him for his punctured tire that day. That cab driver is at our station right now, sir. Sir, why are you not reacting to-- Sir! We have already informed all the cab services. We've almost inquired all of them. Rest of them who haven't been inquired, are coming to the station. He'd gone to Hyderabad two days ago. Just one hour ago, he came to the station, sir. This cab driver helped Siddharth with his car's punctured tire. Is the information genuine? Yes, sir. The owner told us that Aditya… was indeed at their guest house playing poker on the night of the murder. So, Aditya hasn't killed Akash. Also, the cab driver is the witness… for when Siddharth's car had a punctured tire. He had helped him on the night of the murder. So, it's not Siddharth who killed Akash. There is no other option but to present them in the court. Only the court has to decide. After all of this, we were back to square one! We had no clue what was happening. The case went on for seven months. And finally, the day of judgment arrived. CC 220/2019! Aditya and Siddharth! We didn't expect that the court would give such a verdict. There is no doubt that… one of you is the murderer. But the prosecution has failed… to prove who that murderer is. Don't you think the law wants to punish the real culprit? But what can we do if we have no idea who that is? The law cannot punish the both of you… because one of you is innocent. "Doesn't matter if a hundred culprits escape, but not a single innocent person should be punished." This is the first rule of the law. I have to give the judgment based on the evidence presented to me. TRUTH ALWAYS WINS Are you the one who investigated this case? Yes, Your Honor! It's a black mark for your department. In Akash's case, the guilty could not be proved. Therefore, both the suspects, Siddharth and Aditya… are set free. Sir, did they really release the both of them? Yes. But sir, who exactly is guilty of the crime? We don't know. -We have no clue. -We don't know. Ma'am, we are moving everything to the upper floor. -Do you want your files to be moved? -Okay. I'd asked you to put this picture back in Siddharth's house! Sorry, ma'am. It skipped my mind. I'll send it back with Raghav. Oh, that girl. The case went on for seven months, but she didn't come to see Siddharth even once. I'd asked him about this girl when I found this picture in his house. He told us that she broke up with him, because we charged him and put him in jail. What happened, ma'am? What are you thinking about? The first time we brought in Siddharth for questioning… we had showed him our photo evidence. Do you remember? Pydi… do you remember? Yes, ma'am. He kept quiet when he saw the photo then. He did not even talk about his twin brother. We are missing out on a very small detail, Pydi. I know there's something going on, but I'm not able to put my finger on it. -Hello? -Yamini here. MVP Station Sub-Inspector. Yes, ma'am. You'd told me about a girl, whom Akash loved back in college. Yes. What is her name? Mahima. Mahima was supposed to be in Kolkata for her friend's wedding, but she never got there. I tried many times to call her, but her phone was always switched off. Siddharth, sorry to say this… and I am not sure if it's right for me to tell you this, but the situation is such that I have to tell you. I got to know that… she left Vizag with some guy, and they got down at the next station. It seems that they were very close. I know Mahima very well. She is not that kind of a girl. Siddharth, someone I know saw them together! I am telling you for your own good. Don't waste your time. Forget about her. Do you know… who that guy is? Akash. He was in Mahima's college. I spiked Mahima's drink. When she was unconscious, I took her with me. I injected drugs into her. I got physical with her for two days in a row. Nobody ever says "no" to me! Then, I killed her with a drug overdose. I gave ten lakhs to the police… to make sure they don't file any case against me! She kept saying your name until her last breath. Ma'am. This report has been sent by the Hyderabad Erragadda Hospital. They did not get the exact details we asked for, but they've sent the papers related to Siddharth and Aditya from the chief doctor's files. So, who was taking the treatment? Siddharth or Aditya? Both. Yes, ma'am. Siddharth was there for three months, and Aditya was there for a year. They both had got into a deadly fight with each other when they were 16. Please read the last line of that report by the chief doctor, ma'am. That explains it all. "Though they hate each other to the core… if they come across any problem… they both become one." When you tried to stop me when I was escaping from the police station, I thought you did it out of your anger toward me. But I realized later that you'd come to help me. I knew your focus was entirely on Akash ever since… you planned to kill him. You were being careful to make sure you don't leave any evidence… but you weren't following the investigation. I was following it, though. Because of that photo evidence, you got caught with no way out. Airtight case. You'd have got either a life imprisonment or a death sentence. I realized that you can get out of the case only if I get in. Hey, stop! Sir, catch him! Hey, stop! Hey, you come along. We'd sent his photo across all our stations, so the sub-inspector of Madhurawada Station identified him and sent him here. I knew that Nagendra will go to any extent with a vengeance to trap you. You're dead. He is the circle inspector. He can do anything. I had to find a source to stop him. That's when I got to know… about Yamini. What happened, ma'am? I entered the police station only after I got all the information about her. As soon as Aditya entered the police station… he started playing mind games with me. He made sure that I keep my focus on him… by diverting my attention away from Siddharth. He diverted me. Idiot! She'd got suspended for three months for helping an accused in one case. Though, she's a very sincere officer… her basic nature is very mild. I knew she'd be of great help to us if I managed to trap her in my plan… and I was right. No one should know that I arranged the cab driver. It should stay between us. What if she reopens the case once she realizes the truth? She must've realized it already, but she can't do anything about it now. Because she's the one, who arranged the fake evidence for you. If she reopens the case, she'll not only lose her job but also be charged for the crime. So, the case ends at Yamini's end. Who played the game, ma'am? Tell me. I don't have anything to say. At the hospital, both of us were punished as no one knew who between the two of us had stabbed the chief doctor. But when it comes to the law, it's different. This was the biggest and the riskiest gamble of my life, but it was worth the risk. I won the game. Why did you risk your life for me? Not for you, I did it for our mom. You don't know much about our mother. Whenever she used to buy a shirt for me, she used to buy one for you as well. She'd always cry whenever she'd miss you. Though she was happy that I was with her, she always felt your absence more. We are two different people only for this world, but not for our mom who showed us this world. Had she been alive today, she'd have expected me to help you… exactly the way I did. When I didn't know where to go or what to do, I found the right path to tread. That path is Gayathri. I want to marry her, and start my life afresh. What about you? I am going to Mumbai, and from there to Copenhagen. I don't intend to come back. Probably, this is our last meeting. In silence, I seek your presence Please come with me It's morning already But I am asleep dreaming about you Pay heed, I am your heartbeat Do you have to stress That I see you as me? Shall we find a place Where no one can find us? And let our souls twine as one Everyone lives alone But from now onward We'll live our life together What happened? My grandfather couldn't understand my mother. My dad couldn't understand my mother. As a son, I couldn't understand her either. Had I understood her… she would have been with us today. I lost her. A woman should've authored the Ramayana, Gayathri. If that would have happened, the idea of doubting… a woman's fidelity would have ended. I promise that I'll try to understand you… because that's all I can do now. I am ready to lay down my heart for you
