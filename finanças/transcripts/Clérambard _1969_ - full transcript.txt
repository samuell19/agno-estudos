Opening bid: 600 francs. Any advance? 700. 700 once, 700 twice. 750. 750 once, twice... - 800. - 800. 800 once, twice, three times... Going, gone. Going, gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. - Going, gone. - No! Hold on there! You should be ashamed! I'll shoot you. That's my dog. You don't shoot someone's dog! - They've nothing to eat. - They've nothing left. Come here, kitty. - He'll have to sell the château. - He's mortgaged to the roof. Land foreclosure sale Your Lordship, it isn't yours this time. I'm just a solicitor. I'm told to sell, so I sell. It's not yours! My basin. What are you doing? The Lobster. The Lobster... The Lobster... - How much is it? - 6 francs. 100 sous for soldiers. How much have you got? 40 sous. You? I've got 3.50 francs. That's enough for one. - Heads. I won. - I never said tails. Hey, Buzard! Tell me all about it. Get to work quick, darling. I've had enough. I don't want to go up there. We've all had enough. Your father is having a bad day. If he sees you lounging about, he'll get angry. Getting angry is what your husband does best. It keeps him busy. That's unfair, mother. Hector is working himself to death. He's irritable because he's tired, worried, hounded. He treats us like cattle. Like galley slaves. And this child... Why did I have the misfortune of being born? Being born Vi... Viscount Clérambard? If my name was Martin or Moreau, I wouldn't live like a slave in this old château. Oh, to be a shop assistant, a manservant, eat until I'm full, go to the café, go out... Mother... Be... be a gas man... Oh, Mother... I killed a cat. It's in the kitchen. We'll eat it tonight. Cat again? Yes, cat again. That's the third time this week. Your mother is very difficult. We're poor, I know. "Poor" doesn't cover it, but we don't have to eat cats. You're being stupid, my dear, as usual. I've sold everything to keep this place. I've sentenced my family to hard labour. Going to bed at 2, up at 5. I have to knit, pack, deliver... Now I can't eat cats? Hector, darling... - You all hate me. - Come on, Hector! Ask my mother-in-law, ask my son. Don't you? I... I love you. - You're not peeling? - I'm not peeling. No potatoes for you. I'm not eating cat either. You can have mine. In 1457, winter 1457, my ancestor Onuphre de Clérambard, under siege in Blémont, ate rats. Octave? Thanks. Yes, thanks or no, thanks? No, thanks. Rat and owl. Owl. If he'd had enough to eat, he wouldn't have surrendered. Louise? No, thanks. If your ancestor ate rats and owls, it's because he was besieged. I'm besieged too. Besieged by creditors, mortgage lenders, bailiffs, deficits. The situation is getting worse. Louise. We can't keep up. So sell this draughty old house which is big enough for 50. It's been in my family for 400 years. Isn't that long enough? When you own something for 4 centuries, you get fed up with it. Octave? He's unwell. Octave? Back to your places. Back to your places! Did you hear me? Better? Come on... Get to work. He's in no state to work. Octave is lazy. He needs a shake. Brute. Monster. He's exhausted. He's your son. My son? Sickly and idle? A school failure? I had hoped, for the honour of the Clérambards, he'd fight in the colonies. But not my son. He's 21, and he's knitting. Badly. 2 o'clock. Leave your work. Go to bed. Not you. Finish that pullover. You don't faint at work. Repeat it. "You don't faint. "at work." Monster. Pardon? Nothing. Mother, in all the years we've been married, I've never regretted marrying Hector. - Not going to bed? - No. I'm going to have some fun. 111 mufflers. 32 pullovers at 10 francs. Packaging: 3.20 francs. 90 francs. Transport: 5.50... If only you'd had more children! - Well, I say... - If I had 9 children knitting for 10 hours a day, in 2 years, I could pay for a new roof. In 4 years... After my dog, it's my cat? I'm telling you. The next shot... So you didn't kill my cat? Killing cats and dogs... And with my gun! Octave! No, not you. You see what he's like. The man is suffering. Father, I suppose you go to the Château de Clérambard? He doesn't like visitors. Father, I need you. Solicitor Would they accept a Galuchon girl? - What? After you. - Thank you. Which of your three daughters do you mean? - My eldest. - I don't know her. You don't know Evelyne? I don't want to mention a figure, but my father amassed a fortune in the horse trade. So I've heard. You could also remind them that Mrs Galuchon was a Cudenault. - Cudenault the grocers, yes. - There you are. Yes. My daughter's dowry... Yes, of course. - And then the château... - Yes, quite. - A little drink? - Yes. Obviously Evelyne isn't... Well... Her sisters are prettier. Much prettier than her. - But she isn't...? - No! She's very well brought up. Curtsey and then leave us, darling. - Is that her? - Yes. Excuse me. Father, come in, please. Father. How is the young viscount? Not great. He's a little tired. Octave? Octave, Father is asking how you are. Father... I can see you're busy. Our situation hasn't improved. God tests those whom he has particularly chosen. He really is too good to us. Maybe your hardships will end. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Do you know Mr Galuchon, the solicitor in rue Fantin? - Your Lordship. - Will you be long? I took the liberty... You can stay, but don't stop people from working. - We don't have time for prayers. - Hector! - Sit down, Father. - Thank you. I took the... We used to receive people, but now... The grandfather was a horse dealer, the uncle is an ironmonger. But that means a good dowry. Whilst the young lady in question isn't really ugly, she's far from pretty. And in consolation, the parents want to make her a viscountess. She's very well educated, and in addition to the dowry, Mr Galuchon says he'll clear all the loans on the château. Louise, we have to accept, no matter what your husband thinks. Octave is of age. He should marry and leave. The very idea, Mother! I'd have exhausted myself so that someone can buy us out? No. Octave, what do you think? Say something. M... Marry me, Mother. Marry me right away. I... I want to leave! My wife could be bald, one-eyed or toothless, she'd still be pretty to me, since I wouldn't have to knit pullovers. - I want to leave! - That's clear enough. You'd accept being part of the Galuchon family, the Viscount de Clérambard, and have an ironmonger for an uncle? Better than a father who's a beggar. I want to leave! Octave... Marry then, my poor child. My life has been a failure. Sunday afternoon, Mr Galuchon and his family... Filthy beast! I chased it into the loft. Didn't you hear the barking? Do you mean my dog? I left it outside. It's dead. What? Poor Papillon... What happened? I strangled it with a rope. You had no right! I had every right. This is my property. I strangled it for fun. I'll put it in the salting room. The corpse belongs to me. Take it away, then! Go and bury it in your garden. - That's the end of it. - You're awful. Hector, that's disgraceful. That's enough! Back to work! - Who are you? - I'm Saint Francis of Assisi. Whilst passing, I heard the cries of a dying dog. I came to see. Poor beast, and poor man too. Read this book about my life. Think about it. And try and live a better life than you have so far. I've lost a good friend who loved me. - Did you see that monk? - What monk? A monk. Wearing a coat. - Did you see him? - No. Was he outside? No! He was... You didn't see a monk? - You were dreaming. - No! I'm sure I saw him! I should go. I bid you good evening. Octave, show the Father out. I couldn't be more upset if it were my own dog. I'll miss him. Papillon! That's my dog. He's alive. Yes... Yes, yes, it's you. Yes, yes. Your Lordship, you scared me. Me? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes, it's your master. Yes... I won't leave you again. Papi... Oh... You've got a... a velocipede, Father? Yes. It was... It was a present. Your jokes are in poor taste. You seem exhausted. Are you unwell? Unwell? No. - More... - Tired? We all are. We won't manage unless we get help. Hector, the priest came about a marriage between Octave and Mr Galuchon's eldest. Yes. But you did see the monk? He was carrying a book. Why are you going on about this monk? - A monk wearing a coat. - Why would I have seen him? And this book? It didn't get here by itself. Can you see this book? Yes. Have you been buying books? With what money? And the dog? The priest's dog. Look where you're going. Release the brake! Hey! Where's the pullover factory! That's it. Good. That's it. There's a large dowry. He would clear all the loans on the château. Why not agree? Why not? Are you listening? What? Come in. Hello, everyone! Don't all speak at once. To whom do I have the honour? "The honour"... They call me the Lobster, because I have freckles on my stomach. My name is Léonie Vincent. "The Vincent girl", as the police say. A right slut, the shame of the town. - What brings you here? - I want to buy a pullover. We don't sell them. We do work for good causes. No. We work because we're destitute. You never tell people that. Who told you? A common acquaintance. We have a common acquaintance? If you had my experience, you wouldn't be surprised. Sorry, Your Ladyship. I'm embarrassed. You're going to ask why I have a basin. No. I wouldn't ask. Well you see, I had a mishap. I had a basin in my room, on the floor. I don't have a table. You know how it is, a girl can't have everything. My basin was on the floor... But that's a detail. Please. I had a soldier this afternoon. A young man from a good family, well educated... A nice soldier. As he was putting his trousers on, he tripped and put his foot in the basin. We don't need to know. That's why I had to buy another basin. A woman can't do without one, for washing herself or her underclothes. Hector, this is unacceptable. Not in our house. What do you want? - I want to buy a pullover. - Go and choose one, quick. At least someone's keen. Oh... I like this one. Hold on. It looks alright. Shows off my chest. - How much is it? - 12 francs. What? 12 francs? That's a bit much. I might look distinguished, but it's only on the surface. That one's horrid. Anatole, Anatole Too small, too expensive, too ugly. It isn't easy. Anatole, Anatole Show your pistols This isn't a music hall. Serve this person and get rid of her. Anatole And Anatole's girl Make me an offer. Really? I like you. - Make me an offer. - How about 7.50? No, that isn't enough. What about 9 francs? I can go up to 9.50. No more. - 9 francs is fine. - Oh, thank you. Here's 9. Thank you. I'd like to put it on right away. My basin! I nearly forgot my basin. Oh, Your Lordship. It's nice to know some people still have manners. It's quite rare, believe me. Right, then. Goodbye, everyone. Oh, my goodness! A man. Don't be embarrassed. Hold this. Yes. Yes. I hope you won't say anything. If my fiancé saw us, or my parents, my friends, my staff... Thanks. Bye, cutie. The Lobster... The Lobster! The Lobster! The Lobster! It was her. The Lobster! She spoke to me. She looked at me. It was The Lo... - What's the matter with you? - She was right there. I... I saw her stomach. I... I could feel her chest. Her chest! It's OK. Calm down. Calm down? I've been thinking about her for years, dreaming of being with her. Each time I go past, I stop, my legs go weak, I breathe in the smell of the corridor. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. I don't know why I'm telling you. - Why would you care... - You did right. I'm your father. I'm going to marry one of the Galuchon girls. The ugliest one, but still... The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi? - You're reading that? - Why not? Francis of Assisi, if I remember, was the monk who loved animals. And animals loved him. Are you sure? Well... I'm going to work. No. Go and help your mother with dinner. We won't work tonight. Off you go! Leave me alone. "In 1182 in Assisi was born "the person who would become Saint Francis. "Warbler, cuckoo, tit, "oriole, blackbird, nightingale: "gentle animals, my brothers. "When I'm in the towns, "I'll tell people to come and see you in the woods. "I'll tell them it's not enough to love your fellows "and that you have to love other beautiful creatures "with voices of paradise and wings like God's angels. "The forest is like paradise lost. "God didn't want the garden to be destroyed by the first sin. "Across the earth, "he sowed deep forests where the sinner could find luck "among the animals who saw his innocence. "Ah, it's the wolf. "Hello, brother. Hello. "You seem unhappy. "Come on, don't look so miserable, poor wolf. "I know you've eaten another lamb. "It's the way of the world. "When you eat a lamb, you celebrate God's glory. "You sing His strength and goodness. "The song sounds harsh to men's ears, "but to God, it is no less gentle "than the sound of birds eating insects. "Brother wolf, listen to the birds' song. "It is yours. "That is how God sees your howling. "Listen, wolf." It's not normal. He can do what he wants on Sundays. He's been in his room since the day before yesterday. He hasn't eaten or slept. He won't see anyone. Father isn't lost, we know where he is. Children! Darling! Oh, my goodness! It's horrible. Mother! - What's wrong? - My God! - Is it Hector? - Yes. He's dead. My husband is dead! Octave! No. Your husband is fine. I was getting ready for Mass. I knocked on his door. You know what he said? - No. - He said... - I can't repeat it. - I'll go. What... What did he say? He said... - I can't. - Whisper it. I know you're in there. Answer me. Say something. Mother, know what he said to grandmother? Yes. I know. Your Ladyship. Off to Mass on your own with just your umbrella? Wait for me. I'm coming down. I'm closed until 4 o'clock on Sundays. So, how have you been? I told you it was flattering. I bet you knitted this one. - Mind the step. - Stop... Stop bothering me, please. Slow down, we're not catching a train. Hello, you. How's it going? Hello yourself! Lobster, you look lovely. Bye, Lobster. Hello, madam. Alright? Out with your mum? Aren't they handsome? Men in the sunshine, it makes me cry. Oh, no. Not you, Your Lady... Take it. Take it, my poor man. I'll take it up to him. - He'll end up... - If he says what he said earlier... Mother. I'm not begging him to eat. Our guests are due. I'm going to pick some flowers from the fields. Octave. Me? - But I... - Go on. Hector! He's mad! He's gone mad! Hector. I was so worried. What have you been doing for 2 days? I was reading and thinking. Thinking about what? Myself and the others. Mother! A spider! - On the billiard table. - It's huge. I'll kill it. Leave it alone. No. Leave it alone, I said. What's come over you? It's a spider. Yes. A spider. What next? Don't all creatures deserve to live? Why would you kill a spider? To keep the house clean. Keep it clean, but leave the spiders alone! Spider, my sister, welcome to our home. Hector, that's revolting. No, you're not a revolting creature. You have a lovely oval body. You're as delicate as a silk thread. - Right? - Certainly. You're my greatest delight. You're more precious than my wife. Charming. What's got into you? The wisdom of the heavens. From now on, I will be a friend to all animals, spiders and all! You go from one extreme to the other. He's mad. What about the Galuchons? Hector! There, my little sister. This is your home. These creatures are delightful. Why are you being so kind to spiders, when you kill cats and dogs? Louise, I understand. I did kill cats and dogs. I'll never forget it. But then I read this book. You must read it today. So you read it? Wasn't it boring? The life of a saint can't be that interesting. Idiot! Stupid idiot. I've been thinking about you. And your salvation. I think you need a kick up the backside. Tell the Galuchons the marriage is off. You don't support it? Think of our situation. I've decided Octave will marry the Lobster. The Lobster? - Is this a joke? - I'm not joking. Octave will marry the Lobster. Hector, this is ridiculous. Have you lost your dignity? Forget about dignity. She sleeps with soldiers. You think you're superior? You're comparing me to a prostitute? Precisely. When she hitches up her skirt and takes 100 sous from a soldier, God is with her and views her sacrifice kindly. Hector, you're stupid. - You're obscene. - Be quiet, frivolous woman! She is closer to God than the daughter of a solicitor. Her poverty will be a passport into heaven. That's what she will bring to this runt. He's your son. My son is a nitwit. My son is a pile of manure, like myself, like his mother. You have no right to talk to me in this way. I agreed Octave could marry a Galuchon, not a trollop! It's the woman he loves. The woman he loves? You love the Lobster, don't you? Well, I... I think... What? Don't you love her? I mean, I... I don't have the experience to say... I'm going to dress and go and ask for her hand. Hector! Why does he say you love the Lobster? Me? The... The Lobster? You're marrying the solicitor's daughter. Yes. But all the same, I don't want... to disobey Father. What? Octave, do you know this girl? Me? How would I know her? - I knit all... - You know her. The spider! Don't move. Come here. There, there. Stop it getting away. There. Don't kill it. I want it alive. I've got it. Give it to me. Scissors. I'll cut off its legs. Why make it suffer? Just kill it. Look. Look. One leg... Don't be so nervous, darling. I'll cut off its head. They're here! Quick. They're here. Go and wash your hands. Where's my shirt stud? Anyone here? Ah, yes. My spider. Spider... You were part of the gang. There you are. What gang? - The one that killed this creature. - What creature? This one! Why are you showing me that? It's sickening. Sickening? You agree with me? I'm sorry I suspected you. Go and get dressed. They're coming. - You're closest to God. - That's right. But you have to accept that you are impure. Excuse me? A miserable earthworm. A poor scorpion. I'll find the killers. They're here. - Your husband... - I know. - Ready? - Yes. The service! Ready? Off we go. - What about Father? - He's gone crazy. We don't need him. Hello. Madam. Madam. Madam. M... Madam. And here are the girls. This is Brigitte, the youngest. Madam. Etiennette. Madam. And Evelyne, the eldest. Madam. My Lord. M... Miss. Please sit down. - What a beautiful château. - It's historic. Did you hear that, girls? Yes, Father. - His Lordship...? - He's had to go into town. There isn't enough time in the days. I myself have an appointment at 5 and must leave before my wife. Let's get straight to the matter. Where is your sister the spider? - Ah, Your Lordship. - Hector, please. Where is your sister the spider? But... I don't know. In the lounge. Lost something? Your sister isn't in the lounge. Where is she? Her Ladyship's sister? She must have escaped. No. Your sister did not escape. You both know it, as you killed her, savagely, after ripping off her limbs. It's one of his jokes. This is ludicrous. No. It's disgusting. I want 3 cobwebs in every room. You are murderers and torturers. Why are you accusing Octave? I killed the spider. - Is that true? - I didn't do anything. That's good, Son. The idea was tormenting me. I thought you unworthy of marrying the one you love. Since you're innocent, I'll ask for her hand. I'm delighted to welcome such a woman into the family. The pleasure is all ours. It's we... The neighbours will say: "You're marrying your son to a whore?" How dare you insult my daughter! Since Mr Octave is marrying me... - Don't they know? - How could they... Your Lordship... I don't have time to chat. Tell them. Some tea? Museau! Come here, boy. Come here. Come here, boy. Come here. Buzard and I became friends straightaway. Get dressed. I knew Buzard already. He was in the 2nd squadron. I even knew his name was Buzard. You're sending me to sleep. Can you hold the end of my belt? I'm not your maid. Getting back to Buzard... I've heard enough of Buzard. Have you got any family? Parents? Sisters? Why would I tell a whore that? They must be very fresh-faced. Give me a cigarette. I've only three left. Charming. - So Buzard... - Get a move on. Don't forget your hat. - Heads. I win. - That's odd. - What's the time? - Have you the time? No. It's about time. I don't believe it! The one time I win! Come on, we'll be confined to barracks! Hurry up! Yes. Miss. Oh, Your Lordship. Nice of you to visit me. Well, come in. Not busy? I'm alone. Your timing is impeccable. Have a seat, my little lamb. Thank you. So, are you looking for a bit of fun? To tell the truth, I have an ulterior motive. My mistake. What a lovely abode you have. Mind if I let some daylight in? At least you don't hurt spiders. Léonie, I may surprise you or even shock you. Shock me? I don't see how you could possibly do that. Do you know my son? Didn't I meet him coming out of your place? Skinny kid, not too bright. So you do know him. My son Octave loves you. No problem. I'll give him a discount. You're just as loyal as I thought. But you misunderstand me. My son loves you and wants to marry you. I don't like being made fun of. It's bound to end badly. Do I look like a man given to jokes? I can't say that you do. He's loved you for years but was too shy to tell you. Me? Poor kid. What rotten luck he has. Not at all. He couldn't do better than to be your husband. What kind of luck can I bring anyone? - I'm busy! - Right, I'll come back. Do that. I wouldn't last a minute cooking dinner or doing the ironing. My dear child... I'd come home smashed and beat up Octave. You're just the wife my son needs. I already love you as a daughter. You do? You love me a little? I love you for your perfection. You like me, then? I'm so in need of affection. You'll have some. My big wolf... My God, forgive me. I was about to give in to an abominable temptation. I'm nothing but a lecherous beast! But I led you on. As I led an innocent creature into the abyss, I was held back by that melodious message. Did you hear it? Yes. That's Risette and Chocolat, my canaries. It was a message from Saint Francis. Scorn me as I deserve. I am a satyr. No, you're not. Look. Even if you'd gone all the way, where's the harm? Don't try to reassure me. Lord, why is your presence not with me always? You're talking like a priest. I held my son's fiancée in my arms. So what? Talking of which... I'd like to see your Octave. - He said "whore". - Marriage is the important thing. You heard the countess: he talks nonsense. - He's overworked. - So am I! Don't forget your 5-o'clock-meeting. Octave, your fiancée awaits! - It's the Lobster. - Octave! - The Lobster! - Octave! The Lobster! Hurry up. Louise, he's crazy! What's that? My dear Louise, when I think you wanted to marry him to a moneybags... Whereas you want to shame him. I'm warning you... My poor wife. As usual, you've completely misunderstood. - Same for you. - Don't touch me. Hector... Hector, you're being reckless. If he does marry this person, who'll feed the family? Will she still entertain soldiers? Your concern is natural, but I've thought of everything. This very evening, the château will be put up for sale. What? With what little money is left, we'll buy a caravan, a horse, and we'll travel the woods and bridleways listening to the chatter of men and the song of the birds. We're not going to live like gypsies. And what will we live on? On handouts, the charity of passing villagers. We'll beg from peasants in the fields. We'll tell them of God and the commandment of love. Come in. Yoo-hoo. It's your little Galuchon come to play. Sundays too, now? What a pity. I said I had a business meeting. How exciting she is! To the bed, right now! You're wasting your time. I'm not in the mood. Yes, I'm wasting my time. You see before you Galuchon, Eugène, solicitor, practising in rue Fantin, appearing in shirt and trousers and without other impediment to see and to touch Miss Lobster, a known streetwalker and a purveyor of delights, trading in ruelle aux Brebis. Miss Lobster is kindly requested, in return for the sum of 15 francs... S... Sorry. I didn't think you were... I told you so. My dear Viscount, your... Close the door. Your presence on these premises is surprising to say the least. - It's because of Father. - Your father? Yes. He's meeting me here. What? Your father? Now I've heard everything. Sir, I must tell you the truth. The woman whom my father wants me to marry... is her. Shocked? Why does your father want you to marry a call girl? What reasons did he give for such a bizarre choice? I didn't really understand them, but I think they were moral and religious. Pardon? Ask him yourself. He'll be here in a minute. Right, I'm off. Don't commit to anything. You'll be hearing from me. Come to my chambers tomorrow. Give me my 15 francs. You're joking! I leave you with a heavy heart full of regret. Same here. So, you're Octave. Good day, ladies. If you knew how often I've stopped outside, counting my money... Sometimes I'd see a soldier going in. I would imagine you... n... naked, moving your body and whispering things. Strange effect it has on kids. And now? I want... I want... to marry you. Too bad about the château, the money and the name! Too bad about all of it! I want to lie beside you for the rest of my life. Well, sonny... Is that what you want? So, will you accept? - I didn't say that. - You sleep with Galuchon! Is that all you have to say? I was expecting a little more. Whispered sweet nothings, maybe a love song... But you went right to... What do you think of my son? I want to marry her as soon as possible! You're not the only one who decides. Léonie? To be honest, he's not what I was expecting. That's clear enough. Do you hear? You're unworthy of Léonie. I thought you had a chance, but I was blinded by paternal pride. Go on, get out of my sight! But I want to marry her! You promised. - I'm not leaving. - Octave, that's enough! I want to be hers, I want her, I want to sleep with her. You lascivious oaf! - Get out! - No. I want to lie with her! I want to lie next to her body. - Out! - No. I want to lie with her! You brat! I want to be hers! This animal is even more repugnant than his father. - Now get lost. - Stop it! Don't be mean to him. He's not exactly my type, it's true. But when he spoke to me of love, I felt a languidness in my breast. Even now, my insides are fluttering. I was flustered before, but if I spoke to you... Save your patter. It's too late now. Affairs of the heart are serious, especially marriage. But I want... I want... It's OK. We can work it out. As from now, we're engaged. We can get to know each other before the wedding. Mr Clérambard, I cannot resist. I saw heaven in Octave's eyes. My dear children. Octave! Come home right now. Come on up, why don't you! - Come home, Octave. - Come on, son. No, Grandmother, I can't. Why not? Father doesn't want me to. What did he say? He said: "Father doesn't want me to." Hector, listen to me... Don't worry, madam. It's not you he's after. Hey, Pastourin! You can see I'm busy. Still? I came earlier. Get lost. Well, really! Forgive us, ladies. My apologies. I'll be back. - Hector! - I'll be back! I'll fight you to the end, do you hear? - Fight me? - I warned you. - We're enemies. - Louise! Come, Mother. Louise! Louise, did you really say we were enemies? I was angry. Angry and upset. You know that, deep down, I love you. But Hector, what's happening? Where are you? Who have you become? It's a miracle, Louise. A miracle? A miracle from heaven. Hector, you've tired yourself out. Come home and rest. On Friday, I strangled the priest's dog. A monk came to our home and gave me a book. - He was Francis of Assisi! - Hector... When the priest got up to leave, he found his dog in the yard, alive. He was barking. He was alive. - The Saint revived him. - Shh! A miracle took place. A miracle! Don't you believe me? Tell me! Hector, we believe everything you say. Do you believe me? I don't want to upset you, but your story's hard to swallow. Just now, I held my son's fiancée in my arms. I held her against me. I was about to fornicate with her. Hector! Fornication, adultery and incest! Hector! When a bird's song rang out. Saved. I was saved! It was him. The poor man, full of love, compassion and brotherliness. The spark of love burst forth! The spark of love! Love! Excellent weather, to boot. Like a log. Are you ready? We leave at 4.30. How did you pay for the caravan? I didn't. I'll have the money tonight. Another miracle, no doubt. Where's Octave? Stop pawing at my thighs! You'll end up bruising them. I'd like to see them. All you think about is bed. Still... It can't be helped. Catch. I'll give you a slap in a minute! - If he could see you... - Who? Saint Francis. Haven't you read the book? Don't laugh. Your father lent me it. I haven't slept. Go and fetch me the pegs from the balcony. It's funny to see him like this. Oh, no! No! What's wrong? No, no! - Let him in, I'll tell him. - No. We're closed! No! No! You've no right! This is private property. Who's he? My fiancé. No, no and no. I won't get in his caravan. I'm not sleeping five to a rabbit hutch. Then move in to my place. What'd we do if we were married? Carry on the business? No. Can you imagine a soldier having it off with Vicountess Clérambard? If you found a soldier in your bed, you'd go to pieces. For us, marriage means the caravan. But do you love me? I'm not used to being proposed to. These things go to my head. Ah, the notaries! Hurry up, that's all I ask of you. Go! Uh-oh. Where are you going? Who are you? - Ladies. - Ah, Sir. The Count is selling his château. These gentlemen are interested. - But wait... - Excuse us. The Count will be here at 4 o'clock to sign the papers. On with the viewing. Go and put on a hat, right now. A miracle? Let's say I give you the money, since the Count wants to sell his château and take to the road. What do we have to do? The money is here. It's yours, on two conditions. First... Get lost, kids. First, your son gives me his word to marry Evelyne. Second... Second... Go away! Second, you must get rid of the Count right now. What do you mean? Do you know Dr Mindeure, the psychiatrist? If you allow your husband his freedom, he'll sell the château, your son will marry a prostitute and the entire family will live in a caravan. Isn't that right? Dr Mindeure is a friend of mine. He'll take care of the Count, and in the meantime I'll get you out of it. If he's committed for a while, it'll be for his own good. It's dreadful, of course. Do you think he's mad? I'm far from convinced. Do you really want to get married? What do you think? Hey! Léonie. What do you think of our caravan? What time are we leaving? In an hour the château will be sold. By tonight we'll be far away. I'll pay for the caravan, I'll give the rest to the poor. But then you'll be poor yourself. That's what we want. I don't! I don't want to beg for handouts. You can keep your caravan. I want to stay in the château. Octave. You've no right to deprive me of it! It's my château. I was born here. It's rightfully mine. I don't want to leave my château! Your château? Your château? Your château? The Château de Clérambard! And you say you're not sure he's mad? Hector... Oh, Louise... How weak I am. Since the Lord has forsaken me, I've returned to violence. Oh, no! What's she doing here? She's going to follow us on the path of the poor. Léonie, give your mother a kiss. No, I just came to see the caravan. Come on. If you're giving her a present, you made the right choice. It's not just for Léonie but for all of us. Come and see. - What for? - There are two bedrooms. Until they're married, you can share with Léonie. I don't think so! She can tell you about Saint Francis of Assisi. I read his book. That St Francis was quite something. Kind, humble... - I'd like to have met him. My dear child... With me he'd have wanted for nothing. I'd have bent over backwards for him. "Coming, darling? It's for the poor." We'd have had a dining room, a bedroom. Drinks at Jules's place every night. - On Fridays... - Octave! Take your hands off her! You should be ashamed. Go away. We're decent people. We want nothing to do with the village hussy! Get lost! What's that you say? On your knees. On your knees before her. With all your airs and graces, you're not fit to carry her train in heaven! Ask for forgiveness. Don't force her, My Lord. We leave in an hour. Let's check the loft for anything we've forgotten. My poor child. Octave! This is your fault. You should've said yes to the Galuchons. Do you hear me, Octave? Where are you going? I'm going to see. I'll think about it. Your Ladyship. What are you doing here? I'm Saint Francis of Assisi. Hector! Hector, listen to me. Have you killed another dog? No. This is the priest's dog. Or else... I don't remember. You seem upset. Sit down. I found the body of the dog I thought had been resurrected. And? I thought I'd strangled the priest's dog, but it was another dog that looked similar. So, contrary to what you thought, there was no miracle. What about the monk? The monk? I saw him, I heard him. It was him. Gustalin. My Lord, I... I disguised myself to scare you. I'd had enough of you chasing my dogs and cats. I wasn't the only one. I never thought it would lead to this. I just wanted... I don't believe you. But it was me! I even cut my hand opening the broken window. Look. The ceiling nearly fell on my head. Remember? How did you get away? There was no one outside. I saw you looking for me. I was scared. I hid in the kitchen for an hour. He escaped when the Lobster was here. And the book? Heaven Publications? My Lord, if you go to the bookshop in town, they're in the window. The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi So it was you? You just avoided a great danger. What danger? When you spoke of a miracle, no one believed you. - So you think I'm mad? - Put yourself in my place. The sale of the château, the wedding, going off in the caravan, the life of a beggar... Who says I've changed my mind? Hector, be logical. There was no miracle. Do I need one to love my fellow man? - Isn't faith enough? - How did you acquire it? It doesn't matter, since I have it! I believe in God! The miracle is that there was no miracle. I can't wait to get away, Louise. Louise, do you think I'm mad? Mad, no, but impossible. I'll bury the unfortunate beast in the forest. You, with me. You, stay here. Oh, the caravan! Your father-in-law's nuts! I've informed the doctor. He'll be here any minute. Where's Mr Octave? Hello. Still as lovely. - Still as cheerful. - Hello, sir. A trip in a caravan! What a poetic idea! You think? Would you like to see the inside? - My God... - Oh, yes. That's easy. It's full up. I'll show you around one by one. - Can we stroke the horse? - Feel free. Coming? He could've shown you first. We're not officially engaged yet. Why don't we simply set the date of the wedding? - The Viscount hasn't committed. - I'll go and get him. No, don't. I'll talk to him man to man. Think he'll kiss you in the caravan? It's possible. As I'm to be his wife, I'll submit. Have you seen the Viscount? Yes. He's showing Brigitte the caravan. Perfect. Sir... Brigitte! Oh, Mother! What's going on? Your son just dishonoured my youngest daughter before my eyes! And you let him? I was too late. Octave... Come out of there. You've betrayed your fiancée. - It's an affront to Léonie. - I couldn't help it. If it had been Evelyne... He chose the prettiest. I'll make it up to you. - How convenient. - There's no choice. - As for the dowry... - What about your fiancée? Hey! There's more than just dead dogs in your loft. Look at this. A waffle iron for feast days, a flask, a blanket for the old nag, a lantern, a harmonica... Léonie, I have terrible news for you. - For me? - Octave has betrayed your love by indulging in wanton sin with that girl. Oh... Well, I never. He's learning. And she is pretty, after all. Keep away! A passing fancy won't change our lives. It will. I have to make amends. For what? Having sinned with her, he must marry her. Really? He sinned with me too, and before her. Did Octave disrespect you? Given how long he'd waited, he had an excuse. All the same, I have priority. That's clear. Well, really! All right. You win. You owe me 100 sous. My money, now. Thank you, sir. Now get lost, you fool. Oh... I don't feel well. - Get her to the château! - She's dead. No, she just fainted. Put yourself in her place. She's breathing. Easy. There's no place for me here. Why? You've every reason to stay. We all need you. That's kind of you. But I've no reason to go away with you. Octave doesn't deserve you. Forget him. If only I could... I can tell you now. I think I loved Octave. You'll say I'm just a whore. Léonie... But I would've been happy to put an end to it. What I'm offering you isn't an end but a beginning. Of course. The angels, the good Lord, the Virgin are all very fine. But I don't really believe in them. Trust me. I'll help you. No, leave that. We leave in a quarter of an hour. Tomorrow you'll be a real good-time girl, and God will recognise you. My little girl, I'm your mother. My baby, it's Mummy here. In addition to the dowry of 1 million... - 1 million? - Allow me to finish. I suggest that you provide Brigitte with a monthly allowance. Let's say 2,000 francs. Am I dreaming? Cigars. I've kept you 2 shelves... Léonie? Léonie! I could've done without this, Doctor. It was reading about Saint Francis of Assisi that did it. No doubt he was touched by grace. It's worrying. Worrying? Grace doesn't always descend via the clergy. Léonie! Léonie! Did you cast her out? Léonie! Hector, where are you going? Hector! Doctor. Father, if you knew what had happened... - Dr Mindeure, meet these ladies. - Doctor. This way, Doctor. He's going to sell! Quickly! - Sell what? - The château. He's mad. Get in. I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Léonie! Come on, please. But where to? And who with? Come. I'm going to see the notary, then the farrier. And then? Then it's straight ahead. Giddy up! I don't believe it! Thank you. The notary's taking care of it. - How much is left? - Barely 1,500 francs. Oh, no, My Lord. You mustn't. Take it. - It's God's will. - No, My Lord... My Lord, I can't! - Take the money, I say. - But I can't. I just can't. - For the love of God! - It's impossible. For the love of God! There. That'll be 4.50 francs. - But I've no more money. - What? Wait. I've got Octave's 100 sous. No. You have nothing. We have nothing. - What about me? - One moment. For the love of God. For the love of God. Thank you. - It was a technical problem. - We're frozen. I don't believe it! Thank you. For the love of God. For the love of God. Oh, my God. My Lord, what are you doing? I'm begging because I'm poor. - I dream of being even poorer. - Where are you taking your family? I'm taking them along roads, through the country, starving, to cry with me: "Come to Jesus, to God." What inspired your mission? The Gospel. The Gospel is nourishment that needs digesting. I won't deprive myself of the Gospel's light. - About the miracles... - I was mistaken. - You don't believe? - Not in that one. But I haven't given up on God granting me another. Thank you. You're presumptuous. And that miracle shall I proclaim up and down the land. And should anyone dare to snigger, be they men, women or priests... I'll personally box their ears. For the love of God. Thank you. Go in peace, Father. You may be stirring up ideas that, while generous, are nonetheless revolutionary. And why not? There is so much injustice. What do you know of injustice? The Lord invested no hope in earthly justice. You're interpreting the Gospel. For the love of God. - Louise, we're leaving. - My Lord... My dear doctor, how are you? Fine, thank you. Yourself? Me? Haven't you heard? I'm mad with hope, mad with love, Doctor. I feel a burning tenderness for every living thing that trembles upon the earth. Having dreamt of the Saint, the madness entered me. I have given myself to Jesus. It's a severe case: regression of the property instinct, confusion of social values, mental perversion. It's very serious. You don't understand, Doctor. Look. Look. Little Saint Francis. Look at him. He's attaching the horse. What's going on? It's contagious: collective hallucination. It's a classic. My God. I can't see anything. The two angels. They're buckling the harness. I wonder what they can see. My glasses. Obviously I've forgotten them! The horse is eating from his hand. How white his hands are... I still can't see anything. I'll tell His Eminence I forgot my glasses. I'm going to get closer. They're returning to heaven. Now everything is clear. Everything is simple. Stand up. Let us bear witness. Please stand. We must leave right away. What about my practice, my servants? - We'll pick them up on the way. - Marvellous! Son-in-law, you are an exquisite creature. We don't have a pass. Don't worry. God will provide. Giddy up! The End One day, he put his house on his back And he left like a clown For his very own moon For his very own heaven Everything's fine in his head He left his money and his past behind But I saw the bird in his hat Here's it's night time Here it's raining Everything's fine in his head Yesterday All the beggars, the children, the people Everyone The madmen, the cats, the dogs, the soldiers Everyone The rich and the poor left their homes And followed him He told them to abandon their villages The land of a thousand and one worries The table was set in the promised land Everything's fine in his head Yesterday All the beggars, the children, the people Everyone The madmen, the cats, the dogs, the soldiers Everyone The rich and the poor Went back to their homes He was never mentioned again He left with his house on his back He left like a clown For his very own moon For his very own heaven It was fine in his head It was fine in his own head
