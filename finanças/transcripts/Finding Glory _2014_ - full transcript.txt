So what do you think? I think she looks good. Um, I did notice a little favoritism on the front left in the beginning, but I think she's just great. I think she'll make a great first horse for my niece. I couldn't agree more. Let's go take a look at the others. Okay. Let's go. This is Callie. She actually won 4th at Nationals last year. Actually, she won second. It may have been second. And she has the most beautiful coat you'll ever see, it's so beautiful. And her spirit is alive... - Yeah, and she's two years old. - Uh-huh. Very strong. Has a great bloodline, and a very bright future. Okay, we'll take her. Great. Okay, and who's this? This is Glory. He is three-and-a-half years old. Um, good looking horse, - but he has some difficulties. - Hey. - He's a little ornery. - Oh, that's all right. - That's not a problem. - But he's so pretty. Yes, honey, he is, but pretty isn't everything. We'll take him. Great. That's just great. Peyton! Wait! It's Glory. Glory. You know, Glory. Lily, we've already been through this. You know, Jordan said that he's not performing, or whatever it is you call it, and he's got a hurt foot. It's a hoof. Horses don't have feet. Look, I gotta get back to the city. I think you need to move on, Lily. Look, I-I gotta go, okay? Sorry. I hope you understand. This is not a reflection of you or Mr. Emerson. We just need to send a message, that's all. I completely understand. And I can assure you, we will take care of this. Yo, Viv. No, I'm still in the office. Yeah, I've been here forever. Like 20 minutes. Yeah, I can't believe I got busted again. What can I say? I like bad boys. Look, I gotta go. I'll call you back. Sebastian, right? Yeah, cut class. And got caught. So what's the damage? - Suspended for a day. - Bummer. Seriously. Look at it this way, next week is fall break so you'll get an extra day of vacay. Yeah, you're right. I mean, it is only a day, so they shouldn't get too mad. Well, she will. Thanks for coming in. Of course. Oh, I heard you're going to Mexico next week. Yes. Cabo. Well, have a good time. Thank you. He said we wouldn't get caught. Girl, that's what they all say. You ready to go, "Mom"? You're just gonna learn everything the hard way, aren't you? You don't know what you're talking about. Really, Sloane? Really? So what did my dad say? I haven't told him yet. I thought I'd let you do the honors. Did you get rid of your Land Rover? - No. - When did you get that? Yesterday. Must be nice having a rich husband, huh? All right, how are we doing? Oh, we're all loaded up and ready to go. Awesome. Fantastic. Everything okay? - Yeah. - Everything's great, Jordan. - I think we're good to go... Oh. - Sorry about this. Who've we got here? Oh, I think we forgot one. Calvin, why don't you open up that trailer and let's get this horse loaded up? Jordan, I'm sorry, the trailer's full. Whoops. You know what? It's not a problem. Uh, I'll have Otis load him up in our other trailer, and we'll bring him to you tomorrow. Good deal. Well, that might be difficult, Jordan. Uh, the double's broken. Well, that's not a problem. We'll just load him up in the Cherokee trailer. Cherokee's in New Mexico. Won't be back for a few days. Um... Would it be okay if I brought him to you on Monday? Oh, Monday, actually not. We have a big horse show to go to, and we'll be gone for about two weeks. - Oh. - But it's not a problem. I'll just come back and get him when we get back. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Okay. Thank you. - All right. - Appreciate it. - Just take good care of him. - Okay. - Got it? While we're gone. - Will do. - Thank you. - Bye-bye. Come with me. This is just ridiculous. Like truly unbelievable. I'm so embarrassed. I cannot believe that happened. Put the horse in the stall. Say, Jordan, are you sure you wanna do this? - Do what? - Sell this horse. I think he's a keeper. Poor old Glory's never had a fair chance. Well, that's a nice sentiment, and I'm sure he appreciates it. The horse is sold. What about Lily? Is Lily on board with this decision? You listen to me, Otis Walker. I run this ranch. Me, and only me. And if you don't like that or you're not happy with that, you know where the front gate is. You understand? Yeah? You do? Yeah. Put the horse in the stall. Yes, ma'am. Go finish baling that hay. Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetpea. What's going on? What are you doing? I'm just looking over the information that the travel agent sent over in the itinerary. Oh. We wish you were going with us. We? Sloane, don't start. Peyton wasn't the one who didn't renew her passport. Viv said I don't need a passport to go to Mexico, just a driver's license. Viv is wrong. You do need a passport. You haven't even gone to go get your driver's license yet. You only have a learner's permit, and that's not the same thing. Well, Viv said it was. You need to quit listening to people. Start thinking for yourself, Sloane. A big concern is that you're gonna be here all alone. I'll have Olivia. Sloane, what's going on? Have you talked to Peyton yet? What is it now? Well, you don't need to get mad, Dad. I'm not mad. What happened? I need to tell you something. Uh... I kinda got in trouble at school today. What kind of trouble? I, uh... I cut class and got caught. You skipped class? Yes, but it was just this once, and it was only one class. And, well, Viv needed me to take her home, so... I promise I won't do it again. I promise. I suppose skipping one class isn't gonna jeopardize your academic career or anything. So you're not mad? I'm not exactly happy about it, but no, I'm not mad. Thanks, Daddy. I skipped a few classes in my day. Detention, not a big deal. Sloane? I got suspended. Now I'm mad. - Hey. - Hey. Do you, uh... Do you know anything about Sloane being suspended from school today? I'm the one that picked her up. And you don't think that's anything important enough to tell me? No. I thought Sloane should tell you herself. And apparently she has. I... I just wish there was some way that you two could come together or something. I'm sorry, Mitch, I just... I-I don't have much in common with a spoiled high school girl with an attitude. Hey! She's been through a lot, Peyton. It's-it's not fair. It's a tough transition for her. You're not gonna tell me that you wanna cancel the trip now, are you? No. No, we're going. And we're gonna have a great time. I promise. Okay. But, you know, you really need to start setting some boundaries for her. I know, I know. You're right. Again. Yes? Your father and I are going to dinner. Would you like to join us? I thought I had to stay in my room until my father decides my punishment. Everyone has to eat. I guess so. You guess so? Okay, I'll go. We'll be downstairs when you're ready. I'm ready now. You can't wear that. - Why? - Are you kidding? We're going to the country club. That looks awful. Change. We'll be downstairs. I'm not changing. Then enjoy a nice, quiet evening alone. I'll try. Toodles, Pey-Pey. And, Sloane, no boys here tonight. You know, my dad bought this house way before you had your hooks into him. I'm serious. No boys. Thank you. What do you mean, you can't come? I can't, not tonight. Are you kidding me? Look, Gabe's got the keys to his uncle's restaurant, and we're meeting him and Viv there. - So, come on. - Restaurant? I don't know, Seb. I already had dinner and I don't really need to eat anymore. We're not going there to eat. We're going there to drink. I mean, have you seen the bar in this place? It's awesome. - Drink? - Mm-hmm. I don't know. Sebastian, it's a weeknight, and I told you, my parents aren't home. So, Peyton's your parent now? No. I mean, my dad's not home. Perfect. So, let's go. I can't, not tonight. Really. Okay, look, Sloane. - Do you wanna be with me? - Yeah. Well, I mean, of course, yes. 'Cause I don't need this. I would have no problem finding someone else to go with me. Don't be a jerk, Seb! I got in trouble today. I got in trouble because I went to hang out with you instead of going to school. Aw, did you get in big trouble? It's not funny. I got suspended. Oh, for one day. Big deal. Okay.... I know you got in trouble because of me, and I'm sorry. But, that's why I wanna go out tonight. You know, have a little fun. You know, make it up to you. My dad got really mad. Oh, yeah, he got so mad. So mad, in fact, he took your evil stepmom out to dinner. Let me ask you a question, though. Did he even bother to invite you? Well, no. Not really. Yeah, you stay here and we're gonna go out and have fun. See, they don't care if you're happy or not. I do. Really? Come on, let's go. Sorry to interrupt your night and have you come down here, Mr. Emerson. No, no, I really appreciate you handling it in this manner. Well, under normal circumstances we would've taken them down to the station, but because the restaurant is owned by a relative of Gabriel Taylor, we felt we could contact the parents directly. So they were just hanging out here at the Taylors' restaurant? Actually, the suspects were already headed out when they were apprehended. I-I'm sorry, suspects? Apprehended? Are you serious? We received the call from the alarm company about a break-in at this location. When we arrived, we observed the suspects attempting to leave the restaurant with several items. Apparently, they were having trouble setting the alarm - and thus the call. - What items? - Alcohol, Mr. Emerson. - I see. Thank you, Officer. You bet. I thought you guys were leaving this afternoon. We are. Well, you're up early. I have things to do. I guess it's okay. You guess what is okay? My suitcase. I mean, you didn't ask, but I guess it's okay if you use it. I have my own luggage, Sloane, thank you. Dad, why is my suitcase out? No way! You made it so I get to go with you to Mexico? Thanks, Daddy. Um, not exactly. You need a passport to go to Mexico, Sloane. Sorry. Where's Olivia? We gave her two weeks vacation. Dad, what's going on? Wait... You're not sending me to Grandma's house, are you? - Because I... - No. We're not sending you to Grandma's, but you're not staying here either. Well, I don't wanna go anywhere. That's too bad. In light of everything that's been going on over the last few weeks, we thought it best that you do not stay here. We? I see. So she's making you do this. - Unbelievable. - That's enough, young lady. That decision was mine alone. Peyton was nice enough to make last minute arrangements so you could stay at her family's place out in the country. Why can't I stay here? Sloane! I'll be in our room. I'm not staying in some trailer. You must be Sloane. - The one and only. - So I hear. So, I'm Lily, and this is my daughter Sophie. Sophie wants to be a rapper. Yo, what up? So are you hungry? Do you want a drink or something? - No, I'm fine. - Peyton says you're gonna be staying here for the next week or so? Yeah. I can't believe you're Peyton's sister. Yep. So is this your house? Yeah, mine and Sophie's. And you're more than welcome to stay here as long as you like. In fact, do you wanna see the rest of the place? Sophie, you wanna show her around? There's more? You dig horses, yo? - I guess. - Sweet. Just let me change and I'll be right back, we'll go, okay? So have you spent much time out in the country? Not really. I mean, we would visit, but that's about it. Yeah? Well, what do you think so far? It's definitely different. Yeah, I really like it out here. It's calm and peaceful, and we've got all the horses. So I want you to feel really at home here, okay? You're welcome to explore, look around. So right over here, we have our stables where we keep the family horses. And if you go down this road, you'll find the arena, and we used to use it for cutting, but now it's just mostly for practicing with the show horses. And so right here is the main stables. And we also do our business here. What's the business? Breeding. Buying and selling horses. And, of course, showing. Come on. I wanna go play with the horses. Okay, go. - Hey. - Hey. What can I do for you, Lily? I just wanted to come by and introduce you Peyton's daughter, Sloane. She's gonna be staying with us for a little while. Stepdaughter. I mean, I'm not Peyton's actual daughter. She's just my stepmom. Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. So, have you ever worked on a ranch before? Okay, come on now, Jordan. She's our guest. Well, I'm just thinking, if she's gonna be around for a while, she might wanna help out. So, Jordan, what exactly do you do around here? Jordan's our ranch manager. She's in charge of most of the business around here. Yeah, actually, I do all of it. Speaking of which, uh, I have so much to do. It was so lovely to meet you, Sloane. Come on, I'll show you the horses. It's beautiful, huh? Yeah, I mean, it's not Dallas, but... Um, hold on, I'll be right back. I have to take this. Hello? He's beautiful, isn't he? Sloane? Come here, I want you to meet someone. This is Dylan. Nice to meet you. Thank you, Lily. I mean, it's nice to meet you. So, Dylan works on the ranch a couple days a week. And when he's not here, he's a Kangaroo. I-I go to Weatherford High and, uh, our mascot's a kangaroo. So where do you go to school now? Oh, I, uh, I go to Highland Prep in Dallas. Well, it was nice to meet you, and I should probably get going. Well, um, you know what? Maybe, uh... maybe Dylan could take you riding sometime. Yeah, we've got lots of trails. That'd be cool. All right, see ya. Viv, where are you? Are you sure about Sebastian? I mean, Ivy Wilson, are you serious? Just call me, like, as soon as possible. Huh. Go on ahead. He won't bite. At least not bad enough to give you stitches or anything. I'm just kidding. Here, give him this. He also likes to be scratched between the eyes. I'm Sloane. - Peyton's daughter? - Stepdaughter. Name's Otis. I also answer to "Hey, you!" Who's this? This is Glory. He's beautiful. And I love the white stripe between his eyes. Well, I wouldn't get too attached to him. Why? Glory's on his way out. Sold, last week. He should've been gone already, but as it turns out, there wasn't any room for him. They'll be back in a few weeks, pick him up then. I can see why somebody would wanna buy him. Can I ride him? - No. - No? That's actually why they sold him. He's ornery. Nobody can ride him. But you can train him, right? Not enough time. Can't ride, can't show. Can't show, you gotta go. But if you had time, then you could train him, right? - And then maybe. - Maybe. Who can I talk to about training him? Well, that would be Jordan, but I'm not sure you wanna talk to her about this. Why? Because Jordan's the one who sold him. You change your mind? - About what? - About helping out, doing some work. Sloane was just asking about Glory. She was? Yeah, I saw him yesterday out in the corral. Oh, yeah. That horse has been sold. Sorry. It was Lily's horse. Otis, did you bale that hay in the back pasture like I asked you to yesterday? Nice meeting you, Sloane. That horse didn't get ridden for a reason. He's ornery and nobody can ride him? Yeah, Otis told me. He also said that all he needs is somebody to work with him. Oh, he did? He sure did. Sloane, walk with me. And this is where everybody starts. Who? Everyone who works here starts by cleaning the stalls. Why? Because you start at the bottom, pay your dues. Did you do this job? I was cleaning stalls by the time I was nine. So, like, 20 years ago. Look, I don't mind you hanging around down here, but if you're gonna be in the stables or interacting with any of the horses, you need to check in with me first. Look, Lily told me the only thing she expects from me is to be home by dark and tell her where I am. Other than that, I can do whatever I want. Lily doesn't run this ranch. I do. So you need to start doing what I say, young lady, because what I say goes. Lily just owns it. Seb, come on. We're not supposed to be out here. Hey, you own the place, so, uh, why can't we be out here? I know, but they have working hours and the horses need to sleep. Horses don't sleep, babe. Seb, I'm serious. Okay, look, this place is lame and there is nothing to do. Didn't you come all the way out here to see me? Yeah, I did. So, hey, I got an idea. Let's say that you and I go back to that little guest house you've been staying in. Huh? I can't. I just got here. - It's too soon. - Okay. Well, there's a party in Dallas that I know about, - so we can go there. - I can't. I told you, Sebastian, I can't leave the ranch. But the whole time, though? Come on, I wanna show you something. No, come here first. What? I don't know. You don't know what? I don't know if I wanna be kissing somebody that's been kissing Ivy Wilson. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? I haven't seen Ivy in, like, over a year. Oh, really? Because Blake Armstrong told Viv that she saw you and Ivy two nights ago at Nick's house, together. Okay, okay. I guess I saw her the other night, okay? Oh, really, Seb? You "guess" you saw her the other night? What happened to "I haven't seen her in over a year"? Sloane. Sloane, Sloane, Sloane, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You can't leave me out here. Okay. You know what? I-I saw her the other night, okay? - So what's the big deal? - The big deal, Sebastian, is that Blake said she saw you kissing her! So you're a liar! Breathe in. And then open. Hey, there. Sleeping in? Yeah, that bed is just so comfy. Mm-hmm. So, yoga, huh? Yes, ma'am. Every morning, every night. It gets the blood pumping, brings the air into the lungs. You should join us. I'm not really the yoga type. Oh, come on now, everybody's the yoga type. Young, old. Change your life. It's dope, yo. Well, maybe next time. I was just gonna head out to the stables if that's okay with you. Yes, ma'am, whatever you want. Oh, Lily? Yeah? Do you think it'd be okay if I went riding? Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Well, what horse can I ride? Any of them. Maybe you could get Dylan to take you for a ride. You think so? He's so cute. He'd be like my own personal cowboy. Dylan. Yeah, the guy you introduced me to yesterday, Dylan. He's right behind me, isn't he? Morning, ladies. Morning. So Jordan wanted me to come by and ask Sloane one more time if she wanted to help out on the ranch. What, you mean work? I guess, that's... that's how she made it sound. No, no, I thought we discussed this. She did not come out here to spend a week working on a ranch. She's here to-to find inner peace, to experience herself, not work. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna call Jordan. - I'm gonna get this squared away. - No, no. No, Lily, it-it's okay. I think it'd be good for me to work. You know, roll up my sleeves and get my fingernails dirty. Are you sure? Yes. Come on, Dylan. I'd rather do yoga. - You know what I'm saying? - I do. Get it tight. All right. So what's next, cowgirl? Huh? Keep that left shoulder back. Get that heel down, come on. There you go. All right, all right, come on back. Better than the last time. Let me take the horse back to the stable. All right, I'll meet you over at the stall, okay? So, how's your first day on the job, ranch hand? Gonna sleep great tonight. I thought it was cool you decided to, you know, come out here and help. I decided since I'm staying here, I might as well contribute. Though I'd rather do something else besides clean stalls. Yeah, Jordan does that to everyone who comes to this place. She'll lighten up in a few days. - Doubt it. - Yeah, you're probably right. So, uh, what were you doing here? Oh, showing Sara how to cut and show her maybe a little bit of everything. I saw you and Sara the other day by the gate. Someone special? Yeah, she is. She's one of the most important people in my life. Oh. She's my sister. Oh, your sister. Yeah, she's-she's pretty cool. - So-so what about you? - Me? Yeah, was that... was that your boyfriend I saw yesterday? When I was leaving I saw some guy drive up, and I assumed he was looking for you. Yeah, that's Sebastian. - His name's Sebastian? - Yeah. - What? - Nothing. Hey, uh, I gotta get back. So you tell Sebastian I said hey, okay? Sure thing. One more thing, Sloane, um... Be careful about all that. All what? Having friends over, and... You know, you know how Jordan is, and even Lily can get spooked. They don't like accidents around here, believe me. So just be careful, okay? All right, see you around. You know what, I can't believe that you are letting them make you work in a barn. Seriously? It's horse stables. And they're not making me. Like, what exactly are you doing? Shoveling dirt, and hay, and you know what. Just kind of whatever needs to be done, you know? That's so rough. Sorry, Sloane, but that's kinda gross. No, no, that's kinda hot. - Gabe! - Ow. Hey, watch it, bro. I'm just saying. It's gonna sound crazy, but... kinda made me feel kind of good, you know? It made you tired is what it did. Yeah, I can't even keep my eyes open. Yeah, you know what? Tired and lame. No. I can't. I have work in the morning. Don't look at me boys, I'm driving. Hello? Well, we gotta find something fun to do. I got an idea. - What? - What? Just follow me, okay? So these are the stalls that my girlfriend cleans out. Seb, you know we're not supposed to be in here. We're not supposed to be in here, huh? Well, you spent all day cleaning these things out and we can't even take a look, - that's ridiculous. - Whoa, whoa. Check out this stallion. Hey, Sloane, uh, did you clean this stall out? Yeah, probably. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, I got an idea. Let's ride the horse. Yeah. No, Seb, come on, let's go. Yeah, we really need to go. No, no, we're not going anywhere. If you work in here all day I think you've earned the right to ride the horse. Come on, Gabe. Get the gate, we're gonna ride it. No, I really don't think you are. And who are you? Dylan, I'm sorry, we... Ah... Oh, so you know this guy? Sebastian, let's go now. No, we're not going anywhere. Listen here, cowpoke, my little worker girlfriend has been cleaning out these stalls all day, and we're gonna ride this filly. Got it? Well, first off, it's not a filly, stupid. And second, I know Sloane's been cleaning out all these stalls because I'm the one that shows her how. What did you call me, you hick? Well, now you did it, genius. What is that? It's an alarm, signals the police, which they should be here in, uh, about ten minutes max? Are-are the police really coming? No, it just notifies the alarm company. The police won't come unless we tell them to. I'm so sorry. The alarm company does call Jordan, though. I am in so much trouble. Just go. I got this. Glory... What are you doing here? Breakfast, Sloane? Oh, no, thanks. Not today. Well, at least get a piece of fruit. It's the most important meal of the day. What happened to Sophie, the rapper? That was so last week. So what is it this week? I'm a Rhodes scholar. See ya. Oh, Sloane, your dad called last night. - Really? - Mm-hmm. What did he say? Not much, just, um... Well, the resort's really beautiful, and he and Peyton are having a great time, and um... and they miss you, of course. I think he was just checking in. Well, I'm sorry I missed the call. Well, it was late, I didn't wanna wake you up. Lily, what's the name of the horse with the white stripe between his eyes? Was his name Glory? Yeah. How'd you know that? Otis told me. We had to sell him. Gotta go. Hey, Sloane! Hey. - Got you a reprieve. - A reprieve? After you're finished with this one, old Dylan here's gonna show you something new. So is Jordan giving me a break? Not exactly. You've been cleaning the stalls out so quickly, she had to find something else for you to do. You kids have fun. Hey, forget about this. Let's go. So, uh, this is how you feed a horse then, huh? He's grazing. Horses love it. So, did you get in trouble last night? Not really. She got mad, but what's new? Where did you go? I came up to the house, but you weren't there. Did you sneak back out with Sebastian? You came back up to the house? Yeah. Threw a couple rocks at your window. Are you familiar with a horse named Glory? Yeah. Well, why would Lily sell such a pretty horse? Pretty has got nothing to do with it. Glory got ornery, so Jordan pulled the trigger, so to speak. That horse wouldn't hurt a flea. That's 'cause you never tried to ride him. Bet you I could. You ever ridden a horse? Are you kidding? Tons of times. I'm rich, remember? My advice is just stay away from that barn, and stay away from Glory. You know that Lily thinks the horse is already gone, right? It'll be gone soon enough. That's another thing I would stay away from. - What's that? - Jordan and Lily. Glory! Hey. Hey. I'm gonna get you some exercise, okay? Just make sure all that stuff is restocked. You boys know what to do. Okay? Just don't... What on earth do you think you're doing? I just figured Glory could use some exercise. Oh, did you? You were supposed to go through me if you were gonna deal with any of the animals or go into the stables. Well, I thought this was Lily's horse. It doesn't matter that it's Lily's horse. I was very clear. You understood me. This is a working ranch. I am telling you things for your own safety. Hey, Jordan, his leg is completely healed. I don't care about his back leg. Would you put him in his stall and make sure that no one else messes with him? I'll be right there. Do not touch this horse again. Do you hear me? I'm gonna talk with you later, do you understand? Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. - Buddy. - So what happened to his leg? He kicked the gate. Well, would walking help? He doesn't need to walk. He needs to run. What do you need, a chair? I would've given anything to see the look on Jordan's face when she saw you with Glory. Yeah, she seemed pretty mad. But, I don't understand. What's wrong with letting the horse walk? You know, get some exercise. Okay, that's not it. When Jordan gives an order, she just... She's used to seeing people do what she wants. See, I don't understand that either. Jordan doesn't own this ranch. Lily does. What? I-I'm not sure exactly. I mean, I've only heard this and that, but, you know, I don't know if Lily actually owns this ranch, technically. But, I mean, whoever owns this place bought it from Jordan's family. You're kidding. No. I mean, Jordan grew up here. And I guess when the economy sank, they sold it. Or she sold it. You know, I don't know. But I do know that Jordan doesn't own this place anymore. So then why is it Jordan's decision to sell Glory? I mean, she runs this ranch. I mean, she buys and sells horses all the time. In fact, she's going to a horse auction tomorrow in Waco. So... what happens to Glory when he leaves? Glue factory, I guess. What? Are you serious? Okay, Mr. Glory. Come with me. Come on. Okay, Glory. It's gonna be no big deal. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just gonna get on you. Whoa. Okay. All right, good boy. We're just gonna walk. Okay, yeah. You got it, all right? Let's walk. All right. There you go. That's a good boy, Glory. We're walking. I love you, Glory. Here, let me see it. - Ow! - Oh, poor baby. - No, it's fine, it's fine. - No, no! - Hey, it's fine, it's fine. - No! - What happened? - Nothing. I just slammed my hand into the door on my way here. Must have been in a hurry. Something like that. So how'd you find this spot? You know, I don't actually remember, but I come here as much as I can. - It's so peaceful. - Yeah. I don't remember the last time I felt like this. What? So you really rode Glory, huh? Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't know about ride, but... I walked him. Still, that's amazing. I don't want him to go to some glue factory. What? Why are you laughing? I'm serious. Well, when I told you that, I... I mean, I don't think there's an actual glue factory that they take horses to or anything. Well, I thought so. Well... You're so mean. Hey, I didn't think you would believe it. Well, I did. You're such a loser. So what really does happen? Best case scenario is he gets moved from place to place. What's the worst case? I don't want that for Glory either. I just want him to stay here. Me too. We've just gotta find a way to save Glory, you know? I'm not answering. Dylan! Why do you date that guy? - Well, you don't know him. - Yes, I do. And I know plenty of other guys that are just like him. He's... he's using you, Sloane. - Using me? - Yes. For what, money? His family has more than mine. Look, he can date any girl he wants and he chose me. - I gotta go. - Sloane. I think you're an amazing girl. Well, I'm glad you think so. I just want you to think so. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. Wait, before I forget, your dad called again. What? You don't seem very happy about that. I know Peyton can be difficult. All right, let's be honest, she can be a real pain in the butt sometimes. And that face she makes when she's... Ugh, it's so annoying. I've seen it a dozen times. But deep down, she's a really good person. And she has your best interest at heart. Anyway, your dad's gonna try back later. Do you remember the other day when I was asking you about Glory? I do. Well, I was wondering if... I was wondering if I could work with him. Otis said all he needs to do is run, so... Honey, Glory is gone. So I was exploring the other night, and I found Glory in here. Exploring, huh? Oh, Glory. Ah, Glory. I got Glory about a year and a half ago at an auction, and he had really good bloodlines. He wasn't a prize winner or anything. But as you can see, there was just something special about him. Anyway, I wanted him, so I got him, thinking that if we worked with him, maybe we could show him. And Otis liked him, too. - So what happened? - Nothing. Just, um, he didn't make it, I guess. So why don't you just keep Glory as your own personal horse? Well, I wanted to, but I guess I lost that battle. I don't know. Honestly, it's just that, um, Glory bucked the last person off of him about eight months ago, and no one's been able to mount him since. Look, there's gotta be some reason why he hasn't been taken yet. So I'll find out, and I'll make sure he's moved back to the other stables, but, he's been sold, Sloane. I'm sorry. All right, well, I'm gonna head back. Okay. Hey, sweet boy. Sloane! Why haven't you been returning my calls? - Quiet, they'll hear you. - So? I don't care. And that's the problem. What are you talking about? Of course I care, I called you six times, and you haven't returned one of my calls. You were a jerk the other night, when you took off. Well, you wanna know why? 'Cause the stable boy called the cops on us. He didn't call the cops on you! You and Gabe set off the alarm, ran off and then left me all alone. Dylan was the only one who stayed to help me. Dylan? He stayed with you, did he? - It wasn't like that. - Well, then what was it like? Sloane. Unbelievable. Hey, do you just follow her around for fun? Whatever, dude. Lily wanted me to come by before I left to check up on you. Everything all right? Sebastian, I think it's time for you to go now. How does he know my name? - Now. - I'm talking to my girlfriend. - Sebastian. - I think you're done. Dylan. Come here. What? What? Look, I do care about you, Sloane. I called you six times, and I didn't call you the next day 'cause I wanted you to call me, okay? All right, look, look, look. I should've called you that night. I know that, I'm sorry. But you wanna know what? There are a lot of girls that wanna be with me. Then why don't you go be with one of them? Man... Sorry about that. Wanna watch a movie? - Jordan. Jordan, stop! - No, I really don't have time for this. No, I'm not done talking to you. No, I asked you to move him, and you haven't done it, and I find him in that old barn. What is this? I can't move him right now. He's been quarantined because he's been sold. Quarantine is one thing, but storing him down at the other end of the ranch is a whole other thing. Where else do you want us to quarantine? Just listen to me for one minute. Listen, I understand the protocol. I just want my horse moved back to the main stables until they come and pick him up. It's not your horse anymore. Jordan, can I show you something? Okay, Otis, be ready in case he bucks. It would serve that brat right to get bucked off. No one was supposed to go near that horse. Come on, Glory. There you go. See, Jordan? He's fine. He's not ornery. See what? That you didn't get bucked off that time? It doesn't matter, the horse has been sold. Jordan, it's because we thought he was unmanageable, but if he's not, then we could train him and keep him. That's great. I'll tell Charlotte. She can walk him around in a little circle. Jordan! Lily owns this ranch, and I think she should have a say if he goes or not. You're right. Her family does own this property. And when Peyton bought this ranch from my family six years ago, the arrangement was that I would run the ranch. For how long? 'Til I decide not to. The horse goes. I'm sorry. Mm... I'm sorry, Sloane. I thought it was awesome, you being able to ride Glory. I swear, no one, no one has ever been able to ride this horse. Yeah, well, it doesn't matter. He's sold. There's nothing we can do about it. I was thinking. Jordan said that her family sold this farm to your mom, right? She's not my mom. - I know, but... - Dylan. I'm gonna head back. Could you stay and make sure he has enough food and water? Sure. Hey. No, I've been asleep. Wait... what? She's coming to pick him up in the morning? Are-are you sure? No, okay. I'll be there in a minute. No, Dylan, I need you to do something for me. Are you sure about this, Sloane? I mean, where are you going to go? - Let me go with you. - No. You have to stay here. At least tell me where you're going. I'm going that way. What? I can't tell you where I'm going. Why not? I'm not going to tell anyone, I swear. I know you won't, but if you don't know where I am, then you won't have to lie. Sloane... I'm proud of you. Come on, Glory. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm good, thanks, how are you? - How was your trip? - It was great, thanks. - But you had to cut it short? - I did. My husband's still up there, but we have a buyer coming down from Montana that I'm meeting with. - Oh. - So here I am. Good, good. Well, I'll have Otis bring your horse. Great. Can't wait to see him. Otis. Otis! Yes, ma'am. Can you bring this nice lady's horse around? - Be right there. - It should just be a minute. - Great, thank you. - Mm-hmm. - How is he? - He's great. So it was beautiful up there? Oh, my gosh, there you are. Come on, boy. What do you mean, the horse is gone? I mean he's gone, he's not in his stall. Well, where is it? I don't know, when you called me on the radio, I figured he was already loaded up. Who was the first one in today? Dylan, I think. Okay. There we go. All right, come on. Come on. Yes, Glory. So you didn't notice the horse was missing? No. Well, yes, uh, I did notice the horse wasn't there, but the stable was open when I got here. And you had told me that they were picking him up first thing, so I thought they already came by. And, plus, the alarm didn't go off last night. She's not at the house. Dylan, you said the alarm didn't go off last night? Yes, ma'am. How would you know? Come on. All right, well, it's not The Ritz, but it'll do. Should one of us go wait by the house? No, when she comes back, she's gonna have to pass through here. We don't wanna miss her. You're not gonna call the police, are you? No. I thought you said you weren't gonna call the police. No, I'm not. It's gonna be much worse than the police. Hola. Um, sí. Room 236, por favor? Mitch Emerson. Gracias. There you go. There. Yeah, I'm sure that feels better, huh? Yeah. Are you hungry? Here. I only have one carrot left. Guess I'm not so good at this horse saving thing, am I? All right, so she-she left here yesterday with, uh... It was actually day before yesterday, at night. Day before yesterday at night. So what is that, 36, 37 hours ago? She left 36 hours ago on a horse. On a horse? Really? She became attached to a certain horse. She was working in the stables and took a liking to a horse named Glory. Wait, I-I thought you sold him. Oh, I did, but when they came to pick him up, he wasn't here. Taken who knows where by that little brat who needs some discipline. Jordan, wait, wait. You said that the horse was dangerous or something, and that-that no one could ride him. - No one was supposed to. - Hold on there. Now you're telling me that the horse my daughter supposedly stole and rode off on is now dangerous and unrideable? Has anyone called the police? Anyone? No. Well, we've gotta call the police now. I'll call. I'll call them. I do not understand you, Lily. Why didn't you call the police? Sloane could be laying in a ditch somewhere with a broken leg or worse. She's not in a ditch somewhere with a broken leg. She's just fine. Look at me. She has a deep connection with this horse and he's not dangerous. I've seen them together, he's very gentle. And she didn't take him to be defiant. She's trying to save him. That's why I didn't call the police. And they're gonna be back anytime now. I hope you're right. Okay, Glory, we can go back now. We-we gotta show them. We have to prove to them that you're worth keeping. All right, everybody. Thanks for coming out here and helping. As you know, Sloane has been missing for about 36 hours. We've called the police. There's only so much they can do, so I figured we can help out. If we break off in groups of three, we can cover a lot more area. So if you three cover the south end of the ranch, you three cover the north end of the ranch. Dad... - What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? Well, I thought that you and Peyton... Do you have any idea how worried we've been? We've been scared half to death. What were you thinking, Sloane? You don't understand, I rode Glory. Nobody's ever been able to ride Glory and I did. What does that have to do with anything? - Well, you don't understand. - No, you don't understand. It's all about you. In all these instances, it's always about you, Sloane. You never think about anyone but yourself. It's all about you, Sloane. It always has been, and it always will be. No, Dad, it's different this time. I'm out. Goodbye, Glory. Can I come in? I wanna talk to you. Look, Dad... I'm sorry. For everything. I'm so sorry. Out of everyone, I did not wanna disappoint you. I've been thinking. I wanna apologize to you, Sloane. I should have done things better. Lots of things. When your mom... It was tough on you, and it was tough on me, too. The years went by and we got through it, together. And I couldn't have done it without you. I just want you to be happy, Dad. And I am. But I want you to know that I love you more than anything else in this world. And I always will. I love you too, Dad. Now come with me. Come on. Daddy, why are we coming down to the arena? Just follow me, okay? All right? I'm-I'm blown away. Peyton agreed to give Glory one last chance. And I thought Sara would give her a good show. I had a long talk with Lily, and she told me all about how you've been working with Glory. I think it showed a lot of character, Sloane. And she and this young man here convinced me to give Glory another shot. But I thought he was sold. Don't worry about that. I'll handle it. So he gets to stay? Yes. So are you gonna show him? I don't know. That's up to you. Me? He's your horse now. Lily insisted. But what about Jordan? Jordan doesn't work here anymore. She decided it was time to move on, so... Why don't you go say hello to your new horse? We did it. And you were right, it was you and me. Come on, Glory. Thought I might find you out here. Yeah, I was taking Glory from the back pasture and I had to stop here. So this is your spot now, huh? It's our spot. Come on. Guess it's off to the big city, huh? - Yeah, but I'll be back. - Promise? You're gonna take good care of my boy here, right? Of course. Wasn't talking to you.
