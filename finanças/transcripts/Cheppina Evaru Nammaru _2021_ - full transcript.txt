What’s wrong with you? Why are you acting like a beggar? Don’t be so cheap. Why are you turning out this way? Buddy, I achieved a lot in my life. So much so that I don’t have a place for them in my memories. What exactly happened? Why are you feeling worried? We believe that you are the happiest amongst us all. Why would you talk as if you suffer a worse fate than us? Idiot! Cut it. First, have your beer. Then, we can talk. What would you like, sir? One beer. Okay, sir. Hold on. 90ml each of rum, whiskey, wine, gin and vodka. Okay, sir. Hold on. Mansion House brand must be present in that. Okay, sir. Sir, your car is here. Damn it! What fate?! These early morning shifts... (Traffic noises) You are so lucky. What’s wrong with that guy?! I apologize for what happened this morning in the bathroom. What kind of an apology is that? How disgusting of you to use a ladies’ washroom? What can I do? When I work up in the morning, I had just gotten my salary. I was quite high too. The gents’ toilet was completely occupied... and I badly needed to pee. That is why I needed to use the ladies’ toilet. Well, the thing is...you are quite lucky. Do you know that? Well, the thing is... you are crossing your limits. Yeah, I was getting there... Why did you not complain when I kissed you in the washroom? Doesn’t that mean, you like me a little bit somewhere? Tell me. If that’s the case, we can date. That’s not the case. I know that you are a good guy so I let the matter rest. Do you drink? What’s wrong with you? Who drinks this early in the morning in the office? Okay, let that go. Anyways, are you in love with me? I’ve been asking you out for three months. Well, I don’t know why but whenever I talk to you, I feel quite happy. You sit beside me and drink alcohol. You are always late to work. And you use ladies’ toilet. How can I be in love with you? Ananya... you know all about me and yet, you don’t know what’s in my heart. Of course, I do. Perhaps that’s the reason why despite your shenanigans, I am quiet. All right. I’ll keep a watch on how much longer you can stay this way. Okay, bye then. See you later. Jerk! Sir, there are errors in the program. No matter how much I try, I am unable to resolve them. Everyone recommends that I take your help. Please, take a look at it. Come here and sit down. Thank you, sir. Are you always about work? Why don’t we talk something less formal? I heard that you were in love with a girl from Pune. What happened there? Nothing of that sort, sir. It’s not working out for us. Yeah, how can it work out? You have had such success with Ananya madam. How did you win her? It doesn’t happen on its own. You have to work at it. For the girls of this generation, you can’t get away with chocolates, biscuits or cute talk. You must be straightforward and ask them out for a drink. Of course, they would say no. For the next few times, be polite and keep requesting them. That is when they would open up and tell you that they don’t frequent the pubs but have a drink or two occasionally at parties. That is when you guys will be in sync. Sir, how do you know all this? How long has it been since you got here? I’ve been here a while. Get back to work. Sir, it is resolved? -Yes, it is done. Sir, we’ve been trying to resolve this for the past three days. You solved this in a matter of minutes. You are great, sir. Get lost from here. I never ever imagined that someone such as you would ever fall for a guy like me. Never in 24 hours, 7 days or even 365 days. How did you ever fall for me? Girls don’t fall in love with a guy’s habits. Really? We would fall in love with his behaviour. and you have that. Is that so? What exact behavioural aspects of mine did you fall for? Never mind. Get lost. You guys never believe us anyway. How do you think you would be able to tolerate an alcoholic like me? How?! Wouldn’t your talent be enough? This company has developed a lot because of your talents. Why wouldn’t a girl fall for you? We will get married. and then, you will become a Managing director. My father will retire and rest at home. Such a happy life. Business deal... What’s wrong? Aryan sir, the MD is calling for you. I’m coming. He is my dynamic and diamond Aryan. He is the reason for the success of this project. He is the most talented person in my office. No...he is the most talented person in the city. Hey! Aryan?! Hey! Are you crazy?! What’s this nonsense? You and your company are taking advantage of my talent. And on top that you praise me... ...like it would take me to unimaginable heights. This is where you guys got me. I don’t think I can take this any longer. I can’t watch you and your daughter playing games with me. She says she doesn’t like my behaviour nor my character and yet she likes me. She is playing games with me. And you here... You don’t care if I drink here in the office. And you don’t care when I kiss your daughter. You don’t care at all. I can’t watch these games that you and your daughter play with me. I am done. I am done with you and your company. You guys thought I was a machine. Aryan! I am quitting this company. I quit this job. Aryan! Stop! -Good bye! Aryan! Why did you come here? Won’t you and your father let me live in peace? I loved you more than I loved myself. I was so in love with you. That is why I came here. Come. Let’s go. Where? To the office? Yes. How long will you stay this way? I can live alone by myself happily rather than living in a place with people I don’t like. I will be this way. You mean... you... you don’t need me anymore? I didn’t love you because I needed you. I wanted to be happy with you. That’s why I loved you. But now there is no happy. First, get out of the house. Goodness! He and his daughter have used you thoroughly. Don’t listen to him. You tell me. Why did you quit that job over something so insignificant? Do you think that’s insignificant? When they praised me 24/7, it really got on my nerves. And finally, even that girl. They treated me like a machine. This idiot here is really in between the devil and the deep sea because of his grandfather. Spill it, buddy. What can we understand if you stay silent? This old bugger! My entire life is wasted catering to them. This old croon! Be careful, please. Be careful. Take him carefully. This shitty life of mine! Because of him, I might have to skip dating and go straight to getting married. I’ll knock you. Who here is related to the patient? What happened to my grandfather? No problem at all. If he stays here for ten days, he would completely recover. Goodness! This old bugger really gets on my case! Why are you crying? You’ve done all there is to be responsible for this. Vijay, why is she crying so much? The doctor said that you might die in ten days. That’s why she is crying. It’s only my leg that’s hurt. Then, why do you ask?! As if it’s your wife who is in deep sorrow! You are overly enthusiastic about this?! First, you stop crying! I am guessing you wouldn’t be this sad if your husband was the one who lost a leg. This is too much! Grandson, why do you keep scolding her? Old man, just shut up! You stay here. I’ll be back. This old geyser needs fruits it seems! Stop at that house... Sir, that house, is it? -Yes Get down, you old hag. Watch your step. Slowly... Careful, sir. As long as you are there, I am perfectly fine. I can even jump around if you leave me once. Yeah, try that next time and I will break your legs. Wait! Don't enter yet. Sailaja, get me some vermilion coloured water. Yes, madam. How are you, Suresh? I am fine. Why is he overacting? Lakshmi, it's been so long.... you look so beautiful in this saree. Yes, I wore it because you like it. Oh! Here, madam, take this. Give it here. "Let the evil eye cast by neighbours be ward off; by people in the hospital be ward off; by the people in this town be cast-off" Please spit in this. He doesn't need all this. For the way he looks at them, I am sure they need this. He looks like an effigy! Please throw this away... Me? Are you out of your mind? My hands are not free; ask the maid Sailaja to throw it away. Give it to me, ma'am. -Yes, give it to her Welcome back dear Suresh I'll get you something to eat. What did she get me, now? Here you go some cashew nuts fried in clarified butter. Eat. Lakshmi, why do you love me so much? I am fine if you are fine. Only if Lakshmi is fine, this Suresh can be fine. Suresh... -Lakshmi..... Suresh... -Lakshmi..... Suresh... -Lakshmi..... Cashew nuts? Shucks, I can't handle this "old-age love" Will he compete in Olympics now, for him to eat cashew nuts? Give them to me. What's wrong with him? I wonder what you had to eat in the hospital. I will cook all your favourite dishes in a snap. Shailu... Shailu baby... Yes, sir. Why did you call me? Give me a nice massage. My body is aching. It feels like heaven, as you give me a message, Sailaja. Sailaja, do something so that the doors of heaven welcome me with open arms... Why don't you simply squeeze his neck and he will go to heaven? 420... 420...[Cheater] Dear, taste this lentil stew! It's so tasty. Hey Grandmother... While you are busy cooking in the kitchen, this old man here is having romantic flings. I am sure she will throw us out once she gets the property on her name. How can you insult your grandfather? He has never made any mistake in our entire 65 years of marriage. He is the epitome of Lord Rama. My Suresh is clean. Turn around; let me see your face. You never got caught by her in all these 65 years! Grandfather, sure there is a lot to learn from you. Water the plants, Sailaja. They are withering. Sure, madam Oh! God. Madam...madam... Sir... Madam... -Madam? Madam's foot slipped on the stairs. "Her foot slipped?"(Got pregnant?) Yes Sir. Stop your adult jokes. What happened? -She slipped off the stairs. Let's go...and check on her. -Let's go Grandmother. See for yourself, sir. Sailaja, help her get up. Careful. Where is she? Why did you have to go upstairs, grandmother? What were you doing when she slipped on the stairs? I was watching her, sir. Please take her to the hospital. Why? Are you worried that she is still alive? No, it's not like that. Lets take her to the hospital and get X-Ray and scanning done. Why are you playing the fool with my life? We will also get an MRI for her Fine, stop it! Are you a doctor to recommend all these? Well, how can I ignore it? Will get them done. You can not let me live peacefully. Hey, grandmother... Sailaja, go get an auto. -Okay, Sir. For how long should I make rounds to the hospital for the oldies? What is wrong with my life? What about you? All your problems sound very silly. Stop it! My problems are way different. Does he think he is a stud? -Stop beating around the brush, idiot. Watch today, "Jug in a Mug" Stop staring at me and start your saga. Hey, be ready with garlands and crackers. It's time for our Brother to be released. Start the 'teen maar' as he comes out. Sure, bro. Hey fatso, when will he come out? Wait, he will come. Hold on. How many murders have you committed to being jailed? Do you have such expectations? I was jailed for "drunk and drive". What? So much hype for drink and drive? That is how it is in our gully. Once out of a jail, they treat us as a high-flyer. Give that cigar to me. Give that cigar to me. Hey, enough stop it! -Hey, stop it! Do you think am I back from my honeymoon? I got worked up continuously for 3 days. Did they trouble you so much in the jail? Don't leak this story elsewhere. Otherwise, my respect will go for a toss. Okay. One has to wake us up early in the morning. Work until we sweat the hell out. And the food makes you think about the bathroom. Mosquitoes at night swarm around you. And tiresome mornings! I just could not bear a few days in jail. How could you survive the three days without any liquor? If you have the moolah, you can live a king-size life even in jail. No matter where our bro is, he is always a King! Come on, bring the beats on!! I got all joker cards Come on, play the card. Hey Jaggu... Why are you wasting time and spoiling your life by whiling away time with these fellows? Hey, tell him that I will break his bones if he ever bothers about my life. Listen to me... Why don't you open a mutton shop or a grocery shop? Mend your ways and make your life better. I will open those shops for you. You can sit and keep chanting, "chicken", "mutton" and sell as much as you want. Don't boggle my mind. If you try to wash the dirt off me, I am telling you, it stinks like a skunk. I am warning you. Hey, is it ready? -Yes, yes This time around, we have to celebrate Batukamma's festival with all show and pomp Okay, Brother. -Let's go Who is it? It's his childhood crush. Hey, Paaru, I've not seen you around since you are out of town. Is it? Damn it, are you my relation to enquire about you. Everything said and done... Your beauty is such that no King will restrain from showing his might. Who are you? You seem to be talking too much. What did he say? Wait... Is there a King who never showed his might? No. That's it. That's all. What? Dear, hold on. What business do we have with this useless fellow? Hey, get lost Fine, I'll leave just because left you. Are you giving out any tales? Get lost rascal. Okay. Fine, but don't forget to vote for "watermelon". You and your "watermelon" symbol. Get lost! Let's leave, bro. -Paaru is getting angry. I and Paaru are used to frolics since childhood. Namaste, Jaggu bro. Namaste. If you have any issues, our brother is right behind us. Sure. Hey Oldie... give donations for Batukamma's festival. Damn it, what donations are you asking for? You don't want to give any donations to Batukamma's festival? No...I won't give you. Give that money to me, you old lady. What a scoundrel you are. Here is the rest of the money. Why is there nobody to ask donations? I am wondering the same. Look, there is someone there. Hey, give donations for Batukamma's festival. I won't give you. What will you do? How dare you talk back to me in my area? You can't dare move an inch without paying me any donations. I will walk away without giving you a penny. Scoundrel, what can you do? Stay right here.... And I will beat you black & blue. Bro, hold on. Go away right now. Otherwise, you will definitely get beaten up, Walk away.. You did right by holding me back. Otherwise, you would have beaten him up badly. Definitely You are back... Come, have some food How long will you while away time like this? You just feed me on time. I know what to do. What are you saying? Will you keep roaming around wasting your time without any responsibility? Mom, stop it. So will you not take up any work? You should listen to your uncle. Him? It is better to slap myself than to listen to him. Where are you going? I am going to attend my friend's wedding. I'll be back after2 -3 months. Your fate seems so troubled. Even a married life isn't this worse. Stop it, guys. We are here not to dwell in our troubles but to forget them. That's a difficult task for me. Why is it difficult? Why? Listen to Aaryan. Let us all go out on a trip. Let's forget and simply enjoy our time. Are we not going to come back here? What will you do even if we come back here? Except than to drink in your party office and run around Paaru. Shut your gob and simply come along with us. Okay fine. Hyderabad, Delhi, Bombay... First, decide on a place. Guys, take me along. Who is this guy? Bro, I am deep in trouble. Who is this guy? Let us first decide on the place to go. Then we can discuss. Please, let me come along with you. Alright. Alright, let us go to Kerala or kullu manali. Why go to Kerala, to find coconut shells? Then where to go? Guys, let's go to Goa Yes, we will go to Goa. I am okay with it. I have always wanted to go there. Let's enjoy it! If you guys are okay, I am fine with it as well. But how shall we go? Why worry? I never had the opportunity to use my car. So let's go in my car. Okay. You piece of shit! I am stuck because of you. Please let me go! Please forgive me. Please let me go! Why did you do it? -Forgive me. Alright, fine. I’ll talk to you later. What’s your problem? Sir, I am the journalist who called you. I need to discuss something important with you. If you are able to successfully deal with that problem, you can be assured of a promotion. Promotion? Where? Where? -What is it? Is my promotion in your bag? Sir! I am a journalist. Sorry, sir. Go on. Tell me. The thing that I am going to discuss with you, should remain a secret between us. Alright, tell me. Its regarding the drug availability in Goa. Aren’t drugs in Goa quite common? This is not a straight forward drug. Sir, when one consumes those other drugs, the effect wears off in fifteen minutes to half an hour. But this drug is not like the others. It is quite dangerous. Stop the bike. Aryan, hi. Okay, bye buddy. You go on ahead. How long has it been since you got here? That’s all fine but how much longer? Where is he? How many times do I have to call him? -What? He isn’t here yet? That’s what I’ve been telling you. -Why fret, buddy? Let me call him. Buddy, where are you? I am on my way. On the way. We are waiting for you. I’ll be there in five minutes. Alright. Come. We met that guy in the pub last night. Yes. What was his name? Vikram. Where the hell is he? Hold on, I’ll call him. Call him. Where are you, buddy? We are waiting at the tea stall for you. Sorry, man. If my wife figures this out she will thrash me. All the relatives came down to our place. Sorry, man. I can’t come. -What’s his problem? Will he be here or wouldn’t he? He said he wouldn’t come. Then, just cut the call and let him go. Hello... What happened? Sir. what’s up with him? Sir, he is one of us. Then, warn him. I already did, sir. It will not be him the next time. If it is repeated once again... It will be you the one who dies.. Did you get that? -Yes, sir. This ass.... How much longer? I don’t think I can wait any longer. Will he be here or won’t he? Or do you want me to **** out of here?! Why take it out on me? I was here on time, right? Okay, wait. I’ll call him. Hello? Where the hell are you? Are you going to be here or not? I am already here. Do you see that white car in front of you? I am right behind it. Buddy... I wonder where the hell he is! Jerk! What’s wrong with him? Hi, I am here. Shit! I am back. Let me see how my hair was..? What happened? Is this even a car?! Goodness! Do you even know how long we’ve been waiting for you? You come here in a shitty car and have an attitude as well. Do you think we are going to Golconda in this car? We are going to Goa. You can call me names but don’t badmouth my vehicle. This fellow! And now, he is angry! Brother-in-law, I need to tell you something. What is it? I got a party interested in a bigger deal. No. No, I don’t want to do this now. I don’t want to get involved at all. I’ve already explained and sorted it with them. What is it? They are on the way. No.. no. Anyone here, please explain it to him. I will make sure you don’t land in a problem. I already told you, right? I already did. I will take care of it. I don’t want to do the deal. There is no one else who is interested either. Please, understand. Sir... Right. I must have worked hard for at least two years on this file. Ok Just make sure... (Coughing) Be careful. Don’t mind me. I have asthma and I didn’t even get my inhaler. Okay. I need to get home quickly. -Alright. You are sure I will be promoted with this, right? For sure. What happened, boss? Nothing much. Tell me what’s wrong? I put in a lot of effort to get this party to make a deal. But my brother-in-law, flat out refused it. If we cut that deal, we will be set for life. Then, you must have persuaded him. I did try but he refuses to give in. I am going to deal with the three of them who are the interested party and prove myself to the world. Jai Hanuman Buddy...this Blenders Pride, Black and White, Signature... Did you come from a land of drought? Jaggu, take a look at him. Look at what he’s packed. Idiot, we are going to Goa. We need company. That’s the reason I got them. Drunkard fellow. Did you bring at least one dress? Foolish guy! You are late and now you lecture me. First, start driving. Dive. This vehicle is an antique. It will go forward only if you guys push. What? You want us to get down and push it. I don’t think so! What the hell is this?! If you push, we can head to Goa or else we will be here. I wonder how long we would have to do this. I wonder how many times we would have to do this. Goodness! Come on, buddy. It’s started. Why is it so hot? I don’t think I can take this any longer. Jaggu, switch on the air conditioning. Aircon? My vehicle is not in such a prime condition. Open the window doors... and get chill Damn it! How did you come in a vehicle that has no Aircon? Why make a fuss about everything? There is sunroof. Use it. -Something is wrong. What’s this weird thing?! Sunroof...? Sunroof...?

Youth from Telugu speaking stateshave been caught red handed supplying drugs in Goa. Three Telugu-speaking youth, who had come to Goa for a visit, have committed crimes... and evaded the police after having committed kidnapping and gruesome murder of girls along with supplying drugs. Police suspect their involvement in many cases in Goa. Using Fingerprints and CCTV footage, they have collected evidence and the whereabouts of these accused, and are now on an intense lookout to nab the accused. What are these guys doing here? They came here? Let’s call him. Sir, I am the journalist who met you. I’ve found the criminals we were searching for. They are right here. Sir, please hurry. Please don’t do anything stupid like before. Please hurry. Get up! Wake up! Wake up! Young man! Wake up! Get up! I am telling you to wake up! Wake him up! Wake up! Who the hell are you? This early in the morning! I’ve been searching for you for a very long time. And now, I’ve found you. Who are you guys? Why did you come here? Please answer me truthfully. Well... it’s as usual. We must have slept off after we got sloshed. Why do you ask? Should we pay you the bill? Who is this guy? Who is this guy? Why don’t you ask him? Vijay, if there is some alcohol lying around, find it. I am a journalist. So? I don’t think you guys will believe me. ...this newspaper... What’s his problem? -Don't know. News paper.. Take a look at this. Look at the newspaper. Look. Read what’s written there. What the fuck?! Here, give it to me. I wonder why our photos are in the papers. I wonder what grand laurel we achieved?! Give it to me. Why would you delight in our photos appearing in the papers, Rather than knowing what’s it all about?! Sir! What is this? We didn’t commit any crime. We are suspects in at least 20 cases along with drugs and murder. What?! Goodness! These are all lies. Do our faces look like we can commit a murder? We are no way related. Sir, we are in no way connected to that. I don’t think you guys will believe me if I explain this way. ...it must be this. Here... take a look at this... take a look at this... They are you. What is it? They are your photos, right? -Oh goodness! Our photos. Vijay... my goodnesss! He’s got a photo of us peeing as well. There it is. What the hell is this, sir? I don’t understand what happened. What do you mean, we committed crimes? I don’t understand a thing. Give it to me... Give it. Who the hell are you guys? Why did you guys come here? We were frustrated with our lives... and came here for something new. Goa! Oh my god! Goa! Goa! Goa! Hey, wake him up. Buddy, Buddy, come out. Come on. How long will you sleep? Come on out of the vehicle. Are we here yet? Jaggu, this vehicle of yours...my god! We were literally in hell all through the ride. What happened, buddy? Do you call this a vehicle? I kept pushing it all through the journey and got sober! Take me to the closest wine shop around. What is wrong with you? Right after we got to Goa? Shouldn’t we at least shower? My god! First, we need to book the room, freshen up and look presentable. Everything else is after that. We need to dress in such a manner that everyone in Goa should take notice of us. Is that so?! Really! Wait, I am booking. The room should be in such a manner that ... once you open the curtains, spread our legs in front of us, the water should come and touch us. Why do you need a room for that? Just sleep on the beach. The water will definitely touch you. Never mind all that. Did you book the room? I did. Jaggu... Alright, let’s go. ...it’s right here...our palace. Hi, sir. Who is he? I am Joseph. I am the guide here. If you need anything, I’ll help you. What is he saying in English? He introduced himself as the guide here. Just for that... Telugu? I am a Telugu-speaking guy too. -Is that so? I am the guide here. If you need anything, I will arrange it for you. What does a guide mean? -You...illiterate fellow! Brother... I can arrange for anything. What are you going to arrange? Are you a broker?! Nonsense! As soon as you see a New guys you are out there to fleece them! Brother...you will definitely need my help in this place. If you need something, just call this number. Alright, let’s go. You get lost! Hello, sir. Good morning. Welcome to the River palace. Behave yourself! I have a room booked on the name of Aryan Yes, sir. -Check it once. Give me a minute, sir. -Take your time. Sure. Do you know the kind of room I prefer? It must have 24 hours of water supply. We don’t want the hassle of going down and getting buckets of water. Okay. I am warning you. Didn’t I warn her well? Disgusting! You have a room booked, sir. Have a nice day, sir. -Thank you. Apologies, he has a sugar problem. -Okay, sir. Wow! What’s this?! This really looks like a palace... It’s quite good. Buddy... the rest of our lives is going to be spent here. Let’s spend it happily. This is the appropriate place to let go of our problems. We must enjoy ourselves well. Oh goodness! What a gorgeous room! Jaggu, what will they do with such big TV? They will look really big. Hello...! Why are you sleeping here? -What do you mean? I put my bag here. I want this location. This is my place. Let it go, buddy. Hey, get up. Move from here. You simply don’t listen. Do you?! Here. Get out of here, stupid fellow! You get out. Get out of here. Stop it! Are you guys idiots? Don’t act like such cheapskates. How did I ever find guys such as you for friends? Hey! Hold on. (Mumbles a song) (whistles) What is it? What do you want sir? Wait buddy. Foolish fellow! Any girl would smile for me. Key. Room...spray...clean... Okay. Okay. -Okay. Sure, sir. Do you think you came here for a honeymoon? Come on. Bye. We are heading to the beach. See you later. Okay. Keep looking. What do you mean? Keep looking. It’s quite hot here. Let’s go to inside. Is it? -Yeah. Alright, let’s go. -Alright. That thin girl is for me. The one beside her is for you. Fool! I want the thin girl. Don’t you get it? What’s wrong with her? She looks good. She is a bit tiny. That’s all. That’s not called tiny. She is just stylish. Listen, don’t try to manipulate me. Why would a shitty face like you need such a girl? Listen, I am telling you. If I kick you, you will be stuck to the wall like a bubblegum. I already warned you. Hey! What kind of cheapskates are you?! Oh! This guy? Would you fight over a girl? Come, let’s go. My god, this fellow here. He doesn’t enjoy and neither does he let others enjoy. What does that mean? This is in Sanskrit. You wouldn’t understand. Bring a water bottle. Why are you ordering water? Did you get alcohol with you? No.. no. I will not be able to take you back when you are drunk. I cannot either. Absolutely not. I told you right. I don’t have alcohol on me. Thank you for this mercy! Why are you after me always? They are all quite good. Sir, order please. Cheers! Wow! The food’s arrived quite early. We are special here. Special. Guys, take out all the money you guys have on you. I have... I have these. This twenty-rupee note is for you. Take it. That’s all. You got so little money? Did you really think you would be able to live here in Goa? Yeah, right. Did you take a look at your face?! I have 20 grand on me. I have 10 grand on me. Then, we have a lot. We can enjoy a lot with that. Your entire life has always been about living off others. Did you ever get your own money? Tell me the truth. You begged for these, right? Always disrespect me. Like you are some kind of a politician! I will keep all the money with me. If you guys need money, ask me. Really? We shall spend these carefully. Why would the money be with you?

Hey Aryan, give me your credit card. Hey Aryan, give me your credit card. Give me some money. Come aside. -I'll get some food. Where? I forgot to tell you guys something. We used up all the money we had. Do you understand? From now on, we have to work hard and earn money. What is he saying? For fuel, for food...for everything and anything. We have to work and earn. After having so much fun, I cannot work hard. Hey, we had a very good time all this time till today. But now it's time we work hard to earn money. -No matter what you say, it's impossible. Don't you understand? -Stop it, guys. I am Manikonda Marrichettu Jaggu here. I am going to take the lead from today on. You are my teammates. Got it? Even that girl. --Are you going to take the lead? Are you going to take the lead? You? Don't you want some booze? Don't you want food? -True, I want. Let's go. Let's go. Selfie time with my team! Stop! Stop! Can you see the old woman near the ATM? Yes. Go grab that money from her. What? Me? No Go, I'll take care of the rest. It's a risky business. Just drive. Let's go. We'll have money for the next two days. Damn life! And that old lady hit me bad. And this guy is happily drinking away with the money I got with great risk. Hey, dry your clothes, away from me. Ok. And this girl... Wow! The Queen is awake. Hi... -Hi. Baby, baby... Good Morning... It's not morning, it's dusk. You are a bibulous girl. Get lost. -Wow! What drink are you having? Coconut with vodka. Really? -Yeah Mix some poison in it. And we can let go of this girl. Wow! -Nice? Nice. So, what is my special drink, today? We have Jaggu, the gang leader. No, I am not going to lead anymore. I am done and dusted. Vijay will take the lead from now on. Hello, I can't do this. You lead the gang. Baby, I want a drink. Wait, baby. Jaggu, please. Just this one time. I can't do it. I give up. But you said that you will lead us... I can't do this. What kind of cheap guys are these two? Oh! It's this guy... An insult to Telugu speaking people. What is the issue? This Jaggu had to take the beating of an old lady near the ATM. And this Vijay had a good share of beatings at the market for stealing food. What is all this? -He knows about this too? What can we do? We have no money to drink or eat. You just can't steal if you have no money. Well then, give us some work. I am a broker myself. How can I help you? Then shut your mouth and leave. Go, get lost. Get lost from here. Bro, I have a deal for you. If you close that deal, you can earn 15 lakh rupees. What? 15 lakhs? You have nothing much to do. Simply get the 100-year-old wine bottle. And you can walk away with the 15 lakhs. Baby, I want to drink. -I need ten percent commission. But why are you telling us? I am telling you because there is a risk involved in this deal. Risk? The Police, Gangsters, are involved. There will be a lot of chasing too. Let us do it. I am okay with the deal. Baby, go for the deal. Deal okay. Stop it. How can you do this? He said that it's risky. Police, gangsters are involved. Are you guys out of your mind? Hey, you...leave. No deal. I've always told you, don't be friends with Jaggu. Leave him. Let us go for the deal. Vijay don't you try to break our friendship. Let's go. I will join you. Okay, listen to the plan. Hey, Aryan they look dangerous. I am getting scared. -Hey .. let's go back. -Leave me. Chest up..Chest up Chest up... Chest up. Hello... Code, please. "The fish of the sea shy's away" Code. "The crow's dropping is white in colour" Box... -You, say the code Jaggu, say the code. -No code.. no deal. Tell him the code Jaggu. -Wait man. No code, no deal. One minute Tell him the code Jaggu. Are you forgot the code? Tell him the code Jaggu. No code, no deal. -Wait. Come on.. tell him. Hey, police. Hay, they are running away. Hey... Why are you here? -Give me the box. Let's go... fast. Where? Where are those fellows? I am going to catch them and snatch the promotion. How the hell gave you this job?! You must have some brain at least. Idiot! You ruined the entire plan. I’ve spent countless months of sleepless nights and hunger... stayed away from my family to continue this research and finally gathered this information. You ruined it! Me? Would a police officer switch on his siren for a clandestine operation such as this? Useless fellow! The police would go under cover. Don’t you even know that much?! I should punish myself for having phoned you. Useless bugger! Anyways... Well, the box has already been exchanged. What’s going on? We’ve just been running around in circles. Well, this isn’t working. You guys go that way. I will get the vehicle around. Hey!Come on. Come on. -Be careful. You can do it. Buddy, I’ll be right back after I pee. Water... You need water? Yeah. Wait...I’ll get it. Hey! Who is that? What?! These guys are here? Hey! Hey! Hey! That guys look like a buffalo. Doesn’t seem like they would leave me alone. Aunty, please give me some water. Thank you. Hey! Where is my bag? Bag! Give me my bag! Give me the bag! Where is the bag? Nice hairstyle. Hey, what are you doing? Nice body. What are you doing? Come with me. My legs are aching. Where is this guy? -Where are we? Give me the box. Damn it! Give me the box. -Leave her alone. Give me the box. Come on. Keep running. Keep running. -Where is Vijay? Where is Vijay? Vijay? Hurry up and get the vehicle ready. Get in. Get in. Start the vehicle. Hurry! Hurry! Let’s go. Let’s go. Drive fast. Did you steal it? Did you steal the box? Where is it right now? Where is it right now? Tell me. Tell me. Well, the thing is...we stole the box but we don’t remember where the box is. Idiots! Idiot! Tell me where the box is. Tell me where the box is. Tell me...Tell me. Where is it? Sir... sir... Hold on. Hold on. Tell me. After we stole the box... -Tell him. ...we went to the place Joseph told us to go to. Finally, we achieved it. Woah! Yay! Yay! Yay! What do we do now? What else do we have to do?! Take it and give it to Joseph. You.. We worked so hard to get the box. Would you just hand it over without looking into what’s in it? That’s true. Open it. Open. Door...what about doors? Did you lock all of them? Buddy, you open it. What’s with all this fuss? We did something like this for the very first time in our lives. Open it. Open it. Open. Please, open it. Come on. Come on. -Hurry up. What’s with his face? What is this? What is this? Shit! What is this? Give that to me. -Hey wait. I want to look at it. Wait, hold on. I am taking a look, right. -Hold on... Hold on. Hold on...it’s going to fall. I said I want to take a look. -Hold on... Hold on... My god! You idiots! Can’t you be patient? You are the one who is entirely responsible for this. What is that? What is that? What’s happening? My head is spinning. My eyes are burning. What is this?! What is this?! We don’t remember anything after that, sir. I will tell you exactly what happened after that. Baby, go for the deal. You had already consumed the drug. So, they used you as an experimental weapon to go out and kill those people that they didn’t get along with. Don’t you want to sell it? Hurry up. We need to hurry up and sell this. Why are you scared? Why are you scared? No... Are you scared? Anyone with even a bit of brain needs to have a lot of guts to come here. You must never be afraid in a business such as this. Were you scared? This guy got scared. He is such a scaredy-cat. No.. bro.. no. I shall deal with you. That is how that Joseph and Maggie trapped you into committing the crime. That is what happened. Maggie isn’t such kind of a person. Be careful with your words. Damn it! Does she matter more to you than us? Ever since I met that girl, I’ve had my suspicions. I am warning you. Don’t talk smack about her. You were the one who said “Bros before hoes” and now, you talk this way. You just met her a couple of days ago. How can she mean more to you than us? If you talk one more word about her, I will not tolerate it. Of course, we will talk. - We can! We can! What are you going to do about it? We can! What am I going to do? -Yes, what is it? Hey, listen to me. -Aryan, stop it! What’s with this fight?! He is your childhood friend. Why fight over a girl? -Apologize. No... I don't Apologize to you. You have to apologise me. Will you apologize or not?! -No... I won't. Vijay is always like this. -Say sorry. -Aryan, stop it! Will you apologize or not?! Stop it! I know a police man. He will be able to help you in many ways. Before, I lose my breath... ...boys...listen to me. I am going to save you guys. Listen to me. Apologize. -I won’t. You say apologize. Vijay... Sir... I won't. I won’t apologize. Sir... Apologize. I won't say. Say sorry. - I won't say. Say... Aryan! He is dead. Hey, move. He is dead. What are you talking about? Why have our lives turned this way? 20 cases? What the heck?! 20 cases on us. Sir! When I was caught driving drunk, the police were on my case. I can’t handle these twenty cases. The one who came to help us is also dead. Sir! He is dead. In these circumstances, even if we tell people that we had nothing to do with the crimes, they would never believe us. What did we come here for? And what the hell have we gotten ourselves into? I am missing my grandfather and grandmother. I am also missing my parents. Let’s try to solve our problem by ourselves. First, if we figure out where Joseph is, we would at least have an opportunity to get out of this mess. That’s true. First, we must find out where he is. Wait! Sound... -Someone’s coming this way. Who could it be? Come, let’s go. Hey... Come, let’s go. What do we do with his body? Stay here and keep guard! Guard it. Be careful! Hey, don’t. I am scared of dead bodies. Let’s go. Hurry. Wait up! I’m coming too. Wait. Hurry! Vijay, come on. Start! Keep going. Drive! Drive! Drive fast. Brother? Tell me. Can you take us to ‘Khad’ island? Come. Let’s go. Come on. -Let's go. Found him! Get on. Hurry. How do you know that he would be there? When we were drinking together the other day, didn’t he mention it? Didn’t he say that he would be here? Hold on. Stay still. Brother, that way. That way. There..? Yup! Found him! Come on. Hurry up. Let’s go! -Let’s go. I'll take care... you move on. Hit him! Hit him! Thrash him! You piece of shit! Why are you hitting me? Hitting you? You are responsible for the crimes we are accused of. You piece of shit! What crimes? Why are you hitting me? Spill it! Spill it! Where is Maggie? Where is Maggie? I don’t know. Where is Maggie? How come he isn’t talking even after getting beaten up? Where is Maggie? Where is Maggie? This is a waste of time. I don’t think he will change. Where is Maggie? Where? Always about her. Tell me, where is Maggie? What’s with this Maggie business? First, we must kill Maggie. Jaggu... come. Let’s go. This piece of shit! -Let's go. Good morning, sir. I want to tell you something, sir. Tell me. It’s regarding them. About them? -Yes, sir. Sir, take a look at this file once. File? Sir, this is the most dangerous drug that has ever made its presence in Goa. It’s because of this drug that they are in this situation. A person who has taken this drug gets in a trance within a span of seconds. A journalist was investigating this issue and died The entire information regarding his investigation is on this. In this? -Yes, sir. Who is Joseph? What do you mean we murdered? Do our faces look like people who go around murdering around town? [Police listening Audio evidence] I found Joseph from the photos that the journalist took. Yes, sir. It’s him. Every time they committed a crime in that state of trance, they paid Joseph off. The thing is...he is not Joseph. His name is Sameer. Sameer? Sameer? He is the brother-in-law of that gangster Deepak. He took to dealing with the drug when his brother-in-law rejected the offer. Sir, I was suspicious of him so, I tapped his phone. I found out that... ...he has a crime partner. Crime partner? Who is he? His name is Vikram, sir. Vikram, I have good news for you. I discussed the deal with them. Did you tell them anything about what’s in the box? I told them that there is a bottle of wine in it. Damn it! Why would you say that? Aryan is a big drunkard! He will most definitely open the box. If he opens the box... Damn it! You screwed the entire plan. What do I do now? Listen to me carefully. Just follow those guys with a couple of our own. When the box’s exchanged... ..Exactly when the box’s exchanged, do something or the other and grab it from them. Be careful. Be careful with the police there. Sir, they were carefully selected for the plan right from Hyderabad. Where do we go then? Let’s go to Goa. Oh my goodness, that was him!. -Was that him? Vikram from Hyderabad? They were supposed to be elsewhere but they were distracted and brought here. Sir, Vikram is the one who planned the entire deal. Sir, not just him. He has a girlfriend too. If you thrash the shit out of him, I am sure she will make an appearance as well. Yes, sir. She would. Vijay! What is it?! What?! At least now, let’s try and get out of this mess. If it leaks out that they committed a crime because they were on such a drug... Goa’s tourism would take a massive hit. We might get some information if we intensely interrogate Sameer. How did you get this deal ? Tell me. Tell me. Where is it? Spill it! Where is it? Speak out! Are the both of you playing games with us? Spill it! I will show... Say it... I will show... -Say it... I will show it to you, sir. Sir, this girl’s photo is in our station’s file of missing girls. Sir, this girl too. Even this child here... ...it’s a missing case. Okay. Okay. Let’s go. Get them all in the van. Let me go! Please. Please let me go. Leave me alone. Leave me. Please let me go. No! No! -Please let me go. No. No! Please. No.. no... no. No! Please leave me. Aryan... Aryan... Aryan... The situation here is worse, sir. Along with Maggie, they have kidnapped a lot of girls and were in the midst of selling them off into prostitution rackets. What happened, buddy? Look at how they’ve hit her. Sorry, Aryan. I was totally wrong about this girl. Sorry, buddy. Please forgive me. Sir, please don’t let that guy go. It’s okay, sir. The journalists are swarming out there. Let’s go. If it was his mother or sister, would he do the same thing? Sir, if you can’t do it, let me. I’ll shoot that dog! Please don’t stop me. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Pleas, stop. Stop him! -Aryan stop. Stop Sir! Sir! (Overlap Voice) Are you out of mind? Jaggu, leave me. Stop, buddy! Stop! Buddy, stop! Stop the car!
