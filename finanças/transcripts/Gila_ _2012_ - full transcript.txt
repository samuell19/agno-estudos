Records are meant to be broken. Yeah, but that crate you're driving must be rocket powered or something. Hardly. Fact is, tires are feeling a little splashy today. Swell. Now I feel even worse. You sure know how to rub it in, don't you? Hey, I'll tell you what, Pike. Why don't you bring her into the shop? We'll figure out a way to squeeze a few more horses into her. Okay? That'll be all kinds of okay. Thanks. So. You think you got the fastest wheels in the county there? Yeah. Sometimes I do. Robert. It's Waco. Waco Bob. This here is Carla. This sweet ride she's had her butt parked in is the Bobcat. 'Cause she moves so fast. Not with that engine. Need a tuneup. You do that carburetor yourself? Didn't come here looking for a tuneup. Came here looking for you. We're a lot of miles away from junior high, Winstead. I don't knowhow you find me. What'd you have in mind, Waco? Or you just gonna stand there, move air? Now listen, we can talk or we can race. Unless of course you're chicken. Hey, why don't you just ice it, man? Hey, I wasn't talking to you, Pointdexter. Now what do you say, Winstead? You up for it or do you need to ask your girl there for permission? Would that be okay, sweetheart? Go right ahead. Let's do it. I'm Lisa, by the way. I'm with Chase. Charmed. Love your top. Love yours, too, what there is of it. Like I said, need a tuneup, Robert. Told you, it's Waco. And what was with you cutting me off and pushing me into that pothole in the last turn, huh? It's called racing. This isn't over, Winstead. Not by a long shot. I look forward to it. Let's make this quick. Hey, you don't have to tell me twice. I gotta tell you, Joe. This place gives me the creeps. Look, for what they're paying us to dump this stuff here, you can have all the creeps you want. Okay yeah, but let's just not linger here no longer we have to. Man, I wanna get out of here. Relax, in one hour, we'll be at the Haven eating a steak. One, two, three. Lift with me, lift with me, come on. Man, if anybody finds out that we've been putting this stuff in here for over a year, we're done. Look, nobody comes back here, not even the kids. It's too far out in the sticks. I hope you're right. What's that? Hey, baby. Hey, why don't you get your sweet butt over here? We're hungry. Can I take your order? Hey, that's nice accent. What is that, French? What? I'm from Denmark. Here for the school year. Oh, right. Tell you what. Get us two burgers, some fries, and two chocolate shakes. Strawberry. And maybe a little danish later. All right, thanks. Make it quick. Hey, Chase. Pike. Guten tag, Chase. Hey, Elsa. Where's Lisa? I had to drop her off at home. She's helping her mom bake cookies for the Christmas fundraiser. Okay, well what can I get for you? Just a quick burger. Why so quick? I gotta go home and change. I'm going to the town square for the tree lighting. You know, for the art craft for the sneak preview. Mind if I join you? Yeah sure, come along. Okay, I'll be right back. Hey, Winstead. Robert. Hey, listen. Let's say we forget the burgers and settle this thing on the I44, huh? Take nearly an hour to get out there. Be near dark by then. So? So I don't race at night. I don't race at night. You afraid I'll beat you this time? Only an idiot would race that road in the dark. You never were all that bright, were you? Here's your meal. Here's your tip. That son of a B. Someone oughta jail his sorry hide. Thank you, mister. Pike. Pike Ostrovski. Elsa. Elsa Van Yoursen. Jimmy Dean to share his little black book. Telling you, baby. I'll take him on anytime anywhere. Let it go, Waco. You already lost to him once today. Why push it? Told you before. That was a fluke. Just cut me off is all. I guess I must've missed that part. I'm just stating fact. This whole town never cut me a break. They hated my old man. They hated me. Stoke a gallon of milk to feed my little sister. They sent me to juvie for three years. I'll show 'em. All of 'em. Especially Winstead. How do you know him anyway? He's just a rusty hubcap in junior high. Always thought he was special. The next time we meet, he'll be roadkill. If you don't slow down, we're gonna be roadkill first. I tell you, ole boy, pass me my lawyer. I think your horse is pregnant. Watch this. No, don't. Whoa, look out. Are you crazy or something? I told you when we first met I'm crazy to the bone. Crazy for you that is. Aw. Damn drunk drivers. They should keep 'em off the road. Do you see that? I don't believe it. I think we should get out of here. I agree entirely. Go.

Yeah, we well. Wilma, I'm on Main Street. I'm gonna be here for awhile. How was the tree lighting, Sheriff? Oh, it was beautiful as usual. I have to check it out on my way home tonight. Think you're gonna need any backup out there? Wilma, I think I can handle any mayhem that comes my way. Well, give us a holler, you know, if things get out of hand. You know I will, Wilma. You know I will. Hey, Wilma. Hey, Sheriff. Oopsy daisy. Little professional reading there, Wilma? Sorry, Sheriff. Just keeping up with some of the more sordid cases. Yeah, yeah, I got it. So, what else do I need to know about around here? Sherwood Compton's in the presidential suite sleeping it off. Where was he this time? On his car. You mean in his car. On his car. He fell asleep on the roof of his Buick. Sheriff's office. Yes, sir, he's right here. Just a moment, sir. It's the mayor and his clam sounds steamed. Yeah, Mayor, how can I help you? Yeah. Okay. Okay, I'll be right out there. What a jerk. Sorry, Sheriff. No, it's all right, Wilma. I appreciate a woman who speaks her mind. Just wait 'til I catch him speeding one of these days. I'll whip the cuffs on him so fast. Yeah, you will, won't you? All right now listen, Wilma. Sherwood wakes up, you give him a cup of coffee, all right. That's three sugars. One small cream. 10 four, boss. Hey, guys. Hey, Sheriff. How goes it? Oh, the usual. Out fighting crime in the most dangerous town on the earth. Is that what I think it is? Missy's polio braces. Finally. It's gonna make a great early Christmas present. Oh, that's great. It's gonna be a happy Christmas at the Winstead's, isn't it? Having problems with that axle? No, no. Running smooth as glass. There is something you can help me with though, Chase. Name it. Do you know anything about kids dragging racing out on County Road 12 yesterday? Because the livestock at the Swenson's farm getting kind of worked up. I don't want all the racket riling them anymore. Well, I see anyone dragging out there, I'll certainly let you know. All right, that's fair enough. Lisa. Hello to your mother and to little Missy. All right. Hi, Chase. Hi, Lisa. Hey, sis. Is that you, kids? Yep, we're home. What are you guys hiding there? Just a little early Christmas present from Santa Claus. My braces. That's right, honey. They arrived this morning. Oh, come here. Oh. Oh Chase, thank you. You're the best brother any girl could ever have. Forget about it, Missy. Just get you walking. Coming. I'm coming. Well, my, my, my, Sheriff Parker. What brings you all the way out here? Mrs. Wheeler. You call me Vera now. Is that the sheriff? In the flesh. About damn time. Honey, would you like yourself a bloody Mary? I make 'em a little extra spicy this time of year. No, thank you, ma'am. I'm on duty. Sheriff. Mayor. Missed you at the tree lighting last night. Parker, my daughter didn't come home last night. I haven't heard from her since yesterday. I want you to go and find her now. Do you understand? Well sorry to hear that, but Mayor, maybe she just spent the night with some friends. Not without calling. Well, is she seeing anyone in particular? Yes, that miscreant Donald Fielding, against my strong objection I might add. Donny Fielding? I know Donny Fielding. He's a good kid. Not as well as I do. He's like the rest of those hot rodders. Obsessed with speed, loud music, and living lives with no direction or purpose. And Norbert thinks that's a bad thing. Tsk, tsk, and tsk. Be quiet. I want a full investigation, Sheriff. This might even be a kidnapping. People know I have money. He's got it. He don't spend it, but he's got it. Would you keep your mouth shut, Vera? Like the painting, just call me Mona Vera. Now hold on, Mayor. The accusations of kidnapping are pretty serious charges. Why don't we all just wait 'til we find out a little bit more, all right? You just find my daughter. Results, Sheriff. That's the only thing that'll keep that badge on your shirt. Are we clear about this? I'll do what I can. Call me when you know something. I will. You sure you don't want a little bit of this to go? I can put it in a thermos for ya. The Sheriff has more important things to do, Vera.

You called it earlier, Chase. He seems more like wacko to me. If it weren't for wackos like that, I wouldn't have a job. Besides, that kid's had some bad luck. Lisa, Chase, I need to talk to you for a minute. That country hick cop shot at me. What right did he have stepping in like that? Blah, blah, blah. You lost. Get used to it. This isn't over yet. You hear me? He's gonna pay. I've hated Winstead since junior high. Not to mention that damn sheriff. They're all gonna pay. Sure, sure. Whatever. Can we get something to eat now? Yeah, baby. Have either of you seen Don or Betty lately? It's been awhile. Day or two. Is that unusual? Kind of. Don loves horror films and it was really pretty strange he and Betty weren't at the picture last night. He's been talking about it all week at school. And Don was supposed to bring his ride in for an oil change today. Well, did he? Nope. He didn't call and cancel or anything? Not a peep. I'm not sure if it makes any difference, Sheriff, but lately Betty's been talking a lot about eloping. She's crazy about Donny, but it's not a secret that she's not so crazy about her dad and his new wife. I think she just wanted out. Tell me where they might go if they wanted some quiet time alone away from the Wheelers. Sure. I can show ya. Just give me a minute to get cleaned up. Better take two. You got yourself a good kid there. Oh my dear, the blessed cow got loose. Give me one minute. I'm gon' take a little look around. Maybe those pesky coyotes again. Okay, but get this done before your dinner gets cold. Quiet, Shep. Come on out, you pesky bastards. I know you're in here. Mr. Swenson. Mr. Swenson. Find anything, Sheriff? Not a thing. You know it seems strange to me he'd leave his car just sitting here like this. I know Don. He wouldn't leave his wheels sitting for nothing. All right. You guys look around here. Scour the area. I'm going down by the wash. See if I can find anything. You okay? I'm fine. I know what that means. That Waco character said he found you again. He didn't say that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he did. I haven't seen that guy in 15 years. Since grade school. He was a troublemaker then, too. Just couple feet shorter. And that Carla chick waving her keister and other parts your way. What's up with that? I am not interested in her keister or any other part of her undercarriage. Believe me. Chase, Lisa, come on down here. This hers? I think so. Yeah, I'm sure. Is that blood? I'm afraid it is. That should be Wilma. I called her on the radio. Told her to come out here, give us a hand. Let's go, come on. Got here as quick as I could, Sheriff. I've been on the phone all day. Funny taking calls about missing livestock, and broken fences, odd property damage. Old man Smooth thinks the martians have landed. Plus I got a complaint. Shots fired at the Swenson farm a while ago. And Mayor Wheeler has been just. Well you know. Yeah, I know. We may have some foul play involved Betty Wheeler and the Fielding boy. Foul play? What happened? Well, we found the car and that's it. I found this purse down by the wash. Any cash inside? Some, but this isn't a robbery, Wilma. What do you want me to do, Sheriff? I want you to treat this like a crime scene is what I want you to do. I want you to take pictures, scour the entire area, and keep moving 'til you lose the lines. It's gonna be dark soon so you gotta move. Chase, I suggest you go to Compton's, get the tow truck. Impound this car. Sure thing, Sheriff. You said something about shots fired out of Swenson's. The Colson boy called it in from the farm next door over an hour ago now. Oh God. Well I better head on out there. I'll be searching here 'til sunset, Sheriff. You can count on me. I always do, Wilma. You know that, I always do. Karl. Karl. Maybelle. Karl. Karl. Maybelle. Karl. Karl, you in there? Maybelle. Karl, what happened? It's big. So big. What was too big?

Sheriff, I still need that ambulance over at Four Corners. Over. You're a big fella. Aren't ya? Sheriff Parker, come in. Over. Go 'head, Chase. I found Betty Wheeler alive at the site. Is she talking? No, she's breathing, but that's about all. I dropped her off at Doc Loomis'. Oh and Deputy Powers called in a crash near Four Corners. I'm almost there now. Well that's strange. I haven't been able to get her on the radio for about a half hour, Chase. That's just about the time I got her message. All right listen, Chase. When you see her, you tell her to call me immediately. You got that? Yes, sir. Over. Thank you. How's he doing? He's stabilizing. He's gonna pull through. Sheriff, what happened out here? I don't know. It's gonna take some investigating to find that out. But listen. Are you sure you saw my deputy when you were on your way out here? Yeah, I saw her. I saw Wilma. Is there something wrong? You do me a favor. When you go back to the hospital, you take county five to get back. That's 10 miles out of my way. Humor me, all right. Whatever you say. County's paying for gas anyway. Hey, you call me when you get back there. Damn those hot rodders. Where's that lazy, good for nothing Sheriff when you need him? Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor. Can I take this kid's license away? No, that wouldn't be legal. Son, are you aware of how many laws you just broke here? Sorry, Mayor, but Chase Winstead lent me a car and told me to come get you right away. He found your daughter. Betty, where? Down at Wilson's Wash. Chase took her to the hospital. The hospital? Charlie, go and get my car. Bring it around here. But Mayor, don't you remember I sent it to Compton's this morning for a tuneup? I can take you there, Mayor. Hop in. Charlie. Call my wife. Tell her to meet me there. Yes, sir, right away. Okay son, this once I'm asking. Show me what you got under there. Yes, sir. Deputy. Deputy. I've never been so happy to see your light, Sheriff. Anything? There's a dead guy in the car over there. What? What about Wilma? I don't know. I've been calling her out, but nothing. All right, let's go. All six. Sheriff. Sheriff, I think I might know what's going on. I think I saw something. What do you mean something? Something. It passed me in the road. It looked like a giant shadow. It was big, huge. It had a tail like a lizard. What are you talking about lizard? Like a huge lizard. Almost the size of a dinosaur. Now when was this? About an hour ago in my rear view mirror. Now Chase, are you sure you're not imagining this? That is what I'm trying to convince myself, but it's not working. Sheriff, what if some mutant creature does exist? And what if it's walking around out there wreaking havoc? I mean, that could be what killed Don. Maybe Betty barely escaped by hiding from it. Well that's a lot of what ifs, Chase, but you're right. I agree. There's something weird happening here. That's for sure. Scares the hell out of me. Think we should get out of here before it gets dark. That's a good thought. I'll send an ambulance out here to get this guy. Let's get out of here. Hey, I'm home. Hi, Chase. Stay there. What am I staying here for? Because I wanna come over to you. We've been practicing all day. Are you ready? I'm ready. That was so great, honey. I'm so proud of you. But I've been practicing all day and I wanted to make it all the way. It's your first day with the braces. You're a little bit tired. That's okay. Did amazing. Come on, it's time for dinner. There you go. Thanks, Chase. Just gonna wash off the dirt from the day. And I'll start serving. Everything okay with Lisa, Chase? Yeah, we're great. Mom, were you planning on heading into town tomorrow? I was. Will you do me a favor and stay home? Why? Sheriff told me not to say anything 'cause he doesn't know for sure. He just wants you to stay inside. Escapee from Hattonville maybe. Just wanna make sure you're safe just in case. Well, I guess I can put things off for a day or two. More time for Missy. Tell the Sheriff thank you. I will. What's for dinner? Your favorite. PTA casserole. Yum. Sheriff. Sheriff. Deputy. Hello, Sheriff's office. What's going on there, Sheriff? That's your deputy's car, ain't it? Yeah and that car's part of a police investigation, Sherwood, so you keep your hands off of it. You hear? I'll put a tarp over it later, but where's Wilma? Well, let's just say Wilma's missing in action, okay. All right. Now Chase, you keep this quiet now, you hear? Sure thing, Sheriff. Old man Smooth was in earlier mumbling something about martians killing our livestock to starve us to death. Can you imagine? May very well be martians, Mr. Compton. Might be martians? They look like huge lizards. Lizards the size of a bus. You seen one of 'em yourself? Might have. At least the tail. Tail, huh? Could be commie animal tests. Fluoridation. That's their style. Spread confusion. Create doubt. That's the commie way. Whatever it is, Mr. Compton, it's bad. Whatever it is, Chase, I'm gon' be ready. How so? Let me show you. Three wars I've been in, Chase. WW1, WW2, and Korea. I seen stuff nobody should see. Preparation, Chase. That's what saves lives. That's what I told my Martha. God bless her. I don't care if it's commies or martians. I'm a be ready. Yeah, you are. Yes. Yes, I understand your pigs are gone. What do you expect me to do about it, Henny? No, I will not reimburse you for your loss. There's no reason to use that kind of language with me. Hello. Hello. Where the hell have you been? The phones have been ringing off the hook. Where's that deputy of yours? I'm not sure. What do you mean? It means I'm not sure. You're always protecting her. I warn you if you- - Knock it off. You just knock it off. Now Deputy Powers is missing and Maybelle Swenson is missing and they might be a lot worse off than your daughter. You'll have to excuse me. So I get home the other day and there's the wife just about to sign a contract with some aluminum siding. Hey, that'll spruce up your place. Nice if you get paint, too. All right, all right. That ain't the point. This fast talker's got my wife on the verge of shelling out to him 800 bucks worth of my hard earned cash. That ain't going down. I walk in the door and there's Billy Sweat shoving the pen into her white, little hand. I'm here to tell ya I put my foot down hard on that action right then and there. Hey, there's something on the track up there. Looks like it's moving. Yeah, I see that. Dollar worth of donuts that's Anderson's bull out of the pen again. I'll give it a blast. Yeah, that ain't no cow. Go on, get out of here. Jump. Oh snap. Now Linden, I appreciate all the effort you've gone to on this report, but you're gonna have to help me out and put it in English so I can understand it. Well, basically that sample you collected is saliva. Saliva? Yeah, heloderma suspectum saliva to be exact. It was relatively easy to figure out the species based on the high venom content. What species are we talking about here, Linden? Well, in simple English, Matt, a helo monster. Although it's not very monstrous. They only get two or three feet in length. What if it got bigger? How much bigger? Bigger. Like as big as a car. Well, I would most certainly be worried. All right, if you were looking for one of these helo monsters, where would you look? Shrub lands, sanded wooded areas mostly. Are they always on the prowl? This time of the year they move around looking for food getting ready to hibernate. They usually return to their nest when they've had their fill. Nests? Yeah, usually some place protected from the elements like a cave. Say Matt, when did lizards become so darn interesting to you? Oh, I'm thinking about getting some house pets. What I've gathered it's a mutation of some sort. Something made it bigger. I just don't know what. Radiation? Well that can be, but now we got another problem. The professor I talked to he said that now's the time the year they lay their eggs. Think we need some help. Yeah, we need some help, but what am I gonna do? Call the state police and say hey come help us, we've got a giant helo monster chasing us around. So what are we gonna do? Come here. Okay, here's the Swenson's farm. Here's where we found Wilma's cruiser. And here was Don's last location. Seems like it's foraging out from the quarry caves. You think that's where it nests? It needs a place that's dark and safe to lay its eggs. So what do we do? We find it. We kill it. You got a plan? No. I might have an idea. Hey, just a minute, boys. That nitro there is some dangerous stuff, especially if you don't know how to use it. Come on now, Chase, you work for me. I'm your boss. Where's your loyalty? I know, Mr. Compton, but he's the sheriff. What am I supposed to do? Sherwood, this is a top secret government operation. You understand what I'm saying? I thought so. Besides, you've got enough stuff in here to get 50 years in prison. I got every right to bear arms. It's in the bill of rights. I got a copy right here in my back pocket. Sherwood, this is a fortress. Now come here, I wanna talk to you. Hey, babe. How's Betty doing? No visitors allowed yet, but I called the hospital this morning and they said she's still in critical condition, but she's doing better than last night. That's some good news for a change. Yeah. I need everything you've got. You got any more of these around here? I can't talk about that right now. Well I'm asking. Hey, hey. Over here. What's going on? What's with all the guns? What are you doing? It's a long story, honey. Well, I'm listening. Something is poaching livestock and the sheriff needs some help. You know to find it. Help? Since when are you help? Where's his deputy, that Wilma woman? Chase, we gotta get going. Go where? Chase. - See you later, baby. - Chase. Mr. Compton, what's the story? What's Chase doing with the sheriff? Lisa girl, I'll tell ya, but we gotta keep it between ourselves. It's martians. Think it's in there? That's the $64 question. Professor Dawes says this time of year early evenings, mornings, they're out foraging for food. How do we know this is the cave? Well, it's the biggest cave in the county. Closest to all the crime scenes. So in effect we're guessing. We're investigating. How long do we stay here? We're not gonna stay here. Oh no. Yup, we're going in. Get the nitro. Go on. All right. Sure you wanna go in there? To be honest with you, I'd rather be any place on the planet than right here right now. Yeah, me too. I guess I'm ready. Well, I'm not ready, but if we stay out here any longer, I'm gonna get frostbitten toes. Now what do you want me to do with this nitro? I want you to put the nitro right over there by the entrance. If we have to run coming out, I don't wanna blow us up. You know how to use this thing? I guess you know how to use it. All right, let's go. This place is creepy. You got it. What the? Those look like crickets. They're as big as chickens. Uh uh, no. Those are big enough to eat chickens. Must be what the thing eats when it's not outside. No, don't touch that. Sh. Go, go. Let's move, move. Get out. Get out. Can't believe we got him. We did it. I believe we did. What? Those crickets. Little on the big side. No, I hate 'em. I hate 'em. Let's go, Sheriff. Hello again. This is Santa's little helper Johnny Langostina speaking to you on the holiday hotline. Who's this on the line? Dottie Madden. You got a request for Johnny Langostina, honey? Can you please play "Little Dipper"? Whew. Can't tell you I'm not happy to see these babies again 'cause I am. They do the job for you, Sheriff? Yeah, like the perfect old soldiers they are. Put a nick in it looks like. You make a pretty good deputy, Chase. Thanks, Sheriff. What are you gonna do now? Betty, Don, the others. Those drums. Who dumped 'em? I don't know. I got work to do. Thanks. Don't mention it, Sheriff. I'm serious. You oughta think about becoming a deputy. I'll give it some thought. All right. I'm gone. Chase, before you take off on your new career, you might take a look at Marcy Robinson's ailing Buick in the garage. Yes, Mr. Compton. I'll get to it right away. Thank you. So have you lived all your life in Denmark? No, not yet. Hey, Elsa, how's this? Oh yeah, much better. He's trying to be more Scandinavian. Love the threads, Pike. What did he just say? He said his aunt is a moose exterminator. Hey, how's it going, Pike? Great, but Lisa's been worried sick about you. Really? Where is she? She's over by the punch bowl. By the way, we got that thing that killed Don. Really? How? What? I'll tell you later. By the way, love the horns. Thanks. Excuse me, Elsa. So glad you're okay. I'm fine. Where were you? Out with the sheriff. With all those guns?

Annie, what are you barking out? Oh my god. That's right, Sheriff. Saw it not 10 minutes. Big as a house. Walking along Thompson's gully as though it were God's natural order. Shirley, are you sure you ain't been hitting your brother's shine again? Sheriff, I know a pink elephant from a giant lizard and a lizard's what I saw. I'm sure of it. All right, Shirley, all right. Thanks for letting me know. I will check on it. Well you'd better. Stop that barking, Annie. Hey, mom. Look at her, Chase. She's never been happier. I'll say. Ride, honey. Ride like the wind. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I swear, Chase, sometimes I can't tell where horse stops and girl begins. It's a miracle. It certainly is. Thank you, son. Without you, she'd never would've had this dream come true. It's nothing, ma. I'm just glad I could make it happen. Listen, say goodbye for me, will ya? If I'm late for work again, old man Compton's gonna put me back on unemployment. You get along to work then. I'll say your goodbye for ya. She'll understand. Thanks, ma. Sheriff, I was just looking for you. Well you found me. What's up? Well I wanna know what you found out about the strange happenings around town. I'm investigating. That's it? Mayor, the voters of this town elected you to serve them. Right now every one of them is in mortal danger. If it strikes again, who knows how many people are gonna get killed. What exactly are you talking about? Let me escort you out to two gun wash. My god, Sheriff, it's huge. I had a feeling it was using this wash to move around unseen. This wash connects up directly with the quarry. We've gotta kill it. You've gotta kill it right now. Mayor, it's gonna take more than this revolver to do that. Well, what do we need? The National Guard? The Army? That'd be nice to have 'em, but it'll take a trick to get 'em. I say we go back to Compton's garage. Compton's? Yeah. You need an Army, he's got an Army. Mayor. Winstead. Sheriff. Chase, is Sherwood around? I'm around wondering why half the town bigwigs are in my garage. What's going on, Sheriff? Well that giant helo monster we thought we buried in the cave is now headed straight for town. Giant helo monster? It's real, Sherwood. We just saw it. Damn thing must be 60 feet long. Sherwood, we need your guns. Nitro hand grenades. Anything you got, we need it. Just a minute, Parker. Give me a minute. All right, I'm deputizing anybody in here who can pull a trigger. Even women? Yeah, even women. Well I'm game. Me too. What else do I got to do today. I will join you. I will, too. Let's go lizard hunting. Think we'll find it? More than likely. Thanks for the lift. You know how to use that thing, Mayor? I was with the big red one at Normandy. So was I. Yeah? Someday let's talk, okay, Sherwood? All right. Sounds good. Is that right? You got it, Sarge. Chase, man, where did it come from? Hell if I know. Why is it here? Never know. All I know it's headed towards town. Our town. We're gonna stop it. Here he comes. Next time somebody tells me pigs can fly, damn I'm gonna believe 'em. Aim for the head and the neck. Fire. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. And don't you think about coming back. What was that, mama? Did you hear that? I don't know, honey. Sounded like gunshots. Oh, it's probably just a car back firing. We did it, man. But Chase, it's headed right towards your family's farm. Mom. Hold it, Chase. It's gonna take more artillery than we've got. What about that nitro? Okay, get it. I'm gonna warn your mother. Rick, get over to the Stevens farm. You call the Winsteads. Tell 'em this thing's on its way. You got that? Halfway there, Sheriff. Lisa, this isn't your problem. They're my family, too. Then hold on tight, babe. This is the race of my life. Good luck, son. Come on. Come on, pick it up. Hold on to these carefully or- - Or what? Boom. Mama, what's that? We have to get back in the house. Get back in the house. Chase. Mom. Oh my god, Chase. We gotta get out of here right now. We gotta get her in the house. This thing will lift down the house. I've seen it. Come on, get to the family car. Come on. Lisa, you drive. Okay. Keys are under the visor. Mom, get the door. I got it. All right, sweetie, sweetie. Watch your head, sweetie. Watch your head. There you go. There you go. It won't start. Oh come on, try it again. I'm trying. Here it comes. Hey, Winstead, you need a ride? Yeah, Waco. Could use one. Thanks, Waco. Don't mention it. Take care of my girls. Yeah. Hey, Winstead. Don't die. Play time's over. There go my insurance rates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, huh, Chase? Yeah, I think this is the first ever Christmas slash destroy the monster party. Hopefully the last one, too. You got that right. Lisa, honey, I need some help with the Santa cookies. Coming, Mrs. Winstead. Hold on, handsome. Be right back with the sweets. As far as I'm concerned, they're already here. Mm. Flattery will definitely get you somewhere with me, honey. Winstead. Yes, Mayor. I expect you'll be rebuilding another one of those hot rods, won't you? I know you don't like 'em, Mr. Mayor, but probably. Sure. I see. Well, when you do. Yes, sir? You send the bill to me. Merry Christmas, son. The whole damn town owes you an incredible debt of gratitude including my daughter Betty. Yeah, how is she? Well because of you she's gonna be just fine. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Now Lisa, you take these out and serve them up while they're still warm, okay? Right away, Mrs. Winstead. And Sheriff, you save some room for dessert there. Oh, now Dorothy, don't you worry 'bout that. Carla, I'm so glad you could make it. I am, too. Where's Bob? He sends his regrets, but said I should come by anyway. Well I'm really happy to see you. Please grab a drink and feel free to mingle. Thank you. Where should I hang this? The closet's over by the front door, but just give it to me. I can do it. It's all right, I got it. Bye, Bob. Happy New Year. Here you go, doll. Some sweets for the sweet. Oh thanks, hun, but it's gonna have to wait. What's with the guitar?
