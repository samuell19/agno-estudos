Edited and Re-Synced by H@w-to-kiLL. Rhea, I can smell that all the way down here in the kitchen! Sorry! You know, melting plastic is toxic. Are you trying to kill us? You're out of cerulean in the workshop. We've got a ton of cobalt. You can't just arbitrarily switch shades of blue in the middle of a painting. It's like switching men in the middle of... Mom, thank you. I will remind John. Oh, it's finished. This morning. Oh, it's fabulous. Took 200 bags. You're a vision in recycled plastic. - Grandma! - Oh! - Oh, hi! - Hey. You're up early, were you working in the garden? So soon is the time for plowing is proclaimed. Must make haste to plow in the season for plowing.

Hey, Taylor. Hey, baby. What's going on? What up, ho? Oh... hell, yes. - Do you like it? - Uh, yeah. Yo, can you make me pants out of Target bags? A nice bulls-eye on my butt? - I'll see what I can do. - Here. I stole it from Franky Fatpants. You're terrible. What? Everybody calls him that. I'm not eating stolen food. Dude, you have to eat something. A girl can't live off of trash alone. I'll eat when I'm done. Are you gonna help me or what? Sorry, I gotta go print out college apps at the library. Next time, I swear. Give that back to Frankie. Whatev... - Hey, Frankie! - What? You can have your sandwich back! Hey, trash lady! You're welcome. No, it's not actual owl. No, she totally said wings and the stomach. She did not, she was talking about... We're totally talking birds. Don't do it. - It's done. - It's not done. It's yet to be done. There's been no doing. Why do you care? Because if you do this, I'm gonna get my ass kicked. Why would you get your ass kicked? Pack mentality... I'm with you, you do something lame, I get branded. And? And though I'm loath to admit it, I'm the weaker of us two. And thus, I'm more likely to get my ass kicked, since nobody jumps a guy unless they know they're gonna dominate. Ergo, my ass is grass. Ergo? Er-frickin'-go. I'm sorry, man, it's done. I heard she's in some freaky lady cult or something. Look, you're not gonna change my mind. You're crazy. Okay, let's settle down. We've got a lot to get through today, so let's get started. I trust you've all brought your poems in and you're ready to read them? Like, out loud? Excellent, a volunteer. Do I have to? No, of course not. But you also don't have to pass the class. Oh! You gotta pass the class, man. The Big Game... No, no, no. I refuse, no, I pass. Okay, good try. Do I have any voluntary volunteers? Abort. Mr. Sands? Thank you, always a pleasure to hear from you. It's... it's untitled. The moonlight whispers your name. Speak up! The moonlight whispers your name. Rhea. The song of my soul. Your eyes crash on me sweet waves of light. First scent of spring, first ray of dawn. A sip from that fountain and I thirst no more. A smile from your lips and I search no more. The world shouts between us. But the moonlight whispers your name. Rhea. Song of my soul. Rhea. Hey... uh... I wrote that poem for you. No, really? Oh, Rhea, song of my bone. Oh, no. Look, Oliver, I'm a huge fan of forgiveness... so let's just chalk it up to a massive lapse in judgment... and go our separate ways, shall we? No, I'd rather not. You'd rather not? No, I... I like you. You like me. Hey, bitch! You coming? Yeah. Hi, sweetie. You ever gonna take that down? Yes... when I sell it. It's embarrassing. I did it when I was 12. Well, I'm the curator of this fine establishment... and I think it shows great talent. Love desires reproduction in birth and beauty. What does that mean? Love... makes you want to create or recreate something beautiful... It's like you making art. I think I need like remedial Play-Doh. Play-Doh for Dummies. Hey! What's with the mood? School sucks. This town sucks. The world sucks... everything sucks. Listen, there's lots of good people in this town. Everyone thinks I'm a freak. Well... your dad's a freak. Your mom's really freaky. So I think that makes you... Super freak. - Great. - Get used to it. Fly that freak flag. ♪ Cross the bridge to Memphis ♪ ♪ Lost in someone's city ♪ ♪ See me through this Bring me home again ♪ ♪ Kansas Play those songs again girls ♪ Hi. Hey... you got my blue? Mm-hm. So... how's school? - Fine. - Fine. Oh, God, gross. A millennia of female nudes, why is a male nude so shocking? Uh, because it's Dad. Yes, it is. So, what am I working on today? Before I gouge my eyes out. The Corner of the Virgin. I've been working on that for like a month. Can I be done? Thank God, Da Vinci never said that. Yeah, but it was his. I'm just copying it. You think technical proficiency comes from naively indulging personal expression? No, of course not, Sergeant Take the Joy Out of Art. Oh, give it another hour, then we'll tend to the equinox. Mom! I asked you not to do that when Rhea's in the house. I ran out of matches. I didn't... Rhea! Are you almost ready? We're now entering the dark half of the year. May the light of the sun illuminate our hearts. - Here you go. - Thanks, Mom. - Honey? - I won't say no. Oh, thank you. Niko's applying to college. Rhea, we've had this discussion. I'm re-opening the discussion. You stay here and learn our trade, our traditions. You can pass them on to the next generation. I can go to college and do that. The world can be seductive, Rhea. I want to go to art school. I think that's worth considering. We are the last keepers of this tradition... And I'm not prepared to let you throw that away. I just want to see what else there is. You know when I was young, I wanted experiences, adventures... so I left here to find it, and it was an awful time. I lost my way. We can't hide ourselves from the world forever. The reason we keep our practice a secret is because the world has shown... over and over again that it doesn't know how to be tolerant. News flash, people are jerks. So what? Don't make light of it. I forgot to tell everyone. Rhea's lighthouse painting sold today. That's random. Told you. Congratulations, sweetie. Who's the buyer? A nice, young man named Oliver. Here's the thing, you have these limited number of variables that determine the path your avatar takes. Oh, by the way, have you seen the film, "Avatar?" Great CGI. Oliver? Yeah. Hey, so, I have a new a... Academic thing, catch y'all later. What are you doing? I'm going to third period. No, what are you doing buying my crappy-ass painting? It's not crappy-ass. I'm serious. Yeah, so am I... it's beautiful. Well, I want it back. Excuse me? I want it back! Uh, well, I'm no art collector... but I'm pretty sure the 75 bucks I shelled out means it's mine. I'll give you 100 for it. I'm not looking to turn a profit. Whatever. This creepy stalking thing that you're doing, it needs to stop. Okay, fine. I'll bring it by after school. The old house on Clay Hill, right? Sorry. Ugh! What's in there, dark dirt? Goat feces. Helps nourish the soil. Feces? Couldn't you just say manure? Hey, Cleo. Hi, Marigold! Hey, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty... if you want to help something grow. Although, look at me, hands full of poop. Still no squashes. Hi. - Hello. - Hey. Oh, Oliver. I rang the bell, but no one answered. Something wrong with the painting? No, no, not at all, I'm a big fan of it. You can leave it by the door. I'm gonna go get some more goat... manure. This place is cool. Oh, these are awesome. Thank you. What, you made them? Yeah. Nice, what are they made out of? Lots of stuff. Glass bottles, little dog food cans. So, that's what you collect trash for. Yup. Oh, I just thought you hated litter. I do... and waste. Seems stupid to invest all this time and energy making something just to throw it away. The crazy thing is that you took trash and made it beautiful. I should get going. Bye, sir. Bye, Oliver. He's a nice guy. He's all right. You gonna help me with these squashes, or what? Yeah. Glad to see my girl's still not afraid of gettin' her hands dirty. Rhea! Oh! - What? - I saw Rhea. She was... she was lying in the street. And there was blood. Sweetheart, sweetheart, it's just a dream. Come on. No, no, it was a vision. There was fire. There was... there was other bodies. Your visions aren't always exact. It's probably just... just a dream. Just don't worry about it. I think Rhea may have found her gift. Are you sure? Yesterday, we were in the garden and she touched the dirt... where the plants were all parched. And today, I went out there... and they are healthy and fully ripe. I am talking serious squashes. Well, that's impossible, her gift is not with the elements. I think it might be. I have sight, my mother has the elements. She has to have healing. No two women can have the same gift at the same time. It's been that way for centuries. I'm just telling you what I saw. People, ugh... pigs. Disgusting. Ew. But... Are you just gonna leave me here? Like there was just vultures ripping after me... And I mean, they didn't do anything bad to my body. - Hey. - Hey! What happened to your glasses? Poetry incident. Dangerous stuff. My sentiments exactly. What are you doing after school? Um, I've gotta go work. My dad, he owns a tree removal company. I mean, I could get someone to cover me? Meet me in front after 8th? Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. What are you doing? Unbelievable, I... I get beat up, you get a date. It's a cruel universe. - Hi. - Hey. I don't usually go on mysterious car rides with strange women. You think I'm strange? Yeah. It's like, the best thing about you. Wow. I know. I used to dream about this place... before I ever saw it, I mean. I'd have this recurring dream that I was standing... looking out over the water. Suddenly this huge wave would come, like... five stories high. And I'd feel so overwhelmed. Wave was like this wall of water. Right before it was about to swallow me, I'd wake up. When I found it, it was like my soul wanted to know this place. So what was the wave? What? In your dream. I don't know. Something I'm afraid of, I guess. What are you afraid of? What if... If you had to pick one thing. Not getting out of this town, maybe? That and public recitation of poetry about me. Yeah, I mean who would do that? We should go. No, we shouldn't. ♪ Hello and from there Where else can we go ♪ ♪ Hello a song ♪ ♪ I'm expectin' now to play Along with this song ♪ ♪ You crook just a boy Sitting there with his book ♪ ♪ And a smile That began to turn ♪ ♪ Leaving you ♪ Oliver... ♪ Just the same As you always knew ♪ ♪ As for me I'm as changed As a girl can be ♪ You grind that pigment any harder, you're going to crack that bowl. Where is she? Give the kid a break, Abby. John thinks Rhea has the gift of the elements. He saw it with his own eyes. I have the elements. She's supposed to have healing. Doesn't make sense. It could. If she has the other two gifts... If she has all three... That means the prophecy is being fulfilled. It's happening. What our family's been waiting for, for centuries. It's happening. But what about my vision, Mom? If something happens to her, what, no prophecy? People go on destroying the world and my Rhea ends up... Rhea developing her gift and your vision are two different things. Right now, we need to tell her what's happening to her. No. No, she's too immature, she's not ready. That is deeply unfair, Abby. She is feeling a huge power inside herself. The least we can do is give her a head's up. No, Mom, please don't tell her. - Hi. - Where were you? Out. Hi. Why didn't you call? I left my phone in the car. What's the big deal? The big deal is that something could happen to you. Like what? I slip on a banana peel? What's gonna happen? That's not the point. What is the point? It's disrespectful! I mean, we were so worried about you. Do you get that? Do you? I'm sorry. Abby! Mom! I can't get the feet right. What are you drawing? Toes. No, you're not. You're never drawing what you're drawing. You're always drawing the part in relationship to the whole. What do you mean? See these feet? See how they make a circle? Hm? I kind of made an octagon. The figures are all facing in different directions... but they're still inside the same circle. Kind of like you, me and Mom. Hm. I can't believe I've been staring at that thing for over a month... And I didn't see the circle. So, why do you think you didn't see it? Well, I was drawing each person separately. I didn't see them as part of a whole picture. Uh-huh. So you didn't see how everything was connected. Right. So what are you made of? What am I made of? The rocks made of, the trees, the water. What is it all made of? What are you talking about? Basic science. What is everything made of? Matter? Yeah, but what's matter made out of? Atoms. And atoms are made of what? - Energy and vibrations? - Yes, precisely. So on some level, you and... and the world around you are the same thing. You are... you're not in nature. You are nature. Look at this water here. You think you could make a wave? Grandma. If you could make a wave... how would you do it? Come on. No, don't answer. Close your eyes. Think about it. I'd push the water with my hands. Did the water move? Of course not, sweetheart. So, you gonna tap that, or what? I'm most certainly not gonna tap that. He's kind of hot, though... in a 19th century, Jane Austin-y kind of way. You can use him to make Taylor jealous. I'm over Taylor. You're gonna choke. What? What? Hello? What up? What... What are you doing? I don't know, I... I thought I saw... I think I'm going crazy. You're saner than me. That's not saying much. Wait, what are... ew! You are full of an inexplicable madness. - Nah! - Nah! Come on. Okay, uh, important question. If you had powers, would you be a super hero or a super villain? Easy, super villain. What do you mean? That's not even a question. Super villain. Why is this scary for you? Come on. I've thought about this a lot and I'm passionate about it. Like I really, like thought through the question. Okay, so... I desperately I really want to be a super villain. Okay, fine. What would your super, evil villain power be? Oh, oh. I would like to see it do as many powers as possible. Like I have this video game that I, that I made where you can... you can have as many powers as... as you want. Whoa! Whoa! Don't push. Thanks for nearly killing me. - Oh, me? - Yep. That was fully your fault. How would you... I've been used to that. It's gonna be so cool. You don't have boards or levels. Suck it, sucker, punk-ass sucker! You're not even trying. - I'm just preoccupied. - With what? He's applying to graphic design programs. Ugh, I hate college applications. Writing essays about your most favoritest day... your hero, so lame. I mean, why can't they ask us real questions? Like what? Like what effect does virtual technology have on interpersonal human relationships? Something like that? - Good question. - Thanks, bro. Right off the top of the noggin. So uh, where did you apply for college? Uh, Brown, Dartmouth, Berkley, Columbia... Seriously, where did you apply? What? I'm smart, get over it. Sorry, I've gotta go to work. Can I come? Uh, yeah. So all of this gonna be firewood? Yeah, some of it. Most of them are sick or dead, or knocked over from the storm. What? Whoa. That's intense. It's a giant tree stump.

Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess I'm fine. Big baby. Shut up. Sorry. You're three hours late! I know. I lost track of time. It won't happen again. I know it won't, because you're grounded. Grounded? Are you kidding? I'm not 12. I want you here every day after school working with your grandmother. If that's being grounded, I've been grounded my entire life! You just need a break from each other. Let her work in the gallery for a while. She can sketch there. Mom, stay out of it. Abby, at least you'll know where she is. Do you know how you're like the best dad in the whole world? How much do you need? I need... You let me leave here in the afternoons. Do you remember the punishment Zeus devised for Prometheus? Dude who stole fire from the gods?

Keep going. More in, farther a little bit. - Down! - Now? Now. Good! Good? Yeah. Wait a second. What? I can't believe you pulled this off. It's incredible. Hey, what's wrong? I thought it would look better. Please don't tell me you want to take them back. No, no, they're just... They're not in the right place. I... I don't think I've got the energy to move them. I just need to think. The big one should be standing upright. Rhea... Rhea. How did you do that? I don't know, I... I was just trying to feel it, where it belonged. Do it again. Go on. I don't know what's happening to me. Whatever it is, it's amazing. You're amazing. Come here. I can't... Rhea? - Hey. - Hey. I brought some sketches for Rhea to work off of. - Oh. - She in the back? No, no, no, no, I sent her to pick up a book for me. Oh... okay. I'll wait. Where have you been? - I was at the gallery. - Don't lie to me! It's not what you think. So now you're sneaking around behind my back. Yes, but I want to show you what I've been working on. I don't even want to hear it. I don't even want to look at you when I'm this angry. No, please, please. I need you to see. You revealed every twist and turn. It's remarkable. This is the reproduction of birth of beauty. Right here. It seems the student is catching up with the master. Not surpassing? Don't get ahead of yourself. How did you move them? Each piece is placed perfectly. Must have been difficult. I've underestimated you. What's up with you guys? Are you kidding? Go ahead. This is where we keep the artifacts of our ancestors. How come you never showed me this place before? Well, we're showing you now. Who's that? Oh, that? That's... That's my great-great grandmother's great grandmother. Her daughter settled here, started a new life of art and beauty... - ...and magic. - What kind of magic? She could see the future. She predicted the cholera epidemic, the potato famine. World War I, and she wrote down her predictions. And a time will come when Earth will reject the ones who abused it. Then one will come forth through the floods and the droughts... through famine and wars. Communion between humanity and nature will be restored. She will be called Blessed... and she will be birthed from the one with three gifts. Oh, my God. You know her? I've seen her. That means... she has two of the gifts. The elements and vision. This was painted by my great grandmother. This was her vision of the blessed one. You didn't answer my question about the magic. Each of the women in our family has a gift. I have the gift of the elements, which means... I have the ability to... influence the weather, help the plants grow. Light a candle without a match. I have the gift of vision. And those of us who share this gift, we paint what we see. So we assumed you would have the third gift... Stop talking, stop. You've had these powers my entire life and you never told me about them? You knew what was happening to me, I... I thought I was losing my mind! You may, in the future, give an incredible gift to the world. Because what? You think I'm gonna give birth to some chosen one or whatever? But only if you have all three of the gifts. What if I don't want these gifts? Oh, Rhea. This is much larger than us. So what, my life's just written out, because some freak 100 years ago said so? No. Can I come in? Did you know, too? Yeah, I did. How could you not tell me? Because I wanted you to have a normal life... for as long as possible. I don't want this, Dad. Sweetie, it's okay, it's okay. Maybe you were given this gift so that you can help. I mean, look at this planet. Look what we're doing to ourselves. Every day, environmental disasters... floods, tsunamis, extreme climate change. Maybe your mom and grandma are right. This is the wave. The wave? What's the wave? I keep having this dream and there's... there's this huge wave and it... it's so big and overwhelming. The prophecy, what's happening to me, it's... it's all the wave. Maybe it's time you learned how to swim? Ow! Heal. May the power of healing work on my hand. I can't heal. Are you sure? My hand's sure. Honey, what did you do? - An experiment. - Oh, honey. I need to show you something. Okay. Think not ye self, the healer. The healing comes before ye and after ye. The injured will be healed by love in its infinity. I don't know what that means. Well, I think it means that... that healing comes from a place of love. I still don't get it. Okay, you, Rhea, are not the healer. It's the love that emanates from your soul that is the healer. So... I can't heal, because I'm not emanating love? I don't know. I guess that's for you to figure out. I wish we could stay here forever. Mm, well, we have to row home at some point. No, thank you, sir. What? Are you abducting me with your magical powers? Maybe. I never thought I'd be in love with a witch. I'm not a witch. No, I meant that... you do magic. No, it's not like that. It's like, there are spiritual laws in the same way there are physical laws. If you understand them, how they work together... you can kind of work with them. Do stuff, I mean... Like move around giant tree stumps? Yeah. Is there any chance you could teach me? I don't really think it's something you can teach. You just kind of have it. Basically, there's this thing on my porch. It's like a goblin-type thing and every time you walk by, it goes... and it freaks me out every time. My mom has these bowl of grapes and she cuts them up and cuts all the skin off and then you put your hands in it and you close your eyes, and it feels like human eyeballs. - Oh, nice. - Yeah, it's epic. Be there or be square. You gonna be there? You're a square. I'll catch you later on? Whoa! What are you supposed to be? A sweeping generalization. I don't get it. Whoa. You should have just written loser on your shirt. Hey, that's not cool! That's not cool. Where's your witchy girlfriend at? She out riding some other dude's broomstick? Maybe she'll use her evil powers to protect you. Hey! She's not evil. - Oh, she's a good witch. - Yeah, that's right! Oh, my God. You serious? Rhea Carver's a witch? That's awesome! Hey! Ooh! I knew she was a witch, she's so weird. Yeah, she's a freak. Ba-gock, ba-gock, ba-gock! Wait, oh, no! Hey! Hey. Is something wrong? No, no, it's nothing. Uh, Simon's having a Halloween party tonight after dinner. His mom made a haunted house and we're gonna watch Saws of Death III. You should come. As appealing as that sounds, I can't. We're doing a family night. Right, yeah, of course. No, we don't... we don't like do Halloween, it's just... We lay low, it's chill. Kinda nice. Okay. Do you want to come? I've... yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. - Trick or treat! - Happy Halloween. Thank you. So, Oliver, how'd you come to love our beautiful Rhea? Grandma! How could I not? Good answer. How about peeling some potatoes? Sure. Put the peels right in there. Rhea, would you like to help me set the table? Anybody want some more pie? - Uh, no. - You sure? No, I'm good, thanks. Oh, it's fascinating. I mean, he hated kowtowing to Caesar... But he had to, you know? You know he said... to the soldier when they finally came to execute him in Cicero? No. He said uh, there is nothing proper about what you're doing, soldier. But do try to kill me properly. She stole my line. You do that every single time. Uh... Abby? Someone's here. In the house? Outside. Son of a bitch. Oh, my God. - Witches! Burn in hell! - Mom! Look! - Cleo! - Rhea, no! Cleo! No, Rhea, don't, don't, don't. Why would they do this? Cleo! This is my fault. - How could it be your fault? - What? No, no, I was just trying to defend you, it just slipped out. What? What'd you do? What did you do? I said you were a witch. No... I didn't say it like that. Leave. - Rhea, I'm so sorry. - Get out! And where do you think you're going dressed like that? School. Rhea... I'm not hanging out in this house for the rest of my life. I'm sick of all this goddess-save-the-world bullshit. I don't want to move the earth or see things. I just want to go to school like a regular person. You're not going... I won't allow it.
