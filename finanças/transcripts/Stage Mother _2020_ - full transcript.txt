Well, there's no freshness date on bullshit. Whether you believe me or not, I'm sorry. But I was expecting a funeral, not a musical comedy. It's how he would have wanted it, but you wouldn't know that because you didn't know your son. Why are you here, Mrs Metcalf? Circulating like a vulture for whatever you can get? - What? - Talk to my lawyer. I'm sorry for your loss. (baby cries) - Whoa! - Oh, shit! Did I just roll over your foot? No, I'm fine. (cries) You're so delectable. I'd like to slather you in batter and pop you in the roaster. Yes, I would. Oh, my God! Are you Rickey's mom? From Texas? Maybelline Metcalf. I'm Sienna Ellison. Rickey and I were best friends. This is also Rickey. Oh. (Sienna) So, Nathan wouldn't even let you in? (Maybelline) He hates me. (Sienna) He hates everyone right now. Just go around! It's a baby. (coos) Is Rickey the baby's father? Oh, God, no. Definitely not. - Do you know who is? - Yeah. Like 90-something per cent. Listen, the guy left me for some girl he met in line for the new iPhone. So, like, when he was asleep, I took pictures of his little tiny dick and then I posted them on all of his chat rooms. He got a restraining order against me, but it was worth it. - Oh, my. - I know. It's like every break-up. All that oral sex, then it's like you're strangers. It must be hard raising a child on your own. Well, I would've never gotten pregnant if I knew Rickey was gonna OD cos Rickey was gonna help me raise the kid, you know. Fucker. Honey, you thought that drug-addicted drag queen across the hall would be the responsible parent? He had a lot of love. But you wouldn't know that, would you? Rickey used to write, Christmastimes. He told me his best friend was Sienna. But I thought, you know I saw all these pictures of him with his friends and I just assumed... - (laughs) - You know. You thought I was a drag queen? Well, yeah. I mean, San Francisco is a big melting pot, but... These shits are real. This whole nation is one big melting pot, but my town seems to be that big clump of white flour that just won't melt. (chuckles) Oh, my God. Rickey got his sense of humour from you. Listen, why don't you come to my place for dinner tonight? I'll invite Nathan. Blindside him. I can see why you and Rickey were such good friends. See how you feel after you eat my cooking. - Anything I can bring? - Low expectations. (Sienna chuckles) Are you sure there's nothing I can do? - (knocking at door) - Come in. What is she doing here? Don't be mad. She came all this way. Oh, I didn't realise you were such a busybody. I have nothing to say to her. OK, so just listen and stop being such a dick. OK, sorry. The chicken was totally overcooked. Oh, it's Cajun style. A little blackened around the edges is all. Well, dessert will be better. It's my specialty. Shall I serve it? - Yeah. - Yeah. (Sienna) So bitchy. - Let me help you. - No, no, no. You sit down. You're my guest. (sighs) I'm not here to fight with you, but I did know my son for most of his life. But you're right. I didn't know who he became when he moved here. I only knew the boy. You disowned him. No, I did not. This... My specialty. It's my own creation. I call it Banana Climax. Delicious. Mmm, yeah. It doesn't suck. Thank you. My secret ingredient is resentment. And a shit-ton of baby food. (speaks quietly to Rickey) I want you to know I never stopped loving my son. Would you let me see where he lived? Show me your home? Fine. What, now? It's now or never. Go. Well... here... we... are. Those are his things if you wanna scavenge through them. There's more in the closet. You're getting rid of all of it? - Donating to AIDS hospice. - You waste no time. (Nathan) Welcome to the real world, lady. I have to move out in a week. I can't afford this place on my own. Move where? I don't know. I lived here for two years. But Rickey lived here for eight, so the lease was in his name. And the landlord wants to jack the rent. I could fight it, but even if I did win, I can't afford it. You know what? Here. Here. They won't let me touch his bank accounts or the lease or the electric bill or the phone bill. Everything is in his name and I'm not next of kin. There's no will and we weren't married because he wouldn't marry me until you would be there. Didn't wanna get married without his mommy. That's what he said. That eventually you'd come around and... Here you are, just a few days too late. Oh, yeah. He never stopped loving you, either. Even when I begged him to. There you go. - What's that? - The lease, keys, inventory. Contracts. Rickey owned the bar. - The bar? - The club. The one we managed together. Pandora's Box. Oh, my Lord. My home. Everything I worked for, everything I own, all yours. That's what the lawyer said. Oh, my Lord. - I've inherited a gay bar. - Congratulations. - Well, I don't want it. - Well, you've got it! I got to get ready for work. Take me with you. I gotta see it. Have you ever been to a gay bar? There's always a first time.

You would have been... very moved. I'm gonna stay a little longer. Would you please put some money in the joint account? How much longer? I don't know. A few days. Five thousand. Maybe ten? Five thousand? Well, there's legal fees and... and other expenses and whatnot. (Jeb sighs) Well, I hope this doesn't become a habit. It's not gonna become a habit, Jeb. I'm only gonna bury my son the once. - Look, for... - (hangs up) (sighs) Please get this to your landlord. That should cover your rent for a couple of months. (sighs) I don't wanna take your money. It's Rickey's money. I got it from his bank. I won't see you homeless on my account. You expect me to be grateful for giving me back my own money? I've also decided to let the club stay open for two months as a trial. Trial for what? I can't in good conscience even speak to my husband about not selling the business if it's losing money. And think of it as Rickey's legacy. Rickey would want it to be successful. No, I'd rather sell the place than work for you. Think of us as business partners and consider Sienna. I can sleep on her sofa and take care of baby Rickey during the day. That would be amazing. I'd love that. What do you know about running a drag bar? I'm a Southern Baptist choir mistress. Different songs, same divas. Some of the same wigs, too. Just take the deal for the both of us. That is my bar! Rickey warned me about you, but he didn't do you justice. I'm gonna find out what you're after, you conniving bitch! I don't connive. I scheme. I'm a scheming bitch. (piano music) We'll nail it tonight. Should I tweet our followers that we have a new closing number? Twat away. Smell her. And did you get a load of that accent? And her name is Maybelline, for Christ's sake. I probably would like it better if it were L'Oréal. So is Mommie Dearest gonna be our new boss? She does own the place now. Any direction at this point would be nice. Uh, Momma Metcalf? Hey, I'm Dusty. Or Roger, if you prefer it, but I prefer Dusty. I was Rickey's drag mother. A drag mother shows a younger queen the ropes. Teaches her the rules of etiquette and helps bring out the queen from within. (drag queen) We're sorry for your loss. - I'm Eric. - (Maybelline) Hi, Eric. I heard you sing at his funeral. It was beautiful. Thank you. It really touched my heart. - I'm Joan. - You have a boy name? Just Joan. Nice to meet you, Joan. I'm Cherry. We all loved Rickey very much. Um, do we still have jobs? OK, look, I'm still in charge here. Think of Mrs Metcalf as a silent partner. Uh, good, cos I don't take orders from amateurs. You want direction, Dusty? I'll give you direction. Rehearse more. Pay me more. Your lip-synching sucks. You've gotten too lazy to move. And face the music, if you can hear the music t's not like you're packing them in these days. Oh, God! All right, now, look. I don't wanna speak ill of the dead. We all loved Rickey, but let's be honest. He had not been himself in a long time and his fans, our fans, did not wanna watch their star burn out. So, we are without a director, without a star. We have to put a whole new show together, so if you wanna keep this place going without him, you need to pull yourself together. If I'm not appreciated, after all these years... I quit. Dusty, wait. Everyone's upset. I understand what it is to be older. Older? This place was your baby's dream. His vision. Maybe it should die with him. After practice tomorrow, you can talk to us about your ideas, boss. (snores quietly) (hairdryer whirs) (coos) Hi. Hm, morning. I like that lipstick colour. You know what? I could get you any shade of lipstick with my discount. I know it's a little cliché, blonde bimbo selling cosmetics, but it's the only job I have right now. It's all commissions. Listen, I don't know how long you're staying for, but I was thinking 200 a week seems fair. You don't have to pay me. For rent. - For a sofa? - In this neighbourhood, I could get twice the amount for a loveseat. Oh. Morning, there. Take a look at this. Morning! Tequila. - Guys. - (Nathan clears throat) Mrs Metcalfe, what do you think you're doing? This is my idea for a new show. What, the Southern gospel drag choir? The trans-tabernacle? Hey, keep an open mind. Sex, drag and rock 'n' roll? (scoffs) Girl, please! What is this? Retro night? I want you all to sing. Like sing-sing? Really sing? I've heard y'all humming along to the music here. Believe me, I've made much more with much less. How did you know that Rickey had that same exact idea? I didn't. The sex part, is that gonna be real, too? Hm? (Maybelline) Listen to me. How many drag shows are there in San Francisco? We need to appeal to the masses, not just some men in the neighbourhood. What's wrong with the men in the neighbourhood? Millions of tourists come to San Francisco every year. We gotta give them something they won't see at home. Look, even if we go with your idea, and I'm not saying that we are, how do you propose we get these tourists in here, Ms Field of Dreams? Oh, I love that movie! I have a plan. I play piano. Now, that's what I'm talking about right there. (Joan) Can we share? (music on radio) Oh, my Lord, Sienna. Those pants are so tight, I can see the Promised Land. Camel toe is so chic right now. It smells delicious. (Maybelline) So, where's he taking you? I don't know. His name is Grayson and he's totally my type. Scruffy, rugged. What do you know about this man? I know he's got a dick and I haven't been laid in a year. You're planning to sleep with this guy on the first date. Hell, yeah. Isn't that how you got yourself into this predicament? Listen, you are not my mother, you're my babysitter. - I can have an opinion. - Not about my pussy. - (knocking at door) - Shit. One second! Hi. (laughter) Hey, ladies. Maybelline said to bring dessert so I come packing fudge. You waited your whole life to say that line? Pretty much. (chuckles) Hi! Mwah! Darlin'. I'm not saying the place he brought me wasn't lovely, but when I asked him where the bathroom was, he said, "Take a left at the glory hole. If you reach the sling, you've gone too far. Girl! (laughter) Glory hole? It's like a confession booth. - Yeah. - (laughter) I can't wait until I'm done with my transition. Then maybe I'll have better luck with the straight guys. Oh, honey, you don't need luck. You need patience. I need me some good weaning. Hey! (chuckles) - OK. - (laughter) Maybelline? You've been married for a while. That must feel good. Well, I guess. Well, I wanna be married. (Cherry) Aww! Well, bitch, stop going for the closet cases all the time. - (groans) - (Cherry chuckles) Oh, my God! This is gorgeous. Do you sew? Oh, you know, I did some fashion back in my more naive times. Well, honey, if you can sew, I need everything that I own let out.

But we're not junkies. People go to night clubs to lose themselves. You might see something you don't wanna see. I can handle a gay bar.

It's Rickey. I don't think you've seen that before. In his room. He was a teenager then. He was getting moody, throwing hissy fits with his daddy and... To cheer him up, I-I told him he could paint his room any colour he wanted and... And so I thought we'd paint the walls his favourite colour and with your permission, we could hang that photo on the wall, so... he would never miss a show. (sobs) - Can I help you? - Thank you. Yes. Um... I was wondering if you would be, uh, willing to spread the word about a terrific show at our club, Pandora's Box. It's quite unique. That's a drag bar, right? Well, we have gender illusionists. No, thanks. We're not interested. Oh. Well, could I give you some flyers? There's no soliciting. - Oh. - Thanks. OK. Thank you. Oh!

Hey, it's a business dinner. - This one's good, huh? - Oh, I don't think so. Not red. If it looks good on me, it could look good on you, huh? (laughter) (piano music playing) I like this music. You should hear it on vinyl. - Vinyl? You're old school. - (chuckles) Every Saturday, I go to this great vinyl record store in Haight-Ashbury and treat myself to a new treasure. You were one of the cool guys in high school, weren't you? And you were that beautiful girl too busy cheering the football team to notice me. Do you mind if we make a couple of quick stops on the way? - Hi, Joan. - Maybelline. I heard you were sick, so I brought you some soup from the Whole Foods. It cost a month's rent, so it must be good. Thank you. You... - You look like a drag queen. - (chuckles) May I come in for a minute? August is waiting outside. It won't take long. Sorry. The place is a mess. I'm an even bigger mess. Don't worry. Where I come from, people leave their old sofas on the porch. Joan, I'm worried about you. Maybe you don't think you have a problem, but from what I hear, Rickey thought he didn't have a problem, either. Rickey and I were a lot alike. We used to... (chuckles) ...blow sailors together back in the day. You can't shock me, Joan. Not anymore. Maybe I'll stop. It's just that it makes shit so much easier to handle. Tell me what's so hard. I don't know. I mean, I haven't had a relationship in six years. It's not for a lack of meeting people. It's just that the more that I hook up, the lonelier I feel. I don't wanna lose you, Joan. Not like we lost Rickey. Besides, you're much prettier when you're not using that stuff. Well, me and Rickey are Dusty's drag daughters. She's been sober forever. She was always trying to get me and Rickey to go to meetings with her. You two should have a girls' night out. Dusty's not really talking to any of us now. (sighs) No. That was Rickey's. Nathan wanted me to have it cos I was Rickey's sister. He called it the Maybelline. Can you give me everything you have in this apartment? - I mean, all the drugs. - Maybelline... Nobody intervened for my son. I'm intervening for you. Is that all of it? That's what I've got. (engine idles) (chatter) I would have. Would have what? Noticed you in high school. (chuckles) (August) I moved out here the day after graduation. I was a hippie. I came here for the free love. (chuckles) Only thing about me that didn't get old is my love for this place. The bay. The hills. The fighting spirit. My favourite city in the world. I always feel lucky to be here. Especially tonight. Are you sure you don't want me to take you home? No, I'm fine. - I'll wait for you. - No, no. But that was the most wonderful evening I've had in I can't remember when. Thank you. Night. I was wondering, if you don't mind, may I sit with you tonight? (Joan sighs) (bottles clink) Hi. Ooh, someone got lucky last night. Yeah. I got very lucky last night. (laughs) What is it, Cherry? I was turned down for surgery again. Oh, I'm sorry. How come? Cos I haven't told my wife. Is your wife... visually impaired? I haven't seen my wife in five or six years or so. Oh. I need a divorce. That's... That's just the simple way. She won't give you a divorce? I haven't asked. - She doesn't know. - You should tell her in person. You shouldn't let a dead marriage hold you back. I already hurt her so much. If I were her, I'd want to know. It might help her to see what you've been through. You think? If you like, I could go with you for moral support. Yeah. I shouldn't go alone. I'm still wearing her weave. (piano music) ♪ If I could, I would give you a world ♪ ♪ Where everyone knew you were magic, darling ♪ - (stops playing) - Don't stop.

(gasps) (coughing) - Hey! - Who the fuck are you? Don't fucking wave that thing at me. Oh, I don't wave. I aim. Why don't you turn around and leave the same way you came in? (shouts) Shut up! Let her go! Let her go! (Rickey cries) Now, when I say, you're gonna go out that door and never come back. And if I hear you so much as text Sienna, I'm going straight to the police to file charges and I'm going to your boss to tell her about your previous problems with the law. So, what? You're gonna fucking kill me? Over a couple slaps? No, I'd kill you because dropping a woman beater is on my bucket list! Now, get your ass out of here before I put another hole in it. (whispers) Jesus fuck! Frozen peas works best. Not too much pressure on the eye. Do you wanna go to the police? I already have one restraining order. I don't want another. They'd take his side anyway. How did you know he had a previous brush with the law? I didn't. Just guessed. Would you stay in here with me tonight? Sure. He said that he liked it rough. And I said OK. But I didn't like it. And then he got mad. (sobs) I'm such a mess. When a man says he likes it rough... kick him in the balls and see if it's true. (Sienna chuckles) (Rickey coos) Good morning. Good morning. How's my boy? How's my Rickey? Hey? (cash register rings) (woman) What can I get you? Please... Please sit down. Just for a minute. I'm Maybelline Metcalf. I work with your son, Eric. What do you want? I want you to come see our show, as a guest. Please, don't. I understand what you're going through. My son, Rickey... He did not turn out like I thought he would. Like I wanted. And when things got tough, I chose not to see him, for many years, because I wanted him to change. And I never did see him again. He died. And he left me that night club. And that's how I know your son. And Eric is a fine young man. You raised Eric to be sweet and kind and... He doesn't hurt anybody. I would give... anything to see my son again. Just once. I don't want you to feel that same way someday. What can I get you? Oh. How's the chicken club? - Very good. - OK. Thank you. Hey, May. Oh, hi. Good to see you again. Say, what do you think about free drinks for all the girls tonight? - There go your profits. - Oh, well. (chuckles) Listen, can you make sure all the mics are working tonight? Yeah. I'll triple-check, Maybelline. How y'all doing? (whispers) Um, jittery. I'm stone-cold sober. I'm just nervous. Well, aren't we lucky to care about something enough to be nervous about it? Channel those nerves and you'll be great. - OK? - OK. - See ya. - Bye. (Maybelline) Bye. (music starts) (cheering) (laughter) (cheering) In here, Jeb. What the hell is going on here, Maybelline? This was Rickey's club. Yeah, so I gather. Who'd you talk to? A lawyer. Certainly not you. Well, it's been overwhelming. We inherited a gay bar. You forgot to tell me? I didn't think you'd be interested. I'm interested in selling it and going home with my wife. (Maybelline) The show's just opened. It's too soon to tell whether tonight's full house will translate into more full houses. I can't leave now, not when it's just turning a profit. (Jeb) It's been weeks. Our house is empty. Dead quiet. Well, play some Johnny Cash. (snorts) I love you. OK. I'll come back with you on one condition. We givethis place to Nathan, our son-in-law. Don't call him our son-in-law. No! That's my condition. Maybelline, this place is worth something to us. Thousands in stuff we can sell off. This is significant. It's not ours, Jeb. Rickey wouldn't want us to have this place. You don't deserve this place. Wedon't deserve this place. (Jeb) I have to get back at work tomorrow. (Maybelline) I need more time here, Jeb. You're pushing it. Sienna has to find day care. The show needs a new director. Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. What are you doing with these people? I'll send your sister up to help you. Maybe she can talk some sense into you. This is very kind of you to go pick up my sister. So, uh... if Bevette doesn't see me, what does she look like? Just look for the woman with a pained expression on her face as if life isn't worth living. That's her? No. That'll be the woman who sat next to her on the plane. She can point her out to you.

She's still carrying on with Jake the Snake Riordan. - Oh. - And him not even divorced yet. Imogene. Who would have thought it? Butter wouldn't melt. She tried to buy his kids' love with all them Harry Potter books. - Hm? - Didn't work. They'd already seen the movies. My friend, Cherry Poppins, has a joke in her act where she bends over and she says, "Oops! I hope you didn't see my Harry Potter!"

The girls are making money. I swear I even saw Nathan smile once. Word is you put on a good drag show. Not me. The girls put on the drag show. I just taught 'em three-part harmony. Please. Those three couldn't stuff a bra with socks. Actually, I've seen 'em do that. Oh, well, then I suppose it's good that I walked away and allowed them to blossom. They need their mother back, Dusty. But they have you. - I could never take your place. - Hmm. All they ever talk about is you. "Oh, these curtains are so Dusty. Oh, these glasses are so Dusty." (chuckles) They miss their stage mother. I'm going back to Texas, to church, to Jeb. That's my world. Come back to yours. Are you sure about this? Maybelline, shake a leg. I don't wanna be driving through the Tenderloin in the dark. I'm sorry about her. Every family has a relative who stabbed Grandma with a butter knife. Or dynamited a perfectly good barn. (sighs) (singsong) There is Nanny. Look! - Baby Rickey! - Yes. Oh, you are so light, aren't you? Hi, Dusty. Hey. It's Auntie Dusty. (chuckles) (Dusty) How are you? Yes, it's pretty over there. Take a look. It's magic. (Maybelline) Oh! Bye! What are we gonna do without our mamma? I'm gonna miss y'all so much. Hm. You're gonna make my mascara run. Oh, stop. No one wants you to go, Maybelline. Well, this ain't my life. It was Rickey's and yours. I think it's for the best. A little going-away present. Rickey used to get me to tape his performances, so he could watch them back and get better. Now you can see how he was. - Oh. - Dramatic and beautiful. Messy. - Just like you. - Oh! - Oh, thank you so much. - (screaming) - Oh, my! - What? I just saw the general and two colonels. For the first time, apparently. First time in the ladies' room. Cherry, this is my sister, Bevette. Right. I thought she was one of the new drag queens. Bevette... Mwah. This is my darlin' friend, Cherry. Oh, the one with the "Harry Potter". Well, it ain't that Harry. (laughter) Bevette, why don't you wait outside in the lobby? I'll just be a minute. Nathan, I've got a going-away present for you, too. This is all yours now. The club. - You're the sole owner. - (gasps) What about your husband? Well, that was my condition for going back to Texas.

I was watching that. Watching all that's not gonna bring him back. I know how much you miss him. Missed him myself for 20 years. (Maybelline) That was your choice. He was always the same, even when he was a little boy. You just didn't wanna see it. Bevette and me are your family now. We're gonna have to be enough for each other. Takes more than a ring to be a family, Jeb. Takes guts. You're still ashamed of your own son. - Even now. - He was a mamma's boy. Hiding behind your skirts and you let him! You didn't have the guts to love your own son cos you were afraid what other people would think. Well, let me tell you somethin', Jeb. You can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit! I never understood him. You loved him enough for both of us. Turned out just like you. Thank you. I was afraid, too, Jeb. Of you, him. Everyone. God. But I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not lookin' at our son through your frightened eyes. Our boy was a star. That's what he got from me. (door opens and closes) Oh, hell, Maybelline. You were a lot happier up there. Even I could see that. (sighs) Here. A couple of thousand to help see you through. - (chuckles) - Oh, Bevette! (music playing) Hi. Hey. May. What are you doing here? This is the only record store in the neighbourhood and it's a Saturday, so... I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything about myself. So... how are you? You look great. Thanks. I'm good. I'm back in town. But everything's up in the air for me right now. Well... I'm not afraid of heights. So... What are you doing tonight? Funny you should ask. (cheering) OK. All right. Settle down, queens! You look gorgeous tonight, girl. Did you get all dressed up for us or is this for a man? These days, all my men are wearing diapers and dresses. That's all I need. All right, bitches, get dressed! Oh, my God! You are a genius! (chuckles) You ready, honey? (sighs) I don't know. Oh! One ain't gonna kill ya. (applause and cheering) Tonight, making her Pandora's Box debut is my partner. - I call her Mom. - (audience) Aww! She's someone with a real name that a drag queen would kill for singing a tribute to our beloved Rickey Peedia. Ms Maybelline Metcalf!
