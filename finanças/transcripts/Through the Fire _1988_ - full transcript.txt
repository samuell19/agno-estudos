(tense music) (guard speaking foreign language) - [Peter] It came as no surprise. When you print Bibles for the underground church in Russia, you stand ready for such moments but I never thought it would happen so quickly. In a single minute, I became an orphan. (group singing in foreign language) (bell chiming) (woman speaking foreign language) (gentle music) Most of us at the camp in Podolsk were sons of political prisoners, but they treated us as hardened criminals and many learned to behave like animals. I would have been broken if God had not sustained me. I heard the stories every Russian hears of the few men who escape from the Soviet Union on foot. 1000 kilometers or more for the taste of freedom they walked, if they were not shot first. For months I planned my escape. Food, maps, camping gear. Every detail had to be accounted for. (group singing in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (smooth synth music) - [Peter] Walking the streets of Moscow, I am amazed I have gotten this far. When would I wake up from this dream and be found by the secret police? I learned later my best friend Sergei had been influenced by my escape, but he would soon wake quickly from his dream. (man speaking foreign language) (smooth synth music) (Peter sighs) (birds chirping) (moves into tense music) (moves into energetic synth music) (guards speaking foreign language) (dog barking) (siren wailing) (guards shouting in foreign language) (guns firing) (guards shouting in foreign language) (guns firing) (mine exploding) (mines exploding) (ominous music) (mine exploding) I was now in Finland. But Finland has an agreement with Russia to capture and deport those who escape. It would be another 300 kilometers before my freedom was assured. The American embassy secure permission for me to immigrate to the United States. They help me get into contact with a Christian mission who sponsor my trip to America. - [Man] Boy, is she old. Her social security number is two. (audience laughs) - [Peter] In America, I learned once you are well-known, you must hold a press conference. I kept telling myself, this is not as bad as a firing squad, no? (voices drown each other out) - Peter, what'll you tell us about America? - There I can worship God and not be put in prison. - Peter, have you had any American food yet? - Yes, Coca-Cola and fried chicken. - [Woman] What is your favorite thing going to be now that you're in America, Peter? - To play football and make friends and go to church. - [Man] Where's Peter staying now? - He's staying at a hotel until we make final arrangements with a host family. - What hotel is that? - Which one is it? - One of the hotels in Chicago. - [Woman] Where did you learn your English, Peter? - In Russia when I was 12 years old. - [Man] Peter, how did you get out of Russia? (speaking foreign language) - Only by God's grace do I overshadow. - Escaped, you escaped. - Yes, I escape. - [Man] The Russians are planning on taking over the world, aren't they? - What can we do to reduce the threat of nuclear war? - And what exactly did you come here to do? (speaking foreign language) - Only by fear of God can we reduce fear of war. - [Man] Peter, where are your parents? - His parents are in prison now because of operating a secret printing press. - [Man] What were they printing? - Bibles. - [Man] Weren't they afraid of their lives? - Well, let's. - [Man] No, Peter, one more question. - No more questions. (voices drown each other out) - For this young man from Russia, at least for the time being, it seems he has truly found the American dream. Now, whether or not this is a dream that we can swallow is another story. This is Samantha Newport, Eyewitness News Six, Chicago. - [Man] Oranges, June. - [Dean] Hello, I'm home. - [Man] Glory be. - Hi, honey. - [Marilyn] Oh, hi. - [Dean] Hey, I got that contract sewn up today. - [Marilyn] Oh, great. By the way, David's teacher called again. - Has he started turning in his homework yet? - No, he's been falling asleep in class. - Maybe we should take the TV out of his room. - I don't know, his counselor says that he could really use a pony. - Yeah, last week the counselor had him throwing clay against the wall. Can you tell me what good that's gonna do him? - [Woman] I don't know, I'm just thankful that he's a Christian. - Yeah, well. Hey, you'll never guess what happened today. You know how we've been praying to really do something for the Lord? Well, Pastor called and he wants us to take in that Russian boy, that one that's been in the news. - Oh no. - What? - A Russian. (screams) - He thinks we'd be the ideal family. Anyway, he said we could pick him up tomorrow downtown at the Hotel Continental and have him come and stay for a week or so, you know, kind of on approval. We've been really praying for something to help David. - I know, but you know what Doris Fox is going to say. - How many times have I told you not to worry about what Doris Fox says? - Oh, it's going to be so inconvenient. - Be a lot easier than taking in a pony. (gentle synth music) - [Bear] Whee, it's me. (laughs) Snuggle Fabric Softener Sheets. I can always cuddle the best, and they're never ever staticky. - [Announcer] Snuggle Dryer Sheets. Snuggly slumber that's rare. (music drowns out voices) - [Man] What'd you pay for it? - [Man] Well, 500. - [Woman] Are you kidding? - [Man] Does it run on batteries? - What's it made of? (laughing) Crazy pots? - [Man] Does it have a motor, does it have a motor? - In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Man] I see you are getting fat already. Don't get any illusions about America. The honeymoon is ending sooner than you think. (steady tone droning) - [Man] Disappear. - [Deirdra] Mommy, is he gonna hurt us? - Peter, hello, we're the McBrides. This is my wife, Marilyn, my daughter, Deirdra, I'm Dean. And this is my son, David. - Men don't hug in America. - The bourgeoisie live? - Just average Americans, Peter. - [Deirdra] Let me help, Daddy, let me help. - What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a Christian bumper sticker before? (upbeat synth music) - David, I was hoping you and Peter could share a room together. I'm sure you'd have a wonderful time. Well, just show him your room. - Ever hear of Transformers? - No. - And you're from Russia? Man. - What are Transformers? - It's like this watch, transforms from a robot to a radio. Okay, we're gonna flip to see who sleeps where. - Flip? - See, flip, coin. Look, George Washington and there's some bird, I don't know what it is. You can have George Washington. - [Peter] Yes, George Washington. - Your choice. If you're down here, you can change the TV channels faster. If you're up there, Deirdra won't attack you in the morning. - You choose. - I'll take the top. (overlapping voices speaking on TV) - Morning. - Good morning, Peter. - Morning. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, bed was very soft. Boy, this is like big dinner back in Russia. - Oh, were there just you and your mother and father back there? - No, I had little brother, Yuri, but he was taken to orphanage after my parents were arrested. - [Marilyn] Oh. - [Deirdra] Mommy, is Peter ever gonna wear American clothes? - [Woman] What do you think, Bree, a robot ship? - [Man] Probably. Shoot it down, beta leader, engage and destroy. - Back in Russia we used to get up at four o'clock every morning to stand in line for bread. - [Marilyn] Oh. - Mommy, I can't eat any more. - That's okay, dear, just put it in the disposal. - [Dean] Honey, I gotta go. You have a good day. - Give me a kiss. - Bye bye. - [David] Bye, Mom. - [Marilyn] Bye. - [Man] Bruce Banner's rage and his frustration finally trigger the powerful gamma rays in his body, causing the world's most fantastic transformation as the-- - Mrs. Davis? - Yes, Elliot? (snorting) - How can you tell so much about those guys, their hair and ears and everything? All we have are the skulls. - I mean, Elliot, if they're that old, they'd have to be covered with hair, don't you think? - Maybe you need some help, Ms. Davis. (laughing) - Oh, may I help you? - I'm Peter Petrovich Smyslov. I am your class. (laughing) - Now, Petrovich, I don't think you're on my computer printout. Now, are you on vacation from Russia or something? - Vacation? - Yeah. - She wants to know whether you're on a holiday. - [Boy] Santa Cruz, Ms. Davis. (laughing) - No, I escape from Russia because of religious persecution. I am Christian. - [Boy] All right. - You came here to find religious freedom? Do you have any transcripts or records or? - Yes, I like very much music. - Hey dude, you got any U2 albums? (laughing) - Thank you, Al. Okay, you can sit down 'til we sort this thing out but first let me give you your resource manual, supplementary text, book of insights and answers. You're gonna have to buy a spiral notebook, two sets of index cards, a set of markers and a box of crayons, but for right now, just take a seat right back there, okay? - Yes. (laughing) - You got a Bible here, man. Now, you wouldn't be trying to advertise a little religion, would ya? - That's two back on the eighth. - [Girl] For sure, thanks. - May I help you? - Yes, can you help me find books about science and the Bible? - If we have anything it would be over there in the card catalog. - Huh? (sighs) - You don't know what a card catalog is, do you? Okay, you have these drawers of little cards, author, title, and subject cards, but you don't know the title so you look in the subject cards, get the Dewey Decimal number and go find the book. - Huh? - (sighs) You're gonna need to understand English before you can do anything. - You'll teach me? - Here's something that I think will help you. See, these teach you vocabulary and how to pronounce words. They're really good and they're simple, sit down. Now, all you have to do is listen and then repeat. - [Man] Alfredo likes spaghetti, but Jill likes hamburgers. - Can you say that? - Alfredo likes spaghetti, but Jill likes hamburgers. - Okay, good. Now this is play, stop and eject. - [Peter] Play, stop, eject. - Right. Oh, hi, Don. - [Man] Lewis likes to wash the car but Barb likes to go shopping. - Sheri, what're you doing with this guy? - I was just helping him find a language tape. I kinda feel sorry for him, poor guy. - You feel sorry for that guy, the poor guy? That guy is totally weird. - Teacher? - Shut up. (whistle blows) - [Peter] Some new friends noticed how much I like soccer and they said they would help me get on the high school team. It was like the time my friends smuggled me into a sold-out performance of the Moscow Circus. - Angelo, what do we got here? - Huh? - What do you think you're doing? - Well, you might say he's like a Trojan horse. - Now, come on, just blend in. Pretend you're part of the team. - Hey, Murray, what do you got over here? - Just a Russian, Coach. - A what? - This is Peter, the new kid from Russia. I think he's a good soccer boy. - Yeah, soccer's a pretty big sport in Russia, Coach. - Yeah, come on, Coach, isn't that just what we need? Talent? - You're dead, man. - [Coach] Bresler. - How do you do? - Don't try to con me, Murray. I wouldn't put it past you to bring a spy over here from Central High to steal our training secrets. - What secrets, Coach? Sorry, Coach. We got enough losers as it is now, and the district rules say you can't play a kid until he's been here for six months. - Coach, Coach, Coach. - [Coach] Bresler, 10 laps. - [Don] You're dead. - Go get dressed. I think he can make it on his own, Elliot. All right, Cooley, let's get with it here. Marshall, move that fat. Hey kid, you wouldn't wanna be an equipment manager, would you? You know, clean up, take care of the equipment? - [Peter] Yes, I should like. - Are you working on your Sunday school lesson, David? - Huh? - I said are you working on your Sunday school lesson? - [David] Oh, yeah, yeah. - In Russia we have secret Christians but you are secret unbeliever. - Honey, you're not gonna like this. - [Marilyn] What? - I forgot our money for the collection plate again. - All I got is a quarter. - [Marilyn] I've only got a dollar. - A dollar 25 isn't good enough for Mrs. Fox, Mom. (beeping) See that? That's how you get money in America. - Really? Why, such a machine is amazing. - We've got over 2000 people in this church, Peter. I bet you don't see anything like this in Russia. - [Peter] No, do they photograph here? Is there police? - [Dean] (scoffs) No, not here. ♪ Homeland ♪ ♪ And we shall be holy ♪ (upbeat electronic music) ♪ And shall ♪ - By the way, what is this I hear about your taking in a delinquent? (Marilyn clears throat) - Not really. - But he is from Russia. - Well, he is, but he's not actually a-- - Well, you're just going to have to put on the full armor of God. - I can't stand that Mrs. Fox. She always says she's praying for me. - Well, I'll be praying for David. - Thank you, we'll need it. - Peter, Peter, I want you to meet someone. This is Senator Tom Brewer. He's a very important man. Hey, he's been working on some US Soviet trade agreements. - Peter, I visited Russia recently and I'm so glad to find out that there's no more religious persecution in your country. - But thousands like my parents are in prison for their Christian beliefs. - He's young, Senator. I'm sure he wasn't disagreeing with you. - Nice meeting you, Peter, and if there's anything that I can do for you, please let me know. - Peter, this is Jack Wayne and his wife, Betty, and their son, Lee. Jack is head of Win-McCabe Law Firm. He's a very important man. - Pleased to meet you. - Peter, I just gave $50 to Bibles for Russia. Hey, Mill, congratulations on your promotion. (gentle synth music) - Boy, there are a lot of important people here. (moves into smooth synth music) Rondo buys eggs. - [Sheri] You're getting there, Peter. - Hi, I don't understand. Today he goes, but yesterday he doesn't goed, he went. - That's the English language for you. It's kind of crazy. - Real crazy. - Well, I got some books for you. Now you'll be able to come up with some really good ideas in class. And this is for when you don't understand some words. - Thank you. - I have to go now. (moves into bright piano music) (students chattering faintly) - Angie, don't tell me this guy's playing for our team. - Oh, him, no, he's just the equipment manager. Cleans up and everything. - Did you tell him what happened to the last equipment manager we had? You like cleaning up mud, don't you, Bible boy? Well, here, man, here. Here, clean up some more, man. - All right, man. - You want some more? Oh, that doesn't do it, man? How 'bout the Bible? How about the Bible? Come here. What'd you do, man, if I dunked it in here? What would you do, huh? - Come, on, Don, leave him alone. - Take your Bible, boy. Man, I was just baptizing him. (mumbling) - Hey, you. (overlapping voices speaking) - Get off him, man. - Come on. - All right, you guys, move it. I wanna go home. Peter, don't let these guys push you around. I never told you you had to clean the floor. Go get the rest of the equipment off the field. - Man, your attitude stinks. (gentle music) - But as soon as the people had been put out, Jesus went into the girl's room and took hold of her hand, and she got up. Hey, just between you and me, do you really believe in this stuff or are you just trying to believe in it because Mom and Dad do? - I believe it. - Hey, how would you like to hear something really interesting? - Okay. - Okay, there was this real ugly monster who had real ugly slime all over him and at night he'd come and visit this little girl and sleep at the foot of her bed. (screams) - Is everything okay? - Yes. - David, I want you to read it slowly enough so that Deirdra can understand it. - Okay, Mom. Jesus went into the girl's room and, one night he came in through the windowsill and he got slime all over it and it must have been a Russian because the slime was all red. - [Marilyn] David. - Yeah? - [Marilyn] Was he really reading that to her? - No. - How about this one? It's got one of those computerized things that tells you how many calories you're burning off. - Sure, why not? Can't believe David, he used to be so fired up for the Lord. - Yeah, I know. - Now all he thinks about is listening to his stereo and hanging around with all of his friends. - What friends? - Do you wanna contribute to Missionaries International? - Never heard of them, what do they do? - Starving children, I think. - Sure, give them 20 bucks. - Maybe we shouldn't have made such a big deal about those haircuts. They're getting him into counseling so soon. - I think what he needs is more discipline. - What about this Christian seminar on midlife crisis? - I went to that last year with you. - Yeah, I know, but you're a year older, and look, the theme is the autumn years. - Let's wait 'til they air-condition the cabins. You know, if he's like this now, what's he gonna be like four years from now? I think we've gotta get tough while there's still time. - What about the pony, here's the estimate. 20% down and 36 easy monthly installments. - You know, I can't believe we're even considering getting this kid a pony. - Hey, do you really believe in that stuff or are you just trying to impress somebody? - The Bible? Yes, I believe.

In Russia I lost every friend for the name of Christ but I am an American now. I wonder if there was any place I could go where I would not have to drink from the cup of suffering. - [Girl] Come on, you guys. - Can I sit here? - Yeah. Welcome to the loser table, the social rejects of Kennedy High. - You like some? - That's Darlene, she doesn't say much. - Thank you. - That's the first time I've seen her smile. I've been trying to witness to her, invite her to the youth group. - You talk about Jesus at school? - I hand out tracks. I'm starting to get pretty discouraged, though. - Do you have many Christians here? - Yeah, but don't ask me how many. It's the best kept secret at Kennedy High. - Do you have any Christian friends? - I don't have any kind of friends. Sometimes I picture myself as Mr. Cool Dude though, you know? People yelling across the lunchroom, hey, Elliot, who's the girl you were with last weekend, huh? Hey, Elliot, nice Porsche you got Saturday. Hey, Elliot, nice touchdown you made. - [Boy] Hey, Elliot, you reject. (students laughing) - See what I mean? Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I gave up this Bible stuff and worked on my image a little. - Would you like to read the Bible? - You got a good lawyer? - Lawyer? - Yeah, they got laws against bringing God into school. - Laws against God? - You're used to that, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - 500 million years ago, we had the Cambrian age. We're talking about trilobites and invertebrates. 480 million years ago, we had the Ordovician age which is shell animals, and then 435 million years ago, we had the Silurian age. Yes, Peter. - I do not believe what you are saying is truth. (students murmur) - Peter, you're entitled to have your own opinion but you're up against facts backed by the entire scientific community. - I don't understand. You say the Earth is four and a half billion years old, but that's impossible. - Is it, Peter? Would you like to teach this class instead of me? - Yes, may I show? - Yeah. - All right. - Come on, get up. (students murmur and applaud) - [Mr. Engle] I don't have to take it from you either. - You take plenty, Mr. Engle. The children just walk all over you. A Russian conducting Bible classes in the lunchroom, creation science and genesis being discussed in class. I know my daughter didn't get these terms on her own. - [Mr. Engle] These kids do a lot of reading these days, Mrs. Nation. I don't know where they get all these terms from. - Oh, don't play with me, Engle. You almost lost your job last year when you put a Christmas tree in the front hallway. I want you to deal with this issue or I will. - I'll deal with it, Mrs. Nation. There's no need for you to worry. - Darlene. - What are all these people doing here? This looks like traffic court. - Frankie assaulted his English teacher. Jennie forgot her gym clothes. Gloris, Darlene and Karen were caught smoking in the girl's washroom. - Just give them passes back to class, and Grace, hold all my calls. I have a real problem to deal with. Peter, come on in here and close the door. - [Girl] Mm. - [Mr. Engle] Peter, do you know why you're in here today? - No. - There's been some concern about the way you've been expressing your religious beliefs at school and there's certain things that you just don't talk about in a public high school. - Yes, I learned that in Russia. - Your science teacher gave me this test. This isn't the kinda thing that's gonna get you through school, and neither is holding Bible sessions in the school lunchroom. You're gonna get in serious trouble, and I don't want that. Look, see this, American money. Key to the good life, and you see the guy's picture on it? Started out as the simple woodchopper and ended up to be 16th president of the United States. If you keep your nose clean and get a good education, you could do the same thing. - In God we trust. - Honey, I spoke with the pastor and one of the members of the Slavic Relief Fund today and they wanna know how things were working out with Peter. - Well, what did you tell them? - I told them everything was fine. - Well, is it? - I don't know, you're with him all day. ♪ You're on your way to the top ♪ ♪ And on the way you've always known ♪ ♪ Just who you are ♪ (knocking) (tense synth music) - [Peter] May I help you? - Yes, I'm afraid I have the wrong number. - For what are you looking? - 1618M. - This is 1640. - I'm sorry but you look very familiar, no? Perhaps we have met somewhere else. - I don't think so. - But you look very much like the boy who was in the news who escaped from Russia. Is your name Peter? - Yes. - My name is Bruno. I'm from the travel agency. Did I hear that you may be traveling back home soon? Here is my card. - No, I will be staying. Where did you hear that? - Oh, it happens sometimes, the home sickness. - I love it here. - Are you sure? Maybe you are trying to get yourself to believe that. - No, I will stay, everything is fine. - Have you found the freedom here that you are looking for? - If I return, they will only put me in prison. - But how can they inspire others to return to their homeland if they were to put you in prison? On the contrary, Peter, you would be a hero. You would have a free education, a car, a (speaking foreign language) when you get older, hmm? Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I will be able to take care of all your plans. (upbeat music) - Well, here we are. - Where? - The mall, this is where all the action is. - Action? - Yeah, this is cool. - What is cool? - Just cool, that's all, a lot going on up here. Stores and everything. A lot of my friends come up here. I might even see a girl I know, and don't start bringing up all of this religious stuff, okay? It'll be very embarrassing. Ooh, look at that Firebird. Hey, there's one of my girls now. - Really? - Yeah, one night I took her out and we started dancing. Then we went out to the movies. Real fun. What's wrong? - So you know Jodi, huh? - Yeah, right here. - Bet he got that out of a yearbook. - Let's see if he's telling the truth. Hey Jodi, come here. Yeah, right. (speaking faintly) This kid? - Yeah, I've seen him around. - Have you gone out with him? - Are you kidding? - Do you wanna go out with him? - Oh yeah, give me a break. - Hey, knew he was a liar. (overlapping voices speaking) What a liar, what a little wimp. He has to lie about everything. - You're such a schmuck. - Let's get out of here before we're seen with this loser. - Come on, let's go. - [Man] Well, I'll tell you what. Since Wally doesn't seem to ever been in the garage, I think he's prepared to try it. (melancholy music drowns out voices) - Sorry friends treat you mean. - They don't do nothing to me. - You want to give me English lesson, Davie? - Man, don't call me Davie. - You want to play soccer? Jesus give us nice day. - Quit preaching to me, okay? - [Man] Delicious roast here. - [Woman] Well, thank you, dear. - Don't you get tired of looking at box? - Never, hey, do me a favor and go back to Russia, all right? - [Man] He was chewing with his mouth open. (audience laughs) Good boy. - [Woman] Couldn't we have some pleasant statements at the supper table? - [Boy] Yes, Mom. - [Man] Yes, Mom. (audience laughs) - If we want results, there's going to be consequences. I need you to support me in this, all right? - [Peter] David reminded me of my little brother. They were both in prison, but David did not know that from his prison bars, he could be set free. I prayed for a way to reach him, and one day it came. - [Dean] David? - Yeah? - Your room. - What about it? - You need to clean it. - I did. - [Marilyn] David, you need to clean it until it's clean. - Man, you guys are doing this all because of Peter, aren't you? - David, you are not leaving this house until that room is clean. - Ground me, see if I care. I didn't go to that youth group anyway. - David. - Ha, I never really believed in that stuff anyways. - [Marilyn] What? - I was just faking it. - David, don't talk like that. - Why not, I mean it. (tense synth music) (banging) (upbeat synth music) Hey, that's pretty good. - You'll teach me basketball? - I can't play myself so how am I supposed to teach you? - Yes, that is a problem. - Hey, do you wanna teach me how to play soccer, like, really good? - You really want to be good? - Yeah, like in Russia. - It is a lot of hard work. I'm not so sure you want to work so hard. - Are you kidding, I love work. Come on, let's get going. (breathing heavily) How much longer before I can rest? - After four more laps, okay? - You've gotta be kidding. How about two? - No. - Three? Three and a half? (whimpers) - You've got to get another four seconds off your time. - But I thought you said you were gonna teach me how to play soccer. - You have to learn to run first. - I didn't know you had to suffer to be such a good soccer player. - You don't know what suffering is. Popular? - You know, like wearing the right clothes, doing a sport, earning some money to give your girlfriend a nice time. - Then I will have girlfriend? - Uh-huh, and you have to have a nice personality too, like smiling and saying the right things and laughing a lot. (laughs) - Then I will have the friends, right? - Yeah. - That's funny. - Yeah, it is, kind of. - You are a very beautiful girl. - That's my house, I have to go now. - Bye. - I want you to take Peter up to Sears and buy him some decent clothes. Here's my charge. I trust you to get him something nice, all right? - I will, Mom, you know I've got good taste. - Mm, just be back by five. - [Both] And look both ways when you cross the street. - I will, Mom. Let's go. - Where are we going? - Just leave it to me. - [Peter] Hey, what are you making? - Ah, I'm making my TV schedule. Can only watch three violent shows a week. An hour of homework for an hour of TV. Man, I'm not used to this kinda torture. Those are my girlfriends. - [Peter] You have girlfriends and you're only 12 years old? - Sure, I got lots of 'em, but my parents won't let me date. That's a real bummer. All my friends started dating in fourth grade. - Hey, she's not your girlfriend. - Hey, take it easy, I'm not going with her or anything. She's just a good friend of mine. What, are you going with her? - No go, she says she can only have one friend at a time. - Yeah, and I bet it's Don Bresler, right? - Yes. - Hey, I bet I can fix that. Tiger Beat, you've gotta be kidding. - I promise, Scout's honor. He's got a whole stack of 'em. - Okay, all you have to do is tell Sheri's sister and she'll tell Sheri, okay? - What are you willing to pay? - How much do you want? - 10. - I'll pay you five, max. - 8.50. - 3.50. - 6.50. - All right, here's $5.25. - Make it six. - Here's another quarter, 5.50 on the nose. - It's that Russian kid, isn't it? - Don, no it isn't. - Well then what is it, would you spell it out for me? - It's just these things I've been finding out about you. - Come on, babe, you know I can handle that. (sighs) - All right, okay, this is really embarrassing, but my little sister knows your little sister and she says you watch Bozo. - I just watch it for the cartoons, is that such a big deal? - She says you use her Mr. Bubble just about every other day. - I use it for shampoo, is that it? - She says you read Tiger Beat Magazine. - That's all right, all right? All right, that does it. (engine revving) - I probably oughta tell you, I don't really know a lot of them girls in that book. I just get 'em and trade it for gum cards, and trade 'em around to be cool. - Hey, that's okay. - And I wrote little comments on them to make them look more realistic. That's all fake, that's all. I don't really have any friends. - You forget about your best friend. - Jesus? When you ask Jesus into your heart and you do something really bad, will he accept you back in? - Do you know the story of the prodigal son? - I guess I do. - When he went away on a long trip, what happened? - He did the worst things a person can do, I guess. Spent all of his dad's money and stuff. - And when he returned, did his father lock the gate and say you can't come home? - No. - [Peter] Did he hide in the garage and make his son look for him? - No. - [Peter] What did he do? - He came out on the road and met him and kissed him. - [Peter] Won't God forgive us if he tells us to forgive 70 times seven? - Yeah. - [Peter] Even if you've seen the worst in anyone? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I'm sure. - Hi, Sheri. (laughs) Look. - Great, Peter, you look terrific. - I have been praying we can be friends now. - Well, let's just follow the Lord's timing about this, okay? - We cannot walk together or read the Bible? - Peter, it's just not that simple. If we do that, everybody will think we're going together. - Okay, let's go. - Look, Peter, your clothes, they're great, but-- - But what? - It's just that you're kind of new here, and, well, I guess we could be friends if we just didn't date or anything right now. - Then you're just imaginary friend. - I have to go now. - [Boy] I like your clothes, Petey. - [Boy] Hey. (bright music) (crowd cheering) - Wake up, goalie. - Go. - Come on. - Go, go, go. - Go, go. - Come on, Sheri. - Come on. - You don't get moving and you get 50 laps tomorrow. Let's go. (spectators drowning each other out) Aw man, ref, didn't you see that? - [Man] Go, fire out. - Can you believe the apathy on this team? Sunglasses again. (spectators drowning each other out) (groans) - You know, Elliot, he could save the game for us. - Yeah, let's ask Coach. - Let's ask Coach. Coach, can we borrow you for a second? - Yeah, we need to interrupt you 'cause we know you're concentrating on the game that we're losing. - And you know it's gonna hit the papers tomorrow that we lost. - Yeah, and then, you know, they'll cut the soccer program. - 'Cause we lose too much, Coach. - Yeah, and sure, you taught us to be good losers and everything. - We got an idea that we could win, Coach. - Give up. - Right, we got something here that could get us the win. - Just give me a break, guys. - Wait a minute, Coach, just listen to us, okay? - You know, I want this victory so bad, guys. Don't play it with me. - But there's a kid here, if you put him on the team he could give us the game. - Give him a break, let him try. - Come on, guys. - No, honest. - He's right here, Coach. Just wait here. - Wait here, we're gonna go and get him, okay? - Yeah. - Here he is, Coach. - Here who is? - Pete. - Pete. - Who? - Our Pete. He's played, he's brilliant, we've seen him play. - Yeah, but what could he do? Could he kick, could he run, could he pass? - He can do all that stuff, Coach. - Kick, run, pass, jump, you name it. - He's from Russia. - Hey, I don't care if he's from Cuba. He's a very controversial kid in this school. - Who cares if he's controversial? He can kick a ball, Coach. - Yeah. - You mean you want me to just put him out? - Yeah. - All right, get him suited up. We'll see what he can do. - All right, let's roll, move it. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) - It's a religious maniac and I got him in my game. What am I gonna do? (crowd cheering and applauding) - I thought you said you shouldn't let everyone in the school know you like me. - Well, I have a real peace about being with you, Peter. - Hey, I didn't know you were going with Peter. (Sheri laughs) - Hey, Pete, congratulations. Nice play on Saturday. - Thank you, I didn't do much. - Hey Pete, don't forget about that radio club interview tomorrow. - Okay. - Yeah, Pete, don't forget about the pizza job I got lined up for you this Sunday. 4.75 an hour, all right? - Okay. - Yeah. - Hey Pete, some kids wanna put you on a ballot for Homecoming King. - Sounds great. - I'll see you tonight, Pete. Give me a call after school, right? - Okay.

Stay right between the lines. That's all you've gotta do. - This isn't safe, Dean.

(tense music) - [Sheri] Peter, what are you doing? - Okay, partner, I'm taking off, okay? So just close up like you did last night, all right? - Okay. - All right, see you in school. - Catch you later, alligator. (speaking foreign language) - I did not hear from you, so I decided to pay you a visit. - I'm not going home. - I'm so sorry. I expected to hear something different from you. Aren't you worried that something may happen to your parents? And what about you, Peter? People like you are so vulnerable. Sometimes in the middle of the night, so unexpected, an accident. - How did you know I was here? - We are watching every move you make. - Peter, when you first arrived, we met a Peter Smyslov who expressed everything in terms of strong religious faith. What's happened to that? - [Peter] I still believe very strongly, but now I discovered that you can be Christian and you don't need to suffer. You can be, how you say, prosperous Christian. - Peter, what would you like to do when you're older? - I think I would like to be attorney like my host father. He makes comfortable wages which allows him to buy many things. - Go now, ye rich men. Weep and holler for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten. - [Peter] Each day I tried harder to be part of the American dream, but I wandered farther and farther from the truth. The man who was born in a manger and rode on a donkey seemed like a stranger to me now. How I wanted to be set free from the love of money and popularity and success that bound me more than any concentration camp. I would walk 10,000 kilometers to be free from this prison of deception, but God simply wanted me to give him my broken heart, and so I did. - What's the matter? You don't want to come over. - What's it say, Peter? - All right, I will translate. (sighs) Dear Peter, have you received our letters? I trust you are still close to Jesus as you have been since you were so little. Grandpa has lost his sight. They took away the Bible he copied for so many years. Who knows if he will ever start on another one. We are all getting weaker here at the camps. There are no shows and sometimes a single piece of bread we share. (sighs) But for Jesus we count the joy. Oh, how I'd love to cover you with a mother's kisses. (birds squawking) - Do you ever get homesick, Peter? - Many times I get homesick. Our church, the family worship together, my mother's gentle embrace, my little brother Yuri's laughing, but most of all it's going into the hills at night and praying just like Jesus. The trees rustle and no one listens but God, so close to him. Father, I thank you for this day and for the ability to play soccer and help us not just to play for ourselves but to please you. In Jesus' name, amen. - [All] Amen. - Let's go get 'em, guys. - Come on, Peter. - Hey dude, let's get them today. - Nice talk, Pete. - Skim, Pete. - Let me know. - It's fantastic, Pete. - Peter. Principal doesn't want you playing anymore until you see him. I'm sorry. - Bible studies in the lunch hall, praying at the soccer games, opposing traditional scientific theory in your science class. Peter, not only is this disturbing to the members of this community, but I'm gonna lose my job. You take five minutes and go out in the hallway and you decide if you're gonna sign this. The choice is up to you. Either sign it or you'll be suspended. (crickets chirping) - Peter, you can get out of this mess if you just apologize. - Apologize? For talking about God who's my best friend? - Peter, it's a school, you've broken the law, separation of church and state. - Did Peter and Paul stop preaching when the government tried to separate God from the people? - That was the first century. We have Christian Television now. - Dad, can't you do something? You are a lawyer. - Dean, you could at least look into it. - Well, maybe I can try to find somebody to help but I just can't get involved. - You just don't care. You don't care if laws are against God, or break the 10 Commandments. You see, I'm not called to be the politician. If a man is attacked on the street, you say God is not calling me to risk my life. If the treacherous government swallow up the people, you say the Lord is not calling me to set the captive free. I might get killed, but some day we might be in chains. - Oh, come on, this is America. - Peter, I can't listen to you when you're that angry. - Mom, if he's telling the truth, it doesn't matter. - I'm sorry. - Peter, the youth group at church is having an ice cream party tonight. Why don't you go? - I'm not hungry. - Maybe he should start seeing David's counselor. - Maybe he should find another place to stay. - [Peter] That night, I realized I had failed but God was working in my American family even that night while they dreamed. (tense percussive music) - Mom, look, I'm gonna play the big board game. Choice, huh? Broadway or the Narrow Way. Hey mom, what do I do? There's two roads here. - I don't understand this. Mom, the stuff won't fit, what should I do? - Don't go through it then. You're gonna lose all those things. David. David. (speaking foreign language) (engine revving) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] In about 15 minutes, you will be disembarking on the (speaking foreign language) and going back to the Soviet Union. - [Peter] You will not win in the war, man. - We will win because we're willing to die for our cause. For you and your Christian friends in America, there is nothing worth dying for. - [Peter] And we wanted to live in freedom. - Then take the easy way out by telling us you'll cooperate. It will be the end of all your troubles. - Don't you wish? (clattering) (upbeat music) (splashing) - This is not the last we will see of you. (birds chirping) (children shouting faintly) - [Man] So how's the Russian front? - We're in the middle of a cold war, I guess. - You'd be better off getting that kid into a good halfway house program. You know, I get the signal from the board. They'd be willing to drop the whole thing if they could save their faces and have the kid apologize. - Legally I don't think they're gonna get out of it that easily. - What do you wanna do, fight it out in court? You know, Dean, I've known you 11 years and I always thought you prided yourself on going down the middle of the road on these kinds of things. - When this trial ends in just a few hours, it will be a landmark test of whether religion will be allowed to continue to be forced into our public schools. - But then I am disappointed to find those in America, that they're trying to build a wall to separate God from the people, because that is just what they tried to do in my country. Now our churches are turned into factories or gymnasiums and they punish those that worship God. It has left our people starving. I love America and I pray that does not happen here. That is all I have to say. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Peter, isn't it true that you openly read Bible passages to the students of your science class after the teacher repeatedly told you to be quiet? - No, I did not read. - And didn't you force students to attend your lunchroom religious services? - No, they came because they wanted to hear. - And didn't you tell your history teacher that if she didn't believe as you did, she would experience eternal punishment? - No, I did not say that. - That is all, Your Honor. - Your Honor, the plaintiff rests his case. - [Judge] You may step down. - The defense calls Mrs. Emily Nation to the stand. - Mrs. Nation to the stand. (audience murmuring) Emily Nation to the stand. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your name, please. - Emily Nation. - Mrs. Nation, what is your relationship to the plaintiff, Peter Smyslov? - Well, it's actually my daughter who had the misfortune of being in the plaintiff's history and science classes. - And can you describe for the court what your daughter experienced in those classes? - My daughter Darlene is a responsible girl who came to this school to get an education. Needless to say, the class time spent discussing fairytales about some so-called creation science placed an undue amount of stress on her academic life, saying nothing of the trauma she experienced when that fanatic and his friends tried to force a religious track on her. You know, Darlene developed a rash about that time and I think it was all that religious activity that did it. - A rash, you say? - Yes, a rash, a very big rash all along her neck and her back, oh, a big rash. - [Man] A big rash. - Oh, yes. - Thank you, Mrs. Nation. That's all, Your Honor. - Mrs. Nation, I believe I heard you refer to JFK as a public high school, is that correct? - Yes, that is correct. - And isn't it true that last year, you succeeded in having a Christmas tree removed from the lobby of this public high school? - Yes, I did. - And didn't you threaten to file suit if this public high school library did not have several books on Bible history removed? - Yes, that is correct. - And if you had the chance, Mrs. Nation, wouldn't you remove all references to God not only from this public school but from every public place in this country? - I object, Your Honor. - Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. - This is a public high school. If they wanna teach their kids that religious stuff, then let them send them to a private school. - If that were to happen, Mrs. Nation, who would be left in our public schools? Just people who believe as you do, correct? - [Emily] Well, not necessarily. - Doesn't a public high school mean a forum for free thinking? Doesn't a public high school mean freedom from religious persecution? - Yes, well, but the Bill of Rights, the Constitution states that there's supposed to be a separation of church and state. - Does it really, Mrs. Nation? - Yes. - I believe this is a copy of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights. Would you care to show us where it talks about the separation of church and state? - I'm sure it's in there some place. If I could just read-- - Mrs. Nation, I believe you will find what you are looking for in our Soviet constitution. - I object, Your Honor. The council for the plaintiff is tampering with courtroom fixtures. - Objection sustained. Will Mr. McBride kindly put the Constitution back on the wall carefully? - I'm very sorry, Your Honor. I'm through questioning the witness. - You may step down. - Thank you. - Peter Smyslov, this courageous young man risked his life to come to this country, to a free country, but now he is being denied that freedom because his school authorities insist that there is an impregnable wall in the United States Constitution which gives public high school students the right to strongly express any other set of beliefs except for religious ones. Would you have condemned Peter for doing what he did in Russia? Would you have condemned him if he stood with Peter or Paul or Wycliffe or Jan Hus in opposing sacrilegious laws of an earlier age? And yet we comfortably label Peter a militant or a radical and we self-righteously cry separation of church and state. And we're not gonna intend just to separate God from our schools but to separate him from our theaters and concert halls and government offices and homes as well. Clearly, our forefathers who established Thanksgiving as a national holiday shortly after passing the Bill of Rights did not intend to inflict the kind of punishment that has been heaped upon Peter today whose only crime has been to unyieldingly stand for what he believes. (gentle music) - After carefully reviewing the facts of this case and giving full consideration to all parties, this court concludes that because the school district is not constitutionally required to deny Peter his right to express his religious views on school grounds, the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff and this court orders high school districts-- - [Peter] Winter came. God was leading me into a new understanding of battles that needed to be fought far beyond the courtroom, and one day, the cup that I had put away for so long came into my life once again. (sinister music) (grunting) - Oh, David, you scare me like KGB, man. - What's that? - My parents gave me this cup just before they went to prison. They said, Peter, never forget the cup of suffering Jesus took for us. It is a cup filled with fire and very painful to drink but if you love him, he will show you how to drink this for him and shine like gold. - [David] But why do you have to suffer over here? I mean, look what the judge said. - Yes, the judge said I could talk about Jesus at school but was the real battle in the courtroom? - Wasn't it? - David, I believe the battle now is not for religious freedom or even against communism. Sure, I still dream of freedom for my people. Many empty churches across our Russian countryside can once again be filled. My country now is falling apart, but we will love the world and lose everything to follow Jesus. In Russia you could not be lukewarm. We baptize our Christians and we may never see them again. Our hearts were like gold thrown in the fire. - Well, I wish I could be strong like the Christians in Russia. - David, after we ask Jesus into our hearts, he can show us how to walk the narrow road, and if we truly love him, we will deny ourselves and pick up his cross and follow him, wherever we are, whatever the cost.
