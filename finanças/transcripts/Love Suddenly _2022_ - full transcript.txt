My name is Kong. I'm a professional food deliveryman. I always deliver the food to my customers on time because saving humanity from the torment of hunger is my calling. However, calling is just a concept. In reality, delivering food brings me a shot at finding love. Coming. Thank you. Only well-prepared people like me deserve a shot. What a pity. As the saying goes, "No pain, no gain." I will have a shot at finding a single girl. Well, you got to be kidding me. Look at his squinty, scornful eyes. However, I'm not going to give up. Hello, Kong. You're three minutes early today. Miss. Here are your two pork chop combos. Bon app√©tit. I'm all alone, but I ordered two combos. Can you guess why? You're starving, so you need double? No. I ordered one for you so that we can eat together. Come on in and eat with me. No, thank you. I'm allergic to pork chop. My prayers aren't always answered. Some say true love is like a ghost. Everybody talks about it, but few have seen it. Seeing a ghost is a matter of luck. One day, when my luck comes, I'm going to see love. Come in. Hi, I'm Shirley. I just moved in. I made these cookies for you. There you are. Nice to meet you, Shirley. I'm Kong. Hi, Kong. I'll have some. My room is next to yours. Our beds are just separated by a wall, so we're like sleeping together. Sleeping together? Please tell me if I'm too noisy at night. Gosh. Your collection is impressive. She's my roommate. Her name is Jenny Thalia. Nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Sure. Did you order mine with less ice? No. I have to use the washroom. Off to the washroom. 4DX with environmental effects Hey, Ho. Hey, Snow, what a coincidence. I thought you'd be at your mom's checkup. She canceled it last minute, so I'm catching a movie instead. Shall we watch it together? Of course. Theater one is open now. Let me buy the tickets first and I'll see you there. Sure. Why do you have two sodas? Buy one get one free. Take one. Okay. What's wrong with you? Let's go. We're late. Where's the other soda? I was so thirsty that I finished it. Let's go. What's the hurry? I don't want to miss any second of a Hong Kong movie. It has been 15 minutes. Have you bought the ticket? The soda must have gone bad. My stomach is churning. Can I go to the washroom? Jeez, just go. Set as wallpaper Snow, the soda must have gone bad. My stomach is churning. Set as wallpaper Can I go to the washroom? Go then. I'll go with you. But it's the men's room. Baby, let's leave and find you a doctor. Good idea. Taxi. Ho. Why don't you get in? You may get sick if you visit the hospital. Go home first. I'll meet you after that, okay? Please drive, sir. Bye. I'm such a genius. It's really good. Why don't you eat? What's wrong, baby? Didn't you have the runs? How can you still eat? Well, I got everything flushed out, so I'm just going to fill it up again. Don't get me started. You kept buzzing around at the cinema. It totally killed my mood for the movie. Don't be mad. How about this? Let's catch the next showing. Give me your phone. Who is this? She is... a girl I sponsored two years ago. Isn't she a bit too old for that? No, she's just tall for her age. Let's all meet up together. She died from leukemia three years ago. She died from leukemia three years ago, but you're sponsoring her two years ago. Are you sponsoring a ghost? Baby, I'm sorry. My math sucks. I'll chop it off. Press it hard. How are you feeling now? Hey, where are you going? It's still there. I must celebrate with a piss. You just hurt your foot. Don't move around. Come on. You want to piss? Go on. You made history by becoming the enemy of every woman at the hospital. Everyone says you're a jerk. Hey, it's hard for me too. I truly love both of them. They didn't have a clue, so you had to do all the lying. You have to watch whatever you do or say. You're always spooked. It's the hardest for you. You're good. What a perceptive insight. It's a risky business though. You should've been more careful. You have yourself to blame if they found out. They should never know the truth. If you want an easier life, tell them upfront that you're also seeing someone else. Then you can be like me, handling ten partners like a pro. You're bluffing. Ten partners? How can any man be so tolerant? I'm not sure if they're tolerant. Take it or leave it. I don't want trouble. All right. It's time to work. Look over there. He looks so good. Yes. Call me. My name is Jerome. I'm a rental boyfriend. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a gigolo. I only rent out my time to fulfill my clients' psychological needs. Physical needs won't be entertained. As long as they pay, we'll try our best to solve their problems and make them happy. We serve clients of all ages and genders, so I do feel queasy sometimes. Running together: +3000, Wiping sweat: +300, Touching hands: +500 However, I remind myself every day that I'm a service industry professional. For money, I'll put up with anything. After all, it's just a job. Ms. Dai, Occupation: College student Accepted Thank you very much. Did I scare you, miss? Excuse me, miss? Rental Boyfriend So you're Ms. Dai. Hello. I'm Jerome. I don't mean to scare you. I just want... to hear your needs clearly. You can talk more comfortably now. I'm sorry. I've been forced to speak lightly since I was young. They say it's rude to talk loudly. How could they? You have such a sweet voice. Also, my family makes me stay away from men. In that case, since your family is not here now, perhaps you can set those rules aside. I'm so sorry. I'll lose it if any guy comes too close to me. You'd better keep your distance. My family says my boyfriend must be of the same social rank. I met a guy on the Internet recently. He's educated and rich. He meets my family's standards. He said he'll return to Hong Kong to meet me on Valentine's Day. But look at me... So you want to practice with me. I hope you'll help me so that I can act normally when I meet him. Money is not an issue. Don't worry. You'll meet the guy like a normal girl. Right, what's your name? My name is Dai Kam. Do you have an English name? Silver. It's so tacky. Just call me Ms. Dai. Cheer up, Silver. To great partnership. What is Mercury retrograde? It's Mercury moving backward. You're more likely to have relationship problems or fights. I can't win you in a fight, so I'll put up with you. Scorpio men, be more understanding to your girlfriends. If you like our videos, please subscribe to and share our channel. Write to us if you have any questions. - Bye. - Bye. Look at our new video. We only have a few dozen views. We can't even afford cup noodles later. Love at First Sight Look, someone just unsubscribed. Why? The two videos before were just fine. Pong Kwong. It's Kong. Did you see our new video? You two keep showing off how loving you are. It's boring. People like watching others suffering these days. Kong. We need to do something new then. Wong Chung can't stand spicy food. I got his favorite red bean soup today, but it's spiked. He'll be home soon. Let's see how he likes it. Let's go. Wong Chung is back. I'm home. You're back late. I bought you your favorite red bean soup today. Why are you being so nice to me? I'm always nice to you. That's true. Here. Are you crazy? It's so spicy! Are you trying to kill me? You see. That's how Wong Chung lashes out. Today's prank is a success. If you like this video, click subscribe and share our channel with others. We'll bring you more surprises next time. Bye. Why did you prank me for real? To get a realistic response from you. If I had asked you to act, you would've looked fake. Go get the cushion washed. Otherwise, the entire house will stink tomorrow. I have to clean up after being pranked? Good idea. I can't get it, Jenny. What now? I really can't get it. What should I do? Will it be too aggressive to listen outside her door? It's worth a try. Hey, Kong. The sound insulation here is so poor. Exactly. How can we sleep like that? She's so inconsiderate. You go to bed first. I'll yell at her. You're better off hearing the action. Don't miss it. Shoot. Damn. Tools for wall drilling. This couple... He's so poor. It's time for medication. Thank you. Your medication, jerk. Please take my hand and just say yes Just say there's nothing holding you back Hooray. Come here. Your hand. What are you doing? I'm proposing. Proposing? It's blackmailing with such a crowd. Didn't I tell you not to show up when I'm at work? You did, but how can I propose without showing up? What day is it today? Friday. What day are we supposed to meet? I'm number nine. I'm supposed to see you next Thursday. But it'll be Chinese New Year and I have to swap my days off. If I miss it, I won't see you until the Wednesday after. You blackmail me and you don't play by my rules. It's pointless to stay together. Let's break up. I'm sorry. Please give me another chance. I won't do it again. Clean the mess. Tin Tin. That's how women are. Tin Tin, I'll never do it again. What a loser. You don't need to call me. Your androphobia is caused by a lack of confidence. You can sort this out by absorbing the aura of men and talking with them. I had only attended girls' schools. Apart from my dad and male teachers, I rarely see men. I don't know how to behave in front of them. Just leave the job to them. Boys. This is group therapy. By having the boys corner you in a tiny space, we'll breach your five-step safe distance. Enjoy, Silver. Don't worry, miss. I'm rental boyfriend No. 8 and also a movie assistant director. Hey, you... Stay away from me. Stay away from me... Do you feel better after taking it out on them? I don't know. Look up. We're so close now. It means that this method works. Just do this every day and I'm sure you'll be fine. But I'm not sure about them. Keep practicing every day and your androphobia will be gone. However, you beat them to a pulp. I have to find a new gang tomorrow. Try to be more gentle tomorrow. Hey, gorgeous. Be gentle on what? Sorry. Your boyfriend? I'll leave you two in peace then. Kong. It's Shirley. What are you doing? Miss, I'm studying the Bible. I shall not steal nor commit adultery. I didn't do anything wrong. Can you come to my room? Such an act would be scandalous. Miss, please leave. However, it's better to do certain things with someone. I want to do it with you. Sure. I can go anytime. Lord, please forgive us. Are you ready? Let's try to know each other better first. Don't waste time. People usually get a drink to wind down first. We can't do it if we're drunk. Why? If we're drunk, how can I work on my assignment? Assignment? What else? I major in film studies in Australia. Now, I'm working on my thesis. I already came up with the title, ‚ÄúThe Rise and Fall of Erotic Arthouse Films in Hong Kong.‚Äù That's why I'm back to do research. I don't know much about porn. Great. Neither do I. Let's study it together. I want to audition for a role. In a porn movie? I'll support you by watching it. No, I'll be undercover. I'll secretly film the production process. I do know a thing or two about porn. I've been watching ‚ÄúA Tale of Two Titties.‚Äù I never finished it. Is it good? No. But it's okay. The first time I met you, I thought you were perfect for the male lead, so I want you to film it for me. I'd better stick with food delivery. I have no one else to turn to. I have nobody in Hong Kong. Don't worry. I'll rehearse with you. Script Scene 1, Beast rips Beauty's clothes before epic shags All right then. Yes. What? Go rehearse alone. What? - You said you'd rehearsed with me. - Yes. I mean the read-through. Silver has a boyfriend at last. As her dad, I must try my best to be a gracious host. This meal is cooked by a Le Cordon Bleu chef. Please help yourself. Yes. Help... Help yourself. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Dai. Let's dig in. Try this cheese. It's freshly air-freighted from Italy. It smells amazing. Mr. Dai. Are these maggots? Of course, it's maggot cheese. They're very important for breaking down the cheese's fats. The product is a marvelous liquid. It's the essence called teardrop. So this cheese is very precious. Also, be gentle when you cut it. The maggots are very timid. When startled, they'll jump. It launched into my eye. If you don't like maggots, you can try this dish. Slow-cooked Rocky Mountain oyster. Sure. This oyster is so unique. It's sweet and it has... A texture like meat. Rocky Mountain oyster is what it's called in the Western US. They're bull testicles. Don't be fooled by the name ‚Äúoyster.‚Äù If you don't like testicles, you can eat fish. This dish is... That's enough. If you have a problem with me, just say it. Stop beating around the bush. Brat. My daughter won't fall for you. Get lost and find a rich cougar. Dad, it's all my fault. Stop fighting because of me. Shut up. You have no right to stop her. Of course I do. I own her. You're just a bully. Fight me if you dare. Sure. Clear the table. Stop seeing my daughter if you lose. Stop controlling your daughter if you lose. Come on. Holy sugar. Why is there a mouse? Of course, it's mouse wine. Bottoms up. - Jerome. - Baby. Baby, your dad is lighter. Go and carry him. I'm used to hauling heavy stuff. I'll carry him. Hurry up. Go. Gosh. Mom. Gosh, hang in there. Hang in there. I took Dad to the car. What are you doing? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He's only drunk. I'll take care of your dad for you. Let me check on him. He has a heartbeat, but it's really fast. Keep him warm. Thank you. I should be the one thanking you. You drank so much because you stood up for me. I need to lie down. Can you find something to talk about? Take it as practice. I don't know what to talk about. You can share your secrets. I'll go first. After meeting my first girlfriend in ninth grade, I've never fallen in love again. Back then, I was a chubby boy, I weighed over 90 kg. I thought my girlfriend didn't mind my look. It turned out that she tricked me with her friends. The world is full of deceit. True love doesn't exist. Actually... There are a lot of props in the script which I've prepared for you. Study them hard and listen up, okay? Bondage is essential. It's very simple. It starts from the neck, then collarbone, breastbone, and finally pubic bone. Gather the ropes at the back and tie a knot. After that, loop here and there. Finally, gather the ends above your belly button and there you have your legendary Japanese bondage, understood? What a marvelous talk, Shirley. You could've just talked. Why did you tie me up? A great actor should act from the bottom of his heart. If you don't experience it, how do you know your counterpart's feeling? If you don't know that, you can't be a great actor. Why don't you untie me? I want to practice tying you up. The best is yet to come. Light a candle? I do that for myself on every birthday. It's wax play. The book says to bring a 60-degree Celsius candle to 30 cm from the target, then slowly tilt 40 degrees and let the wax drip. The endorphins in your body will erupt at this very moment. You'll feel exhilarated. So? Do you feel good? Yes. There you go. It hurts! Didn't you say it felt good? I'm sorry, Kong. This candle is for tomb sweeping. Let's do it again with another one. Kong. Are you okay? Shirley? Yes. This room isn't exactly soundproof. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's nothing. I burn wax every Mid-Autumn Festival. That's just peanuts. No worries. I'm so sorry. Shirley. I kind of like chatting with you behind the wall. It's pretty handy. You can chat with me anytime. Sure. Let's do it now. Do you have a boyfriend? No. A lot of guys ask me out, but I don't have feelings for them. If you ask me what feelings mean exactly, I don't really have an answer. So I've only had two relationships. How about you? I've had zero. I wasn't laughing at you. I didn't laugh at you. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's not a competition. I have tons of guys asking me out, but if none of them is Mr. Right, it'd mean nothing. Am I right? Have a good rest, Kong. Good night. Remember to use an ice pack. Good night. I told you. That video saved our channel. We'll meet a sponsor later. Be cool, okay? Okay. Hello, Mr. Chan. Nice backdrop. You sure know how to enjoy life. I've watched your channel. You're quite creative. We'll launch some couple sportswear for Valentine's Day. We'd like you to promote them. No problem, Mr. Chan. We'll do our best to tailor-make a video for you. It's a Valentine's Day special, so we must have the video before Valentine's Day. It must be sweet. Most importantly, wholesome. Okay? Don't worry, Mr. Chan. We'll act sweet. And wholesome. One more condition. Your channel must have 200,000 subscribers before Valentine's Day. Otherwise, we won't pay you. But our number of subscribers falls a little short of that. That's your problem. I'll email you the contract later, okay? Help. What are you doing? I bought a chastity belt, but I forgot the key. Do you have any tools? I only have a hammer. I'm scared. You do it. Harder. I'll find a locksmith then. Don't use so many props in the video. Just sign the contract and email it to me, okay? Sure. No problem at all, Mr. Chan. Nice meeting you. Gosh. It's 200,000 subscribers. If we can't reach it, we'll get nothing. Let's just sign it anyway. Don't miss this opportunity. We'll figure out how to boost our views. Baby, how did you get stabbed? I got robbed. Maybe I had too little cash, so the robber got mad and stabbed me. It must hurt so bad. Baby, if... Let's say I was hiding something from you, would you forgive me? Of course. You treat me so well. If I was hiding something from you, would you forgive me? Of course. You treat me so well. Otherwise, I'd be struck by lightning. Hi. You want to stab me once more? I've come to kill you this time. Go die. Go die. What kind of mugger are you? The killing kind? I'm his girlfriend. No, I'm his girlfriend. He lied to you. He's a cheater. Silly woman. Go die. I said I was hiding something from you. This is the thing. Will you forgive me? I absolutely won't forgive you. Carry on. Don't mind me. It's better if you get his artery though. If he makes it, we have to work overtime. It's exhausting. Go on. Keep stabbing. By the way, we have more security guards because of the Chinese New Year. Watch out when you go. Don't get caught. Otherwise, you're finished. If I were you, I won't ruin my life for a scum like him. Why did you lie to me? I never thought that you're into violent women. They're not like that normally. Ching is a tough girl, but she's very kind. She wouldn't even kill an ant. Snow is gentle. She never yells at me. I never thought that women could go nuts when they're angry. You don't seem to understand them. I don't believe you understand all your ten boyfriends. I'm trying to. My fortune teller said if I can get married before 30, my life will be sorted. However, if I'm still not married at 30, I'll be alone for the rest of my life. I'm already 27. I only have three years left. If I get to know them before dating only to break up later, it will be a waste of time. For your future, you're doing a very reasonable thing. Keeping ten guys must be tough. I'm fair to each one of them. I spend every holiday season alone. They don't need to fight about it. It's sad to spend the holidays alone. Since I'll be stuck at the hospital for a while, Ms. Chan, I'll keep you company. You never know who's keeping whom company. Eat your noodles. Hey, I picked a comedy movie on purpose to make you laugh, but why didn't you even laugh? I'm sorry. I think it's embarrassing to giggle, so I always try to resist it. You need to express your emotions. Try to laugh harder next time. Shouldn't you apologize? - I'm sorry. - Didn't your parents teach you manners? I'm sorry. You're just mumbling. Who can hear you? Stop playing innocent. I'm not buying it. I don't hit women. - Whack him. - You're in luck. - Come on. - Is it fun playing innocent? Isn't it nice to laugh? Let's go for another movie. A scary one as screaming practice. Sorry. I'm sorry. I have to... Well done. You can talk to him on the phone. Watch it online at home then, okay? Scream if you're scared. Mr. and Mrs. Dai, may I ask what this is again? We're not related. Call me Boss Dai. I ran a check on you. You're a rental boyfriend. A toyboy who sponges off women. Boss Dai, you must be mistaken. It's your daughter who hired me to help her. I didn't use her. Is she such an idiot? Will she pay for fake affection? You named her Silver for that's all you care about. Do you know she's sad? Why would she be sad? She's well-fed and clothed. She can buy whatever she wants. She's the envy of everyone. - But... - But what? She really is happier now. She smiles much more. Sorry. Both of you are too controlling with your daughter. That's why she has no self-confidence. She doesn't even dare to laugh. She just wants to be normal. That's why she hires me to help her out. How pitiful. Thank you for helping her. Fine. Carry on your good work, but I'm paying instead. Report to me daily. Don't you dare to fancy her. And don't let any man fancy her. Sorry. I won't betray her. What a stand-up guy. Where's your office? - Can I have your number? - How about 500 dollars more? What's up? Let's sneak off for afternoon tea. No, I'm exhausted. You look worried. What's wrong? I just bought groceries. I have to buy video games for Wong Chung after this. You're spoiling him. Let him do it himself. He's racking his brain for our videos. Don't get me started. They're so boring and fake. Obviously, you're not for each other. You should ditch him now. At least you can save yourself from faking on those videos. I feel embarrassed just by watching. Making videos is our common interest. As for house chores, I have time so I can do them. It doesn't matter. You always find excuses for him. Do you want to meet after buying his game? No, I have to go home and see what I can help. You're hopeless. Bye then. What the heck are you doing? I'm asking you. Answer me. Ask him. He asked me to come in. I wasn't talking to you, wench. - I can explain this. - What's there to explain? You're sleeping with another woman. No, listen to me. What? I know you like her. You said she's hot right when she moved in, but I never thought that you'd be cheating on me. - I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? I can only say I'm sorry - because I finally tricked you. - Yes. See, this is what Zoe looks like when she's mad. We'll go further if there are more subscribers. Please share it so we can get more subscribers. - Bye. - Bye. I'm going to do my assignment. Right. - We're just joking. - You went too far. How else can we get viewers? You could've told me earlier. It's you who said that real pranks work best. It's different. You got her in bed. I didn't do anything. Trust me, okay? Trust you? You love lying. Why did you say that? Do you remember what you promised me? You said you'd do something special for me on special occasions. What have you done all these years? I did everything the first year, but you didn't seem excited. I thought you didn't like it. It wasn't a problem before. Now, it suddenly is. So you admit that you've done nothing for me and fooled me all these years, right? You're unreasonable. I'm out of here. Why are you drinking coffee here? Have you made up with Zoe? How? She went totally ballistic. Women are impossible. They're so demanding. Nothing pleases them. At least you have a girl to please. I have nobody to please. Stay where you are. You really know nothing. Women are tricky. You never know what they're thinking. You sound desperate. So you want to break up? I didn't say that. I just need to vent. Exactly. Go make up with her. Make it okay as soon as possible. How? She thinks she's right about everything. Women are simple. Be nice and they'll forgive you. Cook her a meal. You always get takeouts. She'll be happy if you cook. You're right. You owe me 36 dollars. I'll make dinner. Chung, hang in there. Coffee, please. Are you getting coffee too? Why didn't you ask Chung to get it? Well, he's busy flirting with girls. Don't say that. He's just doing it for your channel. He's not cheating on you. Do you mean business is more important than me? It's your business too. He cares about the business because of you. Honestly, he's very stressed. You can cut him some slack sometimes. Pong Kwong, how do you know he's stressed? Sorry. It's Kong. He told me. You mean he's telling everyone I'm bad to him? He's just letting off steam. How dare he? Hey. Did she pay? Hey. Wong Chung. Are you a man or not? You keep bad-mouthing your girlfriend. I was cooking noodles for you. How could I bad-mouth you? Kong told me. It was just a chat. You chatted with him too. I only do small talk with him. Okay, so that was a small talk, but when I do it, it's bad-mouthing you, right? Don't be so cheeky. Do you know that all my friends told me this? "You have no future with Wong Chung. Ditch him and find someone new." I defended you every time. I said, "That's not true. Wong Chung is great. He cares about me." I stood by you all these years, but you've never appreciated me. Why don't you say something? What do you want? Do whatever you want. Okay. Let's break up. Wait. Breaking up aside, shoot the Valentine's Day video first. You can include your previous work here. Shirley, shall we swap seats? Okay. Remember, don't block the camera. Don't worry. I've done a lot of practice. We'll get it for sure. Who is auditioning? He is. I'm his manager. Why don't you have a go too, gorgeous? No way. No one can go on her, including me. Go on then, porky. Stop ogling. Come on in. Undress. Undress? Yes, for taking photos as a record. Strip everything. Underwear too? I can do it myself. Raise your arms. Both arms. It's done. It's done? Get dressed. No rehearsal at all? No need. You're in luck. The director will see you. The director will see me? Porky, you're a gem. Your look, body build, and size are one of a kind. I'll make you a star. You'll be the male lead in my movie, so you'll undergo a series of training. You need to learn French, Japanese, Hindi, and most importantly, yoga. The erotic kind. The movie will be an international hit. Great. When will you start shooting? I can be on set during filming. Unfortunately, our movie falls a little short of budget. So I'd like to invite you both to invest in this movie. You'll be rich and famous and it'll be a win-win for us. It's not a lot. Two million. - Two million? - Two million? If you're short of money, I can keep the memory card for you. Porky. Your watch is quite special. It's from my mom. Are you filming us? Don't mess with me, you wench. Let's go. I'll drive. Hold on to me. It feels so amazing to be protected. Shirley went all out to save me. I can see love finally. Also, I can touch love too. Luckily, we ran fast enough. Luckily, I saved your materials. Luckily, I saved your nude photos too. Why don't you let me keep it? Seriously? I was just kidding. Do you have enough materials for your thesis? Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with? Not really. You helped me a lot. Thank you. - I'll go back to my room. - I'll go back to my room. What's the matter, Kong? Drinking milk won't help. Chung, you won't understand. You and Shirley are always together. I thought you made it. Chung, I've been to her room and got on top of her... bed. I held her hand and put my arms around her. We've even had a wax play. And then? And then... And then nothing came after. Does she know you like her? I didn't tell her. How is she supposed to know then? Silly boy, we wouldn't even be friends if I told her. Do you just want to be her friend? That'd solve everything if I just wanted friendship. She's a graduate student. I'm a food delivery guy. She'll leave Hong Kong anyway and she has tons of suitors. Me? She wouldn't fall for me. Since you think she's not into you, what can you lose by telling her? I have nothing to lose. I'm just scared. Right. Drink if you're scared. Drink more if you're still scared. If you do nothing, giving you a hundred chances will all go to waste. Silly boy, listen to me. Love isn't an idea or a word. It's an action. Think it through. I should've tried harder to learn English. Now, I can't understand a word. Kong. Thank you so much for your help. You're a really great guy. Unfortunately, we met at the wrong time. If we could spend more time together, we might be closer than we already were. I must go back to Australia. Take care. Remember to stay kind and generous. Some day, you'll find someone like me who'll appreciate your inner beauty. Shirley. PS. I couldn't get hold of you to take a photo with you, so I'll take this plug on the wall with me as a souvenir of us. Who told me to drink? Wong Chung! - Hello. - Hello.

Experts said creating memories with your better half can strengthen your relationship. So today, we'll show you an amazing Valentine's Day activity. Let's go. Hey. Take your own bag. That's right. We're doing it in the wild today. Thrilling activities can stimulate love hormones in the body to release love molecules and make you feel loved. Yes, the more thrilling the sweeter. Wong Chung, don't forget to cover me later. I'll sacrifice my life to protect you. Hey, watch out! Let me protect you. Go! You jerk. What kind of therapy is it? Actually, you're almost good to go. Take it as your graduation exam. Let's see if you can release yourself. Take mine as well. I really don't know how to shoot. That's perfect. Fear can release human potential. Believe in yourself.

Guys, if death is inevitable in reality, have your lover kill you rather than someone else. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone! Wong Chung! What? Why did you shoot me? To make our love story unforgettable. Let's make it tragic. What do you mean? Hey. - Don't move. Stay there. - Help. I had so much fun today. Rental Boyfriend Order completed, pay 50,000 dollars Thank you for helping me all this time. Order completed, client paid 50,000 dollars Decline Please take my service as my blessing to you. I hope you can find the love that you long for. It's me who came to you. You deserve the money. I don't want our relationship to be transactional. Maybe we can be friends. It's your fault. You just kept snapping. Now you got us lost. Well done. We can't even find the way down. We rarely come here and the sunset was spectacular. It'd be a waste to not take photos. I can't walk anymore. I'm tired. Please don't start it. I'm tired too. Let's get us home sooner. Come on. Stop, you punk. Give me your money and phones. Wong Chung, do something. Hey, I'm talking to you. I am thinking. Do you really hate talking to me now? We've been working and living together every single day for seven years. I don't always know what to talk about. If you don't talk, how do I know what you're thinking? I'm sorry. I did want to do something special. I stopped not because you didn't seem to care. It's just that there are too many festivities. New Year, Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, White Day, Easter, Dragon Boat Festival, Tomb Sweeping Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, Halloween, Christmas, birthdays, anniversaries, and the anniversary... of our first movie together. I can't possibly celebrate all of them. I want to celebrate them with you just because I want some shared memories with you. Otherwise, all we do is just edit videos, eat, and sleep. I never said I wanted to celebrate every one of them. One special occasion a year isn't too much, right? Once a year is doable, of course. I promise you. On every Valentine's Day, I'll create some unique memories with you. What do you think? It's passable. How do I know if you'll keep your word? If so, stop being mad and smile then. I can't see your face. You have to laugh out loud. Shut up. Just get someone to untie us. The rope is so tight. Who should I get? Stop acting. I know the photo snapping and robbery are just setups. Where's the camera? Is it rolling? You've overestimated me. What? This is real? Looks like we have to scream. - Help! - Help! - Help! - Help! - Help! - Anybody there? Ms. Chan was right. Deep down, I thought you were not good enough. That's why I cheated on you. Snow, please wake up. Wake up and whack me. My little sister, who did this to you? I'll make him pay for sure. This way, boss. I still remember how you fought alone with a machete and made Nathan Road our turf. Who did this to you? Boss, I found out that she has been dating this guy. She must have been ditched. Being ditched can't give her a coma. I also found that this nurse gave her a poisonous jab. That's why she's in a coma. What a filthy couple. Get her here. Yes, boss. Don't move. Have you seen this guy before? No. Of course not. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Boss, he looks like Ms. Snow's boyfriend. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Get them right now! I'm here. Let's go. This way, boss. Let's go. - Happy Valentine's Day. - Happy Valentine's Day. We're in trouble. Let's go. What's wrong with you? Sorry, guys. Let me borrow her. - What's the matter? - Just go. We're screwed. It turns out Snow is a gangster leader. Her brother is looking for you. You're really screwed. Take some responsibility. It's you who put her in a coma. What are you talking about? I just gave her glucose. - The doctor said she'll be fine. - I don't care. Her brother wants to kill you. I've got to go. Does the gangster leader look like Ma Dong-seok? Raise both arms. Like this. Give me a big smile. You need to reach higher. It's not high enough. On your toes. Okay, another shot. Amazing. You did very well. One more. Okay, next. Get in line, sir. That's right. Get in line. Okay. One, two, three. You're so photogenic. Snoopy looks tired. Snoopy needs a ten-minute break. Stay here. He'll be back. You, don't move. Go. Come on. Jerome. Silver? I thought you were meeting your boyfriend. Did he stand you up? I met him yesterday. He's very handsome and rich. So what exactly happened? I slapped him the moment I saw him. I don't know why, but when I was with him, I couldn't say a word, like a mute. That's impossible. You're perfectly normal with me now. Right. I don't know why, but I'm only normal when I'm with you. It's Valentine's Day today. Can you keep me company? I'm not sure because I've quit being a rental boyfriend. That's perfect. I'm not going to pay you. Because... I don't want our relationship to be transactional. But... I don't want us to be friends only. We have a balcony at home. Why did you take me all the way here to have this candlelight dinner thingy? It's so corny. This house is up for rent. I have to beg my agent friend to let us have dinner here. It's corny, but I've put in a lot of effort. I made everything myself. It's so windy here. My hair is a mess now. Also, who would put a sunny-side up egg on a steak? The egg is so raw. You know I don't eat raw eggs. I don't cook much. Please go easy on me. I promise that our future home will have an even better sea view than here, okay? How can I clean such a big house? I prefer where we're living. Didn't you say you don't eat raw eggs? But it's you who cooked it. I have to try it. I wonder how things are with Kong and Shirley. Do you have a death wish, Wong Chung? You should be thinking of me only. He left Hong Kong because of the booze I gave him. I wonder if he found Shirley. You can call him if you want. Hi. Why is it you? Kong is occupied right now. Who is it? Give me. Hi, Chung. Pong Kwong. What a perfect timing. Things are going well with you two. Well, my master likes wax play during a festive occasion. Happy Valentine's Day. We're just rehearsing. Rehearsing? I can be your producer. Seriously. What did you say? I was just kidding. That's a close call. We're lucky to get away. Why am I here? I want to go home. What is this place? A drug rehabilitation center? Every Valentine's Day, I used to give my girlfriends a surprise. But this year, I lost them both, so I brought you instead. I don't want to waste it. That's so thoughtful. You're so smart. Okay, let's go. Wait up. Sit back down. Why? What? It's time. Why are there fireworks? Fireworks! Let's watch it together. It's so beautiful. Happy Valentine's Day. Fireworks on Valentine's Day? No way. I organized it. It costs all my savings. That's tens of thousands of dollars. You know what? You're the first guy I've spent Valentine's Day with. It's nice to spend it with someone. If you don't mind, I can spend it with you every year. What? You want to be my number 11? What 11? I'm not a dum-dum. You broke up with that Snoopy. That makes me number 10. Do your math. We'll see. It's so beautiful. I ordered one for you. Come and eat with me. I'm allergic to pork chop. Bye. I couldn't hold my laugh. Sorry. Let's do this again. You've forgotten. You forgot to look at me. Was it too close? No. Bring it on. Come on. No. No. No. Whack her. Yes. One, two, three. Sorry. Sorry. We need to run faster. - Cut. - Go. Well, I guess I have to find a locksmith. Darn it. Come on. Cut. The helmet is on the wrong side.

My family says my boyfriend must be of the same social rank. I forgot the lines. I'm sorry, director. You're not going anywhere. I'll punish you really hard tonight. No, please let me go. I'll do anything. You'll do anything? That's perfect. No. No. No.
