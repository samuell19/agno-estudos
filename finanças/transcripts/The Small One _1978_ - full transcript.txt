Wake up, Small One. You don’t want father to catch you sleeping again. Kinda stiff, huh ? How’s that ? Better ? [ Giggle ] He-haw. - He-haw. - He-haw. All right, I’m coming. Umph. So you want to play ? Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha. [ Chickens Clucking ] [ Panting ] [ Giggle ] You better not get tired out. Come on, son. We have to get to work. - Eat your breakfast. - Are those donkeys ready ? Coming, Father. Hurry, Small One. Come on ! Don’t you have enough work without doing Small One’s ? Oh, no, Father. It’s no trouble at all. Son, are you aware that Small One... eats as much as the other donkeys ? Well, he has a big appetite. That’s what I’m trying to say, son. He can no longer carry... a big enough load to pay for his food. He’s just a little tired today. His strength will come back. No. He’s old, my son. His strength is gone. We... can’t afford to keep him any longer. No, Father. You don’t mean that. I’m sorry, but tomorrow I must... take Small One to town and sell him. He’ll bring a piece of silver. No, Father. No ! [ Crying ] You can’t sell him. You can’t ! Please, son, try to understand. Small One is old. He shouldn’t have to work so hard. In the city he’ll have an easier life. You must be strong, my son. Father ? Yes, son ? Please, can I take him ? Very well. You can leave in the morning, and be home by nightfall. But understand, Small One must be sold. Yes, Father. Don’t worry, Small One, you won’t have to carry those heavy sticks. I won’t sell you to just anyone. He’ll be someone special... who will feed you, and brush your coat, and take the burrs out of your tail.

Don’t be nervous. Try and keep them straight, Small One. Hello ? [ Bubble, Bubble ] Hello ? [ Bubble, Bubble ] [ Grinding Noise ] Yes ? You have a donkey to sell ? His name... is Small One. - One piece of silver. - Will you take good care of him ? I only want his hide, boy. I’m the tanner. [ Gasp ] The tanner ? Baa. You want to make leather out of him ? One piece of silver. No, I won’t sell him ! I won’t ! No ! No ! He-haw ! He-haw ! He-haw ! I’m sorry, Small One. [ Crowd Noise ] Heh-heh.

We’ve gotta fix you up. Try and keep it straight. Fifty pieces of silver ? Are you all blind ? This is a magnificent animal. How can you pass up a bargain like this ? I need 55. I must have 55 ! I won’t let this gorgeous creature go... for less than 55. 55 ! 55 is the bid. Thank you, my friend. Now could I hear 60 ? 60 would be music to my ears. Ah, 60 ! 60 pieces of silver ! Do I hear more ? Very well. 60 once, 60 twice, sold to that lucky buyer over there... for 60 pieces of silver ! Now gentlemen, this next animal will truly amaze you. A fine steed of great breeding, - so rare, so -- - [ Laughter ] What ? Hey, you there, boy, get off. I have no time for this ! Go away, boy. Please, sir, this donkey’s for sale. This is a horse market, boy ! I haven’t time to waste on a scrawny donkey ! He’s not scrawny. He’s a strong donkey. He’s gentle and kind, and good enough to be in a king’s stable ! "A king’s stable," did you say ? Did you hear that, gentlemen ? It seems we have the prince of donkeys with us. The prince. Ha-ha. Yes, take note of this... well-muscled animal, the alert stance and deep heart. Gentlemen, do not hesitate. Ha-ha-ha. Who will start the bidding... at 1000 pieces of silver ?Ha-ha ! But look closely, my friends, and you will observe the sleekest of hides, and the tail-- ha-ha-ha. This is a tail ? Stop it. Let go of his tail ! I assure you, gentlemen, he is as strong as a bull. - He-haw ! - Get off him ! Get up, get up. Ha-ha-ha. - Move, move ! - Get off him. Get off ! What a donkey ! The king’s donkey. Ha-ha-ha. Oh ? Oh ! Ahhh ! [ Laughter ] Get that... miserable beast out of here ! Gentlemen, now that we have had our fun... and disposed of the king’s donkey, I wish to direct your attention... to a truly amazing animal. I’m sorry, Small One. [ Crying ] Tell me, son, are you the owner of this small donkey ? I need a gentle donkey... to carry my wife to Bethlehem. Is he for sale ? Yes, sir. What do you call him ? - Small One. - Small One ? Well, he looks strong enough. And kind. [ Chuckle ] I can only offer you one silver coin. I know that’s very little. That’s fine. I just want Small One to have a good home. Well, my son, he will have. [ Chuckle ] Ah, there. I’ll take good care of him. Goodbye, Small One. Be strong and sure of foot, and follow your new master. Come along, Small One. Come along.
