The people of the world are more or less the same. Though we may come in different shapes and colors, we all share the same inheritance. And we all have our backstories and our secrets. And so has Agnes, walking her dogs on the beach. Soon her life will change, and the past will become the present, again. Even though evolution might seem to mature us, there are still parts of our brain that belong to our reptile ancestors. Although we've convinced ourselves that hate, revenge, and nemesis belong to the past, our ancient ancestors' blood still runs in our veins, whether we like it or not. Clara and Thomas... are coming Thursday. Will you be home then? I'm in Altmaar on Thursday. Oh, yes. Damn. Maybe it's just for the best. Can't you just tell me his name? The man that you love. His name's Erich Neumann-Hansen, and he's sitting right here next to me. Do you want another painkiller? I don't want anything. The doctor said you can take as many as you want. I just want you to be happy. I want you to feel okay. And I don't want you to argue. I just find it strange... the way they start turning up now. It's all that matters to me, darling. That you don't argue. I don't argue. I know. Do you want me to prepare some food for Thursday? Thomas can bring some Thai. I love you. I know. Keats, Byron. He always just... money, money, money. He lives, breathes, sleeps money. So I said to him, "Sure. You've got the money, Frank. But you can't buy talent." At least not your own. Sorry. - Am I right? - Yes, definitely. Oh, we need more wine in here. More wine, Henny. Henny? Right. Where was I? Uh, love and talent. You can't do that. I hate it like that. I'm not going. Simple as that. You would've done the same. And then, then they wanted to transfer me to the head office in London, and then the shit hit the fan. I mean, I just thought, "No, not doing that. I've had enough." Career change for me, within 12 months, I bought this beautiful home. I just said, "No, that's it. You can take your job and you can stick it up your ass. I'm gonna be one of the best TV producers in Europe." - How old are the girls now? - Rea is ten and Betty is eight. Oh, big girls now. Haven't seen them in years. How are things for you? - For me? - Are you working at all? I've a... I've got a few things in the pipeline but nothing set in stone as yet. I'm just the same. I don't take anything for granted. So shall I come pick you up later after riding, Betty? I can take the bus. Okay. So, I'll see you at dinner, all right? Come on, Betty. We have to run. - Bye, Mom. - Kiss goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. We can't accept that. No. Not a chance. Well, then I'll put Vera Kaufmann on it instead. Yeah. Well, you know what that means, don't we? So, do me favor, give her a call, or even... All right. Well, you stay strong, Agnes. I'm so sorry. God bless you. I'll go with Thomas instead. So, see you there? Yes. Suit yourself. Keep the... What are you talking about? Keep everything, and then you could actually get a separate house there and there. We could build two more houses. That's a horrible idea. We could easily get part of the commission. - We're very close... - No. It feels so strange now that Dad's not here. How does it feel for you to be completely alone in this big house? I'm not alone. Byron, Keats, food. What... what difference does it make if I take it now or later? It's mine anyway. Let's wait until evaluation. Fine, fine. "And thus it follows that the estate, both banking deposits and property with its inventory in Maardam, shall be divided into two equal parts. The first part will go to my children, Clara and Thomas, and the other part to my wife, Agnes. Being of sound mind, memory, and understanding, Erich Neumann-Hansen." But hang on. What happened to the property being left in marital trust? According to the law, if we were both your children, that would be the case, but it just so happens that we're not. Luckily... for us. Now, I know that these things can take some time, but... both Clara and I would appreciate it if all of this could be over and done with as soon as possible. Clara. We'll stay in touch. I know you want to stay in this house, Agnes. I know. But surely there's nothing to prevent you from buying them out. Neither Clara nor Thomas seem to want the house anyway. How can I ever afford to on my salary? I had lunch with Susanne Liebermann today. - Oh? - Yeah. And it got a bit embarrassing when she asked if you got that part. What part? That's exactly what I said. Apparently, you told her that you had a gig on the go. Now, this autumn. It wouldn't have hurt to tell me, would it? I felt like a right idiot. Okay. - "Okay"? - What do you want me to say? Well, what gig would it be, then? You know we're opening a new office in Munich. I'm gonna be gone most of the autumn. Henny? - Henny? - Don't you get it? What is there to get? That things aren't so fucking easy for me. What do you suggest I should have said then? I'm going to bed. Peter's a bastard. You don't love him anymore. It's not that simple. Get a life of your own, a job at the very least. Divorce that waste of space. Come on, it's not like he can't afford it. You've always been so crass. I was at a funeral the other day. Anything for your own amusement. His name was Erich Neumann-Hansen. Erich Neumann-who? He was married to Agnes. Agnes? Your Agnes? Shit. How was she? I don't know. What, you didn't ask her? Not really. What's wrong with you? You know, I never understood what happened between you two. Just to the right, just yellowish-brownish one. Yes, I see it. Very yellowish-brownish. That's a Sphyrapicus varius. It's impossible. It's on the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean. - Somebody pinch me. - No fucking way. What the hell is he doing here? Have you seen any others, any females? No. Cornell are gonna hear about this. Please, don't fly away now. It doesn't look bothered. It's fucking brilliant. From now on, you better come along every time, Agnes. Ah. Agnes... Agnes, are you paying attention? Yes. Sphyrapicus varius. Shh. Shut up. Also known as the yellow-bellied sapsucker. - Shit! - Oh. Are you nuts? Do you realize what you've just done? - No. - What's going on? Better ask Agnes. Well, it turned out to be a very yellow-bellied, yellow-bellied sapsucker. - Did you get him? - No. Shit. Well, maybe it was just a... a larger than normal penduline tit or something. No way. It was far too big to be a tit. But Ansgar, darling, you told me tits could never be too big. For years, they've been complete strangers, but ever since Erich's diagnosis, it feels like they can't get enough of the place. I think they'll get it, and I'll be homeless. Thomas seems to have a heart of stone. No wonder he's an up-and-coming lawyer. And Clara, I don't know. Tsk. She never puts her foot down. A real yellow-belly. Proper yellow-bellied sapsucker. She's a sap, all right. How about you? How are things? Are you still in Grothenburg? Yeah, I... I haven't worked in ages. I've been looking after the girls, and Peter's always tied up with something. What is he up to these days? He has a big production company. They make film and TV. Sorry. May I have some more wine, please? - Yes, yes, of course. - Thank you. I think Peter's cheating on me. Oh. I'm sorry. Do you know who? I don't want to know. Here we are. And anything for yourself? - No, thank you. - Okay, enjoy. Thank you. My car's over there. I'm on my bike. It's been a long time. Can't we see each other again soon? Yes, maybe. Okay. I'll be in touch. Okay. I'm starving. I need meat. Student loan gets paid out on Monday. Agnes, if you hadn't gone and spoiled everything, we could all be tucking into a flame-grilled, yellow-bellied sapsucker by now. You really have the ability to string out a joke. Apart from Ansgar, of course, who might prefer to get his teeth stuck into a big tit. Ouch. - Did you grab it? - What? The bird watching notes. No. I thought you got them. - Oh, shit! - Can you drive us home, please? Henny, I thought you were gonna stay at my place tonight. I'm sorry, darling. All this excitement's really taken it out of me. Me too. We'll drop you off by the Botanical Gardens. What? Seriously, Henny, we can't go on like this. I know. How did we end up with the biggest pair of tits in town? Speaking of tits, look what I have. - Hmm? - Oh, you beauty. I love you for this. Let's hide it. It's getting dark. Let's hide it. Here in the park. Here. Erich, he moved back from Kaalbringen after his divorce. His father had just died, so... he inherited the house. Let's go. Go! It's... Peter. Really, I know I should leave him. I mean, he's chosen someone else over me. Probably been several over the years. What do I know? But I can't... deal with it. For some reason, I just... can't. Ahem. You know, I actually began to envy you. What if it was me who'd been left widowed instead? What if I had been you? If Peter happened to get a terminal illness... leukemia, like Erich. Can you hear what you're saying? I even think it'd be easier for the kids. I can't quite let go of that feeling. The envy and how much easier everything would be. Christ, Henny. Is this some sort of fantasy, or is it just one of your sick jokes? Have you seen the film Strangers on a Train? Hitchcock. Two people meet on a train, and they make a deal that each one will commit a murder on behalf of the other. Swap murders, both with watertight alibis. Why are you telling me this? Because I realize I'm the first person they'd suspect. Suspect? Oh... So now you want me to kill your husband. I've been thinking since we last saw each other. You need cash, right? Well, money isn't a problem. After Mom's will, I... Tell me you're fucking joking. If you do this for me, I'll make sure you can keep the house. No one would suspect you. You're sick. Please, Agnes! Get help! Henny! My time has finally come. Say hello, to the new Cordelia! Cordelia? Is Groschmann doing Lear? Yeah. He's here now! - Here? - Yes. - Where? - Oh, fuck off! He arrived yesterday. And next week, they're holding auditions at the Kellerteater! So, you have to help me, Henny. I really want to get this part. So, you have to do lines with me. I'll do anything for you. You know that. I mean, he's Mr. "Everything I Touch Turns into Gold" Groschmann. So, this is a chance of a lifetime. You've met him, haven't you? What's he like? Wow. We had a wonderful night. Like one of these nights where two souls merge into one. - Oh, stop! - And then... Stop! No, we only had half an hour together during that interview, but... he's special, you know? - Mm-hmm. - He sort of stays with you. Ready? "If he be taken, I shall nevermore be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose. How in my strength you please. For you, Edmond." "In the good man is distress. Seek, seek for him..." - "Lest his..." - "Lest his..." "Ungoverned rage dissolve the life." "Ungoverned rage dissolve the life." Ahem. "News, madam. The British powers are marching hitherward." When I saw you in Cafe Intrigo, it was as if time had stood still. And I realized how much I've missed you. Your laughter. Your way of telling a story. You're one in a million, Agnes. I've understood that you're not interested in my proposal, and I respect that. But I hope you might still want to see me, and that, just maybe, you've missed me, too. I'll never forget that year we spent together in Frau Bloeme's house. Me, struggling with my boring Sociology, and you with your Literature, longing for your family back in Italy. Although it was tough for both of us, it was the happiest time of my life. Shh. Dear Agnes, couldn't we just start over? "...furrow-weeds, with burr-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn. A century send forth. Search every acre in the high-grown field, and bring him to our eye. What can a man's wisdom..." Sorry, sorry, I forgot. Um, this is when the officer exits. "What can a man's wisdom, in his bereaved..." Hold on a minute. Um, now he's gone. Um, would she carry on in exactly the same way? What do you mean? I think there can be some kind of break here. Well, I'm doing the audition, not you, and I want Cordelia to be strong. Surely she can be strong without talking in such a loud voice. Yes, but it's a classical theatrical text, so it's crying out to be interpreted. And we're not doing documentary for the History Channel. All right. I just meant you could find a slightly different... And surely that's why Groschmann is coming here. To see how Cordelia can be interpreted, right? - Yeah. But... - And this is my interpretation. I mean, I hope I'm better than Louise. - God, yes. - And that other girl. - Are they auditioning as well? - Yeah. - They are. - Hmm. But it could be interesting, I guess, for Groschmann. I mean, Louise has, given talentlessness, a brand-new face, no? - Put it on the map. - Raised the bar. - That low. - That low. You have to come along tomorrow for moral support. - Of course I will. - Thank you. Think he'll remember me? Who? Groschmann. You know, I heard he came here only to be close to you. He couldn't get Henny Delgado out of his head. So, the play at the Kellerteater is all because of you. I believe it. Hello? Johann Clausen. Real estate agency. It's nice to meet you. What a fantastic place you have here. It's totally unique. I can just imagine the bidding this place would attract. Hello, Agnes. I'm just going to look outside. Thomas. Agnes is here now. You know, I almost worked that out entirely by myself. Agnes? I'm just wondering what kind of timeframe we're working with. When do you want this in the market? The most important thing is that we get the highest price for it. The highest price, as soon as possible. When are you guys ready to... ready to move? - Now. - Now? And so apart from deductions for loans and other costs, you'll have to pay Clara and Thomas 500,000 Euro if you want to buy them out. Give or take 20,000, depending on the new valuation. I cannot manage that. I spoke to the bank yesterday. I'm sorry, Agnes. This is just how things stand. You-you have to understand the children as well. They don't want to wait for their money. Yes. So I understand. Please wait a few days... before telling them. Okay. - I will call you. - When you're ready. - Peter? - Hmm? I'd like to start over. Move to a bigger town, where I can find a job. Get to know some new people. Hey... Maybe you could run the new office. I always wanted to live in Munich. I'll talk to Gosser. He owes me a favor anyway. Maybe he can get you into something here. Karl-Heinz Theater. Why don't you just hire a professional if you have so much money? Why come to me? Actually, it's completely on impulse. I was thinking of that film and how we could actually help each other. How much are you prepared to pay? How much do you want? Three-hundred thousand, minimum. I'll give you 400, minimum. This is really insane, Henny. Fine. How do you imagine this can be done? Let's go outside. He looks just the same... despite everything. There are more pictures inside. You have to know what he looks like nowadays. I have an identical one. I've put prepaid cards on both and saved our numbers. You mustn't use it for anything else. Okay. An advance. A hundred and fifty grand. I'll be in touch about dates and all that, okay? Yes. Ooh. After returning to England in 1811, he got down to work on what would eventually become Childe Harold. What would you say sets this work apart? I think it was written in Spenserian meter. And what is that? Old metrical form. How old? 1600s? 1500s. Iambic pentameter followed by a single alexandrine. Are you all right? You'll have to excuse me. - Yes. - I can't do it. This is madness. I couldn't live with myself. - If that's how you feel. - Yes, that's how I feel. - Right. It was a stupid idea. - Yes, it was. - So forget about it then. - Good. We'll forget it ever came up, Henny. Okay. Just give me your bank account and I'll... I'll return your money. No, no. That won't work. It would look very strange. I had to mess about quite a bit to take out that much cash. So what do we do? Next Thursday at 11:00, the Motorway Service Cafe. Can you make it? I'll manage. Oh, by the way, I had a chat with Gosser. He's practically gave me his word that he'd get you a part. Some Ibsen play or something. I thought you'd be happy. What? Because you persuaded a mate of yours to get me a minor part in some play you don't even know the title of? Anyone else would leap at the opportunity. Not me. So call him and tell him it's off then, yeah? Yeah. I don't need your help. Suit yourself. Oh, you really do have green fingers, or whatever it's called. Thank you. So... I have the valuation. A little bit more than we expected. It's quite a bit more, actually. I want you to leave. This is still my house and my garden. Agnes, half of this is still yours. The other half belongs to me and to Clara. Very soon now, the whole house is going to be sold. I said go away. Do you think I don't know? Do you think I don't know how you used my dad, that you were seeing others from the very second you knew he was terminally ill? I don't understand why he didn't kick you out. And who would've looked after him in his final days? You and Clara? You know nothing about what Erich and I had together. I know that you never loved my dad. I'm picking up my photo albums from my childhood. They're hardly yours, are they? No. I want to keep the house. In that case, we have to continue with our plan. No more messing about. But how do we do it? What's your thinking? It feels so unreal, somehow. Do you remember the bird link? Ansgar and... Klaus-Joseph. I'll see you there in 45 minutes. Turnoff towards the little bridge. I inherited them from dad. I think they're from the war. Anyway, impossible to trace. Mm-hmm. So you want me to shoot him? It's completely up to you. Rather do it another way, that's fine by me. No, no. It's fine. I've never handled a gun. Nor have I. Well, hardly. It can't be that difficult. You'll have to practice... in a forest or something. Yeah. Peter is always going off on conference trips. So, I'll check his calendar. It has to be synchronized with what I'm doing. - Mm-hmm. - Need a watertight alibi. I can't just be home with the children. That wouldn't be enough. Look, Henny... why don't you just leave him? It doesn't make sense. It doesn't. Because I know deep down that's exactly what he wants me to do. And I'm not gonna give him the satisfaction. And you? How did it go for you? Yeah. He didn't get it at all. He thought it was going great. Same thing with Ansgar. Clueless, basically. Two tequilas, salt and lemon. Good day for tequila. Yes. Like that, it is. We have to celebrate, don't we? Finally, it's just the two of us. Mm. Pity we're not gay. - Mm... - Imagine how much easier life would be. But I love you. You know that. Yeah, of course. And I love you. Voilá. Thank you. Come on, then. We should go away together once all this is over. Italy, maybe. Firenze. Now we won't see each other for a bit. I'll wait till you've gone. "Tis known before. Our preparation stands in expectation of them. O dear father! It is thy business that I go about. Therefore great France... my mourning and important tears hath pitied. No blown ambition doth our arms incite. But love, dear love and our ag'd father's right. Soon may I hear and see him." Bravo. It's, uh, um... It's Agnes, isn't it? Yes. And you did Masha in The Three Sisters? Yes, last spring. Did you like her? I liked her very much. Both her and the role. Chekhov, eh? The man who wouldn't listen to his doctors. It's a bit too mainstream for me, but great fun, I'm sure. Thank you. And thank you all, ladies, for wonderful performances. It's just too bad there can be only one Cordelia. I'll let you know either way tomorrow morning. Noon at the latest. That's a wrap. Oh, yes, and before you leave, anyone interested in reading for Goneril or Regan, be here tomorrow evening, filling that. Thanks, again. Terrific stuff. Terrific. So you've met him before, right? Interviewed him for the student magazine last year. Yeah. He's just amazing. Not that ugly either. Yeah, that's true. Do you guys wanna tag along for beer? - Sure. - I don't know about you, - I think I need three. - Let's go. Come on. - Oh, come on. - Yeah. Of course. Yes. I don't think I did very well, you know. Oh, no, you were great. Well, hardly made much of an impression there. - He didn't recognize you? - Not in the least. Even though I gave him my most winning smile. Christ. What a drag. Still, you did Cordelia the way you see her. What do you mean, the way I see her? How else should I have done it? No, I just meant you can afford to be proud of yourself. Hey, let's go to Gunthers. That's a good idea. Do you wanna come? Come on, let's go. Come on, let's have a beer. I don't know. I think I'll head off home. Yeah, right. Stop messing about. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. I'm gonna go. Okay? Okay. Oh, come on... Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Hey, ladies. - Yes. - Hello. - Hi. Have you decided? Mm... mm-mm. You have a good look. - For Cordelia. - Thank you. Would you like a glass of wine? Red or white? - Red. - Excuse me. Yes, please. Can we have two glasses of red, please? Yes. Aww, it's closed, guys. So where do we go now? So... do you intend on pursuing it? - The theater? - Yeah. Maybe. I guess stranger things have happened. Then I'll speak to some people. Give you some names, good names, good schools. If you're interested, I mean. Yes, I really am. Thank you. Would you like to do all sorts of acting... television, film, theater? I like theater. You prefer theater? Oh, wow, that's really... This is a really nice place. Well done. You know, we could go out back somewhere. Think I just changed my mind. - Can I have a drag? - Sure. You can't stay, you know. I've got a big day tomorrow. I need to sleep. And as long as you're in touching distance, that's gonna make it very difficult. Absolutely. Do you know I've been approached many times to direct at the Kellerteater? It's never quite worked out. I'm glad it has this time, though. This is the first time Shakespeare's ever been done there, you know that? So you'll be in touch tomorrow? Before 12:00. Promise. Hi, this is Peter Groschmann. I can't come to the phone right now so please leave a message. On the balcony? Why? Oh, hold on a second. Yes, dear? You seen Henny today? Uh, uh, she left in a hurry a couple of hours ago. And what happened then? What was he doing there then? God... It's half past 1:00. Why haven't you called? Ah, sorry, I had to make some chops and changes this morning. Really? Have you decided? Yes, I have, actually. It's Henny Delgado here. But we really need a Goneril, so maybe you can play that part. You're gonna need to... Agnes? Okay. We'll be rehearsing daytimes for the first three weeks, and then a week before, get in the theater... Agnes? Yes, she left. I'm as surprised as you are, dear. She packed everything in an hour. I asked her if something had happened, but she just thanked me for everything, and then she was on her way. Well, I think it's almost too good to be true. But I've done my sums, and it's going to be fine. Excellent. Who would ever have thought a banker was capable of changing his mind? One would think it was against their nature. As I said earlier, Clara and Thomas want this whole thing to be over and done with as soon as possible. The transaction has to be finalized at the end of the month. At the end of the month. Good. I'll let the bank know. And I will speak to the children. "In her first passion, a woman loves her lover, and all the others, all she loves is love." Thank you. "A mistress never is nor can be a friend. While you agree, you are lovers. And when it is over, anything but friends." Morning. - I would like to buy a wig. - Okay. Shh. There will be, like, eight of us, and remember, Wasserman's a vegetarian so you might have to make a salad or something. Yes, I know. I can make a gratin. And then there's a conference in Linden, 25th, 26th, 27th. Might have to go in the 24th, but I won't know until a week before. And where will you be staying? Silverling House, I presume. That's where she usually books me into. Why do you ask? I just want to know where you are. That's the same weekend I'll be at that workshop in Saarendorf. What workshop? Fine, I'll talk to Benji. The girls could stay with him while I'm away. And then it's Vienna. I know. Exactly. I'll just be getting home and then I'll have to leave again. I tried to cancel it this year, but they didn't want to listen. They were planning to do some sort of... I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say that it's excellent news that Agnes has managed to persuade her bank. We all know how much Agnes loves this marvelous house, and how difficult it would be for her to be parted from it. It's also very pleasing that Clara and Thomas can now take possession of their legacy. The final payment to the respective accounts will be transferred by the end of next month. Thank you, Martin. Right. Well, I think that wraps things up for today. Wanna play, Dad? Another time. When he comes, I leave. Take it easy, sis. All right. So I walk in, and you're on your way out. Got a home to take care of. I'll see you on the weekend of 25th-26th. Absolutely. Maybe you should have married your brother instead. Wolfgang! It's been a while. Yeah, yeah. Of course. - Have you got a pen and paper? - Yes. Silverling House Hotel in Linden. Hm, I'll find it. Near the conference center. It's walking distance, so probably no taxi. Uh-huh. Okay. There'll be opportunities. They usually keep going till fairly late in the day, so it'll be dark. And where will you be? I'll be at a workshop in Saarendorf. I've borrowed a flat on Parkstraat, a little back street behind the railway station. They're called Wittgenstein. Like the philosopher. Exactly. I'm immersing myself in the noble art of acting. - What are your dogs called? - What? What are your dogs called? Well, I call them Ms. Keats and Mrs. Byron. When everything is over, send me a text, "Keats and Byron". I'll send you a text, "Keats and Byron". Bye. Bye. Keats? Byron? - Here. - Thank you. Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow. No problem, at all. - Hello, Agnes. - Hello. I just want you to... Well, I wanted to apologize about Thomas. I know he can be a bit of an asshole. But I'm not Thomas, and I wish we'd be friends, you and I. - Do you? - I know how much you meant to Dad, how much he loved you. I know that. And in a way, I'm glad you're staying at grandfather's house. It's sort of continuity. It's sort of still there. And one can come here, part of one's growing up. And I know that's what dad would have wanted, for you stay on here and we be friends. But it hasn't been easy for me either. Yes. I can understand that, Clara. And it's fine. - Are you going somewhere? - No. Not really. I appreciate you coming. I want you to know that. And I'm sure Erich would have, too. Sorry. I'm a bit in a hurry. No, of course. See you, then. Thanks. Shit. Come on, girls. So I'll see you after the weekend then. - Well, what's that? - It's a slide. How are things with you? - That's so cool! - Pass. Fine. I'm just a bit nervous about all of this, you know. Out of practice, to say the least. It'll be fine. I dropped it. Pick it up. Hey, budge over. Come on, gang. Let's get out of here. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, Mom. Hello? Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I'll be there... Well, there you are. So what about the house? Do you think you'll be able to keep it? Endless conversations with the bank. You know, I'd like to help, but it's just impossible. - I can't. - I know. But it will work out fine. You know, Henny's at some sort of workshop in Kaalbringen. Or is it Saarendorf? I can't remember. Anyway, she'll be gone all weekend. Maybe we can meet somewhere tomorrow? I have to get back to the dogs. We can maybe be in touch tomorrow. Absolutely. Inside. If you touch the gun, I'll shoot. I said inside. Drop the bag. We're leaving here soon. You can take a seat for now. How long have you been planning this? Ever since I realized it was you. Peter doesn't love anyone. He can't love anyone. Not even his own children. That doesn't mean I think it's okay that you're fucking him, like some sort of revenge for something that happened years ago. But why this playing games? I think I have a bit too much time on my hands. - Huh? - And also I was curious how far you were prepared to go. But what if I had done it? What if I had shot him? I took a chance. And I was right, wasn't I? Because of what happened in the stupid theater. You just can't move on, can you? Okay, you hated me then. I can understand that. But that was over ten fucking years ago, and you still want to kill me. And you, me, apparently. It took a bit of money, but it was worth it. You're sick. When things calm down out there, we'll go for a drive. So when the funeral and all of that crap was out of the way... Peter would just move into your perfect little home? With a room each for the girls, of course. You know, why not convert the loft? Did you really think he'd want that? That you mean so much to him? The truth is... that he doesn't mean anything to me. It's not my fault that he doesn't love you. You're smart, you're beautiful, and I even think you're funny. So I never understood why Peter doesn't love you. And he doesn't offer me any clues. I mean, I've asked him, all right. But you know how he is. He zones out. I actually feel sorry for him. We have two children together. What fucking right do you have to destroy that? He's the one who came crawling to me for consolation, and you're the one who wants me to kill him. You should be grateful, Henny. If I hadn't been there, he would have left you long ago. Hello? Yeah. What, now? What... what time is it? Why? What's happened? No, no, no. That's okay. It's okay. Boat? What boat? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah. Half an hour? Yeah, yeah, I can be there. But... but what's going on? What the hell's happened? Benji? It's been a while. Can I come in? Please. It's been difficult on the girls, but possibly hardest for Henny. Yes, I can understand. But you know what she's like... sort of proud, strong. The police even suspected her at one point. That she was involved somehow, or even done it herself. And then on top of that, all the hearsay and gossip. So many of her friends who turned their back on her, if you want to call them friends. She must have felt very alone in all this. I can imagine, yes. I'd like to ask a favor of you. I know it was a long time ago, but for Henny's sake... It's over. - Glass of wine? - Champagne? Or maybe... Two tequilas for the two ladies outside.
