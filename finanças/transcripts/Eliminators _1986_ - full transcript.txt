Mayday, mayday. 81 degrees, 14 minutes West, 26 degrees, 32 minutes North. Mayday, mayday. 81 degrees, 14 minutes West, 26 degrees, 32 minutes North. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! - More frequency. - Careful. Give that to me. It's coming in. We've succeeded. Only if he's brought proof. He's coming to. He seems to be all right. Congratulations, Mr. Reeves. Help the mandroid from the cage, Takada. 1st Century, B.C. Mm-hmm. A Roman Centurion shield no less. Magnificent. - How do you feel? - Disoriented. Did it work? Was I there? Yes. You don't remember? No. Just burning light, flashes. I was in my plane going down again. There must be more. I had some trouble with this. It feels like a delay in the neuro-synapse trigger. Ah. Minor adjustment. We'll run a full system check. Takada. Send the mandroid to the maintenance lab. I wish to speak with you. You've done well, my friend. Takada...... Yes, I have no further use for the mandroid. Remove its memory and dismantle it. We can't! He's long since dead, Takada. He's a machine. His brain, it's half human. Alive! For God's sake, show some compassion. May I remind you that we have been dissecting the very building blocks of the universe. Since when have we been concerned with compassion? What compassion was ever shown to me? Hm? Bring me its memory, Takada. Come with me. Reeves ordered me to dismantle you. We must escape this place tonight. I'll need my mobile unit. How could you turn against me, Takada? Drop your weapon at once! Mandroid, activate your laser and kill Dr. Takada. Please, no. You cannot resist your programming, Mandroid. No, no. - Oh, no! - No, no! Come on, let's go! Takada! Reeves must be stopped. - I'll finish him right now. - No... Warn Colonel Hunter. Reeves based research-- ' Reeves! Reeves! ' ' Ugh! Gimme that damn rifle. Now I got you, you tin can son of a bitch. You got him, Ray! - You got him! - He ain't down yet. Shit. Damn! Get the men together, Luis. Can you read me now, SPOT? Okay. Initiate primary cycle. Stop complaining, just do it. Hey, Chief. Chief! - Chief. - Huh? Got a power surge on the east vents. - So? - Shouldn't we check it out? Nah, it's a cat or something. I'm gonna take a look anyway. Suit yourself, partner. You see what happens when you show off? Jesus. Chief, somebody broke through the fence. I'm heading for the East Wing now. Chief, do you copy? Chief. Take off the headphones, damn it! Chief! What's wrong, SPOT? - Slow down. Where? - Now be quiet. - Power off, SPOT. Ow! I'm looking for Colonel Hunter. You've found her. How did you get past security? Knockout gas. - What do you want? - Your help. All right. Just who the hell are you? - Who did this to you? - Abbott Reeves. - Reeves? - About a year ago, my plane went down in the Mexican wilderness. I was pulled half-dead from the wreck and taken upriver. When I came to, I found this. You arms, your leg units... It's my work, all of it. These parts were designed for a service droid on the space platform. But you're human. Yes. Hold on. Reeves died five years ago. No, he's prolonged his life with grafting and transplants. This whole lab is funded by the Reeves foundation, now you tell me that Reeves is still alive, and what's more he's stolen my designs and bastardized them. No offense. None taken. I know what I am. And I know what I have to do: Return to Mexico and kill Abbott Reeves. Your cortex relay is shorting. Can you fix it? Come over to the work table, I'll have a look. You mentioned a plane crash. You were a pilot? I don't remember. My life before the crash is a blank. I'm not surprised. You weren't given much memory storage. And the plates you do have were cracked by a bullet. You're functioning primarily on your human brain. Can we keep it that way? Sure. Are you okay? Yes, sometimes I have these hallucinations. I don't know why. Look, I want to go to Mexico with you. - No. - You don't understand. Reeves has taken my life's work. I've got to find out what he's doing with it. Goodbye, Colonel Hunter. You need a full-time mechanic, my friend. All right. It's your life. I brought along a piece of equipment that might come in handy. What is it? Search, Patrol, and Operational Tactician. SPOT for short. Sort of an electronic scout. I designed it for Air Force Rescue Teams. It's too shiny to be sneaking around the woods with us. Hey, man, you need some body work? You talking to me? No, he means the car. All right! Hold it right there! Come on, let's go. You're the one who'll need body work. Hey, cut that out! John, I'd like you to-- Shut him down, will you? SPOT, power off. I've marked the coordinates you remembered from the crash. 81 degrees, 14 minutes West. 26 degrees, 32 minutes North. We'll have to hire a boat and a guide. No guide. There's 70 miles of uncharted river between here and there. - I found my way out. - Sure. But could you find your way back? Harry, you could buy a beer. De vez en cuando. Carlos, you know I don't drink. Besides, it's hot out there. I need my salt. Hey, Fontana! Oh, Christ. I've had about enough of you and your low-down undercuttin', and 50's everyone else here on this river. Well, everyone on the river's wrong, Betty. I make an honest buck. Then how come is it I got me the best damn boat on this river and I still can't catch me no business. I don't know. Why don't you look in the mirror? Why, for two centavos-- Not here, Betty! You lowlife river rat, the next time you cross my path-- Ah. Mm. I need a boat and a man who can take me up the river. Que Linda chamaca! Do you speak English? Lo Que usted desee. What do you want, senhorita? I want the toughest guide in the place. Harry Fontana, king of the wild frontier? Mr. Fontana... This is my friend, John. We never discussed another passenger. Kind of hot for a cape, isn't it? I thought you said no questions. I lied. Good captain's gotta know his cargo. Maritime law. Okay, how much to break that law? Hmm... extra C-note for the elephant man. Get aboard. No Betty, I'm not going with you this time. - You play too rough. - Aw, Maurice, you're not still mad about that little love pat are you? I'm your best pal. Let's go, guys. Cast her off, hon'. Say your prayers, Harry Fontana. So, what are you guys after, the usual? - I don't follow. - Come on, lady. Everybody down here's after Aztec gold. Not everyone. Okay, be like that. Where you from, pal? You know your partner's a barrel of laughs. Listen, John was seriously hurt in a plane crash. Oh, I get it. Survivor's return to the crash site? What for? Now don't tell me. Don't tell me, let me guess. Dope, artifacts... Diamonds? Is that it, diamonds? Well, listen. It don't matter, because you got the best salvage man in the business standing right here, for a little bit of change of course. I remember the wreck of the Santo Domingo. We're being followed. - God damn it! - Who are they? Just a couple of river scum trying to horn in on my action. Count again. Can you lose them? I'm gonna try. Gimme them binoculars. It's no use, you stink weasel! I want them fares and I want them now! We've no time for this. Ah! Fontana, maybe we can buy them off or something. - Pull over! - Relax, they're harmless. Jesus! Hey, bud, take this wheel! - No, I'll do it. - No way! You think just 'cause I'm a woman, - I can't pilot this wreck? - That's right. That's wrong. Let her drive. All right, fine. Drive. What are you doing? Saw this in a movie once. Gimme them binoculars. What the hell? Hold on, Maurice! All right! You didn't have to blow them up! I just dumped them overboard. Besides, they tried to shoot me. Slow down. This is what you hired me for. You weren't hired to kill us. Will you quit complaining? I stopped them, didn't I? Then ease up. Your engine sounds like it might blow. You're the boss. Now what? Maybe I can help you. Oh sure, give me that toolbox over there, will you? No, I mean work on the engine. Right, right. Just get me a screwdriver out of there, please. I do know something about mechanics. Ow! You wanna fix the motor? Please, go ahead, fix the motor! Oh, shit! What's the matter, Fontana? Your old bucket finally giving up? Come on aboard here, lamb chop, Bayou Betty won't leave you stranded for piranha bait. Betty, I've got a contract with these people. Betty earned this job with her own two fists. If you can't fix the engine, we'll have to go with them. I'd rather be piranha bait. You turn them fares over, Fontana, or I swear, I'll blow your top half clear to Texas! I'll count to five. That could take all day. One... Two... Three... Betty! Betty, look! What the hell? Do you have any alcohol aboard? Yeah, yeah. Hey, wait a minute-- what-- Oh, Mon Dieu! Are there really piranhas around here? Nah, just snapping turtles. Huh? Now what's wrong? You think I'm blind? I saw that torpedo. Who are you guys? What the hell are you up to? We just saved your life. What do you want, a medal? We're floating right here until I get some answers. All right. How much money do you want? It's not the money, it's you, damn it! Me? You wreck a bar just to hire a guide. Then you give me some song and dance about a plane wreck. The next thing I know, we're playing sink the Bismarck. Mandroid: Mr. Fontana... What? Shut up and drive. You got it, big guy. I been thinkin', no more boats, no more bugs, no more river. We're moving to Alaska, Maurice. - Dogsleds. Hey, hey! Maurice: Ah, Mon Dieu! Well, what happened, amigos? Some conniving water moccasin blowed my boat to splinters. With a torpedo. - Who's got torpedoes? - Harry Fontana. He's a guide, got him a crate called the No Questions. He had a girl along, and a big man. He was dressed all in black. Help us aboard there, hon'. Sure, sweet thing. By the way, where did you say that Harry Fontana went? Upriver. Muchas gracias! "Vamanos," Luis! Vamanos, Vamonos.. So, Fontana, what do you think? How much longer? - Well, you see, right here? - Mm-hmm. Well, your coordinates are Southeast of there. I'd say about two or three hours. The sun's up, let's go. Good. Hop in the boat. Just a moment. Can we get there by land? Well, you might pick out an old Indian trail in that jungle, but that's a real bad way to-- Good. Get your gear, Nora. - We're going on foot. - What? Wait a minute, why don't we take my boat? It's a whole lot faster and a lot safer. That jungle's uncharted, I wouldn't go in there. You won't have to. Your services are no longer needed. John, what are you doing? We're getting too close, Nora. We have to go alone. Too close for what? Come on, guys, fill me in. I can keep a secret. You know you're driving me crazy? I'm sorry, Fontana, but John's right. You'd better go. Now. All right, okay. You're firing me? Great. I'm outta here. It's no use. The trail's gone. That's okay. We're close enough for SPOT now. What's it gonna do? I'll feed him the location and approximate mass of the target. Hopefully, he'll find the plane and report back the best possible route. - Power on, SPOT. Are you ready for a field test? Okay, SPOT. Take off. I've seen that before. What? The colors pulsing, it's one of Reeves' experiments. Reeves was working with matter transfer? I can't remember. That's all right, John. Terrific. Buenos Dias. Hey, nice boat. Look, this is kind of embarrassing, but I think I'm lost. We'll be taking that gun. Hand it over. Why sure. Butt first. Yeah. Muchas gracias, senor. You're Fontana. Verdad?? Could be. "Quo Vadis." What's that mean? That's Italian, means "we kick ass." Oh. Now you had a couple passengers on this boat. Where they at? Come on, guys. You kill me, you'll never find out. But if you were to lay a little dinero on me, then maybe we could-- Pay the man. Why? Porque?? Because I said pay the man. Hell, you act if it's our money. Thanks a lot. I left them downriver. Now, you'll have to take a look at this map. There's this little inlet. You see right here? This is strange. I think he got stuck or something. Yeah! Ramming speed! Go, get him! Oh, no! You stupid... No, hombre! Qua vadis, boys! This looks like a hand axe. Are there still Indians out here? I don't think so. Not primitives at least. We'll have to watch ourselves, that's all. - Look! Report. He found it. That way. Just under a kilometer. Why does he keep doing that? I guess he likes you. Come on. Is that it, John? Yes. And if we follow that river, we'll find Abbott Reeves. I don't want to stop here. Let's move on. But we should search the wreckage for clues, to find out who you are, where you're from. - No. - What are you afraid of? If your past is out there, then you have to face it. I don't have to do anything. Nora, please. It's too dangerous. John! John! Hang on, Nora! I'll try and pull you up! Damn it, it's stuck! It's blocked. I can't get out! You folks having a little trouble? Nora's trapped in the wreckage. - Help her! - What's in it for me? I'm drowning in here, you pirate! I'm no pirate. I just want my share. Okay, okay, Fontana. You're in for a third of the treasure. That's a deal. You know, you really shouldn't call a man... trying to make an honest living a pirate. Go for it! You spoke too soon, lady. I'd have settled for 10 percent. What the hell is-- Never mind. I don't even want to know. Let's go. I knew you were after Aztec gold. I just knew it. That explains the salvage gear. State-of-the-art, right? That little guy... what is he, some kind of metal detector? Nothing gets past you, does it, Fontana? John? John, what's the matter? Nora: I was seeing things again. A bronze shield floating in the water, and the other hallucinations, Roman soldiers. Well, I don't know what it means, but at least your memory's improving. What's Fontana gonna do when he finds out there's no treasure? We worry about that later. He knows the terrain, we won't find Reeves without him. Hey, no secrets back there, not now that we're partners. What's up? The Indians. We found a fire pit with a jaguar carcass. Oh, no, no, no. There's no Indians out here. - Must have been hunters. What was that? SPOT says hunters skin jaguars. They don't eat them. Who knows this river? Me, or that big-mouthed, electric bowling ball? - Ow! Damn it! What's he blabbing? He says shut up and drive! Hang on, everybody. John! Oh, my God! Fontana, stop! My God, stop the boat! Nothing. - It's useless. - Then I'll try. Nora, there's 15 foot of muck at the bottom of that river. It would take a salvage rig to get him up even if I could find him. I'm sorry. I can't believe he's gone! So what do you want to do? He'd want us to keep going. It's your nickel. Woman over loudspeaker: Mr. Reeves? I told you, I was not to be disturbed. Excuse me, sir, but Ray has returned. Ray? Ah, yes. Send him in. What the hell? Report. Yeah, report. Yes, sir. Well, it's like this. There's this scumbag of a guide out there, - by the name of-- - Fontana, Senor Reeves. Yes, sir. Harry Fontana. He's out on the river, got some girl with him and some big hombre that's supposed to be able to shoot torpedoes. - The mandroid. - Yeah. It must be him, the mandroid. Well, me and Luis we was right on his tail, but then we had a little problem with Quo Vadis. What? She'll be in dry dock a couple days. You idiot. What have you done this time? Don't, Mr. Reeves. Please put me down. I can find the mandroid again, I swear it. I can pick his trail up. You had better. They mustn't reach my compound. They won't. I swear it. If you fail me again... We won't fail you, sir. We'll find him. Get out. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. We won't fail you. - Huh? - Ge! the hell out of here! - SPOT, you okay? Good. Can you locate Nora? We'll try again when you've dried out. We'll find them. "Deeper water on the western side," he said. How would we ever manage without the king of the wild frontier? Would you just give-- would you give me a break? Everybody's entitled to one mistake. Yeah. Mine was not going with Bayou Betty when I had the chance. I thought you were sharper than that. - What? - By now... Ms. Betty would have had you-- Fontana. Fontana! Fontana! You gotta be kidding. Let go of me! You've been following me. Why? To learn who you are. I have never seen anything like you and your friend. But one should expect such things from Abbott Reeves. - You've found Reeves? - No, but I am close. My father came here to work with Reeves on a secret project, and I haven't heard from him since. Are you Dr. Takada's son? Yes, the name's Kuji. Your father was the only real friend I had. Was? I'm sorry to tell you this, but he's dead. Reeves killed him. You're not the only one with a score to settle. This is the weirdest-looking bunch of Indians I've ever seen. Harry, I know it's crazy, but they look like Neanderthals. - You mean, cavemen? - Yeah. They sure are ugly enough. Okay, okay! Who's that? Must be the leader coming to greet us. - Smile... - look friendly. But don't show your teeth, it's a sign of aggression. - Uh-oh. - Hey! Fruity cavemen? Thanks, lovely. Now what? Some kind of ceremony. I wish I had a camera. A camera? I don't like the looks of that Stone Age toothpick. So how do we get away? There's too many of them. Yeah. Look... I'd just like to say, I think you're a hell of a woman. What? I just wish I'd gotten to know you better. - So... Would you kiss me good-bye? That is the cheapest line I've ever heard. Hey, I don't want that to be the last face I see. Put this in the fire. That's it, Flintstone. Ooh! - This way. - No, no, this way! Ugh... The name's Kuji. I came with John Doe. - John's alive? - Mm. SPOT! That takes care of them. Let's get out of here. You know, they don't speak English. So what? Well, why didn't you just say, "Nora, throw your bullets in the fire?" Wouldn't have gotten a free smooch. - You lousy-- - Hey! Let's get out of here while we still can, okay? Hey, look. How did you stay under that river so long? Bio-fed oxygen transcribers. Of course, silly me. "Reeves." - Nora, look out! Come on! Hold on. They can't catch us now, slow down. - I can't, malfunction. - Hold on, we're gonna hit! Is everyone okay? SPOT. Oh, swell. Our little buddy. I've lost my boat, we're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. What is this anyway? Some kind of goddamn comic book? We got robots, we got cavemen, we got kung-fu. Well, that's it, all right? I quit. Fontana! - Where are you going? - West, - till I hit civilization. - West is that way! Look, Fontana, if we don't stick together, none of us will get out of here. We need your experience. Then level with me. There's no treasure. This is all some kind of weird-ass science fiction thing, right? Right. Pull up a log, Harry. It's a long story. There, that's it. I hid this when I escaped from the compound. We're close now. What is this thing? A mobile unit. We should wait until dark. Let's camp here and plan our attack. We don't even know what we're attacking. That's easy enough. SPOT? Locate the compound. We need a full recon with strategic overlay. Whoa! What's with that guy? He's just playing. I met your father once when I was a student. I remember when he resigned from the space institute. Only when they refused to accept his ideas. But Abbott Reeves believed in his time-transfer theory. In his last letter, my father said he and Reeves designed a prototype, a machine that can travel through time. That would explain the cavemen. Reeves must have brought them here. And John, your memories. You've been to Ancient Rome. Kuji: But a breakthrough like this, - why keep it a secret? - You don't. Unless you're up to no good. Okay. Try it now. Sounds great, thanks. Hey, shut that thing down a minute. Split up! Move it! John! Over here! I'll get you, you scrap yard son-of-a bitch. Where's Nora? ls SPOT back yet? No. I'm getting worried about him. Something wrong? Nora... I want you to dismantle me. What are you talking about? The one thing that kept me alive was the desire to kill Abbott Reeves. But his death won't make me whole again. Nothing will. I'm not a man. I'm a killing machine with no past... and no future. I'd destroy myself, but my programming wouldn't allow that. So you have to do it for me. You know I wouldn't do that. Please. I've been dead for a long time. But you're not dead. All right. You are a machine. But you're still a human being. I saw the way you looked at that photograph of your wife and kid. SPOT. He's malfunctioning. I can't understand a word. Oh, no! He's not wired for that! SPOT, power off. Power off! Oh, my God. What could've gone wrong? Get back! Ah, come on. Consider this a warning. Turn back now, or die. Sounds like good advice. - Can you repair him? - No, but if I can just-- Good old SPOT, he came through after all. Good luck. You, too. Ha"? 1 this isn't your fight. I'd understand if you stayed back. You think I came this far just to cop out in the ninth inning? Let's do it. - Hear that? - What is it? Damn! Can we jam the motor? It's on the other side. - We'll have to turn back. - Now what? - I don't know, run for it? Hey, he--. He couldn't have-- Come on, let's go. Wow, the old guy must have had some kind of fetish for ancient Rome. There must be more to it than antique hunting. All these papers, they're in Latin. It's a declaration. "I, Abbott Reeves, do hereby"... something, “ vex imperi senatus. Control of the Imperial Senate, ruler of the Empire, de vex terrarum, god-king on Earth." Hey, get a load of this. This nut thinks he's Julius Caesar. And he may be if we don't stop him. What? Reeves has perfected time travel. I think he intends to go back and rule ancient Rome. But if he changes the past... John must be at the front gate by now. Let's find that lab. Figures. John: Reeves! I've come back! Oven the gate! Reeves: Hold your fire! See what the creature wants. I demand your surrender! It's all over, Reeves! By now, my companions have raided your lab... your computer tapes, your data, they're gone! Reeves: You worthless machine. You suppose I'm so easily beaten? Show him the prisoners. Reeves: Now I demand your surrender. Throw down your weapons. John, no. Save yourself. Shut up! I'm so glad you've returned, Mandroid. You can serve as the first victim of my latest experiment. Prepare the iron disruptor. My pleasure, Mr. Reeves. Cover me. Its beam will turn your atoms inside out. Gunners, you may fire when ready. No! Adios, you walking junkyard. Get out, all of you! There you go, big 9"!!- Reeves! You're all alone! Come out and face me! Now, prepare to meet your maker. My God. I have twice your strength, Mandroid! I've got to help him. No, Reeves will cut you to shreds. John's our only hope. They've killed him. Let's get that son-of-a-bitch. You champion is defeated. And so now, are you. What's this? Now, farewell. Ancient Rome awaits its newfound Caesar. This thing is getting smaller. John. He's alive! Don't touch the web, it's charged. He knows. - Let go, you'll burn up! He's dead. - Reeves. - Hey, wait! - He got away? - No, he's still in transit. We have a chance, if I can just find the access code. That's it. Look, counter's slowing down! We're too late. He's landed. Damn! I knew I should have learned computer programming! I think you did it. I did? You've sent him back to 435 million B.C. Abbott Reeves is the ruler of nothing.
