[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [LAUGHING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC AND VOICES] [MUSIC AND VOICES] [MUSIC AND VOICES] Then he was looking at me in silence, for a very long time. - [GIRL] Didn't he say anything? - Dumb. He looked at me, dumb. [MARCO] Because he's crazy. [HIM] You're the one who didn't speak. No, actually, I spoke and I said to him: "What were you doing ... what were you thinking, there all alone?" and he replied: "I don't want to make you sad". [MARCO] For once he said something sensible. [HIM] Then she replied: "That seems unlikely". I don't want to make you sad. That seems unlikely. I was thinking about another party when I was a kid. I had brought a cake, my mother made it with so much love, to give to these very rich children. [HIM] I remember that I also got the wrong entrance. I remember these very long, very long corridors, full of ... ... of strange people. [VOICES OF CHILDREN] At first I didn't understand, [VOICES OF CHILDREN] They were playing football with my mother's panettone. Are you saddened? No. Maybe you're insensitive? Maybe. You, any bad memories? I ... No, nothing comes to me. [HIM] Worried about not having bad memories? [HER] I didn't want to appear superficial. It's a bit childish not to have bad memories, isn't it? No wait, wait, maybe I have one. [CICADAS CHIRPING] When my grandfather died. He wanted to die in the trees, and ... ... it was ... No, but that's not possible, it was probably under the tree. - I don't know why I remember it like that. - Because memories lie. - Yes. - Making things beautiful that weren't. Otherwise, life would be unbearable. In my opinion, no. In my opinion, it's not the memory that embellishes things. In my opinion, they were already beautiful before and maybe one ... ... realizes it after some time because one was not paying attention. [HIM] Everyone screaming ... a stain that was colored ... [CHILDREN IN CHORUS: Pissing underwater!] [HER] I always thought it was an urban legend that the pee gets colored. [HIM] What do you mean? Sure, like you said, there were pools like that. You can see why they banned them. For privacy. [LAUGHS] [HIM] Do you know that what you said struck me? I remember thinking: "Maybe I'm the one who sees ... ... these colored pees where there are none, and the world is not as bad as I think." [HIM] You are the angel who makes pee uncolored. [MARCO] Even if it doesn't seem like it, that's very romantic. [MUSIC] [HER] We don't even know each other's names. [MUSIC] [WHISPERS] [WHISPERS] Do you know what I like about you? That you're happy, but you're not stupid. Sounds good to me. [HIM] Everything sounds good to you. Everything is good, right? [HIM] You know, maybe I don't have good memories because ... ... something good enough has never happened to me. Then ... ... let's try to fix it. [MUSIC] [SEAGULLS CALLING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] [WINDOW SLAMMING] It will never be this good again, you know? No, I don't. Let's end it here, before the poem becomes mush. Over time, everything becomes "whatever". This way everything will remain a marvel. [HER] Here it is, maybe this is my first bad memory. [MARCO] Of course you were really crazy. [GIRL] You don't say those things. [MARCO] I said he was. In fact now he doesn't always talk about death, about hanging himself ... [HIM] Enough. [HER FATHER] Usually, this girl is always cheerful. I don't know what she has. What do you have? [HER] Nothing, sorry, I was thinking about an exam. Anyway enough with this story that I'm always cheerful. [MAN] It's difficult, Physics ... Physics no, it's wonderful. There's ... there's a ... [MARCO] The first time you told me, it was a single flower. The rest of the bouquet has grown over time. Madam! [MARCO] And the poetry, and the mush ... - [HIM] And then you die, I thought. - [MARCO] Of course. [LAUGHING] [CICADAS CHIRPING] - [HER] It's him. - [HER FATHER] Someone we don't know? Yes. - [HER] He appeared at this window here. - [MARCO] Did you get in the window? [HIM] No, I did not get in the window. [MUSIC] That's enough! But it's the truth, sorry we weren't playing chess, it always starts like that, right? [HIM] Tell them the theory of when we were children. [CHILD HER] And now? [CHILD HIM] Now when? [CHILD HER] Now, when I say this. [CHILD HIM] Ah, it was in the past when you said it. The present doesn't exist. [CHILD HER] Yes, now. [CHILD HIM] Listen, it was before, not now. [CHILD HIM] I'm sorry, the present doesn't exist, it's an illusion. [CHILD HER] But that's terrible. [HER] Maybe this is you, right? You told me you took a vacation around here. Doesn't this place remind you of anything? [HIM] That would be nice, but it would be too much of a coincidence. [HER] Anyway, in my opinion it's wrong, it sounds right but it's wrong, maybe you can have doubts about the rest, about the past, about the future, because where are they, do you see them? [HER] But the present ... perhaps only that exists. [HIM] The Visigoths of Fritigern, allied with the Alans, at least from what Albano Marcellino reports, they found themselves clashing with the imperial army of the valiant Valente. [MUSIC] [HER] The first time was in school. - Then there was the physicist. - Yes. [HIM] And then there was the one this summer. No, but that was ... so. He was just handsome. - Just handsome? - Yes. He was a bit ... a bit silly. - [HER] And what about you? - [HIM] Me? [HIM] Me ... not much. [HIM] The first was in middle school. But in short, the first real one was a Greek student. Then there was one time, with another ... Well. It was while I was with the Greek student. Then an artist. She made ... ... necklaces with ... ... with sanitary pads. Things like that. [HIM] Then that's it. Ah, no, no, then there was ... God, what's her name? [HER] What do I know? I dunno. Forget it. - [HER] Are you done? Done done? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes yes. [HER] Which was most important? None were important. Guys, let's get ready, the fog stopped rising. I'll take you to a place ... "I'll take you" did he say? [MARCO] We can also go dancing tonight, if we hurry. No, I don't want to dance. You two are a lovely couple. Oh really? Do you think that this one, in two months, has told me anything? I don't even know if he has grandparents. - [GIRL] Do you have grandparents? - [MARCO] I have a grandmother, you know her, right? [HIM] His grandmother is very nice, he doesn't take after her at all. - You never told me that. - Of course I did. - No, you didn't, impossible. [HER] I'm going to tell my parents we're leaving. [HER MOTHER] Bye. Excuse me if I interrupted, I was just a little intimidated, your sculptures are truly ... It's useless, I've asked him for years and he never made me model. It's because you are ugly. [LAUGHS] It's not true! [HER FATHER] Remove your clothes. Even the shirt? [HER] Dad, come on ... [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. [HIM] With Marco, in boarding school, - we did a kind of theater workshop. - Like? [HIM] Like ... they lined us up and we had to imitate what the first one did, things like that. [MARCO] I also have an aunt, three cousins ​​... - [GIRL] Go away! - [MARCO] Come on, sorry ... [HIM] But where is she going? [HIM] You would say goodbye like that? Now you use your imagination. [LAUGHS] Why do you always have to be an asshole? [MARCO] Did he tell you what we used to come here with those from boarding school? [She] A little, yes. [MARCO] This nostalgia thing ... I never got it. [HER] Me neither, but I'm learning it a bit. - [MARCO] You're an astrophysicist, aren't you? - [HER] Not really, not yet. - [HER] What about you? - [MARCO] I studied to be a journalist, but actually I'm a tour guide. [MARCO] And did he tell you the school dog story? - [HER] No, I missed that. - [MARCO] Ah, that's why you're still together! - [MARCO] Guys, what do we do, let's go? - [HER] Whatever you want. - [MARCO] Maybe I'll try to come back. - [HER] Come on. - [MARCO] Let him tell you the story of the dog though! - [HER] If he wants to tell me ... Will you tell me or not? [HIM] Wait a minute, I'll go check something. I'll be right back. [MUSIC] - But is that the same day your father made the joke? - Yes. - There was the fog? - Yes, then you disappeared, and Marco was there ... [TALKING AND LAUGHING] [HER] We went to the spa, the water was very hot. Are we here? Almost. Do you know that the custodian no longer remembers my parents? So it appears that another family lived here ... But don't we look like we'll waste their time? - [HER] No. - [HIM] Maybe a little bit, yes. [HIM] But when you speak, you have to make them believe that we want to take it, ask those questions about the apartment, about heating. Look look! Here there was always someone with puppets. - [HER] Here in the middle? - [HIM] No, maybe not quite here. - [HIM] That wasn't there. - [HER] No? [HIM] No. [HIM] Look how small it is, it shrunk. [HIM] Then all this light wasn't here. [DOOR KEEPER] I'm going to smoke a cigarette. [SHARP THUD] [HIS MOTHER] This fucking loft. You're crazy. I froze the dog here. What? He was dead, I didn't want him to rot. I felt sorry, I loved him. [HIM] Maybe that's why they sent me to a boarding school, among those madmen. [MARCO] Marco. [HER] How nice you are. - [HIM] Doesn't that scare you? - [HER] No. - [HIM] Your friend says it's a horrible story. - [HER] Who? [HIM] Marco. - My friend? - Eh. No, anyway it doesn't scare me at all. In fact you know what? I admire you. To us when the dog died, we threw it in the garbage and we got another one the same day. But fresh, not frozen. Anyway it's beautiful, I like it. Shall we take it? What do you mean, shall we take it? You mean ... to live here, you and me? I don't know, you want to be with someone else? No, but let's say it was a joke, that ... ... we were time wasters, no? [YELLING] If then the poem becomes mush, flesh. - We'll take it. - What? We'll take it. We'll take it. - We'll take it. - We'll take it. [DOOR KEEPER] Glory to God! Yes, we'll take it. You're sure, yes? [HIM] Oh my God. No! I crushed this mosquito! [MUSIC] [HIM] We stole a bear once at the village festival. - [HER] A bear? - [HIM] A stuffed bear, but it was gigantic. [HER] And how did you stay friends with Marco? Once he came up with something, he'd kiss me. Maybe because of that. [MAN] "When you get tired of being up there, you will change your mind." [CHILD] "I'll never change my mind!" [MAN] "You'll see as soon as you get down." [CHILD] "And I will never get down!" [CHILD HER] "And he kept his word ..." [HER] How many times have we lived before? [HIM] Me and you? But also ... ... in general. [HER] We're not even a thousand years old. [HER] It would take another life to remember it all. [HIM] Maybe soon we won't die anymore, and we'll have plenty of time to remember. But if you live forever, though, I don't know how much sense it makes to spend all your time remembering, and then other memories accumulate, the problem arises again, right? Well, but maybe they will invent a way to store them. - Store them? - Yes, so we don't miss anything. No, I don't know if I like that, memories are so beautiful. Yours, maybe. [HIM] And then when we no longer die, we will live in this city that is also a forest, which will have the best of both, and we will be a new civilization, happy, always. All this optimism? Your fault. [HER] I don't know. In the end, things are beautiful because you know they end. [HIM] No. Things are less beautiful because we worry that they will end. That's it. No, I don't know. No! Or maybe yes, maybe you're right. [SEAGULLS CALLING] [CICADAS CHIRPING] [CICADAS CHIRPING] [HER] I'm going now. I mean, I'm going away. [HER FATHER] We understood. [HER FATHER] What should we do? [HER FATHER] Call the marching band? [MUSIC] [HIM] Bizarre. [HIM] But when you came in, did you have it? [HER] I did repetitions. Food ... I got the mail ... I don't remember! [HER] Whatever, I'll survive. Does it feel strange to be in this house? A little strange yes. But good strange. [MUSIC] You? Are you happy? What's up? No, nothing. Something that made me a little sad. It's really stupid, I don't even want to tell you. Up to you. Moving on. - [BOY] Bye, professor. - [HIM] Great, take care. [VOCALIZING] Who was this, I don't remember? - [HER] What? No idea. - [HIM] It's very famous, I can't recall the title. [HER] Nothing, I don't know. [VOCALIZING] [HER] Come on, let me concentrate two minutes, please, someone else will come soon. I have to finish this. Is that idiot coming? [HER] He's not an idiot, he's bored. You said he's stupid. If he's bored with you, then he's stupid. [HER] Come on. [RADIO] [HER] Come on, please. [HIM] Nothing? He was a former priest, he spoke Latin. I swear this story doesn't mean anything to me. [PHRASES IN LATIN] [HER] Come on, are you upset? A little bit. To me it was one of our best memories. Sorry but, did you speak to me in Latin too? Yes but, this was the Tertullian expert, we started ... [HER] What? What's going on with you? I'm confused. It wasn't you, sorry. - Well, never mind, it's not serious, it happens. - No, it's serious, I'm sorry. - There are more serious things. - Yes, there are more serious things, but that was terrible. - That was monstrous. - Monstrous, even? [HIM] So Bogart and Bergman stay together? - No! - Yeah? - No! - Why not? No, she leaves with her husband. He stays with the Frenchman and tells him: "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship". [HIM] I mean, but do you think that in a Hollywood movie, she would leave with another man? Of course, that's her husband. You're too romantic. You're becoming me. He stays with the French commissioner. - With the man? - Yup. That's why he says, "No one is perfect". You're so stupid. But listen, in your opinion, is ours becoming a beautiful friendship too? Meaning? You know, a friendship. Beautiful, but a friendship. No, because ... No? Maybe in a way, yes. So yes? But in a way... ... beauty, particularly in love, it's normal for other things to take over. Then friendship is a good thing. A beautiful friendship, right? I say it's normal for things to change, which is a beautiful thing, that they change, right? - What's up? - I got a little cold. But where are you going? [HIM] Make friends with him. - [HER] Will you stop? - [HIM] Stop what? - [HER] Come on, please, will you stop? - [HIM] Stop what? - [HER] Being down. - [HIM] I'm not doing anything. - [HER] Exactly, you're down. - [HIM] You think? [HIM] Is there still room? Let's hug, come on. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [HER] Hello? You'll see that it's not something serious, cheer up. [FIREWORKS] [CRYING] [CRYING] [CRYING] Let's go. I can't stay here. [HER] She'll understand, my mother. Come on, we just got here. [HER] I know, but I can't do it. I'll light the fireplace, we can eat. Come on then. Okay, if you want to stay here alone. Stay, there's this good smell of death that you like so much. Okay? Okay. [MUSIC] I'll tell you a little more, alright? Because I can't, with him. I must always be cheerful. Is that you? Look how cute you are! No, these tapes aren't mine. - Sure. - No, they belong to the tenant who was here before. I'm going to finish the translation. Come on no, come on, let's watch a bit, okay? Come here. Who knows what effect it has on someone to see oneself again. Should we call the landlady later? Maybe she still has the number. Huh? Maybe they're dead. And why should they be dead, sorry? You know how it is, people die. Yes, I know very well. Sorry. [MARCO] But didn't you like that? Handsome and tortured? Maybe I changed. Well, I'll take advantage of this pause to take these things off. Yes, sorry. I came here without warning, without ... [MARCO] Don't mention it! [MARCO] You want some wine? Yes thanks. [MARCO] There's only red. [HER] Alright. But this house! [MARCO] It was my grandmother's. [MARCO] At first I wanted to redo it, but then I gave up. I started to like it like this. - [MARCO] Here you go. - [HER] Thank you. [MARCO] I'll tell you a story now, as a distraction. [HIM] Marco, these poems are shit, I'm sorry. [HER] You see? It just seems like everything can actually be bad. Would you like to read me one? "This morning I dried a cat with a hairdryer", is the title. [HER] I already like it. This morning I dried a cat with a hairdryer. I'd seen him before, I'd never let him in, too dirty and sick, and besides, I was busy. A bad cat, a street beast, a life of rain and cold in the fur. But this morning, wet and miserable, it moved my heart, wet and miserable for you. So I sheltered him, while it was raining outside, and since he sneezed, I made him warm. It's rather good. - He was jealous, I tell you. - I was a little ... [HER] No, it's good. I didn't imagine you writing poetry. - [HER] Do you have others? - [MARCO] Yes, but ... - This one? - Not this one ... - Why? - It's the worst. I'm gonna go. Thanks for the wine, and sorry again for arriving like this. It's just that I was in the area. I'm going, bye. [GROANS] [HIM] What was I doing to you? [HIM] You were already naked. [HER] No, you undressed me. [HIM] And then? [HER] Then, and then... [HIM] And then? [HER] And then that's it, come on, enough, I don't like this game anymore. - [HIM] Why not? - [HER] No. [HIM] How do you not like it anymore? We always have. [HER] Exactly, now it makes me a little sad, it doesn't turn me on anymore. - [HER] What is it? - [HIM] Sad? [HIM] It's not sad, it's romantic. Yes but ... ... maybe we can change the game. [HIM] Why? Why ... ... because the past is the past, right? Let's leave it alone for a while, it might run out. [HIM] I'm not in the mood anymore, sorry. [HER] If you want, I'll help you. What are you doing? [HER] I'll do it for you. [HIM] No. All right. Let's talk a little then? [HIM] Talk about what? Us. Come on, otherwise things will burrow inside. What things? [HER] Things ... Things, what things? [HER] Yesterday I went to Marco's, - and ... - Did you fuck him? No, I talked to him. But you wanted to, a little? - No. - A little, yes. Come on. Do you know what, maybe a little bit, yeah? Yes, maybe if I think about it, I wanted it a little. We should break up. - Are you stupid? - Do you see how things are going? - No, I don't see it. - Yes, you see it. [HIM] You see? - [HIM] Where are you going? - [HER] Where am I going? I'm going to my parents'. Fuck you, to my mother's. I'll take you. [HER] No need. [HER] No need, really. [HIM] Wait for me, I'll take you. [HIM] Wait for me, I'll take you! [CICADAS CHIRPING] [HER] Let's go, come on. [HIM] It's not our fault. [HIM] It started ending when it began. [VOICE OVERLAPPING] [HIM] But good strange. [HIM] Are you happy? [HIM] I'll light the fireplace, we can eat. [HIM] Do you know that later on, we wouldn't have the intimacy we do now? [HIM] Hey, this is my answering machine. [HER] What's in here? [MARCO] Uh, I don't know. [DANCE MUSIC] - [HER] No come on, I don't want to. - [MARCO] Come here. - [HER] Sorry. - [MARCO] No, don't ... [DANCE MUSIC] It was good. Yeah. [STUDENT] Oh, do you often bring girls here? - I know how it is ... - Where are you going? - Where am I going, to study for your exam. - Come on, stay a little longer. Alright. [STUDENT] The Assyrian empire instead falls in 604 BC and follows Nebuchadnezzar II, who is then opposed by a Phoenician-Egyptian coalition, anyway, then it clashes in the battle of Karkemish, in precisely 604 BC. Listen, do you mind if someone else takes the exam? It doesn't feel right, really. - It doesn't feel right? - No. - And you couldn't have thought of that before? - I thought about it now, sorry. [HIM] I was getting miserable, and so this morning I came looking for you, you are ... ... the least miserable thing I remember. Now kids too? I have a dirty, drug addict daughter. Fuck. [YOUNG HIM] What if I come to see you? Wherever you want, at the lake, at the sea. [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] [HIM] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Do I know you? Ah, you're the fruit seller's son, right? [RED] God, sorry, what are you doing here? Sorry, there's a huge mess in here. Don't worry. Come in, come in, so ... ... the house is all here. - [HIM] Can I? - [RED] Go, go. There's a baby. I have two of them. You? No. Now I remember you well. I think I also have a poem of yours somewhere. There was a cat, right? Yup. Thank you. You're welcome. What did you come here for? What were you looking for? I was looking for ... ... a little bit of poetry. [RED] With me? It's just that I was getting miserable, and so I came looking for you, you're the least miserable thing in my life. I also came a few ... a few years ago. [HIM] There was a lot of fog. But it was a different time, it was a ... ... a good time. Do you want to tell me the story? You want to hear it? I wouldn't have asked you, otherwise. I met this girl and in the beginning it was all a marvel, I didn't think I could live such a thing. [RED] And then? And then ... ... and then ... a lot of little cracks. And when those things happen it means that ... ... it's no longer like before, perfect. That's normal. Maybe it's just me who thought it was a big deal, like with you, - I thought ... - No, that's different. For example, I don't have all those good memories with you. Call her. Maybe bring her some flowers ... [MUSIC] [MARCO] What are you thinking about? [MARCO] What's on your mind? [MUSIC] [MARCO] So? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking ... [HIM] What are you thinking about? [HER] Nothing. I'm thinking of how much fun I've been having since I've been with you. [MUSIC] [MARCO] Something's vibrating. [MARCO] Keep going. [HER] Hold on. [HER] Five minutes, five minutes and I'll be back. Excuse me. [MUSIC] [HIM] To '. Listen, I understand it seems to you that everything was beautiful, but it's because you don't want to think you've wasted all that time. So you were right to leave, - you don't have to tell yourself that everything was perfect. - No. No, no, sorry, wasn't it you who said that something is already beautiful while it happens, - not just later, when you remember it? - Yes, yes, yes, I said that, but I was wrong. I know, sometimes it seems like that to me too ... - but no, it's just nostalgia, really. - No, it's my fault, I was down. I got sad, yes, it's true! But now, for these past months, look, look, look at this! Look! Right? Look! Hey. I love you, but ... ... I'm not in love with you anymore. I don't love you anymore. [DRUMS] [HER] Listen, we were never really good together. It doesn't seem like it to you now, but it's always wrong to go back. [HIM] I barely recognize you anymore. [HER] It's normal, time passes. I'm sorry, but you're a little pathetic, can you please pick yourself up? You're a little pathetic, please stand up. [HIM] Once you said I was deep. You weren't deep, you were sad, and you'll stay sad, and I don't want to ruin the rest of my life. It's called the passage of time. [HER] I love you. I'm not in love with you anymore. I don't love you anymore, I don't love you anymore, maybe I've never loved you. [DRUMS] - [HIM] Nothing? - [HER] Nothing. - [HIM] Bizarre. - [HER] Huh, yeah. When the dog died, we threw it in the garbage and we got another one the same day. [HIM] Enough! Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otone, Vitelli. Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, Commodus, Pertinax, Didio Giuliano, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Geta, Macrino, Diadumeniano ... [HER] Maybe it's like you said, it's poetry that has become mush, for me at least, it is. [MARCO] Hello, Marco. [HER] Then he took me for a ride to the beach. [HIM] Was it you who took the initiative? [HER] No, see, you weren't so limp back then. - [MARCO] And then you ...? - [HER] In short ... Marco. [HER] Marco. Marco. [SHOUTS AND APPLAUSE] - [BOY] Really? - [YOUNG MARCO] Yes! [BOYS] He's crazy! [YOUNG MARCO] He was burying a dog! [MOCKING LAUGHTER] Crazy! [DRUMS] It's strange. What? Everything. Oh yeah. [MARCO] So, What do we do with this nice rest of Sunday? Nothing. [MARCO] Nothing? Of course, lazy! [HER] Well you'll die anyway. [LAUGHS] [MARCO] I'll have a coffee. [MUSIC] [STORE KEEPER] Are you looking for something in particular? Perfume, but I don't remember the name. [STORE KEEPER] Is it for the girlfriend? [MUSIC] [STORE KEEPER] This is a little fresher. [MUSIC] That smells a little like coconut. [STORE KEEPER] I like this a lot, it's what I use. [MUSIC] [CRIES] [MUSIC] [TIMER] [TIMER] And stop. [STUDENT] No, prof, wait! - [HIM] Please. - [HER] Come. [HER] Usually it's more orderly, anyway ... ... anyway I'll tidy up. [MAN] Can I help you? What? - You need something? - No, no, no. I was ... do you live here? Yes, it's my home. I used to live there a few years ago. [MAN] Do you want to go up? [MAN] Do you remember the guy who came asking us to see the apartment some time ago? He also said he lived here, didn't he? [TALKING AND LAUGHING] Sorry, who came? A guy came and asked us to see the apartment, because he lived here twice: as a child and then as an adult. Do you remember when he came? [CINZIA] It would be a year, - at most two. - [MAN] Even less, Cinzia. [MUSIC] Yes, hello? Yes! Hello. [MUSIC] Hello. - [MARCO] I think they're waiting for you. - [HER] I didn't think I'd see you here. - [MARK] No shit. Come on, make this effort. However crazy you are. [HER] You look well. [HIM] Yeah? I am well. [HER] It shows, it shows. [HIM] I'm very well. [HIM] It's also a little thanks to you. I learned a few things. - [HER] Oh yeah? - [HIM] Yeah. [HER] For example? [HIM] To be well, to not have to look back, to not ask too much. [HER] Not ask too much? [HER] I don't think I ever said that. [HER] Anyway, I learned a few things too. [HIM] For example? [HER] For example, I became very good at being sad. [HER] Yes, it's something to do with you too. [HIM] But, if you hadn't called me, I wouldn't have ... ... ever thought to invite you. No look, I didn't even have your number anymore, I'd deleted it, I'd been good. Only then I remembered. Yeah ... [HIM] And why did you come? [HER] Because I was wrong, I thought ... look, I don't know what I was thinking. I was wrong, I was wrong. [MARCO] Bye! [HER] Oh yeah? That's awesome. Yup, what? Oh ... no, no, oh ... why not, of course. Listen, tell me what day it is, yes, if you tell me the day I'll mark it, let's see if I can ... ... be there, okay? No, no, you did well, and why not? No, look, I'm glad to, yes. I just have to figure out if there are ... yes, so maybe no more years pass before we see each other. [FIREWORKS] [FIREWORKS] [FIREWORKS] [FIREWORKS] [FIREWORKS] [HIM] How's your mother? [HER] Like usual. [HER] But what were you doing at the cemetery? - [HIM] Me? - [HER] Yeah. [HIM] I was just walking. [HER] What a question, of course. [FIREWORKS] [FIREWORKS] [HER] But isn't it a bit early for the fireworks? [HIM] They celebrate the year ending. Surely ... ... you could have chosen another place? Terribly nostalgic. Did you tell her? What? That you married her on the island where we met. No, I didn't. So ... ... how are you? - [HIM] Me? - [HER] Yes. Good enough ... she's gone, but good enough. Oh, but why? Because she wasn't stupid. [HER] I'm sorry. [HIM] It's not your fault. How are you? Me? I'm fine. Yes, I'm doing well. I rented a small house, cute, very bright and cheerful. I'm teaching. In short, I'm happy, I'm fine. It was nice to see you, to meet. Yes for me too. Bye. [MUSIC] [HER] You have to know how to make concessions. Without asking too much, knowing how to be satisfied, that's how it goes, right? [MUSIC] Are you at least a little happy? [HER] But what were you doing at the cemetery? [MUSIC] [HIM] I think snow is falling. - [HER] No. - [HIM] Yes. [HER] If you say so. [HER] And what of the forest city you talked about? [HER] Where people no longer died, and they would always be happy? [HER] Come on, those memories would be stored! [HIM] How did you come up with that? [HER] Nothing, I realized that we are in the future now, and ... ... and so I thought about it. [HE] Well, it had to arrive too, right? [HER] What? [HIM] The future, after all that present. [HIM] But the idea of storing memories was nice. [HIM] What a pity, all those memories that have been lost. What happened to them? [HER] I don't know, what happened to them? [HER] Poof. [HIM] Oh yes, Poof. [HIM] Poof.
