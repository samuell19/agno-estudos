The girl never asks the boy to go out with her. Never! It's a rule! Only the boy asks! That's such a stupid rule. -No! -Like, Raphael was the one who asked me. He's crazy about me. Raphael's a pervert. He stares at butts. Raphael stared at your butt? If he never stared at your butt, you're the only one! The other day, he said I was the most enthralling girl in school. "Enthralling"? He knows that word? -Yeah. -Maybe you think he's fascinating. Whatever! Oh, Raphael! Oh, kiss me! Shut up! -Go on, kiss him! -Shut up! -Stop it! -Kiss me! Stop! Myrtille, I think I got my... Do you have a...? Got your what? Stop it! Hey, Solange. Can I call my parents? Of course. Did you forget something? That's my little chicken! Stop! That's what I want -for dinner! -Stop! So why was I called in on a rescue mission? -Did you fight with Myrtille? -No. I had a problem... An urgent problem. Urgent, like it can't wait till we get home? No... I think I got my period. Sorry, I didn't catch that. My period! Don't make that face. In 40 years, you'll be cured. Can we go to the pharmacy? You're back already? Did you finish your project? -What's with her? Is something wrong? -Calm down. I'll explain. Are you leaving already? My flight's in two hours. You could have told me! -I told you ten times. -No, you didn't! As usual! What, another sick colleague? I can't watch her tonight! So what do we do? You're so irritating! You never call! I do! I'm not going to write letters! -So what do I do? Call Mrs. Vittoz? -Great, call her! Everything OK? If you want... to talk about it. If you want any advice. It's fine. I'm sorry about tonight. Your father was supposed to be here. I know, Mom. I'll pack my stuff. So you are staying over! Look what I made for dinner. Rabbit stew, your favorite. Oh, you look all shook up, poor thing. Go lie down. Hey, froggy! I thought it was Tuesdays and Thursdays. Something unexpected came up that my dad didn't expect. Don't be silly. You can come over whenever. Whenever you want. Leave my carrots alone! Let's go watch a movie. OK, Mom! This movie's great. Does it hurt bad? No, not bad. It only hurts if you're scared. Cut that out, you're too old. FOUR YEARS LATER Oh, Terry, we shouldn't. Come, help me! Coming! Soso, what are you doing? Eleven tonight, OK? Oh, no! 12:30! Last year was 12. I'm not coming home earlier this year. Who are you with? With Myrtille. He doesn't speak French, I don't speak English... Hey. -Hey. -So we look -at each other... -Hello. But he doesn't understand? Nothing. All I know how to say in English is "suck my dick." At some point... You need to learn how to say that for a girl. -You're not going to tell him that. -How come nobody says that for girls? What should I know? We can just ask him! No, we're not going to do that. "You have nice eyes. Make love to me!" I like your sequins. Thanks. Hey, sluts. Anybody got a cig? I quit a million years ago. You're hot, Solange. When are we going to sleep together? Once you can lick your elbow. Thanks, bye bye, see you later. Raph, how do you say "pussy" in English? We can't communicate with him. "Cunt." Don't hesitate to send me a pic of yours. For my collection. So you're the one who sends dick pics -to all the girls in school. -Busted. OK. -That's your tiny dick? -It's gross! -You haven't seen it. -Yeah, hang on... You're gross! Hang on, there's something in my shoe. Oh... OK. She's a pretty girl. And do you think I'm pretty? Did she kiss him? Did you see? -My friends are coming soon. -Yeah, no problem. A shot, please. WE'RE AT RAPH'S. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH TERRY? Excuse me, can we get a bottle of champagne? Thanks. Totally. What's your name? Charlotte. -Where are you from? -Cleves. Cleves? Be right back. You're not at the Easter celebration? No, it's lame. It's lame? So lame. See my friend over there? He's getting married tomorrow. That's why we're partying. We're firefighters in Thones. Do you dance? Hang on. Where are you going? -What the hell? -Let me go! Shit... Yeah? Are you ready? For...? We said we'd go fishing today. I can't. I'm seeing my friends later. Oh, OK. OK. Well, great. Have fun! Dry your hair before you go out. -Sorry. Another time. -No problem. Are you OK? You look like a zombie. It's Mom. Some days I just miss her more, that's all. It's stupid, but that's how it is. It'll be two years soon. Yeah... Are you still going to go fishing? No, no, I'm going to clean up a bit. Then I have to go to the Mathys' place. They've got a leak... Since I did the work on it... -OK. -Yeah. All right. -See you. -Yeah, see you. No, Myrtille, I swear. I'm not interested in Terry. I'll never hit on a guy you like. You should have come to the club last night, it was great. Yeah. A fireman. Seriously! He kept telling me how sexy I was... We kissed right away. He kissed so well... Then, you know what? He put my finger inside me! It just slid right in, I swear! No, you're crazy! He wanted to get together again, but I don't know. Dad! Can't you knock?! What? You don't like jam anymore? -Can't I have a little privacy? -Oh... Privacy? Nothing but. I lost my phone, Dad. What? It was brand new. Where did you lose it? It got stolen at the festival. Can you buy me a new one? You need to be more careful. You know how much it costs? Please! Can we go tomorrow? No, I can't tomorrow. I have to go away for longer than usual. I just came to get my stuff. You're leaving? Yeah. When are we going away? Where? On vacation! You said Greece. Greece, right. Greece. The thing is that it's not the right season for Greece. So Mom and I figured we'd do something different this year. We'll each go someplace different. Don't make that face. We'll go next year. It'll be great! We're going to Brazil. You'll love it. Stop. Stop! You know, if you have sex, you can get a disease? Serious ones, that can be fatal. Did you know? Uh, yeah... So listen. The only solution is to never have sex. Understand? Yeah. Never. Not with anyone. OK? OK. I'm not serious! Do you really think I can stop you? Only your mother would believe that. So listen. The real answer... is this. And any asshole who says it's useless, I'll kick his ass. OK? Make him put it on. You hear me? Make him. Do you know how it works? You don't need a PhD, but it's better to practice. With a banana. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. OK? Solange? I thought you were next door. I'm going. Guillaume's waiting. Did your father talk to you? He said we're not going on vacation. Yeah... That's one way to put it. So, what? You're getting divorced? I think it's time to face the facts. Are you staying over? See you tomorrow, then. Mom, I was thinking... The theater teacher is doing internships this summer. He said I could sign up. It's in Annecy. I could take the bus. We'll see. It sounds complicated. I need you at the store. You almost killed me! Where you going? To get my phone. Yeah, right. At a club? What the hell do you care? Get in. Jesus. Everyone gets to have fun but me. No one's having fun. You're a terrible babysitter. What would you do for a job if you worked? I do work. All the construction and stuff... And taking care of you! Seriously? Yeah. I hope you're well paid. Goodnight. Goodnight. PARTY AT THE CHATEAU! Seriously? Myrtille's invited, Ester's invited... Everybody but me. Isn't Myrtille your best friend? Sort of. What do you mean, sort of? You must be invited. No! Laetitia knows who I am, though. We knew each other in elementary school. Go through Delphine. You know Delphine. She's in your class, right? She lives at the chateau, too. I don't talk to her anymore. Oh? Why? I know her mother. She's almost a cousin. I can call her. No, oh my God. What, oh my God? -What are you doing? -What do you think? I'm calling Delphine. -Are you serious? -Yeah. No, please, stop! Let me do it! Let me do it! -No, please! -Let me! -Please! -Let me! Please! -Wait! -No! -It's ringing! -Hang up! -Why are you doing this? -Delphine? Yeah? It's Guillaume Vittoz. Laetitia de Chanez is throwing a party on Saturday? I would rather a thousand times die by the poniard that have my name made the vile jest, the quibble, and sarcasm of the rabble! I demand justice! He said he would leave me the house. No, I just know that there's no point asking now. I don't know. I... I don't know. With her, I guess. I'm not going to ask him for a-- No, but you said "alimony," and... I hope not! I had to fight for a weekend, and now... No, I mean... I hope, for summer break, yes. He didn't ask me anything. He doesn't care! Good for you, but I know him. Soso! Is that my skirt? No, not that one. You'll mess it up. I'm listening, Valerie. I was talking to Solange. Good for you. What do you want me to say? Good for you and your husband. No, I see why you're late. Just five minutes. Let's say it was worth it. You look good. Thanks. So, are the de Chanezs really nobles? Like, de Chanez, like de la Mole? You got that right. Your skirt's falling down. Thanks. And yet I'm so fat. I'm going to replace one meal with a cigarette. All these years, you made us think you lived at the chateau, like you were a princess. Well, I do live at the chateau. Well, out front, anyway. Yeah, well, you're still a liar. I never said otherwise. If people thought so, that's their problem. Since kindergarten? Jesus, Solange, we were kids! It's like when whatshername said a parachutist landed on her roof, or... or like your dad. What about him? Like he's a pilot. Everyone knows he's an airline hostess. A steward. He's a man. OK, a steward. Well, here you go. Anything you want to drink... I'm having a gin. -Have fun. -Where are you going? I'm just a domestic. You're here, but you're not here. Laetitia's just being charitable. Same for you. Look at you. If you're fine with it, great. I'm going to smoke. I know you. You're one of Delphine's old friends. Did you two make up? We never really had a falling out. It's nice of you to come. Did you bring something to drink? I'm teasing. I like your style. It's unique. Thanks. You too. What did Delphine say about me? That I was a huge bitch? Uh, no. She said she was going to go smoke. Like, smoke? You're cute. I love this song! Here we go! I feel like I've seen you before. What's your name? Solange. And you? Arnaud. Are you an actress or something? Yeah, a little. I was in "Lucretia Borgia" in middle school. It was at the town center. Oh, shit, right! That was you. You were good. Really. Thanks. I like being in this kind of altered state of mind. When your mind is super sharp or... totally sleepy. I don't know which I like more. Feeling sharp is great, because... Because you feel everything so much more intensely. Yeah, same, I love it. But it wears you out. When you're sleepy, kind of dozy, that's cool, too. You feel things differently. Then I get a broader view on political issues, for example. You get like a bird's eye view. Totally detached. Like aliens. Yeah, like aliens. And you feel less alone too. Way less. Yeah. I feel alone too. At your age, that's normal. You don't know how to define yourself other than compared to others. You know, at first, people have no conscience? No defined character? So... when I'm alone, torturing myself to figure out who I am, I'm actually nothing? You only exist in relation to others. Sartre said that. But then, when you're alone, you'd be... Shadows. Like empty containers. But I'm sure I keep existing, even when no one's there. Even more so, in fact. It's not that. You can't escape the fact that others make you what you are. Even your parents. What do your parents do? They died. In a plane crash. Oh, shit. Well... just my father. My mother runs a store. So you've gone through something terrible. And a lot of people must see you as this girl who had this thing happen to her. So you have to fight to break out of that image. And that's normal. But still, you can't forget what you've learned. Or, not what you've learned, exactly. You can't forget the fact that you have learned. You can't de-evolve. I don't want to be on the floor. Come on. You've never done this to a guy? Don't worry. I've never done this to a guy, either. Yeah! Come on, don't look so grossed out. It makes me feel bad. It's not that. You know, guys feel a lot better when the girl swallows. It's nicer. But for your first time, that was promising. Very promising. I'm not going to rape you... You're not very liberated. Stop! Do... do you want my number? Yeah, sure. 04, 50... 04? What is that, the 20th century? I lost my cell phone. Do you have a pen? Go ahead. 04, 50, 60, 11, 73. And you? It's give and take. You give me a landline, I'll do the same. Old school. Don't you want to go out? Look how nice it is outside! Don't sit there all day. Come on! Up and at 'em! You're acting like my mom. Leave me alone! -Look at you! -Fuck off! Oh, boy... No sense of humor. Maybe you're just not funny. Hello? Hey, Ozzy. How's your hand? Huh? I'm just doing some yard work. Mulch for the tomatoes. It's important, since it's so hot. "It's important"... You have to. Otherwise they'll all die. Next week? I've got work. I'm doing the Toriels' bathroom. Mary, mother of God, please, make Arnaud call me, please. I'm begging you. Make him call me. Sorry, that took a while. How are you, Solange? Do you want to have dinner here? I'd like to talk to Guillaume. OK? -OK. -OK? Don't look so excited. That guy, Marilyn Manson, he was doing black masses, right? Yeah, well... He's not a good example, because Manson isn't hard rock. -No? -No. But whatever. Mostly he's just a spectacle. There's nothing religious about it. Even with Black Sabbath, if you go down that road... It's more ironic, -it's kind of... -I don't know. For me, something's off. I wouldn't see that as a spectacle, it's... I don't know... Soso, will you clear the table? It's OK, I can do it. That was wonderful. Oh, Guillaume, it was frozen pizza. But the salad was great. Thank you. Do you help him out? All the time. Have you heard from Dad? Heard what? He went off with his new woman. So no, I didn't get a postcard. So now we don't talk about him? It's like he doesn't exist? Don't start, please. Where are you going? I'm not hungry. I'm going to bed. Solange, you can sleep here! Arnaud? Solange? I didn't call you sooner, because... What is it? Solange... I keep thinking about your mouth and your breasts. You're very promising... I love you. Hello? No! Call back! Please! Call back! Yes! Hello? Yeah, it's Arnaud. Did you try to call me? Uh... no! Well, your number was in the missed calls. Really? That's so weird! Why not? OK, see you tomorrow! -Yeah. -See you! Yes! I'm starving. You're kind of freaking me out. You should know something. You're in love with your father. What? I don't give a shit about my father. You say that because you haven't thought it through. Things are connected. Stuff happened a long time ago, like in your grandparents lives, that have an influence on you. It's the same with your father. You have to free yourself mentally! Otherwise, you know what'll happen? You'll throw yourself at the first guy who comes along! Because you're in love with him. He's the tyrant of your inner world. It's like your father's inside you, operating you by remote control. Making you do stuff you're not even aware of. Why should I listen to you about love? You're a virgin! You've never had sex. You're impossible to talk to. I'm here all the time, and I've never seen you with a girl. No, not at all the time. I'd know. It's obvious when a guy's a virgin. How's that? It's just obvious! Watch out! Or maybe you're not into girls! You're gay, right? Gay! Shit... You forgot something. We're not going far. You're not going anywhere without a helmet. Are you serious? Do you have to sit right there? I'm good here! We're having a nice conversation. Very funny. You're going to be hot in that black skirt. Asshole. -He's coming! -Shut up! Who's that? Your brother? Yeah, yeah. Let's go. My condolences! Here we are. It's small, but I don't care. I could live in a barrel. What matters is the space you have in your mind. Depends on the mind. Yeah, right. Yeah? Aren't you going to introduce me? We haven't met, have we? This is Solange. Say hello, Solange. Hi, ma'am. I don't think I brought enough cookies! No, this is great. OK, then. Thanks. So, that was my mom. Does anyone call you Angie? No. So I'm the first? You're not very talkative, Angie. I try not to talk unless I really have something to say. Don't you think we talk about pointless stuff, to people who aren't listening? Yeah, totally. But I listen. I listen carefully. So I have to do it all? Let me show you something. Look. OK. See the Venus person? He represents the domination of empire. The naked guys are the laboring masses. And the creature with helmets are like free electrons. Domination of the empire, sure... You don't like porn? You're wrong... Porn has everything! Philosophy, politics... life! I don't like it because the actresses are pretending. Real acting, you have to believe it. In her eyes, I can see she's bored. Hang on! I'll be right back. What? You have to have a first time if you want to have a second. It's not that. I can't right now. You mean, you've got your thing? Yeah. I don't mind. -We can still... -Yeah, no. Too bad. But you know, girls can still do lots of stuff. Want to take care of me? What are you doing? I said I couldn't. Right, since you can't. The ancient Greeks did this because girls wanted to stay virgins. Don't worry, I'll go slow. Wait! It hurts! Sorry, I'll go slow. OK? OK... Does it hurt? What did you say? Go slow! -Like this? -Yeah. Wait! Wait! Wait, I'm gonna come! You're sure in a rush to get dressed. It's because... you know... I have to go run errands with my mom. Should we drop you off? You know, I know your mom. She has that souvenir store on Chateaubriand street? Things must be tough for her too. Your father... like Arnaud's father. We're good for Tuesday! Fred's giving me the keys. So I can take the car? Tuesday, OK, when will you bring it back? When do you need it? Thursday. You're going away? That's what you do when you graduate high school, right? -Where are you going? -Grenoble. So I won't see you again? Sure we will, if I ever come back. Some weekend. I'll call you. You'll be around, right? Did you have a nice time? Yeah, it was great. What's going on? -Hi, Solange. -Hi. Hello. -I'm getting this. -You already picked something? Can you wrap it up? It's for her father. Of course. You're not with your pen pal? Terry, right? He went back to London. We're going to meet up soon. Did you hear? -About what? -Laetitia de Chanez. She's a lesbian! Yeah, right. Where did you hear that? She told Alexandre. When he tried to sleep with her. Sometimes you say stuff to get guys to back off. Fine, don't believe me. But she's sleeping with Delphine. Delphine. Yeah. Her servant. Can you imagine? And Delphine tried to kill herself, but she didn't take enough pills. Obviously, half a box isn't enough. Where did you hear that? My aunt Sophie works at the hospital. Thanks. You haven't slept over in a while. We should do something before Myrtille goes to England. Right, girls? Well, see you soon, I hope. Say hello to your mom for me. Yeah. -See you. -See you. They were out of primroses. What? Every year we buy him white primroses! She couldn't order any? They were out, Mom. Honestly, is that too much to ask? A little consideration... How did it go with the lawyer? You didn't tell me. What do you want to know? He told me what I already knew. And charged a lot. At least you went to Annecy and saw the lake. Summer is awful here. You get married, you work, and that's it. Your dreams dry up. You don't know why or when, but you realize you don't dream anymore. Your only horizon is a store full of tchotchkes that's sinking in debt, to boot. Take my word for it, Solange. Don't get married too fast. Think about yourself first. Oh, I saw this in the window of Cash Express. I thought of you. Oh, Mom! I even got your old number. It wasn't easy, but I managed. How much memory does it have? I have no idea. It's for calling, right? -Do you like it? -Yeah. It's not super-fast... Oh? Well, you're welcome. Listen, Soso, I need some time off. I'm going to your aunt's in Dignes for a few days. I'm counting on you for the store. Keep it open a little every day. It's busy in the summer. And start doing the inventory, OK? I'm not inviting you... You know how Valerie is. And you're good at Guillaume's. It's like vacation. Put your seatbelt on. When you're young like you, you like to be waited on, but the real pleasure is cooking for others. I followed her recipe. I hope it comes out the same. -It smells really good. -Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. There's something I've been wanting to say, but I don't know how you'll take it. You shaved your whole body? Can you be serious for two minutes? OK. This Arnaud guy. He's not right for you. Be careful with him. I know guys like him. All they want is... Are you jealous? Excuse me? You think I don't see you get hard? What's wrong with you? Arnaud is a real man. He made it out of here. He's not stuck in some shitty old house. OK... Forget it. You don't need to be worried. I'm still a virgin, if that's what you're wondering. You're impossible. Maybe you don't want to hear this, but that guy's a total jerk-off. What are you doing? Can't you see? I'm getting a beer. Make up your mind. If I'm old enough for someone to want to sleep with me, I'm old enough to have a beer, right? You're being ridiculous. No, I mean... Hey, what are you doing? Does it look like I don't know what I'm doing? Stop it. Sh. Let me. -No... Solange! No! -Sh... See? You're hard. TO ESTERRE: WANNA HANG OUT? Come in. I don't bite. I have a thing tonight. Do you want me to go home? No, I wanted to... Do you want to come with me? Yeah. He's good, huh? -Hey, man! -It's been a while! Great to see you? -Solange, you remember Ozzy? -Yeah! Solange? Are you going to play? Oh, no, no. It's been too long. Why? You were good! He was the best! Sure, he's fattened up a little... Oh, yeah? Put some Marty Freedman on! -Come on! -No... Come on! -You'd like it? -Yeah! It's your comeback for Solange! DJ! URGENT: CASTING MINOR ROLE SEEKING GIRL 15-16 YEARS OLD Look who's back! I've never seen you here. Are you an actress? Not yet, but I want to be. Oh, man! Want to watch? -Yeah. -Let's go. Vittoz! Yeah! Vittoz! Yeah! Vittoz! Can I come? See, you want it. What's your problem? You're trying to drive me nuts? I want to watch with you. I don't get it. Your life is falling apart, and you... Your parents are splitting up. Don't you care? Your mother? Delphine? Did you go see her at the hospital? Not even a phone call? It's like it all slides off your back. You're cold! Nothing gets to you. You only think of yourself. Me, I'm cold? I'm doing everything I can to help my mom. I'm running her store, helping her run errands... You know where your mother is right now? She's at a clinic. No. She's at her sister's. No, her sister found the place for her. It's near her place. But why? Because she's depressed. Because she can't take it anymore! Why didn't she tell me? Aren't I her daughter? She told me. This is adult stuff. Adult stuff? I'm supposed to understand that? And I'm the kid in the story? You knew and didn't tell me! You're the one who's cold, who only thinks about himself! Solange! I'm sorry! OK? I'm sorry. OK? See? Nobody wants me. Even you reject me. -No! -I'm useless. I could die and it wouldn't matter! No! I'm sorry. Does it hurt? Don't stop! "I am convinced "that I will never see you again. "I cannot take this any longer. I have grown weary." "It is simple! It will have been four months soon. "It is not my fault. "My patience grew tired of waiting for your virtue to give way. "It is not my fault. "I cheated on you with Emilie, but she is not the only one. "There is another woman, whom I love to distraction, "and I fear that I must abandon you. "I took you with pleasure... I leave you without regret." That's it! Thanks for listening. Hello! My name is Solange Granier. -I'm 15. I saw... -Solange! -...your ad. -What are you doing? I've been doing theater -for two years-- -Coming! He belly-flopped! That must have hurt! Plus you almost went in first! Did you hear the water? Yeah. Go! -Ready to go? -Yeah! Want to dive again? Move over... Come on! He looked at you, like "wow"! You just missed a love story. Maybe! OK. I'm going to get a drink. -Do you want anything? -Ice cream! -Ice cream, please. -Ice cream? Strawberry-melon! -Peach-Nutella! -Lime, for me. -Lime... -Thank you! You're the best! Thank you! OK, girls! Yes! "Kamasutra, find your favorite position." Oh, my God! Are these sex positions or the Olympics? The gold medal goes to... Nathalie Demont! I pick... Rocking chair looks nice! -Yeah! -It looks great. It's the best! Level three! Are they serious? This is so weird! "Athletic, but not too much!" Some people must need the inspiration, because besides the "BJ-oral-penetration" combo... Yeah... Guys watch too much porn, and it ruins their karma. Or when they stick their tongue in your ear, they think it's hot. It's gross! The worst, though, is when guys put their finger in your ass. There's nothing worse than that. Yeah, yeah. I don't get why "cunnilingus" is such a difficult word when "blow job" is simple. Yeah, but anyway, I don't like getting oral. I think it scares guys. -Yeah? -Yeah. I disagree. If they have feelings for you, it's all good. Everything is more intense. Sure, it's way better. Because you've done it? Yeah! -Oh? -Yeah! Big news, Esther, I didn't know. That's how it goes. What? What about you, with your surfer. -Nothing to tell? -Come on! It's going well, but I'd rather not discuss it. It's personal. Is he why you're never around? You never answer your phone. Yeah, we never see you. -It's not that. -No? I don't know... I don't know how you do it. I couldn't stay with one guy like that... -I need some air. -Yeah, but... We really love each other, so... We want to be together. That's so cute! I think we've got company. -They have no idea... -Yeah. They're like, 12. I don't sleep with kids! Hey, sorry to bother you, my friend was wondering... Are you lost? Are you looking for your mom? Depends. Want to adopt me? Can I help you? Vanilla-strawberry for everyone. -Thanks. -No, it's... What did you want? I didn't want anything. You wanted to, you know... Go ahead, explain. No need to get upset. I'm not upset. Just explain why you're disrespecting my nieces. We were just getting to know them. Oh? Well, great, that's done. I think you should run along now. It's all good! Come on. Let's get out of here. Later we could go the bars in Annecy! That'd be so dope! -Yeah, that'd be awesome! -Yeah, right. -Please! Why not? -We're not far! -Not too late... -No. One little drink... -Not even with alcohol. -Yeah! -Yeah, no alcohol. -Come on! No! Should we get the mail? Now you look like a conquering hero! No! -What? -No, not the wig! -It's the best! -Oh, no... Let me see. You look good as a woman. Oh, yeah? I seriously doubt that. You're wrong. It's... What? Confusing. I'm the cave woman, taking you to my... There, are you sure? Yeah! It doesn't hurt? Arnaud... Yeah, up there. Hi, Solange. How are you? -Hello. -Hello. Myrtille said Solange has been spending a lot of time at your place. Yeah, her mother is a little overwhelmed. That's kind of you. But the girls never see each other. Solange could spend a few days with me, right? Myrtille is just getting back from England. Sure, why not? I mean, ask her. What do you say? It's just that, I'm near the house, when Mom's here. It's convenient. She'll be here all weekend... Thanks for the invitation, though. -Bye. -Bye. Solange? Solange? Is everything OK? Yeah, why? Do you have someone to talk to? If you ever need help? I don't need help. You know you could talk to me. About what? You're becoming a woman. You might need advice. Even just about protecting yourself. No? -I have to go. -Hang on. Let me give you a number. This is my OBGYN. You can call her, or go anonymously. She won't call your parents. Here. Solange? Thanks. What did she want? You didn't say Mom was coming back this weekend. What if we left Cleves? The two of us? I'd fix the van up. We could sleep in it. -In the van? -Yeah. No one would know us or look at us weird. I'd love to live on the road. Do odd jobs just when we need to. Imagine it. I don't know. Or we could move to Annecy. I'll sell the house and buy something by the lake. You could go swimming whenever. And I'd do work there. All those folks with yards, they need someone to work on them. I like doing yard work. And it pays pretty well. What do you think? What do we do? I don't know. What do you want to do? I did some research. If it's early, you can just go to the hospital and take a pill. I just don't want to do it in Annecy. Myrtille's aunt works there. I don't want anyone to know. We'll go to Grenoble. It's a big city. I'll find a place. OK? Do you still want me? Of course. Why wouldn't I? I don't know. The first dose will be taken with me, at your next appointment. I'll give you mifepristone It blocks progesterone and induces contractions. It's not very painful, but you might bleed. But that doesn't mean that the egg has been evacuated. You'll have to take another medication, misoprostol, 48 hours later. Then you'll have more contractions, which will terminate the pregnancy. The pain will be like your period, but much stronger. I'll prescribe you painkillers. Then I'll see you two weeks later for one last appointment to make sure the pregnancy has been terminated and there are no complications. Do you have any questions? No. Since you're a minor, you'll have to meet with a social worker, a therapist. And you can still change your mind. Do you use protection, Solange? Do you think I should be on the pill? It might be more reasonable. I need an appointment for later this week. Yeah. Let's see. Can I ask you for a favor? Of course. Come in. I'm looking for Arnaud. Is he here? He must be with Jennifer. I think they went out. Do you know where? No. Camille, do you know where Jen is? With Arnaud. Yeah, that's all we know. -OK. -Stay, though. I'm just as interesting as he is. No, thanks. See you. Hang on. Try the Buvette du Marché, in the pedestrian area. They always end up there. Thanks. Hey. Next one's on me. Can we get two beers? -How's it going? -Fine, you? I'm good. What's your name? Solange. Solange? Nice to meet you. I'm Anthony. Nice to meet you, Anthony. What do you do in life, Solange? I do theater. Theater? "To be or not to be," all that? -Sure. -Do you like it? Yeah. That's why I do it... How long have you done that? A few years. Two years. Two years? -And what have you-- -Karine? We're outside. Can you get us four beers and a glass of white wine? Have you done anything I'd know? Yeah? Uh, yeah. "Lucretia Borgia." -What? -Angie? What are you doing here? Just having a drink. Anthony was keeping me company, but I think we've said all there is to say. Oh, I get it. OK. You didn't have to let me buy you a drink if you already had a date. So you buy me a drink and I'm supposed to sleep with you? For three euros? Sleep with... Why are you laughing? I never said I wanted to... You know what? Have a good night. -See you. -Goodnight. You've changed. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Something's different. Come on, I'm with some friends. It's cool. -Come on. -OK. Cheers! It's me, right? No, it's me! -Yeah! -No, it's me! It's always the same with you! OK, OK. He's crazy. Angie isn't you real name, is it? Everyone's called me that since I was little. It's like your youth name. Yeah! Do you want to go be alone for a bit? Yeah, but what do I do about Jennifer? It's cool. I have a boyfriend too. Oh? Who? -A firefighter. -A firefighter? I think he's getting on my nerves. He's going to beat it. We won't see him ever again. I think he's going to take Jennifer with him. Hey man, can I have your car keys? We wanted to go to Nox! Walk there. It's not far. I need your car. -Oh, yeah? -Solange! -OK. -Thanks, bro. Solange? Solange, let's go. You're Solange's brother, right? Yeah, that's right. Come on, let's go. It's cool, I'll bring her back later. Let go of me. Come on, Solange! Don't touch her! Who are you? You don't know her. You don't know this girl, OK? Come on! Cool it! Don't touch her! Fuck! That's enough! Get out of here or I'll call the cops! Come on, let's go. -Leave! -It's cool. You're bleeding! Who is he? He's not your brother? He's my babysitter. Your what? You need a babysitter? Yeah. Well, he's not going to ruin our night. Didn't you want to see Grenoble? Let's go! It's not worth it. I like you, Angie, but... Seriously! Will you take me back? You want to leave me already? My mother's getting back soon. I have to be there. What the hell? What's going on? Stay back. Easy. I live here, next door! What happened to him? I can't tell you, miss. Is he going to die? We're doing all we can. Stephane, tell them we're on our way. You OK? If you have problems, you can talk to me. I can... I can help you. Nothing's wrong. Do you want me to stay? Kiss me. When are you coming back to Grenoble? Soon. I'll call you. I've been trying to call you for an hour. Who's that boy? Your boyfriend? Yeah. What happened to Guillaume? He drank weedkiller. A lot. I drove all night. I got here at dawn. The music was playing from his place, loud, and I thought you were partying. It's summer, I figured... that I'd come hug you. I came in, and... he was on the floor. I don't understand. I need to show you something, Solange. It's very important that you tell me the truth. This was on the ground beside him. "I'm leaving with Arnaud. "Forget me. Thanks for all the good times. "I'm sorry. XOXO, Solange. "PS: Don't try to stop me, or I'll tell everyone." What could you tell everyone? Nothing. Did he hurt you? Solange? I can't be upset with you for hiding things from me, and... I know you have every reason to think I'm not a good mother. Maybe you think I'm not strong enough. But if he hurt you, I swear I'll be there for you, honey. I swear. He tried to kiss me. Once. He wasn't violent. He'd just drank a bit too much. And that's it? That's it. I'm so sorry, Solange. I left you all alone. No. No, Mom... Don't worry. I'm OK, I promise. All right? BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MARIE DARRIEUSSECQ Adam Lozier Subtitling: Hiventy
