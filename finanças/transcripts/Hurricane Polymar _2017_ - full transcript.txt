By the way, where did the Polymar suit gone to? Hey, stop! It's stolen again, huh? Yeah, by an unknown man The man who wear that suit is a Karate martial artist That's why he only uses kicks This case hasn't been resolved yet I'm sorry... ...Because I couldn't get the stolen Polymar suit back... ... For now... Well, at least we defeated the man who wear that stolen suit Yes Sir How is it going? It's still under investigation, Sir You must get the Polymar System back immediately And never fall into the hands of criminals anymore Good luck Yes Sir Got it, Sir That was close. Luckily we didn't say anything wrong Commander is the man behind... ...Polymar suit development... ...as the Project Head ...That's why, Miss...

It's nice to work with you That's impossible Looks like from now on you need a partner It's nice to work with you "Partner" Why should I be his partner, Sir It's been decided that you will work with him However... There's a saying, "There's always a solution for any kind of problem" Could you tell me what that means, Sir? Just find out the meaning yourself Why should I be his partner anyway Good morning, partner It's still morning. Cheer up a little, Sharlock Please stop calling me Sharlock, okay Hey, do you know where those bad guys base is? No one knows, that man also didn't remember anything Really, huh? Who gave him that Polymar suit then? His suit is just a copy Copy? The red one is the original And no one knows about it This is so confusing Even Sharlock looks confused I'm not Sharlock Let's go then That man dropped it when we fight Pika Dale That place is a double district, which is near the city center So it would be easy to find that place Hey, Sharlock I'm the one who found that match, you know "Why did you just stand up" "Let's get out of here" "You're late, they've gone" That's why I'm coming with you guys Let's go! Go, go, go! I had to tell her about this I can't hide it from her - You lie! - I'm Sorry Why'd she has to come with us anyway? Go, go! It's dangerous Go, go, go, go! Go, go! I don't believe this Awesome Double district is really interesting place Stay alert, look around and search carefully Excuse me, what is to be aware of? Seems difficult to find that place here So that's the place.. Pika Dale But why is it closed? Alright then, you go inside and get some information Okay... ...Detective Chief Will this be okay? Leave everything to her to get some information? You shouldn't underestimate her She's good at strategy What's this? It's a gift for that pretty girl... But why? You want to ask her out, right? Then you have to give her some gift Anyway, I've given up. It would be better if she's with you About that... I think it's impossible Really, huh? In that case... No! Let me do it! It's only 20 Yen then 20 Yen? I bought it at an antique shop So it's not just a gift? Of course not Yes? Okay... Got it... Was that Teru? Come closer What's that all about? Are you out of your mind? Mr. Detektif, Sharlock Come here.. Hurry... - Did you get something? - Let's Go! That's too bad.. Gin has been arrested We can do nothing It's his own fault anyway It's nothing to do with us all We've ever lost the suit But why is she still giving it back to us? Doesn't she mind it at all? Who do they mean by "She"? It seems that there's another helmet, gloves and shoes What are you doing? Silent! We found their base Who's that? What the hell are you doing? Let me handle this My hand feels wanna punch someone... Oh, it's you again Go get them Detective Chief... This is bad... Mr. Yoroi... Take this Let's get out of here Hey, stop! What are you doing? No need to do that Hey, who gave you that helmet, gloves and shoes? Stop it Mr. Yoroi Just leave the rest to the police... You think someone's life is a toy, huh? That wound... That move... I think I've seen it before Fine then, I'll find out who you really are Hur... ...ri... ...cane! Mr. Yoroi Your move just now... ...I guess... ...You must be... Polymar Reversal... Damn it!!! What's wrong? About last night... You must've known it will happen, don't you? Nothing can change only by knowing it That's why I'm looking for you I want to quit Quit? I don't think I can do this Two guys lost their lives because of me About that... I don't think it's your fault Yes Sir... Understood... There's no problem here ... Thank you very much Director Tokita was in a meeting, so he sent us home early I see... Director must have persuaded him I'm sure he's gonna be just fine He must have felt guilty for not being able to save those guys live He might be want to quit But... ...No one can wear Polymar Suit but him Joichi... You must be tired so that you fell asleep, and now you shocked when I wake you up Let's go out and find something to eat then You don't have to feel guilty for that incident Feeling better? You're just too weak Be a tough man You're the only one who can get rid of your own anxiety Now, wait a minute... I think this is also your fault, old man Yeah, you're right You have so many chances compared to me Chances? A good partner? Me and him? Sounds great, right? Both of you look good after all... No, that's not gonna happen By the way... I have something to give you... ...Because we've been partners for a long time Will you... I mean, would you... ...Like to... ...Answer my question earlier .. For that one, let me think about it first. I... ...Will take it as a gift... ...From a good partner... I'm sorry for not being able to accept you... I... ...I will wait for you no matter how long... My plan seems successful, She took the gift Cheer up! Why are you still look so down? Come on Joichi, what wrong ? Aren't you also feel down about the incident? I don't want to remember about it anymore Let me tell you something... ...very important... I don't wanna talk about it.. Don't you want to know... ...The man who wear that green Polymar suit? Damn you! I've found him! Take a look at this Real name is Wong Yu Kun He's a Chinese-American I knew it... It's him... Bullet Wong... His fighting style relied on speed Why would he became a Polymar? I've been hit by him Arw you sure that this is his training ground? Not really... But he's a man who likes to take up challenges I met him once "Hey, wait" "What do you want?" "Wanna fight?" That's the first time we met He helped me with my training... ...Develop Hurricane moves He was my partner during the training Until I managed to develop that moves Hurricane, huh? It's not an easy move to defeat Furthermore... ...He succeeded in developing his own moves... "Powerfull, isn't it?" You mean that Polymar moves? That move... There's only one man in the world who uses that move Such a quick and powerfull movements Watch out! Everyone, get out of here... Hurry up! Mr. Yoroi, quickly transform into Polymar That movement is the typical style of Bullet Wong It's me, Takeshi... It's useless Mr. Yoroi How can we know if we don't try it first Polymar Transformation To defeat the darkness... ...The Light of Justice is My Power! Mr. Yoroi... I will stop you no matter what... And for that, I must defeat you Triple... ...Dragon Kick! Hur... ...ri... What? ...cane! There's no way you can master my move Hey, Wong... what's wrong? Wong... Polymar Reversal... Hey, Wong.. hang on! Wong! What is happening? Hang on.. Takeshi... Wong... Wong... Wong... Wong... Excuse me Ah, Sharlock... Bullet Wong's death cause has been found out... Amphetamine Drugs is the cause It destroys... ...his internal organ... ...Causes heart attack So drug it's the cause? Stupid guy... Use such thing like drugs... If he didn't use it, maybe I'll lost However... ...He's a great man He managed to master your move.. You're right... ...And perfect also... Even I feel lost, but... I'm glad he managed to master that move Must be difficult to master it, huh? Not really... About that... Come here for a while What? Oh, good luck Sharlock... I can't do it, so don't force me ... The moves is just like this... Your body movement is like this... And like this... I'll show you one more time Move like this... And then like this Leg is the center of his power... Wong is also make that movement Yeah His movements are perfect and there's nothing wrong That's it! Polymar Suit that allows him to do that It's not because of the suit That suit relies on ability of the man who wears it It's not depend on the fighting style But... I know! Polymar Suit must have a recording system There's no such thing in the suit What did you just say? Yoroi thought so? He suspects that the Polymar System a recording program in it... Because nobody knows that move before Well then, further investigation seems to be needed How could the suit do that? It seems impossible if the suit could do that Unless... ...If there's something hidden inside the helmet We need to figure that out Yes I'll try to find out about that By the way, can you find a data about... ...People who involved in Polymar suits development? The member list... Yes Sir The red marked name is the one who had died in that project, right? Kitou Gouzou Saburo Horiuma Is Mr. Hori a former police officer? Yes Kitou Gouzou was on the Fund Development Both of them should be the key planners But what's the relationship between them? I'll have to figure this out Are you going by your self? Yeah, I won't be long... The data which you hold is just a small part... Try to get more information about it Yes Sir By the way, I forgot to ask you something Are you two engaged? Congratulation! Um, why suddenly... Must be Mr. Yoroi... Well, it's not like that ... Don't be shy It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong That's too bad I'm just kidding... Don't mention it... I'm just kidding... Still searching for it? Need a hand? Thank you, but... ...No need to bother... Okay then... See you tomorrow Good luck Yeah! Finally... I'm so lucky Saburo Horiuma, 58 years old His wife is Hori Midori And his son is Hori Akahiko There must be a picture of them This is... Oh, it's Kuruma, what's wrong? No, I'm not busy I'll be there at 6 p.m. Okay then Ouch... that hurts.. you pinched me so hard... Uncle, I have something to tell you... come here... What's that? I'm shocked... Gotcha! We fooled you again Why you... There's more I need to tell you Really? You must be lying right? This time is for real Are you sure? I like you Good girl... Mr. Hori Yes... - Are you the one who will pay for Mizuki Ikeuchi treatment? - Yes Thank you very much My sister's daughter has been sick for a long time... She has heart disease ever since she was born... Three years ago, my sister and her husband passed away... So I'm taking care of her daughter now That's why you entered an illegal fight, to pay for her treatment Surely your life is hard all this time... After being left by your father, who was a former cop Mr. Saburo Horiuma... Isn't that right, Mr. Hori Akahiko? So you already knew I looked into it, and I confirmed... ...That your father was the former direct supervisor of Director Tokita Yeah That old man who took care of me since I was a kid Did you know that... ...Your father participated in the Polymar development project? No, I dont I fought with my father until I left home... Fought? I don't remember much about it... My father... Taught me Hurricane martial arts since I was a kid His hard training... ...Makes me become stronger just like now.. I can see that I'll keep doing it... ...Until I see my father again... You've missed a chance that I gave you A chance? I believe that you can do this job properly Why should I do that? It was Mr. Hori's last will before he died Your father really loved you That's why he gave this chance to you You should appreciate that Those words... ...Are the words of a man who values justice more than anything I feel kind of weird after hearing those words Anyway... I'm a man who still believes that You're really an interesting person The Polymar suit development... ...Is to be used to uphold justice It was designed using a voice recognition system to activate it By the way, I've already checked Kitou Gouzou's file He's an extreme philosopher who believes that he must have that suit to gain power My father didn't want if the project to be misused That's why he developed the Polymar suit using voice locking system So it can't be misused So that's the story, huh? That's what I heard But... It doesn't make sense Believe it... Mr. Yoroi... No one can defeat the power of justice I'm afraid it will betray my feelings That's not true... The man who betrays Mr. Hori's trust is... ...Commander Yashiro. He used the system for his interests... ...By copying the data of the suit He sold it to a crime organizations It seems like that old man knew about it for a long time I think so Sorry, I forgot to call someone That old man, huh? Onigahara School? I don't think I've made an appointment with him to meet there How come you forgot if you've made an appointment? Director! Old man! Director! Old man! Old man! Director... Why did all this happen? He must've been killed... ...Because he knew too many secrets... Did you know that... ...That old man wasn't good at shooting guns... Also, senior of his partner has been the culprit all this time... It must be hard to believe, right? At that time... ...He came to see my father, to tell him who the real culprit was ...And that was when I met him... ...For the first time... "Hey, take a look at this..." "As long as there's evil in this world, The Light of Justice is My Power!" That's why he chose that word... I used to really wanna be a hero That's the source of his hope "And you said to me, "Everything will be okay"" "Everything will be okay" "Uncle, you're a nice man, I will definitely protect you..." "Are you sure I said that?" "That's right... You were a good boy in the past" "And I'm still a good man until now" "Your words give me power..." I always remember what he said But it's all too late... No, it's not too late at all I finally understand... ...Why Director Tokita... ...Trust in you, Mr. Yoroi... This is so bad, there are two men here and no one can do this Okay, that should be working... By the way, what film is in the video tape? It must be a romantic drama movie, huh? Let's see then... What video is this? It looks like Police Department and the Self-Defense Forces friendly match No one can defeat my father for 20 years What did that man eat? An apple? It's Mr. Kitou "Are you ready?" "Yes!" "Get set!" "Fight!" Awesome It's hard to believe that this was a recorded TV broadcast of that time... I'm confused about what secrets are stored in this video... Hey, isn't Kitou dead? Yeah, hold on a minute 3 years ago, after his involvement in the development of Polymar suits for radical movements was revealed... ...He slipped and died on the spot... Mr. Yoroi... He looked so sad... ...And the funny thing is, he cried like a baby at the police cemetery That sounds funny I've told you that you two will be a good partners No, that's impossible You must have worked really hard... But, both of you can help each other That's absolutely not gonna happen About the necklace that you gave me... ...The chain is broken... I'm really sorry Never mind, it's just a small gift from me Just a moment... Joichi... Get here quickly... This is really bad! What's so bad? Hello? This place is so quiet, and a bit suspicious Who are you? Miss Rei... Useless... You can't let it go So you're the one who did it all this time? Reality is really hurts, right? You like my body, don't you? Why... ...Why did you do all this? "Joichi... Get here quickly... This is really bad!" I have successfully hacked and recorded the voice from the original Polymar system What a pity... You're very easy to be tricked... Isn't your wish to be with me? Why don't you look so happy? Why are you doing this? Don't tell me that the man's move has been... ...No way! The moves in that Polymar suit... ...All that man's movements have been recorded Into Polymar helmet that I made... Helmet that you made? All that data... ...The movements and everything... That is... ...In order to get all the data... ...And created perfect Polymar suit for me... First is the kick movements... ...And then the punch movements... Is that so? That time... Yes, it was me who took it back You didn't expect it, right? You tricked by using us... ...And kill those two guys... That's right And even to make Takeshi Yoroi became a Polymar... ...That was my goal... I also hired Bullet Wong... ...And told you the man behind that Polymar suit Everything is according to my plan kau pasti merasa kecewa dan sangat sedih bukan saat ini What the heck all of this... You must be very disappointed now, right? And now I will also put this on you too So the helmet which is lost at that time... Of course... I'm the one who took it back... Now I'm just waiting for another set of Polymar suits until it's finished ...With all the data from previous fight... ...And also the data that is on Takeshi Yoroi... Unlocking a voice recognition password is not a difficult thing to do... ...To get the strongest Polymar suit... Don't tell me that... ...Your purpose for doing all this is... That's right! To get revenge! And also for my goal... "And never fall into the hands of criminals anymore" Why did you do all this? See... Joichi must have been shocked... My plan was successful, right? Yes, you're really smart... Wow, looks like we have a guest... ...Your savior... Be careful... ...This place seems dangerous... Instead, a dangerous place makes me even more excited Just as a thought, it's Kitou's men Teru, are you okay? Behind you! What the heck! Get away from me! Don't come close! Hey Detective Chief, look there's a camera I see... Hey, do you hear me? Is this the best you can do? Show me your face! Do you hear me? Transform and show to the buyers around the world... ...The power of the Polymar suit... Please, stop all this Tell me Miss Rei... ...Why did you take side with evil? "Take side with evil" you said? Are you stupid? Sorry, but the Polymar suit's power is more valuable You're such a pityful Preparation is complete for the last data No way... Okay, let's go Joichi! Sharlock So you're behind all of this, Rei Hieda... I mean... ...Rei Kitou... So you knew already Yeah... ...And also you're the one who killed that old man... What? In that old man's video tape ... At first I didn't know... What secrets are stored in it But after watching it carefully... "Daddy..." You are Kitou's daughter That old man had learned it all... ...From the scars on your neck... And the last one is... You disguised Joichi's voice and called that old man... "No way you..." Teru already solved it... She also implanted a device inside your necklace... ...A small video camera... Camera? The camera records everything that happened... ...Even your computer's password too... I know everything Your father is a criminal You're just a puppet controlled by him I don't trust you... Children are very easy to be fooled... Your father also used that little heart That's impossible... That's impossible... That's impossible... That's impossible... That's impossible... Daddy... Daddy couldn't possibly do it all... Polymar Transformation! Take back your words Shut up! Hurry up transform! So that's what you wanted To show the fighting abilities that Polymar suits have to your buyers who are criminals That's right Fighting data is the most important thing, so transform now! Mr. Yoroi! Detective Chief, hurry up transform! That's right! How long can you endure? Okay, I'll do it if that's what you wanted... ...Because I really like fighting too... Detective Chief! Polymar Transformation! As long as there's evil in this world, The Light of Justice is My Power! My daddy loves me so much! And I would do anything to make him happy That's enough! Please stop it! Stop it! Get off Joichi! Is this what you wanted Miss Rei? She has fallen into darkness... Please... Please come back like you used to Don't interfere me... Stop! Miss Rei... Why? Why did you do this Miss Rei? Daddy... I did it all for daddy's sake... Joichi! Are you okay? Sharlock... Daddy, I've got the data... Wait for me... What... What are you going to do? Once Polymar data is complete, we are no longer needed Are you going to blow yourself up? Please stop it, Miss Rei! Joichi! Sharlock! Don't do it, this has nothing to do with you You can't bear it all by yourself, Miss Rei! Miss Rei! It's all has something to do with me... I... I just don't want you to get involved with them... I'm sure she already knows how you feel for her Is that so? Yes, definitely Teru, please take care of Joichi There's still something I must do... I'm going to face her father... Father? Kitou is still alive... All data from the suit has been secured and ready to be sold en masse So you are Yashiro You like apple, huh? It tastes so sweet Kitou Gouzou... You throw away your old face and change it with a new one... At first I couldn't guess that you were him... Your goal is to get Polymar suit for your own sake... You do plastic surgery and change your identity... My goals have all been achieved completely... ...By making Polymar as a weapon and sell them worldwide My father had guessed it For the sake of revenge, you willingly sell your soul to the devil Hori's son was indeed great I will do anything to get my revenge Indeed you will do anything for the sake of your revenge Even your own daughter has become a victim of your hatred It was her duty as a daughter... Duty as a daughter you said? No one forced her... She did all that sincerely... She was... ...A bearer of hope... And also... For me, her power is something... ...Valuable...
