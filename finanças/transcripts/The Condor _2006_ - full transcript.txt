[glass breaks] [car alarm] [store alarm] [panting] [accelerated heartbeat] [heartbeat stops] [audience cheering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome you to the West Coast Regional Championships. We've got quite a lineup today, with some of the greatest skateboarders in America, all competing for a spot in the semifinals. And Z-Man hits the boards and moves into first place! [Woman] Reuben! Oh. Hey, Sammi. What were you doing? Just screwing with his game. That dude's such a poser. That's still no reason to... Hey, uh, I got to go, huh? Hasta luego. You avoiding us, Reuben? Ha ha! Chato... ha ha. No, I'd never do that, homes. Of course you wouldn't, muchacho. We've nominated you for membership in our little club. [groaning] Back off, Chato! You okay, cous? Yeah, of course I'm okay, Tony. Uh, these guys are my friends, my neighbors. Some friends you've got there. Hey, I got no fight with you, Valdez, but your cous here lives in our hood. So what? We're only concerned with his safety, homes. It's not so safe to be a loner. Reuben's not your homey, and I don't want you bothering him anymore, ¿comprende? [Boy] Tony, they're starting. Your match, dude! Hurry! Cool. I'm through here. Heh. Hey, uh... Hey, Tony, wait up! It ain't over, pato! Hi, there, Sammi. ¿Qué pasa? I saw you out there, Tony. Feeling all macho now? Grrr! Oh, that was nothing. Hey, check out my board, the deck's all banged up. Yeah. I kind of noticed. So how about a new deck, Sammi, huh? I think I can hook you up. Here. Try this one. See this? I've reshaped the deck for maximum wind flow, then jiggered the trucks, for these new urethane wheels I designed, - which should provide smoother turning. - Okay, I get it. You're a genius. [Woman] Hola, Tony, Sammi. Mama. Papa. Didn't know you were coming. Antonio, you seemed so excited en la mañana, we wanted to see. So this is what you quit college for? Jorge, we're here to root for Antonio, not to lecture him. Esto es importante. Gracias, Mama. Yes, important. Yes, yes. This is all fine for right now. But what about your future? I was hoping you would one day join us in our research, like Sammi has. Papa, I just don't have the same interest in science and robotics as you do. It bores me. Our research helps a lot of people. Yeah, that's great. But I just want to ride my board. And whether you get it or not, this is what I care about. [Announcer] Next up is the winner of the West Coast Regionals two years in a row: Tony Valdez![applause] Okay, look, I really got to go. Antonio, before you go, I want you to have this. This has been in la familia for many generations. It has always brought us luck. Your condor necklace. [condor cry] Gracias, Mama. Te quiero, mi Antonio. Go and win. We'll talk more later. No doubt. Love you guys, too. Let's go, Jorge. Ladies and gentlemen, Southern California's own Tony Valdez! Go! Go! Go, Tony! I have to admit, our Antonio seems to be very good at this roller skate boarding. Sí, he's very good. I just worry about his future. This self-indulgent attitude of his is not good. I know, but he's young. He's never had to struggle for anything. Sometimes I worry we made things too easy for him. Ha ha! [Man] Ah, George, Maria. I had the hardest time tracking you two down. Wow! That is amazing! Nigel, that's my Antonio. I never would have imagined that skateboarders are such wonderful athletes. Why are you here, Nigel? I've been contacted by some people that are very interested in our research. I wanted to see if I could convince you to speed up your tests, George. Valtek Robotics is committed to not taking short cuts in testing. If we are to help people and not harm them, we have to make sure we are very thorough. Now, if you don't mind, I'm watching my son grinding some copes. George, I really need you... [phone rings] ¿Qué? [Man] Mr. Valdez? Yes? I have some important information regarding your business partner. Really? You'll want to examine a folder that I've uploaded to your company computer. Okay. I'll be right there. Something important has come up. I have to leave. Now? But Antonio's turn is almost finished. It can't wait. I'm sure Tony and Sammi can drive you back. We'll talk later. I hope so, George. I'd really like the opportunity to change your mind. Adios. [cheering] Woo-ha-ha-hoo! And Tony Valdez moves easily into first place. You did it! All right! Was there ever any doubt? Tony, you're the... Best, dude! Tony Valdez, for the third straight year, you've won the prelims for the Southland's best skater. What are you gonna do now? I'm going to GA Sports on Third and Main for SoCal's best skateboarding gear. Hee hee hee hee! Hee hee hee hee! And cut. That was great, Tony. I'll see you tomorrow at the finals, huh? [Woman] Tony Valdez. I've had my eye on you, and I like what I've seen so far. Woo-hoo! Tony! Whoa! Mmm. Love your moves. Got any others? Uh, who are you? Valeria, and I publish the biggest extreme sports magazine around. I've decided to make you a superstar. I'll pick you up for dinner, and we can discuss it over breakfast. Muy pretido. And Dad said I was wasting my time as a skateboarder. Ha ha ha ha! [Man] Lower your flag, Valdez. Tomorrow you're going down. That championship and that fine lady's gonna be all mine. You heard her. I'm a superstar. Ha ha! Yeah, right. This is exciting. We can talk all about it as you and Sammi drive me back to work. That's cool. Come on, let's go. Caray! He knew these weren't ready to test on humans! What was he thinking? What was who thinking? Antonio! I'm so sorry I had to leave early. Did you win? Shh! Was there ever any doubt? I'm the best there is. Ah, you should have seen him. Magnifico! Maria, we have to talk... alone. No problem, Mr. V, Mrs. V. I'll show Tony what I'm working on. Take good care of him, Samantha. I always do. Come on, Champion of the World. Uh, This should be real exciting. What is the matter, Jorge? We have a problem, Maria, muy grande. We're focusing our efforts on nanotechnology, the ability to build products of any size with atomic precision. We're developing nanobots that will work on the molecular level in the bloodstream and act as an adrenaline booster. And I'm studying the possibility of using these same nanobots to promote self-healing. With any luck at all, these breakthroughs will be a huge benefit to man. Sounds, uh, great. I didn't mean to bore you with my research and all. Aw, come on. You know I couldn't care less about this junk. Yeah, I know. It's all about Tony! Uh, look, I gotta get some sleep. Tomorrow's match and everything, huh? Right. See ya then. [Maria] I don't understand what this all means. [George] It's only a matter of time before the police find out about the illegal experimentation on humans. There's going to be some serious trouble. [police siren] [Man] Stop or we'll shoot! Drop to the ground and put your hands behind your head! Drop to the ground! Now! [policeman] Oh, my God. [grunting] [deep synthesized voice] Another failure. Their bodies are still rejecting the procedure. We need stronger test subjects. [Nigel] Not a problem. I think I know exactly where to find them. What about the cash? Forget about it. This was just intended as a test. There's more money than that to be gained if we succeed. That was jammin'. You got that right. Whoa, I'm tankin'. See you guys tomorrow. All right. Be cool, dudes. Yeah. Hey, let's go ride some rails. Yeah. Just don't sack it like you did last time. Hyah! Ahh. These should do perfectly. What you talking about, man? Yeah, dorkwad. Ahh! Ahh! Today's the big race? Something like that. I'd really like to talk to you later about possibly going back... [honk honk] [brakes screech] [loud hip-hop on radio] You're so smart. All your professors said so. Sorry, Papa. I'm perfectly happy with what I'm doing. But you could help us do so much good for the world. Good? You hypocrite! The only help you need is help staying out of prison. What are you talking about? You're afraid the police are going to find out about your illegal activities. That's not true! You don't understand. We were... Can it! Let's roll out. Dios mio. He must have overheard us talking yesterday. What do you mean? He misunderstood and thinks we're the ones doing something illegal. [gasp] What are we going to do? Ah, before there are any more misunderstandings, we need to talk to Nigel. He should have a chance to explain. Let's go. Everything will work out for the best. I'm sure you're right. [Announcer] Our seventh round is about to begin. Oh, damn it, I'm gonna be late. Hurry up, cous. You don't want to miss me kicking Z-Man's butt. Uh, uh, sure, Tony. Uh, I'll be right with you. Z-Man, you're the East Coast champ, but Tony's the best in the west. You really think you can beat him? Man, I'm not only gonna beat him. I'm gonna mash, whip, and fry him. When this thing is over, Tony Valdez is gonna be one flat tortilla. Tell 'em, ladies. [in unison] Z-Man's "z" greatest! Z-Man's "z" greatest! Tony, did you hear? Berto... And Filipo are missing. Last night, we were grinding on some rails. They never went home, dude. Nah, they'll show. They won't want to miss me tweaking that poser. Mm... whoa. I was hoping to see you again. Oh, don't worry. I told you. I'm making you a superstar. Your future is gonna be my life mission, with fringe benefits, of course. Hey, Tony. How about an interview? Well, why not? Tune this up for me, will ya? Sí, jefe. So why's a babe like you hangin' with a loser like him... Hey... when there's a real man available? The only loser here is you. Uhh! Ohh! all right, you win. You want a victory kiss? What an ass. Thanks for noticing. Ohh! [Nigel] I really think you're overreacting, George. Are you denying you authorized testing on human subjects? There are always acceptable losses when a scientific breakthrough is this close. These aren't acceptable losses. These are human beings! And now the race you've been waiting for: longtime rivals Tony Valdez and Z-Man race off in our final competition. I have buyers ready right now that will pay us more money than any of us could have hoped to see in our lifetimes. We just need to be ready when they are. That's not why we started this company! I wouldn't do anything rash if I were you. Valtek Robotics and your reputations will suffer if this gets investigated. That's a chance we'll have to risk. We will not be accomplices in murder. We're going to the police. Goddamn self-righteous humanitarians! Taipan, I was just thinking of you. I think they're going to be a problem. [Taipan] Nothing our new recruits can't resolve. Ahh! Jorge! Aah! Aah! [Maria] Aah! Aah! That's a bad stroke of luck for our local... Tony! You all right, man? Yeah, I'm fine. The truck must have busted. The truck didn't break, which means the wheels couldn't fall off, unless the bolt's messed with. I'm going to kill him. [phone rings] Yeah? [Man] Tony Valdez? Yeah, I'm Tony Valdez. Your parents were in a car accident. They need your help. No. That can't be! My father's a careful driver. Where did it happen? The flood control channel near Highway 14. Give me your keys. Berto? Filipo? Oh, crap. [Sammi] Tony! Tony? I'm staying with him. You can go get some sleep. I'll call you when I have some news. What happened to your eye? Uh, it's nothing. I just fell, huh? Call me later. [Nigel] Of course. Everything's on schedule for our meeting. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Well, it seems my new guinea pigs are working out just fine. They're definitely able to handle the stress a lot better, but I'm not sure for how long. Just as long as they make it till Thursday night. After that, I couldn't give a damn what happens to them. There still seems to be a few loose ends, hmm? [grunting] ¿Qué pasó? You had quite a night. The doctor says you're gonna be... okay now. Oh, no! Aah! Oh, this is so hard for me. The doctor said... he said there's a good chance that you may never walk again. [gasp] But, Tony, I've been thinking about it, and I think if I utilize the nanotechnology research Valtek has been doing and I adapt it... Stop it! Just shut it! Just leave me alone! [Tony] Hey, I'm glad you came back. [Valeria] Of course. You're my superstar. All you need is some TLC, and I'll take care of you like nobody else can. Mm, you're just what I needed. [bell rings] And this was supposed to bring me luck. [Nigel] I'm so sorry, Tony. Your parents were wonderful people. I... I couldn't have asked for better partners. Muchas gracias, Nigel. Have the police found anything? No. They think it was just an accident, but I know Berto and Filipo must have... Tony, I hate bringing this up right now, but I was wondering if your parents ever mentioned the research they were working on. I never really cared what they did, Nigel. Yes, well, you see, I can't seem to figure out what their last few experiments were. You know, now that they're dead, I can't see as how it really matters. Do we need to talk about this now? No. Of course not. So... how are you doing? Let's see, my parents just died, and the doctors say I'll never walk again. I guess that rates a great. They were such good, kind people. They always made me feel like I was a part of tu familia. I was so thrilled when they allowed me to stay in their guest house. And I just... [Valeria] Uh, this party is just too depressing. Really, is this any way for a superstar to spend his afternoon? Right. Uh, Sammi, you remember Valeria, don't you? You almost got away from me. Well, I wouldn't want to do that. Don't worry, sweetie. I'll have you up and ready for therapy in the morning. Mmm. Now, you take good care of my Tony. I have... special plans for him. Hola, guapa. Oh, so, cous, where's this physical therapy dude? [chuckling] I was watchin' the sun set. You should try to do it every day. Good for the Chi. Aloha, Tony. They call me Dogg. You're my physical therapist? I'm Reuben, Tony's cousin. Hmm. Huh. Now, let's see. They've removed the Fixator brace and put you in something a little more conventional. Mm, this should be a piece of cake. Hee hee! And I love cake. No fooling. Hey, you're gonna hurt him. You sit down. You must have trust. Okay. Let's see what you can do. You loco? I can't walk. Hmm. You must first walk in your mind. The legs will follow. Walk in my mind. That makes absolutely no sense. ♪ I know I can trust you ♪ I know I can trust you I give up. Can't do it. You can't do it because you don't want to do it. [Sammi] Maybe this will help. Uh, those look dangerous. You betcha. You might feel a little sting at first, but that should go away. What are you doing? I combined your parents' research with mine. So those pin pricks you felt, they're computer probes dispersing nanobots into your bloodstream that are designed to knit your torn tissue and broken bones. Robots? Uh, somebody stop her. She's putting robots in me. Oh, grow up. I said nanobots. As the level of power increases... you can adjust the power level remotely... your strength will increase, and these sensors will register and anticipate every move you make and will compensate for balance and weight distribution so falling's not even a possibility. Uh, Sammi, en ingles, por favor. Tonys wobble, but they won't fall down. Hey, these actually work. Of course, it's still experimental, and you shouldn't increase the power too much. And you'll need these for a while. Hm-hm, very cool. It's as if he's had the benefit of six months of my therapy already. Thank you. I still want to do some more experimenting, but these should do for now. Come on, let's test out these babies. What's wrong? I was on my way to being a superstar, and now look at me. You're on your feet again. How wonderful. What else can you do again? Why don't we go and find out? Mm, I've got really big plans for you. Oh, uh, thank you for bringing him to me... Jimmi. That's Sammi. Cusca. You want me to steal his crutches and beat her over the head with them? You? Haven't you done enough damage? Get away from me. Hey, he walks out on you, and I'mscum? You sabotaged his wheels. Excuse me? No way! I beat him fair! Well, I would've if he hadn't have slammed, but I had nothing to do with his mechanical malfunction! Look, let me buy you a coffee, get to know the real me. No, thanks. I've seen the real you. No. That's all just an act. Sponsors love bad boys, and the badder Z-Man is, the more endorsements I get. Zeb Zubermann. Now with 50% less evil. Ha ha ha ha ha! Okay, Zeb, now with 50% less evil, let's go get some coffee. [Nigel] Ah. My new Wild Riders: strong and virile athletes. In spite of all that, they still won't last long. At least long enough for us to get rich and out of the country. [grunting] You're nothing like what I thought you were. Thanks for being such a good listener. My pleasure. [Young women] Z-Man! I really, really, really... You are awesome! I'm so excited to meet you! Oh, my God! Here, sign this, please! I really want your autograph! I've just wanted to meet you for so long! Aah! Me, too? Where do you want me to sign? Whoop! Sorry. Maybe next time. Whew. You are so sexy when you're mad. Shut up. Come on. Tony must have told you how beautiful you are. Yeah, right. Huh. Man, he's a bigger ass than I thought. [Nigel] These computer sims show the nanotechnology and DNA regeneration project your parents were working on before their untimely death. It appears the project was dangerously flawed. In fact, if they had ever tested this on a live subject, it would have resulted in death. Apparently, your parents were planning to hide that fact so they could sell it privately. I'm sorry I'm the one who has to show you this. I don't understand. Why would they do this? Did you know Valtek had lost its government contracts, and the federal grants had long since run out? That's why I had been brought in as a partner initially. [Sammi] Tony, that's not true. I don't know why you're saying these things, but there's no way... Sammi, stop. I overheard Dad. I'm pretty sure they did test this technology, and they were worried about the police finding out. No! I don't believe it. I'm afraid they might have been trying to leave town when they had their accident. Give me time. Let me check the data. Maybe I... Okay. You can look into it, but I don't want their names involved in a scandal, and you shouldn't, either. They're gone. You can start lurking about. He's definitely outlived his usefulness. Should I kill him now? You better make that both of them. [grunting] This hurts. Good! Hee hee hee! Now go faster. So where's Miss Silicone? I hear Oz wants to sell her a new brain. Trust me, she ain't Miss Silicone. She's Miss Natural. Remind me to laugh later. Look, I don't know why I'm doing this, but here. A skateboard. What a perfect gift for a person that can barely walk. Here I thought you had no sense of humor. No, you idiot. Just watch. This is something brand new. I built it with circuitry that perfectly complements your new braces. There's also magnetic grip tape, nanoglide trucks, RPM booster neoprene wheels, recess grips for melon and mute grabs, and it even folds up flat for easy storage. I also designed a new helmet with night vision, amplified acoustics, cell phone, and a remote to help control the power in your boots. Uh, why did you do all this? [Z-Man] Yo, Sammi. Why is he here? You almost ready? Our reservation's for 8. Fancy, a reservation. Qué tipazo. Just a minute. You thought you'd never skateboard again, so I designed something even a baby couldn't fall off. I'm not a baby. I don't need you to help me walk or skate or do anything else, ¿comprede? The body heals only after the mind heals. What the hell's that, sushi wisdom? No good reason ever to be angry. Really? Let's see. I've inherited a company I know nothing about. The two guys who jumped me are still running around. Nobody seems to care, and if I wasn't wearing these things, I couldn't even walk. That's already three good reasons to be pissed. You want more? Sit. I don't want to. Okay. Sitting is good. Ten years ago, in Maui, there was a champion surfer. He rode the waves like Duke Kahanamoku himself. There was no one better. But then something happen, and he can surf no more. Yeah? What? Gamblers wanted him to lose a big competition. He said no, and he rode to win. They tried to kill him but failed. He wanted to hurt them back, but his body was too broken. The bad men got away. Life's a bitch. He felt sorry for himself. He thought the world hated him. But he met a beautiful wahine, and soon he learned he did not have to feel sorry all the time. And then his body healed. Today he surfs. Today he is happy. The body cures only after the mind heals. ♪ I know I can trust you Works every time. Hee hee hee hee hee! ♪ I know I can trust you ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh ♪ I know I can trust you ♪ [chanting] ♪ I know I can trust you ♪ [chanting] ♪ I can trust you Aah! Dude, you okay? That's got to hurt. Hey, Reuben! Where are you going? I'll see ya later. I got business. [gasp] Berto? Filipo? Where've you guys been? Take them. Uhh... run! What happened to them? I don't know. Let's find out. I have two more. Don't worry about Valdez. Tony? I have special plans for him. [beeping] Yeah. Tony, it's Fragg. And Skragg. Some gang attacked us. And Berto and Filipo were with them! Berto and Filipo! And one of them... Was talking about you! Where are you? The skateboard park. Aah! Aah! Fragg. Skragg. Take them with the others! [Tony] The hell you will! What? This is none of your business! Now back off! I'm making it my business. You can consider yourself lucky. Stay out of my way! I think you guys are safe now. This is so cool! And awesome! Wait till we... Tell everyone! You've just made a very dangerous enemy. Ahh... [condor cry] [screeching] [screech] Beware The Condor! Or something like that. Yee-ha! Oh, The Condor lives! Ha ha ha ha! [Policeman over radio] Got the suspect in sight. He's turning the corner on Arvelos right now. One unit is in pursuit. Aah! Nice night for a drive, isn't it? Hola, ladies. Using a missile launcher to bust into a pawn shop? Talk about a little overkill. Uhh! I could get used to this. That's 50 to you, hombre. Hey, I'm all in, and another 2 Gs... uh, if you'll, uh, spot me. I don't know. I don't want your big-shot cousin comin' down on me. Ah, don't worry about him. He ain't got no huevos anymore. He's just a gimp! Muy bien. You're covered. Show. Ha! Full boat: Jacks over 6s. I win. Not so fast. Four Kings. Okay, pay up. What? Uh... um... how'd you... You're not accusing me of cheatin', are you, bro? Me? No. No, of course not. It's no problema. You'll get your money. 24 hours. Man, am I glad you called. Me, too. You sure seem to be recovering quickly. What type of physical therapy are you doing? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. I have an idea. I have the most incredible beach house. Why don't we go after dinner? Warm water in the moonlight. Nobody for miles. You don't even need a swimsuit. Sounds, uh, perfect. You have no idea. I'll be right back. [phone rings] ¿Qué? [Man] Valdez, I'm the one that murdered your father and mother. Murdered? Who is this? Ten minutes, 17th and Brewster. Hello? Hello? When my date comes back, tell her something came up and I had to leave. [gasp] [Tony] Dios mio. I've been set up. Huh? That felt good. Number 2 coming up. Ouch. That looks sharp. It's payback time. You again. Where did you hide Valdez? I've had enough of this. Berto? So! Instead of going to the police like his parents, Valdez found himself a skateboarding bodyguard. Now you're getting personal. Aah! Uhh! Oh, I am so gonna sell this for a gazillion bucks. Ah, now that's not fair. Don't you ever shut up? Now, that really hurts. Didn't anyone ever teach you manners? Gotcha! Thank you, Mr., uh... You can call me The Condor. Thank you, Mr. Condor. Ahh! This isn't over. You can count on it. Sorry, pal, but I think I'm gonna need this. [brakes screech] What the hell happened here? [TV news reporter] And these amazing photos, taken by 11-year-old Francisco Garcia, show the Southland's mysterious new hero fighting what witnesses insist were zombie-like skateboarders. Another bystander says he calls himself The Condor. He risked his own safety to save my granddaughter. All fled as police arrived, leaving the body of one of the skateboarders. He was declared dead on the scene due to a massive heart attack and a brain aneurysm. [knock knock] Tony! Dios, what happened?! I think it might be time these boots had a tune-up. Damn skateboard clown helped him escape from you again? [Taipan] I'll deal with his bodyguard later. As for Valdez, I already have that plan in motion. You better have. And you better find a replacement for that Rider you lost! Trust me. I've got that covered. [Tony] Sammi, a prisa! What's taking so long? You have any idea how long it takes to build these things? I need to get going. That snake guy killed my parents before they could talk to the police. I have a score to settle with him. Oh. Ahh... So you no longer think they were running away. It's about time. Ahh... Ow. I know. I couldn't see what was perfectly obvious to you. Couldn't have been involved in anything illegal. Ow. There might be hope for you yet, Antonio Valdez. Uh, hey, I almost forgot to show you this. I took this off of Berto. Hmm. That's strange. This is very similar to something we were developing at Valtek. Ese, I was looking for you, Tony. Uh, I need 2,000 bucks, like, right now. Whoa, what type of trouble are you in? Oh, I did something really stupid, and Chato says he's gonna cut me real bad if I don't pay up. Tony, por favor... No, man. Chato is bad news. He doesn't want your money. He wants to own you. You're turning me down? Come on, cous, we're familia. You can't. Trust me, you need to go to the police. No. You don't understand, okay? I can't drop a dime on him. That would get me killed! You have to get out of that neighborhood. I can help you. It's too late, man. They jumped me into the gang. I'm a member. Let me help you. Help me? You never helped me. All you ever did was get me in deeper. I ain't surprised that you're useless now. Man, I'm glad I screwed with your board and made you lose that stupid meet. Man. I cannot believe it was him. Ah, hell, maybe I deserved it. I should've helped him get out of that neighborhood before it was too late. You can't save everyone, Tony. They have to want to be saved. [phone rings] ¿Qué? You ditched me at the restaurant. Where'd you go, lover? Uh... I'm sorry. Something came up. Well, you can make it up to me by coming to my beach house like you promised. Um, right, um... I'm sorry, Val. I forgot. We really need that interview. The magazine is waiting to be sent to the printers. Sure. I can be there. I did promise, and I can't just blow her off because it's inconvenient for me. Could I? No, no, of course not. Look, I'm sorry. This won't take long. [door opens] Great. Now he's suddenly becomes someone you can depend on. Hi, Val. I'm sorry. I didn't realize the interview couldn't wait. Of course it can wait. I can't. What's the matter, baby? Do you really need to be interviewed to come see me? So how about that swim you promised? Sure. Good idea. Ah. Oh, a little nervous? I'm sure a nice moonlight swim is just what the doctor ordered. Afterwards, we can get nice and comfortable so I can finish my job. You? It's you? Well, now, what have we here? That's what I get for trying to mix business with pleasure. I thought you'd be even easier to kill than your parents were. I guess I shouldn't have let you out of my sight for a minute. Aah! Did that homely little bitch design these? Uhh... Is that how she shows her love for you? [gasp] Grrr! Yaah! Aah! [Dogg] Hmmm.[gasp] Where did you come from? Hee hee! One should always walk softly and apologize to the air molecules as you disturb them. I was hoping to find Tony here. Okay. Well, he's not here right now. He's with Valeria. What are you studying, Sammi? I'm remotely accessing the computers at Valtek to figure out what tests were being conducted. Hmm, DNA: the building block of life. That's what it normally looks like. This is it after it's been altered with nanotechnology. Wait a minute. The DNA pattern that all these tests were conducted on were Mr. Valdez', Tony's father. It looks as if all these nanobots were designed to work specifically with Mr. Valdez' DNA. If these nanobots are introduced to anyone else's DNA... It will put pressure on heart and adrenals. Brain functions would be re-routed. Heart is put in stress. Would cause death for sure. You're right. A test subject could live what, one, two weeks max? And that's only if the nanobots aren't induced to full power. Isn't this the same technology you used on Tony's boots? I never suspected they'd be a problem. I'm gonna run a sim on Tony's DNA. Because his DNA is so similar to his father's, it seems his system should be able to handle the nanobots better. Unless he powers them up too high or for too long. How do you know all this? Ah... I read before bed. I have to make a phone call. [gasping] Aah! Hyah! Aah! Huh! I told you I'd take care of you like no one else could. [chuckling] What are you hiding from?[gasp] Where'd you come from? Did Tony send you? Tony? Please, he's a wimp. It's you I've always been attracted to. Uh, me? You're messing with me. No, I couldn't stand the way he treated you. I've got an idea how we could get back at Tony. Uh-huh. No, not you. Come on. Look, that little girl would do anything in the world for you, and I'd do anything for her. Sammi? So when she asked me to keep an eye on you, I couldn't refuse. Next time, use both your eyes. Why doesn't it surprise me that Nigel's behind all this? Dios mio! He's planning on selling the formula to terrorists tonight! He will have to be stopped. I knew you had it in you. Mmm. Come on, lover, let's go. [gasp] Hurry! Sammi! [coughing] Is she okay? [coughing] So I can use the power that these boots give me and try to stop Nigel. And take a chance that the nanobots will kill you. Or let Nigel get away with selling my parents' technology and causing worldwide terror. [condor cry] I choose Option A. Okay. We are here as agreed. Where is this wonderful thing you promised? I assume you have the money? It will be wired to your off-shore account as soon as we are satisfied. Excellent! I thought a little demonstration might be in order. Aah! What... What is the meaning of this? Just my way of demonstrating the profound capabilities of what you're agreeing to purchase. [whispering] All is going exactly as I planned it. Exactly. [whispering] You have a deal. Wire the funds. Ah. You will not be sorry, gentlemen. I can personally guarantee that this will make you the most powerful... [slash] It's amazing how stupid some people can be. I'm sorry, gentlemen. There's been a slight change of plans. [Sammi] Tony, what's going on? There's been a few interesting developments. I'm going to have to go in right now! Don't! We're almost there. Sorry, chica. Can't wait. Nigel was such a small thinker. I'm going to keep this technology for myself, but for a fee I will supply you with as many soldiers as you might need. And all for three times the amount to ensure I won't be too quick to offer my services to your enemies! You! Did you miss me? I should've made sure the job was finished! This time I will! Aw, now you've gone and hurt my feelings again. Oh, man! You're a girl! Girl or no girl! That's one tough chick! Success! Uhh-aah! Uhh! Ahh... Now that's the old Tony I know and love! That's... not... gonna stop me. Well, would you look at that? You could have just walked away, but you had to be a superstar. A month ago, I probably would have walked away, but not now. Not ever again! What a waste. So long, lover. It's been a blast. Huh? Huh? [grunt] Val! Huh? Augh! Uhh! Aah! [groaning] Will my grandchild survive? I do not know. The child is hurt very badly. There is nothing I can do. [gasp] Use this. It... [cough]... will save me. Uhh... [coughing] [screeching] [Tony] I'll always regret all my selfishness, that I never had the chance to make it right between us. But you need to know, even when we argued, even when we fought, I knew you two were the most important people in my life. You see? First mind, then body. Well, ha ha ha! in your case, first body, then mind. And a good wahine. Reuben, espera. What do you want? We shouldn't end this way. Guess Tony Valdez doesn't always get what he wants. You've done everything you can. It's up to him now. If I were you, I'd listen to her, amigo. You got yourself a good one. But just 'cause you got the girl don't make you a better skater than me, dude. Don't bet on it. Woo-ha-ha-hoo!
