I haven't always been here. I mean, before... I was normal. Before it happened, I would have been there, on the couch, not over here, in mid-air, 91 cm from the couch... precisely 91 cm from where I should be. OK. Go on. It's all because of that thing! A 150-ton meteorite, for god's sake... It's bound to leave a mark. So, there was no actual damage after all, is that right? No damage? What do you mean? Well, just the aerial on the building opposite mine. And me. And me. Hello, hel...? 91 centimetres... I am exactly 91 centimetres from myself... Now, it's just a question of organisation. Got to be organised, that's all. At home, I've just about got things under control. It's OK. It's not so bad. But of course, you can't foresee everything. If this goes on, I can say goodbye to my job. I can't go on. Not like this. Alright, next time we'll come back to the asteroid. Meteorite, not asteroid! It's totally different! It's not that hard to grasp, an as... an as... an asteroid is when... An asteroid is when the... whatever... It's a whole different thing! It was a meteorite that crashed into me, nothing else! And all I want is... to get back to where I was. And quite clearly, you can't help me. Yes Mother... No, no, I can't hear you very well either. Listen, I've been thinking... Perhaps it's not such a good idea you coming to visit me now... No, I didn't say I wouldn't like to see you! It's just that... I've really got a lot on my plate... I'm absolutely swamped... Where do you think you're going? I'm not going to let you slip away. How are you feeling today? What brings you here, Mr. Debrus? Ah, I see, yes, indeed... So, there was no actual damage after all, is that right? How many centimetres did you say? Alright, next time... we'll come back to the asteroid... Hello Henry? Henry! I don't know what's got into you, but I'm starting to worry. Your Uncle John said he passed you in the street and you didn't even say hello! He got you your job, you know... Henry... They say it strikes one person in a hundred. One person, just like that... at random. That's all they told me. They never tell you how crazy you are. Just that you've lost it, that you're beside yourself... out of your mind. So a little bit more, a little bit less... what's the point of knowing... knowing how many centimetres you've slipped... The only thing I'm sure about now... is that from where I'm standing, it's not a bother anymore. Not anymore... I'm here! I'm here! Over here! No, not there... Over here! Hey! Oy! I'm here!
