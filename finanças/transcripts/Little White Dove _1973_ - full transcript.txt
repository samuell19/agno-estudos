LITTLE WHITE DOVE a film by RAÃšL RUIZ based on the novel "Little White Dove" by Enrique Lafourcade The production of this film was completed in 1973. For more than 17 years, the negatives remained hidden away. Good afternoon, Mireya. Colonial dependence, or national independence. Colonial dependence, or national independence. There are impossibilities. An appointment with history. The avengers. There's no turning back. This is progress. The 20th century. Chile in view. Help me out, pal! We beg you to excuse this interruption. Little window of remembrance. 7,500 for kidney beans! Tasty piglets for an entire week! The hour of truth. Those wretches raped her on Fifth Avenue, while the others were sleeping. I'm a spy. The Colo-Colo is eternal. The Colo-Colo is eternal. Colonial dependence, or national independence. Colonial dependence, or national independence. Three or four marihuana addicts. Another coup of the MIR. Another coup of the MIR. For the love of Natasha and for the love of love, How much do you know? It will happen soon in this room. In this room. In this room. Good evening, Santiago. The newspapers of the world are preoccupied with this long and narrow strip of land. I met him at the festival at Los Dominicos. A festival in the district Piedra Roja where there were only hippies. His name was Juan Carlos. He took us there and left, but it bothered me, because I was starting to like him. I saw him again and he asked me if I would come to his place, he was going downtown. I agreed and went with him. But then he changed his mind and asked if I wanted to go to the beach. I said I agreed, but first we went to his place. He had a tea and I drank a hot coffee. We ate pancakes with syrup. Together we drove to the beach. He got out of the car and told me to undress. I undressed and we took a swim. After that we got to the beach, we sat together and talked a lot. It went too fast and I got scared. We got to the beach, he got out of the car and told me to undress. I was ashamed because I had torn clothes and stuff. He by contrast had such beautiful clothes. But he got naked and went towards the beach. I realized he wasn't even looking at me. I got naked and followed him and we went bathing. Then we got out of the water and sat down for a while. We agreed quite a bit. That you should go to the beach when you like. Shouldn't be ashamed of being naked. That they should get married. Poor people to rich, black people to white. I told him I didn't live with my parents. He asked me where I studied and I told him where I studied. Told me to undress. He asked me stuff. Wanted to know about my father. I told him my dad had built the Tajamar towers. He asked me if he was an architect, I told him he was a builder. That he had fallen and died and that now I had a stepfather. On a certain occasion, a girl met a man. She was young and very poor, he was rich and handsome. They liked each other and hung out together. He took her to the beach, she accepted and they went over there. There they both got undressed and went into the water. He seemed to be different. Maybe that's why she felt attracted to him. Many things happened. They were both falling in love. And then they went to his house. Make yourself at home! There's no one here. I'll take a shower, then drive you home. - I can go on my own. - No, I'll drive you. - But I can go alone. - Don't think about it, I'll drive you. Then we went to Santiago. At 2 pm. He leaves me alone and goes off. He lies down, I go to see him. And since I see him lying down, I leave. His eyes were filled with tears. He turned his head and was watching them. Miss, don't bother him. He's sleeping. Please leave this way. But that's what you want to do. That's monstrous! No, Doctor, it's divine justice. But... that woman was married, before God and the law! My mom, as you know, is an alcoholic and doesn't have control over her acts, so I won't blame her, as she's an alcoholic, and doesn't know what she's doing. But as for my godmother, I will never forgive her for what she did. She went to tell my mom that she shouldn't wait for me on that road. She said that nothing bad could happen to me, as bad news is always known beforehand. So I will never forgive my godmother, even though she's very good to me. I actually love them all, despite what she did to me. Open the door! - You won't go anywhere! - Yes I'm leaving, godmother! - You won't go anywhere! - Yes, I'll go! - Oh dear! - What? Don't go anywhere! Yes, I'm going! - Another day would be better. - I'm going today! - Don't go, dear! - Yes I'm going! Eclair, bicycle, Clot... Cl... It's not true, my dove I will wait for you on every road. Hurry up, go to the chapel. And my heart will rejoice. - Can I come in? - Yes. - Let's get there! - Come out! It's alright. We're seeing it. There are many ways to fix this if you ask permission, respectfully, honoring your parents. Excuse me! The conjecture is, in harmony with all, let's see. If not there's war. And war is asked for by whoever wages it. Let's see, my dear. You want to go out? Go out. But with respect and dignity! Yes that's what's important, respect and dignity. Isn't it? If you don't want to ask for permission, don't ask for it. Nobody is telling you to ask for it, alright? The most important thing... The most important thing is to behave. To behave well. Not only do you have to behave. Not only does the little child have to, but also the elders, the men, the women and the children. Calm down! Don Fernando paid a bandit to kill Maria Isabel. The bandit made a mistake and killed his wife. Now both of them are in jail. Don Fernando was not at home when his wife died. He had gone to Europe to receive his inheritance. In Europe Don Fernando realized that he was deeply in love with Maria Isabel. Disgrace Each day more disgrace Maria Isabel has suffered a lot. She lost her husband and her child. She has been ruined and is penniless. Now he's in prison. But whilst we love each other there will be no anguish We can look at each other and even get used to the incomprehension They will never know that destiny is capable of bringing us together The world has turned us into a vile mirror And now we reflect on faraway disgrace First he kisses me, and I tell him that he shouldn't. That we shouldn't get together. And he... No, rather I tell him I don't want him as my boyfriend, that he should stay as my friend. No. I tell him I want to belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with me. No, I'll tell him I don't want to see him ever again. Never, never, never again. Why do they reject you? What do they have that you don't? There's no comparison with my folk. Mine are more open, more sincere. Here everything is false, totally false. If one wants to belong to the group, one has to pretend. - You need to learn and get used to it. - But how? There are good and bad everywhere. It's too hard to find good people in these surroundings. No, it's not so hard. Incredible. Right. Listen. It's incredible. - Look at this! - Girl! Look how that one looks! And that one! Frantic! There are lots of them! It's quite effective. It's really a pity. Listen, girl. Yes, it's been a while. - Well... - Hello! How are you? Hi. I've got five minutes. - Then I need to get back. - I see. - Are you buying this one? - Yes. His name is Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos is with Maria. I can't believe it. They're a couple. Yes? Love is something one feels which is why we give our soul and life to the one we love. For love is a gift. Over there in the oven the bread is being heated. The one who climbs a tree will cast a huge shadow. It is because of the shadow, my daughter, that they say that love is blind. Don't forget, my daughter, that the habit doesn't make the monk. Always do good, without considering who may benefit. Over there in the oven, the bread is being heated. Finally my godmother gives me permission. Juan Carlos takes me to the store. He introduces me to many people. Everyone is cool, especially his sister who asks me a lot of stuff. Great conversation. She owns a boutique and is Juan Carlos's sister. Sit down! Tell me, you met him a long time ago? No, actually relatively recently. 10 days ago, more or less. - And where did you meet him? - At a Dominican festival. - What kind of festival? - Music. - I have many memories regarding that festival. - What kind? Memories of a movie called Woodstock. Ah, is that where Joan Baez sang? And Jimi Hendrix and all those people? Exactly. Many memories. - Memories of what? - Memories of Juan Carlos. - But why? - I don't know. Juan Carlos talks to me a lot about Jimi Hendrix. Yes, he seems to like him. And what do you do? I study. - What course are you on? - 4th semester courses. - You're almost done. - Yeah I'm almost done. Who do you live with? Your dad or...? I don't have a dad, I have a stepfather. - And what does your stepfather do? - He had a taxi but he sold it. - What for? - To drink the money. - But what do you do for a living at home? They are in extreme poverty, no, I live with my godmother. She pays for my studies and all, she works a lot. - Do you live only with her? - Yes, only us. - And what does she do for a living? - She does some sewing and stuff. - She gets along well. - Of course. - And what do you plan to do when you're older? - I think of working. What at? Anything, so that I can help my godmother, like any girl would do. You can work with her, sewing clothes? No, I'd like to work in something that'd give more money. So she doesn't have to work. But don't you think you need to study for that? I don't know, maybe do a quick course, something like that.. And tell me something, have you known Juan Carlos long? Was this festival a long time ago, a short while? No, a few days ago. And do you like Juan Carlos? Yeah, I like him, he brings back lots of memories. - Of what? - Of many movies I've seen. Over there in the haystack. I won't consent to them taking the kids to Cuba, stuff like that. - Where I first saw you. - It's the first thing they do. - But why would they take them to Cuba? - To the communists, that's why! There are many poor children over there. Yes, and what's there that one can live off? I want to find you again. Again. Again. In order to stop suffering. I want to meet you once again. In order to stop suffering. - Come here if you can. - It's the sister. Come here if you love me. Please come here. Come here in order to become aware of it. So that my affection won't die. Come here in order to become aware of it. So that my affection won't die. Over there in the haystack is where I saw you for the first time. Why not putting up a business? Over there in the haystack. I know we will understand each other The circumstances are different. Especially when it comes to love. But I want to let you know, my dear, that I love you all, so don't think I don't love anyone. I'm not just a proud woman who doesn't love anyone. I ask you to accompany me, my dear, because I feel lonely and sad. The life we live with my godmother is very lonely. It's very nice, right? - Yes, really. - Look. Done. First of all, I want to ask you not to blame anyone for my death, since it's my decision. Life doesn't make sense to me. The reason for which I take this decision is that no one cares about me. I'm very lonely, godmother. I love you a lot but I've suffered a huge disappointment and can't keep living. When was this? When I fought with the German with the white car. No. I don't remember. - Yeah, you met him. - The blonde guy? - No not at all, he wasn't my boyfriend. - What was he then? - Nothing, we just laughed now and then. No, not at all, he touched my knee and that's all. - But also the arms. - And did he kiss your neck? - No. - No? - No I only let him touch my knee. But like that, with his hand, without taking a breath. - And tongue kisses? - Only with his tongue, not mine. I know that when I'm being kissed like that, I never let the breath escape. That's of little use, isn't it? It depends. If I'm being kissed like that, I just reciprocate the breath. Give it a try. Keep it there. Of course, on top of that the tongue moving in the mouth is a bit disgusting. But afterall it's not that bad. Keep reading the letter. That's why I'm going somewhere, so there's nothing left of me. You'll have to pick me up at Tiltil. Over there you'll find another letter on my body in which I explain the real reasons for this decision, which is mine and I decided it today, on November 15th. A little bit too long. Now read this one. No, this one. Juan Carlos, my love, firstly I wanted to say I'm yours forever. Take me in your arms, I love you so much. I want to say so many things, to always be at your side and live with you. No, that's poetry. We'll start in ValaraÃ­so and travel to Callao. We reach Callao. From there we travel to California. We reach California. We get there passing by Polynesia, Hawaii, etc. That's why I want to make contact with someone in California. Someone in the US that can help me get there. I have addresses of some friends. And the record? When are you getting home? I don't know. Tomorrow. I already know. And you? Well then. Well then, the idea is... Your brother lives there, doesn't he? Sure. On the other side. In New York. But I think he'd take the time to travel to California. - Will he be interested in going there? - It's been a long time since he saw us. - Yes? - Hell yes. Well, I don't know. - What does your brother do? - Publicity. He doesn't want to come back as things are. So you think he would like to meet with us? Yes, I guess so. I would really like to talk to him. Listen, what's his name? It's necessary to figure out if one should work there. Juan Carlos? But he's in New York. In the end I'm the one who makes fun of them. I know they try to make fun of me, and since I know they make fun of me, I make fun of them. But you know that it's the contrary. - Why? - Because they know very well they make fun of you. And you think they make fun of you, because deep inside they don't take you seriously. But on the contrary, I mean if they really knew you they would actually start caring about you. And there would be no need make fun of them. I don't know, but I make fun of everyone, even you. - You know that's unfair. - Why? Because deep inside we could have many more reasons to make fun of you. And you don't have as many reasons to make fun of us, understand? And we don't make fun of you with regard to all those things. I don't know, but I still make fun of everyone. I feel a little bit ashamed. Hey, how about that journey? Well, we'll board a ship in ValparaÃ­so and we keep navigating northwards, until reaching California. In California we'll stay for a few days, then keep going to Hawaii, then take another ship. - He's making fun of you! Don't you see? - Not at all! Look, I know he's making fun of me, and since I know he's making fun of me, I make fun of him! Only partially. I go to ValparaÃ­so in order to sing. Yes I do, Yes, I do. Ha, ha! Yes, I do. I hold you, 6 o'clock. - I understood that! - No but you didn't understand. Yes, I did know what you meant! You know what I said, but you're wrong because I didn't say it literally. But he's making fun of you right there! You're also making fun of me! Together with him. See the example of how we make fun of you? - But why are you making fun of me? - Because we do. I also make fun of him, of you, of everyone. Well, as you like. Today we're going to the disco. On our way we went in the following way. Front seats: A with H. Back seats from left to right: me, XX and M. And when we came back M was driving. Me and X. In the back: M, J and a small kid who's everyone's friend. Today I started writing this diary, My godmother was sick and it was very grave. Turn off the lights, please. My head hurts so much... Here's the lady. Don't move, don't move. Turn off the lights.. - Am I clean? - Yes. Please turn off the lights, please. And does your aunt know, Maria? No, I understand. What happened? I almost caught the patroness kissing the patron. I want to go to the bathroom. Turn off the lights! This house if full of mice, excuse me. - There's a mouse in there. - A mouse? The other day I also saw it. The other day for example, I found one over here. - There's a mouse down here too! - I'll kill it. No, let it be. You go downstairs. Please come here. Be silent! - What's happening? - Who's there? No one, lady. Good night. Good night. My Lord Jesus Christ, god and real man, let not a black car cross my path when I reach the Alameda. Let me not step on a disgusting thing, Christ my Lord may it be like that. One morning, smiling sky thinking of things from the heart 1, 2, 3, little white horse bad for you, good for me 1, 2, 3, little white horse bad for you, good for me An illusion brings its own fate and like the wind it fades away Rain drop, bus stop, lollipop Hop now on one leg Rain drop, bus stop, lollipop Hop now on one leg Listening just to the voice of her mind You know, little girl, I'm really worried because you've got a series of memory lapses. And that's not your fault. It's actually the teacher of each respective course that is to blame for this situation. For example botany, what do you know about it? A flower, you don't know the parts of a flower. I've noticed it. And botany is very important. You might say it has nothing to do with my course but it does, because it's all related. And for example botany is related to history. Of how great civilizations were built. So botany, applied botany. For example Mesopotamian culture, Egyptian culture is all related to botany. There are some teachers here who are just rich and crazy. For example the art teacher takes you to exhibitions of other rich, crazy women like her who just can't draw. Why don't they get their inspiration in real things, do you see that? Do you see what's happening out there? That's marvelous. That man, so simple, who's doing something without any pretension and it's a pure and marvelous work of art, at the same time. It's useful because it's a chair where one can sit. But all those ugly drawings of those old women, what's the use? They say it's just attraction, but it's not, it's nothing, it's just absurd. So I insist you should be dedicated and study deeply without taking into account your teachers, they don't care. For example, Chilean flowers are amazing Chile has some fantastic flowers. She says not in the north, the desert. Wrong, I've been in the desert! I've seen what happens in the desert, it's full of flowers. I've brought marvelous plants from the desert, even from outside Chile. We were in the desert once. When I was young I was studying, we went on a teacher's tour. And what happened? I went with a group of friends. There was a friend who had a camera and he made fools of us. He took some photos of us. He made us do some absurd poses and it turns out this joker didn't have any film in the camera. I realized that because I take pictures, thus I realized he took more than 60 photos without changing the film, so that was very suspicious. He also went to a hotel with the math teacher and made her undress, taking a series of nude pictures, telling her that he would publish them in a foreign magazine. I've actually told this anecdote several times and it has caused great hilarity. I don't know about you, but some people like this story a lot. And given an opportunity, at a birthday celebration, an aunt's birthday or at a friend's, they always ask me to tell this story. Regarding my mother, she's kind of mentally sick, so she might confuse me with a saint. I come to the house and she falls on her knees. So the problem I have with my mother is serious, thus I bought her two TVs and have her watching TV all day. Sometimes I put two different channels on at the same time, so she sticks to that fake world and lets me live my life. So I can dedicate myself say, to my experience to prepare my musical shows and to occasionally meet some girlfriends. Because that's really important. Now I recommend you to do things that are unusual. For example, to suddenly wake up at 3 am and go for a walk. That's such a nice thing. If you haven't done it, do it. It's the most wonderful thing, you go out, start to walk toward the mountain, and wait for the sun to rise. It's really nice, you breathe fresh air, you see the empty streets, your mind clears. That's what you need to do, and other stuff. Do you get it? Let me mention this problem, for example, that we recently encounter a lot, which is all doctors being bandits. My mom wanted me to become a doctor. Life circumstances made me become a music teacher and music is my only interest. I would never accept to capitalize on human suffering, even though I've got lots of family members who are doctors. Uncle Ruperto studied medicine for 20 years. He graduated finally and is making good money. He has three cars and wants me to work with him. Many times he's said: "I can get you in here." I'll never accept that, never. I'm only interested in the simple things of life, like that marvelous thing that is happening out there. That man outside his house who's painting without any pretension. That amazing thing, simple and also comfortable. It's something on which he, or his wife, or a friend may sit. I beg you to take a look, but be very, very calmly, without making any noise. So that no other teachers start gossiping that there's disorder in here. So you take a look. See? This leaf I'm going to show you is also an amazing thing. Simple and natural. Whales for example, have any of you seen a whale? That's the most marvelous thing, they eject water! They are amazing beings. Now whales have disappeared in all the parts of the world. Where are they conserved? In Chile! Thanks to the 200 mile policy. The territorial defense of 200 miles that permits whales to have a sanctuary because no pirates from any part of the world can hunt whales over here. Well, girls, all I've been telling you till now is theory, because reality is something totally different. When you go out and start living, you'll encounter many problems. and you'll realize, for example, that even if you try, make an excellent effort in certain fields of art or science, you'll never reach the highest peaks, that means Wagner. I've actually discussed this a lot with my mother, because she's a fan of Bach, but Wagner is a high peak humanity will never reach again. It's something really incredible and I recommend that you... The bell has rung so I ask you to leave quietly, because you know how they gossip about me. They even say there are orgies in my course! So please leave slowly and calmly. I love you, Juan Carlos. I told him before, but now I can't say it Something like "I love you", I can't say it now. The problem is that ruling class which has the mass media at its disposal makes use of this media in order to manipulate the suppressed class. Therefore the suppressed class is taught about values by the ruling class, being absorbed by these values. Now, what happens if a girl that belongs to the suppressed class dates someone from the ruling class? Without a doubt, for a while she feels like all of her dreams and objectives came true, given that she's influenced by the values of the ruling class through mass media. So that's the problem with mass media. But undoubtedly she'd have some neurosis as she can't be absorbed by the values of the ruling class for too long. Suddenly there'll be a conflict, a neurosis that won't permit her existence. What are you doing over there, you fucking idiots! Shithead prole! How much do Yankees pay you, you shithead scumbag?! Shithead! Traitor! Prole! You son of a bitch! They pay you in dollars, you scumbag! Scumbag! Shithead prole! What class do you belong to? Shithead! Sold out! They pay you in dollars! My family is Allendist. My stepfather isn't, Pepe is nothing, but he's also an Allendist. Mirta is Alessandrist, Mrs. Anita is Alessandrist. My godmother is Alessandrist. The other lady is also Allendist. I'm a little bit Alessandrist, in the other district they aren't. You're fighting for the Yankees. Shit! Life is that which we have, which is the only thing. We know we are wretched, because we're alive. - Allende - Allende. - Allende - Allende. Allende Are you sure they are all Allendists? Not all of them, there are exceptions. For example, my godmother is Alessandrist. My Mom is Allendist, just like my stepfather. At your place? At my place they're all Alessandrists. Do you know there was a diner at Alessandri's place the other day? Well, what should I do? I didn't accept to go. You know there are some dudes, I don't know what they're doing. So, as I was telling you it's shit because Alessandri asks Christian for his opinion. And then he started crying and stuff saying how could people lose respect for him. And Alessandri kicked him out. And who do you like? You know, I'm indecisive. I don't know who to vote for. I mean, one has to consider that all politicians are rotten. Hey, you know what, those dudes out there want something, I'm afraid. They've been there for a while. And they just want to take care of their interests, basically. They worry about others but they don't even know who they really are. You understand? Hey, those dudes are still there. I'd better leave, don't you think? - I don't know, whatever you want. - Something could happen to us, so... They've been here for some time. I don't know what they want. Godmother! Where were you? Where were you? When was it that... Wash the clothes... clean the bathroom... pay for the light... Take out garbage... make the beds... sort things out... talk a little... do the shopping... clean the future... turn on the oven... go to market... sell the bottles... soak the beans... polish reason Where were you? Where were you? Tell me where you were Where were you yesterday? When was it that... Darn the socks... stuff the birds... buy the wool... collect the cups... sell old clothes... clean the kitchen... Pass the floor cloth... talk of your life... hang out the clothes... buy the gas... cook the lentils... sell the sky... make the curtains... repair your days Where were you? Where were you? Don't worry you're at my house. - Shouldn't we study? - Yes. History. - I'm not going to tomorrow's act. - Why not? I feel so bad, anything I eat makes me feel bad. - So aren't you being careful? - Was it something you ate here? Not at all. The other day I went with Juan Carlos, I ate some ice cream and felt awful. Ah yeah, with Juan Carlos. Yes, with Juan Carlos. Are you drawing? Studying? - He's my brother. - Hi. Listen, tell your boyfriend to be more considerate, he broke the taxi's window. I had a fight with my dad, some kicks and stuff. - Hey, who won? - I don't know really, but... - Don't you want to go along? No, thank you. Listen, I don't understand that task. - Are you staying? - No they live nearby. Well, only God knows. That history task is really tough. I told you it's better if we study together. - Why don't you stay for a while? - No, I'm going. - Bye. - Bye. Mother! - You know what he told you. - I know, I'm crazy. Hold on! Are you serious about him? Of course! Why not? You know how I am. You want to continue seeing him? I want to see him! What's the problem? And where am I sleeping? - Because I can't sleep in the other bed. - Don't worry. - You can sleep with me in my dad's bed. - OK. I'll go to the bathroom. Spare me a minute. We have an older sister that was dating three guys at the same time. And one day she went out. And then one of them started to get her into prostitution. After the earthquake she brought four kids over here, after the catastrophe and stuff, the entire neighbourhood knows about it. The cops also got involved. So we want you to help her, we want you to tell her which is the right path. It just can't continue like this. Please give it a try. Just give her advice. The girl who wrote it was completely in love with XX. - That's Juan Carlos. - Yes. My friend Telma told me she considered that XX and the circumstances of our worlds were different. And in that sense his parents were going to oppose it, which was very possible. - I told you. - What does it matter? Things in XX house. Several yards, big and small. Several rooms on the first and second floor. Antique paintings, libraries, some in the bedrooms. The servant's place is bigger than my house. Cars, a big fence, beautiful carpets and sofas. There are many other beautiful things like lamps and cute dresses. Cute bath objects in English. Shut up for a while, please! Why are you telling us to shut up? Shut up! - You're pissing me off. - Shut up! Why should I shut up? Catholic University! Together we fight for honour! And carrying in our souls... Shut up! For the nation, God And the university! - Good night. - Good night. Shall I tell you a joke? Two little newborn girls, one of them ask the other: "Hey, do you think we're virgins?" "Why?", the other girl asks. "We're newborns!", she says. "No, I just sat on the dummy!", she says. Hey... that kid your aunt has... - Don't you like it? - I don't care. Look, some day you'll have to come over. And you have to look her deeply into the eyes, understand? And you'll get a good idea. No, it doesn't matter. Don't you want to? Carlos, my love I'm expecting a child. My love. I'm so happy. Should we name him Carlos? I live in a very decent place with my godmother. You know I have sisters, too? In a very decent house, with a respected family. A stewardess, a nurse. Which airline does she work for? Avianca, I think. Sometimes I suffer a lot. One day my mom's house got set on fire. She was drunk. - Did anything happen? - No, luckily. Did you know about that? Yes, yes I did. It's amazing how my mom dresses. And then she just drops her children. Where should I deliver it? And also a doggy, a very cute doggy, playing with my brother in the mud. Do you have a dog? The first fight I saw was between one from Valdivia with one from Providence. There some dudes were fighting. Another one in the Costanera, a shooting. Of course I didn't see that one, someone told me. Another one in Plaza Italia, they were some athletes who were training and fought some guys who wanted to hit us. It was in front of the CCU. And there were some nuns who wanted to fight us. In front of the US embassy there's always fighting, but not too hard. Hi. Do you remember me? Hey, so you're Ricardo. - Well, here we are. - What do you think? - You study at the French Alliance? - Yes, just like Alejandro. Ah, yes. That one! As well as his siblings. They're so miserable. - No, but it's all good. - How can it be? They come and hit defenseless people. This is a public park. People shouldn't be smoking weed and stuff. - But they can do whatever they want! - Hey, but... - How did you organize all this stuff? - We've thought about this for a while. Watch out! Look, some came from over there Others from there, more came from over there. It's amazing, no one will escape. - I'll tell you something: piss off, run. - Maybe you can piss off. No, you piss off because no one will escape us, so piss off. I was invited, but I didn't want to go. It isn't right to go out with men. Who knows where they come from, who knows where they're going. I thought it wasn't right, Maybe I sound like a decent girl. To me, the streets lead to ruin. We are the legion of fighters at the dawning of a new age, forging the glory which as of tomorrow the agile nation may use as a cover. Go ahead! Come in! Excuse me. Sit down over there! Let's listen to some modern jazz, if you're all right with it. Do you want a drink? Do you want to? No, not for me. This jazz is very lively. Now comes the "clarinet" Clarinet and improvisation, as it's called. More to drink? I'm coming. I'll soon be there with you. I don't think that it's right for us being here. What's the matter. No, let's stay here. I have to go to school! - I want to go. - Let them know! What's going on? No, we just said we wanted to go. Ready for the best? Don't touch me. Let it be. Listen, what are you doing? What are you laughing about? These things are not right. You know that. But look! Afterall you knew what was coming. No, we didn't expect that. This can be handled. Let's talk about it. Listen, girls! Listen, let me propose something! Let's do this! We just have a talk. Wait, let me talk to them. What do you think if we talk? - Girls! - That's not fine. - We'll talk about some nice things. - That's it. It's not possible for you to just leave. Let's talk calmly. Why are we even here? Do you think this is immoral? Is this a really a matter of morality or immorality? What else should it be about? It's about being well, comfortable. But we're not comfortable. You told us we came here to listen to music. Of course. We never imagined something like this. On the beach you also see people without clothes. No, but you're wearing underwear. Well, underwear is just the same as a bathing suit! - No it's different, it's underwear. - But look! I can give you some bathing suits. Then we're all the same. Well, you girls put on bathing suits and we're all equal, more or less. We'll be in the same situation. - What's the matter? - Nothing happened. What happened with the girls? It turns out they agreed to put on the bathing suits. - You see! - Look! Wait for a second! I will explain it to you. There are bathing suits for two of them. - Well, should I open the door? - Go ahead. Well, right now? What do you want? Hey, listen! We're four and four. Or rather four and five. Four and five! That's even better. You can count me in. What's the problem? Oh no, no, no. One can't continue like that for a lifetime. - Ladies! - Listen! Are they there? Have you been to a strip bar, man? It's your house. An international show. An international Lolita that came from Japan. 16 years old. It was all erotic. With lots of nice music. And she moved like that. But it was hot. And then she did this. She moved close to some old man. He resisted. - Here! - What? What a woman! A kiss. Like that. And then she grabbed a chair. Grabbed a chair. With lots of delicacy. And then a towel. And here she had a dragon, a coloured dragon. Here. She put the towel behind her legs like this. She moved it. And she started. Do you see? Look here, little brother. What do you say, little one? And she moved the towel like that. And it seemed like that old man touched her. That guy seemed to be quite an asshole. And a Brazilian girl came. But from the other side. Listen, I will have a look to see if I like them. No, no, no. I will have a look. What are you saying? Hello. - You see. - Hello. Excuse me. Come on. Another song. A sweet night. A sweet night. A sweet night. A sweet night. Come on. Go ahead. This guy is a real pain, man! It's what I'm saying, pal. What are you doing, man? I'm going over there. Go ahead! What about your wife? I'm kind of tired of her. What's the matter? He passed out. They're really getting crazy over there. You should come over. Come on, get out of here! Come on, beauty. Get out of here! Let's go! - We haven't done anything. - You haven't done anything? Bring him over there! Slowly, colleague. Take his shoes off! He was in a good mood. Ok, let's see. Don't worry. I'll take care of him. Are you leaving? Calm down! Hey, I won't allow that. No, stop it. We're getting out of here. It's time to leave. Goodbye! We'll meet again. That wretch is leaving. What? Look, what are we doing now? Napkins... More napkins... Nails! What are they doing in there? - And that one! - Bills! These things aren't worth much. More bills! They invited me to a party and I went. But damn it! How was I supposed to know it would be a real orgy. Just when the girls started to put on old-fashioned dresses, they gave one to me, then they got naked. I didn't want to do that. And then they did striptease and stuff. They took their clothes off in a degenerate way. Then I saw them on top of each other, who knows what were they doing. But it seems all right, doesn't it? - More or less. - The treatment is fine. First of all, when it comes to the house, it's not me who takes care of it. It's my wife who takes care of it. That's what needs to be said. Yes, that's what needs to be said. She deserves credit for it. - Who else needs some ice? - No, I'm OK, thanks. All right, cheers! Let's see, how are things going? I request to continue with the preparations. Excuse me, I reflected on it. With the customs and such. What about the doll? The doll is here. I actually saw some good ones over there. It looks like the businesses are... Hey, you know, a very strange thing happened. RaÃºl was there at the office. And someone had told him that the person that's always walking behind me were my bodyguard. It's not the case, though it turns out that they confused him with a bodyguard. They actually told me the same. It could well be the case, right? That's how you get respected. There's one thing I wanted to ask you. I've been thinking about it since the beginning. Wednesday or Thursday, when we were at your office, there was a man with grey hair, a tall one. - Ah, that's Fernando Sotomayor. - Exactly. Which Sotomayor is he? He's Eduardo's brother. - Yes, he's his brother. - No, it's another one. No no, you're mistaken, he's Eduardo's brother. I see. It's the older brother. They have a house in the development area. Aren't they the ones that have been commissioned? I know them, but those are others. - He's a consultant and also assessor. - No, you're right Patricio. - But do you remember? They were talking about some Sotomayor. - Exactly. - Exactly, yes. Yes, that him. Of course. - But are you interested in continuing? - Yeah, of course. Afterall, we're here to celebrate business. Yes. And the bed... Everyone's got their ideas, so... I think that... I don't really agree. No, let him talk if he wants to. The thing is that you give too much importance to material things and above all the business and stuff. But in the end there are many more positive things than that! Like for example? Like for example, there are more delicate matters. Let Patricio talk! Thanks, I'm not thirsty. Try to think for yourself, meditate on what's inside you. Hey Carlos, you can think about yourself while we do more than just thinking, Yeah, you can stay there with your tie. I'll stay here with my tie making money all night so you can think in peace. Everyone has their own lives and we should respect that. That's correct. I have my own ideas and you have to respect it. This class of philosophy... We have nothing to tell him. Carlos criticizes, but meanwhile we make the money to provide the possibility. No, but that not it. You only want to feel important, wearing your tie, being all rich and stuff. But in the end it's not that what matters. No, you guys don't understand. I'll explain it. You see, what Carlitos is saying is that money is being brought by the night fairies. No, that's not it either, you're not getting it! That's not it! No, I've had enough of it. Look, I'm going to tell you something, don't take it badly. He's a good kid, but it's just that he... At any moment he'll appear at the door. - Everything fine? - Yes, it's all fine. - Is Patricio in there? - Yeah, he is. Take an aspirin and go to sleep. - Good night. - Good night. - Hi. - Hi. You know my parents came with some friends. And they are drinking and celebrating I don't know what. And I took the opportunity to bring you the batteries. Hey, whom do you prefer? Christian or myself? I like you all, all of you, your mom, your dad. But he's way more popular. He's more casual and he's also shorter. - He brings gifts. - What dolls has he given you? Paz and Macarena. Listen, and where's the other doll they gave you? I gave it to Vicky. - Hey, you still have the pics of my folks? - No, I didn't put them there. - But they're dumb, why do they put up that stuff? - Magallanes vs Colo-Colo.. Magallanes won 3- 2, one player sent off in the second half. How about in 1938? That time, Colo-Colo vs. Magallanes, Colo-Colo won that one 3 - 1. - It rained the whole game. - And who told you...? I was thinking that we've known each other for quite some time. We should have a relationship. A lasting one, you know. Whenever you want. - Do you mean a love relation? - Something like that, but thinking about the future. Well, let me tell you something. I don't really love you. Only as a friend. I don't want to hurt you, but I know that you'll find a better girl. Nevermind. Did I tell you the joke I recently read in the newspaper? Well, there's a circus that calls itself "THE HUMAN EAGLES". They shout: "Listen, here's the the great circus for all the children of Chile. Listen, the circus "THE HUMAN EAGLES" is suitable for all children. Listen, the great circus! To all children, come to the circus!" And then someone gets out of the truck. He opens his wallet and says: "Fly in here, eagle!" According to the date, 1920. Santiago National vs. Iberia, Iberia won 2 - 1. Ten and... Third date in 1950. That's a famous date. Colo-Colo won 4 - 1. The first goal was scored by Jorge Robledo. It was a great goal after 15 minutes. - Won't you look at that! - What, it's the truth! I've got a good memory. Anything I see, I memorize it! Without any problem. Your neurons fail, mine don't. Where's the money I hid here? - Stop it. - Anything I see. There's nothing in here. Stop it, old woman. - Where's the money I hid here? - What do I know? It looks like there's a thief in my house. They took my money from here. - Don't make me laugh though. - The money was in here. Stop it, old woman. They steal from me and also make fun of me! Enough already. Do you miss your father a lot? No, only sometimes. I don't miss anyone. Sometimes I miss him. When I go to places where he went. When I go to the corner of the stairs and see the mice living there... Before they were near the beach. He used to live with us. Or when I go to the room, because he slept in the room where I sleep now, I slept in the other room with my kid brother. So sometimes I go to the other room thinking it's my room. Or I just imagine my dad is sleeping beside me when I'm in my room. Also when I stumble in the living room I remember him, because he also stumbled in there. And it makes me sick. I don't know, I want to puke given the impression. Also the magazine in the bathroom. From the times when my dad was alive. - But that'll just make you laugh. - No, I don't laugh about that stuff. You know, I really respect all people. Above all, I respect you, because It's not right you've been through all that. - I try not to... - That's what I'm saying. I try not to read the magazine, but sometimes I can't help it and I realize that a lot of people have written rude stuff in it and it pisses me off. As I said, I would never laugh about this stuff you're telling me, you know? I have enough reasons, but really I respect everyone. - Are you going to cry? - No, I'm fine, it's okay. - Why am I like this, Juan Carlos? - Like what? So cold. Because that's how they taught us to be. That's how everyone has been all their lives, so nothing can change. As far as I understand. It's natural. - You know I'm telling you the truth. - It's not possible. This love between you is monstrous. - Because that man is your son. - Shut up! He'll know it all. What have I told you? Why are you persecuting me like this? It's my fate. Until the next time, Maria Isabel... Here comes your son! My love. Yeah, I like it simple. Antonio, he was my husband, he liked it strong, but I could never get used to it. It's a family matter. You don't like me talking about my husband, right? - Why not? He was a good man. - Of course. He was a good man. Grab me. - Like this? - No, the other way! What do you feel? Go away, madam. - Don't you want me to see you dancing? - Just go away. - I'll go upstairs. - Wherever you want, just disappear! You want me to go on the street, but I'm going upstairs. If you touch me, I'll tell my mother, as I did on the first communion. - I'll just be quiet. - Shut up already! - I won't shut up. - Shut up! This is the famous feminine gender, these are women! Get in the kitchen, shit! Do something more useful. Double widow. - Parallel widows. - Simply widows. Widow and miracle of Saint Bernardette. - Widow, passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. - All the retired widows. Our widows are the rivers that go to the sea. - To win the widow. - A new widow. - Remaking his widow. - The hot widow. - To win the widow. - Having seven widows with objects. - Parallel widows. You know, I'm missing some of these. These aren't all of them. - You took one of these. - You're crazy, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - I didn't. These are my brother's, he'll check. You can't imagine how tired I am. - Listen, little sister! - Yes? You were talking with Juan Carlos the other day, right? What did you talk about? - We couldn't say much. - Yes, you talked a lot. - No, you quickly slipped in... - Wait a little. when you arrived. And... It's ready. No, we really couldn't talk at all. You see? Maybe they only talked about dirty stuff. Sexy stuff, sexy stuff! Yes or no? An intimate widow. - A large widow. - An endowed widow. - The endowed widow of the bourgeois. - The endowed widow of the marquis. A widow in the depths of the sea. The extraterrestrial widow. Below the sea level? Yes. What are they talking about? It's pretty messed-up. - What? We're messed-up? - No. Not that much. Do you want to go to the book fair or don't you? - It depends. - Come on, don't be stupid. Hey Mirta, I want you to tell me once and for all: what did Juan Carlos tell you? It happened. It happened. We met there in the house and then you came in. He asked me if you went to school. Put them like this. You need to have it like that. He asked me if I've seen you at school, that's all. It happened. I'm leaving... - Well see you... Bye. - Bye. Hey Telma, what is life for you? Life... is a passion, a great love. Having a man who loves me and gives me lots of kids. Well, not many. A few. One who is patient. - Who adores me... - Good evening. Good evening. Look, I was a friend of the owner, so I'm working at Mantos Blancos and since I'm going to my brother's wedding, I passed by to pay some money I owed him. So I said I'll take the chance and pass by to pay him. - And I want... Madam, good evening. - Good evening... I'm a friend of the owner, so I came by to pay him some money. Because I'm working at Mantos Blancos up north. I decided to use the opportunity to pay him, as I'm going to my brother's wedding. Good evening. Are you the friend of the deceased man? I married his woman. The woman of the deceased man. Good evening. I'm working countless hours. And what are you doing still up? And he fell down like that. One wrong step at the edge and he flew through the air. And I just stared. I couldn't understand that my father was dead. Go figure. And he was taken to the apartment where I supposedly lived with my mom. And we cried and looked at each other. I had been watching television. And I suddenly realized that my father was dead. Did nobody vote? Why? I don't get involved in politics. Exactly. - Be comfortable with what you have. - Don't get involved in politics. The same goes for that old man. It's not that I don't care about politics. I actually like it. I am who I am. You don't like it, hard luck. If life changes, it's welcome. Do you know the lyrics of "We Shall Prevail"? I know it by heart. I also know "Sunshine", "Facing the Sun", "Erica". Listen, I have written it down. Why don't you recite it for us? The popular clamour rises from the deep crucible of the nation. Once the dawn breaks, all Chile begins to sing. In remembrance of the courageous soldier whose example has made him immortal We first confront death. We never betray the nation. We shall prevail, we shall prevail! A thousand chains we'll have to break. We shall prevail, we shall prevail! The Popular Unity will win. Peasants, soldiers, miners, as well as the nation's women, students, employees and workers. We will do our duty. We'll sow the land with glory. Socialism will be our future. All together, we will complete history. - We shall prevail, we shall prevail. - Well done. - You're trendy. - No he's an Allendist. - I'm a leftist. - You're an Allendist, man. He's on the left, for sure. What do you mean? How is the girl behaving? Well, now she has a boyfriend. Ah, so she has a boyfriend now? Hey, daughter. What is that supposed to mean? I won't take this! Come on! Calm down! Where are you going girl, where? Where are you going, girl? Leave her alone! She behaves like that at night. - You have to accept it. - It cannot be, it cannot be. You have to resign yourself. - You must be strong. - You don't understand. What did I do to deserve this? There are beings who are born under the sign of disgrace. Now you know that your love... is impossible. I always knew it. You're... beloved by everyone, doctor. You know what I mean. I don't understand you, doctor. The only woman I've loved in my life... are you. Fernando... Leave me alone. Farewell, Maria Isabel. A Miguelito, a little boy that was left without a mother when he was very young. And at his father's, who was a miner, in a little ranch next to a mountain, he was raised. When his father came home from the mine, he enjoyed singing this song: Daddy! Daddy! Let me sing, so that you can rest from the tiresome work. Daddy! Take me to the mine, so that I can help you with your labour. Like destiny that doesn't forgive, his father was also taken by God. And since then, when the miners return, you can hear Miguelito sing the song: Daddy! Daddy! Let me sing. I forgot the lyrics. I can't keep singing. This is the kind of song that gets me very emotional, really. Why don't they play more of this on the radio, instead of that other stuff? On the radio they play angry, violent stuff. But that's the music I like. Not these ones, like this one. Today on the beach I saw her. I looked at her and followed her. And she looked at me. And within a moment she disappeared. And within a moment she disappeared. - Thank you. - Good night. - Go out. - Thank you, you're very kind. - Good night. - Good night. Ah, thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Of course we were good friends, we worked on several buildings together! And he came one day and I told him I wanted to go to work up north. And he told me: "Go there!" He even lent me some money, so I could manage the first few days. And from there I went further North and it went well. Now I've returned to pay back the money. But I was actually a great friend of his. Nowadays I don't see him that much, except for tonight. That's why we're going to stay here for a while. - Tomorrow I'll travel again. - So I'm sorry. What? What? - Good night. - Good night. Today on the beach I saw her. I looked at her and followed her. And she looked at me. And within a moment she disappeared. Good night. And within a moment she disappeared. Every Wednesday and Friday afternoon I used to visit Juan Carlos' place, and the maid always greeted me. Now she never says hello. Sometimes I pass by and she doesn't even look. Disgrace Each day more disgrace Of this love, this crazy love That's what the others always feel But while we love each other there will be no anguish We will look at each other and even get used to the incomprehension Nobody will ever know. Good evening. - Are you from this neighbourhood? - Yes. - Do you live here? - Sure. - You were in Carlos' circle of friends? - Sure, I used to hang out with him. - Haven't you seen him lately? - No, not for a week. - I don't know what's happened to him. - You don't know where he might be? No, if you want I can help you find him, but it's really hard. - I believe it. - May I? - Of course. - Excuse me. - Good night, madam. - Good night. - Want to come in for a coffee? - No thanks, no. - Good night. - Good night. I know that life is promising. There is something that tells me that. I like you because you're ambitious. So, I should look for you? Goodbye, my love. Goodbye. Come on, Maria. I don't want to. I don't know why you're asking me. - I've told you everything my whole life. - Just stop it. If something had happened, I would have told you. - But don't you like him? Tell me. - What do you want me to tell you? Seriously, don't you want to sleep with him when you're both together? I don't want to talk about it. - Bye. - Bye. It has been about fifteen days since I last saw Juan Carlos. He came to my house several times, but I wasn't there, I was at school. Once he came to my school, but I didn't see him and they told me about it later. And I passed by his house several times, but never had the nerve to ask for him. Once I phoned him, but another person answered so I hung up. So many times he has looked for me, but why hasn't he found me at least once? Which is your glass? The left or right one? The left one, I think. Hey, what's wrong? You look so tense. Nothing's wrong. This is not an otherworldly thing, you've got to relax. I know... - I know. - Really? - Really. - Then relax. Give me a kiss! Do you feel I belong here? Yes, you're family. You seem far away. - Have you been with someone else? . That's not true. - Do you want a drink? - No, you drink. Wait. - Do you know that... - What? You know what I don't like? Hanging around these parts. - Why? I think it's nice. - You're crazy, how can it be nice? I don't get how people can come to these places. I don't know, you see. There should be free love or something like that. - Why then do you bring me here? - What do I know... Well, are you still being tense? - Relax, you like it after all. - But I am relaxed. What's happening then? You know, Juan Carlos, you're the one with the problem Are you mad at me? You're always so likeable, aren't you? Imbecile! Damn, but how do you know I have a problem? Because I do. What do you mean by "because I do"? You are the problem! How many guys have you slept with? Imbecile! I thought you loved me, Juan Carlos. You don't love me... No one ever got me that illusioned. I've told my friends, my neighbours... My mom, my godmother. My mom challenged me and I stuck up for you. And you just laugh at me. I do love you, you don't love me... Kill me, Juan Carlos. - Don't say such stupid things. - Kill me, kill me, kill me. I don't want to live like this. Kill me... What's my family going to say about me? A stewardess... They won't understand it. Noone will understand. All have known about it. What a shameful thing... Kill me, Juan Carlos, kill me. Kill me. Kill me. I want to die. What the fuck, you went too far. Now you'll stain the sheets and everything! Got to pay for the sheets and all that. The only thing you care about! The only thing I care about... - Do you have a cloth? - In my purse. - What are you looking for? - The bathroom. Have you seen Shame? - No what's that? - A TV series. You know, I'd like to work on a TV series. Really? - Let's see your hand. - No. - Let me see your hand! - No, no, no. It's to make a tourniquet. we used to do that when we went camping. Don't be so dumb! Let me see your hand! - You seem like a little girl. - Let go of me. I've discovered the truth. He is not your son. It was all an imagination. It's full of dirt, my god! - Let me do it. - No, I'll do it. When we do a general cleaning, you you throw out everything that's useless. Yes, godmother. - They can't marry? - No, because he's her son. He's got no idea, he met her in a cabaret and she sings so nicely. What this young man needs is someone to take care of him and love him. I'm so angry! Two episodes on and they've kissed already. Oh no, I can't believe it Many things happen here in Chile. - Shall I keep this? - No! Not that. What should I do with it? With the quakes all the jam jars have shaken. Put those over there by the handleless cups. The bottles are also in the kitchen. Be careful with the bottles. Make sure that there will be no spilling. No, I don't want to. Please leave me alone. It's all right. See you! I'll be back later tonight. - You can throw this and this, too. - This will be useful. And this is useful, too. Did you see the new clothes? They were bought on Friday, I think. They actually bought me these clothes. You know who put a detective on the novelist to follow him. The detective falls in love with Maria Isabel. He's possibly a gringo. No it's not the gringo, that man isn't ugly. He's blond, but that's it. Leave those things alone, godmother! I have to take care of everything, daughter. I don't think so. I don't think so. Leave that be, you idiot. I don't want that. - Is Maria in? - Yes. Just a moment. Maria! Godmother, I'm going out. I'll be back later. - Not the cups, shit! Not the cups. - Godmother! Not the cups, shit! Careful, careful. Not the cups! Whore! Whore, whore! Hi, I came to tell you we're not going out tonight. - No? - No, because my brother arrived. We want to spend time with mother. But I'll call you another day! If you aren't here it doesn't matter. Okay. Bye. It's all over now. A kiss! It's just that crochet makes me so nervous! It's really nice. But it's a pity that it's so difficult. It's nice. Believe me! It's quite simple! The last time I saw Juan Carlos was on Saturday, I had a problem with my godmother. I remember we agreed to meet, but then he came to tell me we wouldn't go out. That was the last time I saw him. The information has just arrived at our news department. In the province BiobÃ­o, municipality of Quilaco, we've counted up till now 859 votes. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Haven't you seen him? - Later, he'll arrive later.

Alright, let's celebrate then. And you Carlitos, past erased, new account heh? Good... I think that we should celebrate, am I right? It's good that this isn't forgotten. - You never forget these things. - No. But before, I'd like to present my sons. - That's what we agreed on. - Ah. Very well, then. - Santiago and Julio. - My pleasure. - You're welcome. They'll be Carlitos' mates and they'll help him, too. Everything has been explained. OK, now let's go upstairs. Honestly, I think that we should celebrate this. That's what brings us here, so let's take our glasses and... let's say what we should say on these occasions. Above all I think we should celebrate, as Gabriel would say. He's nothing more than my right-hand man. Pals! So on these occasions, since so many years have passed, almost always the same things are being said. But to me this occasion has a very special flavour. We're living through tough times and Gabriel has been domineering at all times. That's valuable to me. A really substantial value. - We can again expect chaos. Right? - Well, yes. - Here's the city. - Yes. Let's put in one coin. Here you've got custody of marine infants. - I'm understand. That's Chile. - Raising again. About 100,000 proletarians arrived. More than that. - Let's say 700,000. - Yes, that's more accurate. But these guys in here fool themselves. Yes, under these circumstances. Let's meet one of these days, right here if you like. Bye. Put the suitcase there! Hey, so I went to my sister's wedding and I heard that a cousin had died. She and her husband has been separated. - Good evening! - How are you? What's new? Good evening. How are you? I told them about a cousin. Ah, I see. - Maria hasn't arrived? - Not yet. A cousin of mine just died! I'm going to search for something I have here.. - What happened to the kid that sang? - He stayed over there, you know? He liked the trees, all the green stuff and he stayed. The rivers and all that. Those are the things that matter to him. Hello, friend. Don't you remember? Hello, friend. Don't you remember me? Ah, hello, how are you? Bye! Thus the matter is as follows. But what are you talking about? - The warning about the coup in Chile. - What coup are you talking about? The coup I'm telling you about. How are we going to maintain the order? How are we gonna maintain our triumph? Ah lady, many thanks, because I have some friends in the South and they invited me to sleep at their place, on the occasion of my sister's wedding. May I use the bathroom? The baby needs to pee. Yeah, well, whenever you want we'll have a talk. Remember, I'll be next. Should we go? The talk was great, but... You're always telling the same things. Well, there's no problem. - Hey, when do we meet again? - Tomorrow at 6 o'clock. See you. I'll be there at 6 or at half past 6. Bye. If I shouldn't be there, you can find me at the lounge. - Did you see the newspapers? The newspapers, did you see them? - No. There's a picture of the dude that came over here everyday. He's involved in this mess. Yeah, there's his picture. Hey lady, please forgive me but it's getting too late so... Look, I don't need to get involved with these things. But behind the door there's a young lady that looks sick. Are we going to enter? Damn it, man. Sweetie... Sweetie... Maria! Maria! Answer me, sweetie! Aren't you feeling cold with that clothes on? Let's carry her! She hit me. You're a despicable woman. Why are you like that? Perhaps I like it. Now during Sundays I go to Juan Carlos's house to watch TV. There's a girl that invites me. Sometimes to the kitchen or the subway. Juan Carlos moved to Spain, it's better that he left. My dear, I explained to you the exchange needs to be sooner rather than later. The tickets, we would also need those. If we worry about such things, we'll resolve nothing. I've explained to you that even though RaÃºl's house is a little smaller than ours, it fits perfectly! So, it's something we've got to resolve today, my dear. Yes, I agree, but also think of the gardener, we also have to resolve that. Listen, we can't solve all this right now. Yes, but the kids, they'll have to change when going to college. You're right. Look, the first thing is the house. I explained that, as RaÃºl has said, the distance is very great. Even if the house were bigger, I wouldn't know if it were the right thing! Yes, I agree that we must change houses, but remember I'll have to buy things and to have the children exchange schools. Altogether there are too many things. Let's leave that and discuss the tickets you mentioned. The tickets depend on the signature that can come out on the 18th or 19th, understand? - But it's not the same, 18th or 19th. - Of course it's not the same! No, because it depends on the signature, so I should solve that as well, but... Let's leave that for later. On the other hand, to me thing with the gardener is also very important. - The gardener issue is solved. - But... Yes, it's already solved. The ticket and all that. We can't go together. - I have to go and drive him. - Perfect, perfect. I met Juan Carlos at a festival in Piedra Roja. When I met him I found him to be so nice. So tall and slim, such a cute face. I liked him so much. But I don't think he liked me as much. As I told you, Maria Isabel remained lonely day and night and she was forced to go and work. She started to sing. She was a good singer and had a great triumph. And then she left the country. She visited the whole continent of South America. She did amazingly well! Over there she met a producer who turned her into an actress. - She had a great status. - Really? Sure. She returned to her country in triumph, happy and full of glory. And here she met a novelist who became interested in her life. She hadn't known him before and she told him her origins, since she was a peasant. So the novelist suggested to her to film a soap opera of her life. - A soap opera? - Yeah, so then she had to start back in the times of being a peasant and servant. And after that he came with his car towards the house. We came in, ate, he changed clothes. And we went to the beach, a place I didn't know, so solitary. Not even a soul. Then he told me to undress, I was ashamed because I had torn clothes. And he had such nice clothes, so soft. But when I undressed I realized that he wasn't looking at me, can you imagine? He wasn't looking at me. And he was so beautiful, so gentle. - It was something pure, you understand? - Yes. And we went for a swim together, naked both of us. Then we returned. - Then we went to the car and left. - Yes. We arrived at his house, he changed his clothes. He said he would take me. I had assumed to go alone. But those were strange things about him. And after a while I liked them. I began to liked them more. - I don't know, it's something so nice. - Maria. - Sit down. - Thank you. Listen, I talked to my associate and she agrees, so I think you can start working very soon. - Do you think I can be useful to her? - Yes, certainly. How are you, my little girl? - How are you? - Fine, my little daughter. Thanks. - Everything's fine. And how are you? - Fine. - Have you been feeling well? - Yes. Because I don't even know what time it is. The reason is that her nerves are strained. I'm stressed out, they're annoying me because they won't leave me alone. Yes, but I'm doing well. I'm doing well. Tomorrow I will take you out a little when they hold communion. You can drink a juice, take a walk in the park, and relax. No. All priests are faggots. She has communion by force. Next week I'll move to Argentina. I don't want to be here when the communists come. The radio soap opera will continue in June. Yes, it's a good one. They got married just because their parents didn't want them to. They got married and then they left. Pay attention to the rhyme. Here it says: Don't cry, my little daughter. Don't cry. It's alright. Hand me my wallet. Don't listen to her. Why is she crying? Take this. I have to leave. Are you sure you'll be all right? I'm leaving. Goodbye. - And how is Enrique? - More or less well. What's the matter? - Fine. - You know what? I found a victory rhyme. I told him: The soccer club Colo-Colo should have a victory building. And then he said: Hand me the carrot. - Did you like it? - Yes, a lot. Tomorrow, Maria, you have to arrive at 10 o'clock. You have to open the store, put everything in order, clean. The servants surely took care of it. But you have to look after everything. I always arrive around 11, that's when the public arrive. In any case a customer may come in before that time. How would you attend to them? What would you show them? I'd like to know how you'd react. It depends on their age. - It depends on what they ask too. - On what they ask, their size. Yes. What size would a person with my body for example have? 44... - or 46. - 42 or 44, yes more or less. And the colors, what colors would you give a person my age, for example. Opaque colours. And for a boy? Coffee colours, more or less. Orange as well. Grey. The combination of these colours. Right? Show me your hands. You must take care of them. Go have a manicure. You must always be very fashionable, for example that blouse doesn't go with those pants. But I'll teach you with time. Now let me show you the sizes. This shop is so disorganized. Here they start. These are large sizes, all of these sizes are for tall people. - I start with these? - Yes, they bring more clothes on Monday. But in general they are here, all the large sizes. Here are the medium sizes for medium sized people, 40, 42. And here are the smaller sizes. All of these, the dresses too, more Lolita-like. Now I have to go. Don Fernando waits for me at home. He'll tell me that my only child has died. I'm so unfortunate. Help me, Virgin. Make Juan Carlos fall in love with another. A foreign woman who doesn't love him, but another man. Make this other man fall in love with me and make me not love him, because I love Juan Carlos with all my heart. Make that woman leave Juan Carlos for the other man. Make that man leave that woman for me. Make me reject that man. Have Juan Carlos know everything and realize the only one who loves him, is me. That I am the only one, Virgin Mary. By our Lord Jesus Christ, may it be so. Just like the wind that's kissing the waves in the sea, your eyes enter my heart. To be continued... Disgrace Each day more disgrace Of this love, this crazy love That's what the others always feel But whilst we love each other, there will be no anguish We can look at each other and even conform to incomprehension They will never know that destiny We would like to thank the residents of Chiloe... and countless others whose names have not been preserved. The world has turned us into a vile mirror
