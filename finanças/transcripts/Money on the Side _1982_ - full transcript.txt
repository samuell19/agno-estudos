All I ever wanted, I thought, was a home, a husband and children. Lots of children... to love and nourish. Then, when... when our baby was born, with his special problems, we needed to find new definitions for dreams. Even for love. Both Nels and I went crazy the first year with the baby. I guess Nels tried to just dismiss reality by pure force of will, but couldn't. So I guess I did what I did for more reasons than one. I said it was for Scottie, and it was. But life is complicated, and you just... you do what you have to do. I was 17 when I got married. Well, I lost that baby, but... Jack said we would go ahead and stay married. He didn't have anything else, and he was tired of living at home with his parents. We were really poor. We didn't have any money. Jack pumped gas, and I waited tables, and then... there was CeeCee. And that was kind of good. I... It was kind of bad, too. Jack was never home. He was always out at the gym... He told me once that I had ruined his plans. I... I got married very young. Um, it lasted for five years. Chip was... He's charming, and then he's wonderful. And he's completely selfish. He, um... He had no idea what marriage was all about, and I guess I didn't either. I'll admit it, but it was destined to fail, and it failed. It just... It just seems that every promise we made to each other and to ourselves we broke. We were great in public. We were so good in public, but you get us home... So I was left with nothing, except bad debts. I mean, face it, a woman's options in this society are really limited. [TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] Which one of these is the cigar lighter? Blasted newfangled gadgets. Never work. [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] You didn't wake me up. What's the alarm for? What's that? I got a kink in my back. What do you know? Mr. and Mrs. Gilson. Take a deep breath, let it out. [EXHALES, GRUNTS] [EXCLAIMS] Sweat... You... Mmm. Hey, what are you doing? Living on pizza and chocolate cake? Come on. Don't say that. Not saying is not gonna make it go away. You need discipline, Annie. How about I get a picture of you when you was a little girl, put it on the refrigerator? Help you remember what you used to look like? Oh... I gotta go shower. What for? You don't have to be at work for... [PHONE RINGING] Annie, I'm sorry... Where's my lunch? Isn't it ready yet? Oh, it's on the counter, honey. CEECEE: It is not. It's in the refrigerator. Hello. Then why did you ask? CEECEE: You didn't put it out. Oh, give us a kiss... Karen? Yeah, hi. KAREN: You coming by this morning? I have time if you want to study. Oh... Sure. KAREN: How was it last night? What? [WATER RUNNING] Oh. Yeah... It was great, great... Good. Well, he was okay. Listen, I really can't talk now. I'll... I'll see you later, okay? You seen the papers? WHITE: I don't read the papers. Housewives' prostitution rings. Feature article. Front page. Not in the Sports section? Investigative reporter paid a hundred to one of our housewives. The D.A., up for re-election, reads the article, calls the Chief. The Chief calls the Captain. The Captain, he doesn't read the article. He calls the Lieutenant who calls me and you. WHITE: Of course, none of these citizens has any idea this is going on for the past year in our files. Look at it this way. When we find out who these housewives are, maybe one will turn out to be the D.A.'s wife... Or the Chief's. Or yours. Or mine. Next? Finally. I'm sorry. It says here your benefits have run out. No, wait, I worked four months last year. Four months must mean something. I'm sorry. You'll have to step aside. Could you just please check it out? It could be the computer made an error. Those things... I really am sorry. Yeah. JAN: Well...they cut me off. What do you mean, they cut you off? Just what I said, they cut me off. Scottie! Scottie, honey, Daddy's driving. Go in the back. Be careful. Go in the back. Be careful. What do you mean, they cut you off? I don't know. I didn't make enough money to qualify for any extra benefits. I argued with the woman and... I don't understand that. I asked her. I thought it was a mess-up in the computer, you know, somewhere, but... She wouldn't budge. So that's out. How are we supposed to make the house payment? [SIGHS] Nels, something will happen. It always does, doesn't it? We'll be all right. I should have been on the road an hour ago. What do you mean? We have that appointment at Scottie's school this afternoon. I can't. I have two appointments in Stockton. JAN: You said this morning you were going to cancel those. NELS: I know, but Whitcome is going on vacation. If I miss him this morning, I won't be able... JAN: It took me two weeks to get this appointment. It's with the Principal. NELS: I'm sorry. You go. One day out of your life, Nels. I don't have any days to spare in my life. I don't have anything to spare. I got one suit, one car that needs a new engine. I have nothing to spare. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I wish I could make you understand what it feels like for me to walk into some guy's office. You're a terrific salesman. You sold me. Listen. Listen, when I get back, why don't we drop Scottie off at your sister's, take a couple of days and go for a drive, maybe up to the Russian River, go camping, fishing? We can't afford it. We've nothing to spare, remember? I'll borrow the tent, okay? Come on, just a couple of days. You and me. Alone? If you'll go to the Principal's. I got an eight-hour drive ahead of me. The car'll keep breaking down... You just don't want to. There is nothing wrong with him, Jan. I'll be back on Wednesday. We'll see about going on the Russian River then, okay? Sure, okay. MICHELLE: Okay. No, it's okay. All right. Thanks. Cathy, my dentist appointment was moved until two. Can you cover for me until about four, four-thirty? CATHY: Maybe. Is he cute? MICHELLE: It's a she. She's cute. Okay. You owe me. Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling. A homey place like this ought to have a chime in the door. Mr. Ellison's office. How can you tell that? Hi, Mr. Hendricks. Hold on. Just look at that manual dexterity. Hi, Hendricks on two. I'd like to punch your button. Okay. Hi, he'll be right with you. Okay. What are you doing here? Fifteen seconds. Jackson called back. It's been two months. Wanna borrow my car? He wants another interview. I'm this close to the job. No! Managing the department. No. International relations... London, Paris, Rome? No. This is my chance to... To wreck my car as well as my life. Forget it. Who wrecked whose life? You can't stay here. I work here. I don't want to stay here. I just want to borrow the car. Come here. Come on, come on, come on, come here. Smell this. You smell that? What's that the smell of? Huh? Nothing. Nothing. Just like a baby. Fresh as... Fresh as a daisy. Very steady, no tremor. Not a drop. Not a drop. Thank you. Oh, my fault, one hundred percent. Just needed to borrow the family car, but don't worry, because I'm going. Have a happy day. KAREN: I'm not the least bit concerned. I'm waiting to hear from them. I'll call you as soon as they call me. I promise. I'll get right back to you. Bye-bye. Hi! Hi. Did those notes help at all? I don't know. It makes me so mad. I'm really dumb. Oh! No, you're not, and don't say that. Let's start with the boring stuff first. He was...okay. Let's start with Tenancy in Common. Here's a pencil, take notes. The thing you have to understand about Tenancy in Common under the law is either party can alienate his or her shares, and you don't have to own equal shares. Saved by the bell. Hello, Santa Marta Realty. Well, hello, when did you get into town? Yes, I think I can. As a matter of fact, I have a very special person sitting right across the table from me. Brigitte. Bri-gitte. Bri-gitte. Oh, I beg your pardon. Bri-gitte. Oh, I know you'll like her. Okay? Okay. Okay, I'll send her right over. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Hi. Can I buy you another one? Why don't we skip the drink? I'll bet you a hundred dollars you want a date with me. A hundred? Yep. Well, I guess you win. [CHILDREN PLAYING] [♪♪♪] SGT. STAMPONE: Let me put it this way. This John who hurt you is looking for more hookers to beat up. TERRI: Get lost. You, my dear, are the fourth girl he's put in the hospital. He'll do it again, Terri. One day, he'll kill somebody. TERRI: Is there anything else I can do for you? Yeah. Next trick you date in a bar, get his fingerprints on your neck while he does you in. Do that for me, huh? [TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [PHONE LINE RINGING] Santa Marta Reality, Karen speaking. Hi, Karen, it's Janice. Janice Vernon. KAREN: Oh, Janice, hi. Let me put you on hold, just a moment. Oh, sure. I'm back. I'm sorry. Yes. Mm-mm, that's quite a few. It might be a problem getting ten. How much? No, I would want 200 a girl, plus what they get. Yes. I have my problems, too. Blair's moved out of town, and Roxanne is no longer in the life, shall we say? I've had to get all new girls. Let me call you back. I have a client on the other line. All right. All right, I'll be right back. Bye. Janice, I'm sorry. What can I do for you? Karen, I was wondering if we came down a few thousand, if we could... make a quick sale? Look, I've got to be perfectly honest with you. You'd have to come down at least 10,000. The market is off. The houses are just not selling. Janice? Well, you don't understand. We have to. We're desperate. We're going bankrupt. Oh, now, it can't be that bad. I mean, things are tough, but they're not going to stay that way. I can't wait for them to get better. You can't? No. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to take you for a three-martini lunch, at a very good French restaurant, with wonderful white wine and snobby waiters, and the treat's on me. You don't have to go to that trouble. It's absolutely no trouble. It's my pleasure. I've been thinking about you, honestly I have. I have something to discuss, but not on the phone. We'll do it at lunch, all right? I'll pick you up at one o'clock. All right. Now be of good cheer. There's always a solution. Thanks, Karen. Okay, bye. Hypocrisy. I always said it was total, absolute hypocrisy. This society wants women to be a Sugar Plum Fairy and Grandma Moses, at the same time she's some cutesy centerfold with everything showing. It's outrageous. Everything I ever said or did was just to enable people to live out their own needs and their own fantasies. Come on, are you going to tell me the average woman isn't involved in some kind of transaction? JANICE: That was absolutely the best meal I've ever had. I wish I could put it on tape so I could play it back later. [KAREN LAUGHS] Do you come here often? Oh, no. Only when I bring important clients like you. The commission on my house won't even pay for this meal. If you can just hang on until the market loosens up... We can't make next month's mortgage payment. If you can't sell the house this month, you might as well sell it for the bank. I'm sorry. You can't find work? Last year, I worked four months in a doughnut shop. It was all I could find. And my unemployment benefits have run out, so... I just hate the idea of you losing that house. Yeah. Maybe I can help. Then you know of some work? Your kids? Mm-hmm. Ramsey's at Indiana University in his third year. And, Kim, bless her heart, has run off to be a Moonie in Oregon. She was a Jesus freak before that. They're my kids all right. Where's your husband? Donald? When the kids left, he said the house got too silent. So, he traded in his station wagon for a Porsche and took off for Venice. I understand he roller skates up and down the beach every weekend. He also closed all of our bank accounts when he left, and took all of our savings. I was flat broke. You certainly came out of it. I survived. That's what we all do. You can meet some of the most interesting people in the real estate business. They come through here, or they're in San Jose or Stockton. They come through here temporarily. Some awfully nice guys that are... oh, a little lonely, nervous, worried, that sort of thing. But they're usually very successful. They have money, they're educated, and they're looking for a little company. What kind of company? Oh, no, thank you. What kind of company? Forget it. I just thought of something. If you can possibly carry... What kind of company, Karen? Drinks, dinner, a little conversation, companionship. Mostly companionship. Mostly. I'm sorry if I've insulted you. How much do they pay? Depends. On what? Time. What you do is your business. How much time? Oh, an hour, a weekend. Some of the girls go to Reno or Las Vegas or Los Angeles. One girl had an absolutely wonderful week in Hawaii. How many girls do you have? I don't think that's any of your business. [LAUGHS] Is there something about me that made you pick me for a candidate? [LAUGHS] I like you. And you're in need. Yeah, I'm not outraged. As a matter of fact, I'm a little flattered. But I can't do it. I just can't. Can't. Well, I'm not outraged either. I'm a little disappointed, but then there are always lots of girls that are in need. You're gonna need a new wheel here... and have to replace the bumper. Fender's gotta be replaced. You got real bad turning problems, too. You need a shock tower. How long is it gonna take? Probably a radiator, water pump. This wheel's gotta go. Windshield, the door unit's gonna have to be new. The mirror. You're gonna have to have some dash work, too. Your roof is buckled, which means there's probably heavy frame damage. You're lucky nobody got hurt. You talked to your husband yet? Not exactly. He didn't seem to know about the insurance. He's not my husband! We're divorced. He just borrowed my car. I'll need the name of your insurance... I don't have any insurance! He has drunk driving arrests, I have no insurance. I'll need a deposit then to start work. MICHELLE: How much of a deposit? Umm... Twenty-five hundred. Twenty-five hundred dollars? Can I use your phone? I gotta call myself a cab. No way. Not after the day you've had. I'm gonna drive you home. I was about ready to knock off anyway. Okay, guys, let's lock it up. [DOOR SLAMS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. NELS: Hi. I was worried about you. Yeah. I'm in Marysville. Got a flat. Had to pull off the freeway to fix it. How are you? JANICE: Fine. How was your day? Okay. Um... I thought I'd stop by Donna's later. NELS: Mm-hmm. How'd it go with the Principal? Just a minute. Honey, why don't you go to your room and play, huh? Nels, I postponed the meeting until you could be there. Why'd you do that? JANICE: They won't keep him. He disrupts the class. What do you mean, he disrupts the class? JANICE: Nels, I've got some bad news for you. He did something. What? He bit the teacher. He did what? He bit the teacher. [BOTH LAUGH] Where? In the classroom. [BOTH LAUGH] Come on, Nels, it's not funny. Of course it's funny. Oh, please, Nels. What? Be serious. Okay. He needs... He needs a special class in a special school, in San Francisco. Jan, I don't want to talk about it now. JANICE: When will you talk about it? Look, I think I'll swing from here over to San Rafael and hit the Bay area. I'll be gone till Friday probably. Nels... Jan, I... I miss you. Sure. I do. I... I just... Well? Well, I'll... I'll call you tomorrow, okay? You don't have to. No, I want to. No, look... He's just slow, that's all. Sure. Nels... [HANGS UP] [DOORBELL RINGS] Hello. Hi. I need 2,000 by the first of the month. Come on in. Let's talk. It'll take care of the mortgage and pay Scottie's school fee. How about a glass of wine? No, thank you. I... Some coffee? No. I think I'll have that glass of wine, though. All right. Come on, sit down, we'll talk. And it's only until we get on our feet. Of course. See, I love him. He's a wonderful man. Of course he is. It's just that, you know, he won't admit that... Well, he won't accept the fact... Well, he can't admit that... we have... Well, our son is exceptional. Some men have fragile egos. I think he considers it more of a failure. Then you can help him, Janice. If he ever finds out... He won't. He won't. It's only until we get on our feet, you understand? Of course. You know, this just goes against everything. I don't even have anything to wear. I'll loan you something. It's all right. It's all right, huh? It's more than all right. It's necessary. MICHELLE: My parents were divorced, and they got married and remarried again. I have a lot of parents... stepmothers and stepfathers and uncles. I have a lot of uncles. Uncle Tom and Uncle Bob. And I developed very early. And so, Mother kept the uncles away and sent me to a girl's school. It was mostly girls from very wealthy families. I was the only one without a cashmere sweater. Girls can be very mean about that. CHIP: I absolutely refuse to discuss it. You're not going to drag me into any argument about a simple fender bender. Oh, my dear. Where have I seen you dressed like this before, hmm? How am I supposed to pay for my car? Well, obviously, the old-fashioned way. Aren't you glad I gave you the excuse? Moral indignation! Good! Shows pride and self-esteem, right? How would you ever recognize either? Maybe you could not do it. [DOOR SLAMS] [PARTY MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER & CONVERSATION] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I'll introduce Larry to Harry. Harry will take care of everything. Tom, I'd like you to meet my friend, Jane. Jane, Tom... How do you do? Hello. Tom is possibly the best lawyer in northern California. How nice. And our next Congressman. I'm impressed. Be good to him. Be good. Harry... True? What? Congress? Well, we'd like that to happen, yeah. Oh. Well, I never met a Congressman before. Well, I've met dozens of them and I can tell you that you're... I'm about to starve. How about you? I'm not really very hungry, but, boy, I sure could go for a drink. Now that's a good idea. Let's go over to the bar. I thought you'd be interested in these. This is a girl from Fresno. Could be your sister, right, Terri? She didn't die right away. The mutilations were done while she was alive. She died from loss of blood. This creep you're protecting beats up hookers because they're vulnerable and don't go to the police. One day he's gonna kill some girl in some hotel room, and you're protecting him. He's not too big. I don't know, 5'10", maybe 150 pounds. Blonde, wire-rim glasses. Kind of a soft face. BARTENDER: Sure is. [PHONE RINGS] Bar. So, why Congress? The next step. The next step in what? The process. What's the process? The accumulation of power. Why do you want power? What else is there? Truth, honor, love. Hmm. You look around. Read the papers, watch the news. Where's the truth? Where's the honor? Love? I'll leave that to you. You're the professional in that. Look, I'm sorry. That's not how I meant that. I do believe in love. In the possibility of love. Well, I believe in power. Hi. Amateur. No hooker wears a string of pearls. Some trick could strangle her with it. Dummy. Any girl wants to work this hotel... she's connected with me. Fifty percent. Understand? Give me your number. I don't have a pen. You're okay. Class. You don't want to work in that bar downstairs. I know a lady who uses classy girls like you. Sometimes we do parties together. It's a clean operation. No sleaze. Tell her Claude says it's okay. I don't want anything for it. Just goodwill. [DOOR SLAMS] [♪♪♪] Mother? She would have killed herself before she did it. She told me once, one night of confessions, that well, it was all for him, her husband, my Dad. My Dad. When I was six or seven, he would... he would lift me in his arms and dance to Frank Sinatra records. Hour after hour he would twirl me around... Laughing. Here I was, this six-year-old kid. I was tired. I wanted to go to bed. He kept twirling me around and around... and all I wanted to do was go to sleep. To this day, I can't stand to listen to Frank Sinatra. [♪♪♪] Sneak out the back door? Walk around the corner? Take a cab? No, that's not... Janice, sit down, and I'll make you a cup of coffee. Thank you, no. Thanks for the offer of the coffee. Thanks for the evening. Thanks for the present. [DOORBELL RINGS] You're up early. Come in. Look, Karen, I can't... do this again, ever. Let's have a cup of coffee. No, thank you. I thought I could go through with it, but I can't. I'm a married woman. I have a child. How can I ever feel right about myself? Maybe I can help you face some hard facts. Number one, it isn't going to be the end of you. I've been married. I have children. I'm still here and doing very nicely, thank you. Number two, it doesn't matter. It doesn't reach you. If you'd gone to that party straight, you'd have ended up at Tom's. You know and I know that. The money's incidental. And number three, it pays better than a waitress or a checker in a supermarket, which are jobs that you can't get anyhow. Number four, if you want to send that son of yours to a special school, this is the only way you're gonna be able to do it. Depressed? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Loathe yourself? My, my, my. Listen to me, Tom wants to see you again, often. Tom alone can put that boy of yours through that school. So, you listen to me. You think about it, and you call me. Good morning. DONNA: Hey. Hi, sweetheart. So, did you have a nice night at Aunt Donna's? Was it a good night? Oh, honey, Scottie was fine. He had a good time with Aunt Donna, didn't you, Scottie? Did you have a good time? Don't. Listen. What you do is your own business. Yours and Nels. And maybe somebody else's. Kids, let's go. It's late. Did you sleep on the bunk bed? SCOTTIE: Mm-mm. Good. You like that, don't you? Don't forget your lunch. Bye. I'll get you one one of these days. You're not the first one, you know. I, uh, had... Five years ago. Five years and two months. You don't understand. Sure I do. Nels is away from home a lot. You're alone, you're lonely. You met someone. Sure, I understand. Advice from an older sister. Whoever he is, just make sure you both want the same thing. I guess we do. [SOBS] Oh, God. Oh, baby. Honey, sweetheart. Listen, baby, I got over it. I took a look at my husband, and I took a look at the kids. And I knew they were what was important, and I got over it. And you will, too. Yes. Look, I gotta get out of here. I gotta get Scottie to school. Come on, baby, it's time to go to school. You didn't invent it, you know. I know. [♪♪♪] Hi. What a mess! Did you ever think about washing a dish? You could say good morning. Good morning. Oh, fine. What do you do all day? I know. I'm-- I'm sorry. I... I had to go to the seminar up in South Hills. So, you know, I get so confused when they start talking about variable low-rate mortgages. You want some coffee? I'll make you some breakfast, some eggs? No. Come on. No! Jack? Rumor is they're closin' down the line for three weeks. Probably longer. Uh, listen, uh-- you know Karen-- She agreed to split commissions with me on... property. It should be a few hundred dollars. They're laying off everybody with less than three years. Pretty soon, it'll be less than five years. Then I'll be gone. The... the only thing is, the property is in Las Vegas and I'll... I'll probably have to go there, but just for a few days. I'm turnin' in my card. I'm leaving this town. I'm sick and tired of watching it die. You? What about us? What about your daughter and me? You? No. Annie, no... I'm... I'm sorry. Listen, I was drunk that time. Honey, I lost my temper. I wouldn't hurt you. Annie, I would never hurt you again. No. That's funny. So... what about Las Vegas? Okay? Yeah, go. Go. [THUNDER] Mr. Hutchons? Sgt. Stampone, this is Officer White. Like to ask you a few questions. What about? Can we come in? You got a warrant? No, we don't. Do you want us to go get one? What do you want to ask me about? We wanna ask about a party you had the other night. What about it? Can we come in? Sure. Come on in out of the rain. Now, what about this party, Sergeant? Well, you had some women here at this party. A few women, yes. Where did they come from? Where did they come from? I don't know. They were here to entertain your guests, were they not? Entertain? What do you mean, Sergeant? Accessory to solicitation for prostitution is a felony. Pimping and pandering is a felony. You're accusing me of pimping and pandering? Just want to find out who the girls were, that's all. We know about Wanda, Brigitte. You better talk to my attorney, Sergeant. We'll be happy to talk to your attorney, but we'll have to take you in to do that, and we don't want to do that, and you don't want us to do that. So why don't you tell us who the ladies were and how they came about to be here? And then we'll go our way and stop embarrassing you. [CLEARS THROAT] Let me speak to him. This is Mason Hutchons. Tom, there are a couple of police officers here asking questions about some girls who were guests at a party here the other evening. Now, I don't know who these girls are or who they came with, but the Sergeant is threatening me with a charge of pimping and pandering. What's your legal advice? Mm. Can I have your badge number? Eight-four-six-one. Stampone. S-T-A-M-P-O-N-E. Detective Sergeant. Uh-huh. I should? Good. Right, Tom. My best to Marjorie. I'll get back to you if there's any trouble. Mm-hmm. He said you should charge me or get out of my house. Well, we might have to do that, Mr. Hutchons. Mm-hmm. Prominent businessmen, prostitution ring. We'll be seeing you, Hutchons. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, no, I think the best way to handle this, Bob, is just to send down a team of surveyors and let them check out that easement. I think they ought to use the... use the firm that we used the last time. They did a perfectly good job. Their lawyers are just screaming holy heck. Great. Okay. Appreciate that. And let me know as soon as you find out. Bye-bye. May I help you? Claude suggested I see you. I beg your pardon? Claude suggested I see you. Judy, why don't you take that coffee break now? Please sit down. I have to be at work. Oh, what kind of work do you do? Other work. What kind of work? I'm a secretary. What exactly did Claude say about me, uh...? Michelle. Jamison. Michelle Jamison. Michelle. That's a very pretty name. You have a very pretty face. What did Claude say? He said you were high class and honest. That there's no weird stuff. You take 30 percent? Claude always was a flatterer. Have you dated before? What difference does that make? I do take 30 percent, unless I provide the pad, then I take 40 percent. Don't worry about collecting. Just keep an accurate count. Thirty percent of how much? A hundred to three hundred. Sometimes more, never less. You get to keep the tips. Dated before? I know what to expect. Not what I asked. That is what I answered. You're real angry, aren't you? Aren't we all? And cold. [CHUCKLES] Men love 'em cold. PRINCIPAL: I gave Scottie's name to the McCarthy Center in San Francisco. They have the room and the resources. How is he going to go to San Francisco? They have boarding facilities. He'll get 24-hour care. Their boarding expenses are $700 a month. I've already inquired. There are agencies, welfare... There's Federal aid. My husband won't allow... My husband won't allow me to apply for help. You see, he doesn't believe Scottie is different. So, he won't allow me to apply for Federal aid. He just chooses to evade. So, what am I supposed to do? If you can't afford the boarding costs, he could be placed in a foster home in San Francisco. No. I won't do that. Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Vernon. McCarthy could bring Scottie up to his potential. Karen Gordon, please. Karen? Janice. Well, I've been thinking, and you're right. We survive. JANICE: Well, I daydream. My favorite dream used to be that we had a house by the sea. And in the mornings, I would make a picnic lunch. Nels and Scottie and I would go down to the estuary and eat chicken and drink lemonade. And Nels and Scottie would play touch football on the beach. And I'd lie in the sun, reading a book. The sun would be warm on my back and Scottie would rub oil on me. And we'd all be hot and tired and together, touching fingertips. And at night, after we'd tuck Scottie in, we'd listen to music. At least, that's the way it always happened in my dream. Nina, where'd you get beat up? I fell. What did he look like? Honey, you know they all look alike. Come on, give me a decent description, you can walk. I can walk? After I talk to the D.A. Five-nine, dirty blonde hair, thinning, straight, parted on the left side. He had squinty blue eyes and no moustache, no sideburns. Small wire-rim glasses and he had a scar on his chest. When you give a description, you give a description. Look, he knocked out two teeth and broke a rib. I ain't about to forget that sucker. Where'd you pick him up? At the Alameda Hotel. WOMAN [ON TV]: Lift. Lift. Lift. Lift. Lift. And lift. Lift. Eight more. Keep working those legs. [PHONE RINGING] Hear the music, girls. Six, seven and eight. Hello. Karen, hi. Tonight? Um... Yeah, sure. I can... Karen, um... do you have any dates I could take today? What? Yeah, I'm okay. Bye. WOMAN: Six, seven, eight. Shake 'em out. That's just great. Relax. Breathe in. MICHELLE: It doesn't mean anything. CHIP: It means everything. You do it because you like it. It's like you're trying to flush yourself down the toilet. I already did. I married you. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Whose is this? It's Karen's. Lucky Karen. Mm, I'll say. MICHELLE: What time is the flight? JANICE: They're due to touchdown at 11 o'clock. What are their names? Karen said Craig and Ron. I don't know the third one. Do you? No, I don't know. That'll be mine. I won't leave a note. I always thought that was impersonal. Besides, you'll criticize my spelling. Well, Mich, I guess I'll give you what you want. I'll clear out. Not with a bang or a whimper, just a friendly tape message... a few empty bottles, and a ticket for the cleaning I forgot to pick up. And a sincere, if tardy, wish for you to have a good life... whatever that is. The fact is, I always loved you, no matter what. That's probably of little concern and certainly no lasting importance. I have not lived up to my potential. Well... I wish you the best. And if you ever decide to give up your social work among the rich... you might give me a call. [MACHINE CLICKS] Half hour. I'm gonna go get a candy bar. A candy bar? ANNIE: Oh, come on, just one. You want a cigarette? No, thank you. Aw, come on. What, are you trying to kill me? No, I don't know you well enough. Thanks. Do you ever want to take a hammer and just smash the phone? No. You don't have to pick it up. Oh. I've been doing this a lot longer. How long? I turned tricks in college. Paid my tuition, actually. Really? Mm-hmm. I have a hell of a degree. A Master's. ANNIE: Surprise. Careful. What are these, doubles? No, just singles, Margaritas. Cheers. Cheers. Gee, there's a guy in there dressed up like Dracula. Reminds me of weirdos I've seen. There's a guy named Joe. You know Joe? Oh, no. Who's Joe? He's... He's this guy, you know. He's rich. ANNIE: Real rich. And for me anyway, he'd sent out a car and a chauffeur. Right? And then he'd just... The chauffeur drives you to his house, a nice house in Berkeley Hills. The house is fine, but Joe's got some problems. He, um... The idea was you had to sort of walk around the house, and when I did, well, I finally found him, and he was in a coffin. And he sat up, scared the hell out of me. And I screamed. And that was it. I mean, I went home. That was it, right? Hide and seek for 200 dollars. [ANNIE LAUGHS] That's funny? Well...yeah. You know, you run into all different kinds. Yeah. ANNIE: And some of the girls even specialize in weirdos, like Wanda. She is funny. She's really trash. And we aren't? We're what we are. It's what you are or what you think you are. Well, I'm new at this, you know. That doesn't last for long. JANICE: What do you mean? Being new at it? No, being new at it doesn't last for long. And once you've done it once, that's it. Then you're old at it. Well, it's not easy for me. Every time, it's... you know, it's different. I mean... I mean, they say like when you're naked, everybody's the same, but it just looks a little different. [ALL LAUGH] I think I'm okay. I mean, I don't walk the streets. I don't hang out on street corners. I do it part time. If I did it full time, it'd be different. It would? Yeah. Why? Because it would. You sound so, I don't know-- really angry. She's always like this. Does this make you feel that way, or--or... does home make you feel this way? Can't you-- MICHELLE: I make myself feel this way. You can't... Can't you change it? I tried. JANICE: When? What happened? Can you talk about it? I tried. I mean, I tried. I tried, you know? ANNIE: So, you don't want it to work? JANICE: You have a regular job? Uh-huh. I'm a secretary. ANNIE: Oh, that's good. JANICE: Where? At a P.R. company. ANNIE: Here, it's used. Thanks. JANICE: I'll bet that should be interesting. Public relations. Come on, come on. JANICE: I should think you'd meet a lot of people. "Mr. Ellison's office. May I help you, please? I'm sorry, Mr. Brown, Mr. Ellison is at lunch. Thank you very much, Mr. Brown." I mean, you know. "No, Mr. Brown, I can't go to lunch with you." I mean, it's just ridiculous, you know? I get babysitters, and my sister helps me out a lot. She has, God, she's got... She's got three beautiful kids. Beautiful kids, you know, all perfect. And, I think sometimes I'm really envious of her because of that. Everything is perfect there. They have their squabbles, their fights, but they... they have a reality in their household that they can deal with whatever it is. If the car breaks down, if someone... If one of the kids comes home with an "F," they deal with it because they're all healthy. They're all healthy. But with Scottie, he's not healthy. And it's even hard for me to leave Scottie with Donna and the kids because, um... because he's different, you know? And I... How long has it been since Jack made love to you? ANNIE: It's been since we had our baby. How about you? Um... ANNIE: That's not fair. I'm sorry. That's not fair! I'm not gonna fall out of love with my husband. I would like to have, but I just can't do that. I can't go out. I can't work like you. I can't work like you. There's nothing I can do. I don't have an education. There's nothing else I wanna do, nobody else I wanna be with. I want to be with him! Then I won't say another word. I'm sorry. [MICHELLE SOBBING] I'm not angry at you. I am not angry at you. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's all right. I just hate to see somebody... who's got so much going for them... and they don't get the opportunity... No, I'm okay, I just-- It drives me crazy. I wake up at three o'clock every morning. It's never two and it's never four. It's three o'clock. I lie there and I look at the clock... I can't believe I'm alone. Sometimes, you know, I look in the mirror... and I know I'm an ugly... ugly woman. Oh, don't be silly. Come on. You're beautiful. Come on. You're beautiful. She's beautiful. You're beautiful. [ENGINE REVVING] Show time. Let's go. ANNIE: Is my mascara okay? JANICE: Come on, let's go. ANNIE: Yeah. MICHELLE: Have fun, ladies. Oh, yeah. You refuse to understand. It's not me. Has nothing to do with me. It's as if the real me was standing off to one side watching the entire thing go on. I can feel her anticipation, her quickened heartbeat. Her palms are wet and her lips are dry, but it's not me. It's like watching yourself in a movie. It isn't me, but it is me. It's... It's exciting. 'Cause for that one hour, I'm in control. I control the situation. The men who... who run and regulate and ruin your lives, they're meek and they're quiet, and they're timid. I control the situation. And they want me to control the situation. It's all up to me. I like it. [POWER TOOLS WHIRRING] Hi. Hi. Seven-hundred fifty dollars. I'll have the rest next week. Think you could start on it? Maybe I'm a sucker for a pretty girl, but I got the guys working on it already. You're a very nice man. It's just my subtle way of bribing you to dinner. I don't think so. Somebody in your life? Not exactly. Then dinner, tonight? I have to work tonight. I thought you said you were a secretary? I am. I'm studying to get my real estate license. Why not a drink then, before? Can I take a rain check? No. I've got your car hostage. Okay. Saturday at lunch? PAUL: I'm not just a mechanic. I'm going to night school. Working on my Master's. I'm not gonna end up in a room watching TV like my old man. MICHELLE: What's your master's in? Don't laugh. Anthropology. Sorry. I said, don't laugh. The whole history of man is ten feet under the surface. Dig it out. Find out where we came from. How about dinner with me? When you find where we came from, will you know where we're going? Evidently nowhere. I don't understand. Is there something wrong with me? It's not your husband, is it? You said you were divorced. His name is Chip. Mm, Chip. He left last week for good. I'm sorry. He's an alcoholic. When we got married, his family gave us a bedroom set. He fell asleep with a cigarette and he burnt it up. He's wrecked three cars. He's lost jewelry. He ended everything. Yeah, you were his keeper then? No, protector. MICHELLE: Have you ever been lost? You find yourself rounding a corner, and the street and the stores and the faces of the people all look as if they're from a different country? And you want to stay. You want to leave the old neighborhood and join this new and warm welcoming place. [ENGINE RUNNING] SCOTTIE: When she walks... NELS: Hand me the wrench. SCOTTIE: she walks real funny. She's my best friend, Linda is. Linda, huh? Mm-hmm. Hi. Hi. When did you get home? A couple of hours ago. Where you been? I've been selling real estate. I was showing a house. Yeah? You're sure dressed nice to sell a house. Scottie, why don't you go inside and watch TV, huh? I can afford it. New clothes, Scottie's school, prime rib. Yeah? Congratulations. Scottie's really excited about school. You heard him. Nels, we're pushing him too hard, as if he were normal. Telling him three things at once, like put away toys and wash your face, come to the table. He can't sort all that out. He's learning all kinds of new things. By the end of the year, he'll be able to button his own shirt. How is this gonna look on his record? Some school for idiots? How's he gonna get into college? I told you, he... Soon he's gonna be able to button his own shirt. Nels, he is ten years old. He was born that way, day one. Do you blame me for it? Huh? No. Of course not. What's the future? Do you see any place in this world for Scottie? I pray for it. What happened in there? What do you mean? When did you start smoking? On occasion. Right after? After what? You... You were... You were a different person. No, same person. No. It was, um... What? I'm, uh... I'm away, living on the road out of a suitcase, catering to people I can't stand, trying to make a living. And I come home... What makes you think you're the only one who suffers? Do you hear yourself? Your voice? What's happened to you? To us. Hi. In the bar in the Alameda? You met a friend of mine. I need a friend, somebody to have a drink with. Somebody to have a good time with. How about it? Want me to call the manager? Nah, he's not my type. That's a joke. You're not very humorous, are you, Brigitte? You have the wrong person. Oh, no. I would never forget you. Just one drink. Come on. How 'bout it? Do you have any idea how many of my friends are shopping in this store? Look, what do you say I pay for this whole cartload of groceries... the whole thing, and of course another hundred, and maybe a nice bottle of wine and a cozy place to drink it? Brigitte... Bri-gitte. I have to be home by 3:30. Three-thirty. Right. At the cash register? Oh, and... make it vodka, not wine. Okay? Vodka. Right. [RECORDED VOICE] Michelle... it's Karen, darling. Just a reminder. Padreo Room. Drinks at five o'clock. [PHONE RINGS] Let me call you back. Hello, Santa Marta Realty. Karen, it's Michelle. Hi, Michelle. About tonight... I can't make it. What? I said, I can't make it. Why can't you make it tonight? I'm out of it, Karen. Come on, Michelle. Are you getting soft in the head over this mechanic of yours? Have you told him you're in the same line of work? Body work? Goodbye, Karen. Listen, Michelle, now don't do this to me. I can't replace you this quickly this late in the day. I need you to do this for me. Okay. I'll do it. Not for you. One last time. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [CAR BRAKES SCREECHING] Freeze! I said freeze! SGT. STAMPONE: This man who beat you up, I've been looking for him for months. Now I've got him... flat out, and you are my case. You've got a little girl. You don't want a police matron taking her to Juvenile Hall. You don't want your neighbors to see that. You don't want cops telling your husband what happened. Sign the complaint. No. Okay. Okay. Come sit down. And tell me about the others. What others? Maybe you'd like a drink of water? I am going to have to bust some of you amateurs, Annie. You read the paper. The community is upset. I don't want to, but I need names. I want to know how you make your dates, who and when. You've got to turn them over, honey. It's the only way you're gonna walk. I can't do that! Oh, God, look... Look, my husband. If Jack finds out, he will kill me. Do you understand that? I can charge you with suspicion of prostitution. You can make bail and walk, but the D.A. will prosecute. You'll go to court. No! Lots of publicity. Oh, come on. Your husband will be in the papers. Oh, please! Your child... No! Oh, come on! Come on, Annie! Give me the others. I can't. [SIGHS] You're allowed one phone call. I sure hope you've got an understanding husband. [♪♪♪] [PANTING] My wife's in here. I want to pay her bail. Her name's Ann Gilson. Got a woman named Gilson in the tank, wanna bring her out? Mr. Gilson, Sgt. Stampone would like to talk to you. You want to take a seat? [♪♪♪] Mr. Gilson, talk to you for a minute? What's going on here? Where's my wife? I don't really know how... All the years I've been a policeman, I've never seen anything like this. Seen what? Mr. Gilson, there's been an accident. I'm sorry to tell you that your wife is dead. She killed herself in her cell. I want it stopped, Claude, now! I'll put you on hold. Sure, I'd like to help you. What? Listen to me. A girl who tricked out of this hotel killed herself in my custody! My custody! Do you know how angry that makes me? You know damn well there is no prostitution. This is where he saw her first, her trick, your bar. Where you run the hookers, Claude. How about I park a couple units outside the hotel entrance? How about we ask for I.D. from every kid in the bar? How about a newspaper story that the hotel is being investigated for violation of health codes? How about I tell the manager I'm gonna do all this because of you, Claude? [♪♪♪] Let me call you back. No, that's all right. I'll call you back in five minutes. Yeah. Bye. Okay. [SIGHS] Look, there's a lady who books parties through the hotel. Lots of traffic. Could be this lady might know something. Write it down. Clear. Have you heard from Annie? No. She's late and not answering her phone at the house. It's not like her. Maybe she just got lost. Maybe. [♪♪♪] Uh-uh. First you pay... then we play. A hundred bucks? That's what you said outside, isn't it? Mm-hmm. What do I get for my hundred? Mm-mmm. You tell me what you want. Therefore, if you're a cop, it's entrapment. Come on, honey. What do I get for my hundred? I sure hope you're straight. Because if you're not, you missing out on a hell of a good time. For two hundred. That sounds real exciting, but I got some bad news. I am a cop, and you named a price and the act. You're under arrest for soliciting and prostitution. Wait a minute. Are you sure? You have the right to remain silent. A little cold in here? Not very. Well... Well... No kissing. Whatever you say. How much? Hundred. For what? Straight for a hundred. I'm sorry to inform you that I'm a police officer and you're under arrest for soliciting for prostitution. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up your right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you. This is entrapment, pure and simple. It's political. Just political. They have no case. By your confession to soliciting for prostitution... I've bargained with the D.A. ...you are fined 50 dollars and 30 days, suspended. If it is said that we are a society in disarray, I need no greater proof of it than to see this group of ordinary wives and mothers prostitute themselves. I trust your true punishment is the degradation you feel as you try to face your family and friends. He'll reduce your charge to aiding and abetting. But the judge wants you to do 90 days in County. And the alternative is two to four in Tehachapi if we go to trial. Ninety days? There's no other choice? You dishonored yourselves, No. sullied your marriage vows. You brought shame to your husbands and your families. See the clerk and pay your fines. We'll hear the cases on your gentlemen customers after lunch. [CAR BRAKES SQUEAL] Excuse me. Where are you going? South. L.A. San Diego. What I did, I did for us. Do you hear what you're telling me? Don't you see what you look like? When one of the girls in the office would come on to me, or some woman in a bar, I would take out your picture and I would show her. And I'd say, "See who I have waiting at home for me?" You think I'd jeopardize that? Well, all I have now is a bunch of dirty pictures in my mind of you with other men. [♪♪♪] Why didn't you just hit me in the guts with a hammer? It would have been easier. Because I couldn't get through to you, Nels! Listen, we're just people. I'm people. You're a whore. Come in. Moving? Leaving. For good? I've been calling. You don't seem to answer your telephone. Here I am, at the coffee shop, having a nice breakfast, thumbing the newspaper. What do I see? Why didn't you tell me? Protection. Mine? Yes. What makes you presume you know what's best for me? I knew what was best for me. Do you know what hurts me is that you didn't trust me enough to give me a chance to deal with it. I know. I'm sorry for that. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, too. [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] You never knew she had it? What was she saving it for? Why didn't she spend it? That's why...that's why we gotta leave here, CeeCee and me. I can't look at guys in the face around here. How many guys is all this money? She's out of it. So am I. Are you? Yes. You staying in town? What for? Phoenix. Maybe L.A. What about you? Oh. Scottie's in school. I have to keep him in the school. That won't be easy. They never said it'd be easy. They never said it would be so damn hard, either. [♪♪♪] Take care of your kid. Take care of you. [♪♪♪]
