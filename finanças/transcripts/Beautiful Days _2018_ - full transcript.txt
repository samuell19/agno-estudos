Zenchen, can you stop reading it? I have class tomorrow. How long have you been doing that? As my Mom committed the murder, she ran away to South Korea. There, she met Korean man and start a new life. Why are you living like this? You still haven't fixed it? I told you to fix it. You have become a South Korean woman. Your way of talking change too. Zhenchen grew up a lot, didn't he? I'm sorry. For what? I'm sorry. When I see Zhenchen again, I thought he will hate me. One time during his middle school Zhenchen didn't come home. We are really worried. After three days, That kid, came back home. And then, for some days, he shut himself up in his room he didn't go to school didn't talk, Later I learned that that kid went alone to look for his Mom. Do you have a good relationship with that man? Why are you asking about that? It's because I'm curious You can stop having a hard life, it'd be nice if you meet a good person, right? If I died, he only have you. I meet my Mom in Korea for the first time in 14 years And a year has passed again. I hate everything I should forget and continue living... Was Dad happy? What? I said, was Dad happy? It's what your Dad has left for you. Zhenchen I still have a lot of things to say to you. but God separate us. in your bank book is the money saved by your Mom for the past 14 years. Don't resent your Mom. 1997, China. you heard it right, you said you want to earn money in China Don't think about anything and just do as I told you. you will be different from the other women. the other women have to send the money they earn to their family There will be a man taking you, live there and run away eventually. I will take care of the rest. It's not difficult at all. Work hard, you need to pay your debt. choose comfortably. Don't ever think about doing that. the baby is innocent. It isn't your fault too. How can you pregnant? I just asked you to be more 'careful' for few months. **Again I'm sorry I can't hear what he said** When you can earn money again? this baby is the first and the last See you next time. My baby... can't be ... like that bastard. 5 years later Let's eat.
