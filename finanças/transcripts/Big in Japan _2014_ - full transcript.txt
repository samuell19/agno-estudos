Surf rock from Tacoma, Washington! Come on, "Pipeline," "Walk Don't Run," "Wipeout!" Come on, man! They've outsold the Beatles 2-to-1 in Japan. 2-to-1! So, that was awesome. [ Laughing ] But Japan? Well, it's an interesting idea. You guys, it's a great idea to go to Japan. I'm just saying two things-- A: Is that guy even who he says he is? Good question. And B: Did he even seem right to you guys? I mean-- What rock and roller seems right? I mean, I think that he's got almost more credibility. I'm sorry that I said "fuck you." But I just can't stand hearing the word "Nirvana." All right? Look, I was in a fuckin' rock band, man. Green River. This was fucking before there was Mudhoney and Pearl Jam, okay? When my band broke up, I moved to Japan. I was in bands. I lived the music scene. I'm going back in about a week, and I think you guys should go with me. I can get you some shows. I can show you around. And I know that they'll understand your brand of rock. And besides, the only way that you are gonna make it here... is if you make it somewhere else first. Just think about it. Yeah, listen, I would love to go. I'm all for it. I'm just saying, I don't know if I want to go with that guy 'cause he's a nut. I mean, frankly, I'm shocked that he didn't show up at the club in his bathrobe. [ Laughs ] Pretty intense, dude. Pretty intense. [ Sean ] Yeah. Hey, guys, check this out. "Green River is widely regarded... as being one of the originators of the genre... later known as grunge. Following the demise of Green River, Gossard, Ament and Fairweather formed the band Mother Love Bone and later Pearl Jam. Vincent, Green River's drummer, moved to Japan after the breakup... and did not return to the United States for many years." So, how much band money do we have? Including last night? Well, like, $12, minus gas money. Look, here's the thing. That guy is psychotic, but what he said does make a certain amount of sense to me. I mean, quite frankly, Seattle doesn't get us, and they've never gotten us. We've been together seven years, and nothing. I think Tokyo is our shot, you guys. - Agreed. - We've got a week to raise the money. Well, I just got fired. I have a little bit of severance, and maybe I can pawn off some of their bastard equipment. For my part of things, I can do a shit-ton of haircuts in a week. I can put some more blackjack trips on the books. Casinos have been sweating me lately, but if I work at it, I probably can get some more hours in. I don't think I have anything that I could sell. What about that money? - What money? - Dude, Drury, that is a lot of money, man. This is the team's money. It doesn't belong to me. Would they break your kneecaps if you took it? Well, it's not like-- it's not like that. You could just say that you lost it on a bad hand. That happens all the time. Well, yeah. I mean, we don't need all of it. Just most of it. Well, are you planning on coming back? I'll be back in two weeks. - Who's going with you? - Just the guys. Hmm. No girls? No. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Well, if you cheat on me, I'll cut your balls off. Babe, I'm not gonna cheat on you. Hmm. Well, if you cheat on me, I'll cut their balls off. All right. Honey? I know you're stressed out with exams, and I lost my job, and we've got the back taxes, and the kids' orthodontist bills are astronomical, and we've got the oil tank that's empty, and the mortgage, and the plumbing is leaking and backing up simultaneously, and the dishwasher's on the fritz, so I understand. - But me and the guys have been talking-- - Mm-mmm. Well, do you wanna hear what I-- No. If it involves the guys, no. No. You have so much to do around here. Not the guys. You've done enough with those guys. Okay, I hear you. I-I really do. I understand, and I agree with you. You're right. But, honey, I know that Japan is gonna-- Japan? love what we have to offer. Are you serious? Why? I know it's crazy, but those are the people that are gonna like our music, and I just know that they're gonna connect with us... in a way that Seattle hasn't connected. Japan. Japan. That's-- That's gonna do it for you. I wanna know that we've done everything we can... to achieve some kind of success. Well, you could just move on. It's been, what, five years since you guys have finished a new song? Is it just writer's block, or are you finished? I think if you just let me go to Japan and do this thing, if we don't come back with an audience, then we'll be done. - No more band. - No more band. So, uh, who's gonna pay for this? Well, that's a good question. Look, Drury, you don't wanna do it, you don't have to. Yeah, I just don't want you to feel pressured by us. Drury, 10% of your winnings tonight... should easily be enough to get us to Tokyo. And don't feel bad about taking the casino's money... 'cause they don't feel bad about taking your money. Just think, man: Japan. Major label record deal, beautiful Japanese women. - You can do it. - You do this all the time. This'll be cake. Let's do it. Yeah! Let's do it! Holy shit, you guys! I can't believe we lost all that money! Dude, Drury, I'm sorry, man. That totally sucks. That was, like, $40,000! Fifty. Holy shit! Phil, you're not making it any better. Why did you have to say anything? - What? - [ David ] Phil! That was our big chance when the dealer adds her cards wrong and starts paying the table. That shit happens. You take the money and walk away. You don't call it out, not when I had the big bets out there. It was confusing. Phil. If you were playing baseball and you slid into home plate... and you knew you were out, but the umpire called you safe, would you start arguing the call? I don't know. I don't even know how to make a touchdown. You guys, we're gonna find a way to get there. Well, we're all broke, and Alex leaves in a week. Maybe if you promise your firstborn. That's it!

Uh, "Which one of you guys plays tennis?" - And which one of you plays? - None of us. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Hence the name. Yeah. Why did Tennis Pro come to Japan? What made you guys decide to come here? We just thought maybe this would be a place we could come and people would like our music. I definitely feel a warm reception from the people here. You know, 'cause in the States, it just-- it wasn't really happening for us. I mean, we had some success, but-- I don't want to say that it's a dead end, but, I mean, it kind of-- We know how that story ends back home. My job as a journalist, I interview people all the time, and I had all these interviews lined up-- film directors, rock stars. And everyone canceled immediately after the earthquake. You guys stayed. What's up with that? In the wake of all of that, you know, a lot of those bands that did cancel, we had the opportunity to be their replacement band. Mmm. And it was a tremendous opportunity. And I kind of feel like we made all these friends, and we wanted to be with them. And, uh, I don't know, I guess in some fashion shoulder what they were feeling and be there for them, you know? We could tell that people were affected by the music... and by the fact that we stayed and played. When talking about the music scene in Seattle, several times you used a phrase like "dead end" and "going to a dead end." Does that mean that the band might end sometime soon? That's sort of a hard question to answer. I have a hard time seeing how it makes sense for us to keep going. So I don't know. I guess that's a very, very real possibility. I'm surprised to hear though that you might end the band... 'cause, um, you know, at your last show there was a rep from Import Records-- [ Coughs ] um, at your show. Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah. He was definitely there to see you 'cause he left right after you guys stopped playing. And he watched our set? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've interviewed the guy before for my work, so it was definitely him. You don't have his phone number, do you? I might still have his card. You didn't know about that, huh? I didn't know that, no. Oh. Sorry. Alex really came through. I can't believe it. I thought the Import Records thing was just a load of crap. Well, since this guy set up the dinner, does that mean he's paying? You guys, don't order anything else. If this guy doesn't end up showing up, we have to pay for all this. Well, you said he was coming. Well, he was supposed to be here an hour ago. Tennis Pros. How's it going? I'm Dax. - I'm Sean. - Sean, nice to meet you. This is David. David, nice to meet you. - Phil. - Yeah. Um, so, hey, you guys thirsty? Yeah. - Sake? You like sake? - Yeah. Sake. Suimasen. So, how do you guys know Alex? That's kind of a long story, but we met him back in Seattle, actually at one of our shows. Uh, look, he told me to come see your show. I checked it out, came to that basement bar-- I think it was Statto or something-- and I have to say I liked what I saw. You guys were poppy. You know, it was energetic music. And I think you guys have got some potential. But let me cut to the chase. I got a big show coming up, and we're short acts. So you want us to play the show. Well, only bands on our label can play. Oh. So what I'm wondering is, would you guys like to join the roster at Import Records? Uh, so you wanna sign us? Yes. But it's short notice. Show's coming up in two days. We got hotels that'll cover accommodations for artists. We can check you in as early as tonight. We would love to check in. What's the attendance at this festival like? Normally about 10,000, but I would say, given the earthquake and the situation, give or take a few thou. You guys comfortable with big venues? Yeah, for sure. Gonna be a little bit of a change from Statto. - Yeah, I mean, we're up for it. - Sounds awesome. Well, in that case, kanpai. Kanpai. Welcome to Import Records. Right, so I'm not gonna be able to stick around, but here's my card. If you have any questions, talk to my secretary. She'll set you up with the hotel. And dinner, drinks on Import Records. You celebrate, okay? And I look forward to seeing you guys soon. Amazing. Suimasen. Can we order some food, please? [ Whispers ] Sweet! Oh, yeah. You guys, are you kidding me with this?

The label's excited about signing the band, and it's gonna be great. Yeah, that sounds great. That sounds awesome. So, yeah, there's just one thing. We loved the music. Alex told us about the tennis outfits. We think they're a great marketing angle. But, yeah, the main thing is, you guys gotta lose the clown. The clown? It's your bass player. Look, I saw him at the show, with the polka dot tie and tails. The guy's a joke. You need someone with more sex appeal. Yeah, well, Phil's more than just our bass player. Phil and I have been friends since we were kids. Phil writes half the songs. I mean, he started Tennis Pro with us. Sean, Sean, Sean. We've got a bass player lined up for the show. Phil is out.
