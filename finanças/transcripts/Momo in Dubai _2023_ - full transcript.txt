Why did you come to me, instead of going with the other ants? Are you upset with them? I am upset with everyone too. I know that you're not capable of asking me why. I have seen my Grandma talking to the cow, while giving water to it. Even that cow doesn't say anything back to Grandma. So you too can't, right? So anyway, you must listen to what I have to say now. Or else, you shouldn't have come to me. Don't think that I don't have anyone else to talk to. But right now, I am not on talking terms with them. [Indistinct Chatter] Keep quiet. I will announce. Hello! Convener of the welcoming party,Mr. Anuttan... I have some terrible friends! They are my biggest problem now. You will realize that later. Anutta! What? What is it? Our gang has a captain. Huh? Who is that? - It's me! - Oh, okay. So, Anutta... Us, the boys will present the bouquet this year. Huh? Boys? Yes, Momo will give it. Do you have a problem with that? Then what about us? - You can give water. - What? Anutta, we will present the bouquet this time. - We will present it. - Let's see how that happens. Give it to me! - Momo! - Any one of you give it! - Give it back, Momo! - Come on, guys! You can go and give water. If you don't we will give that too. Yes, he's here. - We will talk after the programme. - Babuetta, over here. - Where are you? - Look down! You're so late when you're the Panchayat President. We will fix everything, Anutta. What will be the case when you become a Legislator? We will fix everything. You just go there and shower me with praises. That's all set. It's okay. Everyone, please pay attention. Though he's a little late, our Panchayat President has arrived. I humbly request all of you to gather before the stage. - Where is the bouquet? - It was with you, right? You took it with you. - It was with you! - You took it with you. What are you saying? The bouquet was with you! My dear Anutta, I don't need a bouquet. Start the programme. That's not possible! We won't let the programme happen without Momo. - Dear! - Where is this kid? Dear Momo, if you are anywhere nearby, you should come to the stage with the bouquet, immediately. Even if the bouquet is not there, we can start the programme if Momo comes. See what happened? I told you back then, right? What will happen? Momo will come. He will come now! Let's see. Momo is missing! Go inside and check! Momo! Is Momo here? He's not there. Come on! Where did this boy go? Go inside and check. Go, go! - Is Momo here? - He is not there. Come. - He's not there. - He might be here. He must be here. Let's see. - Go and check, Boys! - Momo! - Is Momo here? - He's not here. He's not here too. Come on! Hey, Momo is here! - Yes! - Momo! The boy is here. - Hey, get up! - Get up! - Momo! - Hey, Momo! - Get up! - We have a dance now. - Momo! - The Panchayat President is waiting. - Get up! - Momo! He won't let go of the bouquet. So, we brought him along with us. This is why I said that my friends are all terrible! They wanted to humiliate me! Or else, would anyone do something like this? Dear, there's mud on the road. How much does this kid sleep! What will we do if he goes on like this? Yes. They performed the dance without him. Phew! And finally, we reached! Allah! My boy waited for so long, dressed up in this costume. That was not fair! Now I will have to hear all his complaints tomorrow. Isn't it because that President came late... that our boy couldn't perform on stage? You should give him an earful when you see him. Let me meet him tomorrow. - That's it. - Come. Even though I am the hero of my team, I too have a weak point, like all heroes. When it's past 7:00 p.m., my battery gets switched off. No matter who calls me, I won't wake up after that. Unless I fall asleep, my enemies can't do anything to me. There was no solution, even after consulting doctors. Yes! Beautiful boy! Dad and Mom went to bed. I will show you something. What's it? Show me. Your son shining in his dance costume! - Oh! - Look at him! - What's on his face? - What have you done to him? You will get it from me! Hold this. It's just a small drawing! Muthutty! How come I didn't get videos of your dance? Why didn't you send it? You should have come here, right? Then you could have seen the entire dance. You won't come, right? So, you guys don't want any toys? Oh, toys! I will come there with plenty of toys for you! I'm trying to earn money for that here, right? We don't need anything. You just come here. Hmm. I will come soon. Okay? I will send you the videos, Muthutty. But you must tell us when you're coming. This vacation, I will come for sure. I will definitely come. Okay? Okay. [children laughing] - Shame! Shame! - Don't laugh! Don't laugh! I'll hit you all with this book! No problem. Oh no! Our teacher is here! Oh God! Such a ruckus! Good morning, teacher! Good morning! It was such a ruckus! I could hear you all from over there! I heard that yesterday's programme was awesome. Yes, teacher. Momo was truly awesome! There's a photo on the newspaper. We saw it, teacher. Dude, didn't she finish teaching all the portions? Why has she come to irritate us again? Mohammed! - What's going on there? - Nothing. He wants to go and play. - When did I say that? - Get lost! You get lost! Look here, Mohammed. You want to go and play? Exams are coming up, right? And you want to play around? You don't study at all. You just loiter around! Only if you have a plan now, can you become successful like me in the future! - Isn't it? - Yes! I will become a teacher immediately. Shall we do one thing? Okay! You should tell me what you want to become in the future. - Okay? - Okay. Tell me, Irshad. Doctor. Doctor! I want to be a policeman. - Thief becoming a policeman? - You? A policeman? - I will become one! - You will! - Military! - Teacher! Photographer. Photographer! You should click my photo, okay? Doctor! Doctor! Very good! Super! Everyone is superb! Well, what do you want to become, Momo? Tell me. What do you want to become? - I want to become. - Yes, you want to become... What do you want to become? - I... - Don't you want to become someone? I want to become. [Howling] Don't laugh! You guys keep making noise all the time! Sit down, Momo. Can you draw us a picture, teacher? Well, it's always me who draws pictures, right? Yes. - Today, you guys can draw pictures. - Okay. Oh, it's superb! You've colored it as well. Good. Hey, what's this? Look at the picture he has drawn! - Just two lines! - What is it? Burj... It's the Burj Khalifa. - Burj Khalifa? - Yes. This one? It's much taller, Teacher. But there's no space on the paper. You'll come up with retorts to whatever I say? Don't try to be over-smart over here. You're yet to grow up, right? To all of you, I'll be sending a photo of me standing in front of the original Burj Khalifa. You can make fun of your teacher and learning to draw from that photo. So, are you going to Burj Khalifa? Oh! I forgot to tell you! - We won't have vacation class this time. - Okay. I am going to Dubai to visit my husband. - Is it? - Yes. That's what the officer said after rejecting the application. What are you saying, Muthutty? It's been two years since you left, right? It was you who told the kids... that you will come during the vacation, right? This issue happened because Izawi took emergency leave and left suddenly. If I stay adamant and take leave, what's the guarantee that I will have this job when I come back? Right now, I am planning to secure the position of Safety Officer, right? Here. Balance? Tell this to the kids yourself. I won't be able to tell them. They are expecting you. What's this? Don't be mad at me, Khadiju. Not me. The kids will be mad at you. We'll send that photo to Muthutty anyway. - Let him see it. - I'll beat you if you do it! Yeah, right! It will cost a lot of money. Won't it, Muthutty? Will all this be possible if we wait for our financial woes to be over? I thought about all that before deciding. Kunjali is throwing a fit over there. If he had this much money and comfort, shouldn't he be repaying his debts first? Is he the only one who makes money from the Middle East? - Why are you saying all this? - Our Hussain... He has been struggling in the Middle East for so many years now! Has he ever taken his wife and children to the Middle East? No, right? What will I say to the husbands of Sainaba and Shakeela? Their gold is still pledged in the bank. - It's of no use! - Leave my hand, Momo! [Indistinct Chatter] All of you go inside! Oops! He just has to sit there and decide things. I'm the one who's answerable the townsfolk, right? Well, Kunjali... Try to think from his shoes. If I die here, I'm not even sure whether my body would reach home. That's the situation. You just do as we decided. - We will deal with the rest later. - Where is Habib? - Habib? - Yes, Sir. Coming. Okay then. Hang up. - Peace be unto you. - And unto you be peace. What are they arguing about? It's nothing. I have to tell you something. What is it? There's a good news, and a bad news. Which one do you want to hear first? - Good news. - Bad news. Can you say both together? I will say the bad news first. Muthutty won't come here this time. Hey Momo! - What is it? - Come here. What is it? Listen to the good news before you leave. Then, say it! Since Muthutty can't come here, he has asked all of us to go to Dubai. Wow! - Is it true? - It is true. Really? Really, Shanumol! God promise? God promise! Look! - Muthutty had just called. - Where is it? Let me see. Is it true? We are going to Dubai. Yaay! I am going to Dubai! Momo is going to Dubai. I'm going to Dubai. "Dear precious!" Momo is going to Dubai! He's the one who ruined the programme. "Let us consider our dreams as precious as gold." - Brother! - Yes! Give sip-ups to all of them. It's on me! - What's special? - I'm going to Dubai. At this age? I'm not going there for work. I'm going to meet my dad. Oh yeah! Hey! Kids! - Hey! It's the teacher! Run! - Hey! Don't go! My money? I'll pay it once I come back from Dubai! Hey! Slow down! Wait! Wait! - What is it, Teacher? - I have to tell you something. There's vacation class this time. So, you aren't going to Dubai? No! My husband's leave was sanctioned. Teacher, you don't worry. I'm going to Dubai this time. I'll send photos from Burj Khalifa to you, daily. Didn't you know? I am going to Dubai. Really? Hey seniors! I am going to Dubai. Is it? Then we're going to America. Senior, I am serious! Get lost! Did you know? I am going to Dubai. Did you know? I am going to Dubai. Gireeshetta, I am going to Dubai. Wow! Get me a Visa when you come back. - Visa? - You don't know all that? - How much will it cost? - It's not so expensive. I'll get one for you then. Okay, bye! Did you know? Momo is going to Dubai. Where is Momo? Over there. Sheesh! How can I eat these mangoes after going to Dubai? You can eat up the cars after getting there. "Let us fly over the wind and the hilltop with our desire." Dude, Dubai has huge aquariums and big fish too. Come on, bend a little more. Hey! We got the fish! "No limit... There is no limit." "No limit... There is no limit." "Are you not coming? Are you not twinkling?" "It's like the shining gold close to our chest." Momo, come on! I had a bath at home. - It's so much fun. - Hey, idiot. He's scared of the water. - Momo, come on! - Don't laugh! Didn't I tell you that I had a bath at home? "The time to struggle for fulfilling our dreams." "Let us safeguard our aim in the mind without getting diverted." - Momo! - Yes! They've finished shopping, right? Why isn't yours over yet? Can I wear Shanumol's clothes? And one more thing. I am going to DUBAI! And if I go there without wearing proper clothes, what will the Arab people think of me, Grandpa? How's this one? "There is only one life." How is this one? "Dear precious!" "Dear precious!" I'll hold it, Grandpa. "Let us consider our dreams as precious as gold." "Dear precious!" "Dear precious!" Dear... Shall we leave, Dad? Okay. Go and come back safely. - See you. - Okay. - I have to tell you something. - What's it, Aunty? When you reach there, please go and meet Hussain Ikka. Who knows how he is doing! It's been so long since he came here. I will definitely go and meet your husband. I will tell him that his girl is a bit heartbroken here. Now I have to go to the town alone for dressing up Sulfi's hand, right? There's only one more dressing left for him, right? Tell him to take rest for 14 days after that. That's all. - Shall we leave, Mom? - Yes. Why are you crying? I will make a video call after I get there. - Let her go happily, Sister. - Okay then. Take good care of Momo, dear. I know that, right? So, I will explain everything clearly to you. I will return after a month. Until then, our gang's leader will be... - Omar! - What? - Me? - Yes. You! Is there any other Omar here? Another thing... I have the list of the WhatsApp numbers of all your parents. Everyday, I will... - Take your hand off! - What's wrong with you? I will send you a photo of me standing in front of Burj Khalifa, daily. But when it's night here, it will be day over there, right? There's only a time difference of 1.5 hours. He is not going to America, right? Be it America or Japan, - Momo is leaving the country. - Come, Momo! I'm coming! Good bye! See you! What a show off! Momo! Take care! - Bye, Momo! - Bye! Sitting in the flight, I want to see the sky up close. I want to see the ocean below. I want to eat the in-flight meal twice. Oh beloved God, please don't let Shanumol and Dilu get window seats! Shanamol, we should go to Burj Khalifa as soon as we reach the airport. I need to click a photo and send it back here. - Everything else can wait. - You idiot. We'll be landing at Abu Dhabi airport. You can't see Burj Khalifa from there. Shana! - Here! - There's Muthutty! Come that side. Yes. Yaay! How are you? He slept when we boarded the flight. - This idiot won't wake up? - No. Hey! Hey, Momo! - I tried waking him up. - What's this, man? No use calling him. - Shall I carry him? - Yes. You can try waking him up. - What's this? - Momo! - His underwear is sticking out. - Let's go! Take everything. He has gained weight. Come. You didn't sleep at all? I didn't sleep. Did you sleep? Yes. A little bit. - Hey, it's a long drive. - Okay. Get some sleep. Have I come here to sleep? Don't sleep then. - We've reached? - Yes. Shana! Dilu! We have reached. Wake up! Hey, it's heavy. Move aside. I will lift it. Careful. Hold it now. - Move your leg. - Didn't you take my bag? It's this one, right? - Brother! - Yes. Yes, brother. One minute. Well brother, how is the room? - It's perfect. - Okay. - I showed you one the other day, right? - Yes. This one is better than that. I told you, right? Another family is also staying there. It better be good. Or else, I will be in trouble! It's a good one, brother. What the hell! Well... It needs 5 minutes of work. It's not completely set. Well, you guys take rest. - Meanwhile, I will... - Take rest? Where will we rest here? In the car. You can rest in the car, right? - Hey Habib! - Yes. I'm taking the car, okay? Will there be snakes here? Momo, my leg! You hurt me, Momo! Walk carefully! Can I stomp you with my head instead? I had found another house initially. It slipped out of my hands though. I just got this one yesterday. So, I couldn't check it properly. - Move aside. - It will be alright if we clean it. Hold this. Oh! It doesn't need much work, right? I'll sort it out right away. - It will be over soon. - Okay. Well, where should I keep this? - Keep it there itself. - Okay. Where do we begin? Hold this, Shanamol. - Dilu! - Yes. - Come here. - Okay. Dilu! Momo, come and hold this. Please! - Hold this. - Huh? - Hold this! - Hmm. Come on, turn. Come. Come. Don't lift it like that. While lifting a heavy object, - you must do it like this. - Hello! You and your safety methods! Come. - There it goes! - You should be careful, Dilu. Why isn't this opening? Don't open it. Don't open it, okay? Oh no! Dinosaur. - Elephant. - Should I take this chair outside, Mom? Bring that chair and carpet. - Okay. - Okay. Isn't it obvious that should be taken outside, Dilu? Aren't you done, Momo? - How long has it been? - Mamma calling! Come out fast. Mom! Come fast! - Mom! - This boy! Mom! Come fast, Mom! Peace be unto you! And unto you be peace! It's Uncle. Khadija and the kids have arrived, right? Yes, yes. They are here. We were planning to come there. Oh my dear, please don't bring her here. I will come there when I can. Where is Khadija? I... I'll put her on. She is here. I'll put her on. Hello. Uncle. - Peace be unto you. - And unto you be peace! How is it going, dear? You reached safely, right? I'll come there one day. Inform the kids too. I am tied up with work here. - Shall I hang up? - Hello Uncle! He hung up. He didn't let me say anything. He is like that. We can't say anything back to him. What is his actual job over here? Well, he does a lot of things. I have no idea. But he survives, somehow. When I left from there, Aunty had asked me to tell him something. What? To ask him to stop working here and return home. He has a lot of liabilities. Is it? Well, I'd like to help him out. Help? You? Why are these people so happy? I don't feel happy. Right now, I feel that... Burj Khalifa is farther away from here, than from Kerala. This is such a trap! - Khadiju. - Yes. Didn't you inform everyone that you are coming here? If not, everyone will start blaming me. I had told as many people as possible. Even then, there won't be any shortage of complaints. - Hey. - Yes. Will you be upset if I say something? It's the right time to get upset. Tell me. Well, In the morning, Dilu had asked... why that room is locked, right? - Yes. - I had also wanted to ask that. Then why didn't you ask? I thought, when we're tired after cleaning the place, you'd open that room in Arabian style... and give us a surprise! You don't know me well enough, huh? I realized that when I arrived here. That realization cost me four tickets! It's not a waste of money. Yes, it's not a waste of money. Oh! Good night! 'Azan' [Call for Islamic Prayer] Do you usually wake up this early? What's with this uniform? This is the kind of uniform that doesn't catch fire. Here. Drink this. It's hot! Careful! So, your workplace catches fire easily? Sshh! Won't they wake up? Lower your voice. So, your workplace catches fire easily? Yes. We wear this for safety. - Okay? - Okay. Look. That's my bus. If you leave now, when will you return, Muthutty? In the evening. Okay then. - Won't you come quickly, Muthutty? - Yes. Leave now. I will come soon, okay? You leave now. Bye! Hello! Excuse me! What is this? Come. Come down, please. Come down. Hey Habib. HSE manager is calling you. Okay. What's the matter? I told you these many times. Please, guys. Be careful. Habib, you are in charge this week. Right? Yes, Sir. Then tell me. Why is it like this, Habib? When you work in height, you have to tie the harness. Everybody knows that. This is basic step. If any accident happens, it will impact our man hours, asset damage and what not! So you have to get back to your family safely. Always remember that. - Habib. - Sir. Their safety is your responsibility. Sure, Sir. - Okay? - Okay. Shanamol. I don't think this guy will able to see Burj Khalifa. Where does he think Burj Khalifa is? I think Muthutty tricked him. Then you guys also won't see it, right? Well, we don't have to boast... in front of Kochunni, Rema teacher and the townsfolk, right? So, Momo is done for! - Poor guy! - Momo is done for! It will be like this once you get married, have kids and go to the Middle East. I don't know about it. Anyway, you are doing well there. You said you're going to the Middle East and left. After that, there was no news or photos from you. Hey. There is nothing here that's worth sending photos. We are living in a place that's similar to a desert. Muthutty goes for work in the morning itself. I cook food. I check Facebook for some time. What else is there to do? Well, I am thinking of starting a YouTube channel Mom! But I'm just worried about the kids. - Mom! - What is it? Have you brought us to a desert where there's not even a single camel? Mom, everyone will ask for photo of Burj Khalifa when we return home. Do you know what this is, Mom? Momo said that he will send a photo of him standing in front of Burj Khalifa, right? This is the list of the WhatsApp numbers of those kids. Give it, Dilu! What will he say when they ask for the photo? - Give it. - You guys calm down! - Momo! - Yes. Stand over here. Give me some time. Let me think. Do you know what's the first thing that people do after reaching the Middle East? What is it? You must send a letter back home, to inform that you've reached. A letter? - In this period? - Yes. Get a pen and paper. Start writing, "To my most respected ones"... and send a letter jotting down all that's happening here. Well, what is happening here? Let me explain. We'll take an airmail cover which has an airplane’s picture... and the fragrance of the Middle East, and put this letter inside it. Then we will stick a stamp with the Middle East's picture on it... and put this letter inside a post box. Then, our relatives back home will... wait several days for this letter to reach them. So, when they are waiting for it to reach them, the postman will make a grand entry... on his bicycle with this letter. Tring, Tring! When they open the letter and read it, the face of the person who wrote it, will appear on the letter. Tears, laughter, sadness, complaints... The face will appear with all those emotions. Come. I have a job for you guys. Here you go. Give it! What are you doing? - What? - Nothing. Go away. Grandpa, we go for long drives in my dad's BMW car daily. Grandma, in our house in Dubai, there's a machine that prepares all the food once you switch it on. The roads over here are not like the ones over there. It's as smooth as travelling on a plane. And the airplanes aren't small, like the ones we see in photos. They are huge! Dear Grandpa and Grandma, Are you fine over there? From the 50th floor of our apartment here, we can see Burj Khalifa from the balcony of my room. It looks even better during nights. It's fully lit up during the nights. I am writing this letter now... since Mom asked us to do so. I will write the rest later. Our kids have become very luxurious! We should make their dreams come true, as much as we can. If God wills it! Well, there should be some dreams left for them to fulfill, right? The kids are not old enough to understand our philosophy, right? Sit down, dear. - Do you know something? - What? This world is a conflict between philosophy and life. At midnight? Have you written any letters? You won't have the energy to survive my letter. You can sleep now, dear. Haven't you realized now that... going to Burj Khalifa is not so easy? And the most important problem is that... Muthutty has a holiday only on Fridays. So, things won't move forward without precise planning. So, considering all that, we made a chart. Muthutty should see it everyday when he wakes up. Stick it properly at the bottom. Shana and I went through a lot of trouble to make this. So, we know how to stick it. Oh God! Look at my kids' enthusiasm! If this was a school assignment, I would have had to force you to do it. - This was taught in school, Mom. - Is it? But it came in handy only during the vacation. How is our creativity, Mom? My kids are brimming with creativity, right? When Muthutty saw the creativity in your letters, he became really upset. You were the one who told us to write it, right? - Momo! - Hmm. So, next Friday... he is going to take all of us to see Burj Khalifa! Really? Hey, when Muthutty returns, don't make a fuss about Burj Khalifa again. I'm telling this to you. - I won't. - Okay. I won't. Hurray! Muthutty, Muthutty, yaay! Yaay! - Let him come. - Yay! - Why didn't it stop? - It left? What happened? He comes at this time usually, right? After what Mom told us that day, we waited for Muthutty's bus to arrive. But... Muthutty was not there in the bus. My return ticket is on 13th, not 30th. I have a lot of work here. Bye. Habib. Have it. - Thanks. - So... for Safety Officer position, there are some things to do. I told you before. - Remember? - Yes, Sir. First, you have to complete the training... for Nebosh exam. You have happy news. You can go to your country for short leave. And continue the training and come back with the certificate. Habib. Is everything okay? Okay, Sir. Then why you are not happy? Nothing, Sir. Hmm. Okay. Sir, he is my son. Oh. Alright, Sir. Thank you. Would you like to meet my family? Oh, Habib. Next time, God willing! Okay, Sir. - Habib. - Sir. Remember, this is a good opportunity for you. I understand, Sir. - Good. - Thank you. - Peace be unto you. - And unto you be peace. What is it, Momo? Did you get bored? Yes, a little. We will get rid off your boredom. Come. Muthutty. Let's do one thing. Let's all go home. So, you can be there and study comfortably. You guys just came here, right? If we plan to go back right away, it will cost us a lot of money. Moreover, if we go home, my mind will get distracted. I won't be in a mood to study. What will we do then? I have to prepare for the exam anyway. And, the company will provide the coaching. But the fees... We have to arrange that ourselves. Listen! We must spoil Mom's plan to return home, at any cost. So, we have to provide all the help for Muthutty to study. Okay? - If Muthutty... - Lower your voice. Okay. If Muthutty passes his exam, he will get promotion and a salary hike. Oh! Maybe, we will even get to stay near Burj Khalifa. That night, everyone was very sad. But even then, I was thinking of something else. However much you grow up, there's no end to exams, huh? Anyway, I asked them to find a solution to things, and got on to my routine. This fellow! One slap! "Climbing on the wings of a chirping dove" "Desires are piling up like a mountain" - Hello. - What are you doing, Muthutty? I'm studying. "For the beauty all around to turn fresh" "Some smiles will bring forth a thousand colours" "As an awesome company for the student" "The programme is taking different routes" "This training solution is continuing without stumbling" "Giving a holiday to worries" "Finishing this task with full vigour" "It's only fair to gulp down the syrup of immense success" "There's a swing on the branch of new dreams" "Don't you want to reach for the skies?" - Khadiju... - Well, Muthutty... Do we have to share the kitchen as well? Of course. It's theirs as well. I... I will call you when I get back to my room. Mom, I need tea! "Though there are different kinds of madness" "Though sleep may arrive during the day" "Are you climbing the steps daily, without being lazy?" "Without citing excuses, without being hesitant" "You fly all over the sky" "There's a swing on the branch of new dreams" "Don't you want to reach for the skies?" "Climbing on the wings of a chirping dove" "Desires are piling up like a mountain" There's a message from Momo. Oh, a foreigner? Show it to me. What's up with you? Hey, Momo! We don't want your photos with foreigners. Send us photos of the Burj Khalifa. Okay? "Let's move forward with precise steps" "Obstacles won't stop this diligent little army" What's happening here? All the kids are in hyper mode! Many things will happen here. You don't have to worry about that. Khadija! Hi! Jennifer, my husband Habib. - Are you going to the party tonight? - Yeah. - Perfect. Okay bye. - Okay. You see Burj Khalifa? Yeah, I've seen it many times. So many times? My father... not car. What? Mom! Was it Dilu? Dilu! It's alright. They are children, right? Don't worry, Jennifer. Nothing serious. He is okay now. Take... take rest for one week. Is that so? Then it's fine. You will be alright in one week. It's time! "There's a swing on the branch of new dreams" "Don't you want to reach for the skies?" "Climbing on the wings of a chirping dove" - So you know how to dance? - I do! Oye! Momo! You guys are dancing here without taking me to Burj Khalifa? Come on! Catch him! Come here, you! We're going to see Burj Khalifa tomorrow! Hello guys! Kochu and Ramani teacher! So, we are going to see Burj Khalifa, guys! We heard that it's far away from here. But it's okay, guys! Look, Dilu is sitting here with a sad face. He is very happy. But even then, he is not showing it outside. He thinks he is a big shot. You know what we should do to you? Dilu is angry because he is not getting the phone, guys. You have been making noise for a long time now. - Give it. - You should delete it. - Keep quiet, Momo. - Give it! - I won't give it, Momo! - Dilu! Hey! Stop fighting! If the cops here catch you, it won't be like how it is back home. Your fights! They will teach you a lesson! Mom, Here, the cops will catch you if you treat kids badly! If the cops here catch you, it won't be like how it is back home! Oops! Mom got owned, guys! Who's hitting me? Check who's calling. It's from your office. Don't speak for a minute.. - Let's play. - Okay. Hello, Sir. - Hold this. - Is this what you play? I will keep it there. What happened, Sir? - 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3. Okay, okay. Come fast, come fast Wagging your tail... Wagging your tail... a lot. a lot. Listen, won't you guys stand by me when I have an emergency? - Will Momo stand by me? - Yes. Yes. Rest of you will also stand by me, right? - Hmm. Yes. - Yes. I have to go to the new site for some urgent work. - Let's go quickly and come. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Great! So, we will be at the work site for five minutes. After that, we will go straight to... - Burj Khalifa! - Yes! I'll be back soon. - Just five minutes. - Come back quickly, Muthutty. - I will come quickly. - Come quickly. Okay? Will we reach there if we go now, Mom? Momo! Muthutty! Let's go next Friday. Okay? Momo! I shouldn't have gone live. That was the biggest mistake! It was a big fail! I know, you must be laughing at me. Now you understood... that humans have a lot of worries, right? So, don't go and bite them for nothing! If you ask me what's going to happen next, since it is my case, we can't say anything! Since you have wandered away from the herd, you don't have anything else to do, right? So, if you want to find out, you can come along with me. Hey Momo. It's been so many days since you left! Where is your Burj Khalifa? Everyone here is saying that... you've gone to your Aunty's house in Vattappara. Hello. Khadija, what's news over there? Please don't be upset with me. The kids take the phone and play with it. This phone is always with them! I told them that... one cannot see Burj Khalifa just because they've gone to Dubai... and that not everyone will have that capacity. Will these kids understand this? Okay then. If you have something to tell me, you can say it to my face, Khadija. Why are you beating around the bush? It's not like you don't know my situation, right? Don't I always tell things to your face? Well, while listening to a message, won't it be bad if I stop it when I see you? Isn't it? - Peace be unto you. - And unto you be peace, Habib. - Sit, sit. - Thank you, Sir. How was your training? It was nice, Sir. Thanks for the support. - Your family and kids? - They are fine. Thanks. So, Habib, I want to tell you something. I'm planning to go to my home for vacation. So, I was thinking, maybe... you can shift your family to my home. What do you think? Any problem, Habib? Don't worry. Already, I paid the rent. - How magnificent, right? - Yes. Wow! - See this. - It's not a TV. It's a theater. - Yes. - It's great, right? Wonder what these are! I can't understand a thing. - What's this? - It's touch-enabled. What's that, Mom? This is... something, my dear. Look at this fridge, Shanamol. Oh God! How's this possible? Yes! Now I am relieved. Until now, I had no guarantee that I could show you Burj Khalifa. Now, I have some hope. We must see Burj Khalifa. Okay? Look at this, Shana, Dilu! Smile, Shana. Okay. Okay. You can go and sit now. Dear Kochu, I have sent you some photos. Burj Khalifa's photo will follow. Then we will see how it goes. Okay? How can this guy jump into a swimming pool when he is even afraid to jump into a pond? Hey Kochu, I know that you saw the photos. Why are you silent? What happened? Good morning, guys! Do you see our Mom sitting bored here? This is the bicycle at our house. - Do you see Dilu and Shana cycling? - Dilu! - Yes. - Get inside. I can't sit in the sun. This is our security guard. Security! Security! I'm holding it. Just ride it. - Yes. This is our Arab neighbour. - Momo! - Hey! - Momo! - Come here. - Momo! Come here. Why photo? Why did you take photo without permission? Why? Come on. Delete it. - Delete. - Okay. Do it. - No permission, no photo. - Okay. Poor guy! He got an earful! He's lucky that I don't know Arabic! But he spoke in English, right? I don't know English either, right? Poor guy! Let's go. Eat it. Step aside. Hello Habib. - How are you? - It's "Who are you?"! Okay then. Who are you? Hussain. I'm Habib's Uncle. Habib's Uncle. - Oh, it's Uncle! - Yes, my children! Uncle is here, Mom! - How do I open this gate? - I will open it for you. Yes. You stand in front of the gate, fold your hands like this and say... Abracadabra! Open sesame! Say it! Abracadabra! Open sesame! - It opened, right? - Yes, it's opening. Uncle! Now, turn around, fold your hands and... You rascal! Are you playing games with me? Did you like the toys? - Yes. - You won't get these back home. We get these back home. Those won't have such good quality. Yeah, right! Come here. - What? - Come here! - You too! - What? What's this? There's nothing in there. It's just my clothes. What are you doing, my children? Uncle brought these for you, out of love. So you can show a little joy on your faces, right? - Joy! - What? Joy from seeing this frog? What's wrong with that? Okay. We will show it. Come, Shanamol. Uncle and his rabbit! Here comes the wonderful green frog! Look, Shanamol! My frog's eyes are lighting up! - Oh, wow! - Wow! Careful! You will hit your head! Oh, I'm fed up of these kids! Hopping rabbit! Croak croak frog! What's with this ruckus, kids? Stop making noise! Go somewhere else and play. Stop! Why are you buying them these things to make them happy, Uncle? They have grown up, right? Why do you have to do this? Wasting money unnecessarily! They should enjoy their childhood to the core. They should not have any difficulty. They should play and enjoy like this in their world. Had I known that you like these so much... There were camels and rabbits over there. - I would have bought those as well. - Mom! He is kidding! Do you want less sugar or more sugar in your juice? Not more and not less. Just moderate. Moderate? Like in moderate drinking? Oh God! That is boozing! This is moderate, as in average. Go and bring your slate and pencil. I will teach you. It must be Muthutty. - Peace be unto you. - And unto you be peace. - Is Uncle inside? - Yes, he is. Aunty called me. Did she call you? No. Why? Aunty has a doubt whether he has the necessary documents to be here. Now that he is here, Aunty will create an issue if we don't ask him about it. You can just ask him, right? If we ask him anything, he answers something else! - That's right. - Well, listen. - I have an idea. - Okay. You should play along with me. - Okay? - Okay. Peace be unto you, Uncle. And unto you be peace. How are you, Boss? - Go, freshen up and come. - Okay. What did you give him? - Should I bring something? - He just arrived. I will take care of it. Uncle will go first. Here... Mobile. Hair slide. Phone, from my side. I'll keep a crayon. Not on your eyes. Keep it there. What next? Next, we should put whatever we have with us. The one who has things to keep until the end, wins. - What a boring game! - True. You and your family will lose to me in this game, Habib. Because you won't have as many things as I have with me. Even though it's a game, you should have given us some time to prepare. Right? Be it in a game or in life, I don't like to be prepared. Did you keep something, Momo? Yes. Here's the key to my house. I'll keep my keys too. I am going to... keep my watch. Then, I will keep... my watch. Momo. What are these things? Momo is keeping garbage! - You naughty boy! - From where did you get this? - I didn't get it. It's from what I ate. - Toothpick. Why are you carrying a toothpick around? We can't say when it will come in handy. I needed it now, right? Didn't you see? Shanamol has no plans to quit. Shanamol is breaking her necklace, Mom! Then, I'll keep my wallet. I'll keep... my bangle. Finally, I'll keep... M&Ms? Do you have anything left, Dilu? Keep something, Momo. What is it? A bottle cap? Here. Do you see this? It's an old 25 paise coin from our country. This was all I had when I came here 27 years ago. Even if I have to leave penniless from this country, this is my sole strength. - This one? - I'm keeping this. I quit. I don't have anything. This is my last one. - I've lost too! - Mom has lost too! Your Dad and Mom lost. I'll remove my trouser and keep it, Mom! - Yeah, do it! - Pull up your trouser! Naughty fellow! Don't you have any shame? Then I will lose, right? What's the problem if you lose? Look at your face! Well, Uncle will lose if you put your pearls one by one. Don't quit, Uncle. Now this is all that is left with Uncle. I carry this wallet around only to keep this safe. Well, if I fall down somewhere while I'm running around, it should not be difficult to recognize me, right? I'm keeping that too. I'm not done yet. Look. This wallet is all I have now. Uncle has lost! Here you go! Yaay! - Don't worry. We played well, right? - Shanamol won. - What is it? - Nothing, Uncle. What happened to you two? Shanamol won! Okay then. I'll serve the food. I could have won if I wanted to. I had many more things to keep in today's game. Do you know why I didn't take them out? I did it so that our children wouldn't lose the game. You're bluffing! Uncle is saying that he had more items. Don't bluff, Uncle! See this, loser! Did I take this out? - Driving license and Emirates ID. See? - Let me see the Emirates ID. - Does he have it? - Yes. What is it? Haven't you seen an Emirates ID before? Looking at you, I have a doubt whether you have an Emirates ID. Dear Khadija, seeing this guy's pompous house, I smell something fishy. - Well, Uncle... - Yes. Why can't you stop all this and return home? - That's true. - Aunty and the kids are alone there. Poor Aunty and kids, right? I will return. I have to return. When I return next, that will be my last trip. That's why I'm delaying it. What will I do if I come back here at this old age? - You kids... Hey! - Yes. Change their Visiting Visa to Family Visa. Sure, Uncle. If God wills it! Don't you also need an Emirates ID, right? Yes. I've thought of a plan. What? - Muthutty. - Yes. I dressed the hand of that Filipino kid once, right? And he asked me whether I'm a doctor! Oh, you played your Dad's card here, right? What's wrong in that? It's part of my family lineage, right? That's true. If I do a certificate course, won't I get a job here? It's a good decision. Yes. It's a good decision, but... It's just that my income is a bit less now. I am trying to increase it gradually. That's a good decision. Increasing the income! For the last 27 years, I've been trying to increase my income. Don't say foolish things! - It's not that, Uncle. - Then? It's just a matter of time for me to fly high. When I fly high, won't they be under my wings? Oh, I understand. I just need a support for that. - Okay. - Hey Muthutty. You fly with those wings. I'm talking about my own wings, right? Oh! Here you go. - Shall I leave? - Okay. I didn't tell the children. They will be sad if I tell them. Let them sleep. - I'll call Habib. - Okay. Even though it was a single day, I enjoyed a lot along with the children. This is the first time I'm staying in such a huge house. His friend who gave you this house to stay, is a gem! - Okay then. I'm leaving. - Okay. - Well, dear... - Yes. The children said that you all are going to see Burj Khalifa. If possible, take me along with you when you go. Of course, Uncle. I haven't seen Burj Khalifa very close. I've seen it from a distance... when they take us to the work site in the bus. From really far away. Okay then. Peace be unto you. And unto you be peace. Okay then. Today, Muthutty is going for his exam. Now there is only one Friday left for us to visit Burj Khalifa. Do well, Muthutty. I'll do well. It will be superb. Shall I leave? Here's your bag. - Where is he? - He must be around here somewhere. Find him. It's not like our country. Okay? - Okay then. Bye. - All the best! Burj Khalifa! Khalifa! Khalifa! Burj Khalifa! Khalifa! Burj Khalifa! Which direction is Burj Khalifa, Bhai? Burj Khalifa? - Yes. Burj Khalifa. - You mean the one in Dubai? - Burj Khalifa in Dubai? - Yes. Dubai, Dubai. - On this? You will go on this? - Yes. - On this bicycle? - Yes. - Are you from Kerala? - Yes. Get lost! Quick! Go home! Burj Khalifa! If you don't know the way, you can just say so,Right? Hello. Hi Hello, How are you..Good? Dubai? I'm not going to Dubai today. Dubai? I have an invitation to the scuba club. Next time, God willing. Yes. Peace be unto you! Peace be unto you! Oh God! I forgot it! Momo! Momo! He isn't here, Mom! - His bicycle is here. - Oh God! You see my little brother? Momo! Momo! What happened? Is everything okay? My brother is missing. - Your son? - My son. Yeah, I saw him actually. He was here on his bicycle. When? You saw him? Yeah, I was around this area. I saw him. Oh my God! My child! In the name of God! Oh God! What are you doing here? How did you get in the car? Oh God! What are you doing in the car? I am getting late now. Your house is in Ruwais. It's far away and we are here. Oh God! Whom can I call? Hello Ma'am. Excuse me, Ma'am. Don't worry. We found him. Yeah. You know Mr. Abdullah, your neighbour? He just called me. Your son is with him. Yeah. So you don't have to worry. I know Mr.Abdullah. He is a good person. And he will bring him back to you by evening. Thank you! - Okay. Alright. So no worries. - Thank you so much! - Okay. - See? I told you, right? Let him come. I will show him! Come. What? I want to pee. - What? - I want to pee. What? Toilet? Yes. Okay. Oh God! Today I will get late. One minute. Okay? Where did he disappear? He will put me in trouble. Ah! You are here? Get down. Wash, wash. Come on! Wash, wash. Okay? Good boy! Go there! [speaking in Arabic] Hello, Omar. Yes, yes. It's late. I will reach quickly. Do you want food? Food, food. Okay.

[speaking in Arabic] Momo! - We are sorry, Sir. - No. Momo is a wonderful boy. We enjoyed together. [speaking in Arabic] - Good bye, Madam. - Peace be unto you. He did all this because of me. And I'm not able to do anything. The kids have realized that we won't be able to do it. Dilu and Shanamol are not asking us anything, right? He's just a small kid, right? I have to take him there. I will take him there. If God wills it! Bhai, yesterday's bread was really bad. - Hussain Bhai! - I won't pay for it. - Okay? - What is this? - Hello. - Hello, Hussain Uncle. This is Momo. Yes, Momo. Tell me. Do you have a purple shirt? Oh my God! Purple? Yes, purple colored shirt. Green, red, yellow. I have a blue shirt too. Then wear that and come. Do you have a sunglasses, Hussain Uncle? Well, I have sunglasses. But it's a black pair. Then you get ready for one thing. Well, what is it for? We are going to see Burj Khalifa. - Where? - We are going to see Burj Khalifa! Where? Tell me once again. - We are going to see Burj Khalifa! - Lower your voice. Okay, okay. Hey Bhai! What is it, Bhai? What happened? - I'm going up! - What? Has he gone crazy? - Burj Khalifa! - Has he gone mad? Burj Khalifa! Shanamol, Mom! Come quickly! "Come, as birds" "Through these desert paths" Come fast!

Look over there! A tall building! [And a huge traffic congestion has happened due to that] [So, people going in the direction of Dubai Mall, should take the exit after Mall of the Emirates] Son, look at me. Son! - Look at that metro station. - Don't sleep off today, Momo. Okay. We are going to see Burj Khalifa. Will Momo sleep without seeing Burj Khalifa? [That's the easier way to reach Dubai Mall now] Can we take another route like they said? - How can we turn back in this traffic? - That's true. - Well, we will reach there. - Yes, we will. I hope the water fountain hasn't started. It's like a conference for vehicles, right? It's a heavy traffic block, right? - It's moving. - Vehicles are moving now. Get out quickly! Quick! We're running late. Momo! Momo! Left... no, right... - There, there! - Left! Hussain Uncle! Not that way! This way! Oh God! I'm coming! - He will come. Run! - Come quickly! Left, left! Momo!

Wake up, Momo! - I don't think he will wake up. - Momo! Hey, wake up! I'll hold him. Momo! He won't wake up now. Go on. Go on, Dilu. Hey, don't just stand here. Come with me and see it. - Do you see it? - Momo is not waking up. - Did we come so far for this? - No need. - Shanamol! - No. - Dilu! - I don't want to see it, Muthutty. - Shall we leave then? - Let's leave. - Shana. - Yes. If I fall asleep, you should show Burj Khalifa to my ant. Okay? I had promised him. Okay then. Okay. What is it? What is it, Momo? Shanamol. Don't be sad. Okay? Dilu. Peace be unto you. Come. Ancient and modern shelters. Early man lived in jungles. So, what about the people now? - In houses! - Very good. - Did you understand, Mohammed? - Yes. Okay.

So everyone should assemble and walk in a line... to the auditorium upstairs without talking to each other. Okay? Go on. Don't make noise. Everyone fold their hands on the back and walk in line. Dear teachers, friends and students. We are very proud and happy today. Because our school has become world-famous today. We have assembled here today to share that joy with you.
