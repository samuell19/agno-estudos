Go to sleep, my little genius. So... Thank God for this wonderful day. I tried to be nice to my parents and my friends, and I hope that I've misbehaved. I promise to devote myself tomorrow. Well done. Our Father in Heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as in Heaven Give us today our daily bread And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our creditors ... sorry ... our debtors. No, it's okay. - Amen. You made fun with your friends? - Yes. We even talked about politics. About politics? Really? - Yes really. We agree. It is good that Austria and Germany closer together. We must fight for our purity. Purity? Just saying ... Christian countries only real Germans and Austrians true. I do not understand politics. I understand everything! I can explain it if you want. Maybe another time. Now I want you especially to play with Dolph. Your brother is alone and bored. Wash your back with your friends? - Yes. I stayed here. Only. You have a skin disease, you are not disabled. You have to go outside. - And what will happen then? Did you tell your friends? Did you tell them that you have a big brother? You are ashamed to me, you hate me. You are a Christian but you're not generous. That is not true! So you love me. Yes. - Come give me a kiss! All kits, children? Does it still bother you? Be nice to your brother. All right? Okay. So? That kiss? Well ... children, I must tell you something. Next week we get married in church. Why? - How do you mean? Were not you married? Yes but... only the mayor, not the church. Why? As we previously did not think it was. That's all. Now it is different. - Why? It's enough like this! I'm not asking you to understand. We just wanted you to know. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses As we forgive our debtors And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil. Amen. I would like you to do more difficulty with Dolph. It makes me sad that your father should always punish for it. I do not like him. Dolph is ... - I do not like him ... I mean daddy. Do not say that! What does the stern look on the soft face of my son? Why are you not married in church? It's a long, uninteresting story. You should be happy about this marriage. Happy? Why? How many children have to be lucky at the marriage of their parents? Sweet Dreams! That whole story about the children cross. - Yes I know. We had twelve years ago to marry in church. You know that I'm a heavy church is stepping in. Yet you should. - Not without regret, believe me. Do you regret marrying me? No of course not. That's not it. I know. I know. All that hatred against Jews scares me. Do not worry. When we married, we'll both be good Catholics. It will not go to who is Jewish and who is not. I hope so. I hope so. You wanted to see me as dad ... I need help with my tie. Exactly if you do not feel at ease. Is that because of me? Does not matter to me. Really? Does not matter you ... What you get in your head? Does not matter to me, because I will always be better than you, smarter and more popular. Even the best doctors that will not change! I'll tell Daddy. - Go say! I understand why you and dad are such friends. You look so good on him! You knew he was a Jew, right? - That is not true! That's true! And that's why you look like a Jew. You're just like him. A Jew! - Liar! Now he is a true Catholic, there is no reason to keep you here. Anton, you want to take your wife Paula, for better or for worse? Yes I want that. Paula, you want Anton to take your husband, for better or for worse? Yes I want that. I declare to you, in the sight of God, man and wife. You had a corpse face during prayer service. What's wrong? I know why you're married. - Oh yeah? Yes. You're ashamed of what you are. - Ashamed? I? Yes ... otherwise you would have told us that you are a Jew. Why do you think I am a Jew? This marriage, the fact that you never go to church, you're angry as mom talks about Jesus. I'm not a Jew, it's your mother who is Jewish. That is not true. I've agreed to this marriage only to protect her from people who think this country must be clean, with only genuine and good Christians. Is not that right? It's not true. Here. Do not worry, he'll be back. - He's ten, and it was about midnight. He has character. Where were you? Why did you lie to us? Why did you hide the fact that you're Jewish? You think I'm ashamed to you? I wanted to protect you. I'm not ashamed. I will not be ashamed. I do not care that you're Jewish. Does not matter to me. Come on. Let us warm inside.

Yes, by heaven! Allerverderfelijkste O woman! O rabble, rabble, cursed, smiling rabble! It's good that I write on my tablets. That one may smile, and smile his thugs.

And he'll soon be asleep. The fever has dropped. You can stop now. - She is not cured. Your son has character. It's enough like this! - You promised me. My mother died a year later ... I've always felt that I hope she had for me, I embarrassed. The big man in the middle, you can bend a little? A little bit more... No, this is not. Sit on the couch next to your classmates.
