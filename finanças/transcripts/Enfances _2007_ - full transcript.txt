Go to sleep, my little genius. So... Thank God for this wonderful day. I tried to be nice to my parents and my friends, and I hope that I've misbehaved. I promise to devote myself tomorrow. Well done. Our Father in Heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as in Heaven Give us today our daily bread And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our creditors ... sorry ... our debtors. No, it's okay. - Amen. You made fun with your friends? - Yes. We even talked about politics. About politics? Really? - Yes really. We agree. It is good that Austria and Germany closer together. We must fight for our purity. Purity? Just saying ... Christian countries only real Germans and Austrians true. I do not understand politics. I understand everything! I can explain it if you want. Maybe another time. Now I want you especially to play with Dolph. Your brother is alone and bored. Wash your back with your friends? - Yes. I stayed here. Only. You have a skin disease, you are not disabled. You have to go outside. - And what will happen then? Did you tell your friends? Did you tell them that you have a big brother? You are ashamed to me, you hate me. You are a Christian but you're not generous. That is not true! So you love me. Yes. - Come give me a kiss! All kits, children? Does it still bother you? Be nice to your brother. All right? Okay. So? That kiss? Well ... children, I must tell you something. Next week we get married in church. Why? - How do you mean? Were not you married? Yes but... only the mayor, not the church. Why? As we previously did not think it was. That's all. Now it is different. - Why? It's enough like this! I'm not asking you to understand. We just wanted you to know. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses As we forgive our debtors And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil. Amen. I would like you to do more difficulty with Dolph. It makes me sad that your father should always punish for it. I do not like him. Dolph is ... - I do not like him ... I mean daddy. Do not say that! What does the stern look on the soft face of my son? Why are you not married in church? It's a long, uninteresting story. You should be happy about this marriage. Happy? Why? How many children have to be lucky at the marriage of their parents? Sweet Dreams! That whole story about the children cross. - Yes I know. We had twelve years ago to marry in church. You know that I'm a heavy church is stepping in. Yet you should. - Not without regret, believe me. Do you regret marrying me? No of course not. That's not it. I know. I know. All that hatred against Jews scares me. Do not worry. When we married, we'll both be good Catholics. It will not go to who is Jewish and who is not. I hope so. I hope so. You wanted to see me as dad ... I need help with my tie. Exactly if you do not feel at ease. Is that because of me? Does not matter to me. Really? Does not matter you ... What you get in your head? Does not matter to me, because I will always be better than you, smarter and more popular. Even the best doctors that will not change! I'll tell Daddy. - Go say! I understand why you and dad are such friends. You look so good on him! You knew he was a Jew, right? - That is not true! That's true! And that's why you look like a Jew. You're just like him. A Jew! - Liar! Now he is a true Catholic, there is no reason to keep you here. Anton, you want to take your wife Paula, for better or for worse? Yes I want that. Paula, you want Anton to take your husband, for better or for worse? Yes I want that. I declare to you, in the sight of God, man and wife. You had a corpse face during prayer service. What's wrong? I know why you're married. - Oh yeah? Yes. You're ashamed of what you are. - Ashamed? I? Yes ... otherwise you would have told us that you are a Jew. Why do you think I am a Jew? This marriage, the fact that you never go to church, you're angry as mom talks about Jesus. I'm not a Jew, it's your mother who is Jewish. That is not true. I've agreed to this marriage only to protect her from people who think this country must be clean, with only genuine and good Christians. Is not that right? It's not true. Here. Do not worry, he'll be back. - He's ten, and it was about midnight. He has character. Where were you? Why did you lie to us? Why did you hide the fact that you're Jewish? You think I'm ashamed to you? I wanted to protect you. I'm not ashamed. I will not be ashamed. I do not care that you're Jewish. Does not matter to me. Come on. Let us warm inside. I kept a lot of my mother ... and that's my only memory of my childhood. If you want to come, it must be now. I'll help you get dressed. Give me your foot. O all the armies of heaven! O earth! What else? I must add that hell? Oh, for shame! Hold, hold my heart. And you, my nerves do not get old gallop. But support me rigid. You remember! My poor mind, while my memory is one you love in this world gone mad. You remember! Yes, the tablets of my memory I will erase all stupid and banal notes. All expressions, impressions of the past, have written to youth and observation. And only will survive your command in the book and volume of my brains. Unmixed with laaghartiger topics. Yes, by heaven! Allerverderfelijkste O woman! O rabble, rabble, cursed, smiling rabble! It's good that I write on my tablets. That one may smile, and smile his thugs. At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark. Now my motto: "Goodbye, goodbye Remember me". I have sworn it. I know a new magic trick. Show me! - No, you seem rushed ... You can not concentrate. - Please! No do not bother. All right then. Look! A coin. I have it in my hand. Here it is! Blow. Again! Path. Behind your ear. Here it is! Tell me how you do that! - Never reveal the secret. How did you do it? It's the way you look. The look is the secret of the magician. That's what it's about. Now go. Have you thought about the boarding school? Yes, dear, but honestly, I do not think it's a good idea. This boy is alive, intelligent, independent and very sensitive. And you know, boarding school ... I'm afraid he reacts badly. The adjustment will be difficult ... Bronchitis, pneumonia. Temperature 40 Â° C. If she takes the medicine, everything will be okay. How is she doing? In two days we will know more. Thank you for coming. Good morning. Come on, time for a bath. - Yes. Excuse me? - I do not move. Come on. No. Because if I stop looking at her, she will die. Why do you say that? When I look at her, she will live. It's enough like this! Come on. No, let him. - If not. If he is tired, he goes to bed. Promise you I can stay here as long as I want? Promised. If you stayed awake all night? No, it could not. I slept a few hours. But he continued to look after her. Did not move. You seem proud of him. No, that's not it. But if he can not do what he wants, and his mother dies ... he blames himself that he has not tried. Yet it does not hear that a child does not sleep. Do not worry, there is a god for children. And he'll soon be asleep. The fever has dropped. You can stop now. - She is not cured. Your son has character. It's enough like this! - You promised me. My mother died a year later ... I've always felt that I hope she had for me, I embarrassed. The big man in the middle, you can bend a little? A little bit more... No, this is not. Sit on the couch next to your classmates. The little blonde at the end of the bench, backward please. Back row, closer together. No, it's not better. What should I do now? There is no symmetry. The rules of the art are not respected. Lucie? Stop looking at the boys! Help me or go back to the lodge. look at me ... Let's try ... maybe squatting Come on, man. There, a little lower ... Very good. Have a look... I can not believe it! Do not move, I have a better idea. Come here, boy. So you're just the teacher. So I have a nice symmetry. - Do you listen! That is impossible! A chair is in front of the teacher. Agreed, but please do not speak English to them. Impossible. I can not, it is a learning method. Well, so upright, young man. So ... where were we? Please do not move. holding the pose ... Hey, you there? Are you there? Finally! Now we can take the picture! Continue, so it is quite good. Those who stand up straight, please make a bit of space. Give him a place. Still a bit forward. So, very good. A little to the right ... Now, do not move! Attention please! Looking into the camera, stand up straight ... In... The best students are best equipped for modern living. I would like to protect all others. Come on, Mommy ... - Yeah, I'll ... Caution! No running in the house! Go play outside. The weather is nice. Go inside. Hey girl! I'm not a girl! - Not really? Why did you girl hair? Who goes there? Are you the bourgeois? - And you? Godefer. Surely you're not a girl? Nice shoes. You've lost something ... My boat! It's just a toy. Go, your mom is calling you! - She's not my mom. Not really? Who are they? Where are you? Time to come home. Not bad at all! I was right, you are a bourgeois! ... Is not against religion, he gives her the place she deserves, in the family. And a final separation of church and state is inevitable. Even if Europe is it? Over two centuries, they will thank us for such a law. What are you doing here? - I can not sleep. It's getting late! Go back to bed before your mother sees you. Come on. Gabrielle? - And. What does "bourgeois"? Bourgeois? It means that we live in the city. Godefer? Godefer? Godefer? What do you want, girl? - We can play together. Together? You and me? - Well. In those clothes! - Does not matter to me! You know the forest? - No. How could we play together? - Teach me! And what do I win it? - A friend. I do not need friends. What do you want? Those shoes ... yesterday. All right. - High five. Follow me. - Where are we going? Hurry! But where are we going? Well ... stay here ... Do not move, I'll be back. Well, jump. Come, sit down. You're lucky you have a real boat. - I know. Where do you live? - In a house in the woods ... Yonder. Do you live with your parents? - No ... Only my father. Oh yeah? Why? Let's go, do not bite here. I know a place. We do not come back empty-handed. What are you doing? - Quiet! Come and follow me. You catch the chickens, I take the eggs. Caught? Do not do that! Come here ... Wait ... Caution! I need two seconds. What are you doing over there? If I catch you! What are you waiting for? Do not go there. Run! Petty thieves! - Fast! Schorremorrie! You're disgusting! Disgusting! Sit up straight. Where have you been? Head up. What have you done? Nothing. Give me your arm. Now your feet. To be a good poacher, you must know the animals' habits, where they drink and eat. Do you understand? Look here. A pellet. Towards. Come on. Look. Do you want some? Thanks. Are not you going to school? Are you crazy? I value my freedom. Want some more? - No thanks. Can you read and write? What? I can count ... That's enough. For you. Thanks. I'm afraid they are too small for you. - Do not worry about it. Why do you want them? - You're too young to understand. Here. For you. Are you sure? You'll need it. It's okay, I steal another one. Come, I'll show you something. ... Come follow me. Are you OK? Stay there, I'll come. Give me your hand. Careful with this, it is fragile. Put your hand here. Good. We are almost there. Come on! You see her? What? Over there. The daughter of the cobbler. Is not she beautiful? Hurry up. Forward! - Let me go! I said: I have done nothing wrong. - We'll see. You are hurting me! Excuse us. - No problem. What is it? Do you know these shoes? I bought them for my son. Why? - The villain says he has received them. He knows everything about pilferage ... - No, I have not given him. I thought so. I assure you that he is punished. Let's go to your father. I've given him. - What? Really? - Yes. Then it's just a misunderstanding. My son has given you. They are yours. If you change your mind ... Sorry. Not necessary. Have a nice day! Why he did not take them? I think he was ashamed. Good morning. - Tomorrow. Seeking Godefer. - He's not here. I'm sorry what he did. You will not hear from him. He will not bother you. Godefer! Godefer! Jean, where are you? I know we should welcome him and not cast, the stranger who brings his knowledge and skill. Make thick my blood. Disabling the road and access to the turmoil. No scruples, no inspiration from nature, may disturb my cruel plan. My wife breasts. And take my milk for gall, murderous servants. Wherever you are, in your invisible substances, waiting for the calamity of nature! Kom, dense night. My sharp knife may not see the wound that is causing it. To call out "Halt, halt!" Miss Terry, an admirer! Good evening. I have your autograph, please? Come here. You are already coming to see me? Yes, in Hamlet. You played the role of Ophelia. Thank you. Gluttony. Yesterday, during the break, I was craving chocolate cake. Anger. I got it on the hips of a school friend who was laughing at me. And I also cursed ... What exactly? Shitpile! I told you what happens blasphemers. Yes, they're stupid. Curse no longer. And if you do it right, I'll cut your tongue off. Okay mom. - What else? That's all. Are you sure? - Yes mom. I'm sure. All right then. You can get up again. Mama ... we gonna watch tonight Twelfth Night? Probably. - Thank you mom. Mama... How do we go to the theater tonight? Eight o'clock. I'm not sure whether you deserve. Is there anything you forgot to confess? No... Are you sure? Yes, mom. Really? You gonna keep lying long against me? Emma, ââdo not ... - Do not interfere with it. Tell your father what you're doing at night. What does his dirty son. I... I... I make my bed dirty. Stand up... Go get your photo album. You're too hard on him. And you're not working hard enough. He has done nothing wrong. Again, you will not interfere. throw into the fire! - But ... I recommend you those pictures to throw in the fire. Emma! You're in a decent house where lies and meanness can not be tolerated. Your long life you must keep away from vice and perversion. Go to your room. Papa! Pope! Pope! Where are you? My education, so important in a lifetime, and my instincts have definitely penetrated my work. When will he come? - He or she. It could be a girl. But we're all guys. - It means nothing. More likely it's a boy. And? - You have a sister. It is a girl. Oh, no! - It's not my fault. Can not leave her alone? I just wanted to play with her. - Can not you see she's just a baby? But ... when can you? I do not know. Only about two or three years. But you said ... - Listen, it's not the time. Why do they do so? Since the baby is, she likes babies ... but she does not like. - I do not understand. I can explain but you would not understand. You're too young. I do not Margareta. Me neither. It's bad luck. Since she is there, we are always punished, and we can not even to the sea. There is only one remedy: We learned in school that there is a solution to every problem. If the problem is a crying baby, the solution is obvious. We must get rid of her, her moles. Her murder? - No, just get rid of her. A child is not an adult yet. It understands nothing. It does not know what life is. So get rid of her, is like killing a litter of kittens. Of ratten. Rats are harmful. A child screams, cries, eat, stink. That's all. We will be caught. Why? Many accidents can happen to children. You know what? I heard they may even die in their sleep. What are you doing? Who has the coin, it does. I do not do it. You lost. Now you have to do it, or your life is hell. I make all your toys broken, starting with your magic lantern! Can you get me diapers? - I do not feel... Come here. Note that it does not fall. I'll go get them. Come on! Now push! Here Margareta ... I want to play. - No way. You should have done it. I thought the best way to suffocate her. take a pillow and count to a hundred. That should do it. I'm not enjoyed anymore. Are you really sure? - Do not hit me. It's all your fault. It's not my fault. Of course it is. No baby, no hassle. So it's your fault if Mom and Dad are unhappy. Well ... I'll do it. you do not eat? - I'm not hungry. Eat or you will not be big! What is it? Do you hear that? What? - She cries, is not it? I'm sure she's crying. Go look, please. But I'm not finished eating! One two three four five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Quiet... Well done, you got her calmed down. Give her, I'll show you something. Gently. Keep her head right, and place your hand underneath. Very gentle. Do not fall behind her head, put your hand underneath. Very gentle. So. She is beautiful. Yes, very beautiful. When my sister was born, I realized that the privilege of childhood,
