You feel like dying? Hmm? (SPITS) Man, you gotta clean your car. You got spiders in your car. MELVILLE: This is Fred and Amy Taylor getting ready to go to their kid's game when Vic and his crew invade their home, rob them, rape her, make him watch, then they kill him. Yeah, remember Ms. Williams? Yeah, she was on her way to church. Right, so why would they come back? Is he taunting us? No, he's feeding. DONOVAN: And the spider's a good omen. So we gonna do this or what? You ever see a cop with an ass like this? (CHUCKLES) No, no. Uh-uh! (DOOR BUZZING) MAN: No, please, let them go! Do you know what Sunday is? Yeah, I think it's the 17th. It's Mother's Day, man. Okay, it's Mother's Day. What's the matter with Mother's Day? You get along with your mother. Love my mother, just hate Mother's Day. on Mother's Day than any other day of the year. Damn it. It's true. Another robbery in the same mall? Move! Move! I said move. You want me to stab you? I will cut your eyes out, I swear to God! Not now. I will kill you myself. DONOVAN: Man, what are the odds of this? DISPATCHER ON RADIO: All units be advised, 211 in progress, Superstop Liquor. Are there any units in the area? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Do it, Donovan. Suspect, male, black, approximately 5'10", armed with a screwdriver. Control 12K-21, we're on scene in plain clothes on another job. You want a black-and-white responding? Negative. Hold everybody, we got it. Forget it, asshole. Get out of my face. I'll kill you. Out of my way, bitch. MAN ON RADIO: We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day at Dodger Stadium. Colin Jenkins steps in, he's 8 for his last 14 at bat. We're cool. Good work. Jayne Wayne. Taking care of business. So far, so good. Yeah, we'll see. (RATTLING) (LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT PLAYING) Let's go. MELVILLE: Yeah. Okay, they're out of the store, loading up the car. Out on north driveway heading westbound. They're out of my sight. JAYNE: On my way. You still got that piece of crap? Long as I been wearing this, neither of us got killed. Yeah, well, I didn't know we owed our lives to your furry little claw. Yeah, well, we do. Oh! You stink, Garcia. What? Did you piss yourself? (CHUCKLES) I'm method, just like you, baby. Easy, cowgirl, don't get so close. Sorry. It's okay, nerves are good, as long as you stay in control of those puppies, and never forget, Jaynie, when you're on the hunt, always hang back or you will get burned. Got it. Now speed up a little. DONOVAN ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Okay. Headed for the switch car. Let's get in position. Okay, want me to go over it again? I'll take the front, you take the... I got it. You go off me. I got it. Okay. Slow down. Let me out right here. Let's go. VIC: Watch it. Watch it. Watch out. What the... MELVILLE: Police! Let me see your hands! Both of them! (GUNSHOTS) (GROANS) I give up. No, no, no. Come on. Tough guy like you, not like that. Everybody back off. Lower your weapon, Jayne. (CHUCKLES) You badass, huh? Let's see how bad you really are. Bring these down, sweetness. You're the one they call Melville? Anytime, Vic. Go for it. (SIGHS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GROANING) Go, go, go. (LAUGHING) Go! Garcia! You all right? Yeah, we'll find them, boss. Okay? We'll find him and we'll find them and we'll finish them off, all of them. You've got my word. I don't want assassins. You weren't there, boss. They shot him up, they ran over him, they crushed his face. There's tire tracks where his face used to be. I don't want assassins. Then what do you want? I want you to go home. Go home and calm down. Donovan. You want me to go home, have a nice quiet night at the house, huh? Watch TV, get an ice cream, maybe. What do you expect from me, boss? I expect you to be the cop that I know you are. Now, I need you to stay calm and in control. You got me? Yeah. Good night. You all right? (SNIFFLING) I don't know. Truthfully, no. Sometimes your eyes are forced to see more than your soul can take. But you can take it. I know it's not easy being the first woman being a mandate, but you can measure up. I made the right move choosing you. Anybody with you at home? No, I'm alone. If you need to talk, you call me any time. I don't care if it's just a flesh wound, get to a doctor. Vic's brother just got out of Folsom. He was the driver of the van. I thought he'd be with the switch car. He had his brother watching you watch them. Smart. He had a chance to come around behind you, because you gave Vic a chance to shoot it out. Stupid. He wanted to give up. You should've let him. Never, ever do that again. Now Garcia's dead and Vic is gone. He's not gone, he's down there somewhere. Fits his pattern. Last time he was here three days, started off with a small job downtown, went on a rampage in the Valley, topped it off with a Bank of America heist. We got two days. Melville, don't play with him next time. If he wants to give up, take him. If he wants to fight, kill him. I trust you, but this time you went too far. IRA: Who is it? It's Melville. Hey, Ira. Okay. I'm sorry to wake you. I need a favor. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is that... Were you shot? Can you stitch this? What? No. No, I'm a veterinarian. You have to go to a hospital. What's wrong? No, it's nothing. I was gonna get Doc to come and, like, take a look at my cat. He's... He's wheezing real bad. You have a cat? Yeah. Yeah. I'll get my bag. What's your cat's name? It's Fluffy. So, Melville, why won't you go to a hospital? No. Full of sick people. Wow. Got a lot of harpoons. Yeah, my great-grandfather's. Jesus. That one's huge. What is he? Was he a whaler? Yeah, he was a whaler. Moby-Dick. You're named after Herman Melville. (LAUGHS) You're a smart guy, Ira, a smart guy. (SIGHS) I... Yeah. because Melville, I mean, that's a pretty weird name. Can you stitch this up? Ooh. Hope you catch the guy who shot you. Yeah. (CAT WHEEZING) (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (GRUNTING) (WHIMPERS) ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, this is Audrey and Scotty Beckett.

Oh, come on. Record? Yes, he did. This murder is Billy Beckett's record. Gangbangers, drug dealers, they just robbed a restaurant. The owner's a friend of mine. They beat him. They had a right to a trial. Maybe that's why you're sitting there defending that scum of the earth. (GRUNTS) (RADIO CLATTERING) SOPHIE: Your hand is shaking. Don't miss. What are you gonna do? Kill yourself? Do it, and make it a clean shot. Don't make it messy like when you shot me. (DOG WHIMPERING) Don't you ever feed it? He's starving. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Billy Beckett?

It's a simple question. Do you believe in God? Yes or no? I think so. That's good enough. Have a seat. Detective Billy Beckett, one last question. Do you still wanna be a cop? My career is over. Have you heard of SIS? Special Investigation Section? Only the rumors. Which are what? It's a hit squad. SIS was formed in 1965 as a surveillance unit, to go after the worst of the habitual criminals and catch them in the act of committing violent crimes. If we arrest someone for intent, the likelihood of conviction is zero. They make bail, they're back on the street the next day, robbing and killing civilians. But we're off the books. There's no office. Your office is your car. Roll call is wherever you are. You're a smart guy, Billy. You deserve a second shot. I want you to join my squad. I'm not a killer. DONOVAN: Neither are we. (PLAYING BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC) Be at the veterans cemetery tomorrow at 12:00 or forget we ever met. MAN: ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ If you haven't made a decision by now, go home and fish off your pier. Perfect, just perfect. You got a new family now. HELLER: Your Honor, Sophie rode the bus from Eagle Rock to Westwood every weekend to take her ballet lessons. She was a bright kid with a tremendous future ahead of her until she was cold-bloodedly gunned down by Billy Beckett, whom the family is holding personally liable, and I want to proceed to trial immediately. We want justice. I won't let Beckett's lawyer stall. Your Honor, my distinguished colleague has filed 1,100 lawsuits against the LAPD. 1,100? Is that not correct? 1,142. What's your point? I'll ask the questions, if that's all right with you, Mr. Heller? I'm sorry, Your Honor. My point is, Your Honor, at least a third of Mr. Heller's cases are routinely dismissed, as this should be. No, we will proceed. Trial starts July 21st. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you so much. Thank you. We're gonna get this guy. Same thing, went fishing, went home, kept the lights on all night, the guy does not sleep. Well, what does he do all night? I don't know. I don't exactly go look in the window. I don't wanna get shot. I'm not paying you to sit on your ass in the car. Get up there and look in the window. Use this, it's got a built-in video camera. There's the lens, zoom is remote. It's very expensive, okay? State of the art. Do not lose that. (GROANS) What are you doing? I got a bad back. He doesn't go out at all? No, he just talks to his dog. What exactly are you hoping to find, anyways? Something to make him look worse. You really need to make this guy look worse? I mean, he's pretty close to walking away as it is. He better not. I'm paying you twice your normal rate, but if he kills himself, I'm not giving you a dime. Help, help! (GRUNTS) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (EXCLAIMING) Oh, please. Oh, please. Don't hurt me. Stop, stop.

It is a big deal, but when it's SIS, it's just not public. PRIEST: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us... (MAYA LAUGHING) MAYA: Oh, my God. Jesus. This is kind of trashy, but it's hot. Baby, you did good, real good. Anything you like? Everything. I know you like everything. Everything. I love it. Yeah? Babe, I love it. I love you. I love you, too. You know I do, right? Yeah. Let's go home and make a baby. (RATTLING) Come on, you'd make a wonderful father. I need one more score. We got enough, Vic. Let's go home. Babe, I have this all worked out. Ten million flawless white diamonds are sitting in a safe. Uncut stones, all worth over 100 grand, all in one safe. This is perfect. We can't pass this up. Baby, with all those diamonds, I'm gonna buy you Costa Rica. (SHOUTING) We got enough to buy all of Costa Rica and the cops. We got enough here, Vic. Don't do this. Just be a good girl and don't get nuts on me. Fine. Let the diamonds blow you. Enough! Shut up and get changed. Yeah? You want me to get changed? Huh? Yeah. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? (GRUNTS) No! What are you gonna do, huh? (MOANS) (MOANING) He's a bad choice. Man's cracked some big cases. Can't take that from him. Let me tell you how I see it. Beckett's either trigger-happy or that girl's shooting was an accident, and if it was an accident, it's gonna make him risk-averse next time he has to drop the hammer or worse. He's gonna shine the spotlight on us and we're out of the shadows for good. Either way you look at it, he's a liability. Billy Beckett, Jayne Skylar, Donovan Rivers, Melville Atkinson. This is SIS. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Armstrong. We'll take it from here. Right now? Did the Chief say why? All right. I'm on my way right now. They found the jeep? Next to a black male's body. In the Valley? Yeah. Same radius as last time. Donovan, you ride with Jayne. Melville, you go with Billy. No can do. Hey, look, I don't wanna hear it. Boss. I don't wanna hear it. Look, I... You stay out of it. Boss, take a look in his eyes. This guy's hinky. He's not right. They said the same thing about you. That was different. I know what you were, and I know who you are. You're partners. Make it work. HELLER ON PHONE: Roz, you there? Roz? Where the hell are you? Speak. Hello? Hey, your boy's at veterans cemetery talking with Lieutenant Armstrong. Guard at the gate said there's a funeral for a Hector Garcia. I worked Wilshire Division with a Hector Garcia. I don't get this. If there was a cop funeral, why aren't there any cops here? Are you sure it's Armstrong? Yeah, positive. Beckett's talking to him right now. I mean, they're with a group, but I don't recognize any of them. You have no idea what you're looking at, do you? Armstrong is Lieutenant of Special Investigations Section. SIS? You mean you've got me... Yeah, yeah. They must be interested in Billy Beckett. (SCOFFS) SIS has a bitch on the team. Who is running LAPD? A dude shoots a girl in cold blood. So what do they do? They promote him to SIS so he can go ahead and shoot more people. Roz, are you getting good footage? Follow them. Get them standing by while an innocent civilian gets hurt. Get their violent and aggressive behavior on tape. That, I will get on the news. Wow. Why do you hate cops so much, huh? Just doing your civic duty, or you get groped by one as a kid? Listen to me, asshole, someone has to do what I do. We can't have uniformed fascists running around our city unchecked. LAPD is rotten to its core. I'm gonna fight with every last drop of blood to get these assassins with badges off the street.

When you're on your own, you learn to cook and clean, and I make a killer turkey casserole. (CHUCKLES) I give Betty Crocker a run for her money any day of the week. Hey, Donovan. Yeah? Melville. What's his deal? I've been in the trenches with him for 10 years. You will never meet a better cop in your life. You a drunk? No, no. Are you? I've never had a drink. Never had a drink? What does that mean? It means I've never had a drink. What? Like never in your life? (LAUGHING) Get out of here. I don't lie. You'll get that if you last. So, Luke. How'd you meet? He flew F-18s, I was a surface warfare officer. So you met in the Navy? We were high-school sweethearts, then one night we saw a movie that changed our lives. Star Wars? Top Gun. Iceman. Maverick. And then? Luke knew he wanted to be a pilot, and I knew Luke was the man I wanted to marry. So, what brought you to law enforcement? (CHUCKLES) Another movie, an oldie starring the coolest dude that ever walked the earth. Let me get this straight, you've never tasted alcohol, you've never smoked a cigarette, you have never tried a drug? That's right. You have never had a sip of wine or a taste of beer? Never. (LAUGHING) You ever been laid? I mean, it's mind-boggling. I don't know how you can't be curious about that stuff. Yeah, well, I'm not. (SOPHIE LAUGHS) I like this guy, 'cause he is psycho. What are you looking at? Why you keep these straws in the car? Your dentist tell you to use these to avoid tooth decay? Put them back. (SIGHS) Now. I bet you don't even have a cavity.

Vic Dago. Jesus. What's his problem? Gabe had a partner. Tommy. Gabe and Tommy are chasing Vic two years ago. Vic follows Tommy when he takes his kid to school, Tommy is walking his kid to his car, Vic does a drive-by, kills Tommy in front of his kid. That's his problem. Gabriel, you all right? You need to be warned. You think you're hunting him. He's hunting you, brother. Beckett is a good cop, honest, trustworthy and ethical.

What did you say? With all due respect, Chief, I'm in charge of the selection process. Let me tell you something, Lieutenant. I'm thinking of getting rid of SIS. I'm thinking of taking your off-the-books operation off the books. You do that, and you'll be doing yourself and this city a great disservice. Crime will skyrocket and you'll be out. Joseph, are you threatening the Chief? Absolutely not. I'm just giving you the truth. Well, let me give you some truth. There isn't another full-time surveillance unit like your SIS in the country. That's because there's no other city like L.A. in the country. L.A. needs SIS. We need it. Every round has to be justified. Every round has to be accounted for. One bad shooting, and you're done, you're finished. SIS will be disbanded, you understand me? Understood. You're hanging on a slender thread. WOMAN: Home address, Detective? Yeah.

(LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT PLAYING ON RATTLE) (TRACKER BEEPING) Vic was on the northeast corner of 8th and South Hill. Hold on, hold on. Guys, it's E.D. Marshall's, the diamond center. Everybody roll. All right, we got an address. Let's go. HELLER ON PHONE: Roz, don't tell me you lost him. How could you be so incompetent? Haven't you ever tailed anybody before? Didn't they teach you that sort of stuff... Never mind. (CARS HONKING) No sign of him anywhere. The coast is clear. It's pretty crowded in there. So? So if this thing goes sideways, people get hurt. Look, if you're thinking about alerting security, you can forget it. We're just gonna stand here on the sidewalk, wait for this thing to go down and do nothing? That's exactly what we're gonna do. I don't want any chance of him getting away. What about the people inside? Don't shoot any. We're putting innocent lives at risk, we gotta do something. You know what, Beckett? Maybe this isn't for you. Go back home, have your dog lick your balls. BECKETT: You want Vic that badly? You don't care if innocent people get killed so long as you get your man. Hey. I've never killed a civilian. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You can't go in there. You could cause a hostage situation. You put more lives at risk by going in. I'm not doing nothing. Hey, hey, Beckett, this isn't your decision. Not his, not hers, it's mine, and here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna wait for Vic to make his move and that's that. You got a beef, go whine at Daddy Armstrong. (SCOFFS) (SIGHS) Hi, welcome. I'm Dorri. Hi. I'm looking for a special engagement ring. Okay, what size? Three to four karats. Three to four karats?
