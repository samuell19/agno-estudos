You're going to pay for this. It's for you. CAR OWNER: Do you know who you're talking to, who you're dealing with here? Listen, mate, I'm gonna have you put away for this. I'm gonna have you put down. CAR OWNER: Do you realize how much that car cost ? CAR OWNER: Twenty-five grand. [BURGLAR ALARM] What do you think? Seen better. I doubt it. So do you know how much a paint job costs on one of those? What do you think? I think you're going to get us into a lot of trouble, Billy. Yeah. [POLICE CAR] Give it some juice, Billy. Oh shit.

Bad man's wagon, sir. It's nice. Nice? It's a BMW 325i, man. Six cylinders, 140 BHP. Standing to sixty in less than seven seconds. That is a class car. Oh well, I know, I know. Switch your alarm off, dirty Kevin. Heard you had a run-in with the busies already. Yeah, we saw some speed. What about you? Been busy. Bit of shopping, you know. Crash and carry. Be Bop? That's the car. Real classic. No shit. When you take the trims off, then with the black body underneath, when you turn the lights out, you're invisible. This place is getting popular. Yeah. Couple of lads are selling tickets to watch her. Hey, do you know about Lenny? No. He hit a concrete post. Did he get hurt? He got fucked. Shit. You are about to witness the strength of the Be Bop. Where's this car? Ah, you're not real. I couldn't resist it. Shut up! Guess who's watching. He's happy to see you back. Fuck him. Tommy's been a big man while you've been away. He's got half the kids here on his crew. [HELICOPTER] The police are on their way. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. The police are... Get out. Fucking bastards. Billy, come on let's go.

When? Why did you go back to the car? Good music's hard to find. You're out of your fucking mind. You got a cigarette? I thought you'd quit. No. I just stopped buying them. Camel. These will kill you. I'll take the chance. How about going home? Pick up my stuff. The old man's been looking after it. Right. Billy. Welcome home. [DOORBELL] SARAH: Who is it? Who're you? I live here. Billy? I'm Sarah. Hello, Sarah. Nice dressing gown. My daddy? No. So can I come in? I'm sorry, Billy. Come on. He'd kill me if he knew. Where's my stuff? He boxed it up. Couple of days ago. It's all in the caravan. He didn't keep nothing. He said he's had enough. He's says you're a thief, Billy. Yeah? And what does he do? He sits on his fat arse and smokes all day. What the fuck does he know? He doesn't wanna see you messed up, Billy. No one does. [DOOR SLAMS] Welcome home. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You think I'm ever going to tan, Billy? You need time. See that? You ever been on a plane, Billy? No. You ever been abroad? No. I been to Durham. What's in Durham? Prison. Talk about Ireland. What do you wanna know? Anything. All right. Back home, what you do, they don't need prison. They just kneecap you. Someone comes round in the middle of the night. Gun to your knees and...bang! I had a friend back there. He was a real local hero. Caught up with him eventually. So? Two days later he was at a hospital, stealing cars with walking sticks. One for the accelerator and one for the clutch. Do you want to know anything else? Yeah. What did he use for the brake? His dick? That's not very funny, Billy. What? He's something special? He means something to you, Jo? Not anymore. [AIRPLANE] There's one car stolen every 60 seconds in this city. Now that's an epidemic and I think it's about time people realized it. INTERVIEWER: What are you doing about it? What I can do. What I'm allowed to do. INTERVIEWER: Do you need more prisons? No, I don't need more prisons. I don't need more police. Certainly don't need more guns. They're never the answer. INTERVIEWER: So what is the answer? I'm just a policeman. CONWAY: Don't ask me. Got you, you fucker. Nice shot. Nice hat, Be Bop. It's on loan. What's that? Is this the best you could do, Jo? What do you mean? 'Crazy Cars'. This is a fucking antique, Jo. Oh well, I've never stolen an antique before. You two want coffee? That stuff is bad for you, Billy. You had a skateboard? Very 80's. Oh, lovely. Who did you see inside? Tig, Rick, Spencer... they're all there. Like a fucking school reunion. Oh man. I remember these. Shut up. You had worse. Shit! Hey, look at this.

Don't worry, Monkey, they don't have guns. Not yet. Booyakasha! Come on, Jack, you old tart. Right you lot. Let's do crime. Shut the fuck up, Pony. Always look for the telegraph poles. They run alongside you. Whenever the road turns, there's another pole. You look up, you see 'em, you know what's coming. If you're gonna take it from a car park, look at the tickets. People are mean. If they buy three hours, they'll be gone three hours. Are you listening? I had a Jag last night. Bullshit man. You couldn't steal a Tonka toy. Shit. Can you do that? Of course. You stole the Porsche, right? You swerve left, you hit the cones, and you smash the police car off the road. Off the road? Got it? Not really. Now bring the noise [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Everyone gets to be on TV. Yeah. King of beers. Prince of piss more like. Now Guinness, there's a drink. I'll come back for that.

JO: You're wasting your time. Yeah? She wasn't your type. Jealous? Just worried you might catch something. Oh yeah. Rabies, perhaps. You are jealous. Not me. Hey, look at that. Wankers. Me and Be Bop started like that. I could never reach the pedals. I used to tie blocks of wood to my shoes to give me a few extra inches. I remember the first time behind the wheel of a car. The thrill of it. I remember the speed. I used to come here as a kid. Used to get a buzz. Ya, ya, very thrilling, Billy. You wanna see something? What? You wanna see something? What is it? Do you want to see something? All right then, show me. Where you going, Billy? Oh don't be stupid. You wanted to see something. Well, not this. Catch. Oh, fuck you. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Billy.

Yeah well, things are always tough, innit , Steve? I'll tell you what. Make it 25, I'll take the lot. No. They're worth 40. I told you. Things are hard. 40, Steve. Or it's not worth my time. Sorry. I'll tell you what though. I'll do you a favor. Thirty. Thirty quid. Top offer. Don't give me that shit, Steve. Listen, man, you're really pissing me off. I'm not going to take it. I'd rather dump the lot in the river than sell 'em for that. Come on, Tommy. What do you mean, "Come on Tommy"? You think I'm joking, do you? You think I'm fucking about? Yeah? 30 quid. 30 quid for this mate? 30 quid. Look at that, look. Bollocks, mate. For 30 fucking quid. STEVE: All right. All right. Come on, man. Take your fucking hands off me, you batty man.

Videos, TVs, hi-fi, cigarettes, you name it. I'm the man. Of course, you are. You don't understand, do you, Jo? You know what it's like. The shopkeepers think we are scum. No one gives you credit. No one rents to you. Not me. I supply. These little people, they can't live without me. Oh please. You should get organized, Jo...Yeah? You want something? Take it. It is fuck or be fucked. A philosopher? Got contacts, you know. I can make you some serious money, girl. I'll think about it. You're wasting your time. You know that, don't you? With Billy. I know him, man, he's a fucking freak. Adrenalin junkie. I get my thrills. Yeah, it won't last. He's not as good as he thinks. Anything can happen in the next half hour. How do you feel? Dilated. Jo, do we have to? I was going to sleep today. All day? Yeah. Why not? There's fuck all else to do. And now I have to watch that shit all day. Stingray. Oprah Winfrey. Sesame Street. Oh, great. I think I've given myself brain damage. I'm surprised you can tell. Shit. You should get a new one. Thank you. Oh, great. What is it? Fashion patrol. Make yourself at home. Couple of stores got hit last night, Billy. I only just got out. You know that. You came to see me off, remember? You have anything to do with it? No. What about these? Presents. You can prove it, can you? I don't have to. Not yet. Look, I know my rights. I watch L.A. Law. Is that supposed to be funny? No. More comedy drama, you know what I mean? He doesn't need your help. Cigarette? I never touch low tar. Look at this rubbish. You even steal trash. Oh, fuck you. What? How long have I known you, Billy? Since you were what... Nine, ten? I don't remember. Why do you do it, Billy? You don't keep anything. You don't have anything. You like being in prison, is that it? Makes you a big man with your mates? No. Why do you do it? One last time. Did you have anything to do with those shops? Yeah. I've got a pile of TV's under the bed. Have a look. Fridge under the table. Microwave... Food mixer. Oi... Oi... Do you want a suit? Polyester.

MONKEY: Ford Granada, latest model. Wankers drive it straight into a wall. Waste of a fucking good car, that is. BE BOP: It was the police that did it, Monkey. But we'll have them back down here. We'll show them not to fuck with us. Yeah. We'll show 'em, eh, Billy? Maybe. Maybe tonight. We're closing up. This used to be a beautiful little shop. What happened? People kept driving cars into it. So we're going to do it? Come on. Look at the place. Maybe if we had guns. No. Anyway, Tommy's doing the Alaska tonight. I thought we might check it out. You're asking for trouble, Billy. What else is there? Look at this place. How do people live in this filth? Hello, Mr. Venning. Very nice of you to make a house call. You have my stuff? Upstairs. I'd watch that motor, if I were you. There's a lot of bloody thieves around here. Did you get a scanner? No sweat. Nice. I'll see you there. You live in this place? Yeah, me and a few others. We're just one big happy family. This place is a disgrace. You did all right out of it. Laurent. This is good. Yeah, I know. So where's the rest? Still in the store. You tell me what you want and I'll get it for you. No fuss, no waste. How much? Eighty, your jacket. I'll do fifty. Man, no deals. See how much it sells for in the shops. Five hundred. You're gonna get one-fifty for them, at least. Doesn't work like that. Come on, son. Fifty quid for the jacket. It's easy money. Fuck. Fucking people, man. Easy money. That's what you make. I take risks. I earn my money. What d'you do for yours? Now I told you. I want eighty. I don't need 'em. Not for that price. You're not the only supplier. I could walk out of that door right now and find a dozen like you. Right there on the street. Yeah? Go on then. They're cowboys. They'll fuck it up. So I'll use another. What does it matter to me? Because I get what you want. Guaranteed. I'm the best. And you know it. All right, boy. We'll have a deal, you and me. Sixty a jacket. Sixty-five. Sixty. Okay. Pony... Pony. Take the man's order. We'll deliver tonight. The Alaska won't know what hit it. Any sign of Tommy?

An emergency is in progress. It's raining. Tobago. There is an emergency in the building. Please evacuate the building. Jo, look at this. Ninety for a kettle. I can't believe people pay that much.

There's busies everywhere. That store was mine, man. Fucking you, that store was mine. What am I going to tell Venning, man. What am I going to tell Venning? Which bastard was it? Word has it, Billy McKenzie. He's led the busies up from the estate. There's a bunch of kids up there and they trashed 'em. He's an 'ero. He's a fucking hero now. Yeah, all right, he's a wanker. Fucking dead, that's what he is. JO: Aren't you forgetting something? BILLY: What? JO: Your kettle. Thank you. Fucking antique. Tires were flat. We just leavin' it? Fuck no. [DOORBELL RINGING] [DOORBELL RINGING] Oh man, look at this. Yeah, wonderful, Monkey. Just like home. [KETTLE WHISTLING] Who says you can't buy happiness? That all depends on where you shop, Billy. Kettle's great. It's an Alessi. Worth every penny. Perhaps you should have got some cups as well. Yeah, maybe next time. Maybe next time you can do without the riot. That place was a fucking nightmare. Fuck. Billy. Fuck. Billy! Billy. Billy. Fuck him. Billy... Where the fuck are you? Fuck him. Think I pissed him off? Where's my van? Where the fuck is my van? Where we going anyway? Place I know. It's not far. I don't know why you and Tommy don't just get a life. See who's got the biggest dick and save us all this trouble. Jesus Christ. How'd you find this place? I used to crash here when the old man used to lock me out. I can see why. Little boys love their train sets. All mod cons. Going to be okay here? Yeah, sure. Safer than some hostel. Cleaner too. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Pigs in space. It's getting too hard, Billy. I like it hard. It's time to move on. Yeah. I fancy... The Bahamas, myself. Maybe Miami. I'm being serious. If they catch you again... They won't. Bullshit. What, you think I wanna go back? You think I wanna go back to prison? No I don't. It scares the shit out of me. Then why don't we just go? Pick up a car and get the fuck out. I can't do that. Why not? Look around you, Billy. You got nothing left here. You got nothing to stay for. What's the point? There's nowhere better than this. How do you know? You haven't seen anything. I can show you places, Billy. Billy. I'm not like you, Jo. Yes you are. You're just like me. This is my home. I've seen a dozen towns like this. I grew up in a town like this and it's nothing special. It is to me. Why? Because you got a reputation? You've got what you want, Billy. You're the best. You're better than Tommy. They all know it. You've got nothing to prove. We could get out. Just you and me. We could get something going. Jo, we've got something going right here. The cars. They aren't enough, Billy. Not for me. Not anymore. I'm 22. I'm an old woman. I stole cars at school. I'd take them over at break. Leave it parked outside the gates. And at the end of the day, I was the only kid to drive home. I was a fucking hero. You know what that felt like? It felt like I was somebody. You're somebody to me. Come on, Jo... This is the 90's. Sex isn't safe anymore. Where you going? To bed. Jo. Jo. Jo. [TRAIN CHUGGING] So how's the cowboy? Camping under the stars? What do you want? I frightened you this morning, didn't I, Jo? A bit. A bit? It costs me, Jo. I don't do this for fun, you know. This is business. Big money business. I don't need more filth on the streets. I don't need the fuckin' headache. It's not my problem, Tommy. It could be. Now you talk to him. You keep your fool under control. You wear all these, do you? They hide the damp. You could do a lot better than this, you know. I've seen your shitehole of a place. You know, I need to be where it's at. Stay close to the talent. I'm not going to be there for ever. You and me, Jo... We don't stay in places like this. We get out. You know it. You just gonna play with that thing, or are you gonna use it? You touch me again and I'll bite your face off. Yeah. I'm sure you would. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [BURGLAR ALARM] [BURGLAR ALARM LOUDER] MONKEY: That place was fucking Fort Knox, man. Tommy whipped the shit out of it. You should have been there, Billy. You should have seen... Monkey, shut up. It's nothing. If he wants to see something, we show him. Right, Jo? I bet she's got one too. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Look at them. The living dead. What the hell are we doing here, Billy? Window shopping. We're gonna show Tommy something. Oh for Christ's sake, will you forget Tommy? Jo, we've got to show him who's best. Bullshit, Billy. You're not a kid any more. Yes, mother. I'm not your fucking mother. Where's Jo? I thought she was with you. What do you think? This place? This is something. This is one big fucker. Might be too big. What do you mean? I mean they've got reinforced glass. They got shutters, they got cameras, they got alarms. Big alarms, Billy. So? So why do it? Because nobody else has. Makes sense. Jo? Jo? Billy? Nice neighborhood. TOMMY: Hello, Billy. TOMMY: Remember this place, do you? What do you want? You've been sniffing around that big mall. What mall, Tommy? No, man. Don't fuck with me. You owe me, remember? Is that right? Yeah. That's right. Every time, man, you played a hero, I paid a price. So? So, if you do that mall, I'm in. I'm not asking you, Billy. Think about it, man. Once you're through them big doors, the place is wide open. No protection. You can't take it all, man. I'm giving you a chance to make it up to me. So don't shit in my face. Come on, Billy, man. Get yourself set up. Earn yourself some money. You're not giving me a choice. There you go. That's the idea. I'll tell you tomorrow, Tommy. As long as you tell me "yes". Pony, take the boy home. I can walk. What do you think? I think he's full of shit. Think he's going to do it tonight? Yeah. Give me a phone. What you doing? If Billy won't share... He's no use to us, is he? I saved you one. You're not coming, are you? There's no point, Billy. Don't go. I mean, fuck, Jo. Fuck. Come on, you and me. I'm out of here, Billy. It's over. So that's it then? You can come with me, you know. We'll get out tonight. And do what? There's more than this town. There's more than you and Tommy and the rest of them. Just forget Tommy. Just let it go. How can I? I can't let him get away with this. Just once more. Something special. Something to show him who's best. Something to remember us by. It's all set, Jo. It's just sitting out there waiting for us. One last hit. Come on. Feel the force. Last time for you? It's gonna be the best. Fucking Holy Grail, I promise. MONKEY: Hey, Billy... Are we late? No way. The shops stay closed for another eight hours. I've got these for the cameras. What about Tommy? He's a wanker. What can I say? I heard you talked. Yeah. He wanted in on tonight. And? I said I'll tell him tomorrow. Nice one. Yeah...let's do it. What do you think? Take some weight, yeah? We'll get the speed. All right. Got it. What do you think? If we're going to do this, Billy, let's do it right. Now, this is more like it. That is one big mother. Yeah. We're the first. Do you think we'll get our faces on TV? Breakfast, daytime, prime time. Yeah, well, I hope they get my best side. You don't have one. All right. Let's saddle up. Do you really think he believed you? Who? Tommy... About tonight. There could be anything down there, you know. Jo. That's the fun of it. When we're in, you take care of the cameras. Don't worry, I'm on it. Michael Jackson, king of pop. What do you think? Always wanted to be black. Dream on, man. Silent running, Billy. Hear anything? Not a whisper. Wicked. Hold on, Monkey, we're about BE BOP: to do some shopping. Now. Jesus. JO: Jesus Christ. Get us out of here, Billy. Fucking bastard. Shit. CONWAY: Let's go. Let's go. All units, I'll meet you on the ground. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Bye bye, Billy. Where are we? Loading bay. Under the stores. Did we lose them? I don't know. Did you see Be Bop and Monkey? I saw them, Billy. Oh shit. I've never seen so many police. Something to remember us by. Isn't that what you said, Billy? You hear anything? No. All right. Hang on. Wait a second. They've found us. Here it comes. You don't have to do it, Billy. We could just get out now. We could just walk away. Just walk away? He's not going to stop. JO: Get out of the fucking way. Yeah. Yes. We got them. Billy. [CLOSING SONG PLAYING]
