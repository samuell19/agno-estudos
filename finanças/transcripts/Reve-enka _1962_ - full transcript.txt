THE STORY OF THE FOX'S WIDOW Please, come in. So there's a new farm maid here this year? 1 don't believe I've seen you here before? Good afternoon, Irenee. I'll be... If it isn't Asbjørnsen, himself, from Christiania. Welcome! You're a rare sight these days. Please, have a seat, and I'll bring you some coffee? Could you fetch some cookies for us, please? - This is my niece, you see, - Such a nice little girl. She tends to the goats and keeps me company. - It's quiet since my husband died. - You haven't thought of re-marrying? I won't be as lucky as the Fox's Widow. As good and kind a man as my late husband is hard to find. "The Fox's Widow"? I haven't heard of her. Yes, I knew it! You'd come for more stories and legends. The Fox's Widow. And all her suitors. It's a story for you too, my child. You'll soon have your own suitors to consider. Once there were a fox and his wife. They lived far away in the forest. They were good friends, and lived happily together. But then one day, the fox had gone to the farmer's chicken coop - - and eaten every last chicken. This made him ill, and so he died. However much his wife grieved and wept, it was to no avail. He was dead. But soon as he was buried and the funeral was over, - - suitors came knocking at the widow's door. The first one was the wolf. A rich and fearsome character in the forest. Along the way, he happened to come across upon an old hag. Don't stand there laughing. Why don't you come to an old woman's aid? How did you manage to get your long snout caught in the tree stump? I was chopping firewood one day, when I got my nose caught in this stump. I've been standing here without no food for a hundred years. Perhaps you'll be so kind as to help me? No, I'm off to ask the Fox's widow to marry me, so I've no time. If you've stood there for a hundred years, - - I'm sure you can endure a hundred years more. Oh, skippety, hop hooray. I feel good today. Oh, dear me! My, aren't you a happy young lad? I'm so happy today, because I've just been married. I'm off to propose to the widow and get married myself. I'm delighted to have met you, because then I can eat you first! Help! The wolf is after me! Help! Oh, help me! Oh, please, spare my life! This is the home of the Fox's Widow. The Fox's Widow? So it is. You do understand that I was never going to hurt you? I thank you for your help, hare. It was kind of you to show me the way. I'm off to ask her to marry me. Good bye for now. Good bye. Please, answer the door, Korse, and see who it is. - Good evening. Is the Fox's Widow in? - Good evening. Yes, she is in. What is her mood, pray tell? She's grieving that her husband's dead. She doesn't know what to do. Ask her to come for a walk, I might have some good advice for her. Who's that thumping and banging? It's one of your suitors. He wants to give you an advice. What colour is his coat? Distinguished grey, in an untrustworthy way. I don't want his advice. She doesn't want your advice. The second suitor was the bear. A strong and powerful character. I see you're standing there sharpening your hooter, for some reason! Don't just stand there grinning. I haven't had a bite of food for a hundred years. So perhaps you'll be so kind as to help me? No. I'm off to ask the Fox's Widow to marry me. If you've stood there for a 100 years, I'm sure you can endure a 100 more. Oh, skippety, hop hooray! I feel good today. Oh, dear me! You're a cheerful chappy aren't you? I'm so happy today, because I've just been married. I'm off to propose to the Fox's Widow and get married. And I'm glad I met you, because then I can eat you! Help! The bear is after me! Help! Oh, spare me please. This is the home of the Fox's Widow. Oh, yes, the Fox's Widow. This is her house. This is where she lives. Now let's get you up on your feet, lad. I hope you didn't hurt yourself when you stumbled and fell? Nice house, the fox house, isn't it? Well, I'm off to ask her to marry me. Thank you very much. N-n-not at all. Go and see who it could be. Afternoon. Is the Fox's Widow at home? Yes, she is. Ask her if she'd like to take a walk. I might have some good advice for her. - Who is knocking on the door? - It's another suitor. He might have some good advice for you. - What colour is his coat? - A beautiful brown. - A big fellow with shifty eyes. - I don't want his advice. She bids you be off. The third one to try his luck was a poor but happy fox. He met the old hag. Your nose is stuck, you poor old dear. No one has called me dear for a hundred years. If you help me, I'll do you a favour in return. I'm off to ask someone to marry me, but I have time to set you free. Oh! Dear me, what a relief! I haven't had a bite to eat for more than hundred years. Will you give me something to eat? If you'll make do with an oatcake and a drop of cream. It's all I've got. Bless you for your kind heart. Spider load and wart of toad. Wishing well and prison cell. Cakes of oat make a dapper coat. Drops of cream fulfil his dream. Bright red fur will dazzle her. White tip tail will never fail. - Farewell, and best of luck. - Farewell, Madam, and thank you. I feel good today. Oh hey, oh hop! - Good afternoon, Mr. Fox. - My, you're happy today. - Yes, I've just been married. - Happy to hear that. - No, she was a right old nag. - I'm sorry to hear that. It wasn't that bad, for she brought riches with her. She had a house. - I'm happy to hear that. - It wasn't that good, either. The house burned down. - I'm sorry to hear that. - It wasn't all that bad. Because the house burned with the old nag in it! Good luck! Go and see who is knocking on the door. - Oh my! - Good evening. Is the Fox's Widow in? She's grieving that her husband's dead. She doesn't know what to do. - I might have some good advice for her. - Who is that knocking on the door? It's one of your suitors. He wants to give you some good advice. - What colour is his coat? - Just like your husband who is dead. Ask him to come in, my dear. His advice is welcome here. Bring me, please, my socks and shoes. This one I will not refuse. Bring me, please, my shoes of yellow. I'll go walking with this fellow. He was the one the widow wanted. Soon a wedding took place. Unless he's been to the chicken coop, they're still living happily today. Thank you so much, for the coffee and the story. You'll see, one fine day there'll be a suitor knocking on the farm house door. Then it'll be this little girl fetching the socks and shoes, I expect. Always the joker, Asbjørnsen. I'm happy with my cows and goats. And I have this little one. Yes, that's true, Irenee. Take care now, and thank you. Good bye, Mr. Asbjørnsen. And fare well.
