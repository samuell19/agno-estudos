John Kennedy: TO HALT THIS OFFENSIVE BUILDUP, A STRICT QUARANTINE ON ALL OFFENSIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT UNDER SHIPMENT TO CUBA IS BEING INITIATED. ALL SHIPS OF ANY KIND BOUND FOR CUBA FROM WHATEVER NATION OR PORT, WHERE THEY'RE FOUND TO CONTAIN CARGOS OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS, WILL BE TURNED BACK. IT SHALL BE THE POLICY OF THIS NATION TO REGARD ANY NUCLEAR MISSILE LAUNCHED FROM CUBA AGAINST ANY NATION IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AS AN ATTACK BY THE SOVIET UNION ON THE UNITED STATES. I HAVE DIRECTED THE ARMED FORCES TO PREPARE FOR ANY EVENTUALITY. [MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [GUNSHOT] [MOANS] [ALARM SOUNDS] [MEN SCREAMING] Man: LET ME GUESS. THEY'RE SENDING US MORE FILES. Man: 20 FROM GERMANY, 10 MORE FROM SUDAN. YOU KNOW, HENRY, WE'RE ON THE FRONT LINE. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BROWSE THROUGH FILES. FRONT LINE?

LET'S GO. Man: WE GOT HIM, SIR. WE GOT THE BOMBER. IT'S CASPER, SIR. THIS IS THE NINTH EMBASSY HE'S BOMBED IN 2 YEARS. HE'S GOT A LOT OF BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. Man: I WANT HIM OUT OF THERE IMMEDIATELY. WE GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF, SIR. I'VE CONTACTED THE CLOSEST EXTRACTION TEAM. THEY CAN BE THERE IN 6 HOURS. THEY'LL CHOPPER HIM INTO STUTTGART AND JET HIM OUT OF THERE. IT'S TOO RISKY. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE WORLD'S LEADING TERRORIST. HIS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LOOKING FOR HIM. WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER WAY, SIR. THE NAVY'S GOT A SUB IN THE AREA. THERE'S SOME SORT OF MANEUVERS. JACK SHAW IS THE CAPTAIN, SIR. SHAW? DIDN'T WE SEND HIM OUT THERE TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ANY REAL ASSIGNMENTS UNTIL HIS TIME WAS SERVED? YES, SIR. THAT'S BEEN THE CONDITION OF HIS CONTINUATION SINCE HE GROUNDED HIS LAST SUBMARINE. IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS? NOT REALLY, SIR. THERE IS ONLY ONE SURVIVOR-- A YOUNG AGENT NAMED TURNER. HE'S AN ANALYST, REALLY-- POLITICAL TRENDS, ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS. YOU MEAN THE COFFEE BOY. [SIGHS] TURNER'S GOT NO LEGITIMATE FIELD EXPERIENCE, BUT IF YOU WANT TO MOVE NOW, HE'S ALL WE'VE GOT. [MUSIC PLAYING] GET A HOLD OF TURNER. MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. TELL HIM HE'S GOING TO ADD A NEW CHAPTER TO HIS RéSUMé. GIVE HIM THE USUAL BULL ABOUT HONOR AND COUNTRY. YOU TELL SHAW THAT IF HE MESSES THIS UP... I WILL PERSONALLY BURY HIM AT SEA--ALIVE. [SNEEZES] GOD BLESS YOU. ♪ THEY JUST COVER UP NICE ♪ ♪ THEIR BEAUTY ♪ IS A DAGGER ♪ THAT CUTS LIKE A KNIFE [MUSIC STOPS] [YAWNS] BUMPY RIDE? MM-HMM. [LAUGHS] Man: YOU TURNER? Roy: YEAH. CAPTAIN JACK SHAW, S.S.N. ROOSEVELT. I GUESS THAT MAKES ME THE NEW BABY-SITTER. EXCUSE ME? IT'S NOT EVERY DAY I GET A CALL FROM THE ADMIRAL-IN-CHIEF TELLING ME THAT I'VE BEEN LOANED OUT. HEAR YOU GOT LUCKY AND KNOCKED ONE OUT OF THE PARK, SPECIAL AGENT. YEAH. IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THANKS. AND IT'S NOT "SPECIAL AGENT"-- JUST "AGENT" WILL DO. I'LL TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. TAKE HIM OUT. Man: YES, SIR. ♪ I CAN BE CHILLIN' ♪ I CAN SLAM ♪ I CAN BUST A MOVE... [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Woman: I LIKE THIS HIP-HOP VERY MUCH. THIS IS A NUMBER ONE HAND. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] OK. OH, YEAH. OK. OK, EVERYBODY. LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME. I MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU, MR. BRICKMAN. IF YOU WIN, I TAKE OFF EVERYTHING-- TOTALLY NAKED. Man: OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH? WELL, LET'S ROLL WITH IT. BUT IF YOU LOSE, YOU 100% NAKED BLACK MAN. WE SHOULD JUST SLAP ON IT. YEAH. WE HAVE A DEAL? AIN'T NO BACKTRACKING NOW. NO GOING BACK. SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. COME ON. AW, YEAH.

ALL RIGHT. STEP BACK. I DON'T WANT TO HURT NOBODY. CAPTAIN ON DECK. [MUSIC STOPS] AHEM. AT EASE. AS YOU'VE BEEN INFORMED, WE HAVE A VISITOR ON BOARD-- ACTUALLY, 2. SPECIAL AGENT TURNER HERE IS FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. HIS TRAVELING COMPANION HAS EVIDENTLY MADE ENOUGH OF A NAME FOR HIMSELF TO WARRANT A FREE RIDE HOME WITH US. SPECIAL AGENT TURNER HERE IS A REGULAR JAMES BOND IN THE FLESH. OH. UH, JUST AGENT TURNER IS FINE. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, AGENT TURNER. DOCTOR FINCH IS ANOTHER ONE OF OUR SPECIAL GUESTS. SHE'S ON LOAN FROM THE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE WHILE WE RUN AN ANALYSIS OF THE FASCINATING CHANGES OF THE OCEAN UNDERCURRENTS AND THE MARINE LIFE IN THE AREA. SHE'S A SPECIALIST. THAT I AM. IS, UH, THAT THE AREA? UH, UH, YEAH. AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE DEVIL'S EYE. 27 SHIPS HAVE GONE DOWN THERE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS-- ALL UNEXPLAINED. HENCE, THE OLD SAILOR'S MYTH ABOUT A GIANT SERPENT THAT ATTACKS ANY SHIP THAT DARES TO ENTER THAT PARTICULAR AREA. MAKES THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE LOOK LIKE A DUCK POND. THANK YOU, DR. FINCH. AS USUAL, YOU'VE BEEN MOST INFORMATIVE, BUT RIGHT NOW, I HAVE THE ADDED PROBLEM OF FINDING SPECIAL AGENT TURNER A SPARE BUNK. OH. REALLY? UM... BECAUSE, UH, I HAVE A SPARE BUNK. I'M SURE THE SPECIAL AGENT WOULD PREFER TO SLEEP IN THE CREW'S QUARTERS. OH. I'M SORRY. WOULD YOU RATHER-- NO, NO. THAT'S--THAT'S FINE... OH. ACTUALLY. WELL, THEN, THAT, UH, SETTLES THAT, DOESN'T IT? EXCUSE ME. I JUST, UH... HAVE TO, UM... GET MY, UH, PANTIES. MR. BRICKMAN. SIR. YOU'RE A LOUSY CARD PLAYER. PANTS UP. TAKE US DOWN. SIR. DOLPHIN DEPTH. Man: YES, SIR. YOU KNOW, I WAS A HERO ONCE. I ACTUALLY CAPTURED A WHOLE BOATLOAD OF IRAQIS IN THE GULF ACTION. OF COURSE, I HAD TO TURN THEM RIGHT BACK OVER. IT STILL PISSES ME OFF. BUT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STORY I WON'T GET INTO. Brickman: ANYBODY KNOW THIS DUDE THEY'RE BRINGING ON BOARD? HE MEANS, LIKE, TERRORIST OR SOMETHING. TERRORIST, MAN? I TELL YOU WHAT. IF MR. SPECIAL AGENT GREENHORN THINKS HE CAN HANDLE THAT GUY AND THE CAPTAIN-- HE HAS NO IDEA. NO IDEA. NO. HE HAS... NO IDEA. NO IDEA. I'LL GIVE HIM A DEAL ON SOME FLORIDA SWAMP LAND, AND HE CAN BUILD SKYSCRAPERS ON 'EM. [LAUGHS] REALLY? HOW MUCH? [SONAR PINGING] CAN I HAVE SOME WATER, PLEASE? LOOK, THERE IS NO NEED FOR ALL THIS ANIMOSITY. WE HAVE A BOND. I MEAN, YOU DID SAVE MY LIFE. I OWE YOU, ROY. I WOULD'VE DIED IN THAT CAR, BUT YOU PULLED ME OUT. NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD'VE CARED THE WAY YOU DID. IT WAS SO BRAVE OF YOU. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE. OH, THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, ROY. LIFE PRESENTS SITUATIONS. WE REACT TO THEM, WHICH IS HOW WE ARE MEASURED. THE KEY, I FIND, IS TO STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU REALLY WANT. THAT WAY, YOU WILL ALWAYS REACT ACCORDINGLY AND HAVE NO REGRETS. YOU THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE REGRETS? OF COURSE, ROY. ONE OF US HAS TO, AND IT CAN'T BE ME. IT CAN'T BE HENRY... ANYMORE. [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] YOU'RE LATE. A WOMAN'S PREROGATIVE. THAT'S HIM. AGENT ROY TURNER. HE HAS CASPER. THESE WERE PULLED FROM A RUSSIAN SATELLITE 6 HOURS AGO. THEY ARE BOTH ON BOARD. THEY'RE TRANSPORTING HIM BACK TO THE UNITED STATES VIA SUBMARINE. OUR CONTACTS ARE ACQUIRING THEIR COORDINATES AND TRAVEL ROUTES AS WE SPEAK. I'LL ORGANIZE THE ESCAPE ROUTE. JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY WHEN CASPER MAKES CONTACT. Man: AT THIS MOMENT, OUR PEOPLE ARE INFILTRATING A CRUISE LINER. Woman: YOU STOP THAT RUNNING DOWN THE HALL. IT'S DUE TO EMBARK SHORTLY. THEIR IDENTITIES ARE UNKNOWN. THEY WILL BE DISGUISED AS PASSENGERS OR CREW MEMBERS. THEY WILL NOT REVEAL THEMSELVES UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT. SORRY. Man: ONCE CASPER IS RETRIEVED, THEIR ORDERS ARE TO BLOW UP THE CRUISE LINER AND ELIMINATE ALL WITNESSES. THEY ARE PREPARED TO GIVE UP THEIR OWN LIVES IF NECESSARY. WHEN EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION, THEY WILL LOG INTO THE SHIP'S MAIN COMPUTER SYSTEM, AND AT THE MOMENT OF CONTACT ALTER ITS COURSE TO INTERCEPT WITH THE ROOSEVELT. [SHIP HORN BLOWS] [RINGS] THE CREW'S CAPTAIN HAS BEEN ORDERED TO FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS. CAPTAIN, TELEPHONE. Woman: HOW CAN YOU BE SURE HE'LL COMPLY? THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING. Man on phone: REMEMBER, WE ARE WATCHING EVERY MOVE YOU MAKE. ONE MISTAKE, AND THEY DIE. Man: WE HAVE HIS FAMILY. HE WILL DO ANYTHING WE WANT. [SCREAMS] [SIGHS] Roy: AHEM. OOH. AGENT TURNER. BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL AGAIN? YEAH, I GUESS. I TELL YOU, THE LAST WEEK HAS BEEN SO CRAZY I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY-- LET ME. OW! OOH. THANKS. WHEW. SO, YOU HAVEN'T SAID MUCH FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHAT'S YOUR STORY, TURNER? ARE YOU REALLY SOME KIND OF, UH, SUPER SPY? UH, NO, NO. THAT'S JUST SHAW TALKING. I--I'M TRAINED AS AN ANALYST. UH, THIS IS MY FIRST BIT OF FIELD DUTY. IT KIND OF CAME AS A SURPRISE... ALL AROUND. BUT YOU, UH--YOU DID ALWAYS WANT TO BE AN AGENT, RIGHT? YEAH, ACTUALLY. UM... ALTHOUGH, I DID HAVE A BACKUP PLAN. I KIND OF THOUGHT I'D BE A COLLEGE PROFESSOR. YOU KNOW, TEACH POLITICAL THEORY... W-WRITE A COUPLE BOOKS. I DON'T KNOW. CALL ME A CLICHé. I GUESS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A NICE WAY TO SEE THE WORLD. OH, REALLY? SO, UH... WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH YOU AND SHAW? YOU GUYS LIKE AN ITEM OR SOMETHING? OH, PLEASE. JACK SHAW IS A PETTY, SELF-INVOLVED, CRAZY SHELL OF A MAN. DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT CAPTURING THE BOATLOAD OR IRAQIS YET? YEAH. HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, LIKE HE SAID, HE DID CAPTURE THE ENTIRE PATROL BOAT, BUT THE PART HE TENDS TO LEAVE OUT IS THE FACT THAT HE RAN A U.S. NUCLEAR SUB AGROUND TO PULL IT OFF. HMM. WELL... YOU KNOW, I'VE--I'VE... I'VE DONE SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS MYSELF. I, UH... ACTUALLY, RIGHT-- RIGHT BEFORE THIS, I, UH--WELL, I APPREHENDED THESE 2 REALLY NOTORIOUS-- [GUNSHOT] [FLUSHES TOILET] I COULD'VE DIED OR SOMETHING. IT'S ALL YOURS. OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, WITH SHAW, IT'S ALWAYS AN ADVENTURE. HEH HEH! [CRASH] [MACHINE BEEPING] [CREW CHATTERING] WHOA. [ALARM SOUNDS] [BOTTLE BREAKS] THAT WASN'T GOOD. EXCUSE ME. [ALARM SOUNDS] RUDDER FAILURE, CAPTAIN-- UPPER AND LOWER. I'D SAY SOMETHING HIT US, BUT-- THERE'S NOTHING ON THE SCREENS. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? AH, IF IT ISN'T OUR RESIDENT VIPs. I HOPE WE DIDN'T INTERRUPT ANYTHING. YEAH. WHY ARE WE STOPPED? WE'RE EXPERIENCING WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. LOOK, DON'T WORRY. I MEAN, YOU TWO JUST GO BACK TO SLEEP. DO WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING. I'VE DISPENSED A DIVE TEAM. THEY'RE CHECKING OUT THE DAMAGE. MR. BRICKMAN, GIVE ME THE VISUALS ON THE DIVERS A.S.A.P. AYE, AYE, SIR. I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. [BREATHING QUICKLY] [STRAINING] [STIFLED SCREAMING] Brickman: LUCAS, LOPEZ, HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING OUT THERE? LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN POSITION. HEY, BRICKMAN, I'VE ONLY GOT ONE SET OF LUNGS. I'M MOVING AS FAST AS I CAN. THIS VISIBILITY'S BAD. Brickman: OK, MR. TAYLOR, LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. Taylor: OK. GOT YOU. WE GOT VISUALS. Brickman: HEY, YOU GUYS LOOK FAT ON CAMERA. YEAH, MAN. JUST LIKE YOUR LAST GIRLFRIEND. Brickman: IF WE CAN GET HER FLAPS CLOSED, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWEET TALK HER INTO SOME ACTION. SHE LIKES IT WHEN I TALK DIRTY. OOH, YOU'RE GETTING ME ALL EXCITED. LUCAS, SEE IF YOU CAN CLOSE UP THE FLAP. LOPEZ, CHECK OUT THE LOWER RUDDERS. UH, MR. BRICKMAN IS GOING TO HUMOR US WITH HIS LATEST PICKUP MOVES. CAPTAIN, WE'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THE SWEET TALKING HE'S GOT. IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING BIG HIT US. OK, LUCAS, YOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN. SEE IF YOU CAN STITCH HER UP. I'LL BE BACK. Lucas: OK, BRICKMAN, DON'T GET JEALOUS. I'M ABOUT TO WARM UP YOUR GIRLFRIEND. [BREATHING] Lopez: THIS IS LOPEZ, CAPTAIN. I'M APPROACHING THE RUDDER. MAN! LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING RIPPED INTO US WITH A GIANT CAN OPENER. [OCTOPUS ROARS] Lucas: CAPTAIN, THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE GOING ON OUT HERE. STILL THINK I SHOULD GO BACK TO SLEEP? Lucas: LOPEZ, MAN, I'M GETTIN' A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE. SOMETHING JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT. ARE YOU OK? Lopez: YEAH, I'M OK. WAIT, I THINK I SEE-- I SEE SOMETHING MOVING OUT THERE. CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN, WE'RE LOSING VISUALS ON LOPEZ. THIS IS NOT GOOD. THIS IS REALLY NOT GOOD. Shaw: TAYLOR, FIX IT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON. Lisa: WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM? Brickman: JACKSON, CHECK THAT FEED LINE NOW. [SCREAMING] Brickman: CAPTAIN, THIS DON'T LOOK GOOD. Lisa: SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING. Man: WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON OUT THERE? Taylor: THERE'S JUST SOMETHING WRONG. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG. Brickman: DAMN! LUCAS, LOPEZ, GET OUT OF THERE NOW. CAN YOU HEAR ME? GET OUT OF THERE! Man: SIR, ALL COMMUNICATIONS ARE DEAD. EXTERNAL MICROPHONES NOW. EXTERNAL MICROPHONES, AYE-AYE, SIR. [FRANTIC SCREAMING] SALVANTO, GIVE ME A PING TOTAL RADIUS. [SCREAMING] [OCTOPUS ROARS] THEY'RE GONE, SIR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GONE?

Shaw: SALVANTO, IDENTIFY. IDENTIFYING. Salvanto: IT--IT'S NOTHING, SIR. NOTHING? BUT-- WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THERE'S NO SIGNATURE MATCH. WE'VE NEVER HAD A SONAR READING LIKE THIS BEFORE. WHATEVER IT IS, THOUGH, IT'S SITTING OFF THE PORT SIDE ABOUT 200 HUNDRED METERS. AND IT'S NOT MOVING. MR. BRICKMAN, IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE CAN TURN AROUND TO FACE IT? NEGATIVE. NOT ON THESE RUDDERS. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, SIR? SIR, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THEM OUT THERE. SIR? MR. BRICKMAN... TAKE US DOWN. GO SILENT. YOU HEARD THE MAN. FULL POWER. LET'S HOPE THESE RUDDERS HOLD UP. EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN, I HATE TO POINT THIS OUT, BUT NOW MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD TIME TO CALL FOR HELP. I'M WELL AWARE OF OUR SITUATION, SPECIAL AGENT TURNER. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND CONCERN, I REALLY THINK IT'S BEST IF YOU TOOK CARE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU LET ME TAKE CARE OF MINE. LOOK, SHAW, I KNOW YOUR GAME. I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU. OH, REALLY? WE ARE OBVIOUSLY IN TROUBLE. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TRY TO BE A HERO. HERO? AND WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'D KNOW ABOUT THAT? P.A.: AGENT TURNER, REPORT TO THE BRIG. AGENT TURNER, REPORT TO THE BRIG. YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. HEY, UM, BRICKMAN, IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET A COPY OF THOSE TAPES FROM THE DIVERS? WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO THE CAPTAIN? NO, LISTEN, LISTEN, I THINK I CAN HELP HERE. HEY, LADY, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, WE JUST LOST A COUPLE OF GOOD MEN OUT THERE. AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, YOU NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET, SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU TELL ME HOW I CAN GET A COPY OF THOSE TAPES. HEY, HEY. YOU WANT 'EM? IT'S ALL DIGITAL. LOG ON TO THE SHIP'S MAINFRAME AND-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN? WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MESS AROUND WITH-- TAYLOR! ENOUGH. GREAT. BRICKMAN, I JUST-- NOT NOW.

BRICKMAN, ENGINES FULL UP, 300 METERS. AYE-AYE, SIR. THERE'S A MOUNTAIN RANGE ABOUT 7 KILOMETERS AHEAD OF US. NOW, IF I CAN GET US MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, WE CAN RUN FOR THE HILLS AND SEE IF THIS THING FOLLOWS. DROPPING REMOTE DETONATION MINES AS WE GO? WHAT DO YOU THINK? IN THESE CANYONS, I'D SAY YOU'RE CRAZY, BUT WHAT ELSE IS NEW? GOOD. LET'S ROCK. YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN. BY THE WAY, DO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING US? I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT IT'S GOT A TIGER BY THE TAIL. SALVANTO, WE'RE GOING INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY. LET'S HOPE THIS THING TAKES THE BAIT. AND, UM, WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR MAMA. Casper: IF YOU WANT HIM TO LIVE, JUST TAKE THE KEYS AND UNLOCK ME. DON'T DO IT, SIR. I'M READY TO DIE. OK, NOBODY NEEDS TO DIE. Salvanto: CHECK THIS OUT, SIR. YOU CAN STILL SEE IT. THERE! MR. BRICKMAN. DEPTH-- 300 METERS, CAPTAIN. 20 KNOTS AND CLIMBING. Taylor: 20 KNOTS CONFIRMED. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE LOOP-DE-LOOP? CONFUSE THE MOTHER. IT'S MOVING INTO POSITION. COME ON. COME ON.

BRICKMAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. CAPTAIN... 800 METERS. MAYDAY, MAYDAY. THIS IS THE SSN ROOSEVELT. WE ARE DOWN. I REPEAT, WE ARE DOWN. Lisa: I NEED A DRINK. CAPTAIN, WE'RE AT CRUSH DEPTH. SHE'S NOT GONNA HOLD. SALVANTO. SIR? GO CHECK OUT THE DAMAGE IN THE ENGINE ROOM. AYE, SIR. YOU KNOW HOW TO PRAY, MR. BRICKMAN? NOW'S THE TIME. ¡ARRIBA! [SINGING IN SPANISH] [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Maid: HELLO? [KNOCKING] IS ANYBODY THERE? HELLO? Woman: YOU FOOL, YOU LEFT THE DOOR OPEN. ROOM SERVICE. [MAID SIGHS] WHAT A MESS. I HOPE THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD TIPPERS. WHAT IS THIS? IT'S YOUR TIP. AAH! Lisa: SO, GET THIS. BASED ON ITS SIZE AND SPEED-- I MEAN, THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR THE THING THAT HIT US. BUT WE KNOW DIFFERENT, DON'T WE? WE KNOW IT'S OUT THERE, AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT TOO FRIENDLY. YOU'RE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION, CAPTAIN. IT LIVES HERE. YOU DROVE A NUCLEAR SUB THROUGH ITS LIVING ROOM. YES, IF I GET THE OPPORTUNITY, I'M GONNA BLOW IT INTO SO MANY LITTLE BITS, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO OPEN UP YOUR OWN LITTLE SUSHI RESTAURANT. YOU LIKE SUSHI, DON'T YOU? WHAT IF SOMEBODY WALKED INTO YOUR HOME AND PISSED ON YOUR CARPET? FORGIVE ME FOR APPEARING TO BE UPSET, BUT IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, WE'RE STUCK AT A DEPTH THAT... WELL, FEW MEN GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE UNLESS...WELL, THEY'RE ABOUT TO DIE. I JUST LOST 2 MEN TODAY, 2 VERY GOOD MEN. WHAT?! DID...DID THE NOISE WAKE YOU? LOOK, WE WERE ATTACKED BY AN UNDERWATER CREATURE OF SOME KIND. I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH YOUR BRIEFING, SPECIAL AGENT TURNER, I'LL BE DOWN IN THE ENGINE ROOM. I DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STOPPED PLAYING GAMES WITH THE ROOKIE AGENT, OK? CASPER'S GONE, AND YOU GOT A DEAD SAILOR ON YOUR HANDS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE'S ESCAPED. HE'S GONE. NO! THAT WAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! HE WAS YOUR PRISONER! YOU BETTER BE LYIN'! I HATE TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS, BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY ELEMENT HERE. I'M NOT A FIELD AGENT. I--I'M CERTAINLY NOT AN ESCORT. I DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT, SO I APOLOGIZE IF THINGS AREN'T GOING QUITE AS PLANNED. AND I'M ASSUMING THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW. AND WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP CALLING ME "SPECIAL AGENT"? AGENT TURNER, YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRESENTED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. NOW DO YOU WANT TO GO HIDE IN THE CLOSET, OR DO YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? IT'S OK. IT'S OK TO BE AFRAID. LOOK, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT TO BE JUST LIKE ME, DON'T YA? HUH? A MAN WHO TAKES ACTION? OH, MY GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING THIS. ACTUALLY... I'M SCARED SHITLESS. BUT I FIND THAT TO BE A HEALTHY EXPERIENCE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN. SO, SPECIAL AGENT, IF YOU FEEL UP TO IT, LET'S GO FIND YOUR PRISONER. [WRITING] OK. [BANG] [GASPS] OHH! OHH! OH, GOD. GREAT. I'M SOAKED. AAH! AAH! HA HA HA HA! OOH, I LIKE THAT IN A WOMAN. EXCUSE ME. OW! WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN WHEN I TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS, HUH? OH, GOD! UHH! NOW, IF YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL AND DO EXACTLY AS I SAY, I MIGHT BE INCLINED TO LET YOU LIVE. UH, OK. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S DISCUSS THAT SCENARIO, OK? MMM, GOOD. OK? GOOD. VERY WELL. OK. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSITIONING BUOYS ON THIS SHIP, ALL OF THEM CONTROLLED FROM THIS STATION. I WANT YOU TO CHANGE FREQUENCY SIGNAL IN ONE OF THEM, AND LAUNCH IT. DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME? BUDDY, I'LL TEACH YOU TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, OK?

[WHIMPERING] [GUNSHOT] [BEEPING] [BEEPING] Man: CASPER'S MADE CONTACT. APPROXIMATELY 20 KILOMETERS SOUTH BY SOUTHEAST. Woman: ACTIVATE THE NAVIGATIONAL OVERRIDE. WE NEED TO TURN THE SHIP AROUND. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. I'LL INFORM THE RESCUE HELICOPTER WE HAVE A HEADING. Navigator: WHAT'S HAPPENING? CAPTAIN, WE'VE CHANGED COURSE. Captain: I KNOW. DON'T BE CONCERNED. I HAVE ORDERS TO SET A NEW COURSE. CAPTAIN. THANK YOU. Woman: WHITE BIRD, THIS IS CHAMELEON. WE'VE MADE CONTACT. WE HAVE A LOCKDOWN. I REPEAT. WE HAVE A LOCKDOWN. Man: WHITE BIRD TO CHAMELEON, HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. SETTING COURSE FOR PICKUP. [GASPS] JEEZ. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE IS EVERYONE? THEY'RE ALL GONE. THEY PANICKED. I TOLD THEM, I SAID JUST STAY COOL. I ORDERED THEM TO MAINTAIN THEIR STATIONS, BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN. C-SECTION IS BREACHED. THEY'RE ALL DEAD, CAPTAIN. THEY GOT TO BE. I TOOK A READING FROM THE COMPUTER. THE REACTOR APPEARS TO BE UNSTABLE. HANGIN' ON BY A THREAD, CAPTAIN. ONE MORE HIT, I'M TELLING YOU, ONE MORE AND... FREE FALL. WHAT'S THE STATUS ON THE ENGINE? SALVANTO, HE'S--HE'S STILL WORKING ON IT. CHECK THIS OUT. Lisa: OK. I WAS ABLE TO LAUNCH A REMOTE CAMERA. BEEN CRUISING AROUND OUTSIDE THE SUB. THERE'S AT LEAST 5, 6 SHIPS DOWN HERE. I MEAN, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONAL GRAVEYARD. DEVIL'S EYE. WAIT A SECOND. GO--GO BACK. TAKE IT BACK, TAKE IT BACK. OH, MY GOD. THE LENINGRAD. Lisa: YOU KNOW IT? YEAH. IT'S INFAMOUS. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A MYTH. DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, AN AMERICAN SUBMARINE CLAIMED TO HAVE TORPEDOED A RUSSIAN SUB CALLED THE LENINGRAD. EXCEPT NO WRECK WAS EVER FOUND, AND THE RUSSIANS COMPLETELY DENIED ITS EXISTENCE. Brickman: I ALSO FOUND THESE CLOSE BY. THEY MUST HAVE SPILLED OUT WHEN THE SUB BROKE UP. Lisa: WHAT'S WITH THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES? THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE SHIPPING TO CASTRO. CAN, UH...CAN WE GET A WATER SAMPLE FROM INSIDE THERE? YOU NAME IT, I'LL TAKE IT. ENGINE ROOM. THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. OVER. SALVANTO! CAN YOU HEAR ME? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. WE ALL BETTER DO SOMETHING QUICK, OR THIS THING IS GONNA TAKE US DOWN. YEAH, THE QUESTION IS, WHICH ONE? Shaw: OK. I'M GONNA CHECK THE ENGINES. TURNER, I NEED YOU TO WATCH MY BACK. BRICKMAN, PULL THE WATER SAMPLES. DR. FINCH, DO AN ANALYSIS. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. Shaw: SALVANTO, WHERE ARE YOU? Shaw: IT'S SALVANTO. I'M GONNA NEED SOME TIME TO START HER UP. OK. ALL RIGHT, IF I'M NOT BACK IN 5 MINUTES, YOU LOCK THIS DOOR, YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. I HOPE THEY'RE OK. OH, GOD. MMM. HOW YOU DOING, BRICKMAN? HUH? YOU OK? [SCOFFS] YOU SERIOUS? LOCKED IN A ROOM WITH YOU? WHAT MORE CAN A MAN ASK FOR? UH...TO LIVE? Roy: OH, MY GOD. NO! COME ON, CASPER! COME ON! WHAT DO YOU GOT? COME ON, ROY, IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO? LET'S GO. THAT'S THE SPIRIT! FIGHT, ROY! FIGHT! THAT'S IT, ROY. WE'RE ALL SQUARE. LAST TIME I LET YOU LIVE, BUT NOT NOW. HA HA HA HA! [LAUGHING] DON'T MOVE. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S VERY GOOD, ROY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A REALLY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTIN' OUT OF HERE ALIVE, SO WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY I DON'T KILL YOU RIGHT NOW? UH... Shaw: BECAUSE... YOU GOT A JOB TO DO. THE ENGINES ARE DEAD. BRICKMAN WAS RIGHT. THE REACTOR'S UNSTABLE. WE GOT 25 MINUTES BEFORE THE ROOSEVELT EXPLODES. HEY. COME ON. LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE. Lisa: WELCOME HOME, GUYS. ROUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE? Shaw: OH, YOU KNOW, COPIER JAM, KILLER SEA MONSTERS, THE USUAL. HA. I WISH. THIS THING IS A THIRD OR FOURTH CYCLE MUTATION OF WHAT WAS ONCE PROBABLY AN OCTOPUS. LISTEN, I, UH, BROKE DOWN THE WATER SAMPLE FROM INSIDE THE RUSSIAN SUB. IT CONTAINS A CRUDE PATHOGEN FORM CALLED TRICOTHECENE MYCOTOXIN. OK? FANCY NAME FOR THE ANTHRAX VIRUS. BIOLOGICAL WARFARE? UH-HUH. THIS STUFF IS A SYNTHETIC HYBRID. VERY POWERFUL. Roy: THAT EXPLAINS THE ENTIRE COVER-UP. IF KENNEDY HAD KNOWN, HE WOULD HAVE LAUNCHED. I MEAN, THE BACTERIA IN IT MUST HAVE AFFECTED THIS THING'S ANCESTORS, AND THE MUTATION HAS COMPOUNDED OVER EACH GENERATION. WELL, EXPLAINING ITS INCREDIBLE GOOD LOOKS AND, UH, GOOD NATURE OF OUR LITTLE FRIEND, YEAH. HA HA HA! AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THIS THING ALSO SUFFERS FROM AN EXTREME IRON DEFICIENCY. HENCE THE OVERAGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. UH-HUH. NOW, IT'S NOT JUST A MUTANT, BUT IT'S ANEMIC? YEAH. CONSIDERING ITS SIZE, ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS THING HAS A CRAVING FOR MEAT THAT WOULD SCARE A COW OUT OF ITS SKIN. WHITE MEAT OR DARK MEAT? OK. IF THIS CREATURE NEEDS MEAT, THEN THAT MEANS THERE'S A WAY WE CAN BAIT IT, RIGHT? UH, SO, WHAT? YOU SUGGESTING WE DRAW STRAWS? NO. NOT QUITE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH TIME FOR US TO BUY OURSELVES SOME TIME AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE WITH THAT SUBMERSIBLE. YEAH, I GOT A GREAT IDEA. WHY DON'T WE GET AHOLD OF SOME T-BONES, AND WE CAST OUT SOME LINES? NO, NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. ROY IS ONTO SOMETHING HERE, OK? PROTO-LYTE. Shaw: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? IT'S A HIGH POTENCY MIX OF AMINO ACIDS AND MINERALS, SPECIFICALLY IRON. I USE IT TO FEED DOLPHINS AND WHALES. MM-MMM. FLIPPER FOOD. SEE, NOW, YOU'RE LOSING ME. OK, LISTEN, IT IS THE PROTEIN THAT THIS THING IS AFTER, NOT US, OK? I MEAN, IT COULD SUCK ON A BOTTLE OF THIS FOR HOURS. Roy: OK, THAT'S IT, THEN. WE PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THIS IN ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPARTMENTS, WE LEAD THE CREATURE TO IT, AND WE LET IT FEED. BINGO. WELL, LISTEN, I HATE TO BRING THIS UP, BUT WE HAVE, WHAT, 18 MINUTES BEFORE THIS SUB TURNS INTO A MICROWAVE. 18 MINUTES? YEAH. Lisa: THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ON MY PART. YEAH, WELL, IT'S A PROBLEM ON MY PART. WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE TALKING? LET'S DO SOMETHING. WELL, COME ON, CAPTAIN. YOU'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU WANT TO GO HIDE IN A CLOSET, OR YOU WANNA GET SOMETHING DONE? PLEASE WARN SPECIAL AGENT TURNER THAT HE'S ABOUT TO PUT HIMSELF IN VERY SERIOUS PHYSICAL DANGER. AW, DID I HURT YOUR FEELINGS? YOU WANT DR. FEELGOOD HERE TO MAKE YOU FEEL-- TURNER, YOU-- YEAH?! HEY, LISTEN, BREAK IT UP, ALL RIGHT? THE TESTOSTERONE LEVEL-- JESUS, I'M DROWNING IN IT. MOVE IT, CASPER. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. Brickman: WHAT'VE WE GOT? 6 MINUTES. OK, EVERYONE, JUST SHAKE IT UP, POUR IT EVERYWHERE. YEAH, YOU WANT IT? YOU GOT IT. COME ON, BABY! DINNER TIME! [SQUEAK] Lisa: YOU HEAR IT? EXTERNAL MIKES ARE STILL ON. Roy: SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S HUNGRY. SHE SMELLS IT. JUST A LITTLE LONGER. Brickman: QUICK! COME ON! IT'S COMING. I HOPE THIS WORKS. THIS HAS GOTTA WORK. IT'S GOTTA WORK. PAYBACK'S A MOTHER. Shaw: ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP! THERE MAY BE AIR POCKETS DOWN THERE, BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S FLOODED. THE SUBMERSIBLE'S OUR ONLY WAY OUT. WHAT IF THIS THING'S ALREADY DOWN THERE? Shaw: THAT'S WHAT I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT. HA. OK, IF I'M NOT BACK IN 30 SECONDS, YOU JUST HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IT'S ALL CLEAR AND COME ON THROUGH. EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND? Brickman: 30 SECONDS. Lisa: OK. SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. Roy, Lisa: YOU GOT TO SAY IT THAT WAY? Roy: OK, OK, LET'S GET READY. HEY, HEY, HEY, I--I CAN'T SWIM WITH THESE ON. OH, I CAN'T, I CAN'T, I CAN'T. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU, CASPER, HUH? EVER SINCE I KICKED YOUR ASS, YOU'VE BECOME SUCH A WIMP. 20, 21, 22, 23... Brickman: COME ON, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. 25, 26, 27, 28... LET'S GO. THAT'S IT. OK, LET'S GO. Lisa: THINK HE'S GONNA MAKE IT? 29... IT'S TIME TO GO. HE MUST HAVE MADE IT. 30. DOWN WITH ME? AAH! COME ON! OK. OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. UHH! WHOA. WHOA, HO HO HO HO. BRICKMAN, ONE WORD-- ONE LITTLE WORD...OK? AAH! [COUGHING] BRICKMAN? COME ON! COME ON! COME ON, BABY. COME TO PAPA. Lisa: TURNER, WHERE ARE YOU? AAH! AAH! [LISA SCREAMS] Roy: COME ON, CASPER, SWIM. SWIM! WE GO TO GET OUT OF HERE! LET'S GO! Casper: I CAN'T MAKE IT! UHH! OH, MY GOD! WE'RE GOING TO DIE! COME ON, YOU GUYS! SWIM! AAH! AAH! LISA! Roy: OH, GOD! OH, GOD! AAH! Roy: HOLD ON, I'M COMING! DON'T GO! DON'T! Brickman: GET OUTTA HERE! GO! GO! BRICKMAN, HOLD ON! BRICKMAN! [SCREAMING] LISA, GET OUT OF THERE! OH, MY GOD! Shaw: COME ON. OK. OH, GOD. THAT'S A NICE OUTFIT, BUT DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TIME? SHAW, NOT NOW. Casper: UHH! BE CAREFUL, DAMN YOU! COME ON, CASPER. COME ON, GET UP! MOVE IT! WHERE'S BRICKMAN? HE DIDN'T MAKE IT. OH, GOD. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, WE GOTTA GET MOVIN'. COME ON. THE REACTOR'S GONNA BLOW. OK. EVERYBODY, GET YOUR GOOD-BYES IN. COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WE GOT 3 MINUTES. LET'S START HER UP. AAH, OK. HEY, TURNER, YOU BRING ANY LEMONS? WHY? 'CAUSE I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO NUKE US UP SOME CALAMARI. COME ON. COME ON! DON'T FAIL ME NOW. Roy: IT'S RIGHT ON TOP OF US! Shaw: GET HER UP BEFORE THIS THING CRUSHES US! COME ON! WE GOT 20 SECONDS! Lisa: COME ON! WHAT'S THE MATTER? IT WON'T DISENGAGE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT WON'T DISENGAGE? HEY, LOOK, WE CAN'T GO OUTSIDE AND PUSH IT. Lisa: ONE MORE HIT, AND WE'RE LUNCH. DO SOMETHING! COME ON, BABY, YOU CAN DO IT! OK, HERE WE GO. HOLD ON TO YOUR BOXERS, BOYS. ONE LAST TIME FOR MAMA, BABY. COME ON. READY... TO LAUNCH! GO! GO! COME ON. COME ON, BABY, COME ON. OH, YES! OH, YEAH. AAH! WHOA! Lisa: HANG ON, EVERYONE! OHH. GENTLEMEN, I THINK WE DID IT. DOCTOR, I COULD KISS YA. IN YOUR DREAMS, SHAW. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S WEARING THE WET T-SHIRT. HEY, COULD ONE OF YOU GUYS STOP QUARRELIN' AND TELL ME WHAT THE HELL THAT IS? [LAUGHING] Lisa: TELL ME I'M DREAMIN'. WELL, THAT, SPECIAL AGENT TURNER, LOOKS TO BE OUR RIDE HOME. THANK YOU. REALLY? OK, TAKE HER UP. WITH PLEASURE. LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Man: HEY. HELLO. Roy: HEY! DOWN HERE! [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] THIS WAY. CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN? JACK SHAW, CAPTAIN, S.S.N. ROOSEVELT.

LET'S ESCORT OUR GUESTS DOWN TO THE ENGINE ROOM. Roy: I'M GOING NOWHERE. Lisa: LEAVE HIM ALONE. Roy: OHH! LEAVE HER. THANK YOU. Pilot: WHITE BIRD TO CHAMELEON. ESTIMATED PICKUP IN 12 MINUTES. Casper: LIFE'S BUT A WALKING SHADOW-- A POOR PLAYER WHO FRETS AND STRUTS HIS HOUR UPON THE STAGE AND THEN IS HEARD NO MORE. IT IS A TALE TOLD BY AN IDIOT-- FULL OF SOUND AND FURY, SIGNIFYING NOTHING. CAPTAIN... THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE RADAR. [RADAR BEEPING] Woman: WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? Captain: WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S BIG, AND IT'S MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION. OH, MY GOD. IT'S COMING CLOSER.

I MEAN, THE CREATURE'S RIPPED IT HALF APART, AND IT'S COMING BACK FOR MORE. ALL RIGHT, THEN, WHY DON'T WE JUST, UH, SHOVE IT DOWN THE DAMN THING'S THROAT? SHAW, THIS IS SERIOUS.
