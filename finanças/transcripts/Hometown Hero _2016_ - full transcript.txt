Daisy ll want to chew right through those. - I ll take care of that right away. - And she s not left alone for too long during the day, is she? Like when you re at work or out? Dogs don t really like that, especially at her age. - Well, when I m at work, my mom comes by to check on her, and aside from the office, I m pretty much always here.

Wouldn t want another cobbler incident. - Okay, that cobbler would have gone uneaten if she didn t always jump on everything. When can we train that out? I feel like every time she sees me, she wants to jump on me. - Well, jumping is actually an instinctive display of affection from a dog. When they re puppies, they learn to lick their mother s face and eyes. That s why Daisy jumps on you. She just wants to lick your face because she recognizes you as her mother. - That actually sounds kind of sweet. - Yeah. - I know she doesn t look like a handful, but I wouldn t be able to handle this without you. - It s no problem, really.

They can t know that I ve lost her. - Hey, don t worry. We will find her, okay?

No. But you can t always know how things are gonna turn out. Like your clients, none of them got married knowing it would end in divorce. - Trust me, I have seen plenty of couples where divorce was no surprise. - Okay, maybe that was a bad example. What about Daisy? - What about her? - Well, you didn t think you d like Daisy, but now you re worried sick about her, and I don t think it s just because of work. - Wait a minute.
