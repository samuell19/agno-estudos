Operation Typhoon is approaching drop-off facility. Reminder that only PBR-2942 is authorized to enter the grounds. All other escort vehicles must sign off and make their way back to their designated locations immediately. Copy. PBR-2941 signing off. PBR-2940, signing off. PBR-2942, please confirm. Continue to drop-off facility. Copy, confirming. Approaching drop-off facility now. Roger that, 2942, please confirm once drop-off is complete. Copy, will do. Over and out until operation complete. Are you okay? - Sir? - Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. You haven't talked in the last few miles. It's unlike you. Hey, watch it. Just because I've known you since we were five doesn't mean I won't kick your ass. Been way too quiet in there all of a sudden. Okay, really, what's the deal, though, man? I just don't like not knowing what we're transporting. Yeah. Hey, it's part of the job, though, right? I suppose. Just want to know a little more then, uh... "Here's a weird gun. "Keep it hush, and oh, don't mind the growls." Yeah. Are your alive in there? What was that? Ah! You hear that? Come on, come on, come on! Ah! Pull over, pull over! Private Conners? Do you hear me, Private Conners? Storm, this is PBR 2942. Operation Typhoon has been potentially compromised PBR 2942, state the nature of your compromise. Team is unresponsive. PBR 2942, stay clear of the vehicle. We are sending a transport and back up right now. We have your location. Roger. What are you doing? Anything that's not part of the plan has to be called in. You know that. Everything all right? Cargo's missing. They got out. Where's Conners? PBR 2429? Do you read me! PBR 2942, please respond! Do you read me? Are you there? Please come in, are you there? Captain? Captain! Ah! Major Tanner. Corporal Higgins, We've encountered a problem with a typhoon transport. The convoy has stopped two miles from here and is not responding. I want you out there. I need some eyes on the ground. Yes, sir. But wasn't another squadron just deployed, sir? Colonel Ramirez dispatched a team, but I want you there. Evaluate exactly what we're dealing with and keep a low profile. - Understood? - Yes, sir. How long until these eggs hatch? Any day now, ma'am. Good. I need these new assets up and running. Is there a problem, doctor? The internal temperature of the eggs is a bit low, but it's within the tolerances. Is there something wrong with the embryos? No. The heartbeats are all strong. Good. Keep an eye on these eggs. Inform me immediately if there are any changes. Yes, Colonel Ramirez. Yeah. I think Cade can go all the way. I had court side seats to his first college game. Feel that? Man, I'm trying to tell you about the first time I saw Cade. You got a dog? Are there bears here? Bears. No. What is that? Let me get my gun. Get on out of here! Get. Shoo! Hey, Bill. You see anything yet? Not yet. What are those? Bill? Bill? Ugh... Oh... Oh, no. Bill. Oh... Corporal Higgins for Major Tanner. Go ahead, Corporal. The convoy's been hit, sir. Multiple fatalities, no survivors. Can you determine the cause of death? It seems like some sort of animal got to them, sir. I see these cages in the trailer. You know what they were hauling? Classified as need to know Corporal. That includes me as well. Look, I want you to stay there, see if you can figure anything else out. Yes, Major. What would do this? Hello, General Greer. Colonel, the Operation in South America was a massive success. Let's not allow a minor setback to distract us from achieving our goal, okay? A minor setback? If we don't get this under control. There's no coming back from this, sir. Well, that's precisely why I'm relying upon you to handle this situation with utmost priority. Yes, General. I'm sure I don't need to remind you of the substantial financial gain in this project, Colonel. I'm aware, General. We're investing in the future, Colonel. Conventional warfare is costly, especially costly when it comes to human life. Costs of that type in a world where it doesn't need to be. Are we on the same page, Colonel? Yes, General, of course. Now I'm instructing you to use whatever means necessary to accomplish this without loss of life. Loss of life? Regarding the assets, sir? I've seen too many lives lost on the battlefield. Spoken to too many parents about their sons or their daughters being lost forever. Yes, General. 'Course, I'd be a liar if I didn't acknowledge the substantial financial gain from the private sector in all of this. Of course, General. Exactly. Of course, I don't want these things eating our kindergartners on the way to school tomorrow either. So you have your work cut out for you. Retrieve my assets alive with as little departmental collateral damage as possible and zero further issues with the public. Are we clear? Crystal clear, sir. But what about the civilian disturbances? I'll handle that. You've got enough to contend with. Keep me apprized. Major Tanner, meet me in research in ten. Is everything ready? Play the recording, then get out. Colonel? What I'm about to show you is highly classified, and I've been authorized to include you. Yes, ma'am. Convoy Typhoon was carrying a new weapon that we confiscated from a civilian company a few years ago. What kind of weapon? Biological. Ma'am, a civilian company made a biological weapon? It's like nothing we've ever seen before. Has the potential to save a lot of American lives. Okay. But it sounds like something went wrong. The cargo was a living weapon being transported to a military facility nearby for combat training. And it's escaped. I see. It's a potential threat to the general population now. The assets are now roaming free and that makes every civilian a potential target. What you need me to do, ma'am? Well, I put out a call to lure them back to base, but I'm not sure if it's going to work. Can I ask... what is "them?" Allosauruses. Allosauruses? Like, dinosaurs? That's correct. What in the world? They were developed by a civilian company down in South America. They intended on selling them to the highest bidder. But after a few incidents, we decided to confiscate it and all of their research. Presently, there are two of them that have escaped. And I put out a call from their mothers to lure them back to base. There are more of these, ma'am? Yes. Why wasn't I informed on this? We're on a need to know basis, Major. The less people who know about this, the better. I understand that, ma'am, but, uh, as head of Special Forces on base... I'm aware of your position. - Yes, ma'am. - You're Special Forces. Two Silver Stars. You have an incredible ability to handle tactical analysis. That was a long time ago, ma'am. Still. I'm very confident in your ability. Thank you for the vote of confidence, ma'am. What do I need to do? Prepare for an assault on our base. An assault? Aren't they just animals? No. They're so much more. Take a look at this here. This is an extremist group in South America. We received intel that they were planning an attack. So I decided to give our secret weapons the task of clearing the compound. I sent in just two Allosauruses and they cleared the entire compound out. How did you control them? There's no need. They're so territorial that wherever you drop them, they're going to wipe the place out. How do we get them back? We prerecorded sounds from their mother and we put the tape in the crate and open it up and they walk right in. Where are the crates now? Unfortunately, they were destroyed when they escaped the convoy. So what I would like you to do, Major, is I would like you to corral them up, bring them back to where they're supposed to be. That means bring them in... alive. Yes, ma'am. One more thing. Bullets don't work. These people who developed them, they thought it would be smart to, uh... make them thick skinned. They are compact versions of a traditional Allosaurus. This allows them to be faster, more agile. How do we fight them if they're bulletproof? The best we have is an energy weapon. What it does is it produces an electric shock. They're limited to a single shot before the fuse needs to be replaced. I'll try my best to control these creatures, ma'am. We'll have to lock down the barracks on base to keep all personnel safe. But I have to let my team know what they're up against. They don't have to know all the details. - But... - Do you trust them? With my life. Good. We'll lock down the facility, and I'll send all the employees who don't need to be here home. We'll keep two infantry squads on stand by in the barracks in case things get out of hand. So you and your team can proceed unencumbered. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Major. Colonel Ramirez is in charge of the assets recapture. Yes. I'm aware of the civilian attack on the RV park. A cleanup crew is on site handling it. I assure you, nothing will be left. The site will be contained and sterilized. No evidence will be left. Copy that? You know... Ramirez. I haven't heard from you, Colonel. Apologies, General. I was assembling a special ops team to recapture our assets. The men understand the critical need of bringing these assets back alive, yes? Yes, General. They are well aware. All right. Is the auditory recall working? It appears so. And any other reports on civilian encounters? Not that I'm aware of, sir. Very well. Don't make me initiate contact again. I want updates every hour. - Yes, sir. - Get it done. Colonel. This is Corporal Higgins. Lieutenant Richardson. Lieutenant Peters. I'm assuming Major Tanner informed you of the situation? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. This is our plan to handle them if they get out of control. Packs one hell of a shock, but it's flawed and we haven't quite figured it out yet. The current capacitor cannot handle the charge running through it and it needs 5 seconds to warm up before you fire it. What? Hits hard, but it is slow. The tech team likes to call it the slug gun. It's still in its very early stages of development, but you're going to have to work with it. They'll breach that gate soon. It should already be here. We've been tracking their movement with a police scanner. Police scanner? Monitoring activity. Animal activity. Dogs, cats, disturbances. We're also repositioning the satellites in this area. However, focusing satellites on military bases requires... I'm aware, court order. Continue with the police scanning. What have you found? Last contact was less than a mile away. 15 minutes ago. There was a few dead horses on a private farm, but... - No other human contact? - No, ma'am. Not that we're aware of. Very well. Are you ready? Yes, ma'am. They'll come in from the north, so we'll have to use the utility tunnels. It's a natural choke point. So we set up an ambush for them there... if we can get there in time. Major, confirming both assets have entered the tunnels. They need to come through here to get to the mother. It's quiet. Get into positions. Higgins with me. Keep your eyes open. Should we be concerned about the people that work here? I haven't seen anybody. Colonel shut the entire base town. Everybody's probably left. Peters, check in. I got blood over here. Do you see anything else? They're already here. Richardson? Come with me. Richardson! No. Colonel, got one down. The plasma blast seems to have killed it. Major, your orders were to try to capture assets alive. That was our intent, but the plasma blast had a stronger effect on the asset than expected. Casualties? Lieutenant Richardson. There might be more. I don't know who was left. But there's a lot of blood. Copy. Be careful with the other one. Understood. Richardson was a good soldier. Don't focus on her now. Just... Focus on what's in front of you, Corporal. It's the only way you're going to get through this. Hey, we only have one more, so we got the advantage. Right? It's outside. Grab her gun. We have to find that dinosaur now. Let's go. What? They hit the barracks first. Don't. What if there's someone still still alive in there? There isn't. They're all dead. The dinosaurs must have ambushed them after the lock-down orders. Keep moving. Keep moving! Go. What's your status? We've lost one asset, General. Explain. Asset three somehow managed to get electrocuted. Our newly developed plasma tech malfunctioned and terminated the asset instead of stunning it. Those weapons were our only line of defense. Do you have any other means of containing the assets? I'm still gathering intel, sir. I don't personally have eyes on it. I trusted you to handle this, Colonel. I'm doing the best I can, sir. What is the status of asset one? All clear, General. Still contained, no issues. All right. I have to go. - General? - Yes? One last word, if I may. Given our constraints, time and tactical wise, as long as asset one remains stable and healthy, how important is it to keep asset two alive? I want you to do everything in your power to ensure the recovery of asset two. But to answer your question, yes, the mother and her hatchlings are top priority. Get this situation under control by any means necessary, Colonel. Ma'am. What happened? Why aren't you in the field? They must have seen us coming. They took out an entire barracks. Everyone? It's looking for the female, the mother. It's headed straight here. We need to fortify the area. What about the other one? Ma'am? The one you killed? Yes, ma'am. I shot it. I shot it. Are you sure it's dead? Yeah. I don't know what dead looks like with these guys, but if it's like anything else, yeah. These are just animals, Colonel, right? Not anymore, Lieutenant. These aren't the original dinosaurs we confiscated. They're second generation. The first generation was killed when they were testing for combat effectiveness to the highest bidder. Okay, so who made these? Look, ma'am, we can contain the last one of them. But my suggestion is you leave the base. It's not safe anymore. Which one did you kill? I don't understand. They all look the same. Think, Corporal, did it have any distinct markings on it? Oh, the one that attacked us had a scar on his nose. That's why only one shot worked. That's the weaker one. He always followed his big sister's lead. - That was the weak one? - Yes. She put that marking on him on purpose to keep him in this place. What's the status of the slug guns? One of them were discharged, but the others still have one shot. They work, but they're not good for a fight. We can't rely on weapons that only shoot once. I was going to mention Colonel. I was a demolition specialist in my unit. Perfect. All right, everyone, this is what we're going to do. Have a look here. It's headed towards a lab where the female Allosaurus is being held captive. There's still one on base? Yes, the one with the eggs. We need to destroy them. This mother here, we need to keep her alive. Ma'am, I don't think that's a great idea. Major Tanner, the mother can control the temperament of the hatchlings. And if she can control them, then we can control the situation. Now, the other dino, who's escaped, we cannot control. So, yes, we can destroy her. But this one we need to keep alive. Can we be sure she's heading towards the mom? They're smart. They have a rudimentary knowledge of strategy. It's quite impressive, actually. Okay. I'll lure it. We don't have a choice. Good. I'll stay here and be your eyes on the base. You need to get it to a choke point and then release the explosives. Yes, ma'am. It ain't nothing to set off some claymores. We'll be able to to focus our energy into one location. Very good. Now head over to the munitions depot and get all the supplies that you need. And if anyone questions you, you tell them that I authorized it. Yes, ma'am. What do you need me to do, ma'am? Help the lieutenant set up the trap. I'll be here on walkie. Dismissed. What's your ETA, Lieutenant? Just finishing up now, Ma'am. Make sure you're pointing those in the right direction. Watch the collateral. Copy. - We good? - Yeah. Charges set. Let's get it. I'm hearing something out here. What is it? Almost sounds like a bird. Be careful. They picked up mimicking birds on the mission in South America. Copy. Eyes on target. Good, lead it to the research lab. Shit. Incoming! I'm right here! Come on. I'm right here, you son of a bitch! Come on. Come on. Come on. We got you, come on! What the hell? What's it doing? I don't know. It's playing with the trash can. A trash can? What is going on? Come on. Come on. What are you doing? Clever girl. No... no. Hey. Take cover! Take cover! Tanner, report. I can't see anything! Tanner, report! What is going on? I can't see anything. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, report! What is happening? Answer me. She tripped our wires! Calm down. Damn it, what the hell just happened? How'd a damn dinosaur know to do that? Focus, okay? Focus. It's still out there, it's still hungry. I got a body. - It was waiting. - Stay there. Waiting? Waiting on what? Stay with me. She's gone. Oh, God. Hey. She's alive. You okay? You gonna be okay? What was it waiting for? It was waiting for her to open the door. It had been biting at its chains for weeks when we fed it. We thought it was just aggression, but... it was weakening them. Wait. The dinosaur that was chained up is gone? What about the eggs? What about the eggs? I don't know. I don't see any eggs. Then she took the eggs. So now there's eggs out there. Okay. How many of them are out there? That are left? The daughter, the mother and the three eggs. Okay, so we got two adults and the eggs. Major Tanner. Colonel Ramirez. Report back to command now. Yes, ma'am. You're safe here. This room is one of the most secure locations on base. Okay. How safe is it? Nuclear bomb safe. Well, okay, good. We need to regroup. Think of a better strategy. Carrie, how are you doing? Not good. Bottle of whiskey's right there. Colonel, is the plan still to contain these creatures? The mother and her eggs, we need to preserve. It's going to be tough now that she's protecting her young. When are these things supposed to hatch? Soon. Very soon. What's soon? Days? Weeks? Could be days. This is new science. Okay. So what's the next course of action? This whole project is going to hell. Those animals get out into the wild, and they breed. It'll be catastrophic. Who's even funding this? The DOD? Goes way deeper than that. Okay, do we have any more Tasers? Not enough. The problem with the guns, it's that we haven't found the right medium for the capacitor yet. See, the fuse goes right in there. It's heavy. It's tungsten. It's one of the few things we could find that wouldn't melt after one shot. Can we just blow them up? We tried that already. Need to find them first. Now they're smart. They couldn't have gone far. She'll be looking for a secure place to build her nest. Somewhere away from the lab and the confinement she endured there. Where? The grounds around the base are too cold. She'll be looking for someplace warmer. Okay. Have you tried quartz? It's been used for thousands of years for its specific electric resonance. Where are we going to find quartz? There's some in the lab at my desk. It could work. Okay. Well, I'll go get it. No, I can go. No, I need you to stay here. I need you to figure out where they're nesting. Do a topical heat scan of the geography. Find the hotspots. The quartz is at my desk. It's in the little pen holder thingy. The pen holder thingy. Okay. Affirmative. Major! You got incoming! All clear, Major. She's gone. This quartz modification will enable the weapon to shoot multiple times without needing to be replaced. Okay. This should work. Amazing. They've been working on that for weeks. Well done. Now, to go on the hunt. Did you check for hotspots? Yes, there are 12. Twelve, okay. Yeah, but we can knock off half of them. Near mechanical ducts, heat vents, that kind of thing. This spot needs to be safe as well as warm. Okay. Half, six. Maybe less. We can try the first three with the highest probability. That sounds better. Three. With a confidence of 73%. I like those odds. Let's move. Okay. Now I got to pee. I'm not going with you. Fine, some fearless leader you are. If I get attacked, I'm bringing them back here to you. I hope you have good news. I do, sir. The assets are still on base and about to be contained. That's good to hear. We sunk a lot of resources into this project. I know, sir, but something good did come out of this. We've developed a new, ammoless weapon system. I'll send over the specs. Quartz. - Is that the main element? - Appears so. Excellent work. Dr. Carrie Azzi came up with it. But you'll be careful. Correct? I don't want you taking down all our assets. Of course, sir. I'll preserve one egg and one female. We can save so many lives if these creatures did the fighting for us, couldn't we? I know, sir. It's just up ahead. Down this hallway. Should be near two source generators. Seems like a pretty nice place to start a family. Focus, Higgins. Eyes on! - Where do it go? - I can't see it. Are those eggs? - What's left of them. - There's two of them! That's great, frigging great. Okay, we've got a couple more to deal with. Yeah, a few more. There's only three of us! Calm down. We take the big ones first, then we get the babies. Any one of them could kill us. We've got this. We kill this dinosaur before the other egg hatches. Or they escape the base. We have to. Colonel, any sign of them? Negative. Keep moving. Dr. Azzi, which way did the small one run? Dr. Azzi. Huh? Oh, to the West Corridor. That's mostly commissioned officer offices, right? I believe so. That leads out to the back of the base. You're going to kill these beasts, right, Colonel Ramirez? What? They can't survive. Let me worry about that. These are animals. Unpredictable. They can't be let out unencumbered on the world. Thank you for your concern. I feel the same. Right. Anything for good and justice. What is it that you're implying? Don't let them out. Or we're all dead. Where you at, you friggin' bastards? Colonel. We've lost sight of the dinosaur. I know. We have monitors all over the base. The eggs have hatched. Do you have any sight of the assets? No, but we'll keep on it. If we see anything, I'll let you know. It's Dr. Azzi with you? I'm here. What's the next location? The next one warm area on the map. Not too far. Room full of power walls. It's a building over. Major... Yes, Doctor? Please be careful. Got it. They're not out here. Sir, this is so messed up. Where's Higgins? Higgins? Higgins? No, no. He's gone. No! No! We're flying blind here, man! Damn it. Why didn't we hear him? Why didn't he scream? It went straight for the throat. He didn't have a chance. What, is it... It's that tactical? How do they know how to do that? It's probably instinctual. No, no. Look, the military built these things, okay? So they probably got some... some kind of. - Hyper-weird intelligence or... - Stop! - We're alive. - Yeah? - Tell that to fuckin' Higgins! - Calm down! Lieutenant. Calm down. Sir, they are literally waiting for us. Yeah. So we change the plan. Yeah. And do what? We don't go to them. They come to us. And do what? - Set a trap. - We tried explosives. Okay, so we try again, but we try it different. Okay, so how are we going to lure them in? The babies. The same baby that killed Higgins? That was a big one that did this. How do you know that? We don't know that. If that's true, that just means that the mom or the big sister is literally around the corner. Probably. I've got an idea. Colonel, Carrie. Corporal Higgins, I'm so sorry. Is it possible for you to isolate sounds of the baby dinosaurs from the security cameras around the base? Yes. Good. Why, Major? We're going to lure them in. Can you create a 15 second loop? Okay, we can do that. Great. When it's done, send it to my phone. What? What's our plan while we wait. We find one. We keep shooting until it stops moving. Grab Higgins' gun. We'll come back for him. I promise. I was just about to call you, General. Yeah, there's been another incident discovered. I'm on the way there now. The assets had more contacts than anticipated. - Human casualties? - It appears so. I'm growing concerned we're not going to be able to contain this. I'd have to agree, sir. Look, we need to figure out a story to spin this, if it gets out, and it most likely will. Yes, sir. Perhaps you can portray this operation as a recovery and containment operation. The assets were developed in house, and somehow they just got out. We're holding them, we'll say, to do more research on their origin, their purpose. - How does that sound? - Sounds good, sir. All right. The big thing is we're going to need to pin this on a private sector company. You got that? In the meantime, get this under control now. - Yes, General. - Out. How long is it going to take you to get these chirps? I don't know. 20 minutes? They'll be dead in 20 minutes. - You have five. - Fine. Give me access to the computers. You're going to need to give me security passes. It's not a problem, Doctor. I don't like this, sir. There's way too many openings for them to attack. It's the best location we've got. We could set up some fortifications to hide behind over there. Good idea. I got it. What? Audio file. Okay. Ready? Ready. Look, you really think this is going to work? It'll work. Did you get the file? Yes, ma'am. It's playing now, we're waiting. When I was researching my thesis how volcanic eruptions affected creatures of the Triassic period, I came across an article on volcanic lightning. What are you saying? There's a lot of carbon released in the eruptions that blanket a lot of fossils I studied. And that pure carbon is highly conductive. And it causes these ash clouds to light up with electrical discharges. Okay. If we can combine this carbon... with the quartz, we might just be able to amplify the power discharged. This will make the plasma gun more powerful against the creatures. I say give it a try. What do we have to lose at this point? Okay. Here they come. Come on! Ah! It's not going down! Keep shooting! Hold fire, hold fire! They're gone. Come on. Why isn't it working? The skin's too thick. We need to find a weak spot. Don't have any weak spots! Stand firm. We may have found a way to supercharge the weapons. Colonel, the guns are too weak. Backup is on the way. Hold firm, Major. Copy that. You sure about this? Definitely not. Damn it. Nothing's working! We just need to keep him distracted. Colonel's sending back-up. They remind me of some gator crawling. You a Southern boy, Lieutenant? No. Cousins, though. Usually the best way to kill the gators is through the underbelly. You've been gator hunting? No. No, sir. They're usually hunting for us every time we go to visit. Even lost a cat once. That sucked. Synchronize your shots. Peters! Son of a bitch! Duck! Keep shooting! - Did you see the big one? - No. Damn it! They're running back to the nest. What are you doing here, doctor? I need to tell you something. What? I overheard the colonel and general talking. They want to keep one of the hatchlings alive. And the mother, too. God damn it. They can't get out into the wild. Look, it's not my mission, doc. I'll keep them here. I won't let these monsters leave the base. Wait. I need to go with you. I have to make sure. They're my responsibility, too. Okay. Follow me. This has gotten sloppy. That's putting it mildly, sir. I'm beginning to think this isn't salvageable. Agreed. The eggs have also started to hatch. The eggs are hatching, now? Unfortunately, yes, General. We can't control it, sir. - You killed two of them? - Yes. I thought you said you didn't have the firepower. Dr. Azzi corrected that, she made modifications. Okay, well, that's good to hear, I promise you. Yes, sir. - Okay, proceed. I spoke to soon. - I understand. Soldier, continue to update me. - Yes, sir. - Out. Shit. How long you been working with dinosaurs? They brought me on a few years ago. How come I haven't seen you around the base? We keep the dinosaur team separate from base operations. Limit the possible spread of information. How smart are these things? They showed high intelligence early on, they can understand basic words but after a year, they became aggressive. What happens after a year? They pass us in size. This looks fresh. Oh, God, how are you so calm? I didn't always work in an office. You hear that? Yeah. Let's go. Oh, thank God! Did you get it? Yeah, we got it. It just kept coming back and dragging people out. Okay. It's all right. It's close. It's coming back! Stay calm. I can't let it take me too! Stay calm! - Move, move, move. - Wait! Hey, are you okay? - Ma'am? - Hello? She was just scared. Hey, hey, hey. Can you supercharge my gun like you did for yours? Hey. Yeah. Back at the lab, I just need my materials. Okay. We'll go back to the lab. Figure out the next step. While they're young, they won't roam far from their mother. Once they hatch, she'll want to get them to a more protected location. Get me eyes on that nest. Not one of them is to be let off this base. Colonel, um... this base... I'm not even sure anyone's left. Is there any movement on the monitors? Not in a long time. The barracks was a war zone. There was only one person left in the infirmary. How dangerous are the little ones? I don't know. They haven't been on this earth for millions of years. Is there anything else you can tell us about them? Anything at all. In the animal kingdom, great white shark pups are fully ready to defend themselves from predators. Get me eyes on that nest. I'll check the breakers. Colonel? We've lost power to this section of the base. It's all over the base. They've cut it. The dinosaurs? Affirmative. They're smart enough to figure it out. But not smart enough to realize it gives away their position. This is the building that houses our main power supply and distribution. Okay, so if they cut the power to the entire base, they did it from there. Probably trying to disable our fences and keep us from tracking them so that they can run. Yeah, that makes sense. That building puts out a lot of heat. Ideal for nesting. Okay, so we go there right now. We end this. The mom will stay close to the nest. But don't underestimate her. She's not just about protecting her hatchlings. She's a fierce predator designed to kill you. There's a brief window when she'll be immobile. What's the territory that they usually cover? Yeah, what sort of territory they have in the wild? We don't know from experience. The world looked very different when they were alive. Ballpark. From what we observed, they follow the social structure of wolves more than birds. Okay, so what's the territory of wolves? Up to a thousand square miles. Jesus, that's the size of Rhode Island. If prey is scarce, even bigger. It'll decimate the state. No, they'll decimate the country. Look, is there anything else you can tell us? Anything that would help at all? They do follow a clear social structure. The pack serves the alpha female. They won't leave until she does. They also learn very quickly, though. I mean, they developed communication faster than any animal we observed, faster than even primates. All right, well, it's good to know. I need you to get me eyes on that nest. We need to see how many of these little things we have running around. Yes, ma'am. Anything yet? Colonel... I just saw a little one run past. Headed towards the mess hall. I'm going to follow it. Negative. Eyes on the nest is the main priority. Copy. I'll head to the mess hall. I'll take care of it. Good luck, Colonel. She's gone. He must have dragged her back to the nest. This way. I hear you. That's food storage. Auxiliary generators would be right behind it. What type of food storage? Meat. Mostly. These animals eat a lot. Great. Come on out. Don't play games with me. Do you see the mother yet? I don't see any heat signatures. They would be there. Unless they're out hunting. Ramirez. Colonel, I want you to pull up your team immediately. Wait, what? What do you mean, General? There has been too much collateral damage. It's going to bury us. It's done. I've already contained the assets. No! Get out. I'm destroying the base. I'm burying everything. All of it. General... We're still encountering people on base. There could be more here. Please, sir, just give me more time. I know that I can do this. Look, we can destroy the dinosaurs. Let's save all of our work and all of our research. You even said yourself, sir, that this has the potential to save a lot of American lives. You have to think of the future, General. I'm giving you 30 minutes. Thank you, sir. Get me tactical air command. Ah! Ah! Where are you going? - Mess hall. - What, are you serious? That was Colonel Ramirez. The nest should be right here. Well, you can stay here, then. I'm going to help the colonel. I don't know what that means. Stop. Colonel? Those little shits! - Where are they now? - I got one. There were two others, but they ran away. Where is the one you killed? They ate it. What? I've never seen behavior like that. So we have the mother and the two kids. You didn't get the mother? We haven't engaged the nest yet. We came to you first. Yeah, well, I'm fine. I thought I was dead, but I'm not. I'm fine. These creatures are so hard to track. You know what the good news is? If they do get out into the wild, they can't reproduce on their own. They need science to inseminate them. I don't know if that's the best contingency plan, Colonel. We don't know the lifespan of these creatures yet. It could be months, years, decades. Typical Allosauruses live to be 30 years - Plus... - Plus what? They don't need science to inseminate. This just gets better and better. They can reproduce through parthenogenesis. They don't need traditional sperm to egg. That's what makes the females so valuable. We have to terminate three dinosaurs. We can do this. We have to do this. Where to? The nest. TAC. Air assets are clear for missile strike on predetermined coordinates. I say again, air assets are clear for strike. They should be over there. If we don't end this... what happened here will happen to the entire state and then the world. Hey, if something goes wrong... You run. What, and leave you two behind? Listen... We need someone to tell the people on the outside how to fight these things. Shh. Wait... If she's eating... she's distracted. We can do a surprise attack. Stay behind me. Jesus! Nice. Move! Move, move, move. We have to shoot it at the same time. - You ready? - Yeah. Shoot! - Down, down! - It's not working. Okay. Hey! Over here! Colonel, what are you doing? I'm completing the mission. Come and get it. Take cover! Get down! Okay. This is Badger. Copy. En route to target. Is everyone all right? All right. - Okay? - I'm good. Major, no one will ever know it, but you just saved the country. Thanks, ma'am. I couldn't have done it without my team. Target within visual range. Preparing to arm weapon systems and engage. Missiles armed and ready to fire. - Shit! - What? F-15. Greer called in an air strike on the base. General! Please tell me you're clear of the base! Cancel the air strike. We are not clear. I repeat, we are not clear. We have completed the mission. Hey! Firing missiles in 20 seconds. We are not clear, General. Cancel the air strike. Copy. TAC... Firing missiles in 10 seconds. Scrub missile strike. - Hey. - What are you doing? Maybe he has heat signatures on or something. - Hey! - It's not gonna work. I'm sorry. Scrub missile strike! I say again, scrub strike. Repeat command, you're breaking up. It's been a pleasure serving with both of you. And with you. I say again, scrub missile strike. TAC. Badger. Confirming missile scrub. I say again, missile scrub confirmed. RTB. Wait. Is it turning? Yes. Greer must have called it in. Hey, Carrie? You didn't happen to save any of that whiskey from Colonel's office, did ya? It's okay, I have another bottle hidden. Come on. I'll buy you both a drink. Sounds really good.
