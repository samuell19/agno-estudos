(DRAMATIC MUSIC) CLERK: "Katharine Teresa Gun, "you are charged with an offence "contrary to section 1, subsection 1 "of the Official Secrets Act of 1989, "in that you did knowingly and intentionally "disclose top-secret intelligence information "contrary to the said act." How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty? (BED CREAKING) (KATHARINE LAUGHING) - YASAR: What? - KATHARINE: The neighbours will hear. YASAR: Let's move over. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) - Better? - Better. FROST: (ON TELEVISION) And what about the situation of persuading the people? Because it's very, to put it mildly, uncomfortable to go to war with 73% against. TONY BLAIR: (ON TELEVISION) If people are being asked today, "Do you support the war?" My answer to that is we're not at war today. I think especially, obviously, if the UN pass the second resolution, as I believe they will if the inspectors carry on saying he's not cooperating, I think public opinion is in a different place. When your correspondent was saying the war is inevitable, war is not inevitable. It depends on Saddam. If he cooperates with the inspectors, if he says how much material he's got, if he cooperates fully with them, then the issue's over. But he's not doing that at the moment. Bloody liar. They're all bloody liars. You know, actually, I don't think they are. I don't think the weapons inspectors are lying. This and international terrorism are the two big security threats... - Want coffee? - No, thanks. FROST: We were told, we were given to understand that what these inspectors were gonna come up with was evidence of, uh, weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear. What we know is that he has this material. Oh, my God, we don't know that. We don't know that. I mean, he just keeps repeating the lie. You sure it's a lie? Saddam's a psychopath. Yeah, well, just because you're the prime minister, it doesn't mean you get to make up your own facts. FROST: Do you think you have the goods on him now? BLAIR: I've got no doubt at all that he's developing these weapons and that he poses a threat. - Be at the cafe by 4:00. - I can fetch you at 5:00. No, no, no. It's good. I'll get the bus. I love you. Love you. Hey, Katharine. (IN MANDARIN) Did you tell Mark to call me? Did he call you? Yes... Did he take you to dinner? (IN ENGLISH) Yes. You know he has a place in Devon. He wants to take me surfing with his dog. - Is that a bad thing? - No, it's a great dog. Okay. When was the last time you got away? Oh, don't know, three or four weeks ago. We went hiking in Yorkshire. Ooh. Shall we all go hiking together? Yeah, that would be lovely. With the dog? Mm. Oh! Oh, thank you. I'm starving. I've been here since 5:00 listening to a Russian embassy staffer trying to bribe a North Korean defector who's been downloading some kinky shit. - Very arousing few hours. - You're disgusting. (LAUGHS) It's for Queen and Country. MI6 thought the Korean was one of ours. I just proved he's not. GCHQ, 1. MI6, 0. Katharine. I need your Beijing report for the Foreign Office. They start trade talks next week. Yeah, on it. (MAN SPEAKING MANDARIN) (MESSAGE DINGS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SOFTLY) Andy. Did you get this NSA e-mail? Are the Yanks really asking us to dig up personal shit on UN Security Council delegates? "They want the whole gamut of info "that could give US policy makers an edge "in obtaining results favourable to US goals." Christ, they wanna fix the vote. "This effort will probably peak in the middle of next week "following the Secretary of State's presentation "to the UN Security Council." Powell's gonna argue for war. And they're gonna blackmail the smaller nations to make sure they get it. Fuck. Excuse me. Question. FIONA: Yeah. Uh, this NSA memo, our people approved it? Yes, that's why it's been forwarded. The Americans want us to help them get a UN resolution for war? By next week? It's a joint UK/USA operation. UKUSA. Right. Got it. Hey, ours not to reason why. Everything good today, Mrs Archer? Yes, thank you. Very good. Very, very good. I'll see you again tomorrow, yes? Yes. Thank you, dear. - YASAR: Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah, it's been a long day. I need ten minutes. Want something to eat? No. You working this weekend? Could we go somewhere, get out of town? Sorry, janum, I'll get next weekend for sure. REPORTER: (ON TELEVISION) Uh, a question for the President, if I may. What is the status, in your view, of any second resolution? Is it something that you think it's worth spending time and energy trying to assemble? GEORGE W. BUSH: Just let me, uh, reiterate what I just said. This is a matter of weeks, not months. Any attempt to drag the process on for months will be resisted by the United States. - Can we watch something else? - No, no, this is important. Secretary Powell will make a strong case about the danger of a armed Saddam Hussein and he will also talk about Al Qaeda links. Come on, there... there are no credible links between Saddam and Al Qaeda. BUSH:...really do portend a danger... - I'll turn it off. - No, no, no, no, no. Please, I need to watch this. I need to know what they're saying. I mean, yes. Yes, Saddam is a dictator, but he is not a religious nut. I mean, why would he risk arming Al Qaeda and have them turn against him? It doesn't make any sense! Fine, but yelling at the TV isn't going to make any difference. They can't bloody hear you. - Where you going? - To read a book. BUSH: You see, my-my vision shifted dramatically after September 11. I realised the world has changed. My most important obligation is to protect the American people from further harm. And I will do that. Thank you all very much. - Love you. - Love you. Don't forget to check in at the station. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Read a book. I'll be back by 7:00 latest. - Mr Gun. Signing in? - Yes, thank you. OFFICER: When will you know if you can stay? They don't say. Could be weeks. Could be months. You never know with immigration, do you? - I know. - Thank you. Hi, Jasmine, it's Kath. Uh, are you around today? I'd love to come and see you. - Kat! - Hi. Oh, come here. Hello. Targeting who? The UN Security Council. Particularly the non-permanent members who could swing the vote in favour of war. Jesus. Maybe it's time to quit. You know, they say if you stay at GCHQ for more than five years, you'll never leave. I've still got two to go then. So you've still got a conscience. (LAUGHS) Are you still organising against the war? Does GCHQ have a problem with that? - What? No. - Give me your phone. I've already taken the battery out. - I called you from a payphone. - Sorry. Go on. I just thought... if I could get you a copy of the memo then maybe you could get somebody to look it over. I don't know, a journalist, someone in the anti-war movement. Look, if the press think it's nothing, fine. At least my conscience is clear. Your conscience? Kat, you're asking me to collude in a breach of the Official Secrets Act. Some call that treason. I am not trying to overthrow my government. I just think if someone in the press saw it they might ask more questions about what the Americans are asking this country to do. ANDY: Hey, Kat, they're sending me and Dan to London to learn Farsi. Wow, Farsi. Congrats. - How many languages now? - Eight. She's a freakin' super spy. Andy, where's my Pyongyang report? - Uh, one more hour. - Yeah, just get it done. - When do you leave? - Two weeks. You'll have to come visit me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) FIONA: Is that the Foreign Office report? - Uh, it's a rough draft. - Well, finish it. Defence section needs extra hands. I said I'd send you over there this afternoon. Okay, will do. What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. The issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors, but how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's non-compliance before we as a council, we as a United Nations say enough. Enough. We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. Although Iraq's mobile production programme began in the mid-1990s, UN inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programmes. Confirmation came later in the year 2000. The source was an eyewitness. An Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. Hi. I'm gonna watch some football. Do you mind? No. Go for it. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) REPORTER: From the north, the south, the east and the west, from the left, the right, from the radical to the uncommitted, they came. Well, we can argue forever about the validity of opinion polls, but what surely matters today is that this proposed war by Britain is historically unpopular and the mother of all focus groups has descended... Hey, Martin. We're now doing some real reporting. It's huge. Police are saying over 500,000. Organisers are saying over two million. So it will be a million then? Well, it's everywhere. Every country. Biggest demonstration in human history. ED: Roger, I filed this story seven times. ROGER: And seven times I have told you I'm not going to print it. Ed, this paper supports the war. Your sources support the war, Kamal. All I'm asking is that mine be given equal time. - Fair enough. - Thank you. Well, what do they say, Ed? That intelligence is being manipulated to support an invasion that Bush Junior's been pushing for ever since Saddam tried to kill his daddy in '93. Oh, come on, your source is retired. My source is ex-CIA! He talks to agents every day and he's talking to me on the record! Named source! Christ! If you're gonna encourage a country to go to war, perhaps you should spend some time on the front lines yourself. ROGER: That is a cheap shot, Ed. ED: Is it? We're the press, for God's sake, not a fucking PR agency for Tony Blair. - That's enough! - All right! You, go back to the States. I want you to find me something from a source who hasn't already retired and then maybe I'll rethink it. You're doing a great job, but we just need some more... Yes, Peter. Fuck you very much. And fewer words! If I ask for 500, don't send me 3000! This paper needs to take its finger out of its arse and stop taking Tony Blair's press releases at face fucking value! MAN 1: Hear, hear. WOMAN: Abso-fucking-lutely. - Christ! - MAN 2: Yeah, too bloody right. Brighty, where's my piece comparing Saddam to Milosevic? I need 400 words. Yeah. It's not really a 400-word topic, Rog. Yeah, it is. We were right to intervene in the Balkans. - We should do the same in Iraq. - Iraq's a little more complicated. - You've got Sunni and Shia... - Oh, fuck Sonny & Cher! What is this? "I got you, babe"? Just give me 400 words the average reader will understand. Milosevic bad. Saddam bad. Just write the fucking story. Stop overthinking it. MARTIN: All right. That was helpful. Just write the piece as you see it, Martin, and we'll cut it down later if we need to, all right? Okay. Thank you, Peter. Sonny & Cher. (KEYS CLACKING) - (PHONE RINGS) - Martin Bright. YVONNE: (ON PHONE) I've got something you need to see. It's big, Martin, really big. Yvonne? Yvonne? Martin. So good to see you. In an underground car park? It's a little Deep Throat, don't you think? - There's no signal down here. - Right. Wait till you see this. - Who gave you this? - Can't say. There's no info saying who sent it. This could have been written by anyone. - That's who wrote it. - Well. Frank Koza. - Who the fuck is Frank Koza? - NSA. And this I know because the letters NSA have been written on the back with a leaky ballpoint. My source says the header wasn't printed to protect the recipients at GCHQ. When did you get it? - Two weeks ago. - Two weeks? I gave it to the Mirror first. Sorry. Jesus. Why didn't they run it? - They thought it was fake. - No shit. - Is your source NSA? - No. A friend of the recipient. - A good friend. - A friend of a friend? A good friend of a trusted friend. I'm sure it's real. - Then why don't you write the story? - Oh, come on, Martin. I'm anti-war. You're with The Observer. Just check it out. (PHONE RINGS) OPERATOR: (ON PHONE) NSA press office. How may I assist you? Yes, hi, hello there. This is Martin Bright from The Observer in London. Um, I'd like to arrange an interview with Mr Frank Koza. May I speak to his office, please? - I'm sorry, Mr Bright? - Martin Bright, yes. Yes. Who did you want again? Frank Koza, "Chief of Staff, Regional Targets." Mr Bright, I'm afraid we can't confirm the names of people who work here. Could you give me a little more detail about the story you're working on? Uh, well, no. That's something I'd need to talk to Mr Koza about directly, I'm afraid. I see. Well, then I'm afraid I'm not sure I can help you. When you have a little more detail, please feel free to call back. Yeah, well... Hello? - You rang the NSA press office? - Yeah. They have a press office. I thought that was a good place to start. But you didn't tell them anything? No, Peter. I just asked for Frank Koza. Because if this is real, you could go to jail just for having it in your possession. I'm not letting this go. It's too good a story. I agree, but if you get it wrong it will sink you, it will sink the paper. I'd like to get a credible intelligence expert - to offer a view on the language. - Yeah. And I thought you could run it by your MI6 contact. - I don't have an MI6 contact. - Sorry. I meant your tennis club friend. Sure. I'll take it to Admiral Wilkinson. Be careful. Before we risk a D-notice against publication I'd actually like confirmation that Frank Koza exists. Do you think it's authentic? Well, certainly, the... the words used, uh, "topi" for example... Few outside of the security apparatus would know what that means. What does it mean? "Target of primary interest." And this term, "QRC surge effort". That's NSA military speak for significant intensification of surveillance operations. And this, where they ask for "valuable information from accesses in your product lines." Product lines are intelligence sources. So it's been written by someone who's familiar with security speak, but that doesn't mean it's definitely NSA. True, but there are no obvious amateur mistakes. - Have you heard of Frank Koza? - No. Uh, Paul, if we, if we wanted to confirm that he exists... Oh, sorry. Uh, I couldn't help you do that. Yeah, but if we wanted to confirm that he... Well, my own sources wouldn't ever trust me again. Understood. Understood. (PHONE RINGS) - What? - MARTIN: Ed, Martin Bright. Martin, Christ, I just got back to DC. Sorry, Peter and I have something urgent that we'd like to run by you. Are you on speaker? We are now. Hey, uh... Peter, you need to tell Roger to publish what I'm filing. This paper can't be seen to be supporting a war that we should be doing everything in our power to expose as a con. A neocon giant fucking con! Ed, that's why we're phoning. We need your help. We have, uh, something that might corroborate these things you've been saying. Hey. Oh, sorry. - Do you wanna get lunch? - What? Lunch. Eat. Now. Yes. Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. It, um... This new BBC poll, it says that less than one in ten people think it's right to attack Iraq without a UN resolution. Which is why that memo was sent. They need to twist arms. ANDY: I don't think it will make any difference. Most of the world is against them. You wanna eat, eat. (PHONE RINGS) OPERATOR: (ON PHONE) National Security Agency. How may I direct your call? (MIMICS AMERICAN ACCENT) Hello, I'm returning Frank Koza's call. My secretary said it was urgent. I'm sorry. Who are you trying to reach? Frank Koza. Mr Frank Koza. Sir, I'm sorry, there's no one by that name in the directory, sir. Oh, well. That's odd. He, uh, he called me. I'm sorry, but I'll need an extension number. Do you have an extension number? Uh, nah. Is there anything else I can do for you? No. No. Thank you. Thank you. - You have a nice day, sir. - You too. Fuck off. So I read the, uh, weapons inspector's report. Oh, congratulations. That's more than most MP's have done. - Well, shit, that's depressing. - Mm-hmm. It is. Look, there are a few pre-98 chemical weapons which have yet to be accounted for, but inspectors said they found absolutely no evidence of an active chemical or biological programme. Correct. And yet Colin Powell presented clear evidence of mobile labs. His evidence may be based on poor human intel from an Iraqi dissident. Really? The dissident isn't our product and should not be seen as our product. Whose product is he then? Look, Peter, I didn't say this, but there is concern in certain quarters that intelligence may be being manipulated to take this country to war. So why don't you tell your journalists to stop being so bloody loyal to Downing Street and start doing their job? Okay. Okay, what if I had evidence that the NSA requested GCHQ to help monitor private communications of the UN Security Council delegates? - To what end? - Bluntly, to blackmail them into voting for war. I'm not with GCHQ. You're MI6, you're on the same team. How did you hear about this? A UN resolution for war would cover everyone's arse, wouldn't it? No more asking your team to sex up evidence of WMDs or to back-dodgy claims that Britain was about to be attacked by Iraq within 45 minutes. And no chance of anyone being charged with a war crime if it all goes tits up. What are you asking me, Peter? I'm asking if you can confirm whether the NSA instructed GCHQ to assist in spying on Security Council delegates? You know I can't answer that. To do so would put me in breach of the Official Secrets Act. To deny it would not. Well, I can neither confirm nor deny. Okay. Let's play. - Change ends, idiot. - Yes. Your serve. So the head of the CIA tells Bush it's a slam dunk that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. - A slam dunk. - Yes. - And that's not true? - No. Meaning Saddam definitely does not have weapons of mass destruction or he may not. Meaning the intelligence is sketchy at best and manufactured at worst. And Tenet knows that? I've no doubt he knows that. I was with the agency 24 years. I can tell you, folks over there are really angry about this. Why? "Why?" Because the majority of the analysts do not believe it's a slam dunk, but no one wants to hear that. Not even the press. - Sorry, Mel. - I'm sorry. I'm just mad as hell. Listen, I wanted to talk to you today because I think I might finally be onto something that... that really supports what you've been saying for months. I need to talk to a man called Frank Koza. He's NSA. Head of Regional Targets. You know him? I'm sorry, Ed. I can't give out that kind of information. - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. - I didn't wanna call. - How long have you been here? We're not supposed to be meeting. I know, I've just... I've been following the news and I haven't seen or heard anything for three weeks. Okay, well, I've given it to my contact and apparently, she's having a very hard time getting the papers to believe that it's not a fake. Oh, uh... Well, maybe that's okay. You know, I... Look, I mean, all of the polls said everyone's against the war anyway, and I... And I've just been thinking... Look, I... I think that I acted too rashly on-on impulse. I didn't think... Jesus, Katharine, is it a fake? - Of course it's not a fake! It's real. - Well, then just go home! Okay, don't talk about this to anyone, ever! Just... - Sorry. - It's out of our hands now. Sorry. The truth is, the whole document could be a fake. But we're satisfied the language used is real. - It's fascinating. - Yeah. Is this document actually in your possession? Well, if it were, I'd be in breach of the Official Secrets Act, wouldn't I? (BOTH LAUGH) So based on what might be in this document... - That you don't have. - That I don't yet have. But that you want to print in your paper. If you don't issue a D-notice against publication. Well, which I will most certainly do if I think that publication might in any way endanger the lives of British people or British forces. - Understood. - Good. (CHUCKLES) Go on. Would you say it were likely real or a forgery? What do you think? I think it could be a fake put out by the anti-war movement. Or by a foreign agency to embarrass the US. - Which agency? - The Russians. I mean, the French oppose the war, too, but I don't think they'd do this. I think you might be overthinking it as usual, Martin. - Meaning? - You tell me. Well, meaning it could be exactly what it says it is. You know, Martin, I believe that all information collected in the name of the public should be made public. The only question is, when? But in this case, I don't have the luxury of time, Admiral. Powell just made a very strong case for war. Yes, I see. I have also always believed that censorship, when called for, should be based on security issues alone. Not on whether a news report might embarrass a government. Thank you, Admiral. EDIE: (ON PHONE) Ed, it's Edie from the London office. I got a weird message for you from someone who wouldn't give his name. He said you should call extension 6727. Makes no sense to me, but maybe to you. 6727. Good luck. - 6727. - Bye-bye. 6727. 6727. 6727. 6727. (PHONE RINGS) OPERATOR: (ON PHONE) NSA. How may I direct your call? (MIMICS AMERICAN ACCENT) Hello. Extension 6727, please. 6727? 6727, yes. One moment. SECRETARY: (ON PHONE) Frank Koza's office. Hello, may I speak to Mr Frank Koza, please? - Who shall I say is calling? - I can't say. Just put me through. Yes, sir. KOZA: (ON PHONE) Hello? Mr Koza? Mr Frank Koza? Yes. Who's calling? Mr Koza, my name is Ed Vulliamy. I work for The Observer newspaper in London. I wanted to ask you about a memo you sent to GCHQ. Mr Koza? (LINE DISCONNECTS) - Do you think this is real? - ED: Yes, they put me through. - To Frank Koza? - Yes. And you spoke to him directly, right, Ed? Well, we didn't exactly have a conversation. Did you speak to him or not? Yes or no, Ed? Jesus. Yes, but he cut me off when I said I worked for The Observer. But you're sure that he exists, right, Ed? Hell yes, I'm sure! I said, "Mr Koza?" He said, "Yes, who's calling?" All right. Thank you, Ed. Try not to fuck this one up, Rog. - Fuck off. - You're welcome anytime. - KAMAL: Hitler Diaries. - What? I'm just saying it smells of a forgery like the Hitler Diaries. And, of course, publishing those cost people their jobs. Which is precisely why we're doing rigorous checking on this, Kamal. - Who brought you this? - Friend. - Someone from GCHQ? - No. Then who? - Yvonne Ridley. - Yvonne fucking Ridley! The woman who fell off a donkey in Afghanistan at some Taliban checkpoint! Arse over tit with a camera up her burka and then she converted to Islam after she was released by her kidnapper. None of which means she's not right! She's anti-war! She probably typed the fucking thing herself. JAN: Martin, you realise - the legal risks we'll be taking? - MARTIN: Yes. The last time we published anything like this, you and Roger almost went to prison. Jan, the last time our source claimed MI6 had funded an attempted assassination on Gaddafi. This document doesn't accuse anyone of doing anything remotely like that. No, it merely suggests that the US government with the help of Great Britain might try to twist arms and threaten UN delegates into voting for a war in Iraq. It's a hell of a story. Look, we know Koza exists. Beaver says the language used is authentic. And Wilkinson says that while publication may embarrass both governments, he doesn't believe that it poses a security risk to the British people or the armed forces. Ironically, publication may actually prevent a war and save lives. - Well. - MI6? Would not confirm but did not deny. Jan, where are we legally? Wilkinson may not issue a D-notice, but that doesn't stop - Special Branch from coming after us. - Thank you. Legally, we have a top-secret document in our possession. Look, Rog, don't forget we're getting detailed information directly from Blair's office. - Fuck off. - Well, he's right. Printing this kind of story would kill that relationship. Since when did this paper prioritise political access - over its own investigative reporting? - PETER: Yes. We have taken a position on this, guys. We support the war. Yes. We do. Fuck. ROGER: But Peter's right. This is a fucking good story. Thank you, Roger. Here we go. Wait, I'll come with you. I'm just going to go get some milk. Go back to bed. I'll bring you a coffee. Okay. - Hi. - MAN: Good morning. Hey. What's the matter, janum? What's going on? - Bravo, Martin. - Ah, there he is. Well done. (CHEERING) - Here he is! - Nice one, Martin. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Brighty, congratulations. Bloody brilliant. - Thank you. - What have you got for me next? PETER: Every major European paper is citing us and we've had calls in from CNN, NBC, and Fox. They all want to interview you for their morning shows when they wake up in the US. Any response from Downing Street? Oh, we got a call in, but they're scrambling. Martin, line 2. Martin Bright. Thank you. Thank you. No. Uh, no, the person who leaked it hasn't been identified. Why'd you do it? I just thought that they'd investigate. I never expected them to print the whole memo. Why didn't you tell me? Sorry, I... I think... I think I... I thought that you would try and talk me out of it. I didn't want you to. - My God, janum. - I'm so sorry. They don't mention your name? - I haven't told anyone. - Good. That's good. That's very kind. All right, thank you. Why don't you, uh, get in touch with your friend Tony, Kamal? - Ask him if he has an opinion. - That's not funny, Rog. - Martin? - Yes? NBC just cancelled your interview. What? NBC no longer wish to interview Martin. Did they say why? They just said, sorry, but they didn't think - they could fit you in any more. - Really? Brighty, reporter from Santiago. Thank you. Martin Bright. Ah! Uh, no. At this stage, we have no idea what information was gathered from Chile or any... - Peter. - Yeah? - Fox says that they have to cancel. - What? Why? Uh, yeah, Mexico is furious, too. Okay. Thank you. - Martin? - Yes? I've got a producer from CNN. Martin Bright. I see. No. No, no. No, no. That's all right. Uh, may I ask why? Yes, I stand by it. Of course I stand by it. The Drudge Report? Yeah. All right, okay. ROGER: What the fuck is going on? It's fake. We've printed a fake fucking memo from Yvonne fucking Ridley! Oh, you fucking idiot. There. You see it? Because the Americans did. "Favourable." F-a-v-o-u-r. Some English cunt has tried to fake an American NSA memo and you fucking schmucks fell for it. Wait, Martin, where's the original? - Where's the original document? - ROGER: Jesus. - American spelling. - What? The original has American spelling. And this is what I filed, see? "Favorable." O-r. Just like the original. Not o-u-r. And "recognize" with a Z, not an S. Who changed what I wrote? Who... Who changed what I fucking wrote? Come on, speak up! Who did this? Nicole, what did you do? I, um... I ran it through spell check. - Spell check? - Jesus. That's what I always do. I'm so sorry. Do not cry, Nicole. Do not fucking cry. Okay, well, we know that it's not fake. We go online, we explain what happened, - we call all of the networks. - Oh, stop it, Martin. Oh, fuck, Rog, it was an honest mistake. Don't be so naive. You're an American editor. What story do you put out now? That The Observer is doubling down on a fake memo? Or that the staff of this newspaper are really so colossally stupid! (SOBBING) It's all right. Would you like a cup of tea? FIONA: Someone in this building has betrayed their government and their country. Now, I'm sure it wasn't anyone in this division, but starting today Internal Security will be conducting interviews with each and every one of you. If you know anything or suspect anyone, it is your sworn duty to speak up. If you do not and you are found to have withheld information of any kind, you will be charged with a breach of the Official Secrets Act. (PANTING) You should see the file that tosser's got on me. - What did he ask you? - FIONA: Katharine! Come in, Katharine. - Katharine Gun? - Yes? I'm John from Internal Security. Please. (EXHALES) Mandarin translator. GCHQ for two years. - Yes. - And before that? I taught English to Japanese students. - Hiroshima, right? - Yes. Interesting. Did you, uh, visit the memorial? The peace memorial? To the people killed by the atomic bomb? Yes, actually, I did. It's, uh... It's something you really have to see. It's very moving. Compels one to think about the consequences of war, doesn't it? - Yes, I suppose it does. - Are you anti-war, Katharine? No. I... I think sometimes war is necessary. I see you lived in Taiwan as a child? - Yes. - How long did you live there? Ah, we moved over when I was three. Um, I came back to do my A-levels. Was that for most of your childhood, then? Yes. You had a religious upbringing? No, not particularly. But you were sent away to a Christian missionary school in Taiwan? Yes. Gave you a clear sense of right and wrong, did it, being in a mission school? - Oh, I think my parents gave me that. - (CHUCKLES) Did you leak the Koza e-mail? - No. - No? No. - But you read it? - Yes. I mean, it was sent to me, so I read it. What were your immediate thoughts after you read it? Ah, nothing much. It didn't really bother me. - It didn't? - No. Who do you think might have leaked it? - I have no idea. - No? - No. - No? No. Thank you, Mrs Gun. That's all for now. Eat a little. Please. They're bringing everyone in. One by one. You haven't said anything? Okay. Just eat a little. Everything will be all right. Eat. Hi, Fiona, it's Katharine. Um, I... I'm so sorry but I don't think I'm gonna be able to come in today. Yeah, I... I think I've caught a tummy bug. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. What'd she say? She said I should get some rest. Good. - She was nice. - That's good. Try and sleep. Sorry, I have to go. REPORTER: (ON TELEVISION) ...ask you about a report in The Observer newspaper in London, of a memo, uh, reported to be from a man who actually works at the NSA in which he describes a "surge in surveillance "of UN Security Council members." What's your response? As a matter of long-standing policy, uh, the administration never comments on anything involving any people involved in intelligence. - No, of course, you don't. - (MUTTERS) REPORTER: If you're a Cameroonian diplomat or a French diplomat at the United Nations, then you're gonna have to operate on the assumption that the United States is bugging you. FLEISCHER: No, it's a blanket matter of policy that we do not answer questions of that nature... - Hi. - Hi. I'm not indicating to you whether it's true or not true. Have you eaten? ...of policy that predates this administration. I brought soup. A bean salad. I'm gonna say it was me. The Americans are refusing to admit that the memo was real. - I have to tell the truth. - No. If I don't, then they'll get away with saying it was a fake. Janum, you did what you could. Now leave it alone, please! What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to keep lying forever? If you say nothing, they can never prove anything. They are questioning everyone at work. They're interrogating my friends. They're asking people to name names. - That will be over soon. - And then what? There will be a question mark in hundreds of people's files because of me. They will put you in jail! I have to prove it was real. Everyone at work knows that what the NSA asked us to do was illegal. - Nobody cares! - Well, I care! If I don't say it was me, then we'll go to war based on... on blackmail and lies. And I can't live with that. I won't. Janum, please listen to me. I work at a cafe. I took the job because I needed a job. But it's just a job. You did the same thing, remember? When you saw the advert, you said you didn't even know what the job really was. It's just a job. And you can get another job. You just need to keep your head down for a few more weeks until things calm down. Then you resign, you can get another job. Hey. (BOTH SPEAKING MANDARIN) Feeling better? Oh, yes. Just cramps. ANDY: On a diet? - What? - No cinnamon bun? Who's in there now? Nuri. Second time. Had him take a lie detector test yesterday. FIONA: Mi-Yung! (KNOCKS) I did it. It was me. Oh, Katharine. Leave us, please. Handbag. Rings. Necklace. Watch. Belt. Um, I don't have a belt. OFFICER: Take her through. Cell 7. MAN: I've found the passports and a couple of foreign books. Who are you? Where's my wife? I want to see her! Where is she? They can't keep me long. They haven't charged me yet. No contact, please. - Where are they holding you? - Downstairs. I'm okay. I promise I'm okay. I brought this. It will get cold tonight. Thank you. GUARD: Lights off! (DOOR OPENS) - Katharine Gun? - Yes. We're from Scotland Yard. Do you have a lawyer? No. TINTIN: There's a duty solicitor on call. She'll sit in with you. Your supervisor speaks highly of your integrity. She says this breach was a foolish one-off. Was it? Do you mean if I leaked anything else? No. - Do you intend to? - No. I've always been very proud to work at GCHQ. Until now. Yes. Until now. What were you employed to do? Well, I can't be specific. Be general then. I translated signals intelligence and I reported anything I thought might be of interest to my clients. - Your clients? - The Foreign Office. The Ministry of Defence. So, you work for the British government. - No. Not really. - No? Governments change. I work for the British people. I gather intelligence so that the government can protect the British people. I do not gather intelligence so that the government can lie to the British people. With respect, Mrs Gun, you're a spy. Yes. You gather information from people's phones and computers and you feed that to your clients. - Yes. - You eavesdrop - on private conversations. - Yes. And now you're upset at being asked to do that - to members of the Security Council. - Detective... I don't object to being asked to collect information that could help prevent a terror attack. What I object to is being asked to gather intelligence to help fix a vote at the UN and deceive the world into going to war. - Who put you up to this? - No one. But you gave the memo to someone. Who did you give it to? A journalist? Someone in the anti-war movement? DETECTIVE: Your husband? SOLICITOR: You don't have to answer that. No, I will answer that. My husband had absolutely nothing to do with this. He was briefly detained here, too, wasn't he? - Pending deportation? - Yes, he was. - And then you married him. - Yes. His paperwork has been resubmitted. - He signs in here once a week. - He's a Muslim. I'm sorry? He's a Kurdish Turk seeking permanent residence in Britain. And given what Saddam Hussein has done to the Kurdish people, murdering over 180,000 of them with chemical weapons, I can assure you my husband has absolutely no sympathy whatsoever with the Iraqi regime. They why did you leak a memo intended to help remove Saddam Hussein? 'Cause by attacking Iraq you don't simply attack Saddam Hussein, you attack a country of over 30 million people! And I cannot bear to think of the pain and the suffering that that will cause. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can bear it. SOLICITOR: Detective, is she going to be formally charged? That's a decision for the Attorney General. Lord Goldsmith will need time to decide how to deal with you. The custody sergeant will release you on police bail today. You'll be told to return to this station in approximately three months, by which time a decision on whether to charge you will have been made. Are you all right, janum? - Are you all right? - Yeah, come on. Katharine? I'm sorry. I deal mostly with petty criminals, drunks and drug addicts. If you're charged, you're gonna need someone with a lot more experience than me. - I see. - Have you heard of Liberty? They handle human rights cases, political cases, often for free. Well, um, I just wanted to be sure you knew that. - Good luck. - Thank you. Thank you. REPORTER 1: George W. Bush's patience with the United Nations has run out because they haven't managed to get those nine votes at the Security Council which would give them, what they call, a moral majority. That represents a real failure of American diplomacy. REPORTER 2: This is the man who's advising Tony Blair on the legality of war. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has, I understand, told the Prime Minister military action would be legal without a second resolution. But it's all down to interpretation. What is she saying? They have not got the votes but they're going to war, anyway? REPORTER 2:...arguing old UN resolutions don't count and war is illegal without a new one or a new threat. So the troops are in place. - Some UN inspectors are quitting Iraq. - (KNOCKS) Just how close are we to war? Fergus has been assessing the evidence. Fergus? FERGUS: All the signs are now that war is very, very close now... Hi. - Do you want to come in? - Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm all packed for London. I just, um... I just wanted to say, I think that what you did was amazing. - You do? - Yeah. A lot of us do. Really? Are they going to charge you? I don't know. (SOBS) God, Kat, I'm... I'm so sorry. Hey, you didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything right either. I better be going. Bye. (EXPLOSION) (EXPLOSION) BUSH: (ON TELEVISION) My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger. Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly, yet our purpose is sure. The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder. (EXPLOSION) We will meet that threat now. We should have got that memo out sooner. - We did what we could. - We fucking failed. BUSH: So that we do not have to meet it later with armies of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities. Now that conflict has come, the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force. We're so fucking naive. BUSH: This will not be a campaign of half measures and we will accept no outcome but victory. (CLAMOURING) I have to go. You want to come to the cafe? Work with me? I'll call you later. If we use the phones, they'll be listening. Let them listen. We have nothing to hide. You should contact those lawyers. Today. Please. (DOORBELL BUZZES) - JAMES: Hello? - Hi. Uh, it's Katharine. Uh, Katharine Gun. I phoned this morning. Oh, yes, Katharine. Please, um, come on up. (DOOR BUZZES) - Katharine? - Hello. James. Lovely to meet you. - Thanks for seeing me. - Not at all. I'm sorry about the decor. We like to say we focus more on our clients. This is Shami Chakrabarti, our director. - Hello, Katharine. - And this is Ben Emmerson. - Hi. - Hello. This was the only memo you took? - Yes. - No one suggested you take it? No. And you've never met Martin Bright? - No. - Martin called me last week. He said he didn't know who you were but he wanted us to be aware that you might need our help. Well, that was very kind of him. He said he got the memo from someone he knew but he wouldn't say who. Do you want to tell us who you gave it to? Look... If you don't mind, I would prefer not to say. I promised I wouldn't. Okay. When you met Yasar, he had already applied for asylum. - Yes. - Which was denied. Yes, uh, they said that there wasn't a significant enough risk of persecution if he went back. And that's when you married him? - Yes. - And did he pay you? Absolutely not. I'm sorry, I don't mean to upset you. It's just that your husband is Muslim and the prosecution will be looking for motive. My motive was to stop a war and save lives. I failed. All I've managed to do is put my husband's future at risk. And your own. In fact, by leaking information to try and stop a war, I'd argue that you chose loyalty to your country over loyalty to your government, your marriage and yourself. You had nothing to gain and everything to lose. I think that speaks rather highly of you. SHAMI: He's trying to give you a compliment. I see. JAMES: Part of our job is to try and anticipate what the prosecution's going to throw at you. Some of the people we meet are looking for attention, a way to elevate their humdrum lives. - Well, I'm not. - No, I don't think you are. Sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. We're here to help. And we don't have duress. She's adamant no outside agency put any pressure on her. Public interest? The public has a right to know when their government is lying. We cite the Falklands case when Thatcher lied about why she ordered the sinking of that... that Argentinian ship. - Belgrano. - Yeah. - Who was the whistleblower? - Clive Ponting. The jury acquitted him, didn't they? Yes, and immediately afterwards Thatcher had the Official Secrets Act amended to avoid being caught in a lie in the future. So since '89, the public interest is effectively whatever the government says that it is. We've got nothing. I have to think about it. Sorry, I have to go. I promised Anne a weekend away. If they charge her, we might have to plead guilty and ask for a reduced sentence. But she's young and principled. A judge might even think that what she did was morally right. Or crucify her as a traitor. Bye. - You sure he was following you? - He was staring at me. - Sometimes men stare. - Yeah, it wasn't that kind of a stare. - What kind of stare was it? - Yas, please, I'm scared. Okay? I'm scared. You know, for years, I've tried to be legal here. - I know. - Then why'd you do it? These arseholes got their war, anyway. Saddam's over. And you know what? - I'm glad he's over! - War is not over. Ousting Saddam is just the beginning. - What do you know about war? - I work at GCHQ. All you do is listen to people talking! You've never seen war! You've never smelled it! Never even come close to it! Yas, I understand why you are angry. It is my fault and I'm sorry. I am so sorry. But... but I watched Blair with his... his smug smile and his sterile speeches that tell us nothing of what it must feel like to be a child in Iraq right now. No, I'm not... I'm not sorry that I tried to stop him. I'm not. I'm only sorry that I failed. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Thank you for inviting us in. - What is it you came to say? - Well, there's been a development. - Am I going to be charged? - That I don't know. YASAR: Then why are you here? I gather you went to see a lawyer today. - Did you follow me? - No. Because somebody did. Well, you must know that after what you did GCHQ is concerned. I have a right to legal advice. TINTIN: Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that. When you signed on to work for GCHQ, you agreed to be bound by the Official Secrets Act for the rest of your life. I know what I signed, Detective. Mmm, then you know that it says here... in section 1-1... that "a person is guilty of an offence "if he... "or she... "discloses any information "relating to security or intelligence." This means that you cannot discuss anything with anyone outside of GCHQ relating to the document you leaked. Are you saying I can't talk to a lawyer? Oh, you have the right to talk to a lawyer. It's just that you cannot discuss anything to do with your work at GCHQ. Or the contents of the memo you leaked or how it came into your possession or who wrote it. All of this information is top-secret. So disclosing it to anyone outside of GCHQ, even a lawyer, would be a further violation of the Official Secrets Act, which could result in further prosecution and a much longer prison sentence. We just wanted you to be aware of that. So if I may not talk to a lawyer, who may I talk to? You should talk to your superiors at GCHQ. - Are you fucking joking? - Yas, please. Please. We should hear what the detectives have to say. They're just doing their job. Simply put, if you wish to tell anything to a lawyer or the press or anyone else, you first need to clear it with GCHQ. Detective, I leaked only one memo. I had good reason to do so and I intend to make those reasons public if I am charged. I will not talk to my lawyers again unless I am charged. Tell that to GCHQ. Are you grilling or smoking that fish? I am smoking. I've soaked the wood chips in water. I've got charcoal. I'm... I'm trying something new. - KEN: Hi. - Ken? - Hi. - Hi, Ken. Guess you're down here for the weekend. Yes. Just for the night. Yeah, me too. It's been a while. Mm-hmm. Would you, uh... Do you want a drink? Uh, no, thanks. Sally's cooking dinner. - Hello, Anne. - Hi. - I'm so sorry to intrude. - Oh, not at all. How's the new job? Well, it's, um, eye-opening. In fact, I wondered if I might ask Ben's opinion about a new case that my office has been asked to prosecute. It won't take a minute. Would you mind? How do you know that I met her? Security services are all over this. Mm-hmm. And it's not just a domestic embarrassment. The Americans are very unhappy. Oh, well, that is upsetting. Oh, come on, Ben, it's not funny. What she did was a deliberate act of betrayal. Look, Ken, we're not colleagues any more. We're on different sides here. I think she wants to be seen as some sort of cause celebre. But she swore allegiance to the intelligence services and when you do that you don't get to pick and choose what orders you'll follow. Following orders is not a defence to a war crime. Yes, but who is she to undermine the strategic objectives of a democratically-elected prime minister? Oh, come on, she's not selling state secrets to Moscow. She exposed an illegal attempt to secure a UN resolution for war which would have given Blair perfect cover for the bloody mess that we're in now. No, she should have kept her mouth shut or complained to her superiors. Now I've got a real problem with people who think that from some lowly position they can possibly see the big picture. So then you would never question authority even if you knew it was breaking the law. Ben, you can't blame me for being angry with her. We're at war. So I'm going to assign the best prosecutor in my office to bring this girl down, which shouldn't be difficult. - She's already confessed. - I appreciate your determination to make an example of her, but you shouldn't be here. Oh, come on, we're friends. I'll make my position perfectly clear. If you charge her, then I will defend her to the best of my ability. So let's go home and pretend that this conversation never happened. You're not working today? No. I have to sign in at the station. - Then we can go for a hike. - I want to see the sea. (PHONE RINGS) Leave it. (RINGING CONTINUES) KATHARINE: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, we're not in. Please leave a message. JAMES: Katharine, it's James Welch from Liberty. Uh, we should talk. Could you give me a call when you get this message? Hello? Oh, ah, Katharine. Um, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Uh, James, you know that GCHQ said I couldn't talk to you. Oh, then, well, the good news is we finally had the gag order lifted. We've agreed not to ask any questions about what other work you did at GCHQ. But what happens going forward isn't up to them. Your case is now in the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. They're going to charge you. We should meet next week. - Katharine? - Yes. Uh, okay. Yeah. I know that this is a lot to take in, but we will help you. Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you very much, James. Speak soon. EDIE: "GCHQ whistleblower charged." "Traitor or spy?" "Spy speaks out." "The spy who wouldn't keep a secret." "Who is Katharine Gun?" "Leak against this war." She's everywhere. What's your angle? Look. "Katharine Gun faces jail for exposing "American corruption in the run-up to war. "Now her celebrity supporters insist "it is Bush and Blair who should be in the dock." - Celebrity supporters? - Mm. Little tabloidy, don't you think? Hey, we're building awareness. How about Daniel Ellsberg? He leaked the Pentagon papers. I know who Ellsberg is, Martin. Of course, you do. Forgive me. Well, Ellsberg described it as... uh, "The most important and courageous leak I've ever seen. "No one else has ever done what she did. "Tell secret truths at personal risks "before an imminent war, in time, possibly to avert it." Okay, that's classy. YASAR: I'll be quick. (KNOCK ON WINDOW) Are you waiting for the tall man? - The dark-haired one? - Yeah. He was shouting that his wife was outside. - They took him. - What? They took him. Where is he? Sorry. Who are you? I'm Yasar Gun's wife. Where's my husband? I'm sorry, ma'am. He's scheduled for deportation. What? No. No, no. Uh, no, no. Look, look, there's been some sort of mistake. I need to see my husband right now. I'm afraid that's not possible. OFFICER: You can't go in there! Please. Please, please, please, please. Let me see him, please. Please, he doesn't have anything with him. He doesn't even have any money. OFFICER: I'm sorry. They've already taken him. KATHARINE: No, no. They won't say where. I don't know. Oh, God, James, I don't know what to do. JAMES: Katharine, I'm so sorry. I'm at The Hague. - Who's your MP? - I don't know. - Is it Nigel Jones? - Nigel Jones, yes. Yeah. Do you have your marriage certificate? - Uh, yeah, yeah, somewhere. - Right. Find it, and I'll track Nigel down. Of course, they're legally married, Beverly. I'm holding their marriage certificate. BEVERLY: (ON PHONE) I'm sorry, but his application to remain in this country has been denied. Mistakenly. He's complied with every directive your department's issued. Nigel, your constituent is accused of betraying her country. Do you really think we should be helping her husband? I think deporting her husband when she's facing a trial looks like state bullying. All right, I'll review his paperwork. Thank you. And please make sure he's not flown out tonight. I'm sorry. Best I can do for now. I promise I will pick this up first thing tomorrow. - (PHONE RINGING) - Hello? JAMES: We tracked him to Harmondsworth detention centre. It's a deportation centre at Heathrow Airport right off the M25. Go to the main gate and wait there. Uh, are they gonna release him? We have ministerial approval but no paperwork yet. There is... there is a possibility, he's already been put on a plane. - What? - Yeah, I'm checking. Just get there as soon as you can. GUARD: Out you get. Let's go. Move it. This is a mistake, sir. - This is a mistake. - Come on. Please. I need to call my wife. I must call my wife! (HONKING) GUARD: Next in line. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (AEROPLANE DRONING) Hello? (KNOCKS) Hello? (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? James, James, um, I don't know if I'm in the right place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, but it's 4:00 AM. There's nobody to talk to. Wait, wait. Someone's coming. Wait. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Are you okay? - You're okay? - Yeah, yeah. If they try and pull anything like that again then I want to go public. - Not a good idea. - Why not? Because people are fickle. Many will hate you. Your personal lives will be picked apart, your marriage will be interrogated. In fact, we think it will be best if Yasar was kept well out of this. You should probably not attend the trial. - I understand. - What? No. Janum, we both know the jury will prefer an English girl without an immigrant husband. You know what? That is ridiculous. We are married and we have nothing to be ashamed of. The shame is on them, not you. You don't need to risk your freedom to prove it. We should discuss how you'll plead. Not guilty. SHAMI: But you understand you confessed. I confessed that I leaked a memo in order to try and save lives. And we will use that argument to ask for a reduced sentence. If you do plead guilty, there will be no jury. You could be out of jail in less than six months. Given how badly the war is going, we think a judge is likely to be sympathetic. But I'd have a criminal record. JAMES: That is true. Which I would carry with me for the rest of my life into every... every job interview, every application for credit. - Yes. - And... I'm sorry. We... we would be conceding that no one in Intelligence can ever tell the British people when their government is lying. JAMES: Not when the lies are protected by the Official Secrets Act, no. I'm sorry. This is all a charade. I mean, if you're saying that I have to plead guilty because the Act allows absolutely no defence whatsoever, then the very idea of a fair trial is a joke. I'm sorry, Katharine, but the best we can do is ask a judge for leniency. Post Belgrano, there really is no defence to a breach of the Official Secrets Act. Except perhaps one. Katharine said it herself. She leaked the memo to try to save lives. But she still broke the law. Yes, but there are circumstances where you can break the law. It's only in situations of absolute necessity. - Necessity. Exactly. - Ben, you're reaching. Am I? What are the requirements for a defensive necessity? Imminent threat to your life or the lives of others. Yeah, and no other reasonable way to prevent loss of life. Yes, right, well, the invasion posed an imminent threat to thousands of lives. Katharine has no right to try and prevent a war authorised by the Attorney General. - Unless the war is illegal. - SHAMI AND JAMES: What? Wait, wait, so now we're going to put the war on trial? BEN: Yes. I believe that Katharine Gun tried to stop an illegal war. What she did was necessary to try to save thousands of British, American and Iraqi lives. Ben, Goldsmith specifically stated that the invasion was legal. He said so only three days before the invasion. What was his position before that? What was his advice at the time Katharine leaked the memo? - Well, we have no idea. - Well, I'd like to find out. Because Blair spent a lot of energy trying to secure a new UN resolution. I suppose. When Lord Goldsmith finally said the war was legal, his deputy legal advisor resigned. Yes, Elizabeth Wilmshurst. Yeah, that's right. - She resigned. Yes, yes. - SHAMI: But she didn't say why. She couldn't. If she did, she'd be charged under the Official Secrets Act. So I need to get a meeting with Elizabeth Wilmshurst. - She's not gonna go public. - BEN: She doesn't have to. All we need is a hint that Goldsmith changed his mind about the legality of the war. I'm sorry, Ben. There are two ways they could justify war. - We've only addressed one. - So what am I missing? - Self-defence. - Oh, come on. Does anyone honestly believe that this country was about to be attacked by Iraq? I do agree, but that's why they trotted out Powell. - To make the case for WMDs. - Oh. If it's true that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction that pose an imminent threat to this country, the war is legal without a UN resolution. How many people actually believe Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction? SHAMI: Well, they're still looking. We go down this route, we better pray none are found. I'm gonna get Elizabeth Wilmshurst's number. You've put me in a rather awkward position. I'm sorry, but thank you for seeing me. I think what she did took great courage. And she was naive, of course, but brave. And you were brave enough to resign. But not to speak out in public. Perhaps if I had, I might have caused more of a brouhaha. Sparked a proper debate. Can I ask you, uh, how did you resign? I wrote a letter. And in that letter, did you give a reason for your resignation? I restated my position on the legality of going to war. Which was? That it would not be lawful to use force without a new Security Council resolution. Um, did Goldsmith initially support your view? He did. He told Blair that if military action were taken, he expected the government to be accused of acting unlawfully. And was that a written opinion? It was a detailed advisory document. Right, so then would that have been his position at the time that Katharine Gun printed the Koza memo on February the 3rd? Yes. And then he went to Washington. Oh, really? - Well, who did he meet there? - I... I wasn't given details. But after that trip, his opinion changed. In nine short paragraphs, he said that the UN's authorisation for the 1991 Gulf War could be reactivated to legitimise a new war with Iraq. He told the Prime Minister what he wanted to hear? At best, he was persuaded to support a really fringe point of view. - Er, really fringe. - Yeah. (PHONE RINGING) - Martin Bright. - Martin. - Ben. - Ben. I took your whistleblower's case. Yes, I heard. Can I meet her? No, not yet, Martin. I don't want a media frenzy. Okay. When she's ready. Before some hack tracks her down. Come on, Ben, I broke her story. I'm on her side. Well, you can help by finding out why the Attorney General went to Washington just before the war started. Wait, Goldsmith went to DC? I'd like to know who he met there. Right. I'm on it. - And how is Peter? - Peter is in Iraq. Yeah, yeah, I know. I've been reading his articles. Listen, if he hears anything, even a hint that Saddam really did have weapons of mass destruction, then please call me. Of course. Can I ask why? Well, let's just say that if WMD are found, then defending Katharine will be a little more complicated. - I'll get back to you. - All right, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye. There's thousands of inspectors here from the US army, the British army, the CIA, FBI. MARTIN: And still nothing? No, no, not a fucking thing. Nothing. Anyway, some Polish troops found a cache of sarin gas warheads dating back to the Iran-Iraq war, but they were all empty. And right now, I'm standing in a glass factory and all they've found is piles of silica sand and soda ash. So, yeah. Things must be getting ugly in Washington. Well, you should talk to Ed. Maybe we could end up doing a joint piece or something. (EXPLOSIONS) - Peter, what was that? - No, no, no. It's just our guys detonating some conventional ordnance. - They don't wanna have... - Jesus. ...kids finding unexploded shit in the rubble. All right, talk soon. Take care. Yeah, all right, mate. Bye. - February the 11th. - MARTIN: What? ED: Goldsmith's in DC meeting with the attorneys for Bush, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice. - Okay, hold on... - But that's not the big story. The really big story is the OSP. The Office of Special Plans. Turns out when Bush wasn't getting the intelligence he wanted, Rumsfeld bypassed the CIA and set up his own intelligence unit. They fed raw unvetted intelligence to Bush and Powell who lied us into a war! Yeah. Okay, Ed. I appreciate that. But let's, first, try and help a young woman stay out of prison. Uh, you said Goldsmith met Bush's lawyers on February 11th. Who were those lawyers? "John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, "William Taft, Jim Haynes, John Bellinger." The attorneys for Bush, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice. Wow. They really turned up the heat. You know, I almost feel sorry for Goldsmith. Don't. He fucking caved when his country needed him most. - That's a great headline, mate. - It bloody is. (CHUCKLES) All right. - Print it. - Yeah. - Bye. - We'll share the byline. Bye. Nutter. MARTIN: Goldsmith was under tremendous pressure before he went to Washington. Our military were refusing to invade without a clear legal opinion from him that what they were doing was legal in case of a war crimes trial. Thank you, Martin. Very helpful. Well, no, hang on, hang on, hang on. Do you think you have a defence? - We're working on it. - Okay. - Let me know when you do. - Well, you'll hear it in court. - Come on, Ben. - Bye. - He's persistent. - He is. But it's your story and you don't need a media trial. We should request full disclosure of all legal advice given by Goldsmith in the year leading up to the invasion. Oh, he'll almost certainly refuse to comply. Then we'll subpoena Wilmshurst. Hell, we'll subpoena Goldsmith himself. And Blair, too. Ben, if we can't prove that Goldsmith changed his advice, we can't argue that Katharine tried to stop an illegal war. What then? - Then I'll be found guilty. - BEN: Almost certainly, yes. So... do you want to risk it all and ask for disclosure of the government's documents? Or would you rather plead guilty and hope for a reduced sentence? I think... we were lied into an illegal war. Let's ask for the documents. All right. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) You ready? No statements now, remember. Let's just get through those doors. (CLAMOURING) JAMES: Katharine, you okay? KATHARINE: Yeah. JAMES: Ben's already in the courtroom but he wanted you to meet Martin Bright. Uh, he's covering the trial. Katharine, it's an honour. I'll be in the press gallery. I hope that's all right? Yeah, uh, yeah, you... You took a... a real risk. No, you took the risk. I think what you did was extraordinary. I think what you exposed was extraordinary. All our institutions failed us. The government, the intelligence services, the press, they failed us categorically. Even my own paper supported the war before that memo. - Well, thank you for being here. - No, thank you. It's important what you did. It matters. JAMES: We should go in, Martin. MARTIN: Yes. Sorry, James. Yes. Uh, be strong. Katharine, you're... you're going that way. Uh, can I... Can I just have a moment? - Of course. - Thanks. You should leave that behind, ma'am. Uh, yeah, sorry, can I just have a second? Just... (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Janum? Hi. Erm, I'm about to go in. I love you. I love you, too. Uh, I'm... I'm gonna try and call as soon as I can. I wish I was there with you. I know. I'm so sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm so proud of you. So proud of you. Bye. Bye. GUARD: Miss? Sorry. I can take your bag. - We'll see you in there, okay? - Yeah. Your scarf and jacket, please. Okay, and then if you'll raise your arms. Okay. She's here. Right. Okay. Judge is ready. GUARD: Up you go. Are you Katharine Teresa Gun? Yes. I'm sorry. Can you speak up, please? Yes, I am. CLERK: "Katharine Teresa Gun, "you are charged with an offence "contrary to section 1, subsection 1 "of the Official Secrets Act of 1989. "In that between January 30th and March 2nd of 2003 "you did knowingly and intentionally "disclose top-secret intelligence information "contrary to the said act." How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty? JUDGE: Ms Gun? Not guilty. (PEOPLE MURMURING) Yes, Mr Ellison. Yes, thank you, my lord. My lord, in light of recent developments, the prosecution will offer no evidence against the defendant on this indictment. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) JUDGE: I beg your pardon? My lord, the prosecution will not pursue the indictment. JUDGE: Today? - No, my lord. - JUDGE: I'm sorry. Are you asking for an adjournment, Mr Ellison? ELLISON: No, my lord. JUDGE: You are saying that you do not wish to proceed at all? - ELLISON: Yes, my lord. - But the accused confessed. - Yes, my lord. - And yet you do not wish to proceed? ELLISON: No, my lord. JUDGE: I'm sorry. I find that extraordinary. Do you care to explain? My lord, the accused submitted an unusual defence. Yes. The defence of necessity. - Yes. - And? And we do not believe we have sufficient evidence to rebut it. Why not? She confessed. Because, my lord, the documents that we have called for would show that this country was taken to war illegally. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) And... And may expose the government to charges of war crimes. - That is absurd! - Is it? Then kindly hand over the documents that we have asked to see. My lord, the prosecution is not obliged. Indeed, it is not permitted to continue with a case if it does not believe there is a realistic prospect of a conviction. To do so would be a waste of taxpayers' funds. My lord, I am thankful that the charges against Ms Gun are being withdrawn and that the crown is suddenly so determined not to waste taxpayers' money. But surely, after months of uncertainty and severe distress, Ms Gun is entitled to know why the government is dropping this case? Indeed, the public is entitled to know. - CROWD: Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. JUDGE: Mr Ellison? Again, my lord, we do not feel we have a realistic prospect of a conviction. There is nothing more I can say. To be clear, you are withdrawing all charges against Katharine Teresa Gun? Yes, my lord. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) JUDGE: Ms Gun. You are free to go. (SIGHS) (EXHALES) REPORTER 1: In a startling about-turn, the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped its case against an intelligence... REPORTER 2: At 29, Katharine Gun was facing jail for breaking the... REPORTER 3: The last thing the government wanted within months of a general election was a big court case focusing on the legality of that war... REPORTER 4: The lawyers wanted the Attorney General's secret advice to Downing Street about whether invading Iraq was or was not legal disclosed at the Old Bailey. And who was involved in deciding whether today's case went on to a trial... REPORTER 5: First tonight, Katharine Gun walks free. In a dramatic about-turn, the Crown... REPORTER 6: So did the Attorney General put pressure on to stop the trial? Did GCHQ? Did the Prime Minister? No answers. Tonight we're simply asked to believe that there was no case to answer. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) REPORTER: Would you do it again? - Would you do it again? - I have no regrets. Yes, and I would do it again, yes. Caught anything? Not yet. You know, it wasn't my choice to prosecute. I was bound by the decision of the Attorney General. Why did you keep her in a state of distress for a year before you brought charges? The services wanted to make an example of her. If we dropped the case any earlier... what kind of message would that have sent? Do me a favour, Ken. Go and fish somewhere else.
