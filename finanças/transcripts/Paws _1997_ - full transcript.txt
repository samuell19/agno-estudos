Bye, princess! Bye, Alex! (INDISTINCT) Poof! ZAC: Once upon a time there was a dog, and the dog belonged to a man. The man's name was Alex and he came from a cold place, very far away. Some people said he was a genius, but all I know is he changed my life. And the funny thing is we never even met. (PAPA LOVES MAMBO PLAYING ON STEREO) (HUMMING) (BARKING) Dear God. (TYPING) PC. PC. You lake this to Susie, you understand? You understand? You give it to no one but Susie. Trust no one! (LOCK RATTLING) Quick, boy. In the cupboard! Hello, Alex. You're looking well. Aren't you going to greet an old friend? Where's the money, Alex? (TYPING) Oh! I think we're a little short. About a million dollars. (STAMMERING) It... It's... It's all there. I moved it.

(EXHALES) (WHINES) ZAC: And so the little dog set out on the last errand he would ever run for his master. Bui I didn't know any of this. At the time, I was eating pizza three blocks away. My family had only been in Sydney a week and I already hated it. Oh, I guess everyone has problems. (TIRES SCREECHING) (YELPS) AMY: You've hit something. STEPHEN: I can't believe it. Oh! Stupid dog! BINKY: What is it? It's a dog. Now stay in the car. Oh, great. I just didn't see him. BINKY: I made a coffin. He's not dead. Poor little thing. Stephen! I hope nothing's broken. Why is he wearing a backpack? I don't know. Here you go. How is he? Well, he's fine, I think. I'd better clean up that wound. Where's the antiseptic stuff? BINKY: I want to call her Nancy. * Nancy, Nancy, where are your panties ZAC: Uh, hello, he's a boy. * Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... (LIGHTER CLICKING) ZAC: What are you doing? Give me that. Don't touch my stuff. (WHIMPERS) ZAC: So that's how I met Alex's dog. He'd only been here an hour and he was already cheesing me off. I mean, the dog was a thief! I should have known he'd be trouble. Oh, and if you haven't figured it out yet, this is me, and I don't want a dog. (SIGHS) (MOANS) (DRIPPING) (SCREAMS) (YELPS) (GROANS IN DISGUST) Dumb dog! Happy birthday, darling!

It's so you can buy something for your computer. Wait till you see Stephen's present. You'll love it. Happy birthday! See? It's me taking you for a walk! Happy birthday. Thanks, Binky. STEPHEN: Happy birthday, Zac. It... Well, it's not much at all, really. What is it? It's a flute. (MOUTHING) A flute? What about... (TRUCK BEEPING) (SUZIE CALLING) Somebody expecting a boat? ZAC: The boat is Stephen's bright Idea. He's been building it since before Moses. In case I haven't mentioned it yet, he's the loser who married Mum. The little dork playing the trumpet is Binky. But Mum's the real trumpet player. She has to go for a job playing in a dumb function center, (PLAYING TRUMPET) All right! If I could play like that, I'd be living in New Orleans! You got some lips. Oh, she sure has. ZAC: The loser, of course, hasn't got a job. He just... Oh, man! They always do that! Zac, come and meet Susie, our new neighbor. Zac? Hi! Just popped over to make sure you're settling in all right. Hadn't been mugged or anything. ZAC: Great. The wacky neighbor. So, listen, do you need anything... Oh, no! I'm late! I'm sorry.

Why do you talk funny? Because I do. (BARKING) Zac, why don't you show Samantha your room? Hmm? ZAC: And thank you, Mum. SUSIE: PC, what are you doing here? STEPHEN: Do you know him? Sure, I do. SAMANTHA: Hey, boy, how you doing? SUSIE: Alex would die if he thought you were lost. We didn't know who he belonged to. (SNARLING) PC! ZAC: PC? What does that mean? Pretty confused if you ask me. SUSIE: What's the matter? What do you want? What is it that's up there? (BARKING) I think I'd better call Alex. He'll be beside himself. Where are the books? Uh, I've got a computer. Oh. That's okay, I guess. So, what does it do? Show me something. What's this? Um... That's the... For the disk drive. It's not supposed to be unplugged. Uh... Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

Just the way you told me to, Zac. Cool! And as for you... Mom! I'm going to tell Mum! Dad, put me back! Yes! (EXHALES) ZAC'S FATHER: You've got one more wish. Happy birthday, Son. (GASPS) Zac!

You know, the one you're gonna help me with? (GROANS) Well, you're good with computers. We need someone to do the sound and the lighting. I can't! Why not? It's easy. We're doing it in this really cool warehouse. (SAM CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Sammy! Hello! Sam? Sammy. What is it? Um... It's Alex. He's, um... What about him? There's been an accident and... He's dead, darling. (WHIMPERS) (SOBBING) Alex has died. How? Oh, Susie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (SOBBING) (WHISPERING) It's all right, darling. I'm gonna take her home. (WHIMPERING) You're gonna miss Alex, aren't you? It's all right. I'll take care of him. AMY: He's 14. Just give him time. Look, maybe if I fixed up the tree house he could... Is that a really daggy idea or something? Not if you install a fax modem. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Right. Look, you're doing fine. Just talk to him. (PC TYPING) COMPUTER: The rain in Spain falls menly... Monly... Mean... Huh? Mainly on the plain. Hello, Zac. It's me, PC. We need to talk. (THUDS) ZAC: Where am I? Ah! I remember. A talking dog. (SCREAMS) Howdy. Oh, my God. What are you doing? You're a dog. How can you... COMPUTER: It's quite simple, really. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking to a dog COMPUTER: Record and translate. Remember your computer program... Stop! Stop it! Stop talking! ...records a sound and translates a word. My computer program? COMPUTER: It translates any sound I make into English. I entered the dictionary myself. But you can't. Why not? (SCOFFS) Well, you're a dog. Thank you. Let me have a go. (GROWLING) I'm Fido. Sniff my bum. It's a dog thing. ZAC: A dog thing? Okay. All right. Keep calm. Of course animals can talk, or go to the movies. COMPUTER: Are you listening to me? ZAC: But something was bugging me. Zac? Was it something I said? No. It was the way you said it. Vocadjust. A hundred voices. Take your pick. COMPUTER: What are you talking about? You want to sound like a robot all your life? If we're going to do this, we'll do it properly. (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Let go. Let go. Give me that. Stop turning it. MAN ON COMPUTER: All right, enough already! This is getting really ridiculous. (SCOTTISH ACCENT) Hey! Stop! Stop that... That's exactly it! I've always wanted to sound like Billy Connolly. You sure? * You take the high road * I'll take the low road * And I'll pee in Scotland afore ye * (BARKING) Ah, the problem is you can't move away from the microphone, can you? (WHIMPERS) Unless... I've got an idea. I've got to get a few things. Now, keep your voice down. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello. COMPUTER: Susie, we need to talk. Meet me at the track tomorrow! ZAC: Got it! (DIAL TONE DRONING) All right, let's do it. ZAC: All we had to do was download from the main unit into a palmtop, which is now taken apart so that the Central Processing Unit can be fitted into a protective casing inside PC's backpack. This means hooking up a separate power supply, which then has to be contained and fed through speakers. (SPEAKING IN FAST FORWARD) ...sound card which is activated by a microphone attached behind a cool bow tie. PC: Cool? You've got to be kidding! I knew it! I knew it! They're laughing at me! Oh, no, they're not. You look really cool. Right. This is from a boy who tucks his shirt into his underpants. Come on! I'll show you the dog track. (WHOOPS) Come on, Calvin Klein, let's go! Like... How does it feel? Much better. Oh, you know, I mean talking. Oh, brilliant! When I think of all the things I could never do before! Shout, sing, run naked on the beach... Oh, that I've done. Zac, you've no idea what it's like. People always yelling, "fetch this," "roll over," "walkies." And half the time you just wanna yell back, "Get stuffed!" And never can! And Susie, I can talk to her myself! Oh, PC! Susie? Susie? I meant Sister Deidre. Don't be fooled by the habit, though. Smokes Havana cigars, drinks like a fish. Hello, PC. What a pretty tie. I've become pretty! I told you. We should've gone with the blue bow tie. So how'd you learn about this stuff? You know that dog they sent into space? That was you? No, but we've done lunch. He was a mate of my dad's. So, where's your old man, huh? Um... Well... He... He died. He got sick and died. Oh. I'm sorry. Anyway, he died and that's why I moved here. Stephen made us. It's pretty dumb, huh? Forget it. Oh, look! Look! It's Beethoven! From the movies. Oh, I must give him a sniff. Catch you later. Susie. Susie, where are you? Think, boy. (CLUNK) Samantha? Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, nothing. Just taking PC for a walk. Poor thing. Is he okay? Well, he hasn't said anything. You know, he hasn't barked. Um... He's fine. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Fine. Listen, I don't mean to bully you about the play or anything. Mum says I have to slop telling people what to do and try asking them instead. So, will you do it? Hi, Sam! Hey, Billy! My Dad's got a new bitch running on Saturday. Are you gonna be there? Sure. Can't wait. SAMANTHA: Billy's good with computers too. Well? ZAC: As if she didn't already know. PC: Susie. Oh, Susie. Where are you? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Uh-oh. (SNARLING) Big dog! Big dog with sharp teeth. Those pies smell worse than you, Sibelius. (WHIMPERING) No! No! Hold the gate! No! (GRUNTING IN FRUSTRATION) Mongrels! (PANTING) Where's PC going? I don't know. (INDISTINCT) Thank you. Isn't that your dad? He's not my dad. I got to go. Sorry. I'll pick you up at 3:00 for rehearsal. Hello, Samantha. ZAC: So, that's why you ran away. I'd know that smell anywhere. She always wears the juice of crushed lilies. Her name is Anja. Who is she? Well, I don't exactly know her. I mean... We... I've seen her at the track. She's a criminal. A criminal? (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Shh! Trust no one. What? PC: Come on. I think we'd better follow him. (BARKING) What are you doing? What's wrong with him? No, what are you doing with my disks? Nothing, I just thought you wanted some help cleaning them up. Well, I don't! They're my disks. All right. Okay. I'm sorry. Look, I'll just go. (SIGHS) Cleaning my discs! (SCOFFS) (BARKING) Are you all right? (BARKS) Don't let anyone near those disks! Understand? They're just disks. Well... What? What is it? There's something I should tell you. Just a minute. I'll close the door. (SCREAMING) Shut up! Shut up! Binky, shut up! Listen! PC: Zac. Zac! Go easy. She's just a kid. Let me handle this. Binky? Do you know what rabies can do to a dog? (SNARLS) (SCREAMS) (TRUMPETING) Binky! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Amy speaking. MAN: Hello, Brown's Hardware here. PC, you're a master, mate. BINKY: He's in here, Agnes. Okay, here he is. No, Agnes, you have to stand here. He's got rabies. Okay, PC. Talk. Go on. (BARKING) Not like that. Binky, what are you doing? Get out of here. I knew he didn't talk. But he does. He does! He's just a dumb dog! He not! Come on, PC! Talk! You're just a big, fat liar and I don't like you! Ow! (SIGHS) Oh, Binky. What did I just tell you? You can't tell anyone. If people knew, they'd take PC away. Oh, come on. Next time somebody pinches you like that, punch them on the nose. Okay? PC: Binky? I'm flattered, but Zac's right. And let me tell you, if anyone was going to squeal, it would be that Agnes. I've known Dobermans with kinder faces. I've got to go. Are you coming? No! I... I have to practice the Highland Fling! (HUMMING) * Why don't you take her off and leave me alone * AMY: Because I was just got off the phone to them. Now what did you order? STEPHEN: Nothing but some tools. And how much did this cost? $3,000. $3,000! Are you insane? Come on, Amy! This is why things like Zac's birthday get stuffed up. If I had a proper workshop... AMY: The kids need clothes! How could you be so selfish? STEPHEN: And I need tools. We're broke! I don't understand how you could even afford something like that. I see. So it's okay for you to do what you love... What I love? I wear a Sicilian peasant costume, and play That's Amore 10 times a night. It's more than I'm doing. Stephen. Now stop it! Cancel that order now. Do you understand? Yeah. Amy... Zac... Go to hell. Right on time! Are you okay? Yeah. Let's go. Wait for me! I told her she could be a fairy. This is going to be exciting! Yeah, right. Shakespeare, exciting. (SIGHS) Okay, Alex, lot's do it. That's what we need, more height Hey! (GRUNTING) Okay and up we go! Here we go. (GRUNTING) (YELLS) (TIRES SCREECHING) Uh-oh. (ENGINE STOPS) Oh, thank heavens. I've been knocking on every door. My car broke down. Could I use your telephone, please? Of course, yes. Come in. Come. The place is a bit of a pigsty but I think the phone is under this pile of washing... Yes, there you go. You took familiar. Have I seen you before? Oh, I doubt it. You go to the dog track? May I have a glass of water, please? Plenty of ice? Sure. Come on. SAMANTHA: Hi, guys! CARLA: Samantha, darling, did you bring that boy wonder? "My... My..." CARLA: Oh, you're an angel. Carla, this is Zac. Computer whizz extraordinaire. God bless you. (CHOKING) You have a beautiful daughter. Isn't she something? Children are such a worry, aren't they? Little devils, the lot of them. (SNIFFING) Are you still on hold? To lose a child must be devastating. One day so full of life, the next... Poof. But I expect Samantha stays out of trouble? How do you know her name? I can't bear this dreadful music. But, of course, any child can meet with an accident. Where is it, Susie? Where's what? The disk from Alex. How do you know about Alex? Where's the disk? I have seen you before, haven't I? Perhaps I haven't made myself clear? Oh, crystal clear. Now you listen to me. I don't know what you're looking for and I don't care... Just give me the disk. You go near my girl, I'll come after you with a baseball bat and I'll knock you clear from here to next week. Do you understand me? Susie, is it all right if I borrow this one? Poof. (SNARLING) Shut up! What's your problem? (YELPS) Well, you should go to the police. You can't just do nothing. I can look after myself. Susie! It's Cordelia's birthday. I think I'll give her a bath. Amy, I've gotten used to taking care of myself. I'll be just fine. Now, you go. Go. Make up with that gorgeous husband of yours. (GRUNTS) PC! Now look, this is not a bone! Let's go put it back, all right? (GROANING) (WHIMPERING) PC: There's got to be an easier way to do this. Bone Indeed! (SIGHING) SAMANTHA: Fairies, be gone, and be always away. So doth the woodbine, the sweat honeysuckle gently entwist, the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm. (HUMMING) 'Tis my lord, the gracious Oberon. (CLEARING THROAT) (GRUNTS) Whoa! But I do not love thee! (LAUGHING) Come, my sweet. Taste my lips. (YELLING) (SUSIE HUMMING) (SNIFFING) (SUSIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh! PC: Oh, baby! Mmm-mmm-mmm! (SUSIE COOING) PC: Woof! Woof! (PHONE RINGING) Messy Mutts Hair and Massage Salon. Woof! Woof! I need a job done. Can you be discreet? What exactly did you have in mind? No. no, no. Like, the second act begins in the palace, so you have to have something really big. ZAC: So Shakespeare was pretty cool. You get to blow people up and play sick music. I thought you hated Shakespeare. ZAC: And Samantha wasn't so bad after all. So, what about me? Do you think I'm going to be a famous actress? Yeah, sure, I mean, like, you're really pretty. Pretty good, I mean. (HUMMING) So, how come you left London? Mum and Dad got divorced. This is where Mum grew up. I suppose I miss home a bit. Do you? Alex used to say home is where you're safe. What's that mean? I guess it means somewhere people don't yell at each other. See this? Alex gave Mum this for Christmas. Hey! Can I have an ice-cream? Hurry up! I didn't bring my wallet. I'll pay for them. You go and order. There's a bank across the road. And that'll be $109.23. The Playboy special with backrub and worm treatment. Now, will that be cash or charge, Sweet Chops? Charge. Sending the money through now, Gracy. You old fox! (BEEPING) Insufficient funds! Oh, no! Hey! Sorry! More chocolate, please. More? Excuse me! Excuse me! Maple walnut. Maple walnut. No! Wait! Wait! Whoa! Whoa! (CAR BRAKES SCREECHING) (CARS HONKING) Do you accept returned goods? Zac! Zac, hang on! Zac, don't be such a jerk. So, you ran out of cash. Who cares? I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Mum, what's this? Mmm? Don't ask, I have absolutely no idea. All this arrived about an hour ago, including Trish here. A mysterious admirer for Cordelia. A Mr. Jock Russell. Well, we have no idea who he is... ZAC: Jock Russell. Like I wasn't gonna pick that! (BURPING) PC: Did you get a guernsey at the girl next door? Look at that, eh? Those hairy lips. That wet nose. I'd like to see a greyhound fix her up like that. You wee beauty! Oh! (GRUNTS) ZAC: Come here! PC: What're you doing? That's my leg! SUSIE: Sammy? You haven't noticed anyone hanging round, have you? Where? Here. A woman. Strange looking? (PC AND ZAC YELLING) There was this woman at the track. What did she look like? Weird. SUSIE: If you see her again, you take off like the devil is after you, you understand me? Why? Who is she? No one. She's no one. Just a nasty piece of work. PC: I warn you, I'm an expert at martial arts. My paws are registered with the police. STEPHEN: What's going on, Zac? Nothing. Listen, I've gotta go out for a while, and your mum's gone out to work, so I was wondering if you could pick up Binky from Susie's later. Sure. Thanks. I'm sorry I touched your disks before. Actually, l was kind of hoping you might teach me to use one of these things. I've always wanted to learn how to ski the Internet. ZAC'S FATHER: Hello, Zac. I won't be long. (SCOFFS) Ski the Internet? All right, listen, this is what we're going to do. We're going to follow Stephen. The only reason why you're still alive is because I need your help. And, PC, don't you ever steal from me again. (WHIMPERING) I'm so ashamed. PC: Uh... How am I gonna follow him on a bike? ZAC: You're gonna follow the scent. (PC COUGHING HEAVILY) PC: Did I happen to mention I've got asthma? Mush! (PC COUGHING) Left! Left! ZAC: No. really? PC: How am I doing so far, hmm? Look! Look! There, there, up ahead! He's gone round the corner. Go, go! I hate to be the one to bring it up, but is this as fast as this thing goes? Pull left here... (BOTH YELLING) PC: Oh, this never happened to Benji. Oh, no, no, don't worry about me, I'm fine! Oh, he's gone inside. (GROWLING) Mummy? (SNARLING) Ahhh! That's it! Run! It's the wolf! (WHIMPERING) ANJA: I think you'll find it's all here. Let me see. Fifty-one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Thank you so much for getting this together so quickly. (WHIMPERING) I'm sorry, Zac. I tried. Honest, I did. And I just think I'm going to get eaten. I mean, it's not like I could have helped. I mean... Oh! Oh, shut up, you coward! Run! Low-fat doggy treats, my eye! (COUNTING) Three thousand. (BRANCH SNAPPING) (BRANCH CREAKING) Ahhh! (BARKING) Ahhh! (SNARLING) ZAC: Let go! ANJA: Sibelius, heel! STEPHEN: Zac? Are you all right? ANJA: Do you know this boy, Stephen? He's my son. What's he doing here? I don't know. I guess he must have followed me. Well, you'd better keep him on a lead next time. This isn't the place for children. I should take him home. ANJA: Mmm. Haven't you forgotten something? Hmm? And don't spend it all at once. What were you doing here? ZAC: Nothing. Just taking PC for a walk. (MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO) Were you spying on me or what? Zac, if you want to know who that woman is, all you got to do... She's a criminal. (CHUCKLING) She's not a criminal. She lends money to people. People who can't get loans the regular way. (SCOFFS) People who can't get a job, you mean. I work, Zac. Just because... You don't work! Mum works because you won't get a job. She goes to work in some crappy bar and you... No, she works in that club because she wants to. No one's forcing her to. That's what she wants to do. It's not! She hates it! And she hates being here! STEPHEN: Did she tell you that? She hates Sydney and she hates the job! Did she tell you that? She didn't have to! I already know. Zac, look, I... I know you blame me for bringing us out here and I know it was hard for you to leave Melbourne and everything that reminded you of your dad. Don't talk about my Dad! He's got nothing to do with you. Okay, fine. At least he never made Mum work. All right! Now, that's enough! Now, I'm not your dad, and I'm not trying to take his place. Yes, you are! I'm not, Zac! Your dad's gone! Shut up! And I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry he's dead. I wish you were dead. Well, I'm not dead. I'm here. And I'm staying here because I love your Mum and I love you and Binky. I'm just sorry you can't understand that. I want to go home. We are home. Come on, I'm cleaning up that wound. Where'd your Mum put that iodine? ZAC: You should know, Dad. (WHIMPERING) STEPHEN: Give it a rest, will you? Leave it! It's just a cut! Pass me one of those bandages. (SIGHING) All right! Just let me do it, Zac! Oh, I'm fine! (ZAC GROANING) Zac! Just leave me alone! (WHIMPERING SOFTLY) Ever had one of those days? (GRUNTS) I'm sorry I let you down, Zac. I don't want to talk about it. I couldn't help myself. You see, it... It's that woman. I was trying to tell you before but... Oh! I said I do not want to talk about it. Hi, darling. I just came in to say... Say good night. Hmm. Was it really awful? Can I tell you a secret? I loved it. Isn't that ridiculous? There's all these big, Italian mamas dancing and me wearing this stupid dress and playing those dumb songs. And I've never had more fun in my life. (CHUCKLES) That's great, Mum. Yeah. Anyway, it's stupid, really. Goodnight, darling. Mum? Um... Mum... Did Dad... You know, did he like you playing the trumpet? Well, he was... He was busy most of the time. He had a lot of responsibilities. (PC WHINING) PC: Stephen may be involved in something stupid. But he is not a bad man. We dogs can sense things like that. There comes a time, Zac, when you have to let go of the past. You know what I mean? Right? That's what growing up's all about. Come on. You know? Yeah? AMY: Darling, hurry up! The play starts in an hour. It's up to you. You can sulk in your room, or you can get out there and do the play. (SIGHING) Give me one good reason. (BINKY LAUGHING) Well, how about that, Sibelius? I've been watching the wrong house. Fancy a night at the theater? (SIBELIUS GROWLING) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (DIALOGUES CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (CHILDREN CHANTING TOGETHER) ALL: ...our fairy queen! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) SAMANTHA: What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? My Oberon! What visions have I seen? Me thought I was enamored of an ass. (WHINING) OBERON: There lies your love. How came these things to pass? 0h, how mine eyes do loath his visage now. Silence awhile! Robin, take off his head. There lies your love. Ah, Titania! Music, ho, music, such as charmeth... (WHIMPERING) (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) (PC TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Music, ho, music. PC: Nobody panic! Well, maybe just a little. There's a mad woman on the loose! Whoa! Help, help! PC: Zac! Save me, Zac! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) PC: I can't see! I've gone blind! BOY: Whoa! PC: Men, women, children, and puppies to the boats! Sorry, Madam. (ALL YELLING) Stop it. Stop it! (INDISTINCT CLAMOR) (GIRL SHRIEKING) SAMANTHA: Stop it! (TIN CLATTERING) Samantha! I thought you did wonderfully, darling. Samantha, wait! Samantha, wait! It wasn't my fault. You made me look like an idiot! But I didn't mean to. Why did you do it? Because Toby kissed me? Is that it? Samantha. Do you know how hard I've worked for this? It's the only thing I'm good at, Zac. It isn't. It is. I'm not smart like you. I can't do all that stuff. I'm good at one thing, and you've ruined it. I'm sorry. I don't care if you're sorry. You know, the only reason I was hanging out with you in the first place was because mum made me. Uh-oh! Here we go again! You! PC: Easy! Easy! Don't follow! Sit still! ZAC: This time you've gone too far! There's a good boy! Come here! Now, just keep calm, Zac. Calm? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't throw you out of the window! (SPEAKING MOCK-ICELANDIC) What? Because I'm your friend. That's how you say it in Icelandic. Icelandic? I think you'd better sit down. It's time I told you the truth. That woman who came after me tonight, Anja? The thing is, I lied to you before. I do know her. I know her very well. (WATER TRICKLING) (CLICKING BUTTON) She and Alex were married once. In Iceland. Alex wrote computer programs. Anja was his assistant, but she never loved him. When I was still a youngster, Anja began stealing his programs and selling them. Alex found a million dollars in her bank account. Poor devil was crushed. Hmm. PC: So one night, when she was asleep, we took the money and fled. I thought maybe we'd be safe in Australia. Maybe Anja would forget about the money. ANJA: Hmm. PC: But Anja never forgot anything. ZAC: The first night you were here, you had a disk. That was it, wasn't it? So, what's on it? I don't know. A clue to where the money's hidden. But now she knows where I live. And she knows about you. We're all in a lot of danger, Zac. (FOOTSTEP) And that includes you, Samantha. (WEAKLY) I came to say I'm sorry... (PC PANTING) (SNIFFING) PC: She's coming around! SAMANTHA: Oh, my God! ZAC: What is it? Ugh! Dog breath. (COUGHING) What? Dog breath? I'm a dog! I'm sorry. Listen, Samantha... PC: What are you saying here? I have an odor problem? SAMANTHA: It's just that smell. PC: Me? PC! Why didn't you say something? I mean, we're supposed to be... Oh, my God! ...mates, right? You just keep talking. What was I supposed to say? PC can talk? "Clean your teeth," would have been a start. Listen, Samantha... You try eating raw meat twice a day. I know... You'll see. Oh, my God! Oh, come on, can you quit saying that? It's just so humiliating. Oh, my God! Samantha! Oh, my God! If you're going to sit there and say "Oh, my God," then you might as well go home. Right. ZAC: I know it's a shock, but we've got stuff to do, all right? You're not going to tell anybody about PC, are you? Not if you let me help you. Oh, don't look at me. I stink. Alex was my friend. Hmm. (SIGHING) All right. Fair enough. The first thing we've got to do is see what's on that disk. Got it! What? Gone! Oh, great! MAN: Take it or leave it. No, no. I'll take it. (MAN TALKS INDISTINCTLY) What, now? You're coming now? It's kind of late, isn't it? I mean... SAMANTHA: What does it look like? ZAC: It's a disk, Samantha. SAMANTHA: Gee, thanks, Zac. Can you hold on a see? Zac, what are you doing? I'm on the phone. Nothing. I'll check the kitchen. Oh! Told you I wanted to help you clean up your disks. It's beautiful. Yeah, well, um... I'm sorry it wasn't ready for your birthday. It got broken in the move and... (CHUCKLING) Is this your view of me, is it? (BOTH LAUGHING) SAMANTHA: Zac! You found them! Later. Zac? Zac, the disk. PC: That's it. That's the one! ZAC: "Just a short note to say thanks for everything. "This will take care of you and Sammy. "Special of the Day?" Steak and kidney. What? Mum's pies! PC: It's a puzzle! Of course! What are you both talking about? PC: Alex had everything in his computer. I expect... Look, give the gate a good hit! The Special of the Day... (GATE BUZZING OPEN) ...is the clue to find the password to find the clue to find the money. PC: Piece of cake. As long as you know his favorite pie. A note to follow so. SAMANTHA: What's the green thing? A ball? A lime donut? A pea, l think. A note to follow so. * Doe, a deer a female deer (PC HUMMING) BOTH: * Ray, a drop of golden sun * Me, a name I call myself * Far, a long, long way to run * Sew, a needle pulling thread * La, a note to follow Sew * Tea, a drink... ZAC: PC, I think we've got it. It's "la." The note to follow sew. SAMANTHA: So that's "la" and a "P." Lap. "La" and "P." Well done. The rest is in and under your nose. Bonne chance. (WHIMPERING) Zac, you know that stuff I said about Mum making me hang out with you? I didn't mean it. Oh, that's all right. I suppose I did sort of mess it up. PC: Ahem! Excuse me! Hello! What does it mean? Well, bonne chance. It's French. It means, "Good luck." Ahhh! (BARKING) Don't move. Get away from that screen, brat! Zac! Delete it! No! No, no, no, no! (BEEPING) (GROANING) Get back. (PC WHINING) PC and I are old friends. It would be a shame to have to hurt him. SUSIE: Sammy! Mom? ANJA: Hmm! SUSIE: Is that you, Samantha? (HISSES) Stop her! PC! (CAR ACCELERATING) PC! Are you all right? Where's the boat going, Dad? It's going away. Stephen! Where's the boat? Gone. Well, what are you doing? Well, I sold the boat. What? I sold the boat to pay off some debts. Stephen! We need your help. What is it? What's happened? Ah! This brings back memories. Me, relaxing with a drink, Alex, out betting on the huskies, and you, my little dumb friend, tapping away on that infernal computer. So, how are you, PC? Not as dumb as I used to be, you black-hearted she-wolf. ...and then she came in through the window... SAMANTHA: And Mum came up the stairs because Alex sent her a disk. And... And she took PC. Because Alex had a million dollars. Wait a minute! (CHUCKLING) A million dollars! Yes! And if we don't find it, she's going to kill PC. I don't understand why you went to her in the first place. She came to me. Well, it was a couple of thousand dollars to kick-start my business. I need tools. The whole thing is supposed to be a surprise for Amy. Well, you weren't to know, I guess. And then she killed your friend, Alex. Hell. (PHONE RINGING) ZAC: That will be her. Hello. STEPHEN: Zac, give me that. ANJA: Hello. Hello? Stephen Feldman. So, have you got my money, Stephen? Well, you needn't worry. We... We've got it. Well, you'd better have it. You have one hour only. (STUTTERING) An hour? Yes. Sure. Oh, one more thing. No, no, no. You touch that dog or anyone in my family, and I'll kill you myself. You told her we had the money, didn't you? Let's go get your dog. Apparently, they have my money. You know, I'm glad you can talk, PC. I miss a chat. And we have a lot in common. Like leaving hair on the furniture? (LAUGHING) Like a sense of humor. I miss you, PC. (GRUMBLES) Sibelius doesn't offer much in the way of laughs. (SNARLING) Sibelius. Go, eat your bunny. (TOY SQUEAKS) (GROWLING) He was brutalized by rabbits as a puppy. Cute, isn't it? Go to hell, Anja! (GRUNTS) Get up. We're going to the track. (COMMENTATOR COMMENTATING) ZAC: So Stephen comes up with this wicked plan. Hah! Who would have thought? Susie's got this bag of fake money in the pie cart, while Stephen waits for Anya. And Cordelia and I have to rescue PC. So, when do you hand me over? Hand you over? (LAUGHING) PC, a girl can't live off a million dollars forever. Think of yourself as my pension. The rest is in and under your nose. Bonne chance. The rest is in. The rest is in! (BARKING) Cordelia, shh! (BARKING) That's why he said, "Bonne chance," for good luck. Le lapin. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Rabbit! (SWEARS IN FRENCH) (PC WHINING) (SIBELIUS GROWLING) Well, here goes nothing. (SHOUTING) Hey! Ugly! If I had a face like that, I'd shave my bum and walk backwards. (GROWLING) Ooh, and it growls like a girl, too. Oh, I'm so scared! Oh, please don't open this cage and beat me up! You big wild thing. COMMENTATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, race five will be commencing in three minutes. Please place your bets now. I love that smell of sweating dogs. This is it? No, no, it's the money I owe you. My loan, paid back in full. (LAUGHING) Wow! Cab fare. Now, where's my million dollars, Stephen? (DOG WHINING) PC. PC: (WHISPERING) Zac! Over here! (GRUNTS) Hang on, PC, I'm getting you out. PC: Er... Zac? I've almost got it. Zac! Would you quit bugging me? Help. (SNARLING) Ahhh! (PC SQUEALING) PC: It's gaining on us! It's a huge hairy monster. Quick! Upstairs, upstairs! He's gaining on us! (SCREAMING) (METAL CLANKING) My feet hurt. (BELL RINGING) (DOGS GROWLING) And they're lining up for race five. And they're racing! (COMMENTATOR CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (SNARLING) No dogs near the food, all right? Took my best apron! (BARKING) There's a number four moved into first place and just watch that hairy greyhound go! He's in the last lane, and he's left the pack behind! He's streaking away like a mad lizard! All he needs is a blue tongue! He's out on his own, folks. Where's the rest of the field? Do we have a name for number four? He's like a runaway train! It's no contest... BINKY: Slow down! PC, I've worked it out! Is this your dog? It's lapin! It's French for rabbit! The money is in the rabbit! What are you talking about? I'm not talking to you! Well, then, who are you talking to? Oh, get your greasy hands off me, fat boy! (GASPING) SUSIE: It's all there. Hmm. Samantha, I've got to warn Stephen! He's at the pie cart with Anja. I have to get up to the commentator's box. How are you going to get up there? I don't know. Maybe I could... Whoa! Please let me live! Ahhh! Ah! Ted! Sorry about the window, but I need the microphone. You won't believe the day I'm having. Are you all right? (ANJA CHUCKLING) Do you take me for a fool? PC: (ON PA) Listen up! I have a very important announcement. The money is in the... (FEEDBACK OVER SPEAKERS) BOTH: The rabbit! The rabbit! PC: Rabb... What? Huh? Robot? STEPHEN: No, no, no. A rabbi! A rabbi's got the money! What rabbi? You've got the money! (GROWLING) Dam computer! (BEEPING) New fangled rubbish! It's okay, Ted! I'm back! The money's in the... (COMPUTER BEEPING) (HOWLING) The rabbit! The what? (SHOUTING) The rabbit! The rabbit? What rabbit? The rabbit. (GROANING) SUSIE: The money's in the rabbit! Of course I don't have any money! Do I look like I've got money? COMMENTATOR: We apologize for that interruption. The dogs are being lined up at the gates now. (HISSING) And hang on! Just a minute! There's something untoward happening down there! I don't believe it! There's a fracas on the park ANJA: I want the money! Stephen? ANJA: Rabbit! Mine! My turn! This one's for Alex, you old bag! COMMENTATOR: Oh! What a beautiful right hook! Oh, excellent! Mum! COMMENTATOR: Well, ladies and gentlemen, whatever it is, it's entertaining. Rabbit... Rabbit... AMY: Stephen! (ANJA MOANING) What is going on here? ...the rabbit. Bunny... I want my money, my money. Clear the way! There's a dog on a mission here! Make plenty of room! Sorry, fatso. Money! (BELL RINGING) (YELLING) Look! Look! The money's in the bunny! There's no money! Ooh! Go, go, go! (PANTING) Whoa! Oh, my God! Oh! (YELLING) Nothing but smoke. Lapin. It's French for rabbit. The clue said it was under our nose. It had to be the rabbit. No money! No money! SAMANTHA: My pin! It's broken! BINKY: What's a Hollywood? SAMANTHA: It's a place in LA. LA? Pin! Well, you don't mean that... LA-pin. Under my nose the whole time. (SAMANTHA GASPING) Wow! (CHUCKLING) You've got to be joking! (LAUGHING) Oh, my God! (ALL LAUGHING) Yes! Give me five! Yes! (LAUGHING) Oh, God bless you, Alex! Oh, for goodness sake, Alex, couldn't you have just written her a check? ZAC: Well, if it had been that simple, I wouldn't have met the best friend I ever had. And anyway, Alex loved a good story. As long as it had a happy ending. (SCREAMING) (CRASHING) (KISSING) (LICKING) Oh, Cordelia, let's go somewhere quiet and sniff something good like car tires. What do you say, blue eyes?
