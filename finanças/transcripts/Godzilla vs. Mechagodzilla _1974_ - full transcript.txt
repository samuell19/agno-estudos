What's wrong? Open your eyes! Nami! Grandfather! What happened? A giant monster will destroy the city and trample all who flee! What? A monster? So the old man and the girl are descendants of the royal house of Azumi? My big brother knows his stuff! - 'Course l do. l've been working on the upcoming Expo so long, l'm practically Okinawan now. Her prophecy was pretty scary. Here's the entrance to the Gyokusen cave. You have to find another guide. l have work to do. Got it. Thank you! See ya. lt's Shimizu! - We've been waiting for you! - Something happen? We discovered a strange cave. A cave? This is it. Let us get some pictures! Stop shoving. No one past this point till the survey is done. You there! Even reporters must follow the rules. Get back! Reporters? What's so funny? l'm an archaeologist from Shuri University. My name's Saeko Kaneshiro. An archaeologist? Amazing! This mural was painted by the ancient Okinawans. Ancient Okinawans? This is a mountain rising out of the clouds. And this is the sun. But what could the two suns mean? This one's a mystery to me. These are monsters. Two of them. Must be some kind of prophecy. Prophecy? This one here... looks like this thing. What is it? Perhaps King Caesar, the guardian deity of the Azumi monarch. King Caesar? The royal house of Azumi has a legend. Long ago, mainlanders came here to Okinawa. They tried to destroy the house of Azumi. But a monster appeared, gleaming like copper, and saved the royals and their subjects. lts name was King Caesar. "A black mountain... will appear in the sky. And when it does..." Mr. Shimizu! You're going to Tokyo too? - Yeah. First vacation in years. And you? l'm taking this. l've deciphered the mural... but this statue is still a mystery. l plan to ask Professor Wagura at Johoku University for help. Professor Wakura? Of course. He's a world-renowned archaeologist, isn't he? Excuse me, but who are you? A freelance reporter... though some might call me a muckraker. Joking aside, l'm interested in that statue too. A scoop on that little guy could really pay off. l hope you'll keep me in mind. Look at those clouds! lt looks like a black Mount Fuji. "When the black mountain rises above the clouds... a great monster will come forth and destroy the world." Part of the prophecy from the mural. The mural? The prophecy continues: "But when the red moon sets... and the sun rises in the west... two monsters will join forces to save the world." A giant monster will destroy the city and trample all who flee! Thanks for keeping me company. Here you are. No, really. l'll be fine now. Hey! - Keisuke. - Hello, Uncle. l brought you a visitor. That was so mean! You could have said Professor Wakura was your uncle! Sorry. Just having some fun. You're awful! Uncle, where's Masahiko? He found a strange piece of metal in an Okinawan cave. He took it to Professor Miyajima's lab. Just as l thought. lt's some sort of space titanium. Space titanium? So it came from outer space? Earthquake! That's ten days straight, isn't it, Father? More on the recent earthquakes. The tremor measuring two on the seismic intensity scale that began near Cape Nemuro, Hokkaido, is moving steadily south toward the Tohoku region. No one knows what's behind this moving tremor. Some say a huge creature is burrowing underground - Next. These murals are very strange... yet l know l've seen them before. Professor, you should get some sleep. lt's okay. l'm fine. Could you get me some coffee? Sure. Make it strong. Give me that statue! - Professor! - Take this and run! Keisuke! Are you okay? Professor, it's Godzilla! "When the black mountain rises above the clouds, a great monster will come forth and destroy the world." The ancient prophecy is coming true. Yes, but l never imagined it would be Godzilla. Uncle, l have to go. - Where? - Gotenba. l'm worried about Professor Miyajima and my brother. lt's dangerous! lt's a war zone by now! l have to at least try. Nami! What's wrong, Grandfather? A monster! Godzilla has appeared on the mainland just like you foretold! The only one who can defeat Godzilla is our own King Caesar! But the mystery... has yet to be unraveled. Godzilla! Wreak vengeance upon the mainlanders, those who sought to destroy the royal house of Azumi. Godzilla! Anguirus attacking its friend Godzilla? lt doesn't add up! What a mess. l'm positive. lt's the same metal that Masahiko found in that cave... space titanium. You're right. lt looks exactly the same. Masahiko. Perhaps you'll show me that cave sometime soon. Let's go after Godzilla. l need a closer look. Sure. We can take my car. Unusual pipe. l made it in my spare time. The metal part contains astanopkaron. lf you separate the parts, it generates magnetic waves that can destroy positive and negative electrodes. l'll show you. Ready? Watch the oscillograph. That's some pipe! Two Godzillas? What's going on? l didn't expect the real Godzilla to show up so soon. The earthlings must be surprised. That explains it. The Godzilla from Mount Fuji is a cyborg. A cyborg? lts body is made of space metal. Mechagodzilla would be a fitting name. That's it! Anguirus must have called for Godzilla! Godzilla... you're mistaken if you think you're a match for Mechagodzilla. Now then... Commander, Mechagodzilla's head control stopped working. We can't proceed like this! We'll have to postpone our attack on Tokyo. Bring Mechagodzilla back to base for repairs. Masahiko! Let's catch the first flight to Okinawa tomorrow. Mechagodzilla must be under alien control. The space titanium proves it. Maybe we'll find some clues in the Gyokusen cave. Commander, the repairs will take a while. Sir, if we take too long... headquarters will learn of our failure! Don't worry. We'll find an earth scientist versed in space technology. l have it! Look here. These tattoos are hieroglyphs used by the ancient royal family. And the hieroglyphs carved here are a modified form of the same. Now l know where King Caesar slumbers. What's it say? "When the sun rises in the west... place this statue on the stone shrine at Azumi Castle." The stone shrine at Azumi Castle? So this... "When the red moon sets and the sun rises in the west, two monsters will join forces to save the world." That was the prophecy on the mural, right? The sun rising in the west... That's absurd. What could it mean? Tell agent R-1 ... to steal that statue at once. Now that they've solved the riddle, they can wake King Caesar at any time. He could rouse other monsters too. l doubt the aliens expected us to switch ships on the way to Okinawa. We outsmarted them. lncredible, huh? Further in? - Yes, this way. lkuko, watch your step. We've been waiting for you, Professor. Who are you? l command the force sent by Black Hole Planet 3 to conquer Earth. Space aliens, just like l thought. So you knew already? lmpressive. Mechagodzilla is our secret weapon for conquering Earth, but we lost control of its head. lt must be repaired quickly to keep our conquest on schedule. So we thought... we might call on the expertise that earned you a Nobel Prize. The answer's no! But Professor... Mechagodzilla uses cyborg technology developed by our scientists after a thorough analysis of Godzilla, Earth's greatest monster. You're a scientist yourself. Surely that piques your curiosity. - Don't touch her! - You stay here! Father! - lkuko! - Father! Professor! Father! Where are they taking them? Where? - The death chamber. Of course... there's still time to save them. l wonder how Professor Miyajima's doing. l hope they find some clues. Something wrong? l feel like someone's watching us. Really? What's wrong? l thought l heard Godzilla's roar. l don't hear anything. You're right. But l'm sure l heard something. Why are you after that statue? Answer me! Keisuke! The statue's gone! l chased the thief, but he fell overboard. With the statue? l don't like the way he fell. What do you mean? lt was like someone shot him. You're bleeding! Hello there. A fine night for romance. - Here you are. - Thank you very much. You said it was important, so l locked it in the safe. l'm in your debt. - How was your voyage? - Wonderful. Glad to hear it. Enjoy your stay in Okinawa. You made a fool of me. The stolen statue was a fake. "Deceive your friend to deceive your foe." Mr. Masahiko Shimizu has been gone two days. Two days? And Professor Miyajima and his daughter? They were with him. They said they might be gone a day or two. We've had no further word. lt has us worried too. l see. lt seems you're done with the repairs. Nice work. Please come down here. Mechagodzilla will commence operation at 6:00 a.m. A toast to Mechagodzilla's return. Release my daughter and Masahiko as you promised! You're right. l'll see to that immediately. Come with me. Professor! Father! lkuko! Masahiko! Enjoy your little reunion. lt will be your last. You had us worried. l'm glad you two are okay. Come over here. - Father! - Professor! Are you okay? Damn them! They're trying to cook us alive! - This is the professor's. - That's right. Who are you? An alien? Where are my brother and the professor? Tell me! You'll be joining them soon... as a corpse. Just who are you really? l'm with lnterpol. Nanbara's the name. lnternational police? That's right. We got wind of their strange activities six months ago. We cast a net to apprehend them... and you and your friends got caught in it. That's how l tracked you here. On your feet. Take us to your secret base. The heat! l can't take much more! lkuko, don't give up! lkuko, hold on! Open it. Alpha! Centaurus! Get back! Turn it off! Masahiko! Are you all right? Shimizu! Hurry! Let's get out of here! Freeze! Hands up. Now! Watch out! Hurry! Quick! This way! Professor! Just a bit further. My car's outside. Those fools. Wait! That's the third time you've saved my life. The third? On the ship too. Right? Look! The moon has changed color! A red moon... "When the red moon sets..." The prophecy's being fulfilled one bit at a time. Shimizu... l'm going back in there to take out those bastards. You head to Azumi Castle. - All right. Let me help him. Okay by you? - Fine. l'm going back in there. Even if it was to save my daughter... l helped those people. l made a pact with the devil. - You had no choice. You had to - - No. Only l can destroy Mechagodzilla's head control. Right, Shimizu? All right. ln that case... take this. lt may come in handy. l'm glad you found it. Thanks. - How are they? - Later. Let's get to the castle! Alpha! Centaurus. Hurry! - ls that it? - Yes. Hand over the statue... or these two die! Bastards! You brought all this upon us! We wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd left the statue alone. Shut up! Grandfather! Hand it over now! Saeko... let's give it to them. l'm Tamura from lnterpol. - So you and Nanbara...? - Yes, we're colleagues. Really? lt's two minutes to 6:00! Look! The sun! lt's rising in the west! So that's it! The sun rising in the west... is a mirage! King Caesar. Commander, King Caesar has appeared in Manzamo. So our agents failed to get the statue. Very well. First we destroy King Caesar. Launch Mechagodzilla! We're too late! We can still stop it by destroying the control room! Right! Let's go! Mechagodzilla... destroy King Caesar before he wakes! Where are you going? Let her go. King Caesar can only be awakened by a descendant... of the royal house of Azumi... and only Nami is left now. The dark shroud of night vanishes Dawn is breaking Time to wake from your slumber My Caesar! On the beach l wait beneath the fading stars Caesar! Come striding to me boldly over the blue coral And wipe the tears from my eyes My heart yearns for you l await your return The dark shroud of night vanishes Dawn is breaking Time to wake from your slumber My Caesar! Beneath the palm trees l wait Come to me boldly through the red deigo flowers Come grant my wishes My heart yearns for you l await your return Mechagodzilla, destroy him! l'm surprised to see you're still alive, Professor. But you mustn't underestimate us. Let's go! Please observe Mechagodzilla in action. Professor... l must thank you again for your help. Godzilla's still alive! The second monster in the ancient prophecy must be Godzilla! Godzilla's still alive? We'll have to teach him another lesson. Mechagodzilla, annihilate him! That's it! What's wrong? Mechagodzilla! Damn him! Godzilla turned himself into a giant magnet. Rocket engines, full power! On my signal, toss a piece of the pipe at each end of the control panel. Move! l don't believe it. Mechagodzilla, our greatest weapon, has been defeated. lt's gonna blow! Run! Wait! ls my father...? Don't worry. l'm sure they got out alive. Now the ancestors of the royal house of Azumi can rest in peace. THE END
