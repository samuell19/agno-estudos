Facts! What I want is facts. Nothing but facts. Facts alone are what are wanted in life. Plant nothing but facts and root out everything else. This is the principle on which your own master, Mr M'Choakumchild here, agrees, and on which I've brought up my own children. And it's the principle on which you will be brought up. Girl number 18. Who are you? -Sissy Jupe, sir. -Sissy? Sissy isn't a name. -My father calls me Sissy. -GRADGRIND: Well, he mustn't! What does your father do? He belongs to the circus. He looks after horses and other things. He's a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, a horse-breaker. Give me a definition of a horse. Girl number 18 unable to define a horse. Bitzer, define a horse. Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely, 24 grinders, four eyeteeth and 12 incisive. Sheds coat in the spring. In marshy country, sheds hooves, too. Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth. Girl number 18, now you know what a horse is. Very well. We're training you to be people of fact, who only live by facts mathematical and scientific, which are susceptible of proof and demonstration. This is a great discovery, children. A new principle of life. I intend you children to be models, just as my children are models of this exciting new world. Louisa? Tom? Is it you? LOUISA: Yes, Father. In the name of idleness and folly, what are you doing here? I wanted to see what it was like. What it was like? TOM: It's a rehearsal. GRADGRIND: Tom, though I have the fact before me, I can't believe you would have brought your sister to a scene like this. I brought him, Father. I'm sorry to hear it. It makes Tom no better and you worse. With the whole of science open to you, how could you bring yourself to this? I was tired. Tired of what? I don't know. What would your friends say, Louisa? I haven't any, Father. What will Mr Bounderby say? You know he's visiting us today. I hadn't shoes to my feet. I passed my day in a ditch and the night in a pigsty. That's how I spent my 10th birthday, Mrs Gradgrind. Not that a ditch was new to me. I was born in a ditch. A dry ditch, I hope, Mr Bounderby? No! A wet one, ma'am! [SCOFFS] A foot of water in it! That's enough to give a baby a cold. Cold? Oh, I was born with inflammation of the lungs. I was the most miserable little wretch you've ever seen. How I got through it, I don't know. But I'm a determined character, so here I am, Mrs Gradgrind. Yes, here you are, Mr Bounderby. I'm sure your mother meant well. My mother, ma'am? Heh. Bolted! She left me to my grandmother, who was the worst hag that ever lived. She could drink 14 glasses of gin before breakfast. She kept me in an egg box. What did you do? Became a vagabond. Instead of one old woman knocking me about, everybody knocked me about. [CHUCKLES] I learned to read under the direction of a drunken cripple who was a convicted thief and an incorrigible liar. But I pulled through, and became Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Banker, merchant, manufacturer. [CHUCKLES] Well, here's Mr Bounderby. Tell him. Now wait a bit, heh. What's the matter, Louisa? Father caught us looking at the circus. Mrs Gradgrind, they'll be reading poetry next. I wish I'd never had a family, Mr Gradgrind. Then what would you have done? Oh, why couldn't your children look at the shells and minerals and things? Why do you want to know about circuses? Haven't you got enough facts already? I couldn't keep half the facts you've got in your heads. Oh, go and learn something gological. Bounderby, I'm puzzled. My whole emphasis has been on scientific fact, reason. But it seems unreason's crept in, Gradgrind. Why else would they want to go and look and a bundle of circus vagabonds? I can't explain it. Perhaps they found a book of fiction. A novel. No, I've taken precautions. Of course, these circus folk are everywhere. There was one in school today. -A circus person? -Cecilia Jupe. Mrs Gradgrind, did you admit her? Is that wrong, too? She came to the house. She wanted to go to the school while she was here. You wanted girls to go to the school. -Yes. -Turn her out, sir. She could be a bad influence. You may be right, Josiah. Do it at once. No second thoughts. When I ran away from my egg box, I did it at once. No. We'll see the girl's father and then decide. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Ah, there you are, Louisa, young Tom. So this is where you've been hiding yourselves. [CHUCKLES] Calm yourselves. Never fear. Now, I've managed to square it with your father, and he isn't angry any more. Well, Louisa. I think that's worth a little kiss, isn't it? You can take one, Mr Bounderby. Always my pet, aren't you, Louisa? Goodbye, my dear. That's very good. What are you doing, Loo? You'll rub a hole in your face. You can cut it out with your penknife if you like, Tom. I wouldn't cry. Psst! Guvnor. [WHISPERING] Two gentlemen about Jupe. MAN: Squires. [CHUCKLES] Do you, uh... Do you know Mr Jupe well? Never set eyes on the man in my life. You never will, squire. He's gone, cut out. Do you mean he's deserted his daughter? Well, he was goosed last night, booed, booed the night before. Why? Well, he's all used up. He couldn't make people laugh no more. Eh, it's a hard thing, squires, 'cause he loved Sissy so, and it cut him deep knowing that she knew that he'd failed. Oh, this is good, Gradgrind. A man so fond of his daughter he runs away from her! Of course, my mother run away from me. I'm not surprised. But I call a spade a spade. And I call this man Jupe a rogue and a vagabond! It's all the same to us if he is or he isn't. But, squire, don't mouth it again in this place. Why did you come to see him? To tell him Cecilia Jupe was not a suitable pupil for the school. However, if her father really has left her... What are you thinking about, Gradgrind? Where is she now? Jupe sent her on an errand, so he could go quiet, like. I might have something to propose to her. SISSY: Where's Father? Father! Where's Father? Where's Father? Have you seen him? His clothes aren't there. Everything's gone. Mr Sleary, I can't find my father! He's gone, hasn't he? What will happen to him without me? He has gone! He has gone! He has gone! [CRYING] No, this is all a waste of time, no. Let the girl understand the facts. Girl, your father has deserted you. You must never expect to see him again as long as you live. [WAILING] Squire, we're very good-natured folk, but we're quick like in our actions. If you don't drop it, I won't answer for us! Let us just say Mr Jupe has gone away, and he's not expected to return. I am willing to take care of you, Jupe, and to educate you. No! Wait a bit, Gradgrind! You'll be an example to Louisa of what happens when unbridled imagination is let loose. Anyway, it's a sad sort of a business. I'm willing to educate and provide for you, Jupe, but you'll have to decide now. If you come with me, you mustn't communicate with any of your friends ever again. I... I'll put in my word, squire. Sissy, you can be apprenticed with us if you like. You know the nature of the work. We'll be your family and I'll be your father. Well, I don't pretend to be an angel, but, good temper, bad temper, I've never done a horse an injury yet. Someone help me. Jupe, I understand your father wanted you to have a sound education. When he comes back, how will my father find me if I go away? GRADGRIND: Mr Sleary will tell him. You'll have no difficulty finding Tom Gradgrind of Coketown. Let me go. Let me go before my heart breaks. [CHOMPING AND SCRAPING] You're not eating this morning, Mr Bounderby. I was thinking about Tom Gradgrind and that acrobat girl. No good will come of it. The little puss will get nothing out of such companionship. You're speaking of Miss Gradgrind? Yes, Mrs Sparsit, I was speaking of Louisa. Well you said little puss and there were two little girls involved... Louisa, Louisa, Louisa. You're quite another father to Louisa, sir. If you'd said I was a father to young Tom, you'd be nearer the mark. I'm going to take him into my office, ma'am. When he's finished his education? I never had none. You, on the other hand, went to the Italian opera -in satin! -[CHUCKLES] Come, confess it, ma'am. You were born in the lap of luxury. I don't deny it, sir. You were in crack society, hmm? Hmm. Devilish high society. It's true, sir. And now you are housekeeper to Josiah Bounderby at Â£100 a year. [LAUGHS UNPLEASANTLY] Jupe, when you're not at school, I'll employ you to look after Mrs Gradgrind who's something of an invalid. Oh, poor lady. From this moment, your history begins. You know, you're completely ignorant at present. Yes, sir. Very. Good. It gives me the chance to educate you myself. I've heard you've been in the habit of reading to your father. And Merrylegs. Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe. Dogs don't understand books. Now, what sort of books did you like to read to your father? About fairies and dwarves and hunchbacks -and genies and goblins... -That's enough, child. I can see I shall have to take you in hand, and the sooner, the better. Now, Jupe, what's the first principle of political economy? To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me. No, child, that isn't the right answer. Let's try again. Hmm, you've heard of national prosperity? Natural prosperity... National prosperity, Jupe. National. Now, let's say this room is the nation, and it's filled with 50 millions of money. Would you say this is a prosperous nation? I don't know. Fifty millions, Jupe. Why don't you know? Well, I don't know if it's a prosperous nation or not. Unless I knew who had the money and whether any of it was mine. No. Let's try again. Say this room is a huge town and it has a million inhabitants, and only 25 of them have starved in the streets in a year. What would you say about that proportion? I'd say it was hard on those who had starved, whether the others were a million or a million million. Tsk. No, child, that's not what I asked. I asked about the proportion. Oh. You want stutterings. Stutterings? Statistics. I always call them stutterings because they reminded me of stuttering, somehow. Yes, statistics. Let's examine statistics. Um... In a given time, say, 100,000 persons went to sea and only 500 of 'em drowned in a year. What is the percentage? SISSY: Nothing. Nothing. Nothing to the relatives and friends of the people who were killed. -[BELL RINGS IN DISTANCE] -MRS GRADGRIND: Mr Gradgrind. Mrs Gradgrind. Jupe... Jupe, I'm disappointed. Oh, Miss Louisa, I'll never learn. I try, but I'll never. I'd like to be you, Miss Louisa. Why? Why should anyone want to be me? Oh, but I'm so stupid. It's a hard thing being a politician, Josiah. I sometimes wonder if it's worth it. Now, wait a bit! You mustn't weaken, Tom. The Conservative Party needs you. It's grown soft. I see it all about me. My millhands expect to be set up in a coach and six and dine on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. I think turtle soup and venison's London fare, Josiah. MRS GRADGRIND: How will I get on when you go back there, Mr Gradgrind? The same as always, madam. And now you'll have Jupe. You've got healing hands, girl, healing hands. Mrs Gradgrind, do you know if Mr Gradgrind has had word from Mr Sleary or my father? He'd have told you if he had. He's not a man who withholds facts. No, Mrs Gradgrind. Mmm, that's a comfort. Louisa should do this, but she won't. I don't know what to do with the girl. I wish I'd never had a family, then they would have appreciated me. [DOOR OPENS] I can't sleep. I want to talk, Loo. What about, Tom? I'm sick of my life, Loo. I hate everybody except you. You don't hate Sissy, Tom. -She hates me. -She doesn't. She must hate the whole bunch of us. She's already getting as heavy as I am. As we are. I'm a donkey, I know. I'd just like to kick like one. Not me, Tom? No, not you, Loo. I wouldn't hurt you. I don't know what I'd do without you. I can't make you laugh, Tom. I can't make you. It's a great pity for both of us. You're a girl, Loo. Girls come out of it better than boys. You're a dear brother, Tom. I wish I could collect all the facts in the world and blow them up all together. When I go to work for old Bounderby, I'll enjoy myself. Mr Bounderby thinks like Father thinks. I know how to smooth old Bounderby. You're his little pet. When he says something I don't like, I'll say, "My sister will be very hurt, Mr Bounderby. "She's always saying how nice you are to me." That'll bring him around. Look at the sparks. See how they turn white and die. It makes me think how short my life will be and how little I expect to do with it. [TRAIN DEPARTING] I'm sorry I didn't see you coming home last night, Rachel. I missed you. It's all a muddle. She's come back again. -[CLATTERING IN BACKGROUND] -Ah, it's the looms, Mrs Sparsit. The sound of money, ma'am. [KNOCK ON DOOR] One of the hands to see you, sir. Stephen Blackpool. Oh, right, uh... What's the matter with you, lad, eh? It's not about money, is it, huh? You were never one of the unreasonable ones. Nothing like that, sir. Good. Well, then, out with it, lad. I've come to ask your advice. I married, Easter Monday, 19 years ago. She was a young lass. She went bad soon after. I remember. Took to drink, eh? Left off work, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, left you knee-deep in debt. I was very patient with her, sir. Well, more fool you. Eh, Mrs Sparsit? I tried this, tried that. She left me, she come back. I paid her to keep away from me. Five years, she's been gone. Last night, she came back again. Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in your ages? No, ma'am. I was 21, she was 20. I thought it might have been, the marriage being so miserable. I've come to ask, sir, how I can get rid of this woman. I can't bear it any more. You married for better or worse. If I hurt her, there's a law to punish me. Of course. If I left her, there's a law to punish me. Of course. If I marry someone else, there's a law to punish me. Of course. If I lived with another woman without marrying her, there's a law to punish us and every child that we had. Most certainly. Well, in God's name, sir, show me a law that can help me. Well, there is one, but you'd never be able to afford it. No, it'd cost you Â£1,500 or Â£2,000 to get rid of her. Not for the likes of you, lad. You've got her forever for better or worse. [BREATHING HEAVILY] RACHEL: She's sleeping now. The landlady came around for me at dinnertime, said she needed looking to. Why do it, lass? Because we were friends when we were young girls, and you were courting her. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I've to give her a teaspoon at three. -I'll do it. -No. It has to be done carefully. It's poisonous stuff. You're too tired. Oh, Rachel. Rachel. [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Oh, I need a drink. [BREATHING RAGGEDLY] -Stephen! -No, ahh! -[GRUNTING] -No! No! No! No! No! [GRUNTING] It's lucky I woke up in time. Aye. Lucky, lass. I've always been lucky. RACHEL: No, you're not lucky, but be thankful, she didn't drink it. So that she can recover and take my last penny and then leave again, then return again, then leave again. What's going to happen to us? We'll grow older, lass. We'll all grow older. Do you remember how we walked up these stairs to the study the first day you came here, Cecilia? Yes, sir. Cecilia, I must tell you, the result of your education has been a great disappointment to me. You are below the mark. I'm sorry, sir. I tried very hard. Yes, I believe you have tried hard. No fault there. I thought sometimes I tried too hard to learn too much. And if I'd been allowed to try less... No, no. You followed the system. I can only suppose you began too late. I'm sorry, sir. I wish I could have done better in return for all your kindness. No. No, I've no complaints. No complaints. You're an affectionate young woman, yes. And we must make that do. You've been a great help to Mrs Gradgrind and the family while I've been away in London. I sometimes think my being an MP was not an unmixed blessing. Yours is important work, sir. Thank you, Cecilia. I, um... I hope you've been happy here, and will want to stay. Yes, sir, until my father... Your father? You still hope he'll return? MRS GRADGRIND: Cecilia, come here, dear. I need you. Tom! Has Father said anything to you, Loo? No, he wants to talk to me tonight. He's been with Bounderby for hours. You are fond of me, aren't you, Loo? Yes, Tom. Though you don't come and see me often enough. You're always in my thoughts. You could do something. It would be splendid for me if... No, you'll find out soon enough. I can't stay. I have to meet some fellows. Loo, you won't forget how fond you are of me? I won't forget. Louisa, I've been talking with Mr Bounderby. Yes, Father. Well... You're a woman now, Louisa. Yes, Father. You look cold, Louisa. Are you ill? No, I'm well, Father. And cheerful? As cheerful as I usually am. Good. Louisa, I have something serious to talk to you about. Fortunately, I have complete confidence in your good sense. You're not impulsive. You view everything on the grounds of reason and calculation. Louisa, Mr Bounderby wishes to marry you. He wants to marry you. I hear you, Father. He, uh... He begged me to ask you. Father, do you think I love Mr Bounderby? I really don't know, child. Are you asking me to love Mr Bounderby? No. I'm asking nothing. Does Mr Bounderby ask me to love him? Well, it's difficult to answer that. Why, Father? Because the reply depends on the sense in which we use the word "love". Mr Bounderby wouldn't insult you by pretending anything sentimental, or expecting anything sentimental in return. So the word "love" may be a little misplaced. What word should I use instead, Father? You should only consider the facts of the case, not idle fancies. You are, in round figures, 20 years old and Mr Bounderby is in his 50s, so there is a gap between you in years, but not in income. The fact is, a large number of marriages in England are between men and women of unequal ages. In three-quarters of the instances, the older party is the groom. It's the same in British India and parts of China. You still haven't answered my question, Father. What word should I use instead of "love"? The word should never come into the matter, child. I repeat, you should only consider the facts of the case. "Does Mr Bounderby ask me to marry him?" Yes, he does. So the sole remaining question is, "Shall I marry him?" The rest, dear Louisa, you must decide. Are you looking at the chimneys of Coketown for an answer, Louisa? There's nothing there but smoke. When night comes, fire bursts out. I know that, Louisa, but I don't see the point of the remark. I've often thought how short life is. It is short, my dear. But various life assurance and annuity offices have proved that the average duration of human life has increased of late. I was speaking of my own life. Oh, yes. But I needn't point out, Louisa, that it, too, is governed by the same laws that govern all lives. What does it matter? What does what matter, my dear? The only question I have to answer is, "Shall I marry Mr Bounderby?" Certainly. Tell him I accept his proposal, Father. Are you sure, Louisa? Tell him I accept, Father. I'm pleased. Mr Bounderby is a remarkable man. Louisa, I must ask. Have you had any other proposal of marriage you haven't told me about? What proposal, Father? Who do I know? Who do I ever see? You've been so careful with me, Father. Thank you, Louisa. Thank you, my dear. You've always been my favourite. Mrs Gradgrind, allow me to present the future Mrs Bounderby. -Ahem! -Ah, there you are, ma'am. You wanted to see me, sir? Indeed I did, ma'am. Pray sit down. Thank you, sir. Are you feeling well, ma'am? Perfectly well, thank you, sir. Good, good. Mrs Sparsit, now not only are you a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman. Brace yourself, Mrs Sparsit. I am going to astonish you. I have smelling salts ready, should they be needed. I am going to marry Tom Gradgrind's daughter, Louisa. Indeed, sir. I hope you'll be happy in all respects, sir. Yes. Well, ma'am, I hope I will be. Well, naturally you do, sir. Of course you do. Under the circumstances, I imagine you won't wish to remain here, though you'd be very welcome. No, sir, I wouldn't think of it. However, ma'am, there are apartments for a born lady at the bank. You could look after the place on my behalf on the same terms. Is this a position that I could occupy without descending the social scale? Of course it is! Otherwise I shouldn't have suggested it to a lady who's moved in top society. Not that I care for such society, but you do. Say no more, sir. I know I shall never be freed form eating the bread of dependence. It's my lot. I accept your offer most gratefully. And I do hope, sir, that Miss Gradgrind will be all you desire and deserve. [INAUDIBLE] [TRAIN DEPARTING] All shut up, Bitzer? All shut up, ma'am. What's the news of the day? The millhands are a bad lot, ma'am. They're uniting to form a union. The late Mr Sparsit used to say these people must be conquered. It's time it was done once and for all. You couldn't put it clearer, ma'am. Mr Bounderby made 60,000 out of sixpence, so it stands to reason any man can make 60,000 out of sixpence. I've made sure I have only one mouth to feed, and that's the only mouth I like feeding. I believe Mr Bounderby did very well in employing you as office spy and informer. I'm grateful for the small gift he gives me at Christmas. The clerks are punctual and industrious, I trust, Bitzer? With the usual exception, Mr Thomas Gradgrind. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] MRS SPARSIT: Can I help you, sir? I left my servant at the station with my other luggage. I'm James Harthouse. I must say, ma'am, this is a very odd place. Is it always this black? It's usually blacker. You're not a native, ma'am? No, sir, it's my fortune for good or ill to be a widow. My husband was a Powler. A what? -A Powler. The Powler family. -Ah, yes. You must be very bored here. -I'm the servant of circumstances, sir. -Indeed. I have a letter of introduction to Mr Bounderby from Mr Thomas Gradgrind MP. I believe he married Mr Gradgrind's daughter. He had that honour. The lady is something of a prodigy, I'm told. Indeed, sir. Is she? Can you direct me to Mr Bounderby's house? Just tell the cabbie 22, Charter Street. Thank you, ma'am. I'm obliged. MRS SPARSIT: Who is that old woman? BITZER: I've no idea, ma'am. What did you think of the gentleman, Bitzer? Spends a great deal on his dress, ma'am. It's very tasteful. He looks like a gambler. It's immoral to gamble. Not immoral, Mrs Sparsit, foolish. The chances are always stacked against the players. There's no profit in it. He seemed to know something of Mrs Bounderby. Yes. Good news spreads. Mr Gradgrind informs me that the party is grooming you as his successor when he retires. I can tell Coketown isn't the kind of place you're accustomed to. No. See this smoke? It's meat and drink to us. The healthiest thing in the world [WHEEZILY] especially for the lungs. -[COUGHS] -I'm sure it is. You'll have heard a lot of southern talk about the work in our mills, hmm? It's the highest work there is, and the best paid. No, you couldn't improve our mills unless you put Turkey carpet down on the floor. And I'm sure you won't do that. No. As for our millhands, there's not a one in this town, man, woman, or child, who doesn't want to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. [SNIFFS] Loo. Uh, this, sir, is my wife, Mrs Bounderby. [CLEARS THROAT] Ma'am. An honour. You'll stay for supper. Well, don't deceive yourself. I'm a family man, Harthouse. I'm a genuine scrap of rag, tag and bobtail. I know the exact depth of the gutter I pulled myself out of [SCOFFS] better than any man. Yes, of course you would. I trust this won't put you to too much inconvenience, Mrs Bounderby. None at all, Mr Harthouse. I never learnt how to pay compliments. Your upbringing was different from mine, Harthouse. You're a gentleman. I don't pretend to be one. I'm not influenced by manners and such. Mrs Bounderby might be. She'll appreciate them, I dare say. Supper's eight sharp. I've some work to do till then. Mr Bounderby's a noble animal, quite free from conventional trappings. It's natural you should respect him. -Sherry, Mr Harthouse? -Yes. [CLEARS THROAT] Yes, thank you. You're going to help the nation out of its difficulties, Mr Harthouse. No. I'm not so vain. I've seen a little of the world, here and there, up and down. I found it all pretty worthless. I thought I may as well back the Tory Party as anything else. I respect your father's opinions because I've none of my own. None? I don't attach any importance to any opinion. Thanks to all the boredom I've endured, I'm convinced that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other and just as much harm. There's a charming Italian motto, "What will be, will be." It's the only truth going. Is that what you believe? I like a political party that thinks it can prove anything with facts and figures. It gives a man a chance to get on. Don't you believe in what the party stands for? Yes. But even if I didn't, I'd act as if I did. You're an odd politician, Mr Harthouse. There are more about like me than you think, Mrs Bounderby. In fact we make up the biggest party in the country, the Getting On Party. I'm just more honest about it. You can stay here with us if you wish, Harthouse. That's extremely generous of you, Mr Bounderby. Thank you. I'll show you around the town tomorrow, the streets where I was dragged up. I was brought up to make do with a hap'orth of stewed eels for my dinner, washed down with filthy corporation water. TOM: Sorry I'm late. When I was your age, I was punctual or I got nothing to eat. Well, you didn't have to dress and balance the accounts. Some people would think it a mighty privilege to be giving dinner and lodging by their employer. Mrs Bounderby, have I met your brother before? Could I have met him abroad? Oh, no. He's never been abroad. Have you, Tom? No such luck, sir. TOM: I do like your waistcoat, Mr Harthouse. -What an easy swell you are. -Call me Jem. TOM: So, how did you like a dose of old Bounderby? HARTHOUSE: [CHUCKLING] What a comical brother-in-law you make, Tom. TOM: [LAUGHS] What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby makes, you mean. HARTHOUSE: Oh, he seems a good enough fellow. TOM: You think so, do you? I never cared for Bounderby myself. My sister Loo, she never cared for Bounderby, either. But that's the past tense, Tom. We're in the present tense now. Verb neuter. Present tense. Indicative mood. First person singular, "I do not care." Second person singular, "Thou dost not care." Third person singular, "She does not care." Very droll. You don't mean it. I do. Loo never had a suitor. She's never even been courted. Oh, there's no surprise when Father proposed old Bounderby, she took him. She wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been for me. You? I persuaded her. I was going to be stuck at Bounderby's bank, and I knew if I got into scrapes, she'd be able to help me out. Very droll of you, and very good of your sister. Yes, it was. Of course, it was more important for me than for her. My getting on depended on it. It wasn't as though she left somebody else or anything, and staying at home was like staying in jail. Well, she seems to have settled down well enough. Yes. She doesn't mind. Girls get on anywhere. They always make the best of it. I suppose they have to. It's damn hard for the rest of us, though. [LAUGHS] Friend, you've seen how the mill masters have grown rich from the sweat of our brows. They've ground us into dust. We can't fight them alone. Only if we stick together can we get ourselves a better life. But now, you want to stand aside. We've called this meeting to give you a chance to tell us why. Let's hear from you, lad. I'm the only had at Bounderby's mill not to come in with you in the union. I can't. I doubt much that our coming together will do any good. Likely it will do us harm. But even if that were all, I would come in with you for good or ill. I have my reasons for staying outside. But what are they? That's what we're here for. I've given someone my word. I don't understand. You've given your word you won't join the union? Yes. -Who to? -I can't say. But why have you given your word? I've given it, and that's enough! [WHISPERING] Brother Blackpool, you know what it means if you refuse to join us. You know what we'll have to do. I know, brothers. You'll have nothing more to do with me. You'll not speak to me nor touch me. If I were lying perishing on the road, you would pass by me as if I was a stranger. Think on it, lad. I've thought on it, and I can't change, so let it be. Stephen, I've just heard. The word's out already. You shouldn't be seen talking to me, lass. Why didn't you join them? I promised you I wouldn't. Me? But that was years ago. I prayed with you in the chapel to keep away from trouble. Well, it happens you were right. You must join them now. Forget your promise. -No. -Why? Nobody tells me what to do! I won't be forced! You're wanted. Well, Stephen, what have these pests of the earth been doing to you, eh? Oh, this is the man I was talking about. -Oh, really? -STEPHEN: What did you want to see me about, sir? Well, to speak up and tell us about this union. I have nothing to say about it, sir. Would you believe it, Harthouse? Although they've put their mark on him, he's afraid to open his lips about them. I said I had nothing to say about it, sir, not that I was afraid to open my lips. Well, sir, may I take the liberty of asking how it happens that you refused to be in this union? I made a promise. Not to me, I'm sure. If it was just a question of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, you would have joined and made no bones about it? Yes, sir, I would. You hear, Harthouse, you hear? And he knows this union is just a pack of rascals and rebels. Are they rebels, Mr Blackpool? STEPHEN: No, ma'am. Not rebels. Not rascals. They haven't done me a kindness, but there's not a man Jack of them doesn't believe he's done his duty by his mates. Ah, and it's because they are so full of virtue that they've, uh, booted you out, is that right? You have to understand, ma'am, they are faithful to one another, even to death. Be poor amongst them, be sick amongst them, shed tears amongst them, and they'll be tender with you, gentle with you, Christian with you, and that's the truth. Thank you kindly, all. BOUNDERBY: Stop, sir! What do you complain of? I didn't come to complain, sir. I came because I was sent for. Then what do the people complain of, Mr Blackpool? Look how we live, and where we live, and in what numbers. Look at how the mills are always going and our only end is in death. Look how you're always right and we're always wrong, and still it gets harder and harder for us. Look on it, ma'am, and then tell me if it isn't all a fair muddle. But you, of course, are the one to set this muddle right. No, sir, no. But I know a strong hand won't do it. And I know letting us alone won't do it. You let thousands and thousands of men and women alone living lives like ours, and they become like one big, black world between you and the light. And, most of all, regulating us won't do it, like as though we were figures in a sum, machines without memories, without love or liking without souls to weary and souls to hope. You're a troublemaker. You came to see me before making trouble. You're one of the gold spoon brigade! You're such a troublemaker your own union won't have anything to do with you never. Well, I'll not have anything to do with you either. Sir, you know if I can't get work with you, I can't get work with anyone. BOUNDERBY: You'll finish the week off. You're fired! [DOOR SLAMS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] I wanted to speak to you after what happened. I'd like to help. Is this your wife? -No. -She's gone. I'm sorry. I heard about your troubles. There's something I don't understand. Why can't you get another job? The mill masters stand together, and he gets the reputation of a troublemaker. LOUISA: So you're cast out on both sides. It's because of a promise he made to me. I'll never break a promise that I made to you, lass. Never. -What will you do now? -Make the best of it. I'll work my time out here and then find another place. LOUISA: How will you travel? On foot, ma'am. What else? Oh, no, ma'am. Oh, no, that's too much. I'll take Â£2. I know I can pay that back. Goodbye. I'll catch up with you, Loo. A word with you, Stephen. I'm going to try and help. I think old Bounderby's treated you badly. Thank you, sir. I'll have a word with him on the quiet. See if I can't make him see reason. I have bit of influence. Better not say anything to anyone. If he finds out we've been talking... I understand, but I'll be off on Saturday. Yes. Better meet outside the bank Thursday or Friday after closing. I don't know exactly when. -LOUISA: Tom! -I'll be there in a minute, Loo. I can't promise anything, but... Remember, outside the bank. It's that millhand out there again. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] [TRAIN DEPARTING] Stephen! [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] You were going without saying goodbye. I thought it best, lass. Stephen, you know my heart. I feel like to die. I'm glad I found you here alone, Mrs Bounderby. There is something I would like to talk to you about. It's about your brother, my young friend, Tom. What about him? I have an interest in him. I'm surprised you have an interest in anything, Mr Harthouse. If you would have said that before I came here, I would have agreed with you. But I've changed. What about my brother? I know you don't want to hear this, but I think that young Tom has become a little wild, a little dissipated, wouldn't you say? Yes. Do you think he gambles? I know he does. And you make up his losses? Yes. He's borrowed a lot from you? When I married, Tom was heavily in debt. I sold some of my trinkets. It was no great sacrifice. They were worthless to me. But he keeps wanting more. There's one great fault in Tom I can't forgive, his treatment of you. What you've done for him demands his love and gratitude, not his bad temper. I'm going to try and make him change, if I can. Ah, Tom! What are you doing? Dreaming of some beautiful creature? No, not unless the beautiful creature had a fortune I could get my hands on. -You're mercenary, Tom. -Who isn't? Jem, I'm in a horrible mess. My sister could have got me out of it if she tried. You've already had money from her. How do you know that? She told me. Well, you have, haven't you? [SIGHS] Where else am I going to get it? My father wont lift a finger. My mother's never had anything except her illnesses. Loo could help me easily, but she won't. My dear, Tom, let me help you. -How much do you need? -Nothing. Nothing. I wish I'd known you sooner. In that case, there is something you can do for me. I want you to be kinder to your sister. -To Loo? -Yes. As a favour to me. I will. You see, you're the only creature she cares for. -My coat! My coat! -What is it? The bank was robbed last night. Tom, you go to the police! Out of my way! Josiah, I'd like to come with you. You look as pale as a ghost, my dear. It does you credit. My loss is your loss. Robbed. Robbed with a false key! How much? Well, not by so very much, but it might have been Â£150 Â£154, 18 shillings and sixpence. No interruption, sir. Don't forget that I was robbed while you were snoring. It might have been 20,000. -I suppose it might. -Suppose? Might have been twice 20 but for the fellows' being disturbed. -Is there a suspect? -Of course there's a suspect. When Josiah Bounderby's been robbed, there has to be a suspect. A millhand, sir. We saw him waiting outside. -Not our friend Blackpot? -Blackpool. BOUNDERBY: That's the scoundrel. And there was that old woman. Ah, the two of them in it together. It'll take time, but we'll have 'em. Huh? We'll have 'em thanks to Mrs Sparsit's sharp eyes. -Join us for dinner, ma'am. -Thank you, sir. Well? Well? What do you say, Mr Harthouse? Fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences. If there were no consequences, we'd all go in for banks. Don't be low, sir. Let me see you cheerful as you used to be. We'll try a hand of backgammon after dinner. I haven't played backgammon, ma'am, since you left. Ah, yes. Miss Gradgrind was never interested in the game. Oh. I'm sorry, Mr Bounderby. Sissy sent word my mother's ill. I'd like to visit her tomorrow with Tom. BOUNDERBY: Hmm. [CLEARS THROAT] I hope you don't mind. I was pouring Mr Bounderby's wine, as I used to. I'm sure Mrs Bounderby will be glad to be relieved of the trouble. Oh. That's unkind, sir. You don't mind, do you, Loo? Of course not. It's not important. [SCOFFS] You see, it's not important, ma'am. What's the matter? Have I offended you? Offended? How could you have offended me? I don't understand what you want me to do. Nothing! What could you possibly do for me? You're impossible this evening. Please don't trouble to explain yourself. It doesn't matter. [MRS SPARSIT CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY] Do you still take your glass of warm sherry with lemon peel and nutmeg, sir? No. I've got out of the habit. Oh. More's the pity, sir. You must let me prepare you a glass before I leave. You'd better stay, ma'am. My wife, it seems, will be away for a few days. Not that I'll notice the difference. Oh, dear! Tom, it's me. [SIGHS] What is it, Loo? Is it about Mother? We'll go and see her tomorrow. Tom, is there anything you want to tell me? I don't know what you are talking about, Loo. You've been dreaming. Do you think the man I gave the money to is a thief? I don't know. Go to bed, Loo. You're lying in the dark, Tom, so tell the truth. No one can hear us. Go to bed, Loo. I promise I'll help you, Tom. Just whisper in my ear. I've got nothing to whisper. Go to bed. Loo, go to bed. Very well, Tom. [MOANING] Are you in pain, Mrs Gradgrind? I think there's pain somewhere in the room, but I couldn't positively say I've got it. Don't leave me, Sissy. -Where are you? -I'm here. I'm here. Louisa learnt a great deal in this house. So did her brother. Ologies of all kinds, from morning to night. No ologies left that weren't worn to rags. But, Sissy, there was something. Not an ology... No, not an ology. ...that Mr Gradgrind missed or forgot. Yes, Mrs Gradgrind. I don't know what it was. I often sit here with you, Sissy, and think about it. Never get its name now. It makes me restless. You must sleep now. Mr Gradgrind will know. He'll know. [DOOR OPENS] Hello, Mother. Still on the sofa? Say hello to Tom, Mother. I only had a she-wolf for a mother. She didn't give me milk, only bruises. It must have been very difficult for you. Any news of the robbery? I'm going over to Kettely with Bitzer. The police may have a line on my thief. I'll be away for the night. Would you like me to keep an eye on the house? Mrs Sparsit will do that well enough. Oh, she's been uncommonly helpful. But, uh... [CLEARS THROAT] Look in on Loo. She'll probably want to grieve for her mother. Though I never did for mine, of course. I'm glad to see you, Mr Harthouse. Thank you for talking to Tom. He has changed. I'm glad, for your sake. [DOOR CLOSES] -I had to tell you. -Don't speak about it. You're my only hope. Before I met you, my life was a long desert, worthless. Bought my way into the Dragoons, bored. Trained as an English consulate, bored. Strolled through Jerusalem, bored. Sailed the word, bored. Now I'm trying politics, bored. Until I found you. -Look at me. -I'm afraid. Everything's worthless without you. We can't. I want to throw it all away, like dirt. No! Stay with me. Not here. Not in this house. Where? Not here. I've a room at the Coketown Arms. No one will see you. This evening, my darling, we leave tonight. Louisa? Louisa, what are you doing here? I want to speak to you, Father. You're soaked, child. Were you out in the storm? Yes. What is it, child? -What have you done to me? -Done to you? -You remember the last time we talked in this room? -Yes. -Why didn't you help me then? -I tried. Why didn't you neglect me as a child? You taught me to suppress anything from the heart, so I suppressed it, and in return, you gave me a husband I hate. Louisa. I have a hunger and a thirst on me. I must find a place where there are no numbers and no definitions. I never knew you were so unhappy. I always knew. But I thought my life would soon be over and nothing in it was worth fighting for. Well, you're so young, Louisa. Young and dead. I married, but I never pretended I loved him. I did it for Tom. He's the only tenderness in my life. What can I do? I've met someone. I don't know how, but he understands me. I'm just surprised he should care for me when he cares for nothing else in the world. He cares for you, Louisa? Oh, I haven't done anything to disgrace you, Father. But if you ask me if I love him or not, I think the answer is yes, perhaps I do. I do. Perhaps I do. Child. Child. He's waiting for me now. I don't know if I'm glad, sorry or ashamed. I only know your teaching won't help me now, Father. Find a way to save me, Father. Find a way. I'll die if you hold me. Let me fall! Down. Down. Down. You're on the last step down, my lady. How are you, Louisa? Better, Father. The ground I stand on breaks under my feet. I've proved my system, at least to myself, so I must bear the responsibility of any failure. Believe me, Louisa, I only wanted to do right. I know you only wanted to make me happy. I don't blame you. People say there is a wisdom of the head and a wisdom of the heart. I didn't believe it. I thought the wisdom of the head was enough. Did I disturb you? No. Would you like me to stay with you? Yes. Why have I always hated you so much? I don't know. I think you changed just before you left home. Do you hate me? No. Never. I've always loved you. Sissy, please help me! Confess it. You're bored already. [KNOCK ON DOOR] The young lady to see you, sir. Show her in, man. Come on. Mr Harthouse? Yes, the same. Do I have your word this visit is a secret? You have it, but I don't see where this conversation is going. It's about a lady. I've just left her. Where? At her father's. Ah, her father's. That's the way it is, is it? I must ask you to promise never to see her again as long as you live. -Did she ask you to tell me? -No. I don't doubt your sincerity, but I can't promise. There's no hope for you. Consider her dead. No. How can you take on such a responsibility on your own? I do it out of love. I know her character. Trust me, Mr Harthouse. For some reason, I do. I'm not a moral sort of fellow. I've never made any pretence. I'm as immoral as need be. But I never had any intentions of hurting the young lady or in taking advantage of the fact that her father's a machine, her brother's a whelp and her husband's a boar. I never had any evil intentions. I just did what I did without thinking. It seemed perfectly natural. I was bored. Will you give up seeing her? Yes. Why not? But I'd never have agreed if anyone else had come to ask. -There's one more thing. -More? I must ask you to leave her today and never come back. Come, come. Strange as it may sound, I'm here on public business. Well, political business for the Conservative Party. It's a fact. Fact or no fact, I must ask you to go. But it would make me look foolish just to up and leave. It's the honourable thing to do, and I know you'll do the honourable thing or else I wouldn't have come here. [SCOFFS] Honourable? I don't know what to say. I trust you, Mr Harthouse. This is ridiculous. [SIGHS] Well... There's no way out of it. What will be, will be. And this is what will be, I suppose. You have my word. I'll go. Thank you, Mr Harthouse. At lease allow me the privilege of knowing my enemy's name. My name? It's Sis. Cecilia Jupe. Are you related to the family? No, no. I'm just a girl from the circus. Ah. "Just a girl from the circus." [CHUCKLES] -[DOOR CLOSES] -[SIGHS] Another defeat. Another failure. It's one great pyramid of failure. What does it matter? I need a trip. Maybe up the Nile. Better write to my brother, Jack. "Dear Jack, "all up in Coketown. "Bored out of my mind. "Am going for camels. "Affectionately, Jem." -[DOOR OPENS] -Ah! Now, wait a bit. This lady here has something to tell you that will strike you dumb. Dumb! Bounderby, I want to speak. Not you, sir. Let this lady speak. Ma'am, tell him. Mr Bounderby, I... [SNEEZES] I can't. This is no time for swallowing marbles. If you can't spit it out, I can. Gradgrind, Mrs Sparsit overheard a conversation between your friend James Harthouse and Loo. She followed your precious daughter, my wife, to Mr Harthouse's hotel. And now they've gone! Together! Louisa is here. Yes, together. Here? Did you say here? She's upstairs, asleep. She came here last night in the storm. Naturally, she stayed overnight. [SNEEZES] Well, ma'am, we shall be pleased to hear whatever little apology you may have to offer. [HOARSELY] Sir, my throat. I need lemon juice. You need something else, too, ma'am. A coach to take you back to the bank. I'm sorry, Gradgrind. I'm not in an agreeable state today. Now, I have to speak plain because I'm a plain-speaking man. Your daughter, sir, has not been a dutiful wife to me. I doubt if we've ever understood Louisa. -What do you mean, "we"? -I, then. I doubt if I've ever understood Louisa. I don't think I educated her in quite the right way. Well, you're right there! I'll tell you what education is! Being thrown out of doors neck and crop and starved of everything except blows! Whatever the merits of such an education may be, it's difficult to apply it to girls. I don't see why. We won't quarrel on the matter. I wanted to ask you, my dear Bounderby, if you would allow Louisa to stay here a while with Sissy... I mean, Cecilia. ...who understands her. I gather from all this that you, uh, think there's some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself. I'm afraid there's incompatibility between Louisa and almost everybody at present. I'm a Coketown man! I... I know every brick, chimney-stack and millhand in this town. They're real! Anything else is turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon! And since that's what Loo wants, I suggest that you provide it for her because she'll not get it from me! There's no need to use that tone, Bounderby. You may change like a weathercock, Gradgrind, but I stay what I am, what I've always been. Your daughter, sir, doesn't appreciate me. I don't impress her. This is unreasonable. I think it's devilish reasonable. For years, I couldn't afford the price of a shoehorn let alone the price of a shoe. But there are ladies, born ladies, from families, families, who worship the ground I walk on. -Isn't that so? -Yes. [SNEEZES] Yes, sir. If your daughter isn't home by 12 noon tomorrow, I shall take it that she prefers to stay here. Please. Bounderby, you've accepted her for better or worse. No! Everyone will know that Josiah Bounderby and Loo Gradgrind were two horses who wouldn't pull together. And that's the truth of it, without any sentimental humbug! [SNEEZES LOUDLY] -[TRAIN DEPARTING] -[HOOFBEATS DEPARTING] And thanks to you, Mr Bounderby, Stephen Blackpool is now named in public print all over town. It's shameful. He's the honestest lad that ever walked. Where is he then, if he's so honest? I've told you. He went away to find work. BOUNDERBY: Ah. There you are, Mrs Bounderby. I'm sorry to call you out, but this woman here has been telling me a cock-and-bull story that you went to see her and Stephen Blackpool and gave him money. It's true. Why the devil didn't you tell me? I promised my sister I wouldn't. That's true. Why was he seen outside this bank that evening? RACHEL: I don't know. I think it was to meet someone about a job. BOUNDERBY: Who? RACHEL: I don't know. Have you any idea who it might be? That person may be the thief. I don't know, but I've written to Stephen and told him to come back to clear himself. Have you indeed? Well, ma'am, my spies in the post office tell me that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever been sent. The only time he ever wrote to me he said he's been forced to change his name so as to get work. Changed his name, has he? Oh, that's unlucky for such an immaculate man. Innocent men don't change their names. What's his name now? I'll never tell you. Then where is he? If he's so innocent, why hasn't he come back? I don't know. Goodnight, Father. Louisa, do you believe this man Blackpool's the thief? I did so once because I wanted to believe he was. Stop! I got her! The old woman. The one outside the bank. Let me in with her. No, no, no! No, no, no! No, please. No, no, no, no, no! Right! Hah! To Mr Bounderby's! Quick! She's mine! Now we'll know the truth. MRS SPARSIT: No escape! I've found one of them! -Where's Mr Bounderby? -MAN: Upstairs. Don't let her out of your sight! What is it? What is it, Mrs Sparsit? I've found the old woman we saw outside the bank. BOUNDERBY: Good work, Mrs Sparsit! I found her for you after some trouble. Where's she gone? But trouble in your service is a pleasure to me, sir. Show yourself, ma'am. What the devil do you think you're doing, Mrs Sparsit? [STUTTERING] Sir? How dare you poke your great officious nose into my affairs! My dear Josiah, it's not my fault. I told her you wouldn't like it, but she wouldn't listen. Why did you let her bring you in? Why didn't you knock her teeth out or break her legs? She threatened me with the police. So I had to come quiet. Hmm. Ooh. [GASPS WITH DELIGHT] Such a fine house you've got. It's not my fault, Josiah. I live quiet and secret like I promised. Never broke our agreement once. Never said I was your mother. Just admired you from a distance. And if I come to town now and again for a proud peep at you, I done it secret, my love, and gone away again. I'm surprised, madam. You have the gall to face your son after the unnatural way you treated him. Me? Unnatural? To my dear boy? Well, not so dear when you abandoned him as a baby and left him to the care of a drunken grandmother. His grand... His grandmother died before he was born! And never touched a drop of hard liquor! Oh, may God forgive you your wicked imagination! But, madam, you left your son to be brought up in the gutter. What gutter? Josiah was never in no gutter ever, though he comes from humble parents. His parents who loved him. Never thought of the hardship on themselves to save so that he could get an education. Well, even after his poor father died, I managed to buy him an apprenticeship, though I only had a village shop and the takings were small enough. Still, he paid me back like a loving son. He pensioned me off on Â£30 a year not to trouble him. I don't exactly know how I came to be favoured with the presence of the existing company. Were you all invited to hear a lecture on my family affairs? [SCOFFS] Officious busybodies! Out! Out! Good evening! They've found Stephen. [SCREAMING] [CONTINUES SCREAMING] Lift him slowly. Easy. -[WHIMPERING] -Easy. Careful. It's mangled the life out of him. How did it happen? He fell in, walkin' across the field. When the mineshaft was workin', it killed without need. Now it's abandoned, it still kills without need. So we die without need one way or another. [INAUDIBLE] Just don't let go my hand, Rachel. Are you still in pain, my dear one? Some. Some. It's all a muddle, eh? It's all a muddle. Oh, young lady, I was thinking of you before I fell. And your brother, what you had done to me. It's no matter now. Will you take a message to your father? My father's here. Oh, sir. Promise you'll clear my name. How? Your son, Tom, will tell you. I met with him one night. And I waited. But I make no charges. Promise me! I promise. Don't let go of my hand, Rachel. Don't let go of me. I'll hold it all the way. All the way. Why are you crying? If I hadn't woken up that night, your wife would have died and we'd have been free. If you hadn't made that promise for my sake, you wouldn't have gone away. And if I hadn't written to you, you wouldn't have come back. I did it for the best. Uh, yes. It's all a muddle, isn't it? It's a fair old muddle. [CHOKING] Cover my face. -Father... -Did you know about Tom? Yes. Do you think he planned the robbery? He needed the money. And he deliberately cast suspicion on that poor dead man. Now I'll have to tell everyone the truth. -I promised. -What about Tom? I'll have to arrange his escape. No, Sissy has already done that. Mr Sleary's circus is pitched over at Kettely. I sent Tom there with a note. Mr Sleary will make the arrangements. -[DRUMROLL] -[CYMBAL CRASHES] [CIRCUS AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Oh. Oh. Sissy! [LAUGHING] -Sissy! -Oh, you're back. [ALL CHEERING] Oh, my little poppet. Eh, Sissy. The horses missed you. You was always their favourite. I'm getting married next week, Sis. To a widow. Her husband was thrown in a heavy back fall off an elephant. Oh, I've missed you all so much! Mr Sleary, is my brother safe? Safe and well. He's here in disguise till we can move him. Thank you, Mr Sleary. I'm a bleary brandy-and-water veteran myself, squire. You stood by our Sissy, so we'll stand by you. Can I see Tom? Later. After the show's over. Hello? Father? [LAUGHING] How was it done? What done? The robbery! Oh, that! Well, I had a key made, and I waited my time. I'm in agony. Why? Why? Why? So many people work in situations of trust, and a certain percentage of those people will be dishonest. You told me a hundred times it's a law. How can I help laws? You've comforted everyone else with your laws, Father, so comfort yourself. I must get you to Liverpool and then abroad. Yes, I suppose so. I can't be more miserable anywhere else than I have been here. We'll get you changed, then we'll take you to the station. It's a banker's draft. You'll be provided for wherever you end up. May God forgive you. -Oh, Tom! -No! Not you! I have nothing to say to you. LOUISA: Is this how it ends after my love for you? Pretty words. You left old Bounderby and had my best friend Harthouse packed off just like that! Don't talk about him. If you ever loved me, please don't talk about him. You gave me up! You never cared for me! Sorry to interfere with your plans, but I must have Mr Tom. I always suspected you did the robbery. I suggest you come quiet, or do I have to blow this whistle and tell all the world? Bitzer, don't do this. Have you got a heart? Of course, sir. The circulation couldn't be carried on without one. No man acquainted with the facts relating to the circulation of the blood can doubt I have a heart. But can it be touched by compassion? It can be touched by reason. And nothing else. Why? What reason can you have for stopping my son escaping? Sir, since you've asked my reason, it's only reasonable to let you know. Mr Bounderby will promote me to Tom's place in the bank for this. It's a promotion I've always wanted. So it's solely a question of self-interest. No, sorry to interrupt you, sir, but, as a true Conservative, you must know the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to is a person's self-interest. It's our only hold. It's how we're made. You taught me that, sir, when I was very young. How much do you want? Oh, thank you, sir, for trying to bribe me. I knew, with your clear mind, you'd suggest this, so I went through the calculating in my head. And found that to compound a felony, no matter how well paid, would not be as safe, or as good, for me as staying with Mr Bounderby. So I must regretfully say no. Bitzer, can't I appeal to you? You were at my school. I paid for it. Surely, it's a fundamental principle of your party that everything has to be paid for. Everything from birth to death is a bargain across a counter and must be paid for in cash. But what about God? And your chance of heaven? This is the best way to heaven, sir. And if it isn't, it's not a place run on sound economic principle and we've no business there. Ah, hmm-hmm? What's this, squire? This man is a criminal. If anyone tries to stop me, I'll call the police and you'll all be in trouble. Oh, yeah. If he's a criminal, squire, then we must help you. Father! It will be in your interest if you help me get this man to the police. I'll hitch a trap for you, sir. Mr Bounderby will appreciate it. He's a generous man. KIDDERMINSTER: That's right. All aboard, sirs. Squire, you'd better take old Grumpus along with you for protection. You know what to do, Grumpus. -Go, madam, go. -I'm going, sir. Oh, I think you're too cramped under my humble roof, madam. Please don't bite my nose off. I cannot, madam. It's too big. I am only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Forgive me, I think I must have been wasting your time. In my judgement, this is no place for a lady with a genius like yours for poking into other people's affairs. In your judgement, indeed. Everybody knows how unerring Mr Bounderby's judgement is. Everybody talks about your judgement. I have only this to say. For a long time, I've always thought of you as a noodle. Nothing a noodle says or does comes as a surprise. A noodle is a noodle, and you're a noodle! BITZER: Why is this horse dancing? Stop that man! I need that. Someone, stop that man! [DOG BARKING] Kidderminster and Childers will stay with young Tom till he boards the ship in Liverpool, squire. Once he's safely away, I'll make amends. Yes, well, you take the carriage back, squire. I'll rescue young Mr Bitzer from old Grumpus. Squire? Does Sissy still ask after her father? Always, Mr Sleary. He's dead, squire. A year ago. -Will you tell her? -No, no. There's nothing comfortable to tell. Will you? No. It'll only make her unhappy. Yes. People have too much unhappiness. That's why they must be amused. We can't always be a-learning, we can't always be a-working. No, we aren't made for it. We must try and do the right thing, the kind thing. Make the best of ourselves, not the worst. [IMITATES SQUISHING] [GULPS] [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] "Hello, squire." [NORMAL VOICE] Hello. People must be amused. [LAUGHING] Ah, well, squire. All things change and change about. If I could see into the future. STEPHEN: Look how we live and where we live. And our only end is in death. Look on it, ma'am, and then tell me if it isn't all a fair muddle. Dearest Louisa. YOUNG TOM: I'm sick of my life, Loo. I hate everybody. YOUNG LOUISA: Not me, Tom? YOUNG TOM: No, not you, Loo. I don't know what I'd do without you. [SOBBING] Forgive me. Forgive me. YOUNG LOUISA: I can't make you laugh, Tom. YOUNG TOM: I can't make you. YOUNG LOUISA: It's a great pity for both of us. YOUNG TOM: You're a girl, Loo, and girls come out of it better than boys. YOUNG LOUISA: You're a dear brother, Tom. [GRUNTS] Wait a bit! BITZER: Everything has to be paid for. Everything from birth to death is a bargain across a counter and must be paid for in cash. GRADGRIND: People say there is a wisdom of the head and a wisdom of the heart. I didn't believe it. I thought the wisdom of the head was enough. No, I've no complaints. You're an affectionate young woman, and we must make that do. On the other hand, squire, it might not turn out like that at all.
