Valmiki! Is your wife admitted here? Yes... First floor, General ward. Where is Mr. Ramachandra’s wife? She’s on the second floor… Special ward. It’s a baby boy. That’s great news. I don’t have change… I can’t afford to tip you a note. Thank god. Sister, clean the baby and put her to bed. We must inform Mr. Ramachandra about this. It’s very big news for them, okay? Okay, doctor. Note down the exact time. I don’t want the horoscope to be messed up. It’s 12... Sir, I need the phone. Can’t you see that I’m talking here? It’s an emergency, sir. Mr. Ramachandra’s baby boy… So what? He was stable when the doctor saw him last. But he’s not moving now. Ma’am is under sedation. I’ll call you back. Doctor informed the family that it’s a baby boy. I’m really worried… They are influential people. I’m afraid they will pin this on me. Fine. I’m blessed with a boy… Let’s switch Mr. Ramachandra’s son with mine. I working in their company. It’s their generosity that I lead a decent life. This is the least I can do for them. I’ll give them my baby boy. How will you explain this to your wife? Only my family will prosper if he is with us. But a whole community will prosper If he is with them. I will sacrifice my child. By God’s grace, hopefully I’ll have another kid in a year or so. Sir, listen to me. Don’t say a word… Just come with me. Come on. Pick him up. Pick him up. We are switching dead baby with a baby. What’s wrong? Pick him up. Make it fast. Let’s get out, Come on. Let’s go! Sir… He's alive. Give him to me. Sir! - Give him to me! - Sir, no! - Sir! Sir! - Shut up! No, sir. You did sacrifice your kid… But now you are betraying them. Betrayal? Ramachandra and I joined this company at the same time. We’d go to the office together on my scooter. He got lucky and married ARK’s daughter and drives car now. What about me? And I’m still driving the same old scooter. He just got lucky. This baby though... He could’ve cried when we switched him with my son. He started crying when we got downstairs. Why? He is unlucky. My son is destined to lead a superior life. While his son leads an ordinary life. It’s God’s play... There’s nothing I can do about it. - Go away! - No, sir. Don’t do it. This is not betrayal... It’s a sin. You were plotting it this whole time. - I can’t let you do this. - Shut up! - Don't separate baby from his mother. - I said shut up! I won’t let you do this. Give the baby to me. I said let go! Don’t make a scene now. It’s over! Forget it and go away. - Give the baby back to me. - I said go away! Hey, Valmiki! It's a baby boy. How about you? Baby boy or baby girl? - Baby boy! - Congrats! Congrats! What’s wrong? Nothing. I got a leg cramp. Actually, you got lucky, man. Baby. ‘Ala Vaikuntapuramlo’ What’s his name? Raj! Raj Manohar! Raj! Raj Steels! Raj Infra! Amazing! Did you like it? It’s a royal name, sir. The name a King deserves. This is all good. But have you thought of any names for your son? Yes. Tell me. Is that a name? Is this ‘The’ name? Yeah! What kind of name is this? I’ve performed several naming-ceremonies till date. But I have never and will never approve of such a name. I’ll be putting my image at stakes with this name. - Priest... - What? What? What? How can you call your son ‘Bantu’ (Servant)? It’s disgusting! Right! Why? Lord Hanuman is called ‘Rama Bantu’. He’s still worshipped. Lord Hanuman and Lord Rama are an exception. Whose servant is your son going to be? I’m asking you. What is this? - You scored 9 in Math? - Hmm. It’s okay if your teacher didn’t give you a higher score. We’ll add it. 7... - What are you doing, Valmiki? - Ma’am... Raj’s progress report. Oh. His score in Math? Umm... 97. Raj! Well done! Dear! He scored 98 in Math. Why did you leave those 2 marks? You should’ve scored a 100. How can you say that, dear? He got such a good score. His score won’t change anything. Few people are born that way. Very bad! After 20 years Hey, stop it! Hold it properly. Thank god! he’s here and my son is in the palace. He’s happy even while sleeping. Even though you lost everything, How do you manage to stay happy? Hey! Grandma has sent pickles. you need to go get it. Go to the bus stand. Do I have an option? Here you go, dear Coconut and camphor. Where’s the pumpkin? - We don’t have it. Did you add it to the lentils broth? - I did, sir. He is coming home from America after 2 years. We need pumpkin to ward off evil. Damn it! He isn’t coming home after a great achievement. He dropped out in the final semester of MBA. Please calm down, sir. Third semester! - Only three? - Hmm. - Hello. - Hey. Are you at the bus stand? Yes, you told me to collect pickles. Dump them, buy a pumpkin and come to Mr. ARK’s residence. Pumpkin?! Yes! Pumpkin! How will I get pumpkin here? - Pumpkin? - Don’t be late. It’s urgent. Autorickshaw! Wait here. Hey! Hey! Where are you rushing? - Relax! You can’t carry it. I’m carrying your burden. This is nothing. Give it to me. I’ve been noticing since I was a kid. You never let me cross the gate, What’s your problem? It’s Vaikunthapuram (Divine Abode), son. No entry for losers like you. Few lives don’t get any better. Very bad! Go back home. Raj is here! Raj is here! He has affection towards everyone except me. Sir, should I drop the luggage inside? Why would I hire an auto, If I had such a big house. Let's go... Let’s drive through the bumpy lanes of Ameerpet. That’s our range. Have you been drinking a lot in America? You are shining. Well, he’s back… You both can drink together now. What did you get me? He’s already feeling low, dad. Don’t hurt him more. Please! But we are hurt not him. Dad, I have to do some shopping… Take me with you while going to office… I’m busy… He will take you. What is she saying? She says he’s got an interview. It’s 8’o clock now. His interview is at 10. Ask him to take her, buy medicines for his mom... And then attend the interview. Plenty of time on his hands. Ugh! Not again. What is she saying now? How can he manage in such short span of time? Like I manage this family with my salary. Ask him to do the same. - Hey! - Huh? We are from a middle class family. We have tons of things to worry about. We have to move on. - Okay. Brother! Brother. Buy medicines for mom. I’m running late for my interview. - They snatched my scarf? - I know, right? If girls like the color, they will snatch it What will men do with a scarf? They must be out of their minds. Buy chocolates with the change. Usually, brothers get very angry and fight When men misbehave with their sisters. Hey... Relax! You have way too many expectations from me, sweetheart. I’m late for my interview. Would you react like this if it were your girlfriend? No. Get lost! Damn!! That was provoking. I feel like doing something now. Brother, did you see a gang pass by with a scarf in their hands? The guys on the red bike? How does that matter? Where did they go? Brother... That scarf... Belongs to my sister. Your sister looks smoking hot, man. Thank you. Can I get the scarf back? Get your sister here in exchange for the scarf. Scarf... Give me the scarf! When he said my sister looks hot, I didn’t feel bad. She’s a beautiful girl. I was happy that she’d save some money on the dowry. That’s how we middle class people think. But that guy intervened like some 80s villain... And said sister in exchange for the scarf. How could he say that? No, listen... He ripped my heart apart. Looking up and to the sides when I’m sad is my mannerism. But you don’t have the basic sense of thinking twice before hitting someone. Chinni. - Sorry brother… I got angry. That’s fine. I got you scarf back. - They gave it back? - Yes, they cleaned it too. That move? Stylish, right? - I like it too. - How? I don’t know… It just worked out. Why do you want to join our tourism company? With the help of your company I can visit countries. He's energetic. Give me your file. - I’m Ravinder Reddy. - Hello, sir. - I deal with sales in this company. - Okay. But the HR met with a small accident. He’ll be joining us later. So let’s proceed. - Sure. All the best. Hey! I like your sense of humor, man. - Thank you, sir. Bantu. Interesting name! Okay, lets go down. Dream. People usually about visit Bangkok or buy Bentley car. But yours reads, ‘I want to buy a bike’. ‘First Hand’ in brackets. - Have you got time to spare, sir? - Lots of it. - Dear... - Hmm? His college is starting tomorrow. Did you bring him any new clothes? Of course, I did. I said Mr. Ramachandra’s son that Bantu was starting college. He gave me all his old clothes right away. That’s not it... I was looking at the perfume in his hand. Was he gracious enough to give his used perfume as well? Kidding me, huh? Do you want it or not? Do you have something to say? I was forced to. You’re always so blunt and honest, huh? I get headache whenever I lie. And when I started speaking the truth… The other person started having a headache. I feel so relaxed now, sir. So you must’ve started telling the truth about the little things first. Not at all, sir. I had gone straight for the big fish. Hey! I guess it’s the loan shark. Tell him I’m not home. Hey... Is your father home? Father... He asked me to tell you he isn’t home. So shameless! How could you make your kid lie for you? You’ve already lost one of your legs. Betray a good man like and me you’ll lose the other one as well. Whatever. That leg is going to hurt badly. What did you just tell him? Better, you should’ve led him to me directly. You’re just supposed to say ‘Dad’s not home’. That’s it! Hey, can I see your dad? He’s not home... Why do we care if he’s behind the wall or under the table? He’s not home and that’s final. Your wife is not home, right? Shameless fellow. Hey! We are middle class family. How will you deal with life if you can’t say few lies? Hey, you’re always busy cooking. Get some sense into him. Besides, you’re not Ramachandra’s son. You can’t afford to speak the truth always. Moreover, aren’t you afraid? If I tell the truth, I’ll be afraid only for that moment. But if I lie, I’ll be afraid all the time. Wow! That was a great punch! You rocked! A mother is in pain only when she’s giving birth. But a father’s in pain throughout the kid’s life. Hey! Why are you not clapping? He has fans and they clapped for him. You have none and so you get nothing. Sit down and eat. - You got a seat in MBA. - It was a prestigious college, sir. Why did you give it up? Hey! The job is done. I sorted everything out. Sort? How could you cancel his scholarship to get her a seat? He’s a man. He’ll figure something out. What are you looking at, huh? Son... Shall I tell you something? You might have scored 90+ runs a zillion times. But your number of centuries still stands at zero. That explains your life to the dot. You almost get what you want but never quite have it. Like I told you, few lives don’t get any better. Very bad! This tragedy calls for more than a century, Bantu. - Too heavy, sir? - Yeah! Shall we try something musical? Something light-hearted. Definitely. Hey! Give the table lamp and desk to your sister, She has to study. My son is always a King. “I can’t begin to tell you my story. My pain has no ending” “Why are these dads torturing us?” “They don’t listen to us or understand us” “Thinking of dad gives me chills all over” “I ask for 100 bucks and he reminds me we’re not rich” “I cry to myself thinking he’s out of his mind" “It’s the same scene in every household. What do you say, bro?” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Don’t be so hard on me” “That will make me sad” “My name is Bantu and I hate my name” “I fight with my cunning dad day and night” “My mother’s husband...” “Turned out to be my dad” “You can’t lock rain in a bottle” “You can’t capture joy in a snap” “There are no shortcuts to freedom” “You can deny me or join hands with me” “You can’t fit the woods in your backyard” “You can’t make a pigeon your paperweight” “You can’t start bonfire using volcano” “I’m a blank cheque that’s not cashed” “He ain't always right” “Spy daddy!” “He ain't always right” “Spy daddy!” “Spy daddy!” “Spy daddy!” “Spy daddy!” “Spy daddy!” “Being the son of Valmiki means being the epitome of problems” “Only Thanos can make people in this house smile with a snap” “My mother’s husband...” “He’s one big dummy” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Don’t be so hard on me” “That will make me so sad” He wants a new bike. He can use my scooter. That’s enough, son. He gets emotional for small things… Enough… let me go. No, you are safe here. I might hit you if you are far from me. Bantu, after listening to your story, I feel like killing your dad. But it’s a huge risk. It also makes me want to adopt you and send you abroad. But it’s a costly affair. Because I can’t do either of it… Let me offer you this job. - Thank you, sir. - Come on, dear. Sign here. This should end all your miseries. Sir... Sekhar is here. Great timing! He’s our HR. Meet him and make a good first impression. I’ll impress him, sir. Sir... Hey! What happened? I was happy you got the job. but I’m shocked you hit the HR. What to do, sir? This is the time to put your character, integrity and individuality aside... and say sorry. Mr. Reddy... Sir... Hey! What are you doing here? Get out! - Hey! Get out! - I’m begging you. Please sir... I’m begging you. I really need this job sir… Please sir, please sir... I’ll give you the job... I feel like I’m going to puke. Stop it right now. You will stand by your word, right? Yes, let go of me! Thank you sir… Sign here… Right here... Right here, sir... That's it! Hey, he signed it! But how? I touched his feet like you said. - What did he do? - He signed my papers. I will catch him red handed. You go downstairs. I’ll come join you. - See you, sir. Did he hit you hard? He hit me with a scarf but it was... I won’t say the word. But he broke my heart, Reddy. No matter what you say, I believe he has no ego. That is why he touched your feet. - What about me? You have no common sense. That is why you snatched his sister’s scarf. I didn’t snatch it, Reddy. It got stuck on my hand. Good morning, sir! I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. You could’ve returned the scarf. - I didn’t want to create a scene. - Well, you already did. - Why is the production on hold? - No stock, sir. Then order it. Distribution has been halted because we didn’t pay the bills, sir. Call the bank and clear the due. The OD is already too high. - Oh. I’ll speak to them. - Okay, sir. Up!? Morning. - I said morning. - Good morning. - Which floor? - Where are you going? - Floor 9. - Me too. Pack your bags. Yeah. Yeah. I’ve never seen you around. I joined yesterday. - Yesterday? - Hmm. Yesterday. Have you met your boss? He didn’t come to office yesterday. All the best. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. This looks good too. I saw a girl in the elevator earlier. She blew my mind. Is she the receptionist, Mr. Reddy? I’d be with her right now if she was so beautiful. Go and greet our boss first. We can relax for the day. Relax and chill! I’ll impress her and be right back. Definitely. Good morning, sir Now what did you do? Hey! I thought you were just in the elevator with ma’am. But you were trying to get on her. - Sir! - I won’t say the word. You were trying to flirt with her, huh? What do we do, Mr. Reddy? Bantu... Bantu... Bantu... You had a problem yesterday as well. I gave you a solution and it worked out. You want me to touch her feet? Any other alternatives? Best option, sir. So get going, my man! - Okay, sir. - Hey, Reddy. He doesn’t just hold legs… He twists them according to his convenience. Bantu. Cute! Come in. You think the name Bantu is cute? It’s disgusting, ma’am. In the elevator earlier... Hello... Look up. My eyes are up here. It’s hard for me, ma’am. You’re working under me. And I’m really happy about it, ma’am. I’m your boss! - Only the cabin has changed. - I still have to touch people’s feet. Uh-huh? Telling the truth is my first nature, ma’am. Sadism is my mannerism, Bantu. What? People come here for holiday? Maybe they can eat without cooking. - I love you, baby. - I love you too, baby. I love you to death. I love you more. Hello... Hey. Why don't you change the topic? I'm bored. What? Why are you guys just leaving? That’s the only thing on your mind, huh? - Hello. - Ma’am... - Who’s this? - It’s me, ma’am. Who are you? You got upset with me for staring at your legs in the lift... And so you sent me to Kutch. It’s me. Bantu I haven’t seen a fellow human being in 3 days. And this couple is lost in love. Oh my god! This guy is pulling out the camping tents. The temperature here is blazing, ma’am. Please do something. Something, huh? Okay, I’ll do it. Wow! What a beautiful place. Nice pictures. This is nice. I’ll stab you! Stop crushing her. See that? Let's go there. Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am! Stop! It’s very steep… You will fall down. I’ll setup a rope and you can grab it and go down. Okay. Don’t grab him. Grab the rope. Okay, let’s go. Wow! He is dancing so nice. Yes. It’s recorded. - Wow! He is a good dancer. - Yeah… Really nice. - His dance moves are so nice. Wow! - Very nice. Hey! Don’t stop! Don’t stop! Keep dancing that is such a nice move. Ma’am... Who is it? It’s me, ma’am. These people think I am dancing but I am actually shivering… They uploading the videos on internet ma’am. Just give me a corner seat in our office. I’ll be at your feet. I don't understand your fantasy with legs. I didn’t mean it like that, ma’am. I’m begging you. Please! Sulochana... Sulochana... Are you sleeping? Good... Sleep. I bought you 24 apples per year, 2 per month. So that makes 600 apples in the last 25 years. Pointless. You are not conscious... You don’t eat. I have diabetes... I can’t eat. On top of that, this leg keeps bothering me. When we fought for the baby in the hospital that day... I had a leg cramp, remember? It just got worse with time and now I’m limping. You actually got lucky... You are in coma for so long. Because it happened on the day my son was born... Mr. Ramachandra is continuing your treatment against all odds. So don’t feel guilty about it. How long will you...? - You speak Telugu? - What? Malayalam, huh? How long will you cling on to this body? Just let go. Take my advice and die in peace. Doctor. Doctor... Did you check her Blood pressure? Where is the nurse? I want her reports. Fast! Put oxygen mask on. Is she going to live? Probably for 2 years if she’s in coma. She has 2 more months. - Can she see? - It’s complicated. - Can she hear us? - I’m not sure. - Can she talk? - Impossible! Thank you. You act cranky under the sun. And you shiver in the snow. You call me off the hook and say ‘Ma’am...’ You’re good for nothing. Few lives don’t get any better, do they? What? Don’t belittle my life, ma’am. I’ve heard enough from my dad. I would get really angry when he says it. But now that you’re also saying it... I’m afraid it might be true. Over all these years, I’ve never had a single phenomenal day in my life. Is bad luck riding my dad, me or my life? I don't know. Ma'am, this is a request. Please wear pants and longer skirts. I can’t look away. So beautiful, ma’am. Get up. When there’s weight on your head, you can’t look down. - Ma’am? - You can observe it, Bantu. True. More the weight, further you look up. More the hard work, further your succeed Go. Work on the Paris tour. Thank you, ma’am. Book the return flight for the 5th. - Okay. Okay. Ma’am is... Ma’am! Look. Ma’am, sir... She’s ma’am! We know she’s our ma’am. What next? Actually, ma’am... Bantu! Sekhar sir, we have to handle few things with love. Then do it. - Dear... - Yes, dear. For the first time... I saw madam’s eyes instead of her legs. Ma’am is... - Bantu! - Ma'am. Ma’am, huh? Ma’am, my foot! Sekhar sir, handle with love. He’s already in love with her. “My eyes are hooked on to your legs” “Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy” “My eyes are hooked on to your legs” “Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy” “My dreams will guard your eyes like kohl” “You set me on fire when you rub your rosy cheeks” “Your tresses fly as my breath whistles in the air” “Don’t get all cranky and push me away” “Sweetheart! I can’t help but fall for you” “You know how the heart sways to the youth’s beat” “Sweetheart! I can’t help but fall for you” “You know how the heart sways to the youth’s beat” “My eyes are hooked on to your legs” “Don’t step on my gaze, show some mercy” “You’re like the cool breeze spilling fragrances of jasmine” “You’re like the land shimmering with moonlight” “You’re like a peacock dancing in a garden of flowers” “I can’t begin to describe your elegance in words” “I caress you like the shadow that chases you” “Yet, you don’t react the slightest, girl” “I realize you’re not the girl who falls for trickery” “Pay heed to this sweet plea that makes my heart pound” “Sweetheart!

You are not meeting him. You will meet his son. Paidithalli ARK Infra. They are planning to expand their company. Ramachandran... The CEO of this company is getting old. His son Raj manohar... Is very slow. They need money and I want a part of his company. His son wants our company... So, his father is sending him to deal... To stop him, your father is sending you. - Sir. - No. See... It's easy to say 'No' to a waiter... But its difficult to reject an influenced person. So, when you reject a influential person, You will earn respect. Son, it's okay even if you don't get power. Be honest. That's enough. This is the truth. Bye. Hello... I am almost there ma'am... Don't worry, your father is in the hotel right behind us Hotel behind us? Thank you. Your load is exported to Korea from our port every month. That port is not your father's establishment. Tell him it belongs to the Government. But if we shut the gates, your company will be in dire loss. There are many ports in this country. Tell him, Raj. We will invest in your company. Welcome us with open arms. We will be a part of your company. Impossible! Tell him, Raj. Sudarshanam. My financier. The one in the Grey coat? - Bantu!! Respect! - Ma’am. We can cut down on diesel cost if 4 people take the same car. Similarly, you can cut down on holiday expenses if 4 families travel together. It was her concept. It's a great idea. I believed the same and invested 5 crores. You’ve got a big heart. She had a turnover of 50 crores in just 2 years. She’s got a big brain. I’m offering 100 crores… I want the company. That’s a huge amount. Sir! What's your answer? Say no! Why don't you talk? Say yes! Say yes, dear. Say no. Just say no! Paidithalli... This isn’t a temple where everyone is welcome. Besides, its loan when we ask for money. When we don’t accept the offer. It's rejection. It’s a no! Get out of my office! Ma’am will not sell her company... You speak. Sir, we floated the company ...affordable travel packages for the middle class. If you buy the company with such a huge amount, you’ll increase the rates. It will increasing their travel fare. So... So what ma’am is trying to say is... So... This generation has lost the courage to say 'No'. Hey, Das! They can tussle with us and still do business in the market? She’s a girl after all. We’ll crush you. That’s a big warning. Mr. Sudarshan.... I’m not so good at this pep talk. It will not match with my personality either. But the situation is demanding it. Only two people have the power to create something. This planet and women. Why do you want to mess with them? We just have to surrender. - Amulya, what’s happening? - Hush! If you’re still not convinced, I have three options. First... Beat your men and control you. Second, hit you and control you. Third, predicting that I will beat you and control yourself. If you think controlling you is common in all three options... You’re mistaken. What’s common is I will be smacking your men down. For better or worse... When someone says no to your offer, it means... ‘No!’ Most importantly, when a woman says 'No', it means... It's a 'No.' Ma’am, we can’t be here after that speech I just gave. Let’s get out of here when our energy levels are high. Come on... When I saw that guy in the morning... It felt like I was looking at my own reflection. But when I see my own son on the computer screen... He was struggling to say no... His weakness felt like my own. Is this my failure? Ramu, you were a clerk. You had to impress my dad to marry me. You had to work hard for it. But my son has nothing to prove. He was born a Prince. Don’t compare him with others. - I didn’t mean it, Yasu I just meant that guy spoke well. Ramu... Suppose we’re on our honeymoon. How would you feel if I say some guy hot in front of you? Can you handle that? That’s how I feel when you praise someone else’s son in front of me. Don’t ever do that. A mother's love is blind. That guy caught your attention. But for me, it was the girl. She made a lot of progress with the company in just 3 years. If she’s with us, she can do wonders. How about we get your son married to her? She will bring the perfect balance. - Daddy... - Yes, dear? Why do I have to wear a saree for dinner? Because it’s a dinner invite from Mr. ARK. I wouldn’t have cared if it were someone else. Don’t be so dumb. The saree and the bouquet are to impress them. Otherwise a box of sweets would do it. Let's go. In case they ask if you can cook... Casually lie that you’re almost good at it. Why would they ask me if I could cook? Is this an alliance? Just a casual meeting, dear. Besides, even if they were proposing marriage... It’s no big deal for them. Dad! Dear... What’s this? Give it to her if you like her. Grandpa said it would be a casual meeting. You should tell him you won’t meet anyone else because there your angel is at home. Hello. Why are you laughing? Am I not your angel? Get lost! The box... - Get lost! - Okay. Okay. Hi. Welcome. Welcome. I’m Ramachandra. I’m Anjaneya Prasad. Even my name suggests I’m at your service. - Hey! No! No! - Dad! Dear, isn’t it true? This old man has a knack for inviting embarrassing guests. Hi. Hi. Hi. Please come. Welcome. Welcome. What would you like to have? We’re blessed to be sitting next to you. What more could we ask for? We’ll eat whatever you serve. As long as it’s edible. - You have good sense of humor. - Thank you. Thank you. You guys aren’t talking much. Because you are. My daughter is soft spoken. Yeah, right. She doesn’t even bargain when she goes shopping. Your son is soft spoken as well. He expressed it with a box. Oh my god! Dear, you’re so lucky! Fortune is calling. My miserable days are over. Feels like the Lords of Wealth are paying me a visit. What are you looking at? Get up! Give it a second thought. I think it’s too fast. This whole time, you were worried about him being slow. Now you’re worried that he’s going fast. Dad! What are you waiting for? Let’s get them engaged. Why are you crying? Tears of joy. What are you doing here? Ma’am called me... I thought she had some work... You don't have any work here. Go! Correct. Hey. I bought that ring so that he will marry my daughter. He’s doing it. You turned this lunch into an engagement. My daughter had a lot of expectations on her wedding. Then let’s make sure we don’t fall short. My daughter will commit suicide if she can’t marry him. She aspired to become Collector when she was a kid. Did that happen? She will not do everything she says. Don’t worry. Come on. - Ma'am. - This is all your fault. What did I do? Because you hit Sudarshanam’s men and Mr. Ramachandra noticed you. Because he noticed you, he spoke to my father. Because he spoke to my father, I had to get engaged. Did Sudarshanam get scared and back off? He called us to the police station for a meeting. - Don't worry, ma'am. - Hey... Hey... - Sit. - Ma'am. No, you are angry. Is she your wife? No way. She's my boss. But her body language says something else. She’s scolding you with so much confidence. You can judge by body language? My foot! She already got engaged yesterday. I don't think so. It'll work out soon. What's gonna happen? You are not Ramachandra's son. She's very practical. Reddy influenced him… Hey, stop it... Stop it. It will work out, trust me. - What are you saying? - Really? Morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - What's the issue? - Sir, I gave her five crores. We asked for our money and he got physical. He didn't just ask for money. He wants the whole company. On top of that, he was being insensitive to girls. That is when I hit him, sir. - Did he cuss women? - Yes, sir. Then you have to file a case on him. Hey... Call the writer. He’s not some fighter that you’d call the writer. Look at him... Look at my bodyguard, above six feet. How can we believe this guy hit him? - You have a point. That’s a lie, sir. I hit him. I’ll hit him again if I have to. - Can you notice any difference? - What difference? He was standing till now, but now he is sitting there. Maybe he is tired standing, so he sat down I hit him and he fell there. - Give me a break. - Sir. I hit him when you bent down. He was in the air when you stood up. He was sitting by the time you saw him. Dear... Why don't you take him to a good doctor? Yes, sir... I'll do that. What’s wrong? What happened? It's a stylish fight scene sir... Things like these don’t happen often. All of you together made it a big lie. I'm hurt. You are hurt? - What's your problem? - I just hit him again, sir. But I didn't see it. - Call him back. I can hit him again. - That's wrong. You can’t say things like that to the police. You don’t believe me when I say I hit him. You don’t look when I actually hit him. You don’t agree when offer to hit him again. You’re impossible, sir. - Bantu! Dear... Why do you want to get locked up? - You have a bright future. - I know, sir. Don't interrupt me while I talk! I'll kill you! - Dear, what does he do for you? - Annoy me. So nobody believes I hit him. Hey! This is your final chance. I’ll ask her. Whatever she says is final. - You should stand by that. - Yes. - Did he beat that guy? - No, sir! Not at all! - He’s so sweet! - Discussion over! Ma’am, you are also lying. Why are you so keen on getting arrested? But I had to tell the truth. I don’t want the engagement. Did I say it out? - We can’t tell the truth all the time. - Exactly. Nothing will go wrong if you tell the truth, ma’am. You should do the same with your dad. I told him. He said he’ll commit suicide. Then tell Raj’s father. Mr. Ramachandra? No ways! Ma’am… Ma’am… Listen to me please… Try telling Mr. Ramachandra once. - Trust me and tell the truth. - Okay, I will. Give me that. Telling the truth solves all problems, ma’am. It really feels light. Because I took the bag from you? No, you idiot! I meant I feel lighter. I feel lighter! Bantu!! It’s obvious to be scared when you hit someone suddenly. He’s an idiot, man. Why do you care if he’s scared? - I don’t mean him. I’m scared! Me! - You’re scared. I get it. I have full clarity now. Sorry, Bantu. Are you hurt? Yes, but it feels good, ma’am. Ma’am... You are beating me. Don’t call me ma’am. It'll take time ma'am Call me Amulya. I know your name, ma'am. Actually, I like Ammu. It'll take time, ma'am It'll take lot of time. Did she fall for you? I already told you. Get out! “Who can be a better match to me? Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?” “Love is like chewing gum” “It sticks with you and doesn’t let go” “People have said this before” “But let me say it again” “I can’t hold it in” “You can’t restrain from love” “You are everything I’ve been looking for” “You became a part of me before I knew it” "Hey, pretty doll" “You’ve surrounded my thoughts” “You’ve held my hand in togetherness” "Hey, pretty doll" “You’ve surrounded my thoughts” “You’ve held my hand in togetherness” "I might have been quiet like multiplex audience" "But there are drums playing in my heart" "I might have just had a brain freeze" “This isn’t the Kings’ times, no chariot or horses” “I fight a battle against myself in front of the mirror” “You put forward your hands filled with bangles and come close” “You caress my cheeks and make me feel like a King” “I asked for pitter patter raindrops” “You’ve given me a cyclone” “I asked for a little jasmine” “You showered me with flowers” "Hey, pretty doll" “You’ve surrounded my thoughts” “You’ve held my hand in togetherness” “You’ve made me an eternal part of you” “You’ve given me a special place in your heart” “Who can be a better match to me? Why didn’t I realize this before, Ammu?” “Love is like chewing gum” “It sticks with you and doesn’t let go” “People have said this before” “But let me say it again” “I can’t hold it in” “You can’t restrain from love” Sir... Sir... He’ll be seeing you now. I’m Appala Naidu. I control everything in the port. I got my son into college so that he has a different lifestyle. I sent him to you with money because your company needed it. My son made it clear that we don’t need your money. Your son might listen to whatever you say. But I'll give my son whatever her asks for. If you try to stop it. People from Kolkata love to eat fish brains. People from Andhra love its tail. But the fish loves to live. To do so, it must stay farther away from the net. Once it falls into the net, there’s no going back. Let’s tell him later… Not now. We've have come very far... Let's tell the truth. Where is he? Maybe he is in the restroom. - Sit down. - It’s okay. Sir. Sir. Sir. - Shall I call the ambulance? - No… Call the car driver. Hey! Hey! Where’s the staircase? Bantu! What happened? - Any chances of making it? - Only God can save him now. God doesn’t exist anymore. Move... Let him breathe. - Shall I call his family? - Not now... Later. Sir. Sir. Bantu! Hey! - That’s our car. - We only stabbed him. Let it go. - You said he had no chance. - You said God didn’t exist. Sir. Sir. I'll inform his family. Calm down, ma’am. One moment. Ra... Ra... Ramachandra? Do you know him? - What… - What happened? Someone... Umm... He met with a small accident. Don’t worry. He’s fine. Is he your father? My father? Sadly, no. No. He's my father. He's there. [GASPING] Tell me. That’s not your father. Your father is... Ra... Ra... Rama... It doesn’t change the fact that he’s my father. You need to relax. Please sit, sir. I’ll check if ma'am is here. He’s... He’s not your father. Ah! He’s not your father. I don’t think you’re feeling well. Let me call the doctor. Wait a minute... Stop talking. He’s... not your father. He’s Valmiki. You know my father? Valmiki... Valmiki is not your father. Valmiki is not your father. Ramachandra... Ramachandra... is your father. What do you mean? I don’t get it. Yes... Ramachandra is your father. I only switched you. You didn’t move when you were born. Before I could tell the doctor about it... Your... Your name? Bantu. You were born as Raj (King). You are the real Raj (King). I picked you up from the rich side... And put you into a poor family. That guilt is killing me. Only the God and I know that. I have to tell this to your father before I die. I should only tell him. Call him... Raj... Call your father. Call him! Get Ramachandra here. Call him. Raj... Raj... Call your father. Get Ramachandra. Call him. He's inside. What is the patient doing here? - Sister, what are you doing? - Sir... You’re supposed to be alert. What is this patient doing here? - Is Dr. Bhaskar Reddy available? - Yes, sir. - Let’s shift her to critical care. - Okay, sir. Hello... Sir... My daughter… - On the way, sir. I spoke with the doctors. His heart is totally fine. Just some blood loss. He should recover soon. No issues so far... I have it all sorted. I don’t think so, Kasi. What about security? Hello, ma’am. - Where’s father? - He’s sitting in the back. - Call him. - Okay, ma’am. Bantu? Who is he? Bantu. He works in my office. So it’s you brother-in-law was bragging about. Actually, he saved uncle. He was also at the hotel last time. I didn’t notice. Ask him to wait downstairs. I’ll talk to him later. Thanks. It’s okay. Don’t feel bad, Bantu. Father, DCP wants to talk to you. Thank you. Come dear. Just one second. Let’s go. This is how the rich people are... They never fail to remind us our place. We can never be one of them. I’ve been working for them since 25 years. But they never let me in. We should get used to this. That’s the way it is. We’re strangers We must behave like strangers. You know what they say. A King’s Palace hosts the prosperous alone. Just because he’s gotten close with us... We shouldn’t think like that. She’s no more. Poor lady. Take her away. You know her? Must be an orphan. You know I am very sensitive. I can’t take it. She must’ve done something really bad. She had a remorseful death. God’s watching over all of us. You have something to say? Hey! How dare you! I’m annoyed listening to your lies from childhood. But you never stop it. Actually, why don’t you take a break? Relax! Relax. Hey! Sit properly... You are leaning on me. As soon as you do something good... You can’t resist doing something worse. You can directly ask why I hit you. Why are you beating around the bush? Get off You just hit your dad and you’re passing statements about it? Bah! We’re in the middle of the road. You have something to say? You’re not real father. That is why I hit you. I’m not your father? I’m not your father? How do you think you were born then? Did you pop out of thin air? No, I didn’t. You got me down. That nurse was in coma for 25 years. How can you believe whatever she mumbles? I don’t remember mentioning anything about a nurse. Tell me. Is Ramachandra my father? Yes or no? Valmiki! You couldn’t shut up ever since I was born. Now speak up! Tell me! I... I just wanted my son to be happy. I get that part. But why did you torture me? You are jealous of my father. He started along with you and became a millionaire in no time. You couldn’t take it. But there’s nothing you can do to him. So you picture Ramachandra in me. Exactly why you’ve been troubling me since 25 years. You drove me crazy. What have I done to you, huh? Drink it... You look like you’re going to die. Will you reveal everything and expose me in front of everyone? Will you ruin my son’s life? I'm begging you. Please don’t tell anyone. If I reveal the truth... They will abandon your son right away. His mother will become his madam. His father will become his boss. A clerk like you will be his real father. He will commit suicide out of depression and die. I considered all this and chose to be silent back there. Besides, it’s my mother who’s going to weep if I expose you. I can’t call her auntie after she nurtured me for all these years. I can’t call her my mom just for the sake of wealth. I don’t want your wealth or their stature. You only keep it. I don’t need it. When you don’t want any of it... What do you get from knowing the truth? Freedom! The freedom of knowing that I don’t have to impress you. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been looking for ways to impress you. Now I realized you’re not going to like me after all. I’ve found my answer. I’m free. Free! Valmiki... Valmiki... I always get irritated when I see you. But for the first time, I feel sorry for you. Because... You can’t claim him as your son. I won’t accept you as my father. Few lives don’t get any better. Very bad! My vehicle has insurance. I have assurance he won’t tell anyone. Oh God! Mother... Aren’t you feeling well? Sister told me you didn't eat anything. I’ve been having temperature since evening. Your boiling. Wait. I’ll get you some medicine. Wait. No. You can’t stay like this... Get medicines, go. No need. I just want my kids to comfort me. I will get better. - Valmiki… - Sir? I want to meet your son. I'll give him a hug and thank him. - Get him once. - Excuse me. I’m the doctor that treated your son-in-law. She’s the nurse that assisted me. You need to hug the both of us and thank us. That will make some sense. How could you think someone else is more important? - Who is he!? - Hey! Hey! I’m the doctor. This room is for stitching. Not for stretching, okay? - What the hell are you talking? - What are you talking, oldie? Come with me for a moment. We shouldn’t upset doctors and drivers. The syringes and steering wheels are in their control. - Let’s get out of here. - Please leave! What’s the matter, dad? Shh! You were supposed to be here yesterday. But no one told me about it. A son is supposed to check on his father and mother... Also on what’s going on around the house. Nobody will tell you. I can’t believe you brought a bouquet like some stranger. - How much is the bill? - 1.2 lakhs, sir. Make it round figure. 10 lakhs. Round figure for 1.2 lakhs would be 1 lakh. Not 10 lakhs. Oh. You’re not Subrahmanyam. - No. - What’s up, sir? He knows nothing about round figures. Explain it to him. - If we charge the medicines at 10 lakhs... - This bill is going to top Jayalalitha’s. Luckily she didn’t have a brother like him… Otherwise, her bill would have crossed the state budget. Her husband is in a critical condition. And yet, she hasn’t shed a single tear. Unlike we middle class people, she didn’t sob for him. Pin drop silence. Really? Yeah! What? They’re of a different class. Different class? Are you crazy? Husband and wife don’t have a proper conversation. His son gets him a bouquet like he’s an stranger. Don’t even get me started on his brother-in-law. He’s looting all their money in the name of hospital bills. Why do we care about them? I don’t get it. How come father and son are having a conversation without turning it into a fight? It’s nothing. I was telling him that house is like a temple. And the couple is like Lord Shiva and Parvathi. That's it. You call that a temple? Who are you then? The priest’s sidekick? Not a single member in that family has values. If they keep this going... My father will die soon. Stop bragging that he is your father. I’m your father. If you ever say that again, I’ll kill your mom and kill myself next. I swear on God! Why are you getting my mom into this? Because you wouldn’t care if I died alone. You have something to say now? I want to go to that house. What happened? - Dad choked. - Give him some water. I’m at it. Drink. Drink it. You’ve been checking on your son since the last 25 years. Now it’s my turn to check on my dad. Hey... Relax! Relax! You can check on your Prince. But I can’t check on my King, huh? Even if you’re in the same room with Ramachandra... He’s going to take you in right away. You’re his blood after all. That is what kept me from taking you to that house. Besides, would you stay away once you got in? You’re like a chewing gum stuck on the shoe. I’ll never let you go there. Who can get me in other than you? You’re going to take me there. - Me? - Yeah. Tomorrow. You better lose the T-shirts for a while, sir. Shirts will be comfortable. - Why? - Ugh, not again! My son-in-law is not too old to wear a t-shirt. Hey! What does a T-shirt have to do with it? Wearing a dhoti doesn’t make you any better. Calm down, doctor. Sir... Your shirt. T-shirt! Muscle! Strain! That’s the reason. No. But you don’t understand. You can wear shorts if you want. Your calves will get some fresh air. What about you? What? - Not again ! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hello... Are you okay? I’m okay, sir. He needs pleasant people around. Especially people unlike us. Like... That guy who brought him to the hospital. Why don’t you just call the same guy? Valmiki. Come here! Sir... See? Your son-in-law’s BP came back to normal as soon as I mentioned that guy. How is his presence going to help medically, doctor? You will see for yourself. In the movies, a child gets better when his mom or dad visits him. You believe in that stuff. But you don’t believe in an over qualified doctor like me. You question my credibility. - Sir... Don’t touch me! But you didn’t want him here last time. Answer him. I will. Didn’t you say that? I did, sir. But people change. Give me a chance, will you? Even doctors and drivers have kids. The doctor’s BP might rise from all the yelling. Go get him. He’ll be at work now. Ask him to take permission for a few hours. - It’s not a Government office. - Ask him to take the rest of the day off. What reason would he give? Just ask him to quit the job. Good-riddance! - That’s his bread and butter, doctor. - Send him to my house. I’ll feed him bread and butter. It’s no big deal. Let’s hire him. - Yes! You’re always giving some excuse whenever I want to see him. You don’t want him here, huh? - What’s your problem? - What’s your problem? - I don’t have any problem. - Then call him. Battery is low. I will... - Give me his number. I’ll call him. - I will only call him. Hello... Why are you stepping out? Because the signals are better there. Make the call quickly and my life will be better. Please. You must be really lucky. Yesterday you told me. Today they are only inviting you. Every fool has his day. Today is your day. Just because they invited you, doesn’t mean I’ll let you come. I’ll give them some lame excuse to keep you away. The doctor will call me as soon as you hang up. How do you know there’s a doctor inside? Where are you? Stop limping and look up. Hey! What’s with the doctor? He hated you last time. But now, he’s acting like some die-hard fan of yours. Relax! It’s an obvious reaction for someone who had his son kidnapped. You kidnapped his son?! It's him. This fatso?! Is he coming? Yes, sir. Bah! This doctor is killing me. Please come. “In a far off city named Vaikunthapuram” “Further away from the humongous palace” “At the shore of a sea filled with nectar There was a dais shining like the moon” “Lord Vishnu was seated with Goddess Laxmi on a throne adorned with black lotuses" “Being the holy saviour, he rushes to the rescue of the helpless Gajendra" “Here sets foot a new relationship in the abode of Vaikunthapuram” “Here comes the epitome of joy to a place weeping with sadness” “Here forms a new acquaintance in the abode of Vaikunthapuram” “Here he brings happiness to people flooding with tears” “Here holds an umbrella the sky for the cloud arriving” “Here sighs with relief the world for he will be a pillar of support” “Here welcomes the ravishing sun as the holy vermillion” “In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...” “In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...” “In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...” “In the abode of Vaikunthapuram...” Hey! Why did you give her money? Sir. My son. And my son? - Relax. I can't. - He’s at tea bunk. I’ll be there in a second. - I didn’t pay for the tea. - I will. He has my headphones. I’ll get you new headphones. You guys are criminals for kidnapping kids. Your father has been hiding you like a bride. I never got to take a good look at you. Come forward. He’s good. You’re a tough man. You didn’t just carry my son-in-law the other day. You carried the prestige of this house, ARK Company and our hopes. You work for my granddaughter, right? Yes, sir. - Is she paying you well? - Yes, sir. How much? I was promised 25K… I get 20K after all the exclusions. - I’ll pay you 50K. Come work for me. - Sir! Sir! He’ll be spoiled if you promise him so much money. What are you talking? You’ll be spoiling him if you gave him money. But we will be encouraging him. No, sir... - Work for me. - Sure, sir. Choose any room you like and find a desk and a computer. Okay, sir. - But what would I do? - Exactly my question. He will watch pictures of girls on the Internet. We can think about that later. Sure, sir. I have a lot of people to meet and loads of work to do. Time for you to leave. Go! Idiot. You need to be straightforward in everything you do. I hate people who lie. What? You just proved that you could insist on something you don’t do. You’re an inspiration to set of people, sir. Inspiration to others like me? Hello? Hey, ma’am! How are you doing? Didn’t you recognize me? Come. Sit. Sit. I was at the hotel for madam’s engagement, remember? Hi! How are you? All okay? Never mind, ma’am. I know you don’t remember me. - Sorry. Bad memory. - I don’t mind. Hero Chiranjeevi waves at his fans. Doesn’t mean he knows all their names. Same goes for you. You’re like a star. And I’m like your biggest fan. God! See? Even I have a good following. Oh... Hello. Of course. To be honest... You might look above average but you’re super sexy. - Really? - Promise. - Such a naughty boy you are! - Don’t hit your fans. Bro, come here. Tell me, bro. Just look at her… She’s super hot. I can't make those comments. Tell me what this is about. Let me know who her close relatives are here. I want to be friends with them. - Not possible. - Why? I’m her uncle. Sorry, sir. Going by your clothes, I thought you were the maid. What do you mean? You want me to suit up at home as well? How do you like the house? It’s wonderful, sir. But I don’t like that fact that he was attacked despite having all of you around. Why didn’t you file a police complaint? We did, man. - We did file a complaint. - You can be informal with me. You’re elder to me. The guy we’re dealing with is quite powerful as well. We don’t have enough evidence to support the case. So the police are afraid to arrest him. Why is that stopping us? We'll go and talk to him. - Shall we? - Yeah! Sir! Who are you? This is too much, Paidithalli. You want shares in his company. You want be the director of his company... You also want his position if you can have it. But you don’t know him. He’s the Founder! ARK! Who let you in? It was very hard to come here... We took flight till Rajahmundry and in a car till Kakinada. After reaching this place… It was uncomfortable. Sir, you can’t go in. Let’s go. Start the vehicle. No, sir. We travelled so far. Same feeling. That hand print… Who pushed him? My nephew visited your office and you asked him to get out in a video call. But you expect grand welcome from us? Impossible! My load is in there. - So what? I giving you 25 to 30 crores business every year. So what? Hey! I need to go inside. Don’t you get it, old man? Lift the load. Come on. Who pushed him? Who the hell do you think you are, barging into our port? Who pushed him? Who raised his hand on him? Was it you? You pushed him? - Tell me. - No… I didn’t push him. Did you push him? Tell me! How dare you guys push him. Pick up the stuff that old man dropped. Elaichi tea, sir. Especially for you. Towel sprayed with cologne, sir. It will cool you down. Who was it? Who pushed him? Bah! You’ve been asking the same question since you came. You seriously don’t think a bunch of people pushed him, do you? Only one guy pushed him and you hit him long back. He’s there. Where’s your boss? We need to yell his name out and call him. If you spare us the time that is. Sir!!! It can’t get any clearer than this. What sir is trying to say is… Your father stabbed his son-in-law. But there was no evidence. Case is hanging by a weak link now. I came and hit you guys. And there’s no evidence here as well. This case will also be weak. Let’s not play this game of tit for tat. Let’s sit down and talk it out. Sir strongly feels we shouldn’t resort to violence. What do you think? What are you looking at? Get up! You were quick on your feet a while ago. Now you’re looking sloppy. We’ll be late for our flight. Let’s go. Brother, you have anything else to ask? Oh!! This is sad! Our Prince won't talk... This Prince has nothing to say. Both of you are unique. Silent movie superstars. What is that? Isn’t this boat supposed to be on water? - It’s a car, man. - I know that. I was wondering what its name is. RR?! Sounds like a Rajamouli film title. Rolls Royce. Wow! Amazing contrast, boss! The car’s classy look doesn’t go with your appeal at all. Let’s take a selfie. Umm… Nice umbrella. I’ve seen people use it when it’s sunny or raining. But this is the first time, I saw someone use it to stab. I can’t stab artistically like you. I’m rough like that. You just got down the car. I just got into my character. Don’t be shy. I’ll see you around. Nice meeting you. Come. We’ll be late for our flight. But I have to admit, boss… It’s a great car. Hey, wait! He warned you in our port... I'll kill him. They will give us their company shares very soon. Where will they go? Go. Go. Don’t ask silly questions like where and how he got stabbed. They’re not middle class like us. They belong to the elite. Ammu! You’re wearing a cute skirt after so long. Dear… Pops. - Who is he? - Bantu! My Secretary. Hello! Then why is he getting all touchy? Key… Key… Car… You didn’t tell him? What does she have to tell me? Your daughter is not so interested in the groom. - Bantu! So? So, we took things a little too far. Oh, that was pretty shocking. Don’t tell them anything now. That is why we didn't tell you, pops. Why is he calling me pops? Ammu’s pops is my pops. Right, pops? Ammu! Come fast! - For now? - If possible, forever. - Come on! - Relax. Ammu. Sir… Hello, sir… How are you? - This is Jubilee Hills Road no. 36, right? - Yes, sir. - What are you doing here then? - I work here. What’s the job? They still didn't give me any designation. For now I’m browsing pictures of girls on the internet. What brings you here? I’m here to meet Mr. Ramachandra. Whatever it is, you can tell me, sir. I can’t discuss it with a kid. Commissioner wanted me to ask if Mr. Ramachandra needs security. He doesn’t need security while I’m around, sir. Listen… I’m like a one-man army. Who the hell are you to make decisions about his security? Come close. What? Actually... I am Mr. Ramachandra’s real son. It’s true, sir. I’m Mr. Ramachandra’s son. I swear on you! - Hello, officer. - Hello. What about him? They’ve been assuming he’s their son for 25 years. - Since 25 years? - Hmm. - When did you find out? - Recently. - Who told you? - A nurse told me. Nurse and that guy hiding behind the pillar… They replaced him with me, putting me into a middle class family. And replaced me with him, making him heir to a rich family. - Who told you? - No, Nurse told me. - When did she tell you? - Recently. - Why didn’t she tell you 25 years ago? - Because she was in a coma. - Why did she tell you now? - Because she came out of the coma. - Did she tell you and you only? - Why would she tell everyone in the world? She should have told Mr. Ramachandra at least. - She was about to tell him. - Then why didn’t she tell him? Because she died before she could tell him. Do you want some tea? No... I need whiskey. I'll drink in the evening after my working hours. Okay. Bantu… Does anyone else know about this apart from you? No one knows, sir. I won’t tell anyone either. I’ll sacrifice. If you’re so sacrificing, why did you come to this house? Who else will look after my house, sir? Bantu… Keys. Reddy will kill me. I need to go to the office urgently. I’ll see you in the evening. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. What is she doing here? His fiancé. Why is she kissing you then? Because we are in love. - Does he know? - Come on, sir! Why would he marry her if he knew? Does Ramachandra know this at least? We were going to tell him and something terrible happened. Oi! Naughty boy, huh! Who is she? His nephew. - Why is she spanking you? - I don't know... She’s been flirting with me ever since I joined here. Now she is spanking me. Nice! You flirt with all the girls in this house. And he doesn't care about it. I can’t see this anymore. I’ll leave. Morning officer. - Bantu… - Sir… Sir, do you run a background check on the employees you are hiring? We do check. Then why did you hire him? What are you talking about? If there’s anyone in this house with the common sense and intelligence I do… It’s him. Very nice! - Oh man! I’m done with you. - See you again. How did it go, sir? It was horrifying. We assume all rich people are intelligent. But they’re just lucky. Good morning, sir. Hi, morning… Come. After you joined here we didn't speak properly. They said you went out. I was talking to the SP, sir. It’s about the attack. He was asking if you need security. I told them you don’t need any security. Security? We close our doors when there is heavy breeze. But what can we do if the storm is in our home. We have to accept it. When we are tough situations, we look to our family for strength. But when that family is your weakness... who do you look to? Bantu, even God needs an offering. Even a King needs protection. I don't want to tell him my problems and worry him. My son won’t understand even if I told him. There’s no point in telling them. And if I want to say something to my… All the greatest battles are with the closest people. The greatest battles are fought with the closest people. Bantu… What did my son-in-law say? He said a lot. Is he upset about the differences with my daughter? Of course he would be. It’s been 7 years since they had a proper conversation. Did he tell you anything else? He didn’t tell me anything, sir. But you just did. - Oh no! You can’t hold anything in even after all these years, huh? What? I won’t live for another 100 years to be patient. I need to know everything immediately. - Okay. - So what did he say? - He said something about his son. - Is he feeling bad? Hmm. He is a strange guy. Sit, sit. No one knows what’s in his heart. I want see him burst out in anger, I’ll die a happy man. I'll help you! You don’t need to die for it. Just because they are close with you... You don't work at home. You don't go to office. Just sitting outside and smoking. They are very innocent. This is wrong. I am the owner! My wish! - Get out! Get out! - Rowdy. Relax. He’s got something, man. Grandpa is giving him way too much lenience. Ramachandra treats him like a family member. We should be friends with him. Why do you want to mess things up? 1.5 lakhs expenditure everyday? We’re discussing accounts here and why are you hitting them? Because they hit me. - Why did they hit you? - Because they stole one lakh. Why did they hit you only? Because they gave me share. Give me that stick. For what? Because I have to hit them. Uncle! Uncle! No! You don’t worry. I’ll go get sister. What’s going on, Sita? What happened? Stop running and let him hit you... he will be satisfied. Yasu, uncle is beating me just because he said. What’s wrong, dad? Why are you hitting him? After finding out how much money he’s looting every day… What did you expect from me? Who told you? He told me. How do you know if its true? He will tell me only if it’s true. Oh, really? You speak only the truth, huh? Tell me. Why will he loot our money? We are paying him 10 lakhs salary every month. He bets a million rupees on a poker table. He’s a big player. Dad, you gamble? Only on the weekends. That’s it. Yeah. He talks to Priya on the weekdays. - Who’s Priya? - How would I know? Not everything you say is true. You have a message from Priya in the mobile you threw on the floor. It read ‘Call me when free’. What’s the big deal? She just asked me to call back. There is no controversy here. - Actually, she called you baby in the end. Baby?! She also sent a heart emoticon. In red. Don’t look, sir. Her pictures are on it. - Really? - Private. This is quite common nowadays. I don’t get why these people are over reacting. Why are you hitting me when it’s his fault? Where were you when all this was happening? What do you expect me to do? Find a girl for myself? - Please! - Hey! When will you women change? You hit your brothers just because you can't slap your husbands. They’re outdated. They will never change. Why is he running away if Bantu wasn’t telling the truth? Alright then. I’ll hear you out. Tell about me. Isn’t that be too much for the day? You come with me. Father! You tell me. You don’t get along with your husband. Bantu! Come with me. Dad! How do you know? You shut your room door the first time I was here. I knew it right away. Wife and husband go through a lot of stuff. They will shut and open doors as they please. If a newlywed couple close the door… It means they have something personal to talk about. But if they still shut the door after 25 years… It means they don’t want the world to know they’re not on talking terms. He comes home at 6 pm dot, no matter how busy he is. So he’s implying that his life revolves around family and work only. And when a man is trying so hard, it means… He definitely did something wrong in the past. What do you think that is? Revati. She was his Secretary 7 years ago. She resigned only after a month’s duty. Back then… The sad part is everyone knew about this. But everyone pretends like it’s nothing. Including your father. You think telling the truth makes you great? When kids don't eat food... Their mother will tell them a scary story. Is that wrong on her part? Try and love someone. You will know what a lie is worth. That mother also tells her grown up kid that he’ll fall sick if he doesn’t eat. She won't lie to him. You’ll know what a lie is worth when you love someone. I get it. But you’ll know how strong you love is, only when you tell the truth. It might be tough. But a relationship built on truth stays solid as a rock, sir. It’s 5’o clock. Time for me to go off duty. Does this mark the end of this episode? Or is it ‘To be continued’ tomorrow? Go! See you tomorrow. See you, madam. She is not educated like you... Or beautiful like you. Or superior to you in any aspect. Maybe that is why I liked her. Because of my inferiority complex. Is it my fault that I try to be my best? Is that why you are hurting me? Have I ever compared myself to her? But don’t I deserve a sorry? After all these years. Earlier, you would try to prove that you are the perfect match for me. Now you are just trying to prove you’re not doing anything wrong. Why, Ramu? Why? Why do you have to prove anything to me? Be yourself. Just be your true self. There’s nothing I’d want more. Hey! I was scared, Yasu. To look into your eyes and talk to you. I was scared. For the things I've done... How do I make it up to you? I’m sorry. Sorry, Yasu. I’m sorry. Sorry. - Hello… - Why isn’t my daughter reacting? Don’t ruin the moment with your curiosity. Give them some time. Sorry. I’m sorry. Sorry. They are hugging each other. Then close your eyes and let me eat my dosa. Sita… Hmm? Shall I tell you something mind blowing? ARK brought Ramachandra into this house. He made him the clerk and soon the CEO. Finally made him his son-in-law, only for him to torture us ever since. He brought home this new guy now. And this guy has only doubled the torture. That old man brings someone home and that guy gets us into trouble every time. What if we brought someone home? That guy will be on our side then. We can loot a huge sum of amount. But who do we call? Sudarshan? She can handle him easily. He's a pilot... Actually another guy planned this meeting. He is Paidithalli. He alone can handle all of them easily. Paidithalli... But he is from Berkley. Mr. Ramachandra already said we don’t want this deal, right? His son was looking hesitant. So he had to do it out of courtesy. But he didn’t completely want to reject the deal. So I called him back to discuss it. Let’s see what they’ve got to offer. Besides, if he goes on rejecting everyone… We mean… Did they send you to say 'No'? No matter what, I will make sure they say 'Yes'. She can’t do it alone. I have to go. Ramu… To hell with the company. You sit down. - Yasu, I have to go. - I don’t care. You are important to me. Okay? Sit down. Wives often push their husbands to earn more, son-in-law. A wife who asks her husband to relax is a rare sight. I know who can deal with them. Good sign! Hold this, sister. I didn't zip up. Put it on me. Suit looks good. - Valmiki… - Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Why are you all decked up? Relax! Permission granted by Mr. ARK? I’m wanted, Valmiki! Thank you. We have made all the arrangements to buy shares. Hello! Who are you? "The saviour is here" "He brought showers to the barren land" "The saviour does what he does best" "He has given us the hope of new beginnings" "The saviour is here" "He brought showers to the barren land" He’s at the port, the Board meeting and basically everywhere. "I want to follow you" "I want to follow you" "I want to follow you" Madam is like your sir’s speaker. Is he like her mic? This is way too many people for a meeting. I want to hear from only one of you. Fine then. I’ll leave. "Why don't you stay?" "This heart belongs to you" "Why don't you hug me tight?" "Hold me closer to your heart" Is he playing the song for my nephew? Or is he making the most of this situation? "I wonder if the word beauty was coined after you" "I'm too shy to ask you for a hug" "Why don't you stay?" Now that she has left… We’ll have to see what he can do. I will show you what I’m made of. "I'll make you go crazy" "I'll make you cheer for every moment" "I'll make you go crazy" "I'll make you cheer for every moment" It’s time for you to play a Pawan Kalyan number. Situation doesn’t demand it, Mr. Sitaram. His songs don’t need a situation. We’re demanding it, right? Hey! Welcome to Vividha Bharathi’s special telecast. Upon the request of Sitaram, brother-in-law of Kasiram from Kakinada… Here’s a song from ‘Gabbar Singh’. "What are you guys looking at me for?" "Start playing the drums" "That's right!" "Oi!" "Yay!" "Hey, girl... A life without you is like a spinning top without a thread" "Hey, girl... A life without you is like a cracker slipped into water" What was that? Get down. Idiot! Is this a Board room or a Ball room? Are you being an angry bird? You want to buy the shares Paidithalli? [speaking gibberish] I'm gonna tear these shares. Hey! Do you know who signed that? Do you know who he is? Do you? (‘Abbanee Thiyyanee Debba’ song playing) Your song? It’s you? You? Mine? It's mine. We covered megastar’s song too. His timing is amazing. When will they change? Why is everyone running away when he hit one person? Shall we go? I feel something is missing, Bantu. Incomplete? But I’ve played such a versatile compilation. Did you miss the dialogue? Paidithalli! Father is unwell. Mother can’t go to work. Grandpa is getting older... Grandson is young. Just because you have cars and roads are empty… Don’t come here whenever you want. They have a brother. He will stand in your way. How did that sound? - I feel like whistling. A whistle isn’t enough. We need blasting background music. Slow motion… Things flying in the air… We need lot of special effects to it. I’ll plan it... Let's go. - Yes! - What happened? Son-in-law, Bantu hit this one out of the park. It’s a sixer! Dear, I’m throwing a party tonight. And I’m going to drink. That’s all. Brother, stop it. Do you have any desi music instead of this English music? Wow! That sounds great. Whom do we talk about? Reddy? His life is boring. Sekhar? No ways... I'll tell about myself. “Bantu was a well known dude in his area” “He had a bunch of guys follow him everywhere” “They got on their bikes one night for alcohol” “They crashed every possible store for alcohol” “There she was, shining like a beer in silk a saree” “Tempting me like a packet of hot biryani” “Standing on the terrace, oh she was like the moon” “Her beauty got me high, without having to booze” “While she was hopping around like a deer” “Her earring fell down and it stuck my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Every time I eat betel leaf, I think of your scent” “Your red blushing cheeks take over my mind” “Every time I wear a floral shirt, you bloom like a button” “You barge into my heart and create chaos inside” “When the bulb in front of my house flickers” “It seems like you’re winking at me naughtily” “When my drapes are stuck in the door hinge” “It seems like you’re pulling them and gives me goosebumps” “Like a snake swaying to the snake charmer’s tune” “I follow your track as your anklets begin to clink” “You go around like you don’t care, sweetie” “You hide and peep from a corner” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” “Oh boy! She blew my mind” “Oh boy! She stole my heart” This house provided us a living. It fed us through all these years. And when they welcomed you to this house with open arms… What did you do? You got into a brawl with a rowdy. You kidnapped a little kid. You blackmailed a millionaire. You also started flirting with their future daughter-in-law. Someone like you don’t deserve a place in any house. Get out. - Valmiki. Stop calling me Valmiki. Haven’t I taught you better? I’m your dad! So call me that. Get out. You must be tired of telling the truth ever since you were a kid. Take a break. When you were born, it only took me 25 minutes to bring you downstairs. But it took you 25 years to climb back to the top. This time I am pushing you There’s no way you can climb back up. Impossible! Relax! Yes, ma’am… I am coming. Thank god it’s over. Why are you sad, Bantu? This is what we’ve been trying to tell them. Even I’ve been trying to tell you something. Did you tell your real parents the truth? I’ll never tell them. Then there is no point in going to that house. I don't get it. Did I leave all my problems? It feels like I left an blank answer sheet in examination hall. Those papers state that half of your company shares belong to me. I want you both to sign on the papers and send them to my farmhouse with your son. If you don’t, I’ll send your niece’s dead body in an hour. If you don’t seek the police, it will just be a kidnap. But if you do... It will end up being a murder. Brother-in-law… Kasi! Get up. Brother-in-law... It was thrilling to loot someone’s money without their notice. But I didn’t know it’d be so burdening if they gave up the money willingly. I can’t carry it around. I don’t know how to repay you. I can’t believe you gave up your wealth for my daughter. She grew up right in front of my eyes, Kasi. Isn’t she my daughter too? Calm down, Kasi. Raj… Raj… I don’t want you to go. Your family has already done a lot for us. I can’t forgive myself if anything happened to you. - I will only go… Give it to me. - Uncle, he asked me to get it. Come on. Give me the money. It’s okay. I will convince them. He’s right, sir. Let him fight for his daughter. You can’t do it. Come here. Sir, tell him. Raj is innocent... Paidithalli is a monster. He doesn’t know anything about the outside world. I know how the world works. You guys don’t know me at all... None of you do. I smoke a cigarette and throw it in uncle’s balcony. Every day! I have a few drinks and grow money plants in those bottles. Did you know that? No, you don’t! I like her… I like Nandu... You don’t know that. I don’t want to get married to Amulya. You don’t know that. None of you even bothered to ask. And no one’s ready to listen. You always complained about me not expressing myself, right? Here I am, expressing myself. Hear me out. It’s my mother’s wealth. And she’s my girl. I only have to go. Son… You’d be humiliated if I hit you, uncle. Bantu... Kasiram's daughter is kidnapped... They are demanding company shares. They are asking for Raju... They'll kill him... - Please do something. - I've no connection with that house. - Bantu! listen to me.. - Relax. I thought you’re my savior. But you’re also hitting me. I’ve had a bad day so far. What happened? When my brother-in-law heard the good news about Bantu getting kicked out… He decided to settle 2 things. Mr. Chalapathi Rao didn't agree to sell his farm. He decided to threaten him. Second, he wanted to kidnap your girl and manipulate you for the shares. My nephew was drinking. Few goons were playing the game ‘Tiger and Goat’. We were going to receive 500 crores worth shares in 15 minutes. Our men were looking at the road, hoping this would change their lives. Brother-in-law was preparing barbecue. Everything was going to plan till then. But at the same time… A tiger has arrived. The goat died. He's a miracle worker He is strong willed He sorts things around the city He doesn't give up no matter what He pulled the bull's horns and played a tune with them He pulled the bull's horns and played a tune with them When everyone was terrified of the demon like banyan's benches He challenged the devil itself for a face off When there was a monster at the carnival teasing girls… He set his ways straight for a lifetime. There were no knives in it. None of our men either. When a bunch of boys were drowning in the flood He swam against the stream and pulled them ashore He will show up wherever you dare him to be He will make sure you don't return in one piece What about your brother-in-law? Even if it's a hundred pound fish... He will drag it to the shore single handedly His glance speaks volumes of his valor He makes the ground beneath you tremble with fear It’s actually a good song, Naidu. He's a miracle worker A man of wonders from the North He poked me with his mischievous gaze When he makes her feel safe from a bunch of rogues.. You can see a sparkle in her eyes. Its okay. I’ll take you to the hospital. When you had the intention to go… Why’d you tell your father you had nothing to do with us? Only during war… Everyone in the country unites despite their religion, caste and region. Similarly, only during tough times… Everyone in the family comes together despite their selfishness, hatred and revenge. That is why I left this family during a tough time. If he asked why they should sacrifice their wealth for her nephew… Or if she said it’s her wealth and that he is compelled to sign… These papers wouldn’t have been signed. They signed them because they agreed on something. After knowing, he gave up half of his company for his daughter? How can Kasiram hate his brother-in-law? You wanted to see Raj get furious and die a happy man. I made it happen and you didn’t have to die either. It was really hard for me to say I have nothing to do with this family. But it was more important for you guys to be a family. My King is happy just like I hoped. You can continue to visit your Prince every day. Valmiki… Shall we go? Let's go. Do you have anything else to say, Valmiki? Nothing much, sir. If my son said anything to hurt you… Kindly forgive him... That’s it. That’s it? That’s it, sir. That’s it? What!? That’s it, huh, Valmiki? That’s it, huh? He’s my grandson. My blood. My heir. How can you take him away and say that’s it? I heard the nurse talk to him in the hospital. Son-in-law, he’s your son. The heir to my fortune. I provoked the doctor because I knew the truth. I let him into the house. This house, wealth, his mother and father… I was wondering if he’d say the truth to claim any of it. But he didn’t. My blood’s boiling ever since I found out what he’s done. How come you’re not furious? No reason to be, sir. God has punished him already. The cramp in his leg soon turned into a limp. The joy of exchanging kids soon turned into fear. He hasn’t had a peaceful night in the past 25 years. Let him go, sir. You’re not angry with any of us. You’re not greedy for this wealth. Why did you come to this house then? It’s not only the parents that wish for their kids’ happiness. Kids wish for their parents’ happiness too. When I found out they were my parents after 25 long years… When I realized they were going through tough times… How can I just stand there and do nothing? I would never do that, sir. Everyone who cursed my dad behind his back… Should touch his feet when everyone is watching. My mom should be his best friend in the world. He shouldn’t blame himself for failing his son. Ramachandra is an epitome of success. He can never lose and I won’t let him. That is why I came back and did what I had to. I don’t need anything more than this, sir. Didn’t I tell you, father-in-law? Didn’t I? Didn’t I tell you how my son would be? He would be just like him. Just like him! Just like him. Just like him! Sir, calm down. Please. Calm down. Calm down, dad. Once… Once more. Please calm down, father. Come. Let’s meet Yasu. Come on. Father-in-law, we should tell her the truth. We should tell her right away. She will be really happy. Come! - No, sir. No… Listen to me. 25 years ago, he made the mistake of taking two kids away from their mothers. After nurturing Raj for 25 years... You can’t take him away from her and make the same mistake. No, sir. Let’s not correct this mistake. Let’s leave it here. God will look after the rest. You are the truth that I don't like. Because you are better than my son. I can't leave you... But today you saved him. Everything went good... Otherwise, I would have lost him. Bantu… Women accept complete strangers as their husbands. But they don’t accept a son they haven’t given birth to. I considered you my son the moment you went there in his place. Do I still have to accept you? I can never repay you for everything you have done. I’m returning what you just brought to us. Take it. I didn’t do it expecting something in return, ma’am. No please. Take it. Hey, Bantu. Please. A son should accept everything his mother gives him. - Did I do the right thing, dad? - Yes, dear. Whatever you do is the right thing. Did anyone ever ridicule Ramu for staying with his in-laws? Do you know why? Because your grandpa requested him to come home. Similarly, no one should call you Ramachandra’s son. Father… Yasu… I take back what I said the other day. That he was born a Prince. Let him climb his way up to the top. Get him a job and a quarters tomorrow itself. Why do you look dull, Valmiki? Half of the assets aren’t enough for your son? Shall I give him everything? Coach Raj just like you did with Bantu. He should become the CEO in 5 years. Do you like it? - Hi. We got it, bro. - Super. What are they doing here? Bantu introduced us. So he rubbed his bad luck onto you. What are those? Quarters... Assigned by the company, uncle. That is why we bought these quarters to drink. Dear, you belong in the Palace. It hurts me to see you here. Work hard for 5-6 months and prove your worth. You should become the next CEO. You should go back to that house. What are you talking about, uncle? I’m just beginning to relax. Auntie made me an omelet. I’m drinking and smoking without having to worry about it. Yeah! And this atmosphere... Feels just like home. Dear, I can’t catch up. Can you repeat it with better grammar? That is why I wrote this down. 25 years ago, when we were born… We wouldn’t have minded the crime. Put me in auntie’s ward and Bantu in my mom’s ward. It would’ve been perfect. It’s a sin, dear. We can’t take peoples fate into our hands. It wouldn’t work out even if we did. Tear that paper. Sir! What are you doing here? Someone stabbed Appala Naidu and thrashed his son. So they got scared and withdrew all their cases. I wanted to give the good news to Mr. ARK. I’m the one who stabbed and thrashed his son, sir. Hey! Hey! Don’t claim you’ve stabbed everyone in the world. Give some credit to the other criminals. It’s definitely telling the truth, sir. I know it. What do you do for a living? God, I hate this. No one believes me unless I wear this. I’m a doctor. Cardiologist. Show me your card. No matter how critical the emergency is… I swear I will never visit your hospital. Sir… Sir… Sir… My card… You’ve given the helicopter to my son-in-law anyway. It would be great if you give me your old Rolls Royce. Don’t revert the petrol bill to them, please. Why are you crying? I didn’t know it’s so hard to see your dreams come true. You mean him? Then you’re right. They give him a suit to wear... A girl to marry. And a helicopter to fly in. How can they be so happy after handing over such a huge company to him? I’ve been blabbering. Don’t you have something to say? I was forced to. Give me my card, sir. I’ll leave. - Wait... Go! - Thank you. I just realized why people need break in a moment of haze. Finally! “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Oh my god, daddy!” “Just don’t be my baddie” “Don’t be so hard on me” “That will make me sad”
