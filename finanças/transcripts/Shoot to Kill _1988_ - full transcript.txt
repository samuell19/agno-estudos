Let's check the flights that left after of verified, the airport, by insurance. The only valid impressions belong to the maid and family. And the lab will have the analyzes ready in a few hours. All right, thank you. What did you get? I looked for links with other cases of abduction and extortion of the last five years. There are 267 cases, with an equivalent method. It's the best you can get with the information we have. Then pick up the phone. Call the agent responsible for each of these cases. Tell us what we have and see if that makes him say anything. We do not have enough staff, to make those connections. Call eight more agents. There are 27 phone calls for each. Start with Homicide. He had an automatic of nine millimeters. Compare this with the profile, of the suspect. Caucasian man among 20 and the 40 years. I know he's already killed. It was too easy for him. It's been twelve hours. I think I should stop one little and try to sleep. I am fine. You look terrible. I read the reports. There was no way to know what would happen last night. What do you mean, Charlie? I'm saying, that these things happen. It happened to me. Remember that fucking Sausalito? Sometimes a hostage is lost and there is nothing else that can be done. I know this speech, Charlie. I invented it. Let's go. Follow me to the exit. Warren, he's leaving. Let this mess with you. This is becoming personal. It is saying that "I could have done that, that. " What matters is that he did everything I was right, I could not do anything. Go home. Sleep a few hours. I'll call you when I get to Washington. It's ok. Good trip. We've already started the phone calls. Great. Do you want them to call your house? I'm not going home. I will stay here. Good morning, the day is fine, for fishing. I think we were the first coming, right? Yes, I know it has happened before. Am sorry. I should have called, to the restaurant. But we were, in a terrible situation. Yes, I'm sure that It was terrible for you too, my love. I will try. I can not promise, but I'll try. I have to go. Bishop's Falls, Washington. A murdered tourist, on the motorway to Canada. And then? Shot of high caliber, left eye of the victim. Where the hell is it? Bishop's Falls? It's here, northwest of Spokane. I want to be in the next Book a flight to Spokane on our Flights page. Prepare an itinerary, to Bishop's Falls. It was Crilly who found the body. Ag.Stantin, Austin Crilly. Stantin's from the FBI. This way. You really are, a special agent? Since the last time, I checked, I am. Well, I'm a caretaker, when the mine closed... I'm going to the point, Dave. I saw the place where the gate I was worried and went to look. And I found a corpse stretched out there, flies the size of cars and... Whose cars are those, Mr. Crilly? Right. From the staff of the activities outdoors, fishermen. They stop here and meet up there. The guide meets with them there up at the camp. Guide Service. Jonathan Knox and Sarah Renell. Are you really special agent? This area is known as the best of the world for carp fishing. That's how we found it... Naked and with a busted eye. He was killed outside and dragged up here by the ankles. The killer wrapped the victim's head with this before taking your clothes off. Why would he do that? He did not want the laundry to be dirty. We know that the killer wore the his clothes, even his underwear. What the fuck... Do not Tread It! What? What is it? Burnt hair. What does that mean? All we know is, that our boy has long hair and a beard. This may be it. Sam! Sam! All right, Sheriff. What happened? He looks shaken... Sam, I need a description. of all who were, in yesterday's fishing group. I do not know any of them. Because? You do not meet these people? No, not at all. They go straight to the meeting area, above the mine. Did something happen? How many are in the group? Five fishermen and the Sarah guide, Sarah Renell. Dave, what happened? Can we call them? This Sarah, do you have a radio? There are radios in the huts, that remain on the course. They stopped calling me of Timber Falls. And they did not call? They can be in any point of this place. They sometimes go to places where no one was. Jonathan knows that. And the border is near there. Exact. I have the emergency helicopter, of the prontinho county. Not... this would alert the killer to our pursuit. Very dangerous. Could not use the helicopter, even if we wanted to. A storm is coming. No, there are no roads? Not one. Who can guide me? Jon Knox is the ideal. He's Sarah's partner. Mr. Stantin, listen to me, please. Sarah ... It's, in a way, special for us. Do you think he would kill any more of those people? I think so, Mr. Baker. Imagine living all your life. life in this place so far... of people. Thankfully there are wild places and forgotten by God like this, because they are the only ones where, Jon Knox feels at home. That's what I need... Another crazy. Jon is grumpy. It's just a little different. He is not very with people. He lived in those hills, like a hermit. Until Sarah appeared. They fell in love in five minutes. Did they fall in love? This complicates further, but the things Jon, it's Dave Arnett. I brought Warren Stantin with me, of the San Francisco FBI. I know this moment, is difficult for you, but I think we can work together and... Mr. Knox... I'm stalking a suspect of kidnapping and homicide. I need a guide. Do not touch me! I hear it's the best. Find another person. Hear me Knox, you come with me. If you refuse to help a federal agent, in the pursuit of a criminal, can be arrested, by obstruction to justice. Get out of my way. Is arrested! silly You have the right to remain silent. Skirt. I'll go alone. John, the man is right. He can not walk outside, Dave. He's just going to mess me up. Do not count on it. Outside there are no elevators, there are no lifts, nor cars, nor taxis. So why not go to a motel and let me do what I know. Mr. Knox, you only have one choice. Which is to guide me through of those mountains. There is only this alternative, the only that will allow her to help her friend. You're not a cop, will act under my authority, under my orders! Doubts? Great. I do not want to know whether the idea pleases you or not. If you try to go it alone, behind that face, I put you in jail, In a flash. Do you understand what I am? speaking, Mr. Knox? Where's his gear? In the truck. What the fuck is that? Socks heated, battery operated. It's fashionable. Did Ed Miller sell you this? Was. I knew it. 98 bottles of beer on the wall... Ninety-eight, ninety-eight. 98 bottles of beer... That's it! If you take one, go through 97 bottles of beer on the wall. 97 bottles of beer on the wall... Ninety-seven bottles...

Heavens, Sarah, I've been trying... I did not try anything. I thought I might have. Listen, Sarah, a storm is coming. Such a storm. Already arrived here and going toward you. You and your group have to Stay in the cabin, understand? Say that it will continue another day. Until the storm loses its force. I want to do another day on a trip. Stay there. Sarah, do not do this. Do not do it. He would not be so worried because of a storm. Ask what happened. What happened? It would not look like this because of Storm, Sam. Storm of those. No ... huge storm. It's ok. We're talking about a storm of those, Sarah... Five inches of snow, at least. Say you're alone and you can talk. I'm alone. Girl Renell, tell the Agent Special Minelli, from the FBI. One of the men, in your group is an impostor. He is a fugitive, sought by kidnapping and homicide. He is armed and dangerous, understood? Understood? Yes, I got it. Sarah, Jonathan is going there. He is guiding the Stantin, the FBI, to get to you. They should have a couple of days of delay, but with this snow, who knows? Stay near the cabin and the radio, Sarah. It will be hit by a front of diabolic bad weather. All right, Sam, I'll stick around. All right, Sam, I'll stick around. Heavens! Do you think she's with him? It seemed a bit strange, I'm not sure. Who is Jonathan? Is that your boyfriend, Sarah? And your boyfriend? Yeah, it's your boyfriend. Do not move. There. Sarah! She's dead. The river took her. Do not. If he knew the mountains, had fled alone. He knows nothing, so you need a guide. Let's go. She is still alive and we have to help her. Knox! Yeah, Sarah's handwriting. What this means: "Do you know me well?" Easy, Knox. Take it easy. What did this guy do? You talked about kidnapping and murder. That's what he did. How do you light it? It was not any of that, was it? No, it was not. So? He took a hostage in San Francisco. The wife of a merchant of diamonds. He killed her, after picking up the diamonds, just to give you a message Which message? That I should not have interfered. You did shit, you got revenge and She's going to die because of this! Listen to me the message makes sense. I'm starting to understand that guy. He only kills a hostage when, it loses its usefulness. Understood? Therefore, as long as we are close to Sarah will continue to live. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we will continue. Go get your backpack. They've come a long way. Now are only two, will walk faster. And we'll walk more Quickly yet. In two or three days will be on the border. You said he's going to kill you, when you do not need it anymore. This means that we have to to reach them before they reach Canada. Let's reach them before that. Wait there, Stantin. You're already tired. Is cold and the temperature will drop even more. A storm is coming. Do you understand? I do not have fear of a storm. You old ass. You can die here! And if it does not die, it will delay me, enough for Sarah to die. You only have one option: Stay here. You come with me, or is not going anywhere. Nonsense! You're not going to shoot. Have you ever killed a man? Have you ever prevented, an assault on a bank? I've been at the FBI for twenty and two years, Knox. I already faced the Mafia, the Ku Klux Klan, to the KGB. Listen to what I tell you. I'm qualified to pursue this face. You think you are, but it's not! All right, all right, I'll take you. But it will be good to hold the pace, because if I'm late and Sarah dies, I'll kill you. Sarah, slower. Stop! Sarah, wait. Wait! At the last minute, you have more and more. What happened, Sarah? You are crazy. See? I'm not crazy. Yes. If you take me to the border, I'll give you one of these. See? I'll give you that. But if you try this shit I'll kill you again. Your name. Say your name. Warren Stantin... Whenever you lose your breath, stop and say your name. It's ok? And if I'm too tired, to remember my name? For ten dollars, I remember you. All right, all right. He should have stayed in the cabin, when he had the opportunity. I have to go to the face of the stone and climb a chimney to the top. This will make us win, at least one day. They will follow the valleys, to avoid the storm. I have to climb the mountain and cross the storm. Therefore, when it gets dark, enter the bag, stay under my poncho and pray. Everything will work out. When I arrive at the border, I'll send the people to pick you up. God. Oh... What a stubborn face! Do not you have an ounce of common sense? Tie the rope in my waist, I make you come down. What is it... What is it making? Do you want to die? Tie this on the waist! I'll get you down! Do not. I'm going up. You're crazy! I'm going up. All right, force! I can not. Great. Now, will you tie it or not? Are you going to come down? I will. No. Fuck you, then. I'm going to Canada. Knox... Knox! Changed idea about going down, Stantin? No, I want to go up. All right, you stupid bastard, I can not waste the day arguing. Tie it on the waist I pull you. How do I know it will not come down? Because I said no, you son of a bitch! Now, tie while I am willing to! Oh, my God. Ready. You also have to help. I will not do the whole job. Very well, Climb as I pull. Come here and light this. It's ok. Why all this smoke? Are you sending any signal? The wood is moist, It will make smoke. Seriously? So we do not need, The fucking fire. What about? I'm tired of it. Do not want a fire, okay. We eat sushi! Do you want some? Damn! My leg. I have a cramp! Lay down! It's better? Yes Yes. It's soaked. When to start to warm up, it will get better. Take off the backpack. Search for something to dig Cave, Stantin, cave! Start digging or let's go die both! God, you gotta get this out! Your belly is cold! Get up! Oh... What happened? You've heard of us, country men, now? Jesus, what a smell! Do I smell so badly? Good... Time seems better ... I think we can recover some more time. Thank you for your help. You do not have to thank. How it feels? How am I? My great-grandfather died, eighty seven years old and I will never forget of having seen him in the coffin. So?
