This is the conclusive Kidnap and Ransom Report for Mr. Pierre Lenoir. Location Chechnya. Result positive. Contract was by AGP underwriters who insured the victim. Mr. Lenoir was abducted January 21st from Russian-held territory... by members at the Chechen Nationalist Militia. Their first demand was for 5 million U.S. dollars. My ability to negotiate directly... was subverted by local Russian military, who monitored me. After 36 days, I had negotiated the final ransom down to $750,000. Final proof of life was received midnight Wednesday, February 27th. The next morning, I was informed by the Russians... that I would be prohibited from personally delivering the ransom. Any confidence that they would deliver the ransom... and return the hostage safely had been dissipated. Tell your colonel it's his responsibility now. He's got orders. He fucks about... I'll be the least of his problems. Factoring the time-sensitive interests of the kidnappers... the limited communication available with London, and Russian insistence... that they alone deliver the ransom payment... I decided there was no alternative... but to give the Russians what they wanted. Knowing I'd retain possession of the ransom... I'd managed to contact the Chechens privately. We'd agreed to rendezvous at an alternative location. Transport options were limited. Drive! So I did the best I could. The group holding Mr. Lenoir... was responsible for 12 kidnappings over the past two years. It's a battle-tested guerrilla militia. They're armed, mobile, and extremely unpredictable. Mr. Lenoir was found to be in an excellent state of health... considering the circumstances. I don't know how much time we've got. Following a review of the ransom... Mr. Lenoir was released. The success of the extraction depended upon a timely transfer schedule. We were, however, not quite fast enough. Airborne! This place has gotten loud! Evac emergency RV. Repeat, ERV. Airborne, I have a visual! There are two dead trees in the center of the field. I'm 50 yards to the west! Don't give me shit! I've got injured cargo! Get your fucking ass down! Put her down! Go! This extraction didn't go well for the Chechens or our Russian hosts. As a result, my ability to function... as a kidnap and ransom consultant in this area... has been permanently compromised. Mr. Lenoir was examined by medical and per his insurance company's request... transported to Athens yesterday for surgical treatment. We have contracts with all three insurance underwriters... holding K and R policies in the West-Asian, post-Soviet republics. This area is clearly in a critical state of transition... and demands the most vigorous security precautions. - What did underwriters bill last year? - Total premiums? - $28 million. - And the ransom total? Paid out on policies? $26 million. Bloody hell. Set up some premium meetings. Wave the red flag a bit. Excellent job, Terry. Thank you. As always, outstanding. Sir. Where are we next? Pakistan? Colombia? Hello. - Peter, is that you? - Hey, it's me. It's about tonight. I'm shopping for dinner. Good news is, I'll definitely be back. Yeah? Go on. We've got to go to this thing tonight. The charity dinner. You're kidding, right? No. I'm getting screwed here. None of the equipment they promised has even left the States. I've got 60 guys running around with nothing to do. Something is really messed up. I gotta pin them down tonight. You really want to put me at a table full of oil executives? They're big boys. They can stand up to a little hippie like you. Can I tell them what I think of them? - If you really want to skip it... - No. I'll go. I'll be there. And I'll be on my best behavior. Great. Thank you, Alice. I mean it. I'll borrow a dress from Norma. Get Sandro to drop my tux by the airfield before he picks you up? Yeah, don't worry about it. Please don't leave me hanging with those people. - And be careful. - I love you. Peter, what's happening? What about the equipment? It's taken care of. I'm meeting with the guys from Quad Carbon tonight. His mom says he was the same as a baby. She's right. - Hey, baby. - Peter, thank God. I was worried about you. - I said he'd make it. - Hi. - Let's find our tables. - We'll see you inside. Look at you, all decked out in Norma's duds. It's my debut as a corporate wife. Whatever it is... it is working. I dress like this all the time now. You ought to come around more often. - I guess I got some making up to do. - I guess so. Oh, my beautiful darling. I just want to know what's going on. - Nobody called? - No. I was there all day. - Hey, y'all, sorry we're late. - Where is everybody? Nobody called you? Are you shitting me? Fellner, Buddy and their gang left for Houston this morning. Peggy said if he was going, she was going. I guess all the girls did. So it's just us. Better late than never. So, Ivy tell you? Houston. All of them. Fellner chartered a plane. What's in Houston? New money. Peter, look. How did it get so bad so fast? Come on, man. Where have you been? Trying to build a dam. You gotta look around now and then. You're building a charity project. The company sees you as humanitarian window-dressing. Quad Carbon came looking for a lucky break and we got nailed. We've a billion-dollar pipeline that hasn't made a gallon. Oil prices are going through the roof. We can't take advantage of it. You know, market closed today... Quad Carbon stock down 10 and falling. The vultures are circling. Which vulture's in Houston? It's Octonal. The only ones big enough to get this thing on track. Peter, look! Peter, look! Maybe you missed it, but this happens to be a big deal for me. I think I know that. You sure don't act like it. Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's a sign we should go home. You tell me. This all falls apart, this goes away, what was the point? - Point of what? - I don't know. How about everything? How about Africa? How about Egypt? How about Thailand? How about eight years of shit postings? Of working for assholes. Of working with somebody else's bad ideas. Wait, I don't get it here. Suddenly the last eight years, that's all shit now? Is that what I said? I thought we were doing what we wanted to do, living our lives together! That's not what I said. It's not just a job. This is everything I have prepared for my entire life. If Jerry's right, if it's Octonal... they come in and take over. I'm fucked. I wouldn't get too upset about it. Maybe Octonal wants a dam of their very own. They don't build, they kick ass. They don't care about people. It's all profits. What is the surprise? You wanted to work for an oil company. I don't work for an oil company. That's not it! I'm building a dam that will save lives! You are building a dam so an oil company can get a pipeline contract. - Who cares who pays for it? - Apparently, no one! You're drunk. No, Peter. This isn't us. - Let's just go home. - That's great. That is just so supportive. You don't like this place either. - I like the project. - I don't have a project! Then find a fucking project! Oh, damn. Alice, use your talent, your experience. Look, there's got to be 25 agencies working down here. There's food projects, health care... any of them would be thrilled to have you on staff. I don't get this. You've always hit the ground running. I'm sorry I'm not bouncing back fast enough for you. Five months, you haven't even started to learn the language. I'm not getting pregnant again in the Third World. No, not Africa. We're not gonna bring that into this. - That? - Yes, that. When the hell are you gonna move on? It's over. It happened. - It wasn't meant to be. Get over it! - I don't want to move on! Well, I have! And goddamn it, I'm right here! Right now! My whole situation is falling apart and somehow we're back to this agenda. I am not an agenda. You know what? Go home. I'm serious. Take a break. Well, it's what you want. Isn't it? I never said that. All right. Then I guess it's me. No, no, no. Ted, tell Octonal how much local support we've got down here. What can I say? We're in Houston... looking for help. Octonal has their own way of doing things. I'm not the only one who'll fight. If that's a threat, I'm not sure what it is. - You lose sight of where you stand... - Look. Ted, you're breaking up. Don't lose track of where you stand in the food chain. I got people here who've burned their bridges to work with us. I can't hear you. Can you hear me? - Ted, when you're ready. - What am I... supposed to tell my people? Tell them Quad Carbon's finished. Octonal is taking us over. Tell them to get their résumés out. I'm headed for the office. I'll call on a landline. Beatrice, thanks for coming in on Sunday. Call Ted Fellner. Say I'll be at the office in 20 minutes. I gotta take the long way around. Right. Oh, fuck this. Oh, my God. I don't believe this. Fuck! Oh, my God! No! It's a telephone! Just a telephone! I'm not doing anything! I'm not doing anything! Jesus Christ. All right, look...! No, I just need my briefcase. I'm not part of this. I have some really bad news. You ought to go inside and sit down. It's about Peter. This morning there was a roadblock... and these guys in ski masks... They had guns and they took him with a bunch of other people. He's been kidnapped. Do you understand what I'm saying? We got a call from Tecala this morning. You're not sending me there. - I think if you hear me out... - I just got off the plane, okay? I need you down there. I'm not good at the moment. Consider this your first management assignment. The first of many. We all get rattled. It's not the first time. That was kind of my point. - Sir. - Hey, Henry. I'm on my way to the airport. I'll call your mom, see if her and Michael can make it up this weekend. I'll call her. What time's kickoff on Sunday? Two? Yes, sir. I was really looking forward to it. Better get back with your mates. Yes, sir. All right! Can I speak now? Because this is wrong. This is so wrong. I'm here to help the Tecala people. I'm here to build a dam. No, I don't work on the pipeline. I'm here to build the dam at Chimaya. - For the pipeline. - No! - Yes. - Listen to me! Not...! Just listen to me. To stop the flooding. Can you understand that? Didn't you hear me? I don't work for the pipeline! I'm here to help the people! You are a prisoner. That's it. This whole box is just... We bought some albums. I was gonna organize all this... and I just never got it together. Oh, God, what's that? India? Alice, stop. We need just one good picture of his face. Sorry. I'm the one who's sorry. I don't understand my country anymore. No, it was completely random. He was out in the barrio. Anything can happen out there. They steal your car, money, whatever. No, we don't know a damn thing. Nothing definite at all. Let me call you back. You're saying we don't know? At this point, we don't know. He was kidnapped, Jerry. - Look... - Taken at gunpoint in a roadblock. Twenty-five people saw him drive away in the truck. I don't know, maybe it's me, but that sounds pretty definitive. Alice, it's your sister-in-law again. Janis, did you get the flight? Welcome back, Mr. Thorne. How long will you stay this time? Mr. Peter Bowman. Let's have a look at you, mate. Janis! Alice! Go over there. Sandro will get your bags. - Tickets, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Here. There. Please don't lose my luggage. There she is. There's a guy waiting for you. He wants to talk to you about Peter. He says it's important. - How are you? - How do you do? I was against this, but they insist. I hope it was all right, letting him in. - What's Luthan Risk International? - He's a negotiator. - Shall I go with you? - No, I'll take care of it. Hi. How are you? I'm Peter's sister. Can we help you? Terrence Thorne. How do you do? Considering the circumstances, we're all right. How do you do, Mrs. Bowman? I'm with Luthan Risk, a consult... I have one. Your card. We're based in London. I'm with our Security and Crisis Response Unit. Sorry for just appearing. We're the K and R consultant for Quad Carbon. K and R. What is K and R? Kidnap and Ransom. You just flew in? Correct. Last night. Spoken to anyone at Quad Carbon? London may have. All I've seen is an employment dossier. I'd like a proper file. I've got questions. I'm sure you do. I'll try and explain. This is a game. It's a game you play whether you like it or not. For you, it's emotional. For those holding Peter, it's a business. The sooner you get comfortable and objective about that... the easier this will be. Hostages are taken all over the world. Sometimes, it's purely terror... Sometimes it's political, for propaganda. Down here, it's simply about money. So... where is Peter? Where is he now? Probably in the mountains. Likely he's been taken by the ELT. Look... I just got off a plane. Can we back up a little bit here, please? This ELT, this group... who the hell are they? And how can you be sure they're the ones who have him? A land-reform movement. Revolutionaries. Initially, there was a political agenda. But you must understand... today's version of the ELT is a different animal. Twenty years ago they were a struggling Marxist group in the mountains. The end of the Cold War dried up the money from Moscow... and the ELT had to find a way to support itself. So they got into kidnapping and made millions. Then they realized they were sitting on a bigger gold mine. Behind Colombia, Tecala's the largest supplier of cocaine. The ELT had weapons and an unlimited supply of poor, illiterate soldiers. They came in hard and fast and they took over the drug trade. Whatever agenda they started with has been completely perverted. Did you know that when you moved here? Can we get practical for a second? Can you explain how this works, step by step? We wait for contact, they make a demand, we negotiate. What's to negotiate? Everything. We pay too fast, too much, make it look easy... we won't get Peter... but a message thanking us for the down payment and asking for more. All we want to do is find a number. A dollar figure that gets him back alive as quickly as possible. No. Let me clarify. This is not about rescues. It's not about bringing anyone to justice. Relying on the police is dangerous and the army is no better. The last thing we need is heroics, so we rely on nobody local. And the embassy? I'm waiting for their call. The U.S. mission here at the moment... is to try to break the ELT... and switch the economy from drugs to petroleum. Peter doesn't fit into those plans. The embassy cannot help you and they know it. All you'll get is a sympathetic smile and a pat on the back. How long will this take? In truth, I don't know. You need to settle in for a long haul. Nothing goes quickly in Tecala. But they know what they're doing. He's a valuable commodity... and it's in their best interest... to keep him healthy. Would he ever leave and not tell you where he would be? No. What are you getting at? How is his health? His health's always been fine. - Medication? - No. Allergies? No. Nothing. Chlorine and strawberries. A blood vessel popped in his eye, he's taking drops. And he's very prone to ear infections. And emotionally? Can he handle this kind of stress? What kind of stress? I don't know, Frank. He doesn't know. It could be one week, it could be six. She's Alice. What can I tell you? She's still trying to save the world. So who are you? I mean, people who do this. Are you lawyers, foreign service, what? Some law enforcement, some intelligence. Mostly military. Which are you? I was a soldier. What kind? British army. - You sound Australian. - I am, yeah. I was at home but we don't get a lot of action, so I went to England. SAS. Special Air Service. Special, meaning what? Special Forces? Right. Man, she is a trip, huh? They get on? With Peter? She drives him crazy. Sometimes I think we've been bouncing around so he can avoid her. I read that in the dossier. The bouncing around. He shouldn't have been in that convertible. That stupid goddamn car. Tell me, what's with all the scorpions? This house. It's insane, isn't it? Some busted drug lord, El Escorpión, built it for one of his mistresses. Peter said he had found this enormous house... that nobody wanted because it was supposed to be cursed. One of the maids comes every Monday... and sprinkles holy water around. So maybe it is cursed, all that bad juju. So, this is your life. This is what you do. Go into people's houses, tell them how it is. That's part of it. Try to figure what they're like, how they'll hold up. Isn't that what you're doing? I'm on your side. So how am I doing? You know, for the bereaved spouse? Your husband isn't dead. He's alive. I'll do everything to ensure he gets home safe. This won't work if you bullshit me. I can see that. So we'll be straight up? That's exactly how we'll do it. Sorry. God, you'd think I'd been gone for a month. Want some wine? You know I don't drink. So, where were we? Oh, shit! I like this! He's loco. Don't be afraid. We're not gonna kill you. The competition arrives. I heard an ugly rumor you were around somewhere. I thought you'd gone civilized and unsocial on us. What's this? Face-lift? Yeah, I'm doing one side at a time. You good? He looks bad, but he's working. - You celebrating? - Life, liberty... and the ability to purchase clitoris. - Jesus! - Thank God you're here, Terry. Because the quality of conversation has been... Bloody appalling. So where was it? - Someone said you were in Turkey? - No. Not Turkey, Chechnya. - With the Frenchman Lenoir. - Keeping updated? My guys turned that one down. It's a job Wyatt's outfit would take. - Thanks. - Thought you were retiring. Yes, I was, but Inherent Risk rang me with a sob story. Could I, please? Old time's sake? Yeah. What are you doing? I'm working on the biggest thing down here. He's doing the Italian. Calitri. Banker. Very pleased with himself. I can tell. And Ian has you off in fucking Chechnya alone. That's why I left. Luthan Risk doesn't care about you, you know that. Thanks. You still got cops on the payroll? - Yes. Judges too. - Run some names for me? That top one is this client's driver. Shouldn't be a problem. For a price. Will we ever get a fucking drink? - Somebody's kidnapped the barman. - That's all right, mate. My shout. Bloody hell, that's just like mine. It is yours. It is mine. You... Hey, old mate. It's good to see you. Alice, I can't tell you... how shocked I am. You get my wire? How are you? - Janis Goodman, Peter's sister. - Ted Fellner, his boss. Let's step into my office. I was in Houston, got this call, I couldn't believe it. I flew here last night. We've got everybody... trying to access the information to make informed decisions... and make the right decisions quickly. Please, sit down. Would you like some coffee or tea? No, I think we're fine. Where's Mr. Thorne? The guy from Luthan Risk. Right. There's been a change. What kind of change? We think it's best for all of us, under the circumstances... to go with a local representative. - You don't want to use Luthan Risk? - What circumstances? There's no insurance. No one at Quad Carbon has been insured for kidnapping since July. Some idiot was cutting costs and didn't realize what they were doing. Alice, honey, please. This could be any one of us. We're doing our best, talking to Octonal, getting their input. We're hoping they'll cover this, but at this point... Don't they have to? Their position is they're buying a pipeline, not the company. Their position? How do they already have a position? This just happened! Could you tell me where Quad Carbon stands in all of this? Quad Carbon is evaporating. They're selling off what they can. Just a little late for miracles. So you're all out of work? It would seem so. Who's this? This is Arturo Fernandez. Señora Bowman. He's been our security coordinator for years. He's well-connected and experienced. If you give us a few minutes, you'll realize... just how lucky we are to have him working with us. Mr. Thorne, you're leaving so soon? Perhaps next time we can go dancing. Boy, did you have me fooled. - I was just about to call you. - Where, from the plane? You stood in my house and told me I didn't have to worry anymore. We thought Quad Carbon was still a client. We can't be the client? I'm sorry. It's not good for us either. Us? You. You stood in my kitchen and told me my husband was coming home. Quad Carbon is out of business, okay? Octonal spends 40 million a year on K and R insurance. My company has 30 percent of that. Octonal does not like conflict. Peter doesn't work for Octonal. That's the point. That's the way they want it. No Quad Carbon confusion. We're not even supposed to talk. - So this is you being brave? - No, this is me doing my job. It's good I came by then. Let you get that off your chest. I'm sure it'll all work out. They're giving us some local security guy... exactly what you warned me about. I don't make policy. Great. So when this is over and my husband's dead... and I'm suing them, you can tell the judge... you did all you could? Wait a minute. Wait! No, no. Wait! Listen to me, I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm sorry! I'm sorry to be like this but... you are the first... You are the only person I've met... who knows what they're talking about. So I'm begging you, I'm totally begging you to help me out. You asked me not to bullshit you. Right. I got a plane to catch. Alice, I'm sorry. We just had a call about Peter. They said a cell phone was in our car. They're calling this phone in 20 minutes. God, Alice. They have our phone number. Oh, my God...! Peter's alive. He's being held by El Ejército de Liberación de Tecala. He's in good health, but he's a prisoner of war. - They want $5 million for his release. - Oh, my God! Obviously, this is negotiable. They always start with a big number. He says that in order to make it better for Peter's care and food... and to prove to us that he's alive, they want to get a first transfer. As a gesture of good faith. As soon as possible. First transfer being what? 1.5 billion pesos. - Jesus! - It's only $50,000. Can I talk to him? No, I don't think so. This guy, he's gonna make one last contact. He'll let us know where to go for this. But, ladies... the important thing is that Peter is alive. This is very positive. It's very fast. A case like this? Very fast. - Honest. - Could you excuse us? - Sure. - Thank you. - I am not trusting him with $50,000. - What's the alternative? - You feel good about this? About him? - No! This all feels thrown together and out-of-control. - He's not the only one who does this. - You've been looking for two days! Let's wait for the guy in Miami. What? Five days? Two weeks? Want to comparison-shop? Peter's alive now! Peter is my little brother! I'm trying to be smart about this. I've never done this before. - I know. I'm just... - I know. I know. Where could I go? Ask him how long I have to be here. What did he say? Never mind. It's okay. It's okay. Lord Luthan is actually living in the Ukraine. In a sanatorium. Terry! - Welcome back. - Hello, Terry. - Pleasure seeing you again. - Indeed. Round at Westminster and back down to Greenwich, please. I'll have two of these, please. Here's to dodging bullets. We almost lost a $12 million contract over this Quad Carbon fiasco. Octonal got quite put off by the whole adventure. I'm sure you did, as well. Quite right to. I'll make it up to you, Terry. I will. So, what happens to these people? Who? The Bowmans. What happens to them now? Come on. They'll find a way through. We've got six firms on our backs. Believe me, somebody wants this case. Okay, who? Name a company, that doesn't have Octonal business, that you'd trust. Trust with your own family. They'll be fine. So look... I got a trip to Bangkok needs doing. Three days. Strictly management. Wave the flag, talk to a few people. After that, I thought you might want a trip to the beach at Phuket. Forty... Forty-three, forty-four, forty-five... If you're handling the 20s, it's 50. - And if you're handling 50s... - I know. Don't! Forty-seven... Forty-eight... Damn it! Christ! Shit! This is ridiculous! - Hold on. How many did you have? - I had 50. Why does everyone keep asking how much I have? Please, Mr. Fernandez. Come on, Janis. Calm down. Are you expecting someone? No. Watch out! This guy is so... Maybe it's Elio. - Whoever it is, out! - Please, Mr. Fernandez... let me handle it. What are you doing here? I wanted to apologize. I thought you did that already. Oh, my God. It's you! - Hello, Janis. - What do you want? I wanted to say I'm sorry about things. Great, it's just that... we're in the middle of something. I understand your reluctance, but I'm offering my services. Haven't we done this? - But your hands are tied. - They were. What about your company? I'd be doing this alone. Señora! Señora, please! It's okay. It's all right. What's all this? We're putting together a payment. - What kind? - For Peter. A good-faith payment. - Good faith. - We're getting a proof of life. - Who put this together? - I insist... Hi, Terry Thorne. Nice to meet you. You can't come in! What do we got? We got three guys with guns and a shitload of money. Holy assholes, look at this! - Tell them to put the guns down! - All right! I asked you not to come in. These ladies don't understand. But you understand! I get this. You come back later. Later? Like when the money's gone? There you go. I get that too. Okay. All right. That's what I'm doing. I do this for a living. I do this all the time. This is my job, you know? And you never buy a proof of life. You don't know what you're talking about! And you don't pack money in the client's house except in an emergency. And you don't wave guns around people you're helping. Don't do that! Put your gun down or I'll blow your head off! - Now! - There it is. Look, there it is. Just calm down. Do it! There you go. What are you gonna do now, asshole? Alice... ask him to leave. What? Thank them for their help and ask them to leave. Me? You are telling me? - You're taking the case? - Yes. Enough! Leave, now! Mr. Fernandez... I'd like you to go. - You heard Mrs. Bowman. - I'm not going anywhere. You are. Now! Can I make a suggestion? I can hardly wait. I think you should calm down, then look over and meet my friend. Arturo. Put the fucking thing down. Didn't you go legit? Dino. Let's go. You too! Right now! Okey-dokey. Let's get this all cleaned up. God! Jeez. When are you guys gonna put those things away? Have a cigarette, it might help. Sandro's going around again. Elio's ready. We're the talk of the town. - Complimentary? - You'd be flattered. - Where's Mrs. Bowman? - Check the kitchen. - Hey. - Yeah? That was fun. Yeah. Mrs. Bowman? Alice? Dino and Sandro are taking the dummy bags into town. Make it look good. We'll keep the cash here. I need to know, was there any kind of plan? A contact schedule? No. We were just waiting for another call. I haven't cried since this started. It's just... Hey, it's okay. It's just the tension. Finally, it just... It's okay. Why are you doing this? Nobody was going to take your case. Nobody any good, anyway. I know. But you came back. We have to do this my way, right? We'll do it together, but you've just got to... Even if it gets tough. You have to learn to trust me. - Morning. - How are you? We've been listening to this all night. Estúpido is right. What are you doing here? - Linda, you're smart, a good person. - I have no family. This is not your family. They are my family. - Let me be your family. - No. - They are my family. - They're not your family. Linda... please. Just help me. You can do it. Help me. - Who answered the phone? - Maria. I was in the shower. Janis stayed in case anyone calls. - Where did they hide it? - The Jesus with the purple robe. Under the cloth. - Did you get it? - It's good. We got radio frequencies, times to call. Wednesdays and Sundays. I'd like five minutes with you without your gun. I'd take your world apart without breaking a sweat. I want my shirt and spoon. Aim that fucking thing at me one more time...! Big man! Show me how fucking big you are! I'll make you eat that goddamn rifle! - He wants the family. - Tell him to forget it. We represent the family. Just do it. Do it. Put his wife on the radio right now... or we forget the whole fucking thing! Who is this? I said, I want to speak with the wife! Who is this? You can call me Tio. What's your name? Call me Marco. You're not making all the rules. We'll work with you, but we want proof of life or we don't pay. If there's good faith, it can start with that. Okay, Uncle Tio. - You're in charge now? - That's right. Good. Then you'll be responsible for the death of Peter Bowman. Do you understand me? You're responsible! - He's gone? - Yeah. Just get used to it. It's the way it's done. Goddamn it. I've never seen you smoke. I smoke when I play cards. Is that supposed to be reassuring? This is how it goes. Okay? They've come to us. We've established contact. This is all positive. Who do you care about? I told you to trust me. You said you could. Dino says you have a 13-year-old son. Yeah. Surprised? What if it was him? What if it was your son in the mountains? I'd find somebody I could trust and I'd do what they told me. So, what's your son like? He's quiet. Smart, you know. Seems to make good friends. Good rugby player. I see him all done up... and I think, God, he's just at the end of being a boy... and I missed it. Just haven't been there for him. You know, truthfully... we don't know each other. When we talk it's like he's on a parade ground. So he's a soldier like his dad. No, he wants to be a pilot and get all the girls. And his mother? Now, there's the soldier. I guess she'd have to be. Know how an English general's daughter gets back at Daddy? She marries an Australian. You never remarried? I took up the veil, you know? This job. You gotta have rhythm. You start moving, and... it just takes over. Name. Peter Bowman. Come. You stay here. - Hey! - What? Quiet! Whisper. You came today from the mountains? I'm Kessler. Eric Kessler. Peter. Peter Bowman. You know my name? I'm a missionary. You know something, perhaps... about my situation? Some news? Something? No, I don't know. Are you a hostage too? There's an Italian. Up the hill, at the farmhouse. He came a week ago. Is he your friend? No, I was brought here alone. What kind of camp is this? Once it was only for drugs... to make cocaine at the river. But now from the fighting... it's also soldiers. How long have you been here? You need soap for your feet? Maybe tomorrow I can steal some. How long have you been here? Nineteen months. They think I'm crazy. - Dover. - Hey, Terry, I'm really sorry. Alice Bowman, Dover McLoon, consulate officer. I know we have a meeting, but something's come up. - We've been waiting over an hour. - I know that. I really want to hear about your progress. I'm sympathetic. We all are. - But we've got a situation. - What kind? I really just think we have to reschedule. He's sympathetic? What the hell does that mean, sympathetic? The ELT let off three car bombs in the city. They've threatened the embassy. I gotta go issue a statement. - That's okay, mate, you stay safe. - Thanks. We gotta get out. They've had a bomb threat. - What's happening? - Just get in the car! - What's this? - Is it from them? Don't open that, Alice. - It's from them, isn't it? - Open it! Put your seat belts on. We're going to the hotel. - Just open it. - Not here! Okay, how about a nice big smile, you skinny motherfucker. Shit! Close the door. Take a seat. Just open it. Please, just open it. Is it a proof of life or not? Give me a minute and take a seat. It is. It's a proof of life, isn't it? Usually I do this by myself, okay? Just wait a minute. There's things here that they want us to see. Look, you never get a pretty picture, okay? His feet. He looks terrible. What happened to his feet? You said... that they knew he was valuable. That they would take care of him. What are you doing? This is it, right? The one he's holding? - Do you save all the papers? - This is good news, okay? This is good luck. It's what we've been waiting for. Now we're in play. All we have to do now is start talking specifics. Money. I need to know exactly how much I've got to work with. Go back to Denver and start putting the cash together. We're gonna shoot for $600,000. I'm hoping that's where we land. Thank you. Don't be a fool! Stop it! Calm down! It's nothing! You see up there? The farmhouse? That's where they've got the Italian. On the other side, down the valley. That is where they make cocaine. When you get home, you'll want to talk about this. I know. It's not restaurant talk. It's not for my friends or even for my kids. - Right. - Right. Turn that scramble phone on. Test it out straight away. If it doesn't work, I'll get something else. You're doing great. Thank you, Janis. It's not every soccer mom who gets her own encrypted phone, right? It's a lot of money, Alice. $600,000. He's not even sure. I know. I know you've got the kids, tuitions, your mortgage. I know all of it is impossible to ask. But you're our only chance. What if it's more? I don't know. But I swear, if it takes every day of my life, I will pay you back. I will. I'm sorry if I've been... It's just that I'm trying to get through this, trying to be... strong. He's lucky to have you. Don't worry. - What's that? - It's the alarm. The bell means the army is crossing the river on a raid. - Where are they going? - To protect their cocaine factories. It's becoming a war. What is it? Nothing. - What was that? - A message from ELT. It's got nothing to do with us. Three million dollars is the price for Peter Bowman. That's a ridiculous figure. This is not a businessman but an engineer here constructing a dam. You have to come down from that. Like this is a game. We are saying concrete things... and you are having us suck cock here with this bullshit? At $400,000, you're already over my limit. What you need to do is take that offer back and see... - What the hell are they bringing back? - It's a French helicopter. How would you know that? What's that? Marco, I've got very good news for you. I've got another $50,000. $50,000 changes nothing! I might as well walk across the camp... go into his cell, and blow his brains out. Alice. He's nowhere near Peter. - How do you know? - Look. That's the weather from when I talked to him on the radio. When it thundered outside, I heard it on the radio. There's no rain in the mountains. Peter's three days away. That means that this guy is in this city. Marco... if you are near Peter Bowman, get him and put him on the radio... so he can talk to his wife. We'll accept that as a proof of life. Over. Marco, do you copy? You must understand you're dealing with a single family... We know he works for Octonal. It's the biggest oil company in the world. He doesn't work for Octonal. Peter Bowman was here, subcontracting... - It's her. Alice. - Beautiful. I asked for 3 million, I come down to 2 million. This is an insult. He's losing faith in the family, especially the wife. This is bullshit. We can't be responsible for what he may do to himself! I think we just put a bullet in his head and sell you the body. I couldn't listen anymore. It's all right. You okay? People say things happen for a reason. You must get a lot of that, right? I had a miscarriage eight months ago. In Africa. It wasn't anybody's fault. It wasn't Peter's fault. Not like I didn't try to blame him... or blame myself, like I deserved it, like there was a reason. If I could just figure it out. I thought if I wasn't the one keeping control, everything would fall apart. And I thought that I could just... make it all happen. The places we've been, like Thailand... Africa... There's so much pain, you know? You can't possibly make any sense out of it. You can't push it away, even if you're paralyzed by it. What good are you? So you let it go. And now that you don't have control? It's like faith. Once you let go... how everything becomes clear. And all the stupid, stupid shit that I worried about. Everything I put her through. It's like, since the baby, I... Like everything I learned along the way somehow didn't apply to me too. You think I would have gotten the message. I gotta get through this. I gotta get home. Things don't happen for a reason. They just... happen. My daughter is buried in Africa. Who can explain that? What was her name? Mali. Mali Jasmine Bowman. It's a beautiful name. You know, nobody ever asked me that. Okay, Marco. We've got $475,000. - That is not a good number! - Marco, you've got to think about it. It is a good number. It's the right number. It's the only number. There is no company, no insurance. - You're dealing with the family. - This is bullshit. They need to think harder, like around $2 million... or they'll never see him again. If we can close at 500, then that's what we should look at. $500,000. You can forget it. The family's worked very hard. ...complete net worth and assets of this man's family. - It's just not possible. - I am trying, you understand? I am working my people. I am trying to make this happen. But I need something from you. You give me nothing, nothing! Marco, we got 600,000 U.S. dollars. 600,000 changes nothing. The maintenance alone for him is more than you are offering. If that changes nothing... then you'll have to come up with a number that starts to change things. If you go to 650, I will take that back to my people. You think you can get 650? Right, Marco. We're gonna close it at 650. Okay. I will go to my people... and I'll talk to you again on Sunday night. No, it's all right. It's fine. I'll be over here. Peter. - Peter, what are you doing? - Be quiet! - Are you crazy? - Watch. Watch for me! What are you doing? It's too risky. - Give me your Bible. - Why? Give me your goddamn Bible! Watch. It's all right! Jesus, we're right there. There's the pipeline, right there. - Hurry up. - I can't believe we're so close. They're coming back. - Peter. - Oh, shit. Okay. - You're crazy for risking our lives. - Okay, almost. Almost. - Goddamn fool! - All right, I've gotta bring it back. I'll take it back. No, it's too dangerous. I'll do it. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Muy, muy lucky. These pigs are lucky to have you. Muy, muy lucky. That's your main account. The others are subsidiary. - Sign all of these? - And initial each page. You have to keep each account under $200,000. Anything over that, they put a magnifying glass on it. Once the accounts are available, it takes under an hour... for the funds to be transferred from your bank in Denver. Dino, that third drawer down at the bottom, there's candles. Maria, can you grab me some candleholders? - Third time this week. - Sorry. Don't apologize, one has to live with these guerrillas. Torch it up. There. Careful. - Initial the passport numbers. - The host with the most. Just like your last birthday party. What happened at your last party? Terry popped out of a cake. Scared the shit out of us. It's a K and R thing. You gotta get me a pair of boots. I'll never make it out in these. - You won't make it without me. - No! I'm not gonna be responsible for you. This is my decision. For me. Once I start, I'm not gonna turn back. You're not responsible. Eric, I have to get back to my wife. I have to. If I stay here, I'll die. I know it. This is not your problem. I'm coming with you. I can't stay here alone. Not now. I'd go crazy. Marco, it's Tio. Acknowledge? Marco, it's Tio. Do you copy? Over. Is this unusual? What is this? A ploy? What is he doing? He said he'd be on the radio on Sunday. He's taking the figure back. - That's a deal. - Where is he? If you can hear me... but I can't hear you... we need some other way to communicate. Do you copy? Tio calling Marco. Marco, do you copy? We're getting a little anxious to know whether this deal is 100 percent. Ask if Peter's all right, can you? We need some kind of indication that Peter Bowman is okay. Which way? The river's got to be this way! You gotta get up! We gotta keep moving! - Come on! - No, you got to get out of here! Take this! Get the map out of here! It's your only chance. - Promise me you'll keep going. - I promise. Shit! Where's your pigs? Marco, this is Tio. Do you copy? G'day. You better get out of there. - What's up? - The German. Kessler. That missionary fella? He's out. Some farmer dumped him at one of my precincts last night. What's that got to do with me? He says he was with Peter. He says they made a run for it. It doesn't sound good, Terry. For the meals, we could eat together. But the food is nothing. It's just to keep you alive. But Peter would transform this crap into a feast. He would say... Tonight, let's see what Alice has made for us. Alice... you were everything for him. He talked about you and your daughter, Mali... all the time. He loved you both so very much. You have to know... I'm so sorry. He didn't see him killed or see a body. He heard a shot. You gotta wake up. You gotta get real on this now. You don't spend that much time on a deal and kill your hostage. When did you last have contact? A week? Two weeks? I've just had nothing but 22 days of static. Maybe there are no more deals. Maybe this is coming apart. Maybe he's alive, mate. Maybe he is. Maybe he is. But what we do know is that my guy's still there. They don't know Kessler's out. They think he's dead. Kessler knows every inch of that camp, and he's willing to help me. - He's a missionary... - He's not! He is from the French Foreign Legion. So what? He found God. He's got a map in there. A map that I think is real. Where are you going with this? Okay. This has to stay quiet. And she has to know that. You're thinking of going in, are you? Is that it? Fuck thinking. That's what I'm doing. I'm in there on the phone. That's all I do. Tell me what else to do. Talk to me before you do anything, okay? For you, I can do that. For you. You don't keep me up to speed, I'll take it personally. You've been doing that a lot lately. - I can't hear any more! - Wait! An eyewitness saw him killed. Until we're sure, this has to stay in play. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? He didn't see a body. Peter is dead! Let me grieve! - Why can't you do that? - Instinct. Until I know, until I'm sure... until I've received a visual confirmation of Peter's body... I'll retrieve my cargo and complete my mission. She's just a girl. She's too young to be involved in this. It's very dangerous for her. How you doing? I haven't heard from you in two weeks. I miss you. Why don't you call me Tio? And I'll call you Marco. You've got a good game going here. Your wife thinks you're with the pals. They think you're with a mistress. And there you are, every Wednesday night... bartering human life. This is a tape of my friend Marco. It's not the only one. Is Peter Bowman alive? Is Peter Bowman alive? He tried to escape. He was hurt. Yeah. He's alive. Is he with the Italian, Calitri? How did you find me? Now, I have $600,000 waiting. I've got another 50 off the books... between you and me, if we get this done. Or I've got this tape. I lay it on your buddies and you don't make it out of the car park alive. Let's just get this deal done, shall we? It's not the money. That doesn't matter anymore. It's always the money, Fred. You have a billion dollars? Because that's the money we are talking about. Octonal won't buy this pipeline without a promise from the army... to completely destroy us! That pipeline goes right through our coca fields! They are buying a war. Peter Bowman will never get down. He knows too much. We are fighting for our life. Listen to me. There are no more deals. Enjoy the parade, Fred. This is the camp. He said they call it Canyon Verde. This is the river. This valley, the big one below, it's very active. Every time the army comes, there's a skirmish. Here's March, May and June. Kessler said that every few weeks, the whole camp runs out and fights. - Pipeline? - Fifteen klicks downriver. - Hey. - Hey, Tomas! Terry Thorne. Tomas Morales. These guys are top. They're my Panama crew. I trained them myself. So, simply, all we have to do... is encourage the army to cross the river. Right about here would be convenient. Start a battle, join the camp. Drop in on this flat area here. While they fight, we slip in from behind, extract cargo and exit. So we call the army, schedule a battle. How's Wednesday around 3 for you? We don't call them, mate. Alice is gonna do it for us. Can you get a bird? Crew plus seven? Are you in love with this woman? I don't know what you're holding out hope for. You save the day, she sees the light and runs off with you? It doesn't work that way. You know that. I want to cash out of here. I want my own shop. If we could pull this off... It's the stuff of legends. We could sell this. Don't get me wrong. I'd love to go out of here a winner. But I have been over and over this a thousand times, and it's fucked! So we're on, then? Absolutely. You'll have to lie, Alice. You've gotta totally bullshit this bastard. We gotta get the army to invade ELT territory tomorrow. Peter's life depends on it. You have to... walk right up to Fellner and flat out lie. And he's got to buy it, or we run out of options. I got you! Alice! Are you... You okay? ELT wants a million dollars for Peter. We don't have it. Well, that's a lot of money. If I told you how to protect the pipeline... would Octonal step up and do the right thing? What kind of information? Alice! Alonzo, don't go away. I'll be right back. Alice, come on. You think I don't wake up every morning and think about Peter? I have had a dozen meetings with the transition team about this situation. - Just how wrong I think it is. - Fuck you, Ted. Look, Alice. I'm... I'm not sure what we're talking about here. But you give me something to work with... and maybe I can push this the last mile. ELT is going after the pipeline tomorrow. I know where. Do you step up for Peter or not? I don't know what you think you're accomplishing... or what you think you know, or how stupid you think I am... but I get three military briefings a week. It's a good bet that if anyone knew what was happening, it would be me. Is that a no? How could you possibly know this? Who the hell is that? I am Kessler. Eric Kessler. Two phosphorous, two smoke, two HE... two flashbangs per mag. G-36. But it's a British kick. - One day's rations. - One day? I've just come from a sit-down with our friend Dover McLoon... at the embassy, who's freaked out over a rebel push towards Rio Verde. Nice going, Alice. Ready to rock, Terry. Kit inspection, 15 minutes, on the bird in an hour. You heard him. Let's go! Let's go! We've got to move right now. Don't make me wait, caballeros! We got to prep that LZ right now! I've never seen you nervous. Yes, you have. I make it 90 to 100. And that ain't no overnight stay. Kessler's map is perfect. Peter's the engineer. I'm impressed. Fellner does have clout. In less than 24 hours... the army has crossed the river. How silly. Well, me old mate... why don't you wander uptown? I'll catch you on the flip side. Downtown 3 is in position. - Copy, Downtown 3. - Downtown 1... Stand by. This is Uptown 1. We've taken position above the farmhouse, over. Uptown 1, this is Downtown 1. Visual on the wood shack. Breakfast in bed for one. Appears principal cargo is on board. Roger that. Downtown 1, this is Uptown 1. We have breakfast for three. Delivery in progress. All call signs, final head count. Wood shack, one player. Red bandanna. POR door, 6:00. Barracks, 3:00, five players. Over. Uptown 1, two-man detail on the farm with possible cargo inside... and we have a player returning downtown via the upper path. Downtown 1, this is Downtown 3. Parade ground, 15. Copy. That gives us... 21 visuals downtown, two uptown, and one in transit. - 24 confirmed. - Copy. Uptown 1 is good to go. Standing by... Downtown. Peter Bowman. Alice sent me. Alice, your wife, sent me. She told me about Mali. How she died... in Africa. My daughter? Mali. Mali. Alice told me. Your wife. So you would know. I'm here to get you home, okay? All right? You're not fucking with me? No, mate. I'm for real. We're gonna get out of here. All right? Okay. Downtown 2, you've got a player at 5:00. What fucking player? Softly, mate. Softly. Downtown 1, what was that? All call signs, wait out. - I repeat, what the fuck was that? - Downtown 2! - Downtown 2, respond. - This is Downtown 2. Not in position. I've got a 25th confirmed. Downtown 3, 12:00. Downtown 1, I got him. What are we doing here? Stand by. What are we doing here? Fuck. Downtown 1, what are we doing? Go loud. - Fuck. - Roger that. He's down! Know how to use a gun? You missed! Cover me! Safety is on. Get down. - Ready? Let's go. - I'm with you. Back! Got one at the farmhouse. Shifting position. Downtown 3! Pressure at 9:00, on my count! One! Two! Three! Peter, let's go! Stay low. Fuck! - Peter! - I'm ready. Up, up, up! Through there! Clear! Stay down! Stay down! Stay down, motherfucker! Signor Calitri? - Which way? - Come on! This is Uptown 1. We are secure. I got the cargo. We've got bogeys up our ass. Bring the Big Bird to LZ-3. Copy, Downtown 1. Move to LZ-3. We are blue option 3. Big Bird, Uptown 1. Request exfil. We are option 3. We are good to go. Proceed to LZ-3. I repeat, LZ-3. Safety's off, okay? Keep moving. What are you doing? Keep going down the path! Follow the path! Peter, look at me. Look at me! Keep going. I know you're in pain, but keep going. If they catch you, they'll kill you. Stay on this path. It leads to Alice. It leads home! Stay in front of me. Go! Terry, what's going on down there? The Big Bird is en route. I got it. It's okay. Get the camisa up! Terry, where are you? Terry! Downtown 1 is traveling well. Got a visual on the bird. We're coming in. Oh, you big, beautiful bitch! There she is! Want to go home? We're gonna get you home, baby! Uptown 1, this is Downtown 2. I have a man down! Downtown 3 is down! - Say again? - I repeat, Downtown 3 is down. Fuck! Give me that fucking thing! Go! Five! Downtown 2, I'm on my way. Downtown 1... this is Uptown 1. Downtown 3 is down. I'm going back to get him. Uptown 2 has my cargo on the bird. We'll evacuate back to the LZ. I repeat, be evacuating back to LZ-3! Roger that. I'm at the LZ. Got an eye on the bird, my cargo's intact. My back door is clear. You need help, give a yell. Look out, grenade! Juaco! Peter! Yeah! - I can't see! - I'm right here. I got you. Just hang on to me. Are you crazy? Get on that chopper, now! - Let's go! - Wait! Eyewash! Get him some eyewash! He needs something for his eyes! He needs it now! He's alive! It's right here! Carlos, look at me! Who am I? - You're an asshole. - That's right! Are you all right? Don't you fucking die on me, man! I knew you... He always does this shit! You're a pussy! He's a fucking pussy, man! How is it? Who are you? Terry Thorne. How's my wife? She okay? She misses you. She's waiting where we land. Welcome home! Keep your head down. Hello, Alice. You all right? Hey, what did I tell you? Sandro! Hi. You look great. I need one minute. Okay. - We did it. - You did it. You better get going. We could be very unpopular in the near future. I thought we'd... Sit around and chat, the three of us? There's a 6:00 flight to Dallas you can make. There's a passport in the Jeep for Peter. Norma will pack and send everything. His leg looks bad, but it can wait till Dallas. This is important. No telephone calls, no high-fives, no champagne. You get to the airport and you make that plane. Just tell me you know how much you mean to me. So we're even. No, we'll never be even. I've given you nothing. Believe me, we're even. You deserve more than this. You got a plane to catch. I'll see you around, Mrs. Bowman. Get my Ellington records and my scotch. The good shit. 12-year-old, not crap. Remember the encrypted phone. Take care, Alice. Who's the man? Stuff of legends. You are the man. Sandro, we've got to get to the airport fast. We've got a flight in an hour. We made it. Yeah. Let's go home. We open our own shop. I run New York, you run London. We meet in the Caymans once a month to visit our money. Strictly white glove. Lots of long lunches. No more front lines. Some consulting, some policies... and we give Ian a heart attack before we open the doors. I don't know if I want you visiting my money.
