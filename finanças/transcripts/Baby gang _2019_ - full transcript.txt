The main characters of this movie are street boys who acted without script, basing only on the instructions of the director. A dramatically present representation connected to the neo-realism of Pasolini. The movie refers to recent news item and to a constant growing phenomenon in our country: The baby gangs. Any reference to specific facts or persons really existing is purely accidental. Invesges Film present A Stefano Calvagna movie What does it happen Giorgio? Eh what happens Doc? This isolation matter... I can't stand it anymore. They took off my laces... the blankets, the pillows, the television....what can I do?

Once he entirely stole the cashier of a rest stop using a pack of cigarette as a hoax. What a kind guy! It's Giorgetto, you know, the grandson of Pasquale the mechanic. The grandson? Wasn't he his son? He's not the son, he's the grandson. His father has been dead for a long time, he was killed near his home. He's like a father, he raised him. Yeah, I don't give a damn! The important is that he's not a son of a bitch like his uncle because he sent us the check of the cut cars, this piece of shit you see! By the way, mention him the affair then I'll go there and explain him everything. Yes ì, but I don't think it's a problem. Giorgetto is always without money so when it's related to it he could do anything. He also has that habit? Everybody has some habits. Well, don't be an asshole! Finish this bumper, I can't stand that man anymore! Drago, do you have a piece of stuff? You still have to give me the money of last time I'll give it in one go.

Don't you really think of anynone? Giacomino. I'm fed up with him! We have to beat him. He's not at the small playing fields anymore, but I know where he lives. Let's beat this villain. What the fuck he wants? Who's he? - The Fibia. Mà, do you know the relationships he has with my father? I know, but he has something interesting to tell us about money. Marchè, did you talk with these guys? ì, I really forgot it. I made it safe. Do you want to earn some money? Are you Santa Claus? So I took a nice walk. ì, wait a moment. Gò, be serious. This is a skimmer. Is it a game? Yes, to watch porn sites. It's used to clone credit cards. You insert the card, it takes the datas and you enjoy the money, it's very easy. I've got a friend who sucks my dick without taking datas. Don't be an asshole! I told you to let him talk. Listen to Marco. You work at a restaurant, how many cards can you do per month? One hundred 20% for one hundred cards 20% is not that much, let's do 30%. You got a lawyer 20%, take or leave it. Ok, let's do it. This is very expensive. May I snort on it, is it? You can do the fuck you want, you only have to bring me 100 cards. No sooner said than done. As about the affair of your father, he has a fuck nothing to do with it, understand? Who the fuck do you think I am? Don't take drugs. Did you see? The bill please, waiter. I'll bring it. -Thank you. Try to be more polite with customers. Thank you.

Everybody tells me. What about you? Everything's all right. Go away, I Keep this one. Thank you, goodbye. Don't run! Put on the seat belt. Yes, goodbye. Good evening. Good evening. Take this one. How many cards are in? -20 What do you mean 20? We said 100 I see, but I work in a restaurant. Were these people wealthy, do they have money? They looked like rich. -That's better. Marco will bring you this. Never come to the workshop, rather don't set foot there even if you visit your father, understood? Wait, wait, how do I know how much money is in? Who will tell you? You have to trust in me. What about the promised advance payment? I was about to forget it. It's 2000 euro, it should be enough. Are you fucking kidding me? I'll buy a Rolex with this money.

Be quiet, we won't beat you. Piece of shit! Piece of shit! Hi Drago. Do you have a piece of stuff for me, your friend? It's always ready for you. What about the others? They're making mess around. "The leopard cannot change his spots." What would the life be without it? If somebody would pay Chiarè. Did you meet Giacomino anymore? I wish I could have seen him. Two weeks ago he said "I'll pay you, I'll pay you" then he disappeared and I feel a sort of strange matter. What do you mean? He has to pay 200 euros to Giorgetto as well. Ah! What a good habit he started. Maybe is he blowing the whistle? I started thinking of it too. Be careful. Yes, see you bye Drago. Hi Lucré, long time no see! Hi guys! How are you? Everything's all right. Who's this man? My boyfriend. He wanted to talk you about one thing. I thought he was your uncle. Oh my God! Do you give him a kidney for Christmas? How old is he? Mind your own fucking business! If you done with this theatre, we could talk about serious things. Who's Marco? Guess it! Am I a magician? So tell me. Do you want to make authentic money or you're satisfied with this small change? How much money are you talking about? 1000 euros every time. What's all about? She told me that you've underage and available friends. They all are 16 years old, what's more? They still have the num-num. We're interested in money. Money is not a problem, there's a lot of money. How do I know that you're not cheating me? I ensure you, than they pay you immediately, money cash. No violence and similar or a disaster could happen. Violence? They don't give a damn of violence, they just want to fuck and have money. How can we keep in touch? She will give me your phone numbers. The most important is that when I call you they have to be ready. We can do it. Let's keep update, right guys! Lucré, your boyfriend looks like a decent person, is it? Think of you! Can we trust your friends? Yes, don't worry, they're not villain, I used to going out with them in the past. Why don't you hang out anymore? Because I'm always with you. You're right, I didn't think about it. To change this light bulb you should need an investigator, fuck you! Boss, Giorgetto send you this. Ah! What does he want to do? We said 100 credit cards per month. The other day there were 20 which I don't do a fuck! What the fuck you want from me? I don't work with him. Don't you work with him? Tell him that he needs to wise up, understood? I can tell him, but he explained me that he had troubles at his workplace I don't give a damn, I don't work for the trade union! These things cost me a lot every month and I have to justify to other people. I've got 4 of them. 3 gave me 100, 120, 150 credit cards, he brought me 20 so what do I do with 20, do I clean my ass with it? Go and tell him! Fuck to the light bulb as well! What the fuck!

Piece of shit, I'd make a hole in your forehead just because you fuck an underage. And you, go home! What the fuck are you doing, guys? You're weirding my boyfriend out. Your boyfriend is a piece of shit. What do you mean? I mean, he promised in front of you that he'd have given to girls 1000 euro each time. Do you know how much he gives them? 100, 150 euros I see, but you're robbing all his customers. Of course, we're taking what belongs to us. Take care, my boyfriend is dangerous. Fuck dangerous, he jerks us off! Listen, when will you meet him again? Tomorrow night. -Where? At the 'Grani di sale' restaurant. All right. Consider that this stuff is more respectable than he is, it's just a suggestion. What's the matter? Are you nervous? Do you think I'm nervous? Did you talk with your friends? Yes, I talked with Giorgetto, the one I'm much more in confidence. What did he say? He said that you promised 1000 euro whereas you give them 100, 150 euros. They're robbering all my customers, they're making a complete ass of myself. They don't know I'll kill each of them I know, but you promised them 1000 euros that's why they act this way. What should they do with money? They can live with 150 euros, these pieces of shit. So is this the truth? Whose fuck side are you on? Low the voice, everybody hears us! I don't give a damn if they listen to me! Who are you calling now? Who are you fucking calling? Mind your own fucking business! Go away before I slap you, go away! Mind your own fucking business, worry about the dishes! Here he is! Let's go! Piece of shit! I'll kill you, fuck you, I'll kill you! We're calling the ambulance, keep calm! Guys, did you shoot in Andrea's legs? Who the fuck is Andrea? Your boyfriend, that piece of shit? He's not my boyfriend anymore, he's an asshole. Did you shoot or not? Lucré, why all these fucking questions? Are you a guard? It's just to understand. What do you want? Why did you come here? I spent a period of shit, I want to go out with you. By force it was, with that big belly. Tell me, how could you fuck that pee bag? He was kind at the beginning, we often went out for dinner, he gave me gifts. Now we'll give you gifts, did you notice the kind of life of your friends? I saw them, everybody has haute couture bags, the new phone. Do you also want that kind of life or not? I wish! It's very easy, you do the same as with that piece of shit. Nevertheless this people will pay you, 1000 euro each time I think I can't. What the fuck do you say? You had no problem with that slimy. Yes, but it was different. Let's do in this way. You go out with these people and before they touch you. Giorgetto and I will come and rob them of everything. Maybe I can do it if we do so I'll let you meet with Chiara so she can give you some contacts. All right. Bye Lucré. Chiaré, Marco told me you'll give me the contacts. Of course, I'll send you them to WhatsApp. Finally you decided to join us. Yes, I want to stay with you, I want to enjoy with you. It's easy. The most important is to have the money in advance and text the location to Giorgetto. Since he has to know where you are, at what time and with whom you're there. All right, before starting I text him the location. They told me no one won't even touch me with a finger. Lucky you! Now I'm used to it whereas you do nothing and earn money I saw, news bags, new phone. I also have other stuff, once I'll show you. Why were you gone for so long? He was so ugly, too. I don't know Chià, I liked him. He took care of me. Then he started being an asshole, he also beat me. What a piece of shit! Why didn't you call me? If I'd have told to others do you know what would they do to him? I didn't want to make a mess, I liked him so much. Now you're with us, don't worry. Everything's all right. How old are you? Sixteen. This is the first time for me. A friend of mine involved me, I never did something like this. Don't worry, they are my friends, trusted people. Do you only do this? Are you a guard by chance? Do your parents know of this affair? -Mind your own fucking business! I'm afraid that you blurt everything out I've a family, two sons I'm not a villain. I can't waste my time. Did you take the money? Yes, 200 euros. You're wrong, it's 1000 euros. They told me 200 euros. It's 1000, how much you've got? Maybe 500 euros. Give me 500 euros and everything you have. Richard Gere! Do you want to act like in "Pretty woman"? Hurry up, give us the money and don't make me repeat it! Come on piece of shit! We dont' have time to waste! You're fucking with a little girl, fuck you, she could be your daughter. I didn't do anything. So good idiot, you go back home with full nuts! Asshole, give me the watch as well before I shoot in your face! Hurry up! You go home, hurry up! Giorgé, come here! What are you doing? What the fuck did it happen? Miss Anna and the head chief didn't notice, but I guess you're doing something with the cards. Cracco, mind your own fucking business! These are my fucking business because I won't work anymore if this place should close down. Nobody will close if you shut up whereas I'll make you shoot in the legs if you blab. Go away! As in the golden days. More slowly, sveglio! Let's go guys! Do you have the feet shot? Wake up! We have to win this tournament! I didn't pay 15 euros of subscription for fun. If I smoke another joint I collapse on the field, I've got years of experience with drug not the ones of soccer school. - Fuck you! - What the fuck! Shit! Piece of shit! Asshole! Is it closed? Fuck them, then they say I'm on delay. Madame, I'm at the restaurant but it's closed. Madame? Hallo! Did she hang up? Are you Giorgio Sacchi? Yes, I am what did I do? You have to come with us. Keep calm, you've to come with us. What did I do? If it's about past affairs I've got some complaints but nothing special. So why did you text me? Shouldn't we meet tomorrow morning? I sent it on to you and to those pieces of shit of Giulio and Luca, but fuck they didn't answer. What do you mean they didn't answer? I mean they didn't give a shit about me. Did you hear them? Where the fuck are they? Luca had some troubles with the family whereas Giulio. Giulio had problems with toilet. Just now that we should be closer since they caught Giorgetto and we've to find a solution. To get some money to pay a respectable lawyer there are only the two of us, is it correct? No, but I think they shit their pants. Of course they did once they saw ugly moments. I also went to his uncle, at the workshop, if he knew or told me something more, but fuck nothing. This asshole also got upset. As if it was me to let the son catch. You're detaining me since 4 hours, I don't know how to tell you that I've nothing to do with this affair Giorgio, we received some warnings that you've a skimmer to clone the credit cards. Tell me who gave you this skimmer and you'll be released. I'd tell you who gave it to me, but I don't know what the skimmer is. Maybe you mistook with the telephone, here it is. We received accurate warnings. Who could have given these warnings? That bitch who hang up the telephone today to let me catch or maybe that shit chef. Moderate the words because you're not talking with your friends at the bar, please I'm sorry. You're lucky since we don't have any evidence, but be careful, we keep an eye on you. May I go? Go away. Does your friend know anything? No, he's away from Rome for a drill. Fuck, he's very useful. Do you think is he in prison? It's possible, it's been 6 hours. I guessed you were here. Fuck you, I was worried. My mother too, she was about to call "Who has seen him?" Right bò. Listen why did they catch you? Is it due to the robbery? The robbery doesn't have a fuck to do with it, it's about this fuck skimmer, thanks godness I didn't have it. Give me a cigarette, I'm craving for it. -Take it! They kept there for 6 hours, only the lie machine was missing. Fuck them, they came from behind there, I was going to work and it was closed I called that woman, she hang up and when I turned around a female and a male appeared from the thicket. They leaded me to the police station, that woman continued asking "Tell me who gave it to you". "Tell me where this skimmer is" Fuck her! This fucking dick gave it to me! I had to act like Marlon Brando with them. Listen, where are the others? We were talking about them now. They disappeared since you were caught. You see how friends are. Let's go drinking, we have to celebrate. Don't give a damn, let's go! Do you treat, is it? Tell your friend to come. So what? I told to call him. What's the problem? The problem is that they are kids, they want everything soon. We told 1000 euros and he's bringing less then a half. He pretends the money in advance, that's no good. Don't bust our chops! Let's take him the skimmer away. No, let's teach him something and see what's happen. Do you see this hook? I stick you there and slaughter like a lamb, understood? What the fuck you want? Do you think to frighten me with your friends? I'm not afraid of fucking anything, let alone you. We've got Al Capone I don't want to frighten you. You have to bring me 1000 euros per month, this is the deal. How many did you bring me? I'm still waiting for the 200 euros of last month, is it? Listen who's talking! Although you got money and already spent them, is it true? What the fuck you want from me? I'm working in a fucking restaurant, they pay with pumpkin seeds not credit cards. I'm doing miracles! You should thank me. He did the miracle, you see? We've the magician from Naples. They also caught me, don't you consider it? They caught you because you gave wrong tips about the robberies to your idiot friends. Don't get my friends involved! You don't have to touch me! Piece of shit! Bastard! Oh! Fuck you! Lift him up. Let's go, we have to close. Get out of my way! Fuck you! What did these pieces of shit do? Fuck them! What did you do to my son, piece of shit? Get out of my way! -Move away dad! Stop! Pieces of shit! Give me this gun and get in the car. Stop, stop, stop come here, stop! Don't move, stop, don't move! Come on, get up! Spread your legs! What you've got here? I don't have a fucking dick! What you've got here? Take him away. I can't believe it, I can't be believe it! I'm getting mad, I'm getting mad! They told me they only had to talk with him, these pieces of shit! I let him go alone, holy shit! What an asshole! Now Giorgetto got into big troubles, you know? Of course, he killed three people. I know, but his uncle told me that they dealt him a bunch of blows, these pieces of shit! They deserved it. They deserved to be kneecapped, not to die. Here he's fuck Padre Pio! Do you think that one brings a gun, take aim and shoot to the legs. What the fuck do you say? They deserved it. Now we don't have to think of how it could go, let's find a solution but right now, today and not tomorrow. What kind of solution? Taking a bulldozer and break through Rebibbia's wall? Or snap your fingers so tomorrow he'll be out of jail? Which are your solutions? Are you getting smug Sandì? I'm not, I know how it works. Sit down. If you know how it works to get out a kid of jail, then you know that you need a true lawyer, a tough man. We have to find the best lawyer of Rome for Giorgio. To do so we need money, authentic money, not these small changes. We'll find the money. We increase the kids and do more robberies. I saw a jewerly in Ostiense with neither camera nor security door. This jewerly can be a good idea, but we have to wait a little bit. They just caught Giorgetto and will take just a few moments to think of us, these pieces of shit. We have to wait. There's something else, the most important thing. If these three pieces of shit, these puppets beat him, for sure there's a big wig who commissioned them to do it and you have to find him. Don't worry, a friend of mine is a guard but he supports us. I'll solve it. Thank you Sandì. Listen, bring me two joints, today I don't have them and it's already chapping my ass. What the fuck do you want? Keep calm, I just want to tell you that tonight I'll meet a client. You told me not to text you so here I am. At what time will you meet him? At the small park at 10 p.m. , I don't know where we'll go. All right, text me the location as soon as you'll stop but don't forget to delete the message. Yes, of course. What about Giorgetto? Giorgetto won't come tonight nor for a long time. Let me know about it because a friend of my father could do something. Is he like your boyfriend, a reliable person? He's a good lawyer. Arrange an appointment soonest before these pieces of shit entrust a public defender. What the fuck we do with that? Will you come alone tonight? No, the guards will come with! Go away! Remember your promise that they won't touch me even with a finger. Don't bust my chops, I'm not stupid! Go away! This bitch! Lucré, was this a very good lawyer is it? He was sentenced to 27 years in the first instance, 27, fuck him! I talked with him last day and he told me they'd have sentenced the minimum penalty. I'm one of the best lawyers in Rome. Yes, the best one to tell bullshits, this asshole! He gave me the phone number of the prison psychiatrist. I already arranged an appointment, but you need to go there. Don't bust my chops, it's already chapping my ass! You have to go there! Yes, yes you have to go and that's all! If ever he asks you'll do oral sex too. All right. Lucré, don't do bullshits, I give you the phone numer, you arrange an appointment and go. Don't bust my chops, bye! Lucrezia, what can I do for you? Doc, do you address to me formally? I'm only 16 years old. What's your name? Paolo. Tell me what can I do for you. For Giorgetto. Giorgetto has a heavy sentence. He was sentenced to 27 years in the first instance. He was hurt by it. I tried to cheer him up, but it's difficult. Now we have to see what happens. The lawyer told me that he'll try to reduce the sentence on appeal. Maybe at the Court of Cassation and after a good behaviour. Perhaps he could serve a term of imprisonment of 10, 12 years 12 years? Giorgetto couldn't stand it. There must be another way. The only way is the prison incompatibility, but it's impossible since Giorgio is fine. He's able to understand and take action I've got very rich friends, they could give lot's of money. To do what? We should produce a false medical certificate. Will he get out of jail if you produce this certificate? Sure, but I'll get into prison. I don't want to face problems so there's no money to keep. Please, you have to do something. It's too risky Lucrezia, I can't do it. Only you can help me. I'd do it, but it's not possible. What are you doing Lucrezia? You're so beautiful, I get out the entourage and go out with you. No, we can't do it. Will you produce this certificate? I'll try to produce it tomorrow. Don't try, but do it! Ok. You're are really pretty, how old are you? I'm 16 years old. Take off your clothes. First give me the money 1000 euros? This is what they told me to give you and that's it. Let me count them. I'm cold, turn on the hot air. No problem, I'll warm you up. Just a moment, I text to mum. What's the matter? Relax, you're shaken. Piece of shit, give me all the money or I'd shoot in the face! Come on! Also this bracelet, hurry up! The watch! Leave it to me, it's a gift from my mother I don't give a damn of your mother! Hurry to give me that watch before I kill you, asshole! Nooooo! Marco, Marco, Marco! Help! Marco! Marco, Marco! Help! Yesterday night Marco Fiacchini of 17 years old was killed during a robbery attempt. The thug with many criminal records was hit to the back with a weapon by a well-known Roman business owner. Now the live traffic news with Gianfranco Tortora. Good morning! Welcome to the traffic forecasts. We'll go together to catch them. I like you like that, bò. By the way, guys, I'm fed up of these football games. We are good at fighting, but we're disgusting when we play football. Be quiet bò, after this match they'll for sure give us the banner order. What do the fuck we care, guys? Look at Marco's car. We're earning authentic money and you still think of playing football. Do you like this car, bò? I gave him 30.000 euros. It drinks as my granpa with wine, fuck it! I had to buy something inevitably. Right guys, yesterday I saw a secondhand Rolex with a blue clock face, it costs 5000 euros, I've to buy it necessarily. You see how it works? Really good. You're right Sandì, everybody has to do something on a whim. But be careful, they don't have to notice us or we'll get into troubles, you know. Let's talk of something serious. Shall we go and eat a good pizza or a sandwich? What's a sandwich? I'd like oral sex in this way right now. What are you saying? These are really holy words. I want to spend all the money on whores. We take the best whore of Rome, all the 5 of us will fuck her together so to feel our dick! Will she be fucked from the 5 of us? We also could beat her with all the money we have. Whereas I'd bring the best stuff of Rome. This was unexpected. Now shut up guys, the master starts singing. English Subtitles by Daniela De Sanctis
