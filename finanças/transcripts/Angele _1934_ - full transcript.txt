Make some coffee, Angèle? Yes, Father. There. Give Saturnin some, too. Why were you arguing with Felix? He brought his sow for the boar. Fourth time. I've had enough. Doesn't he pay? No, he won't. He did the first time, then yesterday he says, "It's no good. Try again." "Says who?" "I know." "How do you know? You're not in her skin!" But he insisted, I said yes, he left her two more days. And this morning, there he was again. So I said, "Maybe your sow is randy and comes here for pleasure." "She'll tire my boar out." "Your sow's a dirty beast and I don't want her killing my boar." He says, "He's useless." He said that? He won't find another one like it. I says, "My boar's a good beast. Top class. Strong and all." He says, "He's got no strength." I says, "You're a liar." He says, "You grew up in care." And that's true, I did. Master Clarius raised me and I'll hear no ill of the family. Calm down, Saturnin. Drink your coffee. He says, "Your boar's no man." "I know he's not," I says. He had turned his back: a boot up the backside. Whose? Felix's? No, the sow's! So he chased me to hit me and I went in with the boar. And so he left. You did well. And if he doesn't like our boar, he can take care of his sow himself. Where to, Angèle? Just over to get the chickens, and then I'll do some shopping. - Got the list? - Yes, Mother. What are you adding? Your tobacco, Father. Good girl. One packet or two? Two packets. You smoke too much. Do I smoke too much, Saturnin? No. Why say no, when you know I do? I don't know, Master. So you don't mind lying? As far as I'm concerned, the truth is what you want to hear. Cretin! Philomène, give him some more coffee. I'll go to the field with the cart. See you later. Angèle! Off you go. Bye, my girl. Goodbye, Father. Home before night. Yes, Father. Young lady! Young lady! What is it? Young lady, I ran here to tell you a secret. Another one? What is it? Here's the thing. Someone came to see me. From La Badoque. The son. - Elzéar? - Yes, Elzéar. So, he comes to see me and says, "Saturnin!" And I says, "Yep?" And he says... "Saturnin!" I says, "Yep?" - And he says... - "Saturnin!" No. He says, "Saturnin, I'm unhappy." I says, "Tough luck." So he says, "Don't you care?" I says, "Nope, I don't." "You're unhappy but I'm happy, so I don't care." That's not nice. Then he says, "Want to know why I'm unhappy?" I says no. So he says, "Well, I'll tell you anyway." So I says, "Well, tell me then." And he says, "Here it is. I love Angèle. I love her", "and I want to marry her." So I says, "Marry her, then." Then he says, "Saturnin", "I must ask her father," "but before I do, I must know if she wants to." So I says, "Know what?" "You're not wrong!" So he says, "I'm counting on you" "to ask her that." So I'm asking you. There. Elzéar's very nice! Yes, he is. He's rich... He has a few fields, a good farm, true, but it's only a farm. What else? Yes, a farm is a farm. It's a farm. And? I was born on a farm! But you won't spend your life there. You're a princess. You don't want a peasant. What do I want? What you need is someone who wears a shirt and tie every day. With shoes cut there, you know. A gentleman from town. I never see any. Come to Aubagne with me when I go for the month's shopping. Then you'll see some. There's the haberdasher's son... The tobacconist's son, he's about 25. Lots of hair on his hands. With teeth as big as this. He's great! We can talk about that another time. Elzéar, I say no? I didn't tell you to say that. What do you want me to say? I'll say no. Say whatever you like. I'm happy as I am. I'm going to town. See you tonight. See you tonight, Saturnin! See that kid? I need a doll like that. You've got a cheek. What for? You don't earn enough to feed her. Oh, poor santon. I don't want her for that. She'd be feeding me. He's a young'un. That work is a pig. Tractors stink. They're too noisy. It's not for me. It's no life. Only an idiot could get used to it. It's good for you, but I'm from Marseille. What I need, see, is that kind of female. That, mate, is gold. 500 francs to dress her up, nice underwear, a covered walk at the Alcazar and to work! From one day to the next you'd have 300 francs, all told. Girl! - Where's your bicycle? - Behind the spindle-trees. I'm borrowing it till this evening. Friends, I'm off for a ride. Where's he off to? To hunt females! I reckon it's the first time that man has ever worked. He must've done something nasty and had to get away for a bit. Maybe because of the police. Possible. Yes, he's spineless. Hollow as a bad radish, can't hold a pickaxe, and always putting the blame on God. And then he gives himself kiss curls by wetting his hair in the fountain. And wears perfume like a cheap woman. He's a pig, that's all. Excuse me, Miss, can you tell me where this path leads? Meyrat is straight on. Is it far? No. 12 kilometres. In the valley behind the hill. Are you going there? No, I'm not. Where, then? Home. - Is that far? - No, not at all. In the countryside? Yes. Get along! Why are you scared of me? You can't scare me when I've a whip in my hand. What do you want? Just to chat for five minutes. Nothing bad. Not bad, but pointless. Pointless for you, maybe, but important for me. I know you. I know you well, I've seen you often. - Me? - Yes. Where have you seen me? I've never seen you before, anyway. I didn't show myself. Sometimes you just look from afar. Why? Stop a minute and I'll tell you. No, I don't know you! Go on your way. That's my father's house, there. Off you go! The horse bites. He's got no teeth left! Listen, Miss. No, I won't. Go away. I don't know you. Careful, if I call my father... What? He won't eat me. Maybe you don't want him to see us. Now listen. Tonight I'll be behind your farm and I'll whistle like this... And you can come out. If you come and whistle, I'll let the dogs out! Really? If you do that I know what to do. Let go of the reins! And if I won't? I'll strike! Bitch! I'll come to your house this evening, hear me? If you don't come out I'll set fire to it! Not bad, eh? Good evening. Where's that pig off to now? Reckon he's gone to see the girl with the cart. He doesn't know her. Maybe he's got to know her. Where? That's a shame. She looks like a nice, clean girl. Kind. Whereas he... Do you think a girl like her would listen to a man like him? With women, you never know. Is there much milk? Half a litre. Not much. She needs to be taken to see the billy. Who's whistling? It must be the shepherd. He went past. Where's Father? He went to fetch some wood. I'll go and meet him. Go on then, he likes that. Nice of you to come. Don't thank me. I came to tell you not to stay. My father will soon be home. What could he say? I'm only talking to you. - There's no law. - Yes there is. You shouldn't come in secret! You shouldn't whip people! I'm sorry if I hurt you. Maybe you're a good lad. But you tried to stop the horse. I wanted to tell you my secret. I was lost. Why? I can't say. And here... there won't be time. You're right. And it's none of my business anyway. Go away, please, and don't come back. - Don't you want me to? - No. Very well. I won't come again. I must leave tomorrow, leave the area for good. So I would have liked a little chat. But since you don't want to, I'll just go. Goodbye, Miss. Goodbye. I say "Miss" because I don't know your name. It isn't pretty. Marguerite? No. - Lucienne? - No. Marie? No, I know. Josephine. No. Angèle. And you say that's not pretty? Angèle's a nice name, you know. You're used to it, but I think it's wonderful. Angèle. I'm called Louis. Like my cousin! Do you like it? All men's names sound the same. Goodbye, Mr Louis, and no more trouble. Trouble, me? You'd like to be. Goodbye, now! Well, goodbye. Is it forever? My father! God help me if he sees us! Come on. Get down! Are they very strict? No, not strict. But they wouldn't like me talking to a stranger. That's how countryfolk are. But I'm a townie. - It shows! - How? Your cheek! Well, I haven't spent my life in some hole. You're lucky. Listen, Miss Angèle, you don't want me to stay and I'll obey. But one favour before I go: a little present. Let me kiss you. What for? Because I'm off. Angèle. Why kiss me like that? I love you. Why? I'll tell you. No! Angèle! Yes! Leave me, Mr Louis. No. Let me tell you. Can you not slip out? Impossible. Where's your bedroom? Angèle! On the ground floor. But it's not right. Listen, Angèle, I'm leaving. You know that. Just an hour's talk. No. Half an hour? Listen, Angèle, I'll wait all night if I have to. Well... once they're asleep I'll come back, if I can. He'd deserve to be killed. Who? Louis. If he did what he said with that girl. Would you kill him? No, it's none of my business. But if someone loved her... You, for example. You fancy her, don't you? Tell the truth. No... Do I fancy her? No, I'm from the mountain. "Fancy her" doesn't mean anything. What does it mean? "I fancy her" means, I don't love her but... I'd like to do what people do when they're in love. Not us. We respect women. We love them or we don't. And that's right. Maybe you love her. No. You can't say that so soon. Loving, you see, that's something deeper. Takes longer. Pass your knife. How many blades has it got? Nine. Where's that straw from? The field, there. If my father had seen you! Sit down a minute. Here. Will the dog bark? The dog? He died last month. You're a naughty liar. You said you'd set him on me. I was afraid, I didn't know you. Fancy being scared of me! You can fight. I have strength, but I wasn't sure I'd know how to use it. That was my worry. Is your father asleep? Yes, and I can see his bedroom window from here. So I'd see the light go on. I can't stay long, anyway. Thanks for coming, even for a minute. So you're off? Yes, leaving tomorrow. Back to my real job. What's that? I'm a musician. Like your friend! Who was playing the harmonica at the café. No! He's a peasant. A real one. Not that peasants aren't fine. But he's not a musician. I play the violin in cafés. I'm not a great artist, but I get along. Why did you come to the country? For my health. You know, the air in cafés, wearing a dinner jacket and dicky. Evening clothes. Breathing in smoke. Bad for the lungs. Yes. Town air isn't good for the chest. A friend of mine from the village went to Aix to be a maid. She had to come back, she was coughing. My mother noticed it. One evening she said, "Louis, leave your job and go to the country." "But I'll be bored." Getting a job with a company clearing land was her idea. Those big ploughs. Yes, I've seen them. How did you learn so quickly? When you're educated... Yes. It does help in life. Did you like it here? At first I didn't. But now I don't regret it! Yes. Is your health better? That's not all. What else? You. I've met you. Me! So what? So I love you. You know that, because I kissed you. Kissing isn't serious. What am I to you? A country girl. A plaything. Quite the opposite. You're naturally beautiful like the hill flowers. When I see you, my heart thumps. It's tremendous, I don't know why. You've lovers here, I bet! No, I haven't. What, a girl like you? What are the boys thinking? There aren't many. And they're shy. They daren't speak to girls. And sometimes when they try they don't know how. Whereas town folk... often say nice things. Maybe they're not true, though. Me, do you mean? Yes. You may indeed fancy me but maybe you don't truly love me. Why not? You don't know me. So what? Love is like a major illness. It strikes you. A shiver, and you're down. Angèle, come here. No. This is wrong. If my mother saw me! Don't you think she's done this too? I suppose she must have, with my father. Angèle... I love you. No. Yes, I do. - Be quiet. Don't move. - Not that! I don't want to. Be quiet. Don't move. No! OK, kids, I'm off! Got my pay, and off I go. Shiny shoes, anyone? - Me! - Me! For Pepino! Who wants some trousers? The only ones with no patched seat! - Me! - Me! Here, take them. Who wants a cap? Latest Parisian fashion. - Me! - Me! No... This I'm giving to Mr Amédée. Mr Amédée says get stuffed. Fine. Since Mr Amédée has rudely turned down my present, I'll give it to whoever can catch it. There! Thank you! Who wants... Oh, no, that's too nice. I'll keep it for myself. Where are you going? Marseille. Is there work there? Yes. Good work. You're off this morning, aren't you? If you come with me, I'll show you something nice. We're smart where I'm from. Show me what? Come, and you'll see. Come on. Come on. What's to see? Just behind there. Something dirty? It's the opposite. I'll show you something pretty. Something lovely. Come on. It's here. Sit down and be quiet. Look. - Well? - Well, that's it. That's my bird. How come? I got her with smooth talk. Like the others. First words, then kisses, then the rest. She's all mine. No? Wait till her father leaves. The old man up there. The farm's just behind. She's called Angèle, and Barbaroux. That's how you got her? She must be used to it. Well no, actually. I thought so too. But I just went to it and, you'd never guess, she was all new. That gave me a thrill. She won't regret it. With me, she won't be unhappy! Will you have her do what you said? What else can she do? Not someone's maid! Tonight I'll wait behind the house and off we'll go. It is true, isn't it? I don't like questions. Yes, is yes. If you say no then I'm off right away. Don't be unkind, Louis darling. You're a man, you don't understand. I'm leaving everything. My family, my village... Stay, then, if it's that important! Get yourself a farmer husband and have 12 stupid kids. You know I do want to go, and I will. You can be sure of that. But I'll leave this evening at 9 o'clock, 9.30. You said you'd do anything for me. You said, "I'll do everything." Everything or nothing? You know I'll do anything, my love! Angèle! Don't be afraid. I'm here to save you. Please don't go. Louis is a bad man. No good comes from towns. - Hardship awaits you. - Who are you? A mountain peasant who loves you. Don't leave, Angèle. Think. I have. Let me past! Angèle, that man is bad. He doesn't love you. Doesn't know how. He's just a heartless lout. Angèle, think of your mother. Think of her crying. Think of God keeping you. Look at the stars in the sky, look at your farm. Don't throw it away. I'm saying this for you, not me. You're crying. You see, I won. You've understood. That's him. Thank you for what you said. But it's too late. Fancy a game of poker? If you like. Go on, then. The truth is, we shouldn't blame her. You're in the wrong. You didn't teach her. No moral support. If you'd taught her, she'd have been gold. - I don't think so. - Why not? That woman isn't made for that job. And that's not all. There are things you don't know. What? She goes to church. She went to have her son baptised. That's true. I gave her permission. That would be alright but she goes for pleasure, and often. And sometimes, when you're here innocently thinking she's off doing her job, her ladyship is praying at St Laurent's. Oh, well! Listen, Jo, it's good of you to give me advice but I forbid you to mock my wife. I've seen her coming out! She goes to Mass? It's worse than that. When I saw her she was coming out of Vespers. Well in that case she's in trouble. I'll open. - Two! - I'll follow. Me too. Why would they take him? Because children are a pain, especially in this job. The landlady looks after him. Yes, but you feed him. He says it's not right. Says you lose your shape. There's truth in that. Why not a wet nurse? Because he's all I have left. He's mine and I'm keeping him. If they want to take him... If they want to take him they'll take him. You don't know them yet. They support each other. They're capable of anything. Me too! Hey, Saturnin! Tonin! Where are you going? Shopping: bread, salt, candles and the newspaper. Everything's just fine. Doesn't look like it. Seems you've gone nuts. That doesn't mean anything. I always have been a bit. Some people are shining lights. Some shine like a lighthouse, others like a match. We each shine like we can. All you need is good will. Goodbye, Tonin. Wait! I've got something important to tell you. How is it at the farm? You say you'll tell me something, then you ask a question! Answer me, I meant no harm. Is all okay? It isn't, and you know it. Since the young lady left, nothing is fine. She left with a townie and hasn't written. We don't know why. But she will write. She's sure to write. But she'd do well to hurry up. Because otherwise the master... We all have our burdens to carry. Sparrows carry nothing, donkeys carry a lot and I carry even more. You get used to it. Goodbye, Tonin. Listen, Saturnin, I know where she is. - Who? - Angèle. - Angèle! - Yes. I've seen her. I've spoken to her. Tonin, you're so handsome. You have a lovely face! Quick, Tonin! Where is she? Marseille. I thought so. How come you saw her? I'll tell you. I went to Marseille last month for my 28 days' national service. - Understand? - Yes. One evening, in a little street in the old town, this young lady calls out to me. I go to talk to her - it's her. - Had she recognised you? - No. So why did she call you, then? I dunno. Well! She didn't recognise you but she called you in the street? Maybe she did recognise me. No doubt she recognised me. You know, she has very good eyesight. When she was six and we didn't have a clock, we'd say, "Angèle, look at the clock on the Manosque church tower" "and tell us where the small hand is." We couldn't even see the clock face but she could see the hands. Can you believe it? Yes, surely she'd recognised me. Surely. What did she say to you? We talked about this and that, in the street. Didn't she invite you in? She did, but I didn't go. Why? I'd have been late back to barracks. That's a shame. I'd love to know what her flat is like so I can imagine it. So she's married? Dunno. How was she dressed? Very smart. With a hat? Yes. A pretty little blue hat. Like a lady. That Angèle is a wonder, you know. She knew what she was doing when she left. Did she mention us? Yes, she said... not to tell you I'd seen her. Why not? That's what she said. That makes me sad, but on the other hand she mentioned us and so she's thinking of us. Is she well? Looked a bit thin to me. That'll be the town air. Smoke from the boats. Young people are so silly. She's ashamed of us, it's natural because we're only peasants and she's a true princess. Especially if she married a smart townie. Not talking about us to him, not wanting him to see us, that's natural. But why wouldn't she, one day, on her own, catch a train and come to spend a month with us on the farm? She needn't tell anyone. It would do her good and make us so happy. And just now we so badly need something to make us happy. Did you tell her? No, I didn't. Listen, Saturnin, you know I'm your friend. I've got some advice for you. Firstly, don't say anything to anybody. - Not even her mother? - No, nobody! As for you, one of these days you get dressed up and go to Marseille. Mrs Philomène wanted me to go there to buy seeds and tools. And go to the social security office to sign some papers. Papers for the town hall. For me. Understand? You don't believe me. I have to go anyway. Go on then, as soon as possible. I'll give you her address. Angèle's? Yes, Angèle's. But she hasn't invited me. Go anyway. She'll be glad to see you and you'll do her a big favour. Me? What kind of favour can I do her? Go, and you'll see. Her address. - Can you read? - No. Mireille, 12 rue de I'arbre, Marseille. Mireille? Why Mireille? That's what she's called now. Very well. Louis, you're not unkind... That'll do. Where are rich men's kids? In the country. Well, I want yours to be like a rich man's son. I'm responsible, unlike you. That'll do. The boy isn't mine, but why shouldn't I treat him well? I'll be off, then. Goodbye. Oh, sorry. If you'd be so kind, maybe you could tell me... If I can. Number nine... When you leave here, turn right. Right. Fine. How far? As far as the third road on the left. - Okay. - Then... Then, give me back the paper. I'll ask someone because if you explain what's next now, I won't remember the beginning, see? - Goodbye, and thanks. - Goodbye. Excuse me, is this number 9? Yes, handsome, this is it. You've come from Paris, I see. Paris? I've never been there. I don't believe that. Are you here for me? Do you ever stop talking? Maybe, sometimes. I'm not here for you. That's a shame. You're so handsome. God, you're nice. So are you. And clever, too. Oh, that look... Nobody's said that before. I'm here to see Angèle. Angèle? Nobody here with that name. Oh yes, she has another name here. It's on the paper. Mireille! - Do you know her? - You bet I do! I'm her servant. Well, her father's. Does he know she's here? No, he doesn't know. The sweep said I should come. So I came by courtesy, as one of his servants. How many's he got? At least... twelve. Roughly. Let's say six. - Even one! - Even one, yes. Where is she? On the right, first floor. No bad news, I hope? Bad news? No. I wouldn't tell her, anyway. Because, let me say, the other day... Hang on. A client. Excuse me. You have a business? Sorry. - What is it? - A visitor. Come in. Hello, Miss. It's me, Saturnin. Excuse me saying "Miss", I should say "lady", but old habits die hard. I brought you these flowers I picked at the farm with news from home. Saturnin! Yes, Saturnin. Still the same, sadly. Why are you here? Well, Miss, what do you think? I've come from home. Your old home. I was just passing by and a local tradeswoman said, "She's upstairs." So I thought, "I'll go and take her some news." Because you didn't give us your address. I don't want to know why, it's none of my business. And if I mustn't say I've seen you, then I won't. But I thought you'd be pleased to know how things are at home. So I came up to tell you. Father? He's well. He's like that. Well, like that. He's fine. And Mummy? Mummy Philomène is joyful. She sings all day long. She sings? Well, that is to say... Not very loud. She hums. But she's happy. Mind, Miss, when you left we weren't happy. But you took my advice, you chose a town gentleman. You're here, you're happy, I can see and I understand. We've accepted it, and everything is fine. The boar is well too. Saturnin... The boar is superb. He's active, he's wonderful. The mule, too. The mule's fine. Getting older, of course. But, well, me too. That's for sure. We have potatoes in the garden. Coming along nicely. We had some bulrushes in the field but it doesn't matter, the grass is nice and thick. All's well. It's wonderful. Magnificent. It's... What about you? Me, Saturnin? As you see, I'm here. It's pretty. So this is your bedroom. Yes. Is it a big flat? What flat? Where you live. I'm here, Saturnin. I live here. It's nice. It's not big, it's nice. What about your husband? At work, maybe? I haven't got one. No. You see, Saturnin, no husband. And I've a child. A child with no father? No father. Oh, goodness, that's news all right. Well I never. That's news. So who did it? Where is he? I don't know. Maybe far away. He was a Northern sailor. Didn't even speak French. I think he's the one because my boy looks like him. But in fact I'm not sure my little one looks like him. I hardly saw him. One evening, he stopped by. That's what I am, Saturnin. A street woman. And so, Miss, what do you eat? Remember Mérargue? Mme Lucien's café. Of course I do. Remember Mme Lucien and her waitresses? Know how they earned money? No, Miss, you mustn't say that. You know it's not right. That's what I do, Saturnin. That's my job. Don't say that. It's not true! Sadly, it is true, Saturnin. It's true. Why'd the idiot go to Marseille? He went to get some tools. You know that, Clarius. Are there none in the village? And his social security papers. You know. And his national service. You know that, Clarius. Nothing more to it? No funny business between you two? No secrets, I assure you Clarius! Because I won't be taken for a fool. Listen, Angèle. Crying gets you wet and does no good. Let's talk like it wasn't you, like it wasn't me. I know I'm sometimes slow to catch on but when it's about you I can understand anything. But I disgust you, why don't you leave? You're making that up, Miss. You're still our Angèle to me. I know it's horrible for you but it's partly my fault too. Not at all! Yes it is. I kept saying, "You need a town gentleman." Yes, but you didn't tell me to call out to passers-by. No, I didn't. I never said that. But listen, this is how I see what's happened. If someone suddenly said, "Angèle fell in some dung," I'd go, I'd pick you up, I'd wash you, very carefully. I'd clean your nails with matchsticks, wash your hair in lavender water, so not a single straw, a stain, a shadow, nothing remained. I'd make you as clean as water and as lovely as ever. Because friendship cleans everything up. Everything. And if one day, just for fun you came to me and said, "Saturnin, do you remember the day I fell in the dung?" I'd say, "What dung?" "Where? How? When?" You know, I saw you when you were so small, I see you clean as when you were born. Saturnin! Mother Philomène would be so happy if you just showed up. Listen, Angèle, when I said earlier they were well I was lying. But don't blame me. Because it was a white lie. This is the truth. They're sad. Really sad, both of them. The master's stopped smoking. What does he do? Nothing. He doesn't talk. He's turned nasty, too. He's always angry. He says, "Great God!" But mother Philomène is so small you can't see her. Like a little warbler bird. And her hair's all white. Even the clock has stopped. Listen, Angèle, come back, and the master will wind the clock up. The train's at 5 o'clock. And Louis? He mustn't come too, cos the master'd kill him. But he would kill me, Saturnin. You don't know him. They're bandits! When a woman falls into their hands, she can't be saved! He'd set fire to the farm! - Our farm? - Yes. Some people are really strange. You learn something new every day. Well, now, what shall we do? Where is it, exactly? Don't you remember the big farm at the beginning of a valley? Marigrate? Marigrate, that's it. 32 francs a day, full board and a litre of wine. I want to go but I didn't dare say yes because of you. Why not? Because it's near the girl's farm. Angèle, the one you took a fancy to. I thought you might not want to go back. Me? Why not? On the contrary, I'd like to. Harvest and threshing in two months. Shall we get hired? I'm in. I'll be happy to go back there. I'll like that. I'll sign up tonight in the bar. Not afraid? Afraid of what? Getting interested again. That's old history now. It's been 15 months. Get the child. Oh, yes, there's the child. How old is he? 10 months. That's good. For the train, I mean. Cos at that age they pay half price, or quarter price, or maybe no price. Since I've only 72 francs... I've got money! No, listen, I'd rather you didn't take that money. That money is... it isn't nice. I'm not criticising. It's funny to think I'll see that child. It scares me. Saturnin... Scared you won't like him? No, Angèle, I'm scared he won't like me. Why'd he go to town? Luckily we didn't meet anyone. A successful expedition. Everything is fine. Now, wait in the shed and I'll go in, normal-like. And skilfully, I'll turn the conversation around to you. But what will Father say? He'll thank me and come and get you straight away! Don't fret, it's the simplest thing in the world. It'll all be fine. I know it will. Let me see him again. Mother Philomène will be happy. She'll be mad about him at once. Here he is. Are you coming in or not? Coming in. What's this business? Listening at doors? Gangster! I was afraid of disturbing you. Come on in, Saturnin. The tools. It was 83 francs and 60 centimes. Here's the receipt, and the change. Did you get everything done? Yes, Mistress. Meet anyone you know? No, no one I know. I forgot to say. I met the young lady. What young lady? Ours. Holy Virgin! What did she say? - She said... - Silence! I forbade you to talk about her. Get undressed. Master, I... Enough! Not one word. Or you leave the house. Off you go! Is she married? No. Is she well? No. Don't stay here and cry! Why didn't you bring her? I did, she's in the shed. My little girl! My little one! Come back here! Master, you're good, so be good. Master, you're a good judge. Don't judge your daughter harshly. My little girl! My little one! Sorry, Mother. My little one! Let's see you. Come on. We're going to beg your father's pardon. He won't touch you, don't worry. Come. I'm not alone, Mother. I have a child. A little boy? Lord, he's handsome! Come here. Here. Come on. Here. Come through here. Whose child is that? He's mine, Father. Yours alone? Mine alone. We know nothing worse can happen now. Your leaving was an ordeal. Your return is another one. An even worse ordeal, you coming with that bastard. I don't want explanations. That child... I don't want it. He's not ours. If you'd had it as you should, it would have been the best gift for this house. But the way it was had, it means nothing to us. It's our ordeal, breathing. A moving, crying shame. Now you've come back, all thin and dirty, hard luck. It's your fault. Leave if you want. If you want to stay I'll feed you both but in secret. I'm not offering you a home but a hideaway. That's what you need. Want to stay? Yes, Clarius. She does. So lock her in the cellar and give me the key. No one must know this shame that's come from town. Go along. Go along! Never speak to me about that again. Fancy a drink? No. Why? It's our last day here. Not coming? I'm off. What on earth for? Listen, Amédée, I lied to you. It's not like me, but I did. When? Every day, since we met up again. About Angèle Barbaroux. I pretended I'd forgotten her, but... it's not true. Reckon I didn't know? Poor lad! It shows when you sleep. I sometimes watch you on your mattress and I can see the marks of your sorrow on your face. Like you've got a bit in your mouth. A snaffle that takes you where it likes and bites into your lips. It shows. What can I do? I asked, down in the village, where she is. Nobody knows. She hasn't been seen since. I asked, too. Same answer. But someone must know where she is. Her family. - Did you go? - No. I don't want to think about it any more. It's eating me away. I've taken my pack and I'm off. Back home. To Baumugnes, in the mountains. Don't leave right away. Leave the village, yes, but don't go straight back home. As soon as you arrive it'll close in on you. And then you'll never get over it. You hear me? And that thing, till the end of time, mixed into the air you breathe. Understand? Listen, Battles with bad things always last a long time. But even when both shoulders have been hit, never say it's over. You get up, you go back in there, and in the end your misery is what's lying on the ground. Believe me. Believe this old man who still knows how to cope with life. That's kind Amédée but what can you do for me? Tell you what, I'll go to that farm. I'll find out what's up. And I'll come and tell you. You wait. Where? Go to the quarries along this road and take the track between the almond trees. Ask for Esmenarde farm, at the end of the road, under the mulberry tree. Say I sent you. Try to see the wife first, because she wears the trousers. Truth be told, I slept with her for over a year. Tell her, "Amédée sent me," and it'll be fine. Leaving right now? Yes. I'll wait there. Do what you must. Beware, the sow bites. The black one. Give her food without going in. I'll soon know what I need to. I'll come to the quarries and tell you. And then, only then, lad, you can go home. Our job will be done. I'll wait till September. Middle of the month. No more. Don't worry, I'll be there. Hello, hello! There. Here, my darling. Give me the little one. Come here, you. How's Father? He's not happy. He doesn't even want the postman to come here. Afraid of a letter for me. He's like a madman. He grabs the gun when he sees someone on the road. And his arm swells and swells and he won't see a doctor. I'm at my wits' end. Water! I bit of a shave, I think. No, I'll look too young. Just what I wanted: clean, but not young. Excuse me, would you be so kind as to tell me if that farm is La Douloire? I know no more than you, my boy. I'm from town. I can see. I've come for Julien's mother-in-law's funeral. I do know the farmer is called Barbaroux. So that's it. La Douloire. Is that where you're going? Well, good luck. The place is mad. Mad? Do you mean nuts? No, not nuts. I mean mad. Earlier, when I wanted to go in, he wouldn't let me. Stopped me with his gun. - Aiming at you? - Yes. It was a very close-run thing. So at a distance I say "I have sad news for you." "Get lost!" says he. "Lucien's mother-in-law's dead," say I. "To hell with her, dead or alive," he says. So I didn't push it. Good evening, lad, and good luck. Blimey! That's all we need. A shot? A shot at me? That's one odd family. Amédée! Hey, Amédée! Going there, or not? Maybe not. But what will Albin say? Maybe the man will take aim, but maybe not fire. Oh well, I'll give a try. Amédée, my friend, nobody forced you to get involved but now you are, get going. And try to be liked. Halt. Sorry to bother you. I wondered if you needed someone to thresh. On your way, lazybones. We don't need you. Listen Boss, I'm not a bad chap. Turn your gun the other way, if you will. I'm not asking for free soup. I'm a worker and I can take orders. Take me on, please. I'm getting on and the big farms don't want me. If the little ones won't have me, I'll just die. You can drop dead, there are still too many more like you. - Get lost! - Boss... - Out! - Boss! Do you want this up your arse? - Do you? - Don't shoot! What is it now? That gun's always in your hands, Clarius. Anyone who comes by asking for water from your well or a slice of bread. Your goodness has gone. No goodness for vagabonds! What's he done to you? You can see he's old. Old... Greetings, Mistress. What do you want, my man? I'm looking for work, Mistress, so I wondered about threshing or something. We could do something. What use can he be? He looks like a chicken thief. Listen, Clarius, don't be stubborn. Your arm won't be better for three months. What would you ask? Let me work it out. We should bring it all up. We've got the mule and Saturnin, but he's not really reliable. Nothing to fear from this one. 12 francs a day, Mistress, board and lodging. How's that? For an idler it's 10 francs too much! If you can spare it, do! That'll do. I can begin right away. I'll get ahead on tomorrow. You can start by cleaning the stable and preparing the grass. Very well. The tools are behind there, in the shed. Yes, Mistress. Is that the tool? Are you no better? What do you want? I'm going to work. - See the boss? - By Jove! Didn't he shoot at you? Do I look like I'd get myself shot? You aren't looking. I saw the boss, he shook my hand and he said, "Excuse me, Sir, would you be so extremely good" "as to clean out my stable?" I can't say no to that, so off I go. And who are you? I'm Saturnin. Saturnin? Well, you're off to a bad start! Angèle, Angèle! I've never seen him before. What's he like? He's old. He looks old. But quite nice. Looks like a countryman. Did you see his hands? No. I don't even know if he's got any. I'm not saying he hasn't any, I just didn't look. What for? To see if they're hard. If they're hard-skinned, like peasants' hands. Yes... If you ask, he'll be suspicious. Shake his hand, like saying hello. Several times. I will, then I'll tell you. Think he's come to start a fire? I don't know. I'm afraid. Watch him. Keep your eyes on him. Don't worry, I'll never turn my back. Supper! Supper! Don't be afraid, I'll touch his hand. Good evening. - Evening, Amédée. - Good evening. Good evening, Amédée! Kiss him, why not? Go ahead if you like. No, I don't want to. Sit down! Where were you? I was out at the back. What for? I was... having a wee. It happens sometimes. You have to. Hitch up the horse early tomorrow. We'll go to the doctor's for this stupid arm. Your bedroom's the old furnace. It's big enough for you. What a family! He moved around all night! He was looking. He opened all the doors. He walked around barefoot with an electric lamp, like a... like someone mysterious. I was sure! The worst is, Master's going to town for his arm today and I'm alone with him. Who knows what he may do? If there's a danger, it's not for today. But keep a good eye. And try to get him to come past, so I can see him. I'll bring him for lunch and have him stand... here. Did you see his hand? Yes. I did feel some hard skin, but maybe it was mine. And I don't know if you're right. He doesn't look like a townie. He knows corn. Been threshing all day. Saturnin! Amédée! Saturnin! Oh no, the master! Saturnin! Here I am! Don't you care that it hurts? I've been waiting an hour! It's ready now. And that dirty beast? Doesn't lift a hand! And the whip? Where is it? The whip's here. Get up there, you! Listen, my boy. What we do is, when the master leaves we shut everything up. It's not about trust. Ask Saturnin. Why are you telling him our business? He can leave if he doesn't like it! Out of the way. Lunch is in the basket. Eat under the trees. Or in the barn. That'll do. Lunch is later. Off to the doctor's. It's shut. They've shut everything up. They do it every time they leave. It's no way to carry on. It isn't. Never seen that before. Does he think we'll pinch his stairs? That man... knows nothing about life. Listen, Médée, let me tell you. Let me tell you. I tell you. Well, tell me! I'm not telling. Have a drink, old stick. That's your bottle. Come on, shut your musical box. Cheers, old mate. Cheers, Amédée. Will you stay here long? Me? I've been here 20 years. I was put into care. Clarius raised me. So ever since then... There you are. Why are you laughing? Me? I'm not laughing. Nothing to laugh at, here. The bosses are sad. Lots of sadness. They look unhappy. But why? Yes, why? Don't play the idiot. You know why. You know well. Of course I know. They've had unhappiness. Nothing but unhappiness. For a long time? Quite... much too long. That doesn't tell me much. No, it doesn't tell you much. I don't know if that's why, but the boss is pretty rough. That's why, yes, that's why. If you'd known him before... See that basket there? He prepared it this morning. But well, after a business like that... But what am I saying? "A business like that." No, no! I don't... You're trying to get it out of me! See what you're like? I'd rather do without my cheese! Saturnin! Your cheese! Don't worry, old thing. I won't try to get it out of you. You're a good man. Why do you say that? Because you're in the old style. You're family. More than by blood and bone. But you're nothing. You're Saturnin. They can say, "Saturnin, we don't need you now. Off you go!" They could say that. You're nothing. Well I value you. Cos the wine was to make you talk. You stood up, stretched out your arms and left. That's how I like men to be. And there must still be some left round here. Makes you feel better. Look, the horse has stopped! Those beasts take advantage of everything. On you go! Go on, now. On you go. - Did you get a good look? - Yes. - I know him. - Great Lord! Louis was with him, the first time. So shall I kill him? No, on the contrary, talk to him. Say I went and never came back. Another white lie? Very well. Tell him... I went to America. With another man. That's sure to work. Amédée! I reckon you're a good friend because you look like one. I've never hurt anyone. I can tell. But you guessed that things had happened here. You can tell. We had a little girl called Angèle. Good as gold. Then one day she went off with a townie. You can say that again. And she's never been back. Has she written? Yes, she wrote once, you know... What can you do? She wrote, that's all. You can say that again! Seems she went to America. Yes, America! Over there they all speak English, smoke cigars, they all ride horses... I couldn't make that up because I've never been to America. You can say that again. Nothing else to say. - To America? - Yes. - So she'll never be back? - No. She's left for good, and no more happiness for you three. Nor for the man who's waiting. What man? - Another one. - Who's waiting? He'll have a long wait. On you go! Ah, that horse... Go on! What is it now? It's me. It's Amédée. Have you seen her? No, I haven't. They took me on. I work there. But they're sad people. And Angèle has gone. That's sad. I knew there wasn't much hope. And the servant even said that she's gone to America. Never mind. Never mind. What shall we do? I'll stay here another week to finish the threshing then I'll leave like I said. Women don't go with the men that deserve them. I'll stay there a bit longer too. Their farm's pitiful. It's all been neglected, so I'll sort it out. And you? Why don't you stay here? Is it no good? Is the food bad? No, the food's fine. The work's not hard, but... The mistress keeps wanting to kiss me and I don't like it. She's always been like that! She's bored, you understand? She's a woman who needs a lot of... some... conversation. Is her husband here? No, he's sleeping out with the herd. Well! Well, out of courtesy, just courtesy, I'll go and say hello. That's right, go and say hello. Dirty so-and-so! Where's that lazy Amédée? Clarius, don't say that. He worked hard yesterday. Did he? And what does he do at night? At 5, he still wasn't here! Had a nice walk? Laying traps so the police will fine us? No, Boss, I went to the village to buy tobacco and got a bit lost on the way. That's why we pay him 12 francs! They're all the same. All pigs! Out of my way! Sit here, my lad. Here's breakfast. Eat. What's up? Me? Nothing. - Tell me. - Yes? What do you have for breakfast? What do I have? Tell me. What do you have? A cup of milky coffee? Can you see me drinking that? No, I've kept my habit from when I was young. I drink a big glass of wine and I have a good chew. Good for the stomach. What about the boss? He has something strong, you might say: a good smelly onion, some anchovy or some strong cheese. Mother Philomène drinks from a bowl? So whose is the little blue cup, then? Be quiet and get to work. I'll tell you whose. No, don't tell me. It's Angèle. The girl. She's here. - You came to get her! - Maybe I did! From Marseille? No, not from Marseille. I came to find her, but not for some bastard. Not for some grotty brothel. It's for a tall man, from the mountain, who's liked her for a long time. A big man who wants her. Tell me where she's hidden. She isn't hidden. She's not here. And anyway, let's get to work. Hey, Saturnin! Look over there. That doesn't look good. Let's get the corn in. Take the bag. There. Why go out in this weather? Think the corn would have come in otherwise? Nasty weather! That it is. - Did you look? - Me? Who's talking to you? - Did you? - No. I'll go right now. Mind the broken branches, Mistress! Mother! Mother! - Clarius, come quick. - What's the matter? You stay here. Well, well, well... Stay there! Come here! A little one! Sweet little thing! Looks like baby Jesus! Saturnin! That's me. Look up, you idiot! Here's 10 francs. Go and get two packets of candles. We have three. Do I have to come down? I'm going! Pétronille, I'll finish you when I get back. Mistress... The threshing is done, all in the barn and ready to be sold. There are 4 or 5 days with nothing to do. Let me have them, I have family to see. Is that the truth? The honest truth. I'll leave everything here. I don't even want you to pay me. When I get back. One recommendation, don't sell anything until I get back. Because the boss is a good man but he has ideas that mean he doesn't make good sales. I'll set the price myself. Where are your relations? Over that way. Well, my lad, that will be all right. Take advantage. But come back. As a favour to me. I'm happier with you here. Thank you. You're a good mistress. Ones like you make good servants. And good farms, when nothing comes and gets in the way. Goodbye, Mistress. Goodbye. Angèle! Bring your bastard down. Follow me. - Well? - Well, everything's fine! I'm off, see. Now? Why not? Your Angèle is there. She's there. I saw her. Talk to her? Don't start asking questions! I need to tell you the whole story. Come with me. So they've shut her in? It's true. And she stays shut in all day and all night? They must be unkind people. No. No, they're not unkind. There's no reason. She came back, who knows where she'd been? You know as well as I do. People here are big on pride, and reputation. A girl who goes away, and with that kind of character, it makes people talk. And wag fingers. And say, "That Barbaroux girl, you know..." If she never comes back, you remain with your misfortune. But no one sees it. But when she comes back, well, she is your daughter after all. Particularly for mothers, they like their cheeks stroked. But people say, "That Barbaroux lot", "the women do what they like." "You know about their daughter..." And those gentle men are all the same. You take your daughter's arm, twist it, push her around, slap her, and with a boot up the backside you throw her in the bedroom. A key turned, and you stay there, fretting. There it is. Even so, they could have shut her in just for a day. Two days. A week. But afterwards... There's no reason. There is a reason. There is one. - There's... - There's what? Well, I kept this for last because it's not the best. It's the worst, even. The important thing is she's back. But you have to remember that in-between times, there was Louis. So what? Those things are important, and they leave marks. So what? So... Well... she has a little one. There. It doesn't matter. Come on, we'll go and get her. Go and get her? Leaving now? - What'll we do there? - We'll think on the way. Off we go. Slow down! Not so fast, Albin! Wait for me in the hut. Yes, I'll be patient but be quick. As quick as I can. Where have you been? I went to get the mountain fellow. Where is he? I left him up in the hut. He's coming for Angèle. But we told you she's not here. We told you she's in America. Tell me, is that what you call the cellar? Amédée! I saw her the day of the storm. - With her boy. - That's not true. It's a white lie. I saw her, I tell you! I know she's here. So that's God's will. Where is she? Today she was in her room. When you left I went to the village. When I came back, she wasn't there. Nor in the cellar. Maybe she left. - Damn. - Yes indeed. Well spoken. Here's the gentleman. Do you think this can last? Last? What? Do you think I pay you to have fun? I never asked for holiday pay. I asked permission. Who did you ask? I'm the person you should ask. There's only one boss here: me! You don't ask women. Don't get mad, Boss. - I thought... - What? Tell me! What are you saying? What did you think? That women rule here? You thought that. Well, by God, I'll show you they don't! It's me! I'm the boss. Clarius Barbaroux, no one else! I do what I like, you hear? Railwayman! Railwayman, me? I'm the boss, I give the orders. Find that idiot Saturnin, and go and fetch some wood. Try to earn your crust. Riff raff! Off you go! Come on, Amédée, drop it. You're right. He's eaten up by it and it itches where he can't scratch it. Let's go and get some wood. Clarius, calm down. I don't recognise you. You aren't yourself any more. You wrong your good blood and you wrong your mind. - Well? - Well... The old man's impossible. This is Saturnin. He knew Angèle as a baby. Carried her on his back. And when she left, he was even sadder than you. Thank you Saturnin. Thanks for what? What you did for her. You say like she's yours. Well, she is. - He's barmy! - No, he isn't. Is he the mountain fellow? Yes, it's me. I'm not sure I trust him. Why not? He's a bit barmy. Come on, Saturnin! Let's talk about this. Let's prepare things. Does he want to marry her? Yes, I do. Now that's good. And will you take the boy too? Yes, I will. He looks silly but what he says is good. Where is she? I don't know and won't say. What should we do? This is how I see it... He has to ask for her. Ask for her? Who does he ask? Her father. That's the way things are done. I never have, but if I'd wanted to marry a woman I'd have asked her father. But I have to ask her first. I must talk to her. To her? Yes, to her. But where is she? Try and find her. And if you don't, I'll find her. How will you? With this. Tonight, with this. Oh dear, he really is barmy. I don't trust him, no I don't. And deliver us from evil. Amen. That's it. Say your prayer to God. That's really worthwhile. Thank Him for all our happiness. And all he's done for our girl. Don't despair, Clarius. We don't know what He'll do. You're just a peasant. You don't know anything. You can keep quiet. And what He does, He does well. We had a bad start but maybe in the end all will be well. Do you hear that? My arm! No... Some music? It's the wind, Clarius. - The wind? - Yes. Or maybe the fever from your arm. Light off, now. I'll switch it off. Do you hear? Yes. Is that him playing music? Yes. It's like in church. If the master hears him... Yes. He's barmy! I fear so. I'll go and see what's happening. Who's that knocking? It's me. The daughter. Angèle. I'm shut in. I'm shut in. Is it you? I've found you. I came for you. I know. I know you. Do you? How? You played the harmonica one evening in the village. Yes, the first time I saw you. And you came the night I left. - Did I? - Yes. I told you it was too late. Wasn't it you? Yes, Miss, it was me. I thought it was a dream. And you cried on my hand? Yes, I did. I've often thought of it. If I'd known, if I'd listened! Miss, you know now. Yes, I do. But it's too late. Miss, the first time you said it was too late. So will it always be? What do you want? The same thing. Always. Just the same. And you? I can't any more. Why not? Because I've changed. I'm no longer the same. Miss, that's your imagination. I tell you, I love you. For me you'll always be the same, just as I saw you that first evening. No. I know I've changed. Listen. I'll tell you everything. You remember Louis? What you said about him? It was true. I know, Miss, I know. He sold me to everyone. Everybody. I know. I called to men in the street. I was everyone's woman. I was ashamed of my body. When my mother brings me food I don't dare say, "I want to kiss you." I feel dirty. I'm the lowest of them all. I sold my skin to earn some money. Don't cry, Miss, don't cry. For me, you will always be the loveliest of them all. And the most unlucky. I want you. - And you? - Oh, I wish I could! I wish... What should I do? Here, Miss. I'm going to slip my knife under the door. You can use the blade as a screwdriver for the lock. Will you manage? I'll try! Albin, what are you doing here? Waiting. She's coming with me. - Is she in there? - Yes, with the child. We've spoken, and she's coming with me. Does she want to? Yes. Well I never! What? I feel like a right idiot. That's amazing. Who would ever have thought? How's it going, Miss? Nearly finished. Oh, Mother! There. What are you doing? Nothing. I was just thinking. Watch out. You've eaten my bread. If you betray me... The door's opened. Maybe your father. Hurry up or we're done for. I'll catch up with you. If he questions me, he'll lose five minutes. Quick! I'll catch up. - What are you doing? - Swine! Are you mad? We're not going to kill her! An honest boy is taking her. He's going to marry her! - Understand? - Kill me, you swine! Kill you? Me, kill you? You're the swine! There! There goes your gun! You're just a cretin, Clarius! So, children, shall we have a chat? Yes! My legs are aching. I'm not used to walking. Poor thing. Even with you to lean on. I'm close to you. Thanks, my lovely. Hurry up. I didn't know he would take her. I thought he'd ask you. - Hitch up the horse! - What for? - If I catch them, I'll kill them. - Come on, now. - Hitch up the horse, you! - No, I won't! Clarius, come along now. - I'll hitch it up! - Now now, Clarius... - Albin! - What? It's all wrong, my boy. A good job doesn't begin with something nasty. Yes. And? That's all. You're saying exactly what I feel. I waited for you to speak first because of her, you see. You know how I wanted her. And now it's morning and I have a clear road ahead and bright sunshine. Want me to go and ask her father? You have to, my boy. It's the right thing to do. We agree, Amédée, but it's not just me now. What do you say? I'll do what you want. But if we don't go, I'll never forget. I do so wish he'd kiss my son once. Just once. I'm sure it'd bring him luck. So we agree, my wife. Let's go, Amédée! Think about it. If you're doing it for my esteem then don't go. No, it's for my self-esteem. Cos that's not all. When we all get there, there's Clarius's gun. We can count on that. That's for sure. Never mind, we're going. Come along. Clarius, they won't be coming back! And he's an honest boy. If I find them, I shoot them, or my name isn't Clarius! Come on. Who are you? I'm Albin, from Baumugnes. My father was Lionel, my mother's Marie. We're not rich but I've a bit of land and it'll give us bread and flowers. Honest family? All Baumugnes ones are. And you want my girl? Yes. I'm asking for her hand. Come with me, lad. Lad, you're asking for my daughter but... I can't give her. We're not clean. We lost our honour. All we can do now is not dirty others. Understand? Master, your words are good and right. But I want her anyway. That child you had has no father, you know? So he needs one. And all your life, in your house, there'll be a stranger. So? He'll have brothers and sisters. When we've finished, we won't even know whose he is. You can have her. But I can't give her. But I want you to. Master, give me her. I had a daughter, and I lost her. By asking, I gave her back. Why? If she marries an honest man, you can call her "daughter". Albin, you're young. Listen to me. Everyone will laugh at you. They'd better hide, then. Master, give me her. I'll turn my back and you can go. Why must I consent? I can't. I won't and I can't. Why not? If you were my son and you asked to marry a girl like that, I'd say no. So how can I? It'd be a crime against your father. He's dead? Yes, he's gone. If he was still here, what would he say? If he was still here, I'd bring Angèle to his door and say, "Here she is." "She's done this and that, done bad things." "But not for her, not for pleasure." "And she suffered." And he'd say, "In that case, she's forgiven." And he'd take her hand, sit her down by the fireplace and give her the 3 keys: the door key, the cellar key and the smallest one, the laundry cupboard key. Master, do think. She did wrong, but now there's a little child who laughs in his sleep. And we know about it. Let's forget it, it's over. That's too easy. No one punished for doing wrong. It's not for us to punish. Who are you to judge? She did wrong, but you did worse. Me? Shutting a little child in a cellar. He's a bastard, not a child. That's for other folk. If his grandad thinks that, his grandad's a bastard. Is that what you think? Yes. What shall we do? Be patient. He'll think. What's the point in thinking? It's his pride. I understand the man. But we've done what we had to. He didn't even look at the boy. One morning, at Angèle's place, all that was left was a piece of paper. Here it is. The letter she left. Then another day, back she comes carrying a child. One that should never be seen. So, my poor Albin, I felt myself becoming all dirty, all black. I felt full of fleas. Like when you clean out the well. I stopped going to the village. I stopped digging the earth, because... it was cleaner than me. Master, give me that. There, it's burning. Angèle, that's it! Here! Angèle, come here! Like before. If only it could be. It's easy, you'll see. Angèle, give me your hand. Master Clarius Barbaroux, I saw your daughter one evening in the village and fell in love. I've spoken to her and we're agreed. I'm here to ask for her. Angèle, did you hear? Do you want this lad? I'll do what you say. Very well. Ask your mother. Philomène! Sit down, my boy. Give me that. Here. Here's a lad asking for our girl. What do you say? Clarius, have you forgiven? Oh, please... Let's not start. Nothing to forgive. Too many people to be forgiven. Maybe me first. Well said! Look at that idiot there. Saturnin! Go and get two chickens for dinner. Off I go! Don't cry, Philomène. Understand? We've paid enough. Give us a drink. Angèle, fetch me my pipe, will you? And you, son, tell me: What's your area like? It's a plateau up on the hill. There's grass and almond trees. Clear water everywhere. Lucky you! That's what we lack. Thank you, my dear. Sit at your place. Don't you grow corn? We have to. But it's not as good as in the plains. Naturally. Mostly we have meadows and trees. Flowers. Saturnin! What's up? I'm chasing chickens. No luck with the second one. But where are you going? Leaving? Yes, now it's all sorted out here there's nothing more for me to do. So I'm back on the road again. They'll all be sad about that. They've got plenty to do. Tell them I've gone, and if next winter I'm out of work, which is likely, maybe I'll go up to Baumugnes just to say hello. For friendship's sake. Tell them... Tell them all I'm fond of them. Goodbye, Saturnin. Bye, Amédée.
