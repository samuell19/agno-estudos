In a few minutes, you're gonna receive the platinum album award for selling over a million albums. How does that feel? Well, it's hard. I feel good and bad, you know. I mean, for our album to become this popular after all these years of being out of release, never being heard on the radio... You gotta understand, with Eddie, music was everything. I mean, it wasn't just songs or records. With Eddie, music was your whole life. Now tell me something, Sal. What's this whispering we hear around about some surprise announcement? Does it have something to do with the old band? I'm sorry. I can't talk about it. All right, Sal. Well, the tension is building up right here at Club Metropolis. ♪ She'll never know ♪ ♪ just how I feel ♪ ♪ From out of the shadows ♪ ♪ she walks like a dream ♪ ♪ Makes me feel crazy, ♪ ♪ makes me feel so mean ♪ ♪ Ain't nothin' gonna save you ♪ ♪ from a love that's blind ♪ ♪ You slip through the dark side ♪ ♪ across that line ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Ain't nothin' gonna save you ♪ ♪ from a love that's blind ♪ ♪ You slip to the dark side ♪ ♪ across that line ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ On the dark side ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ All right, everybody!

Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! All right, all right. Hold on here! At this time, I'd like to introduce somebody from Satin Records. These are the people who reissued Eddie and the Cruisers. I'd like to introduce a man by the name of Dave Pagent who has something you all want to hear. Before Eddie Wilson died, he was working on a new album. An album called "Season in Hell." Now you all know that Eddie Wilson is the greatest, right? Satin Records has just reacquired the lost tapes of Eddie Wilson's never-released album, "Season in Hell"! And we at Satin Records are now gonna release it just for you! Now, here it is in its world premiere! Yeah! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! What I want is songs that echo. The stuff we're doing now is like somebody's bed sheets. You spread 'em out, soil 'em, ship 'em out to laundry, you know? But our songs, I wanna be able to fold ourselves up in 'em forever. You understand? ♪ Bad moon ♪ ♪ on the horizon ♪ ♪ Somethin' ♪ ♪ in the air today ♪ ♪ Hear the sound ♪ ♪ of thunder ♪ It's a pretty good imitation of Eddie. Who is it? When we reacquired the "Season in Hell" album, we found another totally unrelated tape in the box, a mystery tape, this tape. - And you think this is Eddie? - Don't you? It can't be. Eddie always played with me. I knew every song he knew. - I knew everything that he... - No, this is Eddie. What are you tryin' to pull here? There aren't any tricks, Sal. I've had the tape analyzed and experts agree that this is Eddie Wilson. Screw the experts. I was his best friend. I would know if he was doin' somethin'. No, no. His music was his best friend, Sal. Don't you understand? Eddie did not think you belonged in this session. He started playing with other musicians 'cause he was leaving you behind, pal. That's a lie. You're a goddamn liar! Eddie wouldn't... ♪ Somehow it's ♪ ♪ never good enough ♪ ♪ At times it's hard ♪ ♪ to tell the difference ♪ ♪ Between what you know ♪ ♪ is right and wrong... ♪ Eddie Wilson was my best friend. That meant something back then. Maybe you don't understand that. ♪ When you feel a little lonely ♪ ♪ Never asked ♪ ♪ this world for much ♪ Hey, no, Lew! Wait a minute! Wait, Lew. Lew! Sal's not thinkin' it's Eddie makes this even better. What are you talkin' about? Let me explain it to you. The "Season in Hell" album - will for sure be a big hit. - So? But now, now we raise the question of who the hell played on the mystery tape, where was it recorded, and, best of all, were these songs recorded after Eddie Wilson died? What the hell you gettin' at, Dave? What I'm gettin' at is creating a rock 'n' roll mystery. We don't know how old this new tape is. It could have been recorded before or after Eddie Wilson's car went off that bridge. Because Eddie Wilson's body was never found. That's right. After "Season in Hell" goes gold, we announce that we have discovered this mystery tape. Release each cut of it as a single and promote the hell out of it. Get people to start believin' that Eddie could still be alive. You know, "Eddie lives" kind of stuff. We could arrange sightings of Eddie. Newspaper articles, maybe even a TV special. People do not want their heroes to die. And that stuff sells records, Lew. Lots of records. So what do you think?

That's your brother over there, right? You have an amazing face. You know that? Yeah, so do you. But I'm here to watch a hockey game, okay? I'd like to paint your portrait. Seriously, this is my card. I'm an artist. - No, thanks. - Please? I mean it. Hey, lady, do you do this all the time? When I see a face that expresses something like yours, yeah. So what does my face express? Distance. Like someone looking for something they can't have. Do you know what I mean? Sounds like sad painting. No, thanks.

That guy over there bought you a drink. Tell him thank you. Thanks. How'd you know I liked Irish Mist? I was in this club in Jersey a few years ago to see Ike and Tina Turner play. Man, that was a while ago. This young horn player comes in late, trips on a Mic cord, falls into the first row and plays the whole first set sittin' on his ass. Man, you got a good memory. You got a good sound, man. Sounds like a bell skippin' across a clear lake. Reminds me of Wendell Newton. Wendell Newton? I knew Wendell. Long before he joined Eddie and the Cruisers. Then we just lost touch. Man, Wendell was as crazy as anybody I ever met. But a sweeter man you'd never find. He just couldn't shake the monkey, that's all. Yeah. How'd you know Wendell? I'd hear him playin' in clubs. Do you Mall? Guitar. Hey, I thought I heard you say you play guitar. Yeah, I play guitar. Oh. Well, Hilton knows that I'm looking for a new guitarist. Why? You wanna try out? Before you add one, you oughta learn to play it yourself. Hey, man, excuse me. What did you say? I said your bass player can't sing, and you come in on a wrong beat. I come in on the wrong beat? Yeah, that's right. You should kick it, not step on it. Who are you, buddy? Segovia? Who the hell do you think you are comin' down here tellin' me how to play with my band? Somebody should. Hey, Rick. Let him play. A man's music speaks louder than his words. Let's see what you got. All right. Here, man, be my guest. Be my guest. This should be funny. This should be completely hilarious. Hey, guys, let him play. All right.

I saw the name of this bar on the matches you used at the hockey game. Guess it was luck. Yeah, right, luck. You go there often? Yeah. Seems like once too often. So you're a tough guy, huh? You're right, you know. I couldn't paint you. I couldn't capture how tough you are on canvas. I'd probably need a hammer and chisel just because you're so tough. Wait a minute. You really come looking for me to... Yes, I want to paint you. You need a ride somewhere? After you see my work, maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe I won't. And maybe you will. If that's not your band, then where do you play? I don't. Why not? You're very good. Not good enough. You really like green and blue, huh? Mm-hmm, but the red is what's important. I'm trying to exhaust myself with red. I don't get it. At least you're honest. No, I didn't mean that. I like your paintings. My first showing's next week. I hope the critics agree with you. Didn't I see you earlier today? Excuse me? Excuse me, sir? - Yeah? - Do you know where West is? Aw, shit. Joe West? Think he's down there. - Ah, there he is. Great. - Yeah, there he is. Hey! Hey, Joe! Joe, wait! I wanna talk to you! This sucks! This is for the birds, man! Whoa! Nice view, huh? Especially down. Yeah, right. Look, I was wondering if you wanted to be in my band. You don't need me, kid. Man, you are really good. The city's full of good players. Go find one of 'em. Look, at least come and jam with me. I'll think about it, okay? Thanks. I got a question. I'm gonna take the elevator down with you. I don't wanna go down those stairs again. You got a union card? No. Not bad. Not bad? What the hell's that supposed to mean? Not bad means not bad. And I suppose thanks for nothin' means thanks for nothin', right? Listen, if I was in a bar and I heard you playin', it'd be nice being in there. Then I'd go home and I'd forget all about it. That's what not bad means. Thanks a lot, man. Hey, you don't want the truth, don't ask! Make up your own, like everybody else. Look, man, I wanna learn. Is that okay? You ain't gonna learn nothin' by impressing yourself with some five-minute guitar riff. I mean, it was good. It would dazzle an audience. But that's the easy part. Okay, okay. Hold on a second, hotshot. Why don't you show me something I don't know? Music's gotta live, man. It's gotta breathe. Just let it breathe. Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that? Practice. And hard work. Here they come! - Mr. Eisen! - Mr. Eisen! Who played backup on the mystery tape - if it wasn't the Cruisers? - That we don't know. But we are offering a $25,000 reward for anyone who can tell us. And we need to know when these songs were recorded. What are you implying? Well, Eddie Wilson's body was never found, right? So you think Eddie Wilson's still alive? Well, let's just say, it's still a mystery, okay? Why do you think he hasn't turned up? When I talk to him, I'll let you know. So you do know where he is? We have had reports that he's been seen in 12 states and in Paris, France. We're checking that out. How long are you gonna keep up this scam? What scam? Get out of here. So, how long do you think we can keep up this, uh, scam? As long as we got records to sell. Do you paint? Buildings. Oh. What kind of buildings? Big ones. You know, this work doesn't do a thing for me. What do you think? Me, I like the way she exhausts the reds. Oh. I told you, your work needs a warmer feel. I paint what I see. You've only sold two paintings. Make that three. Excuse me? I said make that three. I wanna buy this one. You can't just rip the paintings out of the display! If there's any damage, you are going to pay for it. Hey, pal, the only damage I see is you don't understand her work. This is a private showing. Do you have an invitation? Diane invited me. That was a mistake! Oh, yeah, it was. And not my first. Hey, come on. Take it easy. You'll have other shows. Your first show is the most important. I was hoping... forget it. Let me give you a ride home. I'd rather walk. Well, I'd like to walk with you, but I just bought this painting and I like it a lot, and I don't want it to get ruined. So help me put it in my car, huh? Do you really like it? Yeah. I can't believe you did it from memory. Come on, I wanna show you something. What are you doing? I thought you were taking me home. Don't you wanna go roller skating? Why in the hell would I wanna go roller skating? Why not? Because I just screwed up, I'm very depressed, and I don't know how to roller skate. That's perfect. I don't either. Come on. This is nuts. I know. Come on, huh? Ah! Are you all right? If you want, I should lay that girl out. Come on. Having fun yet? Joe, I'm never gonna be able to do this. Sure, you can. Just follow the flow of my legs, dear. What? One foot? One foot at a time. You can try to move both of them, but you'll probably fall. You know how to roller skate, don't you? Let's see. Whoa! All right, skaters! Get ready for some exciting music! Tonight right here at Bobby's Rink, we're gonna give you a preview of the mystery tape from the great Eddie Wilson! Satin Records' latest release. Yes, it's called "Emotional Storm"! Yeah What's wrong? My legs got tired. You didn't seem tired. Just take your skates off and let's get outta here, okay? Fine. Hey, how you doing, man? Listen, I was thinkin' about what you were talkin' about. Forget about what I said, whatever it was. You were right, man. My music was missing something. Man, get off my back! Remember when we were jamming the other day? Well, I made a tape cassette, man. - You gotta hear this. - Not now. Come on. I gotta talk to you about my band. Come here, kid. I don't wanna talk to you about any goddamn band! So get off my back, all right? Joe, take it easy. Let him go. Man, I just wanted to jam with you. If you don't want it, fine. Come on. I don't feel right keeping your painting without paying for it. So when I get the money together, I'll come back for it. So you do remember how to talk, huh? I mean, you haven't said a word all the way here. Why did that guy make you so mad? He wants me to join his band. So, why don't you? You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - Why do you care? I do care. Diane, I don't wanna hurt you. Then I just won't let you. Good morning. Joe, last night you were scared of something. I could feel it. Does that guy have something on you? No. Then what's the matter? There's some happening in my life I just can't handle. Go on, please. Diane... a long time ago I had a band. I wanted to create the perfect sound, the perfect music. I spent a whole year working on this album. And when I was done, I was proud of it. And then I handed it in, then this guy at Satin Records, he told me it was garbage. He said I was finished. The album was unreleasable. I can't go through that again. I'm sure people have forgotten your old band by now. - You could start... - No! That's the point! Nobody's forgotten! I hear it and see it every goddamn day on radio, television! It's drivin' me crazy! They like me better dead than alive! What do you mean, dead? What band are you talking about? The Cruisers, Eddie and the Cruisers. What are you saying, Joe? I'm Eddie Wilson. Oh, come on. You and 10 other guys, right? I've seen those lookalike contests. Eddie Wilson died when his car went over a bridge. Didn't he? Didn't he? I still don't remember what happened. I was driving. The car hit the guardrail of the bridge and I lost control. I remember swimming. I was thinking about Wendell Newton, the sax player from the Cruisers. But he was dead. I got out. I just split. I left everyone and everything behind. And I hurt a lot of people. For 20 years, it's been tearin' me apart. Everybody thinks I'm dead. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Why not just tell everyone? I mean, people want Eddie to be alive, Joe. Yeah, people like Lew Eisen so he can get rich off an Eddie Wilson freak show. Then don't say who you are and just play. I won't measure up. You should do it. You should do it. Great! That is great! You know something, though? I knew you were gonna change your mind. You knew more than I did, kid. First thing we gotta do is put together a new band. Well, what's the matter with my old band? Not much. What you need is drums, keyboard and a new bass player. That's it. He's just playing for some kids now, - but I saw him last week at the... - Yeah, I know. He was good. - Hey, Bobby! - How you doin'? Rick tells me you're lookin' for a serious dude. I should tell you, I'm never serious except with these. Good. He'll do. Hitting the number two spot on the radio and records music charts this week is the first single off the Eddie Wilson mystery tapes. Now here's the big news. Our friends at Satin Records have upped their offer to 100,000 big ones. That's $100,000 to anybody who has proof as to who's playing backup on this Eddie Wilson mystery tape series. Now let's do some cruisin' for just you and me. ♪ Out beyond ♪ ♪ that blue horizon ♪ ♪ Lies the untold tales ♪ ♪ of our life ♪ Okay. Quinn, I'd like you to meet Joe West. How you doin', man? Okay. Rick's been scoutin' you for a couple of weeks. He tells me you're thinkin' about joining another band. What sort of music are we talkin' about? The real kind, man. In. You think he'll fit in our band? He'd fit in my band. He plays six instruments. I heard him. I couldn't care less if he played 60 instruments. - Shh! - Shh! Look at the guy. He's a goofball. Look at the vest he's wearing. Even a clown wouldn't be caught dead wearing a vest like that. He don't play with his vest, man. - Shh! - Shh! Yeah, solid, man. Let's do it! You're laggin', man. I know. I'm sorry. Charlie, you're all over the place, man. Bring it in! We ain't in a pocket, guys! It's coming. He'll get it. No, man. What is that? You said play more intense! Louder ain't more intense. Then what is? What is more intense? I was in the desert once out in the middle of nowhere, absolutely nowhere, just me, the sand and silence. But if you know what to listen for, it ain't silent out there. I heard a music out there I never heard before. In the silence. That's what I'm after, kid. That's intense. You dig down deep and touch something like that, people are gonna listen. They'll listen to you because you got something to say. Not just something to show. Do you understand? Yeah, I think I know what you're talkin' about. If you've just joined us, our guest tonight is Wendy Green. Miss Green claims to be married to the legendary rock star, Eddie Wilson. Now let me get this straight. You've been married to Eddie Wilson - for the last 10 years? - That's right. But when he died, Eddie Wilson was single. My Eddie, he didn't die. And you have two kids by him? Eddie, Jr. and Edwina. Uh, let's go to phone calls from our viewers with questions or comments for our guest. Hi. I think that woman's crazy. I mean, Eddie and I, we've been together since I met him in Vegas. And we got three kids. Oh, no. Wherever Eddie Wilson is, I sure hope this album goes platinum so he can support all these children. Let's take another call. Man, we gotta go on the road and get some exposure. We gotta practice. - Well, that's all part of it. - No, that's all of it. We need like six months, man. Forget the road. We can't. I already made some bookings for us. What? We're supposed to leave tomorrow morning. Who the hell do you think you are, booking us? Well, I was doing it for the band! I'll decide what the band needs! You learn to play your damn guitar! Okay, fine. Well, what do you guys think? I don't know, man. Joe's right. We gotta practice. Our music's not bad. But, you know, you need an audience to make music work. Without nobody to listen, might as well play for yourself. Hilton, the kid's in such a rush. Well, what's the matter with that, man? Hey, a man in a rush starts taking shortcuts. And I won't shortcut the music! Okay, fine. I'll cancel all the dates. All right, wait a minute. We'll go on the road... to practice. Let's get on with the music. - Whoa! - We're here! You animals! - Hey, bro. - What's up? - What took you so long? - Hey! All right, brother. Let me give you a hand with that. - Got it? - Whoa! Hey, man, what's going on? What do you mean? Well, she's not coming with us, is she? She's coming with me. - Man, I got no room! - Make room. Hey, Hi, how you doin', man? Hey, man.

You guys have got a good sound. Thanks. It's a little unpolished maybe... We haven't been together that long. We're still workin' out the kinks. Well, when you get 'em worked out, why don't you give me a call and I'll give you an audition. Oh, this is great. For sure, I'll call you. Yeah. Your lead singer? He sounds a bit like Eddie Wilson. You might wanna capitalize on that. You know, all this Eddie Wilson crap goin' on. Oh, this is great! Mwah! Love ya. Hey, did you hear her idea? I mean, you know, you do sound a little bit like Eddie Wilson. - I think it would be a great... - Forget it, kid. Eddie Wilson's dead. The only thing that's gonna make us is our music. ♪ Here comes the kingfish ♪ ♪ up from New Orleans ♪ ♪ He's got a fist full of dollars... ♪ And you're sure that is Eddie Wilson playing on that tape? Oh, absolutely. In fact, we are now offering $250,000 for bona fide proof that Eddie Wilson lives. Aren't you a little worried that this guaranteed reward is really a publicity stunt to sell more Eddie and the Cruiser albums? No, not at all. You see, this is not a marketing technique, Mr. King. We are after the truth. And I assure you, we will pay anyone $250,000 the moment they can prove to Satin Records that Eddie Wilson lives. Whoa! Give me a hand here. Sorry, door. Hey, quick, give me my case. Not that one, the other one. Hey, girls, wanna come back to see another show?

Hey, don't tell me what to do. I was just returning the favor. God damn it, Joe! - Where are you going? - Away from you! Wait a minute! Diane, I'm sorry. You have the band to kick around. What do you need me for? I just said I'm sorry. It's okay. I kind of liked seeing you jealous back there. It surprised me. Yeah, it surprised me, too. Well, Satin Records has already released two songs from the so-called Eddie Wilson mystery tape. What makes you so sure it's not Eddie Wilson? - It can't be. - Why not? Eddie was a standup guy. If he were alive today, I would be right there next to him. He wouldn't have to hide from me. I was his friend. Well, despite your protests, there are a lot of people who disagree. In fact, we're gonna go right now to another Eddie Lives party sponsored by Satin Records. They are celebrating the release of the third song from the Eddie Wilson mystery tape.

Ooh. That was cruel. - Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen. - What? There. Right there. Oh, that's great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Yeah! Joe, I just talked to Lyndsay Caputo over at the Festival. She's coming to meet us at the gig next week. I didn't tell you to do that. We ain't ready to audition. I guess it's a difference of opinion. The Festival is my call, Rick. Look, you may be happy playing these dives, man, but I want a record deal. I want the magazine covers. I want the videos. Hey, how many times I gotta tell you? It's the music that counts, not the hype! Not the hype, I know. But we all wanna play the Festival. Oh, you're all in on this? Joe... You know I've seen a lot of bands come and go. Most aren't very good. But once in a while, a very long while, one comes along that's worth saving. Well, that's gonna be up to you. All right. This is how it's gonna go down. We find a place. Some place with no distractions. And we rehearse until I say we got it right. Then we audition. ♪ We had a dream ♪ ♪ you once believed in ♪ ♪ That burned inside you ♪ ♪ like a fire ♪ ♪ Your big wheel ♪ ♪ keep on turnin' ♪ ♪ Somehow that dream, ♪ ♪ it passed you by ♪ Hold it!

Our rock 'n' roll musicologist, Merrill Schindler, has this report. Merrill? Thank you, Martha. I analyzed one guitar solo. And my computer gave me one name. The name was the legendary Bo Diddley. We've got Bo Diddley live via satellite. Bo, how are you doing? Just fine, thank you. Bo, where were those sessions held? Oh, in Jersey. A little place outside of, um, Newark, uh, called Lakehurst. Now for the important question. When were those sessions held? I wish I knew. The years kind of, you know, blend together. Who else was there? Eddie was kind of running things along with his sax player, Wendell Newton. Come in here and listen to this! That definitely clears up a mystery for me. Martha, the presence of Wendell Newton obviously dates these sessions as happening before Eddie Wilson's death. Which means that... Which means that we have no proof that Eddie Wilson lived. And in my opinion, we can put to rest those grisly rumors that Eddie Wilson's still alive somewhere. I think this guy should drop dead. Dear Mr. Eisen... I got a band and my lead singer sings a lot like Eddie Wilson. I hope you'll listen to this tape and if you like it, please contact me as soon as possible. Yours truly, Rick Diesel. Damn it, man! You say this is gonna take us another month? Man, we're gonna miss the Festival! We just ain't ready, man! Oh, according to you, we're never gonna be ready! Look, we need more time! More time, man? What are you talking about? I think you're afraid to go onstage. You're afraid to put it on the line, man! You don't know what you're talkin' about. Oh, yeah? Then why are we hiding out in a cabin here, man? - Playing for the goddamn trees! - Shut up! We're all ready to play this goddamn Festival! You're ready? Yeah? Then do it! No. Let him go. First you destroy your guitar. Now your songs. You gonna be next? They're lousy songs. They don't even burn good. Good thing you know 'em by heart. Be a shame to lose that many songs by Eddie Wilson. I knew the minute I heard you play. The way a man plays, he's born with it. Like fingerprints. He can hide under another name, but he can't disguise the way he plays. Then it's a good thing I'm quittin'. You're not quittin' now, Eddie. You owe it to this band. You brought them this far. They deserve another chance. Just like you had a chance. But they ain't gonna get it without you. You owe it to them, Eddie. And you owe it to me. ♪ Tell the boys now, ♪ ♪ I'm trying to stay cool ♪ ♪ This little girl, ♪ ♪ she breaks all of the rules ♪ ♪ Her pretty lies ♪ ♪ make me feel so sad ♪ ♪ But I still want her ♪ ♪ And I want her bad ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ 'Cause when ♪ ♪ she holds me tight ♪ ♪ Mariah, ♪ ♪ won't you say you will? ♪ ♪ Mariah, you give me ♪ ♪ such a chill ♪ ♪ Mariah, girl, ♪ ♪ you're just like the wind ♪ ♪ You fill my sails ♪ ♪ and then you blow me away ♪ ♪ Hey, pretty Mariah ♪ ♪ She's a woman ♪ ♪ She can make ♪ ♪ my blood run cold ♪ ♪ She's a woman ♪ ♪ Give me shivers ♪ ♪ down to my soul ♪ ♪ Her heart of stone ♪ ♪ She can't control ♪ ♪ I just can't leave her ♪ ♪ Mariah, ♪ ♪ won't you say you will? ♪ ♪ Mariah, you give me ♪ ♪ such a chill ♪ ♪ Mariah, girl, ♪ ♪ you're just like the wind ♪ ♪ You fill my sails ♪ ♪ and then you blow me away ♪ ♪ Hey, pretty Mariah ♪ You guys are too good to be just an opening act.

If we can't be great, then there's no sense in ever playin' music again, Sal. - Dad? - Yeah? Can I go play with Richie? Sure. Come here. What's this? - What? - Aw, Dad. Okay, Richie, I'm coming, I'm coming! Son of a... Jesus Christ! You son of a bitch! You son of a... Son of a bitch. Jesus Christ! You been dead for 20 years, God damn it! I gotta talk to you, Sal.

What kind of person does that to a friend? Shit. I was your best friend, God damn it! Why did you do it? I couldn't handle it. You couldn't handle it? I hate you, man. I came back 'cause I need you, Sal. I really need you, man. Yeah? What about all the times I needed you? I'm scared. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Sal? I need you to forgive me. Please. I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry. Come here, you. What's all this bullshit about the mystery tapes? You and Wendell coming here to play 20 years ago? It was just an experiment, Sal. Look, Wendell knew these guys that had a recording studio here, that's all. The funny thing is that there I was, playing with the greatest. Bo Diddley, King Curtis, thinkin' this is great.

That's what got me thinkin', wonderin'. I started thinkin' I wasn't good enough. Then Wendell died. I couldn't take it anymore. 'Cause it was my fault. Wendell OD'd. Why do you blame yourself for Wendell's death, huh? Because I could have saved him. I was pushin' the band to get a sound, and I didn't care about anybody. You didn't kill Wendell. The monkey was on his back long before he ever met you. Wendell was just a player, like all of 'em. Maybe that's why they treated that night like it was any other night. And that should tell you somethin'. Don't worry about being good enough. Just go out there and play it the best you can play it, that's all. Hey, Sal, you know I got a new band up there in Canada. I could sure use you. Nah, I got my own life here. You were the best in the band, man. That's bullshit. I was just a guy from Jersey who played bass. Maybe the band... I don't know. Maybe the band would have held you back. Who knows? Maybe this time, you can get it right. Well, kid, you finally got what you wanted. Thanks to you. Nah, I think you got that one backwards. You Rick Diesel? - Yeah, that's right. - Come with me. There's some guys backstage that wanna meet you. 15 minutes, everybody! Let's get ready! - You Joe West? - Yeah. Telegram. - Thanks. - Uh-huh. Fan mail? Yeah, from an old friend. Lookin' good. - You Rick Diesel? - That's me. - Lew Eisen. - How you doin'? Excellent! Come with me. - So you liked the tape? - Yeah, it's all right. It was only a fast demo tape. But, hey, man, this is great you coming up here. Look, I want you to meet Joe. Come here. Yeah, sure. Joe, you ready? - Yeah. - Okay, good. Now I'm gonna introduce the band. Hey, Joe! - Hey, Joe! - No. I always introduce the band after the first song. Hey, Joe, I want you to meet somebody. - Are you Joe West? - Yeah, I'm Joe West. Lew Eisen, Satin Records. Hey, come on, Joe. Mr. Eisen here wants to give us a record deal. - He hasn't even heard us yet, kid. - I sent him a tape. - You what? - Just a sample. You son of a bitch! Who do you think you are, man? What's wrong with that, man? There's nothin' wrong with that, kid. Well, I'll be goddamned. I don't believe it. Stay away from me, man. Eddie, we'll do it your way this time. I've changed. I even like what you're doing now. What is this Eddie stuff? Whatever Eddie Wilson wants! What the hell is going on here, man? Eddie! Eddie, come back! Look, we are on your side on this, Eddie! Eddie! Look, we really love the music! Joe, wait! So tomorrow everyone's gonna know! - But you still got tonight! - To do what? To do what you want! To play what you want! Nobody cares what I wanna play! You do! You care! Give me the keys! - Where are you going? - Give me the goddamn keys! Get out! Look, you've got one chance left to prove that the music is there for you and that chance is tonight, because tomorrow, everybody is gonna know who Joe West really is! Diane, I don't wanna hurt you. So get out of the car. Just get out. Okay, fine. Let's go for a ride, huh? And maybe we can find a bridge and do it right this time, huh? I don't give a damn! Get the band out onstage! Look, Joe's not even here! Eddie, whatever! Look, either you get out onstage and play or I send out the next act. Relax, lady, we are the next act.
