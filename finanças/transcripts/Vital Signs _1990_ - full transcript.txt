- Race? - Sure. Up and back. - Steroids. - Yeah, right. Mike Chatham, third year. - I can't seem to find your name. - You can't find it? Guess I'll have to give up being a doctor and take you out to breakfast instead. Save the bedside manner for someone else. Chatham, group eight. OB-GYN. - How about a rain check on breakfast? - Lucky me. Never rains in California. Chatham! - Hayes! - What are you? - Eight. What are you? - The same. - All right. Great. - Yeah, great for you. I can kiss Honors good-bye with you in my group. Hello, Michael. - Julie. - Unbelievable! - You and Julie? - Not anymore. How was love in Denver? There's this lab assistant. She's, like, naked under her coat. - No, she works like that? - Every day. Try to keep your beaker steady with that in the room. Hayes, you tell that story to one more person... - Suzanne. - Hey, Michael. Hey. Tell me it's not too late to quit med school and come away to Paris with me. It is, Michael. I already paid for this year. Children. Out of the 98 available male third-year students, how come I get the one guy that I've roomed with for five years? - What did I do to deserve this? - You? What about me? - Group eight? - Verily. - Hey, Hayes. How's it goin'? - Great. - Suzanne. Chatham. You're in this group? - Hi, Kenny. That's good. That's good. Two surgeons. Great. Maybe I can skip surgery rotation altogether. - Nobody'll know I'm missing. - Yeah. Hayes passed out last Thanksgiving when I asked him to carve the turkey. Completely untrue. Absolute slander. - Gina. Hey. - Hey! - Hi, Gina. - Michael. Kenny. How's Lauren? Don't faint. We got hitched this summer. You were the one who always said marriage made you soft. Yeah, well, it turns out it makes you sharper. - Hey, Mike. Guys. - It's Gant. You can always tell it's the first day of the year. - Gant's nose isn't brown yet. - What you guys got? OB-GYN. Save my seat there, partner. Thanks. I got Redding first. Surgery. - Lucky you. - That's easy for you to say. Redding is a killer. He's the dean of third year. He's gonna bust my balls. Mike, what say we share notes again this year? You take mine, you mean? Michael! Suzanne. - Beautiful. - Forget it, Gant. - Here you go, partner. - Thanks. I'm Dr. David Redding, dean of third-year studies and Chief of Surgery. You know, every year I look out at the group assembled here, and I ask myself the same question: why would anyone knowingly do this to themselves? For the next year, your days will not end. The work will never stop. Your rank will command absolutely zero respect. And, worst of all, after it's over, you will be faced with the horrible realization that there is nothing in your medical career that will ever be as rewarding as third year. Third year is like being an 18-year-old rookie and being called on to pitch the seventh game of the world series... blindfolded. Doesn't get any tougher. Just remember though that none of you would be here if you weren't pretty good rookies to start with. Now, for survival purposes, you have been divided into small groups that you will stay with all year through each of your rotations. The very best in each specialty will be selected to enter residency in that area. There are three internships in Pediatrics, two for OB-GYN, two for Internal Medicine, and one and only one for Surgery. That's my little neck of the woods. Your future will depend on how many honor grades you accumulate during the course of the year and whether or not you honor in your specialty. - Size. - I know that's very important to you. For me, the only thing that really matters is making you into the best doctors possible. Because it is hands-on from this moment on, people, for the rest of your professional days. Well, doesn't everybody look official? I'm Bobby. I'm Dr. Redding's physician's aide. It's my job to show you people how little you really know. And... I love my job. Every morning, you will be at the hospital an hour before the doctors to check on your patients' primary care. Then the entire team with your resident will make the rounds. - During these sessions, you will be pimped. - Pimped? Pimped... questioned, probed and humiliated by the residents... for interpretations, diagnoses, complications. Cases that are really juicy will be reviewed in grand rounds, which is the same as regular rounds except that everybody in the house is there. If you intend to make Honors, you'd better know your shit on grand rounds. I've been in this place a long time, and I've never seen anyone screw up grand rounds and come out with Honors. Nobody. Daily summaries are on green paper, permanent summaries are on red paper. Please observe the following demonstration closely. Unlabeled blood specimens received in the specimen receiving room... will be processed as follows. Nurses... heads, R.N.s, L.V.N.s, nurse's aides... It is easy to confuse them. Don't. Hi. - Hi. - Talking's allowed. I'm glad you're enjoying the privilege. Seeing as how we didn't do too much of it our first two years, I thought now that we're in the same group, we could make up for lost time. Michael, you've convinced me. You're very charming. - Thank you. - But I'm afraid you've got it. - Got what? - Surgeon's ego. - What is it? A disease? What? - You look to be a classic case. - Your personality already fits the prototype. - And what's that? As a group, they're narcissistic, insensitive, chauvinistic, and their only definition of success is to win at all costs. I'm Dr. Margaret Kennan, chief resident of OB-GYN. You will begin the first of your rotations in my domain. The patient is a 23-year-old gravida 1, para 0, ab-0, 40 weeks gestation, noted one week ago to have frank breech presentation. External versions attempted two times failed, so she's been admitted for elective C-section. - Buenos días, señora. - Ola. Dr. Hayes, why is this patient having a C-section? Well... If she were well, Dr. Hayes, she wouldn't be here. Dr. Wyler? Because the external version failed. Delivering a breech presentation might expose the baby to unnecessary injury. And what injuries are those? Dr. Rose? Nerve damage, prolapsed cord and delay in delivery of the head. What about the possible problems with doing a C-section? Dr. Chatham? Aspiration from anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism. Good. - I knew that. - Some help here! Dr. Kennan! Seventh baby. Got hung up in Admitting. - She's not gonna make it to delivery. - Okay. Get over here! Hold her up for me. I want you to breathe. Just breathe. Now, push. Push! Big push. Big push. Yeah! Don't stop. Breathe in. Breathe in. Here it comes. Big push. Hey! Yeah! Yeah! Good girl. Relax. You have a beautiful, perfect, little baby boy. Wow! - A baby. - You're here, people. Is it too late for law school? All right. Kenny's patient, Mrs. Thompkins. Twenty-three weeks gestation noted. Hayes? - Top left. - Is admitted for strong labor pains. Don't! Hayes! Be careful not to touch anything. It's a lab experiment. That you've been growing for two years. Use mine, Gina. So, now, what if the ultrasound shows abruption? Then the bleeding will probably stop. Okay. But what happens when she begins contractions? Do an amnio on her. Determine the baby's age in case she needs a section. There's no need to do a tap on her this soon. Why don't you just try to stop labor and see if you can carry her for a few weeks? - No way. You're wrong. - No, I'm right. If it was an abruption, the odds are that the bleeding will stop. And if you can stop her labor, she'll probably go to term. I mean, there's no need to risk a tap right away. You're right. - What are you drinking? - Herbal tea. It's from Pakistan. You can probably smell it in Pakistan. It doesn't bother Hayes. Yeah, my olfactory cells were destroyed when we first started rooming together. What do you guys do when, you know, one of you brings home a date? What's a date? In med school? When was the last time I had a date, Hayes? I believe the year was 1922. Woody Wilson had just taken office, and... - Come on in. It's open. - Hi. - Lauren. I thought I was gonna call you. I thought you were too. Everybody, this is my wife. -Lauren. Um, you know Gina. -Hi. - Hi. - This is Michael. - Hi. - And Suzanne. - Hi. - And Hayes. - How do? - Hey. - You didn't change. - No, I just got off work. What... Jesus. Look what time it is. - Where do you work? - She works in a restaurant. If you want, I can come back over when you're done. No way. You kidding? We're out of here. - Um, in the morning. - Bye. Well, I think I'll be going too. Bye, you guys. Nice meeting you. Bye. Bye, Gina. So, how was your first day at school? Did you play nice with the other kids? I figure there's five guys seriously in contention for the internship. Chatham's the one. The other guys I'm not so worried about. Kenny, I've known you since you were 12. You've gotten everything you've wanted, including me. Well, you were easy. How's the restaurant biz? Let me put it this way. Get your M.D. fast, and get me out of there! - Hi. - Hi. Need a ride? No, somebody's gonna pick me up. It's late. Why don't you come in and wait with me? My house is right there. Michael, I was raised on a military base. I know how to take care of myself. This place is a little more like the front lines at night, if you know what I mean. I'll just wait out here with you. That's a very nice gesture, and I appreciate it, but, thanks, no. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Look, I'm sorry. I won't stay out here. Just do me a favor, will ya? Hold on to this for protection. I don't need this, Michael. No, it's not for you. It's for me. You think anybody's gonna attack my house with you standing in the street holding this thing? That was nice of you to come out. Thank you for waiting with me. It's... Hey. Batting practice? See you later. - Good morning. - Good morning, Dr. Rose. So were you able to sleep through the night? Great. Your blood pressure looks good. We'll do an ultrasound next Tuesday. You seem to be doing pretty well. - Gina. - I'm late. - Hi. - Hi. - Late night? - Yeah. Gina, who is this guy? His name is Donald Ballentine. He's Redding's surgery resident. No kidding? This may be none of my business, but... is it serious? - Would it matter to you if it was? - No. I didn't think so. - Our first baby. - It was incredible. I'm so proud. After what we just saw in there, I'm not so sure I want children. - I do, definitely. - A little Dr. Ballentine? On second thought. Sometimes, he's great. He takes this surgeon-messiah thing a little too far. I mean, the sex is good, but I don't think it's worth it. No. It's worth it. Trust one who hasn't had it in a while. - What, nothing? - Well, who has time to meet anybody with this job? - Single guy alert. - Ladies. Blue is definitely your color. I need a man, not sleaze. - What about Hayes? - Hayes? Hayes is like my brother. It would be like committing a-a crime. But I always thought you'd be great together. - Well, we are as roommates. Anyway, he's not my type. - What is your type? Well, you know. The kind of guy you meet, sleep with immediately, carry on a horrible relationship with for two or three months while they make you feel really shitty about yourself, then break up with and never speak to again. - I know that type. - Yeah. Bye. Bye. - Dr. Chatham. - Rose. Thanks, Larry. You shootin' for the surgery internship? Thinkin' about it. You? Thinking about it. I guess we're both thinking about it. - You know the guy? - Redding? No. Never met him. Thought you would have, your father bein' a surgeon and all. What, because my father should know him, I-I would know him? Yeah. Ain't that the way it goes? Chatham? Order's up. Thanks, Larry. Breathe. That's it. Come on, now. Breathe. Breathe. - How long has it been? - Sixteen hours. Sixteen hours? Prepare for a C-section. - No! - Sir, can't we give it a little longer? It could take five more hours for that baby to come down, and I've got 10 more like her waiting. - Prepare for a "C." - I'll wait with her. How many of these have you done? Including this one? One. - Your first. - Yeah. Only a third-year would offer to do this. So, wait with her. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Breathe. - Hey! - Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - I never thought we'd have a date in the lobby of a hospital. We had this amazing triple aneurysm. We tried to lock him off above the knee, but we couldn't get it. So we had to go in through the other side. It was amazing. It's... It's hard to explain. I delivered my first baby today. - Really? - Yeah. That's-that's-that's great. It must be exciting? It was a little scary, to tell you the truth. You'll get used to it. You'll be able to do it in your sleep. God, I remember OB-GYN, and I thought it was tough. Now it's like a walk in the park. It didn't seem like a walk in the park to me. No, you'll get used to it. I promise. I gotta get back up there. This was great. It's the cheapest date we ever had. Doctor. Give me Miss Wilson's chart in 1217, please. Thank you. - Gina. - Hi. Hi. How'd it go today? Good. Really good. How's Rita? Did she ever deliver? Yeah. A boy... for 23 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds. Voom! She's out like a light. And I'm a wreck. when I was a little girl, I used to always dream about becoming a doctor... and doing something like delivering a baby. Now you're here doin' it. - Yeah. - It's kind of incredible, isn't it? Congratulations on your first delivery, Dr. Wyler. Thank you. You too. Thanks. See ya. See ya. Lauren, hey. Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't call. I couldn't find any time. Hey. Hey, say something. Come on. I can't stand it when you don't say anything. I've been in a four-hour delivery. I couldn't get a break to take a piss, much less give you a call. I'm sorry. Me too. How was your day? Paging Dr. Rose, Dr. Kenneth Rose. Well, that's good. Look... Look, I gotta go. Yeah, I know. I'll call, I promise. I... promise. Yeah. Yeah, bye. A gift from Redding, people. A list of 30 emergency drugs. Know them by Friday. - When's Friday? - In about eight hours. Maybe you'll absorb it by osmosis. - Who's up? - I am. - Me too. - E.R., stat. - Where's the stomach puncture? - This one here. Prep. Come on, you two. Come on over here and help me. Dr. Rose, start an I.V. and hang a unit of plasma. Dr. Chapman, I need four red tops. Damn. What did they use on this guy, a machete? Chatham, how do we know if we need to send this patient to the O.R.? - Peritoneal lavage, sir. - That's right. Okay, let's set up a peritoneal lavage. Can I have the otoscope, please? So, Rose, I understand you're from Chicago. Yes, sir. My folks still live there. What am I looking for here, Rose? - Blood behind the eardrum. Possible skull fracture. - Right. Can we drape him, please? Rose, I need you to infiltrate with Xylocaine. What do they do... your folks? My father's in the restaurant supply business. Scalpel. - Chatham, make a small incision there. - Yes, sir. Retractor. Rose, hold this retractor, please. Keep your eyes on it. So why didn't you get into the family business? I always wanted to be a doctor, sir. Yeah. Feed this tube in here, Chatham. So what about you, Chatham? You wanna be a doctor like your old man? Sir, when I was six, I actually thought about becoming one of The Temptations. Really? You didn't pursue it, then? No, sir. The position's filled. Keep your eyes on this tube, please. - What made you decide to become a doctor? - Helplessness, I guess. I'd been marching with some farm workers in Florida. I'd been talking to this guy. All of a sudden, he drops in front of me with a heart attack. There I was. I was trying to save the ills of the world, and I couldn't even save a guy who was dying in front of me. What do you got in that tube there, Chatham? Clear solution, sir, indicating no internal bleeding in the patient. Good. All right. Let's stitch him up. Gentlemen, you know, I think you're both very promising doctors. I want you to remember something. Who we are and where we come from, it's really good for chitchat. But in my program, the only thing that really matters is how good you are. All right. Finish up here. Chatham. Kenny! Hi. What's wrong? Are you okay? Chatham got the Honors in OB-GYN. Sweetie. Well, why didn't you come inside? How long have you been out here? - I don't know. - Come on. You'll make Honors next rotation. Okay? I can't let this guy beat me. Not now. I've come too far. - Good night, Lauren. - Good night. George, Nell. I want you to meet Kenny, my husband. These are the people I was tellin' you about that make this place bearable every night. You're the reason Lauren has to work in this joint? - You got a girl with a heart of gold. - Lucky guy. Come on. Good night. Kenny? It's no big deal. Yeah. I gotta go home. I gotta study. A full day off. I can think of about a million things I wanna do. - What do you think of? - Women. Really? That's fascinating. "Really? That's fascinating." What? You asked me, I told you. Will you go get my tofu? Tofu? No, I don't want... That stuff looks like-like... Like tofu. Go get it. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be back in a few minutes. So I'm all ready to do an open-heart on this guy. And then I look at his chart, and he's here to get a cleaning and flossing. I don't know. I tell ya, I can't get no respect. Guy walks into a doctor's office. The doctor says, "I've got some bad news..." - How are ya? - Good. - How are you? - Real good. Nice to see you. - You too. - Well, everything's set. We've agreed to renew the same student loan option that you've had for the last two years. Full tuition. So if you'll just sign right there and there. Sure. May I ask you a personal question, Mr. Chatham? I know your father's a doctor. These loans are gonna weigh on you for a good 10, 15 years of your career. Why don't I just get my dad to pay for it? We don't have that kind of relationship. It doesn't work that way. There's something about a hospital serving liver. Suzanne, baby, I am desperate. I need your notes on OB "D" and "C." "Kennan"? Gant, you're picking up your resident's laundry? - Well, she asked me for a favor. She's a little busy. - "Please, Dr. Kennan. God, please let me do you a favor and pick up your laundry!" Come on, guys. Give me a break. I'm not that bad. - Give me a chili dog, will you? - Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Gant, you got anything in there for me? No, sir. But if you'd like me to pick anything up or go get anything... No, no. I'm... I'm just kidding. All right, George, don't shit me now. Is this liver on the up and up here, or do I go for the regular? Happy Thanksgiving. - Dr. Chatham? - Yes, sir? Henrietta Walker. Interesting case? Yes, sir. Cancer patient. I'm gonna put her on grand rounds for Monday. Hello, Mrs. Walker. I'm Dr. Michael Chatham, your student doctor. Just wanted to come introduce myself. I've had some blood work ordered. A nurse will come up here shortly and take some samples. It might hurt for a moment, but it'll go away. I see you're a... an elementary school teacher. What grade? Mr. Chatham, I realize this is a teaching hospital. But since I do not want you practicing dramatics at my bedside, please drop this transparent act of the concerned doctor. You will find this infinitely easier on both of us... if you'll concentrate on being direct, accurate and to the point. I know what I have, and I know why I'm here. I don't need hand-holding. Is that understood? Yes. Yes. Drink. Hayes. Thanks, buddy. Listen, why don't you take a break in about an hour? We'll grab some dinner. You gotta eat, or you're gonna be worthless for grand rounds tomorrow. I can't, man. I gotta check on Miss Walker in an hour. - I'll get something later. - Yeah, that's what I thought you'd say. So, from Suzanne. - Tell her I said thanks. - Yeah. Gina's contribution. I think you're makin' real headway with that girl. Get outta here. - Are you gonna eat that sandwich? - Yeah. - Just checking. - Right. - Any time, Dr. Chatham. - Yes, sir. The patient, Miss Henrietta Walker, is a 49-year-old female, presents with sharp, epigastric pain, nausea, although no vomiting. - This has been increasing in the last three months. - Physical findings? Distended abdomen with diffused tenderness, shifting dullness, and a fluid wave sign indicating ascites. - What workup was done? - CAT scan shows a mass in the area of the stomach. Endoscopy and biopsy test positive for gastric carcinoma. Well, what's your assessment, Dr. Chatham? A large gastric carcinoma with possible spread to the greater omentum. All right. She's your patient. How would you treat her? - Give her several courses of chemotherapy. - What else? - Wait for significant improvement and attempt surgery. - All right. Let's take a look at the patient. - Henrietta. - Dr. Redding. I have some friends with me here. Let's take a look. Tell me if I push too hard. Don't worry. I won't hesitate. I'm sure you won't. How are the cats? Splendid. Any new additions? None since the Siamese. I've decided it's time to put my house in order... in case I don't come home this time. That's an admirable thought, but one I think you could put off... for the immediate future. All right. Well, I think Dr. Chatham's assessment's on the money. Questions? I have a question, sir. - Yes? - Dr. Chatham, what if there's intestinal blockage secondary to metastasis? Tests haven't revealed that. What tests? CAT scan, liver and bone scan, L.F.T.s, SMA-12. Those wouldn't necessarily reveal intestinal obstruction... or possible pleural effusion, which, from your presentation, could be included in this assessment. That's a good point, Dr. Rose. All right, let's order an upper G.I. series for Mrs. Walker. Thank you, Henrietta. Doctors. Are you all right? I was expecting to be attacked, but not by someone in my own group. Well, Kenny's a fighter. He's probably had to fight all of his life. You know, it's funny. When Kenny's a tough-ass competitor, everybody says, "It's all right. It's okay. Look where he's come from. He's had it tough. So what if he's an asshole about it?" Gina, if I had pulled a stunt like he did today in there, I'd have been crucified for it. Why? Because your father's a surgeon? -Michael... -Look, it doesn't matter, okay? It's not important. All that matters are end results. Who's the best. I don't like to lose. Kenny may have fired the first shot, but I'm gonna win this war. Michael. The tests suggested by Dr. Rose have all been run on the patient. All prove negative, thus supporting my initial assessment... that the patient, Miss Henrietta Walker, begin a prescribed chemotherapy regime beginning in two weeks... continuing for six concurrent weeks. Thank you, Dr. Chatham. Good follow-up. Questions? Finish up with your patient, Dr. Chatham, - and then meet up with us in rounds. - Yes, sir. Well, I think... that is what is referred to as a hollow victory. I'm sorry. I guess sometimes we get carried away. It's the competition. It... I'm sorry. No need to apologize. It's entertaining. You know, I could have gone to a private hospital. Pension and disability are pretty generous when you've been a teacher for 25 years. I chose to be here. - Why? - Because this is a teaching hospital. And being a teacher, I relate to the process going on around me. It... It makes me feel less sick, like I'm back in my classroom. So how am I doing, Teach? You're doing pretty well, Dr. Chatham. Just don't concentrate so much on the facts. Facts are pretty important around here. So are people, Doctor. ♪ Open the door get on the floor ♪ ♪ Everybody walk the dinosaur ♪ ♪ Open the door get on the floor ♪ ♪ Everybody walk the dinosaur ♪ ♪ Open the door get on the floor ♪ ♪ Everybody walk the dinosaur ♪ Michael, Michael, Michael.

Then it turns out the guy has a mediastinal mass obstructing the vena cava. I mean, you wouldn't believe the size of this thing. Humongous. Incredible. Are you going for Surgery too, Gina? No, um, Pediatrics or Medicine. I haven't decided yet. There aren't a lot of women surgeons. Why? Yes, why is that, Donald? Seems kind of obvious. Surgery takes a lot of dedication. It's not the kind of thing you do for a couple of hours and then go home and be with the kids. And, besides, the things we talk about in there... tough for a woman to take. I see. You'd have to clean up your locker-room talk. That's bullshit. What's the problem here? You're not even interested in surgery. Well, lucky for me that I'm not. Excuse me. Bye. - Hey, where are you goin'? - Home. Lauren, it's not your fault. You didn't know any better. Come on. - Come on. It's okay. They're our friends. - No, they're your friends. If I'd asked you to come spend tonight with my friends, you would've said no. Hey, these people are where our life is. Where your life is, not mine. I'm tired. I'd like to go. I'm stayin'.

Have a nice holiday. Hayes. Good morning. Good morning. - God! - What time is it? - 6:30. - 6:30?! Listen, can I, take the top one? I'll bring it right back. - Yeah. - You're sure you don't mind? - No. - Good. I'm gonna use my bathroom. It's got all my stuff. Okay. My God! What have I done? My God. Well, Hayes. You have done it this time. - Hi. - How are ya? I'm great. I'm just... I'm great. And how are you? Great, great. I'm great too. Me, I'm great. Thanks for asking. See ya. What's goin' on, Hayes? Okay, Hayes, you wanna tell me what's goin' on here? Me and Suzanne... We did the wild thing. You slept with Suzanne? I thought you guys were just friends. We are. We... Well, we were. Now I'm not so sure. - Well, have you talked to her about it? - Not exactly, no. - Hayes, you've gotta talk to her. - I know. I know. All right, look, don't be stupid. This could be the greatest thing that ever happened to your relationship. Okay, maybe not. How... How was it? Well, that's the problem. See, it-it was really good, but it wasn't great. - How about for Suzanne? - That's the worst of it. See, for Suzanne, I think it was, unbelievable. It was okay. How was it for Hayes? He thought it was incredible. - Why are you here? - I came to check up on things. Haven't you graduated, or whatever they call it, from this rotation? You don't exactly graduate. But, yeah, I'm in Pediatrics now. I just came down to make sure you weren't scaring anyone. You seem to be doing better. Your weight looks good. Why don't you ask me if I am doing better? Or is that taboo? I'm sorry. How do you feel you're doing with the treatment? Fine. Thank you. Good. The important thing is for you to ask. Now, how is your competition progressing? Fine, I guess. - Don't you know? - I just didn't know you were interested. I simply like to know that whoever's working on me is competent. That's all. Good morning, Dr. Chatham. Dr. Redding. - How are we looking there, Dr. Ballentine? - All set, Doctor. - All set to go? - Yes, sir. - We're ready, Dr. Chatham. - We'll go in between the fifth and sixth ribs. - Give me a scalpel, please. - Scalpel. - I need the rib spreader. - Rib spreader. - Sponge. - Sponge. - Have a little bleeding present. Cautery. - Cautery. Mayo scissors. Dr. Chatham, it was great working with you. - It's a pleasure working with you. - Thanks. Good to meet you. So you're doing well here? Honoring? Well, so far in everything but Medicine. There's some stiff competition. You're in one of the best med schools in the nation. What'd you expect? I remember when you were in the national 14-and-under tennis finals. You breezed through the first four rounds without dropping a set. Then you came up against that kid, Gomez. - You remember? - Yeah. He beat you the first set, and then you let down. You were better. You were much better than he was. But when you let down, he took advantage of you and he beat you three straight sets. Afterwards, I never saw you drop your guard again. Don't do it now. That was 10 years ago. How'd you remember that kid's name? It was a pivotal moment. You always remember the pivotal moments. - Good to see you, Son. - You too, Dad. - Draft, please. - Sure. Hi. Mind if I sit? Meeting someone? - No. - Sure. - Here you go. - Thanks. Sure. Why is it that when a guy comes into a bar to be alone with his drink, no one thinks twice about it? But when a woman comes in alone, everyone assumes she's waiting to be picked up? - Why is that? - I have no idea. You know, your father really is a terrific surgeon. I guess you've heard that a million times. Yeah. About a million and one. You know, I was eight years old before I found out his first name wasn't "Doctor." All the time that he lived at home, I used to go to the hospital and make rounds with him. I loved the way people there treated him. They... Like he was royalty, you know? "Dr. Chatham, we need you for this. Dr. Chatham, we need you for that." It wasn't long before I realized those people knew him better than I did. And I wanted to be just like him and as good as him. I mean, so that he would talk to me too. What gets me worse than anything, even now, like today when I see him... Yeah. I feel exactly like I felt when I was eight years old. I'm still trying. I'll leave you by yourself. What do you recommend, Dr. Hayes? Well, given the little girl's allergy to penicillin, I recommend we start her on erythromycin. - Sounds good. - Here you go, sweetheart. We'll have you feelin' better in a flash. Bye-bye. Thank you, Doctor. Be well. For your cough, all you need to do is when you go home, grind up about seven or eight peppercorns and mix it with some honey. It'll take care of your throat. - Really? - Yeah. - I'll try it. - Okay. Peppercorns and honey? Is that some new combination they taught you in pharmacology? Well, I... -What do you suggest after that? Eye of newt? Three eagle feathers? Jump up three times and bark at the moon? It's sort of a secret family recipe, actually. Well, I suggest that you keep it just that, Dr. Maloney... a secret. You see, when a patient receives information from you, they perceive it as coming from a doctor. And you are not a doctor. What specialty are you heading for? Well, I was hoping Pediatrics. Good luck. ♪ Let me tell you about the stars in the sky ♪ ♪ And a girl and a guy ♪ - ♪ And the way they kiss ♪ - Hayes? - ♪ On a night like this ♪ - Hi. - Do you need some help? - No, no. I've got it all under control. Boy. Um... So they brought this guy up from Psych for X-ray. A swallower. Pencils, pennies... you name it, he'd eat it. Unfortunately, nobody bothered to tell me that. What I got is that this guy's ready for release. - No, Hayes. - Yeah. - He had the form and everything. - You didn't release him? No, no, no, no. He ate my pen before I got the chance to sign the form. I'm sorry. I'm really tired. - Maybe we should just go to sleep. - Okay, you're right. - Good night. - Good night. - Are you comfortable? - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Hey, Billy, your blood is tired. We're gonna give you a transfusion to make you feel stronger. Will it hurt? Well, it might sting a little when I first put in the needle, but I'm pretty good at it. After that, it won't hurt a bit. Okay, relax. Dr. Kelly said to go ahead. The tests are fine. Great. A little alcohol. It feels cold. All right. Now, that didn't hurt a bit, did it? Okay. There you go. - Want me to connect the tubing? - Yeah, I'll take it. There you go. Now just relax. Take a deep breath. That's good. What's happening? My God! Get help! Get some help in here! Suzanne, go get some help! Code blue! We need some help here, stat! Dr. Redding, 213! Get his head up! What's happening? - What happened? - Convulsions. I don't know what happened. All right. Let me get in here. Come on. There's no pulse. All right. He's coding. Get the cart in here. Come on. We need to get him intubated. Let's get that monitor on. Get the board under him. Lift him up. All right. I'm starting compressions. Ambu-bag. One amp bicarb, one amp epi. Can I see a rhythm strip? Was there any seizure disorder on the chart? No, none. - How long has he been like this? - Two minutes. - What was his diagnosis? - Anemia. All right. Let's get ready. All right. We're charged here. Ready for defib. Stand back. There's no response. Again. Stand back. Nothing. All right. I'm going manual. There's nothing on the monitor. We're losing him. Bretylium. Isuprel. All right. Let's defib him again. All right. We're going again. Stand back. We're losing him here. Come on, kid. Come on. - Come on. - Damn it! Come on, kid. Come on. Stand back. still nothing. I'm gonna go back to manual massage. come on. Come on. We're not gonna lose you here. Come on. We lost him. - Time? - 11:58. No, I already left a message. Look, when does Dr. Ballentine get out of surgery? He already got out? Great. When did he get out, please? All right. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Come on in. - Why don't you come out? Is this really out here every day? Nah. Only when we're working. Go ahead. Say it. Get it over with. You don't think it was my fault... what happened in there today. Gina, come on. For every 10 things you can test for, there's 100 that you can't. He was my patient. Gina, there probably isn't a doctor alive who hasn't felt responsible for a patient's death. I mean, you do something, and in spite of all your best knowledge, it goes wrong. It's not your fault. Don't beat yourself up for it. I don't know if I can go back in there. I don't know if I'm strong enough to go back in there. You are. I know you are. I don't know if I'm strong enough. You are. What are you doing here? I got two urgent messages. I thought there was something wrong. I guess I made a mistake. If you were so worried, why didn't you call right back when you got the messages? I don't call you right back, so then you run off with the next best thing? Come on, Gina. God. Donald, you are a terrific surgeon. But what I need right now is somebody who cares about the way I feel, and you're just not good at it. I'm sorry. Shit. This is surgery, folks, not a picnic. Get 'em clean. Your hands, Dr. Hayes. - Go ahead. - No, you, please. No, really. You were first. Hi. - You gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be all right. Congratulations on Honors in Pediatrics. Way to go. You too. Double Honors. Makes this the big showdown. Good luck. ♪ Rescue me, take me in your arms ♪ - - ♪ Rescue me ♪ - ♪ Rescue me ♪ ♪ I want your tender charm ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, the surgery rotation. ♪ I need you and your love too ♪ - Come on. I know you've all been waiting for this. - Sal, you wanna get that? - ♪ Come on, baby ♪ ♪ And rescue me ♪ All right, now, people. Now, the tension is so thick in here that I don't know whether to cut it or the patient. Can we just concentrate on the operation? Thank you. All right. Now, today, we have a simple cholecystectomy. If we don't traumatize the surrounding tissue here, we can have this patient going home in a couple days. You ready, Dr. Ballentine? - Let's do it. - Okay, scalpel. Dr. Wyler, I'd like you to perform the honors. Now, if you can just make an incision from here to here. Okay. From here to here? Okay. That's okay. It's all right. I'll take it. All right. The incision is made here in the midline from here. At least he had the decency to wind up on the floor. - Vivian? - Yes? - Hi. - Lauren, hi. - Hi, Lauren. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I got off early. I thought I'd bring something. We could have dinner together. Is that okay? I don't have time to take a break. - Not even to eat? - I grabbed something earlier. I asked you if it would be okay if I stopped by, and you said it would be. Yeah. I thought it was gonna be later. Yeah, well, it can't be later, 'cause I'm working a shift tonight. You know that. - I don't remember what shift you're working on. - Lucky you remember anything. - Goddamn it, I'm working. - What do you think I'm doing every day and night? All I want is 10 minutes with my husband that I never see. - I think we're gonna take a little walk. - No. I'm sorry. Don't go. No, it's okay. There's things that we need to do. - It's okay. - It's fine. Dr. Rose, what if we were to come in under the bed of the ninth rib instead of the 11th? - Suction. - We would risk traumatizing the pleural space, possibly resulting in a pneumothorax. What other approach could we use? Hayes? Well, the patient has a very large tumor, and the added exposure by going in through the ninth rib would lead me... - Hang in there, Hayes. - Come on, buddy. Hang in there. I'm fine. I'm fine. It would lead me to... use that approach. I think you're right. Are we all in agreement? - Pressure looks good. - Two-silk. - Suture. - Dr. Chatham, what if the patient were to spike tonight in post-op and develop a distended abdomen? - Clamp. - Worry about intra-abdominal bleeding, check for sepsis. What kind of workup would you do? Complete C.B.C. Look for an increase in white count. Get a blood culture, urine culture, chest X-ray. - More suction, please. - Very good. - Hemostat and sponge. - Cut. Damn! Vivian. Hayes? How are you feeling? I feel like we gotta get out of this rotation soon or I'm gonna end up on that table myself. - Redding thinks I'm an idiot. - No, Redding thinks it's hilarious. You know, this is the longest conversation that we've had in weeks. You're my best friend, Hayes. I miss that. Having sex shouldn't interfere with our friendship. - But... - It has. - I miss my couch. - I want my room back. You got it. - Suz? - Yeah? It was nice though, wasn't it? Yeah, I'm telling all my friends. So where'd you learn that technique of pulling up through the bottom? - Redding showed it to me. - Yeah? The first time I've tried it though. - Pretty impressive. - Thanks. Chatham, Ballentine wants you. Ballentine. - Is this your patient? - Yes, sir. - What's his condition? - He's just been admitted for a workup for an enlarged liver, a coin lesion to the lung, needs an upper G.I. Well, instead of disappearing into the student lounge, maybe you better start his workup... E.K.G, lytes, chem panel, urine for culture, stool for occult blood. Order an upper G.I., B.E. and a CAT scan. Get the results to me stat. You understand? - Yes, sir. - Good. Rick, I need these right away. - You need these now? - Yeah, now. Rick. Buddy. Pal. Putz. Rick? Rick! - Cynthia, where's Dr. Ballentine? - He's off all day. What do you mean, "off"? Have those two workups run tomorrow, and we'll put 'em on the schedule for next week. - Chatham. - Sir, sorry I'm late. I was delayed in lab. We were talking a bit about abdominal masses. Someone can fill you in. Good luck with that, Dr. Rose. Thank you, sir. - What's up? - Another case came in. It's a renal cell carcinoma. They're gonna try to operate. - Redding's gonna let Kenny scrub with him? - Yeah. That's great. I mean, that's great. That's great. - Your patient's in room 218. - Thanks, Suz. X-rays go pretty fast. Just couldn't stay away? If you find that entrance line humorous or calming, we have a major problem. Well, you'll like this one better. The chemo's worked. We shrunk the tumor. What does Dr. Redding say? He's got you ordered for surgery in a week. He's also ordered you a new diet and some supplemental fluids to get you up to fighting strength. He thinks I'm too weak to make it through the operation. No, it's mainly to help you after the operation. I told you before I'd have none of that. - Of what? - Bedside lying. Miss Walker, you're going to be just fine. That's better. I almost believed you. Now get some rest. - Don't I know you from somewhere? - Hey, stranger. - Hi. - Hi. Wait. Wait. He's got his operation tomorrow. Wait. Michael. Come on. - Where? - Let's go. What? Where are we going? Michael. My God. Tie this vessel right here and... cut this. Scissors. Cut. What do we have to watch for here, Rose? Superior mesenteric artery. Cut right here. Scissors. Okay. It's completely encased the aorta. We can't get it out without compromising the intestinal blood supply. Well, what did the pre-op I.V.P. show? The mass didn't cross the midline. All right. We're out of here. Isn't there something we can do? You know, Dr. Rose, sometimes you have to know when to quit... and hope to come back to fight another day. Maybe after some chemo, we can come back in here, but... Close him. Two layers of nylon, please. Shit. Go ahead, man. Close him up. Suture. Pick-ups. How ya doin'? Look, there's no way you can test for that. - It's not your fault. - Come on. - What do you care? - What are you talking about? I could have tested for it. - I should've thought of an angiogram. - Next time. What do you mean, "next time"? You've got it wrapped up, Chatham. I'm gonna stay at Nell's. I left the number on the table. - For how long? - I don't know. A while. I just gotta get through this year on top. You knew that this would be hard. I knew you'd have to work. I didn't know you'd have to resent me. I don't resent you. I... Kenny, every time you walk in here and I'm waiting for you, you resent me. Every time I call you, you resent me. Every time we go out with your friends and I don't have anything to say... Forget it. You don't hear, and I can take that. What I can't take is how this goddamn competition has changed you. You haven't made me a part of things. The patient's weight is 120 pounds, hemoglobin is up to 10.7. However, future weight gain will not be as dramatic... falling off by 20 percent... Therefore offsetting any advantage that we may gain by delaying the operation. Very good. Dr. Ballentine and I are gonna do our little work in the O.R. so we can get you out of here. Well, it's about time everyone stopped talking and did something. I agree. Dr. Ballentine is gonna be performing the surgery, and I've also asked Dr. Chatham to scrub so he can assist. So we'll all be seeing you in the O.R. Okay? Spirits up. - Are you nervous? - No. That was good. I am scared. don't be. There's no reason to be scared. Everyone here is the best. You don't need to worry about it. I promise. - Okay? - Okay. I promise. Okay. - Tie that blood vessel there. - Debakey pick-ups. - Suction. - Clamp. Chatham, what would you do next? - Go through the omentum to the lesser sac, sir. - Right. Dr. Ballentine, why don't you let Dr. Chatham work in here for a little while? Come on, Chatham. - Metzenbaums. - Metzenbaums. - Hemostat. - Hemostat. So what's the game plan? Connect the esophagus to the jejunum. And how do you plan to drain this? With a long N.G. tube and multiple drains. Let's get all the packs out of here and take a sponge count. - Don't wanna leave anything in there. - Yes, sir. Can you wrap up here? I got a plane to catch. All right. Thanks very much, people. You've been great. - Dr. Chatham? - Yes, sir. - You did real good in there. - Thank you, sir. Why don't you close up shop for us? Yes, sir. Dr. Chatham, report to post-op. Dr. Michael Chatham to post-op. Sarah, how's she doing? I checked her last 20 minutes ago. There's definitely a dip. - Dr. Ballentine leave any instructions? - No. Thank you. Dr. Ballentine. Sir. Dr. Ballentine. - What? - Henrietta Walker's condition is getting worse. Her blood pressure's dropping, her pulse is thready, and her urine output is very low, sir. That's just third spacing after abdominal surgery. It happens all the time. Sir, I know about third spacing. I think this may be cardiac. Dr. Ballentine, report to E.R., stat. Dr. Ballentine to E.R., stat. Just increase her fluids and keep an eye on her. Sir, I was thinking. What about adding dopamine? - If we did, it would increase her... - Chatham, you think too much. Just increase her fluids. How is she doing? B.P.'s way down, and urine output's almost at 0. What are you gonna do? Dr. Ballentine? Excuse me. I need to talk to you about Miss Walker. - I can't right now. - Sir, she's not responding. - We have to do something. - Do what? She's not dehydrated, sir. She's in cardiogenic shock. She needs some dopamine to increase her cardiac output. Sir, I learned about this in Medicine... Look, every third-year student thinks their patient has what they just learned about. She'll respond to the fluids. I'll get up there as soon as I can. - When's that? When she codes? - Get the hell out of here. Look, the best thing you can do is just let it go and hope for the best. - Did you try Redding? - No, I can't reach him. - He's on a plane somewhere. - You're stuck, man. It's Ballentine's patient. He's the doctor. - Chances are he's right. - What if he's not? You can't buck protocol. They'll kick you out. You'll lose the internship, everything. Go home. You're beat. There's nothing more you can do. Stat. Waiting on a co-signature. Do you have any idea of the seriousness of what you've done? Yes, sir. Broke protocol. You cut yourself off from the hospital. You challenged and overruled a resident of mine whose experience outweighs you by quite a few years. Sir, it was clear Miss Walker was not responding as expected to the medication. Her readouts were extremely low. - I had to do something. - No, Dr. Chatham. Dr. Ballentine had to do something. He was also aware of the factors affecting her condition, and it was his studied opinion to continue the medication as planned. Sir, he was not aware. Well, then it's your responsibility to make him aware. At the moment, I thought the patient's life was more important than the rules, sir. - What would you have done? - That's not the point. I cannot run a program where a student is allowed to act on his own, no matter how good his intentions are. I would rather accept the responsibility of breaking the rules than losing a patient's life, sir. And if your choice had proved to be incorrect, would you have been prepared to accept the responsibility for her death? Saving someone's life does not make you infallible, Dr. Chatham. We're human. We make mistakes. I think you have the makings of a fine doctor, but you haven't even begun to experience the complications of a human body. Now, until you're able to understand the limits of your knowledge, I'm not gonna allow you to practice in this hospital. You're suspended from all duty until further notice. Yes, sir. I don't believe it. I counted it up. I spent 68 hours away from this place since we got here. That's 2.8 days. I don't know where to go. Hey, we need goblets on 16. You got it. - You doing okay? - Yeah. How's school? Chatham got suspended. - What happened? - Broke a rule. He went against Ballentine. So I guess that makes you number one. Congratulations. The day you left, I operated on this guy. We opened him up, and there was nothing we could do for him. I felt so helpless. I would have done anything to help that guy. Michael felt the same way. The thing is, he saved Ballentine's ass, but he's getting screwed for it. I don't know what's important anymore. Except... I know... that you are. Do you think you're coming home? - Dad. - Michael. - What are you doing here? - Your mother called me. I wanna know what's happened. I made a decision. That's what happened. There's a lot of people who think I did the wrong thing. I know I did the right thing. I'm prepared to accept the responsibility. Listen. When I was starting out, I wanted to believe that medicine was an exact science, but there are too many variables, too many random possibilities. I finally understood that my instinct... was as important as my knowledge... That actually my knowledge informed my instinct, and that I should trust it. It took a lot of courage to believe that. But I knew that if I turned my back on something I really believed in that I'd never be able to live with myself. If you did something because you really believed in it, you did the right thing, Son. Is your hearing tomorrow? Yeah. Come on. Let's talk about it. Dr. Chatham, the facts of this incident are pretty much on the table, except for one area... Why Dr. Ballentine didn't respond to your request for examination of Mrs. Walker. I can't speak for Dr. Ballentine, sir. Would you say that you had a close relationship with the patient... Mrs. Walker? - I knew her fairly well. - "Fairly well"? She was my patient during my medicine rotation. I've followed her progress for the past several months. And you kept up with her case even after you had moved on to a different rotation? Yes, sir. I was interested in her progress. Do you think it's possible, Doctor, that your relationship with the patient might have clouded your reasoning and caused you to be unduly alarmed? Perhaps even overemotional in your conversations with Dr. Ballentine? No, sir. That's impossible. I responded to the evidence. Michael, is there any reason that you're aware of that Dr. Ballentine didn't respond to your prompting? Dr. Ballentine is an excellent physician. He's been in this situation numerous times. Now, given that information, can you think of any reason why he should ignore your advice? No, sir, I can't. Thank you, Doctor. The board will review the information. Dr. Redding will make a final determination in a day or so. - You may go. - Thank you, sir. Dr. Redding. Hey, Rose, congratulations on the internship. It's not official yet, but it will be. Way to go. It was a pleasure working with you, sir. Dr. Redding! Dr. Rose. About Michael Chatham. I thought you should know the problem between him and Dr. Ballentine is personal. Michael's been seeing Gina Wyler. Dr. Ballentine had been dating her. Are you implying that Dr. Ballentine would jeopardize a patient because of a problem with Michael Chatham? I'm saying it's a factor... that hasn't been taken into consideration in Michael Chatham's suspension. You understand if what you're telling me has any bearing at all on his suspension, you're the one that has the most to lose by it? I guess that's why I'm here. I'm the most credible person you could hear this from. - Habit. - She's doing fine. - Gonna be released next week. - Yeah? Michael. - Hi. - Hi. - I came by, but you haven't been home. - I've been out. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you working tonight? Emergency. Listen, I think that you should know, Kenny went to see Redding about Donald. - What'd he say? - Why don't you ask him? Will you come by and visit me later? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Kenny. - How's it going? - Listen, I heard you talked to Redding. Yeah. Don't hold your breath. He wasn't knocked out by it. Why'd you do it? You got the internship wrapped up. Yeah, it looks that way. But I wanted to win it. In my mind, I didn't want an asterisk up next to my name saying, "Michael Chatham should've won this." Thanks. Thanks. Doctor, we have multiple incoming burn patients. - God, what the hell happened? - A tanker truck was rear-ended on the freeway. We've got 20 on the way. Okay, I want everyone available down to E.R., stat. Everybody on the double out here! Come on! Stat! Stat! The E.R.'s full! What do we got here? Is she alert? I got a bleeder. I'm gonna need some help here. The patient has no pulse. We got a code blue. Give me one amp epi, one amp bicarb, stat. We're gonna give you something for the pain. Just take it easy. - We're gonna get you cleaned up and out of here. - Give me the three-silk. Hayes, you all right there? Yeah. I got it. Let's go! Move it! Watch your back! - Give me a hand. - Clear. - We're gonna have to shock him. - Coming through. Get out of the way, buddy. - He's got a pneumothorax. Get the chest tube, suction. - Yes, sir. Get him prepped quick. Chatham, grab that patient and get in here. Come on, Chatham. Get that patient over there. All right. Let's get the chest tube. Hi, my name's Dr. Chatham. Let's see what we got here. Xylocaine, one percent. He's gonna make it. Okay, let's get the next one. - Hey. - Kenny. Dr. Rose, Chatham, sit down, please. Since you two are so relaxed, I'm gonna dispense with the formalities and get to the point. Chatham, as of today, your suspension has been removed. It is the decision of the board that your actions, however irresponsible, were motivated out of a set of circumstances which fall outside the protocols of the hospital. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Now, as to your futures. Dr. Rose, your request for transfer to Chicago Medical Center has been accepted. You will complete your fourth year there, and I've recommended you for the internship in Surgery. Thank you, sir. Dr. Chatham, that leaves you and me. You will finish up your fourth year here, and I've approved you for the surgery elective. I thought we'd get a jump on that internship. Yes, sir. Hey, Suz, did you check that stuff that makes the brakes work? The brake fluid? Yes, Hayes. Gas, gas. Did you check the gas? Have you got a full tank? Yes. And, you know, if I run out, I just might be able to find a gas station. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, Hayes. I mean, you're only going to Denver. It's not like you're going to Mars or something. Why do you have to go away for fourth year? Because it's a better pediatrics program for me. How am I gonna get through this without you? The same way I will, Hayes. On the telephone. Hayes, give me a shot here. You're taking that chair? - That's my favorite chair. - Here. The only reason I agreed to switch houses with you lovebirds is this chair. - No chair, no move. - Did you clean your bathroom? Well, I... You clean your bathroom, and you can have the chair. - That's what I thought. - I'll go first. - A lot of action... - Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Lauren. - Good luck in school, Michael. - You too. Kenny. - You keep Redding on his toes. - You bet. - I'm gonna miss you in the O.R., man. - Yeah, well, one day, we'll call for a specialist at our table, and you'll show up. I look forward to scrubbing with you, Dr. Rose. - Dr. Chatham. - Take care. - Have a safe drive back there. - Thanks. See ya, guys. - See ya, Michael. - See you later. - Suzanne, drive safe. - I will. Take care of yourself. Take care. - Call. See ya. - The oil! - Suzanne, check the oil! - Hey! But it could leak.
