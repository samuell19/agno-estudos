THE ARISTOCRATS That's it, perfect. Not finished yet? The Councillor of State is falling to pieces. I'll hold it. Give me your pliers. - Won't she see the cord? - She's blind as a bat! The impact will send the counterweight into the bushes. Hang me if they can find it! The shock might kill her. She loves ghost stories. Only she's never seen one! We can't let poor Aunt Mathilde die without seeing a ghost. With all the drugs she takes... If only we could make it look like they were coming out of the cellar, like in grandma's story. Those two brothers had a nerve. On the roof at night, thrusting rapiers till one of them falls... Nowadays we just throw pies at each other. That's the Republic for you. Here she comes! We nearly got copped. Nice walk, Aunt Mathilde? Yes, thanks, kids. A little hot. Where are you off to? It's time to get ready! We'll be right back, Aunt Mathilde! OK, we can go. Damned thing! Still a lousy rider, Philippe. You look like Uncle Barfeuil. At least he rides. It's my first time for four years. Along time. Yes, a long time without seeing you. I wanted to ask you... Go ahead. Would... No, we don't have time. Can't be late for dinner! I'll say! Come on, Amise. Did you hear the bell? Bell? You must be right. Dinner. What a shame. Will Philippe have asked him? He promised to. He came from Paris specially. Will my father...? You tell me, Daisy. You mustn't fear him so. You know Papa. Christophe... promise me that even if... It won't make any difference to us. Not in the least, Daisy. - What about you? - Me? You know very well. A minute to enter the château and lock the doors. A minute to sneak back upstairs. A minute to catch your breath and look asleep... 17 meters is fine. We light it at 3 minutes to midnight. From your brother, Pierre. Look at the envelope. "Monsieur de Maubrun." For a year now, he can't bring himself to say "Marquis". - Goodness me. - What? Nothing. Pierre's coming tomorrow. Hard to believe. All my children at Maubrun, at once. - Anyone would think I was dying. - Papa! Don't make such a face! You know how delighted I am. Nine for dinner, like when your mother was alive. That's what Maubrun is for. Time for a shower. My, I'm famished! The devout of Camaret Bought themselves a mule... A republican mule... To you. Chicken! Trumps. You swine! Trumps again. You're so jammy. Thank you. 50. Is this going to last long? Aunt Mathilde, is Grandma's ghost story true? Yes, why? The priest reckons it's a joke. Old wives' tales, he said. If you twins are trying to be cheeky by misquoting a priest, you're wasting your time. I'll have a word with him. As for this "story" as you call it... I remember it well, I was seven. It was the night July 13 to 14. At precisely midnight. Did you see them yourself? As good as. My mother did. The two pictures fell off the wall, so she obviously didn't dream it. A duel with your brother over a girl... No flies on Grandpa. Very well, I'll tell your father. Why, Aunt Mathilde? You know very well he forbids slang in the salon. It's not slang, it's history. Golly, another dinner jacket. How elegant you Turks are! We go out a lot in Ankara. It's important to dress well. It's stifling here. May I, Aunt Mathilde? Not that one, it's flimsy. Oh, that one too? You'll be glad to hear Pierre's coming. Great, we can smoke! What have you been up to, Mathilde? Doesn't the priest look rough? Since the concordat broke down, our priests are required to starve to death. Where are my pliers? We never touched them! Return them by tomorrow. Gontran, that window... SQ? So we'd better hope it doesn't rain. The house is falling to bits. Maubrun will be a swimming pool. There are 24 windows like it. Feel free to fix them. Can't we call in a carpenter? We'll send the bill to Ankara. Mathilde, forgive my daughter's rudeness. It's barely 8 o'clock. Five past. Paris has given her bad habits. No, Paul, Mademoiselle isn't here. Such disregard for the staff. At least they're punctual! Who taught you that the lady of the house can be late? If I hadn't raised you myself, I'd wonder which lout... Dinner is served. It's time, let's go. Sure Papa is asleep? He was dozing in the salon. - There. - Come on! What's going on? - Damn, he heard us! - Quick! What now? We go LIP- What are you up to? Well, Papa... We were hot, we went for a walk. It's cooler to the north. The north? So... Goodnight, Papa, sorry to wake you up. You heard it too. See, Jean? I was right. July 13, like my mother. Not that I saw them. Well, I saw them. Come here, you two! These are your ghosts. So that was your priest story before dinner! Come here! Closer. May I? Of course, but... I fear for your rod. Allow me, I promise not to spare them. Right. They're all yours. - Tomorrow, 7 am, in my office. - Very well, Papa. Good night, Aunt Mathilde. Good night, Mathilde. Still, it worked really well. Now how did those rascals manage that? Which one? Not this one. - He smokes too much. - It's his age. He's in no hurry. - Hello, Papa. - Hello, you chaps. No rain this year, then! Now let's see. Who's first? Papa, you mustn't. We're too old now. At Stan, they say corporal punishment is immoral and outdated. Well, that's great! Come here. A beating is just what you deserve! That's that done. On your way, now. You've got till lunch to apologize to your aunt. Wasn't too bad. Is he getting old? Are you crazy? Our trick amused him. Hey, how about a hand with mass? Not till you're a cardinal! Hello, Philippe. Sore backside, horseman? I didn't want to interfere... Interfere? You shouldn't have. Corporal punishment... Is immoral and outdated, I know. I don't understand. They understand very well. Go deliver mass. Monsieur Arthus! I didn't recognize you. Hello, Mr Gontran. How's Marie? Is the boss home? Could be. He was at the harrow but he's probably snacking by now. Thanks, Marie. We'll call on him. No, he doesn't like that. I'll serve fried potatoes and salad with the roast. You'll have to pull out the stops. Pierre is coming. Don't worry, she just refused me three dishes Pierre doesn't like. Quite right. Being at Oxford won't fatten him up. So what is it tonight? Scrambled eggs with croutons for starters, then the roast, fried potatoes, salad and cheese. Shall we swipe one? A Vosne Romanée to wash the pâté down? The old man owes us one, after that thrashing. Paul's taken care of the wine. Tough luck on my cellar. - Hello, Marquis. - Hello, postman. - Ma'am... - Thank you. How are your artichokes? Thirsty, obviously! Cheers. Thank you. See you soon, Marquis. Beautiful. "The Prince of Conti invites Marquis of Maubrun and family" "...to join him in a duck hunt on his land," "...Sunday 17 July 1955." Signed: Conti. The hunt will begin at 7am. Engraved, and in color. Like in American movies. Look. "Prince Durant" as the kids call him can afford to indulge himself. I shouldn't go to the old yokel's but I will. He has too many ducks! And I'll take everyone with me, even the twins. You stay with your aunt. - She'll be gone by then. - Then stay alone. - Papa! - My mind is made up. Maybe I shall go to Conti anyway. I think not, Daisy. What are you up to? Nothing, just doing homework. Look where they're laying! - Marquis... - Marie... I came early for the Saint Victor, but my clay workers will eat everything. With all my kids here, the butter won't last long. I knew Mr Arthus was here, I saw him with Mr Gontran, going to see the boss. You have a handsome boy there, Marquis. See the boss, you say? Very well. Bye, then, Marie. Take all that to the kitchen for me. Bye, then. Don't worry, we know the way. And 15 million is optimistic. It will take twice that to restore everything. But I can't offer any more. We'll identify priorities. We'll be spoilt for choice. That's him. I told you we shouldn't. We've nothing to hide. I'm doing this for him too. Just in time, Arthus! You're in excellent hands with my manager but if I can be of any help... Mind where you put your feet! This isn't the automobile club. We're not going behind your back. It never occurred to me. I'm delighted to see you. Surprised but delighted. I'm sure you're full of ideas after all your travel. Not like us. Right, Gontran? Fleur Normande calved last night. Take the taxi back. I'll hitch a ride with the Turk. I wouldn't mind being kept informed too. If ever... - You seem angry. - Me? I haven't felt so fine in ages. Say, Arthus, could I drive her to Maubrun. I finished the war as an aviator. Looks fine to me. How's my writing? Wait... The Marquis de Malbrun thanks Prince de Conti for his invitation to which he will be most partial to attend. "Most partial"! It's not like he's a real prince. Come on, let's post it. One moment. Daisy's stuck on the son. - Shame about his dad. - You don't know love! I need to scold you. You should have talked to me before Gontran. Gontran leads a tough life, like me. Only he's younger. That's what I was trying to spare you both... Come on, I need to check whether Gustave has turned up. You've earned a pile. So what? My father had more, he didn't need to talk about it. I'm not criticizing. You need to know how to use money. Maubrun isn't Iranian oil, it isn't the stock exchange. It's not the same thing. Nice of you to come, Gustave. I know, I promised ages ago. What do I care...? What do I care about your 15 million? Maubrun as a limited company? Me as CEO of Maubrun Holdings Ltd? Honestly! It's all very well wanting to modernize but this isn't Georgia or Ohio, remember. The fields are tiny here. What with all the terracing... It's what you want. Your farmers, who, between you and me... You won't renew their leases. I'll pay them off. Problem solved. You'll have a clean bill of health. Evict my farmers? They're holding you back, making a fortune on your back. Whatever next. The truth is, it's crazy. You complain you're broke, overtaxed, with crippling maintenance costs... Another stuck window Gontran can't fix everything. Who's complaining? Did Gontran suggest... Gontran didn't say anything. Evict my farmers? Their families have served ours for six generations! That's a lease that can't be broken. You capitalists are really something. You're heartless! Bank accounts, appraisals, admin, business plans... Like the commissars. All the same. Cold as the coffers. Or a guillotine! I think you're wrong. You don't realize how things have changed. And they'll change some more. Alright, Gustave? People can be so nasty, even when they're educated. Especially when they're educated! What's wrong? It's a long story. Drop by later for a chat. It does no harm to chat. A problem shared is a problem halved. Thank you, Marquis. Tired already, Father? - Remember I wanted to talk to you? - Oh? If it wasn't urgent, it can't be too serious. To be honest, it's why I'm here. Jesuits never go anywhere except on official assignments. Let's not exaggerate. Promise you won't get mad. Don't worry, go on. It's not about the limited company... That issue has been settled. Are you the Pope's nuncio? It's about Daisy. Daisy can look after herself. The village priest is an excellent confessor. She has me. All a girl needs is a confessor and a father? You want to marry her off? You're all obsessed with marrying people. I want Daisy to be happy, Not the same as being married. You sound like an agony aunt. Leave it to the Weeklies. Daisy loves Christophe de Conti. Or thinks she does. Young girls love everyone. She'll get over it. You're so sure about everything. I'm sure that Daisy won't marry the son of an imposter. A man who bought a Montenegrin title after stealing a historic name. I'll sit next to him in church and shoot his ducks but my daughter? Never! I don't wish to appear ridiculous. Better watch what you're doing. Think it over. Don't worry, I have. Daisy is over 18. Need I tell you that my authority over her doesn't stop when she's 18? For the simple reason that it's God-given. I'm responsible for you all, until I die. Even you, Father. You know very well. Now you're all here, don't spoil it for me. Back to more serious matters... Dammit, someone's here. Papa, it's Pierre! Pierrot? My child. Hello, Papa. Maybe he's changed his mind, he's not a bad sort. Made your mind up? It'll be just as hard tomorrow. I'll talk to him tomorrow. - Is it like this every clay? - Often. Sleep well, Gustave, leave it with me. Why let yourself be poisoned? I can't throw them out, they need me. You've spoiled them. If a child sneezes, they come running to you. So? I'm the Mayor! And that... A waste of time. You flatter yourself they like you but they despise you. They might not like me but I like them. Life's too short to worry about others. It would be too long if you didn't. Poor Gustave. The teacher wants rid of him because he drinks a little. But what will become of him if he can't be school caretaker? No home, no garden... Will he drink less? So, are we playing? Thank you. Cut... a heart for you... Read 'em and weep! Small slam, as promised. 750 and 100 bonus. The priest is lucky. No, just a good player. I'm no mug at bridge or hunting. So Maubrun's reverend father hunts? Why not? Canon law allows it. Bravo! Don't mind us. A gun in his cassock. Bang bang! It's no crime. No crime, they're only ducks. What fun! Makes you proud to be a man, right? You're all the same. Our very own Rousseau! Don't expect to change us. No. Seven years of Jesuitery doesn't change you. - We've been around for so long. - Indeed. The old aristocrat has a thick hide, even under the cassock. Mind your own business! I don't judge your lifestyle. Can't you see, he's kidding us. Sure I'm kidding! Sure, it's just a laugh! What can dent your sense of entitlement? Under the gaze of your ancestors, horsemen and hunters, born and bred. Born and bred! Where does he get these ideas? Don't ask me about ideas. Poor Philippe. They forgot to get you to read Pascal. We know you've read Pascal, Nietzsche, the Bhagavad Gita. No Bhagavad Gita? Well, don't blame us! All this because we like hunting? Each to his own. Don't kid yourself. This is something else. Sure it is! It's about whether Pierre's revolutionary tribunal will cut off our heads! You fool! Pierre... Who still wants to cut your heads off? You drag your names around like gun carriages. You go too far! I'm tired of this comedy, this pious sham! You'll bring up Agincourt next! And Recroix, and the brothers dueling over a woman! Dammit! Trawl through history, find those heroic acts, pin them in your collectors boxes. The thing is, it's all old hat by now, isn't it? How dare you! Count of Maubrun, my eye! Upper crust, that's what we are! Like pals, like anyone else. No different. Just as disgusting, greedy and cowardly. If you came to tell us that, better go home. The door is right there. The train for Paris leaves soon. Pierre... You're in my home here. Your home. I ask you to forget these quarrels, these words. Which, I might add, pass me by. What can I say? I'm from another generation. Now leave us. I need to be alone with him. Good night, Papa. Good night, Pierre. Good night. Good night. Good night, you cad. How hard it must be to live in the modern world with these sensibilities that you get from... I don't know, maybe your mother. Not from me. The rest of us are lucky to be so blinkered. Forgive me. No need. It's nothing. Nothing at all. Time for us to down one too. How many did the prince bag? One. And I helped him out. If not for folk like him, we'd be working down the factory. The weather turned out beautiful. A nice surprise. Nice fagade, but I'd get bored here. Oh no! His serene highness is served. The Marquis of Maubrun. Reverend Father of Maubrun. Count Arthus of Maubrun, Count Gontran of Maubrun, Count Osmond of Maubrun, Count Louis-César of Maubrun. There. All counted up, I think! I'm famished. Those rascals shoot well. They bagged everything I missed! They were right behind me. Bang-bang! Done and dusted. If only they were as good at Latin. But aside from our priest, the family has no talent for it. Still, each to his own. Latin is for traders. Pâté, duck or lark. Both for me! I'm a man of appetite! Please, no need to apologize! I don't know about you but I'm wary of people who don't eat. It's a sign of a resentful, twisted mind. Very fishy. Yes, people who don't know how to live. The world is crawling with them nowadays. What about the Reverend Father? Father Philippe agrees. He's going to be a smiling Jesuit! The hunt was expertly organized. Gruault-La-Rose 1937. Tell my gamekeeper, he'll be delighted. It's all down to him. I don't mind admitting, I'm a novice at hunting. As these young rascals noticed. In my youth I had other fish to fry besides duck and moorhen. How's the Gruault-La-Rose? Delicate, and full of fire. This claret is a revelation with the subtle aroma of lark paté. And that's down to you! This time, yes. I've always had the gift. You can't teach it. France is being taken over by whisky-drinkers! Magazines, cinemascope, penicillin... Soon our chefs will be replaced by machines. Don't be so pessimistic. I enjoy reading history books while traveling or between trips. It's fascinating. History is full of twists and turns. Man is an amazing creature. He resists, adapts, survives... In the end, man always wins. Go ahead. That's the pleasure of friendship. I don't mince words, I speak my mind. Folk in Paris act all friendly but they have no friends. Very true, sir. Don't call me sir. After lark pâté and a 1937 Gruault-La-Rose, it's Maubrun and Conti, like schoolboys. Well, Maubrun, that pleases me too. More than you might think. Much more. You must call on us sometime. With pleasure. Mademoiselle de Maubrun! Good morning! Don't get up, please. I thought I'd invite myself to lunch. Good idea! Lovely to have you at Conti. Which I'm afraid we must leave. Thank you for a most charming morning. But we've just started. Please excuse us. You're leaving? Yes, with you. No, I think I shall stay awhile. Daisy, please come with me if you don't wish me to reveal the reasons for a decision that upsets me. There! That's real aristocrats for you. Descendants of crusaders! If workmen acted like that, people would expect it. But them... we have to congratulate and thank them. With a smile! They can do as they please, and it's perfect, distinguished. Grandsons of crusaders! They kick you up the backside and you have to thank them for it! To hell with their distinction! Spongers, wimps and scoundrels, the lot of them! Clinging to their family tree like an umbrella. Because that's all they have! He was odious. They won't set foot here again. It was fit of anger. No, Christophe. It's a plan. My ducks, my lark pâté, my claret... He honors me by helping me out with them. But when his daughter wants to become part of my family... whoa! You ask too much, gentlemen. You know who you're dealing with? The Maubruns! The genuine Maubruns. And who are you? Conti? Conti... Ah! Conti 1926. Conti 1926. What of it? You have to start somewhere. You started by taking the trouble to be born! Everything I have, everything I am has come from me, that's the difference. Who do you think you are? Whatever you say or do you've got 7 liters of blood, like everyone else. She's different. What disgusts me most is that he thinks me calculating. We might not be born from the thigh of Jupiter but we still have our honor. And now? NOW? What about us? You and me... No, Papa, Daisy and me. It's true, you love her. Didn't you know? Did you think - like Maubrun - that I regarded it as a marriage of convenience? What can I tell you? That imbecile is so annoying, he makes you lose sight of the simplest things. Well, if you love her, I don't care what Maubrun thinks. By hook or by crook, you have to marry her, my boy. There's no getting out of it. Another omelet, Marquis? No, thanks. Hello, château de Conti? Christophe de Conti, please. It's Miss de Maubrun. Personal. I thought as much. If I can't trust you, I'll lock you in your room. You don't realize what you're doing but you soon will. Isn't Miss Daisy joining us? I don't think she's hungry. Was the call a message for me? I'd have said. You're not coming to vespers without a hat... I'm going to a movie. A movie? Disgraceful! Have you seen Daisy? Not since she left with you. Isn't she in her room? No, or in the outhouses. She's vanished. - Oh dear. - What of it? To vespers! Not in the garden. - Paul hasn't seen her? - No, Papa. Check the grounds. Daisy! Hello. - Hello, ma'am. - Miss de Maubrun. I'd like a room for two. I have a nice one left. For...? For me. - Twin? - Double. Very well. The 17th, then. I'll send your luggage up. No need. Mr Christophe de Conti will come for me. Send him up to my room. I'm not to be disturbed. Very well, Miss. A coat of arms tarnished! Doesn't it amuse you? No, it's most unlike the Maubruns. Looking for someone? Yes, Miss de Maubrun asked me to meet her here. You must be Mr Christophe de Conti. Miss de Maubrun has taken a room. I believe she's waiting for you. Thank you. Ask Miss de Maubrun to come down. Tell her I'll wait here. Very well. And get me Maubrun on the phone. - Where's the booth? - Here, I'll put you through. Hello, get me Maubrun, please. Thank you. Hello, is that Maubrun? May I speak to Arthus de Maubrun? Thank you. Hello, this is Christophe de Conti. No, that's not why I'm calling. I'm calling from La Siréne. If you don't mind, I wanted to ask you... Daisy! Daisy, this is madness, you shouldn't have. You look so excited, it's funny. I adore you! Didn't you bring a suitcase? Don't you know we leave for Paris tomorrow morning? To be married there? - That's impossible. - Impossible! Remember what we said. Even if he refused... We'll bring him round, but not like this. There are people here who know us. I really couldn't care less! Maybe you're the one who's embarrassed. I admit, it hadn't occurred to me. You're so romantic. Be careful. You're turning your back on everything you ever loved. On everything we both detest! Don't say that! Did you see the way he treated you? He has his reasons. Now you're defending him! Come outside. We'll have some privacy. You're afraid we'll be seen together? Don't you see, it's for your benefit that I refuse? You'd soon reproach me if I didn't. You say that now! You should have told me sooner that you like me as long as you call the shots. That you'll marry me as long as I have my father's blessing. You should have told me you were a good boy who worries what people will think. Why are you so hard on me? Because you don't love me enough. I hoped you'd appreciate my proving my love for you. I can give you no more. Instead I get told off, warned, counseled... Like we're an old couple. Daisy... You know I'm afraid for you, and you alone. You mean too much to me. Don't keep talking about your fears, even your fears for me. Tell me that this nightmare's over. Let's leave and not look back. We will leave. I promise. Christophe... You think this is just an act of defiance? Yes, Daisy. Isn't it? It was, earlier. Daisy... look at me. - Did you call him? - You can't blame me. You're having quite an eventful clay. I hope we're clone with the drama. Come, we'll have a drink then go home. - Out of the question! - Sorry? I won't set foot back in that house! As you please, it's no skin off my nose. We're leaving. I doubt that. Christophe is dining with me. Isn't that right? - Will you join us? - Christophe! - Be reasonable... - That's all you ever say! - Please... - Enough! - Where are you going? - I'm free, aren't I? What are you afraid of? My brother is waiting. Have a lovely evening together. To liquidate a cop. Monsieur de Paris's axe had seen better clays. In this godforsaken life you could take out anyone but never the fuzz. Juries never accept mitigating circumstances, you always max out in the slammer. 2) Max out in the slammer: Long jail term. The clay before his ward is clue to get it in the neck, a pleader can always try buttering up the head of state. Killing a cop gets you the chop. Just looking at 'em funny on the bus is enough to get you 30 bags of sand from the judge. 3) Bags of sand: Grand. Arthus? Daisy! Daisy, come here. Open this door. Daisy, open it! Daisy... you've got five seconds to open the door. Go ahead. Like when I was 12. Understand now? Do you understand! What's the point if you're incapable of understanding? Why not just run away with him? Why come back here? For me? No need. To me, you've already gone. It's over, do you hear? Full stop! Nothing is over, on the contrary. Will you be quiet! I came back because I never want to see Christophe again! I despise him for letting you bully him! Why do they all tremble before you and bend to your will? Don't you see? I'm unhappy, you've won. Why not celebrate? You must be happy. Daisy... You've no right. If your mother was still alive... Don't keep asking her to back you up, it's too easy. Mama would have understood. You say you love us but you love only yourself! We have to honor, obey, flatter you, sacrifice everything. Don't ask me to love you too! No one here dares say it but everyone is getting sick of you! Papa... Papa... Don't look like that, please. I didn't mean what I said. Papa! Papa, let me in. Talk to me, I beg you. Forgive me. I don't want you to hate me. Papa... You're all I have left. Maître Cohen, you know the law. What must I do not to be evicted? The best way is to stop drinking. Bastards. I'll give them sermons. With a punch in the nose! Dodecaphonic music, atonal music, serial music... All are familiar to any worthwhile musician. It was not ever thus. The piece you are about to hear marked the moment when music got back on track, the only intrinsically legitimate kind, shaping its own future. Good morning, Cohen. Sit down, old boy. Good to see you. Did you bring your pipe? Never in the morning. - What brings you here? - Well... As you know, a long-standing law allows each spouse's assets to pass to direct descendants, with the surviving spouse holding the legacy in usufruct. Good. Madame de Maubrun's dowry consisted of deeds, securities, cash, gradually invested in your farms, and château. Absolutely correct. Meaning that legally speaking, ...only legally speaking, you actually co-own Maubrun with your children. And have clone for 14 years. So? So... Your children are fond of Maubrun, no? - I'm glad to say. - They've asked me to... Asked you to...? Pierre, stop him! I was afraid. So I see! Easy does it... What did they do to you? Tie some old iron to your backside? Like a saucepan on a cat's tail? He's a spunky one. Thank you. I was about to call on you. If I may be so bold... I take no pleasure in this. I have but one son, it concerns his happiness. What is this obsession everyone has with happiness? I don't even know what it means. For lovers, happiness is the opposite of the unhappiness that divides people. This is about your daughter's happiness too. Sir, my daughter can speak for herself! We are quite open with each other. After last night... Nothing happened. Tongues are wagging! Let them, sir. Much as I hate scandal, I hate blackmail more. Know any more words likely to cut me to the quick? You waste your time. I've decided to stay calm. I know your nasty words are unjustified, they won't make me lose my cool. I've seen worse! How can I fail to remain serene? I am His Serene Highness, am I not? As I am only too aware. And your courtesy extends to sending me messages like this one. I wasn't going to bring it up but... I thought it was the twins playing a trick. A funny one. I like those rascals. But now I think this is your work. So allow me to tell you, Mr Rimécourt de Maubrun, to get your own house in order first! That's what aristocracy must be all about! You let the aristocracy be, sir. We tend not to talk about it. Until further notice allow me to be the sole judge of what I and my children do. And don't expect an apology! "Most partial." Those rascals are right. I'm right too. We were saying how fond my children were of Maubrun. That's right. And they've asked you to...? The thing is, I don't want to... You don't want to say it. Well, let me say it! They want you to ask for the accounts. "What have you done with our money?" That's it, isn't it? Well, they'll have them! Sir, they are sorry. Sorry? How so? The law is on their side and the same for everyone. Liberty, equality, fraternity. Cohen... This offends you even more than it does me. You did it because it's your job. Good. And with your usual tact, for which I thank you. See you soon, old boy. You're always welcome here. The twins! Go bring your brothers and sisters to the salon. And you come too! No injuries? Can't see any, Marquis. I wanted to hitch him up. I won't try anything so stupid again. Everyone does stupid things. This one doesn't matter. Is your son faring well, Paul? Yes, Marquis. I just heard he's been given a posting at Saumur. That's good, Paul. You're very fortunate. So, it's all kicking off at the château. Pierre, no one wants to laugh about hurting Papa. It's for his own good. You know all about hurting people for their own good. It's your specialty. Here he comes. Fall in! Everybody here? I can't even see you. And I like it that way. My first instinct was to run away and disappear. Where to? I don't know. To never see you, never talk to you again. We no longer understand each other, there's nothing more to be said. Disputes can be settled. No, sir, not when your own children send in their lawyer! You have no children, you don't know what it's like. It's as if you're all strangers to me. Yes, strangers. You misunderstand. See? I'm right, we don't speak the same language. I told myself I was too old, I didn't understand. The rules of life no longer apply. That's how it is nowadays. At 15, you talk the talk without yet walking the walk. At 20, you fear nothing, not even cowardice. By 30, you want to live in luxury. Don't deny it, Gontran, you're all fed up of me! Daisy was quite open about it. Not that I don't want to leave you to it. I'm tired too. Just like you. The thing is... ...forgive me for seeming so ridiculous... I can't. My duty is as much - even more - to my predecessors in the earth at Maubrun who have toiled across Europe as it is to you. So I stay for them. And for me, dammit! You have plotted to hitch my name to the Conti name acquired by Durant. Daisy, stay here! He's not the one I hold in contempt. At least he fights. These names you don't deserve have to be earned. Quiet! You've all spoken through a lawyer, now it's my turn. Papa, I'm trying to keep my cool but you go too far. We are still your children... and Maubruns. Maubruns? Look at you! What do you think? You just have to kiss a lady's hand, dress for dinner and rinse your fingers after the fish course? What we are comes at a price. A high price. A price we have always paid, but when we start to skimp and try to have it both ways, ...aristocrat and arriviste, ...aristocrat and tightrope walker, or carpet dealer, ...then you're soon just an arriviste or a carpet dealer! Me, you mean? Everyone! Maybe there's no aristocracy left after all. Maybe money has made us all rotten. And if we don't have any, it's even worse. It burns our hearts. Maybe those who bear a name are like you: Mere facades, and trompe-l'oeils! Maybe aristocrats are elsewhere, among the people. Unknown and humble but fervent, proud and generous ready to give everything for nothing. They still exist and they always will. For you, it's over. Survivors. Shadows. The guillotine was a neat solution. One final word. Since happiness and opulence are your watchwords, may your lives be happy, rich and full. But allow me to live mine as I see fit! We have nothing more to say. All this because I offered him money. He just wants to die stoically in the ruins of his château! I work, and I'm just as aristocratic as he is. Only I didn't come from Turkey for a vacation. I'm off. You're all invited to La Baule. Gontran? I need to work. Then you should take a break. Father? No vacation for me. I want to pray... for us all. Especially for Pa pa. But away from here. Put me on the train to Paris. Daisy? No, I'm staying at Maubrun. In my room, but at Maubrun. As you please. Never mind. Corning to La Baule? La Baule, with all those naked people? No, I'm staying here. I'm not annoyed. I enjoyed Papa's words. Archaeologically very interesting. He called you a coward! He's right. I like only cowards. Any man who isn't scared by this absurd world is an imbecile. Why us? We had nothing to do with it. If we just sit and take it, then we really are cowards. He's right, we're not Maubruns. What then? I don't know but we have to do something. Being a Maubrun comes at a price. We'll pay it, right? If bombs started falling now, we'd stay beneath them, for half an hour, just to piss him off. To show we're Maubruns, not wimps. Louis-César... We can do it. - What? - Come on! Understand? One each. Yes. Let's go. Too bad for him. Help yourself. Nine. We each take one hundred paces, count to sixty, then start firing, all right? All right. Protect yourself. I'll do likewise. Say... I'll leave you everything I have. Even my flick knife. But I owe the newspaper guy 30 francs. Don't worry. Careful, that one veers left. Shall we? Let's go! - Louis-César! - What is it? Look, promise me you won't cheat. Fire at me properly and try to hit me. Unless we risk our necks, this means nothing. You're right, let's swear it. No pretending, it isn't right. I swear to try to shoot you down with each of my nine shots. I swear to try to shoot you down with each of my nine shots. Now go! Lord, I am sorry, for having offended Thee who art good and deserving of my love... Thou who art good, and I resolve to sin no more. I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace to sin no more. Are you there? I'm here! So, how's it going? Still with us? Pretty much. You? I'll be fine. You nearly got me there. Watch yourself! Osmond? It's OK, I'm not scared. Osmond, answer me! Osmond, are you dead? Not this time, fella. You're aim is bad! - How many shots you got left? - Seven! That's a lot. Let's fire! You're right. Stop it... Stop, for God's sake! Osmond, stop! What the hell are you doing? What the hell were you doing? Nothing, just playing. Really? What? Seeing whether we were Maubruns. I thought I forbade you to use those guns in the grounds. Go and put them back. Very well, Papa. He really got us. Not really. It hit him hard. Gatina Lauris. Are we disturbing you? Not at all. My father will be sorry to have missed you. I trust the twins are good guides. Indeed. Most interesting. Second, earlier portrait. Captain. Given by Richelieu for slicing 14 musketeers through the pancreas. Goodness! Made a knight on the battlefield by his friend du Guesclin. Jean-César de Maubrun. Looks like Robespierre. Funny. You know what Robespierre did to him? He cut his head off. Surely a misunderstanding. Quick, Gustave, the school caretaker, has gone mad, training a rifle on the kids because he's threatened with eviction. The Marquis could talk him round but as he's not here, would you try? It has to be someone from the château. I'll go. The priest won't be back till tonight. Right, I'll talk him round. Suzanne... your father's acting the fool. You'll be first. Bastards! You're not sneering at the drunk now! The good-for-nothing! Scared, aren't you? You're scared! On your knees. Kneel before me! Or two kids get it. Hear me, Octave? Starting with yours! You want to buy your way out of it, right, Octave? To hell with your money! What I want is vengeance. Will you talk to him, Pierre? Yes. Take a gun. Certainly not. Watch it! Any further and I'll shoot! Oh no. Who are you? Maubrun... Pierre de Maubrun. No way! Yes. It's been three years but you know me well. You know I don't mean you any harm. You're armed. In your pocket! No. Stop there! I don't want to shoot you! You're not going to shoot me. I want to be alone with him. The circumstances demand that we let bygones be bygones. Thank you. I have a son myself, I know how you must feel. No, sir, that's not possible. Nobody can. Arthus... So... You'll have to go without me. I'm not going back to Maubrun. You're not? No, but don't worry, I'm not going to kill myself or join the Church. Just stay here, in this convent, where I'm kind of at home anyway. Chop wood... polish brasses... See no one. But it isn't possible. I know very well that... God has hit me hard, Arthus. The twins almost killed each other, and now Pierre... But... what is necessary for your happiness I want nothing to do with. I can't. Do you see? I want to be first to suffer from my own demands. You're at the helm now. Spare a thought for the farmers, though. And for Félicie, and Paul, even though they can no longer be of service. Anyway... you'll see. Go, Arthus. Go and tell them. And forbid them from trying to see me. That's your last order from me. Go ahead, old boy. Papa! Subtitles: Eclair Group
