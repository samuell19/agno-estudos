Episode 1 Master Cheh! Stay away from boundless hardship. I don't think I know you. I know you don't. I'm Emptiness of Shaolin Temple. Oh! So you're Shaolin's Master Emptiness! We had not met before, pardon me. Master Cheh. Are you going to use another trick... ...to bring out your old master? So you can avenge your kins, once and for all? Master Cheh. Please come to the Wild Pig Forest! Master. If you would kindly tell me... ...where Sing Kwan is at the moment, I, Cheh Seun, would do anything for you. Master Cheh. Despite my lowliness, I would like to end this feud. No way! Sing Kwan behaved badly when he was drunk... ...and he regrets it deeply. But how could you murder 30 people, just because you wanted him out in the open? I won't rest until I see his face. You're no match for him at all. Is that so? I must kill him once and for all! Master Cheh. Why don't we make a deal right here? What for? Your master killed 13 of your kin. Now why don't you hit me 13 times? If you're able to hurt me... ...I guarantee your master will come out. Can you take my Seven Fists? I'll try to. But there is one condition. If you're unable to hurt me, this terrible feud is considered settled for good. Master. I would hate to hurt you. That shows that you, Master Cheh, are compassionate. But then we still have our agreement... ...so please begin. O.K.! Master. Three punches already! Alright. I promise you, I won't kill the innocents. Master Cheh. What about your feud with Sing Kwan? Huh... He's my... archenemy! It's a sin. Master Cheh, you still have 10 punches. Go ahead! Well, if your punches fail to hurt me... ...you'll be no match for your master, and I will not let Sing Kwan see you. O.K. Pardon me then! Ah, Shaolin's King Kong Instructible Kung Fu! He hasn't made a sound at all! He must be attempting to beat me! No wonder he's quiet! Master. If i do injure you, will Sing Kwan come and meet me? Well he promised! Master! Master... Without revenge... I'd rather die! Master! Master! Master Cheh. Your... Your master... ...is coming soon. You... must take care. Understand? Master! I'm so ungrateful! Oh... I'm sorry! Men... must die somehow. Oh... I am worse than an animal! I am useless. I failed to change your heart...! Sing Kwan! Sing Kwan! Come out and meet me! I really can't believe that Sing Kwan... ...would break his promise. Emptiness! You lied to me! You lied to me! Let me kill you! Not true. I... I didn't lie! I... I only... I feel sorry, for you. Master. Do you have a last wish? I wish... I... I only wish that you... ...would think of me, whenever... Whenever you kill... in the future... Master! Sing Kwan! Excellency. How is everything? The Dragon Sword has already appeared. In the martial world, all are fighting for it. That's perfect. Where is A'Sahm? Yes. As you ordered, he's on the watch. Should we begin the second step of our plan? -Yes we should. / -Hm. A'Sahm is foolhardy; you are better. Yes. I'll take care of it myself. I am glad that you will take care of it yourself. -Take A'Yih with you. / -Yes. -How's the Ming clan? / -Yes. Uh... Yeung Ding Tin is missing, no one knows what's happened. Yin Tin Ching has established the Eagle Clan. Cheh Seun... kills everywhere. By now, the Ming clan has already been broken into pieces. Also, those who call themselves righteous in the martial world... ...have come to hate the Ming clan a lot more than they ever did before. Thatâ€˜s terrific! Very good. Excellency, Sing Kwan wants to see you. Sure. Your Excellency. You want me to stay around? No need. You have a duty to do. You should take off tonight! Is it you, Sing Kwan? Sing Kwan? Come on down. Shaolin clan disciple of Master Emptiness, Great Truth pays due respect! Since when have you turned into a Buddhist monk? About one month ago, Excellency. What's so good about being a monk? There are... many advantages. So far, the first advantage... ...is that my master, Master Emptiness... ...was killed by Cheh Seun today. He's dead and gone! Do you mean... ...Emptiness, of the four great monks of Shaolin Clan? That's right. He was a very compassionate man... ...and wished to end the quarrel between myself and my master. Today he's killed by Cheh Seun, ...and so from now on, Shaolin clan and Cheh Seun will fight forever! That's right. From now on, Shaolin and the Ming clan will also fight on. -Let us drink to that! / -Thank you, Your Excellency! The Supreme One, the Dragon Sword... ...and the Sky Sword; which is the best? The precious Sky Sword, I trust you had never seen it before. Now you can take a look! Thank you, Your Excellency! It's wonderful. Certainly deserves its name! There's also only one Dragon Sword, a real precious item. Too bad that I... I've never seen it. Hey... Ah... this plan was written by me, you can take a look. The Dragon Sword has already appeared. As long as we can follow our plan, ...when we succeed, you will become the Supreme One... ...and the Sword will certainly fall into your hand! Thank you very much, Your Excellency. I will surely try my very best. Is Yeung Ding Tin really dead? I saw it with my own eyes. Here, sir. Come on, you guys! Welcome, welcome, welcome! This way please, this way please! Waiter! Give us a room here, will ya'? -Right away, sir! / -Innkeeper, we have some stuff there. Ah, we have a very big backyard! Please, feel free to use it! Hey Waiter, show them the way! That way, please! -Yes! Right away. -Master, please. Follow me, this way. This way, please! Hey Mister, le- let me help you! -Hey, no thank you. / -We don't need your help. -What is it? / -This? It's only salt. Try to wake them up. Wake up! Wake up, hurry up! Wake up, please. Wake up. Hurry, hurry. Come on! Quietly. Otherwise you'll wake the others up. Come on! Quick. Come on, come on! The Three Water Drops. So you're Sea Sand Clan! We found the valuable Dragon Sword first! It's stolen, and we're gonna keep it! With your limited kung fu, do you think you can keep it? Hey, you! We don't want any troubles. Be smart, get out of our way! What kind of trick is that? Isn't one death enough? Why risk another? We must hurry. We'll find out about our brothers later. Let's go. Shaolin's King Kong Claws? Hey, Brother! This is really a precious item! A real treasure! The treasure is mine! Cheung Bak Weirdo, you think you could take this sword today? Not so easy! White Zombie, you don't have any business here! Today, I'll take the sword and your life! -Hey, don't come closer! / -Hey, old man! Take it easy. It just so happened that I passed by this place. Hahaha, the Dragon Sword should go to a superb master! The Mountain Shaking Palm is sure powerful. You're from Wutang? I am Yu Doi Ahm of Wutang. What is your name, master? So you are Wutang's Master Yu! With due respect, see you someday soon! "The Supreme One, the Dragon Sword..." "...commands the whole world, feared by all men!" A real great sword! Master Yu. These are the so-called "beard needles". They seldom miss. Beard needles contain poison. Within the next 12 hours, you'll die of poisoning. How about some antidote? Beard needles? So you're from Eagle Clan! Master Yu, you're really knowledgeable! But I am a nobody in the Eagle Clan. The Dragon Sword, give it to me... ...and then the antidote will be yours at once. It's a very dirty trick. You're despicable! Master Yu. However good one's kung fu is, one has to act first. Do you think I will change my mind just because of the poison in my body? I have the patience. I'll wait. Very soon, you'll want to give the Dragon Sword to me! Please excuse me, what is your name? You don't need to know. I want to ask you if you would like to... handle my goods. Pardon me. Our company does not handle products of unknown sources. Good. My name is Yen. Mistress Yan. What is it that you want us to protect? Before I tell you what I want you to protect for me, I want you to keep in mind all the conditions. Firstly, I want you to protect the goods yourself. Secondly, you must deliver them in 10 days, and you must hurry day and night. Thirdly, if there is any delay... ...your life will be in great danger, and this Dragon Inn will be in deep trouble. This is nonsense! Master Dou. What's the rage for? Here are two thousand taels of gold. They will all go to you, if you agree to protect my goods. Mistress Yen. What is it that you want us to protect? But... are you certain that you can fulfill the conditions that i set? Yes, I promise you! For this amount of money... ...I'll even put my life in danger! When will we get it? -Get what? / -The product concerned! It's right here. I want you to protect this master here. -You mean him? / -That's right. You are to escort him to Wu-Tang. Lead him to Wu-Tang's Principal, Master Cheung Sam Fung. If there's any delay, or you fail your job...
