Man, I think it's a place that struck fear. ♪♪ It was a place that I never wanted to go. (man speaking indistinctly over police radio) I am Lieutenant Sam Robinson. I'm born and raised here in California, right out of Oakland. I've been here for 22 years. I worked 10 years on death row. Maybe six to eight months in, I witnessed my first murder here at San Quentin. ROBINSON: And, so, then you know it's a very, very serious place. San Quentin is the oldest prison in the state of California. It's about 20 miles north of San Francisco. We've been here on this site since July of 1852. For about 130 of those years, San Quentin was a maximum-security facility... ROBINSON: ...in that everyone who lived at San Quentin, they were here for really violent crimes, and they did a lot of time. A lot of what happened here was based upon medieval practices to torture people. The thought process at that time, "If you break a person, you'll get a person to change." ROBINSON: Today, we normally house about 4,400 inmates here at this prison. And our first mission, of course, is we house death row. (door closes) In the state of California, if a person is sentenced to death, if they're a male inmate, they're going to be housed at San Quentin State Prison, period. (indistinct conversations) ROBINSON: Our secondary mission is what we call our general population. One day, the doors open for them. ROBINSON: Whether they earn it through the parole board or they were sentenced to a definitive amount of time, once they reach that date, they leave. And we're allowed to do things a little differently... ROBINSON: ...in terms of providing rehabilitative services and access to the outside world. MAN: What we going to do today is, man, we're gonna talk about what's the impact on the victims from our crimes. ROBINSON: We believe that we have guys leaving prison today with better outcomes and more hope for the future. Given the opportunity, there are people who can come to prison and reclaim the man. ♪♪ ROBINSON: And that's evolved to today where we have sports activities that are beyond just the normal prison fare, and I think the flagship right now is our basketball team and the partnership that's developed from that with the Golden State Warriors.

And for those dreams to be derailed, to come in and have a opportunity to prove to themselves that, "I could have made it," that, "I was that good," is huge. That's what they really playing for. Some of these guys missed they calling. They should have been on a Division I basketball team. But for whatever reason, they didn't make it. So then they come in here, and they find out that there is a legitimate basketball program where you're going to play somebody from the coaching staff of the Golden State Warriors at the end of the season.

Yes, sir. - 'Cause it's similar to what you said how Simon was -- He was just walking by. He said, "No. You going to help Jesus carry this cross." - Yes, sir. - Jesus can help us - carry our cross just as well. - Yes, he can. - Amen. - Yes, he can. - Amen. - Yes, he can.

Here comes Blaine behind -- Oh, Dan with the excellent move, all the way to the rim. Count it, and we got a timeout by the Warriors right there, and they need it.

The final score is 90 Imago Dei... That's horrible. ...84 San Quentin Warriors. The Warriors right now are 3-4. We got a coach that's coming in with a new system. Nice defense. MAN: When losses start piling up, the coach gets the blame, fairly and unfairly. MAN #2: I know he wants people to buy into, "It's bigger than basketball. Let's share this. Let's share this opportunity." But if you're not winning, nobody's gon' buy into it. TAYLOR: Clay put it down hard, backs it back out. Pass goes over to Jasper. Jasper -- Oh, good dime, drop-off, and a bucket. You, stop bringing your man to the ball. TAYLOR: Feed the ball into Neil McDeal, another high-arcer, another assist. If they juice themselves up to think that they're better than they are, and then the team comes down the hill and starts smacking you around on the court, you can sit over here on the sideline and get down. This is our court. You have to go out here, step on this court like you the baddest team on the planet, and take it from the opponent.

CUEVAS: We ain't losing nothing. We got this. Let's go. ALL: Warriors! TAYLOR: The crowd is getting antsy. This game can go either way right now. The Missile brings it up, just Davis on him again. MAN: Go to work, boy. TAYLOR: Feed the ball out to the Phenom. MAN: Make a move, Harry! TAYLOR: Comes the Phenom with the ball. - Wow! - Good move, man! - Yeah! - The franchise is back! CUEVAS: Nice move, Harry! He can't hold you! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's finish this, man. Come on, man. TAYLOR: 14 seconds on the clock, 13. 13, 12, 11... There's a double-team. Turnover right there. Here comes the Phenom on the move. The Phenom puts it up and in. (cheers and applause) Give it up for the San Quentin Warriors with the score 93 to 88. This is a back-to-back victory. Nobody has ever won back-to-back. ♪♪ - Good game, man. - Thank you. (indistinct conversations) Last one, huh? CUEVAS: You know, we had ups and downs the whole season, but some of the guys has worked really hard for this moment. PRODUCER: How do you feel about ATL? Of course I'm going to miss him. Hey, if we can, fellas, let's get in a circle! I'm very happy to see him leaving prison, and I'm only going to miss him for a while because I'm going to chase you out of here, but go ahead, Harry. (light cheers and applause) Man, I don't know what to say, man. I'm at a loss for words, man. It's bittersweet. Definitely with this program, it's been huge in my life, man. It was the first time I played, you know, up under a coach, man, that was really more concerned with character-building, you know, and teaching life skills through the sport of basketball, so I learned a lot in here, more than I probably would've ever learned playing basketball on the streets, man, so I definitely appreciate you, man. Y'all really my family, bro. You know what I mean? All of y'all, bro, I'm going to miss y'all, man. MAN: Stand together. Stand together. Give it up for ATL! CUEVAS: Give it up for ATL! (applause) (indistinct conversations) CUEVAS: He's ending on this high note, but I hope it is not his last game in a Warriors jersey. That's how I feel. Kent and I want to talk to you real quick. All right. Last year, you asked me about the G League tryout. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we happen to have a tryout next Sunday. It's a private workout. I'm not just inviting you because. HARRY: Yeah. Like, it's going to be real players out there. It's going to be tough, so you're going to have a short period of time to get ready for it. - All right? - Yeah. But if you still want to do it, we got a spot for you. Definitely, definitely. I'm going to work my behind off, man. - I got you. - All right. - Yes, sir. - No promises. You're going to have to earn the training-camp spot. No, no, no. I'm... Yeah, yeah. - All right. - No, no. Yes, sir. - See you next Sunday then. - Yes, sir. Okay. Hit me up when you get out. - I will. - Then we'll talk. (indistinct conversations) They did it too, bro. They said, "Sunday." (both laugh) - That's what I'm talking about. - Yeah.

(camera shutter clicks) ♪♪ JACKSON: So, wow, this day is finally here. - Yeah. - Yeah. And can I just say how proud I am of everything that you've done? HARRY: I'm going to be all right. I can make a declaration right now to you that I'm going to do the right thing, and I'm going to live right, and I'm going to walk and live according to the standard that you poured into me and that you showed me. That's serious, and I love you so much, and I just want to make you proud, and I hope I do that. You will. I know that you will. Thank you, ATL. - All right, Mom. - Thank you. Okay. (sniffles) ♪♪ ROBINSON: There is a need in prisons to have a place where you put bad, bad guys who want to do bad, bad things, to keep those guys separated from other people. But also it has to be a place that offers people the opportunity to reclaim themselves. (indistinct conversations) The perception is that, once a guy is in prison, he's locked away, and you won't have to deal with him no more, but that's not necessarily true. I'll see you out there. We'll hang out. And we hooping. And we going to get... For sure, we going to put our team together, our own together. ROBINSON: In the state of California, nearly 90% of the people who are incarcerated, they're returned to the community, and they live next to you. They're passing you on the sidewalk in the city. And so how do you want the guy to return? Do you want a guy who's been locked away in the box with bad, bad dudes and honing in bad, bad dude skills? Or do you want a guy who we've given all the opportunities to educate himself, to gain some employable skills, to figure out where he went wrong? How do you want a guy to return? Really appreciate you, bro, from day one since I got off. Like I told you, you the first person to give me my first pair of basketball shoes, bro. I'm praying to God, brother, that they let you up out of here, man. Either way, we do good work in here. We done changed the life that we live. - Yeah. - And now, just day to day, just take advantage of the blessings that are here. HARRY: Yeah. - I love you. - I love you too, bro. ROBINSON: Hope has real currency inside of a person. Man, just to have just some of it, it means a lot. ♪♪ ♪♪ CUEVAS: Today, I've been incarcerated 13 years for the murder of Timothy Griffith. I'm expecting to go to the Board of Parole at the end of the year. REDMAN: I do believe that people can change. I really do. I also believe that there's something about a person who can take another person's life, and I don't know if that can change, and I believe that there should be programs in jails and in prisons to help people, but that's what it should do is help you while you remain in prison. ♪♪ CUEVAS: Today, I feel great deals of guilt and regret and shame around my actions that night and other incidents where I was extremely violent in my life. I know I won't get those moments back, and in my present, I'm afforded great opportunity. I feel a big responsibility to reach out to people that are in similar situations because I feel like if I can reach somebody like me, then I can save somebody like Timothy, and if I can reach somebody that looks like me and save them from themselves, then that's my responsibility. It's not an opportunity for me.
