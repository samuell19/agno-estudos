MARK: To me, the definition of adventure is to be facing an uncertain future, where you have a strong hand in guiding your own fate. And I just love that idea. That's why I love adventure and that's why I love stories like the Franklin mystery. Arctic explorer John Franklin set off from England in 1845 with two ships and 128 men. Trying to be the first to make it through the Northwest Passage. A new trade route up over the top of the world and they disappeared, without a trace. 129 guys, vanished into the ether. And in the years since, more than 100 expeditions have gone to the Arctic to try to figure out what happened. And nobody has been able to figure it out. There are clues about what happened, and I think I have figured out a way to solve this mystery once and for all. ♪ ♪ (theme music plays) ♪ ♪ The Franklin expedition spent their first winter at a place called Beechey Island, which is sort of the entrance to the Northwest Passage. In 1984, a team went up there to investigate three graves, for three of Franklin's men. MAN (over film): Oh, look at the discoloration in there. Careful. There is something else, look at that. MARK: And they exhumed the three bodies. MAN (over film): Meltwater next. Lot of ice in there. MARK: They were frozen solid into ice. MAN (over film): You could see how his face was desiccated, and the mummified, the soft tissues have diminished in volume. MARK: For me, the most compelling thing about that story is the images of Franklin's men, and they're haunting. MAN (over film): Oh, look at that hand. That is really well preserved. Now this sort of thing has never been seen before. This is absolutely unique. MARK: I don't think there's anybody who could see those pictures and not be moved by it, and to be thinking about what that must have been like to die that first winter up in the Arctic. Sub-zero, there's polar bears. The level of suffering and like how grim and scary it must have gotten. 129 guys. So not a single one of them made it out to tell the tale of what happened. Imagine if someone that you cared about deeply disappeared. You know, imagine like, if your son or your daughter or your brother or your sister disappeared. Would you be okay with that? Or would you become consumed with wanting to know what happened? And there's people out there who are still trying to figure it out and trying to solve it. TOM: The Franklin mystery is a puzzle. You know, it it's a puzzle with the pieces missing. So we've got to try and not only put together what we've got, but we've got to try and recreate some of those pieces and fit them together. MARK: Tom has dedicated the better part of his adult life to trying to solve the Franklin mystery. In particular, he has focused on trying to find the tomb of John Franklin. He considers that to be the holy grail of the Franklin mystery, because Franklin would have been buried with his papers, the ship's papers, the ship's log. You know, a commander in the British Royal Navy, every day he's going to be keeping a diary. And those papers could potentially solve the mystery as to what happened to Franklin and his men. TOM: In 2014, I thought, well there's still one more chance of maybe finding it. And that is doing an aerial survey with the airplane. I was looking down at the ground, I saw what looked like large rocks, very large rocks. And it was a perfect engineered, rectangle shaped structure. So I circled around to try and get a better look at it. And we never found it again. It just sort of vanished. And we've been looking for it ever since. MARK: Tom has seen the tomb from the air. And he's been closing in on it ever since. He didn't get GPS coordinates at the time. And he's been eliminating territory. And now we're down to less than 30 square miles. So all that's left now, is to go to King William Island, to meet up with Tom and see if we can find the tomb. ♪ ♪ RENAN: Feels surprisingly chill today for like, pre-launch. MARK: The reason why it feels surprisingly chill is because I put a year of my life into making sure that today felt surprisingly chill. (laughs). My investigative process is to immerse myself in the story as much as I possibly can. And, in this case, to do that, I want to follow in the wake of Franklin's two ships, the Erebus and the Terror. And so I want to sail there in my own boat. I want to intersect with Franklin's route. I want to go to the same places that they went. And I want to see it with my own eyes and I want to feel it. BEN: He called me and he's like, "Hey, man, what do you think about?", you know, he talks so slow. "What would you think about going up to the Northwest Passage on a boat?" (laughs). I was like, "Yeah man, if you're on the trip I'll go" because if anyone can get it done, it's Mark. ♪ ♪ RENAN: First sail, getting her up! ♪ ♪ BEN: One for Renan here. RENAN: Thank you, sir. BEN: Sorry about the tin plate but we're on an expedition. RENAN: I've been doing adventures with Mark for over 15 years now, and, I grew up sailing but if I'm too seasick, I'm probably just going to be curled up in fetal position and be relying on, on Rudy to get everything. MARK: There's no one out here, no other ships. It's all about this ship, it's all about the Polar Sun taking care of us. She's a good vessel. I care deeply about adventure and exploration and history. That's been kind of the compass bearing leading me through life since I was a little kid. And I've turned that into my livelihood. I led an expedition on Mount Everest to search for the body of lost explorer, Sandy Irvine. I climbed these crazy cliffs in the Amazon to search for new species of animals. One, two, three! And if you're part of this world, you eventually have friends that go out on expeditions and they never come home. And when that happens, when people disappear, it's just our human nature to want to know what happened. And that's kind of what this project is all about for me, to potentially add like a final chapter to the story. Sir John Franklin was a seasoned Arctic explorer. At age 59, he bid farewell to his wife and daughter and set sail for the Arctic. In the Spring of 1845, Franklin's ships were last seen off the coast of Greenland. When the ships disappeared, a trail of clues was discovered on the remote King William Island, including a written record found in 1859. The Victory Point document states that Franklin's ships had become completely trapped in ice. The men has abandoned ship and set out on King William Island. A second entry made almost a year later, tells us that 24 crew had died, including Captain Franklin. Franklin's two ships were finally discovered off the coast of King William Island in 2014 and 2016. But the lost tomb of Franklin himself is still out there, waiting to be found. Our first task is crossing the Labrador sea to link up with Franklin's route at a place called the Whale Fish Islands. BEN: Woo hoo! MARK: So grim! Oh wow this is not... this is not inviting, this is not exactly paradise. (ship creaking) RENAN: What is up with that house? BEN: Oh, that's cool! Someone's hunting, hunting lodge. Oh there's several, you see? MARK: So cool, so cool. The Whale Fish Islands. It's taken us 2,200 miles of sailing from Maine just to get to the beginning of this journey. This is where Franklin set off for the Northwest Passage in 1845. This was a town. Some kind of a whaling station. Totally abandoned now. Look at this. This is what I've been looking for right here. An iron bollard in the shore, where Franklin tied up their ships. And this was the last anchorage for the Franklin expedition before they set off into the Northwest Passage. At that time, sailing over the top of the world wouldn't have been too different from the idea of going to the moon. You know, in terms of the history of exploration, there's nothing more epic. You know, almost like a Knights of the Round table kind of thing to try to make it through there. It's wild to realize that Franklin and his men were walking all around here and preparing for their voyage into the Northwest Passage. From here, the ice gauntlet begins. We just sailed into a fog bank. This is really really thick. So I can see about a boat length and the water is filled with chunks of ice. The radar shows the big stuff, it shows the bergs, but it doesn't show the small stuff. It doesn't show the growlers, and the growlers could tear the boat in half. Crossing the maze of ice bergs in Baffin Bay was the first real test Franklin and his men faced on their voyage into the unknown. This is part of the reason why I wanted to sail to King William Island, to be faced with some of the same decision points that Franklin was 175 years ago. It was the most modern, the most well-equipped expedition in the history of the world at that point. And they disappeared without a trace. The best way to describe kind of what it's like out there is I would call it a savage wilderness. Oh! BEN: There it goes! Oh man, look at it bouncing! ♪ ♪ MARK: We can see land! Woo hoo! I have to say, I really like the place where the land and sea meet. Especially when there's mountains involved. ♪ ♪ After crossing Baffin Bay in the fall of 1845, Franklin's ships anchored for the winter at a tiny island in the middle of nowhere called Beechey Island. When the expedition went missing, some of the first clues were discovered on Beechey Island as well as the bodies of three of Franklin's crew. The autopsy showed I think, that all three of them died from tuberculosis, maybe a combination of that and pneumonia. But no new answers were discovered about what happened to the rest of Franklin's men. If we find Franklin's tomb, not only do we find the remains of a legendary lost explorer but we probably also find his papers. TOM: There's going to be all sorts of information in there. There'll be photographs. We're going to maybe have letters that are written from the crew members to be sent back home. It provides their story to the world. MARK: Polar Sun is really in her element right now, moving fast, just absolutely perfect conditions. We were sailing full speed toward King William Island and then we got news about a brewing storm. (thunder) A southeast gale that was building and we're heading southeast. BEN: Well, what we're faced with is we can either go into a really good bailout option where we can hole up for a couple days while all the weather blows overhead, or we can carry on into some dicey ice, and then hope that we make it somewhere safe before the weather descends. The thing is, we have to make our decision within the next two or three hours whether we turn into Pasley Bay or carry on, because we're getting to we're getting to decision point. MARK: The ice is down here. People speculate that's what happened to Franklin. Franklin came right down to here, got to the decision point. Didn't think he could go this way, so we went here into Victoria Strait which, it doomed them. They got caught in the ice and they never got out. BEN: Do we go left? We go right? Do we wait? It's the tension of Arctic navigation that we have to deal with. 20 feet ahead, so we should get ready. MARK: What do you got for depth? BEN: 25 feet. MARK: It made sense, to go into Pasley and to ride out the storm. We've done well, now it's just a waiting game to sit and wait and see what happens. ♪ ♪ The storm came in overnight. Ice had come in and had encircled the entrance to the bay. A giant crescent of ice, capping the whole thing off. ♪ ♪ We are officially trapped within an impenetrable wall of ice. BEN: We've found a little spot where there might be some shelter but we can't get much closer to shore because we only have 19 feet of water at this point. MARK: Watch out! Don't go into that little nook. RUDY: Alright Ben, we're good to go back. You got a piece drifting. RENAN: We just barely escaped that little narrow gap that was closing in on us. Really close call. MARK: Getting trapped in the ice was the thing that I had always been the most afraid of. I mean I've read all these stories about this happening to explorers and having their boats being crushed in the ice. It's really a bad situation to be in. I'm gonna rely on my gut a little bit more than I have been, and my gut is telling me that we need to conserve every type of fuel that we have. BEN: Even if we're in this bay for two weeks, we're getting to Gjoa. There's no way we're not. MARK: I mean, well, there is a way that we're not which is that that plug of ice there never leaves the bay. It could happen, and it's 35 degrees out there right now. Strangely enough we have now gotten ourselves stranded not far from where Franklin did and 175 years later and it's like still a pretty serious situation. We know from the Victory Point record that Franklin's ships, the Erebus and the Terror, became completely frozen into the ice. The note gave exact coordinates for where they were abandoned, but the ships continued drifting and then disappeared. In the years that followed, eyewitness testimony was gathered from local Inuit hunters about sightings of the abandoned ships and Franklin's men. I think the most interesting part of the story is that the Inuit knew all along where the ships were, and it wasn't until they finally listened to the Inuit that they found the ships, 175 years later. MAN (over film): Here we are, at the stern of the ship. MARK: Researchers discovered a trove of perfectly preserved artifacts but no human remains have been found. The Inuit sightings also match up perfectly with where Tom Gross believes he saw Franklin's tomb in 2015. TOM: I'm pretty positive that that's what we saw that day. And if it is what I saw, we are going to have records that are in pristine condition because they're going to be frozen along with a frozen-in-time John Franklin. MARK: We've been in Pasley Bay for eight days, it would be kind of enjoyable if it wasn't just high stress all day every day. Okay starboard! You're going over a big chunk! Okay get me an ice screw. Ooh boy, they're not gonna go in that well. We started anchoring to the floating chunks of ice to try to avoid getting the anchor trapped under the ice. RENAN: I don't know why it feels like the end of the expedition, but it's only the middle. It's because we were supposed to be 1,000 miles from here right now. Let's keep fighting the good fight. BEN: Back up, right into it. MARK: Okay take this back real quick. Go back. Just go, yep, go hard back. Get a line ready, toss me a line and get me an ice screw! It's extremely demoralizing when I see that this is the only place in this entire area, in this whole Gulf of Boothia where there's ice right now, and so I'm feeling like we made some bad decisions. ♪ ♪ RENAN: After being stuck here for eight days, the ice is slowly starting to break apart. The pieces are crumbling, and there's a chance we might break free. MARK: It was like, "Start the engine. We're going to do this. Let's see what happens." RUDY: Go 20-30 feet and then you're gonna turn to starboard. BEN: Got it! RUDY: Good on that course, keep that heading. BEN: We have 16 feet under the keel right now! (scraping) MARK: Ooh, that was a (bleep) hard one. RUDY: More! More to port, more! MARK: Yep, slower Ben. BEN: I see clear water man! It's like no ice in the water just a quarter mile ahead. We just have to get through this last little crux. RENAN: Just go straight. There's this concentrated chunk around the point, and then, seems like we might be home free. BEN: Renan's at the masthead parting the ice like Moses so we can get through! RENAN: Nice. MARK: Holy (bleep). Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I cannot (bleep) believe it. We're in open water, boys. Full sail, sun, Gjoa Haven here we come! Polar Sun is pulling in. This is incredible. I can't believe we're finally here. Today is day 87, we've sailed 3600 nautical miles. We've seen ice, we've seen fog, we've seen graves of people who didn't make it out of here. We've been through a lot. Woo! Holy (bleep). This is a very strange feeling. Civilization. Wow, we've got the Northwest Passage right there and then a cell tower right there. (laughs). When we finally arrived, Tom Gross was right there waiting for us, ready to go. (laughs). RENAN: It's been a long, long journey. TOM: I thought we were gonna have to leave without ya! (laughs). MARK: Wow, can't believe I'm finally here. TOM: Yeah, this bedroom here, it kind of converted into my Franklin research room. MARK: This is the command center. TOM: There's something with this mystery I mean, every time I am ready to give up on it, which has been a few times in 28 years, something happens. Something happens that sucks me right back in where I've got to go back out and look for it. This picture is 1994, March. This is a friend of mine who passed away Louie Kamookak, and when I first was introduced to him, they said, "This is Louie Kamookak and uh, Louie's got the same interests that you have, Tom," and so we hit it off right away. We started talking about different theories, different ideas. He told me about things that were found around the island. Louie's dream was always to find that place, the Franklin site. And it looks a lot like what I've drawn here for you. MARK: You saw this from the air? TOM: And then we saw it. Yes, exactly. Yeah. MARK: But you didn't get the GPS coordinates? TOM: No, we didn't get the GPS. MARK: That's why we're down to 30 square miles. TOM: That's right. MARK: That we're going to cover? TOM: Yeah. If we can find the stone structure that we saw from the air, I'm sure we're going to have the burial tomb of Sir John Franklin. MARK: I'm honored that I have the opportunity to go there and do this with you. I can't even believe this is happening. Like, just the chance to possibly find something that could solve this mystery is, that's a once in a lifetime opportunity. We're going to pack up and we're going to head out in the morning first thing on the four-wheelers to try to find Franklin's tomb. TOM: You know, I've been doing this for such a long time. I have a really good feeling we're going to find it. And I've never had this feeling the way I've got it on this trip. There's only one hill where it can be, and I am almost positive that it's there. You know, it's always the last minute stuff. You don't want to be forgetting anything now. Because once we're out there, if we don't have it, we don't have it. MARK: It's a rugged, 80 mile journey from the port in Gjoa Haven to our search zone. Tom had all the bikes lined up outside the house where we were staying, and I realized, "Wow, you know what? I don't think I've actually ridden one of these things before". TOM: Just follow where we're going. Cause we're going to be going through and finding a good path, and then where we go through, you follow us. MARK: Okay. TOM: And you're gonna want to be cautious all the time. MARK: Jacob, stay close to me please. JACOB: Yes. (laughs). ♪ ♪ MARK: The overland expedition is going to be our chance to solve this mystery once and for all. TOM: Traveling up to the search area is really incredibly difficult. It's long, it's rough. There's a lot of bog you have to cross. RENAN: This is normal? TOM: Yeah. (laughs). It's fairly risky going out there. There's probably nobody better than Jacob that knows this island. JACOB: My role on the expedition is to make sure that we all come back home safely at the end of the trip. MARK: I think I should go back. Not Jacob's first rodeo. ♪ ♪ What in the (bleep)? You've gotta be... come on! Not off the most auspicious start here. ♪ ♪ TOM: The tundra has something that nowhere else in the world has. It's hard to really describe. You can see for miles and miles all around you. MARK: There's no one out here taking care of you other than yourself. It hits home in a sort of a sobering way, what it must have been like for Franklin and his men to be out here, because you're in the middle of nowhere. Over the years, human remains from the Franklin expedition have been discovered across King William Island. In 1854, an Inuit hunter reported finding the bones of 30 men piled together, some with signs of cannibalism. JIMMY: I really believe that, you know, if Franklin and his men had help from the Inuit people around this area, with their traditional clothing, and with the hunting, and the skills that they had, I think they would've made it through the Northwest Passage. I always thought that Franklin himself didn't want any assistance, cause I really believe that he wanted to do it on his own without the help of the Inuit people. Their nomadic life would have shown them that yes, these areas are safe to travel by. TOM: This is it. MARK: Wow. TOM: Boot camp. This is Collinson River, and Collinson Inlet. MARK: Wow. TOM: We made it. MARK: Really cool. Tom targeted Collinson Inlet based on Inuit testimony about a Franklin campsite in this area. TOM: The first winter when they arrived, I think that they ended up down in here. So hopefully, what we can do is prove that they did and that we'll find a camp out here somewhere, and if that's correct, we should be able to find the tomb of Sir John Franklin in this area as well. MARK: Wow. (speaking native language) JACOB: Let the day have good weather. RENAN: We're about to launch the fixed wing drone. This has been a long term dream to get this thing in the air. They use these drones to, to map the tundra, to look at changes in the climate, but we're using it to map a high resolution area to try to find the tomb. RUDY: Look at that, shows the airplane on the map. We've got greens. RENAN: Yeah! (laughs). TOM: This area right here. This is what I want to see. MARK: Right around there, right? TOM: Yeah. MARK: So let's get the drone up in the air and let's get you pretending that the drone is in you in the plane, seven years ago. We could recreate like how it was for you that day, back in 2015. TOM: Perfect. Let's try it. MARK: We're going to very carefully document this ridge, because this really is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If Rudy wasn't here, do you think you could get this all set up? TOM: No. (laughs). I couldn't even open up the computer. MARK: You basically just create sort of a grid over what you want to search, and then the plane just shoots sequential photographs that are designed so that they all interlink. RENAN: So we're at 600 feet now. You just direct me where to go. TOM: This hill. Can you go right to there? RENAN: Yeah. Want me to go down into it? TOM: Yep. Go right down into. RENAN: I'm going down in. TOM: You see that island right there? There's an island. RENAN: Way out there? TOM: Way out there. So I saw that, I was looking right at that. MARK: You bring the plane back, you download the imagery, and then the software stitches them all together in one of these gigapan giant photos. RUDY: Ooh. File is done. Look, the quality of the stitch is incredible. I mean, you can zoom in. RENAN: This is the zone. RUDY: Each white block represents a separate photo of what we covered. MARK: That's amazing. RUDY: About 1300 photos went into that. TOM: You see that? This is the area. There's no question in my mind. This is the area. MARK: Tom's adamant about what he saw in 2015. He has seen the tomb from the air. Finding it again is all about, "Where did Franklin land when they left the ships? Where was that camp?" You find that camp, you find Franklin's tomb. ♪ ♪ We just hauled across that flood plain. Heading to the area that Tom identified. I parked the bike. I got off. There were these interesting looking rocks arranged in an unnatural way. Look at the size of these rocks. What the hell. Come on. Holy (bleep). What the hell is that? Hey Tom! This is a camp. That's incredible. TOM: That's a tent peg. MARK: Come on. You've got to be kidding me. TOM: Tent peg. MARK: Is that something they would have had on the ships... TOM: Yeah. MARK: Or something they would have made? TOM: Well they would have made them probably. It was really, really exciting in a sense that I was looking for a camp and what did we find, but a tent peg. You know, I think we found it within the first 40 minutes of, of going out, which was incredible. You know, like that just doesn't happen. MARK: I think we should look around here a little bit more. And this? Come on! TOM: Oh wow, eh? Look at that. Look at this. RENAN: That's not Inuit is it, Jacob? JACOB: This one? Not it's not. There were some items there that our ancestors cannot make, such as the brass rod and the tent peg. It could have been a camp at one time from the expedition. MARK: We have Inuit testimony saying that there's a stone house and a camp in this area. Now, we have found artifacts that support the idea that these stories are true. And we have Tom seeing a stone house that perfectly fits the description in 2015. So we felt like we were close. I mean, it was just like right there, we're going to find it. Okay, so, the weather's perfect. We're getting close. Let's keep going. TOM: Let's keep going. That's a nice hill. Yeah, straight there. I don't know how far away it is but that looks really, really good. MARK: This is our window to find the tomb, before the weather turns. The idea is to search ridge lines that match the one Tom saw from the plane back in 2015. I mean imagine finding Franklin's diary. We might be able to change history. TOM: Oh I think we're close, this is the area. I think that hill over there, you know, it's just, it's just the lighting, throws things off. There's one more hill up here that I've marked, and we should go to that one. For me, like until I find that stone thing that I saw, I'm not going to be able to rest. You know I need to see that, I need to see what it was and put that to rest. MARK: Keep going down. TOM: Yeah, I know, yeah. MARK: There's all these big, black, pointy rocks on that one. I guess today is day five or six. We've covered I think about 400 miles so far. But we haven't found any new signs of Franklin's men. Did it not have little lakes on the side Tom? TOM: No, there's no lakes on it. MARK: It would be on this side, right Tom? TOM: Yeah. RENAN: Yeah, cut out. It's like transmission lost. It cut out again! TOM: How are you feeling Jacob? Are you feeling good about finding it still? JACOB: I never lose hope until we start heading home. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ MARK: What the heck? The drain plug on the oil pan had just fallen off. RENAN: Do you want me to take this bag off too? Jacob to the rescue. Took Jacob 20 minutes to find a piece of driftwood. And it's, it's holding all the oil on the bike right now, but I don't know how many miles we have. (engine rumbling). MARK: We spent eight days driving up and down these gravel eskers. I mean, just going around in circles and up and down. And we went from this really high running optimism, like we are close, like, we are right on the trail. And then it was just... Day after day of frustration, of driving through this incredibly rugged terrain that was destroying the bikes. And we were spending half of every day fixing the bikes. ♪ ♪ We got to a certain point where, you know, a week into searching, there was nowhere else to look. ♪ ♪ We were in Erebus Bay which is the spot where 23 of Franklin crew died. There were signs of cannibalism and bones that had these cut marks. And that's the spot where we know things got really desperate. There may be some Inuit who know where Franklin is buried, but they don't want to mess with it because there's a very strong taboo in their culture against messing around with the dead. JIMMY: We, as Inuit people, still believe that there are spirits that are out there. They're lost, and still trying to find their way home. But for me, we should study these things to understand what happened. And we can pass this story on to our next generation. MARK: We did the best that we could to document some of the main search areas. I mean, we have that data now. We've been looking at it. We can continue to look at it. I could see that being the future of finding Franklin's tomb. TOM: I know what I saw in 2015. I think that we're very, very close to finding it. I think that it's going to be found probably within the next year or two. And not just not just Franklin, who will basically be frozen in time, but maybe a couple other officers with him. And also it's going to be where the records are buried as well. So I think it's all together, it's once we find one thing, we're going to have it all and it's just, just a matter of time and it'll be there. ♪ ♪ MARK: I know that the mystery of the Franklin expedition is gonna continue to suck people into it's vortex. His grave is somewhere out there right now. Somebody's gonna find it someday. And solve the Franklin mystery once and for all.
