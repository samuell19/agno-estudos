Myope? It's time to wake up! Get up everyday, wash everyday. Drink your tea and have a smoke to take on life. Do the dishes everyday. That makes your nails grow, so there's something to bite on. But I'm fed up. I'm going on strike! You just have to do it. And I'm fed up with eating and grocery shopping too! And reading the paper and everything that's print! Even smoking! I'm going on strike. Here, read. You'll save your saliva. The Noise of Time? Are you crazy? This is banned. And I'll ban others: work, projects, vacation. If you keep being destructive, you'll end up in boarding school! No, not boarding school! So, do me a favor and make up something pronto! It's set in Paris... Here and now. It's hot. There's a boy. There's a boy. He is. - Pierrot! It's hot. The asphalt sticks to the sandal soles. And the wind moves the awnings above the cafe terraces. And the boy stands up and goes to the window. I love life. That's no story. It isn't about anything. You're boring me. Go knock yourself out. I love you. You're my better half. I don't care. Pity! Don't worry, I can't see anything. At least lower the volume. At least lower the volume. You already said that. A good thing is worth repeating. That's true for everything but life. Girl, you're not a cat. You only have one life. Even if it's the wrong one. At best, if you weren't you, you'd be me. Don't talk about misfortune. - What if you weren't me or you? What would you do would-be Scheherazade? I could, I would, I would be, I'd do. I speak Arabic and live in Cairo. I'm on a boat leaving the port at Valparaiso. That the guy in the hat looks at obstinately in the photo. I'm you and I, my Spanish orange. I'm the people on the street. I'm the people's daddy, not its brothers... uh, sister. I'm the father of the boy with the bright smile. And the brunette locking up her big bike. Pierrot! Who is it? Go see, someone's knocking. It's open. It's open! She insists. What's she doing here? She'll mix everything up with her Babylonian eyes. I was here earlier. He's been there three days. I've been here three days. Paulina Orel, her again. Look after it. I'm swimming in happiness. I'm swimming in happiness. Promising. I'd like to be quartered. Let's going out. Let's go out. Go not going. Those your only shoes? That's not how you'll seduce women you see in the press. In the beginning, this striking boy, my lovely creature, returns from a trip to his home country. I like his hidden gestures and obscure desires. He rediscovers his adopted city and adopted sister. It's very hot. And worse, the asphalt sticks to the sandal soles and when it's windy, the awnings above the cafe terraces... - You're repeating yourself. I'm rambling. I'm so stupid. You, for example, you are intelligent, What makes you say that? Instead of asking why I call you smart? What makes me say I'm stupid is that I know everything, I'm 1000 years old. Even at five, I knew the revolutions since that's what it's called, from the earth. I knew the tectonic folds. I could recognizes cuestas and the Pliocene. I've forgotten all that, but I still know everything and I don't know what to do about it to affect the world. Even on a tiny bit of the world. Earlier, I showered and... - That's normal. Stop cutting me off. Suddenly, and remember there was no reason for this, I wasn't calm. I was very calm. As if... - Paradisaical at the limit of paradise. And instead of staying still, I asked myself what was happening. Understand? I could have rediscovered this peace when I'd need it. I was stingy, which chased it away, of course, dissolved it in the shower water. He went about it wrong. - You went about it wrong. Wound and anger, desire and combat. I went about it wrong. Ever noticed, sometimes you wake up beautiful, then you wash and are ugly? You know? Yes. It's like looking at something you love... It's like looking at something you love... a painting, a landscape, the city you've just left, to remember it, to enjoy it as much as possible, but the longer you look, the more it flees. Too bad. For paradise, it's fine. No surprise... The Seine, for example. You cross a bridge in the evenings to the west is the sea, so you stop and try to see the sea and there's only water. You're kidding. It was even better than that. I know but that's it. - You always know everything. I don't know. It is up to them to grow without danger... Everyone in this city talks about the same things. Shut up and listen. Please listen. It was like this where I lived before. On the left was the pond for hearing it was raining. On the right, the ravine of the wild woman ...whose only meaning is to exist and be as beautiful as trees... I'm something of a god, but more of a creative god. I'm modern. Since I keep people alive just by thinking of them. For example, do you think you'd go on living if I didn't see you? Anyway, even if I didn't see you, I'd still think of you. So don't worry. Will you teach me your foreign language? First, it's not a foreign language. It's my native language. And just learn another one. There are plenty. Excuse me, ma'am. Sorry, it's all I can offer. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. Bye. He really breaks my balls with his constant bla bla. Say that again. - I only repeat what I don't understand. A little. Tighten your butt and suck in your stomach at the same time. You need to push with your arms. Push against the ground. I'm still waiting... How many will we be in ten years? What time was it ten minutes ago?? - May 3, 2007? And ten years after May 3, 2007 will be? You're a pain, leave me alone. Give me another round! Do you still see your colleague? He's on cloud nine with a girl from Lyon. Sorry, I'm late. Sorry, I'm late. Stop coughing, it's annoying. Funny. Pierrot sounds familiar. Didn't we meet him somewhere? It's already escaping... - Who is this Pierrot? My hero. The boy in the cafe here. Which one? - The one with an accent. I was waiting in the restaurant alone. And you aren't even late. So shut up. If that's how it is, I'm going. See, you never believe me. For the radiator, no big deal. Just close it with soap. Speaking of the radiator, how's my sister? She still yours? She's on cloud nine. This Pierrot, didn't we meet him in 1977 in Portofino? No, that was Raul. We spent the day pretending to fish on the edge of the dock. With fishing poles that I don't think we even attached hooks to. It isn't Jean? Admitting that he began calling himself Jean then. The one in the square, who threw the tickets of his proletarian organization in the air. He quickly tried picking them up, but we were amusingly impressed. Of course not! That guy was French, and a boss. You only recall the bosses, not the small fries. No, he reminds me of the foreign sailor we met in Toulon when we ran away with Ani. Plus, I already said, he has an accent. What's the point of your lenses? You don't look at people or see anything. You're just interested in yourself. You joker! There was an elevator. Hey - How are you? Didn't you mention a girl? - She's dead. She couldn't come. Doesn't matter. Gaspard Ossipovitch Mandelstam. Sorry? - Man-del-stam. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. Listen dear, you have an unheard of chance. No, I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. Yes? No. No, I'm not here. Yes! You can't refuse that. Initial here and here. And sign here. Okay. Here. Do you see? Do you see these two or three brutes with the world in their hands and in their ignorance believe they are the smartest in the universe? Don't worry. Let's go. - No, no. Don't worry because in their extreme happiness, they view as heretics everyone who isn't a donkey like them. I've made good progress with your phrase. It's not my phrase. It's 1000 years old. Plus, in 1000 years, these two or three have had kids. They are everyone now. We just need to have a revolution, like before. No one says that anymore. You'll get your head cut off. Stop coughing, it's hurting me. - At least, we'd take our time. The cats here fuck more than I do. Pros work with headphones on. What's monstrous about love is that desire has no limits and action is a slave to limits. Willpower is infinite and execution is restrained. I don't know... For life. Second solution: Question 3: a lifeguard on the beach invites you out. I'd say no. And you? I'd accept. Question 4: He's 45 minutes late to your date. Being so happy should be forbidden. The time to die is now or never. This just has to work. This would just have to work. It would just have to... Some people who are in their place here. If you could get rid of me, you'd find yourself in your place. But I am in my place. I've known that since returning from Switzerland. I was delighted by the smell of piss at the train station. Right, we're not the most unhappy. As if that were consolation. Don't cry. I'm not crying, I'm protesting. You remind me of a beggar who starts to hate alms because he's heard of a wonderful treasure, one that doesn't exist. My dear, happiness comes in fragments at different moments. Bye! - Bye! To the shower! You have no imagination. No. No what? Yes. I have no imagination. You indifferent little... You aren't even interested in my pebble juice. In my country, there's a story about a giant like that. Know it? They tell the same stories everywhere. Tell them theirs. Maybe they'd be interested. If you were in front of the pyramids with Simon, you wouldn't even see them. And they say girls are curious. In love, what is monstrous is that desire has no limits and action is the slave to limits. It's that willpower is infinite and execution restrained. We locked Cardinal La Ballue in a cage. We taped up posters at night in the streets of Amsterdam with Spinoza. We sang the Marseillaise on the highways in '92, slept with the rats at Gavroche in the belly of the elephant of the Bastille, put up barricades in '71, took the Battleship Potemkin, fraternized in the trenches, defended Madird, and went on vacation in '36 and marched on the cliffs in '62. But these poor guys there are penniless. They can no longer tell the good from the bad. It seems the good weren't actually so good. I don't want to hear it. And since then, I've been conservative. We'd still be on Noah's Ark. Well, you without me since I can't stand animals, except sea urchins and laughing zebras. That's why I like the Mediterranean without tides, tropics where the sun always sets at the same time, school where you go everyday from 10 to 6. That's why I like being at home with the blinds always shut. Nobody gets up or goes to bed inside. - Still, old girl, we've known a long time you never swim in the same river twice. I'm going to look for some stagnant backwater. You're a coward! When you were little, you couldn't even go door to door to sell anti-tuberculosis coupons. And I was the one who got yelled at for asking our parents to buy them. Martyr child! I was timid and hated business. You were the cowardly one! You knew we weren't allowed to hang out in the street. And you still sold a few to the teacher who made me suffer so much. Just to be like everyone else. The same way you wanted to go to church and wear an organdy dress on Sundays. That's all hot air. Plus, back then, we were still one. That would surprise me! You've always been against me and me against you because you're a little snob! You see what you're supposed to think and be against, and you think and oppose, but what do you really do? Once again: you act like everyone else. Yes, I act like everyone else. I live. You breath, that's all. I'm suffocating. I'm not cowardly, I'm a scaredy-cat. Even a dog scares me who has braved tigers and buffalo and naked guerrillas armed with kalashnikovs. That's why I do things. What do you do? What good do you do? What good do you do? Nothing. I'm fine being upset at this thing where we're living, where everything sucks but seems good. Against the good who are bad and the bad who are bad. No, I'm not content. I'm not happy. Oh, good? No, bad! Boom! Pierrot, his friend. Oh Lord, let me see. Oh Lord, keep me blind. You never swim in the same river twice. Open cupboards remind me of death. I don't know what to put on. I have nothing to wear. Nothing! That's enough. Come on, let's leave it. You notice them because they're confused on the last step of the subway and they get lost in the life of the street, like Parisians. Right, I'm not even a foreigner anymore. I know all the people here. I know where they're going and what they're doing. "I'm a poor orphan," says Pierrot. I didn't say that. It's a quote. Want to go back? What a terrible question. I'll come back to it. At 30 and 40 in the undergrowth. Pierrot! Hi, how are you? I'm fine, thanks. And say we have to go sleep. It's time stolen laughing. I love sleep. Is it your favorite activity? So what's your favorite? Everything. I don't know... And what's your favorite? Good evening, how are you? - Good evening. I'm fine. I'm Nana, no international family. He you! Look at me. Okay I am. - Recognize me? Sure, you were sitting on jetty earlier. All black people look alike, eh? Well, see you soon. Wait for me. What are you doing? Walking home. - See you tomorrow. See you soon, Pierrot, my friend. We're lucky. What do you want to do? Not go to the restaurant. Not that... In life. I don't know. Nothing. This. I only want what I have. This will take forever. I place my hand inside and it is like sinking into silence and I return to the void. Glasses! I need to go somewhere. Why not walk to the beat of this line? I need to go somewhere. That will guide me. Take me out of this vile city. I'd like to escape to a foreign city. Escape is a joke. Why? Because it is. Because if you don't like your life, it's nobody's fault. Not this city, which isn't vile. You're responsible for it. If you raise your hand, you're responsible. Close your eyes, you're responsible. Light a cigarette, you're responsible. So, life is life? Agathe! How are you? Very good. Did you find it? Are you making fun of me? I'm smoking a pack a minute and you ask if I found it. I have no husband, no money, no work, no home. I want to leave. On vacation or forever? - On vacation. Want to go together? No, I can't. Besides, I'm meeting someone. With who? - Pierrot. I'll come with you. - No. Why not? Anyway, he's leaving tomorrow. Cool. he'll take me away. And Simon? I love him. And him? Does he love you? Yes. Yes. And I don't even care. Loving him is enough. The blond. Can you give me a lift? She said you're leaving tomorrow. Interested? I can't come. I have to work. We didn't ask her. I'm going home. I'm tired. You coming up? Right, I forgot. Have a nice evening. You have a partner, right? I dumped him. You couldn't even give him a belly dance. I find myself alone, alone, alone. - You haven't understood a thing. Are we going up? - You don't know a thing about love. Imbecile. Leave me alone. Jerk. You don't even know what an imbecile is. I'm not hungry. I'd rather have a drink. No, never before evening. You look sad. Something wrong? Listen, I see you're unhappy but be reasonable. Listen, do as I do, as if the world was made for you and to your size. You don't want to take a trip? I don't want to travel. Have you forgotten the pleasure of arriving in a foreign city in the morning? You don't know a soul and go have a coffee in any old cafe, and always find the right one. You stay and watch people you don't know anything about start to mill about and live mysterious lives, who don't know you but don't reject you. Everything is possible and imaginable and then you drag your bags to a hotel and find the right one, and all that remains is to do something with this freedom. That's where I lived when I was little. It smells like baking bread. This car is too small. Why didn't you rent a convertible? We'd at least get some color. Can I put this upfront? Why didn't we fly? I wish we were there already. He starts to tell her how this reminds him of childhood, how Sundays in the forest, behind the city where he lived, he couldn't or didn't want to stop walking. In the forest behind the city where I lived, I couldn't or didn't want to stop walking. I looked at the pine needles on the ground or the withered leaves of the green oaks and I said to myself I could never exhaust this forest and this need to walk. I got lost on purpose, losing my parents, despite fear, to be sure I could keep sinking into this feeling. And at first this fear increased the possibility of pleasure and gave it something extra. But then, it started to chip away at it. And very fast, it was all there was. And when I got in the car to go back to the city, I was unhappy and torn apart, as if I was missing the bliss contained in the patches of light on the sand and I'd never know it, that I'd never brushed against it. And I felt – inhaling but not finding the smell again eucalyptus leaves in my hand – miserable. Like at the arrival of spring... If you aren't up to the happiness that comes, available, present. I don't understand. I've never liked nature. I'm not an outdoors person. I need cities. But this has nothing to do with nature. It's a story about tenacity. I love life. Ouch! You're suffocating me. You thinking of nothing? Of me? What are you thinking about? - You. Really? I thought you were thinking of you. When I think of me, I think of you. I never think of you. Even when you're not here. You're behind me or inside me, bothering me. And I talk to you. I can't do anything else. Small bits of you live in me because I can't even recall your face I see the corner of your mouth, crease. Where the arm attaches to the body. An eyelid that opens, your hand wiping your nose. That's why I look at you but it's pointless. That's why I don't think of you, because these bits are already enough to make me suffer. I'm going to have you stuffed. You always cook in your mouth... starting with worries and concerns. We're spoiled. What we need is a good war. There's a time for war and a time for peace. I never saw, knew, read. You didn't read Ecclesiastes. That there was never a time for peace except now for us and for the past 50 years, because there's no lack of wars. But those aren't good wars. I need a true, pure, good war obviously. We know we're right. We're not afraid, well, not too afraid, to die. An anti-colonial war, for example. I don't know, you don't find them anymore. You just find confusing things since the end of the Cold War. That was a clear war that created many other small, murderous ones, that kept us busy. If he doesn't come, I'm lucky. Is my sandwich coming? Can you give me 5 francs? For the jukebox. How late are you waiting for your friend? - 3 a.m. I'll come back at 3 a.m. If he hasn't come, I can help you out. It's me, Pierrot. Welcome. How are you? Good, thanks. You? Good, thanks. Am I bothering you?\- No. I could recite this book. Raskolnikov is a guy I'm fond of. I kind of wanted to do the same thing to my old man. He's a crook. Let's economize our arms. I love the edge of the water, especially the sea. I come here for calm. I do as I did in Conakry. I was unemployed, so I'd flee the old man's reproaches. A conman... That old man liked my canned food too much. I take a book. There's a white girl who gave me three. And I go to the beach. It's calm. There's nobody, just students studying. There's no sea where I come from. There's a river that runs in two directions. Like every other river in the world. You know, I got to Conakry and saw everything was broken. I was happy, I was sure of work but there was just scheming. So I was unemployed. Here is well constructed and I work. I work like a madman. I think of almost nothing. But I'm confidant. Nana, you're stubborn. There's a proverb in Burkina Faso: "A blessed child never lacks bread." I'm a blessed child too. Is your butt sore or do you want to go? Both. I have a meeting. I'll come with you. Cobblestone is hard but I respect it a lot. That's what our country needs but our leaders like marble. Where's your bike? Maybe I'll do the same thing as Raskolnikov, but I doubt it, because he turned himself in and I don't want to do the crime even if I'm suffering. And I can't turn myself in. "An imbecile is a kind of degenerate characterized by physical anomalies and intellectual and moral troubles. His intelligence is limited... But above all the sense... - Apollo Pierrot. ...revolt, lack of discipline, liar, na na na na na. An imbecile is always looking to play a bad joke. His fellowship with those of the same fate is always suspect The number of imbeciles in mental hospitals is tiny, compared to those who are free and live as tramps." "Oceans, far from despair" You smell good. Yes, because I have perfumed thoughts. What have you done since the other day? I knew we had the same taste. That'd surprise me. I only like myself. That's what I just said. You talk too much. You're right. That of the strongest. Shut up. No feeling, I don't like that. Wretched guy! Because the worst is that all of this is us. Our enthusiastic stupidity combined with our defects that created it. We say down with censorship and win, but nobody says anything. We say the poor have no food and we have fast salad bars on every corner. I know. We never call a butcher shop a "meat bar." And what to do with grocery stores, dairies, jewelry stores, crepe joints, stupidities? That's no reason to regret what we've done. Regarding butcher shops, you just need to sign up. You'll find an armed gang that answers to your convictions. My what? You have no idea, you little collaborator. What I lack are my troops. Is ten minutes long? Know what I'd like? Ice cream? I'd like to put my legs here, my head here, my arms over here, and I'd go do what I want. Isolated, the limbs wandered from here to there. What do you want? We're spoiled. We have everything but it's all nothing. They tell us we have it all but we have nothing. Not the breath of an idea, no morals, no future. Since we've arrived at the peak of the present, this jam of selfishness wrapped in nice feelings and corrupt democracy, this dull magma that takes itself as its own model. And since we've denied the past, we have no history. And we only need to give our support to this tyranny that proclaims its rights against others, demons, savages... The right to conformity, submission, weakness. Long live audacity, desire, generosity! Long live my heroes, my fathers! Their beauty shines along with their ideas and mistakes. Long live mistakes, emotion, honor, courage, virtue! Why did they make me? I said that when I was 5 years old. It was night, I went into the kitchen, which was blue. I was crying and said: "Why did you make me?" It's true. Why did they make me if it's to eat pistachios? I forgot all these people exist. It's tiring to think I forgot this. Today just keeps on falling. I'd like to go back six months to when I was young. Before, if we saw each other for 5 minutes, I was beatified for 3 days. I was calm and laughed all the time. Now, if I'm away from him for a minute, I can't breathe. I haven't breathed in months. And even when I'm with him, it's not okay if I don't touch him and even that isn't enough. I need to go through him. And even then, I need to begin again immediately. So you see, it's a hopeless case. I'd like to be free of this. Your joke is sad. - It's because you're sentimental You're dreaming! I'm seductive. Like a monkey. - Idiot. Prove it. - These things can't be proved. They're verified. You just need to glue this and put air in it. Spare tire... - Freedom for us! Or love. - Are you a ma'am? Or a miss? - Will you come to my place? Or we go to yours? - I'll come to your place. In Brazzaville, there's an area called Talengai. Look at me. Every African city has a neighborhood with that name. It's always the most miserable, muddiest, most electrifying, and, generally lacking, I want to call myself that. The merchants have finished clearing their stalls. An army of cleaners comes to the main street, followed by a few burly stevedore. - Look at me! You won't see me again soon. We follow a stevedore who takes apart deserted stalls. He lifts the frames on his back, to a truck where he balances this pile of metal. Another follows him doing the same work. The sweepers sweep, the crate selectors select. The poor look around the abandoned crates. What are you doing? Looking for my pittance. I told you you'd end up in the gutter, stubborn and taking yourself for imperfect perfectibility, not listening to the world change. I'll act like I didn't see you. It bothers me to film the poor. It humiliates them. The proof: they never want to be filmed. No, to the contrary, film me! See, everything is turning around. I'm becoming the character. Now I see you with your city dinners, your matrimonial fights, your phone calls, your vacation photos and all that. I'm the hero and you're the one who looks pitiful. Fiction is on my side and the pathetic is on yours. Come, follow me. Trams brushed by light that pass each other and brake. Behind the hotel, it's the sound of the ocean that reminds me of it. Remember the magic child? She was eating alone at the cafe with her hands. She had hands and feet, a boy's confidence, and an all-powerful smile. And then, a really small kid took a ride in one of those salad baskets you find in piles... Faces pressed against window bars and hands gripping them. He was crying and the other vanished with his grace and vagabond strength. Shit, I need to restart. I'm leaving, come with me. My little body. My little body. It doesn't work in step with my desires. It doesn't work in step with my desires. Jérome, why not set up outside to work? I don't need nature. Who's going to the market today? You or me? We'll send Pierrot. These Andalousians, never a reasonable word. How these foreigners can talk! They always have something to say. We'll go together. Hurry up! Hurry up! I'm hungry. I fold them in two, then in four. And I call them travel drawings. That way, I can walk with them anywhere. Except that I don't walk anymore and I don't paint either. Because of my daughter, I can't. I have to see her every 3 minutes. I tell myself I'll learn her by heart. Then I'll be calm. But she keeps changing. You watch your Spanish beans sprout. It's funny, what I want above all, I had even before wanting it. Maybe since I wanted everything. Now, I hesitate, procrastinate. I can't decide what I need to want. You said you wanted a family. But for that, you need a wife first. - I know. We're not yet snails. You don't want to go back to your place by any chance? It's what I did. I came back here. So stay here. I like that better. This girl is stunning. Girls are all pretty but I don't like them. Well, there isn't one that I love... Say, do you know Paulina Orel? No, or rather, yes. Why? Did she die? She's a friend, Ani's friend. Or, rather, she was. They had a fight about something stupid. Something girly. I mean, about boys. They militated together. We were practically not born back then. So I waited the whole night on that dock. L'Espoir was closed. It was really dark! Because she'd also left with all the money. That dock had a very nice name. The front of the East Sea. - Oh, east or west, now... You know, back then... - There was always a party. Yes. No, things are different now... - Things are different. At that time... I don't know if you Toulon is. There were only sailors. Well, there was at least this one. We were never afraid. I never spoke. She ditched me there. She wanted to. I want to... I don't want to... Later, it became fashionable. Arsène... Did you know Arsène? He didn't come to a meeting, so we asked him why. He said he wanted to something else. So we asked why he hadn't warned us and he replied: I didn't want to... So he wasn't a god? Nothing. - It drove me crazy. Of course not. Besides, he's dead. Finally, in the morning she came to see if I was still at the cafe where she'd seduced this enchanted guy who didn't even know French. He'd given her his beret as a souvenir. So I stole it. She realized in the train she didn't have it, this beret that weighed a ton in my bag. I said she must have forgotten it at the cafe and all the better for her Baltic mariner. That's how I called him. You know, back then we only saw Russian films. Because giving your gun is forbidden and a gun and hat are almost the same for soldiers. A propos, what was his name? A propos what? I don't know anymore. I don't even know if she knew. And that's all in the past. We don't see each other now. In fact, why didn't you bring Agathe? She's in love. - I know. Why'd you ask me about all that? Oh no! Jérome! Pierrot is infatuated with snooty Paulina because she's become snooty now that's she's famous. Pierrot, she won't even look at you. There are much better ones out there, even Agathe. Why didn't' they get together? They're so beautiful, right Jérome? Life is poorly designed. Agathe has a fiancé. What's he like? And Pierrot is running after a stuck up woman. That's not normal, right Jérome? Orly, what are you still doing here? You'll be late. Your smile kills. It's me. Sorry, wrong number. I'm not... Hi, it's Pierrot. Please leave a message. It's my demon, it's not serious. If we could go back before the words that shouldn't be said were said. It's Pierrot. Please leave a message. Bye. Dear Glasses, I've left on an inspection tour of the world. To see there if I am here. I'm combing the countryside, plowing sea plains, ravaging beaches, I smelled the odor of guerrillas and caught butterflies. I'm pleased to rediscover the many pleasures of solitary travel. It's alone with myself, who you abandoned at a serious moment, and with the isolation that comforts me. You heard nothing. Each morning, after buying El Ahram from the turtledove merchant, you know the cages are piled up into cooing columns, I go have my mazbout coffee at the Dreamers Cafe and my heart beats on the washboard when the smile from Bassem's soul clears the dusty light and I only want to do what happens to me, meaning nothing. Purchases: white shoes to remind me of us, a tea strainer and stationary to remind me of you. I worry about kids from families of performers. Your metropolitan hands can keep them on the right path. Anyway, Pierrot didn't wait for time and all it brings had taught him that ultimate wisdom is having dreams big enough not to be lost from sight while you pursue them. He said I can't be trusted, that impunity doesn't exist. And I said, sure, of course impunity does exist. Look at me, I said, it's the salt of life. I'm unaware of misfortune. Oh, Pierrot, it's already in the past. I can't remember how it was. I can't remember anything. He told me things I don't understand. Do you understand? It's not true. I understand everything. It's not that I understand, but I know it. Before it happens, I know it will happen. It's not magic. You just have to know the world a bit. But if we could go back and it was just before it happened and it went differently... He said I always act like we have several lives and we could throw away several before finding the right one. I said, of course we have several lives. You don't think so? I said: with evil, it's bad. Without evil, it's worse. He got me lost. We leave the takes there on the right side. Godeffroy de Bouillon. Hégésippe Moreau. Sébastien Mioche He says I deceived him, but he deceived me With evil, it's bad. Without evil, it's worse! Hey Agathe! Agathe, are you there? Yes. I salute Alexandrie who goes away... In any case, now I have only one life, which I have no reason to spoil since it isn't my own. I want to redo my life but not the life of someone else. It's necessary to finish the ones that were hardly begun. Tchier-no-morny-flot! Wouldn't you rather we kidnap Paulina? Let's go. Get lost. Away! Let's go have a drink. Are you asleep? Pierrot, are you asleep? Listen. My heart stopped beating. I'm dead. Are you asleep? Simon, I'm bored without you. I turned the museum inside out and didn't find the small dark wood, shiny statue. The one with the pretty dick. The head, butt and hands that made us call him pharao. Mounir's. That statue, my love... vanished, another flown away, stolen... Hanging around the Pompeian streets of the cool cemetery, I saw that aside from the habit of the human race of inventing a few rich people to squeeze a heap of poor people we can find one common denominator, which would prove I'm not part of it: Love of pastries. Whether they eat them in sanctuaries built by nostalgic emigrants or in a fishy stall full of flies. Custards, delicate mochas, El Mulino, Dulce de lecce, Cape of Good Hope, date paste, Belomorkanal, makrouts and zalabias, les Délices, Carmen de Patagones, Tusker beer, Magadandsk, the Beagle Channel and no Stella to drown my distress. I went melancholically to the balcony looking at a corner of the city I love. Some motion in the street and stores. Give me back Posillipo and the Place d'Italie. Tomorrow I'll return to Europe with its old railings. Can you cover for me? Little one, did you see Pierrot? Miss? - Pierrot doesn't come anymore. Hey Agathe! Stop! Stop! Close it! Are you okay? - No... I'm unhappy. I'm unhappy! You're in love? I'm mad with joy. Yes, but I'm unhappy! I have a heartache! Oh, my dear, I want to say that these 2 little quatrains I read in the subway... Yes, verses he put in the subway: "I'm no longer what I was, And could never be it, My beautiful spring my summer have jumped out the window. Love, you were my master, I served you before all the gods Ah if I could be born twice, how I would serve you." I'll pour you a whiskey. I save the whiskey for people who don't like that.

Your brother isn't here. It's okay, I want to see you. I don't open for anyone. I'm the prisoner of Poitiers. Open up... My destiny is getting away. In that case... You think I have my destiny in my hands? Look at this. It's dirty. Cigarette butts everywhere, breadcrumbs too. For the past 5 days, I've decided to clean every morning. But I've done nothing. I won't budge until I've cleaned. Sadness is making me so stupid... Sadness gives me courage. - ...that I can't recognize myself. I occupy a place in the world that will be much better filled when I leave it empty. That's it. Good idea! Go buy me Javel water. Okay, I'll come with you. Your bike? No, this isn't appealing. I'm going back to bed. See you darling. Idiot, 92! Little jerk! Murderer, idiot, 92! You're wrong, I'm not young! Today is my birthday. I'm 30. Pierrot! She killed him. Shit, shit, shit. Pierrot! Pierrot! Where did you go? I looked for you everywhere. I'll be back later. I love life.
