I had to slaughter a chicken because it was lame. I limp. But since I would not be a good soup. Sometimes talking such nonsense ... What's this? Teacher. He is a new teacher. Probably not a teacher, but a pilot. It does not even furniture. Everywhere just planes. There is not a woman. How do you know? Marcia, school technician told me. His wife ran off with some actor from Kosice. See jozefko, now that I have a chance. Is not it? What happens to you, oatmeal? Do you work here for a year and still have not learned to come on time. I fell asleep. Asleep? I will wean from sleeping. This is your third time, and still not the end of the month. Hello. Hello. Did you get a warning, right? Paul, you're crazy. Every day you hang out here, and you let that old hag ore on you. I have a free bed. Stef went. Fool, is pregnant.

I'll get you wood, would you? What do I need? A lot of my backyard wood. You're a good boy, Bertie. What's in it? Say what. Hello! I tell you, Paul, you look terrible. You need to do something about that hair. And the figure. Let's get out of here. Here we are constantly trampled. You bitch. You pity me a beer. What do I do? You bitch. I'll kill you! It beats me! It beats me! It is Jirka. I know him. Bully! You're beating up my man? A dipshit. Go to hell! Janči. Hello uncle. Have you seen? As in the Old West. More specifically, the east. It's nothing. My dad once chased my mother with an ax just because she sat in the cab of a tractor and not in the back of the trailer as the other women. I can not even imagine what would happen if he arrived. Have you seen? Really? My name is Jirka I'm Pauline. What do we do? Well, Johanka, when we set the tub? Do not forget to invite me. I prefer to call in a plumber who does not drink. That does not exist. Come on, come on. Use the. I know you. Do not Tuljčika from? No, I'm from Gibova. We are back from the wedding. We arrived at the train. And the wedding was worse than a funeral. Sandwich with sausage. They said they needed more money for more important things. That crazy. What could be more important than the wedding? If it was not brother would break his nose. Listen, do not you Johanina daughter? You see, I know you from somewhere unknown. You look like your father. He was so strong. Okome talking about? About Johanna from Gibova, you know it. The one you are shacked up with her boyfriend who was digging a well? She paid for it, but enough. Girl you did not do anything wrong. Thank God you did not like your mother. Good morning. Right. You're not normal. Because of you, last night I had to sleep alone. I could not choose one, as the two have not yet tried. You ran the house as a child. That your bed ... is it still available? Have you talked to your mother? Dad, look! Good dan.Dobar day. My name is Johan oatmeal. I'm Peter Jarek. Sorry, this ... I have to go. Goodbye. Goodbye. Paul, do you think I'm an idiot. Once you get married, I'll take my mother with me. My father drowned. He fell into the liquid manure, and drowned. The mother is now living with his brother. He married a waitress. She's older than him at least 50 years of age. Food waste my mother. I saw with my own eyes. I thought I was going to kill her. You know Paul, besides mother and me, I do not have one. Oat friend, but I want you to call. But yesterday I talked to PAVLINKA, and we all settled down. This morning I could not believe my eyes, was the first Pavlinka. Not here, she went to look for accommodation. I think it's a good idea. The lack of interest in PAVLINKA I connected with the fact that she does not have a father. Pavlinka, I do not care where you were last night But ... Please work so that she would not have to be ashamed of after life. I have nothing to be embarrassed about. You should be ashamed. Johanka. What happened? If you do not open the gate, jozefko, I will destroy. I do not have time. Just try, robber. Izbušiću you all the tires. A ode'll have time. Show credentials. Here, here jozefko, just do not let you pull a gun. Next you'll have to shoot in the fingers. Pilot summer again today. The old man and the game as a child. I brought you some soup. Thank you Johanka, you should not ... Did he come vet? No, but all the children from the village were there. Yesterday I was told to call the vet, but nobody listens. I had to Presov in dairy. I told him to call the vet but Mr. President was in a hurry to hunt. It will not last long. What is going on here? This is not a city bath. Bathe them at home. At home to heat water. And this is just odvrneš tap. There will be president and be evil. They will not come. He went hunting. Are you chul? What? The president today was fun. What happened? Margarita has fallen on the roof. What was she doing? She wanted to cut his own head circular. What did she do? No, there was no electricity. Margitka. What is it? Janko returned from the hunt? I know what kind of hunting. Instead he took the gun bra. Margitka, stop! He has other people. This is a shotgun. The President is here? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. He is waiting for the president? Awaits you. You are on the committee for culture. He will lead our chronicle. I let him go for a look. Call the vet in Presov. Do you have a comb? Have you heard? What? About his wife and one actor. What kind of actor? Our pilot game ua amateur theater. And the actor has come to teach them how to do it. He's all show. Call Prešov. You will not believe Peter but you really remind me of someone. My name is Paul. What did I say? Petra. God, what a fool I am. I'm sorry, Paul. Come on. Excuse me, my friend. What, you do not have a job? Did I tell you to call the vet? But you're not listening. You hurry to hunt. If you're already so smart, worry about cows and not on where I'm going. If you graduated from high school, you you're the smartest in the world? I'm smarter than you. Listen my dear Johanka what I'll say now. Your problem is that, you do not have a man, and that night a little ... Why did not you come when I called? I did not realize it would be so. You do not know how wonderful it is to think not only about themselves, be one soul, one body forever .. be one soul, one body, all ... Mr. Teacher, I can not. Johanka, you may not think about it. If you're afraid you'll forget my lines, it will happen. This happens even professional actors. Well, if you have already started ... When I am, I remember the "Major Renner" from beginning to end, every word. But when you look at me, women or children, I forget everything. Turn their ships, and again all I know. We'll get it all. We need more testing. Just try and try. Amateur theater is a noble goal. It teaches perseverance and courage. Johanka, continue with "I do not understand ..." Noah does not understand who survived a survivor that will not be forgotten. Get your stuff, we'll go home. They say everything is full of spies. Someone had already arrested. Good night. Good night. Johanka, if you allow me, I'll show you. No need, thank you. I live near. Good night. Johanka! You have ruined my life. 17-year wait for you. Why will not you? Bertie! I like you, but I can not marry you. Paul; Well, that's Jirka. He said he was horrible to look like someone else. I'll tell you something. Yesterday we were at a dance. There was this one guy. Working with us as a car mechanic. And you know what he said? He wants to marry me. I love that long. You may be married, then I'll take my mother with me. Damn! Life is not a joke, as I previously thought. Berti, not this where it is not too small? What is it again a little while? You is always a little bit. You can not extend your legs. And why do they stretch? It's not a coffin. I know a guy from Sabinov. Do this stuff. He says that such a product is difficult. All of this is a narrow profile. I went with him to the inn, paid a few round of drinks, and all was well. Do not marry randomly Johanka, when you buy all this? Maybe one day marry. How about Johanka? Beautiful flowers, right? Very. Thank you, Bertie. ? - What is it - came with a bathroom. And what is this? It's a bidet. What? Well, bidet. You are very smart. And what is it for? Sit on this Margitka, and the water flows all the way to heaven. Attention! Today at 18 pm will be performed plays. There will be held at the Cultural Center, but in a football stadium. Cultural center is used for grain storage. Tonight we will hold a dance, but there will be drinking. N show they invited people from Presevo, and soldiers who helped around the harvest. End of statement! ... do not think about yourself, connect one body and one soul ... one soul, one body, all ... Even if you become a victim of ... God, Mom! You look like a hippie. For this role I look young But Mom, you're still young. Jesus Christ! I'm so glad you're playing in this play. Uncle, no major Renner. What major? Pisto blacksmith does. His son was here and he said, to Pista play everything he learned, but not in front of people. Please, bring it. Do not worry, I'll get it. But hurry, please. See Johanka, That's what I'm supposed to take care .. Hi, Paul. Hello. See, what an actress! You have a visitor, ma'am. Unexpected guests. Vilko. Anica mine. I have not seen a long time ago. You know why. But now I'm here. Take you with me. Tomorrow I'm taking you out. Our girls are drawn to strangers. That's not good. Not good. Berti, are not you looking at? Who? Johanko. I'd like to see you at the altar, dressed in white. Do not wait for me, Anice Now Vilko wedding? Sad. Who knows what she could after that happens. When he's alone on stage, I'll look. The whole village was there. I can not say a word. Runway and you know this better than the Lord's Prayer. I know the back of the text. What I'm horse? Why did I take it? What do I need that? ' It's all about mixing women. He says, better to play in the play, but to sit at the bar. Now I know what is better. I am so happy to see Paul. I know that we drive to your town. I told you where I live. You have a beautiful forest. I love you Paul. I think of you. If you want, I will give you my picture. You already gave me. I'm sorry. Come PAVLINKA. I'm afraid. Do not be afraid. I will not hurt you. See how nice not to think only of themselves, but merge into one soul, one body, for all time. Even if we suffer or someone else ... When thoughts and desires coincide with feelings ... They will not understand the one who did not survive, which survived, he would not forget. Do not cry Paul. It had to happen once. You are so beautiful to ... Go! Pista, say something! Sorry to bother you ... Turn around. Sorry for the inconvenience. I am Major Renner. I came to see Anna Benko. This is me. Nice to meet you. Let me sit down. Go ahead. All the time to play with his back? When night falls, they will not see anyone and will face the audience. I do not want to feel as if you were at the hearing. You're a lady. Johanka, is that you? No, I'm Pauline. What are you doing here so late? I hope you know your neighbor. He was on the show, and drank like a pig. He said I was laughing like a mare, and I was groping other men. PIPA, and why not? They have nothing. We'll sit here a little longer until the child falls asleep. Pavlinka, are you still there? - Yes, I'm here. He wanted a woman 15 years younger, and now wants to have so many years as there is his mother. Ass dude. That's my fault. I lusted to a new house, I got an old husband. Who are you looking for? Jirku. Last name? His name is Jirka. High. He has black hair. So many of these. A good guy. The fight, a loss of form ... You will not see this so soon. What happened to you? Such men. Should therefore not to worry. All men are the same. I had a lot of them. I do not want to see any. Do you want coffee? I thought you would not even say it. I saw them together at Pres. You well know how it is with the soldiers. The soldier is like a bird. Pavlinka should find yourself a nice guy. Someone like Tomas Jakabuka. Who? So, what is to educate foresters. That Malone? What is a man? So what Pavlinka also not a model. Good afternoon. Welcome Tomas. My aunt told me that Pavlinka wanted to meet me. Of course he does. Just do not say it yet not to be ashamed of. You better tell her you want to meet her. You understand, do not you? Dad told me he will buy me the same kind of gun if I'm a good student. And this is not yours? Dad's. I would like shotgun. But if not, it is a good and kind. You know Paul, and I would not go for foresters not guns. A man and a gun go together somehow. Select, right or left wing. Anyway. Then right. Too bad dad locked ammunition. They would see how it would be a hit. - God, what happened? Sam went off. Pavlinka! She was charged. Dad forgot to pull out. I feel bad ... She was frightened. Do you have something in that head? He could have killed her. Dad's fault ... You were right Johanka. Small and stupid. When I'm walking past the shops, even ten hell can not hold me. Look what I bought. Janko will grumble, but it's President. Who will wear a modern shirt if he does not. The story comes to a new president, educated. Janko is no such fears. 10 of them will be put into your pocket. He has a connection. Want one? Stop, please! Your Pavlinka loves our sausage from the factory. And why would not they love me? If you work there, why would not eating. The others are doing. Is she stupid or blind. Or just pretending not to know. But the whole village knows that it is not thick sausage. Hello gitk. Hello. My husband is here? I have not seen. You have a lot of work? Very much. I hear you're putting on a wedding. What kind of wedding gitk? I'm old, and Pavlinka is too young. She does not have much time. On the bus she was still evil. How evil? How evil? Pavlinka! I know everything. Get down there. Get down or I'll kill you. Posećiću nut and you'll kill him. What did you do Pavlinka? What did you do? Now you cry. You should not cry when you're chasing the soldiers like bitches. Kill me if you want to. Too bad we do not have a gun on me. To scare him if he starts to pull. This is not a game. Give me a picture. You know what Bertie. I'd better go myself. Carpet should be plush, dark golden color. Good afternoon. I Jirkin friend, Franta. I understand you want to talk to him. Good afternoon. I Pavlinkina mom. Know. I saw you at the show. You see, Jirka is in trouble. He had to go home. I do not understand. He had problems with his girlfriend. You must be a woman. Imagine, she was already five months pregnant. He's an idiot, that's what I told him. But I know that he loves PAVLINKA. He told me. She wrote to him. If he marries her, her home would kill her. What a nerd! I'll break his face, asshole. Wherever you go, make children. This will help us Bertie. Give me two bottles, no, four bottle of red wine. I will drown you! I will drown you! Are you crazy, Johan? She's not the first nor the last. Come on, pi, you bastard! Oh, my God! Oh my God! Pour me another, jozefko! Nalivaš vain. Her or holy water will not help. There are only two possibilities. To have an abortion ... No! jozefko not, It does. Then ad. Neither is a solution. What are you gonna do? Nothing? Leave as is? Oh, my God! Why is not drowned when she was only one day? What do I do that? What do I do that? What did she do? If you already want to know, what you did. I'm glad that you immediately agreed to meet me. We are here this morning and I Joschka. We work in Ostrava. We arrived by train last night. We had a few drinks. I hope you are not angry with us. Why would you get angry? If feels good and does not hurt, drink. You see, I am. And that's why I'm sad. I was supposed to get married, with a cleaning lady. But while I was helping who was building a house, that bitch cheated on me with another. Well, life is like that. Great wine! Joschka drinking vodka, rum, beer ... whatever. I call it a tour, one Joschka. On health. At the end look like a drawing. Neither color is not required. Of course, not every night. Most Fridays. Others go home to dinner, I Joschka and drink like a fish. Joschka read your ad in the newspaper. A Jirka, our friend, has written a response to a typewriter. Maybe you're mad at me, but I could not otherwise. I would like to find love, because I drink. And which one of you wants to get married? Peacock! Peacock! Good evening. Jesus Christ. I brought you a new idea. But you seem to have other worries. Oh, nothing ... I'll be there next time. No, do not go. Please be seated. Or better here in the room. - Excuse me ... - Nothing. I'm afraid I have something to offer you ... I actually have red wine. We cooked wine. I'll make to you if you want. No thanks, I do not need. Come on, come on, please. Sit down, sir master. Thank you. Sorry to talk about your problems. Not a problem. Happiness is when you have to be born a new man. It is unfortunate when someone leaves this world. Will play and runways blacksmith? Yes. We must not forget to send a telegram Michal. Although long did not come to the wedding should take place. You only have one brother. Jozefko know, I have not slept all night, I thought about everything. You know what I learned? We can stagger people in the head. Let them think what they want. Do we, two healthy women, we can not upbringing a child? You know Johan, do not say stupid, but unwise. Have you forgotten how you call everyone in the village? And just because you do not have a husband .. You do not have a husband, never right. I'm here to tell you ... What? I can not marry you. Why? I'm waiting for the baby. So what? There is a building We'll live. When a child is born, it can turn into three-room apartment. See you Saturday! Hello! Is that him? Joschka! Get out! Get out! Joschka, have you seen? How are quieted. They were afraid. Pavlinka! I thought long about all this. And I concluded that I was wrong. You do not have to get married. What's done is done. In the end, I survived that I live through you. This is Stefan? Pavlinka! Berti, are not you sorry well? There is plumbing. But the well is well. Do not bother. Get out. Pull. I'm so glad you came. Johanka, you know damn well that I will not die, before piped to your wedding. Johanka, offer us a drink, what the most expensive. I guess we deserve. Do not worry, Bertie, I'll get. It can not hurt.

Yesterday I got the last bus, so we were a little asleep. Come in. Excuse the mess. You know, so it is when a man lives alone. He wanted to become a pilot, went to flight school, but his doctors found something on my leg or back, even she does not know. Since then, only the game. I do not defend him. There is nothing wrong in that his hobby. Please be seated. I'm so glad we're back together. I took care of an aunt. Until the last moment. Many struggled. Such is life. Good afternoon.

I'll buy her champagne. Let's have another bottle. What do you think? Jozefko, maybe it's good that he did not come. What is it? Have you gone completely mad? A wedding? A Pavlinka? Pour me another glass. Jozefko, this is not a ticket to heaven, This is a ticket to hell. I am at the station long watching the Štefan. Doctor or lawyer than he will ever be. But a man is not bad.
