I can see it all now. We're on the course at Pinehurst. There's a thousand people following us. We're ready to tee off on the last hole. Now, I hand Joe the club. He walks up to the ball very nonchalantly. He takes aim, he swings and it's a screamer right down the fairway. Fore! [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Then I hand him his niblick. What's a niblick?That's a littler stick. Now, he hits the ball right up on the green. It's about 25 feet from the cup. Now, if he sinks this, he beats Hogan. He'll be the new champ. He aims, he putts and the ball is going right for the cup. It's at the cup and it rims the edge and goes around, and around and around and around... But it doesn't go in. [ALL MURMUR]It don't go in? But, wait. Hogan putts. He hits his ball, and it knocks Joe's ball right into the cup! CAMINELLO:It's in, it's in. We won. Sure we won.He's my son, no? [ALL LAUGHING] And they take him up to the Judge's Stand and they give him this trophy. He's the new champion. Then they present him with a $10,000 check.
