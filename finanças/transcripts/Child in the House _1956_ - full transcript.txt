Charles, is there a toy shop at Victoria station? - Yes, madam. Oh never mind, there isn't time. Drop me at the Brighton platform. I suggest you pick up Mr Acheson at his office. He said he'd be early today. Do you want me to wait for you and the little girl? No. We'll find our own way home thank you. Very good, madam. Have you seen a child? A girl, about seven? Lots lady. One kind and another. School's broken up, as you might say. Thank you. How was she dressed, exactly? - I don't know. Well, that's makes it look more, what you call "complicated" doesn't it. There was a little girl in red. I tell you I don't know what she is wearing. Oh, but she may have red hair. Now, there was a child, female stripes. Red hair. Over there. By that case of pigeons. - Oh, thank you. Platform ticket ,lady. Penny in that machine. Oh, I haven't got a penny. Here, take this. Thank you. Gorblimey. Come on. Come on. Hello. Are you Elizabeth? - Yes. I'm your aunt Edith. How do you do. You know it seems odd that we've never met before, doesn't it. I don't see how we can be expected to. Do you? No. Father says I look like my mother. Like Grace? Yes, yes you do a bit. I don't think you do. Father said you didn't. Sisters aren't always alike you know. I expect you're tired and hungry after your journey, aren't you? We must get back as quickly as we can. Your uncle Henry is longing to meet you. Have you any luggage? - Yes. This is my case. Is that all? Shall I carry it for you? It isn't heavy thank you, aunt Evelyn. Come along. You found the little lady, then? - Yes, yes thank you. Good luck. Did you think I was lost, aunt Evelyn? No, of course not. I was just a bit late. That's all. Anyway, I expect you can look after yourself. Can't you? Oh yes. We travel quite a lot. Father's work takes him abroad, you see. - Yes, I'm sure it does. Now what would you like to do, bus or taxi? You choose. Well, it doesn't matter does it if they both go the same way? Which would you like to do? I'd like you to choose. I don't mind really. Of course you do. It's the sort of thing children do mind about. I know you see. I don't mind. Really I don't. - Which way do you generally go? Whichever is handier. Of course, if it is father we usually take a taxi. Well, anyway our people go by bus all the same. You will get used to it won't you? Travelling to Professor Topolski's. Am I really going to a ballet school in London? Yes, your mother wrote and told me how much you enjoyed it. She doesn't want you to miss it while you're here. Don't stand in the middle of the road, dear. You'll get run over. When do I start? - Tomorrow. Don't jig about so. You're not at the ballet school yet. Jigging about isn't ballet, aunt Evelyn. Taxi! This is our house. Well, what do you think? It's very nice, aunt Evelyn. The park is just across the road. You can play there whenever you like. Can I help you madam? Could you take this bag and leave it in the hall cupboard. Elizabeth, this is Cassie. - How do you do. Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. - Here's the keys. They're here, sir. Hello. Oh, you got back early after all. I'm so glad. Elizabeth, this is your uncle Henry, dear. Elizabeth. About time we met, isn't it? - Yes, uncle Henry. Shall we go in? Dix-huit. Rouge. Vert. Hello? Hello? Communication, s'il-vous-plait. Look, I've been trying to get long-distance .. I am trying to communicate with Brighton. Oui. Angleterre. Two hours delay? But you told me that two hours ago. "I think your number has now come through." Good. Put them on. Yeah, yeah, okay. Will you hang on a minute? Un momente s'il-vous-plait. Mrs Groves. Mrs Groves. That call from Paris has come through. Un momente. You'd better hurry up or they'll cut you off again. Oh, shut up! Hello? Yes. Yes. This is Brighton 29670. Mrs Groves? Stephen Lorimer. I should have been in touch sooner but I've been so tied up in the last 2 days. Oh yes, yes. I rang the hospital this afternoon. They are moving Mrs Lorimer to a London hospital. What's that? To London? It seems there's some important specialist gentleman at .. The Princess Beatrice hospital I think it is. You mean, she's already gone? - "Yes, sir." The ambulance came and took her. She did seem much better and brighter I thought. What of Elizabeth? You're looking after her? "No, sir." Mrs Lorimer arranged for her to stay with the Achesons in London. "Her aunt Evelyn and uncle Henry. She told me to tell you on the phone." With Evelyn and Henry, eh? I see. I suppose that's alright. I'll call the London hospital tomorrow and talk to Mrs Lorimer about it. Your wife arranged everything. Elizabeth will even have ballet lessons in London with Professor Topolski. Thanks again, Mrs Groves. Yes. I've already finished speaking. Thanks. Alright? Oh madam, is this what you wanted? I found it at the back of your stocking drawer. Thank you, Cassie. Do you know who that is? You? - No. Your mother before you were born. You see, we were alike. You can have it if you like. Oh. Do you like television? Thank you. Henry, isn't there a "children's hour" or something around this time? Look it up would you? Oh. Alright. Hmm. [ TV: ] "Well, children, that's all for this evening." "And we hope to see you again at the same time tomorrow." "For the further adventures of Soapy and his animal friends." It was amusing, wasn't it. Yes, I wish we had a TV set at home. Did you like it, uncle Henry? What's that? Oh yes, very much. You weren't looking at the screen Henry. - I followed it by ear. Which part did you like best? Well, I think perhaps .. - Was it the beginning? Or where he fell off the donkey? - Yes, that was very amusing. How do you like being cross-examined, Henry? What's "cross-examined" aunt Evelyn? - Well dear, your uncle's a barrister. He has to ask people questions in court to find out the truth. Oh. Do they tell many lies? Well, often they try to. Madam. Yes, Cassie? I wonder if I could go now. You see .. It's not your night off is it? Well, no madam only you see my aunt has been took sick again. And I thought I'd run over and see her. Your aunt seems to have a lot of sickness these days. I know. Isn't it awful sir, the way some people get away with it. And others, they don't know what it is to have a day's health. Yes, it is. Alright Cassie. Try not to be late home. Yes, madam. I'll leave Miss Elizabeth's warm milk in her room before I go. Oh, and sir. Harry's come round with the car. Thanks, Cassie. Well, ladies. I think I must leave you too. Not on Elizabeth's first night. I doubt Miss Elizabeth minds if I go out or stay in. What do you say, Elizabeth? Of course she doesn't. I may as well tell you, I'm not used to children. I don't pretend to understand them. Your aunt is different. She does pretend. So I'll leave you two to manage for yourselves. Goodnight, Elizabeth. I'll bet you're in bed when I come back. Yes, I suppose so. Goodnight, uncle Henry. Henry? - I shan't be late my dear. Hutchinson must see me about the court's bill before he comes into the house. Hutchinson is a bore. After all, it was you who wanted me to cultivate him. Goodnight, my dear. Chocolate? Oh. Thank you. I hope you're going to be happy here with your uncle and me. Yes, I hope so aunt Evelyn. You're not going to feel too strange or lonely, are you? No. What time do you usually go to bed? - Eight o'clock. Well, we must try and keep things the way you're used to. What would you like to do meantime? I don't mind. What do you generally do? Nothing special. Father sometimes sings. Yes, I know. Do you like reading? Have you got lots of books? - Yes. There's lots of books in uncle Henry's study. But I don't think they will be of much interest to you. Do you draw? - Yes, but I'm not much good at it. Of course, you're too big for dolls. Yes. I know. We'll go upstairs and see if you've got everything. Is my case up there? No. I think Cassie left it in the hall. In the cupboard. We have to see if everything is unpacked for you, don't we. Alright. But I want to show you something first. Stay there. Turn around, and close your eyes. Go on. I won't be a moment. [ Music chimes ] Oh, how pretty. It's a musical box. - No it isn't. It's a handbag. Well, a handbag. Yes, of course. A musical one. He bought it in Vienna. Oh. Have you been to Vienna? - Yes. Mummy says it's a wonderful place to be happy in. Have you been to Vienna? - No. Father's been nearly everywhere. I suppose his work takes him about? Yes. He says he couldn't be stuck in one place for ever. A pity he had to go away now with mother so ill. Yes. It doesn't seem right, does it? Where has he gone this time? I don't know. He hates making plans. But he must have told you where he was going? No, aunt Evelyn. But Elizabeth, surely with mother so ill .. He must have left a way to contact him? - No. But Elizabeth, surely .. - He never does. Oh, here's Cassie. She'll take you up to your room. It isn't quite your bedtime, but I expect you're tired after your journey. But madam, I have to go out. My auntie, you know. Never mind. It won't take you a minute. Is Miss Elizabeth's warm milk up there? - Yes, madam. I don't like my milk heated, thank you aunt. Nonsense. It's good for you. Now, hurry up now. Come on then. I'll race you .. - I'll do my best, two at a time. Training. To the bar. To the bar. Hurry up, Lizzie. Here. Hold this. How do you think you're going to like it? Very much, thank you Cherry. Really, old Toppy gets me down. Which way do you go? I take a number 59 bus down there. Oh, too bad. I go the other way. Maybe someday, you can invite me to your house for lunch? Cheery bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye-bye. Guess who? Daddy. - Hello sweetheart. Have you been waiting for me long? - Hours and hours. How's tricks? - Alright. Can you come home with me on the bus to uncle Henry's? Sorry sweetheart, no can do. - Big business deal? That's the angle. Do you have to travel? Oh my bus. You get the next one. - Alright. Come on. Take a walk up and down with daddy. You like that? Yes. I see Mrs Groves got you on to the train and in to London on schedule. How do you like staying with your aunt? - Alright. Daddy. The ambulance came to take mother to hospital in London. I know. - When will you hear about her? I'm ringing up the hospital this evening, sweetheart. How's aunt Evelyn? Very well. Daddy, did they bring mummy to hospital in London because she's very ill? That's why I'm here. To find out. I'm glad aunt Evelyn got you off to ballet school on time. Else I might have missed you. Do you get on with her? You haven't met her for a long time, have you daddy? Quite a few years. Did she say anything about me? - Not much. She couldn't think of you not giving us your address. With mother being ill. So that I could get in touch with you. What did uncle Henry say? He always liked to have things trim and tidy. I don't know him very well yet. He says he doesn't understand children much. Uncle Henry knows a lot more than he pretends, sweetheart. That's part of his success. Do you think you'll be happy with them? - I expect so. Try to be. It's kind of them to take you in, you know. Yes father. Can't I stay with you while you're here in London? Come and sit here. Can't I? Darling, I'd love it, but .. I may be off tonight or tomorrow. As soon as I find out about mother. And in the meantime, your aunt and uncle might wonder where you're staying. And if anyone knew I was in London .. My business might suffer very much. We don't want that, do we? - No. So we'll keep this little meeting just to ourselves. Our secret .. okay? Okay. Now then. Another little hug for daddy? He's been missing them. You know that if I don't get one of these hugs every once in a while .. I just don't feel up to things. Know that my baby? - Me too. Hmm. Listen, I've an idea. Taxi. - What are you doing? We'll steal some time just to ourselves. What if we have tea together? - Yes! Right. Come on. Get in. Take the next left. I'll say when to turn. Right sir. Come on, sweetheart. Come on. - You did say you'll .. Leave the door, Mr Lorimer. Apr?s-vous, Madame. - Merci, papa. Now .. Would you like to put your clothes on the bed? Oh yes. Would Madame prefer tea or .. milk? Milk. Cold, of course. - Icy cold. Oh, daddy. Can we see the hospital where mummy is from here? I'm afraid not, sweetheart. It's some way off. All you can see from there is a dirty old back yard. But outside, we have a beautiful church spire. How did you enjoy the ballet class? All the fancy acrobatic stuff? Oh daddy, you are silly. I'm beginning to think so myself. Daddy, professor Topolski got annoyed with me first thing. What about? - He saw me make signs to Cassie. Who's Cassie? Aunt Evelyn's maid. She took me to dancing class today. I like her very much. But you're not too certain about her mistress, eh? Do you like aunt Evelyn, daddy? I admire her. She's not a bit like mother, is she? Not a scrap. Relations often aren't, which is sometimes a good thing. All the same. I want you to do what aunt Evelyn and uncle Henry tell you to. They know best. Or at least they think they do. Come on. Sit here. It should hold you. The furniture isn't very much in our palace for tonight. Daddy, do you remember that time at the hotel in Vienna? When mother sat on the old chair and the leg broke? She laughed like anything. Mother always does. It's the most enchanting thing about her. As soon as she's well again. And I have this big business deal straightened out. I'll come and fetch you right away. We'll all be together again. Oh yes, daddy. How long will it be? Can't be too soon for me sweetheart. Or for mother. Couldn't you take me with you? I've told you. I couldn't. Well, couldn't you have come and stayed at uncle Henry's too? I'd like to see aunt Evelyn's face if I turned up on the doorstep. Now sweetheart, I have to be on my own. To be able to come and go as I please, and when necessary. You understand that don't you? Yes, father. I just wish I didn't have to keep it a secret. You will keep it a secret though? Promise? Promise? - Promise. That's my girl. Now, have a marshmallow. I got them specially for you. Mmm, sensational. It's rather fun really, having a secret between us. Yes. Can I come here again? You'd better not. I shall probably be gone by tomorrow. All I wanted to see, was that you were alright. And you are. But, supposing I'm not alright? But you will be. What could happen with aunt Evelyn? And you'd better hurry up. She'll be wondering where you are. Can't I just telephone you? I mean, if something is wrong. I've told you. I probably won't be here. And your aunt may hear you calling me which would give the whole thing away. Come on, sweetheart. Be a brave girl. That's it. Now, drink your milk. I'd better take you to your bus. But daddy, supposing you are here? Couldn't I just telephone you? - Baby, I told you. When I'm alone. From a telephone box? Alright then. I'll give you the number. But only when you must. And you must be careful. - I will be. Be sure you don't lose the number. - Yes. Where's your bag? Have you still got this? - Yes, and I'm always going to. It's the nicest thing I have. Have you got any money in it? - Ten shillings that mummy gave me. And aunt Evelyn game me two and six for the bus, and I kept the change. You're very rich. - Like you if the big deal comes off. Here's something in the meantime. Come on. Let's go. And with gold top, that makes one-eleven-eight. That's what I said. - And .. And to save you any extra adding up that will be fourpence change. Did you enjoy yourself last night? - Hmm. And after? - What's that got to do with it? You seem a bit short. That's all. As long as you're not short with the change. That's all that matters. How about the Palais, Thursday night? - Maybe, but I can't be late again. Why? Mrs Acheson do a carry-on did she? - No, but she gave me a look. Did she? How's the little girl making out, by the way? Oh, she's a little duck. I've took to her, I have. Have you? To think of it, she'll be back by now. - Where's she gone? I told you. Her ballet class. I had a look-see at it myself. - Did you? What's it like? It's alright. The way them bits of kids stand on their toes. Why don't you do the same thing? - Whatever for? Give me a kiss. What a liberty. And in front of the whole street. Come on. There's a time and place for everything. Oh, here comes the little one now. Hello love. You got back safe then? I was beginning to think that you was lost. I'm alright, thank you, Cassie. - Got your keys? Yes. Your aunt is waiting for you, love. My dear, of course she's angling for a knighthood for George. For what, I ask you? I mean, what did he ever do? Ah, but if it had been Henry. Everyone knows parliament does not make a move without his advice. Come along up Elizabeth. We thought you'd got lost. I'm alright, thank you aunt. Oh, is this the kiddie you were meeting yesterday, Evelyn? Yes. Come and say how do you do to Mrs McNally. How do you do. My dear, what wonderful hair. Oh, if only Allison's were like that, instead of sort-of off and out. Perhaps it will change. How was the dancing class, dear? - It was very nice, thank you. Oh, it's such a healthy exercise, I always think. I wanted Allison to take it up but she never can keep her balance. My dear, lunch is already in the study. Why don't you stay? My dear, I shouldn't. But it would save going to the club. The food is quite ghastly. But I have to be at the hairdresser at three. Come along in Elizabeth. You'll have a "little something" as Cassie calls it, won't you Vera? Well, just a teeny dinner-nip please, darling. How you manage to keep your servants, I can't think. Mine only stay long enough to copy my hairdo and they're off. You always seem to pick such treasures. I'm not altogether certain about Cassie. Oh, in what way? - She's inclined to be uppity. I like Cassie. So you should dear. Take your things off. Would you like a nice orange squash, and some of these lovely cocktail crackers? They're those lovely cheesy things. No thank you aunt. I've had something to eat. Really? Why, I didn't know they provided food at professor Topolski's too. Well they don't. But there's a girl there called Cherry, and she had a box with things in it. We'll see that you take something next time. A Thermos flask. It's alright, auntie. Of course you must take something. I am sure your mother would want you to. How is your poor mother dear? I am so sorry to hear that she's not been .. I don't know. Aunt, could you please ring up the hospital and ask how she is? I've already done so. - What did they say? They didn't know very much. She'd only just arrived. So I said I'd ring later. - Couldn't you ring them up now? Well, I'll ring again this evening. I hope you like cold salmon. - I meant now. I don't think there's much point. I'll ring again tonight. Take your salad Vera. Please aunt Evelyn. Elizabeth, put that phone down. Maybe they'll let you speak to her? Maybe I can? I'm sure mummy's quite alright dear. Did you hear what I said? - I want to know how mummy is. I want to know. I want to know. - Elizabeth. I want to know. I want to know. I want to know. Elizabeth. Darling. Sorry. Don't upset yourself in the least, my dear. Children, heavens, are unfathomable. But I think I should lunch at the club after all. It's nearer my hairdresser. It will give you time to sort-of straighten things out here. Do call me later, darling. Is that you, Henry? - It is. Is that the new one? - Yes. Rather nice. Well, I suppose I'd better get dressed, ready for your people. They won't be here just yet. I want to talk to you. You come into the study. What's worrying you? How well you know me. I didn't think it showed. The child? Yes. I see. I always thought I understood people. I knew how to manage them. I'm not doing very well with an eleven-year-old girl. Isn't it rather early to say that? She only arrived yesterday. It seems much longer. She's got to find her way about you know. I know. So do I. And I don't know how to. What's been happening? When she came back from dancing classes at lunchtime. She asked me if I would ring Grace. I tried to explain that I'd already rung the hospital and that I would again. But she absolutely insisted that I obey her immediately. She refused my simplest, reasonable request. And ran out of the room in a hysterical frenzy. The worst of it was, Very McNally was here. It will be all over London that we have a problem child on our hands. After all, you have to expect a child to be a little touchy. To change home, the mother in hospital. I know. I know all that. I'm not necessarily blaming the child. I realize it might be me. But I've never felt like this before, Henry. But, when she insisted, I .. just couldn't cope. I couldn't cope. A child in the home is something so new in both our lives. Would you like me to speak to her? Would you? Yes. [ Telephone ] Oh. Cassie will answer it. I just wish it were everyone. Then they can't come. That would be rather nice. All the same, I think I had better dress. They said you'd come. Would you .. Would you speak to Elizabeth first? Of course. A gentleman on the telephone to speak to you, sir. Detective Sergeant Taylor he said he was. Thanks Cassie. I'll take it in here. - Yes, sir. Tell Miss Elizabeth I want to see her in here would you. Yes sir. Hello. Oh yes, Sergeant. Yes? Of course I remember. This is something new sir. It's about an inquiry we've had from Brighton. Brighton? "They're anxious to trace a Mr Lorimer." Mr Stephen Lorimer. I understand he has some connection of yours. Yes, he's my brother-in-law. My wife and his wife are sisters. What exactly is Mr Lorimer's business, Mr Acheson? "He originally qualified as a lawyer." He was in my office for a time. We lost sight of each other lately. I don't know about his present activity. I see. I understand his little girl is staying with you while her mother's ill. "Yes, that's right." Would it be convenient if I came round and had a few words with the young lady? Not so convenient this evening. We have friends coming and theatre afterwards. Well there's no hurry Mr Acheson. Tomorrow evening will do just as well. Well, shall we say seven-thirty? "Seven-thirty then. I'll be there." "Goodbye, sir. Thanks again." Goodbye Sergeant. Stephen again? We can't be sure yet. Come in. Cassie says you wanted to see me uncle Henry. Yes Elizabeth, I want to have a talk with you. Hello aunt Evelyn. Come in dear. You probably haven't seen this room before, have you? Oh yes. This is where you keep your books is it? - Some of them. I think I'd better go. All the guests will be arriving. Sit down, Elizabeth. I do hope you're going to like being here with us. Yes, thank you uncle Henry. That's good because your mother would be glad to hear that. It's very kind of you and aunt Evelyn to have me stay here with you. It's only right that you should. We hope and believe that we know what is best for you. Yes, that's what father said when .. When did he say that? A long time ago. Are you sure? Yes, uncle. Elizabeth, are you certain you don't know where your father is? Yes uncle Henry. Because a man is coming here tomorrow who particularly wants to contact him. I won't know what to tell him. Is it about a big business deal? It may be. It's about a very important inquiry, so .. Did you forget what your father said? - I never forget anything father says. He says I've got a memory like an elephant. We once had a joke about an elephant. An elephant? - Yes. Tell me about it. - Shall I? Yes. - Well .. I had come home late from the dancing class. And father was there waiting for me very annoyed. He said: "you needn't bother about making excuses". "I don't care what made you late. Not even if it was an elephant." But why was that so funny? It really was an elephant. - A real one? Yes. It was being led down the street. The people were watching and the crowds were simply terrific. Sure they were. Mother and father laughed like anything when I told them. It was just unreal. Really? - Yes. And father saying "you needn't bother about the excuses". And enough, when it was really an elephant. Very funny my dear. Henry. I hate to butt in like this, but have you any idea what the time is? It's my fault. We got talking. I forgot the time. Run up to bed, or you'll be tired for your dancing lesson tomorrow. Yes, aunt Evelyn. Good night. Good night uncle Henry. - Good night, child. Am I wrong in supposing that you didn't say anything to her? About her behaviour this afternoon? I explained matters to her. She saw the point. She was a bit confused, but she sees it now. Is that what you were laughing at when I came in? No, that was about an elephant. An elephant? How strange. So she has one. I very nearly bought her one at the toy shop at Victoria yesterday. No, this was a real one. I don't understand. Just a bit of fun, my dear. I'll explain later. I must go and dress. What about Stephen? Has she any idea where he is? No. Not in the least, I'm afraid. I don't understand Picasso. I mean I just don't understand. My dear, he would probably have the same difficulty in understanding you. Evelyn, what a wonderful idea for this party. Waiting about for these late-night benefit shows can be so tedious. Yes. Evelyn, I hear you have your sister's child staying with you. Most of us didn't even know you had a sister. Always had, darling. My dear, how is the kiddie-winks? Of course one daren't say anything to them. For fear of what their psychiatrists will pry out of them when they grow up. Well, I think children are only bearable when they're in bed and asleep. Do come in everybody. Clive is doing his conjuring tricks and you know what he's like if he's ignored. Don't be an idiot, darling. Oh come on, let's call it off. This is pure alcoholic inspiration. Come back here. Don't be a wet blanket, dear. Give that to me. - You'll be sorry for this. Not as sorry as you'll be tomorrow morning. You won't be there to see it. - Now darling, don't start again. Why, whatever are you doing here? I'm just posting a letter to my mother in hospital. What, at this time of night? The last post has gone hours ago. Give it to me. I'll post it first thing in the morning. And you'd better get back to bed before your auntie or uncle sees you. "Yes? What is it?" Is Mr Lorimer there, please? "No, he's not here now." But are you sure? "Call back in an hour." Alright. Thank you. Says what you said? Not to a friend of mine, she don't. Oh shut up. Good evening, Mrs Parsons. There's a package for you in the front room Mrs Sweetwater. Thank you. Come on. This is for you Mr Lorimer. Did they say who it is? - Sounds like a little girl to me. Elizabeth? Oh daddy, I'm so glad you're still there. I'm calling from a phone box. Look sweetheart, you're not to worry about mummy. She'll be alright. They're very clever people at the hospital you know. What did they say? "They said there wasn't much change." Surely aunt Evelyn called them? "Yes. Yes, she has." But please daddy, you must come round to uncle Henry's right away. Just as soon as you can. What an earth for? You didn't say I was in London, did you? Of course I didn't. Why should I see him? I don't understand exactly. But there has been an inquiry about you. From Brighton. What sort of an inquiry? Something to do with your business I think. Uncle Henry asked me about where you might have gone. He says it's important. He does, does he. I wonder who got on to him. I don't know. But there's a man calling tomorrow who wants to get in touch with you. He didn't tell you who it is? Uncle Henry didn't say. But I expect if you were to get in touch with him, he'd tell you. I told you I couldn't possibly. Well, perhaps if you were to ring up? "No." "I know best, sweetheart." Of course, daddy. But you're not to worry anymore. I expect it was something I forgot when we left. "You know the terrible rush I was in." Yes. Alright then. And don't you worry any more. No I won't. But please daddy, need I go on pretending to them? Look sweetheart. I wouldn't ask you to do this if it wasn't terribly important to me. And to mummy. You'll do that much for us, won't you. Don't worry daddy. I'll keep it a secret. I won't tell a soul. No matter how much they ask. Good girl. I knew I could rely on you. Goodbye then daddy. I must get back. Don't worry my baby. Is your car very far away? Goodbye, Evelyn. - Thanks for a lovely evening. See you anon. - Alright. Goodnight. Darling, you're transporting the grass-widows tonight, aren't you. Yes. My dear, surely that's the little one over there. Elizabeth. What are you doing here? I have a headache, aunt Evelyn. I thought fresh air might make it better. Well, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be out alone this time of night. You'd better go in and ask Cassie for an aspirin or something. Yes, aunt Evelyn. Really, the kiddie-wink doesn't look at all well, dear. I do hope she's not sickening for anything. I'm sure she's quite alright. I think we ought to be going. I detest late entrances. We adore them, Henry. I think if we hurry now, we'll be late just the right amount. Won't we Evelyn? - Oh. Yes. Yes, of course, we must hurry. Be patient with her Henry. Sudden motherhood can be very trying. But a child doesn't go out in the night like that just because of a headache. It's as good a reason as any. Why go on about it Evelyn? The party was brilliant, the Opera was abominable. It was a very successful evening. Maybe I'm not the right person to take care of a child. Maybe you're not. - I had to do it for Grace's sake. Are you sure it was for Grace's sake? Who else would I do it for? Or was that one of your legal subtleties? It probably is, but I'd rather not discuss it. It's late and I'm tired. What about you, Sergeant? Ah, no thanks sir. I go very light on liquor. Don't stand on formality. A little soda? - No thanks. Besides, it's after opening hours. You're an understanding man, sir. Very well, my dear. I don't think you've met my wife. Detective Sergeant Taylor. Glad to meet you Mrs Acheson. - That's very nice of you. Do sit down. - Thank you. Have you found out what you wanted to know, Sergeant? Not yet, Mrs Acheson. Your husband said we should wait for you as Mr Lorimer is your brother-in-law. I'm afraid we know so little. We've not been in touch with him in recent years. Well, every little helps madam, as the saying goes. What about the little girl, sir? I spoke to her as you asked. She doesn't know anything about where her father is. You feel sure about that sir? As far as I can tell from the child's manner. Besides, if she knows anything, why should she try to conceal it? Hmm. And you think the same I suppose, Mrs Acheson? It was my husband who spoke to the child. What is the nature of your inquiry, Sergeant? Nothing too serious, I hope. In court Mr Acheson, I know you demand severe sentences for similar things. It could be fraud or embezzlement or both. Please continue Sergeant. - Certainly sir. Mr Lorimer it seems, was negotiating the purchase of a group of properties. For a syndicate he got together. It wasn't a very straightforward deal but all legal enough on paper. The deal should have been completed last week, but .. When his clients tried to contact Mr Lorimer to .. Find out what was holding it up .. He couldn't be reached. Our brother-in-law is not very precise or business-like but it doesn't mean .. They went to unusual lengths to find him, sir. He wasn't at the usual address. Didn't answer letters. In short he disappeared. He didn't leave any message or .. Any trace of the large sum of money the clients had advanced as down payment. In other words, being un-business-like isn't enough to explain his absence. We have a warrant for his arrest madam. We tried to interview his wife but .. I'm sorry to say the hospital said she was too ill. Yes, of course. Of course, there may still be a quite simple explanation for the whole affair. It's a question of where the money is, naturally. Naturally. You said over the phone that Mr Lorimer was in practice with you once. Was this for long? - About four or five years. Did you consider him to be a competent partner, sir? Sergeant, "competency" is such a difficult word to define, isn't it. Well, we all know you are shrewd about your fellow men, sir. Your reputation in legal circles .. - Sergeant. Mr Lorimer robbed my husband of a great deal of money. Is that correct, Mr Acheson? Yes, he had access to the firm's money. Of course it was about twelve years ago. I see. But you didn't take him to court? The money he took Sergeant, belonged to the firm. I was as liable as he was. I considered it more mismanagement than robbery. And you've no idea what he's been doing since then? None whatever. We haven't seen him since. That's the reason. Quite so. Do you hear from your sister at all, Mrs Acheson? An occasional letter. Do you recall where they were written from? Always from different places. Any from Hull? No, I don't think so. Why Hull, Sergeant? Well, we had a case like this in Hull the Christmas before last. A different name but the description fits. That's why I wanted to see your little girl. She might remember something about her father's movements in the last 2 years. I take it she is fond of her father, Mrs Acheson? She makes quite a hero of him. I'd like to see her now, if I may. I'd consider it a favor Sergeant, if .. She needn't know all the details. I'll do my best, sir. You can rely on that. Thank you very much. You see, there's something I haven't told you. Yes? Well, we've gone a little further in our investigations and we discovered that .. Come in. You rang, sir? Would you ask Miss Elizabeth to come here. Yes, madam. What else have you found out, Sergeant? Well, the .. Hospital authorities say that a phone call of inquiry is often put through. Of course. I phone the hospital myself. I'm very concerned about my sister. Your calls have been checked, Mrs Acheson. These calls come from public call boxes from here in London. The child? These calls are all in a man's voice, sir. The same voice. And flowers have arrived at the hospital for Mrs Lorimer. But with no card from the sender. Come in. Oh, Elizabeth. This is a friend of mine, Mr Taylor. He's come to try to clear up the big business deals your father spoke of. How do you do, Elizabeth? I want you to try and help me if you can. Come and sit down, dear. We've had an inquiry from one of your father's business friends in Brighton. And we want to get in touch with him. He didn't give you any idea where he might be? Well, he's had a lot of worry with mother being ill. I expect he forgot. I'm sorry about your mother. It's a bad time for all of you. That's what father said. You mean, when he had to go away? Yes, he just had to go. He travels about a lot, I expect. Yes, he loves it. You and mother go with him? - Hmm. And abroad sometimes on holidays. Quite a travelled young lady, aren't you. Did you ever go to Hull? Hull? I don't remember. I don't think so. Are you certain? Hull? Oh yes .. of course. That's where the elephant was I told you about, uncle Henry. Father Christmas's was riding it. I don't know why. Perhaps they were short of reindeer. Father said it was because Father Christmas was so fat .. He needed an elephant to carry him. I expect you miss him making jokes, don't you? Yes, I do. I expect he misses you too, and worries about you. Not now that he knows that I'm alright here. How does he know, Elizabeth? Answer him. Well. He must know I'm alright here, mustn't he. Or else, he would have come for me. Thank you, Elizabeth. That's all I wanted to know. Have you finished, little girl? - Yes, but the number was engaged. Then you won't mind if I make a call. We're out of order, and the butcher sent the veal chops without the kidneys. George, that's four-nil so far. Are you Newcastle United? No. I live in London. That's not what I meant. Where abouts? Over there with my uncle and aunt. I know who you are. Name's Elizabeth. How do you know? - Mum told me about you. She said that you weren't exactly pretty but you had the most wonderful red hair. I think it's more like a turkey. Well, at least I don't have freckles like lentils. Anyway, I don't know who your mother is. She Mrs McNally and I'm Peter McNally. Oh, now I know. Did you get any money from Button "B"? I got sixpence once. No, I was making a proper call. Daft things. Any good at football? Or can't you play? Of course I can, but .. Okay, you can be Manchester City. Come on, let's go over in the park. I can't. I have to make a phone call. I must. They sent my kidneys to Doctor Reynolds. Come on, play with me. - I can't. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. Elizabeth, I've been looking everywhere for you, love. I was just playing football, Cassie. Football? Of all the things. Oh, it's you is it? Yes. Care to join us? You can be goalie. You're a little caution and no mistake, aren't you. Your uncle's asking for you, and I've come to get you love, so come on. Oh, no please. Can't I stay in the park a while? He's going to the hospital to see your mum and he wants you to go with him. Oh yes please. I didn't know that was it. Come on. - Peter, I'm sorry I can't .. That's okay. Girls are not much good anyway. Young rat. They're all the same no matter what their age. Hello. It's alright Cassie, I'm here. Hello, Vera. No. Just got a bit of a headache, that's all. Yes .. Oh, really? In the park? But, did Peter actually hear her phone? Yes, yes. You're quite right. She is very worried about Grace. No. I shall be alright. I'll just lie down for a bit. Yes, goodbye. Oh, hello sir. How are you today? - Fine, thanks. Can I help you? No, I'll look round and pick something myself. Certainly. Can I help you sir? Yes please. What sort of flowers do you think your mother likes? Mummy likes all flowers really. - You go and choose a nice bunch. Would you care to write a card, sir? - Thanks so much. My mother's in hospital, over the road. Too bad. We must choose something bright to cheer her up. Oh, these tulips. Some of these? - Mummy will love them. And these ones too. They're very pretty. - How about daffodils to go with them? They're very fresh. They make a lovely show. Have you made your selection yet, sir? No, not yet. Would you like one bunch or two? Oh, I didn't ask you how much you wanted to pay. There you are Elizabeth. You find what you wanted? I was just asking your little girl how much she'd like to spend. That's alright. Would you wrap them up please and put the card in. I think we'll hurry along, don't you? Yes. Mrs Lorimer. Mrs Lorimer? I'm very sorry, sir. No visitors allowed for Mrs Lorimer. When I phoned earlier they said it would be alright. I'm sorry. Doctor's orders. Nothing serious? - We have no information yet. Would you care to phone later perhaps? - Thank you. Can we see mummy now? I'm sorry, dear. Your mother's asleep. We can't disturb her. When can we see her? - Perhaps tomorrow. Sorry, darling. Shall we go? Oh please. Would you give these to my mummy when she wakes up. Madam. The master and Miss Elizabeth just got back from the hospital. I told him you wanted to see him. I expect he'll here in a minute. Yes. I do hope your headache soon gets better, madam. Thank you, Cassie. If anybody rings, I'm not at home. And you might keep Elizabeth in the kitchen with you. Oh, she said she wanted to go and play in the park before tea. And I thought I'd let her. No, I want her to stay with you. Understand? Yes, madam. Cassie tells me you have a bad headache. Racking. How was Grace? We weren't allowed to see her. - Why not? I'm afraid they didn't tell us very much. I wonder if it's serious? - I'll call the hospital later on. What did you tell Elizabeth? Just that Grace was asleep. If anything goes wrong, I'm not the one to tell her. Stephen should do that. She knows where he is. I still don't believe that, you know. - You'll have to believe it, Henry. I think she was confused by all the questions that Taylor put to her. She phoned Stephen this afternoon. From here? - From the phone box in the park. You actually saw her? - No. Vera McNally told me. I tell you Evelyn, if you believe everything that woman says .. It was her boy Peter who saw her. She told him that she had an important phone call to make. But they don't know each other. Or do they? He apparently recognized her by the color of her hair. And how did the boy detective deduce that? Vera described it to him. With her usual accuracy of course. So, out of all the red-headed children in London, he had to pick on Elizabeth? As they only live a few houses along the road, it wasn't very difficult. Henry, don't do this to me. I know it was Elizabeth. I've been over and spoken to the boy myself. Did he actually hear her make the call? No. Apparently Cassie came over and told her that you wanted her. Before she even had time to warn Stephen. You're terribly keen to make a complete villainess of that child, aren't you. For the greatest legal philosopher in England .. .. you're very keen to excuse lies and deceit being used to shield a criminal. As a legal philosopher, I don't decide if a man is a criminal until he's tried. Of course, you had to find an excuse to hate Stephen. Because you hadn't the courage to marry him when you loved him. That's not true. Evelyn, please. Whatever my shortcomings as a romantic swain .. And I know they must have been numberless, I was never blind. You picked on me, because I was headed for success. Stephen was pure charm and all failure. You loved him, but you loved my prospects better. Why are you bringing all this up now? It's ridiculous to hear you call something "love" .. That I knew even then was mere useful infatuation. What's this to do with the child's behaviour anyway? If you had married Stephen as you had really wanted to .. Elizabeth might have been your daughter. No. Now I suppose you're blaming me that we never had a child? I blame you for swindling me into a loveless marriage. You chose me because I was a good choice as a husband. But you never game me a single moment of that one indispensable thing: real love. Our marriage was bound to be barren. Your hatred of this child is a natural outcome of an unnatural life. Henry. I can't allow you to do this to yourself. It was the same when you let him get away with stealing from you that time. Because you wouldn't admit you envied him. And it's happening all over again. You have to love the child to prove that you are capable of it. And she's using you in exactly the same way her father did: lying and deceiving. She is Stephen, all over again. But you prefer not to see it. But I'll prove it to you. You'll prove nothing. We speak different languages and have done for 14 years. In 4 days, a child, whose only crime is loyalty and devotion to her parents .. Has shown me how utterly futile and inhuman this household has become. I still hope to live a few more years. I still treasure my humanity. Henry, what do you mean? Simply, that I've taken a clear look both of us. I do not care for the view. But I'll prove that I'm right about Elizabeth. I'll prove it. The more you try, the more you'll prove the opposite. Where are you going? - I don't know yet. You're not going to create a scandal. Might be interesting. One, one .. two, three. One .. two .. three. Here. There's something gone wrong here, isn't there? Try the other leg. Bert will be surprised when I do this in the middle of the Mad Boat tonight. Ooh. Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. That's alright, Cassie. Please don't stop. Miss Elizabeth is showing me what they learn her at her dancing school, madam. Was there something you wanted? - It's my headache. I wondered if you would to the chemist and get the powders he makes up for me. Yes, of course I will, madam. And will the master be in for dinner tonight, madam? I expect so. Why? Oh, I just thought I heard him go out. That's all. Aunt Evelyn, if you've got a headache, would you like me to go out and play? That's not necessary dear. I expect it will go soon. Anyway, I must go over to Mrs McNally. She did some shopping for me today. You won't mind being left alone here, will you? Oh no. And if the telephone rings you might try and take a message. Alright. I often do at home. Elizabeth. Who are you calling? Nobody, aunt Evelyn. I just wanted to see how it worked. The same as the callbox in the park? Except for putting in the pennies. I wanted to see. So I could ring up the hospital and see how my mother is. Just now you said it was nobody. It was your father you were trying to ring, wasn't it? No. Elizabeth. I want you to tell me where he is. Did you hear me? Yes, aunt Evelyn. - Then why don't you answer? I know where he is. It's no use. Your father's in London and you've been telephoning him. I know that now, you see. I thought as much. There's no sense in keeping it a secret any longer. Even if you did make a promise to your father. You can't hope to keep it any more than he keeps his promises to other people. Father always keeps his promises. If you believe that, it's time you knew the sort of man your father really is. I do know. He's not only dishonest. He's a cheat and a swindler. He robbed your uncle of a lot of money and could have gone to prison for it. Now the police are after him. It's no good keeping a promise to a man like that. Is it? I won't tell you. I won't. - You will. Because of your lies, your uncle has gone away and may never come back. I can't. I promised. Then you do know where he is? Have you got his address, or only his telephone number? I have to go. I want to go to my room. - You're going to stay here, Elizabeth. Look what you've done. You've broken it. It won't play anymore. Is this your father's telephone number? Is it? Tell me. - I won't tell you anything. Very well then. I'll go to the police and see what they have to say. Give it to me. Give it to me. It's mine. You don't believe me. It isn't daddy's telephone number, it isn't. Please .. please .. please. Why, whatever is going on? Oh Cassie .. Baby, what's wrong? Oh, there, there. Don't take on so. Whatever has upset you, love? Aunt Evelyn has taken daddy's telephone number. And she said she's going to tell the police. Police? Oh, she must have got it wrong. Whatever about? She said daddy was a cheat. And that he'd robbed uncle Henry of a lot of money. Well, there's been no burglaries since I've been here. Oh, I expect it's a bit of a misunderstanding. Your auntie does get a bit tetchy at times. Come on. Oh, you're back. Good. Madame, your headache powder. - It's better thanks. I must go out now. Please don't let Miss Elizabeth leave the house. Yes, Miss. And she's not to use the telephone under any pretext whatsoever. No Miss. Well. She's going to do what I said. - It may not be what you think, dear. She's probably gone to meet your uncle somewhere. No. She said he'd gone away and might never come back. Well. These last few days have been a real muddle and no mistake. Oh well. You come and tell us some more about professor Topolski. Oh please help me, Cassie. I must find daddy and let him know. She said you weren't to use the telephone. Still. What's his number? It began with K-I-L. I don't remember the rest. Well, just the exchange isn't much good, dear. Don't you know any of the numbers? Eight .. I always used to look at the piece of paper when I wanted to telephone him. Oh dear. Look. Do you know where he lives? Not far from professor Topolski's. Cassie, let's go there. I'm sure I can find it once we get to the bus stop. Yes, but what if your auntie gets back unexpected? Let's go Cassie, please. It's all very well for you but it's more than my job's worth. Still. I was thinking of leaving anyway. Come on. Look, it's no good doing things by half. We'd better get a taxi. They are so expensive. - Never mind. I'll see to that. Not that there's likely to be one about. There never is when you want one. Here. Taxi. Taxi! Now, we want to go to .. Oh dear, I'm not quite sure where it is. Do you know Maida Vale? Like the palm of my hand. Which part? It was just off a dancing school. - Would you know it if you saw it? There's an old church with a tall steeple. It's opposite it. Yes. That sounds like it will be Rudolph Road. Hop in. Keep the change. Well, there's the church and that's the steeple. Which is the house? They all look alike to me. Oh, now I remember. It's number 3. My lucky number. Well, there it is. Right opposite. Might be my lucky number. Ah well. The bell's working, anyway. Can't say I'd like to live here. Still, if your dad don't stay in any place for long, I suppose it's alright. Yes, what is it? - Is Mr Lorimer in, please? He was a while back. Is he expecting you? Yes, it's alright. It's a special invite. First floor, back. Daddy? Elizabeth. What are you? Yes? Oh, this is Cassie, daddy. She came with me to help find you. You'd better come in. - Will I wait outside, sir? Miss Elizabeth wants to talk to you private. I see. Well, thank you for looking after her, Cassie. A pleasure, I'm sure, sir. Daddy. - Sweetheart. You didn't come because we couldn't talk in the flower shop this afternoon. You understood, didn't you? Yes, because uncle Henry was with me. But that isn't why. I tried to phone you after the inspector came, and the number was engaged. Inspector? When I tried again, aunt Evelyn came out and found me. Oh no. You shouldn't have called me from the house, sweetheart. She didn't get the number, did she? - Yes. She snatched the bit of paper from me. I tried to stop her. But she took it with her. She said she was going to the police. Listen sweetheart. This has put daddy in rather a spot. I know it might sound mysterious but .. it's alright, I promise you. As soon as mother's well again I'll come and fetch you, just like I said. As soon as I've got this silly old business of mine fixed up. Take me with you, please. - Listen darling. I don't care what you've done, truly. But take me with you. But, darling, I can't possibly take you with me. Daddy, I don't know what it's like and I'll never see you again. Hush, baby. Hush for a while. I want to go with you. Isn't that enough? Hush, baby. Try to understand. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Open up. It's me. Oh, sir. I've just looked out. And Mrs Acheson's getting out of a car with some men. One of them is a policeman. Daddy. Daddy! Look after Elizabeth for me, Cassie. He's got two people with him, now. And I'm not sure that he wants to see anyone. Quite so. We just want to have a few words with him. Daddy, where you going? The other way out, sweetheart. Open up, Lorimer. Jennings, cover the back. Phillips. Get me something to break this door down. Daddy, daddy, no. Elizabeth, let me go! - No, no. Daddy. Daddy. You'll hurt yourself. Daddy. Wait for me. Daddy. Oh, daddy. Through that alleyway, Jennings. Did daddy say where he was going, little lady? He didn't say a thing. Elizabeth. You must tell them. I won't. I hate you. You're the meanest person I ever met. You made my daddy run away. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you! Jennings. It's no use, inspector. We're too late. Alright. Come around the front. Where is Elizabeth? The little girl? She just ran down the stairs. And the sooner everyone goes, the better. A nice name I shall get. Standby here. She's run away. Elizabeth's run away, sir. Jennings, did you see the little girl go down that way? No, sir. Well, get up to that corner then. Does she know her own way home? - I think she does, sir. No, no. There's nothing yet. Hold on. It's Mrs Acheson again. Ask her what she wants. He's a little tied up. Is there any message? Certainly, Mrs Acheson. She's on her way home now. If there's any news will you phone her there. Okay. Wait. Stephen. I've come back for my daughter. I .. She is .. Elizabeth's not here. - What do you mean? Come in. No need for us to stand here. Come into the house. Where is she? She ran away. Just after you did. What do you mean? What's being done about it? Have you called the police? Yes. They've been called. They're doing everything they can. They've told me that they'd ring me here. That's why I came home. Oh, Stephen. I'm glad you came back. You're glad? I was five minutes away from freedom. From a new life. I saw my plane taxi onto the runway. It was a great delivering angel ready to take me to my own special paradise. After I got there, I told myself I'd send for my wife. And my child, Elizabeth. They'd join me in .. Paradise. Stephen. I called the hospital from the airport. They talked as if Grace were dying. Oh no. She's been put on the critical list. They are going to try some kind of an operation. Poor Grace. You see now, don't you? Why I couldn't leave my child without a home. With you. I know. You know? Do you really know? - Stephen, you should understand. It's possible to act inhumanly for the most human reasons. Is that your excuse? No. I can think of a thousand excuses for myself. But I have to put them in the back of mind, not to believe them. Have to? You're sorry. So much. I had a new experience today. I found out what it was like to be hated. I've never really seen hate before. And then .. twice .. in one day. I saw if from two different people. From Henry. And from Elizabeth. The poor baby. You are sorry. Not for yourself. For what you've done. Stephen. Look at us. A handsome pair. That's what everybody said. Remember? Those two have got it all, they used to say. Yet when a child asks us for help .. We have nothing to give. I always wanted to be so right about everything. I've been so wrong. Oh madam, it's you. Did you hear? - Yes, Cassie? They've found the little one. They tried to phone you but you weren't here. So I ran looking for you. She went to the hospital. Mr Acheson's going to fetch her. We just didn't know where you were. Good news Cassie. - Oh, yes. I'll get her something to eat for when she gets back. I don't suppose she'd had a bite to eat all day. I shall be glad to see the dear little thing again. She'll be glad to see you, sir. Where are you going? - To the hospital. Stephen .. can they send you to prison? I expect so. Then, don't you think that I should .. - Evelyn. If the worst comes to the worst .. Who else can tell her about Grace? Yes. Yes. Of course. And she must know that her father didn't really run away from her. Yes. She must. I wanted to find out about my wife. Mrs Lorimer. Mrs ..? Oh yes .. They've just brought her out of the operating theatre. I'm afraid there's no report yet. I see. You haven't seen a little girl? - Daddy! Oh, I thought you ran away. No. 0nly for a little while. Mummy's been terribly ill. - I know. But she's going to get better. They said so. Didn't they, uncle Henry? They seem quite sure. Their medical miracle has worked. You ought to be able to see her in a few days. Don't cry, daddy. You know darling, you and I are the luckiest people in the world. You know? The absolute luckiest. Yes. Because mummy's going to get better. And you didn't run away after all. I don't know how I even thought of it. And Henry. It's been a long time since the family reunion. Much too long, Stephen. I hope the next one won't be too far away. I hope so, too. I don't think we've met. No. I'm detective Sergeant Taylor. Stephen Lorimer. Well. Evelyn's waiting for you two back at the house. Both of us? Yes, Henry. I wonder Sergeant, if you'd give me permission to go with them? I have to explain to my brother-in-law and to my daughter that .. It's possible for people to make mistakes. To be sorry. And even to profit from the experience. That's something worth a little time don't you think, Sergeant? If it's alright, I'll bring Mr Lorimer down to your place, tomorrow morning. Certainly, Mr Acheson. If you guarantee it. I do. Come on you two. We mustn't keep Evelyn waiting. -(t-g)-
