The other wing Of neither silk nor wood nor bleeding light... An enthusiastic crowd gathered at the airfield to witness the exploits of the famous aviator Raymat. It's for her line and her light that Hélène Tarnière was so dearly loved by the aviator Raymat. Hélène Tarnière: Ms. Marthe Ferrare Costumes by Poiret Raymat: André Bertoux - For our sake... be careful, my friend. It was her entire reason for existing that burned down with the smoking wreckage. Everything had become gloomy at Hélène's house, once one of the glories of Parisian salons. Hélène did not cry, but the human torch that was ablaze in the skies was still ablaze in her aching eyes. Madam, thank you for thinking of Raymat's friend to help you find the rest you seek. I won't presume to discuss your decision But I'm afraid of this life for you, a beautiful life, but a rough one. In any case, come when you please and do me the honor of trusting the total devotion of your servant. Robert Vraie. Only the Countess of Aibet was granted access to her. The Countess of Aibet: Mrs. Claude France - What do you want me to become?... There was a time that I would've buried my pain in the silence of a convent. - Today, as a modern woman, I rely on action to help me forget the pain. In the camp of the flying priests. Robert Vraie: Mr. Jean Murat - My life, my energy, all that I have left, I offer it to the place that killed my love. - I will be stronger than him. - I have already given up my life as a woman for good. That is not what scares me. And Hélène Tarnière locked up her suppleness, destroyed the elegance of her lines in a work suit. You know Gaston Lager... a lifelong friend... an enthusiast. Gaston Lager: Charles Vanel Mrs. Diana. (Ms. Mary Harald) Do you really think you are cut out for this life as a boy? - It's your first journey in the air... Are you ready? - The air has done me all possible harm, it can do nothing more to me. - Another blowhard! - Head towards the sun, don't change directions... head towards the sun... it's burning like a great fire. Active life brought some relief to Hélène Tarnière. - See to it that you don't hunt on my lands, will you? It was the eve of the day she was to fly solo for the first time. - The fool!... He looks rather annoyed! - So touching! - I'm not fooled by your grand airs... Don't think that you are the queen of aviation yet. - Are you still mad at me? Because of you... I can't live with Diane anymore... she knows that I admire you... A blind resentment, multiplied by jealousy, pushed the dancer to criminal insanity. - Idiot, I'm only doing this to prevent Hélène from flying and may be killing herself. Do you want me to believe that it's not jealousy that made you do this? - You won't say a word, will you? The next morning, the directors visited to the camp on the occasion of Hélène's first flight. - My dear Vraie, a splendid acquisition... Great publicity for us! - We didn't sleep all night... What a party my friend! - Good heavens... my dear... Looks like you're going to fly too. Hélène's growing fame had aroused the interest of a large competitor. - At any cost... we must get this Hélène Tarnière to come work for us. - God, you are beautiful! - Let me go... Up there... Up there... Look... in the murderous air... - Look at the burning sun... There is a man's face in the middle. Reporters from major newspapers sought the honor of interviewing of the star of the moment. ... and if you would be kind enough to fix an appointment with us, we'll let you know about the brilliant contract that we are ready to sign to have you head our team of high-flyers. The management, L. Lirard - Think about it!... But it's all the gold and glory possible that they are offering you. - Are you crazy? HÉLÈNE TARNIÈRE: QUEEN OF THE AIR Her admirers and friends Mud on the wings - Trust me, I'll write you an article on this Tarnière that people will talk about. On that subject... Diane wants to fly too. - Hey! Diane is as good as that show-off Hélène. And yet the fraternity between these two men bore the seal of glorious sufferings that they had experienced together. - You're the reason for this too! - You were wrong... I know how to defend myself and had I known that it was for me... - I call the shots here, and you will leave the camp immediately. The new Paris-Nice airline had the industrial circles excited. - You have my promise. We will make Diane de Kenn an aviator who will overshadow Hélène Tarnière. - We have only one serious competitor, it's Robert Vraie. - I'll take care of him! - You don't understand that one of our biggest orders depends on this airplane duel. - Our reputation is at stake... and so is your courage. - An aviator is not a jockey you bet on... and my courage has soared over battlefields too many times for you to doubt it. ...Your stupid love that your mechanics make fun of... ...You are the only one that doesn't notice her feelings for Lager... A friend. - Well! It's a deal, I accept the challenge. - Me too... I want to take part in the contest... - Coward! - Coward!!! Sign me up for the contest; Ours will not be a duel of airplanes; There will be no mercy up there. It will be just you and me. What a pity!... Some new villainy... anonymous probably... - It is better that I leave the camp. - Hélène, then you will never understand what I go through... I love you...I... - No... No, you mustn't love me, Robert... My heart was consumed with that of another man that the fire devoured. - What is she crying for?... Her former love... or the one she is resisting? - It's a real tournament, it will be terrible and beautiful... We must win. - What's the matter?... Are you scared of Gaston Lager? - Come and see if I'm scared... - This is madness, we can't make sense of it... Looks like he wants to kill himself... - But it's perfect, it's great publicity, tomorrow, all the newspapers will know that our airplanes can fly in the storm. - Yes... it's not the man that interests you, it's the machine. - I won't go... I promise. But Hélène didn't have to fly. ...We just learnt that no male aviator agreed to compete in the air with a woman, and accepted Hélène Tarnière's challenge - So, are we agreed?... It's your airplane that has burned down, Hélène... The day of the contest was finally here. Isn't that Gaston Lager's airplane up there? The contest was to end with a night performance; Journey between Paris and Nice, round-trip the same night. - It's a sabotage... Your plane was set on fire just to divert attention. Robert suffered a lot, but nothing essential of his modern athlete's body had been destroyed. - Step on it, Drive her to the devil... - Hélène... I'm happy... You're here. - Hélène... Are you crying? Why?... - Robert... my friend... the other wing... of neither wood nor silk... but that of love... It isn't broken, is it? .... wing of love and life. - Canudo
