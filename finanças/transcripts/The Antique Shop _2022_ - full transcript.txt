Yeah, I know, I know. After visiting the antique shop, I will go straight to the airport. It won't take long, okay? See you. Why don't you try looking at those old plates or bowls? Singaporeans like to look at them. How do you know that I'm a Singaporean? I have met a lot of people to know where they are from. If you're interested in any pieces, just let me know. They are all antique. And all have their own story behind them. Pick one. I will tell you a story. Alex, come and help me here. Numerous people have died on this chair, but only one, different from the others. He is an Indonesian. Entered to work in Thailand as a driver. Like everyone, he wanted to get an honest job. But he never thought that… it would bring him to the dark side of Bangkok. To survive a near-death situation, first thing is to leave the fear behind. I did ask him. Damn, what do these Indonesians eat to make them so tough? I can't get a single word out of him. Of course. I've been beating him and kicking his guts out. Yes. I checked. He's Boss Chai's driver. Krit! He's coming around. Okay, I'll try again. Yeah. Waking up? Don't just stand there. Lift him up. This guy is as huge as a buffalo. Come on. Now. It's time to tell me, where is my stuff? Can I have more time? I have to take this job to make some money for us. I will come back for you. I promise. And you just let him? Where's the stuff I asked you to get? Did you listen to us? Did you listen to us talking? I don't understand Thai, sir. I have a job for you. It needs someone new. Go to this location and pick up a package. And this is money for your job. Boss, I told you before. I don't do this kind of work. Right now, you are the one I trust the most. Hey! What's that? Don't even try! Walk! Hey! Krit! Why did you shoot him? Don't yell at me, asshole. But you're being loud! You're fucking louder. Hey, hey! Get up! Get up! Move! Move! Now what? Ask him, dumbass. Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. He said he doesn't know. Doesn't know, my ass! Everyone knows it's you. All right. If you don't wanna die, tell me, where is my stuff? You don't think I have the guts to do it? Tell me or fucking die! That's enough! If he dies, how can we find it? He's not going to die, damn it! Have you ever beaten someone, asshole? Fuck, it's him again! Yes, boss. I did ask him. Damn, what do these Indonesians eat to make them so tough? I can't get a single word out of him. Of course. I've been beating him and kicking his guts out. Yes. I checked. He's Boss Chai's driver. When I find my drugs, I'll blow your brains out. Krit, it's getting dark. Let's take him somewhere else to force him to talk. Are you chickening out? As if you'd never been here at night before. Krit. People say… that when someone dies, their spirit will return after three days. Aren't you scared? If you want to leave, make him talk first. I've been slugging him for hours while you just stand there and watch. Hey! Where is my stuff? Hey, listen! Look at me! What the hell are you looking at? Tell me or fucking die! You almost hit me. What? Did you throw something at me? No, I didn't! You're so creeped out that this shit gets into your brain. Dude, you know I'm scared. -It's not funny. -All right. Take it easy. The boss just texted me. He'll talk to Boss Chai first. I really don't know. I'm just a small-time peddler. I don't know how the cops found out. I'm not a rat. You can ask anyone. I'm just an office man. I just wanted to make some extra money! -Who's that? -The boss, of course. Yes, boss. Are you still with the Indonesian guy? Yes. I found the packages he stashed in the restroom where you got him. Okay. Chai said he had quit the driver's job. He knows nothing about the drug. What do you want me to do with him? What did he say? He found the drugs. Then let's get out of here. Not so fast. Let's kill him first. I will come back for you. I promise. What's wrong? It's jammed. Shit! Doung, what are you waiting for? Shoot him! Come on! Things you haven't done. Never encountered a situation. Something unexpected happened. Those we normally fear. If you are in control of yourself and try to understand them, the fear will fade away. It is a way to control your fear. The only survivor is him. From then on, no one dares to kill anyone at that place again. Is it really true? I never thought there are such things in Thailand. I heard it from someone else. Objects. The more stories they have, the more valuable they are. This bracelet. Is there any story behind it? Very observant. Do you wanna know who this bracelet belongs to? The person wearing the bracelet… would always hear a voice saying, "Help me." "Help me!" The owner of the bracelet is a Singaporean. Just like yourself. But one day… he suddenly disappeared. His girlfriend kept this bracelet. And she would always hear his voice ringing every time she wears it. Help me! You hear something? I heard that he is trapped somewhere in Thailand. Do you want to hear the story? Have you ever heard of "replacement death"? I believe that's what happened to my friend. Did you and your friend go back to that abandoned house? Hell no! A ghost followed my friend all night. We'll never go back there. Well, be warned, guys. Don't take any unnecessary risks. Just a reminder, ghosts are everywhere. No need to go ghost-hunting. -Hello! -Sarge, hurry up! Hey. Hey! Hello! Hey! Hey, get me out of here. Hello! Hey! -Hurry up! -Hey! Hey, can you hear me? Hey! Help. Help me! GET ME OUT OF HERE Hey! Can you hear me? There's something in here. Hey, help me out. There's something-- He should be okay. I gave up everything I had for you. And this is how you treat me. You cheated on me. When he wakes up, make sure he pays for the damage. Open the door! Help! What happened? How did it happen? He had blood coming out of his ear. So I went out to get help. When I returned, he had stopped breathing. Sarge, hurry up! Yes, sir. We only have eight minutes to save him. Hurry up! It's almost eight minutes! Listen to me. You are misunderstanding me. Hey, Ryan. Ryan, I think you are misunderstanding me. My ex just consulted me about his problem. There is nothing between us. Please say something to me. Hey, Ryan. Ryan! Wrong number. Well, be warned, guys. Don't take any unnecessary risks. Just a reminder, ghosts are everywhere. No need to go ghost-hunting. Hello. Get me out of here. Hey. Hey! Can you hear me? Get me out of here. Hey. No one ever saw him again? That Singaporean man? This prison has many stories. Not only does it lock people up, but it locks up souls as well. Someone met him, but he could not speak English. He only spoke Thai. And he could not remember all his life in Singapore. As if he was a different person. Because they are completely different persons. How is it possible? Someone said that… the soul that entered his body is not his own. So where is his soul now? It seems like you're more interested in the story than the antique. Are you interested in these beautiful knives? Try picking one. How are those interesting? It's just knives. For you, it's just a knife. But for its previous owner, they are anger and revenge. There is a Korean man. All his life, he only thinks about two things. Anger and revenge. And every time he wants to revenge, he will buy a knife and collect it. So, how many knives do you think he has at home? Five. No one knows how many knives he has at home. Once he gets revenge, he will bring the knives and sell them here. Do you know how many knives I have? Let me tell you the story. Then you will know how many knives there are. Tonight is the second of February. It's my birthday tomorrow. At the party tomorrow… there'll be three friends of mine who ruined my life. I want them… to know the consequences… of all the things… they did to me. Win, cut it out. You're getting on my nerves, jackass. Buy a new car, will you? It's fucking hot in here. If you want to sit in a comfy car, why don't you take out your posh car? You insisted I pick you up and now you insult my car. Fucking dumbass. You're really angry, aren't you? Big mouth is complaining. -I'll shut your mouth with this. -Fuck you. -Asshole. -It stinks. What the hell! Shut up and buy a new car. I'm curious. Why did he return to Thailand? Korea is a lot better. Yeah. If I were him, I'd never set foot here again. Don't you think it's kind of weird? We used to bully Song a lot back then. Now he invites us to his birthday party. What the fuck, Win! Watch the road, bitch. -Fuck you. -I'll smack you again. Sure you know how to drive? This area looks so deserted. There it is. It's huge. Where's everyone? Follow her. Bring them in. Welcome. Food is ready. Nice to meet you. I will set up the table. Wait! What about the others? No. Just you. Lame. Watch this. -Show off. -Chill. Guys, this is weird. I texted almost everyone. No one knows about Song's birthday. Tae, back in high school, he didn't have any friends. We're probably his only friends. Friends, my ass. Don't you remember? We made his life hell. Tae, you're overthinking. That was ages ago. No one gives a damn now. Damn it! -Damn. So creepy. -What's so fucking creepy? Shit! Hey! Is dinner ready? What the fuck! Hey, girl. Hey! Can you hear me? Why don't you invite some others on your birthday? If you have something to talk with us, say it! Hey! Are you deaf? We're asking you questions. Should we beat him up now? He's getting on my nerves. Calm down, dude. I want to clear up some issues during the high school year. It has been a long time. We should talk about it. So, there will be nothing left in my mind. Hey. I have nothing left in my mind. But bullying you was fun. Don't you think about inviting us for revenge? Just kidding, boy. If you want to leave, you should finish your steak first. Fuck, it's like he's not human. Why don't we beat him up now? Tae, you're freaking out or what? He cut himself and didn't even flinch. Don't you think it's unusual? Dude, when we bullied him, he never screamed. He's probably used to pain. Agreed. He knew that if he winced or cried, we would come down on him harder. It became his habit pretending he feels no pain. Yeah. I'll leave after I finish eating. No fucking way. We came together, so we'll leave together. Tae, listen to me. If he invited us here to get his revenge, I'll beat him up before he gets a chance. Do you remember when I set his hair on fire? -Yeah. -One side of his head was scorched. Of course I remember. You shaved his head too. And I took the photos. Do you see now? We are a great team. Do you think he'll dare to get back at us? You've just posted an old photo of his shaved head on the alumni's group. I think it pissed him off. If you're such a coward, I can't stop you. But don't try to scare us. Hey! Calm down, Champ. You know what he's like. Hey. What the fuck? -Is it blood? -What is it? Where the hell is Song? What's taking him so long? I wonder what's up there. Song! -Hey! -Song! Fucking Song, where are you? Whose blood is it? Did you hear that? Hey, girl! Girl! Girl! Where did she go? Song. What the hell's with these balloons? Fuck, is this really Song's house? It doesn't look like someone lives here. Guys, I think we should leave. Not again. I have a bad feeling. Let's get out of here. You're such a wimp. Nothing's happened to us yet. Hey! Champ. -I heard something. -Champ. Come on. Guys, I think I better leave now. Come here. Stay close to me. Don't get a heart attack, okay? Here! Fuck you, Win. -Have a look. -Leave me. Fuck you guys. Cut it out, you two. Come on, I'm sorry. What are you so scared of? -Hands off me. -Easy, dude. What did you just say? Wanna punch me? Hey! Fuck! Shit! Fuck. What's this? -Have some. -You son of a bitch. -Fuck you. -Asshole. Fuck! Song! Shit! What the fuck is he saying? When did he record it? Yesterday. If… he's dead, then what we saw was his ghost? He's not going to let us out of here. Shut the fuck up, Tae. Champ! What are you doing? Making sure he's really dead. Don't you see he's fucking bloody? Shit! Who's that? Hey, Champ! Where are you going? Hey, Champ! Wait. I saw Song over there. Tae, you're delusional. Song is lying dead in that room. Where's that deaf girl? Did you hear that? Hear what? His spirit is taking revenge on us. Let's get out of here. No way. We have to call the cops and give a statement. You do it, but I'm leaving. Fuck, get back here. Listen to me! We'll tell the cops that when we got here Song had already killed himself. That easy, right? And the dinner? How can you explain that? But there's evidence that we've been here. If we don't call the cops, we'll look more suspicious. Wait, Champ. You're the only one who's left evidence. You stabbed his leg. You left your fingerprints there. Come. We'll clean up downstairs. No one will ever know we were here. Asshole, you're dumping it on me? You did it yourself! -Fuck you! -Bring it on, asshole. Fuck you! -Damn it! -What the fuck! -Hey! -What? Tae! Where are you going? I'm not going back in there. Give it to me. You two aren't going anywhere. You must clean up this mess. Fuck, you stay and talk to the cops. Do you want it? Take it. But if you don't help me, I'll tell the cops what happened at that bar. You. Especially you. You did something horrible. If I'm going down, you two are coming with me. So, you still want to leave? I'll wipe off my fingerprints from the knife. You two clean up all the evidence here. Then we'll leave together. He killed himself to become a ghost and haunt us. Shut up or I'll turn you into another ghost. Hey! Why did the lights go off? See? I told you. Champ! Win! Where are you? Tae. Where are you going? Win! Where are you? Hey! Tae, where are you going? Maybe he's looking for the fuse box. Come upstairs with me. What's with the darts? -Let go. -Tell me. Let go. What are they for? Help me. Help! Hey, Tae! What's wrong? Fuck you, Win. Help me. I'm so sorry. Back then, it was just fun. I didn't mean to hurt you. Champ was the one. And the fire incident with your hair. It was really an accident. We only wanted to burn your clothes. We didn't think it would get on your hair. -Tae! -Help me! Help me! -Tae, where are you? -Help me! -Tae. -Help me! Tae! Calm down. I'm coming. Help me. Tae, relax. I'm here. Help me, please. Help me! You made me eat rotten things. Remember? After that, you used a knife to shave my hair. Because you were scared that the teacher would see. You shaved without caring how much the knife was cutting into my head. My head was covered with blood. Hear me out. I can explain. Help! Hey! Help me. Help, please. Keep running, boys. All of you will die today anyway. Help me. Help me. Champ. You want to die? Let me help. I'm not gonna die. I'm not going easily. Fun. Right? Win. You're a murderer now. What is in the food? Some herbs have hallucinatory effects. But some of them let you take fun trips within your imagination. What the fuck are you saying? That won't hurt me. You guys never knew I have a disorder. I have never felt pain. Every time you guys bullied me, I never felt pain. But I felt pain from the revenge. That's the only pain I've got. And you know what? The most painful thing is… the pain that is locked inside my heart. Now you have become a murderer. You either die in jail or here. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! The police will be here soon. I want to know what you're gonna do. I… I invited them to my birthday party. They were so drunk. Suddenly, one of them went crazy and tried to kill everyone. I managed to escape from him. At the end, he just killed himself. Sarge, there's another body here. Such illness really exists? The disorder that makes you not feel anything? Feeling nothing does not mean you will not be in pain. Why is there an extra cup? Someone that we're thinking of has arrived. What brings you here again? Sit first. Do you want a cup of tea? I have something for you. Alex, let's check. You're the one who sold those knives to Madame? There are so many people who sell knives to Madame. But not everyone seems close with Madame. I see. Madame has already told you about my story. It's a way to create value for the antiques. Which means it's not true. Was it fun? Very interesting. So interesting that you forgot to go to the airport. -I'm late! -Wait. Will you bring something back with? I would like to have this bracelet. I think he wants to go home. It may be torturing for him to stay here. Between the torture of being trapped, and the torture from being hurt, which do you think is the most painful? The torture of not being able to break free from the pain. That is most painful. Okay. I will put it in a box for you. Hope to see you again. You're the first person who wants to see me again. Pick one. I will tell you a story. Subtitle translation by: Thanomjit Phanichrat
