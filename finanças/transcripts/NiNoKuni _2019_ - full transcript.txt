Again? Excuse me, sir! It's dangerous up there. Oh, it's you. I'm in the middle of invoking a spell. Don't interrupt me. That's fine, but go back to your room. Don't tell me you think I've gone senile. Of course not. Stop that! Let go. What if the spell is discharged? Tell me what sort of spell will discharge on a hospital rooftop? "Gateway." HOSPITAL Gateway? You mean gateball? Nitwit! I said Gateway! A spell that opens a door to another world. Hey, hey, hey! It's mine! There he goes! He's on fire today! Yes! -Way too aggressive! -Making excuses? Ready, everyone? Haru! Thanks. -Thanks for coming. -Good work. -Nice hustle! -Oh, man, he's so hot! Yu! Did you see Shinozaki's face? That felt good! Because he totally had you on lockdown last time. He was vulnerable to drives on his left, just like you said. But you were too impatient. If you'd driven more to the basket in the last period, you could have scored five more points. It was too bad. What do you mean? You could be more effective, but you don't think things through. It's quite frustrating. If I were any better, the number of fans would get out of control. Haru! Yu! I heard you won today's game. -Of course. -Hey, Kotona. So, what were you talking about now? About his "fans." Hey. Are you trying to cheat even though you're with me? What? -You have a track record. -I do not. Oh, yeah? Who had coffee with a first-year just because she got you a gift? There won't be a next time. You're mean. I'll let you off for today. By the way, I heard about a good crepe place. The orange crepe is supposed to be sour and amazing. Wanna go? There she goes. Kotona's love of sour oranges. I just really like them. Why not? Let's go celebrate your victory. I think it's close. The place is up there. -But let's go somewhere else. -Yeah, you're right. Okay. Time for the third wheel to leave. You two go ahead. Hey, Yu! Seriously, don't worry. I'm used to it. -Hurry up! -Wait! SAKI FLOWER SHOP -Welcome back. -I'm home. Welcome back, Yu. Thanks, Nanako. Solved it! I got it, right? Nice. I know. You could be more effective, but you don't think things through. It's quite frustrating. I guess I'm just frustrated about... something else. Oh, man. I feel bad for what I did to Yu. Let's all go next time. If we go the long way, Yu can go too. -Yeah. -See you tomorrow! Be careful going home. You too. Kotona? -Help! -Huh? What's wrong? Someone keeps following me! I'm scared! Where's Haru? We just split ways. He's not picking up! -Where are you now? -By the alley on First Street. Sis Saki, I need a ride! Oh, yeah. Kotona's birthday is just around the corner. YU Why isn't he picking up right now? What happened? -Kotona's in danger. -Danger how? I don't know, but some weirdo is following her. -Just hurry. -Okay. -Drop me off here. -Sure! Will you try contacting Haru? Sure. I'll try looking for her too. Kotona! Stop it! Kotona? Kotona! Kotona... Don't worry, you're fine. We'll call an ambulance. What happened? Haru, she was stabbed by someone. Kotona! Haru, you shouldn't move her! Let's call an ambulance! Shut up! Be quiet! What were you doing? -I... -I'm taking her to the hospital. Haru! Dammit! Haru, don't! Haru! Where the heck are we? -And what's up with this outfit? -Yeah. -Kotona's gone! -That's right. Kotona! Where's Kotona? Haru, your phone! Right! This is... a compass. What's going on? A dog? What a strange dog. -What happened? -They're in the middle of the road. I think we're attracting attention. -Let's move. -Yeah. There's less people over there. Yu! You... What? Hurry up, Haru. Look at your legs! I can walk? My legs... What's going on? You were just walking! Come on, try walking again. Yeah. How can it be? What's happening? No way! -Seriously, what's going on, Yu? -I don't know. I don't know, but... Where are we? Maybe it's a new high-tech theme park? Or maybe they're filming something? Then, what's that? Dinosaur robots. -A computer must be controlling them. -They look alive. Yeah, that's true. That metal seems too real for cosplay. It is real. What? It's really another world. -What the heck? -It's just a theory, but we've jumped into another world. Another world? Then is Kotona here too? That's right. Kotona... She was injured, right? -It was bad-- -Wait, Haru. As you can see, my legs are healed. Maybe injuries get healed in this world. Yeah! You may be right! -Worrying won't get us anywhere! -That's right. We need to act first. We'll find you, Kotona. This must be a pub. Can we go in? Don't be a prude. We're in another world. Whoa! This is a totally different world. Definitely. Hey, ma'am! Bring the drinks! Keep it coming! Here you go. But are you guys sure? It's the middle of the day. We're mercenaries. We're not needed when nothing's going on. Well, nothing beats peaceful times. Business is booming, right? I suppose. -It's full of drunkards. -Should we drink too? No, we should not. Now, guess we'll ask them one by one. No. We have to choose someone who seems easy to talk to. Hey, you. You're in my way. Move. A dog? He just looks like a dog. He's not a dog. You don't look familiar. Where are you from? From Tokyo. Tokyo? Never heard of it. He reeks of booze! Oh, well. Anyway, you have a question, right? Yes, please. You want to hear about my heroic tales? Good for you. -No... -That's not it. There I was, faced with an enemy of 200, with only my trusty battle ax... Sour! We're looking for someone. Who? Who? Well... A girl named Kotona. A girl? You cheeky brats. What the heck? Does she have a nice butt? All right. This Kotana lass with a nice butt, I'll help you search for her. Really? So, what does she look like? She has hair up to her shoulders, and she's kind. Her eyes are pretty big. That isn't gonna help at all! Race, eye color, and age. She's almost 17. Seventeen, eh? Ripe for the picking. Music to me ears. Seventeen? She's the same age as Princess Astrid. Princess Astrid? Her seventeenth birthday celebration is very near. She's grown into a fine woman. Time sure flies by. She's so beautiful. -It's Kotona! -We've found her. But this is Princess Astrid. Is Kotona the princess? I don't care. Where is the princess now? -In the castle, of course. -The castle? -Where is it? -Outside to the north. Everyone knows that. -There it is. -Hurry! But why is Kotona the princess? Maybe we're given random roles when we come to this world. So I guess we're townspeople A and B. But we don't know if it's really Kotona. We'll know when we see her. The castle is currently under special security. You can only enter by the king's direct orders! Excuse me, we've come to see Princess Astrid. Who are you? Townspeople A and B. Mere townspeople are certainly not allowed to see the princess. Be gone! Knight Commander Bertha, welcome back. I have arrived. Thank you. I heard the princess's condition took a sudden turn. Yes. She's not doing well. Can we do something? The only thing we can do is remain vigilant and keep our guard up. Right. Even the kingdom's prominent healers have thrown in the towel against such a strong curse. But those who harm the princess are supposed to suffer the same. Even with her Royal Aegis, the curse consumes her. This is quite perplexing. If even Magic Minister Gnauss Wisden can't undo the curse, it must be very powerful. How disappointing. Save your sarcasm. I am doing all I can. Barton, this is no ordinary curse. No fault lies with Gnauss. Sire. Master Zeelok's Order will be arriving soon. When it comes to curses, no one is better than them. Let us have faith, Sire. We are Master Zeelok's Order. We are here to see Princess Astrid. Let us through. Yes! Wait. We should be cautious. -Go! -Hey! A cat statue? The king's taste? Is it some great person from this world? It's like an animal kingdom. We thank you for coming all this way. If you can save the princess, the king is certain to reward you with the greatest of ranks. -We have high hopes. -Hurry! Yes, sir. Kotana! It really is Kotana. There's no doubt. Let us begin. That which is evil shall not stay That which hurts you shall fly away Sinister curses are no match for us Phantoms and demons all get crushed Here it goes My word! Princess... Please save her. What's the meaning of this? Princess... How could this be? Sire! Your Majesty, hold on! His exhaustion is showing. Barton, take His Majesty to his chamber. Sure. Kotona. She seems a little different. That can't be. If she's not Kotona, then who is she? You're right. We must save her. So what should we do? What? Oh, no! Haru, back up! What? An intruder! Yu, you... -You! -Princess! Step away from her! What's going on? What did you do to the princess? Who are you intruders? I'm Yu. This is Haru. Let us go! We didn't do anything wrong. Why were you in the princess's room? We were looking for our friend. The princess looks just like her, so we came to see her. What sort of nonsense are you spouting? Yu pulled out the dagger that was in the princess. You'd better come up with a better lie than that! Do you know how His Majesty was worried about the-- Father! -What they say is true. -Princess! It cannot be... Astrid! Father! -Astrid. -Father! Does this mean the curse is gone? I am sorry to have worried you. I, too, have indeed witnessed their actions. It's a miracle! She's right as rain! They are heroes, not intruders! How... Sire, in light of these men's work, I believe a show of gratitude is in order. You are right. I will reward these men. Reward? Now, release them. Kotona, you're... You're Kotona, right? Huh? Thank you for saving the princess today. My men will escort you to town. Take care in going back. Thank you very much. She sort of looks like Sis Saki. Oh, yeah? Hey! You're the townsmen from earlier! They are Princess Astrid's saviors. Show some respect! Yes, ma'am! It's them! -A white horse? -Real soldiers escorted you? We went to see Princess Astrid. What did you say? It's their treat. The princess wasn't Kotona. I see, so I resemble a friend of yours? I would like to meet her. Where in the world is Kotona? Where should we look for her? About that. I'm still concerned about the princess. What do you mean, Yu? I thought we were looking for Kotona. Yeah, but I'm not satisfied. What did you do back there? How were you able to do that? I don't know. My body just moved. When I got close, nothing happened. What are you saying? -It must be a dream. -Huh? We need to hurry and wake up from this childish dream. Is this really a dream? We received a reward too. I guess it doesn't matter if it's a dream. Well, let's just enjoy it until we wake up! Haru, wait! That's the spirit! You must be tired. You can stay here tonight. It's just a bed in the storeroom, but you're young, right? -Sure. -Your friend can stay too. I'll tell him later. It's just up those stairs. It's already unlocked. Haru... something just doesn't feel right to me. Good evening. -The hero from earlier. -Yes. I'm sorry, but I forgot something in the castle. What a free spirit. Must I go now? It is for your own protection. How many times must I tell you? His Majesty has instructed me to take you tonight, no matter what. Please think about my situation! But you mumble too much, Dandy. That's horrible! See? I'm totally fine now. All I need to do is eat my favorite sour oranges and I'll be good as new! She likes sour oranges? Just like Kotona. Who's there? Wait! The hero from earlier. Was your name Yu? Oh, yes. Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing. I'm sorry to drop in like this. It's fine. I wanted to talk to someone as well. Is that right? I don't know how to say this... but you look like an ordinary girl, Princess. Actually, I don't love behaving like a princess. I'm usually like that when no one is around. Hey, Handy! Time for take off! Right! It's ready to go. Well, well, Sir Hero. -Can we let him on? -We can. After all, the princess has agreed to go! Please come aboard. Now, to purge any evil spirit left in the princess, we are off to the the Lake of Purity! -Let's go. -Okay! Take off! Huh? Take off? It flies? Kotona... The wind is welcoming us. Yeah. So many birds. The Divine Bird Avnaron is said to be an ally of heroes. It is rare for them to appear in front of humans. This way, watch your step. Oh, right. I'm ready. Princess, if you do the magic-sealing dance correctly, you will be able to expel the evil spirits. I know. You practicing was well worth it. Thank you, Dandy. Then I shall go pick some wardweed. Yes, please do. This Miss Kotona you were talking about, does she look that much like me? Yes. You're both strong-willed and love sour oranges. What's different is... Kotona is Haru's... I see. You have feelings for Miss Kotona. Huh? No, it's not like that. Is Miss Kotona a princess? No, an ordinary high school student. There are no kings and princesses in our world. So you really are from a different world? Yeah. Our world and yours coexist as one, like two sides of a coin. The two worlds are connected somehow. Right. Many people know about the legend of your world, but no one has ever seen it. But if a world like that really exists, I'd like to see it. Oh, I know! Tell me more about Miss Kotona. Huh? Let's see. She's bright and says what's on her mind. She shares her energy with everyone. Oh! Just like you do when you talk with Dandy. I see. I don't think I have much energy to share with people. There are times when I feel lonely. My mother passed away when I was young. My father is the king, so I can't cry to him. Dandy is the only one I can be myself with. But you have so many subjects. Everyone is good to me. But... that's just because I am the princess. I don't have anyone I can laugh, cry, and argue with. Not like you and Haru. I envy your Kotona. Yu! Let's jump in! Princess? See? It feels nice! Okay! You want to test their powers? The power that released the curse is not an ordinary one. But it can't be. Those young men? The Black Banners have sent assassins time and again in the past. Who can say that those men are not with them? Then why did they save the princess? To get close to you, Sire. What? There are rumors that the Black Banner are gathering mercenaries and preparing for a rebellion. So by getting us to trust the assassins, they are trying to gain information to help them out? They shall not do that! I must protect this kingdom for the sake of my elder brother. Peace was won by destroying Beladon, but much blood was shed that day. We must protect it. Otherwise, Prince Sedulus will have died in vain. You're awake. The food in the reward we got is pretty good. Yeah. We've slept and woken up, but we're still in the dream. Morning! Good morning. -Did you sleep well? -Yes! You've got a guest. I've come with a message from His Majesty! "As reward for your work yesterday, I invite you to an exhibition of swordplay." Prepare to come with me. Yu! Haru! Thank you for coming. His Majesty is grateful for what you did to save the princess. Your powers suggest you must be accomplished swordsmen as well. Now, you will engage in a mock sword battle! We ask you to demonstrate your skills for His Majesty. What the heck? I thought this was a reward. What's going on? Go! Hurry up! They pulled a fast one on us. Well, let's focus on defending ourselves and finding a way to escape. Where can we escape to? Bring it on! What is this? What is the meaning of this? Father, what are you doing with them? Princess, don't worry. This is just an exhibition match. Disrespect against those who serve our kingdom is unforgivable. Haru! Don't think badly of me. Yu! -Are you okay? -Yeah. I guess I can use a sword. So our roles weren't Townspeople A and B, but Pretty Good Swordsmen A and B. -Maybe. -Let's do it! Hey, hey, hey! -The two of them... -Work so well together. It's as if there were two of the same person. Enough! That was superb swordsmanship. Come here, both of you. Why are you doing this, Father? -We are restraining you. -What? -You will be questioned in the castle. -But these two saved me. The power that undid the curse and the extraordinary swordsmanship... They may be Black Banner assassins who are here to take the Sire's life. We can't take that risk. A false accusation! I've had enough. This is a dream, right? All of this! Haru, let's go back to our world. Huh? How will we do that? The trigger for the jump is probably when we are in danger. -What? -We'll jump into the flames. Are you serious? We have to try. Three, two, one... Now! Could it be that they are Wayfarers? Wayfarers? We finally woke up from the dream. Oh, where's Kotona? Haru! Yu! Kotona! What? What's wrong, Haru? Nothing. Nothing at all. What? You're creeping me out. Kotona. You're both acting a little strange. It's Sunday. Why the uniforms? What about you? Did anything happen yesterday? Oh... I saw something crazy here yesterday. Something crazy? Yeah. A driver asleep at the wheel drove into a building. A car accident? TRUCK DRIVER ASLEEP AT WHEEL COLLIDES INTO BUS Some people died. These guys... Big accidents are scary. HOSPITAL Another world? Is that where you came from, sir? That's right. It's a beautiful place. Oh... The other world is connected to this one. Whoever is chosen can go back and forth. I want to go too! One of these days. But there's a harsh rule between the other world and this one. Rule? There are people whose lives are linked between the two worlds. Those whose lives are linked tend to like the same things or have similar personalities. Linked lives? The link between Astrid and Kotona is consistent with what the old man at the hospital told me when I was five. I don't really get what you're saying. Kotona, shoot! Way to go, Kotona! Kotona was alive. Of course. But you saw her stabbed and dying. We must have been dreaming then. No. I think it was real. It's just a theory, but since we saved Astrid I believe Kotona was saved. Because their lives are linked? -So what if they are? -What? I don't know who this old man is, but one thing is for certain. Kotona is running around right now, full of energy. It doesn't matter whether that world was a dream or not anymore. That's not all. The three men who were in that accident look like the healers who disappeared in front of us. You've got one heck of an imagination. Miki, it's been a long time. It's Yusuke Ninomiya. Oh, Yu? You've gotten so big! When I was in the hospital, there was an old man here, right? That old man is still here, but he's such a handful. What? He disappeared? It happens often. He's such a troublemaker. He must've gone to the other world. I see, you're getting discharged tomorrow. That's splendid. I hope you get discharged soon too, sir. I will leave to the other world soon. The other world? I'll go too! Only chosen heroes can go to the other world. Huh? If you become a hero, I'm certain you'll get to go. Really? As for other notices... Kotona Takashina will be absent from school for a while due to health reasons. Her mother called this morning. We don't know the details, but she has told us not to worry... A malignant tumor? They've gotta be kidding. My dad recommended I get tested, and they found it. But you... you were hopping around! Apparently, I only have three months to live. I overheard my mom and dad talking. That's ridiculous. That's impossible! So, you know... if you can just treat me like you always have... until I... I have to go. It's already past visiting hours. Kotona, I'll go with you. No. It's okay. Why? Why is this happening to Kotona? Haru, let's try and go back to the other world. The old man also called it another world. He said our lives are linked and that it's governed by a harsh rule. It might be because the princess is in danger again. That's why Kotona... What are you saying? Is that a joke? Haru. Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe Astrid was supposed to die, but since we saved her, Kotona's is going to die instead! Wouldn't that make it a harsh rule? That can't be! Okay, then, Yu. Let's go back to that world again. But... I'm going to kill Astrid to save Kotona! Haru, you... You can't do that! I'll do anything to save her, even kill someone! I'm sick of your fantasies! The other world, huh? Where's Yu? What is this place? What is this monster? Welcome... to our Black Castle. Who are you? My name is Galeroth. And you can travel across the two worlds. Legend says you have the power to save the world. A "Wayfarer." Wayfarer? Wayfarer Haru. Why not use that power to right this wrong? You escaped once and you still dare show your face again? My friend Kotona's life is in danger! Kotona and Astrid's lives are linked! That means the princess is in danger! What are you talking about? The princess is under strict protection of our guards and doing fine! The linked lives you speak of, do you mean the legend of another world? What are the grounds of your belief? When I undid the curse on the princess, Kotona was saved. And Bertha, she looks just like Sis Saki in our world. Seriously? You're still talking? Sis Saki... What an ill-mannered way to refer to an elder sister. Did you know the total number of lives in our worlds are predetermined? Total number of lives? That's right. If you break this rule in this world and save a life that was marked for death, a person in your world pays the price. That's right. That means Astrid, who was fated to die, needs to be killed. It's true! I came from another world! So you're saying you are definitely a Wayfarer. It doesn't matter. I just want to save Astrid and Kotona! I have a report! We just received word of a Black Banner uprising. What? Is this the danger to the princess you speak of? It may be. Please protect the princess! First, you must confess! To what? Your friend is part of the array of Black Banners. That can't be! Pay attention. You will strike down the princess of Evermore as part of the Black Banner. It is to save the one you love. Do not waver. I'm not wavering. But I still have to kill someone. I need resolve for that. You said this world is just a dream. Killing people in a dream should not be a problem. Our proud scouting unit, the Hawk's Eyes, spotted your comrade with other soldiers. Isn't your friend Haru indeed an assassin? He's not a Black Banner. He's... just tormented with worry for Kotona. Sire, Gnauss, please believe me! Very well, since you insist... you shall be the princess's guardian and join our battle lines. You will kill Haru, . who is part of the enemy. If you do that, we will acknowledge you are not an enemy. Sire, what say you? Very well. I appoint you as the princess's guardian. Listen, even if you and the enemy die at each other's swords, you will protect the princess. Yu. Astrid. I've heard from Gnauss. Because I was saved, your dear Kotona... It's not your fault, Astrid. Astrid, what are you... My mother made this dagger with magic. Protective spells hold no effect against this dagger. If the power I've inherited is used for evil, I will be forced to use this dagger. This dagger can take my life. Now kill me with this dagger! Then you will be free from your regrets. Regrets? I have no regrets! You do. By saving the life of someone from another world, you wonder if you've doomed the life of someone dear to you. My life was saved by you. For the sake of Kotona that you and Haru hold dear, I will give you my life. I could never do that. Why not? It's wrong to take someone's life in order to save another. Is it? If that person is important to you, wouldn't you want to save them no matter what crime you must commit? I would do anything to save her, even kill someone! Astrid... Have you no resolve, then? Sacrifice something in order to save someone precious? Resolve? If I were you, I would use the dagger to save the life of my beloved. Now is the time for you to decide who is truly important to you and if you will save them. Princess... please hear what I have to say. Dandy. I know about the legend of souls in this world being linked to souls in the other world. But for someone to die to save another, do you really think that is right? Exactly! I still don't know how lives are linked. I want to save both you and Kotona. No, I will save you. Please believe me. Yu... Black Banners are no match for us! We'll crush them! We're counting on you, drunkards! Leave it to us! Have plenty of drinks ready! They broke through! Retreat! This is... What's the matter? Lost your nerve? In order to protect those you love, you must take the lives of others. That is war. I know that. In that case, it's time to wage your own war. Right. How can this be? Haru is here. -I have to go. -Wait! Will you be able to fight Haru? If you go without resolve, you will lose your life. Still, I want to protect you. Yu! Your Majesty! We have trouble! They've breached the castle gate. -The castle town is a battlefield! -The enemy is 20,000 strong. At this rate, they may reach us even here! How can this be? Sire, there is no need for worry. Our forces overwhelmed even the mighty kingdom Beladon. Let us have faith in our forces. Dammit! With the enemy's momentum, they may get past our final defense. We will now go ahead and help protect the castle! Yes, ma'am! Who are you? I am the Bauer Linden of the seventh-rank regiment! Remember my dog-face! I see. Okay, Bauer. Follow me! Yes, sir! This is... That is the work of Black Banner's armor. It amplifies your power. Do you like it? What happens now? We will soon succeed in destroying the kingdom's final defense. You will storm the castle, take advantage of the chaos, and strike down Princess Astrid. Having doubts? I told you. In order to protect the ones you love... I know! I've already prepared myself! This is a dream, right? Right, Yu? Follow me! You can take the life of the one you love with your own hands. Astrid. Father, at this rate... Barton and Bertha are doing their best. Stay calm. Now is the time to use Mornstar. It may be able to put a stop to the enemy. Mornstar, the legendary sacred sword. Father! Mornstar is a treasure that has been passed down in our kingdom. The vault... It is not there. The Mornstar is gone. But I've seen it. That one is a fake. What? A fake? To assert our power over the other kingdoms, Mornstar's loss has been kept a secret. That can't be. So the existence of Mornstar was a lie. My father once used its powers to destroy Beladon. Since then, the sword disappeared from our kingdom. The sword was enraged at my father for abusing its power. Haru! The target is the princess! Strike her down by any means! We must protect the princess! We will protect her even if it costs our lives! We won't let you pass! Please move. I'm going to strike down the princess! I won't let you do that! Attack! He's so strong. In order to protect the one you love, you must take the lives of others. That is war. Haru! Yu. Haru, I won't let you go any further. What are you doing? I came to take back Kotona's life. If you kill Astrid, you may end up taking Kotona's life. Don't you get it? Since we saved someone who should have died, Kotona bears the burden of death. I'm going to do what I have to. I'm going to take the princess's life and save Kotona! You're wrong, Haru! You're the one that's wrong! Kotona means more to me than anything! Don't get in my way! If you do, I'll have to strike you too! Open your eyes, Haru! That's right, I need to wake up. If this is a dream, please let me wake up. Yu! The enemy has reached the castle front! We must protect it no matter the cost! This is... Knight Commander Bertha. She's a dangerous woman. We'll take her and kill her. Move aside, Yu! I won't! Just like you want to protect Kotona, there are things I want to protect too. Then I guess neither of us can back down! That's right! Haru, let's stop this already. Kill me. If you don't, I'm going to kill the princess. I've made my decision to protect Kotona no matter what I must do! Are you prepared to do the same? You and I have always been friends. I thought we'd always stay friends. Why are we trying to kill each other? Go! All right! Crap! Oh, no! It's huge! Let's run. Stupid! It's just a dog. Don't run. I can't do this! Me neither. Hey! Crap! Am I running away? My legs have a mind of their own. Am I gonna die? Come here, stupid dog! This way! He... You're strong. Even in a wheelchair. You may be weak, but you run fast. What? Your legs... What happened? I was in a plane crash when I was a baby. I was the only survivor. I was just a baby, so I don't remember my mom and dad. But don't pity me. I'm totally okay with it. You're all alone? The flower shop lady took me in. She's a really good person. I feel luckier than some latchkey kid with a heartless family. I guess you don't like to give up either. Hey, let's be friends! Friends? I'm Haru! I'm Yu. I guess we're like two of a kind. -In what way? -Lots of ways! It has been three hours since the fire started at the Grand Angel Hotel... Am I back? ...but it has yet to be extinguished and rescue operations are in progress. We repeat... Kotona! Kotona is sleeping. She was in pain, so they sedated her. Her condition is deteriorating. Haru... Haru, enough of this craziness! The closer you get to the princess, the worse Kotona's condition becomes. Craziness? Can't you see? The fire at the hotel and the battle at the castle resonated. What we're doing in the other world is influencing what's happening here! I don't give a damn about that! I'm going to stay here by Kotona's side! Haru, please! Let's go back to the other world and stop the fighting. Or something terrible might happen! Nothing you say will change my mind. I will kill the princess. Haru, they've planted false information in you! How would you know that? This is... Knight Commander Bertha. She's a dangerous woman. Let's take her and kill her. Let's make sure. Come with me, Haru! Are you Sis Saki? Where is your brother? My brother? Don't act ignorant. You have a brother with bad legs. Yu? What do you want with Yu? Fine, then. I will get rid of you first. Sis Saki! Who's this? Sis Saki, let's run! Get in! -What was that? -It's not human. -It's coming after us! -What? What's going on? He's an assassin from the other world. Apparently, he can turn into a spider. What the heck? That makes no sense. But why is he after Sis Saki? Bertha, who looks like Sis Saki, was taken by the enemy. She'll be killed if we don't do something. I figured this would happen to Sis Saki. This is how lives are linked. So this is how? As usual, I don't get you guys. That guy asked me if I was Sis Saki. How did he know that? What? He said that? You guys are the only ones who call me that. I don't need some freak calling me Sis Saki! What's wrong, Yu? I see, of course. -I get it. Now I understand! -Understand what? Sis Saki, turn right! Yes! -Did you see my driving skills? -Sis Saki, ahead of you! -It's Yu. -Yu! Why are you here? We're in the midst of a battle! I came here to fight. This is not the place you ought to be fighting. No, it is. What? It's you, isn't it? You're the traitor. What are you talking about? I was thinking... why did the person who tried to kill the princess use a cursed dagger? The perpetrator knew about the Royal Aegis, that Astrid couldn't be easily killed. So I figured the person who was trying to kill the princess was within the kingdom. And one more thing. The assassin who came after us knew Sis Saki was called that. How did an assassin from this world know that nickname? Don't tell me. Are you saying the assassin was sent by me? I suspect you... for one more reason. The scent. When you touched me, I noticed you smelled exactly like the black dagger. How... Meaning the sword dagger was made by you! Smell? That is ridiculous to suspect me for that reason. Magic does have its own scent! Not only that, magic leaves marks. As Magic Minister, you should know that. So what if it does? The body of the assassin who cursed me should carry the mark of the curse reflected by the Royal Aegis. If you want to prove your innocence, show us your body! -Haru! -So that's what happened. I was bothered by that guy, Galeroth's words. You said this world is a dream, right? It shouldn't matter if you kill people in a dream. Galeroth... It was as if he heard our conversations in this castle. Now it all makes sense. The invading enemy forces knew this kingdom inside and out. Bertha, are you okay? Yes. Luckily, the guards let down their guard and I was able to escape. -That means Sis Saki is safe too. -Right. Very well. You leave me no choice. Well, are you satisfied? Sire! The enemy is already near... What is the meaning of this? All the pieces are in place, I see. In that case, I will have you all die right here! You're... Magic Minister of Evermore, Gnauss Wisden. My other identity is... leader of the Black Banners, Galeroth Felgrimm! How can this be? Princess, there lies a vast and untapped magical power within you. A power I desire very much. I will take this power and start a revolution. A revolution? I was the one who should've been the true king! What? Then you're... -Become the king? -Him? But that can't be. That's right. I am your older brother Sedulus Astrum! The Crown Prince of Evermore. Prince Sedulus is deceased, you lying scoundrel! I was returned! Using alchemy, I forged a new body from the flesh and blood of demons. Are you truly Prince Sedulus? I was killed by my own father. I will never forget the tragedy. Fidelius... You, who were doted on by Father and Mother, could never understand. That's true, I will never know the depth of your suffering. However... That's right. You could never understand the despair of being abandoned by Father. Under the justification of protecting our kingdom, I was offered to the enemy kingdom of Beladon as a child. I was made a hostage. But I found slivers of happiness there. I met my beloved wife and we had a child. But Father attacked and destroyed Beladon and crushed my meager happiness. Everything was robbed from me. My honor as prince, my bond with my Father, and even my loved ones! For revenge, you went into hiding, serving the kingdom as Magic Minister? Revenge? I am not moved by such a trite emotion. Father always regretted it. What happened to Beladon had to be done, -considering the state of Evermore-- -Unacceptable! Because I was born to a weak and incompetent king, I had to bear this misery! So, I will gain absolute power and become the new king! You won't lay a finger on the princess! How dare you try to stop me? If you kill me, you will also die! Do you mean your Royal Aegis? Then I shall let someone else die doing it. Haru, are you being controlled? Stop, Haru! Now, kill the princess with your own hands! Yu! -Kotona, hold on! -Kotona! Kotona. SURGERY IN PROGRESS What was that? How useless. You tried to kill your beloved one with your own hands. It was amusing while it lasted. You... tricked Haru and made us fight. I won't forgive you for that! Princess! Astrid! Astrid is protected by the Royal Aegis. Have you forgotten? Indeed. However... what if I do this? Astrid! Yu! Dammit! Pull yourself together, Yu! No, not for me. Why would you... Hang in there, please. Yu. Yu... I won't let him get away with this! I'm sorry, Yu. Just hold on, Yu. Haru... Astrid... Oh, so you've accepted your fate? I will never forgive you! Oh? Yu, you already had it, didn't you? The resolve to protect the ones you love. Sir... Yu, my boy, it's been a long time. -What are you doing here? -Good grief, I don't know if it's my age, but I had a hard time opening the Gateway. Seems like you're at death's door. Are you afraid? I am. But... I'm more afraid of being unable to protect what's important to me. What's that? I will give this to you. Only a hero, the chosen one, is allowed to wield it. Hold on. Why me? Because you are special, of course. I've been searching... for someone to pass this down to. Boy, was it hard! A human deserving of such great power isn't always found in every era. Now, I guess I'll head back. Nurse Miki might be searching for me. See you. It's time to end this. Princess! I've got you now. Now, burn out like a flame and grant me your sublime magical power! Stop! Get out of my way, you puny bug! Do you really want me to kill you first? Then I'll start with you! Yu! Oh, you're still alive? Then let me snuff you out completely. -I will protect... -Yu! ...the things I hold dear! The people I love! What? Yu. Yu! It can't be! That's... That is the Mornstar, indeed! Why is it here? The Mornstar? So what? Once Astrid's inherited powers combine with mine, I will be invincible! He plans on taking the princess's power up in the sky. Nothing will interfere with me up here! Here it comes! Bird, lend me your strength. Yu! What? How about this? Oh, no! Looks like I've won. It's over. Where is your sword? You're mine! Yes! Yu! Astrid. Thank goodness! Have all the battles ended? Yes, since Galeroth was defeated, the enemy forces have retreated. May my elder brother rest in peace. We must take heed from this and create a world without war. Let us pray peace will now prevail in these lands. Indeed. Sire, Princess. Thank goodness you are both safe. Are you okay, Barton? I, Barton, am invincible! That you are. And you two. Thank you for saving our kingdom. You have my thanks as well. We just fought for what's important to us. I see. You two are Wayfarers after all. No. They're able to come and go between the worlds because of Galeroth's power. There it is. Yu, Haru, it's time to say goodbye. When that Gateway closes, you will no longer be able to come and go from this world to yours. Along with Galeroth's power, that magic will also be lost. Really? The two of you must hurry. Go through the Gateway and return to your own world. Astrid... Got it. Yu? I will never forget you. Astrid, I... Visitors are not allowed to stay long in this world. The legend says staying could be fatal. But... No... you can't. If you stay, you will be in danger. I wish I could be the one you laugh, cry, and fight with. I wanted to be with you forever. Astrid... Yu, there's no time left. The Gateway is closing. Let's go! Be well. -Take care. -Get along in the other world. Yeah, no more sword fights for us. We'll be going then. Come on, Yu. Goodbye, Astrid. I'm sorry, Haru, but I... Yu! Haru... this is goodbye. What? Yu, no! Yu! Yu! Yu! Yu... Haru, you're awake! I'm so glad! I'm so relieved I might fall over. I... The car fell into the river. You've been unconscious for a month. I was afraid you might never wake up again. -I'm so glad. -I see. -I'll let your mom know. -Right, thanks. Oh, and I have good news. Good news? Haru? Kotona! -What about your illness? -She had surgery. They were able to remove the tumor and said she'll be fine. The doctor called it a miracle. I see. I'm so glad for you. I'm so glad. You had me worried, Kotona. Yeah, I'm sorry, Haru. But we can get into fights again. Right. I'm so happy. Where are you, Yu? You're back, right? Let's show Yu how you've gotten better. Damn, where did he go? Yeah, where's Yu? Yu? Yu is... That's right. We have to let Yu know. Huh? Yu? Yu? Who's Yu? Everyone's memory of Yu is disappearing. I just figured it out. Who you really are, Yu. SAKI FLOWER SHOP Yu... you were me. "Those with linked lives, tend to like the same things and similar people." That's what you said, right? Come to think of it, we fell in love with the same person. "You'd better not be with another fan. You might be stabbed one day." We both fell in love with the same sour orange. Yu... you were a resident of the other world. I was in a plane crash when I was a baby. I was the only survivor. I was just a baby, so I don't remember my mom and dad. You arrived the day of the accident. It's not that you don't remember them, you never had them. Your mom and dad, that is. Not in this world. In other words, you and I shared the same lives in this world and in the other. We became friends, but we were supposed to live in separate worlds. I know now, that you... were the Wayfarer. And the reason you came to this world was probably... to save me. That is something you'd surely do. This is just a theory, like you'd often say, but I imagine, you're living in the other world with the person you love. Just like me and Kotona. Yu... I feel you closer than ever before. I don't know why... but I can feel you. Take care, Yu. You and I are two of a kind, after all.
