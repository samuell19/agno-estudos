See you later, jerk. Grow to be big. Got a problem? Goodbye. Don't touch me! You make me sick! Let me go! That's not what I want! You asshole! You piss me off. When did I ever say I'd marry you? You've got it wrong. You withdrew money? You reserved the chapel? Fuck you! That's my money! It's my savings. For me, right? That makes it mine. Are you an idiot? I just wanted to surprise you. Really? You've got it all wrong. You thought I loved you? You're such a fucking dolt. You really are slow. You're so dumb, will you be okay? Can you survive? I get it. You thought we were in love. So that's it. Okay then, let's break up. Stop it. Let me remind you. I got the bad end of the deal. I'm a victim. You'd be handed the death penalty in court. You'd surely be executed! You make me sick, I'm leaving. I'm going to my true love. Don't go. Give me taxi fare. So long. Don't go. I said don't go! Dear Jun, Sorry for not writing sooner. It's been 5 years since we started living apart. You wanted to become president and fire incompetent congressmen. Are you on your way to realizing your dream? I'll return tomorrow afternoon by train. I have to see you. I'm going on a trip. Will and Testament Do you remember my promise? When you were bullied, I promised I'd take you away from this world. Now I will fulfill my promise. I have a destination. It's far, but I plan on bicycling. In this day and age, man has to determine his own discipline, hardships and rules for himself. I'm being poseur as usual Don't worry. How I wish I could change. See you tomorrow. I quit my job at the pinball arcade. It wasn't for me. I'll move out of my apartment soon. We don't have much time, so let's depart at dawn. I trust you'll come with me. From Kiminobu I'm back. Welcome home. Well, if it isn't Kiminobu! Are you using Jun as your refuge? No, I'm just here for a change of scenery. Will you give me a hand? I'll introduce you. This is my wife. He's Kiminobu, a friend from high school. I'm Sayaka. I've got work to do. Don't be so rude. What's with him? I've got to go. What's with you? Hey, you guys! Drop by anytime. Wait! I said wait! Don't tell me, you love her. Jun. Get me a towel. - Towel! In your bag? Will and Testament Listen. Do you want to be free? Come be free with me. Free? Yes, free. The world revolves without us. We didn't choose to be born. As far as I can remember I've been inside myself. I said that to my mom once and she got really angry. What did she say? So what did she say? Nothing in particular. She was just really mad. Parents are irresponsible. They don't guarantee our happiness. What's wrong? Did something happen? I said nothing, didn't I? Nothing happened! What I say or think has nothing to do with anybody! A short, but full life. That's what I want. I'm thinking about joining a group I got to know on the Net. They call themselves, "The Circle of Life Experiment." "Life experiment?" It's a mass suicide group. They'll commit suicide together. Are you going to kill yourself? That's not the point. "I show what true freedom is." I didn't choose to be born. I'm free to end my own life. What's wrong? You want me to join you? I'm asking you. You mean, I'll die? Everyone dies sooner or later. It doesn't matter when. Are you happy? No, I'm not. Do you think you'll ever be happy? I don't think so. When you get there and you still don't want to die, you can leave. It's only a trip, right? Yes... a trip to freedom. It's in a port town in Shizuoka Pref. It's scheduled for Sept. 9th. We only have... 7 days. It's 500 km from here. We don't have much time. Is this the place? That's right. What's there? Don't know. I don't even know who'll come. Then no one might come? If this is just a joke, then I'll stay alive. Aren't you hungry? If I die, would you be sad? Did something happen? No, nothing. Don't be ridiculous. Act your age. Mass suicide The ocean. See you. - My part-time job. - I know. You scared us with your nonsense. You're seeing me off to my part-time job... for the first time. Really? Careful on your bicycle. Kumi is coming home next week. Really? Say hi for me. Won't you be home? I mean... I'll be here. See you. Bye, son. Will you give me a minute? Hey, Sayaka! You called me a nerd! You'll regret it. I'll make you regret it. I'm going to do something great. Watch me It's something you could never do. Just leave it! Hurry up! We won't see the ocean for a while. Hello, Miyamoto residence. Bread? No, thanks. Feel sick? Are you okay? I'm okay. Let's go after I drink this. Hello? I'm at my parents. You went to my apartment? When? Don't go when I'm not there. Was the door locked? I don't remember locking it. Yeah, thanks. I'll call you. Okay, bye. You brought a phone when you plan on dying? You didn't? Ouch. How far did we go? About 60 km. Is that so? But I'm exhausted. Tomorrow we'll pass through this town. Why? It's out of our way. We're meeting a comrade. Is he coming with us? Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't tell you. What? You're against him coming? That's not what I mean. I thought it was just our trip. I've already called him. Ouch, the pain. It hurts so much I can't sleep. Who's there? What's up? Nothing really... Go back to sleep. I can't, my bum hurts too much. It's beautiful. Let's go to bed. Do you like me? What's up with you? You're acting weird. Answer me, do you like me? Well, I mean... I wouldn't have asked you to come. Kimi... Promise me you'll like me forever. Alright. I'll finish this trip with you. I'm with you... to the very end. Good night. Good night. This is it. Sawada. Sawada! Sawada! Are you okay? Hey, you're not supposed to die yet! It hurts. It really hurts. My stomach hurts. You must be Kiminobu, right? I'll catch up with you later. Go on ahead. Wait. Shut up! Shut your mouth up, jerk! Don't call me a jerk! Let's stay somewhere tonight. Where? With you? The fridge is over there. Can I shower first? Go ahead. I won't be long. You use hotels often? I was brought often. By whom? Somebody you don't know. Jerk. There's no hot water. Yeah. Why didn't you say so? Why are you naked? Put something on. All my clothes are dirty. No trunks, either? They're all dirty, too. Damn it! I think I just touched it! Did you? Get out and put your dirty pants on! I've got one pair left. I'm saving them for tomorrow. Why didn't you pack more, you asshole? I was in a hurry. That's no excuse, you're not a kid. Sorry. Don't come over here. This is my side. Alright. - I'll turn off. - Wait. Leave it on. I wonder if we've caused a commotion? I doubt it. In what way? In town or newspapers. We're old enough to be on our own. They're probably calling us wimps. You think so? Your mother's probably happy for you. She's happy that her little boy has finally fled the nest. Think so? I'm positive. But she'll be sad if I die, won't she? Naturally. But just for a while. She'll forget in no time. A man who worked with me was killed in an accident. The next day, a replacement was hired. The new guy was friendlier, so everyone soon forgot about the cool dude who died. Why are you so eager to die? I told you I want to live a short, but full life. I want to make a point to the mass media that my suicide is my freedom. That's why you wrote a will. Did you read it? No way. I just saw it in your bag. Right. I loved this girl. I wanted to marry her. Marry? Can you believe it? Incredible, isn't it? But she said that she didn't want to marry me. Then what happened? Nothing. That's it. Will you marry? No. Getting married is difficult. You need mutual love. Mutual love? Two people have to be in love. So what happened to her? She left me. That's it? Yes, it's over. Sorry to hear that. I thought you were a virgin. A girl brought you to hotels, right? No, my mother's friend. Your mother's friend? An older woman? One day she asked me. She was giving me money, so I couldn't refuse. She paid you. But it was only her. I've no experience with a lover. So... so... I'm still a virgin. I wasn't born because I wanted to be. So I'm free to kill myself, aren't I? I won't be punished, will I? If you're punished, it'd be unfair. Let's go. Jun. Are you okay? You caught a cold. Because the hotel had no hot water. No, because you slept naked. You have to rest a while. I'm sorry. I was tired anyway. I needed a break. Are you mad at me? Of course not. I was just thinking. I'm going for a walk. Thank you. Do you have a fever? I've brought medicine. Thank you. What's your name? Your name? Ayano. What are you listening to? What are you listening to? I have a choir competition next week. Choir? Do you want to hear? Whirling, whirling wind Riding on whirling thoughts We are all travelers of time The days we have forgotten The days when we all were friends Thank you. You must be hungry. Have this, my leftovers from lunch. It's good. I made it myself. The sausage? I heated it up. It's well cooked. It's fun if you cut it into an octopus. What's the point? It just gets eaten. You're right. Can I read my comics here? Go ahead. Really? I'll go and get them. - Wait for me. - Sure. Telephone Club You're 234 You're in a black shirt and black skirt. You have a parasol. Your name? Mona Lisa? Are you Japanese? You are. That's good. So you'll wait for me there? Got it. Mona Lisa. Aren't we going? Where to? A hotel. I can't with a woman in mourning. I've had enough of funerals. Who died? Mind your own business. You don't know him anyway. I'm just sick and tired of death! Why "Mona Lisa"? What can I do? It's my name. You're right. You were bullied, weren't you? I can tell by your aura. What do you do? My family runs a laundry. I work part-time there. Your father's? No, my husband's. You're married? Don't I look it? Well, sort of. How about you? I'm on a trip. That's cool. You think so? You're weird. I'm also sick and tired of death. Did you know... right before a person dies, everything around them looks red? The man who died today said that before he died. He was delirious with his red surroundings. He was happy thinking he was special. I asked him why it made him so happy. He said he felt an overwhelming power and that he had come full circle as a human. When man overcomes all principles... and advances into a higher realm, in that instant, he surpasses humankind. It's the so-called “last glow... The glow when a body loses its soul. The last glow of the body which is not yet dead. That glow... is so beautiful. What are you? I'm nothing special. What of an unwanted and useless person in this world? What happens to them? Are you talking about yourself? No, a friend of mine. Most of us are like that. There are many unnecessary people. It's a lie that everybody has a right to live. It'd be simple if we were born into ranks like the feudal ages. We wouldn't experience failure. I be! you were a peasant or soldier. You probably had the same worries. In the middle of a battle, wondering, "Do I deserve to live?" Then you'd be stabbed and die. Stabbed... like this. Everybody's the same. I might be better off dead. Why don't you live as you are, cheeky and all? Everyone does. Most importantly, dying is really scary. You disappear entirely. Are you God? I made a mistake. And I'm about to make another mistake. I'm scared. I'm really scared. What are you so afraid of? There's no reason to be scared. Only humans worry. Don't die for nothing. Live. Go on living. You are not wrong at all. Forgive me, Jun! Forgive me! I have to go soon. Sorry, I fell asleep. It's the medicine. Did a guy come? The one who left? No, he didn't. We're going out to eat for the first time in a long time. See you tomorrow. Thank you. See you, Kumi. - Bye-bye. - See you. Brother? Kumi. What is it? I'm so embarrassed. Well, I needed to talk to you. Come on, not here. Why are you so dirty? Well... I don't understand you at all. Why did you come all the way to Tokyo? Actually... I wanted to see you. You know, I'll be home the day after tomorrow. Will you? Oh, that's right. I'm such an idiot. What's with you? Hello? I'm at the cafe in front of the station. Yes. But I'm meeting with somebody. You don't have to come. No, it's not like that. I don't want you to come. Please, don't. Don't come. Hello? He hung up. Who was it? It's nobody. Tell me, who was it? Please leave. Let's talk when I get home. I want to meet him. Introduce me. What's with you? You're such a pain. Hi. Who is he? I'm Kumi's elder brother. It's a pleasure to meet you. You're impressive. I was at driving school earlier. There was this really weird teacher. He kept adding "m" at the end of his sentences. I have to get going. I have to leave. Leaving already? Ask him to stay. Stay a little while longer. I have no regrets now. What do you mean? I wish... the both of you happiness. Thanks. I... I wanted to be like you. So long. See you. I'll be home in two days. Brother. I don't know how to say it, but... thanks for coming to see me. Wait! He was looking for you. You're late. What's wrong? You look so serious. Listen. I... I killed a girl. The one I wanted to marry. I killed her. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to kill her. That's why you chose suicide. That's right. I thought that was my punishment. But maybe I was wrong. I must we to make atonement. What about freedom? Weren't we searching for real freedom? Aren't you scared? Of what? Of dying. You'll die in a few days. I am scared. I am scared, but... There's nothing I can do. Why are you saying that? Because... I'm not very smart. I really believe... I'm not needed in this world. Nothing... is fun anymore. But I still want to live on. Why? I'm scared. I'm not ready to die. Jun, let's go home- Let's live together like before. Why are you saying that now? We must live no matter how hard. You're the one who said we could be free. I can't take it. How can you say that? That's not fair. Let's just go home. I... I... I want to be free. I'm scared to die, but I want to be free. I hate being dragged around and having people bad-mouth me. It's my life, I'll decide what to do. Don't tell me... you're going to go? Why do you have to die?! I don't know. I'm scared, too. Scared of dying. So please don't leave me alone. Please. I'm so scared. I don't want to run away. I don't want to run away anymore. Kimi, just say... I killed your girlfriend. You can tell them that I killed her for you. Then... Then I... can die for you. You... [Kim], thank you. I like you. I really like you. Me, too. Never forget me. Always remember me. You bet. Thank you for the sausage. It was delicious. When we're reborn, marry me. Jun Kimi. I'm lonely, Kimi. Kimi. I'm so tired. Kimi, I'm scared. Kimi. Where to? Where will we go? Nowhere. We'll just disappear. Both you and I will disappear. That's all. Hey, Jun. Listen carefully. You can still hear voices. Sept. 9th We are all alive That's why we are sad You're awake. Where am I? You are Kiminobu Shimura, aren't you? You often e-mailed me. Then... you are? I'm Yamabe, director of this kindergarten. This is Sanada. He's also a teacher. It must have been a long trip. Please rest. We're closed for the holidays. You are Shimura? Well... Yes, I am. I knew when I first saw you. I just want... to see... the ocean one more time. Of course, you can. Come back again at night. Yes, I will. I am indebted to you. Likewise. Beautiful, isn't it? The ocean is most beautiful at this hour. Were you surprised that I'm a kindergarten director? Long time ago, I told my parents that I didn't choose to be born. They got so mad at me. But now... I... Somehow... I'm so glad I was born. Now... is the first time I've felt that. Not everybody can be happy. That's very sad, don't you think? There are so many things that are harder than dying. I'm an academic. Equality exists, but so does inequality. But that is taboo. It's a field left to be untouched. If you seek it, the world will lose its balance. But no one really knows what other people feel. And everyone is different. Isn't that right? God will surely forgive you. I've made up my mind. I... I... I will end my life here. You must be God. We are free. No matter how the times change, we will never be restrained, nor threatened by anything, nor frightened of anything. Everything exists there and nothing exists there. God will never punish you. He created imperfect humans and he loved them. God will forgive us. We decide our own fate. It is not an escape. This is the freedom we have chosen.
