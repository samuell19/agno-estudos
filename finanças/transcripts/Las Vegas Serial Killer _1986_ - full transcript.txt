(horns honking) - [Radio Announcer] WQXQ has just learned that the Nevada Parole Board has approved the release of self-proclaimed serial killer Jonathan Klick from the state prison at Jean. Klick has served only six years behind bars, after claiming to have killed seven young women in a murderous five day rampage in California and Nevada. Noting that the body of only one of his alleged victims was ever found, the parole board granted Klick's release from a life sentence after two court-appointed psychiatrists said they believed his lurid claims of multiple murders were part of a misguided attempt to achieve notoriety. Klick was convicted of second degree murder in the strangulation slaying of Mary Jean Arbor, whose partially nude body was found in a waste container near his Las Vegas hotel room. In granting Klick's release, the parole board ignored impassioned pleas from the parents of Klick's other alleged victims. - Let's go to Vegas, Jack.

Marley, and real estate sales woman Dorothy Genovese were slain within days of the release from prison of confessed serial killer Jonathan Klick. Metro Homicide investigator George Harper said police are interested in questioning Klick about his whereabouts at the time of the murders, but declined to describe the paroled killer as a primary suspect in the two recent cases. - Where's the pizza?

(muffled screams) (gasping and choking) - [Radio Announcer] Now more information on the two models found slain during a photo session for a local magazine. Despite the apparent similarities and the method used by paroled serial killer Jonathan Klick, police say the prime suspects in the five murders remain the two gunmen sought in the recent murder and robbery at the safe-storage warehouse on Industrial Road. Authorities showed Klick's photograph to the warehouse manager, but he said the paroled murderer was not one of the two men who accosted him. While police have been unable to locate Klick for questioning, it is believed he stayed in the Las Vegas area following his release on parole. Meanwhile, grief-stricken photographer George Morgan added $2,000 to the secret witness program. The reward for capture of the slayers now total $7,000.
