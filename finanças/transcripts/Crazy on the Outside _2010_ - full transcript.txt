I mean, I stopped at this gas station just to pee. - And they had a gun. - This happened just now? I thought they were gonna kill me. I keep-- Sorry I'm late. - Are you all right? - I don't want to talk about it. I'm-- - I'm just so happy to see you. - Yeah, me too. It's good to be out. - Dickhead. - Where'd you learn how to do that? Carpool. All right, look. I wasn't held up, okay? I didn't stop at a gas station to pee. I just-- - I was at Cooper's soccer game. - Soccer. Well, how did he do? I mean, how did he play? They have Cooper at halfback. What he really wants to be is a winger. And then Emily Janison brought these great low-fat crunch cakes... and we all got to laughing and lost track of time, you know. Yes. I know how that is-- like, how about 3 long-ass hours Waiting outside a prison-- You're my brother. I love you, so I lied. I just want everyone to be happy. You want a Life Saver? I have a red one for you. Listen, Vik. I just want to go home, take a hot shower... do whatever I can to ease the huge amount of stress and tension that I'm feeling, okay? - Is that too much to ask? - Hey. Tic Tac? And that's not really helping, Vik. Vik! Damn, Vik. What? - Welcome home. - Is Ed gonna be here? Well, he is my husband, and it is his house. No, I mean, is-- is he all right With me staying here? Of course. Why would you even ask? Because he hates me, Vik. What did Mom always say? "Hate is for Hitler." Now come on. You are staying with us till you're back on your feet. Let's go. Grammy is busting. Is she excited I'm finally out? Well-- "Well"? "Well"? Hey, Vik. I mean, well what? Tom, we never exactly told her you were in prison. - Her heart. We were too afraid. - I know about her heart. So where have I been for 3 years? Welcome home from France! Come. - Bonjour. Tom. - Hey, Ed. I missed you. Hey, Coop. Good to see you, man. Alex? Cooper, Alex, don't you have something to say to your uncle? - What? - Bonjour. Uncle Tommy. - B-Bon-- "Bonjours." U-Uncle Tommy. - Thanks. That's really sweet. "Benvenu eh" Encino. - "Benveenu." "Eh"-- "Eh" En-Encino. - Okay. All right. C-Can we go, Mom? Hey. Hey, what's with the kids? Well, they're a little nervous, Tom. They've never been around anybody Who's actually been to France. Yes, he's so international, our Tommy. Notre Tom. He's a bon vivant, you know. - No. - Grandma's been taking French lessons from CDs. - Pour trois ans. - "For 3 years." - Tout pour cette jour. - "All for this day." She won't use headphones, so I've gotten pretty good too. Your French is very good. - Ou sont tes valises? - What? She wants to know where your bags are. Yeah, Tom. I mean, you must've brought more than that one little box back from... France. - France. - We were watching Gigi. I chose France. Her heart? I couldn't upset her. Upset someone once in a while. I'm taking your car. We're having meat loaf. 6:30. I don't wanna wait a whole lot longer for dinner. He'll be back soon. You be nice. Fine, fine. Put that back. Where the hell is he? I wanna eat. Choo-choo Eddie needs some coal in the boiler. He probably drove down to that abandoned railroad bridge where he and Christy used to go. - Has he been asking about her? - No. Hope he doesn't. You know, maybe just driving down there will make him feel better. I'm glad a lot of his favorite places haven't changed much. Well, that one has. They started using that bridge again last spring. - Hey, can I go to Justin's after dinner? - What about homework? I did all my math. I have a little science. but I can totally do it after. Alex, less bread and more meat, please. - Mom, you know I don't like-- - I know, but-- Great. Take it back home-- That's weird. Tommy has jet lag, and-- Allow me. You see, kids... many people who spend a year or more in France get very protective of their food... and they often wrap it up and take it back to their-- - Rooms. - Rooms. You eat it however or wherever you want. Nah. You know what? Why don't I just eat it right here? - You're right. What am I waitin' for? - Speaking of France. Tom... you think you'll be going back there anytime soon? - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that, statistically speaking... people who go to France and then get out of France... usually end up back in France. Are we expecting anyone? You stay. I'll go. - Good. - Hey. Tommy! Tommy! I-- I-I'm gonna go take a look at that. Excuse me for a minute. - I'll be right back. - Get the hell out of here, you pompous. 2-bit-- - As handsome as ever, Viki. - You stay away from my brother, you cockroach! - Slime mobile. You're a big man, tough guy-- - Hey! Hey, don't kick my car! Yeah. - That's what I'm talkin' about. - You let him take the rap and go to prison. How's your bald-headed little bastard husband? - Get outta here before I kick your car to pieces! - Tommy! Grandma's little project. Listen, Vik. That was Gray you were talking to out front, wasn't it? - I sprayed pine in here. Do you like it? - Viki. Viki, I can handle Gray. I don't want him around this house, and I don't want him around you. I'm out. I'm happy. I'm not gonna do anything stupid. I don't want to lose you again. You're not gonna lose me again. I promise. You're probably tired. - Good night. - Good night. - Boy, it'd be so much easier if you were here. - Christy? Yeah. I miss her. I just do. I know, honey. It was awful, and it was tragic. But this is a brand-new chapter. Listen, it probably won't come up, but you should know that while you were in France-- an artist in residence at the Louvre-- you got engaged. How nice for me. To a beautiful young Parisian named Simone... Who can't be with you because she's training... to be an astronaut With the French space program. - How nice for her. - Mom and Dad Would have loved her-- I mean, if they were alive and she was real. Good night. Line 33, downtown L.A. - Hey, kid. - Yeah? - Where's the probation department? - Down the hall. - What'd you do? - How would you feel if I asked you a question like that? Fine. I didn't do anything. Yeah, well, whose pee do they think it is? Thomas Zelda. Nice talking to you. Sorry for staring, but you're not quite what I expected... When the word "probation officer" popped up. Well, don't even go down that road... 'cause I'll grind your nuts and send them back to you in a pepper shaker. That's more like it. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, buddy. Wait for me downstairs in the cafeteria. Okay, Mom. Thomas Zelda. All right, let's see. An impressive list of juvies. a couple of grand theft autos... suspended, and then-- and then the big vacation. 36 months in the big house, interstate fraud and video piracy. Yeah. Well, I gave up fresh fruits and vegetables for 3 years... so people in China could enjoy Lars and the Real Girl. I want to get my son home, so let me cut to the chase. You do what I say, we meet once a week, keep your nose clean, and we won't have any trouble. You'll be able to eat off my nose. Go to 1222 Victory... and see Mr. Geissman. I've lined up a job for you. I don't need a job. My dad had an industrial paint business. and I want to start that up again. And I want to be a ballerina. Go. Listen. You've probably heard this a million times... but I'm not like the other guys that walk in here. I'm totally, 100% committed to turning my life around. And I know just how to do it. I have all his old contacts, and I'll start just the way he did-- by painting houses. Let me be your biggest success story. I can do this. Welcome to Pirate Burger, matey. You gotta get the whole pirate thing. Really grind the "R." All right. Yeah. We're gonna start you in the back... so let me get this vest-- Step one. Pour the frozen potatoes into the basket. But you can't-- I repeat, you cannot lower the baskets into the oil... till the green light comes on. - Then what? - That's it. He's teachin' him the fryer on the first day. You wanna give it a try? Could I? This guy's gonna get burned. - Just like you got burned. - Yep, yep. Light's not gettin' any greener. Seaman. Yeah. Drop it in the fryer... - watch the bubbles-- Here, a head of lettuce comin' at ya. Not everyone picks this up so fast. You're a Major League pitcher now? - Yeah, you throw that lettuce at me-- - You're gonna do great. Don't start. Don't-- Don't even think about it. Where the hell is he? I wanna eat. It's his first day on the job. Maybe he had to work late. Yeah, probably had some high-level meeting about the milk shake machine. I changed your sister's diapers for 11 months after the accident. Did I complain once? Cut him some slack. Okay. It's all right. We'll wait. God, I love the way that shirt pulls in the front. Line 29, Encino. Of course my sister never went to France. - What? - What? Nothing. - I think you said something. - No, just, I like those pants. - Shut up, and you won't get hurt! - Where are we going? My knee! Where are we going? Hey, let go of me! Where are we going? Keep moving and shut up. Come on! Take the thing off my head. Easy. Just take this off. I haven't got-- What-- Surprise! - Jesus, Gray! - Were you surprised? - Weren't ya? - I almost crapped my pants. Get the man some new pants. - How are ya? Ya look good. Welcome home, scumbag. - Thanks, man. - Looks like you're doin' great. - Yeah, you should see the office. Come on. These cars here, I give 'em to girls I break up with. Consolation prizes. J'ai faim. Let me guess. "I'm hungry." Here's the office. - Over the top, just like you. - It's not over the top. It's nice. What's your pleasure? You want steak, lobster, caviar-- yeah-- Cindy? That's right. - I like the hair. - Thanks. - I shouldn't be here, Gray. - I knew you were gonna say that, that's why I had to kidnap ya. - Hey, Tom. - Just relax, enjoy yourself for a few hours, okay? Besides, if you leave, I'm gonna have to kill ya. You know what? I got a few minutes. Maybe I'll take one of those sausages. I knew it. I knew it! Mitch, Mitch! I told ya. Get him a sausage, okay? And Wrap Cindy up. He'll have her for lunch tomorrow. - You've been missed, my friend. You've been really missed. - You've done real well. There's 6 billion eyeballs in China. They gotta watch somethin'. Shit. So, I'm gonna go freshen up. You wanna come? You better learn how to pick up the soap with your feet, bitch. Welcome back. I don't think so. All right. Sorry. These Chinese guys in San Francisco-- they're makin' me a mint, but they're a pain in the ass. They really are. Thanks, baby. You know, not a Sunday goes by that I'm in church lightin' candles... that I don't thank God you didn't rat me out. In other words, thank you, Tommy. A toast. I toast you, I thank you, and I want you back. I don't care what your fruitcake sister says, I'm gonna take good care of you. - Salute. - Salute. - Are you out of your mind? - Jesus, Vik. You're home one day, and you're back with those people? Come with me. - You scared the hell out of me, sitting there in the dark. - Good. - What are you so ticked off about? I'm a grown man. - Listen. It's your life. - You're darn right. - If you want to screw it up, you can. Where are we going? What are we doing? What are you gonna do, lock me in the garage? Dad's truck. His first truck. I was gonna wait till it was waxed, but... I don't think there's any time. Man, Vik. This thing looks brand-new. Don't lose sight of this, Tommy. Don't get seduced by Gray. You can take Dad's old company and make it new again. You can do it. I can't believe you did this. I don't know what to say. Thanks. Thanks for everything. I just wish Christy were here to see all this. If I could bring her back, I would, okay-- I mean, to-- so that you could have it all. Christy would Want you to do this. She would Want you to make it. - I'm sorry about tonight. - I know. New interior, new tire-- Everything's new. It looks great. Edgar, dab it. - Dab it. Don't slather. - You're an expert all of a sudden? Even an idiot knows a dab from a slather. So then why don't I just put little dollops on it? Now that's... a smear. - I hate this job. - Hey, it's better than slatherin' in prison. Ex-cons? Really? Never would've guessed. - Nice work on the Barnacle Buns, Tom. Deft touch. - Thank you, Captain. Got a little mess on the poop deck. Restroom. Lunch overboard. - Somebody barfed. I need you to swab. - Can I take your order? I'm picking up a Buccaneer Burger, Frigate Fries and a vanilla Shipshake. Aye, matey. Come on, Seaman Tom. Swab the deck. Seaman? - The poop deck is that away. It's not smelling any fresher. - Just a minute. Swabbie, when I give an order, I expect your full attention. Christy. Christy! Hey, Christy! She's not dead. She's not-- dead! The doctor says not to worry. The filling Will pass right through his system. - You told me she was dead! - Bye. - What's goin' on? - It's all right, folks. He's not a real pirate. - He's my brother. - It's okay. You told me her car exploded. Exploded! I need the room, Denise. - Well, Mr. Ballandorf is getting his-- - Denise, she needs the room! You remember my brother. Hello, Mr. Ballandorf. How are you? All right. I'm gonna tell you something, but I really need you to calm down first. - Okay. I'm calm. - First of all... I love you more than anything in the entire world. You are my brother and I never want to see you hurt. This is so hard for me. Here. I want to start by saying... I never liked Christy, and I never thought she was good enough for you. - 6 months after you went in, she dumped you. - No way. She dumped you, Tommy. She wanted to screw around. She's trash. - She wanted to tell you it was over, and I wouldn't let her. - Why not? I knew how hard it was for you in prison. I didn't want her to make it any harder. - This isn't happening. - Yeah, it is. No, it's not. - I have letters she wrote. She wrote me a lot of letters. - That was me. - Excuse me? - I did it because I love you, Tommy. - I didn't want to see you suffer anymore. - What about the sexual stuff? Yeah, that was a little icky. You're upset, aren't you? - Why did you tell me that she had died? - Well... Fritzi quit, and I started Working for Ed. The kids got serious about soccer. It was the year we put on the sunroom, remember? And the letter writing was just more than I could handle. So I killed her. Yep. Probably should turn the gas off. Sailor Tom, return the car right now... or you will walk the plank! - That means "fired." landlubber. - Cap'n. Who is it? It's me. Tommy. My God. - I just ate at Pirate Burger. - I know. I work there. It's part of a probation deal. Listen, I know you've moved on, I know you fell in love with somebody else, but-- - My God. I can't believe this is happening. - I know. My-- - I just-- I wanted-- Wanted to do is-- is say that you... - Yeah. Flat panels. L.C.D.s. high-def plasmas-- rear projection TVs-- We got the largest selection of big screens in the country. And When I say the country, I mean the county. So when it comes to gettin' the best big screen, there's no better person to see than me-- Frank Fabercini, the Big Screen Genie. In a recent national poll-- that I made up myself for the purpose of this very spot-- - Yeah. Yeah! - 97% of the people agree... size does matter. Again? Again? Again? I thought you were dead. Really? I thought I was moving pretty good. - No. Viki told me you were dead. - What? Yeah, she thought, while I was in prison, it would protect me. That is the-- You know, she never liked me. - In my head, I made a million plans for us. - Tommy-- - No. Marriage, kids, get my own paint business going. - Slow down... No, you gotta hear this. I never stopped loving you... even though my sister told me you were dead. - And I wanna start over. I know we gotta start slow. - Chris? Shit. - Who's that? - Frank. - Christy? - Who's Frank? Frank. Frank is my boyfriend. Just get in the bathroom. Get-- - Christy? Hey, babe. - Hi, baby. - Mmm. What are you doing here? - I was driving to work. I got a little horny. - I thought I'd pop by for a quick pass in the end zone. - That's... so sweet. How come you didn't answer? You know how nervous I get when you don't answer. I was just about to jump in the shower. I probably didn't hear you over the sound of the water. This building. Why don't you run, get us a cup of coffee. - I'll be with you in 5. - Okay. - Tommy, I'm confused. - You're confused? - I wanna watch! - Jesus. You know I like that. I'll be with you in just a minute. Okay. - Go, go, go. Out the window. - Wait. The window? He said he would kill any man he ever caught me with. Go! Tommy-- What is this? That... is a little surprise I got for Maui. Okay. Line 33, downtown L.A. I thought you were Mondays at 4:00. Who are you, the Rain Man? It's a movie about a freak who remembers things. Forget about it. - Did you ever kill anybody? - I'm thinking about it. You're funny. I scored the winning run. They gave me the game ball. - What's that, hockey? - Baseball. I'm really not allowed to talk to you. He didn't talk to me. I was talking to him. Inside. - If I'm not out in one hour, you call the police. - Okay. My mistake. You are the police. A day and a half and you get fired. - What the hell's wrong with you? - I screwed up. - But I have my reasons. - You guys always have reasons. First of all, I'm not "those guys," so please stop calling me "those guys." - And secondly-- - Don't tell me about those guys. I made a career out of those guys. I married one of those guys. So you're familiar with those guys. I spent the better part of the day... begging the captain of Pirate Burger to give you a second chance. - God, I really appreciate that. - I know. You want to... start up your dad's business. I mean, this isn't career day, Mr. Zelda. - Do you want to go back to prison? - No. - Do you want to go back to Pirate Burger? - No. Well, let's say those were your only 2 choices. -* Shiver me timbers and work the sail - Aye, aye. Captain * Pull on the ropes or drink the ale - What are you doing? - I'm fryin' the Frigate Fries. You fry the Frigate Fries at 350. No. The Matey Potateys are at 350 just like the Doubloon Loaf. You don't even fry the "Duh-bloon" Loaf. It's baked, nose-Wipe. That really hurts my feelings. Well, how about "bastard son of a failed pickpocket and a hooker"? So that's it for you guys? The great potato debate? Don't you guys have any dreams, I mean, something you want to do with your lives? Well, yeah, y-you know-- you know, live a nice life, no more jail... or maybe start a family, some shit like that. I really like dancing. I wanna-- You know, I'm good at it. Sailor Tom, delivery. And stay on course, Sailor. - And let's keep it under 30 knots, Sailor. - Yeah, yeah. Pick up, Christy. Pick up. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. Tommy. I need to see you. Tommy, last night was a mistake. - What are you talking about? - I'm sorry. I'm really confused right now. - And I can't talk. I've gotta go to my parents'. - Wait a minute. Christy! - Christy! - Sorry. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I live here. I know. You're Papadopolous. It says "Franklin, 413." Ethan, get out here. That's his father's last name. He did this to get you here. And that's why he asked me Where you were working. Well, it's a good thing I don't work for a car dealership. Just wait here. Ethan... get out here now. I am going to count to 5, young man. 1... 2-- - Hey, what's with the hat? - 3-- You think you could Wear this any better? Be my guest. 4-- - Yeah. That's workin'. - Do you remember what the word "consequences" means? I do. You came in. Yeah. I need you to cover this. What-- What do I owe you? Tell you what. The Mutiny on the Brownie-- that'll be my treat. Let's say, 13 even. This is coming out of your allowance. Why? I've... gotta eat. Ethan, where-- Where did he get the hat? Boy, I didn't-- How did he get that? Sorry for the trouble. It's no trouble. There's enough for all of us. Finish packing. I don't want to go to the stinky desert for the weekend. - Grandma smells like corn. - So does mine. - All right, would you not help? - Well, I'm just sayin'. Pack. I'll see you Monday. Right. You know, this apartment sure could use a paint job. Well, I'll speak to my decorator. - Can my room be blue? - Pack. I'm just sayin', if my painting business was up and running... - Yeah. - Good night, Mr. Zelda. See you Monday. Hold on a second. just... don't take this the wrong way, because you seem like an okay guy. Yeah. I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't encourage my son. He's looking for something, and I-I don't want him to find it in you. See you Monday. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Thank you. I'll get it. Hey, there. I'm here to see Christy. My God. This is brilliant. - What's with the party? - Engagement party. They didn't tell you? - No. - Hey, she is gonna love this. Christy, your pirate's here. My God. Do you need music, or do you have your own? Who knew that they came in fuchsia? You said "boyfriend." You never said "fianc?." I didn't want to hurt you. I wish somebody would hurt me, somebody'd tell me the damn truth! - I'm sorry. - You can't marry this guy. What about us? "Us" Was a long time ago. - "Us" Was last night. - Okay, it just kind of came out of nowhere. My head Was spinning, and-- I love Frank. - Who the hell is Frank? - Frank Fabercini. The Big Screen Genie? He's a great guy. He's a-- - He's a little insecure at times, but he loves me. - I love you. I love you. I guess a part of me is always gonna love you. But, Tommy, you were in jail for 3 years. 3 year-- Look at this. Look at this. While you were away, Frank was-- was building a business, and he's gonna be... the number 4 Mitsubishi salesman in the North Valley. I got a paint business. It could be the biggest one on the planet. That's not the point. - You're marrying for money. - For stability. For the future, I-- I wanna have a child. This is so hard. If things were different... I would probably be marrying you. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta get back inside. Just wait a second, Wait a second, wait a second. I just need a chance to get my life back on track. I can be the guy you need. I think I already have the guy I need. Tommy, wait... Wait a minute. I want you to promise me something. Promise me that if you ever-- and I mean ever-- need a TV, DVD or any other high-end electronics, that you will call us. You can't beat that anywhere. That means you will be watching your brand-spanking-new TV that very night. "What? That same night?" That's right! Because when you buy from Frank... - I will personally deliver your new big screen-- - I'm not giving up. I spent too much time thinking about Christy to walk away now. - You think I'm insane for being so hung up on her, don't you? - No, I think you're a romantic... and you're holding on to a dream, even though the reality is... that Christy is a cheap slut, and you deserve better. Here. You have the last cookie. Okay. That was a little blunt. I just don't understand What you're doing with her. You should be With somebody nice. She just wants someone to provide for her. There's nothing wrong with that. I just need some time to get my game on, you know? Just feel like I'm playing catch-up. - Ketchup? - It's 2 words: "catch-up." So there's no chance of her comin' back early. Nah, she's in the desert till Sunday. I almost got this. Almost got this. Almost-- What? He wonders why your breath smells like a donkey. Got it. So my youth wasn't entirely wasted. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, boy. Boy, boy. Okay. - These walls are gonna need a lot of prep. - Yeah, they are. All right. 2 coats of flat on the walls. Let's do gloss on all the trim. - We got some work to do, guys. Let's get at it. Come on. - What the hell? Come on. Careful with the little pottery pieces. Watch out. Okay. You guys, get-- careful with those candlesticks. Candlesticks? I didn't see any candlesticks. - Hey, you know how to use this stuff? - Yeah. I'm going down to get primer. - Don't mind me if I watch for a minute. - You can watch. Good. Very good. You spilled the paint? You look like y-you need a little activator. Put it back. Put it back. Thanks for makin' us a part of this, Tommy. Hey, you guys did me the favor, and I won't forget this. Beats bein' a freakin' pirate. I'm gonna pay you back for this someday, Tom-- somethin' big. Like what? How the hell should I know? Just thought of it. My God. We've been painted. You wanna know a secret? Sure. I lost my virginity in this truck. My God. That is so weird. So did I. It gets weirder. So did Mom. Say, it does get weirder. - Angela. - What the hell were you thinking? Are you out of your mind? I just wanted you to know how good I was. At what? I mean, breaking and entering-- - I could have you arrested. - I love my blue room. All right. Just go back to the car. And if you do this again, I will have you arrested. Your probation officer. - Yeah. - You broke into her apartment. Yeah. Bold. Hey! Come on. Get in. I think he means me. Tommy, you drive. You like this car? Yeah. This is beautiful. - Come on. Take it. Don't be afraid. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. If you see a cop, just floor it. We'll be in Mexico before he can flip on the siren. This isn't a golf cart. Drive it. I'm on probation. Forgive me if I'm a little nervous about doing 125 in a 25. God, this thing's nice. Good mileage too, right? - You love doing that, don't ya? - Yeah. - You love this car too. - I love this car. - You want it? - Don't do this to me, Gray. Tommy, I want you back. I need you to come back. I need someone I can trust to take this thing to the next level. - I just got out of prison. - And how's that goin' for you? You having any fun? Any money? Big future? Well, nobody ever went to prison painting a house. You're not gonna go away. It's not cans and film and videotape anymore, Tommy. We stream the master to China broadband. All right? Nobody here even gets their hands dirty. Tommy, it could have been me who went away. It was you. All right? I owe you. Let me-- Let me give you this. The take's 12 million. Half of it's yours. 6 for you, 6 for me. You gotta do me a favor. You gotta stop asking. - Sorry I'm late. - Hey. Are you seeing another ex-con? I mean, is it over between us? I stopped home to check on Ethan. He was up all night with an earache. Is the kid okay? Not that I'm taking any special interest in your kid or his ear. No, the-- the kid is fine. - Thank you. - Good. We really do have to move this along. I'm late for the office. I mean, it's my job to scrape onion debris out of the fryer. I really wanna knock their socks off. Well, this will just take a second. What you did yesterday Was incredibly stupid. - In retrospect, perhaps. - I mean, you really pissed me off. But I do know what you were trying to do. Doesn't make it any less stupid, just more understandable. You're a really good painter. Thank you. What changed? What do you mean? Why the change of heart? I don't know. A little-- A little voice just kept saying over and over, "Don't be so mad. Don't be so mad." - The kid. - Yep. I spoke to a judge I know who does a lot of work with ex-cons. He said he needed some painting done, and I told him about you. Call him. - Remember, nothing changes. - Nah, I-- But-- No, you keep the day job and paint in your spare time. I don't know what to say. Say you won't screw it up. I won't screw it up. I won't screw it up. Hi. It's Christy. You know what to do. Christy, it's Tommy. You know I never give up. Got my first painting gig. You're engaged, but you're not married yet. This may sound crazy, but we're gonna work this out somehow. You know why? You know why, babe? Because I want you. You hear that? I want you. Hey, Tommy, you look pretty chipper cleaning that fryer. Well, that's 'cause I got us another paintin' gig. Feels like there's a dead body in here. You'd know. My goodness. Look at her. Tommy, come check this out. Man. I would love to bang her. I'd bang her till she forgot her name. Her name is Christy. - That's Christy? - Perhaps we were a bit indelicate. I figured this whole thing out, and I am so thrilled, I had to come down. Okay. I have to marry Frank. I just do. I-I'm in it too far, and there's a band. We're going to Maui. And I love him. But I love you too. So, here's what we're gonna do. It's a little different, but it's the only way. I am gonna marry Frank. But you and I are gonna see each other Whenever we can. - What? - Hear me out. He travels and he works late. He's in the Army Reserve. I know. It's wrong. We're all Catholic. But I think in the end, we're all gonna get what we want. - I don't wanna do that. - Come on, honey. Think about it. It grows on you. God, I wanna make love to you right now. I really wanna make love to you. But unfortunately I have to go taste Wedding cakes with Frank. Love you. Can I take your order, please? - Screw her. - Screw Frank "Frabocini," too, while we're at it. I mean, has she lost her mind? Who-- Who goes into a marriage planning on cheating? - What woman anyway? - You know what you tell her? You tell her, "Dump Frank or forget it." De-e-livery. Tommy. That is one saucy wench you've got. Shiver me timbers. What am I doin'? She's got the rich guy now and a big fat diamond. If I were smart-- If I were smart, I'd just walk away. You know what? I don't care what he says. He's still not over her. I really wanna do something for that guy. Something big. What the hell you gonna do? How should I know? I'm just-- It's a gesture. Poor guy. She's turning his whole life upside down. Do you think... she'd do me on the side? Good. The convicts are here. * Brown-chickee brown cow I should have been a judge. Well, you stood up in front of enough of 'em. Listen, guys. Let's go in, check out the situation... be courteous and act like professionals. There's a magazine just about hotels. How's it going, guys? - Hey, good. - Beautiful house, sir. Yeah. Beautiful house. If I gotta take a dump, I'm taking it home with me. Is that right? We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so. Edgar. Cover it and let's move on. - Man, I am hungry. - Yeah. We keep moving at this pace, We'll be out of here by early afternoon. Perfect. - My God. - What? A rat? No. My sister. Look what she made. Zelda and Son Painting. Thomas Zelda. That's nice, Tommy. - That's-- - God, she make one with our names on it? Probably in tomorrow's lunch. - Which one of you is Tommy? - Right here. Thank you. Hey, there. Nice work. What are you, checking up on me? A little. Ethan had a game just nearby... and I thought it might not be a bad idea to come by and see how it was going. - Well, it's actually going really, really good. - Terrific. It's great to hear. Where's the judge? In small pieces in the basement. I'm afraid We had a little tiff over the price, and I overreacted. - Hey, there. What's happenin'? - Hit a triple. Must be pretty exciting for a basketball player. I mean, triples and all that. If you actually went to a baseball game, maybe you could learn something. Yeah, don't get asked that much but, thanks. You know, busy guy. Honey, can you give us a second? - Mom. - 1, 2-- - 3, 4. - That's really quite impressive. Just out of curiosity, What happens when you get to 5? Well, you do not wanna know. Well, I'm-- I was not encouraging him just now. I just wanted to say hello. No, I know. I know, and I-- I appreciate it. I do my best to be unappealing, but, man, it's a losing battle. Hey. Do you wanna come to his game tomorrow? I don't wanna do anything to encourage him. No, I-I'm saying it's okay. I just-- - Do you wanna come to the baseball game? - You said-- No, I'm just-- Just answer me. - I will answer you. I just wanna know-- - Yeah, 1, 2-- - Yeah. Yes. That would be nice. Thank you for asking. - See? - Okay. - Okay. - Get back to work. - Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I could do that. So, the-- the idea... - is to catch it. - Yeah. Good job! - Go, go, go! - You're out! That's a double play. That's a double play! The kid's good. Look, he's showing off. He's not like that when it's just me. But-- - Play ball. - Go, Bulldogs! - Nice. - Nice. - How long has it just been you? - Mmm. - Would it be okay if we just kept it about baseball? - Sure. Bulldogs! You know, it's-- it's always been just me. Ethan's dad left 9 years ago, so since then it's always been just me. No. Correction. The night Ethan Was conceived, it was the 2 of us. But since then it's been just me. You meet him at work? Baseball, right. I'm not much of a team-sport guy myself. I tried drag racing. Mostly other people's cars. - Yeah, I'm okay. - Play ball! Well. Ethan's father was... an incredibly sexy... and incredibly charming con man. He called me his angel. - Hey. - Sorry. Just-- No. Well, he said it so many times, I believed him. And then one day he emptied my bank account and took my car and disappeared. So-- I mean, I-I had this fantasy that I could save him. What an idiot. - I don't think you're an idiot for caring about someone. - No, I meant him. I had this whole picture, but none of it was true. It's just amazing What we can talk ourselves into. Come on, guys. Let's get a run! Strike one. Go, Ethan! Focus. Good job! Go, Bulldogs. Am I loud? - Yeah. - Yeah. Sorry. - Hey. - Hey! Hey. That was great today, kid. - I'm beginning to like this football. - Baseball. - Thanks for coming. - Hey, it was a lot of fun. - It was a lot of fun. Thanks for asking me. - Yeah. Great. - I guess I'll see you Monday? - Yes. Wait a minute. Back at the game when I was talking about myself... I don't usually do personal real well. - I haven't done it at all in a long time. - Listen. - And-- - You don't owe me an explanation. - Let's just keep this about baseball. - No, I wanna say something. This-- This job makes you tough, it makes you put up a lot of brick walls... and, well, it felt good to be a little less tough today. So, thank you. Thank you. Hey. How was your day? Great. What are you doing sitting out here? Just relaxing. It was nice of her to ask you. - Yes, it was. - I like that Angela. I know you do. Don't go in. Sit next to me. You want a beer? - Yeah, let me go pee first. - Pee in the azaleas. The kids do. I think Grandma does too. And then come sit down. Stay out here with me. It's such a beautiful day. - Little brother. - All right. Okay. All right. I'm just gonna-- Is there some reason you don't want me going into the house? Don't be ridiculous. Why wouldn't I want you to go in the house? She's up. She wants you. She's not the only one. - Oops. - What's going on? Viki! - I'll be right there. - Viki! - What's going on? - Nothing. She's fine. She fainted. - She fainted. - Yeah. Apparently she got some upsetting news. - Vik? - When I got home, she was on the phone with Air France. She was gonna take us all to Paris to see Simone's launch. Your fianc?e. The French astronaut. - Vik, I know who the heck Simone is! - Hey, hey, come on. God, Tommy. She was reading out the last 3 digits of her MasterCard. I had to stop her. I told her there Was a practice launch today... - and the whole rocket blew up. - Bad fuel mix, faulty wiring. Simone didn't make it. What are you guys, on crack? She didn't make it? - Yeah. - She didn't exist! Grammy. Grammy, it's me. Are you okay? Guys, let me handle this for a minute here. Hey, I heard you fainted. Are you okay? My poor Tommy. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna be okay. Such a tragedy. Such a waste. Will you bring the body here? Is there a body? Je suis tres triste. What are you saying? What's she saying? "I am very sad." Mon c?ur. Mon c?ur. La douleur. Her heart. Her heart. The pain. Christ, boy! Didn't you pick up any French? Beautiful! - Fuck! - I beg your pardon? - Edgar? - I'm sorry about the language, ma'am... but you scared the shit right out of my ass. Mrs. Pierce, we're just about finished. - You guys have done a really great job. - I appreciate that. - We all appreciate that. - How would you feel about doing the upstairs? - I think we'd feel fine about that. - Well, great. - We'll finish up in here, and I'll give you an estimate. - Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Hey, Angela. It's me, Tommy. Did I catch you at a bad time? No. Hi. No, we're just on our way to a birthday party. - I don't even like that kid! - What's up? Great news. Mrs. Pierce asked us to paint the upstairs. That is great. Well, I just wanted you to be the first to know. Bye. Hey, fellas! Hey. Not bad. She just wants a color change. Gotta prep these walls. I'll run down and get some primer. Hey, Tommy, thanks for making us a part of this. A couple of mutts like us with real jobs. Sure beats workin' at the prison paint shop. - Hey, you're welcome, man. - Yeah, I'm never gonna forget this, Tommy. Some day I'm gonna do something to pay you back. Something big. Thanks, Edgar. You can start by moving the dresser. I'll be right back. - Come on. - What do you mean, "Come on"? I'm comin'. - So what's this big thing? - What big thing? - This big thing you're gonna do for Tommy. - How the hell should I know? - Would you get off my back already? - I mean, what are you gonna do? You gonna show him how nice you can dance? You gonna dance for him, Edgar? Hey, you know something? Why do you got a problem with every frickin' thing I do? Friggin'? Frickin'. Yeah. Frickin'. Damn. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I wa-- I was driving home and I knew what time you got off. And I'm not stalking you or anything. So, anyway, I just timed it out and I guess-- Okay, I guess I am stalking you. You wanna come in? No. Ethan's-- I can't. Ethan's asleep in the car. Yeah, yeah. Just crack the window and lock the door. No. I-I just came to say something... - and I wanted to say it in person. - All right. So, here we are in person, and here it is. You are different. I don't know how much different, but you are. No, you are. And I know he likes you, and-and-- and that's very important... but he's never been burned romantically by someone like you. I mean-- I don't mean to call you-- I'm sorry. No, no, I don't mean to call you "someone like you"... because you're nothing like something like someone like you. And I-I don't even know if "romantic" is the-- I'm not even sure that "romantic" is the right word. And, right now I'm not even sure that-- I don't even know What the hell I'm doing here. I'm-- I wish that cleared things up. I'm still-- Do you-- Do you-- Do you wanna come over for dinner tomorrow night? - Are-Are you sure you wanna do this? - No. - I'll be there at 8:00. - Great. - Okay. - Great. - I can't work tonight. - And Why not? Because I have a date. Dear, would you get me that nice syrup I like in my coffee... that makes it taste so good? Thank you, dear. So good on a cold evening. - It's August. - All right, fine. This helps. It just does. I'm upset about Simone and What it's done to Tommy. A senseless tragedy. 2 shattered lives. Yeah. Love is easy When you're this pretty. How do I look? You're going out? Grief counselor, Grammy. He's going to see his grief counselor. For my grief. * There's a kind of hush * All over the world tonight * All over the world * You can hear the sounds of lovers in love * You know what I mean * Just the two of us * And nobody else in sight You son of a bitch! I go out on a limb for you, and this is how you pay me back? Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you talking about? - Don't bullshit me. Where's the ring? - What ring? Judge Pierce just called. His wife's diamond ring is gone. So, give it back. I didn't take it. Brilliant. Just brilliant. Believe me, this had nothing to do with me. All right, just get it back, Tommy, tonight, or the judge will call the police. I bought you a couple of hours. God knows why. This has nothing to do with me. I didn't do this. I am such an idiot! Cancel all orders for the Octo-pounder with cheese. No more. None. Thank God you're here. Your two friends are gone. - What? - They abandoned ship. Grab your uniform. - Figures. - Wait! Welcome to Pirate Burger. May I take your order? - Yeah. Frigate Fries. - Wonderful choice. Hey. Hey, Rick. Hey, Tommy. It's Tommy. Hey, Tommy, we've been waiting for your phone call.

What the hell is going on? I am sorry, honey. It's complicated. I can explain. My God. Look at the size of that thing. Is that him? I didn't hear anything. He's here? He's here? This asshole's here? Is that what you're telling me? - Son of a-- Son of a bitch! - Christy. Christy. - I've gotta get that ring back. - Hey! Hey! All right, stop, stop, stop. Don't. No, no, don't. - I-- I love him. - What? - Well, I love both of you. - Yeah, but, I don't love you. Well, in that case maybe I just love Frank. - That's it. You come-- - No, stop... - What about the ring? - It was stolen. I don't care. It was magnificent. - Enough. Come here. - No, no. Listen. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. - I wasn't gonna hit you. - To be honest, Frank, there's no way I could have known that. That's a good point. Ice. - Get him some ice. Here, right here. - Thanks. Or a bag of frozen vegetables are even better. Try to breathe through it. Breathe through it. Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe. Look, put the peas on his nuts. - Okay, I'm so confused. - No, you're not confused. You love this guy. I'm just a complication from your past. Frank, you have nothing to worry about with me. I'm gonna get out of your lives. Because Christy, she's crazy about you. Christy? It's true. It's true, Frank. I do love you and only you. I know that now. - Baby. - Listen, guys. I hate to interrupt, but I gotta go. Tommy? What about the weekend thing? I don't think so, but thanks anyway. Angela. Angela. I got it back. All right. I'll call the judge. Good night, Tommy. Hey. Wait a minute. - No, please. It's been a long day. - Angela. This had nothing to do with me. You gotta know that. Okay. It wasn't you. I've gotta go. Wait a second. I hired those 2 idiots. That's my fault. That's it. - Hey. - All right, Ethan, get back in bed. Now! Okay. I screwed up. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I just want things to be Whatever we were gonna be. I can't. I thought I could. I wanted to. But I can't. - Why not? - I can't get even a little bit close to someone like you. I mean, the ring, those guys. There'll always be trouble in your life, and I don't need anymore. - I-I just have enough of my own. - This isn't right, Angela. Please, Tommy. If you care about us, leave us alone. I thought when somebody says they're sorry, you're supposed to forgive them. - Well, this is different. - How? He said he was sorry. He's not coming around anymore, is he? You know how I'm always busting your chops about your dumb ideas... and all the big things you wanna do for Tommy? Yeah. Yeah, it really hurts sometimes. Well, this time you were right. Jacking that ring was the most thoughtful thing you've ever done. You see, I just want people to be happy. Well, he and Christy are gonna be real happy. - You think they're gonna invite us to the wedding? - Without question. We'll be the best man. I'm telling you, Edgar. What you did for Tommy... is gonna turn everything around for him. Pull the vehicle to the side of the road. I was bringing it back. Who would steal this piece of shit? Hello? Hello? Hey, I think I might need a little help. Zelda. Let's get outta here. What am I supposed to tell my probation officer? I am so screwed. - You won't tell her anything. It never happened. - Yeah? No record. No paper. No trace. The desk sergeant owes me. - For real? - For real. Aren't you the man. Thanks. I mean it. Thanks. And I'm back in. Really? Yeah, I'm back in. Tommy. Tommy, as soon as I can set it up, We gotta go to San Francisco. I need you to meet my Chinese guys, 'cause pretty soon they're gonna be your Chinese guys. Here. - Jesus, Gray. - That's a signing bonus. Later. I'm glad you're back. What the hell was he doing here? - Where were you? - I gotta get some sleep. What were you doing With him? Listen, I had a real shitty night, and I just wanna go to bed. You're working for him, aren't you? Stupid asshole. You're gonna end up back in jail. Thanks for the opinion, but I know what I'm doin'. If you're with him, I don't want you back in this house. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ethan Papadopolous. - Hello. - Is Tommy home? No, Tommy's not home. Will he be home soon? I don't know. I don't think so. Does your mom know you rode all the way over here? No. Please don't tell her. I just wanted to talk to Tommy. Okay. I'll tell him you came by. Are you gonna be able to get home before dark? Yeah. We'll make the trip a couple times together... and then once the Chinamen get to know you, you'll make the trip by yourself. Who you callin'? - My sister. - Your sister? Come on. You're such a goon. You know what I'm wearing. I have to take this. Tommy? Where are you? Hey. Viki. I just wanted to call you. and I want you to know that I'm okay. - Come home. - I can't come home right now. I'm leaving town for a couple of days on business. I'll call you when I get back. You can't leave town. You'll break probation. Don't do this. - I know what I'm doing, all right? Just-- - Tail number? - 484 Tango Lima. - Welcome to Santa Monica Airport. Tommy, what are you doing With this guy? - Hey, Vik. As soon as I get back, I'm gonna-- - Hey, sis, it's Gray here. How you doin'? How's your bald-headed little bastard husband? - What's the matter with you? - Come on. What's the matter? Come on! Tommy, once we get on the plane, they-- they give me a pilot's hat. No, no, no, don't laugh. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. It just makes me feel good. No, I'm just foolin' With ya. If I wanted a pilot's hat, they'd give me one. You know that, don't ya? Tommy! Christ. Hey, Vik, you gotta go back home. Ethan's missing! - Since when? - Who the heck is Ethan? Angela called right after you did. He didn't come home last night. I-I gotta go. I gotta go. - What? - I gotta go find that kid. Tommy, get on the plane. Come on! He came by the house yesterday looking for you. Tommy, I'm not messing around. Get on the plane, or else you're done. - Don't go with him. Listen to me. - Tommy, I'm not messing around. - Look for him on milk cartons. - Hey, hey! Hey! - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Come on. - I'm all right. - Come on. Let's go. - Yeah. Excuse me. Hey, Angela. Angela, look. I know you don't Want me here, but I'm just here to help. - What can I do to help find him? - Hey. Help you find the kid. You found him. Well, I was worried. I was really worried. - Where'd you go last night? - Sizzler. - You ran away to a buffet? - Wait, nobody ran away. - He didn't run away and just come back? - No. - Didn't you call my sister and say he ran away? - No. - I was held up. - You got engaged. - If I could bring her back, I would. - She dumped you, Tommy. - Simone didn't make it. - Letter writing was just more than I could handle. - So I killed her. - Ethan's missing! My sister. My sister-- should be hospitalized. Viki told me Ethan had run away so that I would come back here. Why? Why? Maybe she eats too much bran. Well, because she's insane. And she probably should be locked up. I was worried. I'm glad you're safe. And I should go. I'm sorry to bother you. Thank you. Subtitles: Arigon If we hurry I can make Cooper's soccer game. - I knew you wouldn't go with Gray. - Yeah? You wanna know how I knew? 'Cause you're a good guy. - I hate you. - It'll pass. I have to go back up there. You knew that too, didn't you? See if they wanna come for meat loaf. Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Listen. I know you're scared. Angela. And-- I'm not the guy that went into prison. I'm the man that came out. There's-- A bad man doesn't go to a Little League baseball game... or feel the way I felt when I thought something was wrong here. There's nothing bad about how I feel about you. Well, you're a good man, Tom. But maybe that's what I'm afraid of. Hey, Viki, we're here. Everyone, Ethan and Angela. Hi. I'm Viki. So glad you're here. - Me too. - Come in. Come in.
