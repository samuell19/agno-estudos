('STARTING OVER' BY RICKY VALADEZ PLAYS) (MUSIC SOARS, INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) MARY-JANE: For someone to be able to speak English in Australia, I think it's the key to being able to be part of society. If you can't communicate, you feel isolated, you feel lonely, you're not connected. Language is the ability to be able to communicate with each other and to make connections. MA'SUMA: When we communicate, we express what's in our heart. We can tell a story, tell where we came from, tell them what we want in this world. But when you can't communicate with someone, when you can't tell them what's in your heart, that's like building a barrier between you and others, like building a wall around you. AHDIA: It's crucial for children to be able to speak fluently and be able to express themselves. Because, if you don't, you'll be like that little bird in a cage - you won't be able to fly. You have wings, but you are restricted. JENNY: The percentage of our students that come from non-English-speaking backgrounds is extremely high. Generally, the students that we get here have come because there's been conflict and trauma in their homeland. Sleeping in your bed, thinking... oh, any minute, something's going to land on your house. We're basically just trapped in this one area that's just full of our people. We cannot go outside the area. Otherwise you'll get killed. We had to escape, otherwise we wouldn't be alive today. KEVIN: You really don't have a lot of choice, you have to flee, and some of the stories where people have fled their home countries are just tragic. MARY-JANE: Some of them have come from really traumatised backgrounds. They're not trusting of people immediately. So, to win them like that is the first battle. If you understand where they're coming from culturally and the experiences they've had, you have a really good opportunity to build a safe and good relationship with the students, that, actually, then the barriers just break down. MARY-JANE: If you feel uncomfortable, if you don't feel safe, if you feel nervous or anxious, you're not going to be the best version of yourself, no. The whole process of settling in and feeling comfortable in their learning environment begins immediately on arrival. And we let them feel, make sure that they feel, that they're part of us now. It was a privilege for us to study here because they make sure that you feel home. All the support that we had, not just myself, my family, we felt more like home, we settled in much more easier. And if it wasn't for them, I don't know what we would've done when we came here. For us to actually have a program that accelerates their language acquisition is just crucial, because they can't access the mainstream curriculum until their English is at a high enough level for them to comprehend what's going on. Everything that we do for them here lays the foundation for their future learning. And if we can do it right, then we're one step closer to ensuring that they have a better life. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) ('NEW BEGINNINGS' BY PAPER PLANES PLAYS) KEVIN: Without language, people can't participate in the society. So it's just absolutely critical. It is the main need. And, beyond that, children need to be able to engage in the Victorian Curriculum, and that's in English. So we have to be able to teach students to be able to speak English, understand English, listen to English and write in English so they can participate in all of the structures that are part of the transactions of a society. I've been here for a very long time, and there's always been an EAL Program. And, originally, it was through the Education Department sending out an EAL teacher going by the data. So, we ran just a normal EAL Program, always been withdrawal, and that may not be the model in many schools. KEVIN: We've decided over time, on the basis of evidence, that a withdrawal program is the best way to achieve the outcomes that we need to achieve. JENNY: So, we've had to always bring our students out because they've come with no English generally. So, it didn't work for us to have EAL operating in the classroom. That was when I started thinking, "Maybe there's a better way to structure this program. "Maybe we do need to have our program in stages." As the years have passed, it has become a bigger consideration that we've had to cater for because our school is almost an EAL school. KEVIN: We build on that. We saw the potential for success and the growth in children. Like all the programs that we do, if something's working, we put more money and more resources into it. And that's why it's grown to the stage it has now. And it's been driven by Jenny Mackay, in the first instance, who headhunted some fantastic teachers along the way. Everybody, please take six cards. Don't look at them, just take them from the top. Off you go. And then pass it on to the next person. So the EAL Program at Dandenong North is a three... we call it a three-tiered program. We have our New Arrivals Program that caters for children who have been in the country for less than 12 months. And then we have a Transition Program for children who have been in the country for more than 12 months but are leading into the mainstream classroom, so they're still not quite ready to access mainstream curriculum. So, that's our second phase. And then our third phase, we just call it EAL, and it's catering for students who were either born in Australia or have been in Australia, say, for more than three or four years. So it's targeted to meet the needs of children at each specific level. And we identify their learning needs quite quickly because of the way that the program is structured. KEVIN: It's much more than just language-based program. To build on hope and purpose are important elements of that program. And to make people know that they are part of a big family when they've left their families behind is also very important too. JENNY: It's a program that we've had to develop over a long period of time as our cohort of students has changed. Over time, we've had students from the former Yugoslavia. Greeks, Italians, Lebanese. And, I think when I arrived, it was moving into... ..there were Turkish students, still some Greek students coming through, Romanians, the Romanians started to come out. We have currently lots of children who are coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan because of the unrest that's happening there. We also get students from Iraq, Syria. Also getting students from Sri Lanka as well. The area of Dandenong has always been an area where new arrivals will settle. ROSEMARY: So, we get a range of students - those who are refugees and have had limited schooling, and we also get students who have had age-equivalent schooling in their home country because their parents have chosen to resettle in Australia. So there's really two types that we cater for. There you are, my lovelies. Thank you. Thank you. You're very welcome. Feraz. Thank you! Most schools only have one stage - just EAL in general if they have any EAL students. Sometimes they might not even have a program at all and the student will just be in the classroom full-time. However, obviously at Dandenong North Primary School we do have that three-tiered approach. And that really allows us to cater for each stage, making sure that they are getting what they need and that they feel more comfortable by the end of the program to be in the classroom. Can somebody put up their hands and tell me a conjunction? Do we remember what a 'conjunction' is? (HUSHED CHATTER) Conjunction. A joining word? (GASPS) Love you! Good girl! A joining word! Did you use a joining word in your speaking? STUDENTS: Yes. My role in the EAL Program is the New Arrivals teacher. So I teach the students who have just come from another country and they don't know how to speak English. So I'm their first port of call in the education system in Australia. So, I get to help them learn how to adjust being in a classroom. Some students have never been in a class before because of their backgrounds. So, I get the pleasure of helping them learn classroom routines, classroom language, as well as learning how to speak, listen, read and write. 'Because'! 'But'. 'But'. Excellent. 'And'. 'And'! Fantastic. 'So'. 'So'! Beautiful. Daily routine starts with listening and speaking about common topics, so the weather, the date, seasons, colours, shapes, animals, food they like, just to get them comfortable and talking to each other. Also talking about what they already know so then they already get that little safety before we start delving into things that they may not know so well. BOY: A noun is a name of person, place, thing, animals. Beautiful! Guys, everyone, so good! We help them generate meaningful sentences by giving them worked examples, which is one of the hits, and giving them sentence starters to initially know what a meaningful sentence would look like. STUDENTS: (READ) "The other fish." Fish. Fish! How do you spell fish? F-I-S-H. ROSEMARY: In the New Arrivals Program, they might be working on writing a very simple recount. So, then when they move on from New Arrivals Program into my program, Transition, I'm aware of what the New Arrivals teacher has previously... ..the foundation that's been laid with those children, the learning that's happened. And so then I build on the learnings from the New Arrivals Program and target the needs specifically. Abby, put it in a sentence for me. Long... Fabio is good at running long-distance. "Fabio is good at running long DISTANCES." KAYLA: So, in the Transition stage, we focus on speaking and listening, reading and writing. On a typical day, I would go through maybe some sound flashcards, focusing on different sounds. We would look at some spelling, focus on sounds that they need help with. Reading - we would focus on their comprehension of what they've understood, obviously how they read as well. And writing - we'd make sure that we're using proper punctuation and structure. You know, there's different text types that we need to make sure that they understand this is what's in a narrative or this is in a recount. So we start then adding more details and we break it down into looking at the text structure more specifically and the linguistic features that are necessary to ensure that the writing's cohesive and meaningful. So, at each level, because we work so closely together, we're able to know what each stage is doing, and then build onto that. CAROL: 'Too' - long or short? 'Too'... Long! Good. (CHUCKLES) The main purpose of our EAL Program is to get these students ready to be able to work in their classrooms more independently. One of my main focuses is the vocabulary, so to make sure that the children are front-loaded with vocabulary that they're likely to use in their classroom. The children, at that stage, are very much more comfortable in the school environment. They're also very much more capable in terms of their understanding and use of English. So, it's a wonderful stage that the children are in. And when they come to me, I adore them, obviously, and I do a lot of language experience of shared experiences so that we can get involved in activities and tasks together and then write and talk and read about these. (READS) They breach like whales. Good girl. And you missed what word when you were... 'Like'. Yeah, I heard you say it. You just forgot to write it. Good job, darling. Off you go. Well, I like to do songs and rhymes to make them feel comfortable. And I often do that, particularly at the beginning of the year. We do some rhymes and songs, and it sort of takes away their inhibitions, then they start talking. And it's the best way, I think, to get them feeling confident and comfortable. What's the first keyword there, Jinston? STUDENT: 'Most'? 'Most', yeah. Who can help? STUDENT: Spend. 'Most spent'. Good. "Most of the time he spent eating leaves." What's the next keyword? There've been many students that have come through the EAL Program over the years, and it's actually really lovely to see how they have developed and grown. So, they've come in, they've not got a word of English, they don't understand how schools operate in Australia. They proceed through the New Arrivals Program, through Transition and into EAL. And you see the growth, you see how their understanding of language and their understanding of school develops and how they become competent learners in English and in the school system. I think the EAL Program at Dandenong North has a perfect balance. We are able to cater for the emotional needs, practical needs of the children as well as the academic needs. And once all of those things are covered, they're able to learn at the rate they need to to be able to go into the classroom. And I think we cover it beautifully. ROSEMARY: Australia is a great place to live because... Nagia? There's no war? There's no war. Australia is a great place to live... Everyone is kind. I guess everyone... everyone is kind. Everyone is kind. Abby? Fair. Fair? Yeah. Thank you. Cheyenne. Caring. Everyone cares. OK. So, Australia is a great place to live because... It's a free country? It's a free country. Fabs? And they have more education in the school. If this program did not exist, it would be a very grim and sad situation where the newly arrived students will be in their mainstream classroom, they will be sleepy, tired, because of the overload of sensory input because of the new environment and the new language being spoken around them. They may feel intimidated, they may not feel safe, they won't talk if that's the case. But they come to Transition and EAL - it's smaller group. They feel comfortable because everyone is at the same level as each other. From a teacher's perspective in the classroom, it would be extremely challenging. Curriculum is already quite dense and challenging, and classroom teachers have got a really large range of students that they have to meet the needs of on a daily basis. Having a child with no English or little English adds another layer to it, another dimension. If you have a classroom full of maybe 28 students, and you've got one student in that class that's come to the country with no English, they definitely need a more one-on-one intensive small-group program to help them catch up to where they are with the rest of their peers. New Arrival students and EAL students really do need a different type of program and teaching. It has to be very oral-based and it to have lots of visuals and needs to be broken into very small steps of instruction. Because what we don't want is for our class teachers to have to slow down the instruction rate of the majority of students. We've got intervention programs here that will bring those children up, but we can't bring down what it is that all the children need. You know, we're trying hard to make sure our high-achieving kids get what THEY need. Our children who are working at standard have to be taught at that level. And our children who are still learning or have learning gaps have to be catered for as well. Having this program just ensures that the needs of our EAL students are met specifically. Think of a noun, a verb and an adjective for... Let's do one together. OK? Can you think of a noun - something, a name of a person, place, animal or thing - that happens in summer? Sunscreen? Sunscreen, beautiful. STUDENT: Sunglasses? We have a special program called the Reception Program, and that Reception Program is a first port of call. So, we have one particular teacher that works with those children. Those children are assessed, they're given a thorough assessment, so that prior to going into, being allocated to, a classroom, we've been able to see what additional intervention programs they may require, any counselling that they may need. We will identify whether they need to see a speech pathologist. We'll identify whether there's a hearing problem. We also will check to see if their eyesight is in need of any support. A teacher that we think would be best suited for that child. Which children in the classroom might they get on with well? You know, we do try to match up where their might be some language similarities so that just for basic needs they've got a buddy. ROSEMARY: Caroline will assess students academically, also make anecdotal notes on anything to do with their behaviour or any other additional needs that she thinks need to be addressed. JENNY: So, when they arrive at the classroom door on a Friday afternoon, they're shown where to line up, they have their last session with the class, they have a seat to sit in, all their books are there for them, their bags have a place. So, by Monday morning they're ready to start and everything's familiar to them so then they don't have that fear over the weekend of what's going to happen. So it is a very smooth transition and it's had a large impact on the calmness of classrooms. Teachers know what to expect. They have an ILP already organised for them. The children know where they've got to go and at what times, or they're picked up by other children going to maybe EAL or a particular intervention. So, it's actually four phases. We're saying it's three phases, but that Reception phase needs to be acknowledged because it does a lot just to calm not only the children but the parents as well. SONG: ♪ It's as simple as it seems ♪ The twinkle in your eyes ♪ The way that time slows down... ♪ I'm from Afghanistan and I've been in Australia for around two... between two and three years. I came from Pakistan and I've been in Australia for about three years. I've been in Australia for, I think, five years, and I came from Afghanistan all the way here. I've been in Australia for about three years. My dad came first on a boat, and then he made our passports, so we came here. I came here when I was six, so six years I haven't seen him. In my own country I lived with my mum because my dad came, like, around four years ago. He came here and then he helped us to come to Australia, and I was, like, "Yes!" It was amazing feeling. I didn't know how he looked. He looked, like, different. And it was, like, the best feeling you can ever have... ..when you've been away from someone so long and then you see them. I was, like, really emotional and then I really loved seeing my dad because I haven't seen him in... for, like, a long time. And then when I saw him I was, like, really happy. SONG: ♪ So before you think to rip yourself apart ♪ Open up my heart and you'll find love... ♪ When I came to Australia, I didn't really know any English. (LAUGHS) I couldn't understand anything. When I came, I just knew 'hi' and 'bye' and nothing else. I didn't really understand what people were saying, so it kind of felt like I didn't belong, like, here. When somebody asked me anything, like, I was too shy to talk to them. When I went to EAL... ..it was pretty good. I felt like I was belonging there. I felt like I was learning more English, getting better. It has helped me a lot with my English, reading, writing. Now when we go to classroom, if, like, our teacher says something, I kind of do understand that. In grade four, I didn't really know how to make sentences, like proper. So, when I came to Transition, it really helped me. They helped me a lot by, like... ..each word and each word, and then they just took me to here now that I can talk. And, like, at that time, I always tell them, like, "What does this word mean? What does that word?" And then when they said it, like, the meanings, and then I knew where to, like... ..where to use it in a sentence. So, usually at home, after taekwondo, I go and help my mum with her homework. We kind of play 'teacher, teacher' at home. She's usually the student and then I teach her. And then the next day she go to school and, like, be proud of herself that she knows those things. But, sometimes, if it doesn't work out, the next day we work on the same thing so she actually gets it. When I first came, I was happy to be in here. And then like... And now it is about to end, the school's about to end, and I'm really sad to leave Transition. I just like this room and it's just like my second family. Uh... My favourite part about the school is the teacher and all the friends and student, how they support us. I like how they're friendly. My friends and the teachers and the students, because they really care about other people. They make sure that you are part of it. Yeah, they help you a lot. I feel it's like a family, like my second family, because it's just like everyone's caring about each other. Like, we all use the four Cs, which is cooperation, courtesy, common sense and care. I think Australia is the best place for me to live. I just love it. SONG: ♪ Open up my heart and you'll find love ♪ Love ♪ L-o-o-o-o-ve ♪ Love ♪ Mm-mm-mm ♪ Love ♪ L-o-o-o-o-ve ♪ Open up my heart and you'll find love. ♪ JENNY: So, the students, as they move through the different parts of the program, once they're mainstream, we can see that they've done the catch-up, they've caught up to their peers and performing very well. And as results in things like NAPLAN and other testing that's done within the classroom demonstrates that this movement has progressed and they're on track with their peers. Whether it's a formative assessment just by us listening in to the conversations that students are having, any form of summative assessment, all of our testing that we do, whether it's a pre-and-post writing sample piece, just to see what these students can produce in a writing, it just shows how much they have developed by going through the EAL Program. We track the children who are attending EAL and undertaking the NAPLAN assessments very closely. If you look at the NAPLAN results and you analyse them carefully, what we find is that it's the EAL kids who are often doing the best in terms of student-learning performances. JENNY: They've been taught explicitly spelling. They've been taught grammar. They've been looking at model text. There's a range of skills that we can teach them that will actually show us, yes, they're well on the way to understanding what quality writing is. As the Writing Extension teacher, I was actually quite surprised to see the amount of children, or students, that we've had come through EAL to attend, or be eligible to attend, Writing Extension. A student needs to be working above their curriculum level, and to have EAL students, children that have come in from a new country and not speak a word of English and be in a New Arrivals Program in Year 1 and then they come in in Year 5 and I have them as Writing Extension, it's just amazing. KEVIN: One of the most exciting developments of this program occurred in 2018, when we had the opportunity to partner with Emerson Specialist School. We've had many ongoing relationship endeavours with that school over the years, but this has been the biggest, where for the first time in a specialist school John Mooney decided to try to put together an EAL component. And we matched that with our talk for writing initiative. And we worked together because, without the EAL-experience background, it would've been hard for them, it would've taken them longer. So, we were able to work with them and do some PD, combine PD, and then share experiences and get that program up and running. So, it was a fabulous opportunity. (HAPPY MUSIC PLAYS) (MELODIC WHISTLING) JENNY: What we see in our families is that they have risked everything to get their children to this country to give them the best possible opportunities in life. Mostly families leave because of economic circumstances or war, and who wouldn't want to leave if you're dodging bombs and landmines and your faith is under challenge from a different belief system and your assets have been annexed, if you like, or taken away from you? So, you really don't have a lot of choice. You have to flee. And some of the stories where people have fled their home countries are just tragic. Some of our students come from detention centres, straight from detention centres as well. You know, whether on Christmas Island or whether it may have been in another country where they were probably treated quite harshly. I have noticed... I found that it is harder to teach children who've been through a detention centre or who have been traumatised. We have had parents who have kept themselves together just to get their children here, and, once they're in school and settled, they have breakdowns. If there is something on their mind and they're always going back to something that might have happened in their home country, whether it was an attack of some sort, they're not going to feel comfortable enough to learn about what they're supposed to be doing. They're going to be distracted. KEVIN: In some cases, I'm sure that children are reluctant to talk about the experiences they've been through. What we can do is provide a new pathway now for them and new experiences that are positive and rewarding and restore their faith in human nature. SONG: ♪ Hold on, hold on, on ♪ Hold on, hold on, on ♪ Hold on, hold on... ♪ When we were back in Afghanistan, as you know it's a warzone country, and, um... ..in the area that we were, it was surrounded with Taliban and everything, so I got family members killed in front of my eyes and they were going to take my dad away, so we had to escape, we had to escape. And... my parents got contacted with smugglers and they brought us this way towards Australia. We had to escape. Otherwise we wouldn't be alive today. SONG: ♪ Hold on, hold on, on ♪ Hold on, hold on, on ♪ Hold on, hold on... ♪ AHDIA: I think what shaped who I am today the most would be my primary school, the ESL classes that I attended. Because when we moved from Afghanistan to Australia, not only myself, but my mum and my siblings, we couldn't read or write the alphabet, so we had to start everything from scratch. We had no friends or family over here. And when my mum moved to Australia for a better life, like everybody else who does, but mainly it was for our education, because in Iran we were not allowed to attend a normal government school, and so Mum was like, "We need to find a better place." And Australia was the one for us. So, we moved here. Um... I was very nervous. Coming to Dandenong North Primary School with no English and not understanding the culture at all, it wasn't just those two being the factor - I also didn't go to school before that at all in Afghanistan, so it was all new to me. Not understanding English at all. I don't know how to react. I don't know what to say. I remember the first few weeks I was very nervous. I wasn't talking to anyone. I had a short mushroom haircut, sitting in the back of the class. And my peers were very nice, they were trying to include me, but I... really couldn't because I couldn't understand what they were saying. You feel like you're deaf because you can't communicate, you can't understand what they're saying. The only thing I could read was their facial expressions and their emotions. And then I was like, "OK, they're smiling, "so that means they're nice to me." (CHUCKLES) And that was the only thing I could relate. But then how much can you smile throughout the day? Yeah, it was pretty hard, but we got help. We had supporting teachers. They were really nice, gentle, just trying to, like, make me relax and settled in. I loved how I could take content from school and apply it at home. They wanted to teach us our kitchen, like, "What's a pot called? What's a spoon called? This is a stove." And our teacher, our ESL teacher, she got us to do a research first and then cook it. And she did the cooking, we just had to watch, and she would explain it to us - "This is spoon. This is knife. This is flour. We'll mix water." And I remember going home and I used to force my siblings on the floor and I used to cook and I'd be like, "This is spoon. This is pot. This is spaghetti." And my brother is like, "I don't like spaghetti." And I used to tell him, "Too bad. "You're going to watch me cook because it's cooking time." So, when I learned a few words or sentences, I was more confident to speak up in the classroom, in the main classroom, and do my homework without getting a lot of help from the teachers all the time. But at the start it was difficult, yeah. I had to go to the teachers every second, with the homework especially, or writing, like, essays or anything like that, paragraphs or stories, I had to go to them. But then when I learned a few or basic sentences, I could write what I was thinking, express my words much more easier. The ESL program shaped who I am today, I feel it prepared me better, because I had a such a wonderful time in my primary school years. I always wanted to be a teacher. I applied everything that we did at school at home with my siblings, my brother and my sister. And I used to always have this little made-up board at home and write on it. When I graduated high school, I always knew that I wanted to be a teacher, but I finished a Bachelor of Biomedical Science, and I wasn't happy. So, I applied for my Masters in Teaching at ACU, and currently I'm studying. I was in EAL for three years, and I was in Grade 6 then. And then when I went to high school, I didn't need EAL anymore. I was straight into mainstream English. I knew the language by then... (LAUGHS) ..I knew how to express myself, how to study more efficiently. Once I graduated from Year 12, I went to University of La Trobe. I studied double degree of Bachelor of Health Science and Masters of Orthoptics, which is what I'm doing right now - orthoptics. ('DREAM WORLD' BY MUSIC GALAXY DJ PLAYS) We were one of the first asylum seekers on the boat to come in 2000. I was seven, eight, and the boat driver lost his way, we ran out of petrol, we ran out food, ran out of the last, last stocks we had. We were going in circles. He had a getaway boat attached to the actual boat, so, whenever they lose their way, they just jump on THEIR boat and they go and then just leave you there. That didn't happen because... It happened before and people sort of knew that that's what they do, and none of us let that happen, otherwise we would've been stuck there, you know? God knows what would've happened. SOBIA: In our country, in Pakistan, when we were there, we were basically just trapped in this one area that's just full of our people. We cannot go outside that area otherwise you'll get killed. So, that's how it was. And my dad, thinking about that - he was jobless, he didn't have anything to provide for us, food, anything like that - so he decided that he wanted to come to Australia. And we would always, like, "Oh, what? "There's another country that exists?" You know? (CHUCKLES) And that's when, you know, things started to change for us. So, my dad came here in 2000 and we lived without him for five years. We didn't know where he was, even if he was alive, I don't even know, like, you know... And then we came here, saw my dad, we reunited. Majority of people in Afghanistan, they don't live long enough, you know, to see the world. You know, they don't have a very long life because of the really bad situation. Being safe, being able to sleep in peace at night, you know, not sleeping in your bed thinking, oh, any minute something's going to land on your house, you know? That compared to here, when I sleep at home here, everything's so peaceful and quiet and it's just amazing. It was very hard for us to adjust at the start, definitely, until I started Dandenong North. And that's when I started seeing that things can change. I felt that there was a connection and then I opened up and then they opened up. And then, yeah, we just became like a family. I enrolled to the school in Grade 4, and I literally had no English whatsoever. (CHUCKLES) It was a completely different place for me, different people, different language. I was just lost in my own world. First few days, I hated it because I couldn't speak the language and I couldn't learn. I just had to be there and learn from visuals - body language, looking at things, colours. When I first arrived, I had a broken tooth, and, like, my first two teeth were, like, broken, and Miss McLaughlin, she saw that and she thought, "Oh, the only reason she's probably not talking "is because she's probably shy of her teeth and stuff." And then, she got that fixed for me from the dental. So it was basically... they were, like, caring for me and all that. And then she was always trying to develop that confidence in me. I just started feeling comfortable with them, you know just talking. And back then I was really, really shy. So I just started really getting comfortable. I would ask questions if I didn't know something. Normally I didn't ask, didn't talk, did nothing. I was just the quiet one, never talking, just shy. All the teachers were doing beyond what they were expected to do as a teacher, you know? IT was, like, a safe place for me, coming to school. All of the skills that I've gained from Dandenong North just really, really helped me through my secondary college and uni. I finished my Bachelor Of Arts in Digital Media at Swinburne, which is in Hawthorn. And then for another year and a half I went to JMC Academy. I did a 3D class over there, 3D programming. I am here because of EAL. Like, I learned all my basics from there. I've learned my language from there. I went to high school, but, you know, it wasn't the same support as I had in primary school. And I took that from primary school and did my further studies in Psychology. And then now I work at Dandenong North Student Agency. Recently we have a child that enrolled from Pakistan, and literally I look at her and it just reminds me of how I was, you know? I've been through that and I know what it feels like for them. So, yeah, being as a welfare coordinator, I could... ..just like Dandenong North Primary School teachers changed my life, I'm there to change others'. Hello! ALL: Hi! ALL: Hello! BOTH: Hi! Hello! What makes me appreciate the most - I mean, I've always appreciated what we achieved from our ESL program - is going through my placements and seeing kids that are in different schools and they need that extra support and help, but, unfortunately, some of those schools can't afford or are not aware - I'm not sure what's the reason - the kids are not getting and they're missing out. I understand that teachers need to cater for everyone's need, but how can you cater for a child who cannot speak and read alphabet? That's very difficult for a teacher. Now that I'm learning to become a teacher, I think I would struggle. That child needs a one-on-one, sometimes, conversation, just to sit and have a normal chat. Doesn't have to be about content, doesn't have to be about knowledge. Just say, "How, are you? How are you feeling?" It's very important because I feel like that helped me to go through the tough time that my family went. Just Miss Jenny sitting down and, you know, talking to us, telling us, "How are you feeling? "Have you visited your mum? And... The EAL teachers, they got to know my family and myself more. And they knew where I came from and what hardship I've been through. And they were more gentle. And not that other teachers were gentle and nice, but they're all perfect. It's just that they had more connection and I felt more relaxed in that classroom. I could speak out more easily, and whatever we learn in EAL we could put it in practice when we went out into the playground, into the classroom. Just having a normal conversation of, "How are you feeling today? "Are things better? What can I do?" It makes a huge difference to that child's life. To be able not to participate in some of your activities on that day just because something is holding you back. Emotionally, physically, you're not there. And your teacher understands that and appreciates your minimum effort that you put in. It's important for a teacher. I think as a teacher you need to teach the child... everything. So you are the second mum or the second dad at school. You're teaching them how to behave, what's the right thing to do, what's the wrong thing to do. Building a relationship with a child is very important as a teacher, and once all of those stuff are met, then you can easily teach the child the content. If those basic needs are not met, it'll be very difficult for the child to achieve their best. Feeling very proud. At times, when I do have time, I come and visit the school, I thank the teachers - Mr Mackay, Mrs Mackay, all the ESL teachers. I'll never forget that, you know? I'm always thankful because if it wasn't for them, if... I'm just thinking if I was to be put in another school with no ESL programs, I don't know how things would be for me right now. I'll be sure struggling a lot. MA'SUMA: I feel like Australia has given me so much, the country, its people, so I need to give back as well. I'm not here just to take, I need to give back since I'm an Australian right now as well. Not just the Australian people, those that come here, just like myself, we're all Australian... (CHUCKLES) ..we need to see each other as one. I do have students that tell me, "Oh, Miss Sobia, I want to be like you when I grow up. "I want to be able to do all this stuff that you are doing right now." And it's just the most beautiful thing that, you know, you could get from your students. My mum, she has always been one of those people that would support you with your education - "Go get the education, you need it," you know? "Without education, you guys can't go anywhere, "and you have to learn the language, "you have to be able to study and stand up for yourself "and do everything that..." you know, "that you can." And back in our country we couldn't do that. We didn't have any education. We didn't have schools for girls. We did have for guys, but for girls we didn't. And, you know, coming here and seeing that girls can study and girls can do all this stuff, so we took that opportunity. SONG: ♪ One last ticket before it's gone... ♪ CLASS: (SINGS) ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ One last summer before it's fall... ♪ FATIMA: We had a good life in Pakistan. So... But because of the terrorism, we just decided... my husband decided to come to Australia. So, he came in 2011 by boat, and then in 2013 my kids and I decided... we came in Australia. I moved from Afghanistan to Pakistan and spent a long time there. And then my husband came to Australia by boat, and then he tried to organise for the whole family to come here. And we were lucky. We got the chance to come to a new country and have a safe life. SONG: ♪ To breathe... ♪ FATIMA: We have a mothers' group in DNPS. When I enrolled my boys in the school, I start coming to Mothers' Group and I was a very regular member of Mothers' Group. And I'm a good example of Mothers' Group because I got job in Dandenong North Primary School just because of Mothers' Group. As a parent, when I came to Australia, I was lost and I was really worried about helping my children as a mother. So, the mothers come in the program and we show them, especially the mothers that are new in Australia. So, we help them to understand the education system or maybe the school environment, the learning and everything. And sometimes they come with so many questions, like they are... ..they don't know, like, where to go for help if they need to talk to the teachers, if sometimes they need help with filling in the forms. There are many things they don't feel comfortable to do. And so they come here and we help them. Some mothers, they started with little English or... ..but now they are working in Australian workplace. And it is a good opportunity. And to come to learn things, to observe things, to get the ideas of others, it's very good, especially for the new mums in a new country. When I enrolled my kids in school, so one day I received a call that, "We have a mother group as well, "so we invite all the new mothers "if they wants to come and join the mother group." So, first, when I come, so it was really good. And from now it's nearly five years, I'm continuously... I never fade off of the group because it's so very beneficial. Our own culture, it is totally different from the English culture, so it gives us some tips and some ideas how to raise our kids, how to... you know, with our own values, we can raise our kids, but to help them adjust in a new country, but in a good way. What's so wonderful is that they feel that they're connected with the community, you know, instead of being at home because "I can't go and mix and join any other clubs. "I don't understand the language." They come, we have interpreters for them if they require that, but they learn that they're not the only ones feeling, you know, lost in this new world, they're not the only ones that don't understand tenancy agreements, they're not the only ones that don't understand what this note coming home is saying to them. You know, and they've left their family overseas. They're here by themselves. It just alleviates a little bit of stress at home. It's better for the children too. When I came in Australia, I have no family here, only my sister. So, now I have a lot of friends, and this is just because of Mothers' Group. We came here, we sit together, we CHATTER, and now I have a lot of friends. So it helped me to meet other people, to meet other mothers, and to know their way, you know, their ideas... ..sometime we share our ideas how to deal with our kids, especially when the kids have a bad time. And not only the mother group, also like a bridge, connection, it connects us with the school. The parents often invite us into their homes, all of us in the EAL Program and many of the teachers here too. The families are so grateful for what we do, they'll bring us food, they'll invite us around to their place to share their meals, they'll invite us to their parties. And it's a lovely relationship that we have. And it's great to be able to experience their culture, to sit on the floor and things that we don't usually do. Having Alia and Fatima here is great because they have a connection to someone who understands them. And I think if we... Yeah, the school supports that. And it's so important because they've always been isolated from education in terms of being part of what their children do at school. And we welcome them in with open arms, and they're very, very grateful, and that's just such a bonus, and the mothers just enjoy it so much. And it connects THEM with each other, and so they feel like a part of a school community. I feel myself very lucky and blessed to be in a country where I feel safe, where I feel I can say my point of view to others and I can put my voice up to... for my rights. And I feel so independent. When I compare myself to previous Alia, when she was living in her own country, and this Alia, this is such... this is a different person. Proud of myself to help those people that experienced the same difficulties and same situations as I did. And when I'm helping them, I put myself in their shoes, in their place, to help them in the same way as I was expected help from others, from my teachers, from people around me. So, I try to help them in the same way to make life easier for them in a new country. SONG: ♪ And you're beating ♪ Beating on my drum ♪ And you're beating ♪ Beating on my door ♪ Running faster ♪ Faster than my... ♪ If you can't communicate effectively within the language structures of the country that you live in, you are powerless, you have no say, you can't push your needs forward, you can't fully participate within the community, you're always relying on others to do that for you. Communication is the key, and EAL definitely is the door to, you know... ..to learn the language. AHDIA: Just reflecting back, I'm really proud that I could learn to read and write, to speak as much as I can, to be able to finish high school and actually get into a uni and get an education that I can help back to the community. I think that's something I'm very proud of. A lot of people can't go to school, and I have the opportunity to complete my Masters. I'm thankful for all these teachers and the principal, the whole school in general, just for being there when I came here. And thank God I came to this school and not any other school, you know? All the support that we had, not just myself, my family, it felt more like home. They settled in much more easier. And, if it wasn't for them, I don't know what we would have done when we came, yeah. ROSEMARY: The way that Kevin and Jenny Mackay lead the school and the expectations they have of their teachers and of the students... And I remember distinctly Kevin saying, "Treat the children as your own." And I think that's a wonderful philosophy to have and to work through because that's what it is all about, isn't it, these children and making sure that they have the best possible advantage in their future learning. Everything that we do for them here lays the foundation for their future learning. And, as an EAL teacher, we give them that gift, we give them that opportunity, that chance to be able to be part of society and community. I find that the leadership team at DNPS are visionaries. They have opened their hearts to all cultures, and they value the differences, the linguistic differences, they value those cultural differences, and they are very committed to providing and giving a good education to the community where it is most needed, which would make the most amount of difference to Australian society. JENNY: We have around 60 different cultures at this school and even more languages, I think, because of the dialects. What I see Dandenong North is... ..is a small representative of the United Nations, yet, we don't have fights in the playground. And I think that bringing together different cultures, different religions, different perspectives on how we live our lives, and actually working with that background core understanding within each individual just is so important. If we're going to have a safe and harmonious world, it's got to start with the children. And, unless we can bring them together... And this is why I value the work that we do at this school, and in all public schools - we really bring together so many different cultural backgrounds to form into one. So, I think that we start to develop a greater understanding amongst mankind by having kids saying, "Oh, no, my friend, he comes from here and they do this." Just by that... opening up that communication is just a fantastic opportunity. ROSEMARY: It's about facilitating their learning and it's about being a nurturer. So, not only are you teaching children, you are also being their friend because you guide them as a friend. You're also being a mentor to them because they can come to you and ask for support and help. You're a coach as well because you coach them on how to behave in society and how to participate in games and with friends and how to build relationships. So, for me, a teacher wears many hats. And I think, finally, being a teacher is being a role model. That's a very important aspect of teaching. I can't imagine not coming here every day and doing what you can for these amazing families. AMAN: Coming as a migrant, we feel the need to give back to the community and establish roots here, giving them a good education and literacy skills so that they are productive citizens of Australian society. And this is my way of giving back to the Australian society. If I can give them something that has them always believing in themselves, I think that's my biggest gift to them, if I can give them that. AHDIA: Every student that comes from a migrated family, they're struggling. Their kids, you might feel like, "Oh, they're not thinking as deep," but they do. I did. You think very deep, you think about everything - "How are my parents going to cope? How am I going to cope? "Should I give up my studies and help them?" But to come to a school that they support you and you don't have to worry about that stuff, it's nice. You don't have to worry about anything but yourself, to be a child, um... ..to be able to learn and not worry about anything else, it's nice. ROSEMARY: I feel that each and every one of the children that passes through our program and passes through Transition is MY child. I don't call them my students, I actually call them my children. And I say to them all the time, "I'm your school mum, you can come to me with anything." When they come back to me, it's like a little piece of me is coming back home, if that makes sense. I don't know how to explain it. I just love them. I... I love them. That's the only thing I can say. It is so rewarding working in EAL. I couldn't think of doing anything else. I wouldn't want to do anything else. And it's the best job in the world. What we want is to make sure that we can fulfil the family wishes and ensure the future of those children by making sure that they are, by the time they leave us, ready for high school, that they are on par with their peers across the country or within Victoria, at least, if not above. And they've given up everything, the parents, to try to set up a new life for these students. And, luckily, this school is able to meet that need in a wonderful way. We have EAL students coming back telling us, "I'm a medical researcher," you know, "I'm a doctor," "I've just started Law," "I'm teaching." We have ex-students teaching at this school, which is fantastic. Some of those children started in the EAL Program. So, for them to be able to be teaching here and empathizing and understanding the importance of a really quality education is just hugely important for our children. The ultimate purpose for our EAL Program is to make sure that all our children that go through that program become strong and effective contributors to the Australian society. SONG: ♪ Too many days in the darkness ♪ Without a glimpse of the light ♪ Runnin' tired and broken and scared ♪ But I swear I'll never give up the fight... ♪ One of my favourite parts of Dandenong North Primary School is the fact that I used to be a student here, and many of the teachers that I had as a student are still here teaching today. And that just shows what a great place it is, that we all stick around and, you know, keep doing the job for the kids. Everyone at DNPS is so caring, they're, like, lovely, they always are nice to each other. And I think the teachers work so hard to help us have a successful life. I like this school because everyone's nice and like a family and they take care of you. We're friendly and we have guidelines which make us, like, do the right thing. And our teachers are 100%. When I grow up I want to be a doctor because I like to help people. Robotic engineer or a medical engineer. Engineer that, like, designs robots. I want to be a dentist. Soccer player. A doctor. I want to be a racer. A doctor. A police officer. A teacher. A cricket player when I grow up. A doctor because I went to help people. I really want to be a doctor. A teacher. An engineer. A type of scientist when I grow up. I really want to be a voice actor. A teacher. A soccer player. An artist. I want to go to space and go to the moon. A nurse. A doctor because I don't want anyone to die. I want to help the homeless people. And after that my career is going to be a teacher. I really want to be a successful lawyer so... ..because I love freedom, I love justice. I want people to be free and enjoy life. I want to save the world. A teacher like my teacher. I want to be a teacher like the teachers at this school. Dandenong North Primary School - the greatest school in the world.
