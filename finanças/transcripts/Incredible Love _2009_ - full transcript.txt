You're still alive? Darn! - Will have to do this again. And cut! Let's move on to the close-up. Hey! l hope you don't have to do it again, man. You can do this all day. Come on. - l can't. l just tried. All right. See you later. Man, what a shot! You jumped, and it looked like it was Brandon there. Anything for Hollywood, man. Another great shot as usual. lt's a pleasure always doing stunts for you Mr. Brandon. Don't forget about the poker game tomorrow. l'll be there. l'll be there. l think you have a visitor. Not for me. Must be for you. You're the cool dude. No, you're the player. Viraj. Excuse me. Hi, beautiful. You left me in the tub. Baby that was three days ago. But l waited. l'm really sorry. l will make it up tonight. l promise. Oh.. Viraj! How is he going to get out of this one? Brother, lots of practice. ''l am a bad boy.'' Brother, whose house should l take you to? Let me think. Phone. We're not deaf, moron. Thank you. Hello. What? Scoundrel! - What the hell! Do you Lucky Doshi take Kamini Sandhu.. ..as your lawfully wedded wife? l do. - Do you Kamini Sandhu take Lucky Doshi.. ..to be your lawfully wedded husband? l do. l now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. My wabbit. My pumpkin. My tweeny. - My love. Stop! Brother? Brother. Why? Because l love her. Do you know what love is? Brother. - What? Love will clip your wings. You won't be able to fly. It will make your life hell. Kamini is not like that, brother. She's a girl, isn't she? - Yes. That's it. She is like that. ''Don't want to love.'' You forgot me because of her? You didn't even think about me? ''Don't need to love.'' - Brother.. ..you don't think before you love. You just fall in love. Here we go again. But l never forgot that you are my guru. My everything. But you can't be my wife. What? - Brother, love. l can't have children with you. Why do you need to get married? Why these complications in this simple life? Lucky you know our job is such.. ..that if we get married, they will do the stunts.. ..with our hearts and our minds. What is it? Hey. Are you happy with her? - Yes. All right. You've made a mistake. l hope you don't regret it. Father, you can say whatever you want to. You may now kiss the bride. Brother.. - Not me. Kiss her. Stop! Bebo? ''Bebo.. Bebo..'' Bebo? ''Bebo.. Bebo..'' Bebo? - Brother, who is Bebo? - How would l know? ''Bebo.. Bebo..'' Are you out of your mind? Why? - You've destroyed your life by getting married. What will happen to you now? What will happen to your career? What career? l'm just a lingerie model. That's also a career. That's it. You are married. Now forget about modelling. Within days you'll get pregnant. And then kids. Really? Lucky! lf you are so fond of marriage and kids, then do it. But why him? What? - What? l mean, if you can get originals.. ..then why are you getting married to this duplicate? When you can have any man, why marry this cheap imitation? What? - A body double? Time out! Excuse me! Why should l? Miss.. Why am l giving you so much respect? You! Are you here to break up their marriage? Or to insult us stuntmen? Why should l insult those who are an insult in themselves? What do you know about stuntmen? Who wants to know about you? Second-hand people with second-hand lives. Second-hand? We do everything in real, not those heroes. We have the guts. We're fearless, we are honest. We have integrity. You've learnt a couple of English words living in Hollywood. You uneducated, filthy lout! Shut up you stuck up, uptight little witch. l know how to shut up girls like you. Oh, yes? - Want to bet? Really? Fine. How? Let me see what you can do. Beat me? Hit me? That's what you guys know? You can't shut me up. Today, l will speak what l think about you. About your friend. And about this thing. And about your community! You can't shut me up! We are the ones who got married. Why are they kissing? Love your strawberry lipstick, baby. You.. Don't. Dog! Witch. ''Wretched love.'' ''Wretched love.'' ''Don't want to love. Don't need to love.'' Brother, what are you doing? Just relax. Brother, you've not Iearnt anything from me. l've told you several times that women.. ..are good for only two things. There's nothing called love. All men are interested in only one thing. What? Please, Sim. Come to your senses. You've been mistaken. Lucky has married me, but hasn't even touched me. Because he knew l didn't want all that before marriage. When he couldn't do anything else, as a last resort.. ..he got married to you. So you've not done anything yet? Brother.. - You're still a zero. - Brother.. Score zero-zero? - Brother.. What's wrong with you? Brother, it will happen. It will happen. Take this. Protein shake. l've added Viagra in it. Viagra? - Yes. Brother.. Oh, yes. l forgot. You're in love. lt's all about sex. And l can prove it. How? Don't let him touch you for three months. But Sim, we've got married.. Let's see how long your marriage lasts. Just test his love. Sim, you'll see. Lucky's Iove will top every test. Brother, you know nothing about love. Once you fall in love.. - ..it gets you into trouble. This darned love is like that. Didn't understand? Let me explain. Hey! ''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that.. '' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that.. '' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''Wretched.'' ''She intoxicates you with her eyes.'' ''She invites you with her dark hair.'' ''Then she takes you in her graceful arms..'' ''..and leads you to the gallows.'' ''Wretched.'' ''First he comes to you..'' ''..as if begging you to love him.'' ''And if by mistake you lose your heart..'' ''..he treats it like a football.'' ''You must be foolish..'' ''..to fall in love.'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''He says he'll worship you.'' ''He'll love you forever.'' ''The first girl he sees..'' ''..he changes his mind.'' ''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.'' ''Kambakkht.. Kambakkht.'' ''She tells you to bring her the stars.'' ''And then she will marry you.'' ''Do I own the uniyerse?'' ''Have l rented a rocket?'' ''The one who takes the wedding vows..'' ''..is bound to be ruined.'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Kambakkht Ishq is like that..'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''Once in love, you are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed.'' ''You are doomed. - Kambakkht Ishq..'' Oh my God.. - Come on. No.. - Come on! Someone hit brother with a bottle. - Where? Over there. Brother! Who hit me? Who hit you, brother? - l don't know. l'll beat up everybody. Tiger! Tiger! Brother? Brother, sorry. Brother, no. Stop. Stop! - Why are you hitting me? Hey Stop! Hey Lucky! You! Baby, are you okay? Baby, what's wrong with you? - Brother! Don't support the women! - Tiger, let me go! My wife is crying. Let go! Oh, baby! l'm so sorry. Baby, l can't.. l am so sorry. l'd like to thank the groom. And his friends. Sorry. They've done what l couldn't. They've shown Kamini that if you get married to a stuntman.. ..you'll get to see all kinds of stunts everyday. Congratulations, guys. Who threw the cake on brother's face? Shut up! Shut up! Look, have l ever asked you for the cheque? lt doesn't matter if it's Iate once in a while, dear. Okay, bye. l'll call you later. Who were you talking to, sister Nim? No, Sim. Nothing important. lt was Chunky. You're absolutely right. He's nothing important. Bebo.. - How often have l told you not to call me that? Anyway, why did he call? l said it was nothing important. When you were going through a divorce.. ..and you used to come here and cry all night.. ..you used to say the same thing, nothing important. God, Sim. Focus on positive things sometimes. Nim, what's positive in all this? You are unhappy. Mom was unhappy. lf there are men involved, then we have nothing positive left in life. What should l focus on? Focus on yourself. And on your life. Hello, girls. Hello, Aunt Dolly. You sisters don't like me at all, do you? What are you saying? There! Same thing again. When you call me aunt, it feels like you're abusing me. Just my name sounds great. l am alone, and so is my name. You shouldn't say such things. You're not alone. The two of us are with you. We're the three musketeers. Always together. Dolly, Sim and Nim. Go away! That's the problem. l don't want to be Raavan, Kumbhkaran and Vibhishan. Nim, Sim and Dim. Sim, you're not normal. At your age, you should have had a four-year-old kid. lf you want, l can get pregnant tomorrow. Oh! Sex is easy. But who will get you married? Your aunt? That's the point. My aunt didn't marry, so why should l? Your aunt didn't marry because of you. l was getting good proposals and they're still pouring in. Kapoor has proposed me twice. And he got divorced twice as well. Wretch! If you don't want to get married, then don't. But why are you casting an evil eye on my marriage? l'm still hopeful. Well, forget it. Look what gift l've brought for you. Oh, no! Look what l've brought for you. 'Whenever Aunt Dolly brings something.# '..she brings me some new trouble# Look what l've brought for you. - 'Oh, God!' 'Aunt Dolly's gift is equal to terrible problem# Look what l've brought for you. lt's a drape for the wedding gift. lt will prove very lucky for you. You'll get a proposal in a jiffy. Proposal? The same thing again? l said l don't want to get married. All right, so don't. It's Goddess' gift. You shouldn't refuse it. lf not a wedding proposal, it will prove lucky.. ..in your desire to be a surgeon. My name should be in the next roster. They say that l just need to assist in one more surgery. Then l'll be a surgeon. Thank you. For surgery? - Are you crazy? America, land of opportunities. How much for a hotdog? - Two dollars. One, please. - All right. Yes. - Thank you. What? - Needle! This should be in the haystack not in the hotdog. First you bill me, then you want to kill me? You want to be Keswani killer. - No. No. Take it easy, buddy. Nobody's trying to kill you. No. No. What no? You know, you put a needle in the hotdog. l'll sue you. - No.. You'll be sued. l will sue you. There's no bigger litigator in all of America. This has never happened before. l have never died before. Death and shit wait for no one.. ..they come anywhere, anytime. Sir.. - Needle in the hotdog! - No. No. He wants to kill me. - It's all right.- What? Why? - l'll give you the hotdog for free. Free hotdog? You're joking with me? Free hotdog for one life. - Okay. l want lifetime supply of hotdog. - Okay. Okay. Whatever you want. Just don't sue me okay. - You promise? l promise. - Hold this. - Just don't sue me, okay? Stand here. - What? - Stand here now. Come on, smile. Smile. Say needle. Hey Jack. Italy? Well, no thanks. l'm not taking up any more assignments. l just did that to pay up for med school. But thanks anyway. Bye. Aunt Dolly! Hello, Keswani here. Jhoothlani there? Hello Jhoothlani. Coincidentally l met with an accident. God is great. What yes? Do l pay you to agree with me all the time? You've been my Iawyer for so many years. You still haven't understood me? Keswani has got a case for you. Yes.. This is really a Iand of opportunities. God bless America. Do you know Sarah made it to the list? Hi. - Hi. Have you seen Dr. Ali anywhere? - No. Speak of the devil. - And the devil appears. Congratulations Ali. You made it to the list. - Yes. Your first surgery. Thank you. And l'm sure your name will also be there in the next list. And then you too will be surgeon. Right? Step on it! Buck up! Buck up! Hurry up! What's this? You're trying to get more fees by delaying. l understand all this exploitation. There are so many needles in my body. Are you going to make a tattoo on me? When will you operate on me? ln a few minutes we'll give you local an aesthesia. And then we'll shift you to the operation theatre. Local? Why local? Why not imported? Such discrimination? l understand everything. There's one more thing. Don't mind. You're going to operate on my stomach.. ..then why don't you remove my appendix as well? lt's right next to it. lf something goes wrong, we'll adjust among ourselves. You scratch my backside, l'll scratch yours. Do you get me? Mr.. lt's not mister. It's Dr. Ali. Doctor? Don't mind. You look more of a nurse than a doctor. Excuse me! - As it is, l don't get along well with doctors. You know what l mean? When l was born, l didn't cry, but the doctor did. Ask me why? - Why? The doctor held me upside down and slapped me twice on my backside. Dad scolded him for hitting his child and sued him. Analyse this. The one who doesn't pee on being born but sues the doctor.. ..will become a big litigator. Where are you going? Hello! Nurse! Oh my God. Miss! Your clothes. My towel? - To hell with you! Take it. Lucky, you've come after a week. Want some breakfast? What happened to her? Whom? The girl who just left. What did she do? Yes brother, at last night's party.. ..l thought the girl was sweet and innocent. lnnocent? Did you say innocent? Are you crazy? You should hear her talk. She's so abusive. Her sentence starts with the 'F' word. There's the 'F' word in every sentence. Brother.. - Not that word. F for future. She talks of the future all the time. Our future. Your future. We'll do this in future. We'll do that in future, darling. l am fed up. And to whom am l telling this? The one who has destroyed his future by marrying. Tell me, how is sister-in-law? That Kamini. ''l am a bad boy.'' l haven't touched her since marriage. So will your wife allow you to touch her at an auspicious time? No, brother. l think sister-in-law is suffering from touch disease. Not touch, she has been possessed. Simrita has possessed her. Simrita has told her that if l love her, l will not touch her. And according to Simrita, l don't love her. So l will touch her. So, my lovely, hot, dumb wife has decided.. ..that we have to prove Simrita wrong. l am losing out. What do l do? She is so hot! She tempts me all the time. And then she disappoints me. Brother, poor Lucky. Brother, l'm driving. That frigid babe. There's no action in her life.. ..and she doesn't allow others to get into action. Brother, how do you know there's not action in her life? l know such girls very well. They look hot, but are cold from inside. But my wife is a sizzler. She's so hot! l can't see anything else but her. What can l do? Be a man. - What do you mean? She is playing games with you. So give her something to play with. Give here a toy. Give her a toy. - Toy? - Yes. Make her pregnant. Give her a child. She'll play with it all her life. Brother, you're joking, right? She doesn't allow me to get close to her.. ..and you're saying l should make her pregnant? This is my life, not a mythological episode.. ..in which l can look at a girl and make her pregnant. Don't worry. Pray to God. He'll give it to you in a jiffy. This is his. What's this? - God gave it to me. Oh, my God! Move it! Move it! Come on. Bring him. What happened to him? lt's a case of milk-o-magnesia. Because of an accident he has lost his memory. - What? Don't you know what amnesia is? Are you illiterate? Memory? Where am l? Don't you watch movies? Who am l, sister? Sister? - Aren't you shocked? Now he will go up. - No! He'll not go to heaven. He'll go upstairs, to his room. The more you love him, the closer he'll get to you. Look, as soon as he saw you, he smiled at you. Come on.. - Go on. Go on. Give him love therapy. Go on. - My baby. Give him love therapy. Go closer. - My wabbit. My pumpkin. My tweeny. My sister. No! Are you crazy? Why are you shouting? Lower you voice. No! No! He has lost his memory. He has not gone deaf. No. No. - Sorry. Okay. Do this. Pick him up and take him. Gently! Remove his clothes. Remove his pyjamas.. ..and find your husband. He'll be there somewhere. Come on. Let's go. Doctor? - Doctor. Yes. Little. Dolittle. Dr. Dolittle. Which hospital? Hospital.. Hospital Universal. And why are you here? Yes, Lucky. He lost his memory. Amnesia. To solve his problem. What have you prescribed to him, doctor? One Paramount injection with Miramax mixed together.. ..and amnesia is solved. Then you must have got your medical degree from Columbia Tristar. ''Bebo..'' Brother, shall we remove the wigs? Wouldn't stuntmen become heroes if they knew acting? All fake. All men are the same. Cheats, liars, zero moral fibre, low IQ.. You want to see how Iow a stuntman can get? Kamini, l've not come here to get insulted. Then are you here to insult people? ''Wretched love.'' Sim! Sim, please. - ''Wretched love.'' Baby. Baby! Brother.. Forget whatever happened. Because believe it or not, we're going to Italiano. You must have heard the saying. - Which? When in Rome, do the Romans. Just imagine. You and me in Milano. Brother, me too. - Yes, you too. The ramps there, and tall eight-foot girls doing the catwalk. Their legs reach up to here. Supermodels. With their soft sleek hands, they will feed us pasta. Brother, pasta with mozzarella? - Absolutely, with mozzarella. Let's go then. - Yes, come on. - Lucky! Brother, you can go. - No. Come with me. No, brother. You can go. - Come on. Come on. Cancel his tickets. - Okay. Sim, isn't it an irony? Do the surgery, and then collect money for the surgery. Money? - Yes, don't you know? _5000 for the registration? You have to give it before the first surgery. l've received a memo. 5000 dollars. Ali. - Yes. l just remembered. l have to make an important phone call. We'll catch up later. Okay? - All right. Hey Jack. That Italian job? Is that still on? Great! l'll be there. Thanks. Hi Jack! Oh my God. Hi Tiger. - Jack, hi. Sit, brother. What the heck! - Sorry, man. You? - Yes, me. What are you doing in business class? Show me your boarding card. ''Don't need to love.'' Bank balance, credit card, property papers, grocery bills.. ..would you like to check all these? They're all up there. ''Don't want to love.'' Excuse me. - Miss, please, take your seat. We're about to take off. Come on, sit. You'll fall down. Hurry. Come on. What happened, ma'am? Didn't you take a bath? Excuse me. - Yes. Can l please change my seat? Certainly, miss. Let me check it for you. Seat 2B is free. Hi. Can you just tell me where can l go and sit? l don't want to sit here any longer. Of course, sir. You take that seat there. That one? - Yes. - Thank you. Can l help you, sir? Please, can you get rid of her? Please. Excuse me, ma'am. You appear to be disturbing your co-passenger. Sorry. You? Why are you following me? lf l were following you, l'd have had to take the window seat.. ..by climbing over you like this. Had l come like this, you would have felt it. Good or bad, you would have surely felt something. Be quiet and don't disturb anybody. Sorry about her. Dog. - Witch. ''Wretched love.'' ''Wretched love.'' Cut! Put that in the can! What will it take for you to get down? Belisimo! Great reaction. You like it? - Yes. Sure. Why don't you call the female model now? Okay, l'll call. Come on. Nice. Brother! Money. - l know what you're talking about. Excuse me. What? - This is the model? You? What are you doing here? So darling, like l told you earlier.. ..you'd be sitting behind him and move yourself forward. And get close to him. Okay? As l call 'Action', feel the love. Feel the love. ''Don't want to love.'' ''Don't need to love.'' Ma'am, have you come to Italy to die? - What? No, l mean, l have no objections. lt's just that the bike is not insured. What? Hold on tight, if you don't want to fall off. And like the director has said, feel the love. ''Feel the love..'' ''Feel the love..'' ''Feel the love..'' ''Feel the love.'' ''Feel the love.'' ''Feel the love.'' ''Feel the love.'' Cut! What will it take for you to get down? Superb! Superb! Great shot! Now let's get the real hero. God, originals are just so much better. ''Don't want to love. Don't need to love.'' ''Don't want to love. Don't need to love.'' l'll just be there. Sim, this is Alexandra. Your type. Excuse me? - You like girls, don't you? What? You like girls, so l thought.. - Why did you even try to think? lt doesn't suit you. Listen to me. - What's your problem? l don't have a problem, you do You have a problem with men. l have a problem with you. - With me? What's wrong with me? l am hot. l am good in bed. And l've not done anything to you. - And you never will. You're not so lucky. Listen you creep! l have no interest in you, any other man or any woman. Wow! No action! l'll die before l let a guy like you touch me, okay? Such attitude? Such attitude! l think you'll die before anything does happen to you. Hey! ''Such attitude..'' ''Come on.''

Hello, Mother. Slowly. You? - What is she doing here? Mother, what is she doing here? She's going to be operating. She'll operate? She's a model. ''Don't want to love. Don't need to love.'' No. She can't operate. l've not come here for a ramp walk. She can't operate. She can't even wax properly. He's just hallucinating due to pain and anesthesia. How much profile have you given him? 10cc. Give him 5cc more. No 5cc. She's going to kill me. Mother. She emptied five bottles inside me. The whole bottle. Save me. She is a wretch. No, not her. That's the other one. She is a witch. Witch. She'll murder me. Stop her. What are you doing? Making a tunnel? - Shut up! ls my body your dad's property? Are you searching for a way to Dubai? Come on. Kill me. Kill me. You'll go to jail. l will sue you. Stop preparing this chutney. l will sue you. l will become a bikini model. And l will also become a doctor. l will model for briefs and vests. Thank God. God should save me now. Call my friend.. He works in a laundry.. Doctor, this is the patient's report and X-ray. - Thank you. Where's the patient from 516? l have no idea. Viraj! Run! Take me and run! You should have said that. Come on. Come. Open the door quickly. - Where are you going? l'm going home. l'm your doctor. You can't leave this hospital without my permission. Did you pay the bill? - The entire bill. Nobody can stop me now. l'm going home. How can you leave? - How can l? Watch me. What? Hey, don't touch me. l.. l mean.. - What do you mean? l have to check. l have to watch you. You've made a hole in my belly. What else do you want? Viraj, why don't you understand? No you understand. Had l known that you'd operate on me.. ..l'd have died instead of allowing you to operate on me. Just try to touch me. All my lawyers will sue you. Enough. Out. ''Mangalam.. Don't want to love.

Not just for a hospital, but for a profession. Who was the doctor-in-charge? Simrita Rai, you've been negligent in carrying out.. ..your duties as a doctor.. ..because of your personal differences with the patient. You're hereby barred from medical practice. Excuse me.. Dr. Rai, how could you be so careless? Nimrita.. - Why did you put an innocent man's life in danger.. ..just because of your personal differences? Why did you ruin your years of hard work? Why Sim? Sister Nim.. - Don't call me sister. l can't be your sister. Sister Nim! Sister Nim? What happened? l was just practicing 'Shavasan'. Sorry. l had a bad dream. You are doomed. Do you think l don't know that? But what should l do now? What will happen to me? You? What will happen to the one who has a watch in his stomach? Sim, what will happen to him? lf there is an infection, he's finished. And even if he doesn't, he'll be in trouble. He'll be pissing blood. He'll be.. Sim, if the watch reaches his lower intestine.. ..he won't be able to pass his stools. You'll end up in jail and your career will be finished. Ali! - Not Ali, now only God can help you. Even if he survives, he will sue you. And you will commit suicide, you'll hang yourself. You are doomed, ruined, finished. You're life is.. - Shut up! Relax.

Lucky, listen. l want to ask you about Viraj. Ask what? Whether brother is alive or dead? l'm sorry to inform you. l'm sorry to disappoint you rather.. ..brother came back alive after you operated on him. Lucky, why don't you understand? l am Viraj's doctor. l want to do a post-op check-up on him. The stitches have not been removed yet. He could have an infection. Oh, God! He could have an infection. Why is she being such a pain? - Pain? - Pain? Where is it paining? Where is the pain? Why didn't you tell me before? Oh, God! 'Shanti' (Peace). Hello. Who is this Shanti? Your sister-in-law. l thought her name was Simrita. Man, tell him to stop. Else l'll break his legs. l swear l will. What are you doing, Tiger? Couldn't you find any other girl? Could you only find a girl.. ..who doesn't give brother any importance? What? She doesn't give me any importance? Obviously. She doesn't give me any importance or l don't. Come on, brother. l know all the girls want you.. ..but she's hardcore. Even you can't charm her. She hates you. You carry on please. l'll drive her crazy. l'll make sure she sleeps with me. You're fired. You're fired. Hey, pay her. You're fired. Please go. She listens to everything. - Loser! Nosy cow! - Brother, relax. And then? And then l'll do to her what she did to you. She broke your heart. l'll break hers after playing with her. ''l am a bad boy.'' Seven days. - Seven days. Done. What's all this? These are flowers, Sim. l know that. But for whom? 'They say every flower has a meaning# 'For example, happiness, love or friendship# 'When l think about you l don't understand.# '..which flower l should send you# 'l thought l'd play it safe. So l've sent all the flowers# 'Viraj# Viraj? Viraj? Who is he? Nobody. He's a creep. Creep? l wish there was such a creep in my life. l'd get such lovely flowers. 'Today is an important day for me# 'On such occasions, it is important that friends are with you# 'And to announce the next category.# '..please welcome on stage the very beautiful Holly Valance# Good evening Hollywood. Best stunt coordination and or second unit direction.. ..for best stunts during an entire film of any genre. And the award goes to Viraj Shergill. And to give away this award, l'd like to invite someone.. ..who's not only a superstar, but a legend in the world of action. Now, l'm not really a big fan of his. l just happen to know that his next film is releasing in.. ..eight months, 26 days, 35 minutes and 14 seconds. Thirteen seconds. Please put your hands together for the man.. ..the legend, Mr. Sylvester Stallone. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. My name is John Rambo. But tonight, ladies and gentlemen is not about me. lt's about the real heroes behind the action. And it's my real privilege to give this award to someone.. ..who is my real life hero. To the man who takes the fall as the director yells action. And the good looking hero.. ..rolls up in the continuity and dusts himself off and says.. ..''l'm your worst nightmare.'' lt's my absolute pleasure and honour to give this award.. ..to a man without whom, many of my recent films.. ..would have never been what they are. The incredible, Viraj Shergill. Viraj, why don't you say a few words? When l was a young boy in Punjab, l used to tell my mom.. ''Mom, when l grow up, l'd like to be Sylvester Stallone.'' l can never be Sylvester. Nobody can. But this middle class Indian boy.. ..has worked every day of his life to be able to stand next to him.. ..on the same studio floor, to be able to take the fall for him. To be able to say.. ''Look mom, you son has become Sylvester. Look.'' ''He may be a duplicate, but he has become Sylvester.'' ln India, whenever something big like this happens.. ..we seek the blessings of our elders, our parents or guru. Tonight l'd like to take the blessings of the guru of action. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. ''Om Mangalam Mangalam.'' ''Om Mangalam Mangalam.'' ''Om Mangalam Mangalam.''

What the hell! Let's do it again. l'm so sorry. - That's all right. You scream pretty well. Thank you. You're performing stunts so soon after the surgery. That's bad for you. Come to me once for the check-up. Let me check if everything is all right in there. ls this a circus? Is there a circus going on here? - No. Come on, bring me the protein shake. Brother, l just gave it to you. l know. l want the other one. The soya-bean shake. Go bring it. Let me check it whether this is good for you or not. What happened? Why can't you look happy? Yes, it's fine. ls it good? - Yes. Why wouldn't it be fine? You've added so many things in it. l added? - Yes. - What? You've added something. Sweetness, kindness and goodness. All right, l'll leave now. What's the hurry? When will we meet again? ln half an hour. Such eagerness? Bye. ''l am a bad boy. l am good boy.'' ''l am a bad boy. l am good boy.'' Do you have the money in the bank? Nothing has happened yet. lt will happen in half an hour. Hey! - You! What's wrong? You said the pills will take affect in half an hour. Yes. So? And you said that every patient of the studio is brought here. Yes. So? Yes, but nothing happened. Hello. Hello, Sim. l'm so worried. Why are you worried? You know Lucky has not come home yet. So, l called up the studio. They said a stuntman has been taken to the hospital. l just hope it's not Lucky. lt's Viraj, not Lucky. How do you know? l hope it is Viraj. St. Martin's is not too far away. St. Martin's? What do you mean St. Martin's? That's the hospital name. Why St. Martin's? What do you mean why? l'll talk to you later. Sim! Sim, what's happening? Sim, tell me. Sim? 'Oh, God! He has got an X-ray?' 'Oh God!' Brother, that.. Viraj! Where is your watch, ma'am? Where is it? Where's your watch? Viraj, please try to understand. My life is in your hands. Have you gone mad? l'm sorry, Viraj. l had forgotten the watch. Forgot the watch? Where? Where did you forget it? You said you'd be back in half an hour. l've been waiting for four hours. Where did you forget the watch? Did you forget it at home? What? - Yes. Did you leave it at home? l had forgotten the watch at home. l had forgotten the watch at home. l had forgotten the watch at home. - Brother, she is mad. Oh, Viraj! - Brother! Brother! - Sorry. l swear l'll never drink your protein shake. Brother, my stomach's hurting Take him away. Take him away. Lock him up in the washroom. What were you saying? How can l talk here? This is not the right place. l want to meet you in private. Brother! - Excuse me. What happened to him? ''Bebo.'' Brother.. Listen, what do you do if you want to control someone? What do you mean someone? Whom? You know, guys. Guys! Well, usually l smile. Not you, l am talking about a normal person. Why? What do you want someone to do for you? Not me. l was just asking to improve my general knowledge. Usually, if you request politely, then people will do it. No, l can't do that. You? No. No. My friend was asking. But you said you're asking to improve your general knowledge? Whatever the reason might be, do you know the answer or not? lf l knew it, l wouldn't have filed for divorce. And if you want to know, then why don't you ask Jackie? With her short dresses and her sweet talk.. ..she brings everyone under control. Right. - Okay. All right, call you later. Bye. Let's go for a swim. Okay. So where are we off to now? lnside. To swim? Yes.. You do have a bathtub, don't you? You know where it led last time. l know. You do know that l want to have golden babies with you. With your skin, my eyes, your hair and my smile. They will be so beautiful. Yes, they will be striped babies. You never take me seriously. And if l do what you'll do. Try me. ''l am bad boy.'' Her timing is always wrong. What did you say? Oh, my God! Denise Richards? Nothing, l was just thinking why don't you go inside.. ..and l'll get champagne. You go in. l'll come. So, you're going to be shooting in Brazil? Busy? - Yes, but.. Excuse me. You? Yes, me. And that was Denise Richards, wasn't she? Yes, that was Denise Richards. l don't like Hollywood girls. They are so bland, you know. You understand? l like a girl l can take home. And tell mom, l want to marry this Indian girl. lndian, you know.. - Which Indian girl are you talking about? Someone l want to meet in private but she.. She too had come to meet you alone. But Denise Richards got the same idea then what could she do? Does she want me to throw Denise Richards outside? l'll see you tomorrow. Hotel Venetian. Room No.$01 at $:30pm.

Yes, there is. Good. lt's a very strong dose. What are the symptoms? My heart is beating faster. l am breathing faster. Me too. Why? Why me? You know, you're very sweet. But why were you so mean earlier? You too were so mean. That's because you're so hot. And you used to think that you could trap any girl. But l was wrong. ln the past few days, l have realised that you're not like that. You're not, are you? No. You know, my dad was like that. My sister's husband is like that. But you are not like them. You're not, are you? No. They think they can fool the girls and take advantage of them. As if girls don't have a heart filled with love. But you are not like them. You're not, are you? Are you? No. What happened? l'm talking too much, am l not? No - So kiss me. You'd said you knew how to shut me up. ''Hey you.'' ''Every breath of mine is close to you.'' ''Why are you burning from inside?'' ''Hey you.'' ''l'll be with you all night.'' ''And talk to you about love.'' Bebo. ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''l am really, really nervous.'' ''Don't stop me.'' ''My life is bound to you.'' ''Don't go away from me.'' ''To be away was just an excuse.'' ''l wanted to take it slow.'' ''l didn't really know.'' ''Our love is like a quarrel.'' ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''Take it.'' ''On the sly..'' ''..why do you turn and look at me?'' ''l am all yours.'' ''Every guy tried to woo me.'' ''l was not impressed.'' ''One glance from you..'' ''..has claimed my heart.'' ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''Bebo. l am Bebo. Take away my heart.'' ''l've come with my heart, take it.'' ''Fall in love.'' ''Fall in love.'' God is great! Hot baby doll. lt seems you too didn't sleep last night. Earlier l had thought l'd sue you. But now l think, why should l? What if we come to a compromise? lf we can get into a compromising position.. Get out! Get out! Security! - Sim? What do you think of me? All of you are the same. All men are the same. Hey, come. Come with me. They want only one thing from girls. Scoundrels! Mr. Keswani, what is your problem? What? What is your problem? What is my problem? Now you're going to be in big trouble. Fool, first you left this watch in my stomach. - Watch? The watch is ticking while l'm talking. Wa.. Wa.. Watch? - Watch! Watch! Watch? Oh, God! Mr. Keswani, this is not your X-ray. Stupid! Idiot! Son of a gun! Give me the good news. Then whose is it if not mine? This is Viraj's X-ray. Keswani, there's nothing here for you. You wanted to say something to me? l want to give you something. Go wear this first. Go. ''Don't want to love.'' ''Don't need to love.'' Scoundrel! ''Wretched love.'' ''Wretched love.'' ''Wretched love.'' ''Don't want to love.'' ''Don't need to love.'' ''Done want to love.'' l don't believe this, Sim. Kamini? Lucky told me everything, that you and Viraj.. Don't take his name in the same breath as mine for as long as l live. But you love him, right? There's nothing between Viraj and me. lt was just an act. You know how much l hate him. When l was operating on Viraj, l left my watch inside him. What? - l was really afraid. lt was the question of my career. l thought l was going to lose everything. When nothing else was working l pretended to be in love with him. l was so worried. l'm not that foolish, Kamini.. ..that l'd fall in Iove with a guy like him. What are you doing here? What were you telling Kamini? The truth! lt's such a relief. l was fed up of pretending to love someone l hate. Sim.. Dr. Simrita Rai. Now l won't have to hear you call out my name. lt feels like an abuse. Now just get out! Hey.. Hey, you're just joking, right? You're just joking, right? Kamini, what did l tell you about the IQ of a stuntman? They're just so freaking dumb. Freaking idiots. Why did you do this to me? l did what l what was right. l treated you like you deserve to be treated. But l deserve you. l love you. We were going to get married. Marriage? Who's going to marry a sick scoundrel like you? God! Just get out. Get out! God, he just doesn't get it Cut! Yes.. cut it.. - Okay. Great shot Viraj. Moving on. That was a great shot. He loved it. - Thank you. That was a great shot, brother. Viraj. - Hi. - Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? Well, is there anything l can do to help you? Marry me. Marry me. You always jokingly say that you want golden babies. Yes. So what if l say yes. Then? Then l'd say yes. Hey Denise, the shot is ready. Say when and we'll go get a ring. Hi. - Hey. How are you? - Great. - Good. What are you doing, brother? l want to see.. ..whether a sick scoundrel like me gets married or not. Why are you trying to remove this ring? What's wrong with it? Viraj gave it to me. Sim, Viraj proposed? This is great. God has finally heard my prayers. Come on, decide on a date. l've also got a proposal. l will also say yes. We'll get matching wedding outfits. And take our vows together. Stop it! lt was a bogus engagement. And for all you know, this ring might also be fake. Fake? Of course. How can l ever think.. ..of getting engaged, married or be in a relationship. After what happened to Nim and with mom? What happened to your mom? You were just a year old when they separated. How would you know? Did your mom ever tell you anything? No. What could she say? Could she say that she got into an arranged marriage.. ..because her parents forced her to.. ..but she couldn't love her husband? Or could she have said that.. ..her husband tried to save the marriage.. ..but she was very stubborn? Just like you. She didn't give in to him. Finally, your father gave up and went back to India. And by the time your mother realised her mistake.. ..it was too late. Your mom told me all this, not you. She told me to see to it that her daughters.. ..don't repeat her mistakes. Do you think l enjoy nagging you to get married? Don't l know that you think l'm just a joke? And that you're putting up with me just because of your mom? l pity you. l'm putting up with the burden which your mom passed on to me. lf you had told him the truth.. ..brother would have himself come in for the operation. Listen, you know nothing about me. l know everything you did the other night. Just shut up! - Why? Sounds terrible to hear the truth, doesn't it? l feel worse thinking you were ready to do anything that night. But for the first time, my brother controlled himself. He.. he didn't.. No Simrita. He did not sleep with you. l think he should have. But he didn't do it. Maybe because he loves you as much as l love Kamini. Just because of your ego, you've broken two relationships. Yours and Kamini's. lt's our divorce hearing tomorrow. Good luck. ''Why have the flowers lost their colour?'' ''Why have the flowers lost their colour?'' ''Why am l so cross with myself these days?'' ''Maybe in one of our meetings.'' ''l said something wrong.'' ''False promises were made.'' ''Because of some excuse.'' ''l found you, and then l lost you.'' ''lt was my mistake.''
