Hey. -Hey. Do you know what time it is? The Sabbath is about to start. I'm here. -Really? That's strange, I can't see you. I know, I'm only a minute away. So, our "new" car got stuck? Actually the car was okay. Then what really happened, Hananel? gave a Palestinian a ride. What? I gave a Palestinian a ride and then... we got to a checkpoint so we entered the Palestinian Authority. Then a gigantic Arab chased us with a sledgehammer and the Palestinian police was shooting at us, but... we ended up cuffing them to their car. And I'm a minute away, I'll be right there. Wow, Hananel, that's the most unoriginal story you've ever come up with, but I thought it over, and if the car is that important to you, we'll manage. -I'm not... Okay, you're not. Come home already. -Okay, all right. I love you. Munzir. Here. No. It's yours. -No. Munzir, Abu Moustache will give you a hard time with the dowry. It's time for me to buy a new car. It'll bring you good luck.
