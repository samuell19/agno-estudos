You should come down. You'll see it can't be repaired. You never come down! You haven't been down in years. It's not your business, but you are the boss... Keep a woman on a short leash so she knows her place. You know what I mean. I'm no brute. But you need structure-- Could you pick the kids up today? I want to go out with the girls. You want to sit with us? I'm eating with the girls. Don't forget to get them, okay? Who's that? What? Who? That woman you hired today. Why wasn't she sent to my office? She's not an employee. She's the new quality inspector. She's replacing Bori. She's already due? No, she's taking the last two months off. So we've got this woman now. I'm not too happy about it. How come? She's pretty stiff. We might have problems with her. She talks like this place came out of her shiny ass. Maybe she's just shy. First day and all... Maybe... See? Just what I was talking about. I'll go introduce myself. Don't dare call her Marika! I made that mistake. Bon appétit. I'm Endre, the financial director. Mária Rácz, quality inspector. I see you chose the garden sorrel, too. It's the only good food here. Not much else though. Except the shredded squash, maybe. I always have pottage here if I can. You know why? Perhaps because your arm is crippled. It's easier to eat mash with one hand. Look, Marika... May I call you Marika? Your friend surely mentioned that I find it unpleasant to be called that. Really? No, he didn't. Then I was wrong. Pardon me. I find it unpleasant. Sorry! Two? Yes. How much, Laci? 875. Thanks. Bon appétit! I'm Endre, the financial director. Mária Rácz, quality inspector. She seems to be lonely... that's why I came over here. I'm a bit scared. I don't know what he wants. She must be nervous. I'll pick an ordinary topic. I see you chose the garden sorrel, too. It's the only good food here. And shredded squash. And the shredded squash, maybe. Not much else though. I should answer him now... and then we'd be conversing already. Hey! Don't walk all over it! Okay, sorry. I'll get your coffee right away. I'm making yours in a sec! You're in no hurry, right? Here you go. And he says it's not overtime! Why on earth not? Look at her huddled alone in the dark. Should we ask her to join us? Their kind has coffee upstairs. Bori always had her coffee with us. That was Bori. Well, I'm asking her anyway. Hello, doctor! Hi, guys. I don't add salt, to keep it soft. Only after. Józsi, this is Grade B? It fucking is. I can't believe it! I work out. Three times a week. There won't be a problem with my strength. People always say... I should do something with my excess energy. I'm not aggressive or anything... What else can I tell you? After my training I worked at-- I'd like to ask you something, young man. What's your name again? Sándor Markó. Sándor, what do you think about these animals that we process here, so to say. I don't think anything. What should I think? Don't you feel sorry for them? Not me. Bam! Is there a problem? Blood never bothered me. Look, if you don't feel sorry for them it's not going to work. You can't work here like that. So it was a trick question, right? If I say I feel sorry for them, I'm neurotic. You'll have a breakdown. Find some other job. So you're not hiring me? Is that it? Hello? This new chick is labeling everything Grade B! This nice cattle! I see. Should I talk to her? No, don't do anything! I'll come down and talk to her. I'm not the HR manager. You're already hired. It was just friendly advice. It certainly is cold here. So, how do you like working with us? Thank you, everything is fine. I won't beat around the bush. Look, the girls said you're labeling everything Grade B. The cattle seemed quite nice. Don't you think? I do. Then what was the problem? They were fattier than regulation. Much fattier? No. About 2-3 millimeters on average. You've got hawk eyes. 2 millimeters... Yes, I have good eyes. That's true. And that makes them all Grade B? That's what's in the regulations. The regulations... I see. Yes, they are my guidelines. What is it? Did hell break loose again? Yes, two bulls need fast sedation! The paper from the doc? I'll give it to you later. Okay, but don't forget 'cause they'll kick my ass! Sure. I'll have it sent up at the end of the shift. Why? Isn't she at her station? Second day and she's already no show? No, she's there... sitting motionless, like this... Makes you feel real creepy. Then where's the paper? She started to fuss about. I got the fuck out of there. Here. But I didn't hear any of this. Got it? Where did they find her? No idea. I invited her upstairs for coffee yesterday. And? You don't see her anywhere, do you? Well, Snow White has arrived. Look, they totally froze up. I'm going to the hairdresser's today. Can you pick up the kids? Sure. And we need groceries. You can do both at once. Buy some pudding. The powdered stuff? Yeah. And bread, milk, bologna-- Write a list. Okay. And we got a new quality inspector. Mária something. Yes, that's her. You don't say. She is precise as hell. No, whoever you send us is fine. Okay, I'll tell her. We've got a problem. It's holiday season. We're lacking two people for the night shift. Looks like we've got a new rooster in the henhouse. You were a pole dancer. Look... He's met his match. I've come from the robotics department. So the good doctor will... stamp me! He's making a fool of her! So what? What's going on here? The cops are here. I can see that. So? I dunno, but I can only let employees in. Go upstairs, they're interviewing everyone. What did Pista say? The cops are here. Who are they after? How should I know? This is very awkward. I have no idea who it might be. Not even a wild guess. The cabinet was locked, as always. There's nothing more I can say. There's no point. It's full of prints. István, get the lady to the office. This way, please. Relax, it'll be fine. You got a tissue? No. Sorry about this. He's never been to a slaughterhouse before. Yes, one has to get used to it. Here's everyone who has access to the medicine cabinet. One of them is me. It could have been one of us. What is this mating powder anyway? Is it really that strong? It's strong and works fast, too. A mating is done in three minutes. It's not so funny for us. I hope we can settle this quietly. A story like this? No way. That 50th class reunion, for example. Yes, it really does get your instincts going. But jumping at each other like crazed animals? It was developed for cattle. A bull weighs around 400 kilos. Boss? Where should I...? A speedy result would be nice. We don't want this to happen again. Are you feeling better? Do you have mental hygiene screenings here? Sure. The next one is in two months. Great. Has anyone's behavior changed recently? I mean, anyone acting weird? Unhinged? It's hard to tell from up here in the office. Listen, run the annual screening now. Let me recommend someone. She's worked for us in the past. Okay, but... who'll pay for the psychologist? Us, or...? Well, it's worth the price, right? The steak is in the striped bag. Well, are they satisfactory? Pardon me. Date of first seminal emission? Excuse me? Ejaculation. I'm sure you remember. Pardon me for my staring before. That's okay. It happens. Well? Is this a real question? Look, these are regulation questions. This is how you started with the butcher boys? The question order is not set. But yes, I asked them all and they all answered. That must have been a real experience. I see you're embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed! Relax. There's nothing personal in this question. It happens to all boys, right? Come on. Try and remember. All right. I was 10. Next question? 10? It's a bit early. Are you sure? Yes. Fine. Tell me what you dreamt last night. It wasn't anything special. Yes? I dreamt that I was a deer. I don't know what you'll conclude from that. Probably nothing. So you were a deer. And? That's about it. I did things deer usually do, I suppose. Like what? I wandered around in the woods. Drank from a stream. Stuff like that. Were you alone? No. I was with... There was another deer. Was it another stag or a doe? A doe. Are you certain or just assuming? I know. How? Did you mate? I'll have to disappoint you. We did not mate. We wandered in the woods, looked for grass. But only found a few juicy leaves. We had to dig them out from under the snow. We went down to the stream, to drink. Our noses touched when we drank. That's all. I didn't mount her, I didn't fuck her. And I don't want to mount you either. I just looked at you, like any normal man would. Again, I apologize if I was insolent. But I'd like to start the real work now. Of course. Sure. Your intense reaction is very interesting. Do you perhaps have any erection problems? Is this part of the questionnaire? Your response was so heated it seems logical. You said you ask everyone the same questions. May I ask you to adhere to this? Sure. When did you lose your virginity? C'mon, tell me what they asked. I dunno. A bunch of nonsense. What's my favorite food or if I get dizzy spells. She also asked me what I dreamt. I'm not telling her that, no way. I'll say I don't remember. She can't read anything into it. They know if you're lying. That's how the questions are put together. What's the woman like? Her tits are this big! So what did you dream, honey? I'm not telling. - Come on! - No! Okay. I dreamt I was sitting on a light-blue horse-- Really funny. Whatever, forget it. Too bad, it was nice. Tell us what you dream, Zsóka. You don't want to know that, honey. I just made a fool of myself. What do you do in your dreams? Me? I fuck. So... time of first menstruation? November 5, 1998. Any surgery? None. Contagious illnesses? Chicken pox. When? March 21 - April 7, 1990. You remember this so precisely? I just do. I see. It's rather unusual. Is there a reason for it? No. Okay. Tell me what you dreamt last night. You don't remember? I do. I'm just thinking of how to tell you this. I'll be ready in a moment. Sure, fine. Please. Yes? It would be easier without this noise. What noise? Sorry. It wasn't nice of me. I've had a long day. But I'm really listening now. Tell me your dream. I was very hungry. I rooted through the snow, but there was no food anywhere. My companion helped me search. He found a thick, juicy leaf under the snow. He let me have all of it. I ate it. It didn't taste bad... ...just a bit nauseating. Afterwards, I felt strange. Were you an animal in your dream? Yes. What animal? Can you tell me? A deer. Go on. What else happened? We went down to the stream. Your companion... Well... Did you mate? Why don't you answer? I was just waiting for you to find what you were looking for. Did you find it? Yes, I did. Thank you. So, then? No. What do you mean? We didn't mate. Right. But was there physical contact? His nose touched mine. Our noses touched when we drank. Tell me why you're doing this. Doing what, doctor? As you wish. Send the next person in. They called you back in? Don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing. Relax. Stop touching me. Leave me alone. There's no problem. Okay, forget I said anything. I want to know about your little private joke. You think it's funny? I need to evaluate the material. And the dream analysis is a part of it. Okay? Yes. Then tell me what you really dreamt last night. Not what the two of you arranged. I'm just trying to do my job. I don't care about anyone's private life. I want to go home, take a shower. That's all. Doctor, maybe you've overworked yourself? It happens. All right. I dreamt that I was a deer. I don't know what you'll conclude from that. Probably nothing. So you were a deer. And? That's about it. I did things deer usually do, I suppose. What an odd coincidence, right? Anyway, I just wanted to say... we don't have to feel awkward. We're adults, after all. Right? Yes. Actually, it's kind of funny, no? It is funny. Bon appétit. How's the meat? The meat is satisfactory. I always end up with leathery meat-- What did you dream last night? I didn't dream anything. Too bad. Then I'd better go sit elsewhere. I prefer eating alone. May I? Don't think I consider you a leper, too. Did they find out who did it? No. Well, I've got a tip. Don't wanna hear it. Personally, I don't think it's you. We'll see what that shrink lady comes up with. She's a silly goose. She really messed with my head. I'd bang her though. Don't you even want to know whom I suspect? Tell me, I know you want to. I think it's obvious. That guy Sándor... I don't think he's got all his marbles. The way he's all over the women, and the mating powder and all... You know what I mean? He's a sex maniac. What do you think? Isn't it logical? Yeah, it makes sense. We better tell the cops, right? Could you return my tray? You're the one in contact with them. Well, in my dream I was a deer again. Like in every dream I've been having. And... There was this doe. Where? In a forest, where else? Actually... This place is kind of strange. Beside a small, round pond. I've never seen such a small pond before. I mean, in real life. How about you? What nice things did you dream? This. What? - The same as you. - You're just saying that. I'm not. I don't believe you. That's okay. I wrote it down. I'm sorry. Well, see you tonight, then. Tell me... Why did you run away? I looked for you at the lake. Are you angry? Hello, doctor. You look gorgeous today. Looks like the boss thinks so too. Excuse me. Just a professional question... ...I bet your legs are... Coffee? May I come in just this once? No, you may not. Come on... You know that regulations forbid that. We'll just have our coffee and I'm gone. Is that all right? I just want to discuss something with you. You shouldn't take that guy Sándor seriously. Okay. Men sometimes talk a load of nonsense. What did he say to you? Never mind. It's not important. Here is my phone number. And I will enter yours. I don't have one. I didn't mean to impose. I really didn't mean to impose. That's not how I am. And what did you say? That I don't have a phone. So what's it supposed to mean? What do you think? Perhaps he didn't believe me for some reason. Very good. And could you explain why? Maybe I used the wrong tone of voice. Or forgot to make eye contact. No, I made eye contact, I did. His pupils contracted. Look, these days everyone has a cellphone. Maybe that was the reason. It's strange to talk to you like this. Yes, Marika... You're a grown-up woman. It's strange for me, too. Maybe I could give you the number of a colleague who works with adults. Or just buy yourself a phone. Hello. You came down early today. Bon appétit. I'm buying a phone tomorrow. You have a phone... You just think I'm old and my arm is crippled. It makes me feel bad. I think you are beautiful. I don't believe you. There are three things that can give away a liar. Shall I teach you? Okay. Number one: the pupils. If the pupils dilate-- Pupils dilate according to light changes. Don't try and make a fool of me. I know why you're angry with me. I'm not angry. Today I went to-- Someone explained to me-- I don't care what you discussed about me. You probably made fun of me. He said you must be jealous. Is it true? Are you really jealous? Yes. I think you fancy that guy Sándor. You're mistaken. Come on! You're wrong. I'm afraid of him. Is that true? Yes. Then everything's all right again, right? I'm totally stressed. Why? Forget it. Listen... Back in the day, did you screw my wife? Christ. So you did. I know she's slept with half the factory. Sándor's on the agenda now. Come on. I'm not a complete idiot. Whatever. We've been through this already. You got an aspirin? Hello. You came down early today. It's 1:30. I didn't come early. I'm buying a phone tomorrow. Then buy one. I think you are beautiful. I can't believe this. What's going on? Did you hook up? Are you crazy? Why exactly do you have mating powder at a slaughterhouse? Well, it's not really legal, but not illegal either. Sometimes we help with mating. Private deals, no papers. But it's not a whole lot of money. It's not making us rich or anything. You can report it if you want. No way. Don't worry. I just couldn't fit the pieces together. The meat was really good. Béla... The usual. Hey, boss! What did the cop want? What are you doing out here? You're my dad now? It's nice outside. Go back to work. - Don't make me say it again. - What'll happen if you say it again? Are you gonna beat me up? Quit this job, son. Before you get into real trouble. What are you talking about? I know you did it. You've hated me from the start. You're right. Smart boy. Dad, I don't ask you that often! That's not what I said. What do you spend on, besides smokes? You never even have a crust of bread at home. I stopped smoking four years ago. All the more, then. Listen, kid. That's my business. Look, the situation is this... Will you get it? Yes? Hello? I bought a phone. - Is this a bad time? - No, it's fine. Will you call me tonight? We could fall asleep together. Well, that's a great idea. It really is. Later, then. Who was that? A colleague. You don't know her. Hello? Yes. Good evening. Well, I'm going to bed now. All right, then. I've already taken my sleeping pill. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly. Look, one more thing... You don't have to be afraid of me. Sorry, forget it. I know I'm a little ridiculous. Sleep well. It was lovely. We could go out for lunch tomorrow. I could take you to my old favorite place. Hello. Well, did you find anything? Just one person, but, you know... it's not actual proof of crime. Who is it? Jenő Vári. The HR manager. Are you surprised? Are you 100% sure? In my profession, you can't ever really say you're 100% sure. But it's a very strong possibility. Here is my report. Shall I forward it to the police? No need. We'll do it. Did you give us your invoice? Yes, sure. Thank you for coming in personally. Goodbye. Just out of professional curiosity... Your colleague's dream... Did a similar coincidence ever happen again? I suppose you compared dreams since then. No, we didn't. Goodbye. So it really was a joke? You arranged it beforehand? Yes, that's exactly what happened. I'm sorry, it was a childish idea. I apologize. Goodbye. Well... What did the great shrink come up with? Nothing much. How come? She thinks it was Sándor, too. Really? So, what now? Do we fire him? What do you think? Will you tell the cops? I suppose. I'll call them tomorrow. Right, of course. These tests... They don't mean much. It was stupid to do it in the first place. Whose idea was it anyway? It was my idea. Sorry. It wasn't Sándor. No? I know it wasn't him. Really? It was me. I don't know what got into me. I just got fed up. Yeah, it happens. Sometimes you just get fed up. So... What now? Nothing. Don't do it again. But-- No one got hurt. They just had a weird night, that's all. The police will close the case after a while. They're not too concerned about it anyway. It was nasty of me to blame it on Sándor. Yes. But you know-- It was. Sándor! I want to apologize to you. I'm sorry. And we can be on a first-name basis. Thank you, sir. I mean, thanks. We could have a beer together. If you don't have any plans. No, I don't. I'm free all evening. You want to hook yourself a man, doctor? Yes. That's not how you do it. How do I do it? You're nice and tall. You should wear clothes that show it. Don't dress like a waif. Turn around. Nice ass, too. I've never noticed it before. Stand up straight. There! That's worth more than any fancy clothes. But the way you hold your head... Chin up. Not that much. Then you'll seem cocky. That's what they say about you anyway. Movement... People underestimate the power of movement, honey. The effect of how you move. Look... You don't need much. Too much ruins everything. Now... Walk along here. Show me. Chips. Tissues. Two? Sure. Listen, do you have any proper aftershave? I do. Thanks. Strange... This place was always packed. Hello? Hi. The food here is great. Lunch? Yes, if it's not an inconvenience for you. What do you mean? Never mind. Forget it. Tell me... Does Janos still work here? So you wanna have lunch or just chat? I have an idea. I'd really love to sleep with you. Nothing else. Just sleep in the same room. Fall asleep together. And when we wake up we can talk about what we dreamt. What do you say? I can't sleep right now. Me neither. What should we do? I'd better go home. Stay. Let's talk. Okay. About what? Well... Let's play cards! I don't know how to play cards. I'll teach you. ...and ten. I call. Sixteen. Incredible! How are you so good at this? Be honest. Did you know I was bluffing? I thought you were. But how? You couldn't possibly read my face. I was so careful. I didn't move my face at all. Exactly! You didn't twitch at all. But how did you know what I had? I remembered the cards. My memory is abnormally developed. It has its downsides, too. You simply remember everything? Your first sentence to me was "Bon appétit." That's not so hard to remember. Then we introduced ourselves... I remember it, too. Your fifth sentence was: "You chose the garden sorrel, too. "It's the only good food here. "Not much else though, "except the shredded squash, maybe." God, that's incredible. What about, say... the 17th sentence? "I won't beat around the bush. "Look, the girls said you're labeling everything Grade B. The cattle seemed quite nice. Don't you think?" Good God... That's uncanny. But are you sure that was the 17th? Shall I start from the beginning? I believe you. Did I misunderstand something? You know... I closed this chapter of my life a few years ago. There were women... Thinking back now, fewer would have been better. Then, when... There was a point when I said, that's it. I'm out of the game. And I was fine with that, till now. And now... Do you think it's so easy making a fool of myself now? Will you get the kids from school? I have to go to the hairdresser's. Sure. Then you can buy groceries... Are you sure you don't want to talk to an adult therapist? I am. Look... I don't know what to say. This is just like anything else. Observation. Practice. I'm doing it. I watch three different series and porno movies. I don't recommend that. It's physical contact that causes your problems, right? Yes. Well, then practice that. Do you have a pet? No. That's all right. I don't really know what to say. Try this, for instance: close your eyes, put your hand on your face, and caress it gently. Like this. Try to touch all sorts of-- Is it possible that two people dream the same thing? I mean, that they meet in their dreams? What made you think of this now? Can it happen? Look, you're a smart woman. You're a university graduate. I don't understand this at all. Another thing that might help is music. It can also have a mood-altering effect. I'd like to listen to these. Won't that be a bit too many? No. Do it. You've got time. Sorry, we're closing. We're closing! Did you like any of them? I don't know. What are you looking for? Love music. What? Music for people in love. And you didn't like any of these? Listen... I'll show you my favorite if you want. Will you listen to it? No, I'll buy it. Damn it... For fuck's sake already! The boss... That wasn't so bad, right? I don't know why we ever stopped. Don't miss your last bus. I'm staying over. We'll have a good sleep. Don't be silly. What's your problem? You can't sleep here. Why not? I don't get it. I can only sleep alone. Since when? I'm serious. You can fuck me but you can't sleep beside me? Don't be stupid. Are you crazy? You want to kick me out in the middle of the night? It's only after 11. Stop it already. Don't make me mad. Good night. I have no idea what to eat. The ratatouille was pretty good yesterday. I'm having salad. - Hello. - Hello. I could sleep over tonight. I brought my pajamas with me. Look... I've been meaning to tell you... I don't want to hurt you... But there's not much point in doing this. Right? A risotto please. I thought it over last night. We're just not cut out for this. It just wasn't working out. What would you like? Cream of celery or potato soup? Celery. At least we tried. It's no tragedy. We can still be good friends. Of course. Actually, it'll be easier this way. No more tension, right? Right. Bye, then. Hello? - Good evening. - Good evening. I don't really have a reason for calling. - Am I bothering you? - No. Are you having a pleasant evening? I was listening to music. But something's wrong with the player. I'm afraid it's broken. I didn't even know you liked music. Actually, I don't. Just this one song. But now I can't even listen to it anymore. Too bad. Well, yeah. All right, then. Bye. Have a nice evening. You have a nice evening, too. Sorry... - Hello? Are you still there? - Yes, I'm here. I... I feel like I'm going to die. I love you so much. I love you so much, too. I'd like to... look into... Can we meet? Yes. I'll hurry. There's something I need to do. It'll take a little while, but I'll hurry. We need to keep you in for a few days. The psychologist will come to see you tomorrow. The nurse will show you your bed. I'm sleepy. Let's sleep, then. Will you slice the tomato for me? Sorry. Here. - Would you like some cold cuts? - No, thank you. By the way, what did we dream last night? Somehow I can't remember. I think I didn't dream anything.
