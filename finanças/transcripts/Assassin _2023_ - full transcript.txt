[voice echoing] This is not my body. This is not my body. These are not my hands. This is not my body. [relative] Dad! Dad, I told you to stay in the car! Why didn't you stay in the car? This is not my son. Dad? [grunts] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. [panting] [machine beeping] [spouse] Hey, sleeping beauty. My mom's traveling from Cape Town next month. And if you don't wake up... she's gonna smack you awake. [sighs] [spouse] "And in the aftermath, she thought of all the times they had been there... together. And the promises they made. No matter where we are in the world... however strange or distant, however far... or impossible... [laughs] ... however cruel or painful... I promise you, I will never die, unless I'm looking into your eyes." [gun clicks] Three months. Three months in a coma! Are we gonna do this daily? What happened to Sebastian? How does a fucking drone pilot land up in a coma? Tell me why I shouldn't fucking kill you! Because you're not stupid. Get in the car. [door opens] [door closes] It's on me, what happened. If I could explain it, I would. Let's get you home. [spouse] Who's this? [door opens] [bike rattles] We got a problem here? [grunts, pants] [grunts] [grunting] [groans] [crying] You all right? Who's she? Alexa. Sebastian's Alexa. What's going on? They won't tell me anything. [crying] I have a family, please. I've never harmed another person before in my life. [whimpering] Who are you? Call Harmon. Yeah, about that... [reporter] Senator John Harmon, chair of the armed services committee, was fatally stabbed today by a longtime aide who says he has no memory of the attack. What is this? What's happening? [boss] Everyone, get in the car. Yeah, I don't work for you. You do now. [bell dinging] This is not a good idea. Where are we? Someplace safe. You really think she can handle this? [machine whirring] [sniffs] What's this? Subject of my postdoc thesis. Well, plus my Hawkings-level brilliance. Just put her in. You ready? If you want answers about Sebastian, you've gotta put this on. Step into the tub. [whispers] Oh, hell no. I worked with Sebastian too. I promise it will all make sense. It's the only way to get him back. [sighs] [ice rattling] [inhales sharply] [gasps] The ice will numb you and help you let go. Mm-hmm. Just remember these words: "This is not my body." This is not my body? "This is not my body," say it. This is not my body. [whirring] [current crackling] Wait! [muffled coughing] [coughs] [Alexa] This is not my body. This is not my body. [panting] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. Hello? Who are you? [both grunting] [machine whirring] [both grunting] [whimpers] This is not your hand. This is not your body. [gasping] [whimpers] What did you do to me? It's all right. What the fuck did you do to my hand? [agent] Your hand is fine. Relax. We just digitally mapped your consciousness into another person's body. You told me that he was a drone pilot. This is the future of drone warfare. [agent 2] If you can't get to someone, we can. We kill the bad guys. Somebody else takes the fall. It's just that simple. This is crazy. This is sanctioned? [agent 2] Do you remember the Midway shooter? The police couldn't get close. Yeah, his sister killed him. Her finger was on the trigger, but Sebastian was controlling that finger. This is Adrian Delorio, the fixer's fixer. He can smuggle the Obamas into China and an entire cartel into Texas completely unnoticed. This is Adrian's crypto guy, who can make millions disappear and reappear. Except, it wasn't him at all. Sebas-- Sebastian? He was in about a week. Adrian must have sensed something. [breathing heavily] Wha-- What's he doing? Stealing my tech. It's completely untraceable. Burrows right into the brain stem. [Alexa] So what happened to Sebastian? What happens when it gets pulled out like that? It's like a file transfer that crashes mid-download. Gets corrupted. So will he ever wake up? If you can get that spider back, yes. It won't matter if we're all dead. Adrian's coming for us. All of us. So you're hiding. [agent 2] No. We're hunting. [whirring] So how does this work? The brain is just an electrical system, and any system can be hacked. Sorry. That is your drone. And this is your target. How do I come home? You close your eyes. You feel yourself, your real self. It's been there all along. Then you say the words you know are true. This is not my body. [agent 2] First, the occipital lobe. Then sight. Then sound. [birds chirping] Then the limbic system. Motor control. And last... feelings. Your mind screams. It resists. So you remind it, "This is not my body." [Alexa] Who is he? Do you really wanna know? I'm about to kill a stranger in another person's body. I want to know. [agent 2] He's Adrian's transport guy. Traffics underage girls out of Morocco. We take down Adrian's crew. We flush him out. We find the tech. And then I kill him? [speaking Arabic] [grunts] [body thuds] [Alexa] This is not my body! [gasps, screams] This doesn't feel right. He was a bad guy. You've killed bad guys. Yeah. Not like that, I haven't. Do you know how many soldiers I've sent to Iraq so we could live? Nobody has to be sent anymore. You have plenty of other people that can do this. I do, but I can't trust them. Why? Adrian could be any of 'em by now. Now, make this work. [crickets chirping] [dog barks in distance] [Alexa groaning] [panting] [whispers] Olivia. Olivia! Hey, Olivia. [switch clicks] Why am I pregnant? Hey. Why am I pregnant? What's happened? It's memory contamination. You were just a pregnant woman. I can feel it kicking. I can feel it kicking. Pull it the fuck together. I got this! Back off. [Alexa] No. What? Oh, my God. Hey, you can't be them without feeling what they feel. That's physical sensations, emotional states. Okay. Yeah. I need you to make it stop. I can't. Please. Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Here. Do you feel that? [gasps] There's nothing there. You're not her. It's you in your body. What? [gasping, chuckling] I'm not... Huh? Huh? [Alexa, Olivia chuckle] [chuckles] [sighs] So do they know? Do the hosts know what we've done to them? Mmm. No. When you're inside, it's like they're disconnected from everything we think of as consciousness. It's like sleep, but no dreams. You can stop touching me now. Sorry. [switch clicks] [whispers] She is a mess. You never should have brought her here. She'll be fine. Fine? Sebastian lasted months before his memory contamination. How long does she have? Who the fuck cares? Get her the fuck out of here. Not gonna happen. Then I'm leaving. You leave, you die. He'll find you. He'll get inside your head. He'll know everything you know. Find a way to believe in her. [birds singing] [keyboard typing] Who's first? We call him Mr. Bubblegum. Your drone is Mali Saman. She's an artist. Mr. Bubblegum's her agent. He likes showing her off. [whirring] [Alexa] Why are we targeting Bubblegum? [Olivia] Bubblegum is selling Mali's paintings to Adrian. Get close to Adrian. None of that eat-the-rich shit today. All you gotta do is tell him how good your work looks in his house so he can close that deal. Got it? Okay. Take your shoes off. You too. Happy? What do you think? Good right here? Looks like crap there. [handler] Well, where do you want it? Wherever the fuck he's gonna pay the most for it. Show me the hallway. Sure. [person] That's my favorite. Hi. [Alexa] Adrian. [groaning] Towels! [Alexa] Stay calm. He doesn't know who you are. Oof. The towels. [inhales sharply] Oh, I should get someone. No! Uh, Can you just, um, help take them out? Uh, sure. [Alexa] Gun. Glass. [grunts] [gasps] [breathing heavily] And... this one's gonna hurt. Two. [moans] You okay? Mmm. All right. So let's keep the pain away from that mind of yours. [moans] Tell me about that painting. [sighs] I just paint. Uh, toddlers paint. Your painting's a lot more refined. I'm not good at describing it. Well, try. [sighs] "All my life, I dreamed beneath the sea, and I looked upon the surface. Till one day I crashed into the surface and looked upon the sea." It's a line from a book I was reading while I was creating. Can I tell you something? I mistook you for a complete stranger. But we have a lot more in common than I thought. We both know that Web of Humanity is the best book on the planet. [sighs] And that's from a guy who hates love stories. [chuckles] Uh, how is it a love story? How is it not? It's revenge. Pure and simple. Well, for someone who recited so eloquently from what is clearly one of her favorite books... maybe you're missing the poetry of it. "I gazed and gazed until the surface became a reflection. Neither sea nor sky a reflection of itself." Well, I hate poetry. What? Why? You're an artist. You don't know anything about me. Well, tell me about you. I bought that book for someone I love. We were gonna read it together. We never got the chance to. And I'm not sure we ever will. What happened to him? Something I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Well, let's drink to that. Cheers. [gasps] Mali? Mali? Are you okay? You don't look okay. [gasps, breathing heavily] [Alexa] What are you doing? You weren't coming back. I was worried about you. I pulled you back. I was with him! What? Adrian. Put me back in! Now! How did I-- [whirring] You okay? Yeah, I, uh-- I get dizzy spells sometimes. It's-- It's probably the blood. I'm fine. [phone dings] [vibrating] Hey, what's up? Sorry. No, it's fine. [boss] You kill him, his network goes underground, and he loses our tech. I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help? This guy lives in the shadows. He could disappear at any second and be gone for years. Find a way to keep him close. [line clicks] Great. See you tomorrow. [phone beeps] [sighs] [bodyguard] Hey, boss. Oh, uh, my apologies. I-- I have to go. Take care of that foot. Wait! You just bought my entire collection. And I don't sell just to anyone. I'd love to get to know you more or the deal's off. Mmm. I'll send a car at 4:00. [sighs] [gasping] Ow. There you are. When did this happen? Wait, did you let me drink again? [gasping] [Olivia] Alexa, Adrian knows we're on to him. Kill everyone that can help him disappear. [lawyer] I'll find someone to take the blame for you. Trust me, you're not gonna find a better lawyer in this town. Tell those kids not to touch my car. Hey. [both grunt] Sorry. Okay, I gotta go. Hey, wait! I think I lost my key. Would it be underneath your car? [grunts] It's done. I've checked the cameras. Lay low. I'll be in touch. [elevator bell dings] [elevator bell dings] [camera shutter clicking] [Alexa] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. [both grunt] This is not my body. [panting] [both grunting] [grunting continues] This is not my body! [bell tolls] [respirator hisses] [footsteps pacing] [helicopter approaches] [motor revving] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] It's time to see Adrian. You good? [grunts] [mug clatters] [Alexa] This is not my body. ["Reflections (Piece of My Body)" playing] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. [birds chirping] What do you think? I think I still can't believe this is your home. Still much more of a house than a home. Oh, I'd love to see the rest of it. Isn't it beautiful? I'd love to settle down here someday, with the right person, of course. [sighs] [Adrian] I have a Web of Humanity story too. Someone wanted to share it with me. But at the time, I didn't know how to share anything with her. Anyway, one day, I woke up and realized she had no idea who I was. I mean, she had a version of me, but I wasn't that person anymore. So I walked, and of course, the moment I walked, I started to miss her. But I found her again in the book. Saw her on every page. Saw all the reasons why she wanted to share it with me. And I fell in love with her all over again. I see it as a love story. A love story I can never get back. I can relate. I like being here with you. [panting] Are you okay? Uh, too much for a first date? [chuckles] I, um-- I didn't think this was a date. Sorry, I misread it. No, um, I just have to leave. [Olivia] She should be back by now. It's taking too long. [line ringing] [Mali] Hey, you've reached Mali. Leave a message. [sighs] Pull her out. It's not working. Something's wrong. [floorboards creak] She looks tired. Not "she." You. Alexa. Alexa's just a body. Don't! It would break you to feel both at the same time. I don't even know what would happen. He could have followed you here. It's time to go. I can't. I don't know how. I kept hearing my own voice. Seeing my own skin. I kept saying the words, but it didn't-- it didn't work. I couldn't come back, so I... I came back here. Whatever you're feeling right now, use it. Remember who you are. You're here. You see it. Now, find your way back. What would he do... when it got like this? Sebastian? He would go home to you. [boss] It's time to go. You got two hours to come home, or I'll pull the fucking plug. [line ringing] [Mali] Hey, you've reached Mali. Leave a message. [beeps] [gun clicks] [gasps, panting] Let's go for a drive. [sighs] [phone vibrating] [scoffs] [phone beeps] [Mr. Bubblegum] Hello. Hey, did we party last night? No. You said you were staying in. Well, I don't remember anything. [Alexa] Where are you right now? [Sebastian] I don't know. [Alexa] Come back to me. [Sebastian] What if I don't know how? [Alexa] Then I'll have to come find you. What can I get you? Grilled cheese with tomato. Do you know what they call that? A happy waitress? [chuckles] A happy waitress. And for the lady? I'm not hungry. Your husband always ordered lobster. At the diner. Like an amateur. He wasn't an amateur. You just didn't know him. I spent months in the safe house with him. Oh, yeah? So why did he order lobster then? We were in Baghdad. We got pinned down in this bombed-out apartment, and I was shaking in my boots, and he was calm, talking about... [sighs] ..."If we had to go out to dinner tonight... where would you wanna go? What would you wanna eat?" And I just said, "Lobster." And that was it. For the rest of our lives, he was always, "Someday, I'm gonna take you out for lobster." Why someday? Because he was allergic to shellfish. Said he had to work up tolerance. Amateur. And he always fights for me. For us. And that's why this is really hard, because I just feel like he's... gone. Keep that connection. These other bodies, these other lives, it's just noise. Tune it out. You'll make it. Need the bathroom. A happy waitress, sunshine. [sighs] [agent] Hey, I've been looking all over for you. Grilled cheese and tomato. A happy waitress. I'm happy, Mr. Valmora. Are you happy too? [sighs] [agent] You enjoying the weather? Get any bug bites lately? It's so nice to see you again. You're dead, you son of a bitch. Only if you find me first. [patrons gasp, scream] Adrian got him. Got me too. He's gonna use me now to kill you. You finish this. I can already feel him in my head. Come on! You've always wanted this. I'd do it. [gasps] [gasps] How do I know you're you? You don't. Well, they're both dead, and I'm going home. You go home, Adrian wins. Someone, some day, is gonna put a knife in your throat, and you're never gonna see him coming. [screams] [gasping] [switch clicks] [cries] Hey, hey, hey, hey. [panting, cries] Alexa, tomorrow, you see Adrian. Tomorrow, you finish this. Okay. [panting] Come back to me. Please. I'm gonna do something really hard now, but... I need you to hold me. Who are you? I'm-- Get out! Oh, Hi, Mali. Was he expecting you? [grunts, coughing] [water lapping] What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. It's not a good time. What happened? Leave me alone! What if I don't wanna leave you alone? Look, talk to me. Just tell me where you are. I ran into an old friend. Didn't go so well. Me too. What do you need right now? If you want me to leave, I can leave, but I was hoping I could stay. Sometimes, the only thing that makes sense... the only thing that makes me feel like me is... touch. [Olivia] First, find the spider, then you can kill him. [Alexa, distorted] This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. This is not my body. What happened? I don't remember. Why am I here? I pulled you out when you lost consciousness. Here. I don't need this. You should change out of your wet suit. What are you talking about? What the fuck? I didn't wanna get you undressed. Who am I right now? Who is standing in front of you? Alexa. Oh, God. What happened in there? Just tell me and we'll fix it. You can't fix it! I can try. Just come back. I'm still her! [panting] Who sent you? Where the fuck am I? [cries] [grunts] [screaming] [screams, grunts] What is it? Make it stop! Please make it stop! [screams] [screams, grunts] What is it? He disconnected me. He disconnected me. Fuck. What the fuck happened in there? I found the tech. I found Sebastian's spider! Fuck. I'm calling the wet team. He'll be dead in half hour. Listen, Mali is in there. I can't let him kill her! What the fuck? I'm gonna finish this. [Mali grunts, panting] Let me go! Help me! [grunts] [grunts] [groaning] [both grunt] [screams] [grunts] [both grunting] [screams] [body thuds] [cries] [groaning] [screams] [Alexa] This is not my body. This is not my body. [grunting] [Alexa] This is not my body. [gasps] [gasps] [grunts] [gasps] Alexa... I love you. [Sebastian] Alexa! Wait, I don't-- I don't understand. Oh, I missed you. I missed you. [sobs] Hey. Wait, I don't-- I saw you get shot. You saw what I wanted them to see. [softly] Okay. Okay. Why? I couldn't be Sebastian anymore. They broke me, Alexa. Don't you feel broken too? [Sebastian] They could turn off the machine, but they couldn't disconnect me. All the other lives rattling around in my head. Like a fire in my brain. And the only way to put it out was to stop being me. If I could disappear, if I could start over as someone new... I could be free. I was never shot. I was already Adrian. I was finally free. But they were never gonna stop looking for me. I had to take them out... so that we could be free. You must have felt that too, when you were Mali. Right? You-- You-- You left me alone. [sighs] You almost fucking killed me! I killed for you! And you've been running around as Adrian, chasing another woman! I was grooming her for you, so she could be your host! So we could take the tech and disappear! I don't want that. Nobody could come looking for us. We can go wherever you wanna be. Be whoever you wanna be! I want to be Alexa! I want you to be Sebastian! Don't call me that! Alexa and Sebastian are just bodies. Yeah, but it's not-- We can be so much more! That's not us! That's the whole point. [door opens] No, no. No! Hey! Hey, hey, hey. No! They used me. [Alexa] Don't do this. I did all the dirty work... Don't do this! ...and they got to walk away clean! Don't do this! Hey! So we're gonna walk away clean, and you're gonna be the one that's gonna suffer. Please, don't do this! Don't do this, please! Sebastian! Sebastian is gone! [gunshot] [casing clatters on floor] [no audio] [Sebastian] "I promise you, I'll never die, unless I'm looking in your eyes." Been months. How are you holding up? I, uh... I don't know. I'm-- I'm fine. It's normal to have feelings. You were her and now you're-- you're just you again. Anyway, you hadn't checked in, so I-- I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm okay. She's gone missing. You haven't seen her, have you? No. Not a sight. [cooing, giggling] You hungry? Hello, we all good in here? I am drowning in here. Can you take over? Of course. No, I mean take over. I got you. [breathes deeply] [exhales] [sighs] [inhales sharply] [baby cooing] You have a beautiful family. Me. Your auntie. And one day, I'll tell you all about... your father.
