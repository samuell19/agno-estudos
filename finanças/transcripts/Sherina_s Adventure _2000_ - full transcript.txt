Go on! You're almost there! Can you really do it? -Come on, Sherina! Bring the birds down! -Come on, Sherina! Let us see the birds! -Come on, Sherina. I want to see it! -Sherina, let us see it! OK, count... One... two... three! -You tricked us! -Sherina! The sun shines brightly As if it is smiling happily Though it shines fiercely We're still happy -The leaves are swaying cheerfully -The leaves -Along with my step -Along Running after one another freely With dearest friends -How -How happy it is -To have lots of friends -To have lots of friends, it's so much fun -How happy it is -How Enjoying the day together Phone call for you, sir! Yes, I'm finished working. Yes, I'm going home right now. I'll be there before Sherina gets home. -How -How happy it is -To have lots of friends -To have lots of friends, it's so much fun -How -How happy it is Enjoying the day together Here comes the train! -How -How happy it is -To have lots of friends -To have lots of friends, it's so much fun -How -How happy it is To be grateful for His blessings Come here! -What's that? -Look at them! It's cute! Aren't they cute? -I'm going home, OK? -OK. Bye! -Mom! -Yes! Is Dad home? He is. He's got good news for you! You're stinky. Better to be stinky than a crybaby! Dad! Dad? Hey, my little daughter is home! Are you tired, dear? Dad, what's the good news? What's all this? Adhesive bandages on your arms, and on your knees! Let me take them off! -Ouch! -What is it? That one was real! It's your fault for putting them on as a hobby. How would I know if you're really injured or not? Well, leave them like that. So I look tough. So, Dad, what's the good news? -Sherina, go change first. -That's right. -Oh, Mom! -Go on. OK, I'm ready! OK, Sherina... You know that I don't really like my current job, right? -I know. -Do you know why? Because you studied agriculture, but you work in a supermarket. So, you know what my real dream is? To run a huge plantation. Well, my dream is about to come true. Where are you going to build the plantation? Not build, I'll run an already-existing plantation. It belongs to a successful businessman in North Bandung. Bandung? That's right, Bandung. It's not in Jakarta? Where can you grow plants in Jakarta? Where? So, you're going to go back and forth between Jakarta and Bandung every day? Not back and forth, but... we all are moving to Bandung. Sherina? Sher? Sherina! Sherina? DR. SETIA BUDI STREET My heart is weeping, my heart is breaking I don't really want to say goodbye My heart is wondering My heart is uncertain Would I find Happiness like what I have here? Friends who are always there In happiness and sorrow Friends who are always there? In happiness and sorrow A comfortable place When I open my eyes From a deep sleep? Don't be sad Don't be wary Don't jump to conclusions Don't be restless Don't be wary Take a closer look So you can see it More sensibly Why do the stars shine? Why do the rivers flow? Why does the world spin around? Take a closer look And you Will understand Why do the stars shine? Why do the rivers flow? Why does the world spin around? Take a closer look And you Will understand -Sher, look. -It looks so fresh! -Look outside! -It's different, right? -Right. -You won't regret it, Sher! -What's that on your right? -Take a look, Sher! -Just look at those tall trees! -Yes, that's right. -Right? -Yes. Look, Sher. There no such view in Jakarta! What if we put it up there? -That's a great idea. -Why didn't we think of it before? Hush. Sadam's here. Please, don't... What were you blabbering about yesterday? Answer me! That... Answer me! Icang... Good morning, class! Good morning, ma'am! Who put Faris there? Dudung, do you know who put Faris there? Icang, ma'am! Icang, is it true you put him there? He climbed there by himself, ma'am. Boo... Shush. Icang, come here. Get a chair and help him get down, now! Faris, come here! Class, today there's a new student from Jakarta. I want Faris to meet her on behalf of the rest of you, and the rest of you can meet her during...? Recess! Right? One moment. Sherina! Faris, this is Sherina. Please shake hands. -My name is Sherina. -I'm Faris. Sherina. Now, write down your full name on the board. Can you do it? -Yes. -Go on. Good. What's her name, class? Sherina M. Darmawan. Very good. Sherina M. Darmawan, right? What does the "M" stand for? Monkey! Aren't you going to the canteen? No, I'll stay here. Are you afraid of Sadam? Not really. Sherina, can we become acquainted? We just did. But we don't know yet that "M" stands for. What does it stand for? Melodi. Funny, isn't it, how they named you? Doesn't "Melodi" mean song? It's because my mother is a songwriter. So, you like singing? Yes. There's a monkey looking for a banana! Ignore him, Sher. He's like that. If you confront him, he'll get worse. Once he put a frog inside my bag. Once I had to go home at nine in the morning to change shorts because Sadam smeared ketchup on my chair. That's the third time he's put me on the top of the cupboard. Nobody dares to face him? Sadam is very cruel. How can anybody dare to face them? I think a person like him shouldn't be confronted. You don't want to be his enemy, or he'll bully you all the time. So, we'd better be friends with him even though he is nasty? Is that it? If you were me, what would you do to him? Fight him. Fight him? You dare fight them? If we're right, we shouldn't be afraid! Hey, you big bully! You're only brave enough to bully small kids. Especially girls! You ugly boy! How dare you! That means she has a crush on you, Dam! I'll bet she'll call you in a moment. Hey, coward! Come here if you dare! See, I told you! Go on, go to her! Come on. Don't, Sher... Sherin... What's the matter? Chicken? I'm not scared! Are you going to apologize for calling me "monkey"? Why should I? I wasn't talking to you when I said that. -Monkey! -No, she'll come here! Monkey! He thinks, he's a hotshot The greatest and the mightiest He's great Like a rooster! Cock-a-doodle-do! He's great! But easily defeated by a girl! -Sadam, she's making fun of you! -Shut up! She thinks she's the best The smartest and the mightiest She's smart! Smart at telling lies! She's strong! She has a real strong appetite for food! A hero should stand up for the weak A hero doesn't usually wear a skirt! A hero must be willing to sacrifice A hero doesn't fabricate wounds! -Yeah! Losers! -Let's go. Mom, how come someone can be such a brat? Oh, still thinking about your new friend, aren't you? What's his name again? Sadam? Is naughtiness some kind of hereditary disease? Oh, no. Are Sadam's parents naughty, too? Well, maybe. If you don't know, how you can say it's hereditary? It's just that like, for instance, when someone says, "Sherina, you're so kind," then you'll say, "She got it from me." If kindness can be inherited, then naughtiness can be, too. You... If it isn't hereditary... then it must have been carried from infancy? You know that babies are born innocent, so it's impossible such thing as naughtiness is carried from infancy. It's a curse, then? Hush, where'd you get such idea? Then what is it? How would I know? I haven't met Sadam. You don't need to, Mom. His face is really annoying! It's bad luck to meet a kid like him. If so, don't expect you'll find out why he's like that. Why? Because you need to get to know him better first before you'll be able to find out why he is like that, Sher. Let's go in! -Good morning, everybody. -Good morning, ma'am. All of you must have read the notice, right? We're having a three-day holiday. Yay! Hey. Listen. But, by next Wednesday, you'll need to submit an essay to me about your holiday experience. -Boo! -Hey, hang on a second. Shush, my god. -What's the matter, Sherina? -It's sticky... What's sticky? -Don't wash it, Mom! -Why not? When I find the culprit, I'll make him wash it. Wash what? Don't just intrude, Dad. I'm pissed. I see. OK, what if... If we all stay over at Mr. Ardiwilaga's villa, would you still be upset? What's so special about the place? Lots of things. There is a vast plantation. There are hills and a lake nearby. There is a forest. You can go hiking there. But, it's all up to you. The point is, Mr. Ardiwilaga has invited us to stay over at his place tomorrow until the day after. Do you want to come? Yes! Yes! Yay! Yay! This one? Put it over there. -Good morning, Mrs. Ardiwilaga. -Mrs. Natasya, so early? I'm going to Jakarta. When I passed your house, I thought of dropping by. Please, come inside. Before I go back to Jakarta, I'd like to offer once again to... Perhaps you'd sell this plantation to me? Mrs. Natasya, if we sell this plantation how will we make a living? Tomorrow morning, please report to Mr. Darmawan. -Yes, thank you, sir. Good morning. -Yes, good morning. Your savings from the selling of the plantation will be enough to live on. You told me yourself that your husband is having difficulties with the plantation. Let me take care of it. Managing this plantation will cost you a fortune. Mrs. Natasya, the plantation was inherited from my husband's family. Whatever the problems are, he will take care them by himself. Also, the people around here depend on this plantation. Dear, we have a guest. -Good morning. -Morning. Good morning. Are you going out, sir? No, I'm expecting someone. An engineer from IPB. He spent one year in Japan, and now he's helping me at the plantation. Oh, right. Yes... Just like I've told you before, I'll always improve the quality of my plantation. Honey, Mrs. Natasya means well. She thinks that we're going to sell the plantation to Kertarajasa's conglomerate, for his Pasundan Valley Project. She thinks instead of it falling into the hands of a person whose intent is to ruin this plantation, it'd better if she bought it herself. I only want to fulfill my grandfather's dream, which is to run a plantation. Endang! The guests have arrived! Please excuse me. -Good morning. -How are you? Morning. Thank you so much. See you again, Mrs. Natasya. -Thank you. -Thank you. Sherina! Don't stare people like that. Why's that, Mom? -It's impolite. -Who's she? I don't know. -Come on! -Wait a moment, Mom! Good morning. -Come here. -Good morning! This must be Sherina! Thank you for the invitation, ma'am. Sherina is very happy to be here. We're the ones who are happy having people over here during the holiday. Come here. -Say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Ardiwilaga. -Say hi. -Please, come. -Come inside. Our first daughter has already married and moved to Batam with her husband. The second one has just finished her study in the US, got a job there, and doesn't want to return here. The third one is still in college in Jakarta. A boy or girl? We have four children. The oldest three are all girls. We thought three were enough, but my husband wanted a son. Eleven years after the birth of our third daughter, we were finally granted a boy. Where does he live now? With us, here. Iyah! Where's Sweetie? In his room, ma'am. Tell him to come down. We are having guests. Sweetie! Your mom is calling! He's a bit shy when meeting people for the first time. -One second. -Right. Sweetie! -Is he like that in school? -Who? He said the two of you are classmates. Really? Sweetie? Sweetie who? -I don't want to! -Don't be like that! Come on, Sweetie! Come, meet Mr. and Mrs. Darmawan, Sherina's parents. Go on. Sweetie? You said you wanted to play together? Why don't you? Sweetie, go play with Sherina. OK? Hey, get over yourself. I'm doing this because my mom told me to. Don't think for a moment I'm making up with you. Who wants to make up? Get over yourself! -Mr. Buan. -Yes, sir? Is the cement on the drainage dried yet? If it isn't raining, we'll probably be able to use it by tomorrow afternoon. -Good. Thank you Mr. Buan. -Yes. Any time. Mr. Darmawan, do you think the damage of my plantation is serious? After I examined what's going on here, Mr. Ardi, it seems the damage has been caused by someone. Wait a minute, are you telling me that someone is trying to destroy my plantation? Oh my God. From what I've studied, what has been happening during the last four months is very odd. Just like what's happening in the area over there, sir. The plants in that part should have borne fruit. But in less than a week, they withered. This is so sudden, sir. It's strange. Then hundreds of rats appeared in sector B. I think it's odd, because from what I've found from looking into the background of your plantation, there have never been any rats in this plantation. Not to mention the destruction of some plants who were yanked out from the ground by the roots. Who would be that cruel to me? I seek forgiveness from Allah. -Excuse me, sir. -What is it? The goods are ready to be delivered to Jakarta. Yes? Hello, Mr. Raden! Report in, please. Tomorrow morning, we'll make our move. Hopefully, we don't have to break into the house. From what I've observed, the kid's having a guest, a girl his age. So, if tomorrow morning they come out and play again like today, it'll make our job easier. Yes. Wow, don't worry, sir. Hey, poseur! If you dare, I challenge you to have a race with me! I wouldn't want to do such silly thing. Only little kids do that! So, what do you want? If you dare, tomorrow morning we'll race to get there! Over there! There's also one with kinca sauce... -Kinca sauce? -Kinca. -Kinca is made of melted brown sugar. -Oh, brown sugar. Go ahead. Bi Iyah, please give this to Sadam. Tell him it's from me. It's still warm. Yes, sir. What's the special food from this area, sir? Besides this, there is also peyeum... Excuse me, ma'am. Sweetie, this is a fresh baked cake from daddy. Eat up. Where are you going? Going camping? There's nothing wrong with being prepared, right? Bosscha is near. It only takes half an hour hiking. What's the use of bringing such things? Sweetie! Listen! Stay close to Mr. Endang! You should always be close to Mr. Endang. If you want anything, ask Mr. Endang. You shouldn't buy food. If by noon you're still there, have lunch first before you go home. OK? The food is ready to be served by Mr. Endang. Understand? No way! I don't want Mr. Endang to come along! I don't want to bring things! Bosscha is so far away, Sweetie. I'm worried if you get ill. What if you catch flu? What if your asthma acts up? I don't want Mr. Endang to come along! All right then. It's OK if Mr. Endang doesn't come along. But... you shouldn't go as far as Bosscha. It's too far. Going around the plantation is far enough, OK? Stop! Now I'm in front! Hey, Mommy's boy! Spoiled brat! -Look after me. -Hey, watch it! -Mommy's little boy. -No way! Why are you pouting? Sweetie, are you tired? Thirsty? Or hungry? Say that again and you're dead meat! Oh, no, Sweetie is so fierce! Listen friends, I have a story About a boy who thinks he's gutsy Do you know, friends Who would have thought That the hotshot is a mommy's boy A really spoiled kid Hey, wait, Dam! Why are you angry? INDEPENDENT CITY Who would have thought? At school He's a hotshot Who would have thought? At school He's a bad tempered boy But at home, he's taken care by his mommy Do you know, friends, I begin to wonder Who knew that when going to bed He's still tucked in By his daddy and mommy! Hey, wait for me, Dam! Hey, Dam, how old is that tree? I don't know. Sweetie can't catch it up! Mommy's boy! Slow-poke! Where are you going, missy? Slow-poke! Annoying little brat! Sadam! Sadam? Oh, that's what you do when you sulk! Being cruel! Running away! So that when you cry I won't know. Sadam! Sadam? OK. You think I can't go home by myself? Sadam! Oh, no. Sadam! Am I lost? Yes. Where are those kids? It's this late, and they still haven't arrived. Go call Mr. Buan. Tell him to look for them. Want something to eat? Here. Come here. I have food. There you are. I've been looking for you. Who are you? My name's Mastur. I'm Mr. Ardiwilaga's employee. Sadam's dad. I was sent by Sadam to find you. Come along! Where's Sadam? At my home. He's taking a break. My place is up there. Over there. Come. Sadam can't come, he's ill. Come on. Why is he taking her? Come here, pretty girl. OK? -Come on. -Who's that? -My friends. -What? Where is your house? Sherina! Run! Watch out, snake! -She's escaping, sir! -Go get her! -Get her, quick! -Hey! What's the matter, sir? Chase after her! -Now, sir? -Now. Hurry! Mastur, you idiot! She's not here, boss. It's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Not here. Hey! Where's that girl? We lost her, sir. -Where is that girl? -We couldn't find her, sir! Idiots! All of you! Don't you realize that if she escaped, it will ruin the whole plan! Understand? Do you still want to be rich or not? -Yes, sir. -Yes. In that case, we'll go until we find her. -That's right. -Yes. That's right, look for her once again. Even better, ask the police. That's right! That's even dumber! We have to get out of here as soon as possible. Before the kid go to the police! You fool! Stupid! What an idiot! Why did you bring her along to our place anyway? My order was clear. Find her then finish her. Idiot! Came walking in just like that... I was about to finish her. But when I looked closer at her, I didn't have the heart. Rubbish! That's why I took her to you, so you could do it. What did you say? Like I can do that? Sadam! -Sweetie! -Sherina! Sadam! -We'll go up. Let's go further! -Yes. Let's go. How come they came this far? They didn't go this way. Do you copy, Central? Please go on, Central's here! We found something, sir! There's a silver-blue drinking bottle, and nearby, there's tracks left by car wheels at place where it isn't common for a car to pass by. It's Sadam's. Hello. May I speak to Mr. Ardiwilaga? He's not in. Who's this? Who am I talking to? I'm his wife. Oh, that's fine. I just want to let you know that your son is in a good condition. But if you refuse to cooperate with us, he might not end up as healthy. Who's this? What do you want? Please tell your husband to prepare a ransom of three billion rupiahs in exchange for his son. Make sure I receive the money by tomorrow afternoon. I will tell you the exact place and time later. Oh my God, three billion? It's only three billion. One more thing, ma'am. In these modern days, wherever we are, we can see every step you take. So, don't even try to call the police. I hope they're stupid enough to believe we do have the sophisticated equipment. It was his fault! Because you screamed, your friend escaped. It's a mess! It seems that he doesn't know who we are yet. Let's seal his mouth so he can't speak. What a mess! Now what? Don't let him escape! -Hurry up! -Now? -Ouch. -Be quiet! His foot stinks. What did he step in? It's not his foot, it's his body! I'm against any actions that endanger our son! I know! But if we don't go to the police, can you guarantee that Sadam and Sherina will be safe? Believing the criminals in the first place is wrong. They strongly forbade us from calling the police! Any kidnapper would tell us not to tell the police! Of course they forbade it! If they found out that we called the police, and something terrible happens to our son, are you ready for a lifetime of regret? So, what should we do? I don't know! But we should get the money to pay the ransom. The ransom is three billion! Where on earth could we find the money? You do know that our plantation has not produced anything for almost a year? Three billion is a lot of money. If we put it into bags, how many bags will we need? Oh, God, please protect Sherina... My turn? The royals first! -It's the joker for me. -Idiot! You throw away the joker! -Quit laughing. Now... -Take this, sir. -Of course! Cooperation! -Cooperation! Don't say anything. Finish it, show your hands! -You... Oh my God. -Come on. Come on, spread it. Tur, it's your turn. -My turn? -Yes. -Hey, where's that two at? -I don't know, haven't seen it. Who's guarding the boy? -Me, sir! Me. -Us. You want money, but you won't work for it! -What's the matter? -I don't know. Work! Still want to be rich or not? -Off course, sir. -Idiot. Then work for it! Stand guard! -Idiots. -Now? Yes! Right now! Stand guard! Both of you are absent all the time. Sleep! Now, it's your turn! I want to sleep! -No way! Me first! -Hey. -I found that pillow! -But I'm the oppressed one! -Just like the people! -Oppressed? How am I supposed to sleep then? Half for you and half for me. What are you doing? -Give it to me! -Hey! You should be ashamed, doing that in front of the kid! Maintain our honor. We're mafia. A lace, a string, we mafia stick together. You're right. We sleep and we work. -Now, sleep first. Together. -Oh my God. Ouch. -Tonight I'm all alone -Look at this. My babe, I cannot sleep without seeing her first. -A hot lady. -Hey, who's this? Hey, that's my babe! What's all this noise? What's that? Give it to me! -Whose picture is this? -I found that in the drawer. You're being silly! Don't you know who she is? She's not Neneng Asoy? Neneng Asoy? If the big boss finds out, you're doomed. She's the wife-to-be. -Let me keep it. -No fun. Idiots! -Stupid! -He took it just like that. It's not bad. My private collection has been confiscated. Wouldn't it be better if we go to the police secretly? We can't. We all have to agree on something first. But we'd go to the police to find Sherina, not to release Sadam. Let Sadam be released in the way his father wishes if they don't want to deal with the police. If she had gone on her own, it wouldn't be a problem. But she went with Sadam. Now that Sadam's kidnapped and Sherina is missing, too, logically they must be together. I have an idea. What are you doing? Asking for help from Mrs. Natasya. What kind of help? You heard it yourself that she wanted to buy our plantation, right? She also said she had two billion in cash if we wanted to sell it. Wait a minute. Selling our plantation shouldn't be decided hurriedly. It's for the sake of our son! The plantation is our most precious possession. We should keep it for the sake of our children, too. We need lots of money! The money from Mrs. Natasya plus our savings and deposits... And maybe we can borrow from people. I'm sure we can get three billion. This is for our son. The important thing is that our plantation doesn't fall into the hands of a person like Kertarajasa, whose intention is to ruin our plantation. Am I right? Mrs. Natasya? Upay! Upay? Upay! Sorry, sir! I served the ginger coffee late. Who asked for it? I thought... Hey! Why are you taking it back? What? I thought... "I thought"! You always think a lot, but you're always wrong. All I asked was, "Who asked for ginger coffee?" You did, sir! If I did, why are you taking it back? I thought... Again? -Just leave! -Yes. Where are you going? You don't know what I called you for. What is it, sir? Is it true you come from Lembang? I am, sir. But I don't live there anymore. The whole village has been sold to you, sir. For this project. Good. You're OK with it, right? Well, since it's your decision, what else can we do? I'm asking, are you OK with it or not? Yes, sir. I'm OK with it. Really. Do you know Ardiwilaga? Ardiwilaga the owner of the plantation, sir? Everybody knows him, sir. He's a good man. What did you say? Did you say that he's a good man? A very good man, sir! He's generous. He hires people from my village, sir. Because that Ardiwilaga doesn't want to sell his plantation to me, this project has been postponed. Do you know the consequences are? I've spent lots of money, but don't know when I'll get any profit. We might go bankrupt. As a result, you'll have to go home and become a beggar because you're homeless. Now, can you still say that Ardiwilaga is a good man? No, he isn't... -Say it again! -No. -Say it again! -No, really. He isn't a good person... Why are you sitting there? Get up. Who is it? Natasya? How is it? Ardiwilaga has just called me. Oh, really? She told me about her son being kidnapped, and they need money to pay the ransom. And they finally agreed to sell the plantation to me... To us. OK! We'll prepare a press conference, so that everyone knows that Kertarajasa will launch the project! My name is Kertarajasa I'm like a king Whatever I want I will get I'm extraordinary I'm incomparable Everybody obeys me I've conquered everybody Don't even try To oppose or disobey me I'm not a generous person Don't even try To oppose or disobey me Beware of the risks My name is Kertarajasa I'm incomparable I'm the most powerful Everybody obeys me Everybody obeys me Me first. We must look for help, quick. I know that. But where to? There isn't a house nearby. Besides at this hour, everyone's asleep. What do we do? I know who still works at this hour. The place shouldn't be far from here. We were going to that place this morning, now we really should go there. Where? At the Bosscha star observatory. Yes? Really? When? Yes, I'm coming home now. PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR Ndro. Hey! What? -My wife's in labor. -Whe... -When? -Right now. -I have to go home now. -Right. -I'll take care of it. -Thanks. -Man? -Yes? -Congratulations! -Thanks, Dro. Come on, Sher! Gosh! It's open! What are you looking for? It's... My chocolate! You haven't eaten, have you? My God, the bag is slit open. Leave it be. Come on. PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR There's got to be someone's inside. What would a person do here at this hour? How could they observe the stars in the daytime? Why is it so quiet? You don't have to observe stars in a crowd. Alone is fine. So, this is how it looks from the inside? The person who works is out. How do you know there is one? If there wasn't, the dome wouldn't be closed. All the lights would've been off and the machine wouldn't have been active. What machine? The machine to move that telescope. If you observe a star, the telescope will follow the movement of the star. How do you know so much about this? When I'm sad, I like to sit outside and gaze at the stars. Usually I feel better afterwards. That's why I want to know so much about the stars. Wow! That's star is so bright! It's not a star, it's a planet. What is the difference between a star and a planet? A star is like a sun, it has its own light. But planet is like the Earth. It's bright because it reflects the sunlight. If it's a reflection, then why does it shine brighter than the others? Because its location is near to Earth. It's called planet Venus. That one is Mercury. There are, in fact, others which are brighter, but since they're further away, they only twinkle. Their names are beautiful. They are Canopus, Capella, Vega... Canopus... Capella... Vega... Stars in the sky Hold a million mysteries Twinkling, blinking As if asking us To get to know them better Stars in the sky Hold a million mysteries They form a beautiful shapes Lighting my path At every pitch dark night Stars in the sky Your names are so beautiful Canopus. Capella. Vega. Radiate your light Lighten my path Sadam's gone! Sadam. Sadam! Fool! Moron! Why are you so stupid? Now that the boy's gone, what do we do? The shovel is still here. Escaped! He escaped! He ran. Kiss the money good bye. -Sadam's friend. -Understand! It was his turn, sir! I was sleeping. He didn't say he was running away. Sadam? What's wrong? Mr. Endang! Bi Iyah! Yes, ma'am? Why didn't Sweetie bring these along? Yesterday they were put in his bag. So, he didn't bring his backpack and didn't bring these either? Is that so? He didn't bring his jacket either? Oh my God, he'll get sick! Oh my God. So, don't get sick, OK? What will happen then? Hopefully not. But I'm starting to feel it. Then you must go to the hospital immediately. Wait here, OK? There's one more, sir! Too bad we stepped on the rest. We can still eat them, sir. Eat it, then. -Keep searching. -Let's go. -Now? -Moron! There must be a way. Help! Help! -There's more! -Wow, really? Don't step on it. -We don't want to waste it. -Ouch. They went here. Idiot. What are you looking for, Mr. Raden? Mr. Kayana, Mr. Yaya. -We're searching for a thief. -A thief? We suspect he's hiding inside. Help... Come on, Sadam! We have to run! I can't, Sher. I can help you. We have to leave together. -Shall we open the door? -Sure, the thief's inside. -Open the door. -But, sir... -Come on. -But, sir... Let's go, Dam. I can help you. It will be harder if we go together. Don't worry about me. Run that way and find a market. They know my father. I'm sorry, Sadam. I'm the one who has made many mistakes. I'm sorry, Sher. Mr. Raden asked you to. Open it! The bag, Sadam! -What is that noise? -Noise? Hurry! Yes! -Check the place! -Now, sir? -Go. -Idiot! Hurry! -Hey! -Hey! What's that? You watch yourself! Ouch! -Damn fence! -Ouch. Aha! Boss, we're going to be rich, boss! Where are you hiding? My sixth sense tells me that the kid is here somewhere. That's right. -There she is! -Running away! Go ask someone! We won't know if we don't ask! But if they ask for something in return...We're dead! Excuse me, ma'am? Have you seen a girl this tall? -Mr. Ardiwilaga? -Yes? Don't forget the time and place of the meeting we just arranged. Not at eight. Please. At this age, no one keeps that much money at home. I have to withdraw it at the bank. The bank opens at eight. OK, 8:15, then. What's so difficult about that? Don't be absurd, sir! If that's how you deal, even if you kidnapped five kids, you wouldn't get a thing. Half past eight. By the way, I heard there's a she demon around here. She demon! Why? What's wrong? Whose kid is this? Who are you? I'm Sherina, Sadam's friend. We were kidnapped yesterday. -Kidnapping? -Kidnapping? That's why I have to go to Ar-di-wi-la-ga's house. -Ardiwilaga? -Ardiwilaga? Right, Ardiwilaga! What time will Mrs. Natasya come? Mrs. Natasya, why do these things have to happen? You need to be strong. Right? The most important thing is, you've found a solution to this problem. If you hadn't been here, I wouldn't have known where to turn. It's just a coincidence that I can help. If you were really kidnapped, you shouldn't go home yet. Where should I go? We can count it later, after signing the papers. Excuse me, sir, your land certificate, please. Please sign here, sir. To officially state that you have sold your land and plantation to me, sir. We don't have much time. I never thought it would end this way. Don't think that way, sir. The most important thing is that your son is safe. Thank you, Mrs. Natasya. Thank you. Mommy! Sherina! -Mom! -Sherina! Sherina! Sher, are you all right? -Where's Sadam? -Sadam? We were kidnapped yesterday! Sadam is still in Bosscha because of a person by the name of Kertarajasa. Here. Read this! You made a deal with Kertarajasa? Mrs. Natasya? The boy is here with me. He's fine. In a moment, Mr. Ardiwilaga and his wife will come to pick up Sadam. Oh, yes, have they got the money? Yes. Just give Sadam back to his parents. But, ma'am, the girl has escaped. It's OK. The important thing is that the deal is done. Your payment will also be given. Yes, that's the most important thing. Yes, thank you. Sweetie? Yes, just one minute. Have patience. Just please wait one minute. Yes. -Is this project profitable? -Just one minute. What will happen to the local plantations surrounding the project? What about the environmental issues? Be patient. Listen. -Is this project profitable? -Here's the thing. Yes. Basically, we are consistent with the renewal mission and life development quality which has always been the essence of all the projects that we're run. As this is also be accomplished in the Millennium Pasundan Valley, which is about to be launched in the near future. Mr. Kertarajasa, I have a warrant for your arrest. This is a misunderstanding. We are ordered to arrest you. This is the warrant. Wait! You must be mistaken! I'm Kertarajasa! -This is slander! Wait! -What's wrong, sir? -We were just talking about you. -Bless you, Sherina. -Have a seat, Sherina. -Go on. Sadam, Sherina's here to see you. -Hello, Dam! -Hello. Want to know how to handle stress? You have to pay your debt. Apologize to the kids you've hurt. Oh, that. I'm sorry, Sher. There's one more thing. Please open this. Washing a skirt once in your lifetime wouldn't hurt, right, Dam? Sherina! Class, I've read your essays that you wrote last week. But I have one question for Sherina... and Sadam. Why do your essays have the same story? We went on vacation together. Wait a minute. So, Sherina has made up with you, Sadam? Yes, ma'am. Have you apologized to the others? No, I haven't... Icang, Dudung, you do want to apologize to the others, don't you? -Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am. What do you think? Would you accept Sadam, Icang and Dudung's apologies? Yes, we would. Good, I'm glad to hear that! And later, while I correct your compositions, you all can walk around and apologize to each other. You can start now.
