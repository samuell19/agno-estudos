The Longest Night You know... I really love teaching. Nowadays, it’s the least I do. Everything has become so bureaucratic. - Hello darling. - Hello baby, how are you? - Fine. - Come in, darling. I have to go. Do you want to take a shower with me, teacher? Okay. She’s a good woman, but... I got bored. I understand. I’ve had a happy marriage. Can’t complain. But now, I feel nothing for her. Nothing. Are you alright? Do you want to try again? Come. Come here. Give me your hand. Mom, I’ve been calling you for days and you never answer. There’s been an earthquake here; you didn’t know that, did you? I need to talk to Clara, please. I’m worried, just answer the phone. Thanks, mom. Hey. And your mom? Where is she? I don’t know. Come with me... ...let’s go find her. We’ll take care of you and look for your mom. Good evening, folks. We’re covering the events... ...in the province of Manabi and Esmeraldas... ...affected by the devastating earthquake this weekend. 587 deaths. We continue to support the victims with our donations... ...and our hard work. Our reporters are... ...in different parts of the affected area. Last week I went to the earthquake zone with the Pediatric Squad. I’m really worried about those kids. I never thought it’d be so difficult for you. Me neither. I thought I’d seen everything, that I was prepared for this, but it’s worse than you can imagine. I must go back tomorrow. Let’s see, tell me, what gets you relaxed? It’s important to relax. What gets me relaxed? This helps. You relax me. You do. What about you? What about you, Dana? What gets you relaxed? Do I relax you? A little bit? No! I have to go. I have to go. Do you want to take a shower with me, doctor? Coming. Hello? No, I just went out for a moment. What happened? Is she okay? I’ll be right there. We’re still very shocked... ...at the tragedy our country is facing. The number of casualties is increasing after Saturday night’s earthquake. The most recent news... Julian, I’m almost done. Julian? Hello? What do you want? Help! Shut up! Let me go! Nelson doesn’t like what you’re up to. Answer me! Answer me! - Answer me! - Alright! What just happened is your fault, do you understand? I was looking for you... Where were you? Sorry, I was busy. How are you? She hit her head badly. She’ll be fine... ...calm down. I’m calm. It just feels different when it’s your own daughter. Miss Dana, is everything alright? Yes, thank you. This way, please. Hi. Everything’s fine. I’m alright. Is she okay? Which hospital are you in? Is this where my mom came? She’s not here yet... ...but she’ll come soon. It’s a nice house. This way. That one. Where are they taking her? To a house where they’re waiting for her. Why isn’t she wearing shoes? I didn’t have time to buy any. Hi. What’s your name? Lulú. ¿Lulú? Come here. Mrs. Pilar Londoño? Here we are. Be careful. Come here. I’ll help you. We’ve arrived, sweetheart. Let’s go to bed. Come here. Any allergies? No. Are you taking anything for the pain? Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine? Did you see another doctor before coming here? No. Did a doctor give you the prescription? Yes. You know there are less expensive painkillers, right? Here’s your room... ...you’ll like it, you’ll see. -Hi. -Hello. I’m looking for a patient who was admitted this afternoon with head injuries. Head injuries? Yes, she suffered a strong injury to the head. What’s her name? Dana Hernández. -¿Dana Hernández? -I don’t have her files. Doctor, the lady you describe arrived at around 4 PM. Her name’s Pilar Londoño... ...and left about an hour ago. Pilar. Can I have a look at the file, please? Hi, Nelson. I want to apologize... ...I just wanted to tell you... ...that I’ll pay you whatever I owe you. Nelson... ...what happened today wasn’t necessary. Yes. I know. Nelson, I haven’t got the money. Honey... ...I know things aren’t as easy as they once were. Things change. Opportunities disappear. I know. Yes, Nelson. Who is it? I’m looking for Pilar Londoño. Who’s asking? Dana, is that you? It’s me, Julian. What are you doing here? I’m sorry, I... Who gave you my address? I went looking for you at the hospital and now here I am. Here I am? Here I am, Julian? Did I invite you to my house? Did I? I won’t allow this ever again... ...just this time. Can I come in? Come in. Hi. Hi. Sorry for leaving like that... Don’t worry... ...how’s your daughter? She hit her head. Is it serious? No. It could have been worse, but she’s fine. Under observation. - Come in. - Thanks. A sick child is just the worst news. A dead child is the worst news. I never thought I’d see your house. Who did this to you? Pilar. My name’s Dana. It’s okay... ...baby. Make yourself at home. I’m going to put something on, I’m cold. What do you want, Julian? Who hit you? Nobody hits me. I fell. Who’s the girl? My daughter. You have a daughter? I do. She’s beautiful. Is she here? No. She has been living with my mother for the last seven years. Why did you leave her there? I didn’t leave her. I take care of her. She’s ill and her treatment is very expensive. Stay out of the sun, okay? It’ll be fine. I’ll prescribe you something to make it heal better. Thank you, doctor. Do you want a beer? Sure. Cheers! Come on, dance! - I don’t dance. - Sure you do! Come on, come on... ...dance! Do you have to work today? Yes. What about you? Yes. I do. Do you want some salt? Yes. Chili? No, thanks. It’s good. Thanks. Are you in pain? Do you have... ...headaches... ...or back pain? What are you talking about? Are you sick? What? Never mind. You opened the bathroom cabinet, didn’t you? Look... ...if you want to change your life... You’ve come to my house to judge me? No. I’m a doctor. Do you want to help me, doctor? Lend me money. Is that what you want from me? I have a debt. I’m not the idiot you think I am. That’s not the sort of help I want to give you. Isn’t our relationship all about the money? Good day. Call you later. Bye, mom. RESTORATION OF BABY JESUS FIGURINES AND IMAGES Good morning. Good morning. Can you fix me? Sure, come in. Thanks. Where? I’ll prepare it. Thanks. Come in. Your shoes. This is for Nelson. Stand there and turn around. I haven´t seen you in a while. I thought you’d disappeared. Hey! Is it better outside? Let’s go, girls. Quickly! Quickly! Hey, where are you going? Nelson called for me. Go on. Wendy, what’s that girl doing here? - He’s waiting for you. - Let me go! Wendy. Wendy! Hi, Pilar. Help! Come in. Sit down. What’s going on, Pilar? You used to be reliable, always on time... ...what happened? I spent the money on medicine. I warned you. I told you. I tell all the girls... ...to be careful with that. I know it’s not easy. It’s not the job you dreamed about... ...but it’s what you do. And you do it very well. If you... ...get me beaten up I can’t do such a great job. You know why you’re "free"? Because I trust you. I hope you grow... ...so maybe one day... ...you can work with me. Thanks, Nelson. Don’t thank me, darling. I’ve had enough. So tomorrow... ...you bring me my money... ...or I’ll have to get your daughter. No... No, Nelson, please, no. Please, don’t. Please. Go find some dumbass who can lend you money. You know what? Come here. Bend over. More. Turn around. Hey! What? - Calm down. - Easy. - Calm down. - Easy. Let me out! Please, I don’t want to be here anymore. Hi. Is she here? Yes... I think so. Darío Marquez, engineer, it’s a pleasure. The pleasure’s mine, Dana Hernández. My son just graduated. Congratulations, darling. Thanks. Shall we? -Yes. -Is it okay? Come. Sit down. Daddy’s going to watch, okay? Calm down. Let me help you. That’s it. Calm down. Please, let me out! Please, I’m bored! Let me out! Please, you have to let me go! I’m bored! Mister, let me out. Mister! If you don’t shut up I’ll have to hit you... ...and I don’t want to. Do you understand? Do you? Let’s go, girls! Let’s go! Let’s go! Come on girls! Quickly! -Come on, come on, quickly! -Come on! Hey! Let’s go! Why aren’t you coming out? Let’s go. -Quickly! -I’m going. Walk faster. Open your mouth, stick your tongue out. Let’s have a look. Does it hurt? Good. That’s fine. Let’s have a look at your feet. Let’s see... -...are you ticklish? - Yes. Yes? Let’s see. You must be the only girl in the world who doesn’t like pink. Have you found my mom yet? Did you get bored when you were little? No. When I was a boy I had a job. Booth two. Thanks. Mom! Thank God you’ve answered, I was worried. Mom, what is it? Fine. Mom, why haven’t you been answering the phone? Is everything okay, Mom? Mom. Mom, listen, don’t leave her alone for even a minute, okay? Mom! What happened? But the dialysis machine was working, right? No, Mom! What do you mean? Let me speak to her, okay? Mom, I want to speak to my girl. I need to speak to her, Mom! Mommy... Mom... - Good morning. - Good morning, doctor. Wait a moment, please. Here it is. Thanks. Dana? I’ve been thinking about you. How are you? Not so good. What happened? Are you sick? We’re all sick... ...and we’re all going to die today. Dana? Dana! Clara! She’s not going to open the door, but she’s in there. Yes, she uses opiates. Buprenorphine. Listen, make sure you’ve got Naloxone with you, okay? Let’s do it. I’m gonna clear the floor. Let’s turn her over. Yes. Help me. Let’s go! I can’t find her pulse, the heart has stopped. The CPR masks. Come on! Start reanimation. Very good. Let’s go, quickly! Come on, girls! Let’s go! Quickly! Come on, let’s go! Let’s go! I want to be with my daughter. I’ll help you be with her... ...but don’t do this. My daughter is dead. Excuse me, can I speak with you for a moment? Sure. I need some information on the person accompanying the patient. For my medical record. Of course. Can you give me your name, please? Pedro... ...Reyes... ...Campos. Do you want to change your clothes? Sure. Do you live here? Yes, for the last three months. And you still haven’t unpacked? It’s complicated. Thanks. Hello? Little Bug. Yes. I’m on my way. Alright. Bye. Kisses. I’m bored. Don’t get bored. You’ll only be one more day under observation. Hi! Hi. Thank you for staying all night with my Little Bug. You must be exhausted. You didn’t sleep? I’m fine, I was able to sleep. Hi, Mary, I need to speak to you. Kisses to our Little Bug. You can leave whenever you want. I know it’s hard... ...but you must start over. I’m not going to forget my daughter’s death. Or all those years working my ass off for those guys to get rich. In this business men cheat women. They make them fall in love... ...then they kidnap them, and they rape them. If women refuse to become whores, they end up dead. Or their children. Julian, I saw a little girl in that house. I want to get her out of there. A girl? Yes, a girl. She can’t be more than eight years old. Look, if they haven’t sold her yet, they will... ...and they’re going to rape her a thousand times. Are you sure? Wait. You must report it. Report it? And wait how long for them to raid the house? Dana! Dana! Dana! Hi, Nelson. Calm down, Nelson, I can bring you the money today, I’ve got it all. No, not at The Longest Night. I’ll bring it to your house. I have to tell you something. Dana... ...this doesn’t make any sense. Where should I stick it? This is crazy, baby. Show me where. Where! Here. Show me where, on my neck. Here. Here they come. I’m going in. Where’s the house? Down there, at the end. Thanks for the money. Dana! Please don’t do this. I’m going to get that girl out of there. Yes? Hi, it’s Dana, I’ve got something for Nelson. Come in. Hi. - Hi. - This is for Nelson. Turn around. Lots of work? Same as ever. How’ve you been? Same as ever. Thanks. Come in. Thanks. I’ve got the money, yeah. Nobody has laid hands on the little girl. I’ll bring her for you tomorrow. Come in. Yes. Yes. I’ll wait for your call. See you then, thanks. Hi, Nelson. I’ve had enough, Pilar. Nelson... ...calm down. I was getting you the money. You can’t disappear like that, you fucking bitch. I’m sorry, it wasn’t easy. Look, here’s the money. Nelson... ...I want to work with you. I’m tired of being on this side. You said it yourself, I’m getting too old. Please, calm down. I always knew I’d chosen you well, honey. We should celebrate your promotion. Yes. Whisky? Yes, thank you. Can I go to the bathroom, Nelson? Fuck! I want to celebrate my way. Is there anyone here? Is there anyone here? Where’s the girl, Wendy? Where is she? Where? Where? Put the gun down. Come here, sweetheart, come here. You’re staying here. -Take me with you. -Don’t move! Let’s go. Run. Give me your hand. Boss? Don’t move, bitch! Put the fucking gun down! Put the gun down, Pilar! In Ecuador, sexual slavery mainly affects girls and women from the age of 13. Traffickers identify victims whose family, economic and social environment makes them vulnerable. There is more slavery in the world today than at any other time in history: 21 million people.
