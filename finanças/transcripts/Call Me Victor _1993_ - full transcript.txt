Come on, you remember? Let's go. Your arms, more flexible. That's it. MY NAME IS VICTOR Basile, keep your back straight. And open your arms. Very good. But flexible. It should all be flexible. That's it. September 1978 Hello everyone! Dad's flooded the house again? - He fell asleep on the tap. - He has to be doing it on purpose! He does it every time I come here. Are you alone? Where are the others? - Dad went to get the pump. - I won't be staying for lunch. I don't have time. - I've done a leg of lamb! - Sunday lunch, eh? I don't see the attraction. - And Basile? When do you see him? Never! - Fat chance! What does Basile care if I'm here or not? Every time he just sulks and says nothing. - He won't talk to you if he only sees you for five minutes every now and again, poor kid. - Where is he, anyway? Still up there with Rose? Basile! Mum's here! Look. I bought these at the market. Shorts, shirt, aren't they cute? Well? Didn't you hear me coming? - Hello Mum. - Here, look, I bought you some stuff. Show me, turn around. It's his size. It might be a little loose. But at that age— Here, try on the shorts to check. - I don't wear shorts, I wear trousers. - You'll wear what we give you, let me tell you! No one asked my opinion when I was your age. - Oh, you're exaggerating! We always chose together. - What? You're unbelievable! I can count on the fingers of one hand the times you bought me what I wanted. I always got the neighbours' cast-offs. Anyway, are you going to put these on or not? Come on, I don't have time for this. I have to go. - You said you were staying for lunch! - Yes, but I can't. We'll have to do it another time. Basile! - I wish you'd pay a bit more attention to him! You hardly know your own kid. And you bring him shorts like he's six. Basile! Why did you leave? Where are you going with your cart? You might answer me! You think it's easy? I have to work! I'm going to have the apartment soon, you know. There won't be any more problems. I'll take you back with me. Do you hear what I'm telling you? It's not worth the effort of getting an apartment if you don't want to come. Basile? Are you listening to me? I asked you where you're going. - My name's not Basile, my name's Victor. My name's Victor. And I'm going to Lovers' Island. - What are you talking about? That crazy old woman up there, still filling your head with stories! - Rose is not crazy! And Lovers' Island is not a story. But you've never been there because you don't even have a fiancé. 5 francs a ride, 10 francs for three. Roll up, the Snow Star's waiting! Let's ride, guys! Don't get too close to the wagons, thank you. GHOST TRAIN Artists' Entrance Little bastard! You've pulled that stunt a billion times. - Yeah, but it still works every time. - Come on, hide yourself. I'm working! Hurry up, someone's coming. Quick! - Can I do the skeleton? - Do what you want, as long as they don't see you. - Yeah. - I'll put the bear head on. That way they won't see me. - Don't touch that, you'll break your neck! I can't believe it! You trying to get me fired, with your bullshit! You should have seen the boss! I thought she was going to have a stroke. What's a stroke? - A stroke— It's like when you take a picture of someone and he suddenly stops moving, just like that. - Let's see. Give me a Hello. - What are you trying to do to me now? - Nothing, go ahead, you'll see. - You off your head? You had it? I've been looking everywhere for the last 15 minutes. - Yes, I kept it because it's broken. And then I wanted to give Cécile a Hello but I don't dare. - Yeah! In front of girls, it's not so easy, is it! Give it to me! I'll do it to her! You'll see! Be quick, the Snow Star's waiting for you. five francs a ride, ten francs for three. Leaving in two minutes, We're waiting for you! So Cécile, how's it going? -Being honest? I think I'm going crazy from watching this thing spinning. - Have you got a bandage in your first-aid box? - What for? - I cut my hand on the train. - Did you? Show me. Is it bleeding? - No, it's stopped. Look. - Oh very good. Being the monster on the ghost train hasn't made you any smarter. - So what? Don't you think that's funny? - Oh I do. You're a real barrel of laughs, you are. Jokes and tricks, weddings and dinners. Here, it's a present. I'm off! - Don't leave this here! - Basile, let's go! - Come on, don't blame him. He just wanted to play a trick on you. I'll take back the hand, it's mine. It's the hand of the bride who was blown up on the bridge. - Here we go, it's the other one's turn now! I already told you I'm not interested in your ghost stories. - But it is. The bridge over the river. The Resistance fighters blew it up during the war. There was a bride crossing. - Where did you get all that? You don't even know what the Resistance is. - Of course I do! I was a Resistance fighter too! And it was me blew up the bridge. - You, in the Resistance? That's good because I used to be Marie-Antoinette. Maybe we could start a club? - You don't believe me? You're wrong, because it's true! Why aren't you saying anything? Are you angry? - No, I'm not angry. It's her fault, she put me to shame with her "jokes and tricks". - Cécile is incredibly beautiful. Don't you think so? - Forget it. A girl like that isn't for the likes of us. - Why do you say that? You don't know anything about it! - Have you seen her boyfriend, Franck? The big motorbike, the showing off, that's what she's interested in! Me, with my push-bike? I'm nothing. Can you imagine her sitting back there in the trailer? In the rain? Plus— I'm 28, I could have been her father if I'd been advanced for my years. - I'm telling you, age doesn't matter. Just look at the news on TV. All the best girls are with guys older than them. - Yeah, that's because they've got money! What did you think? - It's not just because of that. It's because they have a lot to tell them. So Franck has a motorbike, but they're not riding it all the time. - I can tell you if I were in Franck's place, with Cécile sitting behind me on the motorbike I'd be in a hurry to get home to see her face to face. - Well you don't know anything. Girls like to be told stories. I can tell Cécile lots of stories. I have plenty of memories. As if I was 70 years old. - Stop screwing around. Cécile doesn't care! - We'll see! It's us! It's us, it's us. Hey Dad, dining alone? - You don't think I'm going to sit down and eat with all this smoke? - Still, you might have waited for us. - The lamb couldn't wait. All you had to do was get here on time. - Yuk, that stinks! - You just have to turn off the pump. Put it back on later. Isn't Yvette here? - She didn't stay. Listen, I don't blame her. Spending her Sunday with her feet in water. - You have to make a drama out of everything! It's almost dry! - Of course it is! Just look at the sideboard. Mum's sideboard. Poor Mum! If she had seen that! It hasn't even dried out from the last time. - So I'll buy you another sideboard. Her mother's sideboard, can you imagine? It's only plywood. - Oh, when it comes to getting parrots to talk you know all about that. But feeding them and cleaning the cage? That's another story! Ho Chi Minh! Hang on, where is Ho Chi Minh? - He flew away! Out the window. - How did he manage that? - I told you, he flew out the window! I opened the window and he flew away. - That's bad. Never mind, Dad Your little sparrow'll be back. - Ho Chi Minh isn't a sparrow. We came through half the war together. He was very young when I found him. I hid him in my jacket. He'd eat anything. Even the lining. And shit in my pocket. There's a lot of noise down there. Another storm? - Just Grandpa flooding the house again. He brought in the pump to suck out the water. - Oh I see. But how do they manage to keep flooding the house? That's insane. They'd probably be bored without a storm in their dining room. I must say this blue smoke, floating in the sun, is beautiful. If it weren't for that awful smell of petrol. - Grandma let a parrot escape. Grandpa wasn't happy! It's weird he could fly away. He had a chain on his leg. - But that's good, you see. Emile floods the house and the old parrot flies out of the window. Anyway, where's he supposed to go? That brave Luce. She's always managed to have luck on her side. She has a knack for causing disasters without doing it on purpose. - Have you always had a quarrel with Grandma? - We have a quarrel? I can't remember. It must have been much worse than that. Nowadays, that seems as old as the Hundred Years War to me. I suppose I'll be asked to dance at the Autumn Gala. But I don't think I'm going to accept. All these little provincial galas. - Guess what? I spoke to Cécile this morning. - Ah yes, the beautiful Cécile. Your little fiancée. - Oh, I wish! - Can Cécile at least dance? - Yes, I saw her at the Bastille Day ball. She was dancing with Franck. He's a grown-up. He's 22. He's got a motorbike. They were slow dancing. - I'm talking to you about dancing. I'm not talking about the open-air café. What's that arm doing there? In position. Remember? Let's go. So Cécile does not dance? And what's more, at a ball she snuggles up to a grown-up of 22. More flexible! You should be able to handle that, Basile. Hold your arm up. You have to make her a ballerina, not a motorcyclist. - Why did Victor never take you to Lovers Island? - He didn't have time. Head straight, flexible. But if the legend was true maybe Victor would be by my side today. - Do you have any pictures of yourself when you were a dancer? - Just think about what you're doing. All that is far too stiff. - What about pictures of Victor, with his racing car, don't you have any of those either? - Leave the photos where they are. That's of no interest at all. You're obviously very distracted today. Come on, that's better. Hey Dad, go to bed! TV's finished. Dad, did you hear me? - Yeah— I'll get the truck out. - If you say so! You're dreaming! Go on! It's late. You'd be better off in bed. - You're still here? I'm going to bed. But first I'm going to pour more water into the cellar. - Don't fall asleep on the tap. Haven't you finished the locomotive? - I haven't finished the locomotive yet. That's typical of you. You always want everything finished before it's started. Rose's Journal - Whoever finds this journal should return it unread to: Mlle Rose Packard, c/o M and Mme Colin, 4 Chemin des Vignes, near the station. Today September 17, 1926, Yesterday was my name day. Mum didn't pick me up. Fortunately, I couldn't have put on my white dress because Luce smashed a red plum on my back. She didn't do it on purpose. I'm in love. I was introduced to a racing driver. His name is Victor. June 5, 1943, Mathilde is getting married. I ended up agreeing to be her bridesmaid. There were three of us in a car decorated with white ribbons. Mathilde, her father and me. We were the first on the bridge. Suddenly, a huge blast lifted us off the ground. Then nothing. September 15, 1946, Mme Colin was overwhelmed by my return. She told me about Victor's death, and she gave me a letter he wrote to me. If only she knew what I learned from that letter. But why don't you want to? - Come on, that was only in fun. - It's unbelievable how jealous you can be! - Yeah, well that's it! You can walk to the fair. - I don't need you! Basile, guess what, it's done. I've finished the bridge! - I know where we're going to put it. We're going to put it next to the island, across the river. Look, it was there, like that. - If you say so. - I'm going to tell you something. You know Owl Island, where you go fishing all the time? Well, it used to be called Lovers' Island. The island is magical. When you go there with your fiancée, you stay with her your whole life. - That's not magic, that's a disaster. - No no, it's really good! - You know, when you're a station master, you don't believe in all that nonsense. All that stuff's fine for everyone else. - I believe in it. And I'll go there one day. Hey, that's a new one! Are you following me now? - No way. I'm just walking around. - Are you looking for a bone from the bride? - You didn't believe me yesterday, about the bridge? - I didn't say that. But just because someone tells you there's a bridge over the river, you can't make him believe you were in the resistance. Everyone knows there was a bridge. You just have to ask. - Yes, but still, you didn't know that! - Because no one ever told me about it. My grandfather knew the bridge. I asked him just now. - You don't have to believe me, but one day, I'll go to Owl Island. And I'll bring you proof that it's all true. - For a kid, you're really weird. That the bridge was blown up, fine. That there was a wedding going on at the time, fine. But that it was you who blew it up? No way! You can tell this to your friends if you want. But I'm too old to believe in ghosts. Did you look on the desk? At the photos I found. There's even one of Victor. With his racing car. It's all your fault. I found them in a box. And that one just there is me. - You're so beautiful! - I must have been twenty. You can keep it if you want. - And who's the old gentleman dancing with you? - He's my dance teacher. I had forgotten he was so old. I was very surprised when I found the photo. - He must be dead by now. - Well, you see— When we're old—We just need to call on Death and he comes to get us. And I hope he'll be interested in this old carcass that has to be lifted above its bed with a hoist. - Watch out, we're taking off! - You know what? There aren't many old carcasses that can fly through the air every morning. Thank you. - One day, I'd like you to come with me to the station to see Milos. - Good Lord, what an idea! - You'll see the electric trains. - And the stuffed dog? I can just see people's faces when they see Rose coming. They all think she's been dead since the war. Thanks. They certainly wouldn't recognize me. But I'm sure they haven't forgotten the little dancing girl. Like on the photo. I didn't lose out. It's much better this way. And then there's Luce. She's quite happy that I prefer to stay in my room. At the end of the day, I only exist for you. Who could dream of anything better? There's only one thing I would miss, maybe. Occasionally. That's the mail. I had so many letters. All those admirers who wrote to me declaring their love. But the first thing I always looked for was a letter from my mother. - Did your mother often write to you? - Often—That's not the word. She sent me one postcard of the Eiffel Tower. To tell me she would come and get me on Saint Rose's Day. Every year. On my name day. I'm waiting for her. - I could write you letters too, if you want. - Victor wrote to me every single day. But you should be writing to Cécile. - I'd like to, but I'd look silly. She lives in the house on the hill by the station. Right next door. - You didn't tell me she lived there! That's the dwarf's house. - The dwarf's house? Yes, that hideous dwarf, knee-high to a grasshopper. Everyone said he was bad luck. Seeing him cross the road in front of you was worse than a black cat or three crows. And also the police always coming to arrest him. - Why? Because he was a dwarf? - Of course not. Because he was a thief as well. He stole everything. Anything that came to hand. Franck! Franck! Where have you been? Not working today? You don't want to talk to me? It's stupid. I have something to ask you. Something about a dwarf. - Well go ahead, I'm listening. - No, if it bothers you, it doesn't matter. I was just wondering if your grandfather knew the dwarf. That's all. - What do you want to know? If there was a dwarf in my family? The dwarf was my great-grandfather. Everyone knows, it's no mystery. - And did you know he was bad luck like three black cats and a crow? - What a discovery! Did you find that out on your Owl Island? You think you're smart with your lame revelations? - I knew your great-grandfather, you know. - Of course you did! So did I! He was a dwarf, he was ugly. I even have his picture on the mantelpiece. Happy? You forgot to say he was a thief! You'll just have to ask your grandfather. He can tell you. Go on! Hey old chap, you're looking serious. As if you've just seen your own funeral. Is someone making you miserable? Just as you wish. Great sorrows stay silent. If you have nothing to say, then say nothing. - Bernard wants to go fishing to Owl Island. I'm going with him. - Oh you're talking now. I thought you'd had your tongue cut out. - He told me to ask you if you could lend us your boat on the river. - Now that's a different matter. You don't think I'm going to lend him my boat just like that? What's more, with the current, getting to the island will be hard. There's no engine. You have to row. - Bernard's a grown-up, he knows how to row. And I'll be with him. - Oh well, if you're with him, I've nothing to fear. Go on, tell him to come and see me. I'll give him a chart to avoid the currents. - Unfortunately he can't come right now. He's working on the ghost train. He hides in the dark and scares the girls. - Only Bernard has such ideas. - Where did you find my boat? I thought someone had stolen it. - In its place, upstairs. On your creatures shelf. - Really? - Actually, in all the clutter you'll soon have nowhere to put all your freaks. You'll be challenging the priest with your own cemetery. - So? Haven't you got a stuffed dog in your office? - That's true. I think it was called Whistle. It belonged to the old station master. When I came, I didn't dare throw it away. - And do you know how it died? - No idea. But it's like mummies. You shouldn't touch them. Their spirit might still be inside. - Do you believe that dead people come back to Earth afterwards? - Of course they come back. Everyone comes back. - But what do they do? - Same as you and me, they wait for time to pass. Until they get it all figured out, they'll keep coming back. You're eleven, but you've probably returned a hundred times already. Maybe you were Napoleon or General de Gaulle. Or that bastard Stalin, who knows. - But how do we know? - We don't know. Nobody knows. Even those who say they remember everything, it's not true. Every time someone remembers something, it's always about his life in a castle. No one's ever been a tramp, or a mine worker— or a station master. - What about a racing driver? There, is that okay? - A little to the right. No! I said to the right, not the left! Stop! There. That's it. - You should have said more to the right. We can't see my bike. - You'll just have to move your bike over. Like I said, this is for you. - Is it OK? - Come here, little man. Look, we can watch the whole yard. - Ah of course, if we get attacked we'll see them coming. - He's jealous. - Where did you get the camera? - He stole it. - Hey, you got nothing better to do? It's half past ten, don't you have a job? - Shit! Half past ten! I'm late. Plus it's Sunday, there'll be lots of girls. - I hope for their sake you wash your hands. - Well, a zombie doesn't have to be clean. Anyway, I put on hairy gloves. I'm off, see you later. - Is it half past ten already? - No, it's ten o'clock. But he was annoying me. - Why didn't you install the camera in Rose's room? It could be useful if she falls out of her chair. - I'm not sure Rose up there would appreciate being watched all day. Get me two wire brushes from the drawer there. This is Ho Chi Minh's cage. We're going to clean it out. - And what are you going to put in it? - Ho Chi Minh, when he comes back. And then your grandmother won't be able to say he escaped through the window. - Why don't you ever go and see Rose? - To begin with, I went to see her from time to time. But—Your grandmother didn't like it. So— And also—I didn't know what to say to her. We're not from the same world. She kept telling me her mother was coming back for her. It was me set up the system to get her into bed. This cage is really rotten! - And the door's broken. Look! - What? Oh shit! Don't worry, I'll weld it. - Who used to bring her food? - Your grandmother. She took her tray up to her. It was a rather cold atmosphere. Watch in hand, she never stayed more than two minutes. Here, put this on. Welding can blind you. Turn the cage. Connect earth. But she didn't have a home? - This is her home. Your grandmother's parents adopted her when she was very young. Her mother put her out to nurse. And never came back for her. Then, after the parents' death they both inherited. Fifty-Fifty. Shit! You're distracting me with your questions. No one knows she's there. Everyone thinks she's dead. She never wanted to go out. How'd you expect them to know? On the other hand, I know that Luce hates when we talk about that. I never knew why. And I never dared to ask Rose either. I only know that she was a dancer. And that she had issues. That's all. Did you hear it? The bell! Didn't you hear the bell? - Yes I heard it. -What happened? What's wrong? Don't you feel well? You never break dishes. Shouldn't it make you happy? The bell hasn't rung in how long? - Since Rose came back! Are you looking for someone? No need for such a face. I made a mistake and here I am. - Have you hurt yourself? You should have called me. I would have come. - I'm fine like this. It's almost comfortable. Here, look. The same, but 60 years ago. Lying on a carpet. Could you have a look under the bed, please? There are a couple of photos I'd love to get back. - I've got one, but I can't see any others. - What's it of? - Hang on, I can't see anything under here. It's full of dust. It's a photo of Victor in a bathing costume. - Oh yes. It's in La Baule. I took it myself. Victor is handsome, isn't he? - Just his costume is a bit weird. - Wait, here's the one I wanted to show you. Here, look at this. - Who are they? - That's Luce, and that's Victor with the spade. - That's Grandma there, with the glasses? She's changed a lot. - Yes, but look closely, behind them. Can you see the house? That's your fiancée's house. The house was under construction. So Victor lent a hand with the building. Here we are. Come on out, ladies and gentlemen. Watch out for the rails. Look over there, the lady with the lovely chignon. She'll give you tokens. Are you jobless too? - No, just until we get the power back on. - I 'm waiting for Franck. He's supposed to pick me up at noon. So I don't know what I'm going to do. - Yes. Of course. - Aren't you too hot with all this? - No, it's fine, I'm not too hot. - I'd like you to show me the train one day. Probably not right now, it'll be too dark. Why does that make you laugh? - Nothing. Fuck it. Do you want me to show you the ghost train? - Yes, why? I don't see what's surprising. It must be fun to see how it works. - We can go now, if you want. There's light, it's on batteries. Only the wagons are stopped. I'll let you in by the Artistes' Entrance. The artiste is me. Have you ever shown this to Basile? - Of course, he knows the train by heart. He comes almost every day. - But does he have any friends? I always see him alone. - That's in the family. We like to be quiet. Here, put your foot there. You'll see. Don't press too hard, it's a bit rusty. - Is that all? - Yeah. It's scary when you don't expect it. It's mostly for kids. - Yeah, maybe. But I'd be surprised if that impressed Basile much. The other day with the skeleton hand, I'm sure that was his idea, right? - Here, look. You put your foot there. And I press this. - That's not very impressive. - You're really hard to impress. - You're not going to tell me that people are scared by that? - Of course they are! In the dark, with the speed, they all scream. - It doesn't take much. Did you know there used to be a dwarf in the neighbourhood? - No. Who was that? - I don't know. Basile told me about him the other day. I thought it was you who told him. - Never heard of him. Damn, it always gets stuck. Hold that! - It's weird, he keeps telling me about things that happened before the war. I wonder where he gets all that. Maybe your mother? - I can tell you, my mother isn't the kind to talk a lot. Besides yelling at you when you come in with dirty feet she only opens her mouth to eat. Job done! Better than the drawings. - It's Franck! Sorry, I have to go. Bye then, thank you for the tour. What are you doing here? I looked for you everywhere. - He was showing me the train. It's amazing when you see it from inside. There's so much to it. - Oh yeah? Were you alone with him? - Yes, is that not allowed? Again! You're playing it again! It's been a long time! Isn't your old 78 moth-eaten yet? What is it you believe, old woman? That I'm going to start listening to your violins again? Hear me now! If I don't want to listen to that same old song, I go out! I go out! And I walk! Was it you did that? - Yes it was me. - What a funny idea. - I put them here to stop the trains. They're passengers for goods trains. - And you think they'll stop for your salads? - I'm trying. We'll see. - What if one of them stops? What will you do? - Well, then I can climb aboard and go to see the Eiffel Tower again. - To see the Eiffel Tower again? You've seen it before? - Yes, but a very, very long time ago when I lived in Paris. - I spoke to Bernard just now, you know. - Did he tell you about Rose? - No? Who's Rose? - She was my fiancée. But she died during the war. - Ah OK. - Would you like me to show you something? Come with me. - What was your name back then? - Victor. My name was Victor. Look. See the stuffed dog next to the desk? It belonged to the former station master. Its name was Whistle. And I'm the only one who knows who killed it. Even Milos doesn't know that. - And who was it? - The boss of the junkyard. Not the current one, the one before. That man was scary. You know, I even helped your grandfather to build his house. Go to your basement, you can still check. Look at the floor, in the cement. I put my handprint next to Rose's. One night when it was just the two of us. And there's a date too. - Really? Well, I'll ask him if he remembers. - Yes, tell him about Victor. Victor the racing driver. - Do you remember I told you I was Marie-Antoinette? Well, now I'm pretty sure of it. - You're kidding me. You don't believe anything at all! - You must admit there's a good reason for not believing. - Why did you come then? - Because I saw you there, with your salads. I tthought it was funny. And Franck pissed me off. I preferred to walk home. All right, bye! Tell me Grandpa, do you remember Victor who helped you build your house? - Victor? Of course I remember him. He was a strong guy. He was from Paris but he came here to see Rose. They were engaged. A beautiful girl, Rose. She was a dancer. Poor girl, she died during the war. But—How do you know about Victor? - Down in the cellar, his name written on the floor. They were a hell of a couple, those two. I remember, in 1936, for the Popular Front ball, they organized a dance competition at the foundry. It was so crowded! We were number 10, we were dancing the tango. Tango is quite an art. The orchestra was playing all the new tunes. They were having a hard time— Just imagine, the poor things— They were all the old brass band players. They weren't used to it. Then Victor took me in his arms and bent me backwards. For a moment I thought I was going to fall. It was wonderful! - You should have seen them dance, the two of them. There were others who were good, but these two— - Did they win? - We even won the trophy. Poor Victor. He put it down to take me in his arms and kiss me. And when he turned round, the trophy had disappeared. It made us laugh. You see this? It's us. It was 1936. - You look so young. - The trophy was two bronze dancers. They didn't keep it long. As soon as they got the trophy, it was gone. The rumour was that the father-in-law stole it. - The dwarf? Basile! - What's up Grandma? - I would like you to come and help me. - All right, five minutes. I'll change and come down. I have to go. Mum's coming. - That doesn't matter. We'll continue later. I'm a bit tired today. Seeing your mum is much more important. You see her so rarely. - She said she was coming. But with her, I never know. She always says she doesn't have time. And, I have to go for a walk with Cécile this afternoon. Franck went to a wedding. And Cécile didn't want to go with him. - She's quite right. There's nothing more boring than a wedding. All that ritual. Lace and bow ties. And a marriage can be dangerous. Maybe it was an excuse to stay with you. - I daren't even go there. You know we see each other almost every day now? Franck goes to pick her up at the fair, but she said he annoys her sometimes. - Clearly— You know, if this continues, I'll end up being jealous. Hold on. Let me tidy you up a bit. Didn't you have a swim? - No, I was waiting for you. But you haven't brought your towel? - Oh no, I'm not swimming. The weather isn't nice enough. I want to pick up Franck at work. - I thought you weren't coming. - You're weird, I have things to do. - Did you tell Franck you were coming to swim? - Don't be daft, can you imagine if I'd told him? You'd hear him from here! - But you tell me when you're with him. - That's not the same. You aren't Franck's age. Even if you are reincarnated. - If you come with me to the island tomorrow I'm sure it won't be the same afterwards. - Tomorrow's no good. Franck's taking me to a motorcycle race. - Just this once. There'll be other races. When I was Victor I could have taken you to a car race. - When you get an idea stuck in your head— - We'll see. What time are you going to your island? - We'll meet here at 9 o'clock then go. - Good. If I'm not there by 9:30, just go on without me, OK? - Try to be here. Anyway, without you, I won't go. - Don't worry, I'll try to be here. I like you, really. I was just calling you to tell you not to come. We have to pick up my motorbike. - You could have done that earlier! - It doesn't matter, we'll drop you off. Because we're going to play billiards after. - No, I can easily walk home. - No no, it's on our way. - It's okay, don't worry, I'm old enough to go home alone. - Fine. Don't forget I'm picking you up tomorrow for the motorcycle race. - Yeah. Don't forget to bring your friends. If they cancel the race, we can play cards. That's really beautiful. So just like that you managed to lure Cécile into meeting you by the river? Bravo! You're a real Casanova. - Yes, and tomorrow I'm taking her to Lovers' Island. In Milos' boat. - No, really? - Yes, we're meeting at 9. - Then, hats off! I didn't think you'd succeed. But how did you manage to convince her? - I didn't do anything. I told her to come, that's all. I hope she'll come, because it isn't certain yet. She's supposed to be going to a motorcycle race with Franck. - That motorcyclist again? How awful! Oh no. I think she'll go for a boat trip. I'm sure of it. Young girls are romantic. They only dream of boat trips. A motorcycle race. The very idea. - I hope I'll be able to row. That way she'll wait for me to grow up. - Maybe she's already waiting. Beware of legends. And beware of young girls. They're capricious. Bring me that box, over there on the desk. Tomorrow, if you get to take Cécile with you to the island it has to be a day that's—unforgettable. This was Victor's first present. I've always kept it. Tomorrow— When you two are on the island— Give the bracelet to her. Put it around her wrist. It's my present. Come on now, you have to sleep. Tomorrow morning, you have to be at your best. Milos really trusts you. Do you think you can row over there? Your island's quite far out. I'm warning you, I don't know how to row. - Oh, don't worry, I'm used to it. It's not my first time. You just have to sit down, I'm coming. - Yeah. I'm not very confident. Is there supposed to be water in the bottom? Oh that's nothing, there's always a little. A good start. I think you're going off course there. - On purpose. Because of the currents. - There are currents too? - Yes, but I know them well. Milos made me a map. Here! Look. - That bit there, he's put very strong current underlined. - That's why, I have to go to the right then it flows down by itself to the island. - Easy to say. I hope you can swim, at least? Hullo? What are you doing here, my friend? Have you got the wrong address? - I'm looking for Cécile. Is she here? - Ah! Basile's little girlfriend? Of course she's not here. Why would you expect her to be at the station? - And the kid, I suppose he's not here either. Why are you asking me that? In the first place, you have no right to be here! - You'd better tell me right now where they are. What's up there? - There's nothing up there. It's forbidden to go upstairs. Get out of here! Good God! That was close! What the hell is Milos doing? He didn't close the gate! The barrier was open. It was set for us to cross. - Of course! That's it, smart guy! All you had to do was to get on the rails and signal for the train to stop. - Who's going to pay for the barrier? Who's at fault? - I won't tell you anything, you arsehole! At my age, I don't submit to interrogation! Listen! I don't know where Cécile is. But I can easily understand why she's not with you. - Milos! - Milos! Milos? - Are you here? Bastard! You know you nearly killed us? - Where's that guy going? - Dad! Don't let him go! He beat Milos up! - Hey you, you look as if you're in a hurry! What's this all about? Are we beating up seniors now? - No, your friend fell on his own. Well watch this! You'll fall on your own too! - Are you off your head? - Are you all right? - Isn't Basile with you? He told me you two were going fishing on the island. - I know nothing about that. Hold on! It's OK. He's a little knocked about but it's fine. - All right, you get out of here before I start to get angry. Where are you going? - I'll be back. Meet me at home. We're never going to make it to your island! That's twice we've passed by and turned round. Listen, it's perfectly normal. Nothing comes free. If you want to secure your fiancée forever, it's worth a little effort, isn't it? Why are you stopping? Do you know the legend of the island? Owl Island. But Owl Island isn't its real name. It's Lovers' Island. It's weird— I have a feeling your famous well-kept secret must be something like this. - No that's not it. - Look, you get full marks for effort. You're very brave. If you'd told me it was because of the legend that you wanted to take me on the island— I'd probably still have come. What do you know about that? You didn't even ask me. Come on, give me an oar. You're completely exhausted. We're not even moving forward. Come on, let's go home! - Oh shit, the oar! - Watch out! Take my hand, quick! Hang on! Come back! Never mind the oar! It doesn't matter! Basile! You OK? Are you alive? Don't cry, I'm here. I'll take you back. Don't worry about him. He'll see others. Islands are always too far. And they are often inaccessible. But I told you to beware of legends. You shouldn't be ashamed of having dreamed. I've been dreaming for 40 years. I travel, I dance— The public acclaims me. And I fall asleep, exhausted. Victor lying quietly beside me. And the whole world comes to visit me. Come here. Closer. You know—life is often beautiful when you dream it. But then— - It failed because I didn't tell her about the legend. - You didn't tell her anything? Do you think we can decide someone's whole life, even out of love, without asking her opinion, like that? - I wanted to tell her afterwards. Cécile will never want to talk to me again after this. - Maybe that's the legend of the island, after all. It's certainly necessary that lovers make decisions together to go to the island, to make it work. I don't know. I've only seen islands from very far away. - It's not worth going there. Legends aren't even true. - You think so? In all the island's existence, so many lovers have set foot there. But were they really happy? Come closer. There we are! Tonight, we're both the poor unfortunates who never went to the island. - Lucky I didn't lose it when I fell in the water. - You'd have seen me very angry if you had. I set up our record. To celebrate our victory. We could listen to it anyway. - Even so, Cécile still came over this morning. - There, you see? Forget that cursed island. Move on! Basile? Basile! Did you hear? - What? Seems like there's a broken window up there. - Well, go upstairs and look. - I called Basile. He's not answering. You wouldn't like to go up, would you? - Don't you think you're taking this too far? She won't jump down your throat when you go up there. - I see I can always call on you when I need anything! Paris, August 17, 1917, Dear Mrs. Colin and my little Rose, I'm still in Paris but I promise you I'll pick Rose up for her name day, September 16. Thank you for your kindness. My respects to Mr. Colin, Adélaïde Packard Well? You're not asking if your dear old Milos died? - Do you think you can fix everything? - Fix everything, fix everything! You're good with words! I have a lot of work to do. - But I didn't do it on purpose. - I hope not. After all, it's just wood from the forest. The main thing is you haven't broken anything. Well you should have rung while you were there! Hey, it slipped on its own! I couldn't see in the dark. It's worth working on the ghost train if you can't see at night! - Can you turn you head away with the lamp? You're dazzling me! - There's always something with you. But, I can't see the stairs. - Switch on the light! - There we are! We'll put it on the sideboard. I'll get rid of our wedding photos. - That'll piss her off! - No, it won't! Anyway, she doesn't like herself in those photos. - She'll shit herself! Imagine her face when she sees a python on the sideboard. - Don't you worry She won't say anything. No woman can resist me. - But Mum isn't a woman. - So what is she then? A mongoose? Come on, you'd better go to bed. I need to take care of the animals. Are you awake, darling? - Yes, yes, I'm coming. I'm in the bathroom. - I made your breakfast, honey. - What? Oh that's why! You fell asleep on the tap again. - I brought you your boots. - I hate you! If you think I' going to put up with having my coffee with a grass snake— - It's not a grass snake. It's a molurus python. - Yes well, molurus python or not, please get the thing out of here. And put my wedding photos back where they should be. - But you don't like yourself in the photos. I thought you'd be happy. - There's no use arguing! Well then, are you going to get the pump? Yeah— Dummy! - Grandpa, can I go with you? - Yeah. - Where have you come from? Did you go out the window again? - I left my boots downstairs. You don't know yet you have to sleep with them? In this madhouse. You have aged! But you're still the same. I forgot how insignificant you were. - Did you open the door? - Maybe. I wanted to see how your wrinkles had grown. - You've never looked in the mirror? - Me? I'm not old. I'm dead. It was you who killed me. - I see you haven't lost your grandiosity. - I think you mean grandiloquence. Your little air of grandiloquence. It's true you've always lacked vocabulary. - If you think you'll impress me with your high and mighty attitude— - Of course I impress you. You could even say I scare you. You've been scared to death for 40 years. Which proves once and for all that you're particularly stupid! If I had wanted to I could have told your legionary everything a long time ago, don't you think? The worthy Emile. Who went to save the honour of the Fatherland in Tonkin. We still don't know if he came back. If he'd known it was thanks to his Luce that the wedding turned into a nightmare. Luce Colin, making her resistance between two rows of knitting. Thanks to her the bride was blown up with the bridge. To think I almost didn't go to the wedding. And Luce— She should have informed the wedding party, but didn't. She didn't follow Victor's instructions. And all this for what? To get rid of me. To get rid of a dancer. Couldn't you have waited until I was alone? To kill me? If I said nothing, it was because of our parents. They didn't deserve this. Afterwards, I forgot. Don't think it was easy. Hate is something solid. But it's terribly ugly. Did I forgive you? That I don't know. But I ended up feeling pity for you. It's much less tiring. - You think anyone would have believed you? A half-senile cripple trying to settle her accounts? - Shut your mouth. Otherwise you'll make me regret not having said anything. Clearly, there's nothing to be done. You'll never be anything but an ogre of jealousy. - You do all you can to make me hate you. That record, non-stop, why? - You haven't heard it for a long time. And I always loved this music. That's all. - That's typical of you. Rose, hovering above the darkness of the world. It's true I was jealous. Drop-dead jealous. You stole everything from me. Even my parents. You got all their attention. Everyone admired you. Everyone loved you. Rose the dancer, Rose so beautiful, so smart. And me in all this? Who was I? Nobody. Barely the star's half-sister. You made me an ogre of jealousy. As you put it. Because you've never been anything but an ogre of pride! That car on the bridge. You think I never had regrets? Good God! I was 18, I had no idea. If I had imagined the horror. And to be obliged to live with this remorse. Still. It would be useless to ask your forgiveness. - Look at that photo. Basile hung it here. She's supposed to be me. It's hard to believe. Go on. Go back downstairs to your zoo. I don't want to talk about this any more. I just wanted to see old Luce breathe. It's done. Don't worry about the music, you won't hear it any more. Go away! Basile is coming. It's the beautiful Rose who interests him. The girl in the photo, smiling in the convertible. Go on, leave me now. I have hundreds of things to do. Tomorrow I have an important appointment I don't want to miss. I have to put everything in order. I wonder where I put this postcard— - It's in Basile's room. Right then, Deauville. We going there or not? - No, I don't feel like it. - You'd rather go with the kid on a boat trip? - Why not? At least he doesn't beat up old people. - That'd be hard for him, he's ten kilos soaking wet. - That's so clever! If you have to beat people up when they're weaker than you, I feel sorry for you. Still, you're covered in bandages. - Yeah, the other one pissed me off. And the fat one fell on me by surprise. Otherwise I'd have taken his head off. - Don't you think you've done enough? I don't date stupid guys. - Long story short, it's over. - Exactly what I intended to tell you. - All because of a kid who fed you bullshit about being reincarnated or whatever? - And? It's possible. Stop banging on the ceiling like that, it's annoying! You know, the morning I went to the island, my grandfather told me a weird story. Seems there's a legend that if you take your fiancée there, you'll be together for life. I'm sure that's why Basile wanted to take me there. I think that's really beautiful, you know. This kid's eleven. Maybe he's in love with me and he didn't dare tell me. He must be awfully sad. - What about it? - He was afraid I'd say no. - Well, I hope you would! - You just don't have a clue, do you! - No need to take someone to an island to tell them you love them. No need to tell them anything anyway. We show it. - Plenty people spend their lives saying nothing to each other. I think you'd better go. Have you got the old cups? - Yes, those are the ones I normally use. - Well this once, you can take the cups from the service. - Seriously? You don't mind? - They should be used. Isn't this Saint Rose's day? Aren't you going to the fair? It's the last day. - I'm not bothered any more. - By the way. That big book with a dancer on it. Was it you gave it back to Rose? - Yes, it was. Look, I found the Eiffel Tower postcard. Where your mum says she's picking you up. - Oh, did you have it? I was looking for it everywhere. - By the way, how old is your mum there? - I don't know—Thirty? Thirty-two maybe. Memory is weird. Adélaïde Packard. Do you realize, if she'd aged, she'd be over 100 now. You don't take the train at that age? It's not possible. No! She's still thirty, that's it! - Do you think she looks like you? - How would I know? I've never seen her. All I can say— Is that she's very tall. She's very beautiful. And she's very attractive. And when she arrives at the station, you'll see. All the men will look at her. - All right, I'm going straight to the station! To see what time there's a train. Then, maybe I'll come back with her. - Take your time! She has all day to get here. I wonder if I'm not a little afraid of seeing her coming in here. - Oh no, it'll be good when she's here. - Yes, you're right. It has to happen one day. Basile! - Is that Cécile? - Go and see what she wants. - I haven't seen her since the other day, When I took her out on the boat. Basile, are you there? - At least it proves she isn't holding it against you. What do you want? - I found something in my attic that'll interest you. - Coming. Aren't you upset with me about the other day on the river? - No need to talk about that again. Lets' go! I can't tell you what it did to me when I saw it all, falling from the ceiling. Do you realize? You were right. I'm sure it was the dwarf who stole all this. He must have been really mad, that old man! And look on the suitcase, there? Isn't that the dance trophy? When you won the dance contest with your fiancée? - How do you know about the dance contest? - You're not the only one who who knows things. Maybe I was there too, at that famous ball. No that's not true. My grandfather told me about it. He was there. Anyway, I have the impression Rose must have been an amazing girl. Have you seen all those handbags? - Odette Mathieu, born in 1883. - Wow that's old! - Françoise Faucher, born in Draveil in 1900. - You can take the statue. After all, it is yours. There are even train tickets to Paris in this one. Look! There's a picture of a baby on a blanket. What's that one's name? Adélaïde Packard. - What name did you say? - Adélaïde Packard. Do you know her? - Show me! - Are you okay? Who is that woman? - Adélaïde isn't a woman. She's Rose's mum. She's arriving today. I have to pick her up. I lied to you. The thing about Victor wasn't true. Rose didn't die during the war. She's still living in my house. She never went out because she didn't want to see anyone any more. And she can't dance any more either. I lied. Nothing I told you was true. Madame! Madame! It's me. I came to meet you. I'm Basile, I've come from Rose. - Rose? I don't know any Rose. - Your name isn't Adélaïde Packard? - I think you're mistaken, my boy. - What will I say to Rose? Sir, please! Sir, please! Could you show me— Sir, please, could you show me the way to the Chemin des Vignes? I saw Adélaïde. She's waiting for you at the station. I don't know what time there's a train. Because the station is a bit damaged. I brought her handbag. The tickets to Paris are in it. We can't let anyone steal them. She couldn't come because she doesn't know the address. Here, look, it's true. There are the tickets, and my name on them. When she got off the train, I recognized her right away. She's awfully beautiful. Here, look, there's your photo. If there's no train today, we can go back to the station tomorrow. Or we'll wait until next year. We'll wait for your name day. It would be bad if you leave right away. I can't dance well yet. You must teach me. But maybe you're a little tired. We'll see about that tomorrow, okay? Rose Packard c/o M and Mme Colin Chemin des Vignes When we're old—We just need to call on Death and he comes to get us. Today September 16 Adélaïde came to collect Rose. —Victor English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille TNT 2023
