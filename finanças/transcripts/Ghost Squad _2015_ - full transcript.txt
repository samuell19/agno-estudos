BOY: I can't see a thing in here. Ow. Will you cut it out? - BOY #2: What? - Get off my foot. BOY #2: That wasn't me. Hey, watch it. BOY #3: Sorry, I think that was me. - Big shock. - BOY #1: Can somebody just find the flashlight? - BOY #3: Listen. - BOY #1: I don't hear anything. BOY #2: Hold on, I think I found it. Wait. There it is again. You must have dog ears, 'cause the only thing I hear is Charlie breathing. Let's just get out of here. This is really stupid. Yeah. Next time you hear that there's some kind of hideous, deformed creature living in some old abandoned building, do us a favor and leave us out of it. Hey, I had a solid lead. Jeanie Taylor told Martie Nixon. And I heard her telling Ethan Reynolds about it in Phys Ed. Besides, I didn't know we were going to end up trapped in a broom closet. That's a solid lead? Nice going, goggles. You are so not cut out for this. Hey, don't call me that. Would you two knock it off already? Trust me, whatever it is you thought you heard, it's gone. Let's just go home. See? I told you there's nothing out here. You were saying? That's got to be the wind or something. I'm leaning more towards "something." come on, let's check it out. I don't think that's such a good idea. Fine, stay here then. Yeah, stay here. Uh, an even worse idea. What's that? Thermal camera. Monster tracker. Shh. I think I heard something. What is it? Something's over there. - I don't see anything. - Guys? I think we might want to find another way out here. Well, well, look what we got here. Out favorite middle-school wimps. The monster geek squad! Actually, it's "Elite Monster-Hunting Unit," you Neanderthal. Oh, get up. "Neanderthal"? That sounds bad. It has a bunch of those, uh, whatchamacallums? Syllables, moron. Oh yeah? How about a bruise for every syllable? Ne-an-der-thal! Ah! What's wrong, dorks? No science club today, so you thought you'd try the life of crime, huh? A little breaking and entering? Truth be told, we were chasing down an unidentified beast-like creature right inside that old building. We have it trapped in there. Cork it, geek boy! Nobody's talking to you. What gives, Charlie? What are you and the dork patrol doing mess around the old bank? None of your business. Whoa! Take it down a notch, brainiac, or you'll be chewing on a knuckle sandwich. A triple decker! Hey, yeah, what's with this jacket anyway? You wear this stupid thing every day. He's thinks he's going to Hartford someday! Uh, doubt it! It's "Harvard," you meathead. You know, you might have thought high school would have made you a little bit smarter. And that jacket belonged to his brother, the Marine. Where are the Marines when we need them?! A beast-like creature? Could you be bigger wimps? Figures dorks like you would be afraid of a little kitty cat. Wait till all the other losers at their school hear about this! You're dead meat, Hamilton! GIRL: Nice costume, dork. Told you-hardly anyone else is wearing a costume. I feel like a total idiot. Dude, it's Halloween. We always wear costumes. But don't you think we might be getting a little bit old for this kind of stuff? No. Guys! It finally came! "Swamp Monsters" 217! The one where the swamp alien has to battle the zombie slime creatures. He ends up having to eat his own head. - Hey, Charlie! - Oh! Brandy, hey. How's it going? Did you finish your chapter for the Chem Lab notes last night? Oh, yeah, Chem Lab! Absolutely! I, uh, got 'em right here. Oh yeah. Nice costume. You supposed to be a dog or something? Oh, no, werewolf actually. It's cute. Yeah, we were actually just making fun of all the losers that actually wear costumes. Yeah, usually we're way more mature- I can see that. Oh, great. We could run. I hear Mexico is lovely this time of year. What's this? "A guide to demons, monsters and aliens"? Ooh, which chapter are you in? This is so lame, jake. Just leave them alone. Oh, hey look, it's the geek patrol. Not so bad when you're not armed with a milkshake, are you? Serious, Jake! I'm gonna tell ma. Hey, why don't you guys knock it off? What's the matter? Run out of kids to bully at your own school? - You had to come back here? - Jake! How much grass do you think Charlie here could eat before he chucks it all up, huh? - Maybe we should find out. - Get off of him! - How about a game, twerps? - Ah! Oh, get real! These losers couldn't play football against my grandma's knitting club. And those old bags can't even walk. Yeah, we were thinking about taking the day off from anything that requires the human brain. So yeah, maybe football might just do the trick. What did you say, geek boy? It sounded like an insult, but, no, that can't be right. That would require guts, which you and the wimp brigade don't have. Charlie! You're not exactly helping here. Any rock-for-brains can throw a football. Well, apparently not anyone, since you and your team have lost almost every game this year, and set the record for most interceptions in a season. Oh really? Let's see you do this, Einstein. Uh, you were saying? I was saying that it doesn't take much for a bunch of morons to go out on the court and bash each other's brains in. It's a field, professor, not a court. No, all right. All right, Charlie, I got something for you, now that you're Mr. Big and Bold. Let's hear it. Name your challenge. Uh, all right. Uh... the old Sullivan place- one night. - Ooh! - You and the geek squad spend an entire night up there. - Excuse me? - Oh, you heard me. The Sullivan house, one night. Isn't that place supposed to be haunted? Oh, is it? Yeah, that's the point, loser. You guys think you're some kind of monster experts? Prove it. That's what I thought. Name the time and place. We'll be there. Tomorrow-Halloween. Done. Okay, Charlie, it's your funeral. Behind the school, bike path, tomorrow, 6:00. Be there. What did you just get us into? Please tell me this is a dream. - I think the word is "nightmare." - come on, guys! Are we going to let them show us up for the rest of our lives? How many more swirlies and wedgies and wet willies are we going to have to take? I don't know, Charlie, but I'd rather take more of what they're dishing out than go near that Sullivan house. Yeah, Charlie, the house is haunted. Not sure what's confusing about that. And you guys actually believe that? Yeah, why wouldn't we? You just want us to come with you. Guys, we're going to be in the same school as them next year. Do you really want to be a punching bag for those jerks 'til we graduate? Fine, I'm done. So what do you have in mind? Yeah, what's the plan? Meet me at my house at 6:00. I'll lay it out for you guys. - So you mean you'll make it up as you go? - Exactly. Charlie, I wish you'd drink more milk. Stop with all that soda. I'm allergic to milk, mom. Remember? And I haven't had a soda in, like, forever. Yeah, he's allergic to everything, - especially girls. - Zip it, runt. Oh no, you don't still have the hots for the girl in your Chemistry Lab, do you? I'm serious, Todd. I've got a better idea. Why don't you come over here and make me zip it? Hey! He threw his peas at me! And they say you can't train a baby. Charlie, Todd, stop it. Just eat. I got you some almond milk. They say it's better for your digestive tract. Yeah, Charles, or how about some of Noah's baby formula? I'm warning you, Todd. Warning me how? Sit down and be quiet, Todd, or I'm going to let Charlie have five minutes alone with you off the leash. Not cool, Russ! Hey, guys? You might want to come over here and read this. "During the 1950s, "the Sullivan Gang was rumored to be responsible "for over 30 bank robberies in California alone. "they were finally killed in a shootout "right here in Elk Falls at their hide-out, "the old Sullivan place. Cops said it was a total bloodbath." Like, body parts everywhere! It also says the place is supposed to be haunted by the gang and their vicious old dog Salty. Haunted by a dog? Let me see that. "Over the years, many citizens of Elk Falls "have reported hearing strange noises "coming from the house, "which to this day remains abandoned "due to an ongoing dispute over ownership "and the city's inability to find a buyer willing to take on the troubled property." NICK: Dude! Look at these guys! They look like total psychos! Hey, this one looks just like you, goggles. Haunted by a dog? What a bunch of baloney! The place is just old. We're doing this. End of story. Yeah, we kind of have to. We chicken out now, our lives at Joe Dante middle school are gonna suck. - Probably high school too. - It already sucks. Yeah, but we're talking about it going to an entirely new level. How are we going to get our parents to let us stay the night in that old house? It's simple. We tell our parents that we're staying over at each other's houses, and by morning, we're heroes. Jake and those other lug nuts won't be able - to push us around anymore. - NICK: I gotta go home. My mom's making something that vaguely resembles meatloaf. If I don't get there soon, my sister will gives hers to the dog before I can. Remember, we meet behind the school tomorrow at 6:00. Does this mean no trick-or-treating? ALEX: What do you think? CHARLIE: This will be better. Trust me. NICK: Oh, okay, Charlie. - See you tomorrow night, Charlie. - No you won't. Got your new wrestling coach coming over tomorrow night, remember? - Charlie doesn't wrestle. - I hate wrestling, dad. Well, that's why you're going to take lessons. That doesn't make any sense. You need to do something more physical, okay? You're wasting too much time at your computers. What kind of wrestling coach comes over on Halloween, anyway? Bye, boys. But dad, we have a big geometry test coming up. We're in a study group together. I can't let my friends down. What about letting your dad down? Day after tomorrow, I promise. I expect to see an "A" on that test. Geometry test, huh? I know what you guys are doing. - You don't know anything. - Really? Maybe we should have a talk with mom and dad then. I'll do your homework for a week. You're not getting my bank. I already looked in there. There's not enough. 25 bucks, that's the price for my silence. I'll kill him for free. Deal. Not a word. And you're doing my homework. I'm impressed. Didn't think you guys would show. This is a piece of cake. If you're doing this for my sister, forget about it. - You got no shot with her. - I'm doing this because I'm tired of you guys always giving us a hard time. We do this, you guys back off. Deal? Deal, but I won't hold my breath. Ha! You clowns ready? Born ready. Yeah? Well, talk is cheap, professor. Smart money says you won't make it 'til dark. I bet they don't even go inside. Let's just do this. Are you sure about this, Charlie? You don't have to. Sure he is! The dare is you stay the entire night. Of course if you decide to split early, youtube and the whole rest of the world will be watching. You guys will be on hidden cameras all night. Uh, bye, boys. Can we go now, please? What are you doing? We didn't even get to the house yet. My dad! We're supposed to be studying for a math test at your house, remember? Come on, let's go. Are we almost there yet, Charlie? Almost. Hey, did you read the new "zombie invasion" comic? Yes, it's awesome! Dude, it was awesome. I like "the zombie warrior" better. Well, yeah, because that was the first one. I mean, it's expected. What now? How are we getting in this place? Okay, come on. There, that's our entrance. We pry that wood off and slip inside. Let's see here. We're sure we really want to do this? Don't chicken out now, Nick. They could be watching us on those cameras. No turning back now. This is way too easy. This is going to be an awesome night. Meet up at my place in an hour, make sure everything's ready. - I got this. - Tonight, those dipsticks are going to get a double dose of ghost. - Do you guys really have cameras in there? - Jake's dad works security. He gave me a few toys. Heighten the experience a little. Plus we got to make sure your friends don't wuss out. Don't you think that's kind of mean, Jake? Absolutely! CHARLIE: Oh, my face. Would you get off me, please? I'm trying! Man, it's higher than I thought. I don't think we could get back out that way even if we wanted to. Great! So we're trapped in here? We shouldn't even be here, Charlie. This is all your fault. Yeah, I had my grimm reaper super-hero costume all ready to go for tonight. But no, I'm trapped here in this stupid old haunted house with you guys! Would you guys calm down? You whine worse than my baby brother. ALEX: So you're calling us babies? Yeah, snot-nosed little diaper-wearing babies. Okay, that's it. I'm done. Party's over. Give me a boost, Nick. No way, you give me a boost. Guys, you really want to leave? Aren't you tired of those jerks always getting the best of us? This is our chance to show everyone what we're made of. We go back out that window now, we can never show our faces in the school again. We can do this, you know we can. Unless you really think we're the gutless losers they say we are. We're not losers. So prove it. Come on, guys. Forget those guys, right? I guess. CHARLIE: Let's take inventory. Supply check. I brought the entertainment. Ipad, video game, dvd, D.S., and G.P.S., just in case. Oh, and this. Nice touch. Thought you'd appreciate the irony. I brought the food. Chips, salsa-not too spicy- drinks, chocolate-covered debby cakes, and my personal favorite, hungry boy fried chicken dinners. These are frozen dinners. They'll thaw out by the time we eat them. All right, so I brought the batteries, matches, non-drip candles. No one will ever know that we were here. What about the window? Cat did it. Oh, and these- standard army flashlights. - They're the real deal. - NICK: No, thanks. I have my cactus jack ranger pocket knife. It has a light built into it. Look. Did you get that out of cereal box? - It's for small, tight spaces. - Like your brain? Let's just look around and find a place to settle down for the night. Maybe we should just stay right here. In a dusty old basement? I don't think so. Let's just go. This place smells like a dungeon. Ready? Be quiet, just in case. Just in case what? In case the bloody, rotting corpses of the Sullivan Gang - are still living upstairs. - That's not funny! Hello? Anyone home? Are you crazy, Charlie? It's just us. Let's go. You guys waiting for a formal invitation? Maybe we should go back downstairs. They'll never know. Rangers never retreat. You guys coming or what? What do you see? Uh, big empty house. See for yourself. Whoa, look at that. NICK: Wow! This is pretty cool. Yeah, see? No ghosts, no Sullivan Gang, no Salty. Yeah. Hey, we found a perfect spot for us. Oh, and the best part? After tomorrow, no more Jake and his meathead friends bothering us. I have to admit, I thought you were out of your gourd for getting us into this. Yeah, this actually turned out to be a pretty good idea, Charlie. So, if you Neanderthals are watching us, hello from the haunted house. Jake, help us! Zombies got us and turned us into the living dead. Yeah! Please tell our teachers we won't be coming back to school anymore. They can give our homework to someone else. You really think the Sullivan Gang ever lived here? I don't know. Doesn't really matter, though. I mean, you saw all the furniture in there. Somebody lived there, a long time ago, anyway. ALEX: And besides, there's no such thing as ghosts. That's what they always say in the movies right before one shows up and rips their face off. CHARLIE: Wow, it's really pretty. Yeah, just like Brandy Benson. Don't even, Alex! Got to admit, Charlie, we wouldn't be here right now if Brandy wasn't standing there yesterday. Yep, you'd be out trick-or-treating, just like you always do. What's wrong with trick-or-treating? It's for kids. Oh yeah, so what's that make you? - Some kind of grown-up? - ALEX: Truce, guys. Look at this- sunset, three friends. This is a total beer-commercial moment. You guys are ruining it. Okay. But he started it. And yeah, Brandy Benson is beautiful. What are you doing? Tempting fate. That's what Rangers do. Dude, that's what idiots do. Get over here. - Come on, dude. - ALEX: Man, come on. I don't remember it being this dark in here. What are you doing now? Seeing if any of the light switches work. That would be a great idea if there were any lights to turn on. But there aren't. So just stay close, okay? Did we leave the door open? What's that down there? It's just the wind. I thought I heard it say something. Nick! I'm coming to get you. If it gets me, I promise, it's getting you first. That's right, boys. Make yourselves comfortable. It's going to be a bumpy ride. When do the ghosts arrive? Hey, patience, amigo. They'll be making a house call very soon. I've got it all wired into that single unit. Can control it all from there. You promised I could do this part, Jake. And I am a man of my word. I've never eaten a frozen drumstick before. CHARLIE: Just suck on it till it melts. Then you can bite into it. Sorry, I had to grab whatever I could before my mom asked me where I was going with three hungry boy meals. This piece is a little softer. Kind of slushy. Not bad. MAN ON TV: Get out, Debbie! Debbie, look out! What? Nothing. Sometimes I think you're a little hard on Charlie. That's all. No, my old man was hard on me. I had a job when I was 13. These kids live lives of leisure. It wouldn't kill you to try a little harder. That's all I'm saying. I asked him to help me fix the car last weekend. He said no. What am I gonna do? He's a smart kid. He likes what he likes. Did you ever think maybe that doesn't include wresting or fixing the car? What kids don't like wrestling and fixing cars? It might be nice to take an interest in the things that he's interested in. Charlie's growing up. Todd too. We have this tiny little window where they actually still want to be with us. You're missing it. Oh, I think Noah needs a new diaper. Can you smell his butt for me? Okay, Todd, let's go! We're gonna go get dinner. Get in the car. TODD: Aw, man! Shut up, Todd. - BOY: Go on! - Yeah, do it! This is so much better than trick-or-treating. Ooh, smarties! Dibs! Check it out. I added a skull there. Plus the hand coming out of the grave. Dude, you wrote that on your science book? Yeah. It's either that or study photosynthesis. What if somebody sees it? You bring "zombie invasion" 33? Ho ho ho! Who do you think would win in a fight? The zombie warrior or the big plant monster from "tales of terror" 16? Can't we talk about something other than that stupid kids' stuff all the time? I like being a kid. Yeah, what's so great about being a grown-up anyway? The only thing I ever hear my parents talking about are bills, "how come you didn't stop at the grocery store on the way home?" Or how to, like, lower your cholesterol and stuff. Okay, Mr. Grown-Up. You promised to tell us the Brandy story. Let's hear it. Yeah, what is it about that girl that makes you volunteer to do crazy stuff like this? It's not normal. It's not much of a story. Okay, you can hardly remember your name when she's around. - That's something. - Well... it all started- it was last summer. I was on my way home from the pool and I saw Brandy's dad doing some yard work. And I asked him if I could give him a hand. And he said, "sure, come marry my beautiful daughter." No! Then I spent the next two hours bagging up all the leaves and stuff and taking them out to the curb. What does that have to do with Brandy? Well, when I was finished, Mr. Benson goes inside, and a few minutes later... Brandy comes out to give me some money for the work. It was like everything just stopped. ALEX: Then what happened? Then I said goodbye and left. - That's it? - So she touched your hand and you've been gaga over her ever since? Pretty much. What was that? Let's find out. No way. I'm staying right here. Your choice. We'll be right back. You guys can't leave me here alone. Watch us. All right, then give me your cactus jack ranger knife. No way, I'm coming with you. What are you doing? We're not supposed to hit them with the big guns till later. I didn't do anything. That wasn't me. Odds or even? - What? - To see who goes in first. This whole thing was your idea, fearless leader. I nominate you. Just so you know, if it's some maniac with a chainsaw, I'm leaving you guys in the dust. - Charlie? - Shh! You can put the knife away, goggles. It's just a branch. Must have broke off in the wind. Hey, a Ranger can never be too careful. Who got mashed potatoes again? Get me the six-piece extra-crispy combo, Russ. Wings and drumsticks only. You think you could call me dad, at least when we're in public? Okay, dad. White meat, extra sauce. Can I help you with something? You're Brandy Benson. Do I know you? You're the screensaver on my brother's computer. Your picture, he stares at it all day. And your brother is? - Charlie. Charlie Hamilton. - I told you he was a stalker. You know he's only doing this to impress you. What do you mean? I know all about him spending the night in the old Sullivan place. Him and the other two rocket scientists he hangs out with. You're prettier in person. What a weirdo. I'm worried about Charlie. I should have never let him agree to this stupid thing in the first place. First of all, you didn't let him do anything. He made his own bed and now he has to sleep in it. That bed just happens to be an incredibly scary old haunted house. Just lightning. I think we'll keep this on just in case. Just in case what? That had to be the basement door, right? Yeah, it's just the wind. Okay, the wind blows the door shut. I heard it slam. So how exactly does the wind blow it open again? Okay, Mr. "It's just the wind," you want to explain that one to me? Your dad's gear is completely off the hook. Dude, look at those little losers. You got the place totally rigged. That's nothing. Check it out. I bet this scares them right out of the house. What was that? Is there someone in here with us? I say we get the heck out of here. I've said "uncle" enough times in my life to know when to say it, Charlie. And this is one of those times. He's right. Let's get out of here, Charlie. - To heck with the bet. - I'm not leaving. I've always wondered what a ghost looked like up close. - Are you crazy? - Nope. I just don't believe in ghosts. If I don't make it back, make sure Todd doesn't get my $25. Gah! Didn't want you to have all the fun. Hello? Let's run! Help me with this, you guys! Put your backs up against it! Turn your light on, Charlie. I can't see a thing in here. It's out there. I dropped it. Nice going, Charlie! Where's your cactus jack ranger light? I left it in my sleeping bag. Well, we're not getting out this way. - What time is it? - What does that matter?! Sunrise is 6:48 A.M. I looked it up! I say we stay right here until it's light. Then we make a break for the front door. Look, if whatever is out there wanted to hurt us, it would have done it already. Maybe it's just trying to scare us. It's doing a pretty good job. D- d-did you just see that? That sheet just moved. Maybe it's just the wind again. There is no wind in this room. What am I looking at? I could have sworn that thing moved. Look, there's got to be a logical explanation for all of this. This house is really old and it's got creaks and drafts and all kinds of crazy stuff. Just like my grandma Arletta. It's moving again. CHARLIE: Didn't we just go through this? Guys? ALEX: Charlie? I think he's right. - Run! - Which way? To anywhere but here! Go! Oh, are you all right? I tripped over something. I think you tripped over this. What is it? Come on. Just as I thought. Jake. Him and his meathead friends rigged all this up so that we'd leave and they'd win the bet. I mean, think about it- slamming doors, the scary footsteps. Come on. Let's see what else they set up for us. Yeah. Maybe we can give them a little surprise. Carol, we're out of candy. Mr. Hamilton? There's something I need to tell you. JAKE: Whoa whoa, what's going on? I told you not to touch anything. I didn't touch anything. Well, then what happened to the picture? Maybe a ghost got 'em. Very funny. We're missing all the action. - Reboot it. - I did. It's not working. Come on, let's go get a closer look. Uh, how close exactly? Front-row seats. So you knew your brother was sneaking off to pull this crazy stunt - and you didn't tell anybody? - Dad, he begged me. I don't want to hear another word from you. $25? Is that what a lie goes for these days? Mr. Hamilton, Charlie was really determined. Charlie and his friends lied. What if they got hurt or they needed help? I wouldn't even know where to find them. Mr. Hamilton. Didn't you do anything like this when you were a kid? My dad was never a kid. All right, get in the van, Todd. I'm not done with you. Come on, I'll give you a ride home. And then I'm going to deal with this nonsense. Let's go! Watch it, Russ. There's your Sullivan-Gang ghosts, all in one neat little pile. This is Jake's dad's stuff. That's how they rigged the entire house. It's also how they made all the doors close and stuff. No ghosts, huh? You sound disappointed. A little. Maybe we should just leave now. They'll never know the difference. Forget about that. Look, when we walk out of here tomorrow morning, I want to see the look on Jake and his friends' faces when we throw all of this stuff right back at 'em. Neanderthals! But before we go, let's take one last look around to make sure that there aren't any more surprises. Please? Come on. Let's check out all the windows and meet back here. We'll see who has the best view inside. And don't make any noise. Those little dorks think they're so smart, don't they? You're mad, aren't you? Good night, Brandy. Sorry you had to get dragged through all this. I'm not. Charlie's my friend. I know he lied to you, Mr. Hamilton, but it was for a good reason. Yeah, to prove to those other kids he's some kind of tough guy. That's not Charlie, Mr. Hamilton. I think he did it to prove to himself he wasn't afraid. It's not easy being a kid, you know? Especially when you're afraid all the time. What would you know about that? I'm scared all the time that people won't like me, that I'll disappoint my parents, that people will realize I'm a dork just like everybody else and I won't be popular anymore. I guess it's tough being a kid sometimes. That's exactly what I've been trying to tell you, Russ. Shut up, Todd. There's nothing back there. Same here. Rooms are all empty. They're in there. I just saw a flashlight in the hallway. Hold on, I think they're coming back. I think I see something. You hear that? JAKE: Go go go! Go go go! Guess it was nothing. Man, this was so much more fun than trick-or-treating. There's always a next year. You'll be 14 next year. Hey, as long as people are giving out candy, I'm putting on a costume. I don't care if I'm 50. What was that? Some kind of prehistoric monster. - There's no such thing. - What was it then? Big teeth, red eyes, claws to rip your face off. Whatever it was, those little twerps are stuck in there with it. Shouldn't we do something? Yeah. Yeah, go home and keep your mouths shut. Those big shots want to show us how tough they are? Now is their chance. Unless you want to go back and help them? Yeah, that's what I thought. Let's go. Okay, this is where you get out. Go. What are you gonna do? I'm not sure yet. You mean there's a chance I could still get my $25? You're such an idiot. Go in the house and tell your mother I'll call her in a few minutes. I want to go with you. That's not happening. Good night. I'm serious. So am I! Go inside. Look, I know I'm not the best brother a kid could have. You think? But I do care about Charlie. I want to see if he's okay. Put your seatbelt back on. We're going. Okay, so maybe I want to protect my investment too. Shut up, Todd. 'Night, guys. Leave your light on, Charlie. Okay. Yeah, no more scary bedtime stories. I think the excitement's over for the night. See you guys in the morning. Yeah, good night. CAROL: I think that's a terrible idea. RUSS: Look, will you just listen for one minute? He lied, Russ. His friends too. We have to tell their parents. I'm not condoning what he did. If we let him stay the night in that house, it's like saying that lying was okay. He is gonna be punished, I promise. Yeah, be tough, Russ. Zip it or you're walking home. I don't know, Russ. Don't try to tell me this is some kind of guy thing. Well, it kind of is. Charlie's friend Brandy was right. He should stay the night in the house, see something through. Maybe he could learn that way. Honesty is what he needs to learn. If he asked us to let him stay the night in this old house- we would have said no. Exactly. He's 13. He's trying to figure out how to be a man. You told me I should take interest in what he's doing, so why don't you let me? Nothing's going to happen to him. Todd and I are sitting right outside the door. If I see any kind of trouble, I'll pull the plug. All right, Russ. But this one is on you. I will see you in the morning. Thanks again for letting me come, Russ. Yeah, well, just keep an eye on the house. - Alex, Nick, wake up. - What's up? There's something going on over there. I thought we'd found all of Jake's little toys. Well, apparently we didn't. Go check it out. What are you doing? I'm getting my Ranger knife. ALEX: For what? You never know. Hey, danger is my middle name. Did they-did they drop you on your head as a kid? Only once. It is so somebody else's turn. Go ahead, just do it already. It must have turned on by accident. You guys see a remote anywhere? I'm pretty sure this TV was made before remote controls were invented. Maybe there was a power surge. There is no power in this house. How could there be a power surge? Um, guys? It's not plugged in. Let's not overreact. How do you explain the TV? I can't, okay? But it's not the time to panic. "Dateline Elk Falls." the tale of a band of notorious outlaws known as the Sullivan Gang - appears to be coming to a close. - It's about the Sullivan Gang! Local authorities have announced that they in fact have the Sullivans wanted in connection with over 30 bank robberies since 1952 surrounded at their hideout in Elk Falls. - The Sullivan Gang... - I think it's time to panic. Let's get out of here. I'll see you out front! Sure to be a fateful clash with local police. NICK: Let me try. We're locked in. I'm not liking this one bit. The back door. Very slowly. What the heck is that? What was that? I don't know. You want to go back and ask? What now? Put your light on it. The batteries are dead! Where's yours? I left it by my sleeping bag! Nice work, Sherlock! - Run! - Where? This way! In here quick. Wait, wait, wait, wait, how do we know it's safe in there? BOTH: We'll take our chances! Me too! - Lock the door, Alex! - There is no lock. I want to go home. Nothing gets through this door. What was that? That sure wasn't Jake and his friends. I don't know and I don't want to find out. Go away! Leave us alone! I think whatever was out there is gone. What if it's waiting for us to open the door? - We have to open it eventually. - No we don't. So we stay here until? College. Or until our parents come to find us. - Yeah! Then they kill us. - Parents I can deal with. Whatever that thing is, it's three of us versus one of them. What exactly is the "them"? I don't know, but if we stick together, we'll be okay. Not a sound. We leave this room, go right, 30 feet to the back door and then out of here. - Don't stop for anything. - What about our stuff? I don't think your mom will miss the TV dinners. Let's go. Charlie? - That was nuts! - NICK: Totally! I've never been so scared in my life. What was that in there? A ghost! Tons of them! I don't know! We didn't exactly get a very good look at it. What was that fireball, or those red eyes or that scratching on the closet door? That wasn't the wind. What happens when we see Jake? We'll worry about that tomorrow. Tomorrow should be here in about two hours. Well, we'll come back then, wait for him, and win the bet. How do you figure that? Well, we took out all of Jake's cameras and stuff so now they won't have any idea that we're not in the house anymore. Let's go home, boys. Yeah. Hey, you coming or what? - I have to go back in there. - What are you talking about? I left my jacket. I have to go back in there and get it. It's just a jacket, Alex. I can't leave it. Who knows what'll happen to it? Well, whatever happens to it is going to happen to you too. - I mean, maybe when it's light- - I'm not asking you to come. What's the problem? Alex wants to go back in there and get his raggedy old jacket. It's my good-luck jacket. I'm not leaving without it. Look, what is it with that jacket, Alex? It's special. It's falling apart. Okay? You wear it every single day. It's my brother's, Charlie. He's deployed overseas. We don't get to hear from him. Half the time, we don't even know where he is. So as long as I'm wearing that jacket, I know he's safe. I'm going. Alex. Come on. Alex, wait up. What are you guys doing? We're in this together, remember? Friends till the end. Yeah. Don't sound so excited, goggles. Let's just get your jacket and get out of here. Do you remember where you left it? It should be right next to my sleeping bag, unless that thing got its claws on it. All quiet. Let's go. Hey, Charlie? Thanks for coming back for me. Those things won't do you any good against a ghost. How do you know? BOTH: Good point. - ALEX: It's not here! - What do you mean it's not here? - You sure this is where you left it? - I'm sure. Hurry up, guys! Come on, let's go! At least your flashlight still works. It's not showing another rerun, is it? Man, I'd really like to know how that thing turned off and on all by itself. Yeah! Or where that fireball came from. And those eyes! Maybe we didn't find it all. Jake's stuff, I mean! Maybe there's still more. Come on, Alex! Hurry up, let's go. I'm not leaving here without my jacket. Then maybe we should each split up and take a room. Have you ever actually seen a war movie, Charlie? No way! I'm staying with you and that flashlight. Then come on. Ahh! Another ghost! Wait a second. You can open your eyes now, Rambo. Oh. There it is! My jacket. You sure you didn't drop it when we ran out of here? Yeah, I'm sure. Then how did it get there? Guys, we walked right by here when we came back in. It wasn't there. We would have seen it. Maybe we just missed it. Or maybe something put it there after we ran in, meaning whatever it is, it's still in the house with us. You got a better explanation? Come on, Charlie. Let's just get the heck out of this spooky old dump! I think you made the spooky old dump mad. Come on! Try one of the windows! I can't get it off! Just stay calm! They're trying to scare us again. Yeah? Well, they're doing a pretty good job of it. Just stay close and don't move. We'll be fine as long as we cover each other's backs. Charlie, you may want to reconsider that whole "don't move" thing. There are those eyes again. My mom's gonna kill me. Come on! Let us out of here! I'll even give you my cactus jack knife if you want! Just leave us alone! - Alex! - Something's got my foot! - What is it? - How should I know? Help me, Charlie! Do something! You guys? Alex, can you hear me? Hang on! I told you we shouldn't have come back in here. - Just help me, will you? - In fact, we never even should have come here in the first place. This is all your fault, Charlie. I should be home right now eating Halloween candy 'til I puke. But no! You had to take that stupid dare. It's not the time, Nick! Alex is in trouble. In case you hadn't noticed, so are we! ALEX: Charlie, you guys! Help! Snap out of it! That thing out there has our friend, and he needs our help! Now help me with the door. "this job definitely isn't worth eleven five a year." "Ghostbusters"? You are so weird. Remind me again why we're doing this. So I can see the look on my brother's face when Charlie and his friends walk out of that house. What makes you so sure they actually stayed the night? They're not exactly the bravest bunch of seventh graders I've ever seen. Because I know Charlie. He's sweet and he always sticks to his word. Be quiet and don't wake up my parents. Alex? Can you hear me? Where are you? Ooh! Holy smokes. Charlie, check it out. The sun's finally up. Will you get back? You think they're still in there? JAKE: Would you be? - Alex, are you in there? - ALEX: Yeah, I'm in here. But you won't believe what I'm looking at. Check, please. Okay, new plan- we go home, forget this night ever happened, and start looking for a new best friend. Was that- Salty. The Sullivan Gang's dog? Didn't he rip people to shreds who crossed the gang? - Shut up, Nick! - Well, that's what the story said. Alex, can you move? It won't let me. We've got to do something. I got an idea! Uh... fetch, doggie. Well, it was worth a try! We need a diversion. We need something that will give us enough time to get Alex out of there. Uh, give me a phone. I'll call in an air strike! I've got an idea! Coffee. I don't think I can do this, Charlie. Whatever happened to "Rangers never retreat," tempting fate and all that stuff? Whatever happened to "live to see 14"? This has got to be the dumbest thing I've ever done. Nope, it's the bravest. Come on. ALEX: You guys! Ahh! - Are you okay? - I think so. Ahh! NICK: Charlie! Come on! Hey! CHARLIE: Over here! Get away from me! Sit! Charlie! Easy, boy. It's not working, Charlie! Sit! That's it. Good boy. What's he doing? He's a dog. A dog needs a friend. Attaboy. Awesome. See that? We didn't mean you any harm. Man's best friend, right? Let's just get out stuff and get out of here. Don't forget your Ranger knife, goggles. Just in case. You think that thing was really a ghost? There's no such thing as ghosts, remember? Besides, who'd believe us anyway? This was the craziest adventure we've ever had. Yeah, and the coolest. What are we going to tell everybody at school? Nothing. It was a piece of cake. Hey, I've got an idea. ALEX: No more bets, please. This will be even better. So we spread the word around that if we, the lowly geek squad, can spend the night in this place, that Jake and his friends shouldn't be afraid to do it either. Yeah, I heard Jake's a dog person. Do you think it'll let us out? Uh... uh-oh, Charlie. It's your dad. Todd must've squealed. What are you going to tell him? The truth, I guess. Well, most of it anyway. Time to face the music. Morning, fellas. Hey, dad. BOTH: Morning, Mr. Hamilton. So how was your study group last night? I'm really sorry. It's kind of a long story. I know. I heard the whole thing. Todd! It wasn't me this time, I swear. For once, he's actually telling the truth. Your friend Brandy came over last night. - She told me the whole story. - She came to our house? Yeah. Personally, I think she has a crush on me. But don't worry, Charlie. I'll let her down easy. - Todd. - What? Oh yeah, right, sorry. She's a nice girl, Charlie. I'm sorry that I lied to you, dad. Sorry about the whole thing. I know, and you're grounded for lying, kiddo. And I'm sure you guys are too once your parents find out. BOTH: Yes, Mr. Hamilton. But I'm proud of you too. Thanks, dad. You boys must have had quite an experience in there last night, huh? Nothing we couldn't handle. All right, let's go, boys. Let's get you home. Come on. Hey, uh, do you mind if we walk? I'll come straight home, I promise. All right, but straight home. All right? Let's go. Sorry, bro. Wow, I must be hearing things. We can discuss the matter of my $25 later. Todd! Van now. Oh yeah, and if your mom asks, you tell her I got real angry and I couldn't stop yelling, just like I always do, all right? It's our secret, dad. All right. You know, since you're in such a forgiving mood, Russ, there's this letter that got sent home with me from school that I've been meaning to talk to you about. - Todd? - Yeah? Shut up. Wow, your dad's full of surprises. Yeah, seems to be the night for it. Hi, Charlie. Hey. What are you guys doing here? She's waiting for you, stupid. I told your dad. I'm so sorry. It's okay. He was actually kind of cool about it. I was just worried. About me? No, I mean, about us? - I mean, you were- - Well, I was. - Um, I mean, like- - this is so stupid. Look, you like her, she likes you. Just say it already. Angela! You're the one they always call "goggles," right? Yeah. You're actually kind of cute without your glasses. JACK: Hey, brainiac! I never said I couldn't catch a football. You did. You guys actually stuck it out, huh? Yeah. That was the bet, right? And it's "Charlie," not brainiac or dork or geek-boy! - Yeah. - Hey, shut up, Brent. I'll remember that. Come on, guys. See you around, Charlie. NICK: I can't believe it. - He actually seemed- - Nice. I was going to say "Magnanimous." but then I thought he might hear me and come back and do that hitting-us-on-every-syllable thing again. Let's just go home. Who's this? - I don't know. - Does he have a tag? - What's his name? - I don't see one. How about "Salty"? He sure acts like he knows you, Charlie. He's so cute! What a good boy. Can we go home now, please? Come on, boy. Thanks for coming back for me. Uh, Charlie sort of made me do it. Boy, when that old TV came on by itself... or that fireball. Man! That was the ugliest ghost I've ever seen. Dude, that was the only ghost you've ever seen. What are they talking about? Just an old ghost story. What did he mean when he said, "thanks for coming back for me"? Tell me, Charlie. Really. Did something happen in that house last night? Yeah. I learned who my real friends are. And I don't care what Jake or any of his friends or anyone else says. I'm Charlie Hamilton and I like math and science and "D&D" and old monster movies. And I think that's pretty cool. So do I. Well, anyway, it must have been pretty exciting. Are you going to keep him? Sure. Unless someone else comes to get him. CHARLIE: Good boy, come on! Come on!
