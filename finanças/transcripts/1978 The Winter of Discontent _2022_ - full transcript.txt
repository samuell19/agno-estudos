A nation crippled by strikes... CHANTING ..rocketing prices... Inflation in the United Kingdom was running at over 8%. ..and a cost of living crisis. You had people who were literally starving. If you didn't have money to buy bread or to buy food or to buy meat, you just didn't eat. You'd think it was 2022, but it was the winter of 1978. The Government looks set to stick to 5%. What's your reaction? With the worst weather in a decade... It was so cold that I grew a beard. ..13 million days were lost to strikes. There was a terrible inevitability of strikes. It takes on the feeling of a tidal wave coming towards you. Thousands of schools were closed. Hospitals were only admitting emergency patients and we couldn't even bury the dead. We went from a civilised society to a totally uncivilised society. It was like Lord of the Flies writ large. But whilst the country spun out of control, Labour PM James Callaghan was on holiday in the Caribbean. When the country is falling apart, maybe not the brightest thing. Please don't run down your country by talking about mounting chaos. Although disco offered some escape and our favourite TV shows reflected the mood of the nation... Taxpayers pay them millions each year, they get the money, go on strike. The country was not only hungry for change, but was really ready for a change. It now seems quite clear that the government has no conscience, no shame, no honour, no morality. It was a cry from the heart of the nation for somebody to do something. REPORTER: Are you claiming victory yet? MARGARET THATCHER: Going nicely. ..told by the people who survived it. This is the story of seven bleak months of industrial chaos that changed Britain forever. The Winter of Discontent. In July, 1978, inflation was running high and wages were at rock-bottom. Even now, I can remember there wasn't a lot of money around and people genuinely were struggling to make ends meet against prices that were rocketing. I don't think there's ever been a time as long as I've been alive as that year and the years previous to that. There were tough. PUNK ROCK MUSIC PLAYS Looking back over 40 years, the '70s can seem like a blur of strikes, blackouts and rampant inflation. After winning the 1970 election, new Conservative PM Ted Heath became locked in a fierce battle with the miners. There was no meeting of minds and we got so used to strikes, but they were so destructive. In 1973, as coal shortages threatened the energy supply, Heath imposed a three-day week. Ordinary Britons were told just to heat one room and keep the lights off. Even the cabinet met by candlelight. After Labour won the 1974 election, inflation was high and wages rose slowly through the decade. And by the summer of 1978, food prices and electricity bills had doubled. There weren't food banks back then. If you didn't have money to buy bread or to buy food or to buy meat, you just didn't eat. I lived in a mining village and I saw poverty at its very worst. By 1978, you still had all of those economic problems in place of declining productivity and very, very high inflation. You also have a government hanging on by the skin of its teeth. The Labour government's solution was deeply unpopular - a 5% cap on pay rises. When that 5% pay ceiling came in, in '78, it was like a red rag to a bull. We had rampant inflation. We had lots of unemployment, and it was a very tough time. But Brits were escaping their troubles on the dance floor, where box office sensation Saturday Night Fever had brought disco to the masses and made John Travolta a star. John Travolta was the sexiest thing anyone had ever seen. He was every dance character you've ever heard of, all rolled into one. He did it better. He was just remarkable. Brits took to the floor to dance their troubles away. Suddenly, everyone from your mates to your dad was channelling their inner-Travolta. There was a fantastic nightclub opened in Newcastle called Tuxedo Junction. And I was there, you know, every other night. It was buzzing. Things were happening. You were wearing clothes you wouldn't be seen dead in now. You know, absolutely awful. The clothes were crazy back then, it was bell-bottoms and platforms and hot pants and chokers and headbands and feathered hair. Never out of fashion was the 30p pint. Even I would have bought a round in those days. Saturday Night Fever was the sound of the summer, but in Brighton, election fever was the talk of the town. Everybody was expecting Sunny Jim Callaghan to call an election. He was popular. He would have probably won. On the 5th of September, when Prime Minister James Callaghan arrived at the Trades Union Congress, he was two years into the job and ahead in the polls. I say to you that if you accept 5% in so far as other factors remain constant, then inflation will probably be lower by the end of 1979 than it is today. On the other hand, exert your muscle, secure... But the PM delayed the election until the following year. He'd gone through every seat and looked at it and thought, "Can we win that? Can we not? "Can we win that? Can...?" And at the end, he'd toted up and couldn't see a majority. Callahan believed this postponement would allow the economy to recover and secure him a majority. # There was I, waiting at the church. # # There was I, waiting at the church. # Before my time. Definitely before my time. Instead of announcing an election, Callahan sang an old musical number called Waiting at the Church. There they are in Brighton, waiting to hear about an election and Sunny Jim starts singing... # There was I waiting at the church. # And they think Boris is barking. # Can't get away to marry you today # My wife won't let me. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Jim Callahan's singing voice was probably comparable with mine. I was put into the junior choir at grammar school, but I was there to fill a gap on the back row. He was filling a gap, wasn't he? People were amazed, you know, his people, his cabinet, the people who advised him were amazed. They couldn't understand, they were thinking, you know, "go to the people now." But he waited. Two days after his sing-song, Callahan confirmed his decision to go to the country. I shall not be calling for a general election at this time. Instead, I ask every one of you to carry on with the task of consolidating the improvement now taking place in our country's position. Let's see it through together. I said, "Prime Minister, there's only two places for you in history. "One is the man who missed the boat, "and the other is a political genius." Jim Callaghan wasn't arrogant to postpone the general election. He was desperate and the party could not be at all confident of winning a general election. And so you postpone and you hope that something will turn up. There you are. There you are. All right. Little did Callahan know that the country was about to slide into the abyss. And it all began on the 23rd of September at the Ford factory in Dagenham. There was a real sense of tension in the air. It's going to be a strike, isn't it? It's going to be a strike. The workforce of one of the country's biggest car manufacturers was about to kick-start the Winter of Discontent. We were sat in a canteen chanting and people started banging the tables and shouting, "Out, out, out!" 57,000 workers in 23 of its factories downed tools and walked out, demanding an enormous 30% pay rise. I thought it was kind of outrageous at the time. I thought "they'll never get that." They asked for a 35 hour working week and they asked for 20 quid a week pay rise. So when we say now 20 quid a week pay rise, it sounds like nothing, but actually, back then it represented a massive pay rise. Ford workers were the first to make their voices heard. But they wouldn't be the last. There was a terrible sort of inevitability of strikes. I begin to feel as the news gets bad now that it's almost too much to bear. # Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-doo # Took her bowling in the arcade... # It's September 1978. Grease is grossing record profits for a movie musical in cinemas nationwide, as its portrayal of teenage romance in an LA high school in the '50s provided everyone with that nostalgic feel. Grease took over the teenage imagination. Everybody wanted to be either Travolta or Olivia Newton-John, or preferably both. All the boys fell in love with Sandy. All the girls fell in love with Danny. If they weren't glued to Grease, Brits were hooked on Space Invaders and wolfing down Angel Delight. # Mums, delight your family with # The softest, smoothest taste there is # It's delicious It's de-lovely # It's Angel Delight. # Angel Delight was just one of the many time-saving gastronomic treats. Just add milk to the powder and in an instant, you had a delicious dessert for the whole family. Bird's Angel Delight. It's delicious. But with prices for many products on the rise and pay not keeping up with inflation, the public were getting restless. People's wages were just shrivelling into nothing in the face of rampant inflation. Just nine days after Grease premiered, the mood music changed. On the 26th of September, 57,000 of Ford workers, like Steve Hart, XX had gone on strike. PROTEST MUSIC PLAYS I'm looking through boxes in my attic and I came across this record. The strikers at one of Britain's largest car manufacturers were singing a different tune. Unfair pay and conditions. And in fact, they made a record. # You can stop your 5% # Cos that won't pay the rent # And it's five, six, seven bigger than the factory gates # It's one in the eye for Sunny Jim # Whoopie, we're gonna win. # I haven't listened to it probably since 1978. I think it cost a pound. So that was one sixth of my strike pay for a week, so it's quite a lot of money. In 1978, Ford's pre-tax British profits had doubled to 246 million... ..and the strikers wanted what they believed was their fair share, a 30% pay rise. We made every penny of those profits. We wanted some of that back cos that gave us better living standards. Simple. Driving Ford's huge profits in the '70s was Britain's best selling car, the Cortina. ARCHIVE: Its wider, lower, sleeker, smoother, quieter, faster. Slick adverts like this helped broaden the appeal of this humble family saloon. It featured a Cortina cruising easily uphill around hairpin bends, transporting the whole family up into the mountains. The Cortina was the one that I remember as being sort of really iconic through that period. It just seemed to speak to Britain. But despite the Cortina's success, Ford workers weren't celebrating. They were struggling. We got £6 a week strike pay. I think the pay was not far off £100 a week then, so £6 a week was not a lot. It's very, very difficult to survive on that. Many strikers got help from their families, but for 26-year-old Steve, popping round to mum's for tea wasn't an easy option. My mother was a member of the government. She was Minister of Overseas Development. She was part of a government whose wage restraint policy I personally had been on strike to break through. We did have discussions about it. I think I went over for a meal when I got particularly hungry during the strike, but it was quite a difficult period for me. It was also difficult for Jim Callaghan's Labour government. To control inflation, Callaghan had imposed a 5% cap on pay rises. The Ford dispute was its first major test. Economically, it was utter nonsense. And if you had industrial muscle like the Ford workers, you could just throw it out the window, which is what they did. There is sufficient feeling among the Ford workers that the company's offer is not only derisory, it's insulting. The government looks set to stick to 5%. What's your reaction now? 5% pay increase when inflation is 9 or 10% is a 5% pay cut. British workers asking for fair pay was a familiar demand throughout the '70s, as unions had become more powerful than ever. By the time of the 1970s, the trade union movement had more power, more influence, more direct contact with government than any time in its history. I think it's very difficult for people today, some of whom weren't even born at this time, to understand the fear of the power of the trade union movement. It was genuine. The trade unions were increasingly aware of the power that they had. And, of course, inflation gave them a very good argument for their wage demands. But I think when the union starts making crazy demands, when you paralyse your country, all of your country, it's crazy. On October 6th, just a fortnight into the Ford strike, the Sun reflected the national fear of the nightmare ahead by predicting it would be a "Winter of Discontent." Six weeks after Ford workers went on strike, on the 7th of November, with 26,000 bakers on strike, there were angry scenes as strikers scuffled with police when a bread lorry tried to leave Sunblest, the country's leading bakery. CHANTING With the supply of baked goods cut by 70%, there was panic buying and huge queues at bakeries across Britain. My mum, she put me in the queue, you know. And she used to say to me don't let anyone push you out the way. If they do, push them back. Chaos. There's people all over the place. Queues miles long. Just like with Ford, workers wanted what they believed was a fair slice of the pie, with the bakers union demanding a 26% pay rise. What are you doing today? Just supervising the crowds. Making sure everything's all right, you know. What sort of things do they say to you? Well, last one, somebody threatened to smack me across the face. Because there was there was violence in these queues, there was people pushing and shoving, and there were people attacking the bread vans as they were coming into the supermarkets and the shops. But there was one sure-fire way to avoid the shortages. Huge bread strike. So what happens? Everybody's baking their own. So I started making bread as well. I got some yeast and although it was edible, it did lie pretty heavy in the stomach. You needed a good drink to go with it. The strikes divided Britain straight down the middle. All those in favour, please show. In 1978, half the workers were union members... Those against? ..but half of them were not. There was a feeling of, "I'm all right, Jack." That phrase was used an awful lot about trade union and trade union workers. "I'm all right, Jack." A feeling of those people who could get away with it, holding the rest of the country to ransom, in a way that was almost immoral. It does get quite depressing, doesn't it? When you can see a battleground opening up, you can see people who feel that their wages have not kept up with the cost of living. And you feel the employers saying, "Yeah, but you will make things worse "if we have to spend more on our wages "and the cost of everything will go up." And it takes on the feeling of a of a tidal wave coming towards you. Many British people resented the fall in living standards caused by Callaghan's wages policy. This simmering anger was picked up in popular culture. One of Britain's best loved TV shows at the time... Good morning, breakfast. ..was Fawlty Towers. In this clip... Breakfast. ..John Cleese's Basil Fawlty is moaning about striking car workers. Here we are. Another car strike. Marvellous, isn't it? Taxpayers pay them millions each year, they get the money, go on strike. It's called socialism. If they don't like making cars, why don't they get themselves another bloody job designing cathedrals or composing violin concertos? The British Leyland Concerto in four movements, all of them slow, with a four hour tea break in between. I'll tell you why. Because they're not interested in anything except lounging about and conveyor belts, stuffing themselves with my money. You don't mind if I turn the light off? Well, enjoy your breakfast. Basil's rants about the state of the nation helped Fawlty Towers become one of the highest rating sitcoms of the day. Oh, not at all. Thank you for mentioning it. It's just a shame that on this occasion... ..he was preaching to deaf ears. The Ford strike continued for nine long weeks. Their stands at October's Birmingham Motor Show were embarrassingly empty. And the strike was costing Ford 10 million a day. It couldn't continue. By late November, Ford's bosses were forced to settle on a huge 17% deal, smashing the government's 5% cap. Ford workers were the big winner. We now went back to work with 17% increase in wages. 12% more than when we went out. So that was a big increase. That was real money, a real increase in your next wage packet. The Ford strike identified a real line of tension, and that was that other workers, particularly in the public sector, thought, "If you go on strike, you get what you want. "That's what the Ford workers did. "That's what we should do.". After Ford got their 17% pay rise, it opened the floodgates to everyone across the country. And people were asking for 40% pay rise. You know, we're baulking at the railroad workers now are thinking how impossible and unrealistic that is. But imagine asking for a 40% pay rise. Whilst November was a good month for Ford workers, it wasn't a good month for the weather. And worse still, in December, you couldn't even stay in and watch TV. We thought we might have no telly on Christmas Day. Well, in my house, that would have been a catastrophe. In December 1978, snow storms from Scandinavia swept in the coldest winter in years. I remember opening our front door one day and there was just a wall of snow in front of me. And, you know, it's interesting, isn't it? People now don't leave their houses if the weather's like that. Back then we had no choice. NEWS REPORT: At times, driving winds and snow created white out conditions. Gritting operation kept the main A1 road open. There were definite signs that we were starting to see real problems ahead. At Westminster, the wintry weather signalled a dire change of fortunes for Callaghan's Labour government. On December the 13th, Callaghan's plan to sanction firms like Ford, who broke the 5% pay deal, was defeated in the Commons. His wages policy was in tatters. Labour wanted to enforce this 5%, telling companies, post Ford, that if you do it, we're coming for you. There will be sanctions. And the Tories, obviously pro-business, pro free enterprise even then said, "no, you cannot do that.", and they won the day. So the trade unions right across the spectrum thought, "OK, fine, we've got an open door to this. "Government can't do anything about it." With more strikes looming, the snow howling outside and Christmas fast approaching, the telly was about the only thing weary Britons could rely on. Until even that joy was threatened. So there's talk about everybody going on strike, and now we're all at home watching telly and the BBC's talking about going on strike as well. We thought we might have no telly on Christmas Day. Well, in my house that would have been a catastrophe because there was only made me mam and me dad and I don't know what I'd have done if there'd been no telly. There was a long-standing impasse between the Beeb and the unions. BBC bosses acknowledged that pay lagged behind their commercial rivals, but its hands were tied by the government's 5% cap and an overtime ban by the Broadcasting Union. The unions were making life very difficult for us to make programmes. And I was a trade unionist and I believe in trade unions, but I could see that they were making demands that were... ..almost impossible. The BBC, in those days were very, very careful with their money, and I was never paid £100 for doing Top Of The Pops, even though it had about 15 million viewers. I think I got paid about 90 quid, and afterwards, to earn some decent money, I used to do a disco at a pub in the old Kent Road. It wasn't just a question of, of the money they were asking. It was also a question of the rules they were imposing. You know, if you picked up a stool and moved it a foot, the whole studio might come out on strike. It was a very, very unpleasant atmosphere and I couldn't see a way out of it. There were great fears that they would be off air for Christmas. And of course, you had all the big shows which were planned for Christmas. So everybody was extremely worried about that. We used to get the TV Times and the Radio Times and you'd get the week's programmes ahead so you'd plan what you were going to do over Christmas with the family, what you were going to watch and everything. And then, and that was just thrown into chaos. Two days before Christmas, telly addicts' worst fears were realised. After the BBC failed to secure a pay deal with its staff, BBC One and Two went off air on December the 21st and 22nd. So on Friday the 22nd of December 1978, on Radio 2 at 4:00 in the afternoon, I had to read out this message. "We regret to inform you that because of industrial action, "we have to leave our advertised..." RECORDING: ..programmes at this junction. From now, until further notice, BBC Radios One, Two, Three and Four will combine to bring you an all-network radio service. The all-network radio service meant all four of the BBC's very different radio stations were merged into one very strange Christmas radio pudding. Auntie Beeb was also planning a makeshift service of pre-recorded shows. Noel Edmonds couldn't film Top Of The Pops in its studio, Noel Edmonds couldn't film and the tape of the Queen's Message was locked in a safe. We waited all year to see the Queen do that speech, and it was tradition. And, you know, we could all stand having no money, but we couldn't stand our traditions being trashed. Fortunately, at the 11th hour, a 15% pay deal meant the sacred Christmas schedule was saved. Luckily, at the last minute, a deal was struck and my show survived on Christmas Day and so did the rest of the Christmas schedule. So it was business as usual at the Beeb. Phew. Thankfully, the BBC strike was resolved for Christmas Day. It was still pretty chilly, but Britain's families were warmed up by Mike Yarwood's Christmas show. He reflected the attitude of a nation by sending up the PM. DOOR RATTLES LAUGHTER Go away, I'm not coming out. It's taken me a lifetime to get into this place. As long as I'm here, I intend to stay. Why do you think you're still waiting for a general election? Hah. Mike Yarwood was such a brilliant impressionist, and I think he had Sunny Jim off to a T. He was brilliant. He could do anything as somebody else. It's the most wonderful gift to have. The other stars of Yearwood's Christmas Day hit were the world's most successful pop group, Abba, who also brought us some festive cheer. # For giving it to me... # The country had lost just over 5 million days to strikes, and with inflation at 7%, the economy was struggling. But at least on Christmas Day, we had, as ABBA rightly say, the music. And for that, we were thankful. BIG BEN CHIMES MUSIC: Auld Lang Syne As Big Ben welcomed in 1979, New Year's Eve was a rare opportunity for the British people to forget all about the Winter of Discontent. New Year's Eve I was doing a disco. And the strange thing is that although it was so cold and everybody was depressed, nonetheless, the clubs were full. We went out and had a great time. On the dance floor, Rod Stewart was asking, Do you think I'm sexy? And Ian Drury wanted people to hit me with your rhythm stick. We felt that we had turned the corner from the bad times and the music was keeping us cheerful and bright and happy. And then... ..we were hit by this winter with the most dreadful weather. The new year blew in a raging snowstorm. We had snow, we had storms. It was awful. So New Year's Day was one of the snowiest on record. We were looking at temperatures not getting above freezing over the bulk of the country. This was tough and it was going to be tough for people trying to get back to work after Christmas. I had to drive back through a blizzard to get back for the show at 10:00 in the morning on Radio 2. But being an old pro, I made it. But just as the hangovers wore off, Britain was immediately confronted by another strike. We wanted to earn a decent living and put food on the table. People said to themselves, "Enough's enough.". On the third of January, members of the Transport Union, the TGWU, went on strike. Thousands of lorry drivers joined picket lines around the country, holding out for a 30% wage increase. No-one likes to go on strike. It's the last resort. Once your boss says, "No, we're not paying you what you deserve.", what do you do? With most British goods transported by road, the country immediately began to grind to a halt. The lorry drivers' strike was really profound because it was about the supply chain. So lorries bringing goods in for export were stopped by the picket line and stuff that had arrived on great big ships couldn't get out. So if you switch the lorries off, you switch half the economy off. Only essential goods were allowed through the lorry drivers' picket lines. Well, we'll let anything out that's essential. Anything that isn't essential just stays in. But you're deciding that. Well, the union's deciding it. The punch was felt first at the petrol pump as garages around the country quickly began to run dry. Queues for petrol turned into giant tailbacks. In the supermarkets, nationwide panic buying set in within days. ..tins. I bought butter, bacon. I bought extra of every little thing, really. And a couple of tins of vegetables, which I never buy, just in case. I think the thing about panic buying is that you don't really have to do it if you act sensibly, but when you're terrified you're not going to get food, you don't act sensibly. This supermarket warehouse is normally packed floor to ceiling with groceries. Today, it's half empty and according to Tesco's chairman, it's going to get a lot emptier. I think that possibly the army should be brought in in order to drive the vehicles and get us all the supplies of food we need. As Britain's supermarket shelves lay bare, Brits were forced to rely on their community spirit. My mum, who was incredible, if she knew someone was really struggling and literally didn't have anything, she would take some of our food 'round. There was a great sense of community. It's like the wartime spirit. Where things are absolutely awful, it sort of brings out the best in everybody and we all get together. We say, "Come on, you know, we'll get through it.". My mum used to make big pans of soup because it was cheap and it was filling and you didn't have to go and queue to get it. And we grew veg not because we were organic or because we were trying to do the right thing to save the planet. It's because it was cheap. The British people dug deep, but the bad weather was relentless. There were all sorts of problems by this point. We're getting heavy falls of snow, particularly up around Yorkshire, Derbyshire and also around the borders of Scotland. It was very, very badly hit there. We're looking down a very long tunnel. You couldn't see the light at the end of it. The Army prepared to help by calling back 9,000 troops from Christmas leave. They were trained to drive lorries and man the petrol pumps. We had the harshest winter. And yet trucks weren't working. People couldn't get to work. People couldn't feed themselves, couldn't feed their families. It was a nightmare. The rash of strikes, the chaos to which Britain was reduced by the trade union leadership pushed me pretty much to the right. I think I just shared the whole Conservative Party's, and many Conservative voters horror at what was going on and also a sense of moral disapproval of what the trade union movement seemed to be up to. As the country froze and the lorry strike crippled the nation, Britain was on the brink of a national emergency. There was one question on everyone's lips - "What is the PM doing?". But "Sunny" Jim Callaghan was in the Caribbean. On the fourth of January 1978, British Prime Minister James Callaghan had travelled to the tropical island paradise of Guadeloupe for a nuclear conference with the leaders of the Western world. After the talks, the PM and his team flew to Barbados for a quick holiday where a paparazzi photographer was waiting for them. At the peak of the winter of discontent, loads of people on strike, and where is Sunny Jim? He's sunning himself in the Caribbean. Everybody was wondering, what country was he in. I was thinking, what planet is he on? Neither of us are particularly flattered by the photograph, but we were mystified because we had not been conscious of any photographers. It really did hack people off when that photograph appeared of Callaghan in the Caribbean in his big baggy shorts. Everyone's entitled to a holiday. Even prime ministers are entitled to a holiday. But when the country is falling apart, you've got a Winter of Discontent, you've got strikes. That was a profound mistake. It showed that he had... ..hellish misjudgement. And it also showed he had absolutely no idea of what was happening to people, of how people were suffering. As the public anger grew towards "Sunny" Jim and the press gathered at Heathrow, Tom believed it was the ideal opportunity for the PM to prove he had everything under control. I said, "I think you should get off the plane, "say to them, 'Look, I'm back. "'We've been doing important things, but we've got an important challenge "'ahead of us. I'm in charge.'". REPORTER: What is your general approach and view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment? Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside and perhaps you're taking a rather parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos. I'm over his shoulder standing, and if you look in my face, you can see because he'd gone off message and there was nothing I could do about it except, you know, think this is a disaster, which it was. Please don't run down your country by talking about mounting chaos. Idiot. That's a smack in the face to every person who had looked at their purse at the end of the week and got no money and didn't know if they could eat or not. And of course, the Sun next day encapsulated it as "Crisis? What crisis?". He never did say that, but he got bloody close to it. He was a Labour Prime Minister, for God's sake. You know, he should have understood more about the people who had voted for him, but he didn't. The mass media, television, print, the whole lot, had simply taken against him. And there was no way that he could have climbed out of it and said, "Hey, guys, you know, I'm back and I'm in charge "and it's all going to be hunky dory.". They were having none of it and he played into their hands. And it was almost a tragedy unfolding before our very eyes. The response within the Conservative Party to the whole Barbados imbroglio was just amazing joy. I mean, we were just so happy to see himself get into really what was a fairly self-inflicted mess of that kind. The party didn't need to say very much. Of course, there were plenty of jibes against him and all the rest, but on the whole, we left it to the Sun, and the Sun did a pretty good job. Don't leave the country during a crisis. That is THE lesson. After Callaghan was hauled over the coals by the British press, there was little sign of an agreement between the lorry drivers and their bosses. The country needed a reassuring voice. But a week after returning from the Caribbean, "Sunny" Jim had still not addressed the crisis facing the nation. What I think of James Callaghan I don't actually think of someone particularly charismatic. He made a thing about being boring. To come up against wide-scale strikes, the like of which had not been seen for quite some time, you needed a figure of great potency, great intellect, and great clarity. And I don't think Jim had any of those. They were backed into a corner, the whole Labour government. But confrontation would almost certainly have failed. So their only hope was to carry on trying to give the impression that at least a Labour government has a strong working relationship with trade unionism. And while Callaghan had nowhere to go, waiting in the wings, his nemesis used the opportunity to seize her moment. She did what probably any sensible party of opposition does when the government is falling apart, which is just to let it fall apart. It was the most wonderful thing that could have happened to Margaret Thatcher. She made hay out of it, of course. On the 17th of January. Thatcher did what Callaghan couldn't. She called a crisis a crisis. Mr Chairman, even the Prime Minister's concluded that our troubles are serious. A full, long, anxious week after he told us that it was unpatriotic to talk of mounting chaos. She felt the need to make it clear that there was a crisis, that his fingerprints and his government's fingerprints were all over it. Thatcher made us believe that anything was possible. She was way cleverer than any of them, that's the problem. And she had been getting ready for a very long time. You didn't telling there was a crisis as you saw the sick and the elderly made the victims of heartless action. What sort of society is this which breeds such selfish callousness? But as Thatcher intelligently savaged Callaghan's government, even she couldn't be prepared for the horrors to come. Early January, 1979 was one of the coldest winters since records began. The lorry strike had choked the country's supply of food and fuel, and inflation was still rising. Then on Monday, January the 22nd, Britain went into total meltdown. 1.5 million public sector workers went on strike... ..and took to the streets to demand fair pay. When the public sector went out, I mean, that's when it really hit everyone. You had the private workers wanting big pay rises against big inflation and the public sector workers wanting equally good pay rises and a government that simply said, "No, you can't have it.". It added to the divisions within society. Public sector workers from all over the country will be down picketing the House of Commons and lobbying their MPs. It was, you know, every section in local government. It was clerical staff, to road workers, for refuse, gravediggers, carers. And in the health service, it was, you know, porters, cleaners, catering, nurses, administrative staff. You know, the full gamma. It was Britain's biggest day of strike action for half a century. This is a definite statement. It's only the beginning. We just can't possibly continue the present arrangement whereby we get the dirty end of the stick every time. It was a struggle of working class people for better pay, better conditions... ..and a way of life, which, you know, they didn't have to struggle every single month when they got the pay cheque. In 1979, the average public sector worker earned as little as £49 a week before tax. That's £300 in today's money, less than the minimum wage. The public sector wanted a minimum of £60 per week, which for some would mean an increase of up to 40%. You can see how a government is thinking, "Where's the money going to come from to give "12, 15, 16% pay rises?". PROTESTORS CHANT As thousands of strikers marched on Westminster, thousands more made their voices heard across the country. It was a carnival atmosphere. People thought, "Well, you know, if we can do this on one particular "day, maybe we can do it on a couple of other days as well.". You know, it's not just a one-off. The impact of the biggest disruption to public services since the general strike of 1926 was unprecedented. Schools were closed, rubbish began piling up in the streets and hospitals ran a skeleton staff. And it does remind you how crucial the people are who keep society going. Even the army were called in to drive ambulances. Not knowing the London area that well, I think we'll have slightly more problems than the ambulance men would have finding the right places. REPORTER: This is the Camden ambulance station, London's biggest, normally handling 200 emergency calls a day. Today, the 76 ambulance men were on the picket line. Their vehicles stayed in the garage. The strikers called it a day of action, but it instantly became known by another name. The 22nd of January is always a miserable day, and in '79 it was called Misery Monday. Misery Monday wasn't all bad news. Striking tollbooth workers meant people could drive thru for free. But just as roads were left ungritted, the bad weather returned. All hell let loose. We did see the coldest weather of the entire winter and that's when temperatures never got above about minus seven around Glasgow and some places in Strathclyde fell to -24. That was absolutely bitter. Even Brighton, down on the south coast of England, had seven days where the temperature never got above freezing. And that's really quite remarkable. Not only do we have these strikes, but we had the worst weather that we had for ages. It was so cold that I grew a beard, I couldn't be bothered shaving. And it also made me feel a little bit warmer. Well, it must've been absolutely perishing cold for people on the picket line. They must've been wondering whether they were doing the right thing. They were freezing to death while they were standing there. So it's a double-edged sword, isn't it, really? Hardship. You know, we don't know what hardship is these days, do we, compared with that? I mean, it was tough. It was very tough. They were there on the picket line for very good reasons. But at the same time, they didn't want to be frozen solid. On the 23rd of January, the harsh weather caused bedlam on Britain's transport network. There was a lot of snow lying on the ground as well. Let's not forget, the snow doesn't just come on one day and then disappear. Not in this country. 100,000 miles of roads were severely disrupted by the snow. Whenever it snows, we're never prepared for it, are we? We have all the warning signs and it all goes mad. Everything grinds to a halt. And there were 500 miles of jams on the outskirts of major cities. So the snow comes down heavily, it gets blown around. And, you know, you don't need to go far off the main arterial roads in this country, on the motorways, before you start to get into gridlock, really, on the small roads, the B-roads, the C-roads. At Heathrow and Gatwick, no planes were able to land. And the railways were in chaos, too. REPORTER: Commuters hoping for a day of normal travel were in for a shock when they arrived at their stations this morning. Services on southern region were virtually at a standstill, and by 8:00, only four trains had snaked their way into London, sparkling like firecrackers as the ice flew off the electric conductor tracks. As usual, British Rail had a novel way of blaming the weather. The "wrong kind of snow" became synonymous with British Rail because they were making all sorts of excuses about why the trains couldn't run. I can remember the wrong kind of snow. There was always the wrong kind of nature affecting railways, still does. You've got the wrong kind of sun now. Then you had the wrong kind of leaves on the line and certainly the wrong kind of snow. It's quite funny when the bosses say, "It's not the snow, "that's the problem, it's just it's the wrong kind of snow.", as if there's a rule about the kind of snow you have to have. Misery Monday was followed by weeks of strike mayhem. It had just sort of spiralled out of control, really, and it was just bringing the country to a halt. As well as a series of coordinated lightning strikes, many workers chose to stay off work indefinitely. Striking caretakers meant thousands of schools were closed. The cleaners and the dinner ladies and the caretakers do an excellent job for long hours and they do not get enough money for it. REPORTER: Are you worried about your children's education? No, not in the least. We don't actually have a case against the caretakers and their right to strike. But what we do think is that the teachers should go into the schools and there's no earthly reason to stop them. Mountains of rubbish were piling up across the country. All of the streets in Newcastle were piled high with bags and they were stinking. There was a stench everywhere you went and, you know, people get cross now if the binmen don't come every fortnight. Leicester Square became a makeshift dumping ground known as "Fester" Square. I remember the smell very, very, very clearly. People were appalled. And resentment towards the strikers began to take hold. REPORTER: And as the strikers freeze on the picket line, they're constantly reminded by a pile of dead rats of what one anonymous passer by thinks of them. And unless the rats are declared a health or fire risk, they'll have to stay where they are until the road sweepers go back to work. Cities just were rank. Rats everywhere. Sick of living in filth, people began to take matters into their own hands. I was standing for the local council election. We organised our own rubbish collection service. We took all the rubbish to the local tip. It was an interesting experience, not least I learnt from it how hard it is to be a dustman. It's, manually, absolutely exhausting. But as if the mountains of rotting rubbish and school closures were not bad enough, the unthinkable took place. A gravedigger strike in Liverpool caused a backlog of bodies in mortuaries. We don't want to be on strike, but the same with anybody else, we've got to live. I can't remember a trade union that ever refused to dig holes in the ground for dead people or bury them. But when that line was crossed, jaws dropped. I don't think the public had any sympathy or understanding why they'd want to do that, and why it might have been their brother or sister, mum or dad. It was a very, very bleak moment indeed. The City Council rented a disused factory to store 150 corpses. Imagine what that could do to the families of the people who had died. It was just awful, horrendous. Grieving families were forced to mourn unburied bodies. We've been really so distressed for not knowing what's going to happen or when the strike's going to end or anything. You know, you just don't know. We went from a sort of civilised society to a totally uncivilised society. It was like Lord of the Flies, you know, writ large. In January 1979, strikes by 1.5 million public sector workers plunged Britain into chaos. I believe in trade unions. I think, you know, workers need protection. But I also think that you need a balance. And what had happened around that time was that the unions were beginning to call strike after strike after strike. We used to meet as organisers every Monday to determine which particular group of workers in the public sector would take action. The most damaging strikes were by NHS workers. To get the publicity, you had to do something drastic and a nurse withdrawing their labour was something unheard of. A lot of people thought that nurses should never strike, ambulance drivers should never strike. It was, nevertheless, unsettling to see that section of the workforce that were thought of as sort of humanitarian, the people depended on for life and health and safety. Our trade union general secretaries walked out of that meeting in disgust... ..at the derisory offer. It was 8.8%. Can I see a show of hands of those in favour of going on strike immediately? UNION MEMBERS MURMUR By the end of January, hospitals were in chaos. Inside, volunteers stepped in to help with the cooking and cleaning. And outside, the picket lines meant nearly half the hospitals in the UK were only admitting emergency cases. Things came to a head on the 31st of January, when Labour Health Minister David Ennals visited a hospital in London's East End. The angry reception epitomised the growing frustration towards the government. Desperate for a distraction, 15 million viewers were taking comfort in a particular show airing on Saturday night on BBC One - That's Life. The news we were bringing to our viewers was not the political news or the international news. It was the news of what was happening in people's lives. It was a completely different agenda. With the country at a standstill and millions off work, TV viewing figures were going through the roof. The ratings began to climb and we were so busy we didn't really notice. But every now and then someone would say to me, "It's 15 million.". It was the big Saturday night hit of the late '70s, pairing comedy and consumer issues, which proved to be a winning combination. You are extremely kind. Thank you very much indeed. Good evening. We would like to thank everyone who's written to us again this week. The stories we told came from our viewers. Sometimes they were funny, sometimes they were tragic. Sometimes they were about wicked swindlers, sometimes they were about strange looking vegetables. But whatever they were, they came from our viewers' lives. I wanted to be Esther Rantzen because I kept on looking at her doing this show, thinking, "I want to be going into the streets "and talking to people and having fun with them and setting up pranks." I really wanted to be Esther Rantzen back then. It was a people show and of course she is now a national treasure. One particular moment that captured the hearts of the nation took place on the 18th of February. It is a funny word, sausages, if you think about it, and it's particularly funny if it's delivered by a Yorkshire terrier called Prince. Tell us what you have on a Thursday, Prince. What's your... Sau... What? Sau-sages. LAUGHTER Everybody who was alive at the time remembers the dog that said sausages or rather... MIMICS PRINCE: ..sau-sages. After we showed the film, everywhere I went, people shouted sausages at me. Sausages. Everybody kept their sense of humour. And perhaps it was more important than ever when the news was bad. By March, that news had gone from bad to worse. After five long months of strikes, picketing and shortages, the nation had reached breaking point. The plight of nurses, ladies and gentlemen, is a running sore on the conscience of the government. Except, of course, that it now seems quite clear that the government has no conscience, no shame, no honour, no morality. The feeling of discontent that was manifesting itself in a trade union movement, which, I suspect by this time, frightening the majority of the country. I couldn't see a way through the warfare, the battle battleground that had become the whole industrial scene, because there was a no meeting of mind. When every day it's getting worse and there just comes a point when you go enough. There was a sort of cry from the heart of the nation for somebody to do something. The new PM in waiting was hovering in the wings. This is what £1 will buy under Labour today. By late March, 1979, Britain was still being paralysed by strikes. The Winter of Discontent was dragging on into spring. Labour PM James Callaghan still couldn't curtail the power of the unions and he was becoming more and more unpopular. Callaghan was sort of losing it, really. It needed a completely new face. It needed new ideas. Callaghan was a dead man walking, wasn't he? And Thatcher was fresh and new. And we wanted her. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind, all these years on, that in '79, the country was not only hungry for change, but was really ready for a change. Tory leader Margaret Thatcher believed she was the right person to help the country leave the dark days of winter behind. On the 28th of March, she seized her opportunity to bring down the government by calling a vote of no confidence in Callaghan's premiership. She was one who called the vote of no confidence to get Callaghan and Labour out. So she was the person who would instigate it all, so she was ready to follow through. Callaghan lost by a single vote. Was absolutely nail biting. There was just an enormous cheer went up right through the whole Conservative Party. It was not certain that they were going to lose. In a sense, it was quite tragic, but you just knew deep down something fresh was happening, something new was about to unfold. An historic election campaign began. Labour Party would like, I think they say, a long campaign because they think you'll be making the mistakes. I don't think that really has applied since the Prime Minister came back from Guadeloupe. After the darkest winter in living memory, Callaghan wanted to reassure the voters with a promise to improve industrial relations and return to full employment. The thrust of the Labour campaign was that we had come through the worst. That the conservative alternative would certainly bring higher unemployment. Labour government was making some last-minute attempts to stabilise the situation, setting up a commission on pay or something like that. Some, some attempt to persuade the public that everything was under control again. It plainly wasn't. And of course you've got a Labour government which was next to useless, who might as well have been wearing blue rosettes. The Conservatives focused on earning the votes of the traditional Labour voters alienated by the strikes, but this required a new style of campaigning that the party had not attempted before. She modernised the Tories. Up until then they had been completely establishment and her campaign was entirely different. Mrs Thatcher had a really good speech writer. She had a man called Gordon Reece who helped her with her image, with her looks, with her voice, even advising on her hair. She had another lady adviser who helped her with her clothes and the hospitality side of things. This was the first modern general election campaign. Thatcher's masterstroke was to hire Saatchi & Saatchi. Founded by brothers Charles and Maurice, they were fast growing a reputation as the best advertising agency in the land. These were some of the brightest young men and women in the entire country, and Thatcher and her team must have thought they'd died and gone to heaven to have those guys working for them. After a winter of strikes, Saatchi & Saatchi honed in on a fundamental issue for Labour voters, to create one of the most memorable election posters ever. Well, that was quite something. That was, I think, the first time I became aware of what a very clever advertising agency could do for a political party, because it was such a striking image and such a brilliant slogan. We didn't really need to spell out how we would fix things. We needed to spell out how badly things needed to be fixed. Thatcher didn't pull any punches as she demonstrated the practical impact of the winter of discontent on the British people. This is what £1 would buy for the housewife in groceries at the end of the Tory government in 1974. There you are, February 1974. This is what £1 will buy under Labour today. Thatcher was very, very clever because she immediately addressed what people's concerns there were. It was the cost of living crisis. Very astute. On the 2nd of May 1979, after five weeks of intense campaigning, The Sun reflected the national mood when its centre spread immortalised months of industrial chaos as the "winter of discontent". The next day the country went to the polls. But I went back into my parents' house and my dad came home from doing his vote. And he looked, he looked... It was a combination of sheepish and sick. And I said, "What have you done?" And he looked at me and he said, "What?" I said, "What have you just done?" I said, "Have you voted for her?" And he said, "Yes, I have." He said, "We all have, Carol." And he got really angry with me and he said, "She's a bloody leader." And that was in a village, a mining village, that, that would spit on Tories normally. Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Conservative, 20,918. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE They saw a strength in her. They saw a leader. And, and the strikes had just worn them down so much, they wanted someone to take charge. When Thatcher greeted her loyal party supporters at Tory HQ, she knew there was only one winner. Mrs Thatcher, could you tell me, several Labour politicians have already conceded victory. Are you claiming victory yet? Going nicely. Just going nicely. Can we call you Madam Prime Minister yet? We had a new government and a new Prime Minister. That's, erm... That's politics. There are workers, party workers at the windows here, waiting to see their leader leave. We are told she will be leaving any second now to get into her black Rover, three-litre, for the short drive to the palace to ask for a job, which she'll get. She'll be Prime Minister. Thatcher became Britain's new PM with a comfortable majority of 43 seats. The next morning, her speech on the doorstep of Number Ten was designed to demonstrate that with her in power, the winter of discontent was finally over. Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope. One of Thatcher's first moves was to enforce a series of anti-union measures. This included encouraging ballots before a strike. That was the beginning of the end for union power because it, literally, destroyed people's lives. It was a tragedy because I don't think it was a conscious determination by the trade union movement to bring down its own government, but a series of miscalculations and misjudgements. But she was a busy bunny from start to finish, so that when she took on the steelworkers in the early '80s and ultimately the mineworkers and NUM in the mid-80s, she knew exactly what she was doing, not least thanks to how badly Jim Callaghan had handled it all. During Thatcher's first term, her radical free market economics finally brought inflation under control. When Thatcher came in in '79 with a big working majority, the first things that she and her first Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, dealt with were inflation and a cost of living crisis and a public sector borrowing crisis. It hadn't gone away. It was going to be there, whoever was in power. It was a question of having someone in power who could deal with it. By confronting the unions and tackling the economy, the winter of discontent had given Thatcher the platform to become the longest-serving Prime Minister of the 20th century. So we'd had frequent changes of government, but then along came Margaret Thatcher and we had stability. We had the same government for, I think it was about 11 years. As we approach what looks to be the winter of discontent of 2022, when we look back, what can we learn? It's a sobering thought, isn't it, that we don't seem to have come on very much in these 40-odd years. Things were just the same then as they seem to be going now. We've got all these different strikes going on, wanting more pay. I think sometimes we've just got to grin and bear it. Once again, there are strikes on the horizon, but I can only say, having lived through it once, that it was not a solution, it was a battleground, and solutions happen when people talk together and work together and collaborate together. I'm afraid that the winter of discontent in the end cost communities, it cost an awful lot of happiness and we mustn't go back there. What we need is another talking dog. To me, the winter of discontent wasn't only about what happened all those years ago in the struggle between the trade unions and the Labour Party. It mapped out where we are now and how we got here. And lo and behold, here we are again back at high inflation, back at a government wrestling to find an economic policy that works, that the public can embrace. And to me, the final chapter is yet to be written. The good news is this - in the winter of discontent, we got through it. And I tell you this, we'll get through it again.
