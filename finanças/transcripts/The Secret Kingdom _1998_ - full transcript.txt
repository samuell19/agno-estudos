(intense music) (thunder booms) - [Child] Yeah, I'm okay. Mom, are you and Dad coming home soon? - [Mom] Yes, hon. - [Child] Okay. - [Mom] What did you have for dinner? - [Child] Dinner? Um, well ... I had, um ... Callie made, um ... She didn't make dinner. She hasn't made dinner since you left. I'm starving to death and you wouldn't believe it. I had cracker crumbs for breakfast and, you know what? She's been in your room trying on your clothes. I think she's wearing one of your bras right now. Please Mom, you gotta come home. I might not last the night. - [Mom] I'm sure you're exaggerating, Zack. - I am not exaggerating! She's the bad seed, I swear. (dramatic music) - [Mom] Be a good boy, brush your teeth and make your bed. Don't forget to take out the garbage. - Please, Mom. - Give me the phone. Get out of here. Hi, Mom. - [Mom] Are you picking on Zacky? - Oh no, he's just being a crybaby. - [Mom] You're sure? - You know how he exaggerates everything. - [Mom] He said you were starving him to death. - As if! - [Mom] Tell me the truth. - He's lying through his teeth. - [Mom] Tell me the truth, Callie. - No, I made a feast for dinner last night. - [Mom] Cleaning up everything? - Yeah, I'm keeping the place spic and span. In fact, I'm doing the dishes right now. - [Mom] That's nice, sweetheart. You're such a good girl. (playful music) - Yeah. - [Mom] So why did Zack call to talk to me? What's wrong? - I don't know. Yeah, he's just ... I don't know. - [Mom] What did he say? - Demented. - [Mom] Any trouble with Mark? - No, Mark's fine, Mom. I can do without his stupid drumming. It's stressing me out. (drumming) - Want to read it with me? - No way, spud. I like living. - Yeah. I love you too. See you on Thursday. Mm hmm. Bye bye. What are you up to you little pygmie snitch? Zachary Taylor Fremont, give me back my journal. That is it. Say goodbye to your little brother. - Cool. (dramatic music) - I'm gonna make you sorry you were ever born! Zachary Taylor Fremont, I want my journal back! (drumming) You are gonna get seriously hurt for this. This isn't funny at all. Give me back my journal! Where is he? Where did he go? - Ask me if I care. - Go drum yourself. - Marky, Marky save me! - No. You dug your grave. Now you die in it. - Yes, spud. Now die! - You got your stupid diary back so leave me alone. - You're right. I have a better idea anyway. You took my journal, I'm gonna take your toys. - No! Please, Callie. No, no! - [Callie] Goodbye Chuckles the Clown, goodbye Ultraman, goodbye intercom set, goodbye Fluffy, Muffy, and Mr. Toad. - [Zachary] No, no, no, not Mr. Toad! No! (dramatic music) - I hate you, Callie. (drumming) - What are you looking at? - You, Sister Cruella. - What do you care? - I don't. I just don't see how you get off terrorizing that little cockroach that's half your age. - He deserved it, okay. And twice as much. He took my journal. In some countries they would cut his hand off for that. - So what's the big deal about your stupid diary anyways? - It's not a diary. It's a journal. (chuckles) What do you care? - I don't, I just can't figure out why you spend so much time scribbling in it. (suspenseful music) (thunder booms) (static feedback) - Yeah! My toys! Chuckles the Clown, Ultraman, my intercom set, Fluffy, Muffy, and Mr. Toad! (static voices) - [Man] Calling the (static hisses). Please reply. Any being-- Can you detect this transmission? Please reply. - Hello? - [Man] Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is speaking? - Zack Fremont. - [Man] I knew it. I knew there was someone out there. This is Chartwell from the Kingdom of Relcon. Are you from the world outside? Please, I have to know. Are you speaking from the world outside? - What? - [Chartwell] Please, I have to know. Are you speaking from the world outside? - Um, no. I'm inside in my kitchen. - [Chartwell] Kitchen? Please repeat. Did you say that you were speaking from a kitchen? - Yeah, yeah. I'm in my kitchen. I'm just picking you up on my intercom. Are you a power dork or what? Where are you anyway? - I'm speaking to you from my laboratory in the Kingdom of Relcon. I am Engineer Chartwell. I'm speaking to you on my radio transformer. Zack, are you still there? - Yeah, I'm here but I told you I'm not outside and I never heard of any Kingdom of Relcon. - How can you not know of Relcon? What else is there besides the Kingdom of Relcon and the world beyond, the world outside. - I don't know what you're talking about. - [Chartwell] Are you not from the world of the rain and of the sun? If you are from the outside, you know the meaning of these words, the rain and the sun. - Sure I do. You don't have rain or sun in the Kingdom of Relcon? - They are words from the old times, the old books. We have forgotten their meaning. - Why don't you just look out-- (intercom clatters) Oops. (thunder booms) - Zack, the earth thunders. - No, no. I just dropped the-- - [Chartwell] Zack, are you still there? Please, Zack Fremont can you hear me? - Wow! Whoa! - Look, spud. You want to get yourself killed by Callie, that's none of my business. You want to poison yourself with household products? That's also none of my business. But either way, do it quietly huh? I'm trying to sleep. You're keeping me up. (static feedback) - [Chartwell] Please, Zack Fremont we've been discovered by the regent and his soldiers. They are at my door. We need your help. - Whoa, what was that? - That's Mr. Chartwell from the Kingdom of Relcon. - [Chartwell] Please respond, Zack Fremont. I may not have much time. The regent's troops are breaking in. - Okay, what's the trick? - No trick. There's a tiny kingdom under the sink. - [Chartwell] Zack from the world beyond. We have been discovered. I beg you. We need your help. - What can I do Mr. Chartwell? - Forget it, that's it. Game over. - Brace yourself. I'm gonna activate the energy transformer. (troops shouting) (electricity crackles) (whooshing) (screams) (intense music) - [Commander] Seal off the lab. Search the whole area. Find fugitive Chartwell. I want him dead or alive. (troops chattering) (electricity crackling) Did you look there? (electricity crackling) (whooshing) (suspenseful music) (troops chattering) Seal this place up. Maybe we'll find him outside. (whimpering) (man mumbling) (shouting) (scary music) - Excuse me, ma'am? Could you tell me where I am? Excuse me? Lady? (scary music) (whistles blare) (Mark screams) (scary music) (whistles blare) Help, let me in! Help! Hey, come on! (whistle blares) (Mark screams) - Don't fight. Don't run. Come. - What did I do? - Questioning. - [Mark] Wait a second. Where are you taking me? Put me down! I am not an animal! I am a human being! (dramatic music) - Marky? Marky, you there? Marky? (hysterical laughter) (Zachary screams) (scary music) - Zack? Zack, you little cockroach. Come on, man. Are you out there? Zack? Come on, spud. - Come. Questioning. - He's just a boy, Chartwell. - [Chartwell] So much for the accuracy of our prison informants. Nevertheless, it does prove that my energy transformer worked after all. - He's not what I pictured coming through from the outside. I always imagined them as being more, well, godlike. - Why shouldn't they have children as we do? Come on. I have an idea. - [Soldier] Sit. (triumphant music) - Sir, report from Identification Department. - Excellent. Impossible, completely impossible. No record of his blood type? No classified fingerprints? No registration mark? A boy with no name? Impossible. The little brat. Ah, here he is, our mysterious visitor. - [Mark] What do you want from me? - How did Chartwell manage to remove your registration mark? - Man, I don't have a clue what you're talking about. - Well my boy, if you're a fraud you're a masterpiece. I'll give you that. No registration mark on your arm, no records, no history. Where did you come from? How did you get here? - By way of the kitchen sink. I'm from another place, another place outside of the Kingdom of Relcon. - Silence. It is forbidden to speak of the space outside. It's blasphemy. Now do you understand the problem that you pose? - I just want to go home. - Remove the chains. For an unregistered child to be born in the Kingdom of Relcon is impossible, but for a child to come in from the space outside the kingdom? That is more than impossible. It denies the fundamental article of our faith. This is the symbol of the Kingdom of Relcon. Perfection. There is only Relcon. There is nothing beyond the forbidden edge. There is no outside. There is only Relcon which is the life force. Beyond the edge is only death. Now, if you come from a place outside the kingdom, that means our religion is a lie and that my power as regent is invalid. - I get it. - Where did your outside come from? How did it get there? - I don't know. What about Relcon? Where did it come from? How did it get here? - You are trying my patience, boy. - Okay, look. I don't know this Chartwell. I don't know anything about any rebels or any opposition or anything else. I'm not from here. I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana in the United States of America. My little brother found this tiny kingdom in our cabinet. There was all this funky noise coming from his toy intercom. Before I knew it, time warp. Here I am, wherever here is. And I just want to go home. - And home you shall go. If you wish to return to your home, you must first sign this declaration. You will be admitting that you were raised in secret by Chartwell and his band of rebels. Sign the document. Agree to obey all the laws and regulations of Relcon and to accept the registration mark and I'll send you home. - What happens if I don't sign? - Let's just say that it would be better if you didn't entertain that option. - So I sign and you'll send me home? - Yes. Sign the paper, I send you home. (dramatic music) - There. Signed. Now send me home. - Excellent. Of course, there is still a slight problem. - You said I could go home! - And you will. As a parent-less child in the Kingdom of Relcon, your home is the state orphanage. - You lied to me. - Tricked, maybe. Lied? No. (snaps) - [Mark] Let me go! - As a citizen of Relcon, you are now bound by our laws. Most notably, the law against the public utterance of blasphemy, a law which you have repeatedly violated. Your punishment, of course, is perfection. - What's that? - Perfection is perfection. We all come into this world so appallingly generalized, so ill-suited to our chosen roles in life. We have developed the means of correcting that, of perfecting ourselves. I, myself, had the surgery. To become a stronger leader, I had part of my brain removed. - Which part? - That soft part where sits compassion. I'm sure the Ministry of Perfection can decide just the right kind of surgery to make you useful. - [Mark] Useful? This is a nightmare. - Soon we will begin to implement my rule of universal perfection. So many people are in need of perfecting. Everyone, really. Of course, there will always be reactionary elements opposed to any sort of improvement, but our business is at an end. - Wait a second, don't do this to me. I just want to go home. I'll do anything you want. - Child, you are doing what I want. (dramatic music) (Mark screams) - Callie? - I'm busy. - You seen Mark? - Nope. - He isn't in his room. - Guess he's somewhere else. - I guess. - I said I was busy. - Oh, okay. Well, I'll go find him. (dramatic music) (screaming) - Perfection. Splendid. Perfection. (humming) What's your idea, Dr. Bernham? What do you think? Trash collector? Kitchen helper? Yes, a kitchen helper I think. Muscle up those arms, clip out a vertebrae to get him down to oven size. Enlarge the nose. Double up the olfactory ball for a nice, acute sense of smell then (chuckles) snip, snip out those unhappy parts of the brain and make him nice and cheerful. Yes, a nice and cheerful little kitchen helper. Do a nice job on this one, Dr. Bernham. People will be watching him. We want him to make us proud. - Yes, Chief Surgeon. I won't have any trouble, I'm sure. - Trouble? Wait a second, I don't want to be a kitchen helper. Just send me home. - Don't worry, young man. When Dr. Bernham is done with you you'll never want to be anything else. You'll fit your job perfectly. He's all yours, Dr. Bernham. - I'll do my best. Don't worry, young man. I've done this many times before. We've come to rescue you. You must be the boy everyone is talking about, the boy from the outside. It really works. - Come on, Chartwell. We've got to go. - You're Chartwell? And you work here, making these monsters? - No, no, no, no. I'm an engineer, not a butcher. (whistle blares) (alarm blares) Quickly! (shouting) (dramatic music) (knocking) - Dr. Bernham? It's me, the Chief Surgeon. - [Mark] What's that? - [Chartwell] (mumbles). - Highly explosive. - [Chartwell] Let's get out of here. (hissing) (pounding) - Dr. Bernham! Break it down. (thudding) Show some effort. (hissing) (explosion booms) - That won't fool the regent for long. He'll have his trackers on us in no time. - Where are we going? - We're gonna go to a rebel camp by the lake. Come on. (dogs barking and snarling) - [Regent] That's it. That's it. Find the trail. - [Chartwell] Hurry, hurry, quickly. Rub this on your hands and feet quickly. - [Mark] What is it? - Oil of stinkweed. It paralyzes the trackers' sense of smell or at least it confuses it. Okay, let's go. (dramatic music) Come on, we can lose them if we make it to the lake. (dogs barking and snarling) - Where are they, boy? Find them. Now! (dramatic music) - Our camp's right on the other side. - Welcome, I've been expecting you. - [Chartwell] Run, Mark! (gun shots boom) (dogs barking) (gun shots boom) (horns blaring) (dogs barking) (shouting) (gun shots boom) - We've been waiting for you. (pleasant music) - Well, Mark Fremont. Little more excitement than you'd planned, eh? - I wish you would have asked me before you sucked me into this nightmare. - Yes, yes, I suppose you're right but, you see, it was an emergency situation. - That's fine, but it wasn't my emergency. - No, I suppose not. Mark, to tell you the truth we need your help. Come with me, would you? I'd like to show you something. This is it right here. Do you know this sign? - Yeah, it's the Kingdom of Relcon. I've seen it. - It was not always our symbol. We believe that this symbol, a long time ago, once stood for the Kingdom of Relcon. Does it mean anything to you? - Yeah, it looks like a sun. - (chuckles) Yes, we have read that word many times in these old books forbidden to us for so many years now, but what is it? We know that it provides warmth, that it rises and falls, and that there are other ancient words, rain, snow, stars. Those are words that mean something to you, eh? - Yeah, sure. - Yet they have no meaning here in Relcon. Rather, we have forgotten their meaning. Something happened to our kingdom that we were broken away from our world and ended up here, wherever here may be, and that this symbol came with the change. I believe that this symbol will show us the way back to where we belong if the people find out that you are from the outside, from the world where the sun shines. It will join us. It will be dangerous. You will be risking your life, but the reward will be the liberation of all Relcon. Will you help us? - (sighs) No way. - Oh yeah, I'm sure he's okay it's just I didn't want him to miss dinner. - [Woman] I'm sure he's fine. - Yeah. - [Woman] I'll call you later. - Thanks. - [Woman] Bye. - Bye. Where did that little puke go? (Zachary groans) You. - What? - Where is he? - Who? - The older sibling, remember? You asked about him this morning and you've been looking guilty all day. Now what happened? Did he fall down a well or something? - I don't know. - Look, if Mom and Dad get home and Mark's AWOL, I'm gonna be in a world of hurt but whatever they do to me I swear I'm gonna do to you double, now talk. - It wasn't my fault. I found a little kingdom under the sink and then Mark came down and then he turned into a little ball of light and he flew into the sink. - What? (thunder booms) - Still no sign of our fugitive child or his rebel rescuers. What is your report on this machine of rebel Chartwell's? - Well, your grace, it's still uncertain. It is impossible for a voice to come through, nevermind a little boy. We are certain of that. That's certainly, certainly yes. - Is that your report? - Approximately. (snaps) - This is a frequency resonator? - Yes, my grace. - And these signal amplifiers? - Yes, my grace. - Activate it. - Yes, my grace. (hissing) (dramatic music) You speak into. - This is Chartwell speaking. If anyone can hear me, please reply. (electricity crackles) (thunder booms) - See, I told you so. Here, try this. - [Regent] Speaking to the world outside. - What's going on here? - That's exactly what Marky said. - Can anyone hear me? Please, answer. - Who is this? - This is Chartwell from the Kingdom of Relcon. Who is this? - I'm somebody who's gonna get you arrested is who I am. - [Regent] Where are you located? - On a floor in front of the kitchen sink. Now where's my brother? - Actually, we are currently trying to locate your brother. Perhaps you can be of some assistance. - Some assistance, huh? You want to know how I'm going to assist you? You ever hear of the NOPD? New Orleans Police Department? The cops? You ever hear of illegal messing around with a minor? - Who is this insolent child? I'd like to meet her. Connect the main transformer circuit. - Yes, my grace. (electricity crackling) - What have you done, Zachary Taylor Fremont? - I told you it wasn't my fault. (electricity crackling) (whooshing) (dramatic music) (electricity crackling) (whooshing) Zachary Taylor Fremont! What is going on here? Who are you guys? - Welcome to the Kingdom of Relcon, sweet child. (Callie groans) Take her to the palace. - [Catherine] Look. - That's my sister. What do you think he'll do to her? - Don't worry, son. We'll find a way to help her before he has time to do her any harm. - Thank you. Let me get this straight. My idiot brother's fallen into a group of-- - Rebels. Please, help yourself to some more sweet confections. - Thank you. - And you need me to save his sorry butt and help you stop the rebels from taking over the kingdom. - Exactly. - And I'm supposed to pretend that I'm really from the Kingdom of Relcon and Mark is too? - Yes. - Why? - It's the only way to save him. Rest assured, if the rebels win they'll have no more use for your brother or you. - And when this is all over with, you'll send us home? - Of course. Once we have you and your brother safe, you'll both be going home. - So what's all this stuff about being perfected? - That's just a little technique we've developed. A way of improving ourselves. Everyone can stand with a bit of improvement, don't you think? - Yeah, I suppose. - We can do all sorts of perfections. We can make you taller. We can make you thinner, happier. Would you like a happy, permanent smile? Always happy? - No, that's creepy. I wouldn't mind being a little prettier, like my mother. She's beautiful. - Beautiful like mother. That's a sweet thought, my dear. - I don't want to be too pretty, like a model or anything. - No, no. Not too pretty. - No, not too. I think I'd like to be thought of as lovely. Isn't that girl lovely? Callie, she's just so lovely. Yes, yes, that's the word. - Yes indeed, lovely it is. I promise you, my dear, when we're through with you you will have no complaints about anything. You will be perfect. - So what's the catch? - [Regent] No catch. Just sign on the dotted line. - She signed a confession claiming I raised her and Mark here and that I instructed them both in subversive activities against the kingdom. - Why would she do that? - She's my stupid sister, that's why. - The regent also presented a document confirming everything the girl said and signed by you, Mr. Fremont. - Well, what was I supposed to do? He said he would send me home if I signed. - So is this a pattern in your family? - Look lady, I didn't ask to come here any more than Callie did. The regent said he would send me home. He didn't. You said you'd send me home. You haven't. Is there a pattern in your kingdom? - The real damage is that the regent used the confessions to persuade the Board of Governors to finally approve his Rule of Universal Perfection. The worse news is that Callie's perfection surgery is scheduled for some time tomorrow. - They'll probably turn her into a fire hydrant. - The question is, what can we do about it? - Nothing. They'll be expecting some kind of action. A whole army will be protecting the Ministry of Perfection when they take her in. - I can't believe this. You guys are just gonna sit here on your butts while they slice my sister up? What kind of rebels are you? (dramatic music) (clattering) - [Catherine] Chartwell, if we try to rescue her we're bound to suffer heavy casualties. - If we do nothing, we sacrifice an innocent girl and we become the very monsters we claim to be fighting. - Maybe the poor girl will be better off with the regent's transformation? - How can you say that! - Look, for those who don't believe she's from outside it won't make any difference. For those who do, she'll be a martyr. A victim of perfection. Chartwell, this is the best use we can make of her? - Since when have we started using people? - She won't be helped by our committing suicide. - Then let's not. Catherine, our moment is at hand. The engineers who witnessed her arrival know that girl cannot be from Relcon. The word is spreading too fast for the regent to stop it. We are going to rescue that poor child, we are going to send her and the boy back to the outside, to their home, and in the process we are going to defeat the regent. - I think you're making a big mistake, Chartwell, but I stood with you in the beginning. If this is to be the end, then so be it. I'll fight with you too. - Yeah, me too. I'll fight with you too. (moaning) - Thank you, Stitch. - This is cool. I'm way, way relaxed. (chuckles) Talk about your microsurgery. I mean, we're already microscopic to begin with (laughs). - I'm gonna begin surgery now. - Whatever. Oh, one more tiny question. - No, no, no more. Get on with it. - Yes, your grace. - Your grace. - Chief Constable? - Communication from opposition. - Really? How interesting. They are offering to place themselves entirely in my hands under a flag of truce. They must know I'll never let them go. Of course they do. Fascinating, yes? Stop the surgery. - But, your grace-- - The girl will have to remain imperfect a little while longer. - (chuckles) This rocks (giggles). (dramatic music) - Their reply. - Excellent. - He's agreed to the truce? - [Chartwell] Of course, he did. - Chartwell, you know the regent will never permit you to send those kids back to the outside. You are putting this boy and us directly into his hands. - That's exactly the point. The meeting is this afternoon. He is setting his trap. We must set ours. - Your grace, the building is secured. - Good. - Your grace, this is a deadly game. - What other game is worth playing? - Let me at least double the guard inside. - No, I want to make it easy for them. (chuckles) What tangled webs we weave. (playful music) - Someone comes. - Your grace? - Well, this is an unexpected maneuver. Any sign of the others? - No, the boy's alone. - Then let's go see what he wants. (Callie yawns) - I don't feel any prettier. - Strange child. Sits on ground like Indian chief. Get men ready. Wait signal. (dramatic music) - Men, this is General Zachary Taylor Fremont. Noah's Company 46, fall in. Looks like the enemy is about to attack the Kingdom of Relcon so saddle up and move out. Hoo-ha. - So have you come all by yourself, brave child? - [Mark] Yeah. - They're out. Let's go. - [Mark] I have a message from Chartwell. - Do you? - He wants to know if you intend to honor the terms of the truce. - (chuckles) Refresh my memory. What specifically am I expected to do? - Callie and I return home to the outside. In return, Chartwell agrees to destroy his energy transformer and all his instructions to build it. After that, the truce is over and you're free to do whatever you want. - I see. Of course, I already have the machine and I already have your sister and, in point of fact, I now have you, don't I? - Do you? - This is Chartwell speaking from the Kingdom of Relcon (giggles). - [Man] Gobble, gobble, gobble. Gobble, gobble, gobble. (thudding) Gobble, gobble, gobble. Gobble, gobble, gobble. (thudding) - Hey, you guys? You having a party or what? I think I'd better go get that regent guy. - [Chartwell] Inside, check it out. Let's go. - Oh my god, you're the rebels! - Yes, my dear. We are the rebels. - I'm a hostage! - You were a hostage. We've just rescued you. - Huh? - Chartwell certainly knows I would never honor such a truce. Why arrange it then? Why send you here as he's done? What is he planning to do? I turned this problem over and over this way and that way. Suddenly it became clear. The one thing Chartwell wants more than freedom itself is that marvelous energy machine of his. - See signal. (whistle blares) - Here they come. Watch out for the boy. (whistle blares) (exciting music) - [Zachary] Light 'em up, men. Fire full effects. Incoming rounds. Hoo-ha, boys. Hoo-ha. (explosions boom) (shouting) (gun shots boom) (exciting music) - I want Chartwell alive! - [Soldier] No, your grace. Let him go. (gun shots boom) (exciting music) (shouting) (explosions boom) - Come on, kid. Let's go. (gun fire booms) - Your noble Chartwell has walked right into my web. What a fool. Can you see that? He could have killed me out there but he missed his chance and that will be his last mistake for now I have him surrounded. (gun fire booms) - Are you two okay? - Yes. - Okay, just keep your head down. - Cockroach! - What did I do? - You joined the rebels. - Get a clue. The rebels are the good guys. - (scoffs) Says who? - There's no time to explain. Let's leave it at this. This is the machine that brought you here. If you ever want to get home, we're gonna be the ones to send you. - Oh, well okay then. You are in for some serious hurt when we get home. - Like I'm scared of you. - They've stopped firing, your grace. - Perhaps they've run out of ammunition. How unfortunate for them. - Stop firing. Stop firing. - It's gotten awfully quiet out there. I think the bad guys are planning a sneak attack. Be ready for anything men. (soldiers shouting) - Anything? - Not a peep, but I don't think they've forgotten us. Is he okay? - Yeah, I've got it all under control. - Good. - Can I help? - No, thank you. Don't worry, son. We should be able to hold out long enough to get this thing working. Then at least we'll be able to send you and your sister home. - But why just us? You can escape the same way. - No, no, no. I'm afraid not. I tried for six years to project Relcon sized objects into the outside. It never did work, but you don't have to worry. You're both from the outside. It should work for you. I hope. - Then what'll happen to you? - That is not for you to worry about. Please, let me finish here. (soldiers shouting) (whirring) I think I may have it. Yes, it's up. It's working. - All right, it's about time. - We have to get you into the focus here. - No, wait a second. (whirring) What's that sound? - It sounds like they're bringing the tanks in. - It's nothing. We hear it all the time. Sounds from the outside. Doesn't mean a thing. Come, come, come. - No, wait. I know that sound. (whirring) - [Zachary] At ease, men. Chow's on its way. - It's Zack. Is the radio transformer working? - Yes, of course. - What can he do? - He can save us. How do I use it? - Just talk through here. - Gotta feed the troops. - [Mark] Zack? Dude, can you hear me? - Mark? Marky? - Zack, are you out there? Zack? Look man, we need your help. I promise, you won't get sucked in. Zack come on, man. Zack! - Zack, get over to the cabinet now if you know what's good for you. - You can't hurt me, Callie. You're not even here. You're there, wherever there is. - Zack, listen man I'm really sorry I didn't help you before. I promise if you help us I'll kill Callie if she hurts you again. And I'll even tell Mom and Dad what she did to you. - Want me to send my troops in to rescue you? - What are you talking about? - Get ready, troops. We're about ready to go into action. - Hey, forget about that right now. Listen, this is really important. This is what I want you to do. - What are they waiting for? - They should be able to hear you three blocks away. One of my early inventions I called my sound amplifier. It's working. Just speak. - Hello, hello? My name's Mark Fremont. I'm from the world outside. Everyone, listen to me. I have the power to destroy the Kingdom of Relcon. I can do it in a second. - Can't we stop that noise? - It's coming from inside Chartwell's lab, sir. - You don't believe me? I'll give you a little demonstration. - This is absurd. Order your men in. - But, your grace, my men ... - Zack, now. - Roger that. Fire in the hole. (dramatic music) - Your grace, a shadow splits the air. (water splashing) (vibration booms) - Next time it could come down on your palace or the building you're in right now or anywhere in Relcon. I have the power to destroy the whole kingdom or any part of it. It's just that easy. Surrender immediately. Or the wrath of Mark will be upon you. - Your grace, we can't fight a force like that. We must surrender. - We will not. - But, your grace, the boy has powers. We must surrender. - Captain? - Your grace? - Order the surrender. - Yes, your grace. Attention, this is your captain. Throw down your weapons and surrender. (cheering) - Try one of these chewy ones. They're pretty kind. - I just wish they had some of those delicious peaches. - Mark, Callie, everything okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, the food's great. So what's the story? Are you in charge here now? - Temporarily. - So, are you a king or what? - To be quite honest, I'm leaning in a different direction. I rather like the Republic of Relcon. I think it has a nice ring to it. - What about the regent? - We have a fitting punishment in store for him. - Cool. - And as for you two, what say we send you home? - [Callie] Ready. (whirring) (electricity crackles) - There, just about ready. Perhaps now that our two worlds have made contact we can continue our communication. Who knows. Establish trade, an exchange of art, technology ... - Yeah, I mean you guys could make micro-circuits with, like, picks or shovels or something. - What about Relcon? I mean, about getting back to wherever you guys came from. - Who knows? Time and space align. Perhaps it took only the twist of a wire in some other reality or the closing of a circuit in just the right time and place and in just the right way to pluck Relcon out of its world and transport us here. We may know the answer some day. (triumphant music) Goodbye Mark, Callie. Have a safe trip back. - Goodbye. - Yeah, see you around. (electricity crackling) (whooshing) (whooshing) - (sighs) Home sweet home. I love home. I love you too, Zack. - Really? - Yeah. And I'm gonna cook you breakfast. - You mean it? - Yeah, right after I clean up your troops. Talk about obsessive. - What's with the dorky outfit? - It's a long story, spud. Let's check in at the sink and I'll tell you all about it. What's this? - What's what? - Hand me the flashlight. - Let me see, spud. Whatcha doing? Urban renewal? - Chill, I see something. - What is it? - I don't know, something attached to the cold water pipe. Lightning bolt grounder. Some kind of old fashioned gadget. - Like a lightning rod. - Yeah, to protect the house. - Doesn't look like it did a very good job. - I bet that's what happened. Lightning struck and it melted the wire, just like Chartwell said. This old gadget, at just the right time, in just the right place. Lightning strikes and somehow it breaks through to some other time and some other place and brings Relcon through. - Wonder what would happen if we reattach the wire. (electricity crackling) - Whoa! Over here! (explosion booms) That lightning must have been trapped in there a long time. When you reconnected the wire, it finally grounded out. - What about Relcon? - Yeah. - [Mark] It's gone. - Wrecked? - No, they've gone back home too. - [Both] Cool. (dramatic music) (horse neighs) (pleasant music) - [Man] Look! - [Child] What is it, Daddy? (pleasant music) - [Regent] Hello? Get me out of here! (sighs) I hate peaches. (pleasant music) (MultiCom Jingle)
