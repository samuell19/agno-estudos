That's where she lives. Get her. You've got the wrong person. Tie her up, before she bewitches us all. Quickly. -That's not nice. -Yeah, they were rough. Dad, it's a depressing story with a sad witch and all that. So never mind. I think I'm going to sleep. Just keep listening. The inhabitants of that island had been dissatisfied for a long time. -An island? -Yes. A very strange island not that far from here. Is it a true story? It all started in the Middle Ages. Know what they are? Dad, really? THE WOLGENGOUW AROUND 1415 The witch endured it all with a strange smile on her face. -Aren't you exaggerating a bit? -Silence. This island was afflicted by a plague. Who doesn't remember the bad crops year after year? -And Farmer Guus' vanished pigs? -They vanished just like that. I don't understand it. And the sour milk of Gertie's cows? I left the milk outside for four weeks and it was already sour. Witchcraft. But… but… these catastrophes will end now. Behold the cause of all this evil. This Satanist… -Amarantha. -Nice to meet you. If she floats… -she's a witch. -Yes, a witch. Not a witch after all. Sorry! The villagers were about to leave… when Amarantha shot up out of the water… You've made a big mistake. I really am a witch, but I mean no harm. There will be punishment for those who don't think and drown kind women without evidence. I curse this island and anyone who comes ashore here. When I blow on this shell, you'll be… very annoying for eternity. Very annoying? Ooh, that's bad. It's worse than you think. So everyone became annoying? Thanks, Dad, this is worthwhile. Believe me when I tell you this story is about you. -Really? -In some way it is. The island became completely different from the rest of the country. For hundreds of years, the people on the island were annoying. And they never left the island. -Boring. -They didn't mind, I think. Except for one boy. Hunter. Hunter! -Right, Hunter. Are we paying attention? -Sorry, sir. Toodle-oo. Answer? What was the question again? In which year did the witch persecution end? Around 1750, sir. Well, you happen to have that right. Right. So 1750. But by that time for many women… Oh, my God. Ladies. In those days, superstition was an important part of daily life. It explained all sorts of worldly affairs we understand better today. I'll write some of those years on the blackboard so you can write them down. OK, kick it. You should know that he was scared to death of water. So the only islander who wanted to leave was scared of water? -Quite the coincidence. -There are more of those in this story. So get used to it. Hey, deaf kid! -Hey, deaf kid! -You just said that. I'm just saying it twice. Who cares? -Where are you going? -To the opening. Boring. I'm surprised you dare to cycle here. Know what's scary? That you lose control of your handle bars. And then… Bye, Hunter! -Stupid girls. -Annoying, right? He had to hurry, because something special was about to happen. The island was finally connected to the mainland. OK, here we go. One, two… The prime minister, the most important man of the country, was the first normal person to set his foot on the island. Oh, dear. -Congratulations. -Shall we toast? TODAY TERRIBLE BRIDGE OPENING I had to taste it. Cheers. As you can see, the Prime Minister, who loves nature, just opened… this historic bridge. Oh, my God, is the Prime Minister here? Stop it, guys. This was Jack Schipper from the Wolgengouw. Back to the studio. Back to you, Bianca. Gross, it's in my mouth. Mom, I was at the bridge opening. I even saw the Prime… Absolute silence. -But, Mom, I thought that tomorrow… -Help me with the plates. After you take off your dirty shoes. And go. Dad, dinner. Who of my sweet little girls is hungry today? Let's have a look. Ah, I see. It's little Djoeke. Come on. Gosh, Rob, who's having dinner with us tonight? Lieneke? No, Djoeke of course. She's starving. Just like all of us, right? Well, let's go and eat. Hungry, hungry. Come and sit with Daddy. And behave yourself. Enjoy your dinner everyone And go. The fumes are affecting my throat. What if I can't rap anymore? You've never been able to. Mom, the bridge is open. Maybe we can go to the other side tomorrow. Now that the bridge is open, we can go to the other side. Hunter, please. Stop whining about that bridge. -Learn to be satisfied with what you have. -Exactly. Right, Djoeke? You understand that his enthusiasm was dampened. He didn't say anything else all evening. Such losers. Not everyone has such a great dad as you do. Something was about to happen that would influence everyone on the island. -That burp? -Just listen. OFFICIAL RESIDENCE PRIME MINISTER -How long has it been? -It started this morning. Could you please put that down? That vase is worth millions. Fine. Now I'm going to phone the leader of North Korea with a funny voice. Worrisome. -Has he been examined? -They couldn't find anything. -What? -He's healthy as a horse. His heart is fine. Eyes, ears, everything's fine. -I hear a 'but' coming on. -Well, he's just very… -What? -Annoying. Annoying? There. Now we're getting back… to work. P.J., please take me to the House of Representatives. Over the A4, because the A3 is completely backed up. Completely backed up. HEAD OFFICE SECURITY SERVICE -Any idea? -Poison? No, they'd have noticed during his checkup. Something else is going on. Let's backtrack for a minute. Where has he been to recently? Let's see. The official residence, the country house, a reception in Brussels, opening of the bridge to the Wolgengouw, bingo evening with some veterans, a conversation with the king, What did you say? -A bingo evening with some veterans. -No, before that. -Reception in Brussels? -No, after that. -Conversation with the king. -Right. In between that. Opening of the bridge to the Wolgengouw. -The Wolgengouw? -It's some island. I want to know everything about that. Sweetheart, I noticed that you were unpleasant during dinner. I disapprove of that. After deliberating with myself, I've decided to ground you for a week. You can only go to school and back. To school and back. Nothing more, nothing less. Bye, Hunter. BURUNDI AFRICA We've been observing these apes for four weeks now. And yesterday was the first time they seemed happy to see us. -Can you mount the telephoto lens, Aafje? -Already done, Dad. How should this go? Your arm's in the wrong way. Take it off. Oh, like this. Hold your stomach in, Dad. A little bit… -There. -Thank you. I hope Bangida will come just as close as yesterday. She really loves you. It's good to see, honey. -Dad? -Yes, sweetheart? Dr. Boudewijn Driessen-van der Pol and Dr. Frank van der Pol-Driessen? -Yes. -Security Service. -Follow us, gentlemen. -Huh? -Why? -Classified. It's a case of national interest. That's all I can say for now. -Now, gentlemen. -Hold on. We can't leave now. -There's interesting developments… -We don't have time for that. Wait a minute. -Well, this is a first. -Dad! They knew it was serious. You don't get dragged out of Burundi for nothing. It's a very long trip. Dad... Gentlemen, again, good that you're here. -I don't think we had a choice. -That's true. Follow me. -No. -Wait, Aaf. We'll see you in a minute. "About Primates and Why They Do Certain Things." -Interesting read, gentlemen. -Right. But what are we doing here? During a visit to an island, that until recently was cut off from the world, the Prime Minister of this country was exposed to something… unknown. The first symptoms started after a week. Since then, his behavior is, to put it mildly, worrisome. His behavior? How does he act? Annoying, gentlemen. -Annoying? -His behavior is very annoying. I have an anthology of the Wolgengouw. A lot of annoying behavior and it looks like the Prime Minister has been infected by those islanders. What are we supposed to do with this information? It's your job to investigate the island and to come up with a solution. Before it's too late. Before it's too late? Sorry, but aren't you exaggerating a bit? Oh, my. Oopsy. Oopsy. Oopsy. Can I rely on you? We're just scientists, ma'am. It's kind of you… That project of yours. It's subsidized, isn't it? -Yes. -Well, it would be sad if that subsidy were canceled and you had to cease that research into your hairy friends. So, good luck, gentlemen. The clock's ticking. I'd say… -On your way. -Oh, right. Sorry. Of course. Everything OK? Yes. Of course, sweetheart. Come on. They had to leave that same day. Suddenly they had to go to a place where they knew no one. Sounds familiar. Keep an eye on them. If they can't manage, we'll have to take different steps. Yes, ma'am. Go. -You're very late. -Sorry, we… Coming late is a sign of a bad character. Hello? What do you mean, 'late'? An hour and a half. So what? I'll be there in a few hours, or longer. OK, much happiness in your new home. Bye. -That woman is unbelievable. -Yes, bizarre. Let's raise a glass to our first data collection. Guys, pay attention. -This is Brechtje. -Aafje. Brechtje is new here, so we all say, "Hello, Brechtje." -Hello, Brechtje. -Hello, Aafje. -What a warm welcome, Brechtje. -My name is Aafje. Hello, little girl. How are you? Must be scary. A new class, a new school and all new kids. Oh, I can imagine that a sweet little girl like you is terrified. Go find a safe spot in the classroom. Bye, sweet little girl. Coochy coochy coo. OK… Go and work on something of your own, because this guy is not going to do anything today. -Hi. -Hi. Well, look at that. They make a nice couple. Aw, she's blushing. Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss… Now what? He now knew that this girl was different from all the other people he'd ever met. -Have you never been off the island? -No, I haven't. Freaky. -Is it very different over there? -On the mainland, you mean? -Yes. -Well, everyone here acts kind of weird. -Bye. -Bye. Flint, can you move aside? No way. -I'm OK. -Not. I'm borrowing your brush, whether you want me to or not. When you get it back, my filthy hairs will probably be stuck in it. -OK. -Who was that girl you were with? -Aafje, a girl from my class. -Don't let those chicas drive you crazy. She's very… different. You think they're different But they aren't They're all snakes They play with your feelings and drop you Don't play with my feelings, chica Play with someone else It doesn't rhyme. It's about the flow. -Shit. -They've only been deflated. -It happens every day around here. -Well, that's stupid. -You get used to it. Here. -Thanks. What a nightmare. Heard anything from Frank and Boudewijn yet? No, ma'am. I hope they come up with a solution soon. -No, no watching soccer, honey. -But look. Soccer match. The referee gives everyone a red card and no one thinks it's odd. It's worse than we thought. Every layer of the population is affected. Right. Hey ref, don't be stupid! Handball. -I'm not playing, you know. -What? Protest? Here. Both of you a red card. Go take a shower. Come on, this nonsense has lasted long enough. -Oh, no. I know that look. -I've got an idea. I was afraid of that. -So what are your dads investigating? -You guys. -They're looking for a solution. -A solution? For what? Where we live, people are different. Everyone here is so… -How shall I put it? Annoying. -Sorry? Annoying? Yeah, look. -Sweetie, I'm here. -Shush, Mom, you're embarrassing. Daan's friends, you're very important to Daan. Did you know that? -Give them a kiss, Daan. -No, Mom, please. Give them a kiss. They are so sweet. -See? -See what? How you deal with each other is so weird. -Aren't you exaggerating a bit? -You don't notice. You're used to it. -You act as if we're all crazy. -You are. -You're crazy yourself. -Hunter… -Hunter! -Yeah, bye. Remember that remedy we used to calm those apes down? Yes, I remember. It was too strong. Those apes just slept for a week. And some of them died. -Got it. -Come on, Bou. We can't do that. The sooner we get things under control here, the sooner we can go home. He suddenly saw it. He was different. And the island where he'd been living all of his life didn't feel like home. Little Svetlana, what's wrong? I don't hear anything. Go to sleep, sweetie. Don't be scared. Don't be such a scaredy-cat. Just go to sleep, OK? Where was he going? Think. The other side. He plucked up all his courage and began his journey. He was finally there. The other side. Thank you. Want to play? -No. Maybe later, OK? -That's fine. Don't forget that he'd never seen so many non-annoying people together. Freaky. This is a case of national interest. -No one can leave or enter. -Understood. These two scientists can't leave the island under any circumstances. They have to come up with a solution, but if they can't, more drastic steps will follow. -Like? -Classified. Men! Get to it! -Who's that woman? -He cycled as fast as he could. He could think of only one person he had to share this with. -You're ignoring my question. -Correct. -Yes? What's up? -Is Aafje here? No, she isn't. -Who are you? -Hunter, a friend from school. I see. Well… -Bye. -But it's about you guys too. -What did you say? -It's about… Listen… Hunter, right? Hunter, you have to leave. My husband, Frank, is doing yoga. And… It's completely stuck. He's stuck in the Upward-Facing Sun Dog. So… Bye. But the bridge is being… Still not awake. We gave him too much. You didn't calculate the Body Mass Index properly. Apes have a lot more muscles. You should have done it. It was your idea. Why are you being so annoying? OK, so now what? Good God. Hello? I'll remove the tape, but don't scream, please. We won't hurt you. This is just scientific research. -In one go, OK? -Yeah. There you are. I looked everywhere for you. I crossed the bridge. -It is kind of different. -Yeah, I can't wait to go back. Aafje, I'm really sorry, but they're closing off the bridge. -They were soldiers. -What? If your dads don't come up with a solution soon… Then what? I don't know. It sounded scary. Those dads won't manage. They're very stupid. Exactly. That's why they decided to solve this problem together. -Has everyone always been annoying here? -Yes, as far as I know. So we have to know exactly when it all started. I've got an idea. This book is 30 years overdue, sweet pea. The fine is… -20,000. -Toodle-oo. Come on, let's look around. Here. "After 1415, more and more strange incidents occurred on the island." The year 1415. What happened then? We have to find that out. Right, Hunter? Right? Absolutely. Hello? You're very loud. I can hear you're piercing, childish voices all the way over here. Well, that helped. Could you please stop that. Just killing time during my capture. Don't whine. You're keeping me here. He does have a point. No… Yes, here. There should be an old religious book that deals with the origin of the island and its history. Aisle E14, number 304. The Chronicles of the Wolgengouw. The Chronicles of the Wolgengouw should be in aisle E14, but we can't find it. It's been borrowed, whiners. -Who by? -I'm not telling you, little busybody. Give me that name, or I'll scream. GONE OUT FOR LUNCH There's no way she's going to give us that name. -I'll distract her. -OK. Hey, stop that. Come here, you. That's wonderfully annoying. Thank you. Hello? Can somebody help me? Shush, silence. SILENCE Hello? -Got it. -Let's go. You're walking so fast. Just relax. Aafje, are you OK? Yeah, I think so. Come on. -Yes? -Mr. Brummer? -Yeah, who wants to know? -We're library volunteers. -You still have a book in your possession. -Oh, no idea. Bye. -Yes? -Your fine is mounting. -Who's there? -No one, Mom. -Tell them to go away. -Stay out of it. Go take a bath. -It's my house. I won't stay… -Mom, you're driving me crazy. -No. -Mom… -Strangers in my house, Peet. -They're from the library. -They have to leave me alone. -Come on, Mom, you need a bath. -I don't feel like it. -Come on. Mr. Brummer, if you hand in the book now, you don't have to pay a fine. -What's that kid saying? -Stay out of it. -Which book are you talking about? -The Chronicles of the Wolgengouw. I don't want a bath. -That will be difficult, sorry. -Is it on the shelves? -No, it isn't on the shelves. -Are you sure? I do know where it is, though. Just wait. What are those kids doing here? Do they want give me a bath too? -No, Mom, they don't. -Yes, they do. I know what's going on. I know them. Children are difficult. You were a difficult child too. Mr. Brummer? It's got the proper height, otherwise it will wobble. Those dirty little fingers. Will you keep standing like that? I've got nothing else to do, anyway. Are you deaf? Almost. But I heard that one. Come on. I'm going to count down from five to zero, and at zero you'll fall in a nice, deep sleep. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Gosh, honey. OK, listen to my voice. Think about all the annoying things you've ever done and still want to do. Can you picture them? Very good. Together, we're going to put them away in a small room in your mind. Put them in it. Now you lock the room. You take the key and give it to me. When I snap my fingers, you'll wake up. You'll feel calm and clear, and you'll never again do anything annoying. What is this? I think I've never… felt… this way before. -Really? -No, of course not, losers. It's written by some monk. 1400... 1408. Fourteen… Ah, here it is. "May, 1415, the year of our Lord. After four failed crops in a row, we finally found the cause of all our misery. A witch, living at a lake in the woods, has been the cause of everything." So that why it's called Witch Lake. "All the villagers advanced to the lake." The witch was found by us in her encampment, where it reeked of sulfur. The devil was at work here, that much was clear. It was time to deliver the village from this evil yoke. I daren't do it. -Neither do I. -Let me. All right, witch, your wicked plans have been foiled. Upsy-daisy. Nothing can stop me, not even this very handsome monk. I curse this island and all its inhabitants. You'll be very annoying for all eternity. -The curse. -Yes. Now he finally knew why. It's a curse. Everyone here has been cursed, so they can't help it. There's only one way to lift the curse. And that's by blowing up the entire island. Blowing up the entire island? What a cruel, creepy witch. -Weren't you scared, monk? -No, of course not. Come, everyone to the church. I'll give a very special sermon, so you'll feel a bit better. A medal for this remarkable man, immediately. I'd saved the day and night again. Thanks to me… "…everyone was able to sleep peacefully and without worry. The witch's curse absolutely didn't seem to affect the village. Especially not me." So a curse and it can't be lifted. -Aafje, the island is cursed. -That shirt you're wearing… Isn't it a bit, like, a statement? -How long have you been on this island? -I don't know. Aafje? He noticed something about her. She seemed changed. She now was… different, like everyone else in his life. Let's go. Don't want to. Right, Daphne, it's been hermetically sealed here. Yet, this brilliant reporter was able to reach the island on a horribly rickety boat. I also managed to get the address of the two scientists. Time for a conversation. There they are. We're going to interrogate them. -Gentlemen, how's the investigation going? -No comment. You've been on the island for a week. Are you making progress? Can the Prime Mister be cured, for example? You'd best ask the "brilliant" scientist Boudewijn. Well, the "genius" Frank knows a lot more about it. Boudewijn is really the expert… There are your dads. Guys, Aafje is acting annoying too. We were in the library and we know what's going on. We were cursed by a witch. That's why it's called Witch Lake. It was recorded by some monk. Everyone who comes to this island becomes annoying. Do you hear me? Everyone who goes to this island becomes annoying. Why aren't you at school? I don't want you to skip school. Come on, I'll take you there. Skipping school. A growing problem in our society. How does it feel to do nothing all day, just lazing about? Paid for by our taxes. What's it like? Hey, what's it like? What the… Did we get that? Great television. Love it. …cursed by a witch. That's why… Guys, Aafje is acting annoying too. We were at the library and we know what's going on. We were cursed by a witch. That's why… Guys, Aafje is acting annoying too. We were… Julia? -Yes, ma'am? -Put Plan B in action. What was Plan B again? Call… -De Beuker. -De Beuker? Are you sure? Shouldn't we give those scientists a bit more… Yes, ma'am. -Yes? -De Beuker, ma'am. Already? That's a record. Send him in, Julia. You get complete authority. Bring this boy here. He's the only one who isn't annoying. He could be the key to solving this mess. De Beuker? I want a clean operation. How can we lift the curse? Blowing up the island isn't an option. So how? Does this shirt look good on me? Hey, look. All these nice dots. It's funny. Hunter, could you come here for… Come on, keep going. -I'm exhausted. Can we take a break? -No, keep going. Quickly, run. -What do you want, blondie? -Come on, Aafje, run. -Get in. -Get in. Who are you? That creepy woman is probably going to kill us. -I've been watching you for a while. -Creep. -Why? -I owe you an explanation. I'm Lidia. I'm the only living descendent of Amarantha. -Amarantha? -The witch of Witch Lake. She was my great-great-great- great-great-great-grandmother. So why didn't you do anything? And why does the island need to be blown up to lift the curse? -That makes no sense. -What he said. Amarantha was a mega bitch with that curse. I get that you're angry, Hunter, but that's not what happened. That book, that story of the monk, is not right. I'll tell you what happened exactly. Amarantha, my kind great-great-great- great-great-great-grandmother, lived with her daughter Lilly at, well, what you call Witch Lake now. -Mom, look what I found. -It's beautiful. The island was afflicted by failed crops. The farmers had no grain. Food was scarce. As always, the unknown is blamed. This one is my new favorite. Come. Crawl into this. Whatever happens to me, sweetheart, no one is allowed to see you. OK? Lie down. Get her. Lilly couldn't do anything but watch. I just don't understand. The sour milk. Of Gertie's cows. That monk wasn't at all like how he's portrayed in that book. Remember what he looked like? Upsy-daisy. It wasn't quite like that. He was very stupid and terribly ugly. The monk had the tendency to pretend he was more handsome and better than he was, and other people worse. And he wrote it down too. Behold the cause of all this evil. This Satanist, Amarantha. You're mistaken. You are. Only God can help you now. She wasn't a witch after all. Sorry! The villagers wanted to leave, but Amarantha still had a surprise in store for them. I curse this island and anyone who comes ashore here. Well… I'll write down that last thing she said, just to be sure. One moment. Where's my quill? "I curse this island and anyone who comes ashore here." Or was it "everyone who comes ashore here"? Same thing, isn't it? Yep, got that. Continue. Amarantha blew on the shell… and the curse stormed across the Wolgengouw. Wait a minute. Isn't there always a counter spell to lift the curse? -Yes, that's true. -Now that you mention it. Come on. That's the way it's supposed to be. My kind great-great-great- great-great-great-grandmother wasn't a bad sort and she obeyed. Well, all right then. If an islander, a child, finds this magic shell and blows on it, then and only then, the curse will be lifted. That was the last thing people saw of Amarantha. But, as usual, the monk wasn't paying attention. -What was that last thing she said? -I don't know. -Something about blowing. -Blowing up the island or something. -Yes, that's it. -Whatever. "To get rid of the curse, the island has to be blown up." There. Guys, I'm going to give a wonderful, inspiring sermon in the church. -Your stupid sermons are boring. -Yeah, we're going home. Bye-bye, stupid bald loser. -So that shell still exists. -Yes. As long as a child doesn't blow on it, the curse will not be lifted. Yo, looks slick, dude. Not. -Hunter. -What about Hunter? Can't you talk in complete sentences? You're so weird The way you stand there Strange blond hair It looks stupid and not tough I'm not going to tell you Where my brother is Because I don't know myself I'd rather be in the club Bitches around me Drink in my mouth And you're not allowed in 'Cause you're too old -That doesn't rhyme. -It's about the flow, geezer. -And? Good news, I hope. -No, ma'am, not yet. Please don't mess it up. Find him. That boy knows more. Yes, ma'am. You say "yes, ma'am" You're under her thumb Your mysterious behavior Doesn't make you cool You're a complete failure -What is that? -A rap. -It doesn't rhyme. -It's about… the flow. Find that kid. Now. But why am I not annoying? By some odd twist of fate, you were immune to the curse. Yes, Hunter. By some odd twist of fate, you were immune to the curse. Hunter… Your hearing. Your ear. Of course. Because of my ears, the shell can't influence me. The curse has lasted long enough. And the island has been punished enough. You're the only islander who can lift the curse. Let them go. Stay here. Hunter, you have to lift the curse before it's too late. Find the shell and blow on it. You're the only hope. The only hope for the island. They had no choice. They were taken to the head office of the SSGB. -What does that stand for? -The Secret Service… Nice, Dad. Aafje? -You don't understand. I have to go. -Stay. -Who are you? -Sit down, Hunter. Hunter… how long have you been living on the island? All of my life. Why? So how it is possible that you're the only one -who isn't annoying? -I couldn't hear the tone from the shell. -Shell? -We thought the curse couldn't be lifted. -That's what it said in the book. -Wait a minute. -Book? -Yes, in my backpack. Julia… But that book isn't right. The monk wrote it down wrong. You have to let me go. I need to go back to the island. "The witch's eyes seemed to spew fire. Her voice sounded like icicles drilling through… our souls. That's how she continued." "There's only one way to lift the curse, and that's by blowing up the entire island, she said." -We have to blow up the island. -I can read, Julia. That book isn't right. The monk wrote it down wrong. Listen, you have to let me go. I have to blow on the shell. Julia. -Sorry, Hunter, you have to stay here. -No, you have to listen. Put me through to the army base immediately. Bergsma speaking. Ma'am. Sorry, could you repeat that? This isn't a drill? The entire island has to be destroyed? One moment. Launch code. Yes. Yes. Yes. The code is identical. Orders received. Control out. Start the launch procedure. Turn that off. Now. -Come on, Aafje, let's go. -No way. I'm watching TV. Come… 7-7-5-0. Command speaking. Fatboy fifteen minutes till target. I repeat: Fifteen minutes till target. What does this have to do with science? This'll be fun. Guys, isn't this going too far? -Where was he going? -To the place where it all began. Witch Lake. The water. -Shit. -His biggest fear. He knew it was the only way, so he put his fear aside. He took a deep breath and plunged into the water. He swam deeper and deeper. And then… deep down a strange glow. He saw something shiny among the rocks. The shell. Amarantha's shell. But the shell was stuck. He couldn't shift it. …7-5-0. Command speaking. Fatboy approaching target. I repeat: -Fatboy is approaching the island. -Roger that. It's a go. Affirmative. Five minutes to target. Everything seemed lost. But then there was a voice. You're the only hope. The only hope for the island. With his last strengths, he pulled hard on the shell. -So what do we have here? -Oh, no. No, I won't hand out a yellow card for a dive anymore. No, don't. No. No. -Are we diving for shells? -Come on, give it to me. Give it to me. Come and get it. You really aren't allowed to blow on it. Why not? That's classified. -So I'm not allowed to blow on it? -No, just don't. Hunter. -Guys, I feel like having ice cream. -Yes, good idea. Can you read minds or something? Oh, sorry. So sorry. That feather was actually kind of pleasant. -What? -That feather felt good. I… I don't know how, but… I think we did it. I'm not annoying anymore. The curse has been lifted. What's she doing here? Take her away. Wait. Let her talk. -Excuse me? -Listen to what she says. -Hunter managed to blow on the shell. -Hunter? Escaped. Apologies. Stop. Let her go. Listen carefully to what I have to say. You'll have the deaths of all the islanders on your conscience. Is that what you want? Lidewij, is that really what you want? -Mrs. de Wit, it's good you're calling. -Sir? I just talked to the Prime Minister of Canada. Apparently, I threw a lump of potato salad in his face. -I offered my humble apologies. I'll call you right back. This is Mrs. de Wit from base control. Abort mission immediately. Do you copy? Over. 7-7-5-0. Command speaking. Can you repeat that? Abort mission. Abort mission. Aafje. Roger that. Fatboy returns to base. 7-7-5-0. Command out. I have chronic bronchitis. -Oh, the suspension nearly killed me. -Imagine what it was like for them. -Aafje. -You did it. We did it. -Sorry about being so annoying. -It wasn't your fault. No, but… Are you staying for dinner, Aafje? I'm ordering shawarma. This ends this uncertain period for these once so annoying islanders.

So I'm the hero, actually. Well, shall I sign your little book then? Shouldn't you talk to her a bit longer? I think Elise was the only one who was rather annoying of her own accord. -Who for? -Amarantha. -There you go. -Thank you, hero. Amarantha? -Whoa, Amarantha herself? -Yes. -Was she still alive? -No idea. Perhaps. Or maybe it was her spirit, or a memory left behind. -You said it really happened. -Yes. Everything. And the book even became a great success. But the most important thing was… He now felt at home somewhere. And trust me, you will here as well. Thanks, Dad. But wait a minute. A very well-known book.
