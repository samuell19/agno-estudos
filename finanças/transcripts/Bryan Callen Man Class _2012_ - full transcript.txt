BRYAN CALLEN: Got lines in my face. I don't... I should have gotten my hair cut or something. That's... that's... I'm losing my hair in the weirdest way. And this... I don't know if this shirt works, 'cause this is all wrinkly here. I don't even know if this makes me skinny or what. I just feel as though I could have used another week. You done? Your life is a lie. Do you understand me? I don't really like the way you're putting that. I just feel as though I'm, um... Your boobies getting all full and stuff? Huh, your boobies aching? Huh? You disgust me. But I've got to go teach a man class, now. Okay? Maybe get a couple girls pregnant in the process. Confuse a couple guys about their sexuality. And most importantly, bring some comedy heat. I'll see you later. I can't listen to this anymore. Don't fail. Maybe I was too hard on him. (thunder rumbles) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Bryan Callen. (audience cheering, applauding) CALLEN: Yes, I say yes! Gets me excited! Look at my fingers. I didn't even plan that. You guys got my fingers all erect and whatnot. What's going on? What a crowd. Nah, God, congrat, what... Congratulations on that moustache, my friend. That's an aggressive moustache. And there's another one, we don't play around. And you've got that... You got... it's not even hair, it's a fucking mane. It's a mane, man! And curly. It's wavy. It looks like a ski slope, only black. Looks like you're wearing a couple crow wings or something. Perfect for framing your moustache. Looks like a squirrel tail or something. I had a whole act, and I come out and I see that. What to do with that? It's amazing. Dude, listen, let me explain something. First of all, you don't always have to wear it like that. Maybe just sit in your eyes. Let it sit in your eyes, and eat a peach. You ever just eat tropical fruits? You're standing in the doorway, and you just... Let the juice drip down and catch in your moustache? Oh, butterflies! They land on your moustache! They love peach! Mm! And butterflies. Then you breathe in and they're like this, and you breathe out and they're like... I'll do my whole act on his facial hair. (audience applauding) You just got to... A man's got to know how to use his feathers, man. We don't have any help from an industry. Got to know how to use your body, man. On a scale from one to ten, I'm a five. Solid, okay? Like, as a comic, they always give you a stool. You go to a bar, they give you a stool. Teach you a couple things, okay? I don't sit on stools. All right? That's how you kill yourself before you get out of the gate. Okay? You walk in, wore your new outfit, you're like, all right, ladies. Nice. I'm a grown man. My feet don't reach the ground. Look at this. That doesn't make a girl want to breed with you. What do you do? I never know, what are you going to do? A little swim kick, does that turn you on? When I do that? Huh, you like that? Or should I tuck my feet? Now I tuck. Most of the time we tuck. We're not even sitting, I'm perching. Like a birdie or a kitty-cat. Okay? Grown men don't perch. I'll show you how you turn heads when you're a regular guy. Okay? Scale of one to ten, I'm a five. Solid, okay? So I walk in and I gotta get their attention right away. What do I do? I don't know. I don't even walk in. I just start popping my legs. Yeah, yeah. It's weird. She's like, why is that guy walking like a male chicken? Don't worry about it, honey, you're looking at me. That's the point. All right? Get to the stool. Moment of truth. She expects a kitty-cat, maybe a birdie. What's the kid do? Huh? I'm a five. Now I'm a seven. Aren't I? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Look at how flexible my upper groin is. My God, why is he caressing his own thigh? Because it's a free country, that's why. Look at that. Right there is the dirty undergrab goatee. You know what I'm talking about? Call that the DUG. These jeans are a little tight, I'm not going to lie to you. I wore them for the special. You guys want to see eight? Huh? (cheering) I don't care. I don't care. I give. I'm a giver. You got your seat belt on? You ready for eight? Look at that shit right there. Look at that. Do not try this at home, you will tear your sack. You understand me? Take my workshop before you try that. That's an advanced move. I'd show you a nine, but I'm not wearing the right pants. You want to see nine, I've got to be wearing my 1970's running shorts. Yeah, I said it. I said it. Everybody's shorts come down to here. Horse poo. I say, bring them high, bring them tight. I'll go a size too small. What do you think about that, OC? Huh? Yeah. Tell you what's good about that. You walking, riding high, you throw a leg up, what happens? Listen, women can show off a little cleavage, I can't show off a little... (clicks tongue) You know what I'm saying? Don't show the whole thing. I'm not trying to be vulgar, just a little bit. Just the nubs, because women like subtlety. They'll look, too. They will look. They'll be like, "Oh, my, is that what I...? Is that what I think? Oh, my God. Hey, hey, hey, hey." Easy, looky-loos! Man... Moustache, don't show the whole thing. A lot of my students go overboard, trying to be extra sexy. You show the whole thing, it just ends up looking like somebody threw a dead baby bird against your leg. Okay? It's a disgusting metaphor, but I'm educated. I use metaphors. I've got to get this stool out of here. I, uh, is my assistant back there? Get my assistant. I don't do my own stuff. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, look at that. That's... yeah. That's... That's Jeremy Piven. That's Jeremy. He delints me. He delints me. Delint. He's delinting me. He delints me. Thanks. Thank you. He's telling me I'm doing an amazing job. Thank you. PIVEN: The Prius is fired up ready to go. Whenever you're done. CALLEN: Yeah, I'll be done in about an hour, though. Thank you so much. (cheering) Right there. Now, what's... what's the lesson? What's the point of that? To show you I've got A-list celebrity friends? That I make a ton of money? That cost me 20 grand. Don't worry about it, all right? It's not the point. The point is, if you can afford to have an assistant like that, a famous assistant... gets you laid. Not a waver, by the way, either. I don't do this. I don't know who invented this. This is not... This is... there's nothing masculine about that. Don't ever do that. You go to a bar, like hi. I got caught in a double wave one time. They were like, oh, my God, hi. Oh, my God. What is that? No. No. Girl says hi to me in a bar, bang, I point. Look at that. See that? Isn't that more masculine? Yeah. No, how you doing? I throw it right back at them. Watch me get out of it. Ready? Yeah. Just a little trick. I holstered my point. Never seen that. I can point to this whole room if I want. I'm not going to show off. I'm not doing that just to, you know... I've already showed you what I got going on over here. I can get you all. In fact, if there's a group that's a problem. A lot of times there's a group of women, or you know, a group of people, and you point like that, you create confusion. Because they're like, you know, is he pointing at me or what? So you got to have other techniques. (clears throat) You want to see my technique? What? I'm not baiting you. I'm not baiting you. I'm just saying. I just want to say, people like, that's impossible. How you going to point to everybody? I don't know, how about like that? Look at that. Yeah. Five finger underpoint. Look at my knee. All right? Yeah, I'm getting everybody. And you guys with my thumb. Just 'cause. Yeah, it's awesome. All right? You know why that's awesome? Because you hit a bunch of women like that, you're like, what's up, ladies? They're like, oh, my God, he points like a wizard. Uh-huh. Yeah. I know. And by the way, if you're a nerd, don't come up to me after the show, like, excuse me, um, wizards point like... I've had that a couple times, where like, wizards... you were pointing... they actually point... I know how a wizard points. I don't want to get into a conversation about wizardry with you. Okay, nerd? How about that? I'm an adult. It's a bad habit anyway. Never do the authentic wizard point, ever. That's a mess. Always, please, underpoint. Always underpoint, never overpoint. Always under, never over. Always... I can't say it enough. Why? You get in the habit of this all the time? You're like, hey, hey, what's up, man? Aha, I'm a wizard, that's fine. The problem is, sometimes you've got people in the upper rows, balconies, second story, and they're like, hey, how are you? You can't be like, what's up, how are you guys? Yeah. Now I'm a Nazi bastard. You see that? You see how you go from sexy wizard to huge A-hole with the swivel of your wrist? Yeah. And this is a beautiful thing about life, the way you use your body sends off all the right or the wrong signals. You get caught in the white power salute, I'll show you how easy it is to get out of. You get excited, you're like, hey, what's up? They're like, oh, my God, he's a Nazi. All you got to do is bring your fingers in. Now we got black power, motherfucker. You see that? I'm so inclusive. It's tough being a regular straight guy, too. In this society, we live in a very puritanical, homophobic society. You just can't do certain things. You can't be too expressive with your body. You can't, you can't, you just can't... You know? You can't... You can't announce yourself. You can't... â™ª I'm here. You can't do that. You can't walk in. I've always wanted to, you know, just... You can't frolic through wheat. That's oh, I've... No matter how, like, stressful my day I can never just run through wheat. And just forget my sorrows, you know what I mean? Never! Women never go, oh my God that's so hot, he's frolicking. They never, not once, in the history of man. You can't run through that same wheat field like this. You can't drag a hand over the wheat, either. You can't do that. I never... There's no manual for it, I just know that's not allowed. It's about sending a different signal, that's all. You know? It's funny too, when guys... I noticed, I was at a game the other day, and guys cheer like this. Like they, they've got to, you know. If you're like, Yeah! If you're cheering your team on, or you're at a concert, or what. Yeah! We're number one! It's this. See how I've got the little bend here? This area gets a lot of oxygen. And I'm here, right here, right? That's how guys... Yeah! (whoops) Number one! You'll never see your buddy, like... (whoops) We're number one! You can't lock the knees and the elbow at the same time. You can't do that. It's funny. Straight guys will never lock their knees, and... You never lock the joints. I'll tell you a story. I thought about that because my buddy... I don't like making fun of anybody for being gay, or I just never thought it was funny because I got, you know. My buddy's... I have a friend who's a drag queen. And he's... I grew up with him. Very gay. Uh, like, really, like feathers, the whole thing. He's literally, like, you know, the kind of guy who's like, when I'm with him, I've had other gay men come up and go, uh, your friend's a little hmmm, you know? And, uh, yeah. So, uh... So this guy brought out a snake. And I don't like snakes. Okay? So, I, I was with my other friends and my buddy, Jay. And I assumed the standard I don't like snakes stance. The standard straight guy I don't like snakes stance. Which is a little here. You see? Look, again, a bend in the knees, here. I'm low here, and I-I'm ready, I'm ready in case I've got to punch the snake in the fangs. Right? And that-that's how, if you ever look at, like regular, straight guys, they-they always... There's always a little hunch to the shoulders. There's always a little... I think it goes back to hunting. I think it goes back to cave man days, where, you know, when you're hunting deer, you got to stay... you've got to have a little give because you're under... You're staying under the foliage, here. You can't... If you have good posture, they see your head. You know what I mean? You're spooking the deer with your posture. So you've got to stay under here like that. And then you got to push off here. It's always, when you spear a deer, but then again, that rustling may not be a deer. It could be a tiger, so you got to fucking fight it, you know. But hunting, fighting posture, which is what men live in, that's because life is that way. It's a hunt and a fight. Which is deep. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, but we'll touch on that. We'll touch on that subject in a second. But here's the thing. So, back to the snake. Okay, so the guy... So I-I'm like, keep the snake away, and all my buddies are doing a variation on that theme. Like, I don't want the snake. And my buddy, my... Jay, the drag queen, he, I swear to God, he's looking at the snake like this: I was like, Jay, you look like a penguin under arrest. That's what I said, because I'm witty. You can't do that. You can't... You can't defend against a snake. You're making yourself a bigger target. You can't keep a permanent snarl, like I don't like that. You never see me out... This-the world is too dangerous to be standing ever like a penguin or anything like that. You just can't... You can't. It's just... it's too dangerous. There are too many tigers in the tall grass, man. There really are. Read the newspaper. You watch the news, you better be always ready. I'm always, you never see me out of this position. I'm just always looking around like that. That's how guys are. People are too relaxed. I see people... I look at you... That's why the only time I'm out of the hunt-fight posture is when I'm sleeping. And that's probably why I don't sleep very well. Because you never see me napping in a public place. Like in a park. I don't understand. That's like a... And you'll never see me take a nap on the side of the road. That's the crazy... There are too many maniacs. I'm always looking for maniacs. The minute you lock your knees, you become bait, okay? You stop being a hunter, and you're bait for the maniacs. They're out there looking for locked knees. Speaking metaphorically again. They're gonna teach this one-hour special in literature class. But anyway, the point I'm making is this: like, like, you got to just, you know, like, like I-I but that's, sleeping is the... I don't sleep well. I'm just always ready. I wake up like a little kitty-cat, like... at the littlest sound like that. My mother told me to take a nap on the side of the road one time. I told her I was falling asleep. She goes, "Oh, just pull over. Take a nap on the side of the road." Excuse me? Uh, not a shot. That's the dumb... I would, that's the cra... Are you out...? Turn myself into maniac bait? Are you out of your mind? I'll die in my sleep at the wheel. I'd way rather die in... I fall asleep, die in a crash. Die in a fiery place. I'll take that shit over being well-rested, waking up on the side of the road tied to my car seat while some maniac is stabbing my face in. Rise and shine! No way. No way. I'm not dying like that. No way. It's a... It's like, it's like the same thing when people, like, stop their car and they wave you across like that. I see people lollygagging. Like, dee-dee, thank you very much. I don't know about that. Somebody stops their car like that, why's this guy stopping? That's weird. Grown man stopping his car like that? I'm always ready, man. Always. Always, always. 'Cause you know there's always that maniac. This is a true story. There was nun behind a wheel. This is a bad story about me, but the nun waved us across, with my buddy. My buddy goes, "Let's go." I go, "I don't know." He goes, "It's a nun." I go, "Or it's a maniac dressed like a nun?" It's a perfect maniac costume, okay? All maniacs have a nun costume. It hangs right next to the Santa costume, okay? I don't have data on it, but that makes sense, doesn't it? Yeah. I crossed. I'm not a freak. I crossed, but I was waiting. I just had one eye peeled like that, just daring that nun. Aha! Not this guy, nunny! You just be careful of that shit. And if he's smiling at you... fuck you. Smile at me. That's a dead giveaway of a maniac. Smile. Grown men don't smile. The older you get, the less you smile. That's a fact. You been through too many wars. How many dads or grandpas you know who, are like, walking around like... Grown men don't even smile on vacation. My dad started frowning the minute we started packing our bags. He spent the whole vacation looking for somebody to rip him off, like this. He was right. You see a grown man smiling at you randomly for more than three seconds, walk away. He's either a freak or he's selling you something you don't need. I'm telling you. You've got to just be always... It's just... It's why I got to stay in shape. You can't tell what I got going on, but believe me, I take my shirt off, you guys would fucking flip. No, no, no, no, that's not, that's not why. I can't anyway. I'm wearing a leotard. But, um, it's nothing weird. Just after the show, there's this wealthy older gentlemen I do some private dancing for. I don't want to talk about. It's not a big deal. He wants me to throw on a blonde wig and scrub his floor while he calls me "Dutch boy." It's his 150 bucks. You know what I'm talking about, goatee? You know what I'm talking about. My rent's paid on time! Got to keep in shape, man. You got to just stay, you know, just keep the belly tight and the arms heavy. That's the other thing. Otherwise, you start looking soft. You start looking appetizing. Guys know that, though. We have an instinct for that stuff, guys, you know. But the problem is, you know, you got to look like you can handle yourself with your bare hands, but we don't do anything with our bare hands. You know, that's the thing about... That's the bummer about technology. Technology is moving so fast, we don't do anything with our bare hands. You know, men are still producing testosterone. We're still bigger, stronger and in a lot of ways more aggressive, but there's, you know, we're losing habitat. Unless you're a cage fighter, or, like, a Marine or a fireman, the rest of us, all we have is the gym. There's nothing else. There's nowhere else to burn it off, but we still, you know. We still do these crazy P-1-7 whatever, you know. It's the cra... Guys'll do shrugging like that. My buddy was doing this the other day with weight. I-I was like, what are you... what are you doing? "I'm working my traps, you idiot. What's it look like I'm doing?" Because that's a very important area. We sit in the gym, and we ride, you know, bicycles that go nowhere and run on belts just so our cardio is where it should be in case the tiger takes us into the second or third round. Got to have good cardio. And-and bench. Bench is another classic example of the breeding instincts/ fight-hunt instinct gone wild. Guys, 'cause you've got to have a chest. Guys spend a summer trying to get 300 pounds off their... They'll do what ever they got... (grunting) You know, they'll shoot themselves up with testosterone, with human growth, it doesn't matter. The only thing weak on them is their liver, their kidneys, and their dick. It's worth it. It's worth it, if they can get 300 pounds because, you know, you always use this in the wild, in case somebody throws a car engine on your chest. Right? Right? And then you've got some guy, you don't even know teabagging you the whole time. It's like a... It's worth it! I can't do it. I can't go to the gym. I can't. I can't. I just feel too artificial. I can't. My buddy was doing this the other day. He was kicking like that in front of a TV with one of these exercise programs. Like that. I-I was, like, "What are you doing? "He goes, Nah, this gets your ass. I'm bubbling my ass. It gets the ass. It really gets the bubble." I had to punch him in the face on principle, okay? It's not how a man gets his body. A man gets his body by doing man stuff. That's way sexier, I think, to a woman, if you just, you know, you do, you work the land. You know, you split wood, you bail hay, you take your girl from behind. Whatever it is, you know? Gets you in shape. So much better. So much better, man. That's, you know... Women are taking Viagra now because we're... because men don't, can't do man stuff. You got in shape in the old days. You had to work the land. Fuckin', you had to bale hay. I don't even know how to... I don't know if that's how you do it, but that's how I... And you got to split wood. You're splitting wood. You're popping your hips like that. Yeah, yeah! Dude, you should. Then you'll... Your hair, like this. You should always split wood. Eh! Oh, oh, it's awesome. Then you just sit back and... You're just maybe wearing a pair of baggy pants tied off with a rope. Maybe no pants. Maybe just rope, I don't know. Take a peach break. Mm-hmm. Come home, and you smell like she's baking you a pie. You come home and she's baking you a pie. And you smell like wood and hay and peach. That's a great smell. Beats the hell out of smelling like protein powder and baby oil. Right? Everything is simulated. Everything. Just feel that way. I just want to... Just, I miss the old days. We've got to get back to that stuff. Technology has a downside is all I'm trying to say. We used to catch our own food. Come on, man. That's so sexy. You catch your own food? Come on. What a way to tell a woman you love her. You just go out there, and you're, like, "I'll be right back, baby." You know what I mean? "I want a hamburger." "Take you to Mickey D's, and maybe I'll just catch you a cow, honey." Throw a big, old, angry stallion between your legs. "I'll be right back, baby. Hyah!" You're just fucking riding him. Look at that. That's my technique. It's not even good. I don't care. No hands. Look at that. No hands! No hands! By the way, horses... My buddy, you know, that's the other thing. Horses are... My buddy bought a 400- horsepower $200,000 Porsche, or whatever. Like this really expensive, I don't know what it was. And he opens the hood. I don't know much about cars. And he goes... And I was, like, I don't know. I was, like, "Oh." And he didn't like that reaction, so he went... I didn't know what I was... Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! What does he want from me? I don't know anything. And then he's revving the engine like... (mimics engine revving) I'm like, "Oh, my... He's, like, "Yeah! 236 miles an hour! Tell me that sound doesn't give you a boner, bro." (mimics revving) I was, like, "That's incredible. 236 miles an hour. Dude, if there was no traffic or speed limits, you would kill everybody." I'm telling you. You might have... Come on, man. You got a horse. I'll get right up on a horse. What a way... Women, I don't give a shit, you ride up on your 400- horsepower car, I ride up in a one-power horse; sexier. Sexier. That's what you did. Back in the day, that's what you did! You just rode. You know, if you wanted to meet a woman, it was just... You didn't have to fucking meet her, you just rode by just... Hey, mine! You know? It's illegal, but it's romantic. People'd be, like, "How'd you guys, how'd you guys meet?" "Meet? I fucking stole her, bro." Oh, Jesus. So many things you can do on a horse, man. A lot of things I want to do before... Like, I've always wanted to rescue a group of women on a horse. You know what I mean? They're just in the wilderness, covered in leaves 'cause they lost their clothing in the accident. Maybe they're surrounded by wolves? Fucking wolves! (howls) "Oh, my God, I'm so cold. We're going to die. The wolves." But guess what? The wolf whisperer comes riding up with that hair and that moustache. I don't even need the tail on my horse. I just snip it 'cause I don't want to compete. Yeah. I look like a centaur. All I'm wearing is that rope, remember? And I just feel the backbone on my taint. It's too much information. It's just my private fantasy. (grunting) I just ride up, and they're, like, "Thank God. Thank you, wolf whisperer. What about the wolves?" I just look at the wolves. I'm, like, (growling). Yeah. Which means, "Get the fuck out of here, wolves!" Or because we're shooting a special, "It's get the F out of here, wolves!" That's me trotting them to safety. Then we got to make, we got to make camp, and I got to feed them, and I'm-I got my peach hip basket. I give them peaches. How hot would that be, as they're eating peaches, and I'm splitting wood to make a fire? But we don't have any matches. Uh-oh. Guess I better rub two sticks together. Yeah, a lot of guys you see, like these Survivor guys, they're all crunched over like a little monkey doing this really fast. That's not how the wolf whisperer does it; slow, deliberate. Can you... can you really start a fire like that? (makes roaring flame sound) I believe every man chooses to be a coward or a hero. Someday, this is my number one. I think most men will identify with this, and I think most women will find it romantic. But I've always wanted to rescue, like, a sleepy town, like a sleepy little country town from a Nazi biker gang, you know? I've always wanted to do that. Like, in the movies, though, a lot of times, you know, they're beating up, they're, like, playing rag dolls with the girls and beating up the guys and drinking whiskey and whatever, and they're wearing bandaleros. That's Spanish for "bandaleros." And, uh, and, uh, you know, the guy comes in, and he's, like, "Hey, you guys, I think the lady doesn't want to dance with you anymore. You mind if I cut in?" Or whatever. They use some bullshit dance metaphor, and then they... They do all their kung-fu, and then they... Okay, these movies, like, in the '70s, but you know what I mean. Let me show you how you do it. You've got to fight a biker gang, okay, this is what you do, all right? This is how you do it. You got to... If you got fight a whole group of dudes, like a badass biker gang, you don't just come in like that. They don't just attack you one at a time like in the movies. They bum rush you, okay? So you got to get them on their heels, okay? And this is what you do. You send a messenger. You send somebody out there first to warn them. You got to get them spooked, okay? Now, I watch these nature shows, Discovery and stuff. They had an African medicine man, okay, on one of these programs. Like, a real-life... He had a bone tank top. He had a bone tank top, and, like, a leopard head on his head. That was his hat. That-that's your hat. He had a head like this. On his head! No chin strap, just stayed on. And he was doing this. This guy had ebola... (chanting in foreign language) And, and the hat wasn't... The leopard head stayed on his head. You know how? Magic, okay? And he's, like... And the guy who had ebola was, like, "Oh, thank you so much." You know, he walked away. Anyway, the point I'm making is that's who I want. That's who I send ahead of me before I come to kick some ass, okay? So the biker gang. They're in this sleepy country town, and they're doing all their wrongdoing. I don't really know how to mime wrongdoing, but you know, (makes fart sound) whatever they're doing, okay? And they're doing their thing, and-and I... And this is what they get interrupted by. They don't see me. They just see my African medicine man, Itwatdumela, they just see him, like... (chanting in foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) (makes clicking sounds) (prolonged shriek) Yeah. That'll get your attention. Okay? So what happens? Leader of the wrongdoers doesn't want to be spooked, so he's always like, "The hell's that crazy son of a bitch saying up there, speaking all that goddamned gibberish, getting in the way of my wrongdoing? Somebody go up there and kick his ass!" And they're all like, "Yeah!" But there's always some grizzled wrongdoer who speaks fluent Swahili or whatever, okay? Because, you know, he's a mercenary in Africa. He's always, "Hold on! Hold on. That ain't no crazy man. That's a real-life African medicine man. Congo. Deep forest. He ain't speaking gibberish." "What the hell is he saying?" "He's saying that the gods are angry, and their wrath rides near in the form of a slender, brown-eyed, white man. "And we should run because he will come and lay a reckoning on us so terrible that our screams for mercy will crack the very sky above us and bring birds from the sky and fish to land. And then he... I imagine this means we're going to get smashed, and then-- aah! I don't know. Maybe that's the way we're going to die." Already awesome, okay? Yeah. Now, if you know anything about African medicine men, you know that they can disappear just-- poof!-- like that, all right? And then guess who's standing in his place. That's right-- the kid. That's right. I'm just hanging out like this. Just fucking shredded. You can't, you know... but fucking... (makes popping noises) (imitates braying donkey) You know, whatever. I need the stand for this, all right? And I don't know why, but I got two, like, really hot girls clutching each calf like that. Yeah, it's my fantasy. I don't care. It's not... it's not good for mobility. I don't give a shit, all right? And I'm just standing there... (exaggerated Latin American accent): I got two machine guns! Two machine... (normal voice): That's Spanish for "machine guns." I just got... and I'm just... I just fucking... I just start spitting that. Just... (imitating rapid gunfire) That's the machine gun twirl, all right? Yeah, I invented that. But whatever. Of course, I run out of bullets, right? You run out of bullets, here's the best part. I just take my guns, and I just go... and drop them. Of course, the two girls are like, "What, are you fucking... are you out of your...?! You're such an idiot! Why didn't you bring more bullets? You're such an idiot! There's so many more of these Nazi bikers. We're gonna die!" I don't say shit. I just reach into my back, and I pull out two machetes. Two machetes! And then I do the machete dance. Ever seen that? I'll answer the question. No, you fucking haven't. That's the machete helicopter. Without machetes, it looks very... (mutters) With machetes, deadly. Anyway... Now, story goes on. So they're all dead. Here's the best part of the fantasy, okay? It's not even the best part. This is what every guy wants to do, okay? I want to get on my horse. You forgot about the horse. This is a horse fantasy. Yeah, I get on my horse, and I just ride. I just ride off into the sunset. The sun is setting, and I get to the hill where it all started, and I want to do this. I want to just pull my horse around like that, and I just want to do one of the... (neighs) Where my horse rears up, and it looks like a little, like, horsey boxer. Like... (grunts) He's doing that! Aah! He keeps it. He holds it. 'Cause I practiced it. And then the whole town's like, "Thank you, hero. Thank you." And I'm like, "No problem, town." (chuckles) My God. I'm out of breath. Yeah. What was I talking about? Oh, yeah. The point I'm making is that... I was talking about killing cows, wasn't I? Yeah. I like to wrangle cattle. I'm a... I grew up on a range. And, uh, you guys probably don't understand that. You guys are just city slickers. But I used to wrangle cattle, and that's a very sexy exercise. You wrangle cattle, you go out to your girl, "I'll be right back, I'm going to catch you a cow," that's very sexy to a woman. That's just old-school 'cause you got to stampede them. You stampede them, okay? And they... all these dogies are stampeding. Every time, there's always some dogie decides he's an individual and he'll stray from the herd. He just strays. And I love that 'cause I'm like, "What are you, an individual? Huh? You're a herd animal, you idiot." (grunts) "Yeah, that's right. Get back here, cowsy-powsy." All right? Pull my horse back. You pull a cow off its feet, it's a beautiful sound, man. Because, usually, a cow is like, "Moo. I like grass. Moo." You know? And "moo" doesn't mean anything. It just means "moo" 'cause they're idiots, okay? You pull a cow off its feet at a dead run, you know what you hear? "Moo!" Yeah, which means "holy fuck" in cow. Yeah. Then you jump off your horse like that and you tie his hooves up into what I call a hoof bouquet. Yeah, it's my little thing. Got a bouquet of the hooves. Guy will buy you a bouquet of roses, I'll make you a hoof bouquet. Here comes the ugly part. My girl is hungry, and I gots to kill the cow. A lot of guys will take a cow to a slaughterhouse. Mustache, you know how I kill my cows? I punch them in the face till they fucking die, okay? Sparta! (grunting) It's great exercise 'cause it takes fucking forever. It does. It takes forever to punch a cow to death 'cause they got that spongy nose like a shock absorber. Like, "Come on! My girl's hungry!" Apologize to any vegetarians out there. Yeah. I love animals. I hate cows. Had a bad experience with a cow when I was a boy. I was on my pa's farm. I was about seven or eight years old. I was milking away, trying to get some whole milk for my Rice Krispies. I think. A lot of it's a blur. Maybe I tugged an udder wrong. I don't know. I don't speak cow, okay? Not up on cow politics. All I know is I'm tugging away, okay, all happy as a clam, and the hoofed freak whipped around and bit me in my face. Yeah. Goatee, you ever sustain a cow bite to your face? Huh? You grow up real fast. You got a 1,700-pound milk machine latched onto your face with them flat, grass-stained teeth. Thing just shook me. Just... (grunting) I was like, "Mommy!" But Mommy wasn't around, so I had to go like that to its eye. That's what you do when an angry bovine grabs your face. You come out like the point and-- gank!-- right in the eye. 'Cause they wear their eyes on the side of their stupid cow faces. Thing let go right quick, too. Thing was like, "Moo!" Yeah, which means "my eye" in cow. Buy an eye patch. (mocking chuckle) Don't bite me in my adorable face anymore. That's me picking up my pail of milk. I finish every story with detail. That's how I walked. 'Cause I was cute. Point I'm making is we just pay a lot-- we just pay a price for technology. That's what I'm trying to say in a roundabout way. Just don't do... I just have a roundabout way of going about it. That's all. I like to give a lot of examples. But everything you do, you know, just everything... nothing is by bare hands. We don't use our hands anymore. Nothing's tactile anymore. Nothing. You don't use your muscle for anything. Back in the day, you didn't have supermarkets. That pail of milk... (chuckles) do some sexy things with a pail of milk. Do some disgusting things with a pail of milk. No, we have the Internet, but that's not what I'm talking about here, right? No, but you... with a... with a pail of milk, forget it. You just... you know what you do with that? You can make butter. Yeah, you go up to your girl, you be like, "I'll be right back, honey. I'm going to go make some butter." (gasps) "What?" Whatever. Just, that's proper technique. You got to get your... got to get your hips in there. Otherwise, your core gets too sore. Love churning butter. Always feel like a daring magician after I'm done. You know what I mean? What was milk is now butter. So I like to reward myself. I'll just give myself a reward. I'll just knife a hand, reach in, grab myself a liberal handful. I mean a liberal handful. I give myself a raw butter bath. (sighing) Let me tell you something right now. You want to spice up your love... your whole...? You want to spice up your love life? I don't care you've been married 25 years, your girl comes in, sees you giving yourself a butter bath, everything stops, okay? Every... I don't care how liberated, how educated. It's very hard to put that into context. That just taps right into the DNA. They just walk in, the purse drops. They're just like, "What the fuck are you doing in my living room?" "Nothing. Just giving myself a butter bath-- that's all. That ain't illegal, is it? I mean, you ain't the butter police, are you?" Fucking butter police? Holy shit, I'm getting horny. If she is the butter police, she better slap them cuffs on real tight, 'cause I guarantee my wrists will be all kinds of buttery. Yeah, and I might just slip out them cuffs. She's either going to want pancakes, or she's going to want to "F" to the "uck." No butter baths if you're hairy, please. That's disgusting. I got to just say that. Don't... hey, hey, you know, guys, he said... No, that's disgusting. Shave it; otherwise, flies... It's gross. Peach juice-- butterflies. Butter-- flies. I... that's my... I invented that. That's my poem. (chuckling) Fantastic, fanta... fantastic. Um, I just... look, you know, everything we do, it's efficiency and speed and technology. It's got its upside, man, but I just... like, even the way we communicate. I think there's a problem. I don't like the way we do... Everything we do-- we're even fighting wars like this. We're fighting wars with our thumbs. That's what's happening. And maybe it's good that we're fighting with machines, but there's something weird where you got guys in Florida and Nevada and they're killing bad guys with their thumbs 5,000 miles away with those drone aircrafts. You know, I thought about it, and I was like, you know, the... the war hero in 20 years isn't going to be the grizzled Marine with the scars and the shaved head; he's going to be the chubby dude with huge thumb muscles who smells like Doritos and weed. That's weird to me. And the way we communicate, we do the same thing with our thumbs. Like, "Hey, you're really hot. I had a good time." Send. "You know, you're really beautiful. I like your tits in that dress. LOL." You know? What happened to love letters? Love letters-- that's... nobody writes love letters anymore. That's... that's so romantic. That's so... you know, you're... that's how you... I remember the first love letter I got from my girlfriend, Karen Harrison, when I was 14 years old, and-and she wrote me this letter, and she... she cried onto the letter on purpose so that the tears ran the ink. Yeah, and it smelled like her perfume. And I remember just going... (sniffs) "Oh, that's..." You know, I was... I was 5,000 miles away, but it was amazing. You don't get that with this. And back in the old days, it was even more romantic 'cause you had to get a piece of papyrus or parchment or whatever the... I don't know. What the fuck is it called? Whatever. Either way, it cost you a... it was like a... took a month to save up to buy one piece of paper. And then you had to take a feather, and you dipped it in squid ink, and you wrote your... you wrote. And I don't... I don't even... anybody know how to get squid ink? Anybody? I have no idea. What a pain in the ass. You got to go get a boat, I guess, and a net, and catch squid, which I have no idea how to do, and then be like, "You... what are you doing?" "I'm catching squid." "Ah, calamari." "No, I got to write a love letter. It's fucking, you know..." Then you got to get the ink out of the squid, which-- do you squeeze them? Maybe you scare them. Like, "Boo!" You know, I don't... I'm being silly, but you know what I mean. Now you got your thing of ink, and after all that with the feather, and you dip it in the squid ink and you write. And you had to... and you wrote poetry. Poetry's dead. Poetry-- the reason you wrote poetry is because that's your one letter, man. After all that work, it better mean something. It's not just like, "Hey, had a good time. You look hot. Thanks." Like that, no. You had to write to the rhythm of your heartbeat, and you wrote something that really fucking mattered because you're getting laid. If that girl's going to give you what she's got... Back in the day, before penicillin, STDs were a serious issue, you understand? So you're stuck with one girl, and you wrote that thing, and then you sealed it. You just, you did this with it. You know, whatever. I don't know. What is the word for that? Rolled it? Yeah. You rolled it, and then you sealed it with wax, and you tied it to the leg of a pigeon, and you fucking sent it off. My God. That's incredible. No e-mail. I got pigeons. You just hope a hawk doesn't take him out of the sky on the way. Then your loved one doesn't know how you feel after all that work. Back in the old days, they were probably anti-hawk. Anyway. You know, but that's the thing. I just feel like, you know, style, taking your time for stuff. That's what makes life worth living. Like, what the... Why can't I wear a cape? Who decided capes were no longer in for guys? Back in the 1800's, everybody wore capes. There was a puddle, you took it off. There was a stray bull, you fought it. Whatever you did, you know what I mean? Capes were amazing. If there was a breeze, they're like "Oh, I'm cold." "I don't know what you're talking about." You can wrap it. You can wrap it. If there was a bee swarm, you're like, "Bees! Run! Find water!" Whatever. It's so multi-functional, man. You can just, and you just... They see you coming a mile away. You enter a room... They think it's a dust storm because... my cape's going to be crushed velvet, ruby red. It's going to drag on the ground and swirl dust. I'll tell you that much. I know, it's hard. Nowadays, you save 50 lives on national TV, you show up on Oprah the next day in a cape, douche bag. (laughter) Cape. I have a cape, you can just fucking swoop into. I have arrived. When you have a cape, you can speak this way. Like you're from England. And you can court a woman. You can use poetry. Poetry's dead, but if you have an English accent, a cape, poetry, and a falcon. Huh. Are you kidding me? A cape and a falcon? Even in 2011, you're going right to the top of the food chain. I don't give a shit. I don't care if the president of the United States walks through that door, I walk in with a cape and a falcon, forget it. "Oh my God, that's Barack Obama. That's so... What? Hold on, why is that guy wearing a cape and a falcon?" That's what every girl does. Every girl. Because I own everything, my lady. And you can court a woman with poetry when you have a cape, a falcon, English accent and poetry. Lady, my lady. Even the angels themselves fell back, dumbstruck, awed and clutching at their aching hearts, when God pulled you from his mold. I cannot look upon you. Your eyes, your eyes sparkle with a radiance that would darken even the sun. Caw-caw. I would grant you anything. You have but to ask. All I require is that you kiss me in this area. I know it's vulgar, but you see. You see how classy even a blowjob sounds when you've got a cape and a falcon? You get away with anything. Aw, man. I want it. I want it. You've got to-- it's got to be a falcon. Please don't scrimp on the bird. No, because Americans are idiots. Like, "A falcon. How much is that? Oh, no. Do you got any skinny chickens, I can paint his feathers brown?" That's what we do. We have sales. Can you dress up a crow? Put a hood on a crow? Is there any way? No! Got to be a falcon, all right? Ridiculous. Bird makes all the difference. It does. I'm sorry, birds are badass. And falcons, man, they can protect you. "Caw-caw" means attack face. They just fly up and... Like that. They do. They dive bomb your face. That's where I think the guy from Avatar got the idea. Like that. And they hit your... You can train them like that. You know, my buddy was a Green Beret, and he, uh, I told him that. I told him I was going to get a falcon that was going to attack somebody's face, and he goes, "That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life. Bring your falcon. Sic your falcon on me, bro. Please, do that for me. I want your falcon. I'll punch him in the beak, I'll pluck him, and I'll fuck him, okay?" Yeah, it's funny to you, but that's my dream bird. So, I was like, okay. So, we went to the supermarket because we were going to watch football, and we were getting all the stuff, and I picked up a chicken. Wasn't a big chicken. I picked up a chicken, and I go, "Matt," and I go... I tucked it under my chin, like this, and I go, "Matt, you're a Green Beret. Six foot four, 235 pounds. Thank you so much for your service to our country. I know you're a badass. You got no respect for a falcon." This is a chicken. Not a big chicken. A little chicken. There's a little chicken under my chin. "I want you to be honest with this question. We've known each other a long time. Be honest with this question, okay? I want you to tell me, honestly, keep your eye on this chicken. I want you to tell me, exactly how... that feels?" Yeah. I shot put it in his face, okay? He's like, "Aw!" I'm like, "That's it. Now dab the blood. You got tears in your eyes. I'm not done with the metaphor. Now do me a favor. Now, with that chicken, I want you, in your mind, to add razor sharp talons, a trailer hitch for a beak, and 70 more miles an hour! That'll leave a couple marks, Matt!" Diss my bird. That's why I believe in reincarnation. You could be reborn like a falcon, you know, which is awesome, and you know, people talk about it. You soar and attack faces and whatever. Or you could be a penguin, which is the most ridiculous. First of all, you ever try... Can you imagine a penguin on my forearm? You imagine what a dumb animal. Talk about ruining the whole look. You look like an Alaskan magician, or whatever. You know what I mean? Like, first of all, it's a dumb thing to talk about. You ever try to balance a penguin on your forearm? Anybody? Fucking... What's going on? You want to rake somebody's face, you got to pick him up and throw him at the guy. And even then, it's like getting hit by a long meat pillow with feet. Horseshit bird. Idiots. It's not even a bird. I mean... In the middle of the South Pole, you know how badly that would suck, just always cold. Like, this sucks. "Polar bear! Run!" Whatever. The point is, by the way, this is a little off topic. But I watch a lot of animal shows because I like the way they sort of teach us about male-female dynamics. There's a bird out there that can kick a grown man's ass. Yeah, very easily. You know what I'm talking about? Yes, the ostrich. The austrache, the African austrache. Very good class participation right there, okay? You jumped right on it. Now, a couple things about the austrache, that you may not know, okay? But I got to talk about it, okay? They run 55 miles an hour. Yeah, 5-5, and they can keep that pace up for a half an hour. You should all be like this... Okay? Don't act like you knew that, all right? Let me put that into context for you. A racehorse, top of the line racehorse, runs 45 miles an hour, okay? That means you take an austrache, you drop it in the middle of the Kentucky Derby, all right? Mr. Austrache is like, "Ha-ha. See you later, horsies!" It laps the fucking horses, man! You put your money on the bird. And it's got two legs. You didn't think about that until you came to my presentation. Not even why they're my favorite bird, over the falcone, okay? Here's what I love about them. When... They don't take crap from anybody. Not even lions. Lions come down to the watering hole, everybody else high tails it out of there because king of the beasts is in the house. You know what Mr. Austrache does? He draws an imaginary circle around himself, and he just hangs out. He just hangs out, minding his own business. Just hangs. Keeps a couple eyes on him, you know, just looks at the old yellow kit-kit-kitty-kitty-kit- kit-kitties! Kitty-kit-kit-kitty. Long as you mind your own business, kitty cat, but they never do. There's always some young, dumb male who's like, "You know, I want some... I want some bird." As soon as that... It's beautiful. As soon as that lion just dips, I mean, dips a paw over that imaginary circle, Mr. Austrache is like, "Here's the problem, kitty cat. I can run 15 miles an hour faster than you can, but I don't fucking feel like it. Hi-ya!" Takes one shot. By the way, it doesn't have to be a lion, either. Could be a Japanese tourist who didn't listen to the guide. Happens three times a year. I'm just telling you. (imitates Japanese) "Mr. Ostrich, smile! Smile, Mr. Ostrich! Smile!" "No!" I'm telling you. I want one roaming my property. The rich are buying them now. They're incredible. They're incredible watch birds. They keep everybody off your property. They only like you. Your property is their property. First of all, they can see over your wall. They're just doing this shit, all day long. "Any monkey business? Huh?" Yeah, and when maniacs and robbers come to your house, what animal are they looking for? Dogs, yeah. What are they not looking for? Yeah. They're not looking for a 350 pound, kung-fu turkey, are they? No, they're not. They don't teach you that in maniac school, do they? You're just like, "I'm going to kill somebody. No dogs. Is that a turkey? What is that?" "Wrong house!" Good boy, Nathan. You're a good boy. The only time a straight guy can lock his knees and his elbow at the same time. When he's petting his killer austrache. For kicking a maniac in the face. Good boy! You're getting chubby. This is my Christmas card. People get weird pets. They do. You know, ostrich is a good pet. Austrache is a good pet, dogs. Don't get chimps, we know that, right? No chimps. Bad pet. Bad pet. It's okay. Just, we didn't know until the 9-1-1 call. That's all. I had to listen to it. Shouldn't have listened to it. Had to listen to it. And I've never been the same since. There's before 9-1-1 call, and after 9-1-1 call. That's all. I listened to that thing like this. I mean... Like that. I mean that... Listen... Here's the thing I don't... Do a little research on your pets, that's all. Just do a little research. I don't understand how you think-- thought processes. Some people are so dumb. Like, do a little research, you know, they eat your face, your genitals and your hands. That's what they do. That's the first place they go. So, for me, I don't understand how you go, "Hi, do you have anything with six or seven times the upper body strength of a grown man with a three-year- old's brain? Anything like that? Are they prone to rage? Yeah? I'll take one." That's what scares me about life. You know, that's the unpredictable, man. For that woman, her tiger was a chimp. You know, that was the tiger in the tall grass. We're all going down. We're all going down. There's a tiger waiting as soon as you lock your knees, whatever. But she took her vitamins, she got her hair done, she wore her seat belt that day, she didn't expect... Like that, okay? There's no way to protect yourself against that, okay? They are so strong. They had a female in the Bronx Zoo, I think it was the Bronx Zoo. And it was 140 pounds, and they strapped it to a chair, and they gave it food, like, the more it pulled, the sweeter the fruit, okay? So it pulled, with one hand, uno mane, or is it mano? What do you say? Mano. God, I'm bilingual. So, you go, with one hand pulled 1,200 pounds. This thing was a 200-pound chimp. So I wonder, I wonder what you do. All that bench press you do, you could bench 600 pounds. You could have a 600-pound bench, and this what happens to you when Mr. Chimpanzee grabs you. Just... like that. That sucks! That's the worst way to die. I don't want to die by biting. I'll die by anything else, not biting. Thank you. I'll take fire, everything, not biting. Oh my God. No, thank you. That's why I don't swim in the ocean. I don't do that. Yeah. I'm not getting eaten by a shark. I don't care. I don't do it. No way. Uh-uh. I can go in these sneakers and the water would not go in my sneakers. That's how far. I'm not going in to my ankles because I might get sucked in by the undertow. I don't care. People want to make fun of me. My sister's like, "You're such a baby! It's very rare. It's rare. It's so rare. It's rare." "Yeah, okay. Where you're floating is rare, and if you see where I'm standing, that's never. Never. (applause) You live in rare land, I'll live in never land." So annoying. This is the thing as you grow old, you start to realize the things you heard as a kid, like, since I was a little kid, what do they tell you? If a shark attacks you, you punch it in the nose? You just hit it in the nose. Like that. Oh is that what I do? Oh, oh, I didn't know that. Oh, thanks. I feel safe. What are you talking about? They eat sea lions like this. Okay? It's like a Chevy with fins. What are you? Punch it in the nose? What the? You know how hard I punch under water? What are you talking about? My... I could take that in my... You could hit me in the balls like that, I'd be like this. And since when do sharks even... When do you see them to punch them in the nose? This is how you get attacked by a shark. Like that. You're swimming like, ah, the sun... (yells) That's just, I'm just telling you. Google it if you have to. They don't come out of the water like, "I'm coming!" Stupid. Dumb. I'm staying away from animals. I do not play with anything but a dog, or a kitty-cat. Sometimes you got to fight a man. I got in a fight. He was basically, he was basically, I mean, he was about the size of my kitchen. I don't know if you ever fought your kitchen. I'm not a tough guy, you know. You know, as a man, too, you know, I moved a girl out of the way. I just like, I went... It was crowded and I go, "Excuse me." Like that, and I guess it was the wrong girl because I just see... Like that. And, and he's this giant man. And you know, as a man, you always, like, you know, you learn how to punch, and you learn how to wrestle, you know. And you always talk a game, like yeah, I'd be ready. This is what I did when he came at me. I went like this: Yeah, that's not a good feeling, because when you have your kitchen... I don't know how to fight my kitchen. So, he came at me, but I'm crafty. I think. I'm crafty, I'll keep you busy. Okay, so here's what I did. It was amazing. And you try this. He came at me with his big bald head with these ears, and he came at me, and I don't know how I thought of it. I was like this, and I grabbed his ears. I just grabbed his ears. And he... they freak. Guys don't know what to do. He was like, "Get the fuck off my ears!" Like that. And I'm like, "I didn't do anything!" He's like, "I'll kill you!" And I'm like that, and I'm driving his face. I'm driving it. Like that. He's like, "I don't care." I'm like, "I didn't do." And I'm holding his face like that. And then he clamped on to my wrists with these banana hands. Like that. And I was like, "Oh God!" And I remembered the chimp. I remembered, so I just I just chimp-yanked him. I just chimp-yanked him. Like that, and I kissed that son of a bitch. I know. Not to brag, but I'm a really good kisser. And, uh, yeah. Plus, if he hits you then, it's a hate crime. But, um... So anyway, I was kissing him, like that, and it confuses the guy. If you do that, guy's like, "What the? I thought I was straight. You're... What the hell's going on?" Yeah, whatever they say. But the rule is, once he starts relaxing into your mouth, you you got to pull back, head butt, knee, all right? Yeah, that's the straight guy rule, because then that'll cancel out the hmm. You know? Here's the genius of that move. You make out with a guy, then beat his ass, fucks him up for life. Screws him up for life. All right? It's psychological warfare. Attack the mind and the lips. All right? But, I... You know, it's funny, because guys, if there are no girls around, guy wants to fight me, I'll run away. I don't care. I got no ego. I don't want to fight with you. Girl's around, I'm going down swinging. That's how it is with guys. We don't want to look like cowards in front of you. That's, guys, just, you know. They got to, that's why guys talk a lot. You know, guys, as long as there's six people between us. Yeah, I'll put you in the ICU, bro. You're lucky all these guys. Let me go, let me go. That's, we got to make a show. Like hitting our chests. And, you know, certain parts of the world, like New York. New York. There's nobody who talks more jive than Italian guys from New York. That's-That's an art. I don't care. Brooklyn guys. New York guys. Italian guys, nobody speaks like that. They got to tell you who they are, where they're from, what they're going to do to you, who they know. It's so beautiful, before the fight. They'll be like, "Bro, you want to fight me? You know who I am, bro? You want to fight? This guy wants to fight me. Getting his titties all twisted up, bro, do yourself a favor. Do yourself... go home, drink a warm glass of milk, take a nap, and go to Mass, all right? I'll slap you so hard, I'll kill your dog, all right? Bang. Your dog died. Like that." "Gonna kill my dog. Going to slap my dog. You going to slap me, bro? You going to put a hand on me? You know who I am? You're going to put your hand on me? You know who I am? You know how many people I know, bro? You put your hand, you look at me wrong, never mind slap me, you look at me wrong, bro, I make two phone calls, bro. Two phone calls. You go away in the morning. Tomorrow, your whole family is working in a circus, bro. Your dad's a clown. He's throwing pies in his own face. Your mother's a fat lady. You know that, right? You know she gets the job. No resume. She walks in, she gets the job. You know that. Right? How long's it take your sister to grow a beard? About two days? We throw her up on a stump, we charge two dollars to look at her, you hump." "You talk about my family? Now you talk about my fam... You bring my family into this shit, bro? Bro, two phone calls? You know who I am? You know how many people I... Two phone calls? You think you know people, bro? Listen to me right now. I make one phone call, bro. One phone call. I don't got to make a phone call. I text. I just text. You go away. Tomorrow, your house, your domicile's a car wash. Your mother's washing my car like this. Topless, her tits are slapping around. I don't tip her." (laughter) All right, that's just an example of the kind of stuff they talk in New York, and then they fight, all right? Here's the message, all right? Don't do any talking. Don't do any talking. You weaken your position, okay? You don't want to get into a fight in the first place. You got to spook the guy. Okay, it's like the African medicine man, same thing. You got to get him on his toes. You get your friend to do your talking for you because if somebody warns you about the guy you're about to fight-- very scary. Don't use a French guy. Certain guys you don't use, you know what I mean? No, because my buddy's French, and he got in a fight. It was the most ridiculous scene. (speaking in French) That's it. It just ends up making the guy horny. Yeah, you get dry-humped. But if you got... if you can get... if you got a creepy friend, the creepy friend's always the best. The guy who's just, you know... You know, everybody has that creepy friend? That one eerie guy, you never know what he does, he's always just hanging around, you know, he's usually carrying a shovel. You know that guy? Always digging in the middle of the night? You know, like, "Peter, what are you doing?" "I'm looking for my mother. Shut up." That's a good guy, because if you got the guy, the guy's standing there, he's about to fight you, you get Peter to walk behind him. Just walk behind him, like, "Um, excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm sorry. Please don't fight that guy. He's crazy. He's fucking crazy. He's totally crazy. He will take out your eyes. Like..." (groans) "Mommy." Okay, I'm making a point. Now, here's the lesson, all right? I got a way you can get out of this. If you do this, nobody would ever fight you, okay? I'm going to show you this. This is how you can get out of any fight in the world, okay? Guy's there, don't stand like this, okay? A lot of guys stand like this. If you know how to use this, that's fine, but usually I see guys standing like this, they get in a fight, they look like they're in a washing machine. You know what I mean? Start... It's embarrassing. So you want to confuse them, okay? So here's what you do, okay? I get in a fight, this is what I do. Boom, look at that right there. Yeah, I go hips out with the jazz hands, and look at how loose my mouth is. Yeah, it's not going to stop them, it just confuses them, though. He's like, "What the fuck? Is this guy a dancer? What's going on, you know?" He doesn't know. While he's confused in that interim, who do I get to do my talking for me? It's awesome. I get a Scottish nobleman to ride up behind me on a horse, all right? You know the one from Braveheart, with the fire-red braid and the kilt and stuff? Now, picture this. You're about to fight me, and I just hit this, okay? You're already confused, and Angus rides up on this crazy steed, and he just... he does one of... (neighs) Like that. And lands, and just looks at my opponent, and he goes... (with Scottish accent): "Excuse me, laddie. I hope it's not your intention to fight this man. For he's a good man. Aye. Some would even dare to call him a great man. But hear me now. And hear me well. If you are fool enough to go to war with him, then I hope you've got Satan himself by your side. Because you will need him! Hyah!" And he just rides off. You're not going to fight that guy. That guy's a great guy to have on retainer. Same guy gets you laid, too. Really. Just sits in the corner with a hood on, you're talking to a girl... then you gotta go to the bathroom. That's his cue. You're like, "I'll be right back, got to go... pee out of my dick," whatever you say. And-And that's when... that's when Angus gets off his stool, and he walks up, and he goes, "Excuse me, lass. I've come to warn you. That man you were talking to-- be careful. For to know him is to love him." Yeah, no woman's going to let that guy walk, no way. Every woman is like, "Excuse me, wait a minute. I don't know. Don't just say something like that. What the fuck does that even mean? Don't just say something loaded. To know him is to love him-- what does that even mean? Don't just say something loaded and walk away with that weird accent. What does that even mean?" "What I mean to say, lass, is that if you are fair enough to do the pornographic grapple with that man, than I hope you're prepared to crack the very clouds above you with your howls of ecstasy. You've been warned." And he doesn't... It's a bar, so he doesn't have a horse, so he does this, I guess. I don't fucking know. Well, we covered a lot of ground tonight, and, uh, that's the most important thing. We learned a lot. We learned about butter baths, and butterflies versus flies, and how to use your feathers, stool, my assistant, and, uh, a lot of people come up to me after the show, and they always say, you know, "Hey, Bry, um, thank you so much. I learned a lot. I didn't know you were that tall in person." Whatever they say, and, uh.... And, uh, and then they say, "You know you taught us how to fight, you know, one guy. What if you had to fight a group of people?" You know... 'Cause Scottish nobleman, African medicine man-- expensive! So, um, you know, but how do you fight a group? You always feel outnumbered in the world, you know? I look at the world, and I always wonder how people do it, but every time you want to fight for something that's, you know, worth fighting for, you're always outnumbered. I don't care if you're in the Middle East, if you're Egyptian, if you're Tunisian, whatever, and you stand there, and you're fighting tanks and planes. I don't care. A lot of times, you're fighting your kids, you're fighting your company. And you know, the good thing is is, like, A-holes-- a lot of times, um, cluster in groups. Like a Klan rally, or the Taliban. You know what I mean? You know? Or carolers, you know. Yeah. And yeah, and, uh, this ties into my number one horse fantasy. Actually... This is actually the ultimate horse fantasy I had. It wasn't just to save a sleepy town. This is the number one. I think this would be hilarious. Since I was a little kid, I've wanted to do this. You know, carolers-- they always stand in that, sort of, you know, line. They're like, "â™ª Deck the halls With balls of holly Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha... â™ª" It's just very embarrassing. You know, they knock on your door, you open up, and they're like... "â™ª Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah... " You know? And I just... (groans) You know? And, um.... (clears throat) And, uh, but, um, and then, there's always some cheesy crowd listening to them and kind of egging them on. Like, "Aw, that's a..." You know, and they're filling the air with their good cheer. And I think this would be awesome. I've always wanted to do this. I think this would be the greatest thing. I want to ride by. I think this would be the funniest thing. I want to get on a horse and just ride by, just top speed, just top speed, and while they're in the middle of the song, preferably when they're like, "â™ª Deck the halls With balls of holly Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha... â™ª" When they hit that part, I want to ride by, top speed, and just pull out a sword and chop their fucking heads off. I've always wanted to. All you got to do... It's so easy. You just ease your sword out, lock the elbow and the wrist, and let the horse do the work. It's a guilt-free kill, man. Not my fault your long caroling necks got in the way of my k-k-k-katana! Sparta, motherfucker! And you just ride off. (grunts) By the way, when I ride a horse, I slap my own ass. 'Cause I don't believe in cruelty to animals. Unless you're a face-biting cow. All right, well, I'm going to leave you guys with this. I just want to show you what I look like in slow motion... when I'm riding up on you on my horse, as death personified, and you're a caroler, okay? 'Cause let me explain something to you. You don't hear the thunder in my steed's hooves until it's too late. You're too busy listening to your varsity-choir voice. By the time you hear my horse, you're, like, "â™ª Deck the halls With balls of holly Ha-ha, ha... â™ª Is that a horse?" "Ha. Yeah, it is. Yes, it was. Uh-huh. Yeah." So this is what I look like when I'm riding up on you as a... as a, you know, as death personified, and you're a caroler, okay? So, um, we got that music ready? All right. I'm gonna get on. Go ahead, watch this. I'm going to get on my horse and tie my bandana. (dramatic music begins) (laughter) â™ª (laughter and applause) â™ª (rhythmic sword slashing) (music ends) (applause and cheering) My people. My people. Thank you! Thank you! Gracias. Merci! Arigato! (speaks foreign language) Thank you. Thanks to my parents, my wife. I love my wife. Thank you very much. (music playing) (applause and cheering) (applause, cheering & whistling) (cheering swells) (whistling)
