It's been hard, hasn't it? 13 and a half years. I'm so proud of you. Won-mo and I were playing marbles here that day, and I lost. Won-mo won the biggest marble. Then he ran off to go home. The investigating authorities confirmed the details with a woman who confessed to the crime. Lee Geum-ja was first introduced to the public as the criminal who abducted and killed Park Won-mo, a little boy. She was nineteen at the time. The whole world was shocked by her youth, her ruthless methods and by her unabashed naivety. My state of mind... This is where the alleged perpetrator had confined Park Won-mo. She claims she only wanted to stop his crying with a pillow. But what shocked us the most was her beauty. Clamouring tabloids compared her to Olivia Hussey. A tactless director announced plans for a Lee Geum-ja movie... creating a backlash from the press. That fall, the polka-dot dress became the hottest fashion trend. I saw you on TV. Behind that wicked witch's face of yours, I saw the presence of an angel. An angel. Could that be true? Do you really think an angel resides in me? If so, where was that angel when I was committing such an evil act? I always wondered about this after hearing what the preacher said. And then I realised that the angel inside me only reveals itself when I invoke it. Where are you? Please come out. I'm right here. This act of invoking an angel... This is what we call prayer. Actually, prison is an ideal place to learn to pray. Because... MISSING PARK WON-MO - AGE 6 we know that we are all sinners here. Thank you. TESTIMONIALS OF FAITH DAY FOR INMATES, 1997 It's tradition to eat tofu upon release so that you will live white as snow and never sin again. Go screw yourself. LEE GEUM-JA TIME SERVED: 1991-2004 KIM YANG-HEE TIME SERVED: 1998-2002 Meet your new cellmate. I'm Kim Yang-hee. I got five years. They said there was someone at Kyongju Women's Prison whose face would shine. You were a whore, weren't you? I heard her nickname was "the Witch." Come on in. You don't usually wear ties. It's mandatory here. We have a lot of VIPs visiting. Shit, it's too tight. Loosen it up a bit. He was my pimp. It felt so good when I was strangling him. I should've killed myself instead. Then die. And be born again. Over and over if you need to. Prayer is like a scrubbing towel. Scrubbing off all your sins. Then your skin will become as new as a baby's skin. All right? Geum-ja taught me how to repent of my past. It's a little bit noisy, being under the stairs, but this place brings good luck. Look at me. Three years of giving unlicensed haircuts to neighbourhood ladies, and now I have a real salon of my own. So set your hopes high. These are old, but at least you'll have something to wear. I wanted to get you better things. You do know that, don't you? Don't you have any high heels? You never really loved me, did you? You were just pretending. You've changed a lot. You used to be so sweet and talk so kindly. Are you starting the plan already? "No. The plan was already started 13 years ago," Geum-ja murmured to herself. Farewell. What is it you want from us? "Please forgive me. Please." She was going to beg Won-mo's parents until she had no fingers left. This is 802/9 Han Apartments... We've had a finger cut off here! Every penny Geum-ja earned from 13 years of labouring in prison had to go to pay for her finger operation. Then 6 days later... "Na Ru Sae Bakery" For now, just work till noon. Early mornings are hard for me with my low blood pressure. Geun-shik, say hello. I told you about Lee Geum-ja, right? Hello. I told you she was pretty. Can I call you "big sister"? Just call me Ms Geum-ja. Lee Geum-ja... When she first came, she cried non-stop, like a newborn baby. Man, it was so depressing. Damn bitch! It brings bad luck. Stop crying! A man once taught her that whenever she was having a hard time she should bend over and take five deep breaths. WOO SO-YOUNG TIME SERVED: 1990-1996 What are you looking at? You damn bitches! Down on the floor and keep your damn hands up! I felt like I was dying because I couldn't be with my love. Turned out I was suffering from chronic kidney failure. But it felt like I was dying anyway. Then this bitch suddenly says she'll give me one of her kidneys. It's not as if a kidney is a bit of pocket lint you give away so easily. Damn bitch. It brings me bad luck. Stop crying. Honey, Geum-ja's here. You've sure changed a lot. You heard my wife. Stay down! That's when I realised I'm married to a goddess. With this man by my side, I was never afraid. Right, honey? Yeah, but we couldn't go in together. They should have couples' prisons. But then that would be paradise, not jail. I don't know how to thank you. Honey! Geum-ja has this magnificent plan. You can help her, can't you? "The Dhammapada" Where did you get this? It's really old. Comrade Geum-ja, it's no use. Go save yourself. Okay, right after I finish cleaning this. Finish the chicken later. And be careful. Don't let the dogs have the chicken bones. Pass me that yellow book. KO SUN-SOOK TIME SERVED: 1967-1991 A spy from North Korea, Ko Sun-sook, had Alzheimer's and was a problem for the prison. So when Geum-ja volunteered to look after her, even the prison warden was relieved. People were trying to avoid stepping on me. And they whispered, "The spy, she's dead." But the pride in my heart wouldn't let me die. You said living is a struggle, too. A struggle not to die. I give this flower to you because you have an enemy... My goodness! You shouldn't be out so late! I asked for you at Na Ru Sae. Teacher! What were you thinking? I don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry dropping by. Fine. I'll see you tomorrow. How could you have changed so much? This isn't like you! Could we start over again? Come to church. Please? I've converted to Buddhism! - I bet you're here for adultery. - How did you know? It's all over your face, bitch! Please crawl over here. Please take them off. OH SU-HEE TIME SERVED: 1993-1994 Can you see it well? Say hello to each other. Hello. Hello? This damn bitch is that infamous Witch. She killed her husband and his mistress, then ate them. So I guess I'm not the unluckiest. I'll suck on her for five minutes and cry it off. I hate them skinny bitches. So go tell Geum-ja to start eating some more, okay? Your style has changed. What's with the blood-red eye shadow? I don't want to look kind-hearted. People order them from me, modelled on guys' photos. They're very popular. Shall I make you one? Can you make it in silver? - Did you find that bastard yet? - I did. - Did you kill him? - Not yet. - Why not? - I've been busy. Saving the best for last, is that it? This one. Excellent choice. Is it true the owner studied pastry-making in Japan? She's the one who made this. You've changed so much, I hardly recognised you. Who was she? Who was he? She's pretty. The detective that was in charge of my case. When I was exactly your age, that is, when I was nineteen and you were six, I kidnapped and killed a six-year-old boy. My goodness! Don't worry. I didn't eat him. How can we eat this? It was made by hands that have killed! I'm telling you I killed him. How many times do I have to tell you? Okay, then, tell me what that marble looked like. What? Just now you told me that you saw the marble but didn't know where it went. It was Won-mo's favourite marble. What colour was it? Light green. Come on! Why would anyone confess to a murder they didn't commit? Why don't you believe me? Is it because I'm a murderer? - Believe in Jesus. - Believe in Jesus. - Go to heaven. - Go to heaven. Begone, you devil! On top of that, I killed again in prison. Geum-ja wondered if Geun-shik might be stupid. I understand what you're saying, but it's against regulations to give out that information. There is a counselling service I can refer you to. Could you at least tell me whether she was adopted or not? Didn't you receive the notice? I was in prison, you see. I'd like to show you the 19-year-old Lee Geum-ja. A pretty girl who would turn any head, but who wasn't the least bit picky. This poor girl was on the verge of going mad. She tried to comfort herself with the thought that it happens to every woman sooner or later. Teacher? Mr. Baek? This is Geum-ja, Lee Geum-ja. I used to polish your shoes when you were a student teacher for my class last year. You didn't know it was me? You told me I was sexy, remember? Yes. You remember me, right? Pardon? Well, it's nothing much. You see, sir, I'm pregnant. Pregnant. No, pregnant. Yes, I am. Can I come live with you? Please? I can't go to my mum's. And it's even worse at my dad's. Him? He's just a big kid, not ready to be a father. "Don't worry, little baby. "Your mummy's right here," the poor girl murmured to herself. There's a drug called Timing. It suppresses sleep. When I first got back from Tokyo, I was managing a huge bakery. Whenever it was really busy, I took a Timing pill first. The other workers hated me for that. You have to be careful when riding a bike after taking it. Hello. Have you eaten? Geum-ja, what brings you here at this hour? I need an advance on my salary. No advances. I went to Kyongju, where my parents lived. I volunteered to teach at the women's prison there because my parents worried that I couldn't get married with my lame leg. But in my third year there, I was shocked almost to death after tasting a raspberry mousse cake that a kidnapper had made. The ingredients given to the inmates were miserable. But she'd used them to create a cake fit for a king. Three months' advance. Do you know you've changed? Eventually, I packed up and moved to Seoul because I was motivated to open up my own bakery. What are you doing? Writing my account number. I want to start a family early. And I hope to marry someone I can respect. So, you did something wrong. Then you make your penance and promise never to do it again. Isn't that right? That's just how life goes. It's just another experience gained. Isn't that right, Ms Geum-ja? I'm planning to kill another person. What? Do you think I'm sexy? Yes... No. Yes. I was hoping we could talk some more. Maybe later? You're trying to scare me, aren't you? You're trying to make me lose interest in you. Do you lose interest when a woman does this? No. Please go ahead. It was all right for me. How was it for you? Was it good? I've been told I'm so-so. No way. Mr. Baek said there are good kidnappings and bad kidnappings. What? He said it was a good kidnapping if the child is returned safely. And since they're rich, a little ransom wouldn't make much difference. And although they'd worry for a few days, the reunion would make the family closer. He said that, but then he went and killed Won-mo. The boy kept crying. Mr. Baek said he'd kill him if he didn't stop in five minutes. But then he really did kill him. If he were alive, he'd be your age now. But he's dead. Then the police found a witness. Someone saw me taking Won-mo to a bath-house. When I came back from the market one day, my daughter was gone. I got a call from Mr. Baek. He told me to confess and take the blame, otherwise my girl would die, too. So the kidnapper had kidnapped a kidnapper's kid. Isn't that funny? I thought it was. The house key is the middle one. Make sure these candles don't go out. Touch anything else and I'll put a hole in your head. Going somewhere? Hello. I'm Lee Geum-ja, from Korea. I had a baby thirteen years ago. I think it's your daughter now. I came here only to see her once and for all. I need to smoke. ♪ Once and for all ♪ ♪ I'm Lee Geum-ja ♪ - ♪ I'm Lee Geum... I had a baby... ♪ - Oh, I'm so jealous of you You had such a beautiful daughter. She is now our life! We love her very much. She's got such a beautiful soul. What would we do without our Jenny? What do you call 'mom' in Korea? What...is...'mom'...in...Korean? Ms Geum-ja. Can you take me to Seoul, Geum-ja? - No! - Yes... - Your mother, your father... no! - Why? Please... - No! - Come on. Why not? - No! - Yes - No! - Yes! - No. No! - Why? - No! - Yes! - No! - No, Come on - No! - Seoul, Korea! Geum... Geum-ja... Geum... ja Geum... Geum-ja... It'll sound like a cannon. With lots of smoke, too. The design's so primitive. What's the use of all this fanciness? Better to have a strong, solid shot. It has to be pretty. Everything should be pretty. It has a very short range, so get up close when you shoot. It's good if you can hear his heart beating, and it's even better if you see the sweat on his forehead. It's like playing golf. You get good shots with good form. Got a place to practise? Why'd you dump me? Tomorrow, let's go on a picnic. Why'd you dump me? Yeah, a picnic. I mean why? Why? Do you speak English? Damn... For a long time, Geum-ja had wanted to meet with Won-mo and ask for his forgiveness. If she found out that Won-mo had appeared to Jenny instead of her, she would have been very sad. Weekends with the family and the dog, too.

PARK YI-JEONG TIME SERVED: 1998-1999 Hey, you whore, you parasite, living off men's blood, I've got just the job for a slut like you. You know how itchy it is when you get bitten on the sole of your foot? What did I tell you? What did I say? It tickles when you scratch, and it itches when you don't scratch. It itches if you don't scratch, and tickles when you do. Right? You slut! It itches if you don't scratch and tickles when you do. I used to have a strong stomach. - I don't know what the problem is. - Here. Sorry. Nasty, huh? That's quite all right. I enjoy helping you. Thanks, Geum-ja. You really are kind-hearted. You understand that I only like plump girls, right? I'll eat a lot, too, and plump up for you. So, you just keep taking lots of food and medicine... And die quickly. - She fed her bleach? - Really? For how long? Three years. What a clean stomach she must've had. Geum-ja the Kind-Hearted. Well done! After that, Geum-ja inherited the "Witch" title, but was also still referred to as Geum-ja the Kind-Hearted. Everyone wanted to help Geum-ja the Kind-Hearted, and no one could refuse the Witch any favours. It has to be tonight. I can't take it anymore. Not even for you. Noh Soo-kyoung, a thief who was released before me, found out where Baek was working. Kim Seong-eun, a smart college grad, was released later and got a job at the same place. Then she told me that Baek was planning on getting a new car. Later, Baek was visited by a pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong. It'll be used wisely for the Lord's work. Hello? Darling. Have you had dinner? I'll wait and have it with you. You can go ahead without me. I'll wait for you, so hurry back. He hasn't eaten yet. I'll go and make him eat first. It's okay. Don't worry. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. Geum-ja. ...really wants to kill her. - Why is he killing her? - Wouldn't you do the same if it were you? Geum-ja held her breath and struggled to break free. Even in this desperate situation, she never forgot the gun's firing range. Where's the Korean-English dictionary? Don't think that I forgive you. I think mothers who dump their kids should go to jail. When I was younger, I often thought of taking revenge on you. But I couldn't imagine killing you, because I didn't know what you looked like. Anyway, since we're on better terms now, give me your reasons, at least. Apologising once is not enough. You should say sorry at least three times. Not generously, your daughter, Jenny. Left turn. I remember when I first had you, Jenny. As you grew in me, I felt good, like a wallet getting fatter. But even before your first birthday, I had to go to jail... And I had to give you up. You were such a sweet child that would smile at even complete strangers... I knew that any family would have to fall in love with you. Once I'm done with this man... I'm planning to return you to Australia. My sins are too big and deep... I don't deserve to have a sweet daughter like you. You're innocent, but you had to grow up without a mother... But, that's also part of the punishment I must take. Listen carefully... Everyone makes mistakes. But if you sin, you have to make atonement for it. Atonement, understand? Atonement. That's right, you have to make atonement. Big atonement for big sins... Small atonement for small sins. Understand? What are you going to do about him? Kill him? Why? Because he made a sinner out of me. What kind of bad things did you do? What is your sin? This man kidnapped and killed a little boy... And... I helped him. Do you want me to say sorry to his mother? Do you want me to go and apology his mother? You were happy with me, right? Will you? Were you happy with me? I was happy... Too happy for a sinner. Too happy for a sinner like me. Jenny... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm truly... I'm sorry. Farewell. Teacher! Get up! Time to go to work! Teacher! Get up! Time to go to work! Teacher! Geum-ja, what's with that eye shadow? Do you know why those kids... Hey! Here's another one! Hello? These children wouldn't have died if you'd found the real killer back then. Right? You know how this feels. There were four! I told you I can't come to work today. It's not that. Someone's here looking for you. Who? Well, the thing is... They won't say who they are? I don't know what they're saying. [IN JAPANESE] Well, can you speak Japanese? Mummy! Please hurry and come get me. Mummy. Mummy, please hurry. Mummy, I want to go home. Please hurry, Mummy. There, there. Don't cry. Don't cry... Mummy, where are you? I know it's difficult, but take a good look at this man. Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995. Dad, I can't... Daddy. This is Eun-joo in 1996. I can't breathe. I'm scared. Please... - Don't kill me, sir. - Wait just a minute. This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000. Baby... My baby... He was a teacher at English schools in affluent neighbourhoods. He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill them. Then move on to another school. He'd never pick a child from one of his own classes. - Coffee or green tea? - Which is why he was never under any suspicion. Children annoyed him. So he would tape them right after kidnapping, and killed them soon after. The voices of children you heard over the phone while you were negotiating with the criminal... It was played back from the video, after they were already dead. Now, you have two options. If you want lawful punishment, I will hand him over to Detective Choi here. But if you want a fast and more personalised death for him, you can have it right here. Right now. Does he have a child of his own? He is supposed to be sterile. Then why did he need all that money? He saved it. Of course, the money will be returned to you... With no kid, what did he need all that money for? He was going to buy a yacht. The police have big sticks, but they don't know how to use them. If we leave it to them, there'd be nothing but never-ending trials, and those bloody reporters... How about we leave it to Geum-ja? It'd be easier, since she's been to jail and all. That's being cowardly! They're our kids. Then let each person choose if they want to be in or not. I'm for individual choice. Why don't you just let him choose his own death or trial, then? Leave it up to him. First you wanted to hand him over to the police. Then you wanted to leave it up to Geum-ja. Now you want to be left out alone? What the hell do you want? Won-mo's family has to follow the majority, too. You know that, right? She has a weak heart. Hey, mine's weak, too. Then Won-mo's father can represent the family. One person per family should be enough. Is that okay? What if Won-mo's mother accuses us later? She wouldn't. Her husband is involved, too. They could always get divorced. We can leave some evidence, then. How about we all take a picture? So that even if we feel guilty later... Guilty? Guilty for killing that bastard? We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him when we had a chance. That's guilt! Let me say a word. I killed when I was in prison. I'm also the one who caught Baek after 13 years of planning. If anyone here informs the police... I won't say any more. Shall we go in one at a time? Or all together at once? One at a time for what? Let's just finish him off. There's no need to share such a personal matter with other families. Isn't that right, Dad? Won't it be scary going in alone? And it could be dangerous. Just think of it as using the toilet. In any case, it's a private affair. Let's do whatever each person wants. We don't all have to get the same set menu. Please, honey... We're divorced. This isn't a couples thing! We don't have to go in together. Excuse me. I think it would be too easy if we did it all together. - Honey! I brought along a sedative. You couldn't even touch Geum-ja's finger, remember? All right, then. Eun-joo's grandmother will go in alone, Se-hyun's will go in alone and Jae-kyung's and Dong-hwa's are going in together. Is that right? - Yes! Let's do it! Wait! Just a second! Shouldn't we decide what order you go in? Will that be enough for you? Do you want to use mine after I'm done? Well... I think I'll be okay. Honey. Everyone, pay attention. If you grip it like this, the tip of the knife will slip and not penetrate deeply. You could also cut your hand. So, grip it like this at all times, please. Or you could just stab him, like this. Why did you do it? You look like a normal person. Why? What for? Why? Ma'am, there's no such thing as a perfect person. This isn't going to bring our son back, is it, honey? Right? You all look very well-off. Take a look at Dong-hwa's mother. She took her boots off so that blood wouldn't get on the suede. Does that make any sense to you? My mum had to scrub hotel floors to send my brother to that school. We ran around like dogs to come up with the ransom. Now we've lost our house, and our relatives won't see us. My daughter-in-law killed herself, and my son left the country. We all have our own stories to tell. Dad! We're not the last, Dad. Eun-joo's grandma is still waiting for her turn. Dad. Come on, give me a hand! Mister, get up. Get a hold of yourself. Please. Get a hold of yourself! I'm sorry. But could you step aside a moment?
