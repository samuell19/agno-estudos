Sir. No one is boarding. Why do you keep stopping? The last bus doesn't just ferry people. Don't just ferry people, but ferry ghosts too? Sir, what game are you trying to play? Brothers and sisters. That ignorant girl is just shooting her mouth off. Please forgive her. Sir, stop the bus and let me out, quick! Sorry guys. I'm late! Are you all ready? If you are, let's head out. Wait, where's Charlyn? Charlyn says she's not joining us today. But that's okay. The three of us can go on, right? Just the three of us? I guess we better not then. Let's go when Charlyn is available. My grandma used to tell me. If you walk in threes at night, you will bump into ghosts easily. Especially for the person in the middle. Plus, it's the seventh lunar month now. What nonsense is that? There are no ghosts in this world. Actually, the real reason we are here today is to find out if this place is haunted. - What? - What? I thought you told us that we're here to review this new cycling park? That's not wrong. But the talk online is that accidents have been occurring frequently here ever since a new road opened nearby. And what does that have got to do with ghosts? Rumor has it that before its conversion into a road, the original site was a village cemetery. During World War II... Okay, please stop talking. I don't want to listen anymore. Okay, so this place may be haunted, but that has nothing to do with us, right? It has everything to do with us Haven't you realized just recently, other channels have grown more views and subscribers compared to us? It's about time we do something. Since everyone is so convinced that this area is haunted, so let's help everyone to investigate. Can you stop saying the word "ghost"? All right. I won't, okay? But let's just imagine, okay? If we managed to capture some "buddies" on video, our channel will go viral for sure, right? Should we give it a try? - Okay? - I still think we better not. I really think this isn't a good idea. Look how red the sky is. It will probably rain soon. Let's come again another time, okay? Yeah, I think this is a bad idea. There are no ghosts in this world and we'll look like monkeys. But we've already made the effort to come all the way here. Let's just give it a go. Okay? This might just be the breakthrough we need for our channel. Okay? Dee. Dee. I promise you nothing will go wrong. Alex. Okay? Let's go. You guys are indeed my besties. What's wrong? I can't seem to scan the code. Try this one instead. It's still not working. Did you get banned? No, it was fine just this morning. How about those ones? I don't have the app to unlock that one. Hey. Let's go, guys! Off we go! Wait for me! You look better. Hey, Alex! Okay. - Rolling. Press it. - Okay. Ready? Hi guys! Welcome to another new episode. I'm Nat. I'm Alex. Dee here. Unfortunately, Charlyn isn't joining us tonight. But that's okay. Tonight, we are doing something completely different. Right now, we are at the cycling park next to the newly opened FCE. And rumor has it that this place is haunted. Is that real? Let's find out! Cut! Nice. So, what's next? How are we going to capture the ghost? With this camera? I did my research online. If we use a digital device, everyone will accuse us of using Photoshop to manipulate the image. So, I've come prepared. I specially bought this with my own money for this project, okay? Come over. One, two, three! Alex, shush! What? Don't whistle. Why? It'll attract the "buddies". Nat, what are you doing? You said it yourself, whistling attracts the "buddies". Hey, stop doing it on purpose. All right, fine. Anybody wants to make contact? We are here to help! Hello! Nat, what exactly are you doing? I'm calling out to them. This way, they will show themselves. Then, we'll have content to shoot. Help me out. Dear brothers and sisters, - we're here to help! - Nat! Will you please stop it? What's wrong? Just listen to this, okay? I mean... Check this out, guys. We've been cycling for a while now, and... I mean, I'm pretty sure that the three of us are the only ones here cycling. Who could that be? It's just a bicycle bell and we're at the park. Come on. Alex, do you even see anybody... I think this is where the sound of the bell came from. - Dee - Yes? - Hold this for me. - Okay. It's just a bat. Didn't you see the silhouette? I didn't see anyone. But I saw something. I saw it too. See? Nothing. Hey! Wait! Stop it! What? Maybe the ghost that pushed over the bicycles is still here. There are no ghosts. Then, explain this. Why did the bicycles fall over? The wind? There was no wind just now. I don't know! An animal? Do you think that the bat just now could've pushed down all three bicycles at once? Where is Charlyn? What? Stop pretending. I know you're working with her to do all this, right? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? You're the crazy one. Call Charlyn now. Don't do that. She could already be sleeping. Just call. Okay. You're really calling. We're sorry. Your call can't be... I can't get through. Charlyn! Hey, Alex! Charlyn! Stop hiding! Hey! I'm not playing any tricks. Believe me! Charlyn, come out now! Are you freaking recording this? Someone just ran past! Charlyn! - Are you all right? - What happened? Something grabbed my leg. Enough! What's wrong with you? I've had enough of your stupid game! We're out. Guys, please believe me. I'm not doing this. I can't believe you would stoop this low. I swear. Charlyn is not here. Anyway, it's over. We're out! Nat, I believe you. But I really don't want to be here anymore. Let's leave together. Dee... Look, it's about to rain. Let's go. Dee, we shouldn't give up halfway... She's crazy! Let's go! Alex, can you just trust me on this? Dee. - Let's leave quickly. - Dee! Alex! Dee. Something is definitely not right. And I'm going to get to the bottom of it. Is your leg okay? Yes, it's feeling better. But don't you think it's freaky? The wheel just popped out suddenly. Nonsense! The screw must have gotten loose when it fell just now. Is it really okay for us to just leave the bicycle there? What do you want? Do you want to carry it back to the entrance? No. You've already put a note in the app. Okay. We left Nat on her own back there. Will she be all right? Then, what do you want? If you want to go and find her, you can go by yourself. No way! Hang on. Have we been going in circles? Yeah, I don't remember the entrance being so far. I think I saw a map there just now. Okay, let's go and see. Hi girls, I was telling the truth. There really are... See for yourselves. Please call me back, okay? Hello? Nat? Where are you? You need to believe me. I'm not making this up. We know. Charlyn gave us a call after she saw the video you sent. She really is at home. Alex and I encountered something strange, too. I'll head over once I'm done filming. Do you still want to film? Where are you now? Right now, I think I'm on that haunted road. Can you please stop? The photo you took just now is enough! Seriously, girl. I mean it. Stop filming... Hello? Hello? Alex? I'll head over as soon as I'm done, okay? Goodbye. She hung up. Josh. Didn't we agree that you would not come out on your own at night to ride the bus? It's dangerous. I told you the night before. If you do this again... Are you the father? Yes. Were you the caller? Yes. You call yourself a parent? Look at the time now. How could you let him run around to prank others? I'm sorry. I'll bring him home. Watch him closely! I will. Thank you. Josh, we are going home. That passenger was crazy. He told me to avoid the ERP. Min! Over here! Cheng, Mr. Huat, Ken. Have a seat. How is your business today? It's all right. This month is usually like that. Want a bite? I'll order for you. It's fine. I'm not hungry. Get something to drink at least. Strong black coffee? Ma'am, one glass of strong black coffee. Okay. Young man, don't be too engrossed with your phone. What are you looking at? It's just that everyone is sharing this video. Apparently, it captured the car that hit and killed someone along the FCE. You mean the social media influencer who went cycling? Not bad, Mr. Huat. You know about that as well. Aren't you updated? It was that Natalie, all right. Such a shame. So young and beautiful, but... I follow their channel too. What influencer? What video? Wasn't there a traffic accident on the FCE last week? Min, do you know about this? - Show us the video. - Yes. Here. That's it? I didn't see anything. Didn't you notice it? Look here. There, do you see it? One headlight is brighter than the other. There's nothing unusual about that. Women are sometimes bigger on one side too. Do you know what the traffic police found at the accident site? Broken shards from a headlight cover. I agree that this car is very likely the same one that killed Nat. Sorry, I need to make a move. Your coffee is not ready yet. You can have it. I need to rush off. Thank you. What's up with her? Must be you and your crass mouth. What has that got to do with me? Min! Yes? This is for you. What's that? A small token from all of us. I don't need it. Keep it. Medical bills are expensive. Thank you. What? Ma'am, stop the car. We're getting off here. What? No. Stop the car! I want to get off! The fare will be the same. Okay, hurry! What is wrong with you? Is this your first day? You can't tell left from right? Don't be a driver if you're not familiar with the road! I'm sorry. I'm just following the GPS route. We'll still arrive at your destination. But it's a longer route. If the GPS leads you into a river, would you drive into it? A machine is not alive, but you are a living person. How can you just rely on the GPS? What an idiot. Can you drive faster? My meeting is about to start! Sure. Hey, beauty. You're so pretty. Why did you choose to be a driver? It's just a temporary job. Is it? What did you do before this then? Ever thought of a career change? Hey, I'm the boss of a company. I could hire you. Is your husband okay with you doing this? I'm single. Really? Me too. How about we become friends? Stop it. We shouldn't have left her alone that night. We told her to come with us. But she chose to stay. We did what we could. What's been done is already done. Can you two stop arguing about it, all right? We're on the way to pay her our respects. Hello. Our friend Natalie, she... She died in a traffic accident recently. We are trying to find the perpetrator. If you don't mind, please take this. Could you put it up in your car? Thank you. Doctor Lim wants to talk to you. He's waiting outside. All right. Your father's condition is still quite unstable. The reports show that a blood clot caused the stroke. He might not be waking up from his comatose state any time soon. We can carry out another operation. But given his current condition, the risk factor is very high. For the time being, we can only monitor and maintain his condition. We'll make a decision if and when he gets better. But you have to be mentally prepared. Your father's condition can worsen at any time. Thank you, Doctor. I see. He ran away on his own again to take the bus last night? This would be the third time, right? Do buses hold a certain significance to him? Maybe it reminds him of his mother. Some time ago, because of work, I was overseas for a while. His mother took care of him. My wife, she... She would work until very late. So Josh would accompany her in the office. They would be there until midnight. And take the last bus home. She told me before that Josh really enjoys taking the bus. So even after I came back, the two of them would often take the bus together. Doctor. I feel like Josh blames me. Mr. Yong. What Josh is experiencing is called post-traumatic stress disorder. For children his age to lose a parent, the stress experienced would appear to be more severe. So far, is he still not talking at home? At school, as well. He doesn't speak to anyone. His teacher has informed me. If his behavior doesn't change, they might suspend him from school temporarily. That wouldn't necessarily be bad for him. Since Josh likes to draw, we could use art therapy to treat his condition, to counsel and comfort him. Doctor May? Can you come over? We've got a cab. Sushi? Wow! Hi, Mr. Yong. Sorry to disturb you. Could we come in and talk? Yes, please come in. Take a seat. Yeah, thanks. Here you go. Thank you. What can I do for you? How's everything, Mr. Yong? We're good. Where's your son? In his room. Mr. Yong, a few days back, someone released a video online, claiming they've captured the car that hit Ms. Natalie Tan. Are you aware of that? Do you remember seeing a car like this that night? No. Do you think your son saw anything? Is he able to talk? Just for a little. I don't think so. If he starts talking, I'll let you guys know, okay? Thanks, Mr. Yong. If that's the case, can you tell us again what happened that night? Yeah, sure. I went to the airport to pick up my wife and son. We were driving home. You guys know the rest, right? We'll make a move, Mr. Yong. Thank you. Take care, Mr. Yong. Thank you. Josh? Josh! Josh? What are you... It's not that I don't want to take the bus. But we're running late. You wouldn't want to keep grandma waiting, right? Right? What's wrong? I'm sorry. The car seems to have stalled. Excuse us. We are rushing for time. You can keep the full fare. What? Josh. I'm sorry, sir! Josh, we're getting off. He's too young to understand. When he's older, he'll see that it was an accident and not your fault. Don't be too hard on yourself. Look at you. You must've not slept well for days. You look exhausted. It's the seventh day of Jessica's mourning. Her spirit will return to tell Josh to stop putting the blame on you. The departed always return to visit their loved ones on the seventh day of their mourning. Jie. Come with me. Don't say that I'm superstitious. But I live here on my own. Besides Jessica, who else could have done this? And here, come and take a look. Look at this. What are these? Her footprints. My feet are so small. These have to be Jessica's. I believe that she will return to visit you and Josh. Josh. Don't be like this. You know my current situation. I'll see you when I'm back at the office. Rest early. Love you. Goodbye. Give it another try. Sure. It works. Thanks for the help. I'll make a move. You're welcome. Takagi! Hey! Give me a moment. Hi, Min. Hey. Your headlight is busted! Really? When did this happen? What were you doing? I have no idea. What now? I'll check if there are any spare parts. I had nothing to do with it. Hey! Min! What did you do? Takagi! There's a ghost! Blood! There's blood! What ghost? What blood? Look at the mess you made! How long will this take for me to clear up? Just go! Hello? Hello. Is this Ms. Tan Jia Min? I am. I'm calling from the hospital. Your father is in critical condition. Please come immediately. Why? Why don't you turn yourself in? Miss! Are you all right, miss? Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Wait for me! Josh! Josh! Is this really the right thing to do? I don't want anything to happen to dad. Mommy. Jie. Jie. What happened? I don't know! What the... Josh! Josh! Sir? Are you okay, sir? Sir? My son is outside. Open the door. Open the door! Josh! Josh! Hey! Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh! Who were you talking to on the bus? Was it mommy? Was that mommy talking to you? Listen to me. Don't listen to what mommy says. Mommy wants to take you away from me. Do you know that? Don't trust mommy. Don't listen to her! Do you hear me? Don't trust mommy! No! Can we talk now? Why did you suddenly take Josh to Hong Kong? You didn't even tell me. Do you know I was worried? Why did you go to Hong Kong? I know what's going on between you and Tracy. I don't know what you're talking about. Stop pretending. Dear. Don't call me dear! These photos are of you and Tracy having a tryst in Hong Kong. In a hotel. At the office. Even in the car. Such sensational images. Very action-packed. How did you get these photos? I... I want a divorce. The money in our joint account. I want it. The money from selling our house will all go to me. Also, I'll take full custody of Josh. I'll take him and my mother to Australia. This is exactly how you are. Have you ever considered how Josh and I would feel? Do you think this is fair? Fair? Did you consider how I would feel when you held Tracy in your arms? You were the one who refused to come overseas with me. And now you're blaming Tracy and me? Is it my fault that you slept with another woman? Will you stop being unreasonable? Watch out! Sorry. Dear. Don't call me dear! Is it my fault that you slept with another woman? I want a divorce. The money in our joint account. I want it. The money from selling our house will all go to me. I'll take full custody of Josh. I'll take Josh to Australia. I saw it with my own eyes! Josh. Josh. Wait! Josh! Ms. Tan, you're awake. I'll get the doctor. Please lie down. What do you want? I can help you. You shouldn't be getting up! Ms. Tan! Come back! Your father was in critical condition just now. At one point, his heart stopped. We have resuscitated him. But he's not out of danger yet. You may want to mentally prepare yourself. Dad. I hit and killed someone. What should I do? What should I do? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad! Josh! Josh! I think he's quite tired. You should take him home. Let's go home. Let's go home. Take care. So? Get the report done. Haven't got much though. Sir. This is for you. I'm the driver you are looking for. Sir, you can have this. What is it? The fried carrot cake I made. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Sir, don't mind me asking. Why must you stop at every stop? That's because this is the last bus. - The last bus? - Yes. Okay. Thank you.
