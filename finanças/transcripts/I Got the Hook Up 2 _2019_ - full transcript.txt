And as of yesterday at approximately 4:00 p.m., armed robbers stole $300,000 worth of Enfinity phones from the Westville docks. It is anticipated that they will take those phones from his store and move them to the streets. Jose Vargas, aka Kokaine, is Pablo's nephew. He runs the store, but he's more interested in his rap career than the business. So it shouldn't be hard to infiltrate his establishment.
