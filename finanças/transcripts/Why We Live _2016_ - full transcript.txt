Production: "WHY WE LIVE" Production Team 500 years ago Honganji Temple, Kyoto Monk-warriors! An attack from Mt. Hiei ! Master… Kotaro Satomi Katsuyuki Konishi Where's Rennyo! Find him! Ryoken, save Kyogyo Shinsho! Hideyuki Tanaka Ayumi Fujimura Takaaki Seki Yes, Master! Music by Toru Hasebe Catch him! Directed by Hideaki Oba Halt! Script by Kentetsu Takamori WHY WE LIVE: Master Rennyo and the Fire at Yoshizaki - Complete Version - Hey, you two! Bring it back! Ryoken, won't this bring bad luck? Nah ! Don't be superstitious! Know what that priest said when my pa died? "Can't make money off funerals for the poor." I hate priests! A dozen years later Enough! Hey, Ryoken! Cut it out! You're a… dirty fighter! Ha! A victory by any means is still a victory! The grace of Amida's great compassion I must repay, though I wear myself to bits. The grace of the teachers who led me… Welcome home! Chiyo, your singing's too loud. No temple songs, hear! Sorry. Sure is depressing with an invalid in the house. How can you say that to your mother… Shut up and make dinner! Ryoken, isn't your baby due any day now? Yep. I'll teach him sword fighting, make a real man of him! And what if it's a girl? It's a boy. I'll see he doesn't spend his life working in fields and caring for horses! Honganji The grace of Amida's great compassion I must repay… I'm back. Hello, dear. …though I wear myself… Quit singing that, will you! Oh… Believe you me, priests are all money-grubbers. When Pa died they said "Pay us a lot and we'll read a long sutra…" "Then he'll go to the Pure Land." Bah! But… They always want your money. The roof leaks or the gate collapsed… it's always something. Say no, and they'll threaten you: "Take your family grave home!" That's not true Buddhism. Listen to Master Rennyo! You'll see. Humph! So if I listened to that priest Ma would be cured? She'd be better off dead anyway, out of her misery. No… Anyway, stay away from the temple. Oh, but… I said don't go! All you need to think about is having a healthy baby! Working outside today? Better take these, in case it rains… I don't need 'em. Put your back in it! What, no raincoat? Wife's asleep on the job, eh. You'll catch cold. I don't care. If I know him, he'll stick it out from pride… I know! You okay? Can't get any work done this way. - What was that? - Lightning! Right nearby! Look, over there! Hey! Ryoken! Chiyo! Don't tell me… you were bringing those to me… Come on. Wake up. Chiyo. Chiyo, wake up! Chiyo! Working outside today? Better take these, in case it rains… I don't need 'em. It's my fault… With a baby coming, this should have been the happiest time of their lives. Human life is so fragile. Yeah, a person who's fine in the morning can be dead and gone by evening… Welcome back, son. How terrible. Chiyo, and the baby, too… I wish it had been you, Ma. Ryoken. Oh, Hana, it's you… First Chiyo and now your mother… I don't know what to say. How about going to hear Master Rennyo's lecture tomorrow? Listen to Master Rennyo… you'll see! I don't like priests… Don't you want to know what Chiyo wished for in life? 800 years ago, Shinran clarified the path whereby anyone at all can attain true happiness. That is Pure Land Shin Buddhism. 200 years later, Rennyo spread those teachings all around Japan. 200 years later, Rennyo spread those teachings all around Japan. When Ryoken first listened to Buddhism, Rennyo was 44 years old. So this is Rennyo. Different from the priests I've seen before… Everyone… Master Shinran's teaching consists of one thing only: The answer to the question "Why do we live?" Why live? Why are we born? Why do we live our lives? Why must we live on despite our suffering? Everybody wants to know this. Master Shinran gave the answer. "Amida's inconceivable Vow is a great ship" "that carries us across the sea that is difficult to cross." The passage I just read is from the beginning of his masterwork, Kyogyo Shinsho… Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment. "A great ship that carries us across the sea that is difficult to cross" What is "the sea that is difficult to cross" that Master Shinran spoke of? He is comparing life with its endless troubles to a rough sea with endless waves. Master Shinran taught that everyone is thrown at birth into this sea. Once tossed in the sea, we must swim as hard as we can. Swimming as hard as we can means trying as hard as we can to live. Then what should we swim toward? With nothing in sight but sea and sky, we have no sense of direction. And yet, everyone… we must swim or sink. We must swim for all we are worth. But suppose we swim and swim, not knowing where… what then? Eventually our strength will give out and we are sure to drown. Even knowing this, we can only keep on swimming. What's he saying? When we tire, we can't help grabbing onto anything nearby. We latch onto apiece of drift wood and catch our breath… only to be swamped by a wave, lose our grip, and choke on salt water "That driftwood was too small," we tell ourselves, and swim in search of a bigger log When we find a log, we grab hold in joyful relief only to be swamped by a yet bigger wave, and choke again on salt water "If only it had been a bigger log, this wouldn't have happened," we tell ourselves. And so our whole life is spent chasing a dream within a dream… a mid endless woe. Logs? Driftwood? Yes, everybody. We cannot live without something to rely on, something to give life meaning. Isn't that right? All of you have something that gives meaning to your life. For me it's the money I've earned. Couldn't live without it. For me it's my child. I have to raise him property Master Shinran taught that wife and child and property are in fact planks and logs floating in the sea. I think you all know these words that Master Shinran consistently taught. "All is idleness and foolishness, utterly devoid of truth." He was very clear on this. Wife and child… are logs? Why did Master Shinran say that family and wealth are logs and planks? I'll tell you why. Because parting is inevitable, whether in life or in death. No child, however lovingly brought up, does exactly as the parents hope. People suffer when the one they love dies suddenly from sickness or catastrophe. When the time comes for us to die, we must be torn from all we hold dear. We suffer, like a swimmer torn from all planks and logs, choking on salt water amidst the sea of troubles. But all you can do is hope for the be stand swim! Everyone. Even though we are certain to drown in the end, we think of nothing but how to swim. From the time we are born, we are bent on finding out how to live. If someone loses heart, we encourage them, "Do your best and live life!" But if you think about it, it's strange. If we are to die anyway, then why must we go on living despite our suffering? Is this not strange? Master Shinran gave the answer to this vital question we all have. He taught plainly that no matter how we suffer, we must go on living, because we have a most important purpose in life. Unless we know this crucial purpose, then living has no point. Isn't that so, everyone? She's no log in the sea! Abandoned by all… Torn from all I held dear… Dear, I'll wash the diapers! No, no, I need to help sometimes. Thank you. Oh, you came the other day. I apologize for my outburst. But I still don't really understand. Recently I lost my wife. I realized that she and the baby she carried were my reason for living. How can you call them "logs"? Well, it's like this. We all must die someday. You don't hear of anyone living thousands of years, do you? When you die, you cannot take your wife and child with you. You cannot take anything in this world with you. We each must travel the mountain path of death all alone. Master Shinran declared that there is a great ship that takes us across the sea of suffering and transports us to the Pure Land in good cheer. This is the ship made by Amida Buddha's Vow to lift us from the sea of troubles and bear us to the land of utmost bliss. And so Master Shinran calls it the Vow-ship of Great Compassion. But we, sadly, have neither eyes to see the Vow-ship of Great Compassion nor ears to hear the captain's voice as he calls and calls to us. Amida Buddha, knowing this, tells us he has made a big ship to take us on board as we are and deliver us without fail to his Pure Land. When by Amida's great compassion we are taken aboard the Vow-ship, in the same instant our life of suffering is completely transformed to a life of happiness. Painful as life maybe, we must live it out to be taken aboard this ship. This and this alone is the reason for listening to Buddhism. When do we get to go on the Vow-ship of Great Compassion? The answer is now, while we are alive. We are taken aboard this ship now and enter into absolute, unchanging happiness. Master Shinran calls this "heizei gojo"… completion of life's purpose now, in life. "Completion of life's purpose now, in life…" This is why we were born: for the completion of life's purpose now, in this life. Then how can we be taken aboard the Vow-ship of Great Compassion? Let me explain. Both Sakyamuni Buddha and Master Shinran taught that we can be taken aboard this ship only by listening to Amida's Vow. Why? Because Amida staked his very life on this vow: "I will take you aboard my greats hip in the instant of hearing" That's why listening intently and carefully to Amida's Vow is so crucial. Huh? Can we really board the ship just by listening? Can I be taken aboard too? Ah. You may well think "Can someone like me really be taken aboard?" Yes, that's it. Look over there. See the hole raindrops made in that stone? Water is soft, but if drops hit the same place again and again, they can drill a hole in stone. Cast aside all your various deliberations, turn only to Amida Buddha, and listen single-mindedly. In the very moment of hearing, Amida Buddha will take you aboard his greats hip as you are. Master Shinran wrote the "Song of Praise for Amida's Grace" to express his great debt. The grace of compassion that I must repay "though I wear myself to bits" refers to the grace of Amida, who alone saved me when all the other Buddhas of the universe had given up on me. Think of the profound gratitude you would feel to a doctor who cured you completely after every other doctor had abandoned hope of your recovery. The difference is that Amida's salvation goes far beyond a physical cure. It saves your eternal soul. Gratitude for such grace can have no end. "The grace of the teachers" that I must repay though I work myself to the bone refers to the profound debt of gratitude we owe to those who taught us of Amida's existence. In the previous example, those would be the ones who introduced you to the world's single most brilliant physician. That's all for today. Song of Praise for Amida's Grace The grace of Amida's great compassion I must repay, though I wear myself to bits. The grace of the teachers who led me I must repay, though I work myself to the bone. The grace of Amida's great compassion… The grace of Amida's great compassion I must repay, though I wear myself to bits… Hey, what's that song? Mm? Ah! Chiyo was trying to tell me about Amida's great ship! So that was it, Chiyo! After encountering true Buddhism, Ryoken began listening regularly. He discovered great joy in listening deeply to the teachings. And so he became Rennyo's disciple and took the name Honko-bo Ryoken. More and more youths found true Buddhism and dedicated their lives to sharing it. Around this same time, a man named Doshu came from the mountains of Gokayama tortured by the crucial question, "Why do I live?" I'm sorry. The Main Hall is full, so please come this way. Everyone, please walk slowly without pushing. As Rennyo's talks drew more listeners, the Main Hall was enlarged many times. Hokyo-bo, I want as many people as possible to listen to the teachings. Yes, Master. But you know, we enlarged the hall just last year. I'm afraid there's no more room. We've reached the limit, have we… The long Onin War would soon give way to the period of War ring States. In those dark times, the teachings of Shinran explaining "why we live" were especially radiant. Seekers of true salvation increased daily. Besides his ardent teaching, Rennyo found time to write to his followers. He explained the true meaning of Shinran's masterwork written to save humanity. Kyogyo Shinsho (Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment) Rennyo's clear commentaries are known today as "The Letters". They played a great role in spreading Shinran's teachings far and wide. "The painful sea of birth and death knows no bounds;" "long have we been sinking in its waters." "Only the ship of Amida's Vow will take us aboard and carry us across without fail." Master Shinran explained very plainly. "The painful sea of birth and death knows no bounds,." "long have we been sinking in its waters." This refers to us, who have drifted long in the sea of suffering. "Only the ship of Amida's Vow will take us aboard and carry us across without fail." This means that only Amida's Vow-ship of Great Compassion will lift us and take us to the land of utmost bliss. This is why before leaving this world Sakyamuni Buddha said: "Turn toward Amida Buddha alone. Believe only in Amida." "Believe only in Amida." Ha! He said you can't be saved by other Buddhas or deities. I heard they take our sacred objects and burn them to heat their bathwater! They're heretics. Beyond the pale. - I'm glad I came, aren't you? - Oh yes! Why are so many attracted to such a devil? There goes the town's leading merchant and his main clerk! They left us and went to Rennyo. Damn it! He stole our members! At this rate, our temples will attract still fewer followers. We can't let this pass. We'll show them what we're made of! The rapid growth of Pure Land Shin Buddhism was a threat to other sects. They saw Rennyo as a devil luring the masses to Hell In those days, at the temples on Mt. Hiei, there were bands of armed monk-warriors that carried lances and swords and spread fear Then a terrible incident took place. 1465 (Kansho 6) On the 10th day of the first month of 1465, monk-warriors of Mt. Hiei attacked Honganji This is known as the "Kansho era persecution." Rennyo was then 51. Oh no! Monk-warriors from Mt. Hiei are on the attack! Master Rennyo! Hokyo-bo! Protect the object of reverence! Yes, Master! Ryoken, you carry out Kyogyo Shinsho. Yes, Master! I will protect it with my life! Break it all down! Where's Rennyo! Find Rennyo! Catch him! Halt! Ryoken. Let's go. The Honganji temple was utterly destroyed. But people's desire to hear Rennyo speak did not fade in the least,. It burned brighter than ever Rennyo responded to their wishes and taught Buddhism, braving any danger The monk-warriors! They're back! Wherever he went, his listeners increased, and monk-warriors went berserk. Often he had to hide beneath bridges Orin caves. Though chased from place to place, Rennyo never gave up. WANTED - DEAD OR ALIVE: RENNYO Says they'll pay in gold for Rennyo's head. With that kind of money you could live like a king! In time, even mercenaries went after Rennyo's life. Master, are you all right? I'm fine. This is nothing. Please be careful, Master. Once across this mountain, they won't come after us. Doshu. You know these mountain roads like the palm of your hand. All I have to offer is strength. Ryoken, you and your wooden sword are invincible! It's six years now since Honganji Temple was destroyed. What suffering you have endured, Master! No. All that counts is quickly conveying Master Shinran's teachings to everyone! You're Rennyo! Who are you! Step aside! It's Rennyo we want! How dare you! I won't let you lay a finger on the master! Who do you think you are! Why, you… Fight on, and I won't show mercy! Just you wait! Master! I am so glad you are safe! Hokyo-bo, are you hurt? I'm fine. It's just as Master Shinran said: the world is degenerate. Rife with slander and persecution. It's unbearable to see you undergo such hardship… Hokyo-bo. Back when Master Shinran was exiled, remember? He rejoiced that Amida Buddha had enabled him to share Buddhism among the people of Echigo. When I think of all he endured, my sufferings are as nothing. Master! Everyone, I'd like to visit the Hokuriku district, which has strong bonds with Buddhism. What! Up north? Yes. Once I visited there following Master Shinran's footsteps. Everywhere I went, people were eagerly waiting for the true teaching. If we can't preach in the capital, let's go somewhere else where people want to hear. The world is full of people hungry for Master Shinran's teachings. That's true! Doshu. Weren't you born in Hokuriku? Yes, I'm from the village of Akao, in Gokayama. A place of heavy snow… Yes, it piles up twice my height. But if you go there, Master, we'll clear a road for you! Gokayama is that snowbound, is it? However deep the snow, if it comes to that, I'll carry you! All right now. Don't treat me like an old man. Let's be off! Yes! And so at age 57, Rennyo set off for Hokuriku. Yoshizaki is on the border of Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures. Yoshizaki (Fukui Prefecture) It is a peninsula jutting into a lake. The men climbed a hill and the view opened up before them. This is great! Yes, Master, here we could build as big a Main Hall as we wanted. Big enough for everyone! In the distance is the wide blue sea. What a beautiful spot! It's as if a great temple is rising from the lake. An environment where visitors can listen to Buddhism with quiet and focused minds is most important. Everywhere we've been, as listeners increased the monk-warriors would rampage. With water on three sides, they won't bother us here. If we fortify the remaining side, it will be impregnable. Everyone can listen in ease as Master Rennyo tells of Amida's Vow. Building the Yoshizaki complex required vast funding and goods. But thanks to contributions from eager followers around the country, The Yoshizaki complex It was finished in no time. On hearing that a great temple had been erected in Yoshizaki, Shinran followers who revered Rennyo rejoiced, all across Japan. Day by day, people flocked to Yoshizaki wanting to hear Rennyo speak. Ryoken, long time no see! Doshu! You brought people from Etchu? Yes. Everyone is thrilled at the prospect of hearing the master's sermon. Those people must have come for the lecture, too. Let's go greet them. Welcome, everyone! Where are you from? We came from Dewa. Dewa! That's very far. You must be exhausted. Please rest yourselves. Ryoken, Doshu, and the other disciples went to great pains to make visitors comfortable so they could listen carefully to Rennyo's sermons. Master! Hard at work, I see. Yes! May I have a taste? Yes, Master! Delicious! Our visitors from afar will be worn out. Perhaps a little more salt? Yes, Master! Continue cooking with care. Certainly! Special lodges called "taya" were built for visitors from afar They were named after Hokyo-bo, Kuzen-bo, Honko-bo, and others. The disciples looked after visitors and talked with them about Buddhism. Honko-bo At night, a dozen people of all ages gathered with Ryoken in his lodge. He went over what Rennyo had taught to see how they each understood the sermon. Tell me… are Amida Buddha and Sakyamuni Buddha one and the same? No, completely different! Really? I always thought they were the same. Master Rennyo made it clear today, remember? There are countless Buddhas in the universe, like Dainichi Buddha or Yakushi Buddha. Amida Buddha is their master. Then Sakyamuni Buddha is a disciple of Amida Buddha? That's right. I can't see Amida, so I just can't feel gratitude to him. That's understandable. But once taken aboard his Vow-ship, everyone will be made clearly aware. If you listen carefully to Master Rennyo, you'll understand… Just as any child, however ungrateful, comes to appreciate his parents, the infinite grace of Amida Buddha will become clear, as in the song. But Honko-bo, surely you were never an ungrateful child? I am, I am… the worst, the most ungrateful child there ever was. And yet, extremely evil as I am, Amida Buddha has taken me aboard the Vow-ship unconditionally! Humph! So if I listened to that priest Ma would be cured? She'd be better off dead anyway, out of her misery. Only when I was taken aboard the Vow-ship did I see how much I owed my mother. But it was too late. She was no longer alive… But it's because she gave birth to me and raised me that the Vow-ship took me aboard and I could know of Amida's vast grace. When you're saved by Amida, is it really that clear? I wanted to ask that, too. A very important point. When Master Shinran was saved by Amida and attained absolute happiness, he said: "Ah, Amida's Vow is real, it's true!" How genuine, the Vow of Amida Buddha! How genuine, Amida's promise! "How genuine, Amida's promise!" Why do you suppose Master Shinran said this? We have been sinking in the dark sea from ages past. Knowing this, Amida promised to take us aboard his great ship in an instant, and carry us to the Pure Land without fail But we doubt this vow of Amida's and suffer without ever boarding his ship. The instant that doubt is dispelled, great joy arises. "How genuine, the Vow of Amida!" expresses that joy. That is what Master Shinran meant by the words, "How genuine, the Vow of Amida!" He could not help crying out in joy: "It is real, it is true!" "Song of Praise for Amida's Grace" is Master Shinran's song of gratitude to Amida. Until you are taken aboard the Vow-ship of Great Compassion make sure you listen intently and carefully to Master Rennyo's sermons. Namu Amida Butsu People came to Yoshizaki from nearby Hokuriku, Kinki, and Tokai, as well as far-off Kanto and Tohoku, to join the flourishing complex. The lonely fishing village was quickly transformed into a great Buddhist city. This shows the wondrous power of Buddhism. But once again, other sects were filled with jealousy. Since Rennyo came to Yoshizaki, our following has shrunk. Our alms and prayer fees are drying up. The monk-warriors in Kyoto went after him, but he hasn't learned his lesson. Are we going to sit by and do nothing? No! We have to act! But Yoshizaki is a natural fortress, surrounded by a lake. There is a way. Tell us. Come closer… The 28th day of the third month, 1474. At Yoshizaki a strong wind blew, a harbinger of spring Rennyo was now 60. That evening, a suspicious fire broke out by the South Gate. Fanned by the wind, flames spread quickly and destroyed nine lodges. Soon the Main Hall was threatened by a raging fire. Rennyo was reading the "Enlightenment" chapter of Kyogyo Shinsho, written in Shinran's own hand. Oh no! Fire! Fire! It's heading for the Main Hall! Save the object of reverence! Get it out! Master! Master! There is a fire. A great fire! Hurry! Hurry! You must escape! A fire, you say? Yes, Master! Fire broke out by the South Gate and is spreading to the Main Hall! Quickly! Save the object of reverence and Kyogyo Shinsho! Yes, Master! Go do it. Yes! It's not safe here, Master. Come with me! Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment "Enlightenment" Chapter Master! - Master Rennyo! - The master… You're safe! Thank goodness. Master! The object of reverence and Kyogyo Shinsho are both safe. Thank you. But how awful… After all the members' work that went into building this complex… I feel terrible. Don't say that, Master. Whatever else we may lose, as long as you are safe… That's right! Oh no! What is it? Master! What's wrong? Master! Let go of me. I've made a terrible blunder. I can't let you go, Master. Calm yourself. No, Hokyo-bo. I left the "Enlightenment" chapter on my desk! The flames are too strong. You can't go back. Let me go! How could I do this to Master Shinran! Let me go! Allow me, Master. I, Ryoken, swear to you… I'll protect the "Enlightenment" chapter with my life! Ryoken… Honko-bo! Ryoken! Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment "Enlightenment" Chapter Ah, how wonderful! Amida Buddha protected it! I must keep my vow to the master, protect Kyogyo Shinsho at any cost! But how?… Blood! That's it! Instead of water I can protect it with my blood! Master Rennyo… Knowing you was the greatest honor of my life! I've been truly fortunate! All life ends. I could wish for nothing more than to give my life for Buddhism. I'll meet you in the Pure Land. Namu Amida Butsu This is great! Honko-bo! Ryoken! As day dawned, the fire finally subsided. How dreadful! To have lost the "Enlightenment" chapter in the master's hand, and Ryoken too… Master. Even if the worst has happened to Ryoken, it was his own choice. He would surely have no regrets. Hey! Anything yet? Honko-bo! Ryoken! Honko-bo! Anything? Here he is! It's Ryoken! Oh, Ryoken, my error led to this… I'm sorry. Forgive me! Master! He… he… What! M-master! Look… inside him! Oh, Honko-bo. How brave of you! Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment "Enlightenment" Chapter You did what I, Rennyo, ought to have done. You are the true Buddhist. You willingly sacrificed your life for truth… a model for all Shinran followers, a beacon for humanity for all time! And so the Yoshizaki complex burned down. But the scripture Ryoken saved by inserting it into his body… Shinran's answer to the question "Why live?"… survives to this day. Teaching, Practice, Faith, Enlightenment "Enlightenment" Chapter It is known as "The Blood-stained Scripture." Many more young followers of Shinran gathered around Rennyo. Like Ryoken, they learned true Buddhism, gained absolute happiness, and worked for the eternal salvation of all humanity.
