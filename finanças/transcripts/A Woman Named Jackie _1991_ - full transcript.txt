[airy orchestral music] [siren sounding] - I'm a mess. What did the doctor say? How far along is she? - Honey, you're driving me crazy. - I'm so nervous. I wasn't even this nervous with my own children. - Wanna go out for a walk around the block? - No, they might need us. - What for? To boil water and get some clean towels? Come on, we've been here all night. Let's get some air. - I need to be here. I've been here so many times before. - Where? - In hospitals. Waiting. Praying for someone I love. - Jacqueline is her name. Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. [baby crying] And a great beauty she is too. - I don't think I've ever been so happy. We're gonna love her more than any child in the whole world. - She'll have anything she ever wants. I'll see to that. Ooh. - I only hope she sits a horse well. - She'll do everything well. Look at her, she's a winner. A Bouvier and a winner. - We've gone over this a thousand times, Bouvier. - These are hard times, sir. The crash, the depression. People are just not contemplating the purchase of stocks anymore. - You have no one else to blame but yourself. You're drinking. You're gambling on risk. - Daddy I'm gonna see the children. I hope that you and Jack can have a nice quiet chat. - What are you doing here? Jacqueline, where's Nanny? I don't want you listening to this. Put Woofty down. - In any case, sir, I find myself at the mercy of your generosity. For your daughter's sake and the children I ask you for this loan. - You know my conditions. - I do indeed, sir. - What's the matter? - Listen to what our grandpa's doing to our daddy. - Yes, sir. Retreat, retrench, remorse. - No cavorting. No drinking. No women! - I do love your daughter, sir and our children. As for the loan, you did say interest free, am I correct? [horse hooves clacking and birds chirping] - Ladies and gentlemen, the next event is the new rider trials. Riders be ready in center ring. - Congratulations, mommy, you were wonderful. - Thank you darling, now it's your turn. - I'll leave them in the dust. - That's my girl. [horse neighing] - She's got perfect form, did you see that? - I'm glad it's you and not me. - Keep a lookout for daddy. [crowd chattering] - You need any help, Jackie? - No thanks. Jacqueline. Bouvier. [hooves clacking] - Hello. [applauding] Sorry I'm late. Hello, Pete. Look who I brought along. - Lorraine, what a nice surprise. - We ran into each other at the train station. Jack insisted that I couldn't miss you. - Good, need all the help we can get. - She looks like she's doing fine. - Really, what about those heels? - Everybody can't be perfect. - Some of us can damn well try. [hooves clacking] - Rider seven, heels are up. - Deduct a little. - Yup. [crowd chattering] [crowd applauding] - Ladies and gentlemen, the blue ribbon goes to number four. Miss Shelby on Barrow. [crowd applauding] The yellow ribbon goes to number seven, Miss Bouvier on [drowned out by applause] - Great job, Jack. - I wish you would stop calling her that. It's as bad as Jackie. - Third place, great. - Who was in control out there? Not you. - I know, I'm sorry. - Excuse me, Miss Bouvier? We're taking photos of the winners. Would you mind? - Of course. - May I have your attention please. The next event is grand prix. - How's this? - That's good, hold it. - Eh, what a bore. Nobody said anything juicy. And I hate the smell of horses. Oh my god, that's Blackjack Bouvier. That old goat and Lorraine Murray. Get that shot, get the shot. - Thank you Mrs. Bouvier. - My pleasure. - What do you say we all have a drink? - Yes, let's, such a beautiful day. Life is so full. - You are young. - Interesting item in the daily news. Looks like the Bouviers and Miss Murray are having a grand old time. Behind the dumb little wife's back. - Don't be silly, I'm as fond of Buffy as you are. - You bastard. - For heaven's sakes Jen, we're just friends. I had no idea we were gonna be in this picture. Who sent you this? - A good friend who wanted me to know what everybody else already knows about Jack. Of course I've known all along. You can't keep your trousers buttoned. - The difference between you and I, my dear is that you're so terrified of not fitting in you've forgotten how to live. - Oh I know how to live a decent proper life. - You can't take a breath without referring to an etiquette book. - You should try it sometime, Jack. - I don't give a tinker's damn what people say. - Of course you don't. Because you're a selfish drunk! - My drinking was never a problem when the Bouvier name got you in the social ranks. - That's not why I married you. - That's all you ever wanted from me. - That's not true. I want a husband, a family. - A family. All you wanna do is claw your way to the top of society because your father came from nowhere. - At least his father made his own money. - And mine didn't? - He doesn't tell lies about our family history like your father. Shamelessly making up a story that you extended from French Aristocracy. - The Bouviers did descend from French Aristocracy. - The Bouviers were nothing but a bunch of filthy cow farmers! - For better or for worse, we are what we are. - I can't accept that. - The question then is, how do you choose to live your life? - Exactly. - Elevated, like I do? Or by the book like you do? - I choose to make a respectable life for my daughters. And if necessary, I'll do it by myself. [bird squawking] - Good morning Jacqueline. Jack. - Sir. - Jacks, I have to speak-- - Not now, Daddy. I'm late, let's go James. - Now. [door slamming] I have something very important to talk to you about. - What? - It looks like your mother and I are going to get divorced. - No. - It's not the end of the world. - Not for you. - Not for you either. - It's too horrible. - Jacks, look at me. - I can't. - Jacks. My pet, you're like a beautiful thoroughbred. Strong, you have brains, and you can run like the wind. What is it that makes a racehorse great? - Heart? - Exactly, heart, determination, staying power. Trust yourself, Jacks. Trust in your bloodlines, in your training. The Bouviers have great heart. And you are one of us. And remember. We never allow anyone to know our feelings. Come on, I'll drive you to the stable. - Will you stay and watch me ride, Daddy? - Of course I'll stay and watch you ride. [mild music] [honking] - I'll race in that. - Oh how cute. I want that one. I want that one, that one and that one, that one. And that one. - Would you ladies excuse me please? [giggling and chattering] [cat mewing] - Hello. - Have them back by five. Got them? Come on. [dog barking] Having fun, my pets? - Mhmm, great, daddy. - Catch me up on all the news from home. - Well, I'm taking ballet and reading a lot. And mommy's getting married. - Really? To whom? - Uncle Hewdy. - Hugh Auchincloss. We brokers have a saying, take a loss with Auchincloss. [laughing] - Don't laugh, daddy. He's very nice and he's very rich. - He's penurious and cheap. And he has no sense of humor. - Mommy likes him. - I'm sure they'll be very happy together. - And do you, Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Junior take Janet Lee Bouvier to have and to hold for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, till death do you part? - I do. - And do you, Janet Lee Bouvier take Hugh Dudley Occenclass Junior to have and to hold, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, till death do you part? - I do. - By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Virginia, I now pronounce you man and wife. - Awful. - Yes, isn't it? Quite. I assumed your mother's gonna fix it up. You remember me? - Yes, you're Hewdy's son, Yusha. - That's right. Now that my hall has married your mother, I guess we're related. - You're my stepbrother. - Yes, something like that. - Who's your mother? - I beg your pardon? I say my mother's wife number one, Maria. A Russian type, hence Yusha. And your father? - Husband number one, Jack. Hence Jacqueline. - What a wonderful world it is. Have you seen our Newport cottage? - I've heard about it. - It's bigger than this barn and even less comfortable. And they've cut the staff to the bone since the war, so. - I won't be around much. I start Farmington this fall. - Oh you mean Miss Porter's? - Those who call it Miss Porter's don't go to Miss Porter's. That sounds snobbish. - Well as a Yale man I'd have to say yes it does. - It's strange. - What is? - Watching one's parents get married. - I've gotten quite used to it. - I'll never get used to anything parents do. That's why I can't wait to go to Farmington. [people chattering] - Mighty bones, Jackie. - Thank you. - Shame, shame. Meet us at the lake after curfew. We're gonna have a party with all the goodies from visiting. - No thanks. - She'd rather be reading poetry. - Hey Jack! - Excuse me, there's my father. - Don't go, let us at least say hello. - Good afternoon, ladies. - [Girls] Hi, Mr. Bouvier. - Ready for that steak? - I've been dreaming about it for weeks. - Bye girls. - [Girls] Bye bye. - Your cartoons in the student newspaper are fabulous. - What are you doing with that old rag? - I have a subscription. So tell me how you're getting along with your stepfather. - He's kind of strange. We have to stand at attention at family meals and recite the family motto. Obedience to the unenforcable. [laughing] - What the hell does that mean? - Nobody seems to know. - And what are you doing for boys? - Nothing really. - Ever have a date? - Daddy! Well sometimes Yusha brings some friends down from Yale. - Hmm? - And we have tea. - Hmm? - And we go somewhere for dinner. - Hmm? - Hmm? I've been thinking what to do when I graduate. Maybe a photographer's model? Do you think I have a chance? - Who took this? - Girlfriend, classmate. [ripping] - No, absolutely not. - Daddy! - Waiter! - Yes sir? - Bring me another drink. - Right away. - Do you have any idea what this picture makes you look like? It makes you look available. You are not available. [laughing] [doors slamming] - Ah, what a day. All a woman really has is her reputation, Jacks. I know from experience, don't be fooled. Most men only want one thing. Good evening ladies. - Good evening sir. - Daddy, I can go the rest of the way by myself, really. - Mystery is a woman's cache. Nothing wrong with playing hard to get. - Good night Daddy, thanks for dinner. - Hawking Clause may have a pot of money but he'll never have the Bouvier style. What are we gonna do when we graduate? - Daddy, I don't know. - Something befitting a princess. - I promise you one thing. I'll never be a housewife. - A grand beginning. Good night, sweet princess. [speaking in foreign language] - Good night Mr. Bouvier. It's like Clark Gable, romantic. - He's drunk. - He is drunk, look at him, he's staggering. [giggling and chattering] - Good night, Daddy. [honking] [chill lounge music] - Good evening sir. - Hi Yusha! Hi! [crowd chattering] [mic feedbacking] - Good evening ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends. My wife Janet and I would like to thank you for being with us tonight to share this special evening in honor of our daughter Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. [crowd clapping] [mild dance music] - Isn't she beautiful? - Yes, very beautiful. - Thank you for a marvelous party Uncle Hewdy. - I have a feeling my dear, you will always be in the spotlight. - I'm so happy. I love you and mother for giving me tonight. - May I? [crowd clapping] So, which one of these Yale guys do you have your eye on? - You know how I feel about these future lawyers, stockbrokers, business types you bring around. - Yes I know. Husband material. - Uh-uh, not for me. - How about some dashing movie star material? - Who's he? - Clay Holmby. He's available, and interested. - Really? It's such [mumbling] I don't know how you had the patience. - Well I like to watch you across the net. You look really swell out there. - Appearances aren't everything, you know. - Well I also happen to know that you're very intellectual. You have a reputation at Vassar for being the dark poetic type. - And you have the reputation at Wall Street for being the up and coming type. - Then we're the perfect match. - Ah! Since when do you read Vogue? - Since it has a photograph of you. For winning the essay contest. You beat out thousands of girls easily. [light music] My dreams? My dreams are to settle down, have a happy life. - Jackie. So, who was the lucky man tonight? - Ah, Clay Holmby. - Again? - So what? - So, Walter Winchell wants to know. What are Mr. Holmby's prospects, huh? - Well, he's perfect. Sweet disposition, very handsome. Volunteer medical service during the war. Served in Italy, France, Germany. - And you're bored to tears. - Oh, Yusha, something is very wrong with my life. - Oh now wait a minute. You made Life magazine. You're debutant of the year. Walter Winchell mentions you every other day. Elsa Maxwell was breathless. Why Jackie, you're famous. - Why, because I look a certain way? Because I'm related to someone called Auchincloss? Because I'm this year's candidate to marry some banker or lawyer who bore me to tears? Who am I? And what am I doing with my life that's worth a damn? - Well maybe it's time you found out. [exhaling] - This year, I shall trek to Vassar on weekends to visit you. - I'm not going back to Vassar. - No? - I don't wanna be a schoolgirl amongst schoolgirls. - Of course not. Hungry for experience. - I am so glad you understand. - Do you know what you wanna be? The first great woman stockbroker. [laughing] You have the brains and the guts. I'll take you into my firm. - Daddy, I don't think that's the real me. - Really? - I think I'm a writer. I love books, I'm good in languages. And I won that essay contest in Vogue. - Well fine, you can write novels in your spare time. Meanwhile I will teach you the brokerage business. - I want to write for a newspaper. - Well if you want to make your living telling lies you might just as well be a politician. - I mean real honest journalism. Washington journalism. I'm going to live at Marywood with mother and Hewdie so I can be close to Washington. - I see. Where the money is. - No, where important things are happening. - And New York City is not exactly a colonial outpost. It's me you're leaving. - Oh don't say that, Daddy. - Your mother has finally won you over. - She has not won. I'm not married yet, am I? Why do you and mother make it so hard for me to strike off on my own? - Because it's painful to watch someone you love struggle so. Believe me Jacks, I know where you belong. - I belong at the center of things. And that is where I intend to be. [light music] Excuse me, Jacqueline Bouvier. - I'm sorry. - Excuse me. Jacqueline Bouvier, inquiring photographer, Washington Times Herald. May I ask you a question? - What do you got in mind? - Chaucer once said that what women most desire is power over men. - Who said that? - Chaucer. Geoffrey Chaucer? The Canterbury Tales? What do you think women most desire? - I got a suggestion for you. Ask a woman. - Thank you very much. Jerk. [honking] Excuse me. - No, no ,no. - Excuse me, ma'am. Inquiring photographer, got a minute? - All right. - Chaucer. Someone once said that what women most desire is power over men. Do you agree with that? - Yes. - Great. May I take your picture? - Go ahead. You need help with that dear? - No, I'm fine, thank you. - Jackie, Jacqueline, I keep forgetting rhymes with fiend. The chief wants to see you. - Why? - I don't know, I guess he's been holding the presses waiting for today's late breaking headlines from the inquiring photographer. [phone ringing] [knocking] - Been looking at your stuff. - And? - Willy, come in here for a minute. - Yeah, boss? - How tall do you think Willy is, Miss Bouvier? - Maybe six feet? - Willy, lie there. - Huh? - Down, Willy, down. - Oh, okay. - Six feet from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. Six feet, you got it? - Yes. - This is exactly how far you would stand from the people you're taking pictures of. Thanks Willy, nice job. Take the day off. - Oh, thanks. - They're all out of focus, aren't they? - Either that or I should sue my eye doctor. - Well how about the copy? - Jackie, why don't you marry that nice young stockbroker from New York and live happily ever after? - Nobody takes me seriously around here, do they? - You're an attractive debutante whose stepfather got you the job, you tell me. - I know where I can be useful. There's a whole cultural scene in Washington that's not being well covered. The theaters, museums, auctions, art galleries. We report it like we're a suburb of New York but Washington has its own style. - Talk to me in six months. You've got to put your time in, kid. There's a long line for those glamor charts. You, get back on the street and keep it simple. [somber piano music] - The ghost that must be here watching us now. And men would kind of wander across the river struggling for their lives. Wondering when they were gonna see their wives again. [people chattering] - Congratulations on your engagement. Let me see the rock. Very nice, but what's this creeping green crud on your nails? - That's from the chemicals at the photo lab. I'm finally getting the hang of it, Yusha. - How does Clay feel about your working? - What do you mean? - I mean how are things between you and Clay? - Clay is fine, he's always fine. [barking] Get away. - Is it too late for me? - I should say so. Since the wedding's set for June. - Somehow, I think not. - So there's hope? - Does the expression "fat chance" mean anything to you? [car zooming] - Better. [phone ringing] - Inquiring photographer. Hi Martha. Oh I'd love to but my fiancee will be out of town. What? You mean come as a single woman? Martha, how could you suggest something so fun? Mhmm, see you then. [crickets chirping] [door slamming] [knocking] - Hi Jacqueline. - Hi Martha. - Come in. - I'm not late, am I? - No, everybody's here, come on in. - My family to have the singing chromosome in his gene pool. He was famous and he would sing it everywhere. - Excuse me. Jacqueline, I believe you know Tom and Nancy Pearson. - Sure, nice seeing you again. - Hello. - And this is congressman Jack Kennedy. - Hi. - Congressman. - Oh, you've met before, haven't you? - Yes. - I don't think so. [laughing] I'd remember. - Well, maybe not. Let me get you a drink. Excuse us please. Be right back. [men laughing] - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is he my date? - He's the most eligible bachelor in Washington. - Great, a politician. All they do is talk about themselves. - This one's different. He's a rising star, keep your eye on him. Let me check on them. - He was singing. He was appearing at a sandlot baseball game. He was run over by a truck. Now I can't explain how that happened but before the ambulance could pick him up and take him to the hospital, he insisted on sitting up and singing Sweet Adeline so everyone in town would know he's all right. [laughing] Let me freshen those drinks for you. - Do you sing, Congressman? - Well you know, on certain, I don't get many requests, frankly. I do plan to sing at the GNG Deli in Dorchester Massachusetts, but that's on a bet with some members of my staff. If I win the Senate seat I'm gonna sing. - I'd love to see that. - Well, come up to Massachusetts on election night and bring some earplugs. - Dinner. - Oh, I'm famished. - Starved. [everyone talking over each other] - Are you looking at me? - No, your asparagus. - Want some? - I have my own, thank you. - So you do. You know, the thick part's the best. - I prefer the tip. [giggling] - It's easier with the fingers, you know. You should try it. Very liberating. - Mhmm. - Hmm, really. It's the way we do it in Boston, try it. - Mhmm. - Come on try it, live dangerously. I dare you. - Okay, okay, we need one more point to win. I don't wanna say the pressure's on, Jackie but the pressure's on. Ready, and go. - It's a book, it's a book. - You're a palm reader. - Three words. - Okay three words. - Second word. - Little word, little word now. A, but, get, and, - And, and! - Oh no, what! - First word. First word, come on, come on. You're licking your fingers and you're very sexy, lick your fingers again. [laughing] A wallet, something in your wallet. Money, money. - Cash! - Dollar, cash! Cash. Coins, coins, coins. Luck, gambling. Cents, cents, cents! Cents and, sense and sensibility! Jane Austen, Jane Austen, yes! Haha! The winners! - Thanks Charlie. - Thank you so much, a lovely evening ,bye. - Can I give you a lift somewhere? - Thank you but this is my car. - What this? - I only make $42 a week at the newspaper. - I just thought, don't you live out at fancy Marywood place? - Yes, to save on rent. How do you know where I live? - I'm an inquiring Congressman. Look, let's have dinner. - I can't, I'm engaged. - Well I didn't say a date. It'd just be dinner. It'd be strictly a non-date sort of dinner. I mean you're a journalist. Can't a journalist and a politician have dinner together? [dog barking] - Ooh wha? Woohoo, wha, pooch, pooch. Nice dog. Hello, Jacqueline. - You know this guy? - I thought I told you to get lost. - I saw the car, I decided to wait. I was given to believe there's still hope for me. I just want you to know. I'm first in line. - Hey, don't let me interfere. - I say, come back here. Bad dog. - Really, this is very silly. - Well look, nice meeting you. Thanks for the dinner, Charlie. - Goodbye Jack. - I'm sorry about all this. Thanks for the game. - Good game. [exhaling] [phone ringing] - How do you feel when you get a wolf whistle? If you had a date with Marilyn Monroe, what would you talk about? Watch out Bouvier, you're getting creative in your old age. - You like my questions? - Your column's getting better. - When do I graduate to the society page? I'd be good at it. I know a lot of people. [phone ringing] - Yeah? I'm not her personal secretary. Okay, put him through. It's Congressman Kennedy for you. - Hello? - Hey, how's it going? What? Oh I'm doing great. Well we're just campaigning our butts off. All over Cape Cod, yeah. Listen, I'm gonna be back in Washington next Thursday. How about a movie? - That'll be fine, Jack. See you then. - Jack Kennedy. - As a matter of fact. - I hear he's gonna be the next Senator for Massachusetts. I'm impressed. But obviously, not as impressed as you are. [light music] - What'd you think? - I thought it was funny. You didn't seem to be having a very good time. - Oh no, no, it's just difficult for me to sit still for very long. My back. - Did you sprain it? - No, no, it's been going on for years. Had it operated on but nothing really helps. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I only told you that so you'd feel sorry for me and maybe hop in the sack. - I find it hard to talk about private things. - Catholic upbringing. Subscribe it must be simple. - I think I have the same Sunday school teacher as you. - Well you're very beautiful. What are you doing out with me anyway? - I was just so flattered that a busy Congressman would take time off. - Sorry, that was out of line. - So, this is how you grubby politicians operate, grab what you can get, huh? - So this is how you grubby journalists operate. Compromise idealistic young politicians? I don't grab just anything. I only grab the best. [hooves clacking] [horse neighing] - I heard you on the phone this morning breaking a date with Clay. - I just said I didn't want to go to New York this weekend and he couldn't come to Washington, so. - I already postponed the wedding once. When will you set a date? - Soon. - Don't keep the poor boy dangling. People are beginning to talk. - Do you think I could get married in purple? - You're talking like a child. Jacqueline, we all have parts to play in life. A woman may not choose what hers will be but she can carry it off with style and integrity. Find there's reward enough in that. [zooming] [birds chirping] [doorbell dinging] - Clay, I'm so sorry. Let me go and see what's keeping my sister. Can I get you anything? - No, thank you, I'm fine. - What's wrong with you? - I was just thinking about getting married to a wonderful man. - The wonderful man won't be there for long if you don't get your rear end downstairs. - Not him. Jack Kennedy. - Jack Kennedy? - Mhmm. - He'll never get married. - Oh yes he will. - Number one, he's 12 years older than you. Number two, all he cares about is his career. - That's not all he cares about. We understand each other. - There's something dangerous about Jack Kennedy. Kind of like Daddy. - Maybe that's what I like about him. - What happened to the girl who said she'd never be a housewife? - I wouldn't be a housewife if I married Jack. He'll always be at the center of things. - I've never seen you this way. - I've never felt this way. - Still, Clay Holmby is kind and generous, and - Totally dedicated to me, I know, I know. - Think about it. - I will. [crickets chirping] - Well. I guess this is goodnight, my love. - Goodnight, Clay. - Things haven't been right for a long time, have they? Still, it is a blow. - Clay, - No, don't say it. Goodnight, Jackie. [light piano music] - Hello, Miss Bouvier. [knocking] - Come in. - Hi. - Hi. - Lunch time. - Oh my, I completely forgot. I should have called you. I don't think I could go. I have much too much paperwork here. - [exhaling] If you insist. If Muhammad won't come to the mountain, the mountain will come to him. Please, don't let me interrupt you. - How did you do that? - Wouldn't you like to know? Now then. - All right, all right. - Mmm. - French mustard? - But of course. - I prefer American. - Nobody said you were perfect. [popping] I finished that art history paper. - Art history? - On Tishon, for you brother Teddy. - Right, Tishon for Teddy. And what about something for me? - Well I do have some ideas for your speech on Southeast Asia. - I think I'm more interested in domestic affairs. - Ah, I bet that was a quip, right? One of those spontaneous witticisms you're known for? - Hey, I got a million of them. - Mm, mm, mm, eat your asparagus. [light music] Your position is weak. - Really? Feels pretty good to me. - On Southeast Asia. - What about Southeast Asia? - You should read Paul Roove. - Who? - Paul Roove. - I'll do that, I'll read him right away. Right away, I'll get right on it. - Have you never heard of Paul Roove? - Why don't you tell me all about it? - Paul Roove has written the most incisive analysis of France's involvement in Vietnam. He wrote it in French. - I don't give a damn if he wrote it in Sanskrit. [radio chatter] [knocking] - Step out of the car, please. - Good evening officer. I'm Congressman Kennedy. - Yes sir. - This is Jackie Bouvier. - Stop. - Yes sir, well we've had a number of robberies and assaults in the neighborhood and I would advise you not to park here. - Well thank you very much officer. We'll certainly heed that advice. Appreciate it. - Ma'am. - Thank you. - Maybe we should go. - Why? - He said it was dangerous. - All the more reason to stay. [light music] [kids cheering] [door slamming] - Hit that baby. Woo! [cheering] - We got a play in second, play! Right here, right here! - Put me down, oh no! No, oh! - You're out of here! - She's out, no she's out. What do you think you're dressed for? - Don't be mean Jack, she looks lovely. - I can change. - No, no, you look great, you look great. Can't wait to see you slide into third in that. Well, everybody, this is Jackie Bouvier. Jackie, the family. This is my mother Rose. - How do you do, nice to meet you. - Hello. - It's my brother Bobby, Bobby's wife Ethel. It's my brother Teddy. And let's see who else. My sister Eunice. You keep track of this now, you're gonna be tested on this later. Let's see who else do we have here. - Take her inside, Jack. Make her comfortable. - Last but not least, my father the Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. - Hello. - Hello. - Come on, let's go inside. - Bobby, savers are up! - I didn't know I was supposed to dress for girl scout camp. - Come on chee, come on chee, bring it! [cheering] - Hey we'll take the deb on our team! Come on, over here! Hey. - Oh, I feel as if I'm in my second childhood. - That's why we all love it here. - And what position do you play? - Well I don't play much baseball. I used to do ballet though. - Hey, hey, the deb prefers ballet to baseball! [laughing] [players chattering] [cheering] - Strike! - Oh, all right. All right, everybody out in the field. Let's go, let's go. Let's hold them, gang. - Okay, we're up! Here you go. Three more innings before lunch. Can you make it? - Is baseball safe for your back? - Ah well, anything for the team. Save a little something for the races this afternoon. - What races? - Swimming. - No thanks, I'll leave that to the rah rah girls. - All right everybody's a hitter! - Okay Jackie, go deep! Deep! Way out! Deeper, deeper, no no, a little bit more. Hold up. - Go, Teddy. Yeah yeah, go, Jackie let go! [oohing] [cheering] [waves crashing] - How did you lose the game? - I told them I was unwell. An old school trick. - Oh yes. Miss Chapen, Miss Porter's or one of those Misses. - Chapen, Farmington and Vassar. - And the servant? - You know a lot about me. - I keep up. Mind if I sit down? - Of course. - What are you gonna do with all that education? - Just what your sons are going to do with Choud and Harvard. - Well that's a little different. - Why? - You're not one of these women's equality people, are you? - No, I don't find it necessary. - Good. My daughters can rough and tumble with the boys but when it comes down to it, they know their place. - Which is? - Push the men along. Jack's gonna be president, you know. First Catholic president of the United States. I wanted it for Joe Junior but he's gone and now it's up to Jack. - What does Jack want? - He wants it too. - I think you're right. - Nothing's gonna stand in the way. - Do you always get what you want? - Generally, yes. - That must be frightening. - Why should it be? Unless you're afraid of winning. Are you? - No. I love to win. - Good. We're a family of winners. We marry winners. I think you're a winner, Miss Bouvier. - What difference does it make what I think, Jacks? - It matters very much to me. [coughing] - I took him to lunch at the stock exchange. I showed him Wall Street. [coughing] And we took a walk and had a chat. - About what? - About politics, sports, and you know, what men talk about. - Women? - Women, that too, yes. That too. - Did you like him? - Aside from the fact that he needed a haircut he seemed like a decent little chap. [coughing] Surprisingly, he's not anything like his old man. [chattering] - Where the hell is Bouvier? - Here. - In my office. - The party's over huh? Look, I think this is the way it's gotta be done. - He came through. He's going to let me cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth the second. 300 words a day. And they're even gonna run my pen and ink sketches. - Wonderful, when do you leave? - I leave for London in two days. - So soon? - It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. - Oh it's great, it's great. It just gives you a conflict. - It does? - I'm supposed to address the BFW next week? I was gonna introduce you there as my fiancee. - Is this proposal contingent on my not being in England next week, Mr. Senator? - Well I'm a lot more fun than the Queen. I've met the Queen. Believe me, I know. You've become very important to me. - Oh? In exactly what way? - Let's not kid ourselves. I decided to marry you a year ago. I thought we should wait, but, knew all along you were the one. - How big of you. - Is that a yes or a no? - I'm not sure, you're making me nervous. - Good. It's natural to be nervous. - Not for me, I generally know what I want. But suddenly you're confusing me. - Hey, where are you going? - I'm going to London to do my job. I'll think it over. - Well give my regards to the Queen. - I'll do that. - I'm surprised. I thought you were head over heels. - I'm trying to use my head, mother, just that. - Frankly, I'm glad. Couldn't find a more bourgeois family than the Kennedys. Rich, huh, my ass. From dirty money. Bootlegging, I say. Wheeling and dealing on Wall Street. The old man sleeps with anything in a skirt. Gloria Swanson was just one of his mistresses. I'm sorry to say that Jack has the same reputation. - That's just gossip. - I should have listened to the gossip about your father. - You knew about Daddy but you wanted him anyway. - For a long time I did. But then the time came when I didn't. And he revolted me. You don't want to get to that point with your husband, Jacqueline. - I won't, mother. I learned from your mistakes. - I see. You think you can do it so much better than me. Well this isn't a horse show, you know. We're not competing against each other. - You've always made it seem that way. - Believe me, I, I just don't want you to lose at marriage the way I did. Go to London, have a fabulous time. And forget all about Jack Kennedy. [tense music] - Overseas operator, go ahead please. - Jackie? - Jack. - Hey, it's a good connection. Listen, did you get my cable? - Yes. Coronation articles excellent, you are missed. Missed by who? - Look, have you given any more thought to the thing we talked about? - The thing? You are so strange. Well I've been too busy to think about the thing as you so eloquently put. - What are you afraid of? - I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for your family. I'm afraid I'll disappear into them and never be heard from again. - Darling, you're very flattering to the Queen. Personally, I hated her dress. - You were at the coronation? - Oh yes. The galas were marvelous but during the ceremony, all I could think was how am I going to get to the ladies' room in this terrible crowd? - I've seen you in the movies. You have beautiful skin. - Oh thank you darling. I'll give you the name of my facialist in New York. - That's kind of you. Would you write it here? - Of course. Oh, you work for the Times Herald? That's very exciting. Why don't you look excited? - I went to London to think about marrying a wonderful but very complicated man. When we land he'll be waiting at the airport and I have to tell him yes or no. - And which will it be? - I'm not sure. [zooming] - Arriving international passengers may be met after they have cleared customs. - Jack darling! Oh, how clever of you to find me. - Jackie, do you know Alona? We're, what are we, we're old friends. - Yes, we met on the plane. - What a coincidence! Is this the wonderful man you were telling me about? - I assume these are for me. - Watch out for Jack, darling. Don't let him corrupt you. - He already has. [laughing] - Just an old, yeah. - Mm, hmm, ditto. - I missed you, Jackie. - I missed you too. [light music] - It may be you shall take my hand and lead me into this dark land and close my eyes and quench my breath. But I have a rendezvous with death at midnight at some flaming town when spring tips north again this year. And I to my pledged word and true. I shall not fail that rendezvous. Think that's my favorite. - That's beautiful. - Glad you're back. Thought we'd make the announcement next month. I also told Life magazine they can come up here. In July they wanna do some sort of feature on the young couple in the Yannas or some such thing. And we can be married in September. - All right. - So it's settled? What's the matter? - Nothing. It's just so hard to be married these days. But I love you, Jack. I want to be your wife. I want to have your children. - We'll have a good time. - Spoken like a true Kennedy. - I'm sorry, I, I don't know why it's so difficult for me to say. I love you, Jackie. And I know you love me. And all good things will follow from that. It's gonna be a huge wedding. - My mother will want something small and dignified at Marywood farm. - Well I hate to remind you. But you're marrying a United States senator. My father will have 2,500 people on his short list. - And you are marrying a Bouvier. We bend but do not break. - Now let's let our parents duke it out. It's gonna be their wedding anyway no matter what we do. - They can have the wedding. I'll take the honeymoon. - Really? - Mhmm. [light music] - See that Janet? - What is that called? - Oh, no, no, no. It's all wrong. You in the hat, move everything to the other side. Oh, 800 of Joe Kennedy's closest friends are coming tomorrow and nothing is done. - Mother, it will be fine. Are you sure you want the Fitzgeralds to sit next to the Cabots? After all, the Cabots speak only to the Lodges and the Lodges speak only to god. - Oh, I don't know anymore. The guest list is like a summit meeting. No! Not today, tomorrow, take them back. Take them back, it's tomorrow! Oh, can you believe this incompetence? Wait till I, - Thank you Yusha for all of this. I feel a little like a fish out of water. - Well to Jackie you're the most important person here. - What do you think? - Very handsome. - My father's. - Perfect. - I'll confess to you but to no one else. I had been preparing for this wedding almost as long as Jackie has. I've been exercising in the gym. I've been taking walks to get the sun. I wanna look magnificent when I escort her down the aisle. - Jackie's looking forward to that moment more than anything, believe me. I have your instructions here. You know Janet, she's typed up a very precise list of pre-wedding festivities for each guest. - Ah the rehearsal dinner. The cocktail parties. All of the things at which I excel. It says here that I'm to report to the church at 10:30. Are there no other events? - Well I, I suppose there must be. - But I've not been invited. [somber music] Thank you Janet. Thank you for your superb hospitality. [light music] - You look exquisite. - I'm not even nervous. Why aren't I nervous, is something wrong? - I've got your case of nerves, that's what's wrong. [phone ringing] Oh. If that's chef again, I swear I'll explode. Hello? - I'm here with him now. Uh, no. Well no I wouldn't say that. Actually he's in pretty bad shape at the moment. But I think I can get him sobered up in time. - No, no. I don't think that's a good idea. We'll find a substitute. Yes, thanks for calling. - Everything all right in the kitchen? - Yes, fine. [crowd shouting over each other] - Jackie, Jackie! - Jackie, your father's not feeling very well. - What's the matter with him, where is he? - Nothing serious. He's at the hotel. He's just, not up to being here today. - He's all right. He was nervous. He had a few drinks. - He's not going to be with me? - Take my arm. I'd be proud to do the honors. [people chattering and cameras clicking] [church organ music] [priest speaking in foreign language] - Do you John, take Jacqueline for your lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother the Church? - I do. - And do you Jacqueline take John for your lawful husband according to the rite of our holy mother the Church? - I do. [priest speaking in foreign language] [organ music playing] [people chattering] [bell tolling and crowd cheering] [door slamming] [somber music] - I wanted him to be there. - I know, I know. - On my wedding day. I wanted it so much. - It's one of the hardest things you've ever done. But you carried it off. I'm proud of you Jacqueline. - Oh mother. - Oh darling. [sobbing] - Dear Daddy, I want you to know that I understand the pressure you were under on my wedding day. The crowds and the newspapers and family tensions must have been very hard. I'm not angry with you. I forgive whatever lapses might have occurred. I love you always. And in my heart I know it was you who accompanied me down the aisle after all. - I do believe married life agrees with you. [speaking in foreign language] Let's go jump in the ocean. - I can't, I have to write a letter. - Well I have to write a polished statement about the need for better negro education in the south. Some sexy honeymoon. - Just give me a minute. - All right, I'll meet you down there. - You be careful of the sharks. I hear there are sharks in Mexico. - You'll come down to get me, okay? - Okay. [festive Mexican music] [speaking in foreign language] [laughing] [speaking in foreign language] - Oh! [laughing] - My goodness gracious. - I think I'd stick with that. - Yeah I think it's good. - Whoah. Here you are. - Hey, everybody, it's my bride Jackie. This is Consuela and Pilar and Maddie, and Ellen and Mary. My wife Jackie. - Hello. - How you been? - I was worried about you. - I'm fine. Want a margarita? Here you go, it's a national drink or something. Have a sip. [honking] See you later. - Jack, you can't leave without breakfast. - I'm late. Larry's outside for the subcommittee meeting at nine. - Oh but I made scrambled eggs. Here, have a taste. - Taste remarkably like scrambled eggs. And what is this? Household hints? Did you do all this? - No, my dressmaker. Wasn't she sweet? It's become my bible. - Anything in there about separating the shell from the egg prior to scrambling? [laughing] [exhaling] - Don't you just love this house? The way the light pours into the rooms in the morning? I want to get rid of these heavy draperies and put something sheer on the windows. - Jackie, we're only renting this place. - It's our first home together. And it's only the draperies. - All right, whatever you say. - You ought to see the doctor again about your back. - Eh, it's no worse than it ever was. - No better either. Mmm, second best time of the day. - Really, what's the first? - Figure it out. - Okay. Now feet parallel. There you go, knees flexed. That's right, right elbow relaxed and watch the club strike the ball. Well, well. - Progress. Not bad, eh Yusha? - I said, maybe this is none of my business, but why are you doing this? - Doing what? - The golf lessons, the cooking classes. The social teas, bridge club? You hate those things. Why are you doing this? - Well it's all part of learning how to become a senatorial squall. As my mother said, we each have our part to play. I guess at least for now this is mine. Anyway, it makes Jack happy. Ooh, that looks bad. How do I get out of there? - When you're in a trap, you get out any way you can. - Jackie? Where the hell's my briefcase? - It's right here. - What's for lunch today? - I didn't know you were coming home for lunch. - Me and the delegation about 20 from the Greek embassy. Remember? Uh-oh, see you at one. [dial clicking] - Hello, Tony? Jacqueline Kennedy. You know those wonderful little Greek casseroles you make? Yes well I need enough for about 20, no 30 people. As soon as possible. Thanks. - Well I'll have my office check into that. I can't guarantee anything right away but we can certainly try as best we can do. Hi, excuse me. - So, how did I do? - Did you have something to do with all this? Hold down the fort for me will you? Got a call in the office. Glad you could make it. - Tea cans. [men chattering] - Good isn't it? It's my own recipe. Oh, ugh! Jackie, Jackie! Jackie! - Kennedy, Senator Kennedy. - Jack. [men mumbling] - Ow, ow! [tense music] [siren sounding] [tense music] - Apparently the damage to the vertebra which dates from 1944 has never healed properly. Have you seen any significant regeneration of muscular support around this vertebrae, Dr. Jordan? - No. And I'm sure that the increased pain the Senator is suffering indicates continued deterioration. - Right, right, right. So where are we? - Well first of all, of course we have to wait for the test results. But you know my reservations. I do not think that surgery of any kind is the answer. - Well let's all get clear on one thing. I'd rather be dead than spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair. [phone ringing] - Thank you for coming, Yusha. - Of course. How is he? - They're still doing tests. The doctors can't decide whether to operate or not. - Well that makes it difficult. - And his publicity men are playing up the hero angle. Glorious war injury from PT109 saving somebody's life. The truth is he's had Addison's disease for years. Uh, we have no privacy. Even his back pain becomes political. - I'm afraid that's what you signed up for. - I'm scared to death. But of course I can't let him know. - And I want you to let me know right away if anything changes on that. Hey. - Hi, how you feeling? - Never better. Yusha. - Nice to see you Jack. - See you. The Senate may actually censure Joe McCarthy. - How will you vote? - Well I'm in the hospital, I don't have to vote. [laughing] - Nice choice of her. - Sophomore accumulate the members of my staff. Well, don't you two look cheery. - Senator, we need to talk to you. - I'll be right outside. - Tests are back. There's no sense in delay. We're scheduling the operation for tomorrow. - Sheryl, what is it? - Look Jack, it's bad. Your Addison's disease complicates everything. You're already well aware of your adrenal insufficiency. But you add to that a badly weakened immune system and what you have are some very serious post-operative risks. - Life is a risk. I think we should go ahead. And I'm sure we all understand there's no need to talk about Addison's disease outside this room. - Let me explain exactly what's going to happen. - Can I have a moment alone with my wife please? - Certainly. - Heard any good jokes lately? Come on, come on. - I'm fine. It's going to be okay. - Sure it is. Whatever happens, I'm counting on you. We're a team, right? - Right. - Ah, we got the luck of the Irish. - Oh Jack. [somber music] - This is as far as you can come. - Take good care of him. - Let's go, Jack. [siren sounding] [tense music] - Nurse! [phone ringing] How bad is he, Sarah? - A massive infection has set in. - What does that mean? - It's very serious. - He's not going to die. - Jackie, you know we're doing everything we possibly can to help him. [exhaling] [somber music] [speaking in foreign language] - It's bad, isn't it? - Very. They've given him the last rites. - The entire Kennedy family is downstairs. I can't keep them away any longer. - I'll take care of them. - And about these telegrams. It's Hadley Stevenson, Linden Johnson, Bernard Barouk. - I'll take care of the telegrams. [reporters shouting over each other] - All of you must leave here right now. Sir, please call the police and have these people removed. - Who are you? - Mrs. John Fitzgerald Kennedy. - Yes, ma'am. [reporters shouting over each other] [orchestral music] - Hey, hey, hey, take it easy there. What do you think you got a side of beef? The boy just had surgery. - Joe, let's go around the back. - No, we're gonna go right up the front. Right up the front steps. Very carefully now. He's got a hole in his back a mile wide. - Welcome to Kennedy country. - Hey, Jack. Up and at 'em. - Hiya, sis. Hi, Mom. - Your bedroom's all ready, Jack. I even turned on the air conditioning. - Gosh, Rose. Don't break the bank. - Now, now, now. We're gonna be here for a while. Try to be nice. - I'm trying. - Well, he looks like hell. - I'm sure he'll feel a lot better after a few games of touch football. - Ready and lift. - I hope you're planning to stay until he's totally recovered. - Well, we'll have to since we gave up the Georgetown house. - You'll take your meals with us. I'll have a tray prepared for Jack in his room. - Would you mind if I ate with him? - I truly think he'll need his rest. - She'll want to be with her husband. - Well, whatever you like. As long as you feel at home. - Mom loves having us back in the fold. - I appreciate everything you're doing, but once Jack is on his feet, we'll be searching for a place of our own. - Fine. No rush about it, Jackie. No rush at all. - Hello. - Hello, dear. - Thank you, Faye. - Hello, hello. - Who's there? Hey. - These came from the Library of Congress. - Uh-oh. I got a feeling I'm gonna hear more about Daniel Webster. - Mm-hmm. I'm going to prove to you that he should be in your book. - Maybe I should do a chapter on you. Putting up with all this. - No, you're the brave one, but then you put on that cute little grin. No one knows how much it hurts. - Certainly not the doctors. You'd think with all the money we give them they could come up with something that works. - You know, I asked doctor Terrell if there's a shot that would take away the pain once and for all. She said there was, but it would eliminate all sensation below the waist. - We can't have that, can we? - Mm-mm. No, we can't. [laughs] - Anybody watching? - Yes, your mother is there. - Of course she is. - It's a powerful book. Powerful title, Profiles in Courage. I like that word, courage. - Jack's very proud of the way it turned out. - I understand you had something to do with the writing of it. - Here and there. - And Harper and Brothers are gonna publish it thanks to you? - I had some connections. - I said you're a winner, just like the Kennedy's. Now, we're gonna make this book a winner. - Joe, a book isn't a political candidate. You can't just make a best seller. - Two phone calls. One to make sure we get the rave reviews, the other to have my people across the country buy up every single copy as it appears in the book stores. That's how you make a best seller. - I have to admire you, Joe, from a distance. I want our new home to be just perfect. Lee, is this straight? - It's straight. - Does the tail need to come up a bit? - Take the nose down a little, I think. - Jacqueline, will you please get down from there? - Mother, just a minute. - Lee, why are you letting your sister do that? - Because she's older. - There, how's that? - Hideous. - Thank you. This is my house and I want it to look really hideous. Jack caught it on our honeymoon. - Lots of people catch lots of things, but they don't put them on the wall. - Whose side are you on? - The fish's side. - Well, what's the matter with her? - Her marriage is on the rocks and her sister is pregnant. - I thought she was happy for me. - I remember not too long ago how you talked about the Kennedy sisters. Baby machines, you called them. Line them up and they get pregnant. But, truth is you were jealous. - That's what Kennedy women are supposed to do, make babies, make politics. - You don't have to be one of them. - Mother, before we have another fight about the Chicago convention, why don't you let me show you upstairs. - Oh, yes, yes. It's lovely. Lovely, Jacqueline. I still don't think you should go in your condition. - Mother, Jack might get the vice presidential nomination. - He can get it without you. - He thinks my being there will help. - Well, you tell Joe Kennedy I'd rather have a healthy grandchild. You tell him. [people chattering] - This is my wife, Jackie. Nice crowd, kid. - Best money can buy. - I know it would make a big difference and we won't forget you know, afterwards, but it would make a big. Excuse me. Excuse me just a moment? Thanks. - Five minutes until the Utah delegation. - All right, I'll be there. - When's your baby due? - September. - Oh, well you're very brave, Jackie, to come in your condition. - I'm sure you'd do the same thing, Mrs. Johnson. - Please, call me Lady Bird. - All right. - Yeah, those good old boys would've brought you in here on a stretcher if they thought they'd won a delegate. Is this your first convention? - Mm-hmm. - Tribal rights. Well, it shouldn't be too bad for you. - Well, a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Jack isn't looking for delegates, is he? - No, I don't think he's looking. - Well, neither is Lyndon. But, I guess I better go do my duty. You know, put on a big smile, laugh at the jokes, remember all the names. Lyndon says that Jack has a very bright future in the senate. He says he has his eye on him. [girls laughing] - I saw him before you. - Oh, really? - Fellow delegates, fellow Democrats and guests of the convention. I have decided that the selection of the vice presidential nominee should be made through the free processes of this convention. The choice will be yours. The profit will be the nation's. - It's over, Jack. Kefauver's got it wrapped up with a big silver bow. - He hasn't got the delegates. - He's close enough and Adlai wants him. - That's not what Adlai said. - Maybe not in public. - Larry, how many votes can we count on? - We're about a hundred short. - Folks, let's take a long, hard look before we make this run, huh? - Ribacoff's set to place my name in nomination. What are you saying, George? You don't want a second? - Hell, boy. I'd be pleased with a second. I just don't want to be talking to myself. - You're not gonna be. We're gonna win this thing. Just think of it as a challenge. - Ah, like climbing Mount Everest in sneakers, hmm? - I'm telling you you're lucky Jack didn't get it. Stevenson can't take Eisenhower. If Jack had run with Stevenson, they'd blame the loss on Jack being a Catholic. - Next, you'll be telling us to be good losers. - I'd never say that around this family. - How are you feeling? - [sighs] Tired. Poor Jack. He really wanted the nomination. - Only because it was there. [laughs] - Well, I've just been speaking to the Pope and he said, our old man. He sends the following communique. Quote, "If you're gonna get licked, get licked for first place, not second" end quote. In 60, we go for the top spot. - The White House in 60. - Jack, you want me to cancel Italy? - Oh, right, the victory cruise. I haven't even thought about it. I don't know. Jackie, what do you think? Want to go away for a couple of weeks? - No, thank you. I could float over there by myself. Why don't you go? - Without you? - Mm-hmm. You guys take the trip. You've all worked so hard. Especially Jack. - Yes, the rains have been good to my plants this year. I mean, look how lovely this is. I could be perfectly happy doing nothing else but working in my garden. [gasps] - Mother. - What's wrong? Jacqueline? I'll call a doctor. [siren wailing in distance] - Where's my baby? Bobby, is the baby all right? - Jackie, I'm so sorry. The baby died. [wistful music] - Was it a boy? - It was a girl. - Why? - They had to do an emergency cesarean. She didn't suffer. She never even took her first breath. - Where's Jack? - We're calling him in Italy. He'll be here soon. [people laughing] - Will you sign your book for me, Jack? - Oh, sure. Well, let's see. [people laughing] [water splashing] - You don't mean that. - Try me. [girl laughs] - Hey, Jack! You better come in here and cool off! - I think you may be right about that, Georgie. Come on, let's go for a swim. - It's all my fault. I never should've gone to the convention. - It's Jack's fault for not being here for you. - Have they gotten through to him yet? It's been three days. - They say the boat doesn't have a ship to shore radio. - Or else it's turned off. I don't trust that senator he's with, or Teddy. - What about Jack, the golden boy himself? [siren wailing in distance] I don't know whether this will make it easier or harder for you, but I think you should know. Friends of mine in Italy have seen Jack in the company of a young woman. - Just, just wait a second. Grazie. - [speaking Italian] - Uh, si. - [speaking Italian] - I've never heard Jackie like this. - Well, what did you expect? - Let's go for a walk or something. - Jack. - I don't know what to do, George. - Well, I'll tell you one thing. If you ever want to be President of the United States, you haul your ass back to your wife. [knocking on door] [door opens] [siren wailing in distance] - I should've been here. - I failed you. - No, Jackie. - And you failed me as a husband, a friend, someone I thought I could trust. - I know. - You don't know. You have no idea what I've been through and I don't even think you care. - Are they giving you anything for the pain? - Yes, yes. Doesn't help. Your sister Pat had a baby two days ago. - I heard. - And Ethel's due next month. She won't lose her baby. - Come on, come on now. This isn't some kind of race. - Of course, Kennedy wives are expected to do. Make babies, make politics and turn the other way when it comes to their husband's indiscretions. I guess I failed at all three. - What do you mean? - You forget, I grew up with one of the greatest philanderers of all time. I know exactly how it's done, Jack. - I'm gonna start spending more time at home. - We don't have a home. I'm going to live with my mother in Newport. - Now, wait a minute. You wait a minute now. I've lost my daughter. I've lost her too, you know? Now, suddenly, I'm losing my wife? - Not so sudden, Jack. Not so sudden. It took five days. Five days of laying here alone during the lowest time of my life needing my husband to be with me. Finally realizing, he never will be. [subdued music] [crying] - I tried to save you from it. - You couldn't save me from growing up, Daddy. - Could've kept you safe in New York if you'd have married that stock broker. - I would've been miserable anyway. I don't think there are any men who are faithful to their wives. Men are such a combination of good and evil. - Here's to men, here's to women, and here's to the good and evil in all of us. [sighs] - High-born ladies like Jackie weren't meant to have children. - Rose. - It wasn't criticism. - You could've fooled me. - She's too refined to give birth. - Maybe we should just drop this. - She doesn't have the constitution of a normal woman, that's all. - I don't like the rumors. Time Magazine makes it sound like you're headed for a breakup. - Hasn't gone that far. - She's moved out on you, hasn't she? - Oh, no. She just won't stay at Hickory Hill. She says it reminds her of the baby. She's gonna be with her mother in Newport. - You better go and talk to her. - I will, after I get back. - Where are you going? - A 14 city tour for Adlai. - Nothing's gonna save that egghead and nothing's gonna save your career if your marriage ends up in the crapper. - It' won't. - What the hell is going on with you and Jack? - Why don't you ask Jack? - Papers are saying the marriage is in trouble. People are talking about it. Jack can't afford that kind of publicity. - That's what you're really worried about, isn't it? Jack's image. - Don't tell me what I'm worried about. I'm here to get this thing back on the track. - He should be here trying to get it on track. - Jack's got a job to do for the party. - Exactly. These are Jack's priorities. Politics, other women, the Kennedy family. And then maybe, vaguely, he remembers he has a wife. - Jack loves you. There's a difference between love and sex. Come on, you're a big girl. You know that. - The hell with it, Joe. I'm not going to live like that. - What will it take to get you to come back? - What is this, a business deal? - I asked the question. - All right. More time alone with Jack, less time with the family. - Fine. - That means when we're in Hyannis Port, or Palm Beach, we have dinner with you once a week, not every night. - Fine. - You better straighten that out with Rose. - Done. - No more phone calls during dinner and at all hours. You straighten that out with Jack. - Okay. - I want a home of my own. - Name it. - Washington, so Jack can come home for dinner. I want a house in Georgetown and a free hand in decorating it as a gift from you. - Within reason. - No, absolutely outside of reason. - You're a tough kid. Okay, what else? - A million dollars in cash. [laughs] I'm just kidding. - You can have it if you want it. - Am I that much of a political asset? - Let's just say, I want you to be happy. - Then, fix it so I can have a baby. How are your connections in that one, Joe? - I'll put in a word for you upstairs. [laughs] - Deja vu. - Did you say something? - It's gonna look terrific. Come here. Be careful. Gotta be careful these days. Happy Birthday, Mrs. Kennedy. - Thank you, Jack. They're lovely. I'll wear them tonight. - Tonight? What's tonight? - Birthday party at my mother's. It's okay. You remembered the most important part. [phone ringing] - Where the hell is the phone? Hello? Hi, Lee. Yeah, she's right here. It's your sister. - Just remember, when I get a year older, you get a year older, too. Do they think it's serious? Well, should I fly to New York? [sighs] Okay. Fine, I'll see you tonight. My father's in the hospital for tests. - Is he all right? - They're not sure, but Lee says it isn't critical. - You don't think you should fly up and see him? - No, I don't think it's that bad and my mother's been planning this party for weeks. She'd be devastated. I'll fly up and see him tomorrow. - See you later. - Bye. [mournful music] - I don't recognize any of them back there. Are they Bouviers? - Oh, they're not family. More like a fan club. I've heard that women say once you've been with Black Jack Bouvier, no other man will do. - Not a bad epitaph. Let me hold her. - She's pretty, isn't she? - Sure, she is. She looks just like you. Caroline Bouvier Kennedy. Welcome to the world. - Daddy, I wish you were here. Strange, isn't it? A life for a life. - Bobby, call O'Brian and get the Wisconsin information. - I'll get right on it. - Three to one Sinatra returns my call before he returns your call. [phone ringing] - Yeah? Frank, how are you? Sure, we're ready to run for the White House. Are you with us? Do something for me. Talk to Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen about putting new lyrics to High Hopes as a campaign song for Jack. And you'll record it. What do you say? Good. Hey, hang on a minute. - How are you doing? Listen, are you gonna be out there during the convention? [laughs] Well, I look forward to that. Yes, yes, all right. Listen, thanks for helping with the song. It's great. All right, I'll talk to you. - Frank loves the idea. Have him play it at the convention. I won't be there. - What do you mean you won't be there? - I'm staying in the background on this one. - You worked your whole life for this. - Let's be smart. The so-called liberals don't like me, but you need 'em to win. I can run things from here. - Three sixes. - Let me tell you something. Don't hide Jackie. Put her out there where everybody can see her. - You know she fights all that. - Jackie and I understand each other. She may not admit it, but sees getting a taste of power. She's got a whiff of the White House. She'll work her ass off until she gets there. - Mommy's gotta go away on a big trip with Daddy, but I'll call you every day. And I'm gonna miss you very much. But, Maude. Well, Maude will give you a bath and tell you a bedtime story. Would you like that? Will you give Mommy a kiss? All right, sweetheart. Now, Maude's gonna take you upstairs. - Come, Caroline, darling. - Bye-bye, angel. Bye-bye. I love you. - Watch your step, dear. - Bye. - Hi, how are you? Jack Kennedy. Hope you'll vote in the primary. - Hello. Hello, thank you for coming. - Nice to meet you. Jack Kennedy. This is my wife, Jackie. Hi, my pleasure. Jack Kennedy. My wife Jackie. How do you do? - Please, vote for my husband. - Would you vote for John Kennedy? Need your vote in the primary. Here you go, sir. - Tom, how are you? - Good shift. - Hi, Jack Kennedy. Hope you vote in the primary. Hi, how do you do? How do you do? - Please, vote for my husband. - Hi, Jack Kennedy. Pleasure. - Mr. Kennedy, I wanted to ask you a question. What brings you here? - Well, we're here in Wisconsin because we're very concerned abut unemployment in this part of the country and hopefully you'll come out and vote in the primary April 5th so we can do something about it. - I will. - My wife, Jackie. [gasps] - Jack, what's the matter? - Go back to sleep, go back to sleep. I just wanted to see if they put a board under the mattress. I think they didn't. - Is your back bad? - I should be using the crutches more. - I'll give you a massage. - Would you? Great, wait. [grunts] Ow. My goodness, how many hands did you shake today? [laughs] - Who can count? - Well, you're doing great. People love you. - I miss Caroline so badly it hurts. [phone ringing] - Hello? Yeah? Oh, yeah, Larry. What? No, it's okay. What's the problem? Oh, no. Come on. Well, I've got a big fund raiser in Madison tomorrow night. I understand, but. All right. Let me think about it. I'll call you back. - What is it? - Civil rights bill is coming up for a vote tomorrow. It's critical I be there. Got a full day of appearances here, a fund raiser tomorrow night in Madison. If I miss those I can kiss this primary goodbye. Of course, if I miss the civil rights vote it'll haunt me all during the campaign. - What if I stay? - What do you mean? - You go to Washington and vote, I'll stay here, go to the fund raiser, and make the rest of the stops. - I don't know. It's a lot of work. In your condition. What about the baby? - You're going to win here, I can feel it. You'll be on your way and then I can stay home and be pregnant. - You like the crowds, don't you? - I hate it and the press. - Yeah, but you don't exactly mind all the attention. - Jack, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. - All right. - We have a lock on our first ballot victory if we can bring in the fence sitters. - We've got it wrapped up, Dad. No problems. - Nobody's got anything wrapped up, Bobby. You make sure every one of those delegates is on the floor an hour before roll call. Teddy, you stay in touch with all the delegations. If you have any problems, call Larry or Kenny on the walkie talkie. - I've worked that out with Teddy, Mr. Ambassador. Where the hell is Jack? - He's in the water with Caroline. Do you want me to get him? - No, leave him alone. Once he gets the nomination, he won't have much time for her. Another thing, Bobby. You make sure that Jack's friends stop thinking of him as one of the guys. I'll tell you all something right now. The day will come when you will no longer call him Jack. You will call him Mr. President. - One bucket of water coming right up. Here you go. - Right here. - All right, Caroline. Pat that down, pat that down. Let's pour a little water right here. I'm gonna talk to your mom for a minute. Can you take over here? Can you do this by yourself? All right. Hey, have you thought any more about coming to the convention? - I told you. Wisconsin was the last stop. - You were great in Wisconsin that's why we need you in Los Angeles. - I know I was great. I was so great in Chicago that I lost the baby. - Aw, come on. The 56 convention had nothing to do with you losing that baby. - Jack, of course it did. - I'm going out to accept the Democratic nomination for the presidency of the Untied States and I'm not going out there without my wife. - Four years ago I was a naive political wife desperately trying to please you and your family. Now, I'm a mother and I know what's important. I'm staying home. - That's just great. Well, what do we got here? - Huh? - You should work around the house. This is sensational. - Here in Los Angeles, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are being greeted to the tune of the Kennedy theme song of High Hopes playing to a tumultuous crowd. [sharp banging] - Will the delegates please take their seats? The 35th quadrennial convention of the Democratic Party of the Untied States is now called in session. - Hiya, Peter. - Hello, Jack. - Good to see you. Remember Kenny O'Donnell? - Yes, of course. - Peter Lawford. - Nice to see you again. - Please. Welcome to Hollywood. - I thought this was a political convention. - Oh, same thing, you know that. - Would you gentlemen care to order a drink? - I'll take a light Scotch. - Sounds good. - Another double, Rudy, if you please. - Yes, Mr. Lawford. - Well, well, well. Look who's here. - Good evening, Rudy. - Marilyn. - Look, there's Marilyn. She's even prettier in person. - Marilyn, I'm shocked. You're almost on time. - Why, Peter. I'm always on time for the senator. - Hi. - Hi. - Maybe we better sit down. You remember Kenny? - Oh, sure. - So, how's the picture going? - All right, I guess. [laughs] What I do seems so unimportant compared to what all you gentlemen are accomplishing. It was wonderful seeing you today talking to the press on television. - What'd you think? - As usual, you were quite penetrating and democratic. - Marilyn, what would you like? - I'll have whatever the senator is having. - Uh, light Scotch for Ms. Monroe, if you please. Thank you. - Yes, sir. - You still smoking? - Trying to quit. - Say, do you two kids want to be left alone? - Oh, no. We like a crowd. Don't we, Jack? - Uh, hope you can make it to the coliseum tomorrow night. - What's playing? - The senator's going to accept the nomination. - Oh, I'll try to rearrange my schedule. - Swing by my beach house afterwards. All the Democratic nominees will be there. - How's the back? - You know. - I always make his back feel better. - But, our NBC poll from the caucus was right on target. - Wyoming! Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Wyoming's vote will make majority to Senator Kennedy. - I know, I know. Your daddy's going to run for President of the United States. Are you ready for that? Am I? - How'd you bake this? - What do you think? - She made this cake. - It is wonderful. - Incredible thing. - Thank you very much. - I wouldn't believe it. - I can't stand it. Excuse me. - We're trying to settle here so far without any success or without enough success. One of the closest elections in the history of the United States. - One of the big surprise so far this evening. - Can't look? - Mm-hmm. - In the south. Right now, Nixon, I believe, is. Let me check currently is leading in only two border states. Tennessee and Kentucky, and also in the state of, there was one other in the south he was leading in a second ago. - Well, he is now. - How are we doing? - This is the longest night of my life. [phone ringing] - Hello? Yeah, Bobby? How's Texas? - What does he say? - We can't stand it. We have to watch. - I see before dessert Nixon was ahead. - What do you got there? - Photos of the family. Which do you like best? - For the newspapers? - Mm-hmm. Just in case. - Jack, you just won Florida. - What? Yes. What? Bobby, I can't hear you. - Kennedy at nine states for the total of 105. And one state, Mississippi, the unfledged electors are in the lead with a total of 8 votes. - Oh, Jack. This is wonderful news. See now Florida was an important state, wasn't it? - [laughs] Yeah, darling. Florida was very important. - Why don't you go over to Bobby's. They're getting results faster than the television. - Jackie, he's ahead. - What? - Jack. - Kennedy leading with 10 and a half million. Nixon about nine and a quarter million. - Your president now. - No, no, no. Don't say that. It's bad luck. It's still too early. Yeah. Bobby, you getting that? Yep. I don't know, I don't know. [door creaks] - What time is it? - It's just past three. - Did we win? - It's too close to tell. [sighs] [doorbell rings] [dogs barking] [doorbell rings] - Yes? - Secret Service, Mrs. Kennedy. - What's the problem? - No problem, ma'am. We're here to provide security for the president elect. - No more for me, I'm stuffed. - Thanks. You tired, sweetie? Go with Maude for a nice nap. - Nap time. Sleep tight, darling. - Bye. Good girl. - Nice Thanksgiving. - Yes, well, it wasn't with your parents. - Maybe you should go back to bed. - Those reporters are still out there. It'll only get worse when we move into the White House. - One of the prices you pay for looking the way you look is that people want to keep their eye on you. - I don't like being exposed and I don't like my children being exposed. - Come here. - See those fellas with the big shoulders? Secret Service. The most sophisticated law enforcement agency in the world. I read that in the Washington Post so I know it's true. - Yes, well, I still don't feel safe. - It's your female hormones. - You always say that. You never take me seriously. - I take you very seriously. Anyone who lives in my house, shaped the way you're shaped, rates a very high degree of seriousness. You go snuggle up in bed. I'll call you from Palm Beach. - He's coming. - Senator, Senator. [reporters chattering] - How's Jackie's health? How's the baby? - Mr. Kennedy, how's the transition going? [tense music] [gasps] - What's happening? - You've gone into premature labor, Mrs. Kennedy. We have to do an emergency cesarean. - Please, save my baby. - We'll do everything we can. [propellers humming] - Captain's turning the plane around. We should be back in Washington in about 90 minutes. - Stay by the radio, will you Larry? - Yeah. - 90 minutes? We're not gonna make it. - Don't worry, we're going to make it. - She didn't look right, you know? I had a feeling. You know how sometimes you just? Damn, I should be there. - Have a drink. There's nothing you can do about it now. - He's okay. The baby was born. He's okay. - Oh, thank you, God. Did you say he? - Yeah. He's six pounds, three ounces. He's in an incubator, but he's okay. [laughing] [exhales] - What are you going to call him. - John Jr. He's okay. - He's okay. - He's okay. I knew he was okay. I knew he was okay. - The nurse said he looks just like you. - I can live with that. Although the doctor said he looked just like you. - Oh, I hope not. - Turn? Yeah, it's right down this way. You okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, Jackie. [camera shutter clicking] - Jack, Jack, Jack. - Hey, easy. - Down on the floor. - Don't let him touch me. - Ow, go easy, go easy. - Why can't they leave us alone? - Take it easy, guys. Just get the film. - You said they'd protect us. - Secure the exits! [crowd chattering] - Do you, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear. - I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear. - That you will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States. - That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States. - And will to the best of your ability. - And will to the best of my ability. - Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. - Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. - So help you God. - So help me God. [applause] - What a day, Jack. - Inauguration day dawned on the Capital that has been almost paralyzed by a full fledged blizzard. - I'm cold just watching it again. I still have a chill. - Aren't you going to join us downstairs? Some of your relatives have traveled thousands of miles just to shake your hand. - I can't, Mother. I just can't. - Mrs. Auchincloss, if I had just had a cesarean section and then had to get dressed to attend five or six balls that evening, I'd need a rest, too. - I really don't like what you're doing to her hair. Tell her it's wrong. Get her to change her mind. - I'm wearing it this way, Mother. That's all. - Well, it looks like a rat's nest. I hope you can pull it off. - Don't worry, I will. [fireworks exploding] ["Hail to the Chief"] [applause] [slow orchestral music] - It is customary during the changing of the guard the First Lady to address the White House staff as a group. - Yes, well. I don't want to do that. I'll meet with each one individually. And please, don't call me the First Lady. My name is Mrs. Kennedy. - Chief housekeeper, Mable Walker. - Pleased to meet you. First of all, I want everything done to ensure the utmost privacy for myself and my two children. All White House tours to be suspended in the afternoon while my children nap. After all, this is our home and it should be run as a home with the convenience of the President and his family. Don't you agree, Mrs. Walker? Good, then sign here. It says you agree not to talk about your employment with the Kennedy's. Now, I want my sheets changed twice a day and fresh bath and hand towels three times a day. You like it? Our new French chef. - It's great. We're getting flak because he's not an American chef. - Then, make him American. Push his naturalization papers through. - I also got a memo from the Director of General Services. - Oh, him. - He says you're way over budget on this White House renovation. - And he wants me to stop. - Jackie. You can't spend the taxpayer's money like a teenager with a first charge plate. It doesn't look good. - Jack, I'm trying to do something useful. I want to do more than sit at meaningless state dinners smiling at important men's wives. Guten Abend, Frau Eisenhower. Your husband, his English is so wunderbar. My dear Queen Frederica, such a lovely hairdo and you, too. Jack, I want to wake this place up and leave something tangible behind after we're gone. The White House should be a place for all Americans to visit. I want them to feel inspired by what they've seen. - Terrific public relations, but there's no money. - I'll get the money. - Without spending more public funds? - Mm-hmm. Not another cent. - All right. But, take it easy. Remember what happened to Marie Antoinette. - Eat your cake, darling. Some of the White House rooms look like they've been decorated from a wholesale furniture store during a January clearance. You know, I'm sure Dolly Madison didn't entertain her guests on Naugahyde. I want everything replaced from the rugs to. Oh, what a beautiful bresser chair. Two chairs. Isn't that wonderful? - Yes, Mrs. Kennedy. What a happy day. - Tomorrow we'll go to the National Gallery and see if we can borrow some paintings. - I don't think they lend them out. - Oh, yes they will for the wife of the President. - You're always complaining about the press, Jackie, but the New York Times had this to say about your White House guide. "Mrs. Kennedy should be commended for her creative method "of raising money for the work of renovation. "Removing the burden from the shoulders "of the already overburdened taxpayer". - We've sold out the first printing. - I thought they'd pillory you for commercializing the White House. I was wrong, as usual. They love you to death, Jackie. [laughs] - Daddy. - Well, good morning, buttons. You on your way to school? - Yes. Mommy made it so it's just down the hall. - I know. Your mommy makes a lot of things happen. - And we have a sandbox and a nice teacher. - Do you really? How about a kiss for your old man? How about one for your Uncle Bob? - Have a good day, peanut. - How about one for your mom. - I'll see you later, sweetheart. - See you later. You study hard. - Jack, you have a cabinet meeting in 15 minutes. - Well, they never started without me before. - He's tired. Working late. - Come on, I'll walk you over. - How's Dad? Is group therapy getting anywhere? - Well, they've got him sitting up in a wheelchair now, but he hasn't got his speech back. - Can he understand anything you say? - Yes. Come on, I'll give you his medical status on the way. Ah, I see. Waiting for Dr. Feelgood. - Give me a break, Bob. My back's killing me. - He looks like a butcher. [Jackie laughs] What are in those shots anyway? - Vitamins? I never asked. - You take these? - I haven't yet, but they really seem to help Jack. - I'm gonna check this guy out. - Oh, Bobby. Bobby, don't ruin a good thing. - Yes, I understand. It was nice to see you again. - Good day. - Hi, doc. Thanks for coming by again. Same old thing. You remember my brother, Bob? - Yes, of course. - How are you, Doctor? - Nice to see you. - Tell them not to start without me. - We'll get you fixed up in no time. [knocking on door] - Yes? Mr. Coleman. - Mrs. Kennedy. - They can be shot from there. - Ma'am? - My children. - Shot, ma'am? - From across the street by photographers, by tourists. They follow poor little Caroline around with flashbulbs trying to make her into some gassy little Shirley Temple. I want the Secret Service to do something about it. - Well, maybe we could put some shrubs down there, some trees to block the view. - I'd prefer a brick wall. - With all due respect, we can't put a brick wall around the White House. - Who will be the first president brave enough to build one? [knocking on door] - I'll go see what I can do about those shrubs. - Morning. I'm building up this incredible antipathy to the Secret Service. - What's the problem? - They're always in the way except when you need them. What's all that? - Oh, the usual requests. A delegation from your old school, Ms. Porters, would like to be received. - No. - And a group from Vassar. - Same thing. - Your alma mater? - Has George Balanchine returned my call? - Yes, he said he'd be delighted to come to tea. - Good. I want to pick his brains about getting artists to perform at the White House. - And there are three or four requests for interviews. - No to anything that doesn't have to do with my program for the arts. Now, get Mr. Balanchine on the phone. - Jackie. The meeting with de Gaulle is set for next month in Paris. I'd really you to come along. - And leave the children? - Look, the children will be fine. It's very important. Going on from Paris to Vienna to see Khrushchev. - Are you going to be talking about the nuclear test ban treaty? - Yep. - All right. I'll go. - All you have to do is look ravishing and speak beautiful French. - I'll be fine, but you seem exhausted. Are you sure you have the stamina? - I'm bringing some along for both of us. - Dr. Feelgood? - Himself. See ya. [uplifting music] [people chattering] - Monsieur President. Madam Kennedy. Vive la France. [speaking French] [people chattering] - Hi. - Hi. - You got de Gaulle eating out of your hand. I think he actually smiled once or twice. - I think he's quite charming in a majestic sort of way. - Oh, attracted to him, are you? - Not as attracted as you seem to be to the wife of the whatever that you were dancing with. Dark lady of the finger waves. - Duty dance. - I visited this room after the war when I was studying in France. It was a shambles then and they were restoring it. Look at it now. - And look at you, what you've become. You know, I knew I'd get a great laugh tonight introducing myself as the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris. They only laughed 'cause it's so true. If I'd made this trip alone, I'm not sure the press, or de Gaulle, would've given me the time of day. How's it feel to be a queen? - Jack, not quite. - No? The finest chefs, the best couturieres, the world's most accomplished musicians all play for you. May I? - Why certainly, Mr. President. [elegant music] - Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev said yes to a performance at the state dinner. - What about Casals? - I have a letter here from Abe Fortas. Isn't that his American attorney? - Fortas? Let me see. I've been on pins and needles about this for weeks. Yes, he's coming out of exile to play at the White House. Where's the president? - Exercising in the pool. - He's got to know. Casals is out of exile for one day just to play for us. What a triumph. Give this to the president personally. - Hi, Jim. I've got to see the president. Important message from Mrs. Kennedy. - Sorry, nobody permitted inside. I'll give it to him. - No, I have to deliver it personally. - Sorry, no can do. - Oh, for goodness sake. I have seen the president in the pool a hundred times. - Not quite like this you haven't. - Like what? - You a virgin, ma'am? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Better go back upstairs, sweetheart. We don't want to shock an innocent mind. - Nothing would shock me. - Me, neither. Wow. [elegant music] - Bravo. [applause] - Bravo. Maestro, this is my wife, Jacqueline. - Thank you so much. - That's Munoz Merin. And Mrs. Munoz Merin. It was really marvelous, thank you. - Bravo. - Look, if Governor Barnett tries to keep Mr. Meredith from registering, any federal marshals will arrest Governor Barnett. That's right. Look, Bobby and Walker are on top of this. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it in the morning. Hang on just a second. What's wrong? It was a great party. That was a nice tribute to you from Casals. - The maid found these. Find out who owns them. They're not my size. [door slams] - Kenny, I'll call you right back. I'll call you right back. - Mr. President, because in the history of show business perhaps there is no one female who meant so much, who has done more, Mr. President. - That's quite a birthday celebration they're giving him. - They love him in New York, Mother. [applause] - Mr. President, the great Marilyn Monroe. [applause and cheering] - Oh, I've had enough. - No, let's see the rest of it. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday, Mr. President ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ [applause] Everybody, Happy Birthday. ["Happy Birthday"] - Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. [cheering] - Thank you. I can now retire from politics having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way. [laughing] - Glad the children didn't stay up to see that. When your father acted that way, I didn't put up with it. - What's the message, Mother? Do what you did with Daddy and get a divorce? Clearly I can't, and I won't. - You have to do something. [horns honking] - What a marvelous Dior. I'll take that, too. - You really should buy something by an American designer. - You know, everyone has an opinion on how I should behave, but no one knows what it's like to be First Lady. If I don't take care of myself, I'll go mad. - It's been hard with Jack, hasn't it? - That'll be all, thank you. - Stash and I can't seem to make it work, either. - I'm sorry to hear that. - I've been seeing quite a bit of Ari Onassis. - Really? Have to let him spoil you with those fabulous jewels I hear about and private soirees on his island in Greece. - It's a challenge I can only hope to fail. [people shouting] [engine starts] - Stand back. Stand back. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hi, Mr. President. - No, he's not here right now. Who is this? [laughing] - It's okay, I'll call back. - Wait a minute, Marilyn. Is that you? Are you Marilyn? This is Mrs. Kennedy. - Oh, hi. Look, I'm sorry to disturb you, but he gave me this number and he said to call him anytime. He said it was a private number. - Oh, did he? Well, since I have you on the phone, Marilyn, let me ask you something. What exactly are your intentions toward my husband? - Excuse me, my what? - I mean, do you really want him? Because if you do, and he really wants you, then I'll just step aside. - Gee, Mrs. Kennedy. I really don't know what to. - And then you two can get married and you can live in this damn White House. Well? Are you still there, Marilyn? Because if you're not ready to live in this fishbowl as man and wife, then I suggest you forget all about my husband. [dial tone] - What a bitch. - So, what's the problem? What? - They've got tapes. - Who? What tapes? - Tapes of you and women. Mostly Marilyn. Hours and hours of intimate tapes. - Wait a second, wait a second. You know this for a fact? - It's straight from Hoover. He says the mafia has Lawford's beach house bugged. - Son of a bitch. - Hoover claims they taped at least one session with Marilyn, maybe more. He's been sitting on this like a spider. - Hoover. I should've fired him when I had the chance. Well, that's it. You're gonna have to break it off for me. You're gonna have to get yourself out there, talk to Marilyn, explain to her that this thing has to end. - Shouldn't that come from you? - What are you Emily Post? Of course it should come from me. - Look, I'll take care of it for you, but you have to break it off. - Fine. - We're sitting ducks. - Tell her it's over and it's finished. - Fine. - And far be it from me to give you advice about anything, but she can be very difficult to resist when she wants to be. - I know. - I had a feeling you did. Be careful. Let's talk about something less complicated. What do you want to do about Mr. Castro? - Hi, Peter. It's me. No, I'm not going to be coming over tonight. Can you come over? No, Bobby just left. You know, we had a pretty bad fight and don't really feel like being alone. He lied to me, Peter. He's just using me. He's like his brother. [crying] He changed his, he changed his number. I had to tell him I was calling a press conference just to get him to talk to me. What? No, just forget that. Just listen to me. He comes over here and he tells me that I'm crazy. He never loved me, Peter. Jack never loved me. Nobody ever loved me. They just pass me around. Peter, they pass me around. Oh, God. They waited until I was down to kick me. The Kennedy brothers kissed me off. Peter, am I getting all of it? No. Love me for my yellow hair. Huh? Nothing. Hey, sweetie. Say goodbye to Pat for me, okay? Say goodbye to the press. [laughs] [people chattering] - Here they come. - Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Kennedy has a statement for you. - Good morning. I've been asked to make a comment on the tragic death of Marilyn Monroe. All I can say at this sad time is she will go on eternally. [people shouting] - Please. Please, please. That's absolutely all that Mrs. Kennedy has to say. Thank you. [people chattering] - Hi. It's been over for months. It was. - What? - Let's just go to sleep. - I'd like to be alone tonight. [door shuts] [tense music] [knocking on door] - I only have a minute. My secretary said you wanted to see me. - King Hasaan's state visit. First, a performance by the New York City Light Opera, then a reception with Alan Jay Lerner, Samuel Barber, Sol Hurok, Myrna Loy, Agnes de Mille among others. How does that sound? - You didn't get me over here to discuss a guest list. - No. I'm pregnant. - Congratulations. That's great. What's the matter? - I'm afraid to hope again, Bobby. - I'm sure it will be a healthy pregnancy. - No. I'm afraid to hope about Jack. That things will ever be different. - My brother will always be my brother. - I know. I've even come to accept his behavior in a certain way, but despite all that, I do so hope this baby will bring us together. - I hope so, too. - Cardiology, please call the nurse's station in ward six. Cardiology, please call the nurse's station in ward six. - He's beautiful. I saw him. Never seen anything like this before. I was never actually there when any of my children were born. He's so tiny. - A little over four pounds. - And struggling like hell to live. What are his chances? - His respiratory system is severely underdeveloped. If he can get through the next few days, he has a chance. - That's my son. Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. [wistful music] [priest saying prayer] - I was thinking. - Yes? - Nothing. - Can you sleep? - What about you? - I don't even try. - Why don't you? - What? - Take something to sleep. - I don't care anymore. - Oh. - He's been so difficult these days. - Why don't you take a break? - Thank you. - Come on, Joe. You've gotta eat something. For me, please? Joe, you want applesauce up your nose? That's better. We understand each other, don't we? Both tough guys, right, Joe? You know, I remember the first time I came here and we talked out there and ate nine years ago. I was so scared of you that day. And you said something about the Kennedy's are winners, you said. And they marry winners. And you thought I was a winner. I don't feel much like a winner. God, Joe. I miss you so much. I miss your energy and your vision. You were always so good at fixing things. Can't you tell me what to do? [dishes clinking] ♪ Joe, Joe, from Kokomo ♪ ♪ Just got back from the Vaudeville show ♪ My father used to sing that to me. ♪ Joe, Joe, from Kokomo ♪ ♪ Just got back from the Vaudeville show ♪ You know, I never heard Jack sing. Isn't that strange? I never heard him sing. But, he'll be here soon and then we'll all sing. You, me, Rose, Jack, all the children. We'll all sing. He's very busy, Jack. You understand that, don't you? He's very busy. But, he'll be here soon and we'll all sing together. ♪ Joe, Joe, from Kokomo ♪ ♪ Just got back from the Vaudeville show ♪ Now, keep your head down and your eye on the ball. - I'm not interested in golf. - Well, all girls need to learn how to play golf. - Mommy, you know that doll with the yellow dress? Well, one of her arms came off. - I don't care about the doll, Caroline. I want to see you practice. Now please. - You never let me do anything. I don't want to talk to you. - That's enough out of you, young lady. You behave yourself. - I want Maude. I don't want you. - Then, go to Maude. - Share, dear. Aw. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Overseas telephone call for Mrs. Kennedy. - It's Lee. - Hello, Lee. Where are you? - Somewhere off the coast of Italy. Can you hear me? I'm with Ari on his yacht. He wants to give it to us. - Give it to us? - Lend it to us for our own private cruise. He knows you've been feeling blue after the baby. - What, like Santa Claus? - He knows you need a vacation. He's even promised to stay on shore to protect our reputations. He really is a sweetheart. - I think we're a little old to worry about our reputations. - Aristotle Onassis is a crook. - Who says so? - He cheated the American public out of 20 million dollars on a US Maritime commission deal and then he paid a 7 million dollar fine to avoid prosecution. - Well, you might as well get used to him because he's going to marry my sister. - Not until after the 1964 election. I've already discussed that with her. - You've got a lot of nerve telling my sister what to do. - Damn it, Jackie. There's a lot at stake here besides your little cruise. The American public doesn't want to see the wife of the president sailing around the Mediterranean with some damn Greek shipowner. - It will be very discrete. Jack. I need to get away. I really want to go. Please. - You'll have to take some kind of chaperone. It won't look right. I'll ask F.D.R. Jr and Susanne. - Fine. [serene music] - Let me ask you this. How is it that I, the son of a poor person, am sitting between two of the most beautiful, and exciting, women in the world? - Because you're rich, Ari. - No, no, no, no, no. No, there are men who are richer than I. And do not tell me it is because I look like Adonis. No, there is more to it than that. Can you give me the answer, Mrs. Kennedy? - Maybe it's because you ask the right questions. - Oh, wonderful. Yeah, wonderful. Exactly. One must ask the right questions. The rest is simple. [laughs] More champagne. I want us to have the most amusing time. I want that very much. - Lee, are you going to marry him? - Well, number one, he hasn't asked me. Number two, I'm still married to Stash. And number three, he's still got Maria Callas on his mind. I find him very. - Hello, Jackie. [speaking Italian] - Get her back here. - Evelyn? Evelyn? Send a telegram to Mrs. Kennedy aboard the yacht Christina. Dear Jackie, get your ass back home. - Or words to that effect. - My island is rough and crude just like me. You'll come and stay with me one day. You and the president. - I doubt it. - But, you enjoyed yourself. - Yes. It's just what I needed. Oh, I wish it didn't have to end. - It doesn't have to end. - Of course it does. It's been so wonderful. The islands, the dancing. And you've been so sweet to me. It's been lovely getting to know you, Ari. - A little going away present. [laughs] - Oh, Ari. Oh, it's so beautiful. - Here. I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you wearing it again soon. - I don't know what to say. - We can't win in 64 without Texas. - They spit on Adlai Stevenson in Dallas, didn't they? - They're a bunch of crazies down there, Jack. - They've always hated Adlai in Texas, but they like Jack a little. - The problem is Governor Connally and Senator Yarborough are at each other's throats. They're going to split the Texas Democratic Party. - Why can't Lyndon wash his own damn laundry? - We need a peacemaker down there. - Jackie? You with us? - Do I have a choice? - You were brilliant with de Gaulle, you were even better with Khrushchev. You can certainly handle Connally and Yarborough. - The tour will be San Antonio, Houston, then a motorcade from the airport, and a big speech in Dallas. - I'll make sure the Secret Service puts the bubble top on the car. - No bubble top. Kenny, Bobby. [subdued music] What is it? It's Patrick, isn't it? - Oh, Jack. I love you. - I love you. - He brought us together, didn't he? Nothing matters except our family. - Look, you don't have to go to Dallas. Stay here with the children. - I'll campaign with you wherever you want if it means being together. - We will be. I promise. [soft music] [dramatic music] - Can't we go to Texas with you? - Not this time, sweetheart. Won't be any fun. Just a lot of boring grown up speeches. - I want Mommy. - Daddy and I will be back very soon, and then you can go to the country and ride your pony. - Don't forget my birthday. - We'll be back in plenty of time for both your birthdays. Now, gimme a big hug. Bye bye, sweetheart. - Bye. - Bye bye, John John. [helicopter rumbling] [background noise drowns out dialogue] [background noise drowns out dialogue] - Clear! [helicopter rumbling] [lively music] - Right on time. [audience cheering] - Hi, Miss Kennedy. - Don't cover yourself up, people wanna see you. - Over here! Over here, Jackie! [gun firing] - Oh Jack. Oh God, oh God they killed Jack. They killed my husband. - Mrs. Kennedy! Mrs. Kennedy, get back in the car! Please, Mrs. Kennedy! Get her back in the car! - Has been hit. Repeat, has been hit. Lady's okay. We're heading for Parkland Falls. Repeat, we're heading for Parkland Falls. [siren wailing] [sobbing] We're in Parkland now. Over and out. [tires screeching] - Mr. President. - Please, please. - Mrs. Kennedy. Please. We've got to get the president inside to a doctor right now. Let's go. - All right, let us in there. - We're outta here. - Grab his legs, grab his legs. Okay, I got 'im. - Okay. - You gotta let me have him, you've gotta let me have him. - Hey, let's move. - Watch his neck. Careful, hold him steady. - Get his upper arm up. - Let's go, let's go. [background noise drowns out dialogue] - You can't come in here. - Cut those clothes off, cut 'em off right now! - Sir! - Please, please. - Oh my God. Jackie, my God. Oh, we've got to get you out of these clothes. - I want the world to see what they've done to Jackie. - Please. - Mrs. Kennedy, is there anything I can do for you? Would you like a sedative? - I don't want a sedative. I want to be with my husband when he dies. - I need normal saline and plasma lyte. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Kennedy, you can't come in here. - Try and stop me! - Please, please! - We'll take her in. - Two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. - Watch that respirator. - It's on the way. - I can't get a pressure. - One, two, three... - What do we got on the monitor? - He's fine. - One, two, three... - No pulse. - Pupils bilaterally fixed and dilated. - Put these in right now. [steady beep] - Mrs. Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy. Your husband has sustained a fatal wound. [somber music] - Ken, I'm gonna have to make some sort of announcement to the press. - Ask the president. - The president? - Johnson. Ask President Johnson. [somber music] What are they doing? - They have to perform the autopsy. - Not here. - It's the state law. Murder was committed in Texas, the autopsy has to be in Texas. - Nope, we're taking him back to Washington. Let's go, right now. Let's go. - Excuse me. - Out of our way please. - Step aside. - Mr. President, I have to announce President Kennedy's death. - I don't know what in the hell's goin' on here. What kind of communist conspiracy this might be. I mean, we don't know if they could be after me, the speaker, Secretary of State. I think I better get out of here. Then, you can make your announcement. Let's go. - Hold it, guys. The Dallas County medical examiner's on his way. - We're leaving. [dramatic music] [sobbing] - President Johnson wants the captain to kill the engines. The judge is here. He wants to be sworn in before we leave the ground. - For God's sake, why? He's automatically the President now. - But look, we don't know who the hell... We don't know who the hell's behind this thing. We could be under attack by a foreign power and shot if we take off, okay? He doesn't want the country left without a president, okay. And he wants Mrs. Kennedy there for the swearing in. - Mrs. Kennedy, the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, is about to take the oath of office. He would very much like for you to be present. Look, you don't have to do this. - It's all right. I owe the country that much. [somber music] - Judge. Let's get this done. - Very well. I do solemnly swear. - I do solemnly swear. - That I will faithfully execute. - That I will faithfully execute. - The office of President of the United States. - The office of President of the United States. - And will to the best of my ability. - And will to the best of my ability. - Preserve. - Preserve. - Protect. - Protect. - And defend. - And defend. - The constitution of the United States. - The constitution of the United States. - So help me God. - So help me God. - Come on, back it up. Back it up. - Bobby, how's it... - All right, there, back it in now. Watch it. [dramatic music] - Mrs. Kennedy. - Mother. Where are the children? - At the White House. - I've been trying to find out. Have they been told? - We were afraid they'd hear on the television, so I had Mrs. Shaw tell them. I don't think John understood, but, poor little Caroline cried and cried. - I have to see them. - They're asleep. Better wait until morning. - All right. I'll stay with Jack. [somber music] [somber music] Up you go. That's it, good boy. Caroline. Come close to Mommy. I have something very, very sad to tell you. - We know. Daddy's dead. - Yes. Daddy's gone to heaven. God wanted Daddy so much that he called him to heaven so he could be with God. - But I want Daddy here. - I know, sweetheart. We all do. But you see, God wanted Daddy too, and it was in God's hands, so... Let's write a letter to Daddy, shall we? - Yes. - Yes, come on. Write a letter, and you can say anything you want. What's this? - It's the letter I made. - It's the letter you made? Dear Daddy, we are all going to miss you. I love you very much, Daddy. Caroline. Thank you, Doctor. Maybe I'll sleep. Thank you for coming to stay with me, Lee. - If you or the children need anything, I'm here. - I know. [somber music] My darling Jack, I still can't believe that you are not going to be lying beside me tonight. Caroline and John John are being ever so brave. And when I look at them, and I think about Patrick who lived such a short time, and who I wanted so much to be part of us forever. We had such beautiful plans and dreams. I would give anything just to be in this room with you. All of us together. Is that so much? Oh, that's a good boy. That's a good boy. There you go. This is your father's bed. And I want you to sleep here tonight, because we'll be leaving here soon, and I want you to always remember who your father was. I want you to remember that one night you slept in the bed he slept in when he was President of the United States. Jack. Oh my God, Jack. Jack. [sobbing] Jack. Oh Jack. I would like an eternal flame, a light that is never extinguished. The funeral will be at St. Matthew's. Jack will be carried in the same caisson that brought Franklin Delano Roosevelt to his grave. - Why don't you let the staff take care of the details? - Because I want this funeral to remind the American people of what they have lost. I want muffled drum rolls all the way. And when we are received by Cardinal Cushing, I will kiss his ring. - Lee Harvey Oswald died at Parkland hospital a little after one o'clock. - One more awful thing. - It's gonna make it harder to find out who was really behind this. - What difference does it make? Will it bring Jack back? [dramatic music] - There was the sound of laughter, and in a moment it was no more, and so she took a ring from her finger, and placed it in his hands. There was a wit in a man neither young nor old, but a wit full of an old man's wisdom and of a child's wisdom, and then, in a moment it was no more. And so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands. There was a man marked with the scars of his love of country, a body active with the surge of a life far, far from spent and, in a moment, it was no more. And so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands. There was a father with a little boy, and a little girl and the joy of each in the other. And in a moment it was no more, and so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands. There was a husband who asked much and gave much, and out of the giving and the asking wove with a woman what could not be broken in life, and in a moment it was no more. And so she took a ring from her finger and placed it in his hands, and kissed him and closed the lid of the coffin. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] - Where do you want these? - Oh, I don't know. Just put them in there. [phone ringing] - Mrs. Kennedy's residence. Surely, one moment. It's President Johnson. - All right. - She'll receive the call. - Yes, this is Mrs. Kennedy. Hello Lyndon. Fine, thank you. How are you? Yes, we've almost moved in. The children are fine. Thank you for asking. No, I think it's too soon. It's just too soon. Another time. Give my regards to Lady Bird. Goodbye. - What does he want now? - Sweetheart, listen. Lady Bird and I wanna see you over here at our next White House dinner party. Jack Kennedy was a great man, but ya'll gotta start livin' again. - How dare that oversized cow punching oaf call me sweetheart. - He wants you on his side. Your support will be a political coup. - Jack brought such a special grace to the White House. These people are crude. I'll tell you, it'll be a long time before I accept an invitation from Colonel Cornpone and his little pork chop. - On your right, ladies and gentlemen, you'll see the new residence of President Kennedy's widow. Mrs. Kennedy and her two children have lived here in Georgetown since leaving the White House. There's always a crowd. After all, who wouldn't wanna watch the comings and goings of the most famous woman in the world. - Besides, I can't face it outside. They're everywhere. They're like locusts. - There's Mommy. Ready for school. - Are you warm enough, Caroline? - Yes. - Yes, okay, time to go. John John, button up your coat, sweetheart. That's a good boy. It's cold outside. Okay, let's go. Bye bye. Bye sweetie. [smooches] See you later. Bye. - Oh, it's the children! - Please. - Oh, my little darling! - Ma'am, please let go of her. Let go of... - Oh my God, no. They're attacking my children. - No, Mrs. Kennedy. No, please, you'll cause a riot. The secret service take care of it. Now look, see, they're arresting her already. The children are all right. - Why don't you leave us alone? Why can't they leave us alone? [laughing] - Over here! - Must be strange for you to be here in the first house you owned with Jack. - Yes, but I'm glad you bought it and kept it in the family. - Hey, how about gettin' in the ball game? - Football was never my sport. The dead prefers ballet to baseball. - Who said that? Me? - Yes, that's what you said the first time we met in Hyannis Port. - Well, I always did have a big mouth. Hey, if you need anything, give a yell. - Thanks Ethel. - I got it! I got it. - Hey, come here boy! - Let me down. - Oh, you want down, huh? Like on your head? - I'm glad you came today. I know how hard it is for you. - And you. All the bright light is gone from the world. - Jackie. - I try. I do, I try. Just like you were trying out there in the field. And maybe it seems like we're playing the game and there's no meaning. - I'm thinking about leaving the administration. - What? - I'm no good to anybody here. Can't eat, can't sleep, can't work. Go to the capital everyday. Memories. - I know. - Johnson and his cronies are trying to take credit for what Jack did. I don't wanna stick around and see that happen. Besides, Lyndon can't stand me nor I him. - Don't quit on us, Bobby. - I didn't say I was quitting. - You're giving up, I can feel it. But you and I can't afford to do that because of the children. John John needs a strong father figure. - I'll be there for John John. I'm just not sure about the rest right now. - You know Jack would have wanted us to carry on. Me with the children, you with continuing to serve. - You know what Jack would have said? - What would he have said? - Something unprintable. - Will you think about it? - Sure. I love you, kid. - I love you too. [dramatic music] [dog barking] [sobbing] [crying] [crickets chirping] - This is Congressman Jack Kennedy. - Hi. - Congressman. - Now, you've met before, haven't you? - Yes, I think so. - I don't think so. [laughing] - I'd remember. - You're licking your fingers, and you're very sexy. Descent, sit, descent and, sit and sit and... [cheering] Yes! The winners! - So this is you grubby politicians operate. Grab what you can get, huh? - I don't grab just anything at all. I only go after the best. [gentle music] [crickets chirping] [dog barking] - Jackie. Jackie, right here! Jackie. - What? [ominous music] [horn honking] - Wow, look at this. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Central Park. You've outdone yourself, Jackie. Can you afford it? - No. But Andre Meyer said it's a great investment. - He should know. - And I'd have paid anything to get out of Washington. - Don't kid yourself. The cab driver knew you lived here. - Well, it's better than being another stop on the guided tour. At least the children and I can walk down the streets without being mobbed. [sighs] Sometimes I wished I could just say the hell with all of them. - Why don't you? Let's go to lunch and test this new theory. I'll bet we don't get five feet. - I'd love to, Lee. But actually, I'm having lunch with Andre. He's been enormously helpful raising money for the Kennedy library. - Yes, right, I know. You've been extremely devoted to the exhibition of Jack's presidential effects. - Jack deserves to have his place in history. - Jack has his place in history. What about your life? I miss you. - I'm late. Enjoy the view. Harvard has backed out. Now, we found another site for the library at Columbia point, but it'll cost a great deal more than the committee plan. - Jackie, calm down. We will find the money. You can put me down for a quarter of a million. - Andre, you're an angel, but I'll need more than that. Now, how much can I contribute personally? - As you suggested, I reviewed your financial situation. Jack Kennedy, God bless him, did not leave you a rich woman. - Well, what is my situation exactly? - If the Kennedy family did not pay most of your bills, you could not afford to live the way you do. After your fixed expenses, what's left? It may not give you more than one or two shopping expeditions on Madison Avenue. - Andre, can't you take what's mine and make me rich? - Frankly, Jackie, you don't have the money to make the money to make you rich. - So much for me making major contribution. - Now, don't fret. I've always looked after your interests. I think I have someone who can build you a library for you. - Who? - An old friend of your sisters. Aristoteles Onassis. In fact, I've already contacted his office... - No, Andre, I couldn't go to Ari. It's a wonderful idea, but I just couldn't do that. - But he's one of the richest men in the world. - Yes, but this is one project I don't want to call on friends for. I'll write him a note and thank him for his thoughtfulness. - He must be quite a special friend. - He's been very kind to my family. Hello, sweetheart! [smooches] Gosh, I missed you today. - Me too, Mommy. - I got some pretzels. Shall we go to the park? - Great, now I can show you... - Kennedy! Your father's dead! He got shot! - Your father's dead, your father's dead! Your father's dead... - Can you boys... Do you know those boys? - They're in my new school. - This is outrageous. I'm gonna get their names and go right to the head of school. - Can't we go home? Please. - Mrs. Kennedy. - Just leave it. - Yes, ma'am. [dramatic music] - Thank you, Lawrence. Does this kind of thing happen everyday? - Sometimes. Once I had to punch one of them in the nose. - You did? - I don't even remember my Dad. Why don't they like him? - Surprise! - A car! - Where did you get that? - It just came today. - Is this for me? - Yes it is, John, and there's even something for you, Mommy. It's out on the hall table. Yippe! - Vroom, vroom! - Giddy up. Yee-haw, giddy up. Faster. - My dear Jackie, I am please that you consider me enough of a friend not to ask for a contribution to the John F. Kennedy memorial library. Instead, I warm wishes to you and your children. I will be in New York at the end of the month and hope to see you there. Aristoteles Onassis. [uplifting music] You are looking better than the last time I saw you. And you've been getting out. - Not very much. - Oh, come now. I must have read you have a dozen males you keep dangling from your fingers like marionettes. - Don't believe everything you read, Ari. You should know that. - Well, it's the truth then. - I need escorts to certain events. That's what they are. Escorts. [laughing] - Isn't it interesting. I'm sure that each one of those helpless suitors believes that he alone holds the secret to the heart of Jacqueline Kennedy. - You know I adore you, Ari. But we're just having dinner together. - You like Greek food? - Mm-hmm, love it. - Good. Then for your just dinner, I'm gonna take you to the best Greek restaurant in New York. - This is the best Greek restaurant in New York? - Wait 'til you taste the soupa avgolemono. A restaurant is only as good as its chicken broth. Don't you agree? - Well, Ari, if this place is so wonderful, where are all the customers? - Oh them. I bought the whole place out. Come. - What are you putting in there? Cinnamon? - Yes, for the [speaks Greek] [laughs] That's sort of a Greek pot roast. Awe, I love simple foods best. Good bread, good wine. When I taste such things, I do not know whether I am a peasant or a king, yeah. - Absolutely noble. [laughing] [gentle uplifting music] - Now we have some color in your cheeks. - It was the wine. - And the company to her home. - Yes, Ari, and the company. - Another question is what are we gonna do about your sister. - What about my sister? - Well, as far as I'm concerned, she is a dear and lovely friend. But you... You are the most desirable woman in the world. - I don't think Lee expects anymore from your relationship. - And you're having a good time? - I always have a good time with you. When Lee and I took that cruise through the Greek islands after Patrick died, you were so kind. - Oh, it's the very least I could do. - And after Jack's funeral, during that terrible year, you were one of the few people who understood or cared what I was going through. - Maybe we Greeks have an instinct for tragedy. [laughing] - Oh God, I hope not. - I've come a long, long way in my life. Tragedy. Comedy, comedy tragedy. After a while, one no longer even finds it necessary to make the distinction. It's all life, Jacqueline. Life. To be lived. Even Jacqueline Kennedy has the right to live. On her own, as she pleases. Deep down you don't really believe that, do you? But you will. - Oh yeah, and yesterday during recess, she started doing cartwheels to impress the boys. And her dress blew up right in front of them. - Caroline dear! Caroline, dear, they're lying to you when they say that President Kennedy is dead. I have secret information that your father is still alive. - Ma'am, kindly cross the street please. All right, ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand over here. - They tried to bury him. Let go! - I'm gonna ask you to stand over here. - They didn't bury him. He jumped out of the grave, just like Jesus Christ, they tried to bury him, but he jumped out of the grave. Just like Jesus Christ! Let go of me! I saw him in Central Park. I'll show you where he is. - With LBJ out of the running, I think I can get the nomination. - That's great, Bobby. - I could use your help. - I was there for the party in '64. I'll certainly be there for you in '68. - You sure you want to? I'm not the most popular man out there right now. - Are you sure you want to be president? Caroline was accosted on the street again today. It was very scary, wasn't it, sweetheart? - Where was the secret service? - Oh, they were right there, just as they were when Jack... - Caroline, do you want me to tell you a bedtime story? Got a good one about a magic flying horse. - You go onto bed, sweetheart. I'll be up in a minute. - Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight? - Of course. I'll stay as long as you need me. Off you go. You tell me, is it worth it? - I can't live my life in fear. I think I can make a difference. - Then you have my support. - How serious is it between you and Aristoteles Onassis? - More than substantial. Less than serious. - He's a real family weakness. First your sister and now you. - He cares about me. - And you think his money can protect you and the children from the kind of thing that happened today? - I won't have the Kennedy family dictating who I see. - Jack always felt that Onassis was a political liability, and right now I couldn't agree more. He's a crook, a foreigner, he's divorced. - Would it change your mind to know that Ari is planning on making a sizeable contribution to your campaign? - That would be greatly appreciated. - So your father isn't the only man in the world who can buy what he wants. - Jackie, I don't wanna demean your relationship with Onassis, but you... - Well, let's just put it in terms the Kennedys can understand. Caroline is waiting. - Can't we take the boat out and catch some little fish? - I've never caught a little fish before. What bait do you use? - Worms. - Worms? Where do we get worms? - What do they talk about? - I have no idea. - They always talk. - I hate the way he chases you. We didn't even invite him here. - It's a free country. - The way he comes loaded down with presents for the children. It's vulgar. - He's a vulgar man. - Do you know where to buy worms? - Sure. - Yeah. [laughs] Go buy some worms. - Vulgar in appearance and manner. The women he's been involved with. Evita Peron and his current flame, that opera singer. Maria Callas. [chuckles] - Mother, I'm trying to read. - Oh, is that a polite way of saying it's none of my business? - Yes, mother. I'm trying to be polite. - Where are the worms? - The man said this is a hundred dollars. - Oh. I see. Here's another hundred dollars. Maybe this is enough, huh. [chuckles] - You gave John 200 dollars for worms? - I never bought worms before. Anchors, diamonds, yachts. No experience with worms. - The man couldn't change such a large bill. - Well, anyway, I've caught something. - And John didn't know what to think. He was embarrassed. You spoil my children. - I like your children. And if you think I am excessive, it is only because they have no vitality in their lives. When John is frightened of things, and, well, at times when Caroline seems so sad. - Everyone's an expert on other people's children. - Oh. Do I offend you? - No. I suppose you're right. - Well, when you come to Skorpios and meet my children, I will lie at your feet and receive your expert advice. But only if we are in an olive grove, and after a bottle of good red wine. And only if we are both wearing no clothes. [giggling] - Ari, you are in incorrigible. - Oh, no no. I mean, could you imagine such a family. - With no clothes? - No, I mean your children and mine on a peaceful island in the middle of the blue union city. Is that not a dream worth dreaming? [uplifting gentle music] - And the best part is that no one knows I'm here, not even the Kennedy family. - I thought they knew everything. - If they knew I were here with you during the California primary, they'd send down a hit man. - A hit man? - Mm-hmm. - Whoa ho ho. Oh no. - Haven't you heard of the Irish mafia? The Murphy O'Shea. - So how does it feel to be safe from all that? No crazies on the street. No reporters, no photographers, no family responsibilities. - It feels like heaven. - Then why not make it last? I'm ready to get married again. How about you? - You mean in general? Or did you have someone specific in mind? - Jacqueline, please. Do not tease me at this most momentous moment in my life. - Every moment for you is momentous, Ari. That's what's so wonderful. But you know I'm still seeing other men. Roswell Gilpatric, for example, is a very dear friend. - Jacqueline, I am serious now. - All right. I promised the family we will wait to make a decision until after the election. [chuckling] - They really think I am a bad guy. - Bad for their image. - Maybe I should be flattered they think I have so much power in America. But they do not know about the power of love. I've used the wrong word? - This is Ike Pappas reporting from Los Angeles. At this hour, it appears that Senator Kennedy has taken an insurmountable lead over his opponents in the primary, and is about to capture all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July, which means... - Is Uncle Bobby going to be president, Mom? - It seems as though he has a good chance. - Just like Daddy. - That's right. - We're waiting for the arrival of Senator Kennedy here at his campaign headquarters at the Ambassador Hotel. He will come to give his victory speech, and believe me, it's going to be quite an event. A lot of cheers, a lot of joy. It appears as if Robert Kennedy is on his way. - Is there enough room for all of our cousins to live in the white house? - I'm sure they'll work something out. [phone ringing] Hello? Is this the service? I thought I told you to hold all calls. Who? All right. Hello Chuck. Yes, I know Bobby won the primary. What? Oh my God. [somber music] - Ladies and gentlemen, step this way. - We were coming through the doors after the speech, into some sort of kitchen in the hotel when this guy shot... They say he wanted revenge. I don't understand why. Something about the six day war. What's that got to do with Bobby? - Nothing, nothing. - But you know, you've been there. - I don't know anything. - Oh God, what am I gonna do about the children? What am I gonna do? - We'll all be there, we'll take care of the children. - There's a priest somewhere. I don't know where he went. - I'll find him. - No no, don't go. Please, please please don't go. - He can help you more than I can. If there's one thing the Catholic church is good at it's death. I'll be right back. [sobbing] [phone ringing] - Lee. - It's so awful, I can't even say. Stos and I flew in direct from London. - Hold me. - You're shaking. - I hate what's happening to this country. - You don't know what you're saying. - Yes, I do. I don't wanna live here anymore. If they're killing Kennedys, my children are number one targets. I'm getting out of this country, Lee. Just as soon as I can. [seagulls calling] - Shall we get down to business. - Oh, why not? - I'm off to Athens. - How long will you be gone? - Two days. You think that's enough time to visit all the shops? - Well, if it isn't, you will go back. Enjoy yourself. - I will. Goodbye Teddy. - Goodbye. - Get some sun. - Now, Senator. - We love Jackie. Want her to have a happy and secure future. - Oh, so do I. - However, if she remarries, she'll lose her income from the Kennedy trust. - Senator Kennedy, I'm aware of the amount of that income, and it surprises me. Now, I hope this does not offend you, but it does surprise me that one of the wealthiest families in America should place a well-loved member on such a limited budget. - But she also receives a widow's pension from the United States government. - Oh, I see. - And the protection of the secret service. - Senator Kennedy, I will assume full responsibility of all of Jacqueline's lost income. Plus, I will expand my security forces to ensure her complete safety. She'll get whatever she wants and needs. - The family would also like a substantial cash payment to be deposited in her bank account or invested in bonds. - Yes, I am aware of the figure you have in mind, Senator. I'm afraid that is a trifle ambitious. Now, I will deposit exactly one third of that amount. My attorneys have drawn a letter of agreement which I'm sure you will find most satisfactory. Now, why don't you go on and have a swim. I've invited some very interesting local girls. They are on the forward deck. - Thank you, Mr. Onassis. I hope that you and my sister-in-law will be very happy. - So it seems like father's acquired a new stepmother for us. [applauding] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - So, I guess by now everybody's heard that Jackie Kennedy married Aristoteles Onassis. [audience booing] Yeah, yeah. One of the richest men in the world. Have you seen this guy? I mean, come on, tell the truth. Would you sleep with him? [audience booing] Hey, come on. Hey, do you believe she does? - No! - No, but wait she's gotta do something, right? - I don't think they should be allowed to do that sort of thing. - And the newspapers are having a field day. Can you imagine one of them said, "Jack Kennedy dies a second time." - English paper. What was it? Jackie weds blank check. - Italian Paper Observatory said, "This woman is a public sinner." - Janet. - I didn't say it, Hugh. They did. She can't say her mother didn't warn her. - Poor Jackie. - Come on. Come on in. - I'm too comfortable. - You are lazy, you a lazy devil. - Go away, leave me alone. - I'm coming to get you. [laughing] Come on. Come on, come on. Come. Move back. Move back a hundred yards. I am a lucky man. But you are lucky too. With me, you have learned to open up like a flower. Oh, my beautiful flower. [laughing] [gentle music] - I'll take this and the earrings. Perhaps something else. I'll take this too. [speaking in foreign language] Charge it, please, to Aristoteles Onassis. Thank you. I love this, and I want in every color. Charge them and send them to Onassis. - Thank you. [gentle music] - So. - Just a moment. - Ah. Now we will see how good a Greek my wife has become. - Calamari. [laughing] Feto. Oregano. - Yeah. - Paradiso stuffed calamari. [crowd cheering] - Now this, this is the real test. - Ari, I'm not hungry anymore. - Oh no. Eat, these are my friends. You'll insult them if you do not eat. - Go ahead, Jackie, taste some. - Very very good. [speaking in foreign language] - Come on, Jackie. Try it, try it. - Well? - Don't know. - Guess. - Ari, I don't know. [laughing] - Shall I tell her? - Tell her, Ari. Tell her. - Pass the salt. - Splina. [speaking in foreign language] In English, spleen. - Spleen? - Stuffed spleen. You know what spleen is? - Yes. Do you? - Of course, it's down here. [laughing] To be really Greek, to have to eat splina... [speaking in foreign language] Yeah. Eat, Jackie. Eat. - No. - Then... Take it. [crowd cheering] [speaking in foreign language] With me she's never thin this woman. Everything. [cheering] [dramatic music] - Christina, have you seen your father? - He's gone. - What do you mean gone? - Left by boat this morning. - Did he say where? - Paris, probably. I think he misses the opera. - I see. And I shall go to New York. Why don't you come along? - What for? - We can go shopping. Anthony will do your hair. - Don't try and make into some vapid American fashion model. I'm the daughter of a billionaire. I know very well how to spend money. And I'll tell you something. My father won't tolerate your attempts to humiliate him by throwing his money away. - That's enough. - Do you know why he married you? Just to prove to Stavros Niarchos that he could have the most desirable woman in the world. They've been rivals for years in the shipping business. You're just another supertanker, Jackie. [dramatic music] [siren wailing] - Mommy! - Hello. - Look what Ari bought for us. - Ooh. Are these real boats? - A sailboat for Caroline and a speedboat for John. - Why don't you both go to the park with Mrs. Shaw? It's a beautiful day. - All right. Thanks again! - Awe, anything for my Carolina. And my big boy. My John. - Bye. - Bye Mommy. - Bye bye, Mommy. - Bye bye. - Guess what? Ari bought me a sailboat. - And me a boat too. They're so big. - I wish you'd call instead of just showing up. - I never know my schedule. - You can't stay here. - Why not? - I'm redecorating your wing. - I'll only be here a few days, and I go back to Paris. Come with me. - I can't. I have to be in Washington. It's going to be a presentation of our official portraits at the White House. - How portraits? - Portraits of Jack and me. - Well, at least we can have dinner together. - Unfortunately, I have made other plans. - Break them. - I don't think so. - This is not a marriage. - You're right. In a marriage, the husband respects the wife enough not to show her off in public like a paramour. - When did I ever do that? - And he doesn't fly off to Paris to see his mistress whenever he damn well feels like it. - That is vulgar! - It's all vulgar! Please. Don't buy expensive and dangerous gifts for my children. - I'll be at The Pierre until Thursday. - That's nice to know. I usually have to call your secretary to find out where my husband is. - I'm always there for you. - Good night, Ari. [dramatic music] Thank you for being so patient, Mother. - It's always an experience, Jacqueline. [laughing] - So, I'll take the Valentinos. All of them. And the accessories. Send them to my fifth avenue address, and charge it to Onassis. - Certainly. - That'll be all. Ari doesn't care. - Don't you? - Why should I? He's intolerable. He doesn't sleep, he makes business calls 'til three in the morning, or else he's off to some gaudy disco. He can't stand the ballet or the theater or anything I like. And he despises horses. - But he comes out to your place in New Jersey. - Yes, he comes to watch the children. - Right. He seems to care about them. He does. John's formed a deep a attachment. So the problem's between you two. - Culturally, we have nothing in common. - But you plan to stay married? - It's a suitable arrangement. - That makes me sad to hear you say that, Jacqueline. - It works both ways, mother. You know, he used to give me a little gift everyday. A string of pearls, an antique handkerchief. Well, that stopped. Now he's always off to Paris to see the real love of his life. - Why didn't you try to work it out? - Work it out? - I know he can be corse, but he has a decent heart. We don't get that many chances in life, Jacqueline. I wouldn't throw this one away. - I'm glad to see that you're in a better mood than you've been for the last few months. - Why don't we just relax and enjoy each other? - That would be my pleasure. You know, it gets lonely when your wife is constantly on the other side of the world. I go to New York, you go to London, and I go to Greece, you go back to New York. - Well, I'm here now, aren't I? - Yes. Yes, and I do appreciate the effort. - Telephone, Mr. Onassis. - Yes. Yes, Christine. What's the matter? No, no, calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down and tell me. When? [ominous music] Is he all right? Yes. Yes, of course. I leave ear... Right away. - Ari, what is it? - Something's not good. It's my son. His plane... He crashed... [sobs] But he's alive. - Ari, I'm so sorry. - Christina said the only way I could identify him was by a monogram on a handkerchief. [sobbing] In his pockets. What are you doing? - I'm calling the best neurosurgeon in Boston. - I see. - Now, there's an excellent brain specialist in Britain gonna fly down immediately. Don't worry, Ari. I'll take care of everything. We'll be on a plane out of here by midnight. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [birds squawking] [gentle music] - Planes do not just fall out of the sky. It was me they were after. They wanted to get at me by killing my son. I will offer a million dollars reward to anyone who can prove it was sabotage. - I think the crash was an accident. It was an act of God. - No, it was a plot against me! Don't you understand? - I know. - You don't know. And you do not care either. - That's not true. - Would you accept the murder of my son just as you accepted the murder of your husband? - What are you talking about? - You never cared who killed Jack Kennedy. You never cared why. You never cared what conspiracy was really behind it. - Of course I cared, but nothing could bring him back. - You see her at her husband's funeral. She never cried once. And we all thought she was being so courageous. - How do you know what I felt or if I cried? I was there with him. I held him. He died in my arms. How dare you suggest I never cared. - Did you shed one tear for my son? And in New York, when we heard about the accident, you were on the telephone immediately, so calm, so aloof. - Ari. I was trying to do something to help. - Do nothing to help me. You can't even barely look at me because of the pain I'm in. Because it is ugly, because it frightens you. - Papa, please. - What runs through your veins, it is not blood, it is too cold to be blood. - I think I should leave. - Yes, go. We will never understand each other. It was all a mistake. A mistake. - He's going to divorce you. - He's very ill, he won't go through with it. - Well, he's hired a detective, and put a wiretap on your phone. - I don't believe it. - But he couldn't prove any extramarital affairs. - I could have told him that. - So, he's going a different route. - He has started a publicity campaign against you. He has leaked documentation of your so-called extravagant spending habits to Jack Anderson. - He's going to print that in his news column? - You bet he will. - Why is Ari being so vicious? - He's bitter, he's hurt. And he wants you to sign a new financial agreement. Reducing your share. - Is that what you advise? - Look, Joe Kennedy is dead. You have cut ties with the family. Let's say you and Ari are divorced. Without a powerful man like Onassis in your life as a fried, what would be the reality? The only way to protect you, Jackie, would be with a new financial agreement. [horn beeping] - Hello Christina. Ari. Ari, I'm here. - Hey. [chuckles] I must be close to the end if you come all the way to Paris to see me. - That's not funny. - Are you staying at the Avenue Foch apartment? - Yes. I'm getting it ready for you. - You made it very beautiful. You made all our places beautiful. That is the riddle. - What is the riddle? - How to live. Don't bury the pain, Jackie. Experience it. - But I have. - No, no, no no, you've... You've run from pain. You gorge yourself on beautiful things. As if it is only beautiful things that make life... Livable. - Ari. Ari, I'm here. [gentle music] - And our legends. Thanatos. Death is the twin brother of Hypnos. Sleep. Make sure that the best practice Thanatos on me. Make sure they make me sleep. [gentle dramatic music] [speaking in Latin] [background noise drowns out dialogue] - 20 million is that correct? - Mrs. Onassis, was it 25 million? - Jackie, what was the exact figure? [phone ringing] - How are you surviving your first day in publishing, Mrs. Onassis? - Oh, there's a lot to learn, but I'm very excited about the opportunity. - What are you working on? - A celebration of women in 18th Century America. But I'm so nervous about the presentation. What do I do, what do I say? - There's a presentation in the trade division going on right now. Why don't you slip in and observe? I'll check on you later. - Thanks. Hello Ana. - Hi Mom. - Hi Caroline. - Have a rough day? - Don't even ask. Hi John. Ooh, what's all this? - Just showing our support of a working mother. - Mm-hmm. And what else? Thank you. Oh, might as well plunge in. - I got a call from David Sterwin. Do you know who he is? - A movie producer? - He wants to make a movie about Dad as a young man. And he wants me to play the part. - Oh really. - Isn't it cool? - Why you? I mean aside from the obvious, aren't there other established young actors who could... - But John is good. He's been getting great reviews at Brown, and Sterwin heard about him. - Well, it's very flattering, but I won't let you do it. - Why not? - Because you need to finish school. - Mom, I'm not going to drop out of school because of this. - No, I won't let you become an actor. - Mother, you can't just dictate what John should do with his life. - He can do whatever he wishes after graduation. As long as it isn't acting. - I don't understand. It's the one thing I'm good at. - John. Darling. You haven't even begun to discover what you're good at. - Mother, didn't you have the same fights with grandma? Like the time you wanted to go study in Europe. - Yes. And when I wanted to marry your father and campaign with him even though I was pregnant. She always thought she new best. - But you did what you wanted to anyway. So why can't John and I? - Because I was a Bouvier, and you are Kennedys. My mother didn't have to protect me from assassins and deranged people on the street from the time I was five. I'm sorry if this upsets you, Caroline, but you and John, you've inherited a different world. Watch your step, mother. - Where are we going? - To the back house, where you will live. - Servants quarters. - No, I renovated it for you. It's filled with all your beautiful things. - Real estate was never Huey's strong point. - I'm sorry we had to sell this place. - He died 10 years ago this month. - That's right. You always seemed so sure of yourself as a mother. - Of course I was sure. - I worry all the time about Caroline and John. If I'm helping them make the right choices. Caroline is going to marry Ed Schlossberg. - Who's Caroline? - Your granddaughter. Ed is the man she's been seeing. - I don't know him. - Yes, you do. You've met him several times. Ed's a lovely person. The only problem is he's 13 years older than she is. - Jack Kennedy was 12 years older than you. - Ah, that you remember. - Of course I remember. - Mrs. Onassis, Mrs. Vreeland is here. - Diana Vreeland. - The same Jackie. It's marvelous, it's quite simply divine. You are a most precious national treasure and editor. No, no no. Editing is too simplistic a term to use for what you do, darling. Replicating. That's it! You put a little of yourself, a little lump of Jackie into every book that you edit. - You're too kind, I've only started. Please. - You must have a kitchen stool. I'll have mine copied line for line and send it too you. It's great for your back. I admire your spartan arrangements. - Oh, this is after my promotion. - Nonsense. Desk, four walls, that's all you need. Viola. Red. You should have red. I've always loved anything in red, and pink. Of course pink is the navy blue of India. Now tell me, before we get into the book. How are John Junior and Caroline? - Oh, both fine, thank you. And both in law school. - Oh my God. Two lawyers in the family, heaven. - And Caroline is pregnant. - Caroline? You're going to be a grandmother. - I know, I can't quite comprehend it. - Oh, you will, my dear, you will. When you hold that baby in your arms. - If I ever get it away from Caroline. - It is quite simply the most special feeling the world. It's what life is all about. - Yes. Now, shall we talk about your book on Imperial Russia? - We're going to do something that is going to make your future grandchild very proud of you. You've done so well for yourself. You've made a life of your own. - I'm trying. [gentle music] - Dr. Parker. Doctor [background noise drowns out dialogue] Parker. - What the matter? - I'm sorry. I guess it's just the excitement. - Mom, Caroline's going to be fine. And the baby's going to be fine. - And you are going to be fine, I know. - Sure I am. Mom, we love you, Caroline and I, you know that. Don't you? - Yes. Yes. Then somehow it makes it all worth while. All of it. All of it. [laughing] Oh, well done. There. - We're gonna name her Rose. After Grandma Rose Kennedy. - She's beautiful. [laughs] I only hope nobody calls her Rosie. [laughing] [uplifting music] [gentle music]
