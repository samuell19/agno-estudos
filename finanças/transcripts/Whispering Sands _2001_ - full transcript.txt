Step right up! Herbal medicine for sale. Aphrodisiacs, herbal medicine, strength for the men. Step right up! My father left us when I was young. I woke up one day and he was gone. All that was left was his voice. One day the wind will bring us together again. As far as I remember there was only the two of us. Mother and I, Berlian (Diamond). The hardest stone. One... two... three... Mother always knows where I am. Why are you always late fetching water? I was just about to. Child, come here! It's very hot outside. How many times have I told you - not to go near that grassy mound? There's nothing there, Mother. It's nice and shady. People say that young girls should not go there. It's not good! You always go there. Go and dry this! Child... I'm going to Midwife Suri's place. Here, drink this, so you'll sleep well. I am Sinta. Where can you be, Rama? One... two... three... Come back tomorrow! Now, right now, please! I'm not feeling well. Come back tomorrow. No. It must be done now. My mother will know something's wrong. Berlian, wait! Let me bury it tomorrow. This is for Daya. There will be two more tomorrow. Come on, go in! Corpses! There are corpses on the beach! More of them every day. Mother, why are there so many dead people? Because there is no rain. Why, Mother? When people are hot, they get angry easily. They do strange things and have strange thoughts. When will it rain? Can I have the herbal sleeping drink? I'm having trouble sleeping these days. Make that two! Quickly! Thank you. Ahh, that's better! Daya is growing up, isn't she? That husband of yours, when is he coming back? Where does he work? Far away, he says. Far away... tell him to come back soon, or who knows what will become of his wife and daughter. As long as they don’t turn out like those pretty ones. Hey, Daya, come here and I'll teach you to put on make-up properly. You look like you are wearing a mask. It's ugly. Child! Child! I've told you again not to go near those women. Don't talk to them at all. Don't even talk if you are spoken to. Round and around and around... - Child! Round and around and around... Auntie! Daya, you’ve grown so much. How are you? How's your mother? Since when don't you eat vegetables? Have you forgotten? I've never liked vegetables. No, you always finished the vegetables that I prepared for you when you were small. Sister - there are a lot of people murdered in town. It's happening here as well. It has reached here? Yes. I heard a hut was burnt last week. Yes. Midwife Suri said that many people have moved. The roads here are becoming dangerous. They say that the safest route is through Pasir Putih. Isn't it time for you to move as well? What for? This is our home. Their home is here too, and they left. Just because they left doesn't mean we also have to leave. I am not like you, always running away from problems. Sister - I did not run! I left! Mother is at the food stall looking at us. You have to take care of your mother. Mother... Mother takes care of herself very well. Don't say that, she loves you. When Father comes, we'll go away together... carried by the wind. But he's been gone for quite a while now. Do you even remember what he looks like? When he comes... I'll know... I'll know. What are they whispering this time? Burn! Burn everything! Mother, what's wrong? What's happening? Hurry! Come on! Mother, where are we going? Somewhere else. Where, mother? Somewhere safe. Does Auntie Delima know where we're going? Does father know where we'll be? Does Mrs. Suri know where we're going, mother? How will they know where we'll be, mother? He will not look for us. He will look for me. He will look for me... He will look for me... Sir - which way is Pasir Putih? To the east, behind the hills. Which road do we follow? Road? There are no roads here. No roads? There was a road once but now it's closed. Closed by who? By the sand. Wait a minute. Here's some food for you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Mother - it's going to rain. There is no rain here. That’s not rain? - That's sand. Seems like we are not alone here. Where are you going? Nowadays it isn't advisable to walk alone without a man. Which way is it? Pasir Putih? A place of refuge. It's over there. This is for you, sweet miss. You will need it. It's obvious that you are not aware of the legend in this area. Once upon a time there was a country thriving on these sands but because the king and his sons were unjust and cruel to the people, the gods in the sky said, "teach them a lesson." And with one mighty blow of the winds, the land was overturned under the sands without light. Which is why you must be careful. Because this is no ordinary mask. You must wear it behind your head so that the desert ghosts cannot take you to their land beneath the earth. What about mother? She needs a mask as well. Don't worry. She doesn't need a mask. She already has eyes in the back of her head. Goodbye, the winds will bring us together again one day. Mother - listen. What? The desert ghosts! Child, what's the use of the mask, if you continuously look behind? Is this hut empty? - Yes. That small hut is a strange one... built in the direction of the wind... as if in defiance. Every morning the sand covers it. It used to be a food stall for travelers. No one stays here for long. Child! How much is this? There's no need to pay, just take them. Child, I'm going out for a while. Take care. What song is that? A song that my grandmother used to sing to me. You have a strange name. How do you know my name? I know that your name is Child. My name is Daya. Then why does your mother call you Child? You know my name but I don’t know yours. My name is Sukma. I live here with my grandfather near where you live. My grandfather teaches several children from around here. Oh no. My mother mustn't know about this. Why not? She will definitely make me go there. We always know when new people arrive. How do you know? From the smell of the sand. Every new person will always bring new sand. What does it smell like? Well, there is no smell. Smell it. There is no smell. Where are you off to so early in the morning? Do drop by. Child, some hot water. What's wrong with your leg? It aches. What should I use, do you think? This might work. Would you like to try it? It's a poultice for sprains or aches. Come again if you need more. Pay me later, if I can exchange it for some sugar. Of course, thank you. If you have anything to trade or sell I can take it to the market. Yes. I know I will go there later. If you need medicinal drinks, don't hesitate to come here. Who's he, mother? They say that he often helps people around here. Can my daughter come here to study? Of course, she can study with Sukma. Thank you. Child. Come in. Now it's time to count. Nine divided by three is... who knows the answer? What is wrong with you two? So slow. Look at me. Nine divided by three... is three! I am this old but I think very fast. During the Japanese period I was the assistant to a Japanese general. Servant, a servant, you were. A servant to a Japanese general. Yes, well an assistant is a servant, but a servant to whom...

Until when, mother? Forever. But there has to be a rainy season. The rains will come. Where were you? Nowhere. Both of you must have gone those rocks. Go take a bath. Sukma’s grandfather said that you learnt how to count. I'd like to hear you. Nine times one is nine. Nine times two is eighteen. Nine times nine is... two hundred. Nine times one hundred is twenty-two. Nine times five... Daya, look. There are carvings here as well. What carvings? It looks like a mountain. This is my picture. This is me. Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! Daya! - Auntie! Here. What is it, auntie? Open it. Try it. You look pretty. Thank you, auntie. Child! Go to bed otherwise you'll oversleep tomorrow. I'll sleep in the hut. Can I see you perform tomorrow night? It's better that you don't, Daya. But you'll leave soon, and I haven't seen you dance before. Yes, I know. But your mother will never allow you to be out so late. Nothing is allowed. I want my father to come and take me away. Auntie, tell me again about father. What is he like? He must be a brave man. I wonder where he has traveled. Child! Child! Child... go inside. My name is Daya, Mother, not Child. Child, inside! Not Child, Mother. My name is Daya. I have a name. Why can't you call me by my name? If you continue this way, you will lose her. You will lose her the way you lost Mother, Father and me. You will lose her! Maybe, but not today. Auntie, take me with you. Please, auntie. Mother, it's getting cold outside. Mother. No. I don't know where else to go. You should have thought of that when you left. That was then, a long time ago. Yes, but now I don't need you anymore. Child, what's wrong? A beautiful girl, my love, follow me. In love, so desperately in love. The princely Gatotkoco Pinggodani looks on.

What? - A red kebaya. Listen, but don't tell your mother - One day soon your father here will be a famous person. And when that time comes... I will buy everything for you. I will buy things for your mother. Soon there will be a way, you'll see. Food does not just appear on its own. There has to be someone to peel, to cut, to cook. It's almost finished, you know. Daya, this tobacco is from Sumatra. It's so special that the Sumatran monkey, they'll eat it, they'll chew on it. Child, fetch some water, the fog is setting. Tell me more later, father.
