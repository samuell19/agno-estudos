Tonight, the dinner seems to be extravagant in Shetty’s home. Yeah, their grandson is coming from Delhi. They are sacrificing the rooster we caught. - Yes, they have to. [Sathisha] Shetty won’t be satisfied by poultry chicken, he always wants a country chicken. [Haala] Off course, he has so many country chickens. [Haala] Anyhow during normal days only two of them will be there... ...but today their grandson is coming, why wouldn’t he sacrifice one? [Manja] Enough of waste talks, get up and get back to work. Why are you grinding here when got mixer? If you grind in mixer, curry won’t taste that good. Is it so..! It’s always better to grind in grinding rock if you are cooking non-veg. Curry will be very tasty. Vanaja, where is the scythe? Need to get banana leaf. It’s below the table. - Okay. Sumanth, come let’s go to get some banana leaves. Yeah, Okay. I will be back Grandma. Careful..! It’s a bit steep here, cautiously place your foot. Yeah grandpa. Come. There they are, look we’ll get those. - Yeah, there are plenty of them. Yes, we will get those. See over there, I put those saplings on your grandma’s insisting. It’s bearing fruit. Yeah, but there’s no demand for areca nutthis year. Pepper wines have grown too. Yes, but we'll see whether we can sell them for a good price or not. It all depends on luck. Anyhow we’ll see. Areca nut is what we have this time. Which one to choose? - Let’s go that side. Due to pest lot of banana saplings were lost this year. Ah! Red ant bit me. Damn those ants, there are lot of them. Careful Kiddo. We are used to all these, you might find a bit difficult. Here, we can get the leaves from this one. - Yeah? If it’s alright then we’ll get the leaves from here itself. It's good. Catch it. Catch it Yeah, like that. We need to cut the tip of the leaf. Turn it towards you. Not like that. Yeah, there you go. We just need to cut the tip. Now, let’s cut them into pieces. I think that’s of no use now. This could be of use to us, we make two out of this. Throw it away grandpa, we’ll look for the better one. No, let’s not waste what we have. We can do two pieces in this. - Yeah. We’ll get one more. How much do we actually need for ritual? One for the ritual, one while sacrificing. Then, we need some for dinner. Wait, we’ll get two more, - Okay. Here, this would be fine. Catch this one. Catch it. - Yes, cut it. Yeah like that. Wait, let me cut it first. We shouldn’t take the whole leaf inside the home. It’s a bad omen if we take the whole leaf. Hold it properly. This leaf is very good. Hold it tightly or else it gonna tear. Wait, we will cut another one. Hold it. Got it? - Yes. This leaf is really good. I think it’s enough. - You think so? Yeah, that’s enough, hold them. We’ll keep these aside, workers will take care of it tomorrow. Shall we leave then? - Lets go or else it will be late. Careful while you go. We have a lot of work to do kiddo. - Oh! then we’ll go fast. How the areca nut is coming out this year? - What? Areca. - It’s fine till now. Careful..! Don’t jump like that. Don’t be in a hurry, you might hurt yourself. It’s been a while I came here. Yeah, after you left for Delhi, it’s been around 3 years now. At first while you were here going to school, but now it's… Damn this spider web! - What? Spider web! - Yeah, it’s gone. Spider, ants are common here. Call your grandma there if you need. Grandma... [Sumanth] Grandma..! [Vanaja] Yeah, I am preparing the torch for ritual. [Mahabala coughs] [Vanaja] Keep on smoking like this, your cough will get even worse... ...At least you warn him once. [Sumanth] Grandpa, why don’t you quit smoking? You all just keep quiet. Am I smoking from two days? I am smoking from many years. Smoking beedi keeps me going. She’s out of her mind. Don’t listen to her. Come let’s go. Did you get everything? [Sumanth] Yes, I did. [Sumanth] Torch, coconut and... is this rice enough? Yeah, that’s enough. Let's go. - Yeah. Let’s get the rooster and get going. Huh? Where the hell is it? What? - The Rooster. [Vanaja] What? Where did it go? [Vanaja] What are you saying? It was there itself. It was right here under this basket, and I served it with rice and water while going to paddy fields. Where could it go by now? Didn’t you tie it properly? - It was properly tied. Why the hell are we talking, let’s go find it! [Calling the rooster] Where could it be? [Mahabala] How can a rooster escape from under the basket? The spices are ready for rooster, now this damn rooster is not ready. [Sumanth] If it’s really in forest, then we cannot get it. [Mahabala] Do one thing, you both go look on the other side of the farm. I’ll go look in forest. [Mahabala] This bloody rooster is playing with us! Let me get hold of that once, I’ll show it. There’s no chance we can find it now. Never before happened like this. What to do now? - Nothing can be done. We can’t use other roosters as they are offered to god, we can’t sacrifice them till Diwali festival. But there are two hens, we’ll use them instead. Okay, we’ll do as you said. Come, let’s go. We could’ve sacrificed those two hens by now. Yeah, and it’s getting dark too. Let’s just wait till grandpa arrives. This is the first time something like this happened. It’s gone for good. [Vanaja] Can we sacrifice those hens instead? What should we do then? We have to search for it, that’s what we should be doing. It’s already dark, how are we supposed to look for it? Anyhow the spices are ready, we’ll use for the hens... ...otherwise spices will be a waste. I am seriously thinking about did it escaped or someone stole it, here you are worried about your spices. What could have got it during daytime? Who knows? Something came it seems. Might be your dad’s ghost. [Vanaja] Will you get those hens or not? It's getting late. Look here, I kept that rooster for my grandson. I’ll find the same rooster and serve him. Got it? Are you out of your mind? Look, there’s some dry fish inside, prepare curry with it. I’ll take bath now. [Vanaja sighs] Instead of serving you chicken curry, I am serving dry fish curry. That’s enough. Damn! He don’t like dry fish curry, look how he’s picking it out. [Mahabala] He likes chicken curry very much. How's it kiddo? If it was chicken then it would’ve been nice, dry fish is just okay. I am like Sherlock around these parts. Look how I’ll find that rooster and serve it before you leave. Vanaja, bring some water. Keep it here. You sleep on the couch kiddo. Where will you all sleep? I will sleep in room, your grandpa will sleep down here. No, I’ll sleep down here itself. No, you just sleep on couch. Enough with formalities. I’ll sleep here. - Okay boy. Want some paan? - No, I am not used to it. I will visit the astrologer's home tomorrow. [Vanaja] Why astrologer’s home? [Mahabala] Can you find the rooster? He might give us some suggestions to find it. Get that rooster out of your mind first. I will visit him tomorrow, let us see what happens. Kiddo, when will you be leaving? May be after 3 or 4 days. My wish is to get that rooster and serve you the chicken curry... ...before you leave for city. That’s okay if you can't find the rooster, but don’t stress yourself. It’s not about stressing out, at least we should know the cause. I am sure it happened afternoon, anyhow we’ll get to know after meeting astrologer. Can’t you just give a police complaint? Police? They’ll laugh at us. [Vanaja] Do you need a extra blanket? - No, this is enough. Alright then let’s just get some sleep now. We’ll see tomorrow. Shall I turn off the lights? [Mahabala] No, I’ll do that, you go to sleep now. [Sumanth] Good night grandma. - Good rite kiddo. [Mahabala] Same here. Damn! I am not at all getting sleep. Sumanth, are you asleep? [Vanaja] Look at this man! He has smoked a lot thinking about that damn rooster. [Vanaja] Sumanth, come and have some tea. - I’ll be there. Can’t you go afternoon? No, there will be a long queue during afternoon. So, I’ll go now. Okay? [Mahabala] Go get my scooter key now. Will you come with me? - Sorry, You carry on grandpa. Not required. You stay with your grandma. She’ll get you something to eat. Take it. - Thanks. [Maani reading Mantras] Maani, is your father in the house? - Yes, please go inside. [Mahabala] Hello..! [Astrologer] Oh! Mahabala Shetty..! Please sit down. What did you say? - I just said to sit down. LEARN ENGLISH IN 30 DAYS [Mahabala] Are you learning English? [Astrologer] Yeah, a lot of people are coming from outside, anyhow I don’t speak English or Hindi, so I am making an attempt to learn. Okay, that's ambitious. [Astrologer] Then, how are you? - I am fine. Susheela, [Astrologer's wife] Yes. Bring some coffee for Shetty. How are you? - God’s grace everything is fine. [Astrologer] What brought you here? The thing is... a rooster in my home has disappeared suddenly. What? A rooster! - Yeah yeah I caught it for my grandson for preparing chicken curry. But when we were about to sacrifice, the rooster was not there. [Astrologer] Hmmm. So, the rooster is missing! Yes, could you please check that if it was stolen or escaped? Let us see what happened. This is not done by outsiders. Someone whom you are familiar with has stolen the rooster. Someone whom I know? Who can it be? It’s not out of this locality, it’s alive. - Is it? You will find it if you try well. What about your fees? [Astrologer] Give as you wish. - Okay. [Mahabala] Here it is. I’ll leave now. - God bless you. [Mahabala] Bye Maani. [Sumanth] Grandma, you are getting a call. [Vanaja] Okay, answer it kiddo. It’s mom. [Vanaja] Oh! Go near the gate and talk to her. Hello, What’s up? Actually... The rooster is missing..! Yesterday evening when we were about to sacrifice... ...the rooster was not there. Grandma made dry fish curry with no choice. Grandpa has gone to astrologer for getting guidance. Wait, grandpa is coming. I’ll call you later. Did you meet him? Yeah, it seems someone who we know has stole it from us. Someone we know? Who it might be? Did anybody come yesterday? Nobody came, just us and those three workers. At what time did they leave yesterday? Don’t know when they left, I was sleeping. They didn’t inform you before leaving? They didn’t inform you also? - [Vanaja] No, they didn't. Didn’t you see them? - No I didn’t. I was also sleeping. I think someone in those bastards has stolen the rooster! Would you please be quiet? Why would they steal? You might have fallen asleep. So, to avoid disturbing you they should’ve left without informing. They might be coming by now. Is there any coconut in shed? There are some, why? - You’ll get to know why. Come with me kiddo. Come. Why coconut? Look for that coconut peeler. - It’s right there. Where? - Here. Get it for me. Keep it here. Get me a coconut. Look there it is. - Yeah, got it. Why do you need the coconut for? - Wait, I’ll tell. You will get to know slowly. Give it to me, I will do it. No, I can do it by myself. I’ll do it. - Yeah, you take it. Yeah, like that. Remove it. Okay, use the peeler, I am done with it. Let me see your skills now. Yeah, do it like that. I got it. Yeah, I see it. Remove that properly. Don’t remove the crest. Yeah, leave the crest. That’s fine, give it to me. Come, let's go. - Dust is all over me. That’s how it’s done. [Mahabala] They underestimated me, I’ll see how they’ll escape now. Look, how they will speak the truth now. So, you will make them to take oath on coconut. Off course. At least they will tell the truth by the fear of god. Why didn’t you say it when I asked you? Always shouting like an asshole. Do you think they will tell the truth? Yes, they have to speak the truth if they take oath on coconut. No one can lie. [Manja] We have to finish our work today. - Yeah yeah. Shut the fuck up you crazy dog. Hey come here, let’s have a tea. [Manja] Haala, let’s drink. Sit down. Where is Sathisha? Yesterday there was a ceremony in Shridhar anna’s house. He ate too much there. Now his stomach is upset but he might come afternoon. Oh! It might be a great full course dinner then. You go get some tea. - Okay, I will get it. This must be your grandson right? [Mahabala] Yeah, the one I told you about. Take him with you to Delhi, he’s a fine worker. Go away man. You are embarrassing me. Yesterday you had a good dinner it seems? Those bloody bastards wouldn’t let us have a good dinner. What happened Shettre? Manja, someone has stolen the rooster. - Is it? [Mahabala] At what time you people left yesterday? May be around 3 pm? Isn’t so? Yeah, we left around 3 or 3:30 pm. Did you see anyone else in the farm? We didn’t see anyone. At what time it might have happened? It happened when we were taking a nap in the afternoon. Who could’ve come at that time Shettre? Shettre, no one has the guts to steal here. As per my knowledge it might have escaped. Look, there is no way it might have escaped. This has been planned and executed. It’s strange to hear. Yeah, a kind of strange thing. So, you people also have not seen anyone? No. Is that so? I have been to astrologer’s home this morning. He said someone you know has done this job. You people act like you don’t know anything. What do you mean? You think we have stolen the rooster? You guys always informed me before leaving, Why didn’t you inform me yesterday? It’s not like that Shettre... You were sleeping when we were about leave. So, we thought not to disturb you. [Mahabala] Let me see will you speak the truth or not. [Mahabala] Okay then, take a oath on this coconut... ...and tell me you guys didn’t do it. Shettre, why would we do such a thing while we are working for you? Look, I don’t know anything about it, just take the oath and prove it to me. Shettre, why would we take the risk of stealing your rooster... ...when we have so many of them in our home. Till I met astrologer I didn’t have clue that it was stolen. Now when I am given guidance about the issue, is it a wrong thing to ask you people about it? You want us to take a oath on coconut right? - Yes. Tell the truth because you know what happens if you lie. By taking the oath... ...I am saying that I didn’t steal the rooster. Now, you take the oath. I didn’t steal. I don’t know. What you didn’t steal and what don’t know of? - The rooster. Say that properly man. - What am I supposed to say? Repeat the same thing what he said earlier. Clearly say that you didn’t steal the rooster. I didn’t steal the rooster and I don’t know who did it. Are trying to play games with me? [Sumanth] Touch the coconut and say the same thing. [Mobile rings] Wait, I’ll answer that. Recharge with rupees 149, and enjoy unlimited calls to all networks. Shut up you bloody bitch! I am worried about the rooster, and this lady is telling some bullshit. Keep it there. Look, tell me what happened properly. I didn’t steal the rooster and I don’t know who did it. If your doubt is cleared, we will go to work now. Vanaja, take this coconut. When will Sathisha come? He told me that he would be coming afternoon. Haala, take my scooter and go get Sathisha now itself. Key is there itself. [Haala] Okay Shettre. Get going. Careful with my scooter, it’s a bit old. - Got it. Go ahead and start your work, I’ll come there in some time. Okay? - Okay. Haala, get him quickly. Get him. - Okay sure. I don’t want any reasons. Hello, what's up man? It’s a 8th time now since morning, I am in the woods. Gosh..! Whatever it is... finish it and come near canal. Shettru wants to see you urgently, I am on my way to get you. I can't now! I’ll come afternoon if possible. I am saying it's urgent. What the fuck you are so urgent about? I’ll come and explain you everything, I am on my way. Okay, I will come - Okay, see you then. Manja, Don’t feel bad about what happened. What do you expect me to do then? Manja, look at me. I have known you for a long time and I trust you. But I am suspicious about them. Haala wouldn’t do such a thing, he don’t have that courage. Then why did he hesitate to take the oath? He’s very scared of deity, that’s why he hesitated. He’s not the one. So, you think Satisha might be the one? I don’t know whether he’s the one or not, but I don’t trust him. He said that his stomach is upset after being to ceremony. But did anyone saw that he’s been there? [Manja] No one. That's true he’s suffering from dysentery. I saw him running towards woods with a mug of water. I think he stole your chicken and prepared chicken curry. Ate too much of it and spoiled his stomach. So, you are saying that’s what happened. Let him come, we’ll see whether he takes the oath or not. I am confident that he won’t touch the coconut. Let him come, I’ll make him in front of you all. I know what to do. [Mahabala] Them and their bullshit stories. [Sathisha] Stop for a moment man! [Haala] Wait for 5 minutes, we are near to home. I can’t hold it man, stop the scooter. How are you going to wipe your ass over here? Wait for 5 minutes, we are near to home. I’ll wipe my ass from leaves, please stop here man. You should change your name as ShitMan. Tighten your ass and hold it for a while. Don't shit on scooter. Look we are already there. Tighten your ass. We are almost there. [Sathisha] Stop it here! - Wait! Don’t jump from the bike now. [Mahabala] What happened to you? Nothing Shettre, my stomach is upset. I’ll go in woods and come. Don’t you dare to go there, I need to get leaves from there every morning. Use the toilet room instead. Get going fast. [Sathisha] It’s very urgent! - That’s all fine, get going now. I will be back soon. [Mahabala] Run fast, don't shit in your underwear. [Sathisha] What the fuck? There’s no water here. [Sighs] Did you flush it all out? I am tired of flushing it all out since morning. Is that so? He said something urgent, is there any work Shettre? Nothing like that. Did you see anyone around our house yesterday afternoon? I didn’t see anyone, Why? The rooster we caught that day, seems stolen by someone. Really? Listen, he’s been to astrologer’s house, it seems someone who Shettru knows has done this job. So, he made us to take the oath. It's your turn now. I don’t know anything, I didn’t do it. Touch the coconut and say that. I swear on my parents I didn’t steal it, I don’t know anything. I don’t want you to swear on your parents, just touch this and take the oath. I am telling the truth I didn’t steal your rooster, and I don’t want to take oath on deity too. If you don’t do it then blame will be on you. Hey, don’t blame me. [Manja] Then, touch the coconut! [Sathisha] I won’t do it. Why are you being so stubborn? Three years back, when my neighbour lost his phone, he wanted me to take the oath. I haven’t even seen how his phone looks like... ...but still I took the oath on deity. Next day itself I was hospitalized and spent 5000 rupees for treatment. From that onwards I stopped touching any coconut. [Manja] Shut up! You stole that mobile that’s why you were hospitalized. Manja, stop blaming me you fucker. What will you do? Yesterday, while leaving work you came back to get banana leaves, did you actually came for leaves or to steal the rooster? Son of a bitch, you are the one who came back. [Mahabala] Hey Sathisha, stop it! [Sathisha] I’ll break your nose. [Haala] Hey, leave him! [Mahabala] Don't fight! [Sathisha] Shettre, these two who came back, not me. [Mahabala] Sathisha, just fucking stop it. [Haala] Don't fight! leave it man. [Sathisha] I will break your teeth. How can you blame me? [Mahabala] I’ll smash this coconut on your head if you don’t stop. [Haala] Get up! Come this side. [Sathisha] Haala, leave me. What the hell is this? Don’t you feel shy? Being grown ups and behaving like this. Haala, get him up. Look everyone, nobody has stolen the rooster. Okay? It vanished into thin air. Hey, why are you following me again? I think I have to go to toilet room again. Get the fuck out of here and don’t shit in your underwear. Wipe your ass properly. [Vanaja] Here they come. [Vanaja] Do you guys want tea? [Haala] No thanks, we will go home and drink. [Mahabala] Count it once, it should be 6000 rupees. [Vanaja] This dog always barks on seeing Manja. [Haala] Yeah, did you hit the dog anytime? - [Manja] No, why would I hit! [Sumanth] Yeah, it’s exact. [Mahabala] Is it 6000? [Sumanth] Yes. Manja, take it. Haala, take it. Sathisha, Your part of job is done. I’ve told women workers to put the manure. I’ll call you guys at the time of harvesting, alright? [Manja] Alright. Bye then. [Haala] See you. [Haala] Shedtiyare, we will take a leave. [Mahabala] Okay okay. [Mahabala] Vanaja, please do some tea. I need to go to toilet again. you guys keep going, I’ll join later. Go and sleep there itself. Shettre, can I use your toilet room again? Do you think it’s a public toilet? What a shitty day! Anyhow use it. Don’t shit in your underwear now. Damn! I am telling the truth, I didn’t steal your rooster. Don’t keep repeating the same thing. You just went to toilet room right? Get the fuck out of here before you shit yourself. I don’t know who stole the rooster but... ...they were the one who came back to take banana leaves. [Kannada serial playing on TV] [Mahabala] When will you be leaving kiddo? I’ll leave day after tomorrow morning. Is it? Then we’ll use those two hens for tomorrow’s dinner. Yeah, it's fine. I told you yesterday itself to do that. We can't find that rooster. Sacrifice those two hens tomorrow. Okay then, we’ll sacrifice those hens. Did you feed the dog? - Yeah. Did you? - Yes I did. Kiddo, today there’s a Yakshagana (Play). - Oh! Really? Shall we go? - Yeah, sure. It’s been a while I saw a play. - Is it? Then let’s leave. - Okay. I will get ready. - Okay. Vanaja, get us something to eat. - Sure. We will leave after having dinner. [Yakshagana Beats] [Mukaasura] What? [Demon] Hold it. I don’t like him. - Is that so? Where he is now? I can’t stand sight of him. - Why do you hate him so much? Why do you hate him so much? - I can’t stand a sight of him. You can’t stand him? - Yeah, I hate him. Mukasura, - Yeah. The reason for his coming is, A lot of valuable items are lost in the celestial ocean. So, in order to get them, he needs our help. Grandpa, - Yeah? Grandpa.., - Yeah. I feel that big guy was the one who stole the rooster. Who, Manja? - Yes. The way he speaks and pressurizes others, I feel he’s trying to hide something. And even our dog also points him while barking! What? - Our dog points him while barking! I think he is the culprit. [Mahabala] We can’t ignore that thought. Yeah, you have a point there. I will do one thing. - What's it? Tomorrow morning I will go and have a look around his house. Okay. We’ll know then. - Yeah. Don’t tell your grandma. - No, I won't. I'll tell her that I am leaving for town. - Fine. Now let’s watch the play. Damn! This scooter is not starting! There is no petrol it seems. Petrol is there. Why do you have to leave so early for buying fish? Can't you go later? If I go now, I’ll get the fresh fish. Afternoon, they’ll sell the stale ones. Or else we can make Eggplant’s curry for lunch. Eggplant's curry? He is leaving tomorrow, so we’ll do fish for afternoon. For night, we’ll use those hens for curry. Now stop bothering me. Have a look at this kiddo. It started. Shall I leave then? - Okay. Vanaja, I am leaving. I’ll be back. - Yeah, see you. Come soon. - Sure. Manja.., Hey, Manja! [Manja] Yeah, I am here in backyard. I am coming. Oh Shettre! What bought you here so early? Anything urgent? Please be seated. Where’s your family? All have been to mother’s village. Is that so? Only they have gone... ...or even the rooster has been sent with them? Or you already made the curry? What the hell are you talking about? I think I heard a chicken noise inside. Yeah, some chickens grazing in backyard. Hey Shettre, where are you going? [Manja] What happened to him? Shettre, What happened? Shettre, stop for once. Yesterday you were blaming others. What you got to say now? Why did you steal it? Even after having so much of your own chickens. Look at its foot. [Mahabala] What the hell is with its foot? See, it has five fingers! Oh! You stole this rooster for five fingers? Is it? I would have given this foot to you after sacrificing it. Say. It’s not like that, If a human has 6 fingers it brings luck, In the same way if a chicken has 5 fingers it brings luck to the one who owns it. Bullshit! Who filled all this in your head? From the beginning our family has been working under others, and we are still poor. My Grandma used to say that if someone owns a pigeon or chicken with 5 fingers.. ...then it will bring good luck. [Manja] That day while tying its legs, I saw it had 5 fingers..! [Manja] I felt like I was holding my luck in my hands. If I asked you, would you give it to me? It was kept for my grandson from a long time. How can I give it to you? That's why on the same night, I came to steal the rooster... [Manja] ...the dog barked and you woke up. [Manja] I ran away behind the cow shed. Later, I thought it would be better to steal during afternoon... ...when you were asleep. So, we came and stole in the same way as Sathisha mentioned in the farm. [Mahabala] That bastard Haala is also with you in this..? I told him I would give him 1000 rupees if he helps. For god sake you didn’t plan to kill me for this rooster. Thank you for that. Look here. Never show your face again, and don't come to our house again. Please don’t mention anything to your wife. Okay, we’ll see about that. Stop it here. I’ll come within a moment, turn it and keep it ready. Kiddo, - Yes grandpa! Get that basket to keep the rooster under it. Quick! Quick! [Vanaja] Where did you find it? Is this ours? [Mahabala] I’ll explain it later, okay? Got it? Come here. Let’s hide it inside the house before it disappears again. Where are you going again? I’ll get fish for lunch. - Okay. We’ll prepare chicken dishes for dinner. - Okay got it. Careful with the rooster till I come back. I will be back. - Okay. Hey, I am coming. Wait..! I’ll drop you while heading to market. Yeah, Sit. Slowly man, do you think I am teenager? You are hopping in like a pig. [Kannada serial playing on TV] [Mahabala] Fish was not that good. [Vanaja] Yeah, he fed more to cat than he ate. [Mahabala] Where is he? [Vanaja] He went to call his mother to tell about the rooster. [Mahabala] Check is it still there or something happened like last time. [Vanaja] Don’t worry. It’s there. Come, lets go. Is that where? - Yeah we’ll go ahead. We could’ve have killed it right away. But it’s better to perform the rituals in the name of god. Hold the rooster tight, I’ll do all the rituals. Wait, not like that. I’ll do it. We have to offer the rice first, - Oh! Got it? Didn’t you oil it well? - I told grandma to do it. I think she didn’t do it properly it seems. Look at this trouble now. Let's sacrifice the rooster now. [Sumanth] Where should I throw the rooster after cutting? - That side. Throw it! Throw it! Yeah, enough. You get that rooster. I will get these. I’ll get all these, you just bring that to the backyard. - Okay grandpa. Are you coming? - Yes I am. Come fast. Wait grandpa! - Yeah? I want the leg piece as a whole. Do you want the leg piece? - Yes. [Vanaja] Listen to what he says. Yeah I know, I am fond of him more than you. He’s just asking for a leg piece. Keep it whole. - You want the whole leg? Okay, I will keep the whole. [Vanaja] Go to bath after finishing this. What? [Vanaja] Go to bath after finishing this. We’ll go for that, you do your job first. Got it? - [Vanaja] Yes. Focus on your cooking now. [Sumanth] Grandma! Why are you not cooking outside now? [Vanaja] I cook here at night, because I can’t see if any fly falls in while cooking. It’s a miracle we got this rooster back! If we got the hens, then the meat would be less than this. - Yes, excatly. I can smell the fragrance. It will be prepared within 30 minutes. - Okay. After that, we’ll offer it to our ancestors and have our dinner. - Alright! Grandma, will our ancestors really eat what we offer? Maybe, even I don’t know exactly. That’s an ancient belief that whenever we do non-veg dishes... ...we have to offer it to our ancestors. But we are the ones who have to eat it. [Vanaja] Well, you kept your word by finding this rooster. That's Mahabala Shetty..! I will never give up easily. Alright, let’s go for dinner. Throw the water which is kept for offering. Alright, let’s go then. [Mahabala] Kiddo, we’ll go once she completes the ritual. - [Sumanth] Fine. Serve us some rice. First for him. Enough. Not that much, little less. Serve some chicken pieces to him. Put some more. - Enough grandma. It’s specially made for you only. - Enough! Enough! I just want a little. Kiddo, do you have to leave tomorrow itself? Yes. First, I will go Shimoga to meet some friends... ...and leave for Bengaluru. Oh is it. Make sure you call me before while coming next time. I’ll keep a fine rooster than this one. - Yes, I will call for sure. How’s this one? - Yeah, it’s delicious! Finally I fulfilled my promise you see. - Oh yeah. Eat well. Okay, you too have it. - Yeah, I am having it. It's delicious. It’s nice to have Chicken Meal with you. Do you want some more? Not now. I will ask if i need. - Okay okay.
