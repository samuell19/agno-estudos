The Heath Cobblers Film comedy in 5 acts. In Topias's vicinity lived corporal, a bachelor who liked children. The children of the village, especially cobbler's Esko and sailor Niko's little Jaana, often played. Corporal hoped that Esko and Jaana would go together all their lives. That is why he stated in his last will, that the first child to marry inherits 500 riksdaler from him. In the widely pine heath stood cobbler Topias's cabin. Years had passed. Esko has grown into stubborn, briste haired gigant, who worked at home with his shoe last. After her mother had died and her father still at sea Jaana had been taken as foster daughter at the home of cobbler Topias. Late corporal's wish had not come true and so cobbler's beefy wife, Martta, had decided to get Esko married before Jaana. "Don yourself, you oaf, for the wedding trip. I'll go see the cantor." Heath cobbler Topias himself. Esko remembers his visit to Karri, where he met Kreeta, who is the reason for Martta sending him to wedding trip now. The great rascal, Mikko Vilkastus, who jokingly suggested, that Kreeta would marry Esko. "Look, Kreeta, not just any cobbler can make a shoe like this." "Listen, Esko, she is already crazy about you." Jaana's groom, smith Kristo. Sepeteus, the respected cantor of the parish. "... and since Esko is not yet of age, we would ask cantor to come and write him a permission for wedding." "Gosh. I must hurry, for I am about to take a step, that is nothing to laugh about." "So he'll marry before us, and we'll lose 500 riksdaler." "Devil will take you for those five hundred." "What is all the ruckus down there?" "What will become of this. Esko has always been a blockhead. I remember how even as child he..." "Listen Esko, if you sit in an ant's nest for seven days, you'll become strong as an ox." "What if we gave a horse for Esko and Mikko? Walking such a trip is embarrassing for a master's son." "Embarrassing! It would be good if that's the biggest embarrassment he faces. He is of dumb breed, you see." "But this is no time to be modest, because it is a matter of 500 riksdaler." "I'm taking an important step, dad." "Listen, I'll tell you a story from the Bible:" "There was a wise man called Topias, and he had a son, who was about to go get married.." "Strange congruence. And they were both cobblers too?" "So they walked slowly, but when they finally reached a river, cried Topias's son with high voice, for a big fish..." "Mom, did you put any herrings in the bag?" "You fools, like father like son! You will get herrings with your bread." "When Heath Cobbler's Esko marries, then the whole world will topple over." "I have now - God bless us young - also gone a little crazy, me too!" "I will the text for permission, your father will sign it, and then it will be certified." "He will sign it and I will too." "But I'm the source and the beginning of this, and that is why there must be my name too." "Is it all based on your son and Mikko Vilkastus's visit to Karri?" "Not just. It was later confirmed at Halfway Tavern between me and Karri." Householder of Karri "So you send your son to get married, but remember this: it is better to stand under leaky gutter than live with a mean wife." "You are not hurrying your son to marriage just because of the late corporal's will?" "This is Martta's business, I have no claim in the matter." "Two gallant boys! Think, if you would manage to capture that big thief. Award is 700 riksdaler." "I would tie him myself! But you haven't seen me in taverns or running around throbbing at lofts. Just look at these cheeks!" "My sign needs to be there too." "My sign must be in the letter!" "You are not being wise, are you? You owl! See, that I don't give you pigs for wedding! Aye!" "Well, I'm not the one who has a score to settle and walking around like an ox with boards for eyes!" "Please forgive me, cantor, don't settle a score and don't walk around like a boar-headed ox!" Iivari, Esko's brother, who rather wanders around in village than sits by the cobbler's table. "Martta, Martta, the cantor is in our house!" "Go now with my blessings!" "We'll go like the devil was after us." "Greetings!" Iivari is sent to town for wedding shoppings. Esko wanted to stop by the first tavern. Sakeri, Iivari's uncle, a fired policeman. Sakeri lures Iivari to a pub. "I feel very touched at the moment, and my heart is like a ball of pitch on fire." "Kreeta! My head is spinning for the thoughts that soon I am one with you, and I become you and you become me, and they can call us Esko-Kreeta or Kreeta-Esko." At Karri. "Rejoice wedding room!" "We are celebrating the wedding of my foster daughter Kreeta and clog maker Jaakko." "Rejoice wedding room!" "She is beautiful like a rose in bloom, but I am silent as a perch on a stone." "When we were approaching the wedding house, we heard violin all the way to the drying barn." "Teemu is one of the best fiddlers you'll ever meet." "What about Jooseppi Oinasm?ki in our village! His playing goes to heart and kidneys, and one thinks he is in heaven." "On your wedding day I bestow you the whole Kontinkorpi area." "And I hope that in Kontinkorpi.." "May the time always pass with fortune's blessings there, until eventually you lay your head in the grave's rest, and then will the yearning tear moisten your grave. I drink to your memory." "Good Lord, my head is spinning when I think how all this would have been mine without betrayal!" "Jooseppi Oinasm?ki - the joy of heaven! Everyone is talking about music even though they understand it less than a piglet understands about silver spoon." "Jaakko, you should have become a leather cobbler." "Leather cobbler! What is a leather cobbler? Wretched pitch nose!" "That's right, sir ringmaster!" "I have heard very bad things about your handy work." "That is a lie and a slander! An angel from heaven can't make a better boot than I. Mikko can prove that." "Thank you very much! This is a nice wedding, even though.." "- but we will forgive him." "You scoundrel, you broken shoe! Just make sure you won't find yourself under the table listening to the bees." "I am Teemu!" "Yes, sir ringmaster." Teemu's father, who had forbidden his son to play at the wedding." "I'll teach him to trip." "Since the player was taken from us, let's have ouselves a happy hay harvest." "A-ha the cobbler! One thousand eight hundred, cobbler burnt the leather like thundered!" "You stole Kreeta from me, you bull calf!" "Bull calf, bull calf!" "Cobbler! Make me a pair of clogs!" "Lord in heaven protect me! This day is enough to drive a man crazy! - Jaakko!" "Deceiving me you have been all along and lured away my bride! Even you, Karri -" "It was all a joke and so I thought your father also understood that." "Wife, you have betrayed me. You have turned my flowering field into land of thistle, my wheat porridge to grainy, and now I am ashamed in front of the whole world because of you." "Come along, Mikko! I'm leaving now!" Since there was still travel money left, Mikko took Esko from village to village to visit his relatives. Iivari had it bad too. He had lost all the income from the cart load. "Can you get back the money we romped?" "Impossible! But there is another way. Hear me! On the way home, we were robbed by bandits-" "I doubt they will believe this story." Along the dusty road paced sailor Niko, Jaana's father, returning from his long journeys. "What is this? I am lay judge-" "You big scoundrel! Don't you recognize me?" "Niko! - Your daughter will be so happy to see you." "Do you have relatives there too?" In cobbler's house the welcome feast for young couple was being prepared. "I'll go borrow flour for the welcoming feast." "I wish my father was here, so we wouldn't be feeling this burning agony." Halfway Tavern. "Well if it isn't Sakeri, cobbler-Martta's brother." "Have you heard that they have seen that big thief around - spike beard and a big spot next to his nose - 700 riksdaler." "- so is that big thief ready and I get a free ride home." "Son, now we shall go home." "Never, uncle Sakeri, never home again. Now we go hang ourselves!" "Now we'll both go and hang ourselves beautifully!" "700 riksdaler!" "Law and order are strict. Show me your passport." "Tavern keeper, tavern keeper!! For God's sake bring rope and string here!" "A moment ago poor as a rat, now a seven hundred riksdalers man!" "Along that narrow road comes Esko with his young bride." "Tailor Antres, here you must wait for the wedding party, and when they arrive, you will play them honorary fanfare." "Now the question is, how dare we go home." "One thing I'd like to tell you as a secret -" "- and I have a feeling this is going to be another baton dance." "I'll pick a fight, but first I'll get you tight as a tick, so that they'll see at your home, that it wasn't just me alone who drank the money." "What do you mean? You know that nothing strong has ever touched my lips." "In that case our ways part!" "Now you have antidote in your head and everything will be smooth as oil in Lebanon when you get home." "Well, well, listen to the sound of bells now!" "Bells! Does my voice sound like a cow bell, you stupid ass!" "No bride at all." "But maybe I'll die now!" "I get wings on my back and long tail on my ass and I will rise to heights." "Earth and sky go round and round and you, tailor Antres, roll in my eyes like a monkey in the market." "I can't really hear you up here!" "Yes, this is death; and I'll get the devil's courage." "Man, you have been drinking?" "Could I be drunk? Such wonderful, such heavenly, such bravery." "Jesus Christ, Antres, shall we run our heads against a pine?" "Is a tailor a better man than a cobbler?" "How can you go in front of people with hair like that?" "The hair is fine! Feel that tuft!" "Feel for the third time!" "Goddamn! The whole world seems bewitched against me." "And there is some old quarrel between us too, Antres." "Good day. Come and see the fruits of hate and sin!" "The tailor is alive! Remarkable man! I will make you boots for free until you die." "The big thief!" "My bride was deviously given to other and I got to turn back as a bachelor." "You watch your mouth, you buzzard!" "Woman regime is a sad sign; it bodes the fall of provinces." "Don't get drunk today, if you don't want to be locked in the pigpen." "Pigpen? My little Martta, don't talk so hoggish at this festive time!" "Listen cantor! There comes Esko with his young bride. And heath roars as in wolf hunt from the villagers' greetings." "I drank everything! But here is 700 riksdaler." "Jaana, my daughter!" "He is in ropes, because he is the big thief." "What are you bragging, Topias! The thief was captured at the Vanaja church yesterday, I saw it myself." "Here, Niko, is blacksmith Kristo, fine and swift man, in love with your daughter; let him have her." "So we have lost 500 riksdaler." "You, Esko, are sued by Karri." "What do I hear? Who are you man?" "What is this crow's foot?" "Yes that is my sign." "Listen, what my daughter whispered: let us split the inheritance in two." "You dear child! Your goodness touches me more than this money." "I'm going off to sea!" "Iivari can go to sea. I will stay here and make shoes with father and shall never, never marry. What good is a wife? I know their kind now. Treacherous they are." "I built a wedding desk in our room, but it can be Kristo and Jaana's engagement table now." "I will never marry!!" Years later -- Subs by koivuhalko and joachim for KG
