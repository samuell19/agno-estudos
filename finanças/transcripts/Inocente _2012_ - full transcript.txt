This is kind of weird. [laughs] Okay. I'm thinking. Dear people of the world. Hmmm. I'm not just a girl. I'm a girl who likes to jump in puddles and likes flowers. Just because I'm homeless doesn't mean I don't have a life, because I do have a life. [music] When I paint I feel happy, so... in the morning it's a good way to start my mornings... just paint on something, and what better place than my face. When I put my makeup on and dress how I dress and I get out there, I feel confident, although I'm a really shy person. If people knew my story, they'd probably think that I should be painting dark pictures or dark paintings. With your poetry, we are going to be splitting you guys up into 3 different groups. Every student is to present today, every student has to... Kids at my school don't know that I'm homeless. If people would found out, they'd probably make fun of me, especially at the school I'm going to right now. Most of the kids are, like, really rich, with their iPod Touches, and stuff. So it's pretty sucky that I can't tell my friends. It's like keeping a secret. My name is Inocente, I'm 15-years old and I live in San Diego, California. Hi. Good morning. I pretty much grew up homeless. I've never really had something to call home. Being homeless doesn't mean you wake up on the street every day. It means always moving between shelters, friends' houses, and apartments that you get evicted from. Nothing ever feels like home. Nobody wants to be homeless. Nobody... it doesn't even come across anybody's mind. You know, "In five years I'd like to be homeless." Nobody thinks about that. I've lived in about every shelter in San Diego... The Salvation Army, the YMCA, Cortez Hill, St. Vincent De Paul, the Rescue Mission. We slept here, me and my three little brothers. My mom stayed awake and watched that nobody came near us. I don't think children should have to wake up in a park... and from that park, go to school. That's not a childhood. I didn't really have a childhood. [laughter] Go right here... yay! I think my life depends on me being an artist. I think if I don't become an artist, I probably... not just let everyone down, but mostly let myself down. There's three canvases, okay? I'm the one in the middle and the two guys next to me have already started and they're super good, and I'm just like here. [sobbing laughter] ... gonna to cry so much. You see this guy? You see this guy? You see this? [music] When I paint, I like to see things from my imagination... like weird creatures or colors. And out there in the world usually things aren't very colorful. So maybe if they were a little bit more colorful, they'd make people just a little bit more happy. [family speaking Spanish] Where we live now, it's like a really small garage. We're like, crammed in there. My mom pays rent, but we're illegal. So it's just a matter of time before she can't make enough money and we'll get kicked out and move again. [Spanish] [Spanish] I always wonder how it'd be to not have to worry about the money or... if we're gonna move out of there. I wonder how it'd be, like, to have my own room. I can't blame my mom for us being homeless. I blame myself, but it was just a simple mistake, and that's what started it all. My dad, I don't really think you could call him a dad. It is hard to describe how he looked when he was angry. It's like a bad dream. He used to hit us pretty bad. He'd hit us with the cable from the vacuum cleaner... with a tree branch... he'd find anything and he'd hit us with it. It was always bad, but there was one night where it was really bad. My dad came home from wherever he was. He told me to go tell my mom that he wanted dinner. And I completely forgot, got distracted, and started playing by the fridge with little toys. He was really upset that I didn't tell my mom, so he started beating me pretty badly to the extreme that it was just unbearable. My mom got scared that he'd probably kill me, so... ... she got in the way and... that pissed him off a little bit more. I thought they were going to kill each other. She called the police and my dad took the phone away, and... ... he broke it on her head. My mom took me and my two brothers... We just ran - It was dark and it was cold. The police came and took my dad. They deported him back to Mexico. That night we started our journey to being homeless. No matter how many people tell me that it's not my fault, I still feel like it's my fault. I felt like giving up many times in the past... to the point of suicide. But I'm still waiting for that one day... that will change my life. [music] I recently did this big canvas and I named it "The Lost Planet." And in this planet's where all the lost dreams go. I got a childhood dream of being, say, a fairy or something. And as you grow up, you mature, and you lose those dreams. So The Lost Planet's where all those lost dreams go. ♪ ♪ I have been doing art ever since I was really little. And then, like, three years ago, I was introduced to A.R.T.S. It is a place where kids come take classes, like, homeless kids, kids who are in group homes. Everybody there is basically a family. - This is going to be your show notebook. - Show notebook. - Here's your show pen. - Show pen. [giggles] Matty and Rob saw potential in me when nobody else did. - It's kinda scary. - Is it scary? - Kind of. - You love it. - You know how to create the art. - Yes. That's one step, That's about, maybe 5 or 6 steps in. This is a big deal to me. It's my first art show and probably the biggest thing I've done as an artist. ... thinking about doing some sort of 3D piece. - Yeah. - Maybe some sculpture? - It's a lot of work, how to do a show, huh? - Yeah. You're gonna have to come with a production schedule. Rob's going to be your production manager. [music] Uh, that's nasty. [Matt] Most adults couldn't handle what she's been through. She's struggling with her past holding onto her, and this is her first show and first opportunity to show the world who she is and where she's come from and to prove to herself that she's on the right path in life. She's gonna be a star. And I don't even think she's aware of how special she is. Matt has mentioned to me that there's about 200 people expected so I'm really nervous, I've never had to make this much art in my life and I don't know if my art is good enough maybe? [music] I gave my mom an invitation for my art show, but I don't know if she's coming. I wish me and my mom had a better relationship. I wish she could understand me better. [music] [music] If they could only see... The colors I carry with me are the colors of life. My love for art is endless, and endless is my joy to share with you my passion for life and its colors. Why can't you love me for who I am and play with me in the colors of life? ♪ ♪ I think I'm able to wake up positive every day because... ... every day is a new day, and it's on you to make that day good. 'Cause if you wake up negative or upset or angry, your day would probably be pretty bad. I feel the most free when I go to places all by myself, where there's not that many people and I know nobody's gonna come bother me. I like to look out the window and just dream and imagine... What if the trees could talk? Or the people had super powers? Just... What if we could walk the clouds and ride the shooting stars? But it's just a dream. I have a lot of impossible dreams, but I still dream 'em. [music] Everyone says that when you're older, you'll see how things really were And... I don't know... I don't know if I'll be able to forgive her. For the last time, I let my mom lay a hand on me. We had a pretty bad fight, and... I just decided that... she's not allowed to do that to me anymore. I'm not a little kid anymore. I can make my own decisions now. I told my mom, I want to move to Toussaint. Toussaint's different from a shelter, because it's more about teenagers, by themselves, and shelters are for families. It's really hard to get into. Living together right now is not working, correct? There's lots of stress. If Inocente just runs away, that's not good - to live on the street. We don't want that, nobody wants that. Foster care... I don't think that's good either, for a lot of different reasons, You're still a family. Toussaint Academy enables her to go live someplace, relieve the stress, and still have a relationship. Inocente is very anxious to do what's right for her and for the whole family and not to just leave altogether. Would you give her that chance? Are you okay? She need to go for..., because it's too very, very stressful for she live right here, and two little brothers. [laughs] [mellow folk music] It takes days for everything to get ready. Sometimes we stay at A.R.T.S, me, Rob, and Matt... ... till like, 10, because we have to get everything ready. Rob, why aren't you helping? It's a two-ton cow. [laughter] - Yeah. - All right. ♪ ♪ I think it's really important for me see my paintings, because some of them do hold a story. People should know there's a story, it's not just a painting. ♪ ♪ [tense music] ♪ ♪ If you want your dreams to come true, you have to make them come true. It's Inocente's brand they're buying.

Of all the art galleries in San Diego, this many people are coming here tonight to see a 15-year-old girl's work.

If you couldn't dream, it's like not having a purpose. So when you dream it's like you want to get that dream accomplished.

I keep having this dream... it feels so real, and it's pretty crazy. I remember being on the beach, and... it was really, really hot, but I like the hot. And I'm pregnant and I'm with my husband. I don't have a husband... but in my dream, I knew he was my husband because I could feel that he loved me. I walked to the ocean and I realized that my husband tied a string around my wrist. In case I got scared, he would pull me back. It was a really, really pretty, like clear blue... like pool water blue. Then this really big, beautiful whale comes swimming towards me. It was scary, but for some reason, I felt really safe. I don't turn back... Its huge body moves right past me... and disappears into the deep blue. And I'm okay. ♪ ♪ [laughter] See, that's silly. If I didn't have silly dreams, I'd be totally, totally depressed, 'Cause although those dreams are silly, they're like... they're fun, and... just imagining how would it be like - it's pretty exciting. subtitles: Iladi Elladi
