You can't be here. -He was just helping me-- -Aden! -[man] I only want-- -Now please leave! -I only wanted to-- -[Sarah] Stop! I asked you to leave. Now get off my land. You mean... his land?

Jordan, your wife is as compassionate as always. -Damn right. -Mm-hmm. Hey, so, uh, how's Aden doing? [Sarah] I wish I knew. I'm gonna go get us some more wine. Sarah, hold up. We should really get to work. Hey, I wouldn't say no to more wine. Wine she found in exchange for days of cleaning. -[Jordan] Babe. -[Liam] Hey, come on. It feels like I'm back in the Navy. Liam, you were an officer. The only thing you had to keep clean were those fancy rank boards and your choker whites. Well, can we, like, go look for Aden or something? He'll be back when he's ready.

[woman] You will come to love and trust the family... as we all have. [all] For the family. [soft chatter] Are you nervous, young [indistinct]? A little. There's no reason to be. Your time preparing was well spent. We've arranged everything. Though, we were disappointed to have a few unforeseen ends to tie up. I'm sorry, I-- didn't know my aunt Madelyn was coming. Or the girl. Other arrangements have been made for your guest of honor. Aden. Your father would be proud. [cult leader] Young [indistinct]. Your life as a member of this family resumes now. Your mother tried to weaken you. She did not succeed. I will not fail the family. Prove it. [Aden] Hey, big shooter. Aden? What's going on? I'm joining my true family now. [Liam grunts] [outdoor ambiance] [grunting] Aren't you glad you could help me do that? [knife squelches, bone crackles] [Liam pants, grunts] [blood dripping, coughs] I saw you kiss her. -Aden. You all right? -Aden. Help us. Aden, honey? Aden, what the hell? [Aden] Hi, Mom. I know you tried. You've always wanted what you thought was best for me. And for the longest time... I was afraid I'd... never be the man Dad wanted me to be. Who gives a shit about him? She's your mother. Stay out of my family's business! You show up uninvited to what? Huh? Steal me from my family again? Aden, let us go. You let us go or-- Please, please. -[Maddy] Sarah! Sarah! -[Sarah] No! Maddy! -[Maddy screams] -[Sarah] Maddy! No! [screams] Maddy! Maddy! -[Maddy screams] -[thudding] [Sarah whimpers] [Sarah sobs] Family doesn't give up... that easily, Mom. Family doesn't run away. Family also forgives... Mom. -Aden, no-- -[Aden] Mom. They're forgiving me for you. For Dad. And I couldn't have done it without your help. Thank you. -[Sarah cries] -[Aden] Hey, hey. Hey, hey, it's okay. You brought me back. You did everything you could. Now... Liz and I will pick up... where you and Dad left off. Aden, you can't. Aden. Don't do that to that girl. No, Aden, just look at yourself. [Aden exhales] No. Aden, Aden, Aden, Aden. -It's almost over. -[Sarah cries] [Sarah whimpers] [women singing in distance] -Let's go. -Wait! -We need to think about this. -We can't wait. What? Jordan, no! Wait. Jordan, wait. [singing continues] [Rachel screams] -Liz! -Liz! Help! [Rachel screams] [banging] [body thuds] Are you okay? I'm fine, it's nothing. [pants] [Rachel grunts] [Jordan] Rachel. What's wrong? You just shouldn't have revealed your secrets. -[Jordan cries] -Don't. Go save our daughter. I love you. I love you, too. [singing continues] [Liz screaming] No, no, no, no, no, no! [singing continues] [blood squirts] [Jordan pants] Aden. Where's Liz? [Aden] You fought very hard. You could have escaped, if you'd just left Liz alone. She's my daughter! Where is she? -She's safe. -What did you do to her? She's part of my family now. Don't worry. In all the generations we farmed this land, we've never had a poor harvest. You're gonna make an excellent hunt this year. Your blood will fertilize the lands that feed your daughter. [banging on cage] A mother's place is to sacrifice for her children. Don't you think? [chanting in foreign language] [chanting continues] [chanting continues] We begin this year's ceremony with a renewed sense of joy... knowing that our family will once again be complete. Tonight, we restore our lost son to his rightful place. Our forefathers, they knew that the sacrifice of one's life for another is the greatest show of devotion that man can reach. Thus, we've always honored the tradition of the [indistinct]. [melancholic orchestral music playing] On this night... your father gives his life for you. [woman] Now... honor your father's sacrifice. [Aden] Praise the family! I present to you our first sacrifice, representing planting, the first seed and hope. May his blood fertilize our lands. [axe thuds] For the planting! [all] For the planting! After the planning... the seed grows and is nourished and the weeds... that threaten the sprouting plants... must be ripped from the earth. [sighs] As the sacrifices of our ancestors cultivated this land... so too will yours. I remove this weed that has choked our family. -[stabbing] -[Sarah screams] [Sarah] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [Aden] For the cultivation! [all] For the cultivation! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The harvest must be reaped. The wheat separated from the chaff. [Sarah whimpers] [Aden] For the harvest! [all] For the harvest! [Sarah pants] I'm not going anywhere. [blood squelches] The harvest ceremony is complete. We now join Elder [indistinct]... in welcoming his bride.

With your commitment to the family... and to our future... I bind you in love and protection of the seven families. I bless your thoughts. May they be pure... and wise. I bless your bodies. May they be strong to serve the family. Lastly, I bless your lips. May only praise... ever be uttered from them.
