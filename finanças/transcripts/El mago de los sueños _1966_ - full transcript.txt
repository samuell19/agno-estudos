Hands off! or you will damage it. Do you think it bites? Fluffy, I give it to you in exchange for two cards! A little more respect, you guys! Listen up! He is saying things. Hey! That's a little man! This little thing? It must be a leprechaun that has escaped from some fairy tale. There are no such things as leprechauns! A leprechaun is a helicopter? Isn't it mine? I have found it. Mom! Mom! Enough! Quiet! We must let him do the talking! You are very kind! Now, why don't you tell me how you stay out of the bed? Fluffy woke me up! That's a lie! It's true, he woke me up too. Don't touch it, it's mine! Who are you, sir? What do you mean who am I? Enough of this! Go to bed! A little respect in front of a wizard! Spoiled kids! Are you a wizard? You are too small. Yes! Is there anything wrong with being short? Look! He changes his color and his voice, he is a wizard for sure! - Leo! Come to bed! - Fluffy, no! The best thing to do is to leave! You are going to stain my colors! Don't let it out, it's a butterfly! Butterfly me? Don't go Mr. Wizard... Don't go away. Please do not leave. Please forgive us. None of that! I'm leaving! If you are a wizard, why don't you do some tricks for us? Tricks you say? I'm Wizard of Dreams, young man. Wizard of Dreams? Yes, when good children sleep, I come to tell them fairy tales. And why don't you tell a story now? Yes, that's what I came here for, but... - But? - You should all be asleep! I'm going to bed then! Like this?! Yes, for a moment I thought I was in the wrong place. Oh boy, the Telerin brothers! Well, back to work! Quiet! I'm Wizard of Dreams and here I am! To tell all the little ones stories of kindness, How nice is to dream! With magic and fantasy, and the stars reach out. I'm Wizard of Dreams I'm flying by stars and paths of color! Carrying the illusion, in dreams, Poetry, as a walking troubadour! I am the Wizard, I am your friend I transform myself to make you very happy! and in the silence, while you sleep, my friends the elves will make you smile, I'm Wizard of dreams, I'm flying by stars and paths of color! Carrying the illusion! At the dawn, you will wake up happy! At the dawn... you will wake up happy! At the dawn, you will be very happy! He is mine! Fluffy! I'm Wizard of Dreams! Why did you do that to him! He's a Wizard! Did he kill him? Look at this! The cup is moving! Let us pretend to sleep! Such naughty children! They have finally gone to sleep. It's better this way. Let's see, where's Cuqu?n? Cleo...? Tails? Of course... sure... yeah! I don't get you! He is very little, he does not speak yet, he just says Da-Da. I'm scared... Quiet! Go to sleep now! No! No that way Mr. Wizard! If he doesn't have the pacifier, he won't fall asleep! Of course! Fair enough! There you go! What else does he need to fall asleep? - A new pacifier! - Another one? No sir, just a couple of them. You mean three pacifiers? That's right, the first one he's ever had, then the broken and lastly, the one my father bought him! He bought it for him one night at 2 am! Because he wouldn't go to sleep. I am a good kid... Cuqu?n is not! Mr. Wizard, will you sing him a lullaby? - No! -Well then, he won't fall asleep. Cleo! I must go pee! Please turn the light on! When will you shut up? I can't work this way! Mr. Wizard, will you sing him the lullaby? Mama sings to him like this: Go to sleep my child, the cow is coming, to eat your ass because it has poop... What did you say, child!? Well you've been warned, nite! Go to sleep... Sleep now, A dream has come... Jumping and hopping Cuqu?n is happy! And everyone greets him, singing in chorus! Cuqu?n was the little one, the smallest in size but very cheerful plays, both in winter and summer, flowers and birds have seen him play, Despite being happy in his little world, He always wants to help, but it is small and will only fail! Cuqu?n was the little one, the smallest in size And he remains sad, in winter and summer, He wanted to go to school, but he failed again! Poor Cookin! What happens to him? He wants to be like his siblings so he can go to school. And thus help his parents. Of course he can't, he cannot! he's so tiny... And he already wants to learn numbers and letters Oh, boy! What a kid! Don't be sad, Cuqu?n! I'll give you some advice, your efforts deserve to be rewarded! Tonight, when all is quiet, approach the books, with this illusion, and perhaps they will give you the secret of their knowledge. Nice idea! Terrific idea! And you won't run the risk of being mistaken for a fly! Of course! Great idea! Cuqu?n was determined to follow the advice of the wise old snail. In the calm of the night, he approached the books, ready to learn so many things, just like his siblings. A... B... C... D... E! One, two and three! We would like to introduce ourselves We want you to get to know us, Know that I am the "A". And I'm "C"! We want you to know what the "E" looks like. E... one, two, three! Four... five... six! Seven, eight, nine and ten. We would like to introduce ourselves We want you to get to know us, That one plus one equals two. We want you to learn that five plus five equals ten. We want to teach you... We want to show you... That if you learn to read and count, you will succeed in life! * Now I can read * What a joy! He learned letters and numbers. But how can this be? Even so, they continued to ignore him. Even though he already knew how to read and write. Quiet, Cuqu?n, don't make a fuss. Your father has fallen ill. Yes, I know your wish is to help me, but you are still so tiny... Your father will not be able to go to the forest today, so you will have to go and gather firewood. Take care of yourselves, don't go too far away! He did not intend to be left behind, now that he had learned as much as his siblings. Although small, he could help. * Danger! Ferocious ogre. * Hidden by fallen leaves, he discovered a sign on the road, they were in the domain of the fierce Ogre! Maybe just a few steps away, Something was moving over there! It was his closest friend, the grasshopper! He must hurry to meet his siblings. they calmly cut firewood without being alerted to the danger! * To the forest * (left) * Forest shortcut * (right) Cuqu?n knew the way and was safe from the rain, It didn't take him long to reach the mansion of the fierce Ogre. An Ogre who loved cooking and eating! There was nothing to fear, Cuqu?n had learned many things, and he was willing, not only to use his knowledge, but also to have a lot of fun. Good! Now let's cook the sauce. Sauce for one, two, three, four and five! I have a lot of them! One, two, three, four and...! I could swear there were five of them! Have I miscounted? Is it hunger that makes me wrong? The siblings had already noticed Cuqu?n's arrival. And they wanted to join in the fun. They were going to cause a great deal of confusion! Thus, the Ogre who was very precise in cooking recipes, made a mess of things! Ingredients... Four eggs. Two cucumbers. Four eggs! Uh?! Two cucumbers, three carrots, Five lettuce... Another tomato! Split in half! One quarter... two eighths of cucuberrys. I mean... of cucumbers! A pinch of... I don't understand anything! Four pears... Seven pears... One... two... five garlics... Or was it five onions? I'm sure I didn't pay attention to it! Cuqu?n was determined to make a mess of the Ogre's feast. With the help of his companion, the grasshopper, They made mischief after mischief, to distract the Ogre so that the children could escape. Cuqu?n managed to confuse the Ogre, who ended up babbling. I feel like my tongue is dirty, as well as a high fever! I, a donkey! The siblings, taking advantage of all the food in the pantry, were able to escape the Mansion. But they didn't notice that Cuqu?n was still in there. Go on! Hurry up! But he was in no danger, quite the contrary! He managed to convince that he, Cuqu?n, was the conscience of the Ogre! That is how he managed to kill him. And in the meantime, he had him chop wood to take to his father. Two! Three! If I have six trees and I cut one... how much do I have now? Twelve... I guess! No... I think it's five of them... Five, five! Five... of course! Cuqu?n was the smallest, but only small in size, and cheerful he plays, in winter and in summer time, flowers and birds have always seen him play! Everything seemed peaceful, but out there a threat to my job was brewing. Mr. Coco, Dream Destroyer, was about to enter! This was going to puzzle everyone! - I am guarding my domain! - What are you saying? - Are you kidding? - Back off, Commoner! Dare not offend the honor of my sword! Out of nowhere, Pepe, possessed by a strange force, he charged like a warrior and was about to give me a thrust! What's wrong with this kid! Have no fear, Mr. Wizard, he's a bit of a sleepwalker, He talks in his sleep. A sleepwalker? - Get back, you coward! - Watch out, mindless! - Stand up for yourself! - Stop this kid! He always dreams that he is a hero! Mom says not to tell him anything, and let him talk. Back off, Blackbeard! - Fight back if you can! - Shall we all play, Pepe? Child, I tell you to be careful! I am Pepe Hood, guardian of the forest! Hit them hard! If Mom comes upstairs, there will be a huge mess! But it does me some good to be a wizard, Wizard of Dreams! I was able to calm the situation by conjuring a soothing dream! Get back, you coward! Get back! Beyond the seas, in a enchanting castle, dwells the ferocious tax collector! He who is content with gold, and whose account increases, Treasures heaps, full of delight! People groan and weep, with misery and fear. All because of the ferocious tax collector! I am the bravest, I am the little dreamer! Yes, yes, yes, yes, this little one certainly has great courage! I am a knight! I do not stand injustice, I am the little dreamer! He does not tolerate injustice, He is fearsome and invincible! Strike like lightning! He is the little dreamer! Ride, troy and fly as a brave defender! Tireless, he always comes to the defense of the weak. He never hesitates, he is all fury and bravery! Against evil he fights, He is the little dreamer! Go ahead boy! Against evil, wield your sword! Your good name echoes, little achiever! Royal Treasury Royal Armor Royal Kitchen Royal Treasury I am the bravest! I am a little dreamer. Yes, yes, yes, yes, this little one certainly has great courage! I'm a real knight! I do not tolerate unfairness, I am the little dreamer! He does not tolerate injustice, He is fearsome and invincible! Strike like lightning! He is the little dreamer! He never hesitates, he is all fury and bravery! Against evil he fights, He is the little dreamer! Go ahead boy! Against evil, wield your sword! Your good name echoes, little achiever! - But you have crushed him! - No, Cleo, it's all fantasy. It is but a dream. Your little brother sleeps peacefully, watch! In spite of my best efforts, Dream Destroyer was still determined to ruin my night. Thank God Marip?'s dog scared him so much, prevented him from sneaking into the kid's room. It's my doggy, dolphin! He just woke up. It is no longer time to talk, it is late. It doesn't matter! He loves dreams, he also enjoys playing and running and jumping, because he is very good. Marip? loved her dog very much. The dog spent all day playing with his colorful ball, in a fabulous mansion. He was a very clean little dog, He didn't even know about fleas. But one day, when the gate was open, doggy curiosity led him to discover a new world. Why things happen, you never know. Wait until I scratch myself. I don't understand how there are dogs that don't scratch. A few fleas are good, they help with physical exercise, and to keep muscles in shape. Ah! To be a dog one must have fleas. And while you scratch, you forget the hunger. I don't understand why some dogs, just to have a free bone, accept daily bathing! And staying cooped up at home without seeing the world. And always with a fake smile and a silly woof woof. All this makes no sense. Only what is natural is real. Do you remember Paco, the thin one? The other day I ran into him on the street, then he asked me to give him one of my bugs! The poor guy had a very bored look on his face! The crazy life of stray dogs, and the arrival of the dog catchers, caused their inseparable jumping fleas to fall off their backs. For a dog, a fine bone is enough. To be a dog, you have to have fleas. How pleasant it is, scratching your back... Cute doggy, if happiness has not come to you, you have to become a great scratcher! To be a dog you must have fleas. To be a dog you have to be a stray. Oh, what a delight to be a dog, scratch your back! Oh, my dears, how nice of you to come and visit me! You both look gorgeous with those new necklaces! You look very young! It is true! Oh, how nice you are! Doesn't this new casual hairdo suit me? It's the latest fashion! Did you notice the last "tail" of the season? It is really beautiful! Of course, honey! And it's about time to take our juicy bone. What a great host! Look, here comes my little nephew. How handsome! Hello beautiful, what's your name? How old are you? Woof! Charming! He is very chatty. But what did this boy say! That he has a flea! And that day, in addition to fleas, he discovered female nervousness... And all because of a tiny flea who was very playful and who took every opportunity to run away and play hide-and-seek with their new guest. Let's go to bed, we must rest! So that tomorrow we get up early. He couldn't understand that his games were causing such a fuss. Until he got himself kicked out of the house. Now that he was living the dog's life, For good. He already sensed that his was a mocking and unwelcome flea. That alone explained so many heartaches. Hmm, it would be better to get rid of it. What are you doing, you fool? You should never despise your fellow flea. Remember that the flea and its scratching, make the dog. Besides, those poor fleas have only us. This youth that only thinks of biting a bone! Nice dog, if you have not achieved happiness, to you... you must be quite a dog, but without fleas... no no no no no! To be a dog you must have fleas, To be a dog, you must be a stray. How amazing it is to be a dog! To see the world! And to enjoy! When Marip? was having a sweet dream, with Cleo and Fluffy's peace of mind, someone so unpleasant made his appearance.... Look Mr. Wizard, a Martian! No! He's not a Martian, He is Mr. Coco, Dream Destroyer! Mr. Coco! Mr. Wizard, should I call Mom? There is something unusual here... Mr. Coco, I think you are in the wrong house. All of these children have been good, so that you are not needed here! Tell me kid, isn't Fluffy your name? Yes... yes. So, I'm here because this kid deserves to have a nightmare! No! No! I don't understand! Give me the list, Ring-Ring! Ring-Ring! Come on, I must get this straight! Read the list to me! Err... Cleo... A in kindness! Marip?... also an A! Pepe: A in studies! What is it! Fluffy F in behavior? How come?! I need to clear this up now, young man! I didn't do anything bad. So, why did you get an F in behavior? Mom doesn't want you to lie! You see, Mr. Wizard, he behaved a little bit badly. He broke his piggy bank to buy a water pistol. I only shoot cats! And why didn't you warn me? Now my hands are tied! What will happen Mr. Wizard? Mr. Coco has come to punish his bad behavior! He is going to have a terrible nightmare! You traitors! If you want proof that this child is bad, Here it is! This is the evidentiary material! Mr. Wizard, he promised not to misbehave again. Please do not leave. That man is evil. I'm sorry, Cleo... Fluffy has already apologized! He says he will not break anything again without my parents knowing. You will have a hard time! Without the cheesy dreams of this... small time Wizard! No offense, Don Coco, no offense! Get out! I am at work! Oh, yeah? I regret to inform you that fluffy is not as bad as you think! He is under my power. My nightmare is summoned! You will be a poor child! Poor! And you will have to work, work and work! You will serve an evil and greedy master! That will not let you rest! You will yearn to be able to buy toys, to play with your friends, but there will be no rest in your labor! And no toys either! One day, the master will give you a coin, but it will be counterfeit money! Your love of toys will be your doom! Because when you pay with your counterfeit coin... you will be jailed! Don Coco, who had gotten his way, could only be fought with my wizard powers. Fluffy is a good boy... most of the time... that's why I became a magic rat! That's how I was able to sneak into jail. So I enter your dreams, whistling. Here you are whistling... And thus a miracle you will perform, whistling. Whistling. their sound. To the sound of a whistle, Fuffy got the counterfeit coin to grant his wishes. A world of magic, whistling, no things are impossible, whistling, so the sadness will fade away, forever, whistling, their sound. Whistling. so the sadness will fade away, forever... whistling... their sound. The greedy master, who was none other than Mr. Coco, guided by his boundless ambition, disguises himself as a beggar to exploit Fluffy's kindness, by asking for charity. He hoped Fluffy would take pity, and give him the marvelous coin. Mr. Coco, I mean! The greedy, wanted to increase his wealth. But Mr. Coco's whistle didn't had magic in its notes. And so, for being ambitious, got just the opposite. A fair punishment! Mr. Coco, angry about his failures, got furious! made a real storm! so loud that it was heard by mom Teler?n! What's all the fuss about! I'll go upstairs right now! A mother? I am done! The breakout was so unexpected, and caused so many blows, that we would probably not hear from him again for a long time. But, an opportunity came for Cleo. Oh, a flying saucer! Without realizing it, and without any effort simply soared to the stars, all the way up to fantasy space, there she reached a dream, simple and fun, next to a new playmate. You will fly to the top in a flying saucer! You will fly among clouds and colored stars You will leave behind sad flowers in a world of emotions. you will carry through the galaxies messages of love. You will fly to the top in a flying saucer! *Nonsense phrases* Flying saucer! Flying saucer! You will fly to the top In a Flying saucer! You will fly through space, spreading your love. I will dream, like in fairy tales, a promising future. You will fly to the top In a Flying saucer! With the magical twinkling of the stars, the night was advancing in the middle of a silence almost total silence. How wonderful are children when they sleep. I'm getting a little hoarse. Good evening, lady! Good evening, sir. Captain! At your service! Mr. Duck! - How is the family doing? - Quak! Quak! Mr. Bear! Please to see you. The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Wizard. How are you? Oh, boy! We have an artist on stage! That's mine! What a distraction! With so many toys around, I had forgotten about Tails! What?! This little girl should not already be asleep? Asleep...? Why? You dummy! If she is awake, they will not be able to tell her a dream. What is a dream? Err... a dream is... Is like a... Like a fairytale! I know the story of Little Red Riding Hood! Red Riding-Hood? Shut up! Let's hear the story! Want to hear the story of Little Red Riding Hood? Yeah. Once upon a time, it used to happen... That the mom... And then came Little Red Riding Hood, She was not very obeying because when passing by the forest, Then... Then, they would give her a little basket... What was in the basket? A medication for grandma. Where did grandma live? Not far. Close by. In the forest, right? And what happened to the wolf? He was going through the forest, He was going through the forest... She didn't obey because she crossed through the forest... Her mother told her: Don't go through the woods because you might run into the wolf. And she didn't obey because... Because she was passing through the forest.... And there... Well, there... And out came the wolf... And then she said... Aren't you going to enter the house? The wolf was coming, because he was big... And then came granny, Then came Little Red Riding Hood, She knocked on the door, And out there was the wolf, Then, she opened the door! And Little Red Riding Hood came, And he ate the granny.... And then to the Little Red Riding Hood... And she said, "Why do you have such huge eyes?" For a better look you! Such big ears you have! They are for... talking on the phone! And why do you have such big nose? To blow my nose better! Why is your mouth so big? To better eat you! And he ate her! Did I tell the story well? Oh, my toy has fallen off! It has broken a bit! Don't cry, don't cry! It's nothing, it's nothing! Shut up! Look what's on your head! A rabbit! Pigeons! The Circus is here! It has arrived, it is here! Oh, it's the circus! Let's applaud! Go ahead, children, the fantasy will soon begin! Come in! Come on in! Come in! I invite you all to dream To dream! To dream! I want to dream! I want to laugh! And in the circus play! The circus is for laughter and fun! It is the dream of a seal and a clown, that achieved success! Let's go! No! No! That's enough, that's the last straw! I don't want the seal to be on the boat! But in the sea! The poor seal has been hurt and can't swim! The poor seal has broken its leg! And the risk is to drown at sea! Sorry! I repeat what I said! The poor seal is wounded! Okay... it stays there! Let's not argue anymore, anymore! At the next port it will stay. Thanks Cap! You are an angel! If you order it, it will stay in the city! What a useless clown! Your failure is unacceptable! No-no-no-no-no! You are done! I demand that people enjoy an original clown! It's ruining my business! In the circus ring should no longer be. I can't hold on a minute longer If you don't have a good idea, you will leave the circus, Renew your ideas Surprise us! Don't forget that tonight The crowd must acclaim you. I hope you achieve succeed in the circus ring And now I'm out of here, the show is about to start! Ladies and Gentlemen, Gino, the Great! What is he doing? He's a clown! The sad clown, to repeat one of his distant nights of triumph, He drew on all his skills and abilities. Poor little clown, his efforts were useless, felt the weight of failure, the loneliness, in the middle of a horrible silence. What to do? How to make people laugh again? Abandoning the circus was unacceptable. The audience is impatient and you must not disappoint them, Borrow happiness, new resources, from the good clowns, if you don't want to fail. Imagine the laughs, remember that tonight is your last call. Renew your ideas, Fascinates the audience, Don't forget to be acclaimed! The joy of the circus does not wait, you must act now! He had to try again. He would not give up without trying everything! Lucky you! The last thing missing was the unexpected appearance of a baby seal. Unwelcome visit! It was going to ruin his last efforts! An unexpected win for the couple! Well, fate had brought them together, fate had made them friends, from now on his work would be successful. A happy horizon, and would bring joy to many. And so the dream ends, with the couple succeeding. Well, let's see... Let's see... Tails and the seal. Cuqu?n... Fluffy. Marip? and her dog. And Cleo. How nice to see them so calm. I will be back another night, because they, even naughty, they will remain good. We must leave everything in place, before resuming the trip, and visit many other children, to tell them dreams... yes, many dreams... THE END
