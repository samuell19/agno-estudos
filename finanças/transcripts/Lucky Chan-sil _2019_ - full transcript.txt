Film is not about numbers. It's not about one or two stars. Film is about... Hands in or you're out, rock, paper, scissors! Again! Hands in or you're out, rock, paper, scissors! - Rock, paper, scissors! - Go again! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! YOON SEUNG-AH BAE YU-RAM - Drink, drink! - Drink, drink! Drink up! No beer allowed. - Soju! - Okay, fine. YOUN YUH-JUNG KIM YOUNG-MIN You pick one person who fits the description. The person with the most picks has to drink. You can't let someone else drink for you. KANG MAL-GEUM Sir? Director Ji? WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KIM CHO-HEE LUCKY CHAN-SIL I'm tired. - Let's rest here for a bit. - Okay. Producer Lee, even a delivery truck wouldn't be able to come up this road. I'm finished. I'm doomed. Don't say that. Director Ji may be gone, but you still have us. You'll get back on your feet. You can do it. Here we are. - Be careful. - Good. You're here. - Hello. - Hi. - Say hello to my landlady. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Welcome. - The room on the right. - Okay. I'll get the door. Not that room! That isn't the one. Don't go in there! - I'm sorry. - Sorry, ma'am. - The door at the end! - Okay. - I got the door. - Okay. - Come and help me. - I'll take those. Careful there. Your landlady... - Doesn't she seem creepy? - Creepy? The way she frets over that room, as if there's something about it. True. Makes you want to peek inside, doesn't it? Not really. Yes? - Sis! - Sophie! Sophie is here. - Hi, Sophie. - Sis! Don't make such a fuss just because she's an actress. Let me have a look at you. You're all skin and bones. - I lost 5kg. - 5kg? This is really upsetting me. - This house is... - Isn't it strange? - It feels like a basement. - And it's shaped weird. The house is fine. The air is nice here, though. Want me to show you? Wow. I can see everything from up here. Sis. This crisp mountain air should help you get back on your feet. I can see my house, too. Hi. Does it look like me? "The Seven Colors of the Peacock." You're here. - Are you shooting a new movie? - Yeah. - I play a peacock. - A peacock? Yeah. It's about a bird chasing its dreams. And I'm the bird. Isn't it perfect? - Your place is a mess. - Right? My cleaning lady quit. - She fell and broke her leg. - Sheesh. I can't do anything without her. Dear God, bestow upon me a new cleaning lady! Now you're even learning French? More like alcohol. I'm learning how to make rice wine. You're a master chef, not an actress, huh? You don't think I'm an actress? Don't start again! I'm the one that's in a mess, not you. I have to make a living, but no one will hire me. - But you're fantastic. - That's what you think. I can barely pay the bills. I need every penny I can get. - I can lend you money. - No. I have to work for it. Who is it? - Who are you? - What? - I'm the French teacher. - French? Hello. - You're the French teacher? - Yes. And you're... I'm the new cleaning lady. - The cleaning lady. - Yes. - Is Sophie inside? - She went to her guitar lesson. Oh. Then... I guess I should come back later. Hang on a minute. One minute. She's not picking up. She must be in her lesson. When will she be back? Please wait a little longer. She'll come running soon when she remembers. She'll suddenly remember and come running from her guitar class. - You seem to know her well. - She's a close friend. I used to be a movie producer, but everything went down the drain. I see... I'm teaching French for the time being, but I'm actually a short film director. - You're a filmmaker? - Yes. A filmmaker... I see. I teach French on the side to make a living. - Did you live in France? - Yes, I studied there. - You studied there? - Yes. I'm sorry! I completely forgot. I was playing the guitar and when I remembered, I threw it and came running. I'm so sorry. I told you, didn't I? I'll introduce you two. Kim Yeong makes short films and teaches me French. Lee Chan-sil is my friend who's like a sister to me. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Ow! It felt like current was flowing through my hand. I wonder why. Static electricity, perhaps? Static electricity? Seriously? Yes? I'm going home, Sophie. It's that late already? We should wrap up, too. Oh no. Then I must be late for pole dance lessons! Bye, guys. She can never keep still except for when she's sleeping. - Shall we? - Sure. You must be working on a screenplay these days. Since you're a short film director. How did you know? Ask any would-be director what they're doing. They're almost always writing, not actually filming. And "the world keeps turning," as they say. Is your script coming along nicely? Yes. What kind of films did you work on? I doubt you would've heard of them. I watch a lot of independent films. Give me a title. I'd rather not. That makes me more curious. Why did you quit working in film? - I'm going this way. - I'm that way. We pray to the heavens. Watch over our film shoot. Let everyone be safe from harm. Let our efforts come together on the screen. Let our hearts be one. By Director Ji Myeong-su, "I Dwell in the Hills." "I Dwell in the Hills" Prayer Ceremony That's amazing, Director Ji! Thank you. Let's work hard. Thank you, all. And Madam Park. - Let's go now. - Bring some wet tissues. - I'm leaving. - Already? I have a busy schedule. We'll make sure to clean up before we go. Of course, you will. I have a good feeling about this one. It'll be a hit. Thank you for your kind words and lending us this office. Director Ji's movies are great and I'm happy to help. And you're the best producer I've seen around. You're a real gem, you. The hidden gem of Korean cinema! Let's give it our best. You got it. - We'll have so much fun. - It'll be great. Rock, paper, scissors! Let's take a break. I'm about to pass out. You're drinking like there's no tomorrow. Who has the most beautiful heart? - Don't pick me. - It's... One, two, three! It's just your excuse to work me to death. You think I don't know that? Which of us here... Had the most affairs? One, two, three! Director! It's unanimous! Wow. What a spectacular performance! - He's just putting on a show. - I don't think he is. - Are you all right, sir? - Director Ji? - What do we do? - Sir! Director Ji! Why are you following me? Just because. I felt like I should. Even though I may never end up marrying, I thought that I'd always make movies... This situation came all too suddenly that I can't hold myself together. Is the director's death torturing you that much? Yes. I thought I'd make movies forever with the people I cherished. Are you spending the night at my house? Of course. I'll just lie beside you. Nothing more. Really? Then can you hold me tight? What was your name again? It's Yeong. Kim Yeong. Yeong. I haven't held a man in a decade! Hold me tighter! Really tight. Ow. It hurts if you hold me that tight. I must be losing my marbles... - Aren't you cold? - Huh? It's cold! Go back in. Okay. Aren't you cold? Sorry. There's a lot to recycle, huh? Are you learning to be a bartender now? Oh, because there are too many different types of drinks? I hate mixing drinks, but I easily get sick of just one type. That's mixing drinks. You should cut back. I don't drink the whole bottle. I can't watch this! Get yourself a date or something. Like that's easy. Do you have French today? That's next week. I have rice wine lessons today. Why? Do you like Yeong? How could I? I've only seen him once. Dating will take your mind off everything else. I haven't dated in ages. I just don't see it happening. That's because you were so busy with work. Damn it! Why did I slave my youth away? How old is he? Yeong? Thirty-three? Maybe thirty-five? All I know is that he's younger than he looks. How old are you now? Forty. Forty? Drop everything! I'll do it. Hello? Yes, Madam Park. Sure. Huh? Yeong? Did I conjure him up now? What's the matter? It seems there are still mosquitoes in this cold. - What brings you here? - I'm meeting someone. There she is. I'm not delusional. Good. Madam Park? Thank you so much for reaching out to me. No worries. I've been meaning to catch up with you. Are those leeks? They're huge. Sweetie. I've given it much thought, and I don't think it's a good idea to bring you on board. Right. I know better than anyone how hard you've worked. But we have to face reality, so don't take it personally. - What is reality? - Huh? Do I have to point it out to you? Yes. Point it out, please. Director Ji's artistic works revolve around his brand of cinema. His films are unique works of art. You see? In other words, those films would've still been created even without you taking part in it. Do you get that? No, I don't. You don't? You poor thing. You don't understand? What was your job on set? - A producer. - That's right. Producers don't matter on films like that. Madam Park. You never saw the kinds of things I had to do. Don't yell. This is why you never work with just one director! You should own up to your choices! Dear me... That bitch. Like she knows anything about film. Producer Lee! You left these. Thank you. Hi, ma'am. - Where are you coming from? - Pardon? Are you coming from work? - I don't work. - Then what do you do? - Bits of this and that. - This and that? What did you do before? - I was a producer. - Huh? - A movie producer. - What's that? Someone who manages money, assembles crews and such. - So what does a producer do? - Sorry? I don't really know anymore. It must be a strange job if you can't even explain it to me. I'll just pretend I understood. Even the landlady is on my case today. Hello? Yeah, Mom. No, I'm fine. Dad sent me a letter? To which address? No, I didn't get it. I'll look for it. Cha... Cha... The last... T-I-M-E... To Bu... Busan... Wait, this isn't for me... Wait... I can say... N-O-W... Goddamn it! Why are there so many alphabets in the letter? Oh dear. I'm sorry. I thought it was mine. I'm awfully sorry. That's okay. Good night. Sophie. You can breathe. I have to keep still, not you. Like she even reads this. "Be present and you will be true." "Wherever you may be," "be your own master," "and you will find truth in all your surroundings." We're leaving soon. Sorry I forgot about the screening. Can I just go outside and clean? It's too stifling in here. No. You know how much they like to gossip. There will be rumors going around. Did you really read this and underline it? Read what? I don't know. Anyway, just keep still and wait here. We'll be out very soon. Are you done? Almost. - Your makeup looks amazing today. - Really? Thank you. That lady we saw... Wasn't she the producer of "Silver Axe, Golden Axe"? Oh, you saw her? - She just dropped by. - So it was her. - She looked so bony. - She must've had a hard time. It's so sad, right? Her only wish was to live one day longer than Director Ji. I guess her wish came true in a way. That's an awful thing to say. By the way, what is she doing these days? To my Chan-sil. You looked gaunt when you came to Busan. Seeing you in grief causes much distress to your mother and me. The past is hard to let go, but you must try harder to let go of it. Have courage and rise from your sorrows. P.S. I can say this now, but I never cared for Director Ji's movies. They made me sleepy. ♪ Cast into this harsh world ♪ ♪ What could you hope for? ♪ ♪ If wealth and honor were had ♪ ♪ Would you be wanting more? ♪ Hurry up. Stop pushing. Take her shoes off. Should we go to the couch? The lights are on. I think someone's here. Who's here? What the... Jesus! Producer Lee? You're still here? Was she cooking? Have you had dinner? Who let her drink so much? They basically cut out all of her scenes. That bastard, Director Kim, took out all her parts, and that pissed her off. - That's why she drank so much. - Never mind. You can all go now. She said she had lessons later. I'll stay and wait. Who is it? Oh. - You're here. - Yes. Actually... Is Sophie inside? She passed out. Drunk as a skunk. What should I do? Well, I'm leaving. I guess she forgot again. Sometimes, I envy her being able to forget so easily. It's chilly at night. It was so sunny this afternoon. You noticed that? Yes. So did I. It was so sunny. Would you like to get a drink? I'll buy. No, I will. Let's go. Sitting here like this feels like a scene from one of Ozu Yasujiro's films. - You're right. - Right? He's my most favorite filmmaker. I saw "Tokyo Story." It was a bit boring. Nothing really happens. I'm growing fonder of more entertaining films. What do you mean, "nothing happens"? The mother dies and the son gets killed in the war. How is that "nothing happening"? He illustrates it in a very simple... What's wrong with simple? The most precious things in life are simple. Director Yasujiro captured that in his films. He captures everyday miracles in all his films! Do you not see that? I see it. But I prefer Christopher Nolan movies. Nolan? So you're into those. I loved Hong Kong cinema when I was a kid. Sure. Hong Kong cinema is great, too. I loved Leslie Cheung when I was a kid. Did you just move in? No, I've been here all along. You must be Lee Chan-sil. Nice to meet you. Who are you? - I'm Leslie Cheung. - Leslie Cheung? You look nothing like him. And how did you know my name? Are you a ghost? Only some people can see me... Anyway, I'm Leslie Cheung. I've gone mad. I've lost my marbles. I gave my life to film. No man, no children... Now I'm broke and losing my mind! Goodness gracious! Aren't you cold? No, I'm quite hot-blooded. From all my repressed anger issues. I have anger issues, too. Maybe you're going through menopause. Ghosts don't have menopause. I didn't know that. I have to get to the theater. I'm meeting a woman there at three. Wait... - Is it Maggie Cheung? - No. There's another woman who recognizes me. Go. Hurry. Chan-sil. Let's meet more often. You'll always find me in that room. I'd rather not... - Put some clothes on! - I will, next time. Ma'am? Didn't you see the man running out the door? Who? I didn't see anyone. You didn't? You really need to look after your health. I'm cooking chicken. You should have some. Aren't you eating? No. Why aren't you eating? You're learning to read and write? Yes. At the community center just nearby. Girls weren't schooled in my day. They used to say it made us promiscuous. - You're not a ghost, are you? - Huh? What kind of nonsense is that? If you see a ghost, tell it to take me away. C-H... J... G... Stop consonants are hard to learn. I know. They're so hard. - But try again. - Okay. Black garlic. Raspberry. Charcoal-grilled chicken. Stone-cooked egg. Excellent. I memorized them. Don't do that. You can always ask me for help. That would be nice. Since I lost my only daughter, there's no one to read the bills in the mail. That's why I'm learning now. - Your daughter passed away? - Yeah. Are you married? Were you? I never married. What kept you single all those years? I made movies. Use anything you need from the middle room. - I can go in there? - You can. Maybe these belonged to her daughter... You're here. Goodness gracious! I thought you were a ghost. I am. And a peculiar one. Goodness. The landlady's daughter used to love movies. - My movies especially. - Oh. She even has VHS tapes. Chan-sil. Are you sure you can quit? Quit what? Can you live without making movies? So you know things that we can't see, right? All I know is that I tell you things the way I see them. Right. Will I be able to work in film again? I doubt that's what your problem is now. Then what is it? Your problem is that you don't know what you really want. No, I know. No, you don't! What? What did you say? Nothing. Sometimes you just want a man to sweep you away. Right? Dead right. You're leaving already? I need to think. I have to dig deep within myself. Move over to the bed. No. - Get out of the way. - I don't want to. What's gotten into you? - Sis. - Yeah. Should I stop acting? Where did that come from? Did someone criticize your acting? How did you know? Who was it? It doesn't matter. I worked so hard... I'm so sad. Tell me. Which goddamn director was it? It wasn't a director. - The netizens... - What? - The netizens! - "Netizen"? You should really dig deep within yourself. Think deeply about it on that bed. Go on! I don't speak French well. I cannot act well. I have no brain. That's right. Very good. - Sophie, I'm going home. - Already? We should wrap up as well. Really? Then let's all have dinner. I want some seafood. Seafood? You need to dig deep within yourself. Where are you headed? There's a park I often go to to take walks. I need to do some thinking. Shall I join you? I doubt Nolan fanatics would find it much interesting, though. You sure can hold a grudge. That's just my preference. Don't judge someone on the movies they like. I did? - Shall we? - Okay. "Let's make sure to see the sunrise and sunset." "Let's speak politely to adults and to our friends." "Let's not write or draw things on the walls." "Let's be kind to animals and plants." "Let's give our seats to elderly passengers." "Let's keep our mouths shut and our legs together." It's nice. The phrases are great. Really? - You like this sort of writing? - Yes. I just said so. You did. - Looks like winter is coming. - Yes. Might suddenly freeze to death. - Who might? - Me. What were you going to think about at the park? About what I really want. I'd like to know what it is that you really want. How old are you, Yeong? Are you married? I'm thirty-five, and single. Human age is nothing compared to the age of the universe. What is this place? - There you are. - Yes. - Care to join me? - Yes. - I'll take those. - Okay. It's cozy. I think grannies deliberately forget the pain that they've been through. How else can they laugh with such innocence? - My grandma laughs like that. - Yeah? My grandma raised me. She's still alive, but she doesn't recognize me anymore. My grandma passed away. She was a simple woman who couldn't even read or write. But she knew everything about life. Maybe she just knew nothing goes according to plan. All grannies know what life is. They know the good days and the bad. Have you always been this kind at heart? Huh? Did I just say something? Where did he go? - I have questions. - You're home. Yes. I borrowed something from this room yesterday. And I said you could. Do you need help on homework today? No. Just help me clean these bean sprouts. Sure thing. You're in a good mood today. Does it look that way? Why did you quit your job? The director I worked with for many years suddenly passed away. So you can't work anymore? Yes. I wanted to keep working, but it wasn't up to me. You're still young. You can do anything. There's nothing I want to do anymore. That's one good thing about being old. There's really nothing you want to do? Is that even possible? I just do whatever I feel like each day. But I give it my best. Then... I guess you wanted to clean bean sprouts today. There you go. He said he'd be here. I guess he's gone to Hong Kong. Good morning. Goodness. I did as you said and put some clothes on today. But you didn't come home yesterday. That's not my home. You said you would always be there. Did you do some digging while I was gone? Let's sit down somewhere and talk. Over there. I thought about it. I was digging deep within. But a man appeared. - I knew that. - I thought so. I shouldn't be dating right now. But no matter how hard I try not to, I can't help thinking of him! From now on, I won't stop myself. You already made up your mind. But I still want to know if it'll work out. - You'll be fine. - Right? I had a hunch that we'd be fine. Yes. What a perceptive man. - A perceptive ghost! - Ghosts feel pain, too. Sorry. How can you sleep on so many bad comments? Huh? What comments? You're so perky today. - Did you have energy drinks? - Nope. But I feel like I could even fight off a bull. Did you do some thinking? About what? Your acting. - Oh, that. - Yes, that! - I dug deep, like you said. - And? But I couldn't think, and now that's stuck on my mind. - It might be because of my name. - Your name? What about it? The name "Sophie" means wisdom. It means the answer is already in my head, and I shouldn't torture myself thinking about it! Marvelous. You're destined for a wonderful life. Can you give me Yeong's phone number? What for? Hello, Yeong. It's Chan-sil. I was just wondering what you're up to today. I'm at Seongnam Media Center! Can I come by later? - Bye. - See you next week. Yeong. You found your way around. - Am I interrupting? - Not at all. One second. - Should we get lunch? - Sure. You packed lunch? Where should we go? - Here you go. - Thank you. Have you been teaching long? Yes. A few years. It's a short film workshop for adults. Is it fun? I wouldn't exactly say that, but it helps me pay the bills. Yeong. Do you think you can live without making films? I've never considered that... I guess some things are more important. Spending time with people. Making friends. Loving someone and being loved in return. Things like that are just as important. So I guess I can. I think you're a great person, Yeong. - Winter is really here. - It is. The mosquitoes sure are gone. Feels like something from a movie. You have such passion for film. I do? Not really... I used to think so, but I'm not so sure now. Whenever I see something breathtaking these days, I just wish I had someone to share it with. I know. Sharing it with someone makes it so much better. Yeong. I just wish someone would comfort me. I'm sorry. I think you're kind, like a caring older sister. Older sister? I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea, Producer Lee. No, it's okay. I just lost my senses for a moment. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I've got to run. Producer Lee... Poor thing. This one died, too. - I'm home. - Hi. What happened to you? What do you mean? - Never mind. - Good night. Can you help me with this? The plants all died due to the sudden frost. I want to take this inside. - Here? - That's fine. Put it down here. Shouldn't we bring the others inside, too? No, they're all dead. But I might be able to save this one. Yes... I hope you can. - Good night, then. - Okay. Get some rest. Chan-sil. Chan-sil! - Chan-sil? - What? Let me come in. You said he and I would be fine together. I never said "together." I simply said that you'll be fine. - It's the same thing! - How is that the same? God, you're annoying. Stop knocking! - I came to comfort you. - No, thanks. It's only comforting when it comes from the right person. - Am I not enough for you? - Shut up. But you two will become good friends in the end. Shouldn't you be in Hong Kong? Don't you want to be friends with him? Why must you date him? Stop being so greedy and let him become your friend. This is nothing but loneliness. It's not love. Chan-sil. Knowing what you truly desire is the only way to happiness. You're a remarkable person, so just hang in there. All right? Sweet dreams. I need a week off, Sophie. I'm too depressed to clean. I'm sorry. Leslie. Leslie Cheung? Are you mad at me for quitting filmmaking? What? Are you crying? Who are you talking to? - You're throwing these out? - Yes. - They're coming to collect them. - Okay. It's good to let go. That way you can let new things in. Caller ID Yeong Kim Can you help me with homework? - Huh? - You don't feel like it? - No, I'll be right out. - Okay. Hello? Producer Lee, it's Yeong. Okay. I didn't see you at Sophie's house. I told her I'm taking the week off. If it's because of me, please don't... I really don't mind, and I understand. - Producer Lee... - I'm not a producer anymore. Then what should I call you? - "Sister" seems appropriate. - Oh... - Sis? - I'm listening. Let me buy you dinner. Let's be friends, sis. Potentially. I'm here. I just don't understand this. Should it be long? Or short? What's the assignment? - They want me to write a poem. - A poem? Don't overthink it. Just write about anything. - Can it be one sentence? - You think that's enough? You said to write anyhow! You can write about anything, not just anyhow. - Just try. I'll look it over. - Fine. - You're done? - Yes. What is this? Did I get it wrong? It's misspelled chicken scratch... Is it that wrong? What did you write? "Flowers return with the seasons." "If only we could, too." Are you crying? Why are you crying? I don't know. "Pretty with a close look" "Lovely with a long gaze" "So are you." It's marvelous. How can a poem be so pretty? I didn't get this feeling when I read it in French. It's so lovely, right? This is the original text. It's so pleasant. "Pretty with a close look" "Lovely with a long gaze" "So are you." I'll bring French chansons next time. Chanson? That might really help. Did you hear the poem? What? Never mind. Can Yeong and I come over some time? What for? I heard you have the best DVD collection, sis. They would only bore you. Like pearls before swine. Sis... Did something happen with you two? It's awkward... And why do you call her "sis," but not me? We're back with our weekly dose of cinema from around the globe, focusing on wonderful foreign films you shouldn't miss. Film critic Jung Sung-il is here with us. - Welcome back. - Thank you. Our listeners enjoyed last week's review of "Wings of Desire." Thank you. Which film will you be reviewing today? Last week's "Wings of Desire" surely warmed our hearts, but "Time of the Gypsies," which I'll be reviewing today, is all about the tears... Where did you get that? Chan-sil. You like "Time of the Gypsies," don't you? Like you have to ask? It's the reason why you wanted to work in film. That's right. And it's why I'm still stuck in a rut. - So try this on. - No. Breathtaking. Mr. Cheung. When I was much younger, I was always longing for something. I didn't know how to love, but I thought doing what I love would fill the void. But I was wrong to think that. You can't satisfy this thirst with things like that. A dream you pursue in thirst won't lead to happiness. So now... I want to know what it means to really live. And film is a part of that. I'll root for you, from the depths of outer space. Thank you. I will always remember you. - Ma'am. - Yes? This is supposed to help your back? Yes. It's good for your back and helps build muscles. Better not make me live longer. Don't say things like that. There's nothing good about getting older. You said it was nice being old. Did I? - Let's have lunch together. - Sounds good. Thank you. I'll do the dishes. You're not busy today? I work two days a week now. You shouldn't dilly-dally that much. I don't dilly-dally. I'm busy. I have lots to do. Sis. Sis! Are you sleeping? What's this? You're writing a screenplay? It's too boring. I can't read any more. Good golly! You're up. When did you fall asleep? I don't know. I must've been tired. Let me turn on the lights. Okay. What's going on? It's not working? - The bulb must be out. - Really? - The guys will be here soon... - Huh? What? Nothing. Hang on. Ma'am! Ma'am? - Do you have any bulbs? - Lightbulbs? - Did it burn out? - Yes. - I don't. - I'll go buy some then. - Good night. - Okay. Sis. You should stay inside. Gosh... How can the moon be so huge? You think it's pretty? Yeah. - Producer Lee! - It's us! What is this? Hi, sis. She seems mad because I didn't tell her we were coming. Wait inside while I head to the store. No, I can go. I'll go with you, Sophie. - Then I'll go, too. - So will I. Never mind, sis. I'll go to the store. Let's all go. - Sis. - Yeah? I swear by the moon, this is the most beautiful winter night. Don't swear. The moon changes like everything else. - It's freezing. - I know. - Producer Lee. - Yeah? Let's make movies together again. Yeah, sis. That would be great. Go ahead of me. I'll light the way. For all we wish to believe. For all we wish to do. For all we wish to see.
