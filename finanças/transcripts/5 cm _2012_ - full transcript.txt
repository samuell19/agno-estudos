INSPIRED BY REAL LIFE EVENTS TOGETHER FOREVER THE FIVE OF US Have you ever had best friends for almost ten years and never missed a single weekend to hang out together? These are my friends. The first one, he has the fittest body. Geez, they have soy sauce here too, you know. Just in case. His name is-- Arial is very manly. He's cool, kind, but unfortunately for Arial, every time he meets a woman-- You're Arial, right? I'm Indy. Remember? The one who wanted to be introduced to you yesterday. And the week before. Which is a shame, because he's never had a girlfriend despite really wanting one. My second magical creature is-- Between the five of us, Ian is the only one cursed with suffering an unfinished thesis. Wait a minute. Whatever we do, we always do it together. Ian. We have a theory that there are three curses preventing Ian from graduating. The first curse is-- Come on. Come on. Die. Eat my goals! You jerk. He's just a kid. Ian! No more noodles! I'm warning you, you can't eat noodles every day! -His second curse-- -I'm not! I'm making tea! Besides, we're out of noodles. Let see, whose turn is it tonight? And Ian's third curse is-- Excuse me, do you have any Discovery series? The Explorer edition? With prehistoric beasts? And do you have the biography of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, George Lucas, Spielberg, and that guy who invented Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo? My third friend is the most beautiful of the five of us. Riani is like an angel that fell from the heavens, and turned into an amazing friend. Okay, Sir, our orders are four corned beef egg noodles, two with cheese, and two plain. One with the egg soft boiled, the other three hard-boiled. The soft-boiled egg is for the plain noodles. And four grilled sandwiches. One strawberry, one cheese corned beef, one choco-peanut, and a pineapple flavor. Make the pineapple one slightly burnt. And put more nuts than chocolate for the choco-peanut. That's four noodles, right, all of them chicken curry flavor, okay? And can I have an empty bowl for the noodles please? For the drinks, five sweetened iced tea. And don't forget the soy sauce, okay? We are so lucky to have a kind female friend, with all her attentive traits. But even a beautiful creature like Riani -has her quirks. -Ian, can I have some broth, please. If anyone is eating noodles, she has to ask for the broth. And where there's Riani, there's also another friend that's equally cool. Ta, have you decided? Have you rented an office, yet? -Ta? -Ta? This friend of mine is called-- Genta is a man with dreams. Genta once told me that one day, with his dreams, he'll be up there in the sky. Thank you so much, sir. Genta believes with hard work, there will come a day when all his dreams will come true. -Listen up, everyone. -And one of his reasons being-- Release the light to the night sky. And make this night incredible. Project officer to everyone, great job! Thank you very much for all your teamwork. Ta, congratulations. Thanks. Although a lot of girls are attracted to Genta, he only ever looks at one girl and fixes his eyes there for a very long time. To this day, I don't know why they've never dated each other. And the last one, that's me, Zafran. The coolest human being in this group. A man of love. A man who believes in the power of his dreams, and pursues them. A Zafran is a humanist, an idealist and a fantastic human being. For me, poetry, music, and life are a thing of beauty. Love. Love exists only for love. ADAPTED FROM "5CM" THE NOVEL, BY DONNY DHIRGANTORO It's too loud! Your band is a joke, not even famous, but you already have a "Best Of" album? These songs aren't even good. We've put you through college, and you're a graduate now. Do something with your life. Get a job! Be a good son and listen to your parents! Mom, wait. Listen to this. Kahlil Gibran. "Your children are not your children. They are the sons of dawn." Is that so? Well, from now on, cook your own meals, and wash and iron your own clothes! I'm never going to cook for you again! Go eat at a greasy diner or something! Mom. -That's not what I meant, Mom. -No! Mom! And finally, I've decided to make a chronicle about the five of us. So that in the future, these good times we've been through together will never fade away. Gas, please. Full tank. Hey, where are we going next? Let's watch a movie. Watch what? Nothing good is playing. It looks like someone's been planning for a movie date. Look at you, you exercise every day, every week, but wind up with typhoid. Play video game like me, and stay healthy and sound. I got sick because of you, idiot. You're the one who wanted to go around ogling teens, Fatso. So you went to train in two gyms just to pick up chicks? And he didn't even get any. It was your idea, King Kong. So what do you guys want to do? Hang out at my house? Not again. Yeah, all we get is cassava cheese and ABC syrup. You just ate a bowl of porridge! Arian's right. Let's go to his house. I have to keep in touch with "Mom and Dad." By the way, Indah is home isn't she, "brother"? When did my mom gave birth to you? And when did I became your brother? Someone's got the sudden urge to "keep in touch." You poor, hopeless romantic. -Future brother-in-law. -No, thanks. But what if your sister likes me? For Dinda, I can be a great brother-in-law. We could be happy. Nope. Come on, brother. Get off me. Hurry up, will you? You didn't tell the others to hurry up. Yal, is your sister home? -Don't know. -What a shame. I've brought poetry of million flowers for her. Why can't you come here alone? We're not your wing men, you know? Watch out for his brother, he's big and scary. One hit, and you're out. -Patience, Ple. -Mom? -Hey, Honey. -Mom. -How are you, Auntie? -Evening, Auntie. Evening, Uncle. -You look lovely as ever, Auntie. -You too. Evening. I'll be going now, okay. -Okay. Drive safely, dear. -Alright. -Okay, Dad. -Arial, I'll be going now. -Yes, take care, Dad. -You guys take it easy, alright. Okay, Uncle. Take care, Uncle. You guys are staying, right? Good thing I've just bought a bunch of cassava cheese. Thanks, Auntie. I'm so glad to meet you guys again. Excuse me a moment. Arinda! -Yes, Mom! -Yal's friends are here. Can you come down a moment, dear? Hi, everyone. Hi, Genta. Riani. Hello, Ian. Hello, Zafran. Ian, she called me by my name. So poetic. She calls everyone by their name, idiot. Where did you guys go? We ate porridge in Cikini. Why didn't you take me? Dinda, that's-- That is-- What are you up to, Din? Doing my paper on economics. -Anyone know the IS-LM curve? -Ta? Investment-Saving, Liquidity-Money, right? -Right. -Macro or micro economy? Macro. You know this? Can you help me? It's kind of complicated. I'm not familiar with macro, I only know micro. I'll help you do the paper. Help me how? This paper is on economics. I can design the cover for you to make your paper look nice. And I can insert the graphics for illustration. -The best kind of graphics. -The lecturer said no graphics. Okay then, I'm going to start writing again. I'm going upstairs. Bye, everyone. Bye. She's inviting me to her room. She's going to work on her papers, you sick chicken. Perfection. G-string, man! G-string! Look at that behind. Look at those curves. It's to die for. There. Look at her panties. They're so visible! Imagine being able to touch her. Touch her where she wants to be touched. Not to mention those breasts. And she's wearing a black bra. Imagine taking it off with your teeth. My Zafran! A woman is the most beautiful of creations that lives in every breath that you take. You will see the reflection of her shine in every drop of morning dew. That will mark the beginning of your fortunes that day. My Zafran. Only if you love her like the morning dew, will she love you completely and eternally. Lies. Don't listen to him. G-string, man! What do you guys want to drink? Just water, Auntie. Just water? Zafran? G-string, Auntie. That was out of line, man. It was a slip of the tongue, Yal. Okay then, no more discussions about that in the Secret Garden, alright? Alright. Come on. Fatso. Bring out the food. This is one mean looking satay. She's probably asleep by now, Ple. Her lights are out. That doesn't mean she's asleep already. Who knows, she might just be lying around. Besides, on a beautiful night like this, I'm sure she can hear my voice. She's not sleeping in her room tonight, she's sleeping in my mom's. -Why didn't you say so earlier? -My Dad's going to Surabaya. And Mom's a bit paranoid with those weird paranormal shows on TV. Then I just sang for nothing. Your song was beautiful. I swear. It's cool. It's boring. Don't you have any other songs? I have a dream. That one day, when we all have children, we will still hang out here. Together. Hey, Fatty. Your noodle's here. If Ian has noodles, Riani will say-- Ian, can I have some broth, please. I think there's something we need to talk about. What is it? Aren't you guys bored of... of us? It feels like nothing's changed these past ten years. I don't know why I just remembered what Ian said that night at school. I don't even know why I still remember it. When Ian said, he doesn't have any friends beside the five of us, maybe it's just my feeling, but I feel the same way. Same here. I felt like that too. Am I right? It feels like we don't have any other friends outside the five of us. Well, it's the usual. Same old day. Maybe we should stop seeing each other for a while. What are you talking about? No. I refuse. What's the matter with you guys? There's nothing wrong with us. Why do you want to stop seeing each other? Weird. I think so too. I want to finish my thesis. You guys have it easy since you've already graduated. I haven't. See? Immediately there's something new that we can do. I just don't want us to get bored. Let's just step out of our comfort zone for a bit. Pursue those dreams of ours we haven't fulfilled. Search for new ones. Yeah, I agree. Wholeheartedly. How about it? Riani? Don't cry. That's not the Riani I know. My Riani's not a cry-baby. I don't want to lose you guys. Of course you won't, Ni. Never. What about you, Arial? You're in, right? -For how long? -How about six months? No. That's too long. No. Okay then. How about three? So for the next three months, we can't meet, call or text. What do you think? Zero communication by any means until August 14th. Three months, huh? That's quite a long time. I have no idea how you guys will get on without me. But, Ta, how will we meet on August 14th? We should celebrate. What do you think this is, Independence Day? I already have a plan. I'll create a reminder for August 14th on my phone. On August 7th, I'll text you the details of where to meet. We can't know the plan now? No. So it'll be a surprise. Just trust me. I guarantee it won't be cringy. This'll be a cool plan. -I'll kick your ass if it's cringy. -It won't be. It'll be awesome. If this works, you'll never forget it for the rest of your lives. For the rest of our lives! That means, tonight's our last night together then. ONE MONTH LATER UNIVERSITY OF INDONESIA DEPOK How long were you in elementary school? Six years, sir. Why? If it also takes you six years to finish college, then you have the brains of an elementary school student! Work on the second chapter. You have four days. Finish it! What? Just four? How long were you in elementary, Ian? Yes, sir. Hello, this is Mr. Arianto, Mrs. Ariani, Arial and Arinda's residence. How may I help you? Shit. Hello? Hello. Dinda? It's Zafran. Ah, Zafran. What's up? "WHAT'S UP" BY DINDA Nothing. Where are you, Dinda? At home. I'll call your home number then, alright? What's up? "WHAT'S UP" BY DINDA Nothing. Just wanted to chat with you. Go ahead. But you've got to pick up, okay? I'm not talking to Arial at the moment, remember? Okay. Good afternoon. This is Mr. Arianto, Mrs. Ariani, Arial and Arinda's residence. How may I help you? You already know it's me. What's with the formal greeting? That's always been the rules. Dinda, what are you up to? I'm on the phone. Why are you quiet? Nothing. What's Arial up to right now? He's lifting weights. I see. Lifting weights, huh? Why? You want to talk to him? No, don't! We're all on a break, remember? What is it with you guys? You guys had a fight? Why don't you guys ever come around anymore? Here's the deal. We were all hanging out-- I see. Right. Is that so? Well, that was the deal. "Yeah"? What the hell does that mean? I didn't ask for an answer. Dinda, how's college? The usual. Classes. -How's campus? -Crowded. Where do you hang out on campus? -I don't. -Of course. You don't have time to hang out. Too many assignments from professors, huh? On campus, I don't hang out. I usually just sit. God, have mercy! Zafran, why are you begging for mercy? Is someone beating you? Later, okay, Dinda? I'm going to go and write a poem. Got work to do, huh? No. I just feel like writing a poem. Yeah, I know. You've got a job order to write one. Yal told me you're an artist who often win job tenders. Good Lord, Dinda! Nobody writes a poem by tender. By order. Poetry is the beauty of life. The splendor of words. It's got so many meanings. What kind of poem do you plan to write? A poem for you, Dinda. But I didn't ask you to write one for me. I'll just talk to you later, okay, Dinda? -Alright. -Bye, Dinda. Thanks for calling. Okay. COOLERTHANANDYWARHOLL Ta-da! HELLO, ANDY. Hello. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? Nothing, in a bad mood, tired SAME HERE. WHERE ARE YOU? At home. You? AT WORK, WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO STOP. WHAT'S THE HURRY... DOWN, BOY. Don't want to chat with a guy. Sorry. ASL? 24ISH/F/WORKING/JKT Nice. Why is your nickname "Miss You?" MISSING SOMEONE! Aww. Who's the guy? Same here, me too. Don't know what to do. She doesn't show any emotion. I don't think we're a match. But I can't get rid of her from my eyes and heart. NOT BEING A MATCH IS JUST RELATIVE. GO CHASE HER. MAKE AN EFFORT. WHY THE SUDDEN POETRY? I did, but there's no progress. BETTER THAN ME. HUGE CRUSH SINCE FOREVER, BUT HE HAS NO CLUE. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT GUYS. THEY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. IT'S TOUGH BEING A GIRL. CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. That's tough. Does he have a girlfriend yet? NOPE. Are you sure? YEAH, HE'S VERY CLOSE TO ME. Call him. Ask him out to dinner or something. A GIRL CAN'T DO THAT. BESIDES, WE SPEND EVERY MOMENT TOGETHER. SO WE'RE JUST REALLY TIGHT BUDDIES. You meet every single day? NOT REALLY. WE USED TO, BUT AREN'T AT THE MOMENT. Why? He has a job? YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, BY PROJECTS. HE WORKS BY HIMSELF. WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER WELL, BUT I'VE TOLD YOU A LOT. MAY I KNOW YOUR REAL NAME? Fine, but you first. GUYS FIRST, OKAY? How sexist of you. This is my real name. l swear I rarely lie, so you have to tell me your real name too, okay? DEAL. COOLERTHANANDYWARHOLL OFF Damn it! Jerk. I just wanted to talk to someone. Zafran, are you using the computer? I'm baking a cake in the microwave. Our meter can't handle it! Turn the air-con off! Mom, just turn the fridge off! Ni, let's go home. What are you doing? Chatting? God, you're seriously that lonely? Citra, I need to talk to you. I swear, I've just realized it now. I've kept it bottled inside for years. I admit it. I want more from him. Not just friendship. Tough, isn't it? You guys are too close. That's just it. I can't discern his feelings. -Do you have the guts to say it first? -I don't think I can, Cit. You've hidden it for years. I have no idea how you did it. No wonder you can't be comfortable around him anymore. You've already set a place for him in your heart. The thing is, he doesn't know you've set one for him. It'd be a shame if the nice corner was left empty. You're right. Do I love him or do I love my comfort zone? You don't want him not to know, right? And what if someone slips in and he's okay with it. Chapters two, three, four and five. I've only got two months. Bring it on! Looks good. Continue onto chapter three, okay? No revisions, sir? Just a bit, but leave it for later. Work on the research questionnaires for now. You have to acquire the data first. That's the toughest part. -Ian. Here, I made you some tea. -Thanks, Mom. Nice. "National Geographic." No, Dad! It's broken. The DVD's broken. Ian. Your mom and I are so happy you're about to graduate. Hopefully it will be soon, yeah? When you graduate, your mom and I plan to take you overseas. You still want to go to Manchester, don't you? Yes! Yes, Dad! We'll go on a vacation there, just for a week. We'll go and visit my old campus. The old dorm where I used to live. Your mom and I might head back early... while you stay in Manchester to prepare everything. Just like you've always wanted. I've arranged everything. You can take your postgraduate there. If your grades are good enough, you can finish in three years. Are you serious, Dad? Really? I'm going to go to Manchester! We'll run the Jakarta event as a pilot project. Of course, to allow your company to evaluate how our team operates. And then, if the project in Jakarta is a success and you all agree to it... we'll run the event across Indonesia. Hi, Zafran. What's up? "WHAT'S UP" BY DINDA -What're you up to now? -Just got back from campus. Just got back from campus, huh? Hello, Mr. Dono? Yes. How are the questionnaires doing? Ian, we've got some problems. The Board didn't approve. We can't release the forms. We also need to pull the data you have. I'm so sorry, Ian. It's alright. What's wrong? This is what I was afraid of. But that's the challenge you have to face. What's with the dark circles? Not getting enough sleep? Yes, sir. I was reading and studying everything, to finish the next chapter faster. So I can have my thesis exam in two months. Go to this place. It's not far from here. Hello, Mr. Rudy. You have a guest waiting for you at the front. Alright, thank you, sir. Just a moment, sir. -Ian, right? -Yes, sir. Just leave the questionnaires here. There are 300 in total, sir. Can I collect them in a week? Thank you, sir. If someone asks for me, I've gone for lunch, okay? Yes, sir. Afternoon. You're Indy, right? Yeah. Why? So you can talk after all. I can. I'm Arial. I want to be your friend. Indy. Why are you so sweaty? That's how I get when I'm nervous. So you're nervous right now? Yes. Where to now, Ma'am? I don't know. I just don't want to go home right now. Me too. Want to go to Puncak? It's not far from here. What for? My family owns a villa there. We can have a nice chat there. And on the way we can get some roasted corn, durian or bandrek. What do you say? But no funny business, okay? What do you mean? Nothing. Let's go then. This corn is so yummy. You're just like a kid. You're worse, you're so obedient. I don't care. Jerk. Mr. Ian? Here are your questionnaires. Thank you, Miss. Miss, why aren't these questionnaires filled out? -Tanti! -Excuse me for a minute, sir. If the fat-ass college kid who called drops by, just tell him we can't help him out. I'm sick of dealing with this kind of shit. There's no money in it. Excuse me. Do you have a jack? Mine's broken. Here you go, sir. You can borrow mine. Thank you. Where do you work? That's my office right there. I see. -Which department? -Human Resources. What a coincidence! I working on a thesis on Human Resources, but nobody wants to accept the questionnaires. Can you help? Sure. Can I take a look? Here you go. The questionnaire's got good questions. My department happens to be addressing the same issue. We're also conducting a survey. So how about it, sir? Sure. I'll take them. When can I hand it back to you? If possible, sooner than later. I have a tight deadline. How about in a week? A week? This'll only take two days at most! Ian! What is your problem with the Academic Department? Don't mess around with me! What's the use of me backing you up so you can defend your thesis? Read this! "With this letter, the Thesis Committee hereby requests the presence of Mr. Adrian Adriano, a student under the council of Mr. Sukonto Legowo, to defend his thesis on a thesis examination to be held on--" I'm going to have the exam, sir? I'm going to have my thesis exam! Yes! I'm finally going to graduate! Thank you very much, Mr. Genta. Because of your teamwork, our event was a huge success. My pleasure, sir. Don't hesitate to contact us again. -Of course. Thank you. -Until next time. Evening, guys! I freaking miss you all. I swear! On the 14th, let's meet up at Senen Train Station at 14:00. If you've got plans between the 14th and 20th, cancel everything, alright? This is what you need to bring. If you don't own anything, just borrow some. You've still got a week. A backpack, lots of sweaters, a flashlight and batteries, food and snacks for four days, sunglasses, some antiseptics, meds, shoes and flip-flops. If you can, start small exercises starting today. Especially you, Ian. That's it. See you guys at Senen Train Station at 14:00, okay? Genta, who misses you all. EXIT My love, I am leaving now. Till we meet again, love. PLATFORM THREE Juple! Wait. How are you, Ta? You asshole, playing around. I've missed you a lot, Juple. -I've missed you, man. -Genta, Zafran! -Riani! -Hey, Riani! -I've missed you both! You meanies. -It's his fault. -Crazy Rambo! -What's up, guys? Riani! -Genta, you're one crazy-ass dude! -What's up, man? -Juple! -What's new with you? By the way, I brought someone along. She really wanted to tag along. -Who? -Where is she? Said she needed to go to the bathroom. There she is! My love. Love indeed appears when love is in need of love. Thank you, universe. Awesome! I won't be the only girl. Hi, everyone. Hello, Zafran. What's wrong, Zafran? She said, "What's wrong?" Your attention, please. The train leaving from Jakarta to Malang will be departing in 15 minutes. Our train is leaving. -Let's go. -Come on. Ta, where's Ian? Alright. You guys get onboard, I'll look for Ian. Rambo and Juple, you guys wait by the door. Got it. Come on, guys. -Ta, the train is moving. -Where is that damn kid? There he is. Ian! -Hurry up, Chubby! -Ian, come on! Ian, hurry up. -Ian, go, Ian! -You can make it, Ian! -Run for it, Chubby! -Ian, the train's leaving! -Go, Ian! -Come on, Ian! Go, Ian! Go, chubby! -Genta! -Chubby! Come on, Chubby. Ouch! You made it after all, dude. Our seats are over there. Genta, what time will we get to Malang? Probably tomorrow around noon. Around 13:00 or 14:00 at the latest. So, we'll be on the train for almost the whole day? Ta, where exactly are we going? Yeah, Ta. Where are we headed, bro? Not telling. Curious, aren't you? Serves you right. Genta, want some? Sure. I don't usually eat this. What? I dropped it. Ple, can you get it for me? What's this? No, don't read it. A receipt for his porn DVDs. Here you go. That's a disgusting habit, man. Piggy, you're still buying porn DVDs? When the hell are you going to graduate? I didn't know they give out receipts for porn. They never gave me one. SUMMONS FOR A THESIS EXAMINATION It's not, see? Ian's going to graduate! Congratulations, Chubby. You're finally graduating. -Ian, you're graduating? -Yeah. You'll be a college graduate soon. Congratulations! Excuse me. Is it someone's birthday? No, sir. Someone just got a job as a whale at the marine park. Thank you, guys. If I'd known you'd react like this, I'd have told you by text. So, are you going ahead with the postgraduate plan in England? That means you're leaving us. Which college, Ian? There's a great business school in Manchester. The one my dad used to attend. That's one less ducky water-bike ride at the park. Off to Manchester. The noodle industry profit will plummet. I know you, dude. You want to go to Manchester so you can watch MU at Old Trafford, right? You got that right! Got to kill two whales with one stone while having ice cream with syrup and jelly with Wayne Rooney. Here's your Wayne Rooney. This sucks, Ian's leaving. I am going to miss my personal banana boat. Three. Sucks to be you! This country is amazingly beautiful, God. Help us protect its splendor. Amen. I swear to God, the view's incredible. -Dinda, will you come with me? -Where to? Just come with me. Watch me, okay? Now it's your turn. Just try. It's really fun. Hold on to this. MALANG TRAIN STATION PLATFORM ONE Guys, welcome to Malang. -What's our next stop, Ta? -Tumpang. What kind of place is Tumpang? The gateway to our destination. Let's go. Let me go take care of the transportation first. This will be their first time. So tired. -Come on. Load your bags. -A Jeep? This is awesome, Ple! Let the adventure begin. WELCOME TO BROMO TENGGER SEMERU NATIONAL PARK This picture is cute, too. What about it? Guys, Indonesia sends you her regards. And that... is Mahameru. For those who've been curious about our destination, there's your answer. Our dream now is that later we will all be standing there. A place we will never forget for the rest of our lives. This is incredible. Mahameru is seriously awesome. -3,676 meters above sea level. -The highest peak in Java. -Ta? -Yes? -We're seriously going there? -Stand there? -Yes. -You think we can, Ta? Is the terrain going to be tough, Ta? Yeah, Ta. And we're bringing a whale, too. Yeah. You think I'm strong enough? No idea. I don't think so. That's why I told you to jog for a week. -Did you run? -I did. Every single day? Impressive. No. Just one day. -You're such a whale. -You can do it, Ian. I'm sure of it. You'll make it. We all agree we'll reach the peak? I've placed that peak and us, right here. Here, right, Ple? All that we require now are feet that will march further than they ever have. Hands that will accomplish greater things than they ever have. Eyes that will look further than they ever have. Necks that will look up more often. Layers of will, thousands of times stronger than steel. Hearts that will labor harder than they ever have. And lips that will utter unceasing prayers. We've made it to Ranupani. The last village. From here on out, we go on foot. Please fill in your members' names and your own. -Alright. -Also your equipment and supplies list. Will do. -Ian, can I have some broth, please? -Here you go. Watch out. You'll spill it. Ha! He stole some. As long as nobody takes a bite out of mine. Nobody wants your disgusting sweet soy sauce sandwich, Rambo. Go for variety. We're in the mountains and you still go for soy sauce? Don't laugh too loud in the mountains. Yal, let's go and sleep. It's too cold. Alright. Good night, Chubby. Chubby, let's get some sleep. You go ahead, man. -You sure? -Yeah. Alright. Good night, Dinda. FINAL THESIS: THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE COMPETENCE ON WORK EFFICIENCY Ian, Ranupani is incredible, isn't it? Yeah. But you can't open a banana boat business here though, alright? Why not? -You'll pollute Ranupani. -Jerk. Before we go, let us pray. Let's begin our prayers. Amen. -Keep your spirits up! -Alright. Big brother. Help me out. Come on. Watch for the trees. How long have we been walking, Ni? Quite a while. Let's take a break. Break! Is it still far, Ta? We're not even halfway there. Around noon or one, -we'll reach-- -The peak? Ranu Kumbolo. The peak is still a long way off. Roughly 18 hours away. Another 18 hours? We've walked this far and haven't made a dent? That's why we're taking it slow. Just chat to avoid getting tired. If you are, tell me. Don't hang on to your pride. If one of us is tired, everybody stops. Most people don't make it because they're tired, but too proud to say so. Because of that, they can't continue the hike. Let's go. Come on. We have to continue. You won't feel it later. The view is spectacular. Rambo. You take the lead. We'll switch positions. Follow the track. Just make sure not to enter the forest. You just need to follow the sun. It's a clear path. -I'll be at the back. -Yes, sir. -Who is it, sis? -What? Don't lie. You can't hide it. -Busted, huh? -Of course. I keep thinking about him. Are you okay with it? If you're both into each other, what else can I do? -Arinda's in love. -Shut up. The view's amazing, isn't it, Ta? I'm really glad you brought us here. I can one day tell my husband, children and grandchildren. "I once climbed Mount Mahameru, you know." Right, Ta? -Riani? -Yes, Ta? Zafran! What's wrong with your foot? Zafran. What's wrong? Damn, it's weird. I didn't feel a thing. -Don't touch it. -Here, use this. -Does it hurt? -Yeah. Here, Riani. How are you, Ple? Does it still hurt? Can you still make it, Ple? Come on. You can continue, right, Ple? Yeah, I can. Let's go. Ple, can I have some water? Mine's all spent. I swear, I'm so freaking thirsty, Ple. Just take it, Ian. That's all I've got left. I drank the rest earlier. Are you for real? Never mind then. We won't have any left later. Are you serious? The others are all out of water, too? This is bad. The peak is still a long way off and we have no water left. Oh, no. There's no more water. Ple? Why did you stop? Ple! Genta! Arial! What is it? Come here! Are you alright, Ple? Ian, I think we've solved our water crisis. Ple, where the hell are we? Ta, where are we now? Guys, welcome to Ranu Kumbolo. The paradise of Mount Semeru. Water! There's water! -Can we dive in? -Yeah, you can. This is why I told you there was no need to bring too much water! Ta, if it were me, and I was in love with someone at such an amazing place, I'd tell her. If people ask, "Where'd you make it official?" I'd say, "The hiking trail of Mahameru." -Cool, huh? -What do you mean "tell"? Don't bullshit me. She's right there. I don't want to talk about it with you. All you do is watch porn. Just tell her. Looks like she feels the same way. It's tough, Ian. We're too close. I can't discern her feelings. I don't want to lose a friend either. You said you didn't want to talk to the porn-guy. Look who's spilling his guts now. Ta, all love should be expressed. No love goes unsaid unless-- Unless it is someone who is too much in love with himself. You're absolutely right. Whose words are those? I think I've heard them somewhere. That's Juple's poem! Anyway, where is Dinda? There she is. See? Looks like Dinda is starting to fall for the serenading verses of "Al Ajnihah Al Mutakassirah." -What's that? -"Broken Wings" by Kahlil Gibran. In that case, Juple is Khalil Zafran. And his poem is "Chicken Wings"! You guys talking about me? Ian, it's no fun being a girl, is it? Why is that? If a girl likes a guy, she can't say it first. She can only wait. You're so old fashioned. In this day and age, plenty of girls express their feelings first. The thing is, he's my friend. We're too close. Isn't that better though? You already understand each other's feelings. You click. You've got a point, Ian. Ifs now five minutes to three. We'll arrive at Arcopodo around 20:00 or 21:00. Ta, are we going up that hill? Damn. That's quite a climb. The Slope of Love. Huh? Why the "Slope of Love," Ta? The two sides of the hill form the shape of a heart. If we climb that slope thinking about the person we love, all your dreams of love will be fulfilled with that person. But there's a catch. While climbing, you must never look down. For real, Ta? Beats me. It's a myth of Mahameru. It's a myth after all. Could be true, could also not be. That means if I keep thinking about the actress Happy Salma, one day she will be my girl. Din, wish me luck. Come on, Chubby. Happy. Didn't he hurt his foot? It's your fault, Ta. You shouldn't have told them. Love is hard work, huh, Ple? Happy. Anything for Dinda, Ian. Me too, Ple. It's hard. But anything for Happy Salma. Juple! Chubby! See you guys at the hill top. Careful, Ta! Let's go, Chubby. -Ian? -Ple. We're not supposed to look down. -It's your fault. -It's yours! -Dumbass. -You're the dumb-ass who skipped school. -Why did you look down? -I was following you! -I got this far. -Damn it! I should've gone up on my own. Why are they sitting down? Are they tired or something? Why are you all laughing? And why are they bickering? You called them and made them look down. To get their wish, they can't look down, remember? My bad, guys! What is this place, Ta? It's so eerie. We're at Kalimati. Kalimati? Why is it so cold all of a sudden? -Ta? -It's volcanic ash. In Kalimati, we can begin to experience Mahameru's volcanic ash. Mahameru is still active. We're getting close. Wear your masks. Let's go. -Excuse me. -Yes? Do you have some extra water? Yeah, we do. Pass it to him. We still have some. -Here you go. -Thank you. Can we ask you something? Back in Kalimati, we had some volcanic ash rain on us. Is it dangerous if we keep climbing? No. That's normal. Semeru is an active volcano. If you want to go up, it's safe. Be sure to head down by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow though, okay? It's getting dark. We should go. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Be careful. Let's go. Ta? Arcopodo. Let's go. It's ten minutes to nine. At 21:00, we'll head to bed. No exceptions. We've only got a short ways to go, but it's the toughest leg. What time do we start heading for the peak, Ta? Later tonight, at 02:00 a.m. Tonight will be the real ascent. Our real ascent? When we head for the peak, leave everything at the campsite. Why? That's the way it is. Everything gets left behind. There's no way for anyone to climb up with a backpack. It's too dangerous. We have to keep our balance. Is it really that dangerous? It's nine. Let's go to bed. After we say our prayers, only discipline will keep us safe up here. Zafran, let's pray. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked Your anger or of those who are astray Amen. -Evening. -Go ahead. Keep up the spirit. That night at Arcopodo, we came to realize it might be that we could write as eloquently as we could, or speak as high as the sky on the meaning of friendship. But on that night Mahameru revealed to us the true meaning of friendship. And in the name of friendship in this beloved country of ours, on August 17th, when a dream became worth fighting for. Here rests our best friend, who shall forever live in our memories. Guys, do you remember what we pledged in that Jeep? What we need to reach the top? Feet that will march further than they ever have. Hands that will accomplish greater things than they ever have. Eyes that will look further than they ever have. Necks that will look up more often. Layers of will, thousands of times stronger than steel. Hearts that will labor harder than they ever have. And lips that will utter unceasing prayers. Watch it on the right. Be careful. It's getting harder to breath. Dust is getting in my mouth as well. And nose. Good God, this is really hard. We start the climb. Watch for rocks from above. Don't step too hard. The rocks will come loose. Listens carefully for people shouting "Rocks!" Look for falling rocks and get ready to avoid them. It's nearly zero degrees Celsius here, so we have to keep moving. Don't rest too much. You can't afford to get too cold. It's dangerous. Where's Arial? What's wrong, Rambo? Ta, I'm cold. Damn. He's freezing. It's like needles piercing my whole body. I can't take it anymore. -Everyone, hold him close! -Closer, so he'll be warmer! I can't take it anymore. No, Arial. You're strong enough. Arial, you managed to say hi to a girl and made her your girlfriend. And now you can't make it past Mahameru? Arial, just a little bit more. We'll stand together on the peak of Mahameru. -You can do it, Rambo. -Come on, Yal. Be strong. You can do it. Big brother, you can do it. I still need you. You'll make it, okay? Let's move. Are you okay, Yal? Tired? Ta, is this what you've been telling us about? The ocean above the clouds? We're above the clouds. We're above the clouds! It's stunning, Ple. My beloved friends, the dawn of our Independence Day, August 17th. Let's move it. We're getting close to the peak of Mahameru. Keep up the spirit! -Look out! Rocks! -Watch out for the rocks! Watch out, rocks! Watch out! Everybody, get down! Big brother! Big Brother! Dinda! Dinda, are you okay? Your legs. Dinda! She's bleeding, Yal. Sis, your ear. Brother. -What is it, Sis? -Ian! Ian! Ian! -Ian! -Turn him over, Ta. Turn him over. Help turn him over. Ian, wake up. Come on, wake up. Ian, wake up! -Open his jacket. -Ian, wake up. -Wake up, Ian. Come on, Chubby. -Chubby! No. Ian, no. Ta. Ta. Ian? Ian, wake up. Come on, Ian! Please don't go. Don't leave us, Ian. -You can't leave us! -Don't leave us, Ian. You're supposed to be graduating, Chubby. Ian, don't leave me. Please. Don't leave me yet, Ian. I've done you wrong so many times. Ian, you can't go. Ian! What's with the screaming, Ple? Sand tastes awful, Ple. I'm never eating it again. Ian. Why are you all crying? Why am I bleeding? Whose blood is this? I'm fine, right? Ian, how many fingers am I holding up? -Two. -How about now? Six. Thank God, Dumbo the Elephant is alright. How many fingers? Shit. He needs to think it over. -Seven. -What? Five. I was just kidding. You have the nerve to joke, fat elephant? Ask him something else. -What is your name? -Adrian Adriano. -Where do you live? -Bumi Road, Mayestik, South Jakarta. Ask him tougher questions. How many times did MU win the Championship League? Three times. What years? In 1968, 1999 and 2008. What is your thesis supervisor's name? Sukonto Legowo. But don't say it in one go. It's a dirty word. How are you doing, Ian? You good? Yeah. -Riani? -I'm good. -Dinda? -I'm fine. -Ple? -I'm okay. -Arial? -Safe and sound. Guys, we're just a few steps away and... it'll be the highest peak in Java. You guys remember when we decided to take a break? I told you everything would turn out amazing. We will never forget this for the rest of our lives. Okay, Juple. Take us to Mahameru. It is an honor for me to stand here fighting for our dreams, in the company of every one of you, my beloved friends. Mahameru, here we come! We're now standing on Mahameru! It is an honor for me. I am Genta. I have climbed the Mahameru with my beloved friends. Here in this beloved country. I will never forget this honor for the rest of my life. It is also an honor for me. And an honor for all of us friends. I am Arial. Someone who truly loves this land. And also for me, Arinda. My beloved Indonesia, I love you with all of my being. Everything begins its journey right here. Dreams, friendship, love, and the miracle of determination. Shaping us to become more than just flesh carrying a name. I am Zafran. I love every one of you. And I love this beautiful country with its myriad of islands, until one day when I die and again become one with this beloved land. And as long as our feet march a thousand steps. As long as our brave hearts are determined to realize everything to this point. May we never, not even once, give up on chasing our dreams. In fighting for, struggling for and dreaming of a better life for the land on which our feet are standing upon, my friends. I am Riani. I love this country with all the fullness of my heart. I am Ian. Proud to be standing here with my beloved friends. I will love this motherland for the rest of my life. I will guard this nation with all that I have. I will guard its honor just as I would guard my own. Just as I would watch over my dreams to forever live in this beloved land. Whoever dares mess with Indonesia, messes with me! That day, we stood upon the earth but reached so close to the sky. As close as could be to the Almighty Creator. Friendship, dreams, hope and love. No one could fathom the vastness of it all. But just as one would dream, we all need only to believe. Thank you for everything, Genta. Let's throw Genta into the lake! Nah. Too tired. Yeah, I don't feel like it. I'm totally beat. I don't want to either. -Hey, careful! -Careful, Ple! All for Riani! One, two, three! -Is it cold, Ta? -What do you think? What the hell. Let's just do it. Wait for me, Ple! Hey, wait for me. Wait up. No way for a banana-boat not to jump into the water. The whale is diving in. Whale incoming! The Mahameru journey was not one of nature, -Where do you think you're going? -but one of hearts instead. And the beauty of Ranu Kumbolo convinced us to spend one more night. You work out every day and still cried on the peak. That was the first time I've ever seen him cry. He had the shittiest face. -Guys. -Yeah, Ian? What is it, Chubby? I've decided not to go to Manchester. What? Why? It's way better here in Indonesia. You said you were sick of everything Indonesian. Sick of the people. Sick of the government. I'm no longer sick of it. Besides, if they weigh you, they'd never allow you to board the cabin. They'd pack you straight off the cargo. You told us not to laugh so loud in the mountains. Seriously, though. It's way better here in Indonesia. I've just realized it. Most importantly, all my friends are here. I've lived here since I was born. I've occupied its earth, drank its water. How can I not be thankful for that? It is better here. Our own home. And once again, love proves its strength. Thanks for everything, Ta. We're often on our own like this, aren't we? As if we're the group's parents. While everybody's asleep, we're still up talking. -Riani. -Yes, Ta? Do you remember? Whenever the two us are together, we are more than just friends. When I went with you to see a movie, just the two of us. When we discussed the film. And there were many other things that we've done together, just the two of us. We've been friends for years, and suddenly a new feeling crops up. A feeling that is more than just between friends. I didn't know how to express it. I was afraid of losing you as a best friend. I've really missed you, Riani. There wasn't a single day that passed by without me thinking about you during the three months we were apart. But now... after conquering the peak of Mount Mahameru with you under the starry skies of Ranu Kumbolo... l am no longer uncertain. I love you, Riani. Thank you, Ta. But... you're not the one, Ta. You're not the one who's in my heart. That man is-- That man is Zafran, Ta. I've kept my feelings hidden from him for the longest time. I am so very sorry, Ta. FOREVER TOGETHER THE FIVE OF US And one by one, we took responsibility over our dreams. Peace be upon you. Good afternoon. My name is Adrian Adriano. My thesis is titled The Impact-- Ian never did land the whale job at the marine park. He is now a bachelor degree graduate. Genta, having had too many meetings in cafes, eventually built an office that looks like a cafe. It's awesome. Hello, sir? I don't think I can meet you at a cafe today. How about we meet up at my office? We'll do the presentation as well. That's onion. Indy, you eat it. And Arial, the one most terrified of women, outpaced us all. Indy told me that when Arial proposed, it was the sweetest thing. As sweet as sweet-soy-sauce. A FEW YEARS LATER And Riani-- Zafran! Riani is the reason Zafran was brought into this world. Riani is all of my poems and dreams coming true. The Zafran today is one that always endeavors to become a better man each and every day. Years have passed and yet we still hang out at the same place. The only difference being there's more of us around. -Hi, Happy. How are you? -Hello, Happy. Here you go, Dad. These? Not one of "those." The five of us believe in one thing. A simple thing, but amazing nonetheless. It is in the heart of every man, if he would only believe in it. A dream. Whenever you have a dream or aspiration, place it right here. Right by your forehead. Don't let it stick. Let it hover. Let it float 5 cm before you. So that it never leaves your sight. And you carry your dream with you every single day. Gaze at it each day and believe that you can. That you will get up each time you fall. Whatever the obstacles, tell yourself that you believe in your dreams and that you will never give up. There has never been any evidence by numbers that science can prove, on how the miracles of dreams, friendship, love and faith, could create so many changes that transform the lives of men. The evidence has never existed. Only dreams and faith could set mankind aside from other beings. Genta. Hello, Dinda. How's your post-graduate studies? The usual. Back in college, plenty of assignments, papers. What kind of paper? Economics. Macro or micro? Micro. Only dreams and faith serve as reasons mankind is put in a special place before the eyes of the Creator. And what these beings called humans could do in regards to their dreams and faith is that they need only to believe. Believe in the 5 cm in front of you.
