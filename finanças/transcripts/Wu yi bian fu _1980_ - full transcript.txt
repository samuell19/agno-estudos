I was the one who hired the Ghost King... to kill Shangguan I've something very important to do I need a favor from you But I want someone... who is a real expert So you sent the Ghost King to test me Right. If you couldn't kill the Ghost King, you wouldn't be able to kill Bat without Wings He is still alive? I bet you know what happened at... Hungfa temple in Mount Wudang 5 years ago It's said he did die that day There is such rumor in the boxer world But my father took... the Bat Blades to the frontier and he never returned The Bat is the only one... who wants my father dead for revenge Your father is... Szma Zhongyuan of Szma Villa So you're Szma Dongcheng People always talked about you a few years ago I'm here to ask you to find out... where my father is In other words, I want to know if the Bat is really dead Many people are here today Are you looking for me too?

Venomous Wuxie, the Stun-dude I'm the poisonous Dr. Wang Wuxie I'm the grim & bewitching Xu Fang Another 2 excellent assassins are here Did someone hire you to kill me?

Yes Did you ask my daughter Lei-feng... to see you at Tianlung Temple? Your daughter? Sir, I didn't even know you How could I know your daughter? I'm Lei Xun of Zhenyuan Security Bureau He's my daughter's fiance, Han Shen Did you see the Bat without Wings? What? The Bat without Wings again? Right At the Maple Wood, my boxers... were killed by a man called the Bat without Wings But before he killed my men, he gave a letter to my daughter saying that you'd see my daughter at the temple "Tianlung Temple" Lei-feng... Lei-feng... Actually I myself have come here for the first time I didn't ask your daughter to see me here Look Matter to discuss at the Tianlung Temple By Xiao Qi This isn't my handwriting This is a check with my handwriting The handwriting of his name is different It must be the Bat deceiving... Lei-feng to come here Lei-feng... Weird! I heard that the Bat died 5 years ago How could he appear again? And get me involved? Did you see Lei-feng? No There're only trees inside Mr Lei, no matter what happens, Miss Lei won't be here I think you'd better go home first Maybe she's safe and home now "Zhunyuan Security Bureau" Cai Cai... Who is it? It's me You're... Who is it? Keeper Feng! Don't you recognize me? Our lady? Right. It's me Great. The master is looking for you everywhere I know I know he's looking for me That's why I send my head back to him Here is my head Please give it to my father Help! Someone please help! What's the matter? The lady... The lady? Where? It's her Lady... Where's she? Look! Over there Look! That's her... Lady... Go Where's the lady's left hand? Keeper Feng! Feng-erh! Where are you? Uncle I remember on the hill near the temple There's a aunt Zheng living there Feng and I used to go there as children Wouldn't Lei-feng have gone to her house? Okay. Let's go Mr. Xiao, we'll be right back Okay You're... I'm lost Excuse me, which way should I go to head west? Are you going to the Tianlung Temple?

Uncle, something is weird We'd better go back to the security bureau Old sir Thank you Are you alright? I'm fine The blind usually tend to stumble What the hell! Do you think my arm is pretty? Yes As pretty as a woman's hand Let me give it to you then This is the arm of Lei-feng Aren't you blind? Of course not Where's my daughter? Apart from the arm, I've sent the rest of her to the security bureau Who the hell are you? Me? People call me the Bat without Wings Didn't you die 5 years ago? Do I look like a dead person? The Broken-heart Sword Xiao Qi is really good It's almost dawn. I need to leave now Goodbye The Bat He's the Bat without Wings? I don't know Only a few people have seen him before "Zhunyuan Security Bureau" - Feng-erh... - Lei-feng... Master, you can't go... Why? Because she's cut into pieces Her head is cut off as well What? Lei-feng... Hold up the master Get him some medicine. Hurry up Hurry up Did your lady come back without an arm? How could you know? Because I met the Bat without Wings... in the Maple Wood What? Sir, where did you go? I was looking for the Bat for revenge Do you know where's he? I don't know I heard of the duel at the frontier that year 26 boxers were killed by the Bat Only the Iron Palm, Szma Zhongyuan and the... thousand-faced Scholar, Leng Qiuyun were alive Szma was missing at the frontier lately So Leng Qiuyun is the only one left I'm going to see Leng now Strange! Why're there many people here tonight? Hold it These people are dead What? They're really dead people The Bat knew we will pass here if we're looking for Mr. Leng He's giving us a warning here Look Wang Wuxie, Xu Fang They're the top killers Only few boxers can tackle them You're right Who is it? Who's hiding here? Come out... No one is speaking here at all The one who speaks has been here already Well, who's really dead? Who's faking to be dead? It's clear now How could you know they're speaking? Many people know ventriloquism Their lips don't need to move when speaking No wonder you're famous in the boxer world But it's pity you like to meddle in affairs You want to see my lifting skills They forced us to the river bank on purpose Right My nickname is the Venomous Wuxie In the pond I've put... the most poisonous drug of... our Tang School Once you touch the water, your whole body will be swollen to death There's nothing in the pond. Not even a leaf You've nowhere to stand on and you're surely dead It looks as if they knew... we're looking for thousand-faced Scholar Let's hurry for the Leng's Garden now Look "Spiritual Tablet of Leng Qiuyun" How could he be dead as well? Once again their moves proved to be faster We're late Right You're late Unfortunately my lord suddenly died of a disease... 3 days ago He didn't have many friends when he's alive But when he died, many came looking for him Seems like there's more than one dead person here Why are there so many dead people? How do you know they're dead? Stop Please stop Are you the Broken-heart Sword Xiao Qi? Yes, I am So you're not from the Bat's gang We're here to look for the Bat Why? Because his daughter was killed by the Bat He seeks the Bat for revenge But we're late I never expected Mr. Leng to be dead The people here are strange... just like them Those who should have died are still alive! Do you want to see Leng Qiuyun? Follow me Old sir, are you bringing us to see Mr. Leng? Where's he now? He's here In fact I wasn't dead I just try to defend myself against the Bat So I pretended that I was dead You do believe that the Bat is still alive? Yes Because the Bat didn't die at all He got hit in the forehead... by the Iron Palm of Mr. Szma... and fainted He became insane... after he gaining consciousness He didn't remember anything To maintain peace amongst people... we announced that he's dead In fact we locked him on the Bamboo Island Bamboo Island? Right It's an isolated island It's very close to the Szma Villa Szma is an expert in setting up the traps He sets up traps and land mines on the island Even a expert fighter... can't get there easily I really don't understand He's a mad man How could he possibly escape? How can you be sure that it must be him? If it wasn't him, who can kill Szma Zhongyuan? Who stole the Bat Blades of Szma Dongcheng? You say, the blade which Szma Dongcheng lost... is the Bat Blade Right I believe it's that Bat Blade It's said that there're a pair of Bat Blades The Bat carried them wherever he went That's the treasure that... many boxers want to have it How could Dongcheng get it? It's a long story You probably knew that... the Bat has kidnapped many pretty women He raped and then killed them Among those hundreds of victims, there're only 2 exceptions I heard that these 2 women... too pretty to be spared The Bat let them go... and gave away his blades to both of them One of them is Szma Dongcheng Who is the other one? Lei-feng It's not Lei-feng It's my fiancee No one knows this secret It's because of her I risked my life fighting against the Bat Strange! She looks like my daughter Maybe that's why... the Bat kidnapped your daughter Where's she now? Sorry For her safety, I cannot tell you Why? I heard that there's a big secret... regarding these two Bat Blades Now Miss Szma has lost her blade, I'm afraid... someone has got plans for her blade Fine Anyway, we're looking for the Bat only It would be better if you keep silent I don't want any misunderstanding Well, we shouldn't have disturbed you Thanks for your information Goodbye See you You go ahead in this direction Passing Lingding Isle, you'll see Bamboo Island We saw a road here a moment ago Why are there bamboos blocking the road here? Right, I feel like when we're making our way, the bamboo is moving with us at the same time Right The bamboo is moving along What? Have you heard of the Taoist magic? Yeah sure There're few people in the boxer world... knowing the tricks Probably Szma Zhongyuan is one of them What is Taoist magic? It's the same as a trap But it's very crafty It combines the tricks of Taoist magic... with mechanical switchboards, producing many forms of traps... Iocking people inside Like now for instance It seems as if we're close to the balcony But no matter how hard we try we couldn't prop the boat across The traps under the water... and the bamboos... will block our way automatically No wonder Szma Zhongyuan managed... to lock the Bat here Look! The Bat without Wings Szma Zhongyuan is really good He's helped us to cross the water If anyone tried to rescue the Bat, he'd be surely dead What should we do? Get to the shore first How could we? Taoist magic is beyond our understanding It seems to know everything There's only one way to break it And that's to go against it We go that way if we want to go to the balcony Come on There're traps everywhere Is he the Bat without Wings? Look at the chains. He's probably the Bat No He doesn't look like the one in Maple Wood Let's take a look there The water is toxic Many people must have died here Dead without permission It's made of iron Guess we should climb up the bamboo ...to get there like we do before I think it's the only way out We're trapped again Surely we are, because... the traps are moving under the water again Who are you? Don't you know who I am? I'm the Bat without Wings Why did you kill my daughter? Where's he? I saw someone throwing darts at us But there's no way outta here Strange! Where did the people go? It's a nice house Who owns it? Who are you, sir? You enter Szma Villa without informing Do you have something important? Szma Villa? Yes This is my house Mr. Xiao and Mr. Lei Why did you come out over there? We tried to catch the Bat on Bamboo Island But he escaped through a tunnel in a small house We went after him... but unexpectedly turned up here Really? So what, the Bat isn't dead? Right The Bat without Wings didn't die The traps on the Bamboo Island... were set up by our master... to imprison the Bat For our convenience to look after that idiot ...he made this underground tunnel No matter what Since you gentlemen are here Please let me serve you with wine Hope you'll have a good stay here Please Thanks Oh! Mr. Lei, how do you suddenly find out... the Bat is on the island? Mr. Leng Qiuyun told us If I guess right, the Bat has already escaped... from the island Because I just saw it's another one there Really? It may have connection to... my father's death at the frontier Anyway... it's already dark now Please stay here for a night... and leave tomorrow Sleep late to enjoy the moonlight Rise early to tend to flowers It's late. Why don't you go to bed, Miss Szma? Is it because of your fondness of the moon? No It's quiet in the villa Since my father left, no one ever visited us So whenever there's a full moon, I'm always here to think about the past Still missing Hero Linghu? You know our relationship? Everyone in the boxer world knows... ...you're a perfect match Unfortunately, the Bat abducted you Hero Linghu tried to save you... and went to the frontier But he's killed by that madman Linghu Tian and my father went to the frontier... it wasn't because of me Because he believed... the Bat never hurt me The reason I accompanied your father was because your father told me... the Bat kept two kungfu manuals If I couldn't destroy them, it'd be a... disaster for the martial world But there are already 7 people Why did you have to go? Dongcheng... A great man should plan and worry ahead and enjoy the fruits after the people How can I let the other folk alone? Promise me you must come back I'll come back He said he'll be back But he didn't He wants to look for the manuals But I couldn't fulfill his last wish Boxers are always looking for fame and money Hero Linghu is very exceptional It's no doubt whenever there's a full moon you'll miss him Well... the night is deep and the fog heavy I speak too much I think it's already mid-night You'd better go to bed Tomorrow we bid farewell Please... Mr. Lei... In the small house on Bamboo Island you remember ...there's a pair of stone deer? There's a pair over at the Tianlung Temple too Do you think... they look the same? Now that you remind me Do you mean the deer in the temple ...has the same mechanism? "Tianlung Temple" May I know who is coming? Please show up It looks like... tonight someone has invited us... to come here on purpose Look! What a big stone statue! This painting... Didn't we see it in Mr. Leng's house? Could it possibly be that... One of these two statues is Miss Szma Other one is the mysterious lady Leng mentioned Possibly It must be the home of the Bat Who's the mysterious woman in yellow? If we can locate her, we may find out the Bat... and his secret If this is the home of the Bat, he must bring all the girls... back to here Let's check the place out We may find some clues Right Come and take a look Lei-feng wore this the other day Am I right? Right Her mother embroidered the edge for her I think when she died... she was tied up here Look! This was Lei-feng's handwriting Probably she wrote it before she died Ximen What Ximen? Could it be Ximen Luoye? Ximen Luoye Mr. Lei, how do you know? There are 2 pretty women in the martial world One is Szma Dongzheng The other one is Ximen Luoye Ximen family is very reputed in boxer world They've very strict discipline No one ever saw her Do you know where she is now? The aristocratic Ximen family was withered... and completely declined It has lost its glamour I heard Miss Ximen stays in Shiau Shiang house somewhere in the suburbs of Hanzhou "Shiau Shiang House" Thank you, miss Xi-erh Except you, no one talks to me... all these years It's not true Who then? Me You? I've not seen you for 5 years But you're as pretty as before What are you doing here? I need the Bat's Blade that you kept Why did you kill them? To keep their mouths shut I guessed right You're not the Bat without Wings Ms. Ximen is really clever as the people say If you don't want to die, hand out the Bat's Blade But if you kill me, you will never get the Blade, too How can you say... I will never get the Blade? Master We got the Bat Blade Miss Ximen Do you really think I'm here for the Blade? It's just a plot... to lure you out here My men have already got it I just lied I asked my guys to do a small trick and you fell into my trap so easily and showed me the Blade You... You're really beautiful No wonder that madman was fond of you Stop or I'll kill myself Are you sure? No way Miss Ximen... Go Miss Ximen... Here How are you? Don't touch me I've no hope If you're here for the Bat Blade, you're late Who has come? The Bat without Wings He's taken the Blade away But the Bat isn't the real one What? Then who is he? What? Him? Miss Ximen... Xiao Qi I never imagined you to be faster than us C'mon, hand it over As it is the Blade isn't here since long We're busy, you search for yourself Stop Mr. Lei, don't tie up with them Leave here immediately Yes Go Chase Big brother, please Our plan is successful It's lucky that you came in time or Xiao Qi will discover that... I pretended dead by holding my breath Okay, let them fight each other and we may take the advantage of the result Dad, you're back? Here's the Blade Is it the Blade of the Ximen family? It's strange Xiao Qi had gone to Ximen's house They met Leng Qiuyun Did Leng tell them everything? I think... Leng is a very mysterious person Since he's back from the frontier, he's been avoiding everyone Right Did Ximen Luoye tell Xiao... who you are? No When they went there, Ximen Luoye had killed herself Killed herself? Come on Bring out the other Bat Blade Dad, both the Blades are here now Let's find out... where the secret is hidden Temple, Lung Tian Tianlung Temple Right I'd already guessed their stuff... were hidden under the Tianlung Temple But I searched thoroughly Still I couldn't find it The name of the temple was carved on the blade It must be inside the temple Why don't you bring the madman to help you? Right, he could help Men Dad If you find the kungfu manuals, promise me that you'll destroy it I want to fulfill the will of brother Linghu Don't worry I tried hard to find the Blades... is because of you Come on... Go... Master, here's your clothes Go... Where's the master? He took the madman away from the back door What's the matter? Xiao Qi is here suddenly What? Miss Szma... Mr. Xiao, why are you here... at this late hour? We're looking for someone in here Who? The Bat without Wings Ask Szma Zhongyuan out Miss Ximen told me everything... before she died She's the only one who knew... who is the Bat Szma Dongcheng Call your dad to compensate the death of my daughter Szma Dongcheng You're from a reputed boxer family How could you do this? I don't think... it's the right time to discuss this Go now Stop You probably know... how powerful our trap is You're now in the middle of the mine trap All the bamboo around you carry dynamite The four strings of this instrument... is the lead linked to the trap If I just snap the string... you'll be blown into pieces Probably you regret meddling with affairs Miss Szma, you are good and refined Why did you help your father... to do such an evil thing? What evil thing you talking about? The reason he tried hard to get the Blades... was to help me to... fulfill the last will of brother Linghu; That of destroying the manuals What? He needed the Bat Blade... in order to find the manuals? Of course What do you think he did all this for? Didn't you know... the secret on the Blades is... about the biggest treasured vault in boxer world? Money is all he goes after Who told you this? Miss Ximen told me before she died She's talking nonsense You've nowhere to go You will die... in this mine trap It's enough Don't kill them Why? Because what they said is true What? It was for riches your dad went after the blade In order to refresh the memory of the Bat, In the Maple Wood, he kidnapped Lei-feng... who looks exactly as Miss Ximen Pushing Mr. Xiao and Lei to visit Leng Qiuyun, he asked me to pretend as a ghost and to carry Lei-feng's head ...to the Zhenyuan Security Bureau They'd be at the Tianlung Temple now, urging... the Bat to disclose the place of hidden treasure Well... is it there? No Old folk Think again Those white stuff One by one in a row like this Those yellow and green stuff Piece by piece Yellow? Green? No No? No Oh! Yes! Where are they? Tell me These two women I love most The one in yellow is called Ximen Luoye The one in green is Szma Dongcheng Think about it now or I'll ruin the two most favorite women... in your life Don't ruin them... They're the women I love most There's a lot of money under their skirts Don't hurt them What did you say? I'll let you in on a secret Don't tell anyone else Okay I put all the jewelry... in the skirts... of my most beloved women In the skirts? Under the skirts Come on Go up now The belt. Inside the belt Not the belt In the yellow skirt Come down... What a treasure! It's a gold vault too All these years of hard work is worthwhile Dad Aren't you looking for the Bat's kungfu manuals here? Why are you here? Wu Liang told me everything I don't believe it I thought because of the manuals ...you looked for the Bat Blades I never thought... Silly girl Don't listen to the bullshit I've found the treasured vault Szma Villa will be the most reputed... and wealthy family in boxer world A pity that you stopped at nothing to get money Who brought you here? It's me You... I didn't believe my father to be such a person I want them to witness that my dad... actually came for the manuals. Called them to... see you're trying get rid of the dirt in boxer world I wanted them to see... my father is a real hero Hero? Hero? How much does a hero worth? When a man becomes old and weak, you'll know... how much is a hero worth! I tell you the truth In fact, 10 years ago I let the Bat kidnap you on purpose So I can get the Bat Blade... to find the treasured vault You... But it's fine... I finally get what I want Don't get closer I just stroke her acupuncture point on the shoulder She can't move for a couple of hours Didn't want her to interfere when I kill you All of you are useless You three aren't satisfied yet You'll be dead too in a minute How could you be so confident? Because I'm holding the Bat Blade The Blade is extremely sharp Every one says so in the boxer world How could this sword...? The Pearl Sword is the lethal weapon It can counter the Bat Blade The Venomous Wuxie The Poisonous Doctor What? You still alive? Of course If I was to die, all these years of hard work will be wasted You are here... for the treasured vault too? Correct We've the same kind of... reputation being righteous gentlemen in boxer world We will do anything... to cheat the treasure vault... from those so-called notorious scumbags It's a pity too... our plan wasn't successful completely We both got only a Bat Blade I realized later... you've plan on Ximen Luoye So I turned your trick against you I gave the Blade to you... and you'd find the treasured vault for us Now I come to get the treasured vault You shameless bastard... Don't say that From now on, both of us will be... the most reputed gentlemen in martial world From now on, consider yourself all to be dead No one will ever know what happened here I'll be a reputed gentlemen... as before Why are you so sure we're gonna die here today? Because the darts I threw here... a moment ago It carried the most poisonous substance... that can make people go crazy You all draw it in your body When the poison starts reacting You'll be laughing non-stop ...until you are dead Your poison? The faster you move, The faster the poison reacts Your poison is really strong Get the vault Yes Listen, everyone go together Go Stop there You... Me? I'm not poisoned When you threw the darts, I already realized there's something wrong I held my breath and covered my nose When I saw you taking off your mask I knew it's safe to breath Otherwise as you said...
