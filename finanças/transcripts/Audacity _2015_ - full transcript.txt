¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre le! ¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta! [shrieks] [glass breaking] Help! (male) The time has come for change. For far too long in this country, too many of us have been afraid to speak up about the things that matter. The time for change is now, so we're gonna change American football to rugby. And, uh... ...helmets are for wimps. [audience booing] (male) All right, sorry. Joking about the president, okay. Joking about football, okay, my bad. The one that I'd love to actually see as the president would be someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know? Imagine him trying to fix the problem. "You don't worry about the Hummers," you know? "I used to drive one, come on. It's fantastic." I love Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's done a movie recently with Sylvester Stallone. Sylvester Stallone, "You know, I'm wondering, you know, would you like a cameo in my latest movie?" And Arnie's like, "I'm too busy for a cameo. But how 'bout a small part?" We get call centers ring us in Australia. I don't know if it's the same here. This guy rang me up the other day. He's like, "Excuse me, Mr. Price." I thought it was my friend doing King Julien. I'm like, "Oh, the New York Giants, oh, ha-ha! "I like to move it, move it. I like to move it, move it. Ohh!" It was one of those calls. He said, "Are you interested in doing a short survey?" I said, "I'm not interested." "Okay, question number two. Why not?" "I'm not interested." "Number three, would you ever consider--" "No!" "Thank you. Come again." If I offend some of you guys, it's not my intention 'cause I want to offend everybody equally, if that's okay. [slow clapping] I'm here for the autograph. Not yours. Thank you, man. Ahh. Take my bag. No, no, no. I'm union, I'd better not. So, I thought they were gonna waterboard you for the rugby thing. Yeah, I know. It was a risk, a risk I was willing to take. - Heh-heh. - No risk, no reward, huh? So when are you gonna get up on stage and do something? Me? Uh, next week. Oh, never, that's what I meant. Never, yeah. No, seriously, you've got some good stuff. - You should. - Well, you laugh at anything. Well, true, but then again, I am just being polite, right? Well, what do I owe you for that inspiration, Tony Robbins? No, look, seriously, man, seriously. I just wanna be the first to throw something at you. Well, you know who liked that joke? Nobody. Nobody. Oh, thanks. Thank you. (female) So I noticed you've been talking with the new guy at work. Peter, right? Yeah. He actually went to high school with me. He used to race bikes. Motorcycles? No, bicycles. Like Lance Armstrong. Oh, cool. He must like his job then. He's doing bike deliveries, right? Yup, he's a mailman on wheels. [laughing] I also noticed that he's been hanging around the guy that sounds like the Crocodile Hunter. Yeah, Ben. He's Peter's buddy. He grew up in Australia. I'm actually becoming good friends with both of them. Because our departments somewhat overlap, we spend quite a bit of time together at the office. Ben moonlights as a comedian. He's hilarious. [gasps] Oh no! What? Hailey, Ben's show was tonight, and I totally forgot. Oh, no. He's especially been getting on me about going to this, and I promised I would go. (Hailey) Ooh, busted. I can't believe I forgot. I gotta text him right away. Ugh! [speaking in Australian accent] "I'm so sorry. I beg your forgiveness." [laughing] So were you and Peter good friends in high school? No, not really. We didn't even really know each other. He was just in one of my classes. He was pretty popular, kind of known for being a partier. He's different now, though, there's-- Something's changed. I don't really know what it is. People change. Yeah, they definitely do. (male news announcer) For some, the legalization of gay marriage is good news, while others find it difficult to grasp. Regardless of what anyone thinks about the issue, gay marriage has become a present-day reality that is spreading across America. Soon, to one degree or another, each of us will have to respond in our own way to this current cultural revolution. Hi, Peter. Can't believe you're still here. What time's your first delivery? I'm still trying to wake up. (Diana) Oh, Ben's show was last night. No wonder you're tired. How was it? Oh, it was great. He did so great. Uh, he says you do that too. You're supposed to be pretty good. He said that? I didn't say that. He said that? I wouldn't say that. - No. - Can you do one? No. No, no, no, no. - Come on. - No. - Oh, come on. - No, no, no, no. Peter, just do like, just a little one. No. Nobody's here. Please? Come on. (Peter) I'm not--I'm not very good. That's okay. All right. Are you familiar with Russell Crowe, the crazy guy, throws phones at people? - Yes. - All right. - I can't do him. - Oh, come on! I can't do him, but I got a mean Popeye. I got a mean Popeye. Wow. Oh, man, I gotta go soon. Oh, wow. Are you gonna be on time this time? I better, 'cause I'm surprised they're letting me do this again. Everyone makes mistakes. [laughing] Yeah, that's true. How many times have you run out of gas? It's like three or four. Okay. No, shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. It's seven? It was eight-ish. - No. - It was in the eights. - No, it was, like, once. - Well, who's keeping count? [laughing] [under her breath] You. What are you looking at? (Peter) It's the Bible. Oh. So you're religious? Well, I'm a Christian. Since when? Like, a year--year? Yeah, a year ago. Mm-hmm. So you, like, believe it, like, you know, that it's all true? Yeah. Yeah, every word. So do you believe gay people should be stoned? Of course not. (Diana) Well, your book says that. No, no. Actually, I was reading yesterday in-- You know what? I don't wanna offend you, but I have a sister who's gay. And you don't know the struggle she's been through from people who are telling her that she's gonna go to hell for, what, loving someone? And you have the audacity to tell me that she's going to hell? Go on, say it. Oh, man. Um-- I'm sorry. I gotta go. I gotta go. I'm sorry. (Diana) "So do you believe gay people should be stoned?" Whoa! (Peter) Sorry, sorry, sorry! Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it hold it, hold it, ooh. [laughing] [giggling] You two look happy. Oh, we're getting our application for our marriage license. Can you believe that we're actually doing this? (female) I know. Oh, did you call the florist? You know what, we'll just go there next. (female) Okay. (female #2) I feel like there's so much to do, and it's gonna be here before you know it. (female) I know. That's a really cool bag. Are you a bike messenger? Yeah, yeah. So what's your message? No, I'm a bike delivery person. It's a--I don't deliver bikes. I--um... I guess, bike messenger sounds better than bike delivery person. [elevator bell dings] (Peter) Stamps Armstrong. Well, have a nice day. (Peter) Yeah, you too. Stamps Armstrong. [elevator creaking, clanging] [grunting] (male operator) Hello, is there a problem? (Peter) Yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator. The doors won't open. I'm halfway down the floor. (operator) Okay, there's been a malfunction. Yeah. (operator) Try pressing the door open button. It's not working. It's not doing anything. It won't open. I mean, the doors are open but--slightly. (operator) Hang on, I'm entering a code. Okay, now try pushing the doors open. All right, the doors are open. Thanks. (operator) Okay, now I want you to wait there until the repair crew arrives. Don't let anyone in. What? No, no, no. I have to go. I have to deliver a package. (operator) You don't understand. Someone could die. I'll figure something out. I can't wait here, okay? (operator) Hey, this is serious. You need to warn people. You cannot leave. Hey, can anybody help me? Is there anybody here? All right. What's this? Hey! You gotta stay and watch this elevator for me. If anybody gets on this elevator, they're gonna die. So just stay here, make sure nobody gets on. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. (female) I still can't believe that we're getting married. [laughing] I never thought that I'd be holding this application. Oh, there's a café down on the second floor. Let's just eat there. And then the florist isn't too far from here. (female #2) Sounds good. (female) What do you think your brother is going to say? (female #2) I don't know, but he's going to have to say something now. [laughing] [screaming] Noooo! Noooo! Noooo! [screaming] [elevator crashing] No, no! Ah! (male announcer) Ray Comfort's been talking with people on the street about what they believe for years. He's not afraid to ask some very personal questions, and as a result, he gets some very interesting answers. Watch this. (Ray Comfort) I noticed when I came up, you two were kissing in public. You are obviously gay. Do you think homosexuals should be allowed to be married? Definitely, 100%. (Ray Comfort) Are you two married? Um, no, we're not married. (Ray Comfort) Are you thinking of getting married? Yes. (Ray Comfort) What do you think of gay marriage? I love gay marriage. I have a lot of gay friends. I love the gay community, and I think everybody should be able to love who they wanna love, no matter if you love a woman or a man, who cares? (Ray Comfort) What do you think of gay marriage? I'm not opposed to it. Gay marriage, I think they should be able to do whatever they want. I think that everyone should be free to marry who they want. (Ray Comfort) Do you think it's morally okay to be gay? Yes, it is. It's not a lifestyle. It's not a choice. It's who you are. You can't help the fact that you love a man, you can't help the fact that you love a woman. (Ray Comfort) Do you think it's morally okay? Sure. I think it is morally okay. It's their choice. They have the same rights as everyone else. Love is love. Who cares who you love as long as you're happy. (Ray Comfort) Are you gay? I am. (Ray Comfort) Are you gay? I am gay, yes. (Ray Comfort) You gay? - Yes. (Ray Comfort) When did you discover you were gay? Last year. (Ray Comfort) Do you think people are born gay? No. (Ray Comfort) So it's-- they choose to be gay? Yes, I think they choose to be gay. (Ray Comfort) Are people born that way? I believe so. I was. (Ray Comfort) Do you think people are born gay? Yes, definitely. (Ray Comfort) Do you think people are born with tendencies to commit adultery? Um, I don't-- No, I don't believe so. (Ray Comfort) What about to fornicate? No. (Ray Comfort) I was born with those tendencies. Everyone's born with a desire to do what we wanna do even if, you know, even if it's wrong. I know adultery's wrong and fornication's wrong, but I still wanted to do it. I was born like it. Couldn't help it. The desires overtook me. But it doesn't make it right. Does that make sense? That does make sense. (Ray Comfort) I was born that way. You were? (Ray Comfort) Yeah, right from the time I was a little kid, when I saw girls, I wanted to be with one. Most guys are like that, they got red blood in their veins. I mean, women are attractive. Yeah, we are. (Ray Comfort) So we're kind of born that way in the sense we like to do that which is wrong. Fornicate and commit adultery, comes naturally to us. Does that make sense? It does. (Ray Comfort) So do you think the same--it's the same with homosexuality? People are born with a nature that does what they wanna do rather than what God says? Yes. (Ray Comfort) Do you think they're born that way? They're born that way. (Ray Comfort) You sure? You think people are born adulterers? - Are born what? - Adulterers. Like, they cheat? (Ray Comfort) Yeah, wanting to cheat on people. It's in our human nature. (Ray Comfort) It's in our human nature? Yeah. (Ray Comfort) You think people are born fornicators? [laughing] Um... (Ray Comfort) What do you think? Actually, it is choice. It is choice. (Ray Comfort) Choice? You've changed your mind? Yeah, you just--yeah. You enlightened me real fast. Honestly, this is actually a very good argument. (Ray Comfort) Does that make sense? Yes. - That makes sense, yeah. - Sure, it makes sense. (Ray Comfort) Does that make sense? Makes sense, yeah. The way you're saying it, logically, it makes sense. (Diana) You know, it was so inexpensive, and it's the same as the one we saw in the mall the other day. It looks so cute on you. Thank you. I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. (Peter) That shirt looks sooo cute on you. (Diana) Stop, you are such a creeper. Huh-huh-huh. [laughing] Hey, this is gonna sound strange. Do you have a sister? (Diana) Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do. Is she gay? No. Why do you ask? I had a dream last night. (Diana) About my sister? She's married with kids. I gotta ask you another question too. Okay. What do you think of gay marriage? Well, I think that people who love each other should have the right to get married. Don't you? I think there's more to it than that. I'm a Christian, and the Bible-- The Bible says a lot of stuff, though. I mean, doesn't it say that God sends gay people to hell? You're missing the point. Jesus came to save people from hell. (Diana) Don't get me wrong. I believe in God. It's just that my God doesn't damn people to hell just 'cause they're different. Let me show you something. This is a Christian talking to a gay couple. (Diana) I'd really rather not. These people are so condescending and judgmental and I just-- Why is the Bible so against sex? The Bible's not against sex. The whole thing starts with God telling two naked people to have sex. They're literally halfway home. And I know there are psychos out there holding up hateful signs about gay people, but most Christians aren't like that. That's not even Christian. Watch how it ends. (Ray Comfort) Anything else you'd like to say? - No, thank you. - You finished? Yep, I'm all good. Thank you for being so, I guess, kind and understanding and not very judgmental about it. Fine. (Ray Comfort) Do you believe in God? Yes, I believe in God. (Ray Comfort) What does God think of homosexuality? I think God is okay with homosexuality. (Ray Comfort) So what does God think of homosexuality? That's a stupid question. I think He should just stay out of it. (Ray Comfort) Are you a spiritual person? I am. I believe in God. (Ray Comfort) Okay, so what does God think of homosexuality? He thinks it's a sin. He thinks it's wrong. He frowns upon it, but He still loves me at the end of the day since we're all sinners. I know God wants people to be happy. Since I didn't choose my sexual orientation, so then why would He-- If He really didn't like gay people, why would He allow them to roam around the earth so free? (Ray Comfort) Well, the same reason He allows adulterers and fornicators and liars and thieves to roam around the earth. That's from the Christian Bible. It's 1 Corinthians chapter 6, verses 9 and 10. Could you read it out loud? It says, "Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves will inherit the kingdom of God." (Ray Comfort) What do you think of that verse? That one's really complicated. (Ray Comfort) It says, "Adulterers won't inherit God's kingdom, nor will fornicators, nor will homosexuals." So what do you think of that? Um, it's a nice verse. I'm glad you told that to me. (Ray Comfort) Could I give you a Bible verse to read and see what you think of it? No. (Ray Comfort) Did you hear the second word? It says, "idolaters." Do you know what that means? I do not. (Ray Comfort) Well, an idolater is somebody who makes up a god in their own image. It's a violation of the first and the second of the Ten Commandments where God says, "Number one, you shall have no other gods before Me." And the Second Commandment says, "Don't make yourself a graven image," or a false god. We tend to make a god up in our minds that we feel comfortable with, a god that doesn't mind adultery or fornication, homosexuality, lying, and stealing. And we cuddle up to that snuggly little god we feel comfortable with, but he's not the god we have to face on Judgment Day. So according to the Bible, will adulterers get into heaven? No. (Ray Comfort) Fornicators? No. (Ray Comfort) Homosexuals? No. (Ray Comfort) That's the warning of Scripture. And if you don't receive that warning, then I can't do anything for you. I'm a Christian, and I've got a dilemma. If I say, "Homosexuals won't inherit the kingdom of God," I'm called a hater, with hate speech, and intolerant. But if I say they will, I'm lying as a Christian, 'cause I believe God's Word. "Do not be deceived." (Ray Comfort) Why do you think it begins with those words? What do you think, Cody? (Ray Comfort) Why do you think the Bible begins with those words, "Don't be deceived"? (male) Do not be deceived. I don't know. (Ray Comfort) 'Cause people are deceived when it comes to this issue. Okay. I accept Christ into my heart, and that's all that I need to be able-- (Ray Comfort) Well, no, you've got to repent, turn from all sin. No lying, stealing, adultery, fornication, homosexuality. You've gotta turn from all sin. I can do that on my deathbed if I really don't believe that I'll make it. (Ray Comfort) Will homosexuals inherit the kingdom of God, according to the Bible? Absolutely not. (Ray Comfort) Thank you very much, ladies, for talking to me. I really appreciate it. No worries. (Ray Comfort) If I care about homosexuals, I'll warn them too. Does that make sense? - That makes sense, yeah. - Sure, it makes sense. (Ray Comfort) Anything else you'd like to say? - No, thank you. - You finished? Yep, I'm all good. Thank you for being so, I guess, kind and understanding and not very judgmental about it. Can I go back? I accept Christ into my heart. They were Christians. (Peter) A lot of people make professions of faith in Christ and then they just continue to live however they wanna live. It's called self-deception when we do that. Hey, thanks for letting me talk to you about this. Yeah. (Peter) Oh, I gotta--oh, Ben has a show tonight. You should come to the show. Sure. Um, before you go, I just have a quick favor to ask. My brother, Eric, has really bad cancer. He's dying and he has a wife and three beautiful kids. Why is this happening? What did he do to deserve this? I'm so angry at God. (Peter) I'm really sorry that that's happening to you. I'll definitely pray for you. Thanks. Hey, what do you think? I think they make me look cool. (female) Cool? You're trying on sunglasses from a liquor store. Cool is not possible. You need to get in here? No hurry. You two together, or do we have a line? We're together. (female) Don't stare, but do you see that guy standing over there? I've been watching him pace back and forth. There's something really weird about him. Maybe he just needs some sunglasses. I'm serious. I think he might have stolen something. You want anything? (Ben) I'm good. I don't eat before a gig. Butterflies. You eat butterflies? (Ben) Yeah, I do. [laughing] (Peter) Oh, I got a joke for you, by the way. - Yeah? - Knock, knock. - Really? - Yeah. Who's there? Interrupting starfish. Interrupting star--oh! Come on. [Peter laughs] Do you get it? - Yeah, I got it. - It's a closer. (Ben) Right in the face. How 'bout these? Get on the floor now! Get on the floor now! Get down now, get down! Everybody, get down. Get on the ground. You wanna be on the ground, or underneath it? Get down! Are those cameras on? Are they recording? No, no. Yes, yes. - No, yes, which one? - Yes, yes. Give me the cash. I need the cash now. Nobody pays with cash anymore. Aghh! (Ray Comfort) We aren't calling for the stoning of gays. We aren't calling for the stoning of anyone. Think of the woman caught in the act of adultery. They wanted to stone her to death, but she was repentant. She put her trust in Jesus, and He said, "Go your way and sin no more." [cell phone dings] [exhales] God... ...if You can hear me, please protect Peter. Open the safe or I open her skull. (Peter) No, no, no, no, no, man. (female) No, please. No, look, if you hurt her, then you gotta answer to God. (thief) What?! What are you, Mother Teresa? Huh? What, am I gonna go to hell? Hey, just leave her alone, man. Just hand me the gun. Yeah? Yeah? You want the gun? You want the gun? How about I give you my bullets instead? (Peter) No, no, no, no, no. And where are these two gonna go if I pull the trigger, huh? (Peter) No, no. Look, if you're gonna shoot somebody, shoot me. Oh God, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. Look, just don't shoot anybody, okay? Aghhh! [police sirens wailing] (thief) No, no, no, this isn't happening. This isn't happening. Who called 'em? Did you call the cops? No! Get up, get up. Get up. Shut up. Get down. Get back. All right. All right. - Get back, get back. - Help. Shut up! Put your gun down. Back off! Put it down now, and you will not get hurt. (male) Let her go. (female) Somebody help me. (male) It's not worth it, man. Let her go. (female) Help! Somebody help me. [crying] - Back off or I'll shoot her. - Let her go! She's gonna die, and it's gonna be all your fault. (male) Sir, put your weapon down now. Put your weapon down. Put it down now and let her go. No one will hurt you. (thief) Get back! Get back! I will shoot her. (male) Go, go, go, go! Move in. Move in. Hurry up. Grab the gun. Stay on the ground. Stay down. Put your hands behind your head. Aghh. Aghh-hah. Thanks, man. [cell phone dings] Thank you. (Ray Comfort) So what about you? If you were to die today, where would you go? Do you believe in an afterlife? Oh, man, I am the guy that believes in infinite possibilities. (Ray Comfort) Do you believe in God's existence? I don't really have a belief in anything, to be honest. (Ray Comfort) Now, do you think you're a good person? Absolutely. (Ray Comfort) Do you think you're a good person, Kyle? Yes. Whoa. The way I judge myself, yeah. I believe I am, yeah. I'm a fabulous person. (Ray Comfort) Do you think you're a good person? Are you gonna make it to heaven? I am gonna make it to heaven. (Ray Comfort) Do you think you'll go to heaven or hell when you die? If I don't repent of my homosexuality, I will most definitely go to hell. (Ray Comfort) You said you were a good person. Let's go through some of the Ten Commandments and see how you do. How many lies do you think you've told in your whole life? Heaps. (Ray Comfort) What about you? Heaps. I think I tell two lies a day. (Ray Comfort) Whoa! Have you ever stolen something in your whole life, even if it's small, irrespective of its value? Yes. (Ray Comfort) Have you ever stolen something, even if it's small? Yes, I have. (Ray Comfort) Now, Jesus said, "If you look at a woman and lust for her you commit adultery with her in your heart." Have you ever looked at a woman with lust? I've done that probably 15 times on the way here. (Ray Comfort) Have you ever looked at a woman with lust? I'm gay, so I do not ever look at women. (Ray Comfort) And what about you, Kyle? Yes, I sure have. (Ray Comfort) At a guy? Of course. (Ray Comfort) You ever used God's name in vain? Yes, I have. (Ray Comfort) Have you ever used God's name in vain? Yes. (Ray Comfort) Okay, that's called blasphemy. Have you done it? Well, yeah. [laughing] (Ray Comfort) Now, have you ever used God's name in vain? Um-- (Ray Comfort) "Oh my G-O-D." Oh, yeah. (Ray Comfort) It's called blasphemy when you do that. So, a little bit of bad news here. I'm not judging you, but by your own admission, you're a lying thief and a blasphemer. And you have to face God on Judgment Day. So if you face God on Judgment Day and He judges you by the Ten Commandments, are you gonna be innocent or guilty? I'll be guilty. (Ray Comfort) If He judges you by the Ten Commandments, bearing in mind by your own admission, you're a lying thief and a blasphemer, would you be innocent or guilty? Innocent. (Ray Comfort) Why? Because I'm living my life He want-- like, the way He wants me to. I'm going to school. I'm here. I'm not on drugs. I don't have a baby. I'm not married. I don't have sex every day. I do, I admit it, I should have waited 'til I got married, but I was young and dumb and I experienced it, and it was a great experience of my life. (Ray Comfort) Let's back up here. You've just told me you're a lying thief, a blasphemer, and a fornicator. I am. Yes. (Ray Comfort) And the Bible says fornicators won't inherit God's kingdom, neither will liars or thieves or blasphemers. So you're in big trouble on Judgment Day. And what about you? I'll be guilty. (Ray Comfort) Would you go to heaven or hell? I would like to think I'd go to heaven. (Ray Comfort) Well, the Bible says all liars will have their part in the lake of fire. By my standings and where I'm at right now, I will be going to hell. But I would love to go to heaven. I would hope that I wouldn't end up in hell. That sounds like I'm going to hell. (Ray Comfort) Does that concern you? Yeah, that would concern me. Yeah, on some level, for sure. (Ray Comfort) Now, what can you do to be made right with God? How can you be justified? How can you have your sins forgiven? Do you have any idea? I go to church. (Ray Comfort) Well, that won't help. You got to do something else. I'm here at school. I'm living my life. (Ray Comfort) Yeah, but so-- I'm here on earth. He put me here for a reason. (Ray Comfort) But that doesn't wash away your sins. You need a Savior. Someone who can wash away your sins, so on Judgment Day, you won't receive justice, you'll receive mercy. Because the Bible says if you die in your sins you'll end up in hell. I'd hate that to happen to you. Now, do you know what God did for guilty sinners so we wouldn't have to go to hell? Any idea? Do you know what God did so guilty sinners wouldn't have to go to hell? Any idea? No. No, what did He do? (Ray Comfort) Well, 2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, and He gave His life on the cross to take the punishment for the sin of the world. You and I violated God's law, and Jesus paid our fine. (male) If I die, either way, I'm gonna be dead. (Ray Comfort) Well, would you go-- are you sure about that? Well, nobody knows for sure. (Ray Comfort) Well, God knows. That's very true, but we haven't spoken to God. (Ray Comfort) Well, He's spoken to us through His Word. The Bible says very clearly, "It is appointed to man once to die and after this the judgment." If you stand before God on Judgment Day, in your sins, you'd be guilty and you'd end up in hell according to the Bible. That's why you need the Savior. That's why you need what Christ did on the cross. You've got to repent of all sin and trust in Jesus alone. If you're in court and someone pays your fine, the judge can dismiss your case. He can say, "This person's guilty, but they're out of here because the fine's paid." Well, God can let you live forever. He can commute your death sentence because of what Jesus did on the cross. Suffering and dying for the sin of the world and then rising from the dead. If you're in a court of law and you're guilty, the judge can say, "Oh, this person's guilty, but the fine's paid, so they're out of here." God can let you live forever because Jesus paid your fine on the cross, through His life's blood, then He rose from the dead and defeated death. What you've gotta do is repent and trust alone in Him. Turn from sin and trust in Him. It's like you trust a parachute. When you jump out of a plane, you don't try and save yourself by flapping your arms. You can't save yourself. Same with God. You've gotta trust alone in Jesus; don't try and save yourself. That's what the Bible says. Does that make sense? It does. (Ray Comfort) And what you have to do is repent and trust in Him. The minute you do that, God'll dismiss your case. He'll forgive your sins and legally grant you everlasting life. That's the good news of the gospel. Does that make sense? Yes. (Ray Comfort) Okay, summation. If you were to die today, according to the Word of God, and God gave you justice, you'd end up in hell. There are two things you have to do to be saved. You've gotta repent and trust alone in Jesus. When are you gonna do that? Starting today. (Ray Comfort) In the quietness of your heart, don't wait 'til you go to church, today repent and trust in Christ. That's what I'm saying so that you're assured of your sins being forgiven. Does that make sense? It does. I have a question for you. Can you tell that I'm a lesbian? (Ray Comfort) No. No. How would I tell that? No, I'm just saying, do we have, like, a-- do we look like a certain way? Can you tell? 'Cause you've been talking to a lesbian for the past 20 minutes. (Ray Comfort) I pray that God will lead me to the right people and He's led me to you and it's-- He did. I'm glad. (Ray Comfort) And it's been great to talk to you. Trust alone in Jesus. He's the only Savior that God has provided. Does this make sense? (male) Totally makes sense. (male) Hey, Peter. Hey, did you get done with the police report yet? Yeah, I just finished. You almost took a bullet for us in there, and, well, we wanna buy you dinner. I mean, just to go our separate ways seems kind of weird. (Peter) Thanks, but I gotta take my buddy to his comedy show. He's late. Well, is it possible for you to just drop him off and then come with us for a quick bite? It'd mean a lot to us, really. All that crime fighting has made me hungry. Great. Do you know where Tino's is? It's right down the street. Sure, yeah, I could meet you guys there, 45 minutes? Cool. All right, we'll see you then. (male) I still can't believe you did that. Can I get an iced tea please? - Yeah. - Thank you. Why would you do that? 'Cause I like iced tea. Seriously, though, you don't even know us. (male #2) You tell that guy to shoot you instead of us. Yeah, that took a lot of courage. Actually, I was terrified. But I'm a Christian, so I know where I'll go when I die. You're a Christian? You know we're gay, right? (Peter) Yeah, I figured that when I saw you guys holding hands before the guy came at you with his gun. Yeah, but don't most Christians pretty much hate gays? (Peter) No, that's not true. We don't hate anyone. Your table's ready. Wonderful. [exhales] (male #2) Well, this is a first. I can't say we've ever taken a Christian out for dinner before. You know, I actually have some questions about the Bible and what it says about being gay. Really? That's weird. I was just looking into that. Why? Why would you do that? (Peter) I had this crazy nightmare. It left me thinking that if I'm not true to what the Bible says about homosexuality, it's like not warning people about a faulty elevator before they step onto it. So if I really love people, then I have to say something. Love can't stay silent. Okay. Love. Okay, so if God is love, then why is there so much suffering and death? And if homosexuality is such an abomination, then why is the word "abomination" used to describe eating shellfish? And how come the word "homosexuality" hasn't been in the Bible until a few decades ago? Okay, one at a time. So it is true that the word "homosexuality" wasn't in there because the word hadn't been invented yet. It was coined sometime around 1900. But the original Greek word that was in there, that's the exact equivalent to the modern word of "homosexuality." I didn't know that. Okay, what about the shellfish? (female) That comes with baked potato and glazed vegetables. (male #2) No, we're just not ready to order yet. (female) Oh, okay. No rush. Could you give this to Tino, please? Look, here's something that I've been reading. One of these might answer some questions about why God allows suffering. I think you'll find both pretty useful. (male #2) Um, okay, you know what? I think we should go. What? We appreciate everything you did, but we're done here. (male) What's your problem? So he just gave us some Christian stuff. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere. What's your problem? I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this. He saved our lives. I really didn't mean to offend you guys. (male #2) Oh, I know, I know. You and every other homophobe never mean to offend, yet you still tell us that we're going to hell unless we change, and I've just heard it all before and I'm done listening. (male) Don't do this. Listen, I am not going back in the closet, and I will not deny my sexuality. (male) He didn't do anything. (male #2) It's fine. Get converted. See if I care. Do not bring that into our home. (Peter) I really didn't mean to offend you guys. (male) No, you didn't do anything. I mean, you can say whatever you want. I won't be offended. No, but I understand why he's mad. I do. Do you understand what it's like to be in our shoes? Do you have any clue, you know, just the basic stuff that we go through? I know that this is complicated, and I don't wanna sound like a know-it-all, but you two saw what I was willing to do for you today. There are many other Christians that would do the same thing because they genuinely care about you. I don't doubt that about you, I just-- (Peter) The bottom line is that I believe the Bible. Even though I'm terrified to do it, I have to speak the truth, no matter what people think of me. It's not even about me. It's about this wonderful loving God that sent His Son to die on the cross and rise from the dead so that sinners could be forgiven and have everlasting life.

I can't remember the last time I did that. Wow. Well, thank you very much. So I've been watching the videos that you showed me, like, all day today. And I haven't told anyone this yet, but I'm kinda starting to feel a little nervous because it's starting to all make sense. (Peter) Right. You know, the whole thing about heaven and hell and-- (Peter) Right. So you understand the gospel, the main message of the Bible? I think so. We're sinners and Jesus can save us? Right. Well, Jesus came to die on the cross for sinners, yeah. So when you turn away from sin and you put your faith in Him, then you're saved from the punishment you deserve.

[Diana giggling] Yeah, I said the word "sin." Anyway, I've actually been reading the Bible, and it's really making me think. But I'm not quite there yet. I definitely have some questions. So as I've been reading, I've noticed that God often gives people second chances, and I like that because, oh, I could use a second chance. So I just wanted to say thanks. I know I've been arguing with you about God and stuff, but you've been nice enough to put up with me. So, thank you for not giving up on me. You're a true friend. (female news reporter) A dramatic rescue happened just hours ago when a woman was almost crushed by an oncoming train. The rescue effort almost turned tragic when the victim refused to be rescued. I spoke with the hero's cousin earlier. (male) My cousin said that when the train was coming, he was trying to get her out of the car but she just kept screaming at him and looking at him like he was evil or something. I mean, he had to break the car window just to get her out. She didn't understand what he was trying to do. I mean, she thought he was trying to hurt her. What she didn't realize is he was actually trying to save her. So there you have it, a selfless act of courage from an apparent enemy who turned out to be a friend.
