Hello. Director wong. Hi. The couple who made it this big in just four years Keung, very well done. She hasn't said yes. I'm still courting her looking forward to working with you same here you used to be a firefighter it's the perfect job for you I used to think I'd be a firefighter for life we did training drills and wiped down the tools every day accidents don't wait we can only be prepared in the best possible ways but whenever I see... Someone died in a fire I asked myself was there more I could've done? In the past... I saved one person at a time but now... I want our fire protection systems to protect more people (Air Conditioning System Control Room) Hey guys. It's so humid. Without electricity and air conditioning We'll fix it before sunset I'm not pushing you, but... Can you get it done any sooner? Equipment in the electrical room needs constant temperature blame it on the weather... For being so abnormal it's July already but still humid and foggy do your best. Thanks. Lam si Lok, please come with me Dad was there a notice ordering the occupant on 32/f to remove the bottled water? They haven't removed it? Not yet... Looks like they've stacked more ok, I come to take a look, you continue your work got it Sir, I decide to quit since six years ago... You've got married I have expected you'd leave one day I hope you would understand Tai kwan, to be honest with you... The department has confirmed your promotion it's a pity that you decide to quit at this point but I've made up my mind day 89.3 months already how do you feel? I start having morning sickness I don't feel like eating all day that's normal. It's strange that your husband never comes with you for check up. (To Si Lok. How's it?) He must find time to stop by no matter how busy he is I'll give him a lecture on being a father ok. You take a break. I'll get some film. Dinner time let's go Your flight for hangzhou departs at 9pm tonight. You have a contract to sign I'll drive you to the airport I'll drive you to the airport tonight?

What do you mean? Opening surprise? I need you... With or without this company marry me? Why didn't you notify me before you test the alarms? Boss, I haven't started testing. Then what happened? How come the panel lights up on every floor? Is it a fire or false alarm? Just got a call from the main mechanical room The system server hangs because the extreme humidity today temperature in that room is supposed to be constant always. How can it be humid? Security office sent us a memo saying the air-conditioning room is under repair today part of the basement may not have air-conditioning we didn't expect it to be so foggy as soon as the air-conditioning is off... And walls are sweating like in spring when I was a firefighter... False alarms on a humid day were quite normal but I've never seen a whole building without air conditioning as a result boss, we're working on it. Go find out what's wrong. Of course Now what? I've called engineering department they are sending someone over air conditioning will resume in an hour I'll get someone to dehumidify the room but the fire system will be down for 5 minutes. Things will be back to normal after that I give you 3 minutes ok. Got it. I'll try my best! Boss, the short circuit problem is fixed has the signal resumed normal? Hang on Check the air conditioning room see if it's just a false alarm ok, got it leave it for now check the air conditioning room first move it... Quick Keung, what happened? There's a fire in the basement air conditioning room affecting the voltage and causing a outage but please don't worry our backup power source is on...
