We will create a home together thanks to the righteous grandmothers and saints, amen. Tuesday night In a southern town A double blessing, a wedding is about to take place Reserve soldier Sergeant Nissim Malka And Mami, the neighbor's daughter Clouds of rain and war Hover over the abandoned textile factory The young couple has hope and love The bride no profession, the groom not a dime The bride no profession, the groom not a dime. Thank you. Thank you. You're so beautiful. You're perfect. "Listen, Masters." -Cheers! "Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, "Who creates the fruit of the vine."–Amen. "Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, "Who has sanctified us with His commandments "And has commanded on forbidden unions, Who forbade betrothed women to us "And permitted women who are married to us through canopy and consecration. "Blessed are You, God, "Who sanctifies His people through canopy and consecration." Amen. Drink and give the bride a sip. I will stay on at the gas station You'll stay on for a year at the factory, then we'll make plans We're in no rush, our whole lives ahead of us And Tuesday night we will say we are doubly blessed Doubly blessed. By midnight the joy ends The guests gather the flowers and food for the next day The groom dons his uniform, returns to his regiment, the bride returns home Another day in the south gone by Another day gone by This is the address. Who is at the door? It's 2AM. Let us sleep! A military pickup in front of the house. Let the doctor go first. "No, he's not dead." "He's paralyzed." She is told. The soul, the body, the mind In 24 hours it will sink in She gets a shot The pickup leaves at three Her eyes are blank No one is in the room Perhaps when she awakes, they will say "It was a mistake" The child, the bride in her sleep runs away From the end of her childhood Mami Your soldier is a vegetable The wedding ceremony is brief Eternity is eternal Mami Your soldier is a vegetable The wedding ceremony is brief Eternity is eternal You who is called God Who has created peace in Your heaven If only You would create peace in my soul You who is called God Good morning.

I who have been A blind scarecrow in the field a frightened victim of the birds of prey I am reborn, but I am different I learned to fly We're going on air. Final touchups. Ten, Nine, Everyone out. Eight. Clear the studio. Five. -What's his name? -Nissim Malka. Good evening, we are pleased to host this first interview with Mami and her husband, Nissim Malka, the war hero, since the surprising announcement this morning. -Hello, Mami. -Hello. Up until last month, Mami was anonymous, a cashier in the south, But this morning she announced that she is running for prime minister. Mami, your breakthrough into public life was meteoric, but haven't you gone too far? -Too far? -All the analysts say that this move of yours is doomed to fail. Maybe you're biting off more than you can chew? Udi, I woke up, this nation is waking up. Let me speak to my nation. Join Mami Join Mami To the new power Join Mami To the new power The left is filth, the left is cancer that eats the oxygen from the national body. Spreads to the brain, annihilating every cell. It suckles, it squeezes. It is a parasite, it is scum. Living in an Arab house, eating humus and foul, and making a living off criticizing the "occupation" abroad. An unabashed spy for Russia and China, Minors by night, cocaine by day. Join Mami... Join Mami! The right is a Fascist, self-righteous psychopath. The morals of a robot, a fanatic killer. The vision of the right is a sealed ghetto, Pogroms all night, revenge come morning. Let's remember the right wing gods, Mussolini, Franco and Idi Amin. The law is the law, but the state is above it, so put a bullet into every suspect's head. Join Mami... The religious are lazy exilic parasites shamelessly using me and you. Blacks out, bastards and sons-of-bitches out. They are the Middle Ages, Shylock Ltd. They force their ways on us all Judging in bed, our kosher ways They want to rule us all! Join Mami The enlightened atheist is controlling and racist, Any believer, he deems small. In the name of socialism and godlessness, he enslaved the brown and the black. He writes theses and studies on the expense of the weak, and awards himself prizes for this. He is the name of a street, the image on cash, in his history he is a pioneer, all the rest, a dangerous invader. Mami! Mami! Mami! Join Mami! Join Mami! Take from the left what is good: egalitarian Jewish ethics for all. Take from the right what is good: a national fist and reliable army. Take from the enlightened what is good: free academic education for all. Take from the religious what they've got: honor thy father and mother and revere God! You ask if we should go to war, and what it means, and how many casualties we are gambling on, and what it means financially and morally, can we overcome a national trauma or crisis? And damn it, I say: Jews, what's there to think about? War is good. War is an abscess that needs to be drained. Yes, it is painful, but it must be done. A country is measured by its kilometers, not its graves. And the years following the war will be good years. Death does not scare me, death is but a corridor to a longed for divine Jewish essence. God will extend His hand to the light and take us to Him, dead or cripple, He will set us down in His heaven, take us to You! For we are tired of being people, we are all sacred lambs. Take us to You, kill us, gather us up to You forever! Take the ones you call sane Take the insane Take the old and the young Take the ugly and the beautiful Small heads and large Just take, take, take The good people, the sons of bitches too, and don't forget me Just take, take, take Just take, take, take The upper class, the lower class Those who live poorly and those who live good Take the intellectuals, men of the fist Just take, take, take Those that cry and those that shoot, and don't forget me Just take, take, take Just take, take, take Kill us, gather us What was and will be don't matter For we were dust and all these years We dreamt of returning to dust Just take, take, take Just take, take, take Take Poles and Romanians, Bulgarians and Yemenites Take the TV addicts, the junkies Take the bleeding hearts and the soulless Stinking bankers, workers of the soil, and don't forget me Just take, take, take Just take, take, take The human beings we were Take us and we'll send you more For our lives are bland and pitiful and death suits us well Take us to you Give us skulls and bones And we will wage war in Your name! From the factories From the offices From in between women's legs Leaving our children The siren Will take us all To the red fields In war is a womb We are born In fear is life We never knew Foolish men we were, fathers and husbands We have become hunters in the red fields How the years have gone by The tribe returns to the red fields How the years have gone by The tribe returns to the red fields If only I could see If only I could move If only I could talk "Give it all up "and come back home" I would tell you I would say Someone crying out in the night Someone in uniform The informers raid the city Planes going up and down It was you who cried out into the night You who was injected with the anesthetic How did you become a war dog Leading Into the red fields After all we have heard in recent days, the testimonies, the analyses, there is no escaping the determination that you are guilty of the failure of the last campaign. The question that came up time and again was: Why didn't we win? What went wrong? You promised us a decisive victory. The penalty determined by this committee: Eternal retirement from politics and public life. Do you have anything to say? All the rivers flow to the sea But, the sea is never full Our beautiful thoughts Were born in wars And end in wars Our thoughts became dreams And women, women filled them We created families Delivered children Whose end comes with wars We who became dreams Our children won't ever see us They will walk by us in uniform And we won't see them We Who were devoured by fire And our children Whose end is in fire For we are all parched rivers Remote from the sea Time won't heal The wound won't mend What you don't shout No one will say What you don't shout No one will say What you don't shout No one will say How the years went by The tribe returns To the red fields How the years went by The tribe returns To the red fields How the years went by The tribe returns To the red fields How the years went by The tribe returns To the red fields
