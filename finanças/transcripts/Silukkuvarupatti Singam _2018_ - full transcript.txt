By then we will retire, sir The only solution is... ...to finish him off in our style without anyone's knowledge Be under the impression his chapter is closed Sir? 'Not only you' But how many ever cops hound me ...you can't touch even a strand of my hair! Deputy Police Commissioner of Chennai, Mr Saravana Kumar... ...was shot dead by notorious rowdy Cycle Shankar in Tambaram 'This murder in broad daylight has been recorded' '...in the CCTV camera fixed at the signal' 'It has created a stir amongst the public' 'Commissioner Paneer Selvam has assigned a special task force to nab Cycle Shankar' It's a shame to our department He was fixing punctures in a cycle shop at the age of 10 Today he's Cycle Shankar! Dodging Chennai police like a pro 44 cases against him With his political clout he wriggled out scot-free We must finish him off in an Encounter It isn't easy to nab him But still we shouldn't give up We should kill him And show the world how efficient we are 'Started, huh?' Why are you struggling? Just throw it down It will break of its own accord Is this how you iron? Creases all over Are you catching a culprit wearing an ironed shirt? All you do is a peon's job in that police station Grandma, you seem to be going overboard from the morning? Hey, Sathi Your grandfather wished to make you a good police officer But he didn't live to see his dream come true He made me promise I'll make his dream come true and only then die I'm losing hope that day will ever dawn You keep saying this like a broken record! What do you want me to do? What else will I ask you, dear? You are a constable now Get promoted as a sub inspector before I die, that's all Does it mean you'll never die?! Arrogance pours out of every pore! Good morning, Baskar Stuffing yourself early in the morning Make 2 half boiled eggs with extra pepper Pack 20 idlis, 10 'poori' sets And 12 'dosas' Won't they buy?

Give, bro - Hello...? - Tell me You got eyes at the back of your head? Let go of him, Sathi It was a mistake How does it matter if he knew or not? Waste of an egg! That's all, right? Anyway we needn't pay Get lost! No, Baskar I'm angry because an egg went waste 'Is he mad?' Sir, parcel 'He messed up my mood early in the morning' Hey! Move out of the way Hey...! Collection should be excellent - On the job - Okay, master Hey, give me Get the cash out Cash...quick The cops are useless All they do is gawk!

Don't interfere You won't have a shop in this market You got tense for a silly egg They are so bold and brutal You're standing like a boulder I'll tell you later Hurry up, let's go - Why such poor collection today? - Put these cards - Get in - Let's go Move...move aside So wrong and ruthless! Who is this chap? Chandran, his nickname is Share auto Chandran Notorious rowdy What he says is law for the past 20 years Our department didn't take any action for 20 years? Should finish him off in an Encounter Encounter...? That's a mistake we should never do, Baskar If we touch a rowdy their sons will grow up as goons ...take a vow and take revenge on our children How can you be so scared? Don't you know karate? Who told you? All half baked Learning karate is not for bashing up thugs But not to be bashed up by them You won't understand Let's start our duty 'Weaves a story so well' Did you invite everyone? Take good care of all the bigwigs Uncle, visiting our station so early in the morning? 'Wearing his uniform and acting as errand boy' 'Calling me 'uncle' and humiliating me' Is he your uncle?

Why...? That's when Hema, a North Indian girl joined our school in 11th grade Do you know how she looked? Oh my God! Totally different level I heard Raji finished her 12th grade and took up a teacher's training course Poor thing!

Don't worry, Shankar Only 1 more month I'll create a problem and change that commissioner Show it in action, not words! Before that you must do me a favor Isn't it enough what I did all along?

In Pondicherry Leave for Nilakkottai right away 'Do this all by yourself' Shouldn't be even an iota of suspicion about the killer You finish him off I'll handle the commissioner They used to make egg 'bonda' in the morning It was out of the world Now they have stopped I always liked to eat only half boiled eggs, Baskar - Why...? - You can just swallow it, very easy 'What's with this rash driving?' Who are you? Killed someone Want to surrender? Ask constable Baskar to come out 'He wants to meet you' Why do you want to meet him? He has proposed to my sister Sneha in WhatsApp bombarding her with messages He has sent Friend request on Facebook Invited her to play Candy crush That moron didn't even know the game is outdated Like Khushboo in 'Chinna Thambi' we were protective about our sister 'Have you seen Khushboo, you dumbo?' How dare he change her heart! Ask him to come out We'll chop him right here and all 4 of us will go to jail Let me tell them He is on medical leave Back after 2 months Why medical leave all of a sudden? His mother-in-law is not well Mother-in-law? A married man has proposed to our sister We must pickle him to pieces Why do you behave like barbarians? Yes, we are savages The four of us can't even read or write But we educated our sister right up to undergrad 'Illiterates, huh?'

I forgot Let me drive then Sir, he is dangerous We must plan- Why trouble yourself? Let's wait for the driver Is that what you wanted to say? Chandran will leave by then We must catch him today You're so insistent Let me drive, sir - Get in, sir - Quick...quick We are ready, sir 'If I drive slowly, I won't be pounded by Chandran' 'What is his hidden agenda?' Why are you driving at a bullock cart's pace? - Speed up - Maximum speed is 40 km, sir At this speed, they will go home and sleep But we should not break the rules, sir This won't work Hold the steering wheel I'll press the accelerator Sir...sir About turn! Move aside - Police, master! - Press the brake now Aiyaiyo! Make mincemeat out of them now! Kill him Hey, why did you come in between? You deserve to be- Bingo! 'Finish it fast' You dare hit us knowing we are Chandran's men? Get into the auto Hey! Who will pay for the broken glass? He sailed mid-air and broke it Let me check his pocket Looks like he's asking me to flick his wallet! Before he gets up start the auto - Let's go - Lift...higher Where are they? Shucks! Just escaped Hey Baskar What happened to Sathi? Lift him Coast is clear now You can get up Where are they? I won't spare them Don't yell, Sathi Don't worry, one day or the other I'll slice him into two right here Sathi, why did you have to fly in mid-air and break their glass? Sorry, sir I don't know what I do when I'm really angry - Aiyaiyo! You're bleeding - It's alright, sir - Baskar - I know He needs a Tetanus Toxoid injection Good, you are sharp - 'For no reason you harp' - Go right now You'll be caught whether Chandran gets caught or not Me...? What happened? 'Why is he running?' Raji should be clean bowled by my performance today Hold this - Why didn't you fix the IV? - You don't need all this, sir What happened? A riot in the market it seems Tell me, what happened? Share auto Chandran's gang accosted us - With Chandran? - Raji Are you here? Couldn't you have been careful while fighting those thugs? All this is routine in a cop's life, dear When I jumped from the jeep, to catch the auto... I didn't notice the windshield right in front of me Shards of glass pierced my hand You are always like this Is it a deep wound, sister? Why did she walk out without replying? She is silent because he has to be under observation for 48 hours You are working so hard But do you know my dad derides you? What does he say? Does he say I just pretend to fight and I'm a scaredy-cat? Ask him to prove it Why do you get flustered for no reason? - He didn't say that at all - He didn't, huh? What else did he say, dear? You are more of an errand boy instead of a proper policeman From now on, I won't run errands for anyone in the station, okay? 'He's giving up on the only job he did properly!' You don't worry, Sathi One day or the other... ...you will arrest a rowdy far more dangerous than Chandran Drag him on the roads in front of everyone I'll be there to enjoy that scene I will die before that! Sure da, my darling "Play at night and sleep in the day" "This is the way of the world anyway" [song from 'Navarathiri'] Hey, come here - Yes, sir - Clean this up Your order, sir? Quarter rum, water and 'tandoori' chicken - What is our peg count so far? - 16 pegs Are we on a high? I meant are we sozzled? - Not at all - It is all spurious stuff We've been conned Click a photo and upload in Facebook I'll tell my FB friends to share if they are true Tamilians - Watch this - Super idea, bro 'Likes' will erupt like a volcano Hey boy, get another full bottle It's late, we will be closing down Late, huh? Call your owner That group is really troublesome Please talk to them, bro What is the matter? Do you drink just to create a ruckus? It is beyond 10:00 p.m Leave now, come on - All of you leave now - Hey! Sit down You don't have to go Just sit down Sit...sit...sit down You open the shop late in the morning And close the shop early at night If you maintain such short hours how can India become a Super Power? Travel and widen your mind Shops abroad are open 24 hours Try to reform at least now Are you tanked and being troublesome? I am not drunk and that's the whole trouble When has your booze ever intoxicated us? We entered when the sun set And we've been drinking All we do is pee but no sign of getting high To top it all I go home and my wife picks a quarrel when I'm not even high! We will leave only if we get tanked None of you step out till then Drink till dawn It's my treat - Off you go - Call the bartender boy He has taken his 'weapon' out! I'm a globetrotter drunkard! - Don't underestimate us - Hello, police station? Master, 2 half boiled eggs with extra pepper Who is creating trouble in the bar? Sir, I was about to meet you They are selling booze higher than the market price, sir Sometimes it's tough to open the lid One tap at the bottom and one on top It spins like a roulette In spite of all this trouble we don't get high Drink and test it as a true officer Here you go Only 1 peg Doesn't it stink? - 'Now you know our difficulty?' - Leaving half way through, bro? I came here to drink in peace Such a ruckus here as well No 'please' of mind...! I would rather go back to the serenity of my grove Fine, but watch your step 'Bear in mind I'll beat you to a pulp' I have every right to ask you as a citizen, file the case 'I will book you under the Goondas Act' You think I'm a goon to be booked! Master, I'm sure the egg is cooked Quoting rules to me?! Pick up everyone immediately You'll arrest me? Try your luck 'You are underestimating my power' You have no clue of my followers in Facebook 'If I set my mind, I can get you transferred tomorrow' - 'Sparing you because you're a cop' - Sir, your bill 'Our main purpose in life is to booze' 'We've spent millions in booze' Rs 845, sir Try hitting me You'll have a riot! Why are you looking on? Let go of me, I say Hey! You there Stop, I say Just you wait! Bad enough you ruined my half boiled egg You dare walk away without an apology! You're dead meat, man iPhone! Finders keepers! - Good morning, miss - Good morning - Heard you rocked last night at the bar - As usual, right? How can I turn a blind eye to a crime in front of me, huh? If you're obsessed with duty what about a wife in your life? And start a family of your own in due course? What's the tearing hurry? We just started dating - We can wait a bit - No rush for you My parents don't feel that way My father asked the marriage broker to look for a groom He's finding a groom for you? Will anyone go past me and become your fiancé? If anyone dares- You know I'll close his chapter in an Encounter and move on? I'll be late for school See you 'Police station?' My dear chap Where are you from? I've never seen you earlier in this jail 'Thank god, nobody recognizes me' 'What is he so deep in thought about?' '- Baskar - Sir' 'Any update on brothel case in Kothanampatti?' 'I interrogated everyone' We can't proceed further due to lack of eye witnesses - Why do you need an eye witness for this? - SI sir Why am I locked up? Weren't you part of the ruckus in the bar last night? - If I'm there will you arrest me? - Then what? I'm in no way connected to them Under what section are you detaining me here? Release me immediately or I'll call my lawyer Hey Sathi, he's threatening me Why do you lock up such fellows? Sir, he ruined my half boiled egg and jinxed my evening He doesn't know any law or a lawyer Just pulling a fast one Staring dagger at me, eh? Call your lawyer If you see a costly phone you'll pocket it, huh? - Give my iPhone - iPhone? What the hell do you mean? Which iPhone? The blows you got last night weren't enough, huh?

Go and buy my tiffin Let go of my hand Let go - Sir, usual 'poori'? - Buy 'pongal' as well Go along with him to help him carry it Sir, who is this fellow? Constable Sathiyamoorthy - Why do you need to know? - Move aside, bro Why are you sending a cop to buy us food? If you let us out, we can eat and happily go back home - What are you blabbing? - This is a petty case Is this your mother-in-law's house? You have a pile of cases heaped on you, I'll kill you 'This has become a routine' There they are! Yaaay! My wife is here 'My wife' Keep quiet! Look here, your husbands created a ruckus in the bar last night I've filed a 'public nuisance' case - I won't release them - Who asked you to, sir?

As if we become mothers when you are out and free Men work so hard and so they tend to sleep, out of sheer exhaustion So what? Don't let your tongue run! Can you detain them for 1 year or not? This isn't such a serious offence at all File a rape case, sir He gets tanked and rapes me every night, sir Savithri! Don't wash dirty linen in public It's absolutely personal Your husband is better than mine My husband knocked at Sarasu's door, fully sozzled - You went to Sarasu's house? - Is that so?

Shankar, have you reached Nilakkottai? I heard Narayanan is planning a meeting in the Party office this evening? Why is he hanging up in mid conversation? Hey! Minister is calling Pull aside - Yes, sir - 'Where is Shankar'? Why isn't he picking my call? He isn't picking our calls either, sir We are also trying to find him I gave Shankar an assignment I need to discuss with him What assignment, sir? Why are you so curious? Tell me, sir I won't breathe a word I told him to kill Narayanan of Nilakkottai 'I need to talk to him regarding this' Is this such a big secret, sir? I intended to finish him off myself 'Don't worry, sir We'll handle this' Hey, bro has gone to Nilakkottai Take an U turn and let's go there 'Every minute I am here adds to my tension' 'Before I am identified, I must escape from here' - Who went on night patrol? - Sathi and I, sir - Gandhi Park? - Sathi, sir - Nehru Park? - I went, sir Who is that beggar in front of our station? - Sir, it's me - You, huh? - What is it? - Please release me, sir I'll pay you whatever you ask, sir - Will you give Rs 10000? - I can add a couple of zeroes!

'Hey, Sathi' 'We are notorious rowdies and we are sitting quiet' 'Why do you want to buy trouble?' 'Dasara' festival is round the corner My wife wants our house cleaned Why don't you send our boys? These chaps are sitting here idle They are prisoners Don't mess with them What did the cops do in 'Visaranai'? The prisoners were made to wash the loo Doesn't the same rule hold good here? Yes...correct Amudha, I'm sending some boys to spruce up our place 'Go and dismantle the furniture' They got us into this mess like the Bigg Boss reality sho [excerpts from 'Friends'] 'If you touch the furniture you'll be the 1st dead body' - Yov - What? If you co-operate a bit we can both escape from here You are an out-of-towner You can happily escape I am a local resident They will hunt me down and pound me to a paste! You and your brainwave! Come with me I'll take good care of you Am I your lover or what? You're way off target I'm NOT what you make me out to be Will you listen to me?

'12 task forces have been assigned to nab Cycle Shankar' 'We will nab him very soon' Sakthi, commissioner claims he has 12 task forces to nab 1 chap - Is he that notorious a rowdy? - 100% 'So many cases against him' But the cops can't trace him Let him be the most dangerous criminal Why can't they close his chapter with an Encounter? Why send out armies to catch hold of him? If only I find him I'll squeeze his breath out! Then what, bro? They have handcuffed 2 innocent people And let a criminal go scot-free? Isn't that a crime?! Wonder what crap this sub inspector eats! Yov! Let me repeat this Come with me I'll take care of you Do you want mutton 'biriyani' or not? Shut up and scrub We'll sit here and eat and then attend to our work Who is this calling me at such an unearthly hour? Hello...hey! Do you think I don't know where you are and what you're up to?

'Silukkuvaarpatti Limit Begins' Hey! This is our bro's car Stop...stop, I say That's it, he sees a bar he will park his car Doctor warned him of kidney failure Does he listen? Our nation comes up with so many new inventions No one has invented a wireless mobile without a charger It is so tiresome Bro's car is parked out but he isn't in here Let's go and check his car Cheeeers! 'Is he sleeping inside?' Are you checking to see if anyone is inside? Past days this car has been parked here His phone isn't reachable He looks like an Anglo-Indian Let's go and ask him - Talk to him in English - Yeah! - Excuse me, gentleman - Yes, what do you want? If you don't mind have you seen this person? - Watch the photo - J7? Am I giving the phone to you for servicing? See if you can identify this person? I will try His hair style, beard and moustache All this remind me of actor-director T.Rajendran If he's hairy he's T.Rajendran Then is a baldie 'Mottai' Rajendran? Tortoise skull! Stupid of me to ask you - Come, boys - Excuse me, sir - Oh! Thank you - No mention He and his butler English! Hey! El Groucho 3 days ago this man came here to have a drink, did you see him? Think and tell me He wouldn't have tipped you This man? Oh! Yes Yes, he came here and ordered a drink Even when the cops came in he ordered from this table The cops came here? Yes, there was such a ruckus that night The cops arrested 5-6 people - Bro, come here - Coming What is this new twist? What if our bro was arrested? News would've leaked out Sometimes they will interrogate under their custody secretly They won't let go till our bro confesses Instead of wasting time talking like this... ...let's go to the police station Why take that risk? Let's drink and head back to Madras We have to find our bro Why are you so concerned? He's my cousin! You never told us Kith and kin shouldn't be revealed to accomplices! That's rowdy's policy Gawd!

What else will I ask? Ganesan case has been dragging for too long Yov! That can't be closed that easily Sir, if you set your mind you can close it When I become a MLA won't I line your pocket? Do the needful, sir Do you think becoming an MLA is that easy? It is tough, I agree I'm going to Chennai to meet the minister - Devaraj? - They have made him a dummy I meant ArumugaPerumal He hails from my hometown He is a weird character How can you trust him? Sir...sir I'll talk to the minister and get him a MLA seat As him to release me, sir Get me also the Inspector general post! Senseless fellow! - Who is he, sir? - He is off his rockers - Blabbermouth - Yov! Who is off his rockers? Am I a lunatic? I'll bash you up How dare you retort from in there? I'll kill you How dare you back answer? Sir, please do the needful I'm on my way Sit down I'll go in under the pretext of filing a complaint and check if bro is inside Don't go off to eat, huh? 'This area isn't in our jurisdiction Why should we provide security?' 'Maybe they think we are watchmen, sir?' What are we doing otherwise anyway! Good morning, sir What do you want? - My wallet is missing - Get a new one I've come to complain about the purse-thief, sir 'Bro is here' - Want to go in? - Plenty of time for that!

Let it get dark Then we'll bring him out "How could you do this, my dear?" I'll gladly oblige, dear! Lazy bones! Buffaloes Let's go Our station has a reputation to uphold Who are you? Only if a cop hits it's 1.5 tonne weight, uh? Even rowdies can boast of the same 1.5 ton Who the hell are all of you? What gall to lock up our bro Cycle Shankar? Cycle Shankar, huh? Then what? Hero Jai Shankar? Why are your eyes swollen? Did they hit you, bro? Tell us, we can burn the entire lot alive Where is he? Ask my boss, the sub inspector Sir...sir...sir Where is he? Tell me right now I don't know, sir I swear I don't know Bro, either shoot him or let him go Let's go, minister has been calling us nonstop Where do you want me to go? Our assignment in Nilakkottai? Dump your assignment in the Bay of Bengal! Why did he shoot the light? I need to find someone here - Who? - Sathiyamoorthy Constable Sathiyamoorthy who put me behind bar I won't leave this place till I close his chapter Come Do I look like a petty thief? [humming] What happened, sir? Why are you standing like you've seen a ghost? Did Share auto Chandran come here? Especially when I wasn't here 'Shoves his feet into his mouth!' I am asking you, sir It wasn't Share auto Chandran Cycle Shankar That Chennai rowdy? - Yes - Why did he come here? Good question - You arrested him here - Have you lost your mind? You locked up a chap and tortured him when bored He is none other than Cycle Shankar - I don't believe this - Yes, sir His thugs came and wrecked the place and took him along You know what his exit line was? Killing you is on top of his list 'Bad enough you ruined my half boiled egg' You raised hell on earth for a simple half boiled egg! Now he intends making a 'half boil' out of you!! 'What do you mean iPhone?' 'Do you think you are a mafia don or what?' 'I will gouge your squid-eyes Don't you glare at me' 'Jostled my half boiled egg!' 'I need to find someone here by name Sathiyamoorthy' 'Constable Sathiyamoorthy who put me behind bar' 'I won't leave this place till I close his chapter' Sir, I'm sub inspector Muththaiya from Silukkuvaarpatti police station Very important! You call yourself a policeman? Can't you recognise Cycle Shankar? Such a notorious rowdy He seemed familiar but I blanked out, sir Extremely sorry, sir If you arrest someone won't you enquire about him? How did you keep him in for 4 days? It was wrong on my part, sir - Namaste sir - Who are they? They created a ruckus in the bar, sir - Yes, sir - Useless fellows - Send them out - Constable, release me Wait, why trouble yourself? Hold this, they have broken everything Sir, you look like a superior officer A small request All the shops in this joint sell duplicate liquor My insides have burnt out They don't want to take any action You know very well why they choose not to - Get lost! - Thank you so much Sir takes foreign liquor Why will he bother? - 'Tell me, sir' - What is happening there? - Can't trace Cycle Shankar - Local police is under your control Cycle Shankar should have no issues Commissioner is here I'll talk to you later Good morning, sir Name the constable who arrested Cycle Shankar? - He is Sathiyamoorthy - Where is he? Don't know where he is Feeling dizzy, he went out for a cup of tea last night That's the last we saw or heard of him - His phone is switched off - I would like to say this Shankar left the station swearing his 1st duty is to kill Sathiyamoorthy I think that's why he is hiding Is it? Jack in the box! He isn't the kind to run and hide, sir He will hunt and kill In fact he was the one who arrested Cycle Shankar and treated him harshly - Then where is he? - That's a mystery, sir Already that Cycle Shankar has killed a policeman Now he has taken an oath to kill another cop Whether we find Cycle Shankar or not... ...1st we must find Sathiyamoorthy Sir, a constable has arrested a rowdy which you as a commissioner couldn't do What is your opinion? There is no difference between constable and commissioner, all are cops I am proud that a Tamil Nadu Police constable arrested rowdy Cycle Shankar Is there a motive behind Cycle Shankar moving to this city? Don't know, we've just started our investigation 'Bro, the constable has an old love' - Shall we kidnap her? - And do what? - Do something - My slipper will speak! Aiyaiyo! Mr Specs is calling Bro, he has called 4 times It will go against us if you don't talk What has happened now for you to get so upset? He is an ordinary constable How can you think of him as your rival? You kill Narayanan and come here Narayanan is not my 1st priority Constable Sathiyamoorthy Only I know the disgrace I've been facing for the past 4 days Do you know how much he insulted me? My mind will be appeased only after I find him and pickle him to pieces When I hunt and kill that constable Sathiyamoorthy ...the very next day Narayanan will be dead Whom are you calling now? Calling my iPhone I left it in the bar - It's ringing - For sure it will ring It's Tony again - He picked up - You bet he will Your hello will be one sided He won't reply Let me handle him - Hello sir, how are you? - Hello sir, who are you? Sir, you are holding my bro's mobile You sound like a well read person Oh yes! I was just reading the newspaper! Your phone is stuck with a lunatic Sir, had it been someone else, he would've changed the number by now But you are a gentleman Because you want to return the phone to its owner! If you want you can buy another mobile Finders keepers! I am the owner of this mobile Don't say that You haven't changed the Sim What will you do with it? I will play games That's an iPhone, sir Sir, if want money let us know, we can pay - How much will you give? - How much, huh? Quote any amount Let's come to a neat arrangement Let's settle for Rs 1500 Whom are you trying to cheat? How can an iPhone cost just Rs 1,500? I thought he is mad but he's really sharp Okay, sir 'We'll pay whatever you're expecting' Give it to me - Add 50 more - I'll pay you Rs 50,000 - 50,000, huh? - Okay, double that I could have flicked his phone myself Even 50,000 is high He's doubling it Whacko! 'Okay, come immediately to Nehru park' Only after I count the money... ...I'll hand over this mobile to you - Deal - Okay - What? - He agreed What did he agree? You are paying double the cost of this phone Moron, I've stored all the evidence in that phone Just to be on the safe side ...I've recorded the audio and video of all the conversations of our minister If he gets caught he can't come out this birth That's been my wish too It won't come true Let's go Forget it then Is he Tony? Looks like a big cauldron to make 'biriyani' He's calling us Hello, sir, how are you? I am waiting for you Why have you brought these rowdies just to take the phone, sir? You are mistaken, sir, these are students of Engineering college Which college admits students with a mop of hair and pot bellies? 'From where is this creature watching us?' 'If I get hold of him-' Sir, we have your cash with us Give us the mobile and take the money But where is the suitcase? Dumbass, why do we need a suitcase for 1 lakh? You can fold 50 notes of Rs 2000 denomination in your pocket Who are you trying to fool? This phone now belongs to me - Don't hang up - See you? 'I thought he was mad' I am starting for Chennai at 5:00 a.m Update me on any news of Cycle Shankar Any information on constable Sathiyamoorthy? Not yet, sir We are enquiring Sathiyamoorthy will have a reason for every action of his, sir How did you become a sub-inspector? Okay, you can go now Good night, sir Hey...! Who is it? Come out Hands up! Sir...sir Sir, don't shoot Don't act smart I will shoot you I won't, sir I don't know either Who are you? Me, sir, Sathi Constable Sathiyamoorthy - Look at me properly, sir - Constable Sathiyamoorthy? What is this disguise? Cycle Shankar has sworn to kill me Please arrest him and save my life, sir Sub inspector praised you sky high and put you on a pedestal Aiyo! He's innocent and gullible He'll fall for any story I am just a constable What can I do, sir? You think you are just a constable and you're wondering what you can do? When terrorists surrounded our Parliament and attacked Kamlesh Kumari Yadav, a constable sacrificed her life to prevent it If she had thought like you, would she have stopped the attack? Or protected the dignity of India? You are just like her You don't know your own strength We can't catch that rowdy even if we have special squads? But you arrested him with ease Because you did not see him as Cycle Shankar! You treated him as an ordinary chap! Think likewise even now I am handing this project over to you I'll give you the required police back up The project will be called Operation Cycle Somehow you arrest him In the same station where you work... ...I'll promote you as SI, okay? Post of sub inspector? Who wants this silly SI post? I am already regretting becoming a constable He thinks he's doing me a favor! Are you trying to brainwash me and link me up with that terror? All those working under you couldn't nab him You expect me to catch him? What do you take me for? For your information I caught him once already Now it's your turn, okay? Till then I am on leave Medical leave See you, sir I'll suspend you for 6 months if you take off now Aiyo! Be my guest Go ahead, sir You can even dismiss me - Did I ask you any favor? - Hey...stop Hey constable, catch him He's blabbering like an idiot! Stop, Sathiyamoorthy "He's a lion cub from Silukkuvaarpatti" "Bold, brave and daring supposedly" On the street, bro Catch him somehow and bring him here Are you sleeping? Why is Singh hovering around? Convey my regards to Modi! "Even if you search high and low No one can match our hero" - Where is he? - Ladies and gentlemen - Do you have GST issues? - Yes, sir - You handle it - Get in Wait, we'll land here someday Don't shout, grandma I'm Sathi I'm starving How can you be scared of a chap who worked in a cycle shop? I know when to catch him Serve me gravy Wherever you are in this world come what may I'll find yo- I am totally broke This is anyway bribes you got "Will he drink Superman soup sip by sip to the last drop?" "Look around, point out to me the great great-grandson of Baahubali?" Sleeps like a buffalo! 'I'm a super Indian cop used to hip hop' 'I don't play with words Just play with swords' Thief! Thief!! - I'm not a thief - Someone wake up...help! Who is that? 'Wearing khaki swaying with a thuppakki' 'Please don't get confused I'm not 'Thala' or 'Thalapathi' 'Stop it, I'm feeling all shy, baby' 'People say I'm a mixture of these 2 you see' 'Chilling, cooling like I'm a king in this city' 'I'm just very cute These girls call me cutie' 'But my momma says I'm a little bit o' a Tamil beauty' 'Tho' I'm a strict cop I'm a little naughty' 'I don't talk to thugs My gun does the talking' 'If you mess with me you would be like broken' 'Tho' I'm a gangster, man, just joking' 'Take a chill pill There's no reason to be chokin' Rain is so scarce now Come, dear She is just back from school What's happening here, ma? Look, what your father is up to? He didn't want you to marry into my side of the family How fair is it, he's fixing a groom from his side! Is this a competition? Did I ask to get married? - He's coming - What is it, dear? What are mother and daughter conspiring? I am not interested in this alliance, pa Let's say no to this groom Will you marry Sathi your mother's nephew? I thought you would've forgotten him by now But you haven't That rowdy had sworn to kill him one of these days I can't see my daughter end up as a widow! Raji, I always have what's best for you at heart Go...get ready quickly Why are you upset? Are you getting married? It's just an engagement We can deal with it Go and change Bride is decked up All of us like the girl We are very happy If you can fix a wedding date- Priest, fix an auspicious day 20th of this month is a good day Are you okay with this, sir? Double okay, uncle With the blessings of your family deity let the auspicious event be fixed Hi Heard you got engaged But you're back to work 'Come to the van parked outside the compound' Hold this I'll be back Hey...who are you? Why did your father get you engaged? Wedding is fixed for the 20th! - What is the hurry? - Forget that Do you realise what you are doing? My father says, you are on the run, scared of Cycle Shankar Is it true? Tell me, Sathi That isn't the issue - Answer me - Same goes to you! Are you scared of Cycle Shankar? No...who said? Then come right now Join duty I know when to join duty Not now, the time isn't right Don't blabber, Sathi Everybody is maligning you Are you joining duty now or not? - Can't come - Why? I am asking you, tell me why? Aiyo! I am asking you So tell me your reason Because I am an undercover agent! Whaaat? Undercover? Undercover! Aiyo! She's torturing me I am in disguise like this only to nab Cycle Shankar This is commissioner's order He told me not to reveal this to anyone He specifically told me not to tell even you But you forced the words out of my mouth! What do you mean, Sathi? You don't trust me, right? This mission is called Operation Cycle My target is that Cycle Shankar! Really? Sorry, Sathi, even I misunderstood you 'She bought it!' Only you, huh? This whole town has misjudged me But I had an inkling of a doubt You won't hide without a reason That's my Sathi! - Come - But listen to this You must arrest Cycle Shankar before the 20th And make both my father and Rajapandi eat their words! You tie the sacred wedding thread around my neck on that very day Will you arrest him by then? Yes, I'm sure I can 'Only God can save me' 'Cycle Shankar is a notorious rowdy' 'Even the Commissioner couldn't nab him' 'But constable Sathiyamoorthy the lion cub of our town' '...locked him up with ease and gave him a few hard knocks' 'But what to do? Shankar escaped when Sathi was away' 'The police force who also gave up hope' ...is seeking Sathi's help to nab him' 'Superman of Silikkuvaarpatti' 'Brave warrior, undercover cop of Silikkuvaarpatti' 'Cop undercover to nab Cycle Shankar' Aiyaiyo! My phone I knew he'll throw it That's why I didn't give my phone Commissioner was really mean Giving him an assignment without our knowledge... ...he wants us to look for Sathi Did I ask you to tell the whole town about my assignment? - 'Madcap!' - No, Sathi I told only Sowmya You might as well have read it out on TV - Sorry, Sathi - Idiot I thought as much when constable Sathiyamoorthy was hiding from us Something was fishy Your deduction is right He isn't an ordinary cop When he could bash you up... ...he must be a holy terror of a cop! Then why is he scared of our bro? Commissioner's handiwork! He is letting the public think the constable is scared of bro Then the commissioner plans to lock up bro, kill him and give him a grand funeral! - What? - Whether he plans or not... ...you are beating him hollow! Just a wild guess Hey! Let me see who will plan to finish off whom 'You manhandled me I'll poison your food' 'Nowadays even seers have taken to liquor in public' Times are changing! They really thought you were a seer But frankly this disguise doesn't suit you one bit Have I worn this to receive an award? That Cycle Shankar- I don't want to be caught by Cycle Shankar, that's all - Sit down - Bossss! Why did you forget us? Only if you come often you can show off Baskar, Share auto Chandran Come regularly, bro To see you next I might have to visit the cemetery Sit...sit - Sit down please - Hey get up! 'Seated in a bar, instead of class room Master please sit' Baskar, give your phone Calling whom, Sathi? - Hello - Hey, give the phone to Cycle - Who is it? - Some classmate of yours He called you 'cycle' Here, shoot - Cycle? - Hey I don't know why you came to this town 'I don't even need to know' But listen to this Silikkuvaarpatti is my town 'I draw the rules here' I can't allow random tramps to rule the roost here I should not see you here tomorrow morning - Pack up and leave before dawn - Who are you? Chandran, da Share auto Chandran If you're a legitimate son tell me where you are I am in Jil Jil bar on the main road If you're born to 4 fathers you land up here I am coming right now Start the vehicle You imitated Chandran and entangled him with Cycle No, it is the other way I've linked Cycle to Share auto! Cycle Shankar may be a big rowdy in Chennai But in Silukkuvaarpatti Chandran holds the title undisputed Just wait and watch how he makes Cycle Shankar run for cover Even if you hang on to dear life in my auto ...sitting with me for a drink as equals ...this is a prize example of socialism!

Some joker blabbered for his livelihood Still it doesn't augur well Let's postpone the wedding by 6 months Don't be a pain! A priest has matched horoscopes, fixed date and you'll go by some roadside madcap? I don't care who says what Raji's wedding is on 20th 'When has he listened to me?' - 'Raji' - What? Buffalo skinned fellow! Not bad, you recognized me! As if you are hero Kamal Hassan and I can't see through your make up! Alarmed now our father would have postponed the wedding?

"This glam-doll came a-smiling appealing" "Her intentions ever so revealing" "Her graceful curves set pulses a-racing" [from 'Vasool Raja MBBS'] Who are you? Why did you barge in? Kanaka, it's me...Sathi Hey, police! What is this disguise?

He is a dangerous fellow Send him out I must kill him Murder can wait till the show is over, clear out Till then, shall I wait here? - Kanaka - Who is this? Kanaka, why aren't you picking my calls? Shut up! Kanaka has shut you up, get out Nosey parker! That's it Chapter closed They will kill me today for sure You are supposed to be a cop How can you cry? Who told you a policeman should not cry? Is there any such rule? - I can cry my heart out - Comeback only here Wait, I have an idea I can't agree to all this! - I'm in love with Raji - Idiot! You can love anyone Just shut up for now "I'm the dude from Madura city Jupiter in my horoscope is exalted, sweetie" This is nothing, wait till Kanaka comes Whole auditorium will be on fire Isn't the dance super? Sir...! Cycle Shankar! That's right I think he is in search of Sathiyamoorthy If only we can catch him now we'll get instant promotion At least let's wrap up 1 case before we retire! - Hello - I'm Sub Inspector Muththaiya speaking At this time of night? Cycle Shankar has landed here with his thugs If you come here with full force we can squash him like a rooster! Moron! What is your assignment and who are you after? Sathiyamoorthy is more important to us than Cycle Shankar - Nab him - Thank you, sir What did he say? He asked us to zip our lips and enjoy the dance Hey, ask Kanaka to come to the stage Here she comes Can fold her hip onto my lap! Kanakaa! Looks like a hard core fan "In the twilight offering time desires rise to gratify sublime" "Tempting feast on the plate Pleasured pain to satiate" Who is the other one? - More beautiful than Kanaka? - Don't know, sir A cool glam doll and tall too - Aiyo! Cycle Shankar - Who? Cycle Shankar! Why the hell did he come here? I think he is after us Let's get out, hurry up "On the banks of the river Yamuna Your garden is paradise, o' Kanna" Come on, bro "Scent of the flowers wafting in the breeze It's a mounting fever teasing to appease" [song from ' Oomai Vizhigal'] Bro, what happened? I thought it was him! You are paranoid about him! Cover your face and dance, dear Ruining a good performance? Just missed...! How could all of you let him escape? - Why exclude yourself? - Whaaat? Why are you tense? What else do you expect then? - After all a constable - Where can he go, bro? He'll be around We can nab him What now? - That dancer - Rosy glam doll! - Ask our bro - He won't agree What is it? Did you see who is walking over there? That dancer! What about her? Er...it's been a long time Boys are starved! - Whaaaat? - Just a request from them You can relax too You are missing your target all because of this tension Just indulge once and your mind will be refreshed What do you say, huh? Looks like you are on our wavelength now Shall I call her? Hey, girl...hey! Hey, you! Call loudly She may go away He seems even more randy than us! - Hey listen...you - 'Whom are they calling?' - Hey...you - Not again! Hey...stop Hey yellow skirt! Turn back Get lost, bloody scumbags!

Hey...the same glam doll is cycling furiously in front of us Lucky cycle, man Take her, we can have fun for a week [loud honking] - Who is flashing that light? - Cycle Shankar is following us Aiyo...he seems to be hounding me - Swerve to the left - It's steep, bro - Then turn right - Ditch there It's okay Just obey "Silikkuvaarpatti singam" "Supposedly bold, brave and fearsome" Even in the middle of the night ...she took that plunge to protect her chastity! She is truly a virtuous woman! God bless you Alleluia! What do you think of yourself? Do you remember tomorrow is my wedding, eh? Why don't you ask the Commissioner to relieve you from 'Operation Cycle'? - Let's focus on our life - I'll nab him for sure, Raji When? After my marriage? What is the use of catching him then? If operation is abandoned midway patient will die, bear that in mind Similarly, if I get relieved from 'Operation Cycle', Shankar will escape So only when Cycle Shankar gets locked up I can come out heaving a sigh of relief! Okay, you keep saying you'll nab him What is your plan? At least tell me that Wait till tomorrow All is well that ends well! I don't know what you will do or how But stop this marriage, that will do 'Rajapandi weds Rajeswari' Rajapandi and Rajeswari Our banners should cover our entire town In every nook and corner Even after 10 years, people should remember this wedding Understood? I'll go to the loo and be back, wait here - Buy them food - Okay, bro Hey, what are you doing here? Listen, Rajapandi Raji and I are childhood sweethearts You're just in love Please go ahead But only till my wedding day After that she's mine - Understood? - I am serious! Even I am serious, partner If I have to climb up the ladder in my political career, I need such a bride So forget Raji I can even look for a suitable bride and get you married One last request Stop the wedding yourself Or else I may have to do that You'll stop my wedding? With my party men and police around will you dare do so? What temerity! Stop this wedding if you are a real man! Wait and watch Get lost! Sir, he had the gall to challenge me I am banking on you Don't worry I'll take care of everything You keep saying this! - My boss on line - Go ahead, talk - Where are you? - I am at the wedding hall Sathiyamoorthy will come here to stop this wedding for sure I'll grab him the moment I set eyes on him Trust me, I'll bring him over to you Sir, mine is a family of inspectors My grandfather caught the rowdy 'Chappai' Siva He was a notorious chap - I swear I'll catch him - Police brother! - Is the function over? - Not yet, go inside, sir - Thank you - Sir, watch my move this time Sneha's brothers, standing together!

[Holy chant] - Hello - Hey, this is Sathi 'Hey, playing tricks with me?' 'If only I catch you-' Listen, this is an issue between you and me Either you should die or I should 'If you're really gutsy combat me face to face' Not stab me from behind like an idiot - Who is an idiot? - Pass that onion What?

Our Sathi spoke He wants to meet me immediately - You leave then - What's wrong with you? It might be a ruse so he can kidnap the bride We have to think of that, right? Has Sathi every lied to you?

You know some chap hit me on my head Get up He'll kill us with his non stop chatter! Hero dear, take him! How did you arrest Cycle Shankar singlehanded? Chennai commissioner gave me an assignment 'Operation Cycle' I just did my duty, that's all Don't be humble Listen, my dear reporters 'This iPhone has all the details of who hired him' And the nameless faces behind this No one can escape our law '25 years ago' 'There was a savage murderer by name Veerabadran' A good policeman by name Captain Prabhakaran ...dragged him down the road just like this After that incident, only this Sathiyamoorthy has achieved the impossible! 'Let me go back to my duty please' 'Where are you?' I've almost got Sathiyamoorthy I'll arrest him and bring him before you in 24 hours You are suspended for 6 months 'Cycle Shankar's iPhone provided fool proof evidence to...' '...arrest Minister Arumuga Perumal who is now detained in Vellore jail' 'Constable Sathiyamoorthy who arrested Cycle Shankar singlehanded' '...has been promoted as sub inspector in the same police station' Beat the drums [wedding hymn] Your phone is ringing Which idiot is calling me? This fellow, huh? Isn't there a time for everything? I have a job to do, right? 'Be busy with whatever But Cycle Shankar has escaped' 'Be careful' Whaaat...hello? Escaped, huh? What happened, Sathi? That Cycle Shankar has escaped from jail So you'll be going undercover once more Undercover, huh? Er...not like before 'My underwear will be torn to tatters!' Raji, how do I make you under-? I know, Sathi The day you nab him ...only then ...our 1st wedding night together Isn't that what you wanted to say? - No, not at all - I am waiting! "Lion cub of Silukkuvaarpatti" We ruled the roost in Silukkuvaarpatti Scared of Cycle Shankar we fled to Chinnalapatti Happy now? We looked up to you as a big rowdy Who are you in reality? Rowdy or dummy piece? Tell us, master The moment you boys are doubting my ability... ...it's time for me to blurt out the truth What truth, master? My name is not Chandran I have another name Indran I didn't have an auto It was an omni-van I had a motorcade flanking me The market will shake like earthquake! Then what happened to you? The sole reason Just 1 auto driver! What did an ordinary auto driver do to you? He is no ordinary auto driver He ruled as don in Bombay "Baashha...the most revered don" "Baashaa...served his people dusk to dawn" Blissfully unaware I tied him to a post and thrashed him mercilessly Even that is pardonable On top of it I touched his sister I meant I touched her hand! - Then? - Rest is his-story! I thought I was dead When a small ounce of life still remained in me 'If I ever set eyes on you again' '...I'll bury you alive in that very same spot' How can I be in that city after this threat to my life? I took off on the ride of my life I learnt only 1 lesson after that incident Don't underestimate anyone I derided you not knowing your true colors, master Many fall into your category - Get up - Cycle Shankar is a punctured tyre Ignore him But we shouldn't spare that auto driver who reduced you to this state He must be old by now Tell us who he is We'll finish him off Least we can do for you Just say yes - You? - Yes, master - Kill him? - Yes - Come close - Why, master? Not only then Even now he's the most feared don in Bombay! subtitled by rekhs assisted by harini, krish & kirthi
