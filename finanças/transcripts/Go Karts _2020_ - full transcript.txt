I'm gonna take a look at the new shop. How about you ride down, and I'll see you there? No worries, Mum. [revving engine echoing] [gasps] [upbeat music playing] [chuckles] [ship horn blowing] - Hey. - Hey. Need some help? Actually, you have an invite. [Jack's mum] Her mum heard we moved into town. [Jack chuckles] Go-karts are for kids, Mum. Uh, you're a kid. I prefer you driving one of those than pulling cupcakes in my car. - They're called donuts, thank you. - I know what they're called. - Stop doing them. - I won't even know anyone. That's the point. You'll go to school with these kids once the holidays are over. I don't know. Look, here are your choices. You either go to the party, or you can stay here and help me all afternoon.

I'm a bit nervous about driving one of these things. - I've never done it before. - Neither have I. But I'm sure it'll be all right. Come on. Hey, it'll be an adventure. Who's the dude man? Dean Zeta. [Colin] State kart champion. Everyone thinks he'll win Nationals this year. Remember when I asked you if you were laughing with me or at me? It was, like, one minute ago. [Colin] Yeah, well, he and his mates laugh at me. Hey, out of the way. [laughing snidely] I know. They're dim-witted vulgarians, but I prefer to just ignore them and get on with my day. Come on. [upbeat rock music playing] [engine sputtering] [engine stops] That's embarrassing. [engine revving] [laughs] Woo-hoo! [Jack] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah! [Jack] How you going? [Jack laughs] Woo! [chuckles] Here I come, dude man! [Jack] Woo-hoo! [Jack] Yeah! Come on. Move! [man] Show no fear, mate. [Jack grunts] [Jack coughs] [sighs] [man 2] Hey, Patrick. Mike. Thanks for holding the party here. I appreciate the business. Yeah, of course. Have you thought anymore about coaching my boy? Can't do it. Dean has a real shot at Nationals this year. All he needs someone with experience to help him get ready. And you'd make a great asset to our team, Patrick. Well, like I said, that's... not gonna happen. Why not? Because your boy doesn't have enough talent and... I can't teach that. [Mike chuckles] [sighs] Yeah. Hey. How long have you been karting? Um... about ten minutes. - Really? - Yeah. You were pretty good. I don't know. I mean, I slid off. That's because you went on the outside of the track. That's where the marbles are. There were marbles on the track? Not those kind of marbles. All the loose bits of dirt and rubber from the tires are swept onto the outside, and when you drive over them, they're super slippery. Huh. Um, I'm Jack. - Mandy. - Nice to meet you. So you, uh... race karts? Yeah, but I prefer to make 'em go faster. So you're like a mechanic? Well, they're actually called chief engineers, but yeah. I want to work in Formula 1 one day. - Cool. - [Dean] Mandy. Ready with the cake. Okay. - All right, I'll see you soon. - Yeah. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - That's a nice dog. - Thanks. Looks like he's got rabies. [laughs snidely] What's your problem? When you spun off, you nearly took me out. I think you're mad because I almost beat you. [Dean's friend] Ooh. See, that would never happen. [Jack] I had you. And you know it. [Jack groans] [cackling] [sighs] Stay out of my way. That's your first and only warning.

[laughter echoing] [whooping] [police siren chirps] [indistinct radio chatter] [woman sighs] - [sighs] - [car door closes] Evening, Dennis. After everything that happened in Sydney, you take my car again, two days after we get here. Mum, I was in the middle of nowhere. I mean, there was no traffic. And I'm driving a station wagon. Isn't that true? Um... You were chucking donuts in an empty car park, son. [policeman] Without a license. I apologize, officer. It will not happen again. Well... considering there was no harm done, I'm prepared to let you off with a warning. A stern warning. If I catch you at it again, you will be in very hot water. Understood? Well, I should hit the road. The old frog and toad. [sighs wearily] Uh, I'm... Officer Barry Johansen... - by the way. - Sorry. Christie Hooper. Pleasure. Have you just moved into town? Yeah, we're taking a lease on a shop on Queen Street. - Really? - [Christie] Yes. That's great. Well, I might see you around sometime, at some point. In the future... perhaps. Okay. [Barry] Okay. Evening. [Christie] Thank you, officer. - Bye, Barry. - [Christie whispers] Jack! What? [Christie] You're doing donuts again? What's going on? Nothing. Well, why do you keep doing it? I don't know. That's not a good enough reason, mate. One day, your luck's gonna run out. And it won't end well. I'm hoping that we can build a life here. You know you can tell me anything. - Maybe you want to talk to me about Dad... - Mum, I'm fine. Look. I got sausage because it matches the color of this house. [chuckles] [upbeat rock music playing] [go-kart engine revving in background] Far out. It's so expensive. So... you've been bitten by the racing bug. Is that when you can't stop thinking about how much of a rush it is? And you feel like it's what you were put on earth to do? That's it. Then I've been bitten. Well... [sighs] I think that's great. Now... I reckon you should turn around... go home... and never speak of it again. [Jack] Excuse me? You had one three-lap race in which you spun off and finished last, and now you want to make it your life's work? You know what would be a better idea? Collect every dollar you have, and your parents have, and your friends have... and buy the nicest boat you can. Park it in the middle of the harbor... blow it up... and watch it sink. That'd be a better use of your time and money than trying to make it as a race driver. Wow. You're the worst. Hit the bricks, kid. You don't want this life. - And your prices are too high. - [flies buzzing] No wonder no one's here. We don't open for three hours. Well, that explains it then. Actually... I do want this life. That's not the problem. I don't have enough money to pay you to drive here. And when I say enough, I mean any. It's not a charity. I've got an idea that could work for both of us. I'm listening. Clearly, this place needs some TLC. Is that right? So employ me to help out, but instead of paying me... let me drive three laps of the track for every hour I work. - What's happening right now? - I'm thinking. One lap. And only when I say. - Three, because the track is short. - One, because of fuel costs. Three, and didn't you hear what I said about the track being... One. And I'm not loving this backchat. - Three. - Two. Deal. - Would have done it for one. - Would have agreed to three. All right, you can start now. What's this for? When the track gets dusty, it's too slippery to race on. You're gonna spray it with water to keep it intact. You want me to spray the whole track using this? Indeed I do. Why don't we use that enormous water truck? [Patrick] I trust this backchat won't be an ongoing feature of our conversation. Make sure you spray evenly. And one more thing. Do not enter my caravan without an invitation. Ever. You understand? Yep. Hey. I googled you last night. It said you used to race cars. Won some big stuff. Less talking, more spraying. Get to it. You're burning sunlight. Chop chop.

Hi, Barry. [indistinct radio chatter] Does this mean I get to drive? I need you to wash all these. And... you're gonna do it with your feet. My feet? Your feet. You know that's super weird, right?

Regional championships are next week. Regionals? No. You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race. Then why am I spraying the track? Or painting the walls with my head? I need to do some driving. And you owe me 100 laps. You'll drive when I say so. All right? We have a deal. Well, I'm canceling it. You can't cancel it, it's a deal. Hello? Is this thing on? It's canceled. Hooper out. You're not racing in Regionals. But I will let you drive. Today, all right? All 100 laps. No stops. And when you're finished... you're gonna take everything inside that shed and put it in the bin. I'm gonna turn that into a snack bar. Deal? Yeah. - Yes? - Yes! Good!

[sighs] [hard rock music playing] Looks like one of the Transformers threw up. Yep. Know much about mechanical stuff? [Colin] Me neither. So, what do we do? I've got an idea. - [Jack] Hey. - [Mandy screams] What? Wait! It's Jack! Man, you scared the hell out of me. Why are you leaping out of shadows? - You couldn't see me? - They're shadows! Of course I couldn't see you! What are you doing here? Can you help me get my kart ready to race at Regionals? [Jack] And I don't have any money. So I can't pay you. In fact... it could end up costing you money. So what do you say? Well, since you put it like that... [chuckles] [Mandy] Why are you asking me? Well, I don't know anything about karts. And I don't know anyone who does, except for you. So you're asking me because you didn't have any other choices? Absolutely. And that I think you'd do a good job. - I'll do it, but with one stipulation. - Okay. I'm chief engineer. That means I'm in charge of the kart. Deal. See you tomorrow? [Mandy] We'll see! Cool. Woo! [Mandy] You want to race this at Regionals? It looks like it was hit by a truck. Can you fix it? Was it hit by a truck? That's the way we found it. I can fix it. Let's start by sorting everything. Put the engine parts there, the brake parts there, the steering parts here, and the exhaust parts here. Clearly, we need to start from basics. Okay, listen closely. There'll be an exam afterwards. - That's an axle... - [Colin] Uh, Mandy? Yes, Colin? Will there really be an exam? No, Colin. That's the axle. This is the brake disc. - She's so cool. - That's the brake caliper... - I'm just happy there isn't an exam. - Yeah. [upbeat rock music playing] It's so... ugly. [Mandy] It's not ugly. You know what's ugly? Slow. And this ain't slow. So where do we test drive it? Are you sure we're meant to be driving on this? Sometimes you don't ask for permission, Col. You just do it and apologize later. Now, this is a test drive, so take it slow. I hear you. [laughs] I don't think he heard you. [uplifting music playing] [man] Idiot! Woo-hoo! Woo! [all laughing] Woo! [ratchet clicking] [sighs] Well, gentlemen, it's been real. - See you at the track tomorrow? - Yeah... about that. This was a one-off. If my dad finds out I helped a rival team... he'll go off like a frog in a sock. - Thanks. - No worries. Don't go on the outside of the track like you did at my party. If you get on the marbles, you will slide off. Hey, what if we get you a funnel? That'd be faster. Then I could just pour it right in there. [chuckles] Are you working at that kart place today? Um, no. Today's my first race. Oh, really? - Right. - Yeah. First race. Well, that's cool. I'll get Colin to FaceTime you. He'll FaceTime me? Yeah. Just answer the call. Race starts at 11:00. - Wish me luck. - Luck. - Bye. - Have fun! [indistinct male voice over PA] Hey. Out of the way. [laughs snidely] You know you can't let them treat you like that. I know. I just don't know what to do about it. You want to go home? No way. I don't want to miss out on an adventure. Yeah, mate. After the KA3 qualifying session, title favorite Dean Zeta is in first place! In second is Jess Hoyt, with Juliet Kay a solid third. Top three finishers in the upcoming final move straight through to the State Championships. [in unison] I attack until I lead. I take no prisoners. I never concede. Whoever said winning isn't everything is a fool who knows nothing. I am unbeatable. Go do your thing. [announcer] This race is in the KA3 class. And just a reminder, the top three finishers go straight through to the State Championship. [cheers and applause] Come on, Jack. It's my son's first race today. - Oh, how nice. - Yeah. Okay, here they come, folks, in formation. Two by two. We're getting set for a start. Green light's on. We're off and racing, folks! Oh! That was a lunge, with a capital L! Dean Zeta takes the lead, and he's streaking away. [exciting music playing] And young Hooper now thunders through into tenth place. - He's inside, he's outside. - That's good. He is wearing this go-kart like an old suit! They're quite zippy, aren't they? Is it safe? Well, they're wearing helmets. [chuckles] [announcer] Into ninth. From ninth to eighth. He's going after the champagne, the glory, and the gold! Come on, Hooper! You can do it, son! He's moving up into fifth. - Oh, this is sensational. - Keep going. Yes, Dean! Yes! [engine revving] He uses the whole of the track. He's got his eyes on first place for sure. - Jack Hooper takes fourth. - Come on, get out of the way! [Jack's dad] Show no fear, mate. [Mandy] Don't go on the outside of the track. You will slide off. Yeah! Dean Zeta, first. Jack Hooper, third. Come on, Dean! Go! [laughs] [sighs] [Patrick] What the hell are you doing? - Coming third in my first race. - But I told you you weren't ready. Which you just proved by making that reckless overtake. That overtake got me through to States. Yeah. It could have put you in a coffin. But it didn't. You should congratulate me. Where did this come from? The back of your shed. Not bad work. Did you do it? I had a lot of help from my mates. And I... I need help from you too. Will you be my coach? - [groans] - When I say coach, I mean teach me everything I need to know about driving. I don't wanna be doing any more of this spraying or painting or cleaning with my feet. All of that was to improve your fitness. All right? The spraying develops your arms, so they don't get tired when you steer. The painting strengthens your neck, so you can handle the G-forces when you corner. The cleaning improves your ankles' flexibility, so you can work the pedals faster. See? This is exactly why I need you to be my coach. - Are you thinking again? - Yes. All right, listen to me. I will coach you, but you are gonna do everything I say. Do you understand? No backchat. Okay. No backchat. Nice suit, by the way. [Colin laughs] Oh, those corn are great, by the way. You're gonna love it. - Thanks, guys. See ya. - Thank you. [sighs] [indistinct radio chatter] Mmm. Mmm. [upbeat rock music playing] No, no, no, no, no. Hi, Barry! He did not. [grunts] Not on my watch. [siren wailing] [over loudspeaker] Jack... I'm gonna get you to pull over and, uh, turn off your ignition, please. [Barry] Your mother is going to be very disappointed. [Barry] Jack? Hello? [Barry] Is this thing working? I'm ordering you to stop the vehicle. Please. Thank you. [clears throat] What on earth do you think you're doing, mate? I need you to ask my mother out on a date. What? - And why would I want to do that? - Because you like her. Excuse me? I don't... This... You... You... I hope your conversation skills are better than this on the date. There isn't gonna be any date, mate. - Why not? - What makes you even think I like her? Well, you haven't arrested me. The night is young. Ha! See? There it is. That's the type of cheeky banter my mother loves. Why are you asking me to do this? You're a cop, so you're probably not a criminal. And you're not wearing a wedding ring. You are single, right? - Yes. - Good. And I'm guessing your dad's out of the picture. Yeah. So, uh, what do you reckon? The thing is... when I talk to women socially, I have been known to freeze up from time to time. Okay. - Make that all of the time. - Okay, well... that ends today, Barry. She's inside. Take a moment to come up with an opening line. [Barry] All right. Okay. - Got it. - Good. Try it on me. Go. [affecting posh accent] Hey, Christie. Would you like to go out to dinner with me? Next week, perhaps? Why do you have an accent all of a sudden? - I don't have an accent. - You do! Okay, let's try it again. One more time, yeah? Okay. All right. Hey, Christie. Would you like to go out to dinner with me sometime? Sometime next week? [sighs] That was pretty good. - It was adequate. - That was all right. All right. Come on. Okay. [Barry exhales nervously] Good luck. [Barry] Ahem. - Officer Johansen. - Hey. Uh, is everything okay? Everything's cool-magool. [chuckles] Yeah. Um... Can I help you with anything? Yes. Christie, I was, um... Christie, I was wondering if you'd, uh... like to go out to dinner with me sometime... next week. Perhaps. Yeah. That'd be lovely. - Really? - Yeah. [both laugh] That's great! That's great. Um... I'll be in touch. Oh, okay. There we are. [laughs] Uh... Bye. [chuckles] [drill whirring] [Dean] So, Regionals went well. Didn't need to make those changes to the kart after all. I guess. "I guess"? What's that supposed to mean? The kart was fast. I won. Your changes weren't necessary. I'm just being honest. Don't take it personally. If your kart was fast, you would have pulled away. But you won by half a length. If you started anywhere but the front, you would have lost. I'm just being honest. Don't take it personally. Hey. Hi. I've been asked out on a date. - Really? - Yeah. That's cool. I don't know what you did, but... thank you. I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. [Christie sighs] You know you don't have to fix everything, right? You don't always have to be the strong one. It's okay if you want to, you know... show some emotion. That one. Hey, Barry. Welcome to race school. - What's that for? - [horn blast] Backchat. It will also be used as a teaching aid. - It's really quite loud. - [horn blast] Now get in. Sorry. Act like I'm not here. Place your hands on the wheel. [horn blast] Wrong. The correct position is nine o'clock and three o'clock. - It doesn't feel natural... - [horn blast] You'll always know which way your front wheels are pointing if your hands mirror their position on the steering wheel. Easy breezy. Easy breezy. - [bag crinkles] - [crunching loudly] When the wheel's turned, a string will be tied on the accelerator. You won't be able to press it without snapping it. But as the wheel straightens... it'll start to give you some slack. You can floor it. [fly buzzing] Ugh! I want you to drive as fast as you can. But you don't snap the string. You keep your hands at nine and three at all times. [grunts] Aah! [Colin thuds] Whoa. I'm all right. [uptempo rock music playing] Easy into the corner. - [horn blast] - Nine and three! [Patrick] Wait till we exit. [horn blast] Nine and three. - [horn blast] - [Patrick] Too soon. [Patrick] You've got to find that balance between the accelerator and the steering wheel. Yes? - [horn blast] - Nine and three! [horn blast] Keep the balance. Not so easy breezy now, is it? Huh? [horn blast] [horn blast] [horn blast] [Patrick] All right, that'll do. Right. Same time tomorrow. Hey. What if the race line is blocked? I mean, how do I get past? Well, each situation's different, so there's no right answer. But I like to apply the rules of the overtake. Be patient, analyze what each driver is doing, and take advantage of any mistake. What's going on? I wasn't very good today. [horn blast] Feeling sorry for yourself isn't gonna make you a better driver, it's just gonna make you annoying to be around. Yeah, but it pisses me off. Good. Use it. Hey. When I googled you, it said that you retired from racing in the middle of the season. [horn blast] Hey, Mandy. She never says hi to us. [Patrick] Accelerate out of the apex. [uplifting rock music playing] [horn blast] Remember your balance here. Take a tighter line. [Patrick] Okay, pull it up here. How was that? [chuckles] [Jack] Oh, my God. A smile! That's the first time I've seen your teeth. All right, don't get cocky. You've got a long road ahead of you. You've got to prepare your kart for State. Your friends are gonna help again? I'm in! Is he the one who made it quick? [Jack] He just found out the engine runs on petrol. We need the one who made it quick. - Hey, Mandy? - [Mandy squeals] What? [Mandy] Are you serious? You did it again. You really couldn't see me? We've been over this. They're shadows. What are you doing here? I wanted to thank you. I wouldn't have made it through to State without you. I know. Can you make it quicker? I don't know if I want to. - Why? - Because you didn't listen to me. I told you not to go on the outside of the track, and that's exactly what you did. The inside was blocked. The inside is always blocked. The trick is to find a way to unblock it. See? I need to know this stuff. You only say that because you want me to help you. Absolutely. That doesn't mean it's not true. Will you do it? I don't know. [sighs] I'll take that as a definite maybe. Is this all your handiwork, Jack? That's pretty good. I thank you. You're working with Mike Zeta's daughter? Yeah, and he can't find out I'm doing this. This is not gonna happen. All in favor of Mandy being chief engineer? Carried. You said you wanted the one who made it quick. [murmurs, sighs] Hey, I, um... I really appreciate you helping me out. No worries. I want to say thank you by... uh... asking you out. [chuckles] That'd be lovely. [sighs] [chuckles] Right, well... This is awkward. Yep. [Colin] I'll go see if Patrick needs anything. Anyway... I thought it'd be cool to see what you guys do for fun-ness around here. [chuckles] Does that smile mean yes? It means... I'll meet you at the Rollerdrome tomorrow at six. Cool. Yeah. - [knocking at door] - [Jack] Patrick? Hello? I'm off. [sighs] Oh, cool. [bass notes sounding] [bass string snaps] What the hell are you doing? Uh... um... I had to drop off your keys. Right, and somehow break a $150 Thomastik-Infeld D string. I'm sorry. Get out. Whoa! That's so cool. Get out! Okay. Oh, my God! You're so young. Who's your mate? Nobody. Out. [Jack chuckles] [police siren chirps] [siren chirps] G'day, Barry. Everything okay? Yeah, of course. Uh, no, not really. Thing is, I've got a date with your mother tonight. - Yeah? - And... I've come to realize that I don't know what she likes. So I need some advice. For example... what does she actually like? Uh... The music of Daryl Braithwaite. Just give me a second, mate. Braithwaite. Yeah. Um... [chuckles] Chinese food. Chinese. And, um... Steve Carell movies? I really did like 40-Year-Old Virgin. I'm just... I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm really boring. Then don't be. Look, don't talk about yourself too much. Ask questions. Listen to the answers. - Listen. - Make jokes. - Jokes. - Have fun. - Fun. - Yeah. That's gold. - Where'd you get all this stuff? - My dad. Well, he was a very wise man. Catch you later. [loud disco music playing] Wow. You look so lovely and... clean. Did you say, "Lovely and clean"? I mean, most of the time, you're covered in grease. You should stop talking now. Yeah. Yeah. [woman] Coming up! [chuckles] Well, we tried. I've got an idea. [Jack] Humongous Claw! You didn't have an idea. You just looked around, saw the Humongous Claw, and shouted, "The Humongous Claw!" Absolutely. That doesn't mean it's not fun. Hey? I mean... it's a claw that's humongous. Please give it a go. Please. [metal detector whining] Hey, do you wanna go and see the new Steve Carell movie tonight? That'd be great.

So no Steve Carell, no Daryl Braithwaite, no Chinese restaurant, no whatever else my son said that I'd like. Good thinking. Rightie-o. Although I'd still like Chinese food. Do you want to do that? Oh, good. Yeah, I'm dying for a dim sim. [slow R&B song playing] [Mandy] If you finish in the top three and you make it through to Nationals, it's my first step towards becoming the next Leena Gade.
