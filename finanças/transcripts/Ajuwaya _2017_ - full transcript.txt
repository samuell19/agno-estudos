The guy is still there oh And those are still the symptoms I don't even understand Many years ago, in a very remote village I came across a really Strange... err... disease The time and season of dread has come When our visitor will arrive And when she enters the village Whether it be man, woman, child or aged. You must not walk around at night. Men, you are not to mate with any woman. And even the woman should keep herself For all of the days that she will be here You all hear me. When my mother was alive, She told me... She said her mother, the mother who birth her mother, Who birth her mother, told her this story That one woman was taken by four men into the forest And they forcefully had sex with her. When they were done with her, then this large snake arrived. Seeing her a breath away from dead. This snake possessed her and took her form. Since then, She has always come to our village. And you know she sheds her skin, For the whole of 66 days. And when she wants to renew her beauty... She needs the seeds of four men to renew her beauty In truth, She lets us go about our business in the morning and in the afternoon But never go out at night. We must not mention her name, If you mention this one's name. Death has arrived already. This is a warning, A very severe warning, You hear? Be afraid of her, even her shadow, If as much as her shadow passes by you... You are dead. (Indistinct Chatter) Omo mehn! Ahah. This place ehn! Please gather the money, Lets pay up. It is 500 naira each I will give you 500 naira. I am not even sure of where we are going now. Baba, good day sir Good day Greetings Please... Please how far is the village from here? The village you all are going to is almost 10 kilometers away. Yeah, almost 10 kilometers. You will go down this way. You will get to a very large tree after about 5 kilometers, Just past the tree, you take the right Then, you will find a wooden plank across a rivulet. You will go past this small bridge, before you get to the village you are heading for. Ha! (exclaims) It is quite far... Thank you sir. Here is your pay. 500 naira right? Please lets get going, It is quite a distance Where is my bag? Driver, Wait! Okay, okay Okay so, I got posted to a village with this weird bunch of corp members He is a bush man, don't mind him Was I the one that asked you to serve? (Swears) Do places like these even exist? (Indistinct chatter) The long trek to Ejonla forced us to bond. I guess. There is no network coverage here at all. Where do we go now? Please, please. Is that where he said we should go through? Lets try here, Its here. Try What? We cannot just try, we need to be sure. The woman said we should go this way, Get to a corner and go straight down... this looks like the bend. Are you sure it is not the wrong direction? And then we would have to come back? (Argument) Brothers Let's pray for leading (Argument) Can you listen? Excuse me! For leading! For leading What leading? Lets keep going. Leader nani Let's pray for leading, my brothers There is someone leading us already, won't you follow? You won't pray for leading? I'm not going to come back if this is not the way oh Then you will stay there There was myself, Halima, Osas, Femi, Emem And Chidi Together we were simply a crazy bunch Femi and Osas struck it off almost immediately What did she say? Dont mind her when she sees my 'Johnny', She will understand So who is the Major General she keeps talking about? She says he is one of her man friends that she sleeps with. I knew it, this girl is a call girl... That is why she... Brother! (Sings) Omo... (Teases him) (Continues singing) See these girls We will pick one girl each, once we get to the corpers lodge You know the funny thing? Those two guys are not smart. Especially the one with the cap. He is only good at speaking English. After we are done with the girls, then we will interchange later. After interchanging, you know how it goes... We would have so much fun - They'll be looking for my 'Johnny' (Hailing each other) Guys Guys I think we should start going Look It's getting dark already The earlier we get to the lodge the better Are you serious?

Is it because you are the only one that understands Yoruba? Colins. Did you hear what she was saying? The Yoruba was thick but let's just follow her all the same Let's go first! Hold on... - What is the girl saying? She said that the name of the village is not big story like I said before, It actually means big snake Ehn! - Blood of the Lamb! And they celebrate the festival to worship the snake and it starts tonight. Tonight! Of all nights? - If you are joking better stop it oh Come come! Guy, what is all this about?

You just keep walking away Come here! You just keep walking away Thats what I said. Wait, does that mean that snake will be moving around everywhere? Guys see ehn, If this is how it is going to be My candid advice is that we should all just go back from here. I did not die in Benin, so I cannot afford to die in the forest! I have said my piece. Okay so guy, you can be scared, yeah? Ehn? You can be scared. No! Afraiding No you don't be afraid. Keep calm. See ehn Let me explain something to you African snakes are not poisonous Don't be acting like illiterate What! African snake aren't what? You are not sane Snake hasn't bitten someone in your presence. That's why you are talking nonsense (Mimicks) African snakes... Halima What's the matter Please don't talk about snakes She might have ophidiophobia though. That's the fear of snakes (Mocks) English man - Colins Are you aiming for the first position in this service - Calm down Followphobia. That one is monitoring spirit oh Let's just follow the lady - Let's go! My brother, I hate snakes. - Come let's go They are demonic - Let's go now oh It's okay now! Didn't she just say no more talks of snakes? I'm sorry my sister, but you have to be in charge Even if you talk about it, you be in charge We arrived at the lodge provided for us, just after dark No no, no! This place is too dark. We need to find light in this place For we are children of light And we can't be in darkness. No, no no. For the Bible says, let there be light Someone should try to find a switch. Ahaaa... And there was light I am in charge No way! You've got to be joking! Is this where we are to sleep? What kind of place is this? Madam, I don't understand. What were you expecting? At least somebody should have cleaned it before we got here Who would have cleaned it for you? Ehn? Who would have cleaned it for you? Is it funny to you now, right? God! How could anybody expect me, Emem, to live in a place like this? The principal should just reject me abeg, I'm no longer interested I'm going back to town oh. At least there are reasonable people there Ehnehn! So now... All of us who trekked the distance with you are no longer reasonable people, right? No problem, no problem Emem, let's go and look for place to sleep - Yeah? But where would we be able to sleep in this place? See how this place is filled with rat poop And anywhere you find rats, there must surely be snakes as well Will you stop it? What's wrong with you? She said she doesn't like it! See guys, I've found a clean room. Let's just go and sleep for tonight. Tomorrow we can sort out everything else, okay? That sounds like a very great idea As long as all of us are sleeping in the same place, then no worries Let's go and sleep What happened? What is it? Are you okay? Wait, wait wait. Just... Wait! Don't move oh If you move, it will get even worse Don't move! Wait, wait! Don't move, don't move. Just help her out It's just a moth That's why you are scared? Halima Halima I just felt something crawl into my hair (Indistinct conversations) I think we should just do what Colins said We should just sleep in one room, at least for this night You know how it goes I got quite attracted to Halima Well, a bit more than that, I think Halima , I am a hundred percent, serious, serious You boys are so funny So in your own words, you want to be my boyfriend I mean that foolish Osas boy came the other day and asked me if we can... What's the word? "Collabo" Halima you know Osas is not a serious person See, I agree that You know it might be too early , but... Ah come on I am not any ordinary girl, I don't fall for sweet talk. Come on Halima, I know that, and for me, it's not about... Sex? Come on, say it. I am not naive That's every man's story. Or are you not a man? Halima, I am not- okay... I'm... a man obviously, but what I am trying to say is... Even though I am a man, I like to believe that I am controlled. Oh! Everyone wants to say that "I am not like the others" "I am different" See, for example now, back in the lodge, Oas, Femi, that Emem girl she's... I mean everything they do kind of freaks me out But it seems normal around here. Do you remember Camp? Boys and girls climbing each other everywhere I mean, I am very sure Emem will... Just simply ask her. Chidi. Chidi! Yes? So you were in the room last night? And I kept knocking on your door for so long. You can win a sleeping competition for Africa. What do you want? What kind of question is that? I came to ask you for sugar, mine has finished And I can't get more till I go to town. In the night? So why didn't you come during the day? Seriously? Is it not when one is hungry that one looks food? Listen, what is that your name, again? Don't come and knock on my door in the night ever again, have you heard me? Anything you want to get from me, come during the day, don't come in the night Why can't I come during the night? Or did you bring a lady to your room? What is this? What are you trying to do? What? - Never touch me again Wait! You think I am those... Useless boys, Osas and err- what's his name? Femi That you can touch anyhow? My sister, don't try it I am fire! If you dare it again ehn? The Holy ghost inside of me will burn you! Don't try it! Halima, don't say that See, okay. How do I explain this to you? In the morning, I... I wake up, I see you and Chidi singing And It's amazing... the way you sing Your voice, the purity, like Halima. Really? You heard me singing in the morning? Halima, it's not every time that you find a girl that is so beautiful And now still has a pure heart like...how am I going to just ignore that? Look, Collins, I am immune to cheap toasting I have heard everything that you have said, and I am not interested Please! Why are you now frowning? At least we can be friends, right? We are already friends You know what? You are one tough cookie! Sweet on the inside, and also beautiful on the outside. Its amazing I swear Sweet? You don't know me. Well I know enough to know that I want to spend every minute and every second of the day with you Alright Stop! Change topic. Let's go Wait up. See I don't want to sleep with you now Is it by force? You don't force somebody to do what he doesn't want to do. Please shut up! Who wants this one? Who wants to sleep with you? Who wants to sleep with you? You this ugly rubbish thing? Kai it's not your fault! if you see me on the road on a normal day can you talk to me? Is it not this rubbish NYSC that is causing all this kind of rubbish That stupid MG, if he had done my posting properly will you meet me? Will I be talking to a dirty rat like you? Ah God! Me, Emem! So what have you found out about this people and their snake festival? That's the thing, nothing! And It is strange, because you know normally most people like to talk about their festivals and cultures and all of that But these people don't talk about it at all It's almost like when you talk about it They start looking at you with rubbish suspicion like... Wouldn't you? If you were in their shoes? I mean, a snake terrorizes these people at night. No. Whenever I think about it, I just want to leave this village immediately. - No, no no. Halima, don't tell me you actually one of those people that believe this Yoruba superstitious bull crap I have not seen one little tiny snake since we moved here. Nothing to even show signs that there is a colony of snakes anywhere It's just old people with old morals and old stories and... Yeah, I don't believe it either, but even the adults of this village are scared of the story. Haha of course they'll be now. That's what they grew up listening to snake this, Ejonla that, Ejonla this That's why I want us to actually investigate it, and we can actually do it together, at least Me?! Don't be dramatic Oh no! You are the one playing Indiana Jones Me when I see danger, I run Wow, you kill me, I swear! Hey guys. Good afternoon guys. Hey, Halle Berry. - How far? Hey, don't tickle me. See this Halima girl, She just acts like she doesn't do sex! What is wrong with her? Leave her, she is only pretending. The life of a corp member in a village is such a drag And the highlights of our stay were the days we got to go to town The long walk was always a delight as I spent most of it chatting with sweet Halima I never quite understood her praying with Chidi though. But it made her more facinating Speak my sister (speaking in tongues) Open your mouth and speak my sister. Speak my sister! Don't open your eyes! No no no. Close your eyes and speak Speak into the air (speaking in tongues) We remove every demonic sprit in this place Out in the name of Jesus. Out in the name of Jesus Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus. Give me your hand In the name of Jesus. Oh Lord Thank you. Thank you for my sister Lord, she will be in charge, in the name of Jesus In the name of Jesus! Yes, my sister, sit down. Let's sit.

This girl is a disgrace. This girl is a disgrace to womanhood Yes, she is a disgrace to corpers in this lodge Can you imagine? Last week I saw her coming out from Osas' room Now, where is she coming out from? She's coming out from Femi's room. What can you say about that? Don't judge her without knowing her story. It's not fair Listen my sister, My sister, I can't understand that! She knows what she is doing and she is enjoying it That, I cannot agree with. I cannot We all have weaknesses o! Let me be honest with you. Huh? I also have something that troubles me. What can that be? What issue is that? I have this bad thoughts about boys Listen to me, that is a small thing! Listen to me, I have dealt with that spirit. Yes! You know what? It can be quite stubborn But you know what? I can handle it. This kind of spirit requires prayers- special prayers. With that, we take care of it. Hmmm? Lets go my sister, let's go inside. God bless you. Come in, come come. So I want you to kneel down, let me pray for you and anoint you My sister kneel. God bless you Here? - Yes Yes, yes yes. Just feel free Feel free. Kneel down I want to anoint you and I want to cast out that demon That demonic spirit in the name of Jesus, out!

Please forgive me, please Really? So what type of demon is this one called? Sessebus. Chidi? You really think I'm an idiot, right? If only the others knew who you are? Please my sister, see, It was unintentional sin. The temptation was too much Please don't let the others know about this They will now start thinking that we have been doing it, while it just happened once Please, my sister please. Just leave me alone Please ehn? Please I'm begging you now Please it will never repeat itself again just forgive me this once Just promise me you will not tell the others, please. I won't tell anyone The people of Ejonla were so afraid of their snake However, a rumour ran that the bread girl was the one who became the snake every night I did not believe a word of it... - Trash - Dude give me my 200 naira. I don't understand how you keep winning in this games. You don't know anything about this game. Femi, how much have you made off Osas? This one, I have made 3,700 naira off him. Please buy hot bread for me Be nice! - I don't understand Do I look like your man friend? Or is my name Major General? Are you okay? - Great! Nice one That's how it goes now, right? Okay, no problem. You will still come around later Ah Emem... I was only pulling your legs? Please leave me alone. Please. How much bread do you want? Femi, will you buy for me also? Halima - Halle Berry I will buy four for you. I would buy six for you What are you guys buying? Buy for me please O'boy, I don't buy things for men. I only spend my money on pretty girls. Rubbish! Guy, see yourself, if I were a woman, your mouth would be shaking. I don't behave like you, Following a woman around like a fool What rubbish? Dude, are you calling me a fool? And so? So what if I do? Just take it easy please. I should take it easy? Or are the gods working against you? Ah! The gods are involved in this as well? If I slap you? What's wrong with you? You can't. - Ehn? You can't, I swear. Are you okay? What's wrong with... - Someone should warn this guy! I will slap your face. What's wrong with this guy? What's wrong with you? My brother What's wrong with this one? My brother - What? Calm down Me? - Do you want to fight? Get out of here I am fed up - What's wrong with this one? What is all this? You guys shouldn't start fighting like children. Please I am hungry. Who is going to buy the bread? Let us send Muyiwa... Muyiwa come. Hmm that reminds me, Muyiwa This your village's snake festival, what can you tell me about it? Haa! They say we should not talk about it o, Because you don't know where 'she' can be hiding. We've been in this village for weeks now, We've not seen anything like snakes. Are you sure they did not just tell you this thing to scare the villagers? Dude, don't start o! Is it 'cause you haven't seen any snakes? Don't call them to us! - We don't want... Uncle Collins, it is not a lie o One woman in the village says she saw the snake She say it is very yellow. She say the head small, but the body is big like a tree o. The woman is dead now o! That is either a python or what do they call it...a boa constrictor Where did they see it? She said... She said the snake entered her room and carried her child And we have not seen the child since then What?! A child? Wait, What! A child?! And the villagers are not doing anything about it? Wait, can't they just set a trap and kill this snake? Dude, they cannot do that kind of thing. They won't kill a snake that they bow to and worship. Nobody! Nobody can kill that snake o! Our forefathers back then Tried to kill the snake and shot it with many arrows, one night. The snake disappeared right from before them In the morning, the snake killed 21 people She crushed their bones and put them on the bush path so that all the villagers could see them. They had to give her blood sacrifice for one month! One month! Since that day, Mama Ejo's family are the people that can beg the goddess o! That is a lorry load of crap. In this day and age? What kind of incredible story is that? Mr, you have started with all your grammar, You just like to speak a lot of grammar. Your grandfather has not seen powers that will kill you. (Indistinct chatter) What's wrong with you? I want to leave this village immediately Eyah, Halima come now, it's okay Alright guys thats enough. See you guys that's enough ,no more talks about snakes, please Can you guys just relax? Killing a snake is actually not a big deal o haha Back in primary school we killed a snake, what's there, just set a trap for it. See this mad man. Uncle Collins this is not an ordinary snake o It's a humongous and yellow snake! Yeeeee! Muyiwa, come back! Muyiwa! What is wrong with him? Can you see now?

I know him he was in SS2 Ehnhn I remember I know he was either in SS1 or SS2. I wasn't too sure.. I noticed I haven't seen him around for a while, did he travel? Or did he change school? He has disappeared o What do you mean disappeared, you people have started again in this village The whole village- The whole village has been crying - Hmm Oh Ayo. Ayo. What happened, please? Tell me. They said... He slept with his brothers and they woke up the next morning and he was gone. Wait, what do you mean gone? Is it a pen that we misplaced? What do you mean gone? What are you saying? Are you thinking about what you are saying? Sir - Hmm He didn't just disappear o. Mama Ejo, mama Ejo said that the snake goddess - Talk, talk! The snake goddess swallowed him ...Swallowed him... wow wow Ayo you know what? I am disappointed in you I thought you were one of the... I thought you were one of the clever ones But it's clear that your intelligence quota is a bit low Sir, - Hmm? She even said that she found his clothes at her doorstep. - Okay... At her door step... wow wow, wow. Interesting - You understand? Don't worry you can go along Because its clear that you are one of the stupid ones - Thank you sir Your IQ level is low and I'm very very disappointed in you, Ayo What are you saying? She swallowed him She swallowed him Fear is one thing, but a missing person? For real? Because if you leave this matter ehn... - This guy, you are not understanding what his mother said to me Can you imagine she said she's not going to report her own son missing . Collins See ehn, you need to be careful about this issue. You have to calm down This guy I can't cool down - Seriously I can't cool down. It makes no sense First of all, a boy, a whole boy vanishes into thin air Then some juju woman that everybody seems to fear in this village tells his mother that oh the son has been swallowed by a snake What do the parents do? They go home and sleep and cry That doesn't make any sense you guys what's happening in this village? I don't know oh - Maybe we should ask Femi. Femi? Do you want it to get worse? Femi? Femi is too hot tempered If you all go to ask him, or Collins goes to him, Femi will strangle him while explaining Yoruba history to him, spitting all over his face. Like everything he is saying... You guy not everthing has to be funny Not everything has to be funny, you guys Let's do something about it, we are corpers. Let's go to the police staton let's make something happen Colins! We are taking you seriously! - Tell him o But there is nothing we can do about it See... If the parents do not want to go to the police for fear of some mysterious snake I think we shouldn't draw their anger by doing it for them. Why? That is the Truth - As in, very true Because honestly, it is none of our business. Mr Corp Member. You are not the only educated person here Because we are tired of you being too forward, please Osas, - What's up, babe? Please follow me outside, I need to pick up my clothes from the line Oh, so you're afraid of snakes And you keep saying it is none of our busisnes. Let me go and attend to you outside Emem! Halima, please tell me you understand what I am saying? I do. I really do. But... This is beyond our control, Collins But I feel guilty. I was the one that went to talk to the boy You did nothing wrong. Just... Just forget it. See, we are corp members here. We shouldn't do anything that threatens the villagers or make them hostile to us. Of course, you're right, you're right. But still... You have a very good heart And... that I... Kind of like in a man My concerns about the boy scored me some good points with Halima And I wasn't going to miss the chance to press my advantage Taking a hike through the forest is not my idea of fun I don't think I want to See eh Halima, can you just allow yourself and just trust me I promise that... I promise you it will be nice Alright. Let's do it. Up Nepa! I pledge in fact, that it will be worth this long climb I don't know where you are taking me Don't worry, trust in me That's the thing about you You are too stuck up Sometimes just relax Five... four... three Two... one...Yes! What do you think? Oh my God! Wait! Can you wait? Wait up, wait up, wait up. Halima! Wait up, wait up, wait up. How did you find this place? Is it not me? Indiana jones This place is so beautiful! You know, I could stay here bathing in the sun forever! Thanks for coming mehn, I'm really glad you came Thanks for making me come. You don't even know how that sounded in my head but... I don't kiss on my first date. Ouch! Okay, you realize that you could have just said that or given me a warning, right? You mean there is no other girl that has done this to you before? Let me think... Hmmm... no! Not in this lifetime. And I'm not even trying to sound corky but... See? You had it coming I don't think we'll make it back in time to the lodge before it is nightfall Halima! You are really scared of this snake business now, aren't you? It is not funny. Halima, Can you calm down? It is just an old wives tale. Haba! I don't care what it is. I just want to be back, safe in my room. You know what? I found out where the snake priestess place thing is. And I'm going to... Please, I don't want to hear anything about snakes Please Do you know what? I am going to run the rest of the way! Stay here - Ah you play too much Halima.

Anyway, I don't want anyone to see us together. Although, there is no one to see us, All of them have run into their homes. What about your parents? My parents have died a long time ago. Oh okay.

So how did Chidi get it? Wait, what's going on here? Where's...? Pastor Chidi also has this...? He got angry this morning because I asked him how he got it... If he claims he didn't sleep with Emem, how did he get ti? He said he doesn't know, then I said he is a fake pastor. Ah No! I am sure it was the same person that infected us all. You better shut up your mouth... What do you mean? Who did? Did you not sleep with the bread girl, Yewande? Did you not? Wait guy, you slept with the bread seller? You're dead mehn Shut up! Bloody fool. It's not your business. You know what? It's probably a UTI or a toilet infection, but... I don't have it and I know Halima doesn't have it- - I was just saying the same thing. You will be the only one to know if Halima has it or not, You are the one with her. You're the only one enjoying her company Ah O'boy! You guys should quickly go to the clinic already- - We are on our way already. - Chill now! Just help us go. The reason is that, I don't know, Halima is acting funny Her fever is still there.

Halima, please Halima, please Halima! Collins I need your seeds If I don't get your seeds, I die in a few minutes Don't worry Don't worry, I won't hurt you I just need little I'm sorry Halima, I can't give it to you I'm sorry You're the only one left!
