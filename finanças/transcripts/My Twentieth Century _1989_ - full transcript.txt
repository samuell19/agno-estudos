Up?n my w?rd: they're a nati?n. - And where d? they live? - In Hungary. - Where's that? - It's b?rdered by Austria, B?hemia, Rumania and Serbia. D?n't be kidding. Th?se lands were invented by Shakespeare. It's New Year's Eve. I should get drunk at least. I came over to the dining car too early. It'll now be difficult to make friends. Never mind. Dame Fortune always smiles at me. Here's her gift. Y?u kn?w, it's als? my first trip t? the Orient. I'm in?redibly lu?ky that y?u're als? g?ing t? C?nstantin?ple. I was re??mmended an e??ellent h?tel there. All Eur?peans stay there. It's quite a danger?us pla?e f?r a Eur?pean lady. They say the males g? ??mpletely wild if they see a w?man with?ut a veil. How enthusiastic you are. - And how boring. - But d?n't w?rry. I'm an e?perien?ed traveler. His face is almost handsome. Though it's somewhat soft. D? y?u kn?w that the m??n is p?siti?ned there quite differently? He's got a nice uniform. And so is his moustache... I could perhaps have a good time with him. Perhaps. It's horrible when these honest bourgeois persons get into a romantic mood. Well? Oh. He seems to be taking courage at last. AUSTRIA Hell?, there. - Hell?! - Hell?! Hell?! - D? y?u sm?ke ?igars, Miss? - N? I ?nly sm?ke a pipe. - G??d evening. - G??d evening. Feed them twi?e a day. Send ?ne ba?k right after the missi?n is ?ver. Here y?u are.

The passw?rd's still "r?se-water". Well, y?u d?n't believe it? - D? y?u think I'm lying? - The two of them get along quite well. T? put it mildly, I'm skepti?al. I'll get off at the next big city. I r?de ?n its ba?k up t? the se??nd fl??r ?n the steps. It was quite a h?rse. - Or shall I try to squeeze something more out of them? - Certainly. - C?uld y?u d? it? - I've got plenty of money. I t?Id y?u earlier. There's an elevat?r in ?ur h?use. This is Austria. But I know Vienna far too well. Oh, I g?t frightened. Can I fill y?ur glass? Thanks, en?ugh. N?, I'll sti?k t? wine. E??use me.

Peek-a-b??... peep b?? Well, still innocent. 1/8th sulphur, 6/8th potassium nitrate, 1/8th charcoal, mix them in a lead pot. A silk scarf to act as tamping. If only I could see the site beforehand... I've got to survive till tomorrow night somehow. I can contact them only right before the operation. Who knows how experienced they are here. Perhaps they're working with dynamite? No. If the clockwork is too loud, it will reveal me straightaway. Although it's easier to make my escape with it. The principle in mutual assistance in Nature. Captain Stansbury observed a blind pelican which was fed by the others. And how well they were feeding it. With fish they had to bring from at least 30 miles away. A person who knows the habits of rabbits described them as passionate players. Playing makes them so intoxicated that they think the fox is a playmate. The whole nature of the animals is filled with the need to communicate their emotions with others. They play, bark or meow to make the impression that friendly beings are around. And all this is as necessary a component of life and awareness as any other vital function. Hey you, doggy. Good evening. - Can you see, it's paying attention. - Let's screen something for it, perhaps it likes the cinema. Right? It hasn't seen anything of the world. Except the laboratory. Now, pay attention. Come this way. Come here, doggy, come here! What on earth are you doing? Not that way. Come here, doggy, come here. Start. Come, come, come... I'm hungry. - There you are. - Thank you. I'm greatly honoured madam... Thank you for coming. Good morning. I'd like to have a nice necklace, something special, you know. Very well, madam. There are some exceptional pieces in the safe. How very nice of you... Any problems, madam? All of them are so wonderful. I find it impossible to choose. Just a moment. Yes, madam. Would you send it to my place in the afternoon? Of course. Most recently he's been demanding a necklace from everyone. Worse than that, he imagines that he's a necklace himself. Oh? - Otherwise my younger brother is a shy boy, poor thing, but... - I see. - I've found myself in several uneasy situations in his company. - I see. - Well then, in the afternoon. - Very well. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Madam, I've brought the... - How very nice of you. Just in time. Oh yes. They are the ones. - Wait a minute, I'll show them to my husband. - Very well, madam. - Wait here. - Yes, of course. Excuse me, Professor, I just want to know which necklace you chose. Come here, my boy. Oh, he's staring at me. What shall I do now? I won't look at him. I won't look at him. I won't look at him. He's coming down. Is he coming here? Well, then, I' pull myself together. If he gets here, I'll cast an icy look at him. He's going away. Where is he going? He sat down. What is he doing now? He's grinning. I've been to many parts of the world. I never stay long anywhere. I heard in China... Unfortunately, I've never been to China, I've only been to India, but... I'm going to a very interesting place tonight. - Are you in the mood to come with me? - Well, no. I'm afraid, not. Don't be afraid, there will be some ladies and children there. And you can see wonderful things you can't even think of. - What are they? - That's a surprise. I can't go. But what are they? Tell me. Not worth it. Come, I implore. Where do you invite me to go? I'll tell you. But I can't describe why it is beautiful. Why? Is it impossible to describe? I'm sorry, I've got no time tonight. Shall we walk for a while? I see. You'd like to appear to be mysterious. Oh, no. You misunderstand me. You see, I don't even ask why you can't come. - Haven't you got time tomorrow? - I have. I mean... Well, I can find time. - Can we meet? - Well, after all... yes. - At the zoo? - At the zoo. A brilliant idea. - But why not come now? - I can't tell you the reason. - That's as far as you can come. - I'll go with you till the next block. - "Rose water". - "Lily". - Do you know how to render it operational? - Yes. - If it works with dynamite. - You can have it over there. No, I'd rather wait here for you to come back. I'm in a hurry. Thanks. If only it were over. Well, are you bringing it? What if the minister doesn't come? A bomb was thrown at the minister! - I almost failed to show up to meet you. - What do you mean? Imagine, a bomb blasted in the room. And you? - What happened to you? - Nothing at all, as you can see. Oh, good. They wanted to kill the Minister of the Interior, but he also escaped unhurt. The villain. He also escaped, if you have the assailant in mind. - The minister was not even injured? - He's alive and kicking. Why didn't you tell me you were going there? - Right there? - You speak as tough you'd known what would happen. Nonsense. But what's the good of going to such silly places? To the cinematograph? - No use going there, it's no use... - Curiosity is difficult to repress. - Nonsense. - Excuse me, may I interfere with your conversation? - Good morning. - The words the lady said are very noteworthy. I'd be only too pleased to tell you a story which can be instructive. Shall I? You'll see how silly I was. A stupid fool I was. Indeed. It happened in Africa when I was young. I lived there in the middle of a beautiful forest. One day I noticed a funny, hairless animal in the foliage. It looked straight into my eyes and was making terrible grimaces. The three of us, my younger sister and elder brother and myself appreciated his performance. Even our grandmother was unable to come up to his art. We couldn't stand it for long and though we were afraid, we moved closer to the white hunter. After all, we were three against one. First we looked at him surreptitiously not to scare him. He didn't run away. Instead, he began to make even more terrible grimaces. I tried to make contact with him. My sister cast an inviting look at him. Believe me, I'm not biased but my sister was indeed very pretty. Then I caught sight of a rope in his hand. I realized immediately that it was a bad omen. I followed the rope in the foliage with my eyes. And up there, high overhead, I saw a net. It was a trap after all. We had been shown such a thing by father. And then, rather unfortunately, I made a big mistake. I sent my sister and brother into the bush behind us and I went up to the strange hunter. I hoped if I'd be friendly to him, he wouldn't hurt me. Perhaps he would even play with us. But most important of all I cherished the hope that I'd be able to learn his trick of making such fantastic grimaces. I was more interested in them than in anything else. Since then, I've been living here. It's not such a cheerful story, is it? So much about curiosity. Bye-bye. It's only a simple sapphire, worth nothing. This place is not particularly convenient. Now let me see that man. Got him. Quite handsome. Perhaps I could try... How serious you are... Very often you can get along with this brand better. His suit looks fine but he doesn't really seem to be a man with money... GENDER AND CHARACTER A lecture by Otto Weininger Hungarian Feminists' Association As you probably know, the topic I'm going to discuss today is women's right to vote. Besides, I'd like to make my distinguished audience acquainted with my research results. I had the opportunity of subjecting them to tests using the strictest and most thorough scientific methods. And from them I could draw some general conclusions concerning the fair sex and the character of women. First of all I'd like to assure you that I deem it necessary, moreover indispensable, that women be given the right to vote under any condition. Hear, hear! Bravo! Over and above the right to vote they must be given equal rights in all areas of everyday life. Hear, hear! Please, stop it, ladies. After all, this is a scientific lecture. A scientific lecture. We want voting rights! Thank you. I think the right to vote is by all means essential. But emancipation of women can be demanded even without believing that men and women are on equal footing in moral and intellectual terms. What do you mean? Impossible! Right. Aren't you ashamed? Ladies! Listen to him! Silence, please, ladies. Aren't you interested to hear what he wants to say? Let's listen. Let's lend him our ears. Get out! Silence. Silence, please. Thank you. Thank you very much indeed, ladies. Although I doubt the extent to which my words will be effective. I'll tell you the reason immediately. Women should be beings capable of thinking in a logical fashion to be able to follow the train of my thoughts. This is one requirement, you know. The other is that they must have a moral acumen. It is quite obvious, however, that it would be wrong to assert that they possess either of the two. Throw him out. It's easy to see that women's being dissolves in sexuality. In the sphere of multiplication and coupling. No doubt, man is also a sexual being. But he is more than that. A woman is rendered very much uncertain if her thinking must be subjected strictly and exclusively to logic. Man is committed to logic but a woman is not, because she doesn't have an intellectual conscience. A woman is characterized directly by "logical insanity". A woman has no logic. Distinguished participants, the being that cannot recognize or, presumably, cannot even understand that A and non-A mutually exclude each other, this particular being can by no means be prevented from lying. Consequently, an independent ego cannot be assumed, meaning neither more nor less than an absolute woman has no ego. Ladies! Women can be divided into two basic types: the mother and the bitch. A woman possesses the bent for and aptitude of being a slut ever since her birth. The same applies to the bent for motherhood. The fundamental identity between the two lies in sexuality. I can already hear your protest, but this is true. A proof of it is the pleasure a mother can feel when breast-feeding her baby. The anatomical fact that erotic tissues lie under a woman's nipple is an additional evidence. Physiologists have discovered that irritation of those spots can bring about the contraction of the womb muscles. Clear? Have you ever had the courage to confess to yourselves what the man's sexual organ can mean to a woman, virgin or not, from a psychological viewpoint? I mean the predominant role it plays in women's life from the first moment to the very last? Even subconsciously. Look here, ladies. What's he drawing? I cannot really imagine... What a shame! ...that a woman can find the man's sexual organ beautiful or even handsome. She feels about it the same way as a bird about a snake. Or as a man feels about a jelly fish. She is enchanted by it. She is brought under the hypnosis of its hideousness. Because a woman feels that the phallus is her lot. Even if she fails to name it. This is the male's part that can excite her most deeply the moment it offers the most unpleasant and disgusting sight: during erection. This is the final proof of the fact that instead of seeking beauty, a woman seeks something else in love. A woman is not a being of deep or lofty reason, but she is unreasonable altogether. She is simply inexplicable. A nothing. She has no contacts with ideas. She doesn't deny them, nor does she need them. Because a woman is neither illogical nor logical. She is a-logical. A- logical. And consistently amoral. That is why she has no sign - to speak in mathematical terms. A woman is directionless. She's neither good nor bad. She's simply non-existent. There's no such thing as a woman. She doesn't exist. She's simply non-existent. Non-existent. Non-existent! Here's the back gate. - No dog inside? - This place will do. No one in sight. Give it to me. In exchange for a kiss. Give it to me. Only for two kisses now. Give it to me. Let me go! Bastard. Miss... Are you leaving? Good guess. But I can't climb over the wall alone. Well? Will you help me? It's most kind of you. What if I throw you off? You'd better look around to see if there's anyone near. What about the bundle? Guard it. You leave it behind? Don't you need it? I'm not going to climb after you. Don't you need the bundle? Don't wait, throw it inside. If I only knew why they are so self-assured. What? You believe a woman is completely resolved in the sphere of multiplication and mating... I mean... - You must realize... ... just... ...women's anticipation will go beyond the acquisition of the right to vote. I can assure you. A woman is no object to a man. You mean you didn't enjoy it? I don't think you are that much of a hypocrite. A woman is... - What? - She has a life of her own. Tyrants of your brand will soon be swept away, too. - Are you around? - Yes. The time is not far when mothers will handle dynamite instead of making coffee. Sure. Right. Don't talk. Someone's coming. Keep silent. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Give me a light, please. - I don't smoke. I'm here. He's gone. You can speak now. Look here. I didn't mean to hurt you. Understand? I think you're too young. Am I right? Why are you silent? At your age one tends to take principles too seriously. Am I right? You're such a nice girl. This doesn't suit you. What are you doing? Are you crying? Why are you silent? I'll tell you something. I love you. Hey, you, up there, stop! Come down at once. Call the police. He's up there on the top. Come down immediately. Surrender. Don't touch them. Leave them alone on the ground. Do you remember the way I separated the plate, knives and forks? It was still impossible then. He was active in Piraeus then. But he never calms down. - My boy! - Yes, captain. A real Havana. I still have dozens of them. Believe it or not, I was sitting on a knot on the rope and smiled all the time. Thank you. Excuse me, please... Go ahead. - Will you have some, sir? - No, thank you. Do you want to try it? - Number of your cabin? - 22. Is it you? - It's a bit too late, don't you think? - Keep silent. What a face you are making! What did you say? - Unbutton it in the back. - Excuse me. That's it. - Oh! - That's the way. How complicated. At last. Where were you? You're ridiculous. - I'll make you tell me where you were. - Leave me alone. - Tell me where you were. - Nowhere. Don't be cruel. - Leave me alone. - Let me go. Oh, my darling. Please, release me. That's it. SIBERIA - Hey, Lily! - Lily! Lost your way? Where are you running from? - Lily, can you hear us? - Lily! We're here, behind you. - What happened to you? - Your dogs ran away from you? You're moving in the wrong direction, towards China. Europe's in another direction. Do you hear? - Can you see us? - She doesn't understand. She's too tired and cold. Higher! Here we are. Lily! What would you like us to do? Shall we sing for you? Are you listening, Lily? This way. Come this way. How much is it? Tell me. Only five pence. Thanks, Miss. What an encounter. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Shall we go to my place? Well? Well? Does it meet your expectations? How do you like it? A very pleasant place. Not very luxurious, as you can see. You'll find the washbasin there. You can have towels, too, over there. I cook here, too. The bedroom is to the left, take a look. A very comfortable bed. You'll see. Go and see. Go. The window looks on a small garden. Birds awake you in the morning. And cats prevent you from sleeping at night. Just go ahead and take a good look around. By the way, I keep my money over there, in a box on the dressing table. What? "The principle of Mutual Assistance in Nature. " "Birds are in the habit of getting together to dance. Rabbits get so intoxicated by playing that they tend to regard foxes as their play-mates. " Now, my duty concerns the points here in this environment, and then... Are you bored? As I can see you don't feel uneasy at all. Or do you treat everyone in the same way as you treated me? I came to regret it. Believe me, I paid a heavy penalty for it. But I've changed since then. I'm not so self-willed any longer. Believe me, I've often thought of you and... I'd like to compensate you. I mean it. It will be difficult, you know. Too late to light a cigarette? Go ahead. We've got time. - You seem to have lost some weight, right? - Don't know. Why are you short of words? Me? Well, I... Never mind. You can now start undressing. Yes, that's it. Good. You're doing it quite authentically. Almost like a real innocent girl. Although you overact a bit, don't you think so? All right. You can accelerate the pace a bit. You see, I'll assist you. But no need to hurry. Excuse me, but I'm very much embarrassed. Well... It seems you didn't lose weight after all. Well, let's get down to work. That's it. Where are we going to do it? - Over there in the kitchen? - Oh, no. Or here on the floor? It's dusty, very different from a luxury cabin of a liner. I found a better place. In the armchair. That will do. Try to lift your backside. That's all right. That's it. Damn. Evening Herald! Evening Herald! Late edition! Hot news! Evening Herald! Late edition! It carries sensations! No. Please don't. Help! What is it? Give it to me, please. She ran that way, catch her! Is that you? Yes, of course. Hey, you! Hide yourself. Here he is, he came in. I saw. Speak to him. Got no courage. Nor have I. Then wait a minute. I'll pull myself together. Hey, you. What's your wish? - He can't answer your question. - He's frightened. Word it differently! Wait, I'll listen to his heart. Silence! Hide yourself. Throbbing? Yes. Can you hear? Even faster. How fast? - How? - Faster and faster. Hey! Tell me, which woman do you think you'd be happier with? Tell me. We'll help you. - What did he say? - I didn't understand what he said. Be silent. I can't hear in this confusion. Silence! I think he prefers Dora. I think he wants Lily. - He wants Dora. - Lily! - Dora! - Lily! I'll hit you. I'll hit you. Silence! If he's a bit sensible, he wants Dora. - Lily. - Dora. - Lily. - Dora. Silence! - Right! Ask him about it. - Fine. Tell me, do you want both? What? He wants two women? He wants two! Why not three? That's more interesting. But now... Now I understand. He wants one. - Only one? - Only one. Mr. Edison. Just one word about your invention. Gentlemen, calm down. Gentlemen. As you know, following the establishment of our Tokyo office, it has been made possible for the human word to race round the world. There are our employees sitting at the wireless telegraph stations, waiting for messages which are forwarded at the fastest possible speed. A telegram you send can reach us here in New York in exactly five minutes, spanning oceans, Europe and Asia. The text of the telegram is this: "... It's a wonderful world created by God and so is man, who has now learnt to mould it. " And now let's set out watches. At eight o'clock sharp, in 14 seconds, the experiment will begin.
