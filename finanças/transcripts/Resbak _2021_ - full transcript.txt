She's got tons of fake plates, and registration papers. Isaac? Yes. Plates and registration papers are safe. Fresh from the factory. She is the master of illegal procedures. Is this the one? Still looks good. By the way, here are the documents. The papers are clean. Everything's good. A friend at the transportation office fixed it. Don't be scared of the checkpoints. The district and patrol guards have been for warned. I have them by the neck. Tear it apart! Sort out the spare parts. And you, Jerik!
