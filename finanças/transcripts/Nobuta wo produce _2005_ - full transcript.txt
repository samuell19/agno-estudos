Okay! Hey, what are you doing? It's dangerous! You can't come in here! That right there... I'm just gonna touch that just a bit... What are you saying? So... unless I touch the willow tree... I can't go to school. I decided this on my own. No, it's dangerous! I'm telling you NO! Even if I explained it to them... these men wouldn't understand... Yay! If I pass by the market in two minutes, I'll make it to school right in time. According to what I think, everything in this world is a game. Gather! Actually... I don't actually believe that, but unless I think about it in this way, I can't get through every day. Are you guys actually gonna do this? Gather! Again! Gather! Too slow! Again! You remember what I said before... Counting how many times he does that... (he's tallying how many times the teacher pulls up on his pants) Understand? OK the last one... Everyday is just a repeat of useless stuff. You didn't know? That was about.... people talk about stuff, and I want to say back... That has absolutely nothing to do with you! Saying it just because they saw it on TV! What are you drinking? It's called "Everywhere Honey Honey"! What's that? Beetle food. People who in many ways might even be "dangerous". In a world with all these kids the one who becomes "serious" loses (the game). Shuji! Wanna go karaokeing? Look at what you're saying... you guys haven't paid me back from the last time! Of course I'll go. Oh but... the teacher called me to see him after school. Without Shuji, it's no fun. What? The usual place? - Yeah. When I'm done, I'll come join you right away. Even if you wait 100 years I'm not going! Don't sing that song... If I keep acting cool, and keep my status without getting hurt, I can reach the goal. So... today as usual, be cool. But a friendly, helpful, Kiritani Shuji-kun is a tough act to maintain. But even for a person as perfect as me there is an enemy I fear... Found ya! Kusano.... - God died. Who'd you hear that from? From some philosopher. But do you think god could die? I mean, what do you think he could die of? Hey, don't ignore me! I know... You open yourself just to me. Hey!! Shhh... Don't say it! We're friends, right? No we're not! I'm gonna say this right now... We're not friends, or anything! So. You're hiding it right now too! Then, as a friend can I say one thing? Of course! When you walk down the stairs you know how you move your hands like this... - you should really... - i don't do that lose that behavior. I'm saying don't wave your arms like that! I seriously hate him. It's not there, the willow tree! Why? The willow tree, it's gone! Gone! The willow tree, why? It was my one comforting place. Hey!!! Fish!! Why isn't it here? Tell me! Heyyy... Willowww... where are you? Willow!! Could that be... the willow fairy? What? What do you want? What? The willow tree.. If you're looking for it... it's not here. This afternoon they pulled it out and took it somewhere else. Oh. Really? It was a willow so it wasn't the best thing for hanging myself from, but... Whaa..?! Hang yourself?! The way it was shaking... it didn't seem like something in this world, and it was kinda good. Um... Does your stomach hurt? Why? Umm... your face looked like it did... I smiled. Yeah, you smiled... Smiled, you smiled. The day the willow was pulled out she came... having grudges towards everything in the world that girl... and... thinking everything in the world was meant for him this stupid guy. Because of them, my peaceful high school days slowly began to change. But at this time I had no idea about these things. In other words, what that means is... Oh... My life after this.... I don't exactly want to talk about it. === *** Nobuta Fansubs **** == . . Translator: dancestar24 Editor: pokute Timer: mystery korean Timing Provider: tianj Morning! Good morning! Good morning!

Yes... the used book store downtown. The store that forbids anyone who's not good looking to read at the store without buying. Sebastian challenged this policy. Yes... that weak teacher Sebastian, he decided to try. But he couldn't manage it. Then Bando went to do it too. - Yeah, that really "kebai" (overly made-up) girl. Bando-chan, without knowing what was what... What are you doing?! you OK? - That guy! What are you doing! Kebai girls not allowed!! - Isn't that kinda sad though, she couldn't even go into the store. Yeah. That's so mean! But is there anyone who has managed it? - Probably not. There's one so far right? Who? Who? Who? Class A, Uehara Mariko. Oh, Uehara Mariko, Makes sense. That means Uehara Mariko's reign will continue. Did you hear? A new student! Serious? Guy? Girl? Girl. She's supposed to be prettier than Uehara Mariko! Seriously? - That's amazing...

New student! Come on in! Come in! Eh... Ehh? She's not Yada Akiko! But... - Be quiet! Ah! Willow!! Ah, you know Kiritani? She says she doesn't know you. Even Kiritani Shuji-kun has gone crazy in shock. Then why don't you introduce yourself? Okay, let's see... She's Kotani Nobuko. this is an introduction time, so if you have any hobbies or anything? None. What you wanna do in the future, or what clubs you wanna join? None. There's none, right. Okay... So, please be nice to her everyone! Your seat is the second row from window, two seats from the back. That's open. I'm sitting here. Bando? Since when have you been sitting there? From a long time ago. I see. Go back to your actual seat. Why do I have to move? Please don't cause trouble. Okay? go back. Okay, please sit in that empty seat. Okay. I'm gonna take attendance. Aoi? -here. Takashi? - here. Inoue? -here. Did you see that? - Yep. You saw it, right? Hey you, you just swiped the desk like it was dirty! You wanna say that it was dirty 'cause i was sitting there? Stop it. Go back to your seat. Bad atmosphere... Destiny, come forward and entertain us with your jokes! Yay! Ready... a small hat = firefighter (a pun, firefighter= shoboshi, sho=small) Dunno what he's saying, what's that mean? You guys don't look so worried after your joke. Well because... Hey we said it together! Is this a "Destiny"? OK, enough of the "house act". thanks Destiny. OK let's continue attendance... Kimura? - here. Kiritani? -here. Kusano? - here. OK, you guys all think since the circumference is 3.1... so therefore x is? Doesn't she have a bad attitude? Be careful. Isn't she scary? Yamada? Doesn't she smell bad? Mariko, what's for lunch today? Broccoli shumai. Broccoli? Yay! Shuji, she's here. Bye-cycle! Bye-Bye-CYCLE! I'm proud of the lunch today! Seriously, I'm so excited! Let's go. Shuji, Is he going out with Uehara Mariko? If not would they eat lunch together everyday? Uehara Mariko's lunch... I wish it would be on eBay! So stupid... by the time you get it, it'd be too old. Looks so good... WOW! So good! I'm so happy to be alive. The new student was Yada Akiko, I heard... Oh it's a lie. She's scary! Really? This broccoli is so good! That's where we always eat. Can you move? Hello??? Can you hear us? Hello??? What's wrong? You can't hear us? Sorry... I didn't mean it. I feel bad, let's go. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Umm... Don't! If you talk to her she's gonna follow us around! True. Where do you wanna meet? - Huh? You forgot? We promised today... - I remember, seriously. What time do you want to meet? Sorry. Today I have something else I have to do. What's that? Uhh... A funeral. A funeral!? Seriously? - Seriously... See, look. You're right. - Sorry. Then let's change the date. Okay, when can we? When... When should we? I'm looking for a place to throw this out, and today there's class here so you can't do it here. Go outside... you don't know where? I'll take you there. - Huh? This is Yada Akiko of our class. She probably doesn't know where to go, so I'll take her. Let's go. What really happened? Did someone do it? Like Bando? Doesn't really matter since it's not my business. Why don't you go back? Your girlfriend is waiting. Oh, it doesn't matter... in fact she's not my girlfriend. What about the funeral? - Oh that... It was a lie. But the tie? This morning on my way to school i found it. I thought it might be useful for a sudden cancellation. Then don't make a promise you don't intend to keep. That... Exactly. Catherine! Hey Kiritani! Things done on a whim don't always work out. Why... are you on top of the... To go around the school takes forever... It's a waste of time. YOU should teach HIM to be a better person. Who's that? Vice principal. Vice principal. I thought she was a "crow woman". That's scary! I heard it's someones parent. What are you talking about? Here you go! - Thanks. There's someone who climbs over the school to get in. What's that? I saw her too, It was an older lady. Annoying. But that's.... What? What? - Oh, nothing. Ohhh... Is there a rumor among the students? Do you know who it is? Uh... well... According to everyone else... that it's a "crow woman". - What's that?! That's what everyone said. Can't find it. Gone! My key's gone!! Found ya! I'm saved!! What? I lost my bike key. So? Let me on. - Impossible. But, you're already on! Stay within the white line... Be careful! Let's go! Don't hold on to me! God! After crow woman it's a crying guy! Hey look the cabbage is cheap. Hey look the cabbage is cheap. OK, go left now. Be careful! Next stop will be Hirayama Tofuten! Hirayama Tofuten. - Wanna come in for a drink? - Drink what? "Ma-me chi-chi" (misreading "Tonyu") You're back! I'll have two mame-chichi. - Oh, you mean tonyu? Oh, it's called tonyu? It's not mame chichi? Why didn't you tell me? Name doesn't matter as long as it's good. "buriburi" This is your house? No, boarding here. Oh, you're house is far away? My house is the top floor of that building. Ehhh!! That mansion? - Yep! You're rich? Yep. What does your dad do? my dad... is in that building on the right side... top floor, he's the president. President? President. President. President. Then why are you here? My dad said to me: You're gonna inherit the company, so have fun during your high-school years... Enjoy your youth to it's fullest... spend your time wisely... then choose a cake quickly, before they're all gone. So, wait... I dunno what youth is all about. Well, I think... it's doing something no ones ever done or yeah, yeah... use all your energy until you can no longer go on... stuff like that. So what are we doing? Think of that yourself... just choose a cake quickly. Soo... I don't care which one. You pick, Since you can't choose either one doesn't it mean you don't want either one? Really? I'm leaving. Hey wait.. Ouch! I don't want either. Such an answer exists! The scales have fallen from my eyes. Ouch! I dropped my contacts. Watch out! - Thanks. I dropped my contacts. Brother... Koji, what's wrong? Mom.... - Huh? Anyways just come, hurry... Hurry hurry... Dad why are you home so early? What? An airplane accident? Mom was...on the.. Eh??!!! Seriously? Seriously? Why? Kiritani Nobuko-san (his mom's name) Oh my god, the phone... Her cell phone! Hurry hurry! Call her cell! OK I'll do it! I'll do it! Please, pick up... Why isn't she picking up? [home] She isn't picking up. Who is it? Calling for identity verification? Can't can't... Just pick up!! Yes? Mom? Seriously? Doing well? What do you mean where am I? I'm in Nigeria! I'm working! What's your dinner tonight? Wait... Today's dinner? Hurry, hurry! Dumplings! Hello? Dumplings! Dumplings? Dumplings... Dumplings... Dumplings. He hung up. It's delicious! What did she say? She said dumplings, dumplings! That's all? - Yeah. She's alive? Then let's eat, let's eat! She's alive... - She's alive!! She's alive!! Thank god! Why are you putting a chick? Who cares as long as the hole is covered! It's the same as Watanabe... Oh, is Watanabe... a girl? It's done. Looks good. Yay! Not fair! But you know... - Huh? Somewhere in the world there's a family that's in sorrow. Putting in 'flower'. kon nichi, getsu, ka, sui, moku, hey! It's escalating... Isn't that too much? It's a joke. You like jokes. You can't really laugh at that. I mean isn't there something better... Eh? Remove, remove, remove... we're aiming for a more.. dry joke. Okay. Yeah yeah, so boring. Always like that. Too sad you die in two days. So sad. What's with her? She really annoys me! - Let's go. She's seriously gonna be picked on. Shu-u-ji-kun! Pass? - Yeah. Well, it's none of my business Found ya! Don't touch me. Hey! What do you want? - It's for you. What's this? It's scales. It's contacts. It's the "scales that fell from my eyes"! I was inspired from what you said. This is contacts. You were exactly right. See? What? - Actually... I don't have anything i want to do, and I don't want anything. And then? You gave me a scornful look. No. Because I'm a guy who has nothing he wants to do. Isn't everyone like that? Ehh?! Scale. Bye! Ehh?!! Wait for me!! Wait! What's with you? Say something! You, why are you ignoring us? Stand up! We're talking to you, So say something. Let's all get along! Don't look inside the girls' room! Wait! You guys, Sebastian's coming! Seriously? - There's water here too. Cold, cold, it's so cold! Cold, cold! Wet, wet, we're wet!! You... Can't you act more normal? Like try to fit in? Do you think about such things? Yeah, yeah. Changing yourself slightly can make a big difference. There's nothing I can change. No? Impossible. There's nothing I can change. What's with giving up from the beginning? I've thought about changing myself in the past... my mom remarried, I had a new dad but i couldn't adjust, but, i thought that was bad, so I tried really hard, i tried really hard and said, Dad... Oh sorry, I married your mom, but I'm not your dad. I was embarrassed. I was so embarrassed I wanted to disappear. Saying that if you have courage you'll make it or open your heart to others and you'll get along... I don't believe that stuff. I mean, even if I believe and open my heart, I'll just feel miserable. You can't say that. I don't care. I've gotten used to being bullied, it's always been like this. And probably from now on too, how can you get used to it? Getting water sprayed on you, getting your lunch thrown out, are you OK with that? Hey! Don't decide like you're not gonna change before you even begin! I mean, we have to live through it. We all have to, in this little school. Bando doesn't give up easily. She said she'll forgive me if I read at Go-yokudo. Go-yokudo... Only good looking people can read there. She said to read there today. Impossible! She just wanted to laugh at you 'cause it's not possible. Yeah yeah. Let's go read! Come on! Why are you stopping here? Hello! Can I have a book? Which book? Right, it's all the books here... Then from here to... here. There to there? Can I leave the books here for 2 or 3 days? Yeah, sure. And for research, we can read here? Yeah, sure. Really? Okay one sec... We're going... She's gonna come to read so... Okay. Okay, pay. I'm paying? You said you were gonna help, hurry up! Can I use this? It's gold? Yeah. The two of us together we're 'Destiny'. Please listen. A new record! Reading time... 2 hours 10 minutes! In shock! She beat Uehara Mariko! It's the scary new student, Kotani Nobuko! Shocking! They have lowered the standard. Sebastian went to challenge again. But sadly enough only good looking people can read. Kotani-san look this way! Kotani-san! Please get closer! Thanks! Smile! Cheese! [new student class B] It was fun! The whole school is talking about it! They're all bored. No one realized that we... Doesn't it smell good? Right? It's popular. Seriously. Feels good! Let's try to be happier. Now Kotani won't be bullied. She's gonna be bullied again. Really? Listen, when a person this low wants to become popular, becoming normal isn't enough. Unless she goes to top level people aren't gonna change their opinions. Exactly. Then let's bring Kotani to the top level! Don't say it like it's gonna be easy. Well, the inside has to get there too... The inside doesn't matter so much. If everyone says she's pretty, then she's pretty. If everyone wants something, the price goes up. There are people who made the world work like this. What people? People 'up there'. Eh? My dad? Not just one person... These people, they're thinking of ways for us to spend more money. Even if it's not a good song they can make it a hit. A normal girl becoming a star... Making a line form in front of a bad restaurant... In other words... producers, or whatever they called. I see. Cool!! Let's do it!! Let's make Kotani the most popular girl in school! For what purpose? You said so before... To do something no one else has ever done. I said that, but... We can produce Kotani. We? We... Aren't you more the one who should be produced? That too. You can do me too! Why? Please Kiritani Shuji, producer! I'm beginning to see my youth!! Counting on you. [new record 2 hours 10 minutes] Is it possible to change the world? Even people like us? No i don't want to. Why? I don't wanna lie. Even that business about the bookstore, I'm not really pretty. But that's what everyone thinks! Who cares? It's only important what people think. I'm gonna tell everyone the truth. Why? Don't. Kotani. Isn't right now your chance? Unless you change yourself you're gonna be picked on for the rest of your life. You're seriously gonna be pulled out, like that willow. Are you OK with that? That's why I said nothing's gonna change. This world is the same no matter how far I go a world I can't live in. It just goes on and on. Then make one! A world where you can live! I'll make you one! Yeah... he'll make one for you. I don't need it! Ohh! Kotani! I'll make it for you! You're so into it. Even if I'm into it, if she's not then it's not possible. Yeah. Your youth, already it's shattered... Bang! Yeah. Oh, Kiritani help me here... come on Kiritani! This? The top box. You OK? Come on, clean up. What's this? This...? it's a monkey's hand. What's a monkey's hand? You don't know? It grants you 3 wishes. With this? Ohh! Lucky! Found another one! I'll give it to you. Your wishes... You have to say it aloud! I wish that my willow tree is living well in a different place. What are you doing? What's that? It's disgusting!! I'll give it to you. Gerogero! What's this? Monkey's hand. It grants you 3 wishes. I made one wish so I have two more times... wishes. What should i wish? I dunno... To get a lot of girls? Hug them.... Idiot!! Kiritani Kotani-san Wait! Can I have your autograph? Hey! Don't you have something to say? You!! Don't be proud just 'cause you were able to read! Are you listening? Maybe she's not listening 'cause she's stupid! "Unless you change yourself..." "you're gonna be picked on for the rest of your life..." "You're seriously gonna be pulled out." Say something! Kiritani! Bando's going against Kotani again. Wow! Bando's so bored. I'm leaving. You're leaving? - Yeah. Ciao! - Ciao! Wait! Kotani, wait! Wait! Wait! What are you doing? You!! Shuji... help me. This world no matter how far I go Is just the same world A world I'm not supposed to live in. Forever just continuing on... Kotani, come back! Wait! Wait! Let go! What are you doing? Stop!! What are you doing? [bad girls not allowed] It feels like a different world. A world I made. Please!! The Principal's hair get less and less and in 3 years please he'll have none! Oh! Did you see? Here. I'm giving it to you. 2 more wishes left! You don't like the principal? I hate him. But it's work, so I have to see him. You have to say your wishes aloud. For me, losing hair isn't enough. I want worse things. People are free to think anything. I've killed so many people in my head. Our minds are useful that way. Without anything actually happening you can just think and change gears. Anyways, this works really well. Be careful on your wishes. Bando should... Bando should disappear from this world! It's the willow tree! This means my wish came true? Kotani? Kotani! Kotani get on! Just get on! What? The tree, it's still alive, they're planting it somewhere else! Come on, get on! This... Wow! Hold on! The willow tree must not have thought it would go across the ocean. Unless you live on, you don't know what's gonna happen. They exist, the places you can live renewed. Yeah. I... can I become a big tree? Yeah! One that no one can pull out? can I become one? You have to become one. Ohh! Here. There was a hole so... Please cancel my wish that Bando disappear from this world! I will live in this world where Bando exists. Dinner's ready! What's that dirty thing? This is a monkey's hand. It grants your wishes. No, really!! OK. World peace!! Now there's peace! Turn on the TV... is there news that there's peace? You must be joking! I'm being serious! There's one more wish left. So you can make a wish too. Me? Go ahead! Then... world peace wish from before... please cancel it! Hey!! I made the world at peace and... what are you doing? yeah, yeah... yeah. You might have been right the world might have been really peaceful for 3 seconds. You don't believe it?! Believe it! I believe it. By flow is really scary. For some reason it seemed that it was decided that i was gonna produce Nobuko. Secret. It's a secret. Secret!! Don't yell secret! Instead of calling her Nobuko... Shouldn't we give her a nickname? That's a good idea but... Your name's... Nobuko... Nobuko... Nobuko... Nobuko... Nobuko... Shut up! Nobuko... - Shut up!! Nobuta, not Nobuta... I think Nobuta's good! (buta= pig) Why? What's this? - Hey! Sometimes I wonder why am I yelling with them? And I reflect back... but this again is a game. So I gotta have fun... but, at the time, I didn't know at all... [die] that the future would hide something truly dark and deep. There would be a genuine evil, that we would have to fight, together. === *** Nobuta Fansubs **** == . . Translator: dancestar24 Editor: pokute Timer: mystery korean Timing Provider: tianj
