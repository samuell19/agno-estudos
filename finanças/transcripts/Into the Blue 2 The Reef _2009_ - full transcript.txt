Says he's very proud of himself. He was pursued by the Coast Guard. Says he was very cool, very smart, very careful not to dump the merchandise in deep water, but waited till they were over the reef and took great pains to make sure the cargo was not seen. - We have the coordinates. - That's nice. But here's the problem. I have a very important customer that has spent a very large sum of money for merchandise which I now cannot deliver on time. Dumping the cargo was not part of our contract. So, I'm thinking maybe you and I should renegotiate our deal. Good. Pay the man what I feel he's owed. - The others? - Already done. Get rid of the boat and the bodies. - Did you have fun today? - Yeah, I did. - Here you go. - Thank you. Mmm-hmm. You sure you don't wanna get dive certified while you're here? No, I'm sure. Sounds like too much work. I'm just here to relax. What exactly is it that you do in the real world? Actually, I'm a heart surgeon. Wow. I'm just kidding, I'm a model. Mostly print ads, couple of commercials. When I get a break, I just need some open space. - Well, we got plenty of that. - That's for sure. You know, Sebastian always says we don't make as much money as some people, but we've got one hell of an office. Of course, this is all just temporary. I mean, we've got bigger plans for down the road. Whatever the case, I think you guys have it pretty great out here. I mean, I look around and it's like heaven, just a wet little slice of heaven. Did you mean that out there today? What's that? Well, about all this being temporary. I don't know. I don't wanna be a dive bum forever, you know. Working other people's vacations. Well, what about the San Cristobal, huh? Hmm? San Cristobal. Other than this, it's been four years of nothing but sand. Well, you have to admit, you've got a sexy boss. Right? True. And the dress code is liberal. That's true. And the health benefits are pretty good. I feel like I'm being sexually harassed. True. Maybe I'll stay on for one more year. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up! - Were you sleeping? - Yeah. - Mace? - Yeah. Long night? Yes, Dad, yes. - All night. - Where's Kimi? Sleeping- - What'd Kimi say? - Kimi. Kimi didn't say much of anything. Kimi is, uh, still sleeping. What are you gonna tell her? We are going to tell her that I slept on the couch. And being the nice and kind and thoughtful person I am, didn't wanna disturb her and got an early start. Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - And what really happened? - Nothing happened. Technically, nothing happened. Then you got nothing to worry about, do you? Now, if you have to know, I was at the bar last night. I was having a few beers and I was waiting for Kimi. I'm minding my own business, okay? Couple of the girls that I took surfing this weekend came... Here we go, here we go. Hey, in my line of work, you have to be polite and nice to the client. And I'm telling you, nothing happened. So, anyway, one of these girls, she asked me if I wanted to dance. And what was I gonna say? Was I gonna say no? Could have, yeah. "No" falls within even your vocabulary. Well, I did not say no because I am a gentleman, okay? So, anyway, I'm out on the dance floor with this girl. We've got our drinks. it's hot in there. - My shirt's opened up. - Why wouldn't it be? This guy knocks my elbow, I wind up spilling my drink all down my chest, and this Parvati girl, she just starts licking it, licking it off of my chest, right there in the middle of the dance floor. - I hate it when that happens. - Hate it when that happens. - And then, perfect timing. Ha! - Kimi walked in? Exactly! Kimi walks in. And there you are, with some girl's tongue caressing your manly pecs. So what did Kimi do? Well, that's just the thing. I mean, Kimi, she didn't do anything. She came and she saw. She didn't say anything, she didn't do anything. She just... She sat there and looked and... Then why is this freaking you out? What do you mean, why is that freaking me out? Are we talking about the same Kimi right now? Little crazy Kimi? She's wily. I bet she's in there dreaming up a storm of ways to get back at me, I... No. - Dani, yes, Dani, Dani... - No, Mace. Mace, not again, no. You are her best friend. Please talk to her. Please. I am... I'm begging you. I am getting down on my knees and throwing myself at your mercy. Pretty please with whipped cream and a cherry on top. Please talk to her. Please! Fine. Whatever. - That's a yes. - Last time. That's a... Last time. You are an angel. I owe you one. - One? - Yeah, yeah. One, whatever. You know, I gotta go. You just let me know. Just so you know, lever catch some girl licking rum off your chest... - What are you gonna do? - Nothing. - 'Cause it would never happen. - You know me so well. Are you Sebastian? Yes, I am. I'm Carlton. This is Azra. - Hello, this is Dani. - Hello. What can I do for you guys? Well, I'm told you're the man to talk to if we want to dive the North Reef. We were looking to hire someone privately for the week. A week? - Uh, let me see. - We'll have to, uh... We might have to rearrange some stuff. Yeah, let me flip through the schedule here. You usually have to book a little further in advance. Yeah, we could do a week. What kind of diving you looking to do? - Reef diving? Wall diving? - Perhaps a bit of both. The truth is, I'm looking for something. The San Cristobal. - You've heard of it. - Heard of it? He's practically obsessed with it. We've been poking around in the sand, looking for that for four years. There's nothing down there. Maybe you've been looking in the wrong place. - Or maybe it's just a legend. - Oh, no, it's more than a legend, sir. The San Cristobal was one of the largest ships of its age. - Over 2,000 tons and... - I know the story. Left Acapulco in 1623, headed to the Philippines. She sank with a huge cargo of ivory, jewels, Spanish doubloons. Just like this one. Sebastian found it about a year ago off the North Reef. Well, clearly my information was correct. - You are the man to see. You're hired. - Okay. What do you think it is? We won't know till we get it in a solution and dissolve all the crud off. But it could be... I don't know, part of a sword or scepter. - You think it's from San Cristobal? - Doubtful. Well, whatever it is, hopefully we can use it. We wanna furnish our Someday Boat with things entirely from under the sea. Your "Someday Boat"? I'm impressed. You've got it down to the bolts and the wiring, haven't you? Now, these revolved sections, they're hand-drawn, aren't they? - You know design? - I took a few courses in my day, yeah. But this, this is goddamn beautiful. - You really did this all yourself? - Every inch. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to make boats. I worked for some yacht maker on the mainland, but it didn't take me long to realize I didn't wanna spend the rest of my life making someone else's dreams. That's what it's all about, isn't it? Having a dream and chasing it any way you can? I guess. it gets hard sometimes, though, you know? I mean, this is a great gig, but none of it's ours. This equipment, it's all leased. We're in it up to here. But we have the dream, right? The San Cristobal? Sure, that's one way. I wouldn't rule out any others. No, of course not. So, Azra and I were wondering what you two were doing for dinner tonight. Well, we can do whatever you want. What are you in the mood for? We've rented a little house up the road. Why don't you just come up there? Our chef will cook. Their chef. - Do I look okay? - You look great, babe. I know what I want for Christmas. Beautiful view! - Hello. - Welcome. Hi, how are you? This is amazing. - Hello. - Hi. - You look lovely. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you. - Oh. - Vodka? - Water. Azra doesn't drink. it's a control thing. Well, we'll make up for that. Call me crazy, but this doesn't suck. I'm glad you like it. That wine is unbelievable. It's like drinking velvet. That is a Chateau Lafite Rothschild, 1981. Carlton fancies himself as a bit of a wine connoisseur. - Well, my compliments. - Thank you. So, while you guys are here, did you wanna do any night diving? - No. - Good. I take it you don't like diving at night. - Well... - She hates it. I love the ocean. The ocean at night? No, thank you. I know it's, you know, strange. I just... I couldn't agree with you more. I'd like to be able to see whatever might want to kill me. And you, Sebastian? Do you enjoy it? - Night diving? Yeah, I do. - It doesn't scare you? There's nothing wrong with fear, right? Fear can keep you alive, especially underwater. Hmm. Well... Here is to fear. To fear. Can you believe this? What's the matter, Captain? You don't like guns on board? No, I don't. Sebastian doesn't talk about it, but, um, about a year ago, he was out with one of his buddies, Mace, not far from here, and they found a family... floating. Mother, father, two kids. They'd been shot to death. - I'm sorry. I had no idea. - It's not your fault. Still, I'm no fan of guns, myself. Hey! What are you doing, dude? It's almost 5:00. You better hurry up! We were out diving. So, you guys coming with us? You should definitely come with us. - Yeah. - Come where? The Barbecue, Beer and Kill Fest. That's awful. - You sure you don't wanna play? - Oh, no thanks. I need a better reason to sweat. - All righty. - Okay. So what do you want to do, two on two? Um, I thought maybe four on... Holy shit! Guess who just showed up. The chest-licker. - Who? - Parvati. I got an idea. Hey, anyone got next game? - You guys. - Great, be right there. Hey, baby, wish us luck. - Kimi, you're the worst. - Good luck. Let's brutalize them. Hello. Mine! Here we go! Come on, baby. - Get some, Mace. - I got more where that came from. - That's cute. - Bitch! What do you say we put some skin in the game? We come back and beat you, you cough up something good. - Like what? - Your board. And if we continue to kick your butts? Another surf lesson with Romeo, on me. You're on. Get it! Yeah! Boom! - Boo-ya! - Yeah, baby! Whoo! Yeah! Game point, suckers! Suck it! - Yeah! Survive that, biotch. - All right! I'll send Romeo over tomorrow to pick up the board. Go! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Damn! - Hey, hey, what's the matter? Game point, asshole. We serve. Damn! - Whoo! - Yeah! Yeah! Boom, baby! Who's the loudmouth? That's Avery, another dive master. He's our main competition. Mace is a punk. I actually feel sorry for that dude. People laugh at that jack-off, and he doesn't even know it. Plus, his girlfriend wants my knob. Seriously, dude, I'd take that chick back to my boat, give her one good bone-diving lesson, she'd be done with that chump. It sounds like you have a busy afternoon coming up. Kelsey, hey. I didn't realize you expanded your business. Are you a certified bone-diving instructor now? Come on, I'm just messing around. You think you're some kind of player? You think you've got game? I mean, "bone-diving lessons," really? Am I dating a sixth-grader? - Well... - Don't even think about interrupting me. I'm about 30 seconds away from ripping your balls off. And don't you ever let me catch you talking or looking at another woman because I swear, not only will I be done with you, everyone will be. A registered sex offender will have an easier time getting laid on this island. Get it? - Yes. - You really get it? Yes! I get it! No need to make a scene. Every other day it's like that. In Fiji, the water is crystal clear. It's blue for miles, even at 100 feet. It's one of our favorite places. How long have you and Azra been together? We've known each other for seven years. Met at Oxford. Discovered we both love diving, just been traveling the world. - That must be nice. - As you say, it doesn't suck. Well, don't be surprised if you find me crammed into your luggage - when you leave here. - I wouldn't be. Nice work. Heard through the coconut wireless you might have found something. - I'm Avery. - Carlton. - No, we didn't find shit. - Yeah, shocker. The wet T-shirt contest now begins. I hear my name being called. You ever wanna get serious about finding something, look me up. Nice suit. He seems like a nice guy. - For a prick? - Yeah. Yeah, look at that jiggle! Check it! Aw, wanna get some! Let's get another water over here. Uh! Take that. Blam, blam. Oh, Lord! Yeah! Yeah! Baby. - Do I look blond to you? - What? Or do you think I'm blind? I just saw you get a lap dance from Miss Wet-n-Wild over there. I don't even like her. I didn't do anything. Yeah, that's the problem. I've got to get better at that. Back to where I was. Men are like dogs, and Mace is like a little puppy. And if he really did do anything wrong, he'd probably feel so guilty, he'd pee on the floor. So you really aren't mad at him? No, but don't tell him, 'cause I love it when he's like this. He gets so obedient. - Hey, what's so funny over here? - Uh, nothing, just girl talk. That's cool. My friends and I are having a little party later on. Why don't you come on by? You know what? We're here with our boyfriends. - Yeah. - So... Whoa, wait. She said we have to go. You are my new hero. So, after we dissolved the sediment from our find, here's what we got. It's a Caravaca Cross carried by the priests of the time. Now, apparently, there were chips of wood from Christ's cross within each one of them that gives it powers, kind of like an amulet. And the priests were on the boats, not just for the spread of Christianity but also for good luck because they were attacked so frequently. It's part of the ship's manifest. This is the first thing we have found that could definitely have been on the San Cristobal, - so we need to go back exactly... - No. We're not going to do that. You don't understand. There's a very specific area right here, where we were diving. - The undercurrents... - I said no. All right, I'm confused. You specifically said when you hired us that you were searching for the... San Cristobal. Yes, I know. I think we should tell them. Tell us what? Some associates of mine connected with the US government were in Iraq, and they discovered quite a sizable portion of Saddam Hussein's hidden fortune in the form of cash money, gold and jewelry. How sizable? - Upwards of 60 million dollars. - Jesus. Yeah, now, they could have reported their findings - to the proper authorities, but... - But they didn't. No, they came to me. Why you? Because Carlton is known to have a certain expertise in moving goods in and out of places. He's a smuggler, you mean. No, I like to think of myself as an importer/exporter. Smuggler sounds so low-rent. These officers managed to get the merchandise as far as Hong Kong, after which they hired Carlton to bring it into the States. First stop was Honolulu, but while they were coming in, they got into some trouble with the Coast Guard. - The men he hired panicked. - And they threw our containers overboard. Somewhere out by the North Reef. So that's what you're really looking for? The two containers, yes. And if you help us find those containers... - What are we paying you again? - Five hundred a day. Thirty-five hundred a week. Tell you what. You help us find those containers, and we will up your fee to $500,000. $500,000? - Is this a joke? - No, sir. What's really in those containers? You think it's drugs, don't you? Thought had crossed my mind, yeah. It isn't drugs. I promise you. Tell them the rest of it. You owe them the truth. Okay, look. The $500,000 isn't just for services rendered, it's also an apology. The men who hired Carlton, they're rather serious individuals. They made it quite clear that if he didn't find their merchandise within the week, or if someone should find it before him, - then they... - Then I will die. They will kill me. It's as plain and as simple as that. Except it's not so plain, nor so simple, is it? No, it's not. Look, these men, they know your names. They know who you are. They know you've been helping me. - So, we're in danger, too? - Only if we don't find those containers. Yo, scuba stud. Got a complaint in my office this morning. A guy at the club got a little roughed up. Yeah, where were you? Too busy busting underage girls? Very funny. Anything I need to worry about? No, some guy was harassing one of my clients, and she took care of it. Yeah, I heard. Heard all about it. You guys doing some diving? - That's right. - Yeah? What kind? Underwater, mostly. Sure you're not out there looking for something? Okay, now you're harassing my clients. - I'm just doing my job. - Really? What's the occasion? Look, Officer, maybe there's a misunderstanding. I'm just doing some sport diving with a friend, and Sebastian's guiding us. Who's guiding him? Sorry? I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. Actually, he's the best dive master on the island, aren't you? I just like to give him a hard time. You're an ass, you know that, Yorkin? - Yes, I do. All right, you guys. - Dani! Get out of here, good luck. Hey, Dani. Hey, Paul. Clear! - What's that? - Sounds like an SOS. Dani Girl, Dani Girl. Over. This is the Dani Girl, what's the problem? Over. Did not copy, please repeat. Be advised, be advised. I've got Icy Hot all over my balls and it feels good. Over. I repeat, Icy Hat on the balls, it feels good. - Would you like some, dude? - It's not a toy. What was that about? - Just Avery being an asshole. - What's he doing here? He's our main competition. I told you. Hey, yo, Sebastian, you want that Icy Hot? Competition isn't something we can have right now. Get rid of him. I wish I could. It doesn't exactly work that way. Let me put it this way. Dipshit over there finds the containers before we do, guess who's retiring early and buying the nicest new yacht on the island, and guess who's not. If we chase him off, he'll know we're onto something. We'll have Avery and half the other divers out here by the afternoon. Yeah, you don't want that. Look, he knows I have a thing for the San Cristobal, all right? He mocks me for it. Let him keep mocking me. Let him think I'm taking you on the usual wild goose chase. That's how you get rid of him, do nothing. It's not that bad if you put it on before you shave. - It gets rubbed in a little bit. - All right. You don't get that chafed feeling, you know, that you got the other day. You should try it out. You want to try this out? No. Stay on your boat, pal. I'll be over here. One down, one to go. We're halfway home. So, what do you want to do with this one? We could go back and get some equipment, bring it up. No, I think it's fine right where it is. We'll find the other one, then we'll bring them both up together. Not to bust anyone's bubble, but the second one might be harder to find. Why is that? You saw where this one was, right on the edge of the reef. - If it's off the reef... - Got to dive deeper, less time underwater, cover less ground. No matter, as long as we find it. We need both containers. Whatever you say. But if we have to dive over the reef, we have to refill these tanks, and it's almost 2:00 now. We should get a fresh start tomorrow. Very well. Well, then, you're coming to our house. Milos will cook one of his usual feasts, and we'll stay relaxed and stay focused. No, you know what, uh, we'd love to, but we promised Mace and Kimi we'd go to dinner tonight. Oh, no problem. They can come, too. Perfect. Mace, you are a total ass! What about those messages from Parvati, huh? Jesus, Kimi! Are you even listening to yourself, because you're not making any sense. - My sense? I'm not making sense? - I don't know what it is that you want from me. You wanna figure stuff out, figure it out, because I'm frigging out of here. - Oh, fine, leave! - Jesus Christ! What are you looking at, old man? I hate you. I hate... - Kimi, what's wrong? - Well, I'm just packing his stuff! I am pissed, okay? If he wants to leave, fine, but I am not taking him back. - I'll be... - Yeah. This is all his stuff! He loves to read, so he can take it with him. - Okay, what happened? - What happened? What happened? Um, let's see. Text messages at 1:00 in the morning, okay? Him flirting... I have been with him for four years. Four years, and... I'm tired. Oh, I'm tired. I, uh... - I put on a good face. - I know. But I don't know how long I can do this. I mean, I don't need much, but... I need something. Listen to me, Mace loves you. - Okay? - Yeah, I'm not so sure. It's time to move on. We should talk. Let me guess. it's about Kimi, right? No thanks, bro. Kind of all talked out on that subject. What did you do this time? What did I do? Thank you. Thank you, friend, for immediately jumping to the conclusion that it's something that I did. You know, just so you know, this was totally not my fault, all right? - Whose fault was it? - Parvati's fault. You know, she texted me yesterday, asking me when I was gonna come pick up some surfboard that Kimi won, and... I don't know, you know, "Oh, so good to see you at the beach," all this stuff. Yeah, you know, she might have written a couple of things that, if you read them out of context, they could have been misunderstood. - A lot of that going around. - Yeah, well, I'm a misunderstood guy. You know, I... I don't know, I flirt. I like flirting, so what? You know, it's no big deal. Maybe she's getting fed up with it. Maybe it has to do with the fact that for some crazy reason, she actually loves you. Yeah, well, she's got a funny way of showing that. You know what? She's gonna have to learn how to get along without me, because I am done with her, and for real this time. I am never going back to that woman. You drive me crazy! You drive me crazy, honey. I love you. Milos. Milos, my man. Dinner was outstanding, my compliments. Mmm-hmm. Okay. What's the matter with the big guy? He, uh, no comprenda the ingles? Oh, he understands it. He just doesn't like to speak it. Oh. That's all right, as long as he can cook like that, right? I mean, lobster was so damn good, it almost made me believe in God. - Ha. - And you don't? - What, believe in God? - Uh-huh. Well, I believe in the body, the ocean, the wind and the sun. Vodka, beer, tequila and rum. Here, here! And I believe in love. So what do you believe in, Carlton? Not much, really. - And you? - Me? Azra believes in vengeance. Okay. And I believe it's time for us to go. - Time to go? - What? What happened to dive all day and drink all night? Dani's right, we came here to dive. We should get an early start tomorrow. Well, uh... I guess that just leaves you and me. How about it, little lady? You want to party with me? - Twist it. - Oh, that's my girl. Let's go. Come on, back into the water. - Back into the water. - Bye, guys. - Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks again. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - See you in the morning. See you in the morning. I don't like those people, I don't trust them and I don't want their goddamn money. You know, and I don't like the way you've been acting with Carlton. All buddy-buddy. - He's sleazy! - He's European. - I want out. - Hey, Dani, Dani, Dani. All right. Listen to me, okay? You've known me a long time. You've known me longer than anybody else. You know that I have always had this picture in my head of what I want my life to be, okay? And you've always been there for me and you've always supported me, and here we are... We have a chance to make it happen. I want that life, Dani. I want that boat. You don't get it. I'm happy as long as we're together. I love you. I'll go. What? Tonight, we'll go look. Sebastian, I'm... I'm not diving at night. You don't have to, all right? We'll go out there, I'll go down and I'll take a look at what it is. If there's anything fishy, we will bail faster than you can blink. I promise. But if it's what they say, we'll make like we were never there and we'll get our $500,000. What are you doing? I can't let you go alone. You sure? Let's just do this. I take it from your expressions you opened the container, saw what's inside. - You were right. - I know. What you found was just the casing. The warhead is in container number two. That's right. Just your everyday, average, low-grade nuke. Separately, the pieces are somewhat dangerous but mostly useless. But combining them, turning them into a weapon. That's a whole other skill possessed by a very rare group of people around the world. I told you I took some design courses. Look, we'll bring up the containers. You can keep your money and just go. Go? Oh, no. We're not going anywhere. Azra has quite a penchant for Hawaii. Pearl Harbor part two, coming soon to a newscast. Oh, my God. But first, we have to find the second container. We will take you up on your kind offer of help. You're crazy. Maybe, but if you'd like to save yourself from a great deal of prolonged pain and begging, after which I'll only be answering your prayers by killing you both... She's quite an expert at that. She was trained by the best. ...you will do exactly as we say. I love you. Dani, no! She can't hold her breath forever. I know what you're thinking. You're trying not to panic. But you're wondering, "Is that it? Is that the last time I'll ever see her?" You're asking yourself how this moment could be real. You're good people, you never asked for any of this. Where I come from, good people die every day. Simple, hard-working, God-fearing people who never asked for their lives to be changed either. But every day there's another family who just happens to live on the wrong street, next to the wrong house, and a decision gets made by someone far away. And they push a button, and a bomb falls and misses its target, and it hits their house and their family, and their lives get blown to pieces. Not soldiers, not terrorists, just people. Gone. If you live, you wish you'd died. That's it. She's gone. Get up. In there. Mace? Mace? As quietly as you can, I want you to get up and get dressed. You try anything and she dies. You'll be a good boy now, won't you? Not too tight, just tight enough. This is only a means to an end. Just so you know, Milos has an almost pathological hatred for the USA, so don't give him a reason to work out his aggression. Especially on Miss America, there. Hey, don't look at me. This isn't my war. I only go to the highest bidder for services rendered. Oh, and sorry about your girlfriend. She was quite special, wasn't she? Sleep tight. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Good luck, Sebastian. Hey, you. Rise and shine. Now, you guys behave yourselves today, or Azra has promised to make both of you watch young Kimberly here be flensed to the bone. By the way, it is a beautiful day for diving. Jacques Cousteau wishes he were alive. - It's looking good, right? - Yeah, looks fine. Honolulu Group, Honolulu Group, mayday, mayday. Pa 'a Ono. Pa 'a Ono. Honolulu Group, Honolulu Group. Mayday, mayday. Mayday, mayday. We have a young woman an marker buoy 12295. She seems to be barely conscious. She's shivering up a storm, please advise. Copy that, Rescue team will rendezvous with you at the buoy. Roger that. There's been a change of plan. Let's go. She's suffering from severe hypothermia. Dani's a very strong young woman. A lucky one, as well. If last night had been a degree or two colder, I'm not sure she would have made it. - She's gonna be okay, though? - She should be, yes. We'll know more, of course, after she wakes up. - When will that be? - Hard to say, she's in shock. Once her body temperature comes up and she's hydrated, within 24 hours. Thank you, Doctor. You hang in there, okay? Hang in there. I was wondering when you'd show up. Hey, how are you? Um, this is Azra. - Nice to finally meet you. - Same. So, I gotta ask, what the hell was she doing out there, a mile off shore? No boat. No boyfriend. Yeah, I know. Um... We got into a fight. She got a text message from some guy, and I got jealous and started yelling at her, and next thing I know, she's running out the door. I guess she must have gone night diving. - Dani? - Yeah, I know. - Where's the boat? - Hmm? Well, if she went night diving, the boat that got her out there... Nothing else has washed up except for her. And I know she didn't swim that far. Yeah, I don't know. That's it? I don't know. I'm as in the dark about this as you are, okay? And I feel like I'm the one who put her here, so I wanna answer your questions, but I can't. Maybe the stud muffin who was texting her can help you out. You know, it's been a rough morning. Dani's a good girl. Yeah. I hate to see her like this. I'm gonna leave you guys alone, okay? If you think of anything at all, let me know. All right? You all right? Yeah? Okay. Take care, hmm? A simple "I don't know" would have done. Look, he's a close friend of mine. He would have known I was bullshitting if I didn't have a story for him. Fine. You'll go back to the boat. I'll stay here. If Dani wakes up, I'll make very clear to her how important her silence is. It takes five minutes to get to the boat. You've got three. If you divert in any way, Dani will die. - Three minutes. - We're ready. You can't have cell phones in the room. - Excuse me? - You'll have to take it outside. - Any sign? - No. I'll prepare to cast off. Carlton! I'm here! I'm here! Everything's a go. Call me when you have the containers. Right. We found the second container, we just came up for more equipment. Right, right. I don't believe this shit is happening right now. Just tell me that this is a bad dream. I'm afraid not. No. No, see, you don't get to say that. You are supposed to say something heroic. You're supposed to say something positive, because right now, things are looking pretty fucking negative. Okay? And I don't know what to do. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Do what you do best. Fuck things up. I think it's time we had ourselves a little chat. Hey, listen, dude, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened down there. I do. You fucked up. And I can't let that happen again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, look... Look, this is difficult, okay? Just give us another chance. We won't mess it up, I swear. I know you won't. What the fuck? She didn't fucking do anything. Let's try again. Correctly, this time. What do you mean, you had to kill her? I've got it covered. I'm going down with Sebastian. Milos will take care of the other one. In the meantime, make it very, very clear to our dive master that I'm holding his girlfriend's life in the palm of my hand. If he does what we want, everyone lives. - Shit. - What? Shit. We 're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. All right, ladies and gentlemen, right this way. Come on in, this way. - You'll get it back. - Hey! Hey, that's my phone. Avery! Avery! What's up, Captain America? Found Dani unconscious off a marker buoy this morning. I heard that. Why you talking to me? The name of your boat came up in a conversation. He's gonna kill us. You know that, don't you? The second we bring up those containers, we're dead. If this is your idea of a pep talk, it's not working, all right? Mace... Grip it and rip it. Hurry it up. I wanna get back down there. Back the fuck up, you ape! Back the fuck up! Ma 'am, this is police dispatch. We 're connecting you with Detective Yorkin. Okay. Paul, it's Dani. I'm in trouble, I need your help. We're at the pier. Get the fuck out of my way! Put the fucking gun down before you hurt yourself. You shut your fucking mouth, you asshole. - Finish him. - Fuck! Shit. - Paul, help me! - It's all right. Come on. - Azra's trying to kill me. - It's all right. Come on, it's all right. - Let's go. Sebastian. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. - It's all right. - We're on our way, we're on our way. - Go, go, go. Come on. Really? You don't have to do this, you know. I have access to a lot of money, more than I know what to do with. I'll give you one million dollars just to walk away. Two million dollars. Okay. Okay. I've insulted you with those low figures, huh? I can give you more. Three million. Think about that. You can do anything with that kind of money, go anywhere. Buy your Someday Boat. You and Dani can just sail away. Put the gun down, Sebastian. Don't do this. You're not a murderer. No. You are. Help! Help! I can't... ...swim! Everything's off. How much time do we have? Very little, I think. I'll get the car. I should have guessed. You're even better than I was told. You know my name. Is there a deal to be made here? We're in the middle of a war. I know which side I'm on. I'm not so sure about you. I'm sorry, if things had only gone differently, - I could have... - Well, they didn't. And now I have to disappear again. Who else knows about this, about me? No one. Just me and Felix. That might be the first thing you've gotten right. So did we get the salvage rights? Sebastian, it's not supposed to take this long. Just be patient, it'll happen. I'm not so sure. Something always happens. Where are you? Just keep an walking down to the beach. I'm on the beach. I still don't see you. Holy shit. We got the rights, baby!
