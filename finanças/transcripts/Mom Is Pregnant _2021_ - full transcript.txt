What's up so early, Yasmeen? You're useless! I've been at it all morning and you're still asleep. - I'm getting up now. - Hurry. Our appointment's in two hours. And wear a suit. We're going to meet a minister. Got it? Because I come to work in boxers? - Go on, hang up so I can get ready. - Look. - Which logo is better? - The yellow one, of course. I think the red is better for the campaign. It's more catchy. It's catchy because you designed it. I say the yellow one I designed is better. We'll show them both logos and they can choose. They'll choose the yellow one, of course. You know why? Because you're black inside. Go on now, hang up. I'm looking for the suit under the pillow. Hang up! This is worth a "Good morning." What does she want at this time? We were together all night. Morning, baby. What's this? Why are you smoking so early? It's bad for your health, babe. And you're drinking hibiscus? - Why don't you come over? - No, I have a big meeting. Call you later. Okay, let that help you. I'll pray for you. You, of all people, shouldn't pray for me. No, no. I can't believe it! This is unbelievable. What will I do now? Is your husband crazy? What do you mean "he insists"? What should I do, Ms. Somia? He said I can't work if I'm pregnant. He worries. Like you haven't already had three children? He really wants a boy. He has high hopes this time. So, he told me I have to rest. I'll be back to work as soon as I give birth. May God help us with the delivery expenses. Don't worry, Saeeda. I'll give you 3000 EGP on top of your salary. 3000 EGP? Fine. It's obvious you don't like that. It's all good from your hands. But you know how expensive life is now. Why don't you tell that to your husband instead of churning out kids! All right. Come by the studio. I'll give you another 5000 EGP, okay? May God bless your home! And may your boys marry and have children all over. I hope so, Saeeda. I hope so. - Good morning, Dr. Asim. - Yes, Mr. Effat? - I'm afraid it didn't happen. - Still? You have to find me a solution for this. What more can I do, Mr. Effat? I told you, trotters and mussel juice for breakfast. What about work? I look really bad. - You've looked bad since the engagement. - What are you saying, Doctor? I'm saying I'm going to the hospital now. We can talk there. Goodbye. - Good morning, darling. - Good morning, sweetheart. Coffee. Quick. Why didn't you wake me up? You looked tired. I thought I'd leave you. - I'm most miserable when I'm asleep. - Why, my love? Because I can't see you when I'm asleep. My eyes are deprived of your beauty. What beauty, Kamel? That was long ago. - You'll be beautiful to me until I die. - God forbid. Don't say that. It's very early. - Good morning. - Good morning, my love. Hello, Doctor. - Saeeda. - Yes. - Did you feed Bucci? Get me coffee. - Yes, earlier. Okay. And I want tea, Saeeda. - Good morning, guys. - Good morning. Good morning, Bucci. I have something important to say. Unfortunately, it's Saeeda's last day. - Why? - She's pregnant and her husband's worried. How? Didn't she give birth last month? Is Saeeda a rabbit? What will we do? I'll look after the house, but you guys have to help me. - Each one is responsible for their room. - No, I certainly don't agree. These beautiful hands will wash dishes and cook and clean? - Something wrong? - No, just, the egg's raw. If I agreed to that, what will you do about work? I'll juggle both. There's no other way. There's an easier way. We get someone else until she returns. No, no, no. I can't handle teaching and monitoring someone. Did you forget how many thefts we've had? I know Saeeda's greedy, but she's honest. I'll get Idrees from work in the meantime. Idrees? No, Idrees won't do. He's very old. - We want someone mobile like Saeeda. - Right. Asim is right. Oh, really? Why don't you guys get married and get your wives to serve you instead? Here comes that useless conversation. What do you mean, useless? Listen up. I really don't like our way of life at all. The house has become a hotel. You just come to eat and sleep. We don't sit together. Where have our nice gatherings gone? Mom, this is no time for nostalgia. - I have work. - I have an important meeting. Wait, Asim. Aunt Manal called to have lunch with her. You want me for her daughter Faten, right? Who is still called Faten these days? The last one called Faten was Faten Ha mama and they even teased that name back then. - Mom, I'm not getting married. - Calm down, Asim. Who are you to talk? You have an old-fashioned name too. - They'll drive me crazy. - Don't be upset. They don't wanna get married. Fools! Is there anything better than marriage? Have a seat, Mr. Effat. What's going on, Doctor? What's wrong with Effat? I've told you a hundred times, Ms. Nagwa. There's nothing wrong with Mr. Effat. - So, what's going on, Doctor? - The issue is a matter of depletion. - What do you mean? I don't get it. - I'll explain. Does a car with 340,000 km mileage perform the same as one with 10,000 km? Are we at the doctor's or the mechanic's? What performance anyway? There is no performance. Does he not get angry? Have you tried swearing at him? Some men like that. - I tell you what. - Yeah? I watch adverts for stimulants and steroids all day. Why don't you find us a strong stimulant? Why? This right here could straighten the Leaning Tower of Pisa. What do you mean? I don't get it. You need a disguise. Have you seen Nour El-Sherif's film Monster Run where he needed a tiny grain? You're just the same. But you don't need a tiny grain. You need something bigger. If there's no donor, we'll have to try alternative medicine. Go to the spice shop and get some ginseng, some pine and a jar of mountain honey. Mountain honey is outstanding. Still won't work? Forget mountain honey. Get mountain bees and giant ants. Grind them and put them in a cup. And enjoy. - Here you go. - Thank you, Doctor. - Hopefully, we'll get some good news soon. - God willing. Awad! - What's wrong, Doctor? - Go to Dr. Mervat. Tell her to keep it down because Dr. Asim can't work! The ideas I've heard from you are great. What do you think? Yes, Honorable Minister. Very innovative. We promise that my... I mean, our company... Will organize the most unique campaign for the ministry. We must start the campaign right away. Of course, Honorable Minister. We have reached 104 million so far. People don't appreciate responsibility. So, our campaign has to be very effective. Of course, we understand that very well. We have many ideas we can present to you. We'll start with the ideas you suggested, then we can see the new ones you have. I want to say something very important. I much prefer the red logo to the yellow. - Yes, the red one is my design. - Your design? I like this dynamic duo and enthusiasm and shoulder bumps going on. We're partners and university buddies. And he's my cousin. So, work and relatives? Bravo. Bassem. Do you know Dr. Asim Kamel Bahnasy? - It depends. - Excuse me? - He's my brother. Did he do something? - I'm very proud of Dr. Asim. He's done important research into male contraceptives. Of course. I have personally tried it. - You've tried Dr. Asim? - No. Dr. Asim's research. - I've always told Asim he'd be a genius. - Asim is also my cousin. Of course. If Bassem's your cousin, then Asim is also your cousin. Excuse her. She's only smart at work. Excuse me. I have a very important call. Hello? What? Take her to hospital. I'm coming! - What's going on, Nagib? - My wife's giving birth and it's critical. - What's wrong? - It's our sixth child. - Sixth? - I hope she feels better, Mr. Nagib. Excuse me. Sixth? Is he the campaign supervisor? Kamel, sir. What's up, Hind? I have suppliers' checks for you to sign. What's this? - What day of the month is it? - April 10th, sir. These are some of the designs I finished. I want you to execute them immediately while I finish the remainder. - Hello. - Hi, darling. I am very, very, very sorry. For what, my love? Our anniversary. Happy Anniversary. You're my love every year. All the work made me forget. But it's not until tomorrow. Do you remember we'd celebrate it eight months a year? That was a long time ago. We're older now. I'm old, but you'll always be Cinderella. I'll pick you up and we'll go for lunch. I have a lot of work. Have you forgotten the Dubai show? The Dubai show isn't for a long time. The show's very important to me. I have to prepare for it now already. Tell me. Me or Dubai show? Dubai show. - Hello, Chief. - Hello, Doctor. I've come all the way from Upper Egypt because of the stories I've heard about you. - What's your complaint? - No, Doctor. In the village, men don't complain. Not even about death. What do you think, ladies? Say something. Yes, Doctor. This chief is ten out of ten. Ten out of ten? Say twenty out of ten. Thirty out of ten. Forty out of ten, Doctor. Enough exaggeration! The results say Chief is two out of ten. That's not the problem, Doctor. - There's something worse? - I've had nine girls from these ladies. I want a boy. Girls? Then what are these ladies? Extras? I've developed such a complex now. I'm calling the girls boys' names. I didn't name any of them Caroline. I want a boy! We'll need to run some tests, Chief. Can I have a word on the side? - Here you go. - What's this, Doctor? - It's a gift from the clinic. - What should I do with it? You'll go and… What? What you're saying is rude and forbidden. It's not rude, it's for the tests. For you to have a boy. Yeah, but this is very small. Okay, take this. Here's another one. The bathroom is left, at the end. He has nine children and still wants more. Strange people. Throwing them into a world of deceit and hypocrisy. How do people think… - Awad? - Yes, Doctor! Didn't I tell you to tell Dr. Mervat that I can't work with this noise? I told her, Doctor. - Easy does it. - Don't be scared, my love. - You won't feel it. - Boy! What's wrong, Doctor? Oh, my goodness! You saw the boogeyman? You saw Mina the Ghoul? Do you want to see them? Then stop crying and shut up! - Doctor! - Yes? - Let the boy go! - Okay! Oh, my goodness! The boy! I'm sorry. Doctor! - I'm talking to you. Hey! - Yes? What did you just do in there? - Just threatening the boy. - Is that how one quiets kids? It's the result that counts. Isn't the boy quiet now? Quiet? The boy's paralyzed. You terrified him! - This behavior won't do, Doctor! - Do you think this circus will do? I'm a pediatrician! It's normal that kids cry when being vaccinated! You want them to sing and dance instead? Then don't vaccinate them. No, no, no. This is too much. It won't do. Let's start with the fathers. They don't know what to do with their kids. This will be very effective. No, the mother who passes out from serving her kids will be more effective. No. The father's spot will be more effective. Don't argue. The minister chose my red logo that you didn't like. - Hi. How are you, Yasso? - How are you, Haidy? - You look beautiful, baby. - Aren't we gonna keep working? We will. Nice. The father's spot at the start will be great. We must do a kids' casting immediately. Decide what you want to do and implement it immediately. - Are you gonna stare at us? Go. - I'm gonna go do my work. Baby, I've missed you. Where are we going tonight? Tell me first, how did the meeting go? - You got the campaign? - Of course. Bassem. I'll be the face of this campaign. Baby, it's a campaign for birth control. You being in it will motivate births. Who'd believe we've been together so long? A year with you, Simsim, is like a minute. My love, may I always have you. Here's your present, since you insist that we celebrate today. You're my present. Besides, we still haven't celebrated. I'll only open it tomorrow. I booked us a suite for three nights, as usual, so we can be alone. I love you so much. Do you ever stop? Stop booking suites or us being alone? Kamel, I really miss us all being together. Why don't you call Bassem and Asim? Let's have them join us for lunch. - Why now? - We don't spend time together. Kamel, I miss the Dokki flat. It was tiny and brought us together. You player. Let's finish eating, then go to the flat. There's no hope with you. Will you never stop doing this? Kamel, I really want the boys to get married. What will we do, Simsim? No matter what we say, one likes being single and the other's living the role of the brokenhearted. It's not like they're a great catch. I feel sorry for him. Can you imagine his fiancée cheating on him with his best friend? - That's really tough. - It's not tough at all. It's been two years. He's being dramatic. It was an experience. We have to push those boys to marry. What boys, Simsim? They're men. Don't you want to be a granddad? - You think I just want to be a granddad? - What, then? I want them to marry and leave home so we can frolic as we please. Can you not frolic as you please? I brought you here because what happened yesterday was wrong. Dr. Farid, I was coming to you anyway because you're the hospital manager. What Dr. Asim did was completely wrong. Why? Did I come to work in my pajamas? Doctor, I just want to work in peace. Okay, then it's simple. Move to Katameya Golf. It's peaceful there. - Do you know how pricey Katameya Golf is? - Stop this! We can't solve our problems this way! - Easy. We just remove the kids' section. - You see, Doctor? Why not remove men's health? She said remove men's health! We should urinate sitting down then! - Say something, you feminist! - Move my clinic. Each clinic is made by its speciality. Okay, Doctor. Dr. Asim, Dr. Mervat is new. We don't want her to have a tense start. Apologize to her. No. Please go to your clinic, Doctor. Asim. It's true that you're a genius doctor. But I can't keep putting up with you. Simple. Fire me. Or move me to Katameya Golf. It's okay, Doctor. It's not your fault. Dr. Asim has a pure heart. But sometimes he loses it. How dare he speak to me like that. Even my father never did that. He talks to all women like that. But he has a good heart. - Do you want some lemon juice? - I don't want anything. - Can I come in? - Come in, Doctor. I'm sorry. Fine. - Can I take this? - No. Asim, come watch this film. It's great. It's too silly. I'm not free. I have important research to do. Don't be annoying. It's as silly as the last film we watched. - I have no time for you! - You can act that way. You're a star. - Why? - I was with the minister of health today. She started praising you once she knew we're brothers. You have no idea. Your brother is a contraceptive pill developer. It's not just for women, it's for men too. Don't they want equality? Here you go, unisex pills. - Why were you with the minister? - I'm doing a family planning campaign. What does family planning have to do with you? They'll put my picture in hospitals. When pregnant women see it, they'll abort. Naive, but works. - Naive? I own an ad agency! - Really? - Be quiet. Just watch. - No, I have to go and do some reading. Where are your father and mother? Dad started the anniversary celebrations. He took your mom and went to the cinema. Your father's a real lover! What your father's doing isn't love. It's suffocation. Suite 1408. - Suite? - You thought it would be a room? Did you see that indecency? He gave her the room key. You're still new, so you don't know this. They're married and do this every year. Schizophrenic. Crazy people. Go back to work. - Hey, who are you with? - Get lost! "Get lost"? What's this? What's this? - What are you doing here? - I'm watering the plants. You son of a… What's this? The chocolate! This chocolate is for the guests! I am the guests! "I am the guests"? Sorry! Keep scribbling! - Keep making that creative art! - Stop it, boy. Hey, you! Let go! Hoda, what is going on? Yasmeen got them from the traffic lights. And, as you can see, I can't handle them. - Give me the pretty girl. - Give you the pretty girl? Are we sitting at the Corniche? Get lost! - Where's Yasmeen? - She's doing an audition. - What's your name? - Afaf Khaloun. - Is Khaloun your father's name? - I don't know who he is! - What's going on, Yasmeen? - Wait. Don't worry, dear. You can go. Hi. Cute. Stand here. - What's your name? - Sayed Moshrak, honey. Aren't you… I'm gonna thump you. What? I'm casting the kids for the ad. Are these kids? Afaf Khaloun and Sayed Moshrak? Them do an ad? They'll start a fight. They will give it the authenticity. They have to be homeless kids. Since their parents can't spend on them. You know what? You have a point. Carry on. Okay, you go, dear. Come. Stand here. - What's your name? - Hamu'a. Hamu'a must be your nickname. Is it Ahmed? - I don't know. - You, Hamu'a. Take your finger out. We're filming you. Hamu'a, dear, take your finger out, please. Great. Calm down, sir. Hamu'a is a beautiful boy and will understand what we want. You're gonna be on TV. You can't be on TV with your finger in your nose. - None of your business. - Put your finger in your nose. You can put it in my nose if you want. - Bring me a coffee and my first patient. - Yes, Doctor. - Awad. - Yes, Doctor. - Why is this here? - Dr. Mervat told me to give it to you. - Good morning. - You can go, Awad. Can we start on a clean slate? We don't need clean or dirty slates. We're not at war. I want to work in a suitable environment. I'll try to give the vaccinations when you're not around. Excuse me. - Doctor. - Yes? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - But aren't there any other colors? - I'll see. TESTOSTERONE AND ITS EFFECT ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH What's going on? What's going on? What else did you do to her? I was quiet, but I annihilated her. What is going on? What's this? I thought I was gonna shout at you for the TV being too loud! - Who are they? - Don't be afraid, girls. This is Dr. Asim, my brother. A doctor? A doctor of what? Of men's health. - Then you're my guy. - He said men's health! What stupidity! Don't embarrass the girl. She stood up for you. - Go on, get out! - No! There's no "get out." Nobody's going outside. - Calm yourself down, baby. - Of course, baby. Blow it out far away. What would we do if your parents came home now? That's sorted. Your father called and said he'll be back after tomorrow. - Take a hit. - A hit of what? Take a hit. Try it. - It's nice. - Is this a gas lamp? Take a hit. But treat it like a secret. - Take a hit, then keep it in. - I don't like these things, Bassem. - Be good. - One sip, just to not embarrass you. Take it. - Another hit. Another hit. - For my sake. Get the fun-loving Asim out. - Enough of the dull and annoying Asim. - Dull? The one everybody hates. The complicated Asim with glasses. - Asim who used to wear coats in the heat. - Light it up! Asim, the sick man. My dear boys fell asleep from exhaustion. - Dad? - And Mom! My boys would do that? Shame on you! Were it not for your mother, I'd have called the morality police. - Why all this, Dad? - Shut up! I leave the house for two days, I come back and find this debauchery! It's not my fault. Bassem brought those two pieces. Me? You said, "You look hungry. Have a piece!" Where was your mind, sane doctor? We go away for two days and this happens. - We didn't know you're coming back today. - Really? If we're not home, the house turns into a drugstore and a mess like this! Is this how I raised you? Blast you and those who had you! What? Why is it my fault? - They took after you! - Go up and we'll keep partying. That's enough. - You must have missed being hit. - Calm down, dear. That's enough, dear. Your health. These jerks don't deserve it. We took after you. That's enough. We're sorry. We promise it's the last time this week. One word, only marriage will sort you out! Understood? - That's my final word. - My final word, I'm not getting married! - I'll get married! - Go, you jerk. Go! The work for the Dubai show is in storage in Al Haram. The remaining work should be split today. You need anything else? Thank you. What's wrong, Ms. Somia? My stomach is upside-down. What did I eat? Don't flirt with me, okay? I wrote it and I said it Every word on joy is silent On love is silent I wrote it - Somia. - What? - What are you daydreaming about, my love? - What? Nothing. What's nothing? You've been distant since you got back from the doctor. Did he say something worrying? We'll go abroad right away. There's nothing, my love. Don't worry. Why travel abroad? - Let's bring that boy in to check you. - Hold on. I don't need stress. The doctor told me I need a gynecologist. I called Baleegh. I have an appointment with him tomorrow. And today? INVITATION Many congratulations, Doctor! Many congratulations, Doctor. Thank you, Dr. Baleegh. Congratulations, dear. Awad, give the doctor some juice. Juice too? - Here you go, Doctor. - Of course. Awad. I want you to give some to everyone in the hospital. We have great news. Thank you very much, Dr. Baleegh. But it's very strange. How did the news spread so fast? I only just got the invitation. - What invitation? - My honor at the family planning seminar. You think I'd get juice and slice up bananas for family planning? No, of course not. Family is important, but there's nicer and more important news. What? You got me excited. Many congratulations, Doctor. Mom is pregnant. Whose mom? - Your mom? - Your mom. Not funny! Who told you to say that? You crazy boy! I just discovered the cute little thing. She just left. What's this sound? - Pregnant by who? - Your father, of course. - Or are you suspicious of something? - What something? If you don't… Many congratulations, Doctor! Many congratulations, Doctor! Guys. I really don't know. Congratulate him! Congratulations! Bravo. Bravo, guys. You've made me happy. The advert has a lot of authenticity. Even the actors, they look homeless. For you to feel this authenticity so easily, I suggested to Yasmeen and insisted we bring actual street kids for the ad. I can see that you suggest and insist. The main thing is that you liked it. - Where is Mr. Nagib to give his opinion? - No. I ordered him to go to Aswan. If he stays next to his wife, he'll have a seventh child. Seventh? What's going on? You keep annoying me. I'm in a meeting. - Your mom is pregnant. - Whatever! Did you call to joke around with me? Since when do I joke around with you? I said your mom! Your mother who is my mother? Yes, the mother of us both. - How is she pregnant? - Ask your father. The suffocating one! Meet me now. We need a solution to this fiasco. - I told you. - Thank you. The best soup, sir. Thank you, Idrees. You'll have a lot of work in the coming months, Idrees. Whatever you wish, sir. I hope the wife feels better. Is she ill? - No. The wife is pregnant. - Kamel! - Who's pregnant? - Ms. Somia, you lunatic. - Unbelievable. People get old and go nuts. - Why, Kamel? - Please don't embarrass me. - Embarrass you? Embarrass you how? Are we doing something wrong? On the contrary, I am extremely happy. Wouldn't I be happy when the family tree keeps growing? I'm really confused. I can't believe it. Am I really pregnant? What will we tell the boys? When the time comes. Here you go, my love. Where's the train going? Is what Dr. Baleegh said true? Didn't I say Baleegh wouldn't keep quiet? You imbecile! No "hello," "good evening," or anything? Is it true or not, Dad? Bassem… Your mom is pregnant! Oh, my goodness. What will we do now? - What do you mean? - How will we show our faces? - What will we say? - Is your mom pregnant by the driver? - Kamel! - I'm sorry, dear. They annoyed me. What's wrong, dear? What's the problem? When Mom is pregnant at this age and has two grown up boys like us, it isn't a problem, it's humiliating! Humiliating? Why is it humiliating? What did I do wrong? - I am married to your father. - Somia. They need to know the truth! - Children are a blessing from God. - You're upset? You should be proud of Dad. - And me. - And Mom. Why proud? Did you get a medal for Egypt? No, we got a new child for Egypt. - You could have controlled yourself a bit. - Tell him. Move out of the way. - Mom, my love. - Yes. You know that we love you. - We also know that you love us. - So much, my love. How far along are you? Dr. Baleegh says I'm in the second month. Great! Second means you're still at the start. - What do you mean, boy? - Find a liberal doctor who'll end this. - Liberal? What do you think I do? - Boy! - Don't annoy him. He's very powerful now. - What's he gonna do? Come here. One more word, and I'll empty the pistol on you. Get it together! And listen up. What's inside me is my boy, like you sadly are. Maybe this baby will be kinder than you! Don't you ever bring up that topic again! I tell you what, boys. My wife is having cravings. And I don't want her to see this sight. Out. Out! Calm down. Rest. - See your boys, Kamel? - It's all right. It's all right, my love. Why do you think I'm getting a new one? Your parents have officially gone crazy. The mother of someone my age, my position and my occupation is pregnant? What about the minister whose family planning campaign I'm doing? Do I tell her Mom's pregnant at her age? She'd probably pull the campaign from me. Are you worried about the campaign and not the pregnancy? How about our appearance, how we'll look in front of people? We need to resolve this situation. Regardless of anything. How? I told them to go to the doctor. You saw what your dad did. What do you think I am? A barber? I'm a doctor. - I don't mean it, but it's a speciality. - The matter doesn't need speciality. The matter needs two pills and we're done. - What if something happens to Mom? - Are you crazy? Would I hurt my own mother? It's still early, so there's no worry. I tell you what, darling. I want to choose a new name, especially if it's a boy. For example, Ayham. I don't like it, Kamoola. - I prefer Saqib. - Saqib? What? Is he a rifle? No, we're going to have sesame as a child. Why puzzle ourselves? Don't we have Asim and Bassem? Then let's call him Asem. - Or Hasem. - Hasem? What are you talking about? So, every time he crosses the road, people say "Hasem"? - Good morning! - Yasmeen, my dear, I missed you! Gorgeous. Me too. How are you doing? - What are you doing here? - What? I mean, what are you doing here so early? I was talking to Auntie and found out about the baby. I wish the same for you, God willing. Bassem, do you know you're annoying? How did you not tell me Auntie is pregnant? - Sneaky Auntie surprised us. - I'm so happy I want to tell the world. - I love you. - Kamel, the kids are sat here. They should stand up. - What are you making, good man? - Juice for Ms. Somia. Your dad told me to blend carrot, plum and orange. It's good for pregnancy. You take the tea and coffee while it's hot. I'll make the juice. Why? I can make it myself. Mr. Idrees, I'm a doctor. My juice will be 100 times healthier. - Go ahead. - Go, go. - Hurry up so it doesn't get cold. - Okay. Okay. Oh, I hope it's a girl! - What do you think of the name, Solinaz? - It's really nice, Auntie. Golfinar is really nice too. - What do you think, Bassem? - God give me strength. Let's take Asim's opinion. Golfinar or Solinaz? My opinion is either Sport age or Tucson. Depends how much you have. - Here, love, try my handmade goods. - You made me a juice yourself? Of course. What's more precious than you? You're pregnant now. You need healthy things. Apple, lemon, carrot, celery with kiwi. No, I really can't. I just had breakfast. I can't. Simsim, don't be silly. These ingredients are great for pregnancy. I can't stand the smell of celery, Kamel! I'm going to pass out. - Your father just aborted. - Long ago. I don't know how he functions. It's actually really tasty. Try it. Just one sip and you'll feel better. I told you I can't. I can't, Kamel, please. - Just a lick. - Don't be dumb and tell them what's in it. It's okay, my love. I understand. It's morning sickness. Don't pressure Mom any more. Why don't we go rest upstairs for a bit? - Excuse us, Yasmeen. - Go ahead, Auntie. - What's that strange smell? - What's wrong? Bucci! Kamel, I can't stand little Bucci's smell. I want him gone when I get back from work. He has no place in our lives anymore. Sure, Dad. I'll give him to one of my friends who has a purpose. Who has a castle. - Do you want us to stay or go? - Yeah, we can stand your smell. - Where can I find someone like your dad? - Carrefour. With the eggs. Good evening, Doctor. I wanted to speak to you about something important. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - I'm sorry to disturb you on your break. - Don't worry. What's up? - Congratulations. - On what? - Isn't your mom pregnant? - Yeah. Thank you very much. - Anything else? - My friend has been married for two years, but she hasn't had a child yet. It's her husband. He's seen many doctors. - Nobody could do anything. - Why are they in a hurry to have a baby? They've been together for two years. These are the X-rays and test results. She brought them for me behind his back. He's depressed and won't see any doctors. That's extreme. So what if he can't have kids? Dr. Asim, do you hate kids? - Of course not. Nobody hates kids. - Of course. Headache. Nagging. Responsibility. Never-ending demands. You could say I pity them. Look at a child's face when you're sad. Just see what happens! There is hope. Can you get him to come? - How's our bride doing today? - Bride? You mean how's our baby doing? I'm really tired, boys. I had forgotten how tiring pregnancy was. No, you can do this, Mom. Come on, eat. Asim made you broccoli and cabbage soup. It's indescribable. I don't like broccoli or cabbage. You haven't tried them together. They're a great mix and good for the baby. I see you concerned for her health. You're even cooking for your mom yourself. My dear boys, so cute and tender with me. Of course, Dad. Why else did you raise me to be a doctor? - To cook? - No. So I can help you in these moments. - What about you? - Anything. I'll have the baby for her! This is a pregnancy, not a campaign. Never mind about the punctuation. The main thing is for Mom to eat. Come on, Mom. Eat. - No, I can't. - No, you have to eat. - It's very healthy, Mom. - Asim, I'll feed Mom. Right! The train driver's here to feed you. - Here you go, Dad. - Is he with us? See how well Dad drives? What do you mean you're not coming? Don't be annoying. Everybody's here. Haidy, leave me alone. I'm not in the mood. - You've changed and become so uptight. - It's nothing. It'll be over soon. Hang up. I'll call you in five minutes. - Yes? - What are you doing? None of your business. I just called to see if you did the revisions for the new spot. - I'm not working and I won't work. - Are you still upset about Auntie? You know what? It's so nice that you'll have a baby brother. I hope your mom gets pregnant, then you can experience this nice feeling. My dad is nothing like your dad. I never knew you were so lighthearted. Hang up. I wanna sleep. Hey, family professor? Nothing's happened to Mom. - Was the soup a fake? - Look, dear, your mom had the soup 30 minutes ago. So it should work in about… - Now. - You son of a… - Of a cabbage. - No, of a broccoli. - Oh, my goodness! - What's going on, Baleegh? Tell me. Get out. I need to work. Calm down, Dad. - Everything will be fine. - I hope so. It's Mom that matters, not the baby. - Who knows about the baby. Mom's old. - What are you saying? Stop talking that way about your mom! Shut up! - Dear God. - Mr. Daramaly? God help us. - Who's this Daramaly? - A nurse. What's going on? How's Somia doing, Nurse? All good, God willing. I'll explain. - The issue is… - No! - Don't say. I don't want to hear. - You asked and I want to explain. - Are you heartless? - You think saying the baby's gone is easy? Don't worry. We're still a blessing. What baby's gone, sir? The fetus is stable and doing great. - Then what happened? - Gases. - Gases? - The lady told the doctor she had cabbage and broccoli soup. Those two together gave her explosive gas. - Did she explode? - The doctor's inside. He gave her some charcoal tablets. It'll be all sorted out. Just let her sleep somewhere well-ventilated today. Can we leave her and pick her up tomorrow? - Kamel. - Yes, my darling. Is all this exercise okay for the baby? Do you want the baby to have sore muscles? Baleegh gave me these exercises for you. Do you think that I would sacrifice the boy I've been wishing for? Who are we then? Your cousins? If God blesses me with a boy, I'd have a boy and two girls. You might be blessed with another girl. Come and join us and encourage Mom. Come on! - You're my family too. - Come on, Mom. - Come on. Let's jump rope! - No! I'm tired and my back aches. - That's enough. - I can't. - I'm really tired. - No, you have to finish training. What do you think? Asim, encourage Mom. - Honestly, I'm dizzy. - Don't sit! - "Don't sit"? I told you I'm dizzy. - If she's dizzy, that's it. Leave her alone. Kamel, I'm sick of staying home. I walk at home. I train at home. - I want to go to work. - No, Simsim. We agreed. You'll stay home. We'll talk when you've had the baby. Mom's right. She shouldn't be oppressed because she's pregnant. - Oppressed? - He didn't mean it, Mom. Didn't you want a wonderful family day? Why don't we all go to Faiyum tomorrow? It's amazing and a change of scenery, instead of being bored. - Excuse me? - I really am bored. But I'm too lazy to travel. I'd never let your mom travel on her own. And I have work. - Who asked you? - Boy! Asim didn't mean it, Dad. Although, Dad is captain of the ship. He means, you go to work, then join later. What you think, dear? I could travel. But let's tell Yasmeen to come and keep me company. Then I'm not going. All right, all right. Good God! All Germany's good for is the Bayern team. The gas pump is broken again! - What? - The gas pump is broken? - You just fixed it five years ago. - You see? - Now what? - Get to Faiyum, then call a tow truck. - How will we get there? - We can call an Uber. Just keep quiet. What are you doing here anyway? Hey, guys, do you need help? Yeah, we were… - Nader? - Bassem? Nader! - Bassem? - What a coincidence. - Is there a fight or something? - No, it's my family. We're off to Faiyum. But my brother's car broke down. You're going to Faiyum? What luck. I was going duck fishing in Faiyum. Come! Get in, Mom. - We're riding with him? - Yeah, he's my friend. Get in. How cool! Are you going to catch ducks or score one? - Hello. - Hello. Thank you very much. - What for? - Where do you know the boys from? - Where? - Where? - I'll say where. - Where? - From school. - He's old. - Sports club. - Sports club. The sports club? I know everyone there. Stop it. He's not from that group. It's Captain Nader, the fencing trainer. - Fencing trainer? - He's fishing. He's a grilling trainer. - Right. - You could smell his training a mile away. - Excuse me, my brother's calling. - Go ahead. Hello. Yes, Ramez? What? An accident? They're beating him up in the street? - What do you mean? - What's going on? - I'll come now! - What's going on? My brother's being beaten in the street! - What brother? - He's my flesh and blood! I have to go! Let me out! - What are you doing? - My brother! My brother! Why would I care about him? Watch out! - Wear the cap! - Get off me! Shut your mom up or I'll hit her! You lunatic! What's happening? You're insane! Help me! Bump! Bump! - Tell me. What's going on? - Calm down. - What happened to Mom? - She's inside with Dr. Baleegh. - What did you do to her, you reprobates? - Us? - Us harm Mom? Did you hear that, Asim? - It's all right. - What's this? - It's his wife. He's worried about her. - Really? Wasn't it your friend who… - Stop it, girl. Stop. - Your friend? - Are you gonna trust a short person? - Tell me, Nurse. - Praise be to God. She's fine. The doctor's giving her a shot. She'll be able to leave with you today. - So, the baby's fine? - The baby's fine and doing very well. And is in his place. The only thing is Somia's back was sore. Sore? - Wow, you really don't bring any bad news. - I swear to God, if you get close to her, I'll destroy you! Is this what we get for our good deed? For taking our mom on a trip to Faiyum? - What happened anyway? A car… - Shut up! Liar. - Sorry to ask you again. - Go ahead. The mother and baby are unharmed? Ms. Somia is in the third month. The pregnancy is stable now. Yes! As soon as Mervat recommended you, I didn't hesitate to bring Shady to you. He doesn't like to go to doctors. But I trust Mervat's opinion. I don't trust anyone anymore. Nobody should trust a woman. Not women or men. - It's fleeting. - What? Life is fleeting. You're right, Mr. Shady. It's hard to find someone to trust now. What's this, Doctor? Are you encouraging Shady? I'm sure he saw many doctors to no avail. So, he has a lack of trust now. I don't know why my wife insists on this. Why bring an innocent child into this? A world full of lies and deceit. You're saying such wisdom, Mr. Shady. - Wisdom? - Bonbons? - Thank you. - What wisdom? Are we here to get pregnant or for you to put us off life? To be honest, I feel the same way. And what he's saying is convincing. Convincing how? Shady's depressed because we're not getting pregnant. How is it convincing? It's not worth getting depressed. Loosen up a little. Bonbons, Mr. Shady? - I'll take red this time. - Go ahead. I want you to be optimistic. Take this medicine and you'll get results. God willing. God is capable of all. God is indeed capable of everything. Mervat told us your mom is pregnant. In extra time. You can get going. I have other patients. Doctor, did something bother you? Nothing bothered me. Goodbye. I have other patients. Come on, lady. God bless you. Goodbye. - Thank you for the "gongons." - You're welcome. "Gongons"? It's bonbons. Go. Goodbye! What's this? Are you a dietitian now? Customers coming and going. - Not a care in the world. - What's that? - This is a clinic. - Isn't it my brother's? - No cigarettes in here. - That's cigarettes. What will we do about our catastrophe? Or is that the end of your genius? No new ideas? Forget it. Your mom's in the fourth month. Any attempt now will be a danger to her. - What do you mean? Are we giving up? - No, we have to explain it to them gently. We'll say we're grown men with friends. Mom's pregnancy will affect our work. If we share it, we must be very discreet. Being the show with the most credibility, we have a very bizarre story. Let's start with Dr. Baleegh Hamdy. Is it normal to get pregnant at this age? Usually, this is not something common, but it does happen sometimes. - What's that micro bus outside? - And what are these cables? What's this? Mr. Kamel, can you tell us how you felt when you heard the news? My heart was gonna stop out of happiness. - And out of fear for my wife. - May I always have you. Ms. Somia, what did you do when you heard the news? Honestly, I was worried and surprised. And I was very scared and embarrassed. But then Dr. Baleegh reassured me. And I saw the joy in Kamel's eyes. And I was so happy too and in disbelief. As for your boys, they're grown men. Did this cause them any disruption? Not at all. - They're proud of their father. - Of course. Our reproduction causes disruption? There are the boys. Come. - Boys. - Come. We should do makeup. Asim, Bassem, come. You come with me. My boys. Dr. Asim Kamel and Mr. Bassem Kamel. Congratulations on your mom's pregnancy. Hopefully your mom too. - Asim. - What? - He's gonna be your brother. - Mr. Bassem. Are you ready for a newborn at home? Ready how? Should I wear Pampers or have a pacifier? The king of the family. Asim and Bassem are happier than us that there will be a new baby. Wow, it really shows. Stay seated. How are you? - Fine. - Shall we start with the outdoor campaign? Or watch the new spot? No, there's no need. As far as watching, I've watched. It seems that Mom has the highest ratings. We'll repeat the prescription, Mr. Ahmed. - And I'll need to see you in 15 days. - God willing, Doctor. - Here you go. - Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. Awad. Yes, Doctor. Yes? - Should I bring in the next one? - No, I can't. Apologize and say the doctor's not well. Dr. Mervat was looking for you. Shall I let her in? Let her in, of course. Hurry. Why are you staring? - Dr. Mervat. - Yes? - Come in. - Thank you, Awad. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm Yaseen's mother. - Welcome. Come in. - How are you, Doctor? - How are you? What's going on? Yaseen's mother has a problem. She had to see you when she found out I knew you. - But I'm a men's doctor. - Yes. Dr. Baleegh is the gynecologist. You don't understand. I don't want you. - I want your mother and father. - What? I'm almost 60 and have only had Yaseen. I'd love a sibling for him. I wanted to know how your parents did it. - Take Yaseen's mother and get out. - Why? Take Yaseen's mother and get out, or I'll show you how they did it! - Wanna see how they did it? - What? What did we say wrong? I'm very sorry. - See how mischievous they are? - The boy turned out mischievous like you. - The boys are here. - You gave birth? What's this? The scan. I had it done today. - Twins. - Twins? Taleed and Perihant. - What's Perihant? - You're surprised by the name Perihant? And not by the name Bareed? Bareed is canceled, Dad. - Taleed. - Congrats. May they live in your glory. And in your glory. Aren't you their older brothers? Mom, Dad, we have a fateful decision to tell you. What? What? Tell me, my love. We're leaving and will each live alone. Are you threatening us, Captains? Get lost then! - The door's big enough for a camel. - Wait, Kamel. Are you punishing me for this? What did I do? What did I do wrong? What should I have done? Shame on you to punish me any more. I'm the one who's going to leave home! Nobody will ever find me! Mom! What's happening? What's wrong? - Don't be sad. They're no longer our boys! - No, Kamel. Don't say that. These are my boys and those are my boys. I'll never forgive myself if anyone left. Do you want to hurt your mother? It's okay, Mom. We'll do whatever makes you happy. What will make me happy is nobody leaves unless you're married and going home. Don't joke around. Hang up. Looks like I'm in the wrong house. You too? - Can you explain what you did? - What's this? No "good evening." Calm down. - How could you take our rooms? - I'm free to do that. It's my house. What kind of response is that? Didn't you tell them to clear their rooms? Why should I? - I'm free to do that. It's my house. - We know it's your house. It's all right, dears. It's a boy and girl. They each need a room. What will this joker and jack do? They have a room on the roof. Roof? Are we installing a satellite dish? Is that room big enough for us both? - It's temporary, Son. - Is he building another room on the roof? Aren't you supposed to get married? Or one can get married and leave the room for the other. - We said we'd leave and you said no. - Again? Are you trying to kill me? - That's enough. I'm tired! Kamel! - No, no! Boy! Go. Get lost. We're gonna sleep. We're leaving tomorrow. - Where? - I'm free to do that. It's my house. You're taking the house? Where are you going? We're going to Alexandria. Mom is about to give birth. She's feeling a little down. - What, my love? - I want Gandofli. What's wrong with you? If I found someone like your dad, I'd hold on to him forever. He would suit you. You know what, Yasmeen? I feel like my dad treats my mom that way so she doesn't uncover some disaster. - What kind of disaster? - He has another wife or girlfriend. - Because this isn't normal. - Why? Because he's taking her on a trip? There are men out there like your dad, but they're rare. Most people can't stand each other after two years of marriage. Then there's someone like your dad. Look how he teats your mom. And she's pregnant! Yasmeen, you're really annoying. Here you go. Mr. Tender is calling. Bassem, my love, congratulations. Your mom gave birth as soon as we arrived. Your siblings couldn't wait any longer. Your sister Perihant wants to talk to you. Welcome back, Mom. Welcome back, my love. Thank you, my love. Dad said it was an easy birth, thank God. Easier than yours. - Kamel. Peri looks just like Bassem. - God forbid. You want the girl to not marry? Bassem sadly looks like me. But Perihant and Taleed look like you, gorgeous. Congratulations! May you enjoy Perihant and Baleed. - Baleed? - Sorry, sir. I forget their names. - Here you go, the Moghat. - No. Kamel, ever since I got pregnant, you've been stuffing me with food. We just ate pastry. I can't eat or drink. - Shall I bring you some tahini halva? - No, fenugreek tea's better for feeding. Sure. Boys. Are you gonna hold your siblings? Here, Bassem. Here, my love. Hold your sister. - To be honest, I'm scared to hold a baby. - Don't be afraid. I'm right here. Hold. Hold. Boy! In the name of Allah. - You too, Asim. - We already have one, Dad. In the name of Allah. - Shall we go rest upstairs for a bit? - No! Why rest? It was an easy birth. This is too much. I don't need all the crying too. Isn't it enough we're in the dog's room? - That's enough. - In the name of Allah. What's wrong? What did you feed them? What do you think? Rice and peas? They must have indigestion. I swear, we can't sleep. - What shall I do? Your siblings are tired. - Why are you standing here? Why not put them to sleep in your room? I have work early. Your voice! We don't need that too. - Bassem, go and boil some caraway, quick. - What? Me? Make caraway tea? Where's Idrees? Idrees is fast asleep and he's too slow. Hurry. I don't think Idrees can help us in this new situation. Where's Saeeda? Wasn't she gonna give birth, then return? I called her, of course. It was a difficult birth and she's tired. She's not coming back to work. - We need to find someone to help us. - Are you still talking? Go boil the caraway! Go on, Bassem. Go. - Asim. - What, Dad? Go to the pharmacy quickly and bring some gripe water. Why gripe water? Bassem's making caraway tea. What's all this talking? Go. Dad, call them on the phone. Get them to deliver. Why? Am I ordering Kentucky Fried Chicken? Go, hurry up! Is this nagging following me? Awad. Awad! Yes, Doctor. - Shall I bring in the other patients? - No, I wanna sleep. What about Mervat? Didn't we arrange the appointments? We'll give them all these medicines. And, hopefully, it won't happen again. Shame on you. Asim. How are you, my dear? - Good morning. - Good morning. Your siblings are gorgeous, Dr. Asim. You're the gorgeous one. Why didn't you tell us about this clever doctor? Who? Why are you here? They kept us up all night. We wanted to get them checked. Why are you so upset? You gave us such a hard time at their age. - It's true, Dr. Mervat. It is Mervat, yes? - Yes. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. He was a pain from the start. He had diarrhea for two days, right? Yeah. And his diarrhea was yellow. - It stank. - That's enough. Why are you mentioning the color? It's diarrhea. Will it be olive green? It's yellow. Come on, goodbye. Come on, Mom. - My pleasure. - Thank you. - Goodbye, my dear. - I hope they feel better. - Oh, Doctor? - Yes, my love? - Don't forget tomorrow. - I'll be there. - I'm waiting for you. - Goodbye. - Doctor. - Yes? - What's tomorrow? - The baby shower. - Whose? - Your siblings, Perihant and Taleed. - Thank you. Pleasure. - Beautiful like her mom. Thank you, my dear. It was a pleasure. The same for Isra'a and Khaled. - They can't have kids. - I thought I'd just say anything. - May they live in your glory. Gorgeous. - My dear. I hope you enjoy seeing them get married. Let me see the older ones marry first! Enjoying your husband's enough. Congrats, Somia. - My dear. - You little boy, Talid. - It's Taleed. - I'm your aunt, little boy. - And he's sleeping. - Yes. Who did he get his good looks from? He looks like he'll steal all the girls. He'll steal all the girls. Congratulations, Uncle and Auntie. They look so cute. I wish the same for you. I wish the same for you. Please, God. Listen to your mother. Don't listen to your father. - Don't turn them against me, Nabeela. - Listen to your father. - And your aunt. - Really? Why did you leave, Doctor? Nothing. I felt… - Embarrassed. - Why? You want a grown man like me whose mom just had twins to be happy? Of course. This is a gift from God. - A gift, how? - And a blessing too. Because in your line of work, you help so many people have a child. That's their conviction. Because I do this work it doesn't mean it's my conviction. Like a plumber. He clears drains for work, not because he likes drains. That's a really bad example, Doctor. Really. Drains? What was the first thing you thought when you saw your siblings? Nothing unusual. I carried them… When I first held them against my chest, I got goose bumps. Because that's true love. Innocent love. It's pure love. It's unconditional. Love doesn't exist. Love does exist. And this subject requires a lot of talk. Another time. Can we go in now? - Go in and do what? - Hug your siblings and enjoy them. Hey, Mr. Annoying. Why are you so grumpy? Leave me alone. Is it my fault you're my cousin? Don't you want a cute baby like that? No, I don't feel like it. Quiet. Quiet. Hello. What's up, Haidy? Wait. I'll finish up with this circus and come. Yeah, I need to loosen up. Bye. You're going out? Why not? Do I have to study? Don't forget we have a very important meeting tomorrow with Mazen. Mazen is a very important client. I've been convincing him to work with us. Do you produce 1,000 words a minute? Are you a robot? I'll be there before you. And be quiet. Let's see. SEVEN MONTHS LATER My love! Welcome back, Ms. Somia. We haven't seen you for a long time. What could I do? I had to wait for them to grow up a bit. Tell me, how are things? Everything for the Dubai show is ready. Do you want me to ship it? No. Wait a little. - Who does Mom love? - Ms. Somia. - Hello, Abu Sakr. How are you? - We haven't heard your voice in a while. I might not make it to the show this year. How? Your products were best sellers last year. Don't do this, Ms. Somia. It will be a loss for you and us. This is the new box we designed. The colors are better than the last one. Bravo, Yasmeen. The box is amazing. - I should have worked with you ages ago. - Mazen. This box is mine and Yasmeen's design. We worked hard to find a suitable idea. The effort is obvious. When do you want to sign the contract? It won't work at the moment. We have campaigns for other companies. The secretary will call when we find time. No, Mazen has priority. We're ready to sign anytime. Okay, I'll wait for you tonight. Bring the contracts and we can start work. - All right. Bye. - Bye. Congrats. Congratulations for what? And what's this about tonight? I've known Mazen for ages. We were all in the same group. We're used to going out together at night. Cinema, sit in a café. It's normal. No, it's not normal. I'm telling my aunt. My mom knows, by the way. I'm not doing anything wrong. Stop being childish. - You're childish. I'm working seriously. - I don't see you doing your work. I'm going to work. - What's wrong, Bassem? - Why are you here now? Do you have stuff? They'll take it at night. Got it? Okay. Dr. Asim. You go now. - Dr. Asim. - Yes? - How are you? - Hi. How are you, Doctor? - Fine. - I wanted to say thank you. Thank me for what? - Because Manal's pregnant. - Who's Manal? My friend Manal. Shady's wife. The one you treated. Oh, Manal! Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. Why are you thanking me? I didn't do anything. It was Shady. Didn't you help him? - Yes, right. - Yes. Doctor. How about… I take you out for something, somewhere? Celebrate the happy occasion. You know what made so happy about Manal? Of course. Your great medical triumph. Not at all. It's obvious that Manal loves Shady. But there's a crack between them. The crack could grow and lead to divorce. Her pregnancy saved their love. Their love? Does love actually exist, Doctor? Yes, love does exist. Can you believe it? But it's new, so not everybody knows it. - What you're saying is impossible. - Don't you care about the factory name? I thought I gave birth to men. To stand by me and take responsibility. Forget about him. He's worthless. Our beautiful, intellectual doctor's here. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hi, Tali. Hi, Peri. Hi, Asim. Come and see the disaster your parents are gonna make. Are they having another baby? Good idea. For the kids to play with someone. No, they want to travel. Let them travel. Let people enjoy themselves. - Why are you so cool and happy? - Why don't you let him be happy? Because he doesn't know that you're leaving Perihant and Taleed with us. What? - Is this guy talking seriously or joking? - A mix. - What do you mean, mix? - What can we do? The Dubai conference Mom goes to annually. Should she not go? Have we forgotten the gifts? - Pull yourselves together. - Take the kids with you when you travel. Take tiny little babies with me? And I'm gonna be very busy. Don't worry. Abdu got me a housekeeper. She starts tomorrow. She's a really good girl. She needs the work. It's just a few days. Goodbye, my loves. I'm gonna miss you. Bye. I'm gonna miss you so much. I wish I didn't have to go. Don't annoy your brothers or be naughty. Listen to them. Nagla, take care of them. Don't worry, Ms. Somia. I know everything. I have written everything down for you. And the feeding times. Most importantly, change the Pampers because of the chafing. Take care. These are your siblings. We don't know her. She's still new. - She can hear you, Mom. - If they eat but still cry, they're bored. - Them? - Yes. - Don't worry. We're not gonna throw them. - You rascals. She looks very polite and no trouble. Sing to them if you put them to sleep. - Then why did we bring Nagla? - To listen to us singing to them. That's enough. Come on. Bye. I'm gonna miss you. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, miss. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. Don't forget to pray for us. Pray for you in Dubai? Yes, sure. And I'll bring you a gown and a hat. The most important thing, Mr. Khamees, in order to get results, is to take the medicine. - God willing. - And stop the Estoroxan. - Okay. - Your kids deserve that money more. - What kids, Doctor? - Oh, yeah. You can't have kids. Excuse me, I'm sorry. - Here. - Okay, Doctor. - Get well soon. - Thank you. Awad. Yes, Doctor. - Get me a coffee. - Sure. Shall I go to Dr. Mervat? - For what? - There's a lot of crying today. Get me coffee and bring the next patient. - Did Auntie travel? - This morning. And Dad's with her too. He can't stay away from her. What about Perihant and Taleed? We got a very polite and respectful nanny. I'm really hungry. Do you want me to order a burger for you? - Burger? Enough, you're getting fat. - What? I'm joking with you. Why don't we go and have lunch together? No, we have a lot of work. We can't. Hello. How are you, Mazen? We have a lot of work. Really? No. What did you do? What's this? Who's crying? Who's crying? Daddy Asim is here. Daddy Asim is here. Why are you crying, silly? Come, my love. Come. In the name of Allah. What is this smell? How are you children? Nagla! Nagla, you nuisance! What's wrong, Doctor? Doctor? You're the doctor. Nagla… You left them alone and went where? - The bathroom. - Why didn't you take me... Why didn't you take them to the bathroom? At least change their Pampers first. I changed them twice today. What do you mean twice? I change more than twice a day! Why are you staring? Get the Pampers. Good God. Watch out for the beauty. - It's all right, my love. - Whoa. What's going on at home? - This girl is gonna give us a hard time. - Very. - Here, the Pampers. - I'll take them off you. - Aren't you gonna change them? - No, of course not. I just put nail polish on. It needs ten minutes to dry. Some take 30 minutes to dry. - Tell him. - Get lost! Get out of my sight! Get lost! Dry that stuff and go! "I put nail polish on." Go on, Bassem. How? What if Dad comes back? What did you think I meant? You scumbag. Change your sister, Perihant. - You're joking. - Come on, before they get chafing. You keep Perihant, and I'll change Taleed. Are you crazy? I'm a men's doctor. I can't change a girl. Is it by speciality? I do ads, so should I change him on TV? Mr. Idrees. Mr. Idrees. - Yes? - Are you here? - I'm everywhere. - What's going on? Look properly. - My problem is that I am looking properly. - Tell me. Where's the caraway? The children's tummies are upset. - The caraway's here. - What's wrong with you, Mr. Idrees? What's wrong? - Don't call me Mr. Idrees. - What do you want me to call you? Call me Dee so. Hi, Mom. You're fast asleep and your siblings are in tears? How do you know our siblings are in tears? You know I have cameras in their rooms. It's okay. Maybe Nagla forgot to feed them. Go see why they're screaming! Okay, Mom. You go to sleep and who cares about us. Girl, I'm just doing this job for fun. Are you flirting with me, Idrees? You look like you cough up dust. Just so you know, I have 300,000 EGP in the bank, in 200 EGP bills. - And a two-story house in the village. - Are you serious, Idrees? I swear. Ever since my wife died, I've been lonely. Nagla, you nuisance! Where's Peri and Taleed's food? Bassem. Bassem. Wake up. Your siblings must be awake now. Why did we bring that idiot downstairs? Wake up. Wake up. Enough, enough. Enough, Peri. Enough, Taleed. Did you wake her up? Wake who up? The girl ran off with Idrees! Read! See what Alejandro Idrees wrote. Give me. "Tell Mr. Kamel not to be angry with me. I would do anything for him, but I'm old and tired"… - Why the cough? - It says that. No, that's crying. "I found the love I wanted in Nagla. We're married and will be together forever." What's wrong with men that age? Your dad and Mr. Idrees. Guys come to my clinic that aren't even 30 and they have no love prospects. He says he'll spend his life with her. He can't even handle a kiss on WhatsApp. The children seem really hungry. Here, I'm going out. Will you make them a bottle? No, I'm gonna change. I have to go to the hospital. Hospital? I have to go to work. I have contracts to sign. What will we do, Bassem? Call Aunt Nabeela. She loves children. Do you have Alzheimer's or are you stupid? Aunt Nabeela's in Dahab. - What's with this mischievous family? - What will we do now? Did you bring the baby bottle? Did you bring the Pampers? - Are you scared? - Terrified. Hey, Yasmeen. What minister? Aren't we signing the contract with Mazen? Oh, thank God. I'm coming. This is good. Very good. I don't want you to worry, Mr. Ramzy. I've seen much worse than your situation. And now they have four or five kids. May God make that come true. You can't imagine how much I want this. Children are the best thing in the world. - You're hungry, right? - Awad! The bottle! Yes, Doctor. Here it is, Doctor. God's will. Is this your son, Doctor? My son? He's my brother. I should rest assured then! May God protect him. Excuse me, Doctor. What do you want? To be honest, Ms. Yasmeen, the company that took the campaign after you, I don't like their work. Can you believe the numbers have gone up since they took the campaign? I don't know. - I don't understand what's in their ads! - Don't worry. - We're ready to return with better ideas. - Great. - Where's Mr. Bassem? - He said he'd be late because of traffic. But don't worry. He'll arrive soon. Good morning. I'm very sorry for being late. Don't worry, Mr. Bassem. How are you? Is that your brother, Mr. Bassem? Brother? Didn't you notice the earrings? I thought it was to ward off the evil eye. No, this is my sister. My, how ugly she is! Do you see how ugly she is, Abdel Samad? She looks just like you. So ugly! What will you drink, Bassem? If it's not too much, tea and Cerelac for Peri. We're closing the Pampers now. This isn't your kind of work at all. Can I take over? What, my love? No. It's all right. It's okay. We're done. It's all right. It's okay. We're done. Is Taleed not well? No, he's fine. Does he not look well? Not at all. Don't worry. Because you brought him to the hospital. We woke up and the housekeeper was gone. And Mom and Dad are away. Mr. Taleed will join me in my clinic until you finish work. Is that okay? No, I don't want to disturb you. Not at all. Did you forget who usually disturbs who? - You, of course. - What? I don't mean it. Your clinic is very boring for him. Mine has toys. I'm sure he'll enjoy it. - Leave him with me. - Okay. How cute are you? How cute are you? What's this? How cute are you? She looks sleepy. I'll put a cartoon on. Cartoon? She's still young. We'll be leaving in five minutes. Did you forget our meeting with Mazen? Yasmeen, why don't we cancel with Mazen? Didn't God bless us and we're working with the ministry again? - Are you having second thoughts? - Honestly, yes. I've never felt comfortable with Mazen. Why? He's a great guy, and he has a very good reputation. And successful and handsome. Handsome? Why are you defending him like this? He's going to be my fiancé. Fiancé? Fiancé, how? He asked to meet Dad and I agreed. He's a groom that can't be refused. Okay, I'm going now. Bye. - Doctor. - Yes? Taleed told me, "Aunt Mervat did a lot for me today. - And I want to take her for dinner." - Really? Thank you. - I agree. - So, I'll see you tomorrow? God willing. Why haven't you changed? Hey, you. What's wrong? Yasmeen's getting engaged. Why are you upset? I don't know. Well, I know. Because us men are like that. When something's in our hands, we don't feel it. As soon as we feel we're about to lose it, we get sad. Anyway, don't get so upset. They're all traitors. Answer. It's Mom. Tell me, how are Peri and Taleed? They're fine, Mom. Don't worry. They have a feeding in 30 minutes, and we'll change them then too. Where's that useless girl I brought? I'll have words with her when I get back. You won't find that useless girl when you get back, because she left. How? It's okay. We'll be back after tomorrow. Travel safely. Here. - I'm going to sleep. - Okay. What's this? And Taleed? Asim! Asim! Your siblings are feverish and have the runs. - How could you let them get like this? - What's wrong? It looks like poisoning. To the operation room immediately. Stomach pumping immediately. Come on. Come on. What operation? She said operation, Asim. What exactly did you feed them? - I was… - Talk. Did you feed them after I went to sleep? Chocolate. They couldn't get to sleep, so I gave them some chocolate. They liked it. They were still hungry, so I gave them the koshari that was in the fridge. - That koshari's been there for a week. - Then it must be off! No. I thought the same, but I smelled it. It was like normal koshari. Normal? They're babies. Their stomachs can't handle all that! God help us. - Asim, you know that… - Are you insane? What will I do with you? God help us. Tell me, Bassem. They're still ill, but we're giving them a solution to try to replenish what they lost. Hopefully, with the medicine, they'll become stable. What do you mean try? If you're a useless doctor, tell us so we can find another! What? Dr. Asim, I appreciate your situation. Your siblings are in danger. Everything's in God's hands. It's my fault, Asim. It's my fault. Bassem, God willing, they'll be fine. You could go home. There's no use staying. No, we're staying. We'll only leave with them. They'll be fine, right? Of course, they'll be fine, God willing. Don't worry at all, guys. They are completely fine. Thank God. - Thank God. - Thank God. Thank you for this good news, Mervat. When I get married and have kids, - I won't find a better doctor. - My pleasure. Taleed's better now. He just has to fulfill his promise and take me for lunch. - No. - What? I'm sorry I thought about you and that you'd be something important in my life. - What's wrong, Asim? - Asim! What happened to the boys? - Nothing, Mom. - What happened? - They're fine. - Tell us. Calm down. It's nothing. - It was minor and they're fine. - The boys are good? Perfectly fine. Thank God. Thank God. - There's something critical you must know. - Somia! Do you still insist? I can't take it anymore. You need to know the truth. - What truth? - My children! My children! Shaima'a and Ala'a. How could you, Ms. Somia? Is this the honesty you promised? Did you call her, Simsim? Shouldn't she be reassured? Don't worry, Saeeda. I swear, the kids are well. What's all this noise you're making? We gave you insurance money for your kids. If anything happened, you'd have it. Wait a second. What's going on? - Who are Shaima'a and Ala'a? - My kids! What about your kids? Those two inside are Shaima'a and Ala'a. They're my kids. I almost died having them. I'm still not feeling well. Her kids? What's wrong with you? Are you heartless? How could you neglect your kids? I didn't. I'm loaning them out. Two hundred EGP a day. I thought they could have nice food. Wear nice clothes. Let me go see my kids! Shaima'a. Ala'a. I think the game's over now. If you weren't my mom and dad, I would have behaved very differently. Our reckoning is with old Dr. Baleegh. I'll hang him from the door! Wait, you two. - It's not Baleegh. - No. My tests did say that I was pregnant. Then what happened? Your mom's results were mixed with someone else's results. By the time we got the lab results, the news had spread everywhere. So, your mom's pregnancy was a lie. Baleegh was going to tell you. But we asked him to stick with the story. Why? Why all this? So you could learn. So I could teach you! - Why? What did we do? - We know you wanted your mom to miscarry! What? - Were you doing that? - Are you insane? Of course not. Shut up. What, Doctor? You forgot about the broccoli soup? And you, mister. Your friend that could've killed us! I can't believe I have this much on you. You're ready to harm your mom because of your selfishness and what people will say. What if something happened to me? - What can broccoli do to you? - What will happen? - Are you gonna be dumb? - No, Mom. We wish you no harm. You're right. We did wrong. To right our wrong, we're leaving home. - What's this? - Wait! Give my inheritance to Shaima'a and Ala'a. - Dr. Asim. - Asim. - Bassem. - Asim. - Bassem! - Asim! - Bassem! - Wait! Get off me! Why are you doing this? What's wrong? What's wrong, Son? Why are you doing this? What did we do wrong? You deceive us and think that's not wrong? You're the ones whose lives were wrong. Scared of responsibility. Scared of marriage. You hate children and see them as a headache. We thought we'd bring you a headache so you'd understand. You know the problem now? There's no more Perihant and Taleed. You're right. We loved them. We truly loved them. We liked their laughter and nagging. We even liked the moment we changed them. - No, he's psycho. - You see? The plan worked out. You have changed and understood. Yes, we changed, Mom. But it seems there's no luck. Or maybe we changed too late. There's an English saying, "Better late than never." Okay, Auntie, I'm going. Goodbye. Catch her. Yasmeen, where are you going? I'm meeting Mazen to get the rings. You can get a sandwich with Mazen. You're going to buy the rings with me! - At last! You jerk! - Congratulations! - You've made my heart happy! - A million congratulations! Asim. Asim! Won't you congratulate him? For what? He's an idiot. Learn, Son. Before you lose your chance. With all due respect, girls nowadays are all liars and traitors. What? One second. Who are liars and traitors? Stop taking your problems out on women! - Not all women are traitors! - Don't get worked up or I'll talk. I will get worked up. - If I talk, I'll embarrass you. - Embarrass me? And that guy you jumped on in the car? Where and how? What are you saying? When I brought Taleed to the hospital. He told me to look, and you were all over the guy! That's my brother. Yes, because my car was at the mechanics. And he had to take me home. You know what I'm gonna do to you? I'm gonna leave you to your crazy complexes! You're right. If I were her, I'd give you a slap to wake you up! Complicated person. Asim, do like I did. I'm sorry. I don't accept your apology. - You're a children's doctor? - Yes. I'm a child, and I made a mistake! It's your job to cure my complexes! Come on, so we can choose rings with them. - Yes! - The same car, cheaper. - Okay. - Okay? - I tell you what, my love. - What, my love? Now we've checked on the boys, why don't we go to Ain Sokhna for a month? I'm exhausted. Grow up. That's enough. It might happen for real this time. Let it happen for real. Let's go. - Asim! Help me! - Be careful! What's wrong? - I'm dizzy! - Mom, what's wrong? I feel faint and dizzy. Faint and dizzy? It must be flu symptoms. What flu? Your mom looks pregnant! - Pregnant! No! - I hope! Baleegh! You and your moves! - No, Kamel! - Come on, my love! Subtitle translation by: Nadia McKinney
