Hi, Elmer. - How's it going, Bruce? Three and a half minutes and I ain't heard a whistle yet. Hey, Foster. There is some news for you. Thank you very much, Mrs Ferguson. You are very welcome, Mr Brooks. And I wish you'd hurry back, Mr Brooks. You sit on your left foot for about 3 minutes .. While I run down to the express car and get the payroll for overall factory. Oh, you bankers. All you ever think of is money. Hmm? - Yes, and you know it. You're almost as bad as my husband. Let him print that in his paper. I wish I could be somewhere where there isn't any such thing as money. How do you do, Mrs Ferguson. - Hello, Bruce. Is Mr Ferguson coming up from New York today? Why, I don't know. I hope so. He's been working very hard. Hello, Bill. - Hello, Judd. You got that express package for me? - You bet I have. Well here you are, boy. Thanks, Jimmy. - Be seeing you. Well, well. Mr Ferguson. Well this is news. A visit from you in the middle of the week. Good afternoon, Foster. No. Nothing of importance. Just saw a chance to take a couple of days rest. We3ll my dear, this is a pleasant surprise. Why George, what .. I'm awfully glad to see you. Yes, but it seems I failed to surprise you. Oh, I was just driving around and I .. I thought I'd stop by and see who was on the train. I'm glad you did. How is junior? Why, he's fine. All aboard! I bet it ain't much fun Mrs Ferguson being married to that old .. Compound interest buzzard. Oh, hello dad. Been fishing? - Uhuh. How is your dear little wife? She is pretty well, considering. When is the baby expected? Not for four months yet. Well, so long. I've got to get over to the bank. You do want to go to the city don't you, Toni? Of course. Don't you? Really? Look. These people getting out of the car. Couldn't that be you and I? You in the high hat and the shirt front. And I in those furs. Going there, where there is something doing. Real music. Important people. And the Lord know what all. But where could we get that in Cornwall? Or this. Or this. Now tell me, where could a girl get anything like that here? I suppose there are people who have such things. Or else they couldn't afford to advertise them. I suppose there are. They're people who went out and got them and just didn't sit and wish for them. I guess you're right, Toni. I'll make a try for it. The only thing that bothers me is how. Well, a lot of them have got there from smaller towns than this. Look 'em up in Who's Who. Most of the star reporters in New York broke out in little towns like this. Old MacIntyre had a list of them in his column the other day. Warren Bennett of The Mail came from somewhere out in Wyoming. Bob Parks of the New York Globe started in Binghamton. Lindsay Jameson of The Despatch broke in on some little sheet out in Iowa. Willard Keith. Floyd Bolton. Claude Buchanan. Gee, all of them got their start in the sticks. But how did they get to New York? - You'll get your chance. A big story will break someday. And then you can show those city editors what you can do. Yeah. The story will probably be about my own funeral. Come on, let's go out and get a bite to eat. Oh, I've got to finish this story about the Women's Relief Corps meeting. Joe Hamilton is bringing me in some coffee and sandwiches. You'd better run along. Alright. I'll go out and shoot the mayor or somebody and make a story. Oh say Toni, can you spare that magazine for a little while? Why, yes. Thanks. Bruce. Bruce dear. - Yes, honey? You know, I was just thinking. When you do get to the big city. You won't forget all about poor little Toni? Don't be silly. What else would I be going for? [ 2x Gunshots! ] Charlie, what was that? Ah, just a flivver backfiring on Ferguson's Hill. [ Gunshot! ] That was no backfiring. That was a shot. Isn't that old Jenny Gibbs on the mule? Say, let's get out of here. Oh, nothing ever happens in a town like this. We were just saying Bruce ought to go to New York. Where he'd get a chance. He ought to get clean out of the newspaper business. Ain't any money in it anymore. As far as I can see. - No money? Why, do you know much some of those reporters in New York get? 200 dollars a week. That's money, isn't it. Well, that's a whole lot of money alright. For snooping around in other folk's business. It isn't snooping. Why, telling people what's going on in the world .. Is one of the highest forms of public service. Why, it's .. - Hello, Joe. Hello Bruce. Here's your magazine, Toni. I guess I won't try to read it tonight. [ Telephone ] Hello? Bruce? Bruce? Jess Haynes just phone the Sheriff's office. That there has been a shooting at the Ferguson place. Oh boy! What is it? A shooting up at the Fergusons. This sounds like a real story. Tell Tom to keep everybody on until I get back. Oh Bruce! But it's almost quitting time. I don't care. I'm going to give this town its first extra. Joe, tell the boys. What's happened, Sheriff? - Don't know yet, Bruce. Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't seem to be nobody around. - Come on, let's try and get in. Pat, run that way to the servants. They don't seem to have heard nothing. Alright. Funny. Lights ain't on. Turn on the switch. The wires must be cut. Come on. We're going upstairs. Hey Vic. Where are all them servants? Bring them lights in here. Somebody has shot him plenty. Is he dead? Well if he ain't, we're going to have to get a new word for it. Bring them lights a little closer. [ Moaning noises ] Why, she's all tied. There, there. You'll be alright in just a jiffy. Now tell us. What happened? They killed him. They killed him. Who killed him? - I don't know. They came in and shot him. - Who shot him? I Don't know. - Were they burglars? Yes. Burglars. Now, what did these burglars look like? One was big and had black hair. The other was little and freckle faced. I think his hair was sort of sandy. And he had a big scar on his chin. Now tell us just how everything happened. We were asleep. I heard the window open and .. Woke up and told Mr Ferguson. He got up and put on the lights and .. And then they jumped at him. Oh, it was terrible. He .. he hit the big man. And the red-haired man shot him. And then they grabbed me. Did these burglars steal anything? I guess I must have fainted. That's all I remember. Oh .. my ring has gone. It was a 6-carat blue diamond. Mr Ferguson gave it to me. When Junior .. You here all evening? Yes, sir. Did you hear anything? Well. Yes. - Oh. Come outside a minute. I want to talk to you. "Less than 2 hours after a bitter quarrel with his beautiful young wife." "Over an asserted indiscretion with a small town Romeo." "George M Ferguson, millionaire chairman of the Tradesman Bank of New York." "Was found murdered last night in the bedroom of his summer residence here." Copy. But you just now sent the same thing, Bruce. Yes, but that was for The Despatch. This goes to the New York American. You want to keep me here all night? - I can't tell. We're in the big-time newspaper game now, Pete. Mr Ferguson was one of the most important bankers in America. Why, this story is international. So this is Cornwall. City of opportunity. Cornwall. Sleeping peacefully beside your winding overall factory. We bring you fame. Your name is destined to shine in 72-point Gothic .. On the front page of the metropolitan press. Not only mine .. but the lesser sheets. Represented by my lowly confr?res. Who are even now approaching your fair borders. I thank you. Got anything left in that jug, Jim? - Very little. "Cornwall. Where we halt." "Cornwall. Where we halt." Let me have a little water, will you. - Some water? - Yeah. Say, how far is it to Cornwall? Seventeen miles. Gee, I wish we'd get some coffee. I'm cold and hungry. Well you can't do it, Maizie. You can probably get some at the jail while you're talking to her. Oh, I sometime wonder why I ever got myself into a job like this. Think of all the interesting people you meet, my dear? Yeah. Like you and Eddie. And that fascinating personality out there with a boil on his nose. Now is that nice? I ask you. Hey punk. Wake up. Hey .. come alive. Where can I find this guy Foster? I'm Foster. Why, how do you do, Mr Foster. I'm Robert Parks of The Globe. And this is Jim Perrin, my associate. How are you? I hope you'll pardon my mistake. I was expecting to find a much older man after reading that story you filed. Was it alright? - Alright? Why it was a great job, Mr Foster. I suppose you can direct us to one of the better hotels. Well, there is only one in town. I'd be glad to take you there myself. - Good. You can give us the low-down on the way over. Here. Oh, thanks. Oh Bruce, I couldn't sleep any longer. Is there anything new? Oh, excuse me. This is Mr Parks and Mr Perrin of the New York Globe. Miss Antoinette Martin of The courier. - Charmed. Oh Mr Parks, I'm very glad to .. So they raise orchids up here too, eh? Look after things for a while, will you Toni. I'll take the boys over to the hotel. Why sure she will. And we're the thing she'll look after. We're just going over to a sip little breakfast, Miss Martin. And all members of the press are invited. Oh, I couldn't. She's probably eaten at this hotel before. Surely Miss Martin, you'll help a couple of out-of-town boys get on to the ropes? Sure, come on along, Toni. You can help me tell them the details. Alright. I want a nice sunny room with a southern exposure and a bed. Yes, sir. Hello Perrin. - Hi, fellah. How about this fellow Judd Brooks? Is he married? - Yeah. Got a wife and kid. He works in our bank. Oh, plays around, eh? Oh no. Folks in a small town to a lot of talking. Yeah, well married men who play around don't usually find much except trouble. And that's what we call "expert opinion". Hello Ken. Allow me to present the eminent Mr Jigger Bolton. Of The New York Bulletin. Miss Martin, the local talent and .. Mr Foster, her city editor. You know Miss Martin, we must depend on you a lot to can show us the ropes. I'll be glad to do all I can. Now, don't promise anything until you've known him better. Look out, here comes Maizie. Hello Maizie. - Hello Maizie. Hello, boys. Well, I didn't know you were going to be on this job. So I see. You know if I didn't know you as well as I do, Maizie, I might .. Suspect that was a crack. Meet the local press. Miss Martin and Mr Foster of The Courier. Miss Dickson and Mr Works of The Star. How do you do. - How do you do. You have been in town at least an hour, haven't you, bob. Say, better give us a whole floor. There is a gang coming from town. - Yes, sir. I'll let you do the outside work, Toni. You tag along with them while I'm busy. If they'll let you. Alright. I guess we're all set here. The next thing is a little work on that Ferguson dame. She? She's in jail. Well then, that means a little work on the Sheriff. Of course you know him don't you? Well you can help us. Come on. Let's go. Front. Front. Front. Front. Front. Front? What do you mean "Front"? Quiet, will you. Front. Did you call me, sir? Yes, take those bags upstairs, boy. Yes, sir. Mrs Ferguson, did you and your husband fight much? We almost never quarrelled. We were very happy. But you did have a row with him last night, didn't you? Yes. We disagreed about something. Something called Judd Brooks? Not at all. Mr Brooks name just happened to come into it. In what way? - That's not your business. No. That's monkey business. Wasn't Brooks the man your husband had the row with after dinner? No. - Who was it then? I can't tell you. Couldn't we make it a bit later when she's not so upset? You keep out of this. I know what I'm doing. Come on lady, who was the man and what was the fight about? I can't tell you. It was about Mr Ferguson's business affairs. You sure it wasn't about Mrs Ferguson's love affairs? That's enough of that, Parks. Stop it. I wish you to go over your story again, Mrs Ferguson. Mr Middleton, can't you make them stop? Well, they're only doing what I'd have to do. If they didn't. I assure you. My friendship with Mrs Ferguson had nothing to do with this. We're merely old friends. Mr Ferguson knew that. Knew it so well he made an extra trip up here to see how the friendship was going? No, no, no. Nothing of the kind. - Then why did they quarrel about you? They couldn't have been. - The maid said differently. You mustn't pay any attention to that. Oh no, of course we won't. We're just simple newspaper people who like to hear folks talk. Yeah. Whatever we hear just goes in one ear and .. Comes out through the typewriter. Oh you mustn't. You can't print anything like that. You don't realise the position I'm in. Of course we do. Why do you think we're letting you waste your time like this? But there is nothing I can tell you. - Maybe his wife can tell us something? No, no, no. Please, please. - Oh, it's like that, is it? I trust you will be very careful about what you allow to be published. You mean, be sure and get the names spelled right? But we must protect the bank. Any adverse publicity for Mr Brooks .. Might react disastrously with our depositors. May we quote you to that effect? I don't see how that will interest your readers. But it will interest this whole town. Our only industry is the overall factory and that depends upon the bank. Any lack of confidence would be disastrous. Disastrous. Well, let's hope Mr Brooks has kept his nose clean. Hold it, Bob. Well, what do you think? Listen, any time they start with someone bound and gagged. I'll lay 10-1 it's a phony without hearing another crack. Sure. Think Brooks did it? - Who else? He had every reason to. That's our line for keeping the story alive isn't it? - Okay with me. And if she and Brooks didn't do it, well the facts are bound to come out. That will be another story. - Sure. There is only one thing. I didn't like the way old Collins of The American butted in. Did you notice him? Just as I had her going good. Did I? "I wish you'd just go over your story again, Mrs Ferguson". I could have clipped him right on the snozzle. We got to watch him. And that long-faced goat from The Times. What's his name? Frowdy, Frank Frowdy. And Joe Blakely and Claude Wright. Those old fluffs are a million years behind the times. They are still writing with quill pens. - Well, we can't get rid of them. But we mustn't let them gum us up, either. Just watch them. That's all. Come on. I never saw anything like it. The nerve of a guy like that. Well, is this a dump. - Hi there. - Hello. You never can tell with these small Burghs. How goes it, Marty? Old Parks tried to take it over again. - Take it over? Yep. He pushed the Sheriff out of the way and started in. He's got Perrin with him and of course Jigger Bolton and all that crew. What, after the mess they made of the Marks poison case? Sure, those guys will never learn. Yeah, well I'm off them. I strung along with that scandal sheet crowd the last time. Nearly got me into a libel suit. I had to be beg like a dog to keep my job. Never again. Right, kid. I'm going to get enough oil on board someday .. And knock that guy Park's ears off, just for luck. But listen boys. It's serious. We knew Parks, Perrin and Jigger Bolton were high-siding us from the word go. They'd lie and steal and crucify their own grandmothers to make a story. But just the same, in this case they might be right. Yeah? Well right or wrong they can get us into plenty of hot water. With our bosses. Now look. We'll handle this case as news. Straight news. But I'll trail Parks and his crowd to see what they're doing. Then we'll meet here every night to see what's what. Is it agreed? Sure. - Fine. Well I'd better make it earlier. - Right. I go to press at 8 o'clock. You see that pig woman, kid. You've got an honest face. She may talk for you. George. Old sheriff square-jaw probably never heard of fingerprints. Couldn't you get Inspector Dougherty to run up here? On the QT, and do a good job on that jimmied window? That's an idea. Hanley, you're a golfer. You get a car to the Cornwall Country Club. If there is any gossip, you'll get it there. And you, Lane. Run around to that place they were talking about earlier in the day. Wait a second. Hold it. Let's get a good pose now. No, that's no good. See if you can't get something with a lot of action in it. Now, I know. The charge to the jury. That's great. Wait a minute. Let's fix your tie. Alright, Mike. Shoot it. Fine. - That was swell. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. But I can't have Judd Brooks arrested. Why not? You are the County Attorney around here, aren't you? But what for? - What for? Must we come all the way from New York to show you how to run your tiny office? Sure we do. They haven't heard about legal procedure yet. But what charge can I make? - Now look here, Jeffries. That fellow Brooks is in this up to his neck. Are you sure of that? - We know it. And the least you can do is hold him as a material witness. He won't run away. - Oh no? Suppose we told you we have information that he plans to elope to South America. With Mrs Ferguson. You're going to print that? We can't print it if you stop it. - But it's nonsense. He's not that kind. - Yeah. Does it take any particular "kind" to go daffy over a prettier woman? And he's a poor man. - Poor? With his fingers in that bank vault? Good heavens, man. You're not going to start a scandal about the bank? Why .. No, we don't start things. We only report them after they happen. And things are going to happen plenty around the Burgh. But if I arrest him the depositors will think .. they will .. You represent the people, not the bank, don't you? You think a New York district attorney would let a valuable witness get away? Just because some bank didn't want him pinched. No, I .. I suppose not. I guess you gentlemen are right. I'll get hold of the Sheriff. Now you're talking. - That's fine. There's the story, boss. That'll give us a lead .. - Tomorrow's story. Find out where Judd Brooks' wife lives and meet me at the hotel. You want us to go after the District Attorney? - No thanks. Find out where Mrs Brooks lives and meet her at the hotel. Where is Toni? - Why, she ought to be in pretty soon. Well. Maybe I'd better read copy for you for a while, eh? Alright, fine Dad. You know, I couldn't get any real booze in this little town. So I had to take the stuff I could get from the drugstore. Come and get it. I don't know whether that will be any good. It's hard to get the right ingredients in a little town like this. Hmm. I think it's lovely. - Yeah, that's his one real talent. He can make a Martini out of cockroach paste and turpentine. No, that's a Manhattan. A Martini is boiled cigar butts and sheep dip. [ Door knocks ] Who's that? - Brother Perrin. In what is laughingly known as the flesh. Are the Perrin dues all paid up? Paid up as a life member, sir. - What's the password, brother? Well, the password Parks is this. The Brooks family have been found .. Ensconced in a bungalow four vacant lots south of the Methodist Episcopal Church. And when can we find the lady at home? - She's there practically all the time. Hey, Works. - Yeah? - You'd better hold that story. As we've new lead for tomorrow's story. - Oh yeah? Yeah. Young Brooks over at the bank will be arrested late tonight. But early enough for the late edition. Judd Brooks arrested? - Uhuh. Did you ask the Sheriff when he'll pull it? Can't get a thing out of him. He needs softening up. I fear your local officials haven't been properly trained. What do you mean? We print all the news he give us. Yes, but you don't inform him of what news to give you. Did you try giving him a couple of lumps of sugar? I tried, but he seems to be one limb of the law that's not susceptible to sugar. Jesus, this is as good as the school of journalism for me. Better. No school of journalism ever taught you to put your foot in the crack of a door. Oh, are you sending me home? - No. I see that you're hungry. - Oh no. - Oh yes. I just sent downstairs for some sandwiches. Miss Martin is my guest. She does not eat sandwiches. Oh, you mean you are taking me out to dinner? I crave that honor, my lady. - Well. Well, goodbye all. - Goodbye. Goodbye. I will .. see you later gentlemen. You know, Toni. I like you. Lots. You are a pretty swell person. You're .. Well, you are genuine. That's why I want us to be friends. That's rather rare between men and women. Friendship. Toni, there is only real basis for friendship. So before you even decide whether or not you want me for a friend. I want you to know just exactly what kind of a mug I am. Well, I'm hardly qualified to criticise an absent brother. But this is one time when Mr Parks ought to be ashamed of himself. Why, she's just a punk kid. - Yeah. Hello Maizie. - Hi, beautiful. Beautiful is looking for Bob Parks and Beautiful is getting a trifle annoyed. Bob just went out to get a bite to eat. Yeah, just a little while ago. Would it be any violation of your professional ethics .. To tell me whether or not that "bite to eat" looked appetising? Sure-shot Maizie, they calls her. Well, if you ask me I wouldn't mind sitting down to a .. Dish of it. In the first place I'm what's laughingly known as a chronic alcoholic. Oh, I seldom develop the yellow-spotted staggers. And I can talk at all times but .. I do get awfully drunk now and then. And it is more often now than then. Well you have to drink to keep up such a terrific pace, I guess. No, it's more than that. A drunkard never gets a day off. He's up for life. And in the second place, I'm pretty moody. Sometimes, I'm way up high. And on others I'm so low that I have stand on tiptoe to reach bottom. When I'm like that I'm bad news for my friends. They take an awful beating then because .. Well, I say a lot of biting, nasty things. Things that I don't mean but .. That sound good while I'm saying them. Well, a real friend would understand. And in the third place. I have a very definite weakness for your charming sex. Some of them have made an awful chump out of me and .. Some of them I've treated pretty badly. It might have been different if I'd met the one right one but .. But there isn't very much I could do about it if did. You see Toni, I'm married. I have been ever since I was a kid of twenty. Oh we keep a pretence of marriage, but that's about all. She in pretty much of an invalid. It would be like hitting her with an ax to ask her to divorce me. Oh, hello Maizie. - Hello, Bob. Sit down, Maizie. We were just .. Hmm. Be nonchalant. Light up. You know Miss Martin of The Courier? Yes, I know Miss Martin of The Courier. And I also know Anna Resnick and Helen Ward of The Despatch. In fact I know quite a number of your friends, Bob. Well, I was just telling Miss Martin .. Well, don't let me interrupt the ritual. Bob seems to be choking on a piece of steak. If you want to know the rest of that, let me tell you. I know it from memory. Let me see. Where were you? Oh yeah, I know. "It would be like hitting her on the head with an ax to ask for a divorce." Will you please excuse me? It's getting close to my deadline and I think I'd better run along. Feel kind of cheap? What do you think? Well if you don't, you're going to, Mr Parks. I'm sick of having you shove me around. And I'm going to give you a man-sized earful right now. Hello, Toni. Hello. What's new, sweetheart? Got a good lead for tomorrow? Not yet. No? Parks said there would be something sensational later tonight. Anyhow, cheer up. Well, if you want something sensational. Why don't you do like they do? Go out and get it. What's the matter, Toni? Oh, noting. I'm tired. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I shouldn't be making you do all this running around. Oh, please. The office isn't the place for that kind of stuff. No .. I guess not. Only. The office is the only place I seem to see you nowadays. Here is something I promised the Sheriff I'd print with the main story. Thanks, Bruce. That was nice of you. Someday I'll run into the old monger and say: Mr Whiteside, here's my resignation. And smack him right where he parks his whiskers. Hit him again for me, Mike. He fired me off The Mail for yelling "Hey you" at the Prince of Wales. He said it wasn't dignified. Ha. A paper can't have dignity and pictures both. Is this the dame? Oh, good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Are you Mrs Brooks? Yes. Is your husband at home? - No. He's still at the bank. Oh. Well, there are a few things that we want to ask you about. I'm Mr Parks of The New York Globe. And this is Mr Perrin, my associate. How are you. - How do you do. Well, couldn't you see my husband down at the bank? No, not at the bank. I wish you would. You see .. I'm not very well just now. We won't bother you more than a few minutes. Look, Mrs Brooks. All we want to know is what time your husband got home .. On the night Ferguson was murdered. Why. I don't remember. - Was he home at all? Oh of course. He worked a while at the bank. How do you know he was at the bank? Why, he got a telephone call and said he had to go down there for a while. Yeah, but how do you know that's where he went? Where else would he be? That's what we're trying to find out. He doesn't seem very sure where he was himself. Are you quite sure he didn't go up to the Ferguson place? What do you mean? Didn't you know that Mr and Mrs Ferguson had quarrelled about your husband .. Before he was murdered? No. No, that's not true. We don't blame you for defending him. You got to do it to clear your own face. You come clean with us and give us the low-down and .. Well, we'll make it as easy for you as we can. Well, I don't know what you mean. Were you thinking of divorcing Brooks? - Divorcing him? Why, no! You might as well tell us everything, Mrs Brooks. But there is nothing to tell. Why, my husband and Mrs Ferguson were just .. Well. Anybody in this town will tell you the kind of a man Judd Brooks is. Yeah .. that's probably the reason they arrested him. Arrested him? Arrested him? - Half an hour ago. Now maybe you'll tell us what we want to know. Look out. She's fainted. Run in and call an ambulance. - There's no ambulance in this town. Then get a doctor, quick. - Right. What have you been doing to her? What's the matter? What's the matter? - She's fainted. She must be sick. Sick? She is going to have a baby. I still think you're getting too much ink on your rollers, Joe. A nice looking job for the plant you got here. Thanks, Mr Collins. Why, this is practically a masterpiece. Compared to some of the messes I used to commit. Say, how did you get your first job in New York? Luck. I happened to get inside the Old World city room just as a fellow was quitting. I don't know whether that was good luck or bad. Why? Did you ever wish you weren't a newspaperman? Every now and then. Particularly after a shabby piece of business .. Like that interview with Mrs Brooks this afternoon. No. I suppose I never have really wanted to get out. I had chances, too. You see Bruce, this newspapering is a strange business. Grocers for instance, sell dried apples. And dry goods merchants sell gingham. But we are selling two intangible commodities. One is news and the other is public service. It's pretty hard sometimes to tell whether a story is news .. Or just plain snooping into people's private affairs. That's when you get disgusted. Then you go out and do something that you know is a public service. You dig up some story about a ship sinking .. Because her owners sent her to sea without repairs. And you put the guilty men in jail. Or write of conditions in the coalfields and force Congress to investigate. Somehow. It happens that every time the spell wears a bit thin. We get a fresh injection of public service. And then we carry on. And after this. I need a mighty big shot. Yeah, hello? Well Jeffries, you sent for us. Yes, I have a bit of news for you. Attaboy, Jeffries. I am going to release Mrs Ferguson. Release her? What for? Why not? I am reasonably certain that she is innocent. And you call that news? Why yes. - Well this is a surprise. You could knock me over with a locomotive. I thought you'd be surprised. Are you kidding us? No, not at all. Then let me give you some news. The story my paper will print .. Is that Cornwall County's Prosecutor is afraid to act against wealthy criminals. What's that? She's no criminal. No? You mean to say you're daft enough to swallow that baloney .. About a burglar coming in, tying her and stealing her ring? But she was tied up. She couldn't have done that herself. Somebody else was there. - Of course somebody else was there. She had help. And you know who it was just as well as we do. But I don't. I got no proof. No proof? Listen, Jeffries. We've been here before. Seen timid officials try to crawl out of their duty like this too many times. But .. You are going to let this murderess go free. Just because she happens to be a big frog in this little puddle. You are giving us news. More news than you think. Yeah. And we'll print it. In the morning. And don't say you haven't got proof. There's a smart dame. She thinks you're a hick lawyer she can play leapfrog with and make you like it. She and her boyfriend Brooks are giving you the horse-laugh right now. Very soon we'll get tired of showing you what you should have learned in school. But I will do you this one favor. Now here is your case. One that a jury of girl scouts could understand. Brooks and the dame are set to beat it. The old man gets suspicious. And comes back from New York when he's not expected. After dinner, he blows up. Let's her have it. Tells her he knows all about it. Annie Murphin, the housemaid, said she heard the row. Heard Brooks' name mentioned. Naturally Mrs Ferguson denies it. So they fight a while longer. And then they phone Brooks to come out to the house and face a showdown. But we don't know that. We know he got a call at home, told his wife he must go to the bank for a while. Isn't that so? Yes. But .. - Alright then. So Brooks goes to the Fergusons. There is a fight between the two men. In the excitement, Ferguson is shot. They wonder what to do. But they are both smart. They had to be smart to get away with an affair so long in this one-horse town. They decide the only out is to try to make it look like a robbery. So, they smash a few things, hide Mrs Ferguson's jewellery. Oh, by the way. You ought to search Brooks' house for that stuff. Finally, Brooks cuts the wires and ties her up. Then he scrams through the windows and runs across the fields to the lane. You got that pair of lovers and the pig woman to back you up on that. But they only saw a man. They can't swear that it was Judd Brooks. They said he looked like Brooks, didn't they? They said he was Brooks' size and build, didn't they? They said he wore a brown hat like Brooks always wore, didn't they? Well, then? Well then, ain't that enough for anybody? Well. Oh, it could have been done that way. Could have been? I've known Judd Brooks for years. And I suppose you're going to let him off? Alright. Do it. It'll make good enough news. - Sure. Come on, boys. Now wait a minute. Now wait a minute, boys. Wait. Now boys .. Now I haven't said that I won't try her. Maybe I can make out a case. But if I do. You boys have got to stick to me. Chief, we're with you. We're with you. Well, what do you want? I want you and Mrs Ferguson to tell me everything that happened that night. Every little detail. Do I have to go over it all again? Hasn't there been enough about us in the newspapers? This isn't for publication. See, Mr Collins of the New York American had an idea for a new angle on the case. And I'm advising you, ma'am. Do as Bruce asks you. Mrs Ferguson. You said something about two men climbing in through a back window. Can you describe them in detail? Yes, I saw them plainly. I went into the bedroom downstairs. Order in the court. Now Mrs Ferguson, how long have you known Judd Brooks? All my life. Practically. It's true isn't it .. That you were engaged to him before you married Mr Ferguson? Objection! Objection overruled. - Exception! Exception noted. Come no Mrs Ferguson. The court rules that you must answer the question. Yes or no? No. But it is true isn't it, that you had some sort of a .. Understanding between you? Our families thought .. Oh, your families thought you that were engaged? Is that it? Not exactly. That is .. - Your Honor. I object to the manner in which the Prosecutor is badgering this witness. The court sees nothing objectionable about it. The witness is quite obviously evasive. Oh, hello Maizie. Come in. Try and keep me out. Good afternoon, Miss Dickson. Who says it's a good afternoon. I guess you people know there is a murder trial going on in town? You ever stop to figure how many stories Jim Perrin has written with your byline? Jim has only written three or four hundred for me. Tommy Crandall has written a lot more than that. I guess you see having those slugs write your stories is not doing you any good? You'll get canned and no decent newspaper will hire you. I remember saying that to you before. Only for the last three or four years. To be exact. Four years and three months. Really? I didn't realize it was so long. Yeah. It was just before I bobbed my hair. Are these yours? No. Oh no? Well alright then. Yes. Tuck in your hair and get out of here and stay out! I won't and you can't make me. Now look here, Maizie. What's the use of making a scene? You and I have known for months that we might as well saw it off. Surely, you have enough pride not to .. So he wants to take you to New York, huh? Why, you sit down and listen to me. Suppose he does take you to Broadway. You'd have a swell time. For a while anyway. He's a good teacher. One of the very best. He'll teach you how to breathe nightclub air. How to drink neat Rye without making a face. How to mix 18 different cocktails and take care of crying drunks. You'll learn to let the men do the work for you. And find out some of them won't do it for nothing. He'll teach how to steal pictures and how to chisel on your expense account. He'll introduce you to all the hot-spot hostesses and speakeasy junkies. You'll learn how to stall off bills for the clothes .. That looked so swell before drinks got spilled on them. Then one morning you'll wake up with a hangover six times bigger than Texas. And you'll wonder if there is one good reason why you should go on living. Then you take three drinks and you don't give a hoot. For the first few months you'll be that cute little Martin kid. After that you'll be known to the trade as "good old Toni". From then on you're the tough girl from The Globe or the speakeasy sob-sister. And when you add it all up it's got a minus sign in front of it. And bears a close resemblance to Bob Parks. Broadway's buddy. The nice thing is you have so many things to repent when you're older. And time grows heavy. Oh, it's just sour grapes with you because I'm younger. Tell her how much younger, Bob. Maizie is only 20. And you're 21 or 22 right now. Think about what 5 or 6 years in this racket will do to your face. Then tell me I'm lying to you. It wouldn't do that to me. Why, I'd have more strength of character. Okay. You win. Welcome to the sobbing sisterhood. I'll send your membership card in the mail. Try to treat this one a little straighter, Bob. She seems like a nice kid. Come in. Oh, hello kid. Park yourself somewhere. Say, I found this outside your door. Oh, well. I don't think the bootlegger dropped it and he's been my only visitor so far. I thought maybe you were sick so I came to tell you the line-up for tomorrow. Oh, thanks. I've had a touch of grippe and .. I played hooky. Say, you ought to take care of yourself. There is a lot of it around. - Yeah. Yeah. Toni phoned me this morning and said she wasn't feeling well either. That's too bad. Well, how was the trial today? The defence rested. I guess it goes to jury tomorrow afternoon. Do you think they'll convict her of first degree? Looks that way. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Hello Parky. Hello you unwashed hyenas. - Hello Parksy, old boy. How was the hunting today? Not bad. Jeffries got her crying. That guy has got a talent for being nasty, the little runt. I'd liked to have socked him right square on the nose. Oh no. It's against the rules to hit a guy on your own team. There you go, Parks. There you are, kid. - Thanks. That county attorney buzzard asked me to write his speech to the jury for him. Yeah. I bet that will be a bloodthirsty masterpiece. You're going to him howling like a wolf. Well, I guess I'd better be going. I'll see you later maybe, huh? - Sure. Drop in. Since the trial is almost over I think I'll throw a little party. Alright. So long, Kid. Here kid, your .. Thanks. Oh. Hello, Mr Foster. Hello, Miss Dickson. I wonder if you'd lend me a typewriter for some last minute work? - Sure. That madhouse up at the hotel is no place for a working newspaperwoman. That is, if she wants to work. - I wondered how you got anything done. Take that one. Thanks. Ah, this is Miss Martin's isn't it. Uhuh. Won't she be needing it? Well, not for a while anyway. You see. Miss Martin isn't doing much work in the office just now. No? Where is she doing her best work at the moment? Well, I let her do most of the outside work while you folks are in town. Sort-of taking care of the writing end myself. You see, Toni is a pretty good mixer. She gets around. Makes a lot of friends. Yeah, that does brighten things up a lot, doesn't it? Those girls with that friendly feeling. So I've heard. Are you trying to make a crack? - No, no, no. Well, I was. I thought you might need it. Oh, is that a hint? Have I been neglecting myself? Not that. I .. well, I mean. Well I thought someone in the rest of the crowd might recognise it. Well, it's yours, isn't it? - Nope. Mine all bear the mark of the Bellevue Laundry. Which is three oval holes with a 2-inch tear. Besides. I never use Ybry. You never use .. what? Ybry. It's a perfume from Paris. I'm surprised they have it here. I did not know they sold it north of Albany. Ybry. Are you sure of that? - Sure I'm sure. No. Toni is .. she's not at home. I guess she must be working. Anyhow, she's not here. Thanks. Bruce. Bruce. Is there anybody knows about it except Mr Collins? Not a soul. Then I tell you what we'll do. Yes? No, no. Buy at 6-7 thousand. Yes. The New York Express. Come on. Make it snappy, will you please. Hey, Joe. - Joe. Copy. Good work, boy. Good work. "Ah dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair?" "Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous .." "And the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?" "For fear of that I still will stay with thee .." "And never from this palace of dim night depart again." "Here, here will I remain." Will those hyenas ever stop howling? He howls best who howls last. Well, I think I'll go over and see the fun. Okay. Give me a break will you. Pipe down, fellahs. I got to work. Light a little cigarette. [ Singing: ] "When Irish eyes are smiling." "Sure, it's like a morning spring." "In the lilt of Irish laughter." "You can hear the angels sing." "When Irish hearts are happy." "All the world is bright and gay." "For when Irish eyes are smiling." "Sure, they steal your heart .." "Away." All you got to do is give it to them right and that jury will swoon. I bet I never heard an oratorio like that before. Just get right up in front of them. Face them. Say: "Gentlemen, I promise you". "The state shall not be satisfied with punishing this woman." "If you do your duty as you have sworn to do." "The state shall proceed at once to exact the full penalty of the law." "From her paramour." "Her partner and fellow in this hideous and revolting crime." Boy, that will smack them over, huh? You should be a lawyer. And when you hit that high spot at the end, you know .. Where you say to the jury .. "The state does not ask you .." "To condemn this woman to be executed for the murder of her husband." "The state demands it." When you hit that spot, you grab your collar, see, and rip it off like that. Don't have it buttoned at the back so you can get it off, see. With the collar in your hand, smack the table and yell as loud as you can: "As ye live." "So shall ye die!" What will I do with the tie? Forget it. Blood has been shed. Innocent blood. A life has been taken. And the penalty must equal the crime. Perrin is right, Jeffries. The jury won't be out 15 minutes. Say, how long since a woman was executed in this state? The last one was in .. 1897. Get a story on it and I'll use it as a shirttail with my story of the verdict. You're a lucky little stiff. If this thing hadn't burst right under your nose .. And we hadn't come up here to show you what to do with it. You wouldn't have any more chance of being re-elected .. Than I have of being President of the WCCU. Extra! Extra! Extra paper! Extra! Extra. Extra paper! Extra paper. Extra. Extra. Extra. Extra paper. What's all this about? - I don't know. This is no time for kidding. Have you and that young Foster cooked up some .. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Mr Foster says you can have those with his compliments. Did you know about this? - No. Honestly I didn't. All I knew was Bruce was writing to police departments all over the country. But he wouldn't tell me why. - That double-crossing little squirt. Well, why didn't you find out what he was doing? I thought it was just some of his silliness. He probably went behind our back to sell this story to every paper in New York. I hope he has. He certainly has made monkeys out of this collection of brains and beauty. I hope he soaked them plenty for the story too. How come you didn't put out a nationwide police alarm about that missing ring? Why, you .. Why, you all said that she and .. Who is County Attorney around here? You or us? We didn't arrest her. We didn't indict her. We didn't try her for murder. Do you realise how close you've come to taking the life of an innocent woman? [ Telephone ] Hello. Yeah. Hey, Perrin. Hello? Yeah, boss? Well, we just didn't, that's all. Okay, I'll tell him. Okay. Well, that lousy little .. You know what Foster's done? He's called all our papers and gave them the story for nothing. And that's what's known in the old country as adding insult to injury. [ Telephone ] Hello. Yes. Bolton speaking. Ah gee, that's tough. Well, thanks for calling anyway. That was the hospital. Mrs Brooks died half an hour ago. Giving birth to a child. Well. Now that that's happened. I'm going to say a few well-chosen words. Oh, you are in a daze, naturally. But you're not so groggy you can't get this. This thing that's knocked the props out under you and set you down with a bump. Is nothing, more or less, than a bit of good, honest newspaper work. Yes. And done by a good, honest newspaperman. That kid on that little one-horse paper. Wasn't content to sit around and make news. He went out and got it. That is known as "reporting". Which you've grown too rotten and lazy to do. You don't know how to get news. If you can't buy it or steal it you have to make it up. I've known all evening that young Foster .. Was going to pop this story. I've known for three weeks. That he was after it. I sent the news to my paper. So did Joe Blakely. Claude Wright. And very other decent newspaperman in town. You may remember, Parks. I told you the story might not be in this town. And you said: "If it wasn't you'd be hanged if you'd go looking for it." I'm glad he had the guts to shove it down your throat. You know. You've not only smashed the lives of several innocent people. And wrecked a whole community. You've come close to wrecking the profession that gives you your living. Don't worry. You can't do it. Crooked bankers haven't wrecked the banking business. And crooked politicians haven't torn down the government. There aren't enough of them and there aren't enough of you. The newspaper business got along honorably without you for years. And it's going to get along without you from now on. Why, you've completely forgotten that a newspaper just mirrors public events. The press is no more responsible for what happens .. Than the mirror is responsible for Mrs McGuinness's pug nose. What you've been doing is to add a few warts to Mrs McGuinness's nose. So she'll get mad and smash the mirror. I'll see this through if I have to go to every newspaper publisher in New York. And tell him the truth about you. Here .. paste that story in your clipping books. And hope to heaven you'll do as good a job someday. I think .. you are the man I want. You're Parks, aren't you? Yeah. Parks of The Globe. I want to talk to you a moment. Why .. certainly. Go ahead. Outside. Okay. Well, what is it? I haven't much time. I want to talk to you downstairs. - Yes. Oh, now look here. We've heard about your wife. - Downstairs. Out back. Through that door. Hey, Parks. Parks! He's not there. He's gone. Do you suppose that mug ..? - I don't like the way he acted. Now don't get excited. Well, he did get a rough deal. And you can't tell what a guy like that will do. Now look here. This has gone far enough. - Go on. But what's it all about? You killed my wife. - What? Why that's absurd. I only asked her a few questions. You killed my wife. - Stop it. Take your hands out of your pockets. - You .. Hey! Hey, you seen anything of Mr Parks and that guy Brooks? No. Ain't they upstairs? - Up? What's coming off here? - That's what we want to know. Brooks came, took Parks. Looks like he had a gun. We don't know what happened. Say, Brooks' car is still outside. If you want me for this. I'll be home. Bob. - Bob, you alright? Hello, kid. - Hi. Good morning, Mr Collins. Hello Bruce. How are you? Hello kid. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. I mean that. That hand tossed the brick that knocked Jigger Bolton off The Bulletin payroll. When I get back to the office I expect to find that I've .. "Resigned", too. You may change your mind. If you do, just send me a wire and the job is yours. No thanks. I'm staying here. For keeps, I guess. - For heaven's sake, why? You'd go big in New York once you've learned your way around. No. I guess there's some things I never could learn. No .. don't give up. Look at me. I'm still learning. Hi. - Hello, Maizie. After you, Maizie. Lots of luck, Bob. What are you talking about? - I'm pulling out. I haven't got what it takes, I guess. - You mean ..? You mean you're going to stay here? Well, I'm going to stay somewhere. It's not going to be New York, I know. Well, that will be a terrible blow to Park Row. You boys try and bear up now, won't you. And think of me kindly. If you're not too busy looking for new jobs. Uhuh. Afraid to face your city editor, huh? - No. My conscience is clear. Let them understand that little Maizie died with her boots on. "All aboard!" "All aboard!" So long, Ma?zie. - So long. Good luck. Goodbye, kid. Bye, Maizie. - Bye. Oh Bob. Save a place for me. Save a place for me. Hurry up. Make them wait! Jump on that car. You don't want to leave that behind. And don't tell me there isn't a vacancy on The Cornwall Courier. You think you can handle the soc?ety news? Say, with my experience I could handle a boa constrictor. * steve d *
