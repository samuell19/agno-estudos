But she's in that glow somewhere. [MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY] [NOISE FROM OTHER ROOM] ISAAC: Get off of me! Leave me alone! Quiet down! ISAAC: Okay, then help me then! He's trying to pin me to the ground again. Trying!? No...no...I did pin you. See I...I always pin him because he never fights back. Guess what. I'm not going to fight back because all this wrestling is stupid anyways. Oh, really? What has gotten into you?! Will you stop! Hey. I'm just bored. Relax. You're always bored! Well yeah, all we do is go to church and pray and read the Bible, and go to more church. And plus he's always talking about judgment coming to America. What's that? Well, this is true if America doesn't turn to God. [SCOFFING] So...you agree with Pastor Daniel then? Yeah Yeah, see, I can't get into all of that. Yeah, to me everything looks like it is going to be alright. So... Hey. At least the concert will be fun, right? I bet Abel will sing. Aaah I saw that smile Okay guys, get out! I have work to do.

I can't believe he's right here up close and personal! Please calm down. I just never thought I'd be this close to him! I mean...you know they don't date. What? Yeah. Both Abel and Obadiah do not date. Why do you look so surprised? You don't date either. I know. So why don't you? I made a choice. I'm saving myself for someone...special. Someone I'm going to marry. Okay. We're all waiting for that guy... Hi. How can I...can I help you today? Hi. I'd like you to put the money in the bag and not say a word. I'm sorry...what? I said put the money in the bag!

Actually I'm about... -It's okay. I'll go with him. I'll call his family on the way. Are you sure? Yeah. You're the hero here tonight. Not me. I'll call you later, okay? Okay. [AMBULANCE SIREN BLARING] So I heard tonight was really successful. Tonight was incredible! I really wish I could have been there. Yeah.... Well, I was very proud of every single one of you. [DISHES CLINKING] Rachel...Rachel you were outstanding tonight. Wasn't she? She was. Thank you, Sir. It was okay. It was nothing compared to Abel. Thank you, Rachel. You did pretty well yourself. Mother, the food is just incredible. Thank you so much. So Abel, where's Obadiah? He's at the Eden. He loves to go there. Does he always hang out there this long? He does. He's closed the place down before. Why? Uh...it's just that I'm, uh... [PHONE RINGING] I'll get it. Is something wrong? [PHONE RINGING] Dad. Is something wrong? What? Honey...it's for you. Hello. This is Pastor Daniel. Uh Huh. [CRYING] What? Oh no. It's Obadiah. What happened? Can I put you on hold, please? Hi. How can I help you? I'm looking for Obadiah Benjamin. Looks like Room 1138. You'll need to hurry. Visiting hours are just about over. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Hi, um, I'm here to see Obadiah. Hey. Come in. I'm...not...interrupting anything? No. Not at all. Please. Come in. Uh...Juliet, this is my brother, Abel. Uh, Abel, this is Juliet, my hero. Uh, Um, how are, how are you feeling? Doing okay. I guess I owe you my thanks. Oh, no. I didn't do anything. So, um, let's hear your side of the story. Oh it was your brother who saved the day. [LAUGHING] Oh, yeah, some hero I turned out to be... ...sitting here with a bullet hole in my leg. [GIGGLES] Well, uh, got you this. Thanks, Juliet. I'm really glad you're doing okay. Uh...guess I'll see you tomorrow. ...Sure. Sounds good. Um...it was really nice to meet you. Um. Goodbye. Hey! Let me walk you out. Okay. [MUSIC PLAYING] You have an incredible brother. You were really brave. Oh, um. Thank you. Oh...um...my Mom... she's um... I'm sorry...I've gotta... I gotta go. 'Bye. NEWSCASTER: Our top story this morning is one of heroism and bravery. Police have now confirmed one in custody after an attempted robbery at the Eden Cafe. Obadiah Benjamin, brother of renowned music star Abel Benjamin, and local author, Juliet Oscar, were reported by witnesses as confronting the would-be thief as police arrived on the scene. "I have no regrets for what I did." Did you at any time fear for your life past that point? No. Why is that? Because my Savior, Jesus, was watching over me. And here's what the young author had to say... Mom, she's on. There are some people here tonight calling you a hero. Oh. No I'm, I'm no hero. I was... I was trying to do the right thing. As we reported earlier, the man is now in custody and being held without bail. That's enough of that. It's time to pray. Come on, Mom. How often do we get to see Jules on TV like that? Hopefully never again. But you know, I was just doing what Jesus would have had me do. [LAUGHING] What? Uh, nothing. No seriously. What are you guys staring at me for? Cause you are like, you are like a star, dude. Oh come on. Dude. No, seriously! You...you were able to get into his head and actually make him bend to your will. Whoa! Isaac, are you okay? I...I just don't want anyone else I love to die. Isaac, no one else is going to die. Ok? I'm fine...everything's fine. Okay, go ahead. Father, we thank you so much for your food that you give us tonight. We thank You for Your blessing our family and protection. We love You. In Jesus' Name. Amen. Hello. Hi and welcome to the Restaurant at the Oxford. Do you have a reservation? Actually, I don't. But I'm meeting a friend here. Not a problem. Just let me know if you need any help. Okay, great. Thank you. Hey, you made it! We were waiting for you before we ordered. We? Who is "we"? The man you refuse to date! Hey, Caleb. Hi. My name is Melissa and I'll be taking care of you today. Can I bring you something to drink? Iced tea with lemon, please. A water for me would be great. Thanks. Just a beer, please. I'll be right back with those. You are extremely difficult to get ahold of. Um...yeah. I...I've just been really busy lately. I'm sorry. That's for sure. Well if you're that concerned about me, you do know where to find me. Church? Uh...I don't think so. Heh, heh. Your Jesus...He doesn't want to see me there. Well, I mean like it or not, Jesus is the Savior of this world. He's looking out for all of us. You don't believe in Him? No. I'm an atheist! I don't want anything to do with that stuff about heaven and hell. Someday...you're going to come to Jesus for help. That will never happen. All I need is a cold beer [SLAPS TABLE] and a burger! It's as simple as that. You're welcome, everyone. Hi. Hi. Yes, you too. Thank you very much for coming. God bless you. God bless you. Hey, look at you. Look at you. You're just moving. [LAUGHTER] ...I almost caught it back there. Yeah, but you're doing good. You're doing good. You feeling better? I am. Yeah. I'm all right. God's taking care of us. Amen. Amen. Yeah. I know. Listen, I've got to go see John here for a minute, okay? Okay -So take care okay? I'll see you at the house. -Yeah. I'll see you. Goodbye. Hey John. Can I see you for a minute? You okay? Uh..Yeah. You just looked a little lost there. [GIGGLE] Hey! they let you out of the hospital pretty quickly! Yeah. I can't spend my days sitting in that bed. Let's just say I was very persuasive. Mm hmm. And we're just going to leave it at that? Yeah. [GIGGLE] Sis. Are we leaving soon?! Yeah. Just a minute, Jason. Come on! We need to go! What's your deal? Just relax, okay? Okay, I've got friends to meet soon. Okay? Places to go. And what friends are that important? Listen, I'm almost 18 years old! Okay? I don't have to tell you and Mom everything! It's called respect for your elders...Jason. Try it. Please. Not you, too, man. Oh yes. Me too. Jason! I have something to tell you. What?! God...has a plan in your life. Okay. He wants to... A plan? Yes. And His plan is better than yours. You just...tell me when I'm 18! All right? [CAR DOOR CLOSING] I am so sorry. That's...all right. We need to pray for him. What do you mean? I don't know how to describe it, but I... I see a black storm coming. Well, what...what can I do? I don't know exactly. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] Whoa! Thank you. Thank you! [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Who is it? Hello? I'm going to go get some water. You want some? Yeah. [PHONE RINGING] Hey Obie! [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi. My name is Mary. I...I believe you know my son. I was just answering for my brother Obadiah. Do you want me to go get him for you? Oh. Are you Abel Benjamin? Yeah. Can I help you? Oh, yeah, my son's a fan of yours. He really liked your... he liked your last movie. What's his name? Lawrence. He's in jail. I'm sorry. He wanted me to call Obadiah... ...to see if he would come visit him. He wants...he wants to apologize. For what? For shooting him. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Can I ask a favor? Yeah. It would...it would nice if... if you could go and see my son. Yeah. Where is he? [MUSIC PLAYING] You're Abel Benjamin. Hey, Lawrence. How are you? What are you doing here? I came to see you. [LAUGHING] Me? Yes. You. This is unbelievable. I almost killed your brother! It's OK. Your sins are forgiven. That's what the Bible says. That's just...hard to accept sometimes. God's love is real. Do you think that I could...still be saved? Yes. I know you can. You've got 10 minutes. I'm worried 'cause... everytime I look at you, I... ...I hear that voice...that ...that man screaming at me to break through this glass and strangle you! That voice is satan. And you have a choice to listen to him or to God. ...Satan is too strong for me. [CHOKING, DEMONIC NOISES] I want to kill you, Abel Benjamin! In the name of Jesus, set this boy free. What happened to me? Jesus set you free. I feel peace. I haven't felt like this in so long... God can give you everlasting peace. Would you like that? Would you like to ask Jesus into your heart? Yes. Hey Rachel. Hey, Abel! Could I ask you a question? Sure. What is it? What is worship? Well...worship... John chapter 4, verse 24, says that God is Spirit. And those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. So...when you worship God, you can meet Him. You can meet Him anywhere. So...you ready for practice? ...Oh yeah!... Hey. Is everything all right? No! Your brother's not home and it is almost midnight. Where do you suppose... Jason, what happened? Nothing! I'm fine! Jason you are not okay! Mom...I'm going to get your keys. We've got to take him to the hospital. No! No doctors. Are you crazy?! You're hurt! We need to call the police. No! Okay? No doctors. No police. All right, I...I'll tell you everything. Jason...what if you're hurt worse than we know?! I'm not, Mom! Okay? All right. Then tell us! I got drunk tonight. I've been drinking a lot lately. I've...I've been hanging out with my friends... everyday after school. What are you thinking?! Hey, they're no good! I know...Isaac. I know, okay? I just... It was just at first...at first I wanted to help them. ...they just dragged me down with them. [KNOCK AT THE DOOR] What? Good morning. Are you feeling any better? No! I just want everyone to leave me alone. Well I'm not going to leave you alone. You need to listen to what I have to say. You listen, Okay? [SIGH] Do you know why people like me always have problems? It's because people like you are always telling me how to live my life ...or telling me to listen. I'm sick of listening! I'm tired of it! Jason. [SIGH] Just...Just leave. (quietly) Jason... Just leave, Juliet! [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh...I love the way the cabin smells. Tell you what... I'm going to go unpack... and then I'm going to go ahead and make some sandwiches, okay? Okay. Sounds good. [MUSIC PLAYING] So to solve this equation, you are going to have to graph the vertex over the y-axis. [GUNFIRE] What's going on?! Now everything is okay. Don't worry about it. It sounds like somebody's shooting out there! Debbie, everything is fine. Stay in your seat. [GUNFIRE] Everyone back in your seats! Cops aren't here yet. Bring 'em in. Get in here! Hurry up! You two, pull out the chair! [SIRENS] Now! [SIRENS] Start tying up the teacher! [SIRENS] [SIRENS, DOGS BARKING] Where's your brother? Just please...stop. Are you telling us what to do now? Did you forget what happened to you the last time? You guys can't actually think any of this is right! Let Jesus in! Let Him take the anger out! Still running your stupid little mouth, huh? I'm sick of you! Listen, Michael. Stop. [GUNFIRE] I'm sick of everybody trying to tell me what to do. Even just this morning my Dad was trying to boss me around. Yeah. Yeah I know you have issues with your Dad. Don't talk about my Dad. Michael, Jesus... Jesus can take the pain away. [GUNFIRE] Waste 'em. [GUNFIRE] Why would you guys do this?! On your knees. No. Where's your God now, huh? He's here. He wants you to know that He sent Jesus on the cross so you could have a new life, Michael. Jesus loves you, Bro. I hate you. [GUNSHOT] [PHONE RINGING] I've got it. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yeah. Hold on. Yes? Jason?! No!!! [AMBULANCE SIREN] So...how's Rachel doing? What? Rachel. How is she? I don't know. I haven't talked to her recently. I thought you liked her. She's a good friend. That's about it. Well, I just know... Mom and Dad... are hoping that you two will uh... Well, no not hoping. More like expecting you two to...well...you know. What? Become a couple? I didn't know that. But, like I said... She's a good friend. That's about it. Well all I know is she's got a huge crush on you. I'm waiting for God to send me the right one. And when He does, I'll know. Sure you haven't missed it yet? Oh I'm sure. Come on. Is that all you've got? [NEWS PLAYING ON TV IN BACKGROUND] Hey...hey. Hold on. Juliet's little brother goes to that school. NEWSCASTER: At this time, we do not have any details regarding injuries or deaths. But as the information becomes available, we promise to bring it to you live. Oh no! 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27... 17 year old male. Gun shot wound to the left upper chest. We've got a pulse! Blood pressure cup! Check the X-rays. Forms ready. Get him ready for transport. Let's go! All right. Excuse me. Miss. Yes Sir? I'm looking for a patient. Name please. Oscar. Jason Oscar. Hey. I came as soon as I heard. Thank you for coming. I just... I don't know how something like this could happen. I can. Evil runs rampant. It took the poor souls that did this and left them beyond salvation. Hello. I'm Dr. Williams. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Is my son going to be okay? At this point in time, I honestly don't know. The bullet went deep into his chest, nearly piercing his heart. Another inch and he wouldn't have made it. He's a very lucky young man. He's blessed. God was watching out for him. I certainly hope so. Nonetheless... he's in need of another transfusion. He lost a considerable amount of blood. I'll give you whatever you need. I'm his twin, so... ...please just save my brother! Thank you. Come with me. Mom, I need to go get some air. Hello. I'm Chaplain Constant. Oh. Pleased to meet you. Hi. If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know. Please pray. I will. Dear Jesus, Please heal Jason. God please don't take him away from me. I just wanted to check on you, make sure everything's alright. I'm holding up. Of that I have no doubt. In the short time I've known you, I've quickly learned how strong you are. I certainly don't feel like it right now. You are, whether you know it or not. Thanks, Abel. We should go inside. It's going to rain soon. I can smell it in the air. [GASPING FOR AIR] Mom. Mom! It just hurts. Jason. Lay back down. You've been through so much! I remember...I remember everything. It was horrible. Jason, we don't need to hear about it right now, okay? It can wait. No! No. I can't. They put me on my knees. They asked me, "Where is your God now?" I'll be okay for now. Isaac, go get the nurse! Thank you. Thanks for not judging me. I made a lot of mistakes. This whole... this whole month I've been, I've been living a lie. I've done drugs, and alcohol...and pornography. It infected my soul. Jason, that's all over with now. You're forgiven. Please forgive me. I'd have been, I'd have been 18 in just a few weeks. I...I was praying, I was praying that when I turned 18, I'd have a new life. You will have a new life, Jason. A new life. Mom, Jules, Isaac, I see Dad. I see Jesus. They're waiting for me. No! Come back to me! It has been said that it's a dark day when parents have to lay their child to rest instead of them. It doesn't seem fair. Not even right. Why did God do this? Why not me instead? It also makes us think about our own faith and trust in God's Word and in His plan. Jesus said in John, chapter 14, verses 1 and 2, "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God. Trust also in Me." Today we are here to celebrate... surely a very cherished life and a very blessed life. But we are also here to mourn...how this life ended. Brothers and sisters, this is a sign of the times, indeed... when children take the lives of other children. Jason's loss reminds us of the suffering that we must all endure. Yet we should know that our brother, Jason Oscar, is not truly dead. No, he walks now with our Lord, Jesus Christ. And he dances through the fields of heaven. And while we say goodbye on earth today, it's... it's only for now. For the day will come when each and every one of us will see him once again. But until that day comes...we must continue. How could this happen? It's a real tragedy, Son. We must pray for his family. It just doesn't seem real to me. I know. I understand. Psalms 90 says the days of our lives are numbered... seventy to eighty years. What happened to him? Jesus probably wanted him in heaven for a great reason. [SIGHS] Abel. Antonio. Sorry I'm late. No problem. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! I have amazing news for you! Yeah? What is it? Yeah. The producer that I was working with has an offer that you cannot refuse. It's a lead role in his new movie. Yeah! And you know...it's based on Adam Spring's best seller. Yeah. The newest one. No. I don't want to do that. All of his movies are the same-- a fantastic love story that ends up in tragedy and revenge. I told you I only want to do movies that are hopeful and inspiring. You haven't even heard the offer. It's a lot of money, Abel. A lot of money! You know I don't care about that. God has always provided for me. You...you...you're hurting your career, Abel. For real. If those are the kind of roles I have to take to further my career, I am fine with it being at a standstill. Now can we eat? I still have to pack. Oh...yeah...that's right. I hear it's going to be a great show. Waitress! Can I have a drink? A real one! Not water. You want a drink? Aah, you don't drink. ...By Juliet Oscar [CROWD CHEERING] POLITICIAN: We must open our borders to other nations! ...to welcome other people and encourage free trade. [CROWD CHEERING] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMS OF PAIN] [GUNFIRE, BREAKING GLASS] You can't go out there! Are you kidding me?! They're killing people! Come on. Shoot! All of you! Come with me. [GUNFIRE, BREAKING GLASS] Stay here! [GUNFIRE, BREAKING GLASS, PEOPLE WAILING] They're taking them away! Stay here where it's safe! Please. Sir. [SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION OUTSIDE] Here. Let me help you clean up. [SWEEPING BROKEN GLASS] You should leave. You know, this happens so often in this town that nowhere is safe. That'll change soon...I promise. Murderers and monsters run free in the streets. I... I don't see how. God will bring change to your city. And there will be peace on your streets once again. All you have to do is pray. That's all? Pray? Yes. Pray and God will put love into their hearts. I will not pray! I...I'm sorry. This is lovely. You can have it. My gift to you. [ABEL SINGING AT CONCERT] Dad used to bring us here a lot when we were little. I don't remember him at all. You were really young. But he used to carry you and Jason in either arm. He was... He was so proud of you boys. Both of you. You know...thinking of Jason...it hurts. You know? Sometimes... Sometimes I just feel like giving up. I'm sorry. Abel. What a surprise! Did I call at a bad time? No! No...not at all! Were you writing? I was trying to. Ended up daydreaming. Well, I just got back from Manila last night. I just wanted to call and check in on you. Yeah...I'm, I'm hurting. But...I probably will be for a while. I understand. I really do. Just... keep your faith in God and He'll heal your wounds. I know, Abel. It's... really sweet of you to call and make sure that I'm okay. I also wanted to call and tell you I have a surprise for you. You do? You shouldn't have. Well I did. If you want to come down to the church Well...well okay, then. I...I'll be right down. All right. I can't wait. See you soon. Rachel, so happy that you are here. I hope you're staying because we have great plans for tonight. Good. I'm excited. [HAPPY CHATTER] Hey, Mom. Hey hi, Sweetie. How are you? Hey..Abel! You're back! Abel. Oh. Rachel. You can't say hello to me anymore? Sorry. Is that for me? Oh this? No. I'm sorry. So...no present for me and you didn't even invite me along? Listen...I was pressed for time. But maybe next time... ...you can come with me, okay? You weren't kidding about coming here. No. I'm a woman of my word. Indeed you are. Well...I hope you like what I brought you back. I'm sure I will... Abel... So you like it then? I didn't know if you would. Its gorgeous!. I love it. You really didn't have to do this. No, I did. You needed a reason to smile. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Juliet. I'm sorry. Caleb? I was wrong to judge you. And honestly, I started going to church. Really? Are...are you being serious? Absolutely! I read your book. It touched me in a way that I never thought possible. Her faith in God, through everything that she was going through... It really touched my heart. Wow. I don't, I don't know what to say. Juliet, I... I... I...I want to tell you... I love you. I always have. Uh...Mmm...Uh..Uh That's really sweet, Caleb. I love somebody else. He's gone!!!! Mom? Juliet, you are all I have left! Wha', what are you talking about? Isaac is gone! [ANGUISHED TEARS] Mom...I will find him! I will find him! Poor Juliet. I just got a phone call that her brother just...ran away. Ooh... I gotta help look for him. But where are you going to find him? I know some places I can look. Oh Jesus have mercy on Isaac. [MUSIC PLAYING] Abel. Look. Can we just park here? I've gotta take this. I'll just be a minute. That's the easiest shot. You still ain't going to make it. Heh. Yeah, right. Watch this... Seems like you have a staring problem. Yo. Yo. I'm sorry. It looked like you guys could...help me. Maybe. It's gonna cost you. How much? How much you got? If I give you guys 100 bucks, will that work? All right. That's cool. Who you looking for? This guy right here. Haven't seen him. Is he new? Let me see that. And who should I ask for when I call? It's Juliet. Rickie. Victor. It's nice to meet you. Hey! Isaac! Isaac. Thought you were somebody else. [PLAYS A COUPLE OF NOTES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] Did you forget about practice? I'm sorry. I forgot. We need to talk. About what? Never mind. Um. Let's get right to practice. Can we start with my favorite song? Yeah. That is not my favorite song, Abel. I've told you it a thousand times. I'll never let you go. Oh yeah. My mistake. Spirit of God...I come to worship You... I live to worship You. I live to love you. I live to love you. Rachel, what are you doing? I love you, Abel. I always have. I need to know if you love me. Rachel... You're like a little sister to me. I'm not your sister. I need you. I love somebody else. It's Juliet. Isn't it? [CRYING] What did you do to her? Nothing. Its just a misunderstanding. Yeah I've heard that before. What's wrong? Do you want to talk about it? Well if I tell you, you have to promise. You can't tell anyone. Yeah. Promise. Well...I...I...I'm pregnant. What? That's why I left home. I had to come here because my parents would never let me get an abortion. An abortion?! Are you crazy?! Don't you have any fear of God? I can't do this. Fear of God? I don't care! ...I can't have this baby! I thought that he loved me and that he was the one and that he was going to marry me, but he had another girl so so much for love. Don't have an abortion. God will help you. I will help you. Yo. Abel.. Sorry we're late, Bro. So you guys said you had news for me? Yeah, we do. I want to ask you something. Sure. What is it? Do you love Juliet? I bet you do. You lucky man... I don't call that luck. I call it blessed. What's your news? He's been hanging out over by 5280. He's pretty much been there every other night. He looks pitiful. What time is it. Time to eat? All right. Let's go get some food. It looks like they are going to be closing soon. I know. Maybe he switched places... I'm sorry Juliet. It's not your fault. We should probably just go home. Hey! Stop! You don't want to do this. You wanna die instead?! Gimme the knife, man. Stay out of this! This punk stole my rocks! You're going to kill him over drugs?! Please don't let him kill me. This ain't over yet! Thank You, Jesus, for saving my life! He gave you a second chance. Stop the drugs, man. Get right with God. We must intercede for our nation. We want to thank God. He has given our nation a second chance. Amen. The past year has been one of great change. But He will...send the latter rain. Gentlemen...Brothers...Let's pray. We are here to pray for our country. Our nation is about ready to go through a tremendous change. We must pray. Whatcha thinkin? Just concerned. Yeah. Me, too. Feels like something bad's going to happen. So you believe your father? Have you ever known him to be wrong? We should go back inside. Come on. [MISSILES OVERHEAD] PASTOR DANIEL: Disaster! Disaster! Disaster! Now if we do not turn to God, then judgment is surely on its way. Mom! Mom, we've got to go! [AIR RAID SIRENS] [POUNDING ON SHELTER DOOR] Abel! Abel come on! Abel, please! Listen, Juliet. Mom, go! I'm glad you're here, okay. Abel, I need to tell you something! Come on!!! [INDISTINCT SOUNDS] Dad! So glad you made it here! So glad you made it safely. Ladies and Gentlemen. This just in... This time we are now confirming a detonation in the greater Los Angeles area, roughly one hour ago Water? I don't want water! I want to know why this has happened to this country! I want to know why this has happened to us in America! Where's the President? [MANY VOICES] Yeah! President of the United States?! The person who has the power to stop this! Why is God doing this to this nation?! God didn't do this to this nation. We did. What? How?! what did we do? We have forsaken God. We turned away from God. [GUITAR STRUMMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. I've been looking for you. I've been worried. Why have you been worried? Because I care. You should really go inside. It's not safe out. Rachel, could you take her downstairs... to get this looked at? What's your name? Daisy. What's your name? My name is Rachel. Do you like bubblegum? Yeah. A detonation, followed by a sweeping attack across the United States, including Boston, New York, Chicago, Houston, and right here in Denver. At this time, we do not know who the attackers are, or who they are affiliated with, but the National Guard has been activated. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is advising everyone to stay in their homes or find a private residence or shelter that is well stocked. I'm sorry. We don't have more for you at this time. But I promise, we will bring you the news as it comes. Hey. Are you sure you want to do this alone? I have to go find my brother! I have to! I understand. Just call me the instant you need anything and I'll be there. I know. We will find your brother. I promise. Thank you. My fellow Americans. I come to you tonight to bring positive news into your homes. Those who have chosen to attack the United States of America are being dealt with swift justice. As we speak, our armies are pushing back the enemy who chose to step on our soil. While this war moves towards victory, a state of emergency still exists. Isaac! Isaac! Please Isaac! Can you help me?! -I'm sorry. I can't. I didn't do anything, but please help me. Please! -Buy yourself some food alright? Please just go. Isaac no! You have to come home with me. I can't go home yet. I'm a mess. OK? I need time to clean up. Besides... I'll go home when I'm ready. Whatever you are looking for, it isn't here. Look around you. Nothing is going to change. It's only going to get worse. I can't go home. This is God's fault! This is His fault that Jason and Dad are gone! No. God didn't do this. The devil did. He steals and kills. But why does He let me suffer so much? Isaac... it's you that brought on the suffering. I mean, ever since you turned your back on God, you have been... starving and hurting You just need to come home. Could you forgive me? Isaac of course I forgive you. Let's go home. BISHOP PORTER: We want to thank God. He has given our nation a second chance. The past year has been one of great change. But He will...send the latter rain. Oh, please don't stop. That was lovely.
