- I don't want to scare anyone but, I'm gonna give it to you straight about Bigfoot. The locals will tell you that he lives out here. Some kind of demented creature. Stalking, living off of wild game and vegetation. Some claim they've even seen him, right here in this area. Bigfoot's out there. Waiting. Always on the hunt for intruders. Looking to kill, to devour. Thirsty for blood. Aah! - Okay everyone, try to get some sleep tonight, we've got a big climb tomorrow. We're on the trail at 4.30, so, try not to get too shitty tonight. Especially you Sam. - Perfect place, perfect time. - Doesn't get much better than that. - Mm mm. We'll be needing this. - Hey. Hmm? - No. - Double-fisting again. - Oh yeah. - Bow chicka-wow-wow. - That sounded like Alex. - They're just messing with us. Come here. - No, you need to go check that out. - It's cold out there. - It can get cold in here. - Gotcha. All right babe, I'll be right back. - Oh Steve. - It's Chris. - Whatever. - Who's Steve. Mm, shh. - Nick! Nick! This isn't funny. - Oh yeah. Oh please God! Now, some breaking news in the story of the hiking expedition that went missing in southwest Colorado last month. Search teams have recovered two additional bodies, bringing the total number to five. Authorities report no sign of Alex Barnes, the remaining missing hiker. The remains show signs of trauma and animal scavenging. The medical examiner has not released the cause of death for any of the recovered bodies. Leading to speculation about the mysterious circumstances surrounding this incident. Today we're announcing that after six weeks with no sign of Miss Barnes, we're officially suspending our search efforts. This just in, exclusive drone footage that sheds new light on this tragedy revealing grisly details about the group's final moments. Warning, this footage is graphic and may be disturbing to some viewers. The footage shows-- A bear was seen wandering through the campsite-- Believed to be a rabid bear-- In a horrific attack. A gruesome campsite. Mangled, destroyed hiking-- The extremely remote location. What some are calling the Mountaineering Massacre. Mountaineering Massacre. Mountaineering Massacre. They were college students on fall break. On a camping trip gone terribly wrong. Shocking to even seasoned search and rescue personnel. Found the scene horrifying. Up next, how to protect your family from an animal attack. Let's go the phone lines, caller one, what do you think about these idiots? No respect for the land. They got what was coming to 'em. And we're out. Back in two people, thank you. - Sir, excuse me. Excuse me sir. Sir. - I'm busy Paxton. What do you want? - Your network's been getting a lot of play on that bear attack clip, right? I got a guy who says he can prove no way it was a bear. Here's the twist. I want to make a show proving the existence of Bigfoot. - Are you really this desperate? - Every hoax that hits the news plays for weeks. People are still watching that grainy 16 millimeter footage from 1967. People love this stuff. Roger, there is an opportunity for a show. - Who cares? I got 17 reality shows run by fresh, young producers. - I still got some tricks and you have more than enough so I want to dance with the millionaire schlock. - They're cheap and the pigs will eat whatever you put in the trough. Move. - I want to take a crew up there and investigate the area. I've got some ideas. I can give you a hit show. I promise. - I want more than a hit show. I want proof. - Deal. - Rick. This is it. How was your trip? - The whole area is a swamp. I'm never going back there. What do you think? - Well the wound looks better. I'm just worried about infection. - Ah, he'll be fine. He's so much sweeter than that last one. Elijah? - Oh my! - Killer, right out of the crate. - Well let's just be certain. Overnight a seven day dose pack of doxycycline. - We can't. Haskins RX called again this morning. They won't deliver anything else until we're current. Just use my card. Ellen. - Please, just do it. Hi there. Hi. Dr. Ellen, there's a Mr. Paxton in your office. - Who? - Excuse, can I help you? - Dr. Freese? - Yeah, who are you? - What do you think this is? - A bear. - Right there, the toes. Where are the claws? - I have no idea. - Well it's pretty obvious it's not a bear. - What would you like me to say exactly? - What are the odds that this is an undiscovered species? - I don't have time for this. - Extra funding would go a long way around here don't you think? - Who are you? - My name is Rick Paxton. I'm putting together a team to investigate what could be out there. I need a primate specialist, I'd like you to join us. $10,000. For one week of your time. I'll be in touch. - What was that all about? - He wants me to help him find Bigfoot. He said $10,000 for a week. - When do you leave? - It's Bigfoot. - So what? Spend a week running around the woods. That's a lot of money. Ellen, You could really use a break from all of this. Sorry. We've got the grandkids for the weekend. Hi Grandma. - Hi sweetie. You're watching what? Oh. - Did you get the quote? How much? Jesus. No, I have to have a helicopter. Because you can't drive up there. Yeah, fine. But I'm not gonna pay him his full rate just to sit around and wait for us. I don't care, I... I don't care, just get it done. Hi. Where can I find this girl's father? Cooper Barnes? - Who's asking? - Rick Paxton. - Another reporter? I thought I was done with all y'all. - No. I'm not a reporter-- Easy Betsy. - I've got a job for you. I'm a TV producer, putting a team together to investigate what happened up there. I don't believe it was a bear. - I'm busy. - Yeah, I heard. Heard you been searching these hills. I need someone who knows these mountains. Look, I'm sorry about what happened to your daughter. Alex Barnes, right? The missing girl. As long as you're looking for a body you might as well get paid. Whoa, easy. Easy cowboy. I didn't mean it like that. I'm just trying to help. 2,500 bucks for one week. We could use you and we could help you find your daughter. Dr. Freese, so glad you could join us. All right quickly, introductions. This is Dr. Ellen Freese, she's our primate specialist. That's Peter Moore, renowned cryptozoologist. And this is Justin, he's our camera man. - Hello. I can take that from ya. - Over by the helicopter is Mr. Singer, he's on loan as security. - Um. - Just to make sure we're all safe. My assistant Danny Kent and our guide Peter Barnes are already at the location and our final member should be here shortly. Justin, everything ready to go? - Almost. Just got to check a couple more cases. - All right, well get it done. - So she's on the radio, she says, "There's a fog bank rolling in." - Desert Storm. Six months in that sand pit. You? - Yeah, I've seen some action. - 'Nam? Yeah, I know Ike, it's okay. - He looks up, know what he says? "There ain't no fog bank out there." He looks again, he says, "Hey, there's a fog bank out there." It's a classic scene. - So what are you doing here with these civvies. Baby sitting. And that's the baby. - Oh hell no! - Everybody this is Cooper Barnes our guide, that's my assistant Danny. - Oh! - Yeah, everything's good to go. - Bridgette Powers, journalist. - We've met. Enjoy the flight? - And the flight service. - Stay with the helicopter. If I need anything, I'll call the sat phone. - We'll be here. Ah, it looks like it's you and me Ike. Go catch us some dinner. Yeah, this is a good spot. Justin, you point that way. Okay. Mr. Moore, right there. Bridgette. - Mr. Moore, how long have you been doing this? - Since 1974. I was a farmer in Northern California. One night, I was in the barn feeding the horses and I smelled something horrible. It was like skunk mixed with wet dog. The horses went crazy, and then I saw... it. It was dark out but I could tell it was huge, at least seven feet. It looked at me and grunted. Then it went off into the trees. And I've been studying sasquatch ever since. - Anything else? - No, no, no. That's enough. Let's keep moving. Oh ma'am. - Shouldn't you be leading. - Just follow them. Didn't they teach you anything in the army? - Marines. - Oorah. Is that our campsite? No, about an hour away. People live out here, so the roads-- No, they'd be logging roads. Those cabins are just for huntin' and fishin'. Goddammit! You said that I could post updates, I have followers. - Yeah, we're almost there. Oh she's doing fine. Yes Roger, your son is a lucky man. - Water. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah, yeah you'll get it, I promise. - It happened here. It happened here! The massacre it happened-- - Hey! Watch your mouth. - Sorry. - Ah, there you are. Took longer than I thought. - I'm sorry, but the brochure didn't say anything about a 10 mile nature hike. - Did you test everything? - Yup. Soon as Mr. Moore selects the hotspots for the rest of the trail cameras we'll get those set up. - We're losing the light, let's get on this. All right. I'll tag along. Cool. - We use a natural fiber rope. Animals tend to avoid man-made objects. - Yeah, that explains the bird house. - Many think that's why it's so difficult to get a picture of a Sasquatch. Tracking device. When something takes the bait, we'll be able to monitor it back at the base camp. - Where do you want the pheromones? Phero what? - It's a scent that animals use for attracting mates. - Ah, sasquatch Spanish fly. Yeah, pour it on the meat. Just a drop or two. Splendid. Let's go. - We good to go? - Uh yes. We've covered some areas of heavy travel. One is down by the stream and the other one is facing a game trail. - Rick what's the plan tonight? Am I working or not? - We're staying at the base camp tonight. Peter's gonna do some call blasting, see if he can draw something close in. - Call blasting? - Yes, I want to take these strategically placed speakers and play some various animal sounds. If there is something out there, we should get a response. - And in the morning, we'll look for evidence of activity. - Ah yes, the evidence. - Evidence? What evidence, Cheech? - The evidence of this undiscovered primate can come in many forms. Of course there's footprints. Those are fragile, watch where you walk. Often there is a strong skunk-like odor and sometimes tree-breaking has been reported. They bend trees and branches to mark their territory. - Bent branches in the forest. How are we possibly gonna find some of those? - And, if you see a pair of red eyes in the darkness staring at you, it may be too late. - It's one a.m. on night one. Peter Moore is attempting communication by call blasting various animal vocalizations. As of now, we've had no response. Okay cut. How do I look? - Fabulous. - Yeah, obviously. - That sounds like a mountain gorilla. What is it? - This particular one was recorded during a Bigfoot expedition in 1997. It was analyzed at the University of Minnesota and it didn't match any known species in the database. - Well it's definitely a primate of some kind I'm su... - Oh, cut it Justin. Well, that was exciting. - This isn't quite as glamorous as I was expecting. - No. - I think I'm gonna turn in. Are you okay? I think we have enough of this. More than enough. Get some sleep. Nice work. I think we're gonna need to try something else. - There you are you little thing. You're not supposed to be chewing on my nuts. - Breakfast is almost ready. - Thanks. - Whoo! - All right, wake up everybody else. - I'll get 'em. Sleeping beauty. Hey, sleeping beauty. Oh! Mm, copy that. All right. Where's Peter? - Who? - Peter Moore. - Our cryptozoologist. - Your bunk mate. - Never saw him. I don't even think he slept in the tent. - Where you planning to say something about that? - I just figured the hippie was off smoking dope. - All right. Has anybody seen Peter Moore this morning? - The last time I saw him was last night. He was gonna check on the trail cameras. - Sounds like a good place to start. - On it. Some misfires. Some animals. And then there's this. - Dr. Freese. Could you come in here and take a look at this please. - Any sign of Peter? - Just this. - What do you think? - About that? I don't know. A big dark, hairy... - Barnes? - Looks like a bear. Or an old man in a gorilla suit. - Come here. Are you ready? Okay. It's around 9.30 a.m. on day two. Peter Moore, our cryptozoologist has gone missing. - Peter is missing. Who cares about that blur, we need to find him. - Wait. What blur? - For all we know he's fine and sleeping off a long night. - What blur? - Cheech. He got himself lost. - Maybe. All the more reason to go looking for him. - What goddamn blur? - Look we aren't scheduled for anything until dark, right? - We have to review the footage. But you're fine till later. - Great. - I don't know why everyone's getting so excited about some hairy blob. This is very exciting! We just found our first piece of hard evidence. A trail camera has captured an image of a Bigfoot in the wild. Whether or not this has anything to do with our missing team member is only speculation. All we can do now is hope and pray, that we find him still alive. Okay, I'm done. - Is anyone coming? - Pass. - Great. Peter! Peter! Peter! Hey! Barnes... - The rain didn't help this morning. But I can definitely see a struggle here. - Justin for base camp. - Tracks go here. That's his blood. - Peter! - Shh. It's fresh. - What is it? - It's dragging him. It's not letting go. - Y'all are serious? We're gonna? Okay. Barnes... - This is fucked up. No! This is fucked up! What? What is that? Intestines. Justin for base camp. Go for base camp. - Uh. We found something. Is it Moore? - I hope not. We're in a mine and there are intestines hanging from the ceiling. Did you film it? On it. Those are fresh. - Yeah. Looks like sausage right? - Oh! Barnes. - Thanks for the jokes. Great. Justin, I have the perfect summer job for you... You're a camera guy, it's gonna be great. - How? - We should go. - No, no, nothing yet. Roger let me call you in the morning. Yes, we'll have something solid. Okay two teams. Dr. Freese, Danny, you're with Barnes. Head back to where you were earlier today. Singer, you've got Bridgette and Justin, go south. I'm gonna stay here and monitor and I want regular updates. Regular updates. - Bear spray. - That shit don't work. - My bad. I forgot about your invisible force field. Let's go. - It's just before 10 p.m. on night two. With no luck at our base camp last night. We're now actively searching the dense forest. Our guide is using a FLIR camera. Fucking forest. Which stands for Forward-Looking Infra-Red. It senses heat and anything living will come up bright red on the screen. Danny For base camp. - Go for base camp. We found something. - What is it? A whole bunch of logs and branches. - Danny, why are you calling me about a bunch of sticks? - Well because it looks like it was done to block the path. - All right, get some B-roll, get plenty of footage and we'll cut it with what Peter was talking about earlier. Copy that. - What do you think? Justin, anything to report? - Nope. We are wrapping up a technical difficulty. - Tell her to put it out and get her skinny ass in gear. - You heard the man. - What was that? - See that? - What is it? - Got something on the FLIR. Following it now. - Out there, past those trees. I see you. Ugh, this is bullshit man. I should be in a glossy studio right now. Jesus Christ, where are we going? Shh. - Both of you, wait here. And goddamn it, be quiet. Fuckin' civvies. Nice work. You scared off your story. - Too bad the real tracker wasn't with us. Did you learn anything in the army? - Thank you. Justin for base camp. Go for base camp. - Well, we saw a couple of things on the FLIR but we lost whatever it was. Okay. Everyone come on back. - Copy that. Where are we? - You guys took your good sweet time. - We got lost. - What happened? - Well we saw something. So we followed it for a bit. Singer had it for a moment, but we lost it. - What did it look like? Guys come take a look at this. Give me a second. That's the first one. Now hang on. This is the best one. - It's walking upright. - You are gonna need a bigger banana. - Barnes, something is going on. - Yeah, something is going on. Haven't you noticed Peter is missing and nobody cares. What the hell? - All right people, saddLe up. It's time to earn your pay checks. - Miss Powers. I know you're tired, your feet hurt. But if you could find the time, put your fucking boots on! I put this on Powers' coat. - You sure that's a good idea? - Fuck it. - I think it's up there. - Oh Jesus. Hey, where's Bridgette? - Ugh. Oh, dammit! Perfect. Hello? Justin? Danny? Oh! Oh my god. - No it's okay, it's okay just go. Just go! What was that? - Do you see anything? - I don't see anything. - Dammit! This way. Bridgette! Bridgette! Bridgette! Bridgette! No, no, no. She's all right. - Whoa, it's all right. - It's all right. - Whoa! - We gotcha. It's all right. Breathe, just breathe. Don't look. - It's a compound fracture. - No shit. - Just try to relax. Can you feel your foot. - We have to get out of here. We have to get out of here right now. - Barnes, get me two sticks-- - No, there's no time, there's no time! We have to leave right now. Thank you. - Calm down. - What are you doing? What are you doing? Wha, no, no! - It's gonna be just-- Fine. Okay, thank you. - Danny to base camp. Base camp, come in. Base camp, where are you? Dammit. Danny? - I think we just. Let's figure out how to get her back to base camp. - Okay. All right, I got her. Let's go. See if you can find me a full medical kit. There's one in the other tent. Okay. - What the hell you doing in my tent? - Med kit. - Med? - Oh thanks. - Oh shit. - Welcome back. - Why didn't you or the jarhead radio me? - We did. Why weren't you on the radio? - I was checking the cables, one of the cameras went out. - And you didn't hear the radio? - I must have left it in the tent. What happened to her? - She fell. Something scared the hell out of her. Then we heard some strange growling while you were doing whatever it is you were doing. - I told you I was... Wait, what, what growling? - Oh don't worry, she'll be fine. - What growling? - Hey Danny? - Hmm. - You guys come up with a name for your documentary yet? - Mr. Paxton hasn't said. - Well I've been thinking of some ideas. - Of course you have. - "The Blair Foot Project" "Yeti Does Dallas" - Aw. - That's a good one. - We're not leaving. Especially now, with all this activity. You say they're chasing something in the woods. We're not leaving. - We don't need to leave but we need to get Bridgette to a hospital. Danny can drive her to the helicopter. With a compound fracture. Just call Jonesy. - You know, the helicopter doesn't have a winch. Why do you think we hiked in here? - Well then I think we need to call search and rescue. - Luckily Ellen, you're not here to make decisions. - Oh and where did you get your medical degree? - We have a production to finish. And I am not gonna call search and rescue and have them scare away whatever hope it is we have of shooting tonight. Singer. Base camp for Danny. Go for Danny. - Camera three is down. Get it fixed. - Copy that. Okay guys, you're on your own. Meet you back at base camp. - Singer. Do your job. - I work for Brannan. - Danny... "The Hills Have Fur" That's the best one. This guy. - I don't think that getting a blow job from Princess Powers is why Brannan hired you. Know your place. We're done. - You got that right. - After you. - Yeah. How is she? - She's stable. We're lucky the bone didn't nick an artery or a vein, so. - Listen Doc. Be careful. Don't turn your back on that guy. You don't know these people. You want to know the real- - We have to leave! We have to leave now. - Bridgette, you're okay. - I saw it. It's fucking real and it tried to kill me. Singer. - Let go of me. - Breathe, breathe! - Goddamn it let go of me! - Wait, wait! Let her talk. - No! - What did she see out there? - Wha? Ike? Oh, Ike! You fuck. You fucked with the wrong aviator. - Come here. - Barnes. - Yeah. - I got to tell you, I'm not really a fan of this. Hear that? - We're in the woods, I hear every... - Hear that? It's coming from over there. - Where'd it go? Did you see that? Where the fuck is it? - It's up there. Shh. Don't move. Don't move. What the fuck is that? - Listen, listen, listen! What the? MOVE! - Ah! You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. - Maybe we can still catch it. - No, I think I've had enough. - We still have the IR camera. Aren't you curious as to what just threw a giant boulder at us? - I got a pretty good idea what it was. - Base camp to Danny. Thought you said you fixed that trail camera. It's broken again. - You're an asshole. That little stunt of yours could have got us all killed. Son of a bitch. - What the hell you talking about? - No. - Stop it. Stop your lies. Six kids died up here and my daughter was one of those kids. And all you care about is a goddamn TV show about Bigfoot. - Well it's better than obsessing about finding some dead body. - What you say! - No! - What did you say? - Stop it! All of you. Jesus. - Holy shit. - Bridgette is hurt and Peter is still missing. We don't have time for this. Base camp, come in. - Go. Got to see this. Camera's destroyed and there's a footprint, a big one. - Copy that, I'm on my way. Everybody keep it together and do your fuckin' jobs. Let's go. - It's that way. - We'll finish this later cowboy. - Rick. You're an asshole. Dr. Freese if you don't mind. - Fine. - You know this isn't a hoax. We didn't stage any of this. Maybe you'll figure that out after I come back with a size 17 footprint. Hey Chief. - Thank you. - Yeah. Listen. We both know these guys are grade A, number one, alpha assholes. - Yup. - We need a plan. - Yes we do. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh! Oh wow! - Look at this. - Come to daddy. And then there's this. - Well Dr. Freese? - Danny do you have a tape measure in there? Yeah. - It's 18 and a quarter, heel to big toe. Over seven side to side. The detail is remarkable. You can see scar tissue, skin. More hair. This would be tough to fake. - Justin, roll footage on this just in case the mold doesn't work. Danny, get a sample of that hair. - Uh guys, this is awesome. - You're gonna have to do more testing on the hair but it certainly looks like the footprint of a very large, very real primate. - Oh. H-h-hello? - That thing is out there. It just ran by. What? What? - Jesus. - Okay. - What's going on? - It's blood, it's blood, it's fucking blood. Get this shit off of me. Okay, okay. - Get it off of me. - You're okay, you're okay. Get it off of me. - Okay boys, give her some space. Okay, okay. Get it off me. - You're okay, you're okay. Right now all I care about is getting her safe after that we can argue about whatever it is you want to do. - You know trashing the production tent isn't gonna get you home any sooner, right? - Rick just make the call. - I can't. The sat phone is missing. - Why the fuck would I take the phone Paxton? - I don't know. We're at the footprints and you're back here, weeping. - We still need to get her out of here. - Danny, take the ATV, go back to the helicopter. Use the sat phone to contact search and rescue. You happy? - Thank you. - Everybody, take a nap. Get yourselves together. We start shooting again in a little while. - Hey Jonesy. Jonesy! We need the sat phone, Bridgette's been hurt. Jesus. Did you have a late night? Jonesy? - Morning Doc. - Hi. Morning Dr. Freese. - Where is everyone? - Paxton is still reviewing footage and Bridgette is... out. - No sign of Danny? - Not yet. - What about Barnes? - He's been gone for a while. Sleep much? - Not much. I always hated the sight of blood. Med school was fun. What's that? - I've been thinking about my grandfather. He was a forest ranger up here for 30 years. He was high up in the mountains one night, by himself. A storm came through, so he went into a cave to wait it out. At the back of the cave he found... - A huge pile of bones. - Not just any bones. Bears, bobcats, predators. Killed and all piled up. He said he heard a noise deeper in the cave so he took his flashlight and he started looking through the shadows. And that's where he saw red eyes, glowing red eyes. He said he let out a scream. He started running and that thing chased him all the way to town. Said he never really felt the same up here again. - And the tag? - Well, my grandfather said when dangerous predators went into town, the rangers would tag them and release them. If they came back, they'd take them deeper into the forest, always to the same place. That cave yesterday, I found a whole bunch of these. - Something's killing the rogue animals. Hey, um, did I hear you say you had a daughter? - Yeah. - What's her name? - Her name's Alex. - Where the hell is he? - It takes a while to get here. - Nine hours! This is bullshit. Hey, um, monkey lady. The drugs are wearing off, I need more. - I'm sorry, you can't take anything for another hour. - Perfect. One hell of a production you got here. Unsafe working conditions. Psychotic arts and crafts, shitty food. What's next. - All right ready. - It's 4.30 p.m. on day three. Despite several attacks and severe injuries, this journalist is going strong. Nothing is going to, holy fuck! Where are you hurt? - Jonesy's dead. Very, very dead. - What happened? - I saw it. - He has a concussion. We gotta get him inside the mess tent. Come on Danny. - Where's the ATV? - Someone get me a flashlight. In my backpack. - There's no one to fly the chopper. How the hell are we gonna get out of here? - Danny look at the light. Look at the light Danny. - Danny where's the sat phone? Dammit Danny, where's the sat phone? - Didn't you hear me? Jonesy's fuckin' shredded. - Hey! Hey! Who stole my meds. - Singer what? What are you doing? - Taking charge of your shit show chief. - You can't do that, it's my show. - You gonna stop me. Good luck with that. First thing we're gonna do is beef up security. We're getting out of here tomorrow. We just gotta survive tonight. Here you go. - Yeah. - You got this? - Yeah. - Full mag, one in the chamber. Safety's on. No shit. - Afghanistan. Helmand Province. Thought I'd fired my last shots there. Guess not. How's Danny? - He's a little banged up, but he'll be all right. So what's next? - We wait. - Yup. Maybe... - Tracking device. Bait's on the move. - It's hauling ass. Jesus. Let's go. - Think it's stopped. 50 meters away. Barnes, you got anything? No. Do you? Negative. - What is that smell? - I think it's what we're looking for. - It's right over there. Over there? - Yeah, it's over there. It's right over there. You okay? - I'm fine. - Uh Singer. - It's a raccoon. - I think there's still something out there! - What? - There's still something out there. There's something moving, I don't know what it is. - Yeah, a goddamn raccoon. - Singer! - Look behind you. - Singer! No! - We gotta go! - Where are you? Okay. Danny over here. Oh my god, Danny! No! No! - What the fuck. - Hey! Hey! Where's Singer? - He's dead. - What the fuck are you talking about? - That thing ripped his throat out. - Danny's dead too. - What now? - We can go back to the helicopter and see if that sat phone is still working. - Any place is better than here. - When Brannan hears about this shit, you're done. He told me about you. Your career has been a complete cluster fuck. Fuck up after fuck up. Maybe, Brannan will let you fetch me my coffee on my next show. Two fucking creams, two fucking sugars. - Rick help me with her. - Get me my fucking refill. No! - Bridgette! Bridgette! Bridgette! Let me see. Let me see. Okay, he missed your liver. We have to get him out of here before he bleeds out. Okay. If we can just make it down to the river. Just leave me. - Come on. - You go, go, go. It's okay. Barnes we're almost there. I see a cabin. There's a bunch of cars. No. Try to use the stick to pry the foot. Ah God. - I'm sorry. It isn't working. I'm gonna go get help. Hello. Barnes. - Hello? Hello? Oh my God. Can you please help us it's an emergency. My friends, someone is attacking us. - You'll be fine, stranger. You'll be fine. Oh. You people with all your toys. We go to town. We watch you all. You talk, you talk, and not say anything. Don't see anything around you. Too busy, fiddling with your petit boxes. What good they do you now. He needs help. - Relax, fille. - What is wrong with you? - We, we? What was you gonna do with it? Tie it up, poke it.
