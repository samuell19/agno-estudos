Dude, so I've been having those like super fucking vivid dreams again, man, where they just feel like so real and they just, they like creep me out, bro. And this one, man, I'm out on this beach, right, and I can see there's like something in the distance, like freaking out, I'm like, what the fuck is that? So I go up to it, right, and it's like this baby whale. And it's like freaking out, and I'm like, what the fuck is this thing doing? 'Cause we're not like super close to the water, it's just the sand, I'm like, where the fuck is the water? How'd this thing get all the way out here, right? So this thing like won't stop freaking out. So I had to like grab like a piece of wood or something from the ground and just like smash this thing to get it to like chill out, like knock it out, right, and so I pick it up, it's like all slippery and shit. But I throw it up on my shoulder and I start like fucking marching this thing through this mall, right? And I come up and I see this luggage carousel and it's got like this big green light and it's like loaded with fish. I'm like, this is, there's something going on here. Let me figure out what the fuck this is, right, and this carousel was leading out to the ocean. I'm like, I know what I gotta do now, right? I'm just gonna drop this fucking thing on the carousel and be done. So I go over there to put the thing down, it's still heavy, it's like a whale. It's a small whale, but it's still a fucking whale, it's heavy, you know? And I drop it on this carousel and it fucking breaks the thing, and like it, and then this light on top, it like starts flashing red. I'm like, oh shit, I just fucked something up. I'm like, I don't know if I should run or try to fix it. I'm like, fuck this, and but as soon as the thing fell, it fell into the water, right? But as soon as it fell into the water, this big metal piece comes down and fucking impales the whale. Like I did all this shit trying to save this whale, and I just fucking killed it, man. It's like bleeding out all over the place. It was fucked, and yeah, it was, it was weird, man.

He was saying King Kong is a racist movie. Like, you know, the building and the girl, and you just think about the whole geography of it- - What? - And, yeah. I mean, I kind of agree. Come. This place is getting fucking depressing. It's the second time that kid has pulled some shit. It wasn't always like this before, man, I know. I know. Oh, shit. Where the... Look man, I can only pay you 50 this time, on account of all the shit that was broke and everything. On account of all the shit that was - broke and everything. - Yeah, cool. All right, good job tonight, brother, considering. You be safe out there. Have a good one. God, this place is getting fucking depressing. I told you before but I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. But I can fix this, I can make things better for you, I can. How do you think you make me feel, Jon? How do you think I feel with you sitting at my dinner table eating this food? I don't know, but I can fix things. - I love your food. - You don't understand. I'm hungry, I want to eat, that is why I'm here. I need to feed myself. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're not sorry, if you were sorry, you would look under there and you would feed the food to that. I don't understand. Look under there, Jon. Look under the table, Jon. Oh, god, what's that smell? Look under the table, Jon! Mora? Mora? Yes? Hey. Hey. Can I come in? Yeah, sorry, I forgot you were coming. Mora! Jon. I can't stop listening to it. Me too. It's driving me crazy. Me too. What the hell? It never bothers me. Why is it bothering me? I mean, it's kinda late, do you think I should knock? Maybe. You think I should? Well, I mean, I don't know, maybe, it is kind of late. I mean, it makes sense to just politely ask him to not play so loud so late. But I don't really want to be that guy. Why, why am I the dick? No, okay, you are not the dick, he's the dick. Why the hell is this bothering, this never bothers me. Why'd you do this to me? What, I didn't do anything to you, what are you talking about? Do you want me to go? What? Do you want me to go? Like I'll go ask him to stop. - No, no. - Why? It's driving you crazy, I can tell. No, I'm too embarrassed for you. You're embarrassed for me? Yes, Beth, I'm asking you not to. That doesn't make any sense, why would you - be embarrassed for me? - It makes perfect sense. I'm the one doing it. Beth, why do you insist on doing what I ask you not to do? Because I'm trying to help you and you don't let me make my own decisions, which is something - that I'm capable of doing. - That's not what I'm saying. Like, I can actually make decisions. All right, you can do whatever you want, I'm just saying- - Okay, I can't do whatever I want because you yell at me. That's cause you're fucking asinine. Excuse me? You're being asinine. Do you even know what that means? Of course I know what that means. What does it mean? I'm pretty sure I know what it means. What the hell was that? I think we're being too loud. We are not that loud. Beth, we were screaming. What about the trumpet player? He's a good kid. He's loud. Nevertheless. So you're not gonna go get the door, you're just gonna leave him there? No, I know what they want. They know I know what they want, just be quiet now. Just don't understand you sometimes. What do you want me to do, do you want me to go? Where the fuck is my shirt, Jon? I don't know where your shirt is, Beth. Okay, well, you took it off. Yeah, I remember that. Jesus, what the fuck is under here? Okay, like what did you do, did you just - toss it up in the air? - Did you look under the bed? Yes, I just looked under the bed, are you not - even paying attention? - Was it under there? No, it wasn't under the bed. Would I be talking to you if it was under the bed? No you can't, that's my favorite jacket, - you can't take that. - Okay, I don't care. I'm taking it, and it doesn't- No, that's, hey, that's backwards. Okay, whatever I don't care, maybe I wanna - wear it backwards. - You're gonna stretch it out. You can't stretch it out, that was my grandfather's jacket. I don't care! I think we should stop seeing each other because this isn't working. What? Are you breaking up with me? We are not a couple. What about the thing tomorrow? The thing, what? The mermaid thing, you invited me. The mermaid? I'm not going to a mermaid thing tomorrow. Well, I'm going to the mermaid thing tomorrow. Okay, you go to the mermaid thing - tomorrow. - I am! Okay, good, have fun! I will. Okay, good, why the fuck do you keep telling me about it? So what now then? We have a show on Saturday, shithead. Fuck, I forgot about that. Hi there. How much, how much for the mermaid show? Nine bucks. Nine, nine bucks. You got change for 20? What happened to your eye? You know you can't go in there, right? What do you mean? Show doesn't start till eight tonight. You bought a ticket for the show. But I thought there was stuff going on all night in there. Yeah, that's the regular exhibit. That regular exhibit goes on all night. Okay. You wanna buy a ticket to the regular exhibit? I guess, if I, if I buy the ticket for the regular exhibit, can I go in now? Yeah, obviously, you buy the ticket, you can go in. All right, well, I was just making sure because I thought that's what the first ticket did. First ticket was the show ticket. The normal thing goes on all night. All right, all right, I'll just get the normal ticket, - then, I didn't know. - All right, no need to get aggressive. - I'm just trying to explain. - Okay, all right, okay, okay. Can I just do an exchange for the show ticket for the normal ticket? You can, I can't do exchanges. You gotta go over to the customer service. - If you want to do an exchange. - I'm not going to the, no, I'll just buy the normal ticket, how much is it, how much is it? Five bucks. Five, change for a 10? Boy, you are really cleaning me out all my change over here. Hey, this is mine. Silvio Samuel. Silvio, they love you! Hey. - Hey. - What are you watching? Nothing, how are you? I'm glad you called. Okay, so I couldn't figure anything out about this Anna girl, but I know there's something weird going on at that carnival. It's owned by this dude, Salvador Montalvano. Salvador, you mean Salvatore, right? Salvador. Salvatore, it's Italian. Great, so it's owned by this Italian dude who I saw at the mermaid show and he was all like, I don't know, I don't know. Okay, so what about this girl? Well, I, I think she's not safe. Jon. No, I'm serious, and I, this dude Salvador- - Salvatore. I know he has something to do with it. Why would Salvatore have anything to do with it? Because he's scary, angry and evil. I don't think you should be drinking coffee right now. It doesn't affect me. Okay, so who's Anna? I don't know. But didn't you talk to her? Yeah, but she was, she's very aloof. Aloof? And she looks like Mona? Like exactly like Mona, like she have a twin sister? Shouldn't you know that? You knew her longer. No, she didn't have a twin sister, but... So what now, then? ♪ If you found a heart that beats with a feeling ♪ ♪ Then you found a heart that's also ♪ ♪ Willing to give you love ♪ Okay, I have to tell you something. It's this weird thing I know but I feel like we have some sort of connection or something and you look exactly like my dead ex-girlfriend. That's how you're gonna say it? Well, what am I supposed to say? You should say that... "You, you look like someone I used to know." No, you should say, "You remind me" "of someone I used to know," that sounds better. Okay, I have to tell you something. I feel like we have some sort of connection or something and you remind me of someone I used to know. Your dead ex-girlfriend? Oh, come on, I can't do this. Maybe I should just shouldn't say anything. You gotta be ready for that. It sounds like that's what you're gonna say. You can see it in your face, like your face totally says that. Dude, she... Well, okay, so what am I supposed to do then? Okay. If I can't say that, yeah, she just won't care. I shouldn't say anything. About what, what are you talking about? About Mona. Okay. About Mona, the mermaid looks exactly like Mona. Okay. Okay, I have an idea, I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna come down here, and I'm gonna help you and we're gonna do it, okay. So I want you to look me in the face and I want you to, I want you to say what you would say to her to me. Okay. I know we just met, but I feel like we have this connection and you look exactly like my ex-girlfriend who died not that long ago. No, man, you're so out of control. I'm, whoa, whoa, what is your damage? What the hell? What do you mean, "What the hell?" Why would you do that? All right, I'll see you later, I guess. Jon, I think you should spy on her. Spy on her? That's what you're gonna leave me with. Yeah, you know where she works, go back tomorrow, wait until she leaves- No, no, no, - I'm not doing that. - And see what you can see. See what I can see? Beth, I'm not doing that. Don't be an ash mat. Excuse me? Yeah, don't you want to know who she is, man up. I do want to know who she is but I'm not, I'm not spying on her. I'm better than that. Whatever. Ash mat? Shit, shit, shit, get your head in the game, come on. Excuse me. Yeah, um, nice mask. I was just admiring your groovy ride here, beach cruiser. So what, is it dangerous riding this thing out here? Lots of car accidents, have you ever been in a car accident? What do you want? I'm Bruce. Okay, this... Here's what it is. I think that we have some sort of connection or something and you look like someone I used to know. I'm wearing a mask. I'm wearing a mask. You're wearing a mask. Aren't we all wearing masks? Some are silk- Yeah, okay. Some are silk, some are satin, some are steel. Some are leather, some are feathers. They're the, hm? The faces of a stranger. But we love to try them on. Shit, shit. Goddammit. Yes? What the hell? You following me? What the hell? What? What are you doing? What is your problem? I know what you're doing. What? You know what I'm talking about, the mask, Anna, why the mask? Oh, yeah, I thought you knew what I was doing. I know enough. Oh God. What do you think I'm doing? Evil shit. I'm leaving. Follow me, and I will do evil shit to you. Your name is Mona. What? You're Mona. I know it's you, all right, when the fuck is this- - What? - Gonna stop? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about, and- - Shit. Who is that? Hey- Let go. When is this gonna stop, why are you doing this to me? Look, my name is Anna. And you don't want to be involved in this. No, your name is Mona. You're Mona- Let go. I'm Jon, who the fuck is that? - Let go, or I'll- - You know I saw that house in my dream, did you know that I saw that? I'm not responsible for your dreams. Neither am I. Hey, who- Let go. Who is that?

Ever since I haven't been like partying so much, and- - Did you find out anything about Anna? Nope, nothing. Nothing? Seems totally normal. We're all out camping at like this lake- - Well, you know what I was thinking maybe this time what you can do is you can go back- Beth, drop it. No, really, listen, this is a good idea, you can go back and look her directly into the eyes and- Beth, I'm serious. Please stop it, please. Okay, all right. I'll let it go. And it comes up to me and I remember this, this story of like when I was a little kid about this like pond- I never apologized about the other night. The other night? Yeah, I just had a lot, like on my mind altogether. I spaced out, I just completely spaced out. - There was so much going on. - I thought it was my fault. Don't worry about it. What? I mean, with everything going on with Mona and this mermaid girl like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. What does that have to do with anything? I mean, even though you were giving me mixed signals, it was kind of a dick move to make a move on you. I'm talking about the night we played and I skipped your solo. - I don't remember that. - I'm not talking about the night that I came over. And I'm not sorry about that either because you were being a dick. Beth, you don't always have to remind me of my failures. - Okay, well. - I remember them. I will remind you of your failures when they involve me. And, well actually, besides, you already said that you were being a dick - and you admitted to it. - Why are you this way? Why am I this way? I'm just the way that God made me. - Camping and drinking and- - Oh, great, yeah, well, have you ever thought maybe, maybe think about this, there's something that you could have done differently in a situation. What situation? I wasn't being a dick, really. Yes, you were, you were being a dick. - I wasn't being a dick. - And why would you say that? You already admitted and apologized - to being a dick. - I thought you were - apologizing for being a dick. - You thought I - was being a dick? - And I was trying to self-defrecate on your behalf. What, self-defecate? I was trying to be nice. You're not nice. Yes, I am. No, you're not. Yes, I am. No, you're not, don't self-defecate on my behalf. I'm trying to be nice, Beth. You're not nice, Lee? - Lee, Lee is Jon nice? - Leave Lee out of this. - Jon's a nice, dude. - No, right? - Thank you, Lee. - No, what? - Why would you say that? - Lee knows. No, okay, you are not a nice guy. - Ask- - Don't bring Danny into this. - Ask Danny. - Don't even bring Danny - into this. - Danny, am I a nice guy? Danny don't answer that, - you don't have to answer that. - You let your 14-year-old - brother jump in? - See, you're not a nice guy. Do I take a lower pay than everyone because I'm a fucking asshole? Whoa, lift the glass! What the fuck are you doing? - It all spilled out- - Calm down. - Seriously, man, god. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, - it was an accident. - Why would you do that? Can somebody bring some paper towels? Were you listening to my fucking story? - I'm sorry, man. - Bruce, nobody cares about your dream, no one cares - about your dream. - Don't be such a bitch, Beth. Don't call me a bitch. Kind of a bitch, Beth. No matter what you do and where you go, I will always be there to watch you fuck it up. - Paper towels! - Damn, geez. Jesus Christ lady. Oh my god! Jon, what the fuck? How do you even? I don't even get that. I don't, I don't know. I mean, what the, I don't even understand Goddamn. I quit. What are you saying to me? I quit, I'm not coming back. This shit is crazy, man, look, look at this dude's, what do you call those? His dorsie, dorsa? Your lats? Lat, look, your lat, dude, look at this dude's lat. He's got lats the size of West Texas, motha fuck- - I'm not coming back, can I grab my check? Man, you gotta get over that girl. That's what you gotta do. Look, man, you do whatever you gotta do, but, there's the full 200. That should keep you going in the interim. The interim? Yeah, man, 'cause I care about you, physically- We said 250. Phys... We said 250? Physiologically. I can't do 250. But that should keep you going in the interim. All right, all right, I'll see you tomorrow. Look, this is some mutant shit. I can see the veins in your ass. You shoot up in your ass. Here you go, $5. All right, thank you. Hi, there- - $5 please. I actually just wanted to talk to the manager to get some information on the mermaid show. He's inside the exhibit, that's his office. Can I go talk to him now? I don't know, you can try. Okay, thank you. Wait! It's $5. But I'm not going to the show, I just, I told you, I just want to talk to the manager. The manager is in his office. His office is in the exhibit, it's $5. I was, can he come out here then? Because I was here yesterday, I already paid. I don't want to go see the show, I just want - to talk to the guy. - Today's wristband color is orange, you can't get in with a green wristband. It's $5 for today's wristband color, which is orange. What's this one do? Today's wristband color is orange. You can't get in with a white wristband, it's $5 for today's wristband color- Okay, okay. Which is orange. Okay, how 'bout this, how 'bout you go get the manager- - Come on, man, it's just five bucks. I'm not going into the show. I just wanna talk to the manager, she's not letting- - It doesn't matter, man, it's just five bucks. Just mind your own business for a second, man. Hey, this is my business, man. Okay, can you help me out with this at all, man? What is this? What are your names? My name is tickets are $5. Okay, listen, you little ticket Nazi, I just- - It doesn't matter, man, it's just five bucks. Hey, you, shut your mouth! What? What? What?

But he was the aggressor. It's not the way I see it. That's some bullshit, man. I was trying to mind my business, you know, just trying to keep it cool. Look, we asked several people, they said he was ordering tickets, arguing with concessions which is a whole separate incident. He turned to you, some obscenities were exchanged. No particulars were exchanged. You assaulted him in the face. That's what we understand. Several people saw this. Several witnesses said- Just a minute. That you assaulted him in the face. Wait. You might be right. But, I gotta say something. He was the aggressor. - Listen here, you shit. - You you're fucking up my fair, you're fucking up my customers, and you're fucking up my day. , I deal with like you on a regular basis, I am done playing nice. I want you to apologize to me for what you have done. Okay, wait. I gotta tell you something. Your breath smells like shit. I smell like shit?
