- Honey, I'm home. - Roger that. Copy at the boathouse. Right on time. Faisil, get your butt in here. Harry's inside. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming. - Hey, were you born in a barn? - Whorehouse. All right. You got your fur-coated razor blade there and a bunch of guys with guns. I'm switching to sub-vocal now. Check, check. Check, check. It's talk radio. You're on the air. Check. All right, that guard nearest to you is moving away. He's at the service door. He's inside. All right. Have you seen Khaled yet? Yep, there he is. How come billionaires are always short? Excuse me. Colonel! How are you? - It's so good to see you again. - Yes, it's been a long time. - Terrific. - Who was that guy? Could you hold this for a second? Thanks. Okay, you should be crossing the main foyer, heading for the stairs. Okay, keep moving. Keep moving. I'm in the library, and I'm heading out to the second-floor balcony. Modem in place. Transmitting now. Affirmatory. I think it's a good hook-up. These are encrypted files, guys. It's gonna take me just a few minutes. I got your password. - Magnificent, isn't it? - Yes, quite. I thought I knew most of Khaled's friends, but I don't believe I've met you before. No, we haven't met because I certainly would remember. Renquist, Harry Renquist. Juno Skinner. Juno Skinner. Juno Skinner. Come on, come on. Juno Skinner, arts and antiquities dealer, specializing in ancient Persia. This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. Very good. Sixth century BC, to be exact. - Do you like the period? - I adore it. Harry, we got a problem. Guards are going apeshit down there. Acquired most of these pieces for Jamal. Do you tango? Tango. Harry. Harry, you do not have time to tango, buddy. You copy? All right, Harry, don't be stopping to smell the roses now. You hear me? - You gotta get out of there. - Yes! Files are unlocked! Fast Faisil strikes again. I'm in. I'm down, baby. I got my hand up her dress, and I am going for the gold... Just copy the goddamn files, okay? Wow. And I thought this was just gonna be another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires. Harry, seconds count, buddy. Ditch the bitch. Unfortunately, I have to leave. I have a plane to catch. Well, call me sometime. My offices are in Rome. I would like that. Son of a bitch is with her two minutes and she's ready to bear his children. All right, twinkle toes, what's your exit strategy? I'm gonna walk right out of the front gate. Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy. Sir, may I see your invitation, please? Sure. Here is my invitation. - Shit. Here we go. - Slight change in plans. Stay. We're en route to the lower rendezvous point. I repeat, back-up rendezvous point. - Watch it! Watch it! - It's called ice, and it gets a little slick. - Harry, do you copy? - I got it. Shit. Oh, my God. I got it. I got it. I got it. - There he is. - Shit. Hi, guys. Yeah, that worked good. Right out the old front gate. Can you lean back a second? Let's go. We can still make our flight. All right, that's it for Mr. Renquist. Okay, go. All right, we got Harry Tasker billfold, Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub. Hotel bill, Tasker. You got two postcards here from Geneva. Got some house keys right there, and I've got a souvenir Swiss snowing village. - What's that for? - It's for Dana, stupe. - You know, bring your kid home a gift. - Got it. - The dad thing, that's right. Yeah. - Got it. Nice touch. - All right, pick me up tomorrow at 8:00. - Will do. The debriefing is at 1000. - See you at 8:00. Bye. - Okay. Hey, Harry. Did you forget something? What a team. All right, sleep fast, buddy. Hi, honey. How was your flight? - It was fine. - Good. Brought you a little gift from Switzerland. Snowy village. Wow. Thanks, Dad. - I've never had one of these. - You're welcome. Hey, you're late for school. You better get going. - Don't forget to feed Gizmo. - Okay. It's pretty lame. - I'm late. - Yeah, me too. How'd it go at the convention? Did you make all the other salesmen jealous? It was fantastic. You wouldn't believe it. You should have been there. We were the big hit of the show. With that new model ordering system, the 680, I told you about, I can write up an order and immediately, as soon as the customer's name comes up, you see what his credit line is, what he has ordered in the past, what discount he has gotten, every little detail. Sounds great. It's fantastic. That's why I love the computer business. Listen, the plumber called. He says he has to dig under the slab or something, it's gonna cost $600. - That's okay. - Well, it's not okay. It's extortion. So, what did you tell him? I slept with him and he said he'd knock off $100. That's good thinking. Bye, honey. Hello! Dana! Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon. - Good morning. Go to school. - Yeah, I am. Thanks, dear. Check these out. Check them out. Where's the image coming from? Got a CCD camera and a transmitter in a pack of smokes out there. It's pretty cool, huh? What the hell? - Bye, Dad! - What's she... Dana. - She's ripping you off. Dana! - I knew it. Dana! - Dana! - Let's go. Can't stop. I'm late. Bye, Dad! God. Shit. Kids. Ten seconds of joy, 30 years of misery. I got married three times, but at least I was never dumb enough to have any. Yeah, she shouldn't be stealing. I taught her better than that. Yeah, well, you're not her parents anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes a day you spend with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, daddy-o. You know, it's not just because you're a bad parent. I mean, kids today are 10 years ahead of where we were at the same age. - Morning. - Morning, Mr. Tasker. - I bet you think she's still a virgin. - Don't be ridiculous. - She's only... What is she now? - She's 14 years... - She's only 14 years old. - She's 14. Her little hormones are going like a fire alarm. I say it's even money she lets that physicist on the bike boink her. - Not Dana. - Not Dana. Denial. It's not just a river in Egypt no more, is it, Harry? She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion. Why don't you open the door? Or drugs. $20 here, $50 there. I figured my wife's scumbag boyfriend was taking it. Hell, he takes everything else. There's never a beer in the goddamn fridge. - I thought you moved out. - Well, I had to move back in. My lawyer said it'd give me a better shot at getting the house during the property settlement and so forth, but don't change the subject, man. - You still owe me 200 bucks. - Good morning, Janice. Good morning. Gentlemen, please identify yourselves to the scanner. - Harry Tasker, 10024. - Albert Gibson, 34991. All right, Frances. I don't believe we need you any longer now. Thank you. Sweet Jesus, Harry. You surely screwed the pooch last night, didn't you? Would you please tell me how I can see this as anything but a total disaster? Well, total is a strong word. Yeah, there are different degrees of totality. It's a scale, really, with a perfect mission on one end and then a total pooch screw on the other end, but, you know, we're really more... Faisil, you're new on Harry's team, aren't you? Yes. So what makes you think the slack I cut him in any way translates to you? Let me show you what we got. Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty, so we raid his private financial files. $100 million in wire transfers from the Commerce Bank International. Which we all know is a front for certain countries to finance terrorist activities. And that's why we think something really big is going down. And we know that a week ago four MIRV warheads were smuggled out of the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. We think Khaled's group bought the nukes and is trying to bring them over the US soil. So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentlemen. Don't you have anything remotely substantial? Harry, do you have any hard data? Well, nothing that you would call rock hard. Actually, it's pretty limp, sir. Then perhaps you better get some before somebody parks an automobile in front of the White House with a nuclear weapon in the trunk. I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. I mean, he's a sales rep, for Christ's sake. Whenever I can't sleep, I just ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. I mean, he acts like he's curing cancer or something. So I guess this means you didn't get away for the weekend after all. - No, Harry had to go out of town. - I'm shocked. Yeah, well, you know Harry. - What's up? - Here, check this out. There's a $2 million disbursement from Khaled to Juno Skinner. That's right, the babe at the party. But that doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled. No. No. See, he keeps his antique buys on a completely separate ledger. And this is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop, even for a total biscuit like her. All right. I want a complete work-up on her. - Do we know where she is? - Right here in River City. - You're kidding. - Well, she lives in Rome, but she does stuff for the Smithsonian. She has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices here. So I guess it's time to send in a specialist. - Care to tango? - Yes, I would. Assholes. Okay, it's all set up. You got a fax machine, ghost phones, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under the name of Renquist. All right. Reality check. Let's go. Hi, my name is Harry Renquist. I own a corporate art consulting company in San Francisco, and I have an appointment with Miss Skinner. - Harry! - Hello. Hello. I thought I'd see you again. I just didn't know it would be so soon. - What's the point of waiting? - I agree. So you said your clients are looking for something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters. Yes. They would like to see something very dramatic. That's a nice piece. And I talked to a number of people, and they all said you're the one to see. Really? Checking on me. So what did these people say about me exactly? Well, they said that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words and other art dealers and archeologists don't really like you very much. Those wimps. It's because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. See, most of our pieces come from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia sits 20 feet under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria, not the most popular places lately. So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy. Well, Mr. Renquist? Do you see anything you like? Maybe. Give me a break, Fise. I don't think they bugged my tuna sandwich. She's importing stuff from all over the Mid East. She could be moving money, guns, anything. The second you left there, we started getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front. All right. Let's step up the surveillance and put on two more guys. Maurizio, I said Saturday, not Tuesday. Saturday. Miss Skinner, may I have a word with you, please? Stupid, undisciplined bitch. It's a good thing you're paying me a lot of money. Do you realize there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Your telephones are almost certainly tapped. And you were busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist... He checked out okay. We do not tolerate mistakes. What would you like me to do? Find out where this Renquist is. Hello, Tektel Systems. Mr. Tasker's office. Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen. Is he in? Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs. Tasker. Let me try him in there. Hold, please. Relay, 10024. It's a patch from Tektel. It's Helen. Hello, honey. How are you? What's going on? Hi. I'm sorry to bother you in the middle of a meeting. It's just that Dana and I want to make sure that you're gonna be home by 8:00, 'cause we're going to a lot of trouble for your big birthday. And we just wanted to make sure that you were gonna be home, so we... Absolutely. This time you can count on me. - Promise? - Trust me. - Great. - Got to go. Bye. Bye. That's disgusting, Dana. Calm down. Hey, we got a friend. Three cars back on the inside lane. They've been on us since we left the hotel. You mean the station wagon? - Want me to lose them? - No. We need this lead. Unit Seven? Seven here. We need you at the Georgetown Mall in three minutes. Copy that. We're rolling. Helen's gonna be pissed. Well, you see, this is the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules. Pull over here. This is good. - Okay, testing, one, two, three... - I got you. I got you. I got you. Okay, they're right with us. I make three of them in the car. - Dickhead. - Blow me. Hey, Harry, I got a couple of them getting out of the car and coming after you. What, do you think I'm blind? Well, you do look like Ray Charles. So what's the plan? Just trying to get a closer look at Beavis and Butt-Head. - Hey, there's a third one still in the car. - Okay, stay on him. Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib. Not much. Listen, Harry forgot something back at the office. And you know Harry. And... Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye. Bye. See you soon. See? Harry. Harry, I lost the third guy. Shit! Hold it! Shit! Here. Cool off. Move! Move! Sorry about this. Look out! Get out of the way! Hey! Freeze! Thank God. Move! - Get in the car. - Yep. Here we go. Federal officer in pursuit of suspect. Sorry. Hey. Hey, Harry, what's your 20? Harry? Westbound, in the park. Suspect is on a motorcycle, and he's coming out on Franklin. - Copy that! - Okay. I want you on 14th in case he turns south. And I want Seven on the north side to box him in. Okay. And make it quick, because my horse is getting tired. Your horse? There he is! That's him! Come on! - Go around to the back. - Copy that. Out of my way! Move! Move! Out of my way! Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Jesus! - Sorry. - Hey! - Open it! - Watch it! - Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. Out of the way! Move! Move! Move! Federal officer! Get down! Now! Get off or die! - Get down! Now! - Move! Turn around! Hold still! Come on! Hold still! Hold still! Will you press the button for the top floor, please? Thank you. Help! Shut up! Say something. That's a fine animal. Stay against the glass! Come on. I'm so sorry. Stay there! Don't move! Come on, come on, come on! Okay, back up. Back up. Come on. You can do it. Come on. Good horse. Good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now. Come on. Yeah, that's teamwork now. Keep pulling. Come on. A little bit more. Attaboy. Okay. Now, what the hell were you thinking? I mean, I had the guy, and you let him get away. Look at me when I talk to you. What kind of a cop are you anyway? Hi, honey. I know you're upset. I'm sorry. I hurried home as fast as I could. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. And thank you for the party. Yeah, it was great. Hey. That's him. Okay. Pause it right there. Salim Abu Aziz. This guy is really hardcore. Highly fanatical. The man's a real psycho. He's been linked to dozens and dozens of car bombings. Hey, you know that café bomb in Rome last year? That was his. As well as the 727 out of Lisbon. This guy's a major player. Now he's formed his own splinter faction called Crimson Jihad. Yeah, I guess he thought the other terrorist groups were a little too warm and fuzzy for his taste. - They call him the Sand Spider. - Why? Probably because it sounds scary. This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would be even more impressive if you actually knew where he was. We'll get him. - Why don't you just pull over right here? - What's up? Well, I really screwed up with Helen last night. I'm just gonna run in and see if she's available for lunch to smooth things over a little bit. - So, Harry, do you just want me to hang? - Yeah, just hang. Okay, buddy, I'll just be hanging. Hold, please. - Helen, it's your mystery man on two. - Simon? Oh, my God. Hello? Simon? Simon? Yes, I can talk. You mean right now? Yes, I can meet you. Okay, I can't wait. Bye. Can you cover me for an hour? Just an hour? You should tell that stud to take more time. Would you shut up? I should have never told you about him. Have a good time. - Get a little bit for me while you're at it. - Would you... Hey! Hold it! Fucker! What's going on, man? Sick or something? Looks like you got gut-kicked. - It's... It's... It's Helen. - Helen. It has something to do with Helen, I'm guessing. Helen... - Helen... - Helen... Helen is having an affair. Welcome to the club, man. - It can't be. Not Helen. - Nobody thinks it can happen to them the first time, buddy. - It can't be. - Same exact thing happened to me with wife number two, remember? I had no idea nothing was going on, right? I come home one day and the house is completely empty. And I mean completely empty. She even took the ice cube trays out of the freezer. What kind of a sick bitch takes the ice cube trays out of the freezer? - Not Helen. - Hey, Harry. Hey, listen, Helen still loves you. You know, she just wants to bang this guy for a while, you know. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it soon. Stop cheering me up! What'd you expect, Harry? Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman and you're never there. It was just a matter of time. You know what? I say we concentrate on work, buddy. That's what I do every time my life turns to dog shit. I concentrate on work, and that gets me by. All right, buddy? It's gonna be great. You know what? We're gonna catch some terrorists. We're gonna beat the crap out of them. You're gonna feel a hell of a lot better. All right. Watch your head now. Watch your head. Watch your head. Okay. All right. Women. Can't live with them, can't kill them. I came by your office today. I was in the area, and I thought that you might want to have lunch. Really? Well, you must have just missed me. That's what they said. They said you had to run out or something like that. It was this rush job... They needed these documents down at the district courthouse. And so, of course, the big problem, our printer shut down. So I went to the third floor to use theirs, but they have the 1720. And of course, the disk isn't formatted for the 1720. So I had to go back upstairs and reformat, go back downstairs and use their printer, and by the time I got there, 'cause I couldn't get my car to start, and then, well, traffic... I barely got there. So a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did it work out okay? Yeah. Great. I'll check on dessert. I'm done. See, now, the great thing is that he's practically given us a blank check on wiretaps. So, I've set them up on all of Juno's shipping agents and her clients. And Faisil's made a list of all the possible contacts the Crimson Jihad may have in this country. So now all we got to do is sit around... Hey, this national security stuff boring you? Put a tap on her phone. What are you talking about? I already did that. I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap on her office line and the line at my house. Do it now. Okay. All right. Just come over here for a second. That sounds great. I just want to ask you about something. Listen, I got two words to describe that idea. In-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's a felony, pard. You know what... And we're doing it 20 times a day, so don't give me that crap. Do it. - Hello? - Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk? Yes, go ahead. Listen, I can't talk long. Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow? I must see you. I suppose so. Where? Same place, 1:00. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you. I thought that we might have lunch together tomorrow. You know, darn it, I'm gonna meet Allison. We're gonna go shopping. Sorry. No problem. You know what? I think you're going about this whole thing all wrong. You see, women, they like you to talk to them, you know. And maybe it's just that you're not in touch with your feminine side. I was watching Sally Jessy Raphael... All right. Okay. I got all the usual stuff here. I got a telemetry-burst transmitter. I've got a GPS tracker. I got an audio transmitter and a power supply, and I've got it sewn into the lining here, and now... Hey, Harry? And if you need to talk, speak into the purse. Okay. Here she comes. She's gonna pop out right in front of us. Watch this. - Bingo. - Yep. Looks like she's going into Chinatown. Okay. She's parking. Okay, give me audio. You sure you weren't followed? No. I mean, I kept looking behind me like you taught me, but I didn't see anyone. Okay, it's just that things are a bit hot right now. If I get a signal, I may have to leave suddenly. I understand. Look, it's my job to take risks, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into all this, but you're the only one I can trust. Were you out on a mission? We say op, covert operation. And this one, well, got a little rough. - Worse than Cairo? - Cairo. Cairo was a day at the beach next to this. - The guy's a spook. - But for whom? He could be working her to get to you. - Did you read the papers yesterday? - Yes. Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation. You see two men killed in a restroom and two unidentified men in a running shootout, ending at the Marriott? That was you? - Me. - You see, you're very good. You recognized my style. You're a natural at this. The guy's a fake, man. He's taking credit for our moves. - What happened? - Hardly worth talking about. Two of them won't bother me again. Unbelievable. - You chased one? - Something came over me. I just had to nail this guy no matter what the risk. Pretty hairy. I thought he had me a couple of times, but I... - I really can't take credit. - Well, why not? It's the training. It shapes you into a lethal instrument. You react in a microsecond without thinking. I'm starting to like this guy. We still got to kill him. I mean, that's a given, you know. The guy is a goddamn used car salesman. I mean this keeps getting better and better! I'm sorry, Harry. I know this has gotta be painful. But you gotta admit, it's pretty damn funny. I mean, if it was just some idiot and not you, you'd be laughing your ass off. I mean, this is... One born every minute. It wants you too. Feel it vibrate? - Say, how about a little spin? - Sure. See, it's not just a car. It's a total image, an identity. You have to go for it. This isn't some high-tech sports car. To tell you the truth, it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it? What are we talking about here? Pussy, right? Absolutely. Let's face it, Harry. The 'vette gets them wet. But it's not enough. If you really want to close escrow, well, you got to have an angle. - I suppose you have an angle. - It's killer. I mean, look at me. I'm not that much to look at. No, no, no. I can be honest. But I got them lining up, and not just the skanks either. - Well, some are. - So, what's your angle? No, sorry. Trade secret. Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives married to the same guy for years. They're stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure, a hint of danger. I create that for them. So basically you're lying your ass off the whole time. - You see, I couldn't do that. - What are you, a Boy Scout? No, no. Think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. I mean, you gotta work on their dreams, get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours. - What about their husbands? - Dickless! I mean, let's face it, if they took care of business, I'd be out of business, you know what I mean? Those idiots. Hey! Hey, you mind keeping it under 90? I'm still trying to pay for this dental work. So, who are you working on right now? I always got a couple on the hook, you know. There's this one right now, I got her panting like a dog. - It's great. - What does she do? Some sort of legal secretary or something. You know, uptight and conservative. But she could be so hot if she wanted to be. And with you, she gets to be real hot, huh? - Red hot! - Yeah. Her thighs steam. It's like a dying plant. Just needs a little water. - Married to some boring jerk. - Married to some boring jerk? Yeah, you know, he doesn't appreciate her. She's like all these babes. You get their pilot lit, they can suck-start a leaf blower. God! She's got the most incredible body, and a pair of titties, make you want to stand up and beg for buttermilk. Ass like a 10-year-old boy. So, then she must be really good in bed then? Hey! Slow down. You're gonna miss the turn. See? You and this car were made for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I got a couple other buyers on the line, but I like your style. So, what do you say? Should we start up the paperwork? Let me think about it. Hold it for me for a day, okay? Hey, because it's you. I got today's transcripts. Not much going on. - Nothing from Simon? - No. - My turn to drive? - Give me the page. - What are you talking about? - It jumped from page 9 to page 11. - Where's page 10? - It's gotta be a typo. Give me the goddamn page! Okay. Seek help, Harry. - Hello? - Helen, I need your help. - Can you meet me tonight? - What's happened? It's serious. Meet me on K Street under the Key Bridge, 8:00 sharp. Gotcha. Shit. It's almost 8:00. - She's still at the house. - The purse is still at the house. Shit. Unit Two, Unit Seven, immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. Vehicle is red-and-white convertible and you've got exactly six minutes. Hey, wait a minute, man. Are you out of your mind? You can't pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife. That's a misappropriation of sector resources, and it's a breach of national security. You copy, Harry? Hey, you're losing it big-time, man. - I have to stop you. - What are you gonna do, tell? Look, God damn it, Harry! Both of our butts are on the line here, okay? So your life's in the crapper. So your wife's banging a used car salesman. It's humiliating, I know, but God damn it, take it like a man! - You tell on me, I tell on you. - What are you talking about? I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets. I'm as clean as a baby's... What about the time you blew a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow job? You knew about that? All right. Let's take Franklin. It's a lot quicker. Quick, get in. Hurry up. Let's go. Two here. Suspect vehicle in sight. One male, one female. Now, don't be alarmed. If I'm spotted, it'd be best if they didn't see you. You should keep your head down till we're out of the city. Here, let me help you. That's better. Okay. Now the woman has her head in the guy's lap. Southbound on the Key Bridge. Two in pursuit. Roger, Two. One to Condor, you got a visual? Roger, One. This is Condor. Subject is in sight. Repeat, we have the ball. We got a pretty good lock-up on the infrared. Yeah, she's got her head in the guy's lap all right. Yahoo! Maybe she's sleepy. Okay. This is a safe house. My place in the city is just a little too hot right now. So is the penthouse in New York. What is it exactly you need me to do? Helen, I want you to be my wife. But I'm married! No. It's just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man travelling alone. - You want me to go to Paris? - Paris, with a quick stopover in London. Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit. I don't know who. There's no one I can trust except you. Can you get away, just for a couple of days? I just don't know. Of course. I'm rushing you. Forgive me. - Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. - Okay. Let me pour you some more wine. Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. You just saved my life. You are incredibly brave. I have to remind myself of the fear you must be feeling. You see, for me fear is not an option. Now, in order to pull this cover story off, we have to look like two people who are completely intimate with each other. The enemy can spot a fake easily. - You see what I mean? - Sorry. That reaction could get us both killed. - I'm sorry. - We can't afford that. - No. I'm sorry. It's... - Try to relax. It's just been a long time since anybody but Harry's touched me like that. - It's a little difficult. - I know. I know, I know. - It's awkward for me too. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. Just sit back. - I'm okay. There. That's better. Just let yourself slip into the role. That's it. There you go. Just let yourself go. Yeah, that's good. That's great. That's it. No, I can't do this. I can't do this. - What's wrong? It's okay. - No, I cannot do this. I cannot do this! If not for me, do it for your country? Oh, God. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. I'll do whatever you want. Please. I didn't do anything. Oh, no. God damn it. No! Take her. Take her. Oh, God, don't hurt me. Son of a bitch! Sit down. I said sit down. Who do you work for? Stern, Kessler, Goldstein and Krupnik. - I'm just a legal secretary. - Sure, Mrs. Tasker. What were you doing with the international terrorist Carlos the Jackal, taking dictation? How long have you been a member of his faction? I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon, or whoever you say he is, just a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him. That's not what it looked like when we found you. How did you meet him? Well... Keep this for me. I can't afford to be taken with it. - What? - It's a matter of national security. - No. - Please, it's important. I'll contact you. Shit. Why did you continue to see him? He said he needed my help. Not because you were attracted to him? No. You mean, you were not attracted to him at all? No. Well, maybe just a little. - So, is cheating a common thing for you? - No, never. So you're telling me this was your first time? I wasn't cheating. Tell me about your husband, Mrs. Tasker. Harry? I... What can I say about Harry? I mean, he's a sales rep for a computer company. So sex with him isn't exactly waving your flag anymore? That is none of your goddamn business. Now, what kind of questions are these? You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details about your life, you'd better tell us. My husband is a good man. But he's not exactly ringing your bell these days, is he? Let me handle this part. I mean, do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout? He wanted me to go to Paris with him on a mission, to pose as his wife. And you agreed? Why? I don't know. I guess I needed something. What did you need? I needed to feel alive. I just wanted to do something outrageous. And it felt really good to be needed. And to be trusted. And to be special. It's just that there's so much I wanted to do with this life, and it's like I haven't done any of it. And the sand's running out of the hourglass, and I just wanted to be able to look back and say... See? I did that! I was reckless, and I was wild, and I fucking did it! Quite frankly, I don't give a shit whether you understand that or not. This Simon, did you sleep with him? - No. - She's lying. You mean, you did not have sexual relations with him? Listen, if you're gonna ask me every question twice, this is gonna take a really long time, and I have to get back to my family. You're not going anywhere, lady. Just let me out of here! Answer the question. Answer the question! No! I did not sleep with him! Calm down, please. Do you hear me, you chicken-shit bastard? - Calm down. - She could be telling the truth. Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. Calm down, please. I've only one more question, Mrs. Tasker. What? Do you still love your husband? Yes, I love him. I've always loved him, and I will always love him. She loves you. Now what? There's only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us. What are you doing, Harry? - Just giving her a little assignment. - You gotta be shitting me! She wants a little adventure, so I'm gonna give her one. I'm offering you a choice. If you work for us, we will drop the charges, and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to a federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your life will be destroyed. Gee, let me think. Yes or no? Of course, yes. What's involved? You will be contacted with the assignment. The code name of your contact will be Boris. And your code name will be... - Natasha? - No. Doris. You pricks! You son of a bitch. Did you think you could elude us forever, Carlos? Wait. You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Look, look, just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your face... Oh, shit! Don't, don't... No, I didn't see it! I didn't see it! It's you. Hey, you still interested in that 'vette at all? Hey, Carlos. The game's over. Your career as an international terrorist has been well-documented. - No. No, no. No, no. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I sell cars. That's all! Come on. I'm not a terrorist. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever saw a gun, I'd... Oh, God! Please, don't. Don't, don't, don't kill me. I'm not a spy. I'm nothing. I'm navel lint. I have to lie to women to get laid, and I don't score much. I got a little dick. It's pathetic. Oh, God. Would a spy pee himself? Oh, God! Please, I'm not worth a bullet. - Mercy, sir. - Get the fuck out of here. Just beat it. Go on. No, no. As soon as I turn, you're gonna shoot me. You're gonna shoot me. You're gonna shoot me. Please. You can have the car for free. What do you say? Get lost, dipshit. So last night must've been pretty exciting for you. My flat tire was... Actually, it was a little scary because the tow truck driver took such a long time. I'll get it. - Hello? - Doris? Yes? - Yes? - Listen carefully. In exactly one hour, go to the Hotel Marquis. Pick up an envelope marked "Doris" at the front desk and dress sexy. What? Hello? No, no. Turn around. Do it doucement. Do it very slowly. You've reached a new all-time low with this one, I'll tell you. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the suite at the Marquis. Do you think I can afford a suite like this with my salary? - Now, Jean-Claude, is he done yet? - Hang on. Who wrote this shit? Harry? It's going great. Hi. Do you have an envelope for Doris? This is Doris. Listen, you are a prostitute named Michelle. Go to the room. There will be a man there. He is a suspected arms dealer. No, wait a minute, wait. You don't expect me to, you know... No. He has particular tastes. He likes to watch. Tell him that his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you, he will tell you what to do. You must plant the bug near the telephone by the bed before you leave. If you do not complete your mission, the deal is off. I'm gonna go to hell. Hello? Hello. Have some champagne. Come in here. My name is Michelle. Carla thought you'd like me. Let me do the talking. You may start by unzipping your dress. No, no. Turn around. Do it doucement. Do it very slowly. Good. Now slip the dress down slowly. Good. Now slide your nylons off, one by one. - I'm not wearing any. - That's good. Now dance for me. No, no, no. Dance sexy. Let your hands be your lover's hands on your own skin as you move. Now lie on the bed and close your eyes. I thought you only liked to watch. Now lie on the bed and close your eyes. You pig! Bastard! Helen, Helen, wait, wait, wait. Harry. Yes, it's Harry. I know it looks bad, but I can explain. Nobody move! Don't move! Helen, just don't do anything. No, he has nothing to do with it. I'm the one you want. - Shut up! - Okay. Quiet, Helen. Do what they say. Come on, guys. Let the hooker go. She's not important. You don't need her. - Harry, please, just let me handle this. - Shut up! What were you doing there? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Talk again, I'll kill you! Harry. I wish I could say it's nice to see you again, Juno. You know her? You know, this shade's totally wrong for you. So who's your little friend? I'm Helen Tasker. Harry is my husband. And you are? So now it's Tasker, not Renquist. She's just some wacko hooker that I met down at the bar. Harry, what is the matter with you? Just tell her the truth. We are married, and we have a daughter. I don't know what the crazy bitch is on. You should cut her loose so we can get down to business. Yeah? Yeah? Well, where did I get this then? Where did I get this? Something before takeoff? That hurt, you... She was telling the truth, wasn't she, Harry? She really doesn't know. How interesting. Bring them. Incredible, aren't they? I call them the Four Horsemen. They're warrior figures from the Persian Empire of Darius I, around 500 BC. They're absolutely priceless. Pity. Wait, wait! Open it. Do you know what this is? I know what this is. This is an espresso machine. No, no, no. It's a snow-cone maker. That's what it is. Is it a water heater? Do you know why you've been brought here? So that this man can verify to the world, the Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power. But how can he do that? He is just a salesman, for Christ's sake. If I'm wrong about him, the last thing you'll see will be your blood spraying across his face. It's a Soviet MIRV-6 from an SS-22N launch vehicle. The warhead contains 14.5 kilograms of enriched uranium and a plutonium trigger. The nominal yield is 30 kilotons. What can I say? I'm a spy. You bastard! You lying son of a bitch! - Sorry, honey. - Don't you call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again! Do you understand me, you pig? And I can verify that they have the arming box and all the equipment necessary to detonate all four warheads. You have killed our women and our children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and you dare to call us terrorists? Now the oppressed have been given a mighty sword with which to strike back at their enemies. Unless you, America, pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until our demands are met. First, we will detonate one weapon on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of our power and Crimson Jihad's willingness to be humanitarian. However, if these demands are not met, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major American city each week... Battery, Aziz. Get another one, you moron. I think I have one in the truck. - What? - Look at this. - That's not mine. - Nice transmitter. Miami Tower, Jet Star 6479 Delta on final. - We'll be on the ground in 12 minutes. - All right. Hey, tell those DEA boys to have the helos hot and ready to fly in 12 minutes. Signal's definitely stopped moving. It's an island in the Keys out past Marathon. - We lost the signal. - Shit! All right, everyone. This is Samir. For 50 points, see if you can guess his speciality. Oral hygiene? Not exactly. Harry, what's going on? Samir's just gonna ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir's absolutely first-class. On the other hand, we have Harry here who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it'll be interesting to see how long he can resist. This will help. You know, you should swab that with alcohol. I might get an infection. I'll return when this has taken effect. Then we'll talk. I'm looking forward to it. Now, why are you helping these raving psychotics? Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics and I'm getting a lot of money. What, you think I care about their cause? Or yours? Not at all. You're damaged goods, lady. Did you tell her about us, Harry? There is no us, you psychopathic bitch. Sure. Say that now. Thanks for everything, Harry. It wasn't bad while it lasted. Let's go. You two stay here. There was nothing. I swear. What did they give you? Sodium amytal or some other truth agent. It makes you tell the truth? Is it working? Ask me a question that I normally would lie to. - Are we gonna die? - Yep. I'd say it's working. They're gonna shoot us in the head, or they're gonna torture us to death. Okay. Or they're gonna leave us here until the bomb blows up. Harry! How long have you been a spy, Harry? Seventeen years. Have you ever killed anyone? Yeah, but they were all bad. Is there anything you want to tell me before we start? Yeah. I'm going to kill you pretty soon. I see. How, exactly? First, I'm going to use you as a human shield. Then I'm going to kill this guard over there with the Patterson trocar on the table. And then I was thinking about breaking your neck. And what makes you think you can do all that? You know my handcuffs? I picked them. Let's get out of here. Come on! Harry! Drop the gun! Honey, next time, duck. - Let's go. - I married Rambo. What are they doing? It is done. In 90 minutes, a pillar of holy fire will light up the skies to show to the world that we speak the truth. We are set on our course. No force can stop us now. We're cool. We're bad-asses, blah, blah, blah, blah. If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? We must be in the Florida Keys. The overseas highway connects all the islands to the mainland. There's no borders, no customs. They can go anywhere in the US. There's nothing to stop them. Just us. - Here, take this. - Oh, shit. Shoot! Shit! Shit. Shit! Yes! Let's go. My condolences to the widow. We may need a hostage. Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker. Hurry up, you idiot! Just get her in the car. Let's get going. - I thought this looked like your work. - Let's go. I'll brief you in the air. You're welcome. Let's go! Let's get out of here! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Go! Well, you tell that son of a bitch this is a Bright Boy Alert. I repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. This is not a drill. Do you understand that? All right. Hold on. Put me through to the White House. No, see, the minimum safe distance is 12 miles. Get the Marine Patrol in it right away. I want the Coast Guard, and I want the Sheriff's Department too. Anyone that cannot make that distance, you gotta get them out by air. Okay. You've got exactly 34 minutes. Wait one. I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers here in 11 minutes. They're on maneuvers outside of NAS Key West. Get them. I'll brief them on the way in. Okay. Send them in right away. Would you like one? I want the state police driving through the streets, okay, on their damn loudspeakers. Hey, here they come. Lime-Zero-One, got a tally on three trucks eastbound on the bridge. Roger, Lime-Zero-One. You're clear to engage. Ringo is padlocked. In hot with guns. Let's get some. Okay, Marines, it's time to kick ass. Recommend using your Mavericks to take out the bridge. Roger that. Lime flight, switch Mavericks. Two. These missiles won't set off those nukes, will they? Negative. That's a negative Lime-Zero-One. Fire. - Bingo! - Good shooting, Marines. I'll kill you! - It's out of control. - Looks like somebody capped the driver. Bitch! Like one? How about two? Get down to the limo! Come on! Take it down! Let's go! - Get down! - Get down. Take it down. All right. Harry! Harry! - The bridge is out! - What? The bridge is out! I can't hear you! What? Oh, God! The bridge is out! The bridge is out, Harry! Hurry! Come on! Come on! Speed up a little bit, now. Get down there. Come on! Hurry! Hurry, Harry! - I... I can't reach. - Grab my hand! - Come back! Harry! - Grab my hand! Okay, to the right, to the right. Go back. - I can't reach! Get lower! - Come on! Lower, Harry! - Here we go! Hold on! - Okay. Hold on really tight! Harry! Harry! Come back! Pull up, pull up, pull up! Grab my hand! You can do it! - Try! Come on, try again. - I can't reach! Closer! - God, Harry! Please! Harry! - Come on! Come on, hurry! Oh, shit! Come on, baby. Hold on! I got you! - Oh, God! - Hold on tight! Harry! Okay, let's get this thing on the ground. All right. Let's get these aircraft on the ground, gentlemen. We got a nuclear bomb going off in about one minute. Stage one clear. - Any minute now. - All right. I know. Go, go, go. Come here. Give me a bullhorn. All right, everybody, it's show time. Do not look at the flash! Do not look at the flash! Get down over there! Do not look at the flash! We should be safe here. This is the wrong finger. Harry. Hey, Harry, come here! - Go to work. - Okay. Bye. - Okay, all right. - What? Listen, Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes ago - on top of a high-rise in down town Miami. - It's right here. That's where he rendezvoused with a dozen other faction members, and they're holed up on the 20th floor. Now I got SWAT down there, and the cops cordoned off the area. Harry, they got a hostage. It's Dana. What do you mean? My Dana? I'm real sorry. Harry. I don't know what to say. I guess he grabbed her in the middle of the night. I had no idea. We just found out about it. But I'll tell you what, I don't want you to worry, 'cause we're gonna get her back. I've already got a guy on the inside... Harry, listen, come here. We're gonna get her back. Here we go. Excuse me, Captain. I gotta borrow your plane for a minute, okay? Listen, Force Com, they cleared you to give us total cooperation. - Am I right? - Yes, sir, but... And you know that that comes directly from the President of these United States, Captain? But, sir, you're gonna have to sign for this aircraft. I'll sign for it. You got a pen? You take care of it, would you? Hey, Harry, do you realize that it has in fact been 10 years since you've been behind the wheel of one of these things? If I break it, they can take it out of my pay. Harry, listen, don't worry about it. We got a guy on the inside, Harry. Got to move back, everybody! Come on, let's go! What are you doing? All right, everybody, it's gonna be all right! It's gonna be okay. He's got hundreds of hours in the Harriers there. He is a little rusty right now, but that's a trademark Tasker takeoff, I gotta be honest with you. It's like riding a bike. You never forget, really. We might want to seek shelter! Sorry. Fuck! The streets are filled with running people as the police try to evacuate the buildings. They're firing again. ...appear to be shooting wildly into the air as I'm speaking. Now, these seem to be warning shots. So far, they have not fired at us or the police... This apparently is the same group which just detonated a nuclear bomb in the Florida Keys... Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until our demands are met. This tape was released to the media just minutes after the terrorists... I have to go to the bathroom. We'll repeat the tape in just a few moments following this live report from the scene. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! - The video crew you wanted is here! - Send them! They're coming in. They're unarmed. Come on. Let's go. Go. This is a communiqué from Crimson Jihad. You have seen a demonstration of our power. Do not force us to destroy this city, and do not try to use force against us. I, we, are all prepared to die. With one turn of that key, 2 million of your people will die instantly! - What key? - That key! Who's taken the key? Shoot her! Holy shit! Unit One to Unit Seven. Give me a situation report. One to Seven. Give me a sit rep. Faisil, do you copy? Seven here, 21st floor secure. About 12 faction members on the 20th floor. No hostages there. - Where's Dana? - She's on the roof. Okay, stay put. And give me that address again. You shoot me, this'll fall! Stay where you are! Stay where you are! Give me the key! - I'll drop it, I swear! - No! Give me the key. Come on, child. You don't want to die, do you? Give me the key, and you won't get hurt. I give you my word! No way, you wacko! Help me! Please, don't come any closer! Help me! Help me! Somebody! Help me! Help me! Please, help me, somebody! Dana, jump down! Jump! Come on down. Jump down! Dad? Help me! Daddy! Daddy, come back! Daddy, help me! Daddy, get me down! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, help me! - Dana, jump! Jump! Daddy will catch you! - Daddy, I can't... - Jump! - I can't! Hold on! Hold on! Daddy, don't you let me fall, please! - Daddy! - Dana, I got you! I'm slipping! - Daddy! - No! Dana! - Hold on! - Help me! I'm gonna fall! Daddy! Come on, hold my hand! Hold on tight, honey. Daddy, he's behind you! Take this plane down, now, or I'll kill her! Take it down, now! Oh, my God, do something! You're fired. It's okay. Dana, honey, it's over. Hi, pumpkin. Just seconds after the jet landed, the unidentified pilot was escorted from the scene by federal agents. Though it is unclear at this moment which agency was responsible for the operation which ended the terrorist threat so dramatically early this morning, we've learned from Miami Police... - One, two, three... - No, wait, stop. Just begin. Now, watch. - Okay, fine. But do it at the same time. - Okay, ready? Do it properly. One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war. Five, six, seven, eight, try to keep your thumbs straight. - Dad, wait! Stop! - Hey! - You have to wait! - I got you! - Right. Just listen. Listen to the rules. - Okay, here. Okay, again. - One, two three... - One, two, three... No, start over. - Hello? - Boris and Doris? We're on. Yes. Go ahead. Colonel, how nice to see you again. Good evening. Who was that? So, what's the scoop, team? You see your contact yet? Haven't seen him yet. But I see somebody I'd like to say hello to. Here. Let me pour you some more champagne. I gotta keep up the waiter bit. These stakeouts can be tricky, you know. You never know when things might explode into a life-or-death situation. If it gets rough, just stay low until it's over, and I'll contact you later. - Maybe you should give me your... - So, we meet again, Carlos. Honey, I'm just gonna do him right here, okay? Go for it. Oh, God. Fear is not an option. Dance? - Oh, no. - Tango. Oh, shit. Here we go. Harry? Helen? Guys? Come on, now. Let's not get distracted. We got some work to do. All right, guys. Come on. You guys better get serious in there. I'd be serious if I was in there. Don't ignore me, Harry. That's rude. All right, guys. Come on. National security, guys. Come on. Life and death. Harry? Harry? Helen? Helen, I was always on your side. I was always there for you, Helen. You know what? I'm sick of being in the van. You guys are gonna be in the van next time. I've been in the van for 15 years, Harry.
