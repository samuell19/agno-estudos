Mr Adam's is taking my unloading duties, that alright with you sir? Oh that's OK Mr Stevens. Thank you sir. Looking forward to seeing your brother? Sure am, been a long time. By the way what's he doing in London? He works for a travel agency, sort of a courier. Sure gets around Paris, Rome, Madrid. He wouldn't be a land lover with all those rail road tickets. Thank you sir. Are you going ashore already? - Have special approval from the captain. - How come? Well I recommended him for promotion. Well enjoy yourself. Thanks, oh but Bill, thanks for taking over. Ah it's nothing. If you see my brother tell him I'm staying at his hotel. - Yeah sure. - Thanks. Hey Grey? Yeah? We sail in 4 days time. Don't forget will you? Don't worry I won't. Yes sir? Do you have a Larry Stevens staying here? Stevens? We did have a Mr Stevens with us but he left about 6 months ago. - 6 Months? - Yes he left quite suddenly. - He didn't leave an address or anything? - No sir. I'm holding two letter for him in case he shows up. - May I see them? - Yes of course. - Thanks. These are what I wrote myself, I'm his brother may I take charge of these? Yes of course sir. Thanks, you got a single room? Yes that could be arranged. That's all? Fine. Will you take charge of this bag for me and I'll check in later. - There you go sir. - Thank you. That'll be 12 pounds. Yes sir? I'd like to see the manager please. I'm afraid Mr Harris is away sir. How long will he be gone? He'll be gone for 2 or 3 days sir, can I help you? Oh I'm trying to locate a fellow named Larry Stevens. He used to work here. Here's a reference that was left at his hotel that wasn't picked up. No where I can find him? Well I've only been here a few weeks myself sir. The rest of the staff have gone. Well erm, don't you have any records? I'll look in the personnel book sir. Why were you inquiring about Larry Stevens? Why do you know him? I did, slightly. He's my brother but you know where I can find him? Well I... Well? I'm sorry I must have been thinking of someone else. But... Your ticket miss. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm sorry sir there's no record of Mr Stevens here. Well do you think he might be at some other branch? He wouldn't have to come if his reference has been transferred. - I'm sorry. - Thanks. Hotel Butler. Got a light? A light? Yes sure... Thanks. That's alright. You can keep them. Hey. Why are you following me? Following you? You must be out of your mind I never saw you before. Come here! I never saw you before. Let go of me or there will be trouble. There is trouble. Now wait a minute. Give me a break. I'm in a difficult position you understand? If I open my mouth, and a talk him, he finds out about it, he'll kill me. Who'll kill you? I'm not in a position to disclose that. Don't worry nobody's going to kill you. If they do I'll speak sharply to them. Excuse me sir, are you a member? - Why not? - Oh thank you sir. I didn't recognise you. - He's here. - Who? Brother Stevens. I thought I told you to pull him. He caught up with me. Oh yes? Didn't find enough of me though. You're much to smart aren't you? You just let him tell you. Alright I'll handle him. I saw her this afternoon in the worldwide travel agency. Hmm. She spoke to Stevens. I that so? She was booking herself a ticket to some place... There's no way out... there's no escape, from you... there's no way out... whatever I may do. As time goes by, I realise more and more... It's you and you alone at dawn. I know that there's no way out... which ever way I turn, I wear a smile, though the tears may burn. And yet I know, beyond the shadow of a doubt... for me there's no escape... There he is at the end of the bar. Keep out of sight. May I introduce myself? Go ahead. My name is Setgo. Usual please. Haven't seen you around before. I haven't been around. Though the tears may burn... I tried to. Very... what's on your mind? I just like to say hello to new customers. Hello. Let's put our cards on the table shall we Mr Stevens. You're looking for your brother aren't you? So? So... One of my advice is don't. What are you driving at? Look I'm speaking as a friend of your brothers, and I hope of yours. Why don't you start making some sense? All I can tell you is this... Larry's in trouble. Oh? Who with? With the police. You see Larry was a member of this club. But I'm afraid he abused the hospitality. Yeah? How? He introduced undecidable characters Mr Stevens. He was in couples with dealings... Past stolen property. But as I say, I like the boy. I did him a number of good terms, and that was the way he showed his gratitude. The kindest thing for me to do is warn you not to look for him. - And now if you'll excuse me... - Wait a second. If you find your brother, the police may be just one jump ahead of you. Is that a threat? Have a drink on the house. We've got a nice show coming up, why don't you stay and enjoy yourself. Look after him. Thank you sir. Who is it? Stevens may I come in? What can I do for you? Seems like I'm on home ground I see and action again. I like hearing it myself. Look you started to be helpful this afternoon, why did you stop? I thought I knew the person you were inquiring about. Well you had the name right Larry Stevens. I made a mistake. Now if you'll excuse me I have to change for my next number. Suppose you carry on where you left off this afternoon. There is nothing I can tell you. You're scared of something aren't you? What is it? Alright look, give me a lead, anything... some friend of Larry's someone I can talk to. There's a box up at the name of Dave Larry, he's firing at the Gran stadium tonight. He knew your brother than I did. How did you get to know Larry? Just came Miss. Thank you. Ed Leary eh? Well thanks to something. Which one's Leary? The one in the right corner. He's a good boy that, he's going places. Now you're boxing well Dave, keep moving around, use your left hand but watch his right. That's alright Eddy boy you can ring up your mum and tell him you'll be home early. - You alright? - He'll be alright Brad. What round was that? Five. Never thought Barnie could take it. You just got in? Yeah. You missed all the act. Wait for him next one. You know him? Yeah... who? Larry. I knew him when he was in the boxing booze. You know, the fairground. - Chip? - No thanks. It's gonna be quite a round. What a slogging match! My name's Colin. Stevenson. Glad to know you Stevens. - An American aren't ya? - Yeah. Stevens, no relation to these Stevens are ya? Yes he's on the ropes! Come on! - Come on. - What are you talking about? What Stevens? Larry's team of course, the management. Come on, keep him busy! What did you say? What's the matter with you? Watch the fight will you! What's this about Larry Stevens? Answer me! Hey let me go! I wanna know! Don't you read the flaming news papers? That was about Stevens this week. Friend of Dave Leary. A yank, like you. But wouldn't have mentioned it. Take your hands off me. I just wanna watch the fight. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 89, 10, out! Well... that's another win to Dave Leary, the end came... Well don't bother to knock will you. Thanks I won't. I hear you talked to Stevens this afternoon. I mean the one their not going to hang. He gets around doesn't he? He earns his keep. Just about. Would you mind putting that down please? Pretty sensitive about your father aren't you? What are you going to Paris for? To see him? - Perhaps. - Tonight? I'm surprised Crowson didn't tell you that. My plane leaves at midnight. Crowson did tell me. You would be on the plane my sweetheart, I've canceled the booking. You what? You are under contract. There are certain things you can't do, like flying to Paris. Suppose you cracked up I'd be lost without you. Why don't you be sensible. You're not helping your father by running out on me. You're not helping him by staying. Well we did it again Tommy boy. Straight in just you drew it on the plan. - We're well on our way tom. - Come in. - Nice going fella. - Ah thanks glad you liked it. Here, you a reporter? I've got something you can right. I've got muscles I haven't even used yet. And you know? I've had 482 fights in my career. 42 of them with men. 42 of them with men. Get it? Sorry I'm not a reporter I just wanna talk to you for a moment. Well yeah, make yourself at home. Thanks. I was just telling Tom about the fight. It worked a treat. I could have stopped him in the third but I took it to the sixth. You gotta give them a show for their money. Are you sure you're not a reporter? Quite sure. Can I do anything for you? Maybe, I hear you're a friend of Larry Stevens. What did you say? I said I hear you're a friend of Larry Stevens. What is this. I'm Gregg Stevens Larry's brother. OK Tommy I can manage myself now. Only I'm thirsty, be a pal and go and get me a bottle of lemonade will you? There's a good lad. Ah he's a great little second Tommy. There's nothing about the fight game he doesn't know. The only trouble is he's muck and Jeff and sugar plum. That's old English for, deaf and dumb. I had some crazy talk when I was out there tonight. Somebody was saying that Larry was up on a murder wrap. Tonight? You mean you mean to say you only heard it tonight? That's right. Where have you been? See mostly, China waters. Shanghai, Hong Kong. Don't you get News Bullet paper? I didn't get that one. Oh what a reception for you. Yeah I know Larry we were buddies. Oh he's a nice kid. Hard to figure out though. You know, he never even mentioned he had a brother. Well is it true about the murder wrap I mean? Yes charm I'm afraid it is. When does he... Thursday. 3 days from now. Larry was a... crazy kid I know but... Who was it? He shot a man by the name of Williams. Manager of the Gay Mask club. You know it? Yeah. Larry phone me and told me to meet him there. He was just back from Paris. By the time I arrived the place was stiff with cops and... Larry was arrested. What was it all about? I don't know. Look pal, why don't you have a word with Larry's lawyer. Bloke by the name of Winslow. He'll be able to tell you all you need to know. Me? I might get things mixed up a bit. You'll want to see Larry, Winslow can fix that for you. Look... here's my car, I'll right Winslow's address on the back. And if there's anything I can do, you just look me up. Thanks. Oh and you will wish the kid the best of luck from me won't you. Yeah I'll do that. Thanks Tommy... Well we certainly put on on him tonight didn't we. Thanks boy. I'm afraid the case against your brother was quite conclusive. We did everything possible. He tried for an appeal. Actually... still a few things I don't understand Mr Winslow. For instance, I thought my brother was a member of the Gay Mask club but here it says that he worked for the place. Oh yes, natural developments wit the agent connections. Not unusual, he introduced parties to the club on a commission basis. Yes. According to the evidence here my brother went to the club about 10:30. He saw Williams and a choir was overheard. Overheard by who? One of the waiters. He alleged that your brother threatened Williams. Did anyone else hear the quarrel besides the waiter? Oh yes, Marios Setago, the owner of the place, and several of the guests. I see. At approximately 11pm Stevens went into see Williams. He's been drinking, shortly afterwards the waiter went to the office with a message. There was no reply and the door was locked. He thought something might be wrong and called Setago. They forced the door open and Williams was dead. He'd been shot. Steven was in a dazed condition the person who fired the fatal bullet was on the floor beside him. My brother never carried a gun. Who did it belong to, Williams? No, it was stolen property. Your brother's finger prints were the only ones over it. What did he have to say? He couldn't remember a thing that happened. Come in. Yes Miss. I spoke to Prison Governor. He said Mr Stevens can see his brother this morning. Good. - Was there any other news? - No sir. I see, thanks. We were hoping for news. Well I suppose you're pretty anxious to see him. Of course. I'll drive you down. Oh may I take this brief with me I want to look over it tonight. Certainly. Thanks. - Oh thanks for fixing that for me. - That's quite alright. What was the moto supposed to have been? Williams was a known smuggler. The police said he was that your brother was inveigled into the racket by him quarreled over money and erm... the rest you know. But what proof do they have that Larry was mixed up with Williams? Four uncut diamonds were found in your brothers pocket. Sit there please. Sit down here. Hello Larry. Hi. I wasn't expecting to see you. What happened? I didn't do it Gregor. I was sure I know you heard the facts though. They looked like the straight bill of goods. All I know is that I didn't shoot Williams. I believe you. Now just relax and tell me everything you know. Well I wanted to see Williams. Talk to him about some money he owed me. We quarreled some but not seriously. Next thing I know is I blacked out, must have been something I had in the drink. When I came too, the place was crowded with cops. What about the diamonds they found on you? I don't know anything about them, I don't know how they god there. Hmmm that looks bad. They must have been planted, that's the only way I can figure it. But why did they pick on you? I guess I was the fall guy. I made several trips of months to the continent for the travel agency. That made smuggling look easy for me. Whoever it was must have known that cops already had a line on Williams. Tying us both up was a natural. Was all this brought out of the trial? Yeah, theory, theory against hard established facts. Look... was there anything at all you remember while you were with Williams before you blacked out? Yeah there was something... What? - It doesn't make much sense... - Tell me anyway. A few bars from a song... While I was talking to Williams I seem to remember a girl voice singing. What girl? Evon, she works the club. Oh yeah I know her. Her father's the ship's captain. Right now he works for the Paris branch at the travel agency. Every time I went there he gave me presents for his daughter, candies mostly. Time's up sir. Is there anything else? No I'm afraid not. OK kid. Don't give up hoping, I'll be seeing you. You're gone... but you're everywhere. By the fire in your favourite chair. I still remember journeys, to places far and wild. Do come in Mr Stevens. OK Setago let's have a talk, why didn't you tell me where Larry was? Aren't you being a little foolish Mr Stevens? Let's talk about Larry why didn't you tell me he worked for you? Because he didn't. You're lying! Larry worked for you and you know it! He was hired by the man they say he killed. - Would you be good enough to let me go? - OK! Believe it or not Mr Stevens, but The Gay Mask club is quite respectable. Owing to this unfortunate case with your brother, it received a certain amount of Moriarty. All I want now is to let the past bury the past. Does that answer your question? It answers one of them your play mate answers the other. - What do you mean? - Never mind tell him Latin boy you're busy. I'm not busy. You are now! You framed my brother Setago! A spot of bother going on inside. I'm telling you Setago's a crook and he framed my brother. If you guys are on the ball you'll pinch him instead of me. Alright boys you can go. Sit down Mr Stevens have a cigarette. No thank you! I'm just trying to take things calmly. I know the sort of strain you're under but you're not helping matters by making a lot of wild accusations. OK inspector maybe I will have the cigarette. Now you're a sensible man Mr Stevens. Might you try and keep out of trouble? I'm not in any trouble. You will be if you go on this way. You say that Setago is a bad guy and that your brother's been unjustly convicted. Well what reasons can you give? - None yet... - Well then. Hello? Yes. Very well. Yes I got Stevens here with me now. Alright I'll tell him. Setago's dropping his charges against you. Alright? Yeah I expected that. End gov. Thanks. You alright? Yeah expected that too. Expected what? Erm... I'm OK thanks. Evon? You heard what happened tonight? I can see what happened, Sorry I missed it. That man means trouble, so you better watch your step. Where are you taking that? Home. OK I'll have them picked up. 14 Crowley Square please. Remember what I said to you. Watch my step. Sure. - Tell me something will you? - Mm hmm. Did Larry Stevens murder Williams? You heard what the jury said. I heard what you said. Hello there. I'm sorry. What do you want? Mind if I talk to you for a moment? - Well erm... - It will only take a moment. I saw Dave Leary. We had a nice little talk. I've been having quite a few of them lately but been getting in no place fair, you'll be surprised. That's too bad. Maybe you can tell me this. Why is Setago so worried about me? Is it because I am trying to save an innocent man from a hanging? I really wouldn't know. You don't have to say anything, just knock once for yes and twice for no and we'll keep our little secret inside these 4 walls. What's Setago got on you? Why is he so worried about me. - That's your father? - Yes it is. This the way you treat his friends? I don't know what you mean. Look. I have an idea you can help me if you would wanted to so why don't you? Could be for two reasons, A you're disinterested. B, you're too interested. Somehow I figure it's not A. You're talking in circles Mr Stevens. You were in the club the night of the murder and you won't even tell try to tell me what happened. Do you mind? OK sister have it your way. Oh darling I'm sorry I... Well good evening. Oh this is Mr Stevens. Miss Driers. How do you do? Mr William's last sectary I presume? You have an excellent memory Mr Stevens. It's very flattering. Not at all you left a great impression. Thank you. A small world isn't it? Well it takes all sorts. Well a solicitors sectary, a singer in a night club. I didn't know you girls were so chummy. Oh we've been friends since childhood. I bet you'd play nicely together. People used to say it was sweet to see it. I'll leave you to reminisce about the happy care free days of childhood. Don't get too nostalgic. I'm leaving myself in a moment. Perhaps I can drop you somewhere. Thanks I'll wait for you downstairs. What's he doing here. Oh he just called. Obviously. You know there is something about you bothers me. Really? You're not in Setago's racket from choice are you? No it's the only excuse I have for being in it at all. That's what bothers me. One word of advice darling. Don't forget which side you're batting on. Batting? I'm sorry national games always confuse me. I mean pitching. I just thought I'd mention it. So sweet of you to worry about me. You got something for me haven't you? Well? It's gone... What do you mean it's gone? I don't understand it I... I bought it in with me. You don't suppose... You're gonna have some explaining to do. Hi... I thought you were going to wait? I was in a hurry. OK jump in. I'm in a hurry myself. You saw your brother I suppose... Yeah I saw him. How was he? How was he? How do you think you'd be of you were going to be hanged for somebody else's murder? If it was somebody else's murder. It was! Where did you meet Evon? The Gay Mask Club didn't she tell you? That's quite a good spot if you happen to be on the right side of the manager. Oh what happens if you are on the wrong side? He can be very discouraging. Here we are. You should have mentioned that I don't live here. I should have told you that I do. Would you like a drink? No thanks. What are you afraid of? Me? No... just the drink. Goodnight. Goodnight. Taxi sir? Oh erm... yeah yeah. Butler Hotel. Yes sir. Hey driver I said the Butler Hotel. That's right sir. Well which way you going? It's alright sir you leave it to me. Hey the Butler hotel's on Perron Street. I know sir I'm taking a short cut. Hey take it easy will you. That's what we want boys. Alright the whiskey. What's the idea. I'm leaving. There's still a little matter of a contract. The kind of contract with a minor fee. It's a little late to think of that. It's never too late. What about your father? You're not looking after him so well. We'll take out chance. OK Sweetheart. Last night's little episode could have been a mistake. Don't make another one. Will you? How goes it? - OK fine. - Yeah? Well you keep them all happy. I'm just gonna have a look at my patient. Yeah keep that guard up son. Come on chum. Wakey wakey. I brought you some black coffee. You know that stuff with no head on it. Now now take it easy take it easy, don't dash about. You'll get a touch of the brewer's rash. Hey where am I? Hangover hall. As a matter of fact, it's my little home. What do you think of it? Lovely. How did I get here? Now don't tell me you can't remember anything. I don't remember coming here. You better watch that cut. As a matter of fact a couple of fellas came across you passed out in an alley way. Found my card in your pocket and brought you in. Set me back a quid. You must have been mixing your drinks a proper treat to get in that state. But if you're like this morning all you gotta do is just ring out your shirt. You ain?t just drinking chum you're weary. Felt wacky I was softened up. Ay? Beat up, pushed around you know...? Well tranced. Oh no you don't wanna fall in with that lark. Remember what they always say. One man's mit is another man's poison. Well if it ever happens again boy, always remember to turn the other cheek. And bring your knee up sharpish when you do it. Did they pitch anything? Hmm that money. I don't follow you son. That's all tied up with Larry and a little number called Launa Dryhurst. Dryhurst. Winslow's Secretary. Mean anything to you? Winslow. You know what you ought to do chum. Get in touch with the Rozzies. The who? The Police. Here's your coffee. Tell them what happened. Thanks. I wanna call Winslow first. Have him come down here. Well there's a blower chum help yourself. Telegram. I wanna send a telegram. To Mr John Deraf. Did you get a chance to look in that box? Hmm not that way that cabby was driving. I got a hunch it was loaded though Dave. You think it might have been Darmit's? Hmmm could be. Makes me swore and walking I smack into. You can't trust women you just can't trust them. Yeah, you can say that again. Hmmm time's running short. We'll have to think of something quick. You look as if you could do with a drink. What will it be, Brandy? Yeah that's fine. You know it's a funny thing, whenever I see a bottle of brandy, it reminds me of my old man. He thinks he's Nepolian. Here. Yeah... good luck then Josephine. Mr Winslow? You managed to find us then? He's through here. It's Mr Winslow. This is a bit unusual Mr Stevens, why bring me over here? I wanted to talk to you about your Secretary, Miss erm, Dryhurst. How long has she worked for you? Couldn't you have asked me that over the telephone? No. She's mixed up with Setago's mum. She's what? You arranged my brother's defense, she reported every move you made back to Setago. You like a drink Mr Winslow? No thanks. How do you know this? Something has happened that's convinced me that she helped frame my brother. She and Setago. What's happened? I found out the Gay Mask Club is a receiving deport for smuggle merchandise. Diamonds. Can you prove this? Last night I got worked on for sticking my neck out, I had something in my hand that would have given me all the proof I needed. But that last night. He's quite right Mr Winslow, he was dumped like a sack of potatoes when they were done with him. Look Winslow. I got about 18 hours to get what I need. I may need longer. Will you do something for me? Of course. Get me a stay of execution. Well without some form of concrete evidence that would be impossible. Well you can try couldn't you? The only person who can grant a stay of executions the home Secretary. But he can do nothing unless we can present him with new evidence. I'll dig up something. When a minute I got an idea... the home Secretary he's a fan of mine. He comes to all my fights. Now what if I ring him up and asking him for a personal favour? If what you say about my Secretary is true I better have her watched. Yeah who by? Detective agency? Sure... they'll tell us all we wanna know in about a year. You staying here Mr Stevens or can I drop you somewhere? Thanks, my hotel. So long Dave. - Thanks for everything. - Anytime pal. Only wish I'd been there last night, they may not have had quite such an easy time. Can I have my key please. Oh Mr Stevens. It's already upstairs sir... your rooms open. What? Yeah I hope it's alright sir. Young lady said it would be. Oh she did eh? What young lady. Well she didn't give her name sir. Well that's what I call service, thanks. May I come in? Sorry but you're a hard man to find. Thanks for the party last night. I haven't been in a party move for quite a while, tell me about yours. It happened right after I left your flat last night. Don't tell me it slipped your mind already? I hadn't had it in my mind, but I guessed you'd run into trouble. You guessed. It was silly of you to take that box while Launa was around. Maybe you didn't know it wasn't for eating. What's on your mind now? I'd come to tell you I'd like to help. What with, a knife? I haven't any. Take a look. Knife in my back already. Look stop me if I'm wrong. Your father sent you candy by special courier... each box contains a nice hard center that glissons. Right? Yeah that's right. You see my brother was one of the fall guys. That didn't put a can on the canon until I realised you wished I hadn't seen your father's picture. And then, everything fell right onto the line. Who peddled the diamonds you? I just take care of the wrapping. Donna picks it up and after that, the Candy and I lose sight of each other. Oh you sure must be proud of your old man. I'd like to see him stay alive. Yeah why? I don't blame you for being swore. But believe it or not I really wanna help. Well how nice. Before I met you I accepted the verdict on your brother like everyone else. They do? Probably because I didn't think enough about it. Except to feel sorry for a nice guy. But yesterday I begun to wonder. This morning I remembered something. My father was in the club that night Williams was murdered. Did you see him? No but last week he mentioned a song number. The one I sang that night for the first time. I thought he was in Paris. What was the name of that song? No way out. Well that's appropriate. Larry heard it too. It was in a sound proof room. That means Williams had his door open before he blacked out, somebody went in there after Larry. Maybe even your father. If my father murdered Williams he won't be coming from Paris to help us prove who did it. You mean you sent for him? Yes... OK so he didn't murder Williams, but he was mixed up with Setago. He dug the card from Paris. Nice boxes of candy, only not for eating. I passed the candy why don't you accuse me? This was addressed to you sir. Who brought it. I don't know sir, I was out of the office for a few minutes and I found it there when I got back. Play this Mr Stevens you'll find it of interest. James Smith. What is this a gag? I don't know anything about it sir. OK here. Thank you sir. If you want a radiogram there's one in the Lobby. Lobby. Thanks. Know anything about it? No but the man says play it. All it can do is explode. Please don't be surprised that I'm talking to you in this unusual fashion. There's a reason believe me. My name is James Smith. And I believe I am in a position to help you and your brother. If you'd like to contact me, go to the Jiffy snack bar in Nelson street. Ask the barman who's name is Percy, to put you in touch with me. He'll tell you where I can be found. Jiffy snack bar eh? Are you going? Course. Nothing else I can do until I see your father. Look. When he arrives, take him to your flat. Alright... We'll meet at Dave's gym. Don't worry I won't let you down. I don't know why, but some how I believe you. Take care of yourself. Thanks. Well you know how it is Mr K, take last years Darby. So I put all my money onto the next race, what happens? Down goes the lot. Ah good morning sir. And a very nice one too. What they like? Erm, coffee. Black or white? - Black. - Black. Then there was a turn up for the books... Number 2 comes out on the track like a rocket and gets to the first bend and then lays down. I've seen a beetle run faster. There we are sir, 4 pence please. Hey erm, your name Percy. Why yes, how do you guess? Come here... You know a guy named James Smith? Are you Stevens? Right. Well Jimmy's expecting you. Now just across the street here there's an alley way. You go down the end of it and you find yourself in a courtyard. Directly opposite that there's a door. That's the back entrance. For what? Go in there. You'll find out. No the grand national... 4 Years ago the grand national... I get up to the force, there's nowhere to live, it's pouring with rain... Excuse me, can you tell me where... What was that Mr Stevens? Well what do you know. I understand there's a Mr James Smith waiting here to see me. Yes in Mr Setago's office. You know the way don't you? Yeah I should. Come in. Ah good evening Mr Stevens. Smith? Yes sir sit down. What's the matter. Nothing. Just cautious. Nothing for you to worry. You are in no danger. Oh does that mean you are? Perhaps. I suspect you're wondering why I brought you here. Naturally. Cigarette? Oh don't bother. Ah... That's alright. Thank you. I'm afraid my affliction makes me rather clumsy at times. Yeah well how did you know where to contact me. Well if you don't mind... I'll do the talking. Time is getting rather short for both of us. About the murder. Williams was a very difficult man to work with. I should know, I'm a coven at the club. Williams quarreled with a great number of people. But one quarrel in particular I remember. I'm listening. It may not mean much... But William's death did this man quite a bit of good. What man? Setago. Mario Setago. Well if you knew all this how comes you didn't go to the police? Mr Stevens you'll see how it is with me... I'm in no position to move much. Literally a sitting target. If William's death was as I expect it, some sort of gang murder... I'd be in danger to say the least. That's why I tool this rather complicated way of getting in touch with you. Are you willing to make a statement to the police now? Perfectly willing... - Not that phone... - Why not? Every word you say on that line will be heard by someone on the switchboard. Phone from outside. What about the doorman, he saw me come in? Charlie's alright I fixed him. You sure you'll be alright if I leave you alone? Quite sure. But get back as quick as you can. - See Mr Smith? - Yes thanks. Oh just a minute. Wanna buy a raffle it's for a good cause... I haven't got time right now. Oh it will only take a second. I've got them here somewhere. Well make it snappy will you. Oh, I got them in the other trouser. Well I'll see you another time then. What's the trouble, who put through an emergency call? I did? What's it all about? Well I heard some funny noises in the office, this fella came out and I stopped him. What? He tried to rile me, keep my mouth shut. Now if you see me taking the brunt. Oh never. Well Mr Stevens, it's your move now inspector I can't think of a thing. I think we'll take a look at the office. Look I came down here to see a guy name James Smith, he's in his office now. He's trying to be funny inspector there is nobody with that name. This guy is nuts, I just left him. Just a minute, come on. You too. Moving on, if he's in the office I'll dial 999. And when this geeza John said I nabs him. He's been here before the trouble. - I remember. - Thank you sir. I remember something too I was just going to phone you. Phone me why? The guy we're going to see could explain. Maybe it's just as well things worked out the way they did. Here we are sir. Mr Setago! So you were gonna phone me were you? A little late thinking that one out weren't ya? I don't get it... I was only in here two minutes ago talking to a guy named Smith. Alright McBrian, usual routine, phone the yard. Yes sir. You better wait here. I didn't even know Setago was here... it was only this guy Smith. He couldn't have left he was a cripple. I see. I was on the way to phone you and this guy stopped me. I just didn't get a chance to. You didn't. Look inspector. You come with me I can show you something. It better be good. - Well Mr Stevens. - No listen Inspector. I had a message to come and see this man Smith, I guess he wasn't a cripple or else he couldn't have left. He must have killed Setago at bright dawn. Mary and Joseph. Let's get along. Inspector just let me take you to a place called the Jiffy snack bar. Why? So I can prove my story. Jiffy's snack bar, where's that? On the other side of the block. Alright get in. Jiffy snack bar. Hey... oh... This is the man inspector, there's another fellow works here named Percy. Where's the other barman? I'm the only one that works here. Wait a minute where's Percy? He was here only 15 minutes ago. There is no one called Percy in this bar, 15 minutes ago? He's crazy. Hey wait a minute inspector. This man was in here when I came in. He must have seen him. Excuse me sir do you recall seeing this man here this morning? - Are you talking to me sir? - Yes. I'm afraid I haven't seen anybody in here this morning. I haven't seen anybody in years. Well Stevens I think we better be getting along. Come on... I don't know what I can say to convince you but I'm being frames, left, right and center. Why, why should people want to frame you. I was digging around about Larry. I was onto something too. Guess they figured out I was getting too hot they wanted me out of the way. So far you haven't shown me one thing to prove this story. You must admit it's a pretty tall one. Look inspector, will you give me one more chance? Hmmm. Drive me to the Butler hotel it will only take a few minutes. Alright Steven. Butler hotel. Here it is. When I played it, it gave me the message. This will put everything in line. That's crazy. Hey you... Yes sir? Anybody touch this record I left it here about half an hour ago. - Not that I know of sir. - Are you sure? Come on Stevens. Which way did Stevens go? Mr Stevens? I haven't seen him sir. He might be in the... Circle the block. Attention please, attention please... Announcing the arrival of Birth European Airways flight 328 from Paris. Well what's it all about. Why didn't you tell me you were in the club when that Williams was murdered? Well you were weren?t you? I was yes. Why keep it a secret? Naturally after what happened I did want to be questioned. Do you think Larry murdered Williams? I... I don't know. You don't think so do you? Which fort? This is Miss Durant is there any message for me? Thank you. If you went to the police, what could do they do to you? They'd put me inside for about 5 years. But if you told them everything you knew, he might stay out of execution. Yes but five years honey. A man's going to hang for somebody else's murder. Does five years mean more to you than the rest of his life? Maybe be there's nothing you can't do to save him but there is can you live with with yourself after he's dead? I can't do it. Alright so you can't go to the police but you can tell Gregor Stevens who he takes his orders from. Alright well let's get Stevens. He'll figure something if there's anything to work on. Will you do it? I can't afford to get mixed up in this business. You don't know what they're like. I should know I worked with them long enough. I'm grateful for you Evon but... there are other considerations. I've got a position to hold on to I'm not a young man anymore. A man's going to hang tomorrow. I know it's terrible. I wish there was some way but... believe me I'd do anything. Then what's stopping you? I'll tell you, for your own selfish self, tomorrow a man dies. Stop saying that. Does it hurt already? Imagine what he'll do to you afterwards when he's dead. If you don't come to Gregor Stevens I'll go to the police myself. And I've never meant anything more in my life. Hello? Evon? Gregor, is your father there? Yes he's here now. We'll be over in 20 minutes. Fine... Look something's happened, don't use your own car, they may be tailing you, take a cab. That was Stevens. Are you ready? Well they're on their way over. What do you think you'll do with the old man? Take him to Winslow I guess. Get him to make some kind of statement if he has anything worth listening to. Here they come now. Wait a minute hold it. Take it easy. Alright now... OK Matt thanks. This is my father, Gregor Stevens, Dave Marryn. Hi. I've explained everything to him he's going to do all he can to help. Look we're running out of time so I'd appreciate anything you could tell me. Oh you can speak freely in front of Dave, he's a friend of mine. I see. Well as far as I know they're smuggling rings in my one man. His name is Charles Harris. Harris... he runs the travel bureau. The worldwide travel agency? Yes. Did Harris kill Williams? I don't know... Was it Setago? I tell you I have no idea. Even if it was Setago, it's going to be tough trying to pin a murder wrap on him. Why? Because he's dead... Jiffy snack bar was a way to get me into Setago's office, and I'm wanted for his murder. For his murder? That's right, right now I have the police in London looking for me. Well there's only one thing to do, go to Harris's office and... and what? Try to force his hand accuse him openly. There must be some record in his office to pin him down to this racket. Well I could try. There's a number one boy here somewhere. Someone own all this control, he's the guy we gotta find. Could be Harris, what do you know about Launa Dryhurst. Very little, Evon knows her better than I do. I have an idea she's married but apart from that.. Any idea who to? No she said something... Might be worth checking anyway. Give it up to Launa and pick her up now. Could be a chance in a million, if we could find out who she's married to... You mean he could be number one boy? It could be Harris. You got the front of context of the job, and if he's married to Launa then you've got the right wife. Look out! Recognise any of them? No. I wonder how they knew we were here. Search me. We'd better get back. Did they get away? Yeah clean. Told you they'd be after me, I'm getting out. Take it easy take it easy. You'll be OK as long as you don't panic. Look. I want you to go to my brother's lawyer, tell him everything you know, how you got tied up with this, the works. His name's Winslow, here's the address. I can't go on my own. They'd sort me out before I get there. They will go with you. Sure. No I... You get to see Harris, then maybe I'll get something to work on. Whatever I say won't come to much if you don't have something tangible to back it up with. OK but you can't stay here while you're waiting for me. Suppose I take him to my place? Yeah that's the idea. Gregor could pick him up later. Matt lives on a barge up the river it's unnatural. - Where is it? - Chiswick Moore. Is that alright with you? - Doesn't have much choice. - None of us have much choice. Now look, if you run into any trouble just call winslow and get hold of Dave. - Matt, take care of him will ya? - OK. Where do you check on marriages in this town? Summerset house I think. Good now get on over there and check on Launa Dryhurst will you? I'll meet you in front of the worldwide travel agency at erm... let's see. 3' O?clock. Alright. Oh... Evon. Thanks for all you're doing for me. I'm afraid I haven't been much help so far. You've been fine. Mrs Launa Dryhurst... Is this all the information you have about the lady? I'm afraid it is. I shall have to look it up it will take a little time. How long? About hour. Yes... Yes of course. I'll send the tickets to you. You're coming back I'm sure? Why? We'll we would be lost without you. Quite you are. Goodbye. Have you taken a nature cure Mr Harris? Well. A perfect set up. I wonder how many men who worked for you suddenly found themselves working setago. Until they got in the way of course, like Williams and my brother Larry. I... I don't understand. No? First you're gonna tell me who killed Williams. You don't talk you really are gonna be paralysed. Going somewhere? Mr Harris. Mr Harris? What's his name Harris? Give me that name one word! Thought you might need a little help. Got the key in his pocket. Get him out the back way. Quickly as you can. Put it in my car. Wait for me there? Is that the police. Yes. Will you send somebody to... Sorry it's a mistake. What's the trouble. Nothing it's alright. Keep this to yourself understand? Not a word. - Yes sir. - Not a word. Are you alright? Yes. Dave Leary. Brother what a sucker I've been. And I had to put you onto him. Got a light? Sure. What did you find out about Launa? I've gotta go back to Summerset house. They have to check the records. OK. We'll pick up your father first and take him over to Winslow. We should have done that before. How much longer is he going to be? There's no telling. I think it was a mistake sending me down here. It would be safer if I was with people. I'm people aren't I? I mean crowds. That's it I should have stayed in town. It's too lonely. - If they know where am... - Don't worry I will look after you. Have you got any matches? No I haven't. I'll see if I can get some I'll only be a minutes. That looked like Launa. Hi, Stevens... Let's get to the boat. They been after Mr Duran. Mr Duran? Duran? Oh great, must have taken off when you were chasing those guys. He was pretty scared. I should have stayed with him. Well you would have done a lot of things different if you'd known about Dave Leary. Look, Evon, there's still a good chance your father may try to call Winslow, I'm going over there to check... you can drop me off on your way to summerset house. And Matt, take a look around for me and if you see him tell him to call Winslow. I'll do that. Well... I didn't expect to see you. You know what's happened? I know that you're wanted for murder. Police been onto you? - They have. - Where's your Secretary. She's out at the moment, she had to go to the city. How long will she be? About an hour. - And what's that got to do with it? - Sit down I've got a lot to tell you. Now I'll give you all the facts in a work bag. It all starts out with the name of a man named John Durrant. How far is it to Bedford Square? You're a long way from there sir. How long do you think by cab? About half an hour. Why thanks. But if Duran is important enough for those men to kill why ever did you let him out of your sight? Because he told me I had to see Harris, he didn't think he'd ever be enough. So you went to see Harris and you gave him precisely nothing. Well I'm telling you I found Harris, I found the man who murdered Setago. But who's going to believe that? Stevens for a man of you intelligence I'm surprised you can be take in so easily. I'm not the only one, I've been kicked around and double crossed for 3 days and that Dryhurst name has had you buffaloed for two years. That I find very hard to believe. Look I don't care what you believe. Hello? Hold the line. Duran. Hello Durrant? I'm in Olympia. BIF. What are you doing down there? I'm here because it's the one place they won't look for me. I feel safe for the first time since I arrived in London. Wait a minute, he's in Olympia, we'd better get down there. Let me talk to him. Durrant? This is Mr Winslow speaking. Go to the sailing boat section and wait. We'll come and get you. How long will you be. About half an hour. Wait there until we arrive. Right. Try and make it sooner. In case of actions I'll get inspector Sadie to send a couple of men along. Sloane Police. Inspector Haley please. Haley, this is Winslow. I think I've got something new on the Larry Stevens case but I'll need your help. There's a man named John Durrant waiting at the sailing boat section at the British industries fair. I want you to send somebody along to take care of him. OK. I'll know what to do. OK boys this is it. Have you that information for me please? What was the name? Dryhurst, Launa Dryhurst. Oh yes, here it is. Thank you. Well Stevens this looks like our last chance. I guess if it doesn't work out you'll be offending me next. That would be a pleasure. What's the score. Stevens. Here? No at the boats. We'll get beat on him from the balcony. You rout him out if we lose him. You must be crazy, we'll never get away with it. In this crowd? Use your loaf. They've identified that driver in the crash sir. Who is it? A man named Harris. - Is he dead? - Yes sir. And there's a young lady outside that wants to speak to you urgent. - About the crash? - She witnessed it. - Show her in. - Yes. This way miss. Miss? Duran. Now sit down Miss Duran. What can I do for you. Six feet two, light suit, American cut. Looks like Stevens description. Take Miss Durrant to my car and wait for me there. Very good sir. - Yes sir? - Anything new from Olympia? Nothing else in the office besides Stevens sir. Alright inform the Olympia authorities. I want this message broadcast with our loud speakers. Attention please... attention. John Duran, Stevens are in the exhibition, they are asked to report immediately to one of the policeman at any of the exits. This is a police message. I will repeat this. You told the police he was here why are they broadcasting? Using it for their own purpose I suppose. Yeah. Anyway I think it's best we split up, there's more chance in finding that... Wait a minute, I think we'd better stick together Winslow. Come on. Go on hit them off. It's a long shot but, but if your father hears the message, you'll should be safe now. When did you realise Gregor was being framed for Setago's murder? I knew it all the time. Sometimes you have to be unconventional to get the quickest results. You heard of the pipe piper? Well Stevens was the Pipe piper. And the rats came out of their holes when they heard the tune he was playing. I had to take a gamble with Stevens, it was our only chance. Well who murdered Williams and Setago? Crawson. He was working under Harris, and when Harris was killed, the king rat came out himself. And that's what I've been waiting for. Now we're gonna walk right past those cops sweetheart. If you squeal I'm gonna let you have it. You wouldn't dare. You ought to know me better than that. Not but I... This way. That looks like Durrant. Seems they have company. Let's go. - Afternoon, congratulations Stevens. - For what? I have some new evidence on the murders of Williams and Setago. I thought we heard all the evidence in court? Not quite. We didn't hear that Launa Dryhurst was a contact for the head of a smuggling ring. Did you pick her up? They arrested her at London airport 20 minutes ago. She was waiting for you. That's ridiculous. Ridiculous? She's your wife isn't she? At least that's what we learnt at Summerset house? Sweet and you can defend my brother too. Hi stranger. Hi Bill. Say hello to my brother Larry. Oh I don't know you. Hey look we sail in half an hour's time Gregor. Right. So long kid. By Gregor. Thanks for everything. Just keep your nose clean. Sure. Listen... do me a favour will you? If you see Evon, give her a message for me. Tell her erm... I guess tell her hello. OK I'll do that. - Bye now. - Bye. You're a hard man to find Mr Stevens. Romantic music.
