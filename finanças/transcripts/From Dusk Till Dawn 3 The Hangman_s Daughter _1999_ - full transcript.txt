Take it off. If a bullet speeds at my head, I want to see my name on it. Esperen. The blood of many brave men have been shed on that wall. It should give you some comfort to share in their glory. I accept that honor. The honor is mine. Any last words? Death is the end of pains. The last pain. Preparen! Apunten! Death is the end of pain. Fuego! That's a mighty nice gun you got there, sir. Is that an... I weren't gonna steal it or nothing. I just wanted to see it up close. Is this close enough? Yes, sir. Yeah, you get out of here, cabrón. He's been hanging around here the last couple of days, not drinking a thing. Brandy. No brandy, sir. Whiskey. Right. Ask the Lord for forgiveness. He will save your soul. Ask the lord for forgiveness and He will save your soul. Would you like a prayer sheet? There you go. Don't throw that on the ground there. Give him a prayer sheet. Praise God. So, you are here for the hanging? No. I've other business. Stick around. Here in Purgatorio is big entertainment. Open your heart to the kingdom of heaven. Ask God to forgive you and He will. Would you like a prayer sheet? I don't want to be here when it happens, honey. How soon till they're ready? I'll go see. Has Villa ridden through here? Pancho Villa? No, he's south of here. Why? I have something very valuable. The best place to rack him is Tierra Negra. It's about a day's ride from here, but it's rough country. Badlands. Old-timer like you might not want to go it alone. Really? Listen, señor, is better you travel with armed company. That stagecoach there is going in that direction. Señor, a lot of white folks go missing in these parts. Can I ask your name in case someone come looking? Bierce. Ambrose Bierce. And no one will come looking. Brother, can I offer you life in the resurrection? My name's John Newlie. Bierce. Ambrose Bierce. I guess we'll be traveling together. Really? Who gets the fare? Habla Inglés? He has no tongue. I am his voice. He is my eyes. You are safe with us. I'm filled with comfort. Tengo hambre. I know you... Madrid. Look at me, Madrid. Look at me! Look at the eyes that will watch you swing from that rope. My ears will hear the crack of your neck breaking. My nose will smell the shit in your pants. And my mouth will laugh as you die. Chinga tu puta madre, cabrón. Hold him. Así! Move! Esmeralda. What are you doing here? Go home! I won't tell you again! Vete! I want to see. You dare disobey me now? Even to my face? Bring her! No! No! Déjenme! She's your daughter. Your own flesh and blood. Get her out of here. Any last words? See you in hell? That one has the devil inside. Esmeralda! She's your daughter! What are you doing? You could kill her! I'd rather see her dead. Go get the horses. Is something the matter, John? No. Lord, I thought I'd left the Bibles. But here they are. Thank goodness. We can't start a Bible school in Tierra Negra without Bibles. Perhaps Mister Bierce would like one. Oh, no. No, thank you. I've already read it. You have? My singular critique of the good book is that its covers are too far apart. Excuse me? I mean, that the Bible is perhaps the greatest assemblage of lies and untruths ever gathered together. Except the Congressional Record. Are you an atheist, sir? Yes, ma'am. Thanks to your God, I'm an atheist. Then there is no hope for your soul on the final day. When Gabriel blows his horn, your ears will be deaf to the resounding tone of his glory. Oh, no on the contrary, when Gabriel blows his horn, I shall be playing the tuba. Leave well enough alone, Mary. Mister Bierce is entitled to his beliefs or lack of 'em. How generous. So why are you here, Mr. Bierce? I'm an ambassador of good will. All right. An ambassador to whom? General Francisco Villa. The revolutionary? Himself. I'm to meet him at Tierra Negra. I'm in charge of the duty of transporting something of incredible value to him. What is it? If I divulge that information to you, I would be forced to take your life. I wouldn't want that on my conscience. He's joking, honey. He's joking. Johnny! Where were you, Joaquín? I thought... we... Chato said... what did Chato say? He said that... he said... he said that... he was... the new jefe. Where is Chato? At the arroyo, with the others. Get him. All the things they say about you, I don't believe them. Believe them. But you took me away. You helped me. I thought it would keep him from shooting at me. But I was wrong. Where will we go? Where will we go? Say that again. What do you mean, we? You go that way, and I go this way. No more words. But you can't... Cállate. You can hit me if you want. Yeah. Turn around. Keep smearing it on. Don't you have any relatives you can go to? No. What about your mother? She died as I was being born. The way my father told it I stole my first breath from her last one. You can ride with me to Tierra Negra. I know someone there. He can set you up with some food and work. What kind of work? The kind of work girls do. I don't think I'm that kind of girl. Sooner or later, all girls are that kind of girl. Entiendes? Good to have you back, Jefe. Well? About two hours or so. They're headed east. Ride back to town. Find all the men you can. Tell them I'll pay a hundred pesos to whoever brings Esmeralda back to me alive. Qué? Hablas con migo? Estas hablando con migo? Huh? No, verdad? No. Sí hablas con migo? Hablas con migo? Let me go! Let me go! What's this? I don't mean you no harm or anything. I just want a second of your time. I wanna be jour apprentice. Orale. Look, gringo maricón. My saloon doors swing only one way. Out. No! Don't you know, what an apprentice is? It's a student. I want you to teach me. I wanna be a real outlaw. A legend, like you. You want I should kill him for you, jefe? Espérate, Joaquín. Espérate. Chinga la madre! Kill her. I shot that noose clean off, and I will do the same with your chorizo. You shot the rope? Take me on and let me learn. I can handle myself. So you've proven. My name's Reese. When do we start? Lesson number one. I ask the questions and you answer them. Ok? Give me your gun. Lesson number two. Never hand over your gun to nobody. Lesson number three. We don't like gringos. I know a gringo we can hit. He's an old man. He's carrying something for Pancho Villa. What? I don't know. He said it's very valuable. She's lying. I swear to God. It could be guns. It could be gold. Where is this old gringo? He's on the stage to Tierra Negra. Very good job. Very good. But if you are fucking with me you will be in a wooden box with centavos in your eyes, understand? Good for you, pendeja. Fuego! Mister Bierce, you are sick. Now this is a sign to stop your drinking. They say when a man drinks he develops certain powers. What kind of powers? Clairvoyance. Second sight. My wife is right, Mister Bierce. You ought to take better care of yourself. This is a preservative. And I'm pickling myself for your great beyond. What did he say, exactly? He was carrying something for Villa. Something worth a whole lot. If you lie you die. Understand? Vamonos. This little Biblical expedition who foots the bill? We don't have to listen to this. My father died recently, Mister Bierce. He left me a large sum of money and I decided to use it for the... Aha. So Pastor Newlie here not only gained a bride, but a checkbook in the bargain. You insinuate, that I married my wife for her money. We have scruples! Something you must have lost. Ya saben lo Que tiene pue hacer! Vamonos! The shotgun, he's blind. Ah! Honey! What the San Hill was that? Highwaymen, no doubt. Get down. We're being robbed! Killed too, most likely. Bastards. Joaquín! The driver! José! I got him! Put that down. Stop it! Put that down! Whoa! Woha! Whoa! Whoa! Put it down! Imbecile! Do you want to die? No! Uh-uh-uh. Afuera! Afuera! Move! Which one shot me? He... That's him. Pendejo! Espera! Agárralo. Jefe... Find the gold. Reese! Over there. Look what you did to my friend, gringo. It's my liquor. Give it back. Mister Bierce! That hurt, don't it? May I assist you with something? What's the matter with you? Huh? Yeah! Mire, Jefe! We could get fifty pesos for that. Real silk. My wedding dress. The gold. I said, find the gold. Andale. Hey, Jefe. Is nothing sacred? What's in the box, señora? They're Bibles... I wasn't talking to you, pinche pendjo. They are Bibles for the children of Tierra Negra. La Biblia Santa. Where's the gold? I found something, Jefe. Mira! Cabrón. You said, he had two cases of gold. No. I said, that it could've been gold. You got something very valuable for Villa. What is it? Shoot me. Go on. No. Please. Squeeze the trigger. You can do it. Tell them what it is. Let them take it. It's not worth your life. Listen to the nun, old gringo. It's not worth your life. It is my life. What? It is me. I'm going to be a soldier of Villa's in the revolution. Crazy old gringo. What army would take you? That is... Cabrón. Let me give him what he wants. Leave him alone. He's an honorable man. Vamonos. I'd like to thank you, Mister Bierce. With all your bravado, you nearly got us killed back there. Don't you lay another finger on my husband! I'm sick of the sight of him. You have no right like this. We're alive... we're alive? What are you living for? This sick offending... John! Leave him alone. Get off of him. You still have sympathy for him? Find fault in the sin, not in the sinner. He needs help. Bring on the grapeshot. When do the lessons start? The lessons are all around you. Remember that. The earth, it's opened up for you like a woman. Was it hard to kill all those men? No, it wasn't hard, was it Madrid? See, for an outlaw it's easy. An outlaw's ready to kill, no matter what. Tell me your technique. You know, how you done it. Was it sneaking up on people? Or did you do it right into their face? Madrid, how do you become famous, and like a legend? Is that what you want, to be a legend? I wanna be an outlaw. And that means famous. People know your name and they're scared of it. They tell their children to watch out at night 'cause you could come in at night and kill 'em in their cribs. Men fear you, and women, they'll scream at the sight of you. That's what I want. Yeah? Is that what you think I am? Of course that's what you are. You're a monster. You're lying to yourself if you think you're any different. John, is something wrong? Wagon's stuck. We ain't gonna make it through this sand. We'll walk awhile. It'll be fine. I know you. Why are we stopping? I don't like cemeteries. This is for the kid. Reese, you wanna be like me? This is where you learn. The secret to becoming an outlaw and legend is fear. You mean making people scared of you? The only way you know how to put fear into someone else is for you to feel that. Feel it and face it. Can you do that? Yeah, I can try. Try? I mean, yeah, I can do it. What are you doing? What's lesson number one? You ask the questions. Get up on the cross. Move. Put the noose around your neck. Johnny, I don't think this is... Do you wanna learn? Pendeja! You wanna be an outlaw, a legend. You gotta be able to stare fear in the face, smell its breath and laugh. If you cannot do that, then forget it. Johnny, please! Shut up! Better? What happens now? Are you scared? No. Johnny! How about now? Yes. Do you feel that rope getting tighter around your neck? Yes. Stop it! Hey! No. Hijo De puta. Do you think you might slip and fall? Do you feel like a horse's ass? Huh? Cause that's what you look like, the horse's ass. Pendeja! Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh at me! You see, we're all looking at you. And you don't look like a legend. You look like... like... Joaquín, what she looks like? A horse's ass! Don't fucking laugh at me. Johnny, that's enough! You can't kill her. She's a girl. She's an outlaw, and she'll die like an outlaw. You're on your way now, kid. In a little while, you'll be a legend. Esmeralda! Wait! Come on. She don't mean nothing to us, Jefe. You chase after her. We're going on to Tierra Negra. "La Tetilla Del Diablo." Now what does that mean? I believe, I can translate that for you. Welcome home, wayward pilgrims. Innkeeper! Estamos cerrados! We're closed. Mi amigo. You speak English. English, French, Latin and Nahuatl. We'd like a room for the night, sir. All night? Two pesos. Yes. Drink? Yeah. Sure. Two glasses of milk, please. Water, then. Tequila! That's my cue. I'll have two bottles of your finest. Thank you. Milk, indeed. I think, we have some fancy water in the back. The kind with the bubbles. Yeah, I know. Anything. Please. Make yourselves comfortable. We don't get busy here for a couple of hours. Thank you. Here's to... Esmeralda! Wait! Espérame. Hey! What's the matter? You didn't even know that kid. She made you angry? She had the wrong idea about me. What happen to me when I make you angry? You don't make me angry. What if I say the wrong thing? Sometimes I just looked at my father and he hit me. I'm sorry. More? No. We'd like to see our rooms, please. I am Quixsla. Come. I will show you to your room. John Newlie. John. And she is... My wife. Mrs. Mary Newlie. Hello. Madrid did this. They will have to stop. They cannot ride in the dark because the coyotes are out, and the closest pueblo is another half-day's journey. There is nowhere to stop out here. There's one place. She's still alive. I'll kill him. I'll kill him. You stupid gringa, you have no idea what you've unleashed. Bring her! I'll have a shot of your best. Yes, sir, damn lucky thing, finding this place. When I saw it out there glimmering in the dust and the dark, I thought, it was one of them, uh, what do you call when something look real, but it ain't? A mirage. Yes, sir, that's it. A mirage. But here it is this the real thing. Whew! That's good. That's real good. I think, I'll have another. Pay for the first one. Pay for the first... I'll tell you something, friend. I ain't got a dime to my name. But I do have something much better than that. It's a brush. Yeah. Technically speaking, it's a brush. But this brush is made of the finest Andalusian hardwood. Bristles hand-picked by Andalusian gypsies straight off the mane of Andalusian horses grown in the forests of Andalusia. Ha! We don't need no stinking brushes. I'll stand the peddler to a drink. Gracias, Mister. You sure you ain't interested in the brush? That's occupied. This will be your room. All right. Call me, if you need anything. Excuse me, madam. What time can we expect supper? We eat late around here. But don't worry, I'll let you know when it's time. Are you all right, dear? Yes. I'm fine. You need anything? Nope. Nothing. John! We've been married a week, Mary. And I still don't know you look like under that dress. John, I just hope that you have better reasons for marriage than that. You know I do. I love you, Mary. It's not a sin if you're married and... I'm not refusing you because I think it's a sin. It's just that... A bat. It's just a bat, trying to find some shade from the heat. Are you sure you're all right? I feel sick. I just wanna go to bed. Could you possibly get me some water? All right, Mary. I'll get you some water. I'll be back. Son of a bitch. Are you looking for something? No. I... I dropped something. Maybe it's in here. Do you like the dress? - Yeah. Do you want it? You can have it for fifty pesos. Thought there was a lot of dirt down there in Mexico. I'd make a killing selling brushes and brooms. Tierra Negra was my last hope. If I don't sell there, it's back home for me. Hm, sweet Jesus. Maybe I can take it up in trade. If you get my drift, mister. Sorry, mister. I don't know your name. Bierce. Ambrose. Ambrose Bierce the writer? Yes. Well, if that don't beat all. You know my work? Yes, sir. I do. I done read... let me see, ok, the story where that soldier's up on that bridge, set to be hanged. And he escapes, falls into the river below. And he swam and swam and swam, run to his house, and just as he's about to kiss his wife... Snap! His neck broke. It was only a dream. Just a goddamn dream. That one just killed me. Excuse me. A drink. More seltzer? No. Tequila. Keep 'em coming. My name's Newlie. John Newlie. I like your little friend. I never seen this place before. I must've ridden through here a dozen times. Maybe we should go on to Tierra Negra. It's dark. The coyotes are out. We'll be safer in here. You are very pretty, señorita. Go inside. I'll take your horses. Yeah. You better do that. Go on. I'm gonna make sure the horses are taken care of. We don't wanna get stuck here. I'll be right back. Are you alone? Who hurt you? The scars on your back. Your husband? No. My father. You sweet child. These tears... have never fallen on a mother's breast. You're very special, Esmeralda. How do you know my name? Hey, idiot! Where are you? Hey, what are you doing? Nothing, señor. Get away from my horse. Sí, señor. John? Well, well. Remember me? Where's the girl? Pick one. I mean the one that just came in here. Where is she? Hey. Where's the girl? I'm talking to you, pinche borracho. Dónde Esta? Ya no puede caminar. Porque Le falta, porque Le falta. What's your policy on fighting here? I don't care. What do you have in mind? I'm talking a real live whipping. Broken arms, smashed nose, shattered jaw. That's what I think. I've seen worse, señor. Botella Tequila. Sí, como no, señor. What do I owe you? Shattered jaw right here. No, please, señor! Esmeralda, we're leaving. I want to stay. This is no time to fuck around. Understand? She said, she's staying. I'm not talking to you, pinche pendeja. No, but, John... Make way or I'll blow you an extra hole. Go ahead. John! Let him go... or I'll fix your little bitch! Cabrón! You're next, asshole! John! Qué Rico. John, stop it! Something wrong? What's the matter here? Your friend ate my horse. I had to shoot him. You mean Nano. You know, what you look like, Madrid? You look like an old horse's ass. Esmeralda! John! I'm walking out of here and I'm taking Esmeralda with me. You've taken her far enough, Madrid. You don't know what you're getting into. Give her back to me and I'll let you live. She's not going. You stay with me. Mauricio. It's been a long time. But I knew you'd come back. Orale... Stay away from me. The girl is beautiful. She doesn't really look like you. I said, stay away from me. But she looks a lot like me. Hey! Hey, Mauricio! After all these years! Where have you been, mi amigo? You're just in time for dinner. No! Fuck! Oh, goodness! John! Mauricio, that wasn't very nice. Machete. Agárralo. Come. Let's get out of here. What's happening? Let's go, honey. Let's go! John! Mary! Mary. Get her off! Get her off! John, help me! John! Mary! Care to dance? Mary! Mary! No! Mary, no! Mary, no! Through here! Move back! Move back! Shut the door! Shut the door! It's because of you those things took my wife! They should have taken you, pendejo! That's enough! No, it isn't! I said, that's enough. This isn't your business, gringo! I put my daughter onto this earth. Everyone here has a score to settle. And if we were anywhere else I wouldn't give two anal expulsions if you blew your stinking brains into a flatulated wind. But for now, all bets are off. Am I clear? Am I clear? It's her they want. As long as we have her, we have a chance. You want bargain my daughter? Did I say that? We have to find another way out. You better watch your back, hangman. Watch your. Madrid! Get her up! Wait! They're gone. Que pasa, Esmeralda? There's something in my hair. Where's my girl? We must find her. You have to taste what I have tasted. She has arrived! Wake the old one. John. John. Lord in heaven. John, how could you leave me up there? I'm your wife, John. They hurt me. Mary. This is not your wife, Newlie. Shut your mouth, Bierce. Oh, he's no servant of God. He talks a good game. But deep down he's a sinner. Child of Sodom! - Stop it. Send her to the hell she so fervently feared when in sermon. Now what kind of preacher would defy his God so blasphemously? The jig is up, you cocksucker. All this time you've been selling yourself as a righteous believer. And all you are is a sniveling thief. You come to me at the park, all you really wanted to do was, to take my father's money. Blasphemer! Fucking pendjo. You always wanted to see what was under this dress, didn't you? Help me! Help me! John, how could you? Forgive me. Where's the girl? She is the Princess! Was anyone else bitten back there? I wasn't. No, no me. Not I. Puta madre! No. Everybody's fine? All right, then. We're all safe. Let's move on. May God forgive and help all of us. The air feels colder. Night air. This must be the way out. It could be this way, too, idiot. We will separate and take our chances. You will take the girl, your friend, and the believer. I'll take the hangman and the kid. And try not to kill each other. Don't think, I've forgotten you, Reese. Reese. Katherine Reese. You're wanted for murder in two states, I believe. So you read papers. I'm a journalist by trade. She sent her entire family to the great beyond. Killed them in cold blood in Oklahoma. Then went on to Texas, where she proffered the same gift to her aunt, her uncle, and five cousins. Six. Six? Pardon me. You killed your mother and father? Why? They were starving. There was no food. I sent them to a better place. What about your aunt and uncle and all your cousins? I never liked them. What the fuck are you looking at, pendejo? Trouble. Hey. Where's your friend? Joaquín! Quit fucking around, Joaquín. Joaquín! Joaquín! You made me one of them! You turned me into one of those things! What? What are you gonna do? Do it before I turn. - May God have mercy on your soul, compadre. What's going on? Where are the others? Dead. Dead? And why not you? Maybe you're one of them a bloodsucker. You'd know about bloodsucking, wouldn't you? What's that supposed to mean? Give us the girl. Give us our Princess. Papi... why do they want me? Who am I? Why don't you tell her? What are you talking about? Tell her who her mother is. Tell her! We've been going in circles! If you cannot succeed in killing one another, the very least you could do is open the goddamn door! Come. There is somebody that I want you to meet. This is your grandmother. Welcome home, Santánico. No! Prepare the sacrifices for the anointing. It's really quite an extraordinarily compromising position. What are they fixing to do with us? Bleed us dry. Hangman, your past has come back to haunt us. I tried to do the best I could. I raised her in my own home for nineteen years. And I beat her so she would never disobey me. I never thought, she would come back to her mother. The old woman she predicted this. Esmeralda would return to the Tetilla Del Diablo. As long as she was kept from this place, they said, she would remain a human, just a girl. Coming here she becomes something else. You should've killed her. I tried, when she was a child. But she kept coming back. We taste of your blood that it may join us, Santánico Pandemonium. Hangman... welcome to the darkness, Santánico Pandemonium! Come here! No! Ah! Send her to her rest. I'm here, Papi. I'm home, Papi. No. I raised you, not your mother. I raised you. I know, Papi. I never wanted to punish you. I know. Papi... I love you. Out of here. Johnny, wait! Get away from me. But you brought me here. To the place I belong. I'm safe here. What are you talking about, Esmeralda? She's not Esmeralda. She's Santánico! Bitch. Johnny! Don't leave me. Come back! Johnny! Come back! Johnny! Hey. What are you gonna do now? What I came here to do. Hey. You need company? Not particularly, no. But Villa might. Subtitles: VICOMEDIA 01/2004. That's it? Yeah, that's it. That's stupid. It just ends there? Yeah. That's bullshit. Bullshit? There's no such thing as vampires, much less Mexican hooker vampires in the old west. Look, it's been nice talking to you, but I got a wife and kid at home. I understand. Thanks for the beer. My pleasure. Listen. What if I told you that I had proof? Proof.
