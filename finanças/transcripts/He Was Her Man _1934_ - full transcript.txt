It will be a cinch, Flicker. What do you say? Wait. Alright Flicker, how about it? A hundred grand cut three ways. It makes your cut better than thirty G's. I said, how about it? - No cuts. I've got to have my end now. If you want to lay it on the line I'll see you. Who do you think you are? Thirty G's on the line. I didn't say thirty. Cut it in half. Fifteen grand in advance. And no marked bills. Pretty big talk for a guy who just got out of the big house. Isn't it. Too bad to keep that stuff in a safe, Danny. You won't have to listen to it. There's lots of guys we can get to crack that box for us, Flicker. Fifteen G's and the line is out. Alright. Let's have some steam. Shower, please. Make if five grand, Flicker. Five on the line. I wouldn't knock the door off a cast-iron stove for that. I said fifteen before. Well, Now it's twenty. Forget about it. - Sure. Well. Now for a shower. Ten grand, Flicker. It is still twenty. Let's make if fifteen grand for the job, Flicker. You said fifteen. Alright. Fifteen grand it is. When do I see the money? You can bring it to room 487 at the Farnham Hotel. Right? Can do. Well, I'll tell you why I'm tipping you off. Let me reintroduce myself. This happens to be Flicker Hayes. Yes, Flicker Hayes. Out last week and not going back in. You know, Red Deering and Dan Curly hung that 3-year rap on me. Oh, yes they did. You know it and I know it. And they think I held still for the rap. But I didn't like it up there. No. And I don't think they will. I don't know. Somehow I found I couldn't get used to it. What's the layout, Hayes? Well, there's a safe full of junk and nose candy at the Empire Drug warehouse. They've hired me to use the can-opener. Yeah .. tonight. Between 11:00 and 11:30 11:00 and 11:30. Yep. Right. Is it a date? Well I don't like a stool-pigeon any more than you do. But Hayes throws this tip in our lap .. Because he thinks that Curly and Deering hung a rap on him. Yeah, they'll all turn stools for that. You'd better go up there with some men. Go over tonight. Alright. If you boys only knew how much I wanted to do this job .. You'd have got it a whole lot cheaper. We'll get it back. Shall we get going? This is awfully easy for that kind of money. Dowse that. I'm going to take this in the dark. What do you want first, Flicker? Flicker. Where are you? Flicker. Cops! Here's the layout. They must gave heard us and made their getaway. Stick 'em up! Put 'em up, Joe. Hello Dan? - Yeah? Alright, Thanks Dick. Red Deering got it. Limit? First degree. Burns on the 28th. That means you guys take care of Flicker Hayes. When do you pay off? When Hayes is where he'll never squeal on nobody. That good enough for you, Monk? Hayes is as dead a Deering will be when they pull the switch. A Pancho Villa. Thanks, Mr Hayes. Who? Aren't you Flicker Hayes? Uhuh. My name is Allen. Jerry Allen. Oh excuse me. You look like a guy who came into Kelly's back in New York. Oh really? Well .. there's a lot of strange looking people in the world. Hello. Hello. Say, can you tell me when the next boat leaves for China? I'll connect you with the steamship company. Orient Pacific Steamship Company. When does the next boat leave for China? We have a boat sailing tomorrow night at 8pm. Have you your passport, sir? Oh .. I hadn't thought of that. Well, how long will it take? Three days if I have my pictures? Forget it. Forget it. Alright, thanks anyway. Thanks. Oh, excuse me. I was .. Come on, come on. Give me the rest of it. What? The crack about the wrong room. Oh no. This is the room. Oh it is? Oh no, you've got me wrong. I was tossed out of here last night flat broke. I got away with the key because I had to come back. For one last look at the old homestead? No. I hid something when they took my clothes away from me. I can prove it to you. Go ahead. Wait a minute. Stand over there. What is it? A wedding dress. That's all I was after. Now do you believe me? That's the only place I could think of where they wouldn't look. There's a dame for you. Hocked the ring and kept the dress. Where's the old man? - I'm not married. Not yet anyway. Uhuh. I get it. When does it happen? As soon as I can get to him. I've got some hitch-hiking to do. Can I borrow this? - Yeah. Sure. Are you hitch-hiking? Yeah. I'm flat. Where you bound for? A little burgh about a hundred miles down the line. That's why I have to have this, see. I'm much obliged. How long is it since you ate? Long enough. I guess I'm all in. - Uhuh. Take your coat off. Pancho Villas. Three for a half. Going up to 419. Looks like he has company. - Well, he's got the makings anyway. Say, Bob. What's the matter with Cat's Whiskers in the fifth? What track? That horse is no mudder. Say, do you know who's dinner that was? Flicker Hayes. What makes you think so? He's in 419 registered in the name of "Allen". It's Hayes alright. He used to hang around Kelly's back East. Did you ever see that statue of the three monkeys? Hear nothing, see nothing, say nothing. You're the last monkey. I met him right here in this hotel. A guy in town for a good time. The bellhop introduced us. Figure it out for yourself. I guess I was too surprised to say yes when he asked me to marry him. So I let him go home. But it was the thing he said that stuck in my mind. Yeah? What was that? He said that no matter I'd ever done or been .. It would be a new start when the preacher said the words over us. That kind of got to me. So when things got tough I wrote him a letter and here is the answer I got. Rose. Is that your real name? - Rose Lawrence. You got it in black and white. It says "marry" alright. I didn't think anybody put that in writing anymore. What did you do with the dough he sent you? Well, I always said if I ever made it up the aisle .. I'd do it right, so I fell for the dress. Cherchez la femme. I guess so. In a hurry? Listen, you're alright, Mr Allen. "Jerry" to you. Anyway, you're really alright. The way you helped me. I've got to be going. Not right away. What's the matter? It just wouldn't mean anything, I guess. You sure? No, I'm not. You've kind of got under my skin, treating me so good. But I wouldn't let it mean anything, see. I had to make up my mind about that guy. Now that I've done it I don't want to cross myself up. I've always just sort of drifted along. Now I've started something I want to finish. Where is the burgh you said you were going to? Santa Avila. It's south of here. Down the coast. Nick. "Nick Gardella". That's his name. He's a fisherman. What's the matter with that? Santa Avila is where they have the boats. What else do you know about the joint? - Only what Nick's told me. It's a quiet little place he said. Dead to the world. There's not even a highway. But I don't care. I'd like to drop out of sight. Look. I've got a better idea. I've been planning on going down south myself. Forget all about that hitch-hiking. We'll get yourself out of hock and .. I'll blow you to a bus ride. Pop Simms calling from San Francisco. Hello Pop. I said it's Flicker Hayes. I saw him leave here last night with a dame. No. He didn't see me. He wouldn't have known me if he had. Yeah. I little dump called Santa Avila. He bought two tickets. Of course. It's a hideout. Right .. I got you. Let him think he's hid out, huh? Yeah. He and the dame left by bus. Coffee? - Coffee. What will you have? - Nothing, thanks. Cup of coffee? Alright. - Two coffees. They don't even bury them out here. That's nice work, boy. I hope I didn't take a wrong bus after Nick telling me so careful. Funny he isn't here to meet me, us getting married and all. Is that why you didn't want me to get off here? What do I care what you do? - Yes, I know. I was thinking about him. Maybe he changed his mind. He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't. I've got it here in writing. Uhuh. Yeah. That's right. He's hooked. - Mind your own business. Hi Dutch! Come on in. Hi boy. Did she get here alright, Dutch? Sure she did. I just got her from the Post Office. Wait until you see it. Oh boy. That's what she is. A genuine old boy camper's cut. She'd have cost me plenty up in Monterey. $17.50 at least. Sending away I got it for $9.75. With a Hercules lapel adjuster included. Ah, she's a beaut. When you going to put her on, Dutch? Well, the first chance I got is Nick Gardella's wedding next Sunday. Oh boy. You people going over to Santa Avila? I am. I thought you might be passengers for the beach. Are there many? One guy last month, going fishing. He gave me a buck for the ride. Oh yeah? Look. Here's a buck for the lady. And .. one for me. I want to do some fishing myself. - Thanks. I guess we can all get in the front seat. Do you know where Nick Gardella lives? - Sure. Everyone knows where Nick lives. In the little house right past the wharf. Him and his mother, Mrs Gardella. Well, let's get going. Hello. Nick Gardella live here? Si. What you want with my Nick, please? I'd like to get a look at him if he's around here. What you say? Nick is on the boat, fishing, - You see. The man is fishing. How could he meet the bus? Are you Mrs Gardella, Nick's mother? Si. Yes, yes. Meet the bride. It is Rosa. Oh, my Nick's Rosa! Sure, it's me alright. The wife-to-be of my Nick. Come in, come in. Come in. Nick will be here. He comes soon after the fishing for his supper. When he sees you he will be happy. You are the brother? The brother of my Nick's Rosa? No, he's just a friend of mine, Mrs Gardella. Mr Allen. He brought me here. That's all. He can't stay. No, no. He is a friend. Then we have together, wine? Sure. Bring on that vino, mother. I'm a sucker for the good red ink. - Yes. Nick will be here. Wait a minute. Please sit you down. I will get the wine. How long you going to stick around for? - Who knows? The old lady may ask me to stay to supper. It smells wonderful. How is it going to look to Nick? A man bringing me here. I don't think he'd start asking questions at this late date. Do you? Here I come. Here I come. There you are. Vino de Porto. The wine of my country. In the world, there is none better. I'll do the honors. Wine .. he is good? Vino de Porto is better than good. Si. Oh .. Rosa .. Make right away yourself at home. That is what Nick said. All day long I wait for you. While Nick goes on the boat. So, as soon as Nick is here we eat supper. It is good for all girls to eat. Please to stay, yes? Mother .. after getting one whiff of your cooking, you couldn't put me out. Well, there you are. For you? Here is to the bride. - No, no, no. We must have Nick for that. - Alright then, mother. To you. You were a bride once yourself you know. - What you say? I'll bet you were an eyeful too. Rosa, you must be careful of him. He has a bad eye. Oh, he means you just must have looked swell in your wedding dress. Quick. I show you the picture. Me and my Manuel. You've got to get out of here before he comes. Do you hear me? Before supper? I didn't ask you to go on an empty stomach. You've no right to be here like this. - Like what? Like you and I knew each other before in Frisco. Well, if I remember rightly, that's where we met. Well, what?s Nick going to think? Paying my bus fare and all. He needn't know. Besides, you'd not be here if I hadn't. - Why not let me alone and get out? Hello Nick. Well, I'm here. I'm sure glad to see you, Rose. You sure got here alright, huh. Meet my friend. A friend of mine: Mr Allen. Pleased to meet you. That goes both ways. He's going on down the coast. He kinda looked after me on the way. Is that so? You sure is a good friend alright, huh. Don't you want to kiss me, Nick? I'd .. like to alright. I won't look. Go ahead, Nick. Go ahead. Let him look. We don't care. Sure. What's so funny about that? - Mister, for me fishing is work. I think it's funny for a fellow to fish when he don't have to. I'd get a kick from it if you took me too. I'll take you alright. Maybe I'll put you to work. What time you think we get up in the morning, huh? Four o'clock in the dark we shove off. So, the middle of the night? - Sure, for you. Not for fishermen. Four o'clock every morning? Maybe pretty soon Nick is going to get lazy, huh? I'll lay you 8-5 he throws the alarm clock away. Is that meant to be funny? Six times more round and then the wedding. It comes the second day after the Fiesta San Rocco. That's Sunday. - Sure. Before the wedding, big Fiesta San Rocco. Oh I am glad if you stay. He can't stay. He's got to go down the coast on business. If he stay one day for going fishing he can stay two more for wedding? No? Why not? - A good friend, mister. You bet. Eh Rose? - Yeah. I want to see more of this place anyway. You've made me like it here. Then everybody stay back pretty soon maybe. Plenty work tomorrow. I'm kind of tired at that. - Sure. You like to make goodnight, Rosa? I guess I guess I use some sleep alright. I take you where you sleep, then. I don't see you in the morning Rose, I guess. No? Why not? Only the men get up so early for the boat. - Oh. Well I'll see you tomorrow night then, I suppose. Sure. Well. You're supposed to kiss her now, Nick. A person has as much privacy as a goldfish with you around. Now there is a dame for you. Get sore because you try to say the nice thing. Now just for that, don't kiss him. Come on, Nick. You show me to my room. Sure, Nick. It is better you take the lamp for Rosa. Always, since I am a little boy, this is my room. And as for you, Rose. You like it alright? Sure Nick. I think it's swell. I .. I don't know how to say very good. It makes me glad for you to marry me, Rose. You say it fine. I kinda like the way you talk at that. You glad we get married? Sure, Nick. Awful glad. Say Nick. - Yes, Rose? You're not kidding yourself are you? I mean about us getting married. You know how things were with me before we met. What is before with you makes no difference. We get married. A new life starts for us both. Okay. Just forget it. I'm liable to say anything. You .. don't want to get married? I told you I was glad, didn't I? Well I am, see. I'll be a good wife to you, Nick. You know I will. Don't you? I'm glad to hear you say like that now, Rose. In Frisco when I ask you to marry. I'm afraid because you laugh at me. I say it makes new start for you. Well I'm not laughing now, am I. You're not afraid. Are you? Afraid? You make me. I do not know how to say. Not afraid for anything. You're alright, Nick. We'd better say goodnight. Sure, Rose. Goodnight. Goodnight. How about a little nightcap, mother? Si. Where do I park the body? What you say? Where do I hit the feathers? You know, sleep? Oh .. you and Nick sleep in the bunkhouse. You are a fisherman now. Salute. - Salute. You won't need none of this stuff. I won't, eh? - No. They got regular deep-sea tackle on all the boats. Is that so? - Yes. What's the best boat to go out on? Well, there ain't much choice. This first one coming, the Cristobal, is a good old tub. It belongs to Nick Gardella. He took a fellah out with him this morning. Is that so? - Yeah. What does he charge for a day's fishing? Well, they'll take whatever you give 'em. This guy will probably slip him five bucks. Yeah? A friend of his, huh? Some fellow from Frisco, I guess. I brought him and the lady over in the truck last night. Is that so? - Yeah. No railroads come in here, huh? - No. Nothing comes in here. Uhuh. I'm beginning to like this place. - Yes. Hey. Get the bow line. Me on the bow line? - Sure. I'll throw it right in the drink. - Ha-ha. Amigo .. take stern line. Here you are. Here is to you. Ah, I'll make a sailor of you yet. I like all you fellows to come to my house for supper. Please bring your wives. I like everybody to see my Rosa. They tell me you're some picker, Nick. - Who tell you that? Your pal here. - You bet. First you get everything unloaded. I tell the old lady get supper. Oh say. - Yes? How would you like to have a passenger tomorrow? Maybe I'd like to do some fishing myself. Sure, come along. I think it's lucky if I take fellows fishing who don't know it. Every fish in the Pacific know Nick Gardella. They don't know him. He never fished before. He catch the biggest one today. No. Is that so? Never fished before? - Only got here last night. Well, where are you stopping, friend? Is there a hotel in town? A hotel in this town? Why, he stay at my house like a fisherman. Well, I'd like to find some place to sleep. I've come quite a distance today. You from Frisco? No, I regret to say I'm not, friend. No. I've got a little ranch back there in the country. I'd like to try fishing for a change. You're in the right place, mister. - "Parker" is the name, Mr Gardella. Jim Parker. Allen. - Pleased to meet you, sir. Well, how about it, Mr Gardella? Think you can put me up for the night? If you like to stay in bunkhouse with us two I guess so. Well, that would suit me fine. If you just let me know where to go. See, I've left my bags up the store. I'll go and get them. Come along. I show you. Alright, let's make one last round. I don't understand why you go. - We're going to make money. That's why we got boat, huh? - You go on the boat tonight? Sure. We got to. I don't get it. You mean you fish at night? Ice boats stay out at McGill bight tomorrow. Take on all we catch. 2 or 3 tons, maybe. We got to go tonight to get to McGill's bight tomorrow morning. What's the matter, Rose? You don't like it if I go out at night? It is money. - For sure, Nick. You go ahead. It's your business. I'll go along with the boys and warm up the engine. How about us? Are we going? - Uhuh. I'm staying here. Goodnight. When you coming back? - Tomorrow. Fiesta de San Rocco starts tomorrow night. And nothing but good time and Fiesta until .. Until wedding, huh? - Sunday. Yeah. Sunday alright. You see plenty of fish tomorrow, Jerry, alright. You can count me out, Nick. I've had my fishing for the week. I can't say the same but I'll ask to wait until daylight, Nick. It's the bunkhouse for me tonight. It's a good thing I've got a crew now. These fellows are afraid of the dark. Nick. I'll walk a ways with you. - Sure. You watch 'em, ma. And don't drink up all the wine before Sunday. Well. Rose, I .. will see you tomorrow. Why can't you take me with you, Nick? - On board? - Yes. That is not a place for a woman. But I want to go along. Well everybody will say Nick is crazy if I take you onboard. Alright, Nick. Whatever you say. Sure, Rose. Oh, Jerry. Please, take this upstairs for me and make warm in Rosa's room. Alright, darling. Goodnight, Jerry. - Goodnight. Oh, sweetheart .. how about an extra blanket for your baby? It's awful cold out in the bunkhouse. Oh sure. Sure. Goodnight. Here it is. This is going to make you warm. One for Jerry too. - Thanks. Well madam .. until tomorrow. Si, si. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Well Miss, we'll soon have the pleasure of calling you "Mrs". Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well ma, I guess it's all in a lifetime. I don't know English like you, Rosa. But I think very much all the time I wish you be happy with my Nick. Say, what is this? I'm trying to light this rat-trap for you. Seems like you're always doing something for me I don't want. Light it yourself. Who asked you to? The old lady. I suppose she asked you to see I didn't get lonesome too? No, I don't think that occurred to her. - She thinks you're in the bunkhouse. Now you get out of here. Whatever made you think I was going to do anything else? Why don't you please leave me alone. - I was only talking to you. Well, I don't want you talking to me, see. You get out of here. This is my house. You've got no business here. This is my house. You get out of it. I wish I'd never seen you. Never even seen you. You and me have got nothing to do with each other, see. Nothing to do with each other, ever. Lots of work today. Everybody make ready for Fiesta for San Rocco. You never can see how Portuguese can eat and drink. Well you'll have a house full, ma'am. Our Fiesta is not in the house, it is in plaza. Drink. Dance like crazy. Have a good time. Good morning. - Morning, Rosa. Como est?? - Pretty good, I guess. Sit there, Rosa. Morning. And to you, Miss. So soon as we eat, we all go to plaza and help make ready for Fiesta. Everybody there tonight. When is Nick? When are the boats coming in? Before night alright. I'm getting out of here just as soon as Nick gets back and I can tell him so. You wanted to get married? I started out to but I didn't know I was going to double-cross myself on the way. I can't cross Nick up too. I've got to tell him I've changed my mind. Then what? - I'm on my way. Where to? You're broke. - I'm used to it. That's not getting any groceries. I'll worry about that. Your quite a girl Rose, talking that way. No I'm not. I've always been on my own. I can take care of myself. I brought you down here. And it looks like I'm going to take you away with me. I haven't asked you to. - What would you say if I did? Say that again. What if you and I ..? If I was to take you away with me? Oh, I guess you don't mean that. I'm asking you what would you say? Don't you know? Yeah, I guess I do. Come on, let's get out of here. There's only one thing I want to tell you, Jerry. When I made up my mind to get married I meant to play on the level with Nick. To be the best wife I could to him to kinda pay for his giving me a home. But ever since I walked into that room in Frisco there's been nobody but you. You believe that, don't you? That's good enough for me. Then I'll go any place on earth with you. For as long as ever you want me to. I'll be the first one to tell you when I don't. Don't, Jerry. Never again in this house. How far is this Santa Avila? Oh, about 90 miles down the line. After that plane ride, you'll never feel it. Here's the car. Alright, let's go. Hello mister. - Hi. It would have been much easier telling him this morning. All these people having such a swell time makes it tougher some way. If I'd known the boats would get in late I'd .. - Both are in now. That bunch is off a boat. Look at 'em. Lit up like a torch. If I could only talk to Nick alone he wouldn't take it so bad. It wouldn't seem like I was running out on him cold. He's got you worried, huh? Nick asked me to marry him, see. I don't want him hating me. You haven't got much time. Well maybe if I go down to the wharf I can see him right away. You get Dutchy to take you to the bus and then send it back for me. When it's all over I'll meet you there. You think I'd better go with you? No, I'm going to do this myself, Jerry. Alright. Mr Allen, you know where Mr Parker is? - Yeah, he's around here some place. Say, where is your truck? - Up at the store. Tell you what. Go to the Gardella house, get my grip and come back to pick me up. But I got a message for Mr Parker. Well tell me and I'll give it to him. Well you tell him to go up to the store and call the telephone operator. She's been trying to get him. Alright, go ahead. Hurry. I'll do that. Pop, you'd better get to a phone. The operator has been trying to get you. Long distance? - I don't know. Well thanks, friend. I hope everything is alright up at the ranch. - I hope so. Oh, Dutch. Got your car? - Sure. I want you to take me down to the bus. What bus was you going to take? The northbound or the southbound? What do you care? I don't but the southbound bus already went through. You're crazy. It's not 9 yet. I ain't crazy. They changed the schedule this week. The southbound bus leaves at 7:30. When's the next one? - 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Did you get my grips? - Sure. Why not take them to the Gardella house? Where will you be in the morning? At the store. I sleep there. I'll get in touch with you. Go ahead. Heavy fog, eh? Well, that make night driving plenty dangerous. Well there is some kind of a fleabag hotel down here. We'll stay tonight, go in the morning. Yeah. That's very sensible. Yeah, I surely will. I know where he is all the time. He just told me now I was wanted on the telephone. No. Not a chance. Give me the layout there. There is a lunch room there, right by the bus station. You wait for me. I'll show you where to go. Hello, Rose. I thought it was Nick. Still scared? I wasn't scared of Nick. It was just that I couldn't figure something. I've got it straight now. And I feel like it was a load off my chest. I thought it was wrong for me to be so happy while I was hurting Nick. The more I thought of it the worse it seemed. All of a sudden I knew if nothing in the world meant anything to me but you .. That was the end. The only one that mattered. That's the way you feel about it, huh? You know I'll stick .. to the finish. The finish may be a long way off. - You never know, Jerry. What do you man, you never know? - Because nobody ever knows. That's why you've got to make the most out of your life while you can. Why my life? I mean everybody. Our life. Looks like you figure on sticking a long time. That's the kind of a gal I am. Listen. I don't know if you've got a dime. Or what you do. Things like that don't matter. Not to me. Yeah, yeah. I know. Now listen, you go on up to your room. I'll stall Nick when he comes. You don't look good. You won't have to see him now. Go. Is Dutch set up to take us to the bus tomorrow? Yep. All fixed up. - When's it go through? Dutch knows. Will be plenty of time. Go on. Go to your room before the old lady comes in. She'll be here soon. Come on. From tomorrow on, it's just you and me. Anywhere. Goodnight, Jerry. Goodnight, kid. Now go on, get some sleep. Go ahead. Hello Nick. - Hello. Where you been, China? - Ha. Mad as a fool to be a fisherman, Jerry. Work, work, work all the time. Where is Rose? - Everybody has hit the hay. The Fiesta wound up about a half hour ago. Sure. Fiesta is all over while I'm on boat. Fisherman is a bad life, Jerry. Everybody has good times. But Nick, he's got to work all night. Here you are, take this. Will make you feel better. Thanks. I'll feel better tomorrow too. We have good time at wedding alright. No work for three or four days. You will stay for a week maybe? No, Nick. I'm thinking of heading south. Right away after the wedding? I was planning on going down there you know, before I stopped off here. You've got business for hurry up down south? Yeah. Kind of. I'd like to buy up some kind of business for fisherman. What kind of business you got? You tell me. Maybe I can learn. Oh, I'm not going south on business, Nick. So, why you got to go right away then? Because I got mixed up with a woman. You have trouble with a woman? Hmm. Pretty near. I was headed for it until I got wise to myself. Yeah, I almost let myself fall for a dame. Something I never did in my life. And never will. A woman makes trouble for you, huh? No dame is going to get that chance. I'm not going to make a chump of myself. - I don't get everything you say, Jerry. Are you going south because you have trouble with woman up in Frisco maybe? Frisco or any other place. A woman means trouble sooner or later. And I've had some. A woman has got herself crazy for you and you don't want her, huh? That's just about it. Well, if you have not love for a woman, one thing is best. Go away from her. That's the truth if ever you spoke it. - Uhuh. What time you get up tomorrow? Not so early as every day. The wedding is at 11 o'clock. Tomorrow is a big day for me, Jerry. Yeah. It may be a big day in your life at that, Nick. I'd like it if you'd change your mind about going before the wedding, Jerry. No Nick. I think I'll be on my way first thing in the morning. Alright. We'll talk about it when we get up. Yep. The bunkhouse sits back from the road about sixty feet. You can walk right in. He'll go with you alright. I've got his rod. What about the Porgy? No trouble there. I frisked him too while he was asleep. All he's got is a double barrelled shotgun. That's at the bottom of Santa Avila creek. Well. Here it is, Simms. You'd better count it. Na, it's alright. Here comes that northbound bus, boys. He was asleep when I left. Yellow as they come. Hey, you. Dig in for two bits. This thing is a gyp box. Maybe you handled it too hard. Oh yeah? Maybe I didn't handle it hard enough. Hey, you can't get away with that here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Wait fellah, you don't any trouble. He's going to pay, see. Listen, fellah, we don't go for that stuff around here. No? Well maybe you'll go for this. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on Dutch. Let's get down that bus station. Oh there is lots of time. - Oh no there isn't. I don't want to miss it this morning. Go ahead. I can't imagine Hayes going for any dame. Yeah. He always played lone wolf. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - It's me, Rose. Everybody goes now to the mission to get ready for the church. Just a minute, Nick. I want to talk to you. Nick, I have something .. I am very sorry I am not here last night for the Fiesta. I think you are mad with me for not being with you. No. It doesn't matter. Where is Jerry? I think he goes early with everybody to finish getting ready the church. Look Nick, I've got to tell you something. I couldn't tell you. - No Rose, please listen. I know I should not be on the boat when everybody here for good time for Fiesta. But I do it only to make money for you. - Yes, I know. You see I think all the time to have some things only the best for you. I'm happy for you to marry me. So I got to work like crazy to have everything someday to make you happy. Because I cannot say like I feel. Only can I make tell you what is in my heart for you always. Look, Nick. I'm not .. - You mad with me anymore? Good. After today .. Tudo deve ser bom para voc? sempre. That is in my language what the husband would say to the wife before marriage. It means: All things must be good for you. Always. Nick. Alright. You go ahead. With the others. You'd like to dress up right away? That's why you make me go away, yeah? I go to the church, I see the priest. I get everything ready and I come back. You never see such nice things for a wedding before, Rose. You turn your car round and wait for us here. [ Door knocks ] Good morning, Miss. Does Nick Gardella live here? - Yes he does. Do you happen to know if a friend of his by the name of .. "Allen" is around? Why, he's .. What is it you wanted? We are friends of Allen, Miss. We come to see him on business. Are you acquainted with him? Yes, I am. Can you say where we could find him? Why, he's .. I expect him back any minute. - Mind if we wait? No. Was you going someplace, Miss? - Well, I was. I don't understand. What do you want? - I told you. We was friends of Allen. We come to see him. Oh, excuse me. Want to sit down? Let's wait in the car. You say you expect him back? - Uhuh. Well then, we won't bother you. We'll wait outside. Now .. now listen, Dutch. I don't want you to go back to town until the bus passes through. Why not? Here is why not. - If you says so. Alright. That's his dame alright. The one Simms told us about. And she's covering. She don't know who we are. She's too dumb. No? Well he's blew town and she's about to follow. Better make that dame talk. She don't know who we are. She don't know who he is. If we talk now, it's tipping our mitt. It's like going right up to Quentin and banging on the door. We'll make her talk and then give the heat to both of them. But what if she won't spill it? She'll still be wise. She can lose her memory the same way, can't she? Let's go. Start your motor Whitey, and keep it running. Wait a minute. Don't let's go too fast. If she's not wise she's telling the truth, and the guy will walk in. We'll stall her first. Alright, but if he don't show, she talks. - Okay. What time is the next bus through here? - Oh, in about .. Say, you're the guy who was driving that car. Where is that gorilla that slugged me? I'm going to get him and get him right. What do you mean, slugged you? - You drove the car. Who was those guys? I've nothing to do with 'em. When's the next bus out? Well, you was with 'em. - I never seen 'em before. He was driving the car. Two of them were talking to an old guy in fishing gear. The big one smashed my machine and slugged me. Well I didn't see it. I don't know anything about it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Stay where you are. Open up kid and talk fast. Who are they? Who are you? Are you a dick? I said talk fast. Listen. I didn't know. I got to get out of here. They're a couple of Red's. Let me alone. I ain't done nothing. Where are they now? I'm in the clear. My boss knew it but I didn't. You can't hang nothing on me. I just drove them down here but I didn't know. Keep talking. They are guns. They come down here to get a guy. I didn't know. Now they are going to get rid of the dame. I got to get out of here. Say that again. In San Avila. Some house down there. We drove up and I got away. They are going to give it to some dame. Oh yeah? He ought to be here any minute now. She's stalling us out of her eye teeth. Come on, let?s give her the works. She'll spill. Then you got to go through with it? Use your head. Wait and see what she does. Is that what they said they'd do? - So help me. I got to get out of here. Here comes a bus. Let me go, will you. If they find me here, they'll .. - Where were they when you left? In the house. You got to let me take that bus. I'm in the clear, I tell you. Yeah, sure. You are in the clear. Go ahead. All aboard. I hope we ain't keeping you, Miss. That's alright. I guess you're right, Monk. - Sure I am. He made a clean getaway. Now the only thing left is that dame. Take her along and after she spills, we'll .. Hey, that motor ain't running. Where is that guy? Get in that house with that dame and keep your mouth shut until I come back. I'm going to find out. Say, Dutch. Do you know where I can get hold of a gun? I got a good shotgun, double-barrelled. There's lots of wild ducks around here too. Oh yeah? Well where is it? I'd like to borrow it. I loaned it to a guy. He took it hunting down San Remo way. That's going to be a big help to me, in San Remo. You going to need me any more today? I'm going to change my clothes for the wedding. Well I won't need you, Dutch. You can go on. Turn around, Hayes. Hello J.C. What's that for? A guy by the name of Red Deering burned yesterday. Oh yeah? - Uhuh. Who is up here with you? - Monk Savlin. He's in there talking to your dame. After a while, we're all going for a ride in the car. We think she might do too much talking. You ought not to worry about her, J.C. She doesn't know a thing. Yeah? How do we know she isn't wise to the whole set up? How much does she know, Hayes? We didn't ask her. Nothing. I picked her up in Frisco. She doesn't know a thing about me. If you let me do the talking I'll prove it to you. Your move. Jerry, these guys .. - Rose, meet a friend of mine. We already met. They're waiting for you. How are you, Jerry? - Never better, kid. Can I do the talking? - Go ahead. Rose, I've got something to tell you. I think we'd better go inside. Alright. Sit down, Rose. Can I get you boys a drink? These people make nice vino up here. No thanks. - No? You do the talking. - Alright. Rose, I told you I had something to say to you. This is the way it is. I used to be in business with these boys. And they came down here to get me to go back with them. Now J.C. has made it sound very good. Only thing is must leave right away. Now, he thought you might not like the idea, so .. What do you think I must do about it? You're the boss, Jerry. Well .. you see, I can't take you with me. You can't take me with you? Well, not right away. I understand, Jerry. I understand everything. What do you mean? Do you care if they hear? It don't make any difference to me. No, go ahead. Will you answer me one question? - Sure. You don't want to take me with you anywhere. Do you? Answer me straight, Jerry. Well, if you want it straight. And you want to talk in front of people. That's it. I had a hunch last night. I knew I was due for this but I wouldn't let myself believe it. You're not the kind of a guy that wants a dame hanging on to him. You tried to talk yourself into it .. but you didn't want it. You're just trying to let me down easy. You don't have to. You go ahead. On a stack of bibles, all I wish you is the best. I hope you get the breaks right down the line. Always. You've got to believe that. You've got to know that I am for you all the way. You go ahead, Jerry. So long, Rose. Well, what did I tell you? I told Monk she didn't know. How about the kid? Did you find him? - No, he scrammed. Let's go. Jerry. What's all this? There is a wedding in town. People I'm living with. Yeah? Well talk fast and talk straight, Hayes. Jerry. We looked for you at the church. Where you been? Nick, I want you to meet friends of mine. So, you please come in the house and make drink with us, mister? No thanks. We can't stay. That is too bad. Sorvete. Sorvete? I forget the ice-cream. She will melt. Jerry, will you take me in the automobile quick to the store? The ice-cream was cooked special and Dutch forgot to get it. Hurry or she will be all milk. It's alright ma'am, we'll get it. I will go with you and show you where she is stored. You know where it is don't you, Jerry? - Yeah, sure. We'll stop by and pick it up for you, mother. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Come on Jerry, let's go. The church is all ready, Jerry. You come back quick, huh? Oh Nick. Nick. Women have been known to try to back out of a wedding at the last minute. But no matter what this bride of yours says, you take her up the aisle .. If you must throw her over your back. Nothing is going to stop Nick from getting married. You see that it doesn't. Alright, J.C.? Slip in under the wheel. Rose. Rose! I would like it very much if you would put on the dress, Rose. Everything is ready. You'd better come up here, Nick. There's something I've got to tell you. I knew him up in Frisco. He was a whole lot more to me than just a friend. That's why I didn't put on that dress. I like. If you would put on the dress, Rosa. A long time ago I tell you .. What is before with you .. Is not in our life after we marry. I think you don't know how I mean it in Frisco. But now it is just the same. But I like. If you will put on the dress. Rosa. Don't touch me, Nick. Just let me look at you. I don't th?nk I've ever really seen you before. This way out. Well. It's a nice day for it. - For what? The wedding. Oh. You won't forget the ?ce-cream will you. I'm going that way.
