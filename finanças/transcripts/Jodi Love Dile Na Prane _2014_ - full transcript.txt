What to see coz there are beauties everywhere The pollen swirls and so does my mind.. ...for all that I touch is mysteriously woven The pollen swirls and so does my mind for all that I touch is mysteriously woven What the hell! Are you serious! Get out! The letters in my mind.. ...can defy the painted rain The breeze sings to me of heart break and pain The hoards of people are laid into busy trams and buses.. ...as I carry my load alone My ringtone sings of a secret pet name.. A mere façade The breeze indulges me, on this day.. where the light of my soul loses its way The pollen swirls and so does my mind ...for all that I touch is mysteriously woven Moinak Babu? Who the hell is this? It's me. Come in Come in Could you kindly pull up the window? Ya.. Ghosh Babu let's move Rana da need not have described you much With your yellow, red and orange shirts... He could have just said you were bright and handsome Thanks I'm Rahul Bose Moinak Chatterjee Nice meeting you I cannot remake a South Indian film or.. A stale story of a menopausal woman's isolation I'd rather open a roadside Paan shop Rana's Paan Palace A Paan for everyone Or something like that Rana Da! Listen, I'm a little busy right now.

I have an NRI friend who will cover it But there is just one condition.. ...this has to be a love story Love? Don't mind Rahul Babu, but.. I think you've come to the wrong director I'm not interested in making.. Stereotypical bengali films. Sorry Rana Babu, a love story where.. ...the hero and heroine run in slow motion... And hug trees is not what.. ...I am asking you to make A love story with a difference Ok. But why a love story? That's my personal choice I'm not asking you to make an intellectual film.. ...which is impossible to understand And I don't need awards. In fact it doesn't matter if this film makes no money I have no problem But this film has to prove.. ...love still exists Do you have any kind of story line? No, no, I leave that to your discretion So, boy. Do you have any knowledge of such a story? Love story with a difference… Also, it can't be a remake of an older film. It must be a story of today All I want to prove is that love still exists Yes, that's exactly what you said Do you have anything in mind? Take your time.

If you continue to drink that rubbish I won't be able to show my face in public. You're becoming just like the men of this family. Why can't you be more like your father? You are completely knocked out. Absolutely senseless. Which alley did you crawl out of last night? I had a meeting Meeting. Is that where you drink that rubbish? You have any idea how you reached home? You didn't have any shoes on you. Disgraceful. Shit! What? Oh nothing. Give me some tea. I won't give you squat until you tell me.. ...when this disgraceful behaviour will end? Ma, it's just one day. This one day scheme of yours is really testing my patience. Get to the market now Is Father pissed off? No he's waiting to worship you He's left 500 rupees for you, it's in the drawer, For God's sake buy a pair of slippers. For now please relieve me by going to the market. Hello? Are you awake my darling? Ya Did you think of anything? About what? What do you mean? How many pegs did you drink last night? Forgotten everything? How goes the love story? Not the love story again What do you mean? You do realize that the man is an absolute psycho? You are the psycho! Rahul Babu is not a producer, he is Aladdin's genie. He doesn't want awards or a hit ...and there are no budget constraints He is a dream come true. These are severe abnormalities My boy, let me decide between normal and abnormal. You just think of the plot We have a meeting with Rahul Babu at his flat in Southern Avenue in the evening. We'll meet at Golpark Today, but… No buts.. I'm hanging up now, nature calling, bye. Is he mad or what? Uncle? Hello young man. What news? Not good Why? Baba's gone somewhere and he's not coming back. Hey, shut up. Always a smart aleck. Actually your Shona Da has gone.. ...to the market and still hasn't come back This child is driving me crazy I'll inform him if I meet him Please do Are you mad, Ma? Why? Then why did you say that you are going crazy With you around the nut house is not very far away Let's get to your bath. Let's go... Let me go, I don't want to Is the Pabda good? How much? Give me 500 grams The Pabda won't be good. Take the Tangra, it's fresh. I was looking for you Why? Your wife said that you'd been out for very long. Give me half a Kilo of Tangra Shit! I didn't even notice the missed calls. Tell me about it. I met Sukumar uncle at Bapi's shop.. ...and he went on and on about the library... ...and the lack of members, maintenance.. Hey Shona! Now we are in for it I've got you Doing well? I saw your new play at Rabindra Sadan the other day. It was at the Academy... No, no, it was at Rabindra Sadan. Are you well? Yes It was well written but I have a few things to say about the dialogue. A few things basically means five or six reels worth of footage. In that part where.. ...that guy said that thing to that other guy.. Which part? What's the name of your main character? Arka No, no, not Arka. Wait wait, I can feel it in my gut. I feel like slicing your gut into a million pieces Bloody bore.. He is asleep! This story is told from the perspective of a young boy Age? Let's say 7 or 8 The beloved's name is Paromita,.. ...and the lover's name is Anish The little boy was their… Messenger Exactly He used to help in the exchange of letters and important information. Sorry to interrupt but why are you talking in the past tense? Actually... Because the story is in the present Oh... I see, I see. Please carry on. The little boy is now a young man of 28 years Basically their love story is this boy's childhood memory Let me describe the two characters Anish is a typical hero of the locality Handsome, smart, very talented - Beyond this crowd lies silence Live with me and you will never fear, The words I speak alone, Will slowly change my time. Will slowly change my time. We will break the walls and land upon a blessed isle. Like in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. Because they knew each other from childhood.. ...the two families weren't very wary. But due to certain circumstances.. ...their love did not culminate into marriage. Why? I'll get to that later Paromita gets married to someone else. A few years later even Anish gets married and starts a family. After about 20 years that little boy meets Paromita once again. I see He suddenly revisits his childhood On seeing her.. ...the boy feels that she has come back to the city solely to meet Anish. He somehow feels that once again.. ...he is going to act as a mediator between these two. A mediator for unrequited love Excuse me...! This is the one problem with beer. Interval. Is the little boy today's Monu Chatterjee? The story has stagnated What I said... - Instant! Hero, heroine? Living Amazing! Who are they? One is my cousin from my father's side and the other was my senior sister from the locality Mind blowing But if these two actually do meet… Let them. What's the problem? What are you saying! Their families will just… They might not? It might be that the two of them have a lot to say to each other. You think they'd want to relieve themselves of that now? Listen, Boss, our priority is cinema. And cinema is portrayal of real life Both of us believe that Why can't you take this story as your search? That girl still hasn't come back I'm getting tense. She went out to jog long back. You're tense because she's with you. When she's away do you have any idea when she returns? She doesn't know Saltlake well. She left her cell phone behind. Just look around a bit and then maybe.. I'm late. Don't worry. She'll be back soon. Of course.. You don't have any reason to be worried Ok, I'll look for her myself. Don't In such a case it's more likely that Aheli will return and you'll get lost. Have we reached Shovabazar? It's right ahead. Where do you want to get off? No, I'm not... Just drive around. What happened? I can't go any further Why? If you don't tell me exactly where to go I won't move Listen Dada, a relative of mine lives around here.. ...and I don't remember the exact location. If you take a spin it should jog my memory Madam, could you name the road? Shyampukur Street That's a long road I can't enter any narrow lanes. You won't have to Just take me as far as you can Please! Rubbish! Let it loose, Let it loose you numbskull Now watch We cut it! We cut it! I think it landed in Apu Da's house Should I go? Make it quick Quickly, quickly, go quickly... Shona Da! Shona Da! What is it? I think it's fallen into Paromita Di's house I knew it Monu? Monu? Ya? How can you sleep through the afternoon? Listen? What's your problem? A gentleman has come to meet you Tell him I'm not there Oh Lord! But how? He's waiting outside The man is huge Have you told him I'm in? Do you expect me to lie to him? Why didn't you ask me first? Why? Do you owe him money? Could you please keep quiet! Should I ask him to come in? Do we have an option? Intolerable, the mood swings you all have… Anish is a playwright and Paromita is a housewife May I come in? Yes of course Please sit Will your chair be able to take my weight? Yes, it has taken a lot over the years… Sorry I arrived all of a sudden. Rana Babu gave me your address. Any progress? Well I've been ideating, thinking... Very good, do keep at it. There is something very unique about your concept This young boy seems to be acting as a bridge for unsuccessful love. And we can use this bridge to end the love story on a positive note. What say you? Definitely Actually I don't really understand, it just struck me so... No, no you're absolutely right. I'm just thinking about what events to highlight in the present. Good, good. Then I shall leave you to it Won't you have some tea? Maybe some other time Of course We'll have a long chat Definitely, definitely. Sorry to disturb you at work. But I have to finalise this project before leaving for Bombay. It's alright . After all this is our project. That's the spirit. That's the spirit. See you Yes, for sure. This story has contemporary value. That's what I'm looking for. That's what I need. It'd be impossible for me to find your house.. ...without Ghosh Babu. He knows North Kolkata very well. Oh, really. I'll be off then. We'll meet sometime in the next few days. Hopefully we'd have moved further by then… Yes See you Let's go See you Take care Ta ta Producer? Yes Shona Da? Paromita Di's in Kolkata I knew it Hello? Is Moinak Chatterjee there? Speaking Please hold Hello Monu? It's Paromita Di Ya say. How did you get our number? First I have to apologise about the other night I didn't want to disturb you all any further So I caught a bus home Aheli had got your number from the directory that night itself But she couldn't get through. She tried last night as well I think your mom had picked up I avoided talking to her on purpose Have you decided to permanently settle in Kolkata? Yes We didn't feel like living in Delhi anymore Paromita Di? One minute please How is he? He's fine Could you give me his number? Hey! Hold these... Monu! What happened? These crackers have been bought with your father's money. Wouldn't you like to hear them? Let's go H-A-I-R, H-A-I-R Hair Erase it, erase it, erase it. H-A-I-R means the hair on your head H-A-R-E refers to a rabbit Rabbit - Rabbit, rabbit What is another word for "hare"? Rabbit Ok, then write "rabbit". R-A-B-B-I-T Write it properly I've written it Now we shall write... Shona? What's happened? Nothing Why are you sitting here with your head in your hands? I've got a headache due to extensive writing Don't write anymore Take rest Do you want some tea? No Can't you even take dictation? Listen Have you any news? Write it properly Bouma... Yes Should I send Biltu's food upstairs? It's alright Ma, I'll handle it. Ok. Have you made Payasam for me Grandma? Yes I have Write it again Write it again Same mistake. Erase it... I can guess why Ma decided to move out of Delhi and into Kolkata. It is what I had suspected as a child... Which has now become a pain for me.. ...and now that I have an opportunity,.. ...I want to get rid off it. I'm done with taking chances... Sweetheart! Yes? Busy? No, I was just checking the routine. Come in How is university life treating you? Good The entire environment has a certain flavour It's like a trance Friends? I've made some. But normally I return home straight after class. I play chess with Grandpa. You don't know the game.. ...else I could have played with you. I'm not that calculative.. ...and I also lack the foresight But I have So Daddy... Why doesn't Ma visit Shyampukur Street? But I need to know What do you need to know? Daddy, don't you think that Ma is just stuck to her past? I think.. Dinner ready Anish Babu? Shona? Uncle! Please come in Please sit Tea? Water? This is very sudden. Is there any problem? I have actually come to tell you something I thought I'd tell you in the locality itself, but… Please go ahead I heard that... Paromita's in Kolkata So... So in case you meet her... Tell her... That her mother and I haven't gone blind yet... And would very much like to see our granddaughter Atleast once for old times' sake We won't be around for much longer… I know this is unfair on you... But we have no other option Has she contacted you? No Then I should leave Sorry for disturbing you at work No, no, it's fine. See you later then I cannot wait any longer Why are you acting crazy? Can't you understand my problem? I don't want to understand a thing You have to take a decision But at this point I have no money and no job. I can't run a family on tuition money Are you avoiding me? Paromita, please… We will get married, we'll live together But you're aware of the situation at home After Baba fled no one talks to us properly They've even changed the entrance You are aware of this Once Monica Mashi came into the picture.. Please Paromita Please explain things at home and.. ...buy me a little time.. Proposals have already started coming in And do you think that my parents will alienate you.. ...any less than your own family? Baba has made it clear that I cannot get married to you. Thus we have to do whatever must be done Believe me, I can't understand what to do. This entire hero image of yours is just a facade you are actually a total coward You have to take a decision.. ...and it better be a positive one I won't let go of you Shona Chatterjee Never ever Paromita! Paromita! Please listen! Paromita! Shona? Baba I really wanted to stage “Durgesh Nandini”. I had got hold of the original manuscript from librarian Subodh Babu It was first staged in 1873 at the Bengal Theatre I thought of staging it in that exact form Back to the origins of theatre But, alas! Monica had of course said… Were you in love with Monica Mashi? Were you very unhappy in our family? I wasn't capable of being in any family Family, society.. People's narrow mindedness and growing stupidity,.. ...was something I could never deal with Theatre was my reason for living Our theatre ended and so I fled But why with Monica Mashi? She also wanted to escape We were both runaways… United thus. Not lovers If we were in love we would not have fled Ok That means true love does not warrant… Have you told your mother? No I couldn't Although I tried a lot... I couldn't... Listen Baba... Catch a bunny, With some money.. All our art is just a farce, burn it whole.. Catch a bunny, With some money.. When you go to make a film.. Butter a man who is fat, not thin.. Catch a bunny, With some money.. Are you laughing? I'm speaking the truth! If Gurudev was alive today, this is what he would have written. This is called a social parody Catch a bunny, with some money.. Pour me a peg Don't overdo it. Your wife will get mad. But that's the fun of it I'll drink and the wife will go mad I've become a real bore after marriage Here you go For creative people, getting married is a real blunder Never get married. Never. Make love, like crazy. You'll stay fresh. But marriage? No. Never Your delicious love making will rot What about the constant support your wife has given you? Forgot about that? That's true I'd be lost without Shumi Nowhere Let's bunk this Let's search for the truth. Truth is always stranger than fiction. Catching the Bunny is my job. I'd never subject you to it. If I did, you'd become just as big a bore as me. Catch a Bunny, With some money.. When you go to make a film, Your Bunny with some beer do fill. Light the fire, light the fire… Light the fire, light the fire… Hello? Can I speak to Moinak Chatterjee? Speaking Aheli Ya, say. Do you recognize me? Yes, yes, it's good that you called.. ...or else I would have got in touch with you myself. Why? Actually I hadn't mentioned it that day.. In fact even Paromita Di doesn't know, I'm working in the film industry Have you heard of Rana Majumdar, the director? No Ok. Actually, I assist him. I see-film making! Yes, and recently we've been developing a plot.. ...mainly a love story. I was actually thinking.. ...about casting you as the heroine in her young age Hello? Thank you, but I'm not interested Why? No reason as such I'm basically not interested. It's a very important role It might be But I won't do it An educated, beautiful girl of today.. ...rejecting a film offer...! Who are you? Do you not believe me? Paromita Di has known me since I was a child I know. That's why I need you Me? Why? I'll tell you when we meet I need to know a lot of things from you What things? As I said, I'll tell you when we meet When shall we meet? Give me your mobile number... I'll contact you Tapas babu, Anish's father's elopement with actress Monica Devi.. ...was unacceptable in the family In fact members of Anish's joint family had alienated them And it was due to this scandal that.. Anish and Paromita's marriage became an impossibility Paromita's parents fixed her wedding elsewhere The date was fixed and soon it arrived The little boy remembers that day clearly For some reason he had climbed up to Anish's terrace Why would you even think of doing this? What were you doing!! Why would you even think of doing this? What happened? Where is your Shona Da? He is at the hangout spot near the Natmandir Even that little child knew that.. ...the truth at that point would be devastating Paromita would have left everything and run to Anish Although he had gone to tell the truth, somehow… Excuse me An interval Pure cinema!! Salil, right? Vipin? What brings you here? I have been transferred from Delhi a couple of months ago How is it going with you? Not badly I own a multigym named 'Physique' Is your office here? 5th floor Give me your number.

He can verbally finalise the deal ...and then we can settle Ok But are you sure? What do you mean? I mean you might feel like moving back to Delhi.. ...once we've sold the house You are very whimsical If I wanted to stay there.. ...why would I have told you to transfer to Kolkata? I'm not saying so... I want to spend the rest of my life here Let go, I'm falling Oh God! I'm the happiest person under the sun I love you, love you... - Let go of me! What happened? Nothing There must be something... What happened? You're not happy? It's such great news Hey sweetheart... Let go! What happened?

Next scene opens with a lamp being lit, frontal left of stage We see Shekhar seated on the chair Shekhar slowly begins to address the audience What are you thinking?

I had asked for your mobile number He said he'd give it but didn't Tell me now, I'll note it down Baba, Ma hit me and now my ear hurts One minute Were you being naughty?

I'm assuming this is Saptarshi Yes How did you know his name? Did Monu tell you that as well? Well... You dedicated your first novel to.. ...Sutapa and Saptarshi didn't you? Biltu! Biltu! This is a very expensive Kurta Well, people don't get married everyday Ya but a 250 rupee!!! Have you gone mad? Do you still doubt it? Just shut up and listen to me Tomorrow at precisely 11 thirty.. ...I'll be there with Dibyendu Da and Ranu Bye No.. What happened? First tell me... What will you wear? Why should I tell you? I better be off. If Ma returns from Deepa Pishi's house and sees… Stay a little longer Impossible 5 minutes Listen, mister, from tomorrow you will have me for the rest of your life Once that happens you'll want to get rid of me Wait One for the road? No If you say so… What happened? What was that? Even this will happen later Excuse me You are becoming a chain smoker What else can I do? Let's go But Paromita... He's not coming I'm sorry Paromita, I didn't mean it that way That's no problem at all I knew Shona wouldn't come Let's go Sorry, sorry Why so late? Massive traffic jam Good evening Ya, good evening Rahul Babu has gone crazy I was just randomly saying that.. Since the story has got stuck mid way.. It might be a good idea to freshen our minds.. With a change of environment in order to complete the story And he just gave me a cheque for the both of us It can be done here... No, no, Rana Babu's suggestion is valid You two need a small outing It'll improve your work Do you have any ideas on where to go? Shantiniketan? Fantastic Very good, very good. That would be the best place for creative thinking! You can't doubt its heritage We'll pick up 4 beers, got it? Alcohol is all you think about Don't talk like an uneducated... Beer does not count as alcohol 4 beers certainly do. Atleast in your case Will you go? Rana Babu! Who? What is he doing here? I'm sure he's come to check how we are spending his money He's a sly bugger If he waits like an overlord I won't be able to write a thing Softly, softly… What a pleasant surprise!! You're happy to see me? Did you think we'd be irritated? It's not that … We think you are an incredibly sensible person Thus there is no harm in you joining our creative venture I'd say this even if you weren't our producer What say you? Ya, exactly! Thank you, thank you. Ok, let's go.. Ok, Let's go I was feeling very restless since our last meeting So I thought I'd come with you'll and.. Then I decided that it should be a surprise Very nice So I drove down and reached the station Well done I remembered you were getting off at Prantik station Exactly I've booked two rooms at a nearby resort Brilliant! I hope you don't mind sharing a room with me Rana Babu No, no. What are you saying sir? Hey Ranada! Won't we get some lunch? It's 3 O' clock I'm too hungry to sleep What? Beautiful What? Strange What's strange? Amazing How many bottles down? Half glass Don't be absurd Half a glass couldn't have… Do you know why we'll make the film? Why? Because Sister-in-law will love it What? Whose sister-in-law? Yours Mine Everyone's I'm not getting you Rana Da - Rahul Babu is making this film.. ...just so that he can show it to his wife What!! For his wife! To show it to his wife You need to explain it to him You... you're awake? I was just slightly drowsy Have you heard of Anasuya Basu Roy? Anasuya Basu Roy, the classical dancer? Exactly, Bharat Natyam This lady is my wife And it was a love marriage Now, the problem is that.. She is so busy that she can't seem to give me any time at all Due to the frequency of her shows,.. ...under the stress of constant travel, teaching and plane journeys... Overcome by stress she has forgotten what love is But... It wasn't like this before As newly weds we'd go on long drives,.. ...stay in ordinary hotels.. But what does this have to do with our film? Poetry, play, cinema and novels are beyond me In fact I can't seem to express myself smartly.. ...in front of my wife anymore That's why with the extra money I have.. I thought of producing a real love story... Once the film is released, I'll book an entire hall.. So that Anasuya and I can watch it undisturbed The film needs to be able to.. ...reignite the spark of love in her heart I'm not pressurising you, Take your own time Let me get us some food All that money spent on a film.. ...just to prove his love for his wife! Mind blowing boss! What romance resides in that mountain of a man Don't you get the feeling that, the whole thing is a practical joke? I feel like a victim of the “Tughlak” complex In the words of Coleridge.. ...it is a “willing suspension of disbelief” To make it clearer Jibananda Das tells us about.. ...a “temporary suspension of disbelief” What he means is... When the world was created the creator was tensionless and calm He was of this world but beyond it. There is no Rahul Bose, sister-in-law or Rana Da In fact he does not exist himself He finds happiness in creation Nice concept, huh? There are lot of FM stations around..

Last night I just thought of your face, so I drew it Superb! Paromita Di also used to draw very well Can I keep this? Sure A fleeting dream does put me to sleep, As a heart filled with desire calls out, So, you know my mother since childhood, right? You could say she raised me What do you think of her? Nice A little temperamental... Stubborn, impulsive... A little driven by emotions But she is a good soul Do you know Anish Chatterjee? Yes, he's my brother Your brother? Yes. He's my uncle's son We live in the same house Oh shit! I'm screwed have you read this book? No. This is Shona Da's first novel Shona Da? It's his pet name Read the book Very important Why are you getting so worked up? If it's that bad let Dr. Mitra take a look No fever, right?

Yes, tell me about it Soumi breeds tension My son has a slight cold and so she's going mad and driving me insane as well What are you reading? Let's see Anish Chattopadhyay, as in Shona Da? Yes Where'd you get this? It was given to me By whom? Aheli And she told me that I must read it An Anish Chatterjee novel has been given to you by Aheli with instructions to read urgently… What's the matter? I can't understand it. But I think it's complicated “The Memoirs of fallen leaves” Is this based on Shona and Paromita's love story? Not exactly but.. ...there are similarities For example it's situated in North Kolkata The hero is somewhat similar to Shona Da... ...and there is a child… Which is you? You could say that Wonderful My intuition tells me that.. ...we will find the climax for our film in this book Brilliant! You may be happy but I'm bloody tense Why are you tense? Things are getting complicated.. I just hope nothing serious… Nothing will go wrong Think positive Monu I'm telling you, just go for the story Just let the story flow Understood? Read Read it carefully I'll attend to Rahul Babu for a bit This is mine Did you read it? Yes Can I ask you something? What? What kind of relationship did your brother and my mother share? Nothing special Just a normal relationship between a boy and girl living in the same locality Why are you lying? What? Why should I lie? You are lying I know very well that your Shona Da and my mother were in a relationship And that was a serious one If you know, then why ask? Because I want to know the truth In this novel your brother has.. ...mentioned a place named Sundarpur... where the protagonists spend a night together You remember? Ma has told me about this place on several occasions Ma said that she went there with her parents And the place is called Baneshwarpur Baneshwarpur is our village house I've gone there a couple of times But I don't recall Paromita Di ever visiting that place I'll reconfirm with Ma when I get home I'm sure Ma went there with your Shona Da Why are you telling me these things? Because you may be able to help me Help with what? I have been very confused about one thing since my childhood and that's about my roots I was in class 4 then... I had woken up in the middle of the night and … The girl is sick and you weren't here So I brought her to bed with me. What's the problem? You will not sleep next to her That's absurd. At least give me a reason.. There is no reason. I just say so I will not let Aheli sleep next to you Why don't you say what you mean? Can't you understand what I mean? Oh God! Do you know what you are saying? You have a putrid mind!! She's my daughter… She is not your daughter How many times will I have to explain it to you? She is not yours! This is a fact and this is the truth Paromita! When I grew up and asked Baba about it He just laughed about it... He said that Ma said it in anger But the question is still haunting me I don't think we should meet each other anymore Who knows... We may be related by blood I do not wait and neither does time, And broken love does softly kill what's mine... But I have hidden the cruelty of time You may not understand but to you I explain How two fingers designed can make river out of plain My dear How was your date? Love, Love, Love… Love, Love, Love… You are drunk Rana Da, go to your room Wow! Atleast I'm drunk on liquor.. ...and not on some random chick Don't talk rubbish? I'm talking rubbish! Ever since we got here.. You've been stuck to that girls' arse like a tick Rana Da please mind your language To hell with your language I'd got you here to write a story... All you're doing is horn balling after some tail I can't write any story What the fuck have you come to do then? Rana da, please mind your language I am not in a good mood Screw your mood - You've come to Shantiniketan to create a love story Now you can't even handle your own Fucking arse hole – Coming to Shantiniketan was your idea And you took the money from Rahul Bose. Now get lost! You raised your hand on me! How dare you.. You are forcing my hand Please get out of my room You dare lay your hands on me! What's wrong? Rana Babu Please take this man away from here Rahul Babu. I just can't stand him Let's go to our room He hit me...! I taught this boy everything he knows I introduced him to the industry And today he... Ok, ok, Let's go to our room We'll deal with it tomorrow morning Why has he been brought here? To think of a story.. I can't think of any bloody story Rahul Babu, let me tell you that I will not be a part of this project I'll leave for Kolkata in the morning Ofcourse you will, bloody coward You're a coward! And you're frustrated too! Now get lost! Let me go... Rana Babu, Rana Babu This not the right time This not the right time Let's go to the room.. We'll talk tomorrow morning Ok, I'm going..

Alright thank you… Let's go... Good night You don't need to carry me Let's go You truly repaid my tutelage Let's go... There is someone in reception who has come to meet you Ok You? What's happened? Any problem? Ma has run away from home Run away from home! Where to? She hasn't said anything Baba had called He said that he woke up in the morning and Ma wasn't there She left a letter on the dining table... Which said, “I am leaving. Don't search for me.. ...I'm never coming back” Have you informed the police? I don't know. Baba hasn't said anything else Don't cry please. Hold on Let me check Give me your phone Boudi? Where is Shona Da? Has he gone to the market? Where has he gone this early? Baharampur! Ok, I'll call on his mobile phone... Shit! No, I just needed his advice. It's ok, I'll talk to him later He's gone to Baharampur on important office work this morning He left his mobile phone at home What stranger plays the flute, Amidst this broken Eden What stranger plays the flute, Amidst this broken Eden My heart does flutter... My heart does flutter... In the footsteps of my soul What stranger plays the flute, Amidst this broken Eden It's been a long time Shona… You're very angry with me, aren't you? You think... I've blackmailed you into coming here I have come of my own accord Paromita I knew that I would have to tell you someday.. ...why I didn't turn up at the registry office Now I'm ready I don't want to know There is no point I'll never get that day back But I have to tell you... I have never been able to forgive myself.. ...for what I did to you For all these years this feeling has been dormant So many years! But I know... If I tell you what happened you will... ...You will forgive me And once you forgive, you can forget me… I can never forget you Shona I never want to Would you like chicken curry and rice? Kangshari Da... That's it The chicken curry is fantastic Let's see Why are you taking so much trouble? You and your wife have come here after a long time It is my prerogative to feed you Kangshari Da? - Yes Wouldn't it be easier just to get something from a nearby shop? You won't find any shops open at this time of day Don't you worry My daughter cooks very well I'll just cut the meat and she'll cook it Do you remember... The first time we came here? A shaft of sunlight fell invitingly.. ...on the pond at the back of the house Where the ducks did flee Madam, madam, what are you doing? Then in the afternoon you were being stubborn... You wanted to see me The condition was that you could only see Everything else would be post marriage You are the one who dishonoured that agreement. No! I didn't, Shona I've been married for so long with a daughter... You are wondering how I saved myself for you? Shona believe me... I have never considered myself married I am merely used by a man... I have told Salil Aheli is your daughter not his But that's a lie. - It is true for me No man can ever take your place Never This is your delusion Paromita... You can't live by holding on to the past The past is the only thing that keeps me alive Shona When I stood in front of you that day... I wished I had set no condition I felt like falling into your arms I wanted to make love to you... It is something I regret to this day Shona I couldn't help it Believe me! Nothing When I was on my way to the registry office... I met a gentleman outside my house Anish, Anish, I've something important to tell you Uncle, I'm in a bit of a hurry right now... No, no, I have to tell you now Listen, we found Tapas Da, your father You need to identify his body Is that your father? What are you saying? That is your father! Anish, Anish, Anish... I refused to recognize my father.. ...although I knew it was him I walked through every alley and by-lane I could find All I was thinking about was how to tell Ma Shona? The prompter, Kanu Babu had come by He said someone had seen.. Your father getting off at Katoa Station Just go and check it out… Wait, wait, I've got Kanu Babu's number,.. ...let me get it When I saw her face I couldn't bring myself to tell the truth I thought if I told her she'd never be able to speak again I had a lot to ask Baba Especially about Monica Mashi I had to reconcile But Paromita, I can't take it anymore I just can't Ma still asks me about Baba I still haven't told her I choke up I can't breathe Over the years... This lie has gradually become an unbearable burden on my soul Shona? I can't take it anymore... Please forgive me... Please forgive me. I'm sorry... We will break the walls and land upon a blessed isle like in fairy tales and nursery rhymes The words I speak alone... will change my time Sleep well? God! Kangshari Da is taking ages to make our chicken curry My stomach is killing me… Monu and Aheli have come How did they know we are here? Wait Let me get them Baba boudi has jumped into the pond! Come here quickly Paromita! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!... - Paromita!... Get up Ma! So this is how the story ends? … What the hell am I thinking!! Look at me! - Paromita... Could you please tell your father… Allow me Come back soon... When my search for a love story began I never thought I'd actually be part of a real life love story But all is well Rahul Babu has got his contemporary love story at least I hope so The script is complete I've reconciled with Ranada I love the man He's really taught me a lot Recently he's been teaching me the nitty gritties of cinematography How's this? - Nice frame As a result of hanging out with me Aheli has also been bitten by the film bug And she is really good! She gives us brilliant ideas pretty often After completing Rahul Babu's film.. We are planning to make another The concept is mainly Aheli's.. ...but I have some inputs Paromita Di is better She seems to have broken out of the trance.. She was in all these years Aheli's father is a very patient guy... He really proves love still exists Salil Da and Paromita Di are now going on a world tour Aheli is very happy about it Now we shall spell 'APPLE' Shona Da has finally managed to.. ...tell his mother about my uncles death It shook her but she didn't break It's probably good for her to be free.. ...of the anxiety and helplessness.. ...she's felt for so long Shona Da is now working on his new play I even heard that Suman Mukhopadhyay.. ...may direct the play The most amazing thing is that.. ...after that day Rana Da has quit drinking In fact he scolds me for having more than two pegs Hats off to him… At the moment.. ...he is sincerely working on the film plan I think our film shall not only appeal to Rahul Babu and his wife but to anyone who loves cinema... Action! Move! - Look here! - "Biplab". - Oh no! - It's your father! - No, he's not my father. - (indistinct) - (Indistinct) - Please check properly. Biplab, Biplab, Biplab... - Great! Nice shot. - Over. - Hey come here! - Let's ready for the next shot. (Indistinct)
