MAN 1: That's enough. Throw one. [MAN 2 SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] MAN 1: Knock it over the fence. [MAN 2 SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] MAN 1: Come on, Ryan. Belt it, man. Belt it. Belt one, Ryan. Come on. You can do it. Oh, come on! MAN 1: Hang one on. You can do it. [MAN 2 SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] And so, at this California migrant labor camp, which is situated, incidentally, on the state's largest artichoke and cucumber ranch, one hears the lively purr of amity and the spirited camaraderie that attends a friendly softball game. MAN 1: Ryan, hit him. Just a moment, please. MAN 3: Come on, Joe. Hold it. REPORTER: Just a minute. Don't cut away. [ALL SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [♪] TURNER: Okay, back it up. Now forward till I tell you. REPORTER: Hold it. Just a minute. Don't cut away. Hold it there. Can you see a knife? How the hell can I? It's behind him. Okay, go ahead. [MAN GRUNTS] Comacho's got 10 friends who'll swear he was unarmed. So Ryan's got 10 friends who'll swear that the spic was reaching for his knife. Well, what do you think? The kid's got a good level swing. His wrists break fine, but he's pulling-- Sam, please. He's stepping away a little. We're talking about felonious assault. What felonious assault? You saw it. I saw a movie. I don't even know why you showed it to me. When Ryan goes to trial, you'll be presiding. I thought I'd save time, show you what we have, so we can get through the examination and set a trial date without a lot of fooling around. All right, Mr. Prosecutor, so you've got a movie. Now, what else have you got? I've got Comacho's statement. Is he the complainant? He hasn't signed a complaint yet. No, and what's more, he's not going to, either. Sam, the guy is in the hospital with a broken jaw! What do you know about pickles? Tell Mr. Turner about the pickles. They make pickles out of cucumbers. That's right. And all those artichokes and cucumbers out there, miles of them, belong to Ritchie Produce. But mostly, they make pickles. And then they take the pickles, they put them in jars and they sell them. And what they don't put in jars and sell, get to be cucumbers. Great, big, grown-up cucumbers. That means they gotta pick the little bastards before they get a chance to grow up. But they're not gonna be able to do that if all their goddamn pickers are sitting around a goddamn courtroom waiting to testify. Sam, Ryan's got a record. Two arrests, two convictions. B and E, assault and battery. We just can't let someone like that go. You still don't understand about the pickles. Look, you've got nothing to do. Why don't you go fishing or something? Take a boat way out there, you're all alone. And just throw a line over the side and that's it. That's all there is to it. I don't fish. I don't give a damn whether you fish or not. Take a bottle of booze or a broad out there and just relax. Forget about Ryan. Uh, if it will make you feel any better, I know this Comacho. He's the meanest son of a bitch you'll ever meet. Carries a knife as long as your... Well, maybe longer. [♪] Here. What's that? There's a bus going north at 4:00. Yeah, well, look, boss... No, you don't work for us anymore. How about giving me a ride back to the camp so I can pick up my gear? I'm sorry. We don't want you around the camp anymore, but... There's an extra $10 for your gear. I'll give you the best reason I know why you should be on that bus. Comacho gets out of the hospital, finds out you're still around, he'll put that knife in you so fast, you won't even feel it go in. Well, thanks a lot for the advice, Mr. Rogers. I sure appreciate it. Your, uh, shoelace is untied. [♪] [CAR TIRE SCREECHES] Why are we stopping for him? Thanks a lot. How far are you going? Five mile road. The farm labor camp. Hop in. Thank you. You're not one of the pickers, are you? Uh, not anymore. Ryan. Jack Ryan. Good guess. I'm Ray Ritchie. El pepino grande. What's that? That's what the pickers call you. I'm afraid to ask what it means. The great cucumber. [ALL CHUCKLE] This is Nancy Barker, my secretary. I hope you understand why we had to let you go, Ryan. Pickles. What I can't figure out is what a guy like you was doing on Comacho's crew in the first place. We don't get many Anglos willing to do stoop labor. Well, I bummed a ride off Comacho. His bus broke down. I fixed it. He offered me a job. I wasn't in any hurry to get anywhere. Are you the one who hit that guy with the baseball bat? Yes, ma'am. Ray's foreman tells me you have a police record. Nancy. [NANCY CHUCKLES] B and E, and, uh, assault and battery. What's B and E? Breaking and entering. You mean, you just go into people's houses and take things? There wouldn't be much point in it otherwise, would there? Have you ever been in prison? Ninety days once, in a county jail. What's it like? Being in jail, I mean. A little like doing stoop labor. Well... [♪] RYAN: Thanks a lot, Mr. Ritchie. I thought I told you to stay away from here. To tell you the truth, Mr. Rogers, I wasn't expecting to see you out this way. Hey! What do they call him? What do you mean? Well, the pickers. Don't they have a name for Bob, too? Oh, yeah. Little pickle. [CHUCKLES] That's funny. Very funny. Listen, Bob, I'm driving back to San Francisco right after lunch. As soon as that Ryan character gets his gear packed, you drive him back into town and make sure he keeps going. Any more trouble around here, we'll have that goddamn union organizer on our necks. Yes, sir. Nancy's gonna stay at the beach house. So check in on her once in a while. See if she needs anything. I'll be back down next weekend. Yes, sir. Bye, Bob. You be sure and come by. [♪] You, uh, see that? That's a bus depot. The buses leave from there. The mind reels. This time it's me telling you. All right? [♪] Here's an extra $10 for my gear. You got a cigarette? No. What's that square thing in your pocket? That's a square thing in my pocket. MAN [ON RADIO]: Grant's batting .140. He has... Believe it or not, one home run for his 21 appearances. Beer. MAN: 25 cents, please. Hey, slugger. Have one on me. I know you? Hell, no, I'm just one of your fans. I've seen you in the movies. What? Yeah, they got a movie of you belting that guy, you know. Yeah, yeah. I heard about that. MAN [ON RADIO]: Frank Lesley... You stand in there real good. How come they showed it to you? Well, I happen to be the justice of the peace around here. Sam Mirakian. What's the beer for? I'm on the chamber of commerce, too. I think I'll leave before the lecture starts. No, heh, no, sit down. I ain't going to give you no lecture. What do I look like? A nice, clean, old man? Well, maybe just the last part. [CHUCKLING] [♪] Hi, Bob. Are you looking for me? I got my boat out. I thought maybe you'd like to take a ride. Well... Maybe. Listen, will you come and bring me one of these little towels? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Sit down. We don't have to go for a ride right away. Oh. You've never told me about your wife, Bob. Is she from around here? Yeah. Heh, you know something? I bet you two went to school together. And you've been married, let's see, about 10 years. Nine. Hmm. With 3 and a half children. No, two. A boy and a girl? A boy, 8, and a boy, 6. Are you their big buddy? I mean, do you take them hunting, and fishing, and things like that? [NANCY CHUCKLES] Well, sometimes, I... Gee! Oh! When you take a sunbath, you don't kid around, do you? Oh. I'd like to do something. Uh, what? Go somewhere. Have a drink. I don't know. We could go inside. No. I'm tired of sitting around that house. I wanna go where people are. I don't know about that. Bob, would you bring me one of these towels? Aren't you afraid your wife might see us? She's down in Fresno visiting her mother. With all the little kiddies? And what did you tell her daddy was doing? There's one thing I don't-- Do you wanna take me out or don't you? Yes, I want to take you out. [CHUCKLING] The little pickle, heh. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You know, my mother is probably wondering what the hell happened to me. I got my discharge down south two months ago. Fort Bliss. I guess I've been more or less on my way home ever since. She's probably got my old man's uniform all cut down to size. Pressed and ready to go another 20 years. He drove a bus. I've never been to Seattle. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Which reminds me, I missed mine. Missed your what? My bus. Oh, Rogers, that horse's ass. He's gonna blow his marriage and his job, bringing her in here. I thought you told him to leave. Who? The baseball player. He's certainly taking his time about it, isn't he? More than I gave him. Maybe he's not going to go at all. Oh, he'll go, all right. He'll go if I have to chase him down the highway with a stick. You don't want to get mixed up with him. You know what he did to that Mexican. What the hell are you trying to pull? What are you, the lone ranger or something? Sam, please. This is company business. Company? What company? He ain't working for you anymore. He's working for me now. What? All right, then I'll make it private business. You wanna come outside? Don't press it. You want me to pick you up and carry you out, huh? Now look, Bob. I asked this guy to come over here and have a beer with me. I'm not through yet. And he ain't through yet. We may have another pitcher. Hell, we may have 10 more. I don't know. What I'd like to know is, are you gonna just stand there until we're finished? Listen, why don't you get your friend, come over here and sit down? Have a drink. Come on. Look, either, uh, sit down or go and stand someplace else, all right? You're leaving that young lady all by herself, Bob. Now, is that nice? What would Mr. Ritchie say? What would your wife say? Don't be surprised if you see me again. Oops! Excuse me. [LAUGHING] You seem to have a way with people. Let's get out of here. MAN: Thank you. [LAUGHING] I could have handled it. Oh, heh, yeah, sure. But no, I meant what I said about you working for me. Doing what? Well, I've got this place up the coast, Bay Vista motel. You know, some housekeeping units, some rooms. It's got a pool and nice beach. I need somebody to help me keep it in shape. Room at the top. Fifty bucks a week, and you get your board and room. What the hell is wrong with that? All the way from fruit picker to janitor in one day? You're not a janitor. Heh, you're a handyman. Why me? I said I like the way you stand in there. Well, why not, for god's sake? What else are you gonna do? Bum around, get yourself in trouble? A guy needs a place to live, something to do. You know, a kid like you needs a break once in a while. I know, buddy. I've been there. You going to protect me from Rogers, see nothing happens to me? Jesus, you're stupid. I'm not giving you anything. You work for me, bud, you work. Find out you're a bum and I'll toss your ass out of there. I'll think about it. Well, thank you, Mr. Dimaggio. I sure do appreciate the favor. You feel so goddamn generous tomorrow, you give me a call. That's the Bay Vista motel. Mr. Mirakian said you could have whatever you want. I didn't ask him for anything. [♪] [PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]: ♪ Aah, aah, oh, yes ♪ ♪ Aah, aah ♪ What'll it be? Scotch and water.

I know what you mean. What do you do after work? After you've finished all that shorthand and typing. Why don't you come over tonight and find out? Where is it? It's about a mile. Stone staircase with a lamppost at the top. You know, I might do that. The light's green. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Not you, too, for God's sake.

Just up the beach. I believe it. You wanna walk? That's what I was going to do. I believe it. Do you wanna take a walk or don't you? I do declare, Jack Ryan, but you say the cleverest things. It's enough to sweep a country girl like me right off her feet. I was just wondering. How does a girl like you get involved with Ray Ritchie? You mean a nice girl like me. Yeah, something like that. Does it really matter? How old are you? How old do I have to be? You know, it's, uh, an odd thought, but you must have parents somewhere, right? A mother and a father. I mean, what do they think? I'll tell you exactly what mother thinks. "Now, now, dear, you know very well you're not Mr. Ritchie's mistress. You're his secretary, dear. So let's not have any more silly talk about it." That's what mother thinks. You know, last year Ray and I traveled all over the state together. I was Miss Perky Pickle for Ritchie Produce. And we had our picture in all the papers. And mother cut them all out and pasted them in a big scrapbook. You know, I remember when I was about 14 years old, I tried to shock her. I told her I was selling it to all the boys on the block. She locked me in my room until I'd admit it wasn't true. Was it? After that, it was. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] Oh. Did you ever kill anybody? I mean, you were in the army. You were in Vietnam. Yeah, for a while. Well, did you kill anybody? I suppose so. Was it fun? I never hung around long enough to find out. I wasn't trying to win any goddamn war. I just wanted to stay alive. Did you make it? For the girl who has everything. Mm. [CHUCKLES] Rocks! So they are. So they are. Heh, just like these. Only don't get them too big. What the hell for? For throwing. Kicks, bounces! Come on! You know, when I was a kid i used to collect stamps. [♪] Hey, hey, hey. What the hell are you doing? I'm just gonna hit the weathervane. RYAN: Oh! All right. Heh. Missed! [GLASS SHATTERS] Damn! Missed again. Come on, let's get out of here. [GIRL CHUCKLING] No! I guess there's nobody home. I want to do it where there are people. And give somebody a heart attack? I wanna see their reactions. You mean, you just wanna stand around and watch? Yes, I just wanna stand around and watch. [NANCY CHUCKLING] [BOTH PANTING] Hold it! Hold it, huh! Hold it, hold it! Listen, listen, let's forget this and go get a drink, all right? You want a drink? All right, I'll get you a drink. Come on. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN: We'll have straight bourbon. All right, now you go around back and put one through the kitchen window. What? Are you crazy? Are you crazy? We can't do something like that. Besides, I haven't got anymore rocks. Here. But you have to promise to pay me back. Now, hurry up. Okay. Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GLASS SHATTERS] [♪] Come on. [SCREAMS] You see anything? MAN: No. [CHUCKLES] You know, I must be out of my mind doing something like this. You know what happens to me if I get caught? Well, that's the whole point, isn't it? The risk involved. It wouldn't be any fun if there weren't risks. Heh. You know, I remember when I was a kid, about 13 years old. We used to live in this apartment building. I would go up on the roof and hang over the side. I could hear the cars below me, four stories, but I'd just hang there by my fingertips. Oh! I'd hang there about a minute or so, then I'd pull myself back up. You know, the risk was part of it, I guess. But to me, it was the feeling that I had done something. Just knowing I had the nerve. I like that. Not here. Ahh. Not now. Mm. Booze doesn't get you up there, huh? [CHUCKLES] Tell me about B and E. Well, first you break, and then you enter. And then you take things. No, not at first. Sometimes you just look around, get the feel of the place. The quiet. Being alone with other people's personal things. The feeling that something is just about to happen. Is that all you did? You see, I used to work for this carpet cleaning company and I'd do a job, then I'd leave a window unlocked. I'd go back at night and go in. Heh. I guess I was kind of a nutty kid. [CHUCKLES] But you did take things, didn't you? You were arrested for stealing, you know-- Burglary. Burglary. Let's do it now. [MOANS] I mean, break in somewhere. What? Are you kidding? Come on, wouldn't you rather just collect rocks or something? No. I don't mean we have to take anything. We'll just look around. I wanna know that feeling, Jackie. Inside. Heh. Come on, Jackie. I wanna hang from that ledge too. Oh, you think that might be fun? I think it might get me up there. [CHUCKLES] Come on. [DOOR CLOSES] They don't have very much to offer. Well, maybe they weren't expecting us. Kitchens aren't much fun. Heh. I like bedrooms best. [CHUCKLES] They must live on catsup and milk. Nancy? Nancy? Nancy? Hey! What are you doing? I'm waiting for you. Take off your clothes. [CHUCKLING] Everything. [CAR APPROACHES] [CHUCKLING] [♪] RYAN: You miserable... Take off my clothes. Get out. [♪] Nancy! And, uh... Then there is a busted window, number 12. You know, that, uh, broad with the little girl. Finish breakfast, I'll take you over to the shop and get you a hunk of glass and some putty so you can fix it. You do know how to fix a busted window, don't you? Hey, where the hell are you? Let me guess. Disneyland. [CHUCKLES] Well, it helps to be colorblind. No, you know, my daughter, she, heh... She took this correspondence course in interior decorating. She came up from Fresno and did the place over for me. Ah, well, what do I care? It makes her happy. No, you know, if my wife were still alive, the whole place would be Chinese red. The signs are a nice touch. You know how to drive a boat? What kind of boat? Forty-five foot, twin-engine, diesel. I suppose I could learn. Why? Oh, they've got this old, uh, tug up for sale over at the marina. Five thousand bucks. It wouldn't cost too much to set it up for fishing, you know, with live bait and all. So much a head... Cut rate for the people staying here at the motel. What do you think? Everybody call me captain? What are you, a college graduate or something? You want an executive position? Boy, you ain't even got a trade. [PHONE RINGING] It'd beat the hell out of driving a bus in Seattle. Yeah? Speaking. It's for you. Who is it? Mr. Ritchie. What does he want with me? How the hell should I know? Ask his secretary. Kind of shakes you up, don't it? [CHUCKLING] Hey! Hi, Jackie. Listen, Ray called, and he's bringing some people down. It's a very big deal. RYAN [OVER PHONE]: So what's that got to do with me? Well, don't wander by or drop in, or anything like that. Okay? RYAN: When am I going to see you? I'll let you know, Jackie. What's the matter, stud? You look like the mouse that got swallowed up by the pussy.

Why don't you come over and I'll cook you dinner? You look like you could use a good home-cooked meal. [CHUCKLES] We've got three steaks in the refrigerator. I wanna see you, Jack. Are you gonna have dinner with us, Uncle Jack? You bet I am, princess. [CHUCKLES] Where's fatso? The senator is a very important man, nancy. So? He could be very useful to me. I thought he wanted a drink. He does. Well, where is he? Playing hide-and-seek, or what? He's inside. Good. [MAN AND WOMAN CHUCKLING] Get a load of Tarzan and Jane. [SCREAMS] You know, Nancy, the senator has taken a liking to you. And just what am I supposed to do about that? That's your business, sweetie. I'm in produce. He's in my bedroom. It might be handy for you to have a car around here during the week. I'll drive back with the senator. What if I don't play? You know, Nancy, if I had to replace you, it might take me almost a week. Oh, Nancy? He'll want his drink too. [SCOFFS] Well, he's, uh, 45 years old, but he's really a wonderful person. Very warm, very understanding, very intelligent. He's very handsome. We've been going together for almost two years now. Uncle Chuck. Heh. I'm not... ...going to tell you his name. He's married. Any man who's not married by the time he's 45 years old has got something wrong with him. Well, his wife won't give him a divorce. Has he asked her? Well, of course he has. He wants to marry me. What's the hang-up? I don't know. I'm so tired. What do you do? Do you just keep on going? I don't know. What do you do? If I find out, I'll let you know. I'm all ready for bed, mommy. WOMAN: Come on in, honey. Say good night to Uncle Chuck-- Jack. Ahh. Oh, Jack. I'll tuck you in. Good night, princess. Good night, Uncle Jack. I'll be back in a minute. Come on. Listen, I think I'd better go. The hired help's got to get up awfully early around here. No. Please stay and make yourself a drink and I'll be right back. Please. All right. [SIGHS] I don't know what to tell Cheryl. She adores him. She adores every man since my divorce. Of course, he's been better for her than her own father ever was. That's what she wants-- why are you telling me all this? Who the hell am I supposed to tell, Cheryl? I've got to talk to somebody. I'm sorry. He brought his whole family up here for the summer. They've got a house on the beach. So I came up here to be near him. Not to cause any trouble. Just to be here if he wanted me. Do you know what he said? Do you know what that son of a bitch said to me? He said, "What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?" I don't know what to do! Tell me what to do! [THUDS] What's that? What is it? It's nothing. Just the wind. It's the best meal I've had since before I went into the army. Please. I've got to go. Thank you. Goodbye. Who's your little girlfriend, Jackie? You haven't been cheating on me, have you? I thought you had a business meeting tonight with Mr. Ritchie and his big shot friends. Where are they? They went back to San Francisco. Did they go away happy? I'll make a deal with you, Jackie. I won't be jealous of your work if you won't be jealous of mine, all right? Jackie, Jackie. Come on. Show me around. [♪] All right, but no rocks. If you break any windows around here, I'm the guy who's got to fix them. This is what is known as the swimming pool. I'll go along with that. And out there, that's the Pacific ocean. Show me your room, Jackie. I want to see where you sleep. Comfy. It's all right. The bed's nice. Well, that's the important item, isn't it? Come here. How much does he pay you? [HUMS] Fifty dollars a week. And fringe benefits like little miss "Door slam" in number 12? I thought we made a deal. [MOANS] I know a better place. Where? The morgue? [CHUCKLING] Ooh. Come on. Jackie. Do you wanna be a janitor all your life? Handyman. Still, $50 a week, cold beer and a late show. I don't know. Mirakian's been talking about getting a boat. You know, one of those sport fishing boats. He'd like me to run it for him. That wouldn't be such a bad deal. Have you ever been to bed with anybody who smelled like fish? Yeah, well, I wouldn't care very much for your job, either. Neither do I anymore. It stopped being fun. What else are you going to do? I don't know. You ever thought of doing something real? Real? Or do you mean dull? Does it always have to be the same? I could do anything I wanted to if I had the right reasons. I'm real, Jackie. Touch me. If only the Ritchies of this world could be more like the Ryans. I'll race you to the boat. You haven't got a chance. [♪] [SIGHS] Sounds good doesn't it. Yeah, it sounds good. It's $50,000, Jackie. Think about it. How do you know? I saw Ray put it in the safe. He puts it there during the week and Bob Rogers takes it out and pays the Mexicans on Monday. How do you know there's $50,000? You multiply 350 workers by $150 apiece and it's $52,000. Listen, I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that I'm some big-time criminal. I was 18 years old when that happened. How old do you think I am? Oh, Jackie. Take a deep breath. Smell the sea. We could buy a boat like this, go to Newport, Acapulco, anywhere. Do anything we want to do. No Ritchies or Mirakians. Just you and me. Screw them all. We could also get caught. Well, that's part of the fun of it, isn't it? The risk involved. [BOAT APPROACHING] Oh, damn! Oh, I forgot. Ray called Bob and told him to bring the boat into the marina. We better get out of here. [♪] Hey! Who is it? What are you doing? Mr. Ritchie? Nancy?

Cool it, will you? Hey, come on. What are you doing? I'm teaching them a lesson. BOY: Hey, wow, lady! You want to kill them? Let them alone. [CHUCKLING] No, I wanna ride. [CHUCKLING] BOY: Hey, wow! Come on. What is this? Hey, lady, back off! Back off now. I'm not kidding. Back off. What's the matter with you, Jackie? Are you a chicken? Yeah, I am. Back the car off them, please. You wanna kill them? Come on, lady. We've had it, all right? I'm not kidding. Get your hands off the wheel, Jackie! [HONKING] [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Let's get out of here, Jackie. All right, I'll drive. Yep, that's it all right. Go on down. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: 134-A, 981, B-47, 981, b-403... 1-11 clear. 124-F, you're now on the air. [WOMAN ON RADIO CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] You're doing all right for yourself on a janitor's salary, ain't you, stud? [CHUCKLES] Boy, you must really feel bad. No wise-ass comebacks. Nothing. What happened to you last night? You speaking as my employer, or justice of the peace? [CHUCKLES] A little edgy, too, huh? What's the matter? The fuzz make you nervous? Why should they? Suppose you tell me. What did they want? No, nothing. Just shop talk. 2 kids got run off of route 5 last night. Hit and run. Man and a girl in a late model convertible. The guy was driving. Are they all right? Who? The 2 kids. Oh, yeah, they're gonna be all right. A few busted bones, that's all. They were lucky. Does that come as a relief to you? Listen, you got something on your mind, why don't you spell it out? All right. I don't know what you've got going with that little pussy and I don't much care. But if you ain't in trouble already, you sure as hell are gonna be. Now, i'm ain't gonna blow the whistle on you. But I ain't gonna stand in anybody's way, either. So if you want to tell me about it now, maybe I can help before you dig yourself into a goddamn hole. You know what day this is? Yeah, it's thursday. That's my day off, isn't it? That's right. Anything in my contract say I gotta spend it with you? No, you can do what you want. [♪] [ENGINE REVS] [TIRES SCREECH] Is that uncle jack? Uncle jack? That's what mommy calls him. The world's full of relatives, ain't it, kid? [♪] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good morning. [CHUCKLES] What's your problem? Where were you last night? When those two kids tried to drive their car upside down, you were there, weren't you? Jack. Weren't you? [CHUCKLES] You really are uptight this morning, aren't you? Would you like to know how they are? How are they? What if I told you they're dead? That would teach them a lesson, wouldn't it? You really don't care, do you? [CHUCKLES] They were a couple of smart-ass kids. They had it coming to them. Anyway, they're going to be all right. What a relief. Do you want a drink? It's 8:30 in the morning. I know what time it is. I just wanted to know if you wanted to have a drink. Listen, we got to do something about that car. The front end is banged in. In one month, Jackie, we'll have our own car. Maybe we'd better forget about that. Heh, $50,000 lying there for the taking, and you want to forget-- Let's say I don't like the way you drive. Jesus christ! You're a barrel of laughs this morning, Jackie. A couple of stupid, punk kids get hurt and you're going to turn square on me. Whatever happened to old hang-from-the-ledge, Jackie? All that nerve you were telling me about. [CHUCKLES] Next thing you know you'll wanna get married and make an honest woman-- The thought strikes terror. Maybe I'd better have a drink. So... The big rooster turns out to be a little chicken. Is that it, chickie? [DOOR BELL DINGS] I'll wait outside. [DOOR BELL DINGS] Good morning. No, we don't need any shoes today. Besides, I don't think it's quite my size. Was that you last night? Was that me, what? I chased a couple of kids off Mr. Ritchie's boat, and they ran up here, through the house. I didn't know if it was you or not. I guess it was me. I found this shoe. Lucky. Do you know whose it is? Tell you what, prince charming, why don't you come in and try it on everyone? And if the shoe fits... Hey, chickie. There's someone here wants to try you on for size. What the hell are you doing here? Just keeping the peace, boss. Oh, you always gotta have something in your hand, don't you? What do you think this is? The goddamn golden gloves? Baseball bat or a club... If you come at me I'll hit you with the heaviest thing I can find. I got a tire iron in the truck. Shall I go get it? If you do and we start swinging at each other, what would we be fighting about? Let's just say I don't like your smart-ass attitude. Oh, Jesus, you're stupid. Look, don't you see she just wants us to fight? Talk, talk, talk. You wanna get out of it? No, I don't. I just... I don't wanna hit you, that's all. You're not about to, unh... [PANTS] NANCY: Wish you had the baseball bat. [BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH PANTING] Hey! What is this, intermission or what? That's not how you do it. That doesn't stop it. You hold your head back-- No, you don't. You put your head forward. Pinch your nose. Blow your nose and then you pinch it-- You're crazy. Everybody thinks you're supposed to put your head back. But you don't. You put it forward. Now, will you try it? Blow it now. [BLOWS OUT] Hard. Now pinch it. That's it. Hey, it works. Comacho is out of the hospital. He heard you were still around. He's looking for you. I just thought I'd tell you. Thanks. Uh, I'll watch out for him. Hey, Bob. If I were you, I'd pay those Mexicans off today. What did he mean by that? How the hell should I know? I'm no farmer. You son of a bitch. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. RITCHIE [OVER PHONE]: Nancy? This may come as a bit of a surprise to you but my wife is coming down there for a few days. Well, that's just dandy. It wasn't my idea, Nancy. She just decided she wanted to spend a few days at the beach. NANCY: That's what she has decided. Has anyone decided what I'm supposed to do? I don't know. Stay in a motel. Visit your mother. Just clear out for a week. This is a big house. Why can't we both stay here? Heh, I've got a big picture of that. You and Grace staying at the same house. Well, why not? Not that she has anything against you. It's just that, basically, my wife doesn't like children. Well, that lets me out. Out of what? The great cucumber robbery. Oh, tell me about it. Oh, come on. The police come down here, they start asking rogers questions-- "You seen anybody hanging around here? "No, except maybe Jack Ryan. The guy down the beach with the breaking and entering record." That doesn't prove anything. But you sure as hell might call it a hint. Well, you'd rather go to jail for hit and run, I suppose. Go on. What if I told the police about last night? Then we're both in trouble. Speak for yourself. You were driving the car. I had an accident! Those kids saw you! You were the one who forced me to leave the scene. I didn't want to. You were the one who ran and the police saw you drive away. I'm a minor, Jackie. You're the great big old adult. You know, I may be crazy, but I get this feeling you're trying to tell me something. We do it tonight, or I go to the police. After it's dark, about 9:30. I mean it. You've got to do something about that car. Bang it into the back of the garage. Smash it up good. Make it look like that's how it happened in the first place. Hey. Jack. Not like this, baby. It's supposed to be fun. Yeah, well, crime may turn you on, but it doesn't get me up there. Nine-thirty, Jackie! You be here at 9:30! [♪] [TIRES SCREECH] [ENGINE REVS] [AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING] The broad in number 12 with the little girl. What happened? She took a bottle of pills. Is she going to be all right? From her point of view, I suppose so. She's dead. Where's Cheryl? Where's the little girl? My place. JACK: Princess. Uncle Jack. Are you a relative? No, no, I'm just a friend. We're trying to locate the rest of the family. I couldn't wake mommy up. She just slept and slept. Your mother was very tired, princess. She's not ever gonna wake up anymore, is she? I heard the policeman say she committed suicide. You know what that means? It means she didn't wanna be alive anymore. Listen, princess-- That's stupid. Try to understand. You see, sometimes grownups, they get tired. They get tired. They don't know what else to do. They just wanna go to sleep. Your mother didn't do this because she didn't love you. I know. Your mother loved you very much. Now I can go live with my daddy again. [♪] I didn't even know her mother's name. [CAR DOOR CLOSES THEN ENGINE REVS] So much for the easy way out. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] Hello, Jackie. [CHUCKLES] Oh. [CRYS] [PANTING] [GRUNTS] [WHIMPERING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] You're late. He's dead. I shot him! You just happened to have a gun? I heard something. I didn't know who it was, so I got a gun. His name is comacho. He came here looking for me. Well, how was I to know that? My god, how many times did you shoot him? I don't know. I didn't count. You shot him coming through the door, didn't you? No! I told you! I was upstairs. I heard something. I waited till I thought he had gone. But when I came downstairs, he was waiting for me. He was violent. What? I mean, you had to defend yourself. Yeah. Yes. Yes. He really was violent. When I came down the stairs before I even had a chance to get at the gun he grabbed me, and tore, unh, my robe. That's simple enough. Well, he did! He tore my robe. And then he just went berserk. And by this time I had the gun. From where? From the bar. I had the gun from the bar. And when he saw that I had the gun and he couldn't get at me, he went into a rage. Heh, that's a good word. Well, he did! He went into a rage. And he started smashing things. He started smashing things! [WHIMPERING] Smashing things! [SCREAMING] Smashing things! You shot him coming through the door, didn't you? I didn't! He broke in. He walked in. The door was open. Because you were supposed to come, Jackie. Do you know why you shot him? I told you why. I mean really why. You thought it was me coming through the door, didn't you? Oh. Why would I want to shoot you? I don't know. Maybe because your whole day was ruined. Or maybe because you thought it might be fun. [SOBS] Was it? What? Fun? It was all right. Jackie, where are you going? Jackie! Listen to me. I'll tell them, I'll tell them, Jackie, that you were here. I'll tell them you saved my life. And that while you were fighting, I ran to get the gun. Jackie! Jackie! Jackie, listen. Listen. Tomorrow we'll go anywhere you wanna go. We'll tell them what happened. Ah! Jackie! [SCREAMS] I can use this thing again, you know. Jackie! I can tell them that you were with him. [NANCY CRYING] [NANCY GROANS] Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! [GROANS] Damn! Damn! Damn spic! It was more fun throwing rocks. PRIEST: "Grant, O Lord, this mercy to thy servant departed that he who in his desire did thy will may not receive the punishment of his misdeeds and that as true faith hath join him to the company of the faithful here below. Thy mercy may make him a companion of the holy angels in heaven through the same Christ our Lord. eternal rest grant unto him, o Lord and let perpetual light shine upon him. may he rest in peace. and may his soul and all the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of god, rest in peace. Amen." Well, I guess there are worse things than driving a bus. Hey, if I ever get back this way, you think that, uh, job on the boat might still be open? You're a pretty bright kid. You ought to be able to figure that one out, captain. [CHUCKLES] I don't like it, Sam. I don't like any of this. You never will understand about the pickles. Look, Sam-- Oh, don't sweat it. A broad like that... It may take 10 days, may take 10 years, but she'll get hers. [CAR STOPS] [SIGHS] Hi, heh. Well, if it isn't little miss justifiable homicide. Do you want a lift? Whose car is this? Ray's wife. Ray gave it to you, huh? Heh, he would have if he'd thought of it. Oh, I see. You just took it, huh? What is he going to do, go to the police? I think he's had enough publicity. None of this ever happened, did it? Come in, Jackie. You know, it's such a nice day, I think I'll walk.
