And there were in the same country, Shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the lord came upon them, and the glory of the lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, 'fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a savior, which is Christ the lord. And this shall be a sign unto you...

Okay, that was David bowie and bing Crosby with "little drummer boy," one of my favorites. Mine too.Really? Yeah, I love the mix of the old and the new with David bowie and bing Crosby. Yeah, good, good. Hey, if some of you listeners out there think you might recognize that voice then you are probably correct. Joining us today in studio is our special guest... Mr. Mason Wyatt.

[Chuckling] I know you all have come up today to talk about an exciting event that's about to take place. But I can't resist talking a little music first, if that's okay. That sounds good. We just found out, of course, that you're a bing Crosby fan. What about some of your other Christmas songs you like? I love all Christmas music to be honest with you. I'm a big fan in general. But Johnny Mathis. Yeah. Perry Como, Andy Williams. Uh, Dolly Parton. Amen. Darlene love, "please come home for Christmas." There you go. John Lennon, "happy Christmas." Uh, John Mellencamp, "I saw mama kissing Santa Claus." [Laughs]Yeah. John Denver and the muppets. Oh, man yeah.That's the best. Uh yeah, the boss of course, "Santa Claus is coming to town." Oh, preach it brother, yeah. But still my favorite to this day is Nat King Cole singing, "o holy night." Dj Baley: Really? Yeah, yeah. My mom used to put that on every Christmas Eve. She would break out the vinyl and put that record on. And I still... Can't listen to that song without breaking down, to be honest. Which is why I’m so excited that we're doing this concert, to honor Christmas, which my mom loved so much. Well I'm glad you brought that up, Mason. Why don't we let our listeners in on what's going on with you guys? So what's cooking? Shelby, what's cooking? [Chuckling] Uh, well uh, um... On December 24th we're having a concert at the farm. You remember when we used to do those downtown, we would put on those Christmas concerts and those cantatas? Yeah, yeah... Chet Adkins came to one of those. Doc Watson as well. Exactly, right. Well I love those, I miss those. I think a lot of you guys do too, and so I wanted to do 'em again. And just kind of wanted to bring things back to the way they used to be. With that in mind, I thought one of the best things we could do is to help out one of our own who's in need this Christmas. And so, we're putting on a benefit concert for the classic Haygood farm, where things have stayed simple. And we want to keep it that way. So the event starts early. You guys will still be able to go to church later on that night. And hang the stocking the way it's supposed to be hung. I think we open the doors at 10 am, and you've got all kinds of craziness planned. Why don't you tell them about that? Uh, yeah, we've got hayrides, a petting zoo. Uh... Food for everyone. Santa's gonna be there. And Mason's going on in the afternoon. And it's a very fair price too, I may say. Am I right? Oh, we think so. It's $15 a person, and kids under five are free. We think it's a great way to spend a very important day with the people that you care about. Dj Baley: I agree, I agree. Let's give our listeners a chance to win some tickets now, if you'll be our ninth caller and can tell us one of your favorite Christmas songs, then we will get you some tickets.
