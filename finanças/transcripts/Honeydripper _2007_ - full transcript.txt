Now, you gonna drink, stokely, or you gonna lay up out back recovering from that busted head you're about to get? Gentlemen... Miss Delilah. Let's behave ourselves. What are you boys doing in here? Out, out. And what are you doing behind that bar? It's just for a minute. That's 60 seconds too long. Maceo, get back there and take that child's place. You bring people their food. Don't be messing with their liquor. Nobody's eating. That's 'cause nobody's here but these couple of lost souls. Haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil. Evening, maceo.

Don't dog me about that, baby, not tonight. I don't want China doll behind that bar. She got to help out. Not behind there, she doesn't. You know she's not supposed to get excited. Not much chance of that in here. Harvest hands all crowded into toussaint's place, young ones. You'll get some of them. They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they're gone. Maybe that's the wages of sin. Ain't no sin happening here tonight, baby, and there sure as hell ain't no wages. Your god want to chastise some sinners, he'd best go on over to toussaint's. Got a whole bar room crowded with them. He's not my god. He's everybody's god. How that tent meeting went tonight? Violonda wood found the lord. Thought she found him last year when they come through. Well, she must have lost him again between then and now, 'cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues. Spirit didn't move you, though? Not yet. Maybe it's too late for me. ♪ So don't take nobody I can't believe you're serving alton stokely. That poor man. Toussaint cut his credit off. Either he gets it here or he drinks that paint peeler Willie pettigrew cuts up back in the swamp. I'm gonna go home, say a prayer for that man. Say one for me too, baby. Outstanding, baby, outstanding. You still got the voice. You think so? Chill down my spine just to hear you. Ty, I'm gonna be a little late Saturday. No need to come in if you don't want to. I made other arrangements. Other arrangements? Trying something new in here. You can't do that. Yes, he can. Yes, he can, darling. This is his place, and he can do whatever he wants. You'll know where to find me when you need me. Put the box on now, Ty? Yeah, put the box on. I'm gonna crank it up some, see if we can draw some life in here. There it goes again. Electricity don't like that jukebox. Must be a short circuit in the juke here. Got to get the power company in here. No, you don't. They turned my juice off last month. I don't want them sniffing around that splice job maceo did. It's nice in here, kind of romantic. I'm gonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around. Don't you wiggle nothing around unless I'm there to see it. You don't worry, folks. Bar's still open. Evening, folks. Evening, sheriff. Your light's gone out. Looks like it. Don't know that that'd be a violation of something or other. We're just about to close up here. Ooh, your wife been cooking? Not tonight. Went to the revival tent. I stood by there myself. Them negroes were singing up a storm. Of course, I just come out here to look in on toussaint. Had that shooting two nights ago. Lots of fighting in there. There is that. Of course, me and old toussaint, we got us an agreement? Them field hands start sucking down that whiskey, hopping them all up with music, there's gonna be some razors drawn. Of course, he'll only call me if it's a fatality. Never been a killing here, Them youngbloods know better than to mess with... Than to mess with Tyrone Purvis. You got quite the reputation around here, Tyrone. People say you put some poor black boy in the grave. Just people talking. Well, you just remember, this is my county, Tyrone. What goes on goes on 'cause I let it. Don't want nobody getting too big for their britches around here. You folks have a pleasant evening. Nigger ain't shit in this world. Speaking for yourself. You ain't had this club, Tyrone, what you think you'd be? You wouldn't be nothing. If that ain't true, then grits ain't groceries. That's a terrible noise. Just the northbound from Talladega. Sounds like it always does. Like a soul being carried away from this life. Come on in, darling, before you catch your death out here. You're lucky the high sheriff ain't seen you crawl out that boxcar. Does he come around here much? Only when he bored. You working that train? Yeah, Kansas City to New Orleans. What'd you get off here for? I got people here. How about you? Got tired of sleeping in the boxcar. Listen, is there a place to stay around here? Switchman shed right over there got a cot. And don't mind the rats none unless you got food on you. I can see you and a good meal been strangers for some time. Look here; Get into town tomorrow, find you need something, tell 'em shack Thomas sent you. They'll know who you're talking about. Thanks. What's the name of this town? Name like that sounds like a good place for a musician. Only night I ever been in jail was a town called Liberty. Sun come up, you'll see where you landed. Boy, you best be out that shed by first light? It's just a weekday's night worth. I owe the chicken man. I owe the ice man. I owe the liquor man. At least you don't owe the electric company. Yeah, that's a big relief. You thinking about closing down. What you think? He's the biggest act in New Orleans. Got him a hit on the radio. He's playing here Saturday night. I figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone and then put them up. Here? You mean, like, in this room here? You know the tomcat club in texarkana? Big Jim Jameson's club. It just went out of business. Damn. Yeah, and since Sam is gigging his way over to Tulsa, it means the date is open. But you ain't never had no guitar... I'm having one now. You just worry about getting these hung everywhere in the county tomorrow. Payday Saturday, he's gonna draw all them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black. They're gonna take me down, it won't be without a fight. Guitar Sam at the honeydripper. Man, this joint is going to jump. Somebody slept in the railroad yard. You all can play that thing. Yeah, I been doing it near about forever. What side of the tracks am I on? The wrong side... For you. What you doing here, then? White folks look right through me. Besides, how much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow? Where our people go for music around here? There's a couple of little places just outside of town at the crossroads. Is it a long walk? You in a hurry? How old is that box you're playing, pops? Second one every made, and the devil got the first one. How 'bout yours? Brand new. I made it myself. Ooh, brand new, made it hisself. Hot dog. That's right. So these clubs... Old toussaint, he runs the ace of spades. They don't have no live music in there. Pinetop Purvis, he runs the honeydripper lounge, but he don't care nothing about no guitar. He won't allow one under his roof. That don't make sense. Well, when a musician put his hand to murder, nine times out of ten, a drummer done it. But pinetop, he a piano man. He kill somebody? That's the story. But if you meet the man, you damn well don't be asking him about it. Ain't seen no mule in a long time. I knew this was Alabama, but that's the stone ages, man. Where you from, boy? Memphis. Down here on vacation? Got in a piece of trouble up there with the white folks, need to bide my time for a spell. Biding the time with them pills, man, boss man gonna fire your ass. Pay no worry about that. I'm cotton-picking fool. You a fool, all right. Where you from, brother bear? Mississippi. Whoo! Then this here's a real step up for you. Folks around here has discovered fire and whatnot. That trouble you in... Have anything to do with running your mouth? Had to do with somebody getting on my nerves, and I had to deal with him. Must have been somebody kind of puny. As I recall, he was about your size. What's this place we at? Nearest town's Harmony. This is Mr. Silas tugwell's place. You better get to picking. Cotton ain't going nowhere. The more you get first thing when the dew's still on it, the more it weighs when it tips that scale. You live here too? You got my sympathies. Hot damn. What's the matter? I got a shock I thought you used to work for the power company. I drove the supply truck. Guitar Sam ain't gonna be playing by no candlelight. I smell bacon. You must have burned your porky ass with that electricity. Breakfast is ready. Where your mama? She already over to the mass. She told me to come here make sure you eat something before you start running around. That is a sweet woman you got. You got one waiting for you if you want her. Who, Nadine? She come in here every night making them cow eyes at you. She seems like the kind that could smother a man. She makes all her own clothes. Darling, that's not the kind of thing a man cares about from a woman. Hey, hey, I fixed it. You ain't done no such thing. It just decided to come back on. Decided? Yeah, just like it decided to switch off last night. You ain't even in the conversation. Miss Nadine makes some good money too, sewing for people. That woman scares me. Last old boy to give her a tumble, nappy carpenter, she cooked for him. Fixed him up all kinds of nice, new clothes. I don't see no problem with that. Well, come four or five months, a man starts to... Sorry, sorry, China doll, but that's just the way it is. A man gots needs. Looks like Nadine could take care of those too. You eat chicken every morning, noon, and night for five months, you get a taste for a different kind of meat. Well, maybe I shouldn't be talking about this around China doll. You ain't gonna say something I haven't heard worse. Well, nappy goes out and has him a pork chop or two, let's say. Comes back one night from toussaint's place feeling no pain and smelling... Like... Pork chops, the way a man will. Now, he falls out on Nadine's couch and commence to snore. Wake up the next morning, find she had taken all his clothes off without him knowing it. The man was dog drunk. Miss Nadine comes back with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says, "baby, I got your breakfast." "Not this morning, Nadine," he says, sitting up. "Don't think I could eat a thing." Well, then she says, "we can't let this go to waste, can we?" And she dumped that whole hot, bubbling mess right in that man's lap. Ouch! Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head. Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she'd have killed that man. You got to admit it, though. Woman is an artist when it comes to that singer machine. Excuse me... Which one of you is Mr. Pinetop? We ain't hiring. I can play anything. Already got me a professional. Guitar Sam really coming all the way down here? That so surprising? No, no. Mr. Shack Thomas told me if I was to come... You know shack? We... we traveled together. When's the last time you ate solid food, young man? Take him back and fix him something, China doll. Standing there all hungry-eyed puts me off my breakfast. That's real kindly. Must have come in on the northbound last night. Look like he got the cooties too, straw in that boxcar full of them. Never cared to travel that way. I was out there riding them rails between the wars. Seen the black half of the country heading west. Rolled past the other half coming back east. Yeah, every one of us scraping for the next meal. This the place. Y'all can tear things down, put things up. Got a lot of potential. Looks bigger in here than it does from the outside. May I help you, gentlemen? Yeah, I'm just showing the man who's gonna run this place what he got. This is my place. You the piano player, right? My name's Tyrone. They call me pinetop Purvis. Pinetop Purvis. You owe $200 to lucky hardaway up in little rock. He's gonna get his. Pinetop, you missed last month's rent. After this weekend. After this weekend, you gonna be the same raggedy-ass piano player who can't pay off his debts. Mr. Simmons here is gonna be the new proprietor. Lucky gave me two weeks. Lucky got a better offer. He can't do that. You don't think so? Whoa, whoa, now. What if we got our payments for him Monday? Saturday night. We... we can do that. Not just no taste, all $200. And I'll throw in 25¢ tip for his messenger boy. In the meantime, we're not open yet. That means you're trespassing. Seen enough, Mr. Simmons? I believe I have. Somebody could do something with this place. Wouldn't take a whole lot of work. We cleared over $200 that one weekend. Couple years back. And we didn't have no Louisiana guitar wizard playing neither. Well, they say he draws them like flies. Yeah, that's what they say. They say, first thing he does is go to the man that owns the joint, sticks out his hand, and wants that cash money put in it. I already sent $50 to his manager. How much you paying him all out? Another $100. We need to clear $300. Well, what I figure is, if we charge folks $2 to get in, then the liquor... What I'm saying is, less he see that green up front, the man won't get off the train. What's that now? About time you fellas run by. We're just about dry here. Boss in? Hey, Tyrone! Whiskey wagon come by. Y'all a day late. Old man toussaint gonna chew you out. Toussaint went over to another supplier upstate. We've just got you, then we're over to the army base, service the officers' club. This...$56. My credit no good anymore? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your hurry? Don't nobody in their right mind sell liquor on credit, especially not to no dark town road house. Well, this is like a special case, see? We got the harvest coming up. Soldiers at the base gonna be let off on leave. Saturday night, ain't enough hooch in this truck to satisfy what we gonna sell. You pay as you go. That's business. Hey, hey, look. You come back Monday, get paid, and take back every damn drop that I don't sell. Look here; We got guitar Sam lined up here. What... what if i... I throw in $5 up front for you fellas? Hey, hey, come on, man! Come on, everybody gives credit. It's the American way. Maybe we could buy some bust head from Willie pettigrew. With that sheriff sniffing around here every night? Land my black ass in jail for good. Then what we gonna do? ♪ Move it on over ♪ move it on over ♪ move over, little dog ♪ 'cause the big dog's moving in ♪ got a load of liquor for a Mr. Lucien toussaint. That would be me. I trust they got my check all right? Don't suppose I'd be here if they didn't. Pull around to the back. We'll help you unload. This better be some Saturday night. Arkansas. How about you? We here just after mama met my stepdaddy. Not much going on in a little town like this. Well, they started up the training base again. Is that right? You been in the army? You shoot people? Fixed radios. They say this new war gonna be a short one. Might be; Might not. I was to Japan. Yeah? What's the people like there? Small. Yeah? About... That high. Speak Japanese. You been to California? Los Angeles. Where they make the movies? You go to movies? I been once. Fine-looking girl like you ought to have been all kinds of places. Well, I'm going to 'em. I just... First I'm going to beauty school when mama saves up the money. Then I'll have a portable skill. Like playing music. Well, my stepdaddy says that ain't a skill. It's an affliction. Come on, China doll. There's business in town you're gonna help me with. And you, young man, you want to point yourself west on that highway, about three miles. There's a mess of people working in the field. It's harvest time. You can stoop and pull, they got a job for you. Wash up them dishes before you go. What I need is for you to go get friendly with Luther, then I just happen in. We can't just ask Mr. Skinner?

I hear tell you done gone and put on a guitar man out at your place. Where you hear that? The breeze. Well, this time the breeze know what it's blowing about.

Tyrone, how you doing, man? I got my nose above the waterline. All right. Here's my baby. What's up, Ty? How's your mama doing, China doll? She's doing fine, uncle shack. All right. Hey, yeah, I'm just telling the boys here about how brother Randolph pushing this deal where our boys gonna be a full part of the service. I carried a rifle in the great war. You know, boys get in the middle of this korean mess, they ain't gonna thank you for your efforts. If we want our full due in this country, we've got to go whole hog. Black folks shooting yellow folks to keep white folks happy? We need to move on from that kind of thinking. Move right on, shack. Then come back and tell the rest of us how it is. That's a hard-headed man. I'd have to ask Mr. Skinner. Of course, you would. And while you're at it, remind him how one of the reasons colored folks come here is to get the lowdown on what's happening. China doll. You gonna let us put up these posters, ain't you, Luther? I don't think that'd be any problem at all. That's awful nice of you, Luther. You looking special today. That's sweet of you to say. Maceo, you go along with the man.

I'm sorry, honey. You catch your breath here, okay? Yeah. So why... why miss spivey gonna give you money? You don't let her sing at the club no more. I'm gonna make her a partner. Partner in what? The honeydripper. But all you ever say, it's just a hole you pour good money into. It don't matter. I'm gonna make her a proprietor. "Tress," like waiter and waitress. Proprietress.

Main thing is, the man is electrifying, and you know what that means. Ooh, okay. Make like we just come by to see how she keeping.

I'm looking for work. You're not from around here. No, sir. Stranger wandering around, no job, that would make you a vagrant. But I'm looking. I got a job for you. Get in the back. I can always use another hand. Yeah, well, I caught this young fella in flagrant violation of the statutes: Gawkery with intent to mope. What's he gonna run me? $3 a day, plus you feedin' him lunch. Now, the sentence... That all depends on how long you gonna need the help. I don't get any trial? Well, sure you do, boy, and a speedy one at that. Meet the judge, judge gatlin. Grab a sack. Dear, I believe it's about that time. Would you care to join me? No, thank you. No, of course you won't join me. You don't partake. That was thoughtless of me. That's all right. So you don't take spirits and what else, in your church? Well, I'm sort of between churches right now. I've been thinking about changing over to the holiness, but I haven't been sanctified yet. There's been a minister in this week. The tent over by the fairgrounds? Church I was raised in, we were pentecostals. They wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church, dancing, any kind of dancing, music, card-playing. It was very strict. They took up serpents. I heard of that. I tell Floyd these stories, and he is... He's horrified. They've always been methodists, Floyd's family. It can be a trial, married folks differing in their religion. And your husband is a... Unaffiliated. Unaffiliated, I see. But he has his social club. The honeydripper. That is such a colorful name. Yes. So he must devote a great deal of his energy to it. It's just him and maceo green runs it, and I go over and cook some after I get off here. Well, that's very supportive of you, considering the sort of environment... I've been in those bar rooms most of my life, miss Amanda. I see. I was a singer. I met Tyrone in the paradise, down in shreveport. China doll was only two. And I was just... Living alone, you know, drinking more than I ought. And then Tyrone... Like a light come into my life. See, people think things 'cause he owns the lounge, but they don't know him. Small minds are never in short supply. People in this town... I suppose they expected that Floyd, being from a prominent family... As prominent as is possible here in Harmony... Would have chosen somebody more... And in school, if you didn't have shoes... I forgot. I was going through some of Emily's old things the other day. I thought this would look just darling on your China doll. I don't think that would near fit her, miss Amanda. Well, how old is she now? 17. My. I must have lost track somewhere along the line. 17? It was a very nice thought. Mama... Mama, they need you at... I'm sorry. Miss Amanda, I didn't know you was home. China doll, we were... we were just recalling how you used to play right here under this table. There isn't any cash money that I know of. She... she sold a good deal of the furniture, but there's still a nice-looking couch in there in the parlor. She didn't care about too much other than singing out to pinetop's place. You're welcome to look around the house, if there's anything your missus might like, as long as it's not something personal to me and Bertha Mae. It's just... She's got to go out in style. Y'all ain't never done this job before. Can't say I have. You want to set your pants out wide, bend over at the hip. And don't be bobbing up and down all the time. When you're up, be up. But when you're on the row, stay down. But most important, you got to get a rhythm. Everything in life got a rhythm, even pulling cotton off the plant. Well, lay it out for me. Not my rhythm; Your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you get it, don't let nothing or nobody push you off it. I'm going so slow. You getting paid by the pound or by the hour? I ain't getting paid at all. None of us are. I suggest you work that into your rhythm too. Let's see more picking and less talking over there. Getting right to it, boss. Them boys frying over there. That's just gatlin's gang. He work them people from can into can every damn day. And when the field's get picked, he bid 'em out to the neighbors. Harvest time come around here, you better sign with somebody fast or get out of sight. I ate a peck of dust today. Why don't you get some water? Only thing wash out the dust is whiskey. Ain't enough whiskey in this world to wash out what I swallowed in my life. What are we playing for? Two bits a hand. Whoo, that's awful steep, ain't it? Hell, I remember playing this game one night. Memphis is boss crump's town. Folks is gambling before they can walk. Caught me a winning streak that cleaned out half the sporting men on beale street. Got up from that table; my money was long as train smoke. What happened to it? I spent it all on fine-looking women. Yo, Mississippi! His name's Hamilton. Hambone! You want in on this? Settle up on payday. That your deck of cards? What if it is? I stay clear of it then. You insinuating? I'm just saying I don't want to play. Looks like dinner. A rabbit is a rodent. Man eat a rabbit, might as well eat a rat. Simple country nigger, afraid to sit down and lose a little handful of change. He awful big to mess with. Don't scare me none. I'm a stepping razor, man. I'm trouble on two legs. Your draw, junebug. Don't be dripping no sweat on my cards. Excuse me, folks. Look here! Y'all heard about the show we putting on at the honeydripper Saturday night. We got guitar Sam! I expect there'll be a nice turnout for Bertha Mae tomorrow. Yeah, folks who wouldn't have nothing to do with her when she was alive. Some of them, maybe. Still got to pay your respects. Slick is gonna have to find him a new ride. That's a terrible thing to say. That's how a man gets over, is all, you know, sugaring up to some woman who's got a job or a bank roll. That's no way to live. Just how it is in the world, baby. Man's got to walk through the gates of hell to get a piece of cheese. Not so young anymore. Lose hold of what little you got. If you lose the club, I'm sure you'll find something else. In this town? Like what? You know, any time you want, I could get miss Amanda to ask her husband... "watch your feet, Mr. Mayor. I just done mopped the floor." Ty, your work so hard at the lodge, and with what you bring in, it's just not... Not even as much as you make polishing that white lady's silver. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. It'll just have to work out, then. Meeting gonna start, and I'm not there. Your soul's not the one needs saving, baby. It's all gonna be fine, daddy.

That thoroughfare I'm talking about, that righteous road that we need to travel is called the highway to heaven. It is called the highway to heaven. But we need to know, sisters and brothers, we need to know who is walking beside you. You got to be wary of who is trying to hold you back from your journey, 'cause many a loved one's got to be left behind. 'Cause you're either on the road, or you're lost in the wilderness. You're either heading for glory, or you're doomed for damnation. You're either with the lord, or you're with the devil. And there ain't no in between. No, no. There ain't no in between. Okay, Memphis. Um, Charleston. Yeah. Tulsa. Tulsa ain't so bad, but for the spics. Got to them stockyards near the jail. Them flies. Of course, I had me in a cell in Georgia once. Six other men. Didn't have a window at all. Must have got caught hopping one of them freights. Yeah. Ain't no free ride allowed through Georgia. And the food there... paltry. Paltry ain't the word for it. Breakfast is a joke, and lunch is a rumor. And dinner was an anecdote. I suppose you got locked in that box.

No, man, he's in the hospital back in little rock. Hospital? You know music folks. Whatever he was doing, must have been doing too much of it. Well, brother, maybe... Maybe he come on in tomorrow?

Don't make no difference now. Got so bad, I heard there was this old boy goes around pretending to be guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he missed. Say he does pretty well for hisself, what I hear. Somebody we could find? Hell, I don't know. Just some story I heard. Must have been the first one. First what? Back in slavery days, they had for us to work in the big house. Might not have had shoes always. Pants didn't have no holes in them. They didn't pick no cotton. House niggers. Yeah, that's what they called them. They had all their African kinds of instruments: Drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing. But the piano... They ain't bring no piano over on those ships from Africa. Piano was just sitting there in the white folks' big room, all polished up. I figured this first one, he must have passed by it 15, 20 times a day, run the corner of his eyes over it. You see, he was there when they played, the masters with their minuets. Him standing there with a tray of white people's food, pretending not to have a thought in his head. But he... He watching them fingers. See, he's watching the keys for... See, this old boy, the first one, he know how to play all them kinds of African instruments. I mean, he could play mud if you give him a key and a tempo. Yeah, got music in his head and his heart. In every damn piece of him, there's music. Then one day, the master's away, and he alone in that room with that piano. Watch out, now. And he goes over, and he sits down on the bench, and he... Spreads his fingers over it the way he seen that minuet player do. And he thinks. And he thinks, "lord, help me; I could some damage with this thing." I would have liked to been there. I mean... Just to hear the cat play. Mace, I'm gonna lose my club. If old man toussaint find out you stole his liquor, you're like to lose more than that. I got no more cards to play. If you was to go down to see lucky hardaway in person... I ain't kissing up to no cokey-nose, coke-headed asshole! What the hell that supposed to be? Some kind of guitar. A guitar got a hole in it. That's how the sound come out. That boy must be three bricks shy of a load upstairs. Daddy, they gone and arrest him. Arrest who? Sonny. The high sheriff arrested him and sold him to judge gatlin. Sonny who? Sonny that was here yesterday morning. Sonny got a screw loose? That's why they arrested him. Mace, play something on that. Make some noise there. It's electric. I could plunk a chunk of stove wood in a wall, and I'll get more music than you get out of that mess. No, man. No, man. It don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice. See, you got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside that box. The music just runs straight from the strings, through the wire, and out... Of your amplifier, which is what this thing must be. Sonny said he fixed radios in the army. Sonny didn't do nothing but feed bedbugs in anybody's army. And some of them crawled in his head. I'm surprised he even got the wit to pick cotton. Judge gatlin done bought himself a drooling idiot. What you gonna amplify a guitar for anyway? Daddy... Unless you gonna sit over in your chair and play those little Charlie Christian types of riffs. A sideman. See him over there, looking all clean and polite. The a guitar, he been up front, since those old piss-and-moan blues shouters sit their blind asses on the corner hollering for pennies. Old-time music. Daddy, Sonny did do nothing to get arrested for. He was just looking for work. They hung colored boys for less than that, darling. At least on the work gang, they feed him, keep his strength up. But he doesn't belong there. You know, guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's... It's this no-hole kind of deal. Hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night and electrocute his sorry, no-show ass. Mace. Now, if he showed up here, and our power went out again while he was playing... No, I fixed it good this time, Ty. So he comes out, and he plugs his ax into a wall... He come out looking good, from what I hear. All kinds of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back. The clothes, right? Hair all slick and shiny. Flash them gold teeth at them gals. Got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, and drums. You remember that night at the esquire club when the lights went out in mobile? Yeah, they took off with the gate. Them drunks just stole the damn register right off the counter. They didn't hold Reggie Porter for it, did they? No, they knew it was his place got robbed. Didn't nobody hold it to Reggie Porter. And nobody expected their money to come back. No, 'cause they was too busy diving for the pot in that tote game got interrupted. And nobody suspected that it might have been Reggie Porter hisself... Hisself that pulled the lights. No. No, Ty, no. No, no, no. China doll, you mind the place till we get back. Hey, come on, mace. Where you going, daddy? I promised the people guitar Sam, and they're gonna get guitar Sam. Come on, mace, let's get out of here. We got work to do. Why you so interested in this boy? Got a job for him. You must be doing pretty well for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hiring new people on. Passing well, yeah. But this boy... Name is Sonny. Well, he's paying off his debt to society right now. If I was to pull him out of the field... Judge gatlin paid for your day for prison labor. You willing to pay for him for the duration of his sentence? Which might be? As long as I care to make it. Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal. If I can rent him out just for the weekend... $50. It's not just the money. There's legalistic principles involved here, public safety issues. I'll pay you sunday morning. You're gonna pay me now, or you can forget about it. I don't have it now. You think you're too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone? Think you can go it all by yourself. You'd rather eat roofing nails than come to me for a favor, now, wouldn't you? It's not a favor if I got to pay you for it. You're gonna pay, all right. If you don't hand over that money to me by sunday morning, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with toussaint. Look at me. You'll get the $50. And that wife of yours. Delilah? Them fried chicken sandwiches, if I was to come in now and then and check in on my interests... She'd be happy to fix you whatever you want. Good, 'cause my wife's cooking would gag a maggot. Different people got different kinds of talent. Yep. Well, Darlene ain't discovered what hers is yet. Let's go fetch that boy. This the one you want? You got any ideas about running rabbit on me, best get rid of them now. Are you paying my way out? Till Monday. How come? You like dragging that cotton sack? No. Then don't ask questions. ♪ Why don't you do right ♪ like some other men do? This size, right? But it's got to shine. And when you need this? Tonight. That's a tall order. It's got to happen. You know, I do my best work, my fastest work, when I'm happy. Yeah, yeah, I suppose you do. You gonna make me happy, baby? You come down by the club tonight. We're having a special show. Tell 'em at the door, you're my guest. Food ain't the only thing a woman needs three times a day. Wouldn't hurt you to skip a few meals. What's that, baby? Um, that boy gonna time to try this jacket on, see how it feels. Later, Nadine. You got to do something with this boy's hair, darling. They may not know what the real Sam look like, but it ain't this. I can try. What exactly am I supposed to do? You're gonna stand up there with that contraption you got and play guitar Sam's numbers. I can do that with my eyes closed. Well, if we can get the audience to close theirs, we'd be better off. Ty, I tracked Mr. Trenier down. Let's hit it. Bye, daddy. You know what you're doing? I fix mama's hair all the time. But you ain't been to that school yet. You go to school to learn your guitar? No. I might pick up some things at beauty school, but mostly, it's for my certificate. And that is "a ticket to adventure." That's what it says in the brochure. People looking for beauty all over the world. You ought to watch out for them wires sticking down. It don't look safe. Yeah, power's always going out, people getting shocks and what not. Somebody ought to fix it. "Career in beauty is like money in the bank." Says that in the brochure too. Plus it isn't physically taxing. Yeah, can't no pretty thing like you behind a plow. I had the rheumatic fever when I was little. It left me with a weak heart. You know, mine been acting kind of funny too. About since I laid eyes on you. What's that? Just some old moonshine they keep around. What you gonna do with it? They joke about how this stuff will straighten your hair right out. I'm gonna just make yours relax a little. Mr. Time trenier... That's a name to be reckoned with. Story goes, you used to play with buddy bolden. I played with them all down there. And king Oliver. One band falls apart, you'll find yourself another. There's never a shortage in bands down in New Orleans. I didn't know you were giving lessons. It pays the rent, almost. Interested in a playing job? If you can pay, I can play. You got to dress sharp. It ain't like an all-night thing. You just got to start out, and then there's gonna be an accident. An accident? Yeah, sudden loss of power. Lights out. It's your gig, man. 8:00. This ain't no colored people time, and sure ain't New Orleans time. I mean, 8:00 on the money. If you got the green, I'm on the scene. Then that's a deal. You know any drummers? I'll bring you one. And nothing fancy, just as long as he keeps time. Time is my name. $21, $22, $24, $25, $26, $27, $28. Make your Mark here, please. Owe me $30. Book says $28. $1.50 every hundred pounds, and I picked... $2 deducted for stones. But there wasn't no stones in the sack. We mill the cotton, son. There's always stones. But there wasn't none in my sack. We take off $2 a week for stones, and that's the way it always been. Ain't that right, junebug? Yes, sir. Been that way my whole life. You gonna take your pay, son, or you gonna give it up to charity? Wouldn't let nobody mess with my money like that. They took the same $2 off yours. Yeah, but you could pave a highway with the rocks I threw in that mess. You country negroes let the crackers run you like dogs. If that sheriff wasn't here, I'd snap your neck, boy! Don't let me stop you. But first, you're gonna sign that ledger like you're supposed to. Don't want nobody crying they didn't get their due. How could you do that? Hey, I'm gonna put it back and double that. You don't go gambling with my baby's money. Hey, I send advance pay, or the man don't come and play. I don't care what you took it for. I saved for China doll, and you ain't got no business putting your fingers on it. China doll don't need any school, baby. I mean, she could walk into any of those places right now and get a job. There has got to be some line you won't cross, Ty. There's got to be some thing you won't do. The lord started throwing me a break, woman, maybe I'd catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like Bible thumpers you sit up with, but until that day... Reverend cutlip was right about you. Horse shit! Mr. Purvis? People call me Ty, or they call me pinetop, Mr. Pinetop to you. I just want to tell you I appreciate the opportunity. Right. I know every one of guitar Sam's songs. I know the chords. I know the words. That's fine. China doll was saying how you was famous once. I was known, but never what you call famous. How'd you get your start? Down in mobile, there was an old cathouse professional name of Joe dudlow. He'd had a stroke on one side. It curled him all up, but he kept on plugging. I used to come out and play his left hand for him. This one night, he was going hot and heavy. Joe just passed, right at the piano, middle of black bottom stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, told me to keep pounding those ivories. There was a meanness hanging over those juke joints. There was murder in there. Stop playing for a minute, come down on you like a flock of crows. Hey, this is you. Big band days on the road. Reginald erscine. Don't believe I've heard of him. Big, tall light-skinned fella out of Carolina. Said he was part cherokee. Couldn't play nothing, but he waves his little stick, and he had this long, greasy hair he'd throw around like cab Calloway. And you were the piano man. Piano man, arranger, you name it. Must have been something to travel the country first class. I don't know about first class, but we seen the country. How could you stopped? I got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in who-knows-where, Arkansas. Met Delilah. Wanted something of my own. You don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight. No, i...

Honey, I need you to get right by that front door and take over collecting the cover charge, and anything happens, go wrong or something, I want you to just step out and walk away from the club, you hear? What's gonna go wrong? Well, our guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping. It can get a little rough in here. Just stay on your toes, that's all. Okay. All right. Hey, China doll, you know there ain't a thing in this world I wouldn't do for you, even if I mess up sometimes. You know that, right? I know that, daddy. You go on now. Well, you like something that would come out of New Orleans. I forgot to tell you. I fixed your hookup. My what? Your hookup where your electricity comes in. It was all messed up... Hey, Ty, got a situation out there. You don't think I know that? Got the law in the house. Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon. Got a real nice crowd here tonight, Tyrone. See them army uniforms. Yeah, we got ourselves this special attraction, you see, and... Chicken. Them ribs outside smell real good, but I'm afraid my heart's set on some of your wife, Delilah's, fried chicken. Right. She made it last Saturday at the mayor's, but old clayford gentry came up from ofelia, and he ate all the drumsticks. I'm partial to dark meat. The situation we got, sheriff... She is in the back there cooking it, isn't she? Maybe if you would come back here a little bit later... Regular or spicy? They both take the same time to fix up. I just got to know which. I have to make mine regular, I'm afraid, ma'am. Spicy's just fine, but it always comes back to nip at me later. It's important not to bite off more than you can chew. Yeah. Well, you just make yourself at home. Good luck tonight, baby. Slap some mayonnaise on it? You want to wait over there, sheriff? Don't want to scare off the customers. Here he comes!
