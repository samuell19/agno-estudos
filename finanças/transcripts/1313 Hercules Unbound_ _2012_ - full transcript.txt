I, Zeus, the father of Mankind and long its benefactor, decreed ions ago that the time of the Gods in the world of Man had past. By then, I had fathered many children, some divine, some mortal -- all of them possessing skills needed to further the humans taming of a dangerous cosmos. One of my sons was Hercules and his strength is spoken of to this day. However, my wife, Hera, was jealous of Hercules... I am Hera, wife of Zeus. I will never understand his fondness for his mortal offspring, particular those sired by others, undeserving. Hercules was the most offensive; his gifts wasted. So, I vowed to murder him. I am Athena, Goddess of wisdom. Knowing of Hera's drive to kill Hercules, and seeing his potential, I proposed sheltering him, hoping her murderous intent would wane. But even I could not foresee what would happen at my retreat. Athena, what's the meaning of this? How do you mean, Hercules? Why did you summon me here? My studies, my friends, my mother, they all reside in the city. Sometimes we learn most when we are removed from what we know. Aw, You speak in riddles. You always have. I wish to further your studies. To perhaps embolden your physical strengths . I am the son of Zeus, I have physical strength beyond all men. Excuse me, Athena, is now a good time? Yes. Please meet Hercules. Hercules, this is your trainer, Pronax. He's fought valiantly in many campaigns. The mighty Hercules. Your reputation grows. As it should, my brother. Forgive me, but I still don't know why I'm here. But I will amuse Athena. If you'll excuse me. You haven't told him of Hera's anger towards him? He knows her intent, but not how close she is to succeeding. He would be wise to increase his humility; hubris only clouds ones reaction or lack there of in matters such as this. I know. I fear it may one day be his undoing. I will work to convince him to let go his over- chilliest attitude. Your wisdom will no doubt help him. I will prepare to meet the others. Why are you following me? Whoo, Apologies, friend. I was merely hoping we might travel together. The only two destinations for anyone out here are the Warrior's Training Camp.. And oblivion. I'm surprised you caught me. Not many do. I can see that. I'm Thestor. Dolon. I don't wish to let the sun set before our arrival. The plains can be dangerous come nightfall. Understood. How did you come to be invited to the Warrior's training Camp? I am a runner. That is what the Gods have blessed me with. Clearly. I am sadly a master of no one pursuit, but wish to learn more. Though I clearly will not best you on foot. I was invited by a minion from Athena herself. Apparently my renown gains favor. I am honored regardless. As you should. I fought alongside Pronax, the lead trainer. What he saw in me I'm unsure, but I certainly admire his patronage. You know I've heard rumors that this is to be a very special retreat for the. warrior set. All retreats are special. It is an honor regardless. Even if there are rumors of a certain warrior's presence. I pay no attention to rumors and gossip. Of course, Dolon... We are already honored. To wonder about the Gods intentions and machinations is only inviting trouble. Even if we are training with the mighty Hercules? Perhaps we should run the rest of the way. Thestor... Thestor, were you serious? Abderus! You miserable dog! Hercules! It has been too long. Yes, How many seasons have passed since our childhood? Many. Oh, I have heard of your heroics in battle. I always knew you would make good. High praise indeed from the mighty Hercules. Your reputation grows. My travels are certainly worthy of praise. Just the beginning, let me tell you. In fact you must already be famous just for having befriended me as a child. I suppose... I told Athena if she wishes my presence here to train a new generation of warriors, so be it. I mean after all who couldn't use advice from the mighty Hercules? Who indeed? Come inside, have some drink before your education starts. Pronax. Capaneous. I'm glad you came. You summoned me. It's not everyday one is called to the warrior's retreat. Though I'm confused as to why? My abilities on the battlefield and in the ring speak for themselves. I have no equal. That may well be, but this is a unique opportunity. One I didn't think you would mind indulging. I respect your accomplishments. I wouldn't have bothered traveling here if I didn't. Athena is here. So I heard. That can't be the only reason. Hercules is here. Hercules... So I might actually get to spar with the 'mighty' one himself? Indeed. You have done me a service, Pronax. I thought you might be pleased. Very. We will start on the training grounds at sunrise, I will sleep well then. Have the warrior's you championed arrived? Yes. The final one just arrived. Yes. The final one just arrived. It is a small compliment, but they will most certainly be kept busy. I sought out fighters who would challenge each other in many different ways. Good. I don't want any of them, Hercules especially, finding out the true purpose of this ruse. Hera's treachery must not find purchase here. Of course. Good. Then, I will check in on you and your men at daylight. Everything will go as planned. I'm sure of it. I hope so. I summoned here today for one Reason because you are the very best. War is my profession and as such, I make it my concern to know who I want fighting by my side. Thanks to Athena's patronage, you've been given an opportunity to further your training. Take a look around, one of these men may one day. save your life.. Let's begin. Haha I don't care.. Stop this there will be plenty more sparring... Hercules wishes to test his metal. Oh I have nothing to test. No mortal is my equal. In case you hadn't heard. Back away. Should we stop them, Pronax? No. Let them release their aggression... for a moment. You cannot win. I will... Alright, You won't. The sooner you are aware of that fact, the better. I'll show the rest of you what I know after we eat. I'm actually thirsty. Not bad. Should we go after him? Not if we wish to walk back with all our limbs intact. Capaneous will need to curb his anger, or it will consume him. Must you antagonize everyone? I assume you've been watching me? Your performance makes for excellent theatre. Do I sense you disapprove? I want you to take this seriously.You seem to think being born of the Gods makes you immortal. You seem to forget, I am as close to immortal as a man can be. Fear not, Athena, nothing can touch me. Oh, how wrong you are Hercules. Capaneous... Who is there? It is I, Hera... What trickery is this? Do you not wish to rid yourself Of Hercules? Did he not embarrass you, rob you of your well earned manhood? Yes. You are a champion. A mortal champion, your talents were hard fought. Hercules is but a plaything of Zeus. Ha, Bold words, from a bold man. But if you wish Hercules dead, you will have to do it properly. And you will need the proper ingredients. How do you mean? Just listen, my human champion and be quick about it. Mighty Zeus, I have tried reason, but other measures must be taken if Hercules is made to be aware of the dangers that constantly swirl around him. I wish only the best for my son, Athena. Hercules is vain, proud. He must find some measure of humility, or he will never even be aware of the dangers around him, and all his skills will be for naught. I trust you to teach him. Well there is a potion of herbs I can concoct, that may lessen his youthful hubris, at least I hope. I must try everything to protect him from Hera, and from himself, as is your will.. Do what you will. But know this, if anything happens to Hercules under your care, I will hold you responsible. And my punishment will be most severe. Yes, Zeus. Hera, my heart and mind are yours, clever Goddess. Did you enjoy the food? Ohh, Yes.. The servants here are good, I'm actually starting to enjoying my time here. Try this tea. It is full of herbal extracts... I hope it may relax you and perhaps open your mind. Since when did you become a seer, Athena? And yet you always have a remedy for some malady that does not exist. But I will humor you yet again. I simply want you to Understand what you are up against. You must be free of your pride. My pride serves me well. Regardless, I will host a dinner for you and the others tonight. I would not miss it. I can't speak for the others warriors. Enjoy your rest. I hope we might talk again later. Of course. Thank you.. Has Capaneous arrived? Yes, He has. He seemed more contrite than I would have guessed. I'm hosting a meal later, To officially welcome everyone. Please tell the men. Of course. Will the training be the same tomorrow? Yes. You are a good man, Pronax. You will teach them well... ...So the entire food cart is upended, gold scattered everywhere, but because of the sorry state of the donkey, no one went near it. Are you feeling well, Hercules? I am fine. Perhaps you have over indulged? Perhaps. I will be ready tomorrow. Good night. You seem content.. Oh, I am, Pronax. You have quite the way with words Thestor. Too bad your skills in battle don't quite match. It will be a longer day of training tomorrow. I recommend you take your leave. I look forward to your competitive spirits taking hold in the morning. Thank you, Pronax.I look forward to the competition.. For its own sake. Indeed... A competition for the sake of competition.... A Competition for the glory of it. And for the glory of the Gods... sounds promising. I encourage you to continue with the idea, Thank you... I will. Good night. I am out of sorts... I seem to have felt this injury all day... It is fine Hercules. Rest up. See how you feel when we start sword training later. Thanks.. It seems Hercules is only 'mighty' when it suits him. I wonder if he is the same in the bed chamber? Convenient you can speak to the man behind his back. are you his protector? Or his pet? Stop this , Save it for sword training. You will regret wasting your energy. You would be wise not to challenge me or my honor. This is most unbecoming of our station. True, but perhaps then you can be the partner of Capaneous in sword training. I was looking for you. How are you feeling? Fine... You are anything but. You were never a good liar, even when we were boys. Abderus... I... have lost my power. Perhaps you are sick? Or perhaps if you go to a seer? No. I simply do not have the strength and power I always had... I mean I have mortal strength, but... Who wants to compete against the sad weakness of us mortals? That is not what I meant. You could have fooled me. I know I have not bin best of friends to you Abderus.. but I am simply just ... Scared? Human. And apparently. I'm subject to the same frailties I do not like it, Abderus... I am not myself... I know you have every right to mock me but... I would not do that. You are not well, and no matter your temperament, It does not please me. Now what will you do? I will... hope. But for now please... let me be. I am not good company... nor have I bin.. I know all of you are familiar with hand and hand Combat im sure you utilize your skills in battle. As such, I'm looking to go beyond basic drills. I want to see you utilize the skills you do have and add new ones. Always keep a eye out for a vulnerable point, an Injury you can capitalize on. Trust me They will be looking to find your weakness as well. Capaneous, Abderus... Abderus, please... Abderus. Your master calls you, Perhaps you should go to him? I need no man's help to beat you. Stop this.. No It was an accident... Stop this madness.. You tried to kill my friend... I did no such thing... He attacked me.. He was the aggressor You saw him, you all saw him.. Stand down to me Hercules... stand down or fight me in a battle of honor. It is my right, is it not Pronax? It is your right, Capaneous. But... Then it is. Yield to me. Yield to me or fight me. I will fight you... at any time or place.. If you are not here, Tomorrow morning at sunrise. I will take it as your coward. I have erred in my judgment In bringing him here. I am sorry Hercules. Let me speak to him... No, Just let me go. How is Abderus? His ribs are clearly cracked.. But his breathing appears normal. He will need much time to heal . Hera... it is done, as you said... Of course it is. But we Must ensure your victory and Hercules demise. Victory is ensured... I can kill him without any help... Do not be foolish, you will do as I say. You will prepare another mixture and coat your sword in it. One touch will finish him. But you don't understand I can ... No. I am telling you to do as I say or face my wrath. Athena, what do you wish to discuss... Your powers are gone. How did you know? Hera gave you a potion... When? In the tea I made for you. Capaneous snuck in my chamber and put it there. At Hera's bidding. This is all my fault. You warned me to the dangers, but I chose to ignore all the signs. And now my best friend is wounded and I face my doom tomorrow. No. You may have lost your powers, but you are still a strong, and capable man. You have it in you to defeat him. I am but a shell without my gifts. Don't you see, you are so much more than your powers. That is what I've been trying to teach you all along. It's your heart and mind that dictate your success. Without my powers i am nothing. Then you will perish . And I along with you. How do you mean? Zeus instructed me to protect you. He made it clear, if anything should happen to you, my fate would be sealed. But that is not fair. But life is not fair Hercules. Not for you, not for me. Either use the powers you have always had to defeat Capaneous, or we both will perish for naught. What do I do? There is one thing that may be in your favor... but you must decide how best to use it. Hercules... I'm glad you came. Abderus, I'm so sorry, for getting you in such a state. I didn't mean for you to fight my battles. That is what friends do. And I will survive. But you must do one thing for me. What is it? If I can, I will. Beat him. I'm not sure if I can. I've bin poisoned at Hera's request. I may never regain my Gods given strength. It doesn't matter. You can beat him without it. I'm not so sure... I am. Capaneous is as we speak looking to coat his sword in a deadly poison. Even better. Now listen to me, so I may tell you a strategy that will work... Where is Hercules? I am here. I didn't think you would show. I fear no man... Or should I say the puppet of a woman. Are you sure you both wish to continue? Yes. Hurry up. Capaneous has brought his own sword, as is his right. Do you wish to choose your weapon, Hercules? These are both sturdy and true. Thank you, Thestor. The fight will continue until one concedes.. No concessions. No concessions. So it is asked, so it is given. Begin... Why don't you fight like a man?! Because there is a woman behind you. Of course if you wish to fight me like a man. What are you doing? HERCULES!?? Your fame will no doubt rise if you defeat the mighty Hercules by hand.. Unless of course you wish to be nothing more than a villain! Stop delaying your own death... I am better than you! Your beliefs will aid in your demise.. You are a spoiled child and an impotent puppet. What have you done? Hera's poisons work well huh... I guess I should know. You will not beat me... What happened? Be careful. His sword is poisoned. How did you know? Its not important. Excuse me. We have just witnessed the mighty Hercules without his might fight to victory. This will be a tale to be told for the ages. I knew you would be victorious. I couldn't have done it without your counsel... Or your friendship thank you. I will not disrespect either again. I must go see Athena, then I will return. Please do. Pronax has an idea For a games competition to honor the Gods of Olympus. He needs help putting it together. Sounds like a fine idea. I look forward to participating in that. I should have never doubted your wisdom, Athena. I am sorry for all that has happened. Do not be sorry. What I learned was valuable And even if my power do not return, I know I will be fine. I do not believe Hera's powers can keep you from accomplishing anything you set your mind to. As long as I have counselors Such as you and Abderus, I Know there is nothing I can't overcome, because I could not have done it without you both. Now, with your approval, I would like to stay and continue the warrior training. I feel like I have allot to learn. And I hear the others have devised some sort of competition for Olympus... Very good, Hercules. I'll tell Pronax and the others. Hercules recovered his full powers by the end of the training. Of course Hera's treachery was not sated, and the coming years would bring Hercules woe and strife to weigh down the most powerful of men. But that is a story for another time.
