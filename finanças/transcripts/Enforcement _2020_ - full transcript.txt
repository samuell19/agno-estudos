Release me now! - I can not breathe! - Hold his fucking legs! Lie still! Lie still! - I can not breathe! - Lie still! 15 arrested after yesterday's protests. The unrest comes in the wake of the arrest of Talib Ben Hassi who was admitted to intensive care on Wednesday ... P14, we fly over SvalegÃ¥rden. No major assemblies. The deputy police inspector believes that the situation is normalizing. We are present in the area. We believe that we have the young people under control. Ben Hassi was arrested after a car chase with police in a stolen car and was later transferred to the hospital. His condition is described as critical. - Okay? - Yes Yes. Fine. - Hi. So what? - So what? So, Poulsen ... Hey. - Is it broken again? - Yes. - Cheap shit. Are you up for grabs? - Yes, it was probably just a virus. Marianne has also been ill at home. You have not signed up for driving teams? - No, I would write on my cases. - I want everyone on wheels. And by the way ... I want you to ride with Mike Andersen. I need someone to keep him on a tight leash until this is over. The police appeals authority has chimed me down. They need to talk to everyone who was on duty that night. - I'll call them. - It is well. And my door is always open if you need to talk about anything. - Thanks. - See you in a little while. Give. - Good morning. - Morning. - Here you go. - Oh thank you. You have to drive with Mike Andersen. So better blow the brain out on myself. Why don't they just take his sign? - Like with Kofoed and Poulsen. - They're back in a week. - Do you think so? - These are two professional witnesses. And there is no one to say them against. You were actually on duty that night too, weren't you? - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you for coming on your day off. We've had a lot of trouble because of the situation with Talib Ben Hassi. His condition is stable, but if it changes, the unrest will increase. So that's our primary focus. Ben Hassi comes from SvalegÃ¥rden. So you stay away from the area unless you have to solve a specific task. Our presence can escalate the conflict. Questions? - Mills? - Where are Kofoed and Poulsen? Forced leave until it is decided whether to bring charges. This is normal procedure and I naturally expect an acquittal. - What about time off? - Only overtime is paid. - Our children will soon not remember us. - In your case, it does not do much. - I have something for you. - Nice finger. Please just shut up! You are very excited, but I will do what I can to make it better. And remember ... We are the people's protection against total chaos so let's restore peace and order before anyone doubts it. You set the agenda. Good guard. And take good care of each other out there. Enjoy. It's going to be a long day. Then it's eight hours with him the goggles. - I'm worried about his taste in music. - Such a little delicious cop rock. It's Volbeat in full swing. I'll give a late night spill if there's anything you need to talk about. If I survive that long. - Good guard, RÃ¸nning. - Enjoy. There he was. Ready to drive? - Yup. - It is well. 'Women with big butts have wiser children.' Aha. Then it's good that I had children with my ex. - Do you have children? - Not yet. - Are you married? - Yes. - But no ring on the finger? - Not during working hours. Do you remember when Laursen's ring got stuck in a fence during an aftermath? - The skin was peeled off like a banana. - It was not so good. No. Is that why you're not wearing it? Or are you fucking around? What'? I take that as a yes. Here is P14 with a broadcast. After a stone's throw against a colleague we are looking for a perpetrator. Male 15-20 years, 175 cm, brown in skin. Is it RÃ¸nning? - Do you lie and save a little in RÃ¸nning? - I was her supervisor. That makes it even naughtier. Such a little teacher-student action. Handcuffs and stick down in detention. Cheap shit, man. Relax now, HÃ¸yer. I'm just pissing on you. Couldn't they do the shit properly? The independent police appeals authority has launched an investigation to determine about two officers used unnecessary force as they pacified Talib Ben Hassi. Fucking witch hunt, man. It was he who made outbursts against them. He's a real lokum. Of course, they laid down on him. We had done that too. And then a cock head at a desk has to assess whether it's right. He was blowing through the city at 200 per hour. It is a miracle that no one died. Nobody says anything about that. Imagine if he had hit a small child. - Shall we hear something else? - The one behind the wheel has the radio. You are brave. Then you are also in charge of the entertainment. You have not said two words all morning, and I'm bored to hell. - Now you tell me a story. - What do you want to hear? What is your biggest fuck-up at work. - I have not made a single one. - Please just shut up. Everyone has done something. So what? Come on. Out with it. So what? Come on. I was an intern at Vestegnen. I was asked to go down to the basement and pick up a box of CS grenades. And? As I lift the box, the split smokes out on one of the grenades. - Shit. What did you do? - I threw the damn box and ran. I just manage to slam the door and then I hear the biggest bang. - And one more. And one more. - Did they all run? Fuck! - The depot must be explosion-proof? - Yes Yes. The door was reinforced and the walls were two meters thick. I just thought it was on cleanup and quack beers. Then I hear the fire alarm go off. People are rolling around and the gas has spread in the building. How stupid is that, man. - It was not the worst. - Is there more? It took half an hour before anyone thought of the Roma in detention. Shut up... So they sat and coughed and vomited? Shut up... And... Fuck them, man. Fucking gypsies. Does not? Then they can fucking learn it. - Shall we drive? - Yes. Fucking gypsies, man. They thought they could get a free night with food and porn. They commit their crime before noon. 19. Otherwise they fail to get dinner. A gypsy who steals in Brugsen costs the state treasury 50,000 kroner. But you need a holder for your block you must send an application in triplicate ... P14, inquiry in EK. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05 to EK, come. P14 to EK on Bravo Mike 79757. I repeat: BM 79757. Romeo 14-05, shifts. - So what? - It's just a gut feeling. Romeo 14-05, Bravo Mike 79757. Unknown Mercedes E-Class belonging to Hamza Alfarsi, came. - P14, received. Romeo 14-05, shifts. - It's Ottoman's car. - Did you see that? - Yes. They have mocked us. Make sure they do not throw anything out the window. They drive towards SvalegÃ¥rden. Shouldn't we stay away? There is a minor in the back seat. - So what, Mike? - Turn down that shit. Jump out of the car both of you. - What are you feeding him there? - That guy? Potatoes. - Only potatoes? - Yes. - What happened to the gangster trainee? - You're the only gangster here, boss. - What was he doing in your car? - It's my cousin. What is it with you boys and perfume? You stink like a brothel. Or is it your mother I can smell? What? I'm saying this for the last time. Stay away from the little ones. Are you following? You stay right there. Stay there. Of course. It is well. Damn good. Then pee with you. Romeo 14-05, we can see that you are staying in SvalegÃ¥rden, come. P14, we follow up on a vehicle. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05, received. Finish and get out. End. - When do you have to give an explanation? - I do not know. I've tried it. Tell me if there is anything you want to reverse. - Thanks. - You are welcome. Sami, come on. I can figure it out. Iza, we've talked about it. You're not old enough. - I want to be big brother, Sami. - You're not old enough. Do you want to help? Start by cleaning up. Then we'll talk about that later. Okay? Beware. - You have your hands full. - Yes. He wants to be big brother. - Is not it up to the parents? - Not such a big brother. Big brothers patrol in the evenings to create security. - I did not think you would come. - Have you called? Is the old man getting a little fat? Who the hell wrote that shit? - Hello! Is there anyone at home? - Why are you asking me? - You're a hard nail. - Just like you. - Danjiel and Iza, get some fresh air. - Yallah, come on. I do not understand that you bother. They get in the head and ass, and then they smash all the shit. - Maybe it's to be heard. - Such! Forward with the victim card. There are no victims here. We take responsibility for our actions. Like when you were sitting in the back of my patrol car? - Anything else? - Osman walked around with a boy. - He's recruiting them in front of your door. - I'll probably get to grips with him. - We have to. - Then you must be here a little more often. Sami! Sami! Hurry outside! Hey! Hey. What happens here? She's trying to make us sound like stupid perkers. I asked what you think about what has happened to the Taliban. You want trouble to happen so people can watch your mentally retarded TV. - You tried to give me money! - Feel free to give me some money. - It is not fun! - We need to clean up. Off. - Can I ask you some questions? - No. Are you sweet to go? Are there teams in the charges against the officers who arrested Ben Hassi? You have to contact the press officer, okay? Thanks. The arrest is described as an assault. What are your comments? - Did you try to bribe them? - It is normal to pay experts. They have not even got hair on the dick. What should they be experts in? - You only want to make amber in it. - Is not that also what you do? You have two minutes to pack your shit and leave the area. - Make room. - Make room ... - There is freedom of the press in Denmark. - Look around. This is not Denmark. Repeat this while looking into the camera. If I see you again, you will be arrested. Is that understood? - And and. - Yes. Shut up a cock head. Come right here. - What? - Come right here. - Let go now. - It is okay. What was it you said? - That there is freedom of the press ... - What did you say? That does not work. Come on. It does not work. - What now? - Nothing. Fucking mÃ¸gso. We put on this slider so people can sleep safely at night. We have to show who decides. Otherwise, we will not be able to enter without the entire northern flank of NATO behind us. One has to be over them all the time. They are young. Did you never do any shit? For that I did eddermame. Yes of course. But you became a policeman. They become drug dealers and violent criminals. First you get your finger. Then you get spit on. One day you get a gun in your face. Have you tried it ?! - Have you? - No. I have. It's something that changes your perspective. When you've been doing this for as long as I do, you'll agree with me. Yes. OK. And. Okay. What the hell are you staring at, you idiot? Do you have an ID? Name? Date of birth? - Amos Al-Shami. 070602. - And the last four? - I do not have to give them to you. - Do you have anything to hide? No. Where's your number? - You must be able to see your number. - You can have mine. - Why are you stopping me? - I have to ask you not to film. - I feel good in the public space. - Not if it interferes with our work. - You stop me for no reason. - Listen, Amos. You are charged with violating the Firearms Act. - On what basis? - Now I'm just visiting you. - You do not have legal authority to do so. - Then keep up some nice words you can. Now you just close your ass. Otherwise you will arrive at the station. I do not think you want to. Or what? This is an illegal visitation. Do you have anything in my pockets that I can stick on? Take off jacket, shoes and socks. Do you just keep a plus on them? Now look to get started, right? Come on, damn it. We do not have all day, right? - Are we about to be there? - No. Not quite. We just need to check on the underlings. Get rid of the pants. Get rid of the pants! Come now! Of! - What the fuck are you doing, man ?! - What are you doing?! No ... There's not much to see, huh? Are you standing and eyeballing me, you little puppy? What? Do you want to hit me? What? You little... So we were probably about to be there, huh? And. Now we are. Is there anything you want to say? Fine. Hey! Stop. - Let me go, man! - Stand still! Are you going to throw things at the police, you little perker? - Where are your friends? - I have not done anything! - Why did you run? - You're chasing me! - What are we doing? - Tell us where they are. Here is P14. Talib Ben Hassi has died as a result of his injuries why we expect increased activity in our focus areas. We call for sharpening of attention. No receipt. End. This is how it goes when ... Colleague in trouble! Colleague in trouble! Ned! - Romeo 14-05, where are you? Came. - P14, we get stones in SvalegÃ¥rden. - Romeo 14-05, shifts. - Romeo 14-05 states that they get stones. P14, we drive ... Romeo 14-05, com. Come on, come on, come on! Move! Fucking perk! - What the fuck is going on? - It's the police. Re-enter. Go in again! Just follow this one. Hey, hey, hey! Just follow this one. - Do you have pain anywhere? - No. P14, alarm signal. Bravo 14-13, shifts. Bravo 14-13 with alarm signal, come. P14, we have been met with a shotgun on Cikadevej. About ten young people. We are driven from the place and are out of the fight. 14-13, shifts. Bravo 14-13, drive to Station Syd and change vehicles. End. P14, we have been surprised by a larger grouping. Forward! Forward! Get loose! They have surrounded us! Golf 14-01, shifts. Golf 14-01, we'll get something out for you. No receipt. End. P14, alarm signal. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05 with alarm signal, come. P14, we have sought refuge in an entrance to ... - Kernebiddevej. - Kernebiddevej. The vehicle has crashed and we need help. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05 has been stoned and has left the vehicle. Received. Romeo 14-05, I currently have nothing to send to you. Inform a collection point outside SvalegÃ¥rden, come. They will not drive in here. They will fucking not run in here. Shut up... Fuck. You just stay there. Here. I think it's your size. - We have to let him go ... - We'll take him with us. He knows where the little satans are. - How do we get out of here? - Why should I tell you? - Listen, you know your rights. - You have to. You can receive compensation for an unjustified arrest. There is no one who believes in me. You can call me as a witness. So ... how much do I get in compensation? Where do we come out? - There. - And where are we? Of the. - P14, message. Romeo 14-05, shifts. - Romeo 14-05, com. P14, we are looking towards the parking lot at Tornskadevej. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05, received. End. Stop! Stop it...! Stop! Stop! Stop! I said stop! - Stop it! - Hey! - Stop! - Hey! Put that shit in there! Put it! - Stop! - Go into that fucking kiosk! I have it. The police! Put your weapon away! Put that shit down! Put it now! Lie down! There you were lucky, clammy Turks. I had plucked you in the fat belly. So what, HÃ¸yer? Do you have it under control? Hey, come in here! Come in here! Hurry up! Come in here! Hurry up! They're from the police. It was time for them, man. - You're going home. Here is not safe. - I have to take care of my shop. - It's the job of the police. - They want to fuck you ... - Mind your own business. - Gu I do not want. Take care of your work. It's not you who lives here. The perks terrorize everything and everyone. I have known Samir and Nadia for over 20 years. Now they have to close the store because no one dares to shop here. - The forces can not ... - Hey! Shut up. They come every day. They steal and threaten my customers. When I call the police, nothing happens. Why do you do that? Why do you have no respect? What are you laughing at? What do you get out of it? Then the party stops. Come here. - You just make friends everywhere. - Yes. Are you envious? After the death of Talib Ben Hassi. He was kept artificially alive but today the relatives have chosen to turn off the respirator. The death has created anger among young immigrants and at least 23 have been arrested after clashes with police. My mom said I should give you this. On social media, the events arouse resentment. 'My heart bleeds for Ben Hassi,' writes Frederikke Dam KjÃ¦r who calls his death a stain that can never be washed clean. What have you done? Plapped a guy who played smart. I am joking. I have not done anything. The armor just gets bored. Hey. - Are you okay? - Yes Yes. The two of us have probably gotten a little skewed towards each other, HÃ¸yer. That was actually why Hedegaard and I agreed that we should drive together. - People talk. - Now? What do people say? You give explanation as the last. You seem unsure of what you want to say. Then people get nervous. People do something stupid when they are nervous. - Are you threatening me? - No no. No not at all. We just need to know if we can count on you. Kofoed and Poulsen are not the stiffest dicks in the sauna. What they did was stupid, and they know it. It went too far. They had a split second to respond and then they made a mistake. Because they were scared. See how fast it went before you even lost control. They do not deserve to have their lives ruined. What about Talib Ben Hassi? What about his life? We have to take care of each other. Otherwise we will not survive. Who knows ... Maybe it's you who needs help next time. - I'll probably shut up. - No. Tell them what happened. You were not there. You wrote a report or emptied the dishwasher or tear it off outside on the toilet. I'm pissed off. You saw nothing. Do we agree? What's going on out here? Who sent it? I do not know. - What are you doing? - He's got it too. - Everyone got it. - What if they come here? - Nothing's happening to you. - It's better if you go. That's what she's trying to say. Where have I seen you before? Have you played ball in the Police Youth Club? My friend was coaching there for a while. You were the star player. That guy? I could play circles around you. You can 't even catch me. Now you also do not have a shattered meniscus and cruciate ligament injuries in both your knees. What? Then you're safe with Arsenal. All brown boys love Arsenal. - Armor loves Real Madrid. - Who is your best player? Ã–zil? - He just sits and scratches his ass. - He's better than Benzema. You're just saying that because we stole him right in front of you. Benzema has won everything. Arsenal players are bitches. - They do not do the dirty work. - Real Madrid buys whore players. But those are the hardcore super prostitutes. First Ronaldo, and now we have Hazard. So why don't you play anymore? - Your buddy threw me out. - Why? - What have you done? - Nothing. That is clear. You are the innocence yourself. Someone named Rasmus provoked me. I said we could meet after training if he had a problem. It's damn stupid to hit each other too. He did not come. But he said I threatened him with a knife. - Did you have it? - Why do not you start somewhere else? Fuck it there. It is a waste of time. Romeo 14-05, Charlie 14-02 is on Tornskadevej in five minutes, come. Do you think they are? P14, message. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05, com. P14, can Charlie 14-02 flash the lights? Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05 is at the contact point. Charlie 14-02, are you just blinking once? P14, of course. Charlie 14-02, switch. Mills, this is the first time I'm glad to hear your voice. Romeo 14-05, someone has to save your ass ... Your fucking dog! Do you think you can run away? We're killing you! And your family! P14, Charlie 14-02 was met with firebombs and has fled. Tornskadevej is blocked off. We can not get out. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05, I have nothing to send to you, come. P14, what do you mean? What the hell are we going to do then? Romeo 14-05 ... it is ... It is your discretion. No receipt. Final. - Are you okay? - I can not feel my hands. They just sleep. - Where do you live? - Solriksvej 37. At 14. Is it far away? We're not coming out right now, and he lives pretty close. Maybe we should go to his house. Do you want to hide with him? - Yes. - No. - Do you want to shoot yourself? - We'll find another way. - There is no other way. - He's not going anywhere. - This is your fault. - You could have just stopped me. And Kofoed and Poulsen. You were there. But ... you did not shit. Well? Get up and come. Came. We have to go. Are you moving? - Drop that shit. - You're a fucking twist in the grass, HÃ¸yer. Fine. Are you moving now? Would you rather hold your hand over the jackals or your own colleagues? You can believe it. I'm telling everyone what happened to Ben Hassi. You're not doing shit, you little cotton dick. Otherwise, you will experience how alone you are. Fuck you. And fuck your friends. Where the hell are you going ?! What?! Are you done? What? Keep your eyes peeled! - I can not see, man! - Do not rub in it. - Breathe. - It hurts! Yes. Breathe. - Is this where you live? - No Yes. - Is there a back entrance? - No. What the fuck are you doing ?! - What's up, you little whore? - Fuck you! - Can you get away ?! - You fucking bums, man! Are you stupid or what? Fuck you! Hello, what's going on ?! Hello! What is it? Nothing! I said you should stay away! Fucking perk! No... Do not want to ... - Can we go somewhere else? - No. Okay. We've come up with something else. What about him your colleague? Do you think he's okay? The most important thing is that we get you to safety. It was me who threw that milkshake. I know. But you throw like a bitch. What are you doing? You've lost quite a lot of blood. You have to sit down. My name is Abia. I'm a nurse. The bleeding has stopped. I've given you salt water ... Hi. What's your name? Is it a secret? Okay. How old are you? 20? Okay. 37? Now I know. You are 89 years old. I'm actually five years old. Wow. It's like my boy. Did you see. Back to bed with you. - But it's noisy outside. - Then you must join me. Mom, who's that man? He is someone who has beaten himself up and needs help. But when will Amos come home? He is coming soon. - You have some food, um ... - Shit! - How are you feeling? - Much better, thank you. - Are these your children? - Uh ... yes. Amira, whom you met and ... This is Amos, my son. - Where is he? - I do not know. He should have been here by now. He's probably coming soon. - It's not going to be a big culinary ... - I'm not going to push myself. No, but you must have something to eat. Another picture that emerges. Both cars and containers are on fire and stones are thrown and fireworks are fired at the police. Hundreds have lit candles where Talib Ben Hassi was arrested. Talib Ben Hassi's mother spoke to us earlier today. Here she appealed to police and protesters to stop the riots. You must not fight because of the Taliban. The Taliban were not violent. He was a sweet and happy boy. He was a good brother and son. And now I will not see him again. You must not fight in his name. I do not want more parents to lose their children. More than 60 have been arrested and more than 30 protesters and officers are reported injured during the worst street fights in Denmark. Do you have children? And. My mom always said that being a parent is as if one's heart jumps out of the body and goes around unprotected. He's a good boy, Amos. He's just so angry all the time. I understand him well. No matter what he does, it's never good enough. If one is treated as something one is not then one ends up believing in it. But you probably know that. I'm sure your boy's fine. And... Are you going to shoot after us, you fucking gay? Do you want to die ?! Do you want to die ?! What?! You should not look at him! He can not help you! You're all alone, you fucking armor. There is no one to help you! Amos ... take his breath. Now take his fucking yawn, man! What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you up to, man ?! Piss off with you. Piss off with you, I say! Relax. Relax. Come on. Let him be. Let him be. Come now. Why do you have Amos' phone? - Where's my son? - He's with my colleague. He threw things at our car, so we had to arrest him. We tried to follow him home, but we were separated. I thought they were on their way here. Something must have happened. - Help! - Quietly! Be quiet. Be quiet. I'm not doing anything to you. I'm not doing anything to you. I'm not doing anything to you. Well? Look at me. Look at me. Abia? - I'll probably find Amos. - Abia? Just open the door. - You'll probably get him home. - Abia, just open the door. - Mother? - Abia? Are you okay? - Just open the door, Abia! - Abia! Abia, what's going on ?! Now kick the fucking door in. If you're behind the door, move! Go away. It's the police. Go away. - What the fuck is going on? - It is none of your business. - Where's Abia? Who's screaming? - It is none of your business! - Go into your apartment! - You must not rule over me! - Fuck you! - Move! Do not stand there and stare! It is nice! Fucking great. Get rid of you, you loser. Abia? Amira? Where are you? Abia? So what, Mike? - Enter. - You're out fucking, huh? Do you have shit in your ears? Go in with you! Not! That's not a real joke, man. Shall we find out? Shall we? Close the door. Close the door! Come on. Fuck. - We have to help him. - Believe it. It's a fucking armor. - Check out this guy, man. - Eow, it's not a toy! Relax now, man. It's not a real gun, that. - Did you not be told to stay home? - Who else would save you? - How did you find me? - It's not that hard. You will be watched. - My colleague, do you know where he is? - We can help find him. Why should you help me? If something happens to an armor in here, everything just gets a lot worse. Now go home with you. I can get a car! - You're driving rotten. - Shut up! Step on the clutch. It is located to the left of the brake. Release it while slowly gassing up. - Whose car is this? - My fathers. - Does he know you're driving in it? - No. He also does not care. - They've completely jipped it. Shut up, man. - P14, message. Romeo 14-05, shifts. - Romeo 14-05, com. P14, I'm still in SvalegÃ¥rden. Romeo 14-05, shifts. Romeo 14-05, received. You get a separate speech group. Switch to standby two, come on. Fuck. Throw a blanket over him. Hurry up. So what, boys? Are you out driving your father's car? - Have you seen the two armor? - No no. - And your friend? - He has not seen anyone. Can he not answer himself? What? Jump right out. - Out with you. - Me? Yes, who else? Come on, come on. Arrow off with you. - What is it? I'm busy. - Relax. We're just going to talk, right? What is that? What? Say if you need a real one. Don't tell Sami. He wants you to be a good perker, but that's not how you get respect. - You must also have self-respect. - Do I not have it? What? That big brother piss ... that does not mean shit. But we do. We need someone like you, Iza. You're not a child anymore, are you? - No. - Well. Well. So tell me... How the fuck is that armor her? Do not fucking play stupid. What the fuck are you looking at? Shoot! Come now! Wallah, how wild it was, man! You picked them all, man! - I owe your father a new car. - It was an old shit car after all. Here. It is for you. You can become a good cop. Highs, connection? Mike, switch. Highs, connection? Mike, switch. Just try to see. - Where is it? - I can show you where it is. Come on, man! Keep up! Come on come on! Come now! - They're there! Come on! - Wait a minute, Iza! It's the police! Show me your hands! Jens?! Jens? Jens. What happened? I do not know. What do you mean you do not know? He was just there all of a sudden. I thought it was one of them. I'm not going to jail, Mike. I can not. Mike... He made outfits to shoot. You acted in self-defense. Say it. Hey! Say it. - I acted in self-defense. - Yes. This has never happened. So. You lost it here. Where is Amos? Did he see it? And. You have to see to get away. Come now. Your mother is waiting ... Get going with you now. Do you want to end up like him up there? Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die? Now step with you, for hell! Off! Off! Texts: Danish Video Text
