[music playing] [dog barking] [door rattling] [dog barking] [glass breaking] [snip] [interposing voices] It's past your bedtime, so no clowning around. [interposing voices] Then you do too. OK, kiddos. Oh, Sara, can you just pick up your dollhouse before we have our cake? And Daniel, you come with me. All right? We'll get some milk and set the table. Mom, can we have some soda? Oh, no. I think it's better if you have milk for... for cake. Please. No, no. And I know you have milk? [dog barking] Daniel, come with me one minute. Mommy, what happened to the phone? I don't know what, honey? Sara. Wait a second. Ewa, please. Daddy! I've only come to see my children. I've been missing you so much. Come over there. Your little dollhouse, huh? Daddy fixed the door. It broke. (ANGRILY) You're going to listen to me, Ewa. You can't keep me away from my children. I haven't seen them for a long time. Could you bear that if it happened to you? [sirens] Tell me, Ewa. Why can't you answer me? [sirens] [voices on police radio] [knocking] - Are you OK? - Everything is all right. Might I have a moment with my children? Is it all right? Why is this happening? [dog barking] The medical center called you, right? Did they say I've escaped? Better safe than sorry, Adam. It won't work, you and your lawyer trying to keep me away. [yelling] [sirens] What did he yell in Polish as they were taking him away? That it is my fate to die. Not today. I think I'll just make us some coffee. What do you think? [music playing] [laughter] [wa-hoo] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Now after that wonderful dancing, I would like to present the new and distinguished president of the Polish Club, Adam Berwid. Come on, Adam. Come on! [applause] Well, [clears throat] if there's one thing all Polish people share, it's our patriotism. Loyalty, faith, trust we bring to America. Rich or poor, the Polish man give these things in return for opportunity and freedom... this and his love of home and family. With my wife Ewa at my side. [applause] [music playing] Look happy, Ewa. Smile. Look all these good people, Ewa. [applause] [music playing] [interposing voices] It would allow me to go back to work as an engineer. Why waste your time with Angus Rozhinska while I wait for you? I was just asking if she could babysit. Marsha is a good enough babysitter. But she can only work on weekends, Adam. You know that. We need someone the children can trust to be with them during the week. I told you I would provide. You don't need a job. Adam, please let me take it. There's nothing more to say. There's nothing more to talk about. Go to bed. I'll take my shower. You're still up? Are the children asleep? Daniel must have found his teddy bear, because I saw its head sticking out of the covers. Want to go to bed? Yes. [typing] Excuse me. Yeah. I'm here about the job interview. Right. They will be interviewing the secretaries right after lunch downstairs. Um, excuse me again. Yeah. Uh, it's... it's not the secretary job. It's the power engineering position. Sorry. Everybody's out to lunch. So Mr. Norton's down in the drafting room. I'll take you to him. Thank you. This is a very impressive work history. Why so long since your last job? Well, we defected from Poland. It was nine years ago. And then the children came along. So... Defected? That must have been exciting. Um, no. Actually, we just walked away. Come on. Really? Maybe I should make up a better story. Nah. I just read too many spy novels. What happened to your accent? Where did you lose it? Brooklyn. Brooklyn? That's where people go to get an accent. You know, you're not at all what I expected, Mrs. Berwid. Contributed to the plans for the 800 megawatt power plant. What aspect? The durability calculations of the main vessel on the piping layouts. Where is your husband? What's he up to? He's... he's a nuclear engineer. He started his own consulting firm. But he's... he's been having some difficulty. He may be forced to close his office. It's tough. Takes guts to start something like that, especially in a new country. You know Mrs. Berwid, you'd be the only lady engineer in the company. I don't know how things are in Poland, but around here the guys get very rough. I know my field, Mr. Norton. And I will do the job for you. It doesn't matter about anything else. I take two weeks a year, go to Las Vegas and lose my pants. Do you know that means? It means I like to gamble. Also means I'm a lousy gambler. Ah, but this is no gamble. Maggie, come on in here and meet the first lady engineer in our company. Well, it's about time. Saving, borrowing, taking a loan out on the house. And now a full time babysitter. For years I thought that you were spoiled... an only child. And so I tried to teach you. I tried to teach you how to keep a decent house, how to dress, how to take care for your own babies. Adam. Now I realize you were just pretending, binding me to you with the children, waiting for me to fail. Adam, please. You won't fail. It takes a long time to start a business. I see you struggling for all of us, and it hurts me too. Let me work just until we pay the debts... just until your company gets going. I know it will, Adam. You've always taken such good care of me. Now let me pay you back for all those years. Let me work, please. [click] Mr. Berwid. Thought you'd already be moved out of the office. Sorry, Jimmy. Can I help? Tell me. Me Have you ever seen my wife? Your wife? Well, yeah. I think so. She's very pretty. Mommy, is this what jellyfish are made of? No, dummy. jellyfish have insides without outsides. Right, Mom? You're a dummy, too. [interposing voices] EWA BERWID: We're going to go to the beach this Saturday. And Daddy may even take us to the park on Sunday if you're really good. I'll be real good. Hi, Dad. - Hi. Hi. Hello. Are you all right, hun? Of course. Why are you asking? I know it must have been hard to close the office. I just... Don't shame me in front of the children. Adam, I was... I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. What's this? Hot dogs. With ketchup and mustard. They've been begging for them all week. Junk food? So now you don't have time to make your children a proper meal so you can clean the cabinets like I told you? Adam, I have been at work all day. Of course. I forgot how your boss is working you every night. He is. And they want me to work full time. What shall I tell him? Shall I tell him no? Shall I quit? (YELLING) I'm not finished! Daddy! What are you doing, Adam? [interposing voices] Stop it! Stop it! Daddy, I'm hungry! I'm hungry. Go to your bed. Sara, come on! Not until your mother makes a proper meal. [yelling] I'm hungry! Sara, please. Stop this, Adam. Don't make the children suffer. Leave them or I'll beat the devil out of you. Children I... I promise we'll have more hot dogs. OK? Are you very hungry, you two? Yeah. Yeah, I know. What if I bring you some cereal a little later? Bananas? Yeah. Yeah. Bananas. Your favorite. (ANGRILY) I know what you're doing to them! I know what you're doing! [slam] Adam, stop. Don't hit me. Don't hit me, please. [smack] [ugh] [grunting] [moaning] No! No! (CRYING) Please. [ugh] Adam! [ugh] Adam! Stop! Please, stop! [grunt] [scream] [crying] (CRYING) No. Oh, no. No. No. [crying] If you ever disobey me again, I'll kill you. [slam] [crying] (READING) America was the first country in the world to give boys and girls a place of their own in a public library. The first children's room to be included in an architect's plan and equipped for the confident convenience of children from picture book to high school age were that of the Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn, New York, opened in 1896. [crying] Don't worry about a thing. You'll be in very good hands here. Believe me. It's the same as paying a high-priced lawyer. Good morning, Johnny. Most of these kids here are law students, Mrs. Berwid, at Larchmont. Excuse me, Bobby. Let's see. Well, you've gotten rape right, but hotline is one word. OK? Yeah. We have a blanket agreement with the district court allowing us to practice the simple aspects of the law. But we do it all here... matrimonial, custody. Janet Landry. Ewa Berwid. She'll be right with you. [phones ringing] [inaudible]. Yeah. OK. We'll see what we can do. I'm sorry. Have a seat. Um, Mrs. Berwid, is it? It's a madhouse here as usual. OK, you indicate that, uh, it's a matrimonial problem. I think so. Yes. Janet! Hm? Janet. Excuse me. Where the hell did I put that stuff that Solomon sent us? (MUMBLING) I don't know. I think Jeff's got it. Oh, this is Mrs. Berwid. Mrs. Berwid, Ben Haggarty. He's a law professor, but now he's as hassled as the rest of us. [crunch] Well, I guess that sums me up. Hello. OK. So now what can we do for you, Mrs. Berwid? It's about my husband. I think he's intending maybe to kill me. Oh. Yeah, I guess that's what it's supposed to feel like. You know, my cousin Lucy and her husband split up. But... maybe we should talk to Ben. He's, uh, real good with stuff like this. No remorse? None of that? Nothing? Hm? No. Now, Mrs. Berwid, you said that your husband's business has just folded. Sometimes people under a great amount of strain aren't themselves for awhile. Janet isn't trying to minimize the situation. It's just that there might be some mitigating factors that we... we can explore. That's all. Please, go on. Well, he, uh... with our children, for example, he's always very firm with them. It's not that he didn't love them, but it's almost as if now he's obsessed with them. He... he says that I neglect my daughter. And he watches me with Daniel. He's our son. And he... he accuses (CRYING) with my own babies. Angry people say some pretty mean things. But it's not just that. He's... he's like a stranger. (CRYING) He's full of hatred. And when he looks at me, it's like he sees someone who is going to destroy him. You're trying to tell us something. What is it? And I am afraid my husband is losing his mind. Has he been examined by a doctor? He won't go. He's always trusted me to help him. You have the right to decide when you've had enough, no matter what. These situations are complicated and very painful, Mrs. Berwid. Just want you to know that we're here to help you any time with anything, anywhere. Thank you. You're welcome. I... I just wanted to ask one thing before I go. What's that? Well, perhaps you don't handle such things, but I would like to ask someone about writing my will. Now 7 plus 2. 9? Right. Very good. Now 7 plus 8. - Um, 10? - No. That's [inaudible]. Um. Think about it. Sara, the fork is on the left. I know which is left. Of course you do, because you're a big girl, number one. Tell me, what do you have to do before lunch? Change clothes. Right. Where's your blue blouse? Mommy mended it. I think it's in her sewing cabinet. I'll go and get it for you. You keep playing. Now it's 15. Right. DANIEL: You're doing it wrong. You're supposed to do it on the right. SARA: I know what I'm doing. And it's supposed to go on the left. Just go back to [inaudible]. DANIEL: I don't want to go back to [inaudible]. You can't do that! You're cheating! No, I'm not, because we're playing my way. No, we're not! SARA: Yes, we are. DANIEL: Uh-uh. SARA: Yes, we are. Because we never said we were playing your way. So we must be playing my way. DANIEL: Uh-uh. Hey! That's cheating! Uh-uh! I hate you. Children, stop it! What are you doing? - He cheated. She cheated! - Where's your father? - He left. He got mad. He left you alone? He cut up your dress in the sewing room. Mm-hm. Yeah. Children, now, get your jackets. We're going out. - But what about dinner? We're going out for dinner. Come, Daniel, son. Why is Daddy being so mean? He's just very confused. Hurry, children. We're going to Maggie's. We'll eat there and stay the night. Ewa, why didn't you tell me all these things before? I mean, I knew something was wrong. But I just thought it was the standard macho. Maggie, we come from a country where all the decisions were made for us. Now everything confuses him. But I thought you said he was the one who wanted to come here. Come on, hun. Sit down. Yes, it was his dream to come to America. But the reality was very different. So now he sees everybody as his enemy. Even the woman next door. Don't talk to her, he told me. You're not allowed to do that. Ah, boy, I can't believe this. You sound like a prisoner. Does he ever take you out on weekends? In the afternoon sometimes we take the children to the park. And we used to go to the Polish Club, but then they said they were plotting against him. So... And now it's you. [sigh] You've got to see a lawyer. Yes. I saw one today. Good for you. Maggie, if I leave him he'll only get worse. I know it. Oh, gal, I have heard that song and dance a million times. It's a bunch of baloney. You gotta stop blaming yourself and tell him to take a hike. [phone ringing] Hold on. Hello. Hello? Jerk. Hung up. Maggie, I'd better go. You don't think that was him. Oh, Ewa, don't be silly. I don't want him coming here and getting you in trouble. Ewa... Ewa, he does not even know my last name. Now how's he going to get my number? Maggie, if Adam wants your number or your address or your grandfather's address, he will get it. I can't believe it. Hi. Hi, sweeties. (WHISPERING) Come, Sara. Daniel, wake up. Wake up. We're just going to go home. [mumbling] Mama, I'm tired. Why don't you stay here. I've got tons of room. Do what you have to do, and worry about the guilt later. Oh, Maggie, it's all right. Ewa, do you hear me? You have friends who care about you. I know it. It... it's no problem for me. I promise you. I... [knocking] It'd be easier for the... [knocking] Don't you worry. I'll take care of this. Come Sara. Then you can sleep in your own bed. MAGGIE: Who is it? ADAM BERWID: Adam Berwid. For my wife. Is she with you? Is she here? Mm-hm. May I come in? (YELLING) Ewa, it's Adam. He wanted to come in. Yes, Maggie. It's all right. Tell him we're just coming. (WHISPERING) Daniel, put your pants on right now. Thank you. Nice place. Adam, would you stop for a minute, please? I would like to talk. Sit down. I want to talk as well. Adam, things must change between us. I've been to see a lawyer. They suggested counseling. Not necessary. Not necessary? I agree with you. Things must change. So I've made some decisions. You are so easily deceived, Ewa, that maybe, for instance, you shouldn't waste your time with people like that. Adam, she's my... The children... they must eat proper food. And they have to stop running wild all day. Sara especially. It's not good for a girl to dress as a boy. You should make her new clothes. - Adam. What? Do you understand? We could be a happy family. Well, I've been aggressive and weak, but I'll find work. And tomorrow you'll quit your job. Do you agree, Ewa? Do you? I must leave you, Adam. I'm sorry. Good. So now you divorcing me. I'll take custody of the children. And you will be outside like you want me. Adam, we can't live in the same house anymore. JUDGE: Have the attorneys approach the bench. Gentlemen, please. This has to come to an end. Well, that's... that's exactly... that's precisely what I feel. That's why we're asking for minimal visitation rights. [interposing voices] JUDGE: You realize, Mr. Crowell, the way things are going that your client will end up in jail. DICK CROWELL: I understand that, Your Honor. And believe me, I want to avoid that. BEN HAGGARTY: And we agree absolutely. Something has to be done in this courtroom. Your Honor. And I apologize on behalf of my client. [interposing voices] What are you talking about? I want to know. Mr. Berwid, the court would like to remind you that you have already violated several protection orders. Are you trying to tell me when I can see my children? You will not see them at all if you do not respect the visitation rights established by law. I'm going to decide that. Let their biological mother go and be a businesswoman. Because the children would stay with me. I've planned fears for her physical safety, Your Honor. Mr. Berwid has broken into her house four times since we filed for divorce. Mr. Berwid, we have set your visitation rights for Sundays between 3:00 and 6:00 P.M. I'll see my children when I want to see them. And if I tell you that I'm going to put you in jail for 30 days, do you still intend to defy the order of this court? You're telling me to defy the order of this court. Do we have a language problem here? (ANGRILY) No, there's no problem. All the tricks you have put into our mind will never bring me to my knees! You're telling me not to see my children. And I tell you I have to be a man, and I'm going to save them whatever it costs. [sirens] EWA BERWID: Adam, you just can't come back whenever you want. ADAM BERWID: I have come for the children. You are going to obey me, Ewa. Do you understand, Ewa? [sirens] [voices on police radio] [knocking] [interposing voices] Who told you to come for me? We're getting tired of picking you up, Adam. It won't work. You and your lawyer are trying to keep me away. I guess they got here just in time. [speaking polish] [sirens] MAN (ON INTERCOM): Visitor waiting for Adam Berwid. Visitor waiting. [slam] Visitor waiting for Mark Johnson. Visitor waiting. Visitor waiting for Paul Slade. Visitor waiting. Now you break into the house seven times. And now you have two weeks of psychiatric observation. Better expect me to sleep. Don't worry. You'll be confined to the medical center during observation. Adam, this kind of behavior does not win custody cases. I will win custody. Listen to me. It takes extraordinary cause to take a kid away from its mother in this country. So far you haven't even given me a reason. She's evil. Yeah? Well, lots luck with that one, pal. I tell you. And I blame myself for this. I looked away. Looked away for too long. (CRYING) With my own son. What are you saying to me? (CRYING) Sleeping with him, stroking his naked body, sodomizing him. Do you know what that word means, Adam... sodomy? (CRYING) I got the Bible. I swear before God. I have to think about this. I will come and see you at the medical center. Now, look. You've been under a lot of strain, but you've got to cool off. You're not going to get anywhere by throwing around death threats. Do you catch my drift? Do me a favor and don't kill anybody. OK? [banging] I'll see you. [slam] [ugh] Maggie, can I have the towel? Are you ready to say uncle yet? No. I need the other wrench too. Considering the divorce rate, maybe we should all take plumbing. It's Saturday. What do you say we get a babysitter, get dressed to the teeth, and go confront the enemy tonight. Huh? Maggie, I thought that the battle of the sexes had left you shell-shocked. [laughs] Yeah, well, maybe I lost my marbles out on the battlefield, but I keep reenlisting. So you want to go? Oh, Maggie, I can't. I've got the kids. You have always got some excuse. DANIEL: Mommy, there's a man at the door. I'll get it. Be cool. You're divorced now. Adam's back in the jail again. You got nothing to worry about. Mommy, are you almost done? I'm almost done, Daniel. After you're done, can you come up and play with me? Yes, I can. And I want to very much. Just let me finish. Two minutes. Postman. Registered mail. It came yesterday afternoon from the jail. It's in Polish, so please forgive the translation. Sit down, please. (READING) Ewa Florian, count the hours of your life. I don't have to run away from jail to escape. When you get choked, it will be by my hands. By the time I put you to death, I'm going to push your ribs till they go to the other side of your body. I'm going to cut the veins in your legs and... and your teeth I will sh... shove into your brain. Your character is like the devil. You are pushing your luck too far. All these ideas that you come up with will... all these ideas that you come up with will come back to your mind in the last minute from my hands. Adam Z. Berwid. May I see that letter please? See the envelope please? [clears throat] Here. He mailed it as registered mail, huh? I can't read this. It's in Polish. It doesn't matter what language it's in. It's in the language of a maniac. And he's not kidding, is he? What can we do? Well, we'll charge him with aggravated harassment. Oh, come on. That's only a misdemeanor. He'll get a couple months at most. Well, then what should we do? Come on. You tell me. You're the A student. Well... You know this guy isn't kidding, right? Right. I mean, what if everybody who got ticked off and wrote a nasty letter got slapped in jail for the rest of his life? - OK, but... What happens to the First Amendment? Hm? Come on. Come on, Ben, look what we've got here. We got to think of something to do. Yeah. We are going to do something. You're going to go to the library. You're going to find me a precedent. But first you're going to bring me a sandwich because I'm starving. Go on. We'll do the best we can with what we've got. I think the letter will be enough, Ewa. You won't have to appear in court. Are you sure that this wasn't re-translated? I think so. [inaudible]. Now Adam. I want you to help me out. Try not to speak. Let he handle this. Adam, when I speak to you, do you hear me? It sounds like a Mickey Mouse thing. Stand up. Be seated. People of the state of New York versus Adam Berwid. Charges are aggravated harassment. Are there any preliminary motions? No, Your Honor. Proceed. Your Honor, I've come to a decision. Adam, for God's sake. What is it, Mr. Berwid. I know something you don't. I know my wife is a liar. Well, thank you, Mr. Berwid. Uh, there will be a time for you later on to let... Before God she lies under oath. She's destroying my children's lives. I know that. You don't. See fools you too like everybody else. And there will be a time for you to state your case, Mr. Berwid. Sit down, please. And I tell her now, I have no choice but to kill her. Mr. Berwid, do you realize the gravity of the statement you've just made? Your Honor, uh, my client is distraught. English is not his first language. Now I... - No. I'm fine. I'm saying I'd do anything to protect my children. If Judge Goldberg is a father he understands. He knows his duty. My duty, sir, is to protect society from those who threaten its members with violence. That's why I trust God, not you. My wife knows what I'll do. Defendant Adam Berwid is hereby remanded, pursuant to section 703.30 of the criminal procedure law to determine the competency of defendant to stand trial. Congratulations. Ewa, how are you? You sure you're ready for this? Where's Janet? She's inside. Now you wait outside the courtroom until you're called to testify. Then you go right to the witness box. OK? You understand that? All right. You're not the only witness. Others will be called too. Just be calm. Answer frankly and factly. If you get nervous, just look at me. Let the record reflect that this is a hearing regarding Adam Berwid's competency to stand trial on the charge of aggravated harassment. Please have Mrs. Berwid take the stand. You evil woman. JUDGE: Mr. Berwid. And you taught me! Sit down, Mr. Berwid! You take my children and all I own and put me in jails and mental hospitals. JUDGE: I'm warning you, sir. ADAM BERWID: All to tell me my duty what I must do! JUDGE: Sit down, Mr. Berwid! [inaudible] to help you [inaudible] help me. [gavel knocking] JUDGE: (YELLING) Officer, sit that man down! Mrs. Berwid, you may leave. ADAM BERWID: They help to teach me. They teach me. [yelling] [gavel knocking] (SCREAMING) Ewa! Ewa, I'll kill you! I will kill you! Ewa! [screaming] [grunting] On the basis of psychiatric reports and Mr Berwid's behavior in this court, I find defendant Adam Berwid incompetent to stand trial, and commit him to 60 days observation at the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Hospital. Let the record reflect that I will take any legal precaution at my disposal to make certain you are not a threat to Ewa Berwid. JUDGE: This is not a prison, Mr. Berwid. It's a maximum security hospital. Aside from the ward physician, your treatment team consists of Mrs. Johnson, one of the psychologists, a social worker, and a time assistant. There's also a nurse. Mr. Olson, the lawyer, is also provided, should you require his services. Any questions? ADAM BERWID: When do I get out? JUDGE: That's really up to you, Mr. Berwid. [hammering] Well, that should do it. What do you think? Let me see. [grunt] I don't know. Ewa, we both know that sooner or later, Adam will come back here. He's only been found incompetent to stand trial for a misdemeanor. That's nothing. It's 60 days. SARA: Mommy, Daniel wants to know if we can have more ice cream before bed. DANIEL: You said it first. - One second. SARA: I did not. I bought these new shoes. Well, they're not new exactly. I got them at a bargain store. But I think they're very modern. Ewa, why don't you move to another city? And just change your name, and just disappear. No. For many reasons. I have no money. There's a lien on the house for business debt, so I can't sell. Anyway, he'd find me. Where are you going to hide a female Polish engineer with two children? Ewa, the man is dangerous. When he gets out, where do you think he's going to go? Janet, please. How can I run when I can't even stand on my own feet? It is very easy. You just pack your bags. It is not easy. Everything and everyone I know is here. I've never been on my own before this. But I have a good change here. Oh, Ewa, you have a good chance anywhere. Come on. You're bright. You're talented. But here first, please. I loved Adam once. It shouldn't be like this. It's just that I'm worried about you. I served in the Polish Army. I can use a gun. I've applied for a permit. Might as well take Karate while you're at it. At some point I have to trust God. God doesn't have anything to do with this. We'll see. [interposing voices] Bam! Bam! On the way, the FBI gets its man. FBI runs the show. Want to know who put you here? FBI. FBI? They're everywhere. Be careful who you talk to. They send out thoughts. Keep your thoughts to yourself. Come on, G-Man, pill time. Come on. It's all right. You too, Adam. No. No pill. Don't pull this again. No pill. (YELLING) Mommy. Mommy! What is it, Daniel? Are there any tigers here? I don't think so. Why? Sara said so. I said there used to be mountain lions here. Mrs. Watson said so. Oh. Well, I think maybe your sister is right then. Now could you two stop squabbling and go to sleep? Mommy, is Daddy ever going to come home? I don't know, Daniel. I think he's going to be in the hospital for a long, long time. Can you sleep now? Huh? OK. Well, this could be a butterfly. See? This is it's wing. It Only has one wing. Perhaps someone has taken the other off. So now maybe she feels sorry for all her scheming, like Ewa. How do you mean? She does things to... to make me worry for the children. What kinds of things? Let's see the next picture. Can you make up a story for this one? Maybe this old woman is whispering something to her. About what? It could be anything. Maybe that there's something wrong with their child... that he has run away. Did you run away when you were a boy? I escaped from my father during the war. I went back to my mother's house. Was he mistreating you? He was neglectful. And I realized that my mother was even a greater evil. She was evil. She was hurting us children... abusing us. She was punishing you? Beating us up. You are very clever. I've learned something from you today. No, Maggie. Janet explained. She said misdemeanor charges get dropped automatically after two months. But if he makes them think he's well, he can be out in a matter of days. MAGGIE (ON PHONE): Days? Listen. You gotta do something, gal. Talk to his doctor. All right. Maybe if we talked to the doctors. MAGGIE (ON PHONE): Right. Now what are you waiting for? Give them a call right now. Sorry I'm late. Excuse me. Mr. Olson, Adam's attorney. Mr. Haggarty. - Oh, how do you do? - Mr. Haggarty. [inaudible] Mrs. Berwid. Oh. Mr. Olson, my assistant Ms. Lander... Landry. [clears throat] [coughs] Excuse me. Cup of coffee, Mr. Olson? Thank you. Some sugar. Now that the treatment team has assembled, we'd like to reassure us to Adam's progress. You must understand that I appreciate your concern. I really do. Well, we're just trying to prevent a murder here, Dr. You know, four months ago, Adam went into a homicidal rage. Uh, Mr. Haggarty, he has calmed down considerably since then. He shows equilibrium, good control of his impulses. Well, of course he has. Because he's in here and she's out there. That's why. That's right. And while he's in here it is my job to cure him, Mr. Haggarty. All the charges against him have been dropped. By some automatic bureaucracy. Not by Mrs. Berwid. Ms. Landry, they have been dropped. Now as long as Adam is my patient and I think I can help him I'm going to treat the man until he is released or transferred. When will that be, Dr.? Well, given what you have said here... and I do take that into consideration... we might hold him, uh, another six months. And after that I suspect we will, uh, transfer him to, um, Pilgrim State Hospital. Wait a minute. There's practically no security there. And that's less than an hour away Ewa's house. Well, that's the intention, Mr. Haggarty. We're ordered by the state to transfer patients to hospitals as, uh, close as possible to their home communities. BEN HAGGARTY: That's just what Mr. Berwid wants. DOCTOR: That's how it is, Mr. Haggarty. BEN HAGGARTY: That's just terrific. Well, that's... that's just great. And now he extends my sentence in this prison here. Come on now. What do you expect? Huh? I mean, it's not as if you've been exactly cooperative. Huh? That makes no difference. I am to be held here only if I'm acting out hostilities. That's the law. And I haven't been doing that. OK. You haven't been doing that. Why? Why haven't you been doing it? Is it because you just want to get out of here? Or is it because you're free of the hostilities toward your ex-wife? Hm? Which one is it, Adam? Adam. I believe we're going to see more and more solid fuel power plants in the future. So Mrs. Berwid could not have arrived here at a better time. And it should not surprise anyone who's seen her work on the piping layouts and the boiler blow-down system that I'm naming her head of this project. Ewa, come on up here and take over. Congratulations. It's all yours. Thank you. Um, well, as Mr. Norton says, I believe that the Resource Recovery Plant is only the first of many such plants. Uh, we estimate that the project will take approximately one year, and um, I want to thank Mr. Norton for his confidence in me. I... I will do my very best to see that the project goes smoothly, and to prove myself worthy of this job. [music playing] It shows up under the blue light. Come on, gal. Come on. We're going to have a great time. I... I don't know any of these dances. Just watch the others. They don't seem to know either. You got the idea. [music playing] Hey, Joe! Sounds great! You know, you've got great eyes, Ewa. Why don't you use a little eye shadow. Open up the color a little. Really? Yeah. What about my hair, Maggie? What can I do with my hair? [inaudible]? I don't know. Maybe a little softer on the face and two shades lighter. Ooh. Ooh-ooh. That is a hot number. See you later. [music playing] (READING) Dear Ewa, you saved my life, and I thank you for that. I could have been dead by now. And the children would be without a father. Because of the metabolic changes in my personality, I am afraid I was going through an emotional crisis this past year. It took me more time to recover than I expected. But I'm healthy physically now and also emotionally. They've even shown me my progress on a diagram. I've made great progress here at Mid-Hudson. The staff understands me. They have worked hard with me. Next week I am leaving here, and I'll be transferred to Pilgrim State Hospital. (READING) Dear Adam, I have received a number of letters from you. In your last one, you have misinterpreted all my actions and intentions. I have no feelings left for you... love or hate. I can never coexist with you as lovers or in any other way. I think you should concentrate on getting well so that you can organize your life and start fulfilling your responsibilities. As I said, I am not your enemy, and I don't want to fight you. I hope you will get better soon. The children send their love. That there's the administration building. Take a look at it. Look at this. People come and go, but anybody that goes, comes back. You see? When this lights up in the night time it's like Hollywood Boulevard... the Palladium in England. It's a beautiful place. Over there's the Pilgrim. Take a look at that. The Pilgrim. Beautiful place. I got a condominium there. In 11C and 11B two condominiums, one co-op. Then we have disco dancing. They play the "Star-Spangled Banner." (SINGING) Hey, baby, disco baby. Champagne party every Saturday night, baby. And you're gonna love it, too, baby. Let me tell you something. One thing I can tell you. Two prisoners were here from the United States. Let me tell you something. This is a beautiful joint. Anybody comes here stays the rest of their life. I bring my wife here once a week. I got a little kid. I'll break him into the joints. You can't go wrong. You can't miss it. You have nothing to worry about. Relax. When you get in there, you'll do more talking than me. I got news for you. I want to see a doctor. I want to know why I'm being kept here against my will. [interposing voices] Fred. Hey! Hey, hey, ho! Hey, hey, hey! That's enough. That's enough. Huh? All right. All right. [inaudible] So what do we have today? Uh, we have six renewals, Dr. And, uh, we have a new admission. I'm just making up his chart. Adam Berwid, transferred from Mid-Hudson. He's paranoid, obsessive-compulsive. Incarcerated for threatening his wife. No medication. Uh, what's he look like? He's very well put together. He's very calm. But I think... [inaudible]. [interposing voices] They seem to have taught you rather well, Mr. Berwid. Oh, yes. I learned many things at Mid-Hudson... how to wash my face, how to brush my teeth. We'll continue that here too. Uh, the cupboard. Mr. Berwid? I'm Dr. Huffman. Or should I say, Dr. Berwid? Mr. Berwid has a doctorate in nuclear engineering. I'm impressed. Thank you. I'm looking forward to going back to work as soon as my ex-wife calms down about me, of course. Yeah, I've never had the good luck to meet anyone from Poland before. Maybe you could explain to me the connection between the Catholic Church and the government. The Church is corrupt, like any man-made institution. Myself, I think, nobody should get between a man and God. That's interesting. I'd like to discuss this at length some time. See you soon. Thank you, Dr. Huffman. A doctor of nuclear engineering, huh? What else you have there, huh? Four shirts. OK. You seem a bit down in the mouth, Adam. Is it because the anniversary of your divorce is coming up? It makes me a little sad. The divorce is a kind of death. Mourning is part of the recovery process. It's natural. Yes. I've read that theory somewhere. I imagine you have. You're read everything in the library. That's what makes it such a pleasure to talk to you. Tell me, Adam, what do you feel about nuclear power as an expert. Well, I think it's very dangerous. Human beings can't handle it. What about the disposal of waste products? Good question, Dr. Huffman. But you see, it's a far more serious problem in Poland than in the West. But as long as it's in the hands of the bureaucracy, they have better control. But it is in the hands of politicians. And they think only in terms of power and profits. Could you trust them? [gunshot] You're good, gal. So what's he like? Come on. You know I'm dying to know. [sigh] Well, his name is Tom. He's strong and loving, wonderful with the children. And he does the dishes. [laughter] Robert Redford or Paul Newman? - More like Clint Eastwood. - Ooh. And he does the dishes? Has he got a brother? Maggie, I'll ask. [gunshot] OK. Here we go. Hot off the presses. Thank you. We'll have one of these in every squad car in town. OK. Let's see now. Lawyer's name. Yes. You got the signals straight? The police come if the porch light is off. Good. All right. You tell your neighbors too. - Yes. I will. - OK. And the gun permit? Oh, yes. Uh, right over here. You certainly did qualify. Sergeant, thank you for all your help. Uh, do you mind if I ask you something? No. Why don't you just move? Actually I've been applying for new jobs out of state. Good. [inaudible] Tom? Well, if he asks me I won't go, but it's not settled yet. Ah. I get the picture. And Sergeant, I know it will be safer here. You'll watch me, and you'll watch out for Adam. The minute I move, you won't worry about him anymore. Yeah, well, we will keep on top of it. You rest easy, Mrs. Berwid. And you can call me any time. Thank you. Bye-bye, Ms. Landers. ADAM BERWID: (READING) Dear Ewa, why have you not written to me again? I hope that you don't still believe my past threats. As the Bible says, forget the past. For some time now I have the feeling that our whole family and our marriage were victims of someone's dirty tricks. I never believed you really wanted to get the divorce. I know as you do that it is best for the children to have two parents. We both have obligations to the children. I know you're still too frightened to visit me. Please don't be afraid. I'm OK. Also there are numbers of security people. And I can come in a security jacket if you wish. Please. We must see each other and talk. Last night I... I was dreaming. And then I was remembering how you baked bread that morning. Do you remember? I guess we're both a little nervous. I guess so. After all the problems I'm causing you're very forgiving to come here. When do you think you'll be released? Not till the judge sees that the, uh... that the atmosphere between us is completely clear. Is it? On my part, yes. Of course I can understand how you might not be certain. You know, after I'm released I... I wanted to ask you if you would like to go traveling for a few days. We still have the last name, which would alleviate suspicions. Adam, we're divorced. I have a new life now. Of course. I imagine such an attractive woman has many boyfriends. You haven't asked about the children. I'm glad you didn't bring them, though. This is not such a nice place for them to see. Adam, why did you accuse me of those things with Daniel? I was going crazy. Everyone knows that. But were you just saying those things, or were you... I... Ewa, let's forget the past like the Bible says. Anyway, I have to go soon. I'm just trying to understand what happened. You understand perfectly what happened. But did you really believe that I was doing those things to our son? - I have to go now. Adam, wait. [slam] Now you say you'll issue Adam day passes? If he continues to show steady improvement, of course. Legally my hands are tied. And while they should be. Yeah, maybe this isn't the time for us to be so liberal here. You're so concerned about Adam's rights. What about the potential rights of the victim? A woman's life could be at stake here. I understand the issues. That's not going to happen in this case. Oh, is that right? Oh. What if we we're right and you're wrong? Hm? You ever think of that? What exactly do you propose? At least notify us if Adam leaves the hospital grounds. All right. We'll put the phone number on Adam's file to be used only in the event of his escape. Thank you. It's a pity that society finds it so hard to forgive. [knocking] No. Hold no a minute. What do you want, Adam? Might I come in? Sure. I have a day pass. I'll ring you right back. Um. Uh, let me check that, Adam. OK? Sure. OK. Thank you, Mrs. Karris. You'll be back on time, won't you? Sure. [music playing] [interposing voices] BEN HAGGARTY: My favorite song. (SINGING) London Bridge is falling down. Boys Was girls together. Boys and girls. Live in [inaudible]. [interposing voices] Trip the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York. East side... FEMALE VOICE: Why don't we sing something else. BEN HAGGARTY: I love this. [singing] [interposing voices] Want to sing something [inaudible]? [humming] (SINGING) London Bridge is falling down. [inaudible]. Boys and girls together. Where's my piece of cheesecake? [laughter] Later. [singing] [laughter] [interposing voices] [scatting] Gerry, uh, see if Adam is in the canteen for me, will you? And try the gym too. And let me know. [interposing voices] Dr. [tapping] I thought you'd gone. [screaming] What is it? Adam Berwid hasn't come back yet. Uh, have you seen the cover on his file? Shouldn't someone be notified? Mrs. Karris, emergency notification does not apply to a day pass. Extend Adam's curfew till 9:00. I talk to him in the morning. Thanks. Dr. Huffman told me you were worried, Mrs. Karris. I'm sorry about that. Just lost track of the time. And then she got all emotional on me, jumped up right into a cab, and gone in the night. [laughter] Actually there's a big plus to this. I didn't have to drive her home last night. What is it, Adam? I have a pass. What? I want to go into town and buy a decent coat. I thought you went yesterday. And also today, Mrs. Karris. I'll go down with you, Adam. OK? Uh, wait here till I get back, Gerry. Right. Adam, would you hold on for a moment here, please? I'll be right with you. [knocking] Dr. Chang, could I speak with you for a moment? It's important. - Please. Come in. DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): Dr. Huffman here. Dr. Huffman, Dr. Chang here. Yes, Dr. Um, I understand that you've given Adam Berwid another day pass. DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): That's correct. Well, in view of patient's history, I must say, I have some misgivings. And so do some of the members of his treatment team. DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): You mean, Nurse Karris? Among others, yes. Don't you think it's a bit premature to be letting him out? DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): He has my complete confidence. In my experience, these passes reap great therapeutic rewards. I am registering my concern. DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): Rest assured there's nothing to worry about. Goodbye. Thank thank, Dr. Huffman. We're going to have ice cream. Yeah. And a little snack. Yeah. You guys are happy about this, huh? - Really, Mommy. - We're going to see Maggie. Oh, boy. And do some shopping. I'm getting into the front seat. No. I am. Now, don't argue. Maggie, I'd like your opinion on this drawing. I did it last night. It... it's my first red dress. Uh-huh. [buzz] [video game music playing] Mom, can I have a quarter? Daniel, you want a whole quarter? Yeah. What about your sister? Does she want a quarter? No. So what do you think? Well, it's great, but are you going to wear that to the office? It's for Tom's party. Oh, well. So, uh, when's the wedding? Well. Come on. I saw that moving van stuff on your desk. Maggie, that was in my desk. Um, right. You caught me. [inaudible] Mommy. Mommy, can I have four quarters because Sara's beating me. Daniel. He thinks I'm a bank. [laughter] Two quarters. And you give one to your sister. That kid drives a hard bargain. Yes. [laughter] He's an American child. MAGGIE: And you're a Polish pushover. Can you help me? Yes, sir. What can I do for you? [inaudible] please on knives. What kind? To hunt. Hunting knives. Here we go. These are excellent knives. Me and my son, we go up to Bear Mountain sometimes. It's nice. I have that knife there. It's an excellent knife. Uh, it comes with the scabbard. [train horn] (YELLING) Hello. Hello! Yes. Berwid. Berwid. I fell asleep on the train. Missed my stop. Of course I will be late. What train? Where? Well, when was the next one due? (ANGRILY) Well, why didn't you ask? Look, just put me through to a doctor. They all went home? [phone ringing] OK, children. We're home. Sara, I'll race you to the door. - OK. - Oh, no. No racing. [slam] [voices on television] Oh, Sara, no television now. You have you milk... SARA: Please let me watch. No. You have your milk and go straight to bed. OK? And can I have your jacket, Daniel? [inaudible]. Yes. Don't you dare spill the milk on them. Don't worry. I never spill the milk. [children arguing] Eat it. No! [inaudible]. Children, please stop. - No. - Just milk. No cookies. Hello. Adam, don't come any closer. I'm sorry you're still so scared. Adam, please. You know you mustn't be here. They why not call the police? I will. Children, take your milk and come to bed please. Sara. - Mommy, was that Daddy? Yes, Daniel. He's come to talk to Mommy. Come on. I want to see him. Me too. Not now. You come to bed now. Daniel. Daniel! Mommy, can I see Daddy? No. Please go upstairs now and go to sleep, children. [banging] No. (SCREAMING) Adam, no. [inaudible]. No! Adam! I did not do anything. Oh, police! [scream] 9-1-1 OPERATOR (ON PHONE): 9-1-1. [screaming] Hello. All right. Stop screaming and tell me where you are. [screaming] Ma'am! Where are you? Stop! 9-1-1 OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Hello. Police. 9-1-1 OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Ma'am, tell me where you are. [moaning] 9-1-1 OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Hello. Ma'am, tell me where you are. Hello! [screaming] Hello. Ma'am. (SCREAMING) He's... he's killing me! Oh, God! [phone ringing] MALE VOICE ON POLICE SCANNER: We have a missing person report from Pilgrim State. Patient's name is Adam Berwid. Resides at 6538 Wellington. Patient is four hours overdue, and the nurses are afraid he may come back after his ex-wife. POLICE OFFICER: This place is quiet. There's nobody around. Hello. I got your number from a... a bulletin my ex-wife made up about me. ADAM BERWID (ON PHONE): My name is Adam Berwid. I killed her last night, Sergeant. I'll be waiting at the house for you. [knocking] DR. HUFFMAN (ON PHONE): Come in. But I ask you, gentlemen, where do you turn at a time like this? Where do you find comfort in escape of guilt we all, in some measure, have to share? We all know Ewa Berwid, have little left but her memory. Beloved friend, respected colleague, devoted, selfless mother. No senseless act of violence can rob us of this. But in the shadows of a troubled homeland, the black terror of her marriage to a madman, Ewa Berwid reached for the light. And she found it. Though she enjoyed happiness and confidence too briefly, her image will remain forever in our hearts. I want you to remember her, gentlemen. and grieve with all of us who knew her. And resolve, as I do. Ewa Berwid's death won't be the last of its kind. NARRATOR: Partly as a direct result of Ewa Berwid's death, certain procedures for releasing mental patients with a criminal history have been changed. Now in many states, panels of doctors must agree to the release, and interested parties must be notified. In her will, Ewa Berwid left instructions that her children reside with a family she had known for some time. In 1983, the estate of Ewa Berwid was awarded $600,000 in a wrongful death suit brought against the state of New York. Adam Berwid was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to prison for 35 years to life. He will be eligible for parole in the year 2016. [music playing] [trumpet anthem]
