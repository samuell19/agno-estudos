Is the bloom off the Ivy Rose? What's up, guys? It's me, Dan Buford, here with your Celebrity Gossip. Pop sensation, Ivy Rose, may seem to have it all. Legions of adoring fans, an up-and-coming social media megastar boyfriend in Becker Daniels, and her most recent album, "Party Nights... [It's Party Time]" has been at the top of the charts for 16 weeks with no sign of slowing down. But the situation is a little more thorny than Ivy's public image may suggest. The Celebrity Gossip Minute has obtained exclusive information from sources close to the pop star that Ivy's life is drama-city right now. Word is she's battling her manager-extraordinaire, Naomi Klein, and her record label on the creative direction of her career. Things with her and Becker are wilting fast. Peter Pan complex much? And, apparently, Ivy wants to avoid the one thing pop stars desperately crave: the spotlight. Drama. But, look out, it's not all bad news. We also have it on authority that Ivy will soon be performing songs from her album at a very small, very intimate venue, very exclusive. You heard it here first, folks. And remember what we always say, "They're just rumors, so you can't sue us." And that's all for this edition of Celebrity Gossip Minute. We'll see you next time. Wow, Becker, this place is really romantic. Only the best for you, babe. Excuse me, you can't just walk in here! [camera shutter clicking] Hey, guys, we're just trying to have a quiet dinner in peace. How about cutting us some slack? Wow, that's new. I thought you loved the spotlight. Yeah, well, I thought about what you said the other night. See? I listen. And I also needed a private moment to be able to do this. Okay. Woman: Oh my God, wow. Ivy... [chuckles nervously] You make me want to be a better man. I want nothing more than to buy a house, to get married, fill it with kids and grow old and gray together. Will you do me the favor of looking over there and saying, "I've just been skunked!" Wait, wait, what? What is this? It's a prank. We're gonna be on "Skunked". This is awesome, right? No! No, this is not awesome. Why would you do this? Come on. You said you wanted to feel normal. I was like I will show her what normal is. Normal sucks. No. I thought it was really sweet and romantic. We're two of the most famous people in the world. When I propose to you, it's gonna be insane. I don't want insane. I wanted the real version of that. I can't do this anymore. Look, you're mad. I'm sorry. No. I've been feeling like this for a really long time. But tonight, it just solidified it. We're on two different pages. It's not fair to either one of us to pretend that we're not, okay? I'm sorry. It's over. It's over? First off, we just wanted to start by saying how excited we are to be in the Ivy Rose business. International pop star, Ivy Rose. So excited. Thank you. You know, what about when I'm not working, I could take the wig off. And that way, I can move around the world undetected and kind of have some privacy. No, the wig stays. Ivy Rose isn't just about music. It's a vibe. And maintaining that vibe is so, so important. I mean, would people even know who you are without the wig? That's kind of the point. So we all know that your last album was a hit. But we feel it's time Ivy Rose grew up. I'm so glad to hear you say that. I was thinking maybe I could write my own music for my next album. Right. Well, we'd love if that were possible, Ivy. The thing is, Sean and I kind of have this down to a science. Trust the experts, Ivy. But I actually became a musician so that I could perform my own music, you know. Kind of like Taylor Swift's "Folklore." I want my own "Folklore!" We actually feel like "Party Night [It's Party Time]" is your "Folklore." Your next album would actually be your "Evermore". Oh, I just got the chills. Right? If your song ain't in the club, it's a flub. As I like to say. But it's true. It's true. [bell rings] Oh! Just the man I was looking for. Hi, Cameron. Darren, I have scored two extremely exclusive tickets for a intimate small launch party with five-time Grammy winner, Ivy Rose! Cameron, that's awesome, it really is. I just have so much to get done around the store. Well, how about this? You can give me a list of things to do. And then I'll go and do them so that you two can go and have some fun. Oh, thank you. Perfect. Darren, what do you say? Yeah, all right. I'll go. Yay. This is great! See you later. - Bye. - Bye! Enjoy the show. I'll get you back for this. Ah! Front row. Front row! Oh, my, yes. - Amazing. - Cool. Oh, this is so incredible. Yeah. So, what? What kind of music does she sing? Darren, really? Naomi? What if I played some of my own music just for tonight? Since the audience is so small. I mean, I wish, Ivy... I really, really wish. It's just that this promo is for your album, and you know the fans. They only really want to hear the hits. - You get it. - Yeah. Don't make my own choices. Just do what I'm told. You got it. Does she have purple hair or is that a thing? Is that her thing? Yes, Darren, she has purple hair. Okay. How come you don't have a purple wig on? Oh, I... I just thought my hair looked nice. Oh, no, it does. It's show time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are so excited to host this one-time unplugged event with five-time Grammy winner, Ivy Rose!

What are you doing here? [gasping] - Oh my God! - Hey, it's Becker. Ivy... Oh! I have been so sad since you dumped me. We belong together, Ivy. I'm begging you... Please, give me another chance. So you thought the way to get me back was to ambush me in my performance? That's an insult to me and the audience. We love it! Cameron, stop! Are you kidding me? BE-VY! BE-VY! BE-VY! Cameron, stop! She's uncomfortable. Oh my! BE-VY! BE-VY! - Come on, Darren. - No. [chanting continues] She doesn't... Aw... Babe, this is our couple name. Come here. Come here. I know this is gonna sound crazy. Can you kiss me... right now? I mean, if you want to. How's this for spontaneous? What? Nothing. [camera shutters clicking] - That's cold. - What's going on? I said we were over and I meant it. Poison Ivy! Who are you? Darren. [scoffs] Cameron? Can someone tell me what the heck is going on with you? I don't know. I guess I'm starting to make my own choices. Well, your "choice" tonight made things a lot harder for you, for me, for both of us! You're being painted as cruel and coldhearted. #poisonivy is trending right now! Oh, uh... Hey, remember me? Crazy lady who made you kiss them onstage? Oh, yeah. I vaguely remember that. You didn't make me. You gave me an out. Well, how kind of me. I just want to say that I'm sorry for roping you into all of that back there. You were really a good sport about it. Hey, that is the most excitement I've had in a very long time. Though I can't say the same for my date. Hence why I'm waiting for a rideshare. Oh, thanks. I'm sorry about that. Nah, it wasn't meant to be, I guess. I really enjoyed it, by the way. I'm sorry? Um, the performance. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I thought you were talking about something else. Thanks. They don't let me write my own music, so... Oh, thank... those lyrics. Oh, nice! Oh, too honest? I mean, it's refreshing, but a little mean. Okay, I'm sorry. You said you didn't write them, though? Yes, but I'm allowed to say that, not you. What makes you the musical expert anyway? Well, I do own a record store in Deer Falls, so... Huh. I will say this. You sure do know how to make a statement. Oh, how rude of me to kiss you without introducing myself first. I'm Ivy Rose. Nice to meet you, Ivy Rose. I'm Darren Howard. Nice to meet you, Darren Howard. [phone chimes] Crazy night, huh? Crazy life. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear and leave it all behind. And live a quiet, normal life with a quiet, normal job. Well, if you want a quiet, normal job in a quiet, normal town, I know just the place. Trust me. It's not all it's cracked up to be. I'm sure it's great. [phone rings] This is me. Goodnight. Hey, I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you. [sighs] [phone chiming] [phone rings] [phone chimes] Deer Falls. Wall of Sound Records. A place to find myself. This is my "Folklore." [chuckles] Wow, this is even better than the pictures. A place to find myself. Perfect. You know, they have computers that can pay bills now. Yeah, well, you know me. I'm more of an analog guy. Hmm, yeah. Well, the digital world loves you. I mean, the sheer number of angles they got of that kiss? - Mwa! - Aw, geez. Okay, back on the floor. Let's go. - And show me. One. - It's beautiful. One picture. - Yeah, it's beautiful. - Show me. Pull out your snapchat or whatever. What picture do you want to start off with first? The closeup or the full angle? The best one. Okay. - Well, then there's this one. - Oh, God. This is an "Oh!" Okay, I've seen enough, thank you. Your face! Wait! What... Aw, come on. This is like the biggest celebrity story like ever. Maybe you're not as lame as I thought. Okay, I'm still your boss, you know. That was a compliment! Well, now that the excitement is over, we still have the store to run. So let's get back to work. Oh, hi. Welcome to Wall of Sound Records. Can I help you? Hi. Oh, my gosh, Darren? Darren Howard? I'm sorry. Do we know each other? [gasps] That's your real hair? Ivy Rose? Yeah. Bingo! So what brings you here, stranger? Well, this, you know, is my record store, the one that I told you about last night. What brings you here, stranger? Well, you said that if I was ever in town that I should stop by, so... So here you are, less than 24 hours later. Yeah, what a coincidence, right? Right. Okay. I know this must seem crazy. I feel crazy. I just... last night, you were so nice to me. And I can't remember the last time someone was just genuinely nice to me without wanting something in return. So I just thought... I'm gonna stop talking now. Hold on, hold on. It's okay. I liked talking to you too last night. Talking. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Karina. Big fan. And Karina was just getting back to work, wasn't she? Ugh. Not fair. Anyway, I thought this would be a perfect place for me to kind of decompress and reconnect with my work. So I rented a house and I'm just gonna kind of see where it all takes me. Okay. Well, cool. I guess I'll see you around then. What if I like worked here? - Worked here? - Yeah. Remember quiet, normal job? I mean, I don't know. It... I think what he means to say is that he doesn't know why you didn't ask sooner. Oh, is that what I meant? Yeah, I get it, and you don't even have to pay me anything. I'll blend right in. You didn't even recognize me without the wig, right? And, more importantly, I didn't recognize you. Did I mention I'm a big fan? And, look, I'll be here, you know. Like I'll help you. There's not a lot to do anyway. My loyal employee. I'm not getting out of this without saying yes, am I? [both] No. Okay. Well, Ivy Rose, welcome to Wall of Sound Records. You're hired-ish! Oh, my gosh! Yes! Thank you! Do I get a badge? A badge. I can make you a badge. No, we don't wear badges. What are you up to, Ivy Rose? Morning, Ivy. Welcome. Well, if you don't want any unwanted attention, I can't go by Ivy, right? So I am Jamie reporting for duty. Why Jamie? It's my real name. I haven't gone by it since high school. So what are my duties, boss? Oh, please don't call me boss. Makes me feel old. You are old. Choosing to ignore that. Let's get to work! - Okay. - Great! Show me what I do. - Here's the records. - Ooh, okay. So what do we do? We have a pretty purple one... [chattering] [clears throat] Hi! Welcome to the Wall of Sound Records. I am Jamie, and you are... Oh, I'm Paige. Wow, not used to be asked that in a store. Well, that's the kind of customer service we provide here at Wall of Sound Records. So formal. So is there anything I can help you with? Yeah. I'm looking for "Party Night [It's Party Time]" by Ivy Rose. Right, yeah. That's... we could find that. If I was Ivy Rose... which I'm not... What section would I be in? - You put the price on the... - You know what? Can you give me a minute while I ask my associate something? - Yeah. - Okay, thanks. Um, oddly, she is looking for one of my albums. Awkward. We don't actually carry your music here. Okay. I don't hate that, but maybe you can just point me to the pop section so we can save the sale? There is no pop section, modern pop anyway. See, Darren doesn't believe in pop music. Okay, it's not like I don't believe it, like it's a ghost or something. I just happen to believe that pop peaked around 1983. Before you were born? My dad brought me up on the classics. What can I say? Okay. I'm so sorry, Paige. We don't carry that here. Is there anything else I can help you with? I'm sorry. Are you... No, sorry. I thought you were somebody I went to high school with. Yeah, I guess I have one of those familiar faces. Well, thank you anyway. I'll just have to go somewhere else. - Okay. - Thanks. Bye. Sorry. Well, the disguise works, I'll give you that. Yeah, I told you it would. But, more importantly, we lost a sale. Ah, yes. Welcome to every day of Wall of Sound Records. Hey, I'm sitting right here. So? Okay. I understand that you already gave me an extension. I just... gotta go. A customer just came in. Hey, is everything okay? Can I help you with anything? Nope. Just business stuff. Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about? Sir, this is my place of employment. Okay, not in the mood for jokes. Sorry. Just... long day. [phone rings] Can I make an observation about the store? One day working in a record store and she's already an expert. I don't have to be an expert to see what's wrong in your business model. With music streaming, it's a miracle anyone would want to walk into a record store and buy physical music at all. So at least when they do, you can have what they want. So what's the deal? For me, it was always about operating a store that was a collector's dream. Audiophile's paradise. How about a truce? How about I take you to dinner? - I don't know. I... - Come on. It's the least I can do after I made you kiss me in front of my ex-boyfriend. I rented a house in your town and I came to your store and made you give me a job. Wow. When you list it all out like that, it's kind of a lot. Yeah, it is. All right, you got me. Dinner it is. Great! Okay. So where do people eat around here? Nice place, huh? Yes, this is very... uh. - Thank you. - Thank you. Very French. Best Deer Falls has to offer. So you come here often? Oh, yeah, all the time. My favorite dish is the, um... Con-fit de co... canard. Your favorite, huh? Get it all the time. You've clearly never been here before. Figured it'd be nothing but the finest things in life for our VIP guest. Well, I'm Jamie, remember? No VIP status here. Okay. Okay, and is Jamie saying she doesn't want to eat here? Jamie doesn't want to eat here. Jamie wants real food. Thank God. I think I could accommodate that. This house is incredible. I love it here. It's so peaceful. Your, uh, cheeseburger, Miss. Now this is more like it. Mm! - Good? - This burger is next level. Sorry they didn't have any of your Con-fit co-nard. Right. I'm still so insulted that you took me there. Well, I guess it's fair that you have something on me since I already have so much on you. Should I go over that list again? No, I think we're good. Yeah. So what about the "why"? Why? I mean, don't get me wrong. I love music with all of my heart. But I just... I didn't know it was gonna be what it is. And what is it? My life doesn't belong to me. My image, my relationship... just everything is about preserving ticket and record sales. So it's just pressure, pressure, pressure building all the time. So here I am, Deer Fall's number one unpaid intern. It probably didn't hurt that I was, like, you know, super handsome. Moderately handsome... from a distance. Okay. You couldn't even give me that? Well, thank you for gracing us with your presence, runaway pop star. So what about you? I'm divorced. Oh. I'm sorry. No, no, don't be. No, we were just kids, you know. We figured that's what you do after college. But as we grew up together, we realized that we were both heading in different directions. Well, that's a pretty mature outlook you have. I can say that now with years of hindsight. So, yeah, I took out way too big of a loan, you know. And I didn't know the first thing about running a record store. But when my marriage dissolved, I still had the store. And what a great store it is, very old school. Yeah, that's what I was going for. When I was a kid, our basement looked like that. You know, the shag carpeting, wood paneling, all that. Super dated, but also awesome. My dad and I used to hang out down there and listen to old records. Oh. So that explains the "my music peaked in 1983" stance. Yeah. I figured, you know, when you get in one of those audiophile blogs and you turn it all around, if somebody like Miles Enderman gives your store a good review, you got it made. I wrote him once a week the first two years the store was open, never replied. So finally I just threw in the towel. Guess maybe I should do that with the store, too. What if we can help save the store? Consider it an exchange for letting me hide out from my problems. Don't say that. It's okay. I know what I'm doing and I want to help you save the store. We just need to make a few changes. What kind of changes? Sale? Yeah. Are we having a sale? Well, yes. Actually, can you hand me that box down there? You can help me put it up here? Go through it? - Ivy? - Yes? The whole idea is to make more money, not less. Since you have no customers to begin with, it's just called marketing. Also, there are baked goods. We can pass these out to our customers. I made them myself. - Oh... - Go on. Try one. Fine. A little bite here. What recipe did you use? I didn't. I just did it from scratch. Well, it's a good thing that we don't have any customers, because these can't give these to anyone. I'm closing the door. No! Then people won't know it's a sale! There is no sale... or non-sale sale, whatever it is! I think he's just on a diet. Ladies and gentlemen! Come one, come all! You won't be laughing when you see this collection! Absolutely not! This is not a carnival! Yes, yes, yes! Go, go, go, go! Please don't do that. Okay, guys, guys, please be careful. No, no, no, no. - Please don't... - What? That is our last copy of that one. Remember, folks! Inside one very special record is a golden ticket for a very special prize! Nope! Shut it down! Shut it down. [sighs] I can't believe he shut down every single one of my ideas. Hey, Ivy? - Yeah? - Can I ask you something? Sure. What made you change your style? I used to watch your videos you put out on the internet, and it was just you in your bedroom with a guitar. It felt like you were just like me. And then you got famous and then everything changed. I mean, I know your life changed, but the songs just didn't sound like you anymore. I know what you mean. It's because they really aren't me anymore. They want Ivy Rose, the look and Ivy Rose, the voice. But not Ivy Rose, the mind. I mean, have you tried songwriting? Yeah. I was just so stressed out all the time, everything I would write felt forced and lame. And then I was gonna write ere. But I was in such a rush getting out of town that I forgot my guitar, so... I have one. Two, in fact! I keep one in the back of the store. - You want to borrow it? - No, no, Karina. It's okay. You don't have to do that. I don't wanna borrow your guitar. No! Are you kidding? The fact that I'll be able to say that Ivy Rose played my guitar... I mean, if you really mean it, I'd actually really like that. I do. Forget it. You came here to disconnect. And it's an opportunity to... I don't know. Reconnect with yourself? I mean, that's what this whole thing is about anyway, right? Yeah. Reconnect with myself because myself is awesome. I know you were just trying to help earlier. I guess I have a hard time with change. That's the understatement of the century. [phone rings] [leaf blower] [knocking] Hi! What's up? Wanna hang out? Ivy? You're here... at my house. Plus, I got you coffee and a muffin. Aren't you supposed to be reconnecting with yourself? Yeah, I tried that. It's a work in progress, baby steps. Come on. Let's go. Fine. I'll take that. So I didn't pack many clothes before coming here. Know of any good thrift stores? Oh, my gosh! Look at this store! So cute! I never figured you for a vintage girl. Oh, my gosh. In high school, that's pretty much all I would wear. None of that fast fake vintage stuff, you get the real deal. Kind of like your store. I see your point. Yeah. Nowadays, I really never get to decide what I'm gonna wear. But today is a new dawn and a new me. Look at this hat! Isn't that cute? It's a statement. A statement, yes. I like this statement. Yeah. [chuckles] Yes. Ta-da! Yes. - Yeah? - Yeah. But how do you feel? I feel amazing. - Then I'm glad you got them. - Thank you. Yeah, I feel like I struck gold. You want me to take that for you? Yeah. Thanks for spending Sunday with me. I can think of worse ways to spend a Sunday. Shall we? You've got to be kidding me! Hey, it's okay. I told them that I was working on getting the money... Or a buyer. Guess I didn't realize it was that bad. Well, if something doesn't happen soon, then I'm gonna lose the store before I can even sell it. I'm really sorry. Yeah, well, not everything works out the way it's supposed to. Hey, is that your dad? Yeah. He was my hero. We lost him my senior year of high school. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know. No, don't worry. How would you know? Having his picture there, it kind of grounds me. This place, the vibe, the whole aesthetic, it actually feels like it's keeping his memory alive. That makes sense. I actually lost my mom a few years ago. It was really hard. I'm sorry, too. She was my best friend, and she was so supportive of my career in music. Sometimes I feel like I'm letting her down. Letting her down? Like what if I'm not really that good? Ivy, if you're not that good, then we're all in trouble. And yeah everyone has imposter syndrome sometimes. You know the number of times I thought I wasn't fit to run a record store? Although that one might actually be true. Okay, stop. Okay, this store, it's great. It's just your marketing... Yeah, well, we might not have to worry about that for much longer. Hey, I said I was gonna help you with the store, didn't I? Ivy, we tried your ideas. I'm talking about something bigger. Why do I have a feeling I'm gonna regret this? Are you with me? I'm with you. - Let's do this! - All right! - Let's do it. - Yeah! Okay, ready for your surprise? I feel like an idiot. Okay. One, two, three... In addition to the lights, I added a new music section, some apparel and a stage for local artists. - Oh, and... - Darren's Basement? Yeah. I mean, you said you didn't have a real connection with the name. And so there's just so much of you in the store. So I figured the name should reflect that. If you hate it, we can just change it back. I don't hate it. No? No. No, it's actually really cool. Goodbye Wall of Sound, Hello Darren's Basement. Great! Because I already had all of this made. Merch. Ivy, thank you for doing all this. Thanks for letting me help. Hello? Are you guys gonna keep staring at each other? Or are you gonna help me unpack these boxes? - Right. Sorry. - No, that's fine. Well, let's go, sport. Hope you brought a change of clothes. It's soft relaunch time! [laughing] Come one, come all! Darren's Basement! We have a brand new remodel! You have good style, I have good style. That has good style. You should go in! Got a lot of classic records in there. Let me tell you, got amazing finds. - Guys, come in, come on! - You're gonna love it. Woo! [chattering] - Welcome to Darren's Basement! - Welcome! Darren's Basement, yep. Buy everything! Okay, two customers won't save the store, but it's a start. Relax. Rome wasn't built in a day. Was Rome for sale while they were building it? Ha-ha. Anyway, I trust you can hold down the fort. Karina here is gonna go grab lunch. And I'm gonna be in the back doing some paperwork if you need me. Okay. Yes, sir, boss, sir. Don't call me that, please. All right. Show time. Hi, there. Welcome to Darren's Basement Records. I'm Jamie. Can I help you find anything? Is all this wood original? And the carpet? Yes. Our owner, Darren Howard, actually restored it himself. Impressive. It's decidedly retro without trying too hard. Yes. That is exactly how I would describe it. Oh, wow, an Allman Brothers 1973 bootleg? Original pressing of The Beatles "Revolver" album. And a 1950 Charlie Parker "Live at Birdland". Impressive selection. Yes, well, our owner Darren Howard, he is quite the audiophile. Yeah, I can see. Yes. And over here, we have our new releases. And over here is a list of our live in-store performances. And over here, we have our brand spanking new merch. Seems like you've got everything. Yeah, pretty much. Everything except customers. That's a shame. Oh, no. You should have seen us this morning. Naturally. So is there anything I can help package up for you? No. Okay, thanks. I think I'll get on my way. Thank you. You've been very helpful. You know, it's funny. You look quite familiar. I can't quite pit it, but... Okay, good day. What a jerk! What are you always writing in there anyway? Oh, it's nothing. Miss Karina here is quite the writer. Come on. Let's see. What are you writing? Okay, it's just lyrics that I'm writing for some of my songs. Lyrics? So you've been holding out on me. Can I read? No way! That's so embarrassing! Okay. You want to talk about embarrassing? My last album was called "Party Night [It's Party Time]." Yeah, like, why say party twice? Yeah. Okay, okay. Yes. Thank you. Let's see. Oh, God... Wow! - Karina... - Don't be scared. These are amazing! Yeah, they're so personal, and raw and authentic. I told you so. No way. Ivy Rose just complimented my lyrics? No. Jamie did. Whoops. Right. Sorry. All right. I want you to check out mine. But, honestly, I've been struggling, so just be honest. Okay. Well? Okay, so spill it, what do you think? Meh. Meh? Ouch. Ouch, indeed. Okay, I appreciate the honesty. That's what I wanted, but just elaborate. Tell me what you think. I mean, they just feel like they're written by someone who's trying to seem authentic. I mean, these lyrics are very similar to the ones that you used to put out on YouTube. But isn't that a good thing? Isn't that what you liked? Well, yeah, but you're not that person anymore, are you? I mean, what about all the life you've lived in between? I mean, all the life experiences. Even the ones that you don't like should inform your art. Hey, I get what she's saying. I mean, you were Jamie long before you were Ivy Rose, right? So what does Jamie feel about Ivy Rose's career? Wow. I feel like I should know the answer to that, but I don't. Then I guess you need to figure it out to break down those walls. She's a smart one, isn't she? You both are pretty smart. Oh, really? So you know what this means, right? You have to help me. Help you? How? Well, I'm not that teenage girl writing songs in my room anymore, but you are. You mean, write with... you? Yes. Oh, my gosh, you're kidding! I'm gonna get to write with Ivy Rose. Yeah. Sounds like a Dream Team. ♪ I took the quick road out of town ♪ ♪ Don't know when I've ever been this down ♪ ♪ If I could just find my sound ♪ No, that is not good at all. Wait. What? Well, why are you giving up so easily? I just feel so stuck. Well, let's get you unstuck. Now come on, what do you wanna write about? I don't know. Everything felt so much easier when I was younger. Life is so complicated now. You know, adults say that all the time. But I don't think that's true. I mean, you guys have more stuff to do. But you swap boys for men and school for work but the emotions are still at the root of it. Hmm, I guess that's true. Yeah. So should I be writing about a man? I mean, if you want to. A man like Darren? - Karina! - What? You like him, don't you? I am not gonna talk to you about this. Why not? I mean, he likes you, you know. I can tell. And he hasn't liked someone for a long time. Well, I enjoy our professional friendship. - Your professional friendship. - Yes. Please! Oh, my gosh! Guys! Guys! What? The store! It's famous! Look at what my friend just sent to me! We're on Popular Audiophile! Popular Audiophile? Wait. Isn't that the blog you were telling me about? Yes, it's the premier blog for vinyl record enthusiasts. This is huge, but how? Oh, my! That guy! That's the guy! He was here! Miles Enderman? He was in my store? Yes! That's the jerk I was telling you about. Why didn't you come get me? I can't believe you got to meet Miles Enderman and I didn't! Wait, no. I didn't know that was him, obviously. Do you guys wanna read it or... All right, yeah. Oh, okay. Let's see. "Boasting a wood panel aesthetic "that evokes being in your buddy's basement in the 1970s, "Darren's Basement Records boasts a wide selection "of new releases, as well as an eclectic mix of classical and hard-to-find vinyl." Oh, my! "The owner and proprietor, Darren Howard, "has clearly put a lot of love and care "into the store, so be sure to put Darren's Basement Records on your itinerary." - Darren! This is huge! - This is incredible! Miles Enderman knows my name! Darren, I've never seen you this excited. Ivy, you were right. Excuse me? Can you please say that again, louder so everyone can hear? I said, you were right. You happy now? - Yes. - And get this. Our numbers in social media have basically tripled overnight! - Wow. - Wow. Now if only our customers would triple overnight. Oh, I don't think that's gonna be a problem. [chattering] This is my favorite album. You guys take checks? Yeah, we handle checks, anything. Thank you. What? Deer Falls? Naomi? Yeah, I found her. You seem extra happy tonight. I am. Or maybe that cheeseburger was tasting extra good. No, really, I... really wanted to thank you for everything you've done. You know, you don't have to keep thanking me. I basically had to torture you into letting me help you. Seriously, I got an offer on the store today. That's really good, right? A week ago, I would have said yes. But if business keeps up like this, it's gonna feel even better to tell that person no. I am so glad to hear you say that. And I know Karina will be too. Good, because I'm a little bit afraid of her. I am too, but she seems to really care about you and the store. Yep, and she really seems to want us to date. Yes, she does. Very subtle, yes. Nah, she's a good kid. Yeah. Her parents, they work a lot. She hangs around the store, picks my brain. Eventually, she started helping customers pick out music. So I figured she might as well get paid for it. That's really sweet of you. So the proverbial elephant in the room. What's next for Ivy Rose? Next? Hmm. Being here is the first time I've really, truly felt like myself. I've really, truly felt happy. Well, you could always stay. I mean, you know it would keep me from having to hire a new employee, especially since I don't pay you. Is that the only reason? I guess I do have a house here. Yeah. Yeah, you could commute. I could commute, yeah. Ivy Rose, the commuter. Yeah, listening to podcasts. Right. The glamorous world of us normies. [laughing] Well, I guess I should probably get going. Yeah. Okay. Hey, I had a really good time tonight. I did, too. We should do it again sometime. Yeah, I'd like that, boss. I said don't call me that. Goodnight, Ivy Rose. Goodnight, Darren Howard.

Actually, the lyrics yesterday, they just poured out of me. Yeah, it felt really good. Can I read? Yeah. Really? Okay. Ivy, I love these. Really? Yeah. It feels like you really found your voice again. I mean, there's some sad in here, but also a lot of happy. Ivy... Yeah, I mean, ever since I've been in Deer Falls, this is the happiest I've been in a really long time. And you're channeling your happy. Yes! Channeling my happy! Yeah, I like that. All right. So what about a songwriting session at my house tomorrow after work? Absolutely. Okay. What are you doing? It's the middle of the day. Yeah, and I just don't really feel like working right now. You don't feel like working? Shocking, huh? I'm feeling spontaneous. How about a barbecue? Yeah, a company barbecue. Yeah, I'd love a good barbecue. How about we do it in my back yard by the pool? Love it! Let's do this! - Yeah! - Okay! Come on. No work. Ah, now this is more like it. What has gotten into you? What? Can't I be in a good mood? No. Fine. Today is a celebration. Because Darren's Basement has passed over 10,000 followers on social media, which I'm told by Ms. Karina is a good thing. Yes! That is amazing! - Sparkling cider? - Oh, yes! That is so fancy! Ooh, the fanciest. Thank you. But that is not the biggest news. Spoke to my realtor today. And as of tomorrow, Darren's Basement is officially off the market. Wait. You're not selling? I'm not selling. You're not selling! [laughing] - Cheers! - Cheers. Woo-hoo! Okay, wait. I have also something special that I've been waiting for these, but I can't think of anything more special than this. Ta-da! More muffins. Uh-oh. You guys are really mean. Look. They're not crumbly like last time. Yeah. I mean, these kind of actually look edible. Yes, edible. Progress, all right? I feel like it's almost there. Almost, but I really wanna stick the landing. Well, maybe we need to test it somewhere, you know. It'll help us feel what's missing. What? Like an open mic? Something a little more intimate. Presenting... A work in progress by Ivy Rose... - And Karina. - Oh. Yeah! Okay. Don't laugh. I would never. Know what? This doesn't feel right. You have to play with me. - What? Me? - Mm-hm. - No. - Yeah, you helped me write it. So you have to play. I need your harmonies. Well, I... I have stage fright. What? You? No way. Yes, way. See? Yep. I talk a big game. But once I'm onstage, I just freeze. You know what? I used to have stage fright, too. So how'd you overcome it? Time, experience and it really helped me to play with my best friend, Sage. I keep trying to tell her it'll get better. Yeah, but what do you know? You're a boy. I'm Ivy Rose. So, what do you say? Wanna play with me? Well, I'll give it a shot. All right, come on. Oh my gosh.

That was... You're right. That felt pretty good. Any notes? [phone rings] Mr. Howard? To what do I owe this pleasure? Ooh, so formal. I just called to see if maybe you wanted to go to dinner tonight? Oh, is another burger picnic calling your name? I was thinking of something a little more indoors. Feeling good. Oh, that place, that Chez Maman? Is this revenge for the muffins? Hey, you do know there are food options in Deer Falls that fall somewhere between the burger joint and Chez Maman? Oh, this place is downright cosmopolitan then. Oh, yeah. True center of high art and culture. Pick you up at seven? Yes, I will be ready. It's a date. [sighs] Whoa. Becker? What are you doing here? Look, look. I was just worried about you. Okay, well, I'm fine, so there's nothing to worry about. How did you find me anyway? I saw a picture of you on social media. You can change your hair, but I would know you anywhere. Okay. So now you found me. What do you want? Why are you so hostile? I thought you'd be happy to see me. Okay. One, we broke up. Two, you humiliated me twice. Okay, okay. Look, I wanted to talk. Talk about what? I wanted to apologize for everything. The fake proposal, ambushing you at the concert, all of it. I was wrong. I appreciate that. Come home, Ivy. Beck, I can't. You deserve to be with someone who's just as excited about you as you are them... and someone who loves pranks. This is really not how I saw this going. I'm sorry, but it's really the best for both of us. I respect your decision and the least I can do is accept that it's over. Third time's a charm, I guess. Thanks, Beck. Take care of yourself, Ivy Rose. See, when you said you were gonna pick me up at seven, I didn't exactly expect to be stood up. Yeah, well, you seemed otherwise engaged so I figured I'd give you your privacy. What are you talking about? I saw you and Becker outside your house, Ivy. Oh, my. Darren, it... It's really not what it looked like. It doesn't matter what it was. What does matter is what it made me realize. And what's that? That it was crazy for me to think that there was a world in which you stay here. What are you talking about? I just told you I wanted to stay. Yeah, and it seemed impulsive! You weren't thinking about the future. What's to stop you from making another decision to just run away again? I would hope that you would know me better than that. I don't know what I know. Come on, it's time for both of us to admit that this was nothing more than a vacation for you. That's not what this was! Of course, it was! And that's okay! You're allowed to have a vacation from your life! This isn't a vacation for me. Okay, this is my life. Darren, you have no idea what these past few weeks have meant to me. They meant a lot to me too, believe me. I've been falling for Jamie... but you're not Jamie. You're Ivy. So what are you saying? I'm taking the offer, Ivy. I'm selling the store. Wait! I just... I don't understand! You're always talking about not selling out but that is exactly what you're doing. Yeah, cause I was being an idiot! You said it yourself! It's a miracle anyone walks into a record store these days. And I can't keep counting on miracles. That is not what I meant by that. I need to focus on a future I can count on. I don't think you should come by the store anymore. Goodbye, Ivy. Darren? Darren? [knocking] Come in! Ivy, I've been looking everywhere for you. Oh, thank goodness. I saw a picture of you in some outfit and I thought you'd lost your mind. Well, looks like you still have some sense in you. Great. As if this day couldn't get any worse. Hey, is that any way to greet your loyal manager? I've been so worried about you. Well, there's clearly nothing to worry about. I'm fine. Running off in the middle of the night? No calls, no texts? I wouldn't call that fine. Listen, if there's something that I've done wrong... I told you that I wanted more control over my career, over my life. You're right, and I owe you an apology. It's just that I always want the best for you. And this business does take a certain amount of hustle. I know what hustle is, Naomi. I know you do. Listen, we can work things out. We just have to reevaluate your schedule and find a way that you can have a life on top of the life. - You mean it? - Of course I do. Now there's a world of people out there who miss you very much. Your people, Ivy. So can we get out of here now and have things get back to normal? Yeah. Guess I'm not wanted here anyway. Attagirl. - Oh... - Hi. Can I help you? Um, yeah... sorry. I'm looking for my friend, uh... Jamie. She lives here. Jamie, yeah. I'm Addison. I'm the owner of this vacation rental. Yes, she checked out early in a rush. I'm not sure what happened. Oh... uh... okay. Sorry to bother you. Wait! You wouldn't happen to be Karina, would you? Yeah, that's me. I think I have something for you, something she left. Oh. There you go. Thank you. Yeah. "To the most talented, "refreshingly honest lyricist I know. "Thanks for trying to help me connect with myself again. "Take care of this for me. Jamie." Darren, what happened with Ivy? She won't be coming by the store anymore. Well, yeah. That much is obvious. She left town. Well, we knew that would happen eventually. Listen to you! Are you even gonna miss her? Karina, of course I am. I'm gonna miss her a lot. Then why let her leave? It's called being realistic. Just because you want something doesn't mean you get it. I mean, sure, yeah, these last couple of weeks were a lot of fun. - Fun? - Yeah, fun. But Ivy needed to go for a sure thing, and so do I. So that's it, then? You're just gonna sell the store and call it quits. I'm not calling it quits. I'm moving on with my life. Don't worry. I'm sure there'll be a job for you at the new pop-up with a much younger, hipper crowd too. No! I don't wanna work there! I wanna work here at a real record store with you and Ivy! - Ivy's gone, Karina. - And you let her go! Darren, I saw a different you ever since Ivy showed up. You were in a better mood. The store was doing better than ever. And you were letting good things into your life. Yeah, I know. But then you always fall back on this idea of responsibility. You always have to have a backup plan or a safety net. It's called being an adult, Karina! The good things that happened to you only happened to you because you took a chance. She left this for you. "Thanks for helping me find exactly what I was looking for. "Sorry I didn't get to say so in person. Jamie." [cheering] Okay, these fans have been waiting hours for a chance to get to meet you. So remember, big smiles, make eye contact. Sign a few albums and you make them feel special. Yeah. You've got it. I am so glad things are back to normal, back in the swing. Hey, what's going on? Nothing. I'm fine. You're not still thinking about that boy, are you? His name is Darren. Oh, sorry. Darren. Well, you don't have to worry about him. He's gonna be just fine. What are you talking about? Well, a little birdie told me he was having money problems. So I decided to take care of those for him. Wait. What? Are you the one who's buying the record store? Am buying. The sale is still pending. But we do have a verbal agreement. He'd be an idiot to pass up that much cash. It's way above asking price. But why would you do that? It's an investment opportunity. And it didn't hurt that it eliminated... certain distractions. You did this on purpose to get back at me for leaving. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Ivy. I didn't do this to get back at you. I did it to get you back. It's a win-win situation for everybody involved. Oh, it's go time! Remember, big smiles! [crowd cheering] [chanting] Ivy! Ivy! Ivy! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Karina? - Karina! - Sorry, sorry. What are you doing here? Well, I came to get my album signed. Duh! But, no, you left without saying goodbye. Yeah, I did. I screwed everything up. I... I just needed to leave town. You didn't screw anything up! Are you kidding me? You made our lives so much better! You made my life better too. And Darren misses you, you know. - Really? - He misses you a lot. Is that why you came here? Uh, sort of. But, mostly, because you didn't finish the song. And it is bad luck not to finish a song on the instrument you started it on. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Just finish it. Jamie needs to finish it. It's not my song. It's our song. And I can't finish it without you. So, here, take this. Get in. Get in the car. Ivy! What is this? Where are you going? You don't have to worry about it anymore. You can't just take the limo! Why can't I? I paid for it, didn't I? Ivy, why are you doing this? Because I make my own decisions now, okay? And, Naomi, you're fired! Driver? Take us to Deer Falls! [Radio] More bizarre behavior from pop star, Ivy Rose, who left last night's album signing without even making it in the door. Double cheeseburger, cheesy fries and a cola, right? It's really good to see you, Ivy. Thank goodness. I thought you were going to be mad. No. Look, what happened to you wasn't fair. I came in here and I forced my way into your life because I wasn't happy with my own. I'm really glad you did. It was fun and unpredictable and it gave me hope. I think that I was just so used to being let down that I just panicked and snapped myself out of it. I get it. I really do. And I am ready to do everything that I can not to let you down. You won't have to do that. I want to. For starters, I fired my manager, Naomi. - What? - Yeah. It turns out she was the one that was buying your store. Yet another way I was screwing up your life. I can't let you sell the store, Darren. Look, I know it can be scary, but that's the amazing thing about taking chances. Like you said, the store, it's a part of you. It's time to stop giving pieces of ourselves away to people who don't deserve them. You're right. I have made three very impulsive decisions as of late, but... all of them have led me straight to you. Oh, when you say it like that, it sounds downright consistent. But nothing about what I'm about to say is impulsive. Darren... I want to be here... with you. I want you to be here with me. That's even better than our first kiss.
