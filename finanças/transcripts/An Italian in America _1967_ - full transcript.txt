Tire pressure checked. Water and oil, all good. A nice cleaning for the windows. That's 3000 exactly, Sir. Here you go. There, thank you. Thank you very much. Come forward please! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? - Giuse', this man was looking for you in Calcata. He couldn't find it, so I showed him. Who is he? - This is Giuseppe. Can I come in for a moment? Please come in. - Thank you. Who is he? He's an American. I think a cop. He wants to interrogate you. What did you do? - Me? Nothing? He said it was serious, important. If you need a character witness, I'm ready. A character witness for what? What do you want, please? Well, my name is John Collins and I've been sent to you from the American Embassy here. We want to ask you a few questions. But first, what's your full name, please? Giuseppe Marossi. Where were you born? At Calcata, June 15th, 1930. Papa and mama? - The late Lando and Maria Peroni. Why do you say "late"? Are your parents dead? Yes, Sir. Mama died 10 years ago. - And your father? Papa died 30 years ago. I think. Why do you say "think"? Aren't you sure? No, Sir. Papa disappeared 30 years ago. And hasn't been seen since. - Really? Yes, Sir, I can attest to it. Keep quiet, you. - And keep it quiet. Shut up, OK? You haven't seen your papa for 30 years. Why do you say he's dead? If one hasn't been seen for 30 years, that means he's dead. No, Mr Marossi, your father isn't dead. Your father is alive and in the best of health. If you want, you can be with him once again. Would you like that? - Yes, Sir. You're not happy? I'm not happy? - You're not happy? I am happy but where is papa? He's in America and you can join him tomorrow in New York. In America? How can I do that? Do you have a passport? - Yes, Sir. I got it last year when I went with Aurelio to Lourdes. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party? Sir, let me be honest. I have only one friend in my life and it's him. He's a communist. Aurelio, can I tell him? - Tell him. Are you ashamed? You see, Sir, I'm a painter in my spare time. To make Aurelio happy, I painted the Communist HQ in Calcata. Just one window. What did the fresco depict? Garibaldi on horseback with Anita dying. We Americans appreciate fairness very much. You've been very fair with me, Mr Marossi. - Thank you. Now, it's all been taken care of: ticket, visa. You can get your vaccination at the airport. When you arrive, you'll be taken by helicopter and will land on the roof... of the American Television ASA Corporation Building. Got it?? What? It's the TV studio where you'll meet your father. I'll meet my papa on the TV? Why? Because at the reunion, you'll be seen by 30 million American viewers. 30 mill? Why should they care? Don't say that, Giuseppe. You don't know. You don't know America. Excuse me, Sir. - May I use the telephone? Please, at your disposal. - Thank you. Hello? American Embassy? Yes, I'd like to speak to Alice. Thanks a lot. Aure'? What? Am I dreaming? No, Giuse', it's really true. You found him. You found your father. I found papa? What shall we do, Aure'? I need to pack. Leave it to me, Giuse'. What'll you bring? That nice suit, the blue one with the matching shoes. It's ugly but it'll be fine for America. Take this trench hat as a gift. It's cold in America. It always snows. Your beret! What about you? - I don't need it, Giuse'. I've been meaning to let my hair grow. All done. - Yes? All done. - Thank you very much. Ah, you do speak English, Giuseppe. Just a little, about my job, Sir. - Bravo. Very good. Thank you. Tomorrow then at 3, an Alitalia employee will come by to pick you up to bring you to the airport. - Yes, Sir. I recommend that you be on time. - On time. Goodbye, Giuseppe. Buon viaggio. Give my best to daddy. Yes. - Goodbye, congratulations and good luck. What can I say? You're very nice and generous.

Hear those sirens? What is it? Police. Yes, Papa, two policemen stopped them by the bridge. Good! How come? - How come? For speeding. What about us then? Even if they wanted to, they couldn't do it now. Really? Why? - Because we're in another state. Good. We're saved. - See? New Jersey. Now, you'll drive. - Me? Why? Don't you have a license? - What? I've done it my whole life. Then you drive because I can't. - Why? Some years ago, I had some trouble with the State Police. Here every state does its own thing. - Yes, Papa. I can take off this trench coat. - There you go. Hey, there! Let's go. There, shall we go, Papa? - Go! Hey, did you touch the break? Touched the break? I barely grazed it! What a break! Of course. Hello, operator. I would like Los Angeles, 442-5207. Thank you. Papa, there's a phone in the car? And you can talk? There's no need to get out. - Fantastic! Hello! Is that Donnie Chu? How are you? Marossi! How's the queen? Good, I will be there as soon as possible. I will drive night and day. I can close the deal immediately! How much money do we have? - Huh? How much change do we have? - Change? 9000 dollars. I can give you 1000 cash and the rest with the check. Tell me, do you think that's OK with the queen? Great. There is something for you too, Donnie Chu. Goodbye. But who is that Donnie Chu? - Banana's Chinese lawyer. Banana? Who's Banana? A story from long ago: a Hawaiian queen fell in love with me. I met her in Honolulu and brought her with me to Hollywood. I gave her a part in my film. - What film? "Hawaiian Love." What? Were you an actor? - 5 years in Hollywood, in romances. That poor Jean Harlow died in my arms. Didn't you know? - I know nothing about you, Papa. I went into cinema as a lark and became the highest paid actor there. I always played the Latin lover in a tails and Banana lived with me. We bought a small house. In time, the land proved to be one of the richest oil fields in America. The old lady didn't use it and wanted to go home. So she gave it to me, at the price I paid for it 30 years ago. Why did she do that? She's Hawaiian, my boy, and has always loved me. Hot damn, Papa! Behold the King of Wells! The oldest of oilfields! Look at it: It's been working for 50 years. It never stops. Let's get out. I want to say hello. Stop. - Yes, Papa. What are you doing? Crying, Papa? - Yes, my son. I love this creature more than my own life. One day, you'll love it too. Yes, Papa. You see, Giuseppe, whoever owns one of these wells can consider himself the luckiest man in the world. Why, Papa? Because every time that arm goes up and down, 5000 lire go into the owner's pocket. And it always goes up and down? It never stops? Never. In the day, in the night, at all times. In peace, war, Christmas, Easter, while you sleep, while sitting in your yacht, while you make love, it never stops It's faithful and always here. It works and produces for you. 5. 10. 15. Keep counting. 20. 25. 30. 35. 40. 45. 50. 55. - See? You already earned 55. More, Papa? - Now you can stop. 60. - Let's go see Banana. This is it, Giuseppe. This is the house, see? Pay attention. Look all around. What does it look like to you? A flowering garden? No. Under your feet, there's gold. Black gold. Black gold? Oh, God, who's that? That's her. The Queen Banana. Aloha, your majesty! Aloha! Are you giving the fascist salute? - Hush, stop criticizing and say hello. Come! Come here! Get moving. Mandolino! Mandolino! Banana! - Aloha! My son, Giuseppe. Giuseppe! Aloha! And Donnie Chu! Come. Move it. "Cuka" dollar? "Cuka", fish out the money. - Yes, "cuking." Here it is. Take it. Here you go: 8000 cash? and 10,000 with a check. "Cuka." "Cuko." Here you go. "Cukato." The contract. What is it, Papa. - Don't ask, just drink. Not all of it. Leave some. What do we do now, Papa? - What do you think? Eat. Banana! That's how she seduced me 30 years ago. You like that? Papa, it turns me off. - What do you know? Papa, we're in Hollywood! These are the houses of the famous actors, Papa? Yeah. What a paradise! Did you live here too? - No, in the hills. Really? - The finest house in Hollywood. Boy, who knows what it's like to live here. Did you see the contract? It's made out in your name. In my name? - Yes, I want to create a happy and independent life for you. Thank you, Papa. Thanks a lot. I never imagined as a gas attendant, I'd be the owner of an oil well. 3 oil wells. - 3?

She's 2 meters long and alone in the world and likes me a lot. Are you dumb? She led you on! No, Papi, don't say that! - Listen, where's the money? Giuseppe, leave and escape! - Why should I escape? Stop asking me questions! If I say escape, escape! Somebody wants $10,000 and you must get out right away! And where'll I go, Papi? - Crazy Cat, San Antonio, Texas. Repeat it. Crazy Cat in San Antonio, Texas. Leave the hotel. Across the street is a bus stop. Take the Greyhound for San Antonio. You understand? I'm leaving by car right away. Yes. - Hello, Papi.

Thank you! - What? Thank you, Giuseppe! Oh, God, they've killed me? with punches? My head! Look, they left me some change. Damn thieves? But where am I? Where am I going now? Where the heck is Texas? San Antonio? Stop! Here we go again: another blow! Excuse me. - Yeah? I go to San Antonio. - Yeah? Crazy Cat to San Antonio. I go to my father. - Yeah? How much it cost?

Excuse me, do you know Mr Marossi? Excuse me. Do you know Mr Marossi? Hey! Are you looking for Mr Marossi? Yes, you know? - Mr Marossi is my father. I'm Giuseppe. - Yes! Mr Marossi is my father. But you're Giuseppe, my brother. - Who are you? I'm Pamela, your sister. My sister Pamela? Yes, your sister. I'm very happy to meet my Italian brother. The pleasure is all mine but? you're naked. But this my job, Giuseppe, I work for myself and for my husband. What does your husband think of your dancing nude? - He's pleased. He goes to college, university. And one day, when he becomes a great scientist, he'll have tons of millions and we'll go to California. And what will you do in California? California is the place to live for those who have many dollars. Everybody who lives there is very rich. And we'll have a large villa, a pool, furs, diamonds, cars and many servants! We'll live like millionaires and we'll be happy forever. This is America, Giuseppe! Do you know how much I make? No. 60 dollars a day. I'll become rich very soon. You see? Yes, I see but you're naked. Why do you always say I'm naked? You give that way too much importance. My husband and I never think badly of it. We're happy. But you're Italian. You can't understand? I can't. Where's papa? Papi is in the beauty shop. Can I leave my suitcase? - Of course, Giuseppe. And how do you get to the beauty shop? - Down there, on the floor beneath. Goodbye. Ciao. Ciao! Who do you want? - Eh? Mr Marossi. Who is Mr Marossi? Mandolino, you know. - Ah, Mandolino. Excuse me, Mr Marossi. - Here you are, Sir. Excuse me, Mr Marossi. Mr Marossi. 46. I got you again. - Again! Excuse me, do you know Mr Marossi? Giuseppe! Hey, Giuseppe! - Who are you? Papa, what are you doing? - Can't you see what I'm doing? Eh, I see it. - What did you do to yourself? What I did? What they did. Did you meet your sister? - Yes, I met her. Cute, eh? Sure, of course she is. Even Greta worked here but she left. Who's Greta? - What do you mean? Your younger sister. Now we've lost her. She no longer needs us. She is among the loveliest women in America. They call her "the body", il corpo. You invest in all your kids and then they leave you. Why stand there like a statue? Come and sit next to me. Come. Get yourself a mask. Go on. - What mask, Papa? I'd be ashamed. How about 23-25? - I got you, four 9s. She's diabolical, this brunette. Didn't I win 50 dollars for you? She wiped me out. What is it? It's an American game. Dollar poker, liar's poker. It's like regular poker. Who has the highest combination wins. Gimme a dollar. Dollar? I don't even have a cent. - No? And the $10,000? I don't know. They took it and killed me with punches. Giuseppe, what do you mean? You'll ruin me! I ruin you? - Oh! I signed a check! If by Monday, I don't have money in the bank, I lose the well and go to jail. Jail? Here they put you in jail if you sign a bounced check. I know, but don't you have a depository in the bank? Me? A depository in the bank? I make my money circulate. I don't keep it immobilized. What will we do? - Yeah, what will we do? What will we do, Joseph? What will we do, Papa? - Hold on, let me think. You see, Giuseppe, at this hour, Americans are locked in their homes in front of the TV. They're a good people, fair, honest, without imagination, without malice. See, they leave everything unwatched. Look! Look at that shop full of things. There's a treasure inside. See, what did I tell you? Pearls, diamonds, emeralds, all by themselves with nobody to guard them. There's not even a policeman about. Like I said: people without malice. One just needs to smash this window and take a handful of this stuff and we'll be all settled. Hey! HEEEEEEY! Don't raise your hands to your father who brought you to America! Don't make me regret it! You had me to come to America not to see me but to get the $10,000 prize and they you gambled it all away! You spoke of millions of dollars but you don't have even a lira! You're full of debts! Everybody's after you! I'll show you how in 2 hours I can reverse this situation! What situation, Papa? You're just a crazy person! The one you said is my sister is completely naked, has a husband in college and talks of villas, pools and jewels! She's delusional! Papa, being an American doesn't make you a billionaire! You hafta have billions or else you're crazy! No, we're not crazy! We're not delusional! This is reality. I have a friend in Texas who used to beg. In 3 months, he became a billionaire! Rockefeller! I told you how he started out. And Morgan and Ford and all of them. How did they become billionaires? With ideas. Why are you talking about Morgan, Ford, Rockefeller? It's not true! They're all stories you've made up! What are you saying? What's in your head? They were wealthy. You're just poor! You wanted to break a window! You wanted to steal! How shameful, I'm going back to Italy. What? You're here and you want to go back to Italy? Giuseppe, you have a villa on the Mississippi, an established restaurant, and oil wells! Sooner or later, won't they be yours? Thank goodness, I have the return ticket. - Can I see it? Papa, I don't believe in anything anymore. I'm going back to Italy. I'm sorry, Papa. I was happy to be in America but now I'm afraid. In Italy, at least I had a job, work. Papa, I was a gas attendant but I was happy. I never thought about billionaires, oil wells. Goddamn it! Papa! You disappeared? Papa! Pamela, have you seen Papa? He took my ticket and disappeared. Yes, he left you this ticket. He said for you to wait at his house in Memphis. What? Damn it! Is there something I can do? Yes. Get dressed. Excuse me, you go to Memphis? - Sure, come on up. May I? Thank you. Thank you, cowboy. Thank you. There. Try to figure out these Americans. That one has a house and he didn't even stop. You live in Memphis? You know Lando Marossi? He's my papi. He has a villa on the Mississippi. - Yeah, I know. And an Italian restaurant. - Uh, huh. Much money, papi. Yeah, I know. I was lucky to meet you, cowboy. This is a big car and it's fast too. What's that? - Here we are. Am I there? - Right there. - Good. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Just give me a little push. Push? Right away. There. I should have walked. "Lena and Lando Marossi?. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Ah, excuse me, Madame. Sam, what are you doing? - I'm just sweeping up but I'll go right after to the gas station, I was aiming to fix me a hamburger for breakfast. Madame. - I'm sorry about the water. No, no, it's nothing. Excuse me, Madame, I saw the writing outside. Do you know Mr Marossi? Lando Marossi? Mandolino? Are you Italian? - Mandolino, yes. Who's Lena? My sister. Who are you? Giuseppe, Mandolino's son. - Oh, Giuseppe. I saw you on television. You were a very handsome gondoliere. I was expecting you. I knew you'd come. Who told you? - Your father. Mio papi? Is he here? He went to the Kentucky Derby. He said to forgive him if he ran away with your ticket but he couldn't explain it and you wouldn't have understood. But he said he'd be back soon. And you'll be happy because you'll become rich if he wins. And if he doesn't win? - What do you mean? I said if he doesn't win? - Impossible. In this restaurant, he heard my sister Lena sing and he brought her to Chicago to make her sing at the Opera. And is this his restaurant? - It was his. He lost it playing poker with my mother. - Figures. And the villa on the Mississippi? - Oh, that's his. There it is across the street. Which one? The one with the columns? Can I go in? - Of course. Giuseppe. - Eh? If you need anything, come here to me. Thank you, Madame. Thank you very much. Call me Evelyn, if you like. - Thank you, Evelyn. Bye. - See you later. Ciao. Judy is 3 years old and Bev is almost 5. They're all that's left of my family. Peter, my husband, wanted to get divorced 3 years ago. My mother is dead. My sister Lena is now a famous singer thanks to your father. She doesn't come back to Memphis. I'm alone here with Old Sam. Are you good? How cute? It's destiny. And haven't I lived alone for 30 years? Poor Giuseppe. - What "poor Giuseppe"? You see, I was happy in Italy, Evelyn. But did I ever think I could come to America and be reduced to this? What do you think? - Don't you like America? I don't know. I liked coming to America but now that I'm here, I don't understand squat. Everybody here talks about millions, billions. Yet I don't have a cent, I'm hungry. It's been 2 days since I've eaten. Giuseppe, you haven't eaten? - No. I didn't know. I'll get you something. What do you want? Whatever you can: an egg, some soup. Sam! A car! Sam is never at the pump! Evelyn! I'll go. Good morning, Sir. How many gallons? 5 gallons. - Yes, Sir. How much? - 1.50, Sir. Keep the change. - Thank you, Sir. Thank you very much! Evelyn, a half dollar in tip! Oh, Giuseppe, you're a whiz! You're better than Sam. It's my work. I've done it all my life. Fantastic. Giuseppe, listen to what I say. Why don't you stay here? Sam is old. He can't work anymore. You can work the gas pumps and I'll work the restaurant. This way we wouldn't be so alone. You mean it for real? - Of course. Come on, Giuseppe. Keep the chewing gum, OK? - Thanks, Giuseppe. Good evening. How many gallons? - Fill it up, please. Full? - That's right. Hi, Officer, how are you? Fine, how are you yourself? - Fine. Hot enough here for you? It's very warm in this country, eh? Hey, Giuse'. Papa? Papa, what are you doing there? What happened? It's because of that check! Giuseppe, just think I almost had a double win of $30,000. I'm sorry. - Don't worry! It's only 3 months. And besides, American prisons aren't anything like the Italian ones. You're good there: they're modern, attractive, with every comfort. You won't be able to gamble? - What do you mean? There's the TV. And if you send me a few dollars, I might be able to leave with a ton of money. You'll see, Giuse'. - Yes, Papa. Bravo! I see you're in uniform. See? You've already found a job. You have before you a great future. You'll see! That's how I started out. You like the villa? Yes, it's nice. There's a fine view. You can see the Mississippi. The land all around it is all mine. What land? It's all swamp. Officer, my son Giuseppe. Hi, Giuseppe. - Hi. You see how nice they are to me? - Yes, I see. Where do I write you? It's very easy: Lando Marossi, San Quentin Prison. Yes, Papa, I'll write you. Rest. Don't overwork yourself. Ciao, Giuseppe. 10 dollars. - Ah, Giuseppe! Thank you, friend. Yes? Tell me, Papa. Don't sell it. Sell what? The land around the villa. Don't be upset that it's a swamp. Underneath it, is all petroleum. Yes, Papa. Bye. Bye, Papa! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
