(fire crackling) (kids chattering) (tense music) - One, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four, knock on the door. Five, six, pick up sticks. Seven, eight, lay them straight. Nine, ten, big and fat. 11, 12, dig it down. 13, 14, made for court. 15, 16, made for kitchen. (intense music) - Sweetheart why are we having this conversation? Nobody's gonna care if it's zucchini or yellow squash or cantaloupe. Yeah that's fine, I don't care. (loud thudding) (groaning) (ominous music) - Can I see your resume? Look I appreciate your interest but most of our employees here are kids. - I understand that. - And our pay's minimum wage. - Somethin' better than nothin'. - Then there's the matter of this. There's a 25 year gap on your resume. What've you been doing for the lat 25 years? Thanks for coming in, okay. - How's that sound? - [Man] Sounds okay, thank you. - Good. Do me a favor, fill this out, take this back to the office. - [Man] Thank you. - Thank you. Ah shit, Roach. I heard you were out. How in the hell are you buddy? - I'm alright I guess. - Good. It's good to see you man, you fuckin' look good. Come on back. Look who I found. - Roach. - Nowadays a guy like that comes in here and pawns off a precision sports car his daddy gave to him lying on his deathbed and hoping he'll use the money to turn his life around. A guy likes you gets in the pinch. Shit you just yank the keys out of his motherfuckin' hand. Am I right Roach? - Cut it out guys. I've been a pretty good friend to you guys. - Sure you have Roach. - When I went away, I didn't take anyone with me. - Ah we know, we know, nobody's disputing that. Did you not believe us when we said thank you Roach? - No I did. It's just that um. - What? - I was hoping to get a little bit of product, you know, 'cause of everything that's happened. (laughing) - Alright why didn't you just say so Roach. Think we can afford you a little bit of personal celebration. Give me a bag of that stuff. Now this stuff is pretty high grade unlike that stepped on filth we were circulating before you went in. - This is it? This is all I get? - Excuse me? - Look I mean no disrespect Bobby, but I'm looking to deal a little bit of product on my own, you know. Help get me back on my feet. - Aw come on Roach, if I give you anymore than that you're seriously cutting into my profit margin. - I can pay. $300. - $300 doesn't go very far when you're talking about bricks for distro Roach. Ah fuck, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you something less than top shelf for the $300, okay? It's good weight too. Give him some of that product we got from Lopez's men. Now this shit, this shit's gonna pucker your asshole. - Pucker your asshole. - Thanks for this. - Hey no problem. Hey man this um, this squares us up right? - Of course. - Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna hear anymore bullshit about how I owe you for whatever happened to us in the past. You understand me? I didn't get you caught. You got you caught. - I got you, fair enough. - Good. It's good to see you Roach. One way or another that'll get that motherfuckin' asshole out of our hair. - Yes sir. - Well it ain't like prison, that's for sure. In prison I worked the library for awhile. - I know Dad. - Mailroom some. - [Daughter] Yeah I know Dad. - Even for the Warden once. Wasn't nobody questioning my resume or calling up references. It was easy. Life was good. Not a lot of struggling at a job and making sure I could cover the cost of keeping a roof over my head or three square meals a day. It was all just there. - Without freedom. And you know I saw your halfway house on the news. - Ah it's a new one. New stuff always draws the controversy. - Well they said they put a pedophile in the house with you. Is that true? Is there a child molester living in the house with you Daddy? - Well I seriously doubt he's inclined to make a move on me at my age. - Yeah but Daddy this is not a joke. That's residential area. There's a ton of children out there. - Calm down baby girl, he's monitored. - Seriously Daddy, we've gotta get you out of there. We want you to come stay with us. Look I know one of your goals is to find suitable residence, but we have that here for you. - I'm not gonna be a burden. Not on you. - You're not a burden, you're my Daddy. - There are other considerations. - We want you here with us. We love you Dad. - I know baby girl, I know. - [Radio Preacher] He has uncovered his father's nakedness, both of them shall surely be put to death. - You are spurned. You will be damned in hell. The blasphemous beast rises and the evil shall be cast out. - Good morning to you too Miss Rosie. You doddering piece of shit. (ominous music) Eh it is what it fuckin' is. Shit. - Damn burnout, you look like you're jonesing hard. - Fuck you Emilio. - What'd you say to me. - Leave me alone. - Hey, hi Cliff. - Micheal, hi. Got your message but uh. - Yeah Cliff I'd like to introduce you to Marilyn LaRue. - Marilyn, my pleasure. Why don't you two just join me in my office. - Damn that's a nice piece of ass right there. - Okay. So what's going on? - You got my message. - Well your message was brief and clearly didn't reveal the whole story. - Marilyn is your newest guest here. - I do hope you're shitting me. (car horn honking) - Hey Emilio, where's Cliff? - He's in the office bro with some sweet ass bitch. - Good. What's the matter with you burnout? - Oh he's just jonesing man. - How many days has it been? How many? - Why, are you gonna call me a burnout again? - Ah give it up Jake. Look I got something for you that'll help you out. Come with me. - Fuck it, right? - Yeah. - Come on don't give me that horseshit about how you and I have a relationship. I can make the same damn noise. Plus there's a ladies halfway house not even a 40 minute drive from here. - We've been through that entire rigamarole. From the chaperone up to the state and back down. That was all day yesterday for us. Now they're here with you. - To a men's house? - Marilyn is preoperative. - Oh nice work so far. - Diet, exercise, and hormones. Lots of hormones. - Even so, why would her being up there be disruptive to other women? - The ladies house doesn't allow anyone with a cock. - Oh they haven't seen one up there? - The state is pretty rigid mixing the sexes in their correctional facilities, you know that Cliff. - It was the same during my sentencing. - Oh men's prison? That must've been rough. - Sometimes the state has very little give. - Oh Michael this isn't right. I mean I know Marilyn needs this little place to live, but this is a new house. I'm still trying to get these guys to step right. They still function under prison rules. No cell phones, no contrabands, no conjugals. This ain't gonna do a goddamn thing to help. Besides I'm just not up to it. - Cliff, I'm not asking your permission. (sighing) - I gotta go somewhere. Today's your lucky day. (ominous music) - Holy shit. - Right? - But you know I'm giving it up. - No, no, sure, I understand. But maybe just a little bit you know, help you get through that rough patch. - A little. - Yeah just a little bit. Going cold turkey sucks. Plus it's not proven very effective, you know. You gotta step it down a bit. - Well um, how much will you give me? - Give you, shit I'm not giving this away. I'll let a pinch go for a C note. - $100? - That's my wholesale price. - I haven't got it. - Well how much have you got? - Nothin'. - Nothin'? You got no money? Shit what happened? Lemme guess, you went through your prison stash and you blew it already, huh. Is that what happened? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, just. I'm good for it. - Yeah I don't give credit. But I'll tell you what. I'm sure we could work something out. (laughing) - Oh hey Clarence. I want you to meet Marilyn. - How you doing? - She's gonna be staying with us for awhile. - Everybody calls me the mailman. - Then I will too. - Got the first day jitters. - A little. - Cliff's a good man, he'll keep you pointed right. Excuse me. - Alright Clarence. Make yourself at home Marilyn. - Call me if you need anything, okay? - Mm hmm. - Sup legs? Welcome. - Thanks. - God damn suck that cock you fucking bitch. Oh god you're a fucking bitch, good. Suck that cock. (mellow music) Suck that shit bitch. God damn. (heavy breathing) Oh shit. Suck that cock you fucking faggot. Swallow that shit. God suck it all bitch. You must've been the bell of the ball in prison. - Come on man, don't use. - What'd you say? - Can I have my stuff now? (laughing) - I will say this, if you ever wanna do business again, you just let me know. - Fuck you. (laughing) - [Radio Preacher] You shall consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy for I am the lord your God. You shall keep my statutes and practice them. I am the lord who sanctifies you. If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother he shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. - You pedophile. Burn in hell pedophile, die. God will punish you. You pedophile, God will punish you. - Frank. - [Frank] Cliff. - Hey guys, get down here. - I'll be right down. (ominous music) - Gentlemen, this is Marilyn. She's gonna stay with us for awhile like the rest of you until she secures permissible work and suitable living arrangements. You know Clarence. And you've met Emilio. That's Frank standing right beside you there. - Hi. I'm Frank the pedophile. Does that make you nervous. - No, I'll survive. - And this is Jake. - Burnout. - And there's Rodney. - Call me Roach and may I just say damn. - True that. - Roach no reason to sit down. Get up, go with Emilio up to your room, get the shit out of you room, put it in his and Jake's. - What? - Look Marilyn gets a single room to herself. Do I have to explain this to you mooks. - Yeah but why do I gotta have his stink ass in my room? - Hey fuck you hombre. - It's not up for debate, it's been decided. Let's go. - God dammit Cliff. - Wouldn't be a bad idea just to let her move into my room. You know I'd make room for her, I would even more over just a little bit. - [Radio Preacher] Our homes are our sanctuary. Our neighborhoods are our sanctuary and our sanctuary has been encumbered by the presence of evil. And that is something that the lord does not want for you. - Amen to that reverend. Amen. - Can you believe we got that hot fucking piece of ass in the house? - Ain't you married? - What's that gotta do with fucking? Oh shit. New wallets? - Sorta. - Hey do you still have the credit cards and IDs in them shits? - I do. - Dude you gotta take the scissors from downstairs and cut them shits up. - I was gonna do that. - Uh huh, but? - But I wanted to talk to you about that. - Oh yeah? - You got any wetback connections? Maybe we can give some of these to your spic friends who might need 'em, you know? Cut out some of the photos, got yourself a whole new batch of gringos. - Um maybe I'll look into that. - Any action that comes from you we split 50/50, cool? - Alright. - Alright. - Put them shits away though. - [Roach] Yep. - What? What's up Chuck E Cheese? - Answer the man. - Hey what's up little kiddie fucker. - Look man, I'm getting therapy. - Shut the fuck up. (laughing) Think I want you in this house? - [Frank] Just let me go, just let me go. - [Roach] Fuck you, I ain't letting shit go. Fucking piece of shit. (men mumbling) - I got a daughter bitch, we should cut your fucking dick off. - Hey! Who messed up my stuff? - What? - Who messed up my stuff? - What the fuck you talking about, Mailman? - My stuff is all messy. - So maybe you're just an old sloppy geezer. - [Roach] Fuck off old man. (coughing) - Hey Cliff, there's something going down up there. Jesus Cliff are you okay? (coughing) - Motherfucker don't eyeball me like we're in the motherfucking yard. - Somebody's gonna tidy up the mess that was made in my room. - Oh we look like a fuckin' maid service to you? - I don't think I'm talking to both of ya. So let me ask you this, did you go in my room? - Fuck no. What business I got in that room with you and that fuckin' child molester. - I didn't think so. Then you. - Fuck off old man, I was moving my shit with the spic the whole time. - Full of that. Right afterwards you did it in here. - Fuck off. - Let me tell you somethin' son. I've been in prison on and off for the last 25 years and in all that time ain't nobody ever punked me out. Can you say the same? - And that means what? That you think you could stand up against me? - Just you? - Oh don't look at me, my name's Paul, this is between y'all and shit. - And you. I think I could hold my ground here. - Go fuck yourself you old nigger. I ain't about slapping down the elderly, but you watch your goddamn words with me. Come on Emilio. - So you like to keep it neat. Like prison. - Only way to do it. - Hey princess. Your room's almost ready for you, but it just needs one more thing. - What's that? - Me baby. - Get back. I'm not your toy. Excuse me. - You're excused. (ominous music) - Okay everybody, meeting time. - [Emilio] Woohoo. - Frank, Clarence, kid, let's go. - Well it must be time for counseling. Let's go Mailman. - [Cliff] Very good Frank. - Oh how nice. The pedophile has a heart. - Okay guys. So Marilyn, one of the things we do here is we counsel each other. We're um, for lack of a better word, a family. Now I know most of you haven't been in that family scenario for quite a while and if and when you ever were it pry wasn't quite ideal. But families support each other and that's what I want for us here. Look getting back into the world, it's pretty easy to regress back to old patterns. Especially if you're stepping back into the same environment which creates the same old realities. You are halfway. You are not on one side, you are not on the other. You're halfway between prison and the free world. But you get the choice which way you go and when. So remember, people, places, things. Step right. Anybody? - Alright I'll go first. You know I generally agree with Cliff but he's mostly interested in how do we adapt to the world without too much noticing that the world don't want us in it. I'll admit I don't always understand how things work out here, how to function. But I do know how to exist in prison. Got that much down. - Come off it old man, I mean is it tough? Is it a grind? Yeah. But we got it over your average citizen easy. Shit we get a bus pass, we can move around like anybody, do anything we want. But none of them understand at all how to survive where we fucking been. I think that makes us better than them. - It's easy enough to be swallowed up in either place. - Swallowed up huh? Swallow it up good huh? (yelping) - Shut the fuck up Rodney. Rodney shut the fuck up, leave him alone. You okay? You look like you might be comin' down off something. - Burnout. Burnout. - Burnout. Burnout. - Shut the fuck up. Are you working the program man? - No, I uh. I haven't found a convenient meeting yet. - I think prison's all around us. I felt an isolation long before I was even sentenced. - Yeah but you didn't stay isolated enough did you? - It's 'cause he's a fucking perv. - You're right Roach. You're right Emilio. But we're all prisoners inside. Whatever hand life has dealt us, it's led us to this point. I mean we still carry around everything. All that baggage that made us who we are and what we are. And we just can't Gatsby our way out of it. I mean we still carry everything that made you do what you do. Made you deal drugs. - Allegedly fucker. - Gatsby, what the fuck is a Gatsby? - The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald. It's a novel about a man who wanted to change his identity so he could have a new beginning. - Anyway fuck that, I wanna know about our newcomer. - Seems like I'm the object of some curiosity. - Oh you know that. - Tell us about you. - Well just like you mentioned, Frank I'm looking for a new beginning. Prison was pretty hard for me. Real hard time. As I'm sure it was for some of you. And the reality of that I don't wanna carry around but I have to. I can never put it behind me. I don't ever wanna go back, not even for a single day. My worst days on the outside were still far better than any given day on the inside. No contest. I'm not the same person I was. Now I'm ready for a fresh start. - Great first session Marilyn. We're gonna get you well down the path of the straight and narrow. - Like I say, I don't wanna go back. - That's right. Jake. We have got to get this NA meeting schedule down. It's gotta become routine, okay? - Yeah. - You tell me yeah? I see what's going on in your face. Do you wanna get on the other side of these urges or not? - More than anything I know. - Start taking the steps. Hey don't give me that bullshit about the meetings being inconvenient. I gave you a shit load of meetings on this bus line. Damn man I'm not saying it's not hard. I know for a goddamn fact that it is. Look at me. You dig in and you do this and pretty soon you're gonna be on the other side of these urges. Okay? - Okay Cliff, I will. I really will, I promise. - Okay kid. * On the day of the rapture * I was sitting on the couch * Just strumming a song, I couldn't resist * Being so simplistic, simple chord * And the chorus * And this was the mix * When this hits * So I play up the board * On the day of the rapture * And I'm a human * Just having fun * Got a heart beating like a steady drum * You ah was always on time * We shared rocking arrested * And you were missed * When this hits * So I say it before to you * On the day of the rapture (coughing) - Hey let me help you with those. Sorry. Prison was rough huh? What'd you do to go in? - What'd you do? - Ah there was a dispute who run the small drug shipment. Somebody died, state called it manslaughter. - Oh I didn't kill anyone. - Hey it was a turf issue. Got outta hand plus, I was defending myself. - Really? - That's the way my lawyer put it, but I wanna know about you. - Well I didn't get in the system by hurting anyone, I used to make people feel good. - Wait a minute, shit, you were a pro? In that case you think maybe you could. - I'm outta that life. - Sure, but not to get back in the life, I meant, you know, just for me. - I got it from here. Thanks. - Got it? Yeah I'll hold that for you. I got you. Slow down. Well if there's anything you need. - I'll let you know. - Alright, anything at all baby. Shit. - Boom, not interested, rejected by a whore. - Hey, watch your fucking mouth, bro. - Alright come on. - Mark my words homie, I'm gonna tap that ass. One way or another, I'm gonna hit that shit. (laughing) What the fuck? - Oh god. God dammit. - [Radio Preacher] If there is a man who commits adultery with another man's wife, one who commits adultery with his friend's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely. - Mother fuck. Mother fuck. Motherfucker, god dammit. - Find anything good? - Nothing worth taking. Kept his old clippings. Looks like the painkillers got him started. - Fucking burnout. - Alright, let's go tell Cliff. - It is the guiding hand of the lord that has struck down the one. And I see six more who should prepare for damnation. God will smite thee. Thou sodomites. Thou acronites. - Nosy Rosie claims that Jake was smitten down by the lord our God. I think I wanna offer another conclusion. - [Rosie] No mercy, no mercy! Judgement from the lord. - Anybody see anything? - [Rosie] The halfway house is from hell! God will smite it down! You will be lost forever! Sinners, sinners, sinners. - Yeah, I thought as much. - The halfway house is from hell! God will smite it down. - We haven't even been open for a fucking month and already we have a probable overdose. Goddammit. - Judgement from the lord. - He was just a kid. (drills revving) - Well if it isn't Roach. - What's up Bobby. - Shit, you tell me. - Well that batch of product you sold me wasn't so good. Did you not hear me? - What are you gonna do about it Roach? - I don't know. Just give me my money back. - There ain't no customer service window for what you're talking about Roach. - A guy died. Come on man. When I went to prison I didn't squawk on you guys. I didn't take any of you fuckers with me. - And you got this ass backwards motherfucker. What you think you owed something because you didn't roll over and turn us in? Hmm? The truth is, the only reason why you're still fucking alive is 'cause you didn't fucking squawk. These books are balanced my friend. Any annoyance that you cause us now motherfucker requires an entirely new payment. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Get the fuck out of here. - Get the fuck off me. This is bullshit. This is fucking bullshit. Get the fuck off me. - Get the fuck outta here. (whistling) - [Theresa] Emilio. - Hi baby. - [Theresa] Baby. - Como estas. - It's so good to see you. - Good to see you too baby. - I missed you. - I missed you too. - I heard about the house. Are you okay? What happened? - Yeah just an overdoes I think. The cops came and took the guys shit for evidence. - Watch your language. - Oh hey mija. - Ayana. (speaking in foreign language) - Come give your Daddy a hug. - Ayana. - [Emilio] Come give your Daddy a hug. - Say hi to your daddy. - Hey. (speaking in foreign language) - Give her a break. She's gotta get to know you, okay? You want some breakfast? - Yeah. That's one of the two reasons I came over here. (giggling) So, you got school huh? What's your best subject mama? - Math. - Alright that's good mama. Hey Victoria's uncle's gonna let me work on the landscaping crew. - That's great news baby. Uh a job, thank god. - Yeah as soon as I get my first paycheck they should let me move back here. - Well God's been hearing my prayers babe. - Hey uh, we should celebrate. - Ayana, finish up your eggs baby okay? But don't be late for the bus. I love you. - Hey, I love you too okay? - Santiago got shot. - What? - [Theresa] Yeah. - What was he doing? - He was at his corner again. - Shit I was hoping things had cooled down by now. - If anything it's heating up again. - Well you know what, I don't wanna talk about it. (heavy breathing) - Emilio. - What baby? - I wanna make another baby. - What? - Yeah I wanna make another baby. I waited for you for so long, I just wanna make another baby. Having you back in my life is like starting all over again. And having another baby's like making it real, babe. Yeah? - Okay. (heavy breathing) (moaning) - Mommy, mommy. - Hey. What's wrong? Are you lost? - I can't find my Mommy. - Oh, what's your name? - Allison. - I'm Frankie. Would you like me to help you find your mommy? Okay. Let me take your hand. Let's go this way, okay? Alright. One, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four, knock on the door. Five, six, pick up the sticks. Alright. Seven, eight, lay them straight. Nine, ten, big and fat. 11, 12, dig and delve. Allison's mommy! Allison's mommy! Allison's mommy! Allison's mommy! Oh she was lost, I was just trying to help her. Alright, give me a big smile now, okay? (heavy breathing and grunting) (intense music) - Oh sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. Get away, get away. - [Doctor] Have you been keeping the schedule with your hormone therapy Mr. Evans. - Religiously doctor. - [Doctor] Good. But um, as for the procedure we discussed. - Uh huh. - [Doctor] I'm very sorry. As a result of your other complications it will not be possible to proceed any further with your reassignment surgery. - Oh. But I've been feeling really good and my medications are really working. - [Doctor] I'm sorry. Mr. Evans it will never be possible. (somber music) (sobbing) (people shouting) - Oh thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks. - Get out. - Oh it's very nice, very nice. - You convict. - Go the fuck home. - The wages of sin are death. - Fuck you, you dried up cunt. Yeah, what? (protestors shouting) And just what the fuck are you doing out here? - I'm just relaxing. - Oh just relaxing. I should stomp you in the grass and feed you to them. Oh don't mad dog me bitch. If you were in the joint with me, I woulda shanked you in the colo, fucking kiddie rapist. - That's exactly what I told them to do. I don't know why they didn't do it. - Yeah, me neither. But since it seems to be what everybody wants, maybe I'll finish the job. Sleep tight. - I try. I try. - Hello sweet thang. - Get out of here. - I'm just saying hi. - You need to respect my space and not get all up in my business. - I do, I do. - Get out. - Damn baby, thems a lot of pills. We just lost one for taking too much. I'd hate to see you go that way too. - Get out. - I've been meaning to ask you. How much did you used to charge? - Emilio get out. - How much? 'Cause I think we could come to an arrangement. - I'm outta that life. - Oh I know, I know, but you might need a little something extra in your purse every now and again. And I's sure as shit like to fuck your ass or your mouth. Or both. It's a win, win. - I'm sure your wife would love that. Go away. - So what? You're saying I ain't good enough for a whore. - Asshole. I'm not a whore. - Oh, don't get all stuck up and shit on me, 'cause we both know you ain't that. - You don't want what I have. - Oh I sure as shit do. Even if it's just a blow job. And I'd pay for it too, that is unless you keep teasing me with that sweet pussy. Then I just might have to take what's mine to have. - Get the fuck out! - I'm going, I'm going. Fucking whore. - Mother fuck, I almost shit my pants. - What are you a bitch now. - Yeah blow me. It's that crowd outside. - [Protestors] Burn in hell, burn in hell. - They got nothing better to do than just come here and fuck with us. We gotta move these IDs and credit cards asap. You got anyone we can sell to yet? - No man, but I'll get right on that though. - Yeah don't drag your feet. (protestors shouting) They're like roaches, more and more. - Yeah but they're all talk and no action, right. - Yeah so far. But I swear it's like they keep just gathering. Like they got nothing better to do than come here and fuck with us. (protestors shouting) - Just go away. Just go. - The blasphemous beast rises and the evil shall be cast out. - I thought you were Christians? You know turn the other cheek? All I asked was for another chance. A chance, that's it. Stop yelling, stop screaming at us. I can't take it no more. All I want is a chance, all I want is a chance to be one of you guys. Hey, hey. (loud thudding) - Hey what the hell are you doing? Leave him alone! Get away from him! Get away from him, what's wrong with you, get away from him! Come on, let's get, what are you doing? Get up, get up, get up. Goddammit. What are you doing out here? - You should be ashamed of yourselves. - Alright get inside Frank, get inside. - You will be written out of the book of life. - Okay we get it Miss Rosie, it's very clear you don't want us here. Please but you people are the only ones committing a crime here. - You don't belong around our children, get out! - Go back to your homes, write your congressman, bitch about it among yourselves. - Yeah fuck you. Fuck you man, get outta here. - Look see, just leave us alone. You're criminals. (protestors shouting) - You alright Cliff? - Get the fuck away from me Frank. - Look I never meant anything to happen to you. Please stop already! Just stop! - Alright, it's right over here. Alright so this one right here? - No that's the power. Here try this one, I think this is the phone line. - Why not power too? - Because we wanna be able to see 'em, but we don't want any of 'em calling the cops. - What about their emails or cell phones? - It's a halfway house, they can't have emails or internet here. Cut it. - Alright, alright. Here it goes. - Hey. Son of a bitch this damn phone. Hey, hello? - God they're driving me crazy out there. - Get the hell away from the window. From this point forward I don't want anybody going outside. - That's bullshit Cliff. - Come again? - We didn't all just get out of prison to be on lockdown in here and shit. - Alright okay, so just consider this your new curfew. From now it's at the time that any crowd shows up outside during the day time. - And what if we got a job prospect huh? - Cut the bullshit Roach, you know I'm gonna work with you. But can you not wrap that numbskull brain of yours around the fact that some unwanted shit's gonna go down if you go out there fucking around? - I say we send the kiddie fucker out there. He's the one that they really want, listen to 'em. - Yeah they probably wouldn't pay us any attention if the state didn't stick a fucking child molester in the neighborhood. - Shut the fuck up, both of you. - When in doubt, send in the sacrificial lamb, right boys. - I thought so. (loud thudding) - Motherfucker. I'll fix it Mailman, I'll fix it. - Motherfucker. If I wanted to, I could make you my bitch right now. You had that boy killed, didn't you? - That asshole got himself killed. - You a goddamn liar. I know you did it, and I outta kill you for it right now. - You do that, they put you inside forever and you know it. - You think that sounds threatening to me? Motherfucker I'm way better suited for prison life than street life. As a matter fact I'm rushing to return to the stir. Now fix it. Fix it, fix it, fix it, fix it. - Fix it yourself nigger. I'll fucking kill you bitch. Fuck you. - I know you did it motherfucker. (protestors shouting) - [Radio Preacher] For it is sinners who face retribution. Retribution at the hands of the lord. (coughing) - You need anything Cliff? I like to help out, really. - There's nothing that can be done. But Frank, thanks. - So what is it in your past? - Excuse me? - You mentioned at the orientation counseling session that we all have things in our past that have helped trigger us into who we've become. What's in your past? - It was all baseball and apple pie. - You know what? I wanna show you something. - Okay. - And that's me. - Cute kid. Is he yours? - That's me. That's me before. And this is me now. - Wow. Talk about making a change in your life. - It's not the complete change. That's never gonna happen for me. So I'm just sorta stuck in the middle, halfway between being either a man or a woman. - So you like men, women, or? - I went to the prom. - Prom. - I tried sex with girls 'cause that's what boys from the Midwest are supposed to do. But none of that seemed right. And several times along the way I thought the best way to deal with my personal peculiarity would be to kill myself. - Look, I don't know what you think you saw. - But I pushed through. And I know you can too. - I've tried killing myself. But I just haven't been able to go through with it yet. - Just like me. We have similarities. - What's hiding inside you is a beautiful woman. What's hiding inside me is a monster. And monsters must be slayed. Big difference. - You're not a monster through and through. I see your kindness, you just expressed it to Cliff. You express it a lot. - Anybody can help a sick, injured old man. But not everybody carries the evil I carry inside. It's better to lose both than to live with both. - I agree. But that can't be our only option. And like you said there's something in our past that triggered us to become who we are. For me it was my father. He was supposed to protect me from things like what he would do to me. At night when my mother was asleep he would come to my bed and wake me up. He'd ask me questions about school like he was trying to be a good parent. Then after the first time, I knew why he was there. He'd have me take off my own pajamas, tell me how pretty I was. And he'd play with my penis until it became hard. Then he'd take out his cock and rub it on me. And then he'd start. The bastard. - Did you report it? I mean did he go to jail for it? - You know I never, I never told anyone. I never even told my mom. - For me it was my mother. I was her little man after my father died. I was nine years old. It started out with me sleeping in her bed, 'cause she said the bed was just to big for her. Nine years old. The same age as my victims. She took away my innocence. She'd sing nursery rhymes to me while she did it so she wouldn't have to hear me cry. One, two, buckle your shoe. Three, four, knock on the door. Five, six, pick up the sticks. It's what exactly I do to little girls. The little girls that I touch. She used me, she terrified me. But I forgive her, but I forgive her. (sobbing) (protestors yelling) - Look we gotta get that pedophile outta here anyway we can. - You know it, come on. (gulping) - Hey I'm gonna go downstairs and check out the scenery. - You gonna go check on Cliff? - Yeah. - Frank, you keep being the good guy. Keep that monster deep down. - Okay. - [Roach] I'm telling you hombre, that fine ass bitch needs to be schooled. - [Emilio] Hey I even offered to pay for it, she wouldn't take it man. - [Roach] Fuck that, let's jump on that shit asap. - [Emilio] I'm down bro, I'm down. (protestors yelling) - Yes, yes. Burn them alive. - Hey sexy. - What are you guys doing? Hey could you leave the door open. - It's time for us to stop playing games. - Okay you guys don't know the whole story with me. - About how you need a hard Mexican cock to teach you a lesson? I think I do. - I'm not what you want. - Alright maybe you're not someone to take home to mama, but uh. - I just wanna be left alone. - Oh you're too beautiful for that. Oh you wanna go? Sure, soon. Soon enough. (screaming) - What? - She's got a dick man. (laughing) - What? Really? - Just get off me. Fucking A. - Fuck it, prison rules, it's on. (screaming) (loud thudding) - Hold the bitch down, hold the bitch down. (screaming) - Fuck that shit, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up. Come on fucking bitch, take it, hurry that shit. (grunting) (crying) (moaning) (screaming) - Hurry up, I want my turn motherfucker. (screaming) (protestors shouting) (loud banging) - [Cliff] Oh hey, Theresa. - Hey. - Hey it's good to see you. - How are you? - Good, I wish you wouldn't have come today though. - God it's crazy out there. - Yeah. - I tried calling but the phone is down. - Yeah they would turn the power off too if they didn't wanna see what we're doing in here. Remind me your name again. - Ayana. - Ayana. Hi Ayana. You get prettier everyday. Hey you guys wanna grab a seat over here, make yourself comfortable? - Where's Emilio? - He's upstairs, I'll get him. - Okay, let's go. - Okay. - Hey Emilio. (screaming) Hey Emilio, Theresa's here. - Shit, shut up. Shit Theresa's here man. Fuck. - [Roach] Wait, what? - Shut up. Theresa's here man, keep her quiet. - Bullshit, it's my turn. - Fuck! (crying) Keep her quiet. (slapping) Shut up! - Shut up, stop fucking moving. Stop fucking moving bitch. It's my turn now, huh. Stop fucking moving, this shit's gonna happen. - How old are you? - I'm eight. - Eight huh? I gotta granddaughter, but she's not quite eight yet. A little younger than you. - Theresa? - Hey baby. - You got through the crowd? - Yeah but we didn't know that they were there. Are they violent? - I dunno. They're just making noise, but you never know. - Give me a hug. - Okay. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good, I was just working out. (speaking in foreign language) - Well Ayana was doing her homework at her friends house and I picked her up after work and we got a bite to eat and I decided to swing by and say hi to you. - Oh cool. - I hope that's okay? - Naw it's great, it's just that you know, intense because, you know, all the noise outside. (screaming) - Shut the fuck up! (screaming) - Shut up! - Well the place is looking good. It's been taking nice shape since Emilio's moved in. You think I could see Emilio's room? - Sure. - Do you think I could see it for awhile? - A conjugal? - I don't think that's a good idea, I mean, there's something in the rule book right? - I think there's something in the rules somewhere but, eh, today's an unusual day. Go for it. - I'm ovulating. Ayana baby, you think you'll be okay there? - Yeah she'll be alright. We'll watch some TV, I'll get some refreshments. I'll be right back Clarence. - Theresa. (speaking in foreign language) - Bitch, shut the. Stop, stop fighting it bitch, this is happening. (crying) (groaning) - [Theresa] Oh you're all ready for me? - Oh yeah baby. - That's right, it's my turn now. Yeah. (loud thudding) (screaming) (loud thudding) (groaning) - One, two, three. Pay out! - Wait, wait, this is my favorite part. - Oh yeah. (groaning) You alright Cliff, you okay? You okay Cliff? Hey sit down here, sit down here. - There you go baby. Put a baby in me. Put a baby in me. There you go. (ominous music) (coughing) - Damn Cliff, you okay? Hey I'm sorry the phones are down, I can't call a doctor for you. - Doesn't matter, just check that drawer over there. - Self medicating, huh? Here you go. Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, I'm here. - Hi. - Hi. - It's okay, he's gonna be alright. He always bounces back. I'm Frankie. - I'm Ayana. - That's a beautiful name. - Thanks. - Are Emilio's daughter? Yeah? I seen pictures of you. You're much prettier in person. - Thanks. (speaking in foreign language) (grunting) - Don't fight it, this is gonna happen bitch. (intense music) (screaming) - You fucking bitch. (choking) - You know I'm a fortune teller. Yeah. Would you like me to read your fortune? Yeah? Can I see your hand? You see this line right here? This says you're gonna marry a prince. This line here says you're gonna be an awesome mommy. Oh this line says you're gonna be a movie star. Wow. What's in your backpack? - My books and pencils and my homework from school. - Oh yeah? What's your favorite book? - This one. - Oh, Pinocchio. I love Pinocchio. - I do too. - He's got a big nose. Do I have a bit nose? (giggling) How about this. I'm gonna go up to my room, would you come up and read some of Pinocchio to me? I really would love to hear the story of Pinocchio again. It's okay. - Okay. - Would you do that? Okay, let me have your hand. I'll take this. Come on. (coughing) (gasping for breath) - Five, six, pick up the sticks. Seven, eight, lay them straight. Nine, ten, shh. (whispering) Please sit down. One, two, buckle your shoe. Three, four. (heavy breathing) - I don't know how much time I have left but, whatever happens this is my last halfway house. - Has it been a good run? - Oh yeah. Ever since I got out I've been working halfway houses one way or another. Chaperone, counselors. I like to think the work has meaning. It does help those guys from going back in, I've seen that. - Is it always that bad? - Health? No, no. No I get these coughing fits every so often and then my strength, you know, it comes and goes. - Well how are you feeling now? - A little better. - Better is good. - I'll take it. You know what Clarence? You really are a force for the good around here. You could do this. Keep ex-cons stepping right. Help 'em to stay out here, not go back inside. Give 'em a chance. Eh that's all I do. Will you consider that for me? * You're the one who said goodbye * You're the one who said let's give it a try - [Roach] Help me. * You're the one who said we're through (gagging) * You're the one who said I'm the only one for you * But why am I here singing alone without you * And why is hole picking with no place to go (gasping and gagging) - Okay go. - Is anybody around? - No, no, no. - Okay. Let's go. (protestors shouting) - Come on buddy, let's light this candle. - Hold your horses. Did you not see that little girl go in there? What are you gonna do, burn up some innocent little girl? She didn't do anything. - No, that's why we gotta empty the house, come on. - Look at you, you're like one cold militant motherfucker now, aren't you? - Yeah buddy. (protestors shouting) - During evening they reached the end of the red crawfish. Let's stop here for a meal, said the fox, and rest for an hour or two. * I can't sing my song baby * I can't sing my song * No I can't sing my song without you - The sherman was named fire eater. He was a dreadful looking man. But on the whole he had not a bad heart. - Oh there they are, the honeymoon couple. - Thanks Cliff. Babe but I think it's time Theresa and Ayana got going. - Yeah it's getting kinda late. - Will I see you tomorrow. (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - Well I'll be damned. Now I understand why she had to stay here instead of the women's halfway house. But I must say I did wonder. - You must be Emilio's wife. - That's right. Theresa. - Hey Theresa, I'm Mark. I'm a friend of your husband. - Nice to meet you, Mark. - Come on baby, you should go. - Oh don't go. Not yet. - Come on. - Hold up, I need to talk to Cliff first. - Oh yeah, yeah, come on in my office, gotta get those papers. - She's cute. - Hey, what the fuck is up with you? - Is that a question? You gonna force me into sex until you get an answer you like? - Keep your fucking voice down. - Oh what you're not proud? - Listen I know things got rough, okay. - Rough. You raped me. - Oh don't fucking say that. Things got away from us okay? You understand? And you can't rape a guy. - Fuck. You love your wife Emilio? - Shut your fucking mouth. - You protect her? - I will kill to protect what I have with my wife. - You don't want to face her disappointment. - Listen to my fucking words, I will kill to protect what I have with my wife. - Then you're gonna have to think good and hard about what you'll tell her. - Nobody's gonna tell her nothing. - You will. You have to tell her why you can't fuck her after being behind bars for so long, because you can't fuck her after you fucked me. - What's this can't bullshit? What you think I'm gonna get fucking hung up on you? A chick with a dick? Shit I have fucked her, in fact I just fucked her upstairs. And I ain't gotta explain nothing to you about that shit. And you will keep your fucking mouth shut because this is my last fucking warning, I will kill you. Do you understand me? - You fucked her? After you had your dick up my ass? - That's right. Yeah. - Well then you just killed her. You just killed her and you killed yourself too. Only it's gonna go real slow and you're gonna have to explain why. That's right, four syllables, H I V, Aids. Oh yeah, you didn't think all that medicine I took was hormones, did ya? Well it's not. I have two different strains of hepatitis and a very nasty case of HIV. In case that goes unnoticed, my herpes sores show up three times a year, just say hello. - You don't have AIDS. - I do. And hepatitis. And while none of that has to be a death sentence anymore but, it takes some consideration to keep that away from the people you love which you didn't do. You fucked me in the ass and then you slid your nasty cock into your wife. You're gonna have to get that treated. And your darling little wife is gonna need treatment too. Or else the road ahead is not gonna be pretty for her. Have fun explaining that one, rapist. - These forms are filled out perfect. - Good because he should be getting his first paycheck from the landscaping services. - Oh okay. - When do you think he'll get back home to us? - Well I just got a couple standard things I gotta check on. The job, bring that check back in to show to me, and he's got you, he's on track. - Did you hear that? - Can you take these in the office and just sign wherever she signed. - [Emilio] Oh yeah, yeah sure, okay. Thanks okay. - Three places. Geez Marilyn, I can't help but notice the difference. - Call me Mark. - Mark? - I'm going back to my given name. - Okay Mark. What are you doing, what's going on here? - I'm not a docile woman anymore Cliff. I'm a man. - Okay then. - Alright you guys gotta get going, it's getting crazy out there. - Okay. Where's Ayana? Where's Ayana? - Ayana? - Where's Ayana? - Where's Frank? - Ayana? - Frank! - Ayana! - [Frank] 11, 12. - Easy, easy, easy. (all yelling) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No! Clarence no, Clarence no! (groaning) (crying) - [Cliff] Frank, Frank. (grunting) - Ayana, Ayana baby. (somber music) - Jesus Clarence, what the fuck? - Think I can get a cell to myself this time? (protestors shouting) - You cut off the phones, I need somebody to make a call. Call the ambulance, the police, one of my residents is dead. One of my residents is dead. - Is it the child molester? - Is it the pedophile? - What difference does it make who it is, just call the police. - A dead kiddie fucker, that's a good thing. A dead kiddie fucker. (all shouting) - Dead kiddie fucker, dead kiddie fucker, dead kiddie fucker, dead kiddie fucker, dead kiddie fucker. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay I get it, you're happy about it. Now can someone please call the cops please? (all shouting) - Yeah good luck with that pal. - You put your phones away? No, don't go. Hey you gotta help me, don't put your phones away. You bastards, don't put your phones away. - What about burning down this house? After all, I've fucking been patient. - Hey forget about it alright? We got what we came for. Let's get the fuck outta here. - [Cliff] You gotta call, please help me. I need your help. - Wait! - I need your help. We need your help, we need your help! - Wait. There's sinners in our neighborhood. - We need your help, we need your help! - Wait, don't go, it's not over. It's not done, they're still here. There are sinners in our midst. This house must be shut down. They'll put another pedophile in there. Another curse will descend on us. - [Radio Preacher] One who commits adultery with his friends wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. If there is a man who lies with his father's wife. - Don't you care? They are a scourge. - [Radio Preacher] The redemption of hell shall not warrant a lifetime of evil. - Well Miss Rosie, looks like we both lose. Happy? - [Radio Preacher] Take his hand and let him lead you to the lights heaven, far from the flames of hell. - Hey Cliff. He didn't do anything to her, nothing. (speaking in foreign language) - My daughter told me the truth. Ayana always tells me the truth. Right baby? (melancholy music) - Way to go Frank. Well consider yourself under house arrest until I can get the cops here for you. - Okay. - You impress me Mailman. - Why is that Mark? - It's what you really wanted. Isn't it? To control your own destiny. - And you? - Now I'm in control too. (somber music) (coughing) - I love you, I love you, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. (ominous music) (match scratching) - Burn in hell sinners. (sirens blaring) * Oh when the saints * Come marching in * When the saints come marching in * Oh lord I want to be in that number * When the saints come marching in * Oh when the sun refuse to shine * Oh when the sun refuse to shine * Oh how I want to be in that number * When the saints come marching in * Oh when the trumpet starts to call * Oh when the trumpet starts to call * Oh how I want to be in that number * Oh when the saints come marching in * Yeah (scat singing) * When the saints come marching in (scat singing) * When the saints come marching in
