Jean, my dear friend! Marquis, my friend. How are you? Jean, Jean! You are as handsome as ever. Oh, you are so right! I thank you very much to recognize... You are just in time for lunch. - Lunch? - Yes, won't you join us? Yes, lunch... I... Did you say us? - Oh, you have not heard, eh? - No! What? What? I have just married a luscious girl! You must meet her. You must meet her... Chantelle! Chantelle?! Oui, mon cher... my love? Yes. You must meet mon cher ami... Jean Navarro! Enchant?, monsieur! Chantelle... Chantelle, oh Madame! I have travelled the world over... I have never... never have I gazed... upon a creature so lovely as you. Merci, monsieur. Mes yeux. (**) Marquis, mon compliments! Thank you! Now, now, now, to lunch, eh! More food! Bring on more food! D?licieuse! Monsieur... - Monsieur Navarro? - Oui, oui! Would you like... Would you like to take a walk in the garden? Madame, that is a most lovely idea. That is our rose garden. Roses... lilies... Lovely! And that is our 500-year-old sycamore tree. Five hundred?! Oh... your eyes! Your eyes are like your trees. Yes. The stables. - And there's... the stables. Hmm... they are nice, yes. And here... Here is our pear tree. - Apple... tomato... A pear tree? Yes, yes of course! - No, pear, pear. - I recognise it. - And this... ...this is the summer house. Oh, I could tell that! Jean... Jean...! - Yes, what? - You are a handsome man. Oh, and the summer house. Yes, thank you, Madame! You have a lovely summer house! I think I am falling in love with you. Oh, yes... So soon after lunch?! I mean Madame, you are married. But my husband is a rat! - Well, besides. - He is vulgar... - I know! - And a big fat pig! - This cannot be! - Can it? - But, Jean...! - What? - Jean, I cannot help myself... How I love you truly. But this is not the time nor the place to speak of such a delicate matter, my love. Can't you meet me in my chambers tonight? - Oh yes. Ah yes! Well, there you are, Jean! Let me show you our garden! - Garden? - Yes... this is our rose garden... - Roses, I could tell, yes, yes.... Entrez! Enter, s'il vous plait! - Oh, Jean... - Chantelle! - Jean, are there two we are alone? (**) - Yes, we are alone! Madame, please, I do not enter into these things very lightly. - No? You are most desirable, I must say, Madame, but I... ...how can I tell your love is true? But my love... I am yours! Well, I mean... - But it is not sex alone that is of interest to me. - Oh no? Oh no, no... I must have proof... living proof of your love. Ah, here... Here is my proof. Well, Madame, you must remember that women come easily to me. It is true love that I need. I have been hurt so often by a simple romance... I am a complex machine... I am not a simple man as I appear I am. Mon pauvre cher! What must I do to please you? For I must have you! I... make for you a circumstance... You wil obtain for me three things to prove it, your love. Three things! Number one: I require it, the tail feathers from your husband's favorite hunting hawk... - Kali. - Tail feathers? - Yes. - Oh, no! - Oh, yes! Number two: a lock of hair from his beard. Impossible! And thirdly, a sound tooth from his jaw. - A sound tooth? - Yes. No, you ask too much! - I, too much? Oh, it can never be! I am sorry, my darling, for both of us... ...for both of our sakes. I am so sorry, bye now. But always remember, my dear... that I am considered to be the greatest lover in all of history. More food and drink for my friends, eh?! We are having a feast of all time! Food I say! Drinks, yes, drinks! Mon cheri, mon pet! My pet, how beautiful you are! Chantelle! Chantelle, what have you done to Kali?! It is because I love you! But why? Well, you spend so much time with Kali. We have no time alone. Oh, Marquis, you are so fortunate to have such a loving wife! Come here, my love, come here! What have you done? I'm sorry, but I got carried away in my passion. Well, give me another kiss. Wait, there's something I must tell you. - Who, me? -Yes, my love. You have a distasteful tooth. Well, I must have my surgeon remove it, no? No, no, my love. He will hurt you. I will do it! Everyone out, imm?diatement. Out! If you please.... Excuse me! Alright, ma ch?rie... Oh, Jean... I have all three... I have got them now! Now I am yours. -Yes, my love. And I am... Wait, your husband is coming. Not now! Not now... Later... Your husband... I've got it, Chantelle... We shall go on a picnic. - Oh, a picnic! - Picnic. Food! Under the beautiful pear tree. - A picnic... Magnifique! Magnifique! - Wonderful, oh yes. Ah... Jean! Not now! Now where is the dessert? Who brought the dessert? Oh, I must have forgotten it, Marquis. I will get some pears, from it, the pear tree. Wonderful! A lot of them, eh?! Oh, what a lovely friend, that Jean! No, no, Marquis! Stop that. Oh, that is terrible! Stop that, this instant! Stop what? Oh, Mr Marquis, I am so embarrassed... I thought you were my friend... How can you...? That is indecent. What are you talking about? You cannot have intimate relations right here in front of me in broad daylight. - You must be insane! - I am what? We aren't doing anything. Nothing! You are doing nothing? I can see with my own eyes, Monsieur. You are lying there with your wife. I tell you we are just sitting here, waiting for our pears. Then it must be this tree, Marquis. You have here... a magic pear tree!! - A magic pear tree?! - Yes! From up here, you two appear to be lying in each other's arms. I tell you. I will come down and you can come up and see for yourself. Alright. I will look for myself, but if you are wrong... I shall have your head, for saying such things in front of my wife. Would I lie to you, Monsieur? Oh, Chantelle, mon baby! - Jean! I think he's lost his mind! Poor devil... He's been on horseback too long. He is right! It's a magic pear tree! Winner of the Grand Prix at the International Animation Festival in Annecy.

You're beautiful. And you. Me? Yes, you are... -What? considerate. How did you know? I just knew. Because we are meant for each other. You're so feminine. And I'm so... Well, I guess I am, but... - I?m a bit on the fat side. - Where? Well, here, and here, and here. Kiss me. You kiss nice. You really kiss! I mean... and you do have a nice body... Oh my goodness! - Oh, do you really think so, honey? - Yes, I do. It's all there. It's here and there and there. Oh Harry, yes. Oh I love you! And I love you. When are we getting married? That sounds cute. Cute? That's all you can say? It isn't even a nice niceness? It's... Yes, it's nice. - Of course, there are other things. - What else is there? Sex. - Alright, that did it, Harry! - That did what? That did it. That is not right... I am sorry, that is not right. That is all you ever think about. You think of nothing but that. Harry, make a transition, turn over a new leaf. Think of friends. - I think of friends making love, kissing... - The man over there, Harry, just look... - Just look. Look at that nice man over there... - What man? - Right over there. - That's a man? He hasn't moved since we've been here. Except one time he moved when we mentioned sex. He moved... See! Sex. Sex, sex, sex. What are we doing? Why am I talking to him, and... Harry, be friendly. Go on, Harry, get him a drink. Hi there! That drink's on me! On me. - Good, good! - What's the matter? Forget it! Harry, I don't think you really gave it the good try... now... - What are you talking about? - I don't think your approach was right. Maybe he does not drink. Wait a minute. Here. Why don't you give him this? Will you please let it drop? You're out of your mind. Come on, Harry, just give it to him. Would you just give it to him, please?! Here, would you take a little love from this girl here? This is my sweetheart and she wants to know if you'll be her friend. She wants a friend, badly. You... you really did it, didn't you?! You see that? He doesn't have a face. Do you see he doesn't have a face? You had to open your mouth! Why? Harry, he can't see a thing. He can't smell. He can't drink. - He doesn't have a face, how can he? - Oh, he's so unhappy. Do something, please, it's just too sad. I can't stand it. He is in such a bad way, I would rather just forget about him. - Oh please Harry, do something for that poor sad lonely... What do you want me to do?! Do you want me to... Do you want me to give him my eye? Is that what you want me to do? I'll give him my eye! - So what? Simple, you know... - Harry, dear... Harry... Give him your eye. Where did you get an idea like that? Well... Harry, come on, come on honey, you're a genius. - Are you crazy, are you out of your mind? - Your right eye. Your right eye. - My... Why, my... Alright... if that's asking too much, maybe your left eye. The left eye, it's a much better one, I think. You know we really don't have much more of a choice... in that there's only the left or the right. Harry, you heard me! I said your eye, eye, eye! - Now, you better make? if you can't make up your mind? Now you did it. You really went ahead and did it, didn't you? Why did you do that? Why? Oh, honey, look... he's so happy! He is happy. - He's crying. - He is crying. He is crying out of my eye. That's how he's crying. Did that occur to you? Oh, Harry, he can see now, and he's laughing. Oh look, dear... Look, he's smelling the flower. - He can't smell a thing. - Why? Because he doesn't have a nose. Oh, no! No... no, I... I can't ask you to do that. Do what? - Give him your nose. - Give him my nose? What if I just happen to want to give him my nose? No, I'm sorry, Harry, you should not do that. It's a broken nose. - Where? - Right here, feel it. Oh, yes. My goodness! I'm not really losing anything. Oh, Harry, you are so marvellous! Lose a nose, gain a friend. That's what I always say. Oh, he likes that. Oh, he loves that... look, he can smell! Isn't that funny? Here, buddy! Here, fella! Have a drink! Oh, you have no mouth. Well, let's cap your face! - Wait a minute, Harry... - I'm gonna give him my mouth! - That is enough!! - I say that I'm gonna give, give! Hello hello hello hello... Hello! And I want to thank you very much. That was very nice of you to do, to give me... Oh, Harry! Harry, please... You shouldn't have done that, my friend, but I do truly love you for it. You know, may I refer to you as "young lady"? You have a most generous husband. Oh, he's not my husband. Well, then that means you're not married to him? - Oh, no. - You must love him dearly. Well, I'm in love with his, uh... His eyes and nose and mouth... All of which I have now. - Oh, yes. - Plus me. Him plus me makes us... Isn't that nice? Oh, yes! Oh... yes! Oh, shut up, Harry! He's trying to talk. And this is a nice friend that we have here. - Call me Dick. - I'm Kathy, but you can call me Kate. - Kate? Well, that's a wonderful thought. - Yes, I thought so. Kathy, Kate, I like that. Feels good on my mouth. On his mouth? No, it's my mouth now. Oh, Harry, will you shut up? How about a little walk under the bridge... You and I, we'll go by the bridge. Dick, I really don't know. I do think I should ask Harry. I think you should too. I think you should ask. It's only fair. - If he says no, distinctly, we won't go. - Alright. Harry... dear... What do you think of my possibly going with our good friend Dick? Oh, thanks, Harry... I knew you'd understand. Isn't he a nice friend? - He is a nice friend. - Oh, yes! Anyone that'll give you his nose and eyes and mouth and... Oh, mercy... Oh, that's cold... The water... Subtitle revision by FatPlank for KG
