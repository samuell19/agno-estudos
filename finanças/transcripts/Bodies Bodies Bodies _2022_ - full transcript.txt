I really need to... Hold it. Don't look! I love you. You don't have to say it back. I'm sorry. I just... I love you. They're not as nihilistic as they look on the internet. That's just, like, what they want you to think. So, David thinks you're a childhood friend. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, he actually was, um, my preschool boyfriend. Of course, before I realized that I was a raging dyke. Wow. They all look so impressive. You're impressive. Yeah, sure. I'm serious. Jordan is going to be obsessed with you. So... Who is that? My mom. You little freak. I'm... I'm not. I just... She's gonna be fine, all right? It's okay to be nervous. That's part of the fun. Ugh, this fucking window. It's gonna be so fun! You coming? Yeah. Um... I forgot something in the car. Okay... Don't take too long. Your game. Oh, my God! Surprise, bitches! Oh, my God! You fucking whore! What the fuck? It's Sophie. Bitch! Oh... What is she doing here? - I don't know. - Oh, oh... Hello! You got me soaking wet, you bad little girl. - Come here... - Whoo, boy! Hey, did I win? Yes, Greg. I told you guys. I got really big lungs! I know. Oh, my God. I can't believe you're here, like, last time I saw you, you were coked out on the subway, pissing on the floor like a little hyena. I thought you were an NYU student. Oh, my God. And that is why we do not let the Henny monster out anymore. No, no! Okay, but, seriously, how are you? I'm good. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, I'm, like, really good. Good. Good. You look so good. I miss you! I miss you too. Also, I have to say, love the podcast. Okay, we have a fan of the pod. We love the podcast. A fan of the pod. Oh, my God! It's so good to see you! I can't believe that you're here! It's, like, what? Hi. Hi, I'm Emma. Hi. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. That was so rude of me. I'm Alice. You guys, this is Bee. Bee, this is everyone. That's David, my best friend in the whole, whole, whole wide world. That's Emma. That's Jordan, and... 'Sup! I'm Greg. 'Sup, player! I'm Sophie. Oh! Whoa. You're Sophie? Real nice of you to make it, Soph. Ooh, spicy, spicy, Jordan. What is that supposed to mean? Just means that we have all been here and nobody had any fucking clue that you were coming. Let alone, an hour before the storm is supposed to start, so... What? I totally told you guys that I was coming. And I texted you. In the group chat? Yeah. No, you didn't. Whatever, you guys know that I'm useless with text, right? Also, we meant to come up yesterday, but then Bee got scheduled for a shift at work, so... Oh, where do you work? - Game Hut. - Oh, nice. Why are you guys being so weird? Are you talking about me? What are you doing with that champagne? - Guys! You know you're not supposed to touch my dad's shit. Sophie is here. Okay, it's Sophie. It's a once in a millennium sighting. - We're doing it. - No. Yes, come on. - Who wants to pop it? - I'll do it. Greg, you'll help me pop it? Yeah, I'll pop it. Okay. Yeah. I, um... I brought something. Oh! What, uh... What is it? It's, uh, zucchini. A bread. - It's zucchini bread. - Thank you. Yum. - Hey, nerds. - That's sweet. Oh, my, God! Oh, my God! How did you do that? Did you see that? All right. It's not that cool. That was crazy. Oh, my God! Wow. Wow. That was so sick. I can't believe we didn't video that. Give me my dad's Gurkha sword. Gimme that. Here, man. Fuck, that was so good. I just found it on the wall. Yeah, don't grab shit off my wall. Whoa! Eh, careful with that pour, the shits expensive. All right, all right. There we go. There we go. Thanks. Really impressive. Nice pouring. Soph, you want? I'm sober. Yay! No, thanks. Congrats. - Cheers. - Cheers. To hurricanes! To hurricane parties! - Yeah. - To hurricanes. To hurricanes. Deep. Guys it's starting! Party time! Starting. Shit. Fuck. Okay, what's going on with Max? Nothing. Where is he? He's just taking a break. He'll be back. What does that mean? Is that all you got, motherfucker! Let's go! Hey, fuck face! Can we talk for a second? Can you knock? No, it's my house. Sure. What's up? In private. Oh! Sure. I'm sorry. He'll learn. I'll be right back. Yeah, that's what Tom Hanks said in Castaway. She's actually really cute. In like a school shooter type of way. "Brought you zucchini bread, Dave." She's mine. Hands off. Hey. Oh, hi... I... Uh, I was just... No, no, I know. It's beautiful. The house. Sophie's parents have one that's even bigger. Just be careful, okay? With Sophie. Just... be careful. Okay. Okay. But he's, like, not hot. You know what I mean? He's like, like, your mom would be like, "Ooh, he's hot." Not your mom, I mean moms in general. Moms that have been married for like 10, 15 years and they see, like, him going out of a Starbucks... Alice got to bring someone without telling anyone. So you do read the chat. Why is everyone so obsessed with the chat? Now, you're here. I'm here, we're here together, right? Why are we worrying about the chat? When we can just live in the moment. Yeah, it's 'cause you went to rehab and you're not on drugs. So, like, everything is like, "Ooh, why don't we just all be cool, man?" You have a little problem with Greg? The lumberjack. It's a new pod. I'm not used to the inhaling yet. What is he, like, 40? I don't know. I think Alice found him on Tinder, or some shit. Apparently, he was in Afghanistan. I think he was in the Army, or some shit, so... Well, that's hot. He's not... He's not, like, that hot. You don't have to think he's attractive, only Alice has to think that he's attractive. Like, I feel, like, I'm more attractive than that. You do? Absolutely. And what are the features that you're bringing to the table? Well, I just look like I fuck. You know what I mean? Mmm. I look like I... I fuck. And that's the vibe I like to put out there. Yeah. No, uh, yeah, he's, he's really handsome. Whatever. I mean, we don't have to talk about it all the time. What the fuck happened to your face? Fucking Max. Max did that? Yes, fucking Max, really. Okay? I was standing outside and he just ran up to me and punched me in the eye. Just ran up to you? He just did. Look at it. He just came up to you and did that, huh? I think it... actually think it looks kind of dope, though. Don't you think? It's getting fucking darker. I look like a, like a warrior. Right? Like, it's kind of... It's kind of cool. Like, it's kind of hot. Like, if you saw me coming out of a 7-Eleven, you'd be like... Um... So have you had a chance to, uh, talk to my parents at all? What the fuck are you doing here, Soph? I missed you. We both know that's a lie. Nobody's ever missed me. Ugh, no! Please, no! Ugh, my God, can you turn that off? It's bumming me out. Yeah. You're right. You're right. Hey, guys, can I... Can I get on the Wi-Fi? Oh, God, I can never remember the password. It's, like, an actually good password. I'll transfer it. What's your email? Uh... What? What is your email? Hey... I'm sorry. My service went out, but I am on a Wi-Fi now. So, that's good. I 100% wanna do a TikTok. All of you can do it. Okay. Do you know this? Which one is it? I don't know what I'm doing. Follow... We'll watch it... You'll catch it. Yeah. Okay, ready, three, two... Keep up, keep up. - Go! - Look at you. Are we at the last part? That was good. That was good. Okay. Greg went a little rogue but we're checking the moves. No, you didn't. Again, again, again. At the end you go like this. Ready? Get ready. You okay? We should just, just post it. It's very good. I'm ready for the flow. One more time! Three, two, one, go! Do you want a drink? Do you want something? Here you go. There we go! She's having a good time. Let's go! Yeah! Oh, my God. Okay, bitch. I make it very salty. It's incredibly salty. Is this your first relationship? Uh, no. You just, kind of, give that vibe. - Not in a bad way. - Yeah. How long have you guys been together? Oh, uh, six weeks. Nice. Wow. Six weeks with Sophie. Alice. In a good way, that's good. Are you from Moscow? No. Oh. Why? Doctor Zhivago is my favorite film. Ugh, my God, what is going on with this storm? I'm, like, make up your mind. I want it to start, like, pouring again so that we can go fucking crazy. Oh, you know that has weed in it, right? Not a lot, I just wanted to let you know. Just didn't want you to go to town and then... - Yeah. - You know what I mean? Ooh, we're getting a lot of likes. Ow! Ow! What the fuck? David! Ow! What the fuck? Oh, my God! Are you being an incel? I'm coked up and I bit her. Excuse me. So did you, um... Did you go to college here in the States, or, um... Yeah, here... I, I mean, in Utah State. You need to chill out. I guess. No, I'm serious, you need to... You need to chill out. I'm just really sweaty and I need to hydrate myself. Okay? You should watch your girl. Looks like she's having fun with Jordan. Silence! What? Stop! Who wants to play Bodies Bodies Bodies? - Ah, fuck! - Yes! So, if you draw the piece of paper that has the "X" on it, you are the murderer. And you have to keep it a secret. Guys, I get so stressed out every time we play this. Someone always ends up crying. You always end up crying. Okay, I can access my emotions easily. Very incredibly easily. She's an actress, she always cries first. I'm just saying, this game gets very ugly. Oh, my God, no, it does not. It gets ugly when she ugly cries. Literally, every single time we play, people start fighting. Yeah, well, that's what makes it fun, Emma. Where's Max? He's not responding to my texts. Oh, Jesus... So, how do you play? So, I'm gonna hit the lights in a second. And if you are the murderer, you have to sneak around and kill someone by, like, touching them on the back. And then, everyone else has to avoid being killed. And then, if you are killed, you have to fall down and pretend you're dead. Like this. Cool. Hey, uh... Alice, do you wanna... - What? - Do you wanna... You know. Oh! Excuse me, I have to go. It's an emergency. Excuse me. The most important part is if you do come across a body, you have to yell, "Bodies, bodies, bodies." And then, once that happens, we'll turn all the lights back on and then we'll try to figure out who did it. Could you hold this? Did Greg touch that? Oh, my God. You're being such a dick about Greg. Just hold this. David... What? I, ugh... Okay... Look, what the fuck's going on? Come to the floor. Come to the floor. Get your ass over here, boy. Okay. All right. Who will do the honors? Oh... Get into it. Let's go. Ow! Ahhh! Bitch. Are you mad at me? - No. - Okay. - Ow! - Jordan! Whoa. What? It's the game. Wowza... Oh, my God... Oh, come on! What was that? Bee! You have to hit more. You got to put some muscle into it. You gotta... Yeah, go for it. Yeah. Come on! Slap him around, he deserves it. Fucking hit me! - He wants it. - No, he deserves it. He really deserves it. Do it. If anyone deserves to be hit, it should be him. - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, for fuck sake like this. Oh, my God! David! David. See? David. You're a fucking dick! What? You are such an asshole. I'm teaching her how to play the game. Baby, stop, stop! Wait, guys, someone has to hit me. Who's gonna hit me? I'll do it. Ow! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Okay! - Are we ready to go? - Yes, let's fucking go. - Yes. - Let's play the game. Holy shit! I'm so fucked up. Ahh. You ready? Yes. Hey. Oh! I see white man... Bodies, bodies, bodies! You guys! Over here. No! All right, who tried to take advantage of my body in the dark? Your wish, babe. Oh, why, God? Why? He was so hot! Was it you? No. Okay. So, do we have any nominations? Emma Whoa. Wow, coming in hot. What? Why? Yup, I think it was Emma. Why do you think it was me? Yeah, David, why? Okay, well, she just, like, agrees with everything that everybody is saying. And that's her strategy in this game and it works every single time. So, I'm just calling it now. It's Emma. Do we have any other nominations? Um... Yeah, David. Oh, come on. It's low hanging fruit. I mean, he who casts the first stone. Guys, why isn't he moving? Greg? Baby, get up. You don't have to keep pretending for this long. Baby? Come on, Greg. Greg... Greg... Get up. Wait. Greg? Greg! Greg, get up! Greg! He's not getting up. Hey, relax, this always works. I know. Oh, hey! Oh, my God. You really scared me with that. You're a little trickster, Greg. I know, Jesus Christ. Cute. Okay, so... what about David? Wait, maybe it's Jordan. She's always really aggressive when she's the killer. There you go. What? No, I am not. You're lying. Your voice always goes really high when you lie. No, it doesn't. I... It... I've... It's definitely David. Why are you yelling? That would be so fucking obvious if I were the killer, which I'm not. I think you're digging yourself into a little hole here, Dave. Guys, Jesus Christ... The best defense is a good offense. Hey, you shut up. You're not supposed to talk. You're dead. The dead are actually not supposed to speak. Oh, yeah, you... Sorry, baby, you can't. It's a rule. Oh, my B. Yeah, no talking. Pack it up. What the fuck does that even mean, Greg? What's up? "The best defense is a good offense." What does that... What does that mean? Oh, you know, the best defense is a good offense. What... What does it mean, though? Uh, well... It, um... It means that the best defense is a good offense. Right, right, I heard you. But, what does it mean to you, Greg? Like... I don't know, could you elaborate on it for us? Break it down. Yeah, sure. So, hey, look in sports, there's... Oh, my God. You are such a fucking dick. Hey, this is a teaching moment. Oh, I see. You're fucking with me. No. No, I'm not fucking with you, Greg. I'm just having fun. We're all just having a good time. Right, guys? Right, Greg? We're just having fun. You know, I think it's time for me to put myself to bed. - Oh, come on, Greg. - Greg, no. Good night, Greg. You kids have fun. Catch you later, player. By the way, can I just point all of our attention to the fact that Emma hasn't said a fucking word. Whoa, you're right. Whoa, she hasn't! I'm just pointing out the obvious. That's all. Look, she's doing that swallowing thing. She always does that when she's fucking nervous! Oh, my God! Look, look! Oh, my God, you're doing it. You're swallowing it. - I'm not. - You are. Okay, I love you, but when you swallow, it's just fucking... Like, why? Swallowing is normal. - It's a normal thing to do. - Yeah... It's very un-attractive. I don't know why you do it? Oh, my God. Is that why you guys never have sex? What? Alice. What? It's not a bad thing. Some people have sex a lot. Some people have it less. Alice, what are you talking about? We do. I have it a lot. Some... - Are you fucking... - Oh, my God. Are you fucking talking about us behind my back? No. Yes. No. Yes. No, I'm not. I'm not! I'm not. - I just... - That's just great. No, I... We... I... You never really... I... I don't... You're always gas lighting me. "Gaslight," shut up. It's a fucking dumb word. Excuse me? Gaslight is, like, one of the most over used words ever, to, like, the point of annihilation. Okay, it doesn't mean anything other than the fact that, like, you read the internet. Or, like, "Congrats, you have a Twitter account." Ugh, that is so fucking lame. "Gaslight," get over it. Like what's next? You're gonna call me a narcissist? Or a foot soldier of, like, the white supremacy? Like, come on, fucking, be more original. Lame. What? I'm just saying, that, this is what I'm saying, she doesn't have a thought in her fucking head that hasn't been said by anybody else. Nothing that isn't preordained. David, that's really mean. Look, she's crying. What? Why is everybody looking at me like that? This is not her real cry. I vote David. Yeah, me too. Are you fucking serious? Guys, it's Emma. She's an actress. She's acting. Third. Wow, how fucking surprising. Yeah, look at your quivering upper lip. Like, we all didn't see you in Hedda Gabler. Fuck you. Yeah, yeah, yup... Fourth. Oh, my God. Fuck this game! Holy shit. Relationships can be really complicated. Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure? I'm fine. I'm 100% fine. Are you sure, baby? Yes. Let's play. Ow! Wow, good one. All of a sudden she loves the game. That was crazy. Give it to me. Damn! Ah! Oh, my God! What was that? - What the fuck? - Is that the lights? What was that? - Oh, my God. - Was that from the storm? Oh, my God. I bet you that it was David. David! JORDAN: It's not David. Come on. I'm texting him. David, are you fucking with us? Turn the lights back on. Hey, does anybody have service? No! Ugh, wait, mine's not working. Okay, I think the WiFi is also down. Oh, my God, I'm gonna fucking kill him. Great! David! David! This is real fucking cute! Soph, can he disable the generator from garage, or the basement, or whatever? I don't know. David! Okay, well, I'm gonna go and flip the breaker. Is it in the garage or is it in the basement? - David! - Soph? - Huh, what? - Okay, whatever. Okay, I'm gonna go get some more flashlights. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Where is a bathroom? Um, uh, downstairs, first door on your right. Going there. David? David, are you fucking with us? I meant the other stairs. David! David! Help! Somebody help! No, no, no. What the fuck happened? Oh, my God! Why would... - Check his pulse. - What the fuck? Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! Hold his head up! Oh, my God! Fuck! - Fuck! - Is he dying? - Hold his head up! - Come on, baby, hold on. What the fuck happened to his neck? I love you, David. Shit. What is happening? Shit! What are you doing? I'm calling 911! Oh, my God! You have service? Fuck, no! Do you? - No! - Shit! Where are you going? Landline! We should move his body? Why? I don't know. Because he's... No, you can't move him. Did you watch SVU? It's evidence. - Of what? - Cause! Landline? No, there's no connection. Sophie, where are your keys? Your keys, Sophie, where are they? They're in the pocket. They're in her pocket... Where? Fucking help! Where are you going? - I'm going to the car. - To the car? Why? To get some fucking help. Wait, do you have a license? Doesn't she not have a license? I don't know. I don't think so. - Fuck! - He's dead! You have to go! I don't know! He stopped breathing! Branch! You have to push the gas. I know how to fucking drive, Alice! - I can't see. - Is the battery dead? - Oh, no... - What? I, I think I left the light on, on the mirror. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck are we supposed to do? Wait, where are your cars? We... We only have one car. Max picked us all up and he fucking left! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Max will probably be here any minute, right? Where's Jordan? She went to check the generator, I... What the fuck was he doing? - What are you talking about? - Fuck was he doing? Why the fuck was he outside in the storm? Hey! It's me, let me in! I found this. Outside in the mud. Don't touch it Um, does the security system work if the power goes out? Um... Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does. David's dad explained it to us. Nobody can get in without the code. Well, Max has the code. So... Max wouldn't... I'm just saying, like, where the fuck is he? Couldn't he have come back after last night? Alice, stop. What happened last night? - Nothing. - No. We did shrooms and Max told everybody that he was in love with Emma. Which David thought was beautiful in the moment, but maybe not today. Alice, that literally doesn't fucking matter at all. Where is Greg? Where is he? - What? - Where is Greg? I... He said he was going to bed. So my guess would be that he's sleeping. Okay, don't you think it's a little bit strange that he hasn't, like, woken up yet? Jordan, what are you trying to say. Maybe we should just go check on him. No, no, no. Jordan... What are you doing? Jordan... Jordan. What are you doing! - I'm staying safe. - Really? Because it looks like you're grabbing a fucking meat cleaver to go look for my boyfriend! Wow. Boyfriend? That's the first time I've heard you call him that. That's crazy. Don't be such a bitch. Alice, I'm literally just protecting myself, okay? Let me remind you, our friend is dead. So, if you could just, like, not escalate the situation... I'm not escalating. You're holding the knife and you're moving your hands while you talk. Alice, how long have you known Greg? Like... long. Alice. Ugh... I don't know exactly how long. I... like... two weeks. Okay, uh... What do you know about Greg, Alice? Oh, my God. What do you know about him? Oh, my God, guys! Oh, my God! Relax. Stop! Stop! Stop! I know that he's a good person, okay? He's fundamentally a good person. He wouldn't do this. Like, no. Do you know his middle name? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how much fucking money he makes? Do you know his last name, Alice? I know a lot. Our first date was at... was at a bar. He drank, like, a medium amount... Okay, Alice... Stop. He likes nature. What is his middle name? - He's a Libra moon. - Where does he live? You don't ask what your middle name is! - Okay? For a really long time. - Oh... Fuck! He's a Libra moon. That says a lot! Fuck! Greg! Shh! What? You just said we're looking for Greg! Okay, well don't fucking, Alice... Greg! Can you come into the kitchen? We need you for a second. Shut up. Stop waving the knife at me! Fuck. You're making me... Stop. Stop. Greg! Stop. Just stop. Just be quiet. Stop. Stop. Greg! Don't. Relax. Don't grab my mouth. Relax. Relax. Relax. You're silencing me. Oh, my God. Get the fuck off. Okay, stop. Don't grab me like that again. And she came at me with a knife. - I'm sorry... - Back off. Okay, buck! Wait, where's Emma? Oh, my God. Emma? Emma? Guys, maybe Emma could have done it. She was really pissed at David. Alice, what the fuck? Emma wouldn't do that. She was devastated. She's having, like, a full-on panic attack. Yeah, but she's an actress. She's acting. Remember Hedda Gabler? Okay, not to be mean, but she wasn't that good in Hedda Gabler. This is my room. So open it. You open it. What happened to, "Greg would never do this?" He wouldn't. Okay, so open it. I will in one second. I'm going to. He's not here. Soph, are there any guns in the house? Guns? No. No way. David's dad can be a dick, but his politics check out. Guys... What the fuck is this? Uh... But... He wanted to be prepared for the hurricane. He... Why did he circle the fucking house on his fucking map? We have to find Emma before he does. Okay. Let's check my room next. I don't think he's hiding in my bra. Guys... Come here. Oh, my God, Emma. Emma. Are you okay? What's going on? What are you guys doing? You scared me What's happening? It's so hot in here. What is that? Xanax. Do you want one? Yeah, give me one. - You want one? - No. Hey, you take this. - Why? - I'm gonna find Greg. Greg, why? Where's Max? Maybe Max did it. Maybe he is here. Max was really angry at David. I'm serious, he looked like he was gonna do something really fucked up. Alice! Shut up. I'm just saying. Max would never. Let's go find Greg. Okay. What the... - What the fuck? - Oh, my God. What the hell is on his face? It's his light therapy mask. He has seasonal depression. Let's go. Hey... Shh... Greg. - What's up? - Where have you been? Huh? Where have you been? Oh, I, uh... I couldn't sleep, so I came down here to do my exercises. Why didn't you answer me? Were you calling for me? Yeah. I... I had my headphones in. Are you guys still playing Werewolf? Greg! Stop! Stop it! All right. What am I supposed to do, huh? Why don't you tell us, fucking Greg? Is that my go bag? Is that a knife? Why did you bring a go bag? The hurricane? See, I told you. Why did you circle the fucking house on your fucking map? What's going on? David is dead. His body is outside. David's body. Wait, what? Why did you kill David? You murdered my boyfriend. No, no. David killed me. Right? This isn't a joke, Greg. David is dead. Somebody slit his throat. - What? - With a fucking sword, you fucking sick fuck! Oh... You guys are fucking with me? Oh, you guys are fucking with me. Fuck! Cute. No! Okay. Everyone needs to take a deep breath. Alice. Give me my knife back! What the fuck is going on? I don't know! - Put down the weapons. - You put it down. Now! On the floor! Okay, okay. How about this? - Put it down. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, we'll put them down. We'll put... We'll all put them down. Right? We'll put them down if you put yours down. We'll put them down. Okay. Okay. Yeah, please, please. - That seems fair. - Yeah. Okay. Putting it down. We're good. Yeah. Okay, this is good. All right. Jordan! Are you okay? - Ow! - Stop! Stop! - Please stop! - Alice? Stop. Stop! No! No! Sophie! No. No, no, no, Sophie! Mother fucker. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This isn't right. He didn't do it. Alice, how do you know? How do you that know he did? Look, I mean, like... If you look at all of us, like, on paper, logically, he is the most likely to commit an act of violence. On paper? What the fuck are you even talking about? I mean, he's the only one who served in the military, right? So... What? He's a vet. Right? Like Iraq? Or... No, I thought it was Afghanistan. He was a veterinarian. He was a veterinarian's assistant. Are you fucking serious right now? Then why did you call him G.I. Joe? Because... Have you seen him? Well, regardless, either way, like, out of all of us, he is the biggest unknown. We've known each other forever. Jordan, what are you trying to do? I'm not... I'm not trying to do anything. He's dead, okay? He's dead. We killed him. She killed him. Go change your shirt. We need to leave. We need to get out of here. We don't have a car. Okay, I'm going to walk. Emma, stop. What do you mean? You can't just fucking... Emma, you're literally in the middle of nowhere. Where are you going? I mean, it could have been any of us. We all scattered when the lights went out. I mean, it could have been Max, okay? Alice, you don't know what you are talking about. He punched David in the face because of you. Just because Max is in love with me doesn't mean he would kill David. Oh, what the fuck is wrong with you? What? This is not about you and Max. Why are you being so mean? Because I'm upset, Emma. I'm upset because somebody killed my best friend. Sophie, did you use? I can believe you're making this about you. I'm sad, too, okay? I'm scared, too. I loved him so much. It didn't seem like it. - What? - It seemed like you loved having a boyfriend. And you loved feeling comfortable. But, no, you did not love him. You didn't even fucking like him. You were just too scared to do anything about it. So you stayed for three years longer than you should have because you're a coward. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Right? I... You're... You're so toxic. Emma, calm down. You are. No! No, I'm not gonna... You are so toxic. And, honestly, when you fell off the face of the earth, David was relieved. He was relieved he didn't have to deal with you anymore. I wish they had chopped off your head instead, you spineless piece of shit. Sophie. Jesus fucking Christ. Emma. Emma, come on. Wait. - Wait. - Emma. Emma. Emma. That was real nice, Soph. Guys... Where the fuck is Bee? Emma. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm so fucked up right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? It was just, like, things started coming... Isn't that what you wanted? Yeah, Emma, that's what I wanted. That's what I was in the mood for. Thank you very much. What the fuck? Jesus Christ! You always think everyone is in love with you. It's so crazy. I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you want this? Yeah. Thank you. Sure. Bee? Soph? Emma? Help! Jordan! Help! - Help. - Where are you? Help! Please, help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Emma. - Oh, my God. - Emma. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? I don't know! I don't know. Don't touch her! I'm just trying to... Don't. No! ...figure out what happened. How am I supposed to know if I don't touch her? Don't, just don't, just don't. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I heard something. Um, maybe she... Oh, my God. - She fell, maybe she tripped? - No. No, no. She... She... She got pushed, okay? She was pushed. I told you it wasn't Greg! Are you happy that she's dead? No, but I told you it wasn't Greg! I did... I did tell you. Don't you see what's happening? What? Who was the killer? What? Who was the killer? In the game? It's following the same pattern. The deaths. Please... Please, just stop talking, please! David, Greg, Emma. David, Greg, Emma. No. Yes! - Fucking yes, Jordan! - No. No, it's not following the same pattern. Greg died and then we executed David. But in real life, David died and then we... Okay, but Greg, David, Emma. Greg, David, Emma. I mean, why else would somebody leave her there unless they wanted us to find her? Why would they want us to find her? Because they're playing a sick fucking game. Okay? Who was the killer? I wasn't the killer. Alice, you're fucking coked out. You're coked out, okay? We're all coked out. I'm not. I'm not. Are you wearing make up? I... I was upstairs, changing my... You look weird. Whose sweater is this? I found it upstairs. How long have you known her? Stop, Alice. Who are you? What? You show up here, start smiling at my boyfriend. What are you talking about? Your voice is trembling. No. No. Yeah. It is. I googled you. And there was nobody with your name who graduated from Utah State this year. There's literally no record of your attendance, at all. What the fuck? Listen, I can explain. Oh, my God. You discovered David's body. No, I just... You could have tampered with the generator, just like you tampered with Sophie's car. You said you left the lights on, right? Are you serious? We watched you kill someone. You literally murdered Greg! Literally! Literally! You sick fuck! No, are you crazy? No. Calm down. Let's just talk about it. Talk about it? Yeah. No... No. Let's just talk about it, okay? Mmm-mmm. I don't want to. - Sophie... Sophie. - No! Sophie. ALI, CE: Do not touch her! Whoa! You know what? I don't... I don't want you in here. Okay, calm down. No, seriously. Alice! Alice! I don't want you in here. I... Relax. Just shut up! Shut up! I don't want you in here. Get out of this room! Let go of me, Alice. Get the fuck out of this room! I don't want to look at your face anymore. Get out. - Alice, calm down. - I'm not... - I'm not calming down. - Let go of me, Alice. No, you killed my fucking boyfriend. You know what? You know what? It was self-defense. I... I want her out. Jordan, can you help me? All right. Jordan! Jesus, Alice. Get the fucking door! Jesus fucking Christ! I do not want her in here! - Relax! - No! - Relax! - No! Sophie! Sophie, do something! You killed him, get out! - Sophie! - Get out! Sophie! Stay here. I'm so hungry. How can you be hungry right now? I wasn't planning on this. Alice... What the fuck? How the fuck you get in here? She has a gun. Jordan has a gun in her pocket, Sophie, get away from her. No, no, Sophie, she's confusing... Let go of me. Are you kidding me? I don't have a gun. Then empty your pockets. Slowly! That's it? That's it. Oh, my God. You are the killer. In the... In the game... I... How the fuck did you get in here? Where is the gun? I don't have a fucking gun. We locked all the doors. How did you get in? You killed him. Why would I kill David? Why would I kill David? Why would I kill Emma? They are, literally, my oldest friends. You just fucking met them! How dare you? When I found David, you were the last person to get there. It took you awhile. That's true. Where were you when Emma died, hmm? You pushed her! Shut up! Guy's, don't listen to her. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about! And then, I saw you. I saw you getting the gun. That's a lie. That's a fucking lie. You're lying. You're a liar! You're lying through your fucking teeth. You lied about everything. You lied about everything to Sophie. You're a fucking liar. Yeah, you... You did lie to Sophie. Okay. Okay. I did go to Utah State for one semester. But my mom was... She was having a hard time and I came home to take care of her. And I did work at Game Hut, but they shut down our location, like, a week after I met you. I... I've been applying, but... What were you doing when I dropped you off at the mall? Hung out at the food court. I... didn't want to disappoint you. I was embarrassed. I should have told you. I just... My mom, she... She has... My mom has borderline. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, that's... That's really serious. Mental health is a really serious issue. I mean, I've never actually said this to anyone, but... but I have body dysmorphia. Oh, my God. Shut the fuck up, Alice. I wanted to tell you. I just... I just really wanted you to like me. You've got to be fucking kidding me. Oh, my God. Jordan, what the fuck? Are you telling me that you believe that pile of bullshit? Is that supposed to inspire confidence? Her mom has "borderline." Is that not a red fucking flag to anybody else? That's a serious issue. Where the fuck did you get that? David's Dad's rich! Rich people have fucking guns, Sophie! My parents are rich. They don't have guns. Well, I mean, we're all rich, but you and David are like rich, rich. That has never mattered to me... Oh, shut the fuck up! We didn't even want to invite you. We debated about inviting you, but because it's David's house. I didn't say that, but... And, no, you did not respond in the group chat. And then, you show up with this fucking psychopath. Don't call her a psychopath, that's so ableist. Fuck you. You deserve each other. I hope she fucking suffocates you in your sleep. Yeah, you didn't reply in the chat. And David actually told me that you, like, begged him to talk to your parents and, like, unlock your trust again. And that's why you're actually here. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, did he tell you that while you guys were railing lines in front of me. Your addict friend who you're supposedly so worried about? - We are worried. - No! No, no, no. Let me get this straight. Okay, let me get this straight. So, when the black girl has a coke habit, it's a problem. But when everyone else around her does it, including her best friend, who happens to be white and male, it's fine? I understand and I'm an ally, and I totally get how it... looks that way. And... Um... Jordan? Oh, my God. You are obsessed with playing the victim. Excuse me? I had to ride in the ambulance with you three times, thinking you were dead. I needed help and I got it and I'm sorry. You got help? You mean we had to narc on you to your fucking dad so he'd cut you off and ship you off to rehab, while you were quite literally kicking and screaming. Yeah. And then you just fell off the face of the earth. 'Cause that's what you do, Soph. That's what you do when things get tough, you run. You ran away to go write your fucking memoirs. It's creative non-fiction which is a valid response to life in an attention economy. Oh, fuck off and die. You write little essays about your mommy and her vodka. And your pussy and your feelings. And your fucking feelings. Oh, my God, we are all drowning in your fucking feelings. Feelings are facts. No! No, they're not. Facts are facts. Why did you ghost us, Sophie? Like why? Because you fucking trigger me. You enable me. Does she know? Does she know what? That you begged me to stop at your apartment on my way up here. And I did. And we fucked in your car. She's fucking lying. She's lying through her fucking teeth. She's trying to get in your head. Don't listen to her, okay? Check her texts. You are unhinged, Jordan. You are devoid of empathy. You have no feelings. Do you want to know why I could never ever be with you? Because you schedule everything in your fucking Google calendar, including sex. Because you have no soul. Fuck you. You're emotionally abusive. I had to go to therapy for PTSD. You can fucking ask Alice. Yeah, she did. For a long time. You hate Alice. No, I don't. Yeah, you despise her. You complain constantly about how vapid and annoying she is. You hate her. It's pitiful how you won't stop making fun of her stupid little podcast. Let her have the podcast. I don't know what you're talking about. You hate listen to her podcast. Wait... What? And you made us swear on our lives not to tell anyone. Jordan, is that true? I like your podcast, Alice. What is your podcast about? Hanging out with your smartest and funniest friend. Did you just groan? No. When I said "Hanging out "with your smartest and funniest friend." Oh, my God. Like that. Like that! Fuck! You just did it again. No, I didn't! First of all, a podcast takes a lot of work, okay? You have to organize the guests. You have to do a Google calendar and you build a following. It takes a long fucking time! And I've been working on it for a while! Okay? And then, let me say, that nobody likes you, okay? Nobody likes you! Nobody likes you! Do you know when you're drunk and you cry to me, "Oh, I'm afraid nobody likes me "because I'm mean and a bitch and I suck." Well, you do, okay? You fucking suck. And I only hang out with you out of pity and the suffocating weight of our shared history. And that is all. And you're just so in love with your rags to riches narrative, like you're the only fucking person in the world who didn't come from money. You know what? Your parents are upper middle class. No, they're not. Jordan. They are. They teach at a university. It's public. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I mean, no wonder Sophie OD'd. Who could date a fucking spreadsheet with a superiority complex? It's, like, you're such a... Ow! What the fuck? What the fuck, Jordan? Oh, my God. Are you serious? Did you just fucking shoot me? - No. - You fucking shot me. With a gun! No, I didn't shoot you. I... You fucking murdered them, you freak! You're the murderer. I knew it! I knew it, you're such a bitch! You're such a fucking bitch! - I didn't murder anybody. - Yes, you did. Jordan, put the gun down. I've never been shot before. It really fucking hurts! Put the fucking gun down, please. You did this. You made me do this. Why did you make me do that? What are you doing? Put the gun down. Why? Why did you shoot me? I did not shoot you. Yes, you did! With that gun! Stop, stop, stop. Alice, stop. Stop! With that gun. Stop waving it around. I'm not waving. Don't hit me. You already shot me. Stop! Don't touch me. - No, no, no! - Get the gun! - No! - Sophie, the gun! Don't! Stop! You're on my leg! You're on my leg! I want it. Give it to me! - No! - Let go! No! Ow! No! - No! - Give it to me. Give me it! Give me it! Get off of me! No! Get the fuck off me! Get off! Ow! My fucking leg! Where is it? Ow! I didn't do it. Please, don't move. Don't you fucking move. It's okay... It's okay, Jordan. Please, don't do it. Please, just... Stop! I didn't do it. Please, just stop, okay? Just put it down. Please, stop moving. Please... please, don't follow me, please. Please... Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop, stop, stop! Why are we doing this? Don't come up here. Don't, please, don't. Please put it down. Please stop. Please stay there. Oh, my God. Please... - Stop. - I'm begging you... Don't fucking come up here. Please. Sophie, I'm serious, just stay there. Stop. Just stay there. Just please stay there. I'm begging you. Please, fucking... Fucking stay there! Fuck! Bee! Check her texts. Sophie. Did you kill Emma? No. Did you? No. It's okay, if you did it. It's okay. I just want to know. You can tell me. Did you kill David? What? No. You killed Greg. To protect you. I had to. Will you answer this honestly? Okay, I promise. What is it? Did you... With Jordan? No. No. No, I didn't... I didn't. I would never. I love you, okay? Do you love me? I just wanted to touch you. You frighten me. Bee! Bee! We have to stay together! Bee! Bee! Bee? Bee? Where are you? I love you. We have to stay together. Bee! - Okay. - Bee! Hey, hey. I've been looking for you everywhere. I have to tell you something. I went to Alice's room and I... And then I found coke and then... I... I said all these things to Emma and she... I... I gave her pills 'cause... And then she tripped and fell. It's my fault. Sophie, it's okay. It's okay. I thought no one would believe me. Give me your phone. What? I want to see your text with Jordan. No. I have to see your texts. Please? No. Sophie. Stop! That's not my phone. Oh... What? That's not my phone. What happened? I have reception.
