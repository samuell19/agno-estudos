Sorry, could you please一 A questionnaire ... Could you please fill out一 Could you please fill out a questionnaire for me? Sorry, could you please一 Ah, a punch from the right side! These little nights in the middle of nowhere The cat is curled up into a ball on the usual couch Air conditioner blowing cool breezes The refrigerator buzzing My girlfriend watching drama The future that I pictured that day is here now Little Nights Little Love Minako, do you like fighting sports? What did you just say? I'm sorry, I'm just asking if you like fighting sports? Fighting sports. Is that the kind of fighting skills I know? You know, like a boxing game or something. It's too violent. I don't like to see people get knocked down. It makes sense. By the way, do you have a boyfriend? What? Ah, nothing. I don't have a boyfriend. You actually heard me. So, you don't want to have a boyfriend now? Not really, I just haven't found the right one. The right one? All I do every day is go to work and come back home. What about my little brother? Eh? Why don't you make a phone call and have a small talk with him? You have a little brother? There are only two kids in our family, a little brother, and an older sister. I'd say he's a bit of a dork, but he's a nice guy. And he won't get violent. That's the basic condition. A while back we were walking down the road and harassed by a drunk all he did was apologize. That's a bit irresponsible. But even so, he's an honest guy. Coming. Ah, it's Sato. Ah, hi Mio. What are you doing here? Can I play with you? Welcome, come on in. Did you say hi? She did. Excuse me. Come on in. You two are so close. It's the only time when a father and a daughter can be so close. Sato, you're here, have a seat. Have a seat, Sato. (An afternoon with a newlywed wife) Ah, I forgot to put it away. This man never tidies up the house. Did you watch it with him? How is that possible? I even can't guess when would he watch it. Correct! Correct! How are you going to raise kids like this? Don't worry, I've hidden all the kinky stuff. Then put the rest of them away, too. Correct! Well, he's so unpredictable. Thanks. When? October. That's a long way off. Yeah. Somebody's getting married. Eh? You're getting married, Sato? He can't be. It's our classmate from college, Kubota. Ah, it's him. He asked me to do an after party. Ah, I will help you host the bingo game. We don't know if there'll be any bingo game yet. Huh? Sato, do you have a girlfriend now? No, he's a loner. He's been a loner ever since. I haven't found the right one. I see. You haven't found the right one. What are you talking about? You want to absolve yourself of responsibility? What are you mad about? I hate it when people say, “I haven't found the right one.” But there really isn't one. All I do every day is go to work and come back home. Then I'm asking you, how do you meet the right one? If we are destined, I will definitely meet her. So, has good looks, a good personality, a similar age and has no boyfriend. A girl like that will automatically show up in front of you. That's exactly what you think, right? There's no such thing as a bargain in this world. Why do you have to talk like that? Maybe he really does meet a girl that way. Listen up, even those dating sites that say “Meet anyone you want” It's hard to actually meet the right one. You seem to be getting off-topic. Okay, so tell me, what's your ideal encounter? Well, I'm hoping for something a little more dramatic. As expected, you hoping for a dramatic encounter. There's no such thing. So, why not? You know the kind of girl who passes you on the street and then she drops her handkerchief. You just happen to walk by, pick it up, and hold it in your hand. “Sorry, you dropped something.” “Thank you.” “Let me buy you a drink to thank you.” It's a complete and utter cliche. That's nice. That's nice, isn't it? There's no such a nice thing like that! How is that possible? Pour more beer for me, please. Morning, Sato. You dropped something? Mr. Fujima, good morning. Something's wrong with my shoes. What? Nothing. Hello? Hello. I'm Itabashi Kasumi's brother. Well ... Thanks to your sister for taking care of me. Well, may I ask, what is it? “What is it?” My sister said you want to talk to me. She asked me to call you. She said you'd give me an important task. I'm fine, nothing in particular. What? I'm fine here. Oh, is that so? I think Kasumi might have misunderstood. I see. I'm sorry. My sister doesn't get it right sometimes. Sorry for causing you any trouble. That's okay. I'm sorry, too. Hello? What's wrong? Minako? Hello? Hello. It shows up again. “It shows up again?” You know, the black ones, the ones that crawl and move around. Ah, cockroaches. You have cockroaches in your house? Cockroaches, right? Don't keep saying those words, stupid. So, have you been in touch with Manabu since then? That kid won't tell me anything. If things were going well, he should have told me. I don't think things were going well, though. Any plans to get married? He only calls once or twice a week. We just have a small talk. So, no mention of a meeting up somewhere? No mention at all. You don't know what he looks like. You've been on the phone for three months. You want to apply for the Guinness Book of World Records? What kind of records do I apply for? Maybe there's some reason why he can't see you. Like he's in jail or in the hospital or something. He's too busy at work, I guess. What does he do? He said it's all administrative work. Office work. It's just common work, simple stuff. He said it doesn't suit him at all. What about you? You don't want to meet him? It's not that I don't want to. So, why don't you just ask him out to have a dinner? It's not that hard. I know. But I'm already comfortable with it right now. Well ... I guess he also wants to take it to the next level. He just doesn't know how to say it. Seriously? Yeah, I really lost to him. I see. - You know一 - You know一 I'm sorry, what were you trying to say? It's nothing, how about you? That's ... I mean ... What is it? I will say it bluntly. I might not be able to talk on the phone for the time being. Eh? I have to concentrate harder on my work. I see. Well, until the next time. Until the next time. Did you ever go to a wedding after-party? A friend of mine from college is getting married. I'm in charge of preparing for an after-party. What do you need to do to heat up the atmosphere? It's just bingo or something, isn't it? It's still six months away, though. It's so tiring when you getting married. I mean, the wedding. Mr. Fujima? Mr. Fujima? I'm sorry, my brother's such a stickler. No, I don't mind at all. It's just for work, though. He must have his own reasons. You mean he wants to change his job? Change his job? He's said before that office work doesn't suit him at all. Office work? He said that to you? Yeah, he said it was really a hard work. And he was a little bored. Office work, huh. Was I mistaken? Isn't there a world heavyweight boxing championship tomorrow? Look over there. Actually, my brother's always had an agenda. If the challenger wins he's going to confess to you. What are you talking about? What a stupid idea. Wait, I don't quite get it. He doesn't rely on himself, he just borrowing someone else's power. Borrowing someone else's power? I mean, what if that guy loses? He gives up? I really don't like this. Minako, it's not like that. I should go back to work. She's right. The data was almost always backed up. So, we were able to save it. We're able to rent a server of the same model again. Yes, it's a blessing in disguise. But you have to take some responsibility, too. Responsibility? You'll go out on the street and do a questionnaire to fill in the missing data. Do I have to do a questionnaire on the street? You put on coffee next to the computer when he's servicing it. I didn't put it there, I held it. That's even worse. So, what happened to Mr. Fujima? I gave him a few days of paid leave. I heard his wife left him. What? When he got home at night, his wife and his daughter were gone. His wife's family seems to be in Tokyo. Tokyo? His wife's phone is not working and he doesn't know where she's going. Could it be that he has a mistress? If that's the case, it makes sense. But it was so sudden that he couldn't figure it out. (Goodbye) Sorry, may I have a few minutes of your time? Could you please fill out a questionnaire for me? It's a punch from the right side! The cat is curled up into a ball on the usual couch Air conditioner blowing cool breezes The refrigerator buzzing Winston seems overwhelmed and unable to fight The champ drives him to the sideline with a barrage of heavy punches Dangerous, Winston facing a crisis, he can't move Winston has to defend himself The champ cracks the defense from the top The right, and also the left Winston keeps defending, but is forced to the corner of the ring Can he make it through this round with the constant barrage of punches? My girlfriend watching drama The future that I pictured back then is here now What should I say to myself when facing this moment? Should it be, “You did well” Or should it be, “Is this good enough?” I don't know what to say Last week my girlfriend said something to me out of the blue “Hey, why are we still together?” Little nights Almost as if they were too many to count And too many to remember It kept repeating many times Little nights Excuse me. Yes? I'm sorry to have a few minutes of your time. May I ask you to fill out a questionnaire for me? Okay. Is it really okay? So, no? Ah, no. Thank you very much. Winston punches back with a straight right to the champ's jaw He starts to move, right side followed by the left side The right punch that changes everything I don't see many of street questionnaires these days. Yeah, we usually do it online. What's this “Occupation” over here? It doesn't have to be specific. Employee or student or something like that. I'm looking for a job right now. Can I write “Freelance” instead? Of course it's okay. (Shampoo) Shampoo? There's a sale today. I wrote it down so I won't forget to buy it. I see. I'm done. Thank you for helping me. It must have been hard for you to stand up still all the time. Yeah, it's hard to sit still all the time, too. Indeed. Yeah. Bye. The situation is completely reversed Winston keeps landing jabs Now! He did it! The champion goes down and the referee starts the count Seven! Eight! It's all over! The new generation champion is born! He wins! The first Japanese world heavyweight champion in history Winston Ono! Does he win? It seems so. They're handing out championship belts right now Hello. Sorry, you must be upset this isn't Manabu. The challenger wins. Didn't see that coming. Manabu will probably call you late at night. Because he's busy with the champion's matters and all. What do you mean? My maiden name was Ono. Maiden name? So you're married? Didn't I tell you? I used to be called Ono Kasumi. Ono? My brother's name is Ono Manabu. And his name in the ring is Winston Ono. “Office work” sounds like “gym” or “boxing gym.” So, it's “Office work” as in “work” to make things happen. I can't lose this game for any reason. It's really nice to be able to win. Thank you all. Will you try to preserve the throne from now on? Well, I've got a bigger challenge ahead of me. She said she doesn't like fighting sports. So, I don't think she's watching this game right now. She's watching you now. My next challenge is meeting her. Ah, Fujima, are you feeling better now? I'm sorry for the inconvenience I have caused. Don't worry, Sato's got all the missing information. Unpaid overtime. What? Unpaid overtime? Of course. Mr. Fujima, are you all right? Sato, I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble. I'll buy you dinner next time. No, it's fine. The damage has been minimized and it's all complete. - Really? - Yes. May I ask? What happened to you? My wife's not home yet. I see. But, what happened yesterday gave me a lot of courage. Which one? Winning the game, it's amazing, isn't it? A Japanese man could be the champion of the world heavyweight boxing. I'm so touched. Look, it's the champion, Ono! It's Ono. Wow! Lift me too! Lift me too! All right, let's do it. Let's do it! Wait, it's not ready yet. I'm sorry, you guys know how selfish he is. I know. Have some, Ono. It's delicious. Why are you suddenly acting as if you know him? If you don't like it, you can kick his ass. That's okay. Mio, go protect your dad. Go! Come on! You're so strong, Mio! Ah, I got hits. - That's awesome. - Yeah. I never thought such a good guy could hit in the ring. I heard he used to get into a fight at the park. Oh, that's why you practice boxing? My sister dragged me to a boxing gym. But as a fighter ... if you're too nice, you'll have a weakness, right? I can't believe you're saying such nonsense in front of me. But it's true, I'm not cut out for boxing. The next fights will be the other challenges. And there'll be a stronger challenger. Ono, you have to keep your nerve. That's not very convincing coming from someone who's always got a lot of nerve. With a wife as wise as this, you must be crazy. That's correct, I must be crazy and it's all your fault. Whatever. Ah, Sato's too slow, isn't he? He made the champion wait for him. Could it be Miyamoto Musashi's lucky strategy? Sato, he's the one you mentioned before? I'm sorry, he's a college friend of ours. He said he really wants Ono's autograph. It's an honor. Thank you. I haven't seen your autograph yet. Not yet? Yes, what does it look like? I just write “Winston Ono” in one stroke. - One stroke? - Not bad. - Is it weird? - Not at all. No, I want one too. You can't do anything without your sister. Really. Don't move. Is that all you've got? - So weak! - Let go of me! - It will be dangerous if you keep moving. - Here you go. Hey! What are you guys doing? We are just playing. Just playing? Is that so? Right? Let's go. Are you okay? Who the heck those guys? They are from your school? Your nose is bleeding. Get some rest. What's wrong with him? Hey, hey! Wait up! Your nose is bleeding! Wipe it with this. Hello? I'm sorry. I'm in the neighborhood right now. Is this the kid who was being bullied? Nice to meet you. I'm Sato. I'm Ono. Sorry, I heard a fight, so I came along. Sorry for the trouble. - This guy is the world champion. - He's amazing. Hey, I'm talking to you. What's wrong with him? He's been like this since just now. Hey! What have you done? I was so worried. Your uniform's all dirty. You're getting a nosebleed. How many times have I told you not to get the uniform dirty? Is he your brother? Yeah. Your brother is so cold. My brother's ears aren't functioning well. Ears? He was in 1st grade when he suddenly lost his hearing. But now he can still hear some with his hearing aids. No wonder. Are you okay? What does that sign mean? It's sign language. It means “I'm okay.” Who are you? You are a professional wrestler? Not yet. I knew it, his classmates would bully him. They'd do it again someday, won't they? Can't you talk to the teachers? The teachers have known it. But, they are still kids, who are sneaking in behind the teachers' back. But you are also still a kid, aren't you? I'm not. Correct! Don't mind me. I can't hear what you will say anyway. There are things you can do even if you can't hear things well. Why don't you be a wrestler? Great! Hey, you really don't know him? He is Winston Ono. The world heavyweight boxing champion. What did you learn in school? Do you know him? Do you want to shake his hand? Handshakes. What the hell are you doing? Listen up, let me show you something. If anyone tries to bully you ... Let's see. Look at me. Slowly pick up a branch. Take your anger out on it and snap it in half. Like I do. Fold with all your might. If you scream, it'll be scarier. Champion, I'll leave it to you. Break it. You have to work hard in your next game. Okay, thanks. You want to give it to me? Yeah. Here you go. Thanks a lot. (For Mr. Fujima, From Winston Ono) I finally got to talk to my wife on the phone a while back. She's at her mother's in Tokyo. She must be there. My daughter watched the game. My daughter is a big fan of his. I should've gotten an autograph for your daughter, too. It's okay. This is enough. My daughter's surname is Fujima, too. She'll be happy to get this. Thank you. But it's good that you got in touch with your wife. Yeah. I thought that was the end of our relationship. So, I was glad we got to talk again. Mr. Fujima, I want to know. How did you and your wife meet? Why are you asking that? I've been interested in this kind of thing lately. How did people meet their girlfriends and wives. What's wrong with you? I will tell you but please don't laugh. But I'm sure you will laugh at me. I promise I won't. I was walking down the street and my wife came from the other side of the crosswalk. Then, she dropped her purse. I picked it up and gave it back to her. That's how I met her. That's not funny at all. I didn't mean to make you laugh. Just to prove that such encounters do exist. It's really quite amazing. Amazing, isn't it? I was shocked. Listen up, Sato. I mean, it's not important how do you meet. Listen up. When you look back later if you feel lucky to meet her there that's all the point. What do you mean? Like you just said. They met because his wife dropped her purse, didn't they? That means if it were any other woman he'd date and marry her too. Is that so? That's it. He just got caught up in a dramatic encounter. Who do you meet and do you feel comfortable with her or not it's all just a matter of luck. So, what are you trying to say? You're such a chatty. I will say it again more simply. You don't know who you're going to fall in love with, do you? When you look back and you're glad she was the woman you liked. You would think you've made the right decision. If it makes you feel that way it's more amazing than picked her purse, isn't it? It's not as easy as you think. You're such a mouthy. So, what you're trying to say is it doesn't matter if you have a dramatic encounter or not. Or is it just to show off? That counts. I'm back. (The first match to defend the championship is coming) I'm going to see the game with my daughter. Seriously? We spoke on the phone earlier, she said she's looking forward to it. But then I asked my wife about it. I found out that my daughter wanted to go, but she couldn't get the ticket. So, you got a grab? I got it on the auction site. It must be expensive. But you can't put a price tag on a precious moment like that. Will your wife be there too? I don't know, but I did ask her to come along. I've recently come to realize the reason she left me. The day before she left, I bought myself a shirt. Then? I came home, cut the tag off. I got the scissors out of the drawer to cut the tag off. And put the shirt in the closet. Doesn't sound like a problem, does it? But I took the scissors and left them there. Scissors? You know, the scissors that cut the tag. I didn't put it back in the drawer, I just left it on the dining room table. You are lying, aren't you? I'm not, I have done it all the time. Usually, my wife would remind me. Or puts it back quietly for me. But not this time. She did none of that. Maybe it's a pain in the butt. That's not what I mean. I don't think she would leave home because of that. The little things added up. Those slowly accumulating grievances. In her mind, it's swelling like a balloon. Then one day it suddenly exploded. Excuse me, may I ask you a question? If she weren't the one you did meet when you crossed the street would you still think she was the right one? Were you glad it was your wife who dropped the purse? Well ... I was glad it was her. I was so lucky. I wonder what your wife would think of that? I don't know and I don't want to know. Ask her, after the game. No way. It's for market research purposes. I don't want to. Cosmetics ... (Shampoo) Shampoo? There's a sale today. I wrote it down so I won't forget to buy it. I see. Little nights Though they were not dramatic The wind blowing slowly That's not bad It's already six months after the impressive match Here comes the defense of Japan's first world heavyweight boxing champion Winston Ono! Yumi! Yumi! The match starts tonight at 7 PM Good luck finding the right one this time. The right one? It's a great opportunity to find one while attending a friend's wedding. But, is it okay you can't make it to an after-party? I have two small children to look after. - What? - Nothing. We all admired you at the time, and we didn't expect you'd get married so soon and has become a great mother already. I also thought I'd be a late married woman and a workaholic type. I didn't expect this to happen. I didn't expect this to happen. Right? What are you guys talking about? I'd like to take a night out once in a while. You should do that once in a while. But my husband isn't helping at all. Whose husband is that? Don't worry, I'll go out for a good night on your behalf. Okay. We're off. Be careful on the way. See you later. Be careful of the little things that slowly can be added up. What do you mean? Whatever. I hope Sato meets the right one this time. I hope Sato meets the right one this time. Why didn't you take the main route? It's not my fault. This route was used to be closer to there. By the way, how are you going to drive later? You don't want to drink? I do want, I'll just take the car back tomorrow. That's good, let's just do it. Eh? The guard is a woman. How can you tell? Just take a look at the face. Eh? Huh? What's going on? What's wrong with you, Sato? Sato! Hey! Sato, what are you doing? We're running out of time. Are you listening to me? What are you looking for? Hey, Sato! I'm sorry to have a few minutes of your time. Yes? Well ... It must have been hard for you to stand up still all the time. Yeah, it's hard to sit still all the time, too. This shampoo ... This shampoo is really exquisite. I'm sorry for saying this in a place like this. Winston, hang in there! Hang in there! We met at the park in Sendai. My brother was upset because you lost the game. Please don't give him any false hope. (Ten years later) Good evening. Welcome. It's for one person? No, there are three of us. Do you smoke? He does. All right, there's a smoking dining room over there. Please wait there. Welcome. It looks delicious. Excuse me, one order of chicken karagee. Mine. Sorry for the wait. Sorry for the wait. Whose pork cutlet set meal is this? We didn't order any. Please wait a minute. So, you didn't order any pork cutlet set meal? That's okay, I'll just eat it. Excuse me. Is the meal all here? It is. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. You didn't' order it, did you? Yeah, so? You said you wanted to eat fish. Hello. Thank you for looking after me. Didn't you go golfing today? I don't want to live like him. Who is always smiling and taking it all in for fear of causing trouble. I'm not going to live my life groveling. You know, that's what I thought when I was in high school, too. Thought of we only live once. And thought of I was going to live my life to the fullest and be different. What are you talking about? All I'm saying is, you've had your thoughts on everyone. You're just playing the same old tune. Don't be so self-righteous. I know, I'll deliver it myself tomorrow. I'm not going to live like dad. I'm not going to be a little cog. Well, I'm telling you, don't underestimate the cogs. Everyone is basically a cog. The wasabi field is a reflection of an alder tree The sun is shining hotly When I plant the seeds out My hand gets stabbed by the needle The cold water is as sharp as the needle The rainbow on the back of my hand runs wild Stop! - Kimura. - Yes? Why do you always go out of tune when we get into this part? Do some exercise and try to sing it yourself. Why? “Why?” You're out of tune. What the point of the chorus competition really is? It's not about the point. It's about young people working together on something. That's what makes them feel relieved. Who's relieved? The adults. Just get it settle down on the competition day. Wait a minute, sir, you want to give up so soon? What else can we do? You want us to fight to the last minute in the exams, don't you? You can't compare exams to singing. Wow, how dare Kurume. Kurume is so brave. What? Kurume, would you like to accompany me? You'll be fine accompanying me for the rest of the day, won't you? Yeah, right. You quit the club too, didn't you? Well, yeah. Then please, I have something to discuss with you. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You haven't confessed to her yet, have you? Well, not yet. So, what's this all about? I don't know either. Wait! Hey! Someone like him. I can't believe it! This drives me crazy. These little nights in the middle of nowhere The cat is curled up into a ball on the usual couch Air conditioner blowing cool breezes The refrigerator buzzing My girlfriend watching drama The future that I pictured back then is here now What should I say to myself when facing this moment? Should it be, “You did well” Or should it be, “Is this good enough?” I don't know what to say Last week my girlfriend said something to me out of the blue (Bicycle, single-use, 60 yen) What are we going to discuss? I parked my bike here yesterday after I left school. I came back to pick it up and there was a blue sticker on it. Blue sticker? It warns me to pay 60 yen. You see, it's like that. You couldn't bear to spend 60 yen? It's not about that, my sticker got ripped off. Who ripped it off? That's why I need you to help me to find it out. I think the criminal is a repeat offender. Maybe that person trying to save money. Seems it's not the kind of person who can't pay the bills. It's a kind of person who thinks “Everyone's drunk, I wake up alone.” Using others to feel like they're the winners. It's just your speculation, isn't it? I'm absolutely sure about that. - I want to know ... - What? Why did you want me to accompany you? Why are you asking? Just wondering why you asked me for help. There are several reasons. The first is ... Hello. Hello. I have filled it out. Amiko can't make it because she's going to cram school today. I see. And the second is ... I've heard a lot about your father. My father? He's a godfather type, isn't he? Godfather type? I'll deliver it myself tomorrow. It'll be there in the morning. If your father's that tough ... you should be able to help me when I meet the criminal. Who told you that? I heard that all the boys in the class know about it. So, they told me not to get too close to you. Those bastards. But I was impressed. How can you be so gentle when your father is so serious and hardworking. I also wonder how. Hey, l have an idea. We just need to keep an eye on the ticket machine. Ticket machine? Those who didn't buy the stickers are criminals. Kurume, you're so clever. What kind of person is your father? He's the kind of person who has gotten where he is by relying on people to help him. He sounds pretty good. He doesn't. I still can't figure out how a loser like him could marry my mother. So, your mother's a completely different type? She doesn't criticize others. She does what she's supposed to do. And she's pretty, too. I hear she was a big hit when she was young. She had a lot of admirers. All she heard must be, “Please, choose me.” It's not an election campaign after all. Uncle! You just ripped off someone else's sticker, didn't you? What? What are you talking about? We are sorry. We don't need to apologize. I saw it with my eyes. And by the way, that was my sticker you ripped off yesterday. Don't give me that crap. What proof do you have? As I said, I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be any evidence? I'm warning you, don't make an adult looks bad! Hey, what are you doing? I'm sorry. Let go of me. You're so annoying. You've got too much time on your hands. It hurts, it hurts! Stop it, don't use violence. Stop it! Miss, mind your own business, okay? Sorry to interrupt ... What the heck? You have nothing to do with this. I don't think I have anything to do with it. I'm gonna leave as soon as I can. But I know who her father is. So, I'm worried if you kept yelling at her like that. If you knew who her father was, but yet you're still talking angrily like that ... You might be truly desperate later. Desperate? I'll take my leave. Miss, please don't tell your father that you met me today. Okay. Well, I'll be off then. Hey, wait! Well ... I get it. I'll pay for it. Who the hell he thinks my father is? He must be a big shot in their circles. He's just a pub manager. - I'm back. - Welcome back. Dad, you're here, working late today? Not much business in the pub today. My back hurt, so I came home. Are you a child? Where's mom? I don't know, I went to work late. Ah, yes. Sato's up to something. Up to something? Yeah, he even sent me a message saying I've made reservations at the Grand Hotel tonight. So, what is it? It must be a proposal. He's finally getting married. Getting married to Saki? Well, that's just the way it is. Pick a table with a nice view at night. And all of a sudden the music and the lights change. Then he takes out the ring and gets down on his knees and says, “Will you marry me?” And the staff and the customers go, “Wow,” and clap their hands. So, he must have prepared this kind of sappy surprise. I don't like that kind of surprise. Wouldn't you be touched? After all, it's just a design surprise for the self-indulgent. Correct! I'm back. Oh, you're back. You're home. I'm sorry, I'll cook in a minute. You don't have to do it right now. Just take a rest first. But I'm starving. Okay, okay, I'll cook it right now. Hey, what are you doing? It's my gem. Then just keep it hidden. Correct! It's delicious, isn't it? Yeah, it's delicious. Here's your bill. Okay. How much? I'll give you half. No, it's okay. Eh? I pay it with a credit card. Okay, I'll take your credit card. Ah, we're out of milk. I'll go buy some. Saki. What? That's ... You want me to get you something? Honestly ... I wanted to say it in the restaurant, but ... What's wrong? You're not feeling well? No, I'm feeling well. How should I put it. Since the first time we met it's been ten years, hasn't it? Yes, almost. So ... So? I guess it's about time. What do you mean? In short ... I want you to marry me. What do you think? Why didn't you say it just then? I thought it would be a nuisance for the others if I said it to you there. Nuisance? So, it means No, right? No, I didn't say so. It's just so sudden, I wish you'd let me think about it. That's all. So sudden? But we've been dating for 10 years. So, if we already dating for 10 years we have to get married? No, it's not like that. I feel like I'm getting confused. I'm the one who's confused. Why are we still together? Considering he had the belt for about one minute ten years ago. I thought he'd look a little bit older but he's got a baby face. I guess he didn't have any tough fights. But once he gets out of the ring with me that baby face is gonna be a thing of past. Mr. Ono, how do you feel about what he just said? I'm happy to be praised for having a babyface. This time you've got your chance to get back to the top to become a champion. In the last ten years, have you ever thought about retiring? I've always thought about it. But ... If I just gave up I thought people would be upset. Including the fighters I've beaten so far and all the people who have cheered me on. Please check this out. Sato is off today? Well, he said he's taking a paid leave. That's unusual. What happened? I don't know either. But he said he didn't want you to go out on the street and do a questionnaire. Do a questionnaire on the street? (I'm sorry, I'm going to stay at my home for a while) Oh, my God, it's Winston Ono. He's so cool. Saki, take a look, it's Winston Ono's autograph. It's the real thing. It's from when he was a world champion 10 years ago. He signed it for Amiko. I used to be a big fan of him, and I went to his final game. But too bad he lost. But the surname ... Ah, my parents are divorced. They were separated at that time. This was a special order from a junior at my dad's company. He did it just for me. He's such a nice person. I'm not going. Don't say that. Minako got us tickets. I'm home. Welcome home, go take a shower first. Just ask Kazuki to go. I have told you he's having a baseball game on that day. Then you go. I can't go if Kazuki is home. I'm starving, dinner's not ready yet? Take a shower first! You can also go hang out to Harajuku. I want to go to Harajuku, but not with dad. There are three tickets. You can go with your friend. But dad's coming, so I'm not going. So, who's your dad going with? He'll be fine on his own. Just go with him, he's been really looking forward to it. Mom, why do you always have to protect that man? Mio, I'll get mad if you keep this up. I don't know what you're mad about. I'm just saying I don't want to go! Mio! Eh? It's you, Sato. Eh? Mio? There's so much I can't figure out in my house, I'm tired. Can't figure it out? You mean your dad? Of course. My mom, too. What does she think is so great about my dad? The first time I heard about it, I was shocked. Yumi, who was admired by everyone dating such a guy. You didn't make a move on my mom, did you? Of course, I didn't. Yelled to her, “Please, choose me” all the time. What's with what? But soon after I was glad she chose Oda. Why? Because ... when he found out Yumi was pregnant with you, he didn't hesitate at all. He decided to withdraw from school without hesitation. And started working at pub. Thank you for waiting. Enjoy your food. This is your order, vegetable salad. - Waiter, I want to order. - Yes? When I saw he's so hard working I thought he was really something. I couldn't compete with him at all. In the end ... when you look back later and you feel lucky to meet her there, that's all the point. What do you mean? That's what he told me before. The most important thing is, you'll thank yourself later. You're glad and lucky enough to meet her. What about you, Sato? What? What about yourself? Are you glad that you met Saki? How long is “later” exactly? I'm back. I'm back. You're back. You must be hungry, right? I'll heat up dinner. Huh? Dad's home? He said he had a stomachache, so he came back earlier. Again? Is he a child? He's so unpredictable. Mom, let me ask you something. What is it? What do you think dad is like? What do you mean? Are you glad you met and married him? Let's see. I may not be able to express myself very well. Our family consists of dad, mom, Mio, and Kazuki. I really like that kind of combination. He's not that bad. Even though he's a total weirdo he's not that stupid or annoying. If you want to know did I meet the right one I think he's the right one. I see. Why? You have a crush on someone? Why do you say that? Because you're suddenly asking some strange questions. Thanks for the meal. I'm going to marry Kato Yumi. What? I haven't told anyone yet. Marry? Congratulations. We're expecting a baby. But she's also talking about taking a break from school and doing a part-time job. My life should be good. You didn't get her pregnant on purpose, did you? Of course not. It was purely an accident. But it's great. These things have helped me a lot. Helped you a lot? Because, thanks to that, I'm able to have such a relationship with her. And makes our relationship very, very strong. Why are you suddenly burning English? Correct! Just saying. Morning. My mother let me go to see the boxing match with you. That's great. I can't wait to go to Harajuku. Me, too. But you really want to see it with me? Don't you want to see it with Kurume? Why it should be Kurume? Because you two seem to be getting along so well lately. Do we? Didn't you guys go home together last time? Because we were going in the same direction. Just because of that? Morning. Morning. Morning. Oda, are you free after school today? Do you want to go for ice cream again? I'm sorry, I can't go out with you. I start working today. Huh? Where is it? I'll check it out. You don't have to. Amiko, let's go. He said he's coming to see you work. So cute. The wasabi field is a reflection of the alder tree The sun shining hotly When I plant the seeds out My hand gets stabbed by the needle The cold water is as sharp as needle My next challenge is meet her. I heard you actually met her after that. And confessed to her. Yes. Did you decide to confess to her if you won the game? Yeah, I did. There's been a rumor going around, that woman is your current wife. Is that true? Yes, it's all true. It took us a long time to get married. After I lost my first match as a champion. I couldn't win a match for a while. And I was at rock bottom. Your wife was there for you. Yes, she was. I was really grateful to her for that. Coming up on this Sunday The world heavyweight boxing championship It will be airing on our channel Huh? Saki, you're also taking this bus? Well, my hometown is on this line. Are you going to work? Yeah, how about you? I'm going to Tokyo with my friend. Huh? The boxing match will be held today? Yes. Winston, I'm counting on you, Winston! So, if the challenger wins and he has to confess? What a stupid idea. Does she know about it? She should have known it. It's already become hearsay all over the class. But it would be so complicated to confess like that, wouldn't it? You think so? But still, it'll be fun, right? But it feels like borrowing someone else's power, don't it? If you like her, just say it out loud. Some things are just so hard. So, have you ever experienced this kind of thing? As you get older ... you get more used to many things. And sometimes you don't even know what to do with yourself. So, you look for an opportunity. Or need a little push back. That's so normal. Honestly you just have to go with what you're feeling. Ten years ago, I never imagined this day would come. There were some things I didn't realize until I've lost the game. I kept winning the game that I wouldn't realize what was important. Tonight, it's the same day and the same ring as ten years ago Winston Ono will once again challenge the world championship I'll be off. You have worked hard today. I don't think about what comes after. I just want to focus on this game first. Let's go. The future I pictured back then is here now What should I say to myself when facing this moment? This is the challenger, Winston Ono He won his first gold belt ten years ago That's what happened at the Tokyo International Gymnasium ten years ago Fans in the stadium and across the country have been waiting for this for a long time For ten years, he's believed in himself, believed in boxing Little nights Almost as if they were too many to count And too many to remember It kept repeating many times Little nights The game is about to start The gong has been sounded Wait for me, Saki. Saki! Saki, wait! Go, go, go! Come on, get up! Get up! Ono! Get up! Please, get up! Come on, get up! Winston, get up! The referee continues to count He keeps counting and stops on the count of eight Will he continue to fight? Round 5 is over The gong sounds, but he can't move Winston can't move his legs but he's intent on continuing That's good Saki! How about the left eye? Can you see with your left eye? Get up and fight on! Okay, let's go. I'm okay. Are you okay? You okay? What's going on? Mom! What happened? Want to see boxing game? What are you doing here? I don't think you were supposed to get off at this stop, didn't you? How did you get all the way here? After that night ... I thought about a lot of things. Ten years ago today. You helped me with the questionnaire on the bridge. If it weren't you, but someone else then ... I bumped into that person a few days later I'd probably start dating her. Living with her. And then proposing to her lamely like a fool. But ... when I living alone for a while, apart from you. Finally, I feel so clear. I was glad I met you there at that time. I meant that from the bottom of my heart. Ten years have passed since then. I'm glad the woman I like is you. Even until right now, I still feel the same. I had to say that tonight, no matter what. You've come all this way and that's all you've got to say? Yeah. The bus is coming. You can take this bus, right? Eh? Yeah. Don't drive away yet. Wait. Open the door, please. Sorry, just a minute. Saki, come on, hurry up. Wait. I'm sorry for the trouble. Sato, that night I didn't give you an answer ... Just take your time and think about it properly. I'm in no hurry. - But ... - See you. Good night. I still can't accept it. But it's good to have a good game. It was great, I was so impressed. You dropped something. Sorry, you dropped this. Winston Ono lands the fatal blow The punch time is judged after the fight Therefore a second challenge for the world champion ten years later it ended in failure No, Winston. What am l supposed to do? See you tomorrow. See you. Are you okay? Kurume? I've got a part-time job to do. I should get going now. Yes. May I ask what happened to you? My girlfriend. She's not back yet. I see. But what happened yesterday gave me a lot of courage. Which one? The heavyweight boxing game. It was great, even though I didn't see it. What do you mean? Hello? It's been a while. I'm sorry I called you out of the blue. It's okay. You're still in Tokyo, aren't you? How are you? I'm fine. Can we talk now? Yes, what is it? It's been ten years since then, I guess you've probably forgotten about that. I asked her, was she glad she met me. Met you? It's about me and my wife. Ah, yes. The day when you picked up her purse. We had a phone conversation yesterday after so long. And I finally got to the point where I could ask. You wanted to know what she thought, didn't you? Yeah, I remember it now. Did she say she's glad it was you who picked her purse? She did not. So, she didn't say that? She said a thing. She said she dropped it on purpose. What? She said, “I made you pick it up on purpose.” That's a great answer. I'm old enough to have found that fact out. Okay. Good evening. Welcome. It's for one person? There'll be two more coming in a minute. Three people in total. Sorry, can I wait for them in the smoking dining room? - Ah so, the room over there. - Okay. What is this? Isn't teriyaki just teriyaki chicken? Why did you get the chicken and the fish wrong? I'm really sorry. I'll get a new one for you right now. I want you to explain what this is all about. You've made a mistake and you're asking to redo it. Are you wasting my time? I'm starving to death. I'm really sorry. So, you're just apologizing and that's all? You probably just want to get rid of your mistake, don't you? Am I right? I'm really sorry. How are you going to compensate me? Sorry to interrupt. What? you have nothing to do with this. I don't think I have anything to do with it either. I'm going to leave as soon as I can. But do you know who her father is? What do you mean? If you knew who her father was, but yet you're still talking angrily like that you might be truly desperate later. Desperate? What do you mean by that? I'll take my leave then. Miss, please don't tell your father that you met me today. I'm sorry. There's something else. I have always wanted to tell you this. I like you. So, I'll be going now. I'm back. Welcome back. Welcome back, too. I'm back. It's okay, isn't it? Okay what? It's okay, isn't it? What is it? Getting married. It's okay if we getting married, isn't it? Is it really okay? Do you think it's not okay? Please marry me. Yes. I will be in your care.

Should it be, “You did well” Or should it be, “Is this good enough?” I don't know what to say Last week my girlfriend talked to me out of the blue “Hey, why are we still together?” Little nights Almost as if they were too many to count And too many to remember It kept repeating many times Little nights Though they were not dramatic The wind blowing slowly That's not so bad These little nights in the middle of nowhere I walk into my room, and turn on my computer It doesn't matter anymore It really doesn't matter anymore I'm tired of unimportant news Like living in America, or learning English or whatever There's a time when all I can think about is “Why we are still together?” It just keeps spinning round in my head I need to find someone who's destined to be with me There's no doubt about it tonight Little nights Almost as if they were too many to count And too many to remember It kept repeating many times Little nights Though they were not dramatic Though they were not the best That's not so bad Little nights Almost as if they were too many to count And too much to handle I'm stacked Little nights Though they were not dramatic But if I could be there for you That's not so bad There's really nothing bad with that
