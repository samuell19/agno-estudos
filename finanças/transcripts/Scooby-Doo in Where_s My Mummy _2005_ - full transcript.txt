[♪♪♪] SOLDIER: Centurions, forward! [YELLS] [BOTH SCREAMING] WOMAN: In the year 41 B.C.E., as the Roman army invaded Egypt, I, Cleopatra, last of the Pharaohs, escaped upon the River Nile. My kingdom had fallen, yet I was still Egypt's queen. Vowing to defend the ancient treasure of my people, I sailed for the pyramids. There, beneath the Great Sphinx, lay a hidden tomb. An impenetrable maze of deadly traps and secret dangers, forever guarded by an ancient horror. The army of the undead. A thousand mummified warriors awaiting the call to rise from the grave and defend Egypt's last great treasure. The ancient traps were set. And the tomb sealed. Under the golden crown of Isis, I cast my curse. The curse of Cleopatra! Let it be written! [♪♪♪] [CHIRPING] Jinkies. It's so beautiful. But what's it doing up here? [WORKERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Wait till Omar sees this. Not to worry, uncle. The Sphinx will be finished in time for the unveiling ceremony. The restoration is in very good hands. [WIND GUSTING] Whoa! Ugh! Omar! Look, I found something. It looks like an ancient necklace. What an incredible find. Oh, it was nothing. [♪♪♪] Impossible. VELMA: Look. Velma, you found it. The lost tomb of Cleopatra. Hidden for thousands of years. [GASPS] Cleopatra? [GASPS] Double jinkies. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. Man, Scoob, Egypt's a real hot spot. [CHUCKLES] Guess while the lemonade is chilling, we'll just have to chill. Yeah. [LAUGHS] FRED: Wow. How cool is it that Velma has spent the last six months here in Egypt? Well, restoring the Great Sphinx may be a thrill, but I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees us. Yeah. "Surprise, Velma!" Velma? Surprise? Where, where? Sorry, Scooby. False alarm. Oh. FRED: Hang in there, big guy. We miss her too. But the good old Mystery Machine will have us there in a jiffy. [METAL GRINDS] [ENGINE POPPING] DAPHNE: You were saying? [ENGINE RATTLES, DIES] Huh, like, why are we stopping? Big trouble, gang. It looks like our radiator's out of water. [LAUGHS] Don't sweat it, Fred. Scoob and I will go looking for snacks. I mean, help. Yeah, and snacks too. [COUGHING] SHAGGY: Water, water. Oh-ho-ho! We're doomed, Scoob. We're doomed. Doomed? [HOWLS] [SIGHS] Our heroes. Hey, Scooby, look at that. Huh? Like, we're saved. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Saved! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! [♪♪♪] Do you think we should tell them that it's only a mirage? BOTH: Yuck! Oh. Too late. [SIGHS] [GROANS WEAKLY] [BIRD SCREECHING] SCOOBY-DOO: Uh, Shaggy. Oh. Vultures. Vultures? Oh-ho-ho-ho. Who would've thought it could end like this? Scooby and Shaggy, oh-ho-ho, a baked buffet for a buzzard's breakfast. [SHAGGY WHINES] Wait a minute. That's no vulture. It's a hawk. [HAWK SHRIEKS] Guys, look. I think we've got company. [CAMEL SNORTS] [SPEAKS IN ARABIC] In Egypt, that means hello. What up? That means hello in America. DAPHNE: Are we glad to see you. [CAMEL SNORTS] Indeed. I am Amahl Ali Akbar, at your service. Amahl Ali Akbar? Wow, that's some name. Do you mind if we just call you Triple A? FRED: We were on our way to the Sphinx, when our van overheated. Do you know where we might find some water? I am sorry, my friend, but there is no water here. Jeepers. What are we going to do? Come. Join my caravan. We travel east, towards the flowing waters of the Nile River. There you will find what you are looking for. [HAWK SCREECHES] [CAMEL SNORTS] FRED: How much further to the Nile River? This is the Nile River. DAPHNE: Okay. So, what happened to the "river" part? [CAMEL GRUNTS] ALI AKBAR: Our journey together has come to an end. I must find water for my camels. But how are we supposed to get to the Sphinx? You have already arrived, my friend. It is just over that hill. Big statue, pyramids in back. You can't miss it. Well, thanks, Triple A. Hope we see you again. If the fates allow it, so shall it be. FRED: Okay, everybody, remember where we parked. [ALARM BEEPS] FRED: We made it, gang. The pyramids and the Sphinx of Giza. SCOOBY: Ooh. SHAGGY: Isn't that cool? DAPHNE: Wow. SHAGGY: Oh, man. SCOOBY: That's a big cat. DAPHNE: What a strange statute. It has the head of a man, but the body of a lion. [LAUGHS] Good thing we're in the desert, eh, Scoob? It must take a lot of sand to fill that kitty's litter box. [LAUGHS] Litter box. [GASPS] Okay, tape is rolling. In five, four, three... Welcome to Fear Facers, the show that looks in the face of fear and faces it. I'm your host, Rock Rivers. Behind me, the Nile River. No relation. Wow, Fear Facers is the coolest! I'm your biggest fan. Ugh! Cut. No, really. I've seen every episode. Come on, bro. I'm losing the light. Guys, this is Rock Rivers. Every week he travels to the world's scariest places, looking for video proof of the supernatural. Uh, like, by "supernatural," I sure hope he means extra-organic granola. DAPHNE: Did you say Fear Facers? It's okay. You can tell me. You love my show, and you watch it every week. Am I right? Uh, no. But I do read TV Gab. Look. FRED: Fear Facers cancelled? Okay, so I faked some footage. Big deal. The ratings were huge. So, what are you doing in Egypt? Yeah, there's no fear for you to fake here. You mean, you don't know about...the curse? BOTH: The curse? [WHIMPERING, TEETH CHATTERING] It's all over the Internet. They've discovered a secret chamber under the Sphinx. And unleashed some majorly sick mojo. Like, I think my mojo is going to be majorly sick. Yeah. Mine too. If the curse is real, I'll get proof of it on tape, and then they'll have to put me back on TV. [SNIFFS] Huh? Ah-ha! DAPHNE: What's gotten into Scooby? I think he's picked up something on the old nose radar. Come on. Hey, at least run screaming. For the camera. D'oh! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! [CRASHING, BANGING] Huh? Hey! Scooby! How did you get here? Okay, okay. I'm glad to see you too. Guys! Wow. What a surprise. I told you she'd be surprised. Boy, am I. But, uh, what are you doing here? Well, you know Scooby. Ha-ha. He wouldn't stop howling until we agreed to come and visit you. [HOWLS] Scooby, are you sure it was me you missed? Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks. Scooby-Dooby-Doo. And, like, I missed you too, Velma. And Shaggy too. [LAUGHS] Isn't it great? The gang's back together again. Ooh, and Velma, what a cute necklace. Oh, well, it's not really mine. It's an ancient Egyptian symbol called an ankh. Someday, it will go to a museum, where it belongs. I don't really think it goes with my outfit. Are you kidding? Everything goes with khaki. OMAR: Velma, what is going on here? You know this site is closed. We must have no more intruders. It's okay, Omar. These are my friends from America. Oh, can it be? The teenage sleuths with whom you've enjoyed so many adventures? Gang, this is Prince Omar Karam. He's the one in charge of the restoration of the Sphinx. OMAR: Please, forgive my rudeness. Ever since our discovery, we have been besieged by treasure hunters. FRED: Treasure? Wow. DAPHNE: Can we see what else you found? Yes, of course. But first, let me introduce you to a close friend of mine. Khafre Ra-Atum. Or if you prefer, the Great Sphinx of Giza. Carved out of the living rock over 4000 years ago. Hey, Daph, get a shot of this. Freddy. So, Your Highness, is there really a secret chamber beneath the Sphinx? And what's all this about a curse? SHAGGY: La-la-la BOTH: La-la-la-la-la-la... We're not listening. Uh-uh. No way. We're not listening. Not listening. Guys, what are you doing? Like, we know where this is going. You've discovered some ancient tomb and unleashed a horrible curse. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Like, no offense, Your High-heightliness, but we don't wanna hear it. BOTH: La-la-la-la-la-la-- Wait, wait, hold on, guys. What's that sound? [HELICOPTER DRONING] Jeepers, did somebody order a SWAT team? Just as I feared. Velma, we must act quickly. Ah, the Great Sphinx. Nice kitty. Purr for mama. [GASPS] Dr. Amelia von Butch. Amelia von who? Butch. She's a notorious archaeologist and world-class treasure hunter. You mean treasure thief. This is Prince Omar. I must speak with my uncle. Hey! I'm sorry, but your call has been disconnected. Permanently. VON BUTCH: Secure the perimeter. We work alone. Dr. von Butch, you must leave here at once. And you are...? Prince Omar Karam. I am in charge of this excavation. [CACKLES] A prince. Charming. Now, out of the sandbox, kids. Playtime is over. VELMA: Wait, you can't go in there. Watch me. Hello, gorgeous. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] FRED: This is awesome. DAPHNE: Jeepers, who is that? The greatest woman who ever ruled. Cleopatra, last of the Pharaohs. Atop her head, she wears the golden crown, and around her neck, the ruby ankh necklace. Oh, Velma. That's just like your-- [CLEARS THROAT] I mean, wow, and I thought I knew how to accessorize. The tomb itself is sealed. Imagine. The crown of Cleopatra waits beyond this door. [BEEPING] OMAR: Please wait. We have translated the hieroglyphics. "Thus spoke Cleopatra: "'A curse on those who would defile the secret tomb of the Pharaohs.'" VON BUTCH: "'The Nile will fall, and the desert will rise. "'The army of the undead will awaken, and all who enter will be turned into stone.'" [CACKLES] [CREW LAUGHS] "The Nile will fall." Freddy, we saw the river ourselves. It was completely dry. But what does "the desert will rise" mean? [GULPS, TITTERS] And, like, "awaken the army of the undead." Let's hope they have a snooze button. Yeah. [WHIMPERS] Nice try, Cleo, but we didn't come all this way to leave empty-handed. If there is an undead army down there, our equipment will detect them. And they won't be undead for long. OMAR: Please, Dr. von Butch, in the name of archaeology, let us treat this tomb with respect. Its secrets will be revealed in time. I couldn't agree more. And there's no time like the present. She has just destroyed 2000 years of history. Don't worry, Omar. If the curse can't stop her, we will. [FAINT, RASPY SCREAMING] Like, that's the spookiest stay-fresh seal I've ever heard. Yeah, me too. [WIND GUSTING] Hey, doc, I think you better come check this out. Jeepers, what is that? SHAGGY: Somebody tell me that's just another mirage. Sandstorm. "And the desert will rise." It is the curse. Okay, like, somebody else tell me it's a mirage. Unload, now. We need the geothermal sensors. No. We must take shelter. Everybody, back inside the tomb. [OMAR SCREAMS] Shaggy, Scooby, where are you? We don't know, but when we figure it out, we'll send you a postcard. Hoo-hoo. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but, man, am I glad to be back inside this creepy tomb. Me too. Hey, Omar. Boy, are we glad to see you. Wow, like, talk about giving a guy the cold shoulder. Zoinks! He's been t-t-turned-- Turned to stone! St-s-s-stone? Guys, what are you doing? We're heading out into the nice, safe sandstorm. But why? Just look over there. Prince Omar and the Rock of Gibraltar could be second cousins. Oh, no. Omar! Jeepers, he's been turned into a royal statue. [VON BUTCH GASPS] Impossible. How can this be? It's just like it said in the curse. Hm. "And all who enter will be turned to stone." We tried to warn you. Now look what you've done. We've got to do something. Stick with the plan. I'm switching to night vision. Copy that. We are live. Awaiting your signal, Dr. von Butch. Dr. von Butch? Doc, it's now or never. All right. On my signal. No. What's it gonna take to stop you? Nothing short of an army. Move out. It's all downhill from here. But it doesn't make sense. Why would the curse strike Omar? He only wanted to protect the tomb. Well, gang, it looks we've got another mystery on our hands. No, Freddy, we don't. ALL: What? I'm sorry, gang, but it's just too dangerous this time. If something were to happen to you guys, I'd never forgive myself. Hold on. Did Velma just say that we're not going to try to solve a mystery? Ha-ha-ha. Like, I still must have sand in my ears. But what about Omar? We can't just leave him like this. Come on, Velma. We've got to follow them down into the tomb. Maybe we can find a way to reverse the curse. Hm... At least we've got Omar's journal. It could help guide us safely through the chambers. Okay, gang, let's go in. SHAGGY: Good idea. And while you guys do that, Scoob and I will keep Prince Omar company. Ha-ha. Hey, Scoob, how 'bout a round of Go Fish? Yeah. FRED: No way, guys. There's no splitting up this time. Like Velma said, it's too dangerous. We're better off if we stick together. SHAGGY: Man, that's one steep drop, Scooby-Doo. I wonder how far down it goes. SCOOBY: I don't know. [ECHOING] I don't know... I don't know... I don't know... [WHIMPERS] Hey, like, where'd everybody go? [ECHOING] Where'd everybody go? Where'd everybody go? SHAGGY: Wait for us! Nobody move. This is the first trap. Jeepers. That doesn't look like Cleopatra. It's not. That's the Egyptian goddess Isis. Her power protects Cleopatra's tomb. SHAGGY: Like, gangway! Shaggy, Scooby, wait! [VELMA YELLS] Guys, don't move. The floor is a trap. [WHIMPERS] Just our luck, Scoob. Out of the frying pan and into the microwave. Move! [BOTH WHINING, YELLING] [BOTH GRUNT] Scoob, where are you? Mm... Well, how do you like that? Instead of King Tut, I found King Mutt. [LAUGHS] King Mutt. [LAUGHS] DAPHNE: Guys, are you okay? I think so, but we'd be better if we had more sandwiches. They're okay. This way. Scooby, Shaggy, stay right there. So much for not splitting up. Yeah. [SENSORS BEEPING] MAN: Hold on. We got something here. WOMAN: There's movement all around us. Whoa. Look at all these creepy coffins. Hey, Scoob, do you know who tucks a mummy into bed at night? Uh-uh. His mummy. [GIGGLES] [PHANTOM GROWLING] Hey, that might not be my best joke, but you don't have to groan about it. Shaggy. Not now, Scoob. Can't you see I'm working on my junior-archaeology merit badge? [RASPY GROWL] [GROWLING] [WHIMPERS] Like, run for it, Scoob! [GROWLING AND SCREAMING] [FAINT SCREAMING] Listen. It's Shaggy and Scooby. They're in trouble. Guess what? [GULPS] So are we. [GROANING AND GROWLING] The army of the undead. [SCREAMING] They're everywhere. [GROWLS] Fall back. [GRUNTS] Wow, she's good. Freddy, look out!

First Omar and now Velma. Which one of us is next? FRED: We're not beat yet, Daphne. Here, you carry the necklace. I'll take the journal. But what about Shaggy and Scooby? We're gonna find them and solve this mystery. Oh, Scooby-Doo, where are you? [♪♪♪] Whoa! Whoa! [BOTH WHINING] Ah! Ah! [WHIMPERING] Goodbye, cruel whirlpool. [WHIMPERING] Huh? Hey, Scoob. You gotta see this. [CHUCKLING] I think we're finally out of danger. Like, zoinks! Rroww? [ALL GASP] All hail the great Ascoobis. He has returned. ALL: Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. MAN: Silence! What is the meaning of this outrage? Almighty Hotep, the Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned. Really? Where? I think they're talking about you, Scooby-Doo. Me? It as the prophecy foretold. Our great Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned to us. Along with Shagankhamen, his lanky man-servant. Like, I hate to break it to you guys, but we're not really-- HOTEP: Enough! The prophecy has been fulfilled. We must prepare a great banquet. Banquet? Banquet? That's right. Like, he's Ascoobis, and just call me Shagankhamen. [CROWD CHEERS] [♪♪♪] Shaggy? Scooby? Oh, this place is awful. RIVERS: That's it, fear. Show fear on your faces! Rock Rivers. Is that you? Don't talk to the camera. Scream in terror. I knew it. You've been behind this mystery all along. No way, I'm on the real this time. Come on, I'll show you. See, I couldn't fake this. [DAPHNE GASPS] It's the entire undead army. FRED: Gosh, this must be their secret burial chamber. Heh, it's almost too grody, even for me. Jeepers, look at all of them. RIVERS: That's it. Now, take a close look at their dried-up skin and freak out. Come on, show me the mummy. But it doesn't make sense. These mummies are still covered in cobwebs. How could they have been chasing us? Yeah. They don't look like they've moved since the day they were buried. Hey. Check out this gnarly scroll. See the ancient text, no doubt written in blood. DAPHNE: Eww. [GASPS] Freddy, look. It's the ankh necklace. I'll translate the ancient writing. "Help. The heavy tourist is pinching my kitten." Uh, how 'bout, "The necklace is the key to the curse"? Ooh. Even better. This is the key to the curse? But what does that mean? It means the necklace is mine. Hand it over and nobody gets hurt. Back off. I know judo. D'oh! Hey. I didn't say ready. MAN: Hold it. We've got company. WOMAN: Who dares disturb my secret tomb? [GASPS] Jeepers, the ghost of Cleopatra. Awesome. Behold, she who commands you. Leave this place and never return. Cough up the crown, and we'll go. Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Cleopatra. Bring it, sister. Now, suffer my swarming vengeance. [CACKLES] Locusts. We have to get out of here. Ahh. I don't understand. The curse didn't say anything about locusts. No, but you got to admit: it's pretty Egyptian. Freddy, come on. What about Velma and Omar? It's no use running around in the tombs. We need to find some help. DAPHNE: I just hope Scooby and Shaggy are okay. CROWD: Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. All hail the prophecy. The great Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned. Mmm-mmm. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Ascoobis. Just one question. Like, where have you guys been all our lives? Welcome to the lost city of the ancient ones. We have come here from many lands, choosing to live according to the ways of the Pharaohs of old. That means no TV, no computers. And no fast food. Huh? Wow. So you guys are, like, seriously old school. We prefer the magic and the mystery of ancient Egypt to the ways of the modern world. You know what would be really magical? Some extra scoops of this and another dozen of that. [WHISPERING] With chocolate sauce. Yeah, yeah. As Ascoobis wishes. [SNAPS] If only Pharaoh Ascoobis knew the rest of the prophecy. Isn't that right, my pet. [CACKLES] [STOMPING, SNORTING] [SNARLS] [GASPS] This desert is huge. How are we ever going to find Shaggy and Scooby? Well, maybe to find them, we have to think like 'em. Okay, ask me questions, and I'll answer as Shaggy and Scooby. Um, okay, Shaggy. If you made it out of the Sphinx, where would you go? [AS SHAGGY] Like, man, anywhere there's food. Wow. That's pretty good. Now do Scooby. Where is the best place to grab a bite to eat? [SNIFFS] [AS SCOOBY-DOO] Uh, that way. [GIGGLES] [♪♪♪] FRED: Wow. This bazaar is really... bizarre. But I got a great deal on a new bag. Daphne, we're supposed to be solving a mystery, not shopping. I bought it to keep the necklace safe. Besides, it goes great with these shoes. Still no sign of Shaggy and Scooby. I thought for sure we'd find 'em here. Daphne, look out! Oh! Hey, pal, what's the big idea? Freddy, run. [GASPS] [♪♪♪] I'm warning you, pal. I'm a champion arm wrestler. Ooh! [COUGHS] Eww. That is the cheapest perfume I ever... [MUMBLES] Daphne. D'oh! Huh? [CACKLES] [♪♪♪] [MOANS] Oh, my head. [GROANS] Come on, Mom, it's Saturday. Oh. Uh, hi, Triple A. [GASPS] Where are we? ALI AKBAR: We are atop the Great Pyramid of Khufu. You will be safe here. Uh, did I forget to mention that I'm afraid of heights? We've got bigger problems than heights, Freddy. Such as losing your friends. [GASPS] Shaggy and Scooby. Do you know where they are? I have a friend who is, shall we say, looking into it. [SCREECHES] Ah, here he comes now. [GASPS] Scooby's collar. So they did make it out of the tomb. Excellent work, Horus. Now, tell me, where did you find this? [SCREECHES] We must travel north, by the stars. Nothing can stop me now. Soon Cleopatra's golden crown will be mine. [CACKLES] Oh, please. You'll get your cut. Now, get down there and find what we came for. [♪♪♪] Rroww? [CHEERING] Wow! It's some kind of sports arena. And the place is packed. Hey, do you think maybe they played baseball in ancient Egypt? Oh, boy. I hope so. HOTEP: Loyal subjects of the lost city, you have chosen to follow me in the ways of ancient times. But now, as foretold in prophecy, the Pharaoh Ascoobis has returned. [CHEERING] Hey, Scoob. Like, here come the ancient peanut vendors. Great seats, huh. We're number one. We're number one. Ah, I guess it must be shield and spear night. Yeah. [GIGGLES] And now, it is time for the great Ascoobis to fulfill the prophecy by making a sacrifice of himself to the all-powerful spirit of the sand. [CHEERING] Gulp. Wha--? What did he just say? [GRUNTING] [SNARLS] Like, why do I get the feeling that this isn't the home team's dugout? [CROWD SCREAMS] Rroww! Zoinks!

[WHISPERS] Not now, Freddy. We're just wrappin' up here. ALI AKBAR: He is a Armin Granger, a brilliant civil engineer, who has been illegally damming the Nile River. [CROWD GRUMBLING] Like, that's how we got here. He must have stolen the water from the Nile to bring it into the city. And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling phony Pharaohs. [CROWD YELLING] So, like, was it just dumb luck that Scoob and I happened to fit the prophecy profile? ALI AKBAR: There's no such thing as dumb luck, my friend. I believe fate brought you here for a special purpose. Really? Like, maybe it was to solve a mystery all by ourselves. [GIGGLING] Won't Velma be proud. Yeah. [GIGGLING] Velma? Hey. Like, where is she? [SCOOBY-DOO WAILING] It just doesn't add up. If the Nile ran dry because of Hotep's scheme, could the curse of Cleopatra be a hoax, after all? Hoax? Like, tell that to poor Velma, turned to stone, and meanwhile, we're living the good life. Well, except for that giant scorpion part. [WAILS] Oh, poor Scooby. Listen to him. He's heartbroken. [WHIMPERING] I've got something that might cheer you up. Recognize this? Mmm. Ahh, Scooby-Doo. [GASPS] The ankh necklace. It was in my new bag. Where is it? I'm afraid the thieves who attacked you did not go away empty-handed. Then they've must have known what they were stealing. [GASPS] Amelia von Butch. She knew the necklace was the key to the curse. If Amelia has the necklace, we might never be able to turn Velma and Omar back. [SOBS] They'll be cold stone forever. Hang on, Shag. I think I feel a plan coming on. FRED: Okay, gang, we're all set. Daphne, you know what to do. Scooby and Shaggy, you two follow me. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Scooby, wait. I said follow me. Don't worry, Fred. I'll be hiding right behind you the whole time. [♪♪♪] [SCOOBY SNIFFING] Rroww? Yikes! It's Rock Rivers. The curse has claimed another victim. Rock Rivers is solid... rock. [FOOTSTEPS] Listen, guys. It must be the undead army. They're close by. Ooh, not again. Like, for once in my life, I don't want my mummy. Keep out of sight. Let me go. They've got Dr. von Butch and her gruesome twosome. [GRUNTING] FRED: And she's wearing the ankh necklace. Okay, guys, it's time for phase two. Uh, tell us again about phase two. [SHAGGY AND SCOOBY GROANING] Hey, man. Like, we're here for the big Cleopatra party. Yeah, Cleopatra. [GROWLS] [MOANS] Thanks, man. [GROANING] Huh? [GROWLING] Whaa! [GROWLING] Well. Ha-ha-ha-ha. So much for Monsterpiece Theatre. [GROWLING] [SHAGGY WHISTLES] Phew. That was a close one. Like, what's up with the soggy seating arrangements? Hey, these are bags of cement. I wonder what they're doin' down here. [MOANING] Holy cow, Scoob. We made it. Now, all we've gotta do is sit tight and wait for Fred to give us the signal. Shaggy, look. Who dares disturb the tomb of the great Cleopatra. In the name of Isis, goddess of Egypt, be merciful to us. Oh, queen of the Nile. Yeah. What she said. [GROWLING] Ugh. [GRUNTS] Your greed has brought you far and through many dangers to look upon my golden beauty. Now you shall receive what you came for. [HISSES] No! It can't end like this for me. If you let me go, I-I-I promise, I'll stop treasure hunting forever. I'll open an orphanage. I'll save the rain forest. I'll recycle! It is too late for that now. Oh! It's too horrible, Scoob. I can't bare to watch it anymore. Me, neither. [MOANING] Freddy. Like, either Fred's taken up ancient aerobics or that's the signal. Hit it, Scoob. [♪♪♪] Scooby-Dooby-Doo! And, like, Shaggy too.

Oh, oh, we're goin' down! "Here lies Cleopatra, "last of the Pharaohs, protector of the lost riches of ancient Egypt!" A third Cleopatra. Let's hope three's a charm. [CACKLES] Amelia von Butch, you are unstoppable! [CHIMING] At last, the crown of Cleopatra is mine! [GROWLING] [GROWLS] [SCREAMS] DAPHNE: Jeepers. Leave this chamber, or be doomed forever! Yah! Zoinks! [♪♪♪] No! Whoa! Whoa! [GROWLS] [CACKLES] Hold on, gang! Keep paddlin', Scoob. She's right behind us. [CACKLES] Bear witness, mighty Sphinx. The crown is mine. Ah! No, my crown! [SCREECHES] Hup, hup, hup! [SNORTING] Ah! I wonder... Do Fred's plans always work so well? Let me down! I command you. The crown is rightfully mine. I am the sole survivor of Cleopatra's curse. Ah, you speak too quickly. The desert still holds many secrets. ALL: Whoa! [GASPS] Ah! [♪♪♪] It's Cleopatra. Look out! I don't know, Daph. She looks pretty washed up to me. [SNIFFING] Uh? [ALL GASP] ALL: Velma! Okay, Scooby, okay. OMAR: Velma! We did it, Velma. We did it. [DAPHNE GASPS] Prince Omar. He's okay! [SCREECHING] [GASPS] The golden crown of Cleopatra. It is in good hands now, my young prince. RIVERS: That was great! But c-could we do it again? I'd like to get it from another angle. FRED: It's Rock Rivers. He's okay too. Now, hold on. Is there really a curse or, like, not? I'm sure it's very easy to explain. Let's see. Okay, maybe it isn't. As soon as we discovered the hidden chamber, Omar knew that treasure hunters would come from all over. I hoped that if we could bring the curse to life, it would scare away the looters. OMAR: So Velma became Cleopatra. While my workers and I became her army of the undead. SHAGGY: Then, you used the quick-drying cement to make stone statues of yourselves. DAPHNE: Convincing us all that the curse had really come true. I did add a few extra touches of my own, like the swarm of locusts. I learned to breed them last year in science class. Who knew it would come in so handy? You guys put on an awesome scare. Maybe we could do a project together. We already have, Rock. After you offered to play along, we took your video camera and cataloged most of the tomb. Thanks to you, that footage is going to be seen around the world. Yeah, baby! I'm going global. The only thing we didn't count on was your surprise visit to the work site. But we could have helped you. Yeah, why didn't you let us in on the secret? VELMA: Like I said, I knew it would be dangerous, and I didn't want any of you to get hurt. I never imagined that you would lead an army of your own back to the tomb, just to rescue me. DAPHNE: Well, we have the citizens of the lost city to thank for that. [CHEERING] But it was really Shaggy and Scooby who were the bravest of all. They insisted on coming back for you, no matter what. Oh. You guys are the best friends ever. And now, Cleopatra's final wish has been granted. The riches of Egypt have been returned to her people. VON BUTCH: Yow! I won't stand for this. Give me my crown. My crown. [SOBBING] I want my crown. FRED: Well, that ought to hold it for another few thousand years. You should be proud, Velma. You helped restore one of the great monuments of the world. I just had a small part in the work. But you play a very large part in all of our lives. Yeah! [LAUGHS] Scooby. Like, check it out, gang. A firework fit for the Pharaohs. Are you sure that's a good idea, Shaggy? Sure. What could go wrong? [ALL GASP] [NOSE CRASHING] OMAR: You know, I think it looks better that way.
