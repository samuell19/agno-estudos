I'm sorry. Have a good evening. That's too bad. - Good night, Renos. - Good night. Don't mention that we met. Don't you worry about that. You've got the hiccups. Hiccups are a complicated process. It all starts with a sudden involuntary contraction of the respiratory muscles. It's a reflex triggered by certain stimuli. Maybe even emotional stress. Would you like a mint ? Are you always this calm ? I'm not sure if I am calm or if I just look calm. Don't you ever get scared ? I get scared. But fear disrupts the will. One profiterole.

It must be hard work, chopping a person into pieces. Takes a lot of effort. The tool needs to be sharp. Really well honed. Did you strangle him or stab him first ? Did you take off his clothes ? Or did you start by cutting through the fabric ? The best thing is to drain all the blood from the body making horizontal cuts along the major arteries. The smell is intense. Did you use a saw ? When underwater, a corpse fills with air. Rises to the surface and floats. To keep it under takes three times its weight. Will it be just you ? Yes, Renos. Just me. A vodka orange. Heavy on the vodka this time. Right away. What's up ? Changed your uniform ? A turtleneck, not a shirt ? How come ? We wore turtlenecks at school. To hide love bites left by girls. POLICE STATION I wanted to check you're alright. I'm alright. You ? Come in. Can I take your jacket ? Would you like something to drink ? - Yes. - Beer ? Renos, I think I'll be leaving soon. I can't stay here anymore after all that's happened. But I want to see you again. Me too. I want to see you again. But I never expect anything from anyone, Gina. You said my name. For the first time. Oranges are better when they're bitter. So fragrant... In the morning we cross the border. Excuse me, where's the toilet ? Outside, on the right. My name is Irineos Kaldis. I live at number 7 Eastern Rumelia Street. Buoyancy... An upward force exerted by a fluid against the weight of an immersed body. When underwater, a corpse fills with air. Rises to the surface and floats. To keep it under takes three times its weight. THE WAITER Subtitles from Register
