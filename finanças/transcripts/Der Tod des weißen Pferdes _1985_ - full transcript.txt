THE DEATH OF THE WHITE STALLION A film by Christian Ziewer for Lukas Piper Hans, said the virgin Mary tome “go to Niklashausen and preach to the people.” And so, brothers and sisters, hear my words. Germany in the 16th century. A village is sold. “I, Caspar von Schenkenstein, knight, do hereby attest that I have sold the village of Ostheim to the monastery at Auhausen under the venerable Abbot Georg... with all rights, tithes and taxes “For yourselves and your heirs, you vow to pay your yearly tax, to do your work promptly and to be obedient in your deeds as in your hearts. This you vow and promise to your new lord, Abbot Georg, Before God the Almighty.” I do swear. I do swear. I swear. I swear. We're still under the same heaven. Nothing has changed. And the bishop sent his horsemen They fell upon the Christians and burned Piper Hans at the stake. The clerics and the monks adorn themselves with riches and live in luxury. They pay no duty and no taxes. Verily I say unto you: There will come a time when the rich lords and the clergy will have to work for a day’s wages. And they burned Piper Hans at the stake. A merchant needs wool. The value of painting for business. The proportions, the colors, the robe... Unsurpassable! The majesty of our Lord: With the finest brush strokes for the pious eye ... And observe the expression of the saints, their reverent gestures. Such emotion! And the lamb which rids us of our sins. In addition, the Master will paint the back just as you wished... If your lordship would perhaps... These two want a contract. A contract? They need but sign and they work for you. Fine, but quickly. Tempus fugit! They don’t look especially pleased. That will soon change... After we've signed.... Master weavers Jakob Wetter and Jakob Drummer. Strauss explained everything to you? Yes. Everything. Then take the wool and deliver the cloth punctually. Now don't be lazy. Do you have your calculation? Give it here Your lordship, the Master says: The altar will be even greater, More splendid, the colors more glowing... But a Coronation of the Virgin? I told the Master I need an Epiphany in the middle. Unfortunately, he didn’t have one, your lordship. What am I do do with a Coronation of the Virgin when I want an Epiphany? But what an opportunity! The Master asks but 80 florins for the panel. 80 florins... who’s this? Who was this altar meant for? That I dare not say. He couldn’t pay, and since he is councillor in his town, I must hold my tongue. I only hope that no one will notice that the altar was not painted specially for me. But, your lordship! Look: Here the Master will paint over your likeness... here that of your wife, and here your three children ... And this we’ll remove. Lengthen the gown to please the eye. Fine. Tell the Master I'll sleep on it ... Fare thee well! Now ... Your lordship? What do our books say? Your lordship: We lack 40 hundredweight until the next shearing, and your lordship cannot take on any more weavers. 40 hundredweight? 40 hundredweight. Then we'll have to see that we get them. And this will help us. Write, so that we’ll always have enough wool on hand “To my dear brother...” “To our dear brother, Reverend Georg, Abbot of Sancti Benedicti monastery at Auhausen ...” Your sheep in our pastures, and you at our tables. You know where you are? Keep quiet, peasant. We'll not have your sheep eating our grass. Everything now belongs to the monastery. Go tell your monk: Peasant land holds nothing for him. Praised be the Lord. I am here so that you can repent. Praised be the Lord. Forever after, amen. Amen. I am Father Andreas. That's not wool but straw, Reverend Father. And in those sacks? Also straw. No wool? ... Perhaps somewhere in the barn... or the stable? All sold at market. Then the bishop came with his horsemen And fell upon the devout people. They burned Piper Hans at the stake. Then Piper Hans ascended to Heaven. Yes, son, and they put out my eyes and those of many others as well. What nonsense. You were never in Niklashausen. They put out my eyes. You got that for stealing fish from the stream. Still, I was with Piper Hans and heard every word he said ... That there shall be justice And that no one shall be superior to another. So shut up! Why, this is vinegar, you bastard! And this! How much salt is in here? A pest on you all! Don’t you like it either? What have your peasants done to them? What's that to me? Ruined the food? Why must we poor feed a monk? I didn’t kill the dog. Sit down Your soup isn’t oversalted. The poor have nothing to throw away. Is that justice? The monks should go to the peasants who have sheep. I have none. You've a loose tongue. And what’s this? Wool which I wash for one of the peasants. It belongs to him. And all that as well. Woman! When there the Brothers are abused, you're all responsible, the village. Shame on you and be still! Thanks be to the Lord, for He is good. His Word lights our path. Thanks be to the Lord, for He is good. We are baptized to one Body. Thanks be to the Lord, for He is good. He works in us through His Spirit. Thanks be to the Lord, for He is good. Go back, women. There will be no service or mass today. Abbot Georg instructed me to keep this holy place shut until you have done penance ... you and your husbands. Forgive me, Reverend Father. Let me in to the altar. God is everywhere. You can do penance anywhere. I must pray to the Blessed Mother Anna. But not in the chapel! If you've something to confess, do it at confessional, not here. Now back to the village. Forgive me Reverend Father! You've let the Devil into your hearts! Tell your men: This arrogance is at an end! Help me, Blessed Mother Anna. Stand by me in my hour of need and give me another child. Don’t punish me for what the peasants did. They’ll never do it again. Blessed Mother Anna, the others shouldn’t point at me Give me a child. So that they can better believe it ... So that they can better believe it ... That’s just right. For they’ll only believe what they can see and touch. “... that the meadows and pastures used by the community shall be for the use of the feudal lord as well. Furthermore, we declare that we shall hand over the wool of all sheep held on the land granted us to our feudal lord. Dated Sunday, Judica, etc., etc. Lukas Feuerbacher.” That’s impossible, your holiness. Is this a document or isn't it? I've never seen it. But your father did. Or is that not his signature? Father couldn’t have .. We would know. Why not ask him? He died long ago. The Lord have mercy on his soul. At any rate, there is an order to everything. Now go and tell the others, and don't worry. As God is my witness, no peasant in Ostheim has ever seen this document. Villages and towns perish. The earth grows barren From the coldest cold and most devastating heat. Then the Emperor shall return. Heaven opens and the white stallion comes forth. The Emperor sits upon the white stallion and passes judgement. He strangles the officials and prelates, the usurers and monks. They try to flee, but he strikes them all dead. The Reverend wants your land and your wool as well. And he has a document? My lord, the wool is ours just like the sheep. You upheld that when you were still our lord. Very strange that the Reverend should pick such a quarrel. And it's signed by Feuerbacher the Elder? But not in accordance with convention and law. Watch your mouth, Feuerbacher. I don’t want any trouble with the monastery because you fail to deliver! What we owe we'll give. But of course! You'll give this but not that. And later, you'll give that but not this. I had the same trouble with you myself. But don’t worry. We’'ll make sure you don't leave the pathway to Heaven You’ve never heard of the document either. Listen, peasant: I'm no longer your lord. I'm now the magistrate of Truhendingen. It cost me a lot to become that, and I'll see to it that I remain that. I've no time for your quarrel. But Abbot Georg should abide as you once did. That’s all we want. So you want to make demands. Not obey but demand. You'll learn the hard way. But you also knew our rights and respected them in your day. You filthy peasant! You trying to teach me? To teach me? No. What did you say? No, lord. Now clear out, before I set the dogs on you! He strangles the officials and prelates, the usurers and monks. They try to flee, but he strikes them all dead. And the white stallion wades in their blood. What once was, is no longer valid. Time of transition. What once was, is no longer valid. Time of transition. That'll cost an eye ... If you don't want to lose it, you’d best wait until dark. No one will see you. Bartel, back from the Wars, thinks everyone’s a thief like his father. I've no need to hide these, you hireling. Gave Anna a round belly. It's not round yet, but there’s something there. We soldiers have to live like nuns in a monastery! I take a peasant’s last cow. He falls to his knees: “Dear lord, not my cow! Every Sunday a nun comes to bathe in the milk” So I took the cow and the next Sunday the nun as well. A soldier and a pig like jelly always want to gorge their bellies I'll get me a servant ... and yet another cow! But before you do, give me two pence. I must buy the priest a large candle. The child is my work, not his. I promised the Blessed Mother Anna a large candle. I've no money for your priest. Vows must be kept! We'll soon find ourselves a new one. A candle for every child? That'll make you poor. One like at the town church. And he’ll have to preach out against the monks. The Brothers fill their stomachs, and you go begging! Two pence! Before we go begging... - What kind of a sour wine did they give you? Needs more honey. Before we go begging, Feuerbacher can go begging! With so much land? And three horses? They won’t help him now! And forty sheep? No need to look away, Frau Feuerbacher. Kilian Feuerbacher’s father signed the document. He got us into this mess. I want two pence! Give them to me! My money’s not for that sin- hunter! Veit Gall? Yes? In the name of the Reverend, Abbot Georg, you're to come along. Why? For stealing fish. On your feet! I've stolen nothing ... What’s that: come! No! Don’t take him! He’s done no wrong. Shall I run you through? Tell your abbot: Satan fetched Veit Gall. The hired soldiers shouldn’t set us against the monastery. And you took part. You want to hand Veit over, accept the injustice? What injustice? The Reverend Georg just wants to hear him out. We don't let the wolf into our stable. The Reverend Georg is our lord. And if he wants to hear a peasant out, the peasant goes to him, not the other way around. But when the lord misuses his rights? First he took our pastures, then the wool, and now Veit’s a fish thief? Finkenwirt, you're a fool. Seek peace, respect the staff. He who says that the freeing of Veit Gall was unjust, step to this side. You want to judge yet you don’t give the peasant his rights. He fetched a fish because I'm with child. Every woman got fish in the past. For each child that's underway. That’s to change now? Is that just? And is it unjust for a peasant to provide for his wife? He who says that the freeing of Veit Gall was unjust, step to this side. Are there many who don’t want to bite the fox? Yes, old man. There are many. He who says that the freeing of Veit Gall was just ... I've little to say to you. You've a quarrel with the monastery because of your wool and pastures. The Abbot has a document laying claim to both. You say you've never seen the document before. I wrote the document. It is a forgery. May the Lord forgive me. It is not Gods will to cheat the peasants. Forgive me, brethren. You wrote the document ... and signed for Lukas Feuerbacher? The Reverend wanted it so. It was all a lie! He who says that the freeing of Veit Gall was just, step over here! The bird doth hop with crooked gait about the outspread net so fine, until it slowly seals his fate and tightens around his head and spine. An oath is holy, and justice is his who has paper and seal. Where is the document? Tell us, Brother Thomas, to rid us of our guilt. If you don't, I'll burn your house of God to the ground. My sons, I swear upon my soul I shit upon your soul. The forged document! It's not here. Abbot Georg sent it to the magistrate. You liars and cheats! You always get away with everything! You rabble! Bloodsuckers! Slave drivers! My sons! There, behold the Savior and take heed! Our God Your God. That’s your God! You buried him there and beat him to death with those! - You want to kill us all! I'll shove your documents down your throat! A plague upon you! You want to kill us! Kill us, you goddamned lot! You wolves! They cheated us. Everything out. Clear out everything! No, not the altar! I said everything. Don't, I beg of you! “To the gracious Lord ... at Onolzbach.” “To the gracious Lord at Onolzbach.” “To our gracious Lord at Onolzbach.” “To our most gracious Lord.” Wait. “To our most gracious Prince.” Write: “To our most gracious Prince.” “... by the Grace of God.” Yes, Reverend Father, that’s good. “To our most gracious Prince at Onolzbach by the Grace of God.! Have at them! Attack! Damn landlord! Down from the horse! Go right back to your village, or the Prince will reduce your homes to ashes. Knight von Schenkenstein. You, too, Feuerbacher? Dismount ... lord. So we can tell you what we want. Back to your village, now, you rabid dogs! We want our rights. Who put that in your ear? That’s nothing to spit upon! The Prince will hang you for that! I've said how it is. Climb down before something worse happens. “I, Caspar von Schenkenstein, do hereby swear: I shall not escape nor abandon the peasants of Ostheim Until the forged document is in their hands. I shall do my utmost to see that justice triumphs.” Do you swear that before God, our Lord? I swear. Time stands still. A glimpse into the future. This is wool! Monastery wool! Holy wool! The monks send their sheep onto our land, and what's the result? Their wool ends up in our barns. We'll divide up their sheep, says Feuerbacher. The stable is much too small. I'll build a bigger one! And I know how .... from this Here. Hide this in the house. What’s that? It’s stolen property. I'll have no plunder in our house! The monks won't miss it. It's consecrated, and you steal it. You'll bring us misfortune. If you don’t do it... Not into this house! When will you remove the chalice? When we have the damn document. The prince knows our cause is just. And what you did at the monastery? That’s the penalty for what the monastery did. Have no fear, Anna. He wants things to change. You must have a banner. From the chapel. Then everything will be fine. Later, Anna. First the wool and now the sheep. Everything’s just for you. Want to be lords here as well, you thieving riff-raff? Chatters like an old magpie! You've certainly cooked something up! You can have some grain. See what’s left.... and you can drink your fill of wine, too Am I a beggar you fob off with the leftovers of the feast? Back to the village with you! I want sheep, just like the peasants. You're washerwoman, nothing but a maid. If it doesn’t suit you, become a peasant. Reverend Father, you look like a good Christian. Then defend my rights against this pack of thieves! You should be driven off! First stop grumbling and cursing. Christ told us to be loving and humble. That’s right. The peasants get their sheep, their document and more. And what’s left for us poor? A tankard of wine! And war with the Abbot and the Prince! That’s what so much love and humility gets us. Has anyone ever held a peasant and a washerwoman to be equal? You're stupider than a piece of wood. You can only piss on the fields of others. I want my sheep. When I sat at the table of blind Behaimhans, the Lord had led me to him, one of the poor. He wanted to remind me that He is just. The justice of God ... that's why we’re here. In the Acts of the Apostles it is written: “Each received what he needed.” And if you give the woman a few sheep, you fulfill God’s justice. You shall be the first in His eyes. But how, Reverend Father? Reverend Father, you should be our priest. Then our village would soon be a heavenly Jerusalem. That’s pure gold, my son, when we sell the fish at the marketplace. But we're not taking them to market, grandfather. We’ll cook them ourselves, and everyone can eat his fill. And there’s surely some good wine left in the mastery cellar. She came that morn in a snow- white gown, her hair shorn, for a nunnery bound. Away the count did wrest, tears rained upon his cheek. The heart within his breast broke in a thousand piece. Must I remind you of your VOWS? The vows of obedience? Then I'd rather go to Purgatory than roast in Hell forever. They’ve nothing on when they get to Heaven? But the angels aren’t naked. When our soul stands before the Lord, it is free of all earthly burdens. Thus we should not cling to lovely clothes, riches and possessions. We must leave all behind. We’ve only ourselves on Judgement Day. Judgement Day. Grandfather said he’ll see again on Judgement Day. He'll get his eyes back that they put out. Before the Lord we lose all blindness I'm glad we'll all see again. Grandfather’s been blind for so long. A new day. Where are you, God? What do they want here? My God! Run! That awaits you all when we catch you! “Our dear brethren of Opfenried. Strength and comfort in Christ. We have heard of your love of justice. Surely you will send your brotherly support to the monastery at Auhausen. For we want to defend ourselves, until our gracious Lord and Prince secures our God-given rights.” Didn't I give you my word? Yet you spread the revolt. Write: “From the people of Ostheim.” You rob and destroy. And what do you paint on your banner? A fish and a lamb The Church has grown rich. Christ’s disciples have become merchants, usurers and swindlers. Instead of loving their neighbour, they mistreat the people and sit upon God's throne. But the peasant no longer wants to be sacrificed. He must obey. Just check your Breviary: “He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.” You've lived by it your fair share. It is a knight’s duty to defend order. But it must be just! And if not, it should become so. The world’s a manure heap, since Adam ate from the apple. That's why the sword will always be red with blood ... until Doomsday. And we're to sit by and watch? Is that our purpose on earth? Knight, have you never wondered what God plans for you? That's up to Him alone! He'll surely know. Man is but filth and shit, worse than an animal. The falcon hunts only when hungry. But is this hunger? Now they’re squatting out there as if their 'brotherhood' could push open the gates of Eden. But when the new day dawns, self interest will again call the tune. The people must be free if God’s justice is to come to pass. How they yelled when they were to give the woman a few sheep.... But they finally decided to. In the end, the one will skin the other. Today 'Hosanna', tomorrow... That’s not so! You know that it is. You despise the people. I see them as they are... Ask them what their God looks like. A pitiful being that they call upon when they have trouble farting. How can they be allowed to take the law into their own hands? Mountains would crumble, water would flow upwards! But that won’t happen. I'll tell you what will: They’'ll quickly lose their appetite for your war. They want to live. Nothing but live. They'll curse their false brotherhood. and what will remain is our order. The Prince will kill you all. No one knows if the Prince sent the riders... maybe they were bandits. Will things be better when we've our little babe? Of course ... just as the crops don't freeze every year. If we don't get the sheep back, I'll set fire to the monastery. What are you doing? Setting fire ... everywhere. Everything should burn. Mother said so, too. You'll not burn a thing. I will, lord! I'm no lord. You should call me 'Brother Andreas.' You're a lord, just like the ones who took the sheep! Everything here shall burn. And I'll laugh, I and the others: Mother, grandfather and Bartel. We'll all laugh. I forbid you to talk like that. You've nothing to say! You're nothing but a damn monk. You must be done away with. Burn! Put out his eyes! Do you, too, want thievery and violence? Yes! I want you dead. Dead, dead, dead! What language! The Lord God gave us strength and ... I'll kill him, too! I'll kill all of you! You all must die! You damn peasant rogue! You dare to ... you must roast in Hell! The Devil will tear and bite you! You're to blame for everything, you damn monk! Take that and that and that! Have you ever carried a banner in battle? The standard-bearer is the most important man of all. Without a banner victory is impossible. So hold it high. Whatever happens, you can’t surrender it. Hold it in during close combat. Tight. Don't let it flutter. What's wrong, Veit? If You are a just God, help us. But if You are not a just God, The weight shall rest upon You for all eternity. The Emperor passes judgement. He strangles them all. The Emperor passes judgement. He strangles them all... We don’t belong here. Our place is in our chapel. There we must pray. Sword and ashes. Cursed landlord. Is that how you keep your word? Get back! He’s not to be slaughtered like a pig. Reverend Father, Reverend Father... Come here, Hans! Reverend Father! Don’t cry. We'll meet again someday. I'll burn in Hell. No, Hans. Because I struck you, lord. You shouldn't call me 'lord'. Yes, lord. You're not going to Hell. Definitely not. Arise Jesus! Stand by us! Drive the poison from the earth! Christ against Satan! Earth give fruit! Milk and honey flow from the rocks! Christ against Satan! The sun grows dark and the stars fall down like leaves.
