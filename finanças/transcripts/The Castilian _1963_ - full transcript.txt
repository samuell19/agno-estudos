A handful of small nations living in hatred and envy and sporadically at war with each other. Closest of all Europe to the coast of Africa they became the doormat for the early Moorish invasions. The Moors, most ferocious and most powerful fighters of the world at that time, swept over Spain like an engulfing tide and by rape and slaughter struck fear into all Europe. Only the tiny Christian kingdoms of Leon and Navarre provided resistance against further northern penetration. These kingdoms, united temporarily by the marriage of the sister of King Sancho of Navarre to the King of Leon, maintained an uneasy peace. But it always lay like a powder keg, awaiting only the fuse to blow it up. [SCREAMING] [ALL YELLING] [MEN LAUGHING] Oh, no! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHING] [***] NARRATOR: The tiny province of Castile bore the brunt of these many years of bloodshed, intrigue and plunder. Governor of Castile was Diego Gonzalez, the Count of Lara. He ruled by paying tribute to the Moors in gold and human lives and by being a subject to Leon. His younger brother, Fernan Gonzales, unable to tolerate these conditions, left the court. His beliefs, well known to his people, were that men should fight and die rather than live without freedom. A feeling new to this age of oppression. And so, hidden away to avert civil war, he lived with his friend, the peasant Jeronimo in the mountains of Oca. And since this story is true, I, Jerifan, will tell all of it to you. Did you see that, Jeronimo? An axe can be a good friend. An axe is for peasants! Sword or axe, what counts is the result. Oh, what's wrong with you? Huh! What's wrong with me? It's the same story. Doesn't it ever trouble you, living like this? Hidden away from God and man! God knows where to find me. Yeah. You've been in these woods far too long for a Castilian. Three years! Now things are even worse in Castile. Leon on one side, Navarre on the other, and the Moors on the south. That always happens when a border country becomes weak. This tree is my symbol. Even with the branches divided and stretching out to the sky, it's strong because it's joined together. Each part stronger because it's welded into a single unit. This is my belief, one man to unite the land against the Moorish barbarians, put an end to their invasions and make one Christian kingdom. But feeling this way, I cannot go back! Make more trouble for my people! Nor can I bow my head, say yes when the answer is no! Be a servant to the court of Leon. No, Castile is in chains. Here, I'm free to forget. Your brother will die one day. Then the Castilians will do whatever is right. They'll call you. Will they? We of Castile do not inherit the leadership. I can only win it with the strength of my arm. You will win, Fernando. The wind's from the west. That means plenty of game on the other side of the mountain You see, you trap different animals different ways. It's the same with men. Of course I'm not as clever as you are, but you have to use your head. Heh. Even if it's only to cover it with a squirrel cap. [BOTH CHUCKLING] [HORSES NEIGHING] [***] The insignia of Navarre. The banners of the family of King Sancho. Get down. Hide. They mustn't see us. Let them. Come back! They'll kill you! Halt. [***] MAN: Hm. What have we here? Hunters? On the scent of sparrows? Ha, ha. Castilians on the scent of rats. Rats are we? Well, you wanna learn, don't you? Well, let's see how brave you are. Hold, cavaliers. In God's name, you don't know who you are attacking. Be quiet! I command you. So the Castilians are brave, are they? MAN: They don't look so brave to me. [ALL LAUGHING] Let's see what color Castilian blood is! WOMAN: Hold! The Infanta of Navarre commands you. Help me down. Excuse my cavaliers. They are warriors, not courtiers. [***] Senora, let us continue on our way. The road is long and your aunt Queen Teresa will be impatient. Must we spend another night in Castile? How far to Leon's frontier? The rate of a bell's toll, two leagues. The road is bad, Senora. In a moment darkness will descend upon us. We must find shelter. You. Do you know of a place? Well, the town of Lara isn't far. But you'll find no welcome there for Navarrese. Pay no attention, Senora. He speaks that way only because the Lords of Lara now rule Castile. Only Rodrigo. The other one is still waiting. Who is the other? Fernan Gonzalez. I would rather spend the night here. Captain, have our tents prepared. [***] JERIFAN: * A love was born * * When their eyes First met * * A love so warm * * That they could Not forget * * Inside awoke * * A dream too long asleep * * A dream that now was theirs to keep * * Her gentle voice * * Spoke and it began * * And soon it echoed * * Far across the land * * From both their hearts * * A lonely part was torn * * That moment when * * A love was born * * This was their destiny * * Fate had said * * This would be * * And so it is * * And will always be * * A love that lives * * Through all eternity * * A flame that now * * And will forever show * * That tender moment * * Love was born * I prefer that roof too. There's no room for pride under the sky. I'd like to hold all those stars in this hand. You talk like a minstrel. No, like a king. Heh. I am a king. King of the woods. King of deer. Captain of the hawks. Emperor of the owls. There. Oh. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [***] FERNAN: It's just like a... A new born river. Someone said that life is like a river flowing to the sea. The end death. Too morbid. Another said, "Rivers are like lovers when they meet." They become inseparable. With space for drowning between your side of the river and mine. No drowning, I swear. [DOGS BARKING] [BOTH PANTING] [BARKING] Save us, senora, we are free of guilt. [WHIMPERS] Senor, you know me. I am Peribanez. Infanzon of Medina. She and I are in love. But the law steals her from my side to deliver her to Covarrubias. The tribute of a hundred maidens. Each year one hundred Castilian maidens are given to the Moors. A coward's peace. Peace at that price is too expensive. SOLDIER: There she is. Halt, Castilians. That woman is now protected by the church. You must not stand in the way of Castilian law. SOLDIER: Unleash the dogs. What is going on here, senora? These hunters were tracing the heron and they've lost it. Senora, the king, your father, ordered me to guard your safe return to Navarre. Forgive me for having slept, though it does not excuse your absence. Withdraw, Castilians. It's dawn. A bad time to go hunting. Come with me to the next village. You'll be safe there. Should we never see each other again? We will, senora. If Navarre does not come to me, I will come to Navarre. Come. Thank you so much. [***] A beautiful woman is more powerful than a herd of horses. Brothers, God has taken our leader up unto Himself into heaven. So, now, let us all pray for Fernan Gonzales our beloved new Count. Wherever he may be. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [***] [ALL CHATTERING] [TOLLS] SOLDIER: I expected no welcome from these people. I was told that they were savages. I would not swear they do not bite. Heh. Give me some coins, Dona Guiomar. FERNAN: Are those Castilians? They've lost their minds or they have been tamed by that miracle maker, Friar Servando. What has happened to our Castilians? Why should there be such a greeting? They hate Navarre and they did not expect me. MAN: Who needs Navarrese coins? [MAN CHUCKLES] MAN: Don't touch them, they are Navarrese. Keep your coins. Go back to Navarre. WOMAN: Look at her. Does she think we wanna see her? MAN: No more tributes! Look, the insignia of Castile. MAN: Get out before we throw you out. Thank God you have come back, senor. I've traveled all Castile preaching. Everywhere they swear loyalty to their new lord. The new lord? Your brother, Don Rodrigo is dead. His last words were, "Fernando was right. God be with you." Senor, I just arrived from Burgos. Counts, princes, clergymen all are fighting for the leadership left vacant by the death of your brother. You must go there too. God is on your side. Lara's leader must be Castile's leader. Long live the Count of Lara! [ALL CHEERING] You need fear nothing, senor. The church will protect this one. Long live Fernan Gonzales. Long live the new judge of Castile. The charcoal-er judge and governor of Castile! Fernan Gonzales. At your service, Infanta Navarre. If I become the Count of Castile there are two things I must do. Defeat the Moor and go to Navarre to see you. I will see you but only after you have put an end to the tribute of the hundred maidens. Agreed. When shall we meet again? Give me a time. There is no date, but the king's will. For myself I await the Count of Castile. Fernan Gonzales! Senor. Senor? Why not say friend? We were looking for you in the mountains. At Burgos is the body of Castile and you must be the head. We must win over those who oppose your election. We will, Inigo. We will, Gustios, but we must go to Covarrubias first. The Moors are waiting. [***] [ALL CHEERING] Hmm. Are you crying, senora? Yes, Dona Guiomar, I am. [CACKLING] [ALL LAUGHING] [***] MAN: Look at this one. Ah, they look better than last year's. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MEN LAUGHING] [CACKLES] Here I come, maidens! [ALL YELLING] [ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [ALL CHUCKLE AND CHEER] [ALL YELLING] [***] FERNAN: The trick worked, Jeronimo. Yes, Fernando, but only because we caught them with other things on their minds. Light bonfires and bury the dead. Ha, ha. I'll keep it as a remembrance. Let their flag fly all night. Not to forget that a single victory will not win a war. This is a difficult time for Castile. Leon rules us, Navarre wants to attack us. Abderraman and his Moors are preparing to invade Castile before spring. And all we do is talk and discuss. Words, words! It is important that we find the right man to rule Castile and soon. Even though Lara has been ruling Castile for years, this gives no rights to you or Fernan Gonzales. MAN: Fernan Gonzales has no hereditary rights. I am trying to find the best. And he... [PEOPLE MURMURING] MAN 1: Fernan Gonzales. MAN 2: How did he get here? Welcome, Count of Lara. Thank you, Don Nuno. Excuse my delay. You see there were a few things that detained me. In the woods? In Covarrubias. Wasn't it in Covarrubias where Castile had to deliver one hundred of its most beautiful maidens to the Moors? Well, I complied with your orders, however, I made a slight change. I collected one hundred maidens for Castile. [ALL CHATTERING] I knew you would not want me empty handed. Endangering our very lives. [MAN YELLS] MAN: Making a stupid blunder. This is the problem, cavaliers. You've never dared to make such blunders. What have you ever done for Castile? Nothing. No resistance. Only obey the Moor's demands. I have cauterized the wound with fire. I am not here to beg or try to convince you. Neither Castile nor I needs you. I came to let you decide. Castile needs a fighter. You! A free man able to free Castile. JERONIMO: Fernan Gonzales! [ALL MURMURING] Fernan Gonzalez! Here is our man. Do you still doubt it? Fernan Gonzales! Fernan Gonzales! A real fighter! Fernan Gonzalez! MAN: Fernan Gonzalez! Fernan Gonzales. Judge and governor of Castile. This is the sword of Nuno Rasura, first Castilian judge. A sword to be stained only with the blood of honor. We of Burgos present it to you. Use it well against our enemies. Honor it, Fernan Gonzales, as did your family. I accept the sword and all it means. But you men of Castile must accept my command. No conditions. That does not mean I will not listen. I can use good advice. I propose this. A message to the kingdom of Leon. Their laws will no longer be obeyed by Castilians. A message to Navarre. Drop hostilities. Our only desire is solid friendship. And a message to the Moors in Cordoba. No more tributes. No more maidens. Renegades are many, we are few. And badly armed. If we provoke Abderraman, Castile will perish. They'll kill us all. [ALL CHATTERING] There is only the one way. Abderraman must be defeated! If we must lose then this will be our death, Castilians. Nobody will stand in our way. [***] INIGO: The Moors are not very hospitable. There is no welcome for us. They even bolt the doors of your castle, Nuno. [ALL SNORING] [GRUNTS] [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] [ALL GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [***] Look. Look down there. [ALL CHEERING] [ALL CHUCKLING] [***] [ALL GRUNTING] [BOTH GROAN] [ALL GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] The Moors love the sights of Castile, ha, ha. [LAUGHING] [***] FERNAN: Take the horses. Thank you, Maria. And the others. In this war we must all fight as we can. Come. We have more work to do. [LAUGHING] [***] Senor, the tribute of the 100 maidens has been broken in Castile. That sounds like a challenge. The Castilians have a bad leader. Who is it? Fernan Gonzales. A young man. And too inexperienced. Senor... What are you hesitating about? He has ambushed and killed over a 1000 of our soldiers. He attacks at night and runs. Like a cowardly dog. And Bongourago has been captured. Our biggest fortress! How? Under a huge black smoke covering the Castilians attacked unseen. [***] Sir, your castle is guarded by the bishop and the knight. The young Count of Castile thinks he can fight me at night? Well, we, too, know how to fight, night or day. I will deal with him in my way. He will regret his actions. But not until spring. I will go to Castile when the roses bloom. Leon will come next. And Navarre! And France! You frighten me, Senor. The worst we can get is death. [CHUCKLES] The best, seven kingdoms. Move. It is said there is no water in Castile. It is like a desert. We will make a garden out of it. Move. [LAUGHING] JERIFAN: And now Fernan Gonzalez arranged to see the King of Leon, legal ruler of Castile. But he didn't know that Sancha, Infanta of Navarre, was still there visiting her aunt. Nor did she believe she would ever see him again. You cannot allow your subject to take you for a weakling, and let the Count of Castile ignore you. He has broken the tribute of the 100 maidens, has declared war on the Moors and is endangering the Christian kingdoms. To put an end to that shameful tribute was a just decision. But he acted without asking your advice. I know he will not stop until he destroys us. Our kingdom Leon! [CLICKS TONGUE] Nonsense. He can't cause me any problems. Besides it is better to be tolerant with a foe as determined as the count. Your father killed the six best cavaliers in Castile. My father was weak. Weak people use violence because they lack authority. Do not worry too much, my dear. I have called Count Fernan Gonzalez here in order to find out his intentions. SANCHA: Ooh. [PLAYING] [***] [KING OF LEON LAUGHING] I would be naive not to know what you wish, senor. But you cannot come to Leon to seek personal favors. FERNAN: But how can we go on living under ancient laws. Laws brought to Spain and then forced on us by you. We wish to be governed by our own laws. In our council you may say anything you please. But remember, people like to hold onto their traditions. I know. I face the same problems. Whenever I want to change anything they make it as difficult as moving those mountains. FERNAN: I would rather stop being a king if I had no authority. In Castile, I command. That is because they need you. I am not that necessary in my kingdom. They disregard the south. They consider themselves too safe. The only thing they're interested in is Navarre's friendship. After all, that is where I found my wife. But the Moor is another thing, the real danger. They will not stop until our provinces are conquered. Abderraman has a powerful army. He will attack us first. And if we go down, no one will survive. Neither Navarre nor Leon. I propose a triple alliance. Against that Abderraman would never dare start a war. State your price. The independence of Castile. I cannot afford that. Then I must fight for it. Ooh. [CHUCKLES] KING OF LEON: My niece, the Infanta of Navarra. Fernan Gonzalez, Count of Castile. [***] I am convinced. But what about Navarre? How can you convince them? By means of a marriage. Does that surprise you, senor? FERNAN: Say, cavalier, thou who through all wars have lived whether thy horse, thy spur and that star have such beauty? [***] No, neither the spur, nor the war, nor the star is as beautiful as you are. [CHUCKLES] This is a different sky. If you closed your hand you would hold embattlements instead of stars. Does this not depress you, senora? In Leon even the sky is fortified. Count of Castile. The Count of Castile is closer to you than a charcoaler. Maybe further apart. No, listen. My first official action was... Was to erase an offense against women and love. I know. The second. Take this message with you. Tell your father, King Don Sancho, I want peace. War will only be against the Southern pagan. Add this to your message. The day Fernan Gonzalez becomes rich and powerful, that day he will go to Navarre to claim their princess. [IN MIND] "You must know, my dear brother, that the intention of Fernan Gonzalez is to widen his frontier into Leon and your kingdom. The Count is skillful and has inclined your daughter Sancha to him. Do not let him deceive you with reasons of love which only hide his ambitions in politics. Teresa." I'll show the Count of Castile what it means to be ambitious! My son, you'll be king during my absence. Father! Fernan Gonzalez has done nothing against us. Quiet! A king's decision is final. You may be fooled, but we know his motive. JERIFAN: King Sancho of Navarre invaded Castile, first at Curiela, and took over the castle of Don Gonzalo to await the reaction of Fernan Gonzalez. Count Fernan had a very deep sorrow. He rode alone in the shadow. He went to the cold mountain, the mountain where autumn never ends. [***] JERIFAN: Under the frozen stars, under the moon he walked. There was love on one side, Castile was on the other. [***] Three times he offered peace, three times he was rejected. They call me Sancho the Drunkard. Because they say that Bacchus the God of Wine rules Navarre and that's a lie! If I didn't drink how could I be magister angelicus of wine? Whatever that means. It means that you are a master of the science of wines, but not the wisdom of its use. Oh, you speak well, Monsignor. My cousin, the Count of Toulouse, thinks that French wines are better than Spanish wines. But this wine is for peace. It dissolves the blood, isn't that right, Don Gonzalo? [LAUGHING] It depends upon the heart of the person who is drinking the wine. Oh, heh, that's a funny remark for a tavern keeper. You've been a perfect host. Now I'll be a perfect guest. I'm gonna take all of your wines back to Navarre with me. [LAUGHING] Sire. Messengers have arrived from Castile. They bring news from Count Fernan Gonzalez. Let them come right in here. [SANCHO CHUCKLES] Welcome. We thank you, King Sancho, for your welcome. However, we expect a more proper welcome from Gonzalo Diaz, governor of this castle. [LAUGHING] Welcome, my friends. Although the occasion is rather unfortunate. Is impertinence a virtue with you Castilians? On the contrary, sir. We mean to be sincere and honest. On all sides we are threatened. We are the smallest corner of Spain, yet you treat us like a dangerous viper! One day we must revolt. Yet Castile wants peace. Three times my lord requested peace, three times he was rejected. You have sacked our villages and hamlets, therefore Fernan Gonzalez, Count, Judge and Governor of Castile challenges you. Challenges me? [CHUCKLES] No, ha-ha-ha! Tell the count his madness amazes me. Four miserable victories in four miserable hamlets. He's lost his mind. Now he wants to lose his head. I'll take care of that, too. Now you get out of here. Go on, get out! Tell the count I'm on my way. This will give him time to crawl back into his rat hole. Fernan Gonzalez is in no hurry, Sire. On the contrary, he'll be waiting for you in Valpierre. At your convenience. At my convenience? Alright, tell him I'll be there. [***] I think we should set a trap. No. He's insulted me enough. No ambush, no hiding. We fight his way. Out in the open. But we're 40 horsemen against 300. Every Castilian has two arms. A weapon in each hand. If we charge bravely we double our strength. There's no big difference. The king is mine, the victory is yours. Mine is a personal affair, but you fight for Castile. Don't endanger the victory for my sake. [IN MIND] Since I know you and because I love you, I lost you and I lost myself, [***] I lost you because a strange abyss that increases in depth every day is between us. I lost myself because I belong to you and this makes me the most unfortunate prisoner on earth. I suffer in silence. And it is very difficult. I would much rather devote my life to loving you. Then life would not be as painful as it is. You will receive this letter after the battle. If this be my last letter, Senora, know this, I adore you. Should I win this battle, remember I tried to avoid it, but your father forced it on me. I can neither be a traitor nor a coward. Not even for your sake. God and the Holy Virgin bless you. Senor, it is dawn. Take this. Its destination is... Navarre! [***] [***] Navarre! Castile! [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Count of Castile, you wanted to come to Navarre. Here is Navarre! [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SANCHO GRUNTING] [***] King Sancho of Navarre is dead. Bury Navarrese and Castilians together. We will do for Don Sancho what he would have done for us. Inigo, enshroud him with your own hands. Peribanez, see that he is dressed in the best clothes. You, physician, embalm him. Gustios, prepare the finest litter, one fitting for a great king and fighter. My life is more painful than your death, Don Sancho. CHURCH BELL TOLLS] [WHIMPERING] [GASPS] What I see makes me afraid. We share the same sorrow, my sister. I will avenge his death. I'll excuse your absence, my sister. Castilians, thank you for the respect you have shown a Navarrese king. Leave us now so that we can pray for the soul you took out of his body. Don't worry, your father's death will soon be avenged. The Count of Castile will pay for it. A plague on the Castilians! [***] I curse the act that brought me here. I curse these hands that have caressed you in my dreams. They have killed my father, too. When I saw you in the crypt my mind told me to shout, There is the killer! There is Fernan Gonzalez! Your heart and love was stronger. What was I to do? When I heard your deed sung by the minstrels then I was proud of you. Now when they sing of Don Sancho's death, what do you expect? I know you asked for peace. But my father would not listen. Yet my love for my father says, you must go, senor. Before I go I must remove your doubts. I must make you understand. I think to you that means treason to my people and to myself. Treason would kill love, too. And this is love. Love makes two persons blend into one. Nothing can stop it. There's nothing we can do. Hatred's another face of love. This love endangers your life. My country wants vengeance. If only God were on our side. God helps those who love and believe. But what about my aunt? And the king, my brother? They won't forget as quickly as I do. I'm afraid, senor. I'm afraid and worried for you. Don't be. My life doesn't matter. JERIFAN: Again, Fernan Gonzales rode to Leon. To ask the help of the King of Leon. [DOGS BARKING] [CACKLING] A good way to progress. My niece, the Infanta of Navarre. [CACKLING] I don't know whether I like it or not. But you have one more battle to fight. With my wife. She'd behead her own niece rather than have her married to a Castilian. And I know she would do it. King Garcia of Navarre is too young. My wife's will is what counts. So you will have to strike a bargain with her. [CACKLES] What about you, senor? Hmm. There they go! So he's been arrogant enough to come here. He has been kind enough to accept my invitation. People like that should be whipped! You hate him, don't you? You have forgotten. He killed my brother. I haven't. Here is my decision. You will take care of your affairs and I will take care of mine. [HORSE NEIGHS] You must have reasons for marrying my niece. I do have them. If you think I will refuse, you are wrong. On the contrary, I shall urge Don Garcia to give his permission. I consent, but I will not bless. What moves me is love rather than politics. You don't have to justify your actions. I don't try to because I don't need to. However, there is something I want you to know, senora. All the strength of Navarre and the power of Leon put together would not stop me. This is love, senora. Do you know the meaning of the word? [***] JERIFAN: At the end of the council of Leon, after Don Fernan said all that he had to say this has been the result. From now on Castile will be ruled by Castilians. They'll widen their frontiers within the Moorish land. The Castilians will stop where Fernan's sword will stop. The Infanta was given by the Navarrese to Count Fernan. King Garcia consented. Wedding stipulations will be held in Ciruena. The count and his men, unarmed will come and so will Don Garcia. With love and understanding all will meet in Ciruena. [ALL GIGGLING] This is what they have promised. Will they comply with it? Goodbye. If God does not assist them, they'll behead one another. [LAUGHS] Ciruena. NUNO: We come on a peaceful mission. And not one weapon can be kept. Look, a hermitage. We can leave our weapons there. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Look at him. Dreaming. It's a good thing we'll be with him when he signs the contract, otherwise he'd give his horse away. [ALL LAUGHING] There are two things we must get. Cavalry to fight the Moor and independence. No more yokes. You talk of business while all that takes us to Ciruena is love. [ALL LAUGHING] Let's wake Fernando up. [CACKLES] He won't wake up until he has slept and in good company. [ALL LAUGHING] No more such talk. I don't like this. It doesn't feel like a wedding. Huh, more like a funeral. [***] GRACIA: Greetings, Fernan Gonzales. Welcome to Ciruena. [GRACIA CACKLES] Now, you'll pay for my father's death. Do you like this wedding, Count of Castile? [GRACIA LAUGHING] Take them now! I want him alive. But dead will serve, too. [JERONIMO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] GRACIA: After him! Don't let him escape. [***] Santa Maria! We prayed. Why did you let this happen, senora. Why? Why? Why? Did she do it? Did she? She choose this place. Told us to come unarmed. Was it the Infanta? Was it? GRACIA: Count Fernan Gonzales! Listen, Count Fernan Gonzales, pay attention. You will escape death if you surrender. [BANGING ON THE DOOR] [BANGING ON THE DOOR] Open the door. Don't surrender. A bear in a trap still fights! We'll make them pay! Open the door. Take me but not my men. We don't want them. Castile needs you. Go. Go! You're wasting time. I said go! [***] You, too, Jeronimo. Fernando, senor! I, uh... We've always fought together. Let me stay. I would rather part with this arm then leave you. Our country needs you. You have many things to do. Go! JERIFAN: And so Garcia of Navarro imprisoned Fernan Gonzales deep inside Navarre at the prison of Penafiel where no one was permitted to see him. They have the Count of Castile imprisoned in Navarro. They are divided. Now is the time to strike. It is April. Spring is coming. ZAIDA: It is still cold in Castile, senor. I will order spring to Castile. This will be the first rose. I will give it to your name. Zaida. Castile will be the color of that rose. JERIFAN: And so Abderraman gathered the largest army ever to be seen in Spain. The fierce Moorish Cavalry and foot soldiers moved north into Castile. Their armed might struck fear into all the conquered provinces. Abderraman determined to teach the Castilians and the world a lesson they would not soon forget. Ravaged and pillaged everything in his path. [***] ABDERRAMAN: So this is Castile. It is too bad we cannot meet Fernan Gonzales here. [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] [***] [***] Your highness. Senora. This is not a castle for nobility but a jail. I want to see the Count of Castile. Senora, should anything happen to the prisoner, I would be the only one responsible. Those are the orders of your brother, the king. And I am here to reinforce those orders. I want to see him. You can return to the Court, Captain. Tell his Majesty that his orders are complied with. Energetically. Follow me, senora. I was given orders, senora. I can lose my life. I want to be left alone with him. [***] [GROANS] FERNAN: You're not real. [***] Take my hands. It is not a dream. And my lips, to be certain. Yes, my darling, it is true. You're really here. Oh, my love. Forever, my love, forever. We can leave now. All is prepared. [***] MAN: Stupid fool, letting them escape. No, sir! No, sir! [SCREAMS] [***] JERIFAN: In Castile, the forces of Fernan Gonzales were disorganized and dispirited without their leader. The Castilians were unable to offer any real resistance and could only retreat from pueblo to pueblo, leaving the Moors to do as they wished. You set me free, but now you, too, are a fugitive. From your own brother, your country. What loving he has cost you. I would pay twice the price. Willingly. But what can I give you in return? Exile, the blood, wars, in the end perhaps death at the hands of the Moors. It doesn't matter. I prefer death with you to life without you. The air of Castile, it smells good. I want him back in my hands at any price! I'll lock my sister in a convent! She'll wish she were in hell! Senor, nothing on the road to France. Be damned to both of them! [***] Senor, it is almost dark. Your pace has been too slow. We have been waiting for you since dawn. Waiting for me? Castile is about to perish. The Caliph Abderraman is in Hazinas. The slaughter has been terrible. Who are you? We are Christian cavaliers. [PEOPLE YELLING AND SCREAMING] Carazo Canyon, Senor. That is where they will make their stand. To stay here means death. Carazo Canyon is our only defense. Gustios is right. It is our last hope. Our last bulwark. And also it is the only way for the Moors to reach the heart of Castile. It doesn't matter where we die. Let us bare our claws and fight them here. We can only depend on God's help to defeat Abderraman. Everybody has different opinions, which means that no one knows what to do. We need our leader! Without him we are lost. Hold, cavaliers! We can't let him down. This time he needs us! [PEOPLE YELLING AND SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] JERIFAN: Fernan did not know that his two companions were Santiago, Patron Saint of Spain, and Millan, Patron Saint of Castile. Together they rode to the armored city of Hazinas, the last stronghold before Carazo Pass, the tiny canyon providing the only gateway through the mountains to Burgos and the heart of Castile. [PEOPLE YELLING AND SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [GROANS] [GROANS] [ALL GRUNTING] [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] [ALL YELLING] [***] He's back! Fernan Gonzales is back! [ALL CHEERING] Thank God you're alive. [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] My brothers, the final year has come. I wish I knew what to do now. The first thing should be to meditate. We might all die tomorrow. Who are you to tell us what to do? My name is Millan and I come from La Cogoya. Yago is my name. I was born far away from here. Very close to where the Lake of Tiberias lies. That is Jerusalem. Exactly, senora. The Christian soldiers are shepherds. That is why they fight in the mountains. We will wait for them in the valley. At this point. Here our cavalry will close on them. Pinch them. I place all my faith on my horsemen. We Arabs are half man, half horse. We will open the way to the Canyon of Carazo. Senor, but what about the infantry? [CHUCKLES] Let the Christians use their infantry. The Islamic warrior fight on horseback. GONZALO: There is one thing we cannot overcome. They have too many horses. What do we do about it? Deprive them of their horses. [CACKLES] Fine. How do we convince the Moors to let us take them away! There is a way. Instead of men, we'll send animals. BOTH: Animals? Frightened animals. Stampeding animals. Hmm. An excellent idea. Of course. Why didn't I think of it. Arabs are terrified of certain animals. [CHUCKLES] [SQUEALING] [SCREAMS] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] As Allah wills it, our enemy's clever. [NEIGHING] [CACKLING] FERNAN: If God protects Castile today, I'll build a kingdom out of this corner. An empire out of this kingdom. The price for this empire is your kiss. Here is the kiss. But remember, you must come back to me so I can kiss you again. I can only help you by praying. [CHUCKLES] The prayers of the woman you love are as strong as an additional army. It's enough. [***] Here with us is the strength of Castile. Peribanez and his soldiers with the insignia of the Circles of Medina. Gustios from Covarrubias with his man following the insignia of the Wolf Cubs. Gonzalo and his fighters with the insignia of the Three Hooks. Inigo from Pancorbo and his mountain men who fight in the rocks like birds of prey. * The valley of the sword * * A once divided land * * Came a man to free Castile * * Here to face the Arab steel * * In the valley of the sword * * So strong was his belief * [MOUTHING PRAYER] * One kingdom there should be * * That down this valley green He led * * Men whose blood would Stain it red * * In the valley of the sword * * Few in number But their hearts are strong * * With truth and mind * * Riding forward into battle * God have mercy on them. * For one cause they fight * * Though their faces Show no fear * * Still death is everywhere * Can the saints come down to earth? Why do you ask that, senora? I don't know, Father. I don't know. * And soon throughout This land * * They'll speak of but one man * * Count Fernando is his name * * From his faith Will come a Spain * * In the valley of the sword * Brother, God sent you at the right time. Yes, the right time to undo your wrong. Fernan Gonzalez will get what he deserves. The infidels will take care of him. As for you, I will... Listen! Once you betrayed my love and now you want to kill me. But remember, your name will be spoken about from village to village like, like another king! King Garcia, your sword has a much better use. [***] How can they be in two places at one time? Follow me. I'm going to explain the way men fight. There below Fernan Gonzales will decide not only the destiny of Castile but of all the kingdoms. Those poorly-armed soldiers are the Castilian army. That is all they have. But they will serve as bait. An insignificant bait for Abderraman. Insignificant? The best Castilian horsemen, plus your Navarrese? Navarrese? Mine? Not while I live. I will never allow my soldiers to fight with Castilians. But against them! Forget your hatred for Christian love. Remember where your duty lies. In God's name, forget your pride. Go and do battle. How do you dare? Because truth is always true, be it for kings or for beggars. Halt! Halt. There they are, cavaliers. With only a third of that strength, they could still defeat us. [***] [HORSES NEIGH] They will need all they have. Who told you that, your own intuition? Castile will receive reinforcements. From heaven perhaps. Castile is forgotten. Pray. That's excellent advice. Our Father, who art in heaven, ALL: hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven, give us this day, our daily bread... [***] [HORSE NEIGHS] For Navarre! FERNAN: Garcia of Navarre! And look who's with him! His entire Navarres cavalry. You're right, the devil must be behind this. Or the saints. Look over there. They're cavaliers from Leon! [LAUGHS] Here we are! The entire family, ha, ha! [***] [ALL YELLING] Come back! Come back! It's a trap! It's a trap! Sire. You are needed here. [ALL YELLING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [***] [HORSES NEIGH AND MEN GRUNT] [GRUNTS] [MEN GRUNTING CONTINUES] [***] [GRUNTS] [MEN GRUNTING CONTINUES] [CROWD YELLING] [CROWD SCREAMING] It is written in the stars. This land will never be ours. Captain? Sire? Call the troops for the retreat. [MEN YELLING] [***] [GRUNTS] Jeronimo has their standard! The battle's over! Senor, your victory. Jeronimo! My brother! Jeronimo. My eyes no longer see you, Fernando, but I know it is you. I taught this hand how to use the axe. Do you remember, Fernando? Do you remember a big tree in the woods? This tree is, is my belief. One man to unite the land against the Moors. And this one is you. I won't be able to go back to our woods with you, Fernando. But God let me stay here until the end with you, Fernan Gonzales, Count of Castile. Of Castile! King... [WHIMPERS] [***] Sancha. Once I told you that some day for a kiss I would build an empire. Today is that day. Fernan. Farewell, Cavalier Millan. Farewell, Cavalier Santiago. Farewell, Jeronimo. To you we owe Castile. Great were the wedding celebrations. It was a new history that started from the smallest part of the Spanish soil a kingdom was born. * A love was born * * When their eyes first met * * A love so warm * * That they could not forget * * Inside awoke * * A dream too long a sleep * * A dream that now * * Was theirs to keep * * Her gentle voice * * Spoke and it began * * And soon it echoed * * Far across the land * * From both their hearts * * A lonely part was torn * * That moment when * * A love was born * [***]
