You keep saying but... It's your fucking kids. I know you have the cash. I'm watching every move you make. No police. No telling anyone. Okay? Okay. I understand. Any funny business, any or fuck me over, and they're dead. Under... fucking... stand? Put the lights on. It's on the right. I know. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Huh! What were you thinking? You've only gotta killed him. Mr. Phoenix is calling Fuck! Fuck! Well, you've broken it now. We didn't need to kill him. We only needed her. He was trying to be a hero. Kidnap a girl, easy money. Now, you fucked it. I need a fucking drink. That's not going to help. Shut up! Let's just say it was an accident. Or he walked into a fucking brick wall? We still have her. We had a chance to walk away with a cash. Let's go get some kidnap. Yeah, there's a big difference here girl, between five and 15 fucking years. It's not stopped you from killing before. What did you say? We're not going to get caught, if you calm down. Calm? Calm is when you're fucking up a bad day at the golf course, you lose at the casino. That is fucking calm. You. Watch her. Angel, come on. Come with me. You okay? Whoa huh hu What do you think? You keep saying okay when it's not. It's not okay. Listen. Babe, why did you close? What just happened? Just, just stay calm. Me? What about you and the drinking? If I want to have a drink, I'll have a drink. Okay? I knew this was a mistake. Listen, we just stick to the plan. We will be okay. She's not right. I told you she's completely changed this plan. We just need the cash. And you told me her plan was solid. It is. And I will make it alright, okay? We don't know what she's capable of. I just want to fix the situation, the pressure's got to me - you know. - It's, it's murder! Just let me think. I can't do this. Yes, you can. You know, we're nearly there. Trust me. I don't want to hurt those kids, but we need the cash. Hurt? You go in there and you set her straight. Now! She's not stupid. What do you think you were playing at? I was trying to be nice. Nice? Get... your hands off me. You are fucking pushing me. Let go. We've, I've got a plan. - What are you going to do? - And you are not fucking following it. - get off! No more fuck ups. Say you understand. Say it! - Lou! Lou! - Get back over there! - Angel! - What? Angel! Shh. It's okay. There's a kit. Can you stand? Hey. What's happening? This is going to be fine. What's going on? Louis, you need to listen to me. I'm glad you're alive. You and your sister have been kidnapped. Okay? You need to follow three simple rules. One, behave. No heroics. It's not the fucking movies. Two... Are you listening? Two, if we say something you just do it. No questions. Finally, I don't want to hear a peep out of the two of you. Do you understand? If you do that, you'd be out of here in a couple hours. - And if we don't? - Trust me, you don't want to know. Well, I don't feel right. You have a concussion. Good, that's cooperating. All we want is the cash. But I don't understand. What did I just say to you? Just shut up! Huh? Tie him up when you're finish, Angel. But he can barely stand. Just make sure he behaves. Just stay still. I'm going to go and check the tracker. No fuck ups. You're going to be fine. Okay? Thanks. Your Balaclava. -Yeah. The other two don't, the other two don't seem bothered. That's them. You're gonna have a headache. Yeah. How do you know this? When we tried to grab Elizabeth, you freaked out. We have to stop here. Okay. I mean, you want money? Yeah? What if you don't get it? You'll be fine. - I needed a doctor. - He said be quiet. - He's just... - He's just not being quiet. - He's just a kid. He's our pay day. You'll survive. Should I lock the door? No need. Nasty. I'm the one that hit you. Thought you were dead. Look, we got off on the wrong foot. - I can get a bit hotheaded. - My hands. They're hurting. I can't take it off. Got enough trouble with your gag. Just relax. - How long before... - My shrink says I have a chronic mental disorder. Your shrink? Yeah. But don't tell those two our little secret. Why? I was in prison for a little time. My shrink's name is Patience. I kid you not, Patience. Big African lady didn't take any shit. I think it doesn't hurt. It hurts. Leave me alone. Why? I was trying to be nice. Not being vexatious, am I? No. Annoying? You think you're pretty special, don't you? - No. - Oh, I think you do. Mommy and daddy buy you everything you've every wanted. - You don't know that. - Really? - 50K just lying around. - How would you- I even know they're not your real mom and dad. They are. Oh, she talks. He needs rest. Here's a joke. This woman, she has twins, but she gives them up for adoption. Now, one of them goes to a family in Egypt and they named him Amal. The other one goes to a family in Spain and named him Juan. Now, years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his real mother. Now, when she receives it, she turns to her husband and she says, "I really wish I had a picture of Amal." Now, the husband, actually, he just turns to her and says, "They're twins. When you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal." You get it? You've seen one, you've seen them all. What about your family? Don't talk about me. Ever. I tried to be nice. You're in the seal. Daddy better pay. He's not. Oh, you're the valiant one. Now, say "Ah". You're hurting him. Say it. Please. Stop! Steady. Good. Now, we know. Hey, I'm okay, Iz. She's crazy. Hey, come on now. Don't think about it like that. Yeah? It's not gonna help. - But, they hurt us. - Hey, we can't be paralyzed thinking about what might happen. Now we need to, we need to think how to get out. Hey, you're listening? Remember at school, you know when they locked you in the swimming changing rooms. You didn't panic then. - It's not the same. It is the same. Now don't think about the problem, yeah? Think of the solution. Yeah. I know. You sound like dad. And you panicked about dumping Amylyn because she took too many selfies. Well, she was self-obsessed. Oh, my head. - I thought you were dead. - Not yet. We need to get you to a hospital. Well, that's not going to happen. - Sorry. - What for? Getting upset. Oh, no, come on. But you are smarter and tougher than you think. Wait, wait, they didn't lock the door. What are you doing? Hold on. Stop, stop. Move. Lou, we can't. I'll just close the door. We've got things to do. This is a piece of shit But I checked it. I was here yesterday. - Yeah. But that was yesterday. - Maybe restart it? - Done that. Is it poor connection? What the fuck does that even mean? Huh? Fuck it! Shit. I might know a way. Unless a You remember the security guy? Bernard? - Archie. - Whatever. - Message him. - And what's that supposed to help to you? He might know why it's not connecting. You know what? While you're there, why don't you ask him if he can give some tips for fucking kidnapping? Yeah. Is it safe? As long as you pay him every month, he don't care. So, we message him, yeah? - Yes, sir. - Just do it because without that GPS, we don't know where he is. What will happen? Christ's sake. Angel, questions, huh? Believe it or not. Before this technology, people still got kidnapped. - What if... - What if what? Sent. Let me know if you see a big one there, okay? I'll go and check on the kids. Give me the gun. For fuck's sake, Bernie. Lock the door! Fuck! Just because that door is open, doesn't mean the others aren't locked. Nobody can hear you we're in the middle of nowhere. So, just behave. - The woman with the gun. - Yeah, I have it now. I don't like her. Good. Then you won't try any shit with us. She's scared. Being scared is good. You won't do anything fucking stupid. Hmm. Take it. What if Dad goes to the police? That would be a big mistake. I don't know if he gets that stupid. You don't know him. Oh, I do. We've done our homework. - He's been in the forces. - He's not the only one. - You've been in the forces? - Yeah. I did my bit for queen and country. And look what country got me? He's going to want to find you. I hope so. Because he might be the toughest man on this planet. When it comes to your kids being threatened, it's a whole different ball game. Trust me. My hands hurt. - Tough. - Louis doesn't have it. Yeah. Well, Louis nearly died. - If you get caught, you go to prison. - I won't. You've done this before? - No joke. Enough questions, huh. You've only been here for five minutes and you're doing my head in. Do you want your gags back in? Fuck's sake. - You drink a lot? - Hmm. Not enough. How's your head Louis? - She's dangerous. - Yeah? Take this. Crying is not going to help. So, you two are brother and sister. Yeah? It's obvious you're not. We are. You're not. Bernie says you were adopted. So? How old were you? I was a baby. He was three. You ever thought about finding out about your family? We don't need to find out. - Why not? - Not worth knowing. Okay. Mess with us... - Shut up! - Don't really remember? He's not our friend. Okay? Look, he's trying to kill us. People say blood's thicker than water. It's rubbish. Love, caring in there. It's more important than blood. That's all we've known. True. My dad was a real bastard. No surprise there. He's a real fucking piece of- Sorry for that. - What if that goes off? - It won't. The safety's on. - Is it even loaded? - It's pointless if it is not. Hmm. I know. Hmm? Why don't we all get adopted? What do you think? My dad was a real piece of work. Used the pan on my mom said she was black and blue. Then it would startle me. You're right. You can choose your friends, but not your family. You two are pretty clever, aren't you? Yeah. Well, she's the - clever one. - So, what are you? The dunce? Being kidnapped by you, - I must be. - I like it. Okay, clever clowns. I got something for you. What's greater than God, more evil than a devil? Rich people want it, poor people have it. And if you eat it, you die. What's he doing? Updating? Fuck. Come on. Is that...? - I can't fucking believe this. - What's up? It's still on the fucking drive. It hasn't even fucking moved. Fuck! I'm going to ring this dickhead. Fuck's sake. - Hello? - Yes, hello. I'm here. Where the fuck are you? I'm on my way. - Don't lie to me, motherfucker. - I'm not lying. Listen, I know you're fucking lying to me. No, I won't. I'm not. Do you not care about these fucking kids, huh? Lie to me one mother fucking time, I dare you. I don't understand. If you don't start telling the truth, mate, I'm going to start cutting off fucking fingers. - Okay. I'll send someone. - What? - My brother. - Fuck your brother, Ant. What the fuck? I couldn't leave Chalbasupsa. I was working by the police. You're fucking insane. - I'm really sorry. - Fucking stutterer. Stay calm. Can he be trusted? Of course, he can. I promise. I didn't tell him why I needed the money. I didn't disclose it. Lie to me one more time. I swear. I won't. Tell him. We've been watching you, the house, the car, everything. Now, when you get the money, I want you to use that car to bring it to us. Right. I didn't realize that. Yeah, you didn't, you fucking dickhead. Now, listen up. I want to see that fucking car moving. Okay. Okay. This guy's a fucking prick. Hello? Now, listen up. What I said to you before, you drive into Hampton. You drive through there onto the B 42, into the countryside. Three miles down that lane on the left hand side is Aston Country Park. Do you understand? Yeah. Now I realize, hadn't I? How are they? Oh, they're fine. - Please don't hurt them. - Ant, that's entirely up to you, mate. Fuck him. - So, what's going on? - He's just not thinking, you know? - What if he calls the police? - If he calls the police? Fucking hell. Geez, I don't think he's that stupid. Then again, I don't know. And this brother thing? Fucking Christ, Angel. Question after question. Huh? - Next time, you ring the prick. - I'll ring him. You had enough. He ended up hanging himself. - You need to sit down. They see here. - There's got to be some way to get attention in here. They'll hear you. - But I got to do something. - I'm frightened. Well, you're hurt, too. I don't think they're going to hurt us. What if... Dad... dad is going to pay. Okay? Lou! Come on. Sit back down. What are you doing? - Just stretching my legs. - Well, don't. My hands' hurting from the ties. I don't give a shit. Sit back down. It's just a little concussion. Will he be okay? - He'll be fine. - Now, shut up. You drank vodka before? No. - For the pain. - Lou, no! Don't waste it. Daddy let you drink the good stuff. I don't need permission. Oh? Like that you do. Stop! Why don't you have a drink? Don't wanna. You crazy kids might catch me out. Dad, is he sorting the money? Yes, he is. How much longer? Soon. If he gets his act to go. - Don't say that. - Your old man's a bit thick. He's not. You are. Shut- - Leave her alone. - Stop it! - Leave her. Get up. - Blondie, it's me. - It's the security guard. What the fuck does he want? I don't know. Give me the keys. I know you're in there, Blondie. Get up. Take them next door. Listen. No heroics, okay? You, her and me, okay? Go! Blondie, let him in. The boss magnet? How are you? Ouch. Tuco. -The boyfriend? Fucking mad. Tuco, what was that? - Mexican? - Spanish. Motherfuckers are true. From the Latin code, I don't give a fuck. And? So what are you guys up to then? What for? Connection. Oh yeah. No pops princess. Is that a taser? Mind your business. You're a bit nerdy. I just don't like nosy people. Me nosy? Did we pick up on the wrong foot? Empty drink. What tea? Vodka. Now, you twinkie. Oh, now that hits the spot. Ahh That blood, taser, blood. You guys are naughty. Oh, good stuff. I love that cheap shit. - You don't drink do you? I didn't realize. - Not today. Cool. I mean, I respect, I respect people who don't drink. They, they usually have issues. - Now they can't handle their drink. - I don't have issues. That odor allergic. I don't think we suffer any allergies - Do we Tuco? - People who have issues still drink. That's why I said I respect people who don't. They know they can't handle it Self-discipline, self-awareness I respect that. That's you and me, Tuco. We don't give a fuck. Do you work with Nads? 12 hours, six to six. That's long. Used to it, all I've ever known. Have you done security? It's not really security, is it? A few trunks along for a few stray cats, shit like that. You've got junkies. Not much around too, is that? I mean, what exactly do you do? We make a few phone calls. Phone calls? What sort of button calls? Listen, we pay you good cash every month. So we don't get any fucking questions. Huh? You don't just fucking come around. When you feel like it. Louder fucking chaos, Sir! Not very tactical of your boyfriend, isn't he? Huh? What's in the next room? Knock, knock? Who's there? Don't do that. Okay, cool. Maybe you're right. I'm a bit of a nosy cunt. You see ever since childhood, I've always had this insatiable curiosity snooping around, but prying into other people's affairs. Perhaps I should exercise more discretion. Nice to see you, princess. You, well, not so nice. Oh, by the way, discretion has just gone up 500. Not probably much. I fucking hate that name. Mind you, it's not as bad as if Archibald had. That name, I truly fucking hate it. Five fucking hundred pound. Fucking prick. Pay him it. Everything alright? Yeah. Bring the, bring them back in. Come on. Move. We're not moving, he's not well. He cannot breathe with that on. - You'll do, as you're told. - I want to know what's happening? Just do as we say, and you'll be fine. I want the guts and ties off. I'm not doing that. Then we don't move. Look, you'll have to behave. Behave? I thought he was dead. It wasn't me. No, that free me up. How are you feeling? Rough. He needs to see a doctor. I'll get him some tablets, alright? What about her? You don't need to worry about her. We clearly do. Look, we just want the money. That's all. Why are you doing this? Let's just say, I owe them. Help us. Look, come on. You need to move. Come on. -We're not moving. Do you think this is going to help things? I want the ties off. Damn this. I'm off. You're unwell. I'll be okay. You don't know that. Dad You can't count on that Lou. You said when you think about how to get out. You're right. I don't think I can. What if, what if we just stay here? You know? Just wait it out. Dad said always look for opportunities. You've seen the way they argue. Angel and Blondie hate each other. Well, they argue but... I think angel would help us. She follows Tuco too. Hey, come on, sit down, please. The more control we give them more confident they become. We need to fight. What good will that do? It will give us chances. Have you seen what they did to me? Yeah what she did. We can split them. Remember when we were young and that dog attacked me? You always said dogs could sense fear. I can sense it. Angel's scared. Maybe, but... What did I say? Huh? Get up. No! Ugghh Oh? You, bitch! Don't touch me again. I will cut your nose up you little cunt. No! Put that away. This little shit. You... get in there with your brother, now. If you hurt them, we get nothing. Don't tell me what I can and can't do. He's on the move. Get Tuco. Tuco? Hey! Hey, what the fuck happened to her face? Huh? She kicked me in the vagina. She's a kid, for Christ's sake. So? Look. At last. Is he going in the right way? Hold on. No? Fuck. Yes. Yes. He's fucking working. Fuck the Lord. Drinks, guys? Come on. We did it. Cheers! Cheers. One's not going to hurt you. Come on, come on. That's my girl. Come here. I'll kill them when we have it. Yeah, won't we all? 🎶 🎶 🎶 We've got a problem. What? What problem? They know us. And? They are not stupid. Exactly. So, you trust them? What do you suggest? Just saying. Listen, I'll have a word with them. Okay? Up to you... You're an idiot. I said I will sort it. Am I an idiot? Go on. I'm not a murderer. No. You just get people to do your dirty work. Come on, girls. You know, we're nearly there. Tell this bitch to stay away from them. I knew you didn't have the stomach for this. No, I'm just not a psychopath. Enough. Go. Don't point at me. I'm not a fucking dog. Go. Wanker! Are you okay? You two are are such a perfect friends. I've not seen her like this. She's completely off the rails. Let's stop fighting. She's all about murder. She's not, you just brought it in yourself up girl. Come on. She's obsessed with these kids. Just breathe. Yeah? She made it sound so simple but it's not. They've seen us. Just stop worrying. Stop drinking. Listen, we'll be long gone before they even get a fiction to the police. Huh? You know, I'm gone really protective of you. Yeah. I'm not going to let anybody hurt you again. Do you remember when you killed a fox? Yeah acts as if it's on purpose. I felt so bad. Don't worry about it. There's something I've been wanting to do. This... Genuinely want you to have... You're a terrible romantic. No. It's beautiful. Thank you. You know what, when this is over... I'm about to choose you. What about blondie? No, no. I do. It's all I think about too, you know. You can't say it. But I just want you to keep it together for me, you know. I will. For you. Tuco! We have a problem. What? I can't find the phone. Well What's going on? Where was the last place you saw the phone? Back at the flat then... Shit. For fucks sake, Angel. Huh. Messages, passwords, everything is on that phone. I can go. I'm sorry. I just... We need that phone. I thought we said not to go back. That was the one thing we need. Blondie. Listen. I'm warning you, okay? You've got the kids. Keep the gun. Keep them quiet. You two, listen... Behave, okay? Be careful. I can't believe I was so stupid. Oh, I can. If he gets caught now? Oh, yeah, well, it's done. Can we have some water? No. Shut up. I'm worried about him. Hold on. Hold it here. How much longer? Your dad, he's on his way. Ohh yay~daddy! Why do that? -That commodity? They are just kids. Valuable kids. Exactly. Which is why we need to look after them. Sometimes you can be a real bitch. Only sometimes? You got a boyfriend? Just stop it. Shes just like you. Where's all this coming from? I see you, not him. Whatever you're thinking, you're wrong. Is that right? You don't scare me. Yeah But you should. Just go and check the GPS. I can't deal with your shit right now. - Your bodyguard is not here. - Why? What are you going to do? You forget? You were no one when we met, you had nothing, just a lonely weirdo. Oh yeah, what are you? Some freak you has to blow in a bag every time she thinks she's dying. - You think you're something you're not. - I know who I am. Do you? Really? You're never quiet sure, are you? Do you know why? Because you are too stupid to care. Do not call me stupid. If it wasn't for me, you would still be fixing your broken bones and your stupid fucking face. I was leaving him. No, you weren't. You're too weak. I saved you. Tuco saved me. Fuck anything that comes your way. All you ever done, all you'll ever do. Yeah. Well, it seems to work with Tuco. You'll regret that. Fuck!! Fuck!! Fuck. Fuck. Bitch I think she stopped. She's crazy. She'll kill us. - Let's go. - I can't. You can't. You can. Look, this money, it's new life for me. Let's go and I'll get you the money. I wish it was that simple. Just sit down, please If she comes in here. Anything could happen. She could kill us all. She wouldn't. Did you not hear that? Look, Tuco will be back soon, okay? The keys, you need to get them off her. Just sit down. -Keys. Look, you're making things worse. Sit down. Keys. What's going on? Nothing. Then why someone shout keys? They didn't. What was all that about in there? I was pretending everything was your fate. And what do you think Tuco would say about that? Does this face look bothered? So, keys? Do you want a warm drink? Oh yeah. The answer to the world's problems. Fucking tea. You're crazy. I'm getting a little bit sick of you. Let's see how tough you really are. I wanted the keys. Angel said no. What? This keys? What are you gonna do when you get them? Put it away. Go on, keep telling me what to do. Just grow up. The only reason you use that knife is because without it, you're a coward. A coward, really? You're a coward. No wonder why Glen fucking hated you. It's me. Get back to your corner. Say anything, and I kill you both. What's going on? Nothing. Look at me. Look at me. Calm down. Come on. Breathe. Breathe, Angel. I'm here now. Jesus, what happened? Nothing. We just, we had a disagreement. That's all. Did you get the phone? Yeah, thank God for that. Tea? Anyone? How's the GPS? There's a lot of issues. What do you mean issue? The laptop stopped working. How? I don't believe you two. It's nothing to do with me. What do you mean it's nothing to do with you? For fuck's sake. You two, in here. Lock the other door. What the fuck happened? I got stressed. Is that a fucking joke? Oh, no. Fuck. You fucked us. We can sort it. Sort it? He could be on his way to the police now and we wouldn't even know. He knows we've got a tracker on him. He gave us some kind of control. Tuco. Oh. Shut the fuck up. Huh? I leave you for five minutes. What the fuck happened? - Well, I can't control her. - I got stressed. - Stressed? - It's a stressful situation. Stressed? Why fuck the room up? Why not? Why not? Because I fucking trusted you and everyone. Who's everyone? Everyone says, don't trust that fucking bitch. Oh, don't give me that shit. You picked us both up, young bait that you can just bullshit any time you like? Well, you know what? You made a mistake because I'm not some young naive bitch that you can just screw anytime. You're crazy. - Yep. Say it again. - So this is what it's come down to? Hmm? Name-calling? You two used to be friends. Whoa! Why now? Huh? We got rid of that bastard fool and this how she repays me? You don't talk about that anymore. You listening? You two have fucking lost it. She has. Yeah. Well, you should've done something about it. Huh? I don't care that you don't love each other anymore. It's about the money. She's a danger to those kids and you know it. Hello? You've kidnapped them. She's right. You're getting too close. She's been in school. He's coughing a vodka. You are only here because of him and because you owe me. I'm warning you about her. Fuck, gun? Stop don't do anything silly. I'll do it. Just calm down, Louis. Piss off. Okay. But that's loaded. I want you to unlock the outside door. Now. Wayne is on his way and then we'll let you go. You're lying. I'm not. She won't. It's not up to her. Are you sure about that? Go on then. Shoot me. Please, just let us out. You, a murderer. Shut up. Hey, you ain't helping. I do. Louis, look at me. Have you ever shot a gun before? Hey, what are you doing? - Let's see you went straight. - Let her go. Put the gun down. Please, just let us go. Put the gun down and we'll let you go. Louis, Louis, look at me. We will let you go. Trust me. Don't give it to her. Come on. Look, you don't want this. You can't forget murder. Don't. Come on. It's okay. I can't. Get off. Jesus. Give me the gun. I told you. Let's get something straight, okay? When we get the money, we're going to let you go. Have you got any broken bones or busted teeth that's up to you. Do you understand what I'm saying? Keep your conceit. What would you have done? I would have shot. You wouldn't. I don't get it. Why can't you just behave? - You expect us not to fight? - Yes. - Can you please take him to hospital? - No. No. No. It's too late for that. The money's already on its way. You keep saying that. Well, it's your fucking dad. Shit. Hey, watch them. Why me? - What? - Tell her to watch them. I can't believe this is an argument. - I don't mind. - Shut up. You treat me like shit. Watch them. Angel. You should have pulled the trigger. I'm sure, you would have. You're getting more confident. I like that. Things not going well for you? No, things aren't going well for you. My step dad, he was a real junk. Never used guns. Always said guns mean hassle. A knife... a knife, this person... it can inflict real pain. I find it ironic that if you get caught with a gun, you get... five years? A knife, however, if you get caught with a knife... you just get a slap on the wrist. I'll scream. Try it. Either of you... try anything again. You're right about one thing... I'm... Here's a story about 25 years ago, this woman, this married woman, or for argument's sake, let's call her Mrs. Slut. She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. She had long curly hair big, beautiful eyes. And she named her, Bella. But the thing is Mrs. Slut had a bit of a dilemma. You see, she didn't really want a baby, but she had an affair and ended up pregnant. Please. Now, her husband had this outstanding military record and he knew all about Mrs. Slut had a daddy fucking home. How? I, I hear you ask. Cause he knew he was firing blanks and he knew that Bella wasn't his. So Bella ending up, being an embarrassment to both of them. Speaking of sluts. -What? Nothing. - He wants a word. - Now? Now! To be continued. Talk to me. About? You. You got off the rails. We're in this together. That's what you said. Nothing has changed. You sure? I think you forget that this was my idea. What are you thinking? What's on your mind? You and Angel are getting pretty cozy. I'm fond of you both. You know that. It's supposed to be us, three. It is. You would kill for her, you wouldn't kill for me. I would do same for you, if someone was threatening you, your life. Prove it. How? Fuck me now on the desk. What? Like it used to be. - But they are next door. - So? Sorry, no. I knew it. Listen, we can fuck all you want after this. You can't do it or can you? If I had two dogs, I wouldn't treat them the same. Dogs? You know what I mean. Oh, you could love both though right? I do. You're a liar. I'm a liar. You know what that makes me? Great at spotting a liar. Situations come and go. We'll get back to normal after this. After this... after this, we're done. You want to think, but you don't. You just react. You'd fuck this up for all of us. Once this is over. I never want to see you again. Blondie. Fuck. I hope so. Blondie. Go and check if the tracker is working. Come on. You two, clean the glass up. What? Don't question me. Just do it. Fucking kids are unbelievable. Let's have a seat. He's not well, he needs a hospital. We need your dad now, and then you'll be free. You really think she'll let you? It's not up to her. - You need to be careful. - What's happening? She's dangerous. I knew it would be dangerous. Most people don't show it, but she does. Why? Why what? Why this? Just like you, I do have a brother. Used to look out for me. Took care me. Even when my dad was pounding on me, he always stick up for me. And then he was gone. What happened? He wasn't successful, wanna know? Went to Iraq. I'm sorry. It's okay. He left me a letter saying, he was happy to die at 40. He lived it. So why do this? It's a long story. That would be the wrong crowd, you know? That's all I knew in life. You don't think it's going to work out? Workout? Are you surprised? It will, trust me. Okay? When we get the money. I'm going to drop you both to the hospital. I just needed you to give us a bit of time. Just tell the police you're in shock or something. Blondie? Don't worry about her. I've got her under control. We got a deal? Okay. Laughing? The riddle? That's what she said, nothing. No. I told you. What are you doing? What have you done? Wait! How can you do that to her? It's me. You still want in? Good. Come and get the keys. Now. Hello? I'm Blondie. Who? Well, what happened to the guy I was speaking to? Tuco is busy. You're dealing with me. But I don't know you. I'd rather speak to the man. Hello? Dad, just do whatever she says. Iz, are you okay? Iz? Just get the money dad. Now, please. How's Louis? Iz. How's Louis? Dad, just do it. Don't worry, I'm bringing the money, don't worry. I'm not Tuco. Fuck with me and they are dead. I'm nearly there, I'm nearly there. Same drop-off, car pack, 10 minutes. I'm nearly there, please don't touch them. Please. - Are you listening? - Good boy. Im nearly there, please. You seem different, more compliant Tuco? Shame. I liked him. He didn't. You are nasty. Like one of those cute fairy little animals. That you stroke that rips your fucking head off Now remember... I'm not involved in any of this murder shit. Shut up. Hey, come on. I thought we had an understanding? Do as I say, and you'll get paid. No need to be so fucking nasty princess. Is there a problem, princess? 10 grand. Reasonable. What about those two? They are fine. They don't look fine to me. In fact, they look fucking far from fine. We've got ten minutes. Aston country car park. Parking space Where we first met. How romantic. Wow. I love your thinking. Don't get sloppy. Cover your tracks. One thing I know is sloppy done. That car park is sloppy. Just get going. Oh, fuck me. Don't mess it up. Do you? Go. Bye Tuco. I loced him. Why Angel? She brainwashed him. What killed her boyfriend before he beat her to death. How does she repay me? By taking a one true, decent thing from my life? I couldn't live with that. Don't move. Lou? Lou, wake up. Lou? We need to do something or she will kill us. What? I'm tired. No. You stay awake. Lou, what did you say? What day is it? Be careful. What can go wrong? You open the door and let us out. That might kill me. It's enough. Have you ever used it before? Stop. Your brother, he's a gutless wonder. You You're a little cunt. Remember my story? It called Bella. Enough. You need to hear this. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Slut... they have this problem. They didn't want anyone to know about this baby. So... they had two options. They could throw in the canal or they can give it to care. Now, being the loving parents that they were, they gave her up And now for several years, beautiful, bouncy Bella... moved around the care system until she found a wonderful new home. A lovely family where the step dad loved her that much he decided to use her for the next ten years. Now, when Bella was 16 she decided, well... she had enough. And decided to stab her stepdad to death. Unfortunately for her, it didn't work. So she ended up in prison where she was diagnosed with having a chronic mental disorder. What does this... You need to hear this fairytale ending. Now, after all these years, Mr. And Mrs. Slut they finally realized that actually they do want children. Well, you know what they did? They adopted a little girl, and a little boy and gave them everything they ever wanted. That's a lie. How do you think... Mrs. Slut and Mr. Slut would feel? Bella took something from them. Iz? No. No. Iz! Please, no. Oh my God, iz. A KIDNAP
