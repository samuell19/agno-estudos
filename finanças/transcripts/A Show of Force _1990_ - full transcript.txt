MAN: Battalion! MAN: Ready! Fire! MAN: Fire! WOMAN: Permiso. Permiso. Permiso. Permiso. Permiso. Can I see your pass? Okay.Meléndez! Somebody took a shot at the governor, and you missed it. He's still standing there waving. Brave guy. Happy Constitution Day. We're going to the beach. Are we the last ones? We work a little harder. TOUR GUIDE : Attention. Come to the Constitution Day parade in Old San Juan Plaza. Free bus rides to the Constitution Day parade. Hear the governor speak. Let's celebrate. Where's the fucking taxi? It'll get here. Alfredo, we've been waiting here an hour already. Hey, it's a holiday.What? You assholes wanna back out or something? Chucho-- Because your enthusiasm's killing me here, man. Hey, we're doing it, all right? We're doing it! We're not just bullshitting anymore, you know? Did you call for a cab, muchachos? This is going to be a great day, my friends. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let me out of here. Take the cab. Shut your face! Puerto Rico's 26th anniversary as a U.S. Commonwealth. Although that's not good enough for the campaigning governor. He wants July 25th to celebrate the day Puerto Rico becomes the 51st state. This is Kate Meléndez, Channel 74 News. Don't miss the band. Here they come. CROWD: Que bonita bandera, que bonita bandera ♪ Que bonita bandera, la bandera puertorriqueña ♪ Que bonita bandera ♪ Our Commonwealth status isn't good enough for the Ponce Firehouse Band either. They're in favor of independence. As you can hear, they're playing what's become their theme song at these parades, "Que Bonita Bandera." The anthem of the Independentistas. We're not gonna hurt you. Don't worry. We're revolutionaries.Oh, my God! Please, slow down. My car, it's all I have. Would you just shut up? But where are you taking me? What are you going to do with me? Hey, back off! Hey! Hey! I told him to shut up. He didn't shut up. He didn't listen. This is what happens, huh? This won't take long. Just in case you had a good idea, huh? Governor. Huh? Okay, pan to the man over there. MAN: Your attention, please. Please, I have an announcement. Please, please. I have an announcement. Do you have sound?Yeah. GOVERNOR: I was just informed that the police have beaten back a group of Independentista terrorists who were trying to blow up the communications towers at Cerro Maravilla in Toro Negro Forest. The terrorists refused to surrender, and they were killed in a gun battle that they started with the police. One brave officer was wounded. Now, this incident in our Constitution Day serves to put Mr. Castro on notice that he cannot export his Communist terrorism to Puerto Rico. MAN : Base reading you. Headed in? Not if you want the biggest story of the summer, and I don't mean the parade. Don't tell me on the two-way. The competition will be all over your ass. Nobody's listening, Howard. Everybody's wrapped for the day. Don't you believe it. They'll unwrap. How big? Cops and bodies, and it's better than it sounds. Make the 6:00? We always do. The captain's right over there. You looking for a statement? Buenos días,Señora Meléndez. ¿Cómo estás? Captain. CAPTAIN: The undercover agent working with the terrorists had alerted us of the plan. The officers instructed them to drop their weapons, but they opened fire. The officers hit the ground and in self-defense, from a prone position, returned fire, killing both of the men.MAN: Stop it. What's that guy doing there? I never even noticed him. Well, pull him out. He looks like a stray dog. Okay. Keep going. --defense, from a prone position, returned fire, killing both of the men. KATE: The two dead men were identified as Alfredo Ruiz and Jorge Rey. Both were students known to be sympathetic to the Independentista cause. The undercover agent, Jesus Fuentes, was also shot. He's hospitalized tonight, wounded in the abdomen, but he is expected to recover. This is Kate Meléndez, Channel 74 News. You didn't shoot the explosives. Yeah, well, they'd already been taken down the hill. Oh, yeah, and we couldn't get any confirmation, but we saw this older guy looking kind of worked over being brought down in a jeep. Since nobody knows what I'm talking about, you know I'm talking about something. Kind of like a third bad guy, you mean? Oh, man, he wouldn't have looked that good. Maybe a witness. WOMAN: Can you believe it? KATE: Hello! Mommy!Hi, how's my girl? I missed you.Oh. Where's your brother? He's in his room. Juanito! KATE: Juanito! You ready for dinner, Miss Kate? Well... when this show's over. How's Blanca doing? You never want to watch. You could learn something from her. She knows how to have a good time. So do I. If I could get married again... Except I don't want to. You don't wanna go out either. You sound just like my mother. Hi, Mom. Hi. You didn't hear me come home? Uh-uh. What'd you do today? Nothing. Did you go to the beach?Yeah. Was it nice?Very nice. JUANITO: Really nice. KATE: Hmmm. JUANITO: Mom, women can't see this. MAN: Okay, if you need any help, you give me a call. Thanks a lot. Since you two almost know each other, I'll make it official. I'm one of the good guys. Then I'm glad to meet you. HOWARD: Kate Meléndez.Oh, I watch the show. Frank's a-- He's a source.Yeah? Yeah. You need a fact checked, you need something reconfirmed on background, you, uh... You give me a call. It's one of my services. Nice to meet you.Likewise. Well... It was just a courtesy. Why didn't you tell me he was FBI when you had me cut him out of the footage? He's one of the best sources we have around, okay? You should've told me. I hate not knowing things. KATE: One of the students killed at Cerro Maravilla was Jorge Rey, son of Professor Rey, head of the history department at the University of Puerto Rico. My son, Jorge, he was not a terrorist. He was not a revolutionary. He was an Independentista. And so am I, as you all know. It's not a capital crime. The police also claim that my son and Alfredo Ruiz were killed instantly. Then I want to know, why was my son so bruised? I want the medical examiners to explain that to me. What bruises, professor? He was battered. KATE: Alfredo Ruiz, sociology student, leaves a wife and a 10-month-old baby. Do you want to talk about Alfredo's politics? He loved to read. Do you know the police are calling him a revolutionary? He was a good husband. He was a real good father. Him and Jorge and I don't know who else, they go to cafeterias and bars, and they talk. But he always came home. Except yesterday. I want to show you something. Can I show you something, missus? That's what I have left. The police came, and they look everywhere. That's okay. But they took everything. Open it. CARLA: That's the "personal effects," they call them. I went to the morgue. His father and I went. I wasn't even sure it was Alfredo for a second. His face... the whole side of his face, it was all busted open. We just finished paying for his glasses. I went to the morgue. His father and I went. I wasn't even sure it was Alfredo for a second. His face... the whole side of his face, it was all busted open. A spokesman for the police department says that the bruises seen by the families were caused when the two boys fell down an embankment when they were shot. Insert the bit with the governor here. Cerro Maravilla was a triumph for the forces of law and order over the forces of terrorism and subversion. How were we supposed to meet them? With white gloves, a friendly greeting? A message of surrender with flowers? It is a case of charges and countercharges-- I still don't like it, Meléndez. It's aired. I want a piece on the wounded undercover again, okay? I'm on the phone. Fuck your preconceptions. How many times do I have to tell you, there are two sides to every story? Now, you wanna pick one, go work for editorial. You still talking to me? Okay, all right. How about a piece on the undercover agent? Hey, you remember the explosives? I just found out the DA's office is going to announce there weren't any. The guy said to just ask. I'll be back. ¿Dónde vive Fuentes? Over there, señora. Gracias. I thought you were going to be taller. Nope. You ever see these? Heard about it. So they can draw blood with every strike. But you didn't come here to talk about cocks, did you? My 10-year-old likes dirty words too. Can someone go get my crew for me? Domingo. All the other reporters already interviewed me. Where were you? Other assignments. Because I could take that personally. But why bother? True. So how you doing now? You look pretty well recovered. Oh, yeah? You think so, huh? Check it out. Pretty impressive, huh? They just took the bandages off. Doesn't look so bad to me. What do you know? The bullet grazed me. I could have died, lady. So you took a taxi up there? How do you know that? It's in the police report. DOMINGO: Here they are. Let's just do it right here. I never heard of the Armed Revolutionary Movement before. It's a four-man cell, including myself. Two are dead, you're a hero. Who's missing? Missing? "Missing." That's the right word for it. He went underground right after the attack. I figure the radical students are hiding him. Didn't you hear this already? Can you tell me his name? How come I'm doing your job for you, Kate? His name is Nestor Chavez. Do you ever notice how it's the assholes in charge who always get away? That's off the record. Ready. You infiltrated their group, Fuentes. You knew all their plans. How did they expect to blow up the transmitter without any explosives? Without explosives? According to the district attorney's office. They weren't planning to blow up the tower. They were planning to sabotage it. It's a... It's a question of semantics. They had the guns, the matches, the fire starters. They were gonna burn down a metal tower? FUENTES: We weren't going to give them the opportunity. And nobody said they were intelligent. MAN: --in spite of our hard-working Latin American brother. And therefore, Puerto Rico must embrace the political and social aspirations of Latin America, like in Salvador...MAN: Come to the meeting. ...Cuba and Nicaragua. Ya viva Puerto Rico libre.CROWD: !¡Viva! !¡Ya viva la independencia de Puerto Rico! CROWD: !¡Viva! I'm Kate Meléndez, Channel 74 News. Yeah, I know. I'd like to talk to Mr. Chavez. I bet. You and everybody else in Puerto Rico. I'm sure you don't know where he is, but if you happen to come in contact with him... You are Juan Meléndez's widow? Yes. Okay. I'll find out if he wants to talk to you. MAN: Can I help you, miss? You have a reservation, right? Let's talk fast. You're the head of the A.R.M.? Hmph. What a joke. We didn't have a name. I saw it in the papers, I thought, "What the hell is that about?" Fuentes making himself look good. That's a real Fuentes touch. You wanna talk to the guy in charge? Talk to him. It was his plan. To sabotage the transmitter? Hmph. Sure. Except we were going to sabotage their minds. Constitution Day, right? We were going to seize the air waves and broadcast an Independentista communiqué to all of Puerto Rico. That's it? That was the whole idea? Your husband would have liked the timing. Great piece of propaganda, huh? Fuentes thought it was a little wimpy, not enough action. He was always promoting action. He's the one who got us the guns. He used to say that we were all show, no go. And you know what? They shouldn't have gone. Why didn't you go, Nestor? I'd stayed out too late the night before. MAN: Let's go, Chavez. You too, Meléndez. Let go of me! No! No! No! No! No! KATE: No! No! MAN: Kate Meléndez! Kate Meléndez! WOMAN: Is that the chick on Channel 74? WOMAN 2: It's not her. I need to call home. I have children. I have a right to a phone call. Is he dead? He may as well be. He's comatose. Are you gonna cry? I'm sorry too. I had my suspect if you hadn't interfered. I didn't interfere. You used me. Chavez knows a lot of information that I need. He was obviously afraid of how you were going to get it. Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. This isn't Chile. This isn't Cuba. We're Americans. We operate under the American law. So you gonna tell me the charges, then? Every citizen's duty is to support enforcement of the law. What are the charges against me? Because I've got two kids at home, and you have no right holding me here. I don't like you, either. You think you know what's going on. But you don't know a damn thing. You didn't have grounds for arrest, so resisting arrest-- Interfering with a lawful arrest, resisting arrest, assault on a police officer. So now you're gonna try and cut me a deal? Get her out of here. OFFICER: Sí, capitán. I have a... I got a big case coming up. Yeah. It's a... It involves a woman who was, uh... Said she was... COP: What do you know about that? COP: Yeah, that's what I said. But there's some problem with, uh, proving that it's, you know, a burden. COP: The woman's saying that there's foul play between her husband and the neighbor... I'm sorry, Daddy. The arrest report came across at the base. Mother wanted to invite you and the kids to dinner. You didn't tell her.I said you were busy. I guess that was the truth. You're supposed to be so damn smart. What were you doing in a nightclub with a Cuban terrorist almost getting yourself killed? He wasn't Cuban, he was Puerto Rican. Right. That makes sense now. Daddy.You should've said so. I was working on a story. The police set me up to find the guy for them. My big mistake. What a waste of money that was. I should never have sent you to college. This started there. I didn't call you to bail me out. Nice normal kid. I just wanted to get you out of Puerto Rico. You came back with a Puerto Rican. Daddy, don't get started. Please don't. Not just a Puerto Rican, a radical-left Puerto Rican. He was a lawyer with a cause, so-- Don't talk about him. Was that the attraction?I mean it! Mommy? Right here, baby. Where were you? You didn't call. I couldn't call. I didn't know where you were. I'm right here. Mrs. Meléndez. Teresa. TERESA: What brings you back here? Nestor Chavez. Is this for the news? I was with him when it happened. Oh. He's in Critical. TERESA: That's the family. Teresa, will you call me if there are any changes? I know it's against policy, but... Give me your number again. I remember how you called every day. Your husband was the favorite in the whole unit. I just wanted to ask about what happened. Go ask the police. Except they weren't in the car with you, Don Julio. I don't want to get into any more trouble. I've had enough trouble. See my cab? I can't even work with a cab like that. It doesn't pass regulation. Police shot up your car, they ought to pay for the damage. All I did was to pick up a fare, and look what happened to me. Every one of those boys had a gun. I wasn't going to argue. And they made you drive to Cerro Maravilla? Hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no. I'm just trying to explain to you. All right. All right. You guys go wait for me in the truck. So... you went up to Cerro Maravilla. That's my life savings. That car. Sorry. It's a nice car. Hmph, it used to be. I saw the police coming. I didn't know they were police. I just saw more guns. Then... I tried to get under the dashboard. I tried to hide. Chevys didn't have such a lot of sheet metal, I'd be dead myself. Then the police started shooting, that first time. I thought the whole car was gonna fall apart all around me. Well, did the police identify themselves or shout, "Halt," or anything like that? I couldn't see anything. I was hiding. I didn't see anything. W-well, did you hear anything before the police started shooting... that first time? I already told the police. Go. Ask the police. I just--I don't have to talk to you. No. You don't. Thanks anyway.I-I-I-- I haven't said anything, okay? I don't blame you. How do I look?You look great. I won't be late. There's only one band playing tonight. Have fun. We heard all the shooting. People started to get scared. Noise carries in the mountains. Everybody had just calmed down when it started again. You heard more gunshots? Not as many as the first time. You couldn't count those. The second time was a "bang-bang," and then "bang-bang." KATE: Don Jaime, how long was it between the two volleys of shots? I had time to finish my lunch. Ten minutes at least. KATE: Okay, that's it. What do the police say? That they must have heard hunters. Could've been. Could've been. You're gonna use this, aren't you? I mean, it's great stuff. And that's why I'm gonna use it. A blind man. You know your two pals, Professor Rey and the widow Ruiz? Together, they're suing the government for 2 and a half... mil. Good for them. I just got a tip that the grand jury's about to be convened. I don't air tips. I didn't ask you to, Howard. I'm just keeping you informed. Well, that's decent of you. Bye-bye. DON JAIME : We heard all the shooting. WOMAN: Julio, your food is getting cold. Everybody had just calmed down when it started again. You heard more gunshots? Not as many as the first time. The second time was a "bang-bang," and then "bang-bang." Don Jaime, how long was it between the two volleys of shots? I had time to finish my lunch. Ten minutes at least. For Channel 74 News, Kate Meléndez. Mommy's home! Pepita? What the hell are you doing in my house?! Hi, Kate. Nice place you got here. This is Lieutenant Fuentes. He's... the one that was on the television with you. Pepita, take them upstairs. Bye.FUENTES: Good night, Juanito. Sophie, sweet dreams, huh? I just wanted to talk to you, Kate. You wanna talk to me, we'll talk outside, not in my house. You're a very disturbed lady, Kate. I thought I could try to explain to you-- Hey, try. Listen to me. Ruiz and Rey were Communists. They were terrorists, and you're taking their side. Not if you're all telling the truth. We are supposed to stop Communism. We were doing our jobs. Fidel got the word. Now you're trying to make out like we were murderers. It was self-defense. Then there's nothing to worry about. Okay. Here's the headlines: "Cerro Maravilla is over and out." It's old news. Nobody cares. Forget about it. I told them that I would come to see you, Kate. Hey. It could've been somebody else, you know? How clear do you want me to make it? The police dragged me out of the car. I didn't know they were police right away. Nobody said so. He started hitting me with a rifle butt. He said he was going to shoot me to pieces, and, Mother of God, I believed him. He had me on the ground, like the other two muchachos. They were being kicked and hit worse than I was. Had they been shot already? Yes, but they were alive. Wait a minute. Are you saying--? That's what I'm trying to tell you. One of the boys said, "Don't hurt the old man. He isn't involved." So he stopped hitting me, and then they brought me over to a different tower. And that's where I heard the other shots. Well, why did you wait so long to talk? I was afraid. And the police said they would fix my taxi. KATE: They didn't? Cheap. Aren't you still afraid? Well, the blind man talked. And... three, two, one. Go.The federal grand jury, which has just been seated, must now decide whether or not the police action at Cerro Maravilla was an ambush that violated the civil rights of Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz. This is Kate Meléndez... GOVERNOR: Terrorists should know they'll be received as what they are: Enemies of the people of Puerto Rico. The police should be congratulated for this act of courage. This investigation and the grand jury will prove it. ANCHORMAN: Governor Villanueva went on to call for a... Why don't you look like that on air? Hmm? Because you didn't hire me for my looks. Well, they didn't hurt. God, a compliment. So... where you going? It's my birthday. My parents are taking me out. Hot date. Happy birthday, Meléndez. You're kidding me. Open it. God, it's beautiful. Did you pick this out? Put it in your bag, get out of here. Go have a happy birthday. Thank you, Howard. No! No! No! You got me in a lot of trouble, Kate. No. I'm not stupid. I didn't violate you, Kate. Actually, I'm a pretty nice guy when you're not around. You don't bring out my best side. That's the truth. And it's such a waste, Kate, because I'm gonna come out of this clean. Okay, sure, the grand jury's a big embarrassment, but... I'll figure that out. That's how it is. I like you, Kate. JUANITO & SOPHIE: Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Make a wish, Mommy. Make a wish. I'm sorry about the kids, honey. They were just dying to wake you up. I'm going to back off the story. End of problem. That's not like you, Kate. If you're right about what happened on the mountain, then the truth is bound to come out. Oh, Mom. No, I believe that. You're so American. You're such an optimist. You gotta base your life on positive values, baby. Now, we've always done that. Shit. ANCHORMAN: We interrupt this program for a special WPRN news bulletin. The U.S. Justice Department just sent home the grand jury, which has been hearing evidence in the Cerro Maravilla case. And so the investigation ends without an indictment. In Washington today, a spokesman for the Justice Department said, "The allegations were not supported by the evidence," which is welcome news to the police officers involved. Nestor Chavez, the student who was shot resisting arrest, died today. The police were unable to get a statement from him for the grand jury. This is Kate Meléndez for Channel 74 News. What are you doing here? You don't belong here. You killed him! You killed him! KATE : I-- I kept watching to see if anyone was following. I didn't see anybody. I led the cops straight to him. I mean, Chavez would be alive if he hadn't trusted me. Well, that's not necessarily true. I'm Juan Meléndez's widow. The movement's main lawyer. Juan would have known he was being followed. All right, Chavez went for the cop's gun. That was a decision, see? That's not your fault. No, but it wouldn't have happened. Somebody will break soon. I mean, too many people know about it. Well... not when Frank Curtin's a player, they won't. Frank? Yeah. Let me tell you something. Why do you think he was up at Cerro Maravilla? Damage control. Yeah, but how about damage? You mean Frank Curtin was involved in this? Well, he sure as hell wasn't just taking a walk in the woods. I'm not backing off the story, Howard. Because of Chavez? No. O-okay, yes! I mean, I don't give a shit it was an accident! Rey and Ruiz weren't... I mean, cops shouldn't get away with murder just because they're cops! Spare me the principles, please. Please. You're not listening. Now, what do they have to do? Kill you too? For you to get five minutes on the evening news? This isn't about the news, Howard! Nothing is worth dying for. Guarantee. Nothing! Nobody'd even remember you, kiddo. There'd be a long obituary and a short investigation. Now, your kids spend Sundays at the cemetery, and the lady selling flowers makes a little extra change. That's the only difference. The story goes away, in any case. Are you worrying about me, Howard... or Frank? I don't give a fuck about Frank Curtin! Except the guy's obviously... cutting his own story. And I don't wanna see anything else happen to you. I hired you, I trained you. Shit, I even like you. You're not gonna die while you're working for me. That's it. You're off the air. That's it! You're firing me?! No! I'm protecting you! Come on, Howard! And I shouldn't have told you about him, should I? I had the idea you were a rational person. Now, if you wanna work as a news writer, I'll hire you as associate producer. That's it. But you're taking away the mike. I-I'll jump stations. Do it. Fine. I'll give the eulogy. I still think you're looking out for him, Howard. To constitute a federal civil-rights offense, it has to be proven that the force used was excessive, deliberate and not the result of accident or mistake or negligence or reasonable responsive action. Now, especially since the federal grand jury-- That's a pretty piece of work, isn't it? They heard a lot of witnesses. They wanted to believe the cops. Maybe the cops were more believable. Except they had a reason to lie. The cab driver didn't. Neither did the blind man. You know about the bruises? They fell down an embankment when they were shot. I was up there. There's no embankment. So, what are you trying to tell me? That the police were hot-doggers who decided to save the public the cost of a trial? It's an election year. I think somebody decided to scare the voters into the governor's corner. He's big on law and order. Somebody like the FBI? You know Frank Curtin? Sure. I taped him up at Cerro Maravilla. I still have the outtakes. Okay, he was up there. So? You were too. Yeah, but you know him. I think he took a general directive to back the governor a little too literally. What would happen if an FBI agent is suspected of civil-rights violations? You know who investigates for my division? The FBI. I wanna jerk around, I'll stay at home, lady. Bye, sweetheart.Bye, Mom. Sophie! Where's my kiss? Thank you.Bye, Mom. Wanna get a cup of coffee or something? Man, I don't even wanna be on the same sidewalk with you. I was at Cerro Maravilla doing my job, you know? It went down, they called me. I work with the police. Now, you wanna know something about that, you could've come to me and asked me. You could've come to me. You should've come to me, Kate. I have to hear about it from some... goddamn internal memo from the Civil Rights Division? What were you doing? To listen to Ms. Foster, you implicated me in a criminal act. Would you please just listen to me? You don't get it, do you?! Maybe I do. An update on the election results. The latest precincts reporting in now show the opposition candidate leading over Villanueva by 9,000 votes. And with the polls closing in the next hour, we should be getting closer to a final result. In other local news, a fire-- Two milks, please. Coke for me. Two milks. What--? What happened? Looks like a power failure. Hmmm, this is kind of spooky. Mom? Hmm? Why does Grandpa say you're not Puerto Rican? I'm Puerto Rican by marriage. Your dad's family lives in New York now, but he was born in San Juan, just like you guys. Does that make us Puerto Rican? Sure you are. I'm American. No, you're not. You're not American. Because I'm white. Pepita said. Pepita made a mistake. You're American because every Puerto Rican is American. ANCHORMAN: And as the computers come back online, a surprising development has pushed Governor Villanueva ahead. And it seems only a matter of time before the opposition party concedes. Governor Villanueva's supporters are already beginning to celebrate at the city hall in Plaza de las Almas. Give me one!Give me one! All right! Hey, hey, guys. Look who's here.Where's Mommy? How you doing?Over there. ASENCIO: Hey.Hi. How are you? Surprise! How are you? How'd you like the blackout? Does it come any more convenient? They're not even waiting for the opposition to concede. Like he needs to. At least we're gonna have an opposition congress. Let's go. This is Lila Torres. I-- I'm Kate Meléndez. I know. I recognized you. Hi, Kate. Hi. Let's go.Bye, Kate. Bye. MAN: Which kind do you prefer? The $1,000 type or the $999 type... Mommy. BULLWINKLE: I'd like something right in the middle... It's good. Like it? BULLWINKLE: ...is bound to run into an occasional obstacle. MAN 2: Yes, sir? BULLWINKLE: I'd like a loan.MAN 3: Any collateral? Ah! Sophie, you watch cartoons or you do my hair. Okay, Mom. MAN 4: This is a stick-up! ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program for a special WPRN news bulletin. ANCHORWOMAN: The Puerto Rican Senate has passed a bill to open public hearingsStop. into the shooting deaths of the two alleged terrorists at Cerro Maravilla. A special prosecutor will be appointed as there was for the Watergate hearings in Washington. A comparison is being made in the halls of the Senate. Governor Villanueva immediately called the investigation a political witch hunt. I'm Lila Torres. This was a special newsbreak. ANNOUNCER: And now back to our regular program. BULLWINKLE: But, Your Highness, this is all a mistake. In his last nine appearances, Yabucoa's Julio Chumbo is 2-to-nothing, with two saves. In another game, Cataño's Marcos Rodriguez allowed only one double hit in the top of the ninth inning and obtained victory for his team over Vega Baja. This is Fernando Quinones for WSTR-TV, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Buenas noche. MAN: That's a wrap.MAN 2: Wanna kill the lights? How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. Please, come into my office. MAN 3: Okay, let's set up for... It's certainly been hot, hasn't it? Yes. Have a seat, please.Thank you. Oh, I'm Fernando Quinones, the station owner. Kate Meléndez. I was surprised to hear from you, Kate. I thought about calling you, but... I didn't think I had a chance. This is not, uh, Channel 74, you know. No, thanks. But I can make you an anchor. Which is more than Howard ever did. You can have my job. Well, actually, I-- I've got a programming idea. When do you wanna start? What about airing the Senate hearings? The Cerro Maravilla hearings? I could do the commentary. Huh. Wouldn't I love to, but, uh-- You don't run government ads. I've been watching. I'm practically on the subversive list right now. But I can't afford to cancel any of my regular programming. If you had a sponsor? Like the opposition party. KATE: We put together a budget to show you what it would cost to go live. The hearings will become a big media event, and you, the opposition party, will get the benefit of it. The thing with television is you get 100-percent saturation. You reach Puerto Rico. And you're never quoted out of context. MAN: Well, the numbers look good. What do you think? MAN 2: Looks fine to me. Kate... this is our special prosecutor, Luis Angel Mora. Kate Meléndez, now from WSTR. Channel 88.I'm still a fan. Luis, we have the opportunity of airing the hearings in their entirety. Stop.Live. Without commercials. I-it worked for Watergate. The hearings have a chance, don't they? Yes. But if the police version turns out to be true, we're going to have to endorse the Justice Department's investigation and close the case. But I will admit, in going over the reports, I found a lot of inconsistencies. Such as? Well, Alfredo Ruiz was killed with a shotgun, Jorge Rey with a .45. That's according to the autopsies. Now nobody seems to know where the guns are. Did you know that there was an FBI agent up there? Who? Frank Curtin. Frank Curtin was up there?Yep. Before or after? Well, he was there when I arrived, and they hadn't even loaded the bodies yet. Did you see the bodies?They were covered. Because either they were killed instantly, and that cab driver's lying, or he isn't. We'll soon find out. Excuse me if I seem a bit apprehensive, but I'm used to the rules of the court about publicity. I don't like arguing my case in the media. You're not. You're just getting the public into public hearings. I mean, how many people can you seat in a hearing room? You're as glib as a lawyer. Yeah, well, my husband was a lawyer. Juan Meléndez?Yes. Good attorney. I'm, uh... sorry. This is me.Yeah, uh, better go. Pleasure meeting you.And you. MAN: This is your seat, Professor Rey. Thank you. What's this about?ASENCIO: Hey. Job change.You guys quit? Yep. Coming out in 20 seconds.Good. I can't believe you're here. Three, two, one. Go. On July 25th, 1978, Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz were shot to death by the police in Cerro Maravilla. How and why are the questions before the Senate committee in these hearings. Were Rey and Ruiz Castro-backed terrorists caught in an act of sabotage who tried to shoot it out with the police and lost? Or were they Independentista students set up by an undercover agent and led into an ambush that was politically motivated? Was there a cover-up? And if there was, how high did it go? Are you ready, Mr. Prosecutor? Mr. Senate President, point of order. The chair recognizes the honorable Senator Balboa. I want to call a floor vote to end these proceedings on constitutional grounds. SENATE PRESIDENT: Noted and rejected. Call your witness, Mr. Prosecutor. I call Julio Dominguez. Don Julio. You told a reporter that Rey and Ruiz were wounded but alive when the shooting stopped. Yes, sir."Yes, sir." Well, I have a police report here stating that both men... were killed instantly. Not unless dead men talk. What is that? Not unless dead men talk. Get out. REY: Hey, don't hurt the old man! He's not involved! Shut up! BALBOA: This is the first time we've heard about this finger. It's not in your statement, Mr. Dominguez. Even when you changed your statement for the press, you didn't mention your finger. SENATE PRESIDENT: Senator, would you lower your voice, please? You're berating the witness. BALBOA: Which finger did you say was injured? Was it this finger? What about this finger?! SENATE PRESIDENT: Senator! BALBOA: You are the number one liar. I am telling the truth. BALBOA: Which finger? You think he's telling the truth? Sí, sí. I have no further questions. SENATE PRESIDENT: You're excused, Mr. Dominguez. These hearings are adjourned until tomorrow. MORA: Dr. Salazar. How many autopsies would you say you've performed in your career? An estimate. SALAZAR: More than 17,000. 17,000. Two of which were the autopsies for the police on Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz. Correct. Doctor, what would you say was the cause of death? Multiple gunshot wounds. Multiple gunshot wounds. Were there any other signs of trauma? No, sir. Excuse me? What? I found no other antemortem trauma. You found no cuts, no lacerations, no bruises, no abrasions? Mr. Senate President, the prosecutor is leading his own witness. I withdraw the question. Doctor... let me refresh your memory. Get the shot. Is it true or no that these injuries are signs of trauma? I said I found no antemortem trauma other than the round, penetrating wounds, "antemortem" meaning "beforedeath." Oh, I think I understand the word, doctor. The postmortem injuries are consistent with the bodies falling down an embankment, as the police described! Why did you join the Armed Revolutionary Movement? I was never an Independentista. I was an informer and, after that, an agent for the police. MORA: So you were assigned to infiltrate the group. I was told to find a terrorist group, and I did. By whom? By whom? Who told you? I'm not sure now. It's-- It's been a long time. MORA: You're not sure. Did you ever work for the FBI? BALBOA: Mr. Prosecutor, what's the object of this line of questioning? MORA: Senator, I'm trying to establish whether or not the police were acting alone. This is pure hysteria. The FBI is an unimpeachable federal institution. Mr. Senate President, I ask for a vote of censure. Overruled. MORA: Thank you, Mr. President. Is it true or no, did you ever work for the FBI? No. I work for the police. You work for the police. So you set up Rey and Ruiz for the police. You're trying to entrap me. No, that was your job, son. Didn't you buy the guns for Alfredo Ruiz and Jorge Rey? Everything I ever did was out of patriotism. I am an American, and I love my country. Answer the question. Is it true or no? Sometimes, you have to bend things a little to protect the public and-- And the national security. I have a purchase receipt here for those guns made out to your name. Could you answer the question? Is it true or no? It's a simple question, answer it. Is it true or no? You're the one feeding him that crap about the FBI. Let go. You should be careful, Kate. Who did you think I was working for? You're never gonna nail Frank. He's too smart. If he were real smart, we wouldn't be standing here in the Senate. Nice suit. MORA: Dr. Martin. You're a professor of forensic science at Texas A&M University.That's correct. And you're a specialist in gunshot wounds. I've just published a book on that subject. Now, you've had a chance to examine the autopsy reports and the clothing of the deceased. That's correct. Can you summarize your conclusions? MARTIN: Mr. Ruiz was killed by a shotgun used at a distance of no more than 4 feet while he was... kneeling on both knees. The clothes were soaked with massive amounts of blood from the chest down to the knees, but no blood below that. The person who fired must have been standing over the deceased because of the downward trajectory of the pellets. Doctor, the police report states that they were firing from a prone position. No, I'm sorry, that's-- That's just not physically possible. KATE: Apparently, the evidence just given by the American professor of forensic science, Dr. Martin, has angered some senators of the investigating committee. It seems to be the same group of senators who have opposed these hearings from the beginning. Excuse the interruptions, doctor. What about Jorge Rey? Mr. Rey was struck by four shots from a revolver. The first one broke the right femur just below the hip, causing him to fall to the right. The second struck the left kneecap. A third entered his chest. And a fourth penetrated his heart. I have no further questions. I am very, very surprised. If the witness is not mistaken, then I have been deceived by the police the same way the grand jury and the Justice Department were. ANCHORMAN: Moving to international news, demonstrations continued today against the shah of Iran. Thousands of people flood the streets of Tehran... ...calling for an end to the shah's rule. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the shah denied reports that members of the government were transferring assets out of the country as the political stability has forced them to. Also in international news... I'm Nelson Machado. I'm the cop who hit the cab driver. Jesus, he looked like he was part of it. How was I supposed to know? I didn't think I hit him that hard. He can identify me. You've got a problem. Can I come in? I don't think so. You're the only person that I can talk to that I know won't talk to the department. I didn't kill anybody. If I can get immunity... Officer Machado, is it true or no that you lied to the grand jury? He's lying right this minute. I was thinking of my friends. So yes, you did lie. They were involved by accident. One of them is my brother-in-law. They're not evil. These are agents who served the police of Puerto Rico well over the years. I was just thinking of my friends. They're not responsible for what happened. And what did happen? Everybody was firing. Fuentes got... shot up. !¡Basta! !Basta! MACHADO: I thought we'd killed him. Rey and Ruiz threw their guns out. I went over to them. And Ruiz, he started to say how he wanted to work for us. I could infiltrate-- Ah! He said, "I can be an agent for the police." This isn't testimony, it's a performance. The man has been coached. Aren't you trying to save yourself from a perjury charge, officer? You're earning your immunity, aren't--? Senator! MACHADO: The both of them never even fired their guns. We did that afterwards... for the ballistics tests. So the story would hold up. Somebody gave the order to fire. Who gave the order? Who gave the order to fire? I don't know. I don't know who gave the order. I'm an agent! Don't shoot me! I'm an agent! Don't-- FUENTES: You shot me! You shot me. MAN: What about the other guy?RUIZ: I surrender. I surrender. I surrender!You, get up. Get up! Get over here. !¡Basta! !Basta! Get out. Get out. Get out! Oh, my God. Don't kill me, please. I'm a victim. Oh, my... Hey, don't hurt the old man! He's not involved! Oh... MAN: Come on.MAN 2: Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, come on, man. Give me a chance. I could work for you guys. I could be an agent. I could do anything-- Ah! N-- Noooo! No! No! Do it, man. Hey, you all knew the plan. Don't torture me! Just sh-shoot me in the head! Well, you wanted a couple of terrorists, there they are. MORA: Who gave the order to fire? I don't know. Who are you looking at?! I don't know. It was too confusing. Who gave the order to fire?! I don't know. Who gave the order to fire?!I don't know! Who gave the order to fire? I don't know!You do! Point him out! I have no further questions. KATE: The truth about Cerro Maravilla is now public record. Why is not. The Senate ends its hearings without discovering who ordered the deaths of Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz. Who knew? Did the Justice Department and the FBI conspire with the police, at least in the cover-up? How high did it go? The investigation now moves from the Senate to the courts and continues there. This is Kate Meléndez, WSTR, Channel 88. Whoo! Let's wrap it up. MAN: Snow cones, we got all flavors. Snow cones. Scare you? I didn't see you. Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, Kate, you never really should have. Late for that now. MAN: Snow cones, snow cones. Go get your snow cones. Snow cones. We got all flavors. Snow cones. Snow cones, everybody. Snow cones, snow cones. Snow cones, snow cones. Go get your snow cones. Snow cones. We got all flavors. Snow cones. Snow cones. Snow cones, everybody. Snow cones. We got all flavors. Come get your snow cones. Do you have something against me personally? I just think you got your hands dirty this time, Frank. It was a beautiful operation. But the whole thing fell apart. Not my fault. It's hard to find good help these days, you know? KATE: That's a problem. If you just left the whole thing alone, I could've kept a lid on it. But you had to go and make a fucking career out of it. After a long parade of witnesses and thousands of pages of testimony-- Just one moment. We have more coming in live from the field. I didn't know it was your plan, Frank. Well, who the hell else had the capability, huh? I don't know. I figured the police. Broke like bread sticks, didn't they? I made them into heroes. Shit. You know how tough it is to produce a genuine terrorist on this island? Those two suckers were a gift from heaven. Except they weren't terrorists, Frank. I wish they had been, but sometimes you just have to make do. At least they had the right spirit, though, didn't they? Fuentes didn't have to tie the guns into their hands, did he? Okay, but why'd you have to murder them? You really are a dumb bitch, you know that? They'd have done a year on kidnapping and been out. I needed an event. I had a directive. To get the governor re-elected? The man's a damn good anti-Communist. I sure as hell wanted him re-elected. It's in America's interests. I knew how to get results. Nobody had to tell me what was necessary. You think I'm somebody's boy? I fly solo. Yeah, but then you don't have any protection, Frank. Nobody's gonna look out for you. Well, it's not too late for a little damage control right here. You'll end up hanging out to dry on an indictment. Shit. I got too big a mouth. Now I'm really gonna have to do something about you, Kate. It's not gonna happen. Trust me. You're dead. And you're live.
