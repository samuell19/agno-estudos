Translation: Serveladkin. THE DEVIL'S BATTLE MOBILE All Heathville loved Paul Carraters, his kind rural doctor. Nobody suspected that in his home laboratory on the slope. The hill overlooking the magnificent Martin Heath mansion .. The doctor found time to conduct some secret experiments - Strange, terrifying experiments. Ah, my friend .. Our theory of glandular stimulation .. With the help of electrical impulses was true! A couple of days ago you were small, like your kindred. And now - just look at yourself! Hello? Says Dr. Carruthers. This is Heath. Today, Henry Morton and I are having a small party at my house. We want you to come. You are very kind. I am very grateful to you. But I'm very busy, working on the formula for a new after shave lotion. Oh, doc, this is my daughter's idea. She is very disappointed if you do not come. Refuse do not accept. Make him come. You see, there's something like a special occasion here .. Ready to argue - Mary is going to announce her engagement .. With this young shot, Don Morton. Tell her I'll come. Bye. Well, everything is arranged, he will come. He will be surprised to learn that a special occasion. This is giving him this check with a bonus. Five thousand dollars .. Good. You did not forget. You hate this strange eastern flavor, even in a dream. Just as I hated him before I made you big and strong. Now, if you find this fragrance in the night, when you are awake .. You will attack! Yes, you will attack .. to kill! The dock is delayed. He must have been called to the patient. I'll phone him .. Roy, Tommy, do not forget .. You do not have to say anything to the doctor about this check until your father gets it. And you warned those two doves? Probably better to warn. "I want to warn both of you." "Do not say a word about the check." While you yourself do not spoil them. His father will show it to you, Mary. Why do not you arrange a grand opening, like for a statue? Then we could all be there. You know, I think it would be better to seal the check in a bottle and run it to him. It must have come to you from the bottle. "Well, that does not come." "What a nuisance!" He was too carried away by this new formula and completely forgot about us. He would forget about the formula if he found out about the check for 5 thousand dollars. Why do not we go to him and give him a check? Oh no, I would not do that. He does not like guests who come when he experiments. - Roy can take him a check. - Of course, I could. Should I make a speech when I hand it over? No, actually, the check itself speaks for itself. Yes, and says a lot. Sonny, tell us that we are very sorry that he could not come. Of course, we understand how busy he is. Good. Just a minute, Roy, now I'm free. All is ready. So, what can I do for you? We are all very sorry that you could not come today. Yes, but, you see, I'm busy. "Something important, very important." Oh sure. Mr. Morton and my father prepared a little surprise for you. Surprise? "He's right here." "Well, let's see what it is." Five thousand dollars .. What is it for? Just a small sign of friendship. Oh, I understand. Bonus. Well, that's very kind of you from your father and Mr. Morton. "Tomorrow I will thank them in person." "I'll tell them, Doctor." And you are not interested in my new formula? Of course, interesting, but I did not want to seem curious. - What is it? - A new after shave lotion. Smell it. "A pretty strong smell, is not it?" No no.. The odor will erode shortly after use. Try a few drops. Now rub it in the soft tissues of your neck. Softens, does not it? Yes.. When will it be ready for sale? Oh, he's still in the experimental stage. I first want to test it on several people .. And see if it works. If you want, send me a bottle, I will gladly test it for you. Thank you. Good night, doctor. Goodbye, Roy .. Nice check, is not it, doctor? They are rich - at your expense. You made them rich, doctor. It was your formula! Today they gave you five thousand dollars .. And wanted you to come to their home and thanked them for it. It was your money, what they gave you .. As if throwing the ball obedient dog. You must be very grateful, doctor, very grateful. Thanks to you they are rich and happy. And what did you get, doctor? You have to work hard this night! It's time for you to go! But Mary, now that our families are here - It's time to announce the engagement! Listen, Don, I've loved you for a long time, ever since we were kids .. But I'm afraid, more like a sister. Well, I... I did not think it was that way .. Something happened to Roy! Roy! "I'll call Dr. Carruthers!" Faster please! I can not help you. "Do you want to say that he's dead?" Yes. I'll call the coroner. "Do you think this is a murder?" I do not know. I've never seen this before. His jugular vein is torn. Call Johnny Leighton to me! Well, what have I done now? Who wants to fire me now? Nobody, for now. But the day has just begun. It came from Heathville. Mysterious murder. The son of the old Martin Heath. - Who is Martin Heath? - Who is Martin Heath? Tell me, did you ever go on a date with a girl? With a girl? Oh yeah, with the girl .. It seems that one day I was walking with a girl. "Well, did you smell good from her?" Yes. Of course, it smelled good. As with most girls. This is because of the limited series of cosmetics Martin Heath. He does all this stuff that women put on their faces, when they do not want to wash themselves with water and soap! Ah, I understand, he's a big man, right? Yes, and a great supplier of advertisements. Take the photographer and drive to Heightsville! The coroner is conducting an investigation. Find who actually killed the son of old man Heath! OK, McGuinty, I'm on my way! "Chief Wilkins?" - Yeah. I'm Johnny Leighton from the Chicago Registrar. Nice to meet you. And this is my photographer, Shooter McGuire. "Hello, Chief." - Hi. Look, we're here about Heath's murder, but from the coroner's investigation we did not get much information. I thought - maybe you can help us? Well, I'm always ready to cooperate with newspapers, provided that they will cooperate with me. This is the policy of my newspaper. I'll tell you the truth - I myself did not understand this too. Here's something that might interest you - it's a snapshot of the victim's wounds. With this glass you can see better. Are there scratches on the neck and shoulders? Yes, but we can not determine what they did. For the nails are too deep, and for the knife - too superficial. More like claws. The same thing was said by Dr. Carruthers during the inquiry. Wild animal? Is there a circus lately? No. And there was no escape of animals from the zoo? No. Or maybe this is one of those African leopard people? "They use steel claws." "This is not Africa." OK, chief, I was just trying to help. Chief, you do not exactly hold any clues found during the investigation? Well, since you're going to work with me on this case .. There is a clue. But very strange. The pathologist said that such wounds could have been inflicted .. Claws of a large bird. Birds? But in the district there are no birds large enough to attack a man. How about an eagle? "But we know that it was not a bird." How do you know? Because we found a few hairs on the shoulders of Heath's cloak. Ah, Sherche la fem! "This is not human hair." "And whose?" Well, it may seem stupid, but laboratory tests showed that they belonged to a mouse. But who and when heard about the mouse, so big to kill a person? Listen, in bats, wool is like a mouse .. The only bats that are found here are no more than a sparrow. From the wounds came a strange smell, but he was so weak and elusive .. That the police chemist could not identify him. There is already something to work on. Well, the smell could be evidence, but it's destroyed - it evaporated. Listen, Chief, do you mind if I make myself something up here? Of course not, roll. And if I can help... You can. It seems that Miss Heath was nearest to the murder scene. I'd like to talk to her. Can you arrange this? I think I can. Dr. Carraters refused to talk to us. We tried this morning during the investigation .. Do not worry about Dr. Carruthers. He's one of the best people in Heathville. He just thought you were interested in the tragedy of Mary, to print a sensational article. I will arrange an interview. Thank you, chief, I'll be in touch with you. Good. 4-8-J. Miss Heath, do you know if your brother had enemies? No, everyone in the village loved Roy. And what did he do in the factory? He was the head of the research bureau, developing new products. And here is Dr. Carruthers. Hello, Doctor. "Hello, Mary." I walked from my lab a short way through the garden. You met Dr. Carruthers this morning at the inquest. Yes. Mr. Leighton, I hope you will forgive me if I seemed slightly rude. But I love Mary, and mindful of the test, through which she already had to go through .. I wanted to protect her from a too long experience of this tragedy. Of course, you were right. Now we are working on this matter together with the police. Yes, I understand, Chief Wilkins told me. If there is anything I can do to help, just give me a call. Thank you. "You will not sit down?" "Shall I serve dessert?" No, Maxine, I myself. You can go. "Ui, mademoiselle." "The Sahara, Mr. McGuire?" "Oh, no, ma'am, for nothing. Actually, I do not even need tea. If I may be absent, I'll look around. Perhaps I'll find a clue. Mr. Leighton, how do you like the theory of Dr. Carruthers about a wild animal? Frankly, I do not think so. I would not blame you for that. I, as a scientist, consider many things from those, what a simple man could not overlook. For example? The ragged edge of the wound, The speed with which the killer disappeared, scratches from the claws of a hare or beast .. When an animal attacks a person - there must be a lot of noise. You heard the testimony of Miss Hit - there were no sounds of struggle. No.. Only these terrible cries. All this is very mysterious, very mysterious .. Doctor, when you last saw Roy - did he look worried, nervous or gloomy? No, not at all, on the contrary - he was in a great mood. Well, it's time for me to go back to the village and start writing an article. With your permission.. If you find it necessary to talk again - you can come at any time. Tonight, if you do not mind. I would like to stay here for a while. - Yes, I do not mind. - Thank you. "Good-bye, Miss Heath." Bye. "Goodbye, doctor." "A little more chiffon, baby." But I do not understand.. Oh, you know what I'm talking about - a little more stockings. - Like this? Like? - Of course! And who would not like it? And now - do not move. It will take a little time .. Got to shoot - shoot! Now, Johnny, I'm just trying to focus. Done, and - not bad! I'll be back in a minute, Frenchcoats, and do not worry about these werewolves, because when I'm around - nobody will hurt you! You helped Maxine feel so calm .. My big brave journalist! In my understanding this is called - sit back. Sit here and wait for the animal to help us write the article. Just look at this moon! And I had a date with a French jacket .. Yes, enough to complain. We are supposed to solve the murder! You, the "big brave journalist". For the first time I was invited somewhere. And ask not to shave until I go there. I would like to watch your reaction when you experience lotion. Now understand.. I want the lotion to be perfect before you transfer it to you for sale. Here .. Slightly harsh .. But customers will decide that they are paying for it! Oh, how nice! Very soothing. I do not think that you will ever use something else. Well, we do not sell goods that we would not use ourselves. It smells so good that it can practically be used instead of cologne! Oh, what's up, doc? Do not like your own lotion? I have a terrible dislike for perfume. Oh, I'm sorry. Nothing, Tommy. "Good night, doc." Goodbye, Tommy .. Hey.. What is it? "Where?" There, something is moving .. Get out of there, whoever you are! What are you doing here, Miss Heath? I thought that you would not be harmed by the company. Maybe we should sit down? You know, after what happened, you should not be wandering around the garden at night. - Yes, and you, too .. - Well, my job is this. Me too. Roy was my brother. Careful, in my opinion, it's Tommy! - Hey, Tommy. - Hello. - Hey, Tommy. How are you, sis? Mr. Layton wanted to sit in the garden for a while, and I joined him. Do not tell me that you are waiting for this animal, about which Dr. Carraters spoke. "So you do not believe that either?" Of course not. What an absurdity. Someone or something killed your brother. And, I believe, you are practicing theory, on which the murderer always returns to the crime scene? Maybe. This is not for me. Listen to my advice, Mary - leave these gentlemen to guard, and go to bed yourself. Personally, I'll do it. Goodnight. Good night, Tommy. I do not think your brother likes my presence here. Do not pay attention to Tommy. We are all terribly annoyed. I know. Help! "Tommy!" - Faster! For help! But I'm telling you, McGuinty - it was a bat! I saw how she killed Tommy Heath! Listen, Johnny, I want you and Shooter back home. Or I'll fire you both! I'm not going back, and Shooter, too. He will stay here to take a picture of this diabolical bat. Listen, great will be the headline - "The devil bat attacks again." Listen, do not tell me this nonsense. Maybe for you to send a van with bars on the windows .. And with strong guys with straitjackets? Listen, Joe, did I ever lie to you? Many times. But this time I'm not lying! If it becomes known that I invented this story about the devil's bat I can not get a job even in a rural weekly! Print the article, Joe. God swear, it's all true! Okay, I'll type it. But I do not believe in it, until the Shooter takes a picture of this diabolical bat in flight! Do not worry, he will make it. Bye. You, my friend, will take a picture of a diabolical bat in flight. Who am I? How? Have you not noticed that there is a workshop of a stuffed animal in the village? You're not suggesting I go there and stuff a stuffed bird, right? Shooter, how could you think what I'm offering you .. To persuade the village jelly. To make you a pretty big bat for a picture? In addition, the bat - it's not a bird, it's an animal! And what did not you just say? Where is this bird feller? Ah, the manager of the cottage! A mysterious diabolical bat killed Thomas Heath! Flying death strikes another blow at Hithville. The villagers live in fear of the diabolical bat. Thomas Heath fell victim to the monster. Who will be the next victim of the diabolical bat? The villagers tremble with terror in front of the killer. Aftershave. Experimental. The devil bat attacks again. A winged monster kills a new victim in Hatville. That's the idea, Frenchies - you keep the bat while I'm cooking the camera. When I raise my hand, you will push the bat well - and she rushes, as if in flight. And I'll have a great shot for the boss, okay? Ui. I'm smart, are not I? No. But hold the bat until I raise my hand. Cher, are not you hurt? What did it take you to break my devil's bat? I'll make you pay for it! And I'll put you in jail until you explain it! Come on! "You can not do this to me!" "But I do, do not I?" We just did a little experiment, trying to understand how the devil bat is committing murders. I'm sure that McGuire was not going to do anything wrong. He's just too fanatical in his work. Yes, but the whole city is on ears. And everyone with horror thinks, whether he will become the next victim. I do not need unnecessary problems, even with an artificial bat. You'd better go back to the hotel. I want to talk to the chief privately. "Can I go, Chief?" "Yes, but be careful from now on." Have you ever met a similar smell? Yes! It's the same substance that was on all the victims of the devil's bat! "Where did you get it?" Found in the bathroom of Don Morton. Find out where Morton got it? No, I did not raise suspicion with unnecessary questions, until this piece is analyzed. Do you think this has anything to do with the murders? It occurred to me, but I could not figure out which. I immediately call a police chemist. I'm poking around, maybe I'll find out where he's from Morton. Perhaps, from the cosmetic factory Hit. My people are working on a hypothesis, that the crimes committed by an angry employee of the factory. Certainly, it is not a coincidence that, that all the victims were members of the Morton and Heath families. Yes .. It seems like a conspiracy to destroy them all. I would like the remaining of them to leave the city .. Until the crime is solved. You're worried about Mary, are not you? Yes, I insisted that she leave, but she will not go without her father. And he persistently wants to stay here and help with the disclosure of the crime. And worse, neither Heath nor Morton .. Did not allow me to send them bodyguards. I guess we'll have to wait until something happens. "Good night, Chief." "Good night, Johnny." Boy, I have a picture that will dump McGuinty dead. Meet the devil bat! And what about this wire? It looks like a bat on a trapeze. I have not worked on it yet. When I'm done with it, this bat will look like this, There is nothing around her except for nothing. OK, Rembrandt, you won. Says your radio commentator Walter King. Today we are reporting from a small village of Hittsville, Where are the victims of the supposedly devilish bat .. For the last six months there were three people. You noticed, I said "supposedly diabolical bat". This, ladies and gentlemen, because your correspondent is very skeptical .. Refers to the possibility of the existence of this monstrous creation. Today I have a guest in my studio - Professor Percival Garland Raines, Perhaps the world's best specialist in the animal world. I'll take Professor Raines's interview on an infernal bat. Our audience can draw their own conclusions. Professor Raines, first let me ask you a direct question - Do you believe in the existence of a creature like a diabolical bat? I do not believe. "He's an insolent fellow!" This! In the forgotten centuries, when men and women lived in caves .. There could be bats of this size. But not in our days, not in this century. How would you comment on the fact that Mary Heath, two of whose brothers were victims of the diabolical bat, and reporter John Layton claim to have seen this incredible creature? Sometimes, under the influence of experiences, our brain can play a joke with us. Hey, does he mean you saw a little bat? Shut up. And what about the photograph of the devil's bat, published in the newspaper of Mr. Leighton? I studied this picture under a strong magnifying glass. I declare that this is a fake. Whoever created this strange monster - he forgot to cut the label from silk. From the silk used for the left wing. The label says "Made in Japan". Order an urgent call to Heathville. I want to talk to Johnny Leighton! He lives in a hotel in Hithville. - One attempt - who could it be? - Yes, MwkGinty. Come on, get out. So you slipped me a fake shot, huh? You're fired, both of you! And I'll make sure that you can not get into any newspaper while I'm alive! "Made in Japan".. And tell Strelka McGuire that he will have to take pictures in the madhouse! Come back here both and get your calculation! Oh no, we will not come and we will not get anything. Well, we're fired - but still remain here. I saw this bat! We stay here to catch this mouse, and when we catch it - I'll bring her and shove you in the throat! Bye! "Well, we're fired." Yeah, again. Now he calls to apologize. Scare him right! There's no point begging us to work for you again, McGeady. You fired us - so be it! Oh, Mary .. I thought it was someone else. Johnny, why did you turn such a tragedy into a joke? Mary, I was not going to turn anything into a joke! I was just trying to make an article! I suppose "making an article for you means" publishing a fake picture". This is a deliberate deception! Now the whole district laughs! Great job, Johnny, but, strangely enough, I did not appreciate it. "But I can explain this picture!" "And do not try, Johnny." "Made in Japan".. I'll take off your living hide and slay her to the barn door! This is a chemical analysis of that shaving lotion. I see you could not identify one of the ingredients. Yes, the chemist said that perhaps it is an element with which he is not yet familiar. We will not go anywhere until we identify him. In this city there is only one person who could help us. Dr. Carruthers. Yes, Carrateres could help us. I found out that it was he who created the lotion. If you suspect Carraters - you're barking out the wrong tree, Johnny. He is the last person in this city who would harm someone. That's why everyone loves him. Maybe.. But here's what I've dug up. Heath and Morton made states on the formula of a non-soiling cream, developed by Dr. Carraters. So what? All that the doctor got for this was $ 10,000, and others made a fortune. Well, everyone knows that he chose money, although he could become a partner of the firm. However, on each victim there was this substance from his laboratory. Johnny, maybe you're working too hard on this thing? Well, I just want to see his reaction to this. If he denies that he knows something. Then it is somehow connected. I think you're crazy. Just to show you that I'm checking all the options - We'll talk to him. Pour it into another bottle and do not say that we would know that he created it. And ask him to analyze it. Doctor, I hope we did not interfere with your work here so bursting into you? Oh no, not at all! I can not wait to help solve these crimes. All the victims were my close friends. Here is a sample of the substance that was on the younger Morton and the two sons of Heath, When they attacked the devil's bat. Of course, I do not understand why a bird should attack only people, using this particular substance. The bat is not a bird, it's a mammal. Whatever the case, our police chemist could not identify one of the ingredients. We thought - suddenly you can. And how! I created it myself. This is a new shaving lotion, with which I experimented. An ingredient that your chemist could not identify, I discovered many years ago in Tibet. And why did you decide to use it in shaving lotion? Lamas used it in one of their religious rituals as an incense. The smell is very pleasant and competitors can not imitate it. But why would Morton and the two sons of Heath use it? Oh, this is the policy of our firm - experience any new product before you put it on sale. Well, that cut down our theory in the bud. Yes.. We hoped that an unknown ingredient might prove to be a clue. This is not the bottle I poured it into. But I suppose your chemist poured it when he did the analysis. Yes. Can I help you with anything else? "Tell me, did you hear Professor Raines on the radio last night?" Yes, it was very interesting and exciting. Do you mean you believe that the devil bat exists? Why not? You saw her, did not you? "Of course I did!" And Mary saw! Then why worry about what one scientist is saying? Because of this one scientist I was fired. You mean your newspaper threw you out? - And there is. - What a pity.. So you will leave when this mystery is not yet revealed? I'm afraid not. I'm going to stay here and work with the boss. If you're going to stay here... I would like you to experience a new lotion and say if you like it. "And you, too, chief." "No, no, it's not me, Doc. If my wife smells on me perfume - she will start to suspect me. Well, Mr. Leighton, I understand that you are not married .. Well, I'll test it in the morning when I shave. "I think we should go, Chief?" "See you later, doc." "For now, Dr. Carruthers." "Good-bye, Mr. Leighton." What's the matter, what's the matter? This smelly shaving lotion plunged you into a dream? Why did you tell Dook that you use it if you think it's stinky? I do not know, probably, I was ashamed for the fact that I suspected the old dock. Well, I like him, I'll tell him so. What time is it now? "It's past midnight." "Midnight!" There's no point in waiting here longer. It must have been a night out for the bats. - You heard? - Yes! Prepare the camera! Bend down! You did it! Listen, Johnny .. I'll make this bird for McGinnie, and I'll feed him myself! The reporter killed the diabolical bat! The monster is shot. The end of the mouse power of terror. The reporter killed a bat looking for a victim. Scientists are surprised at a huge bat. It is believed that this creature - the last of its kind. I was still skeptical when I arrived in Heathville today, To investigate the body of the so-called diabolical bat. But after I saw her personally and carefully studied .. I came to the conclusion that this creature. Relic of the species of giant bats, which in huge numbers existed in the early Neolithic period. Maybe I should explain to some of our listeners .. That the Neolithic Age is a period commonly called the Stone Age. Imbecil. Pompous ignoramus! I'm sorry, McGuinty, but we and Shooter are not interested .. in your pricing. - Of course, if you add twenty .. - Thirty! Tree dollars plus a good bonus - we could think. You are extortionists! I will not allow to be robbed! As you wish, McGuinty, whatever you like, but .. we have a mouse corpus delicti and photos are a real bomb! Of course, I have an eyewitness account, which is already waiting for two syndicates. And do not forget - you have to pay us for the time that we were fired! That's better. Well said, boss! OK, we're working for you again. We will finish something and in a couple of days we will arrive. Bye. Sign in. - Hello, Johnny .. - Mary! Johnny .. I came to say that I regret what I said last time. You think .. I do not know how to say it .. Of course. Miss Heath, do you think - the Frenchwoman will apologize to me if I visit her? I'm sure! Wonderful! You will be even more than your unhappy predecessor. You're furious, are not you? Excellent! I'm also furious. Today I'll call Henry Morton - and you will destroy it! Henry, the lotion was even better than I had hoped. I want you to experience it. Leave it here, doc, I'll try it tomorrow when I shave. It smells good, does not it? Yes, but is it not too strong? No, no, evaporation will quickly bring it to the desired level of smell. Spread a few drops on your face .. I'd rather wait to shave. Then my skin will be more tender and receptive to the lotion. Well, a little bit, here .. The skin here is always very gentle .. I'll drop a little on your arm. I hope you are right, and the smell will quickly erode. I smell all the way to heaven. Perhaps this will be the secret of his success. In this business you never know what can happen. Can you believe me, Henry - you do not have to worry. Yes, I can believe that, doc. All your formulas are very successful. I looked through the company's annual profit reports. The income was a million dollars. Not bad, eh? Do you remember where we started? With the unfortunate ten thousand dollars for your formula. You should not have taken all the cash, Doc. If you decided to join us, you would also be rich. Although, perhaps, you are more interesting in your laboratory, with your experiments. To invent something new .. You're a dreamer, doc. Dreamers are harmful to have a lot of money. Therefore, you try to pay me flattery, telling me that I am a dreamer. Well, I really dream .. And you will never guess - about what. I'm afraid you got nervous, doc. Calm down, pull yourself together. You worked too hard on your formula. Formula.. For a great scientist, it's like a child's play. Your brain is too weak to understand what I achieved in the world of science! Doc, you've made some great scientific discovery. What kind? Henry, when you learn it - it will be too late for you. Come on, Doc, come on. You can not pretend that you control the fate of a person. I have already proved this three times. I apologize. Perhaps you are right, Henry, about the fact that I overworked. I think I'm a little tired. I'll go home and rest a bit. Of course. Sleep will do you good. Good night, doc. Goodbye, Henry. 36 J Hello? "Is that you, Martin?" Yes, Henry. I want you to ask Chief of Police Wilkins to come to you immediately. - It is very important! - The boss now has me. Do not let him go until I come. And what happened? I think I found out who committed all these murders. Maybe I'm wrong.. But if my suspicions are at least half true, then this is the most diabolical plan ever invented by man. What's the plan? Speaking of the scattered professors - I forgot my hat. Henry, what are you talking about? I'll tell you everything when I come to you. I hope I did not interrupt the personal conversation? No, nothing important. I hope Henry was right about his suspicion. But why did not he tell me more on the phone? When I began to insist on this - he changed his tone, as if interrupted. I'm afraid that someone could hear him. "What is this scream?" "Ah, just one of the nocturnal sounds." Help! The partner of the devilish bat kills Henry Morton. The second flying monster kills the resident of Heathville. The village is horrified by the appearance of a new bat. Henry Morton - the fourth victim of the devil's bat. Horror resumes after a new monster attack. Mr. Heath, it became much easier for me when you asked me to live with you don't kill this new diabolical bat. I'm worried about Mary. What prompted you to think that Mary was in danger? Only the next .. I'm convinced that someone is using this bat, To completely destroy the families of Hits and Mortons. As a scientist, I can assure you that the thought of a man controlling a bat. The idea that a person controls a bat is fantastic. Be that as it may, no villager was killed or even attacked. You forget that Mr. McGuire was attacked, and he does not belong to any of this family. Well, I'm already practically a member of this family. I'm going to marry Miss Mary's maid. Really? Well, boys, I'll tell Maxine to escort you to your rooms. - Thank you. - And I'll go home. It's high time for me to sleep. Good night, gentlemen. "Good night, Martin." "Good night, doc." "Good night, doctor." Good-bye, Mary. Come again. "Maxine?" "Uwe, mademoiselle?" You poured me something new in the perfume bottle? Oh no, mademoiselle, I never touch your perfume. Strange, I do not recognize him .. Probably, my father poured, as a surprise. He always does this with all the new spirits that he plans to release. Anything else? "No, Maxine, that's all." Goodnight. "Good night, mademoiselle." Mary, what happened? She tried to break through the window - Big Bat! Oh, how awful it was! Mary, I want you to tell me everything that I did .. Before this bat tried to get inside. Well .. first I took a bath and combed my hair .. And Maxine came to check the mosquito net. And the hook on the grid somehow turned out to be uncoupled .. Yes? Continue, what next? Well, then we talked about new perfume .. Someone poured it into the bottles on my dressing table. Dad, did you pour new perfume into my vials? No, I did not. - This? - Yes. Johnny, smells like .. "Hush, wait!" I have a guess that I want to test. But only everyone should cooperate. "We will do our best." Of course! "What phone do Carraters have?" 48 J. Operator, connect with 48 J, please. Hello, Dr. Carraters? This is Johnny Leighton. And there is. With Mary something terrible happened. You can come? - I'm coming. - Good. Johnny, I'm fine, I do not need a doctor! That's the point and it came to cooperation, Mary. You have to pretend that you have a nervous breakdown. Mr. Heath, you and Shooter have to help .. Hold Dr. Carruthers here as long as possible. Where are you going, Johnny? I'll go hunt for bats. The devil bat tried to penetrate this window. She suffers from fright. I'll give her a sedative. "Where's Mr. Leighton?" I guess he's in the garden, hunting for the devil's bat. Layton is a very brave young man. Let's Miss Heath one tablet every half hour. "Uwe, doctor." "It will calm her nerves." But the doctor, maybe you'd better stay until she calms down? By morning she will recover. Hey, doc, I do not feel much myself. Do you mind measuring my temperature? You look perfectly healthy, Mr. McGuire. You should look at my tongue, it looks like a squirrel tail, look! Try calomel. Today we can have guests. And for me it can be dangerous if they find you here. "Hi, Doc, I hope I'm not interrupting?" No, not at all. I heard that you went after the devil's bat. Successfully? No, but I thought you could help me. I do not see how I would be mon, but if you offer anything .. You could give me a little of your mixture, this after shave lotion. But how does this help catch the devil bat? I still adhere to the insane idea that this can attract a killer. I do not see what kind of connection there can be, but there is a bottle of lotion on the table. Thank you. You see, Doc, I figured something out .. On all four of the dead was this lotion, when the diabolical bat attacked. My plan is to sit in the garden, and when the assassin dives - I'll kill him. Leighton, I'm afraid all these murders have affected your mind. Doc, maybe you want to come with me and become a witness? I'm sure I'll waste my time, but I'll be glad to see your experiment. Excellent. I knew that I could count on your help. I tell you, Layton, to wait for the bat to smell the lotion-stupidity. I think I'd better go. Sit down, doc .. Bat today just lingers. You are not very talkative today, doc. What's the matter? The weapon always makes me nervous. Oh, I thought maybe you should not sit too close to me .. In case the diabolical bat appears. Based on your theory, the assassin will not attack me. I do not have this lotion. Now there is, doc. "Why did you do it?" To make the probability 50 to 50, doc. Now sit down and do not try to throw out any trick. Is not it fun when your own jugular vein is in danger? Is not that so, doc? I .. do not understand what you're talking about. Perhaps you made a mistake, when today released this your diabolical bat from the attic. Do not be afraid that the bat will kill you. I will save you for the gallows. Tell me, Doc, how did you grow such a monstrous bat? You would not understand this scientific theory. Oh, chief, what are you doing here? Young man, do not think that only you worked on this case. And you were lucky that I was here. Thank you. Did you kill the devil bat? No, she flew away. Well, here's a bird that did not fly away - and this is the killer that we both were looking for. Quick, shoot! - Where's she? - Disappeared. And the doctor, too. "Did you kill the bat?" What happened? Doc Carraters is a murderer, and he hides somewhere in the garden. You return to the house and guard Mary. Come on! Doctor! Dr. Carruthers! Doctor! Is something wrong with Johnny? Is he hurt? He was taken to my house. You'd better go with me. It was Mary! Are you all right, Mary? Help Dr. Carruthers, he's over there! Mary, this diabolical bat belonged to the doctor. He created it to commit all these murders. Well, it's too late to help.
