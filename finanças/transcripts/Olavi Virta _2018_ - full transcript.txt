Oh, night, you let me forget once Under your wing I was safe You carried me off to a dreamland And I dreamt of a fairytale I saw once again your eyes so dear and those smiling cherry lips I believed that happiness was near I believed in my fantasies Oh, night, I miss you so dearly and the fairytale land so rare I miss the time I was happy My memories carry me there I see once again your eyes so bright And those cherry lips smile again A light fills my sorrowful night My worries are gone there and then My worries are gone there and then Saturday makes you sing. - It sure does. Will you go to the dance tonight? Dallapé is playing. I most certainly will! Look here. - I see. All right. Now you're ready for the masquerade. Do we have a deal? - We have a deal. Ladies and gentlemen, today you have a chance to sing with the orchestra. Only the first ones will get on stage. This is a unique opportunity. Don't be afraid. Do it. This is your chance. Do we have a deal? Never! I'd feel like a clown. Exactly! Let's go. Here comes your first singer. Olavi Virta! "Whispering" in C major. Ladies and gentlemen, the next performer is Olavi Virta. You have a natural singing voice. Do you play an instrument? - Violin and guitar. And the piano. We have a Dallapé academy and student orchestra. You could practise and get your foot in the door, if you're interested? I most certainly am. - All right. Join the party, then. Shall I see you there? - You shall. All right. All right! I'd like to be a real musician some day. Give it a shot. As a singer, if not as an instrumentalist. Do we have a deal? - It's not that easy. No, if you don't even try. Women queue up to the room when you're on stage. Not quite. When you're a star and can choose the best lasses, remember to give the rest to your buddy. Do we have a deal? - But I'd need a proper education... Will you make excuses for the rest of your life? No, but... - You can't live your life saying "but" all the time. - True, but... Cut it out! Will you hit the town with me? I would, but... I promised mother to have dinner with her. You promised mother to have dinner. How is it going at the factory? It's going. Just fine. It was a godsend that you got the job at Strémberg. Yes, it was. What's the matter now? Has father been knocking on the door again? No. DANCE. OLAVI VIRTA SINGS. - What's that? It's a dance advertisement. People probably drink and do all sorts of things. People dance. Do you drink? - No. I don't want you to end up like your father. I won't. Promise not to quit your job. Singing is so uncertain. Many people make a living out of it. Will you promise me? No. The years have passed by There's no more euphoria My youth is already gone But the beautiful fragrance of the bird cherry tree is something I'll never ever forget But the beautiful fragrance of the bird cherry tree is something I'll never ever forget Hi. Hi. - Is the singer boy busy? Sorry, may I interrupt? I am Niilo Saarikko. Olavi Virta. I'd like to talk to you in private. Well, good night then. You sang beautifully. - Oh, thank you. And good night. - Bye. Listen. I own all the rights for Columbia Records in Finland. I've hired recording equipment and audio engineers from Germany. Yes? Bruno Laakko said you're the best singer in the Helsinki area. He suggested you become the vocalist for Dallapé. For the recordings. - Me? What do you think? - Well. Of course. I mean... definitely. Thanks, I'll pass. It hasn't become a habit. Come on, let's celebrate. Okay, then. Let's celebrate. We'll start recording in August. You need to practise. It's starting to sound all right. There's just a tiny problem with the recording. What problem? - Jéppilé has a contract with PSO that Dallapé can only record for them. The orchestra cannot record for any other labels. But it cannot restrict us as independent musicians. Let's come up with a new name. - You're right. It's not Dallapé if the name is different. Just think of another name. We're playing the whole autumn at the restaurant Bat. Does that help? The Bats! There it is. Announce the song. Bruno Laakko and his orchestra The Bats play the foxtrot "Rowan Tree". Singer: Olavi Virta. One, two, three, four! I wanted to talk to you. Do you have a permanent position at Strémberg? Is anything permanent? But I've had work so far. It's just that I need a salesperson in my record shop, and you know a thing or two about foreign music, too. So what do you say? - Me working in a record shop? Or... will you miss the factory? No, I surely won't. - So is it a deal? It most certainly is. Thanks. You've no idea how pleased I am. And it's good publicity that you'll sing a song in a film, no less. Indeed. It seems the world is getting on the right track. A TREATY SIGNED IN MOSCOW Lights, camera, action. Oh, my sweet darling There's only one thing I desire Oh, please forgive me My dear sweetheart GERMANY INVADED POLAND I know I treated you badly But you can bring joy back into this guilty heart No consolation It's something I can't find No alleviation can ever ease my mind But my sweet darling There's only one thing I desire Oh, please forgive me It's all I ask from you DEFENCE FORCES Bloody hell. President Kallio has declared a state of war. At 9 o'clock, Vyborg sounded an air raid warning, and enemy bombers started bombing the city. A heavy artillery fire started this morning at the Karelian Isthmus, and it has reached all the way to Kivennapa and Raivola. Soviet units have crossed the border and attacked areas in Raate and to the north of Lake Lagoda. Our troops keep resisting bravely... Ola! Ola, wait. I see you got a bit hurt. No, I'm just resting here for a while. No need to rush, eh? Take it easy. Easy now. Ola. If I get too tired, you continue. Sing. Sing, Ola. Never stop singing. You're a singer. Ola... Do we have a deal? Good evening. May I sit down? A Finnish soldier needs to rest his feet. Olavi. Irene. Irene... Do you have another name? Irene Dorothy Violetta. Wow, that's... Sounds very American. - Sure does. I'd love to ask you to dance, but... I wonder if the dancing ban will ever end. Everything ends, eventually. Dancing is banned, eating isn't. Am I being too forward if I would like to offer Irene Dorothy Violetta a dinner? How long is your leave? Endlessly long. My train leaves tomorrow morning. Taking me somewhere... Then I worked in the army radio as an announcer and a technician. And after that, I entertained the troops. And now that the Russians started barging again and the trench war ended, I was commanded to fight at the front. We don't have enough men anymore. I wish the war would end already. It has lasted forever. Forever? How old are you? Seventeen. - Seventeen? You have your whole life ahead of you. Thank you. I'm married. I see. Okay. And I have a six-month-old daughter. Yeah. I was sixteen when I got pregnant. And I needed the President's permission to marry because I was underage. The President gave a permission? - He did. Sulo and I tried to live together, but we knew it wouldn't work out. You got a divorce? - No. We're separated. But we're still married. So he wasn't Prince Charming. - No. God, how stupid. And childish. But Ilse is the loveliest child in the world. So that's my story. Whew, that's a relief. A relief? I thought it might have been something serious. Something that would prevent us from spending our lives together. What time is it? I have to hurry! Promise not to die a hero. I promise. Remember to write me! Here you go, Irene Dorothy Violetta. What are these? - Flowers! Fresh from the park flower bed. The train had already gone. - But you can't stay here. If I'm going to be late, I might as well be more late. I can't believe it's finally over. I'm on my way to Lappeenranta to hand over my equipment. Then I should be able to come home. We'll get you an official divorce even though it might be hard. I'll take care of the legal matters, and then you and I will get married. I will adopt little Ilse and take care of her like she's my own. Don't worry. My head is full of plans. We'll live with my mother at first. The flat is small, but we'll be all right. There would've been plenty of unmarried women. Irene is so very young. Why are you in such a rush to tie the knot? You could have taken your time... - Mother! And you'll raise another man's child! Couldn't you... - How long will you keep nagging? How can we live in this small flat? - It's only temporary. Flats are just so hard to come by right now. Look, the little miss woke up. I've planned our future so that one day, this girl will be dressed like a princess. And the other two women of my life, I'll get them fancy frocks as well. And we'll get mother Ida a nice dress and dance shoes so she'll stop moping at home all the time. Hi! - Hi. It finally happened! The dancing ban has been lifted. Goddamn, finally! Lads, we're going on a tour! Now people want to sing and dance, be merry. Olavi. Guitar and violin strings are impossible to get. I'm going to manufacture and sell those, too. - Olavi. Everything is easier now that Olavi Virta Ltd. is registered. But when will we register Olavi and Irene Ltd.? As soon as the divorce is final. Don't worry. I promise. How come it's taking so long? - Well... It's just bureaucracy. And we're not in a hurry. We're not, but this one here doesn't understand bureaucracy. Are you... - Yes. Well, that's... When is it... - In November. I was hoping we'd be married. - It doesn't matter. What matters is that there'll be more Virtas in the world! Hello. - Hi there. Take a taxi and go to the Kallio church. I booked a priest for one o'clock. He'll marry us. Mother will be there shortly to look after Ilse and Pauli. Well, what's more romantic than a Monday. I've got one more meeting before that. See you at the church at one. See you. I heard you don't have a contract with any record label. That's correct. The Sointu label offers you a generous contract. I want you to travel to Stockholm. - Stockholm? Studios are better and cheaper. Find six good songs, book a studio and musicians, record the songs, and bring the finished matrices back here. Can you do it? Certainly. When am I supposed to... Now. Immediately. I see. Well... I... ls there a problem? No, there isn't. There you go, flowers. Will you wait here and take Miss... I mean Mrs. Virta back to Pääskylänkatu street. - All right. THE SAILOR AND THE STAR In the sky, the evening star glistens I send my love to my dear family I tell the star just how much I miss them and that my heart aches at the lonely sea How was Stockholm? Splendid. Something for the wife. Straight from Stockholm. Beautiful! Why did you get something so expensive? Because we recorded a song like this: I love you I'm almost going crazy Now listen, my sweet lady, and hear my heart beat Hello. Ossi Elstelä asked me to stop by. Ola, hello! - Hello. I'm glad you came. - What's up? The bastards banned the Happy Theatre. Closed it, just like that! - Who? Home Secretary Leino gave the order, but everyone knows that it's the bloody Control Commission. We can't even let loose at a revue. - No! Or utter a few truths. We have to keep our mouths shut. But Palle and I decided to keep going. Yeah. We'll just change the name. It's now The Red Mill. Perhaps the Kremlin will prefer "red" over "happy". So, will you join the gang? - Well... I have plenty of gigs coming... - Let's do a proper cabaret! I've got all sorts of plans. You would co-star with a bunch of young, long-legged ladies. Damn it! When shall we start? L don't wanna brag, but I know an awesome lad called Kalle Aaltonen All your fears and troubles, they quickly melt away as soon as you see Kalle Aaltonen I don't wanna brag, but I know an awesome lad called Kalle Aaltonen All your fears and troubles, they quickly melt away as soon as you see Kalle Aaltonen I don't wanna brag, but I know an awesome lad called Kalle Aaltonen All your fears and troubles, they quickly melt away as soon as you see Kalle Aaltonen Thanks! Well done, Ola. An hour's break. Not even the devil shoots in this weather. The devil doesn't, but Elstelä does! Start the camera. We don't have the money to wait. BEAUTIFUL VERA The boy will never forget, ho hey the girl that he once met, ho hey Even though destiny took her away, away, away! The Princess Armada, ho hey She's our ship and our home, ho hey She's the best steamboat there is She is, she is, she is! The flower of the waves, ho hey The jewel of the shores, ho hey The waves always cherish her They do, they do, they do! The Skipper Quartet seems to have struck a chord with people. What if we built a whole film around the Skippers? Does that mean you agree? Is it a deal? I hear you loud and clear. Enjoy your evening. Sorrow, sorrow Now my poor heart is full of sorrow Your words, they brought me joy for a while But life will always find a way to wipe your smile Fleeting, fleeting The joy is fleeting, and I'm weeping Now I treat everyone suspiciously Because you lied to me Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year! Thank you! The afternoon show was good, but this was even better. A magnificent show! Thanks, everyone. See you on Wednesday. Happy New Year! - Where are you going? Home. - Where's our pay? You'll get it on Wednesday. What do you mean? - Everyone gets paid on Wednesday. What the hell? The till is full, and the show is sold out every time. It's better this way. Trust me. It's New Year's Eve. - Exactly! If I pay you, you'll drink it all. On Wednesday you'll be hung-over, asking for an advance. No, we won't! - Hey, you'll thank me later when you haven't drunk every penny on New Year's. If you don't pay, I'll quit. No you won't. - Give me my money, now! On Wednesday. Fine, goddammit. You can pay me on Wednesday, but it'll be my last pay. I'm leaving now for good. Goodbye and a happy new year. Big orchestras are no longer in. No-one books groups as big as Dallapé anymore. You could start your own group. That's what you've been dreaming about. That's exactly what I'll do. Four or five lads will do just fine. The burning sun and the golden moon Someone might find them so beautiful But what warms my heart and what makes me twirl is this adorable curly-haired girl Your hair is on flames, and so is your heart too You are my red-headed girl I remember a time when I gently caressed you Now those moments are forever gone You asked me to share my happiness with you You were my red-headed girl But I chose to refuse, and now I feel so blue I can't find happiness anymore Who is the one who now strokes your curls? Who has the bliss you once gave to me? Perhaps he buys you jewels and pearls Perhaps he's better than I'd have been But with this song, my heart always careens to see my red-headed girl Even though you are gone and nowhere to be seen Let me come now to you in my dreams Marjaana! Mother! Who's car is that? Are you still sleeping? How come you're still in bed? I was so sleepy. Well, was he any good? Who? Olavi Virta! Olavi Virta? Yes, him. Was he any good? Yes. He was good. So he knew what he was doing. He did! You've thrown your clothes all over the floor. Time to get to work. This is what you get when you dance all night long. My darling If you never ever will be mine My soul will be consumed by the black and dreary night I think about you every morning I dream about you at night And every single evening, I yearn to be by your side I love you I'm almost going crazy Now listen, my sweet lady, and hear my heart beat As soon as a lad gets some dough He pours it down his throat I see we have a visitor. Give a hand to Olavi Virta. Olavi and his orchestra, when they come to town They're so charming that they'll have you smitten and spellbound Fathers, mothers, doctors, they all appeal to you Quickly take your daughters, lock them up into their rooms All right. I can tell you that it wasn't all that surprising When I heard the way Olavi Virta is behaving In the pharmacy, I learned Latin from miss Blanche She told me syphilis is not a modern dance Even the memories divine They itch for a long, long time Thank you. You're on the road again. What's your route this time? We go up in the east, turn around in Kemijärvi, and come down the west coast. The tour takes the whole summer. I know. We'll get to see the reindeer and the north again. The bloody reindeer. During the trench war, it was my turn to empty the privy. In the evening, I saw a big herd of reindeer roaming nearby. In the morning, I started emptying the privy, but it was completely empty. Well. I saw the beasts licking their lips with gusto, and I thought I'd never eat reindeer again. And I haven't. Sauteed reindeer, sir. All right)'- Goddamn, Repe. You don't eat reindeer! Who told you that? Good evening, artists. May I disturb you for a second? You may, but it costs. Five litres of cut brandy. I was about to suggest that. Wow. - It's my company's annual party. I thought I'd ask if the gentlemen could perform there for a while. I'll pay of course. - Well, it's 20,000 Finnish marks. That's fine. - Per person. All right. - Per song. Of course. And as much food and drink as you want. Goddamn. The Finnish bourgeoisie is a civilised bunch. L don't wanna brag, but I know an awesome lad called Kalle Aaltonen All your fears and troubles, they quickly melt away as soon as you see Kalle Aaltonen I'm enquiring if my husband Olavi Virta is staying in your hotel? Mr. Virta. You have a phone call. I see. I'm coming! Thank you! Get your bloody hands off me! You're a married man! Did you light the fire? With one match. Harriet doesn't want to fall asleep. Should we have some wine? It's such a nice day. No, thanks. And maybe you shouldn't have any, either. Yeah. Luckily we were able to rent this place. Now the whole family can get away from home. I've got plans after we've saved up a decent nest egg. Then we'll get this flock a flashy apartment. Do you have to leave tomorrow? I have to go. I can't help it. Children! Soon we'll go to the sauna. THE EXTREMELY POPULAR SKIPPER QUARTET OLAVI VIRTA AND HIS ORCHESTRA THE SKIPPER QUARTET Vera was a wanderer, oh, so fair She had dark skin and pitch-black hair Vera said to every man "No way!" And Vera blew everyone's mind away And the steamboat that we loved was called Princess Armada We floated timber all day long on the waves of Lake Saimaa We're the Skipper Quartet. Next up is Olavi Virta and his orchestra. This road leads us to happiness and blissfulness But only if you're not afraid to join me Gone are the days when I was sad and blue Today, I finally get to be with you And so this road will lead us into happiness and bliss and take us to ecstasy All right. The same amount for everyone. How do we know how much you got? It's like when you were the treasurer on Käyhkö's filming trip. Things didn't quite add up! Goddamn. Kake, you checked the accounts. Was there anything dubious? Well... No. Or did you even get more money when I was in charge? Well... - Did you? Well, I guess we did. Yeah. We've worked our arses off for a couple of years now, and you keep talking bullshit! - Shouting won't solve anything. You heard there's nothing to solve. There is. The boys and I have talked. The boys and you. You didn't consider talking to me? We are doing that now. - You should forget your own band and focus on the Skippers. Is that so? - Yes. Is it a wish or a suggestion? It's a decision. - You've got to choose. And every lad agrees? - Yeah, we kinda do. It's not a tough choice. - About the accounts... Can't you stop, damn it? - No. And you don't trust Käyhkö? - I do, but not you. Will you shut up already? - No. Boys, this is the best dance orchestra in Finland. And nothing will stop us! - That's right! Shit. Shit! Goddamn, Ola. You're one lucky son of a gun. No-one will come here before morning, damn it. Stop moping, grown men. Tonight we'll stay in a nice hotel, I promise. Hello. A hundred hot sausages. And something to flush it down with. - A proper buffet! Dig in. So you already put it on. Those bloody boys were fooling around. I guess they did it when I fell asleep in the car. And they filled it for you, too. What was it called, the film you shot last summer? "L Hate You, Darling." Exactly. Shit. Is it just the two of you? Where's your mother? - She went to see a judge. I'm sure she'll be back soon. A judge? Dad, are we going to move? Mum started packing our clothes already. You're not sleeping here. Go home. I guess I don't have a home. She hangs up every time I call. Women sure are awful. Mr. Singer has been away for a week piss-arse drunk, pitying himself. And the wife refuses to give him a warm hug and welcome him home. I wonder why. Well, have a drink. That's your last supper. - You'll stop drinking and man up. We have work to do. You like your drink, too. - But you have to do your job! And keep your home base clean. It's easy to lose track when everyone pats you on the back and shoves money into your pockets. The booze is free, and the women are easy. With this face, I haven't had that problem. I've done some research. The flat you went to see is now available. So take off your hat and go see the bank manager. Maybe Cupid will come back when there's more space. Hi. Come on in. Come on now. Hi. What is this place? - Well... This is our home. - Are we going to live here? We sure are. - Our home. Yes. What do you think? Is it good enough? This is huge. The colour of her eyes... Let's take a closer look. ...is a thing I can't describe Her eyes just gleam in my dreams The contours of her face are a thing I can't describe They only exist in my dreams If I could be a painter, the Mona Lisa would look paler My painting marvellous, like Michelangelo's Like a dawn of a new day I see the image in my brain But that I can't do, describe her eyes to you Ah, I remember this! Do you remember this? - Now it comes. No... Dad, don't! I told you that this bit... That was funny. All the cupboards and furniture were brought from America. And this gas cooker. All the way from America. - Yes. And this is a new innovation even in America. A fridge with a freezer compartment. You can freeze anything in it. And that, gentlemen, is the future. You can't get these in Finland. - Sure, sure. Does the artist himself use these fancy appliances? Does Mr. Virta cook? Yes, Olavi cooks when he's at home and has the time. Sure, when he has the time... ls your husband a good cook? - Yes, he is. Very experimental. What's your favourite dish, sir? - It must be meatballs. Nothing beats good meatballs. Yeah, that's right. Do you like your father's cooking, children? Yes, we do. - Sure, sure. Who's the best cook, mum or dad? - Well... Mum. - Sure, sure. And here we have an aquarium. It's beautifully lit and mounted on the wall. Yes. I got the idea on one of my trips abroad. On a trip. Sure, sure. How does it feel, madam, when so many Finnish women admire your husband and envy you and want to take your place by his side? Yes, it's a part of Olavi's work. It's amazing that people like him and his songs so much. Sure, sure. Aren't you jealous of his admirers? And here's the sauna. - Sauna! In an apartment! - Yes. An electric heater, and a head full of ideas. When I see the sky, oh so blue I long to stroll on its blue avenue I yearn to soar high like a bird But now I'm chained to the earth When I see the sky, oh so blue I long to stroll on its blue avenue They'll be there in a week. Goodbye. PRODUCTION MANAGER OLAVI VIRTA Let's drink to that. "An American gas cooker is the centre of Olavi Virta's kitchen." "One can use a timer to turn the cooker on or off at a desired time." Damn! Someone should invent a controlling apparatus for women. For women? - Yes. One could use a timer to turn them on and off. I thought you composed this. - I did. Stone is my pseudonym. Or people will think I write all the songs. Of course. I saw Rautavaara at a café today. - You shouldn't go to cafés. Are you two still not talking? It is what it is. When I suggested you as the romantic hero for the new Puupää film, I didn't know you'd act with Ruth Johansson. I should've warned the poor girl. Remember the old adage: "Don't shit where you eat." It'll only cause you trouble. Maybe, maybe not. You're just jealous. Now listen to me, bro, when I tell you how it goes It strains a man's brains if too many games at the same time he plays and has a new dame every day That's uncalled for. - Right. No need to fuss, the miss's crotch is something I merely dismiss. Your eyes are the only thing I miss Just because of your blue eyes All right, let's record a song. When I look deep into your eyes I can understand Why happiness is so alluring like a wonderland Your eyes contain the warmth of the sun Your eyes contain the glimmer of the moon Just because of your blue eyes I want to sing this song divine Just because of your blue eyes I reach the stars high in the sky When I see your eyes, I see your heart If one has a trusted friend The sky becomes so bright The sky becomes so bright Just because of your blue eyes I can clear the cloudy sky Just because of your blue eyes I can move the mountainside I'd throw away everything I own When you only look at me With your eyes so blue With your eyes so blue There you go, miss. - Thank you. The receipt. Bye. Hello. Will you stay the rest of the day? I must go to a meeting. And after that, I have a gig. Could you open up in the morning? All right. I'll ask your mother to come again tomorrow. Even though it would be your job to ask her. She wasn't exactly smiling today when she came. What's the important meeting about? Record label business. Bye then. That's what it takes. - Indeed. Ola, goddamn! We were wondering where you were. I brought you presents. Cuba libre! HOTEL TORNI The lads went to the wealthy America. - That's right. We sold quite a pile of records to Finnish Americans. One night, we were coming back from a tavern, and I saw this stunning Ford Fairlane in the car dealership window. Okay. - The dealer's jaw dropped when Saarikko piled the notes on his hand. He asked "Are you serious?" And I said "No Sirius, from Finland!" I've never found such a cheap car in Finland, and the freight was free! Ford Fairlane. A drink to that. All right, I've got to go. - In the middle of the evening? I have a gig in Kotka, and I have to hurry. A gig in "Eagle town", an arm around a crow Or a bird of some sorts A bird of some sorts Be careful. The police are stalking on the street again. I always am. Bye! - Bye. Good evening, officers. Bye then. Stop behind the corner. Yes, this is fine. Thank you. The others, they are all dancing You hear, Eva, this lovely tune plays just for us Eva, so captivating are happy moments that our love and music create just for us So long you stayed, so long alone I looked at heaven and I thought about you, dear You came, and in my arms I took you, Eva, and I danced with you away among the stars Your eyes so bright and open tell me not to worry We'll never walk this road alone again Howdy. A few sausages, so you won't fall asleep. HOTEL TORNI It's all so enchanting, everything is magic All else fades, and only one thing stays It is our love, of course, and the shimmer of the moon Nothing else is true, it's just us two Dad! Oh, hi. Go home to sleep. Take Harriet. Ask your mother to make sure you can sleep. I'll take care of the shop. Hello, young lady. Is your father here? - Yes. What are you doing here? I came to see my son. And my grandchildren. Dad, someone's at the door. You're leaving right now. You have no business here. No-one wants you here. Get out. Do you hear? - ls it up to you? Just a moment. Wait. If he's staying, I'll go right now. And don't try to ask me to come here and babysit anymore. Give me your coat and come in. Did you hear me? Olavi! This is none of your business. So you crawl back with your hand outstretched? Now that Olavi has become wealthy. - Mother! You know I visited often. But you always threw me out. Once Olavi threw my arse in the snow. And he did the right thing! Mother! You're free to leave or stay. It's all right, Harriet. This is your grandfather. Hello, Harriet. - Hello. That skinny little boy is only ten years old His messy, curly hair disappears behind the stairs He's just a little boy exactly like the others He knows that all the sunny days have also shadows He whistles when he scurries through his murky alleys where tourists walk and lassies talk every night It's so nice to finally meet you. You have no idea how much I enjoy this. Seeing you and especially the younger generation. Your grandchildren. - You've accomplished something, son. A pretty flock like this. But the kids are bound to be beautiful, since their mother is so beautiful and good-natured. I'm sure you've heard a lot about me. I haven't been a perfect father. I've had a messy life. And problems with alcohol. Well, no father is perfect. But I guess Olavi inherited his musicality from you. Yeah, I guess it was good that I set you on the piano. It was. I'm glad you did. I just mean it wasn't for nothing. If it helped you to create all this. A fancy setting, and life on the right track. Excuse me. Excuse us, could Mr. Virta sign these for us? We were having dinner, but all right. Thank you. - To Seija. Is it always like this? Mostly, yes. He knows the alleys and their shades He's never ever lost his way His mother doesn't ever stop him from running through the unsafe alleys Any fatherly advise he's never got in his life That skinny little boy is only ten years old But this very cheerful beat he picked up in the streets He is only ten years old! Don't you want to sit, Mr. Viljanen? Thanks, but I'd rather stand. Viljanen is standing straight on his back With so much booze, others would be slack But a musician can take all the drink he craves Only a gentleman can drink with such grace A drink to that. - Indeed. You fucking Virta can't even write songs. Everyone knows it. Does anyone know this citizen? You've bought songs with booze and put your own name on them. Oh. Do you have anything to sell besides that snotty tie? Don't... Don't, you fucking... Don't start jumping down my throat! Goddamn operetta clown! Okay, I think that was the last call. Hello. I'm Viljanen. All right, an after-party at my place. Thanks, but Topi and I will share a taxi to Sorrento. Butler, put the drinks and the broken glassware on my tab. That sloven can't afford this. I fucking can. Bring it on. Well, you can charge this gentleman, then. You bet! How are you, son? Just fine. More gigs than ever, and the records sell like hot cakes. That's excellent. - Yes. So... I thought I'd ask up front. What happened between you and mother back then... Was it just alcohol or... Alcohol! Yeah. Did you know, son, that I used to be a shoemaker? Goddamn, of course I did. A shoemaker went from house to house, stayed a week or two, and made shoes for the whole family. And every night, the man of the house would offer him alcohol. So that the shoemaker would give him a discount. Many of us got hooked. Even me. Plenty of people like to buy me drinks, too. Things at home are a bit dense. I thought you might have experience. Who are you? Goddamn! Don't you remember me, old man? Don't, don't! Do you know that I'm Olavi Virta's father? Yeah, you think I'm completely senile and don't understand a thing, but listen, you fucking brat. I can tell you that I used to know your father very well. Right. Well, let's drink to that. He's a great man. Hello. How are you? Where are you? - In Tampere. Are you coming home? - Yes. How's the baby? - Here she is, cooing. Will you put the phone on Sheila's ear? Peekaboo! Sheila. It's dad here. Dad is going to sing a few songs, and then dad will come home. Sheila! I have to go. Bye. Well, bye. Is Olavi here? - Who is asking? I am. ls he here? Olavi is at a gig. I can wait for him here. - Excuse me. Olavi promised to take me to dinner. Just like every Friday. I'm sure he did. Who do you think you are? Olavi needs me. He can't sing without me. All his songs, he sings them to me. They are about me. - You should go, miss. The love between us is something you know nothing about. And you can't take it away from me! Goddammit! If only you knew what it's like! Good morning! What are you doing? I thought I'd make meatballs. It's hard to wind down. In the middle of the night? Is it good? Do you have to drink all night long? It helps me relax. After a gig. And before a gig. And during it. And after the gig. At work. At home. How long do you think I'm going to put up with this chaos? And you. How long will you put up with it? I Will. Your women are already barging into our home. And that I can't handle. She was just a crazy fan. She made it all up. Olavi. I could've believed that a few years ago, but not anymore. No woman can take it if her husband drinks and chases every skirt! But I've done good things, too. Our home, the children... How do I know how many children you have around the parishes? I've received letters like that, too! All kinds of floozies claim that their children are yours! I'm losing my mind! And who can blame me? Annikki Tähti... and Olavi Virta. Okay, I'll buy them. The rest is just some jazz. You tricked me, damn it. - A deal is a deal. What are you up to, boys? Where did you get these? - Pauli sold them to me. I see. It always pays to do business. Was it worth the money? - It's jazz. You bought some good jazz. What's your name, lad? - Vesa-Matti. Vesa-Matti what? - Loiri. I see. Vesa-Matti starts listening and playing jazz, then. Eh? Yeah. - You might make a living out of it. Or out of that. Never take anything without permission again. - Okay. I'm going on the road again. See you. - See you. Long gone is my bustling life And I don't have a love or a wife My horse used to run himself sore Now I don't need to beat him no more Nobody in this world misses me The cold wind is my only company Horseman, there is no need to hurry You cannot escape your destiny What are you doing? - Play amongst yourselves, damn it. I'm off. When did you get so drunk? You had some, too. - You have to do your job! We agreed not to drink before gigs this time. Look who's preaching, goddamn! I preach because I'm the boss! I'm responsible if we don't play. Here he is. Lock him up for a while, so he can rest. Don't touch me! You fucking pigs! Goddamn, let go of me! I'm an artist! I'm an artist, for fuck's sake! I see. Let's pack up and go home. Aren't you going to play anymore? How do we play without an accordionist? No, this is unacceptable. - Bye! Hey. Hey! A BAND PASSED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW Olavi Virta's record shop. "The assistant police chief Ruuth in llomantsi had discovered that the lead singer was so drunk that the doorman had to lift him up on his feet repeatedly." Bloody hell. It's all rubbish. That was the tenth gig that got cancelled. "People started demanding the band or their money back." "But the only one who came back on stage was the accordionist." Every paper is full of the same lies. Week after week. That is not going to help! I know. I need something stronger. Olavi Virta's record shop. HOTEL TORNI I should've been there, so you wouldn't have had to use him. Things would be different. You wouldn't be screwed. It's not your fault. I was the one who hired the group for the tour. What's done is done. Every company has stopped delivering records until the bills get paid. All the gigs for the next two months have been cancelled. I managed to book a gig for next week. Now you're coming with me because... Yeah, yeah. Listen. Have something to eat. I'll be there soon. The bank refuses to continue our mortgage! Because the instalments haven't been paid in time. Take it one day at a time. Don't think about tomorrow. Everything will sort itself out. Or we can sell the whole bloody flat and use that money to pay what we can. I'll be right there. Olavi Virta, I presume. Who's asking? - My duty is to repossess this car due to unpaid debts. Here are the official documents. In the middle of my tour? I almost forgot. So this is how it is? Yes. Where? To Stockholm. I got a job there. I see. You're taking everything from me, but you can't take my voice. So you also lost your job at Levytukku? So I bloody did. I guess it was partly my own fault for not doing the job properly. So you don't have a place to record anymore? I guess not. Minor is the poor man's major. But you go to Stockholm every week to see your kids. I have,yes. Last time they didn't even let me in. I never thought it'd be this hard. That's life. But hey, there was a big crowd at yesterday's gig. There was. But we don't have too many gigs these days. And this won't sustain you boys for very long, either. That's true. Should we, in spite of everything, take a few drinks when we get to town? Absolutely. Virta. It's Jaakko Salo, hello. Hello. What's up? I thought that you could stop by here at the Scandia studio when you've got the time. - Sure. I'll stop by. All right. Good. See you, bye. - Bye. Now that we have a contract, I thought we could also record some of your old songs again for Scandia. For example "Night, You Let Me Forget" "Red Leaves", and so on. Fine by me. I know the songs. Yeah, and the equipment is a lot better than after the war. And this is a song by an Italian composer, Malgoni. "Guarda Che Luna". Reino Helismaa translated it into Finnish. I added a saxophone solo. I told Seppo Rannikko to use a stiff reed and play like Sonny Rollins. Yeah. Let's sing it away. - All right. Press the record button, Arska. The silvery moon shines on the calm sea There can never be again an evening like this I'm waiting in vain for you, my darling The moon goes hiding in the clouds, the sea is murky I feel this longing My heart is aching I know my happiness is now again deserted You watch the moon with someone else now Another man has taken you now The silvery moon shines on the calm sea The silvery moon shines on the calm sea There can never be again an evening like this I'm waiting in vain for you, my darling The moon goes hiding in the clouds, the sea is murky I feel this longing My heart is aching I know my happiness is now again deserted You watch the moon with someone else now Another man has taken you now Never again an evening like this No, never! This is not going to work. You behaved a couple of months. Then you reverted to your old habits. Come on. Everything is all right. We appealed against the drink-driving verdict. Then we'll see what happens. We know what will happen. And it's not just that. Nothing has changed. I promise that... - Don't. Don't make promises you can't keep. It's better that way. But you like your job at Stockmann. Mother looks after the kids. I have plenty of work, the records sell, and... Everything else is fine! It's just that I can't trust you. At all. Think about the children. - They're all I think about. They can't handle new disappointments. No-one can. Hey... Hey... - Don't. So the maestro had to relearn how to talk after the stroke? To talk and... ...to walk. But you can still sing. Yes. Doesn't it feel bitter to get dragged all over the country by managers? To sing a few songs and be gawped at by people. I am a singer. - Sure, sure. But you must know that they're leeching off you. Making money and taking advantage of you. Yes. Unlike you journalists. - Yes. Sure, sure. And now you live here, in Pispala. In Hulda's loving care. Where did you find her? When Olavi asked if I could help him, I asked what kind of help he needed. He said nothing special. Just cooking and doing the laundry. When Olavi had to go to the hospital again, I picked up his few belongings from his flat. And then he moved here. People say all kinds of things. But I'm old enough to be his mother. - Sure. Have you stayed in contact with Irene? Your wife. My ex wife. And very rarely. We had an idea at the office... The magazine could take you abroad, the maestro and Irene. And we'd write an article about the trip. You could reminisce together, and maybe the southern sun will even rekindle your flame. Maestro, I'm really sorry about their behaviour. No need to be sorry. I can tell you that this happens to you, too, some day. When summer flees, the leaves in trees they start glowing, shining so brightly It's like a longing that leaves a memory so beautiful but sorrowful Just a while longer leaves will glow And their splendour will then be gone The leaves of our lost love are now rotten The wind picks them up as it goes I hope sometimes that you remember it too The summer when we were in love, just us two The sun seemed to smile so warmly at me when I, darling, walked beside you on the street The summer of love did not last very long The winter came, now it's all gone All that was left is a mere memory I feel my heart burning with agony If you have some beautiful memories, then you can be a wealthy man You can't ever give them away Just hide them into your heart What do you think, Irene? Has this trip made you closer? Well, you could say that. Can I write that "the old flame was rekindled, and two hearts found each other again beneath the southern cross"? Maybe nothing quite like that. Well, we'll see. Thank you. "Two hearts found each other again beneath the southern cross"? Yeah, the things they come up with... Olavi. Did you hope that we... I have missed you. I've also missed the man I fell in love with. And I've never found anyone else who would have meant something. Someone like you. That's quite a thing to say. After all those women. - Yeah... I've never found anyone else, either. I guess I've always compared them to you. You set the bar pretty high. Despite everything. Even though this might sound childish, I have to say that you... ...were the love of my life. You were, and still are. But you must know it too that nothing could come of us anymore. I know. I know that. Olavi Virta was the first entertainer in Finland who was granted an artist's pension in June 1972. He received it for one month before he died.
