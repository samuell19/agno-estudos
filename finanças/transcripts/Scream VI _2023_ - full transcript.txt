the fuck I never deleted his contact This is coming from his number Don't pick that up Just let her in Sam Who is this Hello Samantha Did you miss me I want you to think long and hard about whether

the chance So what You're protecting us now Not quite I'm going to show the world who you really are A lot I'm going to punish you Sam You shouldn't believe everything you read on the Internet asshole Don't be cute You're gonna pay for what you did And I'm not gonna stop until I butchered you And you and anyone who gets between us You and Tara better watch your back You better watch yours On Monday Yes You got a problem here guy Right I want the back Thank you It's locked This was found next to the body at the apartment crime scene DNA says that if long as someone named Richie Kirsch That ringing bell We're familiar with him but the one that attacked us had a different mask on It was kind of more beat up like it was older Kind of ask Do malibus for earlier tonight How's that A party with my friends I was at my therapist I can give you his information You can call to check if you want And then I met Tara at that party where I'd taste someone Unrelated Is that before or after this happened Before the point is we are with people so our roommates dad Just happened to pull our case That'd be a crazy coincidence right Yeah The detective who had the case he offered it to me Music goals Quinn But I can totally give it back If you're uncomfortable it's up to you It's fine So if the man who attacked you did steal your license and planted next to the body And it probably be somebody close to you I wanna be on your friends when we moved here with Mindy and Chad for summer semester like six months ago so Quinn Ethan Annika ostenson They can't get involved for Quinn so that's one less we have to worry about Do either of you have anyone that might want to target Not only when he's alive Yikes FBI is here claiming jurisdiction Where are they Can I help you Especially during FBI I work out of the Atlanta office You're too big for residents of my city Before they moved here for college I've been investigating their online activity for the past few months Take a special interest and ghost face attacks Kirby Hey Sam Alright Tara you're the FBI There's no issue there Yeah we went to Woodsboro high together She was a senior when I was a freshman We share a certain history Yeah but I'm not trying to get into a jurisdictional pissing contest here I just want to help I'll show you mine etcetera This mask at the bodega team and traces of two individuals Charlie Walker Joe Roberts both deceased These killers of 2011 Charlie Walker gave me this Like I said I take a special interest Is this the mess he was wearing when he attacked you No He's leaving them on purpose which means whoever's doing this is a student of the killers who came before Maybe he believes Sam's the latest in a long line Yeah good luck with that I'm sorry that's not possible You're both persons of interest in a double homicide so you're not allowed to leave town Sorry are you serious He's right But if we work together we're going You have an alibi Just saying your sister Sarah Weathers Channel 4 Do you ladies think you're the reason the Ghostface killer has come to the Big Apple Nice try sweetie but I've done this dance before Ohh Stay away from us Are you really still mad at me You said you wouldn't write a book about what happened and then you wrote a book about what happened Come on somebody was going to write about it That's what I do I know if you could tell the movie rights it's it's all about true Crime limited series these days after everything we went through together What would you rethink That's a low blow So was your book You called me unstable and a born killer That's taken out of context That's literally a quote You don't think what you wrote has something to do with what's happening to us Come on Hey I talked to Sydney She's not coming here is she No She sends her love but she's taking Mark and the kids someplace safe She deserves to have her happy ending And not much we agree Hey I want to catch this fucker as much as you do Maybe Or maybe you're just afraid that without ghost face in your life you're going to fade away Danger Where's that You're a day early for trick or treating you know Listen up It's terrifying as this all is I'm actually glad I get a Calling the killers last time It's fine OK the way I see it someone is out to make a sequel to the Requel What's that Raquel You're beautiful sweetie Let's hold questions to the end Stab one took place in Woodsboro Step two took place in college Do we think that the killer is trying to copy the movies That is one possibility Heroes now in college Check Suspicious new characters brought in to round out the suspect list and Or body count Check check and check I don't like this I can't just be about Step 2 Why not It would make sense if this were just a sequel but we're not in a sequel because nobody just makes sequels anymore We're in a franchise and there are certain rules to a continuing franchise I had a feeling rule one Everything is bigger than last time Bigger budget bigger cast bigger body count longer chases Shootouts beheading to that atop what came before to keep people coming back Beheadings beheadings rule 2 Whatever happened last time expect the opposite Franchises only survived by subverting expectations if the killers last time were whiny snowflake film nerds with Letterboxed accounts instead of personalities You can bet the opposite will be true here and Rule 3 no one is safe Legacy characters Cannon fodder at this point usually brought back only to be killed off in some cheap bid for nostalgia It's not looking too good for Galen Kirby Ohh And that's not even the worst part This is the problem she tells us The worst part The worst part is franchises are just continuing episodic installments designed to boost an IP which means main characters are completely expendable now too Laurie Strode Nancy Thompson Ellen Ripley Sally Hardesty Jigsaw Tony Stark James Bond I mean even Luke Skywalker all died so their franchises could live on That means it's not just a friend group Any of us could go at any time Especially Sam and Tara Agree with any of us this and am I in the front room Am I like one of the targets of Am I going to diverge That was a weird overshare but it brings us to our current suspects Ethan A shy dorky guy who no one suspects because he's so shy and dorky OK wait what Why am I on the suspect list Because I'm randomly Chad's roommate Roommate Lotteries can be juked You could have fixed it to get next to us Glenn The slutty roommate a horror movie Classic sex positive but thank you Umm how did you come to live with Sam and Tara I answered their ad online OK say no more You've already implicated yourself enough It was an anonymous ad Mindy and you know we vetted her Plus her dad is a cop and that makes it more likely that she's the killer because having a cop dad is a great coverage Do you not remember how these movies work Tara She always liked this and finally Annika Never trust the love interest OK So we have our rules and we have our suspects So wait wait what about you guys I mean I think it's pretty safe to rule out the four of us who went through this last year in Woodsboro Not agreed What if the trauma you all went through caused one or or more of you to snap Yeah or the fame you got from the killings made you thirsty for more I mean let's be honest here some of the theories online about Sam are don't you fucking dare OK she's right though I mean if face facts if we're all suspects you're all set Remember Samantha Carpenter's alibi therapist was stabbed to death doesn't nose through the nose and my stuff is that It's pretty messed up He turned her in for making threatening remarks ended up dead and guess which patients notes were stolen So Sam kills her own Alba and steals her own session notes Another mask was found at the scene It's a DNA match for Roman Bridger Ghostface who was directing Step 3 It's like he's leaving us real life franchise Easter eggs Dropping the village mass in reverse Almost like he's counting down to something What happens when he gets to one So we've had nine Ghostface killers so far alright but I thought in the movies forget about the movies and movies don't We look last year was Amber Freeman and Richie Kirsch whose mass we found at the first crime scene along with the bodies of two film students who killed the professor earlier that same night That it was Jill Roberts and Charlie Walker There's a bodega Roman Bridger was the only single ghost face Kudos to him for ambition His mask was found at the strikes It's just leaves Mickey Altieri Nancy Loomis Demarker #1 the father of our chief suspect Whoever is doing this is leading us back to Sam I will check in later and tell your daughter to stay sharp proximity to the carpenter's proximity to go space Hey Jack Call the Atlanta Field office Pick up what you can on Agent Reid I think you should get out of the city you know considering what happened to you last time I wouldn't blame you if You want It's very thoughtful of you but I don't think I'm going anywhere Will you 2 just make out already That is so inappropriate you know whatever In Overwatch hey go down Yeah we do not have to stay here Well too bad I insist Safety in numbers should be so fun Little slumber party with the Core 4 Core four Yeah Did you just give us a nickname

because I just did core 4 up top No don't get that away from me Please for the love of God don't do it You know I would actually like one more respect and support from my fellow Listen to the guys What the hell We're hearing from sources inside the homicide division of the prime suspect is not That's Samantha Carpenter one of the survivors No killings in 2022 seen here attacking a woman on the street last Problem with In the wake of the Last year The Carpenter was When Version I know you're not a fan of the way that I've been handling things And then I've been doing a really hard time But I

names to make this place How did you find it It's called investigative journalism for a reason How didn't you find it Weren't you tracking them I went through their financial records dozens of times and this was not in any of them This makes sense Don't worry I'm just really good at my job Don't get there What is this place What's with all the security It's movie theater It's not just a theater It's a shrine I thought the whole God damn franchise Chad This is uncle Randy's We've gotten everything Because then if I was stabbed with you all have been through so much Motril Motril allies How did they get all this stuff I mean isn't this evidence Well cops like money and evidence can get lost pretty easily Present company excluded of course Why am I here exactly My alibi checks out so I can keep an eye on you roomie The killer must have found this place before he murdered Jason and Greg and then he took the mask off the mannequins All nine from Stu and Billy to Amber and Richard God damn how fucking cool is this place Fuck no Fuck yes Come on Sam You got to be excited to get our murder on again together Billy and Sam's team Loomis I'm ready to slice up more motherfuckers What are you doing I don't know So somebody killed these chuckle fucks and Took over Took over someone who believes that Sam masterminded Woodsboro If this were a normal staff movie this would be the killer Slayer Which means this isn't normal Stevie TV that tilts too much her if you believe he's dead I hear you're a horror fan it's been said Best nightmare on Elm Street The original Best friend at the 13th Part 2 chapter Had a crush on Corey Feldman OK respect Psycho two is underrated Candyman the original or equal both OK OK Game recognize game OK So when do I get to be a normal person again I

made a mess of it Where's your mother and all this She cut me off when I told Tara about Billy Then Tara cut her off because she wouldn't talk to me So No neither of us have a mother I'm sorry to say this but fuck her my parents said too But you can still make your own family even if it's just with one person If you lose that one person They just you keep going Maybe you find another loaner and you look after each other How did you get past what happened to you I almost died after I was stabbed Technically I did die for four minutes When I recovered I got mad I didn't want to spend the rest of my life being afraid of monsters I wanted the monsters to be afraid of me You're like that Sorry to interrupt I think I might have an idea about how to turn the tables on this screen Yeah we're in Sorry GAIL No press allowed Police business I'm good at my job too You should have stayed with the others It's not going to happen There's no point in both of us putting ourselves at risk No I'm back up So we're really doing the phone tracing thing that never works in the movies It'll be all keep him talking Sam Two more minutes I've almost got him And then he hangs up Just before we can get a lock I can trace a call And under 15 seconds Well you've got them out there as baked because the killer usually calls from somewhere nearby And you think they're safe because it's broad daylight in a public place Look I am here OK And so is Bailey This is exactly how our Uncle Randy died Broad daylight Public place changed into a van Step step step No more Randy Hey Sam Hey frosty out there OK we're good You're going to die You know you're gonna die Samantha choking on your own blood How will I hack up your sister If we find you first for a mastermind you're not very bright Waiting for me

see this car now Car You can't steal a cop car That would be our food Hello Not the food it's for you Who is it Ask who's calling please He says it's the killer Hello Hello GAIL it's strange that you and I have never spoken on the phone This is long overdue I agree I figured after all these years you'd want an interview You figured right So what's your motive this time Are you angry at the movies or you just trying to stay relevant I could ask you the same don't you know the legacy characters are disposable now Nobody cares about last centuries heroes and why bother with me at all Call it nostalgia Or maybe you deserve to be punished for all that money you made off the misery of others Maybe it's time someone made a buck reporting your death You know you're like the 10th guy to try this right And spoiler alert It never works out for the dipshit in the mask Oh but they certainly leave a mark before they go don't they Richie and Amber managed to butcher Dewey carved him up like a Christmas goose How does it feel to lose the only man who ever loved you Fuck you How does it feel to know that you weren't there for him at the end Not there to give him comfort as he died screaming in his own God You're the one who's gonna die screaming maybe but you won't be around to see it You couldn't stop what happened to Dewey Just like you're not going to be able to stop this How's that for nostalgia fucker You missed Sure I did You win I'm in the elevator heading for the ground floor Sure you are You just had me Maybe I'm wound Or maybe I'm wearing a bulletproof vest That's why I'm going to shoot you in the fucking head You would have made a good killer Gale Sydney never would have made sense and Dewey was the fan favorite but you cracking under the pressure and turning into Ghost Face would have been a great twist Keep talking asshole What do you want to talk about You never got to be the leading lady did you It was always all about poor sweet Sydney sucking up all the oxygen Where did that leave you to be The brains and the sex appeal Sorry about your boyfriend Sorry about your boyfriend All those muscles didn't help much Can you hold please Huh Fuck you OK Yeah

Get the backboard We need to move now Stop Let's move I got used faces Did you You scared you guys I really don't want to get hurt again And they do it Don't want you getting hurt again either no So what are we doing now Maybe he gets to win this time He wants to punish me Me So maybe they let him I'll just give myself up If this is what I have to do To keep you safe It's worth it No we're not

location and travel inside Then what We execute them It can help us Let's kill this son of a bitch I'm stuck here But you'll give us the key cards to the theater instead of having surveillance and security cameras But we can use that against him I can go ahead and remember traveling public more people around you left Fancy has to take a shot at you before you get there This is even a good plan

We turned it into a killbox weapons one gun and I hold on to it I am the only one with a badge here and that's the way it's gonna be We're safe here We're safe here I'm going to check in with Mindy see if they're close Hey You know you're not safe here Whenever someone says we're safe here it means you're not Not now You're smarter than this Sam Grab a weapon and clear this place yourself You know I'm right Excellent choice My favorite Curvy Kirby Hello Get everyone out of there Say you're not safe I heard from the Atlanta Field office They said agent three They said Agent Reed's been on a downward spiral ever since the Woodsboro murders last year What are you talking about They fired Kirby two months ago for being mentally unstable She's no longer with the FBI Use this place so old I'm sorry you can you can have just No I mean listen if you want to They're like 100 years old Maybe that's your thing I actually And maybe we are saying look up on her to do that Yeah you should have done that a lot sooner You could also do it like a lot more time Let's go Let's go That's not come on track She made this whole theater killbots for us Hey what about that There's an exit door Maybe it leads to the roof or something There's only one way to find out Let's go Let's go Hello Come on Go Ready I need you to be ready You ready Giving Come on Say the fuck back We know it's you Kirby Home One of them knocked me out What are you doing Did you kill you Kill my daughter Whatever he's been saying to you don't listen to him He's probably the killer Great job Of you You of course me Frankly I expected more from the two of you after what you did to us What do you mean us Mindy was right It was easy to drop the roommate lottery I mean all I had to do to meet you was room with the conceited condescending alpha literally named Chad Fuck It felt good to kill him This is your grandmother Sam Nancy Loomis really runs in fucking family doesn't it Speaking of family wait for it My names not Ethan Landry isn't that Dad wait If it's you two that just leaves Mindy You didn't see that one coming to dance Yeah because you die You've kind of done it so There's a good way to get off the suspect list Stab kill Weathers staff meeting on the train that sort of thing Yep and I just made sure I was first on the scene so I could switch your body up with the freshman A little fake blood prosthetic You'd be amazed at what a grieving father can get away with Christmas It was my favorite That's #3 That's two These Your fathers This is what we've been counting down to Sam I'm gonna need you to put it on Don't you What is this You did this as a family Hell yeah Bitch You should know better than anyone they're still not getting it Look I don't know what you believe but I didn't commit those murders in Woodsboro It wasn't me We know that Of course you did What do you think this is based on some bullshit conspiracy theory Come on who do you think started the rumors about you in the first place You know how easy it was to turn Sam from the hero of Woodsboro into the villain How easy it is to convince the world to believe the worst in people rather than the best Because it's not enough to just kill someone these days you have to assassinate the character first So when dad here discovers you're horribly mutilated body post with Sam where her father's mask he'll say some port on bastard right on the Internet that you're the real ghost face and took matters into their own diluted hands Exactly That's why it's the perfect alibi and all the best lies based on the truth Near a killer just like your father No I'm not Yes you are You motherfucker You killed our brother What are you talking about You said your brother died in a car accident No no no no Just something He died in Woodsboro Hands of your bitch sister You're Richie's family Yeah Now it wasn't until I saw that photograph of what you actually done to him that I knew and I knew you had to fucking die You have to be punished along with anyone else who stands in our way There she is There's the fucking killer over parenting job by the way Shut your whore fucking mouth I've got a perfect dad No And then maybe overindulge Richie's love of these little movies Maybe For me they're just a little dark We should Really He made a few of his own Did you know So you guys are thinking Nice There's a very special bond between a father and his first son Which is why I helped him build this collection This On his yes is a very passionate collector He inspired others We had to kill those two wannabe film students because well We have to kill you first huh I put the theater in their name Then good old Detective Bailey would have just stumbled on it But I didn't have to because by golly that GAIL Weathers is 1 hell of a journalist I built a tribute to my son Which is why this is where you have to die Sam Surrounded by all the things he loved the most What happens next What After you're done with us What you just disappear No I've gotta hurry over to the hospital Make sure Mindy and GAIL don't pull through because everybody dies Everyone who had anything to do with the death of my son suffers and dies Beyond the mask He was Sup That's not true Yeah Your son He was a man baby who made his girlfriend do all the killing He was a strong federal young man He was a limp Dick little fuck who cried before he slit his throat OK Recognize this Yeah Alright I kind of need this Are you gonna do about it bitch Find Sam I'll get help Careful Stick something in you Tara Out You guys are so fucked now Sam Yeah
