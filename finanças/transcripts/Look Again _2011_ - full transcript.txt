Time's up. Results will be mailed in approximately 3 weeks. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How'd you do? - I don't know. No matter how hard I study, I always feel like I've done horribly. I know what you mean. I'm sure I failed. No, you didn't! Thanks for helping me study, Allison. I couldn't have done it without you. - Yes, you could. - I know! We should go out tonight. It's on me. I'm exhausted. My mind is one big tangle of mortgage rates and amortization tables. Look, no excuses! We're going to Slink! OK, what exactly is Slink? Only the hottest nightclub in Chicago since last night. Besides, you remember the most important word in real estate. Location! - OK, second most important: networking. Clubs like that are full of contacts, prospects, people. You know, perfect for brilliant young up and comers like ourselves. Brilliant young up and comers who aren't actually realtors. Yet! It has cute guys. I have a cute guy. All right, don't rub it in. I know he's at a home show, so you can't use that excuse. Come on! We worked hard! We deserve this! You know what? You're gonna be really good at selling real estate. I'll pick you up at 8:00. Yes! ♪ ♪ Excuse me... Ahh! This place is packed! - I know. - Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Cheers! - Cheers! Oh! It's so good! How's the home show going, by the way? Zach says so far, so good. He's made some contacts, even a few orders. He's gonna be a zillionaire. You won't even need to work. Ah! But I wanna work. Of course you do! Speaking of which, how's it going with Myra Banning? - She is amazing! - You are so lucky! She's mentored some of the best realtors. It's Zach! Hey, you! The test? Um... It was tough, but I think it went OK! I'm out at a club with Nancy. Hello! It's fine, except you're not here! Really? Oh my God, that's great! What time do you think you'll get in? OK. I'll come by later. I can't wait to see you! Bye! He's coming back early! - Oh... - Um... Can you get home without me? Look at this place! I'm sure I can manage. I wanna get there early and surprise him! - You have a key? - Yes! Even a drawer. Part of a closet. Ooh! Sounding serious to me! Mmm! - Bye. - Bye. Don't get into too much trouble. - I won't. Have fun. - Bye. Zach? Are you here? Ahh! Please! No, please! Please! - No, please, please! - Shut up! - No! - You wanna die, babe? Huh? Is that it? - Zach! - Allison? Zach! Hey! - Zach, no! - Stop! Zach, he has a knife! Zach! Oh God! Zach! - Ahh! - No! Zach! No! Zach! Look at me. Zach! No! Zach! No! No! Somebody help! We can finish this later if that's easier. No. You have to find the man who did this. You have to find out who killed Zach! - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm sorry. Don't be. You said you got here at around 11:00? Yes. And your boyfriend was a contractor. Yes. He called me and told me he was coming home early. So I came here to surprise him. Everything looked fine. And then I went into the office and it was a mess. And that's when he grabbed me. Burglary in progress. You came in. He panicked. We need to figure out if anything was taken. You have any personal items here? - Yes. - Anything missing? Some jewellery. A ring... A necklace... a necklace that Zach gave me! Oh God... Oh God, he killed Zach! We've got a footprint from the backyard. Size 11. Looks to be a high-end running shoe. Very distinct pattern on the sole. And from the depth of the impression, I'd say about 180 lbs. This is good. This is good. Thank you. How did it go with the sketch artist? I tried, but I just didn't see anything. It was dark, the hood... We'll have you look at some mug shots. So, how about body size? Type? He was tall... 6'0", I guess. Normal build. He was so strong. You mentioned something about smells. His cologne... He wore a lot of it. There was a liquor smell, a sweet smell... and cigarettes. You said he spoke to you. You heard his voice? I'll never forget it. "You wanna die, babe?" Oh my God... He called me "babe"! You see, it's coming back to you, bit by bit. You know what? I think we have enough for now. You should go home, try to get some rest. Ah! Ugh... Hi, you've reached Allison. Please leave a message. Myra Banning's office. I'm sorry, he's on the phone right now. I'll have him call you back. OK, thanks. You send out the Hawthorne escrow papers yet? Oh... Oh, honey, I told you they needed them by tomorrow. I'm so sorry. Are you sure you didn't come back too soon? It's better here. At home it's all I think about. Are these your test results? Yeah, I guess so. Well, if you're not gonna look at them, I am! Ugh! I knew I shouldn't have let you take that exam. Now that you're a bona fide agent, I'm gonna lose the best assistant I ever had! One who forgets to do what she's told! I'll run these to the messenger. Great. I'll be back in an hour. And hey... congratulations! Thanks. Mm-hmm... Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll call you tomorrow, babe. You wanna die, babe? No! Ah! Ah! Um... is Myra Banning in? Mark? Allison I'd like you to meet... Myra, can I talk to you in your office, please? Uh, just have a seat. I'll be right out. Myra, I have to talk to you. What's wrong? - That man outside... - Allison, what... - It's him! - What? The man who broke in, who killed Zach! Out there right now! His voice, how he walks, how he moves. It brought it all back! - What are you saying? - Call the police! - Allison! - It's him! I know it's him! Allison, that's my nephew! He's here from college. He flew in last night. I picked him up at the airport. Aunt Myra? I'll be out in a minute. Oh... Are you gonna be all right? Oh, sweetheart... I have to go. - Hi, Nancy. - Guess what I'm holding. I'll give you a little hint: It comes from the Real Estate Board of Illinois. Yeah... I got mine this morning. I guessed as much. You know what this means! We are going to celebrate. I... I can't. Oh, come on! You don't return my calls! I haven't seen you since the funeral. I know you're in pain, but, you know, I just wanna help. I know. It's just too soon. What happened to you that night was horrible, which is why you can't live in that moment for the rest of your life. You know, I'm not giving up on you, Allison. Bye. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer. If you can't afford one, one will be provided to you. Do you understand these rights? Hello? Allison, Detective Marshall. I know it's late. I'm sorry. But you're gonna wanna hear this. We got him! We have him on 4 home burglaries. He was violent with 2 of the victims. He has a record of assaults, usually with a knife. Most of the break-ins were in the area of Zach's house. Could he stand up? Stand up. You heard the lady. Stand up. Stand up! Put his hood on. Bring him closer to the glass. Come on. Give it to him. Read it. "You wanna die, babe?" Again! "You wanna die, babe?" OK, get him back in his cage. I'm sorry. I just can't be sure. It's OK. I don't want you to lie. In any case, with the testimony of the other victims, we have enough to put him away. But I'm not gonna give up on finding evidence on Zach's murder. He belongs in prison. I'm certain we have the right man. You really think it's him? In my experience, the most likely suspect is usually the guilty one. But how can you be sure? We can't, not for now. But like I said, I'm not giving up. In the meantime, go home, get your life back. We'll be in touch. - Thank you, Detective. - You're welcome. Great news. They accepted the offer! I'm gonna need you to sign some contracts. Oh, let's say around 10:00 tomorrow morning? Great. I'll meet you at your office. Thanks. Do you ever come up for air? Oh! I trained with you, didn't I? You're doing great, honey. You said the first 6 months were the hardest. We're a week past that, and it still hasn't let up. I lied... just to keep you! You didn't really think I'd leave, did you? Well, the thought did cross my mind. Oh, and Nancy called. She said you hadn't spoken for a while. You two were pretty good friends, weren't you? Yeah. Friends are a good thing right now. - Oh! - Oh God! You scared me! Hi. Hi. Myra told me you were here. Hey. I called you a few times, but you didn't answer. So I figured you needed some more time. Listen, I hope you don't mind me stopping by like this, but I saw Myra at an open house and she said that I should come and see you and... It wasn't you. I couldn't talk about it. With anyone. You reminded me of that night. - Oh God! - I'm really sorry. Don't be sorry! Oh my God, if something like that happened to me, that would put me over the edge. I just wanted to help you. You look great. Thanks. Somehow or another, I managed to get a job at Stafford Keach Realty! - The Stafford Keach? - Yeah! Wow! I'm impressed. He's a tough boss, but I'm learning a lot. I mean, no wonder he's the most successful real-estate guy in the city. He never stops. He drinks coffee to slow down! And... I met someone. What, you mean like "someone" someone? Nancy, that's great! I'm happy for you! What's the matter? I don't know. I just... I feel so funny... that with everything that's happened... and you and Zach... No. I'm happy for you. I am. Look, no excuses. You're coming to my place for dinner. Actually, our place. Wait, you hate to cook. He cooks. I got him totally trained. How does tomorrow sound? Oh, why don't you stop by the office first? OK. No. No. No, I never said that, Paul. Right. If you use the word "synergy" one more time, Paul, I will detonate your Bluetooth from here. And believe me, I can do it. The word that I want to hear is "equity". Hold on. Hi, Stafford Keach. I know. Allison Brown. I'm here to see Nancy Cross. Paul, stop counting euros and get with me on this, I'll call you back Allow me, Allison Brown. Come. She wore Pumas. I almost fired her, I swear to God! Nancy, this lovely lady is here to see you. Allison, hi! Yeah. Joe! Hey, it's about time. Hold on a second. Have someone get this young woman something to drink. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. Where the hell is Mike? He's at a property. He'll be back any minute. Get him in my office the moment he gets here with the Wasco deed and an explanation as to why I'm getting negative calls about it. Will do. - Talk to Martin? - Stafford Keach. Wow! Told you. Tough. But that's how he teaches. - What can I get you to drink? - I'm fine. If Stafford says you want a drink, you want a drink. I'm fine, really. Decline at your peril. I'm afraid I'll be a while. I'm swamped. I may have to wait till Mike gets back, anyway. Mike, by the way, is my guy, the one. Take a seat. It shouldn't be too long. Uh... Mike, Allison. Allison, Mike. - Hello. - Hi. Nancy tells me you're gonna be joining us for dinner. Yes, thank you. Keach wants to see you about the Wasco deed. He sounds a little upset. That's not exactly news, is it? It's very nice to meet you. You too. - Later, babe. - Bye. Babe... Allison? Is there a restroom? Yeah, it's right there. Allison, you OK? Yeah. I'll be right out. OK. Hey, are you sure you're OK? I tried to tell you. No, you needed to check with me! - You were busy. - Don't let it happen again! Sometimes they don't see eye to eye. Mike has his own way of doing things. I guess it's different in LA. - LA? - Yeah. Mike just moved here from LA. Why? What is wrong? Out with it, girl. Nothing. Ready? Yes! I have him totally housebroken. Not quite. You're in charge of the salad. Oh, I was afraid you'd say that. My mom and dad are totally scandalized, of course, Mike living here and all. But when he moved into town, he had to take the first thing he could get. It was not great. You know, if I can master real estate, you'd think I'd be able to chop a tomato. Really? And as usual, Rick is late. Rick? Yeah, sorry, Mike's friend, Rick Palmer. I invited him for dinner. He's an artist. You'll love him. OK, is there any kind of salad you can eat with a spoon? And that would be the late Mr. Rick Palmer. I'm gonna get it. - Hey, Rick. - How you doing? Good. Rick, my best friend, Allison Brown. Allison, Rick Palmer. - Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. Delilahkept me. It's OK. Who's Delilah? One of my new paintings. A portrait. Rick is incredibly talented. I try. Well, why don't you try and eat your dinner? OK. OK, this one is for Allison. Oh, nice. ♪ ♪ Chopin. Nocturnein C sharp minor. - Very good. - Are you a fan? Yeah, I am. Well, I never knew anything about classical music until I met Allison. I just used to call it "that dead guy music." Remember? Here we go. Limoncello. A little after-dinner drink from Southern Italy. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone, a toast to friendship. Friendship. It's OK, I didn't like it at first when I tried it. OK. Verdict? He's very charming. And he has a future, I think. Stafford's been mentoring him for a while. I thought you said he just moved here from California. No, I meant permanently. He's been going back and forth a lot. So, he was here a few months ago? Yeah. Even before that. Why? Nothing. I just misunderstood. Thank you so much for dinner. Oh, sure. So, what about Rick? He's pretty nice too, huh? He is. Hoped you'd like him. Am I too obvious? What you are is a good friend. OK, don't be a stranger. - OK. - Bye! So, the listing we're gonna be at today is in the same development as the one you just sold. The interior has been staged to sell, but the landscaping isn't done yet, so we're gonna have to push the potential. And in the meantime, why don't you tell me what's wrong? What do you mean? Something's on your mind. I can tell. Remember that day when I thought your nephew was the one who broke into Zach's house? Of course I do. You scared me. We never talked about it. I figured with time we would. Sometimes, I get the feeling like it's not really over. I told you, honey, a trauma like this can take years... No, I feel like he's still out there. Except they found him. I mean, they did, didn't they? I think so. You think so? I know. It's ridiculous. But sometimes, like with your nephew, I'll see someone: the way he moves, the way he walks, his voice. That word: "Babe." I can't get it out of my head. You know, they have groups for this. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Maybe you should go. Yeah... Maybe. It'll take a while for you to feel like your old self. I may never. Well, then a new self. A stronger self. I mean, look what you've done with your work! I'm so proud of you. You've come so far! Besides, if someone were out there and thought you'd recognize him, he'd... What? Try to stop me from saying something? Come on, let's go sell that house! Today's the day! I can feel it! Fantastic. I'll call you when I get back to the office. OK, bye. Well, we must have done something right. That was Phil at Coburn Realty. We might have an offer! I think it was the cookies. Gotta get back to the office. Can I give you a lift? Nancy wants to have dinner. She's picking me up here. Oh, good. I'm glad you two are getting together. Have a good time. - Thank you. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night, Myra. - Ciao! Allison. Ah! - Hi. - Ah... I'm sorry. I thought Nancy was coming. She's running a bit late. She asked me to come get you. Am I that big of a disappointment? - No, of course not. - Good. We'd better go then. Nancy's gonna be waiting at the restaurant. I hate being late. Where's the restaurant? She reads the reviews in the Tribune. She keeps picking all these obscure places. Do you mind? Um, I'd rather you wouldn't, actually. No problem. I didn't know you smoked. Only when Nancy's not around. She hates it. That's the nice thing about separate cars. Where are we? Dammit! Why are we in such a hurry? Could you please slow down? Sorry. What? Well, the reason why I brought you here tonight is... I'm just gonna say it. Mike proposed. We're getting married! Look! Look! It's beautiful! - Thank you! - Wow! When? Um, we haven't set a date. Did we set a date? - No, not yet. - No. We didn't set a date. I'm happy. For both of you. - Thank you. - That's great. I'm so excited! Excuse me, I should take this. OK. I was so excited to tell you! Oh, Nancy, congratulations. - Thank you. - Really. Thank you. I'm really happy. So, um, have you told your parents yet? No, not yet. But I will. Thank you. And what about Mike's family? He was given up for adoption. Bounced around foster homes. So there's no one really to tell there. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - He's perfectly open with it. It's just sad. Look, I'm sorry, that was Stafford. He wants to go over the Wasco deed again. At his place. Dessert just got here. Can't it wait? - You know Stafford. - Yes. Can you take Allison back? Yes, I can take Allison back. Come here. Bye. - Bye. - Drive safe. I will. Congratulations. Thank you for dinner. You're very welcome. Do you mind if we stop by my office first? - Oh, of course not. - OK. You're a much better driver. Hmm? Yeah, I've talked to Mike about that. We're thinking of buying a house, Mike and I. Really? We're ready to make an offer. We got our own mortgage broker. The numbers look great. Take a look. OK, I'm going to run to the ladies room, and then we're off. The loveliest burglar I've ever seen! Nancy forgot something. She's in the restroom. There must be an epidemic of amnesia. We didn't bring the right papers either. This is a completely unnecessary visit. - Oh! Is it morning already? - It will be soon enough. Come on, Mike. Let's get to work. Mike! I'll see you at home, hon. You ready to go? Ready when you are. Ah! Hey! Uh... Rick. Mike Caldon's friend. - Hi. - Hi. A neighbour said you were last seen headed this way with a rather ambitious mound of laundry. If that's your laundry, I have enough of my own! No, this is actually one of Nancy's dead guys. Ah, Mahler. Mahler in a bag. Got it at a music shop. Do you like him? Very much. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, he's a little on the grim side. Only his later stuff. I wonder if... Mahler had to sort his own laundry. What do you think made him so grim? Anyway, it's music to do laundry to! You know what? I think you've earned a cup of coffee. Interested? Very much. I grew up in San Diego. My dad was Navy. And I think, honestly, that he wanted me to go that route. But funny thing, I get seasick. Not really. It just wasn't for me. I mean, art was always my passion. Um, and then, Mike and I went to high school together and went our separate ways and ran into each other here in Chicago. Are you guys very close? Not like we once were. I mean, friendships, they come and go. But he was there for me during some dark days. - Dark days? - Yeah. We all have them. Don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Life wouldn't be worth living without a little catastrophe every now and then. I just wish they were smaller, like a bunch of little catastrophes as opposed to one great big one. I like that. Catastrophe light! ♪ ♪ So, every time I try to tell my mother I want a small, casual wedding, she invites another dozen family members I've never even met. My God, at this rate, we're gonna have to rent Wrigley Field! You OK? You know I want what's best for you, right? Sure. Allison... Can we talk? That's probably a good idea. Come. Ok, so, shoot. What's up? How well do you know Mike? Enough to know that I love him. Why? Listen, if there's something wrong... Did you know he has a police record, Nancy? I looked him up online. Why? I was concerned. Suddenly you got the urge to see if my fiancé had a police record? - Did you know? - Yes. The records were sealed because he was a juvenile. What happened? What'd he do? OK. It was high school. Some kid was bugging him. Mike got angry. He, you know, let him have it maybe a little too hard and the parents pressed charges. How do you know this? He told me. So, you don't know for sure. Why are you asking me this? I just want you to be sure. - Sure about what? - About Mike. About what you're getting yourself into. Sweetie, look, I know you've been through a lot. I mean, we haven't really even talked about it, the Zach thing. You know, it must have been hell. But I think maybe... you're not over it. I'll never be over it! No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was that it kind of has... And not like I'm blaming you, but it kind has you on the defensive. Maybe. Look, what I told you before, if that happened to me, that would have put me over the edge. I don't know how I would trust the world again. But I trust Mike. I do. And you are my best friend in the whole world, and you need to trust me. - OK. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - OK. Mmm! Shall we? - Do we have to? - We have to. Ten new messages. Hey, Allison! It's Rick Palmer. I hope this isn't being too presumptuous, but there's a thing going on at the Philharmonic on Wednesday, and I have tickets, and well, look, you don't have to, but if you want... Look, this is sounding really dumb. Anyway, if you want, just give me a call. My number is 312-555-0197. OK, bye. End of final message. Hello? Hello? This isn't funny. If you don't stop calling, I'm calling the police! Thanks for coming in. Are you sure this is OK? Yeah. Thanks for calling me. Things we took from Zach's house that we don't need for the investigation anymore. Might be of sentimental value, might just be hurtful. I thought I'd let you make that decision. It's over. Is it? What do you mean? I still have this feeling... like I'm not safe. It hasn't been that long. I've worked with victims who felt the effects of a violent crime for years. Someone keeps calling me and hanging up. I tried to star-69 it, but it was blocked. Might just be a wrong number or kids playing with a phone. Or someone trying to scare me. I had this feeling yesterday like I was being followed. Do you have any idea who that person might be or why they'd be doing it? No. No. Not unless Zach's killer was still out there. Well, that's not much to go on. But OK, I'll try to find out who's been calling you. Thanks. And thanks for this. Hello? Hi, it's Allison Brown. Hey! I was hoping you'd call. Have you given any thought to Wednesday night? It's the Philharmonic. Actually, that's why I'm calling. Great! So I'll pick you up at 7:00. Oh... uh, sure. Well, I really hope you enjoyed it. I loved it. I'm so glad I came. Where exactly are we going? Well, there's someone that I'd like you to meet. Here we are. Oh, thank you. And this is Delilah. The one who made you late for dinner! Yes! You remembered! A demanding wench, she was! I've never been introduced to a painting before. It's a phase. The portraits, I mean. It's not the women. It's about the mood each one conveys. I like to think that each one tells her own story. This... is Winnifred. Winnifred? Mmm, she's not crazy about the name either. And this... Well, this is Patricia. Wow... She's beautiful. Sorry, Rick. That gentleman over there is asking about Barbara. Oh, thank you. Here we go. This is the collision of art and commerce. I'll just be a minute. Susan, Allison. Allison, Susan. This is her place. Nice to meet you. I love what you've done here. It was always my dream to open a gallery one day. But my partner preferred a coffee house. And suddenly it occurred to me, why not combine them? He's so talented. Have you known Rick long? No, we just met, really. Well, it's good to see him with someone. Oh, we're not... Oh, no, no, I just meant out in the world with people. I've gotten to know Rick. He's, uh... He's gone through a lot. Really? That was a false alarm. He's only looking. Hmm. Oh, refills, on the house. It was nice meeting you. You too. Oh wow! It's impressive! Yeah, Nancy turned me on to it. I rent it from her boss. Oh... Stafford Keach. Hmm. One of his many developments, I'm sure. Hmm? So, I don't limit myself to one medium. Sculpture is relatively new to me. And this one... Hmm... This is a work in progress. I like it. Yeah? It's funny, I can't tell if it's done. - You know what I think? - What? It's done. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm, I do. Great! You just saved me a ton of work! It's done! Can I touch? Please. Wow!

Promise? Two things I dread every year: My dental exams and Stafford's annual schmooze fest. Stafford! Darling, what a lovely party! I look forward to it all year long! No wonder we were never business partners. You lie so unconvincingly. Only because you take the truth so inelegantly. Don't worry, we've been sparring for years. Don't you dare tell her how many! - I'm so glad you came, Allison. - Thank you. It's a lovely party. Oh, it was the moment you arrived. Allison broke into my office. What? It's a joke. She was with Nancy. And it seems that everyone had forgotten something that night. I hope that you found what you were looking for. I did. Thank you. Good. Oh, excuse me. Hi. Hello. Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, thank you. Nancy told me that you were looking me up online. Nancy's my friend. Do you always look up information about your friends' significant others? No. Then why me? I'm not sure I have to answer your questions. You know, Allison, I wish that we could start over. I wasn't aware we'd started at all. She talked about you a lot. And I felt like I knew you before we'd even met. Really? I had the same feeling about you. Well, have we? What? Met before. Maybe you could tell me. You don't like me very much, do you? I don't really know you, one way or another. But we could try... getting to know each other, I mean, for Nancy's sake. She's very fond of you. Well, I'm very fond of her. She told me about Zach. It's a terrible thing. I remember when it happened. - Really? - Yeah. What exactly do you remember? Stafford and I were working an all-nighter on the Wasco deed, holed up at his country club. We were shocked when we found out. Stafford knew Zach? Yes, he did. I'm sorry. I've upset you. Where have you been? I need you to talk to Ron Spencer, the Portland project. He is one martini away from a deal. That is, if I'm not interrupting. Nothing that we can't finish later. Mike has potential. But I force him to polish it on a daily basis by offering the appropriate amount of abrasion. Is that what business is? Abrasion? No. That's what life is. Mike mentioned you knew Zach. Of him. Yes. Hey, man! He was a fine contractor. I was so sorry to hear what happened. You know, I was hesitant to bring it up. Mike also mentioned that you and Mike were together the night it happened. Come to think of it, yes, we were. It was a terrible night for you. Yeah, it was. I better see how he's handling Ron Spencer. Will you be OK? Yeah, of course. Stafford spares no expense. You should've seen the parties his wife threw! You weren't anybody if you weren't invited to a soiree given by Margaret Keach. - She passed away? - Yeah. Way too young. One of those really fast cancers 2 years ago. It devastated him. You've known Stafford for a long time, haven't you? Yeah. Hmm... We were more than friends at one point. Really? Yeah. It was after Margaret passed away. I wanted to be comforting. So, we'd meet and he'd talk. He'd tell me his pain. We'd have dinner at his club. - His club? - Yeah, his private club. It's very elegant, very exclusive. Oh... Yeah, he mentioned that he was there with Mike the night Zach got killed. This is me. You can just drop me off at the corner. Thanks for the lift. No problem, honey. - Hi. - Hi. Wow! That looks amazing. Here. Wow. Mmm! Chocolate... Ah, it's almost the most perfect thing. They say there's a chemical. It creates a feeling of euphoria. - Is that what it is? - Mm-hmm. Today's Zach's birthday. Last year I took him out to his favourite restaurant and then we went bowling. He said it was the perfect day. I hate bowling! But for that one day, nothing could have made me happier. I haven't talked about it much, about what happened. I didn't wanna ask. Things happen. They take you away from yourself, your life. I know. The other night... I hope I wasn't... No, no. It was good. Let me know when she gets back. Hi! Hi! I know you never stop working... but lunch! I brought some disgustingly unhealthy food. - Um, sure. - Excellent. Hungry? - Not really. - Me either. Look... I wanted to apologize. For what? The party. I heard Mike was rude. We had some words. I'm sorry. Nancy... I have this feeling like someone's still out there, watching me. Maybe you're right, I'm on the defensive. It's just been a really terrible time. I know, honey. Hold on a second. Allison Brown. Yes, Mr. Gaynes, I spoke to the inspector. He'll be there in about an hour. OK, great. I'll meet you there. Bye. You're busy. I'm gonna go. Thanks. And thanks for this. I appreciate it. Though I suspect your reason was to clog my arteries with disgusting, greasy food! No! I love him, Allison. I do. He's good for me. I am happy for you, Nancy. I really am. Thank you. OK. Go on, be busy. Go. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. ♪ ♪ You remember me, don't you? Don't you? If you go to the police again, I'll come back. I promise! Get some shots of that. Hand me that kit. You know who it is, don't you? No. I think you do. Look... I can't help you if you don't level with me. You need to tell me everything, and you need to tell me now! Mike, I need you to take a look at this. Excuse me, may I help you? Yes, we're looking for Mike Caldon. I'm Mike Caldon. What is this about? Detective Jennifer Marshall. I gotta ask you some questions. What's going on? OK, just to make things really clear, where were you last night at approximately 10:00 p.m., Mr. Caldon? At the office. Really? That's rather late to be at the office? Not if you plan on being successful, Detective. This will go a lot easier without the attitude. I had a report to do. Were you alone? Yes. Nice shoes. What size are those? 11? Yeah. Why? I'm a curious girl. Do I need a lawyer? Why would you need a lawyer if you haven't done anything wrong? I haven't. And frankly, unless you think there's a reason why you can keep me, I'm leaving. And if you wanna talk to me again, you better have a warrant. Nancy! Nancy, talk to me! Why did you do this? OK, I repeat: Why did you do this? I was attacked! Threatened! Why in God's name would Mike wanna attack you? Why? From the first time I met him, I had this feeling. His cologne, it was the same kind. It scared me! A feeling! Really? Cologne? That's what this is about? I had a terrible feeling that he was the man who broke in that night. You really think that Mike killed Zach? Oh God, I don't know. You don't know. You have him hauled into the police department, and you don't know! Oh my God, what are you saying? I don't know for sure! I can't believe this! - He has a police record! - He was a kid! This is insane! Yesterday I told you I felt like I was being watched. Did you tell Mike what I said? Did you? Yes! So what? Where was he last night around 10:00? At work. You don't know that for sure. Yes, I do! I was with him. I thought... Oh my God, you're covering for him! He said he was alone. Just stop it, OK? Please. Come on. He says he didn't do it, of course. Which? Last night, the break-in or both? Both. He says he was at the office. Nancy says she was with him. But first he said he was alone. She says she came in later. He says he was mistaken. About his own alibi? Nancy's my friend, but she's lying. You don't know that for sure. - She's covering for him! - I had to let him go. What about the crank calls? The calls came from a disposable cell phone. Impossible to trace. We don't have enough to hold him. He made a fool out of me in there, and I brought him in on your word. - But I thought... - Look at me! You tell me right now. Are you sure? Are you 100% sure that Mike Caldon is the man that broke into your house last night? - Hey. - Hey. I heard what happened. I don't think that you should stay here alone. And I also think it's time you told me the whole story. OK. I'm sorry, I just... I wanted to help. I know. Um... I appreciate it, Nancy, I do. But you didn't have to. I know. I was alone. I was. Everything's gonna be fine. OK? - Mm-hmm. - We're gonna get through this. So, you think they arrested the wrong person. I don't know. That's just it. All I know is that ever since I met Mike, I have this feeling like whoever did it is back into my life. Attacking you or trying to stop you. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's just kind of hard to believe that Mike killed Zach Hartley. You know his name. Yeah. Uh, I guess I heard it. This is a lot to process. I mean, Mike's a friend. Rick? Rick? Rick! Are you all right? What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong. Please. Please. Leave me alone. Just please! Please, would you... Would you please leave me alone! Go! The Fremont house? Yes, I am. I guess it's not that far. I can be there in 15. OK. Thank you. Bye. Hello? Is somebody there? It's Myra Banning. I'm here to show the house. Hello? Susan... Oh, hi! Oh, Rick hasn't been in yet. That's funny. I was expecting him. Actually, I'm here to see you. Can you talk for a second? Of course. What about? I'm concerned about Rick. What do you mean? You mentioned that he'd been through a lot. What did you mean? How much has Rick told you? About his past, I mean. Not much. He grew up in San Diego, moved to New York. Mostly about his art. Hmm, come here. Her name isn't Patricia. It's Jane. She was Rick's wife. Was? She died. How? Now we come to Rick's dark days. They had an apartment in the Village, and she fell from an 8th-floor window. There was an investigation. And finally, it was ruled a suicide. Finally? Rick was in the apartment, in his studio, working. Naturally, there were accusations. And he started to drink as a way to deal with it. It nearly destroyed him. But he seems to be in a much better place nowadays. He, uh... I mean, he's... he's been sober for a while, but it's more than that. He seems happy. You know about my friend Zach, right? Yes. I am so sorry. Did Rick know him? Very well. Not so much after the falling out. What do you mean? Well, Zach had arranged to feature some of Rick's paintings in a line of luxury buildings. It was a pretty big deal. But it fell through. Rick was really upset about it. They had a pretty big row over it. Chicago PD. Det. Jennifer Marshall, please. She's not in. Can I take a message? Never mind. Allison, I'm afraid I have some bad news. It's about Myra. A workman found her body at the bottom of the steps. Oh God! Myra... The last call she received was untraceable. You think... We don't know. It could have been an accident, but some things about it bother me. We're going over the scene right now. In the meantime, we need to look around her office for appointments, messages. My boyfriend dies in a burglary. My boss falls down a flight of stairs. My God, who's doing this? If you're thinking about Mike again, his alibi checks out the night of Zach's murder. He was with Stafford Keach at Stafford's club. And the attack on me? Another botched burglary? The jewelry that was stolen from me, the necklace that Zach gave me, would whoever did this hang onto it? It'd be foolish and certainly incriminating. Why? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing in here? This is my stuff! These are my things! - You have no right to be in here. - Let go of me. You break into people's houses and go through their things? Why didn't you tell me you knew Zach? Why do you have all that jewelry? Allison, wait! And that's when he fell. Are you hurt? I'm fine. Do you wanna file a complaint? We can book him for assault. He had my necklace. Yes, that's right. My client says the septic-tank issue wasn't disclosed. I'll fax you what I have. Look it over and get back to me. Thank you. Hi. I don't know what to say. Me either. I'm really sorry. - Tell that to my clients! - Mike... No. You know what? Let's get this out right now. - I know how you must feel. - No, you don't. Do you have any idea how this is gonna affect my reputation? It's a matter of time until I get cancellations. Mike, stop it. Just stop! - Allison... - No! Don't do that! Allison! Allison, wait! Allison... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I should have been more understanding. I should have told you. Told me what? Mike and Mr. Keach, they were talking about Rick, you and him getting together. They were talking about his past and what happened. What do you mean? They knew he was trouble. I should have said something to you. I'm so sorry. We can start over again, Allison. We can get through this. I should get going. Hello? Allison? Jennifer Marshall. Rick Palmer's been released. What? There's just not enough to hold him. And I have to be honest, your accusation against Mike didn't help. I see. Lunatic woman blames the world at large. Is that it? Look, I'm gonna do everything I can. In the meantime, do you have somewhere else to stay? You really think I need to? Just to be safe. Yeah, I have a friend. I'll call her. OK, good. Let me know when you get there. I will. Thanks. Thanks. That, uh... That was Rick. The police have let him go. Really? Yeah. I... I... I was thinking maybe we should postpone the wedding for a bit, until things blows over. What are you saying? Well, just with everything happening, I think it's just a better idea. You know what? Just stop, OK? 'Cause it's her, isn't it? - What? - That... She's got you so turned inside out that you think her happiness is more important than ours. You don't know what you're talking about. You're afraid of me, aren't you? I cannot believe this. I have not done anything wrong. Is that why I had to lie to the police? I never asked you to do that. Shhh! Stop it, stop it! I'm not gonna hurt you! A second later and he might have killed you. Stay away from me. Oh, Allison, is that any way to talk to the man that just saved your life? I don't believe he was gonna hurt me. He had you in his arms, Allison. It looked like a struggle to me. I mean, that's what the police are gonna think. Don't come near me. Oh, Allison, you know what? This isn't the way I wanted it to play out. The police thought that Rick did it. He just attacked you in the garage, and I had to stop him because he had a gun. And he had to silence you. And I got here just a minute too late to stop him from killing you. You're just too curious. Digging around in my past and finding out about my arrest. I mean, I was 16. You know the cliché: "Bad home, bad boy." Right? It was kids stuff! Now, does that give you any right to start screwing around with my life? You turned Nancy against me. What about Zach? Was that kids stuff too? That was your fault. If you hadn't have shown up when you did, I would've been long gone by the time Zach showed up. You know what? I never meant to hurt him. Why? Why Zach? He was causing problems. I had to protect myself. Just like I have to right now. Leave her alone. You know what? You don't know when to stay down, do you? Rick! Rick... Are you OK? I'm gonna go make a statement downstairs. Please call me before you leave. Yeah, of course. I can't believe he almost got away with it. Yeah, break in at Zach's, his death... What is it? Something doesn't add up. The night you were attacked in your apartment, it turns out Mike did have an alibi after all. How? The security system at Stafford's office. Mike's ID card checked out for the time he said he was there. He couldn't have attacked you that night. How can that be? Maybe this will help. What is it? The case against the 16-year-old Michael Caldon. We were able to get the file unsealed. It has his whole history, including the adoption. There's some things you need to know. Well, well. If it isn't the relentless Allison Brown. I think you'd better talk to me. Little early, isn't it? Well, this has, uh... all been very upsetting. It's difficult losing Mike. He was more than an employee. He was a friend. It's also difficult losing a son. I know everything. You and Margaret gave him up for adoption when you were 16. You hired a detective to find him after she died. She cried out for him the whole time that she was sick. Regret, it's a terrible thing. You know, it eats your heart. I had to find him. Did Mike ever know? No, I made him think that he was just a protégé. And then that awful thing with Zach. Why did Mike break in to Zach's that night? One of Zach's workers was killed on one of my projects. Zach accused me of covering it up. He insisted that he had proof. So Mike broke in to his place to find it and tried to make it look like a robbery. And you and Zach got in the way. The irony is that he had no proof. And the attack in my apartment, Mike had an alibi. It was you, wasn't it? I'm sorry. I... I had to protect him. And you planted the necklace so I would find it. Mike's crimes were impetuous, all right? They were stupid! I could have been destroyed! I had to protect both of us! At everyone's expense? Nancy's life? Rick? Mine? Myra? Myra... Myra knew that Mike wasn't with me the night that Zach was killed. She knew because I was with her. And Mike killed Myra, not me. It was just another dreadful, foolish act, and all for nothing. You know, I really wish that you would have just left well enough alone. Put the gun down, Mr. Keach! She told me her theory. I thought it was convincing. You've said what we need, sir. Put it down. I had no intention of hurting this beautiful young woman. I thought you knew where the key was. Can I come in? Rick, I'm really sorry. I really, really am. Well, then that makes two of us, because I should've told you that I knew Zach. I was afraid of what you might think. It doesn't matter now. I stopped by the café. Susan told me you were out of the hospital. She also told me you took down the painting of your wife. Patricia. Yeah, I miss her, but I think it's time to stop living in the past.
