In Florida, the prison system is the largest state employer, employing thousands of people. There are about 150 facilities, about 80,000 inmates, and even though Florida has about a 17% Black population, half of inmates are Black. I think a place like this that has such a long history of racial strife should not be surprising to anyone that the largest employer is also going to have members of the Klan in it.

And by that, I mean he had certain qualifications. Like what? CHRIS: Well, he had a military background. Physically, he sort of fit the bill. I mean, he's a white male. He was from--from that area. He could walk the walk. JOE: When I was growing up, I lived in a very swampy, rural part of town, and where I lived at, those people flew Confederate flags, those people used the N-word. - The FBI asked you to go undercover. What was your mission? JOE: My mission was go inside the KKK to identify people that are involved and to forewarn the FBI of any illegal activities. [gun shots] - Was there a threat in northern Florida at the time? Yes, clearly. [eerie music] GEORGE: KKK? CHRIS: The KKK has-- has the history, - the image, so to speak. - We do not... CHRIS: They're capable and dangerous. GREG: Florida has been a bastion of the Klan. I usually call the KKK the granddaddy of white supremacy movements because you can see the roots if you study the history. TAMEKA: The Klan was founded after the end of the United States Civil War by whites who were determined to maintain their supremacy. In 1921, it was estimated that there were approximately 100,000 Klan members across the United States. A full one-third of them were believed to have been in the state of Florida. African Americans living in the state of Florida have the highest likelihood of being lynched of any people in the United States. During the Civil Rights Movement, you're going to see a lot of these Klan members be active in confrontations of civil rights demonstrators. You see that very vividly in Saint Augustine, Florida, in 1964. JASON: Local leaders, officials, sheriffs were openly members of the Ku Klux Klan who ran these towns 100 or less years ago. So it's still a very active part of the culture and history of this region. GEORGE: And to do your job well, you have to make them believe you're one of them. How do you even start though? - So this wasn't my first time undercover for the FBI. Back in 2007, I spent about four years undercover for the FBI in a different Klan organization. - Joe walks into the FBI office in Gainesville, Florida to report what he thought was a crooked cop. The FBI agent saw Joe's military background, saw something in him and thought, "Here's someone we could recruit to help us out." - Initially, I wasn't surprised that they contacted me, but I was-- I was honored. I realized that I had a second chance to serve my country again. I had the opportunity to help someone else, just as I wished somebody was there to help me when tragedy happened to me as a child. GEORGE: But something went wrong there. They believed your cover had been blown? - The problem was my family issues. - Joe was under a lot of pressure and stress from his wife. JASON: There was some secret. Sooner or later, he came clean, and when the FBI discovered that he told his wife, they severed the relationship immediately. So he broke the rules? CHRIS: He broke a rule, he broke a rule, and a decision was made to sever ties. GEORGE: So if a guy breaks the rules once, why bring him back? CHRIS: Because it was, in a sense, almost understandable. JASON: This time, they were able to strike up a new deal where his wife would know from the beginning. CHRIS: You also consider the need to bring somebody in who already has that experience. The decision to reopen him, so to speak, was really an easy decision. [people shouting and chanting indistinctly] JASON: In 2013, there were more than 100 Klan groups operating in the United States. CHRIS: Really, the first year or so was, be on the lookout, gather intelligence, evaluate the threat. - I was learning how to be a part of that organization and getting close to them. This is the application to the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. And it simply asks, "Do you support white supremacism?" They want people that have skills. They want people from the military. The KKK has a formal structure similar to a military unit. The KKK has what is essentially a commander-in-chief in the Imperial Wizard. The governors of the regions would be the Grand Dragons, and the Grand Nighthawk would be that state or that region's leader of the National Guard. They use acronyms in order to ensure that impostors were not infiltrating the meeting or the Klan. They would use terms like AYAK, are you a Klansman? And the proper response, if you are a Klansman, is AKIA, A-K-I-A, a Klansman, I am. If you don't respond with AKIA, they know you're not a Klansman. They also have a blood oath. - Yes, they do. When you sign the blood oath, they tell you that if you violate or disclose secrets of the KKK, you'll pay with your blood. [tense music] ♪♪ ♪♪ GEORGE: What does it mean to be operational for the FBI? JOE: I was constantly in contact with the Klan, nearly on an hourly basis, transferring information, attending meetings. I perhaps, would be having dinner or lunch with my family, or at church or something, and we'd get a phone call, and I knew it was a Klan member. - The KKK, who did they think you were? - Someone far more qualified than myself. GEORGE: A warrior? JOE: Yes. [exhales deeply] My Zodiac sign is Gemini. Being the twins, there were two aspects of myself, one undercover, and one who I really was. - They were really interested in his military background and training as a sniper. He took on a character that inflated his credentials even further than what they already were. CHRIS: He took military experience and made it sound almost sexy to them. So he talked about being a sniper, alluding to killing people in Delta Force, which they clearly were attracted to. - I was able to rise through the ranks to the point that they made me a Nighthawk and, eventually, the Grand Nighthawk. - It's clear from his ascent that he impressed them. They trusted him. He displayed admirable patience throughout that process, which easier said than done, particularly in a situation like that that's potentially very dangerous. [Klansmen chanting] - So in his first year, Joe was leaking intelligence to the FBI here and there, but there were no major plans he's disrupting. But that would all change. It was the height of North Florida deep South summer, which anybody knows is one of the most humid, sticky, hot places. Many of the rooms inside the RMC are not air conditioned. It makes conditions even more tense between the inmates and the guards. Thomas Driver worked in the dorm area where Warren Williams was an inmate. They crossed paths at numerous times. But one day, Thomas Driver had brought Warren into a room inside the prison to reprimand Warren for losing his ID badge. Driver just smoking a cigarette, started blowing smoke at Warren's face. LATONYA: And he said he asked him to stop, and he wouldn't. You know, he kept saying, you know, "Get out my face with the cigarette smoke." You know, "Get out of my face. Get out my face." ANTWAN: They would do things, outrageous things, that push you in a corner, just things that just not necessary. JASON: Warren asked him to stop. Driver refused to stop, and it was at that point that Warren jumped on him, and the fight started. LATONYA: Warren and Driver was fighting, wrestling, you know, on the floor or whatever, and the other COs came in. They beating him. ♪♪ ♪♪ They beaten him so bad, they took him to the hospital. JASON: Williams had gotten the better of Driver in the fight, and during the fight, had also bit Driver and broken the skin, and Driver had required a series of tests to make sure that he didn't have some serious communicable diseases, hep C or HIV, and because of the worry over whether or not he'd picked up one of these diseases, he said it had caused his family immeasurable stress and that he just wanted this guy assassinated. ♪♪ ♪♪ So Warren was released from prison right around Christmas time and returned back to his mother's small home in Palatka. [soft dramatic music] He began working a landscaping job, trying to stay out of trouble. He was on probation, so he's going to regular probation meetings, fishing when he can, just trying to get his life back to a peaceful state, but at the same time, the Ku Klux Klan is plotting to snatch him up and murder him. JOE: I ask the question, "Do you want him 6 feet under?" And they said yes. I said, "OK, brothers, y'all enjoy the rest of the evening." Get in my vehicle, just running the night over in my head over and over and over. When I got safely down the road, I immediately called the FBI to tell them that these guys were prepared to murder. CHRIS: So December 6... everything about that meeting... was chilling. It's not illegal to engage in hateful speech. What is illegal is to go from hateful speech into the planning of a criminal act, a violent act. - And once he hears some talk about murder, that's when you need him to wear a wire? Yes. They've had this conversation in December. Now he has to go back, wearing a wire this time, and recreate important parts of that conversation. PAUL: It's invaluable to have those recordings to validate and corroborate exactly what the informant is telling us so that we know precisely the words used. PAUL: There are many hours and many meetings. Countless hours of him spending time talking with them so we could try to keep a good pulse of what were they thinking. CHRIS: If you've ever had a cotton ball and you try to pull it apart, if you pull too hard, it won't come apart. If you pull easily, it comes apart. That's what Joe Moore was able to do with this organization. CHRIS: He never pushed too hard. He would inquire, listen, go along with things. - It was obvious that they did harbor racial animosity toward the victim. - And the other thing that was apparent to me was there was absolute intent to see this carried out. PAUL: He's obviously interacting with and around people that have expressed a clear intent to commit murder. If it came out that Joe was cooperating and working with the FBI, we feared his-- his life could very well be in danger. - Joe was in danger. He also had a wife and kids. He did. With sources, it's a constant challenge and a struggle, particularly if they have family, if they're trying to lead a normal life. To have that going on on the side is--it's tough. - Make sure they're all the way over here, love. [indistinct chatter] GEORGE: When you're in it, how do you go from a cross burning at night to having breakfast with your kids the next morning? JOE: It's difficult. With whatever operation you're conducting with the FBI, you still have family life to deal with. ZOE: Lord, thank you for watching over us. I thank you for our many blessings. You know, I always say everything is for a reason. And we weren't together six months when we got engaged. About six months. - And we've been together 15 years. Yeah, yeah. [upbeat rock music] ♪♪ ♪♪ JOE: I have four children in total, one from a previous marriage. ZOE: Joe just told me that there was a man that they was wanting to kill and that this was gonna be some dangerous waters. He didn't even know what he was going to be stepping into, so I was always worried. - Good job, bud. Yeah. I would wonder about what would happen to my family if I was discovered all the time, every day, every second of being operational. - The burden that it put on me-- and it wasn't just me. It's our children. We were worried. Is he gonna be safe? Are we gonna be safe? [soft dramatic music] JOE: After the holidays, I got a call from Charles Newcomb that he wanted to go on a reconnaissance. JOE: It is Charles Newcomb who, in fact, did take charge of the overall operation and was essentially the puppet master of all the pieces that were moving. I was told by Charles Newcomb that we were going to surveil his location in order to further identify the plan to murder him. And I asked him if Brother David Moran would be attending. He said yes. And I said, "What about Brother Driver?" JOE: He said, "Brother Driver will be working that day." In the back of my head, I'm thinking, "You're making sure he is working on the day we're just doing reconnaissance." So there's a little red flag that popped up for me there. The morning I left my home, I had to secretly meet with the FBI. JASON: They had outfitted Joe's truck with numerous microphones. And Joe, of course, had a recording device as well. GEORGE: What would have happened to Joe had they discovered the wire? - On the surface, you would think they would probably react emotionally, violently. - Would they have killed him? - I think so. I showed up at Charles Newcomb's home. And I'm thinking, "OK, I have to hope for the best, but I have to expect the worst." JASON: The general plan was to case the area and get intelligence for a future drive. What he'd find out is that Newcomb had other plans. JASON: Injecting someone who's not diabetic with too much insulin poisons them. It kills them. - They were gonna take him out on the spot using those drugs. They also had thought ahead how to get rid of all the evidence. JOE: Yes. - So the fishing pole that day that they introduced was really to set the scene to make it look like it was a normal day, the victim was out fishing, and then he had had a medical condition collapse, and he was face down in the water. - So he puts the fishing gear in the back of my SUV, where some of the FBI equipment is. - And I'm thinking... - Don't open that. JOE: David Moran showed up, and there was an exchange of firearms. I was not able to inform the FBI of the intent of these guys to kill Mr. Williams. - It's easy to watch TV and believe the FBI is-- is everywhere and that they're-- that they're in vans down the street. The reality is the idea that we can have an immediate response-- it's just not feasible. Joe Moore was out there operating on his skills, on his instincts, on his ability to react. - They're talking through how they might even alternatively dispose of the body. JOE: The closer we got to Palatka, it's like these guys just-- Moran got more excited. Newcomb got more serious. JOE: When we pulled into Warren's neighborhood, there were people walking on the sidewalks, sitting outside their front doors. - Almost immediately, as we turn on to the road where Warren Williams lived, there was an obvious presence of law enforcement. CHRIS: Enough law enforcement presence was arranged in that area, visible, to dissuade them from doing anything rash and sudden. JOE: They told me law enforcement would be in the area, but I had no idea what the plan was. - Now, there's much that goes on in the background that we don't necessarily tell the informant. JOE: An unmarked vehicle showed up immediately and pulled right in behind us. I saw the expression on Newcomb's face. He was ready to jump into battle, and I'd be right in the middle of it. - You're thinking he could pull the gun out at any moment? Absolutely. CHRIS: While we're in control of parts of it there, we can't control Newcomb and Moran's reaction. And it does pose danger to Joe Moore. - I kept driving. I kept my mouth shut. I turned left, and that vehicle stayed right behind us. Moran kept turning around, watching them. JOE: We went around the block twice, and that patrol vehicle stayed behind us the whole time. Newcomb let out a breath of exasperation, as if he was getting even more pissed. JOE: It was like I almost had to have three eyes, one on Newcomb, one on the road, and one on Moran. I was thinking to myself, get myself under control, breathe, focus, observe. I put my hand on my sidearm. I turned right onto the highway and drove out, and that vehicle pulled over and did a U-turn. I thought to myself, "Thank God." However, Newcomb was very suspicious. - What they were planning to do became more and more shocking and disturbing. It was clear they wanted him killed. PAUL: And so what we needed to do was come up with an alternative so that it prevented them from taking independent action, and we can ensure the victim was safe at all times. LATONYA: Warren did, I think, almost a year in prison. And you know, when he came home, he told me, he said, "Mama, ain't nobody gonna ever hear my story." I was like, "OK. Well, sit down and tell me your story." [soft dramatic music] ♪♪ ♪♪ WARREN: I believe it was about three months into my sentence that I got into the incident with him.

They would kill him if they found that he was wearing a wire. ♪♪ ♪♪ JOE: I made messages for my wife and children. - In case something happened to you? Because every day, there's a chance I wasn't coming home. What were they? The last words that I felt they wanted to hear from me. ♪♪ ♪♪ GEORGE: So what happened when you showed them the phone? JOE: When I drove to meet with David Moran to show him the photo, I had a little bit of time to get into character slowly and think about what I had to do. ♪♪ ♪♪ Moran was known for being an extremely dangerous person, beating prisoners to within an inch of their life, and I was very worried about showing him the photo. He was excited and gleeful, and I thought to myself, "How disgusting can someone be?" But I just had to maintain my composure, maintain my character. - Don't interject, and let him do the talking. [engine turns over] JOE: It was upsetting, but I can't dwell on that. I can't quit. That's not an option. It's on me to make this case. JASON: At this point, Joe is so deep in this case. Even with all the stress, there's a job to finish. JOE: I met with Thomas Driver at a parking lot of a shopping mall in Lake City, Florida. Since this particular case started with him, it needed his approval. - If Thomas Driver had said that he didn't want the target, Williams, dead, the entire case would have fell apart. [chuckles] JOE: He appeared to get the blood that he wanted. When I got back into the vehicle... I felt a huge relief. [dramatic music] However, when I had to go meet with Charles Newcomb, that was probably the most intense meeting. ♪♪ ♪♪ He was certainly the ringleader and probably the most driven of the three. ♪♪ ♪♪ Newcomb was so meticulous and had an attention to detail. It was alarming. JOE: Charles Newcomb was perhaps most likely to ask a dangerous question. I expected him to ask, "Where's the body?" Because there's a guy murdered. We don't see anything about it in the news. Where's the body? I had to come up with a way to get him off of his normal thought processes. And I thought, "OK, what can I do?" I can pretend to be sick, had powder on my face to look like I was pale. He looked at me, and I kind of tried to look like I was tired and exhausted. - I keep telling myself, "Breathe, focus, listen, breathe, focus, listen." JOE: The moment where Charles Newcomb became happy with it, I thought to myself, "Thank God." I have reached that crest. But I had seen so many false peaks that I questioned myself, "Is this really the end?" REPORTER: Shocking case coming to light. Three KKK members, who are current and former Florida corrections... REPORTER: The Attorney General, Pam Bondi, was fired up about these arrests. Hey, guys. ANTWAN: Up at Charlotte Correctional, that's the prison I went home from, you know, the 6:00 news came on. So I'm like, "Man, what is that?" - Today, in conjunction with the FBI, three defendants were charged, all with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. ANTWAN: They showed the pictures of the officers. And I recognized chief. I said, "That's Chief. Man, what the hell?" And then I heard the story. PAM: All three were employees of the Department of Corrections and are known alleged members of the Ku Klux Klan. - So it was--[chuckles] I went through all the emotions sitting there watching this. I'm not gonna lie, my first thought was, "These guards, they done went crazy now." - And, again, no one has been convicted yet. These are pending charges, but the facts of this case are despicable. [soft dramatic music] ♪♪ ♪♪ WARREN: I saw that the officers had gotten arrested. I knew that everything had worked out. It was time for me to go back home. JOE: After Driver, Newcomb, and Moran were taken into custody... my wife, my children, and I were taken into protective custody. - The FBI had called us, and they said to get what you need and you have to leave. So fit everything that you can into your car, and that's it. ♪♪ ♪♪ JOE: It's an incredibly emotional feeling. But I had to struggle with this character that I had been for so many years. You try to get back to your life, but it becomes more and more difficult... to discard or insulate yourself from that character. ♪♪ ♪♪ - Joe being undercover for so long, it just--it takes a toll. I was ready to start over new. CHRIS: The arrests occur in April. And then two years later, a trial. Now Joe Moore is going to testify as the key state's witness. JASON: Driver got a reduced, four-year sentence after entering a guilty plea to a lesser charge. Both Moran and Newcomb stood trial for conspiracy to commit murder. LATONYA: We got in the courthouse. They had FBI agents there. They had so many polices there, and Warren, he was all right. He don't show a lot of emotions. He just hold 'em in. ♪♪ ♪♪ JOE: The defense in this case was not able to attack the facts of the case. They couldn't deny the fact of Williams as being the victim. The only thing they could attack was me. [tense music] ♪♪ ♪♪ - You got paid by the FBI? - Yes. How much? - For the 10-year span, somewhere over $100,000. GEORGE: And at the trial... JOE: Yes. GEORGE: The defense tried to make an issue of this? Yes. - But you say you weren't doing this for the money. I was not. At one point, I actually told the FBI, "Don't pay me anything. Just cover expenses." - The concept that Joe Moore would not have been paid or his payments were contingent on positive reporting or results is just a fallacy. If his payments were dependent on arrests or successful operations, then we wouldn't have been paying him up to that point. - Defense also tried to argue that your mental-health issues made you an unreliable witness. That's fine. Prove it. - Not one element of his mental-health struggles dealt with truthfulness, and they can say his truthfulness was suspect all they want. Tapes don't lie. JASON: Joe weathered the cross-examination well, and the jury found him credible enough to find these men guilty. Moran and Newcomb were sentenced to 12 years each. LATONYA: And I thank God for it, and I thank God for the informant that told his story, that put his life on the line for us, because this could have been so wrong. It could have been so wrong. [instrumental hip-hop beat] JASON: For Warren, even though that plot was foiled and these men were put in prison, he lives with a constant fear that someone's gonna come and finish what their Klan brothers couldn't. LATONYA: People know who we are, but we don't know who all they are. TERRILL: And so he found himself just stuck in the house and looking out the window and making sure no strange cars were around. And that's a very difficult place to be for years, for a lifetime. WARREN: I kind of like being alone more, but I try not to have too many friends because... I really can't trust everybody in the world. LATONYA: He will sit in the house and make beats, He write poems. He's more into poetry and music. I don't really think he even talk to people. You know, it was hard for him to come out the house. Warren hasn't been fishing. - That serenity has totally been shattered because that thing that he loves to do was part of the plan of the Klan to kill him. [soft dramatic music] ♪♪ ♪♪ I had one very simple question after reporting this story for Florida's corrections officials. If you know that there were Klansmen working in one of your prisons, what have you done to investigate whether or not this is a wider problem? And I was told by them that there was no indication or evidence that would lead to a wider investigation. I know that's not true in a couple of ways. One, Joe Moore told me that he had evidence that other members of the Klan had also worked at that same prison. JOE: As Grand Nighthawk, I had access to membership lists, and that information was vetted. This list has not only Thomas Driver, David Moran, and Charles Newcomb on the list, it has other law enforcement officers on the list as well. JASON: Beyond Joe's list, my investigation found numerous more recent cases of Florida prison guards who are suspected members of white supremacist groups at prisons throughout the state of Florida, not just the Florida Reception and Medical Center. This is QAnon symbolism here. It's like a "Punisher." If you drive to the parking lot of the prison where these Klansmen work, you will see symbols that are used by white supremacist groups slapped on as stickers on the cars in the employee parking lot, and you would think that as somebody who works for a state institution, those types of symbols, while covered by the First Amendment, would still be frowned upon. There's an institutional indifference by the Department of Corrections to my questions and to this problem as a whole. And we know this is just not a Florida problem. It's just not a correctional problem. - White nationalists are seeing it as their time. [people chanting] [impacts, people screaming, tires screeching] MERRICK: The top domestic violent extremist threat we face comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race. JASON: Louisiana... - Tonight a Lake Arthur police officer is out of a job over a controversial picture... REPORTER: Taken at a Ku Klux Klan meeting. Michigan... - Muskegon police officer is now on leave after KKK memorabilia was discovered in his home. Ohio... - The Sheffield Lake police chief has resigned after video emerged of him placing KKK imagery on a raincoat belonging to a Black officer. JASON: So the Klan is also evolving and morphing, often joining up with other more modern groups. all: [shouting indistinctly] Stop the steal! GREG: From the Proud Boys to the Oath Keepers to the Klan, that ribbon of racial identity or white supremacy runs through all of them. PERSON: You fucking traitors! GREG: These groups are trying to recruit law enforcement, and they're using and twisting these symbols. CHRIS: They're armed. They've had training. They have access to confidential information. GREG: When we talk about extremism within law enforcement, I've heard 1%. I've heard 2%. Nobody wants to hear, "It's OK. I have 2% cancer." It's going to spread. JASON: The states that have tried to implement screening have come against the correctional guards unions, and they're powerful. You see in the federal level, hearings and discussions, at least, of these types of problems, but at the state level, they're not seemed to be taken very seriously. [indistinct shouting] TERRILL: And it's something that has to stop. Until America decides to live its creed... and face up to its flaws, there will continue to be stories that shock the conscience. JASON: After the trial, Joe's identity is now discoverable because he testified in open court. - It's the last goal of the Bureau, or any law enforcement, is to expose your informants. Is it the case in some states and jurisdictions? Sometimes you're required to. - He is responsible for putting away members of the Ku Klux Klan. It's a betrayal, not only of his Klan oath from the Klan point of view, but also these men who he'd befriended. The FBI gave him and his family a new identity, new names and put him into Witness Protection. But at some point, someone who is affiliated with the Klan contacted Joe and said, "We know where you are." JOE: We have had representatives from the KKK come to our house, let us know they know where we live. We've had supporters of KKK contact us on our phones. I have no choice but to come out and speak to the general public in an effort to try to bring light to the issues that I uncovered when I was undercover. If something were to happen to me because of the threats, I needed the world to know the truth. ZOE: So the youngest doesn't grasp what Daddy has really done, but as far as my two older children, they look at my husband as a hero. - You recently met Warren Williams. JOE: Yes, I did. [soft dramatic music] How you doing, Warren? Nice to finally meet you. Nice to meet you, too. - Thank you so much for coming over. - I'd like to say thank you for what you did for me. - You got it, man. You got it. Thank you. JOE: When I met Warren Williams... I... I was fighting back the tears. You just want to open that gate right there for me? Warren and I, we both like to fish. I could see that when he's fishing, he's just-- it's just him and nature. ♪♪ ♪♪ And it's just mind-blowing how people can have so much disdain for a fellow human being, certainly one as such as Warren is. - Can I ask a personal question? - Sure. - It's not towards you. - Oh, you can ask me anything. - It has to do with me. OK. - No matter who you are, no matter how old you are, you don't always make good decisions. - Uh-huh. - Someone has to be there to protect you. Through thick and thin, somebody should be there... right? Like... having somebody you can go to for advice... or... The kind of person you are. - Oh. [chuckles] So, in your situation, you were not treated fairly. There were so many things wrong with that. And... I sympathize with things that you might have gone through, and... it's not any more complicated than that. [tender music] LATONYA: Warren have a beautiful soul. He do. He's a great person. I raised Warren to be the man that I would want to marry one day. [laughs] And he is. He is. JOE: All right. There you go, buddy-- a little one-pounder. LATONYA: I want him to at least try to move on with his life... but I don't know if that will ever happen. ♪♪ ♪♪ TERRILL: But I think he's found a way to continue on.
