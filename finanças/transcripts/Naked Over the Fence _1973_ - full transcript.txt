NAKED OVER THE FENCE Did you finally arrive? I thought they hijacked you along the way. I should send you to bed without dinner. Rick? - I'm waiting for one more from France. Rick. I'm still waiting for Scared. I'll go alone. - Ok. When he comes, tell him to put his ring in the clock himself. You can all be such a pain. Rick, someone's causing trouble. He already put 75 bucks in. Can you fix it? That machine must have been rigged. Guilder. Don't lean on it so much, loudmouth. Anything else? Yes, a few slot machines don't make any profit. Which one? This one? You'd think there's a hole in it. You've been telling me Ed's your best friend for weeks. And now that he makes his comeback, you hang around here. Ok, what are we waiting for? I'll be back before 12. If Scared comes in. - Yes, yes. 35,000 points. First ball. Tenner. Quickly. Bye. KARATE CHAMPIONSHIPS all categories Osu. - Osu. Chicken with apple juice. How do you feel? - Not bad. Does your back still hurt? - Only when I laugh. You won't feel like laughing at the moment. It's a full house. They're all here. There are also some TV guys. It's now or never. My last chance at a comeback. Be prepared for his seiken. - I know. Let's go. - Yes. Osu. - Osu. Good luck, buddy. Hey, that's Lilly. - Lilly who? Lilly Marischka, that singer from TV. You know. How do you like her? - Not exactly my type. I don't like those guys either. They seem to belong somewhere else. Ladies and gentlemen. The final of All categories. Ed Swaan, first dan. Loek Hollander, second dan. Why don't they really hit each other? Because they'd be dead. I thought that's what they were here for. That was a seiken chudan tsuki. He's half a point behind. Is that all? - You only need one point. Equal. With a mae geri. He wins. - How do you know? That was a mawashi geri. A mawashi what? - A mawashi geri. Signature. My treat. Champagne or a beer at home? I have a date. Hello, darling. Congratulations. This is Lilly Marischka. But you already knew that. Floor van de Terpe, my TV director. Haaks and Lode Zaayer, the well- known journalist. Ah, you write in... - Indeed, I do. Rick Lemming and Penny van der Laan. Shall we? - Shall we go home too then? Ed, have fun. I'll see you. Take care, Rick. Pen, see you tomorrow. Osu. - Osu. She's got him wrapped around her finger. Better him than me. With her southern accent. Did Scared come in? - No, not yet. The French must have made pâté of him. Did Ed win? - Yes, with a nasi goreng. One of the best mawashi geri's I've ever seen. Isn't that what I said? Hold this. Look. But aimed at his head. How did it go tonight? Pretty slow. - Yes, it's been better. About that slot machine again. - I'll go upstairs. Deal with it yourself. - Alright. It's not your woman. Take it easy. Besides, we're closing. He'd be humping that thing all night. - Healthy sport, pinball. I've thought about expanding. A nice gambling hall maybe. Pinball machines would be a good cover. I guess I'd lose my room. - Are you crazy? A school teacher is an even better cover. I'll follow you up. - To your pigeons, I bet. I'll check if Scared came in. Don't forget to tell him we had a good night. Can I point out that you owe me two months of rent? Guys, stay on the footpath. I'll be right back. How do you like her? Isn't she beautiful? And very sweet. Are you talking about me? - Lilly. Lilly Marischka. - Oh, her. What's wrong with you? You'd think I was the teacher. Did you have a rough night? - You bet. Lilly's pretty up herself. - Not at all. Where did you get that idea? - You're in love, aren't you? How did you meet her? Can you keep a secret? Don't tell anyone. Not Rick either. Lilly's making a movie. With the people she was with. I met her when they asked me for the movie. Great, a karate film? No, a sort of art film. You don't have to be nude, do you? Are you crazy? I just have to show my muscles. They're TV people. Floor van de Terpe directs it. And Lode Zaayer, from the newspaper, wrote it. They're shooting it in the studio behind here. He's been my back neighbour for three years. I'll have my first shoot tonight. Don't tell anyone. They don't want any publicity yet. Maybe you'll go to Hollywood. That would be something. Osu. Osu. - Osu. Ed. Do you know what Ed's doing? Get off my roof. Peace and quiet. - Yes, but... See Golden Oldie? He has to come in. A pigeon only comes in when the atmosphere's relaxed. So go away. - Yes, but... If you insist on saying something, say it cheerfully. As if you're chatting. In a relaxed way. I think you need to help Ed. Screw him. He owes me 200 bucks. He has to play in a movie. Maybe nude. That movie will be a failure then. It's in the studio behind him. When I looked in there just now... - Relax. He's shaking already. Somebody pulled a woman's clothes off her. And it was being filmed. If you keep this up, that pigeon will still be there tomorrow. I'll see what I'll do. Not so shy, Lilly. Ed Swaan. Ed. Put this on. We'll try it on. I'm not wearing that. I won't make a fool of myself. Wait, it's only about the atmosphere. Can't I just lay on the bed? This isn't some vulgar porn flick. - Anyway, I'm quitting. What? We worked on this De Sade for half a year. Can't you see we don't want it anymore? - Guys, relax. We can always talk about it. Lilly, you can't go back on your word. Besides, this is the last scene. Let's finish it. We'll talk later. - What will happen with this movie? You know. Only very select showings. And it's not a porn flick. I don't believe you anymore. Give me all the scenes with me in it. Lilly, that's not the deal. Give me that film. We're going home. - No one touches my film Ed! Lilly, come here. Come. They had a good go at you. Maybe it can become a good martial arts movie. Those punks. The cowards got me from behind. Did you know those two? - Yes. Little pimps. I kicked them out of my sports school once. What was the disagreement about? - They fooled me. Sadistic nonsense. That leather thing with nails. Weirdos. - Does it hurt badly? Come on. My clothes are still there. I can hardly go and ask for them. No, let's get out. Don't ask. Can Lilly spend the night here? Osu. - Osu. Can't I just go home? Don't be stupid. Penny? Yes, sir. How can you be so stupid? I don't know. These days, they're all naked in movies. Meathead. Lilly said it was a nice movie. And that Lode and Floor were serious artists. Karate Champ And Famous Singer Naked Over The Fence I owe everything to Lode. He discovered me. He paid for my singing lessons. He got me publicity in the papers. And then he asked me for the movie. You didn't know what kind of movie. - Yes, I did. I liked the nudity, but then I realised it could be used against me. Especially now that my records are so successful. What are you on about? They didn't really film me. What do you think Haaks was doing? They've got you in every position. Really? What do we do now? You have something to think about while I go check on my pigeon. John Wayne. - Give me a break. I know where you're going. To Haaks' studio. Bloody hell. - It's Haaks. Now your movie's a real problem. What do we do now? - Get to the studio before the police. Someone has gone crazy last night. Hurry. Soon the whole neighbourhood will be out on their balconies. You don't have to look for the film anymore. Here are Lilly's clothes. And here are mine. Damn, they're covered in blood. That tells us he was killed here. And they try to frame it on you. But why did they put him on the tram wires? Maybe they thought he'd burn. Amateurs. No grounding. They're both gone. - We have to find her. Maybe Penny knows where she is. Where's Lilly? - She had to see Lode Zaayer. With the charming singer... who will receive a gold record tomorrow. She smiles at me and places her well proportioned body on the sofa. Lilly looks at me and says... Goddamn! What are you doing here? Get out, get out. I'll call you back. Where's Lilly? - I don't know. You had her on your sofa just now. I won't do that interview until tonight. Where's your film that also features Ed? Do you care? - He does and he gets angry quickly. Look angry, Ed. Who finances the movie? Nobody. We're paying for it ourselves. Floor van de Terpe and I. Floor wanted something else on TV. Something nice. But who paid Haaks? I told you. We paid for it ourselves. With money you got from the actors by threatening to show the movie. He means blackmail. Look at Ed. He's a karate champion. Imagine you're a brick. I don't have time, darling. And the film? - Nothing. Lilly, TV show, 4 o'clock. - Where do you get the nerve? Thanks for the hospitality. We'll see ourselves out, darling. Do you ever take the tram? - No, never, why? I thought as much. Ok, go behind the letters. She looks scared. - Not surprising. She's scared to death of that mob. But she needs them badly. Someone's looking at us. Lode must have told them everything. Thanks, Lilly. Can we do the interview now? Who's the hot bitch? How should I know? I think she likes you. But she's been sent by Lode. Find out where Lilly's dressing room is. Silence on the set, please. Lilly Marischka, it's great to have you here in the studio. She's been number one in the Dutch charts for seven weeks now. Tomorrow she'll receive... - a gold record. Pop- minded people, what is so great about Lilly. That she still sings in the church of her home town during Christmas. Why are you looking like that? - It's part of my job. Tell us more about your tour abroad? - No. Is that a compliment? Occupational disability. When will your next record be released? - I don't know yet. And what do you do? Nothing. - You're just beautiful, rich and smart. Why are you here then? I'm engaged to the director, for the time being. I'll never understand beautiful women. Do you owe your entire success to your vocal capabilities? Yes. - Yes, I don't think so either. Can I offer you something? What did you have in mind? A piece of cake. Alright. I know where the canteen is. Maybe I'm a Sunday's child. Lilly's going to sing her big hit 'A Letter Came Today'. I see you have beautiful eyes. So you're engaged to this Floor. I think you have trouble getting out of bed. But I have no trouble getting in. Can I ask your name? Celia Strumpf. Strumpf? - Strumpf. I can't help it. - It's the name of my last husband. My name's Rick Lemming. Are you here just for me? No, for a signature of Lilly. So you're a fan. - No, a producer. I'm offering her a contract for a second movie. Mr Duys, I have a special act. Please listen. Come, that's not Duys. - It's not Duys? Can I laugh too? - Darling, this is Rick. He couldn't find the canteen. I showed him the way. I've met this gentleman. At a karate match? That's true. Excuse me for a moment. What does he want? He has a gaming hall. If I want to find out more, I'll need all night. I bet. Lode says he's looking for the film. Then he's looking for you. You still don't trust me. - You might have it. A fantastic woman. No chance to get to her. Lode beat me to it. But I've got something else for you. I bet the film's in that briefcase. How do you know? He brought it to Lilly's dressing room and he wasn't happy to see me. We'll find out soon enough. Excuse me, your briefcase. Can I talk to you, Lilly? - We're busy. Another time. - Ok, but be careful. You can't trust anyone these days. I have to go urgently. - What a shame. I'll see you again. As long as you don't get in my way. - That depends on you. And on me. You were right. Did you see Lode's face when I bumped into his briefcase? But why was Lilly talking to Lode? I think she's trying to get that movie from him. In her own way. Just let her be. I'm going home. See you later. We might have Lilly and the film tonight. There's our pinball king. Very funny. Can I get through? This is our last friendly warning. Mind your own business or you won't play any pinball machines anymore. Tilt. CORPSE ON TRAM WIRES Rick, there's someone to see you. I'm coming. Van Halsden, publisher of novels, comic strips, office supplies. Do you make good money with your pinball hall? I could imagine you might want to modernise. I could help you with that. I work alone. - We all do. I publish porn magazines, among other things. It's profitable, so I want to keep my market share. One of my employees, Floor van de Terpe, is in a bit of trouble. He's making a movie for a small audience. I finance this movie. I can only make a profit if I sell the movie to France and Belgium. So what? If you don't interfere with my movie project, I'd like to repay the favour. I call that bribery. - It's modern trading. I can't live off Tintin. I'm nauseous... very nauseous. Not because of your face or your proposition. But yesterday your guys beat me up. Either you have me beaten up or you offer me money. Not both. I don't know anything about it. Then I'd rather talk to someone who does. Good afternoon. - If you change your mind... I said good afternoon. Did you bring me flowers? - Sure. Bitch. Look who's talking. Your own pigeons don't even come back. I'd buy a bigger wallet if I were you. Ladies and gentlemen, a moment of silence please. Quiet! Friend. - Thank you. Time for a word of welcome. Especially to our friends from the media. The media are the backbone of our society. Especially the entertainment and television media. Without them, this big success wouldn't have been possible. That's why we offer free records to members of the press. That's quite enough! In that case I'd say have a drink and wait for Lilly Marischka. Dick. Come, let's have a drink. - Again? This is my little brother. That's the second time today. That's alright. I saw through you the first time. Dick. Will this be in your paper tomorrow? Charming Celia Strumpf entertained us with a dance of her own design. Celia has spent six happy months with Lilly Marischka's... director, Floor van de Terpe. Husband number how many will he be? She's had one from every television station. And that brother of hers? - What about him? I hear he specialises in arty porn movies. What do you mean? You could have told me yesterday that he finances your movie. Dick. - Slut. She has more class in her pink than you in your entire body. Leave me alone. Stop bothering me. Are you also trying to buy this theatre? I'd like to talk to you. Not now. If what I think is true, it's looking bad... I have to go on stage. - Ok, afterwards then. Get someone. Get a doctor. Let go of me. Who's that? - I'll tell you later. The police have started an investigation. The singer was badly injured and has been taken to hospital. Her condition is stable. What's your first comment? It's tragic. Really tragic. I still can't understand it. Lilly was at the beginning of a great career. I don't know if she can overcome this. Have you got any idea who did this? No, I don't think she has any enemies. But it's a world where jealousy plays a big role. It looks like the entertainment industry has just witnessed a new scandal. Can you finally tell me what's going on? You were right when you said Ed was in trouble. He got involved with people who are making a movie with lots of nudity. Lilly didn't want it anymore, but when Ed joined she had the guts... to ask for the film back. They got upset and Ed and Lilly climb naked over the fence. And then camera man Haaks got killed. And the film has disappeared. And now this attack on Lilly. Someone in that group kills everyone who's causing a problem. But who? - Could be anyone. Lode Zaayer, Floor, the sponsor. Or the guys who dumped me in the canal. Why don't you go to the police? - Me? What will you do then? Find that film. Problem solved. And I can get my lazy ass back on the roof with my pigeons. Oh, your pigeon from Rouen returned. Did Scared come back? I'll be damned. Lemming speaking. - Do you know who this is? Yes. - Come or I'll be late. It's Celia. What do you want? - To see you from up close. I could also tell you something very interesting. About a film, for instance. But you have to be here within the hour. - Where? Wait. Can't you wait a moment? This is two months of rent. Could be the last. Give me the address. - 26 Zuwe, Vinkeveen. Are you Mr Lemming? - Yes. I'm from the work agency. - Talk to him. Who's that girl? - From the work agency. I'm going on a holiday next week. You know. Where's Penny? - At her school, by now. Bloody hell, couldn't she have waited? She said you could drop dead. - The little bitch. You're here quicker than I thought. Are the doors always open here? - No. Only when you're coming. Where's your fiancé? - Fiancé? Floor. He's almost never here. Don't you believe me? He hasn't been here for days. He's preparing some TV program. We live our own lives. And you like that. - Yes. Is that an invitation or a warning? Both. So we don't have to count on Floor. That's a pity. What was it you had to tell me? Hello, teacher. We've come to get you. Miss? That's Max and I'm Cas. People sometimes confuse us. Can we come too, Miss? One wrong word and they have to come. My cousins are taking me for a ride in their new car. My father has a much better car. - But we have the teacher. I don't understand that Floor of yours. What do you want to understand? Why someone who's engaged to you, has to make such a smutty movie. Have you seen the movie? - No, but I witnessed the last shoot. Whose crazy idea was it? Floor's and Lode's. I only got them the money, via my brother. He invested quite a bit of money in it. Making movies is expensive. Haaks asked a lot of money. - The late Haaks. That's one of the reasons I asked you to come here. And the other reason is? The other reason was. Poor Haaks. That murder scared me. And then that attack on Lilly. Jesus. I've always lived with people who took shortcuts, but now... I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. Is that why you'll tell me who did it? Yes, there's only one person who could do something like... Rick, it's me. They've... Penny, where... Penny? You've recognised her voice. She's standing next to me. Nothing has happened to her yet. - You, filthy... You won't get her back with name calling. If I'm correct, you have the film at the moment. I have an interesting proposition. Stop it. Where and when? You'll find out tomorrow morning. I'm sure you're smart enough not to go to the police. You look pretty bad. - They killed Celia and got Penny. I'll explain later. They want the film. Do you still have it? - I'll bring it tonight. I'll beat them... - Impossible, How's Lilly? - They say she'll be alright. Is she there? I'll see you tonight. Ok. - Good luck. Can you hear me? I want to ask you something. Before the accident, there was someone in your dressing room. Stop it. I'm De Heer. - I thought he'd look much different. Police Inspector. You're becoming more and more interesting to us. Your traces have been found in Haaks' studio. You were at Lilly's reception. Ed Swaan's a friend of yours. You were in the dressing room, just before the attack. And now you're interrogating the victim. Maybe you want to take over my investigation. Talk this way, young lady. It was Lode. In the dressing room. Lode Zaayer, the journalist. - Yes, I know. What else? Lode... Beemster... mill... the singing Vink sisters. A mill in the Beemster? - A second house. Lucky man. Bye, nurse. I'm expecting you at the station tomorrow morning. We'll have a good talk. And you can meet your friend Zaayer as well. Thank God there's the police. Everything alright? There's the pinball king. Yes? Molly or Dolly? - Molly. Why are you here? I believe Lode Zaayer's here. No, you're wrong. - Anybody there? Where are you going? - Can't you see? Look at that. That looks nice. Tarzan. Go away! I'm De Heer. Criminal Investigation. Mr Zaayer, what are you doing here? I'm trying to get some peace and quiet here. Nice and cosy, the three of you. Lode always comes here after an important interview. We help him relax. Also after the attempted murder of Lilly Marischka? I have nothing to do with that. You were seen backstage, just before the attempt. What's wrong with that? I'm her manager. It was purely a business discussion. Purely business? - Yes, of course. You didn't discuss the movie you made with Van de Terpe? What are you on about? - You know very well. Who gave you the order? Why would I tell you? No! Quickly or I'll arrest you as you are. Ok, I'll tell you. It was all Van Halsden's idea. If my old mother saw this, she'd faint. It's the worst for my pigeons. They don't know where I am. Where are we anyway. - Can't you smell? This is an old bakery, where they're hiding. Where they store their porn articles. They locked me up all night here. At least you didn't get bored. Celia has been killed. What? That's not possible. Not possible? It's true. They just found out. The house has been sealed off. I came here straight away. I can't... - You weren't that close to her. Bastard, are you saying... - Who else? Lode? Or those two? Did you hear that? My sister got killed. And this bastard tries... Sit down. Who's the boss here? I am. - I am. Wrong. We are. Bloody... You were making a movie to sell... and he made it to blackmail people. And you weren't allowed to know that. But you both forgot to combine the two. And that's what we're going to do. Without any killing. The way it should be done. Have you forgotten who's paying you? No, you are. - But so is he. We'll be right back. Osu. - Now what do we do? Do as I do. And what do I yell? - Anything. Ichi, ni, san. Osu? - Osu. And now what? Osu. Have you got the film? Osu. - Osu. Bloody hell, now what? Van Halsden fled and we're chasing the twins. How did you find us? - Am I your mate or not? Well then. - Osu. Osu. - Your sister's puss. They found out after all. What? - I put a Disney movie in the canister. Their movie is at the bottom of the canal. Look, their car. There. You stay here. Rick, look! Now what do we do? Come on. What are you doing? Wait. Yes, it's working. - Well I'll be. How do you close the door? - I don't know. There. - There they are. Look in front of you and go faster. There they are. Max, faster. Faster, Max. FULL There are people on the rails. - Shut up. But look. - Shut up, asshole. Are you out of your mind? Careful! That was my mother. That was my mother. To the back, old tram fart. Go back with that thing. To the front. Go! And backwards. Hold on. There we go. Get out. Stay here. Where are you going? I guess that's how you looked when you killed Haaks. And him. And Celia. Van de Terpe. In your own interest... Come down. The studio has been surrounded. Osu. - Osu. Now we quickly go home, before those tramps beat us to it. Hello Scared, too afraid again? I'll give you a ride home.
