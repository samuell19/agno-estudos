- Guess what, I got a new job. Doing what you might ask. I now work for the ridesharing service DropUOff. Now you may be saying to yourself, "Tom, don't you need a car to give people rides?" Guess what, Tom Riley's got a car, baby. I went to auction today, and I had the winning bid on this. And if you don't recognize it, that's my old van. I won it back for less than I owed on it when it was repossessed. So I gotta do a little work, get a couple things installed, but by tonight, you'll be able to call Tom Riley when you need a ride. I'm back baby. Hey, Jose, can I take this now? Front dash cam connected. Rear dash cam connected. Interior dash cam connected. - Now according this, I have to pick a voice. Number one, Kevin Spacey. Hi, this is Kevin Spacey-- - No that's creepy. - Oh, I'm sorry, you don't like this voice? - Number two, Jeff Goldblum. This is Jeff Goldblum, this is the DropUOff dash cam. - Number three, this one is perfect. This is the DropUOff dash cam. - Morgan Freeman, yeah. Feels good, doesn't it? - All right. - Door ajar. Door ajar. - All right, ready for work. Door ajar. What the fuck is this? No return address and no post mark, so this was obviously hand delivered. What the fuck is this? It's an amulet of some sort. What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Well, nothing in the envelope. Is that glowing? Well, for right now, it's going in there. Who sends me this shit? The fuck is that? Oh, I don't know what the fuck that was, but I got my first customer. All right, let's see. I should be coming up on it here soon. There it is, 26 Silver Lake Drive. Gary? - Yeah. - Hi, I'm Tom, I'm your DropUOff driver. - All right. Door ajar. - How you doing tonight? - Ah, not too bad. - So where am I takin' ya? - 352 Steelmanville Road. - Say that again. - 352 Steelmanville Road in the township. You have a GPS, right? - Don't worry, I'm very familiar with the location. What's going on there? - Why? - I'm just curious. - Just drive. - So ya lived around here long? - No, not really, it's kinda new. - Sorry, am I talking too much? - A little bit. All right. So have you ever been to this house before? - Nope, first time for everything though, right? - No, I'll just keep my mouth shut. The house got a little bit of a history. That's why I asked why you were going there. - Is it really old or something? - No, it's not that. It's like 20 years old. - How's it have history then? - Well, I actually owned this house for a little while. - Really? - Do you believe in ghosts? - No, it's garbage. - All right, forget I said anything. - So, what's this here? - That is a rideshare driver's dash cam. There's one in the back that sees the road behind me, in in case I get rear-ended. There's one out front in case I have an accident. And then there's this one inside that keeps an eye on me and the passengers in case there's any problem. - Like what kinda problems? - Well, like in case ya hit me or something. - Do you get hit a lot? - No, actually, to be honest with you, tonight's my first night driving for DropUOff, and you're my first passenger. - Well, look at that, lucky me. - And this camera here is my body cam, so anything none of the, if I have to get out for any reason like to help somebody up to their house with groceries or something, this covers that. So all my bases are covered. - I can see that. Got a camera on every angle, huh? - Just about. The fuck are all these people doing out here? Okay, here we are. Now, hold on, hold on now. - Okay, good night, have a good time. Door ajar. - I can't believe he's going in that house. Let's see. All right, here we are. That's gotta be him. David? - Yeah. - Hi, I'm Tom, I'm your DropUOff driver. Door ajar. - How you doing tonight? - Pretty good, you? - Good. Let me try and catch this light. I'll never catch that light. Maybe I will, son of a bitch. So where am I taking you? - 352 Steelmanville Road in EHT. - Really? - Yeah. Why? - Oh, it's just I just took somebody there earlier. What's the guy doing, you going to a party or something? - Nah, I have a job interview there. - A job interview at this time of night, on Halloween? - Just, just drive. - Sorry. - Who was the other guy you dropped off there? Does it look like I have some competition or? - He didn't say he was going for a job interview. I don't know, I mean, assuming he is, I don't know. He's kind of a dummy. I shouldn't say that. You're about to meet him. You're gonna tell him, then he's gonna rate me on the DropUOff app. I'll get a one star my first night of driving. - If he's a dummy and I get the job, I'll rate you five stars to counteract his one star. - So I'll have two and a half. So what kinda job are you applying for? - I'm, honestly I'm not sure. They called me and like, "We have a job for you." They were kinda vague about it, and I asked them if I had some time to get ready, and they said just come as you are. - Well, just judging by the fact you're wearing shorts, I guess you're doing that. Not that I'm being critical or anything. So you don't know what the job is you're going to an interview for? Late on Halloween? - I figure if they singled me out and happened to call me, it must be some good opportunity. - Well, did they tell you they train you? - Yeah, they said they will do onsite training, so no experience necessary. - Mmh, well find out if they have two positions open, because I qualify for no experience necessary. But I won't go in and be your competition. So you lived here in this area long? - Couple months, kinda been hard to find work out here, so I was hooked with the jump on this job. At this point, I kinda just need money, regardless what the job is. - Well, it's coming up here on the left. Here we are. - All right. Looks, fuck. - Good night. Door ajar. - I think you wanna go up the front. I think you wanna go up to the front. I think you wanna go up to the front. Oh yeah. - Yeah, he's a real fucking Einstein there.

So where am I taking you tonight? - 352 Steelmanville Road, Egg Harbor Township. - Wow, popular place. - What? - Well, you're the third person I'm driving there tonight. Are you going for a job interview too? - Just drive. - In case you're hungry, there's some chips in there. - I'm on a special diet. - Vegan? - No. - Actually, the shape you're in, you look like a guy that likes a good steak. How do ya like it cooked? - Very rare. - Well, we're coming up on 352 Steelmanville Road. - Wait here, I'll be a little while. - All right if I wait though, there's an extra charge. - Will that cover it? - Yeah, that'll do. - Good. Door ajar. - But wait here, you understand? - All right, can you give me an idea how long? Okay. - Can't have that now can we? ♪ Far away, you might hear ♪ ♪ All of your ignorance that just ♪ ♪ Won't endear ♪ All right, and you've been listening to "Won't Endear," the new release from David B.

I don't wanna ask you why you're being such a dick to me. - If you wanna make it a little more pleasant, maybe a little less of this maybe. - Okay, you just tell me where to turn.

Is something moving in that bag? - No, it's just, it's nothing, it's just me. You can turn left here. - Here or there? - Up there. - So I would ask that when you rate your ride, you give me five stars because I'm just such an excellent driver and conversationalist.

He keeps rejecting all of my calls. - Dammit, you have no further use to me then. - Wait, wait, wait, I have an idea. - What? - The DropUOff app, it shows you the location. - Where is he? - The PatCon campground. - I can't go there, too many people. - I have an idea. - Seriously? - It's a lot faster than walking. - You know that I've tasted your blood.

You want some of this? - No, no, relax, it's just me. - Is that a fucking bite on your neck? - Just, just one bite mark, couldn't be bit three times. Should I check his pulse? He's a vampire, motherfucker. He didn't have a pulse to begin with. Find my fucking keys. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get in the fucking car. Door ajar. - Come on, let's get the fuck outta here before something else show up. - Oh, my god what is that? I don't fucking know, and I don't fucking care. Let's just get the fuck outta here. I fuckin' told you, I fuckin' told you you should know where you're going. Job interview, I'm going to a job interview. At fucking that night time of night, on Halloween? You shoulda known it was some sorta bullshit. I mean, I wouldn't have guessed it was you were going to Dracula's house, but still you had to know something was wrong, that it just wasn't right. I mean, come on. - It's tough times. Sometimes we need money. You gotta take every opportunity that comes to you. - Well, money's not gonna do you any good if you're fucking dead now, is it? - I guess. - You guess. If you, you know what? That's why I don't have fucking kids. You're why I don't have fucking kids. So was Gary in that house when you went in there? - I heard some noise rustling around upstairs, and I just, I didn't know what was going on. Next thing you know out of nowhere, get bit from behind. I'm thinking it was a dog or-- - Am I clear that way? - Yeah. - I'm fucking looking. Jerkoff, flashing your fucking lights. Here's my suggestion for you. It's coming up on the holidays. Wal-Mart's hiring. I even saw a help wanted sign at the Kmart that's closing, okay, so that's at least now 'til Christmas, and guess what? I seriously doubt you're gonna have to go there late at night for an interview. It'll probably be during the day. So try get, why don't you get a little fucking closer on my tail, you motherfucker? Goddammit, I hate drivers around here. So what happened? You got bit from behind. So you just walked in there, there's nobody in this fucking house, and you're just hanging out there, and then something bites you from behind. When you walked in an empty house, you didn't think that was strange? - I've been in worse situations so I didn't think-- - You've been in worse situation, what kinda fucking situations do you get into? I've been in worse situations. I need to meet your fucking parents. No I don't. After I drop you the fuck off, I don't need to see you again. - Probably a good idea. - Probably a good idea. Yeah, it's gonna break my fucking heart, and let me tell you something, motherfucker. I got your address. If you fucking rate me below, I fucking took you away from your death. I gave you an escape from your fucking death. You better rate me five stars. - After you left me there. - I left, what do you mean I left you there? I fucking dropped you off. Oh, that's right, I did throw you outta the fucking car, didn't I? - Yeah. - When we got back. Yeah, but you stole my van. - So I guess that makes us even. - Makes us even. Fucking, do you know how lucky you are to have me as a driver? Because I'm Tom Riley, all right? No ghost, no fucking vampire, no anything, what the fuck is that? Anyway, nothing can fucking, I just seem to outwit 'em all somehow. You're lucky I was your driver tonight. If you were that fat fucking prick Mike, who drives around this area, and he picked you the fuck up, you'd be dead. Or he might be dead 'cause he'd make quite a meal. Bet ya that fucker, what do we have nine pints of blood in us? I bet ya that fucker's got 10. Do you think I should see a doctor about this? - I don't know fucking know. See a veterinarian. - What? - I don't know. I don't know what the fucking treatment is for a vampire. Is this your fucking house? - Yeah. - All right, get the fuck out. Get out. Door ajar. - Bye. What a fucking night. I wish I knew why all these weird things happen to me. Why tonight all these strange people and paranormal things have been drawn to me. They are attracted to the amulet. - What? Are you telling me that because of this amulet, all these things have been coming to me, drawn to me, following me? So if I get rid of this it stops, right? Get rid of it and see. - All right. It's gone. Weird stuff over, back to normal. Feels good, doesn't it? - What? Well, she is on my way. All right, I'll pick you up. Where the hell is this chick? It's like the middle of nowhere. Is that someone standing there? Holy shit. Hi, I'm Tom Riley, I'm your DropUOff driver. I'm sorry, I don't know how to pronounce your name. Door ajar. - Lucinda. - Lucinda, that's a pretty name. So where am I taking you? - I live on the outskirts of town. Just drive. - Okay. Now, hold on, hold on now. - Put your seatbelt on. Whoa, that's right. So I don't mean to cross any lines here, but I got this friend. He's a big guy, his name's Ben. He's kinda would dig a chick like you if you'd like to meet him. How big? - Hey, fuckface, you know why I gave you zero stars in the DropUOff app? It's 'cause you fucking left me there, and I wasn't fucking dead yet, so fuck you.
