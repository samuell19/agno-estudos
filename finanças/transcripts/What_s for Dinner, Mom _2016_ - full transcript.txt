I found a box A Japanese style box But no ordinary box It holds my memories Aren't you going inside? I was waiting for you. You grew up here. You should have. No, I'm happy just looking. You don't want to rebuild here? No, of course I will. There's dust everywhere. Hey, Yo. Do you remember the safe combination? No, I don't. You used to open it all the time. What was it? How much is in there? A hundred million yen? Or a parcel of shares. Whatever, we split it down the middle. If the will says so. Maybe the will's inside? That's why we haven't found it. Mom would've left us the combination. You got it open. It's empty. I feel like a disappointed safecracker. Is that me? Must be. Everything in boxes? Yes. Please. November 1 8, 1 972.

Taiwanese tempura. Spring rolls. Turnip cake. WHAT'S FOR DINNER, MOM? It sure does. Looks delicious. I saw your sister on TV. Really? I also read it Remember how she used to tag along behind you? Now she's a major star. Her songs are so mature, so moving. This is one of hers. This reminds me of your school lunches. Pickled eggs with heaps of rice. We'd never seen anything like it. Taiwanese food. Check out Hitoto's lunch! Correct Sandwich A young student's lunch is good special Really Take a look. Really what is that? Have not seen What is that brown? Is that pork? This is it Pigs trotters. Just like your mother made. First time I ever saw trotters was at your place. Thank you Halt is so good Are you okay with that? It's falling off the bone. Great, thanks. Was invited to the first your family We went to that Taiwan-themed party at your place. Yo was devouring a big pig's trotter. It was twice as big as her hands. I'm scared Trotters were your family's biggest treat. It was all so "savage." Now, everyone eats them, for the collagen. Gnawing relish What's this one? Radish cake? Sticky turnip cake. Mom used to make it all the time. How long ago did she die? Twenty years, now. That long ago? In my mind's eye, she's always cooking. In that big kitchen, flames everywhere. We've decided to rebuild. The old place is empty, anyway. That's right. I've never found any quite as good as Mom's. Mom's turnip cake was the best in the world. "Tokyo, 1 968" Me and my sister Our father was Taiwanese, our mother, Japanese. Their initial meeting was quite dramatic. Welcome, sir. Good day. Good day, sir. May I borrow that ring you're wearing? Ah, I want to borrow your ring. I'm sorry, sir. But I can't do that. I shall return it next week. Yes, but I'm sorry, it's not possible. I shall surely return it. I'm sorry, I can't. A problem, Mr Yan? No, I was just trying to borrow Miss Issei's ring. Hand it over. Give him the ring. Yes Thank you, Miss Issei. Now, could you please check me in? Certainly, sir. But one thing, sir. My name is read as Hitoto, not Issei. Mr Yan Huimin is the CEO of Taiyo Industries, Taiwan. His late father was a regular guest here. Do not neglect Please make yourself at home, Mr Yan. Miss Hitoto. That's a name I shall never forget. And I will never forget you, Mr Yan Huimin. I bet you were shocked. Yes, I certainly was. It's an engagement ring, isn't it? That's why I had to get it off your finger. Because now, you're unattached. That's why I lied to you. I didn't want to see you engaged. That's why I took it off you. But it's not an engagement ring. It was my late brother's ring. Oh, no. What have I done? Now will you return it? Sorry, I've lost it. That's terrible! Look... In exchange... Please accept this in its place. No. I couldn't possibly take it. Yes This is good You see It's delicious Come on, you see this That's good Add soy sauce. A touch of sugar. That's right And oil. The secret is to char the mixture. Make sure it's well-done. A writer just back from America has gone missing. Another dissident? You should be careful, too. Don't say that. I hate the thought of it. I've done nothing wrong. We know that. Everyone does. But you know why they target us? If we can bribe our way out of trouble, let's do it. Like you bribed your way out of China? I'm not Chinese. I'm Japanese! I'm the same with you When I first arrived, I couldn't speak Chinese, either. I couldn't understand a word they said. They speak Chinese to block me out. Then you must soon learn the language. Why did I even come here? Hello, Mr Yan. Mrs. Lee Are you okay? Fine thanks That's good To take care Thank you Bye Marry a chicken with a chicken to marry a dog with a dog After a while, Taiwan grows on you. Que sera sera. "1 976" This only to me it is good Wait Thank you This one good morning I want to buy this Come on, thank you Thank you good morning, Boss good morning good morning You've turned into quite the Taiwanese mother. You won't believe this. His mother insisted I learn to cook Taiwanese food. I try to learn Taiwan dishes every day But all he ever wants is Japanese tofu. Yes, Japanese tofu. I haven't had it for ages. But none of the shops here stock it. Our tofu is different. That's right ls dinner ready? In a minute, dear. There, it's all done. It's delicious, Mom. I'm glad. Can you take dinner up to your dad? Daddy, your dinner. Several times a year... My father rejected the outside world and locked himself in his room. At such times, he wouldn't come out. I stood at the door and asked why, but he never answered me. "Clan Headquarters 1 977" (Whisper, whisper little stream Flowing so gently in the Spring) (Near the shore flowers bloom) (All the colors of the rainbow Such sweet fragrances) (Blooming, in the sunshine The voice of Spring, whispering) Look at me Look at the front, the grandmother looked over Mom look here Okay, look here To laugh come To shoot one two Three Alright, thanks Thank you I want the girls to be educated in Japan. I agree. Shall we go to Japan? I want to go! Going to Taiwan Returning to Japan To which do I belong? That's my decision to make To my beloved Kazue, Tae and Yo. Be good, my dear daughters. Grow up strong and healthy. Soon after returning to Japan, lung cancer took my father. To make life in Japan easier... We dropped father's Chinese name and assumed mother's, Hitoto. I'm home. Hello dear. I want a Japanese lunch. Japanese? You mean rice balls, maybe omelet? And cut up a sausage to look like an octopus. But no salty plums. I hate them. Put the fruit in a separate container. Cut the apple like rabbit ears. That's a lot of work. I'm home. Hello dear. Let's go back to Taiwanese lunches. Where's your manners? I'm still hungry after that Japanese lunch. Too easily-digestible, not enough oil. Japan has better TV, but Taiwan has better lunches. Can I have a trotter tomorrow? They don't sell trotters here. But maybe a whole pig? Where would we find that? Yes, right. My youth was like living in a kaleidoscope "National Railways Privatized" Always having to swap from one culture to the other "Tokyo Real Estate Goes Stratospheric" Looked at through one eye, I look strange "Los Angeles Olympics Begin" "Taiwan Enbds Martial Law After 38 years" Looked at with both eyes, that's the real me Looked at with both eyes, that's the real me Written well "Personal Resume" So you're a qualified bookkeeper? And you're from the Noto Peninsular? For a short time, as a child. I'm from Noto, too. From Anamizu. Sorry, I don't remember much. No problem. Can you start from tomorrow? Yes, I can. We Noto-ites must stick together. Yes, of course. Ah, yes. Sweet-bean rice cake! This was my granddad's favorite. Everyone from Ishikawa Pref. loves them. Take it for your kids. Really? I'm thrilled, thank you so much. May I have some now? Go ahead. Such memories. Delicious! It reminds me of Granddad. My recollection of Mom was always smiling, always optimistic. Very straightforward and a friend to all. Welcome. Do you sell pigs feet? Feet? You mean trotters? Yes, trotters. Uncooked. No, we don't stock pigs trotters. I guess not. No one around here sells them. Hello dear. Dad. Roast pork again? So what? I'm tired of roast pork every day. Then make your own lunches. Why me? Why not? Not many fathers pack lunches. We're a single-parent family. In that case, I'll have 300g of roast pork. OK In a block? Yes, that's better. Pigs trotters, roast pork? Are you from Okinawa? No, I just love pork. Well, you might as well have this. So happy All of that? No problem. Thank you so much. Today's pork is different. I found a new butcher at the market. With the usual different meat stalls You rarely buy cooked pork. Yes, I bought it on impulse. How's pre-med coming along? Today we had to dissect a frog. And get this. While working on it, the anesthetic wore off. The frog broke free and started jumping around. That frog was as strong as a zombie. The vitality of the frog is really strong Didn't you get it? Get what? The frog. Apparently, they taste good. I never thought of that. I think they just buried it. I start work as of tomorrow. If you don't work, you can't eat. Only during the day. So nothing will change. I'm going out tomorrow, I won't need dinner. Who with, and where? Yoko and Kaoru, as always. Shopping in Shinjuku, then a movie. Stick to the shopping district, stay away from the bars. Okay Curfew is 1 0pm. Don't miss it. Stop raving, Mom. Bye Dad. Carefully on the road Morning. Good morning. Is that your lunch? Yes, sandwiches. That's great. Bye. See you. Good morning. Morning to you. I'll be back later. I look forward to it. Bye. Take care. Is that a kind of rice ball? It's a rice dumpling. The same as those we got during the Children's Festival? No, this is a Taiwanese variation. Stuffed with various ingredients. I'll show you. They're wrapped in leaves. It's got prawn, egg and roast pork. It looks delicious. Try some. May I? Go ahead. It looks good. I also want That's delicious. Such a great texture. I cook them bulk and freeze for later. Are you Taiwanese? "Hitoto" is an unusual name. No, I'm Japanese, but I lived over there. So you cook Taiwanese food? Like mapo-tofu? No, that's from Szechuan. But they eat it in Taiwan. Can I get the recipe for this? My kids will love it. Yes, but it's quite involved. We could make it together. I want to come, too. OK I insist you do. How about next Sunday? Definitely. We'll be there. Great Bye, Bye, Mom! Take care, dear. "January 20 Saturday" Roll up, roll up! There's a special on meat all today. Roast pork on sale! Excuse me. Excuse me, Ma'am. Good day to you. You have... Your hair... Behind? God Thank you so much! Really "To Tae" I'm proud that I don't criticize everything you do. But dear Tae, please remember one thing. My duty is to raise my two daughters to become fine young ladies. You and your sister are treasures your late father left me. And I have a duty to return that favor. Please Tae, do not become a daughter who lies to me. Mom, can you make pigs trotters tomorrow? If I can find them. I'll be making a feast, so bring your hidden boyfriend along. There's no hidden boyfriend. I have a variety of boyfriends. You sound like a salesperson. She's very popular with boys. When did you get back? We're always getting phone calls from different boys. You talk too much. But don't worry, I never tell Mom. Enough. Go wash your hands. OK That means you're a lucky girl. This'll be fun. For sure! Shut up. Do not run I do not want stop Can not run around Yu Tai Slice through. A rough cut will do. It is good Really fragrant Coming! Can you take over? I come coming Oh, I'm so sorry. Thanks for this. Bring them in. Will not Please put it here Yes Come inside. Thank you. Sorry excuse me Over here. These are... What's this? This is it I searched high and low to find these. I love pigs trotters. Scary! How do you prepare them? First, give them a thorough clean. It's your turn, Yo. Coming You'll love these. They're delicious. So many. Give her a hand. Impressive. You're a real butcher. Ready! Wait. Okay, cheese. Here. Thanks. I took a photo. Next, we simmer them slowly. Thanks for having us. Welcome. Any of Tae's schoolmates are always welcome. Kuriyama from the Medical department. Onose is a Literature major. Kikuchi studies Commerce. We're all in the ski club Medicine, Literature and Commerce? Yes I want you all to eat your fill today. Thank you aunt Can Literature and Commerce come give me a hand? Please help me for a while We've always got jobs for men to do. Come on Literature, in you come. Yes Please come in That shutter there is always getting jammed. Can you help me? I'm on it. Thank you What was your name again? Kikuchi. Kikuchi students, come over let me tell you... I am sorry Auntie I fixed the shutters. That's great. Thanks. The next job is right up your alley. The bulb at the top of the stairs needs changing. Right away. Enough Mom. You're being rude. Anything for me? We can't have a potential doctor getting hurt. Absolutely can not hurt the hand Just sit yourself down. Mom, you're shameless. This smell reminds me of Taiwan. Smell good ls anyone there? Help... You'll be fine. OK You're my first patient. What an honor. Everyone. The food is ready. It's like being a caveman. You're not eating? No, cooking a feast seems to fill me up. The trotters don't seem very popular. Come on boys, get into them. Don't be shy. Yes I eat Too dainty! Pick it up and gnaw it. What? My tooth. My implant came out. I hate Don't laugh. Okay? God Doctor? Sorry to call on a Sunday. But my implant fell out. He fixed it. Good. Great. I was malnourished as a child, my teeth suffered. Having a dentist as a neighbor helps. He gives treatment on a Sunday. Okay? It looks fine. Sorry about the other night. Bringing Tae home late. I'm to blame for her breaking curfew. No problem, she's over 20. She's an adult. Seriously? Put this in the sink. Something to take home. Lucky boy. For you. Thank you, Auntie You, too. You're always very welcome, Mr Kuriyama. Thank you so much. Okay, see you. Swee you tomorrow See you at work. Bye, Thanks for everything. Take care. See you. Do not make trouble Really thank you very much Mom, why were you fawning over Kuriyama? If you marry a doctor, you can both have your own practices. You'll be financially secure. What? Having two doctors in the family would be great. To complement each other, like gynecology and pediatrics. I can't believe you think like that. I can choose my own husband. I've never even considered Kuriyama. Plus, it's insulting to him. Besides, I haven't decided to become a doctor. Stop being so difficult, will you? And don't count on me in your old age. Trouble first to give it up I don't know if I'll even get married. I won't marry someone because you say so. I've no idea what you're thinking. Yo will take care of me. Unlike you, she's a loving daughter. You got that right, Mom. Are you okay? You didn't eat anything. I'm fine. Just getting older. No, you're not. Tea? I'll make it. Thanks. Please You're her daughter? Yes, I'm the oldest. Please sit down. What I'm about to tell you... Excuse me, Doctor. We're a single-parent family. If anything happens to me, my children will be all alone. My daughter here is studying medicine. Please don't hide your diagnosis, I need to make preparations. I see. Is that alright with you? Yes, I can take it. Right then. We've found cancer in the gastric region and the esophagus. Fortunately, it hasn't spread to other organs. You may get well after resection of stomach. But it will require major surgery. And that will result in extended hospitalization. Afterwards, your lifestyle will change drastically. Doctor. I can't afford to die, so do what you must. Come on Mom. The date of the mother's admission is Mom insisted on attending Yo's graduation ceremony. The very next day she went in for the operation. We both agreed not to tell Yo that Mom had cancer. The surgery took a full 8 hours. They ended up removing her entire stomach. At first they said it'd take 3 weeks. But she was there for 4 months. After many delays, Mom was finally released. Let's go to the butchers. Welcome back. Thank you. I have some for you. Some what? I knew you'd be back, so I put them in the freezer. Pig trotters. I think we'll have some pork mince today. Mince? Yes, how much? 200 grams will do. Don't look so disappointed. I'm not. I'm happy to see you back. Pot Dearest Tae, Happy new year. Thanks for all your support over the last year. They say if I survive for 3 years, I'll have beaten the cancer. So I must ask for your help in this final year. I'll also do my best. I've been very impressed by your vitality. But please don't give up on your dreams. Do your best at school, too. Your Loving Mother That reminds me, Tae. You postponed your trip to Europe for me. You should go now. But, Mom... No, go. You won't get many chances to go abroad. But Yo is going away to music camp. I want you to go. I'm okay. I'll be fine. Go. Mom's illness and hospitalization reminded me of how selfish I'd been. It made me realize how I'd never considered others in my plans. To have Mom always waiting at home for us... Ensured we always felt part of a safe and happy family. "1 993" Mom had a relapse and nine days later, she passed away. It was so sudden there was no time to be sad. Tae. Why didn't you tell me it was cancer? It was a difficult decision to make. You were studying for the college entrance exams. We didn't want to distract you from doing your best. But I never expected Mom would die. Well that proves it. You simply don't trust anyone. There were only three of us. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't want me to worry about her? If I'd known it was cancer... Maybe there was something I could've done to ease her suffering. More I could have contributed. I could have been kinder, more caring. I'm sorry. I can't believe she's gone. It's so sudden. Mom Mother, you too much Don't leave me, Mom. Mother do not go Well Mom Sister Get off me. Don't touch me. Let go. Go away. Mom Tae? Shall we eat? Mom made these. We must treasure them. I'm still changing Again I've wandered into the kaleidoscope I'm the furthest I've ever been from myself And the closest I'll ever be "Kanazawa, 201 6" there? There's over there Mom loved eating this. Yes, I remember. "Yoshikawa Station, Hitoto Township" Weird, isn't it? Seeing our name like that. "Hitoto Family Grave" Thank you, Reverend. Excuse me. Are you Mr Asano? I am I thought it must be you. Sorry to turn up unannounced. No, not at all. May we get an autograph? Of course. What's your name? Kamei. Ms Kamei I found your letters among Mom's things. There is a letter from Mr. Asano Did you read them? Yes, sorry. She left so suddenly, then reappeared just as suddenly. She always left me confused. I want to hear how Mom managed to confuse you. She called me at work, out of the blue. After 20 years of not hearing from her. Excuse me. Excuse me, Ma'am. Good day to you. You have... In your hair. Behind? Thank you so much. It's been a long time. It has. Your order? Coffee please. Certainly, sir. You're working at the same place. I transferred to Osaka for a while, then went back. I see. I spent a long time trying to track you down. Are you still angry? Nothing to do with anger. It's been 20 years, hasn't it? When you first left, I thought you were angry. Has it been that long? It must be. My daughter is about that age. It's gone by so fast. You've lost weight. You were thin back then, you're thinner now. I've been through a lot. I see it in your face. Do I look that bad? You mentioned you have a daughter. Two daughters. I'm a widow. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be sorry about my daughters. They're both smart and and good-looking girls. How about you? I was married once. But no children. You say "was married." Did you divorce? Either I ended it, or she ended it. I just gave up. Like you always did. What do you mean? You lack the ability to learn. In matters of love, men are such amateurs. That's very poetic. A line from a Truffaut film. Women, too. We're also amateurs. I'd better get going. I must make dinner. Reality intrudes. Thanks for reconnecting. I was feeling lonely. I just wondered how you were getting on. And thank you for coming. You can call me anytime. If I get the urge. I wish I could join you. But I'm late for the studio. I look forward to your new album. Thank you. Bye, Sis. Your shad, sir. Eat it as is. Thank you Please We met again just before she was re-hospitalized. A gap of 20 years between dates. You go on You won't get many chances to go abroad. I want you to go. That's why she was so eager to get rid of me. "Amusement Park" We often dated here. You called me a single-minded fool. I was never that nasty. No girl had ever wanted me to take her to the park. I was thrilled. That's why I kept coming back. Back then, I'd never even been on an airplane. I always yearned for that feeling of flying through the air. Is that why you went to Taiwan? I guess so. Maybe I just wanted to go far away. As far away as I could go. Let's go on the ride. No, not today. Really? We can do it next time. I did love you back then. I was too stupid to see it. No, I was too childish. I dreamed about getting married. Sorry. I sometimes ask myself. How would our marriage have turned out? We wouldn't be friends like we are now. Friends, are we? Yes. I guess that's best. I'm full. Finish it off. Thank you. I'll escort you. Let's walk. I want to see the city lights. Sure. You've carried it all night? The thorns have been giving me hell. You silly thing. But thank you. I'm going away. Taking a month-long trip. Where? Far away. Don't disappear on me again. I'm going to Europe. My daughters are taking me. You all seem very close. Then maybe later... You and I could go to a hot spring. Aren't we just friends? Because we're friends. I want us to enjoy ourselves. Dine together and take trips away. I want to enjoy each other's company. I do, too. That would be great. Let's meet up again after I get back. This is the last letter from your mother. May I read it? OK "Sorry that I lied to you." "I wish we could ride the planes at the park once more." "I'm one more thing for you to give up on." I never knew Mom liked amusement park rides. Listen Tae. Why don't you and I go there? The amusement park. OK In the past, I was... Like a kite with a broken string When I turn the hourglass over I recall the memories in my heart And memories of Taiwan Tick-tock Tick-tock What's wrong? Can't you sleep? I'm thinking about Taiwan. Yum Cha and soup dumplings? Chicken noodles, minced pork and rice. Turnip cake, too. "Tainan City, Taiwan" Welcome home. Do you still remember me? Yes, you were this tall. My how you've grown. About your father. He was more Japanese than the Japanese. After the war ended... Taiwan was no longer a Japanese colony. We were finally free again. We believed Taiwan had our independence. We even welcomed the Kuomintang of China from the mainland. But... In truth, they wanted to seize Taiwan. The gap between our expectations and reality was massive. We were very disappointed. Then the military cracked down in the February 28th Incident. Many were arrested and put into prison. The military dictatorship executed many. Some of our relatives were taken, too. Your father was devastated. Politics, and life in general, both depressed him. He suffered major psychological trauma. Huimin... In his mind, your father was very Japanese. The Taiwanese life-style, politics, the economy... Even his own family. He just didn't fit in. He came back from Japan after the war. But that only made matters worse. Mrs. Liu Alas, Mr. Yan you have not come for a long time I brought my daughter back home Yanmiao Miss Yan Miao long time no see Mrs. Liu That right Your father and my husband both attended Tokyo's Waseda University. When you were little, we often visited you at home. Sorry, I don't remember much. Wait a moment. Come, Yan Huimin's daughter is here. Come on soon Really long time no see Welcome Yes, we cooked all these dishes. Get some rubbish and sweet and spicy, and have shochu chicken Well, wait a minute Just like Mom used to make. Can you share some memories of my mother? Of course I remember She was determined to get along with your father's family. When I went to the markets she would follow behind, always taking notes. She wrote them in her notebook. The radish cakes came Mom often made this dish. I remember her telling me how much you loved it. Is that right? Try some. I shall, thank you. "Girl child celebratory rice-wine?" Thank you. In Taiwan, when a baby girl is born we put rice-wine into a pot. Home as long as the daughter was born Shaoxing wine will be put into the urn It remains buried until she is married. Then we dig it up for the wedding ceremony. Then shared amongst all the guests. I remember now. My dearest Tae, now you are mature, both physically and mentally. It's my celebration, why are you two wearing kimono? I want to take a photo. We're celebrating 20 years since I had you. I've fulfilled my duty as your mother. I'll show the photo at your father's shrine. I want to report that I have raised smart, beautiful young ladies. And I'll add that you're very kind, too. I'll be proud to report that to you father. To become a fully mature adult, both in name and reality... There will be much you will have to endure in the future. But now, as a student, you must concentrate on your studies. And remember to always have pride and faith in yourself. Now, I'm double the age I was when I became an adult at 20. Yes, there has been much to endure. But things weren't as bad as you thought they would be. If you were still alive, you'd be almost 70 now. And I have become a mature adult in both name and reality. Everyone says I look just like you. I'll try hard to become a strong and caring woman like you. "Fresh-Cooked Pig's Trotters" Good day. Do you remember me? How could I ever forget? You're Mrs Hitoto's daughter. Yes It's been far too long. So many of the shops here have closed down. Yes, they're building a supermarket here next year. When I heard that, I thought of closing up shop. Then... They offered me the meat section in the supermarket. With my daughter and her husband we could make it work. What a fantastic outcome. My biggest seller. Pigs trotters. I have a lot of Taiwanese and Chinese customers these days. I should buy some, too. And add 300g of mincemeat, please. Well... Someday, when it's convenient... Yes I'd like to offer incense and say a prayer to your mother. You're very welcome. How is it? Terrible. Like a watery pancake. Maybe Mom left out an important ingredient in her recipe. What's missing? You never know how much they love and care for you until they're gone. Dear, Tae and Yo! Dinner is ready!
