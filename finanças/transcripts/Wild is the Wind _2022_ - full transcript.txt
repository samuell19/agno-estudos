Don't worry, it's on the house. [coughs] Are you sure? Yeah, it's nothing. [man 1 coughing] Sure. Thanks, Martin. - And send my greetings to Lizette. - Yes, I will. Are you all right? I'm fine, I just have to cough it up. Otherwise, it continues. Goodbye, uncle. [coughing] Hi, Pa! My darling child, how are you? - Good. And you, Pa? - Good. [in English] Um, is it cool if I sleep over at Elsa and Maureen's tonight? Absolutely not. - But, Pa... - No buts. - [in Afrikaans] Please, Pa! - Don't "Pa" me. You know I don't like that girl. Well, Dad, you don't like anyone. That's not true. - What about tomorrow morning? - I won't be late. [sighs] Yeah, okay. [squeals, chuckling] - [in English] Thanks. I love you. - I love you too. - [Martin in Afrikaans] Need money? - [in English] No, thanks. - [Martin in Afrikaans] All right, enjoy. - Thank you. - And be careful. - [Melissa] Ooh!

Come here. [both] Mm. - Be careful, eh? - Mm-hmm. Vusi... Abby. [in Tswana] You'll be safe? [in English] Always. [in Tswana] We'll be able to get a new TV soon. [sighs] Don't worry, it's not so bad. Besides, we don't have the money for it. [Vusi] Hmm. [in English] You're right. I have to go. ["Wild Is the Wind" by Nina Simone playing] [laughs] Stop.

[clears throat] We're not losing the farm. All right? I made you a promise. And I keep my promises. [kisses] [breathes deeply] [in Afrikaans] Love you. [in English] Thank you. Hey, Vus, has he, uh... Has he agreed on our price? Yeah, she says she'll have it ready for us in a couple of days. "She"? Yeah. - [chuckles softly] - [scoffs] Shit. That's the best news I've heard in months.

[in Afrikaans] Yeah, it's registered under Melissa van der Walt. [in English] Van der Walt? The butcher? Yeah. [sheep bleating] Is there a body? [in Afrikaans] Uh-uh. Not yet. [in English] But we have a few men that've been searching for about two hours. [in Afrikaans] But the veldt and the fucking wind, man. Apologies. [in English] Okay. So she's run off the road, she crashes. Before she knows what's going on, somebody's on top of her. She manages to fight him off. Maybe even hurts him. Maybe. She got away, and he chases her.

Hello, Lizette. Hello. [smacks lips, inhales] - May we please sit? - What's going on? Uh, let's rather sit down. [chair scrapes on floor] [sighs] We were called in this morning to investigate an abandoned vehicle. I don't understand. What do you mean? Whose car did you find? [ominous music playing] - [John] It was Melissa's car. - What about Melissa? What is he saying? We sent in a search party, with dogs, and... I don't understand. What are you saying? Lizette, I'm sorry. We found her body this morning. [wailing] [in English] Baby... [in Afrikaans] Not my child! - [wailing] - [tragic string music playing] Don't you fucking touch me! [in English] Fuck you! [wailing] [sniffling] [choked sobs] [sobs] [in Afrikaans] Wait, Martin. Listen. We're going to find out who did this, and they're going to fucking pay. You have my word. All right? Go well, Martin. [in English] Don't make promises you can't afford to keep. What? Look, you knew her. I'm sorry, that's tough enough. But I'm not changing my plans. I am going to collect the money, and I'm going to leave. I'm not getting involved in a murder case. Just like that, you turn your back on her? Well, it's not your fight. Why must it be my fight? Because I'm a cop or because she's white? It's justice, Vus. Justice? How many Black children were killed this year? How many of their cases were solved? How many of them had the whole department out at 3:00 in the fucking morning? Yeah, I hear you. Okay. Look, at the end of the week, we'll both be rich men. You can save your farm, I can give my family a decent life. So why not let somebody else just take this burden? Hmm? I don't care what it takes. - You find out who did this. - Yes, sir. And if you need more men, I'll transfer them from Queenstown. - Thank you, sir. I'll appreciate that. - Good! Good. You'll hear from my office. [in Afrikaans] What are you looking at? Get to work! Squad room, ten minutes, all of you! [indistinct chatter] [in English] All right, settle down. [Captain in Afrikaans] Thank you, Lewis. [in English] By now, most of you have heard that the victim, Melissa van der Walt, was the mayor's niece. Which means that this case has just turned into a departmental shit storm. It's election year. And the mayor doesn't want to come across as... soft. So he has personally offered a reward to the department of R250,000... - [all murmuring excitedly] - [Lewis] Okay, settle down. ...for the arrest and conviction of his niece's killer. Now, you two were the first senior officers on site. - Yeah. Affirmative. - Yes, Captain. And you knew the victim? I was at school with the victim's father. If you and Vusi want to pass this one on, now's your chance. That's all right, Captain. We'll stay on it. Catch this bastard. John? [hoarsely] Yes. [clears throat] Yes, sir. All right. John and Vusi will take lead and the rest of you will support them in any way that you can. Are we clear? - [officers] Yes, sir. - Good. Now get going. Our small community was shocked by a terrible incident yesterday morning. And before we begin, I would... I would like to send our prayers and our thoughts to the family of the deceased. Thank you. - [woman] Captain. - Yes? [woman] Can you tell us how old was the victim? She would have been 18 in September. I'm sorry to ask you this, but is there any sign of rape? Uh, that is inconclusive at this time. Captain, was anything missing or stolen? Uh, no. As far as we can see, nothing has been taken. - [man] Captain? - Yes. Who will be leading the investigation? Ah, two of my best men. Senior officers. Superintendent John Smit and his partner, Detective Sergeant Vusi Matsoso. [all applauding] [imperceptible] [in Afrikaans] As we say in Afrikaans, these men are on the ball. [in English] Captain? Captain, please, just a few more questions. Yes, of course. Captain, there was a shoot-out at a farmhouse that saw at least three people lose their lives. Why has there been no mention of this? Is it because they are not related to the mayor? There was no mention because it's an ongoing investigation. And we're looking into the cause of the shooting. What about Golgotha Tavern? What about it? Almost every drug-related crime can be traced back there. And yet the tavern has been allowed to continue its operations day and night. There is no conclusive proof that Golgotha Tavern is involved in any way in this tragedy. But wasn't the victim's body discovered not too far from it? The veldt where the body was found borders the township, yes. But that does not mean that anybody from the township had anything to do with this tragedy. [man] She's right. The tsotsis in this township get away with things like murder because somebody in your department... [in Afrikaans] Gerrit, please. Just sit down. [in English] They come from the townships to kill our children! You do nothing. Hey! Who's killing your children? You bloody people! [all clamoring] [gentle piano music playing] [in Afrikaans] You two better get to work, and fast. [music continues] [opens beer] [Abby in English] My love. [in Tswana] I'm in here. [Abby] Mm. - [in English] Rough day, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm? - Mm-hmm. Mmm. [chuckles softly] I'm so proud of you. Why? [breathes deeply] Well, because... [in Tswana]...you and John... give people hope. [in English] You... give me... hope. - Hope? - Mm-hmm. [in Tswana] Were we at the same meeting? - Hmm? - [both chuckling] [Abby groans] [in English] I know that things are usually like this. [in Tswana] But maybe... this time it will be different. [Vusi inhales deeply] [exhales] - [groaning] Hmm... - [Abby] Mm? Mm? Mm? - [Vusi chuckles] - Mm? Mm-hmm? [both] Mm. [Abby] Mm. Mm. [music continues] [both] Mm. [both chuckling] [music continues] [in Afrikaans] We need to establish a timeline of Melissa's last 18 hours. [in English] What time did you see her last? [in Afrikaans] Uh, she came to the butcher shop around half past four, with her friends Elsa and Maureen. She asked permission to spend the night at their place. Did you notice anything strange in her behavior? - Anything she said? - No. No, she was herself. Eager to spend the night with her friends. [in English] Did she have a boyfriend? [in Afrikaans] No. Uh, she dated my employee Hennie for a while, but that's been over for more than year. [in English] Did she have any enemies? Someone that might want to cause her harm? [in Afrikaans] She was barely 18. How the fuck would she have enemies? [John sighs] We're just trying to consider all possibilites, that's all. Is that so? You're wasting fucking time. Go look for the bastard! Get out of the way! - [in English] What do you think? - I think you should have come alone. What? Why? You're joking, right? No, I'm not. Right now, anything that doesn't look or sound like them is the enemy. And to them, I am just as Black as the man that they think killed their little girl. They just found out that they lost their daughter. Fuck's sake! Not everything's about race. [ominous music playing] Hey. Check this out. What have you got? She wears that necklace in every picture, except that one. - Has it been bagged? - Not yet. Oh, well, she could've lost it in the veldt. Mm. Maybe. - [phone buzzing] - [John sighs] Ah, shit. I gotta take this. Melissa was supposed to stay over... [sniffles]...but she never came back from the bar. Which bar was this? The Burning Bush. Did, um... Did something happen at this bar? There was an incident with Melissa and her ex, but... Hennie de Villiers? And what... what incident was this? Hennie and Melissa dated for a while. But she broke things off because he has a temper. How big of a temper? [young woman] He got jealous. And he hit her. Did he hit her last night? [sobbing] [sniffling] Yeah. She was here with her girlfriends. And a few other Black guys. [scoffs] What happened? [sighs] Look. I don't care about the company you keep, as long as you behave and you pay. Money is money. What'd they actually do? They caused problems with some of my clients, so I threw the whole lot out. If you wanna see, I've got it all on camera. So here are the video files, this is according to camera and time. [smacks lips] Thanks, I'll take it from here. [thuds] [people talking in video] Stop right there. Play it again. - Bye. - Bye. - Drive safe. - Drive safe. - Stop. - Who's that? Kop. Hijacking gangster that works for the Russian. Shit. No wonder she's dead. Hey, Vus, what's wrong? - Fuck this shit! - Vusi! Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? - You're a fucking Ka... - Say it. Say it. [John] Vusi... - Say it! - [John] Vusi! Vus, Vus, come on. [tense music playing] Give me a fucking excuse and say it! Vusi... Vusi... Vusi. Vus. Come on. Come on. [John cocks gun, grunts a warning] You want me to shoot some sense in that dumb fuck head of yours, buck. Huh? Mm. Thought not. [in Afrikaans] Go fuck yourself. [dramatic music playing] [John sighs] [sniffs, exhales] [music fades] [in English] You think there's any hope for this land, John? Think we'll ever get past the hate? [scoffs] Past it? Fuck. [wind gusting] That's a big ask. You know, a lot of blood has been spilled in this place. But... I consider you my brother. You know? You're the only oke in the world I really trust, so... that's enough for me. [coughs] [John] Cheers. [gasps] We gotta stop getting this cheap kak, eh? [chuckles] Ah... [indistinct chatter on video] [woman screams] [in Afrikaans] Damn! - [in English] Who's the one with the hook? - We don't know yet, Captain. If he runs with Kop, he's bad news. - [Captain] Mm. - [man shouts in video] All right. This is what I want. Find the guy with the hook and bring him in. Let's start with the ex. [John] All right. [quietly] Please. I didn't kill her. I would never hurt her. Please. I would never hurt her. Is that right? Hmm? Now, what the fuck do you call this? [people screaming in video] Hey? Bet it wasn't the first time, eh, big man? Hmm? You can say what you want. I didn't kill her. So you admit you hit her? I... I mean, I... I lost my temper once or twice. - But that's all... that's all... - Bullshit! I have testimonies from her best friends saying that she was afraid of you, you are violent and you're out of control. - And that, that is why she left you. - No. No. I loved her. - You loved her? - I loved her. Please. Well, now. That there, that's not love. Oh, God. Fuck. - And that? - Fuck. - [crying] - That's not love. - Oh, and this one? Mm? That? Is that love? - Oh, jeez. Fuck. [John] Hmm? This one? You need a fucking therapist if you think that's love. Hmm? - You were jealous. - No. - You ran her off the road, then beat her. - No. To death, in cold blood. Come on, admit it. Listen, just confess. 'Cause you... Vus! Ah, fuck, Vus! Shut up and stop crying! You know, I hate women beaters the most. - [groans] - Now talk, or I'm going to hurt you. [Hennie] Okay, okay, okay! [eerie music playing] After I got kicked out of the bar, I went to a friend's house, Kobus van Jaarsveld. We smoked joints and drank a lot of beer. I have witnesses. I can prove I was there 'til lunch... - What about your hand? - I punched a wall. I was fucking angry! If there's anyone you should suspect of killing her, it's that gangster she left me for. What's his name? Sonnyboy. She called him Sonnyboy. What the fuck were you thinking? I... - I had that under control. - Well, it worked, didn't it? The how isn't as important as getting results, remember? You taught me that. I don't like to shit where I eat, and I'm not losing my job over this kak! You feel me, buck? Yeah. Well, good. [suspenseful music playing] This money's gonna do a lot of good. - What, you're not even going to count it? - I trust you. - [laughing] - [chuckles] That's the best thing I've heard all day. Well, I know how important your reputation is to you. A man's reputation is all he has. What he's done, what he can do. That's all he has. Well, then, never let it be said that I was a dishonest criminal. Hmm. [pats bag] [door opens] [dog barking in distance] So what are you going to do now? I'm thinking about Egoli. Get a fresh start. Oh. That's definitely the place to do it. I could always use people like you. Call this number when you get there. Tell him I sent you. - Just like that? - Why should it be any harder? What do you think? Most cops that work for us have no dignity. They smoke, gamble, alcoholics. But this one, see, this one, he doesn't know what he wants to be. Not yet. I was afraid you were gonna say that. Take the men and follow him. Starting to cost a lot more than you're worth, son. [in Xhosa] Sorry, Uncle Mongo. [in English] I will leave in the morning. [chuckles] [in Tswana] I know I'm early but I couldn't wait to... [object clatters] What's going on? They're fighting, and he's been hitting her. - [woman in English] Fucking coward! - [man] Fuck you, you fucking bitch! [ominous music playing] Dumb, little crying bitch. [man chuckles] You're a fucking coward. That's all you are. You're a fucking coward! [man] Fuck you! Huh? Oh! [laughing] You called the cops. Do you know who I am? Huh? You know who I am? Huh? This is my house. Get the fuck out. - Sir... - Out, get out. - Get the fuck out! Get the fuck... - You need... You need to calm down. Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out! - I need you to calm down. - Get the fuck out! I didn't call him, he's the maid's husband, you fucking moron! - [grunts] - [screams] Look, I am not going to ask you again! Calm down! Is she all right? - Yeah. - [man] Hey, man. Hey. Hey, nobody called you. Nobody called you. Nobody called you! So get the fuck out of my house, or I'm going to go and get my firearm, and I'm going to fuck you up, little boy! - [spits] - [woman screams] [both grunting] [groans] Leave him alone! [grunting] - Who's your little boy now? - Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Leave him alone, you fucking bastard! You fucking animal! [man groans] - [woman] Get out! - [groans] Get out! Get out before I press charges. We need to go! We need to go! [groaning] [grunts] [woman panting] [music fades] [truck idling] [turns off engine] [ominous music playing] [door creaking open] [inhales, shudders] [in Tswana] Vusi, what were you thinking? What were you thinking? You say nothing the whole way home, and now you pick their side? [in English] Ugh, damn it, Vusi! This is not about sides. You could lose your job over this, huh? [in Tswana] I've already lost mine. And what about our baby? Everything I do, is for her! Men like that are a danger to everyone. They deserve everything they get. [phone buzzes] [in English] Yeah? Yeah, I'm on my way. And John? I got it. Yeah. I'll keep it here for now. [in Tswana] What's going on? You need to start packing. We leave for Jo'burg at the end of the week. Goodness, this week? We can't even afford Jo'burg, Vusi. [in English] Vusi, where did you get this? [in Tswana] I earned it. [in English] Well, at least half. How? [in Tswana] We had a few side deals lined up, and... some of them came through. [in English] Were they illegal? Illegal? Do you even know what that... [in Tswana] Don't you dare lie to me! Are you a thief? Did you steal this? [in English] No, I'm not a fucking thief! [in Tswana] Look. It doesn't matter where the money's from. What matters is what we do with it. [gasps in disbelief] [in English] I can't believe what I'm hearing. [gasps] [in Tswana] Abby, look at our country. [Abby in English] Oh, God. [in Tswana] Look at our country. Look at our presidents, our politicians. [in English] Your boss! They're all doing it. Looking out for themselves, lining their own pockets. And now that I'm doing, you wanna judge me? Me?! - Are you fucking kidding me? - [yelps] Are you happy that I risk my life to protect these bastards that think of me as nothing more than a Kaffir? [crying] You know... You know I don't think that. Let's be free, Abby. Let's... Let's be free. Huh? Free from you having to... to sweep their floors, me having to protect them when they sleep, Abby. - [cries] - Abby, Abby... [in Tswana] We can finally have a decent life. Huh? [Abby inhales] [exhales] Vusi... we already have a decent life. [in Tswana] Can't you see? [in English] This... This dirty money is not going to change how they see you. It's not going to change how you see yourself. [gentle music playing] [in Tswana] I am begging you. [phone buzzing] [in English] Please. I have to go. Think about what I said. [in Tswana] But start packing. [chair clatters, scrapes floor] [whispers] Vusi. [grunts] [sobs softly] [inhales] [exhales slowly] [ominous music playing] [in English] Yeah. He's leaving now. No, he left it behind. What do you want me to do? Okay. [in Afrikaans] Welcome, everyone, sorry to keep you out of your warm beds. [in English] Thanks for joining us. [in Afrikaans] There's shit in the water, folks. [in English] And we're choosing the worst possible time to take it out. I'll be the first to admit we've been avoiding that place for too long. But if we don't act now, those bastards will get away with everything, and I will not let that happen. Lewis. All right, based on our recon... [in Afrikaans] We're looking at approximately 200 people. Most under 30, and most will be armed. So remember, we're going in outnumbered, and the last thing we need is another incident. This clown, Mongo, who runs this place, has high connections with the township justice system and the Russians. Behind the scenes, people are buying and selling hijacked cars, goods stolen from homes, guns, drugs, copper wire, you name it. This bastard thinks he's the township's Robin Hood! [in English] Be that as it may, we're not after him and his buddies tonight. Tonight's target is Sonnyboy and Kop. Go get them, guys. [indistinct conversations] You realize this guy just paid us in full. He's going to think we double-crossed him. It's the job. We don't have a choice. Maybe. - What are you doing? - Warning him. I'll see you in the car.

Hand him over, or things are gonna get a lot worse. You know who make police? Township people who want to be middle class. And they'll do it, no matter who they step on. Hey, Vus. These pricks always think they're Robin Hood. You're far from it, buck. - How many people have you stepped on? - Not nearly as many as you, white man. [scoffs] Look, just... give us what we want and we'll leave. This is not about us. Township people get killed and stabbed all the time. Now one white girl gets killed, and you wanna break down my door? I don't think so. Now go. And if you think this is over, it's not. - Take your brother with you. - Whoa. [breathes deeply] [indistinct conversations in distance] [knocking] [in Xhosa] Hey, Kop. [in Afrikaans] Sonnyboy, it's time, my brother. [in Xhosa] Cool. Cool. - [Sonnyboy sniffles] - [banging on door] [banging on door] [banging on door] - [in English] Who is it? - Open up! Police! Run! Drop that fucking weapon! On your knees! [exciting music playing] I'll get the car! Run, Sonnyboy! Run, run! [all shouting] [dog barking] [music softens] [panting] [radio beeps] John... John, he's gone. John? [John] Vusi? Vus, we have him. You shit! - [grunts] Huh? - [groans] [people shouting] You thought you could get away with it, huh? - [grunts] - [groans] [spits] [in Xhosa] What are you looking at? What are you looking at? What are you looking at? [people continue shouting] [in English] He killed the girl, man. - [in Xhosa] This white man is lying! - [John in English] Put him in the van. Get him in the fucking van. [in Xhosa] Hey, Mom, this piece of shit is lying. [John] Get him away. He's lying! This person is lying. - [John] You are lying! - You dog shit! Get him in the fucking bakkie. No, he's lying. He's lying, man! [tense, dramatic music playing] [music fades] - [applause, whistling] - [man] Whoo! Whoo! [in English] Hey, hey. Oh, now, that's for me, thanks. Thank you. Vus, you want a coffee? [knocks] [in Afrikaans] Martin, are you all right? You've been sitting here for a while. [sighs] Sorry, I lost track of time. [inhales sharply, exhales] I'm ready. Okay. Come in. It's pretty. [crying] I'm just going to need your signature on the invoice, then we can begin. You did a good job. Thank you. I'll give you a moment. I miss you. I miss you so much. [sobbing] I'm heartbroken that such a thing has happened. I wish with my whole heart that I could change things, that I could understand for one moment how such a thing could've happened to you. [sobbing] [sobbing] [sobs loudly] [sobs] [sighs] [breathes deeply] But I promise you, my love... I will find him. [voice breaks] [whispers] I will find him. [in English] Abby, I've been thinking. What if I resigned today? [thuds] [chair scrapes floor] [smacks lips] Good morning, officer. [Vusi pants] [ominous music playing] What do you want? See, I can tell. You don't like intruders in your place either. Please. Let her go, she's innocent. [Russian laughing] - [yawns] - [continues laughing] [inhales] Don't you know that when you cross me, I take everything from you? [Abby sobs] But I warned you. I told you they were coming. Yes, but you embarrassed me. And I have my reputation to consider. That's all a man has, right, is a reputation. - Vusi! - Wait! Wait! [grunts] I have money. [Russian] Hmm? You can have it. Giving me back my money won't fix this. Life is going to cost you much, much more. [lock clacking] [Slick] Whoo! - [whistles admiringly] - This one. [sniffs] [exhales] [sniffs] [exhales, sniffs] [whistling] [chuckling] You been busy, eh? How many bribes did this take? Fuck you. Fuck me? Word of advice, from one criminal to another. If you're gonna be forced to stay in hell, don't spend all your time dreaming of heaven. Look where that got you. [groans in pain] [groans] [exhales] [panting] They took everything? All I had. Your share, too. Shit! How the fuck could you let this happen? I didn't let it happen. They held my family at gunpoint! What was I supposed to do? [sighs] [breathes deeply] Can we get it back? No. Not without a fight. Without the force, we ain't getting within ten feet of that place. What a fuck-up! So that's it. It's over. No, no. No, not if we can get that murderer charged. We collect the reward. Still the plan, right? - Let's just make sure he's guilty. - [chuckles] [pats truck] Oh, we will. Trust me, buddy. - So the grandmother says he can't read? - Yeah. Hi, Doc. How's our prisoner? Well, he's got two fractured ribs and a minor concussion, but he should be fine, given time to rest. I must say, I was surprised. Surprised about what? Based on the strike pattern, I thought he'd be right-handed. Your man's a lefty. - Are you saying we have the wrong man? - No. She's not saying that. No, she's not saying that. Either way, we're gonna have to work him over, find out what his story is. Of course. I'll take some blood, see what matches. [John] Oh, well. I didn't kill her. But something happened that night. After we left the bar, we were nearly run off the road by a white bakkie. [in Xhosa] You know he's full of shit. Should have let me kick his ass. Jesus. I can't be disrespected by little boys. You okay? - [in English] Oh, yeah, I'm fine. - Are you sure, babes? - Yeah. - Yeah? [in Xhosa and Afrikaans] I swear if I see that shit again, he's dead. Dead! [in English] Then you'll go to jail. Just leave Hennie, okay? He's not worth it. Babes, does your father know what he did to you? What's... There's a lot my father doesn't know. [eerie music playing] - [in Afrikaans] What's this guy's problem? - What? - What? - Why's he driving on my ass? What's his problem? [music fades] [in English] Can you identify this bakkie? [sniffles] If I saw it again, yeah. It was one of those really big hunting types. And after that, she dropped me off in the township and drove home. You let her go home alone? [in Xhosa] I begged Melissa not to go alone. [in English] Even if I could go back with her to Elsa's farm and walk back to the township. But she said no. Why would she say no? Because she was afraid of her people finding out about us. [John chuckles dryly] I've known Melissa since she was a little girl. And she would never in a million years risk everything for a fuck-up like you. [in Xhosa] You're talking shit. [in Afrikaans] You know fuck-all about Melissa, and you know fuck-all about me. Oh. [in Xhosa] Really? I'm some dumb white man? [in English] You've been in and out of prison since you were ten years old. Hmm? Assault, robbery. You've got a rap sheet as long as my fucking arm. You're a liar and a thief, and now, ungumbulali. A murderer. - John... - No, Vus. I'm not gonna let this boy sit here and lie to us. Melissa gave him a lift out of the goodness of her heart. And as a thank you, he raped and he fucking beat her to death! Fuck you, bro. Hmm? [in Xhosa] Fuck you. I said fuck you. [in Xhosa] Fuck me? - [in English] John! - [Sonnyboy] Fuck. [tense music playing] [in Xhosa] Shit, even if you do that, fuck you. [coughing] [in English] Fuck! [in Xhosa] Fuck you too! Fuck you, you're all the same. - [thuds] - [in English] Ah! Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck. - What the hell was that? - I'm sorry, man. - We can't afford to mess this up! - Said I was sorry, okay? [panting] - So, what do you think of his story? - About the white bakkie? This place is full of fuckin' white bakkies. - So you think he's lying. - Of course he's lying! That's all these little shits can do until they can't anymore. Listen to me. Our only job is to get a signed confession out of him. That is it, okay? Now the sooner we do it, the better. Let's go finish the job. [ominous music playing] [knocking at door] - Vus? - Mm-hmm? - You okay? - Yes. What's that? Oh, it's everything Sonnyboy had on him. Thanks. [mysterious music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [Sonnyboy in Afrikaans] You'll see! That thing will break, bro. [in English] Sonnyboy. Sonnyboy! What do you see? [groans] That's it. That's the bakkie. [in Xhosa] That's it. [in English] That's the bakkie. You're sure? 100%, Detective. 100%. Do you believe me now? Detective, do you believe me now? [eerie music playing] [phone buzzing] [Vusi] Doctor? Yeah. So there is someone else? [suspenseful music playing] [music building] [music fades] [doctor] I've already told Vusi that it's only the semen that matches. John? Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard... heard you. [clears throat] Thanks. [suspenseful music playing] [sighs] [sniffles] [music fades] Don't worry, I'm not here to hurt you. Some food. It's not that good, but I thought you were hungry. [inhales deeply] [exhales] [slides papers] Some paper for you to sign. What paper sign? Well, if you want to get out of here and prove you're innocent, then, uh... [inhales]...your best and only chance is to talk to the judge. It's a request form to speed up your court appearance. You can sit here in remand detention for the next year, it's easy, I... I don't care. It's up to you. [in Xhosa] Do you have a pen? Here's a pen. [smacking lips] [in English] Make your mark there. No, make your mark. I'll do the rest. [in Xhosa] There you go. Thank you. [in Tswana] You're leaving? To my mother's. Why? [sniffles] [exhales loudly] [in English] You know why. - Abby, Abby, Abby... - Don't. [in Tswana] I'm begging you. [in English] Just, please, don't do this. Just wait. Just... Just wait. [in Tswana] Our... home... [in English]...is not safe anymore. [in Tswana] Do you understand that? - [in English] But you're safe... - I really, really thought we were going to die this morning. But you're safe now. [exhales] Oh. [in Tswana] I've got a job waiting for me. What job? [exhales deeply] [in English] I'm going to take over my mother's duties... [sniffles]...because... [in Tswana]...she's getting too old for domestic work. - [in English] But you hate being a maid. - [sighs, chuckles] [car horn honks] I have to go. [sighs deeply] I... I... I need to go. All right. [in Tswana] Please take these. [exhales] Uh... [inhales deeply] I'll call you when I get there. [sobbing] [Vusi in English] So sorry for everything. [Abby sobbing] I know. I know. [in Tswana] I'm going to make it right. I'll get back everything when we get to Jo'burg. [in English] Vusi... [gasps] [sighs loudly] All this time you spent... [in Tswana]...trying to get back what's been taken from you... [in English]...more and more is... walking out the door. [melancholy piano music playing] But when... you are ready... I will be waiting. - [sobbing] - [tragic music playing] [inhales deeply] [sobs] Drive. [sniffles] - [sobbing] - [music continues] [melancholy music playing] [tapping foot sadly] [music fading slowly] So she left you, huh? Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that, man. No... it's for the best right now. - Yeah. [sighs] - At least that's what I tell myself. Mm. Mm! You and the bank? The bank? [chuckles] Ah, it's all good, man. It's all settled. How? [chuckles] You haven't heard? Reward money came through. What? We solved the case, man. I... I tried to call you, but, you know, you've been so busy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sonnyboy confessed? Mm-hmm. Confessed and, uh, signed his little X. No, no, I don't understand. Did the doctor call you? Yeah, she did. And, well, if another match is found, then, you know, maybe they'll drop the charges, but for now, he's guilty, bru. - [shatters] - [echoing] Fuck! - Vusi, what the fuck? - Fuck! - Hey! I thought we were in this together. - Oh, we were, but not anymore! [John] What? Is... Is this about your share? Ugh! [stammering] Come on, man. The mayor paid the money into the account this morning. There'll be 100 grand in your account tomorrow morning, bud. Fifty grand goes to the department, I get 100 grand. It's fucking tax-free! What do you... What? Vus, why the fuck are you acting like this? Listen to me. This whole fucking charade was your idea, okay? And now that it's worked out, you're acting like a bitch. What the fuck? [grunts] Vusi! Fuck you! Did that boy even know what he was signing? [John groans, pants] I'll fuckin' shoot you where you stand, you piece of shit! [John gasping] Now get the fuck off my farm! [John shuddering] [inhales, groans] [panting] So there it is. The real you. What? You're suspended, you piece of shit! Fuck off! [panting] [inhales, groans] [panting] [tense music playing] [mournful music playing] [sniffles] Melissa... [in Afrikaans]...she loved this time of day the most. Yeah. Yeah. [gentle piano music playing] - [breathes deeply] - [breath shudders] [Melissa in English] He stands between the gloom, charmed... by a flight of the imagination. The phantom angel-man breaks his mask... and sears his hesitancy. Revered for his valor... [Sonnyboy sobs, sniffles] ...he walks with her through the narrow chamber, hands clutched. [Sonnyboy sniffling] [Melissa] Hey. Babe? [sniffles] - Can you hear me? - [hopeful music playing] And below the cotton sky in their cocoon... they lay snug. And recount the eclipse of their souls. Seated... [echoing]...on the rim of time.

Three years ago, you and I took a bribe that cost an innocent girl her life. - Are you wearing a fuckin' wire? - I'm not trying to burn you, man. Look, the same guy we let go then is the same bastard that killed Melissa, Wilhelm Jooste. His DNA matches the skin samples found under her nails. [officer] Is everything all right?
