'Due to Avalanche, there's been an abnormal incident we're looking at right now.' 'This has become a challenge to the rescue team itself.' When did you last see, Dev? Which camp did you last check-in? I'm asking about Dev, tell me where is Dev? 'In the process of looking for Dev Ramalingam, a Tamizh Adventurer the rescue team is rushing on a helicopter.' Copy! Copy! Not able to proceed-- 'cause of a troubled line. -What happened? -Sir, we can't go further Alpha: returning back to base. Damn! Sir, the wind is too strong. Meghna! Samosa! Damn you Samosa, it's getting late for the show open the door. Ah...I'm coming! What the hell are you doing? Ey---everyone is waiting for you. 'Nisha is Vicky read yet?' Ya, he just opened the door, hold on a sec Thought of reviewing movies like Blue Sattai, but it ends up as a complaint-- --at commisioner's office. So I moved on to speaking about internet videos... -Ey--enough of rehearsing-- -Do you guys agree? --how long will you rant the same thing. Let's go. I had asked for an apple juice, where's it? -What did you ask? -Apple Juice! -Apple juice is it!? -Fine, let go-- -at least try something new today, come on -I'm coming dammit! Woohoo! Greetings to one and all! 'You haven't been Vicky's show right, it'll be awesome.' You must be really worn out working throughout the weekdays just to have a good laugh during the weekend a very Good Evening to all the humble souls who have bought tickets to this show. "Vicky Pechu League" [Vicky Banter League] Even if we're divided between wealth, caste and language there's just one emotion, which brings us together. What emotion is that? INDIAN! Indian-uh!? I'm pretty sure, he's a die hard fan of Arjun since childhood That's not it. only emotion which binds the youngsters of India together these days is-- --ENGINEERING! Woohoo! The applause is strong, I can't help but shoot this question is there a soul who hasn't pursued Engineering? Brother! Intelli-Head! You're not fit to be a Tamizhan, buddy. What did you even pursue, if not Engineering? Hotel Management! Hotel Management So you were drawn to "on the job training"-- you rock, buddy! While I was wondering about the topic for the day-- --there's no use to banter on GST, Petrol Price in no ways this will elevate our standard of living or am I going to become a Chief Minister? So, I'm going to tell you guys a short story A story about a person, who I never wished to meet in life. His name is, Dev Ramalingam! 'I met him at a very strange place and he's a unique person.' 'Kids are bound to cry on the first day of the school but he came in smiling and wiped our tears.' 'When we thought becoming his friends, we came to know our birthdays were on the same date.' 'Obviously, we became best friends.' 'Do you know what he says, if we ask to copy his homework?' You're my friend, but I can't do this. Homework should be done on your own it's not something you can copy. 'Before we could cut ties with him-- --spur of the moment, he'll do something and impress us.' Ey---didn't you finish your homework? I finished homework for my sake but got chucked out for you guys. 'Who is he dude? Fine let that go.' 'It's always fun being around him doing naughty stuff-- --being a girl, she'll getaway with things but I'll get tangled in his heroism antics.' Madam, your daughter doesn't seem to finish her homework did you even check with her? Sorry Sir, I'll make sure to keep a tab on it. I totally understand your problem, Menaka it's really hard to be a single mother. What I'm trying to say is-- Sir! Men right? We're here for her. Am I right, Mom? 'Damn it, dude. Why do you have to churn a punch line to him?' 'Thought will try and move away from there' 'He won't let me go' 'Cause of him, I used to get screwed royally by him.' That's when I learned a truth-- cat and tiger may look the same when they're young but the issue lies when they grow up. 'NCC, SCOUT, Running, Trekking he'll make me do everything to shed the calories.' I thought I'll get rid of him after school but he ended up in the same Department at college. 'Lord save me' 'I grew up being Dev's friend, and lost my identity people were not even aware of my name.' 'They used to troll me "Topper's friend Joker". It'll be embarrassing.' Finally thought if I'll get rid of by doing a job unfortunately I did Engineering, getting a job was tough. Three years passed just looking for a job. 'But he used to make money by going on a adventure and photography -'But at my own sweet shop-- -Useless! I was not even fit to knead the dough for Samosa' 'That's when God blessed me, by sending MBA application to study abroad.' Dad, people are not diabetic abroad. If I pursue higher education there-- --they'll grant us loan to open our franchise out there. Yayy! 'For the first time, I managed to get away from his clutches Mr.Vignesh Perumal, my name was announced on the last call for boarding' But when I arrived there-- --I was shell-shocked! The person who I was running away from-- --he arrived there too and received me yelling "Surprise!". It was him who sent that application. When I heard that-- --I realized there's a reaction in between laughing and crying 'That means, you don't really like him?' 'Listen, I like him a lot.' 'There lies the issue.' 'What kind of issue, brother!?' 'Hold your horses, brother. I've just begun to narrate.' 'Once we were done with our final exams-- --I was drunk and sleeping in peace, where are you taking me? Surprise...! I'm getting impatient, are we there yet? Start a countdown-- --we'll be there. Aa..ah..One! Damn it, do a proper count 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1... Ey--why are you holding me back? Happy Birthday, Buddy! Happy Birthday, Da! -Happy Birthday, Da! -Happy Birthday, Di! Happy Birthday, Di...! -Aye... -Enjoy! Oh no....!!! Buddy, I don't have guts to do it you push me over. Get lost! Ey---get up damn it. Was it exhilarating? -We just started... -Ey, our ties.. ...are no more to cherish. Throw that blanket and get lost from here. Don't laugh, damn it. Hey! The bears will be here, let's move. Those bears are way better than you I rather live with the bears -for God sake, get lost from here. -Here, take this -Bloody, Samosa get up -Ey-- --I really don't get you You go trekking, when you're happy so do you when you're sad too. -Even you drink on both the occasions -Bonjour! -We never ask... -I won't even if you do Bonjour! Did you say, Minjur? Oh, wow! My birthday gift has arrived. It's time to impress her. I'm a Complan Boy! -262..! -Keep it coming ...263 -Hello! -295 -Do you have water? -Yes! -Samosa, it's embarrassing -Get up, damn it. -Get lost! Thank you! Ey..! -What does she want? -She was asking for water Was she asking for water all this while? Mmmm, she's asking to tag along with us.

Who is he to refuse-- -I'll take her along -Ey...! -you're getting yourself into #MeToo -Hello Baby! -I'll take you, please wait. -He's gone mad. Ask him to drive. -Eh! -She's coming with me -Ey--I thought we cut ties -Point! but now he's asking me to drive Poor thing she's relying on us, and has no clothes to change how can we leave her in despair. Ask him to drive. Fine, he's eager. Come on buddy. -Fine, come on. -I love you! Why are you a floozy?

But all the stars look alike. It's not all the same. Puravi, Adupu, Yeral there are a total of twenty seven kind. Mmmm...! Is he still upset? I think so. Wait, I'll check on him. Ey---enough with the booze. Ey--let go damn it. You both have hexed me. Ey--don't be ranting. I'm not ranting, I'm telling the truth. You have your Mom, who'll do anything for you. And his Dad, is the coolest. But I have no one who would do something for me. Even without studying, you guys score good. But me, in spite of studying can't score. Don't be an idiot. I am an idiot! That's the reason, you guys let me tag along. 'Cause when I'm around, you guys look the best. 'Cause I'm dark, fat and fit for nothing. Ridiculous! You've been whining all along get down...get down, damn it. -Let go off me -Come over here Let go damn it, he's the reason for everything What's your problem now? I don't like this way of living Like what? Lurking around places without any fear or seriousness. I can't be like how you are. Did I ever ask you to follow me? You didn't! Fine-- --how do you want to heed your life? A respectful job which pays really well party during the weekends I wanna settle down with a beautiful wife. That's great buddy, your way seems to be unique. Oh, so my dreams are a joke to you. Damn sure it's not a joke There are different kinds of people in the world whether you like it or not work at a dead end job earn and save a ton of money end up buying things we don't need with crude EMI's and GST. This society which expects you to be and live a way, is one kind. Do you see them sitting there? lost in their will. They're high and looking for a different world. They're one kind. Us humans are born to explore competition, pressure, ego these things are imposed by the society. Let's not get tangled. A job beyond fame and wealth, which let's you be in peace and joy. That's the job for you. You should go looking for it. I have no such desire. Who said so? You can turn anything into a comedy. There are a million here to make people cry. You make them laugh. When you're outraged and fighting with someone imagine how angry you'll be, when you're asked to do comedy. He preaches a philosophy though happiness is like wind life, if spread like wings happiness will grace you with open arms. But I understood one thing-- --no matter what I do, I can't get rid of him. But what if he gets rid of me? A man always bows down to women. Got it! Got it! Got it! Got itttt!!! If you're there, get lost damn it. Bloody buffalo, annoying and disturbing my sleep. Look here-- Wanna experience the life to fullest, you've to do it right You're not doing it right Hey, what's your problem now? Buddy, you gotta fall in love. Ey...Samosa! Why are you so concerned about him? I-I-I-I've been always concerned about him. but now is the need for it to be expressed. Buddy, love is an amazing feeling. Isn't that the other half of the life? Buddy! I think-- -Ey... -Hey! I think he has a point. Wake up, damn it. You like adventures love is nothing less than a adventure. Thank God, she got the drift. That's fine--- ---but I need to find the right girl. -We'll cross that bridge when it requires. -You're correct though -now let me sleep in peace. -Oh no she messed it up again -Ey...wait! -It won't happen on its own You've advised yourself, that seekers are winners we'll have to seek out. Why are you seeking out for me? I saw a spark in your eye, when the word "Love" was mentioned. Buddy, come on get up. -Hmm!? -Mmm-hmm! Idiot! Stop annoying me. -Friends are the ones who realize this -You both have gone mad where are you going? -We're going to find the ONE for you -I'm coming too Let's login to Facebook, and start hunting Really!? Facebook and relationship? Don't be so skeptical these days info about girls on Aadhar card is less compared to the info available on Facebook and Instagram. Just send one request take this I can't send request to a stranger Hey...it'll be thrilling. -Ya! -Just shut up. Buddy---I'm just asking you to send a request. She'll accept, if she likes you. If not she'll reject you. If she accepts, drop a "Hi" if rejected, just bid goodbye. If she replies, then chat with her -If you like her, then make... -Ey...! I just went with the flow. School kids are nailing it these days. What's your problem? Just login, damn it. -Come on do it -I can't do it. Just wait and watch-- "I love adventure" isn't that your password? How do you know that? I'm sure you won't have "Floozy" as your password give me my laptop -Ey--don't fight guys -Hey, give it back damn it Ey---give it back -I'll thrash you bugger. -It's gonna break -Let go guys -Get lost, it's my laptop Ey! -Stop, dammit! Ey! Look here, let's come to a compromise we'll countdown 10-1 among friends suggestion Whoever is #1 if that girl seems interesting, then we'll proceed. if not, you should stop bugging him with this. Council! I'm on board. What about him? He's on board too. Ey, now you too are being ridiculous. Sounds interesting, let's give it a try Hey, this feels like I'm being scrutinized by an astrologer. Ey---let's give it a try. Ten Nine Eight Seven -It's full of men profiles -Six -gotta hook him up -Five -Oh God...Oh god! -Four -Oh God...Oh god! -Three -Oh God...Oh god! -Two -Oh God...Oh god! -ONE! Oh no...there's a profile for a dog here. Come on buddy, give me the laptop. I'll message, "Tommy I love you" Ey---this doesn't count. -Let's start over. -He's right. Just like she said, this is #1 that's it, we're done. Dot! Ey---please let's do it. Dev! What happened? What are you looking at? Hey...! She's so pretty. She is...so pretty!? -Ya! -The fish has caught the hook Meghna... Padmavati uh! What's wrong with you? Nothing much, but the name sounds weird. -Oh no! -Do you feel so? No, no, no... Meghna Dev Padmavati it sounds really classic. congratulations! First send her a friend request -Hey...! -It went... Good Morning! -Good morning, Ma'am -Good morning, Deepti What's the agenda for today? Ma'am, now we have a product development meeting later at 11am, we have a meeting with the investors. -Is Harish here? -Ya, he's here ma'am. Ok! Morning! Hey Meghna, sorry couldn't take calls for past two days. That's fine. -Morning! -Good Morning! Morning! -Morning...Good Morning! -Good Morning! So, let's start Meghna, there's a lens box in front of you wear those lenses and see Trust me, you'll be surprised. Hereafter to take a picture, you won't need a camera or a mobile phone to capture the beautiful moments without missing on it this lens will be more than enough. Thank you! So, what do you think, Meghna? Very interesting idea we can make a lot of money. But let's not do it. Why? Many will be affected by this-- --taking pictures or videos without ones knowledge and destroying their privacy. We'll become a tool for that. Ma'am--what if the same idea as Hairsh is conceived by someone else? Not just anyone Even ABC corporation can launch this product next week possibilities are infinite. Am I right, Harish? Ah---how would I know? Weren't you there last Saturday? You must be aware. How much did they offer? Come on tell me, no issues. They offered twice than I draw here. Good, I think you should take the offer. Meghna! You're overreacting getting hurt, by falling into pit is common sense. it's foolishness to see if you get hurt after falling into the pit. I don't wish to be a fool. Your contract will be canceled and the settlement will reach you by evening. You can leave. Meghna, I'm the CTO of this company no one's skilled enough, to handle the product launch next week. I can do it! You're firing me, 'cause I went to the interview? I did, 'cause you broke my trust. Shall I give you a good news? It's been six hours, since he spoke to us. Look at him-- --he's running on the treadmill confused I'm off the hook now. I don't understand. You won't understand. This has been my dream for ages. Hold on, I'll be back. What's up, buddy! Looks like she accepted your friend request. What did you say? You seemed to be in a romantic moo-- "Ecstatic Panda Dance" Damn it, were you dancing to this stupid track Ya, so what? What's wrong with you? I went through a lot and found that girl for you instead of focusing on her, you're stuck on this Ey, Samosa! Let it go! He's not interested, why are you imposing? Buddy, you're right. That girl is not right for you, I'll cancel the request. Why!? Why do we have to cancel the friend request? -Obviously -First, give me that iPad. Anyways you're not interested. She hasn't accepted the request yet. She hasn't accepted it yet? Give me that. Oh God, no! Ey--she's definitely not a match for you Why is that? She lives in America. What!? America!? So what if she lives in America? Oh! So are you going to hop on with guitar and venture to America? I'll whack you, damn it. You won't just take the guitar-- --you'll drag us along too. This won't work out. Just not that buddy, this is a fake profile. This is not how someone looks. They've photoshopped the picture. Look at the name-- "Meghna Padmavati" The name doesn't have a good ring to it. Facebook isn't working out for you. -Where's your mobile phone? -For what? Just give it.. I found it. Ey--what are you doing? Aren't you ashamed peeking into a guys mobile? -Get lost -Get lost, damn it. Give me a smile. Ah...that's enough! Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok... -Ey, what are you doing? -OK! It's tinder, dude. We'll look for a girl within 10 kms and hook up Look here, speed dating won't work out for me. Cancel that thing. Have you ever done speed dating. Have you! Have you! You haven't right? Thought as much. People are struggling to get one like lot of women are pinging you. You're a lucky fellow, damn it. Chances are, you might meet your angel. Come on, let's leave. -Ey---Ey! -Come on. -Keep moving. -This won't work out. -Just listen... -Don't think too much, just go Go! Go! Be quick! Thank God! Ey, Samosa! Back home there's a name for such a behaviour. Ah---it's the same name back at my native too. But to make him budge, I don't mind doing it. Hi! See, I don't believe in love-- --that's why I'm on tinder. Love can hurt, you see. Are you ok with casual sex? -Ey--stop damn it -Ey--Ey! Stop right there, you said it's dating but it turns out to be mating. Stop there, damn it -I'm gonna kill you -I set you up with 10 girls but you returned with no play you won't be spared for this grave sin Ey---open the bloody door. -if not I will whack you -I won't open it This is not fair If I talk about work, you stress on adventure but if I hook you up, you rant about culture. Just listen to me closely now-- At present, not only here even back home, this is the trend. What are you calling a trend? Wham! Bham! Chuck! is not the trend. You hold on to your patience. don't jump into haste Fall in love when you're 60 and get married at 80 then sit on the bed during the night and just gawk. Look here, sex is not everything in life. There's living snuck in between dating and mating. You'll be sharing everything from your life with her. First learn to respect them. When you look at a girl, think with your head not your pants. Mr.Buddha, be a man. What do you mean by that? Having sex with every girl you meet is not a man. Ey! Listen, don't force me into this anymore. Love should happen eventually it can't be forced or convinced to happen. Ey---just think logically. Are you going to stay single throughout your life? Why would I stay single? I have you guys, my friends. Oh God, no! -He's starting again from scratch -Nisha! Why is she not taking the call? -Where did Nisha go? -No idea! It's 12 am, damn it. Nisha, please dear -I've realized my mistake -Don't show me your face anymore -Get lost -Please talk to me Who is that? Nisha! -What happened Nisha? -Hey, stop! -Nothing! -Hey you! Stop! -nothing happened, let's go -Ey -Nisha!? What do you want me to say? Twenty years ago he abandoned us, stating I was not born to him. Now that he's grown old, his love for us is pouring in -He's asking me to stay with him -Ey, is that your father? He's doesn't fit the bill, to be a father. Fine, what did you tell him? I told him, I won't. No matter what happens, I won't go back to him. Why did you do that? What else do you expect me to say? Are you asking her, to go back to him? Why not? You're angry, 'cause he was not there for you, when needed. But you're repeating the same mistake. Ey! Are you taking his side? I'm not taking his side. Think about it-- --why should he comeback looking for you now? It seems, there's no heir to his wealth. He wants me to be his heir to the wealth. You men make mistakes as you wish but us women should come running, once called. Ey---I didn't mean it that way It's fine, if you don't wanna accept the person, who has realized his mistake but please don't ignore him. 'After that Nisha got back with her father.' -Fine, let it go. -This is the reason... no matter how much I hate him, I can't getaway from him 'Success calls for a party everyone was happy graduating' 'And was busy partying' 'Don't even try looking for me here 'Cause, I'm not there.' Hey, how come you're calling me? Don't be kidding Dev. You were suppose to send pictures and videos. Why haven't you sent it yet? I didn't get paid for the previous gig yet If you're freelancer, payments will delay I've been offering you a job since 2 years -You better take it. -I'll think about it. I can only think about it after 6 months Why? I'm planning climb Everest, heading for training. Have you gone mad? It's risky. Many have died in an Avalanche over there. Hey Dev, there's been an issue -Not an adventure but Suicide -I'll call you back -What happened? -They're beating up Vicky. -Come on, let's go. -What the hell? 'How can he do this to Rosie?' Buddy, come on beat them up. Buddy, the Police is here...run! Run samosa run, we're dead if we get caught. Why the hell are you making me run? Hey, stop guys..that's enough. Stop! -Did they hurt you bad? -Yes! Ah...that's ketchup though. They started beating me up while I was eating. -what did you do? -I didn't do anything -Ey...! -Ah...ah! You know Rosie right? Yes I do. She was with George during the 1st Semester 2nd semester, she was with Anthony. 3rd semester, she was with David. Fine, once the course is completed, thought she might need a companion so asked her, if she can hook up with me? -Damn you! -So they came to beat me up. -They shouldn't have beaten you up -Ya! -Instead should've killed you -Damn it, don't. I knew it is wrong but doing something which is forbidden is what makes us boys from Tamilnadu rock. I'm no different. I made a mistake that day. when he was all romantic-- --I should've take him to America and abandoned him I should've arrived at San Fransisco airport but landed at Chennai airport fearing when the scaffold break on me. I was wondering during the flight, how come he's so happy all the time there were people waiting at the airport for his grand welcome. -Mani! -Don't touch, damn it. -That's my Boss Jr. -What is all this, Mani? Everyone should know, you've arrived. A father, who perceives everything positively. Velu, how long have you decided to stay like this? Let the kids explore. World is not constrained to man made walls. Don't scare yourself and turn the kids coward. -Hiiii! -Hey dear, how are you? -Dev uncle is here -Bunked college is it? This is their tide! Dad! To sum up, a perfect and a beautiful family. Not everyone can get lucky. But, he too had a weakness. His, Mother! 'She passed, when he was born.' 'She used to take everyone's picture. you can't find her any of the pictures.' 'This imaginary sketch he drew, remained as his mother.' 'He was raised by his father, that's why he's naturally courageous and strong.' Oh no, dear please wipe your tears. Now walk in with no fear. Your friends are waiting for you inside. you should be smiling always 'His father didn't want him to miss his mother-- --he put the umbilical chord in this locket and gave it to him. 'Anyways, Interesting part of the life is uncertainty.' something I had wished for, is about to happen.' Excuse me! Excuse me, please! Ya, thank you. Eh...Ah! Hey...Hey! Hello! -Ey..buddy! -Tell me.. I just saw her Idiot, who did you see? Mohana, damn it. Mohana uh? That's right, your bear girl. Bear.... Is it Meghna? Exactly, I'm following her at the moment. -Is she in Chennai? -Yes! Come, if you believe me. If not laze at home. Ey---I'm coming right away. Where are you? Dev...! -Bye aunty, I'm getting late -Wait, wait... Where are you running off to? I have something important to tend to Is it more important than meeting me? Oh no...! I'm going to find a match, I'll get back and speak to you. Always kidding around. When are you going to take over the business? Oh no! -Son! -Yes, Dad. Your phone is ringing, pick up. Seems like you're headed for something important, carry on. I'm leaving, Dad. -I love you, Dad. -Be careful, dear. Lingam! If you keep encouraging him like this-- --in the end, he'll end up doing nothing in his life. First, ask him to take over the business. Geetha! Our only job is to teach them how to walk. You should never hold back, who wants to grow up and run. Nisha, where are you? I'm right here, following her. I know that, where are you right now? I'm heading towards, Mount Road. I'm on my way there too, will be there in 5 minutes. Come sooner. Hey, where are you? Hello, I've reached Mount Road signal I'm there too. -where are you exactly? -I'm next to Spencers I'm out there too I'm not able to spot you. Ey---my signal turned green I spotted you, I'm coming Hey...fool! What's wrong with you? What happened? A guy blocked my way What car is she riding in? She's riding in a blue color Mercedes. If I had gone a bit faster, could've caught her. Damn, I was this close and missed her. Dev! De...Dev! Dev! are you there? Ya, Mom! I'll see your soon, Ya! Hey---move the car! Move, damn it! Don't you have any sense? Are you crazy? Have you gone blind, damn it? Sorry! How are your even driving? Damn! Seems like you're love struck. A right age for the feeling though not at all wrong It'll be great if you could pull over and not block the traffic. I got it! There's one, their house has one too. Tommy, a dog. Who is that person with Tommy? Padmavati! It's Meghna Padmavati, damn it! I'm pretty sure, she uses Jio Sim. 'Cause she's online 24/7 also she checks-in wherever she goes. So, if we get hold of her. We can reach Meghna too. Proposing to a girl and making Rasagulla are the same. Rasagulla can't be made with good milk it can be prepared only from spoilt milk. So, when you speak to her, maintain your dignity. Understood? Hey Tom... ...damn, it's Meghna's mother. -What do we do now? -Oh no! Hi aunty! Hey--it's Meghna! Oh no, it's Meghna! Mom, I've been looking for you. Why are you guys scared, come on get in. I missed you too. So good to see you. -Buddy, talk to her -How was your journey? -Good! -I can't over here Turn around and give a smile -"I like you very much -We'll leave in 15 minutes do you like me too", ask her.

Buddy, just stick to what we'd discussed. -Hey! -Hi! Who are you? Dev! What do you want? A small request What!? to your Facebook few days ago, I had sent a friend request. you haven't accepted it yet. It'll be great if you could accept it. Do you know me? Do I know you? Not yet. But we can get to know. Everyone is a stranger, before being friends. Oh! I don't have time for all this. Anyways, let's see your luck I'm leaving in two minutes trying finding and accept it. 'Four thousand friend requests' 'It's all men, damn it' 'Bloody traitor!' 'I'll take care of you later' Buddy, don't let her go 'list is long and doesn't seem to end' -Oh no! -Time is up! -Oh no! -Samosa, your idea flopped. -Unfortunately. -Listen, so what If I couldn't find it. Why don't you send a friend request-- --I'll accept it right away. Meghna! Dev, Meghna's mom has updated that there's a product launch tomorrow Let's go there. Tell me something, why do you like her? Her eyes! There's arrogance in her eyes but there's something beyond it can't really explain though. But that's what excites me. Good. I've never seen you confused-- Something tells me, she's your girl. Let's give it one more shot. She's right buddy. Even if you don't feel like-- --at least give it a shot for my sake. It's all 'cause of you. Thank you! Good Morning! Language! Right from telecommunication to Governing a country it's the most important tool for a human being. But how many of us-- --can learn or speak another language easily? Many such questions came up-- --also we found a solution to it. In this world, no matter who it is-- --using this device you can speak in your mother tongue and communicate. And it'll translate their language-- --and relay it in your mother tongue. That too in split seconds. I would take any questions if you have? How far do you think, it will be successful in India? Our country has the diverse set of languages in the world. approximately 150 languages. Even if 1% is used, it's a success. Brilliant! 'Buddy, ask her if we can listen to the radio on it?' Hi! I went online and searched to know more about you I couldn't find anything else but your work If you could tell us about yourself people who are always thinking of you I mean, like a role model also the people who like to speak to you and get know you you know for business purposes -Get to the point. -That's right! You've achieved so much by the age of 25. I feel this question is not relevant at the moment. Why? But madam, youngsters who aspire to grow in their business your reply will be an inspiration. So, please tell us about yourself. Yes madam, please. Ok! I was 5 years old my mother and I had gone abroad with a person who is not fit to be called as a father. A trip which we imagined will be a joyous one turned our lives, upside down. That man, abandoned us both and ran away. We didn't have our passports. neither we had money nor we knew the language. They detained us in that country-- --and locked us up in a refugee camp. My mother Padmavati, used to work really hard. but just for my sake, she always wore a smile She's my only inspiration. I wanted to help my mother. But to work over there-- --I was not old enough neither I had the strength While I was wondering how to help her out-- --that one answer I figured was Language! People out there had tough time communicating. I started to work as their translator. I don't get paid though but I used to get a piece of bread for hunger That marked the beginning, for the company and the life I have right now. Do you really think she will get impressed? Definitely not possible. Now it's clear, why she isn't interested in you. -Come on, let's leave -Let's go She literally hates the entire race of men. Ma'am I have a question! Ma'am I have a question-- --but, my colleague is going to take your question. -Deepti! -Yes, ma'am Hey, stop! Who the hell are you? and why are you stalking me? Don't you have anything better to do in your life? Guys like you are a disgrace. Meghna! Control yourself. It's fine, aunty. She has every right to be angry. I did come after her. I swear, it wasn't to stalk or to disturb. I saw you and liked you very much. Thought of telling you the same, that's why came after you I won't disturb you anymore. What you've achieved is not a simple thing. Congrats! Bye! Whatever! Ma! come let's leave. Ey--you've been hogging and listening to music aren't you upset? He's being a sport it seems. I saw and liked her a lot. Gave it a shot, it didn't work out. Just like how we have the right to try-- --she has the same right to reject it too. Ya sure, she does. Fine, what's next? Ah...I'm gonna drop you guys and leave. That guy doesn't seem like a bad person. Who are you talking about? The guy who you yelled at in the morning. Mom, please don't do this to you everyone is a good soul. He found me on Facebook and developed a liking right away. he's jobless and have been stalking me so filmy! Incorrigible! If a boy likes a girl-- --it's not wrong to express it in one way or the other. Mom, why are you being so supportive of that guy? I'm not taking his side. I trying to say, you need a companion. Do you think you'll get by without a companion? People who have endured being lonely will know its pain. In my life, relationship didn't work. But it not only affected me but you too. I'm sorry! Now why are you getting emotional? Don't think, you'll endure the same like I did. Don't judge a person without knowing them. Just 'cause a guy goes after a girl-- --he can't be considered being desperate. Who knows, he might turn out good. I agree, that can't trust everyone we meet. That doesn't mean, we should stop living. Choose someone talk to him chat with him Get to know him well. Your choice could be anyone. I will support you. I'm done cooking, let's eat. Damn, what is this? -It's become a routine... -Aye...damn it Stop raising your voice -my life is a mess -you're drunk and beating me up On top it, this trouble was born to us. -Just get out of my house. -Stop it! Beep. HELP! Ey--she's getting away, catch her. -Buddy, she's running -Come on, catch hold of her -Stop, damn it -Ey...Ey! Help! Hey, hey...stop! Hey, hey...don't. Hey...come on, let's leave from here. Are you alright? They left. Let's go. What's it? Did they run away? Ya, they ran away. She's from our locale you can leave, we'll take care of her. Oh she's from your locale? No issues, I'll manage. Come on. Get lost! Get inside. What are you staring at? Kill him, damn it. Hey, you too go on.. Hey...! He made a mistake, so I hit him. If you guys let me go--- ---I'll take the girl and be gone from here. If we don't!? I'll still take her, even if you don't. But one thing, you guys won't forget me forever Arrogance---is it? CONFIDENCE! 'Ey-Ey-come on, drop it-- --come on, let's scoot from here.' Are you ok? He betrayed me in love. If it's not for you, I don't know what would've happened. If not me, it must've been someone else. Many did notice, but chose to ignore. Only you stopped your car. Not sure why, I feel really safe around you. Will you be there for me? Sure, sister. What's your name? Krithika! Krithika, you're really pretty. You seem like an intelligent and bold women. Let me tell you something, never force yourself into a relationship. Just 'cause one betrayed you-- --you'll end up accusing every man you meet. You'll be irritated with the notion of a man. But then one day, a true and an genuine man will come into your life as you were betrayed before you don't have to miss out on him. Don't worry about what happened be happy. You have a lot of time. Ok! Ok. I'll get down here. What is your name? Dev! -Thanks a lot -Fine! Ey---look at her all calm, as if nothing happened. Hey Krithika! I did tell you, this is risky and not to do it. If at all we had been caught alone, imagine what could've happened We didn't get caught right? Don't get cocky 'cause nothing happened. Nope, I'm happy that I met a real man. Take this, upload it right away. A young girl who got stuck with anti-social elements Dev Ramalingam saved her with utmost courage has gone viral on social media. Safety of women after dark is an impending issue also there's accusation of people who don't come forward to help Hey Dev, wake up. -Wake up, damn it -Hey...! You're a talk of the town but you're sleeping out here 'Never force yourself into a relationship' 'Just 'cause you were betrayed --you'll end up accusing every man you meet.' You'll be irritated with the notion of a man. -what is it? -You nailed it. 'But then one day, a true and an genuine man will come into your life' if you end up not trusting him.' Have no sense, where to place a camera. You haven't changed in spite of advanced technology. Muthulakshmi, my son-in-law is on the TV. -I'm leaving to office. -Ok fine Hereafter, come home late in the night -only then the city will be safe. -Get lost. Do you have a formal dress? -I don't, why? -Fine, let's buy one. We have an important thing to do. I doesn't look crowded though. They all don't look like a competition to me.

Greetings to one and all. I'm going to speak in Tamizh. The real Tamizh Stand-up Comedy, boss. That's my friend Dev he said let's go to a coffee shop. You mean the coffee shop, where foreign language songs are played menu will be confusing moreover we end up buying a coffee worth of 30 rupees for 300. and have it for long until it gets cold. He agreed with me though. Fine, I came to terms to have that coffee our brother here was performing Stand-up comedy I've noticed, all the stand-up comedians once they start asks, "Have you gone to USA?" "Have you gone to Africa?" "Have you been on a flight?" If I could afford doing all that, why would I be watching you perform? Good one! Brother, let's take a selfie. Woohoo! -Thank you, brother. -Nice meeting you. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Bye...! 'I'm the ladies man, no one can compete with me' Ey Samosa, seems like you've become a celebrity overnight. How many phone numbers did you get? Excuse me, my days of getting numbers are gone rather I'm in a place, where I give out my number. Arghhh! Don't forget that you're speaking to a star. What are you looking at? Give it to me. Ey---Meghna has sent him a friend request. -Thank you. -What!? Can I have your number...? She's asking for his number, shall I give it to her. -There's no need for it. -Ey--give that back. She has yelled enough, now she wants to do it over the phone too. How do you know, she's asking the number to yell? Give it to me. I know about these women, the keep yelling at you. Hey...she's calling from Facebook. Take it. Hello! Hello!? Hello... Hey...Hi! Can we talk? Ummm...sure we can talk. Why did you cancel the friend request you sent before? Oh you canceled it? I thought you weren't interested. Oh! Let's take it, I'm interested now. Did she just say, she's interested? When you came after me if I had responded to it what do you think, you would've done? That's too sudden for me even you appeared suddenly in my life. Uncertain things are the most interesting ones. The excitement at the sight of you I wanted to know, if you feel the same too. So, I came. Ok... ...and? May be we could've been friends Ey...! -Friend, really? -Umm, are you sure? Friend? So were you expecting just friendship? -Tell her, I love you -Propose, damn it I can't do it, shut up. Ey--shut up guys. -Are you there? -Eh...Ya! So was it just friendship you had in mind? Not really That was not my intention, to just be friends. Ok. But, I don't believe in love at first sight. If you wish, we can meet for coffee let's talk. Later if something develops, we'll think about it. Ok!? Ok. Fine, I'll text you where shall we meet in a while. Bye! Bye. YAYYY! Hi! Nice place. I've been here many times. Still... ...it looks more beautiful than before. And your smile is prettier than that. Agreed, we shouldn't say thanks or sorry to each other. Still, you called Buddy, that's awesome Where did you guys get these fries? Idiot! -You tell me.. -Let him be, it'll definitely work. -Hello! -Hi..! Where are you? I'm on the way. Oh, so you haven't reached yet? -Greetings Madam! You did say at 4pm. I'll be there in 20 minutes. I called you in regards to that. I have an important business meeting. I left the city in the morning. I totally forgot about our meeting. I just realized looking at the reminder. I'm busy for next 3 days-- --so we shall meet, once I'm back in Chennai. ok? Hello! -Hello! -Ya..! Shall we meet once I'm back? -Ok. -Bye! Mom, why are you giving me that looks? I really don't get you. Why are we here for a meeting, which not until tomorrow? It was you, who asked him to come though then you should've met him right? I'm not sure who he is exactly. Me calling him to meet seems like it happened in my dreams. My dear, all this ruse to just have a cup of coffee? I know, it's not required but when you're confused about that one cup of coffee, it's pointless. Anyways, from the looks of it doesn't feel like he's interested. What makes you say that? Mom, I do know about men it's been 5 minutes, since I hung up By now, at least an "Hi" "Looking forward to see you", he should've sent a message. Look, there's nothing out here. Ah...Phew! 'I totally forgot about our meeting.' 'I just realized looking at the reminder.' Come on keep calling him. He's not picking up the phone. Oh no! What is he doing here? Shall I get back in? Why should I be scared? Meghna! -Hey...Hi! -Hi. What are you doing here? Obviously, you just called asked me out for a coffee. Then you just canceled and left for Mumbai. I felt like meeting you. Oh, so you just came all the way for that? Ok... Now that you've met me what now? Now that I've met you, I'm happy. You said will meet after 3 days. I'll wait for 3 days, once you get back to Chennai, we'll meet. Really!? You came down to just say that? So what? Can't I? I just felt like seeing you. You're just crazy. Wait, how do you know that I'm staying right here? Aunty had updated on the Facebook-- -Mommy bonding with Meghna in Bombay. You're such a stalker, you know. Ya! I'm on my way, will be there on time. Fine, I really got to go now. I'm late for the meeting -I'll see you, Bye! -Ya... -Dev! -Ya.. My work will go on for two hours later I have another meeting too but I can take that over the phone. Can you wait, until I get back? We could probably do lunch. I've come down 1500 Kms-- --I can very well wait for three hours Ok, I'll see your later. Ya! -Hello! -I'm waiting at the lobby Coming... Dev, what's the plan? It's my plan, come on will let you know. Hop on! -On this? -Yes, come on. Ok! One minute. Thank you! Woah! Have you been to Mumbai before? Quite often, there's no place in Indian, which I haven't been to. Oh! So what's the count of girls, you've impressed with your impromptu visits? Come on, say it. It's the same as how many times you've been impressed by guys and rode on a bike. Ey---what makes you think, I'm impressed with you? The same birdie which said I was trying to impress you. I really can't win you in a conversation. Do you wanna win? Why? Just let me know, if you wanna win, I'll lose After all it's you. You're such a flirt. I'm being serious, not flirting. Whatever! But... I like this. This place? Yeah! It's too crowded. Will we get a table? I'll take care of it. 'There's no table available, please wait.' Damn it, does no one cooks in North India too? Excuse me. Hello...hello, excuse me. Ah...Excuse Me! Are you Mukesh Khanna? Dev! Just wait, It'll take some time. Bhai, girlfriend is waiting... -I'll be there in two hours -not a chance, please wait sir. Ey---please understand the plight of Single guys. Please understand. What are you doing? Fine, you get in, I'll handle it. But you're not letting us in Chotu, clean the Table no.2. 'Come on, he's my friend.' Meghna! Ask them to send the quotations. Meghna! Ya, I'll wait for the mail. Just a minute. Brother, excuse me! Excuse me.. Excuse me, excuse me... Please come. What do you like to have? Two Shaaks Two Paneer Butter Masala Lacha Paratha? Two Lacha Paratha and one Egg Burji Listen-- --and that Mango Lassi Seems like you're really hungry. We're done with starters, are you ready for the main course? Main Course uh? That's right, we never started a conversation -right here? -No, definitely not here. Wow! I never knew such a place existed in Mumbai. You always travel by flight moreover you're on the phone while traveling by car Hey..! I was just kidding though. Why is that, you like me? You just caught me off guard. That's my nature, can't help. Ok. I'll get used to it. Actually, the reason I like you is-- --you look really hot. Damn it, you're just like every other guy. I thought, I could get something better from you. So If I wasn't hot, you wouldn't have come after me right? Woah! Hold on! Hold on! I haven't finished talking yet. Ok, ok tell me. You're really hot any guy will just melt looking at you. I don't know why, that I can't look beyond your eyes. That's when I realized it's not just physical attraction moreover, when I saw you It felt like an adventure to me. I didn't want to miss out on that. That's what I believe made me come after you. This is my first time. I've had dinner with a lot of guys but it's mostly as friends or it's business. But never have I ever, went on a date with someone. -You're lying -I swear! Tell me something about you. What do you want to know? Ask me, I'll tell you. If I keep asking, then it'll turn into an interview. -So...? -I have an idea Let's take it, we're not ourselves I don't understand. There used to be a King-- --and that King was called Dev. Ok, there used to be a Queen-- --and her name was Meghna. -Exactly! That King loved adventures That Queen-- --she loves to make a lot of money. Boring! He loves to spend money. Doesn't he work for a living? It's the Dark Period and the world is going to end why do we have to run behind the money he wanted to make enough and travel the world. Fine, does she only like to keep it formal? No, but why? Being formal, might create distance Fine, then tell me dude Wow! Ok babe! -Ey--! -If Dude then Babe Ya, right! -Fine, let's go -Meghna let's be here for a while No, no, no...I have a lot to do. Moreover you have to get back to Chennai right? come on. Come on! -Meghna! -Ya! Have you done something adventurous in your life? Like what? If I give you an idea, would you be up for it? Tell me, I'll think about it. I'll have to return to Chennai, all alone Can you ride with me? What!? Are you crazy? Come on! Just met for lunch and few words were exchanged how would you know anything about me? If we ride for 1500 Kms approximately 22 hours of journey try traveling with me At the end of the trip-- --at least it'll help you decide whether to keep in touch with me. That's never gonna happen. No ways! Ok, thank you. Meghna, please listen to me once No! Meghna! I need to talk to you. Do you believe in destiny? Why? Twenty days ago, we were strangers but now-- --at least we know each other for a Hi or Bye! I've never went after a girl neither I had any intentions like that First time, I have this unique feeling If I had taken a flight or a private jet instead of a bike never did it occur to me, I could've reached sooner. That's 'cause your thoughts were clouded the entire ride. I don't know why, may be that's why I want to get to know you. I know you're interested too I would love to ride with you. Genuinely, with no expectations. To be honest-- --I don't feel like leaving without you. Will you ride with me? Let's do it. It's safe, I'll reach Chennai in two days. Hello, I need to talk to you. Come with me. Oh no, do I have to convince her too? Aunty, you really don't have to worry I'm a good guy and will take good care of her. It's not that-- --how did you manage to convince her? Congrats! She's very stubborn though but a very nice person. If she ends up liking you, won't let go off you. -All the best! -Thanks aunty, thanks. Meghna! It's awesome right. You and I riding on a bike. Smooth and Fast. Actually this is my first time. What about you? What the hell! Damn it, girl. Hey, what happened? Do you even have a conscience? Why do you ask? I'm riding under scorching heat poor thing, can't you speak with him? Ey! Either ways, when you got here weren't you alone? I don't know about that What if I'm sleepy and ram into a vehicle? Oh no! Sorry.. I'll keep you company -Sure? -Ya! Good! I read the Economic Times this morning they're expecting another recession. This time we'll have to handle it with caution. Enough, stop it.

I said, let's leave. Was I little hasty in proposing to her? She's not talking to me. It's all 'cause of you. I made a mistake picking you among others. Still-- --she is still sticking to you and hasn't left Then you must've impressed her. Haven't you left yet? That route is not safe to travel during the night. I'll leave in the morning. -I'm going to sleep, goodnight -Ok, goodnight. Hi...! Oh shit! Nirmala...Nirmala! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy. Mummy! Mummy! Who are you people? -Nirmala! -Let go! -Mummy! Let go, damn it! -Let go! -It's hurting Let go! Daddy! Sir, please help. -Help, please -it's hurting. Sir! Hello, I'm calling from Nice Road junction there has been an accident over here Can you please send an ambulance immediately. Oh...!!! nothing to fear, don't cry dear. Hey! They're fine, saved by the seat belt. Let's go. Hey---are you crazy? you just started fighting with them Us, in fact if something had happened to you? If it has to be, then it will If everyone ignores, then who will? You did the most stupidest thing. But that was the right thing to do. The kid has got a beautiful smile. I you hadn't stopped to help, that smile would've disappeared. Meghna! -Thanks! -For what? For all the compliments. -Ey! -Come on, let's leave. We still have 300 Kms to cover. Beep. See you, bye! Is that all? Get home before it starts to rain You never said, about what you've decided. About what? Ey--I'm very genuine and have no expectations. I did say... Still I need to know, should I continue or not You're a good person than I expected. But I'm not sure, if I love you I doubt it will happen though. May be we can stay friends. In two weeks, I'll be leaving to America. There's mobile phone, you can text me whenever you feel Ike. I'll reply when I'm free. Bye! Oh, hero! Are you upset? You're leaving me right So I'm really happy. Oh! That means, you won't try convincing me? Love should happen naturally. It should not be forced or imposed. When you have such clarity, what is upsetting you? My mind has got the clarity but the pain lies in a different zone. Idiot! What!? I didn't get that. Idiot! Why wouldn't you call me that. Can't refuse though-- --I've turned into a pet dog. Great, whatta a timing. What is it? Ey--why is that you don't let me long for you? Ey--will you stay the same forever? I will be. I'll need your undivided attention. You won't betray me right? I won't! Tell me the truth! Why do you even like me? Whenever I looked at you, I was scared. Eh...why? Do I look like a witch to you? Don't just nod, speak up. Before I met you I was confident in leading my life alone. But now-- --I fear, I can't. I love you! I love you too. What is that? Mom! Say something. I love you! Fine, say it better You! Better than that-- Us! Are you ok? Oi! Meghna! Hey, move! Please leave. I have no clue, what you're doing to me. Leave! It's better we take it slow. You first leave! Ey--I won't do anything. Let's just talk. No need, just leave. Meghna! Meghna, please trust me. I totally trust you-- --but not me. What if I do something to you? At least let me stay until the rain stops. You do like nature, don't you? Leave. Leave! Should I really? Love you! Ey...! Tell me when you trust yourself. We'll cuddle and talk. Bye, I love you! Get lost! Damn it boy, so much has happened. what happened next? Say, damn it! Get lost, I'm shy. -Blushing! -Samosa, what's happening You'll realize when you're in love. Love!? and Us? You never let us out of your sight. She's calling. -Hi Baby! -Hi, baby. What are you doing? Just chilling with friends. Fine, shall we meet. I'm leaving out of town tonight, I'll be gone for a week. One week!? I'll miss you though. I'll miss you too, very much. Can I come along? Will you? Only if you have confidence on me. If not, then leave it. I have full confidence on you. Really? Then I'm coming along. I love you! I love you, too. Love is injurious to friendship. I thought, will get him hitched and get rid of him. But in the end, I didn't have company to even banter. Hello! Ya, ya...I'll be there in an hour Ya...Ya! Dev, we're running late Baby, come.. Hello, what are you saying? I'm not gonna accept this. We have the App Launch tomorrow. What kind of an answer is this?

You're the sole reason for it. No matter what happens, we should stay happy as ever. Promise!? Promise! By chance, if we run into issues, what do we do? Why will we have problems? Every relationship has its sour moments. What if we end up fighting in future? Simple, I won't fight with you. -What if you happen to fight? -Mmmm. Come on! Fight with me. Ey---stop messing around You were saying that when you look at me, it's adventurous. That's why you came after me. Yes! so what now? Now that I'm yours adventures has ended. Here on, you won't love me the same. Meghna, what's wrong with you? No tell me, I need to know. Ok! if you have to ask me, why I love you... ...I can give you a thousand reason. But that's not the answer to it. 'Cause love can't be constrained by words. It can only be perceived. No, you're lying. I don't see truth in your eyes. No one can love someone so much. Moreover guys who speak romantically can't be trusted. I'm a fool, who is falling into this trap. What if you abandon me, just like my Dad. Do you even realize what you're saying? Ya! I'm well aware of it Ey--Dev! What happened? -Let me go -Where are you going? Dev! Thanks for hurting me. Please come on, I was just kidding with you. No, you're lying. You still don't trust me. and I'm not sure If I can get you to trust me There's no point. Dev, please! Please listen to me. Dev...please. Baby! Why are you crying! Who the hell is that guy? Seems too lewd. Hello! Mind your own business. This is between me and my boyfriend. Did you say boyfriend? And that guy? Damn, you have a very bad taste. You look really hot. Let him go, you can find someone better. Hello, mind your own business, ok. Ok! Ey! -Stop there -Hey! How dare you leave me. Bloody wearing glasses in the dark -Bloody, bear it -It's hurting I'm the only one for you in this life. Is that so? Yes! Be careful, I came back this time-- --I won't do the same again. Why? are you so egoistic? Doesn't matter, if you don't I'll come for you. I've never trusted a man before. Wish to continue the same. Except for you. Don't leave me! Will you hold on to this for me? Whenever you have doubts about me ask my Mom She'll tell you. How much I love you. "Love" is a crazy feeling. Since we got our sixth sense-- --we think a tad bit much than required. 'It gets bitter, if you just stay happy without any issue' if you force an issue, it'll grab you strong.' Can it be more creative? Oh God, that's a great design. Only you have doubts about it. Dev! come here for a bit. This is the design of our upcoming store. I really like this design. But none of them seem to like this design. Why don't you tell me how is it? -Do you have other options? -Yes sir, this one. -Can we try another option? -Sure we can, sir. Give me a pencil. -What's the measurement of our site? - 1/2 Acre, Sir. Frontage will be 120/180. -What about FSI? -FSI will be around 2. Wow, that looks great. Dad, this is just an idea. If we reduce the footprint and construct it elevated-- --we'll get more parking space. Our site is at a 4 road junction. It'll be already cluttered. Such an architecture will become an landmark itself. It'll attract youngsters too. -Do as he says. -Ok, Sir. Son, is it possible for you to take care of this construction? Ok, Dad. Thank you! -You guys carry on -Sure. 'Just as I wished -Ritu, keep this design as reference. --your Dad agreed too -we need to get a approval by tomorrow afternoon. -You can't evade now Dad! I need to talk to you. Please come in, son. Dad, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Meghna. She's a very good girl. Raised by a single mom, lives in USA. She runs her own company. I like her to be part of our family. I'm very happy, son. If you mom was alive, she would've celebrated it. Cute! What's your next plan? I would love to take care of our business. Still, I'll be here--- ---and she'll be over there. No idea how it's gonna work out. I feel it might be tough for her, If I'm not with her. She's a very good girl. She went through a lot during her childhood. Whenever she's with me, she feels happy. I don't want to disappoint her. You speak just like your mother. Don't fear in doing something, which you love. Doesn't matter what it is. It's not imperative you have to take care of family business. So what if you guys can't be with me I'll be with you guys. Thank you, Dad. Dad! I'll take care of the construction of our upcoming store. Thank you. That's fine-- --when do I get to meet the girl? She's quite busy at the moment. I'll invite her to our Bhoomi Poojai. -Good, get her. -Bye! Hi baby! -Hi baby! -Where are you? Jogging! Oh great! Our flight is at 06:45 It's 2 now, get ready. I'll come and pick you up. Baby, boys are bound to pick up girls. -So...I'll come -Ok. Hello! Good Afternoon Sir, this is Murthy architect. Tell me, Murthy. Would you be able to come down at 6pm at the site? only 4 days are left for Bhoomi Poojai. if you approve the design, it'll be great. I have a flight to catch at 6:45. Can we meet at 3:30? Sir, we discussed a design, but you've done the opposite. This is not the plan I designed. Sorry Sir, that's why we came for a clarification. If you sit with us for few hours, we can do it. I have a flight in an hour. Baby have you left? I'm stuck in a situation, there's a small issue. -Hey are you ok? -Ya, ya I'm ok. Baby, you please carry on. I don't think I can join you. -Is it ok? -Ok! -Sorry uh, bye. -Bye! I'll call you back, bye. -All is well? -Mmm...Ya! He's trying to prank me, that he can't make it. But he'll surprise me being at the airport. Hi baby! Baby where are you? Didn't I mention, that I was stuck with work. Oh! Ok travel safe, take care. Bye. 'What exactly is he busy with?' 'No calls neither a text--- --what's wrong with him today.' 'In 2015 businesses with less than, $5 Million annual revenue' 'experienced an average growth of 7.8% in sales.' 'Past performance, does not imply guaranteed future returns' 'but there's certainly a market for the offerings of small businesses.' 'Micro-businesses I mean, those are employ...' -Hello! -Hi baby! What happened to you? Where are you? Mmmm, I'm preparing a surprise for you. I don't want any surprises, I just want you. If all the girls remain like you, boys won't have any issues. Fine baby, I'll finish my work and call you back. - Ok bye. -Hey wait.. Have you told her yet? I haven't yet. 'You haven't told her that the mall carries her name.' 'Let her get back and see for herself.' 'what's so important work does he than me?' 'Is he working during the night too?' -Hello.. -Hey, Hi! Baby, I'll call you back later. Bye. Hey, what's all this? Ey--what's wrong with you? Why are you making me miss you like this? It's all a ruse to give you a surprise. What's the surprise? -Come on -Hey, where are we going? -Welcome. -Tell me, Dev -I'll tell you, wait. -Ok fine, tell me where we're going -Don't rush, we're going there. Ok, fine. Ta-Da! -Welcome, Sir. -Hi! How's it? Meghna Mall. Do you know, who designed it? Who did? Keep guessing. You gotta meet someone, I'll be back. I'll be back. You should eat everything without wasting it Dad, Meghna is here. Is that so, hey come over here. That's a good design. Ma'am, all this is done by him. There's no chance, someone can do so much in just 5 days. He didn’t think about anything else but was focused on work At this rate, the business he's going to take over no one can compete with him. He has spoken about you. You're very lucky. Big family, and he's a good man. -Where is she? -She was right here Sorry sir, I got late Welcome! Brother, it's getting late for Poojai, let's go. -Let's go... -You carry on Dad, I'll get her -Please, welcome. -I'll come, aunty... Hello! Meghna, where are you? I left. Why, what happened? Was this building your surprise? Yes! Is this why you didn't speak to me for 36 hours? Without speaking... Which 36 hours? The four days, where you didn't think about me. The time you avoided me. I never avoided you. In 4 days, at least over the phone had you spent 2 hours with me? Is that a surprise too? What were up to the rest of the time? I was taking care of the construction over here. Oh! What's with the sudden interest in construction? First time, Dad asked me something. How can I refuse. Fine, how long will you be busy with construction? May be until it's over, take it 6 months. Then, what about me? My time with you? Meghna, I'm not going to do business my entire life. Dev, don't teach me about business. I very well know, what will happen once you begin. That's the reason, I was scared all this while. That's why, I kept asking you again and again. The reason I like you was-- --that you'll around always and will spend time with me. Baby, let everything go. Hereafter, I won't do any such thing-- --and will be only around you. Promise me that. I'll take care of you. What do you mean by that? I don't get it It's enough, if you're with me. What you did in these past 28 years-- --I want you to do the same with me for next 50 years No matter what happens, you never took anything seriously and enjoyed your life. Baby, you're very unique. That's why I chose you. You chose me? Am I a product to you? You've been talking just about you all this while doesn't it sound selfish to you? Oh, is this called being selfish? Then if a girl is good looking, being with her is an adventure if I get married, she'll be good homemaker. Will cook for me and have my babies. Don't you guys expect this from a girl? What do you call that? I am selfish! I chose something which will make me happy in life there's no harm being selfish about it. Meghna, not all men are the same. If you wish to be, then be selfish. But love is something, which not only concerns you-- --but it concerns me as well. If you're around it's enough and your happiness is what matters. You said this. Now you're being a different person. In the name of adventure, you do something interesting on and off. So...the same thing is done by many though. You haven't done squat to be proud of. What are you trying to get at? That I am a nobody. You're asking me to be in your control and listen to you. If so, then all this while you never loved me. Yes, I didn't love you. I trusted you-- --there's no use in talking anymore. Good Bye. Meghna, why are you fighting like this? Hello! Hello! Meghna! Ey--what happened? Why are you so angry? Why are you crying? I won't cry anymore. I've booked tickets, we're returning right away. Hey, hey Meghna. What happened? Meghna, what is this? Tell me what happened? I'm out of this relationship. -This won't work out. -Why? -It won't work out. -Tell me why, damn it He can't give me the time I require It's enough we got betrayed in the name of Dad. I don't want to get betrayed once again. Don't act in haste, Meghna. Let's sit down and talk. He's a very good guy. I don't need anyone, anymore. Meghna, please listen to me. Are you coming with me or not? Meghna! Meghna! Meghna! Meghna! Meghna! Meghna, I'm sorry. Whatever it is we can sort it out, please stop the car. -Please! -Just hear him out Mr.Ramalingam! How's my son? there are 4 fractures, it's critical though. I think he needs someone with him now. You guys wait here. Sorry, Dad. I'm hurting you guys a lot. I did all this, so that she doesn't have to worry. The name of our daughter-- --also the name of our son, we had decided it. Without her-- --she knows very well, that I can't live. Still she was ignorant and left. Along with it, she took my life too. Before she disappeared from my sight--- ---I felt like killing myself. Dev...! Dev. I understand your pain very well. I was in the same state as yours, when your mother died. That time, you guys were there for me. Now, I'm there for you. I'm not sure, what she did was right or wrong? But I'm sure, I raised you well. No matter what is your decision, I'll support you on that. But I can't bear another loss. This smile is your identity. This is where I see your mother. Please don't lose this at any cost. Mom! Mom, please open the door. Why are you so angry with me? As it is he hurt me-- --why are you hurting me more? I thought you'll change if a man enters your life but when I saw you not respecting any relationship there's no point in talking. Were you asleep? No! Brother, what is your name? Dev! Fine, tell me how did you get hurt? You've been hurt really bad. I fell, when I was trying to climb a mountain. Oh so you can climb a mountain? -Super! -Mmmm. What is your name? I'm Meenakshi, and she's Dora. My mother's name is Meenakshi too. -Oh is it? -Mmmm. Dora and I are not liking it in this hospital. So we're planning to climb a mountain and hide there. But she's very scared of fox. Is it possible for you to take us along? Promise!? Promise. What the hell is going on? Why is the team being so incompetent? Just 'cause I'm not here, why there is no progress? -Ma'am -What!? They've selected you as the "Best Asian business leader", this year. The award ceremony is happening in Singapore. Congratulations!

Vignesh, I just saw the new, what happened to Dev? Ey--hang up, damn it. Please, Vignesh, I wish to live with him. There's no use in realizing now-- --they're saying he died trying to climb Mt.Everest in an avalanche. Ey, why women are so confused? You don't trust the genuine guys who loves you-- --but you end up with the wrong ones and suffer. Only then you women will get some sense. 'Dev!' 'Wake up Dev, let's play' 'I've never trusted a man before.' 'Please don't leave me..' 'Please...!' 'Dev will you take me and Dora over the mountain?' 'Will you the stay the same forever?'

Officer--- ---ensure that he's attended to immediately. -Ok Sir! -With all the necessary first aid. Are you a fool? What if something had happened to you? It's all 'cause of her. You don't need her anymore. I'm here for you now. No... ...I don't need you. I only need her. Ey--she's an arrogant woman. But, I'm not like her. I'm really sweet. I can't live without her. She feels the same too. Then why did she leave you? We let go-- --so that we can return. You never change, do you? I won't! I love you! I love you too.
