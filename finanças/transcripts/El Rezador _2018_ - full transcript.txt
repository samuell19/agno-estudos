The weather in Quito isn't helping worshipers who are now gathering in the center of the city for the traditional procession of Good Friday "Jesus del Gran Poder". However, a little rain will not stop the faith of Quito nor our live broadcast. We remind you that the church does not promote self-flagellation in any way but does not condemn the acts of faith, which are spontaneously shown by the parishioners converted into the traditional "Cucuruchos". It will begin at "Plaza Grande" at 10 am... THE PREACHER "Three months before" "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" Jesus answered, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life." No one comes to the Father except through me." The Word of the Lord. Praise the Lord. You may sit. The offerings. Let's finish this, please. It's time to let Don Ernesto rest in peace. Thanks. Good morning, Father. How are you? My relatives and I were wondering... who called you? I came on my own, I knew your father briefly. What is your name, Father? Antanacio, Antanacio di Felice. Father Antanacio, thank you for coming. Please give me a second. It's not necessary. Please accept it. Thank you very much. - No, we thank you. - Be well. Have a good day. Stop calling me Antanacio, leave me alone and you can shove your magic pills and shitty businesses up your ass! "As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, hallelujah." "He is alpha..." "The Buddhists, the Muslims, who don't have ..." "That's what God wants" Good afternoon. My "bro". You're always late, Preacher! I have a name. And I'm just five minutes late, relax. How is "The Aunt"? How do you want her to be? She's pissed, she's angry, "bro". You know perfectly well things are worse than ever. There is a new healer on every corner, and a new temple everywhere. It's difficult, that's why I had to close the consulting room. So you are not paying today either? I can't. You are praying in funerals again, aren't you? - Sometimes, only when I have to. - When I have to. Look bro, you know my aunt likes you because you helped her with the pills for her pain. Thank you. She took care of the cops, the D.A. and yesterday she even asked me to pardon you one month, in account for her last appointment. But you're going too far, man. So her back is better? It is better. But that's not the point. The thing is that if you don't pay... and you keep pretending nothing's happening... you become a bad example. The other businesses will get used to not paying... and they'll have no respect. And stop playing dumb... the patients knew, That's why they stopped going. What did they know? I had nothing to do with that boy's death. I never told that kid's parents to stop the medical treatment. Half of that story was made up by that journalist. Then you have to diversify markets. They told me interesting things are going on in the Atucucho neighborhood. Way up north? Yeah, going up the mountain. They say there lives a girl that sees things... the Virgin I think. They say she is doing good miracles. Another one. Keep the change. Where are you going? Where are you going! Pay your debt Antanacio, pay up and disappear. What? Cheers. Next! Could you give me some water, please? Thank you. Do you want more? Thank you very much. How long do you think it will take to get in? I don't know. Some take more, others take less. How much do I owe you? Nothing. Just leave the glass there when you are done. Here you go, my love Hello, how are you? What can we do for you? Isn't she going to tell me? She's not a mind reader. It hurts in the back, up here, in the back of my head. He's number seven. So, what is the procedure? Pray with faith, and touch her softly... it works better that way. I do not care anymore. Don't cheat. The number is first... Yes I like songs and funny gifts... Thank you. It's one dollar. Just put it there. We are going to eat now. We will be right back. - Let's come back later, grandma. - What? They are going to eat, let's come back later. You are just as I pictured you. Can you give me candy? What? Can you give me candy? Thank you! I heard her! I heard her voice! I heard her! Just as I hear you. - I heard her without this aid. - Stop! One moment, please Hey! Another one, please. Hello, neighbor. Neighbor. What can I do for you? - How are you? - Good Bread, please. - Sure, which one? - Those round ones are good. The long ones. Give me four. I just wanted to help you buy bread. Thank you. In fact, I wanted to ask you a favor. Do you think I can speak to you and your husband? My name is Antanacio di Felice. Excuse me. Look, I wanted to talk to you, because... I see what is happening with the girl, and I have a proposal... If it has to do with the girl... we have to wait for Nela to come down. Of course, this is about the whole family. But time is running out, and I will be very straightforward. I believe... what is happening here has a big potential. And you need to make decisions now. We need to make decisions... We? Yes, I'm talking about obtaining more profit. Who the fuck are you? Please leave, sir. Listen to me. I'm not just talking about the material profit. Tell your friends that we understand very clearly. I'm by myself. Alone. Look. Let me explain... Sir, get out, please! It's the other key. That one opens the door inside. Can I offer you some coffee, or something else? - I want one, thanks. - No, shit! I can make it, it's no big deal. No, no, Antanacio, no! Stay calm, please! - How far are taking this "Chucho"? - As far as it clearly shows in you. It's been too long, brother. It needs to be seen clear. - I'll change my clothes... - No, Antanacio, stay there. This is not easy for me. I know. I'm leaving for a second. Be careful. Very careful. Should we go over here, so we don't stain the living room? As you wish. Relax, it's over now. I will tell them to leave more sandwiches in the fridge. Yes? Please, leave the apartment in two days. Don't let the swelling get better. Why don't you take one of those? You say it cures everything. It can't hurt me. Give him one of these. Leave everything as it was. My shoulder hurts a bit. Take the bottle. - It's yours. - Thanks. It works better on an empty stomach. These are the keys. You can go in. Thank you. Miss, excuse me. Do you know what time it is? - It's 3:30. - Thank you. Can I talk to you for a bit? It's about a personal issue? It's important. No, I don't have time. It's about your grandmother and the miracle in Atucucho. Grandma. This man wants to talk to you. He says he knows Gema's parents. Good afternoon ma'am. - Good afternoon. - Thank you for having me. Sit down, please. Thank you. Yes I like songs and funny gifts. But sometimes they scare me. They get very close Gema! Gema! It's me. Number seven. Remember me? What's going on? The lady! - Gema! - Look, there is your mom. - Motherfucker! - Carlos! - The girl, the girl... - She came out by herself! Pass it! pass it! That's it! Go!, Go! Go... Good. Yes! yes! yes! Penalty! That's a penalty! It was a penalty, right? You saw it. You want to play? How are you? Why are you watching us? If you don't want it, I won't get near you. If my husband doesn't want it either? Worse then. You stand in front of our house all night? You know I live there. I was on the balcony, what was I going to do? Leave the girl alone? Thank you. I didn't express myself well the other night. Let's meet again. Because you are "preppy" you can come and tell us what to do? I only have a proposal to make. I have something to offer. If what I propose does not work, I'll just simply disappear. That's it. It's my line of business, I have experience in this. I know what I'm talking about. What do you know? I know Gema has a gift. I know she is special. We feel blessed. And that blessing must be shared with the community. Don't you think so, Carlos? Are you some sort of priest? No! God forbids priests or pastors should come and try to order this. This is exclusively a family issue... and it must be kept this way. It's just a matter of time until someone tries to take advantage of the situation. I know how to properly balance faith and its benefits. It's my job. We are not scammers. Who says you are, Carlos? For God's sake. Don't say that out loud, man. It's not about that. So, stop talking crap... and tell us already what the fuck you want. The first thing... is you have to stop charging for that tithe every time someone goes into Gema's room. What the fuck is this asshole saying? We left our jobs to take care of her. My daughter can eat because of those coins. That's what I'm talking about... to stop talking only about coins. Gema deserves much more... and so do you. She helps people, they need her. All prophets are financed by its followers. She doesn't have to be the exception. Listen, let me explain how this should work. This is the issue... Go. One moment... I have a gift. Look. For the Saint. - It's cute! - Yes... look. Do you like it? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Go on. How long have you been with Nela? We have been together the same age as Gema. - Do you smoke? - No. I don't smoke. They say lefties are smarter. They also say they are demons. They are! Aren't you? Left-handed? No. I'm not left-handed. And you don't smoke. No, I don't. I'll give my life for them. I know. We will do great things together. How do we begin? Left. This street, or the other? Here? Thank you for joining us comrades. Mr. Antanacio di Felice, as a member of our community, has a very important proposal to make. Let's listen to him. Thank you, Carlos. I believe it's important to start from the beginning. And that is... What am I doing here? I've also had doubts. More than once I've thought about picking up my things, and going back to that part of town, where they don't even know we exist. But I couldn't escape from my destiny. I stayed here for a strong belief. For a loving belief. For a star, a star we have here in our mountain... a star which led me to my path. A path we will travel together a path of kindness, love, and healing. A path that will show us... the importance of the power of unity. And above all... it's a path of prosperity. That's why I'm still here. The Lord is talking to us, and he's calling out the name of that star. That star is one of your own, she belongs to this mountain and her name is Gema. Saint Gema of Atucucho. Very well. Very well. It's almost ready. We must be prepared in every aspect. I thought we already were. I spoke with the old woman. Which old woman? The one with the miracle... the one that couldn't hear anything. I thought you trusted us. I do. Completely. What did she say? She told me she couldn't hear before... and now she can, perfectly. You lack faith. I have too much faith. Especially now that she's going to help us. Did she send anything for Gema? No! She will give us something more valuable than money... or gifts for Gema. She's going to tell her story. Sorry, I've been busy all day. How can I help you? How are you going to help me? The same way you did last time? I just told what happened, that's my job. My treatments are complementary to traditional medicine. The parents knew, I never lied to them Did you mention that on your TV report? I didn't say anything Antanacio, the parents did. I don't accuse without facts. Plus, your name didn't appear anywhere. You know, after that failure... I knew the way to illumination. I actually have a lot to thank you. More sugar pills? No, it's a girl. Her name is Gema. She's eight years old. She's a healer. It's real. You know that it's illegal to air images of children on TV, right? We can't without the parents' authorization. Look, I know what you want. And I know what the people want. They don't have to see her. They just need to feel her. And when they do... they are going to adore her. When I touched her I felt warmth in my entire body... and... then I heard her. I heard her... As clear as I can hear you now. Rosa is one of hundreds of believers, a number that is rising... They are watching us all over the country. Everywhere! The testimonies gathered in this popular neighborhood in the north of the ecuadorian capital are already reaching other sectors Several people come here, from different parts of the country, To meet the alleged Saint. More and more people become devoted believers of the healing powers... If you lend her to me for a moment, we can cure her arm. Here you go. We want to see the girl, so she can make us a miracle. Don't worry, there will be space and time for everyone Please, form a line, who was here first? How much does it cost? It's free ma'am, this is an act of faith. That's good! Thank you Prepare the girl. Please pay attention. We will enter in an orderly manner. Pictures are forbidden, so I need you to leave your cell phones and cameras in this basket. Thank you. My blessed girl, please help me. More will come. How much did we make? Two chickens and one potato sack. Fuck. Saint Gema's water! Water, water! We have the water! Buy Saint Gema's water Saint Gema's water Hey. How are you? Hello "bro" Everything going well? It's well. - Do we have more bottles? - Yes. - Look! That's the water. - Wait a second, bro. - Yes, blessed water. By Gema? - By the girl. And if you want I can give you my own blessing. How many? Two. Ten dollars, please. Thank you, have a good afternoon. See you soon. Hey, we can't ever run out of supplies. You understand? We have all the products. Everything being sold in this neighborhood is from our own stock. The buses and the cars? I have everything under control. They can only reach up here with my authorization, and daily commissions. - Ok my brother. See you. - Everything's good. See you. Water! Water! We have Saint Gema's water. This is it. These are all the commissions. How much is it? We are going to be fucking millionaires, Carlos! Where do we keep the money? It's complicated. Now we'll keep it here until we find a bank that will take it. Forget the bank! The community protects us here. Just for a while. We have water! We have rosaries! We have pills to cure insomnia! We have water! We have rosaries! We have sodas! Hello, please give me a rosary and a soda. A combo for you, my neighbor. A soda and your rosary. Four dollars. Thank you. That's it. Right here is fine. It's me. "Hey!" - Gema! - Mommy! What is that? You behaved today? What is that? I don't know, someone sent it. Let's see. It's not heavy. It's not heavy? It's this way. It's beautiful. Yes. Do you like it? I do. Keep it. Gema. We have to work now. Gema! She's having breakfast. She'll be outside in no time. We're waiting. We hope she comes soon. Of course. Please! Right away. - Are you ready? - No. I don't want to. We'll finish early today. Do you want that? No! She doesn't want to work today, Carlos. She's tired! She can't do this anymore. Honey! We can't keep all that people waiting. - Let's leave on Monday. - No! We are not going to work, not anymore. I said, we will leave on Monday. I said no! Just one minute, we'll go in right away. What is wrong? Carlos? What is wrong? She's tired. She can't. There will be no healing today. No! no! You have to be patient... Wait for me here. She is a Saint, but she is also a little girl. How long is this going to last? Ten months, one year at most. We lose a lot of money if we don't work. Three days Antanacio. Three days without receiving people. Your daughter is a very special girl, Carlos. She needs great care. The worst thing that could happen would be that she can't continue healing. Do you understand me? This should be the last time. Do you hear me? This is the last time you make a decision without asking me. Do you think that I thought of this overnight? That this came out of nowhere? She's my daughter. Yes, but this is my business. It is our business. Believe in me. Do you believe in God, Antanacio? What is happening with my family and the community... is a miracle. And we have to make it last longer. Do you know what magicians do to survive? The ones from the circus, or on TV. They call the attention of the audience to their right hand. That is where the show is. But with the left hand, they do whatever they want. That is the hand that does the tricks. You're full of bullshit. In our business, and in their business... people see what they want to see. There are no coincidences. Everything is calculated. Someone knows the stories the public needs... and gives it to them. What are we going to do? Exactly that. We are going to tell them where to look... and with the other hand do whatever we want. And at the hour of our death. Amen. Gema is a feeling, a wish. If no one knows what she looks like, the right hand can still give out... And the girl can rest. Heal me, beautiful girl. Heal me, my back is hurting... Gema should go back to school. She wasn't going to school before this began. Was she expelled? When did you find out she was... like this? That she sees things. All kids see things. Yes. But she can't differentiate what she sees from you, or me. For her, everything is the same. Why can't you believe, even when you see it? People get healed. People want to believe. That's why they heal, Nela. You can't understand everything, Antanacio. You know what I do understand? I can understand there is something special in you, in me... in Gema. In us. Are you uncomfortable with what I'm saying? No. Gema! Relax! Gema is a good girl, she just loses it sometimes. - I spoke with the bank. - Really? They are not ready yet to take us as clients. It's not easy to receive that much money without justifying it. What they can do is change the coins and the small bills... into larger ones. That will solve our issue of lack of space. They will charge a fee. But we are getting to know each other. You are good at this, bastard! Hey, when we change the bills, I'm going to need a part of that money. It's yours! And we can start taking out some small gifts, too. - Cheers! - Cheers. Are you OK? There's something wrong with my arm. And my hand. What did she say? She says I'm going to die. That I'm going to die soon. She's playing with you. - To the right! - You drive, then! If I knew how, I would drive. Fuck! Is Gema doing better? Yes. She is more calm. Do you really trust Antanacio? Yes. Don't let him get too close to you. Don't get me wrong. I don't distrust you. Well, that's what you're saying. I'm just saying we don't know Antanacio well. What you're saying is that I'm a whore. I'm just saying... we should be more careful. If I look at the heavens, and I feel your weep is that your grace reached my heart... Our mother, who is with us, from your mantle, covers our Lord... Hey, man! Let's get a drink! It's cold. Bro, you can't disappear and pretend like nothing happened! I told you to pay up and disappear, not just disappear. Bro, I'm not hiding! Your people are watching me everywhere. Brother, you are alive because I save your skin. You can't disappear without paying. You can't always stop the consequences. You know what bro? I know you understand perfectly well what I'm doing. Here's your money. Capital. Interests. And a lot more for waiting. You are a mother fucker! How do you like that? You will be struck by lightning for doubting me, you know that? In fact, there are other businesses I want to talk to you and your aunt about. Cool! I always trusted you! But we have to see if my aunt doesn't resent you. Hey! Next time ask for permission, asshole. What do you think? What do I think of what? It's a shit-hole. It's more than just an old house. A temple! Let's go, we have a meeting in 20 minutes with the owner. What up, bro? - Brother! - Chucho! Whats up? But I came to the little girl... and the girl healed me. I've been unemployed for over three years... It's a miracle! Good morning. Who is him? He is the girl's father. The Preacher's partner. I'm sorry Aunt... but it was my only option to pay you back. I really did it for you. I know, son. Look... I brought you... the pills that make you feel better. You are a son of a bitch, Preacher! Thank you. Your new business is pretty far away. Yes. That is why I came to see you. We have a project... You know, Preacher? I understand your risks. And I know that because of them, you receive blessings. I have been this way. I have also made difficult decisions. I know. And he has been one of my decisions... This is Carlos. Gema's father. He is my partner. Everything that is happening here began in his hands. Nothing is written in stone. We pave our path, step by step. Yes. Precisely because of that... we have come here... Only God knows! Okay son what do you want to talk about? I thought you didn't know how to drink. You open your mouth and you swallow. That's it! Look. The only asshole here is you! No, no, no, no, no! I didn't trust you because you have that face... and that color of your skin. I've been more screwed up than you. You don't know me. You have no fucking idea of who I am. I understand you, from your soul. I don't have doubts anymore. Look at what we have accomplished! Our own temple. You know, that is also a delicate road... that we have to follow very carefully. I welcome the sacrifice, that we can offer. Cheers! - Cheers! - For you, and your family. Ask for another. Ask for it. I'll pay. Gentleman. One more. Can we have one more? The last one, sir. - The last one. - Thank you. This asshole is so heavy! Shhh! Gema is going to wake up. I'll just move him a little bit. So, is the girl asleep? Shhh! She's going to wake up. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey! Is there another room here? Is there? Let's go to the office for a bit. Let's go to the office. Do you have liqueur here? No! We still can't talk here? Shhh! Are you sure? We have to be quiet here? - Quiet? - Yes, quiet. - Really? - Yes Hold on. I'm soaking wet. He will begin deteriorating slowly. We found a large tumor in the brain We need to be prepared for that. Hey! I didn't know you were here. And Carlos? He is still taking care of the temple restoration. Since you weren't here. - Of course. - It needs work. How are you? I don't feel any different. You know? Well, you should go home and rest, you probably don't have the brains to deal with this business. I still have half of it. I have half a brain, half a tumor. I'm sorry I don't know what I said. It's fine. And your hand? They say since I have the tumor on my left side, I will gradually lose awareness on my right side. Gema knew. Gema knew what was happening to me. Maybe this is the moment to start believing. I believe. I believe in Gema. In God! We betrayed her, Nela. And now she's showing it to me. Gema. Honey. Antanacio is back... and wants to visit you for a bit. We are in the week before Holy Week... How are you? Gema Gema Forgive us. Do you forgive us? Huh? Do you forgive us, or not? What happened? She's purging me. She forgives us, and heals us. She's purging me, and healing me. Let's leave! Let's leave together. The three of us. Where? Far away. Let's go now. Why would we go with you? We are united. Don't get confused. Go home, rest. Think things over. Search for the family you want, because it's not us. Thank you for coming. Hey. You look great. Thanks. What do you think? Better. It looks elegant, professional. We have all the permits. Better than a cathedral. Everything according to your instructions. You can do whatever you want here, Carlos. And you can take all the time you want. This is mine as much as it is yours. There are some small details I wanted to talk to you about. Yes. We have a bank account now, under my name, for now. We can add your signature whenever you want. That check is going to grow, Antanacio. But I had to make some decisions, because you weren't here. Yes... I know who you've been talking to. Besides the people from the church. I spoke to Chucho. What did they offer you? A candidacy? It goes beyond that. I have a vision for this business, and I need relationships that can push it forward. Why should we only build one temple? This could be the first of many. I spoke with the journalist. She offered me an entire TV program dedicated to Gema. And I will offer a mass, a large mass. What are you talking about? You're crazy. You know what will happen if you show Gema's face? You will put a scar on her forever. I see the future Antanacio, and this could be a good start. A great start! You're an asshole! Loser, son of a bitch. A blessed crucifix... hair of St. Gema, real hair... Let's go. They are waiting for us at the house. Let's go. Why don't you sign the consent form, while I begin with the girl? Sure. Would you like me to ask you some questions? - Yes. - Very well, love. Just stand here. I will be here. Sure, no problem. Ready, recording. Ok. Your name is Gema, right? What games do you like to play? Gema. My love, this lady wants to know you. What is she saying? Is just that Gema likes to play with numbers, she says you're number 20. Really? I love the number 20. It's my favorite number. I have an idea, what if you also tell me a secret? - Yes? - Ok honey, come here. Should I record? No. Let's wait for her to calm down a bit... and we will continue with her later. I see she's very calm. I don't understand. What happened? Don't contradict me. What did she say? That I was going to die. That I was going to die soon. She is playing. She says that to everyone. Yes, I know how kids are. How about if we go inside and film inside the house? Of course. I will have someone walk you over. We'll wait for you at the mass. Thanks. Are you OK? Yes, pick up the things and let's go. Because only the love of God can make miracles happen, the only possible fear is towards him. The Lord has told me many times, preach the truth, do not be afraid. I am with you. Not here! Because the demon disguises daily with his false testimony when it is more convenient. God asks me... Do you really love me? Yes, my Lord! Do you want to be faithful to me? Yes, my Lord! Do you really want to follow me? Yes, my Lord! Here! I give you my cross. This family accepts the suffering of the Lord and gives it to the benefit of everyone. Today... we begin the Holy Week... and we have a gesture of generosity and kindness. Some families, out of goodwill, have given presents to the little girl and she wants to give them back to the community. Come, Gema. Holy gifts! Be calm brothers and sisters. Everyone will participate. Don't stop recording. Son of a bitch! Stay calm! Stay calm! Get her out of here! The mass in honor of the little girl called "St. Gema"... which gathered thousands of followers in the neighborhood of Atucucho... was tarnished by the death of one devotee... suffocated by the crowd. Who controls these events? Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now... and at the hour of our death. Amen. There are people who still believe. You have more faith than them. In you, Nela. I have proved it to you. We have money, Carlos. Let's go away! We don't have as much as you think. I invested a lot in the temple, we have to recover it. What do you mean we don't wave money, Carlos? We have enough for one of two more weeks of work at the temple. After that we will have to open it.. And start working. They are here! Nela! They are here! They came back! They came back! Get the girl ready! I'll prepare some breakfast! You look better. I always knew it. You made it all up... and convinced Carlos. Gema's visions, her healings, all. The deaf old woman told me so She told me you grew up working for her. They are also my family. But that didn't stop them from telling me the whole truth. I only had to pay them some money and that was it. I am poor Antanacio, not stupid. You knew the old woman wasn't deaf, but she was very sick and broke. That's why she helped you fake the miracle, right? She's an old woman, they all get sick. You don't keep in touch with her anymore. The old woman is cured. Gema's power is real. Gema forgives, Nela. Don't waste your life, like I did. This is your opportunity. I am your opportunity, for starting over. From scratch. No more cheating. You don't have much time left. Gema is also healing me. Don't you see it? And I have money. You were stealing from us. What is your name? Your name is not Antanacio. My name is Antonio. Can you buy three tickets? For the eight o'clock bus, to Cojimies. - Today? - Today. And why can't we go together? Because I'm going to Quito, to get the money. Let's go, then. Whenever you have the ticket, we'll meet here, on this corner. Ok. See you at eight. Sure. At eight. If you go to the neighborhood, be careful Calm down, I'm protected. One and... two. Two. I'll go with you to the temple. No. Come, Gema. Hello my love, where are you? - How is Gema? - We are okay. - Look, Carlos. We need to talk. - Sure! Are you with Antanacio? Who do you think I am? I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm coming to the temple, ok? Of course, this is your house. Bring Gema please... tell her I love her. Good bye. "Your own home, your best investment" Gema! I can still get our money back. Daddy! My love! - How are you? - Fine. Hello. Hi. Look. Do you like it? No? She looks like the woman who plays with you. No, daddy. She doesn't look like her. That woman is old and smells bad. There she is. She is laughing at us. It turned out exactly as you wanted it. Gema, Put it down, you're going to break it. I'll wait for you downstairs. Is this our new house? Do you like it? Gema mom and dad have to speak for a second. Wait for me here, ok? Now? We are almost finished with the work. There's nothing wrong, my love. Everything will be fine. Your things are here, Gema's things. I want my share of the money. I told you, there is no money. It's in this house, sell it. Yes, it's here. In these walls... in the restoration. This house is not ours. It belongs to the Aunt. Did you sign something with her? I don't need to sign anything. I am a man of my word. Everything will be fine, my love. You're an asshole, Carlos! You fucked up the work. My love, you need to understand this is an investment. Asshole! For our future. Long term. Do you understand? Our future. I ran away with Antanacio. I slept with him. You won't do this to me! It's over. Gema is taking care of us. Gema is a sick child. I take care of her. She doesn't heal you Antanacio, she doesn't heal anyone. We can't do anything now. Just one last sacrifice for eternal life. The tumor is confusing you, Antanacio, you don't see things the way they are. I sent that virgin. What the fuck are you saying? I sent that virgin to steal from you. But I didn't know it was Gema's plan to save you. The girl asks for my help one last time. I know what they want. They want a scandal, someone to blame. And they will find it. They will find me. I killed him... and you leave. Go get the girl. Go! Gema. We have to go. Where's daddy? He went away, he went away for a while. In you my life... in you my pain, in you my sacrifice. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! There he is! He's the killer! Open the door! Open the door! Take him out! Son of a bitch! Let's go! Our camera is the witness of this particular Good Friday. But this scheme, with scams, abuse and death... was not able to stop The death of the hustler and murderer hours before the start of the procession could not tarnish the acts of faith and love of worshippers. While the authorities are trying to close the case... the videos of the lynching are still being shared on social media. We, as a media outlet... feel it is our obligation to air them due to its undeniable journalistic value. And we ask ourselves... is taking justice on their own hands the solution to the lack of control to these activities? Reporting for you, Elena Figaredo. Thanks Elena. On another topic A new case of government corruption... Your blessing, Aunt. Thank you, son. What's up, brother? What's up Chucho, how are you? All good. How's everything going? Everything's well, the tithe, the handouts. It's perfect. Everyone is collaborating and supporting us. Hello neighbor. Hello neighbor, can you bring me the accounting books? Sure. "Saint Carlos"
