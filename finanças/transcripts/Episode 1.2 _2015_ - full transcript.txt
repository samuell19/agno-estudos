Will the report give final approval for the glacier hotel project or not? What if something was found up there and we had to protect it? Your prognosis is now final stage palliative care. You can go back to the mainland, Henry. Hey. I know you! Your name's Jason. Frank, come here, he's all better. ♪ The river did come to me ♪ ♪ Straight into my arms ♪ ♪ I tried to caress it ♪ ♪ But it ran through my fingertips... ♪ ♪ Water will keep running, rivers will turn ♪ ♪ Water will keep running and rivers will turn ♪ ♪ Water will keep running, rivers will turn ♪ ♪ Water will keep running and rivers will turn. ♪ I chose a life of crime in a town where there's none. I studied criminal law on the mainland, came to Fortitude, and married a policeman. And we live on the one place on earth we're guaranteed a quiet life. Our honeymoon was a night of thrills and magic. Eric took me up onto the glacier in a tent-- or more a bivouac, really. And the temperature fell to minus 30. So that night, we saw the most spectacular Aurora Borealis I'd ever seen. "The fireworks of the gods," as we called it. The heavens singing. You can actually hear them, you know, the Northern Lights, outside the city. And now we are building a hideaway in the ice. We are building a hotel hewn into the glacier itself, where lovers of the wilderness, lovers of the Northern Lights, or just lovers can witness the wildest things they'll ever see from the safest place on earth. I'm quite proud of that line actually, so I don't mind if you want to use it in your brochures. And here it is. Excavation scheduled to begin in two weeks' time, and in six months, we'll be ready for our very first guests. So thank you, and enjoy. Sheriff Anderssen for you. Dan? Hildur. Charlie Stoddart's dead. What? I'm sounding the bear warning. Keep all the delegates in the building! Bear attack?! Search the perimeter of the property-- prints, spoor, or blood trail. If you see the bear, shoot to kill. What about him? Go! You'll stay in the back of the car until the officers return. You think a bear did this? For your own safety. Ripped By mstoll ♪♪ Hey! The bear trail should lead from the back of the house. Don't let the dogs inside. I'm dying of liver cancer! What? I'm dying of liver cancer. Thank you. Get out of here! Before you set off the alarm! In the Research Center, we have equipment which could... could significantly improve Liam's chances of recovery. Equipment? Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment can increase the viability of reversibly damaged cells by preventing hypoxia and reducing edema. Um, okay. If that's what he needs, yes. It's a research center. It isn't set up to treat patients. It's experimental, and there are risks. Well, do you think you could get Liam in? We could make an exception. I'd need a signed consent. Hello? I don't expect you to understand. If a bear came in the house, you'd be the first on its list. Now, I'm going to keep you safe. I have responsibilities like you cannot imagine. It's all right. I love you. Have you searched the grounds for the bear? Yes, of course. You can't hear them coming, you know. Dan? Oh my God. Look at the wound pattern, Margaret. This wasn't done by a bear. Oh... Hildur. Oh my Christ, Dan. Hildur, listen to me. We have a very serious problem here. I don't think this is a bear attack. He's alive. He's still alive! He's arresting. Cardiac massage. Just put as much pressure there as you can, yes? Paddles, paddles, paddles! Charging! Clear! Where's Charlie? What's going on, Dan? You shouldn't be here. There's nothing you can do here, Henry. Go home. Let me take care of this. Go home. Petra? What's happening? Professor Stoddart's been attacked and left for dead. At first, we thought it might have been a bear. What? But now it looks like a murder. So full forensics. Murder forensics, not bear forensics. It's awful in there. Go on, get in. Hey, Mr. Sutter! What now? What's going on? What are you doing out here? Looking. The hell are you looking for? You're driving my dog nuts. Hmm? What were you doing earlier this evening? What? Something wrong? You were doing something you shouldn't. Yeah? Five minutes while I get my gear. Am I speaking to the same detective who was out here? DS Littlejohn, investigated the Pettigrew death? No, no, please listen. Listen, Billy Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear. He was murdered. Now Professor Charlie Stoddart has been murdered as well. The Governor is responsible. Her sheriff killed them both. Hey! Somebody! Hello? Natalie should've been there too! He thinks she was invited to dinner too. I know where she lives and I'm on my way. Find her and bring her in, Ingrid. Swabs, clipping, fingerprints. She's not a suspect, is she? Ingrid, it's important we can rule Natalie out. Okay, I'm on it. ♪♪ Would this be something you could feed to a rabbit? Uh-uh. A human being? You could feed the rabbit to the human being and not bother buying the aubergine. That's not an option. There's a bear in town, Carrie. Where's your dad? He's at work. Sometimes, a bear comes into town and then the police have to carefully usher him out again. There's 3,000 of them and 713 of us, so I tell you, if those bears ever get organized... Excuse me. So, if you'll please gather round. Governor. I've just spoken to Dr. Allerdyce. It was too late to save him. Charlie Stoddart died on the operating table five minutes ago. Governor Odegard, I was hoping that we'd meet your husband before we left tomorrow. Is that going to be a possibility? No, I'm sorry, Eric's indisposed. Nothing too serious, I hope. No, he stood in a bear trap, but he'll be fine. What? The pulse. Yes? It's right here. Yes. When you found him, you felt for a pulse, didn't you? Yes. Here, at his throat. And his wrist. Here. Yes. You looked into the man's eyes, face to face, like this. Yes. Nothing. There was nothing. He was dead when I found him. No pulse, no pupil response. He was dead. You're sure? Yes, I'm sure. Okay, gently. Connected. Mom? Hey, kiddo, I'm here. You're going to be all right. The doctor's looking after everything, okay? Mom, where is this? Where am I? Shh, you stay down. Don't worry. Hold him down. Liam, this isn't going to hurt. It's gonna be all right. Move out of the way, please. Natalie? It's me! It's Ingrid! ♪♪ Dan, Natalie isn't home. Her snowmobile is gone, and it looks like she's packed clothes for a trip. She might have done a runner. Groups of four! Line up and listen to Chief Anderssen. Fast as we can now! Come on, fast as we can! Can we handle this? Or you? Do we have the resources, or should I request assistance from the mainland? I can handle this. You were drinking. Hildur, I was off duty. If the murder team come over from the mainland, they'll be looking at you, Hildur, won't they? Charlie wouldn't give you the glacier. Our missing girl's name is Natalie Yelburton. 29 years old. You all have her picture. Many of you know her. Friends of hers. Before you leave here, you must understand this: Natalie Yelburton could be a victim-- missing, lost, abducted. You have to ask yourself the question: if she is worth the risk to each one of you that this search entails. Myself, my team, we have a job to do. We signed up for this. All of you, look out for one another. Okay, let's go! Come on! Let's go! Move it out! Hello? Anybody? I'm looking for Chief Superintendent Dan Anderssen! I have brought back your fucking rifle! Hello! Dan Anderssen! Motherfucker. I just thought you should know they've got a treatment for frostbite at the research center, and I've brought Liam here. I just thought you should know. Hello? Hello? Hello, is everything okay? Traditionally, they used wee. Old lady's urine. Oh, God, you've got to be kidding me. But nowadays, it's fermented in ammonia. Well, that's progress. You have to wash the fish thoroughly in fresh water before you cook it, or you could burn your esophagus. I bet. So do you cook this, um... Lutefiske. For your husband? Once. He wouldn't eat it. So what do you do? Wait, let me guess. Travel industry? You know, the one thing that I don't understand about Fortitude is how the people there endure the dark months. I mean, the isolation, the cold, the desolation, the loneliness. Oh, it's never lonely. No? Well, the people who live there, most of them share an understanding. What about? You look out for the wind chimes. Okey-dokey. Am I going to have a lawyer? You haven't been charged, only arrested, so you're not entitled to a lawyer unless or until you are charged. What if I need legal help? I can give you any legal advice you might require. I thought you said you were the governor. I'm also a trained lawyer, and the chief of police on Fortitude. You two have it all sewn up. Sound? You need to record all of this. I know! Is it recording? I think it's recording. So why can't we hear what they're saying? I don't know, I'm not a fucking computer expert. Is that how you got that head wound there? Okay. So is it recording? I slipped... Now we can't hear what they're saying again. Ingrid, this is crucial evidence. It better be recording. Where's the manual? It is recording. I don't know. I think it might still be recording, we just can't hear it out of these stupid speakers. I hope so. Red light, red light, red light. What did you think you and the Professor were going to talk about? About the work I was doing here and at university, and... Actually, he mentioned something about an environmental report that he had written. He was going to talk to me and Natalie about it. But I don't know apart from that. Thank you. It's not him, is it? No. The boy was kneeling on top of him and there wasn't a speck of Charlie's blood on him anywhere. But until we have somebody else in custody, I'm not letting him walk. It'll create panic, like we've lost control. I wasn't going to let him go. And what about the girl, Natalie? She's not at home. Her snowmobile's missing. Yeah. Gotta find her. Oh! How long? They can't say yet. They have to allow as much tissue to recover as possible before they can make any decisions. About amputation? Yeah. Where were you? Where did you go? Jules, listen. I know what you're thinking. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to say. I don't know what happened. I think what happened is you went out to be with another woman. Is that right? Listen, Jules... Oh, my God, you were. Go. She can have you. Just go. Sheriff. Elena. Where were you last night? What? Did you meet anyone last night? No. Do you know Charlie Stoddart? The man who was killed? Yes. Did you know him? No. I didn't know him at all. Okay. Would you like a drink? Danny. How did London get the news so quickly? Look, I have 100% confidence in the Fortitude Police, but if London are kind enough to offer us this level of assistance and experience, then obviously... Every consideration. Yes, thank you. Up here? Yes. Do you need a hand? No, I'm good, thank you. Great. Chief Superintendent Dan Anderssen, let me introduce Detective Chief Inspector Eugene Morton. Hi, Gene. Dan. Here, I have a... This is a commission rogatory. It's a cross-border memorandum of understanding between Oslo and London that formalizes my role as a representative for the interests of the family of the murder victim. Right. Ever since they opened the research center, there's been this accord. Not with me. DCI Morton is a forensic expert. He can provide invaluable analytical skills-- skills and experience he acquired working with the FBI. We have skills. I'm sure you do. And also with the International Aviation Authorities Air Crash... ...Investigation Unit. Right. We don't have an air crash. I've told DCI Morton that we will extend him every consideration. All right, if you'll excuse me. Yeah. I've never felt cold like this. My ears actually hurt. And I've never seen a polar bear. I've never eaten lutefiske. What? Lutefiske. What about it? I've never eaten it. I've never tried it. But there's always a first time for everything. And you've never conducted a murder investigation. All right, I'll make a deal with you, Chief Superintendent Anderssen. If I'm right. I'll leave in a day or two, but if I'm wrong. I'll be on the next plane back to London, no questions asked, no recriminations. What are you talking about? Outside Professor Stoddart's house. I bet there are wind chimes. You know, in the home counties, they have a similar signal. Pampas grass in the garden means that swingers live there. That's not something we have in Fortitude. What, sexual infidelity? Pampas grass. How did the dog die? I shot it. Do you have another one of those suits I can use? No. Officer? DCI Morton. Hi. Hi, London Met. I'm here to assist with the investigation. Chief Anderssen wanted you to take me down to the station straight away. Really? Yeah. Chief Anderssen said that? Yeah, yeah. He also said that you're the best officer to bring me up to speed. Shall we? Sure. Okay. Just straight down there. You could not have been more helpful, thank you. My pleasure, sir. Hi, I'm meeting Trish Stoddart in... She's in Dan's office. Yes, good, thank you. Oh! So who are you really, then? Let me introduce myself formally, Trish. I'm Detective Inspector Morton of the Metropolitan Police. But you're an American. Yes. So can you tell me what the hell is going on? Well, I hope so. I mean, that's why I'm here, to find out what's going on and to look out for your best interests in the investigation. What investigation? Nobody's told you? Told what? I've been told to wait. Dan needed to speak to me. Okay. Well, um... Your husband Charlie is dead. What? What? Somebody or something assaulted your husband in your home. At any rate, while they were searching the premises, it turns out your husband was still alive, unbeknownst to them. He was left? Yes. For how long? An hour. And as soon as they found out, they called an ambulance, they got him to the hospital, but it was too late. And he died. Dan's here to talk to you about it now. I'm very sorry. I thought you knew. I think we can rule out the grieving widow. Look, I need a room. Um... Please, can you just get me a room? I've messed everything up. I heard something happened to Liam. Is he being flown out? It's much worse than that. Liam is too sick to be moved. Oh. But look, just... please just give me a room. We can talk about this after. There are no rooms. You can use my room. Hi. Starting without me? Who are you? DCI Morton. From London? Mm-hmm. 30 degrees softens up the dried blood just about right, and you don't want to use too much pressure, because you want to make sure not to wash away any secondary contaminants. Are you okay taking notes? So you're here to help? That's right. From London? Mm-hmm. But he was only declared dead 12 hours ago. Mm-hmm. So... So how could you have got here from London to help with the post-mortem if you would have had to leave when he was still alive? "If you would have had to leave" Your English is very good. Okay, it's already apparent that more than one bladed implement was used in the attack. The striations here in the ribs and the sternum suggest a cleaver, these long incisions here are some sort of stabbing implement, and then these triangular punctures that are all over the torso, those suggest a third assailant, and maybe-- maybe-- that this is some kind of ritualistic murder. Ritualistic murder? What kind of ritualistic murder would you say involves a potato peeler? Hmm? Get out of here. I can't do that. Shall I continue with the post-mortem examination, boss? Please, Petra. Actually, let me take you through it from the very beginning. With this degree of entry, cardiac output would be impaired and blood flow to and from the brain severely compromised, and this would mean that the pulse at the victim's throat would be barely perceptible. Pupil dilation response was next to zero, and so he appeared dead. Hildy. What's the matter? What, no one's told you? Told me what? Charlie Stoddart's been murdered. What? I saw him on the floor, and he was... He was all... He was completely split open. Come here. That's terrible. Jesus Christ! I know who did it! Where are your cigarettes? Right there. Where? They're not in your jeans. Try my jacket. Hey, what the hell is this? That's mine. They've got a man in custody, but they're still looking. This Professor's chest was hacked open. Imagine that. Jason. Jason, pick up, Jason. For Christ's sake, Jason, what have you done? You know that Jason isn't capable of doing anything like that. Then I have to speak to him. You shoot to stop, just like you would a bear. I should have been there, but I was with you. Trish, we might have found something incredible. Something that's going to cause a hell of a lot of trouble. Is this what got him killed? He was already inside the house. Dan was already there? Yes. Ripped By mstoll
