[Paul Farmer speaking] Welcome to our world. [cameraman chuckles] [speaking French creole] Good evening, everyone! [all] Good evening, Paul! [in English] So, these patients mostly have multi-drug resistant TB. Notice the ultraviolet lights, that's to kill the bacterium… The bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They're watching Silence of the Lambs. And I just… I just got them Lord of the Rings. [speaking in foreign language] It's a great movie. Lots of action. Hello my dear. How are you? How are you feeling? Compared to before, I feel great. [speaking foreign language] [in English] You know what she just said to me? I said, "How do you feel?" She said, "I feel, compared to how I was, I feel great." [chuckles] She still looks like a skeleton to you, but she looks like a skeleton with five pounds extra to me. [speaking foreign language] I'd lost all hope. [woman speaking indistinctly on video] [in English] She started the 2nd of October on her treatment. [Ophelia Dahl] Wow. How much has happened over all these years. You know, this young woman was at death's door, and she's getting better. It wasn't a magic recipe. It was treatment that's been available for decades and decades. That… That's all it was. So, Cynthia wants us to see a patient. [Dahl] And yet, there were so many more people who should have access to basic medical healthcare. [all speaking indistinctly] [speaking in foreign language] But, it didn't have to be this way. There was a moment in time when it all could've been different. [lively music plays] Colonialism had ended. And emerging nations planned bright futures. And, in an almost forgotten historic event, in a place called Alma-Ata, the governments of the world came together to make a revolutionary promise. Full healthcare would be extended to all, beginning with the poorest on Earth. Health, which is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, is a fundamental human right, whose realization requires the action by all governments. [audience applauding] [announcer on video] Health for all is the future. [Dahl] But, this grand vision never came to be. Instead, larger forces from wealthier countries created plans that crippled the once-rising nations. They ushered in poverty, disease, and chaos. And that is when we first met, in Haiti. [horns honking] [Dahl] I arrived there late at night, in January of 1983. I was 18 and a half. There was a part of me that felt overwhelmed by it. Because I was wrenched into the reality that I quickly realized was much of the world. I was volunteering for a group, an ophthalmic group, called Eye Care. They had outreach clinics. That's when I met Paul. Paul and I clicked immediately, and ended up talking about our lives and our families. I remember that I could see in him this restlessness with the world. [crew member 1] Take this. [crew member 2] I'm just gonna clap in front of your face, sorry. We have… We have medications for that, so… [crew laugh] [Farmer] I remember this like it was yesterday. I was 23 years old who hadn't even started medical school. I already had this deep interest in Haiti, and Haitian culture. It was my first time outside of North America or Europe, in a place I really wanted to go. It was just fascinating. [all speaking indistinctly] Certainly, I was, you know, very young and enthusiastic. But, I didn't know anything. That's where I met Ophelia. And, she was even younger than I. She's still even younger than I. [Dahl] And he was trying to get a job, um, actually at the Schweitzer hospital. Which he didn't get. [laughs] Paul was helping to assist at this clinic in the middle of Mirebalais. [Farmer] I wasn't acting as a physician, by the way. I was just taking vital signs, which I'd been trained to do, and providing some kind of moral support. There would be this enormous line, out in front of the clinic. So, the doctor was about to go out of his mind. He's got no lab. He's got no… Nothing. I mean, you would listen to the complaint, use the stethoscope like a magic wand, or refer to somewhere else. And I started thinking, "We should be referring everyone somewhere else." [all speaking indistinctly] [Farmer] And, this was typical, all over Haiti. And, I was basically learning how not to deliver medical care. I was settled on being a doctor from the time I was probably 12 or 13. My father was a school teacher and one year he got a job in Florida. So, he ended up buying a bus, which was actually a bus used for screening tuberculosis. And, as one does with a bus, we went to a campground. Which was supposed to be temporary. And, then it wasn't temporary. I mean, when I left for college, we were still in the bus. [Dahl] His whole family connected to this very important sense of being aware of other people who were less fortunate. So, when Paul arrived in Haiti, he listened very, very carefully and was eager to learn from those people who were living there. You gotta use the word, "Serendipity," right? When I met Father Fritz Lafontant, he said, "Yeah, you can work with us." [Lafontant speaking in foreign language] Paul was a very young boy when he came to see me in Mirebalais. He could speak Haitian Creole and also French, so we could communicate very easily. But he knew nothing about the Central Plateau. [Dahl] Father Lafontant had been working with people even further out, in a rural area called Cange. And this was a group of people displaced by a big hydro-electric dam project. When the valley was flooded, everything they had was gone. And they were forced up into the hillsides, where they had nothing. [Farmer] When I got there, I got to see what poor planning of a development project meant to poor people. [Dahl] I had never seen such abject misery in my life. [speaking foreign language] [Farmer] What I saw was traumatic. It has certainly taught me to respect the destructive power of poverty. Then I thought, "How can we get this fixed?" [all speaking indistinctly] [Dahl] So, we wanted to do some kind of assessment of what the needs were. [Farmer] I remember Father Fritz said, "Well, you can ask them, but they're just gonna tell you they want a hospital." He was right. "Oh, and proper housing, too. "And, you know what? We want our kids to be in school." [speaking foreign language] My husband has been sick for six months. His name is Daniel. [Farmer] We knew, right then and there, that we had to get a plan and build a clinic. But, we had no money. [speaking foreign language] Paul told me that he applied to Harvard University. [Farmer in English] Fritz handed me my acceptance letter into Harvard Medical School, and punched me in the stomach, like, "Here." He was very excited. He assumed that it was an acceptance, I didn't know. [Lafontant speaking foreign language] He told me he wanted to stay and work here, but I didn't agree. [Farmer in English] He lectured me sternly about it. And he was right, you know? It'd be a lot more effective, having those credentials. When I left for medical school, I dreamed of building the clinic, and a hospital. And we didn't have any resources. I certainly didn't have the experience, or maturity, or wisdom. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea. I met Jim Kim on a snowy night in December 1983. [Kim] Paul was dressed almost like a dandy. He had very fancy clothes, and a nice little scarf, and I was only later to learn that he'd borrowed every bit of it from someone else. We began talking, and I thought, "Wow, this guy is really impressive." Because he could participate in a seminar as if he was one of the professors. [Farmer] Jim and I clicked. We were in the same training program. That's when we really became very close friends. [Kim] Paul and I both agreed that we were going to medical school for reasons of social justice. Now, let me just stop for a second, this is really important. Shall we? [Kim] During medical school, we spent many, many late nights, Paul and I, and Ophelia, talking about fundamental questions. What is the nature of our responsibility in the world? Is there something like an area of moral clarity? There are all these ideas, for example, uh, appropriate technology. Basically, in the end, they're all used to punish poor people. Just like every other ideology is, by and large. So, appropriate technology means, as Fritz, our boss, says, "That means shit for poor people, and good things for rich people." [Dahl] It was during those late-night conversations that I started realizing that these larger forces had an enormous and terrible impact, on the people that we had gotten to know, in Cange. Almost immediately, after Alma-Ata, the world economy had crashed. Many countries suddenly owed huge debts they couldn't pay. Enormous institutions like the World Bank, led by the US, gave new loans to poor countries, to pay their old loans. But there were strict conditions. Unless a nation puts its own financial and economic house in order, no amount of aid will produce progress. [Dahl] At that time, World Bank loans actually required the poor countries to cut investments in education and healthcare, in order to make sure that the loans were paid back. [Farmer] I learned about it in Haiti. Haitians were talking all the time about the American plan. It was ripping the safety net out from under people, as they were already falling. [Dahl] We realized that poor countries weren't poor because of some kind of moral failing, and we felt that we needed to use our own opportunities to do something about it. [Farmer] At that time, Ophelia Dahl and Jim Kim, plus my college chum, Todd McCormack, that's the group that got together. [McCormack] Jim and Paul were debating issues long into the night in ways that I would, be, you know, kinda cooking the chicken, and making the hamburgers, and listening, like, "This is, uh, way above me." And, uh, we knew we needed to get other, bigger funders involved to build the clinic in Cange. -[all speaking indistinctly] -[laughing] [Dahl] And, we were introduced to Tom White, actually through a group here in Boston. -Tom White, you two are kindred spirits. -Yeah. [Dahl] Tom and Lois, his wife, wanted to give all of their money away, while they were still alive. They didn't want to die with money in their bank. And then, Tom White gave us the first transfer of money, to build a clinic. And Partners in Health was formed. [all speaking indistinctly] [speaking foreign language] This is the registration room. This room is for the pediatrician. [Farmer in English] We didn't know what we were doing, we didn't know how to build a clinic. [speaking foreign language] Are you an architect? No, I'm not an architect. I'm a priest, my friend. [laughing] [Farmer in English] We were pretty excited. The Partners in Health team was growing. I met Paul and we spent, like, hours, discussing, you know, social justice, Haiti, and, uh, that's how it started. That was my job interview. [Dahl] As soon as we opened the clinic doors, everyone who was sick came, and it, it was every possible disease you could imagine. [all speaking foreign language] Are you only feeling stiffness? -Yes, and fever. -Fever, okay. [speaking English] People started coming from Mirebalais, from Thomonde, from all over the place. [Maxi Raymonville speaking foreign language] Most of the people that came had to walk 5 to 6 hours just to get to the hospital. And these are people who were very sick. [all speaking indistinctly] [speaking French] Good morning ladies and gentlemen. [greeting in French] Thank you for your patience. [in English] Certainly, I didn't know how to build a proper hospital, right? I mean, to be honest about it. Okay, bonjour… Bonjour. [Dahl] Early on, when Paul was at medical school, he would go to his medical school classes as much as he possibly could. He would often leave on a Thursday afternoon, get down to Haiti, he would start, already, trying to translate what he was learning. And then he'd come back on a Sunday, and then he would start all over again. [Arthur Kleinman] Jim and Paul were constantly going back and forth. In fact, it was a dizzying degree. And they would, uh, let's say, borrow things from some of the hospitals, to improve the situation in Haiti. [Viaud speaking in English] Actually, the first sink we had at the lab was brought by Paul from Boston. On the plane. [chuckles] Carry on. You know, we constantly had troubles funding the organization. Every week, it seemed like there was a new crisis, in terms of funding. See, money, that's the problem. We don't have the money. But, it doesn't mean we can't get the money. We can get the money. [man] Is that being donated from somewhere? Well, I have to say, right now, uh, that this medicine was billed to the hospital I work for, in Boston. And they never charged us. Let me… Let me just say that again, to be more politic. Yes, this is being donated by the Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston. [Farmer] We never thought that there was any heroism in that. We wished that there was funding for us to just get the right equipment and medicines. [Dahl] When Jim arrived in Cange, he was a very keen observer of everything that was going on there. [Kim] My biggest role in Haiti was really helping Paul do his work. I really see that as my apprenticeship. Not only in working with him, but also, in understanding how you take a notion of social justice, and turn it into… Into real work on the ground. I was born in Korea, 1959. And, back then, it was a really, really poor country. So, in 1964, we moved to Muscatine, Iowa, twenty-five thousand people. My father was a dentist, my mother was a theologian and philosopher. And, one day, my father said, "So, Jim, what're you thinking of studying?" And I said, "Well, I think I'm gonna study philosophy and political science." And, he looked back at me, and said, "Look, you're a Chinaman. You think people are gonna pay you to listen to your opinions about politics? You need a skill." I think my father taught me something really important. That if you come into a situation, with something that actually can help another person, it's a good entree to begin a different kind of conversation. [speaking in French] Hello Margaret. Margaret, has she been seen yet? -No. -We'll take you, let's go. [Farmer in English] In those first years in Cange, you didn't have to wait long until you met someone with tuberculosis. -[coughing] -[speaking foreign language] The lung exam has deteriorated. [Farmer in English] She's in a bad way. She actually had been sick for some years. And I don't think it's safe to wait another two weeks. She could die in between now and then. [speaking foreign language] Breathe in. [in English] What happens with this disease if it's unchecked, it destroys the lungs. It destroys other parts of the body, too. So, the patients can't breathe. And they're suffocating, and they're gasping for air. [coughing] [speaking in French] How do you feel? Do you feel feverish? Out of breath. [Farmerin English] In 1988, we had three people all under 50, from the village where we built the clinic, die of tuberculosis. One of them happened to be a friend of mine and she left orphans. This provoked a crisis. Nobody was supposed to die of tuberculosis if you have proper care. [Kim] Paul was just devastated because he kept failing, meaning people would die of things they shouldn't have died from. [Farmer] We'd seen all these vivid things and knew that we didn't really understand them well enough to be, you know, effective. I certainly learned that the hard way. So we said, okay, we're going to bring everybody together and we better figure out what went wrong. [speaking in French] So we had three people die of tuberculosis here. Why did they die? What's wrong with our system? Because we have free medications, free lab work, everything free, and they still died. [in English] The people trained like me, the professionals, blamed the patients for their bad outcomes. I'm dismissive of that. "She's superstitious. She didn't take her medicines." And on the other end of the spectrum, were explanations like, "Patient's too poor. Doesn't have enough food to eat. Too far to get to the clinic," and those moved the responsibility out of the patient and into the circumstances… [speaking foreign language] Look at how they live. The family lives here like this. [in English] We said, "Okay, let's make sure that you're not alone fighting the disease." [indistinct conversation] [Viaude] "Listen to the person. Sometimes, they'd go days without water. If you're too sick, you cannot walk hours to get water to take your meds." [Farmer] It was an indictment of the system that we had built. And that's why we developed the accompaniment system. That's what the Haitians called them, accompagnateurs. [all speaking foreign language] [Heureuse Charles] An accompanateur is someone who is there for you. Someone in your neighborhood to check with you everyday. [speaking foreign language] I go twice a day. Not only to give them medicine, I also encourage them to keep taking them. Otherwise they will keep feeling sick, and they can even die. After this we'll talk a little, I try to encourage her. You know when you are sick, it's easy to become discouraged. [Farmer in English] But when we took the blame off the patients and put it on the system, everybody got better. Oui. [Farmer] This accompaniment system, which was the core of the TB control system in Cange was wildly successful and we reached almost 100% cure rates. If you think about it, it's a remarkably simple model. Allez. [inhales] And it became essential to the work. Is it okay to write "Bravo" in a medical chart? I mean, you've got to love this job. [Kim] After we got the experience with community health workers in Cange we decided that this could be bigger than just the project in Haiti. We decided that this could be something like a movement. [all cheering] [all chanting indistinctly] I went there and I said, "Well, yeah, this is where I should be, because I don't have to worry about being able to give care to people because of the lack of means. We feel such a relief when you could make a big difference in people's lives. [Dr. Joia Mukherjee] When I was a young child, I saw a lot of suffering in Calcutta where my dad was from. So I was always very interested in health problems of poor people from a very young age. And someone said, "You should talk to this guy, Paul Farmer." And I said, "Well, you know, does he have a sense of humor?" They said, "Yeah," I said, "Because if he doesn't, I can't." Like, I… It just is too dark to just go into this with a missionary-like… Sorry, nothing against missionaries. But they said, "No, no, no, you should talk to him." So I told him I'll work for free, and he said, "Well, you have a job then." [laughs] [Dahl] Our team was growing in Haiti. But someone who would change the course of our work entirely was Father Jack. [Father Jack over speakers] This time I'd like to just invite people to stand as we mention countries from which you've come. So as we call… [Dahl] Father Jack was a much-loved priest in a hardscrabble Boston neighborhood called Roxbury. His flock consisted of church ladies, gang members, and Paul who moved into Jack's rectory to save rent during medical school. He was bawdy and irreverent and funny. He was not your average priestly priest. We loved him. Jack's long-held dream was to serve the poor of South America. And one day he decided it was time and he left for Peru. And he encouraged us to grow our work beyond Haiti and come to the outskirts of Lima and see what we could do there. [Farmer] At that time, the World Health Organization, or WHO, which is the United Nations agency that monitors diseases and establishes protocols for their treatment considered Peru to have one of the best tuberculosis programs in the developing world. So when Father Jack invited us, I decided I'm going to start a project, I'm going to figure out how to make an impact. [car horns honking] One of the first people I met was Jaime and we hit it off right away. [Dr. Jaime Bayona speaking Spanish] I was the doctor at the church and in this district Father Jack was trying to help in the best way he could, but he could only do so much. What impressed me of Dr. Kim was his genuine commitment to help. [in English] We began working with a group of young people who we were training to be community health workers. [Mukherjee] Those young people who would visit homes and see what was troubling people. [Kim] We saw so many things that were disturbing. We saw people not able to feed themselves. We saw healthcare services being cut back. And we attributed a lot of those things to the World Bank. [news anchor 1 on TV] Creditors are now insisting that Peru gets its economic house back in order. The austerity program being forced on the country will mean more cuts in government spending, in other words, hard times ahead for everyone. I traveled with Paul and the team to Peru to see what the challenges are. We stayed there and we built accompaniment model. [Farmer] By then, I was specializing in infectious disease and I just knew a lot about tuberculosis because of Haiti. My report from my trip, which I'm hoping is lost, I said, "You know, maybe here we should focus on primary care, women's health…" I said, "But, you know, happily, Peru has a great tuberculosis program," which is another colossal error. [Kim] And then we started finding these tuberculosis patients. It's total light out on the right side. They were patients who were getting treated over and over and over again in this program and they were not getting cured. [Mukherjee] There were a lot of people who were coughing, who had been to the clinic, who had been put on treatment for tuberculosis. They were taking each and every drug that was prescribed to them and they were still sick. And that was surprising. We said, "Well, they must have drug resistance." But then what we heard was, "No drug resistance in Peru. Our program is so good, no drug resistance." [Mukherjee] Tuberculosis is an airborne disease so the stakes have always been higher from a public health perspective because you can't control the air. It's very important that you take medications and stay on them for the duration of the treatment. [Farmer] We started seeing patients who had been treated with first-line therapy not once, not twice, and they still had active tuberculosis. Meaning, they were transmitting it. So there was a big hole in the program. As we were just sort of figuring out that this problem was going on, Father Jack got sick. [Dahl] I thought to myself, "Wow, he just… He looks older, or skinnier, or something." [Farmer] When we saw how sick Jack was getting, we begged him, we pleaded with him to come back to the United States for treatment, but he refused. He said he'd made a very strong commitment to his people, and that's where he belonged. [Dahl] And then Father Jack got very sick and we knew that he had to get back to Boston for medical help immediately. Jim and Paul spent a huge amount of the time in the hospital with him in the room. He got really sick very quickly. He… He died. You know, looking back over the last 30 years, even though sometimes we like to say that we were quick out of the box, it was still way too slow. Because there's always this period where you say, "Please tell me this is not my responsibility." And that delay is lethal. And that's what happened to Jack. He got sick in the delay. [Dahl] And then we found out that he had drug-resistant tuberculosis. This had a huge impact, particularly on Paul and Jim. [Mukherjee] With Father Jack's death being diagnosed as drug-resistant TB, we began to suspect that there were many, many cases in the community. [Kim] Then we thought, "My gosh, how many of these kinds of patients do we have?" [Bayona speaking Spanish] I was able to interview several nurses in different health centers. But the health staff did not trust me enough to share their patients' data. But in one health center, I was able to have a conversation where the nurse showed me the patient data and said, "Someone needs to do something." [nurse] Look at the resistance they have to these medications. And they're not getting better. [Bayona] And there are many like these? [nurse] Oh yes, there are many like these. [Kim in English] Just looking at the number of patients who are not getting better, we thought we might have as many as 50 cases in a town of 100,000. So to have 50 drug-resistant cases per 100,000 essentially is an outbreak. [Mukherjee] What we saw were clusters of drug-resistant tuberculosis where one person would then transmit the drug-resistant strain to others. Those others would still seek care from the TB program and those drugs would not cure what they had and they would further spread drug-resistant tuberculosis. So without the proper treatment, those strains started to dominate in families. The medicines for MDR TB were really expensive. Anywhere from 20 to as high as $35,000. And they were very rare, and so the World Health Organization actually had an official policy on MDR TB. They said it was too expensive and that they didn't think that MDR TB should be treated in poor countries. What the WHO says about treatment protocols is taken as religion in most of the developing world because they don't have the expertise to develop their own treatment protocols. [Dr. Cesar Bonilla speaking Spanish] In records, in countries like Peru, due to the complexity of dealing with these patients, it was better not to worry about these cases. So anyone with drug-resistant tuberculosis, the assumption was that they would just die. [Kim] We went to the local authorities and said, "Look, there's a lot of patients with drug-resistant TB, we should start treating them. We're going to have a huge problem on our hands unless we get going right now." And the head of the TB program said, "If you treat a single patient we will kick you out of the country." They were livid because they thought that pointing out that the program doesn't work for drug-resistant TB would threaten all the gains that they had made. [Bonilla speaking Spanish] It seemed to us that it was not only a difficult task, but that it would be a failure. [Kim in English] It turned out that one of the Peruvian TB doctors had a daughter who was in fact sick with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. But he quietly came to Paul one day and said, "Can you please treat my daughter?" So we in fact did treat his daughter. And his daughter got better. And they let us treat a small group of patients. We had a conversation with the young community health workers and we said, "We're going to start treating these patients. You're going to have to have some exposure to MDR TB. This is a deadly disease." And it's amazing because all 12 of the original health workers said, "Yes, we're going to treat these patients." It was a nightmare. A logistic nightmare, a financial nightmare, everything was conspiring against us. It was so difficult just to find the medicines. We were calling public health services in every state in the United States to see if we could find these vials and we would literally buy them from them. We needed hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat a small number of patients rather than treating a million patients with other problems in Haiti. That was very hard for us to deal with. Were we doing the right thing? And Tom was paying for all of it. It was really Tom White. He didn't want to be the only one funding treatment for drug-resistant TB in the world. But this was life or death. Getting those medicines down there, not interrupting anyone's treatment, was life or death. There was no special help in bringing the medicines in. I would put that medicine in these big suitcases and because I was Asian, they usually thought I was a tourist and they'd let me through a little easier. Nice to see you. [sphygmomanometer pumping] [Kim] We knew that these people were in for a very rocky treatment course if they were going to survive their disease. Both Melquiades and Julia were what the Peruvians called crónicos, patients who'd been receiving treatment over many years and were not getting better. I have to tell you when I saw Melquiades, I thought, "Oh, my goodness." I would not be surprised if he died. We've left him without MDR TB treatment for too long. [in Spanish] We know that it's very difficult to take all the medications, but right now we don't have any others. It's difficult now, but please, please continue. [in English] The stakes were so high and we pushed very, very hard. We knew that we had to have success with these patients or treating MDR in the rest of the world would be written-off forever. [Bonilla speaking Spanish] These patients started the treatment for multidrug-resistance with the hope to be cured, but not with the certainty that it would happen. [Kim in English] Community health workers would go to the homes six days a week for as much as two years at a time. [speaking Spanish] The treatment consisted of more than eleven medications that the patients would take every day. Alright, Melquiades. [Melquiades] I don't want to take these medicines. They don't make we feel well. [Mestanza] These medications have strong side effects but they are the only medications that can help you eliminate the resistant bacteria. [Melquiades] Three years that I've been on treatment, and nothing. Nothing. Three years. It's worse still. [Kim in English] Our patients went through hell in getting treated. [Mestanza in Spanish] For Melquiades, more than the issue of taking his medications, it was the problem of despair, of exhaustion, and that's understandable. [speaking in Spanish] Swallow. [Kim] These community health workers were very, very courageous and special people to be supremely compassionate with these patients who very well could infect them. Both community health workers and patients, they didn't just do this for Carabayllo, they did this for the whole world. [speaking Spanish] Without a war, you cannot win. I want to be a good warrior. If I want to win, I can, God willing. [Kim] If the first patients got cured then we knew that we had an argument. Because the first stage in the argument was even if you wanted to do it, you shouldn't start because it's simply impossible in resource-poor settings. [crew member] We have a clip to play for you. [speaking Spanish] It was a fight. A very difficult one. Wow. [Melquiades speaking Spanish] It's because of the support from the doctors… That's… That's… That's Melquiades? Oh, my goodness. [speaking Spanish] …that you could say I'm here today. [laughs, stifling sobs] [voice breaking] To think, we almost let him die. [sobbing] To think we almost let him die, just because we thought it was inconvenient for us. Just because we didn't think that he deserved it. I've seen others like this, but it's just… This is… What a transformation, my God. I mean, look. A confident, young man, you know. Out to take on the world. [sighs] [Melquiades speaking Spanish] You could say it's expensive, that it takes too much time, costs so much. But I think it's worthwhile because later on, you will see it reflected in all these people. [Mukherjee] The first cohort was 75 patients. They were treated for two years, with five to seven drugs. Eighty-five percent of them were cured, which was a very high rate. [Kim] And so, we thought that we had to do something to change the way people thought about this first question, which was, "Is it possible to treat MDR TB patients in resource-poor settings?" We knew that these numbers were better than anyone was getting in the United States. So, it took us from being outsiders in the global health world, right into the middle of the debate. [Farmer] So, we brought together the big shots of TB, and got them into this one room. It was Howard Hiatt's idea to do it, with the express notion of taking on the policy. [Kim] Once the WHO announced that they would come, all of the good and the great and the TB control came. [Mukherjee] At that time, we were a very small NGO, with a small clinic in Cange, 75 patients in Peru… Jim, who was still moonlighting at the Brigham to pay a salary… I mean, it's just like we were little, bitty… We were small potatoes. [Kim] And, then we presented the results. And the results, really, I think, were shocking to people. [male academic 1 speaking on recording] [Kim speaking on recording] -[female academic speaking on recording] -[all laughing] The vast majority of the TB community literally lost their minds. [male academic 2 speaking on recording] The old school TB crowd was furious. [male academic 2 speaking on recording] You know, even if we believe it, you can't do it. [female academic speaking on recording] I've never seen this debate play itself out among patients, saying, "Uh, I don't really think I'm sustainable." [Kim speaking on recording] The main resistance, always, is cost. These patients… "These" patients. Black people, brown people, poor people, just don't matter. [Kim speaking on recording] That meeting was, "Can it be done in developing countries?" Boom. Done. We proved it can be done in developing countries. And we actually showed how this was done using community health workers. Second step was, "Can you bring the drug prices down?" 'Cause they kept saying, "How can you say that we should treat MDR TB when the drugs are so expensive?" I asked some people from the World Health Organization, "So, do you know if the drugs are on patent or not?" And then they said, "Well, we don't know." And I couldn't believe it. I said, "How can you declare a death sentence on everybody in the poor world with MDR TB, and not even know whether the drugs were patented or not?" Because if they're not patented, we could drop the prices almost immediately. I asked one of our team members, "Just find out if these things are on patent." And he came back and he said, "You know, all of them are off, and they've been off for a long time." And we were just shocked. No one had asked that question before. [Dahl] Jim made it his priority to reduce the prices of these drugs. And the whole thing shifted. Drug prices dropped by 90%. All of that work led to massive shifts in protocols. It was a cascade of events that changed the policy at the WHO. [Mukherjee] I remember Jim said, "If we make this argument correctly, around treatment of drug-resistant TB, HIV is next." [news anchor on TV] The lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic of a rare form of cancer. [Dahl] The world was being ravaged by a new plague. One that would show, in stark relief, what was acceptable, and what was not, for the poorest of the world. [reporter speaking on recording] [press laughing] [reporter speaking on recording] [Dahl] Over 300,000 people died in the US before the powers that be were forced into action. In poor countries, it was even worse. Over 22 million people worldwide were infected. In 1996, a combination of drugs was developed that would keep the disease at bay. It was called anti-retroviral therapy. It was effective, but incredibly costly. Even the most powerful institutions in the world felt outmatched by the magnitude of the need. When you come to look at the question of AIDS throughout Africa, you really get a sense of how limited is the capacity for contribution. [Dahl] But some people were fighting back. [crowd chanting] History will recall Reagan and Bush did nothing at all. [Dahl] We became allies. At that time, we decided to take as many activists as we could to the Amsterdam International AIDS Conference. [all chanting] Shame on profiteers! [Sawyer] And we were meeting all these people from the developing world with AIDS, that were showing up with pneumonia, with thrush, you know, with huge herpes outbreaks on their faces, and no access to medicines. So we were literally digging through our medicine bags, giving people, uh, you know, our Sporanox, to combat the huge outbreaks that were covering half their faces, of herpes. And going to Jonathan Mann, and saying, "Jonathan, there are all these people here. Some of them fucking have pneumonia. You've got to get these people to a hospital or to a doctor, to treat them." And they responded. But that outrage, that other people with AIDS were showing up at an international conference, they were so fucking desperate they were getting on planes with pneumonia, you know, to make their story be heard, just hooked me. -[indistinct chatter] -[horns honking] Governments are killing poor people in developing countries, because they are providing only a tiny amount of AIDS funding, which is limited to prevention efforts, and does not pay for AIDS care. Greed kills! Access for all! At that time, I remember hearing about Paul and Jim who were fighting to treat people in Haiti, where no one had access. [Farmer] We had a lot of patients in Haiti diagnosed in those years. [Lafontant speaking foreign language] Whenever someone had AIDS, we knew it was an automatic death sentence. There was nothing we could do. [in English] We start having people coming back from Port-au-Prince. They come back home to die. [Farmer] A young woman, 28 years old, working as a servant in Port-au-Prince, comes back here, to rural Haiti with weight loss, a cough. And then she gets offered HIV testing, and it's positive. We really couldn't stave off this slow, inevitable, fatal decline, without anti-retroviral therapy. One of the early patients was Adeline Mercon. [Dahl] Adeline was a young woman who went to Port-au-Prince to try to find a job. Her father had mentioned to us that she was home and very sick. And one day, we had gone to see Adeline. She was lying on her bed, and she looked emaciated, and somewhat resigned. Her father was standing with her, and he had already been raising money for her coffin. Paul sat there for a long time. He was able to listen to her lungs and her heart. We got up and started the trek back, and Paul said, "There are medicines for this." [McCormack] Paul started talking to the Haitians, and they said, "You mean there's a cure for this? If I lived an hour and a half away, in Miami…" I mean, it was like, "How could that not be available to us?" I mean… And how do you answer that question? [Dahl] Meds were available. They were just expensive. Adeline was weeks from dying, at this point. And Paul said, "We have to be able to get the meds." [Farmer] So, we made the decision, we have to do this, 'cause running out of time for her. You know, at a time when not a single patient was treated using US dollars in a developing country, we all decided we had to try to do everything we could to scrap together a few medicines. [Mukherjee] Paul was running around getting, you know, sacks of unexpired drugs that were donated, and then we would triage the patients. Because we didn't have enough to treat everyone, we treated the sickest people. [Paul speaking foreign language] Choose people like him, who really need the medications, because there's a lot of demand. He's very advanced, so we have to begin treatment right away. And the accompagnateur is very important. [in English] We just used the tuberculosis program that we developed, with community health workers, and put the AIDS patients in it, with the right drugs. [speaking foreign language] This neighbor is taking Duovir and Nevirapine. [Farmer in English] And we were supplementing the drugs with food, and other kinds of social support, just like the TB program. You know, the accompaniment model. If you want people to survive, do that. They don't have enough to eat! The results were dramatic. And transformative. [Farmer] Adeline gained 26 pounds in one month, and I'd never seen that. [speaking French creole] Open your mouth. No more white spots, nothing showing up on your skin? I'm good, Dr. Paul. I'm just a little weak. Dr. Paul told my dad, "No, throw away the coffin, you won't need it" Thank God, because of them, I'm here. [Farmer] Everybody got better. [François St. Ker speaking French] I couldn't find a hospital that would tell me what kind of illness I had. The only thing they did was prepare my will and my coffin. When I got to the hospital here in Cange, Dr. Paul told me, "No, you're not going to die yet." [Farmer] Nobody died in that treatment group. And so, the outcomes were just as good, or better, than in the United States, because we had a community health worker system… [speaking French creole] What do you see here in this drawing? Since 2000, I teach patients about tuberculosis and HIV every day. I speak to them before they are seen by a doctor. Who knows what they're doing in this picture? Since he is sick, he is taking his family to be tested to see if they're sick too. By 2001, we decided, with this handful of patients, about 50, 60 patients, we were going to write a little article, saying, "We treated 60 patients for free in Haiti, and they all gained weight." [Farmer] There really weren't a lot of AIDS treatment programs, and as far as I know, none of them were in rural areas. We thought it was worthy of underlining, "Look. If you can do this in rural, central Haiti, with community-based care, with community health workers, then you can do it anywhere." It was published in The Lancet, which is a big, hoity-toity journal. And here I was, like, so proud. It was the first article that I was ever a part of writing. I sent it to my parents. So, we had a lot of response to that paper. The scientific community hated it. They hated it. [Farmer] The expert opinion was just, "Too expensive, it's not cost-effective, it's not sustainable." [Mukherjee] They said, "There's no data, it's not sustainable, it's silly, it's gold-plated. This could never be replicated." It was almost the exact same argument that we're having with MDR. The power of deja vu there was just overwhelming. These drugs cost $12,000 a year, per patient. So, the notion that you would invest resources in HIV treatment in Haiti, or in Africa, just seemed like an idea from outer space. Half of the budget is for anti-retrovirals. If we had them today, we could not distribute them. We could not administer the program because we don't have the doctors, we don't have the roads, we don't have the cold chain. First of all, in their scripts, we are black, uneducated, of course, stupid. If we give them the drugs, they will not take them on time. You know those black people, they don't have a watch. ANDREW NATSIOS: If you've traveled to rural Africa, you know this. People do not know what watches and clocks are. They do not use Western means for telling time. They use the sun. These drugs have to be administered during a certain sequence of time during the day. And when you say, "Take it at ten o'clock," people will say, "What do you mean by ten o'clock?" First of all, that's not true, about the medication. And in fact, they also did have watches, I might add. The dollars available are limited. I have to ask you if it isn't more effective to concentrate almost entirely on the prevention part of this thing. Really. The mindset obstacles, the institutional obstacles, were just enormous. The lack of infrastructure, the disbursement of the appropriate, uh, medicines, is so primitive. These were just excuses. It was all about money. [all speaking indistinctly] [news anchor on TV] It's hard to overstate the scale of the AIDS crisis. Twelve million people have little or no access to the drugs they need. It costs about £3,000 a year for the drugs each sufferer needs. Globally, that's a bill of £40 billion. By the year 2000, I was inquiring of colleagues around Harvard what could really be done about AIDS. Paul said, "Well, we're doing it." [Farmer] Jeff Sachs said, "I'll go to Haiti with you." And he did. He met Adeline in the middle of nowhere, in a village where there's no electricity, hours from a road, doing really well. [Sachs] We saw a woman, uh, robust and healthy, and going about her daily life. [Mukherjee] Jeff looked at our model, made some little marks, and he costed it out on the back of an envelope, and he said, "Yeah. This is what I think we need to spread this globally." [Farmer] We were saying, "Well, we need X number of millions of dollars." He said, "Forget the M-word." [chuckling] "You don't need the M-word. You need the B-word. You need billions of dollars to go in this." And meanwhile, the AIDS activists were making a ruckus around the world. [chanting in protest] We just want an opportunity. [crowd cheers] An opportunity to live! [Farmer] I had been invited to debate a guy from the World Bank. The World Bank had not been endorsing AIDS treatment. [Mead Over] You made a compelling, emotional argument, Paul. Yet I hope that even those among you who are firmly convinced by Dr. Farmer's forceful presentation, will suspend your judgment for the next few minutes to listen to a different view. [Sawyer] He was saying, "Prevention, that's the only thing that works." [Over] I conclude the government should pay more attention to prevention because much of prevention would not be done without government intervention. [Sawyer] And that you don't give a man a fish, you teach him how to fish. It's important to note that it's not just that people haven't been taught to fish. Their boats have been destroyed, their nets shredded, and, you know, uh, their fleets have been sunk. [Farmer] AIDS activists, they had been saying the same thing. You can't say that Africans with AIDS can't get treatment. That's bullshit. Bankers in general, they… My suspicion is that they're not getting a lot of sex, because they spend a lot of time screwing the poor. [all laughing and applauding] [protestors chanting] Shame, shame, shame! My friends in Africa and other developing countries die within just a couple of years of being diagnosed with HIV, because they have no access to treatment. [all chanting in protest] [Sawyer] We were like, "We're gonna put pressure on the drug companies, we're gonna put pressure on governments," while people like Paul and Jim at Partners in Health were saying, "We'll provide proof that drugs can be used in resource-poor developing countries, effectively." None of our patients have died. One person died a few days after starting therapy, because we started too late. And isn't that a lesson of the last 20 years? We started too late. We always start too late. [audience applauding] [Mukherjee] People were saying, "Wow, if they can do this in Haiti, we can do this in Thailand." "If they can do this in Haiti, we can do it in Soweto, if they can do this in Haiti, we can do it in Siemreab." And people started talking about the Haiti model. And our patients wrote something that is called the Declaration of Cange. And they said, "We have benefitted from the fruits of science, and we think our brothers and sisters in Africa should too." [woman speaking French creole] The Cange Declaration. We the patients of Partners In Health here in Cange, have written this declaration to share with you all. It is we who are sick, it is therefore we who take responsibility to declare our suffering, our misery, our pain, and also, our hope. We have a message for you who suffer from the same sickness as we do. Do not get discouraged because you do not have medications. We pledge to remain steadfast in this fight for treatment. We have a message for the big shots, for those from other countries as well as from Haiti, we ask that you be concious of all that we endure. We entreat you to put aside your egotism because all humans are human. We are indeed poor, but our poverty does not make us stupid. -[audience applauding on video] -Wow. Um… You know, like, uh, any declaration, Alma-Ata, any others, you know, you want to believe it matters. But the difference between the two is pretty shocking, of course, or striking, right? One is… A declaration made by the ministers of health and other political figures. The other is… Is the meaning of displaying a different kind of expertise. You know? [speaking French creole] We said, "All humans are human." We all have the right to good health so we can live. All humans are human. You might be rich, I might be poor, but our blood is the same. That's why if the wealthy can find treatment, so must we. [Sachs] I went back and saw then-Secretary General Kofi Annan, who said, "This really can be done, this can be done at scale," and here's how it can work. In 2001, there was a UN special session. Kofi Annan had called for the creation of a fund that would help poor governments treat HIV in their countries, and that later came to be called the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. [Kofi Annan] I propose the creation of a global fund dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS -and other infectious diseases. -[assembly applauding] [Mukherjee] The Global Fund was created with the idea that HIV treatment is possible, and it must be possible because they're doing it in rural Haiti. If you talk to people now, everyone will tell you that they were for HIV treatment in the late 90's and early 2000's, but that's just not true. They were a very, very small group of people, um, who were in favor of it. The most remarkable person, I have to say, who changed his mind, is George W. Bush. [Farmer] Anthony Fauci, who was head of NIAID, called me and said, "You should come to Washington for a meeting in the White House the day after tomorrow." And I said, "Really?" I remember going in and bringing some before and after pictures. I was really nervous. They were saying, "How are we going to get these anti-retroviral medications to poor people?" And I just said, "I know we can do this because we already have in central Haiti, and you don't need infectious disease doctors like me, what you really need are community health workers." There was a wave of doubters, and I was skeptical that we had convinced them. [Sawyer] I'll never forget the day, it was January 28th, 2003. PEPFAR, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, came out of the blue. [Bush] Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean. [Congress applauding] [Sawyer laughing] I said, "Holy shit!" Actually, I think I had the word "F" in there. [chuckles] I was blindsided. I couldn't believe it. This was really an incredibly gutsy decision to make, and it was done, as far as we can tell… I've never spoken to him about this. It was done on the basis of compassion. When the Global Fund and PEPFAR came online, all of a sudden we were talking about ten billion dollars a year, for three diseases, uh, that before was maybe getting a couple hundred million. And so right then we understood that the fight had changed. Where my big challenge is, is how can we help revive the public health system in order to deliver the right… The services we want to deliver. [Mukherjee] Once we had the Global Fund and PEPFAR, we said, "You know what? The health system in Haiti is falling apart." So we strategically made a big decision that year. Let's use that money to revitalize the public sector. To work with the Haitian government to build health systems, to train doctors and nurses, to put the resources and the structures in place to do it. This is gonna be a new hospital. We will be reclaiming little bits of this, corner by corner till it looks like Cange. Hinche, the TB center starting next month, Thomonde, the public health clinic. Lascahobas, the future headquarters of this whole expansion. If we're not everywhere in all these places, really seriously a presence, then we're not doing our job and we're way behind schedule. Put Cange on the map. We knew it could take months for the money to be released, and that time would cost lives. People are dying everyday. For them, we are not rushing. [laughs] "What are you waiting for?" [Dahl] We said, "Let's talk to Tom White." Tom said, "I don't have that much left." But he said, "Take a loan from Citizens Bank in Newton." You can use my home as collateral. So this was getting down to the wire for Tom. [Mukherjee] We said, "We're gonna put essential drugs in the clinics. Not HIV drugs, we're gonna put those too. TB drugs, amoxicillin, family planning, and then we're gonna hire, and train, and pay, a big army of community health workers." So we were pumping our money into the public sector. And then, you know, if people came in, they were sick, we say, "Hey, you want an HIV test?" "Okay." And most people don't have HIV. But they're getting healthcare. [speaking French creole] [cheering and clapping] [Dahl] Our strategy of taking AIDS money and using it to build the healthcare infrastructure in this one small part of central Haiti was attracting attention around the world. The hard lessons we had learned over 20 years were starting to pay off. And then we had a chance to do the same thing for an entire country, to really test the dream that healthcare for all is possible on a much larger scale. And that's when I met Dr. Agnes Binagwaho, at this big AIDS meeting. It was the first time she ever went to New York. She walked off the plane with a bag full of articles and commentary and we hit it off. You can tell she's a leader and isn't very shy. Oh, I was quite impressed because there were all so many knowledgeable people in that room. People who give their view and the world through their view. But there were quite saying nonsense, you know. And I said, "My goodness, if this, we had to follow that, we go nowhere." So, as I'm very talkative, I start to talk a lot and to tell them. "You know, the real life is not what you see here." Come in Africa and I will show you." [Dahl] Rwanda was a country that had been through massive suffering because of outside intervention, including colonialism, World Bank policies, eventually leading to devastating outcomes. [journalist 1] UN officials say they have never seen anything like it. [journalist 2] The true horrors of this month-long war are only now beginning to emerge. [journalist 3] Social services are broken down. The homes are destroyed. Victims of the atrocities do not have the medical attention they need. [Dahl] When the genocide was over, the new leaders resolved to rebuild the country, and it was sometime after that we were invited in. The government here is organized. There's political will to get things done in healthcare. [Mukherjee] What the government of Rwanda saw was an NGO, Partners in Health, that was using HIV money to revitalize primary healthcare, and that was one of their real big mandates after the genocide, was to rebuild the healthcare system as a way to promote peace and stability. [speaking indistinctly] [Binagwaho] In 2000, we create an action plan designed with the entire country. And it's Vision 2020. We just say, "We need to reach there, those are our targets, how are we going to do that?" It's very ambitious. [Farmer] We thought, with the right support, we could take the model that we developed with our Haitian colleagues and see it brought to some kind of scale. [Binagwaho] They said, " We are experts in rural care and treatment." So we told them, "Okay, let's give you the worst place in Rwanda." There was nothing in that area. There was a former hospital that has been totally damaged by the genocide. [Dahl] It looked like it had been raided, and… That was the hospital for this community. So we began to bring some of our Haitian colleagues who had been treating HIV and training community-health workers. [Fernet Leandre] Under the tree, under the tent, wherever you could save lives, you start. [Peter Niyigena speaking native language] I was one of the first four recruited by Partners In Health. [Mukherjee] We started going house-to-house and people were so sick. -[speaking in French creole] Dr. Eugene. -[baby crying] Dr. Eugene, she needs urgent care right away. She's dying. We need oxygen. [in English] She's dying. I think it's too late. [speaking native language] Joia carried patients on her back. This motivated us. It struck us to see a concerned foreigner helping our own, we got really challenged. [man 1 in English] Watch out, watch out, watch out. [Kim] The history of the genocide took everything to another level in terms of the emotional intensity. [Farmer speaking French] This is a fragment from a grenade. [in English] This child needs the OR. [speaking French] Did they know it was a grenade? No, they didn't know. [in English] They were playing. Like kids. [man speaking foreign language] So many people turned up. We tested their blood. Among those tested, half of them were HIV positive. [Kim] The government wanted to place three community health workers in every village in the country. 45,000 strong. [speaking French] You must always be engaged and have conviction in this battle. You can change the condition of your brothers. [Leandre in English] We have people with the symptom and people who have to deal with the same social determinants. [people speaking indistinctly] This was the first place that I ever saw the country pushing Paul on thinking big. [Binagwaho] We give a phone to our community-health workers that people can borrow. And we create an SMS platform linked, so that our people that doesn't have internet can ask any question by SMS. -[man] This one has an urgent question. -[Binagwaho] Yes. He's saying, [speaking French creole] the health center in Gasabo is out of TB tests. Who is the director of the nearest hospital there? [in English] We'll call him right away. This is stressing me out, Doc. -It's stressing you? -Yeah. It's stressing me in a good way. [speaking indistinctly] [Binagwaho] Are you still in the hospital? Go back home passing through a health center and call us back. You'll do a letter for me on Monday. Copy to all the health centers, so that this will never happen again. You start to dream and to work together, since we have the same vision of what a human is entitled to. [Farmer] Things like cancer care, surgery, that's what they don't have here. [crowd speaking indistinctly] [Binagwaho] We are starting a systematic screening for all adults to see what our population is suffering through. We see a new set of disease, many cancer. [Dr. Peter Drobac] We saw many women in their mid-to-late thirties dying in agony, of metastatic cervical cancer. It's the biggest cancer killer of women in Africa. Around the same time, it became a vaccine-preventable illness, when the Human papillomavirus vaccine was approved. So Rwanda mobilized every community health worker in the country, went out to every school in the country… They did it. They vaccinated 93% of all 13-year-old girls. [Drobac] The rest of the world noticed. People wrote articles in The Lancet, in premier global health journals, criticizing Rwanda for giving the cervical cancer vaccine to 12-year-old girls because it could divert attention away from more pressing health problems. [Farmer] I have a lot of respect and a lot of sympathy for colleagues who object to change… But I have more sympathy for the patients. [Binagwaho] This debate is because they are from a poor country, they should not have access to treatment make me furious. Massive costs will prevent many countries from providing treatment at large-scale. Countries cannot treat their way out of non-communicable diseases. I want to emphasize "sustainable." Do what you can with what you have, where you're at. There are people who just say, "Too expensive for you." Who they are to tell us that when they have managed to mobilize? Who are they to say that this is too good for our people? [man] These low-to-middle income countries, they need to resist the temptation to want the latest, most expensive technologies. [Binagwaho] I am accountable to our people, you are accountable to who? People are dying, my brother. So, we commit to treat every cancer possible. And to mobilize as crazy to provide them treatment. We want oncologists, we want pathologists, we need them. Rwanda did something interesting. They said, "We're actually gonna use our international aid to train the next generation of Rwandan health professionals." And they said, "Look, we don't need people from DC coming to give a PowerPoint to tell us how poor we are. What we need is a doctor to train our doctors." Now I want to invite to the stage Agnes Binagwaho, the Minister of Health of Rwanda. [all applauding] [Binagwaho] We negotiate with the US government to divert a portion of the money they give us for health to produce the doctors we need for the future. [Bill Clinton] All the schools will send 100 faculty members to Rwanda a year, helping Rwanda strengthen its national health education system so that it is sustainable and will be able to be run and funded by the Rwandan government itself. [Dahl] One of the things that we and our Rwandan colleagues have always been able to do is to make sure that what we're doing is always so ambitious that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable. [Drobac] A lot of people were scratching their heads and saying, "Why are you introducing cancer care in Rwanda?" I mean, surely you don't need to do that right now because you haven't yet done this. [Binagwaho] You know, that time it was HIV, couple of years later, it was HPV vaccine, tomorrow it will be cancer treatment, it will be always there. They don't believe that we have equal right to life. An equal right to dignity, an equal right to say what is our own future. [engine whirring] [Barack Obama] Good morning, everybody. Despite its name, the World Bank is more than just a bank. It's one of the most powerful tools we have to reduce poverty, and raise standards of living in some of the poorest countries on the planet. And that's why the leader of the World Bank should have a deep understanding of both the role that development plays in the world, and the importance of creating conditions where assistance is no longer needed. I believe that nobody is more qualified to carry out that mission than Doctor Jim Kim. It's time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency. And that's why today, after a careful and thorough search, I'm nominating Dr. Jim Kim to be the next president of the World Bank. Thank you. Holy shit. The next World Bank leader is a leader in world health issues. President Obama picked somebody who literally, everybody who wrote about this today, described as a surprise. [news anchor on TV] This is a big change. He doesn't have an economics background, he doesn't have a finance background, and he certainly doesn't have a political background. [Kim] I spent a lot of my time at Partners in Health critiquing the World Bank. Because it made no sense that there were so many resources in the world, and so few were used to stop people from dying from what Paul calls, "stupid diseases." All of us, even though we were critiquing the World Bank, we all had great hopes that if the World Bank would focus their attention on something, that things would happen. And now, in my job at the World Bank Group, it's especially a belief that there's no such thing as a country that is a basket case. [Dahl] It felt like a long time coming. But it was an amazing outcome to see one of our closest friends influencing on all the issues affecting the poor from the inside. And as it turned out, it was just in time. [Binagwaho] We continue to improve. Our people are in better health. But we have more challenges because we don't have enough-- [door opening] [film crew member] I'm sorry, can we hold for one second? -[speaking French] Is there a problem? -[man speaking in French] Yes. [speaks French] Oh, lala. [man] Dr. Thierry wants to speak to you right away. Hello, Thierry. Yes. He came from where? Isolation directly. Don't call me, take him straight to the hospital. You must get a room ready immediately. And get his chart. No, do not send a doctor, send an ambulance. You cannot put more people at risk. You take him there, he sleeps there, you do an exam. Draw a blood sample and make sure it gets to the lab in Kampala by this evening. And isolate everyone who has been in contact with him. All of them in isolation, blocked. Block him. [in English] Thank you. First suspected case of Ebola. [news anchor on TV] Threats of the deadly Ebola virus finally landing in the East African region. The Rwanda Ministry of Health has come up to assure the public that it is just a suspected case, and that tests are still ongoing. [sirens wailing] All borders are informed and screen anyone coming in Rwanda. And when there is fever, they call us. We have now somebody coming from Congo who has fever. So we're going to isolate another person. If there is any risk, we put that person in isolation. We take the blood and the blood go to an international lab. If they are positive, we will quarantine all the people that have been in contact with the person from another country. Today we have put certain people in quarantine for 21 days. Hm? We have no choice. That's what we do to assure that the country is safe. A young German coming from an Ebola country has fever. Sign of Ebola. We had to isolate him to put all the measure against Ebola. [Drobac] The government of Rwanda was trying to respond as quickly as possible. You know, in order to respond effectively, you have to have a functioning health system. [Binagwaho] The community health workers know what to do and each health center at the border. [Farmer] So, uh, what is… going on with Ebola? It will break my budget. Yeah, that's what I heard, the isolation. I mean… [Binagwaho] No, we have isolation in each hospital of the country. -We have checking at 17 borders. -Yeah. [Binagwaho] Because this virus is not like the previous one. Yeah. Previous one should be over for more than a month. [Farmer] Yeah, it's the longest outbreak. -Don't be afraid, guys. -Yeah. [news anchor on TV] The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the world's deadliest to date. As health officials in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone struggle to control the virus. [Farmer] This is not about Ebola. This is because of a failed health care system. [Kim] It became clearer and clearer to me that this was getting completely out of hand. The infections disease doctors I know were more scared than I'd ever seen them before. [Farmer] I was feeling panicky. It was already wiping out the caregivers, including the professionals. [Kim] I called Paul, and Paul said, "Oh, my God, it's so bad. This is the worst thing any of us have ever seen." I said, "You should ring every alarm that you can as president of the World Bank, and do what banks do. Get us some money." Then I took a look. It turned out that nobody had provided any funding for Ebola. That's not what the World Bank normally does. But a crisis like that can affect the global economy. I want to welcome everyone for this extremely important… Important meeting. Unless we quickly contain and stop the Ebola epidemic, nothing less than the future, of not only West Africa, but perhaps even Africa is at stake. [Arthur Kleinman] I can't imagine that there would have been another president of the World Bank who could have gotten the bank to invest $500 million into the Ebola epidemic. [Kim] The World Bank Group had evolved a lot, over years, well before I got there. And with Ebola, we knew we had to act. This is just crazy, the analysis shows us that it's… It's absolutely idiotic not to invest more in health. Can we do something that makes the case more broadly? I mean, this is important. [female consultant] We're hoping to build on that case, that through community health workers. I mean, they are critical in reaching out to the underserved, making the connections, and it proved very important in Ebola responses, you know. [Mukherjee] By August of 2014, we were invited to both Liberia and Sierra Leone by the governments to have a hand in the fight. Liberia has lost too many doctors, too many nurses, along with too many citizens because, again, of the lack of staff and stuff. That's what's going to build our national capacity to do it ourselves. It's not rocket science, right? Rebuilding a health system in Liberia or anywhere else. The only impediments in our way are those who are gonna argue that we don't need the staff, stuff, space and systems. Hello. Ambassador? Good morning. [Binagwaho] There was a real risk to have brought Ebola into Rwanda. So we did a test on a patient that could be affected by Ebola. And I was called with the result. You're welcome, sir. Bye. [speaking French] Health sector workers, good morning. Good news. Negative to Ebola. [crowd cheering and applauding] [in English] We all know that it is a strong health system that allow to be prepared. That allow you to respond in case of an emergency response. [Farmer] Rwanda is the most dramatic arc from complete misery and devastation to a recovery. We dream big without having anything. Now we have universal access to treatment, life expectancy have doubled. [Farmer] These declines in mortality are probably the steepest declines in mortality ever recorded anywhere, at any time. I'm going to sleep very well this night. -I tell you. -[all laughing] We were nowhere and now the people are looking at us to have advice, "How to make it?" Hm? [Kim] Optimism is a moral choice. If you walk into this work, and you're cynical and you're pessimistic, well, you know, you probably will live out your very low ambitions. -[people speaking indistinctly] -[camera shutter clicking] -[speaking French] -[all laughing] [Dahl] Early in 2011, we broke ground on a new teaching hospital in Mirebalais just down the road from where I met Paul all those years ago. We'd always had planned to build a hospital there. But we changed the scope of it after the earthquake twelve months before. It was one of the most unimaginably terrible disasters. In less than one minute, so many hundreds of thousands of people died. I don't think that we had imagined anything quite like that. [speaking in French creole] [Dahl] Over the years, we had worked closely with the Ministry of Health in Haiti to build a dozen hospitals and clinics that belonged to the country. But after the earthquake, we realized Haiti really needed something we had long dreamed of… A major national teaching hospital owned by the people, through the government to treat patients, to train Haitian doctors, nurses and specialists. And make it into something that would actually change things for the future. [Farmer] Every time I go by that hill where I met Ophelia, I just… Get a real kick [laughs] out of going… Out of going over that bridge, and waiting for a modern hospital to loom into view. [Farmer speaking foreign language] I was very proud as someone who was there when all the work began, because we had built everything on our shoulders. [Dahl] To come back to that place, and to now see this… sprawling tertiary hospital, I'm reminded of the road that had to be traveled on to get that hospital there. And how this whole process has been amplified thousands and thousands of times, so that we now have many different people working in many different countries. [both speaking in a foreign language] The key is to have a pessimism of the intellect, but an optimism of the will. [Farmer] You can't pretend that these problems don't exist, right? Or that they don't have solutions. You know, health for all still needs to be the future. [speaking foreign language] All humans are human. Because of this, I'm alive today and I would like all the poor to survive as well. [speaking indistinctly] [Dahl] So much of this work is built on… love. And that means going through very difficult times together. And sticking with it. -[Kim speaking Spanish] -Si. [Farmer] To me, this is about hope. And it's about rejecting despair and cynicism. [both exclaiming] [speaking indistinctly] [Lafontant speaking foreign language] It goes back to the beginning of Cange, from where we were, to today, that we can offer the hospitality to others, with hope. Because hope keeps us alive. I suppose we did well. If I leave, I leave with a joyful heart. [speaking foreign language] I'd lost all hope. [man speaking foreign language] You had lost hope, how about now? -Now… -Hope has returned. Hope has returned. [laughs] Hope has returned. [exclaims] When I was in high school, I wrote a paper saying why the right to health care was bad. [cameraman laughing] -What an idiot. -[cameraman laughs] It's a medical complex in the middle of a squatter settlement. You know, a major medical center in the middle of a squatter settlement. So, of course a lot of people think that's completely nuts. But the locals think it's great. Because they think, "Well, we lost our land, we lost our water, we lost everything, but we have a medical center." So, hey, I don't know. It's not what the development experts say to do, but… They also had jobs. [speaking foreign language] [clucking] [speaking foreign language] [giggles] [Farmer in English] She puts a chicken in my hospital, then it becomes my chicken. [music playing on car radio] Oh, this is my song. Music. ♪ So long! ♪ [turns up pop music on the radio] [male singer singing indistinctly] -Beautiful. -[woman] It's beautiful. Okay, so, let's go. We see each other as brother and sister. [Kim] Yeah. What does that mean? It means that we see each other as family. Yeah, because, also that, we both, each other, never had a brother or sister. So, we are kind of related, especially when our fathers are both best friends. They always lived with each other. [Farmer and Kim chuckling] [both laughing] Ah… Don't make us cry. -[laughing] Don't make us cry. -[laughing] [boy] What's so funny? -It's very nice. It's not funny. -It's very nice. -It's very nice. Come here guys. -It's very moving.
