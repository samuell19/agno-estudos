When you a imagine a woman eating out by herself, it may conjure a lonely image, but... That's not true at all. You can eat what you want, when you want to. That's an incredibly happy thing. But, there aren't many restaurants that are easy for a woman to go into alone. That looks delicious. It seems like it has a good atmosphere too. I'll eat here. Cheers! It's all couples. I messed up. So, to make myself feel better, I bought myself ice cream. This is also something fun I can do because I'm alone. Fujiwara no Yorimichi had the Byoudoin Phoenix Hall built in Uji. The Amida Nyorai statue is inside this building. This Amida Hall expresses the sophistication of the art from the Jodo sect to modern society... ...making it an architectural treasure. Let's see, the most important points about Natsume Soseki's novel "Kokoro" are... Um... Huh? Sensei, we're on page 139. 139... Let's see, page 139... Huh? I wonder where they're being taken from? Yeah, there's so many... Is something wrong? Oh, please look at this. Oh. Those are students at this school, aren't they? One of the student's parents happened to find this site, and notified us. These are being taken in secret as the students go to and from school. It's disgusting. Oh. Those pictures are pretty good. What? That model telephoto lens is pretty good. That's not the issue here. What do you mean? Because these photos are being taken without their knowledge... ...it probably means that our students have become the target of some pervert. If we don't do something, it's possible that this could develop into a case of stalking, or worse. Oh... Let's contact the site administrator and see if we can get the photos removed. Yes. Oh, Principal... This is a problem, isn't it? Let's call the police as well. No, if this gets blown out of proportion then the school's reputation might suffer. This isn't the time to be worrying about the school's reputation... Besides, the police won't do anything just because a few pictures were taken. And, the issue of having your likeness used is a civil matter, not a police one. I see. Then, for the time being, why don't we have the teachers patrol the route to and from school? Yes. Students, recently those going to and from school... ...have had their pictures taken... ...and these pictures have subsequently been published on the internet. This is completely outrageous. Please be vigilant and take care. How can we be careful if they're being taken secretly? I dunno. It's impossible. That's right. So, what're we doing? Hey! What year are you? 2nd years? Go home quickly! It's dangerous. - Good bye! - Don't stop for snacks either! Let's go. - C'mon, go home now. - Good bye! 2nd year, go home! Let's go. Go straight home, okay? Okay. Hey... Why are you just dilly-dallying like that? You have to patrol properly, you know. Yes. Teachers really have to do a lot of different stuff, don't they? That's right. This is also an important part of being a teacher. So, how're things? Have you gotten used to your classes yet? My legs have quit shaking, at least. You're still at that level? I get the feeling the students don't take me very seriously. It's not just a feeling. Isn't that the truth? What should I do? To become a teacher they'll take seriously... ...you just have to become a respectable man first. So, what is a "respectable man?" What? Basically... To not get agitated by little things... ...and always be dignified... Basically, someone that you can depend on. Oh. I think that's completely impossible for me. I see. Hey. They're smoking. They really are. Let's warn them. What? They're students at another school. But, we can't just let them be. We're teachers, you know. Before we're that, we're just people. What is that attitude? Go on, go! Me? This is your chance to be a respectable man! - Go! - Huh? I can't. Geez. I guess there's no helping it. Hey, you kids... What is it, old lady? Old lady? What do you mean, "old lady?" And what's your definition of an "old lady?" You're an old lady 'cuz you don't walk around with bare legs. What? What's wrong with not having bare legs? Um, you're getting off-topic... Oh, you're right... High school students shouldn't smoke cigarettes. Shut up! Go away. Besides, do you really think your hair looks cool like that? It looks like a...like a rooster. An old lady wouldn't understand my fashion sense. In any case, the law says that minors can't smoke cigarettes! Shut up! Who decided that? W-what do you mean, "who?" Oh, hey, Akiyama-sensei! You're so loud. Look at that! - That camera has a telephoto lens on it. - What? You don't normally wander around with a lens like that on your camera. Let's go. I'll keep these until you all turn 20. - Hey! - Give those back! Hey! Ow! What are you doing? Hey, are you okay? I'm fine. Are you mad? Not really. It's not your fault, right? You're mad... I heard Kamisaka-sensei was injured... Are you okay? He only got some scrapes from falling. It's not serious enough to worry yourself over, Principal. Oh... yes. But, young people nowadays will quit over the tiniest things, so... Please don't worry. I won't quit over something like this. Really? More importantly, we found someone who might be the culprit, but he got away. Don't overdo it, okay? What would you have done if the person was dangerous? If you find someone again, don't try to catch him, and just call the police, okay? Okay. Alright, I'm all done. Thanks. If you'll excuse me... Oh, um... How is he doing? The road to becoming a proficient teacher is very long, isn't it? He's just not very reliable. I see. Why did you choose him? I'm sure there were other more responsible candidates, weren't there? Well... But, aren't you and Kamisaka-sensei a good team, Akiyama-sensei? I don't remember ever teaming up with him! Helping new teachers develop is also an important part of our jobs. Right? Please look after him. Okay... [Koe wo kikasete] Let me hear your voice. [Sunao ni nareba kitto...] If you can become honest with yourself, I'm sure... [wakari aeru hazu sa] ...we'll start to understand each other. Ohitorisama [kokoro wo hiraite...] Open your heart... [Listen up, baby girl. Kimi wo kikasete] Listen up, baby girl. Let me hear you. [Aruite kita michi wo] The road we walked together... [Bokutachi ni totte kioku] ...will become our memories. [Taisetsu na step sa] It's an important step... [Sono no mirai he no] ...towards the future. Akiyama-sensei! Can I walk home with you? Sure, but why? Did something happen? With all this stuff happening, I got a little scared. Nothing says that the students are the only targets, right? That's true. Then, shall we go as far as the station together? Yes. I never had the time to consider the possibility I might be targeted too. I've been a little scared since a college student followed me in my neighborhood recently. Really? But, that happens to you too, right Akiyama-sensei? Huh? Yeah... That's why I always make sure I have this when I go anywhere. An alarm keychain and pepper spray. Wow... You don't have them, Akiyama-sensei? Even though you were telling all the students to get them... I'm fine. I guess you're right. But, having a man around to protect you is the best, right? Yeah... - It went off. Let me have it. [SAVE ME!!] Are you looking for one for a child? If so, how about one of these? No, I'm looking for one for myself. Um, I don't think you should go with one of those... Why not? If, while being attacked, you hit someone with that and they get injured... ...you can get charged with "excessive self defense," which is a crime. Excuse me... Do I really look like I'd beat someone up that badly? If you'd please put that down first... - Oh. - Hey. What were you doing? I was doing some shopping. How about you? Why are you in this area? I was hungry, so I thought I'd eat something before I went home. Oh, I see. Usually I'd make something when I got home, but I've been getting home kind of late, so... What were you going to eat? Let's see... I think over there. You're young, so you need to eat better food. I've eaten here every day this week. You have some really poor eating habits, don't you? Well, I am poor. After being told that, an older person would have no choice but to treat you, you know. Do you often come here by yourself? Yeah, that's right. What did you just buy? Hm? Oh... The students have them, so... ...I thought I should, too. These. Wow, an alarm keychain? Do you want to say that I don't need it? Not at all. I have one too. Why? I was chased through the city by a gay old man once. I was traumatized. Wow... Really? I wonder why he did that even though I wasn't interested. Because you look defenseless, probably. It must be nice for you, since you don't look defenseless. What is that? That doesn't sound like a compliment. I didn't mean it like that at all. In any case, it's because men are unreliable, isn't it? That's why women think, "I have to be responsible," and get stronger... ...so that they look like don't have any weaknesses. So, what do you want me to do about it? Well, asking me isn't... Okay... - Good evening. - Good evening. Oh! - Akiyama-san, Akiyama-san! - Yes? You know, earlier today this man was here... He asked me about you. What? A man? What kind of person was he? Well, you know, he looked really suspicious. Though, I did tell him I didn't know anything about you. Oh... Thank you. Good night. You have one new message. 8:08 PM. It happened again? Yes. This was taken yesterday. How can you tell? Look. Right here. It's yesterday's date. If I had caught him yesterday... There's trouble! What's wrong? Minami was... What happened? She hasn't said anything since she got here. Just calm down and tell us what happened. I thought I was going to be late, so I took a shortcut... And then a strange man... Did he do anything to you? No, nothing. I ran away as quickly as I could. Is she injured? No, she isn't. I see... Shall we call the police? You're right. But, first we need to tell the principal. Then, I'll go tell her. You should go home for the day. I'll call your parents and have someone come pick you up. I can go home by myself. Oh, but, we'd worry about you, so... Could someone walk me home? Let's see... Then, I'll ask a teacher who has first period free... I'd like Kamisaka-sensei to do it, please. Eh? What? One of the parents of the student attacked, Saegusa-san, is a PTA officer. It's very possible that they'll lodge some sort of complaint. But, we did everything we could to warn the students! Um... but, what if they ask why we didn't immediately go to the police based on yesterday's incident? That... That's really bad. Oh! We could try telling Saegusa-san's parents that the principal was completely responsible for that... Yes! That's right! We can turn a pinch into a chance! You... You make good observations. Thank you. Not you. Sensei... Do you want to go somewhere with me? Huh? Like an amusement park... Oh, I have classes, so I couldn't do that. So, you would if you didn't have classes then. What? Could I have a few minutes? Ick. What did you need? Where were you attacked by the man? Um... The narrow street next to the book store. Really? That's strange. What is? When I passed by there this morning, they were doing construction. What? How did you pass through there? That's right. It was a different street. The next one up. Which one? Are saying that I'm a liar? No, I'm not. That's what you mean, isn't it? How mean. Hey. I'll walk you home! I'm fine. I'll take a taxi. Ready and... Ready and... Ready and... I wonder if Minami's okay... Yeah, I'm a little worried about her. We could try telling her parents that the principal was completely responsible for that... Wow, you collected a lot, didn't you? Principal! Oh, Akiyama-sensei! Could I talk to you? Sure. Take of things, okay? Yes. Actually... I overheard the vice principal and his group saying... ...that they'd place all responsibility for this last incident on you. I see. What should we do? Let them do what they want. Are you sure? It's not something you should be worrying about, right? Yes, but... When I think that if I had caught that man yesterday, this wouldn't have happened, then... We don't know if the man taking the pictures and the man who attacked Saegusa-san... ...are the same person yet. Do we? That's true, but... It's just, so many problems are popping up... ...I feel that I should be doing something... ...but I don't know what to do. Do you have some time tonight? Eh? Yes. Oh, but... Hm? Did you have plans? I already have reservations, so... I see. A date? No. Just for me. I see. So, what sort of place is it? When I start to get stressed out, I come here. When I'm doing this, it sort of feels like I can clear my head... It really does. You seem like you know about lots of good things to do. I hope you'll continue to tell me about them. If you're fine with me, then... Oh, that's right, did you have something you wanted to talk to me about? Would it be okay if I talked to you later? Okay, just... It's done. It's ripples. You should've called. I couldn't help it. Come in. Oh. This is my younger sister Sayaka. She said she fought with our parents, and ran away from home. Hello. I'm going to live in Tokyo. Let me stay here until I find a place. Look, you can't just drop in on me... It's fine, isn't it? Please? Even if you say that... You're living by yourself, right? What? Huh? Are you packing up your stuff to leave? Thank you for taking care of me for such a long time. Don't worry about my sister. 3 people would be tough here. Do you even have a place to go? Well, I do have other friends. Okay. See ya. It's nice to have a way to release stress. I also go to other special lessons... ...or on a one-day plan at hotels. There are lots of ways. I see. But, the best thing is to not get stressed to begin with. That's what I wanted to talk about today. Yes? When I see you, you seem like you're trying just a little too hard. It reminded me of myself from a long time ago, so I was thinking about it. You take on everything by yourself... That may be true. It's not good never to depend on other people. Well, if I had such a person, then... Well, it's possible that they're near you, and you just aren't seeing them, right? Right? I bet you've worried about whether to get married or continue your job, right? What? How did you know that? I told you that you reminded me of myself. My. You know... I was married once. Really? "Married once," means that you broke up, right? We loved each other, but things didn't work out. Did you have any children? No... Oh, I'm sorry. It's fine. Here. Where? Over there. Oh! It really is that guy from yesterday. I came here and he happened to be here too. This looks like fun. Yeah, it does. This one too. Yes. Doesn't it? What do you want? You shouldn't be asking us that. Why are you running? You were chasing me! This... You took these, right? That's right. I knew it was you! Did you really think it was okay to do something like this? What's wrong with it? Of course taking those pictures was wrong! You were the one who attacked one of our students today too, aren't you? What're you talking about? You can't play dumb with me! There's a police box over there. I'll go. Wait right here! You take... ...really good pictures. I also do a bit of photography, but... ...my pictures never turn out as good as these. Thanks. But... why did you do something like this? Aren't there other things to take pictures of? If you wanted to take pictures of girls, you could ask your friends to model for you... I don't know how to talk to girls... I see. Am I... ...going to be picked up by the police? I thought it'd be okay if I didn't shoot their faces! I'm sorry! I won't do it again! Over there! What? Where is he? What's going on? He said he wouldn't do it anymore. Don't tell me you let him go? Yeah... Why'd you go and do that? Well, he promised me he wouldn't do it anymore. I don't think it's bad enough to call the police... How can you trust a guy like that? I can, because he promised. How can you say such naive things? Well, if you need anything else, please contact us. Excuse me. I'm sorry for troubling you. I thought we'd be able to resolve everything with this. And now we've got nothing. He wasn't the person that attacked Saegusa-san. A guy who can only take pictures of girls, not talk to them... ...I don't think he'd suddenly start attacking them. That's just conjecture, isn't it? Let's try to trust people more. I just want to give things careful consideration...and not get swept away by emotion. You'll be fine. You won't get swept away. You can live perfectly well by yourself. What do you mean "by yourself"? You're making me seem like a lonely woman. I didn't mean it like that. It was just sort of a slip of the tongue... Slip of the tongue? That means you actually feel that way! Huh? No. I'm sorry. Whatever. You have one new message. Again? The word "truth" that appears here... ...means, "validity" or "reality." However... ...this word "fact" can also be translated to mean "validity." So, what are the differences in the nuances of these words? Please look them up. Saegusa-san. In the end, I'm... ...just a liar, right? "Validity" and "reality" have nothing to do with me. We've increased the security measures here. Good work. We're counting on you. Indeed. If we don't have any more incidents after all this we can finally say that the incident from the other day... ...was caused by the principal's failure to handle the situation. Saegusa Minami's parents have said that they want to look into the principal's liability in this incident. Really? So this could be incident that ends the Tajima family's 4-generation-long control of the school... ...soon. That's right, Next Principal. I'll be counting on you, Next Vice Principal. Next Head-of-Year Teacher. Where were you attacked by the man? The narrow street next to the book store. That's strange... When I passed by there this morning, they were doing construction. That's right. It was a different street. The next one up. Everyone, can I have a bit of your time? A building near the location Saegusa-san was attacked had a security camera... ...so I asked to borrow the recording for that time. This is yesterday morning. It's right around here. Oh! She was telling the truth. Please pause it for a moment. It's not that camera kid from before. I... I guess not. I knew it. He was only taking pictures. He's not the type that'd attack a girl. Is this really the time to say something like that? Huh? I think I've seen him before somewhere... Oh! I know where I've seen him before! Do you often come here by yourself? That's right. I've seen this man twice. What? Twice? It has always been around Akiyama-sensei. What? Around me? Why? You don't have any idea why? No... Oh. Now that I think about it... Someone told me that a man was hanging around my apartment asking about me... And, I've gotten lots of answering machine messages where the person just hangs up... Which means... This man was actually targeting Akiyama-sensei, then. What? Me? Then why would he approach Saegusa-san? Maybe he just wanted to ask Saegusa-san about Akiyama-sensei? So that's all, huh? What do you mean, "that's all?" Oh nothing. Excuse me. However, if Akiyama-sensei is the person being targeted, then... What should I do? But this is now a private matter more than a school matter now, so... If Akiyama-sensei is being targeted, then we can't just turn our backs on her. You have said in the past that it's not the school's place to get involved in a teacher's private life... In any case, those extra security guards we requested? - Please cancel them. - Right away. Of course. Also... Uh... ...you see... - It's fine. - Excuse me, could you please cancel the extra security guards? I'll figure out something on my own. Okay, dismissed. I'm so glad things have gotten resolved. Indeed... Akiyama-sensei... In any case, you should go to the police, okay? I'll go with you. No, I'll be fine. I can go by myself. Really? What? Nothing. What did you want to talk to me about? I'm sorry. What? I know now that what you were saying is true. I apologize for doubting you. As long as you understand now, it's fine. It turns out that Akiyama-sensei was that man's real target. What? It wasn't me? That's right. So... you don't have to worry about anything anymore, okay? Okay. Therefore... ...you can't get away with playing a tragic heroine to get Kamisaka-sensei to pity you anymore, you know. Being spoken to that way is quite irritating. Nothing has happened yet, correct? But if I wait until something happens, it will be too late, won't it? There doesn't seem to be any proof that you're being targeted, and... ...we don't have the time or resources to respond to cases like that. That can't be... Have you ever had trouble with any man you were romantically involved with? Never. You don't? Well, I have been involved with men before, of course. I just... Hey! Who ordered the ten-don? I did! It was you? Fine. Whatever, then. Hey! Wait! What were you doing? I'll be safe if I stay at home. I'm hungry. It's empty! I should've bought something on my way home. I'm really hungry... No place will deliver at this time of night, either. It's a dead end. Huh? What? No! I forgot to put in batteries... Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop! It's me! It's me! Ow ow ow! Akiyama-sensei! Ouch! It's me, Kamisaka! My eyes! My eyes!! What are you doing? I wanted to protect you, Akiyama-sensei. Huh? What's wrong? It's that man! Do something! But, my eyes... Oh no, it's out. - Here, use mine. - What? Oh yeah. Is something wrong? Are you okay? What? No, you... I mean... What? Detective? So that means that man was a private eye, then? That's right. Here. Let's see... What? That's me! What? No, I... Apparently the vice principal's wife has thought that he's been cheating on her for a while. She happened to see that picture and decided that I was his mistress. So, she hired a private investigator to look into Akiyama-sensei's background. What a silly woman. Who'd normally make such an assumption from this picture? Um... have you done anything to make your wife suspicious of you normally? Well, that is to say, you know that I... ...would never do that... Well, let's keep this matter between us, shall we? If you wouldn't mind... These are the pictures that detective took? Yes. It seems like they're all shots of the two of you. Huh? That's all coincidence. There's nothing going on between us. Yes, I know that. I'm sorry about yesterday. It's fine. I did it without telling you, so... Why? Huh? Why did you come to protect me? You told me to become a "respectable man," but I'm no good at it... I have to "retrieve my dishonor." People usually say, "redeem my honor." Honestly. Are you really a language teacher? I'm sorry. But... Thank you. It was nothing. In the end, I wasn't even much help. That's not true. What? Having someone to worry about you... ...is nice, isn't it? Usually, I'm totally fine alone, but... ...when things like that happen... ...I realized that I didn't have anyone in the world who would protect me. It was really... ...disheartening. So, when you came, I was really relieved. And... ...just a little bit... ...I thought you looked gallant. Really? Hearing you say that makes me happy. By the way, do you often go to internet cafes? More than going there...right now I'm living there. What? What do you mean? I can't stay at my friend's place anymore. But, I don't have anywhere to go. You can't do that. It's actually pretty comfortable. They have computers, manga, and showers... ...and all the beverages are complimentary. That's not the issue here. Do you think you can set a good example for the students if you do that? And, if it got out that you were living in a Net Cafe, then... ...I, as your mentor, wouldn't have any credibility. But, I don't have any money. I guess there's no helping it. Then, I'll lend you some money. So, go rent an apartment. It's fine. I don't like to borrow money from people. Then what are you going to do? Well, I'll just let things be for now. What? You can come in now! Sorry to intrude on you. Let's see, you can sleep in that corner over there. Oh, okay. This is only until you get paid, okay? Also, and this is a given... ...don't try anything. Of course I won't. You're making it sound like I have no attractiveness as a woman. Can you really imagine anything going on between the two of us? I can't. Then... ...thank you for extending your hospitality. Oh, not at all. Thank you for being understanding. Oh. And, you definitely have to keep it a secret from the school. Huh? You don't have to clean! Okay. And don't touch anything. Okay. Is this really alright? You don't cook, Akiyama-sensei? Just spit it out. Is it okay to lie? It's an eggplant. What happened to your fingers? Is this your friend? I'm Harada Hiroyuki. Why are you talking like we're strangers? We don't have that kind of relationship. Let's try. Timing and Translation by sayochama QC by sarujin GIRIGIRI FANSUBS NOT FOR SALE OR RENT This is a workplace! Let's try to do something for them.
