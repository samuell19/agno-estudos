( Cat yelling... ) Rancid: Step right up for Parents' Day. ( cash register rings ) You must be accompanied by a parent. 20 bucks to share in the joy and majesty of Parents' Day. Dog: Happy Parents' Day! Dog: Whoo! Parents' Day! Oh, look how much fun they're having, Cat. Playing leap-parent... Pin the child on the parent.... Hot potato parent... Ah, isn't Parents' Day magical? ( crying ) Make it stop! Isn't this great, kiddo?! Your first roller-coaster ride! But I'm scared! Of course you are, sweetie. That's what makes roller coasters so much fun. ( all screaming... ) Cliff: Hey, CatDog! Why don't you come on in and join the fun? Ooh, I forgot, you ain't got no parents. ( all laughing... ) We do too have parents! You'll see. Thank you, keep the line moving... come on... Hello. Hello, nice to see you. ( bird chirps ) ( alarm buzzes ) ( siren wailing... ) ( bell dings ) ( bird squawks ) Duh, I love Parrots' Day, heh-heh. Not Parrots' Day, you simpleton. It's Parents' Day, as in the people who raised you fed you, took care of you and made you what you are today. Duh, right-- parrots. This explains so much. Now go on, shoo! You're holding up the line.

Kid: It's so good to have parents. ( laughs ) Dog: Ah, isn't Parents' Day magical? Cat: Yeah. Now, if we could only make it disappear. Remember how we used to curl up on Mom's nose and Dad would sing us to sleep? Rock-a-bye CatDog, on Mommy's nose... ( burps ) ♪ With two tiny heads and four sets of toes. ♪ ( burps ) The only thing I remember is that we're on our own and we always have been. This is the day, Cat-- the day we finally reunite with our long-lost parents. Dog, they're not long-lost. They're long gone. Attention CatDog's parents. Hello, 10-4. Please report to CatDog. I'm announcing! Paging Mom and Dad. We're not going anywhere, we'll be here until further notice. Come get us! Why do you embarrass us like this every year? Don't you get it? Our parents aren't coming. Not today, not tomorrow. What about the day after tomorrow? Not ever! Lube: Hey! Hey...! ( groaning ) Cat: Oh, I'm not having fun. ( groaning continues ) Duh, has anyone seen my parrots? ( Dog grunting ) Don't be disappointed, Cat. There's always next year. Hmm... ( growling impatiently ) Ding-ding. ( Cat screaming ) ( crashing and beeping ) ( Cat groaning ) I hate this room. Oh, I feel a lot of love in my parents theory room. Love, love, love. Mm-hmm. Love? ( scoffs ) If our parents love us so much why haven't they tried to find us? Ah, but Cat... they are trying to find us. But they're being stopped by mysterious forces beyond they're control. For example, theory number 47: Mom and Dad were looking for us at the North Pole and got frozen in an icy iceberg. Or theory number 119: Mom and Dad are stranded on a deserted island inhabited by rabid weasels. ( weasels barking and growling ) Or theory number 78: Mom and Dad are trapped in a revolving door. ( gasps ) But Dog, you're forgetting theory numero uno! I am? What is theory numbero uno? Our parents haven't found us yet because... they're not looking for us! Then we shall be looking for them. We are not going to waste our time looking for parents who obviously don't care about us and that's final! Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I haven't lost hope. ( snoring and mumbling... ) Mom... Dad... Mom, hi. We turned out pretty good, huh? ( snoring and whimpering ) ( sighs ) Well, who knows? May be they are out there looking for us. ( groans ) Who am I trying to kid? Dog: Mom... Dad... Dad... Mom... Coming up next on the Whitefish Chub Channel Chub Chat, with your host Chet Chubberton. ( barking and laughing ) Dog, do you mind? ( Winslow laughing ) No, he don't mind at all. ( laughs ) He can do this for hours. And so could I. ( laughs ) Nothing like quality time with my CatDog. ( rumbling ) What, what is that? Winslow: Hey, hey... Eek... This is Randolph, your roving reporter coming to you live from the far regions of Yonder Land where the giant whirlywind geyser Old Uppenchuck is due to erupt within the next 24 hours. Ooh, a sneak preview... and I love it! And his dad loves it, too. Jeez-Louise, the last time Old Uppenchuck blew was around the same time youse two showed up. Ah, seems like yesterday. Hey, nice shoes, funny boy. Ah, too easy, I need a challenge. ( rumbling ) Whoa... ( screams ) ( wailing ) Whoa! Sheesh... look at that. A cute dog attached to an ugly, disgusting cat. ( laughing ) Thank you... That was the best day of my life. Why didn't you tell us this before? You never asked me. ( laughs ) If that's true, then we must come from Yonder Land. Which means our parents might be... Parents? Don't even think about it, Dog. Think about what? We're not going. Going where? Don't say it, Dog. Say what? Don't say, "We're going to Yonder Land to look for our parents?". We're going to Yonder Land to look for our parents? Oh, all right, we'll go. But I'm only doing this for you, now stop hounding me. Hi-ho diggity! Cat, are we there yet? Are we there? Are we there yet? Now are we there? Yes, oh, yes, Dog, we're there, we are so there. Yonder Land has always been right next door. I can hardly wait to see Mom's smiling eyes and Dad's slimy green skin again. Now pay attention. This is map of Yonder Land. We are here. Old Uppenchuck is here. Now, according to my calculations we should arrive there at exactly 11:35 tomorrow morning. Maybe we can stop and buy a present... No, Dog, no, no, no. No stops, no presents, no detours. We're going straight through. Dog: "You are now leaving Nearburg." Hmm, good-bye, Nearburg. Cat? Yes, Dog? Are we there yet? ( disco music playing ) ♪ La-la-la, no CatDog in the house ♪ ♪ I'm here in my favorite house, me ♪ ♪ Got the place all to myself ♪ La, la, la, la, la-la-la ♪ La, la, la... Hey, CatDog! We got a special delivery thrashing for you! Poundage due! I... ooh... ( music continues ) Ta-da! ( grumbling ) Don't you jokers ever knock? Duh, I think next time we should. If you're looking for CatDog, they ain't here. They're looking for their parents in Yonder Land. Huh? Well, if we can find CatDog we can pound them and their lousy parents. ( all laughing ) I wouldn't mind meeting Dog's parents... Hmm? So, so... so I could pound them, too! Cliff: Pound the whole family tree! ( Greasers laughing ) Ah! Time for a little tanning. ♪ I'm so pretty ♪ Tanning pretty ♪ Pretty and tan... ( tires squealing ) ( excited panting ) Hello, Son. Hiya, Cat, old boy. ( gasps ) What the... Oh, look, Cat... it's Mommy and Daddy. Dog, what are you doing? I can't see the road. Sorry, Cat. Oh, hello, Mommy and Daddy. I missed you so much. We missed you, too. Oh, you haven't changed a bit, Dog. ( laughs ) Still as cute as a button. Oh, and look over there-- it's Cat. Dog! Do you mind?! I'm trying to drive here! Oh, do you boys want to get some ice cream? Ice cream, ice cream, I want ice cream! No, no, Cat's palate is far too discerning. He'd prefer tuna mousse or a whitefish scone. Why, thank you very much, Father. Finally someone in this family who understands my sophisticated pal... ( growls ) I'm talking to a sock! Dog, get those stinking socks out of my face! ( truck horn honks ) ( screams ) It's okay, Mommy and Daddy. We can still have ice cream. Oh, you Mom and Dad, you're incorrigible. Dog! ( whispering... ) Cat: Why didn't you do that before we left? ( toilet flushing ) So that's how those rascals do it. Oh, that's got to hurt. I found it riveting. I hate public restrooms. Mmm, but the mints are good. That's not a mint! Oh, we've wasted enough time here. We've need to get back on the schedule. Terrific... a freak parade. Let's get out of here, Dog. Stay close. Hey, you're going the wrong way, man. The mother ship is this way. The aliens are bringing back everyone they've ever abducted. Cat! It's theory 421: Mom and Dad were abducted by aliens and forced to build lunar igloos out of bars of intergalactic soap. Oh, Dog, don't start. I told you no detours, no sto... Hey, ow, ow... Dog: Mother ship, here we come! Cat: Somebody... stop... Dog: Hi-ho diggity! Cat: Dog, this is not on the itinerary. Besides, there's no such thing as... ( zapping and beeping... ) ( all gasp ) ( all gasp ) ( slurping ) ( gulps ) ( bland instrumental music playing ) ( buzzer sounding ) ( all exclaim ) Male airline pilot-like voice: Uh, welcome back to Earth. Please exit the craft in an orderly manner and thank you for choosing us for your alien abduction needs. Daddy! Daddy! There's Grandma! Ah, there's my lovin' mama! How was space? Oh my gosh, I missed you so much. How was it? Did they feed you? Are you all right? Dog: Yoo-hoo, over here. Mom and Dada CatDog. Cat, do you see Mom and Dad? Huh, do you, do you? Uh, I don't know why we keep coming to earth. We never find anything unusual. I told you we're wasting our time. Maybe they're still inside watching the end of the in-flight movie. Or having trouble with their seat belts. Cat: Aah...! Open up! Help! Let us out of here! Dog, we're trapped! ( gasps ) ( slurping... ) ( laughs ) Oh, that was close. Maybe they know where Mom and Dad are. No, Dog, they'll see us! Whoa, go, go...! ( Cat yelling... ) Mom! Dad! Your little prides and joys are here. Your cute progenies. ( whimpering ) This place is giving me the creeps. ( screams ) What, what?! Hello, Mom, Dad. Where are you? Oh, parents? Parents... ( Cat groaning and gibbering... ) Gee, Cat, why are you playing around with the extra-ter-alien spaceman stuff? We're supposed to be looking for our parents. I am not playing around, you ninny. Alien: There's the intruders. Capture them! Run, Dog, run! ( panting and whimpering... ) Surrender, Earth creatures. Resistance is fuble, fugle... a waste of time. Get them. Do something, Dog. What are you doing? I'm doing something. No, no, Dog. Do something, something! Uh... Whoa! Whoa... ( beeping ) ( whimpering ) ( Cat and Dog yelling ) ( both groaning ) Um... ( all yelling... ) Give me that, you ninny! ( growling ) Zoom... zoom! Uh, this doesn't look good, Tim. You're right, Tim, all is lost. We must abandon ship. Uh... to the escape pods! Hey, Cat, looks like your parents search is having a few ups and downs. ( laughs ) Winslow, thank goodness! We need your help! Don't listen to them, little blue friend. It's an Earth creature trick. Don't worry, you'll be safe with us. What are you, nuts? ( Winslow screams ) Aah... ( both grunting and groaning ) ( groaning ) Cliff: CatDog? ( tires squeal, crash ) Where are the brakes on this thing? ( Dog grunting ) Cat: Terrific. You just had to get on the ship, didn't you? Oh, Cat, look at the little fish. Hello, little fishy. Forget about the stupid fish. Get out of here, you little pipsqueak. Huh? ( screams ) ( roaring ) ( both scream ) ( electrical crackling ) ( both whimpering ) What is that thing? It's horrible! Cat, it's theory number 37! Aah! Mom and Dad got swallowed by Bessie, the mysterious lake monster. We're about to be eaten by theory 37! Oh, great idea, Cat. Mom and Dad, here we come. ( whirring ) Cat: No! Dog: Whoa! Open wide, Bessie. ( gurgling yell ) Wrong way, wrong way! ( snarls ) We're about to be swallowed! Whoa... Duh... Huh? Dog: This reminds me of how Dad used to bounce us around on his tongue. Duh! Ow, duh... This finally explains why Catdog are so freaky-looking. Those guys are space aliens from another planet. We're on another planet? I wish I had a camera. Oh, I always knew that pooch was out of this world. Through the lips and over the gums! Fear not, Mom and Dad, here we comes! ( screaming... ) ( Cat groaning, Dog laughing ) Belly slide to the belly! Hi-ho, Mom and Dad! ( Cat groaning ) Why me...? Dog: Why not...? Why not? ( coughing and spitting ) Wow... The majestic abdominal cavity of Bessie the mysterious lake monster. Spacious, yet homey. Mom? Dad? We're here to rescue you from theory number 37 and take you home! Huh? Hmm? Aha! I think I hear something. ( rumbling, squirting loudly ) ( growls ) Dog... ( sputtering ) Huh? Mom? Dad? Oh, there you are! I have found you at last. Uh, sorry, Cat. ( coughing and spitting ) This goes right to the top of my list of the worst things that have ever happened to me. ( coughing ) Hmm... I guess they aren't here. Hey, Cat, it's like a big bubble bath. Whoa! ( laughing ) ( sizzling ) It's not a bubble bath. Dog, we're being digested! It that bad? Both: Aah! ( both yelling ) Both: Aah...! ( sizzling ) ( Cat whimpering... ) Mom? Dad? And on the starboard side you will see Catdog in a demonstration of the digestion process! ( laughs ) Winslow, you got to get us out of here. Sorry, the tour is full. Why don't you try going out the back door? ( laughs ) What the... Winslow: Aah! Help, Mommy! Cat, how are we going to get out of here? ( retching ) Hairball! No, had one for breakfast. No, no, no. We can make a giant hairball, get inside and Bessie will hack us out to freedom. Start shedding! Grr... Anchors away! Hmm? Come on, Dog. Let's do it. ( both grunting... ) ( gags ) ( retching ) Lube: Duh... I hereby dub this planet, uh... Planet. Whoa...! ( gagging ) ( retching ) ( spits ) ( Cat screaming ) Hey, look... it's a shooting hairball. Uh, make a wish. Hey, that hairball's got CatDog inside. Let us pursue them with vigor! Cat: Whoa...! Cliff: Vigor! Reminds me how Mom used to wrap us up in hairballs and throw us in the air. Enough of your silly memories! How are we going to land this thing?! ( roaring ) She's... she's breaking up! She's bre... ( garbled ) ( screams ) Whoa, oh... Ouch! ( laughing ) Oh, that was fun! Are you okay, Cat? No, I'm not okay. I just landed on a very sharp rock and... Aah...! Dog: Mm-hmm... ( sniffing ) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm... Yeah, I got something. Yes... uh-huh... Effluvium... Mm-hmm... ( sniffing ) Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm... ( sniffing... ) Yes, yes... ( sniffing... ) No, no... oh. ( sniffing ) Dog, get away from there! You don't know what that is! Sure I do, Cat. It's theory number 2,001. Our parents fell down a tree hole and were captured by a tribe of evil mutant wood-nymphs. Well, I guess I was wrong. Nothing in there but red-hot Peruvian fire ants. ( Cat screaming ) Ow, ow, ow...! Okay, Dog, that's it! No more spaceships. No more lake monsters. No more evil mutant fire ants! We are going straight to Yonder Land. Do you understand? Okay, Cat. Stop it! We're going! Got ya. Promise me, Dog, no matter what. No more silly side trips. No ridiculous detours. I promise. Fine. Onward. Next stop Yonder Land. Yonder Land here we come. We are on the road to Yo... What's this? "Welcome to Yokelburg. "The home of happy cats and dogs living together in peace for 50 years!" Dog, look at this. Read it yourself, Bro. I'm making for Yonder Land. No, no, Dog, stop, this is amazing. Cat said no stops. No amazing detours. No matter what! Forget what I said... Stop! Whoa... Whoa...! ( gasps ) What is it, Cat? Cat: It's Yokelburg, the home of happy dogs and cats. Our parents could be here! No kidding. Let's go...! Dog: Yes, it's the only theory that makes sense. They've got to be here. Look at that, Cat. ( Cat yelling... ) ( panting ) Dog: Getting closer. ( gasps ) ( sighs ) ( voices cheering ) ( laughing ) ( burping ) ( gasp ) ( chuckling ) ( purrs ) Cat, it's the happiest place on Earth. It's... It's beyond belief. Yokelburger: Well, howdy, friend. ( laughing ) Welcome to Yokelburg. We all celebrating 50 years of peace and harmony. Yokelburg dog: You joining the festivivities? ( spits ) Well, shut my mouth and grease me up. ( in hillbilly accent ): I sure love going to want to join the whoop-si-do. ( grunts ) ( chuckling ): If you'll excuse us, uh... gentlemen we're here looking for our par... ( bell rings ) The music's starting. Music? Well, don't commence the twangings without us 'uns. Cat ( grunting ): Let them commence. I mean, co... Cat: Please, I don't do-si-do, remember? ( crowd cheering ) Cat, do you see a mom and dad catdog?

What an absolutely splendid day. Right you are, Darling. Mother: Perfect in every way. Dog: And they got hit on the head by a big old jaw-rattling tree. ( father grunts ) Dog: And gosh darn it. When they woke, they thought they was country singers. Yee-haw. That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. But I have to admit the eyes don't lie. I always thought they'd be rich, though. At least upper-middle-class. ( sighs ) I guess hillbilly parents are better than none. ( all spit ) How do I look? Are my whiskers straight? I want to make a good impression. ( chuckling ) Let's a-go tell them their babies are back. Cat: Say, we could always hit them on the head with another tree and they might think they were something else. ( giggling ) It's worth a try. ( wolf howling in distance ) ( grunts ) Next time we get swallowed, we're going out the front door. Hey, get a load of this. Cats and dogs living together?

I'll pound the dad. ( moaning ) I will pound the cake. Ooh, I hope his mother likes me. I mean, I hope she likes the pounding I give her. ( cheering ) Well, thank you, friends and neighbors. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you very much... and thank you. ( whoops ) ( whistles ) Dog: Oh, Ma, Pa! Sooey! Over here, it's us-- look! Son! Son, it's you. You've finally come back. Yes, Dad, it's me. I've found you. ( crowd cheering ) Yeah-hoo! See, Dog, I told you we'd find them. And you doubted me, Dog. Uh, no, I didn't. But I never gave up hope, like you did.

Ladies and gentlemen... this here's my boy, Lube. ( cheering ) All right. Dog, tell me he didn't run... past us. He ran past us. Tell me he's not... hugging Lube. He's hugging Lube. ( weeping ): But I was so sure it was them. Does that mean Lube is our brother? Oh, yeah. Lube is our brother, uh-huh. And he's our uncle. And she's our cousin. And he's our grandmother. Really? No, you numskull. We're not related to any of these people. Why did I let you talk me into coming to this place? I told you we wouldn't find them here. Imagine me, related to hillbillies. ( shuddering ) Okay, so much for theory 76. But there's more where that came from. Let's put them back where they came from so they'll be safe. Ooh, that tickles. Gee, Pooch, that's too bad. Yeah, too bad. We was looking forward to pulverizing you and them in a double-hitter. Cat: Well, we're sorry to disappoint you. That's the one, Pa. Him-- he burped right up in my little old face. Lube's father: Hang on a minute. Did you burp in my pretty little girl's face, boy? Well, of course I didn't. Dog: Yes, you did, I even smelled it. Dog. ( laughs ) Well, hot dog. Well, you know what that means. Oh, uh... actually, I'm unfamiliar with your quaint little customs. In these here parts, darling, if y'all burp in somebody's face that means you got marriage on your mind. ( burps ) Aw, gee, Cat. I didn't know y'all wanted to get married. I sure do wish our parents was here. ( gasps ) Get married? ( echoing ): Get married? They's a-going to be a wedding. Now you gone and did it. Hey, Brown Eyes, maybe this could be a double wedding. That's a great idea, Shriek. Hey, who wants to marry Shriek? I will. Marry me. I'll take her. I'll split her with you. ( growling and roaring ) ( giggling ): Aren't you as happy as me, Honey Pie? ( giggling ) ( gasps ) Let the hitching begin. Yee-haw. ( Cat moaning ) ( shrieking ) ( panting ) ( grunts ) Cliff: Psst. Hey, Cat. Give her a big smooch for me. ( laughing ) ( makes kissing noises ) ( Cliff laughing ) Ahh, that reminds me of Dad. He didn't have any teeth, either. Minister: Is there's anybody here who knows a reason why these here critters should not be hitching? Dog. Nope, can't think of a thing. Dog! All righty, then. That's good enough for me. I now pronounce you cat and... Winslow: Wait a minute! I know why these two can't get married. Oh, thank you. Winslow, I love you. They ain't got no ring. That little blue fellow's right. Yokelburger: Can't get hitched without a ring. ( chuckles ): Well, can't have a wedding without a ring. That's what I... always say. Maybe some other time. Besides, we all need to get back on that parent search. Winslow: However, I just happen to have a few rings right here. I'll take this one. Nice choice. Winslow: Don't worry, Cat. I'll bill you. ( cackles "Here Comes the Bride" ) ( growls ) ( cheering ) Winslow saved the wedding. Well, all right, Winslow. Dog, you yapping flea bag. I don't want to get married, especially to some lousy dog. ( crowd gasps ) Hey, Cat. I'm a lousy dog. Exactly. And that's why I'm in this mess. Well, ain't that just like a finicky, fishing fur-licking feline? It sure is. Well, at least we clean ourselves. Hear, hear-- good point. Are you a-saying we're dirty? We don't have to say it. We can smell it. ( crowd murmuring and growling ) Yeah, dogs stink. Cats are lazy. Mangy mutt. You hairball-hackers. Well, you gosh darned cat. I'm a-restarting this here feud. ( moans ) No, you ain't, you low-down dirty dog. Because I'm a-restarting this feud.

What in tarnation?! What is it, Pa? Hairballs! ( screaming ) Look out!Look out! ( whistling ) ( yelling ) ( yelling ) ( chuckles ) Front-row seats! Ready... aim... hack! ( all hawking ) Huh? Huh? Huh? They're coming! ( crunching ) ( swallowing ) It's a little scratchy at first but it hits the spot. ( belches loudly ) Duh... save some for me.

Well, I'll be dad-blamed if the city feller ain't right. Yeah, let's quit our quibbling and a-quarreling and get to pounding us some CatDog! ( all yelling angrily ) ( creature growling ) Well, we got out of that in one piece, hey, buddy? Doggy? Old pal? ( laughs nervously ) Pardon? Oh, are you talking to me-- the lousy dog that always gets you into trouble? Now, don't be so hard on yourself, Dog. Even though everything that has happened to us was entirely your fault I... I still blame myself. Okay, Cat, I forgive you. Forgive me?! Oh, so you're blaming me now? ( laughing ) And I suppose it's my fault that we're stuck on this log in the middle of this river?! Cat, for this I forgive you also. G...! Forgive me also?! You can't...! Shh, shh, shh, shh! ( water rushing ) What? What is it? What?! ( weakly ): Waterfall. Oh, a waterfall. Well, who cares ABOUT A WATERFALL!!!! ( both yelling ) ( sputtering and shouting ) ( giant toilet flushing ) ( metallic clanging and banging ) ( voices babbling ) ( metallic clanging ) ( rumbling ) CatDog: Whoa...! ( Cat coughing dramatically ) Buddy! ( gasps ) Cat, look! It's that place we saw on the news! What?! Our parents live here. Ahh... Ahh... again. All right, now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We have to proceed in a cautious and orderly fash... Hi ho diggity! Oh, wow! Oh, Mom! Dad! Oh, Mom! Dad! We're here! We're here!(yipping excitedly) Come out, come out, wherever you are! Mommy and Daddy! Ow! Stop it! Please! Please! ( screeching ) "Old Uppenchuck." Ah, we've stopped. Good! Look, look, Cat! I bet they're waiting for us right behind those rocks with a big "Welcome Home" party with ice cream cake and balloon animals and "pin-the-tail- on-the-Mama-Papa" and mimes! What are you talk... Hi, ho, mimes! What are you talking...?! Mom and Dad, yay, yay! Mom, Dad...! Ta-dah! Your boys are finally... here. ( disappointedly ): Oh... Cat, they're not here. For once, I think you're right. Cat... Oh, let me guess. It's on to theory number 6 billion and 52. No. Well, no more theories, dog. Okay. Don't argue with me! I won't. Looking for our parents was a dumb idea. Right. Let's just go home. Go home?! Did you say "go home"? But, but, but, but... what about the rest of your theories? Theories, theories. My theories are stupid. Don't say that, dog. No! I mean, well, they aren't all stupid. Here, like this one, for example with the Jell-O and the flamingo... flamingo dancers? Okay, maybe not that one but I'm sure there's something here. Here, let's find one. Cat, forget it. I don't want to look anymore. You mean quit? You can't quit! I'm the quitter. I know. I wish I was more like you. No, you don't. The truth is... I wish I was more like you. ( growls ) I wish I had your dogged determination to chase after something you believe in. Oh, like garbage trucks? No, Dog. I'm talking about... our parents. You never gave up hope that they were out there and that they do care about us. Until now. But I won't let you give up. Now, we... we may not find them today; we may not find them tomorrow or the next day... What about the day after the next day? Any day, dog... it doesn't matter. The point is, someday we are going to find them... But no matter what, we are brothers and we'll always have each other. ( sniveling ) Oh, cat! Come here, you! ( whining and moaning ) But... let's just keep this little moment of sappiness to ourselves, okay? ( loud rumbling ) Sounds like this place is getting ready to blow. Let's get out of here. Right behind you, brother who I'll always have no matter what. Today, tomorrow, the next day the day after the next day! ( panting ) ( screaming ) Cat: Help, help, help! Stop it! Let us go, let us go! At least, let me go. Oh, please, let any dogs out first! Help! Do something, Dog. Sic him, sic him, sic him. ( sweetly ): Hi-ho diggity! Mommy, Daddy! I finally found my boys. Oh, what's for dinner? Are you insane? It's got four eyes! Male voice: Well, actually two of them are mine. ( gasps ) Slimy, green skin. Frog: Oh, so I suppose you're too grown up now to give your old man a hug, huh? Dog: I'm not, Dad. Mom's four eyes... Dad's slimy green skin. Wait a minute! You're our parents? but you're a... and you, you're a... not a CatDog. Dad: Nothing gets past you, does it, genius? We found you when you were just a little baby CatDog right out on that ledge. Then you're not our parents? Dad: Well, let's see... we raised you, fed you, loved you and made you who you are today. Dog: Oh, that sounds like parents to me, Cat. Then where did we come from? Well, dear, we really don't know. Heck, we don't know where your mother came from, either but that doesn't matter because she's your mother and you're our boys. And you always have been. Mom: Those were such happy times. ( baby CatDog squawking ) Dad: Okay uh... let's see... Oh, forget it. Dad: ♪ Rock-a-bye, CatDog, on top of mommy's nose. ♪ ♪ Two tiny heads, and four sets of toes... ♪ Whee! Whee! ( laughing ) Mom: And then came that horrible day... ( rumbling ) ( screaming ) Hang on, baby cakes. ( gagging ) Hold on, hold on. ( screaming ) ( echoing ): No! And we've been searching all over the world for you boys ever since. See, Cat, I told you. But the strangest things kept happening to us. We was frozen in an Arctic glacier; marooned on an island of rabid weasels; abducted by aliens; swallowed by a giant lake monster; captured by a tribe of evil mutant wood nymphs; and we even thought we was country and western singers for a while. ♪ Oh, we used to fuss and fight ♪ ♪ but ain't no more Both: ♪ We used to scratch and fight, but ain't no more. ♪ I'm going to scratch you.

Oh, CatDog, I found you-- what the... ( screams ) A little help here. Dog: Winslow, we'd like you to meet our mom and dad. Pleased to meet you. Charmed, I am sure. Your parents? You mean, youse actually found them? ( sarcastically ): That's just great! Now I suppose you're going to be one big, happy family living in your cozy little cave. What about me? What about Winslow? My life is nothing without a CatDog to harass. Don't worry, Winslow you can move in with us. What are you, nuts? Me live in a stinkin' cave? I don't need CatDog that bad. I'm out of here. Oh, and by the way, I found some friends of yours that were looking for youse. See you! ( cackling ) Lookee what we found here. Now you're all going to pay for starting us to feuding and wrecking our town. Yeah, yeah! ( all grumbling ) Yeah, and where's your parents? I been waitin' a long time to meet them. Mom: Boys, aren't you going to introduce us to your little friends? ( stuttering ) ( screaming ) Dog: Hey, everybody, this is our mom and dad. Hello. Dad: Hiya. I wish that someday I too will be reunited with my parents. My goodness gracious at the ignorance. Hello, Mrs. CatDog. I'm Shriek, but I suppose Dog's already told you all about me. No, never mentioned you. What are you waiting for?! Let's pound them. Yeah, we got them outnumbered. Mom: Oh, my. ( gasps ) ( Cliff laughing evilly ) Looks like youse got nowhere to go. Lube: Yeah, you're at the end of the finish. Dad: Come on, you want a piece of me? Don't worry, Mom and Dad we'll protect you. We sure will. Go get them, Dog. I'll wait here. Good boy. ( Dog snarling ) ( rumbling ) Trapped like a family of rats. Mom: Oh, what do we do now? Yeah, what are you going to do now? I think I know. All right, everybody hold on. All right! What a guy won't do for his family. That about wraps it up, folks. ( gasping ) ( roaring ) Cat: Well, Dog, there's one thing that's apparent.
