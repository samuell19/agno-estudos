Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Come on, baby! Come on, baby! Come on...! Barbara, honey, are you awake? Barbara? Hi. I just wanted to see if youknew what you were going to wear today. I still need to run today. Well, maybe if you'd gotten up earlier. You know, you'll get there if you're putting in the work. But, I've been watching you and... I don't know. You tell me. Do you think you've been putting in the work? Something to think about. You need to be prepared. Blacking out like last time... You could really get hurt. Look, I know I push you, but Whatever happens from here on out, I know that you're going to be OK. Yeah? Why's that? Because you're like me. You're up early. You can thank your father for that. And Beverly. I don't have any control over my father's libido. Sometimes I wonder who's havingmore sex these days. Your father or our daughter. - Can you not talk about Barbaralike that, please? - I wish I could talk about Leslie like that. Why don't you just stop talking altogether? You want coffee? Constance, please. The kids are sleeping. And dad's busy with his girlfriend... OK, that's exactly why I'm not in the mood, OK? If we get quiet Ié\'92m gonna have to hear them again.é\ Jesus, Gregg. Not to mention I have a goddamned Thanksgiving meal to prepare for the entire family. Your idiot brother and his son are gonna be here any minute, and just... See if you can control yourself for the rest of the day. I don't have time for... fucking. Gregg, you're the only man I'veever known who's a fucking ice queen. That's my girl! - I hate uncle Gregg's cooking!- Bobby Jon, you ungrateful little punk! 'Destination is 20 miles away.' You see this colored man over here? He don't have a meal to go to. - He's got all the time in the world to wait. - Dad what are you doing? - I bet he'd love uncle Gregg'scooking. - Dad, stop that. Dad... - Dad, panhandling is illegal. Don't encourage him. - Bobby Jon, it's Thanksgiving and you're not thankful. So I'm gonna give to someone who is. 'Destination is 10 miles away.' Leslie, grandpa Frank here! Leslie, I have to make a BM! Leslie, cut that damn thing off! So, uh... Dad said you were setting the table? These houses just went on the market last week, And my inbox is already... Really, mom?! That is, uh, really exciting. Barbara, just set the frigginé\' table. You! Help your sister- - I don't need his help. - I'm busy. Busy doing what? Trying to make your grandfather soil himself? How was I supposed to know Beverly was using the other bathroom? God forbid I'd be clean. - Yeah, if only you looked it. - Fuck off, Barbara! Leslie! Maybe, if I had a mental breakdown, I'd get away with everything too! I swear to god, Leslie, I'm going to ream you a new one! - You'd never say that to her!Never! She always gets away withshit! - Goddammit, Leslie! What did you say? Why does everyone makes me out to be the problem?! Because you are always the problem! Enough of this. Find something productive to do. From a man who doesn't even have a job? Get out of my face. Now. Beverly, you don't have to do that. Not a hassle at all. And you have enough on your plate as it is. That's my girl! - Gregg! - I would like to spend today with each other and no one else. No phones, no pads, no pods, none of that, OK? Your work will be here for you tomorrow. - In fact, I'm taking all of theelectronic devices. - Here, Gregg. Take mine as well. Francis? Well, I don't mean to offend you, Gregg, but I'm gonna hang on to my beeper. One thing I've learned after about 40 years in the gynecology game Is that emergencies happen and I'm not gonna allow my patients to not be able to contact me. Even for you, buddy. Fantastic. Nervous, sweetheart? I'm sorry about your brother. Iknow he can be difficult, but he's... He's at an age. I know you think no one knows what you're going through. But we love you very much and we just want what's best for you. What do you say tomorrow we go for a run, just the two of us? We can talk about whatever you want. It's your call. I love you, sweetheart. It's a new play, very modern. What was it called again, Bev? - The Bail-Bondsman. - Oh yeah. Very modern, very good. Too bad Bev had to go to the bathroom during some vital plot points. I'll never have Thai food before- We learned never to have dinner before the theater. But it was very good, very modern. Honey, I think that's my drink in front of the seat you're in. With Hank Duffy's son, Tom. Youknow him? He's the theater director. And we had us a delicious, what was it called, Bev? Tiara-miso. Whatever is was called, it was delicious. - Too bad Bev couldn't have a bite. - I'm diabetic. Yeah, but it was rich. Very rich, and very delicious. You know, you oughta talk to Tom. He might have an opening at his theater. I'm a theater director, Frank. What's he gonna do, give me his job? You were a theater director, Gregg. It's time to ship up or shape out. Where's Barbara? Everybody in this fucking familyis just trying to kick my dick in! Kick your what? Leslie, I assure you, I'm not trying- I said in the family! What is wrong with your brain, boy? Now, I don't know what's wrong with your brain, but there is definitely something wrong with your brain. So, tell me. What's wrong with your brain? Your sister's been upstairs for an hour crying in the shower. - Don't you have any consideration for other people? - How is that my fault? Leslie, you've been a miserablecad since you woke up this morning. You're gonna stop it now, or there are gonna be serious consequences. Now, ship up, shape up! It's time to ship up or shape out! I've got this, Frank! Oh, you've got this alright. Your son here wants somebody to tickle his dick, Your daughter's upstairs bawlingher eyes out and running up the water bill. Frank, why don't you let me worry about my own water bill. Hey, if it's your water bill, you should be the one to pay it. Dad! - Oh my, now, Francis... - That was wrong. I'm sorry. Just stuff a turkey leg in it, OK? Thank God, we have to pretend to be civil human beings again. No, no, no. Sit. I'll get it, you sit. You've been on your feet enough today And you... behave. Hey, give little Frankie a kissfrom his daddy, for me, would you, Bev? Dad, you can kiss him yourself. Patience, now, I'm coming. Your daughter's gonna have to start paying for all this broken glass. Bev? Beverly? Bev! Dad, the door! No, no, stop! Look out! Scream and I'll feed you your eyeball. Oh, Christ! Don't say peep or I'll blow your teeth out. Where's Bobby Jon?! What did you do to Frank Jr.?! That goes for you too, you old sack of shit! Ah hell, I don't know. Forrest, what you do to those ol' boys? Oh, they were real nice, Cap. I still got the c-note that they gave me. Gimme that! We share everything! You know that. Get the fuck out of my house. Your house? This isn't your house. First of all! Everybody shut the fuck up! Second, this is my house! I carved it outta the bones of 40 chinamen in Cambodia. And I'm about to paint it in your blood. Your house?! You've got to be fucking with me, lady! We got the guns, bitch! My house. This is my house! You'll be the dog that licks thescraps off my boots if you're lucky. Got it? You're all going do exactly what we say or else. Or else we will stab you. We will shoot you. We will torture you. We will kill you. Turk will do far worse if we let him. And much, much worse if I ask him. Fair deal? When I ask a question somebody better fucking answer it. And seeing as you're the man of the house, Weasly-looking piece of shit you are... I'm holding you responsible. Now, I asked you... If you thought I offered a fair deal or not. Did I? Or didn't I? You did. I did? Good. I like to consider myself a fair man. Alright, Forrest, Sal, tie 'em up. Tie 'em up good and tight! Let's settle the fuck in for dinner. Wait... We ain't wearing our Sunday Finest. Well, if we're gonna dress up. I wanna dress up my date. If Sal gets a date, I want a date too. This one's just a little bitch! I want a man. A young, strong man. You look like the kinda guy that fucks on a first date. Well, are ya? Uh... Yeah, I guess. - These clothes aren't worth shit. - Jackpot! Speak for yourself. I ain't never own no tie before. Hey Cap, can you help me with this thing? OK, come here. Look straight ahead, dammit, Forrest. - Hey, Cap. - Yeah. How long we planning on staying here? Well, let's eat... Through next morning and we'll see what happens with the storm. We gotta... - Wait it out. - Yeah, yeah. We might as well enjoy Thanksgiving. Come on, get it there! Come on! Move it! I hear they give out turkey in prison. Say man, what's got you spooked? You think I'm gonna get you caught?! It ain't like that, Cap. It's just these people. These people? Yeah, these people. I get nervous when I'm around them. They make me anxious. I just. Wait, wait... Are you scared? Being around them makes me sick to my stomach. I get a bad feeling. What the fuck is a Hump Pump? Come on, now! Time to eat, I'm starving! Oh, calm down. I'm coming, you old fuck. Get in there! Hey, fucknut! Cap says it's time to eat! Listen to me, old buddy. We are gonna be the ones that survive this fucking storm. That's a promise. Champloo-Champlee! Oh, they got the good stuff around here! I do love a celebration! Turk, we gotta give you some. - Wasted. - Oh, yeah. No, no! Break it. Gimme, gimme, gimme. - Yeah! - Where are your damn manners? Sit your ass down. Sit down! Alright, a toast! To peach porridge and agent orange! Praise the Lord! You drink? Sometimes. That wasn't a question. This shit's yours, right? See, we found this up in the bathroom. And you're the only bitch here that smells like shampoo. You want some, don't you? You want it. You want it. You want it bad. Come on, smell it. Smell this. Smell it! Ah, you know. We used to transport this stuff back from the jungle in body bags. So, chances are, that nose candyhas been up in somebody's gizzards. Hey, Turk. Turk! Turk, Turk, Turk, Turk, Turk! Forrest! I don't want you starting shit. Sal's not gonna like that. Cap, Bear Boy's a free man. He can do as he pleases. Get the fuck off me, Turk! Get that rope, man! Move! Move, damn it! He's good! He's good now! For now. Maybe if we didn't have this asshole riling him up! Whatever. You know, you've been fucking up a lot lately. And what did happen to Mooney, anyway? I already told you, the cops got him. I've seen Mooney lose the cops a million times. That's enough, Sal. What you tryin' to say, Sal? All I'm sayin'... I said it's enough! All I'm saying is you better watch your fucking back because if I you look at him wrong again I'm gonna slit your fucking throat. Remember the meal we ate at the judge's? That was some good eatin'. This is alright. Oh, Gregg. When I was a little boy, we used to go around the table and we all say what we was thankful for. Right. Y'all do that? Guess not. Well, then I'll start. I'm thankful... For the motherfucker who gave mea c-note before I killed his ass. Booby Joon! His name... Is Bobby Jon. Is that right? That's funny. See, cuz I could've sworn he said that his name was... Booby Joon. What did you say his name was again? Please, tell me because... I can't remember. What was his name? Booby Joon. Well, I'm glad we on the same page now. So, what it is you thankful for, geezer. He doesn't have much to be thankful for, does he? You killed his grandson, You killed his son, His... His girlfriend! That was your bitch? This old bastard's a player! Is that how you people get off? Torturing an old man?! Torturing a family?! Gregg... Why don't you shut the fuck up? Yeah, Gregory... Why don't you listen to your wife? My name is Gregg. And my name is Death! And I'm willing to bring the hammer down on you. Your... children, and that old prize sow of yours. I don't know, lady. I'm starting to experience some Cambodia flashbacks. Cuz this husband o' yours sure is yellow. Who the fuck do you think you are? Coming in here and talking to me like that? Talk to my wife like that? You think you're so smart. You have us all at your mercy. But you don't have nothing. Nothing. So, you come in here and you take from good decent people. Meanwhile, you're nothing but a bunch of deadbeats! Shit, shit, shit, shit! Damn it! God dammit! Cooze is loose! Damn it! God dammit! Cooze is loose! Damn it! God dammit! Cooze is loose! Hey! Well, well, look at that. Turk. Watch it. Look, look. When did they start making Barbie life-size dream homes? Gimme this! Fucking beeper! Why do you even need that fucking thing? I am a doctor. OBGYN. You're a pussy doctor? I think I just fed his phone to Turk. What the fuck is going on here? Is that your dick between those? Uh... yeah... It is. Jesus, Leslie. Fucking liar, that ain't you. That is daddy's dick right there. Oh, oh, oh! But it ain't momma's titties! Oh, shit! Boys, we got dinner and a movie! Look at that. Bullshit! How the fuck did you get a piece of ass like that?! Don't get it wet. Oh, oh she's young. She's young! Morgan. Morgan says: 'Gregg...' 'I miss you.' 'Wish we could spend Thanksgiving together.' And there's a smiley face on it! And-And then Gregg... Gregg says: 'I do too.' 'Maybe I can see you after mother goes to bed.' Well... I'd say mother's gone to bed! She is not Gregg's mother! God's sake... Gregg... Your mother has been dead for 15 years. I thought we were the assholes.Lady, you crapped out with this one. It's not what it sounds like. I can explain. - I know what it sounds like, but it's not. - You shit hound. You great shit hound. It's not what you think. Sorry... Oh, I love the movies! Look at me! Look at me, Constance! Look at me, Constance! Kill them all! Kill them all! KILL THEM ALL! Constance... Constance! Mom? I think we broke it. I need to use the bathroom. I need to use the facilities in this house. Grant me the dignity of not messing myself, please. The old man's gonna shit himself. Forrest, can you please get him out of here? Why I gotta do it? Cuz you're the one closest to him, you lazy-ass! I don't give a damn! He can shit himself for all I care! I used to eat all the time next to shit bags in Cambodia. Please... Please... OK... Tell you what, old man. I... Will allow you... to not shit yourself... Under the condition... That the gentleman's mistress... Arrives. Until then... I'm gonna have Forrest... Break your fingers... One at a time... Until she shows up. Forrest, would it be too much for me to ask you to break his fingers? Oh, Cap'n, hell no! No! That is one down... And nine to go. 'Hey you, you all done already?' Hey, baby. We're all done over here. 'Yay! I'm sorry you've been stuck there all day.' 'Must've been torture.' 'But, um, how's your mom doing?' 'She feeling any better?' I need you to... I need you to come over, Morgan. 'Why, did something happen?' She died today. - 'Oh, my God, Gregg.' - My mother, she... she died. 'I'm so sorry. Are you OK?' I-I need you to c-I need you to come over. I wouldn't ask under any other circumstance. But, I need-I need your help. Can you-can you come over? 'Of course, yes. I'm leaving right now.' 'Everything's gonna be OK.' I hope so. Please... uh, just as fast as you can. I told you to hurry up! We were getting down to the wire there for a minute. Frankie was starting to slip away before we were finished. Happy Thanksgiving! Finger food? Let's take a look! Oh my... Well, I'll be fucked. This is some nice piece of poon tang. How the hell did you manage this, Gregg? Probably one of his little actress sluts. I've seen the way you look at those girls. What the fuck is going on?! Who the fuck are these people?! We-We've got the table all set for you. We got some turkey, we got mashed potatoes, We've got corn, and now we've got dessert. What are you doing? Should it be peach cobbler...? Or apple pie? Why are you asking me? We should be talking to the poon authority right over here. Right, Gregory? Been busy in the kitchen, have we, Gregg? Now, we all know that you've taken the temperature on at least one of these tamales, And hell, you've been around theother one for about what? 17 years? You must have a good feel on 'em both. So, which is is, Greggy-head? Peach cobbler or apple pie? Peach cobbler or apple pie? Don't you let anything happen to our baby, you stupid sack of shit! Now, now, now. Don't listen to her. Peach cobbler or apple pie? - Peach cobbler or apple pie? - DON'T YOU DARE, YOU SACK OF SHIT! -Peach cobbler or apple pie? - Peach cobbler or apple pie? - ANYTHING HAPPENS TO OUR BABY -Peach cobbler or apple pie?

I've been waiting all day for this. My pants have been tight ever since I saw the legs on that piece downstairs. And then you come along. And here I am trying to be a good boy and behave myself! Cuz I can tell you. Babs... she might be a pretty gash, but you, baby, you're... you're a choice. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Help! I'm gonna give you something to be thankful for. Morgan's Organ. My favorite program. You know, I really wouldn't complain if I were you. You just got a better Thanksgiving meal than everyone else in this house. Batter up! RUN, BARBARA, RUN! OH, you're gonna regret this! I was hoping we'd get a chance to finish what we started. I know... I know this is hard. Things getting crazy. But tell me this isn't the mostexciting Thanksgiving you've ever had. You're a freaky kid, you know that? Freaky's good. Good men... don't have to die... Good men... don't have to die... Dad!

No, wait for Bo. I'm pretty sure she has a nice surprise in store for us all. We wait for Bo. I don't know. These people came in and they killed everybody And I don't know what's happening. I just... I came over and everybody's dead. And then we ran here. My God. The nightmare. Horrible. That's horrible. I wish I could tell you the cavalry's coming but The landlines went with the power and my cell don't work worth a shit in the storm. We got flooding blocking the roads up ahead and my car she just don't... Shit! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me ask you ladies somethin'. I call it my safety box. Now, it ain't much but I can guaran-damn-tee it's enough to take some wretched lives. Now, we might have a chance if we just all... Y'all stay here. - No. Where are you going? - Stop. Stop. I'm sorry. This is not your fault. But, I'm just really... Please, don't. Really, it's not the time for this. God, hold still. Oh, thank God, Paul. Wait... Run. Leslie... I will slit your throat, you fucking bitch! Fuck your shit! You did in Cap, you pig fuck. I'm gonna stick this up your wife's twat. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel hot. Cap is dead, cack wad! They have to pay. First... First, we must pray. Pray for this meal. Pray for our departed leader. Bow your heads. I said bow! And close your god damn eyes! Oh Lord. We humble wretches, Come to you today to give thanks. For all that we've been given. Oh shit! Good Lord. We've lost, Oh Lord. We've lost, But I pray that you give us the strength to give in return. To give bountifully. And without prejudice. To give until there's nothing left to give. Oh, fucking shit! For today, Oh Lord... None of us will go hungry. Especially this pussy-hounding motherfucker right here! Amen! Time to stuff the turkey. Hold his fucking mouth open. Bo, get us something to drink! Gonna stuff the turkey. Something to wash it down, maybe?! STUFF THAT TURKEY! Time to stuff the turkey! Stuff the turkey! Alright, no more fuck ups. - It's time for us to get our shit together. Yeah? Who elected you leader, Governor Forrest-fuck? I must've missed the polls. You want me to muscle you, Sal? Cuz I'll muscle you real fucking good. Knock it off, you shits! We got hostages, we've got two loose pooners running around, Turk's not back yet, and you twoare wasting time measuring dicks! He couldn't compete. Anyway, we all know you got the biggest dick here. All the better to stuff your mawwith to shut you the fuck up! Enough! - Now, look, I think that Cap would say- - How do you know what Cap would say?! In case you haven't noticed, Cap ain't in charge anymore. And, for that matter, neither are you and neither are you. You know what? You've got real big balls for a little rat-fucking man. Y'all better cut that shit out. You motherfucker! Alright, Sal. Oh God. Don't look at it. Don't look at him. Ruthless. If you even think about it I'll blow this sack apart! Let him go, you fucking twat! Drop your guns! All of them! You don't have to do this, honey. Just leave. I said drop 'em, or your freak is dead! I'd watch it, bitch. Honey, I'm fine. I'm fine. Do it, you sloppy shit! You bleed just like we do! Yeah. I bleed. Please! Stop! I've bled more times than I've cum, sweated, or cried. - Stop it! - What kind of time is it for this bullshit? My first memory is of blood. My brother's blood. See, my mother, she was a crazy bat. I don't even know what he did wrong. I just remember him laying on the ground. Head cracked open, shaking on the tile. You know, as they tell it, he was tryin' to protect me. What are you waiting for? Shoot him! That didn't stop her. Oh, she got after to me all the same. Wrapped that iron cord around my neck. Hung me out the window. You know, they say that it was a miracle that I survived! Shoot him, Morgan! What the fuck are you waiting for?! Just shoot him or I'll fucking shoot him! Try me, cunt! Alright, man, that's enough, let him go... A miracle! Do you think this is a miracle? Huh?! Man, if they fucking kill my brother, man, I'm gonna fucking end you, Forrest! God dammit! Enough! I don't think that this existence is a miracle! It's a curse! Please, stop... Please, please... Stop! I shouldn't be alive. No one should live like this. On the streets. Killin' people just to get by. Do you think we wanted to do this? Do you think we love it? If we love it, it's because we learned to love it! Alright, man, you've made your fucking point. Time to let the kid go! The Lord had somethin' in mind for me, keeping me alive. So he allowed me to fester! Just like he allowed you to fester. Y'all are bad people. You don't deserve nothin' but tosit at the same table as Bo, or as Sal, or even Turk! You said it yourself. We all bleed. Isn't that right, Leslie?! NO! Can someone get this...? Fuck! Get off of me! Turk? I don't know what's gotten into you lately, But later, we're gonna talk about it. Are you alright? I think... Better than Bev. Turk! Then I'm alright. Get this sonobabich off! I've had better. Fucking bitch! Look out! You know what I'm thankful for, bitch? No! Get the fuck out of my house. That's my girl.
