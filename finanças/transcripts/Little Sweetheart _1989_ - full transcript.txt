How you doing? (INAUDIBLE) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Off. Outta here. Oh, come on. I was watching! When ain't you watching? Paying customers only. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Y'all forgettin' it's the Lord's time. Shit. That's devil music. Little girls shouldn't be watchin' that. Go home. MAN ON TV: ...life and death matter with them. They were driven to their knees. They acknowledged their sins and they confessed. And they said, "Moses, we've sinned against God." We'll see you later. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Go away! Let me in! (KICKING DOOR) I'll tell if you don't let me in. What have you got to tell about? About Miss Marissa. RICHARD: What about Miss Marissa? What about Miss Marissa? Here's your popsicle. Mommy sent it. I saw you. When? The other morning, two days ago. Where? I can't remember. In your room. So? She cleans the house for us, she's got to be in there sometimes. She didn't have any clothes on. Of course she did. She didn't. I was taking photographs. If I'm going to be a photographic artist, there's nothing wrong with that. Stop that! I saw you this morning, you didn't have any lights on. You can't take photographs in the dark, without any lights on. Put that down! I can take pictures. Can I see the prints? No. Has Mommy seen the prints? She doesn't like Marissa. You wouldn't tell her. You wouldn't dare. Are your hands clean? Something terrible is going to happen to you some day because you can't shut up about anything. I don't think she's pretty at all. She's a bit fat. She ought to be on a diet. No, she shouldn't. She's hairy. At least Mommy shaves hers off. If you say anything to anybody... I wouldn't if we were friends, and friends always lend friends money. Go buy yourself a Coke. Two Cokes. Four Cokes. Bitch! Hope your teeth rot! Investigators still have no identity, cause of death or other clues about what may have happened. FEMALE REPORTER: Sheriff's investigators say the missing parts including the torso, head, hands and feet are crucial in identifying... Why are you watching that? That's not for children. Then why do they put it on? They put it on because it's the news. Find something more suitable for children. I don't want a party. No party? Why not? Uncle David's coming. He's got a great big present for you. Don't you want a present? Not from Uncle David. But, darling, why not? Because he's not my daddy. Well, of course he's not Daddy. (SIGHING) The shrimp are so fresh. We're very lucky. You know, your daddy used to love to buy them right off the boats. Thelma, Uncle David has been very kind to Mommy. And she doesn't know what she would've done without him. Honey. Daddy is dead, and he's not going to come back to us. Now we have to get used to that. Please? MR. HARRISON: Now, you just get your basket, honey. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) I'll get the big bag. Come on upstairs. MRS. HARRISON: Elizabeth, Daddy'll get that bag. Come on. Let's go. I'm hungry. MR. HARRISON: It's hot. You okay? Yeah. Hi, there! Hi. What's your name? Thelma. Where are you from? Over there. Oh, great. Neighbors. I like that. I'm Harry. Harry Harrison. Honey. Looks like we've got ourselves a new pal. This is Elizabeth. That's Thelma. Why don't you take her on upstairs and give her a Coke? That's if somebody remembered to turn the ice box on. (SIGHS) Come on, the sun is shining. You're going to be buddies. What's it like here? (SIGHING) That bad, huh? This is Station WLIZ, with me, Liz Harrison speaking, all the way from 1:00 till 3:00. Be hap now. You going to show me around? I'm nine tomorrow. I'm nine now. I'm having a party. Am I invited? If you want. Hey, you nitwit. Ouch! Don't saw the wings. You saw the garage. I see the garage but I don't saw the garage. You are murdering the king's English. You saw one side and Larry will saw the other. Oh, I see. I saw. (SCREAMING) I was watching! BARKEEPER: You ain't paying. (MAN SCREAMING ON TV) (MUTES TV) THELMA: She was waiting. She wants a Coke. Can I charge it? I left my money. Who's your friend? Elizabeth. Got any plastic? A Benjie? A hundred dollar bill? Well then, why don't you take your butt on outta here? Fresh air's free. There you go, a dozen on the half. Great. Best in the Gulf. Two hours ago them oysters were swimming at the bottom of the ocean. Oysters don't swim. Mine do! Now, if there's anything else y'all need, just give me a shout. ROBERT: Oh, yeah, hang on a sec. Sandcastle. Would you know where that is? Uh, it's a rental, right? Uh-huh. Didn't the real estate agent give you no map? Well, yes. He gave me this. That's on the plantation, right? What you do, you go down here, about half a mile, past them boats, then you zigzag and you'll find it. Just ask them girls. (CHUCKLES) Hi. Hi. Two hours ago, these little fellows were swimming along at the bottom of the sea. Oysters don't swim! One thing's for sure, they didn't swim fast enough or they wouldn't have been caught. They're loaded with cholesterol. Make you have a heart attack. Mmm, really. And where did you get that information? My daddy. Goes jogging every day, does he? He's dead. She told me. Oh, Jesus! Oh, I'm sorry. A big mouth, talk too much. I am sorry. How old are you? Almost 10. Liar! She said she'd be nine tomorrow! Nine tomorrow, then 10. She's going to have a party. You can come. Well, if we're around, that would be terrific. I bet you'll get lots of presents. Tell me, what would be your favorite, if you had the whole world to choose from? A camera. (LAUGHING) A cam... You're English. Got it in one. Do you know the Queen? Well, I haven't seen her for a long time. I've been working over here in your country. Robert. Uh, don't you think we ought to find out where we're going? Yes. Well, are you two going to show us where Sandcastle is? Right, we'll be friends then. (EXHALES) Hey! How y'all doing? What's happening? BARKEEPER: Hey, Little Billy. Can't wait all day. This way. He's pretty good. It's easy. You're a hard lady to satisfy, kid. I'm not kid, I'm Thelma. Okay, Thelma. ELIZABETH: We saw it on the Soul Train. THELMA: So did I. ROBERT: You kids watch TV all the time? THELMA: I'm studying. ROBERT: Ah, yes, photography. Right? THELMA: Yep. ELIZABETH: I'm studying, too. I'm going to be a TV star. DOROTHEA: Oh, really? Me, too. They're the oyster boats. They catch oysters. The bigger boats are the shrimpers. They catch shrimp. (LAUGHING) They're only supposed to go out for a day. Sometimes they stay out longer. Yeah. Why's that? 'Cause they're liars. So they can jack up the price. My mom says they cheat. I'm sure your mother wouldn't say that. She can say whatever she likes. We turn left here. No, we don't. Says so on the map. THELMA: Then the map's wrong. (SIGHS) Well, thank you. Okay, kid. You're the pilot. You said you were going to call me Thelma, not kid. (CHUCKLES) Thelma. (SIGHS) So, this is Sandcastle. You got the keys? The agent gave them to you. Mmm-mmm. Are you on vacation, too? Well, kind of. Just ambling down south to see my wife's mother. We thought we'd sneak a few days to ourselves. ELIZABETH: How far have you come? Oh, far enough, kid. My name is Elizabeth. (CHUCKLES) Yes, I know. Sorry. Look, if you two want to wait till I've got the luggage upstairs, I'll give you a lift home. No, thank you. Okay. Well, thanks, again. You have a good birthday. (BIRD CHIRPING) This is Station LIZ and this is me, Liz Harrison speaking. He's nice. He's a flake. He bought you a Coke. And they're not married. How do you know? She hasn't got a wedding ring. She has lots of rings. A wedding ring is gold and you wear it on a special finger. She's his mistress. What's that? Someone you do it with when it's not right. Stupid. (FROG CROAKING) ELIZABETH: (WHISPERING) Come on. Go for it. (PANTING) Come on. (WHISPERING) I'm coming. What if we get caught? We won't. (SHUSHING) Shh! Get down. (SIGHS) THELMA: Come on. But keep down. My knee. It's broken. (DOOR OPENING) Crawl backwards. (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) THELMA: Run. ELIZABETH: Ouch! My leg. Come on. He'll catch us. (FOOTSTEPS PATTERING) (ALL CLAPPING) Thank you, thank you, friends. I just want to say how happy Judith and I are to see you here, and, of course, Thelma, our little birthday lady. Of course, speaking for myself, I don't look forward to birthdays anymore. (PEOPLE LAUGH) But when you're nine years old and as pretty as Thelma, well... On this special day, and with great affection, we toast the birthday girl for her near perfection. Thelma. ALL: * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, dear Thelma * Happy birthday to you (ALL CHEERING) (WHISTLING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) UNCLE DAVID: All in one breath now. Yay! Did you make a wish? Don't tell us what it was. Then happy days, let's cut the cake. Elizabeth here will help you pass it round. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) He knows. I'm scared. Don't have to be. Why? Because it's my birthday and not yours. Hi, Robert. My birthday cake. Thank you. Is that my present? Could be. You're a couple of little nasties, aren't you? You sneak up on a guy in the middle of the night and then when he calls you, you run away. We didn't think you knew. With your footprints all over the place? I'd be pretty dumb not to. We came to see you. Yes, I gathered that. When we got there, you were talking to Dorothea. Oh, and you didn't want to interrupt. Tell me. What was I saying? We couldn't hear. She's not your wife, is she? I thought you said you couldn't hear anything? We couldn't. We couldn't. Come on. Come on. Now. (SOFTLY) I'm only going to tell you this once. I lied to you. Now, that's not very friendly, I agree. But she's not my wife, she's my partner. Like Cagney and Lacey? Well, kind of. A spy? Uh, no. I'm a reporter, and I'm on to a very big story. Now, these men, and they talk in a foreign language, so you can guess who they are, are trying to steal the secrets for a new bomb. Now, they don't know that I'm on to them. And if they did... (IMITATING KNIFE CHOPPING) So, I've got to trust you. As friends of mine. As silent partners. Not a word to anybody, not your moms, not your daddies, nobody! Now, just as long as we understand each other. Okay? Okay. Well, no gentleman comes to visit a young lady on her birthday without bringing a present. So... I hope it's what you wanted. Have fun. And thank your mother for the invitation. She's a lovely lady, but, unfortunately, I can't stay. Duty calls. Mmm. And remember... (SHUSHING) I feel awful. He shouldn't have told us they were married when they're not. It's so the spies won't know who they are. You're stupid. No, I'm not. You are. What is it? Don't you know? Wow! It's a bribe. So we won't tell. MAN ON RADIO: I don't know what the story is with him. It's not a bad morning outside. We have partly cloudy skies, 75 degrees... Hello, Dorothea? Oh, it's you. Robert! I wanted to say thank you for the camera. It's magic. Great. I'm glad you like it. Yes, pet. Well, if it isn't the little lady, 10 next birthday. You do look funny, all that soap on your face. Well, it's the price you have to pay if young ladies come to visit gentlemen at this time in the morning. My daddy used an electric. Well, there you go. You see, some of us have to use good old-fashioned soap and water. Now you're here, do you want a Coke? I came to say thank you for the camera. That's all right. You snap away. Show your friends when you're back at school. It's a boarding school, I don't have any friends. Oh, I can't believe that. They don't like me at school. (LAUGHS) Really? Why do you suppose that is? I guess I'm just too clever. They don't like clever people. Can I take your picture? No! Robert! No, no, no, no! Not like this! With soap all over my face. What would the fans say? I didn't mean to upset you, Robert. No, of course not. We're friends, aren't we? I was hoping you'd show me how to use the camera. It's got instructions. You read the instructions. What time is it? Hey, what am I doing hanging around? I've got to get down to the bank. Now, you shoo, shoo, Miss Thelma. And you, Miss Dotty. We've got to get into the fast lane. Now, you have a nice day. Why don't you go? I just came to say thank you. Well, you've said it. Goodbye. I just wanted to take Robert's picture. Robert's got enough pictures taken by me. So long, kid. Thelma. Thelma! Bye, Robert. ROBERT: Bye! See that brat, she's jealous. ROBERT: Of us? Don't be ridiculous. Why aren't you shaving in the bathroom? (SIGHS) Once a slob, always a slob. So, what do you want to do? Move. Go someplace else. There is no place else. We can't move on every time you get spooked. (SIGHING) Hell, we could've chosen a worse place. The ocean, the beach, you, me. Nothing to do, except waste our time nicely until the systems have worked their way through. Come on. When they find out, then the bank will charge the insurance company. And the insurance company? I don't think they're so short of money that they're going to worry about me and you. And your wife? With the house, life insurance, the car? You've got to be kidding. She's going to think that you've got the bad end of the bargain. If I were Thelma's age, I'd be jealous, too. (CHUCKLES) I'm glad you belong to me. My daddy told me to drag me toes. It scares away the stingray. My daddy wants to live here all the time, like you do. We don't live here. We don't live anywhere. You have to live somewhere. Why? Because you have to pay taxes. Only if you're stupid. My daddy does. My daddy doesn't. He doesn't do anything. If we went to the same school, you could have me as your best friend. I guess so. (GIGGLING) What is it? Shh! (ROBERT AND DOROTHEA CHATTERING) ELIZABETH: Where are they going? Maybe something's happening. Gosh! Wish we had your camera. (ROBERT AND DOROTHEA MOANING) (CAMERA CLICKS) (CAMERA WHIRRING) Have you seen it before, I mean, people really doing it? I have. Sometimes. At night, on cable, when they're not home. But not like that, not with everybody watching. I know about it properly from school. But isn't she awful with all those awful sounds? And Robert! Don't do that. It's a waste! You could've got a dime on that. I'll say I lost it. I don't like him doing that with her. I would never do it. Not with everybody watching. I bet even the fishermen could see her. She's awful. BOTH: Flakey! (BOTH LAUGHING) I only took some pictures. There's nothing wicked about taking pictures. If it was wicked, they shouldn't have been doing it! I want them! Only if you promise not to tell anyone that I developed and printed them. Do you promise? They're mine. If you say anything about anything to anyone, I'll say you're lying again. I'll say I didn't do it and I've never even seen them. I'll say I did it. I'll say... Don't be stupid! You couldn't do them. You don't know anything about photography. I do. Yeah. And mice can paint pictures. Here, you can clean the boat shed, and you might need this in case your eyes pop out. Very funny. ELIZABETH: What are you going to do with them? I think we should send them to the papers and have them printed. Then everybody'll know. Then they'll be sorry. I think they should pay us a lot of money not to tell. You're not going to stand there and tell them, are you? I'd melt in pieces. We could send them one, put it in their mailbox, then they'd know. (SLOW ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) THELMA: And we could write them a note saying they had to pay us, with words cut out of a newspaper. I've seen kidnappers do it. ELIZABETH: How are we going to get the money? They could leave it somewhere, and we could get it when they've gone. Hi, hon. Hi. How's the coffee? Hot. Got pancakes. Anything? No. Circulars, send a coupon, win a prize. (SIGHING) I was wondering whether to drive in and speed up the arrangements about the cash. Alone? Yeah. Well, the two of us together, there's always a risk. Honey, I'm not your wife. What is it? Here. Better have a look. Read it. Read it. "Leave $100 in dollar bills in an envelope "in your car by the pharmacy..." They can't spell. Jesus. They're not very greedy either, $100. "...at 3:00 today. Do not watch. Or else." Oh, my God. Well, what are you going to do? (SHOUTING) Robert, what are you going to do? Don't get hysterical. I need to think. What's to think about? It's that little brat. (EXCLAIMS) And you had to give her a camera. Now you're being ridiculous. Me! You were the one who had to give her a camera. It's a holiday town. Everyone's got cameras. And you gave her one. Yes! To get her off our backs! Why didn't you just tell her to get lost? Afraid she might stop loving you? Dotty. Dotty, Dotty. She's nine years old! And kids of nine don't think like that! Oh, no. Kids of nine are holy, innocent little lambs! Shut up! Either say something helpful, or don't say it. They're professional blowups done by an expert, not by a kid of nine! (GUNS COCKING) MAN ON TV: Aim! ELIZABETH: How do you know they're not out? Because they wouldn't leave the windows open. Then how do you know he's read it? Because I saw him on the verandah earlier, and I could tell he'd read it. I expect they don't care. I was watching! You're always watching. He probably tore it up. He'd have to be pretending then. MAN ON TV: You poor son of a bitch. (GUNS FIRING) I doubt he'll leave us the money. At least he just won't leave it and go away. He'll see us. Stay at home, then. No. I'm gonna come. (CAR HONKING) What are you two up to? We're going shopping. What for? Just to look. You better get in the back. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Don't you get bored, just looking? You don't mind the heat? I like it. Well, you kids want a Coke? No, thank you, Robert. We're going shopping. Well, suit yourselves. Thanks for the ride. Yes. Thank you. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) What's he going in there for? So he can watch. He's got to wait till 3:00. What are we gonna do about it? Wait till 3:00. MAN ON RADIO: Well, that's all for me today. But I'm going to hand you over to my buddy, Rock-a-badu, Rock-a-bye Rick keeping you company from 3:00 to 5:00. I'm outta here into that gorgeous sunshine. Stay tuned and stay cool. All yours, my buddy. Hi. I've lost Thelma, Robert. She's my friend. Can I sit down? It's really hot. (SIGHS) Yes, but one side or the other. You're a better door than a window. I'm looking for something. Well, sit down. No, not there, over there. Would you like another Scotch? Uh, no. A Coke for the lady. Wow! Oh, gee! (GRUNTING) For Christ's sake, cut it out! Sit down! Everything is closed. Then I lost her. Have you seen her, Robert? Thelma, she's my friend. No, I haven't seen her. Would you leave the curtain alone? Of course. There you go. (SIGHING) Yes, thank you. Excuse me, please. You're welcome. I've gotta pay. No, I'll pay. (GRUNTS) Jesus! I'm sorry, Robert. Ah, it's all right. It'll dry. I guess it's the heat. Here's your friend. (PANTING) I was over there. I shouted, but you didn't hear. What? That man. (STAMMERS) He was looking in your car. The black kid. Right. ROBERT: Hey! Hey! Yes, you. Stop! Come here! BOTH: Yeah! (DOG BARKING) (PANTING) Hey! Hey, is this the guy? No, Robert. Hey, man, what'd I do? You ran! Well, so did you, man. (BOTH PANTING) Sorry. Would you please buy yourself a drink? No, man. You drink it yourself. You need it more than me. You saw him. What was he like? Thin. Uh-huh. And he went to the car. Then what? He bent down. He closed the door. And I shouted for you. And he ran? Right. Was it important? Yes. It could be. You got it? (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) What are you going to do with yours? Buy something. What? A present. A radio. Like Little Billy's. Then I can play my tapes. I'm going to invest mine. I'll ask my daddy. You can't. You can't tell anybody. ELIZABETH: If I spend it, then we have to give them the negative back. That's what you're supposed to do. They pay and you've spent it, you're supposed to give it back. I don't care what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to do what you want to do. (LAUGHING) We've got them. The negatives. Would you believe for a hundred lousy bucks? We've got them. We've won! No. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! (IMITATING FRENCH ACCENT) What will he do without the negatives? And I look at these negatives and I say to myself, "Eh, what a sexy couple." Burn them. Yes. (BOTH LAUGHING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (WHISPERING) Come on. (WHISPERING) I am. (SHUSHING) Good God! She hasn't even made the bed! THELMA: You can't wear that. Yes, I can. It's fashion. It's backwards. It's supposed to be that way, stupid. Besides, you can't wear them. They'll find your fingerprints. No, they won't. Neat! What are you looking for? To see if they're gangsters. If they were, they'd kill us. And it'd be your fault. If you do that, they're gonna be real mad. God, what do they drink that stuff for? (GASPING) It's Robert and Dorothea. They've stolen money. Lots of it. Where? From a bank. "Robert Burger and a mysterious lady "thought to be traveling with him..." It says that no one knows where they are. (CAMERA CLICKING) What did you do that for? Evidence. And so they won't know we've seen it. I think we should tell the sheriff. I mean, we ought to. Uh-uh. Why not? 'Cause he'll take the reward and cheat us. How much? A lot. I told you. Is it loaded? (THELMA SIGHS) You're not going to keep it, are you? It's dangerous. Only if you don't know how to use it. You don't know how to use it. Sure I do. You just point it at someone and pull the trigger. Easy. You couldn't really kill anybody. Well, I could. Just point it at someone, and pull the trigger, and see all the blood and guts and stuff? If you hated somebody or wanted something... I think you're... No, I'm not! (GASPS) Stop it, Deputy. Stop it! Stop it! Why? 'Cause you're scaring me. Anyway, you shouldn't be scared. Only babies are scared. You'd be scared, too. You'd be scared if Robert knew you'd got his money. You'd be scared if he knew you'd got his gun. You wouldn't tell him. I might. Would you? It's not loaded. How do you know? All right. I promise I won't tell. I promise! I don't like you. Friends shouldn't scare other friends. Other friends shouldn't make them. They're coming back! What do we do? Hide. Where? There! My glasses! (ELIZABETH EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) ROBERT: What the... I'll suffocate. ROBERT: I don't believe this! Dotty, come here! Didn't I tell you to close the windows? What is the point of locking all the doors when the bloody windows are wide open? Didn't I tell you to do that? Don't holler at me! If it's that black bastard with the big smile... You don't know that. I don't need to know! Look at the window. What a bloody invitation! You can't just say it's him. Well, whoever it is, he's gone. What's more, he knows that we can't go to the police. Well, what? Take a look around, see what he's taken. My jewelry. Oh, God. It's all here. Then what the hell has he taken? (WHISPERING) Let's go, please. (GROANS) I'm suffocating. I can't breathe. I can't help it, I'll scream. (WHISPERING) If you scream, I'll shoot you. The gun, have you seen it? The ammunition. He didn't touch the bonds. Probably didn't know what they were. The newspaper with the pictures! What? You've still got that? Get rid of it, burn it. Let's see if we can start moving the bonds now. I said now. Don't start clearing up! This time I'll close the bloody window. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (CAR DRIVING AWAY) They're going. Come on. I don't want to. I hate you. ELIZABETH: Ouch! (SOBBING) I hate you. You're not my friend. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMS) MRS. DAVIES: Darling, isn't it time to turn that off and get some sleep? Darling? MRS. HARRISON: Come on, honey, she's waiting for you. Honey, for me? Richie's finished the new pictures. You're not my friend. Yes, I am. Because we've been doing lots of stuff together. No, we haven't. Do your mom and dad know about what's going on? How could they know unless somebody tells them? You wouldn't. I'm not planning to. I'd kill you. You wouldn't. You don't have a gun. I'd get somebody to do it for me. Somebody you couldn't see. Like a hit man. You don't know any. Yes, I do. I'm going to tell them about you. I'm going to give Bob his money back and say I'm sorry. Then they'll say it was just because I was a silly girl. Never mind as long as I've learned my lesson. In fact I'm going to tell them everything. About you? Or about me, too? They'll know I didn't do it all by myself. You could say it was just somebody. They'd know it was you even if I didn't say a name. Okay. I think we should both go. We could take them these new pictures, too. After supper. We'll both go. Except, Mom doesn't want me out late. Well, we can go tomorrow, instead of going swimming. Okay? Now we know for certain that he knows. Funny kind of relief. What does he say? Not a thing. No note. Doesn't say anything. Hey. Hey. What does he want? That's what he wants. He wants you to have hysterics. He wants me to eat my heart out. (SHOUTING) But why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Hey, babe, babe. Hey, come on. Come on. (CRYING) Hey, hey. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down, honey. It's all right. It's all right. It's not going to be long, hmm? There's a babe. There's a babe. Come on. Huh? Huh? (SOBBING) I'm going to take a shower. We'll talk about this later. Robert! Robert, stop. If we're going to have a fight, let's have it. I've tried. Honest to God, I've tried. Me, too. But you were there, you heard it yourself. Three more days. Robert! Hey, hang on a sec. I locked that window. Did you open it? That means someone was hiding in here. Got out the same way that they came in. He must have been as thin as a match. All of a sudden, I think I know who it is. ELIZABETH: You got the pictures? THELMA: In my purse. How about your sunglasses? In my purse. Do you keep everything in your purse? Do you really think we should tell him? Pee Wee Herman would. Then we could be friends again. Like Little House on the Prairie. When the girls' father comes back and they forgive him. I don't really want to tell Robert. I wish we hadn't done it in the first place. They started it. They shouldn't have done what they did. Can I see the pictures, please? ELIZABETH: I wanna see the pictures again. For the last time. You're going to tell them everything, aren't you? Yes, but I don't want to. Why are you going to, if you don't want to? Because I have to. We don't have to. But I want to. That's what we said. I want the pictures, they're mine. If I'm going to tell, I have to show them. Yes, I guess so. Think they'll be up yet? They might be. ELIZABETH: All right. This is Station WLIZ, let's do it. No! We're not going to tell them! But you said. I never was going to tell them. But you said you were going to tell them about me. Stop joking around, Thelma. Put the gun down. Please? We're friends. No, we're not, you said so. I didn't mean it. I won't tell. Don't shoot me, it might hurt. Please? Please? It's your fault for making me. (GUN FIRES) (CRYING) (GUN FIRES) (CRYING) (GROANS) Oh, God. (GUN FIRES) I didn't hear you come in. Have you seen Richard? Mr. Burger was over looking for him. What for? I didn't ask. It's none of my business, and I don't think it's any of yours. You really got that shirt very dirty. I want you to take it off. Don't be late. This is Station WLIZ, and this is me. Yes, Thelma, what is it? My mom wanted me to tell you that she hasn't seen Richard. When I see him, do you want me to tell him to come and see you? Yeah. Tell him to come running. Aren't you and him friends anymore? Just tell him to come. Is Elizabeth here? She said she was coming to see you. Well, she didn't. Now, look, I'm very busy. I think she's lost. She'll turn up. Just tell your brother. Richard's gone off, too. It never occurs to them that they might be upsetting people. At least he's nearly an adult. She's a child of nine. Look, we don't know that anything's happened yet. I'm sure there's some perfectly reasonable explanation. Now, you were playing together. Didn't she say where she was going? She said she was going to see Robert. Did she say what she was going to see him for? Could she have gone somewhere with him? For a ride? Did she say, "Goodbye," or "I'll see you later?" Can you remember exactly where you were when she left? Can you show me? Would you mind? It might just spark something off. Oh, no, of course not. Thelma will help you. Do you think my wife could stay with you, just for a while, till we get back? She's a bit distraught. Not unreasonably. What did she want to see me for? Do you know? How long has she been gone? Since this morning. So, what are you going to do now? Wait another hour, and then call in the police. There's not much else I can do. I have no idea where to look. She could be anywhere. Yes, I suppose so. Get dressed. Was that the boy? What did he say? Just move it. We're getting out. They're bringing in the police. Get your clothes on. ROBERT: You moving? Oh, Jesus, Dotty! (GIGGLES) Come on. Come on. We've no time. We've no time. Come on. Come on, baby. There's a girl. Come on, sweetheart. Oh, no, you don't! Come on. Come on, then. Are you going to get ready? Yeah, I'm going to get ready. Five minutes? What? I love you. (LAUGHING) (YELPS) Now why did I think that screwing you would sweeten my life? Because it did. Say it again. Say you love me. I love you. You're not mad at me? No, I'm not mad at you. Just mad. We're both mad. (CHUCKLES) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Could you hold on, just a minute, please? My lady's not very well. We were just going to see the doctor. Well, the sheriff wants to have a word with all of us. We're just on our way to see the doc. What doctor's that? Well, we thought we'd check it out. Blue Cross, or whatever. There's a child missing, sir. I appreciate your predicament, but the sooner we can ask some questions, the sooner we're gonna get some answers and everybody's gonna be happy. Certainly, if there's a child missing. That's what we're gonna find out. So, if you'll just turn your vehicle around, my deputy there will back up and give you some room. I do appreciate it. Thank you. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) (CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) We're making inquiries about a little girl. Thelma? Elizabeth Harrison. Have you seen her today? No, I've been out all day. Where? Walking. All day? Didn't you find it a mite hot? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, it was hot. I was sweating. Who'd you see on this walking? No one. No one? Seems to me, if a person goes out walking all day, he sees someone, like Elizabeth? No, I already told you. I haven't seen Elizabeth all day. But you saw someone. Now, who was it? I can't tell you. Richard! We're all very worried about Elizabeth. Help the sheriff. Please. Do you know that you're the only one who can't account for himself all day? Richard, tell him! Okay. You want to know who it was? I was with Marissa, okay? Who? She used to work for us. And now she works for someone else. I went to see her because she said she was having my baby. That's ridiculous! Please, ma'am. I'm just trying to find out where he was all day. Yes, but you see, he doesn't understand that by lying... Lying? I'm not lying! If you weren't so blind, so involved with yourself and your Uncle David this, your Uncle David that. Thelma knew. I thought everybody knew. About a baby? No. That was just her way of shutting it down, of finishing with me. Richard! Anyway, it wasn't true. Can she back up your story? Yes. If you mean, can she tell you I was with her, yes. Okay. You tell me where I can find her and that'll be that. (SIREN WAILING) Mr. Burger called. He said he wanted to talk to you. What about? I don't know. He didn't say. Well, then it can't be that important, can it? Richard, I've called Uncle David and asked him to come back. I can't manage by myself anymore. (SIGHING) You could've asked me. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Hi, Uncle David. Hey, Thelma. How's my girl? Great. Honey, Uncle David wants to talk to you. You see, hon, something serious might have happened to Elizabeth, and your mother and I would never forgive ourselves if... Nearly everybody in this whole world is kind and good, just as you see them. But some people are not so good. So we don't want you to go anywhere by yourself until Elizabeth's been found. Okay? Yes, Uncle David. Suppose they never find her? The police always find people. Maybe not always right away. Okay, now you promise me. Promise Uncle David. Okay, Uncle David. I promise. MRS. DAVIES: Good. Do you need that? You're going to leave me? I'm getting ready to go. DOROTHEA: Without me? Babe. Why are you doing this to us? I got us into this. I'll get us out of it. You can't. They're looking for the car. We'll walk. We can't leave the pictures. You can't get them tonight. Jesus, Dotty, it took us one year and 15 days to plot this, to get away from the crap. Just because some little kid goes missing, I'm not going to let ourselves get trapped in it. If you're thinking of leaving without me... (SCOFFS) Go to bed, Dotty. (DOGS BARKING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Better come in. Sit down. Do you want a drink? Uh, Scotch please. No, Scotch. Do you have any rye? Rye. Sit down. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Now, you little shit, I want those photographs back and if you open your mouth, I'll make sure that you never open it again. You clear? You're hurting... Yes, and if I wanted to, I could break your wrist. Please, I don't know what you're talking about, sir. You broke in here! I've never been here before. Don't lie! Right. We'll see if we can refresh your memory. You've seen this before? Where? Where? Somebody gave it to me. Yes, people bring you film and you process it. Who? I don't know. My sister. (GROANS) Your sister? Yes. You gave her the camera for her birthday. She got me to show her how to use it. She gave me some other pictures, too, of you and your... Look, I didn't know until I developed them. I didn't know she'd taken pictures like that. She's a nine-year-old kid. Nine-year-old kids aren't into blackmail. Thelma is. She always blackmails me. What a little sweetheart. Who taught her all this? (SIGHS) Some people are just born that way. Oh, no. No, people are not born that way. When my father died, it upset me. But not Thelma. She just sat around. Just the same as always. Just watching TV, all day long. Why didn't you tell your mother? She's like Thelma. She doesn't listen. Thelma. Dotty said it all. So simple. What about the story in the papers? That's just the press. Look, I want those pictures. Can you get them for me? Well, do you think you could persuade Thelma to come here? Look. I didn't hurt the other kid. I don't know anything about her. I just want those pictures and to give her a damn good frightening. I'll try. REPORTER ON TV: In the worst case, a team member could get wounded or killed entering a structure. TEAM MEMBER: We require the smallest man on our team to be able to get the larger man on our team out. Harrison said they're bringing in dogs. No one's ever going to find her. They don't even know if she's lost, do they? I want to see you. In my room. ...primary concern would be getting him out and getting him aid. Excuse me, Uncle David. Keep an eye on her. The police don't want her going anywhere alone. Mr. Burger wants to see you. I don't want to see him. He wants the pictures that you took. I didn't take any pictures. Elizabeth took them. You're lying! You lie about everything. I'm not lying. Somebody ought to get rid of you. We'd all be a lot better off without you. You just want Mom to yourself. Are you going to give him the pictures? I don't have them! (SIGHS) Then he'll have to go to the police. It's not my fault! I'm not a liar! And I'll have to tell them everything that I know. This is my room. Get out! (DOG WHINING) Oh, son of a bitch. Just keep searching. We found these with the little girl's clothes. They're kind of intimate, don't you think? How do you reckon she got them? Thelma, the other girl, took them with a camera that I gave to her for her birthday. Her brother printed them. She was using them to blackmail me. A kid of nine? Yeah, I didn't believe it either, until her brother told me. Look, ask... Why have they come back? You want to sit down, ma'am? Sit down, dear. Oh, Jesus. Is that all? You expecting something more? (STAMMERING) No, it's... We hadn't seen them all, just the ones she sent. Is that why you killed her? Robert? Elizabeth. They found her clothes buried in the wood. Jesus. What about that black kid I saw in your car? Little Billy? There's a funny thing. Every time something goes wrong in this town, somebody blames Little Billy, and I got to pull him in and let him go. Now, you were telling me? Well, it was both the girls. They wanted $100, and I was intrigued to know who sent the notes. I paid them. You still got the note? I burned it. (SIGHS) You got a gun? Yes. A Charter Arms .38 police special. Can I see it? (SIGHS) It was stolen. We were broken into two days ago. You reported it? No, I know who stole it. Her brother told me. This morning, he told me everything. Okay. You can kiss the lady goodbye. Hey. Hey, it's all right. It's all right, hon. I'll be back. Richard will tell them everything. Just because we were photographed on the beach with our pants down hardly makes it a crime! Not in this state. Then why are you taking him in? Homicide, ma'am. That Charter Arms .38 police special, we found it this morning, buried with these photographs, wrapped up in that little girl's clothes. There was a lot of blood around. You stupid bastard, it was stolen! (GROANING) I don't mind no man showing off his tail, ma'am, not even in the daylight. But I can't abide child killers. She's lying! She's laughing at you! Now why would she do that? Just to cause some trouble? (YELLING) You're a mite perkier in the flesh than you are in these photographs. I reckon we'll just take you along, for now. Just in case. Hi. I just want to ask you some questions. It's going to be all right, darling. Mommy's going to be right here. Okay. You know what we think happened to your friend. I'm very sorry. Now, your friend, Elizabeth, she had some photographs in an envelope. Do you know how she got them? I took them. Why? Because we saw them near the beach. But why take photos? 'Cause she made me. She did. Elizabeth. How did she make you? She twisted my arm. Like this. She hurt me. What happened then? She stopped twisting my arm. After you got the photographs then what did you do? She sent one to Robert. She asked for money. And she collected the money? We both did. She made me. She said she was going to hurt me. What did she do with it? The money. She kept it. All of it? She didn't give you any of it? Except for $10 for the other pictures. What other pictures? About Robert and Dorothea, stealing, in the newspaper. Richie said he wouldn't do the pictures unless we paid for the chemicals. Have you still got those other pictures? About them stealing? I expect Richie's got them. That's fine. Then we'll get them from him. The last time you saw Elizabeth, where was she headed? To Robert's. What for? To get more money. But you didn't go with her? I didn't want to. Didn't she say that she'd twist your arm? Yes. Well? I ran away. She didn't catch me. And that was the last time that you saw her? You're a lucky girl. We could be looking for two bodies. We'll have you bring her down later to make a formal statement. What pictures was the sheriff talking about? Thelma, I'm asking you. You believe me, Uncle David. Of course I do. Of course Uncle David believes you. You heard what the sheriff said. I mean, it might have been... But it wasn't. Can I get some ice cream? No, no, not now. Let her go. I think we all need a change. Get back to the city. Forget about all this. (SIGHS) Thank you, Uncle David. Okay, bye. What's happening? Got to call in later. Any time? Nope. Well, let's go then, huh? (ROBERT BREATHING HEAVILY) Damn! (LAUGHING) See him? Where is the son of a bitch? Hear you all been making the news. Ah, you keep it. You be a good girl now. Have a nice day. Bullshit! Just get off your butts and find him! The son of a bitch and bank clerk. Are you talking to me? I don't want to know nothing. You just get him back inside. (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) You'll be laughing now, lady, but he'd better show up or he gets his head blowed off. Thelma! Thelma! Come on. Come on, quickly. Quickly. ROBERT: It'll have to be quick. I haven't much time. Now, why did you do it, Thelma? That's all I want to know, kid. Why? I gave you the camera. God knows you had a good time with it. I thought we were friends. Weren't we? So what did I do? What? You don't like me? Or you don't like Dotty? What? You ruin a man's life. You can't get pleasure out of that. Why ruin the one last shot I had? Maybe you think it's all a game? Oh, no, it's real life out there. They'll shoot me, Thelma. I don't get to walk home. Let me get rid of that. No. Yes, but... Look, look. You understand? Yes, I think you do. Come on, look. We're going to walk out of here together, with our hands up, and we're going to tell them that you took the gun and that somebody stole it from you. We don't know who. We're going to tell them the truth. Look, me, too. I'm going to tell them that I took a little money from the bank. Well, who was going to notice it? It was meant to buy a little sunshine for Dotty and me. If I'd had a little girl like you then perhaps I would never have done it. Maybe I would've stayed at home. Look, we've both been bad, you and me. So let's both make things right. Yes? Tell them what you did, I'll tell them what I did. Sound fair? Look, all the sheriff has to do is talk to you. Hey! Maybe they'll find fingerprints on the gun. Maybe they'll find out who stole it. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) What the hell's happening out there? Son of a bitch! No, no! No, no! Back! No! Hey! (SIREN WAILING) (GUN FIRES) No! (CRYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (SIREN WAILING) Well, I heard the kid screaming, and he ran at me. Well, looks like you just saved the county the cost of a trial. (CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) And some dude lawyer collecting his fee. What do you reckon happened to the money he stole? Sure as hell won't be coming to you or me. Come on, lady. Come on out of there. I want to put you in this other car. Right over here. Put her in there. You reckon the DA'll let her go free? Free as she'll ever be. (SIREN WAILING) OFFICER: Okay, folks, come on. The show's over.
