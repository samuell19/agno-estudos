Make some space man... Let there be some air circulation, go from here. Patela, come let's go. Bro, what’s up? A game or film? F*** results are out man.. Patela, What happened with the tickets? They have been booked. Just have to get my bags. What happened? First class! Didn’t I tell you? Unnecessarily you were getting anxious. Did you check mine? Go check yourself. Didn’t I tell you Patela.. ..these girls are never to be trusted. Why didn’t you say? He is so lazy! Let him sweat a bit too. He makes me do all his work, always. Anyway, where is this stupid Meera? She was to come right here, isn’t it? Every time it’s the same with her. Careless about exam results. By the way, will you come home or will you meet at the bus station? I’ll meet at the bus station. Most likely my dad will drop me. Ok. Hey, I got my job offer letter! Wow! That is amazing! Congratulations. It's through for me, you know, right? But... I want to do my masters. When are you applying? I have already done it. Have been accepted by two universities.. *Film playing in theatre* Let us just sleep during travel, not keep talking. I am quite tired. I hope there are no bedbugs. That is the bus, I was told. Come let’s go. Meera? Oh! Ok. Thanks auntie. It seems she left at noon. If she didn't want to come, she should have informed us earlier. It’s always the same with her. It is so difficult to get her. Wonder where she went. Should we inform her mother, that she is not with us? May be we shouldn’t. It would get her worried. She will be fine wherever she is. What do we do now? Please do not change the plan. Girl: No chance. I am not returning home after coming so far. Rarely do I get permission to go on such trips. Please! Come. Come...come let’s go…let's go.. "You are the one for me, my friend" "You are the one" “You are the one for me, my friend" “You are the one" “For all the worlds inside of me" “You are the only ruler" "You are the one for me, my friend" "You are the one" “You are the one for me, my friend" "For all the talks of my heart" "You are the only form" "You are the one for me, my friend" "You are the one" "You are the one for me, my friend" This silence. This is it for me, I guess. All that I thought life was, it has been a journey of proving me wrong. Till now. I learnt life through cinema. If I am not in a theatre, hiding behind a story, here, in this place, in the arms of these mountains is where.. I feel at home. Cinema has been a friend, a companion, a guru. Everything. I feel stuck somewhere between life and cinema, Now in this real life, what to expect out of it? I don't know. How to be in this world? Not sure anymore. That day, as much as I want to forget, I can’t. My brain holds vivid visual memories, a curse or a boon, I don’t know. I think I was 9 years old. It was summer holidays, and all my friends were at their grandparents’ houses or at their relatives’ houses! I was alone, as usual. I never went to relatives houses, never felt close to any of them. These hills and those rocks were more real than any human I knew. My parents were at work. It was thrilling, I was scared but I went in anyway. I had always wanted to watch movies sitting in front rows. Dad somehow never took us there. *Film plays in theatre* I couldn’t even look at his face, I couldn’t understand what just happened, but I could feel it was wrong. I wanted to run back home But I couldn’t. I wanted to watch the film, I was there for that. I couldn’t let that man decide my movie experience. So I sat again to continue watching the film but all through looking at front rows, trying to locate who that man was. But they were all just black shadows. I don’t want to write about the abuses that I went through, my time or my mind space, such men don't deserve either. But this incident … there is a link… there is always a link to everything. My mom didn’t want me to grow up there in that town, she feared I would elope with someone! So we shifted to a bigger city. Bro, What a beautiful babe! Why sweetheart, won’t you look at me? The bus is here, let's be fast. If you go like this, you think I will leave you alone? Don't help her, she never learns. Hi, hi! I was sitting idle at home… Hey, your love interest is here. Go go...tell her today at least! Meera wait Ohhh Meeraaa... Come Saji, let's go in Is it for me? Yes for you. Why? Just like that. It was like an artwork. Considering his efforts, I couldn’t refuse it. Thanks. Just thanks? What more should I be saying? Okay… I have to write news, see she hasn't.... Here she is. Wow, what is this? He has given you a rose! But I didn’t know, accepting the rose had other meanings to it. Bro, she accepted! You managed to win over her! Say Meera!! What did you tell him? See here, I have a doubt. Sow, you first write down the formula. Cancel that, write it afresh. Hi Meera.. Hi. Hi Meera. Hi. A plus B square whole square, ok? is equal to A square plus two A B plus B square. Write down the problem. X plus six into X plus two is equal to X X plus 2 In our town, boys and girls, all used to bathe together. So this didn’t seem odd. OK Substitute the value of X *Kannada song playing in the background* Bro, what are they doing with their hands? Should we give them some money? May be we should do that. Already our class has ill-reputation, these girls are going to ruin it further. Hi Meera. What are you doing? Show! Not sure if that relationship would have become something, BUT… I feel stressed to come to school. He troubles too much. He came near bus stop yesterday, you know? Last week he had come near the tailor shop. Hi Meera. Now he is sitting here. Sajida Che! Again he is sitting behind. He is such a torture everyday. Sajida… Sajida… Meera, please ask her to talk to me. Come let’s go sit in the front. Please talk to him and resolve, Saji Else he keeps bothering me. He came near my house, asking me to show your house. I said 'I love you', why don't you say anything? Mohan please. I don’t like these things. Saji… Tell him my parents are looking for a groom for me already. What? Mohan... Mohan...Mohan... Hey, what are you doing Mohan? Ma’m, Bathroom? OK, Go. Good morning Miss. Good morning. Here as well. I love her. Tell her that. Who told you, such acts would make her fall for you? I should get her. That is it. Were they inspired by Shahrukh Khan’s film ‘Darr’, or the new release, ‘Om’? I don't know. Not sure if people remember climax of these films, but, "I Love You, You Must Love Me" was the line used to torture the girls, endlessly. In such climate, I saw 'Hum Aapke Hai Kaun' film. I was in 9th grade. *Film playing in theatre* Salman Khan became that first dream! If I ever have babies, it had to be from him, so I decided. I wrote letters every day to him. I somehow wanted to send them to him! Meera, where is the electricity bill? It must be right there, see Ma. Where is it, kid? The same breakfast again? Wasn’t it different yesterday? Did you find it? it was right there. Ma, please Ma, please don’t read it. What is all this Meera? Who is he? Salman Khan. Who is he? He is a cinema hero. This is why your exam scores have collapsed. Ma, please, that's not because of him. Please don’t say anything against him. How dare you talk back to me? If I come across something of this kind again, I won't send you to school thereafter. Now go get ready for school. That slap pushed him deeper into my heart. How would he have saved me from my mother, if he was around! On the day of white uniform, why do they have to have parade? God knows! Once our bus friend became the school leader, we had our own rules! Hey..What are you doing? Lemon rice man. This is Babu's. If he gets to know he will cry. How will he know? Only if you tell him, he will know isn't it? What are you all doing here? Eight of you. We are cleaning. Cleaning? Dust and paper pieces are scattered all over. What sort of cleaning is this? It’s clean there, see. By the time you clean, assembly would get over. You all? Stomach ache. You were fine in the morning. It began all of a sudden. Show me, what marks have you given? I can’t show like that. They will mark us as an indisciplined class again. You deserve it. The principal will make us stand out in the sun. I will see you in the bus. Go inside before somebody sees. Boys, clean properly. Sow, Doesn't Madhu look a bit like Salman Khan? Prajwal, go clean there in the front. Yes, actually. In some angles. Which angle is it? He looks a bit like monkey though. Madhu. Madhusudan. In a class of 63 students. his presence never mattered. But that day… Why are you staring? If you tell Babu… If I tell… Your lunch box will be emptied tomorrow. I got so scared. Hey...Jyothi...monkey... *National Anthem in the background* On one such Wednesday, while in white uniform and while on periods, I fell in love for the first time. Was it love? I am not sure. Or was it a desire to experience like in the movies.. between the hero and the heroine, I don't know! But I wasn’t the same old self from that moment. Meera wait, I don't have Kho Kho practice today. Come fast then. Hey what is with her? Hey Meera... Wait up. Everyday you delay, what is the hurry today? “You are the name for my deep breaths” “You are the cause of this burning heart” “You are the way out for each of my desires” “You are the destination” “You are the letters of each word I utter” “You are the echo of each unspoken word” “You are the King of this unknown world” “You are the beginning for me to know it all” “You are the anxiety of my fingers” “You are the scar of a wound that I was unaware of” “You are the pain that I deeply want” “You are reason behind the smiles and laughters” “You are the throbbing compassion of my cells” “Please be like this my love, "inside me,” “comfortably.” "I will keep you warm.” Didn't I tell you he will be late? Saji, please don't talk. Not me, she pulled me to talk. Not today. Why today? He can't stop talking about her. Are you sure? Sure? Meera, wait. What is it, Prajwal? Hey. You have been smitten by Madhu, isn’t it? Smitten? For all the turbulence within me, the word 'smitten' seemed cheap! I don’t know. But I feel somewhat...for him. Hey wait. Don’t you want to know how he feels? Hey Hey.... Even he also feels somewhat….u know? Okay. I never sweat. That day for the first time, I felt sweat break under my arm. Hey say it..What was he saying? Why are you smiling? Next day, I felt a bit awkward to go to school. I could hear my heartbeat. I felt feverish, my stomach was churning. I was pukish, felt I might have loose motions! Miss, Can I Come in? Why Meera? Why are you late? Come in. I missed the bus… errr…Stomach ache. You better decide first.. You missed the bus or stomach ache? Both. Meera Meera *Note: Meera, Shall we get married? from, Madhu* My Madhu's handwriting. I had never noticed it before. How shabbily he writes! Watching them play is such a waste of time. How badly they lost yesterday, isn't it? He came here now, see. You haven’t said anything? Regarding what? Ok. Forget it. Where are you going? Shall we? I don’t know. Now? I don’t know. Next? I don’t know. Bro Madhu, come. Coming… It is not even his bus stop, but he is walking this way today. Even this girl here is smiling. She is being secretive with us. Even Madhu failed us. He also got out. Hey, where are you going? "Even the moving breeze" "Desires your breath" "Sliding from your neckline" "Riding on the rainbow" "Reaching the destination in the finger tips" "I am you now" "Life has merged with you now" "Sliding from your neckline" "Riding on the rainbow" "Reaching the destination in the finger tips" "I am you now" We were discussing figure of speech, weren't we? Yes Mam. Today, let's understand Metaphors. What is it Madhu? Nothing madam. Shall I give you a test? No Miss. That's very bad. Sorry, Sorry Miss. If you apologise now? Can't you guys be adults? and behave once you enter the class? Go Sit. Don't repeat this mistake. "You shone” "I became the light" "Blossomed as flower" "That I became your fragrance" "You engulfed me without my notice" "Became one, melting" "Together, consuming" "You, my soulmate" "You are my soulmate!!" "Sky is vast, but what is empty?" "You are the blue that is spread across" "In each of the cells, in and out..." "You are the only one" "You are the only one" Pythagoras theorem is applicable to... Pythagoras theorem is applicable to what kind of triangles? Right angled triangles. Go, have lunch. How joyfully you say it! It is all because of him. Hey Who is the captain? It is him. Madhu. Learn to take responsibility. Did you not find anybody else to lose against? Next time we will win, sir. Go, have lunch. What happened to the match? We lost. All because of him! Why do you say so? Hi Ding. What? It is a short form for Darling. Here I was, writing poetry for him, there he is, fishing for the most unromantic word in English dictionary... Darling... chopping it further to make it 'ding'! But still it felt mine. It was just for me, from him. Shall we go for lunch? Yes. *Singing a Kannada film song* Next time call us also. Two of us are not able to win it.... Shit. Whose idea is this, to close the gate during lunch break? Must be our teddy bear principal's idea. Wait! Should I go bring your girl or what? Oh. He doesn't do it, he doesn't let us also do it. Climb. *Song playing in the radio* Brother, did you have lunch? Yes sir. Did you? Yes. It is quite cold, isn’t it? We should have got Jyothi along with us! Will bring her tomorrow. What is happening between you two? Nothing. Just… Give me a drag. Hey What is this? Like good girls, you should be asking me to quit smoking.. Instead you’re asking for a drag. Haven't you seen what the heroine does in the movies? Like a 'good girl'? Why couldn’t I judge him as good or bad, even though he was smoking? Just give it. Stop snatching. Bro... Ganganna, the attender is here. Come, let's hurry. What is this? Beetle nuts. Eat it. Else, Your mouth will stink. You had the same excuse last time as well? No miss. Go bring your notes first. Miss, miss, please. Ma’m, please correct our notes fast. I am correcting, can't you see? I will correct yours too. Go sit. There's something inside. Is it for teacher? Yes. OK. Hey! Until you bring the notes and submit, don't talk to me, go kneel down there. Go there. Miss... I will be very embarrassed in front of the girls. Please miss. *Note : I want kiss, I want kiss, Please.* What is this? Meera Meera… Meera… Monisha I have kept scale somewhere, go get it. Miss....miss...miss...no miss *Singing film songs* Sing a song from the letter ‘ma’ Again? Don’t know any other song… Pearl, pearl (also means kiss)... your speech is like a pearl Pearl, pearl Kiss it seems…Meera? Your kiss got me high Your kiss Your speech is like pearl… Do you have any doubts? No Sir. Anybody wants their answer sheets? No sir. Do you want marks? Yes sir… Come in. Why isn’t anyone scoring well? Jyothi... Good, you have improved! Prajwal.. What is this? Visit the school a bit more! Are you not able to follow my teaching? Math doesn't enter my head sir. Should I take special class for you? It would be just a waste of time, sir. In your board exams, I won’t be correcting your answer sheets to pass you all with grace marks. Meera. Very good. Thank you Sir. Stay back. Third time consecutively, Meera has scored full marks. Sir… Tell me, Madhu. What's your doubt? Sir if someone owes something to someone, if they don’t give it within the time, can we ask for interest? It depends... Who has to give who and what was the agreement.... Why? What have you borrowed, from whom? Nothing, sir. Just asked. Hypothetically. He got caught. Hypothetically! What does it mean? Do you know? If you knew, why doesn't it reflect in your marks? Where is your answer sheet? You keep walking. I will join. What is the matter? I have one doubt in math I will discuss it, then join you. Can you not do that tomorrow? I might forget it tomorrow Jyo. Okay, we will wait at the bus stop. Such a geek she is. Come soon, Meera. Come see here. Lights seem to be on. You thought I had left. Yes. Seems he had gone to wash his face. Idiot. He smelled so good. Cuticura (talcum powder)? That moment. I wanted it so much. What if I get pregnant? Pregnant? If this is how one got pregnant.... Then how? Then.... Meera? Why are you still here? Sir, I had forgotten my tiffin box. Is it a thing to forget? The rains have just stopped, reach home soon. It might start raining again. Ganganna, See that classroom. Door is open, please close it. You should check these things. She also came. finally! Hey, This year in Biology, baby... they will teach how it happens. What is that? What? What? What? That's what I am asking, what? Our biology teacher skipped that chapter. Had to watch porn later on to learn how one conceives. My spectacles is all wet. I should keep it inside. Shall we go to eat some fries? It is kind of late today Jyo. Let's go tomorrow, ok? Oh shit, he is here again. Meera, stop. I asked you not to follow us like this, didn’t I? You don’t talk to me near your school. Listen madam, our boy is talking to you. Can't you hear? Please don’t trouble me. Trouble? I like you a lot. Madam, he has gone crazy for you. Since that day he saw you in the bus stop, he talks only about you. Say something, Meera. See madam, Our boy has hero like looks. Why don’t you accept him? I can’t. Please. You can't? Why? Hey Meera Say you are already engaged. Please be silent, Saaji. Engaged? Is your marriage fixed? No, not... Jyo, stop. Don't talk about that here. Oh, is this about Madhu? No. Hey bro... He is a kid. You are at a different level from him, don't worry. Please give a thought about me. What happened? Nothing, uncle. *Auto Caption "Love is God" * Why did you have to mention about Madhu? Where did we? Then how does he know his name? *Phone rings* Hello can I talk to Meera? Sister, you have got a call. Hello Hello I will tell mom… Ding Hello… Just called Be careful Madhu. Why? What is the matter Ding? Nothing. Is someone around? Yeah. Ok...so... You gave the principal. When is the interest due? Never. Ok, I will give you the notes tomorrow. Hello… Who is it Meera, on the phone as you came home? Thanks aunty. It was Sowmya, Ma. Won't it disturb them if you keep getting calls like this. I thanked. Didn't I? Come let us make coffee. Bye Meera sister. Bye! It will be perfect for this weather. Let’s meet tomorrow. What time will you come? 6:30. Why so early? Did you complete homework? No. Okay, bye. Can’t you go a bit late? What will I answer my mother? Cook something up. What to say? What a lazy person our Hindi teacher is. Let's see how everyone has written. Shut up Dhi! Teacher has trusted me with these. Add some good marks for me. Get lost all of you… What are you looking for? where is the Cuticura box? Why? I want it. That's what I am asking, why? Are you Madhu? Yes. Come, I need to talk to you. We can talk here. Not here. Come that side. Don’t, Madhu. Nothing to worry… I will be back in two minutes. Meera, I will leave. Please Jyo, wait with me here. It is getting late Meera. I will be yelled at by my father. My mother too. Why am I to suffer because of you both? I get scolded for no reason. What happened, Madhu? Why did you tell them about me? Where did I tell? Then how did they get to know? I didn't sign up for this when I fell for you. I didn't need this. Did I? What did I do, Madhu? Is it my mistake if they follow me? Yes, Madhu, she did not... You shut up. Madhu… Come let’s go. Let us leave it at this. Let us talk to your area boys. No man. Leave it. Can you stop and let me be? Just leave me alone. Hey… Don’t you want the Cuticura box? In cinema, the hero beats up the villains… but my hero had been beaten up. Him saying ‘Let us leave it at this’ disappointed me. But I later realized, that he grew deeper into me.. since then. It is easy to take a bunch of boys and indulge in a fight. But to let things go is difficult. Especially for boys. The same irresponsible attitude would have irritated me earlier. *Note: I have not studied Ding, please pass me* But then... Was I making him lazy with my pamper? I don't know. I couldn't help it but. *Auto Caption: Loving Boy, Cheating Girl* I don’t know what happened during that fight. But after that incident, the auto boys... ...stopped following me. Bro, what happened? Nothing. I will go to class and be back. He doesn’t know yet? Sometimes you fight and sometimes you talk... It is beyond my understanding. Bro, have you kept the money safely? Yes bro. I had to beg and cry before my dad for it. That's why! I am getting scared. It was the first time I skipped class to watch a movie with friends. DDLJ movie had released. It was the second time for all of us. Yet, we all wanted to watch it again. 6 Balcony tickets. Haven’t you gone to the school? It’s a holiday. Why? Chairman died. Which school? Ahhhh…Saint... Meera's... Seats are not together. Good, give. *Film playing in the theatre* Sorry. Are you ok? Go check once Meera. Your lips are so chapped. Apply some lip balm. A secret gift from our secret world, Just OURS. Just US. How was the film? It was good. Amazing, isn’t it? Hey, we will go to bathroom and join you. Will you come along? See you in the classroom later. Ok, bye. Bro, Kajol... Who Kajol? That thing which apply to your eyes... Hey shut up man, don't tease... What's up Madhu? Your lips are swollen? Nothing man, just... They had corner seats as well... Hey Ding. Hey...What happened? How did they get to know? What? I didn't say anything. This idiot Prajwal.... Hey... Why do boys share everything with their friends? Bloody hell. It was our moment! *On Desk: Dagar (Slut)* Dagar (Slut) *On Desk: Dagar (Slut)* Why are you guys doing this to her? How does it concern you? She will feel hurt. Then what...? She took the rose from our boy and now roams with Madhu. How can we tolerate? It has been two years since she took rose Babu. So what if it is 2 years? She likes him. She took rose from me as well, isn't it? Shame on me for talking to you. Come, Meera. Get lost. What were you talking to them? Just keep walking. Jyo, What does 'dagar' mean? Meera, just walk silently. Are you leaving as soon as the bus arrives? Yes. Aren't you? Won’t you come with us even today? The class was too long today. Meera is standing there. Where bro? Slut. Where is your slut bro? *News playing in TV* Won’t you change your clothes Meera? I will ma. First, you tell me. I need to complete homework too. He was a good orator. He would mesmerize people with his speeches. World war occurred because of him. Millions of them died. What he did was wrong, isn’t it ma? The whole of the world knows it as wrong. But what can be done? Hunger for power makes one do things. "Dagar dagar" (Song playing) "Dum dum dagar dagar..."(Song Playing) "Dagar dagar" “Dagar Dagar...Dum dum dagar dagar…” What kind of lyrics are they writing? Won’t they know it affects children? The world of cinema is getting corrupted. That is when I understood the meaning of that word. What had I done...so wrong, to be called like that? Bro, see there.... Slut. How much ever she washes, nothing is going to change. He said he loved me. Is this what love means in his dictionary? Just because things didn't unfold the way he wanted to.. it makes me a prostitute, is it? Why are these guys here? It seems she was staring this morning… Yeah. Who, bro? There will be such sluts man.... They keep signaling through their eyes. Hey, Babu, Why are you doing this? Why, Raju? You go man, mind your business. He always tries to interfere. Questions everything. How should it matter to him? He thinks he is a loyal friend. Abdul, aren't you coming with us? Wait, I will join. Madhu, come this side, I need to talk. Tell me here, it’s ok. Come to the sides, please. What is with this secret bro code? Whatever it is, utter it here Abdul. Alright bro. In the boy's toilet, it's written Meera equals Slut. Where are you going? Don’t you want to do something? What can I do? What do you expect from me? If someone says something, don’t you know who you are? What can I do? Go fight. In the movies the hero protects the heroine. But this boy… It is my battle. Mine alone. Slut. Slut. There are such sluts bro... Why is it bothering me so much? That word. What is there in it? If someone says something.... don't you know who you are? Not possible for 50 rupees. See. It dawned on me suddenly. The word after all means a prostitute... that's all, isn't it? Isn’t it a profession for some? Whether they like or not, for a livelihood they have do it. Isn't it? Why should that word become a curse word? Who are these to call me so? Let us finish it today. I have got sketch pens. We need to outline it with different colours Bro, how was it to fall on your dagar? They are so cheap. In the english debate competition, our last participant is Meera Deshpande from 10th 'B' Section. Bro, your slut is going. Won't you wish her all the best? I will be happy if she loses. You were too good Meera! You were super! What? They want to cancel their bet. What bet? With whom? Madhu had a bet with them saying you would win. Debate competition results are with me! I am really curious, are you? Let’s see who the winner is. It's my favourite Meera Deshpande from 10th B section. Give her a big round of applause! *Folk mystical song in praise of Lord Shiva* It was my first school excursion. I went out of the city with Madhu for the first time. Although the place mattered less, I did want to learn more about the place. But he would divert my attention to something else Ancient temples of Somnathpur Sand dunes of Talakadu were a silent witness to our tender yet passionate love. "This earth is blushing" "That sky is swaying" "Steaming teenage" "Dripping romance" "Blossoming Lovers" "Stones are melting" Does anyone need water? Take it, Madhu. Madhu is always late isn't it? Meera? Some more? Enough? Shall I serve some more? Some more? Serve them soup. May we come in, sir? Come, sit. Please sit Enjoyed the trip? I like you both as a couple. Thank you, sir. You do know you are my favourite student, right? The entire school has pinned hopes on you. Sir… What year are you in now? Tell me? Board exams. Just two months away from the exams. Please concentrate on your studies. Two months is a lot, sir. Will prepare well. Don't worry at all. Marks are not showered from the sky, Madhu. Be serious. After you graduate, you can marry, you both. Marriage? If you get a good job, it will make life easy for you two. Give it a thought. You guys need to slow down. If something goes wrong, it will affect you more than him. Right? Go, all the best. Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir Bye, sir. We can easily prepare well, isn't it? I wasn't sure why he said what he said. But I didn't want to disappoint him or anybody else. Meera sister… Where is the chocolate? Has someone called? I don’t know. Hey, tell me, is there a call? All I need is a chocolate. Just come fast. Hi, uncle. Did you have lunch Uncle? Yes kid, I did, did you? Not yet, uncle Hello? Why haven’t you eaten yet? I was solving old question papers. Will go eat now. It’s a week since we met Ding, Since study holidays started, you have not stepped out of the house. How do we survive like this? I will come to the library tomorrow. Whenever you speak from home, you seem like a different person. Uncle is close by. Can’t hear. Idiot. Will meet you tomorrow. Bye. Thank you, uncle. It's ok. Welcome. Since it is exam time, friends call… Yes, I understand. Study well. Bye, uncle. Sister, my chocolate? You shouldn’t eat chocolates kiddo. Your teeth will get infected. I am not going to major in Science next year... I just decided. Even I don't want to. I wish to major in Arts and study Psychology. Will your mother agree? No way. My parents see only engineering as an option for me. Nobody is watching. You were saying something about equal and opposite reaction… Focus on studies… Madhu, concentrate. I am. You continue. How do we study like this? What can I do? When I am with you my hands refuse to listen to me. Exams are nearing. Let us not meet from tomorrow. Would that be easy? I feel like dying when I don't see you. Then? I don’t know. Shall we go for a movie? Baby, we have exams next week, have you forgotten? No. Even I am trying for higher studies. But at home, they say enough of studies. Don’t know what to do. Get married. That is my fear too. My father has been looking for groom from many years. You people are laughing? I will try to join Christ College. I will join diploma. I will make money faster. My dad says diploma holders do not have status. Let him think. Let us elope and get married. Who will marry you? You wait and see, I will be the one for you. What about you, Madhu? I will join where my girl will join. First let him get his hall ticket. Why will I not get it? Bro, what will you do now? I have spoken to my cousin. He said he will help me out. Let's see. Let us leave if you are done. Crowd would be less near the counter. Ok, finish up with the cigarette fast. We didn't realize that those were the last days of school. I sort of knew things won't remain the same. But didn't know how different it would be. Students, just focus on your own booklet, need not look here and there. I had forgotten whether I had started liking Madhu because of Salman or I like Salman now because of Madhu. I couldn’t stick Madhu’s photo. So... Bro, I will surely pass says this flower. Do you have to go? He wants me to go to my uncle's village and learn some work. I can't say no, isn't it? Whatever... Do what you wish. I promise I will call you from there. Two months, Madhu! I will write letters daily and send it by pigeons, ok? *Sings song* Bye. Hey Ding... What happened to her man? Meera...Meera... Please don't get angry. Come back. Come ding, it was such a small... See, they have planned some things for last day... Meera. Wake up baby. It's already 9 in the morning. One shouldn’t sleep for so long. It is inauspicious. Did you wake up? I have cooked. Do have lunch. Don’t forget. I am leaving. I didn't know I will have to be without Madhu like this. I didn't know there would be a day when I don't get to see him. *Wall graffitti: Madhu Tailors* How do I live without him? Was it even possible? I didn't know. That is when I got introduced to loneliness. That is when I realized how deeply he had rooted within me. Every passing moment was heavy. Every breath of mine longed for him. Not a single phone call did I get from him. Didn't he ever remember me? That's when I realized, we experience only our own feelings. That is our only truth. We can only understand others feelings and thoughts, but can't experience them. He said he loved me. Is this what love means to him? Is he able to stay without talking to me for so long? Did he forget me? Meera! Congrats Meera. Thanks, Jyo. Congrats, Meera. Thanks! Hmm...Ma.... Congratulations, Meera! Eighty nine percent. Very good. Keep talking, I will meet the Principal and be back. Where is Madhu? He is there. Hi. How are you? Sorry Ding. Couldn’t call. Phone lines in our village were disrupted. I failed, Meera. Don’t know how. I had done well in all the subjects. But this one... Look at this man. He copied my answers but he passed. You will pass in the re-exams, don't worry. Yes, I will clear it then. Hey, congrats, You have topped. Isn’t it? Mom will create drama. How do I go home? Dad will for sure…kill me. I am not that dumb, am I? I will pass in re-exams. Won't I, Meera? I missed you Meera! Nobody is to be seen? Did you skip the class? Don’t skip too many classes. Else you will become like me! Where do we sit? Come here. It’s empty here. It was different meeting him outside school. Our worlds had changed. But he was still the emperor of my world. Cauliflower fry. Also one fried rice. Then, what else? What else? We met just the other day. What's up with you? Its all a bit strange Ding. I am unable to understand anything. How did you become a topper despite being with me? I am not worthy of you, isn’t it? I am a loser who repeats exams. And you are highly intelligent. Wonder why you fell for me? If I remember what is taught in the class, is it my fault, Madhu? I didn't like you because of your marks sheet. What else did you see? Why are you talking rubbish? Sorry. I said sorry. Hi Ding. Who were they? Area boys. They look like goons. Yes. Are you here from a long time? Look here. What do I do sitting at home? I get bored. All my friends go to college. If you get bored, I will give you my books, Study them. Show off? That you are senior to me in studies? I am stupid..and I should study for next year from now on!!? Where did I say that, Madhu? What else? At home, mom tortures me. Here, you do the same. Madhu, stay back. I can't stay home or come here. She also says the same things. If study from now, will I become a genius? As though getting good marks was my crime, he would taunt and hurt me at every occasion. Such moments, I wanted to embrace him like a child and protect him from the world. But he was making it very difficult. There is an english essay as well We just have a day off, I'm not going to finish it. Shilpa, you carry on, see you later. You are hurting me. Let's go study. Just a minute. Now. I will join some other college. It won't be nice to be your junior in the same college. It will be sexy... to have an affair with a junior? It makes me feel like a big girl. Yes, madam. You are a big person. Where you are and where am I? No, Madhu. Don't go on that tangent again! No, sweetheart. Here. Focus this side. What? Let’s ask for revaluation. Why? You have failed by four marks. I was confident of clearing it this time. Am I this stupid? All because of you. I was fine before you came into my life. What did I do, Madhu? Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean that. You are the best gift from life. I don't know. My father… mother… My Sister.. ...she doesn't even respect me. Madhu, please. Please don't cry. Da...... Dad, this morning, happily.... was filling my application for a Diploma. Madhu, please! Let's send it for revaluation, You will clear it for sure. Do you remember? Our Principal would always say, if you get first class, you will get first class life. If you get second class, second class life. If you fail... Madhu, why are you taking him seriously? I have failed again, Meera! Don’t leave me. I am right here. I am not that stupid Meera. Will you be fine? Yes Ding. You Go. It's ok. Shall we call Dheeraj? Hey, No. I will manage. Shall I come home with you? What will you say coming home? Shall I introduce you as their daughter in law? I love you. So much. Take care. See you tomorrow. Pull it. Yes sir, wait, I am pulling it. Careful with the antenna. It belongs to our neighbour. Yes, I know. Or else they will quarrel. I will take care of it. Do your work properly. Kiddo! Hey kiddo! Done with classes for the day? How is it? We got a new phone at our place. Share the number with all your friends. Ok, pa. Don’t trouble the neighbours hereafter. Pull it…pull it…pull it… If we pull it further, wire will break. We have waited for three years for this phone. Ok, ok fine. *Phone rings* Hello? Hello? Who is it kiddo, at this hour? I don't know. Must be a cross connection. You sleep. Why are you up so late? Ma, you have forgotten to light the stove. Hello? One minute. Meera, you have got a call. Did you see, Archana? Home? Already boys have started to call. Ok, I will come. Need to be careful henceforth. Does he stay so far? Yesterday I told him that I will come home, he said no. Today he has asked you to bring me along. Off late I am not able to understand him. I feel strange Dhee. Wonder what his parents will think? Tell him I will meet him tomorrow. But Meera... We finally got it after three years of wait. How much did it cost you? 280 rupees was installation charges. It seems they add some charges in the first bill. Pratima, You dance well isn’t it? Ma’m, I am not interested in competitions. Why? Ma’m… Meera, what happened? How can he go like this? How could he become so selfish? Dad, Mom, Sister... Did he not think of any of them? Was he so weak? Just because of an exam result? Why did he do this? Where did he go to? What does death mean? He said he loved me! Had he loved me, would he have left me? Just like that? I need to talk to him Right here, right now. Just once. I want to touch him. Madhu. While going... he took me with him in many ways... Many a times I contemplate killing myself too, but I can’t. I will keep breathing until I have to. That's it! it is in the newspapers, see. Is this what you were talking about? Yes. What, Meera? Meera, you came so early. I can’t even cry. If I cry, I am scared that I will lose him with tears. I want him.. He should be here within me like this, Safely! Meera… Meera… Pass. Don’t you want to check yours? Meera? Can we go for coffee? I have been asking you for three years. Today is our last day. Please? Somebody tried to invade in to my privacy, that didn’t kill me. Somebody tried to invade in to my self respect, that didn’t kill me either. HE He invaded my soul, churned everything!! This wouldn't kill me either, I guess. How I wish I walk down now and I see you there standing and smiling… It would be perfect! Impossible, isn't it? You are the baggage of my soul. Carrying it gracefully, is all that I can do! Till I am here... Even after! This life, why is it like this? Is it real or an illusion? I can’t comprehend. I feel so FULL And so EMPTY all the time.
