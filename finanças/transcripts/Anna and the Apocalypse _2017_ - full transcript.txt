Subtitles by explosiveskull We interrupt this program to bring you an important news bulletin. The Center for Disease Control has recategorized the pandemic first thought to be a super virus strain of the flu. It has now been determined to be a lethal pathogen seemingly capable of reanimating... Have you got your ticket for tonight? Dad, I told you, I've got work. You deserve a break, love. I don't need a break. You won't be saying that next year when it's wall-to-wall lectures. You heard back from art school yet, John? Uh, no, not yet, Mr. Shepherd. Is that normal? - Dad! - Sorry! I'm sure it'll be fine. Hey, why don't you bring Anna to the Christmas show tonight? I'm working! So is he. John, you tell him! She can't, she's got to pay off that ticket. John! What ticket? You said, "Tell him!" - I didn't say tell him that! - What ticket? - It's nothing. - Anna! I'll tell you about it later. What ticket, Anna? Just... I'm going on a trip, all right? - When? Where? - Dad. Well, I hope you checked when university starts, because... I'm not going to uni! I'm gonna travel first. Just for a year, or maybe... Don't be so stupid! See you inside. Thanks for the lift, Mr. Shepherd. You know this is going to hold you back. Where are you gonna go? Australia first. The ticket's open. Oh, well, that's all right if it's open, eh? Think of all the beautiful places you could get mugged or killed. Stop trying to run my life. I'm not a little girl anymore. Well, stop acting like one! If your mother could see you now... I can't wait to get away from you. Anna. My parents went to Mexico, so I'm all alone. I just thought it would be nice to spend Christmas as a couple. That's fine. It's fine. Forget it. My holiday gift donation. Wait! Sorry! Don't! I got it. Do you need a hand with these, Steph? No, my car's right outside. I guess we're all having a good day. You all right? Never seen your dad like that before. You think I'm doing the right thing, yeah? Yeah, it's great. Anyway... P.E. is calling. Yeah! More snowflakes! That picture's not straight. Drawing pin missing, bottom left-hand corner. Miss North! Dropped the homeless story. It's editorial. You can't do that. It's a school blog, Miss North, not The Times. Council sets our budgets, so we play nice. Hopefully, get some new computers. With all due respect, Mr. Savage... I'm gonna go to Mr. Gill. - Be my guest! - Cool! Headmaster Gill is all but gone.

Please try to remember that a hand sanitizer is your friend. Kissing on the mouth is not... Your friend. You two! Why aren't you up on stage? I'm not in the show. Ah, Miss Shepherd. Your father is doing my lights. When he has finished cleaning the toilets, would you send him my way, please? - That's not his job! - Anna! It will be soon. Now where is my magician? Here, sir! I think it's about time we had a little chat about health and safety. Everybody up on stage, please. Now! No, no, no! Get back on stage this minute! Flightless chancers! You are such a child. A sexy child. Wait, no. Goodbye, Nick! Hey. Come on, come on. Don't be like that! Look. If you wanna hook up over the holidays, then... Skip off. Savage is losing it. He made Henry Lee cry 'cause he can't breakdance. Henry Lee has a prosthetic. And he only has one leg! Hey, guys! Yay! Boyfriend! Ignore him. Ugh. He's such a prick! I mean, yeah, he's got a body you could - lick chocolate off but you'd have to have... - Mmm-hmm. ...like, no self-respect to even think... I mean, um... Not you, obviously! The others! Not that there's been loads, you know, it's probably all just rumors anyway. I mean, love me! Hey, guys! Chris. Uh... I need you to film something. Yeah? Cool. I'll film anything. Savage keeps screwing with the blog. So, um, I wanna bypass the school completely and do a video. Uh... If we go to the soup kitchen tonight, I can have it in before Christmas and actually show people we have a problem. No! It's the Christmas show tonight. And I'm doing a special song about Santa! Our teacher said you need something real. Um... This is real. I promise I'll make it back for your song and Gran will be there. She's really excited to see you, Lis. All right. Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! Cool. Yeah, um... Let's see that asshole try and stop this one! Uh... Bye. Oi, Annie Lennox! Right. I'm going over there. Power down your lasers, Iron Man! He doesn't have lasers! They're repulsors. Well, Nick doesn't need help being any more repulsive. Plus, you know it's not like you could actually do anything. Hey, did you guys hear what happened in science? Oh, my God!

That guy's a zombie! There's no such thing. Right, because that's perfectly normal! I can't believe this is happening. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. Use your inhaler. When was the last time you saw me with an inhaler? Don't have a go at me, just because I said, "Use your inhaler." Because there's zombies! That's stupid! I never saw my mum this morning. Did you see your dad? I should have just gone to the show. I bet they're still at the school. Shit! Maybe the Internet's still working. But we can't go all the way home. Do you still have your work keys? Come on. Maybe it won't be so bad across town. Potassium. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Our parents will know what to do. That's enough! Now, even though we had to spend the night in the school, be assured, the government will sort all this out. We have an army base, literally on our doorstep. All that is required of us is that we remain calm and patient. If anyone has any further questions, I've set up temporary office space over there, adjacent to the fridge. I'll get someone. Doctors can't fix it, dear. Don't think your teachers could do much. I'm just worried about Christopher. He's seen, like, every horror movie. He'll know what to do. Go. See? - Told you it was them! - Have you been bitten? - Show me! - They're fine! Hey, guys! Did you guys break in? Uh, the back door was unlocked. That's the cleaner's job! Oh. Although, she might have been concussed. So, uh... We were out filming the soup kitchen last night. It was really good, and then we... Then somebody screamed. Yeah. Hey, zombies, right? It's crazy! I know! Excuse Anna. She's in Egypt at the moment. Because she's so far in denial! You're not funny. Oh! - Boom! - You guys heard anything? Further updates now on the unfolding global crisis. Reports of mass infection with the as-yet-unidentified virus continue to come in from across the world. - Sources at the UN... - Whatever. Big firm has been doing weird shit for years. It's a cover up. ...historic proportions. Further information and details of the evacuation program can be found on social media. Yeah, once it's safe, we're supposed to go to the school. So the school's okay? Yeah. And the army's going to escort us out. How cool will that be? - Shit! - What? Justin Bieber's a zombie! Also, search "#EvacSelfie." - Look. - Oh, no! Well... We all deserve to go extinct. Oh! Bollocks! He's definitely a zombie. Robert Downey Jr. has, like, a bazillion dollars. He is in a hot tub right now surrounded by electric fences and models! Yeah, but, it just takes one personal trainer with a bite and then... Uh-uh. Iron Man lives! What about Ryan Gosling? Doesn't matter. Alive? Dead? The guy's still cool! Yeah. Um... Taylor Swift? Jesus, Chris! Why would you even say that? Tay Tay's fine! Yeah, all right, I was just... She's fine! Do you think Paris is still standing? Yeah. French don't take no shit! Mrs. Hinzmann? Um... No! They're inside! - John? - What do I do? What do I do? Destroy the brain like in the movies! Get behind the table! Go, on three! Three! Two! I said "after three!" You said "on three!" Think about your words! "Think about your words!" Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Can you... Can you understand me? Okay. Yeah! Boom! Mr. Savage? Is... Is there anything we can give Bea? Am I supposed to know who that is? It's just 'cause she's got a bad heart, so... Look around you, Miss Snow. What do you see? Um... Tables? I see civilization on the edge.

We're a lot of things, Nick, but we've never been a team. Hey... It wasn't me, you know. That night you stayed at mine. I didn't say nothing to no one. Wait. You think that's why I'm angry with you? Yeah, obviously. Nick, I don't care about the sex. I'm angry with you because we shared all that stuff about our future, and you acted like it meant something, and then you just dumped me! I trusted you. Oh. That's it? You are such a prick. Hey, look. Just 'cause your little fuck buddy died, don't go taking it out all on me. Don't you dare talk about John! What have you ever done that wasn't just about yourself? Killed my dad. He got bit. So he gave me the bat and he said, "Don't you let me down, son. For once." So I... Fuck.
