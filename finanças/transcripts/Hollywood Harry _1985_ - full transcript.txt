Listen... this won't do any good. You'll never understand me but I'll try once, and give it up. When a man's partner is killed he's supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him he was your partner and you're supposed to do something about it. And it happens we're in the detective business. My uncle's a real detective. He lives in Hollywood. He's a lot like Humphrey Bogart. WOMAN: Are you alone, honey? Yeah. MAN: L.A. Express. That's my bus. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HARRY: Things hadn't been goin' so good. I hadn't had a decent case in months. My partner Max was renting out the side office again and our secretary Candy was the only one with money, it was humiliating. I took a powder. That was two weeks ago. Since then I've been boozing pretty good, and lately I've been having these crazy dreams. CUPID: Harry? Harry Petry. It's Cupid calling. HARRY: What do you want? CUPID: I've got another job for you, Harry. HARRY: Forget it. CUPID: You've been living alone much too long. HARRY: Oh, no, you don't. I'm not falling in love ever again. CUPID: Mmm, you need somebody, Harry. HARRY: You made me fall in love all my life and I got my ass kicked. CUPID: I, uh, I sent you June. HARRY: But you didn't let me keep her. CUPID: Oh, yes, wrong brother. But then I sent you Ramona. HARRY: She rearranged all my books by size. -CUPID: Oh. -HARRY: Tough? Between her and Hitler it was pick 'em. CUPID: I'm gonna have to call the boss. HARRY: Call him. This isn't a dream, this is a nightmare. [THUNDER RUMBLES] BOSS: H.P. HARRY: Yes, Boss. BOSS: It's your nature to fall in love, do as your told. HARRY: Yeah. But, Boss, you made my nature to fall in love with women, plural. BOSS: That's right, Harry. [LAUGHS] I'm in trouble. I'm in big trouble. [OBJECTS CLATTER] This is silly. This is terrible. This is just awful. All right.How do you get her out of here? Think of something smart. I'm throwing up. I don't know who you arebut you're gonna have to leave, -I'm throwing up. -Hi, Petry. It's me, Betty Anne. Well, you're just gonna have to leave. Oh, is my time up? It's past time. Oh, I'm not on overtime, am I? No. But, uh, you're just gonna have to leave, and don't scare the goldfish. BETTY ANNE: I don't see any goldfish. They probably got scared and left already. Right there. Right where you're looking. Right there. BETTY ANNE: I can't find my dress. You're dress is right here. I didn't know a man like you threw up. Yes, we do, every morning, regularly. Oh, don't do that. I hate barf. My favorite place to throw up is right where you are standing. Well, jeez baby, I'm hurrying as fast as I can. I can't find my panties. [DOOR SLAMS] Never, never, never, never, never gonna drink. No more, no more, no more. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] Oh, Petry. It was just as terrific as you said it would be. Oh, and, uh, here's your five dollars. I know I'm only from Cleveland, but five dollars doesn't seem much for a rootin' tootin' first class Hollywood stud. Oh, and I will give your number to all my girlfriends like you asked. Except I don't have many, see, I haven't been in Hollywood very long. Lucky me. -BETTY ANNE: Hmm? -I say, uh... you better leave now. It's professional protocol. Oh. Okay. [SIGHS] BETTY ANNE: Hey, I've got it. I'll write your namein all the girl's bathroom walls in Hollywood. [GIGGLES] No, no, no. You'll be famous, Petry. [GIGGLES] Don't do that. Don't do that. I just loved it. Time's up. Hey, you're funny, you know that? What the heck, I think you're worth it. Twenty percent is pretty generous too. In Cleveland ten percent is tops. Goodbye, lover boy. I won't forget my promise. [GIGGLING] HARRY: If that was Cupid's idea of a joke, I wasn't laughing. I'd rather have been out on the street with Max and Candy tricking some poor guy and to accept in a subpoena. CANDY: How do we get Petry to come back? Don't ask me, buster. Wear a hula skirt and do a rhumba? MAX: That's clever. CANDY: You drove him away with your schlock jobs, you get him back. I'm on sabbatical. MAX: I thought men were you're business. CANDY: Oh, they are in a way. The abominable darlings. But as far as Petry is concerned, you're the one who needs him. Not me. She drank all my booze. She owes me more than six bucks. MAX: Do you think I need Petry for this job? I need Petry? I don't need him. I taught him everything he knows. I'm the master. He learned from me. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Hi. Are you a-comin' or going? Working. What's the going rate? For me, a trip to the moon. For you, I don't know. You'll have to ask the judge. Oh, no, you don't. It wouldn't [INDISTINCT] even for a little... front door, back door. Nice going, master. -He caught me by surprise. -Oh. Please, Candy, please. He won't listen to me. He'll listen to you. So, who says he'll listen to me? The man is impossible. -And you love it. -Hah. Anyways, forget it. The last time you sent me after him, we started a dance, he make some miserable face and a rotten crack about fig leaves and walked off the dance floor. MAX: You've been reading too much. I could've punched him right in the eye. Damaging his brain. CANDY: It's completely humiliating. HARRY: Oh, give me a break. Damn. [SIGHS] Not bad. She stole my bottle. Oh, she took the damn bottle. SALESMAN: Trust me.This is a big deal, a big steal. SALESMAN: That's a cool player, beautiful. Yeah. SALESMAN: --of quality merchandise and a price so low, you can't beat it anywhere. Well, it's a kitchen penbut it has a blade attachment... SALESMAN: ...merchandise. and a price so low... [BELCH] God Almighty. You light that up, I'm not buying you breakfast. MAX: You wouldn't say that if H.P. wanted to smoke it. H.P. has too much class to do that to a lady. MAX: Well, I have class, too. CANDY: Relax, Max,don't take this morning so hard. You know I'm used to seeing you run over. Your moral fibers belongin a box of health food cereal. No wonder you and H.P. like each other. He just helps me keep rotten every now and then. I like that. My name is Gene Perrotta. We got a hell of a product here. -It's proven. -It slices, it dices. Just wait until he finds out about our new court case. He'll come begging back on his knees. I'll say no, no, no. GENE: My name is Gene Perrotta. What the hell do you want? Excuse me, uh, Mr. Caldwell. Can I have the key to the men's room? Have you filled your quota? Uh, not yet. But I gotta go real bad. Well, too bad. Not until you fill your quota. Get out! You wanted two weeks, Candy. I've seen Petry go on some pretty big binges. But baby, if you ask me, this is the worst. Two weeks. Oooh. I would like to see his reaction to Regina. MAX: I sent him a client. He wanted one, I sent him one. Then you'll do it? Not a chance. You know what he's like when he gets like that. Cute. What's this? A parachute? Hello Jimmy. Much better. Much better. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Hit it again, it'll fall down. I won't have to get up. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] I'm coming. Yummy, yummy pizza. Wise guy, huh? How refreshing. [SNIFFS] I said no anchovies. No, pal. You said no bell peppers. I took the order myself. You said you weren't through throwing up yet. You didn't like green surprises. Makes sense. How much? Five eighty-eight. -Keep it. -All of it? Don't be a smart ass. You're lucky to get the business. Your pizza stinks, smell it. I wouldn't eat that. That's the idea. Wh-what are you an actor or something? Yeah. Did you see me in my last show? -It was... -No. MAN: Shithead. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] I'm on my heels, I told you I'm broke. REGINA: So am I. HARRY: So am I who? So am I. Regina. Silly old me bought a coke with the extra. What extra? That your ex-partner gave me for bus fare to get here. Max. I can see you're a hot item. I don't suppose you'd just go away if I asked you. You, uh, you don't suppose correctly, Mr. Petry. Mr. Caldwell said that you were a very nice man. [SCOFFS] Oh, my. Nice, huh? Well, I've seen worse. Have a seat. Why, thank you very much. [GROANS] Pardon me? I say you don't look like a woman but you act like one. You are under age. Only in California. I could get in trouble. How theatrical. Listen, if you're trying to be suggestive, I want you to know I don't fornicate in the daytime anymore. It's bad for business. I'm not after you, Petry. I'm here to ask you to find my boyfriend. And he's not just a nobody. A somebody? Big guy? Producer maybe? You came to townto be the next blonde bombshell, only you're a brunette. You wound up making a dirty movie and clinging to a handful of promises. That's very good. How'd you know? I'm on a hot streak this morning. Three for three, I think. This is Hollywood, remember? I'm not the first then? Not the first this morning. What happened to the Southern accent? Well, sometimes I forget when I get excited. But I think there are some things -that you should know. -HARRY: No. I'll tell you. You want to get the dirty tape back, you're going home, you learned your lesson. Hollywood is filled with nothing but crooks and phoneys and credit stealers and self-enthusiasts. You don't have any money, but your daddy does. -How am I doing? -That jerk Caldwell told you everything. He didn't tell me a thing.It's written all over your face. Men like you just love that, don't you? Nice try, an eight maybe. You think you're so damn smart. How come you live like a pig in a stye? My daddy happens to raise pigs. I bet he does. As soon as I found that so called boyfriend of yours, you'd throw yourself on the ground at his feet instead of wanting to mix it up with me. He'd, "Oh, baby.". You right back into his arms. I'm not interested. I believe you are. You're wasting your time. I always get what I want, Mr. Petry. Always is not forever. Damn you! You were my last chance. The bottom of the barrel. And I came all the way over hereon a stinking bus. Furthermore, my daddy does happen to have some money and he can be mighty grateful to somebody who's good to his little girl. Or he can be twice as nasty when they're not. Well, I thought about it and I thought about it and I'm much too busy. Mmm, good. Oh, terrible. [PHONE RINGS] State your purpose. MAX: H.P., I got terrific news. My new case, you won't believe the luck, H.P. I fell right into it. Is Candy still picking up the bills, Max? MAX: Not for long, H.P. Listen, this new case will strike-- I don't want to hear it. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] People's Court? You are going on People's Court? I think I'll wear my navy blue serge suit. I'll have my tie pressed. I wonder if I should wear my glasses and-- or go for that rougher less intellectual look. What do you think, Harry? I think you should have gotten Candy to try to get me back, Max. You mean you don't like my People's Court case, Harry? It is beneath crapola! And I was gonna cut you in. Ingrate. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] HARRY: I wonder what I'd tell her. I wonder why I only charge five bucks? [SIGHS] [DOORKNOB RATTLES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] HARRY: ♪ She ain't got lose [INDISTINCT]♪ ♪ And you get to [INDISTINCT]♪ ♪ She ain't got lose [INDISTINCT]♪ CLAPPER: Ha. HARRY: ♪ ...lose [INDISTINCT]♪ BOTH: ♪ When your mouth says don't you [INDISTINCT]♪ MAN: ♪ Swallow it like...♪ [YELLS] Ow. [BOTH SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] What the hell do you want? Right in the beak. -Don't kill him, Clapper. -All right. Look, guys, I think I got that out of my system. Why don't we talk some business? [GROANS] Boss said don't kill him, Clapper. Don't kill me, Clapper, the boss. CLAPPER: Put some clothes on, you Hollywood fruit fly. You gave him a hand wash, eh, Clapper. -[CHUCKLES] -Yeah. All right, boys. I hope everybody had coffee while you were waiting. Everything all right? Oh, a carrot, that's good. Now, listen to me, honey. Clapper did not like what you did in there, -did you, Clapper? -No, sir. What have we got here, guys? A meeting of the Mensa Society? Now we're here on business. It looks like you ain't paying either. So cut out the tough guy crap. Okay, guys. I'm not tough. All business, you guys talk, I'll take notes. End of notes and the bullshit. Take your business up the street. Come on, move, boys, unless you want to look like boxes of cheerios. Out that door before I count to five. Beat it. One, two, three. Don't get nervous now. Don't shoot. Hey, don't shoot. Don't shoot. -Come on, Skeeter. -Don't shoot. Did you say four? Four! Bam, bam, bam! You dead! [LAUGHS] I got him. I got him, Clapper. CLAPPER: No, we didn't. I feel like I'm in a Hollywood movie show already. SKEETER: And he just got the Hollywood? Did you see his robe fly open? Yeah. -Boys! -[SKEETER LAUGHS] Now you listen up hog slop. You get yourself and this here hog pen cleaned up. You stay sober tonight. My boss raises souies, he don't socialize with them. Be here tomorrow morning at nine o'clock sharp. You be ready, you hear? That was a nice move, Crapper. I like that. Turkey breath. Crapper. [LAUGHS] You are dead. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] HARRY: It was turning into one of those times when nothing was going right. A time when a man needs to share a drink with his buddies. BARTENDER: Hey, boys. Look who's here, five-dollar Petry. [LAUGHTER] BAR PATRON: Hey, Petry, show us a trick. [LAUGHTER] HARRY: Taking that first five bucks was a big mistake. [ALARM RINGING] [ALARM RINGING STOPS] HARRY: Smashing the alarm clock hurt like hell. Not locking the door was just plain stupid. I told you to clean this hog stye up for good, boy. STINSON: Let the man up, Clapper. HARRY: Let me up. I said let the man up, Clapper. I don't know who you are but take your smelly baboons and get the hell out of here before I call the cops. I didn't leave that convention and fly all the way down here from Denver just to breathe that stinking L.A. air boy. You got about 30 seconds to present yourself decent. Petry. Ah, it's gotkind of a Hollywood ring to it, like a frog turned into a prince. Kind of hogshit that turns a young gals head. That's what crosses my mind when I'm feeling kind of hostile. You get my drift, boy? I got a loaded gun this time, Stinson. Get my drift? How many people old Clapper kill anyway, Skeeter? SKEETER: Oh, lots. STINSON: I know that, but how many? Lots. Close enough when you consider the source. He started his own graveyard. STINSON: I think Mr. Petry gets the idea. Now, look here, Petry. I want my little gal back and I want her damn fast. You get my drift back, boy? I don't know what the hell you're talking about, Stinson. I don't know this girl. Well, now, that's mighty strange because when she called all crying and spirit-broken why it was your name and the phone number and address she left as to how to get in touch with her. Now let me just jog your memory. Regina? Regina? I'm going to kill you, Max. Now I want that goddamn movie show if like you say there is one. But what I really want is that so-called Hollywood producer. And I want my little girl and I get what I want. Now you know this town and I don't, so like it or not, you are interested. HARRY: Not for sale. [FINGERS SNAP] Still not interested. STINSON: Oh, I think you are. See, I'm a very wealthy man. I can afford to let old Skeeter here wipe Clapper's' can with hundred dollar bills. -Hey! -Shut up! And there's an additional five grand in cold un-taxable cash right behind that. Ten thousand, that's my price. Your price is five cents. [SKEETER LAUGHS] But five's a fair figure. And my handshake is my word. Damn. You shake hands like a fairy. [SKEETER LAUGHS] That's disgusting. Now Clapper and Skeeter will be around to check up periodically. In the meantime, we're going to have a little Arkansas style look see around on our own. Boys. Excuse me. Clapper. We're gonna be working together, right? I'd just soon not be part of that graveyard you got working. What do you say? Hmm. [GROANS] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAPPER SCREAMS] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Five thousand right down the toilet. No pun intended, Crapper. No more booze. No more booze. No more booze. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] It's after five, I'm not home. Is that you, Crapper? I'm real sorry about what happened this morning but, uh, that was my mean streakgot a hold of me. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] DANIELLE:Just open the door, Uncle Petry. Your niece Danielle. How many nieces you got named Danielle anyway? Uh, just one. But, uh... Yeah, what, did you forget? No. No, I didn't forget. But, uh... I don't want to talk about it right now, okay? But why aren't you in New York? Where's your folks? You mean your brother and my mother? Yeah. This place smells like a whiskey cellar. Don't change the subject. They're gone. What do you mean gone? What does gone usually mean? Gone usually means somebody is dead. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't come in here in the middle of the night and tell me that your parents are dead. I live with you now, there's no one else. That doesn't make any sense. Why didn't anybody tell me? DANIELLE: You never answered. I got a machine when nobody's here. Oh, what did you expect? It was only two and a half days. I was in school. What do you care anyway, Uncle Petry? You never wrote, you never called, you never answered any of my letters. One, yes, I did. Yeah, like you were writing to a baby, and I'm not a baby anymore. I'm almost 15 years old. [SIGHS] I'm so tired. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MAX: Hi, sports fans. This is Max the Swell Caldwell. Oh, Christ. MAX: If you were calling for my has been ex-partner Harry, I'm sorry to have to tell you but he died, and his body was sent to Stuartville, Ohio. He was swallowed whole by his own liver which also ate most of Rochester. I'm also sorry that you had to talk to a recording but I'm wanted downtown. -[PHONE BEEPS] -That was cute, Max, but this is a message for Candy. Candy, I need you immediately. Clean up your mind, that's not what I meant. A couple of things have come up here that, uh, put me in a hell of a bind and I'm desperate. I need you to babysit. I'm serious, I'm not kidding. There is some good news, I got the money for your back pay but the bad news is, this is the only way you're gonna get it. The back pay I mean. I love you, goodnight. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning. It's good, huh? My hangover prescription is 30 hard pushups, in and out of a cold shower, and a plate of bacon and raw eggs. After your first hangover, you will kill the first 14-year-old that says anything like that to you. Hmm, I doubt it. I'm a totally non-violent person. And as you can see, I've been trying to put your note together. You're a thrill a minute. Don't you know it's just moments after dawn? No, in fact it's uh... -10:30. -10:30. I've been trying to figure this out. And I've decided that it's some kind of top secret information like from the government or the military or something like that, and its written in code in some kind of invisible chemical and it was something so important that you tore it upand threw it in the wastebasket where no one would ever find it. And when you needed it, you and you alone would be able to dig it out and put it back together. That's amazing. Yeah it was, wasn't it? Amazing, but stupid. What's this crap? You're asking me? I thought you'd be an expert in pain killers by now. Is this a love note? Hey, what's this written in? No, its business, eyebrow pencil, and I don't use this. Eyebrow pencil? It's hard on the system. And it's not a love note? Tearing it up was pretty stupid. I make every mistake I can think of. Experience yields information, you can't learn less, you must learn more. That's the philosophic foundation for learning "whole truths". Sounds to me like you wish you hadn't torn it up. Well, that too. You know, heat might bring this off. Or lemon juice. Most off beat substances will come off with acid. Are you always this obnoxious? Don't knock it. It's one of my assets. Now what do you know about love? You're 14 years old. What the hell do you know about love? I'm almost 15 and I probably know more than you do. [SIGHS]Look I can take care of myself. I already had breakfast and you wouldn't have to worry about me hardly at all. I can cook and sew. I can even iron if I had to, and I cleaned up the place. Nobody cleans up after me. I clean up after myself. Well, you were doing a great job. Listen. We are gonna have to get one thing straight. You're not staying here. Now, I'm a single guy. I live alone and do what I want. I come and I go. If I want to bring a woman home, bingo. If I wanna drink all night, same thing. I'm not gonna change my life. What you do doesn't matter to me. I'm being nice right now. You gotta understand. I'm not really this nice. I'm awful. I'm cold. I don't care. I'm staying. You're not staying. Now, there must be somebody on your mother's side, I don't know who. But there's nobody on my side and look around. Is this a good place for a little girl to grow up? No. I thought about it last night and came to the conclusion and what I'm doing is right for both of us. I understand, that you used to be this. Look at you now. I don't want to stay here anyway. That's the spirit, kid. This was taken before you were born. Mom said you were special. HARRY: This was for a dance contest, 30s dance contest. I never dressed up like this. We'll try the lemon juice firstand if that doesn't work, we'll use heat while the paper is still wet and-- Did you hear me? I'm not a character out of some book. Hey, you can't help it. If you're a boozer, you're a loser. -Is that right? -Yeah, that's right. Well, it's for sure I'm not a goddamn saint. And I'm not gonna become one, not for you or anybody else. You want a story book character,read the comics. You want a selfish jack ass, that's what I am. Well, that's a new one on me. When you gonna eat? HARRY: If I feel like it. Yeah, when's that? Thursday? Don't touch anything. No problem. All right, you guys. It's Petry and Petry from now on. So, you better watch out. Mind your Ps and Qs. HARRY: No longer in service? Well, uh, is there a new number perhaps? Maybe unlisted? Service is cancelled? Hey, hey, can you tell me when that was? Thank you, operator. So, Michael and Jill were gone. I wondered whether the kid was anything like her mother. DANIELLE: Get me a donut. Thought you already ate. I'm a heavy hitter. Make it a ding-dong. Two. Two. Make it four. HARRY: But she deciphered the note which led me to Claudia. DANIELLE: What do we do when she comes? HARRY: We beat her up. You jive. See that girl over there? You behave like that? We haven't got any sun in New York. Women who don't think they're sexy enough, show it off the most. She's trying to get a good tan. She's trying to provoke every male in the vicinity. There's a rule about that. Never provoke a man you don't want chasing you. Of course, then there's your type. You'll do all right.We'll get you a no cut contract with the Dallas Cowboys or something. This kid Buddy Nickles, at school broke his arm trying to go over the top of the school swing. He said he'd kill himself if I didn't marry him. What did he need, a middle linebacker? No. He wanted to have a baby. [COUGHS] -I know all about that stuff. -[CLEARS THROAT] It wasn't like when you were growing up. Kids today know stuff. Claudia, Claudia. Uh, excuse me. Are you, uh, Claudia? -I don't want any. -Neither do I. -Is Regina home? -CLAUDIA: Who? -Regina. -Oh, Regina, that dizzy bitch. Peter dumped her. You two aren't with those movie people, are you? And what is this, kiddie porno? Watch what you say, Claudia. CLAUDIA: Oh, you're getting assertive, how butch. Imagine, they wanted me to be in that movie. Have you ever read such a pieceof junk in your life? Surely you didn't read it? You can imagine what they wantedme to do in the film. What do they think I am, a pervert or something? Ow. And, you know, Peter wrote it himself as if he could write his own grocery list. Twelve lines of dialogue and a much grunting and groaning. Can you tell me where I could find Regina? Uh, Peter then? Peter is running scared. He's lucky he's not up for statutory rape. As if he didn't know she was under 18. I'm sure his wife's got the mounted police out for him or something. I think she put up the money for the movie. He'll be lucky if he doesn't get his walnuts cut off. Oh, excuse me, hon. It's okay. I've heard fruits talk before. CLAUDIA: Are you two quite through? Uh, neighbor's kid, got stuck babysitting. CLAUDIA: That's what you get for fooling around with divorcees, hon. Would you like a lollipop, maybe some pablum? You'd make a cute little dike. -Fag. -Breeder. What happened to your hair, your vibrator explode? DANIELLE: Oh. Claudia, I gotta find Peter or Regina or somebody. I'm gonna be in some big hot water if I don't. Your big mouth cost me 50 bucks. That was mean. You'll wash dishes for a week then. You haven't got any dishes at your place. You don't like my place? Find some other place. I like it fine, Petry. You should, you got the bed. But you are always in the showertill all the hot water is gone. You're from New York and you're complaining about hot water. We got better cold hot water in California than you've got hot hot water in New York. Oh, we've got great hot hot water in New York. Pretty good cold hot water too. What are you so grumpy about? You're gonna have to spend the night at Max's house or something. Jeez, he's horny already. HARRY: At least that 50 bucks bought me the address of Peter's ex-wife. DANIELLE: Are you sure this is where he lives? Nope. I just figured it would be a good spot to park for a couple of hours. Bet you'd park with Buddy Nickles. I bet I wouldn't. You'd be French kissing all night long. Oh, forget it, man. Gee, this is fun. Patience is a virtue. Generally unachievable by the young. Well, that's good. You got two cents worth on life goals? Yeah. Arnold Toynbee a British historian, recently dead, said: A human being ought to be perpetually striving to overcome that innate propensity in him to try to exploit the rest of the universe. And should instead put himself at service to the universe. So unreservedly that his ego become identical with the ultimate reality, which is love, in case you wanted to know about that, too. Don't exploit, serve instead, that's love. I got it. You ought to lay that one on crapper. Or you could write it on the bottom of your feet. I thought when you are on a stake out, you stayed until the person showed up. HARRY: In the movies. Danielle. Who knows you're here? I can't just let you disappear. I gotta tell somebody. So, there's no one to know, I just left. We're gonna have to talk about this. I'm not ready. So who's Candy? She's a friend. DANIELLE: Do you love her? Candy and I know each other, we respect each other, we, uh, like each other, and once in a while we, uh, once in a while we dance. DANIELLE: Just answer the question. Do you love Candy? HARRY: Where is this conversation leading us? What is it, my sex life you're interested in? Sex, you want to talk about sex? All right. You want to talk about sex? You suggested it. Well, there's all kinds of sex to talk about. There's giving, taking, borrowed, paid for, sex over forty-- Sex over sixty, sex over eighty. I'm doing the talking. Maintenance sex, love sex? -Love sex? -Love sex? You want to talk about love sex? Well, all right. Picture this. A field full of butterflies. -What color? -Orange. Monarch butterflies, you got these two butterflies they don't know what's about to hit them. They see each other and like a couple of magnets. Boom. I love you. I want you, I need you. Let's become one. They fall in love. Which is all right for about a minute, but after the ether wears off, they got problems. Not the least of which somebody's got to lead. Both cannot. Now see if you can follow this. The first three rules of goodhuman relations are as follows. It is not a contest, it is not a contest, and it better not be a contest. Should I be taking notes on this or-- Yeah. Now I've had maybe 1185 fights with women. Well, no wonder. I lost them all. At this point in my life I am a champion. -Avoider of fights with women. -Ta da. But, if you like to dance and you take one out on the dance floor. And she insists on leading herself, impossible. That's love sex. Well, uh, I guess I knew all that. Well good. Next time we have a little chit chat -you can tell me more about it.-Oh probably. Yeah, in the meantime I'm gonnago take a long hot shower. Sounds to me like you need a long cold shower. You better learn how to follow,there aren't that many women around these days who know how to follow. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Petry and Petry. Just a moment. Does the five dollar special go for weekends too? -No, no, no, no. -No, I'm sorry. Just hang up, just hang up. What was she talking about Uncle Petry? Nothing. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Petry and Petry detective services. How may we service you? Service me? That's not bad. Where is the hairy beast anyway? Who am I talking to, please? This is Candy. Are you the babysit job? -Uh. -Is that Candy? What do you do that costs only five bucks anyway? I do nothing. Absolutely nothing that costs five dollars. Tell her I've died and they've sent my body to the University of Mamamlia. And get off the phone. Damn. DANIELLE: Are you still there, Candy? Yeah, what's going on? Petry told me to tell you that he died and went to the University of mam--mamory. What's that supposed to mean? What? Did lose the dough already? I really don't know, Candy. Uh, he didn't quite say. Well, that's cute. Real clever of him, don't you think? Why don't you give him this message for me. Why don't you tell Petry that he can-- HARRY: Bah da dum diddle dee dee. -Uncle Petry? -HARRY: Is it, Candy? -No. -HARRY: What? No. HARRY: Well, what then? -Nothing. -HARRY: Huh? Forget it I said. I'm breaking out in a rash on account of you. -Liar. -Liar? You wanna see take a look. No! HARRY: Let's take them. You go to the back door. I know karate so I'll kick the front door in. You'll have the gun don't shoot before you see the whites of their eyes. I'm close enough now, Petry. Give me the gun. Temper, temper, temper. Danielle, if you really think you've killed her there's only one thing you do, call the cops. I don't handle that kind of stuff. Stay here. -What's going on? -HARRY: Nothing. -Give me the gun, Petry. -HARRY: Stay there. Hello. What are you doing in front? The lawnmower is in the shed out back. Uh, no, no. Are you Mrs. O'Peters? Ms. Goldstein. You're forgiven. Does the name Peter Epstein mean anything to-- -You're not forgiven. -Oh. Ow! No. Don't. Ow! MARCY: I'm gonna call the police. I am the police. And I'm looking for your ex-husband, Peter or uh, or, uh uh, Peters-- Well, he is not here so you canput your mind at ease. Don't do that. And what if I do? I won't like it is what. When I tell you to do something,you gotta do it. Uh, it's my daughter. Her, uh--her mother is uh-- MAN: Marcy, Marcy. Go flex in front of the mirror, I'm busy. Is it gonna be all right? Sure I got another one. Listen, I don't know where that weasel is I could care less. If he ever comes around here again I'm gonna let Salvador break his legs. You might not need Salvador. Look, uh, you're not really a cop, are you? Didn't think so. Anyway that son of a bitch took my favorite Mercedes. I'll make a deal with you. What are you anyway? Uh, uh, private investigation. For who? Never mind, never mind it's not important. Look I'll tell you what you want to know, uh, if you return my Mercedes to me. And in exchange I'll give you $2,000? How am I doing? The foots feeling great. DANIELLE: What does she need help? You wouldn't have been it. Dammit Danny, if you can't learn to follow, if you don't do exactly what I tell you, you can't come with me anymore. Now I know you got some crazy little idea working in your mind, you want to be a partner. There's no such thing as a partner, that takes a long time. There's finesse, there's coordination, there's timing, there's little rifts, there's trust. If you don't have all that going for you when the action goes down, you blow it. What do you mean? Good cop, bad cop? Oh sure, good cop bad cop. Everybody knows good cop bad cop. I'm talking about stuffed riftslike uh, Murphey Kelly. -You know Murphey Kelly? -Yeah. -You do? -Yeah, and I do it subtle too without the strong accent. What's the matter with the accent? Everybody likes the accent. I do the accent, they all fall for the accent. -You do? -Yeah. Well, how do you know how to do Murphy Kelly? I read books. You read books? How about Lickity Split? You know Lickity Split? Hard Times Down At The Farm? Yeah. HBO cable man. You might not know it yet it's kind of new. Bop Diddely said hey, you know that? Do you? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. What the hell did you do to the car? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, oh. -What cops? No, worse. Clapper and Skeeter. Don't look back. DANIELLE: I thought they were on our side? HARRY: Well, not quite. SKEETER: I'm gonna get you fruit fly. [TIRE SCREECHING] [CAR HONKING] Did we lose them? HARRY: Yeah, we're losing them. Is Crapper gonna beat your brains in? Uh... DANIELLE: Can I watch? HARRY: I figured it was time to bring Max into the case. I had gotten the location of Peter the producer's porno film lab from Marcy, his ex-wife. Then I requested of Max one of his specialties, Sergeant Klinkscales. Oh no. Absolutely not. I get caught doing that again I'm gonna lose my license. No, no. -Think it's jaundice? -Uh-uh. What's jaundice? That yellow streak up your back. Oh yeah, very funny. Hey look, impersonating an officer is one of the most serious misdemeanors. You're just jealous because you don't get to go on People's Court. You're gonna be on People's Court? -You're gonna watch me kid? -Yeah. Can I come? You bet. HARRY: A Petry has class. Don't you ever forget it, Danny. Okay. I get the picture, Sergeant Klinkscales it is then. Oh, I gotta see this. Hey, stay right here. Fat chance Lance. HARRY: Hey. MAX: Why don't you ease up on the kid? She's got a lot to learn. For who? Mickey Spilane? Let her have some fun. This is only a push and shove case anyway. Yeah, but this is only a little game we play, Max. Nobody gets hurt. You get good at the game, you duck a few punches. MAX: Does she know that's all it is a game the two of you play? You don't see her cow towing to me, do you? You know I thought some of the old color was coming back into your face. Must be the booze. Booze, yeah, it's the booze. HARRY: Hey! She's not staying. She's not my kid. What can I do for you, sweetheart? It's not me it's my uncle Max. He's a cop. You're in deep shit buddy. -Well, uh-- -Step aside Danny. Good Afternoon sir, Sergeant Klinkscales. What's wrong? [CHUCKLES] What's wrong? Are you kidding? What's wrong? Did I do something wrong? Whatever it is, it ain't me. It's somebody else for sure. It's definitely not me I, not-- What? HARRY: Sergeant Klinkscales was a big hit. The Gaggle twins were like two bugs in a rug. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You guys want ding-dongs? No thanks. I'm gonna be in there a while. -I said no. Okay? -How about you Max? Shirley Temple in a giggle? No. Just get a big bottle. A very big bottle all right? Hey how's everything going? Petry giving you a hard time? No. We act like we fight, but we don't. It's not bad, so far. You are a Petry, aren't you? He doesn't want me around. Aw, don't be so sure. Look he's a private sort of a guy. It will just take him a little time to adjust, that's all. Yeah, I know. I got a problem Max. Well, you can talk to me. Not now, later. Thank you. Forward. [LAUGHS] HARRY: They sure were smug back there, but they had gotten the location of Peter the boyfriend. Max celebrated with a couple of snorts. He was no drinker. [SNORING] Guzzler. He's great. So, was the idea behind the Edsel. Uh-oh, duck. [MAX SNORES] Strictly business, lunch money for sleeping beauty. Do want to wake him up or do you want to sign it for yourself? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You're wearing that look. Got your dancing shoes? Toodle loo. HARRY: We got lucky. Peter and the Mercedes. -And one other thing-- -PETER: Oh, baby. HARRY: --Regina had caught up with him first. I wonder how that affected my options? All right. Wait a minute, wait a minute. How do you-- how do you know he was your father? I know my own father, don't I? Then who were those two guerillas that were with him? Those were his bodyguards, crackhead. -I knew it. You called him-- -I did not-- --you were a big baby. I knew you couldn't keep your big mouth shut. I knew it. I knew this is gonna happen. You called it. [INDISTINCT] REGINA: Why don't you just leave me alone? -I did not-- -PETER: Just like a woman, -can't keep your mouth shut. -REGINA: I didn't call him. You had to call him. HARRY: My options weren't getting any better. Daddy and his baboons were closing in fast, which meant that I had to move fast or kiss that 5,000 goodbye. Come on, Max, wake up.We're gonna go get the Mercedes. Where's Danielle? -DANIELLE: I'll drive. -Don't do that. -I'll drive. -Get in the car. Come on, Max, wake up. -Forget the Mercedes. -HARRY: Forget the Mercedes. Why don't we just kidnap her? Or A real detective would do it. HARRY: A real detective would be taking depositions for make believe automobile accidents, forget it. I'm telling you, it's crappy stuff. I'm not Humphrey Bogart. DANIELLE: I know. He was taller. Real detectives in New York. -Let's see what you did. See? -I did? -I have to play it dumb. -Well, that should be easy. Hi. Regina, right? And who are y'all? Ah, Mr. Petry. You remembered. How's everything going? Well, just peachy, Petry. Daddy came right to town to get me and everything has been well, just stupendous. Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that. Uh, I feel a little bit guilty though. I tried to catch you after you left my office, but I missed you. And then I've been up in San Francisco and, uh, my daughter lives up there. I could see her once a month. Oh, how nice. I hate it. -REGINA: You do? -Yeah. I'm gonna run away. REGINA: Oh, honey, I know exactly how you feel. You see the only difference is mine has money. Well, I guess I'd best be getting back up to the house. You know how Daddy's are,when you get out of their sight for just one little old minute. Decent Daddy's I mean honey. Glad everything's going so well. Thank you. Thank you very much. Lickidy Split, not bad. So, now can I be your partner? No you can't, Bop Diddely, remember? How can I know what it is, when you made it up? I didn't make it up. What the hell's going on? And what the hell is that? I was thirsty. You ain't wrapped up too tight,are you pal? Just keep your hands where I can see them, huh? Pow. Ah. This can't be the right car. He just shot me with his bottle. Pulling the bottle was the greatest. Just the greatest. Yeah, because if you would've pulled your real gun, he would've killed us all for sure. That's quick thinking H.P. I'm quick in a pinch. A close call. A very close call. Where's uncle Max? [BURPS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] The jobs over with. We could go in and shoot them up a little. Yeah. We could but, bullets are getting so expensive. I think we will just let Clapperand Skeeter take care of Peter. [MOUTHING] Uncle Petry? Uncle Petry I-- What do you think Bop Diddely is? Take a guess. I want to dance. Why not? Oh, you're not even supposed to be in here after they stop serving food and... [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Powder your nose. I haven't got any powder. Borrow some. What are you gonna do, Uncle Petry? Lead. DANIELLE: We really better go. I'm not even supposed to be in here after they stop serving food. You're the spitting image kid. I'm no kid. You could use a little mammory though. Stuff it. Good girl. Maybe Petry's right. Hey, listen. It was just the two of us. Just you and me. Yeah, well, now it isn't. This is real life, you got to understand. Excuse me. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Did you tell him? Why not? I can't. He's trouble, that one. Jeez, don't I know it. H.P. does not like surprises. You owe me money, babe. Why don't you hit Hugo up for a loan? Baby sit my foot. Oh, sounds like a very nice place to start. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] What do you mean I never touched a fig leaf that didn't turn into a price tag? I didn't say that. Saul Bellow did. What I said was, I never touched a fig leaf that didn't turn into an emotional price tag. Now are you gonna give me something long-winded and philosophical? I'm not in the mood. Neither am I.

Here he comes, Max. -What is it? Yeah. -What did you take? I didn't take nothing, huh. Look, I think you better tell him tonight. I can't I got other things I want to discuss. Like what? Did you know he and his brotherhaven't talked in a long time? Brother? I didn't know he had a brother until you came along. And also they're twins. -Hello. -Hello. HARRY: Hello. -Have a good time? -Have a good time? -Yeah. -Sounds like a yes to me. Sounds like he had a very good time. Uh-hmm. Ooh, gin. -You can't. -Yeah, why not? Because I took the card you would gin with. Ding-dongs anybody? -No thanks. -Later. Which card did you take? Oh, boy. -Anybody feed the sharks? -Yeah. I did. Oh, boy I'm tired. I guess I'll go home. I'll teach you how to cheat next time, kid. What do you mean next time? I kicked your butt this time. Oh, Candy's back in town. Ding dong, the witch is dead. Well, next time, I'll teach youhow to [INDISTINCT] Good night, H.P. Night, Perry Mason. Keep up the good work. DANIELLE: Are you in a good mood? Yup. DANIELLE: So, we better get a bigger place now. HARRY: I'll think about it. DANIELLE: Yeah. At least think about it. What's the taste like? Gopher piss. Listen, if you're mad about Candy-- I'm not mad about Candy. --or if you're jealous or something I'd understand that. I'm not jealous either. Well what then. You didn't tell me the truth. I don't lie. When you let her, you said that we all need three hugs a day just to survive. You don't hug Candy, you just sleep with her. You don't know what I do with Candy. And you haven't hugged me since I got here. You'd make a lousy father. I told you that from the beginning. And you also lied about puttingyourself at service to the Universe which is love. You don't do that. You're a bum and you don't know where your next hugs coming from. And you're a fat little kid with a ding dong problem. I'm not fat. You came out to LA and ding- donged yourself to death, your honor, did I supply the weapons? Yes, sir, I did. Stupid jackass I am. Listen you're on a pass,you could be gone in 10 minutes, don't press your luck with me. My father says that kind of stuff to me. That's probably because you start bossing him around. What happened between you two? Look, I just came from something nice. How come you're putting the heat on? -Somebody should. -And you're gonna do it? I just got your best interests in mind. That's what everybody sayswho wants anything from anybody. I'm not gonna be here forever, and I just don't want to see you grow old all alone. Well, I'm old now and I'm alone and that's the way I want it. If you don't like to see it, beat it. Can I give you a hug? You shouldn't have to ask. I'm sorry I made you mad. No, no, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Will you teach me how to follow? I'm tired Danny, honest. Is that okay? Oh, stand up. You know how to make a point? DANIELLE: Well, what's a point? Just put all your weight on one foot, just one foot, now watch. Watch what happens. Like that, nice, not bad, see that. Okay now the object is to let go, just let go. -Who's bigger, me or you? -You. Okay bigger one leads, boys lead. Not always. No, not always but, uh, makes it pretty tough on men and women. Boys are born to lead and protect. Women, understandably do not wish to be number two. It makes it almost impossible to have a relationship. Okay. That's right. Not bad, not bad. DANIELLE: You gonna take me dancing some time? Never. And can I get all dressed up like Candy? Maybe. And can I wear makeup? Makeup? That's a dip. You want a 20-minute lecture on women under 40 wearing makeup? -No, thank you. -Okay. one more off this. Pretty good. You're all right. You can do it. Uh-hmm. Sit down. Are you really gonna take me dancing? Yeah. Promise? -Yeah. -Good. Oh, look. If all I've said doesn't mean anything to you, then forget it. We'll make it just this. I won't because all of me wants it, regardless of consequences. Humphrey Bogart. Yeah, my favorite. Don't be too sure, I'm as crooked as I'm supposed tobe. And so the reputation might be good business, bringing high price jobs and making it easier to deal with the enemy. DANIELLE: A New York detective would've kidnapped her on the spot. HARRY: Isn't it time for... People's Court? What time is it? It's time. By the time Max got through with People's Court they'd probably take it off the air. As for kidnapping Regina, that was just asking for trouble. But if she had any sense she might listen to reason. Stealing the dirty tape would be easy. If Daddy wanted it back he'd have no choice but to pay me the five Gs. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Regina? -[GASPS] Oh, God damn not you again. Listen to me, will you? That boyfriend of yours is a no good. Are you stupid or what? My boyfriend loves me. You can't be that naive. Mr. Petry, why don't you just get the hell out of here? Regina, you know your father better than anybody. He's not gonna stand for that trashy movie. It's a disgrace to him and his Southern gentility. Why, Mr. Petry? I do believe that you have been out in the cold just a little too long. I do believe your brain has turned into frostbite. What else can I tell you? Have you ever heard a Southern virgin scream, Mr. Petry? Only once. It was her 21st birthday and that's all she wanted. What do you wantfor your 18th birthday, Regina? You son of a bitch. All right. You bothering this girl again, Petry? Yeah. This boy's a real slow learner, ain't he? -Clapper, huh? -You know guys, I can walk. -That is it, kid. -Boys. Yes, yes, yes, Your Honor. Now, my client... -Just give me one-- -Hey, that's my, Uncle Max. The good looking guy in the suit. What, uh, we have here. Woopty doo. Yeah. It's fun, huh? Oh, God. -MAX: The case of a-- -Star. STINSON: You see, Harold, we already accidently found my little girl so that means that your servicesare no longer required. HARRY: So, goodnight and goodbye. STINSON:Now, that would be very simple. Shows that you're smart and it shows that you're thinking. I like that. Guess what else? You want to tell him, hon? Well, I sure do. Daddy is gonna put up $300,000 and Peter's gonna do a moving picture show. It's gonna be a sports movie. And I'm gonna be the star. They'll be lining up clear round the palm tree for that one. WOMAN: Shit. God damn finger. It won't cut up vegetables but cut off my thumb. Look at this. That's blood, that's my blood. Hey, blondy, move over. WOMAN: You want it? You want it back? I'll sell it to you for $269.95 cents? You want it, Pluto? We seem to have [CLEARS THROAT] forgotten, um... This guy's good. -Terrific -Sharp. This guy's dynamite. [LAUGHS] He ain't got nothing to say, Judge. MAX: What, um, we have here is a, uh, clear, cut-- - Petry? You see we also got another little problem. Now, you see poor old Clapper here, he's been mad as an old razorback for almost a week now. See, his eyes are watering like crazy. And he's got his hand all hurt. Corns on his toes are popping something fierce like from walking all over this concrete that y'all got out here. Pretty soon, he's gonna be looking to hurt somebody. Of course, he's gonna just naturally gonna think of you. Listen, Stinson. I don't know anything and I don't care. Why don't you guys just drop the charges and let me go? No way. HARRY: [GRUNTS] Everyone with guns, guys it's not necessary. -Do I shoot him? -Hell no, you don't shoot him. STINSON: Don't lock up the trunkso tight boys that he can't get out clean. You hear? Clapper, you got the ax? Ax? CLAPPER: Yeah, all set, boss. -Have fun. -Guys. [IMITATES CAR ENGINE REVVING] [IMITATES TIRES SCREECHING] HARRY: Okay. Clapper. Come on. Clapper. CLAPPER: [SCREAMING] [SCREAMS AND GROANS] Go ahead, go ahead. Go get him, Clapper. He ain't gonna be long in there. [DOGS BARKING] -Whoa! -Come on guys. Let me shoot him. Me first. I'll shoot him. Come on. [DOGS BARKING] I'll shoot him. Oh! Oh, shit! SKEETER: Come on, Clapper. There he is. Go get him, Clapper. Go get him. Get him. Hurry. Hurry. Come on. Come get him, Clapper. Come on, Clapper. HARRY: Oh, no! Don't shoot. Don't-- CLAPPER: Come on. Let's go. Come on. HARRY: All right, boys. You know, I'm sure to catch -a cold like this, maybe-- -CLAPPER: Shut up. HARRY:--probably get an ear infection. CLAPPER: Shut up. HARRY: Danielle! [GRUNTING] Let me out of here. Let me out of here you bird brains. There's an ax in there twinkle toes. Cut your way out. DANIELLE: [IMITATES CAR ENGINE REVVING] [IMITATES TIRES SCREECHING] HARRY: Help! They got Uncle Petry. HARRY: Let me out of here. [CAR ENGINE TURNING OVER] Wow. [TIRES SCREECHING] DANIELLE: Whoops. [TIRES SCREECHING] Get out of the way. Coming through. Oh. Get out of the way. Pretty good. Uncle Petry. I'm coming, Uncle Petry. Damn you guys. HARRY: This isn't nice. Clapper, can you hear me? You're a pig. Oink! Oink, oink. Where are they? Where did they go? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, no you don't. [TIRES SCREECHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] All right. That's it. I'm mad now. I'm mad. You better watch it you guys. You dirty rats. HARRY: I didn't figure they wanted to kill me, just ditch me somewhere far, far, away. You morons, I left my niece back there. This is uncomfortable, you... [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HARRY: I'm gonna get you guys. Come on, Clapper. HARRY: I'm afraid of the dark. Let me out. [CAR HONKING] Come on. Let's get out of here. HARRY: Open this box. [CAR HONKING] CLAPPER: Jeez, they'll bring the cops. They must be drunk. HARRY: Hey! [GRUNTS] DANIELLE: I'll save you. I'm coming. Hold on, Uncle Petry. I'm coming. Please don't die, Uncle Petry. Here I am. Don't die. [COUGHS] Here I come, Uncle Petry. No! Oh my God, Uncle Petry. [GASPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] I thought you were dead. Hang on. Okay. We're almost there. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] What took you so long? Stopped for an Orange Julius. Relax, Danny. You can't kill the dead. That's not funny. He can hardly talk. [SIGHS] Sounds like a blessing. Let's see what's happening here. Oh my God. Really? I hate to be the one to have to tell you this but unfortunately, he's gonna live. Where does it hurt? Between my back and my legs. Huh! Sounds like brain damage to me. Well, since you're taking this vacation, what do you suggest we do? Um, the old lady's willingto pay two Gs for the Mercedes. Why don't you grab it? -That it? -Hmm... I think the Yankee butter trickwould be very nice. Sounds like sticky business to me H.P. -And, Max. -What? Would you teach her how to do Bop Diddely? -Check. -Oh, good. Okay. Get some rest. Let's go, Danny. Can you get it? Like I can get ugly girls. Don't talk like that, Max. Why not? I like ugly girls. They try harder. Oh, Max. Got the gooey stuff? [DOORBELL RINGING] SKEETER: What is it? DANIELLE: Hi. Who are you? DANIELLE: I'm Danielle. My uncle said you guys are a bunch of phonies. And he said thanks for the really nice car. And... that's Bop Diddely sat here. CLAPPER: Hey, you what's going on here? -[GRUNTS] -DANIELLE: You rat. So long suckers. SKEETER: She's stealing Peter's car. -Well, let's go after her. -She's stealing Peter's car. We'll, come on get it. Come on boys DANIELLE: Come on guys. STINSON: Hey, come on, stop her! Get her! Come on, come on! We'll be waiting at the corner. Yahoo! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] What the hell? ALL: [GROANING] -Ow! -[SIGHS] Ain't this the shits. Nope, its honey. Oh, you God damn fool. [LAUGHING] I was right there. I got a great idea. Yes. -[INDISTINCT] -Nope. No, you're not. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Hey Max, what are you doing? [BEEPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Now, you need a nice dress what about this place? No? Come on. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Petry and Petry detective services. How may we-- hello? This is Henrietta Cable. Who am I speaking with please? Is this Mr. Harold Petry? Yes, it is. New York. What school? Yes, she's here. Yes, I can understand how upset you must be. I know exactly how she is. Yes, I do. Her parents are where? Well, they're in Europe. I thought they were dead. How Hollywood and not a very funny joke, Mr. Petry. You're right not very funny at all. Danielle must be returned to the custody of the school immediately, Mr. Petry. Otherwise, we will have to take whatever legal means are necessary in order to protect ourselves. -Come on. -Oh, okay. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] I want her on that flight and I'll meet the plane, do you understand me, Mr. Petry? HARRY: Understood. -Are we clear?-I said I understood, didn't I? [LAUGHTER] No wonder she ran away from school. Yes, thank you very much. Bitch. Will you marry me? -Uncle Max. -I'm serious. I have a thing for pretty young girls. I thought you said you liked ugly girls. Well, you're so beautiful that I changed my mind. How old are you? Fifteen? Sorry too old. [LAUGHS] So what am I feeling bad about? They are right there in Europe. MISS CABLE: After all, this could be considered a kidnapping. She is a minor and a runaway. Hey, guess what I found? Uh-oh. Uncle Petry. You're booked on Pan Am 181 6:00. Miss Cable will be there in New York when you get in. No, Uncle Petry, please. You'd better hurry or you'll miss your flight. What's going on here, H.P.? Please, Uncle Petry. Your parents are fine. They're in Europe some place. But you promised. Promised what? To take me dancing. You called me a liar. I didn't lie. I just said they were gone. They're always gone. Well, the promise is off. You're going back tonight. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] I hope you're happy. Don't you know how much that little girl likes you? HARRY: It's about time I got back to my own life. Get her to the airport, Max. Tickets at the desk. -Uncle Petry. -Goodbye kid. Sorry all this had to happen on your birthday. How'd you know it was my birthday? I didn't even tell, Max. Miss Cable mentioned it. Take the hat if you like. Oh. We women don't really care about birthdays too much. Yeah, you're getting up there pretty soon, you're going to have to stop counting. Give me a call in a week or two. Maybe we'll have you out atChristmas for a couple of days. -You mean it? -Sure. I'll steal a tree or something. Do I really have to go now? Yeah, I promised Miss Cable. MAX: Harry? Max, it's out of my hands. Would you please take her? It's her birthday dammit. All right come on, kid. Let's go. And it's better to leave the place than stay when you're not wanted, don't you think? Let's go let's go. Please Uncle Petry. Remember your Bop Diddely. Thanks for everything. I'm sorry I lied. It's all right. There's nothingto be sorry about. I understand everything. Uncle Petry stop drinking, please-- Come on kid. Let's go, waste no time. I'll marry you Uncle Max, honest I will. All right, all right, let's go. I gotta stay. I got to. I love you Uncle Petry, -MAX: Let's go kid. -DANIELLE: I love you. Now, what are you going to do for Christmas? Beat up Santa Claus? The girldove into water she can't swim. Would you please get out of here Max? You got it, champ. I love you Uncle Petry. I love you. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CAR ENGINE TURNING OVER] [TIRES SCREECHING] HARRY: Nice going, speed. You didn't give her a hug, didn't let her know you cared. Nice! I'm a lot taller than Humphrey Bogart. Don't tell me how I feel about Candy. I'm putting myself at service to the universe which is love. I probably deserve that one. I told her about the butterflies, didn't I? What do you think, ether was forever? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HARRY: No wonder I only charge five bucks. And should been give a change. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Just like always, you stand up and keep on going. That's it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Candy, I'm getting real tired of talking to this machine but, if you get this message and you're in the mood, I'm going down to the joint and I sort a feel like, uh... dance a little. Where is everybody? You're real early. PAUL: Petry, all dressed up. Special night? Can I play something special for you? Pick it, Paul. PAUL: Leave it to me [PIANO PLAYING] BARTENDER: J.D. rocks. No, ginger ale and rocks. BARTENDER: I don't believe it. Neither do I. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] We've got a birthday request and here it comes. Whose birthday is it? BARTENDER: [INDISTINCT] Well, send him a drink anyway. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right, it says here, you're kidding, another birthday. And a very unusual request comes with it. The young lady is [CLEARS THROAT] years old today. And now listen to this, she challenges her uncle to dance with her. Wow. I like that. Let's see what happens here. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, what if he refuses me? I'll buy you 16 gorillas. That's pretty dumb, Max. Go on. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You drinking? None of your business. You leaving?
