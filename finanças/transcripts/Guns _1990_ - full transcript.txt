Look, this is our shot at the big time. Sure, I've earned it, cubby. That's right, Tito. Just be cool, man. Keep it cool, kid. Here he comes. My associates in Detroit have recommended you highly. Well we did the job, Mr. degas. That's degas. The s is silent. Yes, sir. Mr. degas, we're experts in our field. The bigger the challenge, the more we enjoy it. This is a simple assassination. I want it clean I'm with you, sir. I happen to be one of the pioneers in high-tech equipment. You must know about our recent work in New York City. Picture this. Park Avenue penthouse. A man and a woman return home we're stationed a quarter of a mile away. The man is getting ready to park this chick, right. Yeah, every time she turns away he's looking in the mirror checking for nose hairs. Actually he mixes himself a Martini, right Tito? Yeah, right. Anyway, here's the beautiful part. She takes a lemon peel. He takes an olive. The transistor is in the olive he blows boom! She is maybe, what? Soiled. Yeah, soiled. Soiled. That's clean, sir. That's your bet. My bet is a Smith and Wesson beats four aces When we land in Honolulu, tong and I will take a commuter plane to Molokai. You two will get there by helicopter. On Molokai I will identify the target. We will not see or talk to each other until we meet again in Las Vegas. Morning, ladies. Hi Terry. Hi Joan. Hey guys, how you doing? - Good. - Hi hey, have I got a dress for you. It could be a one of a kind. Just came in and I've had my eye on it so it wouldn't get sold. What do you think? God, it's perfect for tonight! We're flying some cargo over to Honolulu and I'm meeting Bruce there for dinner. God, I haven't seen him in three weeks. Why don't you try it on? Yeah, yeah yeah, put it on. Here you go. Could be better, Donna. That tour I had coming in from Maui. Yeah? Had some sort of mechanical problem. So now I've got 43 for lunch that just canceled. So anybody in here care for rocky's special tropical fruit plate? Got your hands full. Restaurant owner by day, undercover federal agent by night. Yeah, that's me, I do it all, everything from busting heads to baking bread. And this is to guarantee romance. After three weeks, isn't that overkill? Donna. She's in the dress shop now. Brunette, green dress, yellow lel. This is for you to leave upon the remains. Mr. degas, I have a flair for this kind of work. I like to express my imagination. Transistor explosives are our specialty. You'll have a very unique result. It can serve as an alert, as well as accomplish your goal. Gentlemen, enough. Just use the cerebral approach. How's that? Shoot her in the head. One of a kind, Joan? Well I only said it could be one of a kind. I hope you don't plan on wearing that in Honolulu tonight. Oh no, just to the restaurant. It's my honeymoon. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Champagne is on the house for all honeymooners. Thank you. I've gotta get going, so I'll see you guys later. - Okay. - Bye rocky. - Bye. - Congratulations. Now please, stay away from Honolulu tonight. I will. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Congratulations. - Thanks. I don't get it. You spend years cultivating a reputation, then you still get hired as a ordinary, run-of-the-mill trigger man. Yeah, tell me about it. You know I was the first man ever to use walkie talkies on a hit we set a good look in this business, you know. We run a training camp, for Christ's sake! Your years in Switzerland have been good to you, my friend. It's wonderful to see you back in circulation. You look good, sifu, as always. You are ageless! Just like the old days. To meet like this. Yes, but in the old days we never took the time to enjoy the pleasantries. We were always too busy running for our lives! Touche. I've heard that the government forces in south America has become a problem for you. If not because of your personal involvement, I would have left this transaction to others. This is an opportunity for me to take care of unfinished business. And I miss the excitement. The latest in Chinese technology. This is an instrument of beauty. It is an instrument of death. I don't know why the man would pay for caviar when all he really wants is tuna salad. Instant results, man. Nobody cares about workmanship anymore. Fortunately, the war I'm waging is not governed by the Geneva convention. Five guns are already on their way to your country via Mexico. We were able to refuel on Kauai. We avoided customs by declaring diplomatic immunity. But it was a very risky gamble. This is an ideal location to refuel your plane. I have seen to it that in one hour, there will not be a federal agent within a thousand miles of Molokai. Four days from now, the plane carrying your shipment will land here for refueling. Good. I will have the final payment when I meet the plane in Mexico. The first one is free. And the next 50 will cost you dearly. Old habits never change. Take care. You too. Rocky! Why! Oh no! We were just sitting there and then all of a sudden... How could this happen? How could it be? Oh god, I saw it! Why would anybody do this? I saw it! Oh god! I can't believe it! She's dead. Two women just walked in here and shot them! Did you see two women come through here? Just a couple guys a few minutes ago. Come on Donna, let's go. Nicole, what is it? Those two men came out of the women's room! Heads up! The men dropped the car off at the airport. They just took off in a small helicopter. We missed them! Clear! Honolulu tower, this is November niner niner 786. Do you have a reading on a two-place Robinson copter? What's its heading? It's heading over cocoa head towards the north shore, flying fast and low. Contact Shane Abilene at dillingham. See if he has them in sight. No Nicole, no copter. Radar's clean too. How about the old airstrip at turtle bay? It's remote, but worth a shot. What's going on? Shane, rocky's dead. Murdered by two men dressed up as women. They left a calling card. We're up to our butts in this thing and we don't even know what it's about! Get a hold of Bruce and bring him up to date. We'll check out turtle bay and we'll keep you posted. Look, they've landed! They're on the ground! Hurry, get in here! Dammit, they're headed for the tunnel! We're low on fuel there's a million of those rental cars on this island. We'll never find it in this traffic! Donna, let's put down at Shane's. Okay, here we go. Hey Donna, there's Bruce now. What the hell happened? This was found on the dead body. It's from a Vegas casino. Looks like someone's trying to get your attention. But why did they have to kill that poor girl? It was a professional hit. They killed her with a 22 caliber gun, silencer attach that was no random shooting, but they shot the wrong person. 5'7", brunette, that green dress. They thought they killed you, Nicole. And rocky? In the line of duty. What's our next play? I think we should go to Las Vegas. No no, that's crazy. It's a setup. Well it won't be the first time, and I think we're in too deep to back off now. The agency plane is gassed and ready. We can be in the air in five minutes. The agency's given us a green light to continue the mission as we see fit have you contacted Lucas? Yes. Is he with the Las Vegas bureau? Intelligence. He runs a hotel on a strip as his cover. He could round up a team for us. Yeah, he's already on it. Good. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Let's go. ♪ No ♪ ♪ Don't play with guns ♪ ♪ They ain't that fun ♪ ♪ Then let me tell you I'm the one ♪ I'm the one ♪ Edy stark, ladies and gentlemen! And now, the Copacabana lounge is proud to present unique magical talents of the amazing Abe and Ace. You know, it's really wonderful to see you, darling. I just heard from the agency. That mic was too hot there's something up. You know, I think they're running FFX. The Hawaii division needs us you know me, I need all the gravy I can get. Are you listening to me? They're on their way in now. You know, I think this blue looks much better than the pink. Don't you agree? No? We're meeting at 9:00 A.M. for a full update. Edy, did you hear me? Although, you know, I don't really think the guys on the front row noticed. Somebody should've gotten them some hand lotion. You're not listening to me. I'm all ears. You're pinned! Cheat! Bitch! My boyfriend doesn't want me to oil-wrestle anymore. Why is that, hugs? He doesn't think it's dignified. Neither is a blow job. Does he complain about that? You should clean your ears before you clean your fingerprints. When you shot that brunette, you shot the wrong woman! Your assignment is far from over. Yes, sir. Let me fill you in on some background. So you get a better perspective on exactly what it is you have done. Donna Hamilton is an undercover federal agent who runs an inter-island cargo service with her partner, Nicole Justin Nicole Justin is the one you were supposed to kill, but Hamilton, she's dedicated and dangerous. Now she's responsible for some very serious interruptions in the machinery of my international network. Why did you just want one of them killed? Hamilton's caused more trouble so what, we'll kill them both. Yeah, two-for-one special. I want Donna Hamilton killed, but I wanna do it myself. - Okay. - Hey, you're the boss. Now did you leave the card at the scene? I did good. No doubt both women are on the way to Las Vegas. Yeah, we were chased clear across the island by plane. Good. Have the airport watched, and all surrounding airstrips. And use that new weapon we received. I'm interested in performance report on the battle condition. Done. I wanted to be free of distractions when Ms. Hamilton showed up, but it looks like my focus will be clouded, and I hate when that happens. You two lay low, but stay close. - Yes, sir. - Come on, out. I would not have made such a sloppy mistake. Your assets are quite apparent to me, my love. Then let me kill for you. In time, my sweet. In time We're gonna set down outside of Vegas. The agency has a small strip there. Roger that. We'll head for havisu right away. Degas. We're on track The bikers, get it right. Nicole, hang on! Bruce, he's coming back! Look Shane, they're in trouble! Get down, look out! This bike's history. Come on, let's go! Don't just do something! Stand there! Check this out. It's Chinese. The latest in assault weapon technology. This model has limited allocation to the elite Chinese defense unit this is getting uglier by the minute. You're telling me. This Van's shot and I gotta get a new bike. Do your thing, Nicole. - All right! - Go get them! Yeah! Go get them, Nicole! Yes baby, show him what you got. Hello there I'm the California kid. You look like a woman in distress I could take you away from all this. We could be married in an hour well how about a lift to the town? She didn't say no. Come on in. - All right! - Yeah, we're outta here! - Let's go! - All right! - We're outta here! - Good work! We made it! All right! Thank you, babe. It was nice, darling. Nice meeting you. Thank you, sweetheart. Be careful with this little puppy. Thanks. - See ya later. - See ya. I think it's significant that we've gathered for a meeting here, next to the London bridge. For more than 2,000 years there has been a bridge across the Thames river in London in 1962 this very bridge was actually falling down. Sinking due to heavy traffic and erosion. But before it could be destroyed, the industrious people of lake havisu city, Arizona purchased the bridge from England and meticulously reconstructed it, piece by piece here on this very site. Teamwork, that's how this bridge was transposed to here. And that's what we need to accomplish our goal, teamwork. No individual efforts or personal vendettas. As a team we can be as formidable as the London bridge itself. This card is the Mark of Joaquin de diamondes. Jack of diamonds. South American born, Oxford educated, international domain he was a rough character. He fled south America shortly after my father was killed there. De diamondes was blown to bits on a yacht in merse harbor. That was nearly 10 years ago. But why would they want me killed, and you in Vegas when I'm the one who testified there? And how the hell did they get a hold of this kind of artillery? And who are they? That's what we're here to find out. We get a lot of international high rollers at the club. I can scope out the new faces and the ones who are connected I'll check the computer date filed reports to see what I come up with. Those shemales, the crossdressers, think they're from around here? Snake tattoo, right hand? Correct. I'll rouse the drag bars. If they're around, someone will get wind of it. You know, they picked up a couple of guys in Carson city yesterday, known gunrunners. Yeah, I pulled a couple of strings and I borrowed them from the... Attorney General's people. I think I'm gonna pay them a visit later on today. Need a hand? No thanks. We're just gonna do a little reminiscing first and then I'll ask them for help. Donna, I've had a request for you to meet with the attorney general in Carson city. That is the sexiest damn lady I've ever met. Oh really? Well present company excluded, girls. I don't believe this will be a social call. Donna Hamilton to see the Attorney General. Miss Hamilton, will you come in? This is Shane Abilene. The meeting between us is private. You're welcome to wait over there What do you hope to accomplish by being here? Someone used my father's death to lure me here. That doesn't answer my question. It's been 10 years since my father was killed trying to stop drug smugglers in south America. I know that well in case you missed it, there's a war on drugs going on in this country. Murder by federal agent is still murder. If we lose this war, we can't just pack our bags and move on. I don't want you interfering with due process under any circumstances! And I certainly don't want it happening under my nose. Unfortunately, the forces we're up against are not tied to legal obstacles such as the United States constitution. Send in Mr. Abilene, please. Why don't you settle down, get married, have babies? Some of us just aren't cut out for that line of work. Tell me about it One of your people, Mr. Abe summerfield, borrowed two of my prisoners today. We are this close to indictment and I don't want anything to happen to them. Abe's a pussycat. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Well you're not me, and your ass is gonna be in a sling if my orders are disobeyed. You got that, cowboy? Yes, ma'am. Good, get out. Meeting's over. That mother is some bitch. That bitch is my mother. Boys. Okay! Showtime! Look at this now you see it. Now you don't. That's a clear sign of poor social intercourse. All right, now, do we know how to play 20 questions? I ask 20 questions. You give me 20 answers. All right, question number one. Did you hear about that messy hit in Hawaii yesterday? Eat a sack of shit, fat man. Now are you ready for question number two? Do you know anything about that neato little plane in the desert, with the big nasty gun? Nothing I'm gonna tell you about. Wrong answer. We don't know nothing, man. You have to know something, or else you're gonna lose the game. Who the hell is this guy? He's not a cop. There you go again! Now you're not playing the game right, fella! I'm the guy who asks the question, you answer, all right? Now, here's question number three. Do you know who I am? All right, picture this. It's a lonely desert road outside of Las Vegas. Two federal agents are driving back to Carson city. - Geez, what the hell's that? - What? Damn, that chopper's got a bazooka! What? Well got off the road or something! I see him! He's gonna hit us! - All right, all right! - Where's my gun? Shit! Pull over! Son of a bitch was gonna shoot us! Oh jeez! The ones of the flower have been scattered this hour. Let's go! You were the man that made that hit now do you know who I am? Yeah, queen Elizabeth. I'm the brother of one of those agents who died in that car now, who ordered the hit in Hawaii? Why don't you go fuck yourself? Hokey smokes! This isn't going well at all. Hey, here's the big question. What's the difference between a terrorist and a magician? You can negotiate with a terrorist. What the hell happened here? You should've searched those suspects before you let me in to talk to them. Hey, I'm a federal agent, not a street cop. I'm lucky to be alive. I personally checked the entire plane wreckage. The gun is gone. That makes me unhappy, tong. But there are now, how do you say, plenty more where that came from. Yo, we also received word that, two of our people were taken out by some fat guy with magic tricks. Well as long as our friends stay busy here on the mainland, our plan is intact. Have the villa in Acapulco prepared, will you tong? Sure. How serious were your problems in Vegas? Damn serious. I was a 17-year-old orphan when I met a guy who wanted to take care of me. He worked directly for a mob leader, and when he began to question his boss's tactics, I found him in the trunk of his car with his eyes shot out. I had nothing to lose, so I went to the DA's office to testify. Donna's mother handled the case Kathryn and I became pretty close. And then when it was all over, it was her idea to team me up with Donna. Fate put that brunette in that same green dress. Nicole, there's a reason why your life was spared. Yeah guess I better watch my ass? I can help with that. Hey girl. I'm large Marge, and I believe you know my friend. Yeah, I recognize her aroma. Can we buy you a drink? No, I'm waiting for someone. We are someone I don't think so, babe. You smart-mouthed little bitch! You're under arrest! Let's get outta here, cubby! Move it! Stop those guys! Stop them! Damn! Nice try guys. We almost had them talk to head office for me. I gotta get a day job.

Coming up next, the magic magnificence of Abe and Ace summerfield! Ladies and gentlemen. Nothing up here. And nothing up here. My darling, would you please assist me by picking out a card? Show it to your friends. All right. You got it? You know it? We won't need these now will you take that lid, please? That your card? Ladies and gentlemen, the size of my dressing room. You remember Abraham Lincoln's hat? Edy. You're improving. Well thank you. I do what I can and you smell just as good as ever. You seem to be improving as well. And I do what I can this is Juan degas. You're a most beautiful songstress. Thank you. I was kind of sorry to hear you'd given up dancing. I've developed another interest. It's just as well I guess. It must be awfully hard dancing with your legs straight up in the air. Enjoy the rest of the show. Who's the player with the sexy brunette? He's new in town, a European. His name is degas. He's checked into one of the most elegant suites here at the hotel and that's not a sexy brunette. It's a girl I used to dance with. You know the type, loose hips, wet lips, real desperate for attention, and she always wears entirely too much perfume. My kinda gal. Not very funny. What about the rest of the group? I've got a nice yearbook photo of each of them. I'll have a stack of 8x10s for you tomorrow. The wannabe Fu Manchu guy's a local. He's known as tong. He shows up everywhere with degas. He's been living here at the hotel in degas's suite. Moving up in the world. The two guys Abe tanked today worked for tong. That could backfire. Well if you'll excuse me, it's time for my second set. I'd stick around if I were you. I've got a big surprise for you. Tong. Is that the magic man who eliminated our two men earlier today? That's him. My love, do you still wish to kill for me? I want to feel the power of controlling life and death right this way. I bet you wish you could do to your wife what I'm about to do to mine A big thank you to the amazing Abe and Ace. Coming up next, edy stark! I gotta run, I gotta work out with Donna. In my gym? Yeah brown, why don't you tag along, just in case? Tong, have Lou and Chen see what they're up to. Let's go. Keep it closer to the neck. Arch your back, get the back arched. Elbows straight down. Straight down in the elbows. All right, that was good. That's it for me. I'm hitting the shower. Ready for a game of drop the soap? Drop this. Hey, give me another set of 20. I'm gonna get some fresh towels. I'll be right back. Let me outta here! What's going on! Shane! Shane! Hiyah! Hiyah my ass. Nice outfit. Tong, you are making me look bad. Bitch is uncanny. We didn't even know she was there. All right. Tomorrow, we raise the stakes. - Let me go! - Hey, hey! Hold it right there! Let me go! Let me go! Stay quiet or I'll kill you! Let's go, cubby! Gotta leave the card, man. We're going into town for some chow. Okay, I'll see you guys later. See you in a while. Okay. Hey Ace! Come on out! The fishing's great! I got some work to do! I'll join you later! Hey Ace, send down another beer! We're gonna have a fish Friday night, baby! Baby, this one's for you. Right. Yeah, they sent a cleanup squad over, but I doubt they'll find any prints on the boat. Abe was blown to bits about 100 yards down shore from here. I understand I'm gathering my crew now. I'll have someone wait here for an update. We won't find our answers here. All right. Now that we're all here, let's go inside, see what we can find out. What the hell is behind all of this? The guns used in south America yesterday are the same as the one used against us in the desert. And where did those guns come from? People's Republic of China. And how did they get to south America? Small aircraft. But you can't fly a small aircraft from China to south America without stopping to refuel. Now it's not that we're here on the mainland. It's that we're not there they got us out of Hawaii so they could run guns right through our front yard. Guns, south America. - Yeah? - It's adding up to a case against tong. What? Okay, I'll pass that on. Kathryn Hamilton was kidnapped this morning, and they left their calling card. Cash. You have performed to perfection. You do have style. You finally noticed. I will reward you when I return. And I will reward you when you return. Bye. What a pleasant surprise. Thank you, boys. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Joaquin de diamondes. You might know me as the Jack of diamonds. You son of a bitch, you can't be. Nice to meet you too. De diamondes's body was in pieces 10 years ago when it was identified. Money talks, Jack walks. How did you get here? No no no no. This isn't exactly the right setting for a seminar on trade secrets. I'm gonna get outta here and I'm gonna kill you! Your husband was a formidable adversary, as is your daughter, so I have no doubt about your ability, but unfortunately, you're at a grave disadvantage. Grave disadvantage. What an interesting choice of words! You slime! Oh god! Oh no! No, god! That Jack of diamonds is a shrewd son of a bitch. Just when we figured out that he has us where he wants us, we can't leave. He's kidnapped Kathryn! No Nicole, you must leave. I want you and Bruce back on Molokai today. We can't let them get away with smuggling those guns. Donna, I am not leaving you here alone. I'm in charge here. You'll do as I say. I won't be alone. Shane will be with me. Please don't fight me on this one. Okay folks, line up for government cheese. Bruce, this baby's for you. Kym, I have a p7 here with a silencer. - Go to town. - All right. Nicole, this little sweet thing's for you. Special Teflon bullets, penetrate anything. This is the rocket gun. I don't think we'll be needing this today. And Donna, you've seen this before. A few times. Lucas, can I get you anything? Okay. Then there's old faithful I'll be handling this. Per request by Lucas, we'll be in radio contact. Now we will maintain radio contact at all times, got it? Now where's edy? She split a few minutes ago. I thought you knew. No, I didn't know. Looking for this? I picked up on your scent at the magician's houseboat. You always did have a tendency to overdo. That gun is a 25 millimeter Beretta model 950 you've had your eight, bitch. Bruce and I'll wait for the lab reports. Then we're on our way back to Molokai. Nicole and I will check out the airport, the local landing strips, harbor mouth, everything. Our best bet is to stake out the hotel Shane and I will drive to the hotel and cover the front entrance. I'll cover the back entrance based on the information that we now have and what we're waiting for from the lab, I've got some homework to do. Now it is absolutely essential that we all maintain radio contact at all times. Now this is what's known as a plan. I don't want you doing anything unauthorized. We'll find Kathryn. I understand Let's hit it Have cubby and Tito find Nicole Justin, kill her. That should make Donna Hamilton lose her cool. And tong, bring the mother to me. Team one in position. Team two in position. I'm gonna stop and get sandwiches for the flight back to Molokai. I'll meet you in the coffee shop. Edy. Where have you been? Cash killed Abe and Ace, and I killed cash. Where? In degas's hotel suite. You've just changed this game from slow burn to boil. Doesn't anybody follow orders anymore? All right, listen up. Degas's woman has just been terminated. He might go over the edge when he finds out, so stay alert and stay in contact. Nobody acts on their own. You check in here first. So this is what goes on in the ladies room. Yeah, sometimes. That's the Washington line. I'll get it. Hello? Yeas I see right. Lucas, they're going to fax the last known photo of Joaquin de diamondes. Speak, you die. Let's go. Team two reports bodyguard has just brought mama bear to rear entrance. This file photo is 10 years old. Son of a bitch. It's degas. We won't be needing that. You won't, I will. Donna, don't do this. The orders are to stay put. You do that. Attention, everyone. Edy and I are on our way. We're going in and we're going in together. I'll go upstairs. The most popular hotel in Las Vegas is proud to present in our main room, straight from Carson city, Nevada, Attorney General Kathryn Hamilton! Donna, get out, it's a trap! Donna Hamilton, come on down! I'm on my way, you son of a bitch. I've called for additional units. I wanna seal off this whole area. We've got some new developments. Where are Donna and Shane? We've got some new developments too. Let's go! Backstage. Damn! We haven't been formally introduced, but you might say I'm an old family acquaintance. Donna, this is Joaquin de diamondes. You killed my father. It was business, nothing personal. Unfortunately, I take business quite personally. That's why you wanted me here while you ran guns through Molokai. Bingo. You surprised I'm not just another pretty face? You won't be for long. My father taught me well. Not well enough to get you out of this, my lovely. You see, what I love about the scenario is that I get to see you two die. My guns get through Molokai, and I'm on the beach in Acapulco in four hours. I've got your four, asshole.
