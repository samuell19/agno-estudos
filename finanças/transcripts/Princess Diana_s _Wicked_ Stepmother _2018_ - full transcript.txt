In 1981, a young Princess Diana burst onto the world stage. Here is the stuff of which fairy tales are made. But just five years earlier, Diana's private life had been turned upside-down with the arrival of her new stepmother, Raine. Famous socialite, feisty politician... Please let me finish. And all-round force of nature. Anybody who was fooled by the bouffant hair and the girly clothes was making a huge mistake. She was called sometimes a barbed-wire powder puff. She was purposeful, laser sharp in getting to where she wanted to be. Nobody is a countess three times by accident. Raine would become the most hated person in Diana's life. She became the one thing that Diana could vent all her hatred on. In Diana's eyes, Raine was the wicked stepmother who stole the affections of her father and brought chaos to the ancestral family home. She's done this, she's done that. What's she doing? She's ruining the house. Until finally, Diana could take no more. And she pushed her, and Raine fell down the stairs. But when Diana's marriage went into freefall, it was her stepmother she would turn to, and Raine would be transformed from sworn enemy into Diana's closest confidant. So if you really want to know Diana, you need to know the story of her formidable, fabulous stepmother, Raine, countess Spencer. In the late 1940s, Raine McCorquodale was launched into London's high society. It was the time of debutantes, when the finest young ladies were showcased in front of the country's most eligible bachelors. Raine was a teenager in an era when girls came out. Debutantes' balls were at their height. And she loved that. She was social, she was vivacious, she was sparkling, and she was ambitious. You couldn't miss her. If you were in a room, she shone. In 1947, Raine was voted debutante of the year... Good going for a girl who wasn'tborn into aristocracy. Raine came from a decidedly middle-class family. Her mother was the prolific romantic novelist Barbara Cartland. Raine was, in many ways, a product of her mother's imagination, and Barbara Cartland... To have her very pretty daughteras a debutante was a fulfilment of her dream. She and her mother were kind of inventing themselves as they went along. Before the year was out, Raine had bagged herself a husband, Gerald Legge, the future Earl of Dartmouth. Aged just 18, she had taken a big step up the society ladder. Big wedding, gorgeous flowing white dress, a bit of showbiz, bit of society, all fizzing like a cocktail. Raine appeared to have everything she and her mother had dreamt of... A beautiful townhouse in belgravia, a young family of her own, and a future title, countess of Dartmouth. But she wasn't entirely satisfied. I think when Raine married she had two feelings. One is that Gerald, her husband, was really very boring. And the joke was that she married a Legge, but she wore the trousers. So she got incredibly bored and thought she would do what a lot of upper-crust women did, a bit of charity work. Raine began by volunteering to help London's disadvantaged children and launched herself as a self-styled champion of the new teen generation. Lady lewisham, what do you think about our teenagers? I think they're splendid, and I'm delighted you've asked me that question. I sometimes think they get rather a raw deal. I think Raine appreciatedthat having something to say would put her name in the papers so everyone would know her and she would carry on climbing the social ladder. Well, I'm all for new ideas in everything, and I think that drab clothes mean a drab outlook, and that's part of the trouble in the world today. We're lacking leadership, lacking imagination, um, lacking inventiveness. In 1953, aged 23, Raine began a long career in local politics when she was elected as the youngest ever member of westminster city council. She later made a name for herself saving many of London's historic buildings from demolition and redevelopment, including covent garden. She did as much as anybody in the 20th century to preserve London as it looks today. You know, anybody who was fooled by the bouffant hair and the girly clothes was making a huge mistake. She was a very, very tough cookie, and she'd been described as sort of an iron fist in a velvet glove. People matter first of all. This is what I've always said, and I've been 15 years in local government. People are what matter. Raine had ambition. She wanted to get on. She used a lot of charm, she used a lot of persuasion, and she used a lot of determination. And if she thought she was right, she got her own way. But Raine's married life was less successful, and she was seldom seen in public with her husband, Gerald. Then, at an exclusive cocktail party in 1973, her eyes fell upon the divorced aristocrat Johnnie Spencer. She'd spotted Johnnie at various parties, looking incredibly miserable because his wife had left him and he was on his own. And he was reckoned to be the gloomiest man in London. And she then would invite him to dinner at her home in belgravia when Gerald wasn't there. Um, what they got up to... Who knows? Johnnie was the future 8th Earl Spencer. The Spencer family are a very important member of the British aristocracy, and I think there's more blue blood coursing through their veins than that of the royal family. Um, they have the most magnificent house, Althorp, in northamptonshire, set in, you know, hundreds of acres of parkland and filled with treasures. Johnnie's wife, Frances, had walked out on their marriage, leaving him with custody of their four children. Among them was Diana, the future Princess of Wales. Diana was extremely distraught about her mother leaving. She was six at the time, and she always says she remembers the sound of the wheels of her mother's car on the gravel drive. All she knew was that her mother had not loved her enough and not wanted her. And certainly, Diana's whole life, I would say, was colored by that abandonment and those feelings of, of not being loved. After 15 years of marriage, Johnnie was also a lost soul. But Raine was about to change all that. I think there really was a spark between Raine and Johnnie, and I think they actually fell very much in love. She certainly reignited the life of lord Spencer. She very much believed in the importance of the physical side of love. She liked sex, she liked men, and they enjoyed her. Raine and Johnnie soon became inseparable. Then, as Raine became a regular visitor to Althorp, Johnnie felt it was time to introduce her to Diana and her siblings. I think the arrival of Raine in Johnnie's life really upset all of his children. Their noses were very badly put out of joint. I think they all hated her, absolutely hated her. I mean, all the Spencer children behaved very badly to Raine. It wasn't just Diana. They would purposely gang up on her. That's why they used to sing, "rain, rain, go away," but they didn't say, "come again another day." And I'm not sure that Raine handled it terribly well. I think she decided that these children needed a mother, and she would be that mother, which was, you know, disastrous, really. When Diana was 15 years old, Althorp, her family home, was about to be invaded. Raine had divorced Gerald Legge and married Diana's father, Johnnie Spencer. It was a low-key affair at westminster's caxton hall, and not even Diana and her siblings had been informed. In retrospect, the relatively secret marriage of Raine and Johnnie was an appalling idea, and I think the children felt completely let down. How could their father not tell them? It was a great, great mistake, and that's really when the big trouble started. Suddenly Raine was an absolute fait accompli. She was in their lives, whether they liked it or not. The Spencer children soon made their feelings clear. At her first family Christmas, under the tree was a carefully wrapped book for Raine. It was the story of Marie Antoinette, the French queen who was swiftly beheaded, signed and dated in Raine's honor. They did everything they could to make her life miserable because they felt that she had made their life miserable. Well, the role of stepmother, you know, which is of course enshrined in our fairy tales as the wicked stepmother... You never have the nice stepmother. It's a very difficult job to get right, because I think, as far as she was concerned, any territory she was on was her territory. She wouldn't have been tactful, you see. She would've just thought, "oh, no! This would be far better if we do this." As Raine settled in, she set about making the 16th-century Spencer home more to her liking. The house did need desperately restoring because there was lots of damp, you know, wear and tear, basically. And she wanted to turn it from being a museum into a home. Althorp was considered one of the country's finest country houses. It had been in the Spencer family for almost 500 years. It certainly is an English gem. There was wonderful mirrors, there was very good French furniture, there was very good English furniture, they had wonderful clocks, they had wonderful paintings. It was a complete house of wonderful treasures. But she decided that it looked too dreary, so she wanted to refurbish everything. She put in double glazing. She'd go into the library, and it would've been decorated for a visit of Marie Antoinette in 1772, and she would think, no, I'm better in pink, and the whole room would be painted pink. She put carpet down, covering beautiful floors, she got rid of all the curtains, and you couldn't stop her. It became a sort of compulsion. There would be an incredibly well thought out display of portraiture in the great hall, describing a particular generation of the Spencer families or whatever, and she would have no hesitation in placing an enormous picture of herself in the middle of it, you know. She was a now person. It was all about now. But Raine didn't stop at a bit of painting and decorating; she wanted to make Althorp sparkle. Raine loved glitter and glitz, and she loved, most of all, gilding, which is making things gold, and very, very bright gold. There were hundreds of picture frames, mirrors, and clocks to re-gild, and also a priceless suite of 18th-century English furniture, so she brought in the experts. The controversy really centered upon a suite of furniture that consisted of 52 armchairs and 16 side chairs, and the decision had to be made as to how much to tone down the gilding. But many critics were horrified. Leading art experts were absolutely coruscating about what happened. One said it was absolutely totally vulgar and a disgrace. I mean, it cheapened them beyond measure, but she loved that type of thing. Word of Raine's sweeping changes to Althorp soon got back to Diana and her siblings. In protest, Diana cut down her visits home from boarding school. I think when the children found out what Raine was doing at Althorp, they loathed her even more. And they did try and stop her. They would talk to their father, but he was scared, I think, in a way, of not supporting Raine because he needed her so much at every level of his life. And before long, Johnnie would need his beloved Raine even more. One morning in September 1978, he collapsed at Althorp while working in his office. When, um, Johnnie suffered his stroke, it was a huge stroke, and for quite some time, it was doubtful that he was going to live. Raine threw herself into caring for Johnnie. She set up a vigil beside his bedside, and she was there day and night, but she was very, very territorial about him, and she was fighting for his life, and she felt that he did notneed to have his children there. I mean, one can only imagine how awful this must have been for Diana. The father she adored, first of all was taken over by this woman, and now this woman, when he was at death's door, was not letting her see him. And she was utterly powerless. Johnnie developed a serious infection that resisted all treatment. He slipped into a coma. She sat with him for four months, where he went into coma after coma, and they kept telling her he was dying, and she just would not let him, and she sat there holding his hands and telling him he had to stay. Raine was obviously there every day, and she got his favorite aria, Madame Butterfly, and she put the earphones, the cans on him, and she played it... And she turned up the sound, and she was holding his hand, as she always did when she was there. And suddenly, he gripped her hand. This was the first indication that he was still alive and capable of coming back. Whatever her thinking was, she did, almost by her sheer bloody determination, pull Johnnie through that illness, and he came out the other side alive. I think Diana was absolutely thrilled that her father was still alive, but always in between them was Raine. Diana was unsophisticated. She wore jeans, t-shirts, jumpers. Raine wore high-heeled shoes, suits every day of life. So everything was very formal, and Raine was absolutely calling the shots. So it was difficult for Diana. Lady spencerhad a really difficult time with her stepchildren. I mean, you know, she so wanted to be accepted. One time when she was frustrated with Diana about something or other, and she would say, well, you know, I mean, she's never read a book in her life. It's very difficult. After you've finished talking about Duran Duran, there's nothing left to talk about. Well, that's not quite true. She did love to read mummy's books. Well, at least it was good grammar. By now, she had left school having failed all of her exams twice then moved to London to become a nanny. So the question was, what would she do next? Little did she know that behind palace doors, a match was in the making. When Charles and Diana got together, um, it seemed on paper that this was the most perfect match. At last the lonely princehad found his Princess, and here was this young 19-year-old who was glowing and looking very pretty and was now going to be a queen in due course. But Diana's childhood had been very difficult, and the happy, jolly-go-lucky veneer that she presented to the world was nothing more than a veneer. And Charles was a very complex character, and the two of them, you know, it was about the worst match you could possibly have made. Diana married Charles, the future king, on the 29th of July, 1981. Though still in poor health, it was a day Johnnie Spencer thought he would never see. Very well, thank you. I'd just like to say a word. May I say a word? Please do. The Spencers have, through the centuries, fought for their king and country. Today Diana is vowing to help her country for the rest of her life and she will have, at her side, the man she loves. The wedding was incredible, and it was one fantastic spectacle. I mean, millions and millions of people watched all over the world. And they fell in love with this sort of vulnerable, beautiful Princess. It was thanks to Raine that Johnnie was alive to walk his daughter down the aisle. But Diana didn't repay the debt, and Raine was sat away from the family. Now Raine was shunted right at the back, away from Johnnie, which she was incredibly upset about. Instead, it was Diana's own mother, Frances shand kydd, who took pole position at the front of the cathedral. Here is the stuff of which fairy tales are made. A prince and Princess on their wedding day. Raine soon shook off the snub. She was now a member of the royal family and determined to make the most of it. With Althorp on the tourist map, the visitors started pouring in. The wedding is when the house started to explode, and everybody wanted to come to visit. Coach parties after coach parties, literally from all over the world, wanted to visit and see where Diana grew up. And Raine soon spotted an opportunity to make the family's newfound fame pay. Raine decided that she wanted to have a souvenir shop, so I went down one day incognito and watched her serving. And she was like a sort of shopkeeper. She was just absolutely in her element, you know, bringing out all this hideous looking tat and trying to persuade these tourists to buy it. In the shop was photographs of her and Johnnie that were signed, loads of books that Barbara Cartland wrote. There was a copy of Diana's wedding ring, which she sold for £6.72. Lord Spencer had his wine shop, and he would stand in there and greet the customers, sign the bottles of wine. Raine loved it. It was her to a t. With the shop at Althorp booming, Raine and Johnnie branched out, hosting corporate events and romantically themed dinner parties. The invasion of her family homewas the last thing Diana needed. Just a year into her marriage with Charles, they were already drifting apart. She was just bitterly unhappy. She was disappointed in her marriage, as was Charles. I mean, it was, it was a car crash from the very beginning. And Diana used to take herself back home to Althorp and hide herself away in her room, but not see anybody. She was just really miserable. Poor Diana. I mean, she didn't have a solid family, she didn't have a mother. But Althorp clearly was home. Diana desperately needed someone close to confide in. Her mother was remarried and had moved away to Scotland. Her father was focused on making Raine happy. And she had now hit upon a new venture. What she found herself surrounded by at Althorp was a treasure trove... Wonderful paintings, wonderful silver, wonderful porcelain. So Raine had started offloading the artwork that didn't appeal to her. Raine set about selling in a very secretive manner. She would have favorite dealers come round very quietly, and they would quietly do a deal. It was a way of making money, but also she loved a good clear-out. You know, there would be a set of chairs made for the house in 1716 for the 2nd Earl, but she would sell the lot to give a ball. They sold a lot of beautiful candlesticks and chandeliers. She also didn't like religious paintings that she sold for a pittance because she didn't like them. Diana apparently saw one of her most favorite pictures in an antique shop, and she couldn't believe it, she was absolutely furious. The Princess told me, she told me, "they hate her, they hate her at Althorp. She's done this, she's done that, she's sold this, she's sold that. What's she doing? She's ruining the house." But she said, Peter, you know, I mean, they don't realize. You know, they don't realize that to keep a house like this going costs a lot of money, and occasionally they had to sell things to fix the roof, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, children don't know about this. All they see is this lady who is not our mother selling our inheritance. And as she would say, you can't eat the rembrandts on the wall. You need liquid coming in, and it pays for the butler. As the rift at Althorp widened, the press jumped on the story. The perfect Princess now had a wicked stepmother, and the media coined her new nickname, acid Raine. Raine, being the wicked stepmother, who'd done all this to Althorp... I suspect she became the one thing that Diana could vent all her hatred on. And Diana's loathing for Raine would boil over as the Spencer family gathered at Althorp in 1989 for her younger brother Charles's wedding. Diana's mother, Frances shand kydd, had joined them from Scotland. Raine and Johnnie were playing hosts, and of course Barbara Cartland wasn't going to miss out on a party. They'd had afternoon tea, um, with Mrs. Shand kydd. Suddenly Diana flew into a rage, convinced that Raine wasn't paying her mother enough attention. And it happened on the topof the saloon stairs. She had a furious row with Raine because Diana was so upset that her own mother had been ignored in the ancestral home, and she pushed her, and Raine fell down the stairs. She was badly bruised and was dreadfully upset. It was not justified at all. It was a cruel, heartless thing to do, and I think it was Diana's perception of how Raine was treating Mrs. Shand kydd. I think Diana was very stressed. This sounds really... wrong, but she wasn't center of attention on this occasion. Diana was finding it increasingly difficult to balance the pressures of royal life. I could see the cracks in the marriage between Charles and Diana getting wider and wider. Diana confided in me that on the night Harry was born, she cried herself to sleep. She said, "I knew my marriage was over." And the prince told the princessthat his duty was now done. He'd provided her, the country with an heir and a spare, and he could now resume his relationship with Mrs. Parker bowles. In 1992, the press released embarrassing transcripts of intimate phone calls between Charles and Camilla and Diana and a new lover. A shocked nation learned the fairy tale wedding was a farce. And then later that year, Diana's beloved father, Johnnie, died suddenly of a heart attack. The Earl's death was a tragic shock for his family. His wife and his son and heir, seen leaving the north London hospital tonight, were not with him when he died. They believed he was recovering from a bout of pneumonia. I'm afraid, because we all thought he was fine, my stepmother was at home overseeing something, and I was at home with my family. And I very much regret, and it's a matter of regret for the rest of us that, um, nobody was with him when he died, but he died instantly. Raine had been at Althorp overseeing guests at a private function. When news of Johnnie's heart attack came through, she had rushed to London, but it had been too late. I went up to Althorp, I had to ring the bell, and I had to ask, I need to get some clothes to send down to London. And I was escorted to the wardrobe room by the then housekeeper, and I said to her, what do you think I'm gonna do? Put a Van Dyck in the suitcase? For goodness' sake! I mean, I'd been in an out of that house every day for nearly 20 years. And that night Raine phoned me, we were probably on the phone for three hours, and she was just reflecting over... I'm sorry, I'm gonna cry. Sorry. She was just heartbroken... As we all were, um, and... It was a very sad time. And, you know, that was it. Her life at Althorp had finished. Johnnie had wanted Raine to have at least six months to stay on at Althorp while she sorted her affairs, but in time-honored fashion, it was the new Earl who now ruled... Diana's brother Charles. She was out immediately. Charles sacked a lot of the staff that had been specifically for her and her maids, and she had to get out straight away. I did go the next day to pack more stuff for her, and again I was escorted by the housekeeper. By now, Diana and her brother Charles were back at Althorp, personally overseeing matters. There was lots of sort of personal bits and pieces, and I was stopped by taking, I was taking the suitcases out, and there was a Louis Vuitton suitcase, which was lord Spencer's. It had "js" on it, and I'd got another one with "rs" on it. But they were their suitcases. And they grabbed the suitcases and said, "they don't belong to you. They're my father's." And the contents were stuffed into black bin bags, thrown out on the tarmac. The Spencer children had finally got rid of their stepmother, and the 9th Earl set about wiping away every drop of Raine from his family home. My taste and my former stepmother's taste, it doesn't coincide very often. What we will be doing in hereis just toning down the gilding. It's very, very bright. This was the taste that my former stepmother had, was for things to glisten and shine. If you are tackling a house like this, you do need expert advice, and some people are better at taking advice than others. Meanwhile, Raine was out, but far from down. On the contrary, she'd found an adorable French count. She felt, quite rightly, that life was for living, and when she met Jean-francçois de chambrun, she fell in love. And as far as she was concerned, this was the next episode in her life. 13 months after her ousting from Althorp, Raine married Jean-francçois de chambrun, and another chapter in Barbara Cartland's book had begun. She'd been so many people, you know... The honorable Mrs. Gerald Legge, lady lewisham, countess of Dartmouth, countess of Spencer, countess of chambrun... You know. She wasn't interested in looking back. That wasn't her at all. On to the next. But for Raine's former stepdaughter, things were going from bad to worse. She'd officially separated from Charles and authorizeda "news of the world" journalist to write her biography. It suddenly told the world in no uncertain terms that she was a very unhappy woman and had a very unhappy marriage, that she'd had dreadful bulimia, that she'd tried to commit suicide, that she was a self-harmer. Um, it all came out. I think Diana herself was a bit lost at that time. A lot of her friends, she would just drop for no apparent reason, and her family suffered the same kind of treatment. Now, in her hour of need, Diana would shock everybody by turning to the most unlikely of allies. Diana was fully aware of what she was doing. She knew that this was a u-turn day. She knew the Spencer family would not be very happy. But she couldn't care less, because she thought it was time Raine came back. Diana, now separated from Charles, took up residence at Kensington Palace. With her life in turmoil, she turned to the most unlikely person for support. So the Princess said to me, I'm going to change the rules, Paul. What I'm going to do is something which my family won't like. I'm going to invite Raine to lunch. Diana contacted lady Spencer when she was married to Jean-francçois de chambrun and invited them both to dinner at Kensington Palace. Jean-francçois was confused because as he knew it, these two women hated each other's guts, and what sort of a dinner are we going to have? So, they presumed there was going to be more company, but when they arrived, there were just the three of them. Of course, I was there, I was there at lunch when Raine came, and it was a very emotional day. Diana at one end of this long dining table, Raine at the other, Jean-francçois in the middle, trepidation all round. And during this dinner, Diana got up, said to Raine, "I have to thank you. I know you loved my father deeply, and I have to be grateful for all the love and the years of happiness you gave him." And Diana's eyes were welling up. Raine is in the same predicament. And apparently, they just ran together hugging and crying, and Jean-francçois is looking on in complete disbelief. And that was the beginning of their reconciliation, and they became so close after that. It was as if all the years of animosity had melted away, and Raine was back. Despite once being the most despised woman in her life, Raine was now regularly seen around town with Diana at her favorite haunts. During the next few months, the relationship between Raine and the Princess blossomed, it developed. Flowers, gifts, notes were constantly delivered backwards and forwards. I think Diana realized at last, you know, that the actual depth of this woman's advice and her character and her philanthropy, I think she really, really respected Raine. And at that time, she wasn't getting on at all with her own mother, so Raine slipped into that slot very nicely. She spoke to Raine on the telephone every morning. They had their morning call together, which was always, you know, set Diana up for the day. Raine didn't bear grudges, and she didn't want to revisit old quarrels and old difficult situations. And that gave her, in life, a very upward curve of energy, because she was a kind of tonic. She sort of shook it all up. And in 1996, Raine and Diana's lives became even more entwined. Raine and Jean-francçois divorcedafter just three years together. Meanwhile Diana divorced Charles and was stripped of her royal highness title. Diana decided she would give a party at Kensington Palace to prove that hrh or no hrh, um, she was still Princess Diana. And she asked Raine if she wouldhelp her organize it. And during that party, Muhammed Al Fayed was there, and Diana called Al Fayed over to Raine and said, now, Muhammed, this is the lady you should engage to help run your store. She can run anything. The next day there was a telephone call from Mr. Al Fayed, making her an offer she could not refuse. Aged 66, Raine had a new position at harrods. Although an executive post, she still couldn't resist helping out on the shop floor. She loved her job at harrods, and she used to love doing the harrods sale. She actually used to work at the till, and she would roll up her sleeves and get on with it. She was on the shop floor... "This color will suit you." I saw her once in harrods, walking across the floor, and she did have that large bouffant hair, which made a tall woman even taller. Your eyes just had to follow this vision across the room, and you were just thinking to yourself, gosh, that really is style. I'd often drive Diana to harrods, and it was as if, oh, come into my store, Diana. You're most welcome. Have anything you want, Diana. While Raine was working for Muhammed Al Fayed, Diana had started a new relationship with his son, Dodi. When news reached Diana's mother, Frances, she was outraged. The last time Diana spoke to her mother, I could hear this sobbing from her room upstairs. I ran up the staircase. She said, "come quick, come quick, listen to this." Her mother was berating her for being seen around town with Muslim men. "You're nothing but a prostitute and a whore. That's all you are. That's what I've brought up, a prostitute." And the Princess was sobbing, she said, "if you say that once more, I'm going to put the phone down, and I'll never speak to you again," and that's what she did. In August 1997, news broke that Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed had both been killed in a car crash in Paris. This is a cardthat Raine sent to my wife and I on September the 4th from farm street. "Dearest Peter and irmgard, I'm devastated over Diana, especially as she was so happy with Dodi. I pray they are both with my beloved Johnnie. Very affectionate, Raine." Raine and Diana's friendship had been cruelly cut short, yet in the years that followed, Raine battled on with her life, and in her own unique style. She needed to get out, she needed to be among people, she needed to be doing things. I mean, she was wonderful. She was absolutely... Socially, she was just great fun. Just as she had been in the 1950s, Raine was still the go-to spokesperson on high society and was back in front of the cameras. Thank you. The great film actor Spencer Tracy once said, "when I die, I do not want to go to heaven. I want to go to claridge's." Raine remained an ever-popular face on the social circuit well into her eighties, but then she starteddisappearing from parties early. Raine didn't really talk about anybody's illness, least of all her own. And it's something she studiously tried to avoid. And one day she did say to me quite matter-of-factly, "I've got a little bit of cancer, dear, and it's spread to the bones." Well, as a doctor, I know exactly what that means. She wouldn't have mentioned being ill to anyone ever, because being ill was a downer, and that was not somewhere she wanted to go. Raine carried on, and even aged 87, was still organizing big parties. Well, it wasa dinner party at Spencer house, and she'd invited about 30 of her closest friends. And we'd come in, and there she was, full of beans, huge hair, huge skirt. After the meal, instead of speeches, she just started to talk about each of the people sitting around the table, and she wanted to say thank you, really. But none of us realized at that dinner that this was, had been very meticulously organized as a farewell party and really was her way of saying goodbye to her close friends. Raine died a few weeks later on October 21st, 2016. Her life had been one of British high society's greatest adventures, and she is undoubtedly the missing link in Diana's story. Well, I think I did say in my eulogy, we'll not see her like again. She was very much a pioneer in many ways, and I think Diana recognized that and probably respected it because Raine had created herself, and Diana had to create herself, and both of them did a rather good job in the time that was allotted to them. We will never see the likes of Raine again. We will never see the likes of Diana again. Two formidable women of our times, who found support, strength, and love in each other. Raine was the most intriguing, intoxicating woman. She taught me so much about life, and I can only say that I'm very proud to have known her. Was she a pantomime dame? Was she a force for good? Was she the evil stepmother? Or was she the femme fatale? She was all of those things. What she wasn't was dull.
