Double shot latte with oat milk and agave. It's on me. In honor of your promotion. It's not even certain yet. Oh please, you're the best thing about this place. Besides, we both know what you're like before your second morning coffee. Mm. Thanks, Sammie. Special delivery. Good morning, Tam. Is that the offer? Yes. I just don't know, Tam. Oh, that's ok. You don't have to decide now. But let me just tell you what I know. This is everything you've asked for and then some. This deal honors everywhere you've been while providing growth capital for all the places you want to go. How does Chloe feel about it? Well, she's excited for me. She says I should do it. When my daughter was little, her first bike had a basket in front and she spent the better part of a year delivering bobbles and bits to our neighbors. The joy she brought with her deliveries was the inspiration for Chloe's Couriers. And she was my first employee. She's a dentist now, go figure. She must be really proud of you. You worked hard for this. If you need more time to think it over... No. That won't be necessary. I'm ready to sign. It's a good deal. A great deal. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you, Mr. Silva. This came for you. It's not every day you get a brown paper package tied with string. It's from Mom and Dad. You're never too old for a little goodie box, right? Anything else? Amelia wants you in her office. Pronto. Don't worry, she makes a cappuccino nervous. I'm not nervous. Oh. You wanted to see me? Yes, please, sit. What's in the box? Oh? Uh, they... they've gone bad. Oh, no, no, no. These were picked last night and shipped overnight delivery by my parents. They're Knobbed Russets, they're supposed to look like that. Go ahead. Try one. Well, I... I think this may be the ugliest apple I've, I've ever seen. Yes. And the sweetest one I've ever tasted. They're an heirloom variety. Haye's family orchard specialty. Um, how did it go with Silva? Oh. Oh, yesterday he was out the door, and today... Signed, sealed, delivered. He's in. I'm not surprised. You have the magic touch. And soon you'll get a chance to prove it to the Board. You mean? Mm-hm. They've set a date for the next pitch meeting. You have two weeks. That's great. I have the perfect company. No, not a company. You. Sorry, what? You're not pitching an acquisition, you are pitching yourself. They want to know what you'll bring to the company as partner. Are, are you ok? Yes, yes, it's just, companies I can do, but... Talking about myself it's, it's not really my thing. I'll let you in on a little secret, ok? You need to find three adjectives, three little words to describe yourself. It's basic marketing, really. Ok, sure. Mm-hm. It's um, organized, punctual, reliable. Uninspiring. Look, you need to dive in deep and find a you-ness that makes you, you. Find that spark, the seed. You need to go home. Home? No, I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, I can. You have two weeks to find the best words you can think of. And remember, the Board likes people who are real, vulnerable and raw. And also perfect. So, perfectly imperfect. Exactly. Ok. Well, thank you. And Tam, I'm your biggest fan and I support you 100 percent. So, don't mess it up, okay? Thank you. You can have the rest of these. How did it go? Great. Fantastic, amazing. Ok, let's call Mom. Hi, Mom. Quiet, peaceful, charming. Can I help you? What? Is it Tamara Hayes? Grant, hi. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you're in luck. In front of us we have a real city slicker. Who, rumor has it once made a Goldman Sachs himself cry. Well, Goldman Sachs isn't actually a person. It's two people, Goldman and Sachs. Neither of whom I made cry. Really? Learn something new every day. Right, Even? Yeah, I suppose so. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Your parents leased us a few acres. How long's that been going on? About six months. That's funny, they never mentioned it. I see you brought your fan club. Yeah, kind of. Grant and I are teaching a sustainable agriculture class. You're teaching? You've been talking about that since we were kids. Yeah. You look good. You look so different. Oh? I mean, older. Oh. I mean, like in a good way. Grown up. What's the occasion? I'm up for partner at the firm. Ah, that doesn't surprise me. Here to celebrate? Oh, no. I've been sent home. You say that like you've been sent to your room. I have to prepare a presentation about myself for the Board. I get three adjectives to describe myself. Three? I can think of 20 at least. Well, good luck with that. It's nice to see you back. Yeah, well, see you around. Wait. Um, what might they be? If you had to describe me in three words? Stubborn... as... heck. I will make note of that. Happy to help. Same old town, same old Lewis brothers. Did I see sparks? You might see stars if you keep it up. Hey, everyone, who wants a lesson in how not to speak to girls? Oh! She's here! Mom! -Hi! -Bring it in here! So, good to see you. Oh, I've missed you guys. Oh, we missed you. We can't believe you're home. Oh wow, Mom this is beautiful. There's lemon bars and tea, and for dinner I'm making your favorite. Grilled cheese and tomato soup. Ahh. Oh, it's good to have you home. It's good to be home. The new build looks amazing. I love it. I'm so glad you like it. It's come a long way since you saw it last. And thank goodness it's over. Our kitchen was in shambles for months. Oh! Ok, well I have a game plan. The orchard is first and then Grandma's shed is a must, obviously. Huh? Remember? To find my essence? Yes, of course. Your work thing. Yes, of course. Dad and I pulled some boxes from the shed. So photos, mementos, old projects will be in your new room. Mm-hm. We're here to help. Thank you. Huh? Construction must have left that behind. Oh, yes. I've been meaning to return it. Well, you better get started. Sounds like you have your work cut out for you. Hm. Mom. You preserved my room. Well, of course we did. We couldn't take down all this magic. I'll leave you to it. Some might call me a go-getter. Others might say overachiever. Oh! This feels like a later thing. I'm never gonna find my three words. How's your project coming? Yeah, it's not. Think less. Feel more. I can still remember you knee-high on a step stool. Insisting that your Grandma Mary let you measure every single cup of sugar she put in her apple pie. You've always been a force to be reckoned with. Ah, if Mary could see you now. Thank you, Dad. I don't know if the Board is particularly interested in Grandma's pies. Why don't you try walking the orchard once more? That usually does the trick. Again? Can't hurt. Besides, in your journey to find yourself, wherever you go, there you are. What? Mom. Did you find yourself yet? What is this? I... I guess we ought to tell you. Rappled Apples is shutting down. And no other distributor is willing to buy and sell heirloom varieties. The whole town is feeling the pressure. Planting new varieties, cutting down old trees to make room. You can't cut down the Knobbed Russets. Your father and I are in talks with a new distributor who's interested in buying Fujis. The ones that taste like cardboard? They aren't that bad. You can't find Knobbed Russets anywhere else. They're what makes Hermansville unique. They're a part of our family tradition. We didn't realize you cared that much about it. Neither did I. Well, I... I guess that's one thing that you're passionate about. Apples. Add it to your list. Tam's the business expert. Maybe she'll see something we overlooked. Tam? I think she should focus on one project at a time. Hello? I am right here. At any rate, the three of us will never forget what Grandma started, and that's what really matters. I'll figure it out. I just need the books. I've been trying to get in touch all day. Oh, yeah, sorry. The service has been spotty. Well, Chad Hughes is up against you for partnership promotion. Chad Hughes? He started at JDS after me and he has never closed a major deal. Yes, but Chad's father plays golf with Bob Kent. As in Chairman Bob Kent. Tam, take your hands off your face. Listen, I could have hired a Harvard MBA with baby blues, but I chose you instead. Do you want to know why? Because you went to Yale? Yes, but more importantly, you were the right person to grow this company. I know it, you know it and now the Board needs to know it too. So, will they know it? They will know it. That's what I like to hear. Jeez! Even Lewis! Do we need to start locking the doors? Tree medicine. Got to keep it cold. Some light reading? Account ledgers. Story's a little dry but I am worried about the ending. Tamara Hayes tackles another project? I can't let them cut down Grandma's apples. Ah, the Knobbed Russets. There's never been a sweeter apple. Or an uglier one. Find anything? Not yet, but I will. What about your presentation? The one you were sent home to prepare? Your partnership pitch? Yes, what about it? You sure you have time to save the Knobbed Russets and discover your true self? Seems to me like something's gotta give. I disagree, I think there's plenty of time for both. No offense, Tam, but you're kind of known for sticking your fingers in too many pies. Pie. Huh? That's it. That's the way in. What are you talking about? We all know our apples are great. There's no doubt about it. But, what we need is a brand. Ok, so the Knobbed Russets aren't selling on their own. But if we make them into pies, I mean, who doesn't love apple pie? Here we go again. This is exactly what I was talking about. Grandma came to the states with nothing. Look at what she built. And now we fight for her legacy. With pie. Apple pie. I just need sugar. Honestly, I can't believe I didn't think of this before. Running this place is harder than it looks. A pie isn't just gonna... That's salt. Please, I grew up here. Yeah, but you were a kid. You didn't pay attention to orchard management. I know about cost accounting, Even. The orchard is a business, just like anything else. Exactly. So then you know that we could never make enough pies to even make a dent. What's going on down here? Pie. Apple pie. If we can't sell the product, then we change the product. I am gonna save the Knobbed Russets. What's all the noise? Pie. Don't mind if I do. I still need sugar, and where is the flour? On my shopping list. That's ok. I mean, we really just need Grandma's recipe. Oh, honey. She never wrote it down. It's lost. Oh. That's all right. I'll remember it. I can almost hear her little song. Can't we do this in the morning? Three words, Lee. Stubborn... as... heck. No, I can't sleep now. Imagine Grandma's apple pies inside grocery stores across the country. Would be something. It would be everything. Yeah, but our resources are stretched so thin already. I don't see it being possible. Your father's right. But, you know better than to let a challenge stand in the way of a dream. If you believe in this, we do too. We'll find a way. Morning, hon. Gotta pick apples! Hey! You're eating my prized apple. Sorry. How is it? This is the best Russet I have ever tasted. I didn't know they could get any sweeter. Honestly and truly, what is your secret? Well, I always listened to the experts and then do the opposite. Is that so? Yeah, it's not easy, but if you ignore good advice long enough, you'd be surprised how far you can get. Is that one of your projects? Yeah, that tree is sick and the paste is medicine. Does it work? You tell me, you're the one eating my prized apple. Incredible. Usually have the orchard to myself at this hour. Grant's more of a sleep till noon kind of guy. I didn't sleep a wink. I was up all night planning. I feel great. If you say so. We need more apples. Tam. We'll sell more apples inside of pies than we ever did by the bushel. It's always easier solving another man's problem. I get that you're excited, but you came home to solve one problem and now you're picking at another. What does baking pies have to do with your pitch? Maybe everything. These pies are my family legacy. Why does JDS want to know so much about you anyway? Don't you just buy and sell companies? If I make partner, my creative vision will influence the company's direction. They just want to make sure I'm the right fit. Oh, so it's not about who you are, it's about who they are. Like you said, I came home to solve a problem and then I found an equally important problem that also needs to be solved. I can do both. Fine. But you should know, we've tried just about everything to save these Russets. It's impossible. Yeah, you haven't tried pies. Ah, I see. Well, then who am I to stand in your way? Good luck. Hm. No such thing. Ugh. Buy Mom new coffee, contact... You all right? Yeah. So, you're really doing this? Yes, I'm really doing this. Then you might need my help rallying the troops. No, I don't need your help. Yeah, you might. I don't. Besides, you said this was impossible. Absolutely, it is impossible. But, it's for a good cause. Come on. Get in the car. Are you gonna help out or what? Come on. You're a child. Here. Seriously, here. Come on, Even, get it. Come on. Get it. Come on, man... Oh. Maybe aim a little lower next time. Me? Never. Right. I forgot who I was talking to. Hey, you said so yourself. Stubborn as heck. Oh, well. The other side of the street's looking a bit sparse. Why don't you focus on that instead of worrying about what I'm doing? Sure thing, boss. Do you two ever give it a rest? I mean, I would think after 30 something years you would learn to get along. He started it. I'm just saying... And you're not still upset about prom? Of course not. It's like a lifetime ago. We were practically children. Well, he still seems to give you a great deal of trouble, if you ask me. Well, luckily no one is asking you, Mom. Don't! I think the two of you just like arguing. Get out of here. Hang your posters. Mia, surprise! Wow. Christmas came early. Jeez, I can't believe you found the time to drive down here. Uh... It's not the workaholic Tam I know. Tell me more. How would you describe the Tam you know. Say in like, three words? Um. What should we do with the extras? Oh, we can hand them out to people as they sit. Don't look at me like that. He's just helping. You mean you two are working together? Yes. Uh-huh. Hey, honey. You nervous? No. Uh, actually yes. Grandma planted these Russets with her own hands. And it's not just her, every orchard in the country was started by someone with a little dream and a lot of grit. The Knobbed Russets connect our past with our present. Mom, we cannot cut them down. Ok, honey. Ready? Mm-hm. Aim, fire. Hi. Um, thank you all for coming. I really appreciate you all being here. Those of you that know me know that I grew up here. Haven't been around much lately, but, home is home and I'm worried that our homes are being taken away from us because people can't help but judge an apple by its peel. My family's Knobbed Russets were planted by my Grandmother. And Mrs. Roy, everyone knows how your Grandfather's first purchase in America was a handful of Russet seeds. That's right, always said he wished he'd bought lunch instead. Less work. If we uproot the Knobbed Russets, we uproot our traditions and the legacy is lost forever. Legacies don't pay. No one buys our ugly apples anymore. Our apples are ugly, yes. But they're also delicious and the solution is simple. And sweet as pie. Apple pie. If we band together to sell pies made with our families Knobbed Russets, we have a fighting chance. We can establish a brand, make an impact. But, only if we work together. Any questions? What are you doing? Look, everyone, I know the pie idea's unique. Believe me, I was the first person to say no way. I mean, pies? Come on. But, Tam is the only one here addressing this problem. We all have a choice. We can look the other way or we can fire up our whisks and save generations of hard work. We all know Tam is full of elaborate ideas. Excuse me? But sometimes they really work and I think this is one of them. Tam's heart is in the right place. It always has been. So, all we need is a little sugar, spice and a whole lot of apples. Your grandma's apple pie was always the talk of the town. I'm in! Oh, um, sign here? Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Minnie. Um, just pass it around, I guess. Thank you. Mm-hm. Me too. I'm not sure what you said there, but thank you. Will? Mr. Sluctor, you have more trees than anybody here. What do you think? I think Mary Hayes kept her secret apple pie recipe locked up tighter than her liquor cabinet. You sure you can recreate it? Of course she can. We all know Tam helped Mary bake those pies. She measured out the sugar, cup by cup. That was a long time ago. Sure, but some things you never forget, right Tam? Right. Well, that would be something, all right. In all my years of judging apple day's blue ribbon pies, I still never came across one that's as good as Mary's. But, I'm in talks with a distributor who wants to buy Red Delicious. Mr. Sluctor. When's the last time you ate and enjoyed a Red Delicious? Business is business. We need your help. I'm sorry. My answer is no. Um. Anyone else? Oh, great. Thank you. Thank you. Nothing comes easy. Oh. Congratulations. Thank you. That's delicious. Thanks for your vote of confidence today too. Your support means a lot. And not just to me, to everyone else, too. Tam, you know I'll always have your back, no matter what. But this really needs to work. A lot of people signed up. It will work, you said so yourself. I believe in you, it's just, a lot of people are taking a risk. This valley was built with a few dollars and not much sense by people willing to bet on themselves. True. But, these day's it's a lot harder to get a second chance. What are you saying? If this fails... It won't fail. Tam. You don't know that. You're right, I don't. But I do know that fear of failure is the biggest obstacle to success. I'm just worried we got their hopes up. That I got their hopes up. Well, I believe this will work. And if you don't, then I will do it on my own. Oh! Oh. Amelia! Are you there? Hello? Hello? Hello? Amelia: Tam? Oh, yes, yes. Just let me step into my office. Tamara? Why do you sound like you're gasping for air? Me? No, that's just the breeze. Our big problem just got bigger. It's not just Chad's father golfing with Bob Kent, it's Chad himself. Oh, but Chad can't play golf. Exactly. Bob Kent loves winning. So, this is a disaster and I need you back in the office now. What? Yeah, we have work to do. We need to completely reinvent your image so you can compete with Chad so need you in the office. Psst! Even! Come here! What was that noise? No, no, didn't hear anything. Can you be here tomorrow morning? Amelia, you were right about coming home. I should stay. Yes, I've discovered some very important things here that need time to bake. I mean, develop. Yes, so my pitch will be great. Better than golf, I promise. It has to be the best they've ever seen. Oh, it will be. I'll call you soon with updates, bye. Comfortable? Extremely. Can't get this kind of view in your fancy corner office. I'd take the A train over this ladder any day. Uh, anyway. Back to work. Good luck. Oh, sorry, no such thing. In the handouts, which I am going to make, you will see the monthly revenue for each of the companies I've brought into the JDS family. Oh! Whoever said easy as pie has obviously never made one. Maybe there aren't walnuts in Grandma's recipe. Are you ok? Yeah, why? Oh, yeah, it's a long story. But, I think I almost have Grandma's recipe down. May I? Lavender? It's great, but I don't think it's in your grandma's recipe. Oh. There was a secret ingredient she swore by, but I can't figure out what it was. Love? No, that part was no secret. I was thinking scotch. Of course, only Mary would think of that. You remember what everyone called her? -Mary Queen of Scotch. -Mary Queen of Scotch. That's right. Try that one. Hm. Not quite. Oh, what is it? If the pies aren't perfect then the plan fails. I think they still taste great. Yeah, but not perfect. How many pies are you making? Not too many, just 100. 100? Well, yeah. I have to test all the possible ingredient combinations since I don't have Grandma Mary's recipe. Ok. What are you doing? Baking 100 pies. Together? Oh no. No, no. That is a recipe for disaster. I'm sorry for what I said. Our traditions are worth fighting for and you're putting up a good fight. I'm sure you've got it all under control. Wait. I could use a little help. Lot of help would be good too. Lot of help coming right up. Oh here, look at this. Oh. Always so poised. So beautiful. Yeah. I miss her. What? How did this old paperclip make it in here but not the recipe? We need a hint. One good sign, just one little... Clue. Yes, exactly. Her name is on the cover. Oh! Excuse me, ma'am, may I interest you in a tomato banana tart? Ew! Oh, wait. Look at these. Mayonnaise Jello? It's actually delicious. Ugh, stop. Ew, gross. They're all gross. Ew! Hey, wait. Apple slump dessert, best with top hats? That's what we call the apples that grow on the very top branches in direct sunlight. Grandma always talked about top hats but I never knew what she meant. Yeah, they have the shortest picking window but also the most sugar. Probably what made her pies so sweet. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? This one looks good. No, way too sour. In fact, I better eat all of these myself to save you from how terrible they are. What a sacrifice. Adventurous, driven, legendary? I'm not gonna tell the Board I'm legendary. Remember the time you re-planned the homecoming parade in one day after the cafeteria gave everyone food poisoning? That was pretty legendary. That is being resourceful. Hm, I like legendary better. Well, Amelia thinks I need to reinvent myself. That would be a tragedy. You know what, I'm just gonna go in there and give them the numbers. They love numbers. My work speaks for itself. But what about the three word thing? Great... team... player. Ok, anyone who thinks you can be described in three words doesn't know you very well. What do you mean? You're Tamara Hayes. There's so much more to you than those people will ever know. You can't be summarized. These will be ready in 23 hours. You know it to the hour? To the minute. You have not changed one bit. Neither have you. Still the same, Tam. CEO of big dreams. Yeah, I don't know about that. What do you mean? You're still gonna start your own business like you always talked about, right? Once upon a time, I tried to open my own urban bed and breakfast. What happened? Investors pulled out overnight. Three days before opening. It was over before it began. I'm really sorry. It's the way it goes. It's a long time ago now. But it's your dream. Was my dream. When I was a lot younger. I'm at the firm now. Don't give me that look! What look? That look you always give when you think you know better? Who me? Who me? Yes, you. Come on. Yes? Hi, Mr. Sluctor. How are ya? Great. What can I help you with? I just happened to drive by your place and I noticed you haven't cut down your heirlooms yet. When you happened to drive by my place did you notice the 'no solicitors' sign on the gate? I'm not a solicitor, Mr. Sluctor. I'm your neighbor. Regardless, I wanted to talk to you again about the idea I proposed the other night. Before you start the grafting process with the Red Delicious. Not interested. Well, if you have any specific concerns, I'd be happy to... I said, not interested. Good luck to you. Ok. Have a nice day. I'm delighted to be considered by the Board for this promotion. As you can see, I've brought in a lot of revenue for the company starting with my very first acquisition when I started. With my very first acquisition when I started my... no! My very first acquisition when I started at JDS has brought in the company a net sum of... Um, I had it just here. What is it? Three cups of.. That's not it! Maybe take it again from the top. What is the point? Chad is gonna get it anyway. Oh, honey. I've given everything I have to this job. I know it. Every hour, night and day, it's always Mom, I can't talk. I'm working. I'm sorry. I always thought it would be one hard year, maybe two. Then it would just be smooth sailing. It's been five. I know. What about the pie business? I can't remember the last time I've seen you that excited. No, I don't know if it will work without Bill. If Bill doesn't sign on, we'll need all the other neighbors to get on board. Or, maybe Even was right. Maybe I'm in over my head because I was trying to distract myself from my own problems. You think Even was right? Pigs must be flying. Yes, anything is possible, Mom. In love and war. I wonder if you really want this job at JDS? When you were a little girl, all you talked about was being an entrepreneur. And you had so many good ideas. Just like this idea to sell Grandma's pies. Common sense is all too common. Honey, you have a gift. Don't give it up so easy. But I like my job. Are you sure? Of course. I know you'll follow your heart in all that matters. Work and otherwise. Stop. What about candied ginger? Oh, spicy. Sure, just not a standard apple pie ingredient. My grandma always swore by maple syrup in her pie. Yeah, I tried that one. It was delicious but it just didn't taste like Grandma Mary's recipe. My favorite thing to put in my pie is my fork. I'll see you guys after my class. Maybe one of my students will have a suggestion for ya. Thank you. You gonna get that? Nope. Have you spoken to Grant much? Yeah, every day. Has he said anything about me? What's going on? I don't know, it's Grant. I can resist everything except for temptation. Ah. I think about him all the time. Except for when I'm with him, I can't think at all. I'm sick. Love sick. Yes, yes, I've seen this before. As the heart fills, the brain empties and pretty soon you are smiling like an idiot. How much longer? A week, maybe two. Oh. I knew it. So much for the single life. You know the craziest thing? As nervous as he makes me, I feel the most comfortable when I'm with him. I don't know. Hard to explain. No, I get it. I do. You do? Are you referring to Even, your friend or Even your sparring partner? We are not that bad. Yeah. You go together like oil and vinegar. Whatever. Saved by the bell. I don't need saving. I just need the secret ingredient. I've been looking all over for ya! Me? They're ready. Come on. What's ready? Think about it. Tam's Pie House, serving heirloom apple pies. You'd be your own boss, doing something you love and supporting the community. Yeah, I don't know. Remember this? Our old fishing spot. Your dad always knew how to find 'em. I come out here occasionally to talk to him. Sometimes it's a sunset or the breeze but I feel like he's here. He could always predict the perfect sunset. How did he do that? He knew everything. And even when he didn't, he still did. It's true. Why not? What? Tam's Pie House. It could be great. I was thinking my parents would take over the pie business once it's up and running. I mean, it would be great income for them. I also have a job and a very resilient house plant to get back to. Well, if that's what you feel is best. Even, can I ask you something? You have traveled the whole world, but you ended up here. Why? This place is a part of me, and I like to think I'm a part of it. I went traveling to study different organic agriculture techniques so I could be a better teacher. Everything I learned out there I brought back here. Think it could have really made a difference. What do you mean could have? The college is pulling the funding on our class, turns out sustainability is a luxury when money is tight. Even, I'm so sorry. Yeah, we've been expecting it for a while now. We tried our best. Truth is, I could travel the entire world but this will always be home. Ok, which one? How about this one? Oh, sorry. No, please. After you. Ok. Oh, no, you, ah... No. Please... You go... You go ahead. Ok. After you. Ok. It's perfect. Well, I don't know about perfect. Ok, well that is really good. I mean, I don't want to take the words out of your mouth. No. This was exactly how Grandma's used to taste. Yep. Right to the minute. Well what are we waiting for? Let's pick some apples. Yes? That's where you caught that huge fish. Oh yeah. It was as tall as me. And that's where we watched the meteor shower. No, it was over there, by the trees. No way. It was by the shore. I remember, the sand was freezing. No way. It was over there, by the trees, because I remember an apple fell on your head when you tried to kiss me. Ok. You're right. It was by the trees. Oh, we had some fun, didn't we? Yeah, we really did. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if you hadn't stood me up for prom. Yeah, I think about that a lot. You do? Yeah, especially lately. I waited and waited. And then for days after, I waited for you to call. But eventually I had to leave for college. I just never really understood what happened. I was afraid. Of what? I don't know. The future, getting older. You won that fellowship and had all these big plans. I still don't understand. There was always the next thing. I told you, you're Tam, CEO of big dreams. I was afraid that I couldn't keep up. That I'd get tossed aside. Even, I never would have done that to you. I know. I should have trusted you, and there's not a day I don't regret it. I went to see you. I wanted to apologize so I drove down to your campus. But you were with someone. He seemed nice. You looked happy. What did he look like? Freckles, glasses. Alex Gardner. He was nice, but we were only together for a few weeks. What happened? Just never got that spark, you know? Yeah. You know, Apple Days has a dance on opening night. What do you think? We can give it a go. Apple days? Yeah, it starts Friday. And we can have funnel cake. And play ring toss. Oh, everyone knows that game is rigged. Which only makes it better when you win. Well, you do owe me. Yeah, I certainly do. Ok, it's a deal. This reminds me of one of those afternoons when we used to run around the orchard and swim in the lake. Ugh, I can't believe we used to do that. What? Well, the water's freezing and who knows what's lurking down there. When was the last time you swam in the lake? Don't know, but it has not been long enough. What do you do on hot days? Sit by the AC, drink some ice water. Tamara Hayes. No wonder you can't think of your three perfect adjectives. Need a little lake swimming to clear your head. Is that so? Here's three words. Absolutely no way. What are you doing? Suit yourself. Swimming in the lake has nothing to do with my project. And that's where you're wrong. Everything here is a part of you. Part of your story. Especially this lake. Don't splash me! I'm telling you, there was something lurking in there. Right, right where we were swimming. Oh, 100 percent. Yeah. -I felt it. -You felt it! That's why I told you, I did... Ms. Minnie. Hi, Tam. Uh, I was hoping to talk to you in person. I've been doing a lot of thinking. You know how I grafted a couple of Gala trees in the orchard three years ago? Well, we're harvesting our first crop and, Tam, there are a lot more apples on those trees than on the Russets. We've decided it's time. We're replacing the rest of the Knobbed Russets with Galas. We just can't afford to take the risk. I'm so sorry, Tam. No, It's not your fault Ms. Minnie. Business is business. Mrs. Roy called, she's out of the pie business too. Oh look. It's the deed of sale. Sold 1956 to Mary Louise Gatzke. You know, she was the first woman in the valley to buy acres on her own? And seven years later, she had a fully-grown orchard. That's fast. Especially from seed. I wish she were here to shake a finger at Bill Sluctor. Yeah. If he would change his mind that would change everything. You knew you were in trouble if she shook her finger at you. What was her famous line? I'm not young enough to know everything. All this reminiscing is making me sleepy. Yeah, me too. You know, if you get hungry, there's plenty of pie in the fridge. Thank you, Mom. Where? It was lying under the papers, waiting to be uncovered. "Today the rain tried to uproot my saplings. "A bolt of fabric saved my tender friends. "A triumph, but now my shoes are ruined." That's classic Grandma. "I saw Sam at The General today. "Somehow that man is always smiling. "Even when nothing is funny. I am going to marry him." That's Grandpa. She was quite the romantic. Yeah, I guess she was. I want that one day. What she and your grandpa had. Yeah, their love was timeless. Can I see? Yeah, of course. Sam's favorite, two cups of sugar plus a little more. Three pounds of top hats, two cups of... That's the recipe! What's up? I just wish we would have found it earlier before everyone dropped out. Maybe then they'd see that this will actually work. Everything's not lost. At least we get to keep a part of the orchard's history, even if it's just a small part. Growing up I always heard that Grandma's pie recipe was blue ribbon worthy. I wonder how it would hold up today? Bill Sluctor has been judging the Apple Days baking competition since before we were born. If he says that your pie is as good as Grandma Mary's original then... Then everyone else will follow. Yeah. Winning the blue ribbon would be such great publicity. I can see the business plan now. All right, here goes nothing. Oh no, it's past the deadline. Who says? Yeah, look. We're too late, we missed it by a day. No, there's still time, we just need 400 signatures for a late entry. How are we gonna do that? Tam, Tam, I'll sign. Me too. Good, that's great. 398 left to go. Ok, so we go door to door. And I'll post it on my vlog. Three words. Comment, like, subscribe. You only got 12 views on your last video. I know! My following's really growing. It's not the end, Tam. I appreciate it. But the fair is in two days. This was our last real hope. Let's just go home. Wow, I mean, wow. That's exactly. It's incredible, sweetheart. You did it. You recreated Grandma's recipe. Turns out Tam was onto something with the candied ginger. It was the secret ingredient. This is a winning pie, Tam. Honestly. I suspect the Lewis brother apples made all the difference. I'd like to take the credit, but this was all Tam. I'll take the credit. It's not quite right. Something is wrong. What? All that's missing is my plate. No, something is definitely missing. You're right. Something is different. But I followed Grandma's recipe to a T. I didn't miss one single grain of sugar. It's the pan. All the photos in the old cookbook we found had thin metal pans. She wouldn't have been baking on Pyrex. Of course. Her pan would have conducted heat differently. That makes a huge difference. Well, it's never going to be exact but this is very close and very delicious. Blue ribbon delicious. It just would have been nice to have one more of Grandma's heirloom pies before the Knobbed Russets are cut down. This is the greatest gift. Thank you, Tam. Hi. We just got a call from the college. They're keeping our class on the roster. No way! That's amazing. Professor Lewis, at your service. I can't believe it. We need to run down to the school and speak with the Dean. And reserve a classroom and send out the syllabus. Oh, there's just so much... Hurry, go! No, no, I'll help you here first. Go. You got work to do, Professor. Ok, we'll be back soon. Right behind you. Tam-Tam. Yes? Do you have something to do with that? No, not at all. Oh, come on. You know I know you better than that. Ok, maybe just a little. Thank you, Tam. Really. Don't mention it. This community needs that class. The Dean just needed to be reminded of that. Yeah, but how did you do it? I set him up with one of our corporate clients looking to make a modest donation. Dean Raddler's a tough cookie. But, I guess you're tougher. Oh yeah, and, um, when Even smiles, when he really smiles, he gets these terrible wrinkles. Well, you better hope it's not genetic. Oh, I'm not worried. It's just, I've just noticed he's been extra wrinkly since you've been around. Don't tell him I told you this, but he's been working on his dance moves for this Friday. Really? If he can get rid of those two left feet, Mia and I might have some serious competition from the two of you. See ya. Well? The truck's not turning over. That's not what I was asking. Yeah? Maybe it should be. Well? What's going on with you and Tam? I'm working here, you should try it. Oh, I've been working hard all day. Can you tell? Wow, yeah, looks like you need a break. Excuse me. So, Tam and Even. Check yes, or no? We're just friends. Even Lewis and Tamara Hayes will never be just friends. Yeah, well then what would you like to call it? Frenemies? Soul mates? Two people who can't keep their eyes off each other? I don't know. But it doesn't matter what I call it. It only matters what you call it. And I'm worried you're gonna mess it up. Again. Since you seem to know everything, you should know when to stop talking. I know a thing or two about my brother Even. And you haven't stopped thinking about Tam. Not for one second. If you care about her, and I know you do, it's time you say something. That's where you're wrong. Feeling something and saying something aren't the same thing. She has to go back. Ain't it funny? For all that hurry, she's not moving too fast. This is a second chance, brother. I don't imagine you'll get another one. And then, he was talking about how beautiful the view was. But when I agreed, I realized he was looking at me. You and Grant make the perfect pair. When you find the person who gives you that spark, don't let them go. It was just so unexpected. One second it's Tuesday morning and you have a flat tire and the next second you're falling for the goofy kid who used to lick icy poles for attention. There are no rules. You just follow your heart. What is she looking for? A metal pan. Just wishful thinking. Look! Ah! Oh! How did this happen? Well, I told my girlfriends in the quilting group, of course. I told Cam at the post office. Oh, and I think Grant told a few guys at the shop. Plus, the cafe, but... That was it. Well, I guess word travels fast here. And just in the nick of time. Evan! You're not gonna believe it. We are going to Apple Days! Did you do this? Who, me? Nah. But my students? Well, let's just say that they're pretty popular. They seem to know everyone in this town. Oh. How did you... Mrs. Roy had this lying around. Said she'd be more than happy to donate it to the cause. Couldn't stand to see you so disappointed. Just one more thing. Anything. How do I do this? You think you've got what it bakes? Get your apron. Now, we add flour and vanilla. Oh! No. You have a little just... Oh, you didn't. Oh, but I did. Don't do it! Don't! Stop! Stop! Stop! Amelia, hi. The Board has moved the pitch meeting up to first thing tomorrow morning. Do you know what that means? I gotta get back. If your pitch doesn't blow them out of the water, Chad is going to be your boss. No, that's not gonna happen. I'll be there with my three perfect words. Fantastic. And remember, perfectly imperfect. Right, I'll see you soon. Hurry. Is everything ok? They moved the pitches up to tomorrow morning. I need to get back to the city. I need my words. I need, I need, I need... What about the baking competition? It's tomorrow. We can do both. Are you sure that'll be enough time? I think we can have our pie and eat it too. I'm going to be back before you can blink. Don't worry. Just, good luck. And drive... Safe. Yes, Mom. See you guys. So I cleaned your windshield, checked your oil. Checked your tire pressure. Everything's good. Thank you, Dad. And Tam? One more thing. Whatever happens, just want you to remember that we're proud of you. Not just me and your mom, the community. Ok? Thank you, Dad. Ok, well you better hurry up. Looks like it might rain. Ok. Bye, everyone. Oh, for Amelia. Thank you. Hello. Now, don't let them know you're nervous. They can smell fear. I'm not nervous. That's perfect. Keep faking exactly like that. Ok. You are prepared, right? You have something amazing? You'll see. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. We can just get right to it, if you don't mind. Oh, thank you are prepared. I know you all came to hear about what I brought to the company. Salinger Medical, Chloe's Careers and my other investments. Outlined in the packet is their generated daily revenue. Daily? Tamara, why are you the right fit for partner? I'm glad you asked. The key to understanding who I am is understanding where I came from. I grew up on an apple orchard in Hermansville, just a few hours from here, where there's a whole community of farmers who grow unique heirloom apples. So, I understand small businesses. I know the struggle, the joy and the community that they can build. If you had to describe yourself in three words, what would they be? A leader, a doer, a friend. I am a daughter, a granddaughter, a creative mind, an out of the box thinker. A dreamer, a member of my community. Stubborn as heck. You want to know who I am? I am not the right person for this job. I hate golf. Conference rooms? Don't even get me started on board meetings. I don't want to make money for people who don't know anything about people. Or get so focused on dollars that I lose my sense. I want to chase dreams, my own. And, other people's. I want to help my community. Tamara? Thank you. I really appreciate this opportunity. But I quit. How'd it go? Couldn't have gone better. Oh, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen! Keep your eyes on the pie. Our most popular competition is starting now. I don't know. I think he likes it. Mm. Well, now the moment you've all been waiting for. The competition was stiff. The pies are tasty. My mouth is still watering. But, uh, whose masterpiece will take home the blue ribbon for the best apple pie in the state? It's time to find out. So, we'll get right to it. Third place is awarded to Pink Pearl of Wisdom. Second place goes to none other than the great, one and only, Opal's Rare Gem. Looks like there'll be a new state champion this time around. Finally, I'm proud to present the one and only blue ribbon for best apple pie to the incredible, inexplicable, magical, Mary and Tam's Knobbed Russet- Mary would be so proud. So, this is a momentous win for Ms. Hayes. A first-time competitor who found her Grandmother's beloved pie recipe in an old diary. And whose win only goes to show that, well, with a little sugar and a lot of grit, anything can happen. Thank you. As is traditional, any words from the winner? Oh. If there's one thing I've learnt, it's that this kind of success can't be achieved on your own. This ribbon isn't just mine, it belongs to everyone in Hermansville. Without their support, or their delicious heirloom apples, I wouldn't be here. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you. You did it. We did it. Tam. Yes? That pie was exactly like your grandmother's. Perfect. Thank you. I'm sure she'd be very happy to hear that. And you're sure that you can duplicate this pie? To a T. Well, you were right. Sometimes the reward is worth the risk. So, you can count me in. If you'll still have me? Yes, of course. I won't let you down, Mr. Sluctor. Can I hug you? Thank you so much! Thank you, thank you. Amelia? Tamara, darling, you left so fast I didn't get a chance to talk to you. Yeah, I had somewhere I needed to be. Is there any way I can persuade you to come back? Didn't I blow it? No, the Board loved your pitch. Especially the exit, that was genius. In fact, you're a shoo-in for the promotion. Amelia, I meant what I said. I can't accept this job. Really? I came home and I learnt who I am and who I am is not this job. You would have your own office, company car. Office and car aside, this is what you've been working so hard for for the last five years. You want this more than anyone I know. You deserve this more than anyone I know. You're not really gonna just toss that aside, are you? I don't know what else to say. I think you do. But the pie business, I want to help it along. What better way to help than to be a well-connected, power walking point of contact? You want to help your community? You take this job. I accept. I'll be there on Monday. Great. I'll see you then. Hey, I was trying to find you. Even, I have something to tell you. I'm headed out. What about the dance? What about it? I thought we had a date? I heard you on the phone, Tam. I know you're leaving. Yeah, I got the promotion. You promised. You promised you wouldn't toss this aside. That you'd see it through. This promotion is everything. I'll be able to provide invaluable resources for the community, can't you see that? Sure. I believe that you believe that. This is just so classic Tam. Moving on from one thing to the next. I don't know why I thought it would be different this time. What are you talking about? I am doing this for everyone. Yeah, I'll be in a different place, but I'll still be helping. The entire town changed their lives to take a chance on you, including me. I am trying to help. You're trying to leave. This is exactly what I was afraid about in the beginning, and I was right. What is this really about? You've already made your decision. There's no point in dragging this out further. Doesn't matter what I do, you will always choose to see things the way that you want to see them. I'm not going to beg you to trust me. Hey, Tam, you going so soon? Uh, yeah. You're not really leaving, are you? Um, I need to get back to the city, I have to get back for work. Oh, sweetie. What did he do? No, no, no, nothing. Um, I just have a lot to do. Tam, come on. Even's already spoiled one dance for you. Let's celebrate your victory. You worked so hard. Thank you, I love you. I'll talk to you soon, ok? Hey. You're making a big mistake. I appreciate you looking out for me but I did the right thing. Do you really believe that? If you let a woman like Tamara Hayes go, you're the one that's wrong. I'm tired of you sticking your nose in my business. You don't know the whole story. Sure I do. Tam opened up to you and you got scared. You've never appreciated her the way that you should and I'm sick of it. I'm not gonna let you hurt her again. You're supposed to be my brother. Evan, that's why I'm here. I'm trying to help. They told me you were going home? Yeah, I got the job. Well, that's amazing. There's so much celebrating to do. Yeah, I don't really feel like celebrating. Dad, am I doing the right thing? I don't know, pumpkin. But guess what, you do. What feels right? I worked so hard for this job and then I got home and everything changed. Trust yourself. After all, only you are an expert on you. But I'm not sure about anything anymore. You know what I always say about finding yourself. Wherever you go, there you are. Hey, you're not gonna let him go that easily, are ya? Dad, I don't think he wants to be with me. He's scared. All of us fools in love are when we have something to lose. If there's anything I've learned in all these years, it's that it's never too late to dance. Ok? I love you, Dad. Oh, I love you so much. Tamara? I really am flattered, Amelia, but I've realized I can't accept the job. This is the big one, are you sure? Thank you. But I think I found the big one here. -Tam! -Hey! Oh, honey. I'm so glad to see you. I'm sorry, Mom. I really thought I was doing the right thing. Never mind that. You're here now, that's what's important. So, how long are you staying? I think for a while. I knew it. Hey! Has anyone seen Evan? Ms. Hayes? Evan Lewis. You have no idea how glad I am to see you. I guess it's true what they say. Any man can make a mistake, but only an idiot persists. I was just so afraid that I would lose you, but I never meant to hurt you. Even, I will never leave you behind. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you. Can I revise my answer? Smart, beautiful, my everything. That's four words. One blue ribbon pie. Coming right up. Get back to work.
