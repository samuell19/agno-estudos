BREWERY Good evening. Comrade Commander! Comrade Commander! Wait ! Comrade Commander! Tolja! - Tolja! - What is going on ? Be more clear, finally! Lieutenant Kurochkin... He was shot! - He is alive ? - Who. The ball is close to the heart, but he is still breathing. - Where did you find it? - In the field. We were patrolling, and we heard gunshots. - It wasn't us. - Accelerate. - Sorry ? - What land? - Near the castle. - How far from the castle? About 500 meters away. We fired from the tower. The path of the ball is oblique. Aim for his heart at 500 meters. It is the work of a good shooter. - What a bitch! - Where are you going ? Soldiers, follow me! Stay there, and keep an eye out! - Where is the Commander? - Why ? - Is the German with him? - It does not concern you. - Stop! - He is alive ? Dirty little bitch! Bitch! The girl from the Comintern? - We fought with the Comintern? - The farm ! Listen, Comrade. snipers targeted Kurochkin. He's fine, but two other soldiers have disappeared. The girl has a callus on her index finger. She must be with the snipers. - You could have told me before! - You would have believed me? The Comintern... Fascist bitch! She attacked me in the act! But don't insult the Comintern. So according to you, it would be a sniper. - What did she want? - I do not know. snipers do not work alone. She was looking for something. For sure ! She even forgot his underwear. Get the hell out of me, fool! Give me that. Listen carefully, Yashin. find her, or I'll send you to the Gulag. Have I been clear enough? You know what he you still have to do, Lieutenant! - Yes, Commander. - Round up our men. - Search the surroundings. - A second ! - If there are more than two? - Never mind ! Execution ! Comrade, there will be unnecessary deaths. Yashin, you are Commander, aren't you? So order and don't bother me! Search the surroundings right now ! We absolutely need an anti-sniper unit. It's your job Commander. Break up! Half turn! Forward, march! Wait. No need to panic Mikhajlovsky with this sniper story. - Masha, are you there? - I am swimming in happiness! It's worth coming just for this bathtub. Finally Stanislaus! Nobody invited you. Just a minute! I believe the minute has already passed. So ? What do you say ? that I am not your wife. That's what I say. - OK. - And apparently... I will never be your wife. We will speak again as soon as we get back to Moscow. - You understand ? - Yes. But Frau Martha gave us separate bedrooms. We'll see you in Moscow, darling. In Moscow ! In Moscow, okay! - Goodbye ! - Goodbye ! Mysterious shadow! It's not nice to spy on girls. Stas? Where is he ? Stas! I am here, what is it? - Did you come down? - No why ? - Something happened. - What ? - Was that you? - I just arrived. I was in my bath. There was someone. However, I did not see anyone. Stay there, please. There is nobody ! What you saw ? There was a footprint right there. There was a footprint. I saw it. Where did she go? A man's shoe. You do not believe me ? - Yes, of course. - Do you think I'm crazy? Do you think I was dreaming? Comrade Yashin. What are you doing here at this hour? I came to see if everything was okay. We just need rest. Without it, ghosts come to haunt the house. Sorry. I wish you a good night. You dreamt. - Everything is fine ? - Yes. Thanks, that'll be fine. You're right. Come, Masha. Let's get some sleep. Come on, come to bed. Hello Masha. Breakfast will be served. Hello. Thank you. Yashin! Did you sleep well ? So come join us. Masha! Your brave tin soldier watched over you all night. - And in fact ! - Yes ? - Keep on going. - I missed you last night. I can enter ? Hello to you. Everything okay in the house? Yes thanks. You will have breakfast with us ? Thank you, I have to join the political police. Osipov wants to search around. So he ended up believing you? - Did you find Kurochkin? - Yes, we found him. You can take my car and discover the region. To change your mind. How nice. What's interesting? If you love architecture, you will be satisfied. Promise me not to approach the castle. - Yes okay. - Count on us. Goodbye. The ghost has not returned? No, but I'm convinced to have seen a footprint. Do not think about it anymore. - And There you go. - Thanks very much. What are you thinking about ? I think of Yashin. And if he wasn't the one what do you believe? I heard maybe it was a sniper. A well-known sniper. And that he had a girlfriend in Stalingrad, who was killed. This kind of story nothing original. Maybe. But... It saddens me. Osipov will make short work of it, you will see. I know these kind of men. Like the one who interrogated me after my father's arrest. We should help him. Masha. What can we do for him, let's see? we should go to the castle. Go please ! - Ask Osipov, he will accept. - Masha! Yashin asked us not to go there. You're scared, right? - Me ? - Yes, admit it. But no. After all why not. Let's go, my little one... Adventurer! Hold me in Your Arms ! - Do you have any matches? - Hold. - Thank you. - You're welcome ! Comrade Engineer, come! We found something. - Stay here. - I'm coming. - Certainly not. - I am coming with you. Stay, or I'll make you accompany immediately. I wanted to help you. If there are things to photograph, I'll let you know. Come this way ! Can you photograph me? It will be a memory. - And There you go. - Thank you. Soldier ! - Commanding officer…. - Later ! - How is Kurochkin? - We couldn't do anything. I operated on it myself. Everything seemed normal, but this morning... You must know something important. The ball that I pulled out bears a mark. - What do you mean ? - It was engraved. Glasses ! There you go, Commander. - My God ! - My glasses ? Commander, arrest the soldiers. There are two snipers in the castle. - They're dangerous. - I don't care about your snipers. What are they keeping there? Mikhajlovsky left there 30 minutes ago, with Guseva. Yet I had defended them! - Take over. - At your service. Half turn! To the vehicles! Walk ! Damn it ! I finally found it, yes! Take it down. - What are you doing ? - I saw something. What do you mean ? You should go see in the gallery, right? Wow ! It's brutally heavy! Stopped ! It's mercury! Put that down. Be careful, okay? Do you want to poison us? But what are we looking for? This. It's understood ? - Understood ! - Go for it ! Fire ! That's enough ! You come with us. Stop Bertha, you're going to waste bullets. Target reached! Who did you touch? I touched this girl. The one who looks like your wife. Witch ! - Snipers? - Yes. And the scientist? I do not know. And the girl, where is she? Answer! This time I will stay there. Where is the girl ? Do not advance! I said stop! Stop! Make a U-turn ! - You are crazy ? - There are snipers! - After the war ? - Step back! - And Mikhajlovsky? - Capture ! You are crazy! We are responsible for it! Advance! Stop, it's a trap! They will die for nothing! They have seen others. Go for it ! They are young. I was in Stalingrad, I know what I mean ! 1942 is already far away, and I know what I do. Ahead ! - We can go ? - When I give the order. Hey, come see! Lucky you! Fight back! Make a defense circle! Take cover! Covered ! Under the arch, quick! - Commanding officer ! - I am hurt ! Soldiers! Fall back! The others fled? No, they didn't run away. They were killed. All those kids, shot. How awful ! Here, I finished the bandage. Poor soldiers, dead for nothing. What carnage! A whole unit wiped out in two minutes! A sniper can perform five aimed shots in one minute. Minimum. So, if we take it into account... In two minutes, ten corpses. It means that they are more than two. Yes, and they are at war. Give it back, it's not yours. Give me that. You are a soldier, not a looter. You are right. Two minutes. Nice work ! - My commander. - Silence ! Let's go ! Advance ! Hurry up ! Get up, son of a bitch! Go on ! They left ? Oh no. They're hiding. They are aware of their strength, so they hide. They know we won't go look for them. stop spinning, you are going to be sick. I'll call the doctors, to evacuate the corpses. And the snipers, then? A sniper never shoots on a doctor. It is the rule. What are we going to do ? My men will come join us. We will not save Mikhajlovsky without them. - Wait, your men? - A group of counter-snipers. Kleist! Calm down, it will be over soon. We can leave this rat hole. Here it is ! Are you from Moscow, bastard? Answer! Calm down, Carl! Anyway, I'm sure that you are an important person! So leave it, Karl. - Otto Hammerboll. - Mikhajlovsky. Do you remember me ? Is this copy active? Welcome to my lab. I hope you came to see him. You are an expert. So make yourself at home. So take a look. In 1942, the same specimen went into space. What can I say ? Mikhajlovsky.. The Fürher was right. It's necessary believe that our race is superior. You will agree with me? Whoever designed the V2 didn't want not that you make a weapon out of it. We don't care about your opinion! That's enough. Occasionally, you may discuss it with my friend Danst. But I'm afraid that Karl Kleist has not been sent to carry out the Fürher's orders. What do you want ? You see, Herr Mikhajlovsky. We received very specific orders. The enemy must not recover in any case our equipment or these rockets. It's not easy to keep a factory with 10 snipers, especially when the enemy uses heavy artillery. You think my presence will stop them? That'll deter them for 2 or 3 days. It's enough. To do what ? You are too curious Herr Mikhajlovsky. Let's go, Bertha. Pay attention. Sit down. Thank you. You want some ? No thanks. Me, I want it! - What are you scribbling? - I'll show you. With these glasses, you look like a teacher. An exemplary job. Those snipers! The devil take them all! If only we could do intervene the naval forces! Stuck because of Mikhajlovsky. I have to watch the equipment! The documents also like the apple of my eye! Name of a dog ! I don't understand how all of this could have happened. - About like that. - What's this ? The plan of the castle, and the place from which they fired. - The red lines? - The shooting sectors. - And the dots? - The position of the snipers. - One, two… What? Ten snipers? - Yes, there were ten. Good work ! It's from a book on sniper training, written by Morozov in 1931. Looks like the shots can reach the whole area! No, there is a blind spot. There, under that arch. He's there ! !! is here ! Thanks for bringing us. Give me the accordion. Yashin, Yashin! We will meet in A hell of a mess because of all that! I'm telling you. What is that ? These are my men. To your ranks! The sniper group has arrived. Staff are present and operational. under command of Sergeant Major Ignatovich. These are your men, aren't they? It is a fact. Ignatovich is a sniper. Trap specialist. He served in the Finnish campaign. Derugin, sniper, master of hand-to-hand combat. Sergeant Vorobjev, specialist sniper engineering and demolition. Very well. Gentlemen, that's what it's all about. Eliminate the group of snipers that is in or around the castle. They prevent anyone from approaching. It's quite logical. The leader of the group is Karl Kleist. They hold Mikhajlovsky, an expert from Moscow. And the girl who was with him. - She is pretty ? - Avoid humor. - Here is the list. Study it well. - Understood. We are going to need anti-personnel mines. The mining engineers will help us. - If not, tell me. - At your service. Haven't seen you in a long time, huh? Two and a half years. I leave you to your reunion. Who, I checked everything myself. There will be no survivors among the Russians. We'll see. Coffee ? It's true, he comes from Brazil. Thank you. With Von Braun, we dreamed of sending our rockets to the Moon or Mars. You can smile. It seems crazy a rocket to Mars! But this dream made we were denounced, and arrested by the Gestapo. But Dornberg helped us and given a chance to continue. That's what we did, with the greatest pleasure. And now it's all over... Otto! Listen to me, Otto. You must get there as soon as possible. I promise you we'll leave you continue your research in Moscow. - What, at your service? - Yes. So that the rocket belongs to you? No. I have enough to work for others. I achieved all my goals as a scientist. The results therefore have no not important to you? Wouldn't you like to see them? This rocket has only one flaw, and not least. She can't hit her target precisely. The Fürher knows it, but he is not worried. London is a hard target to be missed. Then I succeeded to correct this defect. By experiences in my lab and calculations. I found the way to correct this problem. The only thing that I can't do, is to be able to test my own creation. But deep down, I'm happy about it! Mikhajlovsky! Petja, Boris, stay there. Mikola, with me! Commanding officer ! There is a sniper in the tree, near the river. There's another one at the window. Shoot at the bell. Put it down right now, Bertha. what happened to your wife? She died in the bombings of Berlin. Carl? What are we doing here? We will probably die. This war no longer has any meaning. We should go. Woman's words! But anyway, where do you want us to go? I do not know ! Hammerbol… !! was talking about going to Argentina. Without the documents, who would want us there? Hammerboll only talks about Mars and space exploration. He annoys me and I believe that he is hiding documents from me. But I think he's scared, actually. Everything is fine, there is only one day left. one day and we'll have everything we need. Even Argentina, you'll see. I want you to go see where are the others. I think the Russians will try to take the lab tonight. I'm counting on you, Bertha. There's one under the bridge. How are you, guys? - I'm here ! - Down ! So there's another one, on the balcony. Mikola, are you in charge? Boris! You serve as bait. Petja, you cover it. - Good evening, Commander! - Good evening. Why did you come? I couldn't stay all alone there! I could be of use to you. Alright, but don't you show not until I tell you! What are you doing ? I'm going to swim ! Courage, Boris. You think that they will stop everything, and no one will build this rocket? It will continue but without me. You are young. And you think you're right. Am I interrupting something? He thinks he's right about what, exactly ? Where are the building plans? Where are the documents? - Answer! — Here they are! Pay attention ! We will go together! calm, everything is ready for the explosion. I'll get the plans from this rocket, whatever the cost! Is that clear ? You won't be able to fool me. Gunther, what was it? Otto, you want to destroy the laboratory ? Nobody should only have these documents. No, I implore you! You, shut up! Karl, it doesn't have to come to that. I will take care of it myself. OK. Go for it ! Carl! Carl! They are there ! - The Russian experts? - Yes. Paul! Hammerboll, stick with Russian, I'll come back for you. And don't forget the explosion. Let's go. Boris, put a bomb in the staircase. The others, follow me. The scaffolding. Mikola, take care of the wall. Commanding officer ! One hit will suffice. From here we'll have a good view on the hallway. Go get the matches. Commander, in position. Shoot at my command. - What am I shooting? - The Germans ! - Go for it. - Stop ordering me around! Everything is ready ! A great surprise waiting for him up there! - Will it be long? - Whatever it takes. - And if I need to… - Wet your pants. - Don't talk to me! - Silence ! He tu me. Mikola, the door! Well ! - We were hot ! - Attention ! - What happened, soldier? - What did you do, Commander? - Petja! - Commander, right there… Cover us! No way you die. you must tell us about your clan. It was George. I am sorry. Incredible. This Russian sniper is an expert. He shoots from the balcony. Boris! Take care of the Commander. Watch the balcony. Mikola, there is a sniper straight ahead. The others are placed as on the map. I'll get Kleist. Here you are ! Take that! - Take ! Take this ! - Garbage! Commander, are you alive? Come ! - Do you know how to use it? - I'm not stupid. Follow me. You cover me. I'm going to find it again the sniper shooting at us. Standing. A woman ! Kleist! There's gonna be an explosion, is not it ? Yes. - Why ? - You are right. I can't stop the others. It's all stupid and makes no sense. Get off me! Hands in the air ! Osipov, don't do this! It's Otto Hammerboll! Otto, I would do anything for you. Join us, let's go! No need to be stubborn, you must live! Why do we have to wait for it? One day, you will eventually understand, what I understood. And the pill will be hard to swallow. This is the weapon of punishment. It's finish ? There, we will have seen everything. - Where is Masha? - I did not see her. Let's go. Yashin! You want to see me ? So come here! Where are you hiding, Yashin? We don't move! Looks like I missed you. Finally, it's even better! Come out of hiding, Yashin! Or I start by killing her, and then I kill you. If you show yourself I will not kill her. It would be a shame to damage my wife's dress. I haven't forgotten you, Yashin. I killed a lot of people, but none come back to haunt me. Where are you hiding ? You are a coward ! Show yourself ! Otherwise I'll shoot her! Turn around, Yashin! I want to see your face. - I want to be with you ! - Go away ! - Yashin! - Go away ! You're welcome ! Yashin! My love ! I have no one but you. I'm lost without you. My life has no more meaning if you're not here. I want to live by your side, I want to take care of you ! I love you Yashin! Run! Yashin, are you okay? Are you injured? You are alive ! You are alive! God be praised! How are you, Yashin? Where is Boris? He has been killed. Your guys were good men. I will never forget them. - Hammerboll is dead. - Do you have anything? Translation: Celine Lemoine Subtitling: Avril Vanlerberghe
