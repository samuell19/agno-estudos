Everyone talks about love. But the only examples I see are hate. Everywhere you look. They say to throw your love out there and make a splash. Maybe it changes something, maybe it doesn't. But I believe, eventually, that love ripples back. Vince. Vince. Vincent! Vincent, hey. You told Stephen you were gonna be his groomsmen. You committed. You committed. Stephen's groomsman. You've got yourself like an hour to get yourself cleaned up. No, I'm not going. Yeah, champagne is gonna be flowing. And Vince, You can keep that. Lena Carlyle. She's the maid of honor. Still not going. Wow. Wow she's hot. She's a fox. Is that Lena? Is that the line you use to make girls disappear? Because I think it's working. So are you happy? I just wish Mom and Dad were here. I wish they could see this. Yeah, me too. Well, you look beautiful, smile. Steven and Lily. Today you begin your journey together. Let's think about together. Together means to pick up the slack when your partner is slacking. At times, Lily, you must be his comfort. And Stephen, you need to be her strength. Becoming soulmates is a process. Ya know; be open. Right now, I don't have the strength. I need you. So this is what you call love? I don't know anymore. Well maybe, you should figure that out. I now pronounce you man and wife. Come on, kiss her! Woo! Yeah, Stephen. Mazel Tov! Namaste! Champagne. Hey, Paul. - What's up, Vince? - What's up, man? You'll never beat me to the booze, bro. No, give it here, give it here. Why else do we come to weddings? Oh, I don't know, fellas. Maybe for the vows or watching people fall in love. What's up, D'Qwell? Now I have a question. - Uh - huh. Who here is getting hitched next? Dude, Vince or Manuelo, man. I am never doing that. Marriage is a workshop. Where men work and women shop. What I'm saying, DQ, is that women are like ice cream from DQ, okay. They're really good to taste, but if you hang unto 'em too long they melt into a sticky mess. That's really gross. A woman's love is like champagne. It's sweet and the more it matures the more nourishing it is. Oh boy. - Uh - huh. Speaking of maturity. Happy birthday, Vince. Hey! Let's party, guys. Dirty 30! Dirty 30. Be careful with these old bones. Maybe in about 15 years or so I might start thinking about getting married. But on one condition. It's gotta be that woman. Voila. Mm mm. Thou vivacious vixen. Oh my gosh. Thou waxeth of Shakespeare. Thou waxeth of dumb. Dumb! D'Qwell. You're too much of a dog. Look, she's old enough to drink. Why is Vince staring at me? Probably because he thinks you're a fox. Or he's just being a creep. That's what I meant, Tara. The other one's cute, though. Ugh, don't waste your time, Tara. They're probably just over there talking about fishing. There's plenty of fish in the sea. Also, she's with Devon. Ah, that's a good point. That's true. Men, that is all they do is fish for women. Catch and release. Hey, Baby. Yes, Kadasha? I didn't say crybaby. Speaking of baby, what is it? Don't know yet. No ultra sound. Probably another boy. Mm. Hey, we gotta go pick up Kyson. All right, go wait by the car. I'm gonna see you soon, babe. Okay. Listen, do me a solid favor. No running around girl to girl. Be a decent guy. Okay, all right, yup. Love you, numb nuts. Love you too, man. All right, I've got an idea. Lay it on me. Let's drink all the champagne. We've already gone through two bottles. And then shots to celebrate Vince's 30th. Hey, congrats, sir! I'm in no matter what, dude, seriously. No matter. I still love you, Vince. No matter. Vince! Where you going? Lena. Do you want some champagne? Um, I should really get back to my friends, but entertaining conversation. Uh, speaking of entertainment. Um, uh... Do you like stage plays? Only if it's Shakespeare. That's perfect, because he's like my favorite and the Gillioz is putting on Romeo and Juliet in the next couple of months and I've got tickets. Cool. So, what are you doing Friday night? Dinner and a movie, with me. Lena's my girl. I don't see a ring. Come on. Easy, easy, easy. Devon! Devon! Hey, hey, Devon, he's drunk, man. Chill out. You good? You good? I'm good. Stay away from my girl. Babe, let's go. What's wrong with you? Is, is she gonna be okay? Hey, he wasn't drunk, was he? Is he drunk? Will you go check on her? You okay? Hey. Vince. Hey! Vince! Hey, Vincent. Valentina? Hey. I haven't seen you since, uh. Our last date. Where you broke up with me. I go away for two years and. I mean, come on, Vince. I called you probably 100 times. And I left you messages. I never forgot about you. I'm really sad you left, actually. Where'd you go? Away. I think I'm in love with you. Is this what you call love, Vince? So this is what you call love? I'll show you what love is. Okay. That's fast. Then, can we talk? Really? Why would I wanna talk? So that's all I am to you? Just a body. No, babe. An object? You're more than that, you're... I can't believe that's what you were thinking about the entire time we were dating, wasn't it? Please, don't pout to me, okay. Pouting, maybe that's why I didn't return your calls, you know? I guess the only real pleasure I got from you was our kiss and you refused to go to the next level then, the same as you are now. The next level? You're the one that cheated on me, remember? So why did you even come here tonight? Happy birthday, Vince. Come on, don't look at me like that, sis. It can wait. Don't answer it. What's up, Vince? Hey, Stephen, Lily. Look, I didn't mean to make a scene at your wedding. But the fact is I did and I'm sorry. You deserved a perfect day and I messed that up. Anyway, I think you're a wonderful couple and I wish you the best. And a hearty congratulations. Well, thank you, Vince. It means a lot. Hey, and stay away from my sis... I would tell you, happy birthday, but it's come and gone. I waited six hours, Vincent because you promised you would be here at 8:00 and we would celebrate by going through your photo albums. Yeah, well the wedding went a little long, so. And that makes it okay to not keep your word? And how am I supposed to feel when you're out late at night when the cartel is causing havoc in the city? Save your drama for your llama, momma. Have you ever talked to a llama? Hey Mr. Llama, my son won't keep his word. What should I do? Really? That's funny. Llama, your breath stinks. No matter what good advice you get, there's Vince. Hey Mom. Don't give your drama to your momma, Llama. I should have been here. I should have been there. I just want peace, you know. Hey. Hey. I know you miss her. We all do. Just remember the importance of a promise, okay? Okay. Goodnight, Momma. God bless you, Llama. Manuelo, more two by fours, man, I'm not... - Woo - hoo! Donuts! Donuts! Go nuts for donuts! Go nuts for donuts! Come on in and get some, boys. Dude, I love it when you're late. Best job site rule ever. Vincent! Oo! Watch this. Hey, what's up, Roxanne? You foxy lady, you want some donuts, hm? They're fresh. 15 late days this month. And why was today so special? I have more important things to do than worry about if nincompoops like you are gonna show up on time! You are... fired. You can have the box. Help D'Qwell in the master with the walls. Roger that, babe. I'm not your babe. Thank you, Manny. And you're not a charming prince, Vince. Ha, whatever you say, Foxy Roxy. All right. Yo, yo, yo, what's up, D'Qwell? You ready to get stuff done? Okay. Laurel's dog take a dookie in your oatmeal? You know what? We're gonna talk about this. You go on dates, kiss the girls, you have your little one night stands, but you ain't loved a single one of them, have you? Come on, man. You know as well as I do, the chics, they like being snuggled, you know. That's not why you do it, you self-centered ho. Why'd you have to make a move on Lena, man? You know why you did it? Because you lust and you call it love and you see her, she's young, she's pretty and you just wanna use her young body for your pleasure, is that it? Right, that mindset is what turns good men into rapists and molesters. Is that what you want, Vince? No. I didn't think that's what I was doing. Yeah, well, you don't think. Before you claim to love someone, you need to find out what love is. Grow up. Vince. What's up, Ben? Have you seen the movie "Twilight?" Nope. All right, so there's this vampire guy, right? This skinny vampire guy who's totally into this chic. She's all like, oo, I'm not sure. And the vampire guy is like, I'm sure. She's like, okay. And so then they start making out, right? Mwah, mwah, mwah. And then werewolf guy shows up and he's all like, bro, I'm totally gonna steal your girl. Okay, Ben, Ben, just save the backstory. Give me the punchline. Take martial arts with me. There are private lessons, right? I mean they're technically not legal. I mean, she's got some unorthodox methods. Whoa, whoa, she? Not legal? Yeah man, sign me up. Dude, Devon is gonna come after you. Dude, Ben, Devon has nothing to worry about. Is this the same Devon that we're talking about? Whenever a guy's tried to steal his girlfriend, he turns into, Hulk smash! He's not gonna let you forget about this. And Alicia can turn skinny vampire Vince into a slippery, lethal weapon. You would actually stand a chance against werewolf dude. What? I didn't say anything. Okay Ben, look. I'm never going to take martial arts from a woman. So, why are you here, handsome? You know, I'm just here to learn how to take down Goliath and win your heart, thou fair Juliet. Shut up. This class is not for faint hearted Romeo. Or is it David? I'm confused. This class requires more than just your pretty face. It requires commitment. Well, he is committed, Alicia. Yeah. He's got something to fight for. Yeah? I do, so quit it. No, you are selfish. But, you pay me good money. And you're gorgeous. So... let's begin. - Whoa, whoa, Alice. - Alicia. Whatever, kind of hot chic. Look, I don't wanna hit girls. You already hit on me. What, no? I was just. Ha, you did, kinda. Okay, sorta. Look, point is, I don't want to hurt you. Ah! You think he needs CPR? Because I could totally use the practice. Hey, buddy. You're taking this vampire look way too seriously. What? You say you want to fight off Goliath. David's downfall was Bath-sheba. Ha, Owwww. To listen to your message press, first message. Hey Vince, it's D'Qwell. Sorry I was a little rough on you yesterday. You know, I'm serious about what I said, man. I love ya, I'm just looking out for you. And if you're ready to learn what love is, come meet me at the church. All right, brother. Hope to hear from you soon. Hey, hey, brother, brother. Hey, can you spare me a couple bucks here? Sorry, man, I gotta go. Why marriage, hm? Why start a family? We all know divorces are increasing, right? Divorce rates have actually gone down because fewer and fewer couples are actually getting married. So many people are convinced that marriage will eventually end in divorce, they won't vow in marriage at all. I mean and with... Devon? All the good advice on social media. - Bath - sheba. And the internet, can you blame 'em? I mean, if we spent as much time investing in loving someone rather than seeking to be loved, man, our relationships would thrive. How many of you have divorced parents? People fall in love and they get married but 10 years and two kids down the road, they somehow fall out of love? Real love is not blind; it's all seeing. It sees all of the faults. It sees your bad habits; the imperfections. It loves anyway. Infatuation... is blind... and fragile. When things aren't going perfect, it disappears. Or when tragedy strikes. It vanishes. Well, she'd still be alive if hadn't given her everything she wanted! She was just a kid! You forced her into the grave, Leon, because you forced her to do everything else! I am done with you! Get out! Ha! Well it amazes me how easy it is to walk away. I thought I loved you once. Perhaps I never did. Get out! Most of the time, when tragedy strikes a family... a divorce follows. Those life changing events, they can serve... to either destroy a marriage or strengthen one. Vince, Vince. Vince, come on, man. It's Evangeline, isn't it? She was my everything. My rock, my conscience. And now she's gone. So you just thought baby faced Lena could some how mask your pain? I guess. You know her dad died? Sister just got married. Just imagine how she feels living alone in that apartment just trying to make end's meet. Baby, baby. Look, I can't have what you guys have, okay? This perfect little family. Why not? Because I can't protect them. I couldn't protect Evangeline. Stop it, Evangeline loves you. She is looking down on heaven trying to help you, brother. This thing with Lena, I need you to just view her like a sister, okay? Build a... a foundation of friendship. Wait, what? What about Devon? What? He sees you two hanging out, he is not gonna call it friendship. Ugh. Listen to me, okay. Every society fails when their protectors become predators. You don't need to try to find someone, you need to try to be someone. Be a protector, brother. And then they'll find you. Be a brother before a lover, not the other way around. All right? All right, man. All right. Hey. Be good, love ya, brother. Love you too, man. You know, it's company policy not to give customers this kind of attention. Well then that's why I'm not one, today. Thank you, this is so sweet. But um, I really need to keep this job. Okay, I guess I'll see you Friday night. Are you stalking me? Stocking? Are you prepping for Christmas? Company policy says I have to be nice to customers but I think management might agree, you're an exception. Um, in that case I think I'll have... What are you doing here, Vincent? I'm hungry. For food or punishment? Forgiveness. We don't serve that here. Well, I guess I'll just have your... you know what, surprise me. Coming right up. Thank you. Careful, the plate is hot with displeasure. Wow, what a surprise. It's what you ordered! Hey Lena, wait. Look. I am so sorry about the other night. It may have been the drinking, I don't know. What I do know is that you're a hustler. You've got these two jobs you're working with classes in between. And with Lily getting married and moving away, I know it's gotta be hard to pay rent. I just wanna help ya out with things in life, you know. What do you know about my life? I know what it's like to lose somebody. I'd like to be there for ya, you know? Kind of like a brother you never had. A brother. Yeah, okay, uh. Goodnight. Uh, I'll serve you now. You just did. He seems like a keeper. What a dead beat, what are you thinking? Maybe forgiveness is on the menu. Prosecutor. Detective. You're late. Working on the cartel case. It's getting worse. Two more homicides last week. Catch them and I'll see they get life. The issue I'm having is they're well armed, well organized, and they're getting recruits. You have an entire police force at your disposal, Mr. Clark. What's taking you? Bringing me one name is not enough. Everyone I've interrogated refuses to give up the leader. I don't want pawns, Mrs. Draper, I want the king. And no one will go up against him for fear of getting killed. That includes you. So, how does this work? You first. - I'm going first? - Yup. Don't threaten me with a good time. Is it from me? Oo. Well, since you're mommy's pampered little girl. Oh right? And since you never got over your princess phase, I actually thought you might like this. Maybe you could use it for balls or dances. Maybe Scott asks you to Ho-Co or prom. I hope he never does. Ha, oh. Oh my. Vince, I love it. Let me get this outta your way. It's beautiful. Just like you. Thank you. Aww. You're welcome. Love you. - Love you too. - Thanks. Oh, and there actually is a dance coming up. What? And I will wear this on one condition. Oh? That you come as my dance partner. As thou hast wished, my lady. Thank you. No peeking. Okay. And... Whoa! What? No way, there's no way you can afford that. - You guys did this, huh? - No! You guys did this. No, no, it was all her. I knew you wanted to learn so I saved up. Oh my gosh, you're such a sweetheart, thank you so much. I'm speechless. Okay, I'll learn it on one condition. Here we go. And what is that? You help me write a song. Okay, as thou hast wished, M'sieur Weirdo. One about us? Deal. Okay. Boom. How would you define love? Love isn't something you control, Vince. For me and Lily, it just happened. Still feel that way after the honeymoon? It means to plant trees under whose shade you don't expect to sit. Love is taking care of the poor! Why the sudden interest in love? Got a girl on your mind? Eh, maybe. Mostly I'm just curious as to why people would have pets for their family. I don't get that. Why not just have spouse and kids? Why do you have to have a whiny little pup? Well, why not? I mean pets are cute and they don't talk back to their parents. Oh, except for my pet llama. Look at this. Love, the total commitment to the spiritual growth of another person. - Here you go. - Hey, Lil. D'Qwell, man, DQ dude, I don't know what trap you got me in. I've been studying and studying and studying and I cannot find an answer to the love question. All I find is more questions. I've always had feelings for people but I've been asking myself, is love a feeling? And when you lose that feeling, how do you love when you don't love? Love is a verb. Love the feeling is a fruit of love, the verb. Wait! That's kind of interesting. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her; empathize; appreciate. Affirm her. Vince, you coming to my birthday party? Well heaven's yeah, babe. What do you want for it, big Kyson? A football and to blast fireworks. - Oo, that sounds fun. - Wait, what? Hey man, I'll blast some for ya. You'll be here, huh? Like the last two years. Don't you disappoint my son again. I'll be here. Scout's honor, man. - Mm - hm. - Mm - hm. - Mm - hm. Oh yeah, Mommy might give me a baby sister. Hey come here, come here. Can you do me a favor, buddy? Heaven's yeah, babe. Your sister, she's going to be like the most important person in your life. Always treat her like a princess, okay? Can you do that for me? Scout's honor. That's my boy. So baby, when's dinner ready? It's in the microwave. Pot roast? Microwave? That pregnancy got you acting crazy. Don't be criticizing your wife's choices. You're one of 'em. - Oh, ho, ho! - Roasted. Okay, well what is a queen without her king? Historically? More powerful. Oof! You went low! - You went. - I went to the gut. - You know what? - I went to gut. - It's go time! - I went to gut. It's go time! So I wanted to ask you guys, what's the greatest love story of all time? Easy. Romeo and Juliet. Wow, really Ben? Even Shakespeare said that was a tragedy. Okay. They were so in love they couldn't carry on in life without each other. Exactly. You mean to tell me it would be love that prompts you to kill yourself if your wife died? No, having one would. Love goes beyond a husband and wife relationship. Agreed. When Kyson was born, I felt a love greater than I've ever felt in my entire life, okay. That's a love that Romeo and Juliet denied themselves. Mm, I felt the same way when my daughter was born. You? You have a daughter? You have a brain? Is she hot? No, you can't date my daughter. What? Come on! I take it you spent a lot of time trying to find your daughter? How long has it been? Years. Look, Vince. We've all lost somebody at some point. Whether through death or... someone moves far away. But when two people truly love each other, they always find a way to connect. No matter what. Did you hear on the news that there's a drug cartel around here? Who's ready for some chocolate cake? Oo, I love chocolate cake. You don't love chocolate cake. And you know what I love? I'm just saying, I mean what have you ever done for chocolate cake? Do you call up chocolate cake? Do you wanna help chocolate cake reach its goals? Surprise chocolate cake at work? Do you wanna marry chocolate cake and make nice little swirly, vanilla chocolate baby cupcakes? D'Qwell! Do not give me a sermon on love. I'm just saying, there's a difference between loving chocolate cake and just desiring chocolate cake. I think love is like a ghost. Because like, everybody talks about it, but do we ever see one? Just saying. Nice. Keep your guard up. Hyah! Oh, that's a death sentence. That's six feet under, dude. Ugh! Oof! Ah! Oh, oh. Ah! I hear you've been breaking hearts and chasing young girls. Which means either you don't care or you know nothing about love. If it's real it costs; it hurts. I broke the closest thing to your heart. And every time you hurt another girl, I'll break something else of yours. I understand if you no longer wish to continue our working relationship. Do you want to continue on this journey with me? Heaven's yeah, babe. I love it when you call me that. Ah, ah, ow! Ow. Okay. I need my dad. Well done. You were right, Ben. He is committed. - Mm - hm. Is he single? So, do I only get visits when you break a bone, son? I brought you a gift. That shouldn't be in here. How's your mother? Oh, the bank wants to take her house. Really? She didn't say anything to me. But then again, she hasn't for years. So. How'd ya break it? Oh, learning about love. Anything stick this time? Oh, that it's extremely painful. It makes your heart race. - Mm - hm. Well, judging by your heart rate, what's broken is behind your ribs. Lift your shirt, please. Maybe you're looking for love in the wrong place. Where else could I look? Oh, come on, Dad. What? I didn't say anything. Look, why can't I just come over and we have a beer and talk? I really do appreciate the offer. I know that you blame it for the divorce but there's nothing wrong with having a beer or two. And there's nothing wrong with letting him into your heart. You know what, I don't need this. I made a mistake coming here. What's her name? As I have opened this beer at your suggestion, I hope you will open your heart to Him at mine. Glad I'm a private doctor. I just want peace, you know. I guess the only thing I've really learned about love so far is it's extremely painful. Pain. The one thing we spend our whole life trying to avoid, while expecting to grow. You walked out on Mom, Dad. You don't really have a lot of room to talk. I've made some of the biggest mistakes, yes. But I've also learned some of the biggest lessons, son. But you messed up, so you hurt. Why does it hurt me to actually attempt to love somebody? True love never hurts anyone. Longing hurts. Selfishness, jealousy... They cause pain. And Love... Love gets blamed for it. Selfishness says, "what can you do for me?" But Love asks, "what can I do for you?" It's like casting love out and making a splash. Slowly... Love ripples back to you. Pretty good speech. Ha. You couldn't be more religious. More scientific, then? Sure. Take your science. Prove me wrong. But son, studying about love will only take you so far. Excuse me. And don't forget your prescription. Drugs? "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none." Shakespeare. Your hero, Shakespeare. And if it doesn't work? Increase the dose. Another murder in the city. The body was discovered earlier today in the downtown area. Detective Alfred Clark says, preliminary evidence points to the cartel in this latest killing. According to authorities, hate crimes have risen dramatically. Up 12% this year. The more chaotic people get, the bigger government has to be to maintain law and order... The American people are only a threat to the idea of big government. It's called checks and balances and clearly you've never heard of that. As a politician my only interest is the American people. I represent the American people... Then why don't you listen to them? Why do you keep interrupting me? Love never lasts. Mom? To my daughter, Lieserl Einstein. When I proposed the theory of relativity, very few understood me and what I reveal now to transmit to mankind will also collide with the misunderstanding and prejudice in the world. There is an extremely powerful force, that, so far science has not found a formal explanation to. It is a force that includes and... governs all, and is even behind any phenomenon operating in the universe. And has not yet been defined by us. This universal force... is Love. Love is light, that enlightens those who give and receive it. Love is gravity, because it makes some people feel attracted to others. Love is power, because it multiplies the best we have and allows humanity not to be extinguished in selfishness. Love unfolds and reveals. For love we live and die. God is Love and Love is God. Love is the most powerful force there is because it has no limits. Each individual carries within them a small, but powerful generator of love whose energy is waiting to be released. Do you have an apartment I can rent until Spring? Who do I write it to? Grant Enterprises. My dear Lieserl. Maybe it's too late to apologize. But as time is relative, I need to tell you, "I love you. And thanks to you I have reached the ultimate answer." Mr. Abrams, two by four, 27 and a half. Don't you dare laugh. I've gotta roll, man. Family stuff, huh? Yeah. I didn't know you had family. New tattoo? Vince. You should just worry about you little love story stuff, okay? What is the greatest love story of all time? Can I get her anything she wants on your dime? Yeah, that's what we kinda had planned, so. I'll start with coffee. To answer your question, parental love or romantic love is the neurochemical reward for cooperation. Forget about the myth of "love at first sight". If it's a feeling that's only stimulated by sight it can only be lust. It's the day to day experiences. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy with that thing, man. Whoa, whoa, yerself! I ain't aiming it at you. Actually, you are. I'm here to make Vincent Lovell pay for his sins. I think we might be able to help each other. How do you know him? Thank you, sir. I just can't do it today. Uh, Paul? We needed this at 27 and a half, please. It's gonna have to wait, we'll have to reschedule. Paul? Lily, will you please let me talk? I can't just leave whenever I want. Roxanne has us working overtime, all right? I know we were supposed to go out and I'm sorry. But it's gonna have to be rescheduled. Commercial and Boonville? Okay, what time? Right now! You go shopping all the time, buy all the stuff you don't even need. Come on, you know what. Ah! No, no, I'm fine. You know what, I gotta go. You have left early quite a bit the last few weeks. I'll be back to full-time soon, I promise. Ugh, okay, be gone nincompoop. Thanks, boss. What is it, Vince? Vince, what is it? - Hey. - Yeah. Uh, the extension cord has got a short in it. Yeah. I could fix it, but I'd rather just buy it from you. Ha. Two boxes of donuts. Great. Consider this your down payment, Babe. Thank you, Foxy Roxy. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Hey Momma. Hey Llama. So, are you ready to tell me what's been bothering you? I'm your mother and I know when something's wrong and it's not a broken rib. So. What has you so stressed out that over the past three years you've aged 10? Whatever the case, I don't wanna age as fast as you. And I don't know what to do about the bank wanting to take the house. Well, I've been saving up for a house of my own, but. I've got a little bit in savings. I'll get it. I just wanted to say sorry for my melt down at Stephen's wedding. And as a gesture of friendship, there's a small town north of here with a sweet lake and a bunch of cabins. I booked one. I just wanted to personally give you an invite. So, are you coming? Dude, there is no way I am going. Hey this is Devon, leave a message. Hey Devon. Showed up to this sweet cabin you were talking about. I don't see anybody here. Wondering where you guys are at. Anyway, give me a call. This here feller's the culprit? That's him all right. Name's Amos, and I don't like meeting this way but your actions gave me no other choice. Oh boy, it's gonna be so good to finally see her get hitched. Okay guys, just lower the guns and let's have a nice little talk. Amos who? What are you talking about? Purvis, how come this feller ain't got the foggiest notion of what we're saying? It's him, Pa. Two years ago I seen him dating our sister. Okay, let's get something straight. Dating your sister is something I would never do. - Hey! - Oh, kay. She may not be as purdy as me, but she sure ain't ugly. Purvis. Your sister said the culprit looked like a bloated cow. This feller looks like a starving... Don't say it, don't say it. Llama. Pa, when we was in Springfield two years ago, I seen the two of them cozy in a blanket. And they kissed. Son, I'm grateful that you're sheltered but not that you're dumb. Come to think of it, I don't remember your sister talking to me about no marriage. Did you even tell her this feller was comin'? Get your chores done and clean up. Come with me, young feller. Let me tell ya a story. About 20 years ago, a man come into town, with a baby. About her age. The man died when she turned six. She didn't have a ma. So, we took her in. As she grew, she got all determined that her ma was still alive and that she was gonna find her, in Springfield. She went there to look for her. One trip she come back all twitterpated. Next trip... pregnant. A rapist. It's a problem in our world I'd like to see us get fixed, but we never found the rapist. She kept the baby, of course. Her father's name was Mr. Valentine. So she took his name as her own with a little bit of a feminine twist. She's faithful. She believes God will bring her back to her ma. She's going to Springfield next Friday. Do some more looking. Hey, young fella... Are you all right? Hey! Hey, we ain't done! This ain't over yet! What do you wanna do in the future? Honestly, I just wanna find my mom. Honestly, I'd like to help you. Um, Vince? Yeah? There's something I... I gotta tell you. Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay, hey. You can tell me anything, it's all right. Valentina, I love you, okay. Nothing's gonna change that. I'm. I'm pregnant. It's not what you think, okay. What? Will you just, just let me explain the situation and what happened? Because it's a lot. You cheated on me? No, I wouldn't cheat on you! I love you. You know that. - What are you doing? - You know what, No, I can't. I can't do this. I, I... You can't do what? I'm sorry, I can't. Vince! Vince, come back! VINCE! Love is commitment. It's friendship. It's service. It's sacrifice. You did... So, I will. Vincent? I rarely see you write. Wedding vows. You have a fiance? A girlfriend? Then who are you writing vows to? My future. Anyone? What if she's not pretty? I guess I'll serve her 'til she's pretty to me. And if she cheats on you? I won't let other's choices tell me how to feel. Who I love and when I love them is not up to them. It's my choice. So whoever I give this letter to, if she accepts... I will be committed to forever. No matter. Oh. What happened to my llama? Come here. Oh. Oooow! Nice. You're okay, push through the pain. Okay, yeah, I got this. Hyght! Hyght! Kamai hamai haaa! That's it. Hey, that rib's looking better. Are you going to the dance? With smooth moves like that, you should go. Hey, take Alicia. She's not a heart breaker. Yeah, it's not really my heart I'm worried about. I actually like that a lot better going from D to A. Okay. I say we lock it. Yeah, me too. Okay, cool. We wrote a song, yes! Hooray for us. Okay, so Vince? What's up? Can you promise me something? I can. What's up? If one of us dies... Don't you talk like that. What, I... Why would you ever say something like that? I'm just saying that we can't control everything so just hear me out, okay? Weirdo. Mom and Dad have always been super cool to us. So I think that we should make a promise that one of us will always be here for them. Commercial and Boonville? Okay, what time? Hello? I'm just passing through. You know what to do. No, don't, please, please. Meddle in our business again... I won't come back. And I'll kill you. And since the new guy seems to know you, you locate us again, and I will kill him. Where's Lily? Um, I don't know. Over there! Ya, that's what I'm talking about, man. Hey, Stephen. No Lily? We separated. What? It wasn't all Lily's fault. I made mistakes too. The first thing he says to me is, you've been home all day, why isn't the house clean? Oh, no. I would have said, "you've been at work all day why aren't we rich?" We both needed love from each other, but we weren't willing to give it. Happy wife, happy life. I don't know, I think it has to go both ways. Happy spouse, happy house. I mean we can't expect to be pampered without giving a little bit in return. The lights, the music, the drinks, all of it. We were so focused on the event that we paid no attention to the vow. Weddings, they happen all the time, man. Marriages happen too little. And regardless of his mood swings, you need to find a way to be happy without depending on him. - Yes. - Yeah. - Mm - hm. My dad always said that a marriage was a reunion of two forgivers. You know what might make you feel better? Let's go dance! Hey. Hey. How's Lena? Good. No Devon? Devon went out to get some real drinks. So I got to spend some time with Lily, which was good. Because she's been going through a rough time. Yeah. But enough about my sister. How are you holding up? Okay, you ready? I'm ready. All right. One, two. No, Vince! What, here? You end up right here, yeah. For real? Yes, for real. Okay, look when I said that I would be your dance partner I didn't say I wanted to practice 'til the wee hours of the night. I think that you should always be learning, Vince. And I mean, maybe some day, somewhere you will use these moves. These moves? Yeah, these moves. Okay. Now are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. And don't mess it up this time. Whatever you say. Okay, feel the rhythm. One, two, three. Who knows, maybe the day will come when I can dance with her again. She taught me all kinds of dips and lifts and spins. What? Yeah, she was good. I've always wanted a brother to teach me how to dance. Want to show me some moves? Me? Yeah. Uh... It's fine, it's fine. We'll catch Devon up when he gets here. Sure. It's really quite simple. Make sure your feet are staggered. Hand goes here so you can feel which way I'm going. We put our hands together and you just follow my lead, okay? And one, two, three. Sorry about your dress. There we go. Hey babe, Vince is gonna teach us some dance moves. Oh he is? Yeah, let's dance. Can I talk to you outside for a minute? Yeah! I'm about to bring it! We'll only be a moment, Lena. That was a pretty interesting stunt you pulled back there, Devon. Trying to force me into some kind of shotgun wedding. Ha, I just wanna know why. To protect Lena from snakes! I told you to stay away! Devon, we can talk about this. There's only one language you get! Ow!! Stay away from Lena! Devon! Devon, stop! Stop, this isn't you! Vince apologized and he's my friend. Why are you doing this? Vincent? Are you okay? I'll send somebody to help you, I promise. Ow. It's gonna be okay. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I don't need to know how it happened. I just need to know that it'll stop. No activities, son. I'm sure you'll be fine walking, maybe jogging. But nothing else. Dad? Is Evangeline alive? I believe so. Her spirit. I have felt her a few times since she passed. Heard stories about angels. Ancestors. Even unborn children coming to help or comfort loved ones during hard times. I think God sends the ones who love us the most to be with us during those times. Devon? Purvis. We need to do something about Vince. I'll pay any price to get him outta my life and away from my girl. Well, he did date my sister around the time she got pregnant. What are you saying? What I'm saying is, he got me ticked off. And for the right price, I'll stand witness against him. For what? Who did this to you? Mom, it's okay. No, I'll make sure the police get this guy. The good book says "love your enemies, do good to those that hate you, pray for those who despite-fully use you." It's no big deal, I'm fine. Good evening, ma'am. May I help you? My name's Detective Alfred Clark. I'm with the Springfield Police Department. I have a few questions I need to ask your son. May we come in? Yeah, come on in. He can describe the man who assaulted him. Actually, I have a warrant for his arrest. What? No, wait a minute. He's the victim! Ma'am, I will warn you, I don't have a whole lot of time so if you make any kind of trouble you'll be looking at an arrest of your own. Yeah, well then take me! Mom, stop. It's okay, it's okay. What are the charges? Vincent Lovell, you're under arrest under suspicion of rape. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Arresting criminals is one thing. Convincing the judge to convict them is another. That's why witnesses are so important. For example, there's a man, if you wanna call him a man, Vincent Lovell, who was recently arrested for rape. He is soon to be yet another conviction on my ledger. And that man is going away. He's going to be locked up for a long time and if I have my way, he's going to be locked up for life. Because it is important for the citizens of this city and of this county that men like this, ugh... sorry Creeps like this... are taken off our streets. Lovell, get up. For everyone's safety. You made bail. Get up! Time to go. I don't know why they're letting ya out. I'm just gonna see you right after the trial. It's important to get these criminals off our streets for the safety of the citizens of Springfield and all of Greene County. She couldn't wait until after the trial. What is it with society wanting to paint people as criminals without any proof. Despite my protests, your friendly neighborhood prosecutor pushed for the judge to have this installed. Most of my career, you had to have a witness to the victim to be able to arrest and monitor an alleged criminal. Now it's just guilty until proven innocent. Look, you've been calm through this and cooperative. Which is rare. Look, with all the hate out there, I'd rather be focusing on the cartel case. That ankle monitor is run by GPS. You have to be at the address that's on your file by 8:00 P.M. every night. You stay out of trouble until the trial, all this clears up. But listen, if you don't follow protocol, I'm gonna have to arrest you again. And it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna go to prison for a very, very, uncomfortably long time. See ya after the trial. Go on. Could you use some breakfast? I don't have an appetite, Dad, thanks. Please tell me it's not true. It's not. Did you help the lady down the street like I asked? Yes! Why didn't ever tell me about that. Okay, I'm sorry. How many more times are you gonna actually make me apologize? Sorry is just not gonna cut it. Look, I'm taking classes to fix this. I'm taking AA, I'm taking anger management... And you're still not listening! - But... - NO! I told you Vincent was just my friend! Okay. The truth is, I messed up. But I will do anything for you. You were there for me through everything. Now I'm gonna be there for you. Okay, that's enough apologizing for one day. Yeah? Dealing drugs is a slippery slope, man. You gotta find a way out. There's only one way out. Then we find another. You don't wanna be remembered as a drug dealer. Really? You gonna put a label on me? The only label I'd have for you is "friend". Well, at least I'm not a "rapist". I don't know if you're there, God. Whoever you are. But if You're there. There's a lot of people out here that could use Your help. I know it's difficult to work but I won't let it stop me to get things done. And I just spent all my savings. You're fired. I brought you some donuts. No, Vincent. You are fired. And don't call me babe, or Foxy Roxy. Whatever you say. Mrs. Valentine. What? Your husband, Mr. Valentine. Took your daughter when she was two. Somehow thought you'd never look in a small town north of here. He never told her what your name was, where you lived. Who you were. And then he died. And the local neighbors, they didn't know who you were. So how could she? I know why you're firing me, Roxanne. Because apparently, I'm a rapist. You wanna know who the victim is? Your daughter. And she's in town today. Where!? Where is she? I burned that bridge, too. Ladies and gentlemen, the happy couple. Congratulations. Congrats. Let me see the ring, let me see it. Hey, you don't need that. It's beautiful! Ha, okay! Bye. Okay, walk us through it. Okay, so. Chaaaadd! I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you. Thank you. Mike, my man. It's good to see you. Uncle Ron! Hey! You gone and done and done it. Here we go, down the hatch, my friends. - Down the hatch. - Down the hatch. Here we go, here's to the... No, no, no, no. No, that's not good. Thanks for coming. Come on in. Vince, what is this all about? I have nothing to say to him. I killed Evangeline. The two of you were actually gone on a date that night. I got home from my own date where I broke up with my girlfriend. Vince, come back! Evangeline! We're late for the party, let's go. Scott? Yeah, I know, I know. She's coming. I know dude, I know. Vince, I'm so glad you're here. Can you please tell Scott that I'm not going with him? Why? He's drunk. Look, I love you, kiddo, but if I go tell him, he's just gonna be persistent. Okay, maybe you should tell him. Vince, he'll think that I don't like him. If he's gonna know that you don't wanna go you should be the one that tells him. Look, right now I don't have the strength. I need you. You know, Valentina told me that same thing. Vince, I need you. No, Ang, what you need is a brain. Maybe then, you'd pick a decent boyfriend. Okay, he's probably cheating on you anyway. It's the going thing these days. Vince. Love never lasts. So this is what you call love? I don't know anymore. Babe! Let's go! Yeah well maybe you should figure that out. You know, I still love you Vince... no matter. That was the last thing she said to me. I could have stopped her. Instead... I killed her. And, my actions... led to your divorce. I tried to mask my pain and my guilt. Going to parties and drinking alcohol and hanging with loose women. I'm sorry, Mom. Dad. Son, when your greatest of mistakes become your greatest ministry, Grace has come full circle. Let Him in. Vincent, I know that you can't see me but I hope that you can feel that I'm here. Vincent. Vincent, what are you doing? Vince, no. Put, put the gun down. Put the gun down. Vincent, this is not the answer. It's not your time! Vincent! Please! Help him know that he is loved. Lord, help Vince feel Your presence. Vincent, no, think about Mom! Vincent, think about Dad! YOU PROMISED! Ang? Evangeline? Is that you? Yes, Vince, I'm here. I've always been here. Do it. What? I didn't say anything. Do it. What is the greatest love story of all time? Love never lasts. God is love and love is God. Keep it. Vince, you coming to my birthday party? Scout's honor. You'll be here, huh? It's an action, man. Selfishness says, "what can you do for me?" Love asks, "what can I do for you?" That ankle monitor's run by GPS. You have to be at the address that's on your file by 8:00 P.M. every night. If you don't follow protocol, I'm gonna have to arrest you again. And it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna go to prison for a very, uncomfortably long time. It's no use. I mean, if we spend as much time investing in loving someone rather than seeking to be loved, man, our relationships would thrive. If it's real, it costs; it hurts. Meddle in our business again and I'll kill ya. There's only one way out. And since the new guy seems to know you, you locate us again and I will kill him. December 20th. Love is commitment... it's friendship. She's going to Springfield next Friday. It's service. Where? It's sacrifice. You did... so I will. Vincent, what are you doing? Vincent! Vincent, where are you going? VINCENT! Uh, detective. There's a blip on my screen. It's Mr. Lovell, he's probably leaving the state. I'm on it. Keep me posted on where he goes. All right, call me if you need backup. Olivia? Leon. I think Vince was trying to say goodbye. Hey, it's D'Qwell. I'm probably playing... Everybody, time for cake! Yay! I don't like footballs. That looks amazing. What the? Not good, not good, not good! Is Vince coming? Son. Sometimes people aren't who you think they are. He's on Fremont and St. Louis Street. I don't see him anywhere. Oh, that's his car all right. There's something wrong with my service, stay on the line. Okay. Where are you, son? D'Qwell come on. Come on, pick up. Pick up, man! Hey, it's D'Qwell. I'm probably playing with my kid and doing stuff my wife told me to do. What do I do? They will kill me. What's right? All right everybody, it's time to go inside! - Aw! - What!? Come on! I guess he's not coming. See ya later, man. See ya later. God, if you're even there. I could sure use your help right now. Can you give me something? Could you give me a sign? Fireworks! Whoa. Fireworks! Kyson! Go long! Heavens yeah, babe! Baby, you're right. Sometimes people aren't who we think they are. Where is he now? Right now he's headed west on Traffic Way. No. He's not here. Olivia, maybe you should just stay there in case he comes back. I'll go ahead and check downtown. I don't know, just keep looking. How's your mother? Bank wants to take her house. Really? I mean, I've been saving up for a house of my own, but I got a little bit in savings. Got him in my sights. He dropped something. I'm following him. I don't think he's leaving the state. Boss. No. Come on. There is no way out. And there will be no fence sitters ON MY CREW! Shots fired, I repeat, shots fired. VINCENT! Ah! I know you don't want to do this either, Brick. I want this one. - Stop! - Ah! Ugh! Uh, detective. We lost connection. What? Give me his last location. Brick. You have no idea what you're up against. In my business. No one messes with the cartel. We'll kill you. Dance with me. Trust me. Hurry up. Easy does it. Easy does it. You all right? Huh? Vince, how'd you do that? My sister taught me. Listen, Vince. Save it, Paul. Vince, I have a son. Henry, he's four years old. I didn't even know he existed 'til a month ago and now I have to take care of him. And framing wasn't cutting it. I know I shouldn't have got in so deep with these guys but I didn't have a choice! Hey, hey, hey! Here's your chance to get out, okay. You can either selfishly run, or you can show some love for your city and tell the detective who's on his way everything you know. Is there really a detective coming? Park Central Square. Guy's we gotta get outta here. The choice is yours. Vince. Babe, how much have you had? Oh, just a couple. I'll be fine, don't worry about it. You ready to go? Sure. I think we should check Park Central Square. Well how do you know he's there? Just a feeling. Romeo? Romeo? Wherefore art thou, Romeo? Goodnight, a thousand times. Goodnight a thousand, thousand times, fair Romeo. There's no way I'm letting you drive. I'm gonna drive, okay. No, you're not. Yeah? Get the keys from me then. Vincent? Yeah, keep on stepping, skinny! Come on, babe. Babe, come on. Babe! I wanna drive. No, why? What are you stopping for, let's go, come on. So this is what you call love? The point still stands. I just want us to be safe. We'll be fine, okay. We will be fine. Babe, let's go! My dad lost his legs because my mom... The problem is that you're drunk and I don't want you to drive the car! It means to plant trees under whose shade you don't expect to sit. Love is a verb. The most powerful force, because it has no limit. Stay away from Lena! The total commitment to the spiritual growth of another person. Love the feeling. Increase the dose. A divorce follows. I told you to stay away! Let Him in. Devon! She doesn't want to go. I told you to stay out of my business. Who I choose to care for is not your business. Lena, do you wanna go with him? Yeah, but I wanna drive, Devon. Are you gonna keep ignoring your fiance? Devon! Devon! Mom, it's his battle. Dad, wait. Stay down, final warning! Devon, stop. Excuse me? I won't let another sister die. Look, I don't know what you've dealt with in your life. I don't know what baggage you have. But whatever it is, let it out. Let it out now, let it out on me. Because if you lay ONE FINGER! on her at any point in your life, I'll see to it that you never see her again. Every society fails when its protectors become its predators. Learn what love is before claiming to love Lena. I'm sorry, Vince. Hurry. Vincent! He'll be back. Dear Juliet. Why are thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous? And that the lean, abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that, I will stay with thee. And never from this palace of dim night depart again. Here, here will I remain. With worms that are thy chambermaids. Here will I setup my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars! Arms take your last embrace. And lips, O you. The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss. A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct. Come unsavory guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! Here's to my love. O, true apothecary. Thy drugs are quick. Does he feel guilt? Pain? Abandonment? He doesn't die for her but just to escape his own pain. And is that love? Or is it to still live and to carry on her memory? Love isn't something that you find. It's something that you choose. And when you choose it, love will find you. Front and center. Vincent? Your mom's name is Roxanne Stilwell. What? And she's looking for you. Valentina, I apologize a thousand times for the way I've treated you. I should have listened. Thus with a kiss, I die! What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand. I don't want our story to end in tragedy. And left no friendly drop to help me after? O happy dagger, this is thy sheath. There rest and let me die. Neither do I. Whoever reads this. I mean every word. I love you. What do I mean by love? That love is patient and I will be patient with you. Love is kind. And kindness I'll give to you. Love does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. I will surrender my pride for you. Love does not dishonor others. It is not self seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil. But rejoices with the truth. Love always protects. It always trusts. And always hopes. Love always perseveres. Charity? And love... never... fails. Together.
