It is not a crime. Some people are okay with being single. - I'm not. - Oh, I know. But I'm trying something new. You should try a new man. You know how hard it is to find a decent man? They're either married or trifling or I don't know. No, I'm good. What you should try is online dating. You want me to put a profile up and click a picture and be like, I like you. - Yes! - No! That's weird. No it's not. You know my homegirl down at the bank, Nisha, with the big butt? - Right. - Right. She met her a complete man, has a wonderful career. He is cute. A very decent 401K, I'm just saying. You know, I don't want to put the brother business out there, but it's decent. Wait, Nisha's man? - Yes. - So, she met him on Blaze? Yes. Wait, what's his name?

Aye man, I know I'm not watching you make a profile on your own dating website. I know that's not what's happening right now. No, no, no. I just need to prove that my dating site is good because I know that it's good. It's just people tripping with these comments, these reviews, man. You worried about comments on the Internet? Bro, look at me, man. Look at your hairline. Well, you can't look at it, but look at my hairline. Look at this part. Bro, we are crafted to perfection, all right. We don't need no Internet to get girls, man. No disrespect to your site, I'm just saying. - That's the point, fool. - I know we don't need it. It's not for us. But some people who really need this stuff to make a love connection, you know what I'm saying. So, I'm gonna make the profile, prove that it works. Then I'll be able to call these people out on their bullshit, you know what I'm saying. Look, made a profile, that easy. Done. Okay, that plan sucks. And your username is B-red? That's whack. That's what we going with? I can't use my real name, man, come on. So, they don't have a picture of you on your site? Nope, they don't know what I look like. So look, once I put these pictures up, it's gonna get real. Yeah, I feel you. I feel you. No, it's still weak. Don't do that. That's whack. And I'm not wasting a haircut in here with you, all right.

Where do you find these guys? Oh everywhere. Have fun. What you doing over there? Just browsing. Looks like a few things over there. What you browsing for? These men look good. Right, and I think I found an interesting one. Okay. So, check it, he's an entrepreneur. No kids. Jackpot. Exactly. We were messaging earlier this morning. I'm trying to see if he's online. I mean nothing really is popping off, but, you know, it's interesting. You never know. Oh, so just send him some sexy pictures like mm, ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, but he's a stranger. I don't know him. That's how you get chose out. That's how you get bagged. So, you want me to send pictures of my tits and ass to a random guy? Yeah, yeah. Oh no thank you. I don't want to be chosen like that. Okay. So, you can do it your librarian way, but it's okay if you want to live a little, Cozi. It's okay. No, I like being a librarian. Okay, so it looks like you probably may have found someone to share those boring Saturday nights with. Sounds like a plan. - Okay. - Two brain peas in a pod. Good luck. But, for me, I will be going on my date tonight with a CEO. I will talk to you later. Bye, have fun. Lock up. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Rough night? What happened to you? Long date.

You ain't come to give me these earrings. Well, I was here to check on you. I want to see how my friend was doing. Okay. I was being nosy and I wanted to see what was up with that guy from last night. There we go, there we go. The truth comes out. Well, we have been messaging each other all night. Ooh. So, you got his number, huh? Yep, he gave it to me. Okay, so you gonna call him? What the hell you waiting for? No, that's gonna be like way too fast. It's 2019, you better move! This is not the '50s, girl. 'Cause if you don't, some Insta-thot gonna grab him right up. And you not gonna have no date for the Valentine's Day. And you won't be chilling with me because I will be with a man. Oh, I don't want to be with you on Valentine's Day anyway. - Perfect. - Thank you. - All right. - But I don't know about this online dating thing. It makes me a little wary. I mean, what if he's crazy? No, I got your back. I'll go with you. Like a chaperone? No. Yeah. A little bit. - Okay. - Okay. I'll be there. I'm gonna check him out first, make sure he's not crazy, but if he is crazy, I'm gonna beat his ass. That's true, I like that. That sounds easy enough, okay. So, you would do this, right? Yes, I do it all the time. Okay. All right. I'ma just text him. Go ahead. All right. Okay, so what you gonna say? 'Cause I know you corny. - Ah, I know what I'ma say! - Okay, hit it. I'ma start with, Hello! - That's corny, that's corny! - Wait, I sent it! - Its on there! - Give me the phone! Give me the phone, give me the phone. - Give me the phone! - I don't want to give you the phone. Watch a master. Hey handsome. Ooh, okay. Heart eyes, heart eyes. Okay, okay, that's enough hearts. - Eggplant. - Ooh, uh-uh! - Eggplant! - No, delete the eggplant! - All right, I'll go back. - Delete the eggplant! All right, I'm deleting it.

It's not your first time. On an online dating thing, yes. He could have been crazy or creepy and I'm like actually excited. That's a little weird. It's not, it's normal. Everybody's doing it. All right, well. Okay, so we gotta focus. I need a recipe. Okay, so what's a good like dessert for Valentine's Day? I don't know, but it should have eggplant. You know what. No, you and them damn eggplants. - Sorry. - I'm thinking like red or pink hearts. Like, okay. A red... Don't do it. Aye Blaze, who am I supposed to be, yo? Look, hey Blaze. It's me.

My plan was gonna work. Look, I got a badie already on deck from the dating site. No, you don't, you lying. Let me see. Nah-uh. I don't even want to show you yet 'cause I don't want you to jinx it. You know what I'm saying, we've just been texting a little bit back and forth. Ain't nothing official, so if it don't work out, I don't want to hear your mouth, man. Oh she must be bad. Or it's another ugly girl. Trust me, this girl is definitely bad. Oh, it's like that. - Mm-hm. - What she do? Let me see. On her profile, it says she runs a food blog. That ain't no job. She sell Fit Tea too? Son, you got you an IG thot. Oh my god, this girl is not an IG thot, Rhett, or whatever the hell that is. We text a couple times back and forth, man. Seems like she got a little class and she's already agreed to meet up with me at the Redwood in a few days, so. For real? That's kinda quick, man. I'm about to join your website, sound like it's working out for you. It does work, I tried to make you a profile, bruh. Told you. Dating site works, man. So, you gonna meet this girl or what? Hell yeah, I'ma meet up with this girl. I mean I came up with this plan for different reasons but, at the same time, it's good 'cause I get to, you know, get out there with this dating thing again. Since that ugly girl broke your heart. So devastating. - Yeah, Rhett, she dumped me. - Tragic. - She broke my heart. - Mm-hm. But you know how I'ma make up for it? By texting this badie. How's your day? Oh man, you sound soft. It's not the Blaze that I know. Who are you? This is not the Blaze I once knew. We used to be warriors. It's gonna be dope. Hi. Hey. Wow. You look amazing.

Two Vodka martinis please. I'm glad you finally made it. Me too. I must say I am really having a good time. My friends and I come here all the time.

I mean, we can test those skills. What you think? But aren't you the lady who runs her own food blog, right? I do, that I do. So, maybe next time we'll make it a competitive cooking challenge? I mean, if you're up for it, of course. I don't have no problem with that as long as you're okay with losing. Oh, I don't have a problem winning at all, yeah. Extra confident now. Okay. But no, seriously, I had a real good time. Me too. You have my number, I want you to call me asap so we can do this again. I think I will, Mr Blaze. Real soon. Miss Cozi. Ajax?

She's a woman, I can tell. She's not like these other girls. Like I actually want to have more conversations with her, you know what I'm saying. And I get to prove that my site actually works. You know, 'cause I got her from my dating site. I get to shut the haters down at the same time. - You feel me. - Okay. Eh, yeah. I get it. So, why you being so secretive, man? Let me see a pic.

Okay, Ajax, why are you really here? To talk to you about my relationship. Are you serious? So, you pop up over here last night and then come back again this morning unannounced, mind you, to talk about the new chic you're dating? Wow, you have some nerve. No, no, no, it's not that easy. I'm not exactly seeing her anymore, so. Really? So, did she dump you for someone better? That's funny? Mm, oh that is hilarious. That is beautiful karma, wouldn't you say?

I know and I turned him away. I kicked him out and then he came back this morning. Let me go in my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind. He dumped you, right? I dumped him. No ma'am, he dumped you. You don't remember? When that lady posted that picture of them on the beach in Trinidad? - Yes. - You remember that? - Mm-hm, thank you. - Yeah. Yeah, and he said he was sorry for walking away and he made a mistake. For walking down the beach. That's fine. A mistake or was it a choice? Well, after he said what he said, he left, and transparency? It felt good. Like I started thinking about what he was saying and it felt good to hear him say those words that just, it brought back feelings I didn't know were there. I get it, he apologized. And I know he fine. He got that accent. - Right. - He's like a tall glass of like chocolate, caramel... His body. His body. Right. But don't forget that Wednesday when that lady posted that picture and your girl found it, of the two of them hugged up, everybody seen it, even my little brother was like, ain't that your friend? Oh my god he with that big-butt girl in Trinidad - on the beach. - We remember, friend. And then everybody down at the bar knew. Right. And then everybody at the bank. - Okay, I got it. - They knew too. I remember. And I will never forget. And I know you will never let me forget. - 'Cause I'ma elephant. - Right, I know. - Thank you for that. - I'ma elephant. - I got it. - Okay. - I got it. - Never forget. I know! So, as long as you don't forget... I got it. Of course, I would never forget that. He hurt me, I know. 'Cause your girl was here, solid as a rock here. - But I just... - Right here. I can't help feeling a little curious. I'm wondering what he's up to, like what, I don't know. I don't even know how I feel. Why? Why do you need to know what is he up to? We have history. History is what? Old news. It's easier said than done. Yes, I know, I want to walk away. I want to let it go, I want to not think about it. But when he was here in my face saying all that, it just, I don't know. It just made me feel a way. Some type of way. Can I please have some wine 'cause I'm feeling some kinda way. I'm stressed. These are ugly, can I... They're cute, I'm sorry. Thank you! They're just not for me.

I don't really go to guys' houses that I barely know on the first date for dinner. Like I'm just not that girl. I just had to say that. Okay. So, what changed? What's so different? I feel very comfortable being around you. And I don't get the creeper vibe, so there's that. Creeper vibes? I don't even know how to accept that. That's not a compliment. Creeper vibes, well, whatever. I'll take it right now. Oh, but I do have my pepper spray in the bag, just in case. Pepper spray, for me? In the bag right now? And hot sauce and some seasoning. I just, you know, I wanted to be able to eat the food and I just didn't know. Wow. I better be on my best behavior then. As you should. But, no, honestly, you would never have to worry about anything from me. I got sisters and I would never want anyone to hurt or disrespect them. So, I always make sure I'm respectful to the females. Nice. Plus, I'm a gentleman, you know. Still a few of us still out here. Wow, chivalry isn't dead. Like on an online dating site? Why, what's wrong with that? I don't know, it's my first time, so I'm not really an online dater. You know? I can understand that, but you know what I'm saying, it's 2019, things have changed and people are looking for love anywhere they can find it, so I'm willing to give it a try, you know. So, what about you? What do you think about the site, you know what I'm saying? Meet anybody else, anymore match-ups, hook-ups? You got anymore dates lined up? Wow, look at you. Somebody's fishing for info. - Oh, I'm fishing? - Yeah. Okay, you got me. Yeah, I'm plotting a little bit. Well, it's my first time being online on any site. This is my first online date. You were my first online candidate, if you will. I don't know, you're my first in everything in all of this. You're the lucky first. Okay, well, I'm glad to be your first. Hopefully, I'll be your last, right? Time will tell. Right. You like it? It's cool? So far, so good, you know. I don't have anything to compare it to, so there's that. What about you? Is this your first online date or are you the serial dater like this is your thing? Okay, first I'm a creeper, now I'm a serial dater? You just coming with all of it. Yes, yes, that is my thing. I lure pretty girls like you to my house. Cook 'em elaborate dinners. That's my MO, okay. That's very specific. Let me stop playing with you. But no, honestly, this is my first time as well. I just want to try something new, you know, switch it up a little bit. - Yeah. - I'm glad I did because I found you. I agree. But I have to thank my best friend. She really twisted my arm to set up an online profile. She also gave me this dress to wear tonight. Okay, your best friend. And I wouldn't have met you. Sounds like I need to send her a thank you card. Sounds like it. She gonna be the reason we get married. Oh gosh, you don't want to hear that speech. But no, I was thinking, you know what I mean, since you like the site so much maybe you can give a review on yours on the blog? Tell all your readers and viewers about it, you know? I mean, it's just a thought. Maybe I could. But you know what I was thinking? That next time I should cook for you. Oh okay. So, I've earned a second date, that's what you saying? I guess you have. Look who's plotting now. Maybe a little bit. So, what's up? I'm with it. You free tomorrow, let's do this. Well, tomorrow, I'm not available. We have a girl's night planned, so. Oh my god, girl's night. I already know how that goes. It's good, I ain't tripping. I know you're a busy girl or whatever. So, what about next week? Valentine's Day? You gonna be free? So, wait, you want to hang out on Valentine's Day? So, why you looking at me like I'm a weirdo now? No, actually, I'm not. I... I can't stop smiling, actually, so. Listen to me. I'm not really trying to sound like a weirdo or anything, but I'm not doing anything Valentine's Day. And, if you don't have any plans and you're not doing anything, I would really like to spend my Valentine's Day with you. If that's okay? I like that. I think we can definitely make that happen. Good. Sounds like Miss Cozi is gonna be my valentine. It looks that way, yes. Speaking of Cozi, I've been meaning to ask you this, I'm sorry, your name, it's very unique. I've never heard anything like it. I mean is it short for something else? Yes, so my full name is Cozette Newton and Cozi came from my mom. So, when I was a baby she would wrap me up in a blanket and she would say, you're just so cozy, you're so cozy. And the nickname just kinda stuck. So, I'm lovable, huggable Cozi. Cute. Okay. Sounds like I'm gonna be getting a lot of hugs in the future. Yeah, you play your cards right, you definitely will. Okay, but what about you? Because when I first saw your name online, I thought about an American gladiator. I don't know, just Blaze! I don't know. Oh my god. You just don't know how much I got teased about my name when I was little, man. I've heard it all, but it's the same way. My mom wanted me to be unique. She wanted me to stand out. So, that's why she gave me this name. You never forget it when you hear it. Hey, Blaze works. You're definitely unique. Blaze and Cozi. Blaze and Cozi. 2019 American gladiators. I love it. To Valentine's Day. To Valentine's Day. Oh, so you just in the kitchen eating a big ass bowl of cereal, huh? Hey man, this isn't even about me, all right. Why you got so much food in your fridge? It's a refrigerator, man. It's supposed to have food in it, fool! What you talking about? Nah man, this is different. It's like Tupperware and collard greens and yams. I never seen you cook like that. I never seen you cook. You had a girl over here? Okay, okay, nice detective work, buddy. It's the Internet girl. Internet girl, right? Yes, I invited her over. I cooked her dinner. It was great. She loved it, she loved me. And guess what? I'ma see her again on Valentine's Day. Uh! Who are you? - Valentine's Day, for what? - What, what you tripping for? Man, that ain't your girl. You ain't even wait for her. Well, what's the problem? I don't get it, what's wrong? Who is she, man? Who is she? She still a mystery to me. She's not no mystery girl, okay. Her name is Cozi, all right. You happy now? Cozi? Yeah, that's her name. Cozi, it's short for Cozette. What, what, what you looking stupid for? Please tell me you did not used to date this girl, man. Nah, but my boy is. You never heard me bring up Ajax before? Ajax? What the hell kinda name is Ajax? Hell no, I mean, Blaze. Whatever dog, yeah. But, yeah, he brought her to the bar a couple of days ago, your spot matter of fact. And he kissed her and said that's his shortie. No, no, no, no, no, no way. - Not my girl. - Cozi. Aye man, it's two girls named Cozi, that's all I'm saying. No, no, no, no, no, you gotta have her mixed up with somebody else, bro. No way, not my girl. - Yeah. - Are you, no! You got to have it wrong. Matter of fact, I'll show you a picture and we can end this right now. 'Cause ain't no way you talking about my girl. Bam. That's Cozi. Huh! That is definitely her. That's the same chick, man. I don't forget a face. She bad, okay, you know me. She bad, I seen her. That's who it was, man. Wow. I'm sorry I had to break it to you. No man, it's all... It's cool, like I said, you the homie. And I would rather you tell me that anybody else, you know what I'm saying. It's better than I heard it now than later. Right. Damn. Thought she was different. Your website sucks. I hate it. You love this dress. Well, I hate that you're wearing it on a date with Ajax. Why are you even entertaining him and his nonsense? What's wrong with going on a date with a guy? Nothing. Unless it's your ex. Well, sometimes you just do things that doesn't always make sense. We do, which is why I won't be able to help you tonight pick out a dress, but when you go out with the Blaze guy again, I will be happy to come over and help you pick out any outfit. I just went out with him last night and we had a great dinner. It was good. But tonight you're gonna go out with your ex, ass backwards. You're the one that told me to start dating, right. I'm dating. Yeah, rich, smart, classy guys. Not your lying-ass ex. Rich, smart, classy guys. I think you are really looking into this way too much. I'm not dating Ajax. We're just hanging out and I'm showing him what he's missing. You know how you show somebody what they're missing? You pay them dust. You don't put on a fly dress and waste that beautiful contour for him. Well, friend, I'm just having fun and I thought you would be able to understand that. Girl, you're lying to me and you're lying to yourself. You miss him. You want him back. I get it. That's your ex and it's familiar. But guess what? He's in your past and that's where he should stay. You gotta move forward. Something new, somebody new, not him. And I know you're scared but, sis, this ain't it. I wish you weren't going out with Ajax tonight. But I can't tell you what to do. He's your past, sis. But, as for me, I'm going home. No dates and I'm fine with that. Friend. Yo, yo, yo, what's up guys? This your boy Raz and I'm here to give you another virtual review on the dating site Yeah, you guys might know it as Blaze Dates, but no, it's total shit to me. I went on another date with another girl who had a boyfriend blowing her phone up. Then he showed up. Like control your mans! Come on, man. But I should have just smashed because she was really fine, but I'm a changed brother trying to find love and Valentines, but I don't know, guys. I'm gonna try to give it another shot, but right now it's not looking too good. But, aye yo ma. Aye yo ma, come here. Maybe this shit doesn't work. Or maybe it does? Damn. Cozi, what's going on, darling? I got you home safely and yuh ain't say nothing the entire ride home. What's the problem? You showed up on my doorstep three days ago. You introduced me to your friend as your lady. Don't you think we need to talk about this? We talked at lunch. We talked at dinner. About regular stuff. We didn't talk about us. So, there's an us. - Thanks for bringing me home. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. That's it for the night? That's it period. Nothing about you has changed, Ajax. Why you say that? Because you're still the same guy I met. You just got better at lying. Okay, you saying that just because I asked you to come by the house and chill. Exactly. As per usual, the only thing you're worrying about is getting some ass. Cozi. Co! Cozi, Cozi, Cozi, Cozi! Listen, listen, listen. I'm sorry. All right, I know I made some mistakes, but just tell me what it is you want me to do. What you need me to do and I'll do it. I promise. I love you. I love you with every last piece of my heart. You must understand that. No. You really want me to go? I can't believe this girl. Mm. Is he ignoring me or is he just busy? Okay. Oh, that looks great. Okay. What? I cannot believe that. This is gonna look so good on the blog. See, my site does work, man. What are they talking about? I'm gonna check them all out. There some nice girls on here, man. No, he's supposed to contact me. Okay. Well. Just a quick message. Oh god I'm like a stalker. You know what. Hey Blaze. What's going on? Good, how about yourself? Great. Have I been calling you too much? Nah. You good, you know what I'm saying. I've just been real busy. This is the first time I really had enough time to call you back. Oh okay. So, what you been up to? You know the usual. Working, taking care of business, cooking. Dating. Dating? Yeah, you know, dating. Enjoying myself, living my best life. What about you? Oh, just working and stuff. Hmm, yeah cool. Well, I'm actually getting ready for a date right now. You know what I'm saying. A date? Yeah, a date. You don't have a problem with that, do you?

It getting a little cold out here. Thank you. I send you some text messages, yuh eh get them? I got 'em. Well, why yuh eh answer me? Because I've been busy. I'm working on a new e-book for the blog and I don't have time for your games, Ajax. Why it is you think I'm playing games? Because I know you. And I also know you've been telling people that we're getting back together. What the hell? Who said dat? Lalah told me she found out from Jay and we're not together so why are you telling people this? I told a couple people something, but I ain't say all of that. Come on. What does that even mean? I told a couple friends that we were getting back together, not that we're back together. That is not the same thing. Oh, I could definitely see how that's so different. I don't see what's the problem. You never do. I'm out here trying to live my life without you, okay. And you out there telling people that we're getting back together. I got guys to see. What guys? I'm out there meeting people. All right, and there maybe some people that I may like that may hear the stupid shit that you're spreading. I still don't see what the big problem is. Cozi, you know how I feel about you. And judging from the kiss the other day, I'm pretty sure I know how you feel about me to, so. Wait a minute. - What? - Oh my god. I wonder. - You wonder what? - I wonder if this little lie that you're telling is getting back to someone that I know. You mean some of the other guys that you have to see? Why is this so funny? Why can't I be out there dating new guys? Is not that you can't be out there dating new guys, is just that, I mean, come on. Is not like you're just going and get over me just so, so stop it. You think so? Listen, Cozi, you could say whatever it is you have to say to yourself so you could lie down and sleep at night. That's all right, that no problem. I don't care about all these other guys that you seeing. The only guy I care about you seeing is me. All right. So, leh we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think we're going? We going Redwoods for wings and drinks. You said the wings and drinks was tasting good so leh we go back. So, just like that, you walk in here and I'm supposed to go with you? Wha yuh have to lose? I'll be in the car. I hate him so much. So, what yuh having to eat? Cozi? Yeah, oh, I don't know. Who you macoing so? I'm not staring. Ah, okay. Cozi, you are definitely staring at somebody here. Is one of your guys here or something? You know what. Nevermind. You know what, is all right. If one of your guys is here, I don't care. I ain't care about he at all. He could be whoever he is or whatever he is, if is one thing he's not is me. So, let we have some drink and food, please, and everything will be as usual. That's it. Yeah okay.

What you doing here? Hi, I'm here to see Blaze. Is he here? He ain't here, bye! Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. Hold on, hold on. Is he really not here or are you just playing around? Blaze is out handling business right now. You need to be knocking on somebody else door, ringing somebody else doorbell. You know like Ajax? Excuse me? You heard me, woman. Oh Ajax, okay. I don't have time to explain anything to you. Any idea when he'll be back? Why, you want to stay? Wow. Yeah, no. I'll just call him or stop by later. Thanks. I might put in a good word for you. Girlfriend, answer the phone. Cozi, what is going on with you? Okay, first off, I have no idea what I'm going to make for the Valentine's Day feature for my blog. I need you to take a deep breath, take the night off. Your fans are gonna understand. But girl, what is really going on with you? Right, but Valentine's Day is right around the corner and, okay. Full transparency moment, friend. Of course, friend. I can't get him off my mind. Who? Not Ajax! No, Blaze! It's like I gotta find him and tell him the truth because I don't know what else to do. And then I saw him last night with that woman and I just felt, I just got... Oh jealous, boo. No, no, okay, yeah. Yeah, I got jealous. But I don't know why? It's not like he's my man. He's like a perfect stranger to me still. And then Ajax and all his damned lies, like, oh! I just got to fix it. I'm gonna fix it and I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna let him know the truth. I'ma tell him what happened. Okay, hold up. Go over where? It's very stalkerish. It is very stalkerish. Okay, you know what? You're right. That does sound a bit that way, but I'm not listening to you, friend. Not this time. I love you but I gotta follow my heart. I really believe if I just tell him the truth that things will be okay. So, as much as I appreciate, yeah, no, no, as much as I appreciate you telling me. Okay, you know what, friend? I love you so much, friend, I gotta go. I gotta go! Friend, friend, oh my God, I'm sorry! The phone, the phone! All right, I know what I need. I just need a little liquid courage. Oh yeah. Okay, okay, okay, all right. Okay. Ahh! Ooh, okay. All right. Hi. What's up? How are you? Wasn't really expecting to see you here. I... I know, I came by earlier and your friend, Rhett, said you weren't here, you went to make a run or something. Right. I had to go and handle some business. Was it another date or something? Another date? Really? How was your other guy? What's his name Ajax or some damn thing like that? - Okay. - What the hell kind of name is Ajax anyway? - I deserve that. - Ain't that dishwashing detergent? Can you at least here me out? I really want to explain everything thing to you. You know what, yeah. I was just gonna have a drink. Come on, let's go sit on the deck. Hey. Thank you for giving me a minute to talk to you, just to explain things. Yeah. But I wanted you to know that you got some untrue information from Rhett. Nah! What's untrue about it. He said he saw you all together at the Redwood, right. And I saw you all together last night so I'm confused about what's untrue about that. Okay, okay. Hear me. Hear me. Ajax is my ex. Okay. And he literally just popped up out of nowhere, the night of our date. And I just needed clarity, to be honest. I mean, he's an ex, he came back out of the blue, and you know how it is, you start feeling a certain way, and then they do something to make you believe or remember why they're the ex to begin with. And we've all been there, right? I mean, for me, he's my history. Cool. So, you all not together. No, we are not together. Cool, we not together either. I mean, yeah, we had a couple first dates or whatever. You can date whoever you want to date, ai'ight. It's not like we in a relationship or nothing. But I want to see you. I don't want to go backwards, I want to go forward. I want to be with someone who has a great heart, who's a great person. That's why I'm here because I wanted to be able to explain to you everything 'cause I felt like we had something. Yeah, I did feel that. But when I saw you with that other guy, man, I don't know what I felt. I felt confused, you know what I'm saying. And I felt the same way. When I saw you with the girl that really made me feel like this is who I want to be with. This is who I want to get to know. This is who I want to spend time with. It wasn't a good feeling and I'm so sorry you had to feel that way. It was just a misunderstanding, I'm so sorry. Ai'ight. I mean you saying all this To be honest, yes, those last couple days that we had, they were great. You the only thing I been able to think about. You know what I'm saying. And I thought about it, yeah, I want to see where we can go. But, no, I gotta know that this is real. You know what I'm saying? I'm not trying to do this by myself. No. I'm in it 100%. I felt the same way too. Blaze, I want to get to know you. I want to be with you. Yeah. Is that all right? Can we get to know each other? Come here. Can we get to know each other? Yeah. Oh my god. You're driving me crazy, man. Wait a minute, come here. - You cleaning me up? - Yeah. Damn. Got a little me on you. But hold on, hold on, wait a minute. What about this girl that you were on a date with? Here I am pouring out all my feelings about my ex and what happened and you're being quiet over there. So, what's up with that chic? Because you made it very clear that you were dating right now. Yeah, I was dating. But that was all because of you. I went out with that girl. Yeah, we kicked it. She was cool. You know what I mean, and she was fine. But she ain't my type. I don't want to be with her. I want to be with you. - Yeah. - Yeah. I want to be with you too. Oh, oh my god, I'm so, I gotta go. No, I'm sorry, I have to get the blog ready for tomorrow. Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. So, you really just gonna get me all excited and then leave? Are you serious? I'm sorry but tomorrow's Valentine's Day and I got to get the romantic dinner up on the blog. You know, the whole thing. Wow. Well, we can do that together. All right. I mean, I can help you cook. We can make the food, put the pictures up, print out the recipe, get it on your blog, and then it'd be done. Then we have more time to spend, you know, with each other. You would do that? Yeah. Oh, okay, let's... I would love that. I would love that. I mean we were supposed to spend Valentine's Day together anyway, right? Right, 'cause you remember we did have plans. - We did have plans. - For Valentine's Day right. Yes. Seems like someone is going to be a guest chef on my blog. Oh, so you gonna make me a guest chef? - Absolutely. - Wow. Let me call my mama. Let her know I finally made it. - You made it. - Yeah, I made it now. But, yeah, we did have plans on Valentine's Day. You do know that, right? Absolutely. So, I guess everything worked out. Everything worked out. Yeah. Thanks for your Let's go in the house. Get started.
