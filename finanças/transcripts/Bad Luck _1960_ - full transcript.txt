BAD LUCK Starring Screenplay based on the short story by Music Production Manager Directed by Unfortunately, I can't keep you anymore, Mr. Piszczyk. Please, sir, I beg you, don't fire me. it's only here that I've begun feeling like a normal person. it's only here that my bad luck hasn't followed me. It all began so long ago... I'll tell you about it. It started when I was a little boy... But I don't want to bore you with my school years. Eventually, I finished high school and was accepted to university. You might have noticed that my nose is somewhat well pronounced, and that it gives my face a... Semitic appearance. Of course, this is just a result of mixing my fathers characteristics with those of my late mother. Actually, my father belonged to the Christian Tailors Guild and he hated Jews. Especially female tailors. Nevertheless, my nose has influenced the course of my life. One day, I came to class and started walking to my seat... - Jews sit on the left! - What? I'm not a Jew. - He says he's not a Jew... - You're not a Jew? I'm not a Jew. Get lost! Look at who you're beating! Forgive us, Mr. Piszczyk. You should wear that I.D. on your chest. Have a seat on the right, please. I realized the importance that appearance played in a mans life. I envied all my friends who had no trouble approaching girls. I dreamt of meeting with a girl, of taking walks together, of professing love on park benches. I was ready to give it all my best. Unfortunately, I had no target for my desire. To help realize my dreams, I got help from the Student Union. I was resentful of any organization which was opposed to the government. I wasn't able to predict the events of history, so I joined the pro-government Party of National Unity. I have good news for you, Piszczyk. I got you a job tutoring. Take this letter to that address. - How can I ever thank you for this? - Not me. The organization. What do you want? I'm here to see the Majors wife. It's about the tutoring job. Make sure to close the gate! I'm here about the tutoring job. Splendid. Your connections are good enough for me. You can begin at once. Come in. Jola? Get down from there. You know you're not allowed to touch fathers books. I'm coming down. This is your new tutor. - Good evening. - Piszczyk. You can begin. I don't know anything. That's why I'm here. To teach you. - Shall we begin with Trigonometry? - Do you live in the dorms? - No. - That's too bad. I'd like to go there sometime. A young lady should not go to such a place. Why not? My friend has already been there. Lets get back to Trigonometry. You know what sine is, don't you? Not really. If you take a right-angle triangle, the sine is the ratio of the side opposite the acute angle to the hypotenuse... Just try to imagine this mathematical ratio... That's what sine is. She was definitely staring at me. I was sure of it! Apparently, she didn't think I was ugly. So, sine is the ratio of the side opposite the acute angle to the hypotenuse, while cosine is the ratio of the second right-angle side to the hypotenuse. You're late again, honey. I can't help it. The situation is tense. Serving your country is good, but don't forget you have a wife. - Have you finished? - Just now. Come have some tea with us. - Good evening, Daddy. - How are you, darling? This is Jola's new tutor. - I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you. - Nonsense, quite the contrary. Have a seat, please. So how are the lessons going? Splendid, Miss Jola is very intelligent. - Do you think so? - You have to be very strict with her. That wont be a problem, madam. Jola did something very important. I began to believe in myself. Come on, dad... Well, my son likes to iron his own clothes! Yes, I do. Rana, Rane... Will you go on a date with me? If I could only go out on dates! I'm not allowed to go out at night, my mother watches me like a hawk. Why? She thinks I have the devil in me. She probably used to be the same. Rana, Rane, Raner, Ranam... How about right after school? Juliet waits for me after school. Can't you ditch her? Juliet? She's a bitch. She tells my mother everything. We could take her to church, but there's no mass in the afternoon. Write this down. Rana, Rane... Maybe they'll go out one of these nights. I'll send Juliet to the vespers and you could then come here. Rana, Rane, Raner, Ranam... Please wrap it up. Well walk together. Yes, madam. - Oh, good evening! - Good evening. - Where are you going? - To see the dressmaker. - At this time? - I'll be back in fifteen minutes. - Maybe I should... - Hold on. You can walk me. My husband hates it when I go out alone at night. - Goodbye. - I'm waiting for fifteen minutes! I would like to speak with you about Jola. She's very mature for her age, but still a sensitive child. - Is it hard for her to concentrate? - Somewhat... I have a favor to ask of you. How may I help, madam? I would like for her to graduate. I'll do my best, madam. Please wait for me out here. Good evening. No doubt you find it curious that I make my calls at the pharmacy even though I have a phone at home. You'll understand when you're older. Please don't tell anyone about this. Good afternoon. Would you come in here for a minute? - Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you. I never drink it. - Nor alcohol? - Nor alcohol. That makes you very trustworthy. Here you go. This is for last month. You really did earn that money. Jola actually got a B in math. Would you like to go to the movies, tomorrow? - To the movies? - Please, don't look. With whom? With me. But in actuality, alone. Well go out after Jola's lesson. You'll watch the movies, and on the way back, you'll tell me what they were about. If anyone asks, we were together for those three hours. Three hours? Yes, you can go see the double feature. Won't the Major object to this? That wouldn't even cross his mind. Great! I love going to the movies. That's wonderful. See you tomorrow. - I see Miss Jola isn't back, yet. - No, not yet. Let me call her. Oh! Here she is! - Hi. - How do you do? So, I'm going to the movies with your mother, tomorrow. - Will you stay at home? - I always stay at home! What about your father? My father? He's preparing for a war with Lithuania. I'll come back in half an hour. Send Juliet to church. What about the movies? That doesn't matter. Just in case, I'll leave my hat here. Now I understand why my mother always gets me the ugliest tutors. Don't worry. I like you. Don't you believe me? I went to see the movies that same night so that I could tell the Majors wife what they were about. Hey, Piszczyk! It's great to see you. Were helping with the demonstration to support Marshall Pilsudski's policy. - I see, but... - No, you can't refuse. it's your turn. - But I'm tutoring at seven. - You have plenty of time. Pass me the banner, will you? - Long live Marshall Smigly! - Long live! Long live! The way I was feeling at the time, I didn't care about any of it. I kept thinking of Jola. This was supposed to be the day where I start my adulthood. I just wanted to ditch the banner and escape as soon as possible. Suddenly, I realized I was no longer at the back of the group but somewhere in the middle. I had no idea our organization had so many supporters. I became invigorated by the shouts of the crowd, even though I didn't care about Kowno. I began shouting to the crowd. To Kowno! Long live the Marshall! It turned out that these new people were not part of our group. I didn't know what to yell anymore. I was afraid that they would mistake me for a Jew again because of my nose. So I decided to yell both sayings, one for the people up front, and one for the people at the back, but only in self-defense, mind you. Long live the Marshall! Send the Jews to Madagascar! Long live Marshall Smigly! Out with the government! Out with the communist Jews! I decided there was no reason to place myself at risk since the most important thing was to go to Jola's. You're a hero, boy! You'll be fine, soon enough. Don't worry, you'll be home in no time. You shouldn't meddle in politics with a head as fragile as yours. The horrible sound of those scissors, just like those from my childhood, focused all my hate on my father. Just thinking about the fact, that I might take more money from him, made my hands shake. And I was disgusted to have to listen to his stupid, out-of-date opinions. I decided I would have to leave home and not come back. Good morning, Madam. This is Piszczyk. Oh, it's you. Jola has a new tutor. A very nice boy. And reliable. It wasn't my fault, Madam. I was forced into that demonstration. it's quite by accident that I was beaten by the police. I can't trust my daughter with someone who gets beaten by the police! I started to realize that fate was not treating me very well. In the span of one month, I was beaten for being a Jew, then for taking part in a protest, but more importantly, I lost the first love of my life! Three tickets, please. I just need one ticket. I was always envious of cadets and their sharp uniforms. They were always surrounded by girls and had the love of the entire nation. That's why I didn't mind that he stole those tickets from right under my nose. Hold on for a second, girls. Piszczyk! I suddenly recognized it was Jelonek, the laughing stock of our school. Jelonek. Where have you been? Artillery school in Wlodzimierz. How about you? University, right... Yes. Is it hard to get into the school? Of course it is! Everyone wants to go. Hey, tell me. Does anyone still wear spurs? Well, the cavalry... and communications. Hey, I have to go. Oh, what's this? See you later. Only two professions could ensure my complete independence. Military school, or the Seminary. There was a big difference in uniforms. Who could help me with this? Jola's father! He usually came home around this time except in extraordinary circumstances. After that, everything happened in the blink of an eye. I should have smacked him for stealing my idea! My imagination got the best of me. The hour that he spent there was not very pleasant for me. - Good evening, Major. - Good evening. I'm glad I caught you, Major. I have a favor to ask of you. Is it about the tutoring? No, I would like to be admitted to Military School. But I thought you were studying medicine at University. Actually, law, but I've always believed that was my mistake. I always dreamed of being in the army. Communications. I like telephones. I've already submitted my application, but there are so many candidates... What's your name? I can't remember it. Jan Piszczyk! I'll try to help you, but I'm not sure if it's even necessary. Soon, well all be going to... ...to the army. I didn't like the Majors reference, since if there was a general draft, there would be hundreds of cadets showing up at the school. The Major kept his word, and I got my admittance card to the school in Zegrze. I was told to report on September 30th, 1939. I'm sure you've already guessed what happened afterwards. The war broke out on the next day, and my dream was crushed. Even our nations bad luck could not compare to mine. On the 8th of September, I left Warsaw like most of the city's residents. What do you want? Excuse me, I'm on my way to Zegrze. I have orders to be there on the 30th, and I would like to be there early. What do I care? - Are you on your way there, too? - No, I'm going around. - What do you mean? - I'm going around Zegrze. Nieporet to Struga, Struga to Prague, Prague to Nieporet, and from... ...Nieporet to Struga! Ever since the beginning of the war? No. At first, I was at the border near Mlawa. I understand, you were with the supply columns, right? Supply columns! I'm part of the Zeppelin Brigade! But the Zeppelins were never finished, so they made me drive this supply cart. Do you happen to know where the Germans are now? Has anyone even seen them? I guess they're close. - What are you transporting? - Cases. - Food? - Don't be so curious! They say it's a new weapon, but I can't open it without orders. Did you get any orders? Who's going to give me orders? Anyone who could went elsewhere. - it's scary to transport such cargo. - Scary? I'm used to it! Where are we? Past Nieporet, near Struga. You were supposed to wake me near Zegrze. Well be in Zegrze in the evening. If you're in a big hurry, you can go through the fields. - it's about four kilometers. - Four kilometers? - Okay, thanks. - it's a bit more than four! Hurry up, guys! Hurry! Excuse me, sir, is Zegrze in this direction or in that one? - What? - To Kowno! Uh... to Zegrze! - Lets see a picture I.D. - Yes, to Zegrze. - I need a picture I.D.! - Oh, I.D. - To Zegrze! - Quiet down. Where did you get this? From University. What's with you? I don't know. Who gave you this? What did he look like? This short guy with a mustache... - I mean, he was about your height... - What?! Well, actually, he was as tall as you! it's true, I know the guy. - Where are you from? - From Warsaw. Through here? I was ordered to report to Zegrze on September 30th. On the 30th? A little early... ...or actually, a little late. I'm not sure if anyone is there anymore! I'll check anyway. If you'd like. Its five kilometers that way! Five? - To Zegrze, right? - To Zegrze. - That way? - Yes, five kilometers. Hands up! The Germans did not want to believe my explanation. They said that civilians do not change into uniforms during war. I was so embarrassed by my stupidity that I couldn't bring myself to tell the truth to these imprisoned officers. Were neighbors. - 2nd Warrant Officer Sawicki. - 2nd Warrant Officer Piszczyk. You went to war in your dress uniform? No, I was in the hospital when the war started. They wouldn't let me out. Can you believe it? I missed the war because of some stupid pneumonia! So I had to escape. Out the window. What about the uniform? When I got to Zegrze there were no uniforms left. So you haven't even had a chance to fight... Of course I did! I joined a division near Mlawa. We went through hell! But I'm sure you understand. Where were you captured? Near Nieporet. The planes were ripping us to pieces! Heads were flying! Our Major was blown up right along with his horse. I'm the only one who survived from our company. I'm pretty sure everyone in my squadron is dead, too. All of a sudden, some tanks came out of the forest. We had some anti-armor ammunition, so I turned the machine gun around... Over the next few day, I began adding many specific details to my story. I was no longer afraid of being discovered, which was mainly due to Sawickis friendship and confidence. Excuse me, this will take just a moment. Excuse me. - I have examined the terrain. - Terrain, yes. We could try to dig our way out. What do you think? Dig our way out? Well, yes, well have to think it through. Do you think well be able to? Of course well be able to. Its only thirteen meters to the fence. - Thirteen meters? - Thirteen. Thirteen... Then, let's do it. I knew you wouldn't let me down! I secretly hoped that something would interfere with this dangerous plan. And indeed, after roll call, we got a new transport of prisoners-of-war. 2nd Warrant Officer Piszczyk. Osewski. 2nd Warrant Officer Krawczyk. Judging by your badges, you're from Zegrze. Yes. - From the second year, right? - Yes. - I'm also from the second year. - Really? How is it that I never had the honor of meeting you in two years? That's very strange... Careful! Spy! Please, Ensign, could you speak with your superior on my behalf? What superior? My father was a P.O.W. during the first war. He also mentioned that the Germans would send spies into the camp. How stupid of them... Gentlemen, it's not true. I'm not a spy. I wanted to go to war, so I found this uniform in some abandoned barracks... Did you hear anything? No, I didn't. Gentlemen... Friends, I'm not a spy... This way, please. I left the camp by volunteering for physical work in the factory. I was allowed to choose between work in a sewing factory, or in the arsenal. The choice was very easy. I couldn't stand the sound of scissors anymore. They released me from work for incompetence, and I went back to Warsaw. I owed it all to physical weakness and my hatred of scissors. - Jelonek! - Piszczyk! For Gods sake! I could recognize that nose anywhere! - What can they do to us? - Anything they want to. Don't worry, we'll talk. Herr Kommendant, here is my I.D. Shut up! Herr Hauptmann, here is my I.D. I'm a bombed invalid. Three kids... Five kids! My wife is pregnant! My father is paralyzed! My whole family is in the hospital! I've been released from a work camp. I was working for Germany. I made bombs for Germany. Here is another piece of I.D. This is my best one. Everything's in order. You may go. You seem to be doing well. Where did you get the ring? From my friends grandfather. Do you want one? - I don't have any money. - I can tell by your clothes. Why would you taunt the Germans with an old uniform? I just came back from a work camp. They let you out? Maybe you have German ancestry. Are you kidding? I'm unfit for physical work. Let me see that I.D. Were you in a camp, too? Or were you at the school? Are you serious? I'm not going to waste the best years of my life. When the Germans invaded, I took off the uniform. How about you? I put on a uniform... A little too late. Survival of the fittest. Anyway, This is a very nice I.D. Do you want to make some money? Sure, why not? I need someone to help me out. Driver, were getting out right there! Don't forget the package. - That's twenty Zloty. - Here you go. Now, go see your daddy, and then sleep. I can't... The prodigal son returns. Come and enter the castle gate. You'll soon meet Queen Zosia. Come in, Jasiek. I got married before curfew because it was boring after eight o'clock. - This is my wife. - Good evening. Zosia, our friend here will stay with us for a while. Should I serve dinner? No, we've already eaten. Come! This is where you'll sleep until you get married and find an apartment. Thanks to that little piece of I.D., which protected me from the Germans, I became Jeloneks commissioner and took care of his errands. - Greeting, Mr. Ber. - Greetings. The screw is bent. I do not have that size in stock. - The screw? - Yes, the screw. - The screw? - Yes, the screw. - The merchandise? - The money? Stop it, please. How come none of them work? I hate the ticking. It bothers me while I work. I was well off in no time. I had Jelonek's full confidence. And I started running the business independently. Don't bring me such crap in the future. What's this? - Here. - Thank you. At your service. Let me have the money! There's a nice piece for sale. I felt like a good person, like a hero from a song. I thought it might be a good idea to visit Jola. - Good morning, Jola. - Good morning. I've just returned to Warsaw. - You don't recognize me, do you? - Of course I do. Come in, please. This is my pre-war tutor. My fiancee. My friend, Basia. Pleased to meet you. Have a seat, please. - Continue with the story. - That was pretty much it. So how did it end? We rushed out from Krucza street, and saw three men with metal hats. We started to shoot, rat-tat-tat, and were home by six. Fantastic. Oh, come here. How are you parents doing? My mother is baking cakes, and my fathers in an officers camp. I was in a camp too. A soldier's camp. And you escaped? I came to the conclusion that it's more comfortable in Warsaw. When were you captured? Half way through September. So you fought on the Northern front? - Yes... - Which army? Uh... we marched from the Prussian border to Mlawa. So you were captured during which battle? During the battle of Nieporet. What a battle! We were surrounded by two German divisions. I had used up all my ammunition, and didn't even have one for myself... Oh God! What do you expect? After the capitulation of Warsaw, I saw a young lieutenant jump from the fifth storey of a building. - He probably had no bullets. - Tell us about the P.O.W. camp. The P.O.W. camp? Well, in the camp... ...Kriegsgefangenenpost. What do you intend to do now? Well, I'll have to look around. I still have contacts from the camp. You can always count on us. Thank you. You've really changed, Jola. - it's all thanks to him. - I have to go now. I'm also on my way out. Good bye, Jola. Good bye, friend. And good luck. See how great he is? Sure, whatever. Let's get back to the trigonometry. I can't allow a woman to carry something heavy in my presence. Everyone should carry their own briefcase. What do you have in it? Did I ask you how you escaped from the camp? If you're afraid, you don't have to walk with me. I would walk with you even if I had to face machine guns and bombs. So how do you escape from a camp? The original method is by digging a tunnel. One of my friends started digging in September, but still hasn't finished. - You can always dress up as a German. - But how do you get a uniform? You have to make it yourself. Out of paper, for instance. You just have to pick a sunny day so that rain doesn't ruin it. The best way is to use a bike left by a German soldier who came to the camps headquarters. it's all so interesting! But I have to go to Bielany now. Don't look behind you. Do you have any I.D.? Don't be afraid. - November is beautiful this year. - Would you like some candy? Only peace and quiet can save us. Will I see you again sometime? Maybe you could sell me some candy? I have some on order! Perhaps next time! Give Jola a call tomorrow morning! That is how the greatest love of my life began. Here I am! it's very dangerous in town tonight. I'm just glad that our boys attacked. How many gendarmes were killed? Five? Seven. They'll probably write about it in the underground newspaper. - They have famous writers, don't they? - Yes, famous writers. I'm so worried about you. You keep exposing yourself to great risk. No, this isn't the right place. But we keep meeting in town, and you never have any time. - You have plenty of time. - No, not really. - Make sure you're careful. - You too. All I do is carry candy. Will I ever be able to kiss you someday? Don't think about such nonsense. There are more important things. it's very important to me. Which district are the Germans in? In Aleje, Nowy Swiat, Mokotow, Praga, Wola... Enough? Yeah, that's enough. What bad luck! I was in such a hurry today. You have such strong nerves, Janek. That was the most wonderful moment of my life. No woman has ever looked at me like that since then. I realized that as she looked at me, she was seeing someone else. We can go now. Be careful! The avenue is surrounded all the way to the bridge. I have to be at Zoliborz as soon as possible. You definitely wont make it on time if they capture you. I'd get through if it wasn't for this briefcase. Whys that? You don't really think that I trade in candy, do you? No, of course not. So what do you carry in it? Newspapers and mail. And you want to try and cross with... I have very important information. It will be too late in the morning. Give me the briefcase. I'll bring it to you tomorrow. No, I can't place you in danger. You're working on more important things. I'm ordering you to give it to me. I'm your superior. Good night, Basia. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Be careful, I beg you! Finally! I thought they had captured you! Can't you leave your love affairs for another day? What's that? Oh... My girlfriend's candy. I have to take it to Marszalkowska Street. Maybe you should switch to trading solely in candy. it's a much safer job. it's not as much money, but it's not bad. Do you remember Majewski? They found dollars in his pocket, so he was taken to a work camp. - Do you carry money like that, too? - Yes, where else would I keep it? Where? How about in the briefcase? In between all the candy. - Hey, look at that. - What? - it's new, isn't it? - Are you crazy? - Supper is ready. - Lets eat. Wake up. What's your name? - Piszczyk. - Documents! - Why are you in this apartment? - I'm sleeping. Please, Inspector, this is my old friend from school. Sure, I've heard that one before. He's been hiding here for a long time. - This I.D. is forged! - I'm not afraid. The I.D. is real! How about we ask the Gestapo? I don't like your nose! - But Inspector, he's always... - Get dressed! He's always had that nose, and is a genuine Aryan. You can even check. - No, I don't want to. - Don't be an idiot. Look here. - There's no need... - Moron! You gentlemen had to get up so early, maybe we could... Ten thousand! Ten thousand? For what? This man is innocent! His name is really Piszczyk. His father has a tailors shop. it's on Sienna Street. He's famous in all of Warsaw. He even lives there, but they just got into an argument. - I'm mad at my dad. - What's with the briefcase? Well, this is my friends. It's just candy... Here's the money, Inspector. Exactly how much you asked for. I thought it was candy. Its his, I had no idea... I don't interfere in these matters. Get out of here! Now! On my way there, I never thought of the danger posed by the briefcase. I had had enough. Fate let me know it had given up harassing me. It was just like Fate to use forbidden newspapers to save me from the Gestapo. You were placed in danger needlessly. No one stopped me along the way. That doesn't matter. I have bigger problems. What happened? There was a raid at the apartment last night. I had to flee from there, and now I have no place to stay. You can stay at Jola's tonight. Tomorrow, I'll find something better. - Somewhere close? - Maybe even in this house. Why are you looking at me like that, Basia? I'm boring and ugly. When I first saw you at Jola's you did not seem very interesting. But now you're beautiful. Very beautiful. I feel dumb telling you this, since you've always viewed me so highly... What are you talking about? Those people I worked for were very unprofessional. After the raid last night, I've decided to stop dealing with them. Maybe you could find me some contacts? Of course! I've already mentioned you to some people. They're looking for people who are familiar with conditions in the Reich. That's perfect. I know a lot about this weapons factory in the Rheinland. Lets go take care of that now. Just a minute. My name is Witold. it's a pleasure. Basia told me a lot about you, Ensign. Our work is difficult. - I don't like easy tasks. - Great. Everyone you'll meet has already visited the Reich at least once. You can tell us about yourself. We have to get to know each other. Go one, darling. Come in. Come in, please. Ensign Sawicki recognized me, unfortunately. I fled from Warsaw that same night. I spent the rest of the war hiding out with my uncle in the country. I came the the conclusion that fate would leave me alone as long as I kept away from any action. I guess it shunned cheap tricks like cutting off my ear with a scythe. When we were finally liberated I immediately went to Warsaw. - Have you found anything? - No, nothing. You're Mr. Piszczyk, aren't you? You recognize me? You'd recognize me, too, except that recently, I gained... My name is Wasik, I used to live here. Are you also a tailor? No, I'm a student. I was a tax collector, but now I'm planning something more independent. - What did you study? - Law. I have an idea. I'll help you out. Warsaw will be desolate for a hundred years. You can come with me. I need a lawyer. - But I don't have a diploma. - Diploma? Come with me and I'll explain everything. Our hands will swell from so much work, Mr. Piszczyk. Do you know how many offices are being opened every day? Or how many people are coming back from labor and P.O.W. camps? And it takes them at least one hundred applications to rebuild their existence. Were going to make a lot of money, Mr. Piszczyk. - Is this new? - it's new. Only... I don't know how to write applications. You don't know? Here's the book you need. You'll learn in two hours. The book contained many formulas for all types of occasions. I learned to open the book in a drawer so that the client would not notice. The most frequent requests that we received were for a death certificate for a lost person. The work was simple. I would rewrite the formula, word for word, and I would only have to substitute the persons first and last names. The date of death was always the same since it had to do with the war. May 8th, 1945. It was much harder when it came to widows pensions. I had to listen to long stories about work, unemployment, military service, and then write down almost two full pages. There were many store owners who tried to get exemption from taxes. I had to listen to their dramatic stories of low income, sick mothers, invalid brothers and other misfortunes which seemed to befall them with amazing cruelty. Over time, I developed a fondness for money. I dreamt about a comfortable and peaceful life. But fate... Come in, please. Just one moment. I will be with you in a second. I should have guessed that the appearance of a woman in my life is an omen of a forthcoming disaster. What can I do for you, Madam? - Irena Kropaczynska. - Jan Piszczyk. Listen, first we have to... Don't forget, we have a conference in an hour at the District. Yes, of course. Well, I don't want to disturb you. I'll be in the Tax Collectors office. All right. Please, sit down. What can I do for you? I would like to file for divorce. Divorce? What is the plaintiffs... uh... your husbands name? Witold Kropaczynski. A civil servant. Why do you want a divorce? - My husband is cheating on me. - How strange... You have some evidence, right? No, I don't. But I'm sure he has a mistress. But the court needs some evidence, witnesses. That's why I came to see you. I was told you could help. I don't understand. I'm all alone, so you're the only one I could ask for this favor, which I will reward, of course. What do you mean? We have to find out where my husband is going. I'm sure he has a lover. There must be a mistake. I'm a lawyer, not a private detective. That's funny. There are no private detectives in Poland. This is just like going for a walk. You have no idea how horrible he is. He's a monster. You'll be doing a very good deed. - Money is not an issue. - Madam, I understand all that. But I have a feeling that by doing this, I will be breaking the law. Why? Does the law forbid helping a woman in need? - What if we fail? - We cannot fail. In any case, you can keep this payment. I began to wonder where he was calling now that he knew of his wife's betrayal? Maybe his mistress, to tell her of his decision to leave his wife? - You're supposed to knock. - Oh, excuse me. You've met Mrs. Makulec before, haven't you? And this is my best friend, Mr. Pytel, from the Tax Collectors office. Will you have a drink with us? No, thank you. I don't drink Vodka. Besides, I have some more work to do. Don't be silly. There are no clients today. Sorry gentlemen, the office is closed until 2pm. Well be open after lunch. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I have nothing to do. We're from the Security Police. We have a warrant to search this office. Please, go ahead. - Anastazja Makulec? - Yes, that's me. I just came here... - Do you own a haberdasher shop? - Yes, that's right. Mr. Pytel was on his way to my shop and stopped by to see Mr. Wasik, and we were here to... Quiet down. What's this? Pocket change? I'm from the Tax Collectors office. This is my money. I have nothing to do with them. Look, there's only three glasses on the table. I've been saving this money for two years, and didn't buy anything. I denied myself everything. I didn't go to the movies, or buy cookies... That's enough whining. I only dreamt of having money, lots of money... Lets go. Tell us your life story. I would just like to say that I have nothing to do with Wasik's business. He did it all in secret. I just came there right before you... Fine! Fine! Your life story. I was born on May 12th, 1916, to Cezary Piszczyk, a ladies tailor, and my mothers name was Wiktoria. I told my life story as if I was in confession. I feared telling the story of the uniform, so I made sure to describe all my wartime experiences very vividly. I was afraid that this officer would suspect me of spying for the Nazis. There was no one who could testify that I just put it on for fun. What are you babbling about? I swear I'm telling the truth. I'd like to be part of this new life, and become a helpful citizen. I want to work in whichever field the State needs me to work in. Are you confessing to all the charges? Which charges? I already told you that Wasik... Shut up with this Wasik! Don't make me out to be a fool! You're part of a secret organization working for foreign intelligence. That right. I mean... no! If you confess to everything you will be shown mercy. You were lured into this because of your stupidity, right? No! I don't belong to any organization! I never spoke with anybody about any organization! Really? Then who asked you to follow Mr. Kropaczynski? Well? It didn't surprise me that I was the one who had brought the Security Police down on Wasik and his bribers. After a few more interrogations I was released from prison. I left Krakow just as I had left Warsaw. I spent the next few years working as a low-level official. Unfortunately, people are never pleased with what they have. I decided to look for a new job. Good morning. What? What do you want? I'm here to see the head of the Staff Department. - Do you have a pass? - Yes, I do. - Room 125, 1st floor. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning, how may I help you? I was told to report for work today. - Your name? - Piszczyk. Please, come in. Fill out this form. And make sure to print right here. Yes, comrade. By writing tailor under the heading Fathers Profession, I was automatically considered a socially advanced person. I didn't think it was good to mention the Pre-war Student Organization. I wasn't able to join the Underground. My parents did not own any land. I never traveled abroad. I had no relatives outside of Poland. I didn't mention my time in prison, since it was all a mistake. In other words, my answers were almost perfect, and I would have been at ease, if only he had been a little less inquisitive. It seemed as if he already knew something about me. You have very nice handwriting. Very good. We need an editor for our office newspaper. - I hope you wont refuse. - No, of course not. I think propaganda is one of the most important aspects of our time. Please report to the Head of the Propaganda and Statistics dept. Yes, Comrade. Yes, of course. Good morning. - My name is Piszczyk. - I'm very happy to meet you. We have a very important statistical task to accomplish. I would like to place you in charge of that. - I'm sure you'll find it interesting. - Yes, Comrade. I want to devote all my power to building a new life. Please familiarize yourself with the instructions. That will be your desk. And this is Mrs. Wychowna. There were a lot these statistical reports to go through. The provincial branches sent them at the last moment, and we had to get them out as fast as possible. I took the work very seriously. Yes, Comrade President, yes, of course. I'm very happy with you, Piszczyk. This is clean and solid work. Your appreciation will drive me to work even harder. Very nice, Piszczyk. Very nice, indeed. You know what? You should not be doing all of this by yourself. We need to get you a staff. What do you think about Kozienicki? He was laughing at our newspaper. He does not like what we write. You really think so? He also doesn't like me, because I don't hide my positive opinions about this place and in my personal life. He even mocks you. - What, me? - And how often! It seemed to me like I had finally reached the pinnacle of success. Soon, I gained complete independence, even with Kozienicki's objections, who wanted to minimize the importance of statistical reports. I grew in status, just as my office grew in size. We were no longer flooded with reports from the provincial branches. Now the branches were terrorized by the flood of my new statistical forms. Our new machines could calculate anything. For instance, how many paper clips does each one of our clerks use? This was a very important factor in judging their efficiency. You've been nominated for an award. You don't know how happy I am! - Who nominated me? - The director. For all your outstanding work. He has personally approved this! Kozienicki is furious! He said the world is ending if such idiots get awards! Thank you, thank you very much. Now... to work. Pour me some, Piszczyk. Will we write about this celebration in our newspaper? Yes, we will. You deserve this, Piszczyk. Thank you. This award will drive me to do even better work. You don't really know much about life, Piszczyk. Your father made very good money, so your childhood was soft. He sent you to university... That's why I stopped talking to him. I was disgusted by his middleclass-ness. So you abandoned your own class. Yes... I abandoned it... I abandoned it completely! I changed the subject because my life story was a dangerous topic. Why talk about those old days? Now is a good time to be alive! You're happy, aren't you, Piszczyk? I am so happy. You have no idea what this celebration means to me. This is the first time in my life that... Not to mention how excited I get to see how life is going! Don't give him that much beer, Comrade Kacperski. Why not? Were consuming much more beer now, than we did before the war. For instance, I never drank beer before the war. it's only now that I've found my real place in the world. Everything I've accomplished was through my hard work and effort! Kacperski, I don't know if... You're a strange man. You keep talking as if you're sincere. But for the last two years, I haven't been able to figure you out. What's there to figure out? I've been figured out! Completely! I always say what I mean. I can tell you anything. To your health. Kacperski... Bruderschaft? - Call me Janek. - Jozek. Long live Piszczyk! Good morning, Mrs. Cybulska. Good morning, Mr. Mioduszewski. I said, good morning, Mr. Mioduszewski! - Are you still here? - Where else should I be? I was distressed by what he said. I sensed misfortune deep in my heart. Directors office. This is Piszczyk. The Director is busy. When will he be available? This is very important. I don't know. Not anytime soon. Jozek... How are you? Yes, Piszczyk? What do you want? Oh, nothing. Suddenly, I felt a knot of fear in my throat. I wanted to avoid this terrible, new attack of bad luck. I was ready to tell them about the pre-war organization, about everything, including Kropaczynskis investigation. God, how stupid I was to think that I could keep it all a secret! Mr. Piszczyk is being asked to come to the Directors office. I'm on my way. Come closer. Come on. Have a seat. You've deceived us, Piszczyk. We've treated you very well, but instead of showing your gratitude, you've decided to reveal the evil soul of the enemy. I have to admit that I used to belong to that pro-government organization because I wanted to be a tutor, but I haven't done anything bad here. I know there are some who think that I want their job. I have undeniable evidence. As far as this confession is concerned, that will require a separate investigation. One second, Comrade Kacperski. You were drunk after those beers, right? That doesn't justify anything. Besides, truth always comes out when a man is drunk. I wasn't drunk. So everything you did yesterday was with full conscience? Yes. I can even repeat every word I said. I said that I was very happy, that now is a good time to be alive... Yes, this lie about now being a good time to be alive is to distract us. I've suspected you for a long time, Piszczyk, because of your enthusiasm. - It was all a pretense. - A pretense? I was pretending? What exactly was I pretending? I just did the best I could. No other office in Poland has such a model Statistics Department. Even now, I'm adding a new appendage to Statistics Form #112B... I worked on this with all my heart, I did it all sincerely. Kacperski, I give you my word, I love these reports. Why would I pretend? No, this is too much. I am not the right person to settle this matter. We have to settle this matter now. Come with us, Piszczyk. No, not right now. Just a little further. Do you have a pencil, Piszczyk? - I do. - Then write. What should I write? How about you dictate to him, Director? - How about Kozienicki? - Me? Don't you know how to? I do. Write it exactly as I dictate. Tooth. Soup. House. - What? Write it. - Write what? Just that. Tooth, soup, house. What? Under the picture, I could see an obscene insult in my handwriting. Well, I believe there is no more doubt that this is his handwriting. It wasn't me! It was him! Him! I'll show you! I must have been obsessed. I was arrested for attempted murder and sent here. Please don't throw me out of here. it's only now that this bad luck has stopped following me. Please, sir, I beg you... Sir? What? Please, don't throw me out. Unfortunately, Mr. Piszczyk, I can't keep you here any longer. Sir, I'm afraid of having to start all over again. But you're free to go and do whatever you want. - Couldn't I stay here to help out? - No. - How about writing wall newspapers? - What? Where? In every corridor. In every cell. Everywhere! No! Please leave immediately! How about Statistical reports? That's enough! Please go away! Well? THE END
