It's Morning in America, and I'm having myself one lucky day. Ah! Ah! Oh! Ah! (glass shattering) Forgot to feed the plants. Maybe it's you who needs a feeding. The engine is running now. You're built like a shit brick house. I'm riding you... riding you like a... like a... Oh! Ride 'em, cowboy! ...Oh, doggie! Oh yeah! (gunshots) Yee-haw! ...Ride "em, cowboy! (gunshots) Oh! Yes! (giggles) Touchdown! (marching band music plays) I could hear Camille all the way down the hall last night. Don't want to brag or nothin'. Well, Kevin, you owe me a game of H-O-R-S-E for setting you up. Wish I could, but I got urgent business. What the fuck is that? "Cindy Does SINcinnati," huh? Where did you get this? A high school buddy. With these VCRs, it's like having a porn theater in your own dorm room. Man, oh, man. Cindy's got the biggest jugs this side of the Rio Grande. Put it on. I don't know, Justin. I'm not sure you would enjoy it as much as I would. Oh! Yes! All guys go through phases like this. Mine's just taking longer than usual. Aren't you done yet? When you're bigger than Dallas, it takes longer Oh, man. Look at Cindy's bush. Want to try some lube? . I'll show you. (slippery sounds) What the fuck are you doing, dude? Nothing. Where did you get that shit? Just keep your eyes on her. Oh! Here it comes. Here it comes. Oh! Oh! Good flick. A classic is a classic. So...what's the plan Saturday? The girls are going to be in Austin for the game by 6. You provide the wheels - I provide the brewskies. Pickups, pussy and Longhorns football. It don't get better than that! (splat sound) Man, I wish I could have made it down to the game on Saturday. Man, I wish I could have made it down to the game on Saturday. And I wish I could have made it up to the cabin. Come on, dude. We ain't seen each other since this summer. Danny is going to be here, too. They give you guys a whole week for fall break? Give or take a day. Or two. Or three. Someone needs to get serious about their education. I'll turn queer before that happens. Too late, boy. You're already queer Eat me - whole. I love our guy talk. Steve, I got a couple of midterms coming up. You can study here. That dog don't hunt. Did I mention there was going to be pussy involved? Pussy-a-plenty. I'll think about it. - Pussy-o-rama. - I'm thinking about it. Pussy galore! I see your intention through your dark-blue denim jeans Any more intention you'd be bursting at the seams There you are, Kev. Camille has been asking about you. Oh yeah? I've been meaning to call her (laughs hysterically) Holy shit! What's got your goat now? Will you be my date for the fall dance, Kevie-kins? If dumb were dirt, you'd cover an acre. Well, if brains was dynamite, you couldn't blow your nose. It's "Wear Jeans If You're Gay Day," numb nuts. Yeah. Run. You better hurry now. Hurry on. Hi there. Haven't seen you around the dorm before, I'm new... Cesar. Kevin. Nice to meet you, Kevin, You know, "It's Wear Jeans If You're Gay Day." Of course. I organized it Oh... shit. That's cool. Strange how everyone's jeans seem to be in the laundry today. There's plenty of room at the table. No - Twas just hunting for my pencil. Oh, here it is. Well, nice meeting you and all. (moaning sounds on TV) That's Cesar's probably lurking at some rest stop this very minute, or sniffing jock straps at the gym. What that poor boy must be going through. Back to blue jeans, I see. Hi. You mind if I join you? It's Caesar, right? It's Cesar. I didn't mean to disturb you. My roommate needs his privacy. Is he...? He's got about 10 girlfriends. Sometimes all in the same weekend. Sounds pretty healthy to me. If you're into that kind of thing. Hey! Why aren't you at the Saloon? Excuse me, Tinkerbell. This is a fag-free zone, Geez, Justin. Give the guy a break. Don't listen to him, You can stay if you want. Think I'd rather go. Bye, Kevin. Bye, Kevin. You better hurry! Hurry on. He didn't do anything to you. What's your problem? You ain't heard, obviously. Heard what? He got kicked out of Sigma Nu for getting down with one of the pledges. And I'm not talking about a sorority sister. Are you shitting me? Had a gallon's worth of semen pumped from his stomach because he was sucking so much cock. That's fucked up. He'd been smoking your pole if I hadn't rescued your ass. I enjoy Western Civ. It makes me think deep thoughts. Man - I could really use a blow job. Your thesis statement is bland. It doesn't say anything. Well, maybe it's because the book is bland. I mean, the author spent four pages describing a tree. A fucking tree! Then say that. Without the fucking reference, of course. I'm telling you, if you wrote like you spoke, you could get an A. - Oh, no. Not this nitwit. - You know that guy? He's in my English class. Howdy, ma'am. Knee-deep in Willa Cather here. That Willa dude don't make no sense to me, you know? Maybe you could help me with my homework sometime. I suggest that you take lessons from my brilliant tutor here. Yes, ma'am., You seen Kevin, Tinkerbell? Excuse me? Your boyfriend. Why don't you fuck off? You mean the guy who isn't a complete homophobic idiot? Yeah. No - haven't seen him. You ever want to study together... - I'm game. - Bye now. If you change your mind... Do I look like I'm going to change my mind? All right. I'm going. (knocking at door) Come in, - No time for hoops, dude. - Who said anything about baseball? I brought you some cookies... for defending me the other day. Thank you. I don't think anyone should talk to anyone like that. It's disrespectful, you know? You play football? Lettered my junior and senior year. What position did you play? Wide receiver I had a good pair of hands. Bet Miss December here appreciates that. In my humble opinion, she should have been Playmate of the Year I had my money on Miss October. No comment. - You're one of those liberals. - Try it. You'll like it. Who are these guys? The guy on the left, that's Danny, my best friend. The guy in the middle is Steve, my other best friend. Danny's the intellectual one. Steve's the lady-killer. And what are you? Just your average good ol' boy. Who can charm the skin off a rattlesnake. Nah. And you know it... Dangerous. Did you do these? I'm in a class this semester.. just for fun. They're really good. Thanks. Can I sketch you? Sketch me? I need to practice human subjects for my class. Uhh, sure. I guess so. The thing is, you have to be naked. Just what I need. I was hoping you'd come back here. What brings you back so soon? Cesar promised to meet me after dinner. We got interrupted this afternoon... If you catch my drift. Come on, don't Cesar freak you out, just a little bit? There is absolutely no reason for me to stay. Well, I was hoping maybe we could study together, you know, knock back a couple of beers. I'm curious. Just how many grades did you flunk? Only two. Why? I'm kind of modest, at least when I don't know someone that well. Should I close my eyes? I'm just asking... My mom always taught me to be polite. So be polite and tell me I'm not too damn skinny. I like skinny... it's easier to draw. Wish I was more built, but... What's that? For the newspaper. I'm teasing. I need some sort of visual reference to finish the drawing. Only when I know you better. You're the boss. (sketching sounds) Wow. He... He ain't got nothing I ain't seen in gym class. Are you going to stare or draw? Can you move for me ever so slightly, partner? How am I doing? You were born to do this. So tell me, Mr. Artiste, why do models have to be nude? The lines... Underwear interrupts the V line between the stomach and groin. I'm guessing this ain't your first rodeo. Don't know what you mean. What are you doing? I should ask you the same question. You can't just kiss me like that. What was I thinking? Look, I'm just not that kind of guy, that's all. So your hand just happened to wander down there, right? I was just getting a sense of proportion for the sketch. You're completely delusional. I'm sorry you got the wrong idea. No hard feelings, OK? You're nothing but a closet whore. You're calling ME a whore? Don't come near me! (door slamming) I can't believe I let him take advantage of me like that. Yee-hah, dude! The girls are bringing along a hot little number named Susannah just for you. There's no way I can come to the cabin. She's a sure thing, Kev... A sure thing. Are you all right, buddy? Uh, huh. You'd tell me if you weren't, right? Right? I don't know. Haven't had much luck with sure things lately. She was a semifinalist for the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, Kev. A semifinalist, can you fuckin' believe that? - Do you know what that means? - What does it mean? It means she almost made the team. Hi. Your roommate tearing up the sheets again? Go away. Cesar - don't be sore at me. I miss everyone at home, and you're the coolest person I've met here. I can talk to you. Smooth. I mean every word I'm saying. You're trouble - with a capital T. This is Freddie. That one's Jimmy. And that's Dolores. You name your plants? It's the closest thing I could have to pets growing up. My parents were funny that way. They're OK, though. You're lucky. You mind if I take a quick shower? Uhh... I need to go get some studying done. Oh, no. Stay. I won't be long. Have a seat. I'll just...watch your plants. Here's some good reading to occupy you. A sense of humor. Lots of good articles in there. Check out these bazookas. So why shower now? The bathroom is less crowded at night. I'm very shy. Should I close my eyes? Too late. Can't find my shaving creme. - You see it anywhere? - I never learn my lesson. What did you say? Why do you have to be so damn irresistible? Guys don't say that to guys, Cesar. Especially when they're naked. Then come get your robe. You are in deep doo-doo, pal. You're fucking strong. Damn straight. Don't pull any fast ones, se√±or. (moaning) Brenda. Baby, don't go. I told you, sweetie. I got to meet Daddy on campus tomorrow at 7. Are you dating me, or your Daddy? Be patient. You fuck so good! You sure have a way with words. You're gonna hurry back, promise? Me and the girls will be here Friday. But I'm not sharing you, you hear? (laughing) Can I stay the night? Someone's going to see you. So what? Just this one time - and don't you go blabbing around about this. You're hotter than a billy goat in a pepper patch. You're making fun of me. Never. Night. Cesar? I'm in bed with a homosexual. (knocking on door) Come in, (door opening) Morning. Courtesy of the dorm cafeteria. It's the thought that counts. Thank you...I'm starving. Just like Granny used to make them. You always rise and shine this early? Only if I'm really, really up for it. Speaking of up... You fixin' to get me into more trouble? Tonight. Got to go... Missed a tutoring appointment last night, so I have to go make it up. Look both ways before you leave. I'll just tell them you're one of my students. That's true, right? Wow. If he were a girl, I'd be riding a gravy train with biscuit wheels. Hey, cum guzzler! Jesus! You heard of knocking? Who put a bug up your ass? No one. You look guilty about something. I was studying all night. Do you mind?! I knew it! I can smell the pussy a mile away. You dog! You hound dog! Tell me all about it! Was it Camille? It was Camille, wasn't it? Is there a hole in the bed? Oh my God! Get out of here! You're crazy! Come on, we're gonna go play hoops. Be right there. In comparing Willa Cather to Edgar Allen Poe, we must first examine their relationship to the reader as seen through the... Are you high? No...I'm fine, Who is he? No one. I'm just in a good mood, that's all. What's your favorite song of all time? Don't laugh. "Sailing." Christopher Cross. I love that song. - Get out of here. - I'm serious. - Want me to sing it for yow? - No. No. No. No. No. I believe you. I used to play it on my boom box all the time, tending cattle. It made me feel there was this world of possibilities out there for me. But you're a smart guy, Cesar. You can do anything you set your mind to. No. Yes. Wish you tutored in accounting, too. You should be an art major. That's not practical, man. You care about being practical too much. And you're stubborn as an ox. Did you mean it when you said I'm the coolest person you've met here? Or was that just bullshit? That was just bullshit. Of course I meant it. Just didn't want you gettin' ideas, is all. What ideas? You know - ideas. Danny... Take your coat off. Stay awhile. Want a beer? When is Kevin getting here? Well - I'm still working on him. Steve! After all this trouble? Mellow out, Danny. I'm doin' my best here. Well, what did he say? Nothing. But I got a hunch... I think our Kevie boy may be falling in love. Close your eyes. What does it matter? They're already covered shut. Are they closed? Yeah. If you're pulling my leg, you will pay. Keep them closed. And no peeking. You were warned. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. I gotta be somewhere, OK? Kevin! Yee-hah! A wise choice, my friend. Should be there in a few hours. What's wrong with you? You sound like you just ran the 880 relay. I'm rushing to beat the weather. You hear about those storms coming? What's a little rain? It's gonna be a weekend we never forget. I'm counting on it. Did I tell you how stacked Susannah was? Three times. Hurry, dude. Girls are gonna be... Yeah! What changed his mind? What else? Snatch! It's good to be out in the open. Gives me perspective. Need to take some time away to get my thoughts together But I need to go right now so I can make it past the weather Storm is coming round the bend and I'm looking for the sun Cause nothin' makes no sense right now and it's time for me to run Ooooooh Truth is, Cesar's a great guy, a true friend. I mean, just cause he Kind of tricked me into all this doesn't mean he's a bad person. More than anything now, I need to be with my kind of people. Get things straightened out. Anybody home? Hello? - You made it! - Hey, bud! What's up! Mua! Get the hell off me! - You love it. - In your wet dreams. - Hi, Kevin! - Hey, Danny! It's Daniel now. Daniel? Don't let Mr. Preppie Pants fool you, he's still our Danny boy. I'm not a preppie. And I'm not naked. Can't wait to meet this Carla girl of yours, Danny. Uhh, Daniel. We've been going together two months. Cool. From the pictures Steve sent, it looks like you both got foxes. Oh yeah! With any luck this weekend, big Danny boy's going to lose his V. Fuck you! It's already happened. Yeah. Right. Get him under control, would you? I got some cooking to do. I'm glad you made it, man. Brings back a lot of memories. I hope you are ready for Susannah. You have no idea. You got to check out my new zebra bedspread, man. It's awesome. Bet the chicks love it. Oh yeah! Brenda went ape fuckin' orgasmic on the thing the other night... That girl - she knows how to turn it on! Would you put something on, dude? Yeah. How's that? You're too much. I don't know what it is, Kevin... Something about you brings out my frisky side. Why you putting those tapes away? The first rule when girls come over.. You gotta de-porn the premises. "Cindy Does SINcinnati" turned out handy. Cindy never disappoints. He's still got a bod - not that I'm thinking about it. What's on your mind, man? Nothing. Now don't bullshit a bullshitter. I'm not bullshitting you. You know I'll find out. (laughing) Oh remember.. Remember when we were in junior high school, and Kevin started that Playboy club? That was a whole lot of nothin'. He used to have all the boys come over, and we'd have to jerk off so that we could see the centerfolds. Did you really do that, or is he just making that up? Don't listen to him. He's always running his mouth. Danny, you were there. Oh no, that's right. You weren't cause you were too much of a pussy to join. Not all of us were sex maniacs. Danny. You didn't even know what jerking off was. I just learned by myself, like regular people do. What's with you? Kevin? What are you playing with there? Nothing. Did you buy Susannah a necklace? Ain't that sweet? Let me see it. Give me a break. Oh, I see... I think Kevin here is getting some back at the dorm and not letting on. What you think, Danny? I think you're right. (laughs) Come on man. (laughter fades out) What in tarnation possessed me to bring this thing? Well, at least he left a note... Better than dumping you mid-blow-job like that asshole at Sigma Nu. I need to get laid. Now. No, baby-cakes. What you need to do is stop forcing things. Chasing unavailable men is not good for your mental health. Fine...Will you marry me? I would... But you're a total fag, and I'm a total bitch. We just couldn't get our children into the good schools. 48... 49.., Girls set to go? Oh yep. They're leaving first thing in the morning. And don't blow your wad tonight. Susannah's gonna need a fill-up. I'll do my best. (thunder crashing) It's great to feel like one of the guys again. (thunder crashing) Sorry, Susannah. Wake up, ladies. There's been a change in plans. Now you all aren't going to believe this. Half of Texas flooded away last night. What? Danny, he's yanking our chain. No! All the roads up into here just washed away. - Are you serious? - That's impossible. Go check the news then. They did say the rivers were cresting. Uh, huh. They had record rains this fall. Uh, huh. This can't be happening. Hold it. If the roads are washed out, does that mean we're trapped here? Uh, huh. What about the girls? What about the food? Fuck the food! What about the girls? Well, they're safe at home, but... Looks like we're on our own for the weekend. (door knocking) Howdy. What do you want? Hell of a storm last night, huh? Uh, huh. It usually don't happen this time of year. If you're looking for Kevin, he's high-tailed it out of here. I wasn't looking for Kevin, shit for brains. I was looking for you. Could we go someplace else? What? Anyone could just walk in here. I'm confused. Kevin's room is empty. It's 10 a.m. You're almost as bad as Danny. Yeah, yeah. What are we going to do with ourselves all weekend? I am so fuckin' bored. I'm gonna go hunt us some food. Well, if it ain't Davy fuckin' Crockett. Guess what, Steve? If there was food in the fridge, I wouldn't have to resort to this. All right, Danny. Let's not get our panties in a wad. We need to be staying on higher ground. Yeah. OK. Al right. Bye. I worry about that boy sometimes. He's a little... Maybe we should help him. Nah. He'll be fine. Besides - this gives us a golden opportunity. What you mean? "Dixie Does Dallas" - the long, long awaited sequel to "Cindy Does SINcinatti." I don't feel comfortable in this room. He ain't going to mind if we're here. I'm feeding his faggy plants. What's he doing? Chasing pussy. What exactly do you want? To pass English. Can you get me a Coke? (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) Steve! (phone ringing) I'm in here taking a dump. Would you get it? (phone ringing) Hello. Thanks for blowing me off with that chicken-shit note. Cesar - hi. Don't "hi" me, closet whore, How did you get this number? Don't avoid the issue. I need my ring back. You'll get it. But - can't we still be friends? I don't take this shit from friends. (toilet flushing) I'm sorry - we just want different things out of life. Don't be mad. How's that pussy working out for you? Huh? I want my ring back. (phone hanging up) Girl trouble? Sort of. A good wank will help you forget. I do need to forget, that's for sure. I hope you jerk-offs worked up an appetite. I shot a turkey! Why's it called "My Antonio"? It's "My Antonia." You just get off on teaching, don't you? Maybe. Your essay needs to focus on point of view. It starts out in the voice of Antonia's childhood friend, who's a man. Now we may be seeing through his eyes... But the main character is... Antonia. You're not serious about this. Tam. My old man will fuckin' skin me alive if I don't pass this class. Then what are you doing? I was kind of hoping... You could write the paper yourself. Help me impress your girl pal, too. Fuck you. You really outdone yourself, boy. You really outdone yourself, boy. Eat up, dude. Those frat boys really taught you how to cook. Hey. Why don't you have a beer? He's right. You earned it. Oh, I forgot. Danny boy can't hold his liquor. Daniel. Well, I'll be dipped in shit. Do my Lone Star eyes deceive me? I told you, I've changed. Alright alright. I propose a toast... To Texas football. Eating pussy. And to drinking beer with Danny, all night long. (bottles clank) (dishes clanking) Don't strain yourself with the dishes. I got to save up my energy - for Dixie. Are you really drunk, or just that homy? You've got to check out that mechanical bull scene. That girl on girl action. Don't tell me that's not hot. Danny's right in the next room. That boy's so plastered unconscious, he could sleep through a tornado. Thanks to you. Since when do you turn down a night with Dixie? This ain't high school anymore. Best years of our lives, dude. Best years of our lives. Where you going? To get us some reinforcements. (moaning sounds from TV) Go! Dixie! Go! Yeah! Look at those titties! Oh yeah! Help me out! I want to shoot so hard, it hit the window! Come on! It would be rude not to help out a friend in need. This one's for Dixie. Oh yeah! Yeah! Slower. Faster. This is what normal, red-blooded American boys do, right? Why can't Cesar see that? OHHHHH! (cows mooing) Mom? Sounds like you were having a nightmare. I'm so hung over. Figures. You had two whole beers last night. Did I miss anything? Nah. Good morning to you. Don't leave when I'm trying to talk to you. That really pisses me off. This is a fag-free zone, remember? Sit the fuck down. Look, I have been reading this shit all night. And it don't make one lick of sense to me. You're wasting your time. What I gotta do to change your mind? Bathroom's yours. Drinking again? Where's Danny? Out chopping wood. Could you do me a favor? My Dad would have beat the shit out of me if I was queer. Don't keep saying words like that! It bugs me. This is the type of shit you pulled at Sigma Nu, isn't it? If everyone thinks that, it must be true. What would Kevin think about you doing this, huh? Like I give a shit what Kevin thinks. Then why you start acting like a greased pig every time his name comes up? Would you shut your trap about Kevin? We ain't got till Christmas. Oh my God! Oh! The message is clear. I need to find me a steady gal. Oh Lord! You're better than Brenda. Holy shit! Hi, Danny. I told you, it's Daniel. Five typed pages. Double spaced. Draw, faggot. Who said anything about drawing? This is getting kind of queer, guys. You calling me a queer, Danny boy? No. All I'm asking... What were you doin' under the covers, Kev? Here it is! I thought you put it under the covers. I told you it was there! I told him it was there. We was just fixin' to watch Dixie take on the football team... Not that you'd have any interest or clue about things like that. Why do you keep doing this stuff behind my back... Not including me? Well. Because you're repressed. I am not repressed. Repressed. Fine. I'll show you repressed. Bring it on, Dixie! This is really getting... Gay. You wanna blow me, is that what you want? That's worth two pages. Maybe. No - get the fuck away from me. I'd rather flunk. Fair enough. Wait. OK... But I'm pitching. You ain't doin' shit to me. Unless it's a blow job. Get dressed. This is some fucked-up shit. Quiet. I'm trying to concentrate on Dixie. What are you doing? Don't want the sheets to get messed up. Danny - will you assist me for a minute? No way! OK. I was just kidding. Go, Dixie! Yeah, baby! Ride me! Ride me! Woo! You're a lot bigger than I remember, Danny. - Really? - Yeah. I'm getting close. No. No. No. We gotta synchronize. Ready? One... Two... Three. Go! Oh! Oh! I brought groceries. Aaah! I'm sorry. I really am... Let's get this over with, all right? Come on. I'll help you, but you have to write the paper yourself. I got butt naked for you, dick breath. You owe me. I could have had you... But I never really would have had you. What the fuck does that mean? I've heard of guys night out, but come on. Brenda. Baby. We were just watching some porn. Well, I'm glad to know it's not a job. Please don't tell Carla about any of this. Whose idea was this? How'd you get here, hon? Four-whee! drive. And I gotta be back tonight, so start explain'. Dixie here was our only company, mam. Can you toss me my sweats? I don't feel very well. Baby, come on. Let me make it up to you. Oh, geez. I give up. You can fake the frat boys out of the frat... But you can't take the frat out the boys. Brenda... (thud) You tell anybody about this... I'll beat the shit out of you. That's not going to help you pass English, tough guy. Not Willa Cather. I think I'd rather get fucked in the ass. Where were we? Yeah! Just like that! Oh! I reckon they made up. Why you putting the scouring powder in the fridge? Shit. I really wasn't into it. You know? What are you talking about? Pass me the turkey leftovers, would you? Damn it! Danny, guys do this stuff all the time. It don't mean nothin'. They do? Sure. Even guys with girlfriends. Especially guys with girlfriends. I can't write this paper. Yes, you can. You really going to help me? Yeah. Justin... Stay. Just gonna go get us some chow. I see an all-nighter ahead. You're in love with someone back at school, aren't you? What? Hell, no. Sounds serious. Danny - I'm not in love. It's impossible, OK?! I'm just asking. I don't know, man. I've been trying to forget about things all weekend. Then Susannah doesn't show up. What are you talking about? There's no future in it, Danny. It can't work! I'm very confused. I wouldn't be happy. I couldn't be happy. I want to get married! Have kids and all. You know? Uh, huh. Maybe I should check on Cesar... Make sure he hasn't gone off the deep end. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi, Kevin, Cesar. It's really great to hear your voice. Me, too. Sorry about being angry the last time we spoke. No, it's OK. I didn't even ask you how you did in the storm,. We're all safe and sound. Thanks. Are you all right? It's been... Kevin, it's been a totally crazy week. A totally crazy weekend. You're telling me. I don't think we should see each other when you get back. OK. What I'm trying to say is... I don't know what I'm trying to say. I understand. Kevin? Are you there? Yeah. I better go. We're still friends, right? When I get back, there's this really cool burger place I can take you to. I wish you only good things, Kevin. Cesar... I'll leave money for the long-distance bill. The what? Bye, Kevin. (phone hanging up) Bye. Hey, man! How'd it go with Brenda? She's fine. She left. Had to get back to her daddy. Again. What's up with you, man? Does it have anything to do with that necklace? No! It's got absolutely nothing to do with that goddamn necklace. Nothing! Things have a way of working themselves out, man. They always do. Yeah. You have got to put in a good word for Marsha, dude. I'll tell her you have a beautiful penis. Well, as you now know, I don't get no complaints in that department. Listen to him. You missed a once-in-a-lifetime chance there, cowboy. Cowboy? I'm not your cowboy. Aggressive, I like it. Let me put some Dixie on for us. Screw Dixie, Yes, sir. Drain my pipe, sir What the fuck?!! Jesus, Kevin! Have you lost your fuckin' mind? - I lost it. - Fuck! I'm drunk. I ain't... I ain't that way, Kevin. Neither am I. Fuck off! I know what you're accusing me of. Relay, dude. I ain't accusin' you of nothin'. Look, you and me - we're the same. No, bud - we're not. You started all of this! It was you! You got a burr in your saddle about something. Listen. You and I... We're friends. We will always be friends. But... Night. Everything all right? Everything's great. Just great. Hey, studious one. Hey! What's going on? What is wrong with this picture? I haven't properly introduced you to my new friend, Justin. Nice seeing you again, Marsha. Just so you know, I graduated in the top 90 percent of my class. That high? I knew you'd be impressed. Danny! Let's go! Maybe we can come up for the SMU game. That would be cool. Don't let him drink and drive, Daniel. I won't. Take your time getting back, too. The roads are still a mess. I hope... Everything works out for you back at school. Thanks. For the first time in my life... The truth was staring me right in the face. I'm... Delusional. Hi. Hi. This suitcase is really heavy. I could really use some help Taking it back to my room. There's a dolly out in the hallway. Yeah. Thanks. I'm sorry... For what I did. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you. OK. But I need my ring back, Kevin. Yeah. See you. You too. Cesar... You were right all along. I'm a mess. Wait a second... I never said you were a mess. A delusional closet whore, maybe. But never a mess. Thanks for clarifying that. Just wanted to set the record straight. At least there's one thing I'm not confused about. And what's that? You're special to me. And even though I tried everything Yo forget that... I couldn't. What am I going to do with you? You're a smart guy... You'll figure something out. I just want to know if we're... Possible. I wish I could tell you I'm not fucked up anymore... That I've got it all figured out. But - it's Morning in America. And I'm having myself one lucky day.
