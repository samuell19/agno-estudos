You don't need to know much to know who I am. Maybe two or three things. Like my age, my name, where I was born, or what my parents do. That said... No, what you should know is that I wasn't prepared. Thanks a lot. Early April. I'm back. I left three months ago. Say, you're back early. I got robbed. Got any money left? Not really, no. -So you know what to do. -Yeah. Find a job? I told you: bumming around is great for hippies. For who? Hippies. Hippies aren't a thing anymore, Dad. What's with the earring? I told him it wouldn't work, and I knew you wouldn't get along with him. Because... No, he's too... Oh, honey! -How are you? -Good, and you, Mom? -What are you doing here? -I'm back. Let me call you back, Christine. Kevin's here. Yes, I know. -Hi! Can I make you some coffee? -Sure, sure. -Did you see your father? -Yeah. He commented on my earring. I think it looks good. So how come you're back so soon? I had a problem. FALLING FOR LOVE TEMP AGENCY It's not open? Oh, right. -Hello. -Hi. Sorry about the door. Today's my first day. Oh? Well, it's not my first day here. I'll look you up, then. -My name is Kevin Morrin. -OK. Morrin with two "R"s. R-R. Last time, I worked at Mido's, by the... Yeah, hang on, I'm looking at it. I can start today. Right away, even. -Right now? -Yeah. OK. So, I have an industrial farm... Yeah? What do they do? They do... Pigs. I mean, they raise hogs. OK. -Yeah? -Yeah. -What's your name? -Kevin. OK, Kevin. There are three buildings with two rooms each, and 200 hogs per room. OK? They get here at 2 months; they weigh 55 pounds. They leave 6 months later weighing 220 pounds on the hoof. 194 pounds slaughtered. I'll show you one of the rooms. What do you do here? -Open the door. -No. You turn on the lights. Go look through the window. -So you don't scare them. -It's lit up. Great. Now you go in. -Two visits a day. -OK. Holy shit... What are you doing? Come here. You'll get used to it, OK? You make sure there's no water leaking. Make sure the food's coming out. If there's a problem, I'll show you how to fix it with a screwdriver. -It's easy. OK? -OK. The humidity of the room is very important. If it gets damp, tell me. That means there's a ventilation problem. -OK. -That's very, very important. Last thing: Don't look them in the eyes. Why? They're smart little fuckers. They'll guilt-trip you. Lights. Let's introduce you. Romane! -Romane. -Yeah? This is Kevin. Kevin, Romane. Romane, Kevin. -Hello. -Hi. Show him the sheep. OK. Give me two seconds to finish up. I'm not introducing you. You're fired. What the hell! Why? Tell me why! So your job is to feed them. So you put hay on this side and that side. Twice a day, you also need to put three buckets -of food in the feeders. -Will you show me how? Yes. But you have to learn fast. The boss is pretty tough. You haven't told us anything. How was it? Like a first day. Where do you work? -You didn't tell him? -No. At Bouvier's. How is it? Not too hard? It stinks. Last time, it was the plastic. Your problem isn't with smells. It's with work. Very funny. It really does stink there. Well, when you've had enough, there's always a spot for you. Stop, Dad. We already tried. We can't work together. That's not true. It's that you don't want to. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Yield right, for fuck's sake! Open up! Are you OK? I'm all right. I'm not hurt. Is your bike OK? If it needs any repairs, come see me, and we'll work it out. I'm Alice. I'm here every day. You smell bad. That's 'cause... Never mind. OK. Well, see ya. Yeah. AUTO BODY What happened, dude? -Load her up? -Yeah. You can borrow my Kawasaki for now. Kevin? Yeah, yeah. What are you looking at? I just met this chick... Clearly. Show me. How old is she? I don't know. Don't care. She's pretty, right? -Seriously, how old is she? -I don't know. I'd say... Around 25. -Wow. -Wow what? When we were in 5th grade, she was in 9th grade. 284 bucks! And he's giving me a deal! Can you stop for two minutes so we can just eat? You haven't given it a rest for 4 hours. You don't even have a license! If you hurt him, we'd be in debt the rest of our lives! Jesus Christ. Enough already! All you think about is money. It's always money, money, money! We don't have any fucking money! You've changed, Jean. You know that? You've changed. You know what? If you're not happy, the door's wide open. If it weren't for your horses, I'd be long gone. Oh yeah? To where? Your grandma's? Laugh. That's all you're good for. Everything you know how to do I taught you. Oh, this again! It's the truth. I know what you really want. For me to leave in an ambulance, like the Belgian. That'd be nice. Bullshit. Fuck you. Don't even think about coming to my room! 20 seconds left! Up quick! Let's see it! Grab the sleeves, guys. That's not bad. Grab those sleeves! Mate! All right. Bow. Change partners. Quick, quick. Bow, and hajime! All right. Don't forget the sleeves. Keep it moving. That's not bad. Seiza! Rei! Hey guys, anyone got some cream for my shoulder? Yeah, here. So, Kevin, how was Barcelona? Awesome. You want a bite to eat at midnight, you go out, no problem. Everything's open. And the babes? Same thing. Everything's open. You see that little smile? So you had a good time. -Yeah, but I was mostly working. -Fred? -Yeah? -Meet at your place? Yeah. Not before 9, though. OK. -Hey! Bring something to drink. -Yeah. What are you waiting for? If you like her, go for it! I don't know... Did she smile at you or not? I'm talking to you! Yes, she smiled at me! Then go for it! I said, I don't know. I'm too nervous to talk to her. Let's start over. Sit down. When she smiled at you... -Yeah? -Could you see her teeth? -What? -When she smiled at you, was there teeth? Are you stupid? Of course I saw her teeth. -Are you fucking with me? -This isn't a joke. Not all are real. There's the timid, awkward smile, and the open, honest one. That one. The honest one. -Like that? -No, but she smiled. Like this? Not like that, but she... -Show me what she did. -She... Like that? Yeah, like this. -Oh, jeez... -What? Like that? Frozen? No, not frozen. She was crying in her car, -and... -She was crying? -Yeah. But... -She saw you and cried? -No, she was crying... -Because of you? She was crying because of the accident, and then at the end, when she said goodbye, she smiled at me. But the open, honest kind. With all her teeth. NEW MESSAGE CAN'T COME IN TODAY 101 DEGREE FEVER. SORRY. You're nuts! You don't know how to ride. But I know how to fall. That's what matters. I'll practice. What'd she say? If she's stupid enough to encourage you, I'd watch out. No, they're going to need someone. The guy's leaving soon. -The Australian? -No, the other one. Alice told me he's jittery. What I like about this job is that it takes balls. Or a lack of brains. Or being in love. Grandma... He's too young. Well, after one who's too old, you deserve one who's too young. Quit it with that. -I'm going. -Already? Yeah, I stole the car. You're still driving without a license? Are you crazy? -I want him to pay for it. -But don't you realize... -I wish you'd visit more often! -Stop it? -I can pay for your license. -No, he should have to do it! He does whatever he wants, so he should get me gift. You're stubborn, you know. Yep! Like Mom. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, stop! Touch the wall and come back. Did you see the pic Julie just posted? -Yeah. -Yeah. And Nico got hired at Carrefour, too. Yeah, his brother got him the job. -Holy shit! -What? Nude pic of Samantha. No! -Seriously? -You guys are fucking obsessed! -Seriously? -You fucking asshole. -Anyway... -What up, Fred? -You out? -Gonna smoke a cig. None of us is ever gonna see her naked. You don't know. Maybe by accident... Don't joke; you don't know what she said to me about you. What? THE AMBUSH -Got a light? -Yeah? Can I ask you something? Yeah. I saw a horse at your place. -Is it yours? -No, it's my sister's. OK. Can I ask your sister something? Well, she's in Amiens. What for? She's studying to be a nurse. OK Man, what's wrong with your car? You drive like shit. This car kinda sucks, huh? Are we hear to talk about cars or horses? Yeah, sorry. -Horses. -All right, then. Here. Royal, Kevin. Kevin, Royal. -Can I pet him? -Yeah, go ahead. Hey. Easy. In the back. -Can you get me the other buckles? -Yeah. Kevin, the door! One fuck-up after another, today, Kevin! -Run! Grab them, for fuck's sake! -I can't catch them! How many times have I told you to close that goddamn door? Unbelievable! You're doing it on purpose, huh? I'm trying to get him out. Can't you see he's stuck? Grab him! How stupid can you be? What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey! Where are you going? No, you fix the mess you made right this minute, kid! You're gonna have to stop that. Stop talking to me like that, OK? I'll talk to you however I please, got it? I give the orders and you obey. That's how this works. So fix your mistake, right now! Don't fuck with me, Kevin. I'm warning you. Kevin, your food's getting cold! What are you doing? -Why don't you go? -I'll take care of it. It's been a month and a half. Usually one month is more than enough. What are you doing? It's cold. Put a sweater on if you're cold. You can't turn it up a little... I set it to 68. That's fine, right? I can't afford to get sick. Me neither, and no one else. I'm going to sleep at Julius's. Kevin, you're staying here. This is too much, Patrick. -Julius? -I'm upstairs. Kevin's here, Dad. Hello, Simon. Careful. I'll leave the light on in the hallway, OK? Goodnight, Dad. Is it cool if I stay here tonight? Of course, dude. -He's not better? -He'll never get better. It's not gonna improve. I'm sorry. For what? It's not your fault. -Want something to drink? -Yeah. I got fired. Oh, shit! What happened? I fucked up. I always said you've got a shitty attitude.

I was on Royal, galloping. Normal galloping. -OK. -Normal. And I let one hand off. Like this. Clean. I tried to lift the other one... -That must be nice. -What? -It must be nice. -Ever seen two hands? -Two hands off? -Yeah. Well, no... So I had no hands on, and I decided to take one foot out, too. -So I take my foot out, like this... -Be careful. So I have my hand off, and I started going like this... -In slow-mo? -No, no. Can you give me some food? So I was on Royal... -You want more sauce? -Well, yeah! Royal. Hey, Karim. Hey. Do the tally. You're pathetic. Oh yeah! Let's go. Let's go. Kevin? Wake up.

Hey, Kevin. -You didn't show up on Thursday. -Yeah. -I started riding horses. -What? -What about judo? -I don't have much time. You're kidding. -We have a competition on the 15th. -Yeah, I know. I was gonna come tell you. I can't make it. -Are you kidding? -No. You realize you're screwing us over? We'll be penalized if you don't show. It's not like I'm the best. True, you're not the best. What's this about? A girl? No! You only think about yourself. -Not true. -Yes, it is. Get outta here. Good session, huh? All you do is eat. You see when I did no hands? Who said you could use my horse? Who are you? Fred said I could... It's not his horse! -Since when do use something that... -It's not a thing. Don't get cute. I know what it is, and it doesn't belong to you. -OK, well, I got him shoed. -So? I repainted my apartment... I still pay rent. How is that relevant? And my saddle! What let you use my saddle?! -I told you, Fred... -I don't give a shit! Ask me before using my things! You know what I went through to get all this? No! Plus, you mixed up the saddle cloth... Hang on. You know what? Take your horse back. Sucks for him, though! The training was good for him. Hey. Come here. -What? -Come on. There's something that'd be good for me, too. What's that? I'm Mariam. -Kevin. -I have some free time right now. Come with me? Come on. But, uh... Don't worry. I'm not here often. Zappa. Galop. There. Not bad. -You know the terms? -No. -500. -500? -Are you kidding? -No. You'll never find someone at that rate. Next. -You hear the terms? -No. 500. Next. "There's an opening sooner than expected.

I love it when you're supportive. What about you, Simon? Here. Thanks. Who are you texting? Nobody. Right. Like I'm an idiot. 'Cause if you're gonna text her, show me first. Is that a sex thing? No, what are you talking about? Sorry, but... It's super vague. "Ride." Ride what? Horses. OK, well, then you should be more specific. -It's not obvious? -No, not at all. -You didn't get it? -No... I'd have put... I don't know... Oh, fuck. -What? -I sent it. No! It's these touch screens... Fuck! I'm sorry. Fuck! It's unclear? Really unclear. Just wait. Besides, maybe she'll get it. Horses are her thing. -It's her field. -Yeah. Or maybe not. Jesus Christ. It's not unclear: "I can show you how I ride." Dude, of course it's unclear. "OK." OK what? "OK, good timing." Nice. You really don't understand women at all. You're one to talk. Yeah, hang on. -Hello? -Why didn't you answer? You've been calling all the time! I'm at work. I gotta go. Hang on. I'm at home.

You'll have room and board, and I'll take care of insurance. Great. What'd I do with it? Here. Sign down here. I'll fill it in later. -But don't skimp on the hours. -Of course not. I think we'll get along! -Thanks. -You can go meet Alice. -She'll show you your room. -OK. -It's here? -Yeah. There's a kitchen, but we usually have dinner together. OK. Do you like it? Yeah! So you start tomorrow? Yeah. What? Nothing. Don't start dreaming. You're here to work, OK? Christ, that really killed me. "Don't start dreaming." What'd you say? Nothing. What was I supposed to say?

But I'm getting paid here. -She's the girl? -Why are you here? We haven't heard from you, so I went to see Julius. -She's worried, too. -Christ. What's all this about being an acrobat? -That's gonna be your life? -What did Julius say? I told you. She's worried, like us. You know what? I don't care. This is what I want. And in case you care, I like doing this. You're gonna pay a high price for those idiot dreams of yours. -Everything all right? -Yeah. Back to it? Lie back. Gallop. I couldn't tell him nothing. He's your dad. You shouldn't have mentioned Alice! Take it easy. You could have warned me! -I didn't have time. -No time? No, I didn't have time. Right. Look, I'm outta here. Watch out, Kevin. You're losing your friends. Friendship's not my priority right now. Excuse me? That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. Go fuck yourself. -Julius, come on. -Get out. Can't you see I'm working? Beat it.

I have a meeting at city hall Tuesday. Can't you postpone it? I can't postpone city hall to drive you into town. I can take her. Thanks. -Have a nice day. -Thanks. It's your fault I stalled. What did I do? I don't like being watched. I'm sorry. Shall we? Kevin, you gotta stop staring at me. It's not on purpose. I'm saying that for you. OK. I'll buy some dark glasses. What? So you won't see my eyes. Shut up. Sit up, there. You don't match the horse. How can you get on looking at your feet? -Hang on longer. -But I wasn't... -And you're up. -That's why I lost my balance. Tiptoes. This won't work, Mel. It needs more work. Put the other one on. That's good. There, he's with you. See? That's starting to work. Keep it up. You're on the right track. Put on Kevin? Not bad. That's not bad, but don't forget to breathe. Same thing here. Remember to breathe. Stop. That's something. You were right. Not bad. You've got work. But theres something to do. You've still got work to do. Yeah. But it's not bad. But it needs work. -Lots of work. -OK. Sorry, man, I have to talk to that girl. What do you want? Can we make up? I don't think so. What can I do to... You dropped your friend for a girl. How can I forgive you? I messed up. Yeah, you did. Now you gotta pay for it. Mariam's saying you used her. That's not true. Fred said he's going to kick your ass. What's up? Did you two fight? Isn't it obvious? Mel? So, how'd it go? -Good, yeah. -Yeah? What's that mean? We reached ana greement. Awesome! Tell me. You're going to put on a show for his supporters before his speech. Are you kidding? No, not really. Goddamnit, Jean. Let me explain. I told you already, I'm not working for that asshole. I need that asshole. Well that's none of my fucking business! Think of someone else for once in your life! That's completely irrelevant. But I agreed to this! Then you should have asked me first. I'm not ready. Who cares? You think they know about that stuff? All they want to see is your ass out there! Excuse me? My what? Chill out, you know what I mean. Fucking bastard! Jesus Christ, Alice! Alice! -Everything all right, Jean? -Shut up. You OK? I'm here. Hey. How are you? All right. Got time for coffee? -Right now? -Yeah. I have a meeting kinda soon. And your girl? No. -What, "no"? -I'm not talking about that with you. Oh? Well, I'll tell your mother I saw you. Hello? -You hear about Julius? -No. What's going on? Her father died. What? Just like that? Did you talk to Julius? No, I just heard at the bakery. You were the last person to make him laugh. Thanks. Are you leaving? Let's step outside and end this, Kevin. -You sure? -Yeah. That way it'll be over. Is this really the day? I can't help that. I promised my sister. Let's go. You gonna be all right, Kevin? I have no choice. Hang on. Sorry, man, but this doesn't concern you. It's over already? What? Did you want more of a show? I don't know... Isn't that your job now? Come on, let's get a drink. Happy birthday. You get some cool presents? What did you get? That's very nice. It's terrible, but I think it's better this way. I mean, he's better off, right? I don't know. No, you're right. I don't know. I feel bad for thinking like this. Stop it, Julius. You were great with your dad. How's it going, Mel? I'm going home. Where? Australia? Yeah. Just like that? I've been away a long time. Why are going back now? I miss my family. -Are you serious? -Yes. It's gonna be strange without you. We just met, and now you're leaving? Why don't you all come with me? -Are you drunk? -No. Hey! You think you're the first? First what? You know exactly what I'm talking about. Don't test me, asshole. Understand? It wasn't about you. I'm sorry, sir. What do you think? She doesn't give a shit about you. I think she does. You're that naive? Alice is a flirt. She toys with guys. I let her play around; then I say stop. And now I'm saying "stop." You get me? So get the hell out. Get out! -What are you doing? -I got fired. -Why? -He knows about me and Alice. -Ah, damn. -Yeah. Here, take these. I'll come back for my things. You're leaving with him? Jean... Explain. I don't understand. Stop. Alice... Alice. The school's just back there, and there's the grocery store at the corner. Large living room. Windows on two sides, which is rare for a one-bedroom. Fully-equipped kitchen. Lots of light. Everything's been repainted. It's not a great neighborhood. Well, given the rent... Utilities are included? Yes. You won't find anything better for 430 euros. Do you like? Obviously I like it. Let's do it? Alice, look. Are you kidding? You don't like it? -No. -Isn't it nice? -It's disgusting, Kevin. -"Disgusting"? Let's not exaggerate. It's not disgusting. Hang on... you really like this thing? -You'd put this in your place? -Yeah. How can anyone have such bad taste? Clearly they sell them. That's not a good reason. I love you, so I must have good taste. A minimum of good taste. -Did you like my flowers? -Yes. I picked them on the road. With my own two hands. -What kind of flowers are they? -Iris. Hey, that rhymes with Alice. See, love? Your name and my life fit like puzzle pieces. You seem happy that he's here. Of course I'm happy. May I remind you that he got fired? You're turning into a grumpy old man, Patrick. Can't you see how happy he is? Isn't it nice? All right, all right... He's my son, too, you know. If you must know, I'm afraid for him. He's gonna get hurt. Why are you always so negative? He's in love. That's wonderful. Yeah. You're right. I'm turning into an asshole. Thank you, honey. Give me your plate. What are you planning on doing now? We put together an act. You think he's good enough? Of course I am. I was asking the lady. She has a name, Dad. Her name is Alice. Would you two cut it out? Do you think you'll find another circus? Yeah, of course. Your son is talented, sir. He has a way with the horses. Is that so? Obviously not just with horses. I'm just teasing. To horses and those who ride them. No, we're not looking for anyone. We haven't even shown you anything. Look. I said we're not hiring. Come on, let's go. God damn it. -Did you know he knew Jean? -No. -He must have talked to him, right? -Presumably. What do we do? Do you know anyone else? Look, see for yourself. There's nothing. I really need work. Well, there's the pigs, but given how that wound up... I know. I fucked up, I know. What, you'd go back to that? -Yeah. -Really? -Well, I can give them a call. -Thanks. But given how things played out last time... Hello, sir. This is the temp agency. I'm good, how are you? Yeah, great. Yes, just fine, thanks. I'm here with Kevin Morrin. I don't know if you... OK, you remember him. Well, he... Yes, I know. Listen, though, sometimes... You know what? I'll put him on. I'll put him on. He's right here. Here. Hello? Hi. -Can I help? -No, that's OK, babe. I poured you a glass of wine. Thanks. Did you see the emails? The circus got a bad review. Yeah, I saw. What'd the Freds say? To call back in a year. -In a year? Seriously? -Yeah. Hey. -Stop. -Stop what? You're feeling low because you're exhausted. All these dark thoughts are taking advantage of that. But I won't let them. I'm gonna kill all your dark thoughts. Come on, love. As you can see, the track is only 30 feet long. For the Liberty show, we could do something, but there's no room for the acrobatics. Yeah, but we're together. -Romane, I'm gonna go for a smoke. -OK. OK. VOUS ME MANQUEZ, LES AMIS MEL What if we went? -You want to go to Australia? -Why not? There's work. I don't Mel's bullshitting us. Wouldn't it be great? What's keeping us here? Well, my grandma. We'll take her with us. She might like it. Let's talk to her about it Sunday. -Are you serious? -Yeah. No, but I... I was kidding, Kevin. She can't change her life at her age. And I can't leave her. You understand? Yeah. Are you mad? No. When you get back, the work'll be done, I promise. -Don't ask me. -Just once. -No. -One day. We spoke on the phone and agreed. But it's an audition. -Did we agree or not? -Yes, we did. End of discussion. For Christ's sake, please! It's important! Drop it. Fuck! Did you bring the DVD? I left it on the table. -I'll go. -OK. -Hello. -Hello. The train station. OK. -Can you wait two minutes, please? -Of course. Thank you. Here. You're so beautiful. Go, or you'll miss your train. I'll call you when I get there, OK? -Alice, right? -Yes. Here's my offer. If you want, you start tomorrow. But only you. Your friend's not good enough. You can't judge someone like that in five minutes! Listen, your friend is charming and full of enthusiasm, but he's not an acrobat. You know it. Kevin, say something. What about me? Where's that leave me? I'm sorry. Can you believe that? She actually said that. "I'm doing you a favor by leaving you." She wouldn't have made you happy. That's kind of an easy out. I know I'm bothering you. I'll go. No, stay the night here. No, I'm going home. Out of the question. Kevin. Come on. Help me make up the bed. Come on. I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU. COME SEE ME WHENEVER YOU WISH. MAKE SURE THE DOOR LOCKS WHEN YOU LEAVE. XOXO Grandma, I just stole 1,000 euros from you. From the cupboard. It's not what I was taught. Please forgive me. I'm going to Australia, thanks to you. I won't forget you. I won't forget you, and I promise you'll see that money again. Give Alice a hug for me. And tell her I don't blame her. Subtitling: Hiventy
