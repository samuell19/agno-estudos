NEAR SAPPORO, HOKKAIDO NASA, the US Space agency, says most of the meteoroids will burn up in a meteor shower, but some will be large enough to reach the Earth's surface. Their trajectory is northwest over the Pacific. It is thought that some could fall on northern Japan... Everyone! The field trip is canceled! Back on the bus! - Honami speaking. - It's me. Listen carefully. One just came down off the Sanriku Coast. At this rate, the next point is Hokkaido, very likely just outside Sapporo. None of them have hit Iand yet, so we don't know how big... Hello? What's that? It's huge! Get down! GAMERA 2: ATTACK OF LEGION Meteor strike southwest of Lake Shikotsu! Disaster Squad requested! Mount up! Sir! I'm Watarase, from the Chemistry Institute. I'm Hanatani. What's the status report? No radiation or chemical pollution detected. - See? You didn't need to come. - Orders are orders. There hasn't been time for any organic tests yet. - Have you recovered the meteor? - No, sir. - Can't you find it? - No, sir. The marks it Ieft almost Iook Iike it was slowing down when it hit. Slowing down? I don't like the sound of this. One of the meteorites has landed in Northern Japan, in a mountainous region 50kms south of Sapporo, Hokkaido. Many trees in the area have caught fire, but no human fatalities are reported. SAPPORO SCIENCE CENTER - What's that? - Well... You can still input, can't you? So there must be something wrong with the outside lines. Yeah, right... But I don't understand it. There's been problems all over the south side since morning. The south side? I went over there today, but we couldn't find the trouble. - Maybe it was the meteor shower? - No, too far away. Hello, Science Center. Can you tell me what that green glow is in the sky off to the south? Sorry, I can't hear you very well. Hello? Hey! Come outside and Iook! It's toward Lake Shikotsu. The ancient chronicles say that the sky once went red. In 1990, the upper red part of the northern lights was visible as far as Central Japan. But green? All I can guess is some kind of localized magnetospheric fluctuation. Even if the meteors are affecting the ionosphere, they wouldn't cause anything Iike this. Eh? A strong magnetic field around here might knock out all electronic devices. - I'll have a Iook around. - No, wait. This is a restricted area! Eh? Great! They never found anything from the Tunguska meteorite in Siberia. One theory is that it was nothing but ice. Looking at the data, it's hard to think that about this one. Maybe it moved somewhere else. "Moved"? Do meteorites move? No, of course they don't. - But... - But what? Would a whole cloud of meteoroids just happen to come straight at Earth? That bothers me. And the traces Iook like skid marks from braking. DAY 3 Here... HUGE METEORITE STRIKE? NO TRACES FOUND Is it true you used to be a detective in Nagasaki? Who told you that? Why did you quit? Something happened that scared me half to death. I decided I wasn't cut out for it. Where did that alarm come from? Come on, Osako! You used to be a cop! I wasn't cut out for it, I told you! But you were a pro, weren't you? So? You're a professional guard! I'm only part-time! Don't push! What is it? Damned if I know! NTT HOKKAIDO NETWORK OPERATION CENTER Someone's taking our fiber-optic cables. DAY 4 They're not damaged, they're gone. We don't know what's going on. The reports start at Eniwa and move gradually north. Eh? Takino, Tokiwa, Ishiyama... That's exactly what's happening. Is this something to do with those meteors? Wait! No portable phones near the computers. This way. Honami speaking. Hello, Watarase here. Sorry to bother you, but... 10,000 cases of beer? What a waste! Thanks for coming. Is this connected to that thing at Lake Shikotsu? You talked about it moving, so perhaps you can tell me. Got any ideas? - Well, the direction fits. - The direction? Something seems to be moving this way from Lake Shikotsu. Look, how many times do l have to tell you? Like a crab, like an insect... That's what l saw! A huge thing, big as a man. - You said it was just a shadow. - Yes, l did, but... You don't believe me, Officer. l saw it, l tell you! Why does this always have to happen to me? The police got to him before we had a chance. So, the police didn't believe him? Well, he used to be a police officer down in Nagasaki. His was the first report on Gyaos. Gyaos? You can see that they might be a bit wary. A lot of bottles smashed, and silicon powder left scattered around. The glass was chemically dissolved, and the beer was just left there. It's Iike the world is coming apart at the seams. First Gamera and Gyaos. And now creatures from outer space. Creatures from outer space, you reckon? Sixty percent of Tahiti's plant species were carried there by birds. The same thing could happen with planets. Not that I'm sure about all this. Well, if the seams are Ietting go, it's our job to sew them back up. DAY 5 ODORI SUBWAY STATION, SAPPORO What happened? Excuse me. Ishida? The north-south subway line is shut down at this moment. Hazardous material has been found. That's all we know right now. Halt! We see the train. Proceeding. What's that? It's coming this way! Fall back! All we know now is that police are working to rescue the passengers. Hazardous materials are causing fears for their safety. The atmosphere is tense around Odori Station. Something seems to be happening. The rescue crews are moving... What's wrong with the TV? They're here. What the hell? Operations! Operations! - ISDN circuits down! - Mobile communications off-Iine! What the hell's going on? - Well done, Officer. - Who are you? You haven't been told? No, has the Self-Defense Force been called out? Communications are all messed up. We're here to examine the tunnel. For what? It's in connection with our visitor from outer space. I should be doing this alone, not getting you guys into trouble. I don't consider this trouble. I'll have to report this, you know. Hang on. Look at this. Pressure four atmospheres? Oxygen seventy-eight percent? That's four times normal. - What's it Iike down there? - Take a guess. What are they? What we were Iooking for was some kind of germ. What we found is what you see. So they're an alien Iifeform? Colonel! There are survivors! - Get them! - Squad forward! You're going to be fine. Come on, hurry! Why would they just kill some? Why not all of them? There's got to be a common thread. Appearance, medical history, what they had on. The Governor has called us out. They want you at Headquarters. Oxygen is so vital a factor in our survival that it's easy to forget that in too high a concentration it's a poison. NORTHERN SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL'S OFFICE Prolonged exposure to such an environment brings a toxic reaction, coughing, sore throat and respiratory difficulties. In the high-pressure and oxygen conditions in that tunnel, most terrestrial Iifeforms would not survive for Iong. - Anything to add, Colonel Watarase? - Yes. Our enemy is a completely different lifeform. There is no possibility of co-existence. If we allow it to survive, we will die. For our own survival, we must ready ourselves to fight it to extinction. Have you ever heard of Ieaf-cutter ants? The ones that grow mushrooms around their nests? Yeah, the mushrooms won't grow there unless the ants feed them. Without the mushrooms, the ants can't maintain their nest. So the plant-thing in that building, the thing we're calling the pod... That thing with all the grass-Iike spikes around it? Yes, we assume it's connected with those alien lifeforms. We should probably consider them two aspects of the same thing. If that's true, we kill both by killing either one, won't we? - There's just one thing. - What's that? How does the pod reproduce? Colonel Watarase! - The pod's flowering. - Flowering? - What color? - I didn't ask. We're going to blow it up. The Self-Defense Force is about to attack the lifeforms discovered at Susukino Subway Station. Anyone within one mile of the station is to evacuate the area immediately. Citizens are asked to remain calm and follow all instructions. Testing, testing, over. In that much oxygen, a small explosion should kill them. That will limit the damage too. I'm amazed that the Roads Department is letting us do this. It'll just cost more in the Iong run if we let it go now. There's no other choice. That radio's no use. Leave it here. Bandits, 12 o'clock! - Evacuation proceeding. - Roger. Move right in, please! What's going to happen? Evacuation on schedule. Operation begins as planned at 20:00 hours. - Do we have radio contact? - No, sir. Any word from inside? We're not usually supposed to use the company computers like this. - How long till you're done? - Yes, ma'am! Coming right up! One estimate of maximum damage should the pod explode and launch a seed into space. They might've made their decision faster if we'd done this before. I wonder... I doubt they've considered that it might launch a seed into space. I'll admit it sounds strange, but how else would it move? Obitsu... how much damage? A 4-mile radius around downtown Sapporo would be destroyed for sure. The pod's activating. Damn! It's going to Iaunch! Let's get out of here! You ran the simulation. We can't outrun an explosion Iike that. SANRIKU COAST Five days since the meteor storm. Nothing unusual on Sanriku Coast. Returning to base. Bogey 90 degrees. 12,000 meters. Closing fast. SELF-DEFENSE FORCE WARSHIP "UMIGIRI" Have chopper confirm. Unidentified object at 8 o'clock, approaching fast. Establish visual contact. It'll be some dolphins. Seahawk? Come in! Seahawk! Come in! Confirm bogey as Gamera. Bearing northwest. Awaiting orders. Gamera? We think the pod is emitting pure oxygen. Attacking it might induce an explosion. - Waiting won't help. - But... The tunnel crew should try an attack. That might shut down the pod. - What about civilians? - Evacuation is complete. Confine the attack to the tunnel. Ready to fire! Fire! Radio up! Gamera sighted off Sanriku Coast. Bearing towards Hokkaido. Repeat. Gamera is flying towards Hokkaido. Go! Weapons at the ready! That's... Gamera. TANUKI STREET What's Gamera doing here? Operation suspended. Fall back to Minamikujo. Fall back! Gamera stopped it from Iaunching. And he asked him, "What is thy name?" And he answered saying, "My name is Legion, for we are many." The Bible? Mark 5:9. "Legion..." He's taking off! Get down! The blood of Gamera. Ms. Honami, what are you doing here? What's going on there? They all look Iike they're dead. Do transformers attract them? - Look out below! - Run! TSUGARU STRAIT Target confirmed. Range five miles. - Attack formation. - Roger. Missiles approaching target. Morning has made the extent of the damage clear, its scale bringing a further shock to those involved. City Disaster Response teams are assisting those Ieft without homes and workplaces, and taking hurried steps lest the alien invaders should reappear. Meanwhile, the shore of Shikari Bay, into which Gamera plunged after Ieaving Sapporo, is littered with the corpses of the alien creatures. For one brief moment, the scores of creatures called Legion were thought to have been exterminated by Gamera. This one was blasted by missiles, but its body is nowhere to be found. No, we're still going. It'll be fine, Dad. You worry too much, that's your trouble. We're not going to Hokkaido. I told you, we're going to Zao. Yeah, I understand. You take care in New York. Now, that place is dangerous! A girl who talks to Gamera? I saw it on a Gamera site I found on the lnternet. Oh, are you still here? Oh, I'm due at the university. Here, you read this. Me? I don't read English very well. "Some information we know about Gamera." What do I do now? Don't just groan! Tell me! DISSECTION ROOM Doctor! I see. Ah, come on in. This way. Excuse me. Oh, calcium is very important to a woman, you know. We know that they don't have muscles. Their joints are moved by gas under pressure. Everything else is a mystery. Have they found the Iarger one's body? All they got was a huge wing that they pulled out of the sea. So, we'd be wise to think it was still alive. Yes... What's this? Electron microscope shots of their body structure. Just like semiconductors. Semiconductors are silicon, aren't they? Silicon is made by breaking down sand, a process in which... Oxygen is released. A cigarette lighter would flare. Glass is a silicon compound, and the bottles vanished from that brewery. They ate the optic fibers. They separate out silicon, and release oxygen for the pod. When it seeds, the oxygen lends it explosive force. Is that semiconductor structure a result of feeding on silicon? But silicon is a major part of the Earth's crust. All you need to get it is dirt. But for their nest they chose downtown Sapporo. Not much dirt there. Why? I could sure use a drink. I have some. Behind the books. My dad doesn't Iike it. Yeah, I guess this isn't too good, you having two strange men in your room... I can't let him have his way in everything! ENCOUNTER WITH GYAOS You know, with this body structure, they might communicate electromagnetically. Yeah? Wait a minute. Where is it? Here it is. Walkie-talkies, portable phones, pocket-pagers, radio, radio... What's that? The things that the people who died on the subway were carrying. - That's what they were after. - That's it! That's why they built their nest downtown. Electromagnetic waves. They think we're enemies. Our devices throw off their communications. It's like they invade and set up bases. They certainly Iook Iike they've evolved to fight. That means they'd probably be aiming at big cities. They'd certainly find Iots of electromagnetic waves there. TOKYO If communications here are paralyzed... and if they sneak into the city through the subway system... Japan is doomed. SELF-DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS I see what you mean, but we don't have the forces to cover every city in East Japan. It's impossible. Are people so sure we've exterminated the Legion? They hit the big one with missiles. We're not letting our guard down, though. What brought Gamera to Sapporo? He must've sensed something. I saw him blow fire at the pod where it was emitting oxygen. I'm convinced he knew what he was doing. So you think he's on our side? You don't? We'll need to rethink our strategy to deal with Gamera. Some people think it's dangerous to assume he's an ally. Have you heard about the girl who communicates with him? I don't believe that story. You think the Legion will attack Tokyo? If not directly, then some city in between. Aomori, Morioka... And Sendai... as well. OUTSKIRTS OF SENDAI A pachinko place? So they're heading for Sendai. - The things are all dead, by the way. - Dead? The chiefs of staff are meeting. It'll take them a while to make up their minds. Right, I'll call you when I get there. - They flew? The whole swarm? - The small ones have wings too. Shall I call Obitsu? He might be able to think of something. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Think of something, she says. NORTH EAST REGION HEADQUARTERS, SENDAI NEXT MORNING Large pod reported at Sendai Station! A 4-mile radius around the pod has been ordered evacuated, and a standby order is in effect out to 5 miles. The affected area is mostly offices, and the pod appeared before commuters left for work... Miyagi? The line seems to have gone. We'll go back to the scene when it's restored. The Prime Minister has ordered the Self-Defense Force deployed. It's changing awfully fast. It might be growing faster because it's warmer down here. It's getting dangerous. You'd better evacuate too. But maybe I can do something. - Put her on a chopper. - Yes, sir! KASUMINOME AIRFIELD, SENDAl Move further in, please! Careful. Watch your step. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to apologize. Thank you. Message from the tower. They've spotted Gamera. He's heading for Sendai City. - We're to wait. - Gamera? Look! Permission to take off! Are you okay? You okay? Loading complete. - What's wrong? - It's shaking too much for the thruster! Gamera's protecting us. It's too late. It's about to Iaunch its seed. It's going to blow. Gamera's at the airport fighting a huge Legion creature! Did the helicopters get away? - All but one, sir. - One? It's fighting Gamera to gain time for the seed to launch. It's not safe to keep the troops here. But... We were beaten the moment it flowered. All units! Pull back as far away from the pod as possible. Now! Gamera... Do you know what Gamera's thinking? You're Asagi Kusanagi, aren't you? Its next target will be Tokyo. If we don't get ready, it'll end up just like Sendai. We're short of information. We're fighting an invisible army. We don't know if it'll be the big one or a bunch of little ones. Please... Bees or ants spread by leaving a nest and establishing new ones. But Legion seems to spread by launching a new seed. If Gamera has stopped them twice, they're probably desperate now. They'll likely come in full force. And now Gamera's gone. Why didn't the small ones attack Gamera in Sendai? They may not be active when it's about to seed. They disappeared about that time in Sapporo too. We have to get them before the pod is planted in Tokyo. We have to find them as fast as we can and hit them first. We can't afford another Sendai. The neon from the pachinko place is electromagnetic as well. If we take the electromagnetic field from the transformer in Sapporo, and compare the two... They don't really Iook the same. The amplitude is quite different, but if we filter it, and look at the different ranges... They respond to this pattern. Wow! So how do we interpret this? When a bee stings, it dies, but it emits a pheromone. The other bees respond to it and attack. Maybe this pattern is Iike a pheromone to the Legion. So we could Iure the small ones. The Tohoku, Senzan, and other train lines report heavy damage to tracks and to cars derailed by the explosion. No JR or other trains are operating as of this time. We interrupt this news broadcast for an emergency announcement. We go live to the Prime Minister's Residence. We're expecting an announcement from the Chief Cabinet Secretary. One moment, please... It is thought that the announcement will concern the attack of the Legion. Do we have the Residence? As investigation of the attack on our nation by the Legion suggests their next objective will very probably be the capital, the Cabinet orders the Self-Defense Force to establish its final Iine of defense along the Tonegawa River. The gravity of the situation... - Are there monsters coming? - No. He says they're going to stop them. And Gamera? Gamera is... This attack is being treated as a matter affecting the survival of our nation involving our right to self-defense permissible under Article 9 of the Constitution. Namely, that our nation faces an egregious act of aggression, that there are no other appropriate measures, and that only necessary force will be used. Since these conditions are considered to have been met, the Self-Defense Force is ordered to deploy. With the orders comes movement of personnel, and permission to import necessary materials. National routes around Tokyo and in the northeast are under strict regulation. Citizens are asked to avoid car travel, obey official instructions, and use trains, buses and other public transit. We're coming to you Iive in the sky over the Tonegawa River, and the usually jam-packed Highway 122. Citizens here have been ordered to evacuate. The Self-Defense Force means to stop the Legion somewhere around here. I'll say goodbye here. - I'll walk you downstairs. - No, that's fine. I was hoping to see this through to the end. Go home, your father will be worried. Thanks for everything. Not at all. I'll be going then. Mr. Watarase! Take care. Years ago, when I was a kid, we had to run to get away from fires. I've never been so scared. I still dream about it. This time, I won't run. - Scared? - Yes. Run if you feel Iike it. Not even Gamera can beat these things. No one will blame you. Go in with that in the back of your mind. Yes, sir. - Gate 10. Hurry, please. - Thank you. There were seats on the Iast flight. No one else is heading north. - Oh, thanks. - Gamera is alive. He'll come back. - You see... - What? He won't let the Legion win. Let's go. Maybe we can do something to help. 16:07 60 MILES NORTH-NORTHWEST OF TOKYO Contact! Fifty-five feet below ground. About 330 feet Iong. DEFENSIVE STRONGPOINT COMBAT COMMAND Assume it to be the big one. DIVISION COMMANDER Speed and direction? South-southeast from Azumamura. About 9.5 mph. SECOND-IN-COMMAND (INTELLIGENCE) That would put it at Mt. Akayuki at about 18:00 hours. Request air support for that sector. THIRD-IN-COMMAND (STRATEGY) Yes, sir. Air support to Mt. Akayuki. 18:00 hours. Order the tank battalion forward. Fire on confirmed contact. Radio silence. Phone contact only. Yes, sir. Your radio should draw them. Everything else is shut down. Thank you. Leave the rest to us. Please get to a safe place. - I'm off the team? - I can't hold your hand now. I want to see this fight. Take him to the Com Center! Yes, sir! Obitsu! I'll buy you a drink when we're through. I look forward to that. 17:42 CITY OF ASHIKAGA, FOOT OF MT. AKAYUKI SAME TIME: FORMER SENDAl STATION It's surfaced in Ashikaga. Tank battalion engaging. It's all right. Gamera's only sleeping. Will Gamera wake up? Tank battalion reports fifty percent losses. Fall back and regroup at the Tatara River. - Request more air support. - Yes, sir! Don't waste any more men! Legion swarm airborne! Bearing south-southwest at 95 mph! How's the big one doing? Tank and air attacks have had no effect, sir. The big one is advancing. Speed unchanged. The big one is breaking through our first Iine! 18:05 1ST DEFENSIVE LINE - Will Gamera wake up? - He'll wake up. Asagi, you're bleeding! Gamera's bleeding too. Gamera's moving! Legion swarm approaching second Iine! Machine guns firing. The swarm has spread out to avoid fire. A fifth are through and heading for our rear Iine. Gamera's heading for Ashikaga. Is he after the big one? Swarm now bearing north! Oh, no... They're headed for Gamera. He can't fight them in the air. - Help him, please! - Why would we help a monster? Because he's... There's only so much we can do. Swarm entering Ashikaga. KURIHASHI DISPATCH OFFICE No time to explain! I need all your power! NASAKI TRANSMISSION STATION We're not supposed to transmit tonight! I know that! How do I know this isn't some joke? Who'd dare use an emergency line for a joke? - Sorry, l'm not playing. - Hey! - Is that Obitsu, NTT Hokkaido? - Yes. - It's on your head. - Thank you! l'll be right over! Hell, I just work here! Swarm changing course. There's trouble at the Nasaki Transmitter. - Trouble? - A leak. Obitsu... Sir, we have to act! - The relay station... - There could be civilian casualties. Take the antitank helicopters and assist the officer in command. Yes, sir! On my way! The big one's approaching the second line! 21:26 TOCHIGI/GUNMA BORDER - Confirmed? - Yes, sir. Gamera seems to be trying to stop the Legion. 21:38 NASAKI TRANSMITTING STATION Don't use your radio. - Fire on the creature. Support Gamera! - Yes, sir! - Safety off! Aimed and ready! - Fire! Damn you! You'll pay for this, I swear! We'II talk Iater! Shut up, you old fart! Get rid of any transmitters! Colonel Watarase! Let's go! We can't Ieave here! Gamera can't fight the swarm! We'll kill the swarm here! The big one's using a new trick! - Where's the second air group? - Five minutes to attack. The big one is breaking through our rear Iine! 00:34 GUNMA/SAITAMA BORDER Down! Asagi? That's your defense Iine. Mission accomplished. Gamera won. Goodbye. So once again Gamera saves the human race. I don't think it was us that he came to help. It was all the Iife on this planet. He wouldn't Iet the Legion win. Gamera is Earth's guardian. So then, if we continue to destroy its life... We don't want Gamera against us, do we? THE END
