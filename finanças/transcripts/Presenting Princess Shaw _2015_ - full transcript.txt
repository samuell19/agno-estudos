This is Princess Shaw, and I'm gonna be reading a page and a half of my book. It's gonna be called Flying on Broken Wings. "Growing up, I was always told to hide my emotions." If I cried, I was weak, so as time went on, I learned to hide them, faking through my life. I always say I was damned from birth. Why do I say this? Because as a child I only knew pain, torture, and despair. I was always jumpy. I never knew when the next blow was coming, but knew that it was. See, the physical abuse was one thing. The sexual abuse was a whole other story. You see, I learned what sex was at an early age. No child should know about penetration or oral sex ever, but I knew all too well. It would be easier if it occurred in one situation, "but I wasn't lucky enough." ♪ (electronic grooves) ♪ Graduating... Honors. Graduating with honors. Samantha: Hey, y'all. It's me.

This is Grandma Mary's niece. - You have some beautiful kids. - Thank you. I don't have any kids, guys. We all look so lovely! My cousin Samantha from where? Chicago? - From how long ago? - Years! Let me wind back this clock, because that was a long time ago. I'm surprised I even reached out, 'cause I don't even know how to do that really. I really don't know how to do that. Our family has been... dysfunctional. Nobody's been brave enough to actually do something about it. - Samantha: I know. - People don't talk about it, because one, we were always conditioned to not talk about shit like that. "You get raped? - "Don't tell nobody." - Right. - Samantha: I even told. - You just become numb to it. You know what my mother said? "I don't think he was trying to do you like that." That was like the... boom! Like really? This is gonna go on forever. It just like stopped me in my tracks. Like, I'm looking at her in her face, and I'm telling her: "This man wants to wash us up. This is your boyfriend. He had us side by side." I mean, I'm looking at her, and you can see. I know my eyes were like: "Please, help me." She's like: "Oh, he ain't gonna do you nothing," and then I go marching up the stairs to get destroyed again. You know. So it's just like... That feeling is like... That's why you don't tell, because it's like... Woman: Your own mother don't protect you. Yeah, it's like... - Where can I go? - So who's going to protect me? Yeah, where can I go? I'm just gonna keep letting this happening, keep happening to me, keep doing this to me until I just finally said: "Look, I had enough," and one day I said, "No. I don't care," because, you know, he was like... "If you don't do this, I'm gonna tell your mother." And when he told Mom, Mom used to beat the fuck out of us. When I tell you... You don't understand, the... just to beat the... When I tell you... I remember beat-downs so severe I don't know what I did to get beat down like that. Really. Like, so if I don't do this, you're going to make up a lie. She's not gonna believe me, 'cause she loves you so hard, so she's gonna come in and destroy us, like, and we used to get fucked up, girl. I remember them. To be in that all the time... (crying) Woman: Women have been destroyed to have an emotional connection with a man. To feel wanted? "Oh, wait. You choose me? Okay. Oh, wait." "I can't let my children get in the way of me being wanted." And that's the thing, like. You've got to understand, most of these men aren't looking at you, dumb ass, they're looking behind you, at your kids, and they're picking them out. And they pick the weak ones. Oh, I was weak. But I think I was stronger... I think I protected my sister. Like, I would take the brutal... the fucked-up for her. I would sleep on the outside of the bed, so when he'd come and tapped you and said, "Come on." You know you've got to go. But you to be able to say at a young age, "I protect you, my siblings, and I will take all of this..." Who the fuck does that? - Girl... - That's power. And then you take all the pain and all the negative, and all the positive, and all the grand, and all the fucked-up, everything, - and you put it into song. - Yeah. And then you post your... crazy... not really... People look at you like, "What the fuck?" Yeah. Yep. (laughing) But that is your therapy. That's how you... continue to do what you're doing. You're right. And people, we really have to understand that we are... we have it. We got it. - We are great people. - Samantha: Yeah. I have a problem with loneliness. Being alone, completely alone, with my thoughts. But I have to learn... to be alone. You have to let yourself feel the pain that you feel from your troubles and your past, and you have to be alone with yourself. It's not easy... to be alone with myself, not easy at all. But I have to move on, and I have to forgive, and I have to forgive myself, because I haven't forgiven myself, and that's the biggest thing. I haven't forgiven myself. I have nothing to be sorry about, but I still feel like guilt. I feel ashamed. I feel violated. I feel ripped clean. So, right now I'm at the point where I feel like I want to... step back from the camera for a little bit. So... bye, guys.

I never thought that I would be here. I never ever imagined that I would be standing on the balcony of a hotel in Israel, in Tel Aviv. Never in a million years. I'm gonna perform with Kutiman. You know, I wake up and I hear all the details of the show, and what's gonna happen, and I'm still in awe. Like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm here. And I always said that I want to experience this once in my life. If I never do it again, let me do it once, and I just pray the Lord has more in store for me, but this is just unexpected, and it's a blessing. So I'm gonna go, guys, but I want to show you guys the streets of Tel Aviv. - Kutiman: How are you doing? - I'm all right, and you? Yeah, I'm okay. You got some sleep? - Yeah. - Yeah? Woman: Oh, my freaking God! So, I am at the show. Do you see that? That is so rock sauce. If you could only see what I see, like in real live time. I'm gonna show you in a minute.
