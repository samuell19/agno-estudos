Just from my eyes, got to be 25 or better in here, man. -Oh, God, there ain't no 25. -Yeah. Got to be 25 or more. Hey, man, listen. I ain't got my calculator with me, but they got to be like seven or eight million on the streets. That's enough for you to get some plastic surgery and fix your face. My face is beautiful. Why would I change that? What the fuck you mean, man? -Your mask came off. They saw you, nigga. -It don't matter. -I like my face. It's a work of art. -All right, man. Whatever you say. It's your life, bro. [laughs] [water dripping] [cell phone chimes] [woman on phone] Hey, it's me. I got called for a double. So you got to take Thomas to his game. Just come get him from the hospital at 3:30, and, Vin, don't fuck it up again. Bye. [indistinct chatter] [door closes] [door opens] -[door closes] -Dr. Sorenson. -Ruby. -Ruby. You missed our appointment this morning. I cannot approve your return to the workplace until we talk. Guys at the department are concerned about your recent behavior. "The guys at the department"? The whole damn department is gossiping about me. Well, how does that make you feel? How's that make me feel? Fucking fantastic. Why don't you tell me what happened in your own words? [scoffs] Okay. Say it out loud, or I'm gonna keep this. Thought I was walking into a controlled situation. Instead, I found myself in the middle of a meth lab with a pissed-off junkie. -He assaulted you? -He kicked my ass. -Okay? -Okay. Meth labs aren't quiet. Meth labs stink. Someone knew the lab was there, and someone was paid to look the other way. I hear you. Good. Good. So you know I have to get back to work. I have to figure this thing out. 'Cause this city is crawling with dirty cops. Do you hear that? [cell phone ringing] Bryant. Okay. So this is my partner on the other line. They found government-issued bullets at a crime scene. So can I go do my job, or do you want to keep talking bullshit? I'm on my way. Thank you. I feel so much better now. [Bryant] Jennifer. [door opens] Morning, Lieutenant. So at 0427, a squad car got a shots fired call about the same time we got a report about a late-model sedan speeding near Old Downtown. The unit checking out the shots fired went into an alley off of Third Street where they found two dead bodies. These responding officers report casings everywhere. -And I mean everywhere. -[Downs] Oh, we'll take that. Me and Cass. No, no. I'm giving it to Emerson and Flannigan. You want Cagney and Lacey to take it or you wanna get it solved? All right, hotshot. It's yours. Yeah. Let's go, partner. Hey, say, nigga, is you high? What the fuck are you doing? Yeah, a little bit. We got to control this case. We control the case, we control the evidence. That might be the smartest shit or the dumbest shit you ever did. It might be. The dumbest shit was this morning. [indistinct police radio chatter] Looking for this? I'm looking for everything. Mmm. It's police-issued, and there's more of 'em. Looks like the same gun killed the big guy. Vincent Downs, Homicide. Jennifer Bryant. That's my partner, Doug Dennison. We're internal affairs. Okay. So that's all you got, huh? Government-issue? This one's got an employee ID from the Luxus casino. The big guy? He's a special snowflake. Arrest records going back 12 years. -What happened to your face? -Why don't you take a closer look? It's just everybody's been talking about your situation. Talk of the town. -What happened to your face? -Nothing happened. This is a face that pays attention to details. Speaking of details, I thought Emerson and Flannigan were assigned to this case. No, no. Maybe you shouldn't think, Bryant. -Me and my partner got the call. -You did? Anyway, I was just looking out for a fellow officer. [Bryant] Mmm. -You should put some ice on that. -Yeah. -Yeah. -I'll get some for you, too. Ladies and gentlemen, Nevada's finest. [Bryant] I feel like I need a shower. -[Dennison] What'd that guy want? -He lied to me when I asked why he was on the case. Vegas PD fucking with an IA investigation. -Got a bulldog. -Yeah. Love it. We should look into that, Sherlock. [woman on PA] Clinical nurse specialist, 613. Available clinical nurse specialist, stat, 613, please. Blood gas tech to CCU, stat. -Blood gas tech to CCU, stat. -Hey. Hey. I said 3:30. He's got to be there by 4:00. Sorry. I was grabbing you some flowers. That's why I was running late. Thank you. What's that? I was gonna tell you, but you kept canceling. What is this? -What kind of ring is this? -It's an engagement ring. -It's from Dave? -Yeah, it's Dave. Who else would it be? -What are you doing? What are you doing? -What am I-- Is this who you want to spend the rest of your life with? -Have you thought this out? -Yeah. Dave shows up. -Dave takes care of your son. -I don't care how many times he shows up. -He ain't his father. I'm his father. -I know you are. -You gotta respect that, D. -Yeah. So what am I supposed to do, hmm? What, he's just supposed to-- You're supposed to come in and take care of your family? That? Okay, D. All right. All right. Look, he's got to go. His game is now. You got to pick him up, -'cause I got stuff I got to do-- -No, no. No, no. Not again. Not again. Not again. I have to work a double. You gotta figure it out. All right, baby, enjoy your dad. Drop him off by 9:00 p.m. Okay? Give me my flowers back. 9:00 p.m. Bye, baby. [Thomas] Bye. Hey, son. Want some flowers? How come you didn't tell me about Dave, hmm? How come you didn't tell me he coming around more? You should have told me that. We men. Supposed to be man-to-man on that. You supposed to let me know what's going on. Why the hell you care? Because it's my business to care. -He's moving in next week. -No, no. No, ain't nobody doing that. Not doing that. Not doing that. You need a place to stay, you gonna come stay with me. I got plenty of room. -You got room. -Yeah, I got room. What am I, a piece of furniture? You don't care where I live, who I live with. You were never home when Mom and I lived with you! You see now... I love your mom. I love you. It's just, I mean, things that-- that I can't explain. It just gets complicated. Radio don't work. Take it out. Remember what I told you to do with that. You pull that trigger, you better have your mind made up. You can't take it back. And whatever you aiming at... make sure you prepared to kill it. [shouting] [groaning] [shouting continues] [tires screeching] -[groans] -[cell phone ringing] [panting] Yeah? Mr. Downs, this is Stan Rubino. I learned you have something that's mine. The 25 kilos of cocaine you stole. Listen, that was a mistake. I'll get you your product. Look, if you hurt him... you know what it is. Mr. Downs, let's not get carried away. I guess you know what kind of man I am. Okay. Okay. I'll get your stuff and I'll bring it right to you. In three hours, Rob Novak's coming to pick up 25 kilos. If I can't deliver, -I'll give him your son instead. -Please. He's only 16. He's 16. Yes, I know. [panting] Shari, how's your mom? She's better. Thank you for the flowers. Ah, it's the least we could do. [tires screeching] Hey, this is Bryant. I need a file on an officer. Vincent Downs. Contact information, license plate, family info. What can you give me without approval? Thank you. [water running] [groans] Whew. [groans] [inhales, grunts] What's up with you? You all right? Man, where all this blood come from? You messed up, Cass. What you mean? Stan Rubino got Thomas. Stan Rubino got Thomas? -The manager from the Luxus? -Yeah, the manager from Luxus. -You fucked up. -What the fuck-- See, we weren't stealing from Rubino. You were stealing from Novak. You got us fucked up in Novak shit! -I didn't know-- -How you not know? They said it was just gonna be an easy grab. Well, it ain't no easy grab! They got T! [exhales] Man, we gotta-- Man, they gonna kill-- They gonna-- I know what they doin'! I need that bag! Hey, listen, you know I wouldn't do that shit on purpose! -Then why'd you do it? -Hey, man, I didn't know! -Man, I love Thomas like he my own! -Had one day with him! Hey, listen. I understand you upset. Man, I'll fix it. Calm down. Get the bag. I can't believe you thought I'd do some shit like that, man. I hit you when I'm on the way back. [door closes] Oh, God. [man] Rob. You don't have to do this. [panting] We're family, man. You don't do this to family, okay? Please! Please. Please. Okay. I am sorry, okay? I am so, so sorry. You don't-- Please. Please don't do this. Please don't do this! [screaming] [sobbing] Aah! [grunting] Friend of mine gave me some cell phone records. Three weeks ago, two calls. And five calls Thursday and four more yesterday from your phone to the DEA. -Th--That wasn't me. -Listen, you dumb motherfucker. You think that we don't have people who we pay to tell us when our relatives call the fucking DEA? I'm sorry. Uh, I was with this girl in Agua Prieta, all right? And the DEA, they busted us, and they asked me all these questions. You know what my father always said about your side of the family? You only think with your dick. It's always this fat girl and that fat girl. And that's why you turned out so stupid. 'Cause your daddy married your mom and fucked her. Sweet lady. But not the kind of face you want to look at for the rest of your life. DEA bust. My cut house raided last week. The position I'm in, I got to go begging a fuck-nut scumbag like Stanley Rubino for 25 kilos. It's embarrassing. Even worse, the whole goddamn world knows I'm vulnerable. [breathes heavily] I'm sorry. Yeah, I know you are. Cut off his tongue. Make sure he doesn't ever use it again. No, no. Rob! Rob, come back! You can't do-- Please! Please! Please, don't do-- Please don't do this to me! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, please-- -[knife slashing] -[screaming] Come on. Let me out! Anyone! Help! Shit! -[cell phone ringing] -Shit. -Hey, D. -Where's Thomas, Vin? It's okay. No, his coach called and said he missed the game. Where is he? Yeah, yeah. He took off a little while ago. I think I know where he is. I'm gonna get him right now. He took off? He'd never miss a game. Look, D, T and I had a little fight. So, uh, I think he's just punishing me right now. -What kind of fight, Vin? -I don't know. He was just being him, you know. -And I'm sure you were just being you. -Yeah. Look, at the end of the day, I told him no, he couldn't do something, he got pissed off, he took off, so I think I know where he is. -I'm gonna go get him right now. -Find him. [automated voice] First floor. [indistinct chatter] There. [Rubino] What the hell's he doing? [automated voice] First floor. [cell phone rings] It's Novak. [ringing continues] Hey, Rob. Yeah, and we're finally all set here. Right. Meet you on the floor. Bye. [groans] [zipper closing] Follow me. Police. There was a man in here a few minutes ago. -He had a duffel bag. -I didn't notice. It was a big duffel bag. And I'm telling you I didn't notice. What are you doing? This is the men's room. Okay. Okay. Okay. There was a guy banging around just like you in that one. You should have said he was black, six-feet-tall, banging around in the stalls. Then I would have known who you were talking about. Well, thanks. I'll work on my descriptions. Oh. Motherfucker. I knew it. Where are my drugs? Where's my son? Dad! Thomas. What's goin' on? It's gonna be okay. Come on, man. You steal from me... and you kill my guys. Let's just figure it out. [exhales] You stupid shit. This is the biggest amount I ever moved. You think I wouldn't protect it with everything I've got? Look, we didn't know the drugs was yours. You have no idea what kind of mess you've made here. That cocaine is supposed to go to the Novaks. You know what they're capable of. How am I supposed to explain this to Rob Novak? Or his father? If Frank gets involved here-- I got your drugs. I got the rest stashed. I'll get it to you when I get my son. [Rubino sighs] [sighs] I don't get you, Downs. There's a right way to do things and a wrong way. I just don't think that you respect the established protocol. Yeah. The right way is how I usually do things. [Downs] Ten minutes. I'll bring it back in ten minutes, get my son. -No, where am I going? Dad! -Ten minutes. How do I know if I bring you that coke, you don't give my son back? Shall we? [people chattering] [cell phone buzzes] Hello? I followed Vincent Downs to the Luxus. What do you mean you followed Vincent Downs? We discussed it. You said he was worth looking into. Yeah, looking into does not mean tailing, Nancy Drew. He hid 23 kilos of coke in the ceiling of the men's bathroom. So I'm saying he's worth looking in to. Okay, seal off the bathroom. I'm on my way. -I took it out of the bathroom. -You moved evidence without properly conducting an investigation? I moved evidence because it needed to be moved. I'm waiting out front for you. [scoffs] Oh, ho, ho. Oh, you are getting a roll of police tape for your birthday. -[siren blaring] -[tires screeching] [laughter] [woman] Totally tagged you in that photo. [man] Here you go. Get the stuff now. Meet me in my office. Five minutes. -Rob. -Stanley. Good to see you. -Oh, hey, how's the old man? -He's good. Ten-- Here we go again. Whatever you're looking for, that lady cop was already in there. Shit! What do you mean she was already in there? Huh? She have a garbage bag? You don't hear me? -[clattering] -No, huh? Did she have a gar-- All right, listen. Listen. Listen. I need to get that garbage bag. You take this. It's my father's watch. I need your help. Please. Let's get a drink. No. No. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I just want to get my stuff and go. My guy's bringing the stuff to my office. Just be a few more minutes. Something wrong? No. Everything's fine. I got a great 25-year-old bottle of Macallan up there with your name on it. What do you say? Now, you know I don't drink. [chuckles] But sure. [clicks tongue] Let's go to your office. [grunts] Hey. This is yours. Thanks. Yeah. [grunts] Stanley, how much longer? A few minutes. A few minutes? [sighs] Here's the thing. You know my family. And we got our fingers in a whole lot of pies. I mean, shit, who doesn't love a hot, steaming slice of pie? Delicious. But my father, he's a-- he's a big thinker. We got a new pie getting baked up. Canada. What can I say? He likes snow. Listen, Rob-- No, Stanley, it gets better. It was supposed to be a small deal this week... Twenty-five kilos, you know, just to give them a taste. Then my idiot cousin decides to become a DEA informant, and we lose an entire... shipment. But me, I step up and I promise my father that our Canadian pie is safe, and that I could cover the shortage with an extra... twenty-five kilos. Your 25 kilos. -I was just trying to help. -No, Stanley. When you made me the offer, you were helping me out. But when I promised my father that I had it all covered, then you became obligated. So, where is my goddamn cocaine? [woman] Okay. Can you hold one moment, please? Thank you. I'd like to rent a locker, please? I'm sorry. Lockers are reserved for spa guests only. If you'd like to book a-- I'd like to rent a locker, please. [clears throat] Thank you. [indistinct chattering] [automated voice] First floor. [cell phone ringing] -Did you check every monitor? -Yes. I lost him. -God damn it. -We got his kid. He's gonna bring us our drugs. Stan-- Hey, I thought you said you'd meet me outside. -I knew he was dirty. -Where is he? I stayed with the evidence. Jesus Christ. First of all, we got a dead guy who worked here. Right? I followed Downs here and I see him talking to the casino manager, Stan Rubino. Then Rob Novak and his guys turn up, and they're meeting with Rubino. Clearly, this ties in to our crime scene this morning. Why? Because we've got a police-issued bullet at the crime scene, and because Downs comes here and shoves a ton of cocaine into the bathroom ceiling? Then he killed the guy. Yes. Okay, he's our guy. [sighs] Where'd you put the drugs? I put them in a locker in the spa. Oh, my God. This is nuts. This is nuts. -We got to get a judge in on this. -No. If we hang around waiting for paperwork, we're gonna miss it. This is big. We can bring down the Novaks and have an internal bust at the same time? -Jennifer-- -I'm right about this. -Jen-- -I'm fine. Okay. What do you want to do? I want to give Downs a poke. [grunts] [panting] [bell rings] [cell phone ringing] Shit. Hey, D. -Do you have him? -Yeah. Got a text from him. Said he was going to meet some shorty at the Luxus casino. What girl? [hesitates] You know, the-- with the girl. The girl, uh-- The girl he always with. -You know, the girl-- -He doesn't have a girl. Maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is. [scoffs] I know you, Vin, and I know your voice. I know you're not telling me the whole story, are you? Look, don't start that right now. When I get him, I will call you, okay? I'll call you when I got him. Shit. Look, Vin-- [phone rings] [Bryant] Hey, Downs. You know what they say at the airport. Never leave your bag unattended. Bryant, I need that bag. -Why don't we meet up and talk about it? -Fuck you! Okay. [groans] [exhales] Oh, I gotta get out of here. Excuse me. Mr. Rubino has requested a bottle of Cristal sent to his office, immediately. -Put it on his personal account. -Okay. To his office, okay? [elevator beeping] [door opens] Nice of you to finally join us. What the hell took you so long? Who the fuck is this? This is Vincent Downs. He's the man who's got your product. And why have we been sitting around waiting on you? There's a lot of cops downstairs. Cops all over the casino. We need to get out of here. [Rubino] Casino's always full of cops. -They follow you? -Think so. And, uh, it's narcotics. They know we're up here. How do you know they're narcotics? 'Cause I'm a cop. Easy. There something you want to tell me? Never a dull moment. [chuckles] But I didn't know this. I don't really know what's going on. Truly. Yeah. I know, Stanley. You never do. [knocking on door] [man] Looking for Mr. Rubino. I think that's them. We gotta go. Gotta get you out of here. Come on. These stairs lead to the garage. Vincent Downs. I'll remember that. You should. [phone beeping] Yeah, get the kid. Bring him down to the front of the club. Go on, get your son. Get the fuck out of my casino. -He's waiting on you. -[glasses clinking] [cheering] -Damn it. He must still be here. -[sighs] -Did you check with security? -No. All right, I'm on it. Stop the fucking car. [tires screeching] It's sugar. All right, call everyone. I want everyone here in ten minutes. You come with me. You go to the front. God damn it! Dad. Hey, son. You all right? Yeah. It's over. Let's get out of here. Hey, Rob. [groans] What did you think? 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you? [strained voice] What's your problem? I was just trying to help you out. You needed some product. You didn't give me product. You gave me sugar. -What? -Your cop. -He fucked you! -[groaning] I-- I-- I have his kid. He'll bring the drugs. I'll just-- I'll just-- [groaning] Just give me some time. Huh? Then what are you waiting for? -[cell phone rings] -Yeah? -Do you still have the kid? -No. I just let him go. Well, get him back! Shit. What's goin' on? -Don't worry about it. -What do you mean, "don't worry about it"? Shit. Why is he coming back? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Um, yeah. Come on. Let's go this way. Which way? Fuck! [winces] What? What? -Wait, wait, wait, wait. -What? [groaning] Oh, shit! It's just a cut. It's just a cut. I'll be okay. Just give me a minute. You stole drugs from them? -What you talking about? -That's why you're never home. This your overtime? Thought you out doing something good, and you over here fucking selling drugs. It's a case. Listen, I'm telling you, T, I'm undercover. I've been working this case for two years, and I'm almost-- I almost got it done. That's why I haven't been around. That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is. And I apologize for that. You're the only one that knows. Okay? So you got to stay close, and we gonna get out of this. -[sighs] -You just gotta trust me. Yeah. [door opens] Come on. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Dad! Come on! Get up! Watch out! Come on, Dad! [grunting] [clanks] Dad! Dad! Oh, shit! [grunting continues] -Dad. Come on, Dad. -[groaning] This way. [Novak] Yes, sir. I understand. I appreciate that. Yes, sir. Any sign of him? I spoke with my father. If we don't have the coke in the next four hours, he's cutting his vacation short and coming home. I want you to tell every cop on our payroll that I will pay to see Vincent Downs and his partner on their knees. [dance music plays] [man] â™ª Coming up â™ª â™ª Power â™ª [indistinct chatter] â™ª Coming up â™ª â™ª Power â™ª â™ª Coming up â™ª â™ª Power â™ª â™ª Coming up â™ª â™ª Let the bass be louder â™ª â™ª Coming up strong â™ª â™ª Hard-core power â™ª â™ª Coming up strong With hard-core power â™ª â™ª I'm in control Let the bass be louder â™ª â™ª Coming up strong With hard-core power â™ª â™ª I'm in control Let the bass be louder â™ª â™ª Coming up, coming up Coming up, coming up, coming up â™ª â™ª Coming, coming, coming Coming, coming, coming, coming â™ª â™ª Let the bass be louder â™ª Move!

[indistinct shouting] Thomas! Good news. Got his son back. I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily. What are you doing here, Stanley? You have a job. A good one. Yeah. Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself. [sighs] Let me have a water, please. From what I buy from you for the clients here, I, uh, I save a little back every month. That 25 kilos was my... safety net. And why do you need a safety net? When you hang with scumbags... you need a safety net. Good answer. [Novak clears throat] What's that? Open it. [exhales] [groans, gags] [shushing] -Is that a-- -Tongue? -[gasps] -Yeah. Jesus. My cousin's. -[grunts] -So look. -[Rubino gasps] -Mmm. My family... [clears throat] ...we have a lot of friends. So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you. So I'm giving you one hour. One. Hang on to the box. I want you to keep it so it'll remind you of what happens when people think that they're smarter than me. [door closes] [mutters] Fuck! Fuck! [cell phone ringing] -You get him? -[Downs] No. And the product ain't here either. -Shit! -Just come down and meet me at the Luxus. Just get here now. -What the fuck? -Who are you? [panting] Ain't nobody. Ho. You can't be in here. Right. You're right. I'm not even here. Hmm. Right. Looks official. You're not coming in here. Look, you got three options: either you let me pass, or I'll whup your funny-looking ass or I can arrest you. Hmm. Arrest me-- Oh! [groaning] John Travis. [groaning] I'm gonna go down to the garage, see if I can find something in his car. -You should check the front desk. -No, no. -Maybe they saw him. -We're done. We're done. We have searched every inch of this casino. Vincent Downs is long gone. All right? He beat us. Are you okay? [scoffs] You know, a guy gets beat up on the job, and everyone congratulates him on the size of his balls. But if I get hit, everyone acts like I need Scotch tape and a shrink to get put back together. No, you know what? This isn't about this. All right? It's about your state of mind. You missed things that were right in front of you and you put yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time and you almost got yourself killed. I am in the right place at the right time. We've got a dirty cop in the middle of a deal between Rubino and Novak, and they're associating in public, which means they are not afraid. -Okay. -Someone is protecting them. Okay. Point taken. And in the morning, we will start a formal investigation. But tonight, I am gonna take the labs to the precinct and then I am going to call it a night. Fine. I'll take the drugs into evidence. Jen. Go home. Get some sleep. Fine. Get some rest, honey. [chuckles] [elevator bell dings] [automated voice] First floor. [Downs] Going up. I'll wait. [bell dings] Twenty-seven. Back off! Police! -[bell dings] -[automated voice] Twenty-seventh floor. Come on, come on, come on. -[bell dings] -Twenty-seventh-- [panting] [grunts] [groans, winces] [panting] [phone ringing] [door opens] [door closes] [grunts] [grunts] What the fuck are you doin'? Aah! Fuck! [groans] What are you doing? I'm just trying to get to my son. -You dirty son of a bitch. -You put a gun on me-- [both grunting] [lamp shatters] [groans] [both groaning] [growls] I knew you were a dirty cop! -[grunting] -You don't get it. I'm internal affairs. I know everyone in IA. [both grunting] You don't know shit. I know last week you thought you were busting a captain from Bolden Command. Instead, you ran into a cutter with a nasty right hook. Someone takes a dump in my department, I know about it. They're shittin' all over it. I'm off the books. I've been working undercover for two years. Two fuckin' years! You know what that means? Two fuckin' years! Ain't seen my wife, my kid! They don't know about it! Father of the year. Yeah, I'm the father of the year. My partner, Sean Cass, he is a courier for the Novaks. He's giving somebody in the department kickbacks. Somebody higher up. That's what I'm trying to figure out. You're not convincing me. Then why did your bust go bad, huh? You did all the right shit, all the right police shit, and it all went bad. Why? Because somebody at the department tipped them off.
