When Stevie and Large's favorite courts are frozen over... When life gives you ice... You make... a basketball hoop. Ah, something very interesting is happening with the wild Stevie. This male specimen is Justin Tyler, also known as the new kid on the block, also known as my cousin from Michigan, also known as just moved here last week. Let's observe. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah? What's cool? Nothing, man. So I'll see you tomorrow, then. Great. Later. What was that? Nothing. He just wants to hang. OK, cool, where we hanging? I think it's like... just me. Oh! Oh! This is a very interesting day for Stevie, everyone. She is going... on a date. It's not - Yo, so are you going to let him touch your butt, because I heard that people from Michigan can be very forward. I swear to God. OK, OK, OK. I'll stop. I'll stop. Just guard your butt. Hold still. Sorry. Does it have to be so hard? I'm not doing it hard. You know you could be so cute if you just tried. Thank you. OK, that's my eyeball. It's called eyeliner, yes. I cannot believe you are going on a date. Can you stop calling it that? Well is anyone else going to be there? No - I don't know. Then it's a date, Steve. Just laugh at his jokes, and touch your hair a lot. It'll be great. Oh my god! I am so incredibly talented. Steve! You look so hot! Now, this. I'm not wearing that. Hi. Hi. You must be Stevie! I'm Angie, Justin's sister. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. Are you OK? Yeah! He'll be right out. OK. Nice shirt. Hey. You ready to go? Later, Spangela. Bye. Cool shirt. Are you sure you don't want to go to that Italian place? I made a reservation. A what? A reservation. At the Italian place. Oh, that's OK, my sister barfed there once. Thanks for the warning. OK, holding, right? I'm sorry, this is the playoffs. Hey, playoffs. What's up, guys? Yo! Yo! Niners game? Awesome. What are you doing? The game. Are you wearing make-up? What are you wearing? Nothing. Ew! Stop. Look at that! I'm getting a refill. Well she looks weird. Dude, what the hell? You just crash people's dates all the time? Yeah, it's what I do instead of drugs. OK, I'll lay off. It's the only bar in town. Dartboard's open. See, it's your form. It's like, totally off. T's a push not a throw. It's not baseball. OK. Show me. So... arm... - Push? - Yeah. OK. Alright, I'll give it a whirl. See? Woohoo! Yeah! Nice one brother! Jesus, what are you doing here? I wanted to watch the game. And cable not installed yet so... We gonna play this game, or we gonna stand around like a bunch of sissies? Be my guest. Whoa. She's better than you, Stevie. You OK? Still our turn, still our turn. You OK? Yeah. What was in that? Tequila. Oh. That makes sense. So, Stevie. Is that like, after Stevie Nicks? No, it's short for Stephanie. Hm. OK. Stephanie. Don't ever call me that. Woo! OK then! Touchy. Hey, um, can I ask you something? Shoot. What happened? With your leg? This thing... I played college ball. And the second-to-last game of my senior season, I tore my achilles in half. Two years and two surgeries later, here I am. Ended my career. You played basketball? I played a little. God, I can't imagine... not being able to play, I mean, sometimes I think, it's the only thing I have. I wouldn't say that. Yo! Hey, we gotta go, Large found the karaoke machine. It's not good. Yo, Large, no one likes that song! Are you guys ready for this shit! Yeah, like, two years on these crutches. What? She's better on them then she is off... Are you OK? You're gonna need crutches yourself. Oh... no. Wait, wait, Stevie. I had a really good time tonight. Me... me too. I mean, other than the fact that you handed me my ass at almost every competitive activity we played today. I did that? Yeah, a little bit. I'm sorry, I - I just forget to let people win sometimes... It's like a... I'll forgive you. Was that OK? Goodnight, Stevie. What are you doing up? What happened? Nothing. He kissed you, I saw! Were you watching? Yes, it was amazing, are you going to see him again? I don't know. You have to see him again. Steve, this is like, so amazing, you have no idea. Why do you care so much? Because, Steve, everyone thinks you're like a lesbian or something and honestly it's getting really annoying, everyone talking about it all the time! I'm sorry, they - they what? Steve, I told them you weren't. C'mon, O'Hara! So, we hangin' out later? Sure. I was thinking Monopoly? I'll let you be the banker. Let's play the game. OK. I'm out. Let me take a look at it. Yeah, I think it's gonna be OK. I'll survive. You coming to Owen's for lunch? No, I'm going to get a couple of shots in. You sure you're OK? Yeah, I'm fine, really. You should go with them. OK. I'll see you later though, yeah? Yo guys, wait up! Wow. Hey, didn't see you there. Your sister told me where I could find you. Cute kid. Here, let me see it. C'mon! You alright? I saw you limping earlier? I'm alright. Who's the gimp now? Yeah, we're a sad pair, aren't we? Show me your best trick shot. I don't have a trick shot. OK, boring. I'll teach you mine. It's called The Crazy Susan. It was my shot in college. Top of the key. Come on. Face away. Away from the basket. Alright. Close your eyes. I'm gonna spin you. Your back is to the basket. Shoot. Close your eyes! Cheater. Oh my god. It went in? Yeah. Shit. It went in! Well done. That's The Crazy Susan? It's not that crazy. Very nice. I'm gonna take this now. No, I need that actually. I'm sorry... I have no idea what that was. It's OK... my brother. Right. You like him. We'd fight over girls, but I would never... No, I get it, I'm... I'm sorry. Don't be. Trust me. OK? OK. OK? Flo, really? You're outside drinking? Please get rid of the bottle. It's not fine at all! And uh, also a pint. Can I get a pint please? Got it. What, why is that funny? A pint? A pint. You can't order a pint here... I don't want to get a small beer. I want a..pint. Medium. A medium? Medium beer. That's a pint. This is a pint glass, by the way. Yeah? Yeah. Finally. Hi. Hi. I can only give you a passing grade on this. Why? I mean, Flo - You didn't follow the assignment. You don't care though. No, I suppose I didn't exactly... The assignment was on Kafka! You wrote about the predetermined behaviors of insects... And their lack of a decision making process. It's purely primal. Can you imagine? Sometimes. Shit. Hi Florence. I will see you at the party. Okay. Faculty Party. Ah, grown-up time. No, there will be some students. Come. How's it going? Good! I'm a bit underdressed, but- No, you're fine. Oh, okay. Hi Alex! Hi! Excuse-me. Hello Florence. I'm so glad you could make it. Thank you. So what do you think of my humble abode? It's really lovely, yeah. You know the rug is from the Masada... Don't, don't step on it. - It's sacred. - Okay. But my favorite piece is the mandala. Tibetan. We carried it over the Hima... Well... The Sherpas carried it over the Himalayas. Near to Nepal. They weren't too happy about it. It's really beautiful. So nice. Yeah. That's really nice. Well, enjoy your evening. Thanks. This is weird. I know. Wait, I... I like you. Don't. I do. The way you think. The way you talk to people, even stupid people. They always feel like the only person in the room. I can't. We can't do this here. Yeah, hi! Hi! You look a little pekid. A little? - Pekid. - Pekid! - Pale. - Oh! Yeah. Too much to drink? Uh? No. Not enough? You want something? Beer, Wine? Both? Uh yeah I'm... Can you excuse me a second? I'm sorry I need to use the bathroom. Hi. Hi. I thought we could get a cup of coffee. I'm sorry I can't. But- I can't do that. You need to leave. I'm sorry, why are you doing this? [No dialogue] Hello stranger. And what in god's name have you been up to, to be calling me at this time in the morning? I'm innocent I swear, just on my way home... I heard the news, you okay babe? Yeah... I'm fine, thank you. Yeah? And that cunt of an ex? She playing the martyr again? Behave. God, I fucking hate her, I've always hated her Chris... I know you loved that twat but she's a psycho bitch... You're better off. Listen, don't hold back on my account Mikey. You know, say what you really think. So when are you coming to see me again? - We'll have a laugh, few drinks...? - I don't know. I've got loads of work to do and I'm pretty skint. Me too. I'm in the motor trade now y'know? Oh yeah, doing what? Washing cars! You need cheering up babe. C'mon leave that town full of sour-faced, clam-smackers and come see me! [Telephone rings, voice answers]: ' Chrissy!” So am I going to get this drink or what? Oh my god, you've still got it? Right Chrissy, let's get wasted. So Chris, you thought about making this more permanent? My head's too messed up to think about moving right now to be honest. And I've already kind of done Brighton? It's fucking good to see you, Chrissy. I'd forgotten how fucking funny you were. I've forgotten what a shag feels like but still, that's good to hear. Hey, I lost track of the women you had when we lived together. That was ten years ago. I've got saggy tits now, who's gonna want me? Bollocks to that, you always had paper tits. Seriously Chrissy you can pull any bird you like. I've been thinking about a librarian recently. You know, less talking... More fingers. You'll be lucky in here if the dykes can read! Is everything alright? Yeah Deb, it's fine. It's Jaz. Look, I'm …I'm just gonna go. No no, it's fine, it's fine.. Ok. OK. You can go. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck off. Get out of my way you fucking dyke. Ow, what the fuck? You prick. Yeah? What the hell has just happened? Is that for me? Look at the state of your face. Ugh, I'd almost forgotten what this feels like. What the fuck do you actually do up there in the North? I'm ready for round two babe! Who was that guy Mikey? Huh? No one. Look, I can't please everyone, can I? You're selling yourself again. Chris... Oh Mikey. Look, why don't you move down here? Stay with me? You can be like my bodyguard or something? I'm not that kind of person anymore, Mikey. I can't go back to trawling the bars alone. That one night stand, Mikey, made me feel like shit. And I'm worried about you. Don't be daft. And you wouldn't be alone I'd come with you. Chris, you're like fresh meat down here babe. Plenty of dykes would love to get their tubby little hands on you. Don't…I hate that word. What, dyke? No, tubby. Do you remember that guy we brought back to the flat? Yeah you do, the one in a orange tutu? To this day, I still can't believe I kissed him, with your lady juice all over his face! God, who were we then?! We had a laugh. Listen babe I've got to go. I've got to see a friend about something. What? What about? Nothing... It's just a regular thing we do. Oh for fuck's sake, Mikey? Two hours max that's all. Enjoy the beach! See you later. Listen, all I”m asking for is a couple of minutes. Look, this is obviously not a good time. I'm going to call you back later. Ok I've got to go. [Off screen]: Monkey… Monkey. Hello boy! Monkey behave! I'm so sorry. He's pretty harmless, he just loves the attention. He's adorable. Yeah but he thinks everyone wants to play. I'm sorry, are you ok? Yeah I'm fine. How old is he? Well, in human years he's 7. So yeah, in dog years, he's getting on really. I know the feeling. You're just visiting eh? Is it that obvious?! Ha, no I just do this walk everyday and I've never seen you before. Yeah, just visiting a friend, who happens to be busy at the moment. Ah… Well, do you… Do you fancy grabbing a coffee or something? You know, just while you're friends busy? Well you know what you're going don't you? Thanks. So when did you split from your ex? A few months ago. It's not her that concerns me though. We have a little girl, Mia. Deb wanted to be a mother so badly. And I'd have done anything to please her. The day that she gave birth... I dunno, something massively changed in me? I suppose that's what being a parent does. Anyway, Deb met someone else… They live together now. She just rammed it down my throat saying that Mia was young enough to forget me. God, what a bitch. I think it was just a mother's instinct to be honest. No, that's no excuse to be fucking cruel. You're her parent too. Technically, we're not related…. I mean not genetically. Look, I know we've only just met and it's probably not even my place to say, but you can't let your ex push you out of your daughter's life. I mean, Jesus, if you were a bloke who used a sperm donor to have a child, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. I just miss… I miss my little girl… And I'm sure she's missing you, no matter what anyone else says. Get your daughter back, Chris. You leave your number before you go back, yeah? I used to love metal detecting when I was a kid. Did you find much? No... Just the odd coin. See, there's a space for sale under the arches. If we had the money we could open that club, do you remember? The music would be blinding but we'd drink away the profits, right! I'm sick of being skint. Renting my arse out for a fucking drink. I'm sick of never getting it right, Mikey. You know, life and its bullshit. But we battle through babe, we always have. But it seems easier when you're around. So are you and Jess going to hook up again? God, you know everyone. She's a sweet girl. Listen, why don't you come back with me? Even if it's just just for a couple of days? You are fucking joking? What? To lezzerland? There ARE men in Hebden you know! And I'm sure you're pretty good at sniffing out you're own type. Plus it would be nice to have some company. Fuck it. Yeah, why not? There are no clubs mind, just local pubs… Can we stop at a Little Chef on the way up? I could fucking murder a fry up. Oh yeah a bit of sausage. You know, they're all posh now. Shit, yeah … Well, I'm sure we'll find a greasy spoon somewhere, it's the fucking North after all. Hey, she's still working! You better fucking believe it. You wanna get out of here? I'm not going home with you. Why? Well for one, I have to work in the morning. And um, I know how you operate. How do I operate? I've seen you around. Maybe I just like you. Oh yeah? Then why don't you ask me out on a date. Let's go out on a date. Right now. Call me. What the fuck? Hey, where we going? C'mon player. You'll see. Uh-uh, I need you to drive. Besides, seems like you're still tripping over home-girl. What? Your bathroom friend? Whatever. I'm not tripping now. Be sweet and buy me another shot? Stop here. You like whiskey huh? This bottle's special. Oh. Henny. No. My last bottle. You're quitting drinking? In 52 minutes. Quit now. We could back to my place. Uh-uh. I got somewhere to be. So what, I'm your chauffeur for the night? Aw, don't be like that. You'll get what you want. I'm slutty when I'm lit. You really don't know what tonight is? No. Lunar eclipse. This one's special, it's in Virgo. Powerful energy for letting go. You're so California. Yeah. Well, last time I tried to get sober I chose my birthday as the cut-off. Problem is I don't know what time I was born. No one ever told me. I went hard that day. Just kept pushing it forward like, maybe I was born at 10, no maybe 11, no maybe 11:59. Got so drunk I forgot about the whole plan. I know I'm not supposed to say this but, I like you when you drink. Yeah. Do you like that I wanna drink more than I wanna fuck you? Wait –. C'mon player. Wait, is this for real? Is this for real or what? Or are you wasted. You're asking me if I'm wasted? C'mon don't tell me you've never fucked a drunk girl before. I've seen the girls you pick up at the Lex. You've seen me before? How come I haven't seen you? I've been avoiding you player. Stop calling me that. Besides, with you it's- It's what? Different? Don't miss it. It's any minute now. It was here right? You can't come up. When will I see you… Will I see you again? What about your car? It was a piece of shit anyway. I'm sorry I usually don't\- You're okay. - It's just I meant it. What I said about you, I... - I know
