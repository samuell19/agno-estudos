HERALD ACE Co. Inc. JAPANESE HERALD FILM Co. Inc. Presented by: YAMADA HIRO YUKI LIGHT-VISION Inc. and BAPP Co. Inc. SHIMANTOGAWA (The Shimanto River) Nii-chan... (Elder brother) Nii-chan... Atsu... hurry up! Right... I'm coming. When you take it... cover the end with your hand. Watch how I do it. Got something... one or two. Check yours the same way. Kazuo... There's a big one inside. Asako ne-chan... (ne-chan = Elder sister) We got a big one. - Really? I'll take these. Get the other one. - Right. Here... I'll take it. Atsu... don't forget where they were. This must be an eel channel. - Okay. Atsuo... YAMAMOTO GENERAL STORE Mom... where you off to. Your Dad got injured. A council man just came to tell me. What kind of injury? I'm going to find out now. It's... only 8:20. I have time. If I get late... big sister's in-charge. Do what she says... okay? I'm counting on you. Mi-chan kicked me. - Suzuko kicked me first. Atsu... can't you manage them! Don't fight. We don't know what's happened yet. As a big brother, act responsibly. Always easy going won't work. Kii! What's this rascal doing? Atsu... why didn't you do something? Kii's stomach is getting bigger. That's your trouble. You never scold Kii for anything. That's why she's like this. When her kittens come, tell me. We can only keep two. Any more than three, get chucked. You know Mom said so. If we raise them all and no one takes them, we'll become a cat house. Got it? KIMURA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WEST TOSA VILLAGE Atsu! What is it? Not feeling well? - It's nothing. Not here today either. - Ya. He's absent 'cause his family's fishing. Everyone says so. Fishing the river-char run's a lot more fun than school. What's up. Morning. Atsu... Atsu... new pencil sharpener... come and see. He'd rather stay with "plain rice"? Her poorness will rub off. - You'll get it from her. You'll be "plain rice" too. - Teacher's coming! Who was running in the corridor? Summer vacation is coming soon. Everyone of you try harder. Call for... Child Specialist, Dr. Enomoto please come... Father... I had a terrible accident. Last night... I couldn't sleep for the pain. Just now... they gave me morphine. Finally the pain's easing off. It got crushed by a machine. Not only the bones... blood vessels... and nerves... muscles were severed too. The company... what did they say? They haven't said anything yet. But... seasonal workers get minimal medical coverage. If injured we can't expect much. In the coming autumn... Asako's going to the Kuraishi Thread Factory. Kazou is there but... the last two are too young. Atsuyoshi is as he is... we can't really count on him. Please stay strong... just a little longer. When this leg heals... I'll get straight back to work. I'll be earning in no time. Somehow or other we'll manage. We have no choice but to accept it. We just have to do the best we can. Today I purchase and rush back. I've no time to feel sorry for myself. What are you doing?! - Always plain rice! Same today. - Give it back! Plain rice. Plain rice. Chiyoko, Chiyoko... plain rice Chiyoko. Chiyoko, Chiyoko... plain rice Chiyoko... Mom... You're still up? Dad... what happened to him? His leg. - Was he admitted? Likely one or two months. Worried about your job. Not just because of this situation, but won't you please reconsider. The children are so young. It'll be hard if you're not here. My mind's... already made up. There are only openings when someone leaves. Next year the new graduates will get any positions. If I don't go now I'll lose my chance. I need you to help take care of the children. When Dad... comes home... I'm not sure he'll be able to work like before. I can't manage all on my own. It'll be good if I work and make money. One less here is one less to feed. If I stay at home, our income won't increase. Only... - It's too late to back out. If I renege after having promised... they'll never recruit here again. Thanks for waiting. Do you have potatoes? - Ah, we do. The ones we get now are very healthy aren't they? Just a second. - Thanks. Kii's had her kittens. - What? Where'd she have them? Must be somewhere outside. She came in just now. We'd better find them quickly. Once their eyes open we can't get rid of them. Atsu! What are you doing? Did... Auntie come? - No. Don't come. Stay right there. Kii... Kii... There are three. This one... will have to go. Kii... don't bring them to the house. Atsu... just a minute. Kii... where did she give birth? I don't know. Don't say that. I understand how you feel. How many are there? I told you before... if we raise all the kittens... and no one takes them... it'll be a problem for us. No one will want to shop at a cat house. You know where don't you? I don't know. If you truly don't know... Look Mom in the face and tell me. I won't say. Even if I know. Listen... Don't be so naughty. You only feel affection for them. Mom gets all the trouble. Mom... A child who won't obey is no child of this house! Get out! Atsuyoshi... Atsuyoshi... Aysu... Atsu... Figured you'd be here. Let's go. Everyone's worried. I won't go. Everyone's finished dinner. Do you know what time it is? I'm not going. Here... eat. Asako made them. You didn't eat lunch either. If you cry... you get weaker. I never cry. When you cry, you're beaten. A long time ago... Dad was hospitalized for chest pain. - Ya. Sis... missed a lot of school taking care of you little ones. At that time... Sis got bullied a lot at school. They all said... she was playing hooky. If I wasn't there Sis wouldn't go to school. So I was always fighting with them. There were a lot of them bigger than me. I did everything I could to beat them. I threw stones at them... and chased them with long bamboo sticks. Brother... you never ever cried. I'm too chicken. I always lose. Atsu... standing up takes guts. If you're really desperate, you'll win. Ignore their kicks and thumps, just keep going and going. Head butt them on the nose! Do anything at all... only don't lose. Right... finish up, let's go. Even Mom said to come home. Okay. Maybe there aren't so many of them. What? Kii's stomach... wasn't so big... four at most. There can't only be two. After the market... I'll go to the hospital. See you. The ceremony was held at 2pm in the west hall of the imperial palace. Their majesties and the royal couple's ceremonial first meeting took place... on the 10th of April Showa 34 (1959). The ceremony over, the royal couples... returned to the residential wing of the imperial palace. It seems... teacher doesn't like you. Why? He's not taking you on the mountain hike this summer. Nor you either. All the kids from Shimokawa are going. He doesn't like kids who don't study hard. Because you two skipped school during the river-char run. An escort of two mounted police... are followed by a horseman carrying the royal flag. And now, the 6 horse and the 4 horse... luxury carriages can be seen moving briskly away. Looks good. Give me some. - No way. It'd be an indirect kiss so noway. Just like a country girl... talking about kisses. We're all country kids, right Atsu? Fool... my house is nearer the Fukukoji town line. The royal bride will get wet. Stop, turn it off! Over here, Sis. - Atsu! Thank you. Tsuga's over the pass... take this. But... you? I'll go with my sister. She's from Tsuga too. She goes over the pass too. Atsu, Naga... Goodbye. - Goodbye Atsu... let's go. - Right. Go with her. - But, she's a girl. Go with her. Go on. Suzuko... take this. - Ya. Mitsuo, enough sleeping. Get up. How late will you sleep. - Brother see. So... Kii brought her kittens. - Wah... kittens? Where, where? Wow... Mitsuo, Suzuko... - Yes. There are three. There eyes are already open. Bring miso soup. There aren't any more, right? No. Their eyes are open. Keep 'em? Mom! It's good eh... Blackie? This customer's going over the pass. You'll have to give her good measure, no Sumi-chan? That's right. Atsu... - What are you doing here? I came to the doctor. Are you sick? - No. It's for Father's medicine. Here you go. Sorry for the wait. Thank you auntie. - Thank you. Chiyoko... Did you come all this way alone? - Yes. To Tsuga... it's 4 kilometers. Why not take the bus? By the time the bus comes, I'll be home. Also, I don't want to waste the money. - But... Atsu... we do it every day. - Ya. Of course. - Well then, goodbye. Atsu? Mom, give me some. Chiyoko... Eat these on your way. If you eat these on the way... you won't feel lonely. But? Mom said to give them to you. If you refuse them... I'll get scolded. Atsu... thanks. Thanks. What bad luck for him. The cold got into the inner ear. Even after the cold, it isn't over. It will take a long time to get back to normal. Her mother's working. She works as a picker and on road work in the day. Chiyoko takes care of the two little ones. Is Chiyoko... getting bullied? Why? - Well... She's kinda like... Sis was. In which way? - Well... Ya... similar to you. She get's bullied? Yes she does. - Why? The kids call her "plain rice" and she's often absent. Why do they say "plain rice"? - Cause her lunch has nothing else. You call her that too? - Not me! I'm... no bully. Atsu wouldn't do that. Of that I'm sure. When they say it... what do the others do. Laugh. - All of them? Some stay quiet. Don't you help her? - No. Atsu, what do you do? I... I do nothing. - You don't say anything? For the one who's suffering... staying silent is the same as laughing. Atsu... - What? Chiyoko... her situation's just like Asako's was. She's facing the exact same thing. But... in Asako's time I was there. I could fight for her. What about you? If she needs you to fight, and you don't... you're not being very kind. Only a coward would do that. Atsu... thank you for the other day. Ah... it's wasn't much. Your father... is he still sick? No... I... We'll be moving. My Dad... left to find work. So why... do you have to move? It wouldn't be just seasonal. Dad... can't do very heavy work. He's looking for work in Uwajima. When we go to Uwajima... Mom can find daily work too. Then... what about school? Don't know. But they said... I won't have to miss school anymore. Is there no way you could stay? I already said! It was there a minute ago... It's nowhere here. Did you put it in your desk? What's going on? Mikio's pencil sharpener's gone missing. How'd that happen? Don't know. Somebody stole it. Only Chiyoko was in the classroom. Chiyoko's suspicious. - Yes, yes. I will check. - I will too. Chiyoko... show us your pencil case. I didn't do it. I know nothing. Show us and prove it. Yes, yes. - If you didn't steal it, show us. Let's check it out. Stop... don't... These stubs are all she's got. Hey... So "plain rice" is suspicious. Her bag. Let's check her bag. Stop this. I took it. So... stop this now. Hey... Atsu's confessed to it. Give it back right now. I'll give it tomorrow. - Give it back now! The thief shouldn't keep it. I threw it. Tomorrow... I'll replace it with the same one. The very same one. "Thief" and "plain rice"... nice combination. Atsuko wouldn't take it It wasn't Atsu. I didn't take it either! I'll show you everything. Atsu already confessed. Atsu was in the playground with us. Atsu didn't take it. Atsu... I... really didn't take it! Nor did I! Toshihiro... tell me why you think Chiyoko's guilty. Why do you suspect Chiyoko, tell us. You're siding with "plain rice"? - That's not what I asked. Tell us. On top of that... you called Chiyoko "plain rice". What's so bad about "plain rice". Can't you say? If you can't tell us, stop saying it. Wanna fight? - Is that all you can say? What! Grandma told us... Chiyoko's father's only illness is laziness. His children are just the same. - You're wrong! My father's really not well. - I'll get you! You jerk! Hit him, hit him. Knock him down! Don't fight. Stop it. Don't lose. Don't give up. Beat him up, beat him. Stop it! Atsu stop. What's going on?! I could hear you down the hall. What happened? What happened? Mikio's pencil sharpener went missing. We suspected Chiyoko. Did you take it Chiyoko? I didn't take it. - I didn't either. Empty your bag. My pencil case is... - Empty it out! Teacher, it's here. This is my pencil sharpener. It was easily found. Look for it before you start fighting. Why resort to violence?! You made him bleed?! But... - Violence is wrong! What this face you're making! Apologize! Apologize to Toshihiro. I told you to apologize! You still here? He said... anyone who talks to me will get the same punishment. Hurry home. Atsu... you're late. You're very late. We finished a load already. Want some tea? Worried about your father? He gettin' better? Ya. After his operation, he'll get better. - Is that so? Seasonal workers get all the dangerous jobs. The iron works... are very dangerous for burns... so they hire part-timers. Let's make stone towers. - Ya. Dear... if the gravel business fails... will you take seasonal work too. - Well. I'm thinking I could work for Kasai Construction. Over there... they'll hire husband and wife together. What about Taichi? Taichi... can stay with Granny. We can't compete with the big machines. One big machine... with an operator... can do 10 times as much as all of us. They say go with the flow... but we just get washed away. We'll be safe... if it takes us too. He's late, eh. Ya... he is. Atsu... He's coming. The dog's barking. What's with that dog? Some of her pups got crushed... by the gravel truck. After that she always barks at the truck. You're really late, Mr. Tanaka. You usually do a dozen loads a day. It's just not good enough. I like the big machine better. In the same time it can fill many trucks. With this one, even with many trips I make less profit. The big machine's much faster than your manual loading. Well Mr. Tanaka... we've worked together a long time. If you scold me, I won't come. The only reason I come here is to help you. Of course... we appreciate that you're helping us. Granny you're awesome. You're the best here. Of course I've being doing this since I was small. That's it... thank you. - You're welcome. Thanks, come again. UWAJIMA TENJIN WARD MARKET Once upon a time... Tsuna village... was called the crying village. Deep in the mountains... there was a big, scary monster. The villagers... could do nothing but cry. There were three Aratama brothers... the youngest was called Tango. He said... "I will vanquish it once and for all." He followed the Shimanto river... all the way... up to its source. Finally he saw a hut... in a very small village. He asked if he could stay the night. - My house has no bed. Ask in the upper village at Granny's house. It would be much better for you. With this condition... in the morning... without fail, you must show your face here again. Till now... many have stayed at Granny's house, but even so... in the morning... not a single one has returned. Hearing what she said... Tango... had a powerful premonition. He slept holding his sword by his side. As he had suspected... at midnight... he felt long claws on the bed. Something was pulling his bedcover. "The monster,"...shouted Tango. Immediately jumping up... he swung his sword at it. The monster received a big gash on his head. He flew quickly away, breathing fire. He saw it... all black and like a small bull. But Tango wasn't afraid. He stabbed him over and over. At last the monster... flew away to Mount Takao... deep in the forest. There is a song around here... "Today is the last day of the year... Tango won't come today." "Rain hat and rain cape blew away." That's... the song of the monster. Granny... so the monster... is still alive somewhere now? - Oh yes. It's still alive now. If you behave badly, it will come. In the 'Thousand Year Forest' near Tsuga there are two graves I know that. - Genbu and Gyobu's graves. The last brother, Tango.... because he chased the monster away.... is buried near the Shimanto headwaters somewhere near... Muga right. Let's go. Careful. Be careful where you step. We've had steady hot days but the valley still catches some rain. A lizard! What a beautiful lizard! Mom... I'm bringing friends. That's my house. Have something to eat before you go. I've already made something. There's enough for you too. Mom... - What? This is Atsu... and he's Taichi. Any time, being his friends your always welcome. Atsu is a good student. I said it to make Mom happy. Nori's... friends have come. You've had enough. Go inside... Take a nap. You've been drinking since morning. - Ah. Come... come in. Take your time. Be at home here. I made grilled rice balls. Wait just a minute. This... did you make it? Yes, I made it. Can I have a look? Did you really make this? Yes. Why? Why not... use it for your summer project. Teacher and everyone will be surprised. Surprise them. - I didn't make it this summer. No problem, no problem. You still made it. No one will complain. - Only... I agreed, but I didn't want to. What I said, I didn't want to say. Damn it! he tricked me. Let it go, Papa. Complaining now about old wrongs helps no one. Whada you know. Just shut up! It was his fault. - Papa... yours too. You went expecting to make money. You were at fault too. Losing the war... nobody's to blame for that. To feel cheated makes no sense. - Shut your mouth. Stop yapping. Here... cucumber! Here. We make and sell charcoal. It's so cheap now... it's hardly worth it. Papa's trying to drown his disappointment. Here's some 'miso'. I know what it's like. Our family too. A big machine came... Mom and Dad lost their work. My Mom and Dad complain too. So what happened... back then? What was it? It was his choice to go. He went to Manchuria. Long ago... in what's now China... he joined a settlers' village on their Shimanto River, called Kyosangin. Why'd he go? To start a vegetable farm. But then Japan lost the war. He had a very hard time. A lot of people died then. How many d'you get? - About ten. You got a lot too. River char... a good catch. Say... Atsu? - What? Don't tell anyone. - About what? When I missed school... it wasn't for the char fishery. My Dad's... getting old. Sometimes he needs my help. I'm not very strong. I'm not a big help. But sometimes he needs help. So I miss school. My folks said not to tell. So don't say anything. Why would I tell? My sister Asako's the same. I understand. Don't tell teacher. Teacher doesn't like it if you're not a good student. Right. Taichi... Come here. Show your knife at school. Even teacher couldn't make one like it. It's Dad's fault. I decided to go away to work long ago. It's not my fault he got injured. What are you saying? You think Dad wanted to get injured? He was working for all of you. That's how he got injured. But... Bad-mouthing your Dad, you deserved that. I can't allow it. Why are you here Atsu? Sister... why are you here? I'm taking a break. It's so relaxing here. Now I know why you always come here. I haven't come... not recently. You always used to come here. Your sister... knew that if something happened, you'd be here. Like when John ate roadkill... (Likely his dog.) when Kii's kittens were born... you always came here to cry. Me... I don't cry anymore. Brother told me not to. Sis... you going to leave? There's no other way. Everyone has to. Some manage to stay. You mean Kito? You're a lucky boy. You've got a chance. I... always thought you would. You can do what you like. But I have no choice. I wanted to study more... and to do club activities... and to play too. I wanted to have some free time. Since I was young... I never had any. You don't want to... to stay with us I never said anything like that. - You said it. You just said it. Don't you want to stay here? You don't want to help out. How old are you? ...fifth standard. (grade 5) Your sister's been cooking since third standard. Mitsuo's... very small... Mitsuo. Mitsuo, you all look after him. I'd also like to stay. But... there's no job for me here. I've thought a lot about it... this is the best way. Hey, Haru-san... It's pretty much decided, you know. With your old back and legs, it just isn't practical. I asked Kuniko, but she's got a job with her husband. I already hired that guy. - But I can do the work. I have to earn money, please help me. If I pay you and you end up injured, I'll be in a bind. What happened to you then? Nothing. You're always down lately. That so? What's on your mind? It's just... I was thinking something. You mean absent mindedly. - Yah. It's all I can do. Always feeling down? What's it to you... you pry too much? Sis is leaving. This autumn. I heard... Granny told me about it. Atsu's just a wimp. - No way. If you cry about that, you're just a wimp. Say that again! - I will. Why... tell me! Getting angry over such a little thing is likes crying over nothing. That's what Granny says. Say it one more time. I'll say it... you're weak and a cry-baby. You really are a weakling. See me, my Mom and Dad left me. I don't cry about it. It won't make them come back. I bear it. It's just your sister leaving. Taichi! Where'd they go... your... Mom and Dad? Uwajima. Mom and Dad... said they'd try hard... so we could live together. Rent is high in the city. They need to save enough... before they call me. Okay then... I'll take attendance. IMAJO Yukio... - Here. KATAGIRI Toshihiro - Here. TANIOKA Mitsuhiro... - Here. KATSUHIRO Taichi... - Here. TAMURA Takashi... - Here. NAGAO Toshiyuki... - Here. HASHIMOTO Masakazu... - Here. Have Chiyoko's family moved already? About one week ago. We live in Tsuga too. They came to say good bye. I see. Teacher didn't call her name. I thought it was strange. Say thanks to Atsu, she said. Atsu... So why didn't you bring the knife? - What? You said you'd make it your summer project. But I didn't make it this summer. Taichi... here you are. What? Taichi... Mr. Aoki's calling you. Yamamoto... You guys are gonna get it. Did you... make peepee in the well. I didn't. Really it wasn't you? Even if there's a witness? Who's that? Trying to play innocent? Your partner in crime confessed. Better admit it. Teacher... partner in crime... You mean Taichi? - So you admit it? You just said it was Taichi. That means you knew... he was your partner in crime. Till I say otherwise... go... stand there. I'm sorry. I knew only you would share my scolding. Whose well did you pee in? That jerk's... the one you beat up. Toshihiro? He shot me with rubber-bands. - Why? Because Mom and Dad aren't here. He said, "Your parents left. They don't love you." I said over and over they didn't abandon me. He shot my leg from very close. (rubber-band gun) Here, here, here... here and here. Why didn't you tell me? Don't get too close to you... Granny said. Why? - You're too rough. Am I rough... me? Recently you fight a lot. Is it because of your sister, Asako. Why? Granny said so... that you're becoming rough... upset about your sister. Is she right? Don't know. You are rough. Before you never fought... hardly at all. Atsu... - Ya. Should I tell them... the truth about it. Don't say. Absolutely don't say. It's my fault. I beat him up. Only he paid you back for it. Atsu... What are you going to do? Where's Mom? Uwajima. Dad's getting released from hospital soon. And brother? Ekansaki... to meet her at the station. I'll make the bath ready. - Already done. Kazuo did it before leaving. I heard you did a very bad thing. I was really surprised. Do you know how valuable well water is? Surely you know that much? Everyone of us is working so hard. Only you are behaving selfishly. What were you thinking? Mom is trying so hard to do everything. While you're spoiling our name. Mom always says... in business we can't afford to make enemies. So I'm supposed to ignore everything? Rich people can say anything? Rich people can do anything? Do you know what you have done? You made someone drink piss. Around here everyone knows. Imagine how I feel when they say that. When Mom hears it... just once think what she'll feel. Can rich people get away with anything? Why do you keep repeating the same thing? Go and apologize right now. I'll come with you. I won't apologize. Try to feel what it's like for someone to drink piss. I won't apologize... not ever! It's just piss! Then why don't you drink piss? Drink it yourself! I will! I'll drink it! It's only piss. You'll see. It's just piss. Atsuyoshi... You'll see. So what? What's the big deal? You scold me about our house. What about you? Our house... you don't care? You're not worried about our family. If you want to leave... hurry up and leave! If you don't like me... hurry and leave! Fool! Atsu... is this your first time to Uwajima? Ya. First train ride too. Don't go off by yourself. Stay with me. - Ya. What help is only paying the hospital. We have to live. I still have a family. Our living expenses til now... what'll you do about that? If I wasn't injured... I'd have earned an income. What's your plan to compensate me? - I understand your feelings. But your not letting us get a word in. The company is doing everything we can. You think that's enough! Mr. Yamamoto... don't be unreasonable. After all, you know, it was your carelessness. The company didn't ask you to get injured. Because of you the company's in big trouble. What?! - Calm down, calm down. Say that again! In any case, you're just a seasonal worker. The rules for regular workers don't apply. You have to understand the situation. You have to think about your next job. Missus... Manager... please excuse us. We've caused so much trouble. No... It's been hard on you for a long time. You've done well. Hospital papers and expenses are all taken care of. Really. For your many kindnesses, thank you. We'll get moving. We're very busy. Dad... Oh... Atsu's come too. Can you leave now? - Yes. I don't want to be here any longer. The manager... just said they've taken care of the papers and fees. I'm relieved! The person in surgery before me... passed away. After such a bad accident... are just hospital fees enough. It's alright, Father. Somehow we managed to carry on. At least you didn't die. Your luck was better than the other man's. Atsu... - Yes? It's festival today. Shall we see 'tsukiai'. Tsukiai? - Big bull challenge. Let's forget this and have some fun. - Yah. Turn him. Turn. Wanna go? - Ya. Dad... - Ya? Sister... is she gonna leave? Ah... your sister, eh... Dad... you're not angry? I'm not angry. Father... You sleeping already? Can't you sleep? About Asako... there's nothing to do. Better let her go. Asako herself... wants to go. Her mind's made up. No one can dissuade her. But... for Atsuyoshi... ever since he was tiny... she loved him the best. In time he'll understand... Atsu. When he's older he'll see. I feel badly... for Asako. If we're all against her... she'll be all alone. Time to let her go. Father... it's good to be home. There really is... no place like it. Atsu... Granny said come back early. Your sister Asako's leaving today, no? We're all going to see her off. Hey... want to try upstream? You can use my knife. You just don't want to see her... Atsu. Why? I understand. I didn't go to see my Mom off. I understand. Then I won't. It's not the same... Granny said. Your Asako's situation is very sad, she said. I didn't see my Mom off. Granny said it was okay. It's that I just don't like her. She's too big headed. I can't stand her. She wants to leave. It's not very sad... - Liar. That's what Granny said. Whenever she sees you now, Granny says her heart aches. You only know what Granny says? I wouldn't know. Suit yourself. What do I know? Dr. Ikegami of the Fukiagari Medical clinic... will be attending the local county meeting. So Fukiagari Medical Clinic... will be closed for three days from tomorrow. Please make a note of it. - Dad... I trapped some eels. This is from your village office. I trapped some eels. Is that so? There fat ones. Really. Aren't you going... to see your sister off? I'm not. Are your angry with her after your argument? Ya. Don't you think she'll be sad if you don't go. Sister... is leaving 'cause she wants to. Nobody wants to leave their home. Sis said so. She wants some free time. She said! It's easy to say anything about someone else. That time it was the same. You think that Taichi kept your secret? Your sister and I both know. Taichi's Granny told us what happened. The urine in the well had nothing to do with you. Your sister wanted... to make up with you before leaving. But you only scowl and keep away. But she said... she said it... "I want some free time." It's only natural she feels like that. Since she was very small she's been working like a servant. It's thanks to her that we've managed. Dad's not going either? Since this morning... your Dad... couldn't face anyone. He kept saying... "I couldn't do anything for her." He only stopped crying... a while ago. Atsu... Hurry up! Granny said to call you. Hurry up! The bus is coming. Atsu... when I got home... Granny said... to go get you. Some kids are still coming. Just a minute. - Okay. Good bye. Write to us sometime. Take care. Visit us for New Years. Take care of yourself. Move back a little. Alright. Don't cry, silly. But... but... Yes... Shizuko is being silly... sister said she's going on a trip. Sister said so... didn't she? Liar... sister's a liar. If you cry, she won't come back. Stop bawling. Where are you going? Hey... Taichi... I can't play today! I can't play with anyone. You ran over them. Her pups... you killed them. I won't... I won't give up. Take this! Damn. Sis your stupid. Dad's crying you know. Sis your stupid. Mom's crying too. Everyone's crying. I won't cry! Atsu... - Right. Atsu... bring a board from inside. - Okay. Typhoon No .15 is approaching from the southwest. At this time, 4pm... typhoon No .15 is 190 kms from Cape Kannonzaki. Moving northeast. The low pressure at the typhoon's centre is 935 millibars. The strongest winds, around 60kph... are about 100 kms from the centre. Announcement from the village office. Typhoon No. 15 is causing the Shimanto River to rise. If it continues to rise at this rate it will soon overflow its banks. We'd better move. Should we start packing? - Yes, start. Takashi, give me a hand. Due to the danger of flooding, please prepare to evacuate. I repeat... Coming. Hey... Will you need any help leaving? I can't believe how much rain has fallen. - Yes, what can we do? We're okay. You should help the others. Right. If something happens, call us. - Thank you. Fumi-chan... hurry up. When it overflows it will come hard. Hurry. Thank you. Get the cart out. - Right. Atsu... Water level is reaching bank tops. It's still rising. It'll soon overflow the banks. Hurry... or you'll be washed away. Shizuko... Mitsuo... Brother... hurry. Here you go. Let's go quickly. You push. - Right. Take the cycle. You ready. - Yes. "TYPHOON NO .15 MADE LANDFALL AT CAPE USHIO." "HIGH WAVES CAUSE MAJOR BUILDING DAMAGE." "IN SECONDS SEVERAL HUNDRED WASHED AWAY" "ALREADY 200 BODIES RECOVERED" "RECORD DAMAGE - 2,000 PEOPLE MISSING" "66,000 HOMES DESTROYED." Sorry Kii. Rotten typhoon was really big. The town center was completely destroyed. More than 2,000 dead. Is that so? But it wasn't that bad in Shikoku. We'll have to leave this house. If we find a place to rent... is it okay with you? Are there any houses left to rent? We'll find something. In the city? Will we have to move? Our business is finally doing well. I wonder if we move, can we build up the trust of new customers again. The village women's circle asked me to keep the shop open. If we leave, they won't be able to buy fresh food. Their lives will be inconvenienced. They even said they'd give someone to help repair the house. But... Well Father... please remember how it was when we started here. I'm okay, I can always sell from my bicycle... if we can't rebuild. That's true isn't it? I can do seasonal work again now. At any rate... from tomorrow I can start buying stock again. So soon? - Yes. I only just bought a new rail pass. It's my turn to draw village aid. We can open the shop here too. In any case... if we just sit here we can't eat. I can give you these too. Why? Something good happen. Mom and Dad... are coming to pick me up. Are you going some where? They found a place near their new job. We can stay together. They said here on the Shimanto we can't survive. If they have a place, they can find seasonal work. Without a house, they have to leave. These days it's become like that. Our work was quarrying gravel. Now were not farmers we have no land. When are you leaving? - Don't know. But quite soon. Like that. It's good, no? Taichi... Taichi... Granny... Granny... where's Taichi? He's not here. Taichi has already gone. Gone away, gone away... He went away... with his Dad? - Yes. Even school... he'll go there too. So it's good then. Taichi... was crying. Why... he seemed happy about it. But... he was crying. When he got on the bus he started crying. "I don't want to go," he said. "I'll stay here with Granny." He cried a lot. "I'll be a good boy." "I won't throw rocks... at the gravel machine." "I won't pee in any wells." Money... like a monster it came here. Don't move now. Like that, hold still. Have a safe trip. - Have a safe trip. A workshop on the correct way of making preserves... will be held in the village hall. Oh! You going already? I was getting restless. Tomorrow people are coming to repair our shop. I can't just sit and do nothing. But your leg? - What's there? One leg's a bit shorter now, but it's not a problem. We have to make money. We have little ones. - That's true and all. Even chewing on stones, if we give up... we stop living. Never give up. So, see you soon. Take care of yourself. Pay attention to your mother... and be good children. - I know that. Atsu... the luggage. - I'll take it. Dad... Put your bag on the carrier. Right... Here we go. Dad... What? The old tale about Aratama... do you know it? Oh... I know it. Does that monster... mean money? It's not money. It's a bull-like monster. But... Taichi's granny said... money's becoming like a new monster. That's a different story. Why... is money a monster?
