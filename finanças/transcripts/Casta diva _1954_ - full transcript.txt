This evening 18 April 1819 in the presence of H.M. Ferdinando I King of Naples will see in concert the celebrated violinist NICOLO PAGANINI Bravo, Paganini! Master. In the second box, to the right of the stage is a student from the conservatory. I want him here right away. - But the King... I won't go back to the hall without talking to the boy. - The public... I won't go back without talking to him. Go! Come in. Close the door. I saw you during the concert. And I observed you well. No gesture, no applause. You did nothing but laugh. May I know why? You will say I'm like a hysterical prima donna. Well, I am. I need support, applause. I won't tolerate anyone not paying attention, certainly not laughing. I wasn't laughing at you. - Then at whom? It wouldn't interest you. This is why I called you. Come, speak. I laughed at myself. At you? - Yes, me. I too compose. I already believed myself a Rossini. Today your violin made me understand what great music is. And thinking of my scribbles I could not help but laugh. In public it is bad to cry. That's it. My respects, maestro. No one admires you more than I do. Young man, your name? Vincenzo Bellini. Vincenzo Bellini. This, my dear students is our day of farewell, when you will leave us to return to your homes to start a career that we wish for everyone will be bright and shining. Those who have passed their exams with flying colours, as well as those who need a paternal box round the ears. Why should you worry? The school year opens... with an invitation to study and ends with an invitation to lunch. But it is an ancient custom in these circumstances, that the students eat little but on the other hand, make much music And not the other way round. Why should you worry? Carlo Zapponi, you will go to Prince Carafa. And you? I make a wish to meet Baroness De Vico. They say she has three beautiful and even approachable daughters. Raffaele Saverio Mercadante. You to the museum director's house. Damn, he's a vegetarian. Domenico Fiorillo. You, the first judge of the civil court, His Excellency Fumaroli. To the house of the first judge, he who is the last student... Try to be honorable. Vincenzo Bellini. You will go to lunch with Baroness De Vico. You are a friend? - I don't have a penny. No, not money. If you're a friend, we swap. You go to Judge Fumaroli... And you at the Baroness with "the three graces". Right? Yes. I dreamed of them. Are you a friend or not? Agreed. - You're a brother. Then I'll tell you everything. I'm sure it will be extraordinary. Me, the only male. Rachele. Go away. My daughter Maddalena begs you to excuse her, unfortunately she is not well. Poor thing. - Nothing serious, I hope. Do you like this delicious radish puree? I love it. - Bravo, young man. And to think that Epicurus said the root principle of every good is the pleasure of the belly. Epicurus blasphemed. - Yeah. Denying the privilege of giving true pleasures to the heart. Great pleasures. Onion juice? - I'm crazy about it. Aren't you Neapolitan? No, I'm from Sicily, from Catania. Ah. And did you come to Naples to study music? A friend of mine went to Paris to study surgery. This I admit. But music is something that doesn't suit me at all. I don't understand it. I will seem a heretic, but... what's the use? - Of music? What purpose does it serve? To strengthen character? To direct the individual towards the solution of human problems? I think that with the times as they are there's a need for soldiers... men of science, legislators. Music is an art. And with more love for art, soldiers and the courts would work less. Perhaps. Even my daughter thinks so. But I confess that every time Maddalena drags me to a concert or an opera, I regularly fall asleep. You are a magistrate, Excellency. If during a trial you happened to fall asleep would you condemn the accused? Well, no. If in doubt, I'd absolve. So, it also absolves the musicians. You I will absolve for lack of proof. Please, if you'll allow, I'd like to bring another test against music on the piano. Please do. Take a seat. Close the doors. His Excellency apologizes, but the young lady is ill. Perhaps the music could disturb her. I don't believe it. Thank you for the beautiful music M. Radishes, onions, carrots. How disgusting, It will take me a week of steaks to recover. Here's Fiorillo. - We'll hear from Don Juan. And the three sisters? How did it go? My boys. - Tell us. Impossible, I'm a gentleman. Tell all. - A gentleman. Don't keep us waiting. So. We'll begin by saying that the mother wasn't there. I alone with the girls. Speak up. It went well. I admit to being lucky with women, but now all three. Casanova. - Of everything. Here's Bellini. Vincenzo, come here. How did it go? It looks like you missed a good deal by swapping over. You know, with those three girls. There was a girl there too. - And how was she? Was she beautiful. - Lucky you. I barely saw her. For a moment I thought she wasn't really there... but a kind of apparition. A wonderful dream. Brunette or blonde, the dream creature? And how old was he? Her eyes were... I can't describe them. There was so much sadness in those beautiful eyes. And a mute resignation. - You're a poet. If I really were a poet, perhaps, I would find the right words to describe her look. Or a painter. Yes, a painter would know... They were the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. Chaste eyes. Pure. Good morning. Maybe I left some sheets in the music room on the piano. Ask His Excellency... His Excellency is in court, but I've not seen anything on the piano. I'll ask. And Miss Maddalena? - Miss is resting. I'm so sorry, but they haven't found anything. It doesn't matter. Who knows where I left those sheets. Thank you. Thank you. What is it, a madrigal? It's your portrait, miss. - A musical portrait? I tried to render in notes what my eyes saw. It's up to you to tell me if I've succeeded. I can say that this music is very beautiful. If you like it, it belongs to you. You alone. I don't even have a copy. But why? It's a song that could have great success. If you want to keep it with you, I think this is already a great success. But you should make a copy, it's such a nice motif. It's your portrait. And I will always have it with me. Always. It's enough to remember your eyes. Miss Maddalena? Mr. Tosi has arrived. I'll be right there. He is my fiance. I have to leave you. Excuse me. Luckily I could get back earlier than expected. Soon I have to take care of the King's birthday celebrations. But I would like to busy myself... also with you. Ah, you're here. When do you leave? - There's a boat to Palermo in four hours. And Maddalena? What do you care? - You're not leaving, it's running away. If you don't run away, I'll throw a shoe at you. Throw a pair, I'll have them for a keepsake. We're leaving without greeting poor Fiorillo who's staying in Naples? Later in the yard, hugs and tears. I'll take this handkerchief to dry them. It is not a handkerchief, but a towel. - I know, but how I cry. And you, leaving nothing for an abandoned friend? What? - This shirt, for example. Can't you see it's too small? - The bonds of our friendship will be all the tighter. Guys, big things in sight. An order has arrived. A conservatory student has been chosen for a concert in honour of the King. Who is it? - You ask? You leave, I stay... For the King of Naples he will be one of Naples and I am from here. Fiorillo. Where is Bellini? Bellini? In his room. One of Naples, eh? The King no longer protects his subjects. Long live the Republic. Secretary Tosi sent for me. - Come with me. Maestro Vincenzo Bellini. Enter. Last Sunday you were invited by His Excellency Fumaroli. - Yes, sir. The Rector will have explained. - Yes. On the occasion of the birthday of His Majesty the King there will be at the San Carlo theatre... How do you say? I'm not familiar with it. Ah, a cantata. His Majesty wants the author to be a student of the conservatory. And they turned to me. I chose you. A magnificent opportunity, as you see. Let the others in. Captain Artoso... Captain Nobile. I'll inform you because you'll meet with the master of ceremonies. Good morning. You may go. Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. I cannot accept. - What's that? You should choose a friend of mine. Mercadante or Fiorillo. I've already decided to leave and... Can't you postpone your departure? I have no reason to stay. But you realize what this offer means to a young composer? The King, the aristocracy, the court. I know and I am grateful for the honor done to me... but I really cannot. If there has ever been a young artist who doesn't want to become famous... there he is. They offer him an great orchestra... a singer like Giuditta Pasta, a King among the spectators and he refuses. He is a happy man who, to be someone, has no need to either command or obey. So you say. No, Goethe. Forgive me. I want to be a teacher in my city, like my father. I have no other ambition. But you're crazy. You'd be famous in a single day. It's a risk that I do not want to run. My thanks. Gentlemen. Incredible. Get back, you wretch. Perhaps you don't know that soon Peppone will test a cargo of new, true, genuine wine? Really? - Yes, sir. And even if you don't appreciate it it will be too late. Let's go to Peppone Catorio. Pizza, wine and panzerotto. - At unbeatable prices. It is also exquisite. Plenty of room. And quality out of this world. To your good heart, gentlemen, thank you. Who doesn't want to go to Peppone Catorio make a small contribution. Everything is accepted, even the smallest coin. No offence. Ladies and ladies, I beg you. Pretty lady, here I am. Thank you. Maddalena. Did you speak with Tosi? But how, did you know? Tosi doesn't understand much about music and musicians. We must help him. It was you? Did he give you the job? I'm so happy. Your name will be on everyone's lips. And I will hear it as a distant thing. You will be distant too, but this will be enough... Will be enough? To finally be happy. Why, aren't you happy? Please announce me again to Mr. Tosi. - Follow me. It's a wonderful audience, all the greatest names of Naples. And you wanted to give it up? - Thank you. Not just me, above all Miss Fumaroli. We have worked hard for the success of the festivities. Look. In the second box on the right the Prince of Asturias. In the third box the superintendent of the Vienna Opera. In the stalls, in the centre, Paisiello with Zingarelli. Yes, I see. Prince Ruffo is standing with the Countess Colonna. Now come with me. Come in. The champagne. Dear Tosi. More and more beautiful. - Thank you. I present to the greatest singer in the world the youngest musician in the kingdom of Naples. I wouldn't say only the youngest. - Also the most excited. I didn't mean that. But I don't want to excite you even more, so I'll be quiet. To your success. - To ours. I am sure that this evening will prove to be a great success. She said the same to Donizetti. Her predictions are always correct. Because I do not wait for them to be realized on their own. The gossips say that the door to success and the one to my room have the same key. For young musicians who have talent and beauty. Exactly. And I let it be said. But you shouldn't. - Why not? Isn't it true. Now, enough joking. You are very talented. I've renewed my contract with La Scala in Milan. I would like an opera written for me by you. Thank you, but I don't know if I'll be up to it. The King has arrived, I have to go to him. Best wishes for tonight. Thank you. - And for the future. I await an answer for my opera. Don't let me wait too long. Come and see me when you want, you will always be welcome. These Milanese customs. Even flying pigeons now. What nonsense, there's a cage in every box. Poor beasts, even they are victims of the music. I saw His Majesty. I announced your engagement with Tosi. He said: "When is the wedding?" Dad, I... - You'll have to decide. The King thinks very highly of this marriage. Ah, it's starting. I'm leaving, all this noise, I can't stand it. You don't want me, eh? Maddalena. Maddalena. It's your music that's... that's so moving. But I don't want you to be unhappy. What can I do for you? I love you. When I composed that music I already loved you. Maddalena, do you want to marry me? Do you want to come with me to Catania to my father's? Being the wife of a modest singing teacher? But do you know what that means to you? Not for me. I know that nothing else matters. But your success? - Success? Yes, the first one. Then you belong to the others. To those who applauded you. To the public, the critics, the impresarios. You are no longer master of your own life. No... I don't want to be a slave to live with you. Would you sacrifice this magnificent future for me? No, it is you who will have to give up your family. Your rank, your brilliant life. I won't lose anything because I've nothing to lose. Nothing worth a life with you, my love. Bravo! This is for tomorrow's lunch. Music must feed me. Tell me it's not true. Tell me it's not true. - What's not true? That you refused to go to Milan with Giuditta Pasta. That's right. - Oh heaven's above! Why not watch over this reckless lad? Where are you going? - To Catania. To Catania? Going to Catania. Not alone, right? With Maddalena. Give me that stuff. And Tosi? - Maddalena will speak to him frankly. And this? Where is it from? - From the theatre, I couldn't kill it. It's in memory of your first success and perhaps the last. Maddalena, what a nice surprise. Please, take a seat. Gentlemen, we've no money. But it's an old bill. Invoices are like wines. The longer we leave them the better they become. Thank you, gentlemen. You find me happy, but surprised. You're not often at the palace. I must talk to you. - May I? - What is it? Miss Giuditta Pasta. Already, leaving and come to greet me. The royal theatre depends on me. Good morning. Please, take a seat. - Thank you. As you can see it's time for farewells. Good morning. Since yesterday it's all taking leave. And Bellini? - Nothing to be done with him. He doesn't want to know, neither theatre nor Milan. I was ready to bet he would become a great composer. On the same level as Rossini and Donizetti. Maybe you exaggerate. - No, I'm an expert. He's a strange boy. It was you, miss... who made his name? I had heard some of his music and it seemed... Well then, I'm not alone in believing in that boy. Why don't you try to talk to him? Me? - Yes, of course. He mustn't go to Catania to teach singing. We have thousands of singing teachers. Listen to me. Try to convince him. It would be a crime, believe me. But if he has decided what I can do? Mm, decided. I'm sure there's something behind it. A woman. Some little woman. That waits in Catania. That will bake him a cake for when he comes home in the evening after giving singing lessons to the barber and the police sergeant. Oh no, we mustn't allow it. If I have the chance to see him, I'll speak to him about it. - Good. Bravo. If you succeed, Bellini will be grateful to you forever. Goodbye, my dear. And best wishes for both of you. Have a good trip and see you soon. Well, what did you want? - Nothing. Nothing important. I have done something I should not have. I have long thought about our plans and my courage has failed me. Do not wait for me and forgive me. Please. Maestro. - Miss Maddalena. Miss has left. - No. This morning, for Amalfi. Thank you. We're awaiting your approval. Is the cover alright? Did you decide this change? - Sure. What is it, Antonio? - Maestro Donizetti's here. I'll deliver them in five days ninety copies. Ninety copies fine, but in four days. Take the orchestration to Maestro Soria. and say I want to see him here tomorrow. Very good. - You may go. Thank you, ma'am. Good morning. How are you? Back already? The money is finished before the desire to travel. You've something to offer me? - Yes. Give me an advance, then I'll write you a masterpiece. I've come back from France completely broke. How much do you need? Fifty scudi. Madam, your husband. - Oh, darling. Excuse me. Come on, say hello to mum. Maestro Donizetti, welcome back. - Thank you. Are you busy? - I've Donizetti to deal with. Hurry and take the children to school. - Mummy... - Don't bother mummy. Let's go. - Children, I warn you don't annoy dad. Don't worry. Goodbye, Maestro. Giacinto? What's for lunch today? There is... You'll see. What a dear little man. Takes care of the family all alone. The children lack for nothing. Supervises their meals, takes care of their clothes. What would you like? To be adopted. Yes, an advance. I'm sorry, at the moment we're a bit short. I gave a hundred scudi to a colleague this very morning. - A fine colleague, who is he? Vincenzo Bellini. Do you know him? Yes, I've heard about him. Milan is full of these Southerners. - He took advantage of your absence. They say he'll be tomorrow's composer. - But he's taken the money today. I'll go to Barbaja, I'm full of debt. Come back in a couple of days. If they don't arrest me first. Dear Donizetti, I'm very sorry, but next season's billing at La Scala is complete. Just yesterday I settled with Bellini for his new opera "The Pirate". Thank you all the same. Well? - Nothing, he's engaged someone else. Who? - Vincenzo Bellini. Salvatore. - Maestro, welcome back. Hello, Salvatore. Announce me to Signora Giuditta. But she left. - She's just arrived. Yes, but she left again this morning. - With whom? "With whom" Maestro? - I mean, alone? No, with a young man who works in the theatre, a new one. Don't tell me he's called Bellini. Is it Bellini? - Yes, Maestro. Am I disturbing you? - It's late? Yes, very late. But you never think of me. You're locked up here for hours and hours. I've lost all sense of time. Which means that you didn't miss me. Not too much, right? Everything is too much with you. You have too much charm, too much talent. Take too little notice of me. I love you too much and you work too much. It's to not disappoint you. Do you think that could happen? - No, don't worry. You'll see how you'll like my work. I want the echo of applause to reach Naples. You don't want to disappoint me and think only of your music. You've changed a lot, in so little time. You pursue success with an insistence I thought you incapable of. It's the only way to get it. In general it's the same for everything. It can't be said that I've never been persistent, yet I'm not sure I've conquered your love. You must insist. Don't you think you value yourself too highly? No, it's you that value me too highly. I'll never be able to repay you for everything you've done for me. How strange. Everyone struggles to achieve success, but you are different. It seems you want the glory to throw it in someone's face. I would like you less acute and more happy. No, my dear, I want to stay young. Nothing ages more than happiness. Nice starting point for a musical motif. Tiredness of happiness, strength of pain. "Tears, elixir of youth." You would sing it very well. Really. And I want to write it now, it will be easy for me. Will you let me work? Donizetti. What do you say? What's wrong? Why so glum. Didn't you like it? I'm glum because I did like it. That Sicilian knows his stuff. Are you coming too? - Where? We're celebrate the success at Signora Monte's house. Will Bellini be there? - Isn't it his opera. I'll come then. I was sure The Pirate would be a great success. You already knew it? No, but I saw Bellini. He's so handsome. Good evening, Maestro Bellini. Won't to play us something? - I've no music handy. I'm still a newcomer. - No, you're a musician who has arrived. You've already learned to be asked. Enough of this music, tonight we've had too much. Instead if you want to have a little something to eat, take a seat. Please, gentlemen. Look, let's hurry because tomorrow I have to get up early. I want to purge Peppino. But didn't you purge him yesterday? - No, yesterday was Giovanni. My friends, I've brought the bear out of his den. Dear Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti is amazed at your talent. Thank you, Maestro. Amazement increased by your charming, youthful appearance. You embarrass me. I should have expected it. - Why? Don't tell me it was difficult for her to perform your first piece. I don't understand. - Mme Giuditta understands only too well. After all, as they say the door to her room... - You offend me! Just joking. I never expected so much coarseness from a man like you. But he's renowned for his coarseness. - Certainly. - Don't expose yourself. Impetuous. - That's enough! Not a word more. A challenge? - Enough. Stop this now. I won't allow you to compromise yourself because of me. Donizetti's frankness prevents me from hiding the reason for this scene. I'm sorry, because I had the same estimation for you that I now have for Bellini. Show that you deserve it. Apologise to him. And who'll apologise to me? - I am. I have a proposal. The Carcano theatre has been closed for a year and has no program. It will be the battleground of the two adversaries. - Bravo, Barbaja. A musical duel. - Yes. And it will be the public who give the verdict. Here are the conditions. The same librettist, Felice Romani. - Agreed. The same orchestra and interpreter. - Of course. And the weapons? - The choice to the offended. Bellini, what kind of work? Perhaps the offended one is not me. Thanks, I'll return the kindness. I'll write a tearful work. Sorry, dramatic. The kind to which you are so inclined. And I will bring myself to write a ridiculous work. Excuse me, comedic, like the one you've already written six times. Bellini. Yes, but with such different titles, dear colleague. And what will be the time limit? Fifteen days. - Not long. Or too long. - Sure. The important thing is not to think when composing, right? Yeah, I must reread your works to know how it shouldn't be done. A musical duel between Donizetti and Bellini The Milan newspapers are interesting. I brought you some fashion sketches from Paris. What a beautiful wedding dress. You should order yours. I recommend the first one, it's so elegant. They will work very well here in Naples. But you have to tell them not to weave it like Penelope. Surprise surprise, guess who? The hands a chimp, the voice a chicken. It's Fiorillo. - So that's how you welcome a friend? How elegant you are. Business going well? - Even I'm starting to succeed. Good contract? - Rich contracts. I also struggle with notes all day, but notes to be collected. My dear, orange exporter. Really? - Yes. My name is on everyone's lips, "Fiorillo oranges". You'll see that the little English will say "Fiorillo" before "Bellini". After all, the sweetness of my oranges is no less than your music. Stay a while. - Impossible. I popped in to say hello, but I'm leaving for Naples. OK. And what news of friends? Mercadante makes progress. He's teaching Rossini a thing or two. At the table, naturally. He has a fine appetite. And then? - And then nothing. It's hot in Naples. Here it's freezing. She got married? - Yes, that is, almost. Next month. After what she did to you don't think about her any more? - No. You see, no? - You have Giuditta. With a woman like that you're not alone. - But I want to be. You're a perfect friend, but I won't keep you. Loneliness fertilizes the artist, as the old rector said. Remember? Bye, Fiorillo. Go and sell your oranges. I'm selling pieces of my heart. Musical pieces. - Naturally. Believe me, of us two you are the one who's been more fortunate. Naturally. It's beautiful. Bravo! Donizetti! Bravo! Bravo, Donizetti! Stop. Maestro. - Signora. It's not good for a man to cry in the street. But I'm not crying. - Yes, in your soul, and it shows. It's silly when one has your good fortune. But tonight it left me. My regards. - No, sir. Don't say good evening, but apologize. Me? But for what? Looking at me like that. It's unseemly. - I assure you that... I forbid you to approach the carriage. I'm beginning to understand. If you try to get in I'll have you whipped by the coachman. If you persist, in your insolence I'll have to call for help. Let's go home. - But he doesn't know my address. But he knows mine. Finally. I waited for you all night. At the theatre first and then at home. - That last night's triumph, I felt finished. He won, he won in advance. And you, in advance, went to console yourself? You're jealous? - Jealous, me? Don't hope for it, darling, I'm proud. Betrayed, but not humiliated. In the evening of my success, my lover must be with me. No, Giuditta. But last night I escaped. Yes, into the arms of another. - It doesn't matter. But far from the applause that was my defeat. Far away from me that loves you. And would I not have found the words to console you? Yes, but you leave me. You're inflamed by another. For whoever. You're mistaken. The woman I love is not just whoever. What, do you defend her? Do you love her so much? I'll never hate her enough. - I don't understand. When I was still a boy... - But... - Yes, in Naples. She rejected me, deceived me. So has she made me, a man without morality without dreams, except to humiliate her. She has killed in me the trust and loyalty you deserve. She has killed my music. Why didn't you tell me this before? You know I would understand. - I tried to react, but it's useless. I have no ideas, I'm empty, dried up. And I dared to challenge Donizetti. And I deluded myself it was for me. You were wrong, dear. Sure... What have I written so far? Cold music, without life. Can't I help you anymore? No, you've done as much as you could. You see... - Oh yes. How unjust. That's life. Goodbye, Vincenzo. Forgive me, if you can. Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry if I disturbed you. In fact, you saved me. I was eating some really bad crayfish. You don't want to invite me to the table? - No, I don't need excuses. Always the same. - It's a compliment I can't reciprocate. I didn't come to argue. I know, you want something, but I hope to humiliate you so you don't ask. I can't be humiliated any more than your rival has done. There is nothing left between us, but I still love him. Will you sit down? What's this about? - His heart is who knows where. He's left me. We are poor abandoned people, you and I. That's why I came here. - What did he do to you? Speak, this time he'll pay. No, we can't wish that of him, he suffers too. And then the fault... - What is it? Be honest, do you think highly of him? - As a man, no. Not as a musician either. If anything I fear him. I'm sure his work will leave me breathless. He's given up. No! - Yes. He's lost faith in himself and let himself go. I understand, but you have to take him by force and I have none. I've not finished eating yet. We'll talk about that later. You know, the prawns were the best. Come, let's go and console them for the wrong I've done. You're crazy. Do you think this stuff is to be thrown away? If I were one for compliments I'd tell you I'd never heard anything more beautiful. Do you believe me? - Thank you. It's Giuditta who's... If you're drowning and thrown a rope do you really care who made it? Come, to work, it's stuff that must be finished immediately. THE SLEEPWALKER How can you remain seated? I'd be up and down like a pendulum. I would too if I had the strength to get up. Your protege is making his name. Allow me to go say hello at the end of the performance? Yes, but no invitations. Tomorrow morning I must be with the Governor. Just a greeting, Dad. May I? - Come in, Maestro. Are you happy? It's a triumph. - Thank you, Giuditta. I can't find the words. Thanks. It's all because to you. - No. My greatest merit is that I knew how to react. Which I didn't. - We are different, my dear. I'm superficial, I throw everything behind me and I start again. Is it true you're leaving the theatre? Did they tell you? - Yes, but they're wrong. Don't get it into your head that I did for you. I just need a rest. Maybe one day I'll come back to sing, let myself be convinced... But not by you, though. - Then by whom? When I've found out I'll let you know. I hope he's better than me. Maestro, there are admirers here. Yes, they want the general. Go now, fine soldier. Maestro, finally. - Congratulations. You'll allow me? I have precedence. Let's go see Mrs Monti. Maddalena. Did you see? Forget him. This time too, dear Bellini, things have gone badly. I do believe that you'll have to write me an opera for free. You're lucky in love. And you know something about it. Excuse me. Fiorillo. - Vincenzo, old man. What a marvelous triumph and revenge for you... To see her there in a box subjugated by your music. - Who? Who else? Maddalena. Was she in the theatre? - Haven't I told you. But what do you want me to do? - What's that? Listen, I was a mediocre student and music wasn't my forte but I'm sure I understand enough to know that your pour into your works Maddalena's love. Each of your female character sings Maddalena's love. Really? - Don't be clever with me. You'd never have composed the music that made you famous if you didn't still love that girl more than ever. It's useless to look for other women, as well you know. You're amazing, you reveal me to myself. Come, it's too beautiful an opportunity. - Leave it. No, come. You're not the only one to think so and I want to show everyone you're wrong. Ladies and gentlemen. Please listen to me. You say that my music speaks of my love for a woman. No, it's not there, in fact, you don't even know it. You're ridiculous. - I deny it's so and want to prove it. Romani, you must write me a strong, intense libretto. A story without love, without sentimental intrigue. A ruthless drama. Ruthless like life and men. We'll see who's right. It's not us you must convince, but yourself. I hope you'll succeed. Do you know who was sitting there in your place? Vincenzo Bellini. I would also like to have his place in the musical world. Ah, certainly. But how do you explain this failure? Norma? It is fatal in the career of a musician. There's been a lot of talk. All agree the opera has surprised the audience in its harshness. Is it beautiful? - Very. But it's too distant from previous models. It's strange the public are so conservative. You miss a sweet romance like Bellini knew how to compose when he gave vent to his romantic mood. Is he no longer able to? I don't know. But they say he refused to make changes. Please, take a seat. Thank you. You're very pale. - A little tired. I won't waste too much of your time. - I've so much since I retired. Perhaps this is also why Bellini's work was such a failure. You have an excessive estimation of my qualities. The failure is not due to my absence. I wanted to be sure. Look, I don't know if you... if you can do something. Read this romance. There's more love in this music than in anything else I have ever sung. But in you comes even more. Your sacrifice in Naples that only now I understand. Your silence. And this trip now. And to think that the fault is mine. It was I that advised it. To give him glory I ruined Bellini. And I ruined myself. You want to save Norma. I accept. I'll go back on the stage. I will sing this romance that will move the audience. Romani will write the verses. Thank you. Thank you so much. But maybe he won't accept. If possible, don't tell him anything. No, he must know everything. Donizetti was right, he deserves a lesson. Please, it could compromise everything. After I've left, after the success. Alright, after. Do you promise? Pure Goddess Pure Goddess, whose silver covers These sacred ancient plants, We turn to your lovely face We turn to your lovely face unclouded and without veil... Thou make reign in the sky... This applause, this success, are not for me. But the music is yours. It's the most sincere, most inspired music you have ever written. And Maddalena knew when she brought it. It's strange how many things that girl taught me. Above all, she taught me what true love is. She taught me to despise myself. Why? You're not guilty. Everything seemed done on purpose to deceive you. She forgave you immediately. But I'll never forgive myself. - You've time to make up for it. It would take a lifetime. No, it will be enough to go back to her. But right away. Signora, the last act. Well... Go. And it's me who's pushing you towards another. Your Excellence, we must be prepared for anything. It was that precipitous journey, in full winter. She was already so weakened. She no longer has the strength to react. - But then... Maddalena. Maddalena. He's coming. He's coming for sure. I know it. I sense it. Soon he'll be here. Dad. Do you hear? The carriage is at the gate. He's climbing the stairs. He's at the door. Vincenzo. Vincenzo, dear. You... Thank you for coming. I have to tell you so many things. I wanted to be poor with you, Vincenzo. I wanted to be happy with you. But you had to be free... for your music. My love. Now everything is over. We'll be together... for ever. As you... wanted. Maddalena. Subtitles: corvusalbus
