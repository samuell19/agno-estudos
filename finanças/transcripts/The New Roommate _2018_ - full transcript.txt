(smoke whooshing) (soothing music) (eerie music) (keys jingle) - Rick? What the fuck is going on here? - I thought you were working late. - You don't even have the courtesy to make up some excuse, like maybe she came in to use the phone and you just slipped inside her? - Maggie. - Two years together and I don't even earn a bullshit excuse? - [Rick] Okay the-- - Come on, Rick, you're a smart guy. Come up with something! - Okay, don't do this. - Don't do this? No, no, I gave you everything and the best you can come up with when I catch you screwing somebody else is I thought you were working late? - I didn't want you-- - To catch you, no, I know you didn't mean for that! - [Rick] Okay, I'm sorry! - Is this the first time you've cheated on me? - I should really go. - You think? - I'm sorry about this. - Let me ask you a question before you do leave. - [Rick] Maggie, enough. - Is this the first time you screwed Rick? Better question then, is this the first time the two of you screwed in this apartment while I wasn't home? - I really should go. You two obviously have a lot to deal with. - Did you ever screw in our bed? - Sorry you had to find out about it like this. (Rick sighs) - Can we talk about this? - I don't know what you could say right now that wouldn't make me want to punch you in the face. - Okay, if that's what it's gonna take. I mean, I don't want you to punch me in the face, but if that's what's gonna make us even? Then just do it. - Even? You think that would make us even? I can't talk to you right now, I... We'll talk in the morning when I'm less in shock and you don't have traces of another woman on your dick. Guess I won't be needing this anymore. (emotional music) (door slams) (Maggie sobbing) - You look like shit! You still worn out from last night? Last night, the surprise with Rick. How did it go? Did you rock his world? - It was definitely life changing. - Ooh, how I miss having life changing sex, or even a good boffing. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, Thompson is on the war path. I gotta get back to my desk. - Good idea. (train rattles) (somber music) - Mags, I'm in here. I was thinking about writing you a letter to explain how bad I feel about what I did. - Did you? Write one? - No. - Do you even feel bad about it? - Yeah, of course I do. - How many times? No. How many girls did you cheat on me with? No, I don't even wanna know. - I was overwhelmed. Being engaged? Realizing that it's forever? - To only one person. - Yeah, exactly. - I wasn't saying it as agreeing. - I got scared. - Seemed like you were enjoying being scared. - Mags, I love you, I do. I know we're over, because I messed up. - Yet you're still here. - Well, where else am I supposed to go? - Jump off a bridge, for all I care. - My name is on the lease. - Huh? - My name is the only one on the lease. Because I was living here before we even met, and so technically everything here is mine. So if anything, you would be the one to leave. - I don't have any family to stay with. - We can work something out. - I'll be gone by the end of the weekend, if you don't mind sleeping on the couch 'til then. - Mags. Mags! Come on, Mags! (emotional music) - So that is basically the entire house. - If you don't mind me asking, Heather, how come the rent is so low? - Oh, you're comparing it to being in the city. Outside of the city, things are cheaper. The commute is a little longer, but everything else makes up for it. - Even other places outside the city, the prices are all at least a couple hundred dollars more. And most of those are for a tiny room where you don't get to use the rest of the house. - I can charge you more, if you prefer. Look, I don't have a mortgage so taxes and utilities are all I really have to come up with. It's more about having someone around, you know like a friend or a sister than it is about making money off of someone. - That makes sense. - If you're interested, the room's yours. - How much is the deposit? I don't exactly have any savings. I wasn't planning on moving. - Tell you what, you seem really nice and I think we're gonna get along great, so you don't have to worry about putting down a deposit. And for the first month, you can just pay whatever you can towards the rent. - Really? - Sure, trust is the basis for all great relationships. - Thanks, oh. - Do you need any help moving your stuff? - I own enough clothing to fill a suitcase. That's about everything I own. - Minimalist is good. - Reliant on the ex is more like. So I'm gonna go get my stuff, and I'll be back in a few hours. - I'll be here. Actually, let me give you your keys now just in case I'm out when you return. - Thank you so much for everything, Heather. - Oh, think nothing of it. Oh, and when you get back if you need any sheets for the bed, or a towel, or anything like that they're all in the linen closet by the bedroom. - Thanks. - Sure. (door creaks) (somber music) - Oh, I was hoping not to run into you. - Well if you ever want to talk, I'm here. - I think I got all my stuff, so if I missed anything I guess you can email, or text me. - Isn't that my suitcase? - Fine, you want the goddamn suitcase? I'll go grab a garbage bag and put my stuff in that. - No, you can have the suitcase. I didn't mean anything by it. I just, brain to mouth filter. - Too bad there's no brain to penis filter either. - Where are you moving to? - None of your business. - Why you gotta be like that, all right? I still care about you. - You do a great job showing me how much you care about me. I got to see it right on the couch. - You know what I mean. - I don't wanna do this with you right now, or at all! I left my key on the nightstand, now if you'll please get out of my way, I'm going. - Okay. (somber music) - [Maggie] Are you an actress? - I was in a porno once, does that count? I was just attending a film festival in that photo. - Thank you. - To new beginnings. (glasses clink) - So how come your previous roommate left? Oh sorry, that didn't come out the way I meant it. And anyway, it's none of my business-- - Oh no, it's all right. I didn't have a roommate before. Well technically he wasn't a roommate. My brother lived with me. - Oh, where'd he move to? - When my parents passed, they left the house to me so I moved back home to take care of him, and he lived here about five years before he decided he didn't want to live with his sister anymore. Guess I was somehow embarrassing for him. That's why all the furniture in your room looks like a boy's room. - I didn't really notice. It doesn't really look like any of his stuff is around. - He took most of it with him when he left, and the rest I put in a box in the basement. - You two get along still? - Um we-- - I have an older sister who I almost never talk to, so I understand how it can be. - We talk every now and then, but it isn't the way it used to be before. - I understand. - Why did you have to unexpectedly move? If you don't mind sharing. - I don't have a problem talking about it. I lived with my fiance. Well, ex-fiance. We had been together for just over two years. Then one day, I was supposed to be working late but was able to get out of it. I decided to surprise him. The surprise was on me. I caught him cheating, and it wasn't the first time, apparently. - That's terrible. - I don't really have any family, except for my sister who I hardly talk to, and she lives in Seattle and I kind of lost touch with most of my friends when Rick and I got together. So I had nowhere to go. - Oh, come here, you're here now. Now drink up so you can get hammered to celebrate moving in. Yeah, probably not my best drink but. - No it's good, I like it. - Get warmed up. - Alcohol is good right now, so. (soothing music) Thank god it isn't a work day. Okay. Okay. - Good morning. - Early. - I didn't know when you were getting up. - How are you fine after last night? I'm so hungover. - [Heather] I guess I just tend not to get hangovers. - Thank you. - How are your eggs? - Look good, but honestly I don't know if I can eat right now. - Trust me, a little food and coffee in your body will make you feel a lot better. - I don't see how my body could feel worse. - Tonight, how about we watch a movie? - A movie? - There's this movie I want to see on one of the movie channels, but I didn't wanna watch it alone. - Sure. As long as we're not drinking. - You'll be fine. (Maggie groans) (ominous music) - No, no. Ow. (woman groaning) No, please, please! No, no. No, no. (woman shrieks) (ominous music) - Looks like I'm a little late, but not too late to kill you. - [Man] This is all your fault. - [Woman] You psychopath. (eerie music) - So, how was your weekend? - It was fine, how was yours? - Oh mine was just being home with the kids. - That still sounds nice. - Well tell me about your weekend. Did you do anything special with Rick? - We didn't do anything special. - No, why not? Too busy staying inside, if you know what I mean? - Actually, Rick and I broke up. - How could that be? Aren't the two of you engaged? - We were, but still broke up. - So that means that-- - We're no longer engaged. No longer together. - You must have had a tough weekend then. I have the perfect guy for you. - I really don't think I'm ready to start dating again. - Nonsense, getting back on the horse is the best thing! And from what I hear, this guy is hung like a-- - Okay, I will go out with him if you promise not to finish that sentence. - Okay, great. You know what, I'm gonna call him, gonna set it all up. - Okay, great. - Oh I'm so happy. You guys are gonna be so good together! Oho! - Hey Maggie, how was your day? - It was good. I'm glad to be home. - I was just making myself some dinner. Would you like some? - That would be great, thank you. - Should be ready in about 15 minutes. - I'm gonna go upstairs and get changed then. - Okay, see you when you get back down. (somber music) - [Maggie] Looks delicious. - I hope you like it. - Thank you, I really appreciate this. - What are friends for? - I know they're not for being inappropriate at work and coercing you to go on a stupid date. - Is someone sexually harassing you at work? I mean that is unacceptable. You need to talk to human resources, or I can come to your job and help you deal with them. - No, it isn't anything like that. This woman at work I guess I'm friends with, she has no filter on the things she says. And then when I told her about me and Rick, she insisted on fixing me up with some guy. - Setting you up? I mean, are you even ready to start dating? That seems awfully quick. - I'm not ready to start dating. At least, I don't think I am. She kept being so persistent. - Just tell her you don't want to go on the date. I mean, what is she going to do about it? - I figure I can get coffee or dinner with a guy. What's the harm? Not like anything else is gonna happen. - What if he's expecting more to happen? - Then he'll be disappointed. (somber music) - Good morning. - Morning. - You seem like you're in a rush this morning. - [Maggie] Yeah, I'm supposed to go into work early today. I have a report to finish by the end of the day. - Do you want to do something tonight? We could watch a movie, or we could go to dinner, or a museum. - I'd love to, but I'm supposed to go out with that guy my co-worker's fixing me up with. - You couldn't get out of it? - I tried, but she had this look on her face like I was telling a little kid there's no Santa. Figured I'll get a drink with the guy, and then I'll get out of there as soon as I can. - If you need me to call you to give you an escape, just text. - Thanks, I'll keep that in mind if I can't get away. (gentle piano music) - So, you look very pretty tonight. - Thank you, so do you. So, how do you know Leslie? - Her husband's my supervisor at work. - Did she use that as leverage to force you to go out with me? - It didn't take any leveraging or persuading. - So what do you do? - Software response analyst. - That sounds exciting. - It is not. It's not at all. I stare at numbers all day, and I log how many people are having problems with their software versus how many of them don't really actually know how to use their computer. Okay, that last bit was my interpretation. - Oh. - But it is a mind numbing job. - That sounds a lot like my job. I think you could put an inflatable doll in my chair, and nobody would know the difference. - Oh no, stop. - Except Leslie, no she would wonder why I'm not responding to her. - Well it sounds like Leslie. - I know. - So, where are you from originally? - Oh, I've lived all over. It's not an interesting story. - No, go ahead, please tell me. Where's the most interesting place that you've lived? - Well, when I lived in Maine we got to eat a lot of lobster, which I liked. Connecticut was full of yuppie white people, so that was fine. The Midwest was not interesting. The West Coast was cool, but there was a lot of sunshine and I'm a little bit pale for that. - What about like Hawaii or Alaska? - [Maggie] You know I wish, that would be-- - No, no? - I would love to live in Hawaii, no never. - [Woman] Remember what he did to Cathy for trying to escape? Hurry up before he gets back. - Oh, I wasn't expecting you to still be up. - How'd it go? - Went all right, I guess. - Long night of drinking? - We ended up going to dinner. - Is there gonna be a second date? - I don't know, he was an interesting guy, but it felt weird being on a date. I don't know if I'm ready to be dating again so soon after Rick. - That makes sense. At least you gave it a try. - I think I'm gonna go to bed, I'm pretty tired. - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. - So, how did it go? - He was nice. - Did you two kiss, or did something more happen? - It was a first date, what do you think happened? - Well I don't know, with my husband on our first date I got pregnant. - Okay, well that definitely couldn't have happened on this date. - Oh no, Thompson. He's looking around, I gotta get back to my desk. - I made dinner for us. - Oh, I wish I'd known that beforehand. I have dinner plans. - You have dinner plans? - Yeah, going to dinner with Josh. - I thought you said you weren't really ready to date someone yet. - He's a nice guy, and he called asking to have dinner with me, so I figure what's the harm? - I mean the harm is in going out with him when you said you weren't ready to date someone. - Well I told him I just got out of a relationship not that long ago, and I'm not looking for anything too serious. He was okay with it. - Of course he would be. You basically told him he could screw you and doesn't have to call you after. - I don't see how you get that from it. Besides, I'm a big girl, I can handle myself. - You don't wanna be late for dinner. - Okay. - Waste of food. (eerie music) - Do you know what Thursday was? - [Man] No. - Hi. - Wasn't expecting you to be home so early. - Oh, we just had a quick dinner, that was it. - Just seems quick for dinner, that's all. - I'm sorry you made dinner and I was going out. I hope it wasn't too much trouble that you went to. - It's no big deal. I wanted to surprise you with dinner. I really should've asked if you were gonna be around first. - It looked delicious. - Thanks. So what did you have for dinner? - We went to a Greek restaurant. I just had a salad. - Are you still hungry? I can make you something. - No, thank you. It was a big salad. - Did you have a nice time with Josh? - Yeah, it was fun. It is nice sometimes just to go out. - I know what you mean. So are you gonna see him again? - This weekend, he's coming here actually. - So I'll get to meet him? - If you're home at the time, then you will. - Good, I'm looking forward to it. - What are you watching on TV? - Oh just some random movie. - Is it good? - It's all right. - Do you wanna turn it back on? I'm up for a little television. - Okay. - [Woman] Does March 24th mean anything to you? - [Man] Should it? - It was our anniversary. The fifth one in a row that you forgot. - I-- - No, you don't have to explain anything. You don't have to make any excuses. The first time, I thought it's no big deal. (Josh knocking) - Heather, can you get the door and tell Josh I'll be down in less than five minutes? - [Heather] Okay. - So you must be the roommate, Heather. I'm Josh. - I know what you're up to. I always know what your type is up to. - I'm sorry, did I miss something? - I looked you up online, I found out where you live. - Okay, and? - And if you do anything to remotely hurt Maggie, I will come and cut off your penis in your sleep and feed it to you. (eerie music) - I would never do anything to hurt Maggie, she's a nice girl. - Even if it's something that I just suspect might hurt her down the line? I'll be paying you a visit. Here she is! Josh and I were just having a nice conversation, getting to know each other. - Okay, good. - Yeah. - I'll be upstairs. Nice meeting you, Josh. Have a good time. - You ready? - I wanted to talk to you. - Do you wanna talk on the way? - Mm, we need to talk now. - Okay, about what? - I don't think we're working out. - You came all the way here to tell me that? You could've just done it on the phone. - I wanted to do it face to face. - I don't really know what to say. - Are you gonna be okay? - I don't see why I wouldn't be. - I'm really sorry about this. - It happens, bye. - Is everything okay? I thought you and Josh were going out to eat. - Yeah, I thought so too. He just ended things with me. - I'm so sorry, are you okay? - I'm fine. I just thought it was weird he came all the way out here to tell me in person. - I guess he just thought it was the nicer thing to do? I just made a fresh pot of coffee. Would you like a cup? - Sure. - Do you want to talk about it? - Nothing to talk about. I said it wasn't anything serious, just someone to go out with. - Good cup of coffee will keep you just as warm as a man. (Maggie laughs) What? - I just thought the comparison was funny, somehow. - Oh, laughter is the best medicine. - Then here's to my health. - This movie just came out. "Battlespace Galaxy," something or other sci-fi. - I think I know what movie you're talking about. - Do you want to go to the movies? We could get lunch beforehand, make it a girls' day out. - Sure, that sounds like fun. - Maggie, I just found out from Josh that it didn't work out between youse two. - Yeah, but it's okay. - Well when did this happen? - Last weekend. - And you didn't tell me? You made me wait four days, I had to find out from him? - It's not really a big deal. - And I was certain that you two would be so good together. Hey, did you at least sleep with him? - What? - Well I heard he's good in the sack! I'd like for him to give me a spin around the world. - No, I didn't sleep with him. We only went to dinner twice. It never got anywhere near that. - Well maybe a little hand action under the dinner table, huh? - Nope, nothing. He gave me a kiss on our second date, that's all. - That's too bad. I was really hoping you could give me the juicy details on how he was, you know? - Sorry to disappoint you. - I would break my wedding vows for a night with him. - Okay, I'm going back to doing my work. - Okay, but I got another guy for you to meet. - I don't need another guy, thank you. - Oh are you sure? This is a really nice guy, and he's got a really-- - Yeah, I'm sure. - Okay. But you are coming to the club with us tomorrow, right? - Yes. - Good, okay. We'll find you some tail there. - That's okay. I'm going back to doing my work now. - Okay, maybe I'll find myself some tail at the club. Hey, Anne. You're coming to the club with us tomorrow, right? - Yeah, of course I am. - Good, good, tail all around! - All right, I'll see you over there. - [Leslie] See you there. - Hey, how was your day? - Same as usual, uneventful and boring. - I was gonna make Italian food later if you want some. - Yeah, sure I guess. - Good, wash up and change and I'll have dinner ready in about 30 minutes, sound good? - Sounds good. - Oh and tomorrow I was thinking about making a stew in the slow cooker. You like stew, right? - Tomorrow night I'm going to some club with a few people from work. - Oh. - Do you want to come along? - No, thank you. It's probably more of a work thing, I imagine. - I guess. - Dinner will be ready in 30 minutes. - Hey, Downton! You coming to the club with everybody tonight? - Of course, I have this really cute outfit I'm just dying to wear. - Ooh, well maybe we could find someone at the club who'll wanna take the cute outfit off ya, you know what I mean? - I have a boyfriend. - Well if you ditch him, we'll have a lot more fun! - Or I could just not tell him what happens. - Ooh, I like the way you think, look at you! - Is everyone from the office going? - Yeah, everyone down to the mailroom. We're all going. - That sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun then. - Oh yeah, definitely. I can't wait. Wear that sexy little cute thing. (upbeat house music) - [Woman] I think you remember how the rest of the story goes. (Maggie giggling) - Oh god. - That is far enough, mister. I will take her from here. - I wasn't, look I just wanted to get her home safe. She's a little drunk. - So you're just being a good Samaritan? - We work together. I'm an accountant, but in the same company. I'm Bob. - I don't care what your name is, bub. I'm not gonna let you take advantage of her. - I wasn't going to. I just wanted to get her home safe, that's all. - Bye. - I'll be going now, goodnight. (eerie music) (Maggie muttering) - How are you feeling this morning? - Confused. I don't remember exactly how I got home last night, and... - And? - Nothing. - And whether or not you came home alone last night? - I came home with someone? - You came in here hammered with some guy named Bob ready to go to your room with you. - Bob did this? He seems like such a nice person. - I sent him away. - You sent him away? - You were clearly drunk, and I can only imagine what his intentions were for you in that condition. - Bob is married, and never out of line with anyone. I doubt he was planning anything. - Being so drunk, how do you know what he would've done? - So, the photos? - I took those. - What? - To show you what could happen when you're so careless and irresponsible and get drunk like that. - You took nude photos of me on my phone to prove to me not to get drunk? - Yes. - To prove that people can be extremely irresponsible with you when drunk? - Exactly. - So the photos on my phone, they're the only ones? - Yes, I hope you realize how reckless your behavior was. - Oh, I realize a lot. (eerie music) (gentle piano music) (Maggie groans) (phone rings) Hello? You've gotta be kidding me, I'm not interested. What could you possibly have to say? Fine. I will meet you for coffee, but then you just need to leave me alone forever, okay? See you soon. (upbeat music) - Maggie, hi. - Hi. - Sit, please. Thanks for coming. Here, I got you a coffee. - I'm still deciding whether or not to get up and leave. - Look Maggie, I messed up. I was scared. The pressure got to me. - You didn't think to just talk to me about it? I would've understood. - No you wouldn't have. You didn't have any doubts or fears? I did, right? I didn't know if I was more scared about getting married in the future, or about you finding out that I was scared. - You didn't think I was scared? Rick, forever is a long time, but we could've talked about it. We should've talked about it. - I've been thinking about it a lot, and you're right. I just, I don't wanna be without you. - What about the other women? - I'll give 'em all up. I mean I'll never be unfaithful again. - Hold on, give them all up? You're still with other women and you're trying to get me back? - Well we're not together right now, so what's the big deal? - You're a real piece of work. - Come on Maggie, I'm telling you I'm gonna change for you. That's the important thing! - Rick, let me ask you a question. Were you always such a piece of shit, or did you just become this way? - Maggie, I love you and I care about you a lot. - Do you even believe the words that come out of your mouth, or are you just 100% full of crap? - My feelings for you are real, that's all I know. - Okay, well my feelings for you are 100% gone, that's all I know. Thanks for the coffee. Let's not do this again. ♪ Not your fault ♪ ♪ That you take such heart in your suffering ♪ - Because I want you to understand what my life was like after my parents died, and I had to live with my uncle. - What does that have to do with me? - Oh, dear man. It has everything to do with you. - Hey, I went to the supermarket and picked up some nice lamb chops for dinner. I hope you're hungry. - Thank you, but I actually ate while I was out, so I'm not hungry. - Oh, where'd you go? - For coffee, then grabbed a bite to eat. - Coffee with whom? - Rick. - Your ex-fiance Rick? - Yeah. - Why would you go see that cheating bastard? - He called, said he wanted to talk. Figured I'd hear him out. - What did he have to say for himself, how sorry he was and how he'll never do it again? - How he was sorry and wanted to get back together. - You can't seriously be thinking about getting back together with him. - I'm thinking about it. We were good together. - Until you catch him with someone else! - You know if we do end up getting back together, I guess that would mean I'd be moving out of here and back in with him. - You would move back in with him? Why would you do that? - Well I mean if we were dating, why wouldn't I? Plus I wouldn't have to worry about bills, or rent. - If the rent is an issue, we can work something out. - Ah, it's still in the early stages. I guess we'll see what happens. (eerie music) - Good morning. - Morning. - Would you like me to-- - [Maggie] Nope, I'm good with just coffee. Off to work. - I bet you could. I remember it like it was yesterday. These past two years-- - What are you watching? - Just some random romantic drama. - Is it any good? - It's all right. - This would've happened. (phone rings) - Hello. This is Maggie. Hi Tom, I remember you. What? What happened? Oh my god. (gentle piano music) Thank you for letting me know. Do you know what time the service is? Thanks. - What's wrong? - It's Rick, he's dead. - Guess it's karma. - What? - That's what he gets for going too fast and not braking. - How did you know? - Know what? - That he died from crashing his car. They think he was driving too fast and didn't hit the brakes in time. He collided with a truck at full speed. - I was just talking about the way he lived his life, fast with the women and not stopping. - I think I'm gonna go upstairs. - Are you sure? I don't think you should be alone right now. We can talk if you want. - I just need to process all of it. I can't believe he's really dead. - I'll be here if you need a shoulder to lean on, or an ear to listen. - Thanks. - Going there was the best decision I ever made. If I could do it again, I wouldn't change a thing. - Oh, not a thing? (somber music) (Maggie sobbing) - [Heather] Guess it's karma. That's what he gets for going too fast and not braking. (eerie music) (intense music) - What are you doing? - I was just curious about what was in the box, so I took a look. - Is that yours to look through? - No, but I didn't think that-- (Maggie yelps) - Right, you didn't think! - What the hell? - Come with me. (ominous music) You are gonna sit in the corner and think about what you've done. - What, are you serious? - You need to think about what you've done wrong! - I'm sorry, okay, okay! (eerie music) (floor creaks) (gentle piano music) Is it okay for me to come upstairs? - I almost forgot you were down there. I'm so sorry I did that. I don't know what came over me. - It was a little scary. I'm sorry I was going through your brother's stuff. I don't know what came over me. - I completely overreacted, and I shouldn't have done that. Sit, please? Let me explain. - It's okay, you don't have to. - Please. - Okay. - I pretty much raised Jimmy. He started getting into so much trouble that I had no choice but to discipline him. Something about you going through his stuff just made me snap back to him getting into mischief. - I didn't mean to upset you. It's not gonna happen again. - I'm so sorry I threw you in a closet, and that I slapped you. - It's okay. - Are we still friends? - Yeah, still friends. - You are my best friend. I would never want you to be mad at me. - Best friend? - Yeah, you are. - Thanks. - Can I make you something, a sandwich or coffee? - I'm okay. - Okay. - I'm gonna go to my room now. - I'll be here if you need anything. (eerie music) (Maggie panting) - Hi, Nancy it's me. I know it's been a while. I wish I could say I was doing well, but things are insane. My roommate is fucking psychotic. I'm honestly afraid of her. I would move out, but I don't have any money. I barely make enough to cover my rent! We broke up. And he... Passed away. Thanks. Listen, my job sucks and I don't really have anything going for me here. Do you think I could come stay with you for a while until I get back on my feet? Why not? Okay then. Talk to you later. Oh my god. (somber music) (Maggie sobbing) Okay. Okay. - Good morning. - Morning. - You're running a little late to head off to work today, aren't you? - Got off to a slow start this morning. - I made you lunch. - Thanks. - Have a good day! (Heather giggles) - Heather, is that you? Sorry, I heard a noise and didn't know you were home. - Was that your roommate? - Yes, now you need to leave now. - Why, doesn't she know you're a lesbian? - Don't call me that! - Okay. Whatever. (Heather knocking) - Come in. Hey. I didn't mean to walk in on you. I didn't know you were home, and I heard a noise. - How come you aren't at work? - I took the day off today. Had some comp time to use up. - So you saw. - I didn't see anything. It's completely your business, anyway. - You must think less of me now. - Why would I think less of you? - I don't do that often. - It's completely your business. I don't judge you. - Just tell me you don't think less of me for it. - I don't, it's really none of my business. You can do whatever you want. - Haha, lesbian, lesbian, you're a lesbian! - Stop it, no I'm not! - Ah you were with a woman, so that makes you a lesbian! - No it doesn't, just shut up! (Jimmy babbling) Stop it! - Is that what you do to your girlfriend, lesbian? - I'm not a lesbian, we were just experimenting, shut up! - Oh yeah right. You're a lesbian, and I know. - Stop! - [Man] At my place, they would probably just ignore it. - My neighbors would probably just listen in on it. - Really? - [Heather] Can we talk? - Sure. What's up? - I just really wanted to thank you for not being weird about what happened the other day. - What happened the other day? - What you saw? - Oh yeah, no I'm sorry I just walked into your room. - But still, I appreciate you not making fun of me for it. - Why would I make fun of you for it? - I think I know why you're okay with it. - What are you doing? - It's okay, you don't have to be afraid. I feel the same way. - The same way as what? What are you talking about? - The way we are together, always there for each other, close like sister? - We are not close like sisters, and I sure as hell don't have feelings for you. - I was afraid of those feelings at first too, but you don't have to be. We can be together. - You are fucking insane! - How can you say that? We are perfect for each other. We were meant to be together! - Look Heather, I'm sorry but I don't share those same feelings. - Yes, you do. You're just too afraid to admit them! - Okay, I think I'm gonna go upstairs and pack my stuff 'cause me living here isn't working out. - You ungrateful little bitch! - I'm sorry if I did anything to give you the wrong idea. (somber music) (eerie music) - Hey Amanda! Did you hear about Maggie? She called and left a message on the manager's voicemail this morning saying she quit. - Just like that, no advance notice? - Yeah, I guess she just needed a change. - That is pretty all of a sudden. - Maybe she found a guy and decided she wanted to shack up.
