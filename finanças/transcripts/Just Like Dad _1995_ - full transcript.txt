I'VE NEVER TIMED IT. MAYBE IT'S TIME WE FIND OUT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT... IT WON'T BE NECESSARY. DON'T PAY THEM, CHARLIE. DON'T GIVE 'EM A DIME. DON'T! THANKS, CHARLIE. THAT'S REAL COOPERATIVE OF YOU. VIOLENCE IS AN UGLY THING. REAL UGLY. [ Laughing ] HEY, NEXT WEEK-- DOUBLE! YOU OK? WHY'D YOU PAY THEM, CHARLIE? NEXT TIME I GO SWIMMING, I WANT TO BE IN A POOL. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. SHERWOOD, THEY WERE USING YOUR HEAD AS A PLUNGER. IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE THIS THEORY. REPTILES LIKE REX FEED ON THE WEAK AND DEFENSELESS. OUR FEAR IS THEIR NOURISHMENT. CUT OFF THEIR FOOD SUPPLY, THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT. WE'RE THE SMALLEST KIDS IN SCHOOL. I MEAN, WE'RE LIKE WALKING SMORGASBORD HERE. YOU'RE RIGHT. OUR ONLY HOPE IS SOMEONE EVEN WHIMPIER THAN US GETS TRANSFERRED HERE. [ Together: ] NAH. WHERE'D YOU GET THE MONEY? MY DAD. YOU STOLE IT? NO, I TOLD HIM ABOUT REX. HE GAVE IT TO ME TO GIVE TO HIM. HE DID? YEAH. HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO SEE THEIR FOLKS OR TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL? NO, MY DAD'S NOT BIG ON CONFRONTATIONS. [ Humming ] OH, STAN. COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EVALUATION OF THIS BY WEDNESDAY? SURE. SHHH! HERE HE COMES. DON'T LOOK SUSPICIOUS. SPEIGEL. PETERSON. HOFFS. [ Computer beeps ] SO, SPEIGEL, HOW'S THIS CULLY LEAF-BLOWER THING DOING? I WAS JUST BEGINNING THE EVALUATION. GOOD LUCK WITH IT. THANKS. [ Chuckling ] AHHHH! [ Laughing ] [ Grunting ] [ Grunting continues ] CAN I HELP YOU? UH, UH... DAD! HEY! [ Annoying chuckle ] DAD, WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR EAR? MY EAR? OH, IT'S SHAVING CREAM.

YEAH, WHAT ABOUT MARTY'S? DON'T THEY MAKE GOOD FRIES? WELL, THEY ONLY SERVE CURLY-CUES. HEY, I LIKE CURLY-CUES. YOU CAN'T DIP 'EM, DAD. YOU GET KETCHUP ALL OVER YOUR HANDS. USE A FORK. YOU EAT BROCCOLI, YOU USE A FORK. CARROTS... A FORK. BUT FRENCH FRIES, YOU EAT WITH YOUR HANDS. BOY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO SENSITIVE ABOUT YOUR POTATOES. DO YOU HAVE ANY BAD FEELINGS BETWEEN YOU AND ONION RINGS? DAAAAAD... [ Chuckles ] HI GUYS. WHAT CAN I GET YOU? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO CHEESEBURGERS. ONE MEDIUM-RARE WITH NO ONIONS, ONE WELL-DONE WITH EXTRA PICKLES, TWO ORDERS OF STRAIGHT FRIES, AND TWO CHOCOLATE SHAKES. UH, IT'S IN YOUR LEFT POCKET. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? WELL, YOU WAITED ON US LAST WEEK. YOUR HAIR WAS TIED BACK WITH A RED RIBBON. YOU REMEMBER MY HAIR? CHARLIE HAS GOT A MIND LIKE A STEEL TRAP. I THINK HE COULD EVEN TELL US THE NAME OF... OUR OLD NEIGHBOR'S PET GOLDFISH. I'M IMPRESSED, CHARLIE. I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT I HAD FOR BREAKFAST. I SEE YOU USE FLUFF AND FOLD FABRIC SOFTENER. IS THIS SOME KIND OF ROUTINE? WELL, I WAS JUST REFERRING TO, THE SPOT ON YOUR UNIFORM. BECAUSE FLUFF AND FOLD, IT USES A SOIL SUSPENDING AGENT THAT CAUSES WHITES TO COLORIZE, AND THEN SOMETIMES THEY TURN BLUE. MY DAD WORKS IN CONSUMER RESEARCH. HE KNOWS THESE KIND OF THINGS. SO A LITTLE BIT OF BLEACH WILL JUST LIFT IT RIGHT OUT. YOUR WIFE MUST LOVE HAVING YOU AROUND THE HOUSE. MY MOTHER'S DEAD. I'M SORRY. UH, I BETTER GET THOSE BURGERS STARTED. [ Sigh ] SO, HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY? IT WAS OK DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER RUN IN WITH THE BULLY? REX. SOME KIDS CALL HIM VINCENT. WHY IS THAT? HE'S THE VAN GOGH OF BLACK EYES AND FAT LIPS. SO, WHAT HAPPENED TODAY? WELL, I PAID HIM LIKE YOU SAID. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, CHARLIE. A LITTLE MONEY IS NOT WORTH GETTING BEAT UP OVER. YEAH. [ Dad, muffled: ] ALL RIGHT. READY? YEAH. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN BEFORE THE TSUNAMI HITS. THERE'S ONLY ONE TRAIN AND THERE'S CERTAIN ITEMS THAT YOU CAN BRING AND CERTAIN ITEMS THAT YOU CANNOT BRING. OK. ALL RIGHT. MR. SIMONS TELLS THE CONDUCTOR HE'S GONNA BRING PEPPER, BUT NOT SALT. AND THE CONDUCTOR LETS HIM ON. OK. THEN, MR. HUGHES SAYS THAT HE IS GONNA BRING AN APPLE, BUT NOT AN ORANGE. AND THE CONDUCTOR LETS HIM ON. NOW, YOU WANNA GET ON THE TRAIN. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BRING? PEPPER, BUT NOT SALT. AN APPLE, BUT NOT AN ORANGE. HMMM. I THINK I GOT IT. I'M GONNA BRING SUPPER, BUT NOT LUNCH. AHHHH! WORDS WITH DOUBLE P's! YOU OWE ME A QUARTER. [ Gargling ] YOU KNOW, CHARLIE... YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE YOUR MOTHER DIED. WELL, YOU KNOW, DEATH ACCORDING TO WEBSTER APPLIES TO SOMEONE WHO ONCE HAD FUNCTION OR USEFULNESS BUT NO LONGER DOES. MOM GAVE BIRTH TO ME, SO THAT FALLS UNDER FUNCTION, RIGHT? UH-HUH. WELL, AS FOR USEFULNESS, SHE WALKED OUT ON US, BUT WE STILL MADE OUT OK. WE HAVE MADE OUT OK, HAVEN'T WE, DAD? YEAH. WE'VE DONE JUST FINE. DAD, THOSE GUYS AT WORK AND THAT SHAVING CREAM... CHARLIE, I TOLD YOU IT WAS NOTHING. I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT... I MEAN, WE JUST MOVED HERE AND, WELL... SHERWOOD'S MY NEW BEST FRIEND AND, YOU KNOW, HE'D BE PRETTY UPSET IF I HAD TO LEAVE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE AGAIN, ARE WE? CHARLIE, WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. RAPUNZEL. WHAT?

[ Indistinct chatter ] [ Whispering ] GET ALLISON. ALLISON NOT CHARLIE. ALLISON. WHY DID YOU PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE HUMILIATION? I WANTED TO PLAY. I HAVE THIS THEORY. ACTUALLY, I BORROWED IT FROM DARWIN. IT'S CALLED, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST." YOU SEE, LIFE IS ONE BIG COMPETITION. THE BIGGER AND STRONGER SPECIES ALWAYS WIN OUT OVER SMALLER, WEAKER ONES. SOMEDAY, THE EARTH WILL BE ABSENT OF ALL THOSE WHO ARE PHYSICALLY INADEQUATE. WE'RE A DYING BREED, CHARLIE. THEN HOW COME BOBBY FERRIN GETS TO PLAY? BECAUSE THEORIES AND TAX SHELTERS HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON-- LOOPHOLES. HIS FATHER WAS A BIG FOOTBALL STAR IN COLLEGE. BUT HE'S A WORSE ATHLETE THAN I AM. DOESN'T MATTER. YOU KNOW THAT BIG CLASS PICNIC NEXT SATURDAY? YEAH. WELL, THERE'S A FATHER-SON COMPETITION. POTATO-SACK RACE, TUG-OF-WAR... THINGS LIKE THAT. YEAH, SO? SO, LAST YEAR BOBBY AND HIS FATHER CLEANED UP. WON ALL THE FIRST PLACE RIBBONS. NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO BE HIS BEST FRIEND. [ Sighs ] THERE'S SAMANTHA. OH, SHE'S SURE EASY ON THE EYES. WHISTLE BAIT, MOST DEFINITELY. HEY, SHE'S TALKING TO HIM. WHO? BOBBY. SAMANTHA'S TALKING TO BOBBY! HER LIPS ARE MOVING. HIS LIPS ARE MOVING. YES, THEY'RE TALKING. MOST DEFINITELY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A CONVERSATION. I TRIED TALKING TO HER ONCE. MY DAD'S A DENTIST. SHE TOLD ME GO RINSE. WAIT TIL SHE NEEDS BRACES. BOBBY GETS TO PLAY KICK BALL AND TALK TO SAMANTHA SANDRICH ALL BECAUSE HE AND HIS DAD WON SOME STUPID RIBBONS AT LAST YEAR'S PICNIC? THE WORLD'S AN IMPERFECT PLACE, CHARLIE. [ Charlie: ] ONE, TWO, THREE, GO! OHHHH! DAD, YOU'RE NOT CONCENTRATING. NOW, LOOK. THE SECRET TO THE THREE-LEGGED RACE IS TO FUNCTION AS ONE. ONE MIND, ONE BODY. YEAH, BUT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? I DUNNO! I MEAN, I'LL DO IT AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE. FORGET IT. IT WAS JUST AN EXPERIMENT. CAN'T WE PLAY MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING? [ Man: ] ALL RIGHT. THREE MORE. COME ON. THREE, TWO, ONE. ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

I WANT YOU TO BE MY DAD FOR THE FATHER-SON COMPETITION AT MY SCHOOL PICNIC. DO I LOOK LIKE I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BEING A DAD? I JUST NEED YOU FOR THE COMPETITION. ONE AFTERNOON. NO EMOTIONAL STRINGS ATTACHED. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BEAT IT BEFORE YOU GET YOURSELF HURT, KID. MARK! GET OVER HERE WITH THOSE PLATES! AHHHH! I, I'M SORRY. I'M REAL SORRY.

WELL, CHARLIE, IT'S TOUGH. THERE ARE GUYS LIKE REX EVERYWHERE. YOU TRY TO AVOID THEM, BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T. THEY WON'T LET YOU. BOY, DO I KNOW THAT. SO YOU EITHER GOTTA TAKE THEIR STUFF OR YOU GOTTA STAND UP TO THEM. I ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULE. WHAT RULE? NEVER GIVE ANYBODY ANYTHING THEY DON'T EARN. ONCE YOU DO, THEY BECOME LIKE A TICK ON A HOUND, SUCKING AND SUCKING 'TIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT OF YOU. UNDERSTAND? YEAH. COME ON. IT'S GETTING LATE. I'LL TAKE YOU HOME. OH, UH, JOE? I ALMOST FORGOT. WEDNESDAY'S CAREER NIGHT AT SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, PARENTS COME AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DO. AND I, I WAS WONDERING IF... I'LL BE THERE. GREAT. AH, HOW ABOUT 7:00? 7:00 IS GOOD. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU THERE. OK. TAKE IT EASY. ALL RIGHT. BYE BYE, JOE. KEEP ICING THAT LIP, HUH? OK. CHARLIE, WHAT HAPPENED? DID SOMEONE HIT YOU? MY LIP HAS AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO BARE KNUCKLES. DOES IT HURT? NO, IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT FEELS. DAD, WHERE ARE YOUR GLASSES? DAD, ARE YOU WEARING CONTACTS? YES, I AM. WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY... YOU GOT THIS OVER MONEY, DIDN'T YOU? WELL, NO. ACTUALLY, MACARONI SALAD. IT WAS THAT BULLY AT SCHOOL, WASN'T IT? YEAH, REX. HEY, YOU GET THE FEELING HE DOESN'T LIKE ME? CHARLIE, I CAN GIVE YOU MORE MONEY TOMORROW AND HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE. NO, NO, NO. I CAN'T. WHY NOT? WELL, BECAUSE THE NEXT WEEK HE'LL JUST WANT MORE, AND MORE THE WEEK AFTER THAT. I'VE MADE A DECISION. I'M NOT GONNA PAY HIM ANYMORE. CHARLIE, FIGHTING DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. NEITHER DOES LETTING A BUNCH OF BULLIES KICK YOU AROUND. IF YOU WON'T BRING YOUR DAD, HOW ABOUT WE SHOW THEM HIS PHOTO FROM THE FAMILY ALBUM? NO. OK. WHAT ABOUT A DOCUMENT WITH HIS BICEP MEASUREMENTS? I COULD GET IT NOTARIZED. WE HAVE TO FACE THEM ALONE. WE'VE GOTTA TAKE A STAND. THE STANDING PART DOESN'T CONCERN ME. IT'S THE FALLING DOWN I'M WORRIED ABOUT. WHO ARE ALL THOSE KIDS? MR. FINNY'S SCIENCE CLASS. THEY'RE DOING A PAPER ON THE PAIN THRESHOLD OF THE MALE SPECIES. SO THEN WHY ARE THEY FOLLOWING US? FIELD RESEARCH. [ Beep ] WHITNEY, WHAT TIME DO SCHOOLS USUALLY GET OUT? Around 3:00, sir. OK, THANKS. [ Children whoop & holler ] [ Sherwood: ] NOW I KNOW HOW CUSTER FELT AT LITTLE BIG HORN. [ Charlie: ] COME ON. LOOK, OUR ENTIRE CLASS IS HERE. MAYBE THEY'RE HERE FOR MORAL SUPPORT. HEY, RALPHIE. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? I CAME TO SEE THE BLOOD BATH. YOU'RE A TRUE FRIEND, RALPHIE. [ Laughing ] WE'RE DEAD MEN. YUP. WE ARE. CHECK IT OUT. I TOLD YOU HE'D SHOW. WELL? DISH IT OVER. TODAY, SPEIGEL. I'M NOT PAYING YOU, REX. [ Rex's friends snicker ] WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID, "I'M NOT PAYING YOU." NOT A NICKEL. NOT A DIME. WHAT IS IT? YOU EAT YOUR WHEATIES TODAY, LITTLE BOY? LOOK. I OWE HIM. NOW YOU PAY HIM OR YOU'RE TOAST. WELL, IS HE PAYING ME OR WHAT? CHECK HIS POCKETS. HEY, PUT ME DOWN. OWWW... OWWW... [ Moaning ] HELLO, CHARLIE. WHO ARE YOU? LET'S SEE. WHAT'S BIG AS REDWOOD, EATS RAW MEAT, AND CAN SNAP YOU IN TWO LIKE A BREADSTICK? CHARLIE'S DAD. THAT'S HIS DAD? CATCH YOU LATER. SO REX, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? UH, NOTHING REALLY. WE'RE JUST HORSING AROUND. JUST FUN AND GAMES, RIGHT, GUYS? YEAH, JUST FUN AND GAMES. FUN AND GAMES, HUH? SO YOU WOULDN'T GET ANGRY IF I DID SOMETHING LIKE... OH, I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THIS...? [ Hysterical laughing ] [ Whistles ] HEY, CHECK THIS OUT. SPEIGEL'S OUTLINE? YEAH. BUT IT'S GETTING TURNED IN WITH MY NAME ON IT. OH GEE, PETERSON. SHHH! HERE HE COMES. SPEIGEL. OH, NO SPECS. IS THAT A NEW LOOK? COULD I HAVE MY OUTLINE BACK, PLEASE? I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR OUTLINE. HAVE YOU SEEN HIS OUTLINE? SORRY. YOU GONNA TRY THIS AGAIN? THAT'S MY OUTLINE. UH-UH, SPEIGEL, THAT'S MY OUTLINE! MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR GLASSES BACK ON. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A PROMOTION TO ACCEPT. PETERSON... LOOK, YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. GIVE IT BACK, NOW. STAY AWAY FROM ME, SPEIGEL. WELL, I'M WARNING YOU. OOOOHH... YEAH? HERE'S THAT REPORT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON. I CERTAINLY HOPE IT MEETS WITH YOUR SATISFACTION. THANKS. THAT'S A LOVELY TIE YOU'VE GOT ON, MR. WHITLEY. OH, YOU LIKE IT? MY NIECE GAVE IT TO ME. WELL, THAT'S LOVELY. YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE A MINUTE. I'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS. AND COULD YOU JUST LET ME KNOW IF MY IDEAS ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AAUGH! [ Coughing ] MR. WHITLEY! YOU IDIOT! I'M SORRY, MR. WHITLEY. LOOK AT ME! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME? I DIDN'T DO THAT! WHO ELSE IS IN ON IT WITH YOU? I DON'T KNOW. THAT WAS NOT MY IDEA. I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE! OUT OF HERE! HI. HI. HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT? GREAT. THANKS. WHERE'S CHARLIE TONIGHT? HAVING DINNER WITH A FRIEND. THANK YOU. OH, IT LOOKS LIKE HE LEFT HIS LIGHT ON. OH, LET ME TAKE THAT IN THE KITCHEN. THANKS. CAREER NIGHT-- WEDNESDAY-- 7 O'CLOCK. DO YOU THINK WE NEED PLATES? AFTER WE TAKE A DRIVE. IS EVERYTHING OK? YEAH, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DRIVE. WOULD THAT BE OK? WELL, SURE. SO, IT'S LINES, DESIGNS, AND A LOT OF CREATIVITY. IT'S ARCHITECTURE. AND THAT'S MY JOB. THANK YOU. [ Applause ] CHARLIE. [ Microphone squeaks ] HI. I'M CHARLIE SPEIGEL AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY DAD. HE'S AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT THE BROKERAGE FIRM OF BEAMAN AND COMPANY. AND HE WORKS ON MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. THANK YOU, AND... DAD... [ Applause ] HELLO. I'M CHARLIE'S FATHER. I WORK AT THE BROKERAGE HOUSE OF BEAMAN AND COMPANY. AS HE SAID, I AM AN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. EXCUSE ME. CHARLIE? WHAT'S GOING ON? CAN I HELP YOU, SIR? YEAH, YOU CAN HELP ME. WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND YOU ARE? I...I... I'M CHARLIE'S FATHER. CHARLIE? YEAH. HE'S MY DAD. [ Audience murmurs ] YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS GUY'S A RINGER? THAT'S GENIUS! [ Sigh ] I, I... YOU KNOW, DAD, I'M REALLY SORRY. LOOK, CHARLIE, LET'S TAKE ROSE HOME AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU. I SAID, LET'S TAKE ROSE HOME FIRST AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. OK. ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU GO UPSTAIRS. I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE. [ Doorbell rings ] MR. SPEIGEL? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO ARE YOU? I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. CAN I COME IN? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? MR. SPEIGEL, I KNOW THIS LOOKS TERRIBLE, BUT IT REALLY IS A MISUNDERSTANDING. CHARLIE CAME TO MY GYM LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO GO TO A SCHOOL PICNIC WITH AND I VOLUNTEERED. OH, YOU VOLUNTEERED TO BE HIS FATHER? NO... THIS WHOLE THING HAPPENED BECAUSE... I'M A GUY THAT WALKED OUT ON HIS OWN KID A LONG TIME AGO. YEAH? AND,...I GUESS I FELT THAT BY HELPING CHARLIE, SOMEHOW IT WOULD EASE MY OWN GUILT. HELPING HIM WITH WHAT? I MEAN, WHAT DOES HE NEED HELP WITH? DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT ME? CHARLIE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT YOU. OH, WELL, OBVIOUSLY HE FOUND ME UNACCEPTABLE, AND YOU LOOKED LIKE A MARVELOUS ALTERNATIVE. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE CHARLIE I KNOW. CAN I SPEAK WITH HIM A MINUTE? NOT TONIGHT. HE CAN ONLY DEAL WITH ONE FATHER AT A TIME, AND TONIGHT HE'S GOING TO BE DEALING WITH ME. SO FOR TONIGHT, IT'S, "GOOD EVENING." DAD, I, I'M SORRY. STOP APOLOGIZING AND TRY TO TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WHAT IS IT? ARE YOU... ARE YOU ASHAMED OF ME BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD AT 3-LEGGED RACING? WHAT IS IT? I, I... WHAT? BECAUSE HE'S A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN? DAD, CALM DOWN, PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO WIN THE RACE. I WANTED TO BE MORE POPULAR. I WANTED TO BE MORE LIKED FOR A CHANGE. I HATE ALWAYS BEING THE KID STUCK AT THE END OF THE BENCH. IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ONE AFTERNOON, JUST TO WIN SOME STUPID RIBBONS. AND IT GOT OUT OF... ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, CHARLIE. LOOK. SEE, I HAVE MY OWN QUALITIES. I CAN'T CHANGE WHO I AM. I MEAN, ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T RUN. I CAN'T... I MEAN, I'M NOT BIG AND STRONG. I'M NOT A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN. OBVIOUSLY, YOUR MOTHER THOUGHT I WAS A... I THOUGHT YOU WERE PROUD OF ME. [ Sherwood: ] CHARLIE, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? YEAH, SURE. WHAT KIND OF SLIPPERY, CONNIVING, REPTILIAN MIND COMES UP WITH A SCAM TO BRING A RINGER TO A SCHOOL PICNIC? LOOK, SHERWOOD, I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS ANYMORE. ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M ONLY MAD I DIDN'T THINK OF IT MYSELF. SHERWOOD, I DID A BAD THING. I LIED TO YOU. I LIED TO JOE. BUT WORST OF ALL, I HURT MY DAD. HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME. THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO ALL OF THIS, YOU KNOW. WHAT? I HAVE THIS THEORY. YOU'RE BORN. YOU LIVE. YOU DIE. SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE, YOU GET YOUR 15 MINUTES OF FAME. WE'VE HAD OURS, AND WE'RE ONLY 12. HI YA, CHARLIE. HOW YA DOING? HEY, LET ME GO! AAUGH... [ Phone rings ] HELLO? JOE-JOE. WE GOT OURSELVES A SITUATION. MY ATTORNEY TELLS ME I'M NOT GETTING DASHLUBE. I TOLD HIM NOT TO WORRY. YOU'LL FIX IT. NO-CAN-DO, MR. TURNER. IT'S OUTTA MY HANDS. I ANTICIPATED YOU MIGHT PLAY BOY SCOUT. SO, I GOT MYSELF A FLOATER. HELLO, JOE, IT'S ME. CHARLIE? DO THE RIGHT THING, JOE-JOE. NO ONE WILL GET HURT. FRANK, THE COMPANY'S BEEN SOLD. THEN UN-SELL IT. [ Knocking ] [ Doorbell ringing ] COME ON! I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- CHARLIE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE POLICE? WE CAN'T. THEY FIND OUT WE DID, THEY'LL DISAPPEAR-- WITH CHARLIE. WHY DO THEY WANT MY SON? IT'S NOT HIM THEY WANT. FRANK TURNER'S A GANGSTER. HE RUNS AN ELABORATE MONEY-LAUNDERING SCHEME. HE USES LEGITIMATE COMPANIES TO WASH HIS MONEY FROM HIS SHADY VENTURES. HE WANTS A COMPANY I REPRESENT. AND HE'S USING CHARLIE TO GET IT. WELL, THEN GIVE IT TO HIM. I CAN'T. IT'S BEEN SOLD. I KNEW HE WOULDN'T GIVE UP SO EASY SO I TRIED TO GET SOMETHING ON HIM. WHAT'S THIS? WHEN YOU ACQUIRE A COMPANY, YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE ALL OF ALL YOUR ASSETS. I COULDN'T ACCESS FRANK'S FILES, BUT I'M SURE THAT'S WHERE HE KEEPS HIS 2nd SET OF BOOKS. I WASN'T ABLE TO GET IN, BUT IF I HAD, I COULD NEGOTIATE. ARE THE FILES PASSWORD PROTECTED OR ENCRYPTED? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, MAYBE I COULD GET IN. THERE'S NO TIME. WE GOTTA FIND CHARLIE. BUT THERE ARE A MILLION PLACES! WELL, WHEN YOU GOT THE RIGHT COMPASS, IT'LL LEAD YOU TO IT. I'M CALLING THE POLICE. NO, YOU CAN'T. WHAT? YOU CALL THE COPS, THEY'LL SEND AN ARMY. THESE PEOPLE DON'T REACT WELL TO CROWDS. HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THEM? I USED TO BE ONE OF 'EM. [ Snoring ] [ Metal clanking ] AH, AH, OH! GO, GO! DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING? I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT. [ Laughing ] [ Indistinct talking ] [ Man on phone: ] YEAH, OK. CALL ME BACK. CALL ME BACK. 15 MINUTES. GIVE MY LOVE TO YOUR FAMILY. SOMEBODY OPEN UP! COME ON! SOMEBODY OPEN UP! OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN UP! HEY, JOE-JOE'S IN THE BUILDING. LET'S GO! OK, KEN. WHOEVER YOU ARE... LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN ACCESS. MR. TURNER. JOE-JOE'S HERE. HE'S SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING. [ Computer beeping ] [ Turner ] Find him! I want him now. FINGERS, DON'T FAIL ME NOW. ACCESS DENIED? DON'T DO THIS TO ME. DON'T DO THIS TO ME. [ Loud clanking ] [ Man: ] SOMETHING'S GOING ON DOWN BELOW. SPREAD OUT! [ Panting ] LET'S GET HIM! LET'S GO! WHERE YOU BEEN? I JUST GOT UP HERE AND I'M STAYING UP HERE. LET'S SEE HOW TOUGH YOU ARE, BABY. [ Beeping ] [ Computer voice: ] Welcome to CRG Network. Enter user name now. LOAD CYPHER9. HERE WE GO. [ Beeping ] BREAK THAT BABY. BREAK THAT BABY. COME ON. PIECE OF CAKE. SEAL IT OFF! IT'S JOE. HE'S IN THE CHUTE. HEY, CRISCO! SEAL OFF THE CHUTE ON TOP. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WENT UP OR DOWN. GRIFF! EDDIE! SEAL OFF THE BOTTOM. I'M ON LEVEL TWO. WE'VE GOT THE BOTTOM COVERED. H... ALL RIGHT. N! AHHHH. OH! [ Yelling and screaming ] COME ON. BINGO! YEAH. AVAST YE LUBBERS. STAND BY TO BE BOARDED! NOW WHAT DO WE... GAMBLING? OH, MR. TURNER. I'VE GOT YOU NOW. [ Indistinct chatter ] SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR PRECIOUS FILES. YEAH, YEAH, GREAT. SIT DOWN! I SAID SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! JOE-JOE. YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD. NOT EATING ENOUGH GREENS? LET THE KID GO. AND GET RID OF MY INSURANCE POLICY? I DON'T THINK SO. COME ON, FRANK. DO IT FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE. DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH, JOE-JOE. [ Speigel: ] 56, 57... WE'RE HALF WAY THERE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE THOSE MEGABYTES. COME ON, COME ON. THAT'S IT! [ Door opens ] [ Man's voice: ] HEY, YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I TOLD YOU. DASHLUBE I CAN'T GIVE TO YOU. IT'S ALL READY SOLD. THAT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR, JOE-JOE. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. IT MAKES ME LOOK BAD IN FRONT OF THE STOCKHOLDERS. I'M AFRAID YOU LEAVE ME LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO TERMINATE OUR RELATIONSHIP. LOOK WHAT I FOUND. DAD... I'M ALL RIGHT, CHARLIE. AND WHO ARE YOU? I'M STAN SPEIGEL, I'M CHARLIE'S FATHER. LOOK WHO WE GOT HERE. CHARLIE BRONSON-- FRISK HIM. HE'S CLEAN. TELL ME, STAN SEAGULL... SPEIGEL. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING THROUGH THAT HEAD OF YOURS TO JUST WALK IN WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A PEA SHOOTER? WELL, MR. TURNER, WE EACH HAVE SOMETHING THE OTHER PERSON WANTS. I'VE GOT YOUR KID. WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE OF VALUE THAT I WOULD WANT? WELL, I LOGGED ON TO YOUR COMPUTER, AND BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND IN CRYPTOGRAPHY, I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR PROTECTED FILES. YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT UNCLE SAM WAS INTERESTED IN. AND THEN I SENT A COPY OF THE FILES TO A FRIEND OF MINE, AND I TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IF HE DIDN'T HEAR FROM ME IN ABOUT, WELL, IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES, HE SHOULD TAKE THE FILES TO THE NEAREST D.A. YOU'RE BLUFFING. YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET IN. WELL, DOES THE WORD "HANNAH" RING ANY BELLS? WHO'S HANNAH? SHUT UP. THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE GOT HANNAH. AND I'VE GOT YOUR SON. STOP THE COMPUTER NOW OR YOUR KID IS HISTORY. [ Beeping ] WHERE ARE THEY? THEY'RE IN A SAFE PLACE, AND IF YOU LET US GO AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO US, THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GONNA STAY. á[ Chuckling ] WHERE'D YOU PUT THE FILES? OH, I SENT THEM TO A SAFE PLACE. DO YOU TRUST THE PERSON YOU SENT THEM TO? OH, I THINK SO. WHO'D YOU SEND THEM TO? WELL, I SENT THEM TO MYSELF, ACTUALLY. OH. OH. GOOD THINKING. WELL, GOOD BYE. UMMM, JOE, I'M SORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ALL THIS. FORGET ABOUT IT, KID. COME ON, CHARLIE. YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYBODY. YOU REALLY OUGHT TO GO SEE YOUR SON. I HEARD YOU THE OTHER NIGHT. YOU KNOW, CHARLIE, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS. I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO SEE ME. MY MOM, SHE LEFT ME WHEN I WAS 2. AND I TELL EVERYONE SHE'S DEAD. BUT AS MUCH AS I SAY I HATE HER, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN. WELL, BYE, JOE. GOOD BYE, CHARLIE. DAD. I'M SORRY. I WAS ONLY THINKING OF MYSELF AND IT WAS VERY SELFISH. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'VE HAD A LONG DAY AND WE'RE BOTH TIRED, SO LET'S GET SOME SLEEP. OH, NO. CHARLIE NEEDS THIS TODAY! CHARLIE. THE PERSON WHO I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE WHEN I GROW UP. THE PERSON I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE WHEN I GROW UP IS NOT A FAMOUS ATHLETE. HE DIDN'T HIT ANY HOME RUNS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 9th OR WIN A GOLD MEDAL AT THE OLYMPICS. HE'S NOT A FAMOUS PRESIDENT AND HE DIDN'T INVENT ANYTHING. HE'S NOT EVEN A CELEBRITY. THE PERSON I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE WHEN I GROW UP IS JUST AN AVERAGE EVERYDAY GUY I HAPPEN TO KNOW. YOU SEE, WHEN HIS WIFE LEFT HIM, HE GOT STUCK RAISING A KID ALL ON HIS OWN. WHICH MEANS YOU GOTTA GO TO WORK TO PAY THE BILLS AND DO THE GROCERY SHOPPING AND BE ON DIAPER DUTY. THAT COULD CUT INTO SOCIAL LIFE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT HE'S A TERRIBLE COOK. I'D NEVER TELL HIM THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS. HE'S THE BEST PERSON I KNOW BECAUSE HE DOES THE THINGS THAT COUNT. LIKE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT HIS SON HAS TO SAY. NOT LIKE SOME GROWN UP WHO PRETENDS TO LISTEN TO YOU. BUT HE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND. SOMEONE YOU CAN JUST TALK TO. I KNOW THE PERSON I JUST DESCRIBED DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ANYONE SPECIAL, BUT HE IS TO ME. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE MY... MY DAD. CHARLIE! DAD! I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED THIS. CHARLIE, YOU DON'T REALLY HATE MY COOKING, DO YOU? WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.
