The Big Chief Why on Earth are you looking at me like that? I don't recognise your face. You've seen it before. We've worked together for 20 years. Never, in 20 years, I've never seen you look this worried. Me, I look "worried?" Yes. Perfectly. The vitreous eye, the soft lip, the collapsed zygomatic... "My collapsed zygomatic?" Oh, no. Now, you're exaggerating. What is this "zygomatic"? A facial muscle. "Facial?" A muscle of the face, if you prefer. I only have to look at you to see that you're getting yourself down. I'm not getting myself down, but the more I think about it... You can't go through life without thinking after all... Listen to me Paolo. I saw a movie about the abduction of children. Every time, the kidnappers give themselves away. In real life, It's different. The leading role was played by "Jame St√©ouart"... "James Stewart." No, then it wasn't him. I know what I mean... I tell you I've got it all worked out, nothing left to chance. Like your little classified ad had nothing left to chance: "The shy, become chiefs" "Explanatory note C.O.D.." It's a long time since you brought that up. I'll bring it up as much as I please. Because the one that got treated as a swindler, was me. The one that got punched in the mouth, was me. You, you weren't there, when he came, the shy one that wanted to become a chief. I'd set up another business. Ah yes. Raising snails in my room. Another of your schemes. I ruined myself to feed them, and once they were good and big, they set sail. The whole building stuffed themselves on snails for a week. The whole place reeked of garlic from the 5th floor to the ground floor. Enough to knock you down the stairs. No. You see, Paolo, you're very intelligent, you went to school, you know Latin, American, the zygomatic and heaps of things. You're the brain, I'm only the arm. But today, the arm tells you no. Farewell, Ali. Hello, Omar. Good... Let's remain washers of cars, since your ambition stops there. Let's see, let's see. It is pretty, isn't it? But 2,5 millions... Unfortunately, we don't even have 250,000 francs in savings. And the river passes right behind? Yes. That must be a good corner, for fishing. Surely. Only, 2,5 million francs... Yes. Say, Paolo... Suppose... Just suppose : if we take the child, you won't hurt him? Hell, you take me for a monster? As for the father, he's rich enough. For him, 2,5 millions isn't anything. You think so? The products of Jumelin Beauty, the Jumelin brillantine, creams, soaps... "Jumelin toothpaste gives you the smile of a cherub." he doesn't even know how many zeros he has to his account. And his car? I could make four cars out of one like that. And his posh hotel, avenue Victor-Emmanuel, his racing stable... I planned it all meticulously, I'd noted the comings and goings of the child, of the parents, of the servants. It's all in here. We could've been rich. You don't want to. Too bad. I didn't say that I didn't want to, I said that it could be dangerous. You are going to follow me, you are going to obey me. Yes, Paolo. Everything will be fine. You remember, the car? It's a 'Versailles'. I left it just in front of the garage. You can't miss it. You'll take the key from the office, below the picture. It's the third one from the left. "Third one from the left." Yes, Paolo. Hello, Miss Rose. Hello. Don't you have your account? Yes, yes. Are't you coming back on Monday then? No. My friend and I are thinking of changing profession. We want to settle to our account. Goodbye, miss. Goodbye. You seem strange. Me? Why would I seem strange? I am very normal. Maybe it's you who's being ... strange. Goodbye, miss. Goodbye. You scared me. You take the Versailles. I'll wait for you at the crossroads. What... Pardon me, sir. It's nothing. It happens to me too. These cars all look alike. Is yours black as well? Blue gray, a neutral colour... These type of cars ... the colour looks different when they're washed. Good day sir. Excuse me. Ah, at last! Well, you took your time. Faster, faster. We must get to the Wood before the youngster. But the parents are going to be worried. It's necessary that they are worried. If they aren't worried, they won't pay. Yes, that's true. It'd be necessary nevertheless, to reassure them. Of course. We'll invite them to dinner one evening. Ah yes? Say Paolo, what if the child doesn't want to follow me? I have the necessary. What is it? A narcotic. It's chloroform. "chloroform?" Isn't that dangerous? No. You pour some some drops on your handkerchief and you apply it to the child's nose and they sleep. Clueless! Hot-head! "hot-head", to me? That one then ... Pay attention, good God. I'm paying attention ... "Clueless", that again ... But "hot-head" ... There? Look! Eric! Eric, enough! You're going to hurt someone. Boys of this age have need of turbulent games. It seems to me that we've met before. You always seem so melancholic, so mysterious. Me too, seems to me I've met you before. Eric? Aren't you black Eagle? If you want. And you, who are you? Subtle fox. Delighted. - Back! You are a dirty Comanche. I am an Iroquois. Your tribe are enemies with mine. - No, listen... There you see, how it is between Redskins. You've broken something of mine, Calm fox. "Subtle!" No, no. Listen... Our tribes were enemies, but propose to make the peace. To bury the axe of war? Yes, that's it. We're going to "bury the axe of war." Good. Take me to your wigwam. Where's that? - To your wigwam, your house. We are going to smoke the pipe of peace. That's it, we'e going to smoke the pipe of peace. Do have you one? - Yes. Truly? Nothing is truer, you'll see. Come. Already? The time passes so quickly with you. I have to leave you. See you soon. Maybe. You're terrible, I don't even know your name. Eric? Eric? Eric! Oh! A satyr! - No, these are Indians. Indians? Hot chestnuts, hot! A tiny little cone sir? - No, thank you. If the big chief is willing to enter the wigwam of his brother black Eagle. Hello, Antoine. - Hello. How's it going? - It comes, it goes ... What's that? - It is my nephew. He's come to stay for a few days. Oh that's better. He frightened me! I didn't know that you had a nephew. Me either. Finally, I knew it... Did he swallow his tongue? - Don't you say hello? Say hello to the lady. Hello, pale face! - Yes, yes... You know, chldren nowadays... They have a little fun. You pitched your tent so high to better keep an eye on the valley? Yes, that's it. It's to better keep an eye the valley. Stop here. Go on. Is this it, your wigwam? Of Course, compared to your wigwam, this must seem very small to you. Oh lord, the chloroform! I am going to fall. Black Eagle, what's the matter? I don't know... Antoine? What's happening? Antoine? Where's the youngster? - What youngster? The Jumelin boy? He was with you, wasn't he? I don't know, I'm sleepy. - I'm going to wake you up. I'm going to wake you up. - It's your narcotic... Breathe well, breathe strong. Get down from there. - No! Dad, there he is, over there! I see him. Little hooligan! Is he yours? - No. Yes. Finally, he is ours without being ours. Go and get him. - How? Go and get him. - You want... Go. - Don't shoot, hey. Attention. Listen... Let's go, let's go... Raise your leg... Come down from there. - Come and get me. Bunch of little brats! You little rascal! You're going to pay me for the damages. Don't get in a state, sir. We are both civilized people. I'll make a complaint to the police. We'll pay you. Yes, we'll pay. Let me know the estimate. Why did you do that? - I don't like windows. Evidently... It's a silly answer. Who is this? - This is my friend Paolo. He seems like a window. - No, no... Come see what I bought you. Here ... here ... here ... What did you do with the car? I abandoned it in an empty lot. You didn't have any problems With the youngster? He doesn't realize anything. - You kidnapped me. No. What an idea! I like to be kidnapped. More than lessons. I'm on holiday. In a sense, he's right. You're not tying me up? Don't talk crazy. Here's the appetizer. Do I eat like I do at home? - Naturally. One, two... three. Are they good? - Luscious. Not too much oil? - No. Not too many bones? - Not too many. Emjoy. I'll prepare the next course. What are you doing? Do you drink wine, at home? - Yes. With water? No. Pure. Paolo, can you give pure wine to a child? I don't care. Let him drink water. Especially as the water is excellent, in this district, much better that in the 8th precinct. Hang on. Who is it? - The police. Already? You must be mistaken. We should flee through the window. - Yes. It would be so funny! What is it? On behalf of Dad, for the windows. He asked for an estimate : that makes 13 700 F. "13 700 F"? We didn't bombard a cathedral. If you don't pay up immediately, Dad's going to make a complaint. You will say to your father that... What is it that I should tell him? You will tell him that we are going to pay immediately and without delay. Dirty toad! It's nothing, it's nothing. But it's nothing. Quiet, I'm getting to it. It's suprising, how well that holds. I am going to pull your head off. - Yes, pull his head off. The neighbors would complain. I'm going to tell Dad. - No, you're not going to tell him. We're going to give you a gift. What do you want? - A fire engine. A fire... A fire engine? Ah, a small car, a toy? Paolo, in your opinion, how much does that cost? 1 300 F. - Devil, devil... With the big ladder, or without the big ladder? You're not funny. - You hear, Paolo? I'll find you on the warpath. Be quiet! 13 700 and 1 300... That makes 15 000, all together. Here it is. Goodbye, my child, and say hello to your father. If you see anything else that you'd like, come and tell me and I'll buy it for you. You, you go... Oh, my cutlets. I'm afraid that they're overdone. I don't want to embarrass you. No, I don't want to embarrass you. Give Antoine a cutlet right now. Give a cutlet to Antoine. Do you hear? Give Antoine a cutlet! Still, there's nothing for me? There must be discipline, otherwise... Hey well... Do you see how he is? He would rather choke himself than give you even a little of your share. Question of education. Or a question of stomach. Go get the bananas. I'm going. They don't feed this child. Here are the bananas. Paolo? What's happening? - We're being attacked. Every man to his post! Make him be quiet, Antoine. - Shut up. Listen, Fragile Fox... "Subtle" Fox. - Yes, if you like. Calm down, the attack is repulsed. Black Eagle, I go to my tent, and you're going to keep watch. As you say, yes... I'll keep watch... Black Eagle, you're not keeping watch. Keep watch, so he gives us some peace. What are you doing? - I'm keeping watch. Black Eagle, who is it that makes the stars shine? I don't know. Black Eagle, what makes the stars shine? "What makes the stars shine?" Say, Paolo, what makes the stars shine? The stars, what makes them shine? I don't know. You see, he doesn't know. We'll look in the dictionary tomorrow. - No, immediately! My God, what am I going to do with you? Is it finished, this comedy? I need to sleep! You don't speak, you hiss. False brother. You are called Eye of snake. Eye of snake is a dirty type Eye of snake is a dirty type My God, he lies down there. The Seine has its source at the plateau of Langres. 7 times 7, 49. Charlemagne was crowned emperor of west in the year 800... Eye of snake is a dirty type Eye of snake is a dirty type Ouch! - What is it. What's going on? I ate too much. - With me, that evens out. I think I'm really ill. What is it? My God... Paolo! The child is sick. No! That's all we need. He's not fooling. He doesn't look good. How do you feel? - I want to be sick. Where does it hurt? - In my stomach. From top to bottom or bottom to top? From right to left. More on the right? -Or more on the left? On the left. - On the left... No, on the right. It isn't more serious. Paolo... We need a doctor. - It's not possible. Why? - In our situation... We can't leave him like that. We're going to take care of it by ourselves. If I gave him a good drench? - Maybe. Wait... All microbes are in here. - Ouch, I feel ill! Stick out your tongue. Inflamed tongue... Pain to the right side. Appendicitis... Here is! "Essential signs : "violent pain in the right iliac pit, "to the point of Mr Burney, "on the right of the umbilicus and of the crest of the hipbone. "Nausea, elevated temperature, fast pulse, "frequent nervous disorders of the child..." It's good, this. - You first. Me? - Yes. No... - Yes. It's good. There. Who's this for? - You again. Ah, no. - Yes. Ah good? If. For me. "Replace the ice..." The treatment is very simple. Especially, no purgative. "No purgative." Ice on the stomach, it says. If it says so ... - What are you waiting for? Ice! Ice... I'm going to look for it immediately. All the caf√©s will be closed. Put a compresses of cold water on him, while he's waiting. It wasn't true. I'm not sick! It wasn't true. I'm not sick! Excuse me, do you have any ice please? Certainly, vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, mocha? No, appendicitis. It's for a patient. Pardon me, I couldn't know. Go along on the right to the bar, it might be open. Thank you sir, and good luck with the bread. What is it? What do you want? I'd like some ice. It's for a patient. Oh! What's wrong? The child has a pain to the right side. I thought that he had appendicitis. I wanted to give him a purgative... Oh, purgative... I was told that it was necessary to have ice. I'd like a piece of ice. Like that? A bit bigger. How much is that? 200 F. Here. Hey, hey! There's no need to knock so hard. Maurice? Maurice? - Eh? I saw an enormous block of ice that went down the staircase. Yes, my love, a block of ice, from the North pole. The floe, the icebergs... Enough. Enough, take your drops, my dear. It's all I could find. It's still too much. How is he? - He will explain it to you himself. There, repeat what you told me a little while ago. It wasn't true. I'm not sick. Hey well, that's a relief, because... What? It wasn't true? You'd deserve it if I gave you a slap. Let's smoke the pipe of the peace. You lie down now. Black Eagle, you are kind, but Eye of snake, is a traitor. Say, what makes one sneeze? "What makes one sneeze?" If I tell you why I'm going to sneeze ... No. What is it? What are you laughing at? Idiot! Oh yes, you're so great. Listen to me. Let's take stock: 13,700 F, for the windows, 1,300 F for the fire engine with the big ladder, 3 sardines with oil, 2 cutlets, 10 kg of ice, in addition to that a cold, maybe the same Asian flu, that turned the house upside down and a neighbor who wants to make a complaint. It's going well, your idea. Good grief... Have a drink, it'll calm you. If you give me wine tomorrow, I'll tell you a secret. No. Do you hear? No wine. And no gestures. Paolo shouts. Black Eagle? Black Eagle? - Who's that? Hey? I scalped Eye of snake at dawn. What? I scalped Eye of snake at dawn. You "scalped Eye of snake at dawn?" Yes. Very well. This child is terrifying. He scalped Eye of snake. "Eye of snake?" But that's Paolo. Paolo? Paolo? Did you sleep well? Yes, very well. You didn't have any bad dreams? No. That makes me very happy. I'm going to tell you something, but don't be angry... That wouldn't do any good. Especially as it quite suits you. And as it soon grows back. What? What's this... Dirty vermin! Don't hurt him, we have to return him. Let me deal with him, I can be harsh. Why did you cut Paolo's hair? Look at how little he has left now. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You deserve a slap. Here. And another one. Here! I'm even go to punch you. Don't hit him so hard, you're going to knock him out. It's a good thing you stopped me. This kid, he drives you crazy. We need to finish writing the letter! What "letter?" - The letter to his parents. I'd completely forgotten. I'll read it back: "Sir ...." It's a little dry. If I put "dear Sir?" Can I have the string? - No. Why do you always have to antagonize him? Let him have the string. Take it, my child. "Sir, your child is in our possession..." Possession, with two "s?" - Evidently. That makes four of them then. Four "s" for only one word, it's a lot, that. Go on, go on. You should trim what remains. That'd even it up. "We present to you the following conditions: "you will pay us 2,5 millions..." No! 2,7 millions. It's gone up? Exactly. "2,7 millions, "that you will leave tomorrow ..." "That you will leave tomorrow" "behind the picture 'The Angelus' of Millet," "in the Louvre." That brings us to "The Angelus"... "The Angelus" of Millet," It's a stroke of genius. Simple. You wouldn't understand. Carry on. "If you involve the police," "you will never see your child again." Ah no! I'm not putting that. It's a figure of speech. Underline the last sentence. "Your child..." "Otherwise your child..." Hey, hang on... "...will be back at home the same evening at 8 o'clock." "Your child will be back at home the same evening at 8 o'clock..." Signed... "Two men prepared to do anything." "Prepared to do anything"? Me, I'm not prepared to do anything. It's better if the recipient doesn't know that. This is the address. You only have to copy it. Avenue Victor-Emmanuel. Where are you going? - To post the letter. Think so? For the important things I trust only myself. Dr Koltz's clinic. I'm listening, sir. Yes? An ambulance for 17 h 30? Very well. Room 220. Yes, I've made a note. Room 228, please? First passageway on the left, all the way to the end, sir. Let's see if I've got this straight, first passageway on the right? No sir, on the left. Why did you do that? What's up? - Paolo. Paolo? Who's is it? Hello, Paolo. - Hello. What did they do to you? Did they hang you by the foot? Doesn't allow you to move. It is a device, a continuous extension to avoid the shortening of the leg. "A continuous extension?" Ah good. You look good. Does it hurt? No, I'm having fun! It's insane how good a time I'm having! You see, I didn't spare any expense: the best clinic, your own room, as if you were a millionaire already. Also, you have a pretty balcony. That you can enjoy, from time to time... Did you mail the letter? Yes. They must have received it by now. It was Eric's idea to bring you the oranges. How thoughtful of him. Give him the oranges. - No. Tell poor Paolo what you told me before. I have nothing to say. Let me remind you, you told me that you regre... that you regretted... That you had ... For ... for ... forgotten to remove the rope. You have to encourage him to repeat what he said. He is so shy. -Don't trouble yourself. Do you have the newspapers? Yes, but I didn't have time to read them. Pass them to me. And you, leave us a moment, go have fun in the corner. Is there any mention? Rather. Hang on, look. - What is it? A photo-fit. - Of whom? Of you. Of me? - Yes. That doesn't look like me, not at all. A little, from here to here. Did anyone see you in the Wood? 2 or 3 people. The investigators interrogated these 2 or 3 people and reconstituted your face. The classic stroke. "The classic stroke?" Since it is the classic stroke, Why didn't they make a photo of you? The housekeeper would not have spoken to the police about me. They would've blamed her for having left the youngster on his alone. Everybody thinks that you're the kidnapper. Of course, it falls on me again. This is awful. "The captor is a man of large size, "with broad shoulders, and long arms like a monkey" "and a beastly cad." "A beastly cad?" - Yes. "While Miss Florentine," "the charming and devoted housekeeper," "held Eric by the hand..." She wasn't holding his hand. - Let me finish. He came to me. It's only a detail, but nevertheless. "Holding Eric by the hand. An individual emerged from the thicket," "pounced on the girl," "snatched the child away from her" "and disappeared with big strides while carrying away his prey." They're crazy. They deserve to be put straight. Yes. You should hold a press conference. But you must admit... What? - The youngster. No, he's playing. He's a sweet child. - Raise the bed up a little. What, you want me to raise the bed? - Yes. No! No! Turn the crank. "The crank"... Yes, underneath. No! The other way. Doesn't it surprise you that in all these articles, there isn't a word from the parents? Too upset maybe. I wonder if they're bothered about their son. Can parents that have become so uncaring even exist? We'll see if they remain so indifferent now that they've received our letter. You will go to the Louvre. Tomorrow. I'd prefer to be going in your place. Me too, I'd prefer to be in yours: in continuous extension. You have to stay like this for a long time? A fracture of the thigh, doesn't heal itself in 24 hours. Do you want to see the X-rays? Over there on the table. X-rays? I don't understand such things. - Yes, yes, yes. You'll understand better. Oh l√† l√†! You're missing an important bit. "An important bit" of what? A bit of bone, I suppose. It's him! Stop him! He's shredded everything! Get the pieces. - Where are they? In the garden. Quickly! Of course! The doctor is coming this morning. Pleased with yourself? You pulled another of your pranks? I'll remember all this, when I'm back on my feet. You will pay dearly for every prank. Put down those scissors! - Ask me nicely. Put down those scissors, I tell you! No ... Don't do that, Eric. I beg of you, my child. Eric ... Antoine! Eric, don't do that. I beg of you my child. Eric ... Antoine! Do something. Do something? Do something? That's easy for you to say! Eric, come help me. No, anyone but him! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! What's happening? - Signalling error. The X-rays, quick. Doctor don't go. No, this goes, this goes ... No, no. Try it with yours. Hang on. It's nothing. Look, that would make your leg zigzag. There, the problem's fixed. Try not to move about anymore. You're not a child. Thank you, gentlemen. He'll behave himself, wont you? He is going to be very good, little Paolo. Where's the youngster? I don't know. Find him immediately. - Is it really necessary? With him go our 2,7 millions. "Go?" - Yes. Eric? Come quickly. Come on. Come. Eric, You must promise me you'll be good. Because I have an errand to run. Why don't you take me? Are you going to see Eye of snake? No, you're mistaken. You know, the more I think about it, the less I like Eye of snake. When his hair grows back, I'll scalp it again. Why didn't you scalp me, while you were about it? - I like you very much. You are kind like a horse. - "A horse?" I'd like to stay with you forever. Don't go getting such ideas in you head so quickly. Provided that Dad doesn't put the money behind the picture. What picture? "The Angelus" of Millet. I heard everything. My God, he heard everything. This way, boys. I am subtle Fox. And you? Who're you? We're from the neighborhood. What do you want? I'm locked in. Let me out. We don't have the key. You don't need a key. Find something to demolish the door. I am going to look for my Dad's box of tools. Yes, fetch your Dad's toolbox. After, I'll teach you a bunch of stuff. Excuse me sir, I've come to see "The Angelus." Down there and on the right. Excuse me, I've come to see "The Angelus." Second booth on the right. Yes. In French. What transparency and what purity! The hues are sombre, and yet there is such a wealth. One would like to stand behind the canvas to discover the secret of its radiance. You see ... I wanted to see the radiance... Colour... Hey boys, watch this. Maurice! - What? Maurice... I saw an Indian! Of course, of course you saw an Indian, a big Indian. No, quite a small Indian. Of course, lots of Indians. And now, you're going to take your drops. How did you get out? - Through the window. Why not through the door? - You'd locked me in. That's true. But that could've been dangerous. You'll listen to what you're told. Don't be angry, I've got a surprise for you. It that us or is it the Eiffel tower? *...separates you from 2 million. I'd like you to answer that. Black Eagle, I present you Hair of bison, Pensive buffalo, Agile deer, Wild cat and Beak of vulture. Listen to me, Beak of vulture, Wild Cat and Pensive Buffalo : This whole menagerie can clear off immediately. Black Eagle has more words than brains. What did you say? - They'll clear off after. After what? - After the big feast. Because you plan to organize a big feast here? Tonight, subtle Fox has invited his brothers to celebrate the fourth moon. My God! "The fourth?" The parents of your brothers expect them home for dinner. They've asked their parents permission. The gray heads agreed. The gray heads maybe, but not me. That's enough, go home! If you make them leave, I'll tell them everything. What, "everything?" - Everything. Let's be serious. Listen to me, big chiefs, promise me, that after the feast, you'll go back home. YES, SIR! Call me black Eagle. "Royam amannah." "Royam amannah." "Royam amannah." "Royam amannah." Royam amannah! Royam amannah! Royam amannah! Royam amannah! What is this, a bomb site? Where is my son? I don't know, look for him. Etienne! My God I didn't recognize you. Who's painted you up to look like that? It was you! What was me? You've got a cheek! What do you see on my face here? Listen Hair of bison, tell the squaw a little something about who did this to me. Shut up! - Shut up? Who's going to clean this off? Before you say any more; I've provided a great feast. That's just a burnt-cork 'tattoo' to celebrate the fourth moon. You have the effect of a full moon on me, you do. Come, Etienne. Carrying on like this at your age... I'd advise you to take off, before your parents arrive. Go, run along, run along... Go, go. That's not yours. Oh, my God! Paolo. Well, "The Angelus?" Still nothing. - It's bizarre. And at the house, how's that going? It's very lively. We have a lot of guests. You know Eric. Well, multiply the "making", and the "fetching"... by "six". There is Agile Deer, Hair of ... of Bison, Patient Vulture and ... Buffalo ... sleepy. Excuse me, it's been four nights since I closed my eyes. Then ... you see ... Paolo, Promise me you wont be angry. I've done something terrible. Terrible but necessary. Antoine, you didn't? Don't tell me that ... Yes, Paolo, I've just done it. I left him at the door of his house. Are you mad? Maybe, but if you knew how much better I feel now. No more noise, no more worries ... I'm finally going to be able to sleep. sleep ... sleep ... Is he yours, this child? - Yes! Hello, black Eagle. - Hello ... What're you doing back again? - I took a taxicab. With what money? That makes 2 320 F, without the tip. "Without the tip?" I suppose you did the tour of France on the way here? The tour of the clinics. Your son didn't remember which one. My "son?" Ah, yes ... How much did you say? - 2,320 F. Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. Goodbye, little one. He's cute. - Very cute. Goodbye, gentlemen. See you again. Why did you do this? - I get bored all alone. It's more fun With you and your friend. That's true. We cry with laughter. If you want him to look after you, be sensible. I will be sensible. When are you coming back to the house? Tomorrow. - Are you better? Not quite. I still need plenty of rest. You understand what that means, plenty of rest? The big chief drank your words. Well then ... Tell me paul, at what age do they grow out of crap like this? You said a bad word. You will be punished. The intellectual development of a child doesn't necessarily follow its physical development. That aside tell me, with Eric, playing Indians, how long is that going to last? Until he's 13 or 15. Suddenly I don't feel so good. What's wrong? - I need to sit down. That's better. Eric, What are you doing? Come here where I can keep an eye you. Now! Antoinne, We asked for too much. - You think so? Yes. - Don't touch that! We're going to send a second letter. You'll find pen and paper in that drawer over there. Fine. Who said you could touch that? Ready? "Sir .... "Taking into consideration the present financial difficulties," "we agree, unusually" "to return your son to you" "in return for the sum of ..." "1,5 million." "this is our final offer." "This is our final offer..." Final ... maybe. "We must be in possession ..." "We must be in possession ..." With four "s." "In possession of the money" "tomorrow by 5pm." "Of the money ..." No! - Don't you agree? No, it's him. - He didn't do anything. He was about to. Did you inhale too much? That's it. "By 5pm." "In which case," "your son will be returned you safe and sound at 8pm this evening." "At 8pm this evening." "Place the envelope ..." Wherever you want, but not behind "The Angelus." What have you got against "The Angelus"? I'm begining to know it by heart. The guard looks at me in a funny way. He surely takes me for a maniac. Okay, if it makes you happy we'll change museum. Write; "Please go to the Gr√©vin wax museum," "to the group of Bonaparte at Malmaison." "Slip the envelope" "in the right pocket of Napol√©on Bonaparte." "Signed: two desperate men." Paolo. - Yes? Now that we're alone, I can tell you: that's it. What? I've just had an interview with Napoleon Bonaparte. he had something for us in his right pocket. Where is this something? - In my left pocket. Didn't you open it? - Not in the street. It isn't heavy. 1,5 million in banknotes, that'd be bigger. It's very thin. Ah, it's a cheque. Open it, you ass. The "ass" is going to open it. That's all? - I think so. Nothing else in the envelope? Nothing. - What's it say? It's typed. Well? Well really! That's just great! - What? Guess. - Pass me the letter. Let me read it to you. It's absolutely beautiful. You listening? - Yes. "To the two desparate men." "I received your letters concerning the ransom" "that you demand to return my son to me." So far, so good. "But I still find your last price a bit high." You'll see. "And I have honor to submit you" "a counterproposal that I hope you will accept." "A counterproposal?" Hang on. "You will bring Eric back to my house yourself" "and you will pay me, in cash" "a sum of 232,000 F." That's what it says? "You will pay me?" And why 232,000 F? It's insane! It's contrary to all custom. You shouldn't let him do that. But if it keeps him busy, it gives us time to think. 232,000 F... All our savings. To the last, 232,000 F, it's not a huge amount. This man could have asked 2,5 million francs. What are you saying? Most certainly. It's his right. Where would you have got the 2,5 millions, if he'd asked for it? Double fool! It's not him that kidnapped our child, it's us that kidnapped his! Ah, yes. That's true. But listen, I'm going to tell you something : this child, if we kept him, he would cost us more than 232,000 F. Because with him expenses, they quickly mount up. Wait and you'll see, the bill from the clinic and all of the small damages. And that one, facing, he made us pay 13,700 F for windows. He didn't even have them replaced. If Mrs. Jumelin would like to come and see? My beloved child. I'd know him anywhere. Alain, come see. Charming! Adorable. - My God! I am going to faint. No, no. Relax. Is this going to last a long time, this comedy? This makes 3 days that you're there watching. I paid you for 3 days. What are you complaining about? I hadn't foreseen this much inconvenience. I don't feel comfortable with all this anymore. You want additional compensation? Certainly sir, it's only natural. After all, without us you wouldn't have found Eric. Hardly 2 hours after, you were alerted. If you'd counted on the cop... I am not a cop, I am a private detective sir. Sooner or later... - Alright, alright. There. Now, leave us. They wear me out! What are we going to do? Don't you think they've had enough now? No, no, no you don't. Let me see them again a moment. Eric's enjoying himself. Besides, so am I. For once the whole family's happy. By the way... Here's your cheque. We're even? - Perfectly even. 232,000 F. Alain, Alain... Think of my heart. If you'll just have a little patience? Think about mauve pigeons against a white sky. I'm thinking of it, I'm thinking of it. Hello? Black Eagle here. Are you Antoine Patureau? - Himself. This is the voice of your conscience speaking to you. Paolo, it's the voice of my conscience. The voice of my conscience... - No big words. The voice of my conscience has come to bother you. Down. Say, you should remove those ridiculous rags. Yes, you're right. But how do you know that I have these rags on me? Since I am the voice of your conscience. Yes... you're right. Why do you scratch your head? Paolo! What is it? My conscience phoned me. Are you kidding me? - I assure you. What did it want, your conscience? - I don't know. My God, here it is again. Don't answer. It is me again. - It's there again. Hello? Hello? It is not you that I want to speak to, it is Antoine. You're holding the receiver upside-down. Then, it's settled. You will bring the child back to his parents tonight at 8pm. Count on me. And you will pay 232,000 F. About the 232,000 F, is it still necessary... Because... we... we, are nice people. You ask us for 232,000 F, but we, we haven't got as much as that. Yes, yes. Don't listen to your friend, who's making signs. It's right. Why are you making signs? Don't sit down. Listen, about the 232,000 F, maybe we can manage somehow. You see, people of good will, always end up getting along. So, until tonight. You know the address. By the way, don't leave Eric to play with the catapult. Here. You told me that you wouldn't take me back. Be reasonable, you know that we can't keep you with us. I don't want to go back home. I'll be bored without you. Me too. But we'll see each other again sometimes. Why can't you come and live at my house? Live with you? Well you see, I'd never thought of that. Are you willing? - Yes, I'm willing. And you won't ever leave me? - Never. Come on. Hello, Jules. - Sir.. Say... was that you? It was me. Dad! Mom! - My child. How you have have suffered, my love. It's him. He's called black Eagle. It's him that kidnapped me. "Kidnapped"... There's no need to exaggerate. He's come back. Goodnight, Subtle Fox. -Goodnight, Black Eagle. It's nothing. - Oh, I know. Do you have the money? Yes. Here it is, sir. And 12 that makes 32. We are even. Enter. The staff have asked me to ask you ... whether master Eric is definitely back in the house. - Evidently. In that case, if sir will permit me to take the liberty to warn him: me, whatever happens, I won't leave sir, but Marthe and Joseph have decided to leave. Marthe, I understand. But why Joseph? Let's see, sir ... Remember, last week ... Scalped? - Yes, sir. At dawn? - Yes, sir. We'll sort that out later. You can go. I should be going too. One moment. I know that you have become attached to my son and that my son has become attached to you. We have become very attached to each other. I don't want to deprive you too brutally of his company. It's very kind of you. He will come to see you every Sunday. "Every Sunday?" No thanks are necessary, it's the least I can do. I'm even going to make you a present. What are you doing? I give you half of the 232,000 F. "Half"... I'd prefer 116,000 F in whole banknotes. A little patience. Every Sunday, Eric will return to you half a banknote. Little by little, You get your money back. 5,000 F per Sunday, it is... Take it or leave it. I'll take it. Say, Mr Jumelin, I wanted to ask you... for starters, you don't think that one Sunday out of two... No, I don't think so. - You don't think so. If you don't think so, then that's how it is. Make like I do. Because sometimes here... depending on which day it is. - Yes, it depends. So, did it go well? It went very well. You, you seem to be yourself again. What makes you say that? Nothing but the look on your face, I guess that you gave him all of it. What, "all?" What does that mean? The 220,000 F of our savings and the 12,000 that you had. Hang on ... Look. Antoine, I congratulate you. No, no. - Yes, yes. I would not have believed you capable of such a stroke. You see, you never let me. What is it? - I don't know. It's this. My friend... Well? - Well, my old... It's the trumpet. -"the trumpet." My God! Of course, he reads. Can I turn out the light? - Yes. Morning, Paolo. - Morning. Beautiful day, hey? A pity that the child isn't here. I would have taken him for a walk. Just to break some windows in passing. Don't be mean. I know you, if he came back now, you'd welcome him with open arms. This is precisely what I told Mr Jumelin. What did you say? - Nothing. He'll only come on Sundays. -"Sundays?" There aren't many Sundays in a year. - There're 52 of them! "52?" Triple idiot! - "Triple?" Well ... When I think that I congratulated you last night. Scream, it'll make you feel better. You are going to return immediately to Mr Jumelin... How's that? You will tell him that he can keep his youngster... What's that? You're a bit hoarse ... That he keeps his youngster! Eye of snake, I will scalp you at dawn. No, Paolo, I assure you that he's become very kind. This last time, he didn't break hardly anything. Black Eagle! - He's softened ... Open the door of your wigwam!
