[♪♪♪] [Christmas music] -[voice-over] My name is Rachel Webb. And I confess, I'm a hopeless romantic. I know, it sounds silly with everything going on in the world. And you'd think by my age, I would have learned by now. But. I just love romance. A few months ago, the most wonderful thing happened. You see, I'm a theatre critic, and there I was reviewing Twelfth Night when the guy playing Sir Andrew caught my eye and, well... I felt head over heels immediately. And we've been inseparable ever since. It's wonderful. And tonight... Tonight, I think he's going to ask THE question. -What do you mean, THE question? I hope you mean whether you would like a martini or some champagne with dinner? -Mum, he's an actor. He can't afford champagne. -Ugh. -No. I mean, THE question. I really think he might be actually about to ask me to marry him! -Oh, good lord! Rachel, darling, I have been trying to marry you off for years. But really, an actor? Come on, you've only known him for two months. Don't you think this is all a little premature? -Mum! Gregory and I are in love! -Yes, and I seem to remember you saying the same thing about the last one. That, um... [sighs] dreary politician. Well, at least he had a real job, I suppose. -Mum. could you at least pretend to be happy for me? -Sorry, dear. [sighs] Of course, I want you to be happy. Look, maybe you should marry this one. After all... [chuckles] you're not getting any younger. Hmm. -Thanks for the pep talk, Mum. Have fun. -I will.

This is it! [Christmas jazz music playing] [muted conversation] -[whistles] [indistinct]. [background conversation] -Hello, darling! -Ahh... babe. [smacks a kiss] Babe! [chuckles] I got the best news. -Ooh, tell me. -I got the part in Pirates of Penzance at the Coliseum! -Gregory! That is amazing! I'm so happy for you! Is it a big part? -Well, you know, it's. Sort of. Yeah, it's a key role. Yeah, I don't actually have any lines. But they said they might write something in for me. -What? That is still marvellous. - It's good, isn't it? - Yes, yes, yes. [both] Mwah! -I'm gonna have a glass of wine. -Umm, so is there anything else? -What? -Oh, nothing. It's just that in your text, you um, you said that you have something to ask me. -Oh, my gee. Ha! Almost forgot. [laughs] Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody. Um, sorry. Excuse me, sorry to interrupt your dinner. Umm, sorry, but tonight is a very, very important night. I know some of you may recognize me from the West End Theatre. Yeah? Yeah, uh... [clears throat] Anyways, I just found out today that I'm going to be starring in the next production of Pirates of Penzance at the Coliseum. [polite applause] -Thank you. Thank you, yeah. I wanna say I thought this night couldn't get any better. You know, I hope it will. Rachel Webb. You make me feel like I'm a multi-award-winning actor. Which I will be, one day. [laughs] [romantic music playing] -[gasps] -Will you marry me? [romantic music playing] -Yes! Yes, yes, yes. -She said yes! [cheers and applause] -Whoo. -Ohh. - I love you. - I love you. Mwah. [church bells toll] [sighs] This is it! I'm getting married! -[laughs] Darling, I'm so happy for you. Finally, after all this time, [sighs] just when we'd given up hope. -Mum, it's my wedding day. -Sorry, darling. Habit. Oh, you look beautiful. Look, I don't want to jinx it, but you are sure about this? You're my daughter and I love you, but you have only known actor boy for three months. -Mum, his name is Gregory, and it's been three and a half months, actually. -He wasn't very "hands on" with all the planning. -Oh, yeah, yeah, but Mum, he was busy with rehearsals. You know how time-consuming they are. -I just want to make sure you're doing the right thing. -Mum, I am doing the right thing. I love him. And I want a family. I want to be a wife and a mother. -You will make a wonderful mother. [laughs] Oh, come on. -Thank you. -Let's get you married. [laughs] [whimsical music playing] -Here we go. -Oh, my gee. [Rachel] Gregory! Oh, Mum. Wait, you're not meant to see the bride before I get inside the church. It's bad luck! -[nervous chuckle] -Wait, where are you rushing off to? You're meant to be standing up at the altar nervously. -Yeah, right. So, uh... Here's the thing, Rach... You know I love you, babe. I really do. -Oh, I knew it was too good to be true. -I just can't. -No! No! -I was in there waiting for you, and it just didn't feel right. You know what I mean? We barely know each other. We only met like what? Two months ago? -Three and a half, actually. -Really? It's just, uh... You know, I've been so busy with rehearsals, babe, this is such a huge part for me. -You don't have any lines! -Yeah, but they said they might write something in for me. I gotta be standing by, babe. -Let's call Gilbert and Sullivan and ask for the rewrite, shall we? -[panting] Can we go somewhere else and have a chat, babe? -Look, don't 'babe' me! We can talk right here, thank you very much. So, you're telling me that, after I pulled this wedding together in record time whilst you were off practicing standing at the back of the stage being a glorified extra, that now it doesn't feel right? I mean, you told me two days ago that you couldn't wait to get married and have children. What the hell happened?! -All right. Last night, I was having a couple of drinks with the lads... -Oh, here we go. -And I was thinking... I'm an actor, Rach. I need to be free to follow my dreams, and if I'm married and have kids... I think it'll stop the creative juices from flowing through, and I'll never get a great part again. And the lads were saying that everyone knows that behind every great actor is a nagging wife. -Wait, behind every GREAT actor is a NAGGING wife? -Well, that's what... -Well, you know what? You don't need to worry about that any more because A, you're NOT a great actor! And B, I'm NOT gonna be your WIFE! -Babe! -Don't even think about it, actor boy! -♪ Another year Away from home ♪ ♪ What's Christmas day When you're alone ♪ ♪ The tree just lit Its magic... ♪ [phone ringing] -[groans] Pfft. [keypad beeps] [Chloe] Well, finally! I've been calling and calling. -Sorry, I just. Just want to be left alone. -[chuckles] Wallowing in this won't help you, you know. -[sobs] -Oh, darling. I am sorry. He really was a louse, wasn't he? -[sobs] Yeah. I mean, Mum, why me? Why do I always have such terrible luck with men? I'm never gonna find someone to fall in love with. I'm not going to be a mom and never going to have a family. -That's not true. I don't know why you have such bad luck in the romance department. He wasn't the right man for you. You deserve someone magical. Someone that when you look at him, it's love at first sight. -Really? -Really. Now, I know you were supposed to be flying off for your honeymoon tomorrow, and I hate the idea of you sitting there all alone with that depressing little Christmas tree. So I'm offering you two choices. One, you come down and spend Christmas with me. -[sobs] Oh, Mom. [Chloe] Or two. You pack your bikinis and go off on that honeymoon with a couple of your girlfriends. I know you paid for it. Actor boy has no money. It would be a shame to let it go to waste. -No, I just want to curl up here by myself. Forever. [sniffles] [Chloe] I forbid it. Come on now. Some sun, a few cocktails, some girl time. Look, you deserve some happiness, and it'll do you the world of good. -No. [Chloe] Think about it. And don't cry too much. He's not worth it. And no one looks good with puffy eyes. [phone beeps] -[sighs] [sniffles] [phone trilling] Rebecca? I know. He's an idiot. No, I'm fine. Look. What are you and Amanda doing for Christmas? I've got a proposition for you. [upbeat music] So, here I am on what should've been my utterly blissful honeymoon. But, instead of a dreamy week with actor boy, I'm with these two, my two best friends in the world. Truth be told, they're both slightly odd. But they are faithful and loyal, and I love 'em to bits. This is Rebecca, built like a supermodel, but in fact, a nerdy accountant. Never married and claims to never wanna be. And this is Amanda, the most feared food critic in London. Divorced and always on the lookout for monkey business. Over the years, we've been through thick and thin together. So, even though my heart has been shattered yet again, and I am still looking for that missing puzzle piece, this place, this little jewel of an island in the Caribbean, looks beautiful. And I'm gonna try and make the most of it. [camera clicks] -What an amazing view. -Yep, it is, isn't it? -I'm kind of glad actor boy walked out on you! [laughs] [clears throat] Too soon? -Don't worry, darling. You're not going to go through this alone. -Thanks, girls. -[shrieks] Hello!! Hellloooo!!! Helllloooo!! Oh, girls, you made it. I'm sooo excited. Welcome to Belle Mont Farm! I'm Eleanor, the manager. But you can call me Ellie. We're so excited to see you. You're going to have so much fun. Now, which of you is Rachel? -I am. -Aww, we are so sorry for your loss. But we're gonna take great care of you, okay? Let me get your keys. [shrieks] This is gonna be so exciting. -I want what she had for breakfast. [♪♪♪] [Ellie] How do you like this, huh? You've got your own private pool. -[laughs excitedly] [Ellie] Not too shabby, right? Rebecca, Amanda, I put you in those two over there. [Amanda] Whoo. -But this one is the best one, and this one's for you, Rachel. It's my favourite. [all laugh happily] -Come on, let's go. Ladies, are you ready? Welcome home! Ta-da! - [all gasp in surprise] - [Ellie screams] [shrieks] Don't... I am so sorry. I told the staff to clean it up. I am so sorry. -Ellie, don't worry. It's absolutely fine. -Really, it's very sweet of you. [chuckles] -I know, why don't we all go the terrace for a nice cup of tea? And I'll get them to clean it up. [lively chattering] [Ellie] Isn't this fabu? And you're welcome to use the pool at any time, it's so refreshing. And the terrace over there, that's where we serve the meals. The food is amaazing. And we have a pool gym where you can work it all off after if you need to. [chuckles] Isn't it the best? -Yeah. It's-it's perfect, Ellie. -Aww, Rachel. You can really rest and recover here. Let the island heal you. -Hmm. -Knock, knock! Oh, no. I knew that this would happen. -Amanda, I'm fine. -No, no, no. You're gonna put on a sexy swimsuit and get out there in the sunshine. -No, I'm just gonna hang in here for a bit... - [Amanda] No, no, no. I'm not gonna have you sitting in here. Now, come on. Put on this little number. I'll see you in ten minutes. I'll go and get Becca. [birds chirping] [cheerful perky music] Hi. -Hey! Come on in, it's glorious! -Yeah, I... you kids have fun. [chuckles] I'm gonna go to the bar. -You don't want to swim? -Seriously? The sun is not my friend. The bar's in the shade, and they have cocktails. [chuckles] What's not to love? Hmm. - [whispers] I'm coming. Whoo. -Come on, Rebecca! -Noo! [both] Come on! Come in! [Amanda] Come on! Come on! [Rachel] You did it! [laughs] -Oh, you can make it to the bar? Okay. [laughs] -♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year ♪ -Hi. I'm Rebecca. -Hi, nice to meet you, Rebecca. I'm Frank. What can I get for you? -Anything alcoholic. Surprise me. -Coming right up. -Do you have one of those little umbrellas? [chuckles] I like this bar. -Amanda, where are we gonna eat tonight? You're the expert. Find us somewhere good. -Yeah, I'm on it! -Hmm, when you do, can we tell them you're the food critic for The Herald because then we get a free dessert. -I'll buy you a dessert, Rebecca. [Rebecca] Thank you. -Oh, this looks good. The Gin Trap. -Did someone say gin? -Good food? -Yeah, looks like it. -Boy, I love it already. Let's go! -I can never tell if you're hungry or thirsty. -Usually both. [slurps] -Yes. -All right, ladies. Is there anything Sexy Santa can do for you? -Um, well... actually, yeah. [all laughing] [funky EDM music] [engine car revving] -[gasps] Oh, wow! [Amanda] Thank you so much. Aww, lovely. What a view! Amazing. [chuckles] [Rebecca] It's so beautiful! Ooh, look! Gin. [Rebecca laughs] - [Amanda] Ohh! [EDM music playing] -Good evening! Welcome to the Gin Trap. You must be my 8:00 PM reservation for three? -Yes, Amanda Hartley. -Wonderful. I'm Monica, the manager. -This place is beautiful. -Thank you very much. If you'd like to follow me, please. -This place is fabulous. -Thank you. But wait till you try the food. Now, specials are on the back. I can recommend the lobster pasta. It was freshly caught this morning. -Love lobster! -Ooh, Amanda's the food critic for the Herald newspaper back in the UK. -Becca! -What?? I'm just so very proud of you. -A food critic, huh? Well, in that case, I'll let the chef know he'd better bring his A-game. Let me give you a few minutes to look at the menu and then I'll get Tasha to come and take your drink order. -Thank you. Becs, you're impossible! -I'm sorry but you two have the cool jobs. When we come to a restaurant, it's all about you, and when we go to the theatre, we casually drop in that Rachel is the theatre critic, and we usually get free ice-cream. -Yeah, you casually drop it in. We're usually hiding behind a pillar somewhere, dying from embarrassment. - [laughs] - Look, when we go to the accountancy and payroll festival, you can tell them what I do for a living, if you want. And you might get a free pen. -There's a festival for that? -No, but there should be. -Evening, ladies. Can I get you some drinks? - Oh. - Yes, please! -What about a nice bottle of rosé! -Hmm, we have a lovely one from the South of France, perfectly chilled. Are we celebrating anything special? -Umm. [Rachel] Yes. We're celebrating friendship. -Aww. -I do love lobster, so I'm going to go for the lobster. I just... I couldn't work it out. I kept staring at him and suddenly, it dawned on me, I realized... Where I recognized him from... I had been out with his dad just the month before! -No!!! -Yes!! They were both excellent. - [Rachel] Oh! - Amanda, I'm in awe! -I'm divorced, not dead. -Yeah, but you always seem to get the guy. And they're nice guys! -Hm. -That's because I let them know who's boss and they love it, and I can't help it if they find me adorable. -You are adorable. [laughs] [Alessandro] I see you all talking. [speaks in foreign language] - [man] Good to see you. Thank you. - Oh, you're a lucky man. You enjoy the dinner? [speaks in foreign language] Everything okay? Dinner was good? -[chuckles] [Alessandro speaks in foreign language] -[chuckles] -[speaks in foreign language] Welcome, ladies. -Hello, my name is Amanda. -[speaks in foreign language], Amanda. I'm Alessandro, owner, and head chef, at your service. -It should be illegal to be so handsome and cook. -Amanda! I'm so sorry about my friend, I'm Rachel. -Hello, Ra... [romantic music playing] I hope that dinner was to your liking. -Oh... it was amazing. I don't know what you do to that lobster, but it should come with a warning. It's addictive. I can come back every day... For the lobster. -I'll be happy to cook you dinner every day. I notice you didn't have dessert. A chocolate soufflé, perhaps? It's my speciality. -That would be amazing. -It does sound amazing, but unfortunately, we're leaving. - We are? - [Rebecca] We are? - We are. - Really? So soon? You enjoyed dinner? -Oh, yes. No, it's been absolutely lovely. Unfortunately, we do have to go now. Thank you so much. Thank you. [background conversation] Thanks. -[laughs] -What just happened? -I don't know, but I might as well have been invisible. One look at you and the rest of us ceased to exist. -Yeah, Amanda, why did you make us leave so quickly? -Come on, everyone knows when the thunderbolt strikes, you exit. -What?! -Yeah. Come on, everybody saw it. He took one look at you and the angels started singing. -It was practically in slow motion with a soft filter. -Then why leave so quickly? I mean, he was kinda gorgeous. -Absolutely! And you're back on the market. We've got to plan this. Can't have you wandering in willy-nilly. You've got to be prepped. -I'm not sure I want to be prepped. -Yes, you do. I shall teach you my ways. -Well, and is one of these ways just running off immediately as soon as you meet someone? -Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely. Leave him wanting more. He's not gonna be able to stop thinking about you. -She's right. We left so quickly I can't stop thinking about that chocolate soufflé. Come on. -What have I let myself in for? [sighs] I've just met this gorgeous guy. I mean, who would've thought it? Ahh, the way he was looking at me and his accent. Mm, kind of dreamy. I mean, what if... -Hello, you! Oh, don't be sad. Everything's gonna be all right. -Oh, men, huh. -Oh, you don't need to tell me how useless men are. No, indeed-ey. Let me tell you my story. Twenty years ago, I moved to Florida, I met this gorgeous guy. Un-believable! The next thing I know, he's moved in, right under my nose. -Ohh. [chuckles] -All of a sudden, the romance vanishes. Poof, gone. -Aww, sorry. -And not only is he a giant worthless layabout, but he's a conspiracy theory freak. - What?! - [Ellie] Yeah. Starts wearing those tin foil hats and saying the aliens are talking to him through the radio. A total loon! And just when I thought it couldn't get worse... -It got worse?? -It did! I went to visit my sister for a week. One week! I come back, and he's moved his three illiterate, computer-playing, conspiracy-theory buddies in. -Noo. -Good job I had a gun. -So, [stutters] you shot them? -Oh no, I just waved it around and told them if they didn't leave, I would shoot them. Got rid of them. -[laughs] [Ellie] Spooked me out of Florida. and here I am. A little older, a lot wiser. Trust me, I know exactly how men can be. [laughs] You feel better now, right? -Yeah, I do. -Misery loves company. -[laughs] Yeah. -Okay. My work here is done. -[sighs] [crickets chirping] [Tasha] It's a good thing he's got us looking out for him. [Monica] They'll soon realize they're wasting their time. [approaching footsteps] -[sighs] What are you two whispering about? -Oh, just chocolate soufflé. -What?! -I didn't like those British women tonight. Coming in here and practically throwing themselves at you. -[scoffs] They weren't "practically throwing themselves" at me. I was just being nice to the customers. -Sure. Well, it ain't happening. I'm telling you now. I'm not letting some woman who just wants a fling swoop in here and break your heart. Not on my watch, Dad. -[speaks in foreign language] My little, Monica. Always looking out for me, eh? Come on, let's turn in. [speaks in foreign language] -I'll lock up. See you tomorrow. -Night, Tasha. -Good night, boss. [car approaching] [door closes] -Good evening, David. Everything okay? -No problem, sir. He's asleep. -Great. Be safe getting home, okay? -Sure thing. See you tomorrow. -I'm going to bed, Dad. -Monica, I appreciate you looking out for me. But not every woman is out to get me. -Oh please, I may be your daughter, but even I know you're a catch. Night, Dad. -Good night. [♪♪♪] [sighs] [crickets chirping] [fountain splashing] [Rachel] It just looks so pretty. -Oh! There she is. The woman of the hour. How did you sleep? -Like a baby. -Dreaming about Prince Charming, is it? -I dreamed about that lobster pasta. Yes, love. -Amanda, I didn't dream about anyone. Can we just drop it? -Oh, no, no. We can't, no. It is now our mission to set you up with the... Thank you... sexy Italian chef. -I just broke up with someone. I don't think I'm ready. -Darling, you were about to marry a man you'd known for three and a half months. I've got cheese in my fridge older than that. -I don't. [laughs] I mean, [clears throat] she's right, though. You need to get back on the horse. And he's really dreamy. -You know, we don't even know if he was really interested. -Oh, please. Even the lobster could tell. And it was dead and smothered in delicious sauce. -Well, even if I were interested, I am quite capable of finding my own guy, thank you very much, ladies. -[laughs loudly] Sorry, darling. No, you have a talent for picking losers. No, this guy is perfect. He's sexy, he's settled... - He can cook! - He can cook! -You're not gonna give up, are you? -No. -Okay, fine. -Right. We need a plan. -Oops, hello. Sounds like you ladies are planning a coup. -Even better. We're setting Rachel up with the love of her life. -What?! One night on the island, and you find a man. Girl! -No, I just have two very annoying friends who won't take no for an answer. -Okay. So, what's the plan? -Right. We've already identified the target. Now, we need to collate data. Find out his routine. Get to know his habits. And then, we need to meticulously plot an accidental meeting. -Oh my gosh, she is good. So, who's the lucky guy? -Alessandro, the hot chef from the Gin Trap. [chuckles] -That's your target? Oh, such a sad story. You know, every woman on the island has crushed on him at some point. Guilty! But you know what? You are perfect for him. Wait, we've got time. Ladies, grab your things, dress for a workout. I'm going to take you straight to the target. -Oh, God! -I like to get here really early before anyone arrives. [Rachel] What a view. -Oh, just you wait, baby. It gets better. How's that for a view? [♪♪♪] There he is, your dream man. Every morning, he runs down there, and it's so worth getting up early for, I can tell you. - [Rebecca chuckles] -[sighs] Sometimes I come down here with a cup of coffee and just sit and admire. [Amanda] Anyway, back to the mission. -Okay. All you've got to do is jog down there, run along, "Oh, what a coincidence! Fancy seeing you here!" -Oh, I like your style. Let's do this, girls! [all panting heavily] [Rachel] I can't believe you talked me into this. -[panting] I can't believe I'm jogging. I hate to sweat. - Yeah, me too! -[panting] Listen, just remember, be smiley, be sexy. Above all, be smiley. Oh! -Ladies, how nice to see you! -Alessandro, fancy seeing you here! -Hi, Alessandro. -If I knew you were all runners, we could have run together. -[Amanda chuckles politely] Darling? Are you all right? -[wheezing] [Amanda] Do you want to sit this out for a bit? - Okay. - We're gonna have to cut this short. Do you two mind running on alone together? -[Rebecca wheezing] -Why do I feel like we've just been set up? -Yeah, because my friends are great girls, but subtlety is not one of their strong points. -Okay, so shall we jog? -Uh, hey, how about a walk? It's just that I find it difficult running on the sand. -Of course. Let's go. - Good. -So, what brings you to St. Kitts? -Oh, you know, just a girls' holiday. -No. I'm not buying it. There is more. Everyone who comes here for Christmas has a story. So, what's yours? -Well, it's kind of a sad story. -I'm listening. -I was supposed to be getting married, but my fiancé had other ideas. This was meant to be my honeymoon. -That is sad. -Yeah, but you know, I think it was for the best. I actually don't think he's the one at all. -But you were going to marry him. -[laughs] I know, I know. And I know how that looks. But I really thought that by now, I'd be married with children, and. I'm not. I think I loved the idea of being married more than I actually loved him. Ouch. Harsh. Hmm. - Yeah. Well, he left me. -Good point. He's an idiot. Okay? [laughs] -So that is my story. What about you? How come you ended up here? -[sighs] I came here five years ago after my wife died. -Alessandro, I'm so sorry! -I felt the change of scenery could be good. And it's a better way of life here. Plus, the kids love it. -You have kids? -[chuckles] Yes, I have two. You met Monica last night. -Oh, wow. She's your daughter? - Yes. - Well, gosh. You must be really proud of her. -I am. She's just amazing. So grown up for 19. And then, I have a son as well, - Oh. - Rafael. He's seven and wonderful. Just adorable. -How could you let me prattle on about my sad story when... I mean, you really have a sad story. -You didn't get your happy ever after. So, you're allowed to be sad. But not today! Today, you come with me, and you choose your lobster for dinner, okay? - Okay. - Come on, let's go. Good morning, Bastian, how are you today? -Hello! Good to see you. My favourite chef. How are you doing? -[Alessandro speaks in foreign language] -Ah, I see you brought company. -Wow! [laughs] -This is Rachel. A very special guest on the island. She's come to pick out a lobster for tonight. -Hi. -Rachel, welcome to paradise. Now, let me help you pick out a nice fat lobster just for you. -Wow. So, you've got to tell me. What is in that sauce you use? It's to die for. -I couldn't possibly tell you that. Trade secret. I tell you what. Why don't you come a little early tonight at the restaurant, and I'll show you how I make it. As long as you promise not to share the recipe with anybody? -Yeah, rumour has it that all the ladies on the island have a crush on you. -Well, you must be very special because he doesn't bring anyone down here. - Ohh. - [Bastian] Ahh. Here you go! Special lobster, for the special lady. -[laughs] Thank you. - Thank you. - [Bastian] You're welcome. -Bye. You chose a great one. -[exhales] -Well, that's enough yoga. How'd you get on with the sexy chef? - [Rebecca] Yeah, Rach. - [laughs] -I didn't have an asthma attack on the beach so you could keep stumm. Spill. -He's lovely, but. You know what? I just think it's still too soon. [Amanda] Oh, she really likes him! [Rachel] No! -Yes, you do. You've gone all coy. - [Amanda laughs] - Fine, he's fabulous. I mean, he's just... fabulous. -Oh, yes. This is excellent. [Rachel] Well, he's got two kids. You know that manager at the Gin Trap, that is his daughter, and he has a younger son. -Divorced? -Widowed. [Rebecca and Amanda] Aww. -You didn't tell him the real reason we're here, did you? -Shouldn't I have? -Well, now he'll know you're on the rebound. -No, no, no. He's not like that. He is nice. He's really nice. In fact, he's invited us to the Gin Trap again tonight. -Yes! Chocolate soufflé! [chuckles] And the potential for Rachel to live happily ever after. It's wonderful. [Amanda] Yes. This is going very well. Now, gotta wear something sexy. -Okay. [crickets chirping] [Amanda giggles excitedly] -I can't believe I let you talk me into wearing this. It's too much. -It's just enough. -[chuckles] If those puppies don't get us a free drink, I don't know what will. -I can't do this. -Oh, okay. Don't panic. I'll buy us our drinks. -Darling, look at me. It just dinner. It's fine. -Promise? -Promise. You wanna borrow this? [Rachel] Yeah. [sighs] -There we go. - [Rebecca] Ooh. - Oh yes. -That's gorgeous. -[sighs] Thanks, girls. I don't know what came over me. [Rebecca and Amanda giggle] - Oh. Selfie, selfie. - Oh. -Okay. Everybody say lobster thermidor. [all] Thermidor. [laughing] -Go, go, go. Come on. Come on. Whoo. We're back. -Oh. Um... Hello. [chuckles] Hello. -Good evening, ladies. Back so soon? -Hello, again. We're here for dinner. -Oh. Did you book? -Um... no. -Oh, I'm sorry. We'll fully booked tonight. Absolutely rammed. I couldn't possibly find space for you. [Rebecca] Yeah. Looks crazy busy. [chuckles] -[chuckles] -Rachel, you made it! Good evening, ladies. I saved for you the best table near the kitchen. But if you'll forgive me, I will steal your friend away now. I promised to show her something in the kitchen. -Steal away. [chuckles] -You look amazing. -Oh, no. This old thing. Thank you.

And it is so much better here. -I have to say it, girls, thank you. -Oh. We've always got your back. - Cheers. - Cheers. -Oh. [yawns] I'm so tired. Must be all the exercise. I think I'm going to have an early night. -No. Oh, oh. Yes. [yawns] Alessandro, could you possibly give our friend a lift home? -Of course, I'll take good care of her. -Oh. Thank you so much. -Subtle, girls. - Please. - You're welcome. -Good night. -Good night, Amanda. Good night. - [Amanda] Lovely time. -[chuckles] -I like it here. -It's hard to imagine ever leaving. -Why would you wanna leave? It's like paradise. -The company helps. -Monica seems like a very grown-up young lady. -Don't get me wrong, she can be a bit of a handful at times, but she's amazing, considering everything we went through. -Yeah. It must have been terrible for you all, losing your wife so young. I-I can't even imagine. -It was tough. It still is, at times. -Well, I think you've done a really great job. You must be doing something right. -How about giving up being a theatre critic and becoming a sous chef? -[laughs] Well, you know, I may have missed my calling. All those nights wasted, sitting in the back of a dark theatre, reviewing plays. -Must be exciting, though. All these glamorous parties, these opening nights. -Well, it has its moments. But, you know, I grew up in the countryside. I'm not really a city girl at all. In fact, I'd be quite happy living a. Really simple life somewhere, if I were happy. -Are you happy right now? -Very. [crunch of wheels on gravel] Thanks for the ride. -My pleasure. Rachel, if you don't have other plans for tomorrow, why I don't pick you up and then I can show you the island? -On Christmas Eve? -Do you have other plans? -Um... Well, no. Not really. I mean, in the UK, we usually just go to the pub, get drunk and run home to defrost the turkey. -Sounds fun. [chuckles] So that's a yes for the tour? -Definite yes. -Great. So, I'll pick you up at nine. -Right. Good night. -Good night, Rachel. [crickets chirping] [rumble of approaching vehicle] [engine turns off] -[Alessandro muttering] [door opens and closes] Monica, I thought you'd be asleep by now. -And what time do you call this? -I'm sorry. What? -I guess it took you forever to close the restaurant tonight. I would have expected you back ages ago. -[scoffs] All right, Monica. I get it. You worry about me, and I appreciate that. But you are my daughter, and I'm your father. Rachel is a lovely woman, and if I wanna spend time with her, I will. In fact I'm taking her on a tour of the island tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. Oh, if that is okay with you, young lady? -[scoffs] -And now, I'm going to bed. And I suggest you do the same. Good night. [♪♪♪] - [sighs] - [door closes] [♪♪♪] [woman] It's been incredible. -Well, enjoy your breakfast. - Thank you so much. - [Ellie] You're welcome. -Morning, Rachel! -Monica! Hi! I-I wasn't expecting to see you. Everything okay? -Yeah. Something came up and my dad couldn't make it. So, he sent me. -He sent you? -He said you wanted to see the island. I'm here to give you the grand tour! -Okay. [woman] Thank you. I'm really excited. -Have a good one. -Good morning, Ellie! What a beautiful morning! -Alessandro! You're looking very perky today. -It's gonna be a great day. Have you seen Rachel? -Oh, you just missed her. -We made plans. - That's odd. - What? -Monica came by. I saw her talking to Rachel. They got in the car together and took off. -I told her I'll pick her up at nine o'clock. -Oh. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding. They probably off having a lovely time. -[screams] No! [ATV engine revving] Slow down! Monica! Stop! Stop! [screams] - [Monica laughs] [Rachel] [gasps] This isn't exactly what I had in mind! [screams] No! [continues screaming] Stop! [engine dies down] -So, did you like it? -Invigorating. [Monica] Great. Now listen up. I'm telling you now, woman to woman, I'm sure you're a lovely person and all that, but stay away from my dad. -I... I don't know what you're talking about. -Yes, you do. I've seen the way you look at him. And believe me, you're not the first, okay. He doesn't need you. He doesn't need anyone. We've been perfectly fine for the past five years, just us. So, just mind your own business, finish your little holiday with your friends and leave. You hear me? -Loud and clear. [♪♪♪] -Hello. How are you today? - [man] I'm great. - Isn't it lovely? [sighs] -[murmured conversation] -Hey, darling. It's nice to see you out in the daylight, Dracula. You're the only person I know comes to the Caribbean in the winter, doesn't try to get a tan. -You know, if I stayed here for like a year, I'd probably get some sort of colour but. Just a darker shade of pale, so really, what's the point. Anyway, you're seem to be doing enough running around for the two of us. And I don't just mean in the sun. -I don't know what you're talking about. -So that wasn't that sexy barman that I heard sneaking out of your room this morning? -You're entirely mistaken. -Oh, really? -Yeah. He wasn't sneaking. He was crawling. -[laughs] Oh, incredible. [phone pings] Oh, it's Rach. SOS. She's in the lobby. Are you okay? Where have you been? -She tried to kill me! - What? - Who? -Monica, Alessandro's daughter. -That sweet, innocent girl from the Gin Trap? -Yes, that one. She tried to kill me. -How? -She took me on a "sightseeing tour" in one of those death buggies. -A death what now? -You know, she drove like a mad woman. I had to cling to stay on. I nearly got flung to my death. She did it on purpose. She wants me dead. -Well, I can think of easier ways to kill someone, but it's original. -She hates me. She doesn't want me to see Alessandro again. She made that perfectly clear. I mean, what am I gonna do? [groans] -Where have you been?? -I, uh. -I know you took Rachel somewhere. What did you do? [phone pings] -Please tell me you're not doing emails to work. -No, just... something. -Why don't you try booking us on an earlier flight home? -Oh. Come on, it's not that bad. -What if he did send her in his place? I mean, what if this whole connection is in my imagination. And actually, he doesn't wanna see me again. [Alessandro] Hey, Rachel! I'm so glad to see you. -Uh... Well, there's that theory gone out the window. -Hello, ladies. [all] Mm-hmm. -I'm so sorry about Monica. She told me what she did. -Oh, I'm-I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding. I mean, everything's fine. -You said that she was trying to... -She was just trying to show me a different, you know, side of the island. -[chuckles] -Well, I'm sorry. She can be a bit overprotective sometimes. I've spoken to her. - [Rachel] Oh, no, no. I-I don't wanna cause any trouble. -No, you're not. Look, we're having a barbecue at the house for lunch. Why don't you come? -Oh, I-I don't know. [Alessandro] Please. I'd love you to come. You both are more than welcome to join us as well, of course. -Oh. Thank you so much. But I have a date. -Yeah. And you know, it kills me to turn down good barbecue but I have some stuff to do. You should go. -So, it's okay? Why-why don't you come around one? -Okay, I'd love to. -Great. So, it's better I go to get ready the barbecue. See you later. Ciao. [Amanda] Bye. See? - Oh, that's a connection. [laughter] -Well, I mean, it can't be any worse than this morning, right? -No. Just stay away from Monica if she's holding barbecue tongs or anything sharp. Eeeh, eeh. -[laughs] You should go. Smooth things out. But don't wear heels in case you gotta run. - [Rebecca scoffs] - Thanks, Amanda. [laughs] [♪♪♪] Now, that's a Christmas tree. -Come on. Let's go see the kids. Kids. Rafael, this is Rachel. -Hi, Rachel. Have you time to play catch with me? -Ooh. That sounds like fun. Mm. Smells delicious. Monica, thanks very much for the tour of the island earlier. I told your dad how much fun it was. -Sorry if I went too fast. I didn't mean to. -No harm done. -Okay. Let's eat. [♪♪♪] [laughs] Very good joke, Rafael. Bravo. [laughs] -I'm gonna start washing the dishes. -Thank you so much for inviting me. I have had such a good day. [Rafael] Rachel. Can you help me, please? - Oh. - Hey. What do you need, buddy? -I want Rachel to help. I have to write my letters to Santa. Can you help me? -Of course, I can. -Daddy says that I have to be reasonable for what I ask for. -Okay. Well, would you like me to take a look? Okay. Right. Dear Santa. Aww! I think this is very reasonable for a seven-year-old. -It's not too much? I was going to ask for a rocket ship. -[laughs] Well, a rocket ship might be a bit too much. But this is perfect. -Oh, I have one more thing to add. -Okay. -Don't look, it's a secret. -Okay. -Hey, what are you two up to? Hmm? - It's a secret. - Yup. It's a secret. -Rachel, are you coming here for Christmas day? -Oh. Well, I wasn't planning to. -You have to. Right, Daddy? She should come for Christmas. -Yeah, we would love if you spend Christmas with us. -I mean, I'd love to. But, I can't really abandon Rebecca and Amanda. -Bring them. -Please? -All right. I'd love to. We'd love to. Thanks. -Yay! Now, Daddy, go. We're busy. -Okay. [chuckles] -[laughs] All done? - Yup. - Okay. Well, you know what? I think we should take this and put it on the Christmas Tree, so that Father Christmas can find it. -Yes! Let's do it. - Okay. - Hey-yah. -He's a sweetheart. -[chuckles] Do you have to get back right now? -Um. I mean, I'm gonna be meeting the girls later for drinks. But. why? -I was wondering if you would like to go out on a boat? - On a boat? - Mm. -What, now? -Why not? Monica will look after Rafael. And I thought it would be nice to spend some time together, just the two of us. -I'd love that. - [Amanda laughs] - [Rebecca] You're terrible. I can't take you anywhere. Seriously. - [Amanda] Hi. - Try this. Tell me what you think. - [Rebecca] Mm. Wow. -Too strong? -My eyes are watering, and I can't feel my tongue. It's perfect. -Are you trying to get us drunk? -Would you like me to? [Amanda] Um. [laughs] -Amanda, he's um. [clears throat] a little older than you normally go for. -I'm an equal opportunities employer. What can I tell you? -[laughs] Do you think you'll ever get married again? -Um, well, uh. I don't know. Maybe? If I meet someone who has the same appetite for life that I have. But till then. Hello, what's your name? -Winston. -Amanda. -Very nice to meet you, Amanda. -[Rebecca slurps her drink] [sighs] Hmm. -Delicious. Aren't you? -[snorts and chuckles] [♪♪♪] -[chuckles] How am I supposed to go back to reality after this? -It's magical, isn't it? -How does a chef afford a boat like this? Are you a secret millionaire? -I wish! It's my friend, Winston's. He owns the Belle Mont Farm. -No way! Small world. [sighs] This is just. Unbelievable. I feel like I'm in a dream. -The island or...? -I mean, what is this? I've only known you a few days but, I feel like it's been forever. This is insane. I was supposed to be on my honeymoon! Am I crazy? -No, you're not crazy. If you are, so am I. Rachel, the first night I saw you at the restaurant, I don't know what happened, but it just felt so natural. There you were... -Alessandro, I'm supposed to be going back the day after tomorrow. -I'll take it. If that's all we have, I'll take it. All I know is I absolutely want to spend Christmas with you. [♪♪♪] -Let me get you a Pisco Sour. I learned how to make it in this backstreet bar in Peru. - [Amanda] Ooh. - The barman was 80 years old. You've never tasted anything like it. -Hmm. -Quite the man of mystery, aren't you, Winston? -Is that a bad thing? -Amanda has a thing for cute barmen. -Oh, really? -Mm-hmm. Especially ones who know their way around the cocktail menu. -I'm just gonna... get some rest. -Now, let's get serious about this. I like this one. I really liked this one. But the drink I really, really like is this drink. I love this drink. This is my favourite drink. This is the drink I could come on in and just suck and suck it. And I really liked it, please make me another one. Please. -With pleasure, madam. -Thank you. Now, cheers. -Thank you. Thank you for everything. It's. just been a perfect day. -Yes. It really was. [♪♪♪] -Are you sure you don't wanna come in for a drink with me and the girls? -I would love to, but, I have the kids waiting for me at home. -Well, Happy Christmas Eve. -I really have to go now. If not, I will kiss you all night. Happy Christmas Eve. [Rachel] [voice-over] Oh, wow. What a day. I mean, he seems perfect. So kind and sweet. And his kids! He is so sweet with his kids. And it seems like he really likes me, right? What if he is my missing puzzle piece? -Ooh, Rach! Ooh, you're back. I'm here. [Rachel] Hi. Hi. I was just about to come find you, but-but you know what? I just needed a moment. -Are you okay? How was the barbecue? -Wonderful. He is wonderful. -I'm so happy for you. You smell like the ocean. [giggles] What did he cook? -Where's Amanda? -Oh, she's at the bar. She found a new barman, and naturally he's smitten by her. Oh, look, there she is. Amanda! -[gasps] There you are. You thought you could shake me off. But you can't shake me off because I am here. [gasps] You look absolutely glowing. Was it fabulous? -Did you kiss him? -Of course, she didn't kiss him. The kids were there. -Oh, right. Sorry. -He took me out on a boat. Just the two of us. After the barbecue. And it was magical. - Hmm. - [Amanda] She kissed him. [chuckles] - [Rebecca] Yeah. She did. -And he's invited us for Christmas day tomorrow. -Oh goodie! Can you imagine the Christmas dinner that man's going to make? Ooh! - Oh-oh. It's so sweet of him. So, it'll be Alessandro and his kids. And us and ours. - [laughs] - [Winston] Hello, ladies. -Oh. Winston. -Sounds like you could use some bubbles. -Winston, you know the way to a lady's heart. [Rachel] Wait, wait... You're Winston?! I was just on your yacht! -You have a yacht? -Yes, I have a yacht. I hope you had a good time today. Alessandro is a good friend of mine. -Oh, you know what? I had the best time. Listen, we're gonna go for Christmas day tomorrow. What are we gonna do for presents? -That's easy. We have a boutique here at the hotel. I'll open it for you. [Amanda] You can do that? -Yes, why not? It's my hotel. - [Rebecca] What? - [laughs] - [Amanda] It's-it's your hotel? - [laughs] -You-you... you have a yacht and a hotel? -Amanda, I don't know how you do it but... cheers. [all] Cheers! -Wow. Just look at that moon. It's... [all] Magical. [laughter] -Thank you for coming with me to paradise. -Oh. -Happy Christmas. -Happy Christmas. -Happy Christmas. -[sighs] -♪ We wish you A Merry Christmas ♪ -♪ We wish you A Merry Christmas ♪ -♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring To you and your kin ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New year ♪ - [Rachel] Happy Christmas. - [Rebecca] Happy Christmas.

It's just... - What is it, Rafael? -I asked Santa for something else, and I didn't get it. -What was it? -It's okay. Maybe it was too much to ask for. -Aww. Are you okay, champ? -Yeah. Thanks for my presents. [Alessandro] Hmm. -Happy Christmas, Dad. -Merry Christmas, kids. [all] Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, Rachel. -Now, these are my friends, Amanda, and Rebecca. -Hello, Amanda. Hello, Rebecca. - [Amanda] Darling. - Hi, Rafael. [Rachel] And you already know Winston. -Oh, I thought I heard the car. Merry Christmas. [all] Merry Christmas. -What time's lunch? What? [clears throat] [Amanda] So I said, can you get something from the stuffing and I'm thinking a lemon; they came up with a pineapple. [all laughing] -Well, okay. Christmas is Christmas. Right? [Winston] Christmas just brings everything. - [Rebecca] The food is amazing. - [Amanda] Exactly. -Happy Christmas, beautiful people! [Alessandro] Ellie. Merry Christmas, Ellie. I'm glad you could make it. -I wasn't about to miss out on the greatest love story ever. And I want a front row seat. [all laughing] -I forgot the cranberry sauce. -Oh, I'll lend you a hand. -Alessandro, you got enough food here to feed the five thousand. -I got some extra because I knew Rebecca was coming. -[with a stuffed mouth] What?! -Nothing. [all laughing] -These are really good. -[gasps] -[gasps] -Can you please pass the turkey, please. [Alessandro] Aah! [all laughing] -You've ruined everything! [sobs] -Sweetheart, it's only cranberries. -No! It's all ruined. -Why are you so upset? -Because of you! You came in here and you made my dad fall in love with you. And I told you not to, but you did it anyway. And now Rafael likes you too and you're just... And you're just gonna leave and mess everything up. [sobbing] What am I supposed to say to him when he asks where you are after you leave? -I-I... -He already lost one mom! And now you're just gonna leave and forget about him. -Monica, I'm so sorry. I-I didn't think about that. I-I just got carried away. -Oh, you think? -Monica. Your father and I. We haven't even had a conversation about what happens next. -[sniffling] He likes you. I know he does. But he knows you wouldn't stay. -He told you that? -No. But I know my dad. He won't ask you 'cause he's scared you'll say no. -Would you like me to stay? Oh, Monica. Monica, I never meant to hurt any of you. I'm so sorry. I would like to stay. -You would? -I would. If your dad wanted me to. Please don't be mad at me for falling for him. I. I kinda fell for all of you. -But. how could you possibly like me? I've been nothing but mean to you. -Is everything... Oh, my good grief. What happened? -Oh. We just had a little accident with the cranberry sauce. -Oh my. -It tastes good. - [all laughing] - Are you okay? -Yeah. It's okay. [chuckles] -[murmured conversation] -Sorry, everybody. Bit of an issue with the cranberry sauce. -Oh. Never mind cranberry sauce. We're in the Caribbean! Winston says we have to have hot sauce with the turkey, right? -[Winston] Yes, you're right. -I am right. [chuckles] -Everything okay? -Everything's fine. -Guys, Merry Christmas!

End of story. -Monica, it's not that easy. -Look, I may only be 19. But even I can see that you two are made for each other. She would have stayed if you'd asked her. But you were too stubborn or too scared to do it. -She would've stayed? She told you that? -Wow, men really don't get it. Rafael adores her, and I like her. She's in love with you, Dad.
