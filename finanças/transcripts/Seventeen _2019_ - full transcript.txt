NETFLIX PRESENTS SEVENTEEN [engine starts] [woman over PA] Ladies and gentlemen, we will be closing our doors in a few minutes. [distant radio] [alarm beeps] [distant radio] [shaver whirs] [alarm beeps] Three to control. Alarm in the appliance department. -[distant alarm rings] -Shit! Hey! Stop! [coughing] Tarapara. Tarapara. [judge] How many times have you been here, Héctor? Seven. [judge] And what did I say the last time? A lot of things. [judge] The very last thing, before I let you go. That there would be no concessions next time. [judge] And the time before that, what did I say? That there would be no concessions next time. [judge] So, what do you conclude? That you lie. Do you know the difference between right and wrong? My grandmother's heater at the nursing home was broken. [judge] Is that right or wrong? Wrong. And stealing a scooter? And breaking into a mall? And possession of a weapon? And aggravated robbery? You seriously injured a security guard. He hit his head and spent three days in an induced coma. I didn't touch him. It was his fault. Just tell me it’s wrong. My grandma’s spent three weeks waiting for her heater to be fixed. And that justifies anything you do? No, I guess not. I shouldn't have taken the electric shaver. Why am I here? -What do you mean? Aren’t you listening? -Who reported me? Was it my brother? I bet it was you. [judge] Look, this is the Criminal Code. This includes everything you can't do. If it’s in here, it’s wrong. Here. Take it with you to where I'm sending you. Because when you get out in two years, you'll be an adult and you'll have to face all the consequences. So I advise you to memorize it. [bell rings] [woman] Good morning. Let's go. -[boy] It's too early. -[woman] No excuses, come on. -Good morning. Come on, Mario. -Shit. Good morning, Héctor. -[knock on door] -[woman] Good morning. CRIMINAL CODE [distant conversation] Lawyer, share some of those articles, don’t eat them all. -[laughter] -[woman] Hey, hey, keep quiet. And stop laughing. You'll be needing him to get you out of trouble in a few years. [boy] Our asses will be reformed when we get out of here. [man] Stop... think... and respond. Hearing is not the same as listening. Huh? If we follow our instincts, we're making a mistake. This is our toolbox and it's the only way for us to avoid conflict. You have to learn to think, to detect antisocial, automatic thoughts, toxic thoughts, and to eliminate them before they take hold inside of you. [snickering] [man] To change them into sociable and efficient thoughts. [snorted laugh] LAWYER - FAILURE RETARD [man] You're on the edge of adolescence, and soon, without warning, you'll enter adulthood. What's going on here? What's so funny? Eh? Let's see. Héctor, please, sit down. Do you want me to call security? [snickering] [teacher speaking in background] [boy shouts] [man] Motherfucker! -[whistle blowing] -[shouting] [shouting] [boy] There goes the lawyer again! [man] Hey, where are you going? Stop! [shouting and cheering] [man] Hey! Hey! Come on, let's go! [shouting and cheering continues] [heavy breathing] [man in car] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! There he is! Go, go, let’s go! [car horn beeps] [car horn beeps] [car doors slam] [boy 1] Welcome home, bastard. Did you beat your record, lawyer? [boy 2] Welcome back, you dawg! Is this game you've made up really worth a week of isolation? Can you bring me eight rolls of tape? Well, better make it ten. [distant dog barking] [barking continues] [door unlocks] Let's go. [instructor] Keep walking. Good. Keep going, look behind. Good. Okay, good. That's it. Keep going, that's it, look behind. How was your week off? [instructor] Good, good, keep walking. Well? You want to join them? Dogs are for people on the disability ward. No. No, they're for anyone that has trouble integrating. What do you have to do? Take care of them, walk them, play with them, teach them tricks, relate to them... share with them. -Will they stay here? -No. They're coming once a week. I know nothing about dogs. [laughs] That's the point, to learn. They're all taken. I think there's one left. Let's take a look. Shall we? [woman] Thanks. -[woman] Hi. You're Roman, right? -Yeah. -[woman] Can we see the dog that's left? -[Roman] Sure. We rescued him this morning on the way here. [whining] Which article of the Criminal Code punishes cruelty and abandonment? 337. The owners of all these dogs violated Article 337. Why should I learn how to take care of a dog? To learn how to take care of yourself. Are you calling me a dog? [laughs] Kind of, yeah. I was going to give you some crap about identity, but... -No, save it. -Yeah. I'll save it. [Héctor] What's its name? [Roman] He doesn't have one yet. You can give him one. Should we let him out? He's friendly and gentle. He looks like a sheep. [woman] Don't you dare call him that. [instructor] Come on, don't step on each other. Look at the dog. Fran, he knows he's your dog. Come on, look at the dog. Look at the dog, watch the dog. Keep going, keep going. [boy] Look, the lawyer with the retards! He's finally found his place in the world! [woman] What are you doing? Shut up. Get lost, you're just jealous. [instructor] Come on, keep going, keep going. Keep walking, let's go. Come on, keep going. Good, come on, keep going. No stopping. No stopping. [Roman] Héctor. Here, he was waiting for you. Okay. Let's go over there and make a circle. Sheep. Sheep. Say his name and feed him so he'll start learning his name. -[Héctor] Sheep. -[instructor] Good. [instructor] From the head to the tail. Sit. Sit. [instructor] Right there, that's it, good. [Héctor whistles] Paw. Sheep. -[Héctor] Sit. -[instructor] That's it, good. Perfect, great. Come on, Sheep. Let's go. [Héctor laughs] [man on video] Before we start, it's essential for the dog to know how to sit and come here. [dog whimpers] [barking] -You don't want to play? -[dog whines] [Héctor whistles] [dog barks] Hi, hi. CANINE BEHAVIOR Your gums look good, but you have some plaque. [barking] [boy] Jump, jump! You don't want to play? That's okay. I don't want to either. Sheep! [whistles] Hi. Sheep. Stay. Turn around. Good. [distant chatter] [whistles] [whistles] [Roman] You should be happy. -Why? -[Roman] Because he's been adopted. And it's thanks to you. You made him sociable, obedient and affectionate. And now he's finally found a home, an owner. I'm his owner. Héctor, I told you from the start, the dogs aren't yours. They're here to help you, and Sheep helped you, right? And you helped him. Focus on that. You're good at taking care of dogs and training them. Look, we brought you another dog. You can take care of this one. I don't want to train another dog. I want to train my dog. [woman] Héctor. [door slams] [breathes heavily] [shouting] [woman] Héctor, don't. Héctor, wait... -Héctor! -[boy] There goes the lawyer! -[woman] Héctor, stop! -[cheering and whistling] [woman] Stop! Héctor! Héctor! Héctor! Come here! Let's go. -[woman] Good morning. -Good morning. [inaudible] [sighs] [plays gentle music] FOR SALE [cell phone rings] [coughs] Yes? [brother] When did he run away? Yesterday afternoon. We waited all night, in case it was just a tantrum because... he's done it plenty of times, but he'd always give up or come back. Plenty of times? Twenty-one including this time. What for? He prefers to be in isolation, even if it's just a few days, than to live with the others. [sighs] Typical of him. So typical. We had to call Juvenile Hall and the police. No way... He's getting out soon, right? -Yeah, in less than two months. -Then why did he do it? I think... it has something to do with a dog. -With a dog? -Yes. Sheep. Good Lord. That's not the problem, the problem is that it's his birthday in two days. He'll be 18 years old. If he commits a crime after that, he'll be judged as an adult. But if he does it before, even if he's judged as a minor, the judge can put him in a penitentiary. And with his record, it's probable. I would try to make sure he stays out of trouble and comes back voluntarily, which would be seen as spontaneous regret and have less serious consequences. I don't understand. I'm sorry, but... [he sighs] Has he contacted you? No, and he won't. Do you know where he might have gone? He named a dog Sheep? Yeah. Hi. Hi, Grandma. Tarapara. Did Héctor stop by? Don't lie to me, Grandma. You always defend him. He hasn't shown up whining to watch TV and steal your candy like whenever he has a tantrum? No, because he's grown up. He's stopped being a dumbass, right? He's quit his bullshit. Come out from under the fucking bed. Come out, damn it! You're exhausting. Exhausting. What the fuck are you doing here? Visiting Grandma. Look. Let's go. No. They called the police. They'll be here any minute. I'm leaving. -Yeah, back to the center with me. -No. -Now. -No. What? Are you fucking stupid? [Grandma] Tarapara. She doesn't like us swearing. Why the fuck did you run away? Explain that to me. And don't say because of the dog. Then I won't tell you. Was it really the dog? You said not to tell you. I can't believe it, you ran away... No, tell me. Please, tell me now. Tell me you ran away because of some shitty dog. He's not a shitty dog. He's my dog and they took him from me. He's not your dog. He's mine and I'm going to get him back. Oh, right. What's your plan? I'll ask the dog shelter who stole him. You think the pound will tell you who adopted him? The dog shelter. -I didn't say I'd ask where he is. -Damn it! You have a month and a half left. Can't you please wait? No. You know what happens if you get caught? -Want to hear what they said? -I won't get caught. Unless you report me like last time. Come on, Mr. My Way. Where? To the pound. Or dog shelter. I'll take you. Let’s execute your shitty plan. We have to take Grandma. -What? -She's dying. Héctor, she's been dying for five years since her stroke. You're dying, aren't you? -Tarapara. -[Héctor] You see? Look, that's enough nonsense. Doctors don't speak nonsense. Everyone thinks she doesn't understand. But she does. [Grandma] Tarapara. Her oxygen level has dropped to 78%. If it drops below 70% she will die. I don't know about medicine, it's what the doctors said, in front of her. I was under the bed. She's taken care of us all our lives. She's never asked us for anything in return. Only to be buried with Grandpa Chiri and to not swear. We promised her. Both of us. Okay. When she dies, we'll do it. You're going to let her die alone? I won't let her die alone. Grandma is sacred. [sighs] We can't just take her with us, Héctor. Yes, we can. You request voluntary release, they give you a wheelchair, an oxygen tank with batteries and a portable oximeter. And you return it later. I stole some sedatives just in case, because I don't know if they'll give us any. A pill under her tongue every 12 hours to relax her. What do you fucking want? To get your dog or bury Grandma back home? Both. For fuck’s sake, we're off to a great start. Two days. In two days you'll be an adult and there you'll stay. -Where? -Wherever you want, Héctor. But without me. So just like it's always been. You didn't steal this, I did. Listen to me. You can't commit a crime until we go back to the center. You got it? -Hmm. -Not "hmm." You got it? Yes or no. Yes. Tarapara. Even Grandma said yes. She didn't say yes, she said we'll see. [monitor beeps] [Grandma rasps] -[brother] What's the dog place called? -Asproan. We have to take the 231, the 623 and the 234. Forget the numbers, we'll take the highway, it's faster. No, there are more police on the highway. We have to take back roads. [brother] What if I hadn't shown up? How would you have done all this alone? I don't know. -Huh? You don't know? -No, I don't. -You know everything but this. -No. Why do you ask me everything twice? So you'll improve your answer. So you can think of a better answer. Why did you bring the camper? To drive it and see if anyone will buy it. You said you'd give it to me when I turned 18. Yeah, after you swore not to get in trouble ever again. Did you keep your side? There we go. Did Marta dump you? Eh? What are you saying? Is that why you're living in the camper? -She didn't dump me and I don't live here. -I can tell you are. -No, I'm not. -Because she dumped you. Okay, are we going to sit here and argue? Fine with me. We won't go after the dog. We'll just stay here. Don't worry about it. I knew you would come. -What? -I knew you would come. This is my second answer. Is it better than the first? Not at all. Then don't ask twice. [engine starts] That's it. -Leave the motor running. -What for? In case we have to run for it. Run for it? We're not running anywhere. [dogs barking] And I'm going in alone. Stay here. They probably called them. They'll call the police if they see you. What will you do? -Something you've never done. -Kill? Ask politely. It won't work. You said so yourself. No, I said it wouldn't work for you. Because you can't talk reasonably. You get confused and screw up. And you only understand things your way, which is always the wrong way. Okay, but leave the motor running. And listen. If you don't listen, no one will listen to you. Don't you dare hot-wire it, I know you. -Hi there. -Hello. Have you got a moment? -Yeah, sure. -Look. The thing is, my... girlfriend came last week to adopt a dog, and she fell in love with one, I think his name is Sheep, I'm not sure, and I was hoping, um... He was adopted. That's what I thought. Do you think there's any chance that I can contact whoever-- No, we can't give out that information. That sucks. You can't imagine how much she liked the dog. Why didn't she adopt him? Because she wanted to ask me first so we would both be sure... People don't come here to choose. They come to adopt. And when they have to consult someone or fall for one dog in particular, they don't want to adopt. That's a little extreme, isn't it? Yes, it is. Because the situation these dogs are in is extreme. Hmm? I'm sorry, but you can't have doubts here. You know how many people change their minds and return dogs? Right. [telephone rings] Anyway, forget it. Hello? Where did they find it? Okay. First you have to go to a vet to see if he has a microchip. The dog, yeah. Grandma, don't die before I come back. Tarapara. [whining and barking] [Roman] Think it through before leaving it there. If nobody claims it in ten days... Exactly. [phone conversation continues] ADOPTIONS [dogs barking] Where the fuck is Héctor? [Grandma] Tarapara. "Tarapara" my ass! What the fuck are you doing? I said to leave the motor running. [man] Hey, come back with that dog, you bastard! [tires screech] [brother] What the fuck did you do? -I took a dog. -I can see that. What for? -For the exchange. -What exchange? When we find Sheep, we'll say the shelter made a mistake and gave them my dog, but it's okay because we brought another one to exchange. Fantastic. You're a genius. Everyone's happy. That's right, everyone's happy. -[brother] But he's missing a leg. -[Héctor] I know. Do you think that will help? It helped me choose him. Because you're missing a leg too. A leg called "brain." And you're missing-- Say it and I'll dump you right here with the three-legged dog. Don't you dare say it. Heart. [tires screech] Should I get out? I thought you were going to say balls. Balls wouldn't be one leg... it would be two. You think I'd be doing all this if I had no heart? Maybe you're trying to get it back. You didn't steal the dog, you got that? I stole it. The file and the dog. Got it? Got it. What day were you with the dog last? [Héctor] Last Wednesday. Since Wednesday, someone has adopted Gnome, Toy, Lola, Rocky, Lucky... No Sheep. End of story. They change the name when they adopt them. If they don't like the name, they change it. If you hadn't named it Sheep, they might have kept its name and we'd have one less problem. Two of them are females. Two less problems. There. Here. What are you doing? Calling the contact number for each dog. No, don't call them. We'll go and check. And if he's there, we'll figure it out. Figure it out? So we have to go to all three places because you say so? We might get lucky the first time. -Or the second. -[knocking] [man] Okay, all set. That'll be 75.40, please. I'm going to pay. Write down the addresses. Get some food. -The fridge only has beer. -No fucking way. No fucking way. My wallet. Damn it! At the dog shelter. It must have fallen out with my keys. -I told you to leave them. -Shut up. Have you got money? Grandma had five euros. How far were you going to get with...? Look, honestly, we're aborting the mission. We'll go back, return the file, the dog, I'll apologize and get my wallet back. -There aren't any cameras here. -So? -We can just drive away. -No. I'm going to explain the situation to the guy. -Leave the motor running. -No. Do you still not understand? That's not how you do things. [door slams] [inaudible conversation] You lost your wallet right after I filled your tank. Yeah, but actually it's not far from here. It's like 20 minutes away. I'll come right back. Okay. -But leave something with me. -Sure. The dog. No, no. We've had the dog our whole lives. Yeah, yeah. The dog, the kid and the grandmother stay here. A lot of people abandon dogs here. Grandmothers and kids too, but less often. I'm going for my wallet. We can't go back there. They'll catch us. I'm only going to check. You two stay here. Why is the motor running? Where did you get that knife? Let's leave before they realize. Before they realize what? The family from the bar. They're paying. What are you talking about? What's this? Did you steal it? I told you I was hungry. -And will you eat the sleeping bags, too? -No. [man] Come back here, you bastard! You didn't steal it, I did. Got it? And give me a croquette. [brother] Have you thought about what you'll do? -What do you mean? -If everything works out. Imagine we get there, tell them what happened, and they soften up for some reason and say yes, they'll take the three-legged dog and you get yours. What will you do? Because you're going back to the center either way. What about the dog? Who keeps the dog? I don't know, I'll see when it happens. I'm telling you right now, I'm not keeping the dog. -Don't pester me. -Don't pester you? You're the one pestering me. The shit I've taken every time you say, "Don't pester me." [loud rattle] -Leave the motor running. -Not again. No. Grandma, don't die before I come back. [engine starts] [church bells ring] Stop, where are you going? -To knock on the door. -No, don't knock. They could be waiting for us. Yeah, the FBI is waiting for us. -You want me to get caught. -Yes, I do. I'd love that. I'd love for someone to put an end to this shit. I can't trust you. Then what do you want to do? Look over the wall to see if Sheep is there. If he's not, we leave without attracting attention. Right, we've barely attracted attention so far. -Yes, we have. -I was being ironic. Come on, help me climb up. You can climb a 12-foot fence but for this shitty wall you need help? Yes. Come on. [brother] I'm used to you stepping on me anyway. Damn. [whistles] [whistles again] Why are you wearing flip-flops? -They took my sneakers away. -Why? So I wouldn't run away. [brother] What an effective measure that was. [Héctor whistles] [dog barks] Is that your dog? -Héctor, is that your dog or not? -Wait. Héctor, it's not a difficult question. No, it's not. Let's go. That's enough for today. [cow moos] [soft guitar music] -Did you put Grandma to bed? -Yes. -Gave her the sedative? -Yes. -Checked her oximeter? -73%. What the hell are you doing with my belt? Making a collar for the dog. [brother scoffs] -Thanks for asking me first. -You're welcome. I was being ironic. You want a beer? No, sorry. You're about to turn 18, we don't want to ruin your immaculate record. That was ironic too. [beer fizzes] [Héctor] I don't like alcohol. [brother] Why not? -I don't like losing control. -Oh, right. You're totally in fucking control. Just out of curiosity, how long would I get for all the crimes I've committed now? If they catch me here, dining al fresco, how long would I get? Enlighten me. When you stole the file did you use force or intimidation? Only against myself. No, Héctor. Medicine theft, document theft, dog theft, theft from a vehicle, fraud at the gas station, motorcycle theft... -All of that-- -Motorcycle? How do you think I got to Grandma’s? Continued and premeditated theft - punished by Articles 234 and 244 of the Criminal Code in relation to Article 74. And minor infraction of fraud - punished by Article 248 and the second paragraph of 249. Olé. -Any previous crimes? -Yes. You. No record, darling. Without a previous record, we'd be talking about a sentence of 12 to 18 months for the continued infraction and a fine of one to three months for the minor fraud charge. So you wouldn't go to jail. Ah! [brother] Great. Great. I'll sleep much better now. -You're not going to name this one? -No. His owner will. Why are you being such a bitch about the dog? I know. Do you want to know? No. When you were little and you'd have a tantrum, or when you got nervous, which was all the fucking time... what was the only thing that calmed you? Me. Well, not me. Me pretending to be a dog. Your dog. You'd crack up and it would pass. You don't remember? -No. -Of course. Rhino. I was Rhino the dog. Because you used to say "rhino" instead of "right now." "Where are we going 'rhino'?" "I want to watch TV 'rhino'." "'Rhino' I'm not hungry. 'Rhino' we're not friends." "'Rhino' I'm crying, 'rhino' I'm shouting, 'rhino' I'm punching." Okay, okay, drop it already. Then I'd get on all fours... and say, "Hi, I'm Rhino the dog." And I'd bark and growl at you... and stick out my tongue and give you my paw and howl at you. And you'd cover your ears and tell me to leave you alone, but I wouldn't listen to you. I'd moan at you and climb into bed with you. And slowly your expression would change. Your fear would go away, or anger, whatever it was. It cleansed you. Now tell me that you don't remember. -It rings a bell. -Jesus, the nerve... The good old days. When we were brothers. [burps] [plays gentle music] [burps] [sniffs] [burps] -[burps] -[laughter] [brother begins to play a song] [burps] [dog whines] [brother sighs] That dog is a fucking pain. -He likes you now. -[Héctor] It can't be. -[brother] Let him climb up. -[Héctor] No. Dogs sleep on the floor. [brother] You'd rather not sleep at all? He'll get tired of whining. You've not got tired in 17 years. Let him up. [tuts] [door slams] [thudding on roof] -[knocking] -[tuts] Grandma, don't die tonight. Tarapara. [thudding resumes] [thudding stops] [distant mooing] [Héctor] Good morning, Grandma. Lift your tongue, Grandma. Tarapara. You haven't talked to Marta this whole time. Or sent her messages. Did she dump you? What are you saying? -Call her. -No. I'll call her when I fucking want to. She dumped you. What did you do? Why did you let her dump you? You're such a pain. You're worse than a hangover, kid. -I can tell you're not well. -How can you tell? Since when do you care if I'm well or not? I don't care, but I can tell. When you're not well you do that. -Do what? -This. Okay, look, I stopped. I'm fine now. Mind your own damn business. Okay, I will. Good, stay out of it. [clears throat] [bleating] [shepherd] Hey, hey! Look, your dog might be there. Whistle and see. [whistles] It's not like that. -[woman] Hello. -[brother] How you doing? [brother] Don't tell me to leave the motor running, huh? Okay, I won't say it. Now we're going to do what we should have done to begin with. Tell the truth. Got it? -Got it. -Yes or no? Look at me. I got it. You, come with me. [dog pants] [sound of machinery] -[brother] Ssh! -[dog whimpers] Hello. Excuse me. Eh... Did you by any chance adopt a dog recently? -Goes by the name of Rocky? -Yes. -So? -[brother] Well, you see... My brother's in a juvenile center... Right now he's on leave and... He's been doing therapy with dogs. And it turns out your dog might be the dog my brother was working with and the one he got very close to. And look at him, he's in bad shape. Because it's the only living thing that he's ever showed interest in, besides our grandmother. And what do you want? To see if it's the same dog. And if it is, to exchange it for this dog, which only has three legs but... he just stays lying down, he's very loyal and good company. Look, we don't know what we want. Or why we made this trip or what we're doing here. That's the truth. Okay, come with me. [brother] Thank you. Come on, you. [man] I found it inside a car that just came in. Totaled. It was scared and malnourished. I called the dog shelter and they told me the car belonged to its owner, who had died in the car accident. Nobody knew how it got this far. They took the dog away and after a few months, when I was wrecking the car, I remembered the dog. I called the dog shelter and they said it was still there awaiting adoption. So I went over there... and brought it home. It's been in its owner's car ever since and won't come out. There it is. Is it him or not? [Héctor] No. [brother] Okay, come on. Héctor. What are you doing? [Héctor] It has long nails, scaly skin and peeled ears. Definitely leishmaniasis. You need to take it to the vet for tests. It'll need treatment for the rest of its life. I can't afford something like that. That's my wallet! It'll die otherwise. No, Héctor. Put that away. -Here. -[brother] Héctor. No, that's mine. Héctor. -Why did you take my wallet? -I didn't take it. -You didn't? -No, I picked it up. Oh, you picked it up. And why didn't you give it back? In case something came up. -Something like what? -Like this. You're definitely something. One more day and I won't have to put up with this shit anymore. Three fucking dogs and we get nowhere with the first two. These things only happen to me. Actually they only happen to you. At least we can't miss now. [monitor beeping] [shallow breathing] [brother] What is that? Shit. We're going to the village. [mooing] [brother] Father. You might not remember me, I'm Chiri and Cuca's grandson. Hey. -That's right. -How are you? How are you, son? Well... [Father] Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up. Amen. Where will you bury her? Here. With Grandpa Chiri. That's why we came. What's wrong? Where is Grandpa? [Father] The lease contract expired. [brother] What do you mean, expired? [Father] The funeral right lasts 75 years. It expired about a year ago. Didn't you receive any notice? My grandmother's been in a home for five years. What happens if it isn't renewed? It becomes available. Okay. How much does it cost to renew? 5,581 euros for 75 years, that's the maximum. -Father, please, that's a huge amount. -We get the money and pay. -We have to bury her here. -I want to too, smart ass. It's your fault we didn't receive the notice. -My fault? -[Héctor] Yes, your fault. You put her in a home and we moved out. Your fault. You are so fucking clueless. Sorry. You think I could have paid for this? [scoffs] Fucking Mr. My Way! -We sell the camper. -It's already for sale, it's not easy. I'm sure you've had offers, but you have nowhere else to live. Don't bust my balls, this is a new problem. We didn't expect this. Besides, when I sell the camper... it'll be for a good reason. This is a good reason. -Look. -Calm down, boys, don't argue. Even if you wanted to renew it, you can't anymore. Why? -Because it's been leased already. -By whom? Your cousin Ignacio. Then where is my grandfather? There, in the cinerary. [brother] The what? [mooing] [man 1] Nice corpus luteum... When are you taking Vicenta to Lausanne? The day after tomorrow. We'll take a look at her when we finish. This one is ovulating. Prepare the embryo, I'll put her tail to sleep. [Ignacio] If I hadn't leased it, someone else would have. Eh? It's a tiny cemetery. Why didn't you call me first? When was the last time you were here? Hmm? Go by Grandma's house and then come and talk to me. She's dying. She probably only has hours left. And all she wanted was to be buried here with Grandpa. I'm really sorry, cousin, but that won't be possible. I already gave the plot to my father-in-law, Kalín. What a shitty gift, cousin. Hey, watch your mouth. He has terminal cancer. There are niches available. Why don't you get one? Eh? Grandma doesn't need to know. But I do. And so does Héctor. Would you have been able to afford it anyway? How could you take out Grandpa and incinerate his remains and put him in a common ashtray? -Cinerary. -I don't care. You mixed him with other people in a fucking ashtray. Do you know what the pH is in the land around here? -What are you talking about? -Under five. So it's acidic land. Very acidic. So? I didn't take him out, cousin. He was already gone. You know what I found in the ditch? Nothing. And I mean nothing. Okay, wait. His watch was there. I kept it. I tell you Grandma is dying and we've brought her here and you don't even ask to see her or anything. What do you want, cousin? You want me to feel bad? Well, no. No. Grandma left. And you haven't been back in years. I'm the only one in the family who stayed. The cemetery is for the people who live here. Hmm? Now, if you don't mind, I have to get back to work. I don't want this to get more heated. Don't worry, Grandma. We fixed everything. He's lying, Grandma. They stole your grave. Are you stupid or what? -She doesn't like us lying to her. -I know, damn it, but... Never mind. I can't take this anymore, my head can't... Stop plotting bullshit because it's over. The land is acidic, okay? Grandpa wasn't there when they dug him up, only his watch. This fucking land even eats dead people. So let's just drop it. Sometimes in life, you have to know how to lose. To win something, anything, for once, first we have to learn how to lose. I already know how to lose. You have no fucking idea, Héctor. No fucking idea. Losing is one thing, we lost and we lost big. Learning how is another thing, with pride, accepting defeat. All we can do now is be with Grandma and wait. Got it? And don't say "got it," I know you never get it. Just nod. [brother plays nostalgic song] Where are you going? To take Grandma for a stroll. What stroll? She's dying. So she can say goodbye to her town. No, you'll get in trouble. I know you. Hey! Hey, stay here, I don't trust you. Then come with us. Great idea. Bring her here so she can see her destroyed house. Is this your cherry on top? [brother] How did Grandpa's story go? The one you always asked Grandma to tell you. She told me a lot of his stories. Yeah, but there was one about a cow that he lost... -Elvira the cow. -Yeah. He didn't lose her, she ran away. [brother] Okay, how did the story go? [Héctor] The cows used to graze on community land, and each breeder had a time of year. If someone else's cow got mixed with yours, you could "adopt" it and ask for a ransom. They called it "adoption." It was legal. One time Elvira got away, she was the cow that gave the most milk. She was adopted and our great-grandfather had to pay a can of oil, a sack of flour, half a kilo of sugar and a dozen eggs. And as punishment, he made Grandpa Chiri sleep in the barn with Elvira for a week, surrounded by cow piss and crap and he stunk. And he wouldn't let him wash to go to school. And after the punishment was over he kept sleeping in the barn with Elvira. And nobody understood why. And Grandma said it was because the kids at school beat him up, but when he stunk they wouldn't go near him, and they left him alone. [brother] So now we know who you take after. [Héctor] And proud of it. [brother] She used to tell us another story about cows. How did it go? I don't know. I only liked that one. What are you doing? Where are you going? -To the camper. -It's that way. You're plotting something. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are, I can smell it. What is it? Tell me. Tell me. I can hear your head buzzing from here. The buzzing is because I'm learning to lose. [tuts] KALIN'S BAR [background chatter] [laughter] [woman] Ignacio told me you were around. -Sorry about your grandma. -Thanks. And about your dad too. Hmm. Because he's really... Papuco. How long did they give you to live? Three months, seven months ago. Maybe we bury them together and everyone's happy. Sorry. I'll serve him, sweetie. Well? -You up for a friendly game later? -No, thanks. -This one's on the house. -No, no. This I can afford. [shallow breathing] [man 1] Tell the Dutchman story. [Ignacio] No, it's stupid. [man 1] Stupid, he says. A Dutchman writes him the other day on Facebook-- [Ignacio] Be quiet already. -Everybody already knows. -Not me. Sorry, I don't know the story about the Dutchman on Facebook. It's a stupid story, cousin. A Dutchman wrote me the other day on Facebook because he wanted to buy my cow before the contest. And I didn't answer him. But he insisted and I said, "Okay, 60,000 euros," knowing I didn't want to sell her. And he goes and says yes. And I said, "Damn. This guy has a heavy wallet." -[laughter] -[man 1] I would sell her. Things have been bad ever since they got rid of the milk quotas. Breeders are killing cows to lower production. [man 2] No way. The key is the offspring. Vicenta will give good ones, no matter which bull. You extract her embryo. Or two, or three, or twenty. And you sell those embryos for money. How much did you make today inseminating? [Ignacio] I'll tell you tomorrow. BICARBONATE OF SODA [knocking] [brother] What's up? [Héctor] What are you doing? -You did remember. -Remember what? The other story. About adopting cows. You never forget anything. Why didn't you tell me? Eh? Go on, tell me. I don't follow. About how the kids in town, to pay for the local fair, they'd steal cows from the farms and adopt them saying they were in their pasture. Now tell me you don't remember. -No. -Yeah, well, you know what? Our cousin has a cow that's like the Messi of cows. -I don't like soccer. -You will now. Look, she's the champion of a million cow things, and our cousin can sell her for over 60,000 euros. And her embryos. It’s a fucking awesome cow. And next week, it’s going to Lausanne for a European championship of some cow bullshit they hold every three years. Like the Champions League for cows. I don't like soccer. We agreed not to do anything. We stay with Grandma and we learn how to lose. Ah! Since when do you listen to what I say? You've had 18 years to listen to me, and you have to start now? Ay! [tuts] Listen to me. This is an adoption story. Your dog was adopted, you adopted me, and cousin Ignacio adopted our grave and now we-- -We're not stealing a cow. -Exactly. We're not. Because I'm going to do it. And it's not stealing. It's adopting. Forced robbery aggravated by the value of the item stolen - two to five years. With previous crimes, definitely jail. I don’t give a shit. Anything for Grandma, right? You're drunk. Well, a little, so what? It makes me braver. No, it makes you stupid. Whoa. You said a bad word. Very good. We won't get Grandpa's grave back. You'll get caught. We'll see. And we'll see if our cousin cares more about his cow or his father-in-law. Oh! How will you get it out of there? Where will you hide it? Did you think about the consequences before you ran away for your dog? Mm-hm. Then stay out of my head, I'm in control. Why do you want Grandma's sedatives? -In case the cow gets feisty. -No way. You can't drug a cow. 337 is untouchable. What's 337? Mistreating an animal. I don't want you to go, Isma. Don't go. I'll tell you one thing, Héctor. The gesture you made, knowing the story about the kids, because you knew it by heart, but not using that information to get in trouble... that proves that you've learned how to control your tantrums. That means that, officially, today... you've learned how to lose. Congratulations. Don't die before I get back, Grandma. Good job, champ. [cow moos] [Isma] Holy cow! [Isma sighs] They're all the same. Which one is it? Fucking cell phone... [phone beeps] STOP SENDING ME VOICE MESSAGES I WON'T LISTEN TO THEM, IT'S OVER [Isma through voice message] Hi, I saw you're online and I'm in my grandma's home town, she's in pretty bad shape. She might die today or tomorrow, we don't know. I thought of you because you two always hit it off so well. I don't know why I'm sending you this if you haven't listened to the rest. [Héctor] The land isn't acidic. [Isma] You scared me shitless. Mix the dirt with water and sodium bicarbonate. -If it doesn't react, it's not acidic. -What? -I learned it at the center. -And you still complain... Change toxic thought into sociable thought. That's why I didn't tell you the story about the kids. I knew it. But our cousin lied to us. What? When they dug up Grandpa, besides the watch, there had to be teeth and bones. That son of a bitch. -Let's get out of here. -No. Not without the cow. -The cow isn't here. -What? -Of course it is. -No. Cows are put in quarantine before championships. You learn that at the center too? No, I read it on the internet. What are you doing with my cell phone? -Why do you know my password? -Shh. -Shut up. -What? [distant music playing] -What? -It's that way. [Tchaikovsky music plays in distance] [crash] [music gets louder] [cow moos] Messi. Shit, a lock. It's all yours. Do your magic, Mr. My Way. I thought you didn't want me to commit a crime. This isn't a crime. We're freeing the cow. You think it wants to be here? Enjoy the music or your superpowers. Just open it. Why are you living in the camper? -What? -Did Marta leave you? Don't be a buzzkill. Not now. Go on. Tell me or I won't open it. Héctor, don't fuck with me. Open it. She dumped you. It's up in the air. Up in the air? Did she leave you or not? Yeah, kind of, but... We really have to do this here? -Yes. -Now? Yes. -I'll tell you later, damn it. -No. She's pregnant. And it was like no... But yes, she is. We were fucking careless. I swear I didn't, neither did she... But suddenly she says that she wants to keep it. And I'm like, "My love, how can you keep it? How can we keep it?" And she says "yes." And I say "I can't." And she says, "What do you mean?" And I say, "I can't... I don't want to." And that's it. Yeah, I have no heart. Go on. That's it, drink and relax a little. What are you doing? [Isma] Of course, of course. Let it all out. If you used your time wisely, good Lord. I don't want you to be like Dad. Let's go. [music crescendos] [Isma] Hey, stop, stop. I can't believe it, that's our cousin's car. He couldn't already know. Or could he? Animals sometimes have a chip with a GPS. -Now you tell me? -Yes. He can't see us with the cow. We have to hide. -He won't leave until we go in. -What do we do? We've "adopted" the cow to ask for a ransom. That's what we'll do. What are you doing here, cousin? [sighs] What I should have done to begin with - come to say goodbye to Grandma. Damn, Héctor, you're so much older. -So are you. -Right. -[Isma] That's the only reason you came? -No. Also to apologize. I was a jerk this morning. And then, Jesus, about the cow in the bar. I'm very sorry, cousin. There. Right. Okay, look, cousin. We want Grandpa's grave. We want the grave. [Ignacio] The grave. I'm ashamed to say it, but that's impossible. Yes, it is possible. No, it isn't. I lied to you. The land here... isn't acidic. There were remains, of course there were. But things were bad with Rosa. She said I don't take care of the girls, or her family, that I'm always with the cows, that I love Vicenta more than her. I play music for Vicenta at night and I don't even take her dancing. Then her dad got cancer, and I did it without thinking about the consequences. I would love nothing more than to give the grave back to Grandma and Grandpa. But if I do, it'll ruin my life. I talked to the mayor and there aren't any more graves. But I reserved a niche in the second row, the best row. The closest, the most expensive. 3,000 euros. I'll pay for it myself. I know it's not the same. I'd understand if you never want to talk to me again. There's no need... to be so radical, cousin. What's done is done. I mean... Don't torture yourself. Look at me. Sometimes you do things without thinking and you have to be understanding. And learn how to lose. And learn how to lose. Forget it, cousin. Hey, look at me! The niche in the second row is fantastic. Yeah. -We want the watch too. -The watch too. Of course, Héctor. Of course you can have it. Take the fucking watch. Why would I want it? Okay, cousin, that's it. [cow moos] Cousin, cousin. There. You can rest easy. Thank you. -[cow moos] -Cousin. -Listen... Cousin. -[cow moos] [Isma] Cousin. Listen to me. Remember when Grandpa Chiri's cow got "adopted"? Well... the sixth row isn't so bad. More privacy. They bother you less. Grandma, you can die peacefully now. No, not yet. Seriously? Now what, MacGyver? Don't do it, Héctor. Come with me, Grandpa Chiri. Grandma? -Already? -No, she's better. Her oxygen level is up to 81%. After the mess we've made, now you're not dying anymore? -Tarapara. -"Tarapara" my ass. Does it bother you she's not dying? Yeah, of course. What are you saying? It just seems like you two are conspiring to make my life hell. -Come on, let's go. -No. -[Héctor] We should wait. -[Isma] Wait for what? -[Héctor] This is common before dying. -[Isma] What? Yeah, you feel better because you're about to go to a better place. You use up what little you have left. -It's better to wait for her to finish. -We can't wait. We have to finish what we came to do. Grandma isn't going to die. So choose - to the center or for your dog, Mr. My Way. You're nicer when you're drunk. [Grandma] Tarapara. Why are you so serious? I'm always serious. You? No way! What are you saying? You're the life of the party. No, seriously, Héctor. You need to learn the meaning of irony. Because the world is fucking ironic. Want me to explain? -Irony is speaking nonsense. -Okay. If you already know... Okay, explain it to me. Okay, an easy example - imagine I go up to cousin Ignacio and say, "Hey, cousin, that's great. It's great you took Grandpa out of his grave for a stroll in the woods." Why is that ironic and not nonsense? Because it wasn't a stroll in the woods. And he understands that my comment was bitter and has another meaning, it isn't literal. And I'm criticizing him. Do you get it? I don't know. Go on, make one up. Make an ironic comment. First think of something that pisses you off. -You reported me to get rid of me. -For Christ’s sake, not again. But okay, that works. Now say that you're completely ecstatic that I reported you. -I'm not. -I know. That's the point. Say it like it's the best thing that's ever happened to you. Thanks a lot for reporting me to get rid of me. No, like you're joking. Eh... "Hey, Isma, I am so glad you sent me to that summer camp. Thank you!" It's not a summer camp. -That's the irony. -And it's two years, not one summer. -I know, it's a joke. -No, it isn't. It's hell. Okay, forget it. It's impossible. You're right. Irony is speaking nonsense. Look. It must be one of those houses. -Pull over. -What? Don't start, eh? -Pull over. -I'm not pulling over, damn it. We're going to the front door. He won't be there. -Why not? -No. Sheep won't be there. Sure, he will. It's the only place left to check. He was at the first house we saw. [tires screech] At the first house we saw? Héctor, quit fucking with me! He was at the first house? Why didn't you say anything? Huh? Will you fucking talk to me for once and tell me what you're thinking? If you made up Grandma dying I swear I'll kill you. No. I don't mess with Grandma's health. Oh, but with mine you do? You can fuck with mine? I'm sorry. Where...? Okay, Héctor. I'll go to jail for you not telling me sooner... but it's okay. But just so I understand... if we went through all this crap... to find your dog, why didn't you say anything? Was he with an old man in a wheelchair or a terminally sick person? No. He was with a dog. With a dog? Yeah, with a dog. With other dogs. [Héctor whistles] [dog barks] -[Isma] Is that your dog? -Wait. Héctor, is that your dog or not? Héctor, it's not a difficult question. [Héctor] He didn't like dogs. He was afraid of them. He never went near them. And he liked playing even less. He preferred to be alone all the time. [Héctor] No, it isn't. I didn't want the trip to end. That's why I didn't say anything. Good night, Grandma. Tarapara. Don't get your hopes up. [cell phone beeps] WE'LL TALK WHEN YOU GET BACK What the fuck? STOP SENDING ME VOICE MESSAGES. I WON'T LISTEN TO THEM. IT'S OVER. I SWEAR THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'LL MESSAGE. I JUST WANTED TO SAY I GOT SCARED ABOUT THE BABY. BUT NOT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT IT. IT'S HÉCTOR. I'VE BEEN A FATHER TO HIM FOR 17 YEARS. AND I'VE DONE A LOUSY JOB. LOOK WHERE HE IS. I SWEAR I'VE TRIED BUT I DID EVERYTHING WRONG. REALLY BAD. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT THE BABY. BUT I THINK I KNOW BETTER NOW. I'M FINALLY LEARNING. I'VE BEEN DOING PRETTY WELL THESE LAST FEW DAYS. DOING THINGS I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. FOR HIM. FOR ME. FOR US. AND HÉCTOR'S GOING TO BE 18 AND HE CAN FEND FOR HIMSELF. I'LL HAVE MORE TIME FOR YOU AND OUR KID. DON'T WORRY, I WON'T BE LIKE MY DAD. I'M SELLING THE CAMPER. SO WE'LL HAVE MONEY. AND I'M WRITING A SONG FOR THE BABY. I CAN DO IT NOW. I WANT TO. CAN I COME HOME? How did you figure out my password? Using the year you were born is fucking stupid. That's true. Scoot over. Since when are you a marriage counselor? So you made the decision for me, huh? Doctor Love? There's no decision to make. -There isn't? -No. And I do care. About what? When you're not okay. I care. Happy birthday. I thought you were giving me the camper. -[Isma chuckles] -That I earned it. Yeah, right. Don't freak out. Your sneakers are too big for me. Put some cotton inside. You don't have any cotton. Some toilet paper. No toilet paper either? -There's a hole. -Damn, bro. Stop complaining. You’re wearing flip-flops. -Hmm. That's true. -Sure. [Héctor] Thanks. [Isma laughs] [Isma] Hallelujah, kid. [seagulls caw] [distant scream] [distant whooping] [whooping] [barking] ADOPTION FILES [monitor beeping] Her oxygen level dropped again. What does that mean? Three minutes ago it was fine. And now it's dropped because... -The three-legged dog cured her. -The three-legged dog cured her. -Hmm. Are you being serious? -No. You cured her with your insults. You just made an ironic comment. And you something stupid. Don't die before I get out, okay, Grandma? Tarapara. And you, look after her. Taraparo. "Taraparo?" Taraparo. [distant shouting] [distant whistle blows] It's just another month and a half. No running away or getting in trouble. When you're 18, Héctor... it has to stop. You said you didn't want this to end. For it not to end... you have to go back in. Otherwise it's impossible. What is? Us being brothers again. In a month and a half, imagine all the dog books you'll be able to read and memorize. You'll come out a veterinarian. The problem isn't the month and a half inside. Then what? After... After what? You won't be there. When I get out, you won't be there. Yeah. You're right, yeah. I won't be there. But anyway, your dog will be. Taraparo isn't my dog. I don't mean Taraparo. And Sheep is fine where he is. I don't mean Sheep either. [Isma whimpers] [Isma whimpers] [impersonates Rhino] Hello, Héctor. [gate rattles and creaks] [Héctor] Okay. Goodbye, Isma. See you later. [howls] [whistles] [whistles]
