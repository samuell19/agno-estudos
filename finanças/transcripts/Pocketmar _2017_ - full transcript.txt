Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby, Park Circus, 4th Route, Topshia Stoppage... Ruby, Park Circus, 4th Route, Topshia Stoppage... Ruby! Sir, please move aside. Get your tickets done... Don't worry, I won't be late. I'll be there in say... half an hour? Meanwhile, start working on the presentation. Finalize the texts! I'm just around the Ruby Hospital crossroad Excuse me... this note is torn. Please change it. Yes, tell me. What do you mean by "He will scold me"? Is this a school? What the... Yes. Just tell him that I'm... Tell him I died. But I can't even die now. First, you go attend office. And then die, right? Wonderful! Utter nonsense! Anyway. Okay, I'll just... I'll talk to you later. Wonderful... Please shift inside everyone! People, come up for Ruby! No, No Sir... absolutely. I'll see to it today. I am extremely sorry. I will...- - May I come in, Sir? I shall have it sent to you by tomorrow. You don't worry... I'll get this done. Erm... I'll ask Srishti to get back to you ASAP. No, no, Sir! I agree... this is absolutely irresponsible of her. I am really sorry for the delay. Yes, have a nice day. Sir... Srishti, look at the time...- - I know, Sir! That's what I came to tell you. But I could not help it today, Sir. My bag almost got stolen by a pickpocket on the bus. He tried to escape with my bag. At the Ruby crossroad...- - What! Yes... Please take a seat. Have some water. Drink it. You people are so careless! Thank you, Sir. Sir, things got so chaotic on the bus... The passengers started beating up the pickpocket. In the middle of it I missed the stoppage. Then I got down and took an auto rickshaw back to the office. Hence... Okay... listen... relax. Yes, Sir.- - And, have some more water. No, it's okay, Sir. Thank you. Honestly, Sir... I know that I've been coming in late at work for some days. But today's reason is very genuine. Your bags, its belongings... money, etc... all okay Yes... I think so. You should be a bit more careful on the roads. Yes, Sir.- - Right? I know.- - Anyway. Just forget about it. Okay? Get to work ASAP... Right? And Mr. Tahil's been calling me..... Erm... yes!- - He's calling constantly. Please send him the estimate right away! Right away, Sir.- - Okay. Thank you.- - Thank you, Sir. Thanks. Srishti... Yes, Sir?- - Your bags... Oh! Yes, Sir... sorry... Where is your mind?- - Thank you, Sir. Phew! Hey... What did you tell him? What do you mean? As in what story did you make up? Boss was extremely pissed with you. He said, "Srishti is late for 3 days in a row"... and what not! My God! What excuse did you give him today? I told him the truth. I was coming by bus. A pickpocket almost stole my bag. Hence, I got late. What! Yes! I've seen that man before. In the same bus. I think he regularly travels on the same route. Replusive looking fellow. And his eyes... I tell you! Criminal eyes. You know... the dangerous type. The eyes say it all. Exactly like that. How can you tell from someone's eyes if they are criminal in nature? Ever noticed Laden's eyes carefully? As in?- - As in these are just... petty druggies looking for money. Don't worry about it so much. Anyway... So I was standing in the bus. And as usual, I can never find me a seat. I was worried, I was late! And the constant phone calls! I kept looking out from the window to check the traffic signal... My bag? Where did my bag go? Hey... Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!- - Hey! My bag! Should have given him a shelling... Who?- - That fellow! That man?- - Yes! Before I could react, the passengers in the bus beat him up black and blue! You won't believe!- - Really? In fact, I tried to stop the public, he would've died! But no one would listen to me! A feeble looking man. His eye had swollen up. His lips were bleeding! It's sad though.- - Yes, it is. But can't help it! Though... I too hit him a little. Did you?- - Yes, fair enough, isn't it? Yes, fair enough. But... Uhh... explain this one little thing. A man took your bag off your shoulder, and you had no clue at all?- - No, I did not! Exactly! What? No, you see, that's not how it happens. Usually what these people do is, they use a blade to slit the bag from below. Stop playing that song, will you? Anyway, so, they slit it with a blade... And whatever they find... They just take it out and escape. Were you a pickpocket earlier? Of course!- - You're not getting it. As in, what you are saying... that too has happened with me earlier. I've faced it. I have! Told you? Told you so, right?- - What? Everything has happened to you, right? As in, anything possible to humanity... Everything under the sun has happened to you! I don't know how she manages this! Why make stories like this?- - Why are you laughing? Why do you find this funny? Listen, I'm not making it up, okay? And this pickpocket... He's a true artist. The way he did it... You can't imagine! Pure experienced handiwork. Slowly, he unlocked the buckle. And one... two... three... And there it goes... Shit!- - See? How am I to know when he escaped with my bag? And my tiffin bag was heavy enough. Where exactly did this happen? At Ruby crossroad. Ruby... You see... I've... read this somewhere... People who lie a lot... As in, people who often make up stories... They come up with intricate details too! As in, they tend to exaggerate things. You know... I am not saying this. Psychology says so. I'll send you the link. Read it.- - I've read it. Okay, one question... If this happened at Ruby, why would the conductor call out "Ruby! Ruby"? What's the point of calling out 'Ruby Ruby!', standing at Ruby? Absolutely!- - Hello, Sherlock! Get to work now. Did you send the mails? Listen, guys, if you think I am making it up... Then why don't you just stop listening? Just don't! And I have the details because of I saw it happen in front of my eyes! Probably, you've never seen someone getting beaten up by the public... So you can't understand... the graveness of the situation! Stop pulling my leg! Why don't you just go and inquire at Ruby? That alone will suffice. You're always making up stories... The day the tiger really arrives, no one will come for help. Hello? Yes, Sir? Srishti? Okay, Sir. Boss is asking for you. Not again now... The tiger is here! I'm very sorry! According to our information... Sir, did you call for me?- - Yes... Come in. Just have a look at this. The passengers started beating him up in the bus itself, leading to pickpocket's death.- - Is this the same guy? The police has arrived at the spot. Right now no buses are being allowed to enter the Ruby area... causing much inconvenience to the daily passengers of this route. The dead body of the pickpocket has been taken for a post-mortem. Didn't you say it happened at Ruby? The deadbody has not been identified yet. We have information that the incident happened on a 24A/1 bus... I'm leaving. Shit... Wow. So, you think this is a joke or something. Who did this? Who opened the buckle? A man died! And people are making a joke out of it! Brilliantly sensitive people! Right? Great! Very good! Srishti... What do you have to say now? Listen... listen to me. You opened the buckle yourself. Remember, you were showing us... how the pickpocket opened it... You had opened the buckle, remember? Yes.- - Srishti, it's fine. Okay?- - Yes. You go home. Take some rest. Calm yourself, okay? Yes, I need rest.- - It will be fine. Sorry.- - Go. It's okay. Go! What are you doing, dude? I didn't do shit. man. What the hell? I didn't do anything.- - You can see she is upset! Please go? Yes.- - Go! I'm going! Go... Srishti... Srishti! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Topshia! Ruby! Ruby! Park Circus! 4th Route! Ruby! Ruby! Here. So the man died because of me, right? Srishti, you're still thinking about this? You see, we all have a fates pre-written, okay? Besides, no one can do anything about this. Look, he committed a theft, so he got beaten up. You know... Tit for tat... Karma... These things? I'm not lecturing you, I'm just saying... Besides, this is also possible that... maybe this isn't the same guy. Maybe someone else died and I'm just...- -Srishti! Srishti! Srishti... You've spoken about this incident all through the day. Now you're obsessing over it. You see, the things we say, the words we utter, they carry an energy of their own. And I've told you this earlier. Right?- - Yes... Just stop talking about this. You will get over it. Anyway, I must leave now. I'm getting late. Oh yes, you're a very punctual person. Right. Okay, I'm sorry! Come here... Let it be!- - Come here! Come here! Come... I don't know why but I just can't stop thinking about this guy. I don't want to take that bus anymore. I'll take some other bus. The incident happened in a 24A/1 bus. The pickpocket was escaping with a woman's bag. When he was about to get down, the passengers spotted him... and he got caught. Watch out please! Wait! Did they block all the roads? They beat him up black and blue! I was there! The way they beat him up... The man died on spot itself. Poor chap. He died on spot? Madam... Madam, they will hit me again! Who are you?- - Please don't go... Madam... They will beat me up again!- - Who are you? Madam, listen...- - Hey you! Madam, just tell me once... Just tell me, did I really steal your bag? Stop the bus! Stop it! Madam, is he disturbing you? This is the same pickpocket, right? What have I done? Please leave him! Madam, just tell them if I really stole your bag... I am getting for work, I am getting calls... Please don't hit me, Sir! No, please let him go! Did I really steal your bag? Madam, please tell them if I really stole your bag! Madam! Madam! Madam! Just tell me... All I want to know is... Did I really steal your bag? Madam... Madam... Madam, please wait... Madam... Madam! Madam, I can't walk anymore. Please tell me if I really did it? No! I don't know... Where are you, Madam? I don't see you anywhere! Madam... Madam... She doesn't understand I can't walk anymore... Madam... My left eye hurts. My lips are bleeding... Hello! Hello? Yes, hello... Rito? I don't know... I don't know where I am! And this guy... He is constantly following me! The pickpocket I told you about in the morning! He was standing in the bus and everyone was beating him! This is not a dream! He is standing right in front of me! Right before my eyes! And he's just... continuously asking me, "Madam, please tell me if I really stole the bag!" How does it matter now, tell me? Madam... Here! Can you hear him? I think I am losing it... I think I am losing it! I don't understand this tit for tat bit... I don't! -What will you tell at home? -Why I will make up a story. I'll say we were on the Bypass road. A girl got hit by a truck. Then we had to take her to the hospital... -That's a lie? -Big deal...
