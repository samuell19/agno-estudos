- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes The Circle will rise. To do for each other, to avenge any brother, the fight to the knife and the knife to the hilts. A brother now languishes in prison through the instrumentality... ...of one Colonel Theodore Wolters. The guiding spirit of the Sphinx Club, that band of amateur criminologists... ...who have made the mistake of tampering with the Circle. I submit to you the name of Theodore Wolters. What is your verdict? Death! So be it. The drawing will proceed. It is fitting that the honor should go to the only woman member of the Circle. I congratulate you. Tonight, by a means already devised, you will execute the sentence of death on Theodore Wolters. And may the luck of the Circle be with you. To do for each other, to avenge any brother, the fight to the knife and the knife to the hilts. I say, what a charming creature! And what gorgeous eyes she has. But better to keep track of Brand with, my dear. I say, Brand, it strikes me you're being a bit selfish with her. How about it, fellow members of the Sphinx Club? All in favor of forcing Brand to introduce us to his fianc?e, say aye! Aye! Say, are you fellows trying to rip me? You forget it's only two weeks since I met Miss Parker. Well, marry in haste and repent at leisure, no? Two weeks ago he was perfectly normal. He couldn't be torn away from us. Then suddenly he meets this charmer and blooey, he announces he's going to resign from the Sphinx Club... ...and do the middle-aisle stuff. Really, old chap, I don't know how we shall carry on without you. Well, maybe this does put our little Sphinx Club on the map. It certainly does. Everybody's talking about it. You know, the Secret Service has been on this case for months. Well, look who they are, look who we are. Hey, by the way, did you know Col. Wolters was going to propose Brand's successor tonight? Well, that's interesting. Did he tell you anything about him? No, nothing except that he's a Hindu. A Hindu? My word, I hope it's not Gandhi. Well, I see the club has its heads together. - Hello, Colonel. - Have any problem? We were just talking about my successor in the club. Well, he may succeed you, Brand, but he will never supplant you. Thanks, Colonel. But I'm sure you'll find this gentleman from India well qualified for membership. - I asked him to meet us here. - Good. Um, Ranking, we're expecting a mister... Yoganda. A Mr. Yoganda. Show him in here as soon as he arrives. - Yes, sir. - Say, by the way, Colonel, when do you expect to occupy your new home? Tonight for the first time. But Melody Manor's not new. In fact, it's one of the oldest houses on Long Island. You know, I love those old mansions. They always have such interesting legends. Ain't scared, are you? Oh, no! Don't be afraid, everybody around here knows me. I'm Old Dan. Well, I'm Nora Rafferty, please go away, won't you? Why, I just come around here to cheer you up. Better save all of that shivering for when the real thing happens. - The real thing? - Sure. Sit right down. We might as well be neighborly. Ever hear about Richard Grayson's ghost? Oh, no! Well, it's been fooling around this house for years. Ever hear how this place got the name of Melody Manor? - No. - Then I'll tell you. Some fifty years ago... ...this house was owned by Dr. Travers Grayson. He was murdered. Oh! Sitting right where you are. He had a wife and a son. Richard Grayson. This boy was in love with a little girl down the road. And every night... he'd go up the attic window... ...and play a certain melody on his violin. It was his way of saying good night to her. And now comes Grayson's ghost. - And now goes Nora Rafferty. - Hush, hush! One night when young Grayson was playing his violin, the girl didn't appear. She had run away with a fellow from the city. Some say Grayson went crazy. Some say that he wandered away. Anyhow, he was never seen again. Mr. Yoganda. How are you, Yoganda? This is Brand Osborne. - I'm pleased indeed. - I'm glad to know you, sir. May I present Mr. Carter. How do you do? - Mr. Graham. - How are you? - And Mr. Wattle. - It's a pleasure, I'm sure. All members of the Sphinx Club. I'm honored indeed. Your recent achievements will be a brilliant addition to the annals of criminology. Handles a bull like a toreador. - Yes, Rankin? - For you, Col. Wolters. For me? Thank you, Rankin. Pardon me. - Rankin. - Sir? - Who gave you this? - A gentleman, sir. I asked him if there would be an answer and he said that you would know the answer. Hm. Take a look at that, Brand. What do you suppose this means? It means that I've been marked for death by the Crooked Circle. Pardon me, may I see that message? Evil is on the way. I get the impression of a knot. Is it a rope? A rope? Can it be a noose? No, it's not a noose. I have it. It's... it's a string. Yes, it is a string. Gentlemen, evil is on the way. And it's tied with a string. A string? Can't you be a little more definite? No, I'm sorry, but not at the moment. Mr. Yoganda has an uncanny faculty for seeing into the future. Tonight of all nights, Col. Wolters, you will require protection. I appreciate your interest, but I'm sure it's all just a bluff. Well, nevertheless, we're going with you to Melody Manor with you tonight. - Mr. Osborne, please. - Pardon. - Yes, Rankin? - Miss Parker is here, sir. Miss Parker? Here? Yes, sir. I've shown her into the library. She says it's urgent. Excuse me, gentlemen. - Brand. - Thelma, dear. What is it? Has anything happened? Not so loud. Brand... Where are you going tonight? Why, to Col. Wolters' place, Melody Manor. - You mustn't. - Why not? For your sake and mine, promise me that you won't go there tonight? Thelma, I don't understand, what do you mean? I mean that if you love me, you... you'll do as I say. Well, of course I love you. But surely you must have some reason. I have. You promised to resign from the Sphinx Club, didn't you? Well, I want you to do it now. That's impossible. I've got to stand by Col. Wolters tonight. His life's been threatened. Yes, I know... I trust you will pardon this intrusion. I was seeking the telephone. Oh, that's quite all right. Miss Parker, may I present Mr. Yoganda. I'm honored indeed. How do you do? Mr. Yoganda's going to be my successor in the Sphinx Club. Mr. Truesdale on the phone, sir. Oh, pardon me, my attorney. What is it, Truesdale? Pardon the deception, but this is not Truesdale. Then who the devil is it? One who would suggest that a woman's advice is sometimes good. Say, what the deuce? Now, you assure me that you carried out your instructions? - Yes. - Are you positive? Yes. Now, Wolters is in there. Yes, I know. What is to be done must be done tonight. The slightest mistake would prove most dangerous, remember that. Oh, yes, India is poetic, beautiful, exquisite. I was just telling Miss Parker about some of the charms of my own country. Oh, Brand, it must be wonderful. I'm afraid most Americans picture India as overrun... ...by squatting gentlemen rendering flute concerts for snakes. - Well, again I must apologize. - Not at all. - Oh, you wanted the telephone. - Yes. Well, you'll find it in the hallway just to the left. Thank you. - I must run along now. - All right, darling. - Don't forget, 10 o'clock. - I won't. I wonder what's keeping the great lover. - We got to get started. - I'm sorry I had to leave. What are the plans, Colonel? Well, Kinny and Arthur are going to my apartment. They think the Circle may strike there. The rest of us will go to Melody Manor now. I'm afraid I can't get out there before eleven. That's all right, my execution is set for midnight. We'd wait for you, Brand, if it weren't for Nora's nerves. My housekeeper. Being alone in an old mansion after nightfall isn't one of her recreations. Good night, Brand. Many a times when I pass this old house... ...I've seen a light in that attic window here. And heard that strange melody... ...played on his violin. And every time that melody is heard, something always happens to somebody. Something always happens to somebody? Oh! Oh! That's him. Young Grayson is with you tonight. Poor fellow, still hoping to find her. Something always happens to somebody. Oh... Sounds like he's in here. Let's go in. We can hear it better. Put up your hands. Who are you? The gentleman who gave you some good advice. Then perhaps you'll be good enough to explain this unannounced visit. Certainly. Col. Wolters paid us a visit the other day... ...and we are returning that call. Oh, the Crooked Circle, eh? Exactly. Listen, Brand Osborne. You think you're going to see Thelma Parker tonight. Well, you're not! Sounds like we're going to have company. Hey, was you blowing a whistle? - No, I was tuning it. - Well, what's going on? I seen a guy crawl up there and go through that window. Come on, we'll get him. - Take that off. - What's the idea? Take it off, hurry up! But look, if I'm busted for neglect of duty, it's all your fault. Well? Well, come on. Put that hat on, give me that pipe. Now put those hands up. Put them up! Well, what kind of a party is this? It's all right, officers, he didn't get very far burglarizing my apartment. - Your apartment? - I seen him crawling through that window. So I runs up and crawls in after him. - Yeah, and I come too. - Yeah, Mike come too. I tell you this is my apartment. This man forced me at the point of a gun to change clothes with him. Take him away, boys, I think he's crazy. If you alow this criminal to escape, I'll have you both dismissed. Nonsense, officers, take him away. Psst! Come here. Suppose this guy's on the level. We'll be in an awful jam. Yeah, well what about it? What do you think we ought to do? Let's take them both in. Just what I was gonna say. Come on. After carefully thinking the matter over, I've decided there's some doubt as to the identities... ...and so I'm gonna run yous both in. - Why, nonsense. - Just a moment. If there's any doubt in your minds, I can settle it quickly. Rankin, I want... Rankin! Did you ring, sir? Will you tell these officers who is master here? Why, you are, sir. Why, Rankin, what are you... Hey, you know who this bird is? - Never saw him before in my life. - Why you rattlebrained... Just what I thought. Come on you, come with me. - Wait a minute... - You're coming with me too. Yeah, come with Mike too. Anything you say can be used against you now. Hey, Sergeant, here's a high-class mug I picked up on a second-story job. - Yeah, and I picked him too. - Yeah, Mike picked him too. Now listen, Sergeant, I demand to be heard. My name is Brand Osborne. And my name is Sergeant Murphy. And I can't tell you how glad I am to meet you. Never mind the comedy. Take me to Captain Drake, I'm a personal friend of his. Another friend of the captain, eh? Every guy that gets pinched is a friend of the captain. Captain Drake, here's another friend of yours, sir. - Well hello, Captain. - Why, Brand Osborne. These officers brought me in. What does this mean? Crimmer brought him in, sir. Mike brought him in too, sir. - Why, I tried... - Yeah, Mike brought him in too. - I've never heard of such stupidity! - Yeah, and that's not the half of it. But I'm late for an appointment now, Captain. If you walk out with me I'll give you the lowdown on the whole story. Certainly, and I'm very sorry this happened, my boy. Why did you have to come here? At midnight you'll look at the clock and listen. Fifty years ago it struck thirteen... and old Mr. Grayson was found dead. Again it struck thirteen and old Mrs. Grayson was found dead. Again it struck thirteen... ...and young Grayson ain't never been seen again. Tonight, if that clock should strike thirteen, Beware! - Be where? - Beware! Oh, if that clock strikes thirteen, I'll be more than beware. I'll be gone. Thirteen! Beware! Oh! The clock! It's all right, Nora, open the door. Oh, Mr. Wolters. - Well, gentlemen, here we are. - Hello, Nora. Well, you certainly got what you wanted. As old as the hills and as isolated as an igloo. No doubt filled with fragrant memories and traditions of a dead past. Come along, I'm anxious to show you the place. Oh, I'm sorry you got a headache, sir. Shall I get you a bromo-seltzer? What do you think of it, Mr. Yoganda? Oh, please keep away from that clock, mister. And please, Col. Wolters, get out of that chair. Nora, what's the matter with you? Well, there's a ghost in the house and he plays the violin. And when he does something always happens to somebody. Where did you get all this rot? Oh, a queer old man dropped in to cheer me up... Miss Parker's apartment? Oh, hello, Margaret. Call Miss Parker, please. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Parker isn't here, sir. But I had an appointment with her at 10 o'clock. Where did she go? Well, I really shouldn't say, sir, but... she did mention something about a... a Melody Manor. What's that? You heard her say Melody Manor? And every time the ghost plays that violin something always happens to somebody. Don't be silly, Nora, ghosts are a myth. I know, sir, but maybe this one doesn't know it's one. Nora, do you know what a myth is? Yes, sir... a female moth. - Run along, Nora, open the door. - Oh! I'm afraid Nora doesn't share your enthusiasm for Melody Manor. What do you make of her story, Yoganda? Evil is on the way. There's a man at the door to see you, sir. Says he's a neighbor but he looks like a myth. Send him in, Nora. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do? I live in the little house at the foot of the hill. - I brought you these. - Oh, thanks, I'm very fond of tomatoes. Are you, sir? - I'm so glad. - My name is Wolters. To whom am I indebted for this gift? They call me... Harmon the Hermit. But no one ever sees me. I'm too slick for them. Yes, sir. And why honor us with a visit? I always visit the folks in this house the first night. No telling how long they'll be here. Hey, what's he mean by that? It ain't often folks live in this house... ...since the Graysons died. And I believe there's good reason. Queer things about this house. But I ain't afraid of queer things. I ain't afraid of nothing. I hear Grayson's music. Yes, often. Sometimes I think he plays to me. He likes me. And I like him. Of course he ain't people. He's a ghost. Yes, sir, he's a ghost. Yeah, drop in again some time. Evil is on the way. I guess that's Brand. Harry, if you don't mind. Certainly. - Oh, here you are. We were just... - Where's Thelma? What? Say, what's eating you? Where's Thelma? I'm sure I don't know. - She's not here? - Wait a minute, Brand. - What's the matter with you? - Plenty. Half an hour after you left my apartment I was stuck up... ...by one of the members of the Crooked Circle. And that isn't all, For some or no reason, Thelma begged me not to come here. And then I found that she had suddenly left for Melody Manor. Now I've got to find her. There's no need to worry, she will be here. Listen, if you know anything about this... Where's that fireman, where's that fireman? - What do you mean, what fireman? - Never mind that stuff. Where's the guy I was following up that road? Come on now, which one of you guys done a dash for it? I did. Oh, it was you. Oh, well... Oh, well, uh... that's different again, uh... I never knew it was you. I didn't know it was him. ( defective audio ) Thelma! What is this? - Say, what is this, a nuthouse? - Come on, Nora, what is it? - There's a violin, I heard it again. - But did you see anything? - No, sir. - Did anything move? - Yes, sir, I did. - Harry, go look. Perhaps Crimmer will be good enough to stay here with Nora. I'd rather stay here. Harry, you and I will try the attic. - Mr. Yoganda, do you happen to be armed? - Always. Then I'll depend on you to watch this hallway. Egyptian. Probably valuable. Yes, I understand old Dr. Grayson had quite a collection at one time. Hey, look, is everybody crazy around here or just a couple of yous? Don't talk, don't talk, I heard the violin. You heard a violin? Well, what would you do if you heard a full orchestra? Don't go away. Sturdy-looking chap, isn't he? I wonder who he was. Oh, Harry, perhaps you'd better go downstairs and join Brand. Also assure Nora that her phantom fiddler's gone on tour. Rather a disappointment too. I should like to make his acquaintance. Just a can of glue. I'll be down presently. I'm going to rummage around awhile. Well, have you bumped into any fiddling ghost? I'm not looking for any fiddling ghost, I'm looking for Thelma. Now take it easy, old man, be calm. How can you expect me to be calm under circumstances like these? By the way, didn't you say that Miss Parker was an accomplished violinist? - Why, yes, she is. - Aha, that's interesting. - What do you mean? - Oh, nothing, nothing at all. A very charming accomplishment playing the violin. Oh, it's you again. I thought it best that I come. It is not well that you be alone too much. Did you hear that violin? It was right here in this room. It was indeed in this room. Yoganda, I think perhaps we'd better join the others. - Mr. Crimmer... - Crimmer to you. Oh, please don't leave me here, not until after 12 o'clock anyway. Oh, did you hear anything, sir? Not a sound, and I'm very fond of music too. Well, if you ask me, I think this ghost stuff is a lot of hooey. Not at all. Our ghostly friend has just entertained me in the attic. Oh, and something always happens to somebody. - You heard that melody? - What was it? Did you see anything? Count them strokes! Six, seven, eight, nine... ...eleven, twelve, thirteen. - Brand! Brand! - I heard a voice. - Thelma! Thelma! - Easy, Brand. What's going on here? Oh, what did I tell you? Something always happens to... And that guy with a rag in his head. Oh! Oh, what kind of a house is this? It's the kind of a house I ain't gonna stay in. - Come on, let's go in here. - I'll go with you. Oh, I'm scared stiff! Don't call me a stiff. You go through there and see what you can find, I'll meet you here in a few minutes. Okay. Quiet. You're going to do exactly as I tell you. Hands up! Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Osborne, I did not recognize you. Yoganda! What are you doing here? Merely pursuing evil. Talk sense. Have you seen anything of Miss Parker? I'm sorry to report that I have not. We've got to concentrate on finding Miss Parker. Let's go up and have a talk with Col. Wolters. That would be impossible. Impossible? What do you mean? Col. Wolters has disappeared. - Disappeared? When? - When the lights went out. Come on, Yoganda. - Oh! - There ain't nobody in any of them rooms. There ain't nobody anyplace, as far as I can see. That's not very far. Yeah, well if you ask me, we're all going around in a circle. A circle's right. The Crooked Circle. They promised Col. Wolters they'd get him. I guess they did. Well, why didn't you tell me they threatened him? You know, them Circle guys is tough babies. They wasn't born, they was quarried. We know all about that, Crimmer. What we don't know is what happened to Col. Wolters. Just what I... Hey. What's that? Col. Wolters' revolver. - That proves he was in this room. - Yeah? I wonder if there are any fake doors or secret passages here. Just what I was gonna say. Oh, there ain't no panels in this... Hey, look! It's Col. Wolters. He's dead. Strangled with a violin string. Yoganda said evil was on its way with a string. What's happened? Poor old chap, they got him after all. It was written that evil was on the way. Didn't I say it would be tied with a string? Crimmer, get the coroner. - No, no, don't do that! - Why not? Well, it would be better to continue the search for Miss Parker without interference. Now wait a minute. I'm an officer of the law, don't overlook that fact. Say, by the way, Brand, before you got here tonight a queer-acting hunchback brought in a basket of tomatoes. That's strange. Yoganda, have Nora bring in those tomatoes. Certainly, Mr. Osborne. Oh, we're gonna eat? Now listen, Crimmer. Before this happened, Col. Wolters was in the attic. Now you go up there and see what you can find. Ah, what could you find in an attic? Oh, so you're afraid, huh? I thought so. Oh, you're taking me on, huh? Alright, I'll show you. I'll look up in that attic. I'll look up in two attics. I'm not yellow. Yellow, huh? Well I'll show you... What's the idea of interfering with an officer in discharge of his duty? I was in a hurry. It's alright to be in a hurry but take your time about it. Will you let go of that thing? Don't... leave me alone. Oh, mister... Mr. Osborne, did you send for these to... Oh... oh... oh... Oh, what happened? Now, Nora, you must be calm. - Col. Wolters is dead. - Dead? - Oh! - Come on, Nora, sit down. Ohh! Ah! I tell you Col. Wolters wasn't strangled. Oh... - You can go, Nora. - Where? Go up to the attic and stay with Crimmer. But I don't like attics. Run along, Nora, this is no place for you. Oh, I'll say it isn't. If he'd been strangled, his lips and nostrils would show it. Then what do you suppose killed him? I don't know, but... Maybe he was poisoned. We'd better keep these for the coroner. Oh, Mr. Crimmer. Aw. Oh... Oh, Mr. Crimmer! Ain't you afraid of that awful thing? Who me? I should say not. I make no bones about a thing like that. Is that good or is that good? Oh! Hey, I guess... I guess maybe we'd better be getting out of here. Say, what's the matter with you, Sergeant? Put that thing away! Now what is it? What do you mean... Don't do that! Come over here and talk to me, will you? Come here. Now come on, old man, now take it easy, what is it? What is it? Now wait a minute, what is it? I... I... I... I... All right, now, now, let's start it all over again. - I... I... I... - I got it! You heard that melody. It wasn't that, I... I was... I was chased by the ghost himself. Here, sit down, old man, sit down. What's... what's more... he kicked me. You've got the niftiest case of the heebee-jeebies I've seen in a long time. Nerves are tricky things. But a slug of this makes a person yearn for gho... Brand! Brand! - Brand! Bra... - What's the matter? Come here, quickly. The strangest thing has just happened. - Crimmer disappeared. - What do you mean? He was sitting in that chair. I turned to pour him a drink like this... then I turned to give it to him and... he was gone. - And then what happened? - I took the drink myself. Oh, this is terrible. Shouldn't we look for Mr. Crimmer? We might as well, we're looking for everybody else. Oh, Harry... Harry, you run along. I've got to think it over. Now, keep hold of yourself, old man, keep hold of yourself. Come on, Nora, we'll try the rear of the house. Died of fright! Murdered! - Oh, you frightened me! - Well, you didn't do me much good either. What's the matter? Some mug making you walk home? No. I... I was taking a shortcut. My car broke down. Yeah? Well it sound phony to me. I'd oughta put you under arrest, only I got a murder on my hands. A murder? Who was killed? A guy named Col. Wolters. Oh... I see. Yeah? Well, I wish I did. Now come on, sister, you better beat it. All right, Captain, good night. Good night. Put up your hands! Well, well, this is a pleasure. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Well, what do you intend to do? First I'm going to call for reinforcements. Then you're going to lead me to Thelma Parker. Or else. - Did you ring, sir? - Rankin! - Yes, sir. - Rankin, what are you doing here? You rang, sir. - You know this man, Rankin. - I never saw him before in my life. Why, that's exactly what you said about me this afternoon... in my apartment when this man... What infernal business is this! The last time I saw Mr. Crimmer he acted kinda funny. Oh, do you think that his mind might be wandering? Don't worry, his mind couldn't wander very far. It's Mr. Crimmer! Where did I hit him? Oh, where did I hit him? On the head fortunately. - Come on, Crimmer. - Oh, did I hurt you, Mr. Crimmer? Now, take it easy, old man, take it easy, you're all right. Bet your life I'm alright. - Who is this woman? - It's me. A very charming person when you come to know her well. ...don't you Crimmer? Brand! Oh, something always happens to somebody. Brand, Brand, come out of it. Come on. Now two of us are dead. You've had a narrow escape. I came face to face with a policeman. - Did he suspect you? - Oh, he suspects everybody. No, I'll take care of him. Did Rankin arrive? Yes, about thirty minutes ago. Well, good. Now what are the plans? The meeting is called for 1:15. One-fifteen? Why, you just have time enough to make it. Now here. Here is the ring. Are you sure you'll go through with it? Yes. I haven't forgotten my oath. You can depend on me. And you can depend on me. So I rang for Nora and who do you suppose answered the bell? Well, in this house I wouldn't be surprised if it was Christopher Columbus. I rang the bell and in walked Rankin. Rankin? Well, can you beat that for service. Well, my head feels like a bass drum. - Yeah, flat and empty, huh? By the way, Crimmer, what did happen to you? Well, I was swinging a rolling pin... ...and Mr. Crimmer's head happened to come under it. That's all right, Nora, we'll get you another rolling pin. Say, did anyone see that Hindu? Yes, I saw him come out of the library when the lights went out. If you ask me, I think he killed Col. Wolters. I wouldn't say those things, Nora, if I were you, unless I had a reason. Come to think of it, Brand, Yoganda did object to calling the coroner. Just what I was gonna say! Crimmer, would you mind sitting in that chair for a moment? Oh! I wouldn't sit in that chair for half a moment! There's nothing wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with the electric chair till they press the button. What's that? Hey, what were you looking for? You heard that shot, didn't you? Hm... I've met this little gun before. Oh, look! They're graves! Well, where'd do you think they put dead people in, balloons? Well, I don't like graves at night. Aw, what do you care as long as you ain't in one of them? Hey, you know, this thing is turning into a mystery. It's worse than that, it's a nightmare. Come on, I think we all had better go back to the house. - This is a dreary place, gentlemen. - Yoganda, I believe you know more about this case than you pretend to know. Mr. Osborne, surely you do not question my integrity. Frankly I do. In fact I question it so strongly... I'm inclined to instruct the police officer to make your arrest. Yeah, and he'd only have to instruct me once. There are no facts to warrant this action, and I resent it. Oh, you do, eh? Well, you'll either lay your cards on the table right now... ...or be taken into custody. Suppose, um... Suppose I could and would lead you to Miss Parker, would that induce you to forget my arrest? Why, of course it would. - Where is she? - Hey, wait a minute, now! The law is the law, and if this guy needs arresting, he's gonna get it. I'll be responsible. Very well, I will promise to reveal everything. - Will you come with me? - Alright, but look here! Remember this, if you're tricking us, it's gonna be tough sweating for you. Now, gentlemen, be as quiet as possible. And they say Steve Brodie took a chance. - I can't go in that grave! - Well, stay here then. - I can't do that either. - Well, then jump up in the air and cross. Gentlemen, this is extremely dangerous. You wish to proceed? Put up your hands, all of you! And don't anyone move! Gentlemen, I want to introduce to you... the Crooked Circle. Counterfeiters and thieves de luxe. First I shall present the leader. Your faithful servant Rankin. I'm sorry you forced me to shoot. And here, Mr. Osborne, is an old friend. It seems inevitable that we should meet every hour or so. Yeah, and there's a mug you won't be meeting again for at least ten years. Make a sap out of me, will you? And here are a pair of Kings. Emmanuel and Louis King. And now to redeem my promise. Miss Thelma Parker. Thelma. I can't believe it. Look out, Brand! I got the woman! I got the woman! Hey! Oh, it's me! Oh, Crimmer, you idiot. I could break your confounded neck. Come on, Harry. That would be you! Come on, Crimmer, they must have gone this way. Who, what, what way? Oh, Mr. Crimmer! Over there and line up. Come on. Hurry up. Thelma! What's the meaning of all this? - Tell me. - Not now, Brand, please. I could give you an earfull. So your automobile breaks down, huh? Well, so does your alibi. And this is Miss Yvonne Ren?e. The only woman member of the Crooked Circle. The lady's ring. Oh, yes, I'd almost forgotten. Many thanks. Your ring was most necessary to our little deception. What a splendid help you turned out to be. I've been tied up for hours. My, I'm glad this is over. Mr. Yoganda, don't you think you... Oh, yes. Mr. Osborne, I think it's time that I introduce myself. - The Secret Service? - Yes, and Miss Parker's my valued assistant. Thelma, you and the Secret Service? Yes, Brand, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before. For the love of Pete, Brand, where have you been? Oh... Oh... Something always happens to somebody. I... oh... Come on now, which one of you guys is trying to start this thing all over again? I'm certain it's here in this room. Get out of here! Get out! What do you want here? I see that raising tomatoes isn't your only hobby, Mr. Harmon. Get him! Get him! Get back there all of now! Get back there! Get those handcuffs, put them on! Harry, you'd better stay here and help Crimmer. - I don't need no help. - Just what I was gonna say. That was Yoganda's voice and it came out of this chair. This is the source of your ghostly music. Here's the old master himself. There's one of them things in every room. This is my house! And they took it away from me. And I swore if I couldn't have it, no one could. And I kept them out. For years I just played my violin. And Rankin came around and installed these things. And made it very easy for Richard Grayson's ghost. Come on, Professor. Come on, enjoy the orchestra. - Come on. - Officer! Not too rough. Harmon's not one of the Circle. He's just an eccentric old musician. Oh, well then will you please step over here? Over there, do you mind? Well, sounds like the police are coming at last. Ye... What? It's all right, officer. I phoned for the patrol wagon. You may take them out. Okay, chief. Alright, you mugs, on your way. Keep going. Start with you, hurry up. Outside, get going. Come on, keep going, keep on. Hello, Riley, haven't seen you in years. - I came too. - Oh, you did, huh? Well, get down out of there and let me shove these birds in the cage. Get in there, get in there. And then the guy that likes ghosts came in with a basket of tomatoes... and started telling us that... Go away! You're dead, you're dead! Tell him he's dead, somebody. He don't know! What's the matter with you? - He... he's real. - Have you all gone crazy? Now, let me explain, Col. Wolters. Since midnight I've held you in a state of suspended animation. We of India frequently practice it. Why practice it on Col. Wolters? Because I knew that the criminals would not attempt to kill a man... ...who apparently was dead. Well, you better come along and report to the Lieutenant. No, the Lieutenant's gonna wait. - I got a murder on my hands. - A murder? - Where, in there? - Yeah. ( defective audio ) But I ain't afraid of no ghosts. I'm afraid of nothing. Okay, Riley. Now, about this murder. Take it away, take it away! Col. Wolters isn't dead, Crimmer. He is too dead, he is too dead, isn't he dead? I've seen them deader. It's all right, officer, the mystery is solved. That may be to you. But it goes down in my book as murder. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to marry the first man I meet. Look, my name is Crimmer. Oh, Mr. Crimmer. Well, something always happens to somebody. - Just what I was gonna say. - Oh, my. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
