Did you miss me? Personally, no. But crusades start next week, and Preacher's asking for you. Why are you calling him Preacher? Don't he's your father? - No. - Oh. Why you say it like that? Nothing. He's my guardian, ever since my father and mother died. That's why he's so strict with you. It's for my own good. Excuse me. - Who this bicycle frame belong to? - Preacher. - You think he'd want it? - Don't have no use. I can fix it up. Maybe you and I could go for a ride. I don't think so, you know? Just a ride. - Perhaps. Depends. - Depends on what? If you're a true Christian. The rest of boys too rude. Some Christians rude too. I don't know about that. El numero uno has arrived! I know you're playing in Preacher's garden. You know, Preacher tend that little cherry tree for a long time now. When fruit ripe, if Preacher don't pick it, I feel I will pick it. Look like it's ripe too. "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. "They toil not, neither do they spin. "And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory... "was unarrayed like one of these. "Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field, "which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, "shall He not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?" Brothers and sisters, before you leave, I'd like to inform you that you won't be able... to pick up your records for the rally today. The master record has not arrived from America. I'll let you know about that during the course of the week. Now let us stand and sing and praise. Be guided poor lost sinner Before the Lord inform And in the name of Jesus A pardon He'll perform He heard Thy supplication And soon the weak were strong For Jesus took my burden And left me with a song Yes, Jesus took my burden I could not help Him bear Yes, Jesus took my burden He answered to my prayer He answers prayers I'm certain My spirit was made strong For Jesus took my burden And left me with a song Who turned off... I did. You're gonna make the Lord come back and find you doing this? - Doing what, Preacher? - Boogie-woogie and twistin' up yourself in my yard. They don't have boogie-woogie anymore, Preacher. I don't care what you want to call it! I don't want it in my yard. All right, Preacher. I'm finished for the night, sir. And furthermore, what are you doing here at this time of night? - I was fixing the bicycle. - Fixing your bicycle? You should be reading your Bible. Reading your Bible! You hear what I tell you? Reading your Bible three times a day! - All right. - Don't walk away from me. You're impertinent! - You're rude! Don't have respect! - Preacher on the warpath tonight. - I wonder why. - Must've noticed what we noticed. What has Preacher got to do with that? Preacher is a man of the Lord, but still... He is a man, all the same. And the Lord say, "Go ye forth and multiply," and Preacher don't multiply yet. Preacher has been my guardian, and he will always be my guardian, and that's that. - When nothing else could help... - Yes! - Then love came down! - Amen! It rescued the perishing! Cared for the dying! Snatched us from iniquity! Raise us from the grave! Tonight, here is love! Praise God! - We say it is a gift of God! - Amen! Amen! Tonight, the wages of sin is coming! It's death! It's damnation! It's derogation! But here is the love of God! - Here! - Love worketh no end! Love thinketh no evil! Love never fails to accept, not even if provoked! Praise God! Let us give thanks to Jesus! - Thank you, Jesus! - Let's alleluia! - Alleluia! Alleluia! - Let's praise Him! - Longa? - Yes, Preacher? - Where is that boy? - I don't know, Preacher. He might be in his automobile. His automobile, huh? And where have you been? I just been for a ride, sir. You've been skylarking, and I can't find you? All I can find is this nastiness in the place. And you get into the house. Do you know how long we've been waiting for this? If we don't get to the studio, we won't have any records for the rally. - I can take it right now. - By the time you get there, it will be closed. I can take it down right now, sir. And be sure you come back in a hurry.

Can turn that amplifier down. - No, Ivan. - Why not? - I just can't do it. - If it wasn't for Preacher, I know you'd do it. That sort of music can't play in church, Ivan.

No! - You've been fornicating with him! - No! - You gave him your lips. You gave him your body. - No, no! - Look at you! - No! No! Hi. I hear you resigned your post, man. What are you doing here? - I come for my bicycle. - Which bicycle? That same one. This bicycle is yours? Since when? Where you buy it from? I didn't have to buy it. I see it throwed in back. Nobody claim it. - This is Preacher's bicycle. Preacher's premises. - Well, I fixed it up. Who told you to fix it? I'm grateful, because Preacher give it to me. It took me three weeks to fix the bicycle, Longa. I paid $6 for the wheels alone. That is your bad luck. Don't joke with your life, Longa. Give me my bicycle. If it is your bicycle, take it, man. Him cut me! You want dead? I will kill you. Don't... fuck... with... me. You've had every chance to make good. You've been taken into the church... and given a chance to lead a good Christian life. And instead of that, you've gone and filled your head... with foolishness and violence. Since this is your first offense, I'm not going to send you to jail. I'm going to give you a chance to come to your senses. Either it will bring you down to earth once and for all, or there's little hope for you. Eight strokes of the tamarind switch.

That don't sound right. - How much do you think it's worth, then? - I don't really know, sir. Come on, you must have an idea. What do you think it's worth? Well, I think at least about $200, you know, sir. I don't think I'm signing this for $20, you know, sir. I see. Looks like you have a new producer. I wish you luck. - Numero Uno! - Hi, brother. How are you doing? Not bad, you know. I have this record I'd like you to play for me. Let me have a look. Hey, you're on a Hilton's label. No, well, I used his studio. I like the sound. I see. But, well, I deal directly Hilton's, man. But this is my personal record, you know. This is personal. I'm an independent producer as well. Well, like I said, I deal with Hilton's direct. You know, this is show business, baby. No business, no show. The oppressors are trying to keep me down Making me feel like a clown - No, man, you're joking. What I gonna do with this? After Hilton cut me off, you gonna supply me? Hilton don't want this thing. Take it back, son. Every day you say you're gonna sell the record, but you can't without Hilton. We've waited long enough, man. I want the money now. I'm gonna get my share now What's mine And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall One and all - Mr. Hilton. - What do you want now? - To make another record? - Not exactly, no, sir. - What do you want, then? - I want the money. Which money? Which money? Talk quick. Which money? You'll take the $20? Yes, I'll settle for that. You're damn right you'll settle for that. I don't even particularly want to do business with you anyway. - What do you say your name is? - Ivanhoe Martin. Ivanhoe what? Martin. Here. Sign here. And remember... next time you cut a record, you see, sport, that I control this business. Understand? Okay? And remember something else. I make hits, not the public. I tell the DJs what to play. Understand? What do all of you want? Ivanhoe no pay any of you yet? But Ivan's supposed to pay you now. I not supposed to give you money. Anyhow, come. And let this be a lesson to you, see? Learn something from this next time. Remember that fellow that wouldn't sign the contract? You can release it. - Him sign now? - Yep, but don't push it. Tell the DJs I just want to make back my money, okay? - But, sir, it's a good record, you know. - I know, I know. But he's a troublemaker. I don't want anything to do with him.

They will just have to hold off for a couple of days, Jose. - But the traders pay protection... - Leave it to me. Traders pay protection money, and one of them got shot. Tell them not to get frightened. Just cool it for a couple of days and leave it to me. - What about Pedro's wife? - You organize that. Find somebody to take her place, all right? Check with me later. I have to go now, but you check me at the police station. All right. Hello. Get me the commissioner of police. Detective Ray Jones calling. Hello, Commissioner. Yes, sir. The army went in today and shot one of my people's women. - They're doing a series of raids. - I know, but nobody told me! - Who did they kill? - An informer in the ganja trade. They can't be concerned with who is an informer. Well, I am concerned. How can I control crime in my area... if the people giving me information can't operate freely? Look, I know you use the trade as a form of control, but I can't explain that officially. All I can do is ask the army to cooperate. Would you please explain that if anybody controls what comes into town, it's me? Rupert, your mother dead. She can't help you. Come. Come, let's go home. Hi, baby. Get any work today? Big night tonight, you know. Look what I buy you. Ivan, you mean you take your money and you buy that? It's a mini. Sexy. Where's the food I asked you to buy? You have any money left? Don't worry about money, man. After my record... You sold out the record to Hilton for $20. You don't have any more to get. Just wait until the other producers hear my record tonight. We'll drive away from this place tomorrow. - Give me $2 for tonight. - Where I must get it from? You have it in your bosom, man. - I only have $2 left. - That will do.

You think I'm just joking? All I'm telling you is that I'm tired. You want me to go and beg work for $ 10 a week for the rest of my life? I tried that. I'd rather die. And I don't have to, because I'm gonna make it. Ivan, you're a dreamer. Me? Dreamer? Who's a bigger dreamer than you? Always talking about milk and honey in the sky.

The oppressors are trying to keep me down Yes, I can usually do it, man, but it's gone too far now. It's on the charts. You know I always cooperate with the police, man, but this time... I know how you feel, but I wanna catch him myself. Do me a favor. You tell me when you catch him, so I can get him to make another record for me before you string him up. Hey, what are you doing in the man's car? - You can drive? - Yes. Drive. You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want But you must try Try and try Try and try You'll succeed at last Mmm-hmm-mmm, oh, yeah Persecution you must bear Win or lose You got to get your share Got your mind set on a dream You can get it though hard it may seem now You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want But you must try Sidney, how much time I lock you up? Three times. Yes, sir. How much time I let you off? Plenty times. Plenty times. You remember the number of times you find yourself up in my yard... when you go down to the police station, when you need help? - Yes, sir. - You remember the number of times I help you? - Hey? - Yes, sir. How come you know I lookin' for Ivan for the last two weeks, and you hidin' Ivan in your swamps and don't tell me? Since when another dirty criminal like yourself mean more to you than me? You believe him can help you more than me? Hey? - Answer me. You believe him can help you more than me? - No, sir. Then why the backside you hidin' him for? What is going on? You think him smarter than me... because him have a hundred places to hide, and I can't find him? It's not because him smart I can't find him. It's because you're all foolish... and all believe because I so busy chasin' Ivan now I forget about you. But I stop chase Ivan now. I gonna start chase you. All of you, and as of this week no more ganja come into this town, you hear me? Not a stick, not a spliff, not even a puff. I'm going to starve you. Let me see how much you love Ivan when your belly empty. Take one more. Film finish. - When I can get them? - About tomorrow evening. - Now. - But it will take me at least... Now. All right. Come this way. - Last one, that? - Yes. Fitz. - He's busy. - Okay. I'll wait. By the way, they catch the wild guy yet? I don't hear any news about him, but I don't want 'em catch him. I like the excitement. The boy is great! All right. You can come in. Fitz, why so quiet? - Backside! - Come. So. - Fitz, you have a pen? - Hey. - What you want a pen for? - Autograph, man. Autograph. - Right here. - Don't you have one to spare? Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Rest. This is the last one, sir. Send this one to the editor. Make sure him get it. All right. Backside. But you can't expect me not to publish a picture like this. But this is a fantastic picture. You don't want to see it? - I see you banned the record. - Yes. - And you never had the courtesy to tell me. - I don't understand you, Hilton. I called you and asked you for your help. I called you once. Am I to understand now that the police is out telling people what they must listen to? Yes, if it glorifies crime. So the record get the people all excited about this guy. He's a criminal they're gonna catch anyhow. It's no big deal. What I don't understand is when you start fooling with the hit parade. When you fool around with that then they know something is wrong. - That's when you make the guy into a big deal. - I can't stop now. I wanna talk to you. I hear you stopped the ganja trade too. - Yes, but I didn't know that interested you. - Naturally. This is the only thing that brings money to this area. You know something? No hit parade, no ganja. Hmm, you better catch him fast. Once these jokers get hungry enough to start tradin' without you, then you're finished. And then law and order finish in this entire area. You understand that, don't you? I going. See the man there. Shoot! Fire! Why you not warn me they was coming? What happened, Elsa? How him feeling? Fever gone. I thank God. If we don't have to give more blood, everything will be all right. The doctor says he must have good food. Why is the police raging? Till last night, them lock up Duffus and Midnight Cowboy. As you know, the bike sell already. What about the fishing? To tell you the truth, you know, that boat, it sell a long, long time ago, you know. Even when Ivan was here, you never had it? No. You hear from Ivan? No. I wonder how his shoulder getting on. - What time Jose coming? - Soon come. What I tell him, sir? Dollar fifty not bad. Resume. What we waiting for? Can't resume just like that. They want something more. They won't resume until they get Ivan. Anybody see him? - No. - My belly empty. My baby belly empty too. We couldn't just give up Ivan like that. Business is business, you know well, man. What do you say, Pedro? Pedro not say nothin'? Pressure don't reach him yet. Ivan. How your shoulder? Painful, you know. All right. This is supposed to drive down the pain, you know. I hear some people sayin' they catch me. No news, man. Propaganda. Pure propaganda. I sent them a picture. How come they don't publish it? Compulsory. Everything quiet. I don't like it. So what's happening in the trade? Well, most of the boys holding out. But I don't like what I hear. What? Jose. Him offer some of the boys a raise... in export. But that is what I after. Some of them get what they look for now. But now that they get what them want and nobody see me, they might forget me. No, man. Some of us still backing you, you know, to get rid of Jose altogether. But you'd better try to get away before it's too late. I'm not running, Pedro. Yes. Freddie. Him get a job on a boat. And him can get you to Cuba. And you'd get a big welcome there. Yes. Revolutionary to Ras. Could get a doctor to fix me shoulder too. True. Go down to the coast tomorrow and wait there. And the boat will pick you up at the key. All right. But I have to see Elsa and Rupert before I go. You will see them, man. You'll see them. Sitting here in limbo But I know it won't be long Sitting here in limbo Like a bird without a song Well, they're putting up resistance But I know that my faith will lead me on Sitting here in limbo Waiting for the dice to roll Sitting here in limbo Going back I have to go Well, they're putting up resistance But I know that my faith will lead me on Sitting in limbo, Sitting in limbo, ... It's all right, Rupert. Never mind. Never mind. Never mind. Well, I hope the ambulance won't come, you know. I prefer no send him to the hospital. When he comes out of the hospital, it's the same thing all over again. But, Elsa, I can't stand him cry, you know. When the trade going to start again? They want Ivan, you know. Definite. All the boys said them ready to start. What you say? I say no. What you say, Elsa? You know what I say, Pedro. Every game I play, I lose. - Yes? - I want to talk to you, sir. I was just going out. But I can spare you a few minutes. Mr. Ray, the traders don't know where him is, sir. They don't know. They don't tell me, sir. Them don't know, sir! - Hmm. - You know what gonna happen? Them gonna start without me, and I won't be able to control them 'cause them hungry now. If they start again, I'm going to lock them up. Don't matter. Them gonna start again because them desperate. If them start without me, none of us will be able to control them. Any criminal can come trade and don't have to pay no protection money. - That's your problem. - My problem, sir? Look what policeman you have, and them can't find. You want me to find him. You have a million and one policeman. Right, sir? But me one must go find him. You don't understand, Jose? I stopped chasin' Ivan now. I want the traders to bring him to me. - That is the only way this thing is going to start back. Yes? Yes, Reverend. His woman came to you for help. Okay, Corporal. Come, let's go. Come on. Start the engines. The gal said him leaving today. What boat is he leaving on? You realize if you don't help me now, you can never trade again. - You want me hit him again? - No, we're wasting time. Come. We'll get another boat. Swim, Ivan! Swim! Grab the rope! Hold on, man! Got your mind set on a dream You can get it though hard it may seem now You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want You can get it if you really want But you must try Try and try Try and try You'll succeed at last I know it We're going to do a frontal assault!

One who can draw, just come out! Shut your mouth. He think the hero can't die until the last reel? Send out one bad man! Send him out! Draw! Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down Trying to drive me underground And they think that they have got the battle won I say "Forgive them, Lord they know not what they've done" 'Cause as sure as the sun will shine I'm gonna get my share now What's mine And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall One and all Harder they come the harder they'll fall One and all Oh, yeah synced to bluray and lyric corrections by sixsnobs
