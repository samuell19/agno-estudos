From the video with the guy with the cowboy boots. Shitty house We have to keep good grades. We'll need it anyway. If not your mother will say that you can not... I wanted to study somewhere cool. In Hamburg Or... or who knows, Paris? Hey you there! Drop it right there or I'll tell Mom! Come on back with my things. Come get it! Oh no... Wait, Meike! - Hello. - Hannah. - Is everything all right? - Yes. Not now, please! But you always need me when I'm late. But... Very funny. Goodbye. Hey guys! Hannah. Hannah, I'm talking to you. Mom, I need privacy. It's just tomorrow. You know that the cosmetics congress in Schweinfurt is important to me. And of great benefit to all. Uli can't be home alone all the time besides, you will have your privacy. I guess that's a yes. So let's review something last minute. One of the proteins that is the result of photosynthesis, Ms. Meinecke, how nice you decided to join our review. Please sit down. About dry wood compounds, and other plant materials. When we burn the wood the cellulose is converted into carbon dioxide and the energy is stored. Oh, wow! A 75B. This is a classic porn. ... emerges in the form of heat... but probably can't change everything. Hanna, you seem to be very talkative today. Why don't you explain why photosynthesis is probably one of the most important biological processes on Earth. - Yes? -Photosynthesis... I'm listening. The importance of photosynthesis to the... world is During photosynthesis light energy is converted into chemical energy, forming stored carbon dioxide and stored glucose processed, while the oxygen produced by respiration forms the air we breathe Mr. Korr You can talk! And what's more.... this is a warning that this may be the last time that we hear this wise voice. If we understand the meanders of the photosynthetic process and control, maybe we could too increase crop yield using energy more efficiently. Knowing the secrets of plant energy we could apply them to artificial systems, such as solar energy. As opposed to photosynthesis, no chemical energy can be obtained... Thank you! 100, Einstein Junior. And Hannah with her worries... if she spent a little less time dating Frank. maybe she would have a little more to contribute to the lesson. Good... During the next hour, please put action... You know what I really wanted? to be a millionaire... Funny. He has a Triumph which is a pretty cool cart. Give him a chance. Meike. He has an American name. Elmar. So I think you want to see him again. Hey, give back my football. These guys... I can not concentrate here. I'll be in the library. See you. Careful. Meike, we're coming! Booo! I thought you had already gone home. No, I just saw Elmar again. He wants to study with us for the test tomorrow. I said we'll be ready by 8:00. What did you do? You have to be careful. Be careful? School is no longer enough, now that we are in a group with the best students in the class. - That's not fair. -Meike. Hang on. Say exactly what you said. I said we need his help. Yes, and now we need to do what he's saying. Hannah, he's as sweet and as timid as you. Do you know where he lives? Oh Meike. This is not a date. And if they ask if I was with you the night before the test, In a supposed work group. You set everything up. If you don't come, I'll go alone. Dear Elmar, Happy 18 years. Cheers Wow, what a big house! What shall we do? - Hey. - Hi. Over there. May I use your bathroom? There near the exit, and then to the right. Don't start without me. Please. - Want a drink? - Yes. - Coke? - Hmm. Thanks. I'm coming back. Wrong switch. Found it. They're a lot of fat cats... I knew you did not know about photosynthesis like this... please don't get me wrong You must think I'm totally crazy. No! But... What is it? What are they doing? Just a minute What's all this mess, Meike? Who are these guys? Get out of here right now! Get out of here. Thanks. Now get it over with and get out of here. It would be best if your friends left now, Elmar. When his parents arrived, he was kind of weird. Yes. Really... They were kinda unfriendly. I should know. You knew! Why? And I'm tired. Yes! Hannah, open the door. Are not you done yet? I only have one more minute. I will not be waiting in the sun. What are you doing? Max disappeared. Let me see. Give it here. Max! Ready. You have to take Uli to school today. What? Do you know how long the bus ride is from his school to mine? Mom, I have an exam and I can not be late. Hannah, we need to talk. You have not helped me with him anymore. So now I'm a nanny? Hannah! Take him and don't make me be a difficult mother! You should take on your responsibilities. Of course, but you have no idea what it is like to face all that rubbish. Thanks. Thank you in advance. Wait for Hannah, okay? She's going to take you to school. I'll call you guys before you go to bed, okay? Oh, son... Obey your sister. Mom! Hang on. - The cell phone. - Oh thank you. Sorry about that. It's Ok. He did not mean all that. Look after him, okay? Why don't you order some pizza? Oh, Mom. Please don't leave him alone, okay? It's just one day. Now go. Good luck. Thanks. Let's go. Hannah! - What is it? - On here. Take the taxi to school. - OK. -I'll be back tomorrow at 5:00. See if you stay away from the cellar. Very funny - Yes? - May I go to the restroom? Another 20 minutes. Come to the theater. Excuse me. I can go too? Thanks. Just bullshit. What? All that about photosynthesis. You should have said that you didn't know. -Did you notice that? - No No way. I don't want you to think I think you're silly. Quite the opposite. Thanks. That's all. It's all right. Yeah. It's all right. We'd better go back. I'm on my way. What is it? Hey! The siren is different. Come on, come on. What? Come, come. You have taken too long. Now you're going to sit down and finish the test. "Elmar, where were you?" All of you until we find out what's going on. Hannah, please, have a seat. This is not fire drill. It's something else. Why don't you sit down? Another 10 minutes and it will be over. It's obvious that this is not a training alarm. My dear Elmar, this is a training alarm. The sound rises and falls every 12 seconds. I can not concentrate. Can you make a moment of silence? don't you see? -Are you all crazy? - Elmar, stop! I'll report you for this! - Come with me. - Elmar! What is it? Go back to your place. Look at the clock. This is not a test. Attention this is not a test. Let's go to my house. I can't go. I have to get Uli. Who's Uli? My younger brother. He is at school. - Who's in the house? - My parents. Lend me your cell phone. Take it. - What happened? - It was the plant. Let's go this way, OK? We'll try later. Let's go. Let's get a ride. Come with me. I have a car in Wallonien. Hannah wait! Hey Meike! Do you wanna a ride? - What? - Do you want a ride? Hannah, I'm not going with them. I'm going with Siemes's mother. Good luck. Hannah, quick, come on! Can I go? There's still room. It's either take it or leave it. - Do you mind? - You have to go. Don't you? What about you? I'll get my car. If you don't go now you'll have to catch a bus. Call me. Your ride. We'll talk later. Hang on. Let me give you my number. Come on, we don't have all day. Wait for me, okay? Come on man. Do you want to increase the number of people on earth? Elmar, ?????????? ???????????? Let's hope we don't find any pigs on the way. I'm talking about cops. Put some music on. Some stupid music? Go there. It's quieter. Hey man, you gotta be kidding. Stop this! Don't get mad at me, but I have a bad feeling about it. You travel from time to time. Prepare yourselves! Faster! Good! If this was a small incident it would certainly be kept a secret. Not to cause panic. But they're all panicking and they stopped everything. And they are not following the safety standards. What are they doing? I think they're messing with a hornet's nest. Worst of alt is that we may not be the only victims so far. And water cooling works in stages. By now the last stage may already be melted. And the people? People who breathe this air have a chance of getting cancer. And that goes on for generations. This shit doesn't work !! Please, let's talk about something else. -Hello. -Elmar? - Papa.. - Can you hear me? Yes, where are you? Wait for me at the airport. Yeah, but I need to do something first. It does not matter, but... I'll go, but I'll be there in just an hour. - Elmar... - Hello? Hey, with all this trouble, why is the highway blocked? Elmar must be having trouble, too. I'm not as good as he is, but I know the way. It's going to be a fucking time. And why did we come this fucking way? I have a plane. You know my family. This is not an airplane but it pinches a hit. This proves that money and knowledge go hand in hand in life. Jannes, take your arm off and shut your mouth! How far are we from the Ebersberg Market? 70. No way! At least 80 km in a straight line. It is not bad. This is childish thing. 80 kilometers is nothing. Remember Chernobyl? Tenerife was 1500 km away. It's all a matter of time. You get to see in the small animals. And how can contaminated Chernobyl air get anywhere? Hey, we have to check the position of the wind every 5 minutes. This shit does not work! Jannes, get your paws off me or I'll fuck you! You really meant it. I just want to know where the wind is. Excuse me. Look at this. I'm already believing it. Schweinfurt should already be empty, if civil defense did their job. Schweinfurt? Yes it is Schweinfurt, Nemark, Ebersberg Ebersberg after Schweinfurt, however you wish. That must have been great shit. It really is a catastrophic collapse. In Schweinfurt they only needed gravediggers now and specialists in bone marrow transplantation. Only Schweinfurt. This is relative. What is it? My mother is in Schweinfurt today. Come in. Stop it! Stop it! We're going to Kirchberg. I want you to stop now. Mom! Out! Out of the car! - Get out of there! - Mom! Sorry folks. Okay, let's go! - 5 minutes can be crucial. - Jannes... - Hey Gustav! - Jannes! Mom, why are you doing this? Look, we didn't have school today. All because of the wind. Uli. - How nice. - They sent us home. They told us to go to the basement. - I even grated potatoes. - Great! The radio is always talking about a cloud. That the cloud is toxic, but I don't understand that. See if someone called today. I went to the cellar to get the potatoes. When I got back, everyone was gone. How can this happen? Let's go look for Mom. What about all these potatoes? More information will be provided by the police and the fire department - Potato pancakes. OK, it does not matter. I saw it on Google. ... accident in the nuclear power plant, which depends on motorways to coordinate massive traffics. The A3 motorway was particularly affected. due to a serious accident between Hammelburg and Bad Kissingen. Caller is unavailable... Schweinfurt, Oerlenbach, Bad Kissingen, Fulda. What are you doing? Now a message from the civil defense. ... temperature at the Ebersberg nuclear power plant and the detected radiation levels... ... so in some nearby area...

Schweinfurt, Bad Kissingen, Hammelburg, Fulda Bernard also said that we should go to the basement, but they all left. You can not stand here waiting for your mother. You'll see her later. I'm going. Everyone is leaving. I think so. I just... Are you afraid? Silly boy. I can't be afraid. Let's do what they said on the radio. Stay here. We'll stay in the cellar. OK? Let's go. We better go there soon. Hmmm. Take the radio for me. don't forget the food! ... make sure to keep traffic flowing... Damn it! Stay there quietly. Mom! I saw you on the balcony. We're leaving and we still have space. Thank you, Mrs. Jordan, you're very kind, but we'll stay in the cellar. Alright. Take care. Hannah? Mom. "Hannah, my dear..." - What is going on? It's okay, don't worry. We decided to stay in the basement. Everyone left. No! don't stay in the basement. It's not safe. Find Mrs. Jordan and get out of there as fast as you can. They already left. Then try the Hoffmanns. Please. Find someone and try again. But I'm waiting for Elmar. - We can save us because of his car. - Elmar? Who is Elmar? Hannah, please, Get your brother now and go! Go to Hamburg. Only for Hamburg. You can go to Kassel Until the station. Hamburg-Altona. Are you listening to me? Where are you now Mama. In Schweinfurt. At the station of the special trains.

The highway is just past the bend. We're almost there. Only you believe that. Take it easy! Hang on. You're going really fast. Attention! Please be advised that everyone wishing to pass must now use federal highway 62. What is it? There is nothing that can be done. The other highways are closed due to accidents. Do you think we're idiots? How do we get out of here in time? There is no salvation for anyone! Uli! Don't stay there in the middle of the street. Come on, come on. There is no more passage on this road! Get out of the way. I ask for your cooperation! You have to get out of the way! Let's not let it collapse! It arrived! Come come! Turn around immediately! This is so stupid! I don't want to walk anymore. Let's continue, but let's slow it down. Are they killing people? Bullshit They're shooting towards the sky. Look, Uli... Wear your hood again. Let's go... It is very hot. I'd rather be dead now. Come on, Uli! don't say that anymore! I'm thirsty now. I want something to drink or I will not ride anymore .. OK. Look. There.

Accelerate the pace! Run! Stop! the train is already full! This train is already full! Look there! You have to let us through! Susanne, stay with her! Mom! Mom! Elmar! Elmar! Elmar! Elmar! Fast! Get up! Where are the children? What happened? Tell me now! Speak! Were they there? And where did they go? See, there they are! She will return to normal. Yes, she seems to be returning to normal. We'll keep her here until we're sure. Paper, fast! Hey, it's okay. Shit! It was not for this that I became a nurse. That passes. If it were a coal plant, nothing would have happened. And they would still have stopped right at the beginning. I read that the last two Lufthansa flights offered 100,000 seats each. Come on, we have to make the beds. Shh, Shh, Shh. Let's stop this, okay? Hello. What's your name? Hey. Take a look at her! Hey, I'm Hannes. I'm taking care of you. Everything is okay, but first you must eat. OK. You are at the temporary child care center. Near Hamburg. Sorry. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. Ayse, can you help me, please? I have a little surprise for everyone. I'm Ayse. And you? Hannah. Hannah and Hannes. Coincidence. We will see a bit of variety. ... how the surrounding area will be divided in the damaged Ebersberg plant in three zones. Zone of Exclusion 1 - It is the area immediately around the reactor. Within a radius of 5 km there were no survivors, according to previous unconfirmed reports. This area should be considered, for an indefinite future, as uninhabitable. Zone 2 should not be accessed, according to the authorities, for a few years. Zone 3 consists of adjacent areas within a radius of about 50 km. Your parents have not yet been contacted. We are looking on the internet. I make lists in the network. Yes, the number is not very accurate. 38,000. This is, of course, just an estimate. We are certainly making sure that everyone else 18 German reactors are temporarily shut down. Politicians... - So we'll have to get used to it... - Beautiful images for the people to see. And now? Now, the dessert. Extensive help was promised to us. Two weeks after the accident... there are still no conclusions about the impact. Hey, how are you? Have you found out something about my mother? I'll tell you the same thing I said, okay? No news from your family, Hannah, don't worry. Now we have to pay attention to your immune system. you will be the first to know. Now go. Are you all right? Do you have a boyfriend? Do you? What's his name? Elmar. Elmar? It's a weird name. The one I like in my class is Adalbert. And another is Bertram. I'm sorry I can't be with my friend now. Do you miss him? Yes. I miss kissing him, and embracing him. Actually, just staying with him. Look, I brought you something. They bloomed in the covered patio. You have already taken your mineral infusion. It's not working. This is normal. Your body needs time to regenerate. Your white cells are so weakened that... Did you find something? I went in the internet, but I have not found anything yet. Thanks. But do you have any relatives elsewhere in Germany? Aunt Helga. She is a history teacher in Hamburg. I haven't really seen her in a long time. Hannes, I don't have any more connection with her. You can remove her from list. Didn't you say you had a boyfriend? I don't know where he is either. He would not even want to look at me. If he really loves you, it doesn't matter. Hey. It's gonna be okay. Stop it! You can't go in here! Let me go. I have to go in. Please let me go. What's going on here? Get out of here now! - Elmar? - Heim? I contacted him by message. Does he know the risk? Please. This will help you. You are of age? Yes, I'm 18 years old. I don't know what you think, however, I must inform you that there is a risk of contamination. Still, I want to see her. Röschen. We'll be back later. Don't do it. Prepare the new bed. Hannes, we need the dosimeter and Judith. Hannah... What is it? Stop looking at me like that! Elmar! Are you never alone? Yes. What is this? It's from my mother. So? She gave it to me as a gift a few years ago. My father had lots of business and I spent a lot of time alone with her. She was not very well, but it was cool. And how is she? She had a stroke. It was all of a sudden. Strokes can make the person partially paralyzed. That changed everything. My father didn't know how to handle it, and my mother was depressed and barely speaking. The ring. "Millions of years". What does it mean? Hawking. Stephen William Hawking, you don't know him? He said that definitely everything around us has a role in life. That is, exactly 66 million years ago. Then, in 66 million years, will Sontheim explode again? Yes, indeed one can argue about this theory, but... I have found a thought that makes everything easier. Because when I think... that, in 66 million years, I'll still be in a stupid library trying to figure it out, I would remember that. - And then? "Then I was going to say-" that it was the machine's fault, not man's. Is it so hard for you to believe? Aunt Helga? - It's her. - Hannah? It's my aunt. It's been so long that I barely recognized you. Hannes, this is my aunt. Honey, I thought, that you was with Paula. Yeah? And how is Paula? She's not on the list. What? What? She's not on the list. She had to be on the list! - Please. "No, no, no! - This is impossible! - Please! Now, Hannes. Give her a tranquilizer. First Uli. Now Paula. Why all this? I... I've been very stupid. Hannah. I should have paid more attention. Is not fair. I couldn't... It wasn't your fault. It was an accident. Hug me. - Let's go? - What? Where? Stop this. You planned everything. I didn't plan anything. "I've been thinking a lot. - Hmm? To send planes to write your name in the sky. A bathtub full of roses, in a room full of balloons. It must have been a drop in solar energy. It will come back soon. Dad. This is my girlfriend Hannah. What are you doing here? What you're doing is wrong. Let's go now. Now! Nothing here is wrong. You are. Elmar! They are contaminated. Come back home. Think of your mother. Why? Get out of here! Sitcom? It is a comedy. We are no longer a family. We're still at a fucking funeral. Elmar, your father is right. I also want you to stay healthy. Go. Hannah. Hannah, Go fast! Leave! Hannah! Here. For you. Antena Hamburg, 10 o'clock news. The stock index of the German DAX market is up 50 points... I spent hours in line today. I couldn't do anything all day. Accident insurance has... I don't know what your room was like with Paula, but... here you can have your own table, and a bookcase. I'm not happy in Hamburg. Well... How can I make such a bad dinner with a canned food? Please stay away from the doors. Meike. - Hannah? - Yes. What are you doing here? I'm with my aunt. I looked for you all over the internet, but you weren't on any list. It's good to see you again. Yes, you too. I got the last train. And? How are you? It's my station. Goodbye. Next stop, Onorf. ... until it passes the Y-point on the X-line Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah! Stop this! Let's meet today? She was contaminated. Yeah, and that surprised you? I'm not. You closed the window or what? I'm talking to you! Question is when will the cancer come? And you will continue to croak. Asshole! -Asshole! -Get him out of here! At 7, in the city hall market. Still not ready? In half an hour we have to be at Mannheim station. I'm not going with you. OK. Yes, it's not very far, any way. Helga. Yes? Thanks. Goodbye. Look at the Hamburger Tagblatt. Zone 3 has reopened. "Hamburger Tagblatt"? Zone 3 has reopened. Zone 3 has reopened. Read everything here. Zone 3 reopened! Is the return really safe? Thank you for yourselves. Uli was not buried. Uli... It sounds silly, but... Whenever it gets dark, I think of him. His song. Looking at me. Come here. I wish I had more time with him. Yes, but now everything will get better. In fact, I've longed...many times to bury all my past. And now I want every second to be an eternity. Elmar? Where were you? With whom? I am asking. Were you with her? I can't go to America with you. You do what I tell you to. Elmar. The air is not so cold. The sky is lower, and you, me and heavy drops fall. Oh that voice. Like the road is so long. There are many voices talking about the earth. and they talk about other things. Excuse me. Yes? - I need to leave. - Okay, go. It's all about me, again. Elmar. It's you. What are you doing here in the morning? I have to go to America. It's for my mother. It has nothing to do with you. I love you. This is not true. Three months after the opening of Ebersberg, independent experts are still discussing a return to zone 3 However, there are already thousands of people... Do you have a sewing machine? Please.

It's her. We were happy. I have to go. It's time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Are you not going to wear a sweater? The sun shines outside. Ayse! Hi, Hannah. Is everything alright? Yeah, all right. - For you. - Thanks. Oops, to top it off... Thanks. Come see my drawings. - Is that Hannes? - Yes. Nice! Thanks a lot. Elmar must be very happy to have you. Had he not accepted the situation? Well... I'm going upstairs. See how they all are. Hey! Elmar! Elmar. What are you doing? My body is very contaminated. It was only a matter of time. Why didn't you tell me? Elmar? Elmar. Elmar, I suffer from it, too. Come here. Caution Risk of radiation! Hey! I think they are growing again. What are you doing? Leaving the winter of men.
