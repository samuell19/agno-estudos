Why aren't you wearing the demon? - It doesn't align with my beliefs. - What, since when? Dude, it's gonna look stupid if we don't all match. - It's gonna look fine, okay? Relax. Just calm down. Good show. Hail Satan. - Well gotta go. - You playing any of the new stuff? [muffled singing] [tense ominous music] - Nah, nah. Just the tour set. Yeah. Okay. [thunder rumbling] [heavy metal music] Yo, hey, hey! Were you just smoking up? - Yeah. Oh, come on, man, it's not like I injected three marijuanas and now I need rehab. [chuckles] - Ramsey put a good word with the promoter. So I thought the least we could do is put a good show on for him, okay? - Come on, man, what's the point of that? - To remind everyone that Abyssinister is still a band. - You're right, man. I got you, I got you. Abyssinister! [screen whooshes] [thunder rumbling] - Hey, how much have we sold? - Uh. - Hey, dude. - Hey, what's that happening? - So shirts are 20, but for you, I could knock it down at 10. - Oh, what that shirt? - Yeah. - Aby, what?

Ooh, we've been across the pond. - Wasn't great, was it? - That chick in Greece. You still got that rash? - [Band Member 2] It itches a little but. - Yeah, I got some cream for that. - [Band Member 2] Yeah, no, you'll have to, you'll have to tell us, no? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Cool. - Good set. - [Band Member] Good set. [thunder rumbling] [lightning crackling] [suspenseful music] [group vocalizing] [Katon grunting] [Katon grunting] [group vocalizing] ♪ Abyssinister ♪ [group vocalizing] - Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! Beans! [thunder rumbling] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] - Uh. So can I just say it out loud then? - What we need to do is- - No, dude, dude, no. We heard a lifetime of your pep talks over in Europe and that still turned out so wonderful. - [Ivan] Who cares about Europe, okay? You have to give a- - Ivan, nobody, nobody is saying that you're not an ambitious guy. And you're a hell of a guitarist. There's no question. This is your band. It's your baby. But after that disaster of a tour with Cryptic Corpse, and now this. - [Ivan] Who cares about that tour? - It's the reviews, man. - Yeah. - I mean, they're brutal. They're fucking brutal. Angry Metal Guy gave us two out of five. They're laughing at us on Shredit. Invisible Oranges hated the last album. Metal Injection called it boring. Fucking boring, dude. - Flat uninspired song writing. - Fuck the reviews, okay? - I can start working at his muffin shop. - Maybe I can talk to the district 10 and see about teaching this semester. I don't know. - [Ivan] Jimmy, what the fuck? - Baphomet, please, for the last time. - Why would I call you by your stage name if we're not gonna even be a band? - Because I changed it legally, okay? So it's no longer Jimmy, it's just Baphomet. - Oh, shit, really? When? - When we got back from Europe, all right? - Well, Bophomet's got a point here, man. And that's for me, real estate ain't selling itself, Ivan. It just be nice to know where rent's coming from for once, you know? - [Ivan] Hey, hey, why did you pick up an instrument, huh? Or you? Or you, huh? If you guys are so determined to so fucking meaningless. - What's going on? - Oh, you know, it's not you it's me part. - Break up news. - Wait, you didn't tell them? - [Ivan] I've been trying to, okay? - Tell us what. - Oh. - Hey, hey. - Oh, shit. - There they are. Abyssinister. I saw the show, gentlemen. - Thanks, man. - [Ramsey] Did you tell 'em? - Tell us what? - Ivan got Fleming to produce your next record. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Fleming as in the Fleming Fleming? - That Fleming, yes. - How? - Well, Ramsey put in a good word for us. And then we wrote a lot of emails. - I'm paying him. - [Devin] Oh, Jesus, dude. How much he charge you for those guitar lessons, man? - It doesn't matter, okay? But what I do know is I'm going in the studio with Fleming producing it with you guys or without you. It is your call. - Look, I, fuck real estate, man. [chuckles] - Fuck yes. - [Bophomet] Can't argue with a confident, huh? - All right, all right, guys, let's load up the gear. The next band wants to set up. - Got more bands- - Gotta get more gear. - Hey, just between you and I, how's Ivan doing since Europe? [ominous music] [knuckles tapping] - Ivan. [doorknob clicks] Look I haven't seen you all day, I just, Ivan. Seriously? [knuckles pounding] Ivan, I'm not leaving until you open the door. [lock clicking] [door bangs] [door locks] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] I think he took all the fighting and the canceled shows and turned it into something really special is about to happen. You'll see. - Cool. Keep me posted, okay? [brooding music] [Katon yawns] [heavy metal music] - Hey, check it out. Poor dirt road. [laughs] [tense ominous music] [heavy metal music] - What, uh, what are you working on? - Sweetening the audio grabbed off the board. Figured we could put it up on the site. - Okay, well, how about you work on it later? You know, our lives are gonna be very divided in two before and after this album. Everything in my life has been leading me up to this moment and everything else just been a, been a warmup. - Everything? - Be able to get you that ring. Well, there's a sign. - It's directed at us. - [Ivan] It's the name of the studio, buddy. - Well, passed the river of no return. - Ivan, this is like hillbilly land, man. - He did say it was pretty far out there. [ominous music] [insects chirping] [door clicks] [door bangs] [birds chirping] - We're in fucking "Deliverance", man. [Devin laughing] [birds chirping] For real, huh? [Devin and Anya chuckle] This is it. [Anya chuckles] - It's awesome. - [Katon] We're in fucking "Deliverance", man. [ominous music] [insects chirping] - [Ivan] We made it. - You made it. Welcome everyone. [Fleming grunts] Nothing but a little farm, yes? You wouldn't even look twice, but the basement in a catatonic layer hidden from the eyes of the world, I built my studio, and you will be the sacrificial virgins to anoint it. - You sure, man? I mean, we're in the ass end of nowhere's ass end. - Way out here there is no disturbance. We can get fucking loud, fucking weird. That's the point, right? The closest town is a half hour drive, and it's just a little thing, only one bar. You like your fingers, don't touch my brew. [chuckles] You are living here, sleeping here, breathing music every second. Let it crawl into your DNA until you and the music are the same. You get jammed up, you take off your clothes, you run naked in the woods with a wild boar. Get strange, smell bad, do some goddamn drugs, you pussies! Act like shit bitch metal band out its fucking mind! This is my new assistant Joe. - Hi everyone. - He's a lump of clay, but he's tech smart so we give him a try. We have a space, a studio, band. Can we make a fuck shit metal album or what? - [chuckles] Okay. I'm fucking sold. This is awesome. [water squirts] [heavy metal music] - [Ramsey] Uh, the label gave us the cut list. - They wanna drop Abyssinister. - After all the stuff in Europe, you know? - Do they know we're recording? Fleming says it's the best shit he's ever heard. - Did he? - Yeah, dropping Abyssinister now would be the stupidest thing ever. - Well, perhaps I can swing a stay of execution. - Yeah, that's all I'm asking. - Only for you and only this once. [phone beeps] [birds chirping] - So what are we recording, guys? - So have you guys ever heard of the "Devil's Concerto"? All right, so when I was studying Juilliard, I heard this legend about this French composer, okay? And she was- - She? - She, okay, she was a genius violinist. But she just had no connections to royalty so she just suffered in obscurity. - I have no idea what that's like. - She burned so much to have her music be heard, that she reached out to the darkness. - She made a deal with the devil. [composer laughing] - A Robert Johnson type of thing. - Exactly. In exchange for her soul, Darkness promised that it would make her music immortal. But when the audience heard the music start killing each other in an orgy of slaughter. Now the royalty obviously had her arrested and imprisoned and then executed her. [blade whooshing] And they tried to burn every single copy of what would be known today as the "Devil's Concerto". That is, but one. - No fucking way. [book thuds] - I found a woman who had a diary written by the composer's husband, but she lived in Paris. And you know, I obviously didn't have a scratch to make the trip, but that was until we were in Europe. - So that's where you were the last couple weeks, chasing down some legend. - This is some of the most evil music ever written. What a better way to make a fucking killer album. - Than to work it in. - Yes. - So you dumb fucks are writing in the studio. - Nah, we've already got 10 songs all demoed out, all incorporated with the concerto. - Play it. Go there. - Yes. [ominous music] [woman screaming] [thunder rumbling] - Can you turn it up? What? Mom? What, what did you say? No, don't go. I, I'm sorry. I wasn't. [thunder rumbling] [Anya screaming] - Calm down, calm down! - There was a voice and it was my mother who's fucking dead. I know it was her, asshole! I would know my own mother's voice. And she said, I'm gonna, she said we're all gonna. - Are you gonna go after her? - No. - Just let her cry it out whatever the fuck that was. - Good, all right. No girlfriend drama in this studio. - Can you not start the band king horse shit, dude? Okay, I said I'd come and play the album. I'm gonna record the fucking album. Where's my fucking rig? [ominous music] - Devin, Devin. [screen flickers] [screen flickers] [wind blowing] [screen flickers] [thunder rumbling] [screen flickers] [screen flickers] [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [slow tempo drum music] - In time. Take your rhythm pills. - Devin. What the fuck? - Oh, don't get that shit on the carpet. - [chuckles] Fuck. What? [grunts] - [Fleming] Who told you to stop? - Hold on, hold on, I broke a stick. - Bringing old sticks to the studio, real pro, slap fuck. - I just bought 'em. [slow tempo drum music] - Devin. [voice echoing] - Oh, W the fuck, man. Jesus. [chuckles] [ominous music] [metal crashing] [heavy metal music] - Baphomet. All right, listen. So what do we call this music? - Old school Swedish death metal. And formed by a second wave black metal with elements of Sabbath worship. - So you are playing 90's sweet death with no HM-2s. - No, it's more of an influence than a homage. - I always thought we were playing doom with a slam edge. I mean, it's clearly not true cult. - Or is it trve kvlt? - I thought it was tech deathcore with trad influence. - [chuckles] Yes, somebody should have told me we weren't new metal black and thrash powerful. Or is it a try hard Behemoth I can't tell. [Fleming laughing] - Ha, ha. Look, come on, let's get back to work, all right? [ominous music] [heavy metal music] - Everyone take 15. We need to dial this in. [button beeps] - Hey. - Hey. - So I talked to Ramsey. Anything that we can send the label that'll get them excited would be awesome. And as soon as we can, even if it's just, you know, rough. - Rough. Hmm. When you've done this for as long as I have, you know, right away if it's good or if it's shit. And I have to say this, this has potential to be good. Great. Classic. But do not tell them I said that. They'll get lazy and full of themselves. Our secret. [Shadia chuckles] The legend thing is bullshit. But the concerto, ah, [tense ominous music] this is the special sauce. What am I saying? You've probably heard this a million times. - No, Ivan's been very, uh, he wanted to keep it a surprise for all of us, I guess. - Hmm. - Just the label. [brooding music] [tongue clicking] [mouse clicks] [heavy metal music] - You hear that? You don't hear the fucking track playing or anything? - Nope, nothing. - What the hell is that? - Fleming.

I know he's got a lot of riding on this, but, uh, yeah. [ominous music] [heart pounding] [wood bangs] - Anya! [Anya gasps] You were right. We're all grotesque.

Look, look, no, it's gonna be all right, okay? Look, I can play the bass part and everything will be fine. Okay, it's gonna be great. - Fucking dare you! [hand slaps] [Ivan groans] - What? Look, I was just saying. What? [Shadia crying] What, hey. -Stop it, stop. [Ivan panting] You know, if I would've hit you like that, then I would've been considered the abusive monster. Just get outta my way. [insects chirping] [dramatic music] Hey, hey, who saw this, huh? Hey, hey why would he do this? Why would he do? Fuck. Oh my God. [phone beeps] [tense ominous music] [phone beeps] - What exactly just happened there? - [Joe] I'll try inside. - Where's the bus? Who moved the bus? Who moved the goddamn bus? - I did not move the bus. - It didn't just magically grow wings- - My- - And fly the fuck away. - Truck is gone! Okay, rockstar you're so hot to cut this album, you didn't want anyone to leave. - Hey, I was in the studio. - Wait. - Okay. - Wait, okay, earlier I saw someone out here, a woman. - What woman? - I don't know who she was. I saw her right after I unloaded. I thought she was with you. - The only person who was with me is Joe. And Joe was working. Shadia, what were you doing out here by yourself when you saw this woman? - I was talking to Ramsey. - About? - Nothing works. - Don't be an idiot. - The lights are on, the computers are on. We have signal. I tried landlines, Skype, internet calls, emails, texts, everything I do get this. [tense ominous music] - I'm fucking leaving. Not staying a second on this farm. - Hang on. - [Anya] I'm going. - I know I'm coming too. - Fuck that shit. I'm not leaving here, and coming back, and find my equipment gone too. - You know what? Let's just wait till morning, okay? Please, please. [flesh tearing] [woman screeching] - I should stay. - I'm not letting her go alone. - Fine, Lancelot, go to the main road, turn right. Walk until you get to town. Try the bar. Maybe they'll still be open. - Come back with the cops. - Which of us is more doomed? - Shut up, drums. [ominous music] [Ivan panting] - It was right here. Get down. [brooding music] Come on. Greet your teeth. [Ivan grunting] [Ivan panting] How did you get this? We said things, okay? We, we were upset, which is understandable since that, all of this, but we've always been there for each other, right? No matter what. That's what we always say, right? There's something going on with you. And I'm, I'm alone right now in a way I haven't been in a long time. I mean, not since. - Once this album's done, okay, we're gonna turn the page. - You, you, you still think you're gonna make this album? - Devin was my best friend, I think he'd understand. [woman screaming] I'm sorry, I have to go to work, okay? [insects chirping] [wind blowing] - Do you think they hate me now? - What? No. - I couldn't stay there with, with Devin lying there. Do you think he, he did it because he found out? - About us? No, no. You can't think like that. This is Devin we're talking about, right? I mean, if he found out, he'd slug me, but we'd be drinking beers an hour later, right? - Yeah, I guess. - Now it's just us. - Don't sound too happy. - I was just- - You know, you're just weird sometimes, okay? This whole me, you, us thing, it's not like we even put- - Holy shit. Fucking Ivan. Whatever, it doesn't matter. Come on. [ominous music] Even. - Katon! Katon! [suspenseful music] [Devin laughing] [Anya whimpering] [Devin laughing] [Anya panting] [branches rustling] [Devin laughing] [Anya whimpering] [Devin laughing] [ominous music] [Devin laughing] [Devin laughing] [Anya panting] [Devin snarling] [tense suspenseful music] - Anya? [woman screaming] Anya! - Anya. [voice echoing] [voice chattering] [voice chattering] [voice chattering] [voice chattering] [voice chattering] [brooding music] - Your friend lies dead in the dirt outside. And here you are back to work. - Hey, I didn't tell Devin to go hang himself. You know what, I got better shit to do until the cops get here, okay? - Sure. Life, death doesn't matter. We are all just bugs crawling on a rock in space. - Yeah. Unless you do something so your name will live on forever. - Ah, that's what your after, immortality. Why? Who cares if the bugs remember? - So what am I supposed to do, old man, huh? What we should do is dedicate this album to Devin. [suspenseful music] [Ivan gasping] [Ivan gasping] [flesh squishing] [Anya groaning] [insects chirping] - [Shadia] Show me. - No, no. [Ivan groaning] - [Shadia] What's going on? Show me. Come on, come on. Show me. Ivan, come on. You have to get up. Come on. - No. - It's okay, it's okay. - [Katon] You cursed us. - What? - The music's cursed. We're cursed because we heard it. You made us play it, you son of a bitch. We have to destroy it. [Ivan grunting] [fist thuds] [fist thuds] [Ivan grunting] [paper ripping] - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. - [Shadia] Where's Anya? - The curse got her. - Katon, get your shit together and make sense. Did you leave her out in the woods by herself? - The curse got her. - What is the matter with you? We have to go and find. [ominous music] [Shadia gasps] How did you get these bites? - That isn't Anya. - I'm so hungry. - Katon, what, what did you do? - That isn't her. - Huh? These aren't animal bites, Katon, what the fuck did you do? - So hungry. [teeth crunching] [Katon grunting] [door bangs] [doorknob jiggling] [door thuds] [Anya grunts] [body whooshing] [Joe groans] [body thuds] [Anya hissing] [Bophomet screaming] [flesh tearing] [group yelling] [door bangs] [group panting] - That was fucked up. [insects chirping] [water splashing] - Getting haunted in real life fucking sucks. - We're not haunted, the music is. - Oh, of fuck sakes. It's not ghosts, it's not cursed music. And it's not Satan. I think someone slipped us some shit and now we're tripping and we don't even know it. - Who do something like that? Ivan? - No, I'm telling you, there was a woman creeping around out there. - A woman? A fucking woman. Where's your boyfriend? - Your guess is as good as mine. - We gotta get outta here. - I saw the bus in the woods. - Can you find it again? - I, I won't send you to die. - Katon, goddammit! - Okay, I am done with you people. In the morning you punks walk your asses to town. Meanwhile, I hear by kick everyone out who is not me. - You're staying in here with her. - Out! Now go! The day I worry about a woman is the day I burn my boots. [insects chirping] [wind blowing] - I've got a spare key. - Katon, there's a first aid kit in the washroom. - [Katon] Oh. [water splashing] Oh, ah. - We have to find Ivan. - What, why? - Well, I have to at least. - No, no. Splitting up is a terrible no good, very bad idea. - Okay, well, come with me. It's still Ivan. Your guitarist. Your friend. - Still some beer in the cooler. - Hail Satan. - Yeah. [insects chirping] [Anya chattering] - Ah! Slap your teeth shut, weirdo! [ominous music] [insects chirping] [Katon panting] [screen screeches] [Katon panting] [screen screeches] [screen screeching] - Ah, fuck. Ah, ah. Oh, fuck. [screen screeching] [Katon groaning] [Katon groaning] [screen screeching] [Katon groaning] Fuck. [blood dripping] [screen screeches] [screen screeches] Oh, stop. [screen screeches] Stop. [Katon groaning] [Katon screaming] [flesh tearing] Oh, fuck! [Katon groaning] [Katon groaning] [ominous music] [Katon groans] [flesh tearing] [blood splattering] [Katon screaming] [Katon groaning] [Katon laughing] [Katon laughing] [insects chirping] [door clicks] [woman screaming] [ominous music] - Ivan? [Ivan screaming] Ivan? [Ivan screaming] It's, it's okay. It's okay, it's, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know. [flesh tearing] [ominous music] [Ivan groaning] - Why did you do that? - I, I didn't. - What? Then who did? Ivan, who did this to you? [Ivan groaning] [high pitched humming] - It's all I can hear. It's the curse. - There is no fucking curse. - Look at me. They told me when I found the concerto that immortality would come with a price. She's in my dreams. And she, and she shows me things. She shows me horrible things all the time. The composer. - The composer of the concerto? - But this people who sold it to me, they said, "That, that, that there's a way to reverse the curse." Look, look, look, look. You see her, you see her? There she is, there she is, there she is. Do you see her? No. No, I'm not gonna let him take you. - Ivan, look, I really think we should. [woman laughing] Ivan. Ivan. Ivan. [insects chirping] All this time I thought that Ivan was writing for the album. He hide that from me like it was important. And it's just, he's just gone wrong. I, I think he's still in there, you know, in his head. But I, I I don't know if I can. - Okay, okay. - Or if he can. - [Bophomet] All right, well, where, where is Ivan right now? - That's a good question. That's a hell of a fucking question. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Shh, shh, shh. - He, Ivan was there and then he was gone. I turned around for one second. - Okay, okay, it's gonna be all right. Look at this. How could Ivan have known that, that that thing in Anya? We have to get outta here. - As soon as the sun comes up. - No, no, no. Ivan foresaw Anya, okay? And there are other drawings, all right? We are not safe. - Maybe you can have Satan protect us. - You know what I'd buy that we are experiencing a, a reflection of our collective ids channeled by a heretofore undiscovered psychic energy before I point fingers at our dark lord. But it is probably not a drug. - Okay, let's get Katon. - And Ivan? - Hopefully. [ominous music] [wind blowing] [blood dripping] - You killed me. - You tried to kill me first. - I want you. - You are either a hallucination or a ghost. Either way fuck off. [brooding music] [voice chattering] [tense ominous music] [Fleming gasps] [woman screaming] [Fleming screams] [Anya and Fleming grunting] [Fleming grunting] [Anya grunting] [Fleming groaning] [bones cracking] - [Composer] Fleming. - Fleming. [voice echoing] [insects chirping] [wind blowing] - No, no. Anyone but her please. Anyone but her. [ominous music] Are you sure? [Ivan laughing] She loves me. [laughing] She'll believe anything [laughing] I say. [Ivan laughing] [Ivan laughing] [curtain rattling] [woman screaming] [ominous music] [voice chattering] [horn honking] - Guys, that's the bus. [woman chattering] Guys, that's the bus. [woman howling] Guys. [suspenseful music] [wind blowing] [ominous music] - Where the hell did he go? [ominous music] [heart pounding] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [woman screaming] [brooding music] [ominous music] - Um, um, when I found Ivan, I turned around for one second and he was gone. Do you see this? It's just this piece, but backward. Reverse. Ivan said, "That there was a way in the music to reverse the curse." - I guess we need the concerto and Ivan has that with him. - No. Come on. [wind blowing] [insects chirping] [woman screaming] [Joe panting] - Oh no. [blood dripping] Oh, Jesus. [blood drips] [ominous music] [insects chirping] [tense ominous music] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] It tried to take me. [knuckles pounding] - [Shadia] Fleming. It's Shadia. - And Joe.
