That's fine. Lieutenant Harris I figured you turned in at least an hour ago, I wanted to give these thermo reading another thorough check out Bill Why is there something wrong with them Sir? Not really. I don't think it's anything to worry about. We had some strange temperature readings during the early shift. From the sub station up on Mount Kanchenjunga? Sorry Sir, I didn't notice it in the log. I didn't enter it in the log. It only lasted a few minutes. Funny. The overall area temperature jumped up nearly 50 degrees. - 50 degrees. That's not possible. - That's just the point. If I reported a reading like that to HQ, they'd say we were crazy. That reading was probably due to a circuit failure. By the way, Gamma One telcom reported some good news this evening. We're all due for a little vacation from this freezer. We've got full leave? General Norton has approved Commander Jackson's new schedule. - About time. - Imagine being able to open a door and walk out of Harris' deep freeze. I'll draw up a list for leave, in my quarters if you need me. Besides I want to let Lisa know about the leave. Get down. Get damage control on the double. I want that hole patched and fast. Haven't you located Lt. Sanchez yet? We've been trying. She should be in telcom any moment. Here she is now Sir. Stand by. Lt. Sanchez. There's a call for you. It's from General Norton's aide. You have three channels. Lt. Sanchez, Sir. Yellow signal stand by. For General Norton please. - What's this about? - I haven't a clue. I've been trying to reach Commander Jackson directly. But he doesn't answer. Isn't he aboard? No Sir. Commander Jackson and Captain Polasky used a supply rocket on its return to Space Control last night. Just why are Jackson and Polasky not at their stations? They are both on a week's leave Sir. Under the new rotation plans they have to take their leave when it's their turn whether they want to or not. Of course, I'm sorry. You're quite right. It's important I speak to Jackson. I know it interrupting his leave, but I must. Locate him. And have him contact me here at HQ. Of course. Certainly Sir. - That's nonsense. - Yes Lieutenant. - Commander Jackson left this with me. - What is it? A list of places where he might be reached in case of emergency. How interesting. I think General Norton counts as an emergency. Yes Lieutenant. Of course. I'll say one thing about this list of places. He won't be bored. I guess not. I'll set up the telecircuit. I was afraid something like this might happen. So I put the list on code cards last night. Yes? Just a moment please. Excuse me Countess, a call for the Commander. Hello. Who is calling Commander Jackson please? It's Telcom Centre, Gamma One. This is official business/ He's not here, but we are having cocktails later. If the Commander calls, I'll gladly give him a message. That's quite alright Countess. I'll get him at another number. Gamma One to Commander Jackson. - Gamma One to Commander Jackson. - Excuse me please. Commander Jackson please. I'm so sorry. Commander left an hour ago. - He didn't say where he was going. - Thank you. Commander told me you speak my tongue. I consider this a truly, singular pleasure. One seldom finds people so learned. I think Commander is at Jordan club. - Hi Remy. - Hi show off. - Did you get him? - He's still showing off. - You might catch his eye - I prefer the eternal triangle. - Your turn - I know, don't rush me. - Yes? - Commander Jackson. One moment. - It's for the Commander. - He's here. Commander, there's a call. It's for you. I guess that's it for today. Just hold on there a moment Rod. You're not going to get away with that. Captain Polasky Are you accusing your commanding officer of abandoning his position? - In a word, yes.. - In that case... The call can wait. And let it be a lesson to you. does the senior commander remember what he said? He promised to take me along some time soon to visit Gamma One if I defeated him 6 times in a row. - You promised. - A promise is a promise. I won't forget. What about the telephone? I bet our vacation just ended. Commander Jackson. Flight a-37. On programmed approach to Space Central. Polar Course at 3,000 knots. Flying jet channel A at 95,000 ft. - Flight conditions normal. - Very good. May I have your E.T.A.? We make it 15:25 hours our time. Thank you. Space Central out. Jackson A-37 out. What the big problem? What did General Norton tell you? Nothing really. Something to do with weather conditions. One thing I do know. the General broke up a swinging romance. I had everything set. That's what happens when you volunteer for space duty, Frank. That's right skipper. We should be reaching the polar camp about now. Think I'll make a visual check. Boy, that's peculiar. Rod, take a look at that. I guess Norton was right about peculiar weather conditions. That's strange. I've never seen those glaciers behave like that before. Earthquake? I couldn't say. Let's try another area. Looks like the whole arctic is beginning to crack open. Let me have the area charts. You don't have to look at them. - What do you mean? - The charts won't help. They won't show any river of that size up here at the pole. I'll take a reading. Willie, plot a survey. I want you to turn in a report to Central Weather. Our information shows the melting of the cap isn't due to any change in the Earth's orbit. Nor to any change in the Earth's axis. The temperature rise in the arctic results from some high energy proton field. which creates near plasma conditions. Our analysis has pinpointed the origin of the field. An area... that borders India and China, high in the Himalayas. - Right about here. - The Himalayas? - Are you certain of that? - Yes Sir. These force field emanations. Would they be originating - in the vicinity of Mount Kanchenjunga? - Why, yes. Stevens come here and bring the casts. I'll be right there General. - You've heard of Indus. - The weather reporting station. Here are some clips made by the special team we sent to the station. This is what the squad saw when they entered the station. Every man there was dead. Murdered! The only person unaccounted for is the Commanding Officer, Lt. Harris. There was no sign of him anywhere. He's listed as missing. Presumed dead. Some unknown horror smashed through that window. Whatever or whoever came through that window took the station by surprise. It killed the men, then smashed the place so it was useless. It's just senseless. Rampaging of a wild animal. And a most unusual animal. Professor, this is Commander Jackson. And Capt. Polasky of Gamma One. Professor Stevens of our zoology department. And his assistant, Lisa Nielsen. This way. Take a look at this. See anything like it before? It's the only trace there is. - They found this at Indus? - Just by the smashed observation panel. I've made a model of the foot based on that cast. We can be sure the creature was large, 300 pounds, seven feet tall. Heavy body fur. And that its foot was like this. - Is this a known species? - Not exactly. But legends persist, of a very strange race in those great mountains. They're called Yeti... Snowmen. At times, something lures them down the Himalayan heights. And drives them mad. Too bad Harris isn't alive to prove your theory. - I'm sorry Professor. - Don't bother with it. - Lisa, take the rest of the day off. - Thank you Sir. Miss Nielsen and Lt. Harris were engaged to be married. Poor kid. I want you two to take this case. We're ready Sir. Are you going in the import business Frank? In my small way. - Find out anything? - Yeah. For one thing... - Everyone know we're here. - Good. Just what I wanted. It's just as well we create suspicion in a place like this. What kind of a story did you spread around? You are a scientist from UDSCO. And you're getting an expedition searching for evidence of snow devils. Up there. Wonderful. Did you check out the helijet? - And the porters? - Taken care of. On a stand by basis. Why have porters if we're using a helijet? To make the whole thing look authentic. To make people think we are only checking the best climbing route. - Let's hope they believe it. - Why shouldn't they? Isn't this where the whole legend began? Up there. Isn't that where... the snow devils are supposed to live? Tomorrow we may find out whether... the snow devils... Really exist. May I Commander Jackson? Welcome to Gerandi. We are honoured. Caption Polasky. This is Sharu, assistant at the local U.D. He's in charge of the porters and knows his mountains very well. Thank you. We appreciate your help. I'm delighted to be of service. May I suggest to the Commander that he leaves all arrangements for the expedition to me? I'm sure the Commander and Captain Polasky have had a long trip. Perhaps a little relaxation. I could arrange something for the Commander. I'm afraid we haven't come here to relax. We have a saying. He who travels the path of the tiger must travel light... of mind as well as light of foot. We can't argue with an old proverb Rob. I just hope the tiger believes the same thing. - So this is night life in Gerandi. - Just about. Did Harris or any of the weather station personnel ever get down here on leave? Not very often. The station was pretty isolated. What's on your mind Frank? I was thinking about Harris. I was wondering if he could make it down here alone. You really think he could have managed to escape when the station was attacked? You know, Harris might be wandering these mountains right now. Without any food or a thermal suit. He wouldn't last long in this weather. I'm afraid you're right. There's not much chance he's still alive. You're wrong Commander. - Jim Harris is not dead. - Lisa Nielsen! What are you doing here? And would you mind explaining what you just said? I'm not going to give in. I say he's still alive. What makes you think he's alive. when the others died? I don't know. Call it woman's intuition, ESP or whatever you want. But But I know Jim just isn't dead, up on that mountain. What will you do about your hunch? I know you're all looking for something, that could be affecting the weather. How do you know that?= You forget that Professor Stevens is cleared for Top Security and I also get it as his assistant. So? I came here Sir... Because I want you to take me on your expedition. But that's impossible. I won't be in your way. Please! I'm sorry Lieutenant. I'm under orders. It would take more than you or orders to stop me. I'll get up there... somehow. - That was pure bluff. - I hope so for her sake. Commander Sahib, there's been a calamity. - What's wrong? - Come Commander. Your own eyes shall tell you. - D'you think there's a chance? - Look Commander. Damn. There goes our helijet and our expedition. - Can you explain this? - I have watched the helijet carefully. One moment all was still. The next... It was like black magic. I've got a better word for it. Sabotage. You could be right. This changes things. But not very much. We can't get another helijet up here. We'll just have to go in by foot. You mean our porters? But that was just a cover. Only you and I know that. Unusual weather conditions are reported in many parts of the globe. Results of the freak weather have been visible in many major cities. In Holland an increase in the level of The North Sea has caused flood conditions in most of the low lands. In Peru, special monitor teams have observed unusually early break up of snow in the Andes, causing dangerous avalanches. Similar conditions have been reported in Switzerland, Alaska, the Ural Mountains. That's enough. Turn it off. - It's really developing. - It is. A definite climatic shift in Polar and Alpine areas. And we'll face world wide flooding if this continues Sir. Any word from Jackson? Last Telcom report at 18:30 has Jackson starting up the south slopes of Gori Sanda on foot. On foot? Why doesn't he use a high altitude helijet? Signal him. Tell him to stop that stupid alpine club stuff. I'm sorry Sir, but the helijet was destroyed. It was possibly destroyed by sabotage and we have no time to send him another. Send him a message anyway. But wish him luck. He'll need it. Hold on! Come on. Get up! Thank you Sahib. Thank you. Alright. Get back in line. Frank, this is a good spot. HALT! Over here. Down here. Come on. When we're set up, we'll make a report to UDSCO. At 10.000 foot mark. Thermograph reading normal so far. No unusual instrument activity. No sign of missing UDSCO officer. No sign of snow devils either. Will report again at 05:30. Jackson to HQ, out. Rod, if we should run into one of those abominable snowmen... What do we do? Good night. Commander. - What is it? - We have trouble with the men. They say it is too dangerous to go any further. They won't go on. What shall we do? They knew everything when they signed up. - Are they afraid of avalanches? - They've seen those before. It is the unseen they fear. The snow devils. Tell; the men they have nothing to fear if we all stick together. - But Sahib... - Tell them double wages from no on. Perhaps. What is it now? Come on, move. The Commander will want to see you. Come here quick. - More trouble Commander. - Well? What is it? What's the matter? This porter. I found him straying off. - Don't you follow orders. - Probably doesn't speak English. - A stubborn one. - Let's have a look. A female, Sahib. How did she get here? On the sacred bones of my ancestors, I'm innocent. It's not his fault. He had nothing to do with it. A stowaway. There were a lot of bundles waiting to be carried. I just took one. And joined the line. What'll we do with her? We can't send her down alone. Nor spare one of the men. You don't have any choice. I'm here to stay. Alright you'll stay. But since you want to be a porter... Rod, take it easy. See she earns her keep and carries her weight. Wouldn't it be just as easy. A little push into a crevice... - Come on. - I just have a simple mind, Sahib. One that solves simple solution. White snow leopard. Screams like a woman. Nothing to worry about. Rod, Patrick, Henry, Terence. I looked up your background in central space records before I left. Where is White River Junction? It's a small town in Vermont. Ski country. Quiet, clean. - Nice, uncomplicated there. - Sounds real nice. - Is that where you grew up? - More or less. I lived with my aunt and uncle after my parents died. My uncle used to take me fishing in the spring. He always wanted to be a space man. They called them astronauts in those days. All he ever got to do was help me, build models of those early rockets. Then high school, the Space Academy and a commission. Alpha Two control station, the Martian expedition and now Gamma One. How do I like my steaks? Rare over charcoal, burned on one side. With a side order of sprouts. Or is it sauerkraut? - And then french fries. - You're quite a girl. - Rod... I... I don't... - Lisa... I know you love Jim Harris. I know you're lonely, tired and scared. You needed someone to comfort you. I just happened to be around, that was all. - Now you go to sleep. - Thanks Rod. - What is it? - The porters are all gone. Skipped off during the night. We can't get far without them. We've got to go on. We've got to, Rod. Alright. You'll go as you are. We'll need only the essentials. Take only what can be carried comfortably. Let's go. Come on. There seems to be a shelter ahead. Against the wind, it should be good shelter. Come on. This looks like a good spot. We'll remain until after the storm. Let's take a look. Come on. Miss Lisa. Do not wander off. Rod, look. the footprint. Over there. That's Sharu Through here. Sharu, where are you? Look out! Get back. I can't make it. Rod, Frank... Are you alright? Lisa get a hold of yourself. Frank, are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK, except for a king sized lump. - And You Sharu? - I'm alright. Then these monsters exist. My people were right. I'm glad they let us keep our thermal suits. It's freezing in here. But this is impossible. Look. Such huge machinery. It must have taken many years to build all of this. To install it. All this stuff hidden away and UDSCO never even knew. But who can have built these machines? Certainly not the abominable snowmen. Their minds must be on a par with prehistoric man. Whoever is responsible for all this must have an intelligence capable of advanced science. You're right Rod. The big brains must have trained the snowmen to do menial, tasks. But it couldn't be anything too hard. The snowmen wouldn't be smart enough to know anything about machinery. Oh, really? It's amazing how you can be so positive. And still be so wrong. You are so wrong about so many things. The way you stare, I can only assume you are wondering how an ape man can be so intelligent. You still think of me as a sub human abominable snowman. But you are wrong about that too. What you all fail to understand... is that I and my people are not descendents of the ape because we are not of your planet. You are aliens? From another world? My world. Athier. Fifth planet from our sun in another solar system. Most of Athier land mass is covered by ice and snow. Sub zero temperatures are normal to us. So we Athians have developed protective body hair. Just as your polar bear has. Our people built a great civilization on Athier made up of the chosen elite. Then our scientists and astronomers learned that our entire solar system was drifting, and would eventually move into a field of radioactive cosmic dust, that would kill all alike. We faced the alternative of moving all life on our planet underground, knowing that once we did so we could never again emerge upon the surface of our world. Or else finding a planet, whose density gravity and atmosphere was like our own. Your planet Earth met these specifications, except for one thing. Your climate. Of course. You said your people. lived in sub zero temperatures. Exactly. Our scientists managed to develop machinery that would change your climate. so that we could eventually come here to colonize your world. Then you are the ones who are melting the polar caps. I don't understand. Why heat the poles when you want to freeze everything. Because we first wanted to have most of the Earth flooded. then and only then would we lower the temperature. So that the water would freeze over and the Earth would be covered by one great glacial field. You arrived at a most appropriate moment. It is time for me to reverse the temperature so that Earth will start freezing over. Stop. One more step and I'll kill the female. Then the rest of you. Human, human life doesn't mean much to you. Yours certainly doesn't. It might interest you to know that all this does not supply the energy. by which we can change Earth's weather. Actually, this is only a relay station. Our power source is at a secret base, where our scientists are hard at work. By your standards it has taken us nearly 100 years to transport the necessary machinery here. You've been here nearly 100 years? Of course. That was when the first snow devil tracks were discovered. It was then the legend began. Naturally there were times when some of us emerged from this cavern to patrol the area for intruders. And to perform other chores. Such as attacking the weather station. And sabotaging our helijet. What about Lt. Harris? Is he dead? Did you kill him too? Do you know anything about him? Please tell me. I beg of you. You're alive. I knew you were. And even after the station was knocked out of commission, he kept me alive. to pump me and to make sure he hadn't slipped up somewhere. That's the only reason he didn't have me killed. If his plan succeeds, we'll all be expendable. - Along with the rest of the human race. - Man is finished. All his dreams, all his plans. Ended. A new species will take over. Man will be extinct. This is the twilight... of our world. Is this a wake? Maybe the rest want a funeral service but not me. - Take it easy Frank. - Let's get out of this place. What's that? An air duct? Yes, the whole place is air conditioned to keep the temperature at a level they can tolerate. Give me a hand Frank. Lisa guard the door. Lisa, come here. Come on. Here, come on. Careful. Don't make a sound. There's a grating ahead. There's nobody. Give me a hand. Not a sound. This must be one of their supply rooms. But it's mostly Earth stuff. He probably had it stolen in order to study it. There must be something in this room we can use against those monsters. Nothing here. Hey, maybe we could make a bomb with this stuff. - That's possible. - Good. A bomb could really damage their weather machinery. Maybe destroy it completely Use that mask and keep looking. What kind of acid is there in a battery? Sulphuric acid. So what? So this. If you dehydrate ethyl alcohol by sulphuric acid You come up with a tricky compound called ether. Ether. This whole place is air conditioned. which means there are air ducts leading to every room. With ether we can put them all to sleep. Wait a minute. You're forgetting something else. We'll all be put to sleep too. We'll accomplish nothing. Not if we use these gas masks. Come on. Don't move. Come on. Get up here. My eyes... my head. The earth people. They did this somehow. I'll stop them. I'll destroy them I'll destroy all of you. Look out Frank. Easy, easy there. Jim, there should be enough material here for you to rig up a transmitter. I want to contact General Norton. What if we can't get through? If I know the General well enough he's programmed us a search unit. - Don't forget this Sir. - Forget what? Oh, thanks. Reckless driver. Tried to tell you. Your identities please. Your identity cards please. Hello Jackson. Sit down. - Glad to see you pulled through again. - Thanks to you Sir. For picking us up. The importance of this meeting will soon be apparent. I'm sure a few of you already suspect the reason for it. These... these tapes are incomplete, but they tell a strange story. Jackson wiped out their installation in the Himalayas, but these strange weather phenomena continue. You remember what that hairy ape said about a secret base? Yeah. I realise why the old man sent for us again. Rivers have reached record levels. This is the port of Nagasaki. The city's worst flooding in history can't be explained as a typhoon. Especially during what should be their dry season. The situation hasn't yet been classified as dangerous. But it won't be long. The polar cap is melting. Quite unaccountably and at a phenomenal speed. Here's something interesting. In reconstructing the words spoken by the head of those people, there's no doubt there's a base they're working from right now. McClaren, make copies for all units. Thank you. Doctor, what would be the total effect if the polar ice continues to melt at this alarming speed. Just the north Pole would be bad enough. If the South Pole too, floods of course. Now such phenomena must be excluded, General. there's more to it than that. It's not normal. General, you called this meeting as all weather stations and personnel are under your command. This looks like a much bigger problem than just weather. What exactly can we do? Firstly stop pushing the panic button. For now, we'll concentrate on the source of the problem. Commander Jackson, Gamma One is the best weather station of all. I want you to get the entire weather station personnel at work on this right away. Certainly Sir. You might as well brief yourself Commander. This is a copy of reports and readings that have been sent to Gamma One. I want two secretary units with Gamma One. Yes Sir, I'll send a videotel immediately. As for you Commander, I wish your assignment was just as routine. You found out what's wrong with the weather station. But now you've got to find the answer for a whole planet. Here's Commander Jackson with Neptune T-43 - J load. - Up to speed. - Electric implants Sir. - First sections phased in. Second section phased in. third section phased in. - Green and activated. - Slates on automatic. Systems to auto. Programmed to neutralise 10G. To burn out at first phase. Are we set? You are scheduled in pink with station ground computer for programmed takeoff. Saint to computer. Place static energy level at maximum. Control auto fire from here. Auto countdown to begin. Ten... nine... eight... five... four... three... two... one... ignition. You're on course 2-0-5. Good trip Commander. How's the final approach to the station I'll check the course. It's right on target skipper. Ready for instrument landing. This is Commander Jackson on 2-0-5 on final approach to Gamma One. Here Gamma One. We read you oral and visual. Welcome home. You're right on course Sir, but two degrees left of centre of your SPA run/ - Correcting Verniers. - Correcting course 2 degrees. Stand by to switch all manuals to auto on my signal. - Standing by. - Activated. Functioning. Stand by to receive space tugs. Run it again. - Any clues yet? - No Sir. Radar negative for all quadrants. Same for astronomy. Weather stations, flood conditions getting worse. Computer section third run of all data completed, but nothing yet. - Predictions... - I can imagine. Don't let up. Keep at it. Well? Sleep tight. - Sensor reading on quarter hull. - Check out. We've got it! We've got it! - Let's see. - Let's hope it's the real thing. Commander Jackson. Priority circuit. - Yes? - We've got something interesting. Radar computers have zeroed in on something. The data fits that of our space analysis. Shows the possibility of life on Callisto, Jupiter's satellite. Good. Run a duplicate of the findings and have it ready in 20 minutes. Frank have that 2-0-5 ready to go up as soon as we have that report. Terry, get a signal off to the General. Tell him I need three ships with blaster cannons - Rendezvous is on Jupiter co-ordinates. - Yes Sir. Rod, we'll have the drinks when you get back. Thanks, it's a deal. But remember, light on that vermouth. Rendezvous completed Commander. Fleet is in battle order. Proceeding on programmed course to intercept target moon of Jupiter. Radar station reports meteor cluster ahead. Big ones. Shall we change course? No. Changing course now would only delay us. Let's knock them out, hoping we don't miss any. Signal for a weapons test on that cluster. Follow it, changed to super eon drive at 90% when completed. Yes Sir. We're all ready Captain. The rockets are positioned. Ready for rocket salvo. Not yet. Now! Now we can button down for eon drive. Sound acceleration stations and switch to drive. as soon as go condition of all boards is green. They're moving so fast, it's difficult to maintain alignment. When will they reach the target area? Possibly in an hour at their present rate. It always startles me when I realise that what we see on the screen is altered by time and space and actually happened minutes before. And that it would take the same time to send them any new instructions. Let us hope there won't be any need for any new instructions. The big one, Jupiter. What a giant. It seems to blot out the sky. There's your target Commander, right on the dot. The advance base. Callisto. Callisto. Nobody would ever think they were there. Something wrong d'you think? Yeah, it's too easy. We're set to blow them out of the sky and there's no sign of resistance. Look. They must be hiding inside that rock. But I'll admit it's pretty quiet. They're there alright. But we'll send out a scout ship. They may have something cooking we can't from here. Scouter section... - Scouter section ready. - Dropping recon jet for target survey. Space ship to Williams. Move to within 4 Zs of target. This is Williams to space ship. - Trouble with flight. - Calm down and set automatic. - What's going on? - Controls are all off. The radar has gone wild. There's some strange force, but I can't see a thing. It's moving in. It's moving in. It's closing. I feel it. It's closer. Lord, it's coming in. Retro rockets, all shift quick. Cut retros. - What was that? - That's what I'd like to know. - What happened down there? - I don't know Sir. - Where the instruments on monitor relay - Of course Sir. It didn't make sense. For a few seconds every circuit on that ship went crazy. They must have some weapons version of that force field of theirs. I should have figured that one myself. They've got an energy shield around that moon no ship can penetrate. We're still in range for a rocket salvo. Even if only a couple of those warheads get through. No good. Same problem. The instrumentation in those rocket pods is shielded from any possibility - of enemy control. - But so were the control circuits. - In the scout. - Exactly. You saw what happened. If we fired rockets at those snow devils they'd disintegrate just like that. Or worse. Bounce back and detonate right in our laps. Look out! They're coming right at us. Engine! Solid body devoid of electronic circuit can pass through. That's the way to hit them. I wish IO knew what Jackson was up to. I wish we could help him. He's probably trying to break through that protective force field. But... he's only wasting his time. But it could be done of course, given the equipment and the time in the proton force area. Assuming it is a proton situation. - It could be neutralised... - Don't lecture me on nuclear physics. Sorry General. I thought. - Sorry Doctor. - Quite alright General. - I... - General, look... - They're retreating. - He's pulling back. I'm afraid we've had it gentlemen. I respect the Commander's decision. Apparently he feels it would be mass suicide to force through that field surrounding Callisto. He's changing course again. I don't have the charts of that quadrant. But aren't they heading now for the asteroid belt? By George, I believe that's just what they're doing. For the asteroids? Why? I don't know. By the time we send a signal there and back, he'll have made his next move. There's noting to do but wait and see. - Ready to go with the plan? - Whenever you give the word. Fine. Maintain communications silence at this point. Cut rear rockets Frank. - Rear rockets off. - OK it?s time Frank. Have Wilkinson take over controls. OK Willie, cut communications. Switching off Commander. Tell all commanders to regulate those magnetic fields real well. Otherwise we'll have the whole works piling up on our exhaust stacks. - Is that it? - Let me know when the cables are active Power cables in place Sir. What about our generated flux density? We'll have plenty to spare. That's it. Let's go. Engines. Engines! They're full thrust Sir. Stand by generators. Generators are go. Activate. Generators functioning Sir. It worked, we did it. Navigator, set course for Callisto. We've got a good chance now Frank. But remember... This ball game isn't over yet. So, that's what he had in mind. He picked up those ferrous asteroids just like iron filings. It's dangerous, but it might work. Stand by to cut power off. Now! Look, it must have exploded their main reactors. Rod we did it. We got through. We stopped them. Now you can send the general a report on the mission. And Frank... Tell them we're coming home. General Norton has sent you more than just a commendation. - As things stand, you're on leave. - That's great. And I've found your itinerary today. First off, we'll go to the beach. And we'll partake of an already prepared old fashioned picnic lunch. We're back to normal. It's going to rain. Oh no!
