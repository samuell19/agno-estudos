This double six, is worth 10 thousand rupees. Here you are. And this double nine ... ... is worth 30 thousand rupees... ... to see. The devil is on your side! Another game? Sure, for a rematch. Is it really necessary? I don't play twice, with the same deck of cards. I don't like new cards. They're so unpleasant. You didn't do it on purpose, right? - You know you've risked your life? - Yeah, you too. For a dancer? Let's say... for a principle. -Shall we continue? - I was going to propose that. Enough. I'm going to sleep. A good game, exciting, you haven't had any luck, Alan. And to think that I have taught yourself this game, to screw you. Here's the account of the tokens, sahib, if you want to check. Okay... I trust you. Take him to bed and tomorrow execute the orders. Yes, your Highness. Good night. HUMMING. Sahib! Sahib! Whoever you are, go to hell and let me sleep! What the hell... I'm sorry sahib, but it is something very urgent. His Highness wants you to pay the debt of the game. Now? The debt of the game? What trick is this? It is His Highness wish and therefore... ... can not be discussed, or postponed. And neither my sleep. There is the coat, take what you want and let me sleep. You again? What else do you want? Didn't you take the money? - Yes, sahib, exactly 130 rupees. - So what? Making a rough calculation, which is an approximation... ... it's missing a million rupees... or rather, $ 250,000 USD. What? One million rupees? Are you kidding? No, sahib. You can check all the papers signed. No... tell your boss that's all the money I have. If it is enough, fine, otherwise... Otherwise, I can not help. His Highness expected this. Sahib. What does this mean? A gift from His Highness, the last. You mean... A broke gentleman with no choice to save the honor. I have no intention to save my honor. His Highness also expected this, urging me... ... not to allow sahib, for the sake of hospitality... ... to destroy your reputation. A suicide? Not sahib, an unpleasant duty. Where is Sirdar, I want to talk to him immediately. His Highness is in the garden but has nothing to tell you. GESTURE OF DECEPTION Go to hell! Sirdar! Sirdar! Don't shout like that, Alan, you scare my little friends. Do not shout? I was drawn into a trap and threatened with death... ... by that band of murderers! I have the right to ask the payment of your debt, no? I thought we were friends. But I am your friend, Alan. Forgive me, if you had won, wouldn't you have asked the money? - Sure. - And why should I not do the same? But can't you... ... be happy with 130 rupees? Don't play with me, Alan! To forget your debt, you should give me at least... The Mountain Of Light. The Mountain Of Light? What is it? Don't tell me you don't know what is, The Mountain of Light. Never heard. Alan, I know you ran away from America and are wanted... ... in connection to the robbery of the Central Bank of New York. You know that I'm innocent, otherwise, wouldn't allow a thief in the palace. Will you pay off your debt? Give me 24 hours. Of course. What a shame... your greed has destroyed our friendship. I'll send a telegram to my banker in New Delhi... ... to deposit in your account, your dirty money. Very well. I count on your punctuality. We rely on your punctuality. Oh, it's you, little rascal. Come here if you don't want to get a spanking. - Peace? - Peace, come down. - One rupee, sahib. - I have nothing. One rupee. I told you no. Half. Not a damn. You do not believe, but I'm broke. You're lying. The white sahib are very rich. Unfortunately not all. - What kind of place is this? - That is Shakti. - Do you live there? - No, I am the son of everybody. I am a great sorcerer. - You? Yes. INDISTINCT SPEAKING WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC INDISTINCT SPEAKING WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC Hey! He is a very holy man. He's praying. He speaks directly to the gods. Sometimes he stays like that throughout the whole day. Why do you disturb my meditations? It is a Sahib, master. White man. Liar, non-believer, impure. Sorry if I meddled between you and the gods. Why, you have doubts? A charlatan like you, can fool the Indians, but not me. Are you challenging me? Watch this. Climb up, little friend. Are you convinced, sahib? It's a trick. I'll show you something harder, watch. I'll stick this nail in the neck... ... and make it out on the other side. Just a little mistake ... ... and I die. I will do it if you give me a 1000 rupees. It would be fun, but I have none. What does a white man in India, with no money? The same as you, tries to make money. Who has a gun is not poor. The gun is the last thing that is sold. I could pay you a fortune. Why do you want a gun? The good road, sometimes is full of dangers. How much would you pay? Are you hungry... like me, sahib,... ... come, with a full belly we'll discuss better? Magnificent gun, sahib. Never seen anything like it in all India. How many shots can be fired without loading? Has a bullet in the chamber and six in the charger. I want it, sahib. How much do you want? 10,000 rupees. It's a lot for a poor fakir. Too bad. 5000 rupees, sahib... ... is not enough? - No. You're smart. So be it. I'll give you the 10,000 rupees. How do you have so much money, charlatan? Did I ask why you have so little? Good answer, Sitama. But no tricks. Sahib, how can you doubt a man of God? Stop, man of God! Bravo Sitama, you're also fisherman. I didn't think you had such a light sleep. Blame it on the bugs, they are very hungry. They're pesky critters. Let's bet the gun against your 10,000 rupees? My religion forbids gambling. Too bad. It was the way to get the gun without spending a penny. I could make an exception to the rule. The gods, when the cause is good, sometimes can be... ... very understanding. Do you know how to play poker? A bit. One try. My gun... ... against your rupees. One card, sahib... A sip of arak? - After. SNEEZING One. I'm lucky, sahib. A poker of aces. It was a good game, sahib. Leave the gun. But I won, sahib. - With my cards! Sahib, I protest, it was a clean game. So clean, as to shoot in your legs. What a crook, and I thought that you were brave. Oh, sahib... ... I'm very brave, certainly you can't compete with me. But I appreciated your technique. Really great for a white man. Hey. Goodbye, sahib. It was a pleasure to see you. What do you want? Sahib, you must pay your bill and the fakir's... ... it is 13 rupees and a half. - Can you run? - Why, sahib? Because if you want to be paid, you'll have to run after the fakir. Not a penny I have. You have already eaten and slept, now you must pay 13 rupees and a half. Take your hands off me! You have to pay! Get the thief. Help! CRIES OF TERROR Sahib... here. Where are you going, sahib? I'll cross the border and go to Calcutta. And you? I'm going to Kisna for the Tirunal festivities... ... on these days there's always some good deals. Are they looking for you, Sahib? Maybe. You're a dangerous friend, what have you done? A difference of opinion... ... with Rajah. What is the Mountain of Light? The Mountain of Light? Yes, you know something about it? I know someone in Calcutta, willing to pay 4 million rupees... ... for that diamond. A million dollars. It is a diamond of 200 carats... ... big as a walnut and bluish hues. For that stone, more blood, has already been spilled... ... than the revolt of the "Sepoy". I begin to see. - Who does it belongs to? - Everyone and no one... ... it is stuck in the forehead of the statue of the God Darmaraja... ... in the Kisna Temple. And no one ever thought of... Sahib, soldiers guard it day and night... ... and no Indian dares to touch it. It is a sacred stone, they say to be the bearer of doom. Do you believe? 4 million rupees, are an amulet against any calamity. I'll go with you to Kisna. I want to take a look. Sahib, no white can enter the Temple. Can you disguise myself as a pilgrim? It will not be difficult... ... but do not be fooled, even God Darmaraja in person... ... wouldn't dare steal, The Mountain of Light. Have you heard of the theft to the Bank of New York? Well, I am the author. Let's go to Kisna, fakir. After you, I go. Look sahib, that is the Temple. It is impossible sahib, see? Is the temple, always open? Day and night but the surveillance is continuous. There must be a way. We can not waive a million dollars. 3 HITS ON THE GONG Darmaraja! Hey, who is it? The great orator of the temple... ... a very important man. - And if we offer him $ 1000... - Sahib! - What is going on? -It's the sacrifice in honor of the God. - This ritual, is always at the same time? - At noon and midnight. It can be helpful? Especially for you. I'd throw you in the tank, to divert attention. No sahib, I can't stand that water. I have to find out... My religion only allows one bath a year... ... in the waters of the Ganges. - Can't you make an exception? I don't see the reason. But I do! Sahib, for two days you have been watching the dome... ... renounce to your feat. Shut up and let me think... ... there is nothing that can't be stolen. Or should I believe that the great orator is smarter than me. ... which is impossible. How long was this temple built? Has existed ever since there's India, nobody knows. - Do you know Michelangelo? - No, sahib. He lived many years ago and built larger domes. He studied at the University of Michigan. - Bang! - Sahib, are you crazy? No, but I'm the biggest idiot who attended architecture. Your orator, doesn't seem to know how a dome is built. What do you mean, I don't understand, can you explain. The Mountain of Light is ours! Sahib! Can you get a 30 meters silk black rope... ... as thin as a little finger, that can hold my weight? This is easy. Something that makes people falling asleep within a 5 meter radius? Sleeping powder! A stick of dynamite with a fuse of a minute? And a pulley with a hook? Rope, sleeping powder, dynamite, pulley. I can't see the connection. Get all these and don't think of anything else. I promise you that we'll get The Mountain of Light. Light up the lantern. Where are we, sahib? Let's see... this should be the drum of the dome. Here should be the entry to the vault. There it is! Penknife! Oil! It is moving. Haven't I told you I opened the safe of the New York Bank? Over and over! Stay away, your smell doesn't let me concentrate. The dome. -Look, sahib! - The staircase is destroyed. I expected. - What do we do? - Give me the map. Watch out! Go away, dammit! You're also a mouse entertainer? No Sahib, it's just they don't like music. See how they fled? And you call this music? Crazy fakir. I would also flee, and I'm not a mouse, either. - Quickly, sahib! - Yes. Hold it... - Climb up! Hold it! What are you doing? You fool! - Come on, you can do it. - Do not worry, go ahead. Here... give me the penknife! Quickly. Look. Sahib... you are the best. - Give me the rope. - Yes. - The pulley. - Here. You'll stay here until the evening. - With the rats? You'll pass the rope through the pulley... ... and in the end we'll make a loop to put the foot... ... and with the lever, lift the cover and remove it. Watch out, when you hear the gong announcing the arrival of the orator... ... you turn the lantern like this... ... at that time, no one will think of looking up. Then you'll pass me the rope... ... and when you feel a jolt, begin to pull hard. Now begin to see! I put the Mountain of Light in the pocket! There are 30 meters of rope, you have 10 seconds to pull me up. Look, if you delay only one second... ... I swear I'll take your skin off! I promise sahib... ... it will appear that you'll be taken up by the hand of the angels... ... to heaven! 3 BLOWS IN GONG Look! Quickly, get him! - What did you do? - Sorry Sahib, but the hand... Hurry up! Quickly, before they close the gate. No sahib, can not leave like that. You moron. We are lost. Take this, it's easier for me to go unnoticed. - Sirdar, we are stuck. - What do we do? Lock all exits! Nobody leaves the temple! Behind the statue, if we get there without being seen! I can not swim, sahib! It's a good time for you to wash yourself. Stolen, sir! Stolen! Climb! Climb, come on! - And if they come here, Sahib? - Shut up, moron! We have to inspect all possible hiding places. The pride of India. The Mountain of Light, ought to be recovered. You have to find it, orator! Please, sir, only you can help me... ... to get back the eye of God... ... or Darmaraja will not hide his anger... ... and will launch serious disasters on our people. Water will dry up, corn will turn into weeds. - Women will not give birth... - I know the prophecy. What does Sirdar here? When you're dead sahib, does it matter who killed you? What a genius. What did you say, sir? I said that the thief is a true evil genius. But don't worry, orator... ... there will be no peace until the eye of God is back in our hands. I'll set up a manhunt network... ... and he will pay for his audacity. - Thank you, sir. Darmaraja will reward you... ... and you'll go down in history as Sirdar, the generous, the tireless. I can not, sahib. Hang on, they are leaving. You can go, orator. INDISTINCT TALKING WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC Sahib, we will be discovered, we have to leave too. We better get ou quickly. Where are you going? I am Sitama, the fakir of Shakti... ... everyone knows me. I am innocent, I swear. Just a moment. Great Maharaja, I am innocent. - Why is your hand wrapped? - The bomb, was the bomb. I was next to the tank to pray and the bomb exploded. I have an injured hand, and need treatment or I die. I have lost a lot of blood. The Mountain of Light could be hidden there. Search him, unwrap his hand. Not Maharaja. GROANING WITH PAIN Done, sir. Let him go. You, come here. Who are you? Answer me. Speak! Say your name, speak up, if you don't want... Forgive him, Sir, he does not speak, is a holy man... ... he promised not to talk for life... ... to achieve perfection. Speak up, I want to hear your voice, with or without promises. Speak up, or I cut your throat. No. He's stubborn. He would die just not to break the promise. He would even sacrifice his life. Speak. Speak up! I will tell you what you want to know, great Maharaja. He can not answer you. Respect his faith. This man is pure. Let him go. Sahib, can't go anymore. Run, we will have time to rest. SCREAMING Help... Help, sahib. Where are you? I am here, sahib! What an idiot! Get me out of here, fast. What are you waiting for, sahib. The soldiers will follow our tracks. Help me! ROAR ROAR ROAR ROAR Now get me out. You are a fakir, show me your power. Use your rope. Do not play sahib, the tiger may return. You're not very appetizing. So goodbye, Sitama, and thank you for your collaboration. And the Mountain of Light? I'm taking it to Calcutta, we'll meet in a week... ... and divide the 4 million. Sahib! Good luck. We will see in Calcutta. Goodbye. Sahib! Sitama! Give me one rupee, sahib. - Please, one rupee. - I have nothing. I will pray for you. For me too. For me too, in the name of Darmaraja. ORIENTAL MUSIC ORIENTAL MUSIC ORIENTAL MUSIC ORIENTAL MUSIC ORIENTAL MUSIC SCREAMING Be quiet. You won't scream? Hide me, they want to kill me. Please. Get in, quickly. - What is happening? - Go away! What happened? - No, Sitama. - There. Who are you? What do you want here? Speak. Have you seen a white man? You know no whithe man ever comes here. That man stole, The Mountain of Light... ... he's filthy. If you protect him, the demons will tear off your flesh. - Speak! - I swear. No white man came in here. For Shiva, he has escaped. Let's search all the roads very carefully... ... but we have to get him. Come out sahib, you are safe. Thank you. What is your name? Lilamani. Lilamani, I owe you my life. You faced great danger for me. Those rascals would not have hesitated a moment. I will reward you. I don't want anything, sahib. So... why did you do it? Don't you recognize me, sahib? No, never seen you. You have seen me, sahib. One day, while dancing in the Royal Palace... ... the Rajah whipped me and you saved me from his wrath. You also took a risk for me, for goodness. The fable of Androcles and the Lion. Alright. I don't understand. Doesn't matter. Whta are you going to do now? I don't know. With that rascal Sitama out there. It is true that you stole, The Mountain of Light? Yes. You hate me for this? Why did you stole it, are you a thief? It is a very valuable stone, it can bring wealth. Darmaraja is a very powerful god... ... and will punish the man who stole the diamond. And will punish me too for helping you. Are you going to report me? I won't keep any resentment against you. Give back the Mountain of Light, sahib. You won't be happy if you don't do it. Darmaraja is just a statue. If it was a true god, It wouldn't have allowed me to steal it. The gods are patients. My God is more powerful that your Darmaraja... ... He will protect me. Your God is a friend of thieves? Well, no... but steal a statue, is not stealing. I did not hurt anyone. Your action has offended an entire people. Where are you going? If I can't stay here... - They will kill you? - I'm afraid of you. Stay sahib, I'll help you. God Darmaraja will forgive me. - And then? - Nothing, seems he has evaporated. We searched houses, sewers, cellars. You're saying a white man is smarter than a fakir? You saw how he stole The Mountain of Light? Surely, he's going to get out of town. We will wait for him at the gate. They are all aware, I promised a 1000 rupees to whoever deliver him. Do you think it will be better? A dancer performs always with a servant... ... giving somersaults to the music. - No one will suspect you. - You're an angel, Lilamani... You speak in a funny way, sahib. The Mountain of Light. Lilamani? Give me your belt. - What? - The belt. What will you do? You'll see. - Put it again. - They'll find it. We'll see! It is so simple that no one will ever remember to look there. Now, let's try. Buy merit for the Holy Trimurti. Thank you, dear maiden, Darmaraja will reward you. Let's go. We have to cross the border. Is it far from here? Two days' march, but by stone mountains. We can never pass, without a guide. We will. Come. Unbelievable. In a small town of 10 000 people... ... a white man, easily recognizable... ... can't be found. It's ridiculous! Sitama! Nothing for now, but he's hidding here, it takes patience... ... and wait until he leaves his hiding place. No one left the city, except the dancer and her servant. The Mountain of Light will be yours. What did you say? No one left, except... The dancer and her servant. Idiot, the dancer had no servant... ... it was the American. Passed under your nose without you realizing! Here is Satras, the border is there. I think we can rest. Let's go. Give us a coconut, please. Drink. SHOOTING SHOOTING SHOOTING SHOOTING SHOOTING Sitama. How do you know? I recognize the sound of my gun. Where was it? I had it hidden among the clothes. What do we do now? If I had known... - Sahib! - What do you want, old crow? - Go away or I'll kill you. - Drop the gun. Give me the Mountain of Light, and I'll let you cross the border. Come get it. I'll wait for you! Do not play, sahib. I'll set fire to the house and you'll burn like torches. The Mountain of Light is not afraid of fire... ... and I'll find it, wherever you have it hidden. That filthy fakir... Sitama! Sitama! Decided to surrender? You are a very wise man. I don't have the Mountain of Light, it is hidden. If you kill me, you'll never find it. Enough talking, surrender, or you will be scorched. There is a woman with me. She has nothing to do with it. Let her go, and then we'll take care of our business. Very well, sahib. Let her come out with her hands up, and no tricks. Go, cross the border and wait for me in the first town. I'll find some way to escape and we will join later. No Alan, don't send me away. Go away, while there is time. Sitama may change his mind. No, I'll stay with you. Don't worry about me, flee and save the Mountain of Light. But they will kill you, I can not leave you alone. Too late. Let's go out by the window. Fast. Maybe there is someone inside, bring water, quickly. Hurry up! It's over now. Sergeant, it is true, there is someone inside. Come out. Why didn't you leave quickly? Who are you? What is going on here? Sir, we were passing through the village... ... when bandits attacked to rob us. Follow me to the station, for official questioning. Let's go. Come, they'll escort us and take us to the border. HOWL OF ANIMAL Coyotes. PAIN CRYING. Quickly, get a cover! Do not shoot! Get him alive. I want him alive, with the maiden. Let me go. Alan, Alan. Help, help, Alan! Come on, come on! Move! He escaped that way, Sitama. Let's go. I'm fine. Where is the Mountain of Light? I don't know what you're talking, fakir. You know what is the punishment in your next life... ... if you become an accomplice to crime against God Darmaraja? You'll reborn in the form of a filthy cockroach... ... and then... like a bat. And like that, for seven generations. Tell me where is the Mountain of Light and you will be purified. The Orator will bless you. I don't know. The white man paid me to help him escape. - I know nothing. - No, maiden. You fell in love with the white man... ... but the white man does not care about you. Have you seen how he escaped? You mean nothing to him. I know nothing. Where is the Mountain of Light? - I don't know. - Speak, stupid! I know nothing! Sitama! Leave her alone, or I smash your head like a pumpkin. We were waiting for you, sahib. No Alan, save yourself. They didn't get anything from me. He won't save himself. White men are fools, they have a weak heart. Didn't we agree to meet in Calcutta? We can meet at any time... ... but I would rather prefer to have the diamond in my hands... ... I would feel safer. Are you in trouble, fakir, if you kill me, you lose the diamond... ... only I know where he is. No sahib, the maiden also know. You're wrong, sahib... ... a secret told to a woman, is no longer a secret. Yeah... you're right. No more wasting time, where is the Mountain of Light? Wait, who tells me that after you have it, you won't kill me? I give you my word, sahib. Your word... That's the funniest joke I've ever heard. And my word would you trust, Alan? Sirdar! What are you doing here? I'm here to collect my debt. I said I would just forget the debt... ... in exchange for the Mountain of Light. As you can see, our commitment was only postponed. Now it is the time to settle our business. So, all of this was a plan. Of course. I knew you were the only man in the world... ... capable of removing from the God's forehead, the Mountain of Light. And I encouraged you to do so. I allowed you to escape from the palace... ... and put on your heels my faithful Sitama. I mugged you off. You thought it was for you but instead, was for me... ... you stole the diamond. But you're Maharaja. Why you want the Mountain of Light? I want it! I don't get it. You will have to keep it hidden... ... the people will revolt, if they know you have it. I just have to have it. Be able to touch it, keep it. To know that it is mine. No one understands the deep fascination... ... of its pure white light. That's why, you were in the temple? Certainly. Otherwise, you never would have made it out, with the diamond. As you see, I also took part in the theft. So, I want my share. Your share. Adding the game's debt to your life... ... and the Maiden's, you'll see that it gets even. Yes, but you should add the passport... ... and also money, for Lilamani. I agree, word of Rajah. The belt. Do you have a knife? Here it is, your diamond. You were with me. Check it. Royal Highness it is the Mountain of Light. Finally it is mine. Goodbye. Sirdar. Now we're even. Alan, my friend... ... there is a small detail. That is? You see Alan, the problem is... ... you know too much. And to keep this stone... ... I need obsolut secret. I 'll say nothing, I'll tell a story where I'll play dumb. I know you're sincere, but human nature... ... is so unstable, so inconsistent. If there was a way to avoid killing you... ... I would be happy, but I must listen to my generous spirit. And your word? Prevails the reason of the moment. So, how do we do? As a sign of my special grace... ... I let you choose how to die. Do you prefer water or fire? I am very grateful. - Do you know how to swim? - A little. Then, water. Sitama! Sitama! Lilamani, I dragged you to an adventure without hope. Why did you come back? I never would have revealed the hiding place of the diamond... ... and if they have killed me, you would have found it in my body. I thought about it, and I confess I was to run away... ...but I realized you were more important than the Mountanha of Light. - I love you Lilamani. - I love you too, Alan... ... and I'm not afraid to die. I had in my life... ... more than I dared to expect. It was my first good deed, and never thought I would loose my life! Now, here we are... - Alan? - Yes. In case we save ourselves, promise me you'll do anything... ... to put back the Mountain of Light, in the God's forehead. It's useless to fool ourselves... ... it's over now. Swear to me and I'll die happy... ... knowing that the God forgives me. I swear, Lilamani, if we survive... ... I will tear off... ... the diamond from Sirdar, and put it up in the God's forehead! What's going on in your head, why don't you come? The path to Kisna is that and you will return there. What am I going to do to Kisna? Put the Mountain of Light in place. - You promised. - Beautiful promise! Made because you deceived me! Why didn't you tell me that with the knife robbed to Sirdar... ... you cut the ropes. You're being flippant. That's a promise I'm not required to keep. I do this for your own good! For my own good? Do you want to explain yourself? That diamond brings misfortune to who owns it. You'll never be happy if you don't return it to the God. With a million dollars, I will be very happy. Listen to me... ... I love you, and want to live with you, marry you. With that diamond we can have a dream life... ... I can take you to the United States, to London, to Paris. Here you're just a humble dancer... ... there, you'll be a lady. For the last time, do you want to come with me? If you don't return the diamond, no! Then, stay in this poor and miserable country! I congratulate you. And then... what is a diamond? A piece of glass, a little more refined. It has no value in the forehead of that ridiculous statue. Darmaraja saved your life for the promise you made! Darmaraja! If you hadn't stolen the dagger, we would have drowned like the rats! Darmaraja will revenge, your life will be full of misfortunes... ... you'll die if you don't return the diamond. This is superstition, I don't believe. Come with me, I will make you happy, you'll see. A man who forgets his promises easily... ... is not able to do better. Very well, let's do this stupidity... ... after, don't make a hell out of my life. I wasn't wrong... ... you're a good soul. Let's go! The Mountain of Light... ... torn off from the God's forehead, by a thief without scruples... ... is returned today... ... thanks to the courage of this white man... ... and perseverance of our great Rajah... ... the noble Sirdar... ... that will have forever, the gratitude of the people. Foreigner... ... you have done a great service to the people of India... ... to whom you will have avoided disasters and calamities. The faithful of Darmaraja, gathered here... ... want to offer you a sign of gratitude. Proceed with the ceremony. For special services provided to the country... ... I name you a noble of the Order of Darmaraja. It is the sacred stone. I ask the privilege of putting it, myself, on the God's forehead. This is a honor due to the hero. Why did you return it, dammit? You know how women are, Highness... - Are you happy? - Of Cource. Now Darmaraja will be generous with us. Yes, but not Sirdar, let's go before he gets revenge. Ah, just a moment... I hope the God doesn't hold a grudge against me... ... if upon his forehead shines an imitation. If, however, the Mountain of Light brings bad luck... ... it's not my problem. I agreed to the sale, with the Viceroy from India... ... who wanted to give it away to Queen Victoria. Anyway... it will be seen by their real successors. And in the English crown... ... the Mountain of Light found his eternal rest. Today, it adorns the head of this beautiful lady.
