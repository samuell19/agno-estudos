I am the great detective I take advice from none I?ll even find a pimple On a giant elephant I do fight like a lion I do work like a bee My dog-like nose sniffs so fine My eagle-eye can see. My iron hand is dreadful You?ll tremble and you?ll flee And it?s completely futile To hide away from me More agile than a monkey More mighty than a whale My dog-like nose knows something My eagle-eye can?t fail. I?ve been to many places I?m up to any task Soon all your pretty faces Are gonna be unmasked I vanish in the twilight I dive and swim so deep My dog-like nose stands upright My eagle-eye can peep These days children are so selfish There?s no way to keep them docile We spend all our nerves on them But they spit on it in return Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad! Oh, she is so naughty?she so upset her dad! These days children are demanding But they can?t be repremanded They want song and dance till dawn From parents they got too withdrawn Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad! Oh, sheis so naughty?she so upset her dad! Children are indeed our penance They?re a misbehaving menace Since we bought them costly tutors Still, without them life is stupor Oh, she is so naughty, she ran from palace mad! Oh, sheis so naughty?she so upset her dad! Sun?s ray so pure and golden Clouds trapped behind their shroud And now this wall has stolen That union we?d avowed Night will pass, come morning bright and clear Trust that happiness awaits us Night will pass, will pass these times of fear The sun shall then rise The sun shall then rise Birds ceased their song till morning Stars touch our roofs with light Through whirlwinds of our mourning Do hear my voice tonight Night will pass, come morning bright and clear Trust that happiness awaits us Night will pass, will pass these times of fear The sun shall then rise The sun shall then rise Why, you are my little poor troubadummy child How your figure has thinned out after all this while Rest in comfort of your father and king --I d o n o t w a n t a n y t h i n g! Your hysterical condition is dangerous Have a dietetic egg to encourage us Maybe doctors can prescribe you a pill? --T h i s i s q u i t e a g a i n s t m y w i l l! Why, my princess drowned in sorrowful fantasies Soon we?ll have ourselves musicians from overseas Choose among them whom your heart may desire --I d o n o t w a n t a n y, S i r e! Perhaps we have no household of our own But we don?t pay a dime to tax collectors We?re laborers of knife as well as axe Romantics always living on the road We don?t want to live any other way We don?t want to live any other way We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge We walk on our precious edge We roam around from morning until dawn Somebody else?s boots give our feet blisters We?re laborers of knife as well as axe Romantics living freely on the road We don?t want to live any other way We don?t want to live any other way We walk on the edge, we walk on the edge We walk on our precious edge Our feet are licked by tongues of fire all night Why don?t these touchy-feely people love us Us laborers of knife as well as axe, Romantics living freely on the road We don't want to live any other way... We are walking on edge... The whole world?s in our hands We?re stars so well-reputed And we will pulverize Competitors and suitors We came to you just for a bit Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello Now fall in love with us and quick You?re in great luck, you know! And now, my dears Lend me your ears And perhaps you?d better Clap for us together When we begin to sing All eyes with joy do weep And we already know That things are meant to be We came to you just for a bit Privyet, Bon Jour, Hello Now fall in love with us and quick You?re in great luck, you know! And now, my dears Lend me your ears And perhaps you?d better Clap for us together Rocka, rocka, rocka bye Don?t sleep on the edge, good night On the edge I always sleep And no bad dreams ever creep Rocka, rocka, rocka bye Don?t sleep on the edge, good night I can?t sleep next to the wall My knees press 'cause I?m so tall Think on edge I?ll lie Don?t lie there! Gonna sleep so nice Don?t lie there! Gonna make you cry Don?t lie there, don?t lie there! A grey wolf will come at night And will take of you a bite THE END
