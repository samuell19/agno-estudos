And I always loved that dress. - Well, I didn't know that guy anywhere. What? Geez. - Uncle Bill. - What, what... - What're you doin' here? - Well I, I came here to talk about your dad. You know, I'm on your side and he went, what? - Okay, okay. I, I, that's great, but why don't we talk about it outside? - No more secrets, all right? I wanna tell you about your Grandpa Joe. Boy, could he play a great trumpet. Oh, what a horn. Yeah, he could've been a big, big star. I'll tell you how big he could've been. Ray Noble, the big band leader, he's the guy that offered him, well, top trumpeter, you know, to come out on gigs all over the United States. And then your grandma, well, she shut the door on him. No, she said, "Joe, come home." He came home. Yeah, played places like the Kiwanis and (chuckles). - You know, Dad never told me any of that stuff. He just said that, that Grandpa Joe, you know, fooled around in his spare time. - Well, you remind me a lot of Joe, as a matter of fact. Except for his drinking. He drank a lot. And you know the reason probably yourself. A lot of people drink 'cause they're unhappy. Sad. - Hey uh, Uncle Bill? - Mm? - I wanna say uh, I wanna say thank you. You know, thanks for being you, and tell you that I love you. - Well, I love you. (mellow guitar music) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. - Okay. And what do we have here? - I'm practicing my swing moves. - The dance known as swing, as I recall, requires a partner, last time I checked. - You arrived just in time. Come on. - No, no, no, no. - Anthony, Anthony. - Yes, yes, yes. - Anthony, I do not do the guy-girl thing, even with my handsome roommate. And especially not swing. My style is slow, breast to breast. - Come on, Martha, that's ridiculous. - No, I'm not interested. - I won't tell any of your girlfriends. (Martha scoffs) Just humor me a little bit. - No. - (snaps) I'll clean the bathroom. - No fair. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - No, I'm leading. - No. - You got, yes. You're up top. You ready? - One time, you lead. - I'm leading this dance, baby. - All right. - Okay now, you're gonna start on your right, I start on my left. - Okay then. - Just, just follow me. Just, just watch me, okay? - Okay, all right. Yeah. - One, two, dah, dah, rock back. - Okay, back. - Dah, dah, dah. You ready for the big move? - What's the big move? - It's the dip. - Oh my god, no! (Anthony groans) (fingers tapping) - Hi. - Hey, I was just about to call you. - I miss you. - I miss you too. Hey, you know what? I wrote a new song. I can't wait to play it for you. - Well um, I have class tonight. Maybe over the weekend? - Uh, no problem. You can uh, you can hear it at the gig Friday night. - (sighs) Anthony, I, I have another call coming. I gotta go, bye. (computer keys clacking) - You know, my harpist friend from Julliard told me that her guru said that it's really good karma to do menial tasks. It, it, it helps keep the creative process flowing. You know, like, write a song, clean the bathroom. (audience cheering) (swing music) (audience cheering) - What a lovely surprise. Oh, do you remember Freddie? - Of course. How you doing? - Mm, it's so great dancing with this woman. (Freddie and Christine laugh) - Christine, I was hoping that we could... - Oh, well if you wanted to dance, I'm afraid I'm all tapped out, but we could sit and talk for a while. - That would be great. - Freddie. - Mm-hmm? - Thank you. It was wonderful. - No, thank you. Till next time? - It'll seem like an eternity. - This uh, this may sound crazy and all, but I uh, I wrote a song for you. You inspire me. (Christine chuckles) You're my angel. - Yes I am. (Christine laughs) I'm moved beyond words. No one's ever written a song for me. Ah. I have something for you. (Anthony sighs) It looks like an ordinary stone, doesn't it? Inside, it's a diamond. Rare, valuable, beautiful, like you. You just have to believe. Do you believe? - Yeah, I believe. Thank you. - And now we have a wonderful tune for you. "Alexander's Ragtime Band," featuring our trumpet player, Joe. Come on out, Joe. (audience applauding) (swing music) (audience applauding) - Ah, I still got it, huh, Freddie? - You're smoking tonight, Joe. You know, I ran into this young cat named Miles. He wanted me to show you something, hm? - Don't hurt yourself, Freddie. (trumpet sputtering) - I'm just the messenger. - You're ready to swing on your own. - But I wanna keep dancing with you. Can we go somewhere else and dance? I know some salsa. I'll, I'll teach you salsa. - Yeah? - Yeah. Or uh, you haven't even heard me play yet. You have to come to one of my gigs. You'll love it. - Anthony, it's been a pleasure. And as I see it, pleasure's number one. (Anthony chuckles nervously) - Well, if it's been such a pleasure then, why stop? - It's time. One day you'll understand. Swing is a metaphor for life. It requires skill and coordination, practice, and passion. - Passion. I got the passion. - Forget about dancing with me. You have important things to get on with out there. - But, (sighs) don't you feel this too? You must. I think I'm falling in love. (snare drum music) - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time, once again, for the Club Jimbo dance contest. (audience applauding) (swing music) - [Crowd] Whoo! (swing music) (distant electric guitar music) - [Christine] It's a gift, be grateful for it. - [Tina] You don't know what you're missing. - Hi. - Thanks for being you. - [George] Security, security. You understand security? - [Christine] You have important things to get on with out there. - We're all visitors. So don't blow the visit. - [Valerie] All this energy needs to be put into your life, and getting it together. - [Christine] One day you'll understand. - [Doorman] Arrivederci. (wind whipping) (slow haunting music) (Anthony muttering quietly) - This is it. "Live swing, from San Francisco's Famous Club Jimbo." Oh man. - Well, I finally got a decent hand. Okay, you remember deuces wild. There's four threes, right there. - Deuces wild? We're not playing poker. - I thought we were. - No, we weren't playing poker... - Are you gonna change it again? You know, every time we, we sit down to play cards, you have to change it, and you don't remember... - We're not, we, we didn't start out that way. - Wait a minute, dear. - What do you wanna play? - Wait a minute, dear. You know, you've had a little power failure up here. - Yeah well... - And, the electricity... - There's a lot of that going around. - Tell me, and you've got a lot of it. - Yeah, well, you've got more. - A lot of elect, well, a lot of electricity has been turned off. - Yeah, but I'm not, we're playing rummy, and you're playing poker, so... - All right, all right, all right. - Who's powerless now? - Give me your cards. - Hi, Mrs. Wall, Uncle Bill. - Hi, how are ya? - Hello, dear. - I'm all right. - You, you, you look so pretty, but, fix your tie. - Oh, yeah it's... Uh, Uncle Bill, I gotta ask ya a quick question. Um, this record here, I got this out of uh, that box Mrs. DeLuca gave you. - Mm-hmm. - Is this the same Club Jimbo you remember? - Hm, sure is. "Live Swing, from San Francisco's Famous Club Jimbo." Dear, would you give me the glass over there? - Sure. - I wanna take a look at the back here. No dear, not, not that glass. Take that back. Give me the magnifying glass. All right, let me see here. Oh, look here. Here's Christine down here. - Right there? - Yep. And here, here I am, right there. And there's your Grandpa Joe. (chuckles) - That's, that's Grandpa Joe? - Boy, look how clean we looked. You know, we were all so doggone young. You wanna play some cards? - Uh, no, no, Uncle Bill, I'm not gonna play cards today. - That's all right, we could sure a, a third, but... - Okay, it's your turn. - What is it my turn again? - Yeah. Do something. (waves crashing) - Do you believe in angels? - Yes. - Just like that? - You know me. I need to believe that there is something or someone out there who believes in me. Do you? - I do now. Hey Pam, you, you can get outta here. I'm gonna take over. - Oh, thank you, Anthony. - Sure. - My poor husband's been watching the kids all day. He's exhausted. But I uh, I thought you had a gig tonight? - I do. I wonder what's keeping Tom so long. - Oh uh, Tom's not coming back till tomorrow. - What do you mean? - Okay. - Oh man, not till tomorrow. Oh, Sal, do I need your help right now. - Ah, Anthony. I got a date tonight. You'll be all right. - Another date? - Young man, I am in a hurry.

You make a mess, you walk out on a store full of customers. - Stop. - I spent a lotta years, a lotta hard labor building up a reputation for quality... - Dad, Dad. - And service. We got people coming in here... - I quit, Dad, I quit. - Whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? - I know how important the store is to you, and I know that you want me to follow in your footsteps. We don't wear the same shoes, Dad. - Course we do. We both wear size 10. And we're gonna have Verdi and Son Grocers right up out in front there. You're my partner. - Dad, don't do this. Please don't do this. I just ask you to believe in me. Have faith in me. (computer keys clacking) - I'm sorry, baby, I'm really busy. I would love to come, but I can't.

I will. - How do you know your music is good enough? - (scoffs) This is classic. This is where I walk out. - No, Anthony. I don't want you to pursue a fantasy. - The fantasy is you thinking that, by ignoring my music it'll go away. - And you think this is really the kind of life you want? (Anthony sighs) - I'm sorry, Val. I love you, Val. I'll always love you. (Val shuddering) - This doesn't belong to me anymore. Is there someone else? - I've just been learning to swing dance.

What about you? - My grandmother. - (chuckles) That's, that's cool. - Whenever I went over to her house, she'd put on a Glenn Miller, or a Tommy Dorsey record, move the coffee table out of the way and we'd swing. - Wow. - She always said that swing was a metaphor for life. I guess I grew up believing. What's wrong? - Your grandmother. - What about my grandmother? - Mrs. DeLuca. What was her first name? - Christine, like mine.
