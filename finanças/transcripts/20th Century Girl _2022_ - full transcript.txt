Huh? What? Uh, what's going on? Are you dating some foreigner? I have no idea what you're saying. "The forbidden love in everyone's dreams"? - Is it porn? You still watching that? - Mm... Dad, come on. I've never done that. I don't watch porn. My God. All right, all right. Fine, then. There's no need to yell at your father. I got all excited for nothing. I thought you were seeing someone. Hey, hey, hey. Are you coming down here when we move or not? - Oh, uh... - It's okay if you're too busy to come. It's fine. Us old folks can just throw out our backs carrying all the heavy stuff. - No, I... Mm... - Our kids are too busy, I guess. Do whatever you want! THE LOVE AFFAIR A FORBIDDEN LOVE OF EVERYONE'S DREAMS Hey, Kim Yeon-doo, are you crazy? Huh? 1999, CHEONGJU Aren't you supposed to be going to New York? You're not getting your heart surgery? Well, I'm not going, 'cause I don't have a heart. What are you talking about? My heart. Someone stole my heart, you know. Welcome. Oh, my mother stepped out for a second. Excuse me! I can take your sizes, though. Just hold on. Oh... BAEK HYUN-JIN Have you ever felt your heart flutter so much, it's life-threatening? Isn't that just from your heart disease? No, it was different. Have you ever seen me like this? Jae-ung in fifth grade. Middle school was, um... Choi Yeong-su, the track and field athlete. A substitute teacher that one time. Let's see, who else? Oh, yeah! Yeah. You said the last love of your life would be the man pictured on this cover. - I did all that for nothing? - Ugh! This time, it's really, really, really real. I haven't been able to sleep at night. And I may never, ever see him again! And even listening to music makes me cry. It's serious. I'm telling you. Ah! Quit that! Start packing! Hey! You think I'm like this for no reason? He had a uniform. The same uniform for the high school that we're going to! I don't want to leave now. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE AN EMAIL ACCOUNT? The password is "best friends forever." What are you supposed to do with it? After today, you'll see everything that happens to that guy. Like you're going to school with him. Bo-ra... Go get your surgery. When you come home, he'll be waiting, okay? Mm! Dear Bo-ra, I'm writing to you right after arriving at my aunt's house in America. It's a whole new world! America is huge, and the buildings are super tall! BORA VIDEO And there are people who look like movie stars everywhere. I'm serious! I can't believe I'm stuck in the hospital and can't experience it all. I wish you were here with me having fun. Anyway, today's finally your entrance ceremony. Come on! Wake up your sister! Hey. You didn't oversleep again, did you? Mom, Bo-ra is already awake. Wow, really? Something weird must be going on. You need your breakfast, honey. Whoa. What? Did she leave? BORA VIDEO Big day! You'll see that boy! - Bo-ra... - I'm so excited just thinking about it! What? You leaving? That day, I saw him walking toward the apartment buildings. So if you run to Lucky Apartments instead of going to the bus stop in our neighborhood to catch the bus, you might be able to meet him sooner. Hey! Sir! Sir, sir! Hey, sir! Sir! Oh! Thank you, sir. Thank you. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Oh! I'm sorry! Sorry! Oh! Hey! Watch it! Do you mind slowing down? Sit here. - Don't trip again. - Oh. Thank you so much.

WELCOME, 1999 SCHOOL YEAR CHEONGJU WOOAM HIGH SCHOOL - Hello, freshmen. - Boys over here, girls over there. Hey! What do you think you're wearing? Hey, where are you going? - Girls go this way and boys go that way. - Huh? - Come on now, go inside! - Ah! Huh? Darn it. Ugh. Darn it! How about that? A co-ed school. But this one has no boys. That doesn't mean that all hope is lost. Madam? Once the bell rings, the hungry boys and girls will all mingle together. Hey! Hey! Slow down. Slow down! Slowly, slowly! Bo-ra. There's something that I need you to do for me. I'm putting my faith in you. EVERYTHING YEON-DOO WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT "THAT BOY" He's 181 centimeters. He likes to drink Demisoda. Orange.

Hey, they have auditions. Wait. What is it? Nothing. Hey. What do they look for in the audition? I think they look for people who have enthusiastic voices or something. Enthusiastic voices? How do you show that? I'm so excited! Thank you! Thank you! All right, number three, Na Bo-ra. Oh! She's going to get in. Thank you. Next, number four, Baek Hyun-jin. Sorry, sir.

Future major in college? Theater and film or journalism and broadcasting. Theater and film. So he wants to be famous because he's kinda handsome, right? No. I just like cameras.

As a broadcaster. Well, how do you do it? Here. Put your eye right here. Put your hand here. This zooms in. And this zooms out. Don't press it too much. See? Yeah. Okay. I got it. You can go. Okay. Just be careful. - Wow. - You're so fast! She's amazing. She's so good. Guys! A fight! There's a fight! Paradise gang! - Really? - Let's go watch! Hey there's a fight! Let's go and watch. - Did you try to get my girl? - Come on, stop it! You stay out of this, Bok-soon. You know who I am? Who you're messing with? I'm Min Hong-gi, the fiery fists of this city. You messed with the wrong man's girl. You're gonna die tonight, man. Damn it! Seriously! I'm the one who started it, all right? You know how embarrassing you are? I'm sorry. Really. But... There's much better dudes than him. Just date better guys. - Mm-hm. - What the hell did you say? Huh? You asshole. Hey! - Who the hell was that? Get that bastard! - Huh? Get them! Run! Watch out! Watch out! Hey! Get out of my way! Get them! Come on! Let's go, let's go! Quick! Get them! Damn it. Come here! - Hold on. Hold on. - What? What, what? - It's the cops. - Sir, please get in the car. All right, then. I'll see you next time. - I'm asking you... - Yeah, keep laughing. Just ask the person over there. It wasn't me! I swear, I did nothing wrong. Hey! Are you insane? That guy was Paradise! Para! Be more careful, or you'll get yourself killed! Are you all right? Are you okay? I made you learn tae kwon do to protect yourself. But you're using it to get into fights with guys. Nobody wants to date a crazy person. Plenty of guys would date me. Whatever, then. Anyway, don't say that you got hurt in a fight when you get home. Your mother will worry. You know that she gets scared easily. I really wish that all guys were like you, Dad. I guess you have a good eye for men. Goodness. It was really humid yesterday. Hey, hey! You know the new internet café? I heard the guy who works there is super hot! - Let's go see! - Ooh! Yeah! You guys go ahead. I have broadcasting. - Huh? - Come on! Let's go together! Uh, I just can't. You guys go. - I gotta stay here. - Let's just go see him! Ah! Stop. Na Bo-ra, get on. He wants you to go! - Get on that bike! - Uh, but... What does he want? Oh, hey! We gotta take a right over here, okay? I don't know how to turn right. Huh? You... - Where are we going? Make a U-turn! - I don't know how to do that either. What? Ah... Hey! How can you drive like that? Huh? Sorry. I'm still learning. I borrowed it from a guy I know so I could give you a ride. Yeah? Why? Well, it's my fault you got hurt. So why'd you do it? Well, I, uh... I know someone who'd be really sad if you got hurt. You didn't want me to get hurt? I was afraid they'd beat you up pretty badly. Was I just supposed to let that happen? Huh? Also, you shouldn't be nice to just anyone. It's annoying for other people. Are we going out? Huh? What? That's what, uh... Was that your plan with all this? This is absolutely ridiculous. I have to go back to broadcasting. Fine. Get on. Huh? It's, uh... not starting. What? - Hey! - Wait, wait. Hey! I can do it. This, uh... this isn't that hard. How about we eat? Poong Woon-ho? When did you get here? Just a bit ago. I'll be right back. Have a seat. Were you, uh, here waiting for us? Sorry. - Mmm. - Let's date. Huh? I think you're great. Hey, hey. Have some of this. You think that... I'm great? Mm-hm. Why? You can't think that. You can't. Oh... Hey. I shove pizzas in my mouth. I'm not kidding. I just wanna pick up all your food right now and shove it in. Just look at this. Is this really someone you want? Mm! Mm! Mmm! That's good. You know the pizza place across the street? That's my dad's place too. Mmm... Really? Mm-hm. I rarely take showers. See this? See how oily it is? I haven't washed my hair in two days. I also have a lot of dandruff. Also, I'm terrible at math. I just write whatever. And my personality is terrible. My dad always says he feels bad for my future boyfriend. Oh, and I, um... I... I, um... fart so much I can sing you a song. I'm sorry. I better go. I blew it. It's about to blow! I thought you... had a crush on Hyun-jin. No, I don't. No. It's just, I'm interested. Same thing, right? Interest is... It's something totally different. It's not liking. So what's liking? You're all good. Try standing up. If you sprain your ankle once, it's easy to do it again. Next time, just use your fists. Good night. Yeon-doo. I think my heart is acting a bit weird too. YEON-DOO, A LOT HAPPENED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. ACTUALLY... I THINK HYUN-JIN LIKES M... BAEK HYUN-JIN IS A PLAYBOY. ABOUT THAT GUY, POONG WOON-HO... Never mind. I can take care of it. Did you get it? Two, three. Ah! Hey, scrunching your face won't make you look better. All right, smile. You, with the messy hair! Your hair's too big, you're covering people. Look at the others. Bend it down a bit more. All right. Okay. One, two, three... - Okay, now I'll take the picture. - Aaah! All right, now. This is mulberry extract. It's what Cheongju is famous for, right? It's great for ailments like high blood pressure, - chronic fatigue, cancer, dementia. - What are you... Great for hearts too! It's a great gift for your parents. Wait here a minute for me. How much for one, sir? 30,000 won. Here's 20,000. Here. Just a minute, please. Thanks. - Hey, do you have 3,000? - Here you go, sir. What? - You're somethin' else. - Uh... When we start dating, are you gonna let me hear you sing with your farts? Get out of here! Hey! Hey! Are you insane? Right in front of everybody? Ten, ten, two, three, five. Huh? You said you'd love me to death. Only my family and Woon-ho know my pager number. Now you. Bora Video. Ah, jeez! Uh, you, uh... you think I'm in love with you? I don't know what you're talking about! Stop messing with me and just get lost. Now! Give me that! So we're... not dating? You're driving me nuts. Your ears clogged or what? Huh? I would never, ever date you, not even if my life depended on it! You got that? Uh... my goodness. That was pretty intense. You freaked me out. You and I, we are... It's just... we're at the same school. We're classmates. We can be nothing more, nothing less. Is that clear? Okay, let's be classmates. - Give me that. - Sorry, no. - Hey! That's mine. - Nuh-uh. Don't mess with me! I have a really big dog! Uh... you have a big dog? Yeah! It's me! You got a problem with that? Hey, classmate! Wait up! I can hear those of you who are awake. Okay? - Hey. I think he's gone. - Yeah... My goodness. Would it kill you to organize your shoes before going to bed? So messy. My goodness. - Okay, he's gone. - He's gone, he's gone. Cheers! Ugh! - Ugh, it's bitter. - Oh, it tastes terrible. Huh? - Hey, hand me that. - Oh! - Let's mix it with that. - Yeah! No! This is for Yeon-doo! - It's mulberry! It's good for your heart! - Give it here. Darn it, she'll never know. Gosh! Jeez. - We can just put some water in it. - It's good for the heart. Much better. - Hey, this is really good! - Ah! Okay. Hold on. Cheers! Back smash! Aah. Ah. Sh... Darn it. Stop it. Gosh. Why do you keep sighing? Oh, jeez. Do you know what love is? Jeez. Huh? Huh? What are those punks doing? Oh... Hey! Hey! Hold on. - Hey, thank you for the drinks! - Oh. - How dare they? - What? Hey. Just wait. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Uh. Wait right there! - Open the door. - Not that room. It's the other one. Ah! Dang It! Just go away. I said I got this. Open up! I'll get you! Uh... Uh... I hear the teacher! Who's out of bed and making all this noise? You brats! Who's the one being so loud this late at night? I can hear everything going on! I was very clear. I want you in bed early. How hard is it? Huh? We've been walking around all day! How are you all not exhausted? Just go to sleep! Have... you been drinking? What? Do you want some honey water? My goodness, my goodness. Wake up and go down to the front lobby, now! Oh dear, dear, dear! - Oh my gosh. - Look at you. You're some real model students, huh? You stayed up all night and drank on a school field trip? We are all going to pick up trash. Grab a bag, fill it up. Let's go. There's some trash right there. Let's get it. Classmate. So that's how it is? What? What do you want? Hey! Let's take pictures together! Hey, move that way. Get away from me. Gosh. - Ugh. Just get away. - I don't want to. - What? - Ugh! - Hey, smile. - Don't talk to me. Look over there. One, two, three. I'm sending this picture so you can see it after you get out of surgery. And... I have something to tell you when you get back. Our break starts tomorrow for the summer. And all of us hope that your break is great, and we'll see you next semester. I start work tomorrow over there. I'll see you around. Enjoy. Welcome. Come on in. Do you want some? Oh, here you go. Enjoy. Welcome. Hey! Get your head in the game if you want to eat ice cream. Quickly. Ah! You leaving now? Hey. Is this your brother? Yeah. We've been playing badminton a lot lately. Say hi, Ba-da. Hello. - Hello. - Yeah. What are you doing out there? When are you guys coming in? Uh. We're, uh... exercising. You never exercise. That's enough. Come inside. - Hey, what's wrong? - Oh, they're out there messing around. - You need to go to bed. - Ah! Huh! Hello. Hello. Are you Bo-ra's friend? You guys have fun. Hey, what are you doing? - Come inside. - Honey, look at me. - Do you want a cucumber massage? - It's time for bed. - Let's go. - Get inside! - I'll massage you. - We don't have cucumbers! - I bought some. Come on. - Cucumbers all of a sudden? Here. Have mine. Really? Ah, thanks! If you want more, come to the store I work at. Mmm. Hey. Stop eating and go inside. Thank you for the ice cream, sir. I'll bring more. Jeez. What? Let him eat it. You don't have siblings. They're so annoying. I do have one. A brother. - Oh, you do? - Mmm. How old is he? Oh, he's five. - He's just a baby, then. - Yeah. I'd like to see him. That makes two of us. Hm? You, uh... you like fruit? So... where are we? I used to live here. Really? When was that? When I was born, before New Zealand. You've been to New Zealand? Seriously? Yeah. When my parents divorced, I moved back here with my dad. And my brother stayed there with my mother. I see. You must miss him. Wow! These look so good! Oh my God, there's so many plums! I planted that plum tree with my dad when I was young. It flowers in the spring. Well, plums are tastier than flowers. Hey. This is so good. Do you want one? Ugh. I'm so full. Jeez. Wow. You're lucky. You really are. You're good at so many things. You know what you wanna do. I don't have a clue. You are good at one thing. "Yes or No." Hey! Quit teasing. Your voice, it's pretty. Hmm. What? It's just... this is nice. Ah! - You okay? - Hey! - That was you, wasn't it? - Hey, I didn't do it. I know it was you! You all right? Hmm. Uh... So... You wanna... uh... go see a movie? And if not, whatever. I gotta go. Bo-ra. Let's go this weekend. Good night. Yeon-doo, remember what you told me a while ago? If you like someone... THIS IS A SECRET ...then you can't sleep at night. The food you eat becomes tasteless, and you start crying when you listen to music. Actually, I sleep fine at night. And food tastes even better. And I feel like dancing when I listen to music. It's weird, though. Not sure why, but when I think of him, my heart hurts a little bit. If this is love, if this is what it feels like, then I think I'm in love. The person I like... is... Oh! What's wrong with her? Ugh! Hey, Ma! All my clothes are awful! You picked those out yourself. - Gosh, why is she so... - When did I do that? - What's going on? - Ugh. Jeez. What's with her? Hey, classmate! Running errands? - Got a date? - Huh? Wow. You really do. Mm-mm. - What is it? Let me see. - No, don't. - Come on, show me. - No. I said no! Hello. - Hey! Hey! - Let's get some ice cream. Ugh... Ice... Hey. Hmm. Kim Yeon-doo? Bo-ra! There you are! - Yeon-doo! - Bo-ra! Yeon-doo! I missed you. This is my... closest... friend... Kim Yeon-doo. Say hi. Hello. Oh, yeah! Yes! It's so loud now! Aww! Right? I feel like I've been born again. You did so well. Yeah. I missed you. You know... - Hm? - I almost had a heart attack. I couldn't believe I saw Hyun-jin so soon. Jeez. He looked amazing, even wearing that stupid ice-cream uniform. - Uniform? - Mm-hm. When did he start working there? You left that part out. That's Poong Woon-ho. Hyun-jin was the other guy. No, the one in the uniform was Hyun-jin. - Huh? - Huh? Hold on. Let me see. HYUN-JIN Wha... Everything is wrong. Don't tell me you've been following the wrong person. Oh, jeez. Oh my gosh. Hold on. Woon-ho, Woon-ho. Hyun-jin. Baek Hyun-jin. Poong Woon-ho. HYUN-JIN I was just about to go to your house. Oh, it's gonna take them a few days to get my internet connection back up. By the way, the more I think about it, the funnier it gets. Oh! What have we been doing all this time? I'm so glad that Baek Hyun-jin is Woon-ho's best friend. - If he wasn't... - Yeon-doo, I... Uh... I have something to tell you. Oh? Tell me. What is it? HYUN-JIN OBSERVATION NOTES THIS IS A SECRET UNREAD THIS IS A SECRET DELETE DELETE Woon-ho! You must be surprised. Bo-ra's busy today, and she didn't have your phone number, so I... so I'm here instead. Well, is she all right? Yeah, I think Madam's father got injured or something, so she asked Bo-ra to help her out on the farm. Bo-ra cares about her friends. Uh... Thanks for being so kind. I thought I'd never see you again. You were a big help back at my mother's store. You lied. It's not fun. Shut up and pick the grapes. If you don't, I'll tell everyone I rejected you. Hey. Just 'cause I used to have feelings for you, doesn't mean you can be like this. You know that my family is quite influential, and this... You didn't even wash these grapes! - You're, uh... hiding something, aren't you? - Huh? Like what? Uh... Baek Hyun-jin? Oh boy. I know you like him. Hey. We could go on a double date. - How cool? - Ah! No! It's not like that. By the way, has Woon-ho... always been so sweet? He listened when I spoke. He paid for our food. He smiled at me too! He's amazing. He did that? Mm-hm. Hey. Tell me more about Woon-ho. Uh... I don't know. Not really sure. Hey. You're in Broadcasting Club together. You should show more interest in your friends. You said you'd help me get with him. Try to remember. Hm? What does he like? Oh... Well, I don't know. Hold on. You have one message. Press one to play. It's me, Poong Woon-ho. Give me a call. - Who was it? - Huh? Uh... It's a... wrong number. Ah. Okay. Hurry up, come back in. Hello? It's Bo-ra. What took you so long? I've been trying to reach you for a while. Oh... uh... What number is this, by the way? Are you at... a payphone right now? Huh? The one in front of your house? Yeah. Why? Start counting to ten. - Count to ten? - Yeah. Why am I counting? Just do it. One, two, three, four. Too fast. Slow down. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Call me on that one. Don't make your friend do all the work. She's your best friend? Hey. I heard that you've been running around, beating up on boys ever since you were a kid. You've always preferred kicking to punching? I guess I'm lucky I got to know you now. Woon-ho. I didn't show up today for a reason. Huh? I'm sorry. I think I've made a mistake. I just don't have those kinds of feelings. I'm sorry if you misunderstood. Na Bo-ra... I have to go now. TO NA BO-RA It's me. Woon-ho. I'm writing to you because I don't think I'll be able to say this face-to-face. I met you for the first time this winter. I saw you as soon as I arrived in Cheongju. You probably don't remember. THE LOVE AFFAIR Thank you! What's wrong? - Bo-ra? - No, no! What happened? You ran away so fast. It made me curious about the movie. When I first came to Korea... I'M ON A BUSINESS TRIP ...I rarely had any reason to smile. BAEK HYUN-JIN It fits perfectly. You can wear mine until you graduate middle school. - Hey. Try this on. - Thank you. Hey, sir, I need to get on! Hey, sir! I gotta get on! - Then... - Can you stop, please? - ...I met you again. - Hey, sir! I need to get on the bus! Hey, sir! Someone's getting on! All of a sudden, I started noticing the unpredictable things that you would do. Our tae kwon do girl. Are you late because you were smashing boards? Hey, you're so good at tae kwon do. What rank are you? - Me? - Yeah. I'm a red belt. - Whoa. - What? - That's when I realized it. - It's understandable. I was smiling whenever I looked at you. Toy. "The Days that Were Like Lies." Oh, thank you, sir, for your participation. After the next beep, please provide us with your pager number. Na Bo-ra? Who was it? No one. But you were always only interested in Hyun-jin. So sometimes, I got jealous. And sometimes, I got my feelings hurt. I had no idea if you knew how I felt about you. Your eyes are so pretty. Your nose is pretty. And your lips are pretty too. This isn't good. I think that I like you. You told me something so personal, but you forgot all about it, like it never happened. Was it really me that you were talking to? - What? - Or did you mistake me for Hyun-jin? I've wanted to ask you so many times... - Hey, Poong Woon-ho! - ...but I couldn't bring myself to do it. What? - I didn't wanna get hurt. - What? Oh, do you want one? Now I finally know how you feel. NEW ZEALAND SOON But I have to go back to New Zealand soon. I promise that I'll come back. I like you... Na Bo-ra. Woon-ho! How have you been? - Good. - What did you do over break? - I worked and stuff. - Hmm. - Hey, classmate. - Do you wanna come with us later? Sure. LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY "POONG WOON-HO, NA BO-RA" You should be putting finishing touches on the videos. Good. Dismissed. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. We don't have to be partners, you know. No, don't worry about it. In the next century, the world might end. That would be a big shame, you know? Nostradamus's prophecies have never been wrong. What do you mean? I wanna go on blind dates in college... - Hey! - Oww! - There's more to college than that. - Ugh! - What? - Well... - What? - What? Hey. Uh... Can we just finish this? Good work. Are you guys done now? - Mm. Just need to edit. - Oh. The editing machine we have here is old, though. - So we'll see. - Oh... Oh! I know someone with machines at SBS. Want me to ask? Go ahead, sir. Go ahead. Huh? Hey! What are you doing here? I know the area of Seoul really well. So you can change those two cuts with the button. And when you dissolve, push this down right here. Like this. But gently. - Wow! - Because of the overlapping part, this dissolve works best when you do it gently. Try it. I'm asking Woon-ho out today. - Today? - Yeah. Look. My uncle gave us Seoul Land tickets. Can you just help me find alone time with him, please? - Yep. Drink. - Mm. Come on, come here. - What? - Just come here. Hey, you two stand close to each other. One, two... Hey. Let's do a different one. Why? I wanna get on this one too. - Come on. Just come. - Hey! Come on. Let's go, Yeon-doo. - What's the matter? - That one's no fun. I'm telling you, it'll be fun! - This is so fun! - Isn't it fun? Yeah. Have you been on this before? This is my first time. It's so fun! Wow! Giddy-up! Hey, don't do that! Why? Yeon-doo! One, two. FAINT-HEARTED, BEWARE Yeon-doo, let's go on a different one. - Hey, come here. - Uh... I'm coming. Which one? You're avoiding rides 'cause of me. No, that's not it. Why do you say that? You guys should just pick the rides you wanna go on. I'll watch you. All right, then. Let's go. Rollercoaster? Hey! Don't you have any tact? Bo-ra. You guys should go. I know you love riding the big rides. I'll wait here. Okay. You're right. We will. Hey, let's go on a rollercoaster. We're going, so you guys just hang out here, okay? What's wrong? You keep changing your mind. - You don't want to? - Yeah! Should we sit here? - Mm. - Mm. Should we, um... see what's going on over there? Yeon-doo, I... I wanna ride the, uh... the rollercoaster too, I'm sorry. Ah, that looks so fun. Right? Mm. I'll get on. Passing by. Why are you here? Woon-ho wants time with Bo-ra. You think he's all right? What? Woon-ho... He's afraid of heights. What? Then, um... then why... Well, those two... like each other. Hey. What's wrong? I... I'm afraid of heights. What? Then, uh... why did you get on? I wanted... to go with you. Na Bo-ra! I like you! I'll go get us some water, if you'd like? Na Bo-ra. Now you know before I leave again. You're leaving? Yeah, I'm moving. I'm going back to New Zealand. That's wonderful. Oh, really? Do you really think so? You said you miss your brother. Now you'll be together. I thought you'd be sad... because I'm leaving. So that's good. Thanks for everything. Na Bo-ra. You must be tired, huh? Wanna get food? We could get some food at my house. What's wrong? Are you in pain? - You have something to tell me? - Huh? You have feelings for Woon-ho. You like him, no? Why didn't you tell me? It... it was while you were gone. I... I don't... I... I'm over him, though. How do I know you're being honest? You've been keeping this from me this whole time. It was more than I knew how... I didn't know how to handle it, Yeon-doo. - It was all for you. - Seriously? You're unbelievable, Na Bo-ra. You made me look like a fool, and yet you say this was all for me? You weren't just doing it to make yourself feel better? Yeon-doo, I... I didn't know what else I was supposed to do. I know it must have been so frustrating to leave and go have your surgery. I know you liked him and I know you were obsessed with getting his details. So how could I ever say something like that to you? I didn't want my stupid dumb feelings just over some guy to ruin our great friendship. - You know? - Some guy! It's because of you we're in this situation. Even though I like Poong Woon-ho, I would give him up in a heartbeat if it meant preserving our friendship. You're the person I care about the most. I know you always try to take care of me 'cause I'm ill. It's not something I need from you. I need a friend, not a nurse. Dad, I'm here. I'm going to be late again. Have you finished packing? No. Not yet. You should start packing, since you're leaving next week. Dad. Are you not gonna regret this? Listen to your mother when you get to New Zealand. And take care of your brother. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bo-ra. I think Yeon-doo is feeling tired. She doesn't want to talk right now. Did you guys have an argument? Oh, it's not that. I'll just... I'll just call back later. Okay. HYUN-JIN OBSERVATION NOTES TRASH THIS IS A SECRET The guy I like is... Poong Woon-ho. P.S. I'm glad that you're the first person that I'm talking to about my feelings. Maybe friendship and love aren't so different after all. Never forget that you're always number one in my heart, Yeon-doo. Woon-ho. You know, I really liked you. Yeon-doo. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but... Bo-ra likes you too. She told me about it. Um... what do you mean? She lied about it because she's such a good friend. That's the kind of girl she is. She makes pizzas completely disappear. Yet with me, she only eats a couple of slices. She holds back and pretends to be full. But she can't take her eyes off the pizza. And she told me she was an SES fan, although she actually likes Fin.K.L. She couldn't tell me because I'm a huge fan of SES. Oh, yeah, and also... once, at a picnic, I actually fainted because I got scared of a frog, and Bo-ra carried me all the way down the mountain on her back. She was only 12 years old. And I'm sure I was very heavy, but she pushed all the way. She said she was fine. I'm sure she was tired. She's pretty bananas. Oh! Oh! Ba-da! - Ba-da! Ba-da! - One, two. Oh, Ba-da! Oh, no! - Honey, my Ba-da! - Meet us there, okay? Come here, Mom. I'm closing the door. Ba-da! Na Bo-ra! It's Woon-ho. I'm leaving tomorrow. I have something for you. I'm in front of your house. It's not too serious. I think he can be released tomorrow after observation. - Really, sir? - Thank goodness. Everything is all right? Yes, fine. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you. Go get some sleep, okay? Your mom and I can stay here. No. What if he wakes up and I'm not here? He'll be upset. Jeez. Look at you. You two used to fight all the time. You're a good big sister after all. - Hey, hey, hurry up. - I'm so sleepy. Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Na Bo-ra! - Oh. - Oh, hey, hey. - Is Ba-da okay? - What happened? - Have you eaten? - I'm sure not. We bought snacks. - Oh. Yeah. Let's eat that. Hey, she collapsed! She collapsed! Yeon-doo! Yeon-doo! Yeon-doo! Yeon-doo! Pick her up! Yeon-doo! Yeon-doo, wake up! Yeon-doo! Yeon-doo! Please! Please! Na Bo-ra, you idiot. - Let me down. I'm fine. - Huh? Yeon-doo! Are you okay? Acting is really difficult. Remember, my surgery was a success. What? Why'd you do that? You can't let Woon-ho go. Baek Hyun-jin's outside. I'm okay. Now hurry up and go. I feel my role here shrinking. I guess I'm the driver now. You should feel honored. Hop on. Thank you. Oh! Woon-ho! Poong Woon-ho! I'm sorry. What for? I didn't show up at that movie, and I never said why. I was always busy when you were shooting. And I ate too many plums that one day. I'm sorry. I was actually so sad when you said you were leaving for New Zealand, and I just acted like I was okay with it! That wasn't how I really felt. And I... I lied... I lied to you when I said I didn't like you! I'm sorry. What's so funny? What are you so sorry for? You can just tell me that you like me. How can I say something like that here? I'm sorry. We're in public. When I'm with you, I... I'm always happy. I like you, Na Bo-ra. I like you. What was that? I can't hear you! I like you too! I like you too! I really, really like you! Wait for me just a little bit. I'll definitely come back for you. This is the last call for passengers... I need to go now. Okay? Don't cry. Okay? And just like that, we said goodbye. LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY Let us begin the 27th Wooam Festival! LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY It's me, Woon-ho. So far, living here is pretty fun. I usually spend a lot of time with my brother. If the world doesn't end on New Year's Day in 2000, then I'll write you an email before anything else. - You're buying, classmate. - P.S. - No way. - How are Hyun-jin and Yeon-doo? One Demisoda, please. - Which flavor? - Orange. Don't even get me started. You should see these two. - Hear the audience? - Ten! Nine! - Don't stay there, come out! - Eight! Seven! - Let's watch it together! - Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! It's the first day of the year 2000. Happy New Year, everyone. The world didn't end. New Year's Day was four hours ago here. Welcome to the year 2000. Just like you said, the plum tree's flowering. Still, plums are tastier than flowers. S.A.T. D-169 I'll apply for Journalism and Broadcasting in Seoul. MY GOAL IS SEOUL! I hope we can go to college together in Korea next year. CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING... You got in! You got in! Bo-ra got in! Really? Oh! Oh, great, Bo-ra! - What is it? - Honey! - Bo-ra made it! - She did it? REFRESH CHECK INBOX UNREAD POONGWH2000 Nothing happened to you, right? I'll be waiting for your response. I can't answer the phone right now. Please leave me a message if you need anything. I kept on waiting, but I never heard from Woon-ho again. Emergency medicine? - I packed it! - The digestive pills? - Oh. - Which bag? - Which bag? - I put them under here. - Wait. - You just checked I put them there. - I gotta go now! - Yeah, go, go. Go, already. Get inside. - Okay. - Go, go. Just gonna watch you until you go. - Just go. - Go on! - All right. Come on. - Ugh! Seriously. - I'm closing the door. - Go! Off you go. - Get out of here. - Go inside. - Call us when you're there, okay? - Okay! - Bo-ra. - Bo-ra. - Na Bo-ra! - Are you done? - Yeah. - Let's go! Did you wait for long? - You must be hungry. - You wanna eat? - I'm craving Western food. - Western food? - Hey, how about some pasta? - Ooh, pasta. - A really good pasta place just opened. - Sure. - Want to check it out? - When? Only thing is, there's a really long wait sometimes. Yes. Could you tell us what year you are in school and what your major is, please? - Thank you. - Hello. I'm Bang U-ri. I'm a biology major and I'm a senior this year. - Bo-ra! - To introduce... - We don't have much time. - Okay. - What's one good thing... - Let's go. And gradually... I stopped thinking about Woon-ho every day. Take this one seriously. Don't turn him down if he wants to see you again. - Okay? - Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Oh. Hello. Ah. Hello. - You're here for the blind date, right? - Yeah. I'm sorry I'm a bit late. It's okay. Oh. Uh... So, I am, uh... Na Bo-ra. It's a pleasure. Bo-ra. Your name is very pretty, you know. Oh. I'm Woon-ho. Uh, Jung Woon-ho. Nice to meet you too. Not sure how these blind dates usually go. This is actually the first time I, uh... You see, all my friends pressured me into doing this. Though I didn't know you'd be so... Um... Bo-ra... Uh... Bo-ra, what happened? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, I... I didn't do anything. I'm sorry. Bo-ra, uh... Please don't cry, Bo-ra. You want some water? Please, can you drink some wa... The number you have reached is not in service. - Please check the number or try again. - Gonna get over you for real now! Not gonna wait! It's easier to think that you're just dead. And don't call me later! That won't work! You don't have any more chances! And I do not miss you either! So have a great life, you little bastard! Mom. Dad? WOOAM GREEN APT 2 AERIAL VIEW OF RECONSTRUCTION THE ETERNAL SPRING REMEMBERING POONG WOON-HO When I was moving, I found a package that Woon-ho had hidden. That was 15 years ago, maybe even more after he died. At first I was surprised he had hidden the tape, you know. It's obvious it was special. I felt like I had to send it. So I went ahead and contacted you, and even arranged this exhibition. And if it made you uncomfortable, I'm truly sorry. Not at all. Thanks for the invitation. 'Cause otherwise, I might... be angry still. I might have been forever. Actually... I was upset at you for a while. I was really worried he'd... he'd go back to Korea for you. Looking through the materials for the exhibition, I followed Woon-ho's gaze. That's when I realized... you're the person he truly wanted. So I felt I needed to tell you just how alive... how alive he felt when he was with you. And how much he truly cared about you. I realized, watching it, that the happiest moments in Woon-ho's short life was when he was with you. You mattered. So I want to thank you for being there. And for remembering him. How could I... how could I forget Woon-ho? My goodness. I'm going to sell all these. Way back then, everyone was so eager to watch them. You know, you used to sneak off with porn back in the day, remember? Huh? When did I do that? Ah, you think I didn't notice you taking it when your friends were here? - What? I never did that. - I just pretended I didn't know. - Uh... - Come on, I knew all about it. Jeez. So, is Mom liking the brand-new house? Ah. Just let her be. When we first came here, I told your mother we'd make a whole lot of money and then we'd buy a nice house. We've been here for so long. - Hey, just leave that. Leave it. - Why? Those movies have sentimental value. They're the ones your mom and I love. You and Mom. My God. You're still in love. Mmm. Aww, I wish all men could be as sweet as you. You've got wonderful taste. Let's go. - Dad. - Hm? Um, do we still have any VCRs left? Oof.
