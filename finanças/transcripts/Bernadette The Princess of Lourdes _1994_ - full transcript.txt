A long time ago, there was a very poor girl who lived in Lourdes. Her name was Bernadette Soubirous and she didn't know it, but something extraordinary was about to happen to her.

(woman grunts) - Stop, madam. - Commissioner Jacomet, but I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Just go away, you. (children gasp) You caused this, running around like a bunch of lunatics. - Excuse us Mr Jacomet, but we're on our way to catechism and we're running late. - Catechism? They should be teaching you to behave yourselves instead. (bell rings) - Sorry Mr Jacomet. - And to show some respect for authority and public order. (bell rings) - Answer me, Bernadette, who are the three persons of the most Holy Trinity. (Bernadette mutters) - I don't know. - Beg your pardon mother, but my sister has been ill with asthma and she's had to care for our little brothers. She's missed a lesson or two. - Don't think you'll be allowed to receive first communion without knowing such a simple thing. (footsteps patter) - Tell me child, do you love Jesus? - Oh yes, father, I do love him very much. I want to receive first communion more than anything in the world. - Very well. Still, you must learn your catechism. - Yes Father Peyramale. (classical music) - Is father bringing food tonight Mama, I'm really hungry. - Yes, John. Yes. (door creaks) (footsteps patter) (sighs) - It's the best I could do Louise. - The important thing is we're together. Don't you worry Francois, God will provide. (classical music) - Thanks. - Blessings oh Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy body through Christ our Lord, amen. - (crowd) Amen. (Bernadette coughs) - Bernarde, Bernadette, Let's go play. (door creacks) Bernarde. (shush sound) - Where do you think you are going? I know you have no school today, but before you go out and play, could you go gather some wood for the fireplace? - Can I go too mama? - No dear, I heard you coughing last night and I don't want you to get sick again. - But mama, I got my stockings on, besides we need a lot of wood and they'll need help to carry it home. - Well, all right. - [Children] Shalom - But keep yourself warm Bernadette, do you hear? - This way. - Are you sure? - Come, I'll show you. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) There, we'll find some wood over there. - Not there, that used to be a pig sty. - Who cares, we need wood. Look there, plenty of sticks. We'll just wade across. - Wait. - Over there, it's a big one. (wind howling) (Bernadette gasps) (wood cracking) (Bernadette gasps) (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) (grunts) (both sigh) We need help. Where's Bernadette. - Look, what's with her. - Is she praying? - How silly of her to pray there. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) (Bernadette giggles) - Hey, you said the water was cold. But I think it's nice. - Bernadette, are you all right? - We were worried about you. What were are you staring at? - Didn't you see? - No, what. - It was a, if I tell you what I saw, do you promise not to tell anyone? - Yes. - Now, what did you see Bernadette? - I saw a lady. She was very young and beautiful. Dressed all in white, and she wore a blue stash around her waist and she had golden roses on each foot. - And what did she want? What did she say? - She didn't say anything. I just prayed the rosary and she followed silently, now you mustn't tell. You must promise. - Lourdes girl sees heavenly apparition. A Holy spirit appears at the Massabielle pig sty. - Give me one boy. (crowd) - What on earth. Here now, let me see. What's all this nonsense, who's this girl. (footsteps patter) - As if we didn't have enough problems. Now my daughter is hallucinating. - But mother, I saw her, I saw the lady. - Bernadette, there's never been anything that anyone could say against our family. You're not going to start something now. - But father. - You must stay away from the grotto. - Yes, father. (crowd chattering) (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Hey Bernadette, what do you see now a giant tower? - [Crowd] Bernadette's crazy, Bernadette's crazy. (crowd giggles) (Bernadette gasps) - Who are you to claim to see spirits from heaven you're nothing but a peasant girl. - But I never said anything about spirits. - Don't touch her. I know this girl. She's my niece and my godchild, and she's no liar. Bernadette, if you say you saw the lady, then I believe you. Come show me. - Can we ask mama and papa first? (old woman grunts) (crowd) (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Now child, be sure and get her name. Ask her to write it down. (Hitorideutauinouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - She's here. (Hitorideutauinouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) There she is. - Don't forget to ask her name. - [Man] I don't see anything, do you? - [Man] No, I don't know what she's looking at. - [Bernadette] Madam, would you be so kind, as to write down your name? - There is no need to write down what I have to say. Would you do me the favor, to come to this place for 15 days. - After asking permission from my parents, I will come. - [Woman] I don't see anything. - I do not promise to make you happy in this world, but in the next. - As a new member of the police force, you are now the authority, people will respect and obey you. Madam, monsieur. You are to use your authority and power to maintain law and order in Lourdes. - Yes, yes monsieur commissioner. (great vincent price sinister ennui) - But, what's all this. What in the name of reason is going on. Stop, don't touch me. What, hey, will you stop it. Oh no. - Hello monsieur. - Wait a minute here. What's all this, just where are you going? - It's the Soubirous girl. The one who has been seeing the apparitions. She has a message from heaven. Please excuse me, monsieur. (footsteps patter) (grunts) - The lady of the grotto has ordered me to tell the priest, that she wishes to have a chapel at the grotto. - And just, what is this lady's name? - I don't know. When I ask her, she smiles gently, but doesn't say. - Bernadette, you must realize this is a very serious thing in both the eyes of the church and the eyes of God. - Yes Father Peyramale. - You would do well to forget this whole thing. I urge you not to return to the grotto ever again. Rather prepare yourself for first communion. (footsteps patter) - What happened? What did he say? - Bernadette Soubirous, come with me. - You cannot arrest her. She's done nothing wrong. - I am not arresting her, Commissioner Jacomet wishes to question her. Follow me. - Yes sir, wherever you wish. Don't worry aunt Bernard, I'll be fine. (crowd) - [Man] Let her go, she's no criminal. - [Woman] Yeah, she's just a girl, leave her alone. - Where is my daughter? - You are nothing but a little liar. Now you must promise never to go to the grotto again. - I cannot do that. I promised the lady, I would go there for 15 days. - Then, you go to prison. - I am the father of this child. - Then you are responsible for her. You better stop her foolish charade or else. - Yes, yes Chief Jacomet I'm only too pleased to put an end to it all. (classical music) - She is torn between obeying us and obeying the lady. She's never lied to us before. What if she's right? What if it is a lady from heaven? (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - And, what about Jacomet and his threats. - Not even Jacomet has the right to fight God. - Bernadette, if the lady wants you to go to the grotto, you can go. - And we will go with you. - Oh mama, papa. (man snores) (door creaks) (old classical music) - She's coming, she's coming. (sighs) - What's going on? Stop, stop. In the name of the law. - You have no right to stop us. - Yeah, let her go. - [Crowd] Yeah. - [Man] She's just a girl. - [Crowd] Let her go, she's done nothing wrong. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Please dear child, pray for this crippled woman so I can take better care of my little boy. - I'll take your cloak. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Take the candle child. - Our father art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. - (crowd) Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. - Should we arrest her? No, I have a feeling she'll hang by her own rope today. (laughs) (wind howling) - [woman] Can't see her, but she's there. - Please dear lady, would you be so kind as to tell me your name. - Penance, penance, penance. Pray to God for the conversion of sinners, kiss the ground in penance for the conversion of sinners. (thunking sound) - What is she doing? (crowd chattering) - Go and drink at the spring and wash yourself in it. Not there Bernadette, the spring drink and wash from the spring. Go and eat the weed which you will find there. (footsteps patter) (crowd chattering) (crowd laughing) - Look, Bernadette's a pig. (snorts) - She's lost her head, the girl's crazy. - [Louise] Stop it Bernadette, let's go. (crowd chattering) - As mayor of Lourdes, I want to propose a toast to our most esteemed and capable chief of police Dominique Jacomet. - [Crowd] To Jacomet. - Thank you gentlemen. It was not easy putting an end to this Bernadette Soubirous business, but it was my duty, and even against great odds I emerged victorious. I assure you gentlemen, you will hear no more of miracles from that grotto, and as for young Bernadette, I expect to take her where she belongs. To a mad house. (crowd laughing) - Is it possible? Could she be telling the truth? - Mama, mama look. - A spring, right where she was digging, she knew there was water here. - And it's clean too. (water bubbling) - My arm, my arm I can move it. It's a miracle, it's a miracle. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) A miracle, a miracle. - No, it cannot be. (water bubbling) - It's a miracle. My neighbor, Louis recovered his sight when he washed from the spring. - My own sister drank this water and now her diphtheria is gone. - Enough, (clears throat) our local pharmacist has tested this water and found it unhelpful. I hereby forbid anyone from taking so much as a drop from this spring. (footsteps patter) Cease all the bottles and throw them away. (classical music) - Here, take them back. - You keep this one young man. You surely need it too. (soft classical music) - The spring you discovered is a remarkable thing, Bernadette. You know that, don't you? - Oh yes father, aunt Bernard says many people have. - All right, all right. I've also seen many people coming back to the faith to confession and communion. That's more important. So the lady wants us to build a chapel and have processions to the grotto, does she? - Yes, that's what she said. - Ask the lady, her name once more and when we know her name, we'll see. (wind howling) (classical music) - Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Look at Bernadette, she's beautiful. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - Madam, will you be so kind as to tell me who you are? Oh, madam, will you be so kind as to tell me who you are? Oh, madam, I beg you, will you do me the favor telling me your name? (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - I am the Immaculate Conception. - I am the Immaculate Conception. - What's that you say, - I am the Immaculate Conception. The lady has just said these words to me. I am the Immaculate Conception. - And do you know what that means? - No. - Have you ever heard those words before? - No. - Bernadette, it means that she is Mary, the mother of God. It also means that she herself was created without sin. I believe you now Bernadette, and I'm sure all the church will too. - Well, well, I thought I'd find you here. I am here to arrest this girl. - And what are the charges? - According to the law, any person suspected of mental disorder shall be interned for treatment. Besides, she has been the cause of serious public disorder. - Gentlemen, Bernadette is not crazy. And she has caused no disorder. You will have to walk over my dead body before you touch this child. (grunts) (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - [Narrator] So finally Francis, came the most important day in Bernadette's life. She was granted her dearest wish to make her first communion. in the grotto, she had been visited by the mother of God. Now she received in her heart, the greatest visitor of all, Jesus, the son of God. That's why we've come here to Lourdes son. To the same spring that our loving mother Mary showed to Bernadette. This water has cured many in body as well as spirit. (footsteps patter) Are you ready Francis? The water is cold. - I'm ready. (water splashing) (Francis groans) - Enough, it's time to stop all this nonsense. He'll catch his death of a cold. (Francis moans) - Mama, daddy. I can se you, I can see you. And my legs, I can feel them, I can. - It's a miracle. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) God, forgive me. I have been so bitter, I had been blind myself and now I can see, I believe. (woman crying) (birds chirping) (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria) - [Narrator] As Mary requested, a chapel was built at the grotto and people began to come in procession from all over the world. Many of the sick recover physically, yet many more people recover spiritually. They go to confession, say the rosary, do penance and pray for sinners. Mary leads them to Jesus. Bernadette became a nun. In 1933, she was declared a saint. 50 years later, Pope John Paul the second visited Lourdes to echo the eternal message of Mary, the mother of Christ. She who alone can say I am the Immaculate Conception. (Hitorideutauainouta Voiceless by GramooMaria)
