(playful music) (alarm blaring) (gasping) (thudding) - Jenny! - Thanks. - Jenny, you mess with my alarm clock one more time it's gonna be the last thing you do. - What'd I do? - Oh, don't give me that. - She turned up the volume on my radio. It's lucky I can even hear. - Jenny, you know better. - I was just playing a little joke. - Not like those we don't. - Yeah, I'd like to see you try it again, kiddo. - Scare me. - Yeah, you'll be scared. - All right, you two. - You were out kind of late last night. - Yeah, I was helping a friend study for a big English test we've got today. - He was helping Tamara. - Jenny. - Tamara? - She's just a friend from school. - Danny's in love with her. - Will you be quiet? - Danny and Tamara, sittin' in a tree. - Dad, shut her up. - That's enough comedy, Jenny. - Go finish getting ready for school. - Okay. - Well, how's it going with her? - You know, Dad, everybody just sees me as a nice guy, that's all. Nobody wants to date a, you know, my tombstone's gonna read, "Here lies Dan Burgess, a real nice guy, "and a lonely one, too." - Oh, come on, Son, you'll meet the right one. Just be patient. - Yeah, patience. - K-I-S-S-I-N-G. - [All] Jenny! (gentle music) (engine idling) (gentle music) (engine revving) (gentle music) - Hey, Mrs. Moore. - Hi, Dan. (gentle music) (car door opening and closing) - So how did it go? - What do you mean? - Last night, with Tamara. - What? We studied. - Come on, man, you know what I mean. - I said we studied. - Hey, Burgess. Gonna let me cheat off you in that English test today? - Oh, I hadn't planned on it, Doug. - Why don't you ask Mr. Milner. I'm sure he won't mind if you ask. - Doug really gets to me sometimes. - You know Doug. - I mean, I don't understand it, he mocks God, yet he gets all the girls. He's got a great car, everyone bows down to him. He's got it all. - No, man, Doug's got nothing if you don't have the Lord. - Yeah, right. I'll see you in class. - We need to keep trying to reach him. - Come on, Ricky, we're not affecting Doug or any of those guys. They just see us as a couple of goody-two-shoes, that's all. (students chatting) - [Tamara] Thanks for helping me last night. - Tamara. - I'd seriously flunk this test today if you hadn't helped me. - Oh, don't worry, you're gonna do great. - Well I want you to know I really appreciate it. - Um, Tamara, I was wondering if um, after school-- - Tammy, baby, you're looking good today. - Doug. - You going to Randy's party tomorrow night? - I wouldn't miss it. - What about you, Danny, you coming? - Uh, I don't know, I don't think so. - Oh, what's the matter, Mommy won't let you out on a school night? - No, no, no, Burgess has got to get his rest for the weekend. What you got coming up, buddy? Big church hayride? (laughing) Come on, Tammy. Tammy, after the party, we'll get together. (students chatting) - It is my lady, oh, it is my love. Oh, that she knew she was. - Hey, Mr. Milner. - Take my counsel, comrade, be careful with young love. - Yeah, but Tamara's special, Mr. Milner. - I guess we'll see. - Tough test today? - It'll be a little bit of everything. Essay, matching, multiple choice, connect the dots, find the bunny. (uplifting music) - So how's FCA going? - Hmm? - Fellowship of Christian Athletes? - Oh, good. We're showing a film after school Friday. - Well I hope you get some response. - What? - I said I hope you get some response. - Yeah, me too. - What are you looking at? - He's got the hots for Tamara. - Tamara Howard? - Thanks, Todd. - He wants to ask her out. - Cool it, Todd. - I told you to forget it, man. She's after Doug. - Cool it, Todd. - Besides, she won't date you, Dan. You're too nice of a guy. Tamara's not in the market for nice guys. - Cool it, Todd. - Okay. - Tammy, baby. - Come on, Ricky, let's get out of here. - I like nice guys. - Hey, Mike. - Hey. (kids chatting) - What's wrong, Bull? - That punk's trying to steal my girl. - Ricky? - I saw him staring at Melanie while she was at her locker. - Bull, I don't think anybody in their right mind is trying to steal your girl. - But I saw him. - Bull, you're gonna drive yourself crazy. You can't go around suspecting everybody who looks or talks to Melanie. I mean, I even talk to her now and then. What I mean, Bull, is that if you love Melanie, and she loves you, then you have to trust one another. If you don't this trust, then you don't have true love, and it won't last. - You think so? - I know so, Bull. When you trust you remove all those jealous fears. - You got a roving eye, little man. If I ever catch you looking at Melanie again, you're dog meat, pal. We'll talk more later. - Sure, Bull. - All right, now the principal's ok'd us to put these posters up, so let's get them up right away. Now look, we gotta get some guys to come to this thing, 'cause it's really gonna make them think about eternity. Do all the teams know about it? - Yeah, I told the basketball players. - I got football. - Baseball knows. - What about wrestlers? - I'm gonna tell them today. - Come on, man, what have you been doing? The film's Friday. What are you waiting for? - I'll tell them today. - All right. I'm sorry, Nick. All right, meet back here tomorrow, same time, and we'll pray about this thing. That's it, guys, thanks. - You okay, buddy? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. (students chatting) - Hi, Lucy. - Hey. - Do you know where Scotty is? - Yeah, he's right over there. - Thanks, bye. (students chatting) Hey, Scotty. - Hey, Dan. The Bible's coming alive to me, I just can't get enough of it. - That's great, I'm happy for you. Listen, I can't meet with you today. I have to take care of a couple of things, okay? - Oh, okay. - But I promise I'll meet with you tomorrow, same time. I'll do my best to answer any of your questions, all right? - All right, that's fine. - Thanks, buddy. I'll talk to you later. - Hey, Dan? - Yeah? - Jesus, man. - Now's your best shot, buddy. - I don't know, Ricky. - Listen, Dan, it's not like you're gonna marry her. You just want to take her to get a bite to eat. It's not even a date. - Why am I so nervous? - Go on, get it over with. - Okay, I'm going. - Besides, if she shoots you down, your troubles are over. - Hey, Tamara. - I'm really nervous. - Oh, don't worry about the test, you're gonna ace it. - I just hope I pass. - Um, Tamara, I was wondering, if you're not gonna be busy tomorrow night. - Well, yeah, I'm going to Randy's party. Aren't you going? - Uh, no, I don't think so. - You're gonna miss a great time. - Well what about this weekend? Uh... - Dan, are you trying to ask me out? - No, no, I, I, I just thought that maybe we could get a bit to eat and talk a little bit. - Listen, Dan, we're good friends, right? - Yeah. - Well I wouldn't want anything to ruin our friendship. I mean, you're a real nice guy. Some girl is gonna be really lucky to get you. - I understand, Tamara. - See you in class. (melancholy music) - All right, students, it's time for all of you to destroy my waning faith in the American educational system. It's time for me to realize that there's about as much interest in English literature as there is in taking prune juice, huh? Huh? Huh? (students laughing) Everyone will keep his eyes on his own test. You have 40 minutes. - Tamara. (suspenseful music) - Tamara. (suspenseful music) Give it to Tamara, come on. Come on. Tamara? (suspenseful music) - Tamara? (suspenseful music) Tamara? Tamara? - [Mr. Milner] What's that in your hand, Mr. Burgess? - I, I, I don't know, sir, I just found it on the floor. I thought it fell off Tamara's desk. - These are the answers to the multiple choice questions. You were trying to help Tamara cheat, weren't you? - No, Mr. Milner. I just found it on the floor. I thought it fell off Tamara's desk. - [Mr. Milner] Come with me, Mr. Burgess. - But, Mr. Milner, I-- - [Mr. Milner] Come with me. - I was doing all right. I didn't need your help. - [Dan] I wasn't trying to help you-- - Mr. Burgess! I want you to take this note to the principal's office. - Mr. Milner, I can explain-- - You'd given me hope, Dan. I actually thought you weren't like the rest. That perhaps your faith had given you some sound principles. But I see now how easily you were ready to sell them for some teenage crush. - Mr. Milner, please, would you let me explain. Please... (door slamming) - But how could you get suspended? - It's a bum rap, I told you. - You should have never picked up that paper. - How was I to know what it was? - Son, you need to be more careful. - I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. - Well think next time. - I'll tell you, Dad, I'm fed up. I don't know how much more I can take. You know what's going on tomorrow night? A big party at Randy's house. Everybody's gonna be there except for me, of course, because I'm too good to go. - A lot of kids won't be there. - Yeah, a bunch of nerds. - Is Ricky a nerd? Come on, Son, we've talked about this. - And Tamara, Dad? I think she'd go out with me if I lived on the edge a little more. Dan, you're a really nice guy. Some girl's really gonna be lucky to get you. - Come on, Son. - I'm not impacting anyone for Christ, Dad. They just see me as the nice guy, that's all. I'm not affecting anyone for Jesus. - You're just feeling sorry for yourself. - No, I'm missing all the fun. - No, you're missing all the sin. - Yeah, maybe so, but I'm fed up. - Look, you'll feel better in the morning. Good night. (door opening and closing) - Yeah, things are really gonna be different in the morning. (paper rustling) - [Doug voiceover] Oh, what's the matter? Mommy won't let you out on a school night? No, no, no, Burgess has got to get his rest for the weekend. What you got coming up, buddy, big church hayride? - [Tamara] I mean, you're a real nice guy. Some girl is gonna be really lucky to get you. - Why do they get to have all the fun? I wish I was never a believer. (bells ringing) (mysterious music) (chiming) (light music playing) (groaning) (clattering) - Oh, oh. (groaning) (thudding) Mom? Dad? Thanks for letting me use your car. I'll be home by 5:00, love, Mom. PS, I made you some biscuits. (tapping) What a mess. (chiming) (trash rustling) - Hello, Daniel. - Oh, you startled me. What can I do for you? - I've been sent to talk with you. - Oh, look, whatever you're selling, I'm not buying. - I'm not selling anything, Daniel. I'm here to talk with you about your prayer. - My prayer? - Yes, your prayer last night. The one where you had wished that you'd never become a believer. - What are you talking about? - Your prayer's been answered, Daniel. Today you're a man of the world. - Who are you? - My name is Muriel. I've been sent to tell you that your life is now as if you've never been saved, as if you've never received the Lord into your life. - Look, what's going on here? Did Ricky put you up to this? - You complained that your friends were having all the fun. Now's your chance to see what you've been missing. - Yeah, well, I do feel like I have a lot of restrictions on me. (horn honking) - Your new friends are here to pick you up. (horn honking) Better hurry, Daniel, your friends aren't known for their patience. - Yo, Danny boy, man, let's go. - Hurry up, man, we need to get there. - Come on, what are you doing? Come on! - What's going on here? - [Randy] What are you looking at? - [Doug] Who are you talking to? Come on! - Your friends can't see me, Daniel. And they're about to leave you. (engine revving) - [Doug] It's party time tonight, huh? - Yeah, man, we got enough booze to fill Lake Michigan. - Hi, Mrs. Moore. - Hey, babe, why don't you come to Randy's party tonight? We got a six pack of Geritol for you. (laughing) - Delinquents. - All right, remember, we're cutting fifth period early so we can go to the lake, all right? We're gonna meet right here at the jeep. - Yeah, I'll be waiting for you right here, man. - All right. Yo, man, do you think those girls will show? - What girls? - (scoffing) What girls. - The ones we met last night. - Oh. - What's wrong with you, man, you sleep too long? - Well if they don't they're either too stupid or not worth it. (thudding) - Hey, Vicky. Going to Randy's party tonight? - That one, what a dud. - Oh, what's the matter? Mommy won't let you out on a school night? - No, no, no, no, she's gotta get her rest for this weekend. Hey, what you got coming up, babe, a big church hayride? (laughing) - Hi, Vicky. - How come you didn't call me? - Tamara. - Bye, lover. Stud boy. - What time are you picking me up tonight? - Picking you up? - For Randy's party. - Randy's party. - Don't tell me you're not taking me. - No, no, I'll pick you up around 7:30? - Make it 7:00. Bye. - I thought we were only friends. (upbeat music) - Hey, man. - Hey. - Hey, Mike, you seen Ricky? - What do you mean? - Do you know where Ricky is? - Come on, man, you know. - Know what? - He's in the hospital. - Hospital, for what? - You saw Bull bust him up yesterday after school. - Bull? - Yeah, he nearly killed him 'cause he thought Ricky was messing with Melanie. - What? - Why am I telling you this for, you were there. Man, they should have put Bull in jail instead of just suspending him for two weeks. (chiming) - All right, listen, we only got a couple of minutes, so let's get this thing going. What, what's this? - Pardon, Mr. Burgess? - What's this? - It's our class. - But we're supposed to be having our FCA meeting here right now. - FCA? - The Fellowship of Christian Athletes. We're having a prayer meeting here for the film after school tomorrow. - Well as you can see, this is Home Economics. - But it's supposed to be FCA. - You have three seconds to get out of here, Mr. Burgess. - But Mrs. Meyer-- - One-- - Would you-- - Two-- - All right, I'm going. (students laughing) (chiming) - There is no FCA. - You again. - You see, Daniel, you weren't here to start it, so there is no FCA. - What are you talking about? We just had a meeting in-- - It's like your friend, Ricky. You didn't try to calm Bull down in class yesterday when he was jealous, because you're not sensitive to those things anymore. So yesterday after school, Bull beat Ricky up. - Look, uh-- - Muriel. - Muriel, level with me, what's going on here? - I already told you, Daniel. The Heavenly Father answered your prayer last night. Today your life is as if you'd never become a believer. - This is crazy. Look, Ricky and those guys are up to something. Come on, tell me what's going on-- - [Mr. Callahan] What are you doing out of class, Mr. Burgess? - Mr. Callahan, I was just talking-- - Let's go, Mr. Burgess, let's get to class. Let's go. Troublemaker. - What did the guys say about me. I want to know what they're saying. I want to hear every detail. (students chatting) He's so sexy. (students chatting) - Has he called you yet? - No. (students chatting) (chiming) - Hey, Danny, Danny, wait up! - Melanie. - Talk to me for a minute. - I'd like to, but I'm gonna be late for class. - Oh, well just for a minute. - What's wrong? - Come over tonight. - What? - I really need to see you. - Uh, I can't do that, what about Bull? - Forget Bull, my folks will be gone. - I'm gonna be late for class, Melanie. - Please, Danny. - I gotta go. - Call me. - Miss Porter. Gamund. Turnbull. Howard. Llewellyn. Burgess. And how do you explain four perfect scores from you characters? - We studied. (snickering) - Don't press your luck, Turnbull. - What a crank. I wonder where Milner is. - Milner? - Yeah, Mr. Milner? - He doesn't work here anymore. - What, Milner's gone? - Danny boy, man, you smoke some bad weed this morning? We drove him crazy, he left over three months ago. - Huh? Listen, I don't know about this. - Danny, come on, come on. - I said I don't know about this. - Come on, man, just relax. - Let's grab a burger, man. - All right, you're buying. (arguing) Whoo! I don't know how you do it, man. - Do what? - Keep Tamara and Melanie going at the same time without either of them finding out. - Yeah. - Huh? - It must be all in the wrist, huh? - All in the wrist. - Well you don't want to get too bogged down, otherwise we couldn't pick up any babes at the lake. - That's right. You never know who you're gonna meet at the lake. - Yeah. - What'll you have, fellas? - Mr. Milner. - What'll you have? - Don't you remember me? - What do you mean? Yeah, I remember ya. And it was all you guys who messed with my car. If I could have proved it I'd put you all behind bars where you belong. - You got the wrong guy, Mr. Milner. I'd never mess with your car. - But then you're all the same, aren't ya? A bunch of spoiled kids who's only understanding of life comes from watching music videos. Hey, wait on these no-goods for me, will ya? - But Mr. Milner. - What's wrong with music videos? (engine rumbling) - [Doug] Take it easy, Daniel. - All right, see ya. - All right, we'll see you later, all right? Don't be late, okay? - [Randy] Say hi to your mother. - You guys are so bad. (birds twittering) (engine rumbling) - [Dan] Mom. - Thanks for letting me use your car. Here are your keys. - Mom-- - Oh, there's some chicken for you in the fridge. I'm having dinner with Wes. - With Wes? - Don't act surprised, I told you he'd asked me out again. - Well where's Dad? - In Los Angeles, where do you think? - And what about Jenny? - Who? - Your daughter, my sister. - Daniel, I'm in a hurry, see you later. - Mom? - Have fun tonight at your party. (car door closing) Bye. (engine rumbling) - Nice car. - What? - This can't be my car. I could never afford a thing like this. - You bet the football games pretty well last year. - I've never gambled in my life. - Your life is different now, Daniel. - Hey, what's up with my Mom. And where's my Dad, and Jenny? - Your folks have been divorced for several years. You see, it was your prayers that held your folks together when they were going through the tough times. Since you weren't there to pray for them, they split up. As for Jenny, she was never born. - Look, I'm not believing any of this stuff. - You had a big influence with Mr. Milner, too. He really liked you. Many days you were his only bright spot. Then he got frustrated with the other students and left. Too bad, because he was one of the best teachers. - Look, I'm not buying any of this angel bit, okay? But I kind of like the way some things are going. I mean, for a change everybody doesn't just see me as a nice guy. I mean, I'm respected, I'm popular, Tamara's crazy about me, and I like it. - No, Daniel, you've got that all wrong. (telephone ringing) - Yeah? Well, we'll see, excuse me. (telephone ringing) Hello? - [Tamara] 7:00, I'll be waiting. - Tamara? (dial tone ringing) (telephone clattering) (door closing) Look, like I said before, I'm not believing any of this stuff, and I know that somebody's up to something. (keys jangling) (lively music) (kids chatting) - Danny. - How long have you guys been partying? - I don't know. - What's up, guys? - Hey, Doug. - What's going on, what have you got, the silk? Hey, where you been, man? - Hey, the lady kept me waiting. - I did not! - Hey, let the festivities begin. - All right. - Party, sir? No, sir, we're not having a party. No, it's just the stereo's a little loud. - Hey, Randy, what's up, man. - Hold on a second, let me turn it down. (door opening and closing) There, how's that? - Hey. - Hey! (kids talking and laughing) - Hey, watch out! (laughing) (kids chatting) - You got that right. - Melanie. - Randy. - Where's Bull? - I broke up with that loser. - Wait, remember the time when Danny boy stole the battery out of Miss Stoke's car? That was a classic. - That'll teach her to give me a bad grade, huh? (everyone laughing) - Here, let me get you another, babe. - Thanks. - Danny. (kids talking) - Remember those girls at the lake? We can call them-- - Hey, handsome. - Melanie. - I was waiting by my princess phone for you to call and got anxious. I knew you'd be here. - I just dropped in for a minute. - Here you go, hon. Melanie. - Tamara. - Where's Bull? - I broke up with him. - Oh, I didn't know that, that's too bad. - That's all right, Danny knows, that's all that matters. - (laughing) What's that supposed to mean? - Come on, Tamara, you know you lost him. - Why don't you go back to Bull, Mel. That's about as good as you're gonna get. - Listen, you better start to face the fact that Danny's mine and you're out. - Now just a minute-- - Listen, Mel, I don't want you to come near him again. You got that? - Well I can't stop doing that, Tamara, because I'm pregnant. - What? - I'm pregnant with Danny's baby, and we're going to be married. - No, no, no. - You liar! - You two-timer after everything we've been through. - Tamara, wait! Keep the party going, will ya? Talk, talk, talk. Melanie, what are you talking about? You can't be pregnant, not with my kid. - I'm not pregnant. I just said that to get Tamara off our case. - You just announced to everybody that you were pregnant with my kid. - I don't care. I'd do anything to keep you, Danny, I told you that. - I can't believe you just told everybody that you were pregnant! - You don't want me after all you promised me? - I haven't promised you anything. - What? - I said I haven't promised you anything. - I hate you. - Danny, Danny, they're not worth it. But did you really get her pregnant? - What? - Then it's not worth it. - Tamara! - They're not worth it, Danny. Hey. Weren't you on the cover of Glamour magazine? (door opening and closing) - Tamara? - Leave me alone. - Look, Melanie's not pregnant. She just made that up. - I can't believe you were two-timing me right behind my back. - I wasn't. - I'll never be able to live this down. Everybody's probably in there saying how stupid Tamara is. - Melanie was lying, I've never been out with her. - I mean, you were two-timing me right under my nose. - Tamara, it's a lie, I've never been out with her. Listen, you're the only one that I care about. - The only person you care about, Dan Burgess, is yourself. - Tamara, listen to me, we-- - I am not gonna let you run me over. - Tamara, please-- - I don't care if you are the man to be around, the one to know, I don't care who you are. - Is that the only reason why you went out with me? - Oh, Dan Burgess, always the guy to be around. - I said, is that the only reason why you went out with me? - Well I sure didn't go out with you because you're a nice guy. (door opening and closing) - Yeah, I know. - But, Bull, Danny's the one who told me that you were seeing other girls. Now I see he was just wanting me and you to break up so he could use me. (door opening and closing) - Don't worry about it, buddy. Women are like buses, one comes along every 10 minutes. - How did I get into this mess? - Oh, come on, dump these losers, all right? Remember those chicks want to meet us at the lake tomorrow. - I gotta pray. - What? - I said I gotta pray. - (laughing) Yeah, I guess I'd be praying, too, if I knew I had a little papoose to support in a few months. - Melanie's not pregnant, she made that up. - Look, great, then your troubles are over. - Burgess, you got nothing to worry about. - Well what am I supposed to do about the girls? - Dump them, I told you. Look, the chicks at the lake make them look like sixth graders. - I'm not used to being in situations like this. - Oh, come on, stop worrying about it, all right? Let's have a brew. - Let's stop talking about women. - Yeah, like Randy said, they're like buses, okay? And hey, at least buses are sometimes dependable. Listen, if there's one thing I've learned about chicks, you can't trust them. I mean, you can't take them too seriously. - Say, Dan needs a brew, man. Why don't you get him brew, all right? - One chick I might be taking more seriously if I were you is that Sheila chick. - Oh, Sheila. - God, she is so fine, and she digs you, too. She totally digs you. She's crazy about you. - [Randy] Did you see the way she was looking at him. - Guys, I was supposed to meet Scotty Parks after school today, I'll be right back. - Scotty Parks? (engine rumbling) (car doors opening and closing) - Let's go. - Hey, Lucy. - Hey, Dan. - Um, listen, tell your brother I'm sorry I missed our appointment today. I forgot all about it. Hey, what'd I say? - You're a real scum. - [Dan] Why, what did I do? - That was Scott's sister. - Yeah, I know, I was supposed to meet Scotty after school today. - You're on drugs, this is a pretty low joke. - What's going on here? - You know where Scotty is, you jerk. - What's the idea of calling me a jerk? Listen, what's going on? Where is he? - In his grave. You know he committed suicide three months ago. Why are you doing this? (dramatic music) - Suicide? - Hey, Dan, how are we doing, man? (dramatic music) (door opening and closing) - Beggars can't be choosers. - Wait, wait a minute, were you-- - Guys, guys, listen, where's Scotty? Where's Scotty, Scotty Parks? - What are you talking about? - Where is he at? - Burgess! - Bull, no. - Say your prayers. - Come on. - No, Bull, no, no! - Go on, get out of here. (dramatic music) - You guys go that way, I'll get out front. (dramatic music) (thudding) - Oh, come on, get out of the way. - Keep following, we'll cut him off. (car doors opening and closing) (engine revving) (kids yelling) - Run, Danny! (dramatic music) (brakes screeching) - Come on, open up, open up! Help me out, Muriel, Muriel! No, don't kill me, don't kill me, Bull, please. I didn't touch her, I didn't touch her. Bull, please, I didn't get her pregnant. Please don't touch me. - Burgess, what are you talking about? Will you calm down. - [Dan] Don't kill me, don't kill me. - Calm down. I was driving by and see you banging on the church door. Have you gone nuts? What's your problem? (chiming) (panting) You're acting pretty crazy here. - Uh, I'm okay, I'm okay, Bull. - Listen, Burgess, don't you start losing it. You're the only guy who's got it together around here. - I won't, I won't, I promise. - You need a lift? - Uh, no, my, my car's around the back. - [Bull] Okay, see you, Burgess. - I'll see you, Bull. - Hey, I still want to talk with you sometime. - Sure, anytime. - I'll call ya. - Okay, see you. (car door opening and closing) (engine revving) - Still wish you were a non-believer? - Muriel, you really are an angel. Hey, what about Scotty Parks? He's okay, isn't he? And my mom and dad are together, and Jenny's still alive? - Yes, Daniel, everything is now back to the way it was. - (sighing) That's a relief. I mean, I, I, I thought it was one big joke, you know? - That was a very unwise request you made, Daniel, wishing you were a non-believer. The Heavenly Father answered your prayer last night, and gave you one day to show you how your life would be without him. - Yeah, I know, it was stupid. - I'm well aware of the struggle you're going through, Daniel. Satan is trying to lure you, to get you off course. You think that Doug and his friends are having all the fun, and you're missing out. But your dad is right when he tells you that all you're missing out on is sin. Sin is fun for a season, but sin injures people, hurts you and grieves the Lord. Would you have wanted your son to go to that party tonight? - Well, no. - Then why would you go? We must lead by example. - Yeah, I know. - I know you have an attraction for Tamara, Daniel, but the Lord holds relationships most sacred. And it grieves Him when His children take them so liberally. The purpose of a relationship is to find a lifelong companion, Daniel. Someone to marry. Let me ask you, are you ready to be married? - Well not yet, I mean, I want to go to college first, you know, and maybe get a job, and-- - Then you're not ready for the relationship. The truth is, is that you'd like to spend some time with Tamara because you desire some physical pleasure from her. - Man, it's like you're seeing right through me. - The Lord does, Daniel. Let me ask you, if a girl you'd like to marry, how many other men would you like her to be intimate with before you marry her? - Well, no one. - Then go and do likewise. Wouldn't it be great, Daniel, to spend your life with a person who was untouched by anyone else. - Yeah, that'd be great. - This is what the Lord has intended. You see, the Lord's not trying to restrict your pleasure, Daniel, but rather He's trying to maximize it. There's nothing wrong with building relationships, just save all the physical intimacy for your wife. The Lord's ways will bring you full joy, Daniel. - I understand. - The Lord knows your desires and what you need. Wait on Him, He'll take care of you when you're ready. Instead, continue reaching out to people for Jesus. This is what's most important. - But I want to reach people for the Lord, I really do, Muriel, but I'm not affecting anyone for Jesus. They just see me as this nice guy, that's all. - Daniel, Daniel, but you are affecting people. Take a second glance. Look at all the athletes you're influencing through the FCA program. The Lord is really using that. And Ricky and your Christian friends, they really look up to you. And people like Bull need you. He's never heard the good news about salvation. You'll be his first chance next week. And even Mr. Milner knows you have something he doesn't. He's really watching you. I already told you how your prayers kept your parents together. And Scotty Parks? Well if it wasn't for you, I think you know where he might be right now. Oh, and even Doug is being influenced by you. - Doug? All he does is mock us and the Lord. - On the outside and to keep his image. But you didn't know that Doug was reading his Bible every night in his room. He's starting to search for answers, and it's because of you, Daniel. - I don't believe it. I would have never known. - You have no idea how the Lord wants to use you, Daniel. The only way He can is when you're living for Him. You can trust the Lord, Daniel. - I know I can, and I want Him to use me, too. - The only person that will stop you will be yourself. - I know. - Time is short, Daniel. Jesus is coming back soon. Continue reaching out to people. The lake of fire is real, and many people you know are heading there. In your school, even in your church. And very few truly have that personal relationship with the Lord, Daniel, and the laborers are even fewer. - This has been quite a day. - Oh, and you're not suspended from school, either. Mr. Milner figured out what happened. There's a message waiting for you when you get home. - Thanks, Muriel. Thanks for showing me the truth. - Goodbye, Daniel. - Goodbye. Oh, Muriel, will I see you again? (uplifting music) (birds twittering) (playful music) (alarm blaring) (gasping) Jenny! Jenny? Mom, you look great, good to see you. Dad, how's it going, how's the job going? Jenny. (smooching) - Ew, gross, ew. (peaceful music) Hey, Mrs. Moore. - Hi, Dan. - Great day, huh? (peaceful music) All right, listen, we've gotta get as many people as we can to the film today. I really think the Lord's gonna do something. - What's gotten into you, man? You seem all pumped up. Things must be going better with Tamara. - Nah, things are better with Jesus. - [Tamara] Hey, Dan, sorry I came at you yesterday in Milner's class, I found out what happened. - Oh, that's okay, Tamara. I haven't thought another thing about it. - Missed you at Randy's party last night. We had a lot of fun. - Nah, not my kind of fun. - Hey, Burgess, missed Randy's party last night. It was a great time. - Oh, it's a good thing you didn't come, though. We partied way past your bedtime. - Hey, you guys, come to FCA this afternoon. We're showing a really good film. - Oh, no, we stopped watching cartoons long ago. - Come on, I really want you to come. - We don't have time for your stupid films. - I guarantee you'll like it. - Look, I said we don't watch cartoons anymore. I'm out of here. Come on, man. - [Dan] Hey, Doug, it'll really make you think. - Burgess, I got better things to do with my time. - Come on, Doug, look, I know we don't see eye to eye on everything, but just do me this one favor one time. Come on, give the film a chance. - Man, I said I ain't got the time. - Make the time. It's got the answers, man. (dramatic music) - Okay. All right, but if I don't like it, I'm walking right out. - All right. I'll have a free ticket for you at the door. 3:30. (peaceful music) Hi, Vicky. - Hi, Dan. - How's it going? - It's going okay. - Boy, the Lord's really been showing me some good stuff lately. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - I'd like to tell you about it sometime. - I think I'd like to hear it. - Can I call you? - Yeah, okay. - See ya. - See ya. - Yes. (peaceful music) - Scotty. Scotty, Scotty. Scotty, Scotty, you're okay, you're okay, man. It is good to see you. - We're still meeting today, aren't we? - Absolutely, I wouldn't miss it. - I've got a ton of questions for you. - The Bible's got the answers, man. All right, I'll see you later. Hey, Scotty? Jesus, man. (uplifting music)
