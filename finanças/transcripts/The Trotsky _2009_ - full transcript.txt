- Caroline, will you please tell Mr. Berkhoff that the next time I'll be speaking with him will be at the school board meeting in the presence of the Student Union legal team. - You won't be allowed into the meeting, Leon. Administration only. - Well, we'll see about that. And that amounts to a threat, does it not, saying that they won't let it happen? - OK, OK. When is this meeting gonna take place? - Tomorrow afternoon. Thank you. - At the school board? With the commissioner there? - Yes. And one other teensy little thing. Uh, technically, we are not allowed to be there. So we're crashing the party, in the grand Bolshevik tradition of crashing everything. - I presumed you've alerted the media. - Yeah, of course. Uh, and I figured since you used to be married to Commissioner Archambault- Speaking of which, I saw the pictures from that wedding. - Hey. Leon. - How drunk was Maggie Trudeau? - Leon. - What? - I'm not a prop. - What do you mean? - I won't show up any time you want me just to lend you some credibility. - I don't need credibility. - You don't need a lawyer either. - Leon. - I'm here on business, I promise you. - What business? - Uh, legal stuff. Tomorrow afternoon, there's a school board meeting. - I can't. - Why not? - Because I can't! I'm not your lawyer. - OK, fine, let's just... ...put our love aside for a moment and deal with the cause, OK? - "Our love," Leon? "Our love" is something you made up in your head, OK? I don't love you. And, seriously, you should think long and hard about whether or not you love me, because I don't think you do. - Aw! You are a coward. - Oh, fuck you, Leon! I'm allowed to feel used when someone is using me. - You think I'm using you? - Of course I do! You are! - I had no idea you had such a poor opinion of me. - Oh, my god! Enough with the broken-hearted puppy-dog routine. You just feel things because you think you're supposed to. You've never had a real emotion in your life. You need to grow up. - Aw! God, I hate that fucking dream! - Students. - Press corps! See you guys after our meeting. It shouldn't be more than... 10. How's tricks? - You're wasting your time, Mr. Bronstein. - Uh, funny. I feel like I'm wasting yours. So, uh, see you guys inside? Lovely. Lovely ensemble. - I notice there's some new faces here. - Uh, Denise... They bullied their way into this meeting. - Oh, and how exactly were you bullied, Harry? Were you swarmed? Let's get this over with so we can get into the real business of this meeting. Let me guess. Monsieur Bronstein will speak on behalf of this group? - Uh, yes. That's right, Denise. I assume you already know why we're here. I have in my hand more than 578 signatures of students from my high school who wish to unionize. - And I wonder how you got those signatures, Monsieur Bronstein. By pretending it was for installing a Jacuzzi in the hallway? - I see that I'm encountering that legendary school board wit that I've heard so much about. Uh, in that case, I'll just get down to business. Uh, we're here because Henry Berkhoff and his... demonic concubine, Davis... - You won't get anywhere with insolence, Monsieur Bronstein. - Thus, we have come before you... ...oh great and powerful Oz, uh, in search of understanding andlor benevolence. What say you? - Insolence again, Monsieur Bronstein. You know, perhaps you are not the best spokesperson for your cause. En tout cas... What a fucking surprise. - Excuse me? - This is a formality, Madame. A mere formality. Did you honestly think that any of us believed that you would actually take us seriously? You and your, uh, junta school board are more predictable than a Congolese dictator. Uh, no, we-we are only here to give the impression that we were willing to talk sensibly before raining down a hellfire of shit on your legacy! - Monsieur Bronstein! I spent today as I spend most days... working for the Stephen Lewis Foundation trying to convince pharmaceutical companies to donate AIDS drugs to Botswana. So you'll excuse me if I have low tolerance for your histrionics. - I'm sincerely sorry that our little cause isn't dramatic enough for you. Let's go, gang. Downstairs, we have a press conference awaiting us. - Un instant, s'il te pla?t, Monsieur Bronstein. I can only assume you're planning a strike of some kind. But I must warn you, this is not your daddy's factory; this is the government. Do you know what happens to government workers who strike illegally? They go to jail. - What you seem to forget, Madame, is that we are not government employees, we are not your employees. We are students. Just like those students in that square in China. And my name is Mr. Trotsky. Leon Trotsky. Adieu. - Here we go. - I'll do the wrap later. - What was that? 'cause I don't want to go to jail. - Yeah, I'm not too crazy about that idea either. I mean, detentions suck and all, but I bet getting gang-raped by prison guards sucks harder. - Nobody's going to jail! They're just trying to, uh, distract us. Sarah, I think it's time for the sympathy strike. - I've already been laying down the foundations. - You have? - Yeah. - Wow. - All right, I'm gonna deal with the press. Afternoon, press corps. We're calling for a school-board-wide strike of all students 30 a. m., Eastern standard time. Tomorrow morning, students, walk out of class. Walk into the streets and we will show them that we are alive, we are awake, we are aware. Uh, Leon, why exactly are you doing this strike? - We are striking over self-determination. How's that? Believe it or not, yes, our educational environment is important to us. So once again, students, 30 a. m. tomorrow morning, let this strike commence. - Idle threats orjust the beginning, we'll find out- - Leon, maybe you'd like to share with the family how you're adapting to your new public school? No? Come on! Nothing, uh, interesting, nothing provocative happened, nothing worthy of your attention? Today, for instance? - You are so fucking busted, dipshit. - One son at a time. - Sarah, will you please remind your father that I'm not speaking with him. - Leon says- - Oh, of course! Because of this historical record here. Your Leon stopped talking to his father at exactly your age. Isn't that right? Is it? Just nod your head vaguely in my direction. did Leon Trotsky make his whole family the laughing stock of the city? - It's half the city. The French don't care. - You live in the West Island! - Actually, Dollard. - Just so that I know what to expect between us, Leon, you mind telling me what chapters I can skip, so I can get to the relevant parts? 'Cause most of this is incredibly boring! - David! - Stop reading that book. - Why? I'm finding out so much about both of you. - Well, it's too late! You can't wake up one morning and decide now to take an interest in my life! Goddamn it! I'm not supposed to be talking with you! - Oh, poor baby! - I asked you not to talk about this. - Dad, he's totally out of control. - Eli! - What? He's my brother. I can say what I want. Leon, are you OK? Come and have dessert, honey. - Come on, Toronto. Don't let me down. Hello? Is this Mr. Ulianov? Is this Mr. Vladimir Ulianov? It's ei- It's either your name or it isn't, sir. It's a simple question. Fantastic. How-how old are you, sir? I understand why you think it's none of my business, but humour me? You're 73. That's, uh... Your children should come to visit you more often. OK, OK... Yeah? Hello, ma'am. Uh, I'm looking for Vladimir Ulianov. That's you. Hello? Is your name Vladimir Ulianov? No? Thank you! Thanks for nothing. - Yes? The eagle has landed. - Thank you. - Can't believe he wants us to leave. - Are you gonna do it? - Yeah, probably... So are you gonna walk out at 11:30? Yeah. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Oof! - Not for you, it isn't. - OK. All right, how much trouble do you think we'll get in for doing this? - Dwight! - What? I have a right to know. - You're not going to get in trouble. I've already taken the fall. Listen. Have we gotten the word out? Does everybody know? Is this going to happen? - Everybody is talking about it, so everybody knows. The only thing I'm worried about is that no one will want to be the first person to walk out. - I know but they'll hear us in the hallways. That'll put some hair on their balls. We're gonna be fine. - I don't like this. - Then please leave. - Yeah, that's great idea. What if I do leave? What if I go straight to Berkhoff's office, let him know what all you guys are planning? Smart ass! - I held a press conference. I'm pretty sure he knows. - You're stupid, Dwight. - Fuck it! That's it, you stupid- - Hey! Whoa! - Seriously! - You seem fairly calm, Henry. - I am. - How? - What do you think is going to happen when they get outside? - What do you mean? - Well, what do you think about kids these days, Jeanne? Are they bored or apathetic? - Well, I don't know. - Well, I think I do. And I don't think it's what Leon expects. - David. Phone. - Ooh! Hello? Oh, hi, Laura. No, I just thought it was somebody else. No! My god! Why would you even think I'd think it was Leon? You're so- Aw! - Alexandra does this really annoying thing where she moves things with her feet. I think it's from being a ballerina as a child. A cup of coffee is meant to be held with a hand. Ah! They're doing a little shuffling with the curriculum I hear. Some of the teachers are gonna be downsized... - Hmm! - OK, let's go! Let's move it. Let's clear the exit! School progress! Let's go! Let's go! This way. This way. - Leon! Leon! Stop for a second. - No! Mustn't cease the momentum. - Leon! Stop! Stop! - What? - Stop! - Hey, hold up! - Hold up! - What is this, recess? This is supposed to be a fucking revolution! - I know American Idol totally used to be about talent. Now, it's all about who has the best voice. It's bull shit. - Man, what the fuck are you saying? I do too shave my pubes! - No, no, dude. Listen to me. I need herbal Oxy cotton! I'm allergic to chemicals. - Well, OK. We'll keep texting about it, but I don't feel like talking. Thank you. - Excuse me. - I'm gonna do a new one. Bottled up slipstreams And old broken moonbeams They won't see us through till the dawn Shh! And you call in the lights in the royal blue night And you ask me to tell you what's wrong Well crowned kings some days Run 6 ways from Sundays You got your Sunday vest on And you'll fix it You'll find it This time you'll mind it But baby I'm already gone... - It's all over. I'm not it. I'm not the man for the job. Both my heart and my cause lie broken and bleeding on a basketball diamond in Montreal West. - In English, please. - Aw, don't talk to me like that! - No, don't talk to me like that! I don't want the press release. - Oh, uh, right, right. Uh, I forgot, this is all an act. I- I-I can't feel things. I- I-I don't feel anything, so I guess this doesn't bother me at all. - No. That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. - Alexandra... I, uh, I don't trust you anymore. I don't trust you anymore. - ... can't find it And baby we're already gone Fuck. And I'm black and I'm blue But I'm still made up of you And there'sjust no place left alone But I go face the grey Be better some day And baby I'm already gone Thank you. - What? - I think I'm in love. - You are? - Apparently. - Ah! Hey, Alex! All?! ?a va? Mmm! Mmm! - Oui! You look beautiful. - Oh, thank you. You too. - I brought champagne to Thanksgiving. Is that weird? - There's never a bad time for champagne. - That's what I thought. - Uh, Alex? Listen, um, you've got a bunch of ex-boyfriends or something in the kitchen. - Oh... OK. - Just-just wanted to let you know. - Yes, thank you. - I'll take that. They take any more money out of History department, there won't be one left. That's not what I heard. I heard Russian studies is gone. You find that funny? - No, it's perfect. It's a perfect thing to, uh, give thanks for.. - Hey, you. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey! I thought I'd put this in the fridge. - Sure. - Hey, Alex. You, uh, you look great. - Thanks, Julian. Hi! - Hi, Alex. You-you look great. - How've you been? - I have to go to the washroom. - Don't worry, guys. It's slightly more embarrassing for me than it is for you, so... bottom's up. - Hey! - We already did that. - OK. Uh, I haven't heard from you in a few weeks. - I haven't heard from you in a few weeks either. - How you been? - Not great, but whatever. - OK. We should, um, have coffee or something... - Oh, please stop. Please stop this. - OK. I was just trying to- - I know-I know what you're trying to do. Uh, I would rather not talk to you at all than talk like this. - OK, fine. - All right. - Yeah. - Oh no, it's just that history is so important that- - Oh shit, Julian, if you really feel that way, you ought to be doing something about it. Like Leon here. - Yes, good call, Francis. I'll be his shining example of utter ineffectiveness. - It was not ineffective! Reason it didn't work, is because you didn't teach the kids how to strike properly. You don't learn it through osmosis. You know what I mean? - You don't. - Listen, when I organized my first be-in against the war, a lot was expected of us at Berkeley, baby. That was ground zero. - You went to Berkeley? - Berkeley in those days was ground zero. - Ooh! Can you spell "clich?"? - Right in the middle of the Kennedy administration, so the kids weren't used to those massive demonstrations. - You are so old! Wow, I didn't realize that... Old man! - Shut up, Julian! - You are an old- You are a geez- a geezer. - Okay, that's enough. I think it's time for bed... What do you say, Julian? - OK, OK. I'm gonna go, guys. I'm gonna- Gotta be up tomorrow. - Au revoir. - OK. - I got the chair. - Please continue. - Huh? - Your Berkeley-Kennedy demonstrators. Please continue. This was, um, before Patty Hearst and, uh, the DNC in Chicago, It was before all that stuff. Every time I would try to pull a demonstration together, it was, uh, just a disaster. Unless we had some fascist on the campus that we could yell at, it would turn into some gigantic sock hop. I'll explain that to you later. I'll tell you what that means. But the point is, everybody came just to be part of the scene, you know, just to- just to be in the club. And then, one day I realized, it's never real until it stops being fun. All of these people, everyone one of them has to be as serious as you are about it. Not that it's realistic that anybody would ever be as serious as you are about anything. That was a little joke, Leon. "jokitations". Leon? Leon? - All right. Here's the deal. We fucked that strike up. - It wasn't that bad. - It wasn't awesome. - Well, we're moving on. But before we do, you all need to ask yourselves one question: How far are you willing to go? - All the way. - Yeah. - Well, good. Faith without deeds is dead. The time has come for a coup. Everyone follow? - Fuckin' A! - Remind me what a coup is again. - I can't go any further without saying this: We are changing territories here. We are going from the defensibly legal, to the indefensibly illegal. - Uh, what? - We could go to jail. For real. That being said, Skip and Sarah, I need you guys at the movie theatre on Friday. You need a solid alibi hiding in plain sight. Meanwhile, when you're in the theatre, start texting your friends. You start texting your friends. Get them to text their friends. Send out the word that there's something happening at school. - I don't know. Texting in the theatre? - That's just not cool. Why can't I really help? I'm already in so much trouble with dad. What's the worst that can happen now? - I heard the word "jail" again. Um, why don't I just take Sarah to the movies? - No. No, you will not. Skip will. This is the biggest favour you can do me right now. - Well, um, Sarah, I heard there's a new Zack Efron movie coming up this weekend? - And I think there's, um, there's a new Ken Loach retrospective at the Cin?math?que. - Either way. - Who were those kids in the Animal Farm outfits at the dance? - Oh, I know one of them. Her name is M?lanie. - Uh, her name is actually Marie-Soleil. - Mmm. I've told you, I know every French person's name. - Bring me those heads. So you're ready to go to the movies? - Oh my god! Stop yelling. Yes, let's go. OK. Sorry. Yeah Come Go go go go go go go Let's go Fire Bundle up My whole style is so cold I glow like old guys who go bald My flow got no front in the vocal Your flow got no button its so old I don't mean to sound like a showboat But it's true my persona's nojoke I stepped into some kind of portal I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble I'm from the most risky zone oh No place is more shifty global More pistols Russian revolvers We shootin'all that is normal But it ain't just because we want to We ain't got nowhere we can run to Somebody please press the undo They only teach us the things that guns do They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets - See me go over the counter? - Hello? You real But my real is tenfold My rhythm make yours a rental Gangsta if at ease essential... - What in God's name is going on here? - This, my friend, is a coup d'?tat. They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets All we got is life on the streets Come... - OK, we're good. - Mr. Bronstein, I know it's you in that pig mask. - It's time for you guys to get the hell out of here. - What do you mean? - Well, there's nobody left. We-we-we've secured the office. There's no other reason for you to stick around - You have any idea how long it took me to figure out how to barricade these doors? - You sure you don't need us? - No, I'm-I'm positive. No, what I need you guys to do is go find Skip and Sarah and spread the word, OK? I- I need a really big crowd out front and quick. We really need that crowd. - Understood, comrade. - Yeah, man. - Spasibo. All?, police? Excuse me, but I've forgotten how to say " hostage negotiation" in French. Ah, d'accord. Merci beaucoup. I actually just got off the phone with the cops just this second. They're on their way down now. I told them that I wasn't armed technically, but that I could still do lots of damage. - Stop talking to the cops! - I thought it was cool. - Don't say anything else till I get there. - I'm re-enlisting. Do I have a cell phone? - Hey, uh, it's Leon. Um, I've taken my principal hostage so I'll probably be on the news soon. So, if you miss me at all you can see me there. And I still love you. That's it. Goodbye. - Hey, uh, it's Leon. Um, I've taken my principal hostage so I'll probably be on the news soon. No cops yet. I guess people don't actually care what happens to you. - What exactly do you hope to accomplish today, Mr. Bronstein? Because the almost certain outcome of this is you going to prison. - Yeah, I think that was pretty obvious by now. - Why are you deliberately sabotaging your own life? - Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me. I am not sabotaging my own life. How dare you? And if I was, it would be for the sake of my ideals. - Oh, please! Your ideals? You want to better the existence of your fellow man? - Yes! Yes! That's exactly it! - Let me tell you what I learned after teaching public school. They don't want your help. They don't want it better. They want the same shit. If they didn't, this wouldn't be hard for you. - You wanna know what's hard? What's hard for people like me is the very existence of people like you! - You make me sad, Mr. Bronstein. A revolutionary sans a revolution. You're a real Russian tragedy. - No, you are. You-you are that doctor in Uncle Vanya. Ineffectual and middle aged. My troops will mobilize, just you wait. They will shed the thick cloak of boredom that you have forced them into. They will don their coats of arms and the-the tunic of oppression that you wear will choke you, sir. - You couldn't have mixed that metaphor anymore. - I make my point! - Bronstein... Bronstein... Isn't that the kid from the factory this summer? Yeah, the hunger strike kid. And now, he's taken his principal hostage. Serious shit disturber. I thought he was fucked up, but... He's significantly more fucked up than I thought. Ah! - Hmm. - Yes. Pigs is here. - Crowds yet? Any wild gangs of rebellious youth? No? What a shame. Maybe they don't hate me as much as you think they do. Hmm? - OK, look. We have to mobilize, guys. OK, it's crucial that we physically support this cause. - Yawn. Am I right? - Shut up. - But why? We already physically walked out of school. - Yeah. - That kid kind of scares me. - What the fuck is he doing anyway, holding Berkhoff hostage? Shit, that's serious! - Yeah. Why not Davis? - What'll Leon do after this revolution? He'll redistribute homework so we all have equal amounts? - Can we have a student secret-police force? - I wanna be the young Putin! Right? - Ha, ha, ha. OK, look. You guys are gonna have to take this a little more seriously. - What the fuck is there to take seriously about this? I mean, ha, ha and everything, but where's the potatoes? - Sorry, what the fuck? - What's the substance to Leon's argument? - Yeah, I completely agree. - OK, look, I'm not like his spokesperson or whatever... - Oh, thank God for that! - Um... The schools suck. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yes. - Obviously. - No, I mean, seriously, the schools suck. - Duh! - Yes. - Right, right. Um, should it suck? I mean, seriously, guys, should school suck? - No. - No. No, right? - So, if we all agree that school sucks and that it shouldn't, then what's next, guys? Hmm? - This is turning out to be a great speech. - That's where Leon's coming from. 'Cause he's the one- He thinks... that what's next is us getting involved. Because are we? Are we involved? I'm not. Fuck no! I mean, I'm the fucking treasurer of the Student Union. I got you that job, man. - SHUT UP! - So fine, right? Whatever. There's no judgement. but I mean, for real, we don't do shit to make that school better. So Leon thinks that by forming this union, that it'll force us to kind of all get involved and we will make things better. OK, he thinks that things have a better chance of improving if we improve them ourselves. - I mean, that's dead fucking on. - Yeah. - Exactly! Exactly! That's the best possible explanation! - Wait though. Tony, do you- do you think Leon's right? - Of course, he is. - No. - OK, Dwight, I wanna know what Tony thinks. - I don't know. I have no fucking idea. But, um, you know who doesn't believe in this union? Uh, you know who thinks, like, our opinions mean less than nothing? Fucking Berkhoff. You know, I'll-I'll figure out what I believe later. 'cause right now, all I want is for that asshole to be wrong. And that's the only reason I need to follow Leon. I'll put my deeds before my faith for the time being. - I don't even think- - Shut the fuck up, Dwight! Burn. - Hey! That was fucking awesome! - Yeah, I guess we'll see. - No, seriously, Tony, it was. - Yeah, still gay. - Aw, fuck! I'm sorry. I'm just super caught up in this shit right now, you know? - Glad you liked Land and Freedom. - Totally. It's like my new favourite movie. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hey! Skip! Sarah! - What happened? Why aren't you guys with Leon? - He wanted us to leave. We've been rabble-rousing, trying to spread the word. How's the crowd coming? my thumbs hurt. I'll tell you more on the way. Let's go. - They need your demands. These cops are getting bored. They're gonna bust in there and arrest you. OK. OK, I'll tell the chief. OK, this is what he wants. He wants the school board commissioner to, uh, allow the kids to unionize. And safe passage to Venezuela. That was a joke, the Venezuela. He, uh, he wants the commissioner brought down here. That's all. - Fine. I want you to know that we're humouring him. - Humouring me? Could we please just get Archambault down here as quick as possible so we can all go home? Thank you. Awesome. - Ah-ha! - This isn't over! - Oh, I think we both know that it pretty much is. - Mom! What are you doing? - Get in the car, kids. - No, Ma. We're going to the school for Leon. And no, not even just for Leon. This is something that we all believe in. I won't come home with you! I'm sorry if I let you down. - Stop being so shrieky! I'll drive you. - You will? - Yeah, come on! Come in! Hurry! - Oh, great. I don't- Do you guys want a ride? - Can you all fit in? - Mm-hmm. - Are you OK? Put your seatbelts on. Your father wanted to come too, but he had a meeting with the Moroccans. - What's that? Put the seatbelt on. - Mum! Drive the car. - Oh, come on! - Madame, uh- - Madam Chairman... - Madame... - Ma'am I should really explain the circumstances... - I watch the news I know exactly what's going on here. But thank you very much. Leon Bronstein Please come to the window. Give me a hand. - Uh, welcome. - I am thoroughly unimpressed and unamused, Monsieur Bronstein. Now, perhaps this is your idea of playful hi jinks, but in my books and in the books of the gentlemen in uniform here, this is an egregious and punishable offence. - Well, maybe now you'll see that we're actually serious. - Who is the "we", Monsieur Bronstein? You and God? Are you the king of England? All I see is one brilliant young man, desperate for attention, and clearly willing to go all the way to get it. - Yeah, OK. We want a union! - Listen, Norma Rae, we've already had that discussion, and it's not gonna happen. So let your principal go. - We want a union. - You don't deserve a union! You're children. You do what we'll tell you to do. And on behalf of all adults, grow up, Monsieur Bronstein. - Madame Archambault! Do you want him to be an adult or not? - Did I not just make myself clear? - No, you didn't. It seems like a very adult thing to do, fighting for your rights. - Well, no one asked for your opinion. - I, uh, agree with her. - There's a surprise. Run out of clients, Frank? Had to start scouting the high schools? And this is the best you could find? Leon Bronstein, the shining beacon of hope for the great revolution? - I think he may well be, yeah. - How profoundly disappointing. - Good god, Denise, you're so mean! - Why don't you tell your crazy, little friend to let us all go home? OK, Frank? - Let me ask you one real question first. - Shoot. - What kind of people you think it takes to change the world? I know it's all very amusing for those of us in the post-postmodern here, this notion of revolution. But what kind of people do you think it takes to really pull this thing off? Do you think they ever change? No! They're always the wrong men for the job. They're always the ones other people think are crazy. - Do I really have to listen to this? - Do I think Leon Bronstein is the right man for the job? You bet your ass, Denise, because he's doing it and you're not. - Bravo. - Can I park here? - Yeah, you can park here. - OK. - Uh, what's that? - What's what? - Holy fuck! - By the way, Denise, that shining beacon of hope found me. And I'm damn grateful he did. - We want a union! We want a union! - We heard you, Monsieur Bronstein. - Guess this is the "we" you were talking about, Denise. - We want a union! We want a union! - We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! - I'm his lawyer I go where he goes. Boredom! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! - Well, of course we're gonna appeal, but we're very happy the way things turned out. - Yeah, uh, this is a message to the youth of Canada- uh, nay, to the youth of the world, uh, that they may be able to wound us, but we will never be silenced. We will always be heard! The revolution lives on! Vive la revolution! - All charges against Leon Bronstein have been dropped. The court released him on one condition.: he is never allowed to attend school in the province of Qu?bec, ever again. - Well, if you need anything, money or food, just call me. I'll send you whatever you need. - Thank you. - OK. And, uh, don't worry about Ontario. You know, they're not only Alice Munro and Maple Leaf fans. There are fun people there too.
