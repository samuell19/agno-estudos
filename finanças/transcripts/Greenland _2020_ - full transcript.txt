Hey, boss. What are you still doing here, man? - I thought you were taking off early. - Yeah, well, I'm trying to. Why hasn't the concrete pour started yet? The first truck blew a hose in the alley. They're fixing it now. It's always something, huh? Why don't you just take off, man? We got this. No, no. I know you do, but I gotta sign the invoice. Just sign it now. I'll hold on to it until we're finished. All right. Thanks, Bobby. But you still call me when it's done, okay? - You got it, boss. - All right. ...stack of papers here with headlines, but I can promise you, the only thing people wanna talk about today is this Clarke, this interstellar comet. You know, they are saying this'll be the closest comet flyby in history, which means we're gonna be able to see this thing even in bright daylight. - It's amazing. - Yeah. They only discovered this thing a few weeks ago. NASA's saying it appeared out of nowhere from a different solar system. This is just... - You scared me. I didn't hear you. - Sorry. - What time is it? I thought we said 7:00. - Uh... Um... I finished work early. - I can hang downstairs if you want. - That's okay. I'm done. How many miles? - Five. - Five. Good. Is the party still on for tomorrow? Are you kidding? Nathan's invited half the block already. How's he doing? He's okay. How long is this gonna be awkward for? I don't know, John. It's not like I'm trying to make it that way. 'Cause if you're just doing this for Nathan, - I'm not. I'm not. - I... I don't... I'm not. All right. I'm just... just checking. It's just gonna take some time... and some effort from the both of us. We can do this, Ali. All right, I'm gonna go shower. I'll call Deb, and I'll tell him to come home. - Will you make sure he washes his hands? - Yeah. Thanks. Hey. - Dad! - Hey. - I'm glad you're home. - Me too. Are you still liking this drafting table, kiddo? Yeah, I can draw really good on it. Yeah, I see that. Wow. I like this one. Come here. God, you're really a great artist, bud. - Thank you. - Yeah. - So, how's school? - Good. Yeah? Your teachers talking about this thing? Yeah. Mr. Williams said Clarke is like a big snowball, but made of gas. Wow. Asteroids are made of farts. Okay. I got it. No. Clarke is a comet, silly, not an asteroid. Oh, a comet. I didn't know there was a difference. Comets move faster, like, way, way faster. Did you know that Clarke was from a different solar system? Which is why they don't know much about it. Ah. Well, now I know two things. What? That you and comets are made of farts. - No, you are. - No, you are! No, you are! No, you are! Come here. How's this thing working out? - Is it better than the shots? - Way better. Yeah? Good. What's the matter, buddy? Is Mom gonna make you leave again? Your mom and I, we got some things to work out. But no matter what... Look at me, son. I'm always gonna be your father, all right? I'm never gonna leave you. I love you, kiddo. Scientists continue to study Clarke, the interstellar comet discovered only weeks ago. Unlike most comets or even asteroids, which move much slower and are easier to track, this particular comet is not a singular body, but made up of hundreds of pieces of rock and ice that have broken up over millions of years. In fact, Clarke's fragment trail is so long, the end stretches beyond what astronomers can actually see. In other news, Wall Street's... Nathan, come on. Homework. The Dow Jones closed down over 2.5% today. Can you help me? - All right, what do we got? - Fractions. - I thought you were good at math. - I don't like fractions. They're hard. Well, it's okay for it to be hard, because fractions and math are important. You think your dad can build skyscrapers without being good at math? - You wanna build skyscrapers like me? - Yeah. Come on. I'll give you a hand. All right. So, which figures are divided into equal parts? Guest room it is. - Cool binos, bud. - I don't see Clarke. Maybe he's still sleeping. Dad. ...developments overnight. Some of Clarke's larger fragments are now expected to enter our atmosphere. According to scientists, when the largest fragments get closer to the sun, they heat up and they expel jets of gas, changing their trajectory. Yes, but they're also saying not to worry, that these things won't hit the ground. They're gonna burn up as they pass through our atmosphere. But I bet you, it's gonna make one heck of a show. Hey, John! Welcome back, amigo! - Hey, Ed. How you doing? - Good. - How are things? - Good. - Still coming over later? - You know I'd never miss a free meal. Oh, I know that. See you in a bit. Hey. We're gonna need some more beer and wine. Can you go to the store for me? People are gonna be here in an hour. - Now? I'm just about to start the grill. - Well, I need to get ready. People are gonna be here soon. Okay. Okay. You need anything else while I'm there? Just so I know. No. All right. Actually, get some more hot-dog buns. And, um, some mustard. We only have the spicy kind. Thanks. All right, kiddo. Can I get a toy? If you listen and hurry. Whoa. Where are they going? I don't know. Look! There's Clarke! Whoa. Looks pretty cool, huh? All right, let's hurry up. Hey, Nathan, come on. All right. Some Bud Light... Can we get juice boxes, too? All right. Okay. Juices. - Which one do you want? - Oh! I like those ones. Okay. So then, those ones. That's loud, Dad. What is it? Must be an AMBER Alert. "Presidential Alert"? Hello? This is a Presidential Alert. It is not a test. John Allan Garrity, you have been selected for emergency shelter relocation with Allison Rose Garrity, Nathan Beckett Garrity. You are allowed one personal bag. There are no exceptions. Please have Allison Rose Garrity... ...Nathan Beckett Garrity standing by for more information. This is not a test. All right. Nathan, come on. We gotta go. - But you said I can get a toy. - We'll get one next time. Come on. That's right. It's a rewarding experience. - There they are. - About time, man. Sit over here. Hi. Hi. Hey. John. Good to see you again, man. You too, Kenny. Hey, Deb. Hey, buddy. ...as it heads toward the Atlantic... You're just in time. One of the first chunks is about to hit. - Clarke is gonna hit? - Only part of it. Don't worry, it's going into the ocean. Dad, come and sit with me! Yeah, I just gotta go talk to your mom for a second. Hey. - Where's the beer and wine? - In the car. Listen, I just got one of those Presidential Alerts. Did you get one? No. It's probably just a test. Can you get the stuff? No, Ali. I don't think it's a test. They said our family's been selected for shelter. I think something weird is going on with this comet. But the news said the fragment thing is falling somewhere near Bermuda. Then why is half of our military on the move with a ton of planes in the sky? Hey, John, here it comes. You guys, get in here. Now, splashdown off the coast of Bermuda is expected in just a few seconds. A number of scientists say the dispersive wave distance, it's unlikely to cause a tsunami... Did you take a unit for the popcorn? Do it. ...but it will give us the largest impact since the Tunguska event of 1908. That's when a meteor slammed into... - Look! There's Clarke! - Looks pretty cool, huh? Spectacular first images here. - Would you look at that? - These are coming to us live. This is the fragment actually entering the lower atmosphere. - Five, four... - Five, four... - ...three, two... - ...three, two... - ...one. - ...one. And impact. Wait, where's the explosion? It's a chunk of rock. Rocks don't explode. Tell that to the dinosaurs. We are still waiting for the first images of the actual splashdown that's expected in the Atlantic Ocean. - What was that? - The earlier footage showed... Nathan! Come here. Everybody okay? - What was that? - You guys okay? I think it was a shock wave or... We now are getting word that the fragment, it has hit the state of Florida, central Florida, with the impact's epicenter reported just outside Tampa stretching to Orlando. And that fragment, which scientists are estimating was the size of a football stadium, has apparently sent a shock wave felt as far as 1,500 miles. Uh, I have to warn you, there are no words for what you are about to see. These are disturbing, disturbing images. They are coming to us from a local news helicopter in Tampa as well as an overhead weather satellite. - Whoa. - What? Mike. Mike, turn back! Mike, turn... Oh, my God. Wait, are some more pieces gonna hit? Bear with us here. We don't have much more information than these images. Unfortunately, we have lost contact with our affiliate in that area. What is it, John? It's a Presidential Alert. The estimates of the trajectory were obviously way off and we are... Why did your phone get it and not ours? This alert is for John Allan Garrity. You have been selected for emergency shelter relocation... Dad, your name is on TV. ...with Allison Rose Garrity, Nathan Beckett Garrity. No one else is allowed with you. There are no exceptions. Bring one personal bag to Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Georgia, at 9:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Your QR code for identification has been texted to you. Please confirm you are receiving it by pressing one. Maybe we got the same message on the TV at home. But why did only John's phone get it? Present the QR code at Robins Air Force Base for flight clearance by 21:45 hours. Another one's gonna hit us. I know it. Let's go. Let's go, Ellie. I wanna stay with Nathan. - Move, Ellie. Go. - Mommy. Let's go take a walk. Let's just take a walk. Unfortunately, we don't have any more information than these images that you are seeing. We have lost contact with... They said one bag each, but I don't even know what I'm packing for. Hot, cold? I don't know. Hot, cold. Both, I guess. - Where's his insulin supplies? - Cabinet, top-left corner. Remember to get the cartridges from the fridge. - Is this gonna be enough for a month? - A month? A month, a year. We gotta be prepared, Ali! Oh, sweetie. Hey. Hey, look at me. Everything's fine. We're rushing 'cause we don't wanna miss that plane. Okay? We're all gonna take this trip, but we're all gonna be together. All right, kiddo? What about Grandpa? Hey. We're gonna call him from the road, all right? ...aftermath of the Tampa impact. Tampa is a city of... Oh, my God. ...just under 400,000 people. That's everything from upstairs. Hey, you almost ready? We've got a long drive. Give me the bag for the insulin. - The bag, the bag, the bag. - Yeah, okay. - Where's Nathan? - I thought he was with you. The degree of devastation is indescribable. Nathan! Nathan! Nathan. Come on. Let's go. Look, the sky is on fire. All right, let's go, kiddo. Come on. Okay, we're good? Yeah. We can see it from here? John, John, John! Oh, God. None of them got called. Two days. They got it all wrong. There's a shit-ton of fragments on that thing. They're saying that one of them is a planet killer. Now they've grounded all non-military flights. What do we do? I don't know, Ed. Come on. I don't even know if this shelter relocation thing is real. That's bullshit! And you know it! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. It's just... Just please give us a call if you find out anything when you get there. Like where we can go to be safe. You know I will, Ed. Good luck. Good luck. Wait. Wait! Wait! Stop! Oh, God. Stop! Wait! - Wait! - John, stop. Wait! You can take Ellie! Please! Please! We can't take her, Deb. You can take Ellie! Please! - Maybe we should. - No, Ali, we can't take her. - Ellie! - Deb, I'm sorry. We can't take her. I am begging you! Deb, for Christ's sake, get out of the way! - John. - Ali. No! We can't take... - No! Coward! - Deb, I'm sorry! - No! - John. - Allison. Allison. - Ellie! - Please, open the door! - Ellie! I'm sorry, Deb! No! What if it were Nathan? What if it were... Nathan! Ellie! No! I'm sorry, Kenny. No. No! Wait! John, we gotta go back! Ali, we can't take her. - But why? - What? So we take her to the air base, and then leave her standing there alone when they turn her away? He's gonna call. He's gonna call us. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. While more impacts are expected around the globe as the Earth spins on its axis... Stupid call won't go through. I hope my dad's okay. ...bombarded with millions of calls, leaving already desperate people with indefinite hold times. All over the country, people are buying out grocery stores, stocking up on supplies. That didn't take long. There are unsubstantiated reports of some citizens receiving Presidential Alerts with instructions to report to military bases around the country, having been selected for transport to classified emergency shelters. - Does that say where they're taking us? - No. All it says is the shelter locations are classified. There's no information. I don't get why we were selected. There have still been no official statements from the White House or Homeland Security. What is going on? Many speculate they've been withholding information to avoid causing mass hysteria so that they may relocate those selected for shelter first before the inevitable collapse of our nation. Oh, no. Great. Look at the highway. My God. Careful. Wait, what are you doing? Going another way. Be careful. - Damn it, John! - Sorry, Ali. Okay. Okay. All right. I think we're good. Clarke's fragments, now estimated to be in the thousands, continue to impact different regions around the globe with little to no warning at all. While many of them are smaller in size, causing minimal damage, some fragments are large enough to take out entire cities, like Bogotá, Colombia, just minutes ago. - But what has space agencies concerned... - Finally. ...as they try to gather more data is one fragment now identified large enough to cause an extinction-level event. This particular fragment is estimated to impact Earth within 48 hours. Jesus. Local law-enforcement agencies and first responders are overwhelmed... Do you think all these people were selected? Dunno. What if there's not enough room for everybody? Let's just get in there first. - Jump. Okay. - All right, guys, we gotta go. But you hate planes. All right, kiddo. I know. But sometimes you just gotta suck it up. Push through, right? Even when you're super scared. Can you do that with me, bud? Yeah? All right, we gotta go. All right? Let's go. Only selectees will gain entrance. Get your QR codes ready! If you were not selected, do not approach the gate. Stay back! Only selectees will gain entrance. If you were not selected, do not approach the gate. Are they letting people in? It's okay, kiddo. If you were not selected, do not approach the gate. We were selected! We were sele... Oh, shit! Did another one hit? Hey, we were selected! Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Coming through. Excuse me. Let's go! - Keep going. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - We were selected. - Selectees only. Hey. We were selected! I need your ID and bar code. There. Hangar 33 for in-processing. Go now. All right. Take my arm. Let's go. Sorry. Group Charlie 4, go to transport 56. - Keep moving! - Let's go, guys. Have your IDs and your bar codes ready. Your wristband is your personal identification. Do not remove it. - Thank you. - You will not be able to board without it. Come on. Let's go. Keep the line moving. That's yours. - All right. This arm here. - Can you help him? - There you go. - Thank you. Okay. Um... guys? Put the discarded items by the wall! Take your personal belongings and put them into this one bag. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go. No exceptions. Take your personal belongings and put them into this one bag. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go. No exceptions. Put the discarded items by the wall. Take your personal belongings and put them into this one bag. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go. No exceptions. Sorry, one bag? We have three bags. One per family. Keep moving. - Keep moving. - Okay. All right. - Sorry, guys. - One bag per family. Let's go. ...personal belongings and put them into this one bag. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go. No exceptions. All right. Let's just pack as much as we can in. Okay. Um... Grab some pants, shirts for everybody. Yeah, yeah. I'll put Nathan's stuff in the backpack to keep it separate. Okay. I got your blanket, okay? We'll put it in here. - Put his pants in there. - Make room for... That's a shirt for me. - John? - Yeah. Where is his medicine? I put it in here. It's gone. What do you mean, it's gone? - It's gone. It's not in there. - It's in there. You put it... Nathan, did you go in your backpack? I wanted my blanket. Oh, God. He must've dropped it in the car. Shit! What now? What do we do? Hang on. Please, please, please. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. How long till our plane leaves? Fifteen minutes. Twenty, tops. Okay. Okay. - I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go get it. - Wait, what? What, are we just gonna leave his insulin? - I have the wristband. - John. Look, I'll meet you on the plane. Just text me which one you're on. - Keep moving. - It's okay. He'll be right back. Okay? We're gonna put this in here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. No, I need to grab something from the car. I have my wristband. Can I get back in? Yeah, go ahead. Go. Okay. All right. Uh... You know what? Come here. Come here. Hey! Excuse me. Look, I know my husband just talked to you. He's going back to the car to get my son's meds. - Can you make sure he gets on our plane... - Meds? Yeah. It's just his insulin. Sergeant Ruiz? What's the problem? What's up? It's okay. I just explained to him. It's just for his insulin pump. It's not a big deal. You know what? Forget it. It's fine. We don't need it. That's not the issue, ma'am. Don't worry about it. We'll use the shots. It's not a big deal. - Line one, we need an escort. - What? Look, we have the bracelets. We were selected. Follow me, please, ma'am. No, no, no. Why? Ma'am, I'm not asking. Let's go. It's okay. - Come on. Hurry up! - Over here! No, Captain, I don't remember giving the order on that. No, tell me something, how is there a problem with that manifest? I signed for it myself. Then I will come down there and check it. I'll be down there in five. - The kid's diabetic. - Don't touch him. I'm sorry. You should've been informed. Anyone with a chronic condition can't be on the plane. It's just diabetes. His condition should've been flagged at screening. If I hadn't said anything to the guard, he'd have no idea he had a pump. There's nothing I can do about that, ma'am. You can pretend that you didn't see it. - Ma'am, I didn't write the rule. Sorry. - Then ignore it! What if this was your family? My family wasn't selected, ma'am. 99% of armed forces weren't. We are all volunteers here just doing our jobs. I'm sorry. I am. But please... His father, my husband, is on one of those planes right now. What am I supposed to do? Hey! This is Breen. Yeah, I'm looking for a passenger. Ma'am, what's his name? John Allan Garrity. John Allan Garrity. Chalk 33? Yeah, his son was flagged. Thank you. They're looking for him. Thank you. Thank you. Allison! Nathan! Allison! Do not run. Move in an orderly fashion to your designated aircraft. Have you seen a kid? He's age seven. He's wearing a gray hoodie. And his mom is dark-haired. She's about 5'7". I've seen a lot of kids, sir. Please keep moving. I need to know if they made it on first. - Do they have bracelets? - We all have them, yeah. Then they're on one of these planes. Are you sure they're all going to the same place? Yes. Now go. Everyone keep moving in an orderly fashion! Allison! Do not run! Okay. Thank you, Lieutenant. Ma'am, they're boarding. There's nothing more I can do for you. No, no, no. Come on. You can go on one of those planes and look for him. There are dozens of planes with over 2,000 passengers crammed in. - I can't hold them up for this. - Are there phones? Can I call? I don't know if there's any phones. - Where are these planes going? - Shelter destinations are classified. Look, ma'am, this is an emergency operation with a lot of moving parts. I am just in transport. I wish I had more answers for you. Please. What am I supposed to do? - I'm very sorry. - Stop, stop. No, no, no! Ma'am, I need you to step this way, please. Allison! Nathan! Allison! Nathan! Nathan! Allison! Everybody sit down! Let's go, let's go! Everyone sit. Everyone find a seat. Sir, find a seat. We're ready to roll. I'm trying to find my wife and kid. They're on this plane. I need you to sit down. We gotta get wheels up. Everybody find a seat. Sit down, sir! Find a seat. Let's go! Shit. Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey, how'd you get on? What do you mean? I was selected. Yeah, I know. With those. No, it's my son's. He's diabetic. Yeah, so is my sister's kid, and they turned him away. They said no illnesses. Do you know somebody who can help us? Hey! No, wait, wait, wait! No, open that door! - Open that door! No! - Whoa, whoa! What are you doing, sir? Get back in your seat. - Get back in your seat! - You gotta let me out. I've gotta get to my kid, please. I beg you. You get off this plane, we are leaving without you. That's okay. Just let me off the plane! Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Perimeter breach! Perimeter breach! - Ma'am, step this way! Somebody help her! - Perimeter breach! Move, move, move! Security breach! It's okay. Come on. Let's go. Perimeter breach. Perimeter breach. Runway three-three. All security forces to runway three-three. - Go, go! Runway 33! - Maintain the perimeter! Backup to runway 33! Follow me! - Let me on that plane! - Let us on! - Please take us! - Let us on! - Drop your weapons! - Drop your weapons! Drop it! Stay there! Get on the ground! Drop your weapons now! Hey! Everybody get out! There's fuel leaking. It's not safe! Go! Get on the ground! Go, go, go! Is that Dad's plane? No, honey. See, there's other planes. He's not on that one, okay? We'll find him. Come on. Come on. Hold my hand. - Get out! - Hurry! Don't stop! Let's go! Move back! - Hey, sir, don't stop! - Hey, hey, hey. Stop and listen! I need to find my wife and kid. Did they come through here? Sir, I remember you. They declined your son. Your family's not out there. Keep moving back. Move back! Go, go, go. Oh, shit. Careful. Stand over here, away from the glass. Come on! Over here! Are you okay? Let me see. Look at me. Are you low? Empty. Hold on, let me find your meds. Your dad must have them. Okay. Look at me. All right, we've gotta find a pharmacy. Here. Here, take that. If we don't find Daddy, we'll go to Grandpa's house, okay? I'm just gonna send him a message. Stay back! Oh, shit. Allison! Okay, there it is. All right. You've gotta stay really close to me, okay? Get what we need and get out of here as quick as possible. Sorry. Here. Okay. Come on. Kneel down with me. Okay. Give me your finger. You're such a brave guy, you know that? Oh, Jesus. You're at 300. Let's get you fixed up. Okay. Uh... Okay. Come on! Everybody out! Come on! Get out! Get out of here! - Move! Get out! Get out! - Get the hell out! - Everybody out now! Let's go! - Get moving! - Move! - Move, bitch! Get out! Move! We're just gonna go as fast as we can, okay? Just stay low. Stay next to me. Come on, now. Come on, come on, come on. Let's go! Come on! Just grab it all! Come on, keep moving! No, no, no! Oh, my God! No, don't look. Don't look. Oh, my God. Here, stay with me. Stay with me, right next to me. Please! Please. - Please. - Move! My son's only seven years old! Move it, move! Go. Come on! Hey! Hey, hey! Are you going up north? Please, we need a ride. Please. - Are you going up north? - Get in the car. No, no, no! No, we just need to get up near Lexington. Get in the car. I'll take you as far as Knoxville, but that's it. Thank you! Get in, get in, get in! - Come on. Get on in, son. - Okay. - My God. Could you hear gunfire? - Yes. I just started running. I turn around, and there was an old woman who'd been in a wheelchair. - They just killed her. - Oh, Jesus. I watched them. I thought they were gonna shoot me. - I'm sorry, hon. - All right, there you go. - You're okay. Okay? - Okay. - Are you okay back there? - Yes. Thank you so much. It's like there's no chain of command. Nobody in charge. Everybody's running around with their heads cut off. Shit. We'll get to Knoxville, get on a flight. Yeah, if we can get there before they take off. And if they let us through. I mean, that stupid lottery. You know the government knew about all this, and all they did was pick the rich fat cats. Damn. Hey, is your son, uh, is he hungry? - We got a sandwich here. - Oh. You know what? It would be really good for him to eat something. Thank you. We got a turkey sandwich, sweetheart. Does that sound nice? - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. What do we say? What do you say, sweetheart? Thank you. Well, you are welcome, pal. Are you two out here all by yourselves? Uh, no. My husband, um... We got separated. He's on a plane. A plane? Ralph, they're wearing those bracelets that we saw on the news. Y'all got picked? Why aren't you on that plane with him? My son, he has a medical condition, so they wouldn't let us on. Oh, what a shame. That's a damn shame. ♪ That saved A wretch like me ♪ Hey! Hey! No, wait! Wait! Shit. Work, you stupid piece of shit. Finally. - John? - Hey, Ali? Can you hear me? Oh, thank God. Ali, are you okay? John. Did you get my text? Hey, Ali, I can't hear you. - Hello? - Where are you guys? - Are you at your dad's? - John, if you can hear me... - I can't hear you. - ...please meet us at my dad's. - That's where we're headed. - Ali... - Is that Dad? - Yeah, that's him. - Where is he? - I don't know. The phone's not working. - I wanna see him. - I know. We're gonna meet him at Grandpa's. It's okay. He's gonna meet us there. Kiss my ass, Clarke! Come on, guys. Everybody in. We gotta get moving. Hey. Hey! Excuse me. - Where are you headed? - North. - How far? - Canada. Can you take me to Lexington, Kentucky? It's on the way there. Okay, but you gotta get in now. Thank you. Thank you so much. So, what do you do? What? What do I do? They're selecting people based on their professions. Like my mom, she was selected because she's a doctor. I'm a structural engineer. I build buildings. We definitely need those. Hey, I'm John. Colin. Good to meet you. You as well. You as well. So, if your mum got accepted, why are you not with your family? I haven't spoken to my family in seven years. I found out about all this through my sister. Yeah. Me and my mom, we had our issues. So much for holding grudges, right? What about you? I don't like flying. Thought I'd walk. I lost my wife and son at the military base, and I'm trying to meet up with them now. All right, look. So my boy Manny that's driving, he knows some pilots in Canada. That's where we're all headed. They're giving some people rides to the shelters. But the shelters are classified. How do they even know where they're going? They've been tracking the military flights to Greenland. Greenland? You should come with us. Nah, thanks, but I gotta find my wife and family in Kentucky. So find 'em and meet up with us after. We're taking off from Osgoode. It's a small city right across the border. How do you know you're even gonna get in? Only one way to find out, right? You know, it's gonna be tough getting that far north, all the way up to Lexington. I mean, it's crazy out here. Are you sure you don't wanna just come with us? You know, get on a plane? I already tried that. It didn't work, so I just need to get to my dad's. Oh, okay. Ralph, what is it? I just... I can't... I can't believe all them soldiers at the airport, that they would turn that boy away. I mean, with a face like that? She already told you that's what happened. Yeah, well, maybe... maybe if he had some different family with him... What are you doing? Wait. What are you doing? Why are you stopping? Ralph! Look, your husband, he abandoned you. But you don't gotta worry. I'm gonna get your son to safety, I promise you. I'm gonna get him on that plane. - Ralph. Wait. - No. You don't have to... Where are you going? Oh, my God!

What matters is you don't deserve that band. All right, listen. You're gonna give it to me. It wouldn't do you any good. It's got my name on it. It wouldn't work for you. You're gonna give me your license too. I don't want any trouble. Just... Come on. All right, listen. Give me the goddamn band. I'm not giving you the band. Come on, fellas.

Need ride? - Where are you going? - Aeropuerto. Aeropuerto in Knoxville? - Sí, Knoxville. Okay? - Sí. Gracias. This bracelet is broken. It's not gonna go on. Well, find something. Find a rubber band or something. Just figure it out. Don't you worry. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna see your mom again, okay? What did you do? What did I do? I gave us a chance. I gave that boy a chance. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Hold on. Let me get this thing. Just rubber-band it, huh? Now you listen to me. You wanna see your mama again, you do exactly as I tell you. When them soldiers ask you who we are, we are your parents. You understand me? Do you understand me? Just do what he says and it's all gonna be okay. All right. Come on. Let's do this. Selectees only! Bar codes or wristbands! When we get up there, show your bracelet. And you show 'em yours, and you don't say a word. You hear me? - You hear me? Don't say a word. - Just be easy, Ralph. Back up. Back up. Let's go. Let's go. Coming through. We got bracelets. We got bracelets here. Coming through. We got a bracelet here. We've got bracelets here. Coming through. We got bracelets here. Coming through. We've got a bracelet here. We've got bracelets here.

It's okay. Let me see your wristband, bud. Says you've been rejected. You don't look too good, big guy. Are you sick? It's gonna be all right, all right? Don't cry. Come on. Let's go figure this out. What's going on? No sé. Aeropuerto still a long distance. - No, no, no. - I have to go. Excuse me! Coming through! Coming through! Excuse me! Coming through! Excuse me! My son... A man and a woman, they took him. They said something about coming here for a flight. Ma'am, I can't hear you. They took my wristband. You probably scanned it. Nathan Garrity. We've had hundreds of kids through here. Look, maybe try the FEMA camp across the street. Move! Move! You need to fill out this consent form. The soldier at the checkpoint said you might have my son here. - You need to wait in line. - Listen to me! You need to wait in line! - I need to find my son. - We're doing our best. He's seven years old! He was taken from me! Somebody just listen to me! Ma'am. Please. Come here. Talk to me. - What's going on? - I'm trying to find my son. He's seven years old. He's diabetic. He was taken from me. Somebody said he could be over here. I'll help you find your son, but you need to calm down. Follow me. Let's check the pediatric tent. - Where? Where? - Right here. - This one? - Yes. - You see him? - Uh... - No, he's not in there. - Let's try around here. You see him? No, he's not in here. - How about here? - No, he's not here either. It's okay. It's okay. We'll find him. Check this one here. Nathan! Nathan. - Mom! - Oh, honey! Oh, my God. Look at me. Oh, baby. I'm so sorry! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll never let that happen again. I'm so sorry. I'm fine, Mom. He's a remarkable young man. - You're Allison. - Yeah. He's type one diabetic. I've gotta check his levels. He told us. We checked his levels twice. Gave him some insulin, new pump. If I can get you to sign this release form, I can move you guys into a family tent. No, um... we're going to my father's. I lost my... I lost my husband. We're gonna find him. I'm so sorry. Where does your father live? In Lexington. Near Lexington. Okay. Maybe I can get you on a military bus heading in that direction. And I also put together a week's supply of glucose tabs, and insulin, and test strips, so... I wish I could give you more, but it's all we have. Thank you. Hello? Hello? ...see on camera at this moment, but the city is mostly burning... Governments continue to struggle to contain the social chao... ...again, this livestream video that's gone viral. We have to warn you, these images are disturbing. All of downtown is on fire, man. Check it out. There's another one. Wait. Is that coming towards us? Wait. Holy... Yo, run! Yet another shocking image... - Sometimes they come down... - Wow. They come out of nowhere, you know? There's no warning. - We're just trying to keep up. - Yeah. And, uh... having in the back of our head that tomorrow we're... It's all gonna be for nothing. Now it comes. What a load of shit. Looks like I'm gonna have to dip into my savings for this next round. You're alone. Where's Allison? - Where is she? - I was hoping she'd be here. Why are my friends stuck here babysitting me while my daughter and grandson are out there alone, and I'm here with no way to find them? We lost each other at the airfield, and she left me a note to meet her here. Fuck. Maybe we should go. She told me you were moving back in. Let me guess, you had another fight? We both want the same thing, okay, for them to get here safely. So why don't we try to work together? Okay. Okay. Did you try the landline? Go ahead. I tried about an hour ago again. Keeps going straight to voice mail. Or you get that stupid government message. God, you would think technology would work in emergencies. Hey. What happened to you? - Nothing. - Come on. It's been a long day. Just want 'em back. I just... Okay, there's a pay phone there. Let's try that. Yes. Hello? Where? Stay there. Stay right there. - Where are they? - Down the road. Let's go. Hey. I'm sorry, honey. I tried. I tried. I know. It's okay. Kiddo. - How you doing? - Good. Yeah? Here. Come here. How you doing? Okay? Thanks for looking after your mom, bud. Hi, Dad. Hey, sunflower. Oh. Come on, honey. Let's get you guys home. Okay. Come on. All right, welcome. You hungry? What do you wanna eat? - Pancakes. - Pancakes. Syrup? - Yeah! - Yeah! - No. - No. - No. I forgot. - We don't have enough insulin as it is. Aw! - I have his medication here. - You do? Yeah. It was out of the fridge for a long time, but it should still be good. Thank you. You remember where this goes? - What do you want? Some water? - Some water, yeah. Way to go. All right! - This good? - Yep! Perfect. - "Perfectomundo." - We should check the news. What do you think? At approximately 8:47 a.m. Eastern Standard Time tomorrow, the largest fragment from Clarke is expected to land somewhere between North Africa and Europe. Space agencies tracking this fragment are predicting an extinction-level event to extend around the globe, giving the limited number of people chosen by their skill sets the greatest chance of survival. Here again is the classified footage discovered earlier today showing the sophistication of five bunkers near Thule Air Force Base in Greenland. They are in Greenland. Built during the Cold War in case of nuclear fallout... - He was right. - Who was right? ...the bunkers are self-sufficient with underground water tanks... Just this really good guy. ...hydroponic seed farms, medical supplies and oxygen generators. - A lot of good that'll do us now. - The footage is older than me. Who knows what shape it's in? At least here we'll be together. What are you doing, John? There's another way for us to get there. - Where? - To Greenland. There are pilots going from up in Canada. They're taking people. They're not military. Look, it's just over 12 hours to Osgoode. But we can do it in nine. And then it's another six to eight hours for the flight. We can make this. My bracelet. What if they don't let us in? They've already flagged Nathan. Honey, it's our only chance. Now listen. We can either stay here or we can give it a shot. But if we give it a shot, I swear I will get us into those bunkers. But if we're gonna go, we gotta go now. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Let's do it. - All right. Nathan, let's get ready. We left some clothes in the guest room. What about the pancakes? I'll make 'em. Don't worry. They're on their way. Okay, Nathan. Go ahead, take your clothes off. There you go. All right, step in. Shampoo's over there. Grab that. Okay. Go ahead. Wash yourself. Good job. Okay. Hurry up. Hey. You need to pack some clothes, Dale. We barely have enough time as it is. Ah, somebody's gotta stay and watch Beck. Mary'd kill me if I left him. Man, she spent hours in here. Now I can't separate the smell from my memory of her anymore. God. Hay and horse shit. Dale, this isn't some storm you can ride out. Look... I don't fold when things get rough. I know you guys' marriage was on the rocks. Every marriage goes through shit. Every marriage goes through shit. That don't mean you get to jump into another woman's bed. You're right. I did. And I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. I'm not expecting your forgiveness, Dale. But if I get one thing right, I'm gonna get my son and my wife into that bunker. Please come with us. No. Why are you being so stubborn? Just come. You know you'll die here, Dale. Of course I will. Today, tomorrow, 10 years from now, don't make no difference to me. My Mary went to heaven in this place. And when the good Lord's ready for me to join her, I'm gonna be right here in this place too... bags packed. Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Hey. Kiddo, are you hurt? How close do you think that hit? Anything hit you? That was close. All right, we gotta get out of here now. Take my truck. It's got a full tank of gas. Hold on, hold on. Let me get your booster. Up you go. Take care of them. I will. I know you will, son. Bye. When will I ever see you again, Grandpa? Grandpa... Yeah, pretty soon. All this blows over, I'll come up, visit you and the polar bears. Polar bears? Well, yeah. You're going to the North Pole, right? Say hi to Santa for me. Tell him I'm still mad about the coal. I-I love you, sunflower. I love you too, Dad. Mom would have been proud. Of what? You finished the house. Bye. Bye, Grandpa. My friend Teddy says your life flashes in front of your eyes when you die. I think it would be better if it did that while you lived. That way, you could see all the good memories and be happy. I like that idea a lot. Me too. How'd you get to be so smart? World leaders scramble to create makeshift shelters as Clarke's largest fragment, already deemed a planet killer, is on target to hit less than 15 hours from now. Other elected officials are... The number of missing is up to a million after the Tokyo impact earlier today. Jesus. Finally. At least they're going down with the band still playing. That's true. What? Do you remember the first time you met my mom? Oh. She was wearing a kilt! Kilt. How could I forget? She wanted you to feel at home. She did make me feel at home, that's for sure. Remember she had me try to do the Highland fling? Like I know how to do the Highland fling. Ah, she was a good woman, your mum. I heard you talking to my dad in the barn. John. I'm just as much to blame about us. No. No, Ali. No. No matter how bad it got... I crossed a line, and you didn't. Listen. I'm right where I wanna be... with you... and Nathan. Okay. Ah, great. This is... This is the only highway north within 50 miles. Please remain calm and stay in your vehicle. Please remain calm and stay in your vehicle. We're working as fast as possible to clear the highway. - Is the road blocked? - Yeah. It's a crash. What is it? What's going on? A train derailed across the highway. This is an emergency alert. Small molten debris expected to fall in upstate New York... - Isn't that where we are? - Yeah. Seek shelter immediately. Do not stand in the open. Seek shelter immediately. We're getting out of here. Oh, my God! John, go! Come on. Small molten debris... Get down on the floor! They're hitting everywhere! Get in the back! Cover Nathan! I'll try to find shelter! Get down! Get down, come on! Stay down! There's a bridge. Hang on. We've gotta go quick! Come on. Quick, quick, quick. All right? Let's go. Quick, quick, quick! Come on! All right. Come on. All right. Go up under the beams. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come here. Come on! Where are you going? Hey! Hey! John! It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Come on, man! Wake up! Come on! Okay. Let's get you outta here. Come on. - You okay? - Yeah. Let's go. This is Rochester, New York. Everything south of our location is on fire. Anyone out there? Anyone make it? If anyone is listening... "The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky. And they called it Wormwood." My thoughts and prayers are with all of you. We're cutting live to Yuri Leonov, who is about to give NASA's formal statement. Good evening. At approximately 8:47 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, uh, Clarke's largest fragment will land near western Europe... Do we even have enough time? ...triggering a series of events. I don't know. We got just over six hours. Yeah, we can still make it. The nine-mile-wide fragment, larger than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, will destroy most of Europe upon impact, causing seismic events that will generate 1,000-foot-high tsunamis and 900-degree surface winds traveling faster than the speed of sound. Within hours, all of the continents will be on fire, as the impact's molten debris rains down from the upper atmosphere. Like the previous, uh, extinction event, this will kill more than 75% of all plant and animal life on Earth. Turn that thing off. Where the hell is this airport? What is that? Is that it right there? They're taking off! No, there has to be more. Let's go. Hang on, Nathan! - There! There. - Shit. - We're catching this plane. - Are you going on the runway? Hang on! Hang on! - He's turning around! John! - It's okay. - He's coming right at us! - I know what I'm doing. Stop. Stop. Come on, now. Come on, now. Told you. He looks pissed. Wouldn't you be? Hey. What the hell are you doing, man? Listen, my... my wife and my kid, we're trying to get to Greenland. You're going there. We were selected. We're already at capacity. There'll be more planes tomorrow. Or there won't be a tomorrow! Come on! I put everyone in danger if I take you! Then take my wife and son. I can't risk it. Then we're not moving, all right? We're staying there, and you're not going anywhere! Okay, I can take the kid, maybe your wife. No! We all go! You're gonna take all of us! How much do you weigh? Uh, 180, 185. Come on! 205, maybe 210. I'll be driving to Greenland at this point. But get in. No luggage! And move the goddamn truck! - I will. - Thank you! Go, guys. I'll go. Okay, try to find an empty seat. Sorry. Sorry, everybody. I am. Here. We can put the kids on our laps. Make some room for you guys. - Thank you so much. - No problem. Thank you, guys. Thank you so much. Hang on. Okay. You should re-dress that. Looks bad. There's some burn butter in there. Gauze. Peroxide. A few painkillers too. Appreciate it. What do you see? Dad! Whoa, buddy. He's still a little bit hurt. - Sorry. - It's okay. I love you too, kiddo. How are you feeling? Terrible. But we made it. Hey, there it is. I see it! I see land! Look. See it? Yes. Look at the ice. What do you call that? - Glacier! That's the glaciers. - Yeah! Good. - You okay? - Yeah. It's okay. It was just a bump. Okay? Nathan, come here. Get up here with me. It's gonna be okay. Oh, my... Oh, my God! Oil pressure light's on. We're losing power. Dual engine failure. Let's try for a relight. - Power level's flight idle. - Confirmed. - Prop levers, feather. - Confirmed. Going for airspeed. Generators off. - All aircraft. - Confirmed. Clarke's biggest fragment is close to entering the atmosphere. - Condition lever on. - All airspace closed. Land immediately. Try it again. Right engine starter, engage. - Engaged. - Yes! Shit. I still don't have enough lift. Left engine starter, engage. I got nothin'. We're going in hard. Cut the engine. Fuel valve off. I don't wanna fly anymore! No, it's okay, baby. We're on the ground now. Okay. Come on. Let's go. You guys go. Take him. I'll go see the pilot. - Okay. - Sorry. Come on. Jump. All airspace is closed. Land immediately. Clarke's biggest fragment is pinpointed to hit western Europe within minutes. Wherever you are, seek shelter. This is a recorded message. Good luck, everyone. Okay, hang on. Let's get you outta here. All airspace is closed. Land immediately. Go. Go. Look. All airspace is closed. Okay, good. We're at the airport. Clarke's biggest fragment is pinpointed to hit western Europe within minutes. Wherever you are, seek shelter. This is a recorded message. Good luck, everyone. Where are the pilots? Look. It's snowing. That's not snow. That's ash. All right. Listen up, everybody. I saw a military plane land just over here. It's at least a mile away. We gotta go. Come on. Let's go. There! There they are! - Help us! - Hey! Hey! - Look, look! They see us! - Come on. Let's go! The big one's gonna hit any second. Hold on! Come on, come on. I got you. - Take him. - Come on, little guy. I got you. Oh, my God! Okay. Guys, let's go. Go, go. Go on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - Keep moving! - Blast doors closing. Blast doors closing. Blast doors closing. Let's go, let's go! - Go, go, go! - Blast doors closing. Blast doors closing. - Blast doors closing. - Inside! Let's go! Yes, sir. The impact shock wave will reach us in one minute 20. Go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Go, go, go! Move, move, move! Keep moving! Keep moving! - Brace for impact! - Brace for impact! Brace for impact! Where are the flashes? What flashes? Before we die. The flashes. Listen to me, son. It's okay. Your mom and I love you from the bottom of our hearts, okay? We're right here with you. So it doesn't matter what happens, okay? Because we're together. - Okay, you hear me? You hear me? - Yes. And we're always gonna be together. So there's no need to be afraid. We're right here, okay? Thirty seconds. Down. Get down. I love you. You're my life. Fifteen. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... CQ. CQ. This is Greenland station. Is anyone receiving? CQ. CQ. CQ. This is Greenland station. Is anyone receiving? CQ. CQ. CQ. This is Greenland station.
