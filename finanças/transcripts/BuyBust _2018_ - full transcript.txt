Where is Biggie Chen? I told you. He's in Manila. Where exactly? - Don't look at him. - Sir Alvarez! Don't look at him. - Your life is in my hands. - Sir Alvarez! Look at me, you motherfucker! Answer me! Where is Biggie Chen? Dela Cruz. Dela Cruz. You know, we both want this to end. But that will only happen if you help us. I'm sure you're tired of all this, aren't you? Come on. We'll protect you if you help us. He's in Tondo. What did you say? In Tondo. - Tondo? - Yes, sir. In Tondo. Tondo, right? Do you see this? What's this? - That's Tondo, sir. - Yes. Do you know what this color means? Peace? If a district in Tondo is code blue, that means it's already drug-free. I rehabilitated that place myself. You can't fool me. Was that you? So that's why. It was you! What are you implying, you son of a bitch? What? It's just that you look like... you just got out of rehab yourself. It hurts. Sir, it's just... Honestly, sir. Even if you put them in rehab, they will still return to that place you cleaned up. Don't change the topic! Are you going to tell us where Biggie Chen is? Are you? Are you? You don't want to talk? Maybe your wife knows. Number 16 Kalayaan... Culiat. Wait, sir. Can't you take a joke? Of course not. All right, sir. I'll give you Biggie Chen, sir. I'll give him to you. I can't point out where he is, but I know... how to smoke him out of his den. I don't care who you are or where you're from. Show me that you're not lazy, limp dick amateurs like they've all been saying. From now on, we are bonded until death. Rather than being not so bright Rather than being not so bright I'd rather shoot true in a fight My jumbo hotdog tastes just right As long as you're all under my wing, you only breathe when I tell you to, blink when I tell you to, and follow everything I say. So if you want your stay here to last, you better leave your bullshit back where you came from. Because there's no room for dead weight here. No place For losers Get my latrine clean and ready Open mouths wide, keep it steady Here. Elia, take the lead! Hurry! Flying solo, are we, Manigan? I'm sorry, sir. I got distracted. Shut up. Why did you leave your squad? I thought that was the right move... You think? That wasn't your sector! We have a combat SOP! Someone will die because of you. People die from following orders too. What did you say? That's what happens to you if you don't care about the squad. Hey, you're annoying me, get down to your bunk! Your shirt smells so salty! Take a bath! Go take a bath! Let's play some tong-its. JUDAS? How's your back? I know losing your old squad was rough, but that's no excuse to disobey me. I took you in my squad... because no one else wanted to. This is my first chance to be a team leader. I will not waste this. And I hope you too, won't waste the chance I gave you. So before we start everything... They say when a man gets shot, he feels nothing. Because of the adrenaline. The body's last defense before it dies. The body thinks that it's fine, that it's okay, but the truth is... the body's giving everything it can before it dies. From what I've seen, when you get shot, you immediately fall. No adrenaline. If you're dead, you're dead. Be that as it is, but you still haven't answered my question. Yatco! Open your mouth. This is about... one of the bigger fish in illegal narcotics in our country. One of the most elusive... because he quickly moves around, and has ears everywhere, even from people with power before. No one knows about him. That's Biggie Chen. Recently, our operatives discovered a meth lab that's allegedly owned by him. And, we got word that he plans to lie low overseas. So we need to act right away. And this is our insider. There, alias "Teban." He is a mid-level drug dealer. He is our key to capture Chen. So our mission is to lock up Teban? Don't sweat it, Lacson. I already have him. He's now our asset. This is Agent Rudy Dela Cruz. He coordinated the recent clean-up operations in Tondo. And he will be leading the next mission. I'm your man. Congratulations. You finally got promoted. As what Agent Dela Cruz said, Teban is in our custody, and we'll use him to bait Chen. And this operation happens tonight. - Some action already, boss? I'm game! - Calm down. - Hey, I can finally use my... - Calm down, assholes. You immediately murmur when you don't even know the situation yet. The buy will happen... at Rajah Sulayman. Plaza Rajah Sulayman, at 20:00 tonight. We go in, two vans... here. Rabbit enters from the back. Team Bravo, stand by for the bust. Team Alpha, you're on the perimeter. What's our assurance that the target will come? Biggie Chen is a shrewd man. Based on my intel, he personally deals with all big transactions. Remember. We can hear you, and you can hear us. All set. Don't you have anything bigger than this? I've got headphones at home. You want to borrow them? Hey, no more questions? None? Okay, move out. Lacson, don't get too close. You'll get burned. Don't tell me what to do. I know what I'm doing. Yes, I can't tomorrow. Just tell him to move it next week. - Sir? - I don't have any. - Sir? - Go away. - Please, sir. - Go away. - Spare change will do. - I don't have any change. - Go. - Food will do, please. Please, sir? Spare change, please. - I'm hungry. - Please, sir? - Get out of here. - Sir, please, we're starving. Please, sir. Sir, have pity on us. Some spare change will do. - Over there! There's a group of people. - Let's go! Relax. It's just a roving patrol. Recover the asset! Oh, my god. I'm going to get killed. I can't align the asset. I can't see the rabbit. I'm going to die. Recover the asset. Recover him! Don't panic. I can still see you. You're early. Biggie? - Yes, I've been here for a long time. - Sorry, but I'm not coming. What? Why? I've got a bad feeling that you've got company. No way! - Not me. - Then why do you sound nervous? I'm not nervous. Not me. I'm good. When did I ever lie to you, boss? We've done this for a long time. Boss, I'm already here. I have the money, all of it. It's a shame if we don't do this! Where again? Okay. Guys, we're changing location. Seven, follow the rabbit. Check where he is heading. The plan has changed. We're going into Gracia ni Maria. Hand over your gear to them. Team Alpha, we won't move until Agent Dela Cruz says the call sign. "Ecstasy." What about backup, sir? We need to go in quietly. We can't risk alerting Biggie. PNP is our backup, but they're on call. Yes, on call. Got a problem? - Mom. - Yes, dear? - You had dinner yet? - Not yet, I'm still playing. - What? - Not yet, I'm still playing. Talk to your son. He hasn't eaten yet. Just let him be. He won't die. He's a man. What are you talking about? - Man or not, if you don't eat you'll die. - Sir, is this a suicide mission? Do you really trust Agent Dela Cruz's plan? But this is our duty. I know you have something to prove. We're the same. You're not jinxed. What happened to your old squad wasn't your fault. And it's not your fault if anything happens to us. This is your squad now. What's important is the mission. You'll be the last man later. Hey. Are you scared? Why? Aren't you scared? Not anymore. I'm used to it. What is that you're holding? What, this? My bottle cap talisman. As long as I wear this, I'm invincible. Keep calm. Don't get too excited. You don't even know what's in the district of Gracia ni Maria. You know, it's a free-for-all there, where sinners and saints collide. He will save you from peril, from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence. Under his wings, you will find refuge. You are my God, the God in whom I trust. NO SQUATTING HERE Boss Chongki, we're here. Okay, we'll just look for him. Hurry, it's much worse to get drenched! TRIP TO THE ROAD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS Wait here. For real? Here? Is there a problem? - Chongki! - Teban. It's been a long a time, Chongki. That's a big entourage you got there. Just porters, Chongki! Doing big-time operations now, aren't you, Chongki? Hey, boss! Do you have to check there? Don't move. Are you hiding something? No. Of course not. No need. We're carrying. Bring them out, please. Surrender them to Jet. What, are we going to just stare at each other? Bring them out! Hey, what now? What if I refuse? Do you want to die right here, right now? Teban, you know the rules here, right? What is this? - You got a comedian here? - No. Just relax. Come on. - Alda, return. - You'll get them back. Just hand them over. Give me that. Come on, give it to them. It's getting cold. Let's go. Hey! - Hey! - Don't! Who are you? I won't rat you out! Please don't. Hurry, man. This place is like a maze. How much farther? We've already gone left past this red house three times! Teban, who the hell are these you brought along? Aren't we allowed to ask questions? Now, we go right. Hey! Where are you going? We go through the next corner. Be careful. You might get lost. - Hey, brush your teeth before you sleep. - Okay, okay! - So young and you're flirting again? - I wasn't! Come here. That smells good. Is it ready yet? It's almost done. Ma, what's for dinner? Noodles. I'll have the chicken flavor, okay? Sure. Son, can you do me a favor? Can you go buy some soft drinks? Get some money from my wallet. Okay, but can I buy snacks too? You son of a bitch! Where have you been? - From my daily drive. - Daily drive, you reek of booze! You're such a liar! - I'm losing my patience with you! - I'm the one who's losing my patience! Teban! What's with your crew? Fucking slowpokes. Hey, Baldy! Hurry up! Asshole. I'm sorry. Hey, the school's the one who's going to set them straight. They'll teach them about good manners immediately. Because you'll have a hard time now that they're all growing up. Jenny, take your brother now! Hey, can you lend me some money? Why? What happened? It's for my school project. I've spent all my allowance. You've already spent your whole allowance? Yes, there are a lot of things going on at school. Why are you here? - Let me go. - Just come with us. - We'll take you home later! - My mom is already looking for me! Judiel! My child! You go ahead. Cheater. Boss Chongki! Where's boss Biggie? He's upstairs. Call him. Hey, Teban. How are you? Here, still alive. You suddenly disappeared. I heard the cops caught you. No way! They wouldn't dare. I see. Hey, baby! Where are you going? Why are you so itchy to close this deal? The cops are still hot on your area. It's such a waste, boss. This is big money right here. This bag feels light, doesn't it? - Hurry up, I'm next. - Two hundred says we pass, okay? I swear, boss. It's all there. You can count on me. So who are these guys with you? Our new clients' boys. I might beat you up. Have we met before? Stop. We're trying to play here. - I doubt it. No, sir. - Call the backup. - Yes, sir. - I think we have. Your face looks familiar. - Don't you say shit to me! - Asshole. Hurry up! No signal. They've got a signal jammer. Hey! You're too fucking noisy! Don't be fucking rude! Pardon us, boss. It's his fault, he's been asking again and again. What now? Let's go! Put it down. Elia, just try to keep on calling. Asshole! I'll just have a drink here. You're such a hard drinker. Way to go, boss! You're too close! We're not even close! Boss, we'll stay here, okay? Fine! I'm drunk. You two are flirting like crazy. She's a dude! Memeng, check the money. Boss Chongki, it's Cocky. Just a minute, Boss Biggie. Let's pullout, sir. Let's wait until Bravo Team exits. What is it, Chongki? What did Cocky say? We've got to talk, boss. Here it is. That's clean, okay? All right! We'll take it, boss. Aren't you even going to check it? What kind of businessmen are you? No need, boss. I trust you. Are you in a hurry? Just a minute. Why not enjoy the best of Gracia? And let's invite our guests outside while we're at it. You're never leaving this place. Biggie! It's a set-up! Alpha, pullout! Son of a bitch! There are cops! There are cops! Go back! Now! It's blocked! Backtrack! Thanks, Judas. You delivered as always. Did you hear that? Come on! Let's go! Go back! Hizon! - Get him! - Get him! Hizon! Hizon! You son of a bitch! Boys! Girls! Listen up! Listen as I end your friend's life! Listen up! Remember, his blood is on your hands, not mine! Listen up! Santos! So... listen carefully. Here's our deal. If you surrender, none of you will get hurt. You know, I sympathize with you. I know you're simply doing your jobs. However... What is that? Who's that? Hey! You! - Come here. - Stay put. - Come here! - Elmer! - He's too old, sir. - Chongki, just leave him to me. - Come here. Turn off your alarm! - Elmer, don't go there. Boss Chongki! Put it on silent. Chongki. You stubborn piece of shit! You son of a bitch! Hey! Let's do it this way. I'll count to five. -If you surrender, -Please don't. this old man gets to live. - Please don't. - Sir Chongki. If not, I'm sorry. Listen up! One. Two. You've already left your teammate for dead. Are you leaving this man, too? Three. Four. Have mercy, sir. I'm sorry, old man. My hands are clean here. - Have mercy, sir. - Please help us! Chongki! Chongki, no! Who's there? Boss, it's us. What happened? They're gone, boss. Find them. Okay, boss. My condolences. Elmer! Elmer! Son of a bitch! What happened? We're always caught in the crossfire. Damn it, Judiel hasn't even been buried yet! It's going to be a long night. Let's go! Let's box them in! Let's stay put. Sir, we need to leave. We need a plan. Wait! How can we get out of here? Bravo Team needs us. Yatco, they're dead. We're not yet sure. He's right. You know, we can't get out without backup. We were set up. It's too dangerous for us to stay within Gracia. We can't leave Bravo Team behind. - Yatco! - Silent! We're leaving. We don't know if backup's even going to arrive. Let's find a way out, okay? Eat lead! Shoot them! Elia! The other side! Surround them! Surround them! - Surround them! - PDEA assholes! Kill them all, morons! Assholes! Hey! You son of a bitch! You're dead now! Make it quick! Hurry up! Motherfucker. Santos! Calm down! Don't be trigger-happy! Let's go! Manigan! Elia! Santos! Yatco! Don't! Santos! Santos. Come on! I'm still okay. Alpha Team, let's get out of here! Who are these people? - What about Santos? - Manigan! - We can't leave Santos! - Manigan! Manigan! Fuck, don't be stubborn! Come on! Gelo! Hurry up! Rico, come on! Manigan! Get inside. Judas. Dela Cruz! Thank God you're still alive. What happened? You heard about it, right? And Bravo Team? Everybody scampered. We got separated. You weren't hit? Luckily, just my lapel. You are lucky. Do you have an extra gun? Sorry. And we're almost out of ammo. Let's go back to the building. We can get more ammo there. Guns and ammo. And I need to find my team, too. Wait. It's too dangerous. We need to call for backup. I already called them. They'll be here soon. That's good. Come on! We can't stay here for long! Let's go there! On your feet. - I'm okay. I wasn't shot. - What happened? I just smeared her blood on me. - You're not hit? - No, I'm fine. - You set us up! - Hey! You motherfucker. What set up are you talking about? - I'm not that smart! - Manigan, what are you doing? It wasn't Teban who set us up. Who, me? Fuck you, Manigan! You made sure we had no backup. He already called, didn't he? Without a signal? So it was you! You set us up just like what you did to my old squad! Are you still blaming me for that? Manigan. Put your gun down. Admit it. You are Judas! He sure is! I am not going to let my own team get butchered! You weren't shot! - So what? - While your squad's riddled with bullets? - Do you work for Biggie now? - Do you believe this? Is that why you brought us here? I bet. What? Is that your motive? Son of a bitch! I'll have you all arrested, you want that? Dela Cruz! Admit it! No! I want to capture Biggie. Elia, Lacson. Upstairs. Manigan. Yes, cuff him. You're really cuffing me? He's the criminal! Who's the Judas now? Elia, check it out. I know we don't get along but this isn't right. Sir. They're coming. So? Let's go! Manigan. They're inside! You animals! You have no shame! Yatco! Your legs are in the way! Yatco! Run! Hurry up! Let's go! Manigan! - Climb up! - Yes, boss. Hey, you! Go back! Go there! - Hurry up! - Just a minute! I need momentum! Faster! - They're up there! - The other side! - Quick! Hurry! - Don't let them get away! Hey! Here come these fuckers again! People are trying to sleep here, you sons of bitches! You're all dead now! The community is coming, you bullies! You shameless people! Look there. - Get off our roof! - Get off! Go back for Elia! Yatco, Manigan! Lacson! Look for an exit! - Get down here! - How can I? - Like this! - Fuck! Easy, right? You son of a bitch! Kill him! Get out of there! Finish him off! Finish him off! Kill him! You son of a bitch! Manigan, come on! What about Elia? You son of a bitch! You bitch! You fucking animal! You bitch! You motherfucker! Annoying bitch! Manigan? Yatco? No response. Fuck! I hope the authorities respond to the noise. You wish. - We're out of ammo, Yatco. - Lacson? Lacson? Sir? No response. We're the police. We need assistance! Let us in! You think we want to get involved with you assholes? What did Jet and his crew say? They still haven't found them yet, I don't know. We need to call for backup. Get out of here! Don't involve us! It's not that we don't want to help, but we can't do anything. Get inside. We need to call for a police response. Here. I can let you use it, but in situations like this, I'm sure there's no signal. How can we get out? If I help you, what about us? I'm sorry. Berns. What now? You won't get too far in that shape. Why not make a decision? That's the team leader's job. Berns! Berns! There. We go that way. That way? Up there? What are you talking about? Teban, make sure you guard our hostage, boy. Just trust me, come on. Fuck you. I'm my own master now, you son of a bitch! You fucking pussy. Here come the demons! They're here! - They're here! - You bastards! - You beasts! - You sons of bitches! - You killed our husbands! - You assholes! My son was innocent! Leave us alone! We just want to get out. - You're shameless! - You're shameless! You bring nothing but trouble for us! We're minding our own business here. We want to prosper! Right! - Hey, Baldy! - Animals! - Sons of bitches! - You won't leave! Just let us go! Just like that? What about us? - You animals! - You ruined our families! Get ready. It's going to be a free-for-all. I knew it all along. Dad! I swear, I will kill you. Manigan! Yatco? Yatco! Yatco! Yatco! Yatco! Rico! Rico! Fuck! Go home. Manigan! Yatco! That's our way out. Hurry, Yatco. Help me carry him. Let's bring him there. Go on without me. I'm not leaving you! Don't force it. It's too high. Wait. One, two. Dela Cruz! We're going down that way. What the hell? What? Berns! Alda! Fuck! Hey, Judas! - Outside! Run! - Hurry! Judas! Hey! Capture... Dela Cruz. Leave me here. - But, sir... - Don't be stubborn. If anyone can hear me, we are the police! There's been a shootout here! Call 911! Catch him! Hurry! - You actually tried to get away? - Not too loud! You son of a bitch! Miss! They're there! It's dangerous here. I know a place. Miss. You're going to believe that pusher? Where will I go if I betray you? You're the Judas here. - Where? - Let's go. Hurry. This way. Manigan! What? Are you going to act innocent again, Judas? Fuck! I'm so sick of your bullshit! I'm not Judas! I'm tired of your shit! Then why did you try to run earlier? That's his style. Obviously! You deserve that. You let my squad die back in Santa Clara. Fuck, I had nothing to do with that then. And I have nothing to do with this now! Was that you? Tough luck. She's jinxed, all right! Fuck, and you're really Boss Kiko's bitch. You son of a bitch! Don't push me around! You love extorting your "ransom" from him. Over a hundred thousand per bust. You guys really love that, don't you? Believe me, Manigan. I didn't plan for your squad to die. Boss Kiko and I had a good deal. We were all coming out alive. No trouble. But you guys, you're so stubborn, you didn't want to follow orders. We already have him in our sights, and you tell us to pull out? Fuck! And you even got us involved in your illegal shit! You really are the Judas! If he was already in your sights, then why didn't you just shoot? You would've been the good ones who finished the mission, then. He told us he was turning himself in. Manigan. Don't. And you believed him? We let ourselves believe you. What did you do? What's right. You choose. Him or us? Of course, him. You're not the law. PDEA. Do you enjoy being hunted down by us this time? - Just mind your own business... - Boss Chongki! Boss! What the hell is that now, Cocky? That's nothing. Just junk. So what's our plan? Are we killing some motherfuckers tonight? Don't do that in front of me, or I'll smash this megaphone on you. Stop that shit! Stop it! Why are the Tondo Kids here? You called for them? No way! Fucking show-offs. What, you guys got tired of snatching? - Hey! - Motherfucker! Get back! Back! Stop sticking your nose in our business! What are these two fuckers up to? Manigan. I'll take on half of them. You sons of bitches! Follow him, quickly! Chase him! They're still there! Bring it out! Just leave it here, damn it! Hurry! Hurry! Here! Quit fucking around! - It's them. - Hey, careful with that! What the hell is that? We'll do them all in one go. Instead of wasting ammo. You better make sure this gets the job done. It's all on you. I'll have no part in that. This will end them, boss! I'm sure as hell! Step aside. Light it up. - Make it quick! - This is sure as hell, boss! - Will it blow up? - Yes, sir. You've tested it? - Light them all! - Yes, sir. - Just light it up. Set it on fire! - This way! - More! - Here! Hurry! - Boss! - That's it! Boss Biggie! Boss Chongks! I'll finish this for you! - You spread the word, okay? - Okay, boss. Dela Cruz, we already got Kiko. Pullout! Pullout! What? But we have the target! I said pullout! Manigan! Bautista! Guzman, cover me! - We have to get out! - Run! Manigan! Get down! One! Two! Cocky! I'm the one you really want, right? Hell, no! Three! Fuck! Go down! Down! Hurry! Oh, fuck! Retreat! - Help me! - Brando! Here! Hurry! Gang her up! Get back! Go down! Fuck, attack her! Fuck! Have mercy! Please, no! That was my lucky mole! No! Don't kill me! Have mercy! I won't resist! I won't fight you! Don't kill me! You motherfucker! Get back there! I'll take that side. I'm not going to die! That's a bottle cap, not a disinfectant. That won't help you. I believe in this. We're still alive, aren't we? Aren't we lucky... that the two of us are the only ones left? Don't burst my bubble. We'll get out of this. You'll see. I hope so. You still don't believe me? I don't know anymore. Hey. You're not jinxed. I am. I'm quite saddened. If you just listened to me and left us alone, it would've been over between us. - Your comrades would still be alive. - Hey! - They're over here! - Over here! You shameless scums! You always do this to us! Now, you're never escaping this place. Shut up, Chongki! You see what we have to go through every day? If you think you're suffering now, what about us? This is what our lives have become... because of you! We're sick and tired of this! So we'll give you a chance... to leave now and never return! It's not your call, Solomon! It's mine now! They're mine! If you still want to continue this, then kill each other outside! Stop dragging us into your politics! You're out of your damn mind, Solomon! You're just exploiting us in your business! You fucking piece of shit! After all I've done for Gracia, this is all you can say to me, you son of a bitch? No, you son of a bitch! You murdered my child! Leave Gracia now! If we die trying to kill every last one of you, then so be it! But this will be the last! Do you really want this, you son of a bitch? Kill them all! Motherfuckers! Miss! Stay out of it! Get out of the way! Over here! Get out of the way! Chase them! Go back! Go ahead. I'll handle this. Go! Move ahead! Follow them! - Die, you cop! - Trip them up! - You fucker, get back here! - Where are you going? Cops! Hey! Get down here! Where are you going? Get down here! Hey! Follow her! Hurry! Hey! Get down here! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Open the caskets. Come out! You gave us a hard time. Thought you could outsmart me? All your friends are dead! No one's coming to save you. Chongki, in our line of work, no one can really save us. Is that so? Okay. Have you turned off the jammer? Yes, boss. Boss Biggie, it's done. Judas already gave the go signal to get you out of here. Yes, boss. Hey, dudes! Chongki is here! - Boss Chongki! Kiss me! - Set us free! - Our debts are paid! - Your dinner is ready, Chongki! - We've been here for weeks! - We love you, Chongki! Shut the hell up! Boss Chongki! Shoot her! Don't shoot! Take it easy. I killed Judas. Which of them? Dela Cruz. He's a Judas too, but not the real one. Tell me everything you know. Are you going to kill me? My head is worth eighty grand. Or, have you already reached your quota tonight? I'm not part of that. - So you're a good cop! - You son of a bitch! Who is Judas? There are lots of them. But I only deal with one. And you won't find him here. You slaughtered us. You slaughtered us too! Forgive me. Forgive me. You know, this is just business. If we're businessmen, so are you. Actually, it's like we work for you. You see, it's very simple. It's like this. We sell drugs, and it's "illegal." And since we're your "enemies", you will arrest and jail us. Simple! But actions are different from words! Don't forget, our business is also your business! How can there be illegal drugs without the blessing coming from you? You know very well where to find us! But you don't want us jailed because you will lose your income! This? This barely covers all the trouble you've caused me. Do you know how many times you've tried to arrest me? And for every bust, I pay a two-hundred-grand "ransom." Because your intel fund isn't enough, but damn it, I don't give a fuck! I've already been extorted numerous times! In fact, I was ready for this bust. I've already prepared my "ransom." Don't think all of us are corrupt. I lost comrades who were just doing their jobs. You know, all of us, are only puppets of those in power. If we don't follow, they'll disturb us. "Anti-drugs clean-up operations" run by the motherfuckers, and you dimwits simply follow orders. And you even have incentives? Fuck you all! How do you come up with that shit? Twenty grand for a dead pusher, fifty grand for a middleman, and eighty grand for a boss! That's just Dela Cruz. That bald piece of shit? That's a fucking asshole! I'm telling you, that fucking bastard is crazy. He plays dirty. He deals with my competitors to fuck me over. While Alvarez, he fucks and makes a load off all of us. That Rudy? He's only loyal to some. So, when Alvarez asked for extra, I told him, "Fuck you! Hand over Dela Cruz!" Only a moron would show up at Sulayman. Right? The reason why you're here... is because you were double-crossed by Alvarez. Are you shocked that he's Judas? He's the only one we're dealing with. But I know he's just a puppet too. I don't buy your lies. You can say whatever you want. Are you really that dumb? Sir Alvarez. Biggie, have you gotten out? Gracia is a big fucking mess. You're giving me a hard time to cover this up. Hey, my payment's worth it. Not even enough. By the way, return the exchange money. I'm placing that under evidence. We're on standby. Text me when you've left, okay? All right, boss. You said it. He's even taking the exchange money, that greedy motherfucker. See? Can't tell where the pain's coming from, can you? Go ahead. Do it. Do you really think you can do anything? You'll confess everything you've told me. I'd rather pay than fight them. Let's end this. He's all we want. Give him to us. This will not end with Biggie. This will just happen again. Someone new will just replace him and you will still be caught in the middle of the drug raids. This is bigger than us. Can we still do anything? We can... or maybe we can't. But we'll never know if we don't try. Everyone has to know what happened here last night. Let them go. Clear the whole area! I'm sorry about what happened to your teammates. Thank God you survived. This is why the drug war needs to go on. You're a hero! Those animals! Bring them to the hospital. Manigan is our priority. Hurry! Is the ambulance here? - Not yet, sir. - What? Okay, we'll use the utility van. Load them up in the utility van! Hurry! Yes, sir. Got it, sir. No, sir. You won't be affected by this. Are you a friend or... Manigan. Surround every corner! What happened? The suspect fought back. The success of the government's 'War on Drugs' continues. Just last night, the elusive Biggie Chen was finally captured in the district of Gracia ni Maria. According to the police report, 13 people died in the encounter, which include local residents, drug pushers, and PDEA agents. Malacañang Palace extends the President's sincerest commendation to the police for their sacrifice and dedication.
