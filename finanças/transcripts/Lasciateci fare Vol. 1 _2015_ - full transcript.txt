In the last 20 years of the twentieth century the economic elites of Western societies turned history upside down. They regained more power than they ever had and made sure that no one among the people would really notice. Pushed by the free world market, their power exploded while states, democracies and citizens were slowly deprived of their sovereignty. Their system, however, has a flaw: it devours everything it can and eventually ends up devouring itself. After the financial crash of 2007 that hit the world, responsible investment banks are declared too big to fail but the huge holes they cause are covered up everywhere with state money. Both in the United States and in Europe the big banks close to bankruptcy are all bailed out. In the United States some of the great managers were called to answer but this time there were not only men in the dock. Despite the admission of guilt, the accused returned to freedom. On the other hand, ideas cannot be imprisoned. Neoliberalism is the political theory based on affirmation, which arises from the affirmation of the industrial revolution. Hence the affirmation of capitalist society that it finds a system of describing itself: that is, the new bourgeois and capitalist class finds a system of describing itself, its dynamics. Obviously it does so in positive terms, that is in terms of legitimizing the social order in which they find themselves prevailing and trying to give it a rational foundation. It is a thesis that can be traced back to Adam Smith's infamous invisible hand theorem of the late eighteenth century. It was then subsequently reworked in many ways. The basic idea of ​​neoliberalism is that in fact the individual, selfish action of each individual, of each company, allows for a sort of heterogenesis of purposes to lead to collective well-being. In a sense, individual selfishness actually leads to collective well-being. Liberalism believes with Darwin, Darwinism, this type of philosophy: that in the end the best, the strongest, must survive. And it obviously confuses the strongest with the best. In a complex and class-structured society it is obvious that the strongest are the richest, the best equipped. And consequently they want to define themselves as better and perpetuate themselves. This is the weak point of liberalism which in fact struggles to support social mobility, to reward merit and so on. It is a thesis that actually served interests, it served dominant interests. All those who can then exercise power in their action on the market evidently feel protected by this vision of things because they can operate freely. It is no coincidence that the doctrine also known as "Laissez-faire" should actually be reinterpreted as the doctrine of "Laissez-nous faire" that is, "Let us do". There is only one major obstacle to liberalism: democracy. In 1975 an international institution called the Trilateral Commission published a volume written by three different authors entitled "The Crisis of Democracy". The introduction of the Italian edition is signed by Giovanni Agnelli who opens by describing what the Trilateral Commission of which he was a member is: "The Trilateral Commission is a group of private citizens who come together to study and propose balanced solutions to problems of burning international relevance and of common interest." The three authors, each for his area of ​​belonging, describe in detail what are the obstacles in making neoliberalism coexist with democracy. The conclusions of the American Samuel Huntington were these: "some of the problems of government in the United States today arise from an excess of democracy. What democracy needs instead is a greater degree of moderation. Democracy is but one of the sources of authority. In many situations, whoever is better, more experienced or older in the hierarchy can take precedence over the democratic process." It has undoubtedly served, that is, it has given a scientific nature to industrial activity, to microeconomic activity. On the macroeconomic level, on the other hand, it is more purely political, it is a theorization of how and why they find themselves having, and holding, the principles of social justice. Social justice is what they manage to impose with their economic power. However, while subjects endowed with power obviously find advantages from this pervasive dominant ideology, in fact from the point of view of the overall efficiency of the system, we are faced with a series of failures. Liberalism in the 30s entered into crisis with the crisis of '29 in a blatant, obvious way, with colossal increases in unemployment and without any capacity of the system to spontaneously emerge from that crisis. Neoliberalism today enters a crisis because the crisis of 2008, the so-called Great Recession how the International Monetary Fund has defined it, does not seem to be able to resolve itself thanks to market forces. And once again we are faced with a series of testimonies, proofs of the fact that evidently this doctrine, which is often considered scientific, is considered irrefutable and to which fine brains devote themselves in order to defend and support it, in reality this doctrine does not find confirmation in the facts. The symbolic date of the birth of the modern economy is 1776, when Adam Smith publishes his most important work: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations". Thanks to this work, Smith is considered the founding father of liberalism but in reality it has only been used as a pretext. He never wrote that the market was sufficient to satisfy all the needs of the individual, so much so that he considered a free and gratis state education fundamental. Furthermore, the state of Smith was that made up of the oligarchies of the time, of the aristocracy, certainly not referring to a democratic state. The same year as Smith's publication, the American Revolution ends and 13 years later, in the heart of Europe, the French Revolution breaks out. The liberal principles expressed by the French and American constitution and Smith's suggestive ideas on the thrust of the industrial revolution, gave birth to the modern capitalism we know today. The power of the bourgeoisie exploded but at the same time capitalism produced a new class of oppressed. In the nineteenth century the exploitation of labor was very high and the living conditions of workers on the verge of survival. It was for this reason that in the mid-nineteenth century a new intellectual movement set out to subvert the rules. By studying the history of societies and their development in the recent capitalist era, Karl Marx, until then a philosopher, elaborated a profound analysis that changed the view of the economy forever. He prophesied that if conscious and organized workers could overcome capitalism, a system which, as he theorized, produces exploitation and is subject to cyclical crises. Condemned to a single destiny: to implode on itself. While Marx's ideas were inflaming masses of workers across Europe, three economists, taking up Smith's invisible hand principle, invent a new theory. It is called "general equilibrium" and affirms that the entire market, if it is not subjected to interference by the states, regulates itself, generating well-being for the entire community. This new economic current will be elaborated later by other economists and will take the name of neoclassicism. The basis of modern neoliberalism. The bourgeoisie of the early twentieth century and above all the great bankers and industrialists understand that the principles of the neoclassical economy serve their interests perfectly. Governments at the turn of the century were little more than committees for their affairs and economic policy choices throughout the West therefore moved in the direction of "Let us do". Capitalism runs so fast that trade becomes global, as do the interests of the elite, as do wars. While more than 10 million workers, having become soldiers, die in the trenches, in Russia, the masses of workers and peasants led by Lenin give life to the October revolution. The largest state in the world abandoned capitalism. On the ideas of Marx, Lenin built a new type of state, a new social model without private property, without market economy and free enterprise which would ensure that work was no longer exploited and that the state was no longer a means in the hands of the elites only. Marxism-Leninism will soon become Stalinism and the old elites will be replaced by new ones but in fact from that moment Russia has withdrawn from the games. In the West, however, the games remain open. Capitalism runs fast, firmly tied to the reins of liberalism. Social imbalances and poverty are increasing more and more. Many are forced to abandon their land. Those who remain, on the other hand, will be forced to obey new ideologies. But if liberalism in Europe produces dictatorships and wars, in the United States it continues to run free. The market, especially the financial one, has no limitations of any kind. Stocks and stocks grow more and more, inflating a bubble that seems to never end. Until one Thursday in late October 1929 in the Wall Street Stock Exchange Building the ghost of Marx and his old prophecy showed up. That day was the first time that capitalism collapsed on itself. By neoliberalism we mean an economic doctrine that was born in reaction to the social economy for the public interest that exploded with Marx throughout the period of the so-called classical thinkers. It had a very important relaunch after the First World War with thinkers like John Robinson and obviously John Maynard Keynes but I can't help but remember Michał Kalecki that nobody remembers. A Pole, an economic genius. These men and women created the social economy, that of the so-called welfare, the Beveridge in England. They created an economic idea that led us from Dickens' 800, that is, the exploitation of poor people, children who worked in the mines, to the idea that a company is a state that had to use its own currency for the public interest guaranteeing rights. It is a thesis that starts from what is the doctrine of the so-called critical economists. First of all John Maynard Keynes. When Keynes wrote - and he wrote in the time of the Great Depression of the 1930s - he argued that evidently without the intervention of the economic policy authorities, a capitalist economy is not able spontaneously to reach full employment. In this sense and according to this vision, it is necessary that the intervention of political authorities, of the government as well as of the central bank, must be coordinated precisely in order to create that overall demand for goods and services that allows the production of goods to grow and therefore the employment of workers to a sufficient extent to be able to create full employment. In 1933, President Roosevelt implemented a plan to get the United States out of the Great Depression based primarily on the Keynesian model. It took the name of the New Deal. The first measure of the New Deal is the enactment of the Glass-Steagall law which provides for the separation of commercial banks from investment banks. Subsequently, dozens of state programs for job creation are created. The millions of unemployed who enter those state plans work on the construction of large public works such as roads, dams, schools, public buildings and services to the citizens. Unemployment is quickly halved and infant deaths, suicides, crimes and disease decrease. And at the same time, public utility works are being built all over the United States. The New Deal radically changes the role of the state in the economy. Public power is no longer a mere spectator. On the contrary, it becomes the regulator of the system. The Roosevelt government is also the first in the history of the United States to enter into a collaborative relationship with the unions, involving them in the measures. The United States is recovering from the Great Depression thanks to Roosevelt's social policies. In Europe, on the other hand, nationalisms are becoming more and more aggressive. As the war causes tens of millions of civilian and soldier deaths, in 1944, there was a major conference in Bretton Woods, United States, in which future victors agreed on trade relations once the conflict was over. At Bretton Woods, Keynes proposed a model aimed at protecting economies that applied a criterion of solidarity between states but his proposal was not accepted. Instead, that of Harry Dexter White was chosen which led to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Economic organizations that could lend money to adhering countries but that a few decades later will turn into powerful weapons in the hands of the elites. World War II ends. The United States and the Soviet Union are the big winners. Germany, occupied by the allied armies, is divided. And with her, the whole world is divided. In 1945 Europe was reduced to rubble. The cities are devastated by bombing and the population severely impoverished. But in that political void created by the war, European societies reach a new awareness. The Beveridge report entered the agenda policy of the Labor party that won the elections in the United Kingdom in 1945. If in England the political balance simply changes, in France, Italy and Germany, on the other hand, new constitutions are drawn up. Liberalism was considered the cause of the imbalances it created and therefore the new theories - the Keynesian theory - regulated society. They ruled it on the basis that much of the Keynesian economic model was incorporated into the constitutions. In various ways then, in England, where there is no rigid written constitution, there was the famous Beveridge Report. In short, the company began a little to reconsider the balance. This, however, was a tremendous setback. A tremendous setback to which we say the liberal soul of capitalism, almost totalitarian, was willing to continue making concessions in the post-war period of the twentieth century, after the Second World War, because there were Stalin's tanks, because there was the Soviet bloc, the Iron Curtain and then liberalism, if it had revealed itself again in its attempt to control society in its previous forms, would have unleashed a reaction not only of social instability but of real revolution. The hold on the people that the socialist and communist parties had in the immediate postwar period and the Soviet giant by now at the gates of Europe unbalanced the political equilibrium. The post-war constitutions in fact attested to a change of era that had begun ten years earlier with the New Deal in the United States. The democratic state that intervenes in the economy for the development and well-being of the entire community. The Constitution of Italy of 1948 is perhaps the most advanced social treaty that humanity has written. And it is, more than the others, conditioned by the Keynesian model. In fact, its fundamental rights can only be guaranteed by state spending. The Constitution has actually never really been applied. The sixties and seventies saw severe struggles in the squares and in the factories. Democracies, as the authors of "The Crisis of Democracy" also wrote, in those years were impetuous and workers obtained unexpected rights until a few years earlier. In the mid-1970s, other nations freed themselves from new and old dictatorships. In Portugal, Greece and Spain, new constitutions with a strong social content are being drawn up. In the 30 years that followed the war, Europe earned the nickname "Continent of rights". In a certain sense, a good face was put on a bad game and therefore continued in the concession to the Keynesian model, to democratic constitutions, to the creation of social rights and therefore to the redistribution to multi-class society, that is to a political power that was shared, in which the political class it had the function of mediation not only of representing the economically prevailing interests but of mediation between the various economic or social classes. In the early 1970s, capitalism was really changing face. The Keynesian system adopted by the governments and the social rights gained by the peoples were pushing the whole West towards a new social order where poverty and misery left room for the formation of a new economic class: the middle class. The masses, ever richer and more powerful, would never again be blackmailed as before. But the idea of ​​a return, of a revenge, always remained latent. And this aspiration then finds cultural references precisely in the neoliberal economists who have various strands but the main one - the one that had the most influence - was that of the Austrian school of von Mises, von Hayek who in turn, for various vicissitudes that now it would take a long time to retrace, it has a huge direct influence on the Chicago school, on the monetarism that is embodied in Friedman. When you find the perception that there is a loosening of the deterrent capacity of the Soviet bloc, a sort of continuous tension for which they were trying to implode this system - and then it actually succeeded - the attempt to recover all the lost ground begins. So these what they do: they want to bring the machine back and say: "This social economy is not good for us. It has given too much power to the people, too much power to consumers, too much power to families, the idea of ​​the welfare state is an aberration. The state - and this is the number one point of neoliberalism - has grown too large. It is heavy, it is huge, it is powerful, it has the army, it has the sovereign parliament, it has the currency to infinity, therefore an economic power that no private individual can ever have. This state must shrink". And indeed the number one dogma of neoliberalism is to shrink the state, practically make it disappear from the scene. The theories of the Austrian and later Chicago schools give new life to the aspirations of the elites. It is in fact from the studies of Hayek and Friedman that the ideology of "Let us do" takes the name of neoliberalism. Milton Friedman has the opportunity to explain this worldview in numerous lectures, academic debates, television talk shows, and even a TV series. From this excerpt, the key concepts of neoliberalism can be understood. There are no acquired rights, housing, health, education and work. Each individual has to earn them on the market. Workers are individual cells in competition with each other. Everyone will be rewarded based on their productivity. Investments must be decided by businessmen and companies that are most capable by nature. Wealth must flow from top to bottom. The condition is that the state and the trade unions must not interfere and society will move towards a natural order: the order of the markets. At one point it was decided to practically give the vote to the markets. Yes, the market vote. That is, to take it away from the citizens. That is, the citizens are no longer those who have to decide on the goodness or otherwise of their country's economic policy choices, but rather the markets that decide. Why? Because there is this presumption that it is a current of neoliberal thought that says that markets regulate themselves while instead it is absolutely not true that markets regulate themselves because this principle actually means that the state must absolutely not intervene, must not interfere in the mechanisms of market because the market finds its right balance, for better or worse. While instead we have seen at the state of affairs that the markets not only do not find the right balance but also create such big problems where then the state must intervene in support. Ignoring the fundamentals of the economics of macroeconomics - which are the Keynesian ones, because liberal macroeconomics does not exist - liberalism is wrong because it wants to apply the criteria of business management to macroeconomics, therefore to the state, therefore to large figures etc. corporatized and this does not stand up to the criticism of history. While classical and Keynesian economic theories elaborate their principles by studying reality, neoclassical ones instead adapt reality to their principles. The free market could work but in a system of perfect competition. In a society where people all have the same means, the same information, the same wealth, the same social status. The idea that distinguishes neoliberalism is that the action of the central bank must not be aimed at creating employment, the government must reduce the public deficit as much as possible and in general the state must reduce its overall size compared to the rest of the economy and furthermore it is necessary that the state abandon a whole series of sectors in which it may have operated through massive processes of divestment and privatization. They believe that if I do not subtract resources from the private sector, this will be induced to spend and invest more because it will have expectations of having a greater availability of expenditure and therefore everyone will tend to either consume or invest more - crowding out - and therefore this would reduce greater growth. Because while if those resources are taken by the state, they are used in efficiently if the same amount of resources, of wealth, is left in the hands of the private, the private will automatically be able to use them more efficiently. But this is a purely hypothetical theory. It has never occurred in history even when neoclassicals first theorized this. As for the large privatization process in Italy - in Italy in the nineties - in the nineties Italy achieved the world record of privatizations after the United Kingdom. Well, today we can take stock of that massive privatization process according to the conclusion reached by the Court of Audit. Privatizations have led to a sharp increase in costs and a great gain for the so-called mediators, that is, of all those investment banks of those intermediaries who stood between buyers and sellers at the time of the divestment operations. Finally, paradoxically, privatizations very often led to an increase in tariffs, contrary to the vulgate, contrary to the dominant ideology. Here, the Italian case is a case for example, in which we note how the whole ideology of privatization as a factor of efficiency and has not found reliable confirmation in the data. The public debt must be entrusted to the markets and cannot be subject to the intervention of the treasury through the central bank which must respond to the indications of the government, of the treasury of each country. The idea of deflation as a permanent goal - or rather deflation - of inflation control as a permanent goal which is this basic idea, this hostility, the idea that the public debt therefore the state must be made a debtor under common law like any other economic entity and therefore we must turn to markets and cannot print money because by printing money it increases inflation. Which is not detectable. Even today, we continue to have to refute this idea. An economic ideology that basically says this: "The state must stop using money". His weapon, his number one cannon, his power, his number one firearm for the social economy It must stop using the coin. And how did they convince the states? They invented dogmas, fears, non-existent ghosts with which they paralyzed politics and public opinion. They invented the dogma and the ghost of public debt. The state spends too much, it creates the public debt which is the debt of the citizens - everyone believed it - this thing is completely false because the public debt is a kind of state which is the credit of the citizens, it is not the debt of the citizens and it never will be for the next two million years. But they have all convinced that the public debt is the debt of the citizens. Everyone was afraid of the state that spends. They invented the phantom of inflation. If the state spends on social goods, on health, on pensions, there will be inflation. Inflation means that we all go to buy bread with wheelbarrows. They took the ghost of the Weimar Republic, they waved it in all the newspapers, on all sides and of course they created this terrorism. Inflation is a ghost. I give you a fact: Japan, USA, England and the ECB itself have been trying for years with all their means to create inflation and they are not succeeding. But the neoliberals have convinced public opinion and politicians that inflation is a monster and the state must not spend. So away the money from social services, pensions, public salaries and so on. The dominant thesis, the neoliberal thesis is that the flexibility of employment contracts, precariousness, allow for an increase in employment levels because according to the neoliberals, if contracts are flexible then entrepreneurs should be incentivized to increase employment levels, they should be have more incentives to hire. In reality, if we look at the data once again, if we look once again at the empirical tests that have been carried out over more than twenty years on this issue, well we realize that it is not possible to establish any correlation between the increase in job insecurity and increased employment. Nothing less than the OSCE has come to this conclusion. The OSCE has been a supporter of the liberal theses, more convinced, more determined, has adopted, has carried out a series of empirical research in an attempt to demonstrate that the flexibility of work leads to more employment and it has not succeeded. These empirical researches have actually produced results that contradict the doctrine. The same chief economist of the International Monetary Fund Olivier Blanchard in 2006 recognized precisely that it is not possible to establish any relationship between greater precariousness and greater employment. Therefore, as in the very top of the world economic institutions, the defenders, supporters of a doctrine that we could define as neoliberal, have actually recognized that the idea that more employment can be determined by greater precariousness is in reality an idea that is not reflected. In their conception, for example, the use of a subsidy to those who are taken out of the world of work. For example, the concept of citizenship income is present in Hayek and therefore in a certain sense the more aggressively neoliberal economic process does not exclude the fact that one can then go and help the most disadvantaged but always does it with a class vocation, deeply classist. That is, it is preferred that a person stay at home and have no work and that perhaps, however, enjoy a monetary subsidy rather than having that person in the workplace. The reason is political, not economic. Because by excluding this whole series of people from the world of work, I also exclude them from the decision-making capacity on what, how much and how to produce and consequently I leave this decision in the hands of a few and if you want to react, challenge these policies not it must be done simply from the economic side, that is, it must not be explained only that economically they do not work because in itself it is not sufficient to understand why they exist. They exist to eliminate a growing segment of the population from decision-making capacity. When you do not have a job but you are subsidized you are not fully citizens and consequently even if I eat, live, survive, etc. I do not participate fully in the democratic process. This dominant economic thought that sees capital as the benefactor of humanity as long as it is absolutely free from any constraint, this has meant media, it has meant large newspapers, it has meant television, it has meant university teaching. For 30 years in university economics courses, we say that between 90-95 percent have been teaching neoliberal economic theories. Even after the crisis from 2007-2008 severely beaten up these theories. This neoliberal revenge that has shrunk the states has defeated the classical economy for the public interest has paid - because it is obviously the big financial capitals that are behind - it has paid the journalists, it has paid the televisions, it has paid the intellectuals, it has paid the university, but we have proof of this. Karl Brunner, the great economic name of twentieth-century neoliberalism, said at a conference in 1976 - if I'm not mistaken in Bremen, Germany - he said "We must conquer the universities, conquer the publishers of the textbooks of economics, pay our own authors to say what we say". As a counter-offensive, started in the universities and in the so-called "think tanks" - that is, the reservoirs of thought - already in the 50s and 60s the Chicago boys, of which Milton Friedman was the best known representative. As early as the 1950s, in a climate of cold war, a US government program, created to combat socialism in South America, began to finance exchanges of economics students with the University of Chicago. Milton Friedman and his people thus have the opportunity to indoctrinate hundreds of economists who returned to their countries in the hope of being able to influence the economic choices of their governments. The experiment of the so-called Chicago boys was tried in several states of South America but only in one there were the favorable conditions to experiment their studies: Chile. Under the regime of Augusto Pinochet. In 1971, two years before its rise, Unidad Popular, the Chilean left-wing coalition led by Salvador Allende wins the elections. Its program envisages the nationalization of raw materials and primary services to the population, the increase in wages, the freezing of prices on consumer goods and the participation of workers in the management of state industries. Allende's project is aimed at the realization of a democratic socialism and its fulfillment can upset the political and economic equilibrium of the whole world. At the end of 1972, Allende spoke at the United Nations no only dennouncing the US de-stabilization but to indicate something much more serious: the lack of control over multinationals and their harmful role. This was just before the neo-liberalism, that today dominates the world. We are before a truly frontal conflict between the large multinational corporations and the States. They are being under threat in their most fundamental political, economical and military decisions by global corporations that do not depend on any State, and whose activities are not fiscalised by and do not answer to any Parliament, or any institution that represents the commom interest. In a word: the very political structure of the world is being undermined. Allende denounces the activity of American multinationals that exploit labor and raw materials in Chile and the rest of South America. The implementation of the Unidad Popular program would wipe out any possibility for American business to exploit labor and resources on Chilean territory. But Chile also poses a threat beyond the Iron Curtain. The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party never fully supported Allende and his party. The example of a democratic socialism would have brought down the foundations of their system of power. It is above all the example of Allende that frightens the power. Chile would have been a model for other states to follow and could have triggered a chain reaction across South America. Allende's project had to be stopped in the bud. A real economic war led by the United States is unleashed against Chile. But the Unidad Popular government is resisting and the consensus among the Chilean people continues to grow. Without being a martyr, I shall not give a single step back! Let them know that! I will leave the Moneda only when I have carried out the people's mandate! I have no alternative, Only by shooting me will they stop my will of carrying out the people's programme! Sept. 11. The enemies of freedom carried out an act of war against our country. At the first light of dawn, armored troops advanced against our presidential palace. Allende, his ministers and advisers were inside. Allende did not flee while the Palacio de La Moneda was being bombed. He was murdered. The coup was led by General Pinochet but backed and supported by the US government and the CIA. After the harsh repression on the Chilean people, Pinochet now had to return the favor to those who had helped him to take power. The request is simple: to call back Milton Friedman's Chicago boys. Chicago graduates will occupy all key positions to govern the Chilean economy: the ministry of economics, finance, the central bank, as well as university professorships and newspaper editors. The reforms imposed were very hard and only feasible by a brutal dictatorship. Neoliberalism hands Chile back into the hands of American business, interrupting the great economic and social development that the Allende government was carrying out. His ideas and his actions, however, leave history a great example and in a few years his words become prophecy. The large multinational corporations not only go against the interests of developing countries, their dominating and uncontrolled action exists also in the industrialised nations where they establish themselves. It is our trust in ourselves, that which increases our faith in the great values of Mankind, in the certainty that these values shall prevail, that they cannot be destroyed! When Allende gave this speech, the power of multinationals was only a crumb of what it is today. In the mid-1970s, in the United States and Europe, democracies were increasingly participated. The socialist and communist parties had a great popular consensus and the union struggles, determined and resolute, involved all the workers. "If there will be occupation, there will also be from our part. Night and day if necessary. All of us together." To impose neoliberal policies it was necessary to circumvent the obstacle or to influence public opinion with a slow and long work of infiltrating every place that allowed those ideas to be transmitted. Universities and the media were the main targets. To infiltrate politics, however, something more was needed. In those years the so-called "think tanks" were born and spread, authentic reservoirs of thought in which to train white-collar workers to be inserted in positions of power in the institutions. When in the mid-70s an oil crisis due to the closing of the taps by the producing countries causes inflation to soar throughout the West, the Keynesian system is no longer able to guarantee the same degree of development as in previous years. For those who worked a lifetime to tear down that system, that was the moment of the limelight. In '74 Friedrich von Hayek won the Nobel Prize for economics and in '76 the prize went into the hands of Milton Friedman. Friedman, go home! Friedman, go home! Long live the people of Chile! Freedom! Stop the capitalism! From that moment it was a little over two years before Friedman's ideas found a place in the parliament and government of a democratic country. In 1979 Margaret Thatcher won the elections in Great Britain. Although British society reacts strongly to its policies, the process has begun and as Thatcher herself said there is no alternative. Two years after Thatcher's victory in the United Kingdom, it was Ronald Reagan's turn in the United States. Winning the election was child's play for a former Hollywood actor mainly because none of his films were funded like his campaign. To bring neoliberalism to the United States you needed an actor and who better than an actor could have read a script like this: The political intentions of the Reagan government were immediately clear, as were those of Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan presided over their respective governments for most of the 1980s. They introduce reforms that demolish the social rights won in previous decades and profoundly transform society. Large pockets of poverty are forming again and as at the beginning of the twentieth century, ever richer elites acquire immense global power. The Reagan government immediately resumes the colonial policy that the previous Carter government was easing. For this new colonialism no warships and occupation troops are needed: to plunder the resources of a nation and keep it in a state of misery, just use the debt trap. The weapons are the dollars of the International Monetary Fund and the neoliberal economic recipes. But it happens, sometimes, that someone does not fit. "Here's another one. You have a Levi's branded shirt so you advertise at Levi's. Sure, they did that shirt right. Levi's makes very nice jeans. For real. But it's an American product and you're not American, you're not from San Francisco and it says San Francisco. So?! Do they at least pay you? Because if they don't pay you it doesn't make sense. And that other one back there, the one who asked a question earlier. Harvard? But do you at least know where it is? Sometimes I don't understand anything anymore. Too many oddities, don't you think? But do you really think that here we don't know and we can make nice t-shirts? Thomas Sankara wants the inhabitants of their country, Burkina Faso, to benefit from their resources and consume the goods they produce themselves. Assassination technicians. It was they who proposed the financing channels, the lenders. Telling us that these were the right things to do to get our country's development, the growth of our people and its well-being off the ground. We were presented with packs of appealing financial dossiers and prospectuses. Those files were very elegant. But now we find ourselves in debt for the next 50, 60 years and possibly more. That is, we have been persuaded to compromise our peoples for 50 years and more. They want all their money back. They tell us that otherwise there would be a crisis. But no, Mr. President. They played, now they can even lose. They are the rules of their game and life will go on. But if Burkina Faso is left alone to refuse to pay, I will not be there at the next conference. If, on the other hand, I have the support of all of you, - support of which I will have a great need - if we are all united we can avoid paying and therefore use our resources for the development of our countries. Sankara was killed on October 15, 1987. The hand that held the gun was that of his former friend, General Blaise Compaoré, who with the approval of the Reagan and Mitterrand governments took his place in the government. As Burkina Faso and other developing countries are again subjugated by the interests of Western elites, neoliberalism continues its charge in every corner of the world. Even where you would never expect. Deng Xiaoping, the new leader of the Communist Party of China, is suddenly fascinated by Friedman's ideas. His phrase "We must allow a few men to get rich so that all the others will benefit from it" is still famous in China. But at the end of the 80's there is a real turning point in history. Germany is being reunited and the Soviet Union is about to dissolve. Beyond the wall, waiting for the Russians, there was no freedom and democracy or that capitalism with a human face that everyone expected. On the eve of the first democratic elections in Russia after 80 years of regime, the British weekly The Economist headlined an article urging Gorbachev to follow Pinochet's Chilean model. The Washington Post echoed it by publishing an article that even reads that "an economy needs free markets but not free people to function". The entire industrial apparatus of the former Soviet Union is privatized. In the following years, Russia sinks so quickly into misery and abject poverty that the life expectancy of Russians drops by almost ten years. A real, authentic and little-told social catastrophe. In less than twenty years, neoliberalism went from the books and theories of Hayek and Friedman to the decisions of the majority of governments in the world. No, not all over the world. The Old Continent, with its constitutions, still resisted. No siege would have brought down its walls. To conquer it, a deception was needed.
