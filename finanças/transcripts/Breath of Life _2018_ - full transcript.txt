Can't we send it? Do we know what they'll say? It's the second last chance operation. So what? We stop now and that's it? That's what you suggest? Just not out there by herself with nothing. If she must leave, at least do a scan. Why? With a scan it either shows nothing and it's useless or it shows us something we can't treat. So let's avoid spending 800 euros for nothing. We must stop spending money. And I think the time's now. She's been in our care 4 years, right? Six. You know it's the end of the road. She should be in palliative care. That's what they'd have done there. Let's continue with palliative then. It's not.. it's not just to get rid of her, she told us she didn't want to die in hospital, her husband can't take any more, he's spent days here. I'm not saying stop everything, we'll organise home care, arrange the necessary services and that's that. She'll die the way she wanted. I don't know what more we can wish for her. A FILM BY DAVID ROUX L'ORDRE DES MÉDECINS How long has it been? 3 days? I think you're finished. Do you have a fever? Take your temperature... Humm. You have what we call a cold. A big cold if you want. Take an aspirin, some soup and go to bed, I'll call you back. OK. What's that? -ICU. -Yeah, it's my next training. So ... urinary tract infection? No no no... Urinary infections make up a quarter of all infections in intensive care -or so. -I can't concentrate on that. What's up? It's pissing me off. Friday, she seemed better... I would have liked to have said goodbye or talk to the family. You did what you could. You did nothing wrong. She's there, in the ICU you can still go and see her but is it your place? I feel like I'm giving up on them. It's normal. If you want to go to see them, do it for them, not you. You're not great there, middle finger there... Fred, did you put money in the kitty? Yeah, yeah. You never put money back in. No, wait, I put some in 15 days ago. This guys owes money to everyone. -I'm the only one working. -We didn't wait. I see. -You're kidding. -Put money in the kitty. -Calm down, it's OK. -It's horrible, does anyone know what this is? I have sushi, if you want? Any cookies? -You keeping them for later? -I've put them away. -Are they're good? -They're good. May I? Cranberry cookie. Two euros for the sushi. Two euros? They're good. We can't stay here, ambulance arrives in 3 minutes. -What is it? -Massive hemoptysis. As bloody as you like. Not up to the Big Mac suicide. What? -Big Mac suicide. -An old story. What? One day a young girl is admitted, very anorexic, 4 or 5 years of only nuts and water and one day she decides to go to McDonald's and eat... 3 or 4 Big Macs. And she comes in. A Big Mac pregnancy. ...huge, with skin so stretched I could hardly use the scalpel and bang, explosion. On the ceilings, the walls, everywhere. -Did she die? -Yes. -Oh yes. -That's horrible. We took a piece of lettuce, a piece of tomato, and made a little sandwich. Oh you're disgusting. Tomorrow, if I pay, we can go to McDonald's. If you pay. We're going all the way to room 17. OK. It'll be alright, sir. Caroline, come with me. They'll settle you in. Goodbye, sir. Hello. Hold on, don't waste. Great, thanks, pass me the oxygen. -Are you finding breathing hard? -Hold the oxygen. -OK. -It's going to be alright, sir. We'll put you on this bed. You can put your hand here. We're going to move you here. Come on. One, two, three. Is that better? Perfect. We'll be on our way then. Hang in there, sir. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, thank you. How did the transfer go? I've had him for an hour. He's stable. -Good. Did he vomit blood again? -No. So... A film x-ray: that's Stone Age stuff. That's all they gave me at the ER in Montreuil. -Could you sign this? -Yeah. OK. -Thanks. -Bye. I'll let you do the exam. Take the time you need. Let him tell you his story if he can. You have to get him to spit in here. OK., alright. -Hello sir. -Hello. I'm the intern on duty. I'm going to examine you. Can you tell me what day it is? -No. -No? OK. You know what hospital this is? He works in the markets. He's gotten up every day at 4 a.m. for the last 40 years, but until now, he didn't seem to want to slow down, but he's lost 12 kilos since December. He says things are pretty bad. His back pain is what bothers him the most. That's not great. How long has he been coughing up blood? Since Saturday or Sunday, but not a lot. Show me. There's nothing in there. No, he said he's never coughed up more. What is hemoptysis to you? A few traces of blood in saliva? Not coughing up half a cup of blood. Your colleague made a bad diagnosis or took me for a ride. Both are serious. Getting rid of patients like that is borderline. We won't take anyone else from your service. Yeah, well, that's how it is. Yeah, goodbye. He's not really in good shape, though. Of course we'll to take care of the man. But they know not to take me for a fool. Yes, dad, hurry up. I'm really behind. Wait, calm down. Since when? Where is she now? Can she walk or not? No, you're not calling EMS. Bring her here. To hell with her choir. She's coming here to be examined. OK? I love you. This morning his creatinine was still 180 and the saturation went back to acceptable. It's not when we want it, at 8:30 a.m., it's the same time for everyone. This man, is he still on oxygen? We left him overnight. He had 3 liters and they were removed first thing. Around 6:30 a.m. he's stable, around 90. It's running its course. We can plan for discharge. You see with the 4th if they have room, and you send him to them tomorrow at the latest. Now, in 17, Mr Cherkaoui: tell me everything. Agathe. He's a man in his sixties who arrived yesterday from the Montreuil ER with a hemoptysis. It wasn't as heavy as described, but he's in respiratory distress and is complaining of acute lumbar pain. There he is. Did you see anyone? I've not been here long. Yeah... You colleagues aren't very chatty. She's with the doctor. How was she? You know.. She doesn't say much so... Not good. She really wasn't well. She scared me. She's over here. I'll see if I can find out more. -Hi. -Well? I can't tell you much for the time being. Septic shock. She was having stomach pains and with her history, we start treating her right away, we gave her antibiotics. We'll see if that helps a little. -Ok. -We're trying things. Oncology's been told, Adjadj's coming by. OK., great. -That's it. -Thanks. -It's me. -Oh Simon. I'm bothering you. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. -Your work. -This is my work, mom. I'm happy to see you. Your hair looks good like that. I've not seen you in a while. At least three weeks. How do you feel? OK... I was feeling so weak. And I... I... had a dizzy spell. And now? -Saturday I have rehearsal. -Your choir. Honestly, I'm not sure, mom. You went into septic shock. That's a blood infection. It's serious. So we have to treat it and understand why it happened. Saturday's a long way off. How's your father going to manage the store? Don't worry. He's looked after it for 40 years. He can do it without you. They gave you antibiotics. They're going to help. They'll move you to the ICU when there's a bed free. OK. -Do you need anything? -No, thank you. -I'll be back to check on you soon. -Ok. -You're not doing any better. -Well noticed. Here. Take two tablets morning, noon and evening. Isn't it just a cold? You're going to treat your cold now, or I'll quarantine you. You can't pass that on to mom. Oh fuck. -I can't believe it's started again. -We knew it. Yeah, well knowing these things, it doesn't help me. It feels like it was yesterday. I'm not ready, for the operations, chemo, -dealing with dad. -Don't get carried away, we're not there yet, OK? And what's he doing? He's convinced he's going to spend the night here. Nonsense. You want to tell him? It's really no use. -Do you want another? It's cold. -No, it's OK. She'll be out for at least 24 hours. You should go home. We're not staying? You can stay this afternoon, but besides her resting there are no jobs. Believe me, now's not the time to wear yourself out. Can you sort her things? In case they keep her a while. Come see her tonight and first thing tomorrow morning. You can't take her in your department? I'd feel more comfortable. Dad, that's nonsense. I'm a pulmonologist. It's totally unrelated. I can't do anything for her. OK, OK, as you wish. You know best. And at that time, you have the queen mother, -that bitch... -Hold on, tell me after. OK., breathe deeply, one last time. There, great. So she's pissed because her son King Tommen snitched on her. And to get revenge, she blows her brains out. And then you have the High Sparrow, Loras, all, they all explode, and then you've got Tommen, him, he... he sees it from afar, in his palace, because there's a guard who kept him from the trial and he works out right away that his mother did it. Do you know what he did? No? Doc, are you following me? It's season 4 - I'm lost. You work too much, seriously. You have to watch it. Don't need to, I hear it from you. -Did you eat at least? -Yeah, it was delicious. He throws himself out the window. -What? -Tommen kills himself. It was so good. I can't wait for season 7. Alright, see you later. Look at this one. I don't get the resort. You don't do anything. Excuse me Simon, the guy in 12 wants you. -What does he want? -The usual: to leave. I can't take anymore nut-jobs. -I'll be there in a minute. -OK., I'll tell him. So Mr Hamon, what's going on? Oh doctor, it's wonderful, I've got a new lease of life. Really, I'm like a... a young man again. No more breathlessness, no pain when I inhale. Nothing, nothing at all. I'm like a shiny new penny. My wife isn't doing well at all. She's been all alone for five days. Could you tell her I'm getting out this afternoon? I'm not doing that and you're not going to leave. We talked about this yesterday. You have to stop. No, I understand. But it's really not going well. -I have to go. -And the x-rays? We talked about doing tests. Did you do them? No, not yet. -But I'm doing a lot better. -What I'd like is to be sure that you get the x-rays. If I let you leave today, what'll happen? Will you return next week for tests? I'm not so sure. We'll do the tests and then you can leave. Tell your wife that. She'll manage. I'm doing a tourniquet. OK. I'm going to squeeze your arm a bit. OK., make a tight fist. Perfect. How are you? Not too tired? Did you see Adjadj? What's next? I know you don't want to, but for now, we don't know if you need chemo or radiation. I don't know anyone who enjoys that, but if it comes to that, you need to be ready. We won't have a choice. Dad, dad. -I thought you were going home. -What time is it? Late. I'll call you a taxi in five minutes. Are you OK? You scared us out of our wits. -So your mother's back? -Yeah, Adjadj saw her. Yeah, I saw the file. At this hour, there's nothing else to be done.. I won't lie; after what I saw, surgery would be too dangerous. The pericardium might have been affected. Listen, we'll see how it develops, but I won't go back in there. Asshole. I'm sorry, but visits start at 2pm. No visitors in the morning. I'm sorry, I didn't know. We won't send you home. But you have to leave the room. We must prepare your husband for a scan. Come with me. -Hello Mr Cherkaoui. -Hello. -How are you? -Good. Did you sleep? You can wait here. Please doctor, I wanted to ask you: the TV in the room, -it doesn't work. -It's not me you want. You must go downstairs to reception. -But there's a fee. -Oh OK. Tell me why there was someone in room 17? Be careful, dammit. People just waltz in and out. What do you think of that? At the upper right, there's a tumor in the upper lobe. But it doesn't tell all, the kind of tumor, it's status. We'll fill things in with a scan. OK, and meanwhile what do I tell him? There's nothing to say. We're looking. Until we've seen everything, we can't say anything. -So we just leave him like that? -What would you say? "Sir, you have cancer, well, actually no, "we're not sure, but still." We don't have a diagnosis. Our job is to prescribe. Until you know a treatment, there's nothing to say. It's better to know, isn't it? No, it's not. Trust me. -So? -We're not going to operate. At least we can avoid that. For now, yes. Is that good news? If you like. -You can go back in. -Here, go on. -What does 'if you like' mean? -Nothing. It means she's in no condition to undergo surgery right now and we have no idea if it's necessary or not. So yeah, if we like, we can take it as good news. So? So, let's say that it's good news. Alright, I have to go. -You're not staying? -I'm on call. I got it. Other people work too. What are you talking about? They can't go an evening without you. I can't do more here. -You can be here. -I am here. You're not here. You just stop by. You're gone. You feel wronged every day. Could you not slack off once for your mother? You're confusing things. I can let a few die if you think that'll change anything. There's nothing to do. She's under control and asleep. Nothing else will happen. OK? -Bye, goodnight. -Bye. I don't understand your hesitations with cases like this. I'm saying this for the ducklings behind me. This is a textbook case. -Hello. -Hello. How have you been since last week? No better, no worse. I see things look stable. No specific pain, no fever. No. But your weight's still not up. You need to eat. Even if you're not hungry you must try. We really can't do it for you. Yes, mother. I see you still have your sense of humor. That's something. Things are coming along, OK? Remember, the entire team is doing everything they can. We're going to get you better, OK? Promise. Come on. That girl's been here for six months. Can you save her? You're the savior, is that it? With your little coat and big mouth. Cat got your tongue? Let me tell you, you won't make her better, not you or anyone else. Cystic fibrosis: heard of it? A failed transplant, you know what that is? You don't know anything. This is the last time. Don't ever do that again. Go on, get out of here. What happened? Yeah, OK, he's stupid, but he meant well. He told a dying girl she'd live. -But he's an extern. He's learning. -He's not there yet. I'm telling you. Honestly, I hope she didn't hear everything. My mother's in the ICU. Shit, I'm sorry. It's been two days. She went into septic shock, an old case of ovarian cancer. She got good care, she's being watched. -I didn't know. -No one knows. Is everything OK? For now it's OK, but there's no reason to be cheerful. And you? I'm OK. My family thinks I'll save her. Great. You should have seen, her face suddenly lit up. -What is that? -What? It looks like a wake. She likes it. You know what we learn here? As long as death hasn't won, we're still alive. Exactly, see? She's still alive. She wanted to sing. Yeah, Fred? You're no stretcher bearer. -You've never taken them? -Yeah, but years ago. I don't know how to roll now. -Is it far? -Over here. -Hey, how's it going? -Fine. Doing well. Hi. What can I do for you? It's for him. He needs to relax. -Hello. -Hi. Here. I never knew my parents. I mean my real parents. My foster parents, sure, but it's not the same. There were a few. I didn't know. When I was 18, I didn't give a shit. Later, when I wanted to find them, it was too late. I never saw my parents. I'm sorry, I didn't know. -What? What? -I'm kidding. Fuck, you're an idiot. Did you get the results back on our patient Cherkaoui? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's pretty localized. I think we'll start with something normal. OK., we'll to try to send him to you for a consultation this afternoon. Yeah, OK. How's your mother? We got the initial results. No surprise: it's an aggressive relapse. I went to see her. She didn't seem too bad. Compared to the day before yesterday, it's good. She's come a long way. Yeah, I talked to her a bit. We should be able to start another treatment. The problem is, it's pretty resistant. We tried lots of medications. Some therapeutic options remain, but not many. If we could operate, it would be simpler. -Feterman is not at all for that. -Feterman... That can change. Feterman won't refuse an opportunity to play hero. Hello Mr Cherkaoui. Hello. The doctor and I wanted to see you because we received your latest test results. You probably guessed it, the analyses confirm our fears. The dark area in your lung is... It's cancer. We checked to see if it had spread to other areas. It appears that no vital organs have been affected. We may have identified small nodules developing, but nothing serious. On the bright side, now that we know what it is, we can treat you. OK. The good news: you won't have to have surgery. It wouldn't be useful for the time being. So we won't bother you with that. We'll send you to oncology. We know them well. They'll take good care of you. You can trust them. You'll have to start treatment. First radiation and probably a bit of chemo. It may not be much fun, and it takes a while, but it may well work. 8, 16, 27. Where do I put my Scrabble now? -Could you give me a bit of water? -Yeah. Still drinking lots? Yes, my mouth is dry. Thank you. To avoid losing, do you know what they use? No idea. They talked about giving her a real meal. -Maybe tonight. -A yoghurt to start with. That's good. Next week, I'm taking her to lunch in Vincennes. -Drink. -That's a little fast. Apparently it'll be nice out. Mom, you're much better, but you still can stand up on your own. I went from here to the chair. Are you going to play or what? Hey. I don't know what to play. Yeah. Come in. How's your mother? Good, well, a little better. I spoke to Adjadj. It might not be as bad as we thought. I think an intervention could kick-start the treatment. Yeah, he trusts you entirely. He says you've fixed much worse. He'd be surprised if you didn't accept the challenge. If she's doing better, that's a good thing. We'll see what we can do. I can't promise you, but I'll go see her. I'll go see her early next week. -OK., thanks. -Your welcome. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday Gladys ! Happy birthday! There's no number, right? We don't talk about that. Yes. You even got me a present? Fred chose it. -What is it? -A little leopard. Exquisite. Fred, I'm impressed. She has to try it on. Exactly the... Very well chosen. -Isn't he funny. -Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Let me give Caro a hug. -Thanks a lot. -Here, Gladys. -You OK? -Yeah. Incredible. It never ends. Thanks. -What for? -Earlier, with Cherkaoui. -I don't know what came over me. -It's ok. My mother's doing better. They might be able to operate. -A toast. -You never quit. Come on, have a drink. Stop, that's enough. There. Cheers. To you. To you. -It's good to see like this. -How? Smiling. Oh, you want to fight. You want to box. I'm going to win. Oh, look. You surprised me. There are two of them. Oh no. You won't get me. You won't get me. Come on, it's ready. Nutella crepes. -What did I hear? -Nutella crepes. Nutella. Can they have Nutella? Go on, laugh. At some point, you choose your fights. Look at the mess you made. Come on, let's go. Look, there are holes. It's cripsy. That's the best part. It's good. She gave me her camera, the little one, you know, to film the concert. It's wonderful. As soon as I got out, I send her the video, and she got to see it right away, in her room. But I promised her that she'd be with us next time. That would be good. I saw her surgeon Friday. -Surgery might be possible. -That's wonderful. It's not certain yet, but... You'll see. -You OK? -I don't know. Has anything changed in this room since we were kids? It's crazy. Did you see this photo? His face. And look what I found. How could I forget that. She played us it all the time. I'm getting a divorce. What's wrong? Édouard doesn't know yet, but I've made my decision. It's not new. I've been thinking for ages. I don't know what changed exactly, or when, but I've had enough. Look, today, he's not even here. I don't want this life. And the kids? Ever seen Édouard look after them? It won't change anything for them. He's never here. We won't fight near them and they'll still see him. Are you sure? You won't regret it? I'm sure. It's become obvious the last few days. But it's OK. Did you tell mom? I'm going to this week. Don't worry. I've got to go. Where's dad? He's at the store. -I'm going there. -You're here. I'm tidying up a bit. Rose told me the surgeon is thinking about operating. That's not quite right. For now he's going to see her. Why would he go see her if he's not thinking of something? I don't know, dad. -Did your sister tell you? -Yes, just now. She seems to know what she's doing. I don't know how mom's going to react. Yeah. And you? Your love life? My love life? It's fine, nothing more, nothing new. Any news of Sarah? Dad, that ended four years ago. You guys are weird. I'm the only one who's moved on. Alright, see you. -Bye. -Bye. -How are you? -Good. -Have a good weekend? -Not bad. You're lucky. It was non-stop here. No idea why. The boss just got in. She looks in a good mood. And you're late. You can scroll like that. It's beautiful. -They're wonderful. -Exhausting. -An afternoon is fine. -I couldn't handle more. And how are you? Alright. I'm a little tired. I didn't sleep well because there was noise next door. Otherwise I'm OK. Did you see the intern? The nurses? Did they say anything? Hum. Is your stomach pain any better? It's OK. And Feterman? The surgeon, he was supposed to come see you. Yes, I know, he told me. -I saw him this weekend. -Already. He's already talking of operations. I refused. I don't think I can handle it. -Of course you can. -It's too much for me. What do you mean? We've been through this. You can't give up now. But I don't want any more of this. Do you know what that means? An illness doesn't cure itself. I know. Why did you want me to become a doctor? It's a wonderful job, isn't it? You know your life. It's still important. And everyone needs a doctor. But you're refusing treatment. Simon, I've been spoiled. I've had the life I wanted. What about us? Don't worry. Come here. Don't worry, my boy. You have to reason with her. She's giving up. You know very well it's not like her. I've known her for more than 40 years. It's not her nature. You have to talk to her. -She's never given up on anything. -Now's not the time to start. Hum. What's he doing there? Mr Hamon. Mr Hamon. I'm going home, doctor. Thank you. I think you need to stay. No, I assure you, everything's fine. I'm OK. and my wife's waiting. Do you have permission to leave? You went to admissions? Me and paperwork... You don't seem to get it. You're going to stop causing trouble. Cut the crap. Come up with me and get your fucking x-rays! Take your fucking meds! -He's crazy! -Calm down. Lock that guy up! He's completely insane! My dear Simon, you know what just happened never should have happened. We're not going beat a dead horse. We can't treat unwilling people. This guy has no will. He's crazy. He can't know what's best. You're taking this to heart, which is good. But don't make it a personal matter. Go apologize to him. Make an appointment with him for next week. Have him sign a discharge form and let him go. We're not going to let him ruin our lives. You know very well he won't come back. Sadly we have to make these kinds of decisions every day. But you know what? Next week, I won't be there. It's very simple. Mom's letting herself die. I've not been off in 2 years, so I will now. See you tomorrow. Excuse me, this isn't visiting hours. Did she have a scan recently? I couldn't tell you, I'm sorry. You'll have to ask the doctor. Now it's time for treatment. Excuse me. I thought you were going away with me. What's going on? Mom's stopping care. -I'm sorry. -It's driving me crazy. I need you to help me. Anything, tell me. -Promise me you won't ask questions. -OK. -You... -Don't ask questions. Come on. What's up? I told you mom, we're just going for a walk. -Ok. -Don't worry, everything will be fine, trust me. Let's go. Come on. One, two, three. Are you ok? Here. OK., we're ready. Wait for me here. -Hey. -Hey, you're here as a civilian now? I have to get a scan. My patient's there. Right away? Was it scheduled? No? Oh that's going to be tough. We're booked up here. -Do you have a prescription? -No. -Where did you get that lady then? -ICU. -She's my mother actually. -Oh sorry. This is her file, thanks. Come on. You can wait here. -Hello. -Hello. From now on, don't move, OK? Everything will be fine. OK. So. A bit lower, the heart. No spleen any more, right? -No. -Ah, there we are. The liver is pretty large. -And the... -It's fine, he knows, he's a doctor. Ma'am, it's over. Someone will come get you. I'll do it. There. Alright? Excuse me. I don't get it - why you didn't tell the ICU team. Why haven't they done another scan since the ER? I don't know. Maybe there was no need. Did you find out anything new? What should I have done? Sit and do nothing? Simon, you do realize, you did it for you, not for her. Let me remind you, next semester I'm in the ICU. Starting Monday, I'll be taking care of your mother. I hope you'll have more trust in me. There, hold on. Be careful with that. It's not at all dry. Should we put makeup on your face, too? Why? Do I look bad? Mom, I think we can do better, yes. A little. Nice, it looks pretty like that. And that's good too. The color is very nice. -Nice. -Am I interrupting? No, look, I was just finishing up. -What do you think? -It's great. Mom is beautiful. -I'm going. -Yeah, go on. Give the kids a hug. Bye. I got you some magazines and newspapers. You can put them there. Well. Your sister told me about Édouard. It's for the best. She seems sure and, above all, relieved. I'd rather that than see her unhappy. Édouard was what he was, but I was never a big fan. Really? Me neither, actually. I got really lucky with your father. I want you kids to be happy. I'd like so much to be sure. I'm scared. I'm so scared. I'm terrified. I... -You're going to ruin your makeup. -Yes. -Sorry. -Don't apologize. What happened? She... We were playing and then she nodded off, and then she fell half asleep, and then, she was saying words backwards. -I couldn't understand her. -Calm down, dad. What did they say in the ward? Nothing, I called you right away. -You didn't think to call a doctor? -No. Hello, thanks for waiting for me. Excuse me, have a seat. Well, she's really starting to get tired. She was ill last night, she was restless. She's been getting weaker for several days, and she's deteriorating faster. She's getting confused, incoherent. It all points to her liver being affected. You know what that means. Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. If you need anything, don't hesitate. That's what I'm here for. It's always bad when liver function's affected. Can it be treated? There are antibiotics, yes, but... It won't address the root cause. -She needs her strength back. -Dad, you're not listening. She's not going to. It's over. It won't get better. She's dying. I don't know when, in two days, two weeks, a month, but what's for sure is that... she won't get better. -Hello. -Hello. I'd like to rent a DVD for a patient. Ok, I need: ward, room number, last name, first name, ID and a 40 euro deposit check. Room 15, ICU, and it's Mrs Checkin. But I don't have ID or a check-book with me. We need it for every account. I'm a doctor here. I'm sorry, but without a check and ID, I can't help you. Ok, forget it. Have you had any pain since we removed the probe? No, not really. Have you managed to eat a little or is it still difficult? -No, I still can't. -Ok. This young lady just told me what a good doctor she thinks you are. -Really? -Yeah, it's true. She said that for you. It worked. Let me know if you need anything. -Thank you. -See you later. -She's lovely. -Yeah. I saw Sarah earlier in the hall. She's pregnant. I know. How? You know we... We kept in touch. We met a few times. I think she wanted to tell you herself. Kids, don't run, come here. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. You must speak softly. You can't shout in a hospital. Why, what will happen? -Where's grandma? -A little further. Don't make noise, we're not allowed to be here. You can't stay long. -Why can't we be here? -I'll tell you later. -Got them? I'll be back. -Yeah. Come with me. We're going sit here. What's your name? I'm OK. Would you pass me the shawl, please? -This one? -Yeah. Around your neck. Do you know... Do you know who bathed me today? -No. -Men, young guys. -So what? -They could have done anything. -What are you saying? -Some of them like old ladies and maybe I'd have liked it. Oh, I've made you uncomfortable. Are you ready? I'm going to call them in. Are you sure? Yes. -The pendulum, the treasure... -You're going too fast. If we add... Do you know what this is? No, but it's beautiful. It's a moon-owl. Really? Will you make me another? Where will you go when you die? I'll be in your little heads. You won't forget me. I'll be in there. And in your little brother's too, perhaps a little less. When you think of me, I'll be there. Always, OK? Will you draw me another picture? Here, look, make it fly. Doctor Checkin. -Hello. -Hello. Thank you doctor. He's coming home. He had his first chemo session. It went well. Good, how do you feel? A little tired, but alright. I'm not complaining. If I need chemo, I'll do the chemo. You're right. We just wanted to thank you, doctor. -Goodbye, doctor. -Goodbye. -Thank you. See you soon. -Get home safe. -Dad, you should get some rest. -No, it's OK. Yes, I'll take over now. Go take a shower, have a nap, -drink a coffee, I don't know. -OK. I'll stay here. See you in a bit. Do you want some water? Here. Careful. Easy. Wait, wait. More. Yes, wait. Here. This will be simpler. Open your mouth. More? You're all over. -You OK? -Yeah. Let me know if I can do anything. It's fine. Don't act like I'm not here. I'm treating your mother, so I'm going through this too. Don't think I'm not moved. You've chosen to do this alone. Wheee! -It's coming. -Ice cream. -Careful. -You bought enough for an army. I didn't know what to get, so I got it all. -There's chocolate, lemon, coffee. -Oh coffee. Strawberry, melon, mango. You chose well, Simon. There're even more underneath. He got every flavor. Yes, that's an option. Do you taste the lemon? This one is good. I really like the apricot. Taste the apricot. A little bit. You can really taste the apricot. Go on, go on, it's your turn. Go on. No, not there. Darn it, it's over here. I pass, I dribble. Go on, pass. Make a pass. Great. Be careful will the ball, please. It's fine. Alright, I'll let you play. You can't throw it with your hands. Hey, look. Come see. Did you talk to them? No, not yet. I don't have the courage. It's all too much. And Édouard? What do you think? Obviously, he didn't take it well. That's normal. Actually, I don't care. I don't care at all. -It's strange. -What? -Not to care. -No, it's good. You have beautiful, healthy kids. You didn't score a goal. Do you get these? This one, I don't know, but normally, yes. I'm no good at math. Numbers don't mean it's math. I get why you're bad. Ma and I could never count. She never wanted to count the money. Strangely, she was very good at Scrabble. She's better than you, dad, that's all. Oh stop. Well? She's fine. I even think she opened her eyes. You're tired. Do you want a rest? Figure it out. Listen, Édouard, I don't want to deal with this now... Well, we don't know, actually, we don't know anything. Yes, everyone's here. Simon's here. There you go. We'll talk tomorrow. In any case, no you'll have to cope, you know. I don't want to get upset! What an asshole! Here, have a drink, forget him. Come on. -It'll do you good. -Thanks. You want some, dad? Thanks, Simon. You want a glass? -Thanks. -Here. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I'm almost 15 years older than her. I was supposed to go first. How did she manage to stay so positive? So enthusiastic all the time. She lived for others, you see. Members of her family, they weren't so lucky. To live. To be happy. She owed them that. Here. -Women's magazines. You want them? -Bin them. Oh yes, give me the... -Thanks. -You still had this in the fridge. -Are you hungry? -No. You can keep it for the staff. We've got big eaters here, thanks. -You're welcome. -Bye. Well, we have everything. We didn't forget anything. Thanks. Come on. Hi. What's with the sheet? My mom did that. It's a Jewish mourning ritual. You cover the mirrors in the house for 7 days. She wasn't a believer. She ate pork roast on Yom Kippur, but this she did. Go on, I'll manage. OK, just shut the door behind you. -Hello. -Hello. Oh you're here. I thought I'd never see you again. Nope, I'm back. You're not done with me. I've thought a lot about you, doc. I'm really sorry. It must not be easy. Thanks. And you? I watch series, so I'm alright. Actually, I have lots to tell you. OK, I'll be back to bother you a little later. -Hello. -Hello. Simon, Simon, her oxygen's desaturating, we're losing the kid. We must re-use the bag. We tried 4 times, it's not worked. Move. Move! Move the bed. Easy. Come on. Here. Tell me when I can do it. Are you ok? Is she dead? You were just in time. She's in for another round. Subtitling: Hiventy.
