Mark my word, you're gonna force me to kill you, baby. I don't wanna do that! Now just take it. Come on, you know you want it, don't you? Aw, come on, come on! - No! - You can do it! Come on! # Love slave, love slave, love slave # Melanie, have you seen Bonnie? - Yeah, she went out back about 10 minutes ago. Jesus. Just drop the gun now, Miss. Oh my god. Miss, can you hear me? Drop it! It's okay. - God, what happened? - I don't know. Nancy heard the shot. That's Danny Hanson's kid. Who's the girl? - I don't know, I've never seen her before. I think she's one of the movie people. She has a gun, she shot him. Bonnie Cusak? Regardless of the justification, you cannot take the law into your own hands. The jury's found you guilty of second-degree manslaughter. You are hereby sentenced to a term of two years. Order, I'll have order in the courtroom. And remanded to the custody of the State Correctional Authority. Try not to freak out, Bon. We're doing everything we can to get you outta here. I didn't mean to kill him. I know, baby, I know. Times up, Miss. Don't let them keep me in here, Laurie. I won't. I love you, Bonnie. I love you, too. Hello, bunnies. Incoming prisoners. - Right this way, ladies. - There to control. Let's go, move it. Watch your feet. Okay, open it up. - Nice little. - Ow! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch! Woo, yeah! Give me tooth decay, baby! - I see you, mama. - Yeah, oh! Oh my god, hey. Light and juicy, what are you in for? Yeah, someone's comin' up for you. Now you, I know what it is you want. You're for the same things. - Hey grandma. - Ha, check it out. Check it out. Woo! - Come on, Kay, show those muscles! Woo! Hey, no, no, no. Ivory country, out. You too, bye. Peach pickin' time. Hey honey pie, lookin' for this? Oh! - Okay. I'd like to shower alone. Oh sure, babe. We got plenty of time to get acquainted. I'm Kay. I'm the boss. I be the big bad wolf. Yeah. - You and me, we're gonna be real good friends. - Woo! - All right! Shut up! - Yeah! - Listen, you. You're off to a bad start. Little respect keeps you healthy, short stop. You're a long way from home, Goldilocks! Okay, okay. Okay. What's this all about? - This girl is a real troublemaker, Miss Dice. She just attacked me, look! What's your name? Bonnie Cusak. Brown, take Cusak to the ward's office. Butler, I want your mops in 20 minutes. Yes, Miss Dice. Is that the girl out there? Yes. Doesn't look like a troublemaker to me. Please sit down, Cusak. Cusak, this is a prison, not an ice hockey rink. You can't just start punching anyone who happens by. I didn't do anything. Then why was her lip bleeding? - I don't understand what's happening to me. I just want everybody to leave me alone. - I'm sure this all seems very strange to you. But you're just going to have to blend in and make the very best of the situation. I've assigned you to prison laundry. Now try and stay out of trouble, okay? You can go now. - Let's get these dangerous implements put away, eh? Listen, I'm gonna come see you tonight. Like you did last night? Ah well, last night I had some trouble with the wife, but- - Sure. - Might as well take a shower. Clean up, will ya? Lock it up, will ya? Later. So there's this cockatoo, you see? And all the bird does is crap and talk, crap and talk. So finally I pick up this tennis racket, start to bash the bird's brains out. Then he goes crazy, runs me all around the room. I aced him, pff. Well, that's why I'm here. I figure if I gotta be here, I might as well make the place look pleasant, huh? Hey, what do you think if I put a sign outside that says Sylvia's Fluff and Fold? Just 'cause it's a prison doesn't mean it has to be cold? - Believe me, there's nothing cold about this place. - Yeah, we're up to our necks in hot water. Get it? You're a crack up. We're certainly not pressed for time. You're a crack up. I'm finished, Sylvia. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow. So for a bunch of criminals, we're not so bad, huh? Things'll lighten up. Hey, you wanna smoke? Best shit that's been around in ages. They say it's from Taiwan. What if we get caught? So let 'em arrest us. Where do you get it from? Kay's got connections. She takes care of everybody, you know? So get on her good side. Workin' late, eh? What do you got the iron goin' there, Sylvia? Wouldn't want a fire, though. Such a kidder, Kay. Well, Miss Cusak. Did you get over your first day jitters? - Look, why don't you leave her alone, she's cool. Shut up, get out! You're history, Goldilocks. Get outta here. Outta here. Shut up! Twat face! Get her, Bobo! Oh, I've got her now. Wanda! Ah! - Get her! - Ah! Ah! Star, come on! Star! - Yeah! - Star, let's see you! Aw honey, you did good. Let's see you grow big, huh? Shoot her up. Go watch the door. Nighty night, Goldie. You just had your last date with the three bears. Dump her. Sayonara, sweet lips. This is it, honey. Yeah. That was great, definitely, yeah. - Mr. Manning, you're wanted on the set. Works over here. You hit the bag off center. Yeah, give me a break. Almost gave yourself a break. - Great fall, Laurie, you have a phone call. It's urgent, over here, come on. Okay, that's it. Next set up. - Who is it? Hello? Yeah, this is Laurie Collins. Laurie, they want another one honey. They need you now. What's wrong? It's Bonnie. Bonnie's dead. Suicide! With those bruises? Did you do an autopsy? Well yes, of course. Well then get another one! - As far as this office is concerned, Miss Collins, the case is closed. Closed? It was never open! I have sworn affidavits from the warden, the associate warden, the coroner, and the head trustee. Not one conflicting report. Suicide from overdose complicated by fall. Miss Collins, is it Collins or Cusak? - I go by Collins, it's my professional name. Did you see the bruises, Mr. Watson? Fall from a building, and you die. You don't bruise, you die. I'm really sorry. It's a tragic thing that happened. But an accusation of murder without any evidence whatsoever? You can take this to the Superior Court. They order the case reopened. I'll be happy to look into it. David, welcome aboard. David Green, Paul Donahue. How you doin'? - Paul, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Look, everything is going to be fine. Just let me do all the talking, all right? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Okay, let's go. - Okay. - Your Honor, the only witness is a prisoner, and yet no one questioned her account of the incident. Now routine suicide in the outside world is always investigated by homicide. I know I don't have to tell you that, Judge Fliar, but. You see, we're not looking for special treatment. On the contrary, we wish to be treated typically and be given the chance to acquire the information we know is waiting safely for us behind those prison walls. - Mr. Green, I'm well aware of your reputation, but I'm not impressed by your Beverly Hills rhetoric. Nor do I feel inclined to discuss the case until court convenes on Monday. I've had it with your legal bullshit. My sister is dead because of it. No! We're taking this to the press. The press prints news, Ms. Collins. It is not news that drug addicts die in prison. Good day. - Drug addicts? - Laurie. - Yeah, well we'll just see about that, won't we? - Come on. - Come on, let's go. Yeah, thanks. What's up? Oh, they upheld the coroner's reports. Baby. I am really sorry. But we're gonna have to put all this behind us and get on with the rest of our lives. And we have tried everything, there is nothing else you can do. Is that right? Just watch me. I seem to have misplaced my ticket. The white Lincoln. Of course, ma'am. Hey, look. Is that the car? Oh wait, just- Well, thank you ma'am. Drive carefully. - Mm-hm. Hey, who was that? - I don't know, some lady with a 20 dollar bill. God damn it, shit head! That was Judge Waters's car! God damn! You know, they always say the first bottle tastes the best, but I think the second bottle tastes even better. Roger, 211 to 527 Main. Coming right at Fifth. Understanding that seven also responding. Go for it, fellas! We're goin' for a ride! Check it out. - Yeah, a blonde in a hot rod Lincoln. We're cookin' now! Woo! Tryin' to keep up with little old me! Okay, ah! - Unit three, say your location, over. - Out of the car, lady. - Roger unit three. Well, it's about time! - Unit three, proceed to 57 Main. - You guys are awful slow. Come on, lady let's go inside. - How'd you like that, pretty good, wasn't it? I do that for a livin'. - Laurie, you know you don't have to go through with this. Now the judge should've disqualified himself. Just say the word, and you can walk out of here. No, I'm going for it. All rise, face the flag. The Honorable Judge Waters is now presiding. This court is now in session. Laurie Collins. I hereby fine you $8,000 for damages and I sentence you to 12 months in State Correctional Authority. However, it is the opinion of this court that these acts were not done in malice, but rather from a deep, emotional stress. Sentence suspended. You son of a bitch. What did you say? You call yourself a judge? This trial has nothing to do with justice. You fine me $8,000 and tell me to go home? Well no problem! What about the crimes against human lives - Bailiff! - Who pays for those? I hereby revoke that suspension. Your sentence will begin immediately! Take her out of here, now! She's got some friends. Yeah, they're a bunch of guys. Look at the blonde one down there. How you doin'? - Kay's gonna get it tonight. New fish are here. Fresh off the ice. Holy mackerel. - Slice 'em up. - That's good. You look beautiful, Kay. All dressed up and no place to go, huh? Are you kiddin'? I got me 10 inches of the Italian stallion waitin' for me. - Yeah, ride 'em cowboy. - Yeah! - Come on! - What do you got? I'll find somethin'. - Stick around for the freak show. - Don't hit the scale, don't hit the scale. How's it going there? So far, so good. That's what I wanna hear. Hey Willis! Warm up those wheels! I'm hot to trot! Mama! Don't wait up, baby. Keep your hands clean, or you're gonna end up being sushi by the time I get home. Oh, Kay is pissed man. Goodnight, darling. Butler, 39011. Out visit. Butler, report to Control. Lookin' good. White milk. - That that'd be worth going to prison for. Forget it, she's mine. You're the greediest bitch. You say that to all the girls. - Incoming prisoners, third to Control. Come on, let's go. I got ants in my pants, and I need to dance. - I think you're gonna enjoy the facilities. Back there was the carpool. Over here is the mess hall. Best gourmet food this side of the Mississippi. Down here is your little house, beautifully furnished. Thank you, this way. So, uh, I understand you're in showbiz. Yeah. So who told you that? - Oh, you know, what good friends say. Oh really? What movies did you make? # One # # You are the one I # Hey man, what is this shit? Nelson, this is a brown cell, man. I can't have this gringa shit in here. What are you tryin' to set me up for murder, or what? People are gonna start gettin' hurt around here. I'm telling you. - Eh, nobody's gonna get hurt around here. Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? - Make yourself at home, sweetheart. Have a good day. Yeah, right. I'm Laurie. Look, as long as I'm here, we might as well be friends. I know it's not your fault, okay? It's just skin. But I don't like the way you smell. So stay on your side. Okay. No problem. All prisoners, code orange, modification seminar in 10 minutes. - Keep your pecker in your pocket, big boy. Hey, hold on. I'm not finished yet. This is a job, Gino, not a joyride. You know, we could be makin' big bucks off these conjugal visits. If we were organized. Most of these bitches were working girls before they got set up. You're unbelievable, Kay. Always lookin' for a man to hunt. - All right, Kay, come on, time's up. Shut up, Willis, or you don't get any. Where is it? Well. That's it. Mama loves you, baby. Now you see it. Now you don't. This is a prison for profit, and you will be expected to carry your own weight and be a productive part of our society or you will be penalized in time and privileges. Now you'll work at a regular job and be paid 6.50 per hour. From that will be deducted room and board, laundry, and monthly payments on your fines. Whatever you have left is yours to spend or save as you like. - You will be issued a dark blue uniform after two weeks. Trustees where light blue. If you prove to be a discipline problem, then you will be issued an orange jumpsuit. Ward Haines will give you your assignments. Laurie Collins, this way, please. Well, Ms. Collins, felony drunk driving, grand larceny, grand theft auto. Hm. Well, since you like cars so much, let's start you off at the motor pool. Okay. If you keep your nose clean, it'll turn out to be a pretty good job. Okay, that's all. Know anything about GM V-8s? Yeah. Okay, hey Willow. New girl Laurie, Laurie, Willow. Hi. Yeah, I need more brazing rod. - Yeah, you wanna go check with Kay about that. Don't take a lot around here. There's a beautiful engine, what can you do with that, huh? Don't pay no attention to that. Drugs. Late payment, I'd say. Well shouldn't we do something? I wouldn't, if I were you. Those dykes'll chew you up for dessert. A lot of people get killed around here? A lot of people die. They call it suicide. Did you know Bonnie Cusak? Who are you, a cop? Don't make waves, huh? Just keep your nose clean. Aren't you scared? What are they gonna do to me? I've been down 30 years. So what are you in for? Eh, killed my husband and his mother. They deserved it. And I enjoyed it. Can I ask you a question? Anything you want. - Why are you always playin' with your night stick? - Would you like to play with my night stick? How you doin', sweet cheeks? I'm okay, pal. Maybe later, huh? I'll see you two around. - Boy, that Nelson sure has a lot of energy for a white boy. - And he's ready to rock you and let you down. Hi. China. It's Wednesday, Amy. You got anything for us? I'll have it for you tomorrow. Some of my customers are behind. - Give her two more bundles on credit. - Kay, you know I'm tryin' to quit that shit. Look, once I collect for my customers, I'm through! Thanks, but I'll pass this time. Here's your brown, Amy, your favorite. Please, no! It's yours. Make some sales with the sisters. Kay, I don't want it! What are you lookin' at? Once you go brown, there's no turnin' around. You're gonna come crawlin' back. - All right, ladies, get up, it's shower time. Get your asses up, let's go. Wednesday, May 15th. A revised work roster begins today. Changes are as posted. Hey Collins, let's hit the showers. - Prisoners Dunn 15312 and Chang 46027 are now code orange. I have personal posts for Elanie, Pegman, Mandel, Taylor, Ramirez. Prisoners should report to control after 10:30 hours. Hey. How you doin', sweetheart? Softball game today at seven. What do you think, Nelson? At least they let you outta here at night. - I think I got a solution to your problem. I'm not interested. - Well, I uh, just tryin' to make your stay more enjoyable. - Bitch, give me my shirt! - Fuck you, whitey! Uh-oh, trouble at the office. Check out my references. Table for two, Louie? - Hey, you got the wrong table, black trash! Kiss my ass, you spic! You're asking for trouble. Honk honk, Chung King. So, how are my little chickadees? What's with the doom and gloom? What's up? I'm short almost two grams. - What the fuck are you sittin' here for, go recheck it? We did. - Well you got 24 hours to fix it, or it's on you, Wanda. Here you go. What's with this bloodbath? Cool it, Wanda, that one's mine. Well I'm sorry. Kay runs everything around here. I mean, everyone depends on her in one way or another. Hasn't anyone ever tried to stop her? Have her and not them. - Hey I'm gonna go get a milk, I'll be right back. Oh will you get one for me, too? She's a nice girl. - We don't trust Sylvia, babe, she's a snitch. Hi. Lockdown, three minutes. Hey Sylvie, come here. Come on. - Ouch. - Want somethin'? Take a seat. - Come on, come on. - We'll have a little talk. We have a question for ya. Yeah? We were just wonderin' if you had seen anyone stealin' any of our dope. No, I haven't. Wasn't you, was it? No Kay, I wouldn't do that. You wouldn't be that stupid, would you? No, I wouldn't do that, not at all. Kay, you know me better than that. I tell you everything, you know me better than this. I didn't do it, Kay. I didn't do it, you know that. I know who did it. I know, I do, I know who did it, I'll tell you. Are you tellin' the whole truth and nothin' but the truth so help your Adam's apple? I swear, I'll tell you! Why do you keep doing this to yourself? I need a fix! I need a fix! I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay. Let me help you. I love you. Yeah? You love me? In the fucking closet. - Black and brown don't mess around. But I need you! Aw, ain't this cozy? Just like a Norman Rockwell painting. What is this, lickety split hour? What the hell do you want? - Look, if I wanted shit from you, I'd pick your teeth. - Hey! - Tuck it in, Pocahontas. Pull her off! No, no! No! Baby! Can't handle your own bullshit? - No, no! - Way it works! I never took without pay! Stop it, no! No! What are you gonna do? Don't shit the shitter. Kay no! What do you want? Nobody rips me off! Kay no! No! No! No! One, two. How many do you want? - You're the dealer, you can't turn me down. Give me some cards, douche bag. No. Give her three. Okay. - Okay. - Yeah, what you gonna bet? Hey Kay. Amy didn't steal nothin' from you, man. You shouldn't have done that, bitch. You play with fire, you get burned. That's the way it goes. You turned her hand into dog meat. - What, do you got an itch you can't scratch? You shouldn't have done that. Ooh. Talk about re-fried. Ooh, a fight. Come on. Come on! Come on! Jump up, jump up! Go, go! What's that? Go, come on! Fucking. Let me conga. I've had enough! You're gonna back off! Call 'em off! Don't! Don't. Curtains to you, Bambi. How you doin'? A few busted ribs is all. They treatin' you okay? - How the fuck you think they're treating me? Like shit. You got a cigarette? No, sorry. Look. Don't expect no big thank you from me. She's gonna get you for this. Kay doesn't scare me. You're really stupid. Since I've been here, I've had to watch three of my sisters carried outta here like they was trash. Yeah, well that's the problem. If everybody got together, then nobody would have to put up with scum like Kay. Did you know Bonnie Cusak? Yeah. I heard you've been askin' a lot of questions. It was Kay. You know. And the rest of the gang. Thanks. Hey. Who is this Bonnie Cusak anyway? My sister. Come on, over here, put it down. Hurry, come on, hurry' Now go over there and work on the windbreaks, okay? Move, go. What are you doin' here? You killed Bonnie Cusak. Aw, come on. Oh come on? You killed her. And I wanna know who helped you. Yah! Yah! No! Yah! Get up! Ah, get up now! Drop the knife! Name who! Name, now! Kay? Bobo. China, Star. You killed my sister. Wanda! Industrial accident, my ass. Somebody killed her. Who do you think did it? How the fuck do I know? Could've been one of the hocks, could've been one of the niggers, could've been anybody. Damn well find out! Stupid fuckheads, you never get anything straight. Hey Willow, what's going on here? You think I'm stupid or what? Shut up, Kay. Get your goons outta here. Who's tellin' me to shut up? Time's up. Paul. I found out who killed Bonnie. And I've already killed one of them. You did what? Achieving honorable justice. That's Bushido. No Laurie, that's bullshit. You take away the swords and that Oriental mumbo jumbo, and what you have left is revenge. Murder. My god, we gotta get you outta there. You're changing, and I don't like what you're becoming! Well, what do you expect? I'm not some cryogenic fuck that warms up every time you come jammin' around. I've already killed one of them, and I'll get the others. Jesus Christ, Laurie, you need help! Save your time and money, Paul. Don't come back again. 'Cause I won't see you. 2200 watch, report to Control. 2200 watch, report to Control. Hey, where you goin'? - There's a circuit breaker out in block I, Rosie told me to fix it. We wouldn't want all that gourmet food to spoil, would we? I should say not. I understand you gave up your conjugal visits with, uh, what's his name, Monihan? Remember what I told you. Give me a fuckin' break, Nelson. I do make house calls. China! What the hell are you doin' here? You're next. What are you talkin' about? Yah! Ha! Ah! - My investors are gonna scream bloody murder when they hear about this. You are responsible for security. Sir, a woman has been murdered, and you're worried about investors. Mrs. Dice, may I remind you this institution is a business, and we are paid a fixed fee for every healthy prisoner? - And there's been seven deaths since January. Things are not going to get better until your head trustee and your band of hooligans are diffused. The cars run this prison. If we pull Butler out, there'll be total chaos, and everybody will be vying for top spot. Now get this place cleaned up, and let's get on with the day. Hey! You know why I'm here? To take a shower? You remember the little blonde that jumped off the fourth tier? Aw come on, give me a break. I heard you gave her a little push. Bitch! Ah! I'm gonna kill you! Ah! - Do you wanna tell me what's going on here? How do I know? I know you know what's going on. This makes number three. Shut up! Who's going to be next? Hey gringa, cool it. You're keeping me awake. Sorry. Scary, ain't it? What? Havin' that murderer loose in here. I know who did it, though. She's my cellmate. I can't do it anymore. Yeah. The thrill is gone, huh? Makes me sick. Move over. No, don't worry, I'm not gonna touch you. Laurie. This is a prison. You can't just pick up your marbles and go home. Well, I gotta get outta here. What do you think I should do? All you got is time. But I'll tell you one thing. When they come sniffin' around here, we'll be waiting. Pull! Could be an interracial struggle for control of the drug trade. Pull! But my guess is Laurie Collins. Pull! Collins? Pull! Bonnie Cusak was her sister. Have her shaken down immediately. Pull! Okay girls, gotta check out your room. - All right, let's out to the rail, let's go. Why? - Let's go, out! - You never stop. - Come on, let's go out. - Get outta my stuff, man. Who the hell do you think you are, man? What do you think I got in there? Lethal toothbrush, right. - All right, let's go here. - Oh, come on, now. That feels good. - Little tight in the shoulders today, huh Kay? Uh-huh. - You know, I can make you feel good like this all the time. - No kidding, I coulda told you that. Just get my neck a little higher. - Most people don't get this kind of treatment, Kay. You are really special. Will you shut up? Jesus Christ. Get off. - Gringo, gringo, you're a bad lay, man. Oh, you know it, too. Look at him. Hey, what's going on up there? Why are you doing this? Somebody win the lottery, or what? Dice is leanin' on Collins. Who do you think you are?
