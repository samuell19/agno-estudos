Anyway , as we go through, you'll see a ballroom which has a stained glass ceiling not to be believed. In these very halls roamed most of the greatest minds and names of the 20th century. And their spirits still roam, witness to this great opportunity that we bring. [applause] [Justine laughing] Amazing, huh? Good to get out of that basement. You're going to love this. Come on. Emily Ashley. She won the Academy Award for her first film. It was in here, right in that bed. She got in bed, drank a bottle of champagne, broke the empty bottle, and cut her wrists with the shards.

It might motivate their next move. I find it puzzling that they're willing to wait for Larry King. If they truly wanted headlines, why not make use of the press that's already here? Okay, so-- so, your next move is what? Well, with all the booby traps, it's slow going for the assault teams. So, uh, we wait, talk it out. What do you mean, "talk it out"? How do ya-- how do ya talk it out? Well, it's likely that they're monitoring a police radio that they stole during the kidnapping. But I thought they said they would only talk to Charlie. Well, maybe we can make contact, get them to listen to you. Woodall! Bring me the police radios. Excuse me, has it occurred to anyone that, uh, they've already heard all of this on the radios? The FBI has its own high band, secured channels. The terrorists are on the local police channels. Now, despite what you might believe, Mr. McCurdy, we do have some idea of what we're doing here. Okay. Mister McCurdy? Something I can do for you, Agent Hopkins? You can keep your mouth shut, Mr. McCurdy. Next time you talk to the press, I'm going to have you arrested for obstruction. You got that? What does this mean? Nothing, nothing. Well, what did you do, Miles? Robert, nothing. The-- the press grabbed me, and I spoke to the people about how much you appreciated this... support in this time of need. No. That's all, I wasn't-- Miles, Miles, don't make this into a campaign platform, okay? Don't make it into anything. [whispering] Logan. Logan. Psst, Higgs. What took you so long? Getting a gun for you. I'm coming with you. Here's your light. Here's your weapon. Let's go. Charlie doesn't even like you. I don't think that matters now. Oh, man. Oh, it stinks down here. [pipe clanging to ground] [indistinct radio chatter] What is that? Could mean three trip wires. Could mean anything. I don't understand. The Cong. They set so many booby traps, they-- they couldn't remember where they all were, so they put little reminders up. How do you know all that? 'Cause I was there and I'm still here. Ah... trip wire number one. Yep. I see it. Trip wire number two. Yeah. I got it. No! [explosion] [sputtering, panting] It was a spider web. Yeah. They don't play fair. They started out with trip wires, and then they-- they put 'em up. Boss. Where was that explosion? We don't know yet. We tried to contact him on the original channel. We know he's there. He could be listening. Just still no response. Keep trying. [hovering helicopter outside] [radio static] Boss! Someone's keying the mic. All right, Mr. Sinclair, you try to get them to talk to you. Come on. Um... uh, this is Robert Sinclair. Hello? Hello? Kenny! Uh, Kenny. Use the name Kenny. Hello, Kenny? Are you there, Kenny? That's me. Uh, Kenny, yeah, this is Congressman Sinclair. I would like to speak with my daughter. [radio static] Someone's talkin' to me. Who is this? This is Congressman Sinclair. Hello? Hello? Hello? Where's my money? Where's Larry King? Uh, Larry King is coming. But it's going to take some time. And, the money... [Flynn] Quit stalling. You get me Larry King, or your family goes out the window. Stay off the radio. [indistinct radio chatter] Uh, Charlie One, we have no residue at impact site. [indistinct radio chatter] You know where we are? Not exactly. What's that mean? Hand me the bucket It means, hand you the bucket? Hand me the bucket! Oh. Ah! Charlie One, uh, you got any measurement on propel distance and visual-- Logan. Come in, Logan. We're a little busy right now, Captain. Higgs, what the hell are you doing up there? Here, it's for you. Stand by, Captain. We'll get back to you. Possibly fragments of some steel panels. Could be nearing point of origin, over. Just for a second, I would just like to talk to my daughter. Her name is Justine. Kenny? Are you there? I-- let me talk to my daughter. I'll have to ask Flynn when he comes back. Flynn. Flynn, all right, somebody run the name "Flynn." Come on, let's go. Keep him talking. Kenny, please, just for a second. I just want to talk to my daughter. Uh, talk to me for just a second. Flynn told me not to. I would like to speak with my daughter. I'll have to ask Flynn when he comes back. Kenny, please. I just want to talk to my daughter. Her name is Justine. Okay. I-- I didn't know he was your daddy. Is he a good daddy? Most of the time. I had a good daddy. Daddy? Hi, baby. Oh, how are you? Are-- are you okay? Yeah, we're okay, Daddy. Well, that's good. Is Susan okay? Yeah, she's okay, Daddy. Well, now, we're doing everything we can, all right? I love you, honey. Just come get us, Daddy. Come get us. I'm trying, honey. I'm doing everything I can. [door opening] Kenny! What in the hell are you doing? Justine? Justine? You started this war. Now I'm gonna end it. No. Okay, I-- I-- I'm having trouble understanding you. [radio static] Okay, will you please, please talk to me? There's, I don't know, something wrong with this, this is fading. I know. I can't hear ya. [radio static] Don't wanna hear ya. Try a different channel. Tell him to go to seven. Okay, we're having difficulty understanding you, so would you please switch to channel seven? Would you please go to channel seven? [Higgs] Okay. We've made it up to the third floor. Logan says these guys are tunnel rats from 'Nam. Logan also says that they were crazy when they got out. Will you get off of that damn thing? We'll get back to ya. Who the hell is that? Who's on that channel? Huh? Last transmitting station, identify yourself, and stay off this freq. Liars. You're in my ballpark now, Mr. Logan. Mr. Flynn. Mr. Flynn! Are you there? Hello? Hello, Mr. Flynn? Kenny? Kenny... how do they know my name? Somebody else is in the building. Who? We've got an assault team on the way up there. They're on a high security frequency. We're on the local police band. [sighing] Find Waters. [distant sirens, helicopter] Can-- can I have some gum? What? Gum. Uh, you have some in your purse. Uh, sure. You can have some gum, yeah. Are they gonna kill us? We're gonna be all right, Justine. I am so sorry. For what? I've treated you so badly. I'm sorry, too. I'm never gonna ground you again. [laughing nervously] You won't have to. I'm going to ground myself. Oh, you better pick an understanding husband, because I'm never going to let you out of my sight. Okay. I will. It-- it's good you listen to your momma. I-- I don't have a momma. I'm sorry. Want-- want some gum? Uh, that's a negative, still working on it. Hampered by the rescue team securing the safety of... Bound up, mic. Bound up. Uh, roger, Charlie One. Uh, stand by. T.O.C. says there's a wild card in the building. Repeat, there's a wild card in the building. I hope he's not a friendly, boss, because he'll get wasted. Waters... did you send somebody in there? No. Interfering in a federal investigation is a felony. It's Logan McQueen, Charlie Duffy's old partner. He's crazy. But if I was in there, I'd want him sent in. And if you knew him, you'd feel exactly the same way. So why don't you get smart and try to figure out some way to help him? Let me tell you something, if he does something stupid in there, we're going to have to kill him ourselves. I got a team in there too, pal. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I just hope he doesn't have to stop them from doing something stupid. Found the mayor's aide at the end of this corridor. Oh, yeah? Pick it up, bound up. We've got three floors to go. Great. Up. They're cold-blooded killers. They're trying to kill people. Yeah. Grenade! Aah! Oh, that's close. [indistinct radio chatter] Let's go, go, go! [officers shouting] We're not alone. If he didn't know where we were, he does now. Come on. [indistinct radio chatter] Man, this place reeks of explosives. Must be C4. Yeah, tell me about it. He's close by. I can feel him. Grenade! Ah! Down! Down! Higgs. You all right? No! [Flynn] Hey, Logan. You were there, weren't ya? Yeah. I was there. What's your name, soldier? Corporal. What was your rank? I was a little higher than you. Nobody was higher than me. Aah! Bravo 3-1 to T.O.C. We copy, Team Three. Got another explosion, this time with gunshots, I repeat, with gunshots. Don't know who is who up here. Roger that, Team Three. We're movin' out. Let's go, let's go! [indistinct radio chatter] Where were ya hit? Don't turn me over. Oh. Call in your position. Kenny! [sighing] We need another flyer. She'll do. Susan! No, take me. I'll go. Susan! Please, take me not her. She's just a kid, you coward! Unh! Okay, I'll be quiet. But, please, not her. Take me! Ah! [crying] Kenny, you don't want to see this happen, do you? I know you don't. She's just a child. Take me. Take me, let her go. You'd better hope my father never finds you! You'd better hope you sprout wings, little girl. No! No! Please don't do this. Please! Kenny, do something. Stop him! Stop him! No, Flynn. [Justine] Help me! Flynn, she's too little, no! Focus, Kenny! No! [muffled shouting, crying] No! No, Flynn! Aah! [grunting, fighting] [Justine crying, screaming] Ow! Help me! [gunshots] He's got Justine! Stop, Kenny! Unh! Oh! Here's your gun. I'm going after the kid. [Justine groaning] [indistinct radio chatter] [grunting] I'm on your side. You all right, son? Yeah. I'll call it in. I already have. It ain't so bad. Take my gear. Okay. Oh, come on, there must be a way inside that building without clipping a booby trap. If this Logan can do it... He wants to know who's in there now! The FBI can do it! Excuse me! Mind if we come in? [Susan crying] Ow! It's all right. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's all right, sweetheart. Don't worry. Please, please, please. Excuse me... Robert, I-- I know this is a bad time, but just hear me out for one quick second. You have to understand what a-- a rare opportunity this is... What?! To make some serious political hay. [Susan gasping] I got the profile on Flynn! Here we go. There's an Arlen Flynn with a military record. Military has him listed as MIA in 1971. Computer shows an Arlen Flynn with an arrest record that begins in 1975. Maybe he's not so MIA anymore. Arlen M. Flynn, born 1950, Shreveport, Louisiana. Ah! Let me go. Stop it! You're hurting me. Get! Ow! Rotten brat. Ow! [distant clattering] [Justine] Ah! Please, let me go! Stop! [grunting] [door slamming] [rats squeaking] You're my ticket out of here, honey. Damn! In here! [Justine groaning] [gun drawing, cocking] Corporal, I'm very disappointed in you. These traps are very amateurish for a tunnel rat. Keep talkin', buddy. Make it easy on me. Don't hold back, Logan. Go ahead and scream. I know where ya are. Ouch. That's all you get, Corporal. ♪ And it's one, two, three ♪ What are we fighting for? ♪ Don't ask me, I don't give ♪ A damn ♪ Next stop is Vietnam ♪ And it's five, six, seven ♪ Open up the pearly gates ♪ Well, there ain't no time ♪ To wonder why, whoopee ♪ We're all going to die Ya messed up my plan, Logan. Ya gotta pay. Corporal, it's not too late, you know. I can get you some help. You and I came out of that war all screwed up, partner. Everybody did. The war didn't screw me up. Hell, 'Nam was my education. You think I'm some homeless vet reject like Kenny? I get paid to do this. Really, you got paid? Yeah. Except college boy double-crossed me. I wish he was here. I'd show him. Corporal, I'm coming out. I don't think that college boy meant for you to get out of here alive. Well, I guess we'll both see Mr. McCurdy in hell, won't we? Justine. Are you okay? [coughing] I know some people very anxious to see you. There we go. [indistinct radio chatter] Justine. Justine! Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Are you? You sure? [Susan crying] You've got a mighty strong family, Congressman. Thank you. You're welcome. You also have a fox in the henhouse. Name is McCurdy. Miles? Is that true? Thank you. Ow! [laughter] In other news, instead of declaring his run for the governor's seat today, Congressman Robert Sinclair announced his departure from politics. This on the heels of last night's arrest of Sinclair campaign manager Miles McCurdy. McCurdy is being charged for his role in the kidnapping of the congressman's wife, Susan, and daughter, Justine, a kidnapping that also resulted in the death of aides Ricki Stewart and Eric Gordon. The ordeal is believed to be the design of the misguided McCurdy, in an attempt to gain sympathy and notoriety for Sinclair's candidacy. Also in the news today, accused embezzler Sy Harkin was arrested at the private home of Dr. Lee Chamberis. Harkin was found recovering from gunshot wounds and being treated privately... What? By Dr. Chamberis. Harkin is accused in the embezzlement of nearly $100 million from the Iron Group Mutual Funds Harkin established some three years ago. Bounty hunter, Sonny "Wild Man" Coger, was responsible for the capture of Harkin. Coger, seen here, received the $100,000 reward offered by those who were hoping to find the millions Harkin is suspected of sheltering throughout the world. Coming up next, the latest on the wrath of hurricane Isis. Just how much destruction-- You know, you should-- you should buy me a drink. I saved your life. I saved your life after you saved my life.
