(Haunting music) (Flash bulb popping) (Flash bulb popping) (Flash bulb popping) (Telephone rings) (Telephone rings) (And rings) (Rings loudly) (Answering machine picks up) - [Woman] Good morning Mr. Mochin, this is the doctor's office. Your test results are in and we'd like to see you right away. We'Ve penciled you in for 12. Please let US know if that's a problem. (Water running) (Faucet shutting) (Shufflng footsteps) (Distant shoveling) (Ambient industrial melody) (Elevator button pressing) (Loud crash) -[Woman] Careful with that. (Man laughing) - [Woman] Stop laughing like an imbecile and put it in the corner. (Telephone rings) (Heels walk across floor) (Man laughing) -[Woman] Quiet. (Elevator door opens) -[Woman] Good morning, doctor. Yes, of course. He's just leaving now. I understand. (Train whistles by) - [Shem] The soul, as we'Ve explained, permeates throughout the entire body. And yet an argument regarding which of the limbs serves as the soul's primary location, does exist between the philosophers. -[Bum] (Singing in foreign language) (Train horn) - [Train conductor] Next stop, braintree. Braintree is next. - [Older woman] Excuse me dear, is this seat taken? Such a glorious day. Wonderful for a country outing, is it not? - Sorry? - A private renedzvous for two? Perfect, just perfect. But it is terribly hot on this train. I don't see how you can sit there in that awful coat. - I'm okay, thanks. - But it's like a Turkish bath in here. - I'm fine, really. -Well, have it your way then. (Train rolling on tracks) - [Bum] (Laughing and singing) I imagine you must be on route to meet a sweetheart, yes? A rendezvous for two, no? - I have an appointment. A doctor's appointment. - A doctor? Oh dear. It's nothing serious I hope. - No, no it's just a checkup, a routine checkup. - Thank heavens, you should never trust a doctor when it comes to something serious. Most of them do go to hell after all. (Door creaks) - The doctor will be with you in just a minute. Okay sweetie? (Distorted tenebrous music) (Music builds) (Door opens) - Well, let's see what we have here. So, this is your first visit with US Mr. Mochin? Wait a minute, mochin? Not shem mochin? (Laughs) Well I'll be, it is you. Man alive. It's me. Bentzi. Bentzi spinowitz, the spinster. - Bentzi, sure. Hey. - [Bentzi] Wow, this is some surprise, it's been what, like ten years? - [Shem] Something like that. - [Bentzi] So, talk to me man, how you been? Well, I guess I have the answers to that little quiz. But seriously, tell me what you'Ve been up to. Thought I heard something about you becoming a rabbi? - Yeah, I was studying but... - Oh (chuckles), you married? - No, no I'm not, are you? - Maintaining my mobility old friend. I'm too young to give up on fun. I like my lovin' on the go. We should hand out sometime, I know some sweet places. Women that'll knock that yamaka clear off your head. (Heels clicking) (Knocking on door) - Sorry for interrupting doctor but those packages you were asking about just arrived. - Excellent, good, you can just bring them on in. - Of course. - All right, let's see what we have here. - [Bentzi] Okay. Do you mind if I ask you something a little personal? - I don't think so. - Have you been somewhat depressed lately? - Lately? - [Bentzi] How about work, how's that been going? - I'm not really working at the moment. - [Bentzi] So what do you do all day? - I don't know, I read, study mostly. - Tell me shem, are you active? Sexually I mean. (Heels clicking) - I'm sorry bentzi, but I really don't see what this has to do with my leg. - [Bentzi] Let me put it this way shem. We'Ve all experienced this on some level, right? Let's say someones holding a... I don't know, a faberg√© egg, right? While holding the egg, someone shocks them with some really bad news, heart wrenching stuff. And all of the sudden the hand just goes limp. (Pen clanks on floor) Lifeless. The egg slips from the dead flesh, shatters on the floor like one damn expensive humpty dumpty. -A conversion reaction? You're talking about a conversion reaction. - Exactly shem, that's just it. Only in your case, unlike in our example, the hysterical effects have lingered. But now, for some reason, the past is rearing it's ugly head in the guise of your dead leg. (Heels clacking) - This is crazy, I mean... I've led... My life has been fine, nothing traumatic, nothing like that. You know me, do I seem hysterical to you? - Look, shem, the truth is I've never found much use for this freudian mumbo-jumbo myself. It all smells of witch doctoring and necromancy. As far as I'm concerned, your leg problems and all these so called psychological problems, they can all be traced back to a biological cause. However, we physicians face certain restrictions and currently we have neither the means nor the equipment to perform the necessary tests. So, for the time being anyway, I have no choice but to categorize your case a disease of the mind. (Train rolling on tracks) (Train rolling on tracks) (High heels clicking) (High heels approach) (Train rumbles rythmically) (Train whistles) - [Train conductor] Ticket? Your ticket, sir. - Yes, of course, of course. Just a moment, sorry I've got it here somewhere. - [Train conductor] If you'd please, sir. - I'm sorry but I can't seem to find it. - [Train conductor] A difficulty that may be easily remedied as you may purchase a substitute ticket from me. - Right, but here's the thing. My wallet, where I'd been keeping my ticket, is gone. - [Train conductor] I see. - There was a woman. - [Train conductor] A woman? - Yes, yes a woman, she was sitting right over there. You must have seen her. My bag spilled over near her feet. - [Train conductor] The woman's? - [Shem] Yes, the woman's or... Wait, there was another. - Another? - [Shem] Yeah, an old lady on the train earlier, she held my coat. - And this old woman you say, absconded with your wallet? - And my ticket. (Train brakes screech) (Crickets chirping) (Cane banging) (Car approaching) - Hello. - Well, howdy do stranga? - I'm not... - Out for a bit of a stroll, are we? Nice night for it. - Yeah, well actually i'm... - [Man] Yep. Used to walk up and down this country road just kicking stones and bones, ya know? Now they gimme this here transport cause of my swollen feet. Sure do envy you and your walk, young fella. - Would you like to trade? - A trade? Oh now I get it. A trade. How could we? Unless you got some way of trading up your youth. - I just meant... - Nope. No way no how, can't trade up your youth. Would do nothin' about this here swollen feet of mine. (Laughs) Trade, I tell you. Suppose you take the missus off my hands too. Wait a minute. So that's your game, is it? - [Shem] Game? - You eyeballing my old lady buddy? You're one of them roadside perverts, ain't you? Yeah, that's what you are. Huh, bet you like to cut em up into little pieces, don't ya? Like to hear em scream. - No, god no. I just need a lift, I'm not some psycho. I just... I need some help. - Easy there fella, now that's different. You need help, yep. A stranger in need, in need indeed. What do ya think, sugar pie? Should we help this young fella out? - I won't cause any trouble. - Okay woman, I can handle it. So, uh, where's ya headed? (Car door dinging) Name's Herman. - Shem, shem. Thanks Herman. - Charmed, I'm sure. Shit. (Door slams) (Car engine revs) (Coffin rattles) - [Herman] Tell me something, stranga. Why was you kicked off that train? - The train? Ummm. Did I mention the train? - [Herman] So you saying you wasn't kicked off no train? - No, I just meant that I didn't get how you... Look, my ticket was stolen by some woman who sat down next to me. I'd never seen her before and she... - [Herman] You mean you say you was robbed by a woman? Shit. - Well I can't actually be sure but... - [Herman] Ain't that the end all? I mean there ain't no justice. There you was minding your own business, am I right? When some tramp waltzes in and robs you blind and then they go and throw you off like you was some kind of vagrant. Leave you to die like some... What d'ya call them things? No, that ain't it... One of them... (Man laughing) (Water running) (Box creaking) -[Herman] The shame of it all. It's embarrassment. -[Woman] Sweet. (Film projector running) (Box creaking) (Woman breathing) (Man laughing) (Woman moaning) (Loug bang) (Shoveling) (Dirt landing) (Shoveling) (Crickets chirping) (Dog barking in distance) (Foot dragging) (Distant train horn) (Foot dragging) (Ambient industrial tones) - [Bum] Hey, buddy. Got any dough? - No, sorry. I lost my wallet. (Feet dragging) (Laughing) - Sorry, I lost my grip (laughs). (Sings in foreign language) (Foot dragging) (Elevator button pressed) (Elevator button pressed) -[Super]Well, hello shem, how do you do? - Hey doc, I'm okay. - Still with the doctor business, huh? Enough, my doctoring days are over young man. I've retired to a life of drainage pipes and frozen boilers. Look at my hands. Covered in filth. - Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you about that shovel and the digging? - Well, let's just call that my pet project. The shovel and I are allies in our struggle with the earth. The Clay tends relentlessly towards chaos. So, we must be vigilant. Always work to be done shem and more work after that. Hmm, I see you'Ve acquired an ally of your own. - Oh, this. Yeah, honestly I don't know if it's a friend or a foe. The doctor thinks... - It can't be as awful as all that. - He says it's psychological. - I see, yes... Would you be so kind as to lend an old man a hand? - [Shem] Yeah, sure, of course. - Have I ever told you shem of my great affinity for letters? - [Shem] I don't think so. - They are truly remarkable things. The most basic of all the elements. The stuff of planets and stars, oceans and rocks, of darkness and light. The subatomic ingredients used by god, in his cauldron of creation. The letters hover, suspended somewhere between space and no space. Anchoring all there is to the source of all there is, so we were never set adrift into nothingness. The mind comprehends the letters. The letters expand the mind. The mind moves the body. The body makes manifest tools for the minds exploration. - [Shem] That's interesting. - But these letters are only representations... Signifiers of pure abstraction. It's the meaning behind the letters that give them purpose. Just as you, the soul that is you, is an abstraction that finds expression in your body. This mind shem is inextricably linked to this body. To sever that connection, well young shem, that spells death. Well I thank you for your help shem. Now then, I better rest these old bones. Oh, somewhere I buried a book I think you'd enjoy. Stop by tomorrow and you can pick it up. - Thanks doc, I will. - Make peace with your body shem, and it will be as oil fueling the flame of your soul. (Thunder in the distance) Sounds like rain. Well that's good, it's good for the Clay. Rest well shem and do mind yourself on the stairs. (Thunder crackling) (Footsteps on stairs) (Door slams shut) (Door swings open) (Seductive music pours out) - [Woman] Hi neighbor. - Hi. - [Woman] Shame about the elevator. - Yeah, it is. Did, ah... Did you just move in? (Seductive music) - [Woman] Would you mind coming closer? It's so hard to hear you over the music. - I asked if you'd just moved in. - [Woman] Your name is shem, isn't it? - Shem, yes. How did you know that? - (Laughs) I didn't silly, that's why I asked. - Right. - Well, yes it is. -Tell me something, shem. Are you by any chance dead? - I'm sorry, I thought you said dead. - That's right sweet stuff. You're not dead, are you? - Well, not yet apparently. - [Woman] I put little faith in appearances. And besides, the police seem to think you might be. - [Shem] The police? - [Woman] Detectives, yes. - The police are looking for me? What did they say? - Just that you might be dead. - Was that all? - That's all I can recall. - Well, um... - I guess I'll be going then. - I guess you will. - Right. Should I close the door? - I'm expecting someone. - Right, okay. So, goodnight. (Seductive music) (Light clicks on) (Keys clank on desk) (Thunder crackling) (Eerie droning and rattling) - [Woman] (Moans) Shem. (Door buzzing) (Thunder clap) (Chair sliding) (Lid shifting) (Wind tunnel) (Low tones) (Object kicked) (Thunder clap) (Drawer sliding) - [Bentzi] Okay, shem there is one possibility. It's a long shot, it's still in the experimental stage. (Thunder cracking) - [Bentzi] Cutting edge doctor, real life mad scientist type. (Storm raging outside) - [Doc] The names, the letters. They are the keys of communication between the intellectual and the physical. (Heavy rainfall) To sever that connection, well, young shem, that spells death. - [Benzti] He's been obsessing over proprioception, the whole mind body connection and all that. (Storm raging outside) He's ready to start testing on human subjects. (Wind howling) - [Doc] Shem, I buried a book I think you'll enjoy. (Melodic winds) (Gasps) (Distant shoveling) (Heavy breathing) (Telephone rings) (Telephone rings) (Telephone rings) (Answering machine picks up) (Distorted speech) (Chopin's nocturne no. 2) (Distorted speech) (Chopin louder) (Knocking on door) - [Shem] Hello? Doc? Hello? Doc, it's shem are you home? (Chopin's nocturne no.2) (Nocturne ends) (Footsteps) - Who are you? What are you doing here? - Excuse me, I'm sorry. I live here, in the building. I'm doc's friend, the super, sorry. I came to pick up a book and I knocked but the door was open so I... I'm shem. - So you're the shem that my uncle keeps going on about? Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. Wow, how embarrassing. Were you... Have you been standing there long? - I should have waiting outside, sorry. - Well, where are my manners? Can I get you something to drink? - No, I'm fine, thanks. - I'm in desperate need of a glass of water, so it really wouldn't be any bother. - Okay, thanks. - I thought you looked thirsty, now wait here... No, have a seat, make yourself comfortable and I'll be back in a flash (laughs). (Undertone) This is so embarrassing. (Chopin's nocturne no.3) (Glasses clinking and water running) (Distorted metallic rumbling) Now that's not a man who looks very comfortable. Didn't I tell you to make yourself comfortable? - Sorry, I was just... - Come, let's sit. - Thank you. (Chopin's nocturne no.3) - I'm tiferet, by the way. Do you mind if I ask about your leg? I'm sorry, that was rude. - Oh, my leg, right. No, I don't mind, it's just kind of it's hard to explain, really. You probably... - Right, it's none of my business, I'm sorry. - No, no don't apologize. It's just that it's, it's it's hard for me to... I'm not used to talking with... - Are you always this shy? - Shy? No, I mean... Only around other people. - (Laughs) That's funny. (Laughter) Seriously though. You seem like... - What? - Nothing, it's none of my business. I mean, I don't even know you. - Do you want me to leave? - What? No, of course not. It's just... You seem, well, depressed. Kind of weighed down, like you're guilty of something? I don't know, like you're sitting around waiting for a piano to fall on your head. - Wow, that's, ummm... Really colorful. - I'm sorry, I shouldn't say things like that. I just blurt stuff out sometimes. - No, no it's good to hear it, you know objectified like that, just... Not a piano, you know? Too comical. - (Laughs) Oh, I see, so you're a true tragedian? - Oh, I don't know if I'm truly anything. - [Tiferet] See now, what does that even mean? - Nothing. Sorry, just some... (Train approaching) - [Shem] Nonsense. (Train whistles) (Train rolling) (Box opening) (Flipping through pamphlet) - [Train conductor] (Clears throat) (Struggling with box) Ticket. - [Shem] Of course. - Thank you sir. What is this? - A ticket. - Yes it is, only not for this train. As you can see, we are in the middle of the day. This ticket is for the midnight train. - Is it? I mean, I didn't know there was a difference. - And yet, there is. - [Shem] Is there anything that can be done? - What would you suggest, sir? - Listen, I'm late for an appointment. At least, I think I am. Maybe that's later too. (Telephone rings) - Excuse me. It's for you. - For me? - [Train conductor] For you. - [Shem] Hello. - [Bentzi] Hey, rabbi. What's up? - Bentzi? - [Bentzi] That's right, old pal. - How did you know I was here? - [Bentzi] I have your number, remember? Anyway, Nicole and I are heading out tonight. You should come with US. - Who's Nicole? - [Bentzi] That hot little number from my office. You'Ve gotta remember her. She's great, really wants to hang out. So come on, don't tell me you got something better to do. Shem, you still there dude? - [Shem] Yeah bentzi, I'm here. - [Bentzi] So, what d'ya say? - [Shem] I don't know, where would we go? - [Bentzi] There's this place I heard about just over the bridge, some club or something called the fringes. I hear it's something else. - [Shem] Do you mean the mysterious show? - [Bentzi] Looky, looky even the rabbis heard of it. So, come on it'll be a blast. Hey, mochin, you there? - Yeah, bentzi okay. Let's see what all the fuss is about. (Match striking) (Industrial undertone) - [Tiferet] I want you to dance with me. - [Shem] What? - [Tiferet] Dance with me. - [Shem] Oh, no no, I've never... I don't think i'd be any good at it. - [Tiferet] Oh nonsense, come right this instant. - [Shem] But tiferet, I'm not supposed to... - [Tiferet] Come on, it'll be fun. You can learn a lot about a person from how they dance. Maybe you'll even surprise yourself. - [Woman] (Whispers) Shem. Shem. Shem. (Moaning) (Moaning) Shem. Shem. Sweet shem. - [Nicole] Shem? - [Tiferet] Shem. - [Nicole] Shem? Shem? Shem? Come on shem, it's time to go in. Hey, are you okay? What's wrong with your friend Ben? - He's fine, let's get in, huh? I'm thirsty. (Electric buzzing) (Organ music) - Hey rabbi, wet your lips. - Cool your heels. - Papers. (Loud flames) (Laughter) (Round of laughter) - [Bum] After the planting, she cries. "Oh me, oh my." And burnin', huh (laughs)? - Incarnate protuberance and sloth. (Laughter) - Her dog? He plays surgical instruments. (Laughter) - Bentzi. Hey, bentzi. - Sand say my feet, of holy wolly woo (laughs). Oowahaha! (Laughs) (Laughs) Look, the weeping monkey. (Sobbing) (Sobbing) (Sobbing turns into laughter) - I'm burning. - [Herman] My old lady, she found your box (laughs). - [Nicole] Aren't you going to open it, shem? [Bum] - This one, he doesn't know how. (Lecherous laughter) - There now, let's not have them talking to you like that. (Bang echoes) -Bum (laughter) (Heavy door creeping open) (Industrial droning and banging) (Film rolling) - I'm burning. (Laughter echoing) - [Doc] If you think of your body as a prison, then that's what it will be, and it will remain your keeper to your grave. (Approaching footsteps) (Distant tolling bell) - [Doc] Stop trying to levitate yourself out of your body. Try instead to elevate your body with your head. - Bum (laughing) (Bell tolling) (Shem creaking) (Cane striking floor) (Shem creaking) (Box creaks open) (Howling wind) (Soft undertone) (Shoveling dirt) (Dog barking in distance) (Dirt landing) - Hey! (Spits out dirt) - Hello? - Who is that? What do you want? - Aver, is that you? - Doc? What are you doing in my room? - Your room? Aver, you're lying in a ditch. - Well what do ya know? I'm... Lying in a ditch. - [Doc] Would you, uh, care to climb out? - Yeah, okay. Sure. - [Doc] Well, thank god you woke up, I might have buried you alive. (Door opens and creaks) - Here, here drink. - Say doc, you got any food lying around? I'm starving. - I must have something. Let me see what I can dig up in the kitchen. (Distant train horn) (Sirens wailing) (Footsteps approaching) We're in luck, my niece prepared a quiche for dinner. I hope that's all right. - I'm sure it's great. Well, I guess I'll turn in then. - [Doc] Yes, of course. You should get some rest, and again I'm sorry about those holes. - [Aver] Yeah, well no biggie. Thanks for the grub, night. - Goodnight aver. Oh uh, do mind your stuff on the stairs. (Footsteps thudding up stairwell) (Keys jingling) (Footseps echoing) (Grunting) (Keys clincking) (Hard thud) (Water dripping) - Hi shem, the doctor should be in any minute. Please try and relax. (Water splashing) (Grunting) (Dog panting) - [Aver] Hey man, you okay? - [Bum] Fetch the keys. (Dog whimpers/growls) (Heavy footsteps approaching) - (Screams) What the hell man? It was an accident. - Shut the fuck up. You little shit. (Dog barking) - I don't have anything. - [Bum] I said shut it, you shit. I don't want your fuckin' money. - What are you... - [Bum] Who the fuck are you? - [Aver] I'm... - You got any food? (Dog barking) Thanks for nothing, you little prick. (Bum laughing) (Door closes) (Seductive music) - [Woman] I thought you'd keep me waiting all night. - Yeah, hi. How's it going? Look, sorry to bother you, I just... - (Laughs) Are you now? - Yeah, look I live down the hall and I just got mugged in the stairwell. I'm okay but... - [Woman] Oh, you're not hurt? - No, I mean nothing serious. I banged my head but... The point is, my keys fell and this guy, the one who hit me, this total maniac or his dog maybe, I don't know. Either way, they took them. My keys. - (Chuckles) Oh my. That's quite a tale. - Yeah, I know. Crazy, right? But I swear it's all true. So now I can't get into my apartment, I'm locked out. I saw your door was open, so I thought you must be awake. Maybe I could use your phone to call the super. - The phone? The super? I see but uh, tell me something. Mr. Neighbor. How do I know you're not just trying to get into a defenseless naked woman's apartment in the dead of night, hmm? Who knows what dreadful things you might try to do to me. - Look, your door was open, I just thought... You know what, forget it, thanks. - Oh stop it. (Chuckles) You're just precious, aren't you? Such a child. Get your silly self in here. - Should I... Do you wanna put something on? - I'm perfectly comfortable. - Right. (Door creaks) - Be a doll and close the door, would you? (Door slams shut) (Music gets louder) - Well sailor, take off your coat, have a seat. Stay a while. (Seductive music) - You mind if I smoke? - Is that how you introduce yourself to a lady? - Sorry. I'm aver, I live down the hall. - [Woman] Aver. Aver (laughs). How do I know that name? - It's biblical. - [Woman] Is it? - That's what they tell me, and you are? - [Woman] Who am I? Who am I, indeed? I am ancient, I am new. I am hidden from plain view. I am darkness before light. I whisper secrets in the night. - So you're a poet. - [Woman] (Laughs) No. But I've known my share. - Any I may have read? - Oh poo, you'll bore me to tears with all that dreadful small talk. - Sorry. - Don't be sorry silly. Weren't you about to smoke? - But I still don't know your name. - Ooohhh. Okay, Mr. Smarty pants. You can call me Lila. Now please, do enjoy that cigarette. (Matchsticks rattle) (Hookah bubbling) (Match striking) - Would you like a hit? - No thanks. - Suit yourself. Tell me, aver. Do you know much about the human brain? - The brain? No, not really. - [Lila] Oh, but it's such a fascinating piece of equipment. - Okay. - [Lila] Did you know, for example, that there's a place, a dark place, buried deep inside the limbic system that the doctors deliciously refer to as the pleasure center? The doctors deliciously refer to as the pleasure center? - [Lila] Imagine, Mr. Man. Inside that little head of yours, lies an electrochemical wonderland. Of all worldly delights such as eating and drinking and fucking. (Music stops) - Umm, that's interesting. Maybe, I umm, should... - How's about turning over that record, big boy? (Record needle bumping) - Sure. (Lever cicks) So, I think I've bothered you enough. I really should be going. If I could just use your phone... - Who's stopping you? (Mystical music) You know, it is rather late. Do you think it's wise to wake the super now? - What time is it? - [Lila] It's late aver, it's very late. If you want, you could spend the night here. With me. - I don't know, I wouldn't want to impose. - Oh, it's no imposition. On the contrary, you'll be giving me a chance to do my good deed for the day. - [Aver] Are you sure? It's an awful lot to ask. - Oh, I'm quite certain cutie. We should let that poor old man sleep. He must be tired after his long days work. After all aver, what are neighbors for? (Mystical music) - [Lila] (Heavy breathing) (Moaning) (Wheels squeaking) (Moaning) (Moaning echoing) Shem. Shem. Sweet shem. (Moaning in distance) (Exhaling) - [Detective m] You noga? - [Detective w] We're the detectives. We found something that belongs to you. - [Aver] Hey, that's my wallet, where'd you find that? - [Detective m] We'll get to that in just a minute. - [Detective w] So Mr. Noga, we hear you like the country. - [Aver] The country? - Yeah the country, you know trees, birds, bees, cows. All that shit. - Not really. - [Detective w] But you were just there, weren't you? About say, two nights ago. (Coffin lid creaking) Name's Herman Walker. But then you're old buddies, aren't ya? He told US you guys go way back. - [Detective m] Games up, noga. He told US all about it. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Did you know your chauffeur is a grave robber? - [Detective m] You sure know how to pick 'em noga. - I didn't pick him, okay? I was lost in the woods and this guy shows up offering me a ride. It's not like I could just jump on the next bus into town, now could I? - Why don't you tell US about your roommate? - Cause I don't have one. - [Detective m] No? Explain this then. - [Detective w] Pay close attention to the address. - [Aver] (Thinking) Same as mine. That's weird. Must be a clerical error or something. - [Detective w] Could be, but then we can't explain the fact that Mr. mochin's wallet was found in the same place as we found yours. - Yeah, where's that? - In this poor bastards coat pocket. - [Aver] Where's... He's got no... - [Detective m] Head. Yeah we noticed that too. Maybe you can tell US where to find it. - What? You think I did this? - Tell me something, noga. Why aren't you wearing your yamaka? - What? - Bet he's not wearing his tzitzit either. - No tefillin this morning neither. You spill your seed last night, noga? - My seed? - She really got to you, didn't she? Got inside you, it's just a matter of time now. You fucked her, am I right? You did, didn't you? Goddamn, grave digger. She's got you good now, just tickling those nodes all over that little head of yours. Kids a goner, lost in the woods. Let's blow. - What about the girl? - [Detective m] Out of our jurisdiction, nothing we can do. Your day of reckoning is gonna come, noga. We're gonna find that head. And when we do, I know the whole thing is gonna be tied to you. Why don't you hold onto that picture for awhile. May get ya thinkin' for once. (Train breaks whining) (Birds chattering) (Low hum) (Pipes groaning) (Eerie rattling) (Telephone rings) (Telephone rings) (Telephone rings) (Answering machine picks up) - [Doc] Hello, aver. Doc here. Just want to make sure everything is still on for tonight. My niece is... You didn't here this from me. But she is simply bubbling over with excitement. You'll take her somewhere nice, of course. And, it goes without saying, be on your best behavior. Well, that's all, just making sure. Oh, I nearly forgot. There is one thing. A pair of detectives dropped by earlier.
