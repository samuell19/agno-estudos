Are they the nuns? - I'm here for that account. - Yes, I know. {SPEAKER ON THE RADIO TALKS ABOUT A FOOTBALL GAME) {FABIO TURNS UP THE VOLUME OF THE RADIO) - Are there warrants to sign? - Yes, there they are.

What's wrong with you? What are these sudden frenzies? &lt;Take 3 days and join me in the country house. What do you say? We haven't been to sleep in a long time! Need heating, rooms are cold. &lt;Don't worry, I'll warm you up in bed! I'm not alone, don't talk like that! There are people! &lt;What do you care? You are a living man, full of health! Do you want to understand it? &lt;Please tell me you want to make love to me! Are you calling me here for these proposals? We have a lot of time ahead of us! &lt;Today I understood many things: life is short, you have to enjoy every moment! &lt;Why postpone? - Because I have the game today! &lt;What? - Rome - Catanzaro: I want to see it, but you never want to understand it! If there is a match, you invent one so I don't see it! &lt;I invent? We haven't made love in 2,000 years! I hardly remember how to do it anymore! &lt;I can't waste time with you, I have to escape home. I see the game, you do what you want. All right? Hello, love, be good. {sighing) But you tell me! - Here you are. Is there anything else to sign? - Not for today. Good. The revolver, the cigarettes... So I can go, huh? - Listen, Fabio... - Tell me, Valeria. If you don't feel like making love to your wife anymore, why don't you start with me again? That? {SPEAKER ON THE RADIO TALKS ABOUT THE GAME) But do you always invent one 5 minutes before the game? &lt;Then you do it on purpose! {(CHRONIST COMMENTS THE GAME) That's it, this is one. Where is the other speaker? Why did you take it off? Where did you put it? Look where they put it! But who moved it? Veronica, why are you moving this to me? - Mom knows. - Eh, Mom knows! I tell you not to touch them, they are delicate, but you move them on purpose. If I then ask you why you moved it, you say: "Mom knows" ”. But do I have to know? Wait up! Did you wear my home sweater? Take it off! I did it on purpose because it keeps me warm! Here we go! Do you wear it? Do you see how you are? Not answer! If I ask Mom why you don't answer me, do you know what she is telling me? &lt;Guess. "Because you speak two different languages". True, Veronica? (Laughs) It's not like we speak two different languages, is that for two and a half years you have decided not to answer me. &lt;Whenever I talk to you I talk only, I look crazy. Have you put your jacket on now? I took it off now, so do it on purpose! It's new, made to measure, I work in the bank! Take it off! Do you realize what you are doing? When there is an important match you and mom conspired not to let me see it! You made me miss the start! Do you know what I do? I push this button, I register it, and tonight, while you sleep, out of spite I see her again! Did you wear a man's hat? How beautiful you are in my hat! Where are you going? May I know where you are going, Veronica? - Mom knows. - Here, Mom knows. {RELIEF SUSPIRE) Nice conversation between father and daughter! What a satisfaction to bring them into the world! Do you want to pass this ball? Don't keep it on your foot! &lt;Maid: Doctor, I iron the linen tomorrow. - Yup. - I couldn't make the shirt... - My daughter wore it, I know. - I have a small account... - You set it up with the lady. - If nothing else is needed, I would leave. - You have to go, you don't need to. I don't need anything, I want to be alone, to watch the game! Pass this ball! The cunning he has! He wanted to take me to the countryside! "Tell me you want to make love to me! Tell me out loud!" I'll fall for it tomorrow! {(CHRONIST COMMENTS THE GAME) And it passes, by God! {(CHRONIST COMMENTS THE GAME) &lt;Chronicler: Network! &lt;Fabio: Oh my God! (NOISE OF THE FANS ON TV} Holy shit!

Do you feel like fighting? - I don't even think about it. - What is this sewing machine? - I found it in the country house. - Did you go there? - Yes, I told you if you wanted to come. My great-grandmother, my grandmother and my mother sewed us with this machine. - (shouting) I want to sew it too! - Why are you raising your voice? If your grandmother sewed us, is it my fault? Do you want to fight? - Where's Veronica? - Are you asking me? She dressed in my clothes and said: "Mom knows where I'm going". -Yes, she went to Marco. - Marco? - Because? -I don't know who she is. Who is she? - Don't worry, I know. - Enough, if you know... - Do you want two spaghetti? The water is boiling. - No, I've already eaten in the country. Yup? I was saying it for you. "I've already eaten!" Imagine, I didn't accompany her to the country house! I knew you were coming home with the desire to fight. Since I cannot escape this fate... Do you see grandma's car? If we want to fight, let's get started right away. We finish first and we don't talk about it anymore! Livia... Livia! &lt;Look at this! What are you doing? - Livia! - Ah! Why are you coming behind me? You scared me! Fear? With 'I'm cold, on the terrace, you get hurt! - What are you looking at? - Nothing, go to sleep. - Anything. - "Go to sleep"? Why do you say "nothing"? What are you looking at? &lt;(laughing) Nothing, huh? Who is that? &lt;Who are you talking about? &lt;Of what he looks up. Who is it? - I do not know. How do I know? Do you really ask me? {sighing) Got it, go! Livia... You had to come up with something to punish me, right? - Then you want to provoke me! -10? - Yup. - You know I'm not jealous, right? - Yes, I know. One winter evening I see you looking out on the terrace, with the cold. Down there is a guy looking at our windows. -Do I have the right to know who he is? - One of the usual ones that runs around me! - What does it mean? - "What does it mean"? - Yup! - That every evening, returning home, I find him there and he stays up late! It's raining, it's cold, and he's always there. And in the morning, going out, I find him there! -Do you mean that he stays there all night waiting for you? - Would that be weird? -He ever talked to you? Did he make approaches, advances? - No, so what? There are so many people on this street! Young, attractive women! Why do you think he's there for you? It's impossible! I, for you, are a rag to throw away! Certain! You never miss an opportunity to despise me! Has the quarrel started? Come on, let it out! Yes, I have to let off steam! I have to let off steam tonight, understand? Because it is impossible for you that a man can be attracted to me! May he like me, my legs, my hips, my things, here! - But who has ever denied you this? - You denied me! Today I wanted to make love with you and you said no, as always! For the match! - And then you said to me on the phone: "Sorry, there are people." - Not at all, Livia! You don't want me anymore! But there are men who look at me, look for me, they would be ready to go crazy to come to bed with me! What are you saying? At your age! You have a 16 year old daughter! Tearing them up, you invent a young man who spends the night down at the door... - Let's not talk about him, I don't care! Let's talk about us! - Good night! {MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) {FABIO SUSSULTA) But that's it... Say, you... - What are you doing here? - Because? Why did he come in here? What are you doing around this car? - Nothing, I was looking. - I want to know what you have to watch. I know you: yesterday I saw you, impaled in front of the door! - You've been mailing a lady for days! What do you want? - That's my business! Your business? It's my business, not yours! - But who are you? - it? But who are you? If you don't mind, I'm the lady's husband! Then you should know who I am and what I do. Do I have to guess? Tell me! - I work it for Mr. Cavalli. - What do I care! Who is Cavalli? - The owner of the detective agency "The discreet eye." - Discreet eye? - The one who takes care of his wife. - What are you saying? - You investigate my wife and I don't know anything? Come with me! - Where is it? At the police station! You tell the inspector what you are telling me! But what do I tell him? I do my job. - Let's go to Signor Cavalli, head of the agency. - Wait up! - He explains everything to her. -What explains him? It may even be that it has nothing to do with it. Let's go to him, but if he doesn't clarify this situation, I'll give you the discreet eye! I blow it up to both of you! Here we go! - I lead the way in my car, follow me. - No, where are you going? I follow you, but come with me, in my car! You waste my time! Where is this agency? It is there, doctor, on the first floor. Look, man, when someone investigates they do it for a reason. - Do not investigate like that, fucking dog! - The reasons are there, but I don't know. - I receive orders from Cavalli, the head of "The discrete eye" ”. - Mh... Discreet eye... - Please, take a seat. &lt;Horses: Ah, you're back! Who is this gentleman? The husband of the lady we are following. Oh God! Gee, what a surprise! I did not expect this meeting. She had asked to remain anonymous, I didn't expect to see her here. - Please, take a seat. - $ i. - What should I call you: Doctor, Excellency? - You mustn't call me, you just have to tell me why this young man is stalking my wife! Excellency, he is a hound: he is my nephew and he follows his wife night and day! Without respite, as per the order given. How per order given? And who gave it to him? - Who gave it to me? - Yes, who gave it to him? Excellence, let's not joke. When she went to London her press officer came to my office, he ordered me to follow his wife and gave me 2.5 million in cash to prevent checks with her signature from circulating. What do you check? Which press officer? I have never been to London nor have I ordered to shadow my wife! Excellency, it is not that you have come to know of certain political intrigues and to cover up this international conspiracy she now she pretends nothing has happened and she refuses even to pay the last installment, esteemed Dr. Vitali? - Doctor Vitali? My name is Fabio Bonetti. I work in a bank, my wife does translations to supplement. Who do you think you are talking to? You have the wrong person! - Who the fuck are you following? - Mrs Elena Vitali, living in piazza dell'Oro, n ° 6. Then it is clear: Mrs. Vitali! My wife has nothing to do with it! You are following an important lady, the wife of Dr. Vitali, a famous economist who is now in London. - Do you know her? She-she She is my hostess! You live on the top floor of my building. - I don't understand anything anymore, but you can help me clear up the misunderstanding. &lt;10? Just a minute, please. Please, take a seat. &lt;Look at that apparatus: all modern! Russian and American appliances! &lt;This is the latest discovery: an electronic microphone. Record a long-distance sigh. Very interesting, but what do I have to do with it? - Wait. Please have a seat. - Yup. Go! Okay. Permit... - Doctor, do you recognize this woman? - Who? - Is it Mrs. Vitali? - I don't know, I see her from behind. &lt;She's as blonde as she is, but I can't swear it's her. Now he will see some details, watch out. This is me, driving my car. &lt;I chase and follow Vitali's car night and day with my nephew. &lt;Dear Doctor, it is a delicate and very stressful job. &lt;We must stick to the prey like mastiffs. - Now pay attention to detail. &lt;YES. &lt;Do you see it? &lt;I see it, yes. - Do you recognize her? Is it Mrs. Vitali? - I do not know. I don't think it's her, this leg is too curvy. I've known her for years, but I didn't know she had this pair of thighs! &lt;Understood, Mrs. Vitali? Do you know what I'm saying, Cavalli? I'm getting excited! And not me? This is the fifth time I've seen the video! &lt;Who knows what buttocks she has! &lt;Butt bitches, you say? - God, this is my wife! &lt;What? -Her wife? - It is not possible! She is my wife! And she took the liberty of making compliments! - I'll slap her! - I said it without knowing it! - Thank God you didn't know! - Asshole! Will you explain to me what happened? - Didn't you understand? - No! This asshole, instead of Vitali, has been stalking his wife for 5 weeks! I followed the orders: to follow Vitali night and day in front of the house and follow a Panda... - A Panda? - Eh! Then the misunderstanding was born on the plate! - The license plate? - Of the car! Vitali lent it to my wife when she smashed her Cinquecento. - And now? - Your cabbages, I'm going to the bank! You went to university too! Doctor, wait! Errare humanum est! Doctor, come here! Doctor Bonetti! &lt;Listen to me! Doctor, come back, we'll agree! {MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) Goodmorning doctor. Look how we put it back in place: it looks like new! You will understand, it took you 4 weeks! If you only knew the troubles for this car! They are 530,000 lire. - 530,000? Jokes? - Do you argue about the price? His wife is miraculously alive. They pulled it out with the blowtorch! -So she pays, so she learns! -Okay, as you want her. (MOTOR NOISE) What is it? Ah. Veronica, where are you going? - Veronica, where are you going? - Mom knows! Here, I insist. What am I asking him to do? (TYPE MACHINE NOISE) - Livia, it's me! - Hello. - Hello sweetheart. - Hello Beautiful. The mechanic brought back your Cinquecento. Oh yes? Finally, thank goodness! It's 500,000 lire, you have to pay them! - You want to laugh? &lt;Eh... - Want to know a good one? - Which? {laughing) Listen... - Do you know what happened to me this morning? - What? {laughing) That young man who stood at the front door last night and he looked on our terrace...- Eh... - You said he was there for you. - What are you doing, start over? Do you know what I found out? Don't be mad, Livia, but she was there for another woman! For another woman? And who is this woman? Attic, top floor. - Mrs Vitali? - And no? Dr. Vitali, when he left for London, hired an agency to follow his wife. - So that was a cop! - No, a private detective. -But he goes "! - {(Laughing) Yes. Incredible! Who would have imagined that a cultured and important person as his excellence could get so low? Look at that... - This is nothing! - Mah! The funny thing is that jerk detective got it all wrong. (LAUGH) Well? For 5 weeks, instead of stalking Mrs. Vitali... -What did he do? &lt;He has stalked you! - Myself? &lt;YES. Have you been following me for 5 weeks? - Are you laughing? - Why, aren't you laughing? &lt;Not only did they follow you... they filmed you. They put microphones everywhere, even in the car, to hear what you were saying. Oh mama! Fabio, I feel bad! - What is wrong with you, Livia? - My head is spinning, I feel bad. You are all white! What did you do, what happened to you? Did they follow me for 5 weeks? &lt;YES. - Day and night... They put microphones everywhere! - But what do you care? - What do I care? Yes, what do you care? Do you think it right for a stranger to enter my private life, that you spy on me without me knowing anything? - Ah! - Livia... - Huh? Look into my eyes. Have you done anything in the past few weeks that you need to be ashamed of? - Huh? - Do you have to be ashamed? - No. - So what are you worried about? You have nothing to hide and neither do I! If anything, Vitali must be ashamed! But she hasn't been stalked! She is calm! But tell me if two women can get confused, two so different people! - How can you make such a big, big mistake? - You can. It's not the agency's fault. If you saw what a poor fellow, Signor Cavalli! The fault lies with the car that Vitali lent you, they followed the license plate. - That's how! - Already! So, first of all, let's give the car keys back to Vitali. So she doesn't talk about it anymore and that's the end of it. - Better call her first. Call her, I'm going to change. - Yup. - What are you doing? - Let's take the elevator. - Let's go on foot, let's do it first. - Yup. On the phone he said he needs to talk to us about something important. What do you want? - We know what it is. - Things? - The usual story: the apartment. - Oh yes. - Shall we tell you that her husband was following her? - You're crazy? - Don't talk, let me talk. - Yay. Mrs. Vitali... - Dear Livia... - Good morning. - Treats. - Good morning, Doctor Bonetti. - Please make yourselves comfortable. - Thank you. - Thank you. Please. We are very honored by the friendship he grants us. We thank you very much for the favors you have done us, especially for lending the car to my lady. - For heaven's sake, it was a pleasure! - Thank you so much. Give her the keys. - Here are the keys, ma'am. - Have a drink? - No, I don't drink. - You really don't want anything? - Really, I never drink. - Get me a whiskey. &lt;She is a teetotaler. Sometimes I also tell her: "Have a drink, it picks you up!", But she doesn't drink. This does not interest the lady, who perhaps she must talk to us about serious matters. &lt;True, ma'am? - These are things you already know. This is about your apartment. As the owner of the building, I have an interest in you letting it go. You pay a ridiculous amount for it. I believe it: 180,000 lire in a building like this! It is little, right? It is not cheap, it is the right amount that we pay based on the fair rent. I offered you 40 million to leave him, now I offer you 50. No. - 50 million, you say? - $ i. - A nice sum! - Not a good amount! Because we, with 50 million, don't buy an apartment like this. Think about it, you may not be entitled to anything anymore. My lawyer inquired about you, he found out you have a second home. - Exactly. - By law it might... No, it couldn't do anything, it's a farmhouse, I was born there. | mine were farmers, they inherited it from their grandfather. - He was a yob, the farmer father. - Now I need the apartment. If he was a yob, why don't you go and live in the country house? - I do not know. - You know very well! Excuse me, but it is not a house we can live in. At most you can spend a weekend there. Besides, it is out of the ordinary of Rome. - Yes, this is out. - I thought you would be more understanding. After all the favors done, a little gratitude... - Believe me, it's not up to me. - No, always from me! - Madam, your husband is on the phone from London. - Thank you. Hello, Osvaldo? Darling, how are you? Yes, but I called you too tonight, love. Why don't you take a few days off? No, I'm not going out tonight. I have a little migraine. I was talking to the Bonettis. - Yes, I'm here with me. - Greetings to your Excellency. - Sst! You didn't find me yesterday because I played poker all night. - Did I hurt? - Don't bother. - Do not drink. &lt;Your daughter is with me, where do you want her to be? &lt;You accuse me unfairly. No! She tries to calm you down, don't yell like that. (FABIO AND LIVIA BISBIGLIANO) &lt;Don't make me jealous scenes! Who told you these things? You are not only jealous, you are sick with nerves! - {softly) Let's go. - Don't scream, let me explain. - No! - Come on... - I tell you no! - Madam... - We're leaving. - Yes, go. - Here we go. Let me talk, let me explain! I took a walk because all my friends were watching the game on TV and I'm bored! It's not true! How do you know it? You have someone to inform you! - Fabio... - Yes? - Doctor Cavalli, "The discreet eye". - Who? - Doctor Cavalli. - My Madonna! What do you want? Go to the cashier, you can collect. Ready? It's me. Tell me, what's still there? &lt;Aren't you curious about your wife's private life? My wife has no private life. The misunderstanding is cleared up. Don't call me at the bank anymore and leave me alone! &lt;I have a suitcase with miles of film shot in secret. &lt;Every woman, even the most honest, has something to hide. Cavalli was a sports reporter, disbarred for rigging a dog race. A rascal, a blackmailer. Stay away! Oh well, but he has some documents, some videos. And he makes insinuations about my wife. That rogue does it to inject you with the germ of jealousy, knowing full well that a closed suitcase always arouses morbid curiosity. Like the Easter egg! But when one says: "Even the most honest woman has her secrets"... Old clichés! I might be suspicious of all women in the world, but not of Livia! I'm sure. I was just saying... - Do you mind scratching my nose? - Huh? I would like you to scratch my nose. Yes, but what do we do with the suitcase? Shall we report Cavalli? Good boy! Thus the suitcase ends up in court and becomes a body of crime. The judge opens it and the films are used as evidence against Vitali, in the trial of politicians and bankruptcies. So what do I do, do I have to suffer? Can't I report it? Look what I suffered, how they reduced me! Multiple fractures, cracked spine, then shoulder, arm, ulna, knee, femur, shin, heel... - Even the toes! - Madonna! What is it? Months and months of bed in the orthopedic clinic! I recognized the person who hit me, but I don't want to report. Yup? Did you recognize the hijacker and don't report him? - No, because I'm afraid of the law myself. - You, a lawyer? I am sure that, in front of the judge, you never know how it will end! At what time was it invested? Didn't he recognize the hit-and-run? If he did, why didn't he report it right away? - Yeah, why? &lt;Let me finish! You may be right, but the process can backfire on you. Unfortunately you know: none of us have clean hands. - For you, do I have to ignore that suitcase? - Yes, as if you didn't know it exists. Always denying having seen it, in every place and circumstance. &lt;Deny everything and don't tell anyone, not even your wife! (SIRENS) (JOURNALISTS VOICE) - Is the minister coming? -Yes. -He Go inside. &lt;Man: Give me the go-ahead for the recording. &lt;Go! Here London, Sandro Paternostro speaks to you. The well-known Italian finance magnate Lorenzo Vitali was found murdered in his apartment, in a large London hotel. &lt;Journalist: We are in Dr. Vitali's apartment, in an eighteenth-century building, in the heart of old Rome, on the banks of the Tiber. - Halt! Where you go? - As? -He is a tenant, let him pass. - Please, take a seat. - What happened? - What happened? - A slaughterhouse. - Go. &lt;Fabio: Television? There must be a misunderstanding! &lt;I am Dr. Bonetti, a bank employee, this is the first time I have been filmed on TV. (SIRENS) I realize the gravity of it, but I was unaware of everything. I arrived and a carabiniere stopped me. Here they are! Alt! Reporter: Here it is, quick! - Excuse me, who's coming? - Senator Farisù. -And who is he? - The minister. - Journalists: Minister... - Your Excellency... - Reporters: Do you allow a question? This way... - Permission... Permit? I am a tenant. Permit. - Top floor. - Yes I know. - Allows? She goes to Mrs Vitali, on the top floor. &lt;Yes. &lt;I recognized you immediately, Minister. I saw it on TV. &lt;Heard what a tragedy? (BUZZ) A photo that costs you? - Fabio... - Arrive, minister. - Fabio! - Huh? - What a mess! Have you heard? - There's even TV! Do you see what personality? - Your lawyer friend is on the phone. - Ronconi? -Who was he? - The Minister of Foreign Trade. You do not know him? not me. &lt;Quaestor: The wife reacted well. - Will you go to London now, Commissioner? - No I do not think so. There are investigations to be explored here. &lt;Fabio: How do I not know? I arrived home and it is full of people! &lt;Ronconi, you were right, Vitali is a more important personality than we thought. There is a hustle and bustle here! Coming and going of ministers, journalists, photographers... What do we do with the suitcase, will I report it to the police? No? I understand. It is as if it does not exist. Okay, I do as you say. Thanks, lawyer. Best wishes for fractures! What is this suitcase? At the agency there is a suitcase with miles of films shot about you. - On d | myself? Then you have to make it disappear, destroy it immediately! On the contrary: we must be ignorant, as if it did not exist. The lawyer says it's the only way not to get involved. - Maybe, but I don't feel safe. - Livia... Love, I repeat the question: Have you done things in the last few weeks that you need to regret? - You already asked. - Huh? - No. - So, take it easy. Let's see TV, rather. Do not panic. - Here you are. &lt;Here London, Sandro Paternostro speaks to you. &lt;Here is the latest news on the Vitali case. Interesting testimony, according to Scotland Yard, that of a telephone operator at the hotel, that you stated that last night, at 9.00 pm, Vitali had a telephone conversation with Rome and spoke to a certain Cavalier Cavalli. He is the owner of a private investigation agency, called "Discreet Eye". &lt;A detail of extreme interest that emerged in the last few hours is that the body had the marks of a gunshot to the temple and some drops of blood were found on the mirror. - Heard? - Did they kill him in the mirror? Because? Following the conspiracy trail, Scotland Yard, in collaboration with the Italian authorities, through Interpol, stopped several people. &lt;It is not known whether these arrests will be transformed into arrest. (SIRENS} Daje! What is this siren? - Look'. - What's going on out there? (JOURNALISTS VOICE) Carabiniere: You can't pass! My Madonna! Livia, down there is the end of the world! A general has arrived, two police cars... But what's going on? - I have a lot of confusion in my head! Livia, I have a presentiment... - About what? What about? (DOORBELL}) No, I'm going! - Please: we are ignorant of everything! - Yup. - Oh! - Huh? - If it's the police, don't resist. Go and open! - Good evening, Inspector. - No, ma'am, I'm a reporter. - Doctor Letta! - I should call the paper. I can? - Are you the director of "Il Tempo"? - Yup. &lt;Will you allow me to introduce myself? Doctor Bonetti. &lt;Very pleased. - I saw her on TV. She is always the sharpest. - Very nice. -Do you give me the overcoat? - Just make a phone call and leave right away. - Make him a coffee. - Would you like some coffee? - A reporter never turns it down. You're welcome, Dr. Letta. - Many thanks. - You are welcome. - A cigarette? - Thank you. I'm the editor, can you give me the editor-in-chief? Thank you. My God, make him shut up! Marcello? Good evening. I just talked to the widow. She says she got her husband's last call yesterday afternoon from London. Yes, yes. She-she Says it was a normal, quiet phone call. - Mh... No. Wait, there's a witness to that phone call, the downstairs tenant, who denies she was quiet and normal. - {softly) Holy shit! - They may have killed him to shut his mouth, but I would not rule out other reasons. For example, he may have committed suicide for private reasons. - Livia... - Huh? - Talk about yesterday's phone call! - I know, I saw you! - See what? - Shut up, let's hear him say. &lt;The reason for the suspicions is that, when they lived in Milan, she had her followed by a private agent and I have the feeling, even if the widow denies, she that she made her follow her to Rome too. She says he got threatening phone calls, because she has an interest in crediting the conspiracy thesis, she puts politics in the way, but I would not rule out that it is a private reason, a familiar thing, between husband and wife. An intrigue with a passionate background. - A passionate intrigue? - Eh! - What does it mean? - With a passionate background... It does not mean anything! You don't know anything! - And you tell me? - And to whom? Let's get him the coffee. &lt;The widow has every interest in accrediting the thesis of the conspiracy, but she doesn't convince me at all. See you in the editorial office. Hello. - Here's the caffettino. - How much sugar? - Nothing, ma'am. - Ah... - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Are you very close to Vitali's? - Yes No. Why do you say no? We are good acquaintances. I typed thousands of pages for poor Vitali. &lt;I translated conferences, economic reports... My wife does translations to supplement her salary. - Excuse me, what are you writing? - Nothing, don't worry. Did you ever suspect that Mrs. Vitali's life was being controlled? If we talk about suspicions, that's it! - No suspicions! - Nobody. - Never! It seemed to me that you first supported this thesis. She also nodded her head in the affirmative. -10? - No, no mention of the affirmative. If she thinks about the movement she makes with her head, it's just a tic, she doesn't mean anything. It is now late. If she... Can I ask a few questions, ma'am? - Go ahead, doctor. - No, doctor. We don't say anything anymore, we have said too much. - Please take a seat. - Just a question. - No, doctor. She made the call, we offered her a coffee, don't take advantage of our kindness. - I get it, okay. - As you wish. - Please, take a seat. - Arrive, ma'am. &lt;Good evening. - Don't put our names in the paper. &lt;You do not worry. - Arrive, ma'am. - Goodbye. - Very honored to have met you. - Get to her, thank you. - What do you say, did I do something wrong? - Don't ask me! You got it all wrong! Why, what did I say? You have to explain to me why when I say yes you always say no! The lawyer told me: "Always deny, even the evidence." Oh yes? Leave the coffee alone! So why when she said: "I suppose Vitali was also followed in Rome" did you say yes when i said no? - I was wrong! Why when she said "I think this is a conspiracy" did you say no? - I tell you. - Because? You do not know? I'll tell you, listen. Now I'll explain: Dr. Vitali has been in London for a month, but Mrs. Elena remains alone in Rome. - What is a pretty young lady doing who is alone in Rome? -What is she doing? She goes out every night, she frequents certain circles, financiers, politicians, nobles, intellectuals, artists, socialites. She knows many men and may prefer one in particular. He does things with great discretion, but there are those who see, hear and report. Dr. Vitali, in London, is shaving. A call from Rome tells him: "His wife slept with a man". He calls his wife, she confesses, he goes back to the mirror, and instead of finishing his beard, he fires a revolver. - My God! Fabio, what did you say? - What I've said? - Do you realize? - $ i. - Who was calling Vitali in London? - The private detective. But the detective was following me, not Mrs. Vitali! - Livia! - Ah! -But then he killed himself for you, not for his wife! - Ninth! - Murderer! What did you do to lead him to suicide? - Anything! - Anything? - I didn't do anything wrong! - Do you swear to me? - I swear! He is a political intrigue! -It is true, love, he is a political intrigue. He even said it on TV! - Yup. - We have nothing to do with it! - Anything! No love! {MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) &lt;Horses: Mrs. Bonetti! &lt;She You can't take my suitcase away without giving me anything. - At least give me... - Not even a lira, not even if you kill yourself! - Thank God I don't report you! - We don't play jokes, eh!

Thanks, Valeria. &lt;Fabio .. - Yes? Where are you calling from? Where do you spend these 4 days? In the country house. Look, nobody knows, huh! &lt;I only told you. Thank you.

But where does it go? &lt;Boy: This year just... It is a bad year. It had been a little better last year. Shut up, shut up! Remo, what about this? She's a fake skinny: she has a nice mandolin ass. I would catch it! Livia: Hi, King! Among the rascals! A token and a glass of wine! What are you doing, are you drinking? Aren't you a teetotaler? Do you drink in the morning? - Give it to me white and dry. - Nice ice cream, here. - Get this quartino. - Thank you. - Cheers! Look at the glass of wine you drink! - Brrr! Bono! - I told you! - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Boy: The referees have always been angry with Rome. - Yup. A mandolin! - Who are you hooking up with? - Are you mad at me? - With you and your asshole friend! - Livia! 'I'm complimenting your sister! Go to pija 'nder culo! You never talk like that at home! Ready? I'm Livia, Fabio's wife. Don't you recognize me? You have called my house many times! No, I don't feel like fighting. I just wanted to tell her... In short, I would like to talk to you. Yes. I'm under his house, at the bar. We could meet here at Pallotta's. Huh? Thank you. See you later. To Remo, if we see! - Hi, Livia. - Hello. Who will you have made an appointment with? Mah! Good morning, take a seat. (FABIO SUSSULTA) - A little olive, some cheese? - No thank you. - Some wine? - Thanks, I don't drink. - Valeria! - Look, can I give you some tu? - If you want, it's the same for me. Here, I know that you have been my husband's lover for a long time. &lt;That's not true. &lt;That's true. Last summer my daughter caught you in bed together in our country house. - I did not realized. - Well, you were asleep! Since you were naked and my daughter is polite, she let you sleep. If she says so, her daughter, I don't think I can deny it. Yes you have to deny! But I had noticed long before that Fabio had a mistress! - Oh yes? How did you understand this? - {(sighing) From what? Know that sexual relations between my husband and I have always been a little... "lukewarm". - Warm, huh? &lt;At first with me too: monotonous. - Mashed potato! Then, one evening 3 years ago, all of a sudden, he comes home, and his relationships in bed have changed in a revolutionary way! - Really! And what was he doing? - Eh, what was he doing? You have no idea! I don't want to go into details, but her erotic fantasy she was unleashed, she had no limits! How can I explain to you? &lt;He made you do things I can't repeat! - What do you say? -His erotic fantasy was limitless! &lt;Really? -He must have read some pornographic magazines-No, no. He just met you. I too was tired of making love in the position of the friar. Huh? - The position of the friar? - Yes, woman below and man above. What are you going to tell her, Valeria ?! Ah, that one? Is that the position of the friar? Here it is, imagine! She now she discovers that it is the position of the friar... Would it be the worst? - Not the worst, but the most banal. - Ah! So one evening I said to him: "Do we want to change?". - You had the courage to tell him, I never! - Sure that... Put two women together, wife and friend, talking about the man, hear what they say! - I taught him to make love in various positions. - Ah! As a Yugoslav boy had taught me. You didn't tell me! Ah, from the Yugoslav boy! You learned it from him! &lt;Then you taught my husband. That's why, back home, he abandoned the position of the friar and gave him down: he threw me in the air, lay me on my side, standing, in the kitchen, on the bench... Oh well, but Livia... - Boss? &lt;Yes? - Another half liter! &lt;Now! - Daje! Anyway I knew that he was married, that you were there, that there was no future, so I left him three months ago. - But for God's sake, why are you leaving him? &lt;You ruined me! - Because? &lt;From that day on the game is over, as if by magic. - Here's the half liter. - Certain! He has almost died out. &lt;He's got fat, he didn't speak anymore. &lt;We weren't making love anymore. He spent his evenings in front of the TV. That damn thing that keeps us from having any relationship! &lt;Sorry, but why did you want to meet me? Is that in two months, exactly on January 2nd, I'm going to Milan. I got a job and I'm leaving my husband forever. I still don't understand what you want from me. What do I have to do with all this? When I am gone... Fabio is like a creature, he will be alone. &lt;He's like an ostrich, he doesn't want to know the truth. &lt;I'm sorry! - What are you saying? If you left it for me, I was wondering if... you could get back together. No! No, Livia, never! Fabio... - Fabio, it's me. -Who is he? - Valeria! - Hello. - What are you doing here, what happened? There were two warrants to sign, I thought I'd bring them to you. But I already agreed with the director, he signed them. Why did you come? What have you come to do? Today you called me and said you would stay in the countryside for 3 days, without your wife... - What about this? - I thought you didn't have the courage to tell me openly. - Tell you what? You wanted to resume our relationship. You were wrong, you thought wrong! Your wife has already decided to leave you. -Soon she will go away, you will be alone. - I know it. I know you've seen each other! A month ago you spoke, confabulated, decided about my life! "I leave it, you take it back..." What are they, a parcel? Without Livia I cannot live! If she leaves me, I'll kill myself! You are young, find another one! Damn me and the day I opened that suitcase! At least I didn't know anything before! I was happy! &lt;Look what a state you have reduced me to! (BELL SOUNDS REPEATEDLY) Veronica, where is mom? Livia! Livia! Livia, it's me, I'm back! Well, where is my golf? Where are the slippers?

There is no need to justify yourself if you were late to take stock... with muddy shoes. I didn't ask you. Livia... Livia... - Have you been to the cellar? - Of course! - I was looking for something that no longer exists. - Ah! They took her away. - Something always disappears from there. - Can't you get the lock changed? What is the use of closing the barn when the oxen have already run away? (TG) Veronica, can you close the TV? &lt;That damn TV! Do not overdo it! At least we watch the news, right? Since I feel a strange atmosphere, I go to eat in my room.

Who's giving it to him? Where do they find it? - Who are these drug dealers? - I had to learn it at my own expense. Because Veronica got her first heroin injection when she was 13. - At 13? - Of course! At 13! I told you: "Don't send her around with those dirty, long-haired guys"! It was not the boys his age, but an elder. That sure was he was dirty! - What are you saying? - What am I saying? You sent your daughter, at 13, to her villa by the sea, because you didn't trust boys her age. -But who are you, a friend of mine? - Your best friend. The wife was not there, there was no one... She started giving her a joint. When Veronica returned from the sea she was already addicted to drugs. She is a drug dealer, along with two boys her age. &lt;i&gt;And all the earnings went to your dirty friend.&lt;/i&gt; - Is it the lawyer Ronconi? - Of course! No, the gun no!

I broke everything for him. So are you the hijacker? Yes my love. That's where I smashed the Cinquecento. &lt;Ronconi: Multiple fractures, cracked spine, then shoulder, arm, ulna, knee, femur, shin, heel... &lt;Even the toes! - Good morning, Roman. - Good morning, Livia. - Do you have the manuscript? - $ i. - Let me see. - There he is.

No, I think my husband took his own life for private reasons, before his killers put their plans into action. &lt;What would these private reasons be? My husband was a very jealous man. A few weeks ago I noticed that a young man was standing under my house. I realized that I had to be followed. &lt;I tried to move with caution, but evidently couldn't. &lt;My husband was informed daily in London of everything I was doing. He thus learned that in his absence, out of desperation, I drank considerable amounts of spirits and that I was about to leave him for good. &lt;What was, for her, the news that led her husband to suicide, the ultimate element that determined her tragic act? &lt;I had lent my car to an acquaintance who lives in the building, so I took my husband's Jaguar and went to a friend who was in his villa by the sea. Obviously, that young man had followed me. She informed my husband that I had had a secret date with a man. &lt;Back home, there was a phone call from London. &lt;Messrs Livia and Fabio Bonetti were also present, who live in the same building. My husband accused me of cheating on him. I denied it, but when the Bonettis left, I confessed that I had betrayed him. There was a long silence, then suddenly I heard the echo of a shot. Excuse me. (CODE OF THE TG) Poor thing is Mrs. Elena, who carries this remorse for her whole life! - Remorse? - Certain! I think you for some reason you made those statements. Maybe to cover her who knows what hindrances! Because things are never as they are told. Don't you think a man can kill himself because his wife is cheating on him? No, I think a man so cultured, with great responsibilities, with real problems, he can't be killed for such nonsense. - Nonsense, you say? - Eh! Maybe you are right. With everything going on nowadays, inflation, unemployment, world hunger, danger of atomic war... If someone tells you that your wife has slept with someone else, you just have to laugh! But to piss under with laughter! - Do not overdo it! Eat up! - Yay. - Listen... - Mh... We're not staying at home tonight. Let's go out, huh? Of course, you are right. - What do you want to do, beautiful? - Well... We go to the cinema. You haven't taken me there for a long time! Good idea! And then we make a pizza, like the boys. Cincin, love! - We have to go out in the evening. We can't always be in front of the TV. - Certain! - You shredded all the spaghetti. - I got a little nervous. It was just that my stomach had closed up a little. Now it has opened to me. - Are you hungry now? - Now yes. We're taking a cruise this summer. - Do you know Pierdominici? - Eh... - The family goes on a cruise every year. - I'd love to. Where do we go? Where you like. We buy a tent and travel the world. A tent? No, the curtain is not. &lt;Why? - Why not. &lt;Look what is used today! {VOICES OF FABIO AND LIVIA FADE OUT) {MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) Subtitles by your buddy, Paisan Tony!
