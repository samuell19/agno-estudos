Good evening. This is Sander Vanocur, and this is the GNT world news. After seven months of fighting... ...the civil war in Shadaloo may have reached a turning point. The capital has just fallen. This is Chun-Li Zang with GNT News. A.N. forces are consolidating their hold on Shadaloo City today... ...after a night of skirmishing... ...that secured this key Southeast Asian port. But these soldiers aren't celebrating just yet. They know that defeating the rag-tag city militia is one thing. Defeating the heavily armed forces of General M. Bison is quite another. The Allied Nation forces know... ...that they are dealing with a power-mad dictator. A dictator whose drug money has equipped his army... ...with high-tech weaponry which some intelligence experts fear... ...is equal to anything in the industrialized world. It's been only 24 hours... ...since this dangerous and unpredictable warlord... ...seized 63 Allied Nations relief workers from a village north of here. This self-styled general's ransom demand? An astonishing $20 billion. Meanwhile, the location of the 63 hostages remains unknown. Of the 15 Allied Nations troops... ...assigned to guard the missing relief workers... ...12 are confirmed dead and three are missing... ...their whereabouts also unknown. Hostage pit closing. You came from across the world to fight me, soldier. Stand clear. Now is your chance. --Allied Nations relief workers... ...kidnapped 24 hours ago by Shadaloo.... Pathetic. I think I see the A.N. commander arriving now. I'm going to try to talk to him. Yes, your turn now. Colonel Guile? Colonel Guile. Colonel Guile, Chun-Li Zang, GNT news. May we speak to you, sir, please? No. But don't you wanna speak to the world audience? No. But I do want to talk to someone: That bastard, Bison. I know you like to look at yourself on television... ...you sick son of a bitch, so look at this! What are you doing? Dee Jay, break in. Now! You want me on TV, I'm on TV now. Leave it. What the hell? -Balrog. Balrog, do you believe this? -Believe this, Honda? I'm shooting it. -Colonel Guile. Greetings. -He took the bait. Trace that signal. Why do you address a fellow warrior with such disrespect? Warrior? You? How many doctors and nurses have you killed this week? How many children have you orphaned? You will choke on those words, Guile. Any time, dickhead. We'll go worldwide. Just like now. -General. They're tracing this. -You think you're so clever, Guile. Think about this: you have three days. If my $20 billion are not delivered by then... ...the hostages will die, and the world will hold you responsible. -Victory! -Bison! Bison! Bison! You hostages! If you can hear me, we're coming. We're coming. Charlie! Charlie. Hang on, buddy. We're coming. We're coming! Hang on. "Carlos Blanka." Charlie. So you are Guile's friend? Take him to the laboratory. Attention, all personnel. Until zero hour, all off-duty personnel... ...must be in full kit with loaded sidearms until further notice. We couldn't trace it. He broke off too soon. You know what? For a minute, you were almost useful. Attention, motor pool. APCs will be battle-ready by taps. Requisition any supplies-- He doesn't like women, does he? Oh, no. No, he doesn't like journalists. I assure you, it's an equal-opportunity dislike. Vega! Vega! Vega! Okay, we're off the street. You feel safe yet? -Yeah. Real safe. -Hey. This way. In here. -Good evening, gentlemen. -Good evening, Sagat. Quite a party. Didn't anyone tell you there's a curfew? In Shadaloo City, no one tells me anything. There is a 7 p.m. curfew in Shadaloo City. Violators will be shot on sight. May I offer you a drink? Or anything else? Let's skip the Miss Manners and get down to business. Do you have the $100,000? -Do you have the weapons? -They're hidden. When we get outside, with our money... ...we'll call you on this. Tell you where your guns are. Do we have a deal or not? -You need this, Sagat. -Oh, no. I already know that the weapons are on the pier... ...behind the Mount Brazer brewery. In fact, my men have unloaded the truck and brought the weapons here. What's the matter, gentlemen? Surely you're not afraid of your own weapons? Toys. I like my games live. And in living color! Interesting. You weren't all talk after all. Doctor Dhalsim. How is your research today? The same. Warped. Corrupted. My science twisted to serve perversion instead of peace. Tell you what. After I've crushed my enemies, we'll see about getting you published. That should cheer you up. Now, let's have a look at the patient. Excellent. He'll do very nicely. You have a perfect soldier. -You mean a perfect killer. -Let's not quibble over definitions. Is that a reaction to the programming? What's he receiving? See for yourself. Merely educational software. Why does he find it disturbing? Because unlike you, he's not psychotic. You take risks, doctor. Do not presume so much on my good nature. When his brain has become a killing machine... ...my loyal scientists will start on his body. The next fight! The challenger, Ryu! The defender, my champion, Vega! Vega! Vega! Vega! All bets start... ...$100 American. -Sorry I talked you into all this. -I'm sorry I listened. -Popular guy. -Greatest cage fighter since Iron Fist. -Oh, yeah? What happened to him? -He retired and became me. Vega! Vega, I'm over here! Vega! Vega! Oh, yeah! No weapons! No weapons! No weapons! -Why are you making me watch this? -Research. You fight next. You're all under arrest. Good morning, Shadaloo. The staff meeting is now in session. New business? Colonel, my commando team is at full readiness. But we need to know if the assault will be by land, sea or air. I knew that was coming. Cammy? We were able to get Bison to break radio silence. Unfortunately, not long enough to pinpoint the signal. At this point, all we say for certain... ...is his base is hidden somewhere here, the river delta region. Let's go. Move it, move it. Any other new business? Sir! Look. Shadaloo Tong. Attention. There will be a series of... ...mandatory inoculations for all prisoners commencing at 1400 hours. Delousing will follow immediately. That is all. -You'd think they were afraid of us. -Not us. This could be the break we need. If Sagat runs guns to Bison... ...then he's got to know where Bison is hiding. All we have to do is to infiltrate someone into his gang. Excuse me, sir... ...but Sagat didn't get to the top of the Asian underworld by taking risks. He's not the type of guy who makes new friends. T. Hawk, who are those two men? Ken Masters and Ryu Hoshi. Couple of low-rent operators. We took them in last night. Come on. Come on! -Let's go! -Get off me! Get them patched up and bring them to me. Yes, sir. -Get off me! -Get off me! If Sagat won't trust new friends, maybe he'll trust some new enemies. Let's go. Oh, God! Subject's muscle mass increased by 49 percent. Subject's muscle mass increased by 50 percent. Attention, all medical personnel. Refugees incoming on Dock 3. Refugees incoming on Dock 3. Doctor Howard, report to refugee infirmary at once. Here, here. Come on. These people here have a chance. Those hostages Bison is holding have less than that. -What is this, a guilt trip? -Call it a wake-up call, gentlemen. Manila, Hong Kong, Shadaloo. You try to justify your con games by telling yourselves... ...you've been stealing from criminals. Now, are you the same as Sagat and Bison? Or am I right, and you're different? We're different. Can we please leave? The only way you two are leaving is over my dead body. Say, anybody out there know what to do if a Bison trooper... ...throws a hand grenade right in your face? You pick it up, pull, and throw it right back at him. All right! Load them up! Move them out! I'm tired of being a warden. All right. Let's go. Go, move it. Take them to the harbor. The navy has a brig waiting for them. Bon voyage, Sagat. Enjoy the sea air. This isn't over, Guile. I own this city. Well, I'm the repo man. And you're out of business. Come on, let's move another truck up here. Cellblock D, get up. Move out. You just had to come to this country, didn't you, huh? Why'd I listen to you? You can't think, you can't fight. You know what I think? I'm sick of your crap. -Hey! Break it up! Get in the truck. -Get up, you son of a bitch. -Get in the truck. Come on! -All right. Next batch. Cellblock D, line up for the next truck. Come on, let's move another truck out. -Cellblock D, get up and move out. -Get it moving over here. -Ryu. Ken. Throw us the keys. -Go to hell. Forget our past. I can help you escape the city. -Let's go. Let's go! -Let's go, let's go! Go, go! Go! Let's go, let's go! Don't! You'll hit the colonel. Medics! Medics! Hey, hey, hey! Cool it. Hey, man. Come on. The temple above us was the wonder of the ancient world. Bisonopolis shall be the wonder of my world. But I think the food court should be larger. All the big franchises will want in. Dateline: Shadaloo City, Shadaloo, Southeast Asia. The world is in shock at the news that Colonel William F. Guile... ...has been killed. It happened just 30 minutes ago during a jailbreak by Victor Sagat... ...the gunrunner who was the principal arms supplier... ...for renegade General M. Bison. It was hoped that the Allied Nation forces would restore order here. But after today's tragedy, nothing is certain... ...except that Bison's mad threats will continue... ...and that the new A.N. commander's first order of business... ...is to bury Colonel Guile. For GNT, this is Chun-Li Zang. That's great news, general. Congratulations. On the contrary. I mourn. Okay. I was hoping to face Guile personally on the battlefield. One gentleman warrior to another... ...in respectful combat. Then I would snap his spine. The road not taken. But why? Why do they still call me a warlord? And mad? All I want to do is to create... ...the perfect genetic soldier. Not for power, not for evil... ...but for good. Carlos Blanka will be the first of many. They shall march out of my laboratory... ...and sweep away every adversary, every creed, every nation... ...until the very planet is in the loving grip... ...of the Pax Bisonica. And then peace will reign in the world... ...and all humanity shall bow to me... ...in humble gratitude. That was beautiful. Curfew violators will be arrested. Anyone resisting arrest will be shot. -Clear the press. -Yes, sir. -Clear the press. -Yes, sir. Our wireless mike. On the coastal highway, heading north. -Damn. We've got interference. -No, that's not interference. -It's too steady. -What's the problem? We're not the only ones who put a homing device on that truck. Well, let's analyze this other signal. Looks like that other signal is aimed right back here. A.N. headquarters. Here? That doesn't make any sense. -Your five minutes are up. Move out. -Honda. We gotta go, bro. Excuse me, bro. You two, follow our signal. I'll catch up with you at the Thieves' Market. I'll find out who's playing games with us. -Watch your back, Li. -I didn't know you cared. We don't. You're the only one who can sign our expense accounts. It's clear. Go. I want a shot of that truck. Looks like their pass is valid. -They're good for another week. -They can go. -It's about time. -Yeah. Another homing device. If I didn't give you an interview when I was alive... ...no way I'm gonna do it when I'm dead. Of course. Those two young men who led the prison break and killed you. They're working for you, aren't they? Are you asking as a reporter, or as something else? -Sergeant, take Ms. Zang into custody. -No, wait, wait. Wait, please. You're right. I'm not here just to cover the news. I don't want a story about Bison. I want his head. Now, it's taken me 20 years to get this far. You can't lock me up, not when I'm this close. -Take her away. -Yes, sir. No-- I knew you wouldn't understand. I understand better than you know. This war is not about your personal vendetta. It's about mine. Darling, basic black's not really you. Prison gray, perhaps? Hey! Stop! Hey, come back here! Where do you think you're going? Hey, stop! Stop! You don't have a chance. What a screw-up. Where is she? Back to 4, come on! What a woman. Cruise missile. All original. You add your own warhead. Armored personnel carrier, surplus from Iraqi army. Five speeds: two forward, three reverse. 1972 turbofan chopper. Like new. Only used once, to evacuate American embassy in Saigon. Go ahead, kick the tires. Welcome, warlords of Shadaloo. General Bison invites you to share his food, drink and entertainment. No, no, no. -Yeah! -No. No. No! She likes me. -How about our explosive finale? -Not yet. We have a problem. Now... ...to business. This place makes Detroit look like Disneyland. The only question is whose lowlifes are gonna kill us first... ...Sagat's or Bison's. You know, Guile was right. We've forgotten everything our sensei talked about. Trust, honor. Whatever you think, we're in this... ...until we get that homing device up to Bison's fortress. Ken? You got another one of those masks for me, darling? I am pleased with your goods, Sagat. Now, as for payment, why settle for mere money? After I defeat the A.N., what if I were to share the country with you? When the war is over, we'll see how much of the country is left. Meanwhile... ...let's see the color of your money. Enough! Is this a joke? This money isn't worth the paper it's printed on. On the contrary. Every Bison dollar will be worth 5 British pounds. That is the exchange rate the Bank of England will set... ...once I've kidnapped their queen. We know you're working for Colonel Guile. You may not believe me, but we're your friends. I must have been insane to think I could do business with you, Bison. You raving lunatic! I know you. You're Edmund Honda, the sumo from Hawaii. You almost made yokozuna. Until the Shadaloo Tong destroyed my reputation. They did the same thing to me and my boxing career. Don't tell me. Figure skating. All you need to know... ...is that the weapons and munitions Bison and Sagat deal in... ...are gonna blow them straight to hell. This conclave is over. You will die for this insult, Sagat. You've got 10 minutes. -Well, that was special. What? -Come on. We've got work to do. It's showtime. She said this place would blow in 10 minutes. Things can't get worse. -I was wrong, it got worse. -Ken, back me up. -General, you shouldn't be fighting-- -Sagat, loosen up, it's a party. -Are you with me or against me? -Is that multiple choice? You dare to interfere? Yeah. Because.... Because there are enemy spies everywhere among us, general. Show me these spies. This is Chun-Li Zang, and this may be my final broadcast. -But if it is, I and my comrades... -There. There they are. ...know we did not die in vain... ...for we will have ended the spirits of the two warlords... ...who have brought so much death and destruction... ...to this part of the world. Bison, Sagat. All your weapons of death are going to be blown sky-high. Happy landings. Quick, change the channel! Evacuate at once! Search the camp. Find Chun-Li! The technology of East and West. While their governments scorned me, their corporations adored me. Zangief, see that Ken and Ryu are given clean clothing. For it was they who first warned us of Chun-Li's treachery. They are our honored guests. Sagat, Vega, you are welcome to stay here. I think you will find the coming events most educational. General, what about them? Take these two to the interrogation room. They will talk or they will die. -Hey! -Preferably both. Take the journalist to my chambers. We have decided to grant her a private interview. -Get off me, man! Get off me. -Take it easy, pal. -Let's go. -Come on. Ken, Ryu, come with me. We take care of you. -This way. -Attention. Combat testing for all troopers will continue to be at random. You're gonna dehydrate yourself. -Targets and ammunition will be live. -Move! I said, move! This sucks. Those guys are good guys. Like us. Lately I don't feel very good. An attack from the air is impossible. The only chance is an assault with a small amphibious force. Here. The main force will come from the north... ...while a single vessel equipped with the latest in stealth technology... ...will come up this channel and distract his defenses from the east. -Colonel. -Yes? A single boat against everything he's got? The pilot would have to be out of his mind. Luckily, Bison has driven me crazy. So I'm gonna do it. Synchronize your watches, 0500. Cast off at 0600. This is it. Let's go. Let's do this. Let me show you how we treat foreigners in Shadaloo. -You are next, Yankee. -Maybe you ought to lie down first. Yeah. And take a bath. Oh, man. Oh, God. How do you keep from crying out? I'm sumo, bruddah. My body can be in one place, my mind another. Next time your mind leaves, tell it to bring back a pizza. Honda, give me your hand. We only been in jail two hours. Maybe next month. Give me your hand, fool. Ready? Go. Now you look like Bison troopers. This is where we train... ...in our glorious struggle against the Allied Nations' tyranny. -How you doing? -Hey, you're looking great. -Nice gun. -Hey, great uniform. -Long live Bison. -Yep, Bison. I see you later, in the commissary. You get a good look at that video map? Just got the left half. Good, I got the right. Troops, fall in. Attention. I'll handle this. As you were, colonel. What a surprise. Welcome to the Shadaloo front. You're just in time for the kickoff. I'm afraid not, colonel. The Security Council has just voted. -They've decided to negotiate. -You're joking. We think we can deal with General Bison. You're instructed to call off the assault. Contact him. Request an extension of his deadline. We are prepared to pay the ransom demand. Twenty billion dollars? What will prevent him from taking more hostages next month... ...and asking for 50 billion? One hundred billion? -Colonel, have you lost your mind? -No, you've lost your balls. Colonel Guile, deliver these instructions to your troops... ...and then consider yourself relieved of your command. Troopers. I just received new orders. Our superiors say the war is canceled. We can all go home. Bison is getting paid off for his crimes, and our friends who have died here... ...will have died for nothing. But we can all go home. Meanwhile, ideals like peace, freedom and justice... ...they get packed up... ...but we can all go home. Well, I'm not going home. I'm gonna get on my boat and I'm going upriver... ...and I'm going to kick that son of a bitch Bison's ass so hard... ...that the next Bison wannabe is gonna feel it. Now, who wants to go home... ...and who wants to go with me? -Come on, come on. -Let's go, colonel. Colonel Guile? Colonel Guile. Move it. Move it! Let's go, move, move. Come on! Colonel Guile! Colonel Guile. These instructions-- Stop them, please. Hey, I would love to, but some moron just canned me. It was 20 years ago. You hadn't promoted yourself to general yet. You were just a petty drug lord. You and your gang of murderers... ...gathered your small ounce of courage... ...to raid across the border for food, weapons... ...slave labor. My father was the village magistrate. A simple man with a simple code: justice. He gathered the few people that he could to stand against you. You and your bullies were driven back by farmers with pitchforks. My father saved his village... ...at the cost of his own life. You had him shot as you ran away. A hero at a thousand paces. I'm sorry, I don't remember any of it. You don't remember? For you, the day Bison graced your village... ...was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday. Attention, all troopers. Weapons inspections will continue to be at random until further notice. If your weapons are not at full battle readiness, penalties will be severe. -Those guys will be happy to see us. -Yeah. Well, if it isn't our little buddies who double-crossed us. Help me. What did he say? "Hail to M. Bison." These guys are fanatics. -We're on the same side. -No. I think he said he could meet us outside. What I said was, "We're on the same side." I spent the past 10 years working in the media world. Using it to gather intelligence on you. I found partners who hated you and your friends as much as I did. But most importantly, I studied the martial arts of three continents. So that one day I could meet you... ...avenge my father... ...and end your reign of terror myself. I don't think so. You see, no one has ever seen you in combat. You always hid behind your sumo and your boxer. Why, since you entered this country... ...you never even threw a single punch. No, my dear. I know women... ...and you are harmless. That's exactly what I wanted you to think. -Li! Hey, Li! Is that you, Li? -Li! We're coming, Li! -Hang on! -Li! No! Li, let me at him. Son of a-- It's gas! -Oh, no. -We gotta get out of here! Come on! I had him.... Attention, all boats. Stand by at attack vector Alpha. I'll take out the enemy radar. Captain Sawada, I'm counting on you. We'll be there, colonel. Just save some for us. Formation, attack. What's wrong? What's wrong with that? Subject's muscle mass increased by 71 percent. Subject's muscle mass increased by 72 percent. Subject's muscle mass increased by 73 percent. Oh, God! I have a dream that one day.... Attention, quartermaster. Uniforms and sidearms will be issued to the Shadaloo Tong by 1800 hours. -Move it, fat boy. Come on. -Move it, cutie. -Don't try anything. -I told you we couldn't trust them. Vega, be civil. They worked so hard to get here. Let them enjoy their ringside seats. You know, it's interesting. Had you worked together instead of against each other... ...you might have been successful. Colonel. We're approaching Bison's outer radar perimeter. Prepare for stealth mode. -Online. -Systems ready. Armed. Three, two, one, now. -Enemy radar position coming up, sir. -And it's going down. General. Something very strange on the river. Two of our radar stations just went down. Go to visual. System alert. Radar stations 2 and 3 are off-line. Confirm and rectify. Radar stations are off-line. Activate sonar detectors and filter all inputs. Colonel, someone's picked us up. Stealth mode detected. -They're jamming us. -System failure. Stealth mode compromised, sir. We're busted. They know we're coming. Alert, alert. Intruder craft detected adjacent to Radar Station 7. Prepare for attack mode. Intruder at Radar Station 7. Yellow alert. Off-duty personnel, report at once to shift commanders. Repeat: yellow alert. Perimeter guns, fire. This is General Bison. Our defenses are locked on to you. -Identify yourself. -This is the collection agency, Bison. Your ass is six months overdue, and it's mine. -Guile? Alive? -Of course! His death was designed to ingratiate his spies with you. I guess you didn't see that, did you? This time, colonel, you die for real. Attention, attention. Stand clear. Stand clear. And now, Miss Zang... ...you will witness firsthand the power that you spurned. -Minefield ahead. -They have proximity sensors. Oh, great. Colonel, they have a radar lock. Thirty seconds, we're gonna be swimming. In that case, let's get an early start. Game over! Intruder destroyed. Intruder destroyed. Stand down from yellow alert. Repair crews to Radar Stations 1 through 6. Estimated time to repair radar net: three hours and 20 minutes. -What are you doing? -Nothing. I have a dream today. Nothing, eh? Security, this is the lab-- So you think you're smart, eh? Let's see how smart you are when you're not breathing! Come on. Yes, yes, Madame Secretary. I gave him the orders. The man's impossible. No. No, no, I stopped him from taking all the soldiers. The rest of the army's back at the base. T. Hawk. What's with the headband? It's Cherokee. I wear it for good luck in battle. You should have brought three of them. Colonel, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. -Is the rope secure? -Almost. Four years of ROTC for this shit. It is now only moments from the deadline set by General M. Bison... ...for delivery of the $20 billion ransom... ...he has demanded for the hostages. Reports from Shadaloo itself are unclear... ...and GNT correspondent Chun-Li Zang has been reported missing... ...along with her news crew. We are hopeful for a peaceful solution to this crisis... ...and we appeal to General Bison in the name of humanity. For GNT, this is Sander Vanocur. Dee Jay, has the A.N. deposited the 20 billion in my Swiss bank? Hell, no, general. Sir, we've set the electronic and visual markers. -ETA landing zone: 12 minutes. -Roger, lieutenant. I'll be ready. If I'm alive. Open the hostage chamber. Hostage pit open. Stand clear. Stand clear. Hostage pit open. Charlie, it's me. I'm your friend William. William. Friend? -Friend. -William. Friend. What have they done to you? Charlie? Me friend. What have they done to me? Help me. Help me. -I'll help you. -Help me.... I'll help you. And then I'll make them pay. Friend. No. You have no right. The world thought very little of you, my dear guests. Too little to pay the pittance I asked for. Too little to even mount a decent rescue attempt. Move out! Your masters at the A.N. call me a wild beast. So be it. You do not deserve... ...the martial dignity of a firing squad. No. You shall be killed by a wild beast! A beast born of my own genius! Raise the incubation chamber. It was Bison's scientists who warped his body. I did what I could to preserve his mind, to keep him human. You call this human? His mind retains the capacity for good. Yes, and for evil as well. Will you kill him because... ...he has difficulty understanding the difference? Stand clear. Incubation chamber rising to command-room level. The signal. The real monster's upstairs. He expects to see his creation. Stand clear. Incubation chamber rising to command-room level. Behold the face of your destruction, and of my victory. Yes! Shoot the hostages! -Hostage pit closing. Stand clear. -Push it down! "Fat boy" this! Go! Red alert. Red alert. All personnel, report to battle stations. Battle stations. Report to battle stations at once. You wouldn't happen to have our passports? Get the hostages free and I'll get you two first-class tickets home. Go! Go, cowards! Come on, go! All that's left is revenge. Find Ken and Ryu and get the hostages out. Hey! Goodbye! -We'll do what we can. -Okay. Go. Attention, all troopers. Remember that maintaining... ...your health-plan benefits is your responsibility. Mainframe SCSI link has been severed. Where is Blanka? I don't know, general. Everything's crashing. He's fighting my men! The cerebral programming. Quick, patch it in here. No! Now, now! Keep moving! Let's rock 'n' roll, gents. Then defeat is a possibility. Very well. We shall face it together, Dee Jay. With the stoicism of the true warrior. Battle systems are compromised. Repair time: 18 months. -Sayonara, buddy. -Come on, let's go. -Where you going, man? -What are you, nuts? Ryu, Guile put a gun to our head. We did our part. The real soldiers are here and we're gone. What's wrong with you, man? There's people fighting. Dying. Yeah, they get paid for it, we don't. Now, you coming with me or not? Maybe before this place blows up, we can find something worthwhile. No, thanks. I already found something worthwhile. -I don't understand. -I know you don't. Stop! Stop! Sir. We're pushing back the enemy, but there's skirmishes on every level. Still no sign of Bison. He's probably hiding. Hiding? What do I have to fear from you? Worker ants scurrying about with their pitiful weapons. Afraid of the purity of unarmed combat. Come out from behind the curtain, wizard. Let's see how pure your combat really is. Come on. Sir, no, that's exactly what he wants. No, T. Hawk. That's what we both want. Am I right, Bison? Are you man enough to fight with me? Anyone who opposes me will be destroyed. -Colonel, you can't! -Oh, yes, I can. Just take the hostages out. If I'm not topside in 15 minutes, evacuate without me. -Both of you. That's an order. -Move out! All right, men. You heard him. Move out! Troopers, out. Throw the enemy into the sea. Leave us. -You have made me a happy man. -Next, I'll make you a dead one. Captain Sawada, sir. We've tapped into the enemy security system. Excellent. Show it to me at once. This could be strategically important. -You'll have to do better than that. -Okay. That's for Charlie. That's for the soldiers. Come on. The hostages. Where are they? Now, then, where are those hostages? -CQ, this is Guile. -Cammy here. Are you all right? -I'm okay. I'm just half dead. -And Bison? -All dead. What's the situation? -Fighting in every corridor, sir. What about the reserves? Have they arrived yet? Sawada's reinforcements are hitting the beachhead. They have their hands full with the enemy outside the fortress. -It could still go either way. -It's gonna go our way. Have our troops on the upper levels fall back. We'll trap them outside between our columns. We'll do it, colonel. But we still haven't found the hostages yet. I've got some volunteers on it. And maybe they'll be able to help. Colonel, I didn't read the last part. Colonel, are you there? Yes. My mama didn't raise no fool, baby. Oh, man. I should have stayed at Microsoft. All personnel, report to battle stations. Battle stations. Report to battle stations at once. There's gotta be something. Okay. Where's the old front door? Ryu, where you going? Ryu. Hang a U-ie, amigo. You're walking into a trap! Ryu, get out of there! Ryu! -Vega. -Where were we? You were losing. A weapon, Bison? What happened to the purity of unarmed combat? This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely you've heard of it. It levitates bullet trains from Tokyo to Osaka. It levitates my desk, where I ride the saddle of the world. And it levitates me. Something wrong, colonel?
