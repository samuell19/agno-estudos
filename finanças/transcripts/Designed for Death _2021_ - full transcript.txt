Don't hang... [unintelligible breathy lyrics] Was that your wife I heard? What are you doing with her? [Soft music] Did you lie to me? No, you told me you were not getting back with her. You promised, you promised... You promised me. [Unintelligible breathy lyrics] How dare you hang up on me. Answer the phone now!

[Betty] Don't... that's not recycling, honey. Just put it... No, that's garbage. You know what? I'll take care of it tomorrow. Don't worry. Well, remember what I always say. If another guy didn't work out, don't let it get to you. He probably wasn't good enough for you anyway, right? Betty, I can't deal with this right now. [Betty] But I know you're u...

Oh, hi, uh, call me Jim. You must be Ms. Andor? - Oh, call me Ava. - Welcome, Ava. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. Wow, this... this is very, um... Yeah, I... I know, that's why I called you. I need an interior decorator. Um, I saw your website. Everything about it said cool, classy, elegant. Looks really great. So, Jim... What can I do for you? Well, I... I want a place that I can be proud to show friends, business associates. But more importantly, a place that says... home. Can you do it in a week? I mean, is that doable? Wow, uh, you know what, I really need... Yeah, I'm sorry, you need more time. I wasn't thinking, I'm sorry about that. Um, we can just, uh... You know, maybe you'd like to consult with your wife first. [Jim] Oh, uh, that won't help. She's in Europe with our daughter at the moment. Oh, it's a vacation? [Jim] Uh, no, she, uh, promotes medical patents. Um, travels a lot, it takes up a lot of time, so things are kind of in flux at the moment. [Ava] Jim, I would absolutely love to do this for you. Such great news, thank you. Well, I imagine you have colors you like, themes, styles, anything that would help. Themes and styles, I don't know. Um, if you lived here, what would you do? And whatever that is, do that. I trust ya. That's... that's really generous of you. Okay, well, I'm gonna get started. Why don't you show me to the bedroom? Yeah, uh, sorry, uh, down here, first door on the right. - Okay. - Last door on the right. [Ava] Okay, let me just take one last measurement. Okay, perfect. So, uh, I'll draw up a proposal for you, get you some numbers and details and... - Okay. - We'll need to... to meet again. Here you go. How does tomorrow after five sound? After five is great. - Okay. - It's a date. It's a date. [Laughs] - Bye. - Thank you. [Young Ava] And you're gonna live in an amazing, beautiful house that I'll make for you. You're never gonna leave me and I'll never leave you. [Tense music] [Betty] Hey, girl, how you doin'? Hey, Betty, how's it goin'? Well, that was a quick rebound. Hm. - Night, Mr. Kellens. - Night, Tommy. Oh, Nancy, do you know if the septic tank diagram went to press? Manufacturer needs it in metric and French now too. - Oh yeah, I'll take care of it. - Great. - Are you gonna lock up? - Yeah. Goodnight. Am I too early or too late? Uh, you're right on time. Come in, have a seat. [Soft music] [Jim sighs] Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Welcome to the glamorous world of kellens publishing. [Chuckles] Can't complain, it's paid the bills since before I was born. And my dad always said, "people will always need to be told what to do." [Ava chuckles] [Chuckling] Wow, instruction manuals. So I guess I have you to blame when I can't figure out where that screw goes on the bookcase. [Jim laughs] No, we create mostly for medical, manufacturing, military, aerospace, um... ooh! This right here... [Drawer squeaking open, shut] Was my father's pride and joy. Created this manual for NASA. Copy of that orbited the moon. [Ava] Wow. Uh, you said medical. Is that how you met your wife? Yeah, we had a contract with a local medical manufacturing company where she worked before she took the job she has now. The traveling job? Yeah, yeah. I'm hoping this remodel will make things a little happier at home, you know? Bet you think this whole place should be redone, huh? [Jim chuckles] But this here was my dad's desk and I keep it the way he did. But he was a real "my way or the highway" kind of guy. Did he... did he pass a while ago? [Jim] Uh, no, eight months. [Ava] Oh, I'm sorry. My mother actually passed away when I was 17. Only child, I never met my father. Yeah, I was pretty lucky to have him around. Coffee? Oh, only if it's no trouble. [Jim] No, no trouble at all. I'm in the presence of a self-made entrepreneur. [Jim chuckles] No, but I am, I'm really impressed with... with your website. Before and afters and... How you come up with all that - is truly amazing to me. - Well, as a child, I had a talent for working with color and fabric. I used to make beautiful things for my mother, but... She never really liked anything. Hm, tough critic, huh? Yeah... yeah. But I knew someday someone would understand how I could see the beauty in things and let me decide where they go. [Jim] Well, I promise you, I will be your easiest client yet. [Chuckling] Great, well, I pulled some ideas. I just need to get some approvals. No, uh, no need. Like I said the other day, just imagine you live there and make it a home that you would feel safe and loved in and a place that you'd never want to leave. Um, I made you a key. Here you go. And that's my budget. It's a little bit more than what you quoted on the phone when we spoke, but I figure since it's a rush job, you know... I hope it's sufficient. It's... it's really more than enough. Well, I'll have workmen coming in and out next week, and I'll be there to supervise and make sure everything goes perfectly. And I'll just check into a hotel - until it's done. - That sounds good. Great. Well... [Chuckling] I can't tell you how much this means to me. [Ava] Well, someday you might. - Bye. - Goodnight. [Sighs] [Zach] Yeah, I know the odds are 12-to-1, all right, but I'm feeling lucky today. Hey, you guys, get inside. Go set up. Look, all of it, man, come on. You know I'm good for it. I'm on a job right now, okay? I'm gonna get paid on Friday, I'll have the money for you then. Yeah. You still betting on a losing team, Zach? Look, I'll get the money for you, okay? - Look, I've got... - if you wanna keep your job, I suggest you get inside... now. I'll call you back. [Phone beeps] [Soft music] [Zach] You know, whoever owns this joint's got good taste. [Ava] No, they don't. I chose everything beautiful in this house. Everything. So when do I get to see you again? We had good times, right? Goodbye, Zach. Yeah, sure. Okay. [Tense music] [Darlene] Knock-knock. [Doorbell rings] - Hi, can I help you? - Oh, wow. This is wonderful! Wow. I'm sorry, I'm Darlene. I work with Miranda. Jim's wife. - Oh. - Jim said he was redoing the place, but this is serious. Wow. You really know your stuff. Great job. - Well, thank you. - Yeah. Well, I need to get back to work. I just actually dropped this off for Ms. Miranda. It's from Jim's favorite bakery. Oh, well, it looks exquisite. Where is it from? It's from a hole in the wall in the downtown area. The address is on the box. And you know what, if you blink you just might miss it. [Laughs] - But, okay. - You know, it's probably none of my business, but, from what Jim told me, it sounded like he and his wife were sort of... Separated? They've been going back and forth for quite some time now. They really do make a great couple. I'm sure. You see these hearts? I felt that it was appropriate. [Ava] Nice touch. I'm sure he'll love it. [Darlene] Yeah. [Door opens] [Vocalist] ♪ count the days ♪ [Soft music] [Young Ava] You're gonna be so happy when you see the house. I'll make it so beautiful.

[Ava giggles] [Jim] Oh my goodness. - Come here. - Can't believe - how good it looks. - Really? - I don't know what to say. - Come on, sit down. This couch. [Ava laughs] Come on, it's perfect. [Ava] I'm so glad you like it. I think it's gonna be perfect for when we entertain our... I mean, when you entertain your friends. Sit down a second, there's something - I want to tell you. - Oh, um, you know, there's actually something important I... I want to tell you too. Oh, well, ladies first. Okay, um, I'm not really sure how to say this, - but I really... - oh, that's what I was gonna tell you about. Wow, they're back early. - They? - My wife and daughter just got off a plane from Rome. [Dark music] - What do you think? - Wow. - Chelsea, what do you think? - It's awesome, dad. [Miranda] What got into you, Jim? [Jim] I wanted us to have a fresh start. Thought this might help. Oh, uh, this is Ava. She's the decorator who did all this, it was all her idea. [Jim chuckles] Check out the bedrooms, they're all... [Ava's mother] Give me the doll, Ava. [Chatter] It's nice. [Ava's mother] What a mess. [Eerie sounds] Clean this up. [Jim] We're going to our favorite restaurant tomorrow with some friends. Join us. Oh, I... I... I appreciate that, but I... I... Yeah, I mean, of course, Saturday night. Oh, uh, what was it you wanted to tell me? Oh, just that it was such a pleasure to work for you. Thank you so much, you did a fantastic job. I'm so happy. I mean, we all are. Uh, purse, don't forget your purse. Okay. [Soft music] [Ava's mother] Don't forget, you have a roof over your head and a mommy who loves you, and that is all you need. [Miranda] It's nice. - "It's nice." - I wanted us to have - a fresh start. - "It's nice!" [Jim] We're going to our favorite restaurant tomorrow with some friends, join us. [Sobbing] Favorite restaurant. Tomorrow, Saturday night. [Panting] [Sniffles] [Young Ava] I love you even though you're broken. [Panting] [Tense music] [Miranda] Chels, don't forget to lock the door. [Miranda gasps] You're wearing those shoes. She got those in Rome. - Oh, really? - Aren't they fantastic? [Jim] Those Italian? [Dark music] From Rome? Oh, okay, so they're not Italian. Oh, buckle up. [Engine starts] [Tense music] [Static] [Young Ava] You're gonna live in an amazing, beautiful house that I'll make for you. I'll make it so beautiful, like you've never seen it before. There's gonna be so many cool things in the house that you're gonna love. [Eerie music] [Sped-up camera audio] [Miranda exhales] Yeah, I know, Darlene, but you are gonna do so great without me. Besides, you can call me if you need anything, okay? Thank you so much. Okay. Bye. Hey. - Hey. - So, it sounds like Darlene is going to be catching the afternoon flight to New York tomorrow because she's gonna be picking up my routes. So, um, I'm gonna be home a little more. That okay with you? I think you'd make me a very happy man. [Chuckling] You know, you didn't have to redo the house - to get me to stay. - Didn't I? [Jim] Aren't you glad I did though? [Miranda] Yes. - But? - But I kind of miss my comforter. My quilt. You know what? Roll. - Pull. - What? [Jim] Pull, pull, roll, roll. Peel, peel, peel, peel. What are we doing? [Jim] Right there. Catch, toss. Catch, toss. Catch, toss. Catch, toss. [Miranda laughs] Okay, lay down. [Intense music] - What? - Lay down. - What? - Flat, lay down. Incoming. [Jim grunts] One. [Jim grunts] Two. [Miranda] You kept it all? [Jim grunts] Of course I kept it. [Miranda] Yes! [Jim chuckles] You're the best. [Jim exclaims] [Jim] My majesty. [Miranda] Captain. [Miranda moans] Right there, right there, on my neck. Kiss my neck. [Grunting, moaning] Oh, my captain! Bite my neck. [Panting] [Jim] My majesty. [Panting] [Moaning] [Ava screams] [Ava sobs] [Ava] I hate you. [Grunting] [Sniffling] [Gasps] I know, Darlene, but you are gonna do so great without me. [Moaning] [Darlene] Yes, I'll be covering all the routes for Miranda. Oh, and I need you to book me in business class to New York. Tomorrow afternoon. Send me the confirmation once you have it. Okay, thanks. Bye. [Ava grunts, thud] [Darlene grunting softly] [Music intensifies] [Liquid glugging, splashing] [Jim] It's my father's pride and joy. He created this manual for NASA. A copy of that orbited the moon. [Strikes lighter] [Flames crackling] [Cell phone ringing] Hey, Tommy. What's up? What? - What's going on? - Now to breaking news, an intense fire... [Newscaster] Within minutes, we've seen the rooftop completely collapse. [Ava] Rewind. Pause. - Play. - Not sure what's fueling - the fire, but it is raging... - all your dad's stuff. [Newscaster] With some serious ferocity. It's gonna be a huge effort here tonight. I should get down there and see the damage. - Get this Blaze under control. - No, no, you just stay. [Newscaster] Thanks for that. If you're just joining us now, we are covering a four-alarm fire. I should have updated the electric years ago. [Newscaster] Firefighters were called in around 1:00 A.M., - and now almost an hour later... - Did you see my shoes? - To contain this Blaze. - Behind the door. [Newscaster] Fortunately, the fire chief has been able to reach the office manager, Tommy Wazenski, who's ensured all staff... [Jim] I'll call you when I find out. - I love you. - I love you too. [Newscaster] This time, let's hope it stays that way. This fire is intense. What a dangerous job. We wish our firefighters well as they risk their lives to keep us safe. - I see you've already packed. - Jim, we talked about this. [Jim] So you made your decision? You're choosing your career over your family again? [Miranda] Jim, Darlene got mugged, okay? I'm the one who can take her place. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you right now. I'm doing this for us. I have to work. [Jim] You're blaming me for my office burning down? [Miranda] No, I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying I have to go and work. - I need you to support me. - I am supporting you... [Chelsea] Guys, please don't start again! Mom doesn't want to go back on the road. She has to. Darlene was mugged! - No, she's choosing to leave. - She's not choosing anything. [Jim] She is choosing to leave us again. I have to go. I don't have time. [Jim] Go. I love you. I love you. Have a good trip. [Soft music] [Vehicle engine starts] [Fountain flowing] [Dark music] [Doorbell rings] Ava, hey, whoa, whoa, what a surprise. - Thank you. - What is this? [Ava] I... I feel like I didn't properly thank you for the job. This is from my favorite bakery. - It's my favorite too. - Really? - Yeah! - Oh my god, you didn't have to bring anything. - Yeah, I did. - No. It's really nice to see you again. You too. Uh, Chelsea, Ava's here. - Come on in. - Okay. Did the fire just destroy everything? We back things up to a cloud, so creative properties are safe, but, um, I mean, all my dad's stuff - is gone for good. - That's terrible. Um, but I've been meaning to tell you that I love what you did with my bedroom. - Did you really? - Yeah. I think most kids my age would freak if someone touched their stuff, but you just knew what to do somehow. - Oh, I'm so glad you loved it. - Yeah, it was perfect. - I had so much fun. - She's right, you have a... A unique gift of seeing beauty in everything. It's really special. It really is. Listen. Let me re-design your office. But I do have one condition. I want Chelsea to be my assistant. - W-What? - What do you think? - Why? - Well, you do have artistic leanings. - She does. - Dad. [Jim] Don't be modest. You do. - Good. - But let me secure the new space and then... [Ava] You and me are gonna get to work. [Chelsea] Okay, I'm so excited. [Ava] Check it out. What do you think of that? Thank you for asking this one to help you. It's my pleasure. So now for a seating arrangement, let's do a perimeter of desks with computers and then, you know, we could put... We could put a coffee nook with this material - into the divider. - Yeah, I like it. And then we can have a front office and then Jim's office in the back. [Eerie ambient noise] The all-important boss's desk. [Chuckles] [Ava] I could make those dark wood chairs... With leather-covered arms. [Chelsea] Maybe we could do teal as an accent color. [Chelsea's speaking fades] [Eerie music] [Jim] It's a date. I think your dad is gonna love it. [Laughs] Okay, so let's... let's go to the floors. - Okay. - What do you think - about this one? - It... it looks... it looks good. [Ava] This for the rugs and this one for the floor. [Zach] Look, I just need an advance for this week. [Ava] Are you gonna win big on a bet? Are you gonna cut me in or take me to Vegas? We know how that worked out. Ava, come on, all right? This is serious. I'm in trouble here and I need your help. [Ava] I'm your boss, Zach, I'm not a loan shark. And my clients are coming, I need you to get your crew, get to work, and get out of here, okay? I'm not your mother, I'm not gonna take care of you anymore. Now go. Jess, come on. Grab those, let's go. You start in the back. I'll be up front, all right? [Chelsea] We're putting up new signage. Oh, and look, they're putting up the address numbers I designed. - Aren't those cool? - Very. [Chelsea] It looks like they're still working, but, dad, it's gonna be so cool. There's gonna be a coffee nook and all this new stuff. Come here, come on, come in. Welcome to kellens publishing. They're... they're still working outside, but I had them do your office first - so you could get back to work. - Wow, it's like a fresh start. [Jim] I wanted to have a fresh start. - Thank you. - Well, thank Chelsea. She's responsible for this room. - Well, you did pick the chair. - Well, you did approve it. [Chelsea] It's so amazing seeing all my ideas become a reality. [Ava] Oh, I do have one note. [Dark music] A very special piece to transition from old to new. And what is it that I always say? You always need an accent piece. [Jim] Oh, an accent piece. - Mm-hm. - Okay. [Ava] Check it out. - I open it? - Open it up. Oh, I like it. I like it, it's cute. Oh my goodness. Wow, look at that. That's beautiful. [Jim sighs] [Cell phone rings] Hey, babe. It's your mom. - What? - Is everything okay? [Jim] Yeah, hold on a second. Everything's fine. Um, I'll be back. [Chelsea] So, I want to tell you something. - I haven't even told dad yet. - Okay, what is it? I've decided to switch my major from pre-med to design. I want to be an interior decorator like you. - Are you sure? - A thousand percent, yeah. [Ava] Well, isn't your mom in medical technology? I mean, wouldn't she want you to do the same thing? - Wouldn't she be disappointed? - No, not at all. She's super cool and supportive. [Glove snaps] She really wants me to just be happy. [Ava's mother] You have a mommy who loves you. [Dramatic music] It's nice. Hey, I have an idea. [Jim] Okay, well, I don't understand. You don't know when you're coming back, do you? Terrific. You do that. - What? - Mm-hm. - Seriously. - Absolutely. [Chelsea] Ah, oh my god, dad, I have such great news. Do you want... Oh, is something wrong? [Jim] No, your mom's just not coming back when we thought she was. - No big deal. - Oh. - Um... - Okay. Well, what was your news? [Chelsea] Oh, Ava offered me a job, like a real job working for her. Just part time. It's not gonna interfere with college. [Chelsea] Where I've decided to switch my major to design. Rea... you're switching your major to design. - That... that's great. - So excited. [Jim] That's wonderful. Well, on that note, how 'bout we go out and celebrate? - I'll take you ladies to lunch. - Okay. Let me just, uh, grab my bag and I'll meet you outside. - Okay. - Okay. [Jim] All right. [Soft music] - You're all grown up. - I know, it's gonna be so... - Design? - Yeah! [Ava] Hey, I'm pulling you off the job. What... what? You've gotta be kidding me. [Ava] Just calm down, okay? My house in two hours. I got a better job for you. - Found it! - What about that Mexican place - down the street? - Yeah. [Birdsong] [Zach] I don't know, don't one of your clients need a wall painted or some wallpaper put up? Do you want 500 bucks or not? A thousand. No, never mind. I'll do it. 500 bucks. And show up at this guy's office and... Ah, we'll go over what to say. Okay. [Ava] Wear this. And go take a shower. You stink. You gonna join me? - No. - Come on, why do you always do this to yourself? It always ends up the same with these married guys. Get ready, shower, and do what I say. Now go dress up like a good boy. [Eerie music] Yes, ma'am. [Door shuts] [Betty] Come on, Missy! [Shakes bag of treats] Where are you? [Vehicle door shuts, engine starts] [Soft, tense music] - Jim kellens, I presume. - Yeah, welcome. - Do you have an appointment? - No. - I'm Derek. - Nice to meet you, Derek. There's that hospitality I've heard so much about. You have a nice place here, Jim. Better than the last office. Very tasteful, you know? [Jim] Is there something I could help you with or? [Zach] You see, Jim, Miranda's sort of let me down. Calls me about an hour ago and dumps me. [Chelsea] Dad? Dad, I got us dinner. Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were in a meeting. No, no, I'm not, honey. Wait in the office, I'll be there in a minute. - No problem. - You know, Jim, the road is a dangerous place for any woman. - That's a good point. - I'm gonna ask you - to leave. - She called you, too, didn't she? Said she wasn't coming home. See, I'm here to square things off and break even. Miranda hurt me so I'm here to hurt her back. Her majesty likes her neck kissed? [Miranda] Oh, my captain! Bite my neck! - Your majesty. - "Your majesty." [Zach] Any of this ringing your bottom bells... [Ava cackling] Captain? You know what, I need you to leave now. [Cackling] [Zach] I'm trying to do you two a favor. Oh, one more thing. You should probably watch your back. [Chelsea] Dad, why didn't you tell me? - I defended her! - I don't know. I don't know who that guy was... - I can't believe this! - Chelsea, please, I don't know what that was all about. Call her. [Dialing cell phone] Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. - Hey. - Miranda. Yes! [Miranda] I'm so glad you called. - I feel so bad about... - yeah, yeah, your little boyfriend just dropped by - on my office. - My what? - Derek. - Honey, this is a really fun game, but I am in the middle of a meeting, okay? What is it you wanted to tell me? That is what I wanted to tell you. Oh, and Chelsea was there too. It's a pity that she had to hear all that. Jim, I don't know anyone by the name of Derek. Derek seemed to know all about you, that you like your neck kissed and to be called your majesty. Why couldn't you just tell me what was going on? Yeah, Miranda, why didn't you just tell him? [Miranda] And I don't know how he would know those things. - Yeah, but he did. - We'll get to the bottom of it, but I have to get back to this meeting, okay? [Phone beeps] Jim? Bye, Miranda. I am so sorry, I have a family emergency. I'm gonna have to head back early. [Chelsea] Mom, please, please stop calling, okay? - Listen to me! - And stay away from the house. - Dad is heartbroken. - What? Someone is playing a really bad prank. This doesn't make any sense. [Chelsea] Mom, I'm at school, I can't have this conversation. I have to go. Chelsea, I would never do that to our family. [Chelsea] I saw the guy, okay? And I heard things that I really didn't need to hear. [Miranda] Look, your dad and I have had our problems, okay, but I would... I would never cheat on him. Mom, mom, I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. [Phone beeps] [Somber music] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Horn beeps] Hey. Okay, so, check this out. I got the blueprint for your dad's office. I made a couple changes to your ideas, but I think it's still gonna be... Chels, what? What... what's wrong? My mom is cheating on my dad. Oh my gosh. Oh, wow, that's terrible. I promised him I wouldn't say anything, but... I never thought this would happen. I don't know what to do, I just don't know what to do. [Re-rolling blueprint] Honey, listen. I'm gonna tell you what to do, okay? You're gonna throw yourself into your work. People are gonna hurt you and they're gonna disappoint you, but if you work hard, really, really hard, you're not gonna notice it as much. - Trust me. - Okay. My mother taught me that. Okay, so you're gonna pull yourself together, because we have a job to do, and you're gonna be great. - Okay? - Okay. Yeah. Your parents are gonna work it out. [Engine starts] [Darlene] We've been over this 10 times. The assault took place at night right in front of my house. It wasn't at a bar or restaurant where I could see them. It was one person. I have uninsured bodily injury coverage. Don't tell me that you're not gonna cover my hospital bills. What's the point of paying for insurance if they're gonna play these silly games? I am so sorry you have to deal with that. - And now here I am. - Don't be ridiculous. What's going on? Chelsea just told me she doesn't want me at the house. What? Yeah. I don't understand, Darlene. I would never cheat on Jim. Of course you wouldn't. [Miranda] I have nothing to go on. This Derek guy, he... he knows things, intimate things about Jim and I. Look, Miranda, I... Do you think that Jim could be making all of this up? Why would he do that? [Darlene] I don't know, to set you up for the big divorce? To see someone else without guilt? None of this is making any sense. No, he just spent all that money doing up the house so that I would stay there. - He... he... - and you're never there. I don't know. A man's gonna find a way to get what he needs. Look, stop by his office to see if he has a new secretary. Really, Darlene? He might be fixing up that house for another woman. [Zach] Do you think I'm stupid? [Ava] What are you doing? - You used me! - Get inside! - You used me. - Get inside. You should have seen this guy's face. His jaw just dropped when I hit him with it, like it was unbelievable. You had to have been there. I mean, 500 bucks to break up a marriage. - That's all? - I didn't break it up. - It was on its last legs. - Do you think sending in some guy in a cheap suit, a cheap suit, and spitting off lines like a bad actor? Get your hands off me. Look, I'll give you another $500, that's the thousand you wanted. - It's $10k now. - I don't have ten. Don't lie to me. You want the wife out of the way so you can have Jimmy boy all to yourself. [Slap] [Ava] I gave you a job, you did it, and now we're done. [Zach] It's $10k and I leave. - I don't have ten. - Don't lie to me. Or I go back and tell Jimmy boy the truth. He'll never believe you. He's in love with me now. [Ava grunts] [Zach] Yeah, maybe he won't... But his wife will. I got her number. [Dialing phone] [Phone rings] - Hello? - Yeah, Mrs. Kellens. - I'm sorry, who's this? - My name is Zach, and I've got some information... [thud, grunt] Uh, hello? [Phone beeps] [Betty] Ava? [Knocking] Ava! [Shaking door] I'm really worried, I forgot my key. Wake up, Zach, wake up, wake up. - What is the problem? - Wake up. [Betty] You know what? I'm gonna call the police! [Beeping] I'm calling the police! What do you want, Betty? I mean, are you okay? I... I got concerned, I thought you were hurt. No, I'm just... I'm having a fight with my boyfriend. W-Well, it sounded so... Oh, it sounded serious. [Dark music] [Ava] Well, that's what happens when you have a fight, Betty. [Betty] My word, I was scared for you. I thought you... Oh, no, you need to go home. [Betty] Well, thank you, and... - Goodbye. - Okay, good. I'll see you tomorrow! I love you, bye! Okay, have a good night! [Ava's mother] Oh, Ava, you can fool Betty, but you can't fool me. [Ominous music] Oh, no, what a mess. Clean this up. [Ava grunts] Don't forget. [Ava groans] You have a roof over your head. [Ava grunting] And a mommy who loves you. [Groans] And that is all you need. [Phone ringing] [Beep] Hi, Jim. [Jim] Hi, Ava, um, listen, I know this is... It's kind of sudden, but, um... No, no. [Jim] I have reservations for two at that new restaurant that opened up by the office. Um, client canceled on me. Some family thing or something like that. But anyway, I was thinking, you know, if you're free, maybe we could, uh, go and officially celebrate the new office. Okay! I could send a car to pick you up if you're free. Yeah, I am, actually. Okay, great. Fantastic. I will, uh... Just text me your address and I will set it up. [Ava] Okay, I'll see you there. [Jim] Okay, I'll see you then. All right, bye. Bye. [Phone beeps] [Cheery music] [Young Ava] You're never gonna leave me, and I'll never leave you. [Cheery music] [Darlene] You don't have to do this, you're spoiling me. [Winces] Easy, easy. [Miranda] You are putting a roof over my head, so it's the least I can do. How is that girl you trained? Ugh, I don't even want to talk about it. Jim just texted me and, um, asked me to come and get the rest of my stuff. [Darlene] Oh, hell no. None of that texting mess. Are you gonna go to his office like I told you to? Go there and demand proof of the affair. Interrogate his employees too. [Miranda] You know, I got the weirdest call yesterday. [Birds chirping] From? [Ominous music] [Miranda] I don't know, some guy named Zach. [Groaning] Called me Mrs. Kellens... Then he started to ask me something, but... then there was a bunch of screaming and smashing, and then the phone went dead. But I tried the number back, and there's no answer. [Groaning] I'm starting to wonder if it has something to do with that Derek guy. [Breathing heavily] [Darlene] You need to try reverse phone lookup. What's that? [Darlene] You can go online and find out who owns that phone number. How do you know this stuff? [Darlene] I got you. [They laugh] - I'll send you the link. - Oh, please send me the link. Okay, now hold that. - Ouch. - Sorry. [Dark music] [Door closes] [Jim] I gotta be honest with you, Ava. I surprised myself by inviting you out tonight. [Ava] When we talked that night in your office, I saw how much pain Miranda's absence was causing you. My mother wasn't an easy woman to love. After she died, I had to change and ultimately do what makes me happy and not someone else. [Jim] Been afraid to be on my own a long time. [Ava] And now you're brave enough to realize it. [Door opens] [Jim] Yeah, I mean, you're right. - Where's Chelsea, is she here? - No, she's at a friend's. Oh. [Tranquil music] You want something to drink? Um... No, let's... Let's go sit on the couch. We can, uh, turn the fireplace on. [Fire crackles] [Belt clinking] I'm a married man. Unhappily. And isn't life... too short to be unhappy? [Dramatic music] [Unintelligible breathy lyrics] [Insects chirring] [Traffic humming] [Dark music] [Betty] Miss kitty? Kitty, kitty. Kitty, come on. Come on, sweet girl. Well, somebody ate the food. [Ava] Bye, Jim! I'll see you tomorrow night. I'll make dinner! [Car driving away] [Footsteps] [Keys jingling] [Engine starting] [Betty] Oh, no. Sweetie... What are you doing now? [Traffic humming] [Solemn music] How long have you been on this beat? [Laughter] Oh, there she is! We've been neighbors her whole life. Ava! [Ominous music] Hi, Ava. [Birds chirping] Officer Betts. Ava andor? [Ava] Yes, officer? [Officer Betts] Sorry to bother you, but, uh, do you happen to know this gentleman? Oh, yeah, that's... That's Zach Tully. He works for me, sometimes as a painter or a carpenter. Oh, well, his roommate said that he was supposed to show up for another job today, and he didn't, and he also said that he was coming here to get money from you to pay for his rent. Yeah, he did, the other day. He came in, I paid him, and he left. That's pretty much it. [Officer Betts] After that, any idea where he could've gone? Oh, well, maybe a casino? He's got a pretty bad gambling addiction. [Betty] You know, I thought I saw his truck here. [Chuckling] A black one, might've been silver, but I don't remember. I wear glasses, my memory's shot. Anyway, you know, I was just explaining to him that Zach is one of your male callers. She has a lot of men that come and visit... [Ava] Thank you so much, Betty. Officer, I would... I would actually be okay if you wanted to go in and look around. [Betty] With a warrant! [Ava] No! No, Betty, he doesn't need a warrant. - Need a warrant. - No, we don't. - No? - You know what? Come on in. Thank you so much for your help, Betty. I watch enough TV shows to know you need a warrant! - Have a great day. - Yes. - Thank you, Ms. Wilcox. - Officer Betts. - We'll see you later. - Okay, well, neighborhood watch. - Goodbye! - Nice to see you! Thank you for your service! Nice man. Nice young man. Liked him. [Officer Betts] Guess you really are an interior decorator. [Ava] Yes, I really am. [Officer Betts chuckles] [Mellow music] Oh, that's Anubis. It's imported from Egypt. Anubis is a dog. This is Ra. King of all gods. [Tense music] Only he... knew his hidden name. Born every morning in the east... Died every night in the west, then he ventured into the underworld. You know, west of the Nile is actually known as the land of the dead? - Is this the way to the garage? - Yes, it is. Oh, I know, the smell is just... It's terrible, isn't it? I had a rat problem a couple weeks ago. They get trapped in the walls and die there. Yeah, I stepped on a dead one the other day, almost slipped and killed myself. Well, look, my brother-in-law is an exterminator. I'm sure he could take care of your problem for you. [Ava] Oh, I would appreciate that. I've done everything short of burning the house down. [Officer Betts] Well, don't do that. I'm gonna give you his number instead, okay? [Ava] Gosh, you're a life-saver. [Officer Betts] Because this stuff... Doesn't really work. [Laughing] Hey, I used to have this same blanket as a kid. You mind? Oh, be my guest. [Tense music] [Latch opening] I've been meaning to get rid of this box. Just got in a big shipment of vases. [Officer Betts] Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you. - I'll see myself out. - Oh, allow me. [Miranda] Jim, you're making me feel like I don't exist! [Jim] Oh, did I exist when you were screwing Derek? [Miranda] I don't know any Derek! [Jim] Oh, then how'd he know about our private stuff? I don't know! That's what I've been trying to tell you. Look, I don't want to fight anymore. - Me neither. - Okay, no, no, no. I think it's time that we should see a lawyer. [Somber music] Oh, where's... Where's your ring? I'm seeing someone. What? - But I love... I love... - I'm sorry, Miranda, it's over. Jim, please don't do this! What about Chelsea? [Engine starting] [Somber music] [Car driving away] [Ava's mother] What a mess. [Groaning] Jim's gonna find out what a messy girl you are. [Spraying] And he's not gonna want a messy girl. Clean this up. [Ava panting] [Groaning] [Grunting] Don't forget, you have a roof over your head and a mommy who loves you, and that is all you need. [Sniffling] [Breathing heavily] [Darlene] You need to try reverse phone lookup. What was that number? Okay. [Sighs] 818-555-4556. Reverse phone lookup, work your magic. Zach Tully. Okay. Painter... Carpenter... Contractor. Interior... Decorator. [Mellow music] [Jim] How was design class today? [Chelsea] Great! Wow! Looks like we're gonna have to get you a new office too. - Jeez. - I have big ideas, and big ideas need big spaces, dad. - I'm proud of you, Chelsea. - Thanks. So, uh... Listen, um... I wanna... I wanna be upfront and honest with you here. - Sure, dad. - Um... I started seeing someone. [Chelsea] I get that mom hurt you, but how could you just start dating... In a way, your mom and I have been apart for years. It's been hard, it's been really hard for me without her. Like it hasn't been for me? So, what? Throw mom out with the trash and grab the first woman that walks by? Chelsea, no. I thought you would understand, with everything's that going on. - Would you please just sit down? - No. - Please sit down. - No. - Let's have a conversation. - You wanna divorce mom? Okay, I'll move out, live on my own, and you can start a long, happy life with someone new, because that's what you want. [Jim] Chelsea, come back here. Be an adult! Please sit down and have a conversation with me. [Playful music] [Ava] Yes, I want it to say, "happy one-month anniversary, Jim." J-i-m, all capitalized. You can do that? Oh, thank you, that's so sweet. [Laughing] And then, what would be inside of it? [Elegant music] No, no, no, no, I don't want that. No, I want the one that looks exactly like the picture. [Female singer] ♪ so sweet ♪ [Ava] It's actually, um... Mrs. Ava, and then the last name is kellens. [Woman singing] Oh, I'll make sure to be by at five to pick it up. [Music warping] Okay, it's incredibly important. [Warped singing] Great, thank you so much. [Eerie music] [Young Ava] You're never gonna leave me, and I'll never leave you. [Ominous music] [Engine starting] [Miranda] First my husband, now my name. Oh! Miranda. This is actually for you. Jim had me pick it up. Oh, really? That's funny, because Jim loves this place. He knows I'm not a fan. We're married, remember? [Dark music] [Paper rustling] "Happy one-month anniversary, Jim." One month of what? [Ava] Since we've been working together. That's funny because one month ago, Jim and I were celebrating our 20-year anniversary down in... [Ava] Oh, in Miami. Yeah, I know, he actually called me while he was with you. It's a month ago tonight that he called me and made our first appointment. He didn't give me too many details, but he did say that he desperately needed someone to fix the house. He actually said that it felt cold, vacant, and... uninviting. [Miranda laughs] [Miranda] He doesn't know how crazy you are, does he? He loves me. I know about Derek. Oh, sorry, you've probably forgotten because you've got so many lies. Uh, Zach Tully, I think his real name is. Yeah, I know everything about him. And it's probably gonna be a little hard to explain how the guy I'm supposedly having an affair with has his cell phone bill registered to your address. It's an employee phone, so, yeah, I pay for several. But what Zach does on his own time, I really can't say. I've heard that he likes older women. So... only you'd be able to help me there. [Miranda] Oh, that was so convincing! But you know, I have this friend, Darlene. Oh, yeah, you met her, I think. She's recently introduced me to the world of cyberstalking, miss Ava andor. Or wait, um, Ava Driscoll, right? Oh, no, no, wait, um, Mrs. Zach Tully. While your marriage to Zach was a mere, what, 16-hour ordeal, I guess, um, what happened in Las Vegas didn't really stay in Las Vegas, now did it? Let me explain. [Miranda] Decorate yourself out of this one, Ava. I'll take that. [Ava's mother] He loves his wife, not you. You can explain everything to him. [Ava's mother] You're such a mess. [Intense music] [Ava grunts] [Young Ava] It's okay, it's okay. [Grim music] [Birds chirping] [Woman] That patient's in the ICU. I'll transfer you to nurses' station now. - Can you hold? - Yes, I'll hold. [Light hold music, dark background music] [Young Ava] I'll make it so beautiful. Like you've never seen it before. - ICU nurses' station. - Hi, I'm actually calling about a patient. - Patient name? - Her name is Miranda kellens. - I'm her daughter, Chelsea. - Your dad's here. - She's been prepped for surgery. - Oh, she is? [Man] I think you should get here right away. Oh my gosh, um... Okay, yes, yes, I'll, um... I'll be there as soon as I can. Thank you so much. [Bright music] [Dr. Fredrick] Mr. Kellens? I'm Dr. Fredrick. The ct scans have revealed that your wife has a skull fracture. As a result of the trauma that she has suffered, she's developed a subdural hematoma. Hema... hematoma? What's that? [Dr. Fredrick] The tissue between the brain and the skull has developed tearing, which has caused a significant amount of blood putting pressure around the brain, so we need to take her to surgery right away. If we don't relieve this pressure, it can lead to brain death. So I need you to sign this surgery consent form. [Somber music] Because we don't know how long your wife laid there after her fall, only time will be able to tell us if she'll be able to make a full neurological recovery. Do you understand what I mean, Mr. Kellens? We won't know if she'll become responsive. - Mr. Kellens? - Responsive? What does responsive mean? If she'll survive. There is a family waiting room down the hall. Dad! Oh, what's going on? [Jim] Your mom fell. She hit her head. This is my fault. - No, no. - We have to go, - let them do their job. - Dad, no! We have to go down to the waiting room. - Dad! - Come on. - Come on, honey. - No. [Gentle piano music] [Chelsea] I know you told me to throw myself into my work, but... I don't know if I'm really helping you out or not with all that's going on. Look, I know it can be kinda confusing. What if mom never fully recovers? [Ava] Hey, worst case scenario. I'm gonna be here for you, okay? You've been so amazing through all of this, but... you're just not my mother. [Tense music] Well, one day, when your father and I get married, it'll be... What did you say? Oh, I just mean that time has a way of healing everything. That's not what you said. So it's you he's seeing? Chelsea, please don't take this the wrong way. [Chelsea] My mother is fighting for her life, and you're thinking about marrying my dad? [Scoffs] Chelsea! [Dramatic music] He will always love my mother. He will never marry you, never! [Ethereal music] [Jim] Forgive me, sweetie, but I'm gonna go home and get some rest. Please don't leave me. [Machines beeping, whirring] See you tomorrow, okay? [Ominous music] [Ava] Ah, Miranda. Guess what? Jim is gonna propose to me now. And I just want you to know that he is a fantastic lover. He's the best I've ever had, actually. You know, I think we'll have maybe a beach wedding. [Coughing] Shh. What do you think? I think that'll be nice. And hopefully, he'll want kids. 'Cause I might already be pregnant. Shh. It's okay. There you go. [Intense music] You miss so much by being on the road. But hey, your loss is my gain. [Machines puffing] [Machine beeping] [Flatlining] [Phone ringing] [Footsteps approaching] [Jim] Sorry, nurse, I forgot my... [dramatic music] - Ava? - Jim, you're here. You're not happy with her, you're happy with me. What are you... [grunts] Help! [Somber music] Help! [Flatlining] [Dr. Fredrick] Mr. Kellens, I'm gonna need you to wait outside. - Help. - I'm gonna need you - to wait outside, Mr. Kellens. - Okay, okay. Code blue! [Dramatic somber music] Calling code blue! [Muffled shouting] [Machine beeping] V-fib! Push 25. [Beeping] [Charging] Wait. Clear. [Echoing thud] [Unintelligible] [Beeping] [Sniffling] [Muffled speaking] Two amps of epinephrine. [Charging] Clear. [Echoing thud] Come on, we're losing her! [Somber music] [Betty] "Dear Betty, I had to leave suddenly. Here's another copy of my house key. Don't lose it, but if you do, the code is 1-4-3." [Knocking] - Police, open up. - "That means 'I love you.'" [sobbing] [Officer Betts] Ava andor! It's the police, open up! [Ava and Betty] "As far as my stuff goes, keep it, donate it, recycle it. None of it matters." [Somber music] [Betty sobbing] "Love, Ava. P.S. You were the only one who was ever there for me. I will never forget that." [Sobbing] Be safe, sweet girl. [Birds chirping] [Car rumbling] [Melancholy music] [Footsteps approaching] How was she? Touch and go. Dad... The main thing we have to do right now is have full faith that mom will pull through this. Absolutely. Police called. They said Ava drained her bank accounts, and their best guess is she left the state. Of course she did. But, dad, they're gonna find her. She'll go to jail where she belongs. I know this is the last thing you want to hear, and... I know we can't really afford it right now, but... we should completely redo the house. I'll do it myself, and it'll be a million times better. Now it's just that, if mom comes home... When mom comes home, I don't want there to be anything here that could remind her of... I have to go back to work. Gotta prep some notes on a manuscript I forgot. Dad, you're tired. [He sighs] I'm waiting on a new book tomorrow, and I have to be prepared. Dad, please. [Melancholy music] - It's okay. - Stay for a bit. [Jim] I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? Hey, love you. [Sobbing] [Eerie music] [Ava's mother] You're a monster. Chelsea can redecorate that place a million times better than you. I don't think so. [Ava's mother] When she was in need, Miranda left and you went and decorated his office, and what appreciation did he show you? How are you going to clean up this mess? You messy girl. [Dark music] [Traffic humming] [Lock clicking] [Clattering] [Dramatic music] [Groans] [Groans] [Pouring] [Coffee pot clacking] [Sighs] [Groans] [Music intensifying] Jim? I have something really, really special planned for you tonight. I think you're gonna enjoy it. [Creepy, ominous music] [Deep breath] I've been waiting for this for a long time, Jim. Wake up! [Soft music] Isn't that what you said, Chelsea? Didn't you say that you were a million times better than me? So let's see it, right? Let's see it, Chelsea. Come here. Come here, Chelsea. [Jim groaning] [Breathing heavily] Come on, Jim. I hope you're comfortable. Look, it's our daughter! It's Chelsea. [Intense music] What do you think? [Muffled scream] Hi, honey. How ya doin'? You know, you were such a disappointment, Chelsea. I had such high hopes for you. [Muffled scream] [Muffled scream] She's doing great. Come here. [Groaning] Look, Chelsea, look! Daddy's watching you. Yeah. [Groaning] How are you, honey? [Groaning] Wait, one more time, Chelsea, say that again. [Groaning] What? Speak up, Chelsea, I can't hear you. [Intense music] Look, look at daddy! [Screaming] Look, do you see daddy? Daddy, do you see Chelsea? What do you think? She's not doing great, Jim. Look what a mess you've made, Chelsea. Look at it. Look at, look at this. It's all messy! There's such a mess! Hey, Chels. Oh, honey. You got a bump. [Ethereal music] Oh, and guess what, Jim? You've got a bomb attached to you, so if Chelsea doesn't do what I say, you're gonna blow up! [Intense music] Made you look, didn't I? Why wouldn't you love me, Jim? [Sighs] [Jim] Hey, hey! Hey, man, I need your phone. - Use your own damn phone. - My daughter's been kidnapped, I need to call the police. Look, buddy, I'm not gonna give you my phone. [Engine starting] Someone's going crazy. What are you doing? Dude! [Groaning] [Jim] I'll give this back as soon as possible. [Engine revving] [Man] Hey, dude, can I borrow your phone? - I just got carjacked! - No, get your own damn phone! - It's broken? - What? - Come on, just gimme your phone. - No! [Ava] I'm sorry, baby. Aw, did mommy hurt you? [Young Ava] You're gonna live in an amazing, beautiful house. [Ava] I made everything so perfect, Chelsea. You messed it up, Jim, you messed it up! How are we gonna fix this, Chels? You're gonna make some pillowcases for mommy, okay? [Young Ava] I'll make it so beautiful. [Ava] Look, look, we have fabric and colors. [Young Ava] Like you've never seen it before. [Engine revving] [Dramatic music] [Tires screeching] [Ava] Just because I'm such a monster, Chelsea, isn't that what you said? Didn't you say that I'm a monster? [Young Ava] There's gonna be so many cool things... [Laughing] [Ava] Speak up, Chelsea, I can't hear you! [Young Ava] You're never gonna leave... [Ava] You ready to play, Chelsea? Come on, it's time to wake up. Get up, Chelsea! [Young Ava] And I'll never leave you. [Ava] Come here, hon. [Mellow music] Hey, Chels, wake up. Chelsea? Wake up. Wake up! Come on, go! Move! [Ava] You're gonna make a pillowcase for your mommy. There's one perfectly matched combination, and if you figure it out, I'll let you live. What do you think? Do you like this one, do you like this one, do you like this one? Come on, Chelsea! Oh, this one? [Dark music] That's the wrong choice, Chelsea. Pick another one. This one? Ah, mommy likes this one too. Okay, now you have to cut it. Cut the fabric, Chelsea, come on! Okay, mommy's gonna help you then. Where are my scissors? Where are my scissors? Where... where are my scissors? Where are my scissors? Where are my scissors?! [Dramatic music] [Panting] So, mommy couldn't find the scissors because you've been too messy, so we're gonna use this. [Grim music] Okay, baby, you like this one? Oh, perfect! All right. [Fabric tearing] Yes! What do you think? [Eerie music] Look what you're making me do, Jim. Look what you're making me do to our daughter. Oh, honey. [Ava chuckles] Why don't you come over, Jim? Why don't you come here... And help your daughter? Why don't you help Chelsea? I think she's in pain. [Engine revving] [Panting, snipping] Look what you've done, Jim. This is all your fault. [Intense music] What are you doing? Chelsea, where are you going? I thought... I thought we were friends. [Chelsea] Ava, we are friends, but... why did you do this? Why did you hurt my family? Why did you hurt my mom? [Ava's mother] Can I see the doll, Ava? Don't talk about my mother. [Chelsea panting] You don't know anything about my mother. Stop. I was never gonna let you live, Chelsea. - Stop! - Give me the doll! - Give it to me! - You're gonna die. - Stop, no! - Jim, your daughter's gonna die. - Stop! - And you're gonna watch. [Ava's mother] You have a roof over your head and a mommy who loves you. [Chelsea] No, don't, stop! Daddy, I love you! No, don't! [Intense music] [Grunts, thud] [Dark music] Dad! Remember, always use an accent piece. - You okay? - Yeah. [Jim] Come on, up, up, up, come on. Here we go, come on. [Eerie music] [Mellow music] [Machines beeping, whirring] Miranda? Miranda? [Breathing] Squeeze again if you can hear me. [Chelsea] Dr. Fredrick! She's responsive! She's squeezing my hand. [Chelsea] Mom, squeeze my hand if you can hear me. [Uplifting music] [Laughing] She is! She is responsive. I love you. [Dr. Fredrick] Congratulations. You just got your mom back. [Chelsea] Thank you. [Sniffles] [Woman] Oh, I've been looking, looking, looking, looking. I know I can find it, I know it's somewhere, it's somewhere. Where's my pillow? I've been looking all over for it. - We'll look for it. - All over for it. [Woman] I can't sleep without it! Hey there, Ava. How we doin' today? Okay? [Dark music] Right, we got a guest here to visit you. Is that all right? Yeah? Okay, here, come on. [Woman] I don't know what to do. [Man] Hey, Harvey? [Woman] I need my pillow. [Man] I need your help. [Betty] Hi, honey. [Woman] Help me, I need my pillow! How ya doin' today? [Dark music] [Betty sniffles] [Grim music] I thought you might like to keep her. [Eerie music] My doll. Now, uh... A little neighborhood gossip. I know you love gossip. Remember that crazy couple... [Ava's mother] Where'd you get the doll, Ava? [Young Ava] Neighbor Betty gave it to me for my birthday. [Betty] He got out one night... [Ava's mother] Betty gave it to you for your birthday? [Ethereal music] [Betty] Literally terrorized the neighborhood. Mommy's here. I'm always gonna love you. I love you. [Betty] I don't know what these people are doing... Mommy loves you. [Betty gossiping] [Sniffles] You're gonna be okay. [Betty] They got out again... I love you. [Young Ava] You're never gonna leave me, and I'll never leave you. [Betty] I'm still looking for my kitty. I didn't want her getting anywhere near the Danes. [Ethereal music] When kitty comes back, you'll be the first one I'll tell. I know how much you... You loved her too. [Villainous music] Ava? Ava? Oh, stay with me. I'm right here. [Dark music]
