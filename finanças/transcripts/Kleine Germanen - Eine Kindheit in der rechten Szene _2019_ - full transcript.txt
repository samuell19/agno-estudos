As children we had to be strong. We weren't allowed to cry or become attached to anything Discipline was the most important thing. Each one of us experienced it in their own way. Everything starts with our upbringing. I grew up in a normal family. Like many others. Sheltered and secure. I was given a name I loved. Elsa. Darling, did you see my briefcase? Isn't it in the bedroom? No, it's not there. But I had to change my name often since then. I haven't touched it. Papa! I drew that for you. Thank you. No one must know my current name. Damn! I told you... There it is. Be a good girl. When will you be back? I don't know. Bye. Will you draw a picture for me too? I have to go to work. Goodbye. Hello, sweetie. Grandpa, there you are! My little Elsa. Did you miss me? - Yes, a lot! - Yes. - Stoj! Ruki werch! - Ouch! Come out. Hands up! Sastrelju Njemka! You're dead, Boloshik! Bang! Bang! It's called Bolshevik. You've defeated me. That was great. I'm proud of you. The enemy was devious, but you were smarter. Attention, private Elsa! For this brave deed facing the Asian hordes I give to you the honour badge of the SS Home Guard Danzig. What is the slogan, Private Elsa? - For our Führer, our Nation, our Fatherland. - Yes. My grandpa was my one and only. I loved him and his stories of the Third Reich. We are the people! We are the people! We are the people! We are the people! Right-wing extremism is a social movement that includes different interests and different organisations. At the fringe there's right-wing populism. Extreme right-wing opinions are seen as the truth. And if I say my opinion is true, I have to consider all other opinions as false. It's a clear position, also about family and parenting. It's all about showing no weakness. The children must represent the same ideology. That's difficult in an open, democratic society. Today in Vienna we've bled, sweated and fought together. Europe- Youth -Reconquista! Europe- Youth -Reconquista! My grandmother was an avowed National Socialist. She endorsed Hitler, except his insanity at the end when he started the war of extermination and destroyed himself. My name is Alexander Lingner. Until I was 19 I only knew two places. Vienna and Traunkirchen in the Salzkammergut. My grandmother lived there. I always went there for summer vacation. My grandfather was in the German Wehrmacht. I know one picture of him in a German Wehrmacht uniform. It was displayed nicely in the cabinet. You saw him smiling at you when you entered the room. Everyone was proud that he fought for the Greater German Reich. Look at those mountains, Elsa. This is our Germany. The most beautiful country in the world. Can we take a break, grandpa? No. Why? We're almost at the cabin. We'll finish the trail without a break. Only cowards quit. It hurts so much. A German soldier knows no pain. Here, this is for you. Be proud of your wounds. Look, it was worth it. You know, we must protect our beautiful homeland. Land of dark forests, And of crystal clear lakes. Over wide-open fields, light miracles shimmer. Forceful peasants march, behind horse and plow. Conservative revolutionary is exactly the right expression. We are both not interested in change. We're both retro types. My name is Götz Kubitschek. I was born 1970 in Upper Swabia. Ravensburg, Weingarten. I grew up and went to the military there. My name is Ellen Kositza. I was born in Offenbach am Main. My parents came from East Germany. They are "Silesian". My own childhood makes me nostalgic when I think about it. We could play freely. We were outside a lot and among other children. I have nice memories of that. If someone would ask me why I have so many children, which is anachronistic today, I always come back to that I loved being a child I have sunny memories of my childhood. You always tell your parents when you go to the forest, to the soccer field or the swimming pool or play with your comrades in your room. It was a very protected childhood and youth. It was all embedded in Christian faith. That's a keyword. You can apply it to both of our childhoods. Our childhood was framed. It was clear that there was no other way than the way of the church, with communion, confirmation and so on. Now, everything is optional. You have the youth initiation, but also protestant and catholic families. It's not culturally defining anymore. - It's rather... - It's fragmented. You find a sort of niche group. That wasn't the case in many aspects of our childhood. I think that's one of the biggest generational differences to what our children are experiencing now. We are the people! We are the people! We are the people! On the horizon a new opportunity has risen. A political dawn. And it's a lust to be furious and to show your teeth to politics. The others are always the evil ones. We learn and internalise that. It's the first feeling, the highest command. What are you doing? What did we talk about last time? That I mustn't watch American things on TV. And why not? Because it's enemy propaganda. Yes! And why is that so? Because they want to enslave us. Exactly. And why do you still watch those movies? Because they are colourful and funny. I am sorry. Yes. I was trained by my grandpa like a dog. I was forced to hate everything alien. And learn the book "Mein Kampf" by heart. I was really scared of those Jews, although I had never seen one before. A mother and her little son go for a walk in the park. The son sees a rat and wants to pet it. But the mother explains to him that there are harmful and useful animals. "You know Gunther, in wildlife it's like with us humans. There are proud, noble animals like eagles, and there's scabby vermin like rats. The former, you must respect. The latter, you must beware. Because they corrode our nice country." Gunther understands and nods. "And do you know what those human rats are called?" the mother continues. "Of course I know them, mother. They are the Jews." My fears even followed me into my dreams. There are young women who were traditionally raised in National Socialist families. Their grandparents were National Socialists. Their parents carried it on. And the daughters did the same thing. The interesting thing is that they related strongly to the male line, but the line of tradition is passed on by the women. Daughter and mother usually build a unity in which that sort of thinking is possible. On the other hand the right-wing ideology was conveyed by the grandfathers, combined with a very close mental and physical bond. Ideology was linked with emotions. And the girls were trapped in that. "You know why history is so important." And the students had to answer. "Yes, yes, because of our past." My name is Sigrid Schüssler. I'm the mother of four children. That's my main occupation. I take it very seriously. Accompanying children in a positive way nowadays so they can master their own lives. Furthermore, I sometimes appear at public events of PEGIDA and similar occasions. What else do I do? I stand trial. Because of my speeches. I am accused of incitement of the masses. Listen to what we have to say! Don't listen to the fake-news press! Turn off your damn TVs! Think for yourselves! Open your eyes! Look at what happens! How they lie to your kids in school! How they get destroyed by a disgusting, unnatural early sexualisation! How the homo cult in this country is embraced! Bravo. How families get destroyed! We played a lot as kids. And our parents were there for us when we needed them. The stress that's present everywhere nowadays... You throw your kids in the car to take them from A to B, mothers have to arrange meetings between kids... We didn't have that back then. There were always children around. That's what counted. I don't feel that I was shaped. I feel that I was given offers. By my father. To look at backgrounds. To consider other opinions. To maybe think two or three steps ahead and not just stay on the surface. Of course I became rebellious in school. I was ready for anything at 13. Ready to take on the world. I wanted to make Germany great again. And I wasn't alone with my dream. Others had gone a lot further than me. They had already formed a militant party. That's where I met Thorsten. He fascinated me. He was radical, A tough guy... A true man. This Jew-Republic only cares about refugees and foreigners! Not about the Germans! I say: Every Turk, every nigger, every chink is one too many. Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! At some point I even turned against my favourite teacher. As soon as I heard that she was a Jew she was scum to me. Elsa! That caused a lot of trouble. My mother and my grandfather were called to see the principal. But if she gets expelled, what are we supposed to do? Mr. Principal, we have nothing against Jews. I don't know where that comes from. It must be her new friends. Didn't you notice the Nazi tattoo on her arm? Oh god! We can remove that. Grandpa wanted us to stay quiet. I couldn't cope with that. That was just cowardly. Traitor! I didn't get along with my classmates. Later a girl told me: You always said such weird things. I talked a lot about the allied occupation. And that we were not a sovereign state. I brought up topics. And the teachers... actually it was just one female teacher, a history teacher, she couldn't handle my questions. The preconceived opinions you're presented with, I questioned them. I believe that I developed defiance. I questioned all the things. "you mustn't think or talk or read about." That was one factor for me in finding my way to the political right. We had those first young '68 teachers who came to teach us. Who wanted to be addressed informally with "du". That was a shock for the school. And I had a weirdly close relationship with the old teachers who realised how things would develop if those things became established. I also stuck to the older ones. To those who were strict and less popular. You can't call it a conviction. - It's a basic impulse. - Right. A lot of what we do isn't explainable. There's no need to rationalise our concept of life. There's a lot of character formation involved. To be like that has something irrational to it. In Baden there are the castle ruins of Raueneck. Allegedly it was built by a crusader after having returned from the Holy Land. We used to go there in the summer to let paper planes fly. In the winter to sled. I'd also go there later in my political life. It was a part of home for me. And also a part of tradition, connection and heritage. From there our ancestors could see the dust clouds of the approaching Ottoman Army. It was repeatedly the last bastion for Vienna and the last line of defence for Europe. That's something I've been proud of. That we have a history of defending. And that without those Viennese, our ancestors, Europe wouldn't exist in today's form. My name is Martin Sellner. I am 28 years old. I am a Viennese. Student, activist of the Identitarian movement. Welcome with me the leader of the Identitarian movement Martin Sellner. In Austria, in a few month, if everything works out, we'll have the most conservative government ever. The reign of Red and Black is broken. 60% of the population have voted for a conservative, patriotic change. That's great! A window to the future of Germany! What we can do, and each and everyone of you can help, is changing the mainstream the opportunists will be guided by tomorrow. That's our key to victory. We're many steps ahead. The election in Austria shows what's possible in Germany. The weird or bad thing about Offenbach, the foreigner hordes who hit on you, touched or even assaulted you, was that I realised very late that it was foreigners. To me, they were just proles. At some point you realise that those who call after you and harass you in the city, that those proles are never Germans. I knew that my children... I had my first three children in Offenbach... that they shouldn't live in Offenbach anymore when they go to school. It was clear that we move to Eastern Germany. When I was about twelve years old, the feeling was really strong in me. I grew up with a certain fear especially of Turks, back then. They were running us down. It's really bad that they run us down. All of our Austrian values get lost. It's terrible for people who live among Turks. They're like foreigners in their own country. That has to stop. Every day a good deed for our homeland. That was our motto. Look at those damn wogs. The police cared little back then. What do you damn foreigners want here? - Ne var! - I don't speak that! - Kimse yardim etmiyormu? - Don't touch me, camel jockey! Damn wog, I'll teach you! Help! Polisi carin... Shut up! Get out of Germany! You have no business here! And take your little freak with you. The cops, come on! At the age of 18, I married Thorsten. Our highest priority was to have many children for the movement and our fatherland. Congratulations. You have a healthy daughter. And what should we call her? Marrit! Her name will be Marrit. With Odin and Thor as leaders the noble Germanic troops march towards the enemy. Thor rides on a golden carriage glowing in the sun. He holds his hammer Mjolnir tight in his fist. The cruel weapon that was forged for him by the dwarfs. Opposed to the gods in this dark heavenly valley stands the Army of the demons led by the devious Loki. Behind them follows the huge Midgard snake. It spoils the earth by spraying its poison everywhere. Thor challenges the Midgard snake to a fight. Thor killed the evil Midgard snake. He sacrificed himself. And thus saved the Germanic people. Marrit, do you know what that story means? It means we have to fight until death. The fight for our homeland is our holy duty. Why? So we don't get enslaved. Germanic people must never be slaves of foreign people. Do you understand? When you're grown up, you'll also fight for our homeland. Swift as greyhounds, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp-Steel... That's how we we're supposed to be. Children are taught that we're always on the brink of a catastrophe. This "us" is linked with fear. The fear that at at any time, at a moment's notice you could leave everything behind. They are taught not to commit to their environment and their life situation. That's another reality of those children. I've witnessed a lot of parenting. They're talked into thinking that war can be here anytime, the cities will burn, and we have to escape immediately. This awareness is being conveyed to the children every day. I've seen people spend the last few cents on eye drops and bandages to prepare a suitcase, in case the war starts tonight. So that they could leave right away. This feeling is being conveyed to the kids daily. You could be pulled out of bed and have to leave, because Germany is falling apart. I'm Ricarda Riefling, 33 years old. Mother of four children. I'm self-employed, but mainly a mother and housewife. I only have brothers. Probably I became Daddy's princess automatically. I was Daddy's girl. It was important to my parents that I follow certain rules. I did that, and they gave me the freedom to develop in my own direction. Behind us lies a field where many decades ago terrible things happened. Every year the farmer ploughs out the tags and bones of the soldiers who still lie there. On such a field the state where we have to live has established itself. It's not our state. A system that builds on such a ground has to be fought. And we need to use days like this to set a clear example. A state which can't or doesn't want to remember its own dead, is not what we want. We oppose it. I had a nice and child-oriented childhood. I only have positive memories. I could tell stories for hours about what we did. Stayed up all night because a calf was born on the neighbour's farm. I went there every day before school to check in on it. I could persuade the farmer to let me feed it. I did it before and after school. Those were the things I cared about then. We became more and more aggressive. One asylum shelter after another was set on fire. Our party was banned. But that wasn't the end for us. Wow! Marrit. That's a big bull-calf. There's often a struggle. Come here. Look, this goes here, you see? And the rope goes around the hoofs. Like this. And now... Careful. Nudge it with your hand. Like this? Yes, exactly. Slippery! Hey, not too much. The calf has to fight, or it won't be a strong bull. It's like with us humans. I see. Come on. - Come. - Together. Come on. Yes. It's done. Soon we'll have enough animals to survive any war. When a child is raised on an agricultural farm, they'll watch the reproduction of the animals. Then they'll talk about what it would be like if the Germanic people would have recultivated. According to which attributes people would be categorized and would choose partners. You live in a social Darwinist breeding idea that seems natural to the children. Just as horses, dogs, cats, so the human being. And from this idea, the whole worldview is established. From that biological context it's assumed that culture is the consequence of the biological. The genetics of the individual and the group determine the cultural performance. That's the essential assumption of this worldview. We needed a safe environment for our children. That's why we moved from the city to the country. We found a new refuge among sympathisers. A community where we could live like our ancestors. We both chose to say farewell to our old home for a new region, a new home. The precious things are the same as they used to be. The feeling of what home really is. The feeling of being at home. On the other hand, we live in a time when a lot of what was good has been destroyed. It has to be rebuilt. It can't be rebuilt to be like it had been 40 or 50 years ago in parenting. It has to be adapted to the situation. But it has to be done in order to preserve it. That of course is an incredible effort in the parenting of one's own children. Comrades. I ask two of our fellow strugglers onstage who made outstanding contributions to our movement and our conviction. It's time to welcome them as full members of our community. Elsa and Thorsten! Dear Elsa. Dear Thorsten. We are people of Nordic heritage. Our nature reflects the godlike and the inevitable laws of nature. Do you swear to a life in accordance with the laws of nature? We swear. Humanity consists of different races who are in conflict with each other. Do you swear to the preservation and support of our own race as your highest goal in life? We swear! Humanity is immortal in its offspring who carries its heritage. This heritage must not be polluted with foreign elements. Do you swear to pass on our life in a pure way? Yes, we swear. There are different persons and organisations who operate in the field of right-wing radicals and extremists. That's long-term experience. We have small numbers who show themselves when they drop out. They grew up in extremist families. Their parents, grandparents, siblings, uncles, aunts are in nationalist groups. They see themselves as representatives of a superior race. Children stand out through rejection of certain toys. The childlike explanation they give in the kindergarten suggests some form of indoctrination. The classic is the black doll they don't want to play with. Some extreme examples can be summarised under childish inurement, obviously demanded by the parents. Too thin clothes in winter. Freezing children. Children who don't get proper nutrition, not because they're from a poor family but because it's part of the inurement to do without food for a while. Our children were only allowed to play with kids from our community. The girls must only wear skirts. We would have prefered to have our own schools and preschools, where the children are taught absolute discipline. But we had no money for that. Marrit is very good at drawing. Yes, she's very talented. She truly is. But we've also noticed that she is very reserved. She barely plays with the other children. And we're worried about something else. She's drawing things like this, a swastika. - Who could have shown her that? - I don't know. No idea. You know... usually we report things like that to the child protective services. Maybe it's from the Germanic sagas book I read to her. It has lots of old pictures. Well... It's a Germanic rune, isn't it? Now I got you! Look, Mama. Odin created men and women out of ash and elm, both were made out of wood. Equal but different. And in Christianity, Eve was cut out of the expendable rib of Adam. While in Germanic culture women and men were equal. this isn't the case in Christianity. Christianity is also a desert religion that was forcefully established in Germany. And I think history could repeat itself. I think about the crusades here, the forced Christianisation. Who knows if there won't be a forced Islamisation at some point. OUR COUNTRY NEEDS GERMAN CHILDREN WE DON'T WANT TO DIE (OUT) NATURALLY GERMAN OUR HOMELAND NEEDS CHILDREN NO HOMO MARRIAGE NEW GERMANS? WE MAKE THEM OURSELVES Christianity has the flaw that if you get hit in the face, you should turn the other cheek. Germans fight back instead. Mama, I don't understand. Why mustn't I draw that? It's the sign of Thor. You can draw that at home, but not in the nursery. Otherwise the police will take you and lock you away. The people in the nursery don't like us. Because we're much better and smarter. Do you understand? Then Thor has to defeat them. Yes, but until then you mustn't tell anyone about what we do at home. Also not that we visit the comrades on the weekend. Do you understand? Yes, Mama. It's not easy for children to go to school during the day and have lessons about history or natural science and then come back home, that is structured by nationalistic principles. Where they experience a completely different way of thinking. They have to work a lot, with animals, with dogs. And all that is garnished and seasoned with an accompanying ideology. Then Hermann was born with a disability. That changed our whole life. Come up. To the comrades, he was a freak. An unnecessary eater. Even to his father. This is your brother Hermann. You can hold him if you like. Here, take him. You're already a great big sister. Hello, my little brother. But Marrit loved her little brother from the beginning. My father was always ahead of the crowd. I can't remember chronologically because I was just a child. But I remember seeing my father on TV on the evening news. He appeared in court in Berlin, but I can't remember why. He was acquitted. Probably it was about incitement of the masses, because he had publicly expressed his opinions... that didn't suit the system. My father was someone... ...you would want to click your heels when he entered the room. like in the old times. My mother had to work, she wasn't around during the day. My father was everywhere. He was always there in my life, except when I was at school. To my father, my grades were really important. He made sure I'd get extra lessons when I weakened in school. He cared about walking upright. He didn't want any slouching. Most important to him was that I never answered back. My father always said that we'd be rewarded for good work and when we accomplished something. Usually we didn't get any pocket money. We only got money for good grades or other achievements. His usual quotes were: "You must work!" "You never give up." Per aspera ad astra". "Through hardship to the stars". In general, you have to achieve something, you have to get up, you can't lie in bed all day. Get your business done, get good grades. That was important to our parents. I'm proud of our culture. I'm proud of our buildings, the cafés. I'm proud of what my father does. I'm proud of what my children will do one day. I'm proud of what our ancestors have built up. People like Mozart are our direct ancestors. They belong to the world, but especially to us. We are more intelligent. Better by birth. Anyone who looks different is not one of us. We are the elite. The Germanic race has fair skin. The snow white arms of Germanic women are praised in poems. What sticks out is the rosiness of the skin and the visible blood in blue veins. This is the origin of the term "blue blooded". My friends! We mustn't allow that those... - Come! - I want to daddy! holiest traits of the Germanic race... - No! - Come on! ...are polluted by the blood of a different - ...human race... - Hush, quiet! and our race is destroyed forever. Right! That's how it is. Very nice, congratulations. Being "German" is an identity that has developed in a specific area at a specific time within a specific people. It has shaped this country in every aspect, every area of life. And has made it distinctive. Over the centuries, it has developed distinctly to everything that surrounds it. To become an exceptional expression in this world. Imagine going to South-west Germany and not getting stuffed pig's stomach anymore, because pork discriminates people. For hundreds of years, people here have been eating pork. The Bavarians eat pork hock. But to prevent any upset, it can't be served anymore. Pork is culture and identity. It can't be taken off the menu only to please other people. Should our people preserve its continuity? Should it continue? As a unique culture. Or is it over with that? We're on the side of those who say: This people has to maintain its uniqueness - No, leave me! - Stop crying, mongo. - Makes you look even uglier. - You freak. Mama! You will eat this now! That's vermin like you. Look at that! It's disgusting! Leave my brother alone! - Stop it! - You stupid pig! Stop it, stupid witch! What's going on here? - Stop that! Enough! - Don't touch my brother again, pig! You listen?! Thorsten, we need to talk. We need to find a solution for this. It can't go on like this. Your son is not normal. You have to realize that. Why don't you put him in a home? Are you crazy? What are you talking about?! Hermann is still my child. Elsa, calm down! Gregor just wants to help. I'll explain it to you. Now that Thorsten will soon be my deputy he has to be a role model for everyone. An authority. How can he be with a son like that? Hermann is strong like anyone else. You don't understand. Children with his disability can be just as smart and brave as others. That's scientifically proven. They just need more time to learn. Oh yes? And what do you have to say? Well, I can't help you then. The holiday camps to which we sent our kids are inconspicuous. But fun and games look very different there. Count off! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! It's your fault if he messes up again. Understood? Let's happily march on through the world with firm steps. Too slow! Homeland, fatherland! What's going on back there?! Keep up! Come on, go! Hello?! Oh great. You're really embarrassing! It's always trouble with you. Come on, get up! Hermann. We have to move on. This isn't a game! If Dad finds out he'll smack you! I don't love you anymore! I don't love you either, idiot! - There's our lame duck. - There they are. Where were you? You go to the camp kitchen and give a hand until we're back. Understood! Understood. How long do I have to wait?! Hermann, please. Ouch! Crybaby! Crybaby! What a baby! If you take a closer look, it becomes clear that these children are being sent to right-wing extremist holiday camps. Well-known examples are the camps of Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend (HDJ) that was banned many years ago. But there are successor organisations of which regular camps have been documented. As far as I know, in the last few years camps haven't taken place in Germany anymore. We had reports from the Czech Republic and last summer from Sweden. Nationalistic camps still take place in different contexts. The HDJ isn't dead personnel-wise. It's the same networks behind them. They can change their outer shell according to their needs. That's no problem. The nationalistic groups who send their kids to the camps have a strong personal network. They communicate not only by email but often gather at calendar events like summer and winter solstice. The holiday camps for the children for defence training and personal development are just one component of the way of living in the cycle of the year. Come on, Hermann. Hello, papa. Hello, was the camp fun? - Was very cold! - Super. Hermann did a great job. Mr. Bennicksen even praised him. For his bravery. And why is he wearing a turban? It's nothing. He slipped and fell on a stone. Yes, fell. And why are you lying to me? I know exactly what happened. Hello, there you are at last. - What's wrong? - I can tell you what's wrong. Your daughter lies to my face! Unbelievable! What happened? Violence was a normal educational method for my husband. His favourite punishment was a night in the ice cold barn. But the worst punishment for our children was withdrawal of affection. That's what made them sick. Thorsten became more and more violent. Out there he battered foreigners and at home it was our turn. Then he set asylum shelters on fire again, until he was finally arrested. Papa will defeat the police. Be quiet. Papa hurt someone badly again. The directorate has decided it's best for Marrit to change schools. At a new school, no one knows her. It'll be easier for everyone. I don't want to leave. But it's not Marrit's fault! She likes going to this school. She just got an award in her music class. I'm sorry. We're a private school. Many parents have threatened to remove their children. We can't afford that. Thorsten was in prison. Now we had to get by on our own. You should think about it. If you tell us the names of accomplices you could got his sentence reduced. Useful information is paid well. I can't be bought, get lost! I see. In case you change your mind... Goodbye. Mama, the Hasslers told names too. The Hasslers are cowardly opportunists. We're not! No. I won't sell out! We won't betray the comrades. Our children are our property. We believe in our parenting. The children learn how to suffer without complaining. Being confronted with the sorrow that's been inflicted on her husband by our Zionist enemies, Elsa didn't betray us. She proved great courage and great strength. That she might unwaveringly serve the pure soil and the thriving of our race! We wish to our comrade Elsa good luck with her farm shop. Now let's celebrate! Stop that! Children being part of the ideological work or the missionary work is the norm. The child is treated like a young adult. They have to fulfil their function within the mission. Children who grow up in this context like to do it. They contribute on the frontline for what they see as a better Germany. I create space for my children, for all of them. I see their talents. And I create space for them to express themselves. But in return they have to listen when their mother speaks. That's fixed. That's what happens. Often I don't say anything. But when I do, I mean it. The way you sit, the way you eat. The way you walk. The way you approach adults. The way you greet people. Those questions are very important. In an upright and open way... Upright also in the figurative sense. Staying firm, not letting yourself be bent. An upright stance runs like a common thread through our parenting. Concerning the spine as well as the inner stance. The backbone. The shop became the centre of my life and made all of us happy. - There you go. - What's this? No idea. You handle that, I don't have the time now. Hello. Hard work and discipline. I continued to raise the kids that way. Careful, slowly. Without Thorsten. The holiday camp was out of the question. Marrit was to learn an instrument instead. Go ahead. Thank you, Mama. But I can't play the piano. I have the address of Mrs. Senftleben. She's the only piano teacher in the area. No, what are you doing, stop. Why do you play so stiffly? Why did you stop? But you said... No, continue playing. Yes, that's much better. You live up to those values. And within this framework you raise the children. The idea that a child suddenly can do something is so wrong. Nothing comes from nothing. It's all a question of discipline and commitment. On an instrument, in sports, in school. The weight that you lift, after careful thought, which a ten year old doesn't have, but a 15 or 20 year old maybe has, that's the weight you must carry. You must empty the goblet, eat up your meal. That's it, exactly. But you don't have to fill their plate and force them to eat. I think fundamental values are consequence and discipline. No matter what you do, you should do it right and to the end. Then Thorsten came back from prison. Papa is here! Hello. But it wasn't like it used to be. - Hello, Thorsten. - Hello, Elsa. Good that you're back. I sadly couldn't pick you up myself. There's so much to do in the shop. Now the family is complete again. I'm looking forward to dinner. - When do we start the next action? - What do you mean? The next action! Don't you want to rest first? I've been resting for 18 months. I want to be active again. You know the situation has changed. You should stay quiet for a while. Me? Stay quiet?! Maybe you can help your wife in the shop? She's become a real business woman. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. You could pass out flyers. There's nothing more to do. Here. We can't display those flyers here. We'll go broke if people see them and stay away. The whole day all I hear is "shop here, shop there". You should be working for the future of our homeland! Not selling rotten vegetables! And what's your business idea? Go to prison to survive?! Here it becomes clear that gender plays an important part in right-wing extremism. It stabilizes the people's community, or this imagined people's community, both inwardly and to the outside world. In this people's community, women are in a worse position than men, but worth much more than migrant men. This is the cause or one of the causes why women get active in right-wing extremism. They feel upgraded. Though they experience discrimination and disadvantage in their own group, they're involved in dominance structures and can dominate others. The division of work between the genders is formed by the image of Germanic culture. Those models of division of work are clearly presented to the children. Having many ethnically pure children is very important. This spirit is instilled in the children. What's this, damn it?! You won't leave the house like that. Wearing those Yank clothes. But Mama allowed it. For school and piano lessons. Take that off immediately! But the other girls are also allowed to. - You have... - Hey, Thorsten. Did you forget what we decided? That our daughters can wear pants to school, so they don't stand out as much. Cowards decided that! You do as I... Embarrassing children, not acknowledging them, wanting them hard as Krupp-steel, tough as leather is always linked to Nazism, right-wing extremism. But it has a much longer and deeper tradition. It has influenced much wider social circles and political milieus over a long period. Reports state that children from those families are usually very quiet and follow orders obediently. They are often exceptionally disciplined. On the schoolyard, however, in fights, kids from those nationalistic families often use the same chokeholds or fight moves. It's not like they beat up other kids systematically, but in playground brawls typical to that age you can see they've been trained and have a lot of practice. Playing the piano was the only escape for Marrit. Very nice, Marrit. Now the pianissimo, very soft, just like we practiced. Wonderful, Marrit. Wonderful. Very nice. I will talk to your parents. You have to go to a conservatory. Oh my god! - Enough! I am fed up! This degradation will stop now for good! There will be no Jewish music played in my house! There will be no more wearing jeans in my house either! And you will close your shitty store! Do I make myself clear?! Mama. Are we prisoners of our own upbringing? Who is our friend, and who is our enemy? We have it in our own hands to handle things as a family the way that we see fit. The way we are prepared, the reading we do, the reasoning we give, The width of life. The true life that we have... There are very few loopholes for our children. You'd wish for one of our children ending up with the Antifa. We both sitting here, crying, blaming one another. It's unimaginable. Not for political reasons, but because of our fundamental approach to parenting. In terms of pedagogy or psychology, our children are securely bound. In the end my children decided. Not me. I alone could never have dropped out. People who have inherited it from their families can hardly drop out. It means breaking up with their family. Especially for younger people that is very difficult or even impossible. If a child of a traditional right-wing family wants to drop out, They not only have to question the ideology they grew up with but also lose my social environment. I lose touch with relatives, with the circle of friends I grew up with. That makes it difficult to drop out. Are you sure? This won't be easy for you. We need a comprehensive statement if you want us to help you. You know what that means. I went to Canada for a semester abroad. That was the moment when I suddenly started thinking. I was surrounded by foreign students. It wasn't over after Canada. It was the seed which grew inside of me. I would definitely say that before Canada I had a racist attitude. Because I made statements like "Slavs out", "Wogs" out, "Austria is for Austrians". Get out of the way! Thorsten wasn't allowed near the house and the kids anymore. Get lost! We don't need you here! But he and his comrades didn't care at all. This is my house! For them, we were traitors who had to be eradicated. Piss off, pigs. The fear of death haunted us in our dreams. Even the police were powerless. We all slept together in one room. with knifes and axes Enough! What's going on? Be quiet. I think I heard something outside. Come with me. But be quiet. Hermann wants to come. Alright, but hurry. The house, our friends, our animals, we had to give it all up. We had to move to the city. But they still found us. Then we moved again. We even had to change our names. Because they tried to kidnap Marrit. Then we moved again. New names again. That went on for years. It was a nightmare. Our social security number gave us away. It always stayed the same despite any name changes. For Marrit, this realization came too late. Children within right-wing extremist structures are a big issue for pedagogues. But right-wing extremism takes effect much further. If it's our goal to minimize right-wing extremism and anti-democratic attitudes, it's not just about getting the children out of the right-wing extremist scene. It's difficult. What right does the government have to interfere with family structures and parenting methods? Nevertheless we must give the children another option at school. We must give them a chance to drop out. Sometimes Marrit didn't even know her name anymore. Lisa, Mona, Frida. She wanted her old name back. No one could reach her anymore. Neither me nor her brother. At some point she stopped speaking. Mama, Mama! Marrit fell through the window! I believe that racism lives off fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of leaving the privacy of your home. I stayed in that privacy for a long time and I felt safe there. But when I dared to leave I realized: Maybe I'm not as safe anymore, but I'm much happier. Does Marrit look down on us? I don't know. But I would hope so. My name was Elsa. I also often wish to have my name back. My own upbringing was still influenced by NS ideas. Nowadays it works in a more subtle way. Less obtrusive. Many of us are still trapped in this thinking without noticing it. The cage in which the children are locked in has stayed the same. The question is: How do we escape?
