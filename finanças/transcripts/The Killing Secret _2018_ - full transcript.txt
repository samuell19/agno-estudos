Can't you just stay here tonight? Now you know that if I stay it's gonna be problems. Problems that we don't need. I am so tired of this. When am I gonna have all of you and not some of you? You just did. I'm serious. I'm not playing with you. I'm serious, too, baby. Things just take time and they have to be done right. Done right? What the hell does that mean? What needs to be done right? Listen, you gotta be patient, all right, and show a little self control. Patient? Yeah. Patient? I think I've been more than patient and I'm tired of being your other woman. They're are plenty of men out there that will gladly take your place. Now look, woman. I gotta make sure that everything is right before I can officially be with you, okay. I gotta make sure I'm living comfortably. I mean, we are living comfortably. Relax. You have to stop tripping, okay. You're gonna be the mother of my kids. All right? You promise? Yes. Now show me that pretty smile of yours. You get on my nerves. You gotta stop tripping. But I do gotta go. All right. I'ma text you or call you or you know. Working late again, huh? Brenda please don't come down here starting this shit, man. I'm serious. I'm tired. Start what, Daniel? What kind of office hours are you keeping anyway? You know and you just come home from work, come straight down here without even speaking to me. Yeah. You don't make that much money. I pay for most of this. Being gone all the time. How are we supposed to fix the problems with us? Are you done running your fucking mouth, Brenda? I told you I wasn't in the move for this shit. I been at work all day. Yeah. Busting my ass trying to make some money so I don't have to have you throwing it up all in my face that you paying for all the bills or that you paying for all of this and that you make so much more fucking money than me. I'm sick of this shit. Did you cook? Did you make us dinner? I smell food. Oh. Well if you smell food, then I obviously made dinner for us. Who else would I make dinner for, Daniel? It's me and you because you don't want any kids, remember? - Really? - Yeah. How does me asking you about dinner start an argument over kids? I mean like real who does that? What's wrong with you? I try to be a good wife. I cook. I clean. I bring home the bacon. You don't even make love to me anymore. You don't even look at me half the time. Do you not love me anymore? Do you want out of this marriage? Brenda. The only thing I want is for you to leave me the hell alone. I asked you just for some space. Please? You are a sorry excuse for a man. You can't even answer the question. You want me to answer that? Yeah. You really want me to answer that? Yeah, I do. I want you to answer the question. Are you not attracted to me? I mean, what's there to be attracted to, Brenda? Look at you. You're dressed like you're a 60 year old woman. You're only 30, baby. And matter fact since we in this, you always talking about how much money we got, right? But do we ever do anything fun? Do we ever do anything? And I told you that I wanna get my production up and running, but do you care? No, you don't. Do you care about anything that I got going on? No, you don't. Have you ever supported me? Have you ever encouraged me to do any damn thing? No. You don't. You are such an ass. You know what? I'm not gonna spend my good money on stupid stuff like your pipe dreams. Pipe dreams? Yeah, I'd rather save the money for a rainy day or invest it and actually make money for us. We are not kids anymore. We are responsible adults. Really, Brenda? Pipe dreams? Yeah. Let's not forget that my artist was making hits while I was an A&R, Brenda. Then I decided to come work for your damn family in this bullshit loan office. Well, if it wasn't for that bullshit loan office, you wouldn't have a job. And if it weren't for that, you wouldn't have anything. Yeah. And guess what? Your so called production company, went ran straight into the ground. Bring up your damn family. Oh, your family and all this. Go 'head, Brenda. Run to your damn family. I can't do this right now. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna go upstairs and go to bed 'cause it's getting late. Okay. Enjoy your dinner. Goodnight. You didn't make me anything to eat? I didn't think you wanted anything. And you drunk up. Must've run out. Working normal hours again today? Daniel. Daniel. What, what? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. You sure? Yeah, just work. I'm swamped. Okay. Well, Steven told me to ask you did you want any lunch. No, no. I'm all right. I'm good. Okay. He just. He seems different. Just distant. Every conversation ends in a fight. Maybe it's time to walk away. We weren't raised like that. You know it. See that's your problem. Acting all sadiddy like you can't admit when you made a mistake. That's easy for you to say. You have a great marriage. You did too until what? What? You can't be that naive. What are you talking about? He's cheating on you. You said y'all haven't been having sex. He comes in all hours of the night. He's a man. What do you think he's doing? I don't believe it. Well then you're a fool. You need to open your eyes, girl. Maybe you should get a little sidepiece of your own. Show his ass. So man, what's been going on in your perfect little life? Ain't nothing in my life perfect, buddy. Trust me. Bullshit. You got a sexy ass wife with a good ass job. Shit, dude. She has benefits. She's taking care of all the bills. And you got that sexy mistress on the side. Perfect like my ass you do not have. Yes, you do. Yeah right. That's the point. She makes more money than I do, so she's always holding that shit over my head and it's just I can't take it anymore. She's tripping. Matter of fact, I just don't love her anymore, man. Period. But now Rachel. Oh my god, she's young, sexy, vibrant. And the sex. Oh my god, the sex. That good? That's what I'm saying. How am I gonna get out of this marriage, man. I mean she makes more money than I do and I don't make enough to just leave on my own. And then you know everything that I have, I'm putting towards the production studio. I don't have enough to leave on my own and I'm not gon' lie. I love my life and I'm comfortable living it, man. So I think I'm just gonna end up riding this train for as long as I can, buddy. You're gonna get burned, bud. That's the point. I'm too smooth to get burned, dude. Crazy. I remember back in college you were chasing her ass around like a lovesick puppy. You finally got Brenda. Then what happened? Guess what? Things have changed. You mean people change. No, no, no, no. People don't change. Just their situations. All right man, so tell me about this. When this situation arrives and Brenda figures it all out and divorces your ass and you become homeless, then what? 'Cause I'm not taking your ass in. Don't worry about taking me in. I got this all under control. It will be handled. I like having my ice cream and eating it, too. You stupid. It's having your cake and eating it, too. Whatever, cake, ice cream. It's all the same to me. I like both of them. Let me ask you this though. 'Cause you a doctor, right? Yeah. What's up? I was looking at Facebook and I saw these two chicks and one of 'em played a prank on the other one. Gave her some fish poison or something like that. Like what would that do to a person? Well shit, man, it depends on what type it is. I mean, some of it can cause instant heart attacks. I mean, it's virtually untraceable. Oh. Heart attack, yeah. I mean, I was just curious, you know. I mean, it's pretty fucked up what people are doing these days. I seen the ER way too damn much. Damn, yeah. Fucked up. Shit's getting crazy out here, man. All right, I'll grab the ball. Yeah, get that. You look tired, babe. How was your day? I was in court all damn day long. Man, this damn divorce is killing me, man. I'm just so ready for this shit to be over with. What is it gonna take for you guys to end this? How much longer before we can live a regular life and start my music? Babe, I told you it's a lot more. It's not that easy, Rachel. I gotta worry about my house, my cars, my investments. All of these things. It takes more time. I refuse to let this woman get me for half of everything I own, including the production company that we're trying start up. All right? I'm not going out like that. She's not gonna get half of all our profits and even your music and I told you, all right, when I first met you we would work on your music as soon as the divorce was settled, okay. Just stay in the studio until I'm ready. I mean, I understand we don't wanna lose anything, but I'm just tired of this little bitty ass apartment. We need something bigger, especially for the baby. Listen, come here. When it's time for us to have our family, I promise we will have a big ass house, okay, and all this will be in the past. You promise? Yes. I promise. Okay. Okay? Yeah. I'ma be right back. Good. Hey. What? What's wrong with you? Why you looking like that? We may need that bigger place a lot sooner than you think. Why, what you mean? What's wrong? I'm pregnant. Are you serious? Wait, I know you not mad. No, I'm not. Come here. No, no, no, baby. Come here, come here, come here. Just excited, okay. You caught me off guard. All right? I wanna have babies. You know that. And I wanna have them with you. Okay? Yeah, I just. I thought you were gonna be upset. No, baby, no. I'm not upset. We're gonna have a little musical family. You know, like the Jackson Five, okay. I just gotta move things a lot faster now. All right? Okay. I'll make you something to eat. What do you want? You. You so nasty. You like it, but I'll eat whatever you want me to, sexy girl. Hey, I forgot to tell you I gotta go out of town next week on a business conference again. Are you serious? I hate when you go out of town. Got to. It's business and we definitely need the money now. Right? I know. When do you leave? Sunday, but I'll call you before I get on my flight. Okay. Baby. What is this? These are for you. Listen, come here. I know I said some very hurtful things to you, all right. I've been under a lot of stress with job and work trying to make money. And I didn't mean any of that. Honestly I'm just not where I wanna be right now in life and I think you know that. But I'm trying to make adjustments and it's been rough. I know. It means a lot to me that you're trying now, babe. I still think you are very beautiful. All right? And I love you. I love you, too. You said some really hurtful things the other night. Well I know. I'm trying to fix our problems. Fix us. I really love you, babe. Love you, too. And you know I didn't mean any of that. And I honestly apologize and I'm gonna spend the rest of this week making it up to you, okay. I got a date night lined up for us and everything. A date night? Yeah. We're gonna go to Tailfeathers. We haven't been there in forever. I know. I know you like Tailfeathers. I do. I just wanna make this work, okay. I don't want our marriage to end. And I want to start a family. A family? Yeah.

I'm Detective Malone. This is Detective Smith. Is Mr. Thomas home? No, he's not, but I can give him a message if you like. Yes. We would like to ask him some questions regarding his wife's death. What type of questions? I doubt if he knows anything. Weren't you at the funeral, Miss? Rachel. My name is Rachel and yes, I was at the funeral supporting my fiance. - Fiance? - Fiance? How could you be his fiance when he was still married to his wife? They were in the middle of a nasty divorce. Is that what he told you? We have records showing that Daniel put a $500,000 insurance policy out on his wife four months ago. How long have you been seeing him? We've been together for six months now. And I'm also sorry to tell you that Daniel wasn't going through a nasty divorce battle. There's no records indicating that they were even separated. No, he wouldn't lie to me. I mean, why would he? We. We have a child on the way. Whoa. You have a child on the way? I'm sorry to hear that, but when you talk to Daniel, you tell him to give us a call 'cause we will be in touch. It's very important that he contact us. I'll give him the message. Thank you. Do you believe she had no clue about what's going on or is she lying? Well, she did look shocked from what we told her. Besides, her actions said enough. We gotta dig a little deeper. Something's not adding up and I doubt his side chick was gonna be any help. His side chick knows as much as we do now. We can't let this son of a bitch get away with this shit. We've gotta find out more. Oh, Detective. Who let the tiger out? I've never seen you this upset over a case. I just I hate a liar and a possible murderer. We don't even know if he's done anything wrong yet, nor do we have any evidence. Well let's go find some then. Come on. Hello. I don't remember turning that TV on. Hello. What are you doing? I've been calling you all day. It's about time you got home. Why you in here with the door locked? Because it's some weird shit going on in this house, Daniel. Like what? First, I keep getting these phone calls and no one is saying anything. Then, there's a woman's voice on the other end. Next the damn TV turns on by itself. I mean, what the fuck is going on? Are you done? Oh you think that's funny. Stop laughing. Baby. This is your first night sleeping in a big house by yourself. I'm pretty sure you're hearing things. No. Okay, it happens. And you're probably just a little creeped out 'cause I used to live here with my wife. It's okay. No, that wasn't it, Daniel. But whatever. Relax. Would you relax? God. So I decided to lock myself in this room and I ain't even thinking about touching that phone. Oh and on top of that, you had some visitors today. Visitors? Rach, what visitors? I told you at the funeral that I didn't want any of them people coming back to this house. I mean that, Rachel. It wasn't any of them, Daniel. These two detectives came asking some questions about your wife. What detectives? Baby. I don't know what they could want. I mean, well I don't know what they could possibly want. Hm. Well they mentioned that you took a $500,000 insurance policy on her months ago. Oh. Also found out some other news. That you two weren't getting a divorce. Daniel, why do the police think that you have something to do with your wife's death? - Relax. - No. So you're admitting that you weren't getting a divorce? Baby. You know that I was getting a divorce. You already know that. Stop letting these cops fill your head with all this craziness, all right. And you know my wife died. She had a heart attack. It's already been proven during the autopsy. Okay? Relax. Stop tripping. Come here. Matter fact. Why don't you come help me get cleaned up? Wanna take a shower? Mm hm. Yeah. I like that. Come on. What is that? That's the phone. Oh baby. Daniel. What, what, what, what? What? What? What's wrong? A woman's face. What are you talking about? What woman's face? A woman's face was in the mirror. Man, are you? Daniel, she looked like your wife. Baby. She was in the mirror, no. Baby, you're imagining things again. Ooh, come listen. No, I'm not, Daniel okay. She was in the mirror. No, baby. Nobody's in the mirror. Calm down. Yes, Daniel please. Just imagining things. Are you kidding me? No, somebody was in the mirror, baby. Daniel, you're not listening to me, okay. I'm telling you I'm hearing stuff and seeing stuff and I saw her face in the mirror. Baby, you didn't see nothing. Yes I did, Daniel. Freaking phone calls and nobody saying nothing. TV's turning on all by itself. You're just lonely in the house by yourself. I'm not lonely, Daniel. I'm terrified. I'm scared. There's stuff going on in this house and you're not paying attention to it. Oh my gosh. Seriously? What? Nothing happened. I. Oh my god. What the hell happened to the lights? See, no. The power just went out. No, Daniel. Just calm down. No. I'm getting a flashlight. No, I can't. Hurry up. Calm down. No, see. Daniel, did you hear that? No, what was that? No, where are you? I'm here. Come here, relax. I got the light. The door closed. Did you see the door close? I'm here. Yes, relax. Relax. No. The lights are still off. Baby, it's just the pressure. Relax. No, Daniel, Daniel. What the fuck is that? Killer? Who did this? No, Daniel. How did that happen? Baby, I don't know. Then how in the hell is it on there, Daniel? Baby Rachel, I don't know. I was with you. I told you. I told you. You're not listening to me and I told you, see. What the fuck is this? How did this get here, Rachel? What is that? This is Brenda's wedding ring. So? What is that supposed to mean to me? I had this damn ring locked in a safe. Did you do this? No, fool. Why would I take your damn wife's ring out? Come on. I told you it's some stuff going on in this house. All right, hold on. Just. Just calm down 'cause we gotta. No, Daniel. Just give me a minute to think, okay. What are we gonna do? I said give me a minute. Daniel, Daniel. No, Daniel. No, no, no. No, hold on. This is too much. Wait. Hold on, baby. Daniel, wait. No. Shit. Hey, anybody out there, I got a bat. I'm not scared to use it either. Hold onto me, baby. You see something? Ain't nobody in here, baby. No, I heard something. I think. We good, honey. I think we good. Ain't nobody in here. No. I think we just. We were just tripping, okay. What the fuck? Holy shit. Who is that? Man, what the fuck, man? The TV. I told you the TV was turning on by itself. I told you. See, see, Daniel. What was that, Daniel? No, go see what it is. No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who is that? I told you the TV keeps turning on and off. It's something going on in this house, Daniel. Oh shit. What the fuck? Oh shit. Come on. Stay tight with me. Yo, that's Brenda's urn. Look, that's fucking foot. Those are footprints, Daniel. All right, all right. So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on 'cause they got... No, no. They're gotta be an explanation for this, all right. Let's just think about this. No, Daniel, what the hell is going on? Who is doing this? It's gotta be a joke, okay. Somebody's obviously playing with us. Does this look like a joke to you, Daniel? Unless they trying to blackmail me because they know. They know what? 'Cause they know, Rachel. They know what, Daniel? Somebody probably knows that I killed my wife. Wait, wait, wait. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby. Hold on. You did what? Listen, hey, hey. Come here, come here, okay. Listen to me, okay. I did that, okay. I poisoned Brenda but I only did that for us. I did it for me and you, baby, and the baby. Okay? Why would you do that? Baby. I did it for us. No. But no I don't. I don't know. I just saw some shit on the internet, baby. I didn't even think it would work, okay. But listen to me. Time out. So everything that the police said was true. No, baby, no. Yes, Daniel. No, listen, listen, no. Don't touch me. Baby, listen. I did this for us, okay. You said you wanted more of my time, okay. And then you went and got pregnant... So wait. So it's my fault? No. It's nobody's fault, okay. But I did this for us, baby. I didn't wanna lose you. You are sick. You know that? You got me in your damn wife's house who you killed and you don't feel some type of way about that? No, baby. You're sick bastard, Daniel, and I'm leaving. You're leaving? Oh, so you gon' leave me now, huh? After all the shit I done for your ass. You gon' leave me? That's what you wanna do? So what? You gon' kill me now, too? I didn't put these cigarettes. Man, what's the deal? What's going on? I got your message. You okay? Do I fucking look okay, Brian, huh? Some freaky shit is going on in that damn house, man. Plus Rachel left me. What do you mean freaky shit, dude? I mean, what are you talking about, bud? Crazy ass shit's going on in that house, man, all right. Like what? Talk to me. That's Brenda's wedding ring, all right. I had that locked away in a safety deposit box, but it ends up on my damn nightstand last night. It's a fucking wedding ring, dude. Shit, maybe you thought you locked it up. I mean, hell. So much happened in such a little time. Maybe your dumb bimbo took it out to be funny. I'm not playing, man. This is not funny. You want me to prescribe you something, bud? No, I don't want you to prescribe me nothing. It's not it. There's more. Somebody keeps playing on my damn phone, man, and every time I answer it, it's like a lady just screaming in my ear, man. Then somebody wrote on my mirror said killer. Rachel was at the house last night. She said she even saw Brenda's face in the damn mirror, man. She saw Brenda's face in a mirror? Yeah. All right, bud. She's not the brightest. I mean she's fine and all, but her elevator doesn't reach to the top floor. You know what I'm saying. I'm not playing, Brian. I'm serious. I think Brenda's after me, man. Look. I got something to tell you, man, but you gotta promise me that you're gonna take this to your grace, all right, Brian. Promise me, Brian. Dude, I promise. Dude, what is going on okay? You're scaring me. Looks like you haven't slept in days and you're shaking. You're smoking. D, this is not you. I fucking killed her, man. What are you talking about? I killed Brenda. Now I feel she's fucking after me. You did what? Look, look, I know, man. I didn't mean to. I mean. I don't know. That's why these two detectives have been asking me questions. What detective? They came to my office the other day and started asking me about you and Brenda's relationship. I mean, what'd you say? Shit, I told them that last time I saw you guys, it was at our usual couple's event. Hell, you guys seemed fine there so I told 'em that. All right, good, good. Good, you was on your toes. That's good. Good thinking. That's what's up. Okay. Man, when you said you were gonna take care of things, I didn't think. What did you do to her? You remember that fish poison I was asking you about? She had a heart attack, man. You're crazy. That's why you were asking me about that shit, isn't it? Yeah. Look, you my man 50 clear and all, but I'm a doctor, okay. Shit dude, I can't be mixed up with what's going on right now with you. You're on your own, man. They already questioned me at my office. I gotta go. Wait, hold on. So you just gon' leave me? You supposed to be my brother, man. Look, man... What am I supposed to do? I love you to death, okay. Lay low. Don't do anything stupid. Shit. You need fucking help. Brian. Brian. Hey partner. I got a gift for you today. Man, I sure hope you do. Nothing would make me happier than to nail this son of a bitch. I got his wife's autopsy back today. It's a full report of everything that was in her system. Guess what was in it. Ciguatera. Fish poison? Yes. Why didn't poison show on the preliminary autopsy? The preliminary autopsy only showed that she had a heart attack, but fish poisoning. That's a whole lot harder to detect in the bloodstream. All we gotta do is link him to it. That son of bitch. We close. Let's take a ride. I'm waiting on you. Daniel. Daniel. Who is that? Who's that? What the hell, man? What the hell, man? Trouble you ain't nothing. I finna come back in there. So you better get on by, man. What the fuck is this? I know it's you, Brenda. Daniel. Daniel. Shit, man. Oh shit. Malone. Yeah. Yeah, we know him. Right now? Okay, we'll be right there. You'll never guess who's in interrogation B. Who? You gotta see this to believe it. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on. I need y'all to really just listen to me for a minute. Sit your ass down. Come on, man. Nice to see you again, Mr. Thomas. Look here, man. Y'all gotta help me, man. She's trying to get me. Who's trying to get you? My wife, man. My wife Brenda. Is this some kind of joke? Why would your dead wife be after you? She's trying to kill me, man. I don't know. She's trying to kill me. I don't. Think she's trying to get revenge. I don't know but look whatever. Man, if you don't believe just go to the house. You can go to the house yourself. It's written all over the damn wall. Killer. Betrayer. Murder. All of it's written at the house. Just go to the house and you can see for yourself. Look. I'll entertain this for a minute, but once again why is your dead wife after you? I killed her, man. All right, that's what you want me to say 'cause I killed her, all right. I killed my wife. Is that a confession? And I think she's after me now. She's trying to get revenge now. Is it? No, it ain't no confession. I just don't wanna go back to the house. Just keep me out of the damn house. Can you do that? Oh, don't worry. You're not going back to the house. No, listen. No, no, no, no, no. Mr. Daniel Thomas. No. You're under arrest. No, listen, man. Of the murder of your wife Brenda Thomas. Come on, man. Anything you say or do will be held against you in the court of law. Get him up. Listen, no. I'm not crazy, man. Call Rachel. Hello. Yeah. It worked. He turned himself in just like I planned. Uh huh. No, no, thank you for your help. Expect a nice package in your account soon. Talk to you later, bye. Hey. Hi, baby. So I'm guessing he turned himself in. Yeah, thank you for saving me. I did what I can. I just dropped everything and told him. Yes, may I help you? I think my husband is trying to kill me. Do you have proof? Proof? I'm telling you I'm afraid for my life and you're asking me for proof? Has he ever abused you? No. Then all we can do is register your complaint, ma'am. I'm telling you he's trying to kill me, please. You're my last hope. We need proof. This is protocol. I'm sorry. Don't worry, okay. You are safe with me. He's been talking crazy like he's trying to get rid of me. Just be careful, okay. Don't eat or drink anything he gives you. Okay. Glad to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. What is this about? You find out that I'm sleeping with your soon to be ex husband? So what? Shouldn't you be talking to him? No, sweetie. He's not my soon to be ex yet. Seems he's been playing you. He's a liar. He uses people and he's using you. Brenda, what do you want with me? I need your help with something. I'm happy to return the favor. And I'll make it worth your while. There's more where that came from. I look forward to your call later today. Fuck. Are you okay? Yeah. I. I gotta go. I gotta get out of here. Brenda?
