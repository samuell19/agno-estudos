And here we have Barnett Newman on one side on the right hand side of the gallery, and Ad Rheinhardt on the other. Here, in the penultimate gallery, gallery 11, you have 10 monumental canvases by Clyfford Still. Well, Clyfford Still, one of the most enigmatic, mysterious, toughest, most emotional, of all the great American abstract impressionists. Jackson Pollock said that Clyfford Still makes the rest of us look academic. He was just a very clearly strange individual. I never know of anybody who was quite so off the wall as he. It's a quote from Pollock and I think it's 1947, when he says, "Clyff Still, Rothko and I, "we change the face of painting." Who's Clyfford Still? Well, we're still finding out. We weren't even allowed to know, for decades and decades, he famously sort of absented himself at the height, or at the end of abstract expressionism. I don't think he removed himself from the world of art, from the world of ideas. He definitely removed himself from the art world. He had to get away from what he called the corruption of the art world. He was more interested and more firmly convinced about an artist doing what Still felt that artists should do. Paint. He kept himself apart, he was a very secretive man. And if you make yourself an outsider, then people who look at the movement are going to put you outside the movement, as simple as that. You know, it's not a popularity contest, and art and life are incongruous to each other. I mean, you make a decision that you wanna do that, it doesn't mean that you're gonna be in favor all the time. It doesn't mean that you're gonna have, there are gonna people who don't understand what you're doing. Painting is about time. Painting is about death, and you're making a physical fact. And paintings bring you into their present whenever you get in contact with them. For years and years and years, my parents would take me to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to see whatever the exhibition of the time was. And I have a vivid memory of seeing Still's work at the museum there, I was probably 10 years old. And what I remember about it was a particular painting that I focused on, kind of human sized, maybe six foot high, largely black painting. And what captivated me was that the title of the painting listed on the label was "Self Portrait." There was nothing about this that a 10 year old could in any way, shape, or form, think of as a self portrait. And I was hooked. I didn't understand this at all, but I was completely captivated and that was my introduction to modern art. I was very much impressed not only by his own person and persona but in terms of his intellect and his integrity about his own work, how it was to be displayed, all those things of course that would drive museum directors a little crazy perhaps, but, but that's the way it was with him. I loved him but I was terrified of him you know, because he did look like God as some, one of the painters so kindly said. He turned out to be an extraordinary artist, and I'm proud and lucky that of all his contemporaries that I got to be his daughter. It's a complicated journey that the guy went on. It's also a real story of America. It was as a journey that one must make walking straight and alone. No respite or shortcuts were permitted and one's will had to hold against every challenge of triumph, or failure, or the praise of vanity fair. That's the recorder, tape recorder. I remember when he bought that, he came home with it. Audio tape? - Audio tape, yes. Jesus Christ. Why didn't you tell me about... - 30, how many hours did you come up with Jess? 30? - 34. 34 hours of audiotape. Do I know this? Well okay, I want you to hear this. Which one is this? This is our new machine, we just got it today. And it's all ours. Well on the one hand I'm amazed at an archival discovery of this kind, and on the other hand it doesn't surprise me that much because Still was really very, very, intent on recording everything he did, and this is an expression of that kind of mindset. Creatively reflecting the anxious temper of the times is modern art and impatience with old-fashioned forms and limitations had launched the 20th century artist on a restless search for new ways of expression, and for new techniques. If they are to find a place in the civilization of the next half century, the visual arts must in effect compromise with the machine. This can be done, only within the terms of what we call abstract art. Abstract Expressionism was an American art movement that developed during and after the Second World War, that fused the relatively recent idea of an abstract art, with the age-old tradition of Expressionism. Before that virtually all the artists had lived through the Great Depression and they were marked by that for decades to come. There's a strong argument to be said for the idea that Abstract Expressionism really mirrors the age of anxiety Abex if you call it was such a huge movement in the United States, it went all over the world. One of probably the largest exports that this country still has exported. It's sometimes called the School of New York and that's a complete geographical misnomer. It spans both coasts of the United States West Coast and the East Coast, and significantly, Still was actually moving between those coasts in the 1940s with his Jaguar Still, moved around a heck of a lot. He was peripatetic. Location, with the exception of Alberta prairies, didn't mean a lot to Still. Clyfford Still has a very important one-person exhibition in the Bay Area in 1947 at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, that includes almost exclusively works that we would now call Abstract Expressionist. This is the exhibition that Rothko said left not only him but everyone else who had seen it breathless. Still and Rothko talk together at the California School of Fine Arts in 1946, and it's no coincidence that 1946 was the very year when Rothko began to make his breakthrough into abstraction with his so-called multiform canvases. Yes, I was first aware of Mark Rothko who taught at the California School of Fine Arts at the same time my dad did, and we would have dinner with him occasionally, but I remember he was a presence in the school. I think dad thought he found a kindred spirit. Dad analyzed him, they were good friends, dad said were kind of different species. Still was from this Wild West so to speak of Canada, Rothko was more European, a more sentient person. Interestingly the criticism that surrounds his exhibitions in San Francisco starts Still off on this relationship, bad that he will have with art criticisms. In 1943 they spell his name wrong twice, in 1947 I think, the critics are only met with baffling images that they don't even know how to read let alone interpret. Mark Rothko introduces Still to Peggy Guggenheim who had opened a gallery called Art of the Century in New York during the Second World War. She knew what Clyfford had was extraordinary and even admitted "I'm really more into surrealism "but I will show you." Rothko helps stretch the paintings, wrote on Stills work, he installed his first one-man show. And Rothko told him, "Please come to New York, this is Mecca." So Clyfford went to Mecca, we all followed. He liberated their work, their work changed almost overnight because of him. They were fumbling, "Where do we go from here?" And Clyfford provided them with the answer, get rid of the frame, go inward, what is that that you have to say and so on, and their work blossomed. There exists a fantastic photograph that appeared in Life magazine in 1950, that we call the Irascibles Group, that includes all the seminal figures of the Abstract Expressionist movement, and particularly Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Those four who were famously called by Betty Parsons the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I think of what Diebenkorn said about Clyfford Still when he was invited to go to the studio in the bottom of the California School of Fine Arts, he said, "Well, his stuff was very austere. "it didn't have anything to do with, with European painting, it was it was fiercely independent." "It was not seductive, it was very American, "it was rejecting influence." Well, that's a lot to say and it's a lot to undertake, and I think that Clyff stood for that. Of the group he was the roughest one. The edge is a little more jagged, you can see the paintbrush strokes, you really saw his hand and you saw the struggle. You're not sure if he's referencing nature, you're not sure if he's referencing. You don't know where those points come from. They look like oscilloscopes in a way and at the same time they're like mountain ranges. You kind of travel over all the marks that are painted in the paintings, so there's a real voyage that you take when you look at those things. When I hang a painting I would have it say, "Here am I. "This is my presence, my feeling, myself. "Here I stand implacable, proud, alive, "naked, unafraid. "If one does not like it, he should turn away, "because I am looking at him." It went well for a time, but then who did what, when, where, became an issue. Who painted something first? Dad would start to back off and back off. When Dorothy Miller did the "15 Americans" in 1952 she really had a tough time. Because Still was given his own room, Rothko was given his own room, and are almost in rivalry with each other. Rothko wanted blazing lights to bring out the intensity of the colors, and on the other hand, Still showed a very famous painting, a big, black painting that's now in the Art Institute of Chicago, and he called it a "big black monster". And it's as if you've got these two artists really, kind of you know, fighting against each other almost, to outdo each other. The fact that these two artists fought for their own rooms at a point in their career where they were still very young and not well-known to anyone, shows a certain audacity, and I think, belief they had in what they were doing. I think after "15 Americans" in '52 the tension between them starts to grow and grow, until they completely break from each other. Clyfford Still is particularly watching the path that Mark Rothko takes. Very actively involved with art museums and galleries, commercial galleries and various public commissions, like the Seagram's murals later in the 1950s. I think this all says to Clyfford Still that Rothko has gone to the other side. And I think Still turns out to be right given the deep depression that Rothko starts to face in the 1960s that eventually ends with his suicide in his studio in 1970. He didn't begrudge that. He didn't begrudge that at all. He understood it, he also understood that Rothko stopped being creative, growing. They all stopped growing as soon as that particular work became important. Pollock got killed, killed himself. Rothko did too. And dad felt like Rothko had sold out, and I guess Rothko was pretty upset about that, because I remember walking down the street in New York, in the early 60s, and there was Mark Rothko coming toward us, and he looked so angry. He looked at dad, and it was just sad, because he understood what dad was doing, but he couldn't commit to it. His excuse was, "I have a family to raise." Still, in some ways, almost predicted this outcome for Rothko. They hadn't spoken in many, many years. When Still was in Buffalo visiting his paintings at the Albright-Knox, the news was delivered to him and Still was known to have said. "Evil falls to those who live evil lives." He might have said something, but I just don't ever, never remember him, talking about Rothko as evil. Kind of failing his art maybe, but I never heard him use the word evil once about any of them. Well that kind of quote you know, it's pure Still. Very aphoristic, very moralistic. He said what he wanted to say at the end of the day. He was cutting out because he wanted to be cutting. I told Rothko on several occasions that he should abandon such nonsense, forget this myth thing which he was tying up to the Greeks. Rothko moved on, back where he belonged, into his fuzzy Bauhaus, cultural associations, and was very happy to leave the rigor I set, for the creative act for his steady manufacture of varieties of rectangles. Well you've got to remember that Still had a very difficult upbringing, and unlike most of the other, much more urbane, New York-based Abstract Expressionists, Still had a tough life on the Canadian prairies. The art historian Dore Ashton, recounted that Still used to talk to her about shucking wheat until his hands were bloody. He was a free laborer to his father and he was treated that way. It was nothing romantic about that kind of farming and survival. This is struggle, this is hard. When I look at the earlier works, the romantic trains that he did, and if you look at the photographs that he took, and I think it was around 1929, pretty barren land. Trains were freedom. The smoke going across, that's to civilization. The vertical is crucial to Still. Sometimes it might be smoke rising from a train, it might be a figure, but he said, "Where I come from, you either stood up and lived "or lay down and died." The vertical amounts to a life force, as he put it, lifelines. The space is what in the later paintings will become the extraordinary chromatic fields and gulfs of the abstractions, and this struggle between the vertical and between an empty field-like space is absolutely central to Still's entire art. I asked him one time, I said, "What is this thing about the lifeline?" And he said, "Well when I was a little kid "up in Canada when my father was farming "on very, very bad land, "they were digging a well, "and they dug this well down, you know, "20, 30 feet something like that, "and they needed to get somebody down there "to see if they've gotten as far as the water. "So they tied a rope around my ankle "and dropped me down the well slot, you know, headfirst." And he said, "It was such a traumatic experience that it remained with me all of my life." Whenever I see that lifeline I think of Clyfford hanging by his ankles down the well. There always been much imitation, but the record is still a history of a very few individuals. I see Barney for all his energy, a man of almost pathetic impotence. With a good mind he is incapable of transcending ambition. Only in the total destruction of this drive or in escape therefrom, will he ever be in a position to create more than a pathetic act. Clyfford Still did not admire Barnett Newman, period. He reduced Still to a nothing. Barnett Newman took Clyfford Stills lifeline and made a zipper out of it on a wall of color. We know art is not a race, but artists themselves, they're, they're very conscious of how they stand with regard to other artists, and no one wants to be left behind. Barnett Newman really first discovered his upright vertical zip no sooner than 1948. A painting called "Onement, 1" the point about Still is that he had been investigating the vertical since the 1920s. And there was a painting which was once known as "Quicksilver" and then "July 1945-R", which basically consists of a single, snaking, upright white line, surrounded by a dark brown abyss of darkness. That painting we know, was shown at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of the Century in 1946. That's two years before Barnett Newman's Onement, 1. Some of these men are deeply concerned in destroying the priorities which they know exist. I am ready to defend everything about those pictures with everything I have, and I have plenty. I have ample documentation for every picture as to date and place, and Newman knows this and so does Tom Hess. Interestingly, Still forms a close relationship with Pollock who is living in Long Island for most of the late 1940s and early 1950s. People forget that Jackson Pollock was one of the very few artists with whom Clyfford Still never fell out. In 1956, Still planned to take Pollock on a road trip west. Pollock looked up to Clyfford Still Pollock was failing, he was alcoholic. Pollock knew that Clyfford was getting ready to go cross country. He knew about these trips that happened often, and he wanted to go with dad, and he said, "Oh, I'll drive the Jag," and dad was "no, no", Pollock was not a good driver. He was a very dangerous driver and he said, "No, but join me, let's caravan." The car that Pollock wanted to drive is the one that was exchanged for a painting and a case of booze. So dad told Pollock, "We'll caravan. "I'm leaving Trenton," where he stored the Jaguar, "at such and such a time, "on such and such a day." And he waited for Pollock, he waited. No show. They open up Time or Newsweek, I don't know which one, and dad was just heartbroken. Pollock had taken a very different kind of road trip. The terrible fatal accident he had. And it disturbed dad, he told me the story many times. Still recognized Pollock's greatness and vice versa, I have not the slightest doubt about that. He made things impossible for Betty Parsons. She was allowed to sell the paintings but she wasn't allowed to show them virtually. After three very successful exhibitions at Betty Parson's gallery, he writes Betty with the following information, "I tell you now that I am withdrawing my work "from public exhibition." Those latter years in New York, he's in the very epicenter of the art scene and at the same time is completely removed from it. And that's a typical Still paradox. I think his exit was honorable and it was not manipulative, although he was manipulative. Well I think there's absolutely no question about that and it's just it doesn't matter how you paint or what you do, you are the only artist in the world, that's what the ego dictates. Just off Fifth Avenue on a site long occupied by the old-fashioned town dwellings of the Rockefeller family, stands the spanking new home of a nationally important institution, the New York Museum of Modern Art. Clyfford Still had a very tricky relationship with MoMA. I think he saw MoMA as the institutionalization of modernism itself, and that's what he really hated. He famously referred to it as that gas chamber of culture on 53rd Street. The Museum of Modern Art wanted to buy one of Still's paintings but one of, to him, a lesser painting, not a groundbreaking painting. He wanted them to take the big black with the red line. I'm quoting my father now, "They did not have "the courage to buy it." So what he did, is he went home and made a reproduction and though he did not literally paint it with his left hand, he said "Emotionally I painted it with my left hand, indifferently." Well I remember a show that MoMA did a couple of years ago in which they exhibited well over a hundred works from their holdings of abstract expressionism, and Mark Rothko got an entire room devoted to his work, but Clyfford Still had merely, had two canvases with a David Smith sculpture stuck in front of them. That kind of presentation showed how, in a way, MoMA has belittled Still compared to the other artists. I don't think there's any question there were two sides of Clyfford Still. Family members and his children described him in one way as being warm and passionate and a great father. Well clearly, by other documentation, there was a different Clyfford Still who would fight to the end when it came to matters of art. He turned down the Biennale at least three times, possibly a fourth. One or twice, one man exhibits to represent the United States because he felt it was a carnival, he didn't consider it a meaningful commitment to art of any kind, it was sort of a road show kind of attitude. Still was an outsider. He was irascible, it's said he could be cantankerous, he didn't have his reputation for nothing. Still was someone who didn't go along with the herd. Clyfford Still held critics in the highest contempt, because they felt they were more important than the artists. They made the artists. The critics and the dealers made the artists. If they get on your bandwagon they will take you to the top. Greenberg, Pollock, all of them had their boy, and it was their job to write about them and sell them. They were part of the product package. He didn't have any respect for them. He tried, he talked with them, he tried to educate them. Tell me when. "I consider the fawner," oh great, "called art critic, the least desirable "of those who've gained access to the work." I am an art critic. I could really care less what the artist thinks. I'm not writing for the artist. "I have steadfastly tried to withhold the work "from these characters, for many and obvious reasons, "not the least being their arrogance and stupidity." I'm writing for the audience. I'm writing for the reader. I'm trying to deliver up a full volume of my opinion of what I think of the work, where it fits in, what makes it original, what makes it unoriginal, what might or may not be inventive about it, et cetera. And if the artist doesn't like it I would say, "Good for you. "You don't own the meaning of your work." "Clement Greenberg is really a small and lecherous man," I'm told that's true, "who, if given his own way, "would prefer to study nudes and sentimental landscapes." What makes Clyfford Still pretty great art, is you, and I, and Clyfford, are looking at different paintings when we look at them. And better yet, they change every time. "So, occasionally I relax by writing a letter "to the likes of the art press. "Pimps is a much better word." Take it from the top. Tell me a little bit about that day." The day with the Ossorio, the day of confrontation so to speak. Well there's a little backstory to that. Interesting man. He would hold musicals in his home. Which is, specific painting was on loan to Ossorio. He would loan paintings, he wouldn't buy them. It didn't matter that he had money galore. Alfonso Ossorio inherited Domino sugar fortune. Clyfford was in on the West Coast. Ossorio announces I don't know that was through Patricia or to Patricia or by a letter to Still, that he's loaning the painting overseas somewhere. Still gets on the phone to Patricia and says "You call Ossorio now and you tell him "order that painting home." Ossorio wasn't gonna honor Patricia's word, he felt he had a right to that painting now and to do it that what he wanted. Dad came back to New York and on a very gray, miserable, I think it was in October, I'm not sure but it was not a pleasant month, they take a taxi to Ossorio's mansion on the bay. Knocked on the door and his, his housekeeper, this fellow opened the door and dad wanted to see Ossorio. Well he wasn't there. He wasn't around, supposedly, because he could tell dad was angry. He was on a mission. Diane, Patricia, and Still were going through the ground-floor looking for the painting, and according to what I remember written, Diane found it. He sends them to the vestibule, shuts the door, pulls out a knife, And then we heard this most awful sound of ripping canvas. He cut the center out and left a border of a couple of feet, folds it up, puts it under his arm and they leave. So I've got chills right now that I'm seeing part of that event. I didn't know it was preserved, oh my. Now the story changed a little bit as the years went on where Ossorio comes down the steps because the house boy went up to get him, and dad said, "I forgot I had the knife in my hand," and shook it under his face and said, "When I give you an order about my work you obey me." And I think Ossorio was terrified. He thought he was gonna cut his throat. And he did refer to it as "I cut the heart of the painting out of the canvas." This is my mother when she was early thirties. Yeah, and he said he deliberately cocked her head back where she looked stubborn, because she could be very stubborn, which would drive him crazy. My mother was four and dad was six, would go hand in hand to church. I think they knew they were meant to be at least for a while. I think my mom Lillian had different kinds of expectations. Dad was supposed to be a professor or minister, and that was her expectation, to be the wife of a professor or a teacher. She was not happy. She had to wait for him to come home. Honestly, all of Stills teaching appointments ended poorly, usually with disagreements over schedules or deans and so forth. In Richmond in particular Still was incensed that the Dean said in passing that Still could paint whatever he wants, but he should be careful about having students over to his studio and home. And the thought of a Dean suggesting that Still needed to seek approval for painting in any which way led to his departure from Virginia. The concept, or almost inevitability, of a Patricia coming into dad's life, was there and potential for that. She was an artist, she was an art student, and Lilian was no competition, not that she wasn't beautiful but she was unhappy. By the time Patricia came, she was one of the students who came to the apartment and, you know, waited on bated breath for everything he said. Lilian had to produce the cookies and she felt nothing but a waitress by then. Alberta, Canada, he built a house there for us. It wasn't quite finished. There was no insulation and we were cold, and then he left. I thought, "Oh, that's odd." Occasionally he'd take us on a drive and a picnic and it would be Patricia with us, not mom. Mom was at work. Patricia was the one person that believed in him and stuck with him. Worked eight hours a day and then stayed up till 1:00 or 2:00 at night when the artists in those days were getting together. She was also very devoted to him obviously. She never referred to him as Clyfford, and I shouldn't even be calling him Clyfford. If she were here in this room she would remind me, "You please call him Mr. Still." Patricia was a very good record keeper. She was very methodical and frugal. She never gave up helping him survive. Paris designer Jacques Estrel unveils his fashions for next summer, and believe you me, he's way out there. Yes, he's a great believer in pop art, pop. And he believes in getting madam out of the kitchen, utensils and all. Pop art is just not on his, on his horizon at all. To him it was an inevitability, Andy Warhol a cartoonist, a graphic artist. I think Andy Warhol must have been the most cynical so-called artist out there. He played the game! Today the same kind of craftsman, with probably the same purpose, and with the same eye on the market, glorifies the popular taste by placing in the sanctum of the Art Gallery, the beer can, the ketchup bottle, the plaster pie, plastic toilet, and so as sacred as the term become, to the the observer or purchaser, gladly accepts. By the late 1950s Still, and I think many of the other Abstract Expressionists, sense a changing of the guard. A young generation of artists, and proto pop artists like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, are nipping at their reputations and making very different work that in some ways is critiquing the innovations of the abstract expressionist. Still pushes away, distances himself to the outer world after 1961 increasingly, and I think he sees that distancing as a kind of route to his own greatness. He has to create space which he himself can fill with his later work. Stills' late work basically begins in '61. In the summer of 1961, on my birthday, by the way, we got, dad, Patty, and I got in the car and started heading south because he remembered the lushness of the land in Virginia. The lushness that that land was just, ah. You can breathe, you can throw seeds and they'd grow. They looked at a couple of places and then found an overgrown 22 to 24 acre farm that a man had raised a family on and sent to college. They bought it for about $24,000, about $1,000 an acre, and that was a lot of money in those days. I think he was searching for a quiet place where he didn't have these extraneous noises bothering him and where he could concentrate and work. Still makes about 375 paintings during the last 20 years of his life, more than he had made in the previous 40 years, with a certain kind of emptying out of forms. The issue is, whatever way a serious, good artist, like Still was, you clear the noise. So find the way. Are you going to choose Clyfford Stills' way, are you gonna choose Agnes Martin's way of withdrawal? I mean whatever it is that's the discipline to be good at anything. He was just our dad but he wasn't there all that much. He made it very clear, very clear, and he bragged about it once when he said he leaned over my crib and said, "I love you babe, but you don't come first." I was five years old, we were in Richmond, Virginia, and I remember sitting in a big leather chair. I have white knuckles I think you'll notice in the picture. And he would give me breaks, but I was scared to death, sitting there and watching him, watching me. To suddenly be center of his attention was humongous. And when he reentered our life, always as a surprise, you know, dad's here! Life has returned, not to survival, but something extraordinary. He had energy, he showed us how to play baseball which was his favorite sport. He taught me to throw a ball like a man, and I just, I loved doing that. Still felt that the painter, the artist, was like a baseball pitcher. That everything on the field was quiet, everything was still as, not a play on words, everything was calm and then when the the pitcher let the ball loose, everything began moving around. Here's Joe Black in the 6th. Boom, Neville belts it over the fence in right field. Another artist once told me that baseball is an intellectual game. It's just not a bunch of guys running out on the field and hitting baseballs and throwing a ball around. There are endless possibilities of things that can happen during a game. Again the bases are loaded. Maybe this time, maybe Jackie Robinson can be the hero. Clyfford and I talked about that all the time, and he knew everything. He knew the statistics, he knew the players, he asked all the right questions, and I was overwhelmed that the knowledge that he had. Their 4th World Series in a row... So loved baseball, and he saw baseball I think as a kind of human geometry, and there's that famous time he says, "Well look at the spaces between the players." And that's, that's fascination with how the human presence interacts with the space around it. That's very central to Stills' art too, from day one. I never talked to Clyfford about one day owning a baseball team. The St. Louis crowd has visions of force faith, as Yankee Joe Pepitone flies out for the final hour. The first memory that comes to mind about people coming in trying to buy paintings directly from Clyfford Still, since he had no dealer, was a man that Frederick Wiseman introduced to Clyfford. The dealing and wheeling went on, "Oh, come down $10,000." You know, these are wealthy people and this particular person decided, "Well if I send him four pineapples, "from like a Harry and David's thing, "he'll come down in price." Well Patty tested one of the pineapples and she got sick from it. Dad took the other three and had target practice with the .22 rifle. Clearly the man did not get a painting. I probably thought about it for a while and probably wrote several drafts of that letter because I didn't want him to say no. And I got a response. "Mr. Still has asked me to thank you for your letter, "but to inform you that he has no pictures "for sale, lease, or loan to anyone at this time. "Sincerely, Mrs. Still." One of the things that I was probably taught early on is that "No is a temporary impediment on the way to yes," so I proceeded. I think we met in Baltimore for lunch. I remember talking about my interests, and him talking about his interests. His interest was talking about his colleagues, painters that he wasn't so fond of. In the end he had the right to speak that way because he was a giant. I wrote another note to him and asked if he was ready to see me and talk about maybe parting with some pictures and he said yes. Well he didn't trust very many people. He also didn't love a lot of people. He was he was very closely knit with his family, and a few friends, and I guess I was one of them fortunately. In 1964 Clyfford Still decided it was time to find a home for the paintings. One of the capstones for Still in the 1950s was a one-person exhibition at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo in 1959. He approached Seymour Knox, head of the board of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery about whether they would accept a group of paintings to be kept in perpetuity at their museum. It was a kind of grand scheme. One important consideration of that gift was that the paintings could never travel and that they must be seen in their own room and not mixed with other artists. As a museum director I find that to be a bit unfortunate. I understand it, but in terms of educating the public and I'm sure he didn't give a damn about educating the public, but in in terms of that that's one of the things museums feel that they are there to do, because people have a lot of difficulty, let's face it, with even something as old as abstraction is. When an artist wants their work to be seen en masse, in its own space, altogether, I get that. It isn't a grandiose wish at all. Artists are control freaks, they get an idea, moves from one work to another, I have nothing against them wanting the work to remain together. Time however treats art different than the artists wishes, and I trust time. When I think about Still I think about my first show at the Albright-Knox Museum and seeing the paintings that they have installed there, and then really rethinking who Clyfford Still was. What Clyfford Still was interested in was this slow time-based experience with painting. That slowed down kind of experience that goes past life. To make sense of that, it was like, incredible, and that was at the Albright-Knox. You have those moments, where you remember how art hit you. It was second week of December in 1979. I was home from my freshman year of college, my mom had moved to Buffalo. They had just had sixty inches of snow, which turns out it's not unusual, dumps from the lake and there it is, and I was wandering around 'cause I couldn't stay in her new little house and got out, and I show up at the Albright-Knox Museum. I didn't even know the history of how those cities like Buffalo and Cleveland and things have gotten quite wealthy and there have been all these expositions. So I walk in, and it's this extraordinary collection of American abstraction and American muscular spiritual modernism. So here's the weird thing that happened. The power went off. But I remembered this thing that I'd read about Still, where he says exactly that. Turn off the lights, the paintings have their own fire. You think, "Oh, come on" but, it's there and I felt that as a kid that day, and I'll never never forget the day. I don't know how many other times I've been with paintings in that way. It had been my hope that I would end up with in the four corners of the old San Francisco Museum of Art building, a room devoted to Mark Rothko, a room that devoted to Clyfford Still, a room for Robert Motherwell, and a room for Richard Diebenkorn. The four corners would have made it a wonderful and I think exciting balance. That didn't, didn't work out for me, but it did work out for Henry Hopkins. The museum already had a couple of his paintings, a big, big abstract painting from, that was a gift of the Anderson family in in Palo Alto, and then this marvelous painting that Peggy Guggenheim had given to the museum. A 1944 picture which was the picture that inspired my background, my initiation into Modern Art, and I think when on a visit to San Francisco in the 70, early 70s, he really respected and admired the way his work was being shown, and I think that inspired him to develop a closer relationship with the museum and with Hopkins, and that eventually resulted in the gift that we did receive. So he talked to me about giving three paintings to the museum which of course excited me, and over the next year and a half as we talked, and we talked every time we would talk. he would add three more, like well, maybe six would be better, well maybe we could tell the story with eight, well we can't really tell the story with eight it probably would take nine or ten to really tell the whole spectrum, and of course, but we ended up with an outright gift of twenty-eight Clyfford Still paintings, of which this big red one is one of the prime examples, though there are actually many in the collection. He gave a group to the Albright-Knox Museum. He gave this group to us, he gave a group to the Metropolitan Museum. I think that's juncture where Still starts to look back on his career and turn it into one great Odyssey, one great venture. It was about the right people will come. They will come, as he did, all the way from Canada to New York. On his 21st birthday he was at the front door of the Metropolitan Museum of Art waiting for the doors to open because he was finally going to see the originals not reproductions. Nothing was finally decided. However, they saw, and I don't think I've ever had two more receptive guys. The problem is do I want the entire gallery or just a floor? That's better, oh! - So we'll settle for one floor when the time comes up, now you'll try to keep it as quiet as you can for a little while. Yeah, I'll just yell about in the apartment. - All right. He's not having a grand retrospective of MoMA or the Whitney, it's the Met, and that is the Met's about the old masters and Still is very consciously positioning himself in that perspective. The Metropolitan Museum of Art perhaps the greatest center of classical art and learning in America, exerts an influence that is worldwide. For better or worse Still chose all the works from his own collection and he weighted heavily his work of his last 20 years. I went there December of 1977 and oddly enough suddenly there was Clyfford Still and his wife and well I was scared to death. I went up to him and I said I thought he was a great, great artist and I was overwhelmed by the work and I think he was okay, if you know what I mean? He didn't say a lot. I think he appreciated someone appreciating him. I had some excellent response from this exhibition, but some in fact, almost surprising, Lee Krasner, Pollock's wife, told Mr. Montebello and insisted he'd be sure to tell me that this is the greatest experience in art she'd ever had in her life. - Wow. It's quite, it's quite a tribute to me. - I understand. Of course I remember that day. Yes, that's Molly Brewer, I haven't talked to her in 40 years. Anyway, yeah, she was a student of Clyfford Stills in San Francisco, and I rented the front of my studio to her on 20th Street. She said "Clyfford Still's coming over today." I said "Really?" Said "Okay, yeah, and I, I'll go get some pizza." Which I did. I remember what paintings of mine were in my studio also. There was a painting called "Giacomo Expelled from the Temple." I thought he'd like that painting because it had a, I made it with joint compound and rope flex which was sort of a plaster, and I used a palette knife on it quite a bit, so I definitely related to his paintings. Oh, that's a pretty unusual little bit. Obviously he read the catalog pretty thoroughly. Oh, that's great. - Yes. Good. - I'd say the kid was 25 to 30 years of age, he was maybe 25. Nice, young, Polish, name of Schnabel, Julian Schnabel. Looked more Italian, round face, smooth voice, full of enthusiasm. Very rugged pictures, images, pictures. Taking the work seriously. I had to admit, the guy has roots that might develop into something. Originality for himself. Brings much of my whole attitude about it. By 1977, it's pretty obvious that Still's getting sick. He doesn't do much about it, doesn't see a doctor, and by the time the exhibition at the Met opens in 1979, he's essentially dying of colon cancer. There's a series of about 40 pastels on construction paper about six months before he passed away. He could feel something coming but he really wanted to get some last ideas down. The last pastel in this series, you can really just see that life force that's so prominent in his work just trail off the edge of the page. Last will and testament, paragraph fourth. I give and bequeath all the remaining works of art executed by me and my collection to an American city that will agree to build or assign and maintain permanent quarters exclusively for these works of art. For their exhibition study and survival, and it was really a 20-year quest to identify an American city who would agree to those terms. If you note, it said permanent quarters, that did not say I want a free-standing building all my own, that came from Patricia. Still understood that many of them might end up in a basement in storage and they might be shown once every five or ten years. He understood that. He did not want it distributed one here, one there. This is a symphony, or an opera, with some masterpieces called arias if you will, or movements. He saw it as a totality, that is why there's so many reproductions. He would sell or give a painting and say "I wish I hadn't done that." It was a huge estate, nobody had seen it, nobody really knew exactly what was in it apart from when it was appraised. And so, you know, Still in John Goulding's words as lately as 2000 he wrote that "Still remains a great unknown," and it's absolutely true. ♪ Vissi d'arte, ♪ ♪ vissi d'amore, ♪ ♪ non feci mai male ♪ ♪ ad anima viva ♪ ♪ Con man furtiva ♪ ♪ Quante miserie ♪ ♪ conobbi aiutai. ♪ - After 1980 it became clear that my aunt Pat's fundamental mission was to find a city that would accept the Clyfford Still paintings in the terms of his will. Now there was I think some tension in that, because she very much liked controlling all of this art. As devoted as Patricia Still was to her husband's art and life, she actually did considerable damage to his legacy. After his death in 1980 she refused reproduction rights to almost everybody. She wouldn't let anybody see the art and I think that was a terrible injustice to people of my generation, who were trying to understand Clyfford Still through 5% of the work in the world. After talking to my aunt for quite some time, I managed to persuade her that Denver could be a good place for the museum, and she sent me a letter giving me permission to go to Denver. And it says, "I was just thinking, what about Denver?" Well it was hard getting those words out of her but I got that letter and then called the Denver Art Museum. I'd been in office maybe, I don't know, a hundred days, and Lewis Sharp from the art museum called me and said you know, "There's this woman "who is the sole controller of one of the most incredible "collections of art in the history of the world, "and no one's really gone "and even pitched her in several years." I was gonna be in DC anyway, it was gonna be you know, about an hour and a half drive each way. You know, it was gonna take five hours out of my day, that's not a lot of risk for something that could really create another star in the cultural firmament of Colorado, and another reason for people that love art to come visit Colorado. Of course, when Lewis Sharp first presented the idea, I had no idea that 25, 26 other communities had attempted and failed at persuading Mrs Still that that their city was the place. We walked into the farmhouse, and it was almost devoid of furniture. One easy-chair in the living room, but basically pretty barren in terms of any kind of furnishings. Except for, in every room, there were painting after painting, they are rolled in these long rolls. Some of them were in tubes, many of them were not in tubes, just kind of piled into the corner. I couldn't help but having my mind run away with "God, what's in all those rolled up canvases?" And Clyfford Stills' widow was intensely loyal to her late husband. I mean she had foam-core models of what a museum might look like. And I grew up in a family with a lot of great aunts and you know, elderly men and women, and I've always been very good, I was trained to be very respectful and to listen very carefully when when one of your elders speaks to you, and I think that Mrs Still responded to that. 2,000 works by Clyfford Still have been in storage since he died. His will was specific about where they would go. To an American city that would both create and maintain a museum devoted exclusively to his artworks. Now Denver is that city. After long negotiations with Stills' widow, the collection will come here. It's very interesting when we got the letter, I think it was a letter, asking if we were interested. I mean I almost had to laugh, because I had known his work since my Columbia days. It's almost like we were just waiting to be asked. There's something terrifying about this landscape, when you take away the kind of mythos of the mountains and look east, the scalelessness of it, the vastness of it, right, you know. A way of kind of holding yourself in that world, you know holding, the building in this case, in that world, holding those paintings in this world, and in some way, his paintings were trying to do the same thing. Hold us all in the world in some way. We had just arrived in New York when I was a little kid. We've taken the train. And I had developed a very bad ear ache. So I was asleep in the living room. In the middle of the night I woke up and there's my dad, in the kitchen, painting. And that stuck with me so strongly that, "He's doing something important." And I was six years old. One of my worst moments was about 18 months before he passed. I woke up in the middle of the night and he was just restless and unhappy. I finally went over and sat beside him, he was sitting on the edge of the bed, and he's just, "Why am I doing this? "No-one's understanding this. "I should just go home and burn them all." He needed to know that someone believed in him. I learned not to have expectations any kind from him. Yeah, I thought it was a mistake when he left us each two paintings, two abstracts. I didn't think he'd trust us with them. Totally changed my life. It freed me, yeah. Freed me, it's gonna free my children someday, so thank you Dad. Although several large and significant areas of the work cannot be exhibited, I believe what will be shown will justify the interest and effort you have so courageously given.
