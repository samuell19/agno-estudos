Subtitles by Jobaier Imran. -You don't understand! [inaudible] taking every genealogists space. - None of that matters now. - Look, it matters to me. It matters that the only other person here is now crazy! - Protocol 214 B explains procedures for when you go nuts! -It's complicated! And I need you to understand! - You're acting crazy! -No! -What are you gonna do with those? -In May of 1941, the war had just begun. The Germans had the bigger ships, they had the biggest guns, the Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea. On their decks were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees. Out of the cold and foggy night, came the British ship The Hood. And every British seaman, he knew and understood, They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea ...Stop those guns. Stop those guns as big as steers and the shells as big as trees. We'll find that German battleship that's making such a fuss. We've got to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us. Hit the decks a running boys and spin those guns around, When we find the Bismark, we got to cut her down. The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day the Bismark started firing fifteen miles away, we gotta sick the Bismark was the battle sound. But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down. For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail. Churchill told the people "Put every ship a-sail." 'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she gotta be. We've got to sink the Bismark to the bottom of the sea. We'll find that Ger, am battleship that's making such a fuss. We've got to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us. Yeah hit the decks a running boys and spin those guns around. When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down. The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the morning sun. Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made it's run. The Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around. We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down. The British guns were aimed and the shells were coming fast. The first shell hit the Bismarck they knew she couldn't last. That mighty German battleship is just a memory. Sink the Bismarck was the battle cry that shook the seven seas. We found the German battleship it was making such a fuss. We had to sink the Bismarck cause the world depends on us. We hit the deck a running and we and spun those guns around. Yeah we found the mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down. We found the German battleship it was making such a fuss. We had to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us. We hit the deck a running and we and spun those guns around. Yeah we found the mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down. -What the hell is this? - I don't have the card and not just the card, it's not that it's your job... -It's your fault! You told me to tell her! -Now, look, I'm using the [???]! -I'm using the [???] -Alright, guys, don't argue about it. Wear something else and clean up for me. -With what? -Harold. Look what I found. -Standard issue. All flight kids have them. -Don't you think it's a little unnecessary in our... particular scenario? -Standard issue. Heard they were close. So far hunting blacks. Almost completely lost sight of everything. - Has it occurred to you yet that our distance is relative to growth? It's meaningless. How can I explain? It's like one of those... math problems. You know... if... if train A is traveling east at 85 miles per hour, And train B is also heading east at 85,000 miles per hour, at what point does train A catch up with train B? - You know, they never give you anything for nothing in this world. You gotta fight for it. All my life I've been a fighter. I fought for everything I've got; I've fought for everything that's in here. Fight, fight, fight. - The show must a lot for letting them fight. -I got to get a name for the kids. -Still straight? -Still away? -Hi, Lieutenant. - Some people say a man is made out of mud well a poor man's made out of muscle and blood. Muscle and blood and skin and bone. A mind that's weak and a back that's strong. You load 16 tons and whaddaya get?? Another day older and deeper in debt. Saint Peter don'tcha call me 'Cause I can't go I owe my soul to the Company Store. I was born one morning when sun didn't shine, I picked up my shovel and I went to the mine, Loaded 16 tons of number nine coal, And the straw boss said: "Well, bless my soul!" You load 16 tons, And what do you get? Another day older, And deeper in debt. Saint Peter, don't you call me, Cause I can't go, I owe my soul to the company store. I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain, Fighting and Trouble are my middle name, I was raised down the Canebrake by an old mountain mine, And there ain't no hard-hearted women make me walk that line! You load 16 tons, And what do you get? Another day older, And deeper in debt. Saint Peter, don't you call me, Cause I can't go, I owe my soul to the company store. If you see me coming, you better step aside, A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died. My one fist of iron, the other one of steel, And if the right one don't getcha, then the left one will. You load 16 tons, And what do you get? Another day older, And deeper in debt. Saint Peter, don't you call me, Cause I can't go, -Harold? What the hell was that? Harold?! What was that?! Harold! Harold? Damn it. Harold... Harold?! - You're the one who aggravates me. -I know. I've seen this one already. That's the one where he thinks his friend is dead, but he's really just asleep. It's like... he puts on this makeshift pre-stuffed and starts reading this guy's last rights. When the dummy finally wakes up, he... he starts freaking out because he thinks he's dying and... you're not gonna wake up. - Red said that all the guys like me down there. -Baby, you got to quit. -What a drag. You ain't coming back. That's what I'm asking you! How does this work? Still straight. Still away. Straight and away. - blue line... does it have anything to do with the color? -No, it doesn't. Just keep it down flat. You can't do it? You home? -No, this is good. I look like a statue. -I got that. Now, a little bit on the lighter side. Sometime after the courageous launch of ISRA 88, Dr. Abe Anderson and Lt. Col. Harold Richards continue their voyage through space. Here with us tonight... via two satellites... Dr. Abe Anderson and Lt. Col. Harold Richards. Gentlemen, welcome. And please tell us: how are you? -Hello, Mr. Westin! I'm... I'm doing really great. Thank you for asking. -Good... um, so... years in, Doctor, what do you and your pilot do to pass the time? -Um... well, a secondary objective of our mission was to observe the effects of zero gravity on the flight patterns of honey bees. Those bees recently died. So our results are inconclusive. Uh, either than that we... um... we have a hard drive full of old TV. -We had a pinball machine, but that... Broke. -Oh, well... one more question, uh...[indistinct] -I... I... I'm sorry. Mr. White, could you repeat that? We have some static on our end. -Sure. Any sign of your main objective? Any sign of the end of the universe? -Um... um... no, sir. We think it will be much, much longer before we see the end. The only... sign we can predict will come before our destination is the total loss of sights of all stars. Um... and even if this occurs, we have no idea how much longer our trip will be. -That's interesting. well, it, uh... oh! It's... I guess we're out of time. So, I would like to thank you gentlemen for joining us and we wish you a safe... - Goodnight. - and successful journey. Goodnight. -So the disk is above the blue line. Does it got anything to do with the color? - No. I suppose. Just keep it down flat. I can't do this. You in? -No, this is good. I look like a statue. -I don't know. Well, a little bit... - Some time after the courageous launch is premeditated, Dr. Abe Anderson offered... Dr. Abe Anderson and Lt. Col. Harold Richards. Harold Richards. Gentlemen, welcome. And please tell us: how are you? -Hello, Mr. Westin! I'm... I'm doing really great. Thank you for asking. - So, uh... years in, Doctor, what do you and your pilot do to pass the time? -Follow the Ophthalmoscope, please. ¿Cómo Se siente, Dr. Anderson? - Oh... okay. - You're like Lewis and Clark. - General Christie has a few things he would like to make clear. -Three. - What I am most curious about is the Multiverse. - First and foremost we would like to thank you. Your bravery for this mission is commendable. Your participation in this task is both strategic and necessary for the advancement of the U.S. Military... - Of course. There's always a possibility of cosmic uncertainty. - Furthermore, the would like to remind you you are still a private citizen. As science officer, you hold no military authority, nor do you represent this country, continent or planet. Under no circumstances are you to act as a representative for people of the United States -The universe is more contained than we originally thought. I thought it was going to curve like the bell of a trumpet...or...or spill out and spread like water from a hose, but -...you will follow military protocol. All forms will first go through General Christie before being submitted to publication. -Tiene pies pequeños. -...in accordance with section...15 -Just doesn't add up. Don't underestimate fictional realism. -Quite frankly sir, the U.S. military has final edit on all publications. Including but not limited to all news media, print-magazine and newspaper, -Unresponsive? -...as well as scientific... -We're working with theoretical numbers here. Right? I mean, this is beyond imaginary. If you can imagine. -If we deem your discoveries detrimental to the safety of this country, continent or planet, it will be deemed classified. Here are your release and waiver forms. -Levante su brazo, por favor. -Yes? Yes! Doctor... -Anderson. Doctor Abe Anderson. -Yes. Doctor Abe Anderson. I hope most of you have had the opportunity to read Dr.Anderson's publication. Yield Electricity. A marvelous piece. Come down; come on down. Mhmm... This two manned mission is the most advanced of its kind. The data we have collected thus far is remarkable. And we're not even in space yet. -Yes, but...isn't the data theoretical? It just seems too early. -Well, that's exactly it, doctor. All we have at this point are theories and hypotheses. Sir, this is the greatest abstract question of our world. And we have a chance for a physical answer. -It just seems like an unnecessary risk. -It is a risk we should take. This seems like the best time to introduce Lt. Col. Harold Richards. The military said something about equal parts brain and brawn, and so Lt. Col. Richards will be piloting out mission. With our collective minds, and the bravery of these two men, we can reach any distance and find every answer. Together, we will pursue as Kennedy said. Not because it is easy, but because it is hard. There is much we can discuss. Abe, you're gonna need to brush up on your math, And...uh, Harold, you're gonna need to discuss your protocol. You got your PhD in marine biology. Is that correct? -Yes. -Well... I think you'll find that, uh... floating in space is kind of like floating in the ocean. -Levante El brazo, por favor. -He's fainted. Grab the salts. -Possibly stress. The man has been under great stress. -Please finish...signing the form, sir. -Abe... puede hacer una cuenta regresiva desde tres, por favor? -What's you last name? -I'm going to have to allow fir his low stress efficiency. -Thank you, doctor. Your country thanks you. -Come on, lieutenant colonel! You've been pushing papers so long you forgot how to run! Being in the force is like a day at the fair. Except it's all ups and downs and none of that delicious cotton candy. -What's with the squid? -He passed out during the exam. -Richards...welcome. We're just going over some science stuff. You know? -I'll have some forms for you to sign later, lieutenant colonel. You have to toughen up. We'll be reaching three, pushing four G's on takeoff. -I was... never very good at physics. -You're alright. Takeoff's gonna be really though, though. -Well... let me look at you two. let me look at the spacemen. -He's...fainted again? -That's gonna be annoying. So much easier when things are automated. When things stop working, sometimes. you gotta do it yourself. -You know, I saw this video once where an electric eel killed an alligator. The eel swam up to the gator and kind of just... just taunts him until the gator sinks its teeth right into the eel. It takes you a second to realize the gator isn't in control anymore. The gator starts seizing. Then he finally stops. -Do you have a problem...with me feeding them? They seem to like it. -Just doesn't really seem like you. Not following procedure. Your funeral. -Where's my five dollars allowance? -You got to use your own money or you don't have any allowance. -What money? I ain’t got any money. You think I'd just bring it up? I get five dollars. -Well, I did...but I have to save your five dollars on the dentist. -Oh...good. You're alive. Dumb...but alive. -What's that supposed to mean? -He shows that line all the time but never really hits her. -Do you know what any of those things do? That button you just pushed. What's it do? -Doesn't matter. -Ah...I see. -Ship's gotta run, and I gotta run this ship. -No, you don't. Everything here is automated. What makes you think this ship doesn't fly itself? Why would they leave that to you? Don't push that one! No1 -What are you talking about? -let's see what happens. -Now, isn't that against procedure? I certainly don't wanna find out what happens. -Oh, it's good for you. Risks are good. -Shut up. You don't do any call around here. Just because you realize you're useless, doesn't mean that I am! I fly this ship! -You hit me! You didn't push the button. We're still moving! Aren't we? None of this stuff matters. Everything is pre-programmed. We are moving through space and we'll never stop. We keep going through the same motions over and over again. And we're not changing anything. -What did you do? Where did you hide the sardines? -I sent them into space. You already hit me. -Country smokehouse jerky. Good in the home or on the trail. Country smokehouse. -Can I get everyone's attention, please? Uh... I know that...uh... history books are going to re...recount the...the two-manned mission to the end of the universe...uh... But...we just...we wanna make sure that...that you all know that it's because of your contributions and your hard work, that's what put us there. Alright, so...um...a toast? -Sounds good. -Yeah... Raise your little booze bags. -[all together] To space! -Yeah! -Like that? -Oh. -Oh, it's bad. -Alright, congratulations. -Congratulations. -Congratulations. -Ah, what a job well done. - (Whispering) To space. -MAN: Good job. Really good. -In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans. We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'. There wasn't nigh' as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We looked down the river and we seed the British comin'. And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring. We stood behind our cotton bales and didn't say a thing. We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'. There wasn't nigh' as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise if we didn't fire our muskets 'till we looked 'em in the eyes. We held our fire till we seed their faces well then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em... Well we fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'. There wasn't nigh' as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Yeah they ran through the briers and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em. On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannonballs 'n' powdered his behind, and when we took the powder off, the gator lost its mind We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'. There wasn't nigh' as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Yeah they ran through the briers and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em. On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Hut, hut, three, four Sound off, three. four Hut, hut, three, four Sound off, three. four. -Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane Ain't got time to take a fast train Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home My baby just-a wrote me a letter I don't care how much money I gotta spend -Five...six...seven... eight...nine...ten.... -Announcer: Country smokehouse: a proper man needs a proper meal. Like hickory smokehouse kielbasa. Country smokehouse. -Hey. Hello? Hello? -Announcer: There's no better way to thank you father-in-law for a great hunting trip than a gift basket from Country Smokehouse. Specializing in wild game and domestic products. That's Country Smokehouse. -You been there all day? -I didn't do anything today. -Everyone's allowed to play hooky. Every once in a while. man on T.V.: I don't know. Every time I get out there, something happens to bring me down. I don't care for myself. I've gone there a long time with me. -(man on radio) Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane Ain't got time to take a fast train Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home My baby just-a wrote me a letter. I don't care how much money I gotta spend Got to get back to my baby again. Lonely days are gone, I'ma goin' home My baby just wrote me a letter Well she wrote me a letter 'cause she couldn't live without me no more Listen mister can't you see I go to get back to my baby once more, anyway Give me a ticket for an aeroplane Ain't got time to take a fast train Lonely days are gone, I'ma goin' home My baby just-a wrote me a letter. -Tell me you're gonna fix that pinball machine today. -she wrote me a letter Told me she couldn't live without me no more Listen mister can't you see I gotta get back to my baby once more, anyway Give me a ticket for an aeroplane Ain't got time to take a fast train Lonely days are gone, I'ma goin' home My baby just wrote me a letter. -singsongy: I'm here for you. -Man on TV: What am I talking about? I got the name of it. There's no name on that for me. --Man on TV 2:Rock. --Man on TV 3:Wait -You fix that hunk of junk yet? -Man in TV: ...rob the same family. -Nope. I made this neat necklace. And look... I made us matching bracelets. -Take those off. You look like one of those lame baseball players. -Come on, now. I worked hard on these. They're supposed to relieve pain or something. WHISPERS: I thought I lost you. -Fed your eels today. -There's an automated feeding system. -MAN ON TV: And now, the Country Smokehouse Comedy Hour: Abe Anderson. With the stars Harold Richards and Mary Anderson -Mary! - You're late from work, darling. What happened? - Never mind them, Mary. Where is my supper? - But Abe... - No buts... Mary, we've been married almost ten years now. I thought you knew this. There's one thing a man needs after a long day of work. -Abe... -One thing he's been looking forward to all day. You see, a proper man needs a proper meal when he gets home from work. - Abe... -Now, Mary, If that man doesn't have a hot supper waiting for him when he gets home from work, you tell me what gets him through the day! -Are you finished, Abe? - Yes. I suppose I got my point across. - Wonderful. The bird's in the oven along with the potatoes and the pie. I thought I'd try to keep it warm since you hadn't gotten home yet. You said a proper man deserves a hot supper. -Yeah! -Then I'll go ahead and throw this in the ice chest to cool it off a bit. -Late for work. See ya, sweetheart. -Abe! Your coat, Abe. -Right. Toodles, darling. -Abe... Your hat. -Right. Bye, honey. -Abe? It's Saturday. You don't have to work. -Right... -Seems like the only thing you can remember is breakfast, lunch and dinner. Now I'm going to the grocer's. I'll be back in an hour. -Don't forget the milk! -Speak for yourself! I'll see you soon, sweetheart. -Hey, Abe! -Harold... come look at this. "Memory Linked to Fortune." -So? -So? So?!! So we need to work on our memory. The more we remember, the more we have. - A Mnemonic device. -A Mnemonic device! It's a way of remembering. -Huh? -Like "In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue." -But...oh! hey, I can't swim! -Now, show me these flashcards. -It's a honeybee! -In May of 1941, the war had just begun. The Germans had the bigger ships, they had the biggest guns, the Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea. On their decks were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees. Out of the cold and foggy night, came the British ship The Hood. And every British seaman, he knew and understood, They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea ... Stop those guns as big as steers and the shells as big as trees. We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss We gotta sink the Bismark because the world depends on us. Hit those decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around. When we find the Bismark, we gotta cut her down. -What is tonight's meal? -New York Diner. Burnt and watery. -Yep...just like mom's back home. -What do you got on the agenda for today, Doc? -Oh, mostly working with the bees today. The hive's almost ready for another harvest. -I love that space honey. -Hmm. -Space... -That was close. -Hi captain. -If only. -How's the ship? -Still straight. Still away. How're the bees? -Still busy...still buzzing. We're harvesting tomorrow. -Space honey! Yes! -You know how this thing works? -Yeah. I mean...kinda. It's like a...jet ski. But with space. All that government funding for a giant jet ski. How fast are we going? -Anything less than 330 million and I'm supposed to be concerned. -That's fast. -Faster than my '69 Cuda back home. -You'd think being stuck inside that room with all those buttons and lights and switches you'd have enough. -No. No high score. Demmit! You distracted me. 7 million... 145... thousand, 600. Hey, you're up, doc. -Nah, don't feel like playing tonight. -Forfeit? Victory. -Ah...standard issue. So I suppose Ralph Kramden... Kramden is standard issue as well. -In May of 1941, the war had just begun. -It's harvest day. This year's crop is sure to make us through winter. -Space honey. I'll have to go down to cargo and get some extra bread. -Well, that was easy. Looks like I have this down to a science. What the hell? Harold? Harold?! -Abe, I'm on my way! -Hey Harold, check this out. -God bless it, Abe. -I've never had a beard. -I didn't expect to see you up here. -I don't...like to go... up here. -Wait... if you're here, and I'm here, who is flying the ship?! That was supposed to be funny. -Well, it was funny. I don't understand how you can come up here...every day. -Well, it's not bad. I just look at all the stars and planets. I don't see emptiness. It's like we're the pinball and we're flying past all the bumpers. I think it's beautiful. -Not as pretty as my wife. -Why did you take this mission? -My country asked me to. -That's quite the sacrifice. -There was... a great tax break for my family. I couldn't pass it up. You? -Science asked me to? -What's out there? -I know it's more than anyone expected. There could be other realities out there. A completely different universe. -Careful...you don't wanna tilt. -I am unstoppable right now. Damn. -Damn? 9 million, 989 thousand, 423? You almost maxed out the machine. -Some men need heavy hammers, give me flippers. -So...uh, where is it, doc? -Ah, space honey? -Some men need flippers, give me space honey. Want some? -Oh, no. I've had plenty today. I can...feel my teeth rotting. Do you really get a tax break for being here? -Well, my family did. You didn't? -No. No one said anything about taxes. -You're really here for the science? -Yes. -Damn, doc, how could you've ever left that? -She left me. I wanted to get as far away from there as I could. Time can heal pain. I'm gonna try and train those bees. -What? Like "roll over"? "Sit"? -I think it'd be similar to carrier pigeons. -You're up. -Hey, Harold. I've got some... sort of new special. Don't touch the table! Don't touch the table. -Sorry. -Gotta be free of controversy. Concentrate. -Don't even breathe! -Fingers are cramping. -Stay on target. Why's it still making that noise? -Maybe I broke it. -No. You better not have broke it. -Do you still hear beeping? -Doc! Doc! there's something wrong with the bee...tank. -The bees are dead. -Hey Harold... Harold... -Yeah, buddy? -Are you awake? -Sure. -Yeah, me, too. -Something wrong? -I don't know. -Is it...the bees again? -No, they're actually thriving. I just can't sleep. -I didn't sleep well as a kid. Military bases are always... awake. My mother used to tell me to...think of something that makes you really happy. Really relaxed. Just...focus on that, relax, and you'll slip right into a dream. -WHISPERS: Okay, I'll try it. -'Night, Abe. -That's what's keeping me awake. My wife. And this was...before we were married. We were great, Harold. -What happened after you got married? -I don't know. You know what I mean? Heck, I can't remember everything, but she was making dinner one night, her signature dish, it was chickpeas and rice and... and vegetables or something all cooked in soy sauce and Cayenne pepper. -Sounds...interesting. -It was pretty good. I loved it. I thought it was so cute, how she made it her own. Really the only thing she ever cooked. So, we were cooking and... we were joking around and... she stopped for a second. She turned to me and she asked me if I thought I was funnier than her. -Oh. -Yeah. I mean, of course I was, so of course I told her so. Her face immediately scrunched up. I still don't understand, though. I mean, she can be the smart, pretty one, why can't I be the funny one? -(yawning) I guess you have to pick one. -I know I was the funny one. I guess over the course of our relationship, her sense of humor slowly mirrored mine. That's how I know she loved me. WHISPERS: I wish I could get back to you. -Hey Abe, why are there a bunch of pictures that kind of look like me in your notebook? -It is you. But you're not dead yet. That's a good sign. -Y-yet? -I'll explain later. Can you hand me those...those blueprints? -W-what are you doing? -Trying to figure something out. -Get down from there! -Well, if you hand me the blueprints like I asked you to a moment ago, I can explain. -But Abe...don't! Get down! Don't do this! Get down. It's the green one! -Let go! Let...go! -No! You're gonna kill me or something. There's like 30 sketches of me dead in that book. Explain. -I need those! Get... -No! Not until you explain! -It's complicated. -Why...are you drawing me...dead? -Those are pictures...of when you already died. -What are you talking about? -I keep remembering things so I draw them, or I... I draw them and then remember things, -Doesn't make any sense. Protocol states a procedure for when you go nuts. -It started with the bees. I started drawing them a lot...hundreds of doodles and sketches and then I started drawing them dead. And then they actually died. -The eels? -Yeah, I don't understand most this stuff. It's pieces that I try to put together. -But you had some vision that they killed me? -No, no...they're...they're fragmented memories. The drawings are a catalogue of them...I.... I st...I start doodling and don't even realize it and then I.... I look at a sketch and I'm trying to remember something... -So what will you see next? -It's...it's not like that. I don't... I don't know, I remember. This all happened, will happen, is happening, I'm not sure it's only happening to us, either. -I'm not sure it's only happening to us, either. -So... he was going to kill me. Harold, wait! -This is...this is right, Abe? -I don't know. It's not a science. -You're a scientist. What kind of scientist are you? -Marine biology, but I don't...I don't know if I'm right. -So you were gonna cut wires? On a hunch? Maybe some water gets out of the tank and I...I slip. I don't know. Maybe you don't die. Maybe that's what changes. If you...if you flip past the path I started... drawing all of these... white cracks... against black. -Like the ground. -I have no idea. -Yes. In...in the water. -...what that could mean, but then a couple of days ago, I drew this hat... -How did I fall into the tank? -I have... I have no idea what it means. -If I put my hand in here, -And you think it's enough to kill a man? Huh? Stop! -is that how I die? Come on! Do you remember anything? Come on! I'm not dying.
