(low rumbling) (plane roaring) (creaking) (low rumbling) (gentle guitar music) ? This old guitar ? Is falling apart ? And I don't have the money ? To mend it ? And this whole life ? Is passing me by ? I got no ideas ? How to change it ? If this be the last words ? That I ever write ? Then please ? Don't judge them too harshly (pounding on wall) - [Neighbor] Shut up! What the hell is wrong with you? ? And if this be the last breath ? That I ever take (pounding on wall) Will you please shut up? (shattering) Please! (phone rings) (phone rings) - [Male Caller] Hey, bud, how's the motel? - [Guitarist] Pretty shitty. - [Male Caller] (chuckles) Yeah, well, you know, if, if you don't walk out on the next one, we'll put you up in the Four Seasons. How's that? So you sent them the measurements, right? For the costumes? - [Guitarist] Doug, I don't think I can do this. - [Doug] Dude, can you afford not to? Honestly? Honestly. Listen, uh, I'm just tryin' to be honest with you here. You're lucky to be getting this call at all, you know? I mean, you, look, you're a hell of an artist and all, and you know that. The reality is, you're not good with people. You're just not a people person. And, and that's okay, that's fine. I'm just saying, with your reputation and all, if you don't show up for this one, this might be the last call you get. - [Guitarist] (sighs) I'll need a new guitar. (gentle guitar music) (alarm buzzes) - [Neighbor] Shut up, what the hell, man? Turn it off! (pounding on wall) Are you kidding? (pounding on wall) Are you kidding? ? Some humans ain't human ? Some people ain't kind ? You open up their hearts ? Here's what you'll find ? Some humans ain't human ? Though they walk like we do ? They live and they breathe ? Just to turn your screw ? You might go to church ? And sit down in a pew ? Those humans who ain't human ? Could be sittin' right next to you ? They talk about your family ? They talk about your clothes (soulful humming) - Hey. Joni. (soulful humming) - Elliott. (soulful folk music) - [Pilot] Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have been, uh, ordered to land the aircraft, uh. If you're up, please return to your seat. We need everyone seated with their seat belts fastened. We'll have more information as we get it, but, for now, just remain in your seats, seat belts fastened. We're returning to Los Angeles. (people shouting and chattering) - [News Reporter] As one plane hit the World Trade Center, then, some time later, another plane hit the other tower of the World Trade Center in what looks to be a coordinated attack on New York. We're going to go back, to go live now, to the street where (speaker cut off). - [PA Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. At this time, for your safety, airport security and the LAPD request that you exit the airport if not authorized personnel. This airport is being evacuated. - [Operator] All circuits are busy now. Please try your call again. - [PA Announcer] Please use the exits in a calm, orderly manner. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Did you get your bag? - [PA Announcer] Exit the airport immediately as instructed by the LAPD. (droning ambient music) (siren wails) (droning ambient music) - [Joni] Hey, Elliott! (droning ambient music) - All right, where we goin'? - Topanga Canyon. Um, I can show you once we get up that way. Where do you need to go? - Um. I don't know. Uh, I was just passin' through town. - Okay, well come up to Scottie's place. It's my mom's friend. It's where I've been stayin'. - Uh. - Is that okay? - Yeah. Um, yeah, sorry. It's a lot. (siren wails) - Jesus Christ, the whole goddamned world is blowin' up. - Do you know how much the fare is gonna be, sir? Do you have cash on you? - Oh, uh. - Um. You know what, don't worry about it. - What's that? - Don't worry about the fare. - Oh my gosh, thank you so much. - We have enough to worry about right now. - [Reporter Voiceover] At least two hijacked planes were headed to Los Angeles. - [Joni] It's all right. - [Elliott] Um, Elliott. - [Reporter Voiceover] The police ask (speaker fades out). This is not open for general information. (speaker cuts out) for family who have may have lost someone on one of the flights. - So is there anybody you need to call? - Um, no, ma'am. - Not your mom? Not your family? anybody? - No, I'm good. (shouting on TV) - You guys were supposed to be there right now. - I still need to be there. (shouting on TV) - [Older Woman] Honey? - [Operator] We're sorry. Due to heavy calling-- - I can't get through. - Yeah, no. It's okay, honey, because your mom's gonna be okay. She's okay. - Okay. - the nurse is with her, right? - Yeah. I shouldn't have left her. I knew I shouldn't have come. - Come here. - Did they say anything about flights starting up again? - No. No. - I can't just wait here. I have to figure out something, how to get back. - Come on. Come on, we got this. Oh, your mama would love this. (chuckling) Hello, baby. She's been cross-country nine or 10 times by now. - [Joni] This is your old tour van, Scottie? - [Scottie] Yes, it is, and she's a very reliable girl sometimes. Watch your, watch your head here. This is like a menace. Uh, here's your sound system, and there are some great tunes in the back. This is a CB. It does not work, it never did. - [Joni] What's all this stuff back here? - Oh, that's mostly Jeff's gear. He said he was gonna come get it last spring, but there it sits. Okay, come on, baby. (engine grinds) Come on. - Are you sure you're not gonna need the van? - Oh, Joni, do I look like I'm hittin' the road anytime soon? Come on. Third time's the charm. You with me? (engine rumbles) Yes! (laughs) We are in business. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, we had everybody we met on the road when we touring, and we had 'em sign it. - Ah, you're both musicians. - Well Scottie is, not me. - Oh hush, she has the voice of an angel. Excuse me, baby. I've been givin' it some thought, and I think if you both take turns driving, you can make it in three or four days. - What's that? - Well you need to get back east, right? - Well, I mean, yeah, but-- - So, here's your ride. Come on, I told you, Jeff needs his gear that's in here, right? You'll be doin' him a favor, baby. - What do you think? (siren wails) - You guys really wanna get back on a plane right now? - I really can't afford to wait around here. Can you? (solemn instrumental music) - [Woman On Radio] I was running from the dust and I grabbed onto something, and I didn't, I didn't realize at first that it was a hand, and we ran and we ducked behind this car, and that's when I saw her face. I didn't, I didn't know her, but I found out it was Julie. She was a total stranger. And I wouldn't have made it out without her. (static hisses) - [Reporter Voiceover] People are, for the most part, largely calm, largely respectful of each other. No doubt, many have (speaker fades out). - It's weird, the farther we get out from the city, the less real it all feels. - It still feels pretty real to me. - Well, so, why did you say you were going out to New York again? - Uh, I got a gig. - Like a band? - Yeah. Hairpin Triggers. - You're in the Hairpin Triggers? That's amazing. - It's just for their tour. - Still, that's huge. I mean, I haven't heard their music yet, but I hear their name all the time. - Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be there by now, so we'll see. So, you're, uh, goin' to visit your mom? - Uh, no, I live there with my mom in New York. - [Elliott] Oh yeah? - Yeah, I just came out to LA for a wedding for a friend. (engine squeals) - [Elliott] Shit. - [Joni] Oh my God. - I got it God damn it. - Dude I'm just trying to help. Do you know anything about cars? - Of course I do. I just don't know much about vans. (sighs) It's definitely overheating. - [Joni] Yeah, Scottie said that we should take it slow. - We can slow down. We'll have to get off the main roads. Be two-lane highways from here on out. (sighs) - [Joni] This is gonna take forever. - Yeah. (sedate instrumental music) (phone buzzes) (sedate instrumental music) (train whistle blares) (urine splatters) (sedate instrumental music) - [George W. Bush Voiceover] Good evening. Today, our fellow citizens came under attack in airplanes or in their offices. Secretaries, businessmen and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. And we responded with the best of America, with the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in anyway they could. This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. None of us will ever forget this day. Yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world. Good night, and God bless America. (crickets chirp) (engine rumbles) - Hey. - Mornin'. - Where are we? - [Joni] Arizona, I think. - Still? - [Joni] Yeah, I think so. You wanna find some coffee? - Sure. Hey, why were we stopped? - I don't know, I, I pulled over for a minute, but I think I fell asleep for the night. - Wait. So we haven't moved at all? - You fell asleep first. - Yeah, but you were drivin'! - Look, I wanna get back to, okay? I fell asleep, I'm sorry. - I have people waiting on me! - You have people waiting on you? Look, my mom is waiting on me, okay? I'm not going back for some shitty band. - Pull over, I wanna drive. (engine rumbles) I'm flyin' back. - What? - We'll find an airport, and wait til they start flyin' again. - Why, because I called your band shitty? - I'm not kiddin'. - That's fine, just leave me. - I don't even know you. (droning instrumental music) (dog barks) (traffic hums) ? Bright eyes ? And sweet smile ? For with you ? You are taking ? The sunshine ? That brightened ? My path for a while ? Come and sit by my side ? If you love me ? Do not hasten ? To bid me adieu ? Just remember ? That Red River Valley ? And the cowboy ? That loved you so true ? When you think ? Of this valley ?

Tonight I lay on the cold, cold ground ? Beside that Black Jack David ? Beside that Black Jack David ? Yep Townes Van Zandt. - Oh yeah! - Willie Nelson, Red-Headed Stranger. Leadbelly. She's got some gold in here. - She does indeed. Yeah, Scottie's the best with that stuff. She just looks all over the place for, like, the best old folk songs she can find. Live recordings and all these, like, unreleased things. She finds everything. Been doin' it for years. - That's pretty great. - Yeah. Do the Hairpin Triggers play folk? - Not even close. - Sorry I called them shitty earlier. I honestly haven't even heard any of their songs. - It's all right. Actually are kind of shitty. - I just knew their costumes were shitty. (chuckles) - Enough of that. (singing in foreign language) I would've sworn there'd be a bathroom out here. - [Joni] You sure pee a lot. - I drink a lot of water. - [Joni] Eh, just sayin'. ? If you don't know Spanish ? You can still sing it ? Elysian Park is beautiful ? Elysian Park is my kind of park ? The air is free, my friends ? We don't want buildings in the park ? We want the green grass ? The park is yours and mine (singing in foreign language) (Joni humming) (TV reporter speaking in foreign language) (sliding guitar music) (TV reporter speaking in foreign language) - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. (TV reporter speaking in foreign language) - [Joni] Anything new on there? - No. (TV reporter speaking in foreign language) (traffic hums) - You sit there. - Nice fort you got here. - It's not a fort, it's a teepee. - Oh. Sorry. Uh, hey, you, uh, think I can get my hat back? - Where's your wife? - Uh, that, that's not my wife. - Why not? - I don't know. - [Operator] We're sorry, due to heavy volume (speaker cut off). - Miss. - Hi. - Excuse me, Miss. You, you gave me an extra dollar. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah, um, is, uh, everything okay? - Yeah. Ah, minute. Here, for you. - Oh, I can't-- - No! Please, take it, take it, from one American to another, huh, okay? - Thank you. - Yeah, you are very welcome. Safe travels, huh? - Thank you. - Okay. Bye. - What are you workin' on there? - It's one of my fire trucks. - Oh yeah? Who's it for? - For all the people. - What people? - For all those people who were in the fire. (Spanish guitar music) - [Joni] You look good without your hat. - Thanks. I've had it on pretty much every day since I got it. Hear anything? - From my mom? No, I haven't been able to get through yet. (gentle Spanish guitar music) It's really tough, you know? She's always been the really strong one in the family, and I guess, right now, I'm just trying to take care of her. But I don't even. I feel selfish to complain about it. (gentle guitar music) (van rattles and squeaks) - [Elliott] I can't believe I gave that kid my hat. ? Swing low ? Sweet chariot ? Comin' for to carry ? Me home - Can you hear me? No, I'm fine, I'm fine. No, I'm drivin'. I'm in this shitty van with this girl. It's a long story. ? Comin' for to carry ? Me home ? If you get there ? Before I do Grow up, Doug, I'm not gonna answer that. Yeah. Doug. Yes, she's cute. Just call the number, okay? I'll get hold of you in a couple days. ? Comin' for to carry ? Me home (clapping) - Really has a way of takin' your mind off things, don't it? - Yeah, it sure does. Hey, Elliott, this is Fargo. - Pleasure. - Hey, Elliott. - Uh, don't happen to know when the shop opens up, do ya? - Uh, those folks are long gone. - Oh really? - Yeah. How bad is it? - Uh, it's been overheatin' pretty often. - Well, it's a hike, but you could take it out to Whitey's place. - Whitey? - This crazy cat who lives out in the dunes. He can fix damn near anything, but he can't pull himself out of the dunes. Can't fix stupid, I guess. (Elliott chuckles) - I guess not. Well. - [Joni] Oh my gosh, that was amazing. Where's the seat belt? - What's that? - Singing with him like that. You must get that all the time. - It's kinda not like that anymore. - Why not? - I don't know. I guess that's the way it started out. At least, all the stories I heard about folk music. But, ever since I been travelin', I just kinda haven't experienced it. People just seem too cool or somethin', I guess. - Well we should bring it back. - Bring what back? - Bring back the folk. - Yeah, maybe so. There we go. - What are you doing? - Well, my pop used to have this old Suburban, and every time it'd overheat. - Oh my gosh. - We would, uh, kick the heat on, and let some of the heat off the motor. It's not gonna fix it, but it might get us to Whitey's. - The adventure continues. - Yep. ? Freight train ? Freight train ? Runs so fast ? Freight train ? Freight train ? Runs so fast ? Please don't tell ? What train I'm on ? They won't know ? What route I'm gone - [Joni] Bring back the folk! ? When I'm dead ? And in my grave ? No more good times ? Here I crave ? Place the stones ? At my head and feet - [Elliott] Stick close. - Can't park there. Ya gotta take it on back to the Ranger station. - Uh, Whitey? - Come again? - Um, we're lookin' for Whitey. - The name's Dale. - Oh, Dale, sorry, we're lookin' for Whitey's trailer. We must have the wrong one. - Whitey! Hey, Whitey, you out there? Pagin' Whitey, party of one! Wipe your shoes off. Come on in. Like I said, the name's Dale, but them sons of bitches in town like to call me Whitey for some reason. - [Joni] It's really beautiful out here, Dale. - Yeah, well I don't get a lot of visitors. It is a bit bedraggled. Got a flashlight. Solar, too. I mean, if you need it. - Thank you. I, I, I don't know that you need it, but, uh, well, you probably don't, what with a lantern and all, huh? - Thank you. - Well, I got some whiskey around here somewhere. - Sir? - Where'd I put that goddamn bottle? I don't, uh, drink much myself, except on, uh, special occasions, which I guess that's what this is. - Dale, we're havin' some trouble with our van. - Yeah, we ran into Fargo in town. He said that maybe you'd be able to take a look at it for us. - Fargo? You mean that damn bastard's still around, huh? - Yeah. Um, do you think you could take a look at it? - What do you think I'm doin' over here, lady? Just tryin' to find my goddamn headlamp. Now come on, let's go, time's wastin'. Let's go see what's goin' on up here. Oh, it's a 350. I seen them before. - [Elliott] Can I give ya a hand? - I got it, goddamn it. Go ahead and give it a turn there, huh, cowboy? - All right. (engine rumbles) - Well, shoot. It's been overheatin', ain't it? - Yeah. We've been drivin' with the heater on. - Well that's smart. - Yeah. It's makin' this weird noise, too. - What noise? Make the noise for me. - Um. Make it like? - Make the goddamn noise! - Uh, it's, it was like (squeals). - Huh. I don't know that noise. Uh, okay, you can shut it down now there, partner. - [Elliott] All right. - [Joni] What do you think? - Well, I got me some ideas, uh, but I, I can't do much with it in this light. Can you leave it here with me? - I don't know. Um. Do you think we can definitely not drive it how it is? - Oh, I wouldn't. You'd be riskin' bigger problems down the road. You don't wanna melt them innards. That's where all the good stuff is. - Right. - Anyways, I gotta go pump me some water. We gotta try and cool this steamer off. - You need a hand? (Dale chuckles) - Hey, Dale. Um, well we really don't have a lot of money. - Well, I tell ya what, Missy, you two go have a seat inside, and, when I get back, we'll have ourselves a little barter. How's that grab ya? - That sounds great. - All right. - Do you see a TV in here? - Uh uh, why? - I was just, I was just wondering if he knows about all that's going on. - I don't. - Okay, I watered it. We'll just let it set in there. I'll take a look at it at first light. As the rooster crows. I, uh, I don't have a rooster. It's way too hard for 'em out here. - Hey, Dale, has anybody been by here in the last day or so? - Buddy, I ain't had anybody stop by here in the last year or so. 'Cept them Rangers and, uh, well I know all those bums. - Uh, have you been to town much? - Well I try not to. I used to go into Rick's to play a little dominoes, but I haven't been there in ages. Okay. I got it. Listen, I got an idea. All right? Uh, I'm not much of a chef, but, uh, well I, I sure can help you with that ride of yours. How's about, in return, y'all fix me a meal? - Yeah, sure. - We can handle that. - Great! 'cause I get so tired of the same damn recipes. I mean, I suppose I could, uh, learn some new ones, but, uh, well, you know. Old dogs. So, uh, where ya headed anyways? - Uh, New York. - Is that right? All the way to New York, huh? What's the special occasion? - Well, Dale, um-- - We're musicians. - Musicians, you say? - Yeah, mm hmm. We're headed there for a gig. - A gig. Well that's terrific. Well, I can sure get you there in a couple of days, no problemo. Wow. So I have myself, uh, two chefs who can also play a little dinner music. I must've hit the hillbilly jackpot! - Um, yeah, you know, uh, actually, Joni can play you one right now. - Oh, I don't know, do you? - Yeah, grab a guitar. I can handle this. Play this fine man one of your songs, would ya? - One of mine? - [Elliott] Yeah. Bring back the folk. - [Dale] Wait. Be careful. There's a rabid raccoon in the neighborhood. (sparkler fizzes) (humming) ? I've been livin' in New York ? For seven years ? Now I'm not ? Winters cold and long ? Summers hot ? Spendin' all my days ? Just keepin' what I got ? Tryin' to write the words ? To a song ? And everybody else ? Is gettin' on ? Everybody else (humming) ? Traveled over the ocean ? I seen sign from many sights ? I've seen strong men crawl ? And babies rise ? Ridden on the last train ? Out to Brooklyn late at night ? Snuck in with the water ? On my feet ? And everybody else ? Was fast asleep ? Everybody else (humming) - [Elliott] Perfect timing. Dinner's ready. Thank you. So, uh, did you come out here after the war, Dale? - Yeah. I had to get away from all them protests and whatnot. You see, uh, comin' home wasn't like after WW Deuce. All the fanfare and ticker tape and, and such. - Right. - That's for damn sure. But not to, not to get all sappy and such, but, uh, well, it is nice to have some drinkin' buddies here for a change. And, uh, musicians to boot. - It's nice for us, too, Dale. - Power of music, my friends. Power of music. I remember a story about, uh, Pete Seeger from way back when. It was right after his, you know, big trip to North Vietnam and all that. Uh. He used to put on these shows. He'd have the whole audience sing along. You know about that old shtick. - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - 'Course you do. Well he was finishin' up one of them shows, and, uh, this young kid comes up out of the crowd, onto the stage, and when he look at, uh, Seeger all serious like, and, and he says to him, uh, Mr. Seeger, sir, I came here tonight to kill you. Son of a beast. Damn fool. No, no, no, I, I got it. I'm the host, you stay put. So, Seeger looks at him. And, and he says, uh, says, came here to kill me? And, and the kid looks him right dead in the eye and says, but don't worry, Petey, I ain't gonna kill ya, I ain't gonna kill ya. And instead he, uh, he shakes his hand and, and thanks him, and then walks off into the night without another word. I mean, that kid sat there all night long, listenin' to them songs, and watchin' them folks sing along, and what does he decide to do? Why, he decides, instead of killin' Seeger, that he's gonna shake his goddamn hand instead. Power of music. The power of music. Well. It would appear that I am sufficiently drunk. Take my truck. You can get yourself a room in town. Dirt cheap. (pulsing instrumental music) (Joni groans) - Maybe we should get another drink first? (neighbors shouting) - Okay. - [Reporter On TV] There's discussion already in Washington of perhaps giving our government, or the intelligence agencies, more power than they've previously had, perhaps even broadening the scope of policing. (balls click) To Dale. - To Dale. You can't cheers and not drink. It's bad luck. (chuckles) - I saw a payphone back there. - Oh yeah? Thank you. Well, it's probably too late to call right now. Her nurse is taking care of her for the weekend for me, and I'm just hopin' that she's gonna stay. - So nobody else to help? - I mean, I have a sister, but she's just not around very much. - What's she doin' that's so important? - I don't know. We don't talk very much anymore. - It seems like a lot of responsibility for one person. - Yeah. (laughing) - Yay! - Everyone copes with it differently, you know? My sister's off livin' her life in the world, and I'm takin' care of my mom, and, when I get a chance, I go into the back bedroom and play a little guitar. - That doesn't surprise me. - Why is that? - 'Cause you're very good. - I don't know about all of that, but thank you. - I'm serious. You're too good to be playin' in the back. - You should be talkin'. - [Elliott] Me? - You said yourself that you thought the band is shitty. - Yeah, but I need a job. - Feels like with all this stuff goin' on that everyone's maybe examining their lives a little bit right now. - All I'm examining is the bottom of this glass right now. - Next round's on me. - Yes, it is. A little funny. - No, it's not. - Kind of funny. I think we're that way. - [Fargo] Hey, hey. - [Joni] Fargo! - You two need a lift? - [Joni] Yeah! - Ah, we're just up the way. We can walk, it's no big deal. - No, we would love a ride. - All right. - [Joni] What's that song? Oh my gosh, turn it up, I love this. ? Fun on the bayou I love it! ? Jambalaya and a crawfish pie ? And a file gumbo - Ride might be best, bro. ? 'Cause tonight I'm gonna see ? My ma cher amio - Yeah, you might be right. ? Jar and be gayo ? Son of a gun ? Well have big fun ? On the bayou - Oh, you got a live one there, brother. - Yes, sir. - How long have y'all been married? - (chuckles) We're not married. - Oh? Well brother if you don't marry that girl, I will. (chuckles) ? And be gayo ? Son of a gun ? We'll have big fun ? On the bayou - Home sweet home. - Here ya go. I'm so thirsty. You want some water? - Why not? (neighbors laughing) (gentle guitar strumming) Listening. ? This old guitar ? Is fallin' apart ? I ain't got money ? To mend it (muffled singing) ? If this be the last word ? That I ever write ? Then please don't judge me ? Too harshly ? And if this be the last breath ? That I ever take ? I hope ? You will remember ? Me fondly ? What could I do ? What could I say - [Joni] That's so beautiful. Wait, don't put it away, keep playin'. Is it one of yours? - Yeah. It's nothing. - It's not nothing. It's really pretty. - Thanks. - Will you keep playin' a little more? - You don't wanna hear me play. - Yes, I do. - Drunk. - Come on, just a little more? - What do you care? - I care. Um. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Smooth, Elliott. - Oh, come on. It's disgusting down there. - It's fine. - [Joni] No. Come on, the carpet is so gross. Get up here. (droning instrumental music) - [Elliott] It's my birthday tomorrow. - Really? Well, happy birthday. (droning instrumental music) (birds tweet) Oh, hey. - Sorry. Sorry. Uh. - It's all right. - {Elliott] Uh. Just. - [Joni] Thank you. - [Elliott] Breakfast was included with the room, so I'll. Anyway. I'll. (gentle instrumental music) - [Joni] Hi, can we get a coffee, please? - Okay, just a regular coffee? - Yeah, that'd be great. - To go? - [Joni] To go, please, thank you. - Do you need cream with this? - [Joni] Uh, no thank you. Thanks so much. - Thank you. (gentle guitar music) - [Joni] Got this for you. - Well, uh, thank you kindly, Missy. Okay, so listen, uh, this is, uh, this is just a quick fix. Now you gotta keep a really close eye on that gauge. If it starts to overheat, why, you need to pull over and give it a rest. - All right. - We can do that. - Now you can try turning the heat on to see if that helps, but if that needle goes to the red, why, you need to stop or you're gonna melt it. - All right. - Okay. - Yeah, thank you so much for doin' all this for us, Dale. - You're welcome. That's a damn fine cup of coffee. - Hmm, yeah, there's a lot of fine things in town there. - Yeah, as a matter of fact, we, uh, stumbled into Rick's last night. I think your dominoes game is missin' ya a little bit. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. (fighter jets pass overhead) - One too many whiskies last night, amigo? Anyways, I, um, (sighs). You know, I, uh, how can I say it? Oh, nothin'. It's fine, it's fine. - You need somethin', Dale? - Well, it, it's that damn tarp. - What, you need help? - Hell no, I don't need no goddamn help! It's just that, well, it's hard to get it all, uh, tied down alone. - Well why don't we have a look? - Yeah, come on, let's go. - Well, uh. Well okay. (droning instrumental music) (phone rings) (droning instrumental music) - [Reporter] Coming together as a nation as perhaps we never have. - Hey, it's me. Um, I'm so happy I got through. We're driving. I'm with this guy, and it's, um, it's a long story, but I'm totally safe. It's gonna be a few days, probably, or a couple days, I don't know til we're there. We're still a ways out. Um, Rita, tell Mom that I love her, please. I'm gonna get back as soon as I can. Thank you so much for covering for me. I, I didn't know this was all. (beeping) - [Woman] Joni. Joni, are you there? - [Reporter] Major Internet service providers are being contacted by the FBI. - Hello, how are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. Ah, two for a dollar, eh? This your place? - Yes, it is. - [Elliott] Ah, it's really nice here. - Where you from? - [Elliott] Well, um, a ways from here. - Away from here? - Yes, ma'am. - Well we're glad to have ya in Texas. - [Elliott] Oh, thank you. - Is Rita there? - [Woman] Rita went home. I'm here now. - Kelly, did she tell you what she needs? Mom needs to take the blue pills in the morning with food-- - Yeah, yeah. She told me. Mom's okay. I, I mean, she's confused, but she's okay, Joni. Just get back safe, okay? - Okay, tell Mom that I'm gonna be back, I love her. I'll talk to you later. - [Elliott] Are you all right there, partner? - [Joni] Yeah, I'm fine. - [Elliott] Hey, you wanna play one? - [Joni] No, not, not right now. - [Reporter On Radio] In history, sports will be a footnote of secondary importance perhaps. (speaker fades out) When we peek back at these days, but still (speaker fades out) reasons of public safety (speaker fades out) closures. So you don't go anywhere you don't absolutely need to go. Again, Major League baseball has canceled its games tonight. The first time a whole slate of games have been canceled since D-Day in 1944. The cancellations include, of course, the White Sox and Yankees, which was scheduled for the Bronx tonight. Other sports, including NASCAR, has canceled qualifying rounds for this weekend's race. Minor League baseball playoff games have been canceled indefinitely. The PGA has canceled its tour dates. Thoroughbred racing have all been canceled. Essentially, arenas or venues where large amounts of people typically gather have been closed for safety. (guitar picking) - Um. Do you know Hello Stranger? - [Elliott] How's that go? ? Hello, stranger ? Put your lovin' hand in mine Yeah! ? Hello, stranger ? Put your lovin' hand in mine ? Hello, stranger ? Put your lovin' hand in mine ? You are a stranger ? But you're a pal of mine ? Get up, rounder ? Get up, rounder ? Workin' man lay down ? Get up, rounder ? Let a workin' man lay down ? You are a rounder ? You're all out and down - [Reporter Voiceover] Businesses remain closed with workers staying home today, taking their cue, perhaps, from Wall Street, which remains closed. World Trade Center (speaker fades out) most horrible (speaker fades out) for this country. - [Joni] Hey, I think it's my turn for gas next, yeah? - [Elliott] Yeah, this thing really eats it up. - I was just wondering, I, I'm a little low on cash right now. Is it all right if, um, you spot me? - Really? I was actually about to ask you the same thing. - Wait, seriously? - Yeah. I'll be fine when I get to New York, but I'm kinda busted right now. - Great, now we're gonna have to stop again in 10 minutes. - Don't worry about me. - [Joni] Mm hmm. You should really get that checked out! You're not a kid anymore. - [Kid] Oh God, I'm so hungry. - [Woman In Hat] Wait. Look. - [Woman] What? - Let's go. Come on! - Hey! - [Woman In Hat] Hi, need some help? - [Joni] Yeah, that'd be great. - [Blonde Woman] Moose hat! - What's all this? - [Women] Happy birthday! - [Joni] Make a wish. - You crazy. - Woo! - Woo! - Elliott, so this is Bianca and Emily. Elliott. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Like your hat. (chuckling) - [Joni] And they're on their way from San Francisco to Tennessee? - Tennessee, right. - Well, to be fair, it's also Virginia. - Yeah, technically, it's both. - Do you guys want some of this? - We're going to my folks' place in Bristol. - Yeah, it's right on the border. It's half in Tennessee and half in Virginia. - So the girls need a ride, and they also offered to pay for gas. - Okay. There it is. - Hairpin triggers, huh? - [Elliott] Yeah. - What, are those all your costumes? (gentle guitar music) - Man, your birthday is never gonna be the same, huh? - Guess not. - Stupid terrorists. - [Elliott] So San Fran, huh? - Oh, don't call it San Fran. - You're such a freak. - You love it. - I love it. - How long have you two been together? - [Emily] A little over three years? - About, yeah. Three. - [Joni] Ah, that's a long time. - Yeah, it takes a national tragedy for Bianca to introduce me to her family. - Shut up. - I'm just joking, babe, you know that. Bianca's gonna come out to her family. - Oh, they don't know? - It should be interesting to say the least. Plus, I wanna see my cousin. He's in the Reserves, and my dad keeps saying he's gonna get called up and stuff like that. - And stuff like that. (chuckling) - Wait, so you guys hitched all the way here? - Yeah. - Yeah! It's been cool. Like, total strangers are so nice. It's kind of amazing. - Yeah. It's like everyone's kind of looking out for each other, you know? Wait, I almost forgot. All right, so I took Polaroids of everyone we met. With the moose hat? - [Bianca] Oh, this one. - He looked at me. (gentle guitar music) ? Layin' with the one I love ? Lookin' at the moon above ? Bein' where we really ? Want to be ? The autumn winds for now ? Are still - You okay? Your reflexes need some work. - Here, try again. - There we go! - You're an idiot! - [Joni] I love you guys. (laughing) ? And shine on me (frogs croaking) - [George W. Bush Voiceover] I want you all to know that America today is on bended knee in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, for the workers who work here. I can hear you! (cheering) I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. (cheering) - [Crowd Voiceover] USA! USA! (solemn instrumental music) - Okay. No, not here, not here, not here. - Hey. - Hey. - Mind if I borrow your restroom? - [Bianca] Sure. - [Man] That was San Francisco. - [Woman] Hey, hot off the presses. - Oh thank you so much. - Can't you let go on the road with an empty stomach. (chuckling) - So, so I understand y'all headed to New York. - Yes, sir. - Mm hmm. - I can only imagine what it's like there. I mean, even this city feels different. - It does? - Oh yeah. That whole Virginia versus Tennessee thing seems to be gone. It, it feels more united. Stuff like that. - Oh, that was never such a big deal. Everybody have everything you need? There's lots more, right, Mike? - Oh, lots more. - [Elliott] This is plenty, thank you. - [Joni] Thanks. - Jimmy, switch seats with your cousin, will you? I want to sit next to my daughter. - Is something wrong with the food? - Everything's fine, dear. (celery crunches) - Um, have you heard anything? - Yeah, they say on the news we're gonna bomb the shit out of those guys. - Jimmy, please. I ain't sayin' we shouldn't retaliate, I'm just askin' you to watch your language. - We don't have to get into it. - I'm impressed with Bush. I'm glad we've got a strong leader in office right now. - I'm sure our guests would rather not discuss politics right now. - Darlin', all I'm sayin' is the people who did this need to be held responsible. - Dad, come on. - And I think it's important that we have somebody in office who vowed to do that. - That's right. - Don't you think we should get all the information first? - Well, here's what I think, young lady. - We don't have to get into it. I want to hear all about you. We're so happy that you came back home. We finally get to meet your roommate. - Mom, Daddy, actually, um, I came back to tell you guys something. - Is everything okay, baby? - Mom, everything's fine. - Don't talk to your mother like that. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um, on Tuesday morning, our friend Angel called us and told us to turn on the TV, so we did, and that morning, we just sat there, and we watched. For hours. Together, trying to make sense of it all. (sighs) I'm sorry. I am. I mean, once we figured out that you were okay, and everyone that we knew was okay, I just wanted to sit there with her, you know? And just be there with her. And I couldn't imagine not having her right there by my side. For so long, I didn't have anybody but her. And it was so hard to be out there by myself. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Emily is my girlfriend, Dad. - I'm sorry? - And I, and I love her with everything that I am. I don't know how to explain it. There's so many-- - No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Are you serious, Bianca? - [Mother] Let's just hang on a second. - No, no, with, with, with everything that is goin' on right now, this is what you decide to do? - It's not a decision. - I am talkin' to my daughter, young lady! - Everybody take a breath. Take a breath, okay? We have guests here. - She's happy. - Excuse me? - They're happy together. - Who are you to-- - Mike, please. - What about everything they have to face? Hmm? - I guess they'll face it. - What about what we've been through, what we deal with? Looks every goddamn place we go. People spittin' in my face. - I think we should, we should go. - You should definitely go. - I apologize, I don't mean any disrespect. It's just, all these people who've just died. Some have lost their whole families, sir. Yours is right here. Excuse me. (solemn instrumental music) - [Emily] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh my God! It's yours. (sedate instrumental music) - Hey, I bet there's a bunch of bears and stuff like that up here. - Stuff like that? (chuckles) - What a trip. - Yeah, what a trip. Hey, um, did you get any sleep last night? - [Joni] No. How much longer, you think, til we get there? - Uh, seven or eight hours. If the van holds up on these hills anyway. - I can't really imagine driving through the night again. And, honestly, I don't feel like I'm ready yet to be back and deal with everything. - Well, we can split it up. - Really? Don't you have to get back to the band? - I don't think anybody in New York's too worried about the hairpin Triggers right now. Honestly, neither am I. (sliding guitar music) ? Oh, Shenandoah ? I long to see you ? Away ? You rollin' river ? Oh, Shenandoah ? I long to see you ? Away ? I'm bound away ? 'Cross the wide ? Missouri ? Oh, Shenandoah ? I love your daughter ? Away ? You rolling river ? Oh, Shenandoah ? I'd cross your waters ? Away ? I'm bound away ? 'Cross the wide ? Missouri - [Man] Welcome to the Mountain. - Ah, thank you so much. - My friends are your friends. Enjoy yourself. Stay as long as you need to. - [Joni] Thank you. (people chattering) - [Man In Middle] Last rental car on the whole lot. - That's unbelievable, man. - Got real lucky. - So how do you pronounce it? Because I heard Appalachia and Appalachah. - Well. - Stopped in the first place I saw. Gave blood. What else could I do? - [Man] That's really, that's really sweet of you. - There's so many people here. - Sure are. (people laughing and chattering) - [Joni] You know what I'm thinkin'? - What's that? - We gotta bring back the folk. What do you think? What song? - Um. - What have ya got? - All right, somethin', how 'bout, uh, how 'bout a singalong? - [Crowd] Yeah! (clapping) - Yeah, I want you to sing along. Just repeat every line. That way you never get one wrong. ? You gotta walk ? You gotta walk ? That lonesome valley ? That lonesome valley ? You gotta walk ? You gotta walk ? It by yourself ? It by yourself ? Nobody here ?

Yeah, she's all right. Little bit of a pain in the ass, but I don't mind. You bet. Catch ya later. Come on in front. (percussive instrumental music) (moves into gentle instrumental music) - [Reporter Voiceover] In a sign of unprecedented solidarity with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the entirety of Europe, has agreed to take a moment of silence today. Millions of people across many nations, all standing in support of America, and in honor of those of who have lost their lives. So, please now, we ask that you take such a moment of silence along with us. (droning instrumental music) - You all right? (van rumbles) - Yeah, all right. - This is you. - Yeah. - It's nice. - Thanks. Feels strange to be back. - You'll be okay. - Thanks. - Come here. (soft instrumental music) You sure you don't want me to take the van? - Oh no, they're comin' to get it. Did you wanna use the bathroom? I'm sure you have to pee. - I'm good. - Right. - Um, here. - [Joni] What's this? - Uh, a song I've been workin' on. Thought maybe you could help me out with it. - Really? - Really. You're great. Keep goin'. - Thanks. Oh. - How could I forget? Well, she made it. - [Joni] Of course she made it. We're all gonna make it. Mom? (rousing instrumental music) (train whooshes) (soft instrumental music) (recorder clicks) - [Elliott] Good to go? (Joni chuckling) - [Joni] Okay. - [Elliott] All right. ? This old guitar ?

Don't judge them to harshly ? If this be the last breath ? I ever take ? I hope ? You will remember ? Me fondly ? It was early September ? When we hit the ground ? And we drove through the waters ?

Where the new soldiers played ? And they're all too young ? But they mean what they say ? So we just ? Kept movin' ? And I wish I had known you ? When the world was still young ? Before religion so reckless ? Tried to shoot out the sun ? And they say we'll be standin' ? When the last war is won ? But will we ? Be worthy ? Oh ? Ooh ? Ooh ? If you were my future ? I'd hold you to my coat ? And fold you into it ? And never let go ? And walk through this land ? With our message of hope ? Just laughin' ? And singin' ? Ooh ? Ooh ? Ooh ?
