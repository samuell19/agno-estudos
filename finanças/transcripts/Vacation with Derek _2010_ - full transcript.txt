I would like my massage at 14:00 hours. - Back massage? - I'm thinkin' foot massage. Both of them! Edwin. EDWIN! Could you mix me up some more iced tea? From scratch this time? - Lemon? - Obviously. Lizzy! Lunch. - But I just made you breakfast! - And it was excellent. Could I have a snack while I'm waiting? - Would you cut it out, Derek? - What's that, Casey? I'm trying to study. - Term hasn't even started yet, you diseased keener! - It's university, not pre-school, Derek. - What a shame you have to go on vacation tomorrow. - I know. But it's a beautiful place, and at least I get a break from you. - And I'll be left alone in the house with a very large guest list. When, oh when will dad learn? - Derek... - Enjoy your evil grandmother. - Uh, Derek... behind you. - Actually, Derek, as of right now, you're going on vacation, too. - No! - NO! - Come on, everyone! Let's go! - Edwin, you're not taking your cell phone, your brother's laptop, or the game station. - But dad, I need to! This is how I relax. Nature is boring! - No. - Guys, wait 'til you see grandma's lodge. It's the best. - We're going on vacation! YAHOO! - Your excitement irks me. - Oooh, it irks him. Edwin! My bag. - Watch it. Coming through! - Casey, I still can't get over mom calling out of the blue to invite the grandkids to visit. Do you think she's finally come around? - Mom, she's never even met Derek. - Well, I'm sure he'll be on his best behaviour... - Yeah, you just keep thinking that. - Derek! Come on! - All right. See you there. - Okay. Edwin? You're coming with us, all right? Casey, you'll go with Derek. - What? -: WHY? - So Casey can make sure that Derek doesn't accidentally head South, instead of North. - Little trust, dad. - Trust there, party boy? - Buckle up, Derek. - How about I drive, and you don't talk? - Look. How bad could it be? A week by the lake at the end of summer? - The thing is, Case, I don't vacate with siblings, and I most definitely don't vacate with their grandmothers. What does she have against my dad, anyway? - My dad is the one she told mom to marry, and your dad isn't. Plus, she doesn't believe in divorce. - What about your grandfather? - Divorced her and moved to Alaska 20 years ago. - Fascinating. - You always drive so slowly. - I do not! - ♪♪ All is quiet... ♪ ♪ Pretend I'm gonna lose you once more ♪ ♪ I can't find it ♪ ♪ Tears fall as she slips on the door ♪ ♪ She's cryin' ♪ - Hah!

Actually, just arrest her. - My stepbrother's trying to be funny, officer. Please ignore him like everyone else does. - I think there's something you should know about my stepsister. She has a bit of a speeding problem. She sees the speed limit, she doubles it. - Derek, you idiot. Cops don't have a sense of humour. - Sure we do! Now, sit tight while I check a few things. - DEREK! - Wow. - Isn't it beautiful? - Uh... they have electricity here, right? - Grandma! - Darling! Oh! What... have you done to your hair? - Do you like it? - No... but I like you, so I'll get used to it. My goodness! It's purple! - Wait 'til your mother sees how big you are. - Yeah... - You told her about the baby, right? Nora! - Hello, mom! How are you? Oh, well I'm fine, as you can see. Actually, I'm more than fine, since I'm-- - Pregnant. Nora! At your age? Isn't it exciting? A real MacDonald-Venturi! Oh, we're so happy. Aren't we, George? - We sure are. Hey, it's great to see you again, Felicia! - George. How's that impressive little law practice of yours? Still going to bat for all those worthwhile causes? - Sure am... - Such a shame there's no money in it, and a sixth child. Nora. I had no idea. - I was gonna tell you, but I thought, "Why not make it a surprise?" - Because of how much I like surprises. Lizzy, where's the beautiful sister of yours? - Uh, she's getting a ride with Derek. - With Derek. What Derek? What Derek? What Derek? - Hey Felicia. It's uh... it's good to see you again. It's some uh... nice place you got here. - Hi, Felicia. - Nice to see you. Thank you. Any more surprises, Nora? - Well, you did invite them, didn't you? - Oh, did I? - Didn't you? - Grandma? Is that turtle still under the dock? - Yes, darling, it is. I'll show you. Nora. - George... when my mother invited the grandchildren, she only meant my children. - Well, should I take mine home? - No! Of course not. They're all ours. For Pete's sake, it's been 4 years! You know what? This was supposed to happen. - Nora, you can't. - Oh, yes I can. Mom? At first, I thought, "This is awkward." But now I'm thinking, "What a happy accident!" - Is it? - Yes, it is. Because now you can finally get to know Marty, Edwin and Derek. - Yes, but I... - They'll be no trouble at all. And we'll only be in Montreal for a few days. Casey will take care of the younger ones, and Derek will take care of himself. Won't he, George? - Oh, yes. Yes, he will. Now, what could possibly go wrong? Please? - I'd be delighted to have them. - Oh... I'll get the luggage! - I'll go get the kids. - I can't believe Officer Defonzo made us go to the station. - You're lucky they didn't take the car apart after you told them I was a conman, a counterfeiter, and a kleptomaniac. - I was mad. - What's with Ed? - Finally! Where have you guys been? We gotta get outta here! - Edwin, try to speak without spitting. - We're in some freaky sort of time warp. It turns out that the Great Blue Heron Lodge is this woodsy, get-back-to-nature kind of place. There's no TV, no internet, the boats don't have motors... I bet you gotta make your ice cream with a salad spinner right after you carve your own paddle! - I thought this was supposed to be a vacation, not a seminar. - What about the beauty of nature, boys? - It gets worse! See, it turns out that we, the Venturis, weren't actually invited. Felicia wanted the MacDonalds, her blood grandchildren. - What did dad say? - Goodbye. They left for Montreal about an hour ago. - What? - Derek, you're my father now! Save me! - Edwin, I will never be your father. But hop in. We're goin' home. - Uh, you are not. - YES! - Derek! Don't be so immature. We're all in this together. - ♪♪ Come on let's go one two three four ♪ - Edwin, get the keys from Casey. Never send a boy to do a man's job.

Classic! - Oh, man. That was a high school highlight! Unlike your grades, bro. - Ah, grades are so overrated. - Oh, that's so, so true. - Derek, why don't we discuss something other than you? - I'm sorry. How rude of me. Felicia, let's talk about you. Like how you boycotted dad and Nora's wedding. - Derek! - Don't be ridiculous. I was busy at the lodge and I couldn't get away. - Really? 'Cause it seemed like-- - Here, Derek.

She'll call dad to explain, but the Venturis are outta here! - I'll send the spare car keys tomorrow, Case. - If my brothers are leaving, then I'm leaving too! - It's kind of a Venturi guy thing, kiddo. - But... what about family togetherness? - Felicia's your family Lizzy. - We're all the same family! - Liz, after their behaviour tonight, I think the boys should leave. - No! They shouldn't. - I agree with Lizzy. The boys should stay. - Marty, don't do that. - Or what? - Or you're goin' for a swim! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Don't do it! Don't do it! - Derek, put her down. - Gran thinks the Venturis are inferior to the Macdonalds. Doesn't that bother you, Derek? - Don't listen to her! - LISTEN TO HER! - If you leave, gran wins. - Yeah! - And Casey wants you to leave, too. - Yeah! - We're staying? Oh, you have betrayed me. You've gone over to the ranks of the uncool! You are a huge disappointment. - You just crossed the line. - Very funny, Derek. Pfff. I should go... AAAH! - Come here, Edwin! DEREK! - Lizzy, what have you done? - The right thing? : No, Derek! NO! - Ugh, Edwin! - It wasn't me! - Yes it was. - Great news, Felicia. We've decided to stay. - Oh... how nice. - I figured, why go back to the hot city, when we can chill by a lake? Brought you some orange juice. - That's nice. - Don't you want it? - Derek, this is my morning ritual. - Yeah? - A skinny dip. - Lizzy's making me go to the marsh. - You wanna come? - No, sorry guys. I gotta study. Have fun! - It's okay, Marty. It's okay. - I don't have anything to do. - Where's Derek? - He's taking his post-breakfast nap. - Well... make friends with those nice boys playing croquet. - Croquet? - BOO! - Hello... - Buzz my lodge will you, you appalling man! - 20 feet, Dougie! Or I call the OPP! - Oh, come on, Felicia. Is that any way to treat a neighbour with a business proposition? - I told you, I am not selling! - Come on, I'm offering you so much more than this old place is even worth! - You have no idea what this place is worth! - It's just a matter of time! - Impressive. - It's only a matter of time, my butt! I mean... my foot - A matter of time before what? - Before I will sell my land to be part of an ugly, awful resort. TERRIBLE! - That's a nice shot, there, Ben. - I'm Ben. He's Sven. - Right. Okay. Ben, Sven, what do you say we amp this thing up a little bit? - We're listening. - Okay, I'm thinking extreme croquet. It's one point if you hit a tree, two points if you get it in the water, three if you hit a guest. I'm just kidding about that last one. - You're on. - You're on. - Now that's a vacation destination. - Hey. I'm Derek. - I'm Roxy. - Well, Roxy, I was just... I was wondering if I could take a look at your... volleyball court, for professional playability. - And you would know because...? - Just so happens I'm... a volleyball solo Olympian. Allow me to demonstrate. An underhander with an altitude bypass, and he returns it with a special reverse whipover! Are you sure this is regulation sand? - My clever granddaughter. Off to university. Have you chosen your major? - I'm planning a double major in English and Economics, with a view to business or law. - You're so different from your mother. You know, when she was your age, she actually wanted to be an actress. - Really? - Yes! Oh, well thankfully, it was only a stage. And then she met your father, and it was love at first sight. Why she ever left that wonderful man, I will never know. - Gran, I think if you gave George a chance, you'd really like him, too. - I highly doubt that, especially if he's anything like his sons. - Derek and Edwin aren't so bad. - FORE! - OH! Mr. Sampson! Are you all right? - Oh, perfect! Yesterday a bun, today a croquet ball. What kind of a projectile shall I expect for tomorrow? A deck chair? - I'm so sorry. - Dude, I had no idea you could get air with a croquet ball! - That was awesome! - Edwin! - May I introduce my stepsister, Casey? - You certainly may. - She's a goddess from the Planet Perfect. - Unbelievable! Edwin, what is wrong with you? You nearly whacked an old man! You are acting like a hooligan! How could you and your friends be so totally inconsiderate? Not to mention reckless, obnoxious, ill-mannered, and I am disappointed in your behaviour. All right? -: Absolutely. - Guys? Hey, guys! Ribbit. - It's okay, Marty. It's just some kid spying on us. - My name's Oscar, and I'm not spying. - Aren't you that too-cool-to- dance kid from the lodge? - No... - You are! Hiding 'cause you look so nerdy in that outfit? - I'm a junior ornithologist. I study birds. - Yeah, I know what an ornithologist is. - It's not nerdy. - Look. Anyone who likes nature isn't nerdy in my books. Whatcha got? - 3 warblers, a Whiskey Jack, Northern Flicker, Look! Great Blue Heron! They nest here every spring. - That's the prettiest bird I've ever seen! - Awesome! - Awesome! And is that the sweet hum of air conditioning I hear? - Yeah. - Roxy! You brought a friend! Doug Dunbarton. - Derek Venturi. I'm staying over at the Great Blue Heron Lodge. - Ooh, my condolences. What do you think of my humble abode? - Well, this is a vacation palace. - Palace? I like that. Well, any friend of my daughter's is a friend of mine. Make yourself at home, play with the toys, but um... Keep your hands off Roxy! - Dad! You think you're funny, but you're not. - Okay, Ed. You ready for a little extreme water polo? - I most certainly am. - I don't know Ben, we better be careful. We don't want Edwin's stepsister coming to lecture us again. : YES! - Got it! - Hey, Sven! Pass it over here! Come on! I'm open! Come on! Over here! - Ed! Ready for a long ball? - Yeah! ♪♪♪ - Go for a long ball! - Okay! - Derek! - Hey, Derek! - Derek! Watch out! - Whoa! Derek!

Oh, Edwin. You must be starving after nearly decapitating one of my guests with a croquet ball. - Yeah... I'm sorry about that. - Uh... Edwin. - Oh! - And you! Nearly mowing down your own brother while paling around with the daughter of my archenemy. - Sorry, Felicia. Just thought it was another hot brunette with a nice cottage. - Please don't be mad, Gran. We lost track of time 'cause it's so cool at the marsh. We were bird watching, and we watched the Heron! - That very same Heron has been coming here for years. This might interest you, Derek. That hot brunette's grandfather, Arthur Dunbarton, he commissioned an environmental study listing all the plants and all the wildlife-- and some of them are very rare and at risk-- that thrive in that marsh. - Fascinating. - There were dragonflies and bullfrogs and turtles... - And salamanders! - And the cutest little snake came up to say hi! - There are no cute snakes. - Derek's ophidophobic. - No, I just hate snakes. - But just wait until you see-- - I felt something. - Concern for the environment? - No, under the table. - GET IT! - Get what? AAAH! SNAKE! - He didn't like the food? - Marty, not in the dining room! - I'm sorry! And you two... I want to have a word with both of you. Right now. OUT! - I got it! I--Whoa! Easy. : It's all my fault. - Oh, Marty. Gran doesn't want you to leave. Just the boys. - Yeah, it's not your fault Edwin zipped the tablecloth into his fly. - Come on. That happens to guys all the time! - Sure it does. Or that Derek's ophidophobic. - Hear that, Mikey? - Marty! Get that thing outta here! - Okay, okay! Keep your shirt on! - Anyway, who cares? This is great! We're kicked off the vacation we didn't even want to be on, right? Right, Der? - Actually... I could stay a little while. - Oh, COME ON! - Casey, you should ask Gran to give them another chance. You're her favourite. - Forget it! Derek's been rude since he got here, and now he wants to stay? - I've been rude? Felicia didn't even invite us, and she thinks our dad isn't good enough for your mom! - I know that's ridiculous, but gran never changes her mind. About you guys leaving, about the marriage, about anything. - And that's okay, Case? You need to pick a side. - What's this? - Gran, if the Venturi boys are leaving, we're all leaving. - What? In heaven's name, why? - Because. We're family. - Casey, if you're trying to blackmail me into changing my mind, it won't work because-- - You never change your mind. - Casey, this is not like you. - Has anyone seen Marty? - No... - Us either. - I'll handle this. This is my responsibility. - I'll handle this, Felicia. She's my sister. Lizzy, logistics: could Marty be in the dining room? - Negative, Derek. We already ate breakfast. - State of mind? - Upset about leaving? - Hiding? - Possible, but unlikely. - Edwin? - I'm thinking about the snake. - I told you not to mention-- - But that's all she talked about at breakfast. - Maybe she went back to the marsh to put Mikey back. - Interesting theory. Where is this marsh? - Around the next bay. We took the paddleboat. How many paddleboats are there? - Two. Five canoes. - I'm on it! ...two... three. Two paddle boats but only four canoes! - Boom. Let's act fast. - Okay. Derek, use this flare to signal if you find her. Are you sure you can manage that craft? - Yeah. I'm sure. You take the left, I'll take the right. - Hurry! - Goodbye Mikey. - Okay. You go right, I'll go left. - I went to camp for five years! Let me stern. - I can stern! - Then do a J-stroke. Derek! - Okay! You stern. - Don't touch me. Don't touch me! - STROKE! STROKE! STROKE! There's the canoe! - Where's Marty? - DEREK! CASEY! I'm over here! - I see her! - We're coming, Marty! - THEY FOUND HER! Oh, God! - Please don't be mad! - We're not mad, Marty! We're just so relieved you're okay! - I'm mad. Don't you ever go off like that. You have to tell someone, especially on water. It's dangerous. - I'm really, really sorry, Smereck. Look! Isn't it beautiful? - Incredibly beautiful. - Not bad. - Come on. Let's go back to the Lodge. Hey, what's that guy doing? - Oh, Marty! I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you! Now, let's go... And get those suitcases. - But gran... - And put them back in the cabin. Marty, your brothers are appalling, but I never meant to upset you! So, just this once, I've changed my mind. - Really? - I knew this was gonna be the best vacation! - Right. Let's go! Run! - Right on schedule, you wretched man. Does Dunbarton think he's going to actually annoy me into selling? - WAAAH! Sorry! - Hey, Derek... Coming? - Absolutely! - Just when I was starting to think he wasn't so bad. - Dunbarton? - No. Derek. - Hey there. - Hi. - Listen, I was wondering um... Nah, forget it. - Forget what? - Well, you're busy. It's okay. - Just tell me. - Do you want to rehearse something with me? I've got half the day off, and I'm working on a new routine. - I'd love to... but I probably shouldn't. It's just... I set this study schedule for myself and I... - It's cool. I'll see you later. - Um... you know, guys, I've been thinking. Maybe I should refrain from the extreme sports. - Dude, we totally get it. - We totally do! -: You're a girl! - That's a lame attempt to bait, me, boys. Because I am very confident about my guyness. - Sure you are. Catch you at arts and crafts? - I would love a beaded friendship bracelet. - I could get used to this. - The beauty of nature? - I meant the company. But the nature's not bad, either. - Well, I don't usually hang with travelling volleyball court testers. - Oh? You only date rich guys? - I might make an exception. - Really? 'Cause I make it a rule not to date rich girls. - Really? - Really... No. Though my grandmother is not too happy I'm hanging out with you. - Your grandmother? - Felicia Webster. - Felicia is your grandmother? - Step-grandmother. Not that she's pleased about it. - Dad's planning to build a resort where her quaint little lodge is. - So I heard, though I don't think she'll be selling her quaint little lodge. - Of course she will. She won't have any choice. - What do you mean? - When my dad wants something, he usually gets it. - And do you think the way your dad thinks? - Not always. - Hey! You changed your mind. - Are you sure I'm good enough? - You'll do. - It's just I've never really worked on a routine with a guy before. My dance school was mostly girls. - Oh, you'll see. It's the same, but different. Come. I'll show you what I've worked out so far. Yeah? So... Jacket. You're gonna step on your right... left... Left... right. - Better safety up, bro. This could get ugly. - You're into parkour, right? - Yeah! Sure. Um... park what? - It's an obstacle course. It tests speed, agility, and daring, and all around general guyness. Ready, Ben? 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. 20 seconds, bro! You rock! Hey, you ready, Eddie? - Uh... yeah! Most def. - 5... 4... 3... 2... 1! : Nasty. : Good, good. Come on in here. Now look at this! So how'd it go? - Not bad. Saw a few nice birds. - Well, I hope they like yachts. - Marsh is only 4 feet deep. - It'll be a lot deeper once I dredge it out, now won't it? That is the future location of my new marina. - What about your neighbour on the other side? - That old bat? She'll sell. And if she doesn't, I'll dig out my half of the marsh. Come on. - Don't teenage boys have any common sense, or are you particularly idiotic? - I dunno. - How is his wretched ankle? - Well, he seems to have severed his dorfal flanger. - Whoa, whoa. What about my flanger? - Just a little medical joke? Merely a slightly sprained ankle. - Funny joke. - Why don't you take it easy for a couple of days? And please stay out of trouble! - Oh, believe me. He will. - So, you never wanted to be a dancer? - Sure I did... like I wanted to be a princess. It's a crazy profession. I mean for me, not for you. It's absolutely right for you. - No. It's crazy for anyone! I was in New York for 3 years, trying to get a break. - Is everyone that much better? - I freeze up at auditions. - You? - Don't make me feel bad about it! Hey. Same time tomorrow? - If I can still walk! - Hey, thanks for helping. - They're still here. I thought they gave them the boot! - At the marsh, we counted 25 different kinds of birds! - That's very nice. Edwin! Manners! - Yes, ma'am. - Oscar helped. He's a cute junior ornithologist Lizzy likes. - Marty! - Gotta love those junior ornithologists. - Plus, that surveyor guy was back... remember, Casey? - The one we saw when we rescued you? - Yeperoonie! - A surveyor? I don't like the sounds of that. - Felicia! Did you do something to your hair? - Did you do something to your watch? - I saw that surveyor guy, too... meeting with Dunbarton. - You didn't happen to hear what they were talking about, did you? - You mean, was I eaves dropping? - That's what I was hoping, yes. - Something about digging out the marsh for a marina. - Digging up the marsh? - Can he do that? - No. He can't. He already tried to change the zoning once, and he failed. At least, that's what I thought. Edwin, no shenanigans while I'm gone. - Yes, ma'am. - And don't call me ma'am! - Sure thing, granny. - Hey, gran. Um... brought you some dessert. You okay? - Oh, yeah. I'm fine. - You don't seem fine. - Dunbarton appealed the zoning decision... which will never work, but... I don't know. I'll know for sure by the end of the week. - If Dunbarton gets his way, what'll happen to the Herons? - They'll leave if there's nowhere to feed. - Guess Felicia's going to have to rename the lodge. - What lodge? Edwin, you don't get it! That kind of boat traffic will ruin the lodge, not to mention the lake. - Oh. - We need to do something. Derek, you like to be in charge. What's the plan? - The plan is to go to Roxy's to watch movies on her flat screen. - Consorting with the enemy? Oh, that's rich. Yes. Yes, she is. It's not our fight, Liz. - Slime. - I heard that. - Whatever. He was a long shot, anyway. Where's Casey? - She's dancing with Jesse. - In the middle of a crisis? - Oh, no, no! No! Ow! - Edwin, are you okay with the death of this planet? - Yeah, are you, Edwin? - I was so bored over here until you came. I mean, all dad can talk about is the resort and the marina and the golf course. - So, do you like what he's doing? - Why not? I mean, it's a beautiful spot. I think more people should get to enjoy it. - But what if there's nothing left to enjoy? - Excuse me? - I don't know. Have you seen the Herons? - Of course I have. My grandfather took me to the marsh all the time to bird watch or to go fishing. - Is this the grandfather that commissioned a study about the importance of the marsh to the local wildlife? - I've never heard of it. And I didn't take you for the eco-crusader type. - Oh... I'm totally not. - Well, I happen to miss my grandfather a lot. - Forget I said anything. - Ahem? - I kissed Derek, so he kissed me back. - I pride myself on my manners, sir. But I should be going. - I'd say so. - Gotcha. Bye, Roxy. - All right. Here's the spin. And face each other. - Got it. - Okay. Look at my eyes. - I am looking at you. - No, you're looking at my eyebrows. Look at my eyes. - But then I might forget the steps. - Why? - Because then it's just so personal. - Dancing is supposed to be personal. Yeah? From the top. Fantastic! You guys will be the finale! - Finale? - I'm organizing this rally- type-thing with entertainment to save the marsh. - I don't know, Liz. A rally seems... kind of ambitious. - No, it doesn't! It's genius! - I think it's time for bed, kiddo. Good night, Jesse. - Night, you two. - Don't "kiddo" me. That was a brush-off. - Please, Casey? - I'm asleep. - But you like it up here just as much as I do. - Of course I do, but we leave in 3 days. Be realistic. - You sound like Derek. - Ouch. - You and Jesse look really good together. - Lizzy. Go to sleep. -: Gross. - It wasn't me. - Yes it was! - Are you coming, Derek? Daddy says he's sorry, don't you, daddy? - Absolutely. Oh! Good morning, Felicia! Guess what! Today, I've got an even more generous offer. - I know what you're up to, Dougie. You're planning to drain the marsh! - Oh, really? Well in that case, I suggest you accept this offer before I change my mind and offer you a lot less. - You can take your offer, or your threat, or whatever you think it is, and you can just-- You can eat it. - Are you coming, Derek? - You know, I think I'm going to pass for today. - What? - Maybe tomorrow? - Yeah? Maybe not. - Dude! Didn't think you had it in you. - Some filing to do to keep you busy. I've got a meeting with the mayor. - Actually, Felicia, the filing is going to have to wait, and I'll need to use your phone. - Oh, really? And why is that? - We're going to organize a rally to save the marsh. - KID POWER! - It's touching, Lizzy, it really is, but there's not much that three kids can do. - Oh, I think there's a lot they can do... because I'm going to help them. - I knew you'd come through, Casey! - I'm bored, so I'll help, too. - Whoa! - All right, then.

So, how are we doing, Derek? - Well, the dishwasher can sort of juggle, your friend Oscar's going to do some birdcalls, and that's about it. - That's it? - Casey's choreographing some Hip-Hoppy dance thing. - Well, two of my dancers can't concentrate, and the other two oogle me. Need I say more? - Sheesh. Edwin, how many press have said they'll come? - Well, I've got 4 "no"s, and one "highly unlikely." - Why don't we just forget the whole thing?

I'm-- - Yeah, we know. - Great. Well, I'm looking for guests with hidden talents. - Then you've come to the right place! Mr. Sampson here used to be a professional comedian. - Hard to believe, isn't it? By the way, Rosie happens to be a terrific dancer. - Oh, I just dabble. - You're in! - Maybe my son will come up and see his old mother perform. Did I tell you he's a famous choreographer? - Terrific! Mr. Sampson, my brother has this idea that he's funny. Any chance you want a partner for your act? - I hate teenagers. - Great. Well, he loves cranky old guys! - So... can you fix it? - I don't know. - Thanks. Lizzy still wants us to perform for the finale. - The routine's not ready. - Then we'll get it ready. - You and your sister sure are pushy, huh? - But it's a good thing... right? - Right. - Hello, this is Edwin Venturi um... the Third speaking, with a story to pitch. Let's hear it? Okay... A group of kids have teamed up to save a marsh located on Great Blue Heron lake, which is home to as many as... 30 species of bird, including these two stunning Great Blue Herons, not to mention other forms of wildlife who rely on this lush wetland for their ecosystem. Go on? Well... okay... There is this quaint little lodge on this jewel of a lake, and it's being threatened by a greedy land developer. - ♪♪ Wake up sleepy head ♪ ♪ Time to get up, move around ♪ - Wow!

I just agreed to sell the lodge to Dunbarton. I'm signing the paper work tomorrow, so would you all just please just go to bed. - Gran. Gran! But, gran... why? - The town council agreed to the rezoning. Dunbarton can build whatever he wants. And I'm not going to stay here and watch the lake I love be destroyed. - So you're giving up? - I am being realistic. He's far more powerful than I am. And I never expected to find you partying with that crowd, Casey. For heaven's sake, stay focused on your studies! You're going to end up just like your mother. - What does that mean? - On her second marriage? Five children? Another one on the way? - Gran, how can you say that about mom? How can you refuse to come to the wedding, and then spend 4 years pretending George and his kids don't exist? George makes mom way happier than dad ever did, and when you cut yourself off from our wonderful family, then it's your loss. I don't care anymore. You're not even excited about the new baby! "Guys... I'm getting a ride to the bus station. "I can't look at gran after the things I said last night. "Liz, I am so sorry about the show being cancelled. - "Don't ever doubt you did the right thing. "See you back at home, Casey." The right thing? It was a stupid thing. You know, I tried so hard and made you guys work so hard, when we never even had a chance. Gran gave up without a fight. Casey left. I give up, too. - No, Liz. You can't give up. - We can still have the show! - The show that's a rally to save something we already lost? Forget it. - Derek, do something! - Who? Me? I'm the do as little as possible guy. - Well, you're my new role model. - Derek, you saved me from the marsh! That makes you the do something kind of guy! - Smarty, there's no secret weapon against money and power. - Derek! We do, too have a secret weapon against money and power! Come on! - Edwin, I love the guy, but he's hardly a secret weapon. - Derek, it's impossible. What could I do in a few hours? I'd need proof of the environmental impact. I mean, I need to find a judge on a Sunday! No, it can't be done. - So, you'll try? - Of course. - I was hoping you were Casey. - She... got a bus home. - Oh, Derek. What have I done? - So, I was wondering... - I was so upset last night about selling the lodge that... I said some things to Casey I shouldn't have said, and then she said some things to me that... well, I didn't want to hear. - Felicia, you mentioned an environmental report about the marsh? - Oh, you mean the one Arthur Dunbarton commissioned? It must be somewhere, you know, in the office. Derek, I have made the same mistake with Casey that I did with Nora! - Maybe the bus hasn't left yet. - Derek! You're absolutely right! - Yes. I am. - What a bummer! - It's got to be here somewhere. - Yeah, well it's not. - Somebody has to have a copy. - Dunbarton, I guess. His father commissioned the report. I seriously doubt she's talking to me. No. No way. Come up to the lodge, we'll have a few laughs. Save a lake. - In a hurry to get somewhere, young lady? - I most certainly am. It's terribly important. - Well, how about you slow down and get there safely? - Absolutely. And thank you. - Consider it... a warning. - I had to take one more shot. Our only chance of saving the marsh is that study your grandfather commissioned. - If I had that report, do you actually think I would give it to you? - No. Not really. - Roxy. What is he doing here? - He's just leaving. You left this the other night. Saves me a trip. - Thanks, I guess. See you. - Gran, what are you doing here? - I couldn't let you leave after that horrible conversation. - I'm really sorry. I never should have said those things. - No. On the contrary, you're absolutely right. I am stubborn. And I alienate the people that I love. But that doesn't mean I don't love them. - I know. - Please come back, Casey. - Losing you, that hurts way more than losing the lodge. - Won't the judge just take your word for it? - Highly unlikely. - Well? - Sorry, Marty. No go. What's that? It's the report. We've got the report. - WE'VE GOT IT! WE'VE GOT IT! - Got it. We got it. : We got it! We got it! We got it! - My associates were successful. - The fax is on its way. - Ah... Your Honour. - Well, this is interesting. - You found Casey! - You found Casey! - We couldn't very well have a show without a finale, now could we? - Yeah, but the lodge is being sold. - Well, I say we go out with a bang. What do you think, Lizzy? - I say okay. - Excellent. All right, Marty. I believe we have some banners to hang. - We sure do! - Don't ever run out on me like that again. - I'm so sorry, Liz. - It's okay. We'll talk about it later. Right now, we have a show to do, and a secret weapon against Dunbarton. Well, if he gets here on time. - A secret weapon?

Before we start, Felicia Webster has a few words. Felicia? - Thanks. Thank you. - There you go. - Um... I'm sorry to have to announce that this will be the last summer for the Great Blue Heron Lodge. The lake is about to change forever. But... let's treat this as a celebration, not as a wake, and let's remember all the wonderful years. And the magic of this very special place.

George? - Who is this man? - I'm George Venturi. I'm Felicia's lawyer. I have an injunction stopping all development in the area until a new environmental assessment has been conducted. - This is just a ridiculous, desperate attempt to stall the inevitable. - Well, the judge didn't think so. Not after I showed him the environmental report your own father commissioned. - Thank you. - Is this real? It's just a temporary setback. - Really? I'm guessing your strategy involved moving quickly and discretely, but thanks to my children, your plans, they are no longer a secret. - Care to comment on this development, Mr. Dunbarton? - Get out of my way. - Nicely done, George.

Thank you guys so much for coming, but before you go, there is someone special I would like to thank: My sister. Lizzy? Lizzy, come on out. - When Lizzy cares about something, she makes cynical guys like me think anything is possible. Thanks to her, and some other remarkable people who took a stand, the impossible happened today. We'll see you next year at Great Blue Heron Lodge! - Wetlands used to be known as wastelands, when actually, they're these magical places that wildlife depend on, for example, the Great Blue Heron. They rely on wetlands to nest or to forage for food... - That was huge, what you did. - Well, I did it for my grandfather. - You know, girls who take a stand are really attractive. - They are, are they? - Hey! - Casey Macdonald, meet my famous son, Bernard Blue. - Ma, cut it out. - I am so thrilled to meet you! - You, too! - Jesse, tell Casey your news. - Well, Bernard just offered me a part in his new show. - One of the leads. - I am so happy for you! - Thanks! - And I need you, too. - Me? But... I don't... I was just... I never... - Really? I think you did. And you should. But decide if it's what you want. Let me know as soon as possible. - I will. - See you. - Gran. You will never guess what just happened. - Your mother told me. - I'm supposed to start university in a week. - I know. - I guess I could defer for a year... but that would be crazy, right? - Certainly would.
