There is no close substitute for water. It's the most precious resource we have. We are not treating it as a crisis when we should be treating it as a crisis. Imagine if tomorrow, we cured cancer, and in a hundred years, there were still a million kids dying of cancer. It would be unthinkable, but that's the situation we find ourselves in with water. The government has failed in telling the population the truth about the situation that we are facing. About 7.7 billion people have inherited the Earth. Almost two billion of us are struggling to survive without clean drinking water. The water crisis isn't imminent. It isn't looming. It's here... now. The UN estimated that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in water stress regions. People are not gonna be starving and dying instantly. They're gonna be moving. They won't have the resources to live where they're at. Contrary to popular thought, this crisis isn't just a developing world problem. It is already beginning to impact everyone everywhere. Our changing climate is less forgiving, keeping more water for itself. Pollution is corrupting our supplies. Infrastructures are failing faster than they can be repaired. And everyday, there are more people in the world all thirsting for water. More often than not, a water crisis isn't an act of nature. It's an act of humankind. By not planning, by not using the right technologies, and by not acting soon enough, we set ourselves up to fail. It's a truly daunting crisis, but what if the solutions were already at hand? Right now all around the globe, an army of visionaries and innovators is working to reimagine and reinvent water systems to generate, supply, and clean the water we all depend on for our very lives. The water challenges facing the world really fall into three categories. First is the scarcity of water. Second is building resilient infrastructure against climate change. And third is doing all that in a way that's affordable for society. The problem with this crisis is the water that's drinkable is gonna start disappearing and the water that's not drinkable is gonna start appearing everywhere. There are solutions. It's just a matter of bringing them to bear on the problem and we can fix it. We are running against the clock in terms of solving these issues. In a sense, it breaks my heart that we have the solutions, right? And then we can't get them out fast enough. The demand for water to sustain not only the population but the lifestyle that we have has grown just tremendously, but we're still trying to do things the way we've done them in the past. Back around the turn of the century, really everybody was responsible for their own sewage. They were responsible for their own water. They drilled a well, dug a well, or they got water out of a creek. And then they used a pit latrine or a sewage lagoon behind the house. Of course, there were public health issues with that. People were getting sick, and so the governments around the world kinda stepped in and said that this is an intrinsic government function. We need to provide for the safety and welfare of the community, and money's really no object. So they ended up with these incredibly expensive sewer systems where there's a pipe to everybody's house. There's a water pipe to everybody's house, there's a sewer pipe to everybody's house. Incredibly complex networks of systems that get old and all have to be replaced. And huge expense associated with it, but it provided a safe environment. It dealt with the public health issues associated with that. Attempting to engineer our way our of trouble is deepening the problem. As we throw more and more resources at outmoded infrastructure, the challenge is to let go of an older inefficient system and start to open our minds to new ways of managing water. Nothing focuses the mind like a crisis. So when Flint, Michigan faced a shocking crisis of lead contamination in its drinking water, activists not only demanded change, but actively sought creative solutions to the problem. One such creatively focused mind belongs to rapper, actor, and entrepreneur Jaden Smith. My motivation around water started when I was about 11 years old. And it came from me learning about the environment from my teachers in school. It got to the point where I really wanted to make an active change and I wanted to do something that could make a difference in the world. I always wanted to go above and beyond and just go across the world and make an impact, and make a change, you know? I want to put a filtration system in Africa. I want to put a filtration system in India. As I started to evolve these ideas, I started to realize that we have problems so close to home. We have water sanitation issues that are right here in our backyard that need to be addressed. And seeing the effect that this crisis has had on everyone in Flint, Michigan. When you see the kids there and when you see the elderly people, that still they can't use the water that's coming out of the pipes, it's heart wrenching. We wanted to give back to that community and purify the water for people who don't have access for clean water. That is why we did The Water Box in Flint. What it does is it filters water and it delivers 10 gallons of clean water every 60 seconds. It's specifically made to filter out the lead and we have people on site that are testing the water every single day. The entire plan and the goal to make it work here first and then to take it places across the world that are having the same issues and say okay, well maybe this is not a lead problem over here, so we can change the configuration of the machine. The goal is to have it wherever it would be necessary and to modify it for that specific places so that it wold work efficiently just as it does in Flint. Water is viewed as a global issue because it affects everybody on the planet, but really at it's heart, it's a local issue, because we have to deal with it city by city, town by town. So what we see is that people who are really at the coalface who are struggling with drought or deteriorating water quality, those are the people on the edges and on the fringes who are really innovating. And that's where the future lies. One innovator on one such fringe is Beth Koiji who had to think outside the box when her well ran dry. When I was doing my undergraduate, I think I was tired of getting on and off waterborne diseases. So I started making my own water filter in my dorm, that heal or remove all bacterias. I started going to community with it showing people how to make a simple filter in your house because actually filters are not that cheap in Kenya. And in 2016, Kenya was facing a huge drought and we felt that people now didn't see filters as a solution because they actually don't have enough water to filter. The only choice here is to fetch water from the river. Children are sent to the river the whole day so they don't attend school. The water has high level of chemical contaminants, so basically, you cannot drink that water. So we were looking at something specific that is able to utilize the humidity in air. Frustrated with her own experience of watching water scarcity ravage her country, Beth looks to nature to solve the problem. Getting water from air has never been a new concept. In nature, there are some Namibian beetle that actually have its drinking water from the atmosphere. There's six times more water in the atmosphere than there is in all the wells around the world. So that is a huge resource that is yet to be properly tapped. She designed a machine that extracts clean water from the atmosphere and she calls it Majik. Beth took her invention to the Ark Children's Orphanage so kids could focus on education instead of walking miles for water. These technologies are very, very simple. It works the same as the refrigerator and an air conditioner. The air is pulled in by a fan and then passed through a condenser coil. That's where the condensing happens and then the water is dispensed to a collecting tank. We just came from a very dry season, so this was the only source of drinking water for these children. It's for security for them. As long as you have air, you can have clean drinking water. Technological innovation isn't enough in places where the primary obstacle to obtaining clean water is something as simple as it is elusive. Money. Today in 2019, it's a million children a year under the age of five die because they lack access to safe water and sanitation. The very first water collection I went on was when the magnitude of the problem hit me. I was in a very rural village in Zambia and I was with this 14 year old girl. She picked up the jerry can, I picked up a jerry can, and we walked off together with an interpreter. And we walked about a while to this bore-well to fill these jerry cans. I asked her, "What are you gonna do when you grow up? "Are you gonna live here in this village?" And she looked around. She was like, "No, I'm not staying here." She goes, "I'm going to Lusaka, "I'm going to the big city." She's like, "I'm gonna be a nurse." It reminded me of being 14, and with Ben Affleck, and saying we're gonna go to the big city of New York, and we're gonna be actors. I was just brought back to that feeling. And it wasn't until I drove away that it hit me that had it not been for someone having the foresight to sink this bore-well a mile from this kid's house, she wouldn't have any hope for any type of future whatsoever. She would be spending her entire day not in school, but rather collecting water. Please welcome Matt Damon and Gary White. I read one of the stories from your organization where there a woman who was paying $60 a month to get bottled water delivered to her so that she could have something to drink. Through your program, she got a loan to have her own water source and then pays back the loan at five or $6 a month. Exactly. Which is a simple and yet insane concept that nobody has thought of that. -Is it that simple? -Yes. - Giving access to money-- - Yes. To make their own water source? Yes. And then they participate in their own solution. They fix their own problem. what we do is we break down the barriers between people and safe water and sanitation. We're able to help them with financing so that they can afford filters at the household level. So that people can enjoy the fact, not just that they don't have to walk for water anymore, but they also have safe potable water. Having raised and deployed about 27 million dollars in philanthropic capital, that has unleashed 1.1 billion dollars in these micro-loans so that people can get their water and sanitation solutions that best meet their needs. The real success story for us in this entire endeavor has been the fact that the loans that we make pay back at 99%. And that is astonishing. To know that these are the poorest people on Earth and all they want is that if you nudge the markets toward them a little bit and give them the dignity to solve their own problem, they will. And if you think of them instead of as a charity case as a customer with their own economic citizenship, then you're gonna be floored by what they do. And we've done over three million of these loans now, so that 99% number is very real. Of course, access to clean water is only part of the equation. A healthy and sustainable future also depends on solving an equally urgent aspect of the crisis. Sanitation. According to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, poor sanitation causes more than 1,200 deaths of children under five every single day. That's more than AIDS, measles, and tuberculosis combined. Although the flushed toilet and central sewer systems are considered by many to be the gold standard for safe sanitation, the solutions enjoyed by developed countries cannot simply be scaled down for poorer nations. Therefore, innovators around the globe are developing locally appropriate alternatives that can be safer, more cost effective, and more environmentally friendly, often, an individual visionary can move faster and more effectively than any government, like this man, who has developed a solution to sanitation for some of the world's poorest people. I grew up in the slums. And growing up in the slums is you come across sanitation challenges everyday. Everyday when I go to bed and before I wake up is like how can I make sure my brother, my sister, my cousin who is still facing sanitation challenge has a different life. Dixon's company Sanivation is a truly local solution to a global problem, providing home toilets and waste treatment for 20,000 people in Kenya in an economically sustainable way. We have 126 homes that we've been serving for the last three plus years. And we are really excited to see the impact we make into these families week after week, month after month, years after years. Initially, we used to have a shared toilet that was used by the entire plot. And it was unsafe because most people are using and it's unclean, so it's not safe for me and my children. And right now, I have a blue box that I can use at any time and it's also secure because I can use it in the house. I'm so happy right now because my family's safe. Sanivation collects human waste once weekly, employing 98 local workers to transport these materials to their centralized treatment facility. But Dixon isn't satisfied with simply offsetting the spread of disease. He's turning waste into a windfall. Once it gets here, our first step is treating it with our technology that we just harness the sun and ensure all the pathogens are killed. After that, it goes to the next stage where we mix it agriculture residue. And after that, we have a product that is from feces. And it can be used as a replacement for the traditional charcoal. With this charcoal, there's no carbon emission compared to the original charcoal. It burns three times longer than the traditional charcoal. That saves money. On top of that, for every ton of this charcoal sold, 88 trees are saved. The sale of the products we make cover the operation costs, so that makes our model very attractive and a good option to the government. Sanivation is partnering with the local government to expand their reach across Kenya and beyond. This kind of partnership is crucial to expanding the impact of innovations like The Water Box, Majik Water, and Sanivation. But recovery of resources from water and sanitation are not just important in the developing world. Creative solutions are equally important in cities like Chicago, home to the largest water treatment plant on Earth. A city of three million residents where millions of gallons of waste water are discharged every single day. We get about 750 million gallons of water per day on average. We could fill an Olympic size swimming pool in about 12 minutes. One of the pollutants that we want to remove from the water is phosphorous because in excessive quantities, phosphorous in the waterway encourages algae to grow and other water plants. And if you have too much algae and too much water plants, it can clog the waterway. While an excess of phosphorous damages aquatic ecosystems, the element itself is a key component of DNA, making it essential to all living things. But phosphorous is a finite resource that is disappearing fast. Scientists fear that there could be a global shortage of phosphorous as early as 2035. What if we could remove a pollutant from waste water and mine the valuable ore of pure phosphorous? Short answer? We can. Phosphorous is bound up in the organic material which we separate from the water. When it comes out the end, it's kind of soupy so we have to draw the water out of that. And when we pull the water out, the water is very concentrated in ammonia and phosphorous. Now, if we take that stream, and doing a little bit of chemistry magic, add a little bit of magnesium chloride to that, turn it into a product now using some commercial fertilizer methods. And now we have a product that can be sold as an agriculture fertilizer. Only, it's not just like any fertilizer. It's not just something that you would substitute for any other fertilizer because it's a slow release fertilizer. What's better than turning a waste into a resource? And one that you can make money off of. There's a revenue stream for this. This is a commercial fertilizer. It's sold and we get a piece of the profit. The cruel irony of wastewater treatment is that there's actually more than twice as much energy in the wastewater as what you would need to be able to treat it. And so why are we putting so much energy into something to destroy the energy that's there? That's essentially what we're doing. It's crazy. We have these tremendous amounts of resources just flowing through our pipes. It's free. And then we're spending a ton of money to get rid of it. Perhaps we need to completely rethink the concept of waste. As they say, one man's trash is another man's treasure. While Chicago prevents the overgrowth of algae by removing phosphorous from this wastewater, one maverick thinker in Southern Spain is deliberatively encouraging the formation of algae, harvesting a simple yet overlooked resource. Well, algae is actually the oldest organism on Earth because they survive with three little things. The sunshine, the nutrients, and the water. Here, we create our own algae. Rather than waiting for a million years, we do it in three hours. We have big basins we call raceways. That's where the algae grow. We keep it in there for three days. We feed them with wastewater. With flotation, we separate the algae from the water and pump it into the digestor where it gets converted into biogas or methane once we add the gas purification steps. Nobody would believe how much oxygen algae can actually produce. And that oxygen from algae helps us to clean the wastewater so that we have clean water at the end and what we have enough algae that we can harvest and use for biofuel. Toilet to tank is really what we're doing here. It was always my dream. I'm a car guy and I'm passionate about cars. I can take my wastewater, put it in my car, and drive off into the sunshine. We could put these algae ponds all over Andalusia. It would be enough to fuel 30 million cars in Spain with bio-methane. We can actually change the world little by little, step by step. This kind of lateral thinking is also being applied to the problem, supplying fresh water in many different ways. Just as Majik Water imitated the Namibian beetle, other innovators are turning to nature for ideas to solve our water problems. Imitating nature in this way is called biomimicry. Basically what we do now is we go out and find water of sufficient quality. We treat it a little bit as we need it. We use it and then we throw it away. Nature doesn't do that. Nature recycles every drop of water on the planet. The water we have today is the water we've always had. And that water has been reused and recycled by nature for billions of years. Attempting to replicate nature's own recycling process, scientists in Denmark looked for an answer deep inside the cells of our own bodies. They discovered a protein that can be accelerated and adapted into a membrane technology to purify water. Peter showed up in my lab one day as a graduate just after graduating with his little vial. He always carries around his little vial of aquaporin proteins. An average human has between say 40 and 50 different variations of aquaporin proteins in their body. They perform very important functions of regulating the flow of different materials. Think about what it would be like if you ate food or drank coffee, if that immediately went into your brain and had a stimulating effect on your brain, you'd kinda go crazy every time you drank a cup of coffee. And so your body has developed ways of regulating the flow of these different molecules in your body and an important part of that are the aquaporin proteins. So that's an example where we've taken this biological entity, this biological protein, integrated it into a membrane. We actually reused nature's way of filtrating water. Using biotechnology, we take out this small aquaporin protein that filtrates water in all living cells, which is extremely efficient. It's not something we have developed. It's something that nature has developed through 3.8 billon years of evolution. We just stand on the shoulders of that evolution. One gram of this aquaporin protein can filtrate 700 liters of water each second. And so we coat the surface of a membrane with this aquaporin protein and then we get more natural water and we can also instead of filtrating water, we can actually extract water by forward osmosis. We can open the doors for an entirely new range of filtration products with this component that nature has given us. Membrane technologies such as the aquaporin protein are also being employed to make dramatic leaps in our ability to extract freshwater from our oceans. Seawater by the name is highly saline. And to push salinity out of water, you need a lot of energy. And seawater is one of the most costliest water that you can get. In terms of next innovations, in terms of seawater treatment, that's exactly where we are. We were talking about 40 kilowatt hours per meter cube of water treated in the 1960s, '70s. Now, we are talking about less than four kilowatt hours per meter cube which is a 90% reduction in energy for the same seawater treatment. We are looking at technology which is half that further. We have an incredible array of exciting innovations today at our disposal that we did not have 20 or 30 years ago. We can create biomaterials from wastewater. We can turn wastewater into energy. We can purify water at a molecular level to do things that we could have only dreamed of doing a few decades ago. At a leading water research center in Singapore, membrane technologies are also being employed to make dramatic leaps in our ability to extract freshwater from our oceans. While advancements in desalination will continue, perhaps a simpler solution may be closer to hand, reusing the water we already have. On the Pacific Coast of California, massive overuse of water due to population increase and industrial demands has caused record scarcities, sounding an alarm to the state that the old way of diverting water to the region is no longer a viable option. In Southern California, we have a very dry climate. We've become accustomed to a certain amount of lifestyle and water usage, relying upon outside sources of water, namely from Northern California and from the Colorado River through aqueducts that were put in decades ago. When we started looking forward, we knew that population was gonna increase and outside sources are affected by the same drought here. The Colorado Aqueduct transports water from the Colorado River to Southern California. The transport of water is extremely energy intensive, costly, and now, unable to supply California's current demands. This used to be a heavily agricultural area. It's called Orange County for a reason. It was full of orange groves, soybean fields. There's a long time perception not just in California but in a lot of the U.S. that when you use groundwater, it's kind of a natural source. It's usually free from contamination. It's very good quality water. That it will just replenish itself, right? Nature will do that for you. Rain, precipitation. It'll eventually recharge itself to the point where we can just keep using it. But natural precipitation is not enough. We can't rely upon nature alone. We thought where else could we look? So there's manmade ways that we can recharge the aquifer to keep it sustainable, so that's when we thought okay, let's take on this wastewater. Mehul's team worked hard to persuade the government that using recycled water to refill the aquifers would enable Orange County to future proof their supplies and avoid another drought. This membrane technology's very good at removing contaminants and purifying water that was once thought unable to be treated. The great part about putting it underground is we lose virtually nothing. We actually lose more, when you see a large reservoir or a lake, you love a good 5% to evaporation. You almost have a natural protective cap keeping it free from environmental contaminants, and so it's kind of nature's perfect storage bowl. We kind of hit the geological jackpot by having this large natural underground aquifer that as long as we take care of it, can sustain all of our population. Of course, in many parts of the world, large cities are continuing to deplete groundwater levels. While governments struggle to get a handle on the problem, that's where industry can step up. Mexico City, with its population of 20 million people, is literally sinking under its own weight, causing roads and buildings to crumble. Relying on governments to solve the problem isn't enough. To make a major impact worldwide will require the progressive engagement of some of the world's biggest users of water. Industries need to rise up to bring this in the center of the agenda, invest in technologies to reuse water or recycle water, save water so that the future generations are not in a bad place. Industrial production frequently involves water usage on a massive scale. Whilst the cosmetics industry isn't the biggest offender, innovation and processes here have begun that could influence water usage in many areas of manufacturing. Because cleaning equipment between cycles is the most water intensive part of production, it is here where the cosmetics company L'Oreal have made the most change. I think for us, it's a company. Water is important because we need it to operate effectively. And in the areas where water is critical, we have to do all what we can to reduce our impact on these communities, on these regions by water using. So we have to reduce our water. We started with water efficiency to reduce our water needs, then to reduce water that we cannot reuse, and then to recycle. And we saw that water efficiency is not enough, so we started to think what can we do? And it was so obvious because we discharge it wastewater. In nature, no water is wasted. We picked this as our resource for freshwater to replace city water. Then we came up with recycling projects. At the end of 2018, we had about 12 plants already running with recycling. Based on these positive experiences with the recycling systems, we wanted to push the system a little further and we developed the concept of dry factory. Dry factory means that 100% of the water needs for an industrial process is covered by the reuse of treated and recycled water. No city water is now necessary for this purpose, cutting down on water consumption dramatically. Now, we are rolling out the dry factory concept with priority to high water consuming factories and factories operating in regions where water is a critical issue like here in Mexico. If industry follows this leadership, the global water consumption for manufacturing could be drastically reduced by as much as 90%, depending on the type of industry. We don't have the choice. We have to reduce our environmental impact. There is not a plan B. Everyone has to be aware and to contribute. Cosmetic manufacturing is only one of many water intensive industries. For example, textile companies like those in India are some of the largest consumers of water. And many of them have been major contributors to regional pollution. Poisoning water with dyes, bleaches, and other chemicals, and leaving their citizens without usable water. In 2010, the government demanded that all dyeing and bleaching units must either clean up or close up, threatening 55,000 jobs. One textile factory owner in Southern India rose to the challenge, discovering a sustainable solution and setting an example for other factories in the region. In 2010 and all, there was a heavy problem related to effluent. There was untreated effluent which was discharged. The rivers were in color. Because of dyeing factories and chemical factories chemicals were discharged into the Noyal river. If we walked into the river, we would get all sorts of diseases. Our feet and legs would be in pain and have a burning sensation Now, we are putting on continuous efforts and our technologies are getting updated. The river which was colored two decades ago, now, it is all fresh and clean. And now, it is a total zero discharge unit. Water from the dyeing process including bleach, chemicals, and salts is now treated instead of being flushed into local waterways. And instead of taking water from the rivers, Rahul's company is reusing over 90% of its textile processing water. Now the situation is much better compared to even five years back Effluent from our factory which has brine in it, colors in it, salts in it, that is taken to a plant wherein it is stored for about 24 hours in the bio. There, it is all treated. It is taken to the softening plant and then to the membrane. From the membrane, we get all the reused water. And the reject from that is taken to the evaporator wherein we get the salt of the crystallization. The water from the membrane and the salt from the evaporator is used here. Ninety percent of the water is returned. Everyone is participating together. The chemical, the dyer, and the membrane suppliers, so it is all in a chain that we are developing ourselves. We are trying to keep our industry environment friendly. I think it is high time now that everyone will have to realize and start doing it. No one can dodge with this anymore. In another part of India, the problem wasn't pollution but supply. In 2019, a city of 10 million people experienced what was once unthinkable, but is now becoming increasingly common, day zero, when a city simply runs out of drinking water. Everyone is after one thing only in Chennai and that is water. Chennai is facing a lot of water crisis. Last year, we didn't have rains at all. Groundwater is not there and rainwater is not treated properly and it's not connected to all the sources. And many apartments have to rely on tankers to supply them for water. Recently, there was a water tanker strike for four or five days. They are left without having any water. - Day by day, it is getting worse, so people need to just do something about it. Unlike most of Chennai's 10 million locals who were desperate for water in the face of this crisis, the almost 200 families in this Chennai apartment are not. How did these residents avoid purchasing costly water from tankers? Resourcefulness. See, as a teenager, I've never thought about it much. But as a mother, I want to give important things like clean water to my kid. We went door to door explaining why we should have rainwater harvesting and how it is supposed to be done. Now, they're all trained up. Everybody's doing that. As a committee of commitment, we decided that we are not going to buy a single drop of water. So we have decided we are going to upgrade our sewage treatment plant. We are going to upgrade our water treatment plant. We are going to upgrade our rain harvesting system. It all goes through the rain harvesting trenches and it will lead to the well so that we are using the water within our complex. All this "upgradeation," well, it has given us a fantastic result. You can see behind me, there is a beautiful large green garden. You may be thinking from where you are getting this much water to make this greenery? Absolutely, this is not here groundwater. This is water which we reused from the sewage treatment plant, so it looks lush and green. When I look through my window, seeing all the other communities close by, I wonder if they have the same water management system as we do here in our community that would help solve all the water crisis problems. We feel every drop of water is so valuable and we are not letting it waste. It's a win-win situation. Once you start to deal with water more locally, and that's a systems level change, not a technology change, you reduce the capital costs and you make it much easier to reuse that water. I go back to the issue of scarcity. Water reuse, we believe, is one of the smartest most efficient ways for us to deal with that issue. So more and more of the landscape is moving into indirect reuse and going to full water recycling. In California, we saw water conservation at a municipal scale. And in India, we saw Chennai residents of the building complex taking water supply into their own hands. But could that be scaled down even further? Absolutely. Here in the Netherlands, a group called the Dutch Water Alliance has introduced groundbreaking technology that allows us to recycle water right inside our own homes. You see in industry, measures are being taken to use less water. You see it in agriculture. And so now, it's up to us and consumers. And we're wasting so much water and it's so easy because the water source is already at our house. The Hydraloop is a residential gray water recycling system, so it recycles water from bath, shower, and washing machine, purifies it so it can be reused again for toilet flushing, washing machine, garden, and swimming pool. We've created a very new and innovative way of cleaning the water. We're using six existing techniques. We've combined them into one. And they're all very simple techniques, and altogether, they treat the water in such a way that is clean, clear, and safe, and it's actually certified to the highest international standards so it can be reused again. Within once month, we saved up to 3,000 liters of water. And that's a lot of water actually. And so annually, we save up to 30,000 liters of water. It is our vision that in 20 years time, no house shall be built without its own residential water recycling. I think if we don't start living sustainable and also water is a part of that, it will be a disaster in the end for the whole world I think. In 10 years time, there will be 8.5 billion people on this planet. And if only 5% of those will be recycling their water in house, it will actually stop the growth of water uptake on this planet. That really is the power of residential water recycling. Five, four, three. Many innovations in water filtration were developed for applications far away from the blue planet we seek to preserve. To deliver water to the International Space Station is very, very expensive. It's tens of thousands of dollars per liter to get it up there. Water recycling's a big part of NASA's program. For instance, on the International Space Station right now, the only sources of water are recycled urine and recycled humidity condensate which is the water in your breath that you generate from eating foods. We've developed some technologies that are associated with mimicking the function of your small intestine. We look at how does that work? How does that small intestine have this sort of regenerative capability? And then we go into the laboratory. We use genetic engineering and a variety of other techniques and applying it to making membranes to recycle the water. Five, four, three. You could bring a cup of water and that's all you would ever need. You could just recycle it around, and around, and around again. We have a lift off! Tower clear! It's truly inspiring to see these innovators often with very limited resources saving their communities and helping to stem the water crisis tide. But we can't simply leave the solutions to the experts, the engineers, the innovative visionaries. We all have a responsibility to act and to act now to create this Brave Blue World. If we can look for the beacons and the examples where people are already doing this and it's working, that's what's encouraging. And then it's simply a question of adopting and accelerating that adoption faster. And a lot of what needs to happen is simply we have to think differently and embrace those new ideas. And that's down to each of us. For some of us, action might take the form of pressuring local utilities to be more progressive in their approach to water supply and sanitation. For others, it might be applying our talents to become part of the solution. So ask yourself, what can I do today to be part of the solution? The answers are all around us. We can be more mindful of our own water usage and that of our family and friends. We can research new technologies like the ones we have just seen and apply them in our home, workplace, and community. We can support companies showing leadership in water management and we can encourage brands we care about to rethink their water policies. We can pressure our local, regional, and national governments to take tangible action. Letters, emails, petitions, social media campaigns. These things can make an immediate and lasting difference. This is a solvable problem, right? We know what the answers are. We've tested the answers, we've seen the answers out there. We know we can solve this problem. It's just a matter of putting together the business model, bringing all the pieces together, getting governments to provide the proper regulations to support to allow water recycling. I don't think it's technology that's holding us back from solving our water crisis. It has to do with finance, and politics, and policy. Banks control two-thirds of the world's money. If those banks made it a requirement for every loan that is made, that there has to be a water win at the back of that loan, what an amazing opportunity that could be. One simple sentence to the public about water is demand more, demand better. It's there. You know, it takes strong leadership to make decisions to go into areas that haven't been pursued before, but to do it because we know that it's the right thing. It's the right thing for our society. It's the right thing for our environment. It's the right thing for the future of humanity. For some of us, action might simply take the form of recognizing the ineffable value of water and being willing to pay the price for such a precious resource, even in regions where water appears to be plentiful. Just as climate change has sparked grassroots activism across the planet, the water crisis too requires massive mobilization of people who truly care about our shared future. I think quite frankly, we create a movement amongst the younger generation and they will simply not tolerate that we do things as status quo. Each positive step we take, every innovation we employ, every progressive policy initiative we enact moves the needle further and further away from catastrophe. This can happen in our lifetime. This has to happen in our lifetime or we are looking at a very different world for our children. We want to see the government committed in putting in money and supporting sanitation to be a reality to everyone. We envision a day when everybody has access to clean water and sanitation, and we envision that in our lifetime. We're on the brink of being hopeless, but we're not there yet. And if we really come together, we can make a difference. And if you look at these people that are doing amazing things around the world, you start to be inspired 'cause you're like we can make a difference. Like how lucky are we that we're the ones who get to solve this?
