(Candy wailing) (tense music) - Hey, take it easy baby. If your old man's generous you'll be home for dinner.

(hand slaps) (water splashing) And when I come back those fingernails had better be clean. (door slams) (soap thuds) (door slams) - Synchronize watches. Remember, two minutes. Okay, mark it. - Sean, hold still! This is the first time your father's boss has ever asked us to dinner, and do you know what that means? His own territory. But you are going to have to be extra special. Do you understand me? (Audrey groans) (footsteps thudding) - Hey big fella. How you doin'? Not now Champ. Dad's got to wack off the whiskers. (door latches) (playful music) (gate creaking) (gentle music) - Sock it to him. (gentle music) Is that her old man? - [Eddy] Brown suit. - [Alan] Good. - Thank you. - [Man] The way you do business might start a new trend. - Possibly. (gentle music) (patrons chattering) - We're late. (birds chirping) (gravel rustling) - We have to go. (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (coin clattering) (phone dinging) (phone ringing) - Hello. Mr. Phillips? One moment, please. (receiver thuds) - It was my intention. - Telephone. - Thank you. Excuse me. (patrons chattering) (footsteps thudding) This is Avery Phillips. - Listen carefully. You will take every diamond in the store two carats or bigger and put them in your briefcase. - Who is this? - Don't talk, listen. We've got your daughter. Taped to the rear door of the store you will find a map telling you where to leave the briefcase. It will take you exactly 38 minutes to get there. We're giving you two minutes leeway. If you ever wanna see Candy again, I suggest you don't waste those minutes calling the police. Remember, if your daughter dies, she's on your conscience, not ours. - Wait a... (line clicks) (pensive music) (patrons chattering) (pensive music) (doors slamming) - Wait. (pensive music) (patrons chattering) (pensive music) - Did he say anything? - No. Let's go. (pensive music) (jewelry clattering) - Howard? You go on home. I think Mr. Stoddard's coming in in the morning and I want to uh, look over the trays myself. - Well, thank you Mr. Phillips. - [Avery] Lisa? Go into my office and write down my appointments for tomorrow morning. I wanna know exactly what I have. - Write? - Yes, write. - Yes, Sir. (pensive music) (brakes squealing) (door slams) - [Jessie] How'd it go? - Like a Greek watch. (engine revving) (gate clanging) - I might be a little late. - And for God sake's Dudley, promise me you will not eat with your mouth open. If there's one thing I can't stand it's you when you eat with your mouth open. - Jesus. - What are you gonna tell me, you don't eat with your mouth open? - Drop it Audrey. - All right. But people notice. (groovy music) - God damn! I actually think we're gonna pull this thing off. - [Eddy] Right on time (laughs)! - Does he know about my mother's house in Laguna? - I've never even talked to the man. - [Audrey] Well, I don't think it would hurt to mention it. - Don't you ever do that when I'm driving! Ever! (Dudley sighs) I could kill somebody. (Eddy laughs) (groovy music) - The perfect crime. (Jessie giggles) (eerie music) - Dear? Did Candy ever get a hold of you? - [Katherine] What? - Candy called. She's spending the night at a friend's house. (eerie music) Katherine? - [Katherine] I'm cutting patterns, dear. I'll be down in a minute. (eerie music) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (door slams) - Books. Binoculars. (birds chirping) Rye crisps. - Rye crisps? - Bird watchers love it. Move out. (birds chirping) - [Eddy] You got the drop point? - [Jessie] Yeah. He's not there yet. (liquid sloshing) - Avery? Avery? Have you seen my glass? (Avery laughs) - It's right here, dear. - Uh, why didn't Candy call me? (eerie music) - She tried. Your line was busy. - Oh. Well, what with the church bazaar coming up on Sunday there's so much to do. So many details. You know, if you knew how good these drinks are when you make them you would just... - Dear (sighs), I'm afraid I'm gonna be a little late again tonight. You know the damn Dutch and their cartels. (eerie music) I'd rather deal with the South African's anytime. - You've said that. (Dudley's boss chuckles) - Well, well (chuckles). I bet there's somethin' you're just dyin' to talk about, huh? Wait a minute, let me guess, huh? Now, uh, let me see now. You went out today? Huh? And you uh, saw something, huh? (Dudley's boss chuckles) Oh, kids love me. I can do anything with 'em, anything. Just watch this. Now, just exactly what did you see, huh? Well, come on, cat got your tongue? Come on, speak. Come on. - He doesn't um-- - Talk. - Talk, yes. - What do you mean he doesn't talk? All kids talk. - Not ours. There's um, some sort of problem. - Problem? You hear that mother? Kid doesn't talk. Whoever heard of a kid who doesn't talk (laughs)? (pensive music) (doorbell ringing) (pensive music) (door creaks) (pensive music) (helicopter engine whirring) - [Eddy] The cops! - It's the fire department. Don't worry about it. - How do you know? - 'Cause it's red. Police is blue. Blue uniforms, blue caps, blue cars, blue helicopters. Blue everything. Everybody knows that. - The drop! Nobody's watchin' the drop! (birds chirping) What if we missed them? (upbeat music) - [Alan] He made it. (Jessie exhales) Cross your fingers. Nothing. - Maybe he had a flat tire or somethin'. It happens. Oh, he's just got to come Alan, he's just got to. We give him 10 more minutes. - Yeah. We owe him that much. He mighta had trouble getting the diamonds. - [Avery] Close your eyes. - [Lisa] Closed. (upbeat music) - Open. - For me? - That depends. (upbeat music) - Avery, I know what that's worth. - You just think you do. It has a flaw (chuckles). (upbeat music) - Avery, I'm just putty in your hands. (upbeat music) (Avery moans) - [Eddy] I'd like to get my hands on that son of a bitch. - God damn it! Son of a bitch! Shit! Shit! God damn it! Three weeks! Three weeks I spent memorizing red breast and ditch diggers! God damn it! (upbeat music) - How would you like to go to Rio? - What? - Rio de Janeiro. South America. (Avery's fingers snapping) (upbeat music) Cha cha cha. - What would we do in Rio? - Same thing we do here, but with more sun on it. - Do you know how much I wanted my own territory? Do you know how much I wanted that? Yes. You know, when he was two years old, I said send him to a psychiatrist. Oh no. It's too expensive, it's too expensive. Well I tell you Audrey, it would've been money well spent. (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) - All right out, come on, out. Now, I want you to go into the house, go straight to your room, put on your pajamas and get into bed. (Audrey panting) I don't ever want to see you again! (Candy whimpering) - [Alan] Make sure that blindfold's tight. - Go break a window. We take her to the house. (gentle music) (door creaking) - Do you know what you did to us tonight? Well, you're going to pay for it! Go on! How far do you think you can go? I told you to put on your pajamas and you didn't! I told you to go to bed and you didn't! You are never ever going to disobey me again! (hand slapping) - You want a hamburger? Uh, you need to... Gotta go to bathroom? - Yes. (footsteps thudding) - She's got to go to can. - [Jessie and Alan] So? - Okay. (crickets chirping) (Candy whimpering) - [Candy] Are you gonna kill me? - [Eddy] Holy Christ. - You are. You are (sobbing)! - No. No. We, we're not going to kill you, I promise. (Candy sobbing) - Why should I believe you? - Because you don't know what we look like, okay? (Candy sobs) - Then what are you gonna do with me? - You think I know? I mean, we never got this far. We got to figure it out. (floorboard creaks) - Bedtime stories? Doesn't make sense. Why didn't the son of a bitch bring the diamonds? Doesn't make sense. - Because he didn't think we would kill her. That's the only possible answer. - Maybe he did have a flat tire. - Maybe nothing. He didn't think we'd kill her, period. (liquid sloshing) - Then we got to find a way to show him we mean business. - Exactly, as we're gonna take another shot at him. (Eddy sighs) Unless of course everybody's decided to go out tomorrow and find a job. - Work for the man? Not me. - Wanna convince him? (knife clicks) Tell ya what you do. We cut off her ear. (Candy gasping) With one of those pretty little earrings. We send it to him in a box. - What? - We cut off her ear and we send it to him in a box. - You're out of your mind. - I got to admit it would work. (Jessie laughs) (Candy screaming) Daddy? - No! - [Jessie] Call for Daddy! - No! - Say it bitch! (Candy screaming) God damn it. Give me the knife. (Candy sobbing) It's okay little darling. Now you got one chance. Let's hear it. Daddy? - Daddy help me! Help me, they're gonna cut off my ear! Help, they're gonna cut off my ear! Help me. Help me. Help me (sobbing). - [Jessie] How was that? - [Candy] Daddy! Help me! Help me, they're gonna cut off my ear! Help, they're gonna cut off my ear (sobbing)! Help me. Help me. Help me. - Good. (Candy screaming) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing? (Candy whimpering) - I'm gonna cut her ear off. - No way. No way. It's my knife. (Candy sobbing) I do it. Here. (Candy sobbing) Now hang on. - No! No, no, no (sobbing)! - Aw, lemme see. Should I cut from the bottom up or-- - [Eddy] No! (tense music) (Jessie laughs) (Alan laughs) - Hey man, you didn't really think that, that we... All we wanted was the tape, right? - What good's the tape without the ear? (knife clicks) (Candy sobbing) - Help yourself. - No, no, no, hey, there are easier ways to get an ear, if you've got the right connections. - You want a ear? - Yeah. - Jessie, what in the hell you want a ear for? - Aw, come on Charlie. You gonna give it to us or not? - What's it worth to ya? - $10. - $10? At 10 o'clock I sold a finger for 35. Ain't no way man. Ain't no way. ♪ No way baby ♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪ No way ♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪ No way baby ♪ Ain't no way baby - Okay, 35. ♪ I can't see it ♪ I knew it's got to be worth more more than a finger ♪ What's a little finger, baby - 40. ♪ Can't see it Jessie ♪ Jessie, you jivin' ♪ You got to be jivin' me ♪ Oh, Charlie come on ♪ I can't, I can't do it - 50. - Yeah, okay. (tense music) - Um, we need a girl. - What's the matter, Jessie? (Charlie smirks) These are the best people in the world. They don't hurt nobody. They don't make no trouble. They don't tell me what to do. They don't cost no money. They mind their own business. Yes, all they do is lie there, and just think about all them people. It's too late to fuck. - Too old. - Man, an ear's an ear. - Well not for 50 bucks it isn't. (Charlie chuckles) (Charlie's tongue clicks) - Uh, fine. (knife clicks) (tense music) (tools clattering) - 50 bucks. - And for another five? - Money. It's nothin' personal. We just want some money. - But my father's not rich. He just manages the store. He doesn't own it. - Baby, he takes the diamonds out and puts 'em back in the safe. You figure it out. - Oh. Is it this important? Money? - That uniform you're wearin', you like it? - No. I think it's kinda stupid. - Yeah? (Eddy chuckles) I wore a uniform in the Army. When the sergeant said move, I moved. Then I got outta the Army and I went to work for a furniture company. It was a different uniform. But when the boss said move it, I moved it. One day, one day he came up to me, and he said, "Eddy? "You're doin' me a hell of a job. "And to show my appreciation, "I'm gonna put your name on your next pair of coveralls. "How 'bout that, huh?" I hit him in the mouth. And never got another job. - You can make something of yourself. Everybody can. (Eddy smirks) Lotsa people do it. - I'm not lotsa people. - Lotsa people aren't criminals. - Criminal? You got a lotta nerve. Anyway, when this is all over I'm gonna have enough money to buy me a bowling alley. That's what I've always wanted, a bowlin' alley. Bar, good bar. Just enough light, you know? Moody. (Eddy chuckles) And I'll have a couple of kids set pins. Two or three hookers. You watch. I'm gonna be set for life. I'm gonna be my own boss. (gentle music) Gonna work my ass off. Pay taxes. (Eddy chuckles) Who knows? Someday I might even join a Chamber of Commerce. - And the others, what will happen to them? - Uh, Jessie's little brother's gonna FO and uh, she's gonna come with me. - And she's a girl? - Of course she's a girl. What ya think? - Well, in the beginning I was pretty sure, but then she was telling everybody else what to do. What's she like? - She's the kind of a girl you get your hands on only in a dream. You've had dreams like... (gentle music) No. No I guess you haven't. She has blue eyes and she's built like a brick pagoda. - You're in love with her aren't you? - Who me? - You're in love with her. And I'll never even know what it is. - Don't say that. - You're gonna kill me. - No. - Oh my God! I know it even if you don't. - Hey. (gentle music) Trust me. Trust me. (gentle music) (footsteps thudding) - [Alan] Christ. Beauty and the Beast. - Did you get it? (ear thuds) - Uh, wake me in the morning. I'm gonna sleep in the van. - Take the ear. - Jessie, I'm not gonna sleep with that ear. - Take it. - What's wrong with the bench? - You want the ants to get it? (footsteps thudding) Thank you. (crickets chirping) (handle clinking) (crickets chirping) Do you mind? - You know, Jessie, since we, just, we got hung up here you know? And what with everything goin' on, we haven't had much of a chance to get acquainted. - Some other time. - [Eddy] No, now. - Get out of my way. (Eddy chuckles) - You are two walnuts and 100 pounds short of tellin' me what to do and you better get used to that. - You think so? - It takes more than wearing pants and drinkin' out of a bottle. A lot more. - Get out of my way! (Eddy chuckles) Get out of my way! Get out of my way! (Eddy laughs) (tense music) - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - Eddy? - [Eddy] Oh yeah. - No. - [Eddy] No? No? (tense music) No? Hell, you all say no! - I said no! (hand slaps) (tense music) (Jessie groans) (gentle music) - [Jessie] Alan! - [Eddy] Jessie? (gentle music) - [Jessie] Alan! - [Eddy] Jessie? (gentle music) - Give me that money! I don't wanna be me anymore. I wanna be somebody else. Getting on a plane to New York with a mink coat and do anything, anything except go to bed with every third guy I meet, just to get through the world, just to get through the night (sobbing). Can't you understand that? - Sure. I understand. But you, you said it was gonna be just you and me Jessie. You said that Jessie. - Oo! And you believed it? - Yeah, I believed it. I believed it. How 'bout that, huh? (tense music) Now you, you! You're gonna believe it! - No (sobs)! No baby, oh! No, baby not today! Leave it! (tense music) (Eddy panting) God! God! - "Hail Mary, full of grace. "Blessed art thou among women." (Eddy panting) (Jessie panting) (Candy groaning) (head thudding) (birds chirping) (Candy yelling) No! No! (Candy yelling) - Shut up! (Candy screaming) We need a gag. - [Eddy] What are you doin'? (Candy screaming) - We're putting her back in the hole. - [Eddy] No! - Shut up! - Oh, please don't put me back in the hole! - Shut up! - You don't know what it's like! No! - Shut up! - No! Leave her alone. - What the hell do you care? We're gonna kill her anyway. - Hey, we agreed that there wouldn't be-- - We agreed to get the diamonds. We did not agree on her. - Okay! Okay. Then kill her. (Candy panting) Get it over with. Now. (birds chirping) (footsteps thudding) (Candy screaming) (knife clicks) - God damn. It's a pity you can't see this coming. (dramatic music) - Outside. (tense music) (hand patting) (tense music) (engine rumbling) (tense music) - Kidnapping is life (chuckles), and you're worried about stealing a truck (laughs)? - It's so stupid! - Is it? We tried it her way and it didn't work. Now we do it my way or we call it off. - Okay. But you go in there and he's gonna see you. - Yeah, me. Not you. Anyway uh, he won't have any time to do anything about it. The key to this operation is daring and surprise. - Right on. You're gonna surprise him, 50 cops and the FBI. Good thinking. - We're talkin' about half a million bucks! Or did you forget that? Now is it worth taking a chance or isn't it? - Yeah, but just walkin' in there with an ear. - Well how in the hell did you figure on getting it to him, huh? Parcel post? (tablet fizzing) - Mm. (tablet fizzing) Thank you, dear. This bazaar just has me a nervous wreck. (throat clears) - Um, Candy dropped by. Picked up a notebook or something and went on to school. (tablet fizzing) She sent ya that. - You're so good to us, dear. Mm. (phone man whistling) - How you doin'? - Hi. - You by yourself? - Yeah, I got to put all new lines in. - Hm. How long you gonna be? - Oh, I don't know. About noon. Why? (knee thuds) (phone man grunting) (fists thudding) (men grunting) (plank thudding) (phone man groaning) (tense music) - Next time, could we find a smaller phone man? (gentle music) - And where do you think you're going? You are not getting up until you finish that cereal. And when you finish you will go to your room and pick up every one of your toys and put them away. And at nine o'clock I am going to come in and every toy I see I will break and throw in the garbage. Now, do you understand me? Good. (upbeat music) (engine rumbling) - You know, he's getting to be a real pain in the ass. - You're tellin' me? - He's gonna blow the whole thing before it's over. (Alan exhales) You know that. You don't think he's gonna let us kill the girl, do you? I mean uh, now she knows our names, our voices. She's got to go Jessie. (upbeat music) (tries squealing) (pensive music) (door slams) (gate rattling) (footsteps thudding) - We won't be open for 10 minutes. - Lady, you've got trouble on the line and uh, I've got to fix it. - [Lisa] I'll get the manager. (engine rumbling) - Can you do it? - Hm? - I mean, have you ever killed anybody? - Do you really wanna know? I've killed, 12. 12 people. - 12? - Mm hm. Yeah, I think the world's record is 279. Gee, I'd be happy to break 100. - Yes? - It's about your daughter. (lock clicking) - This way. (jewelry clattering) The uh, phone is in the back office. The phone is in the, in the back office. (jewelry clattering) Through there. (engine rumbling) - [Candy] Help me! Help me! Help me, they're gonna cut off my ear! Help, they're gonna cut off my ear (sobbing)! Help me! Help me! Help me! (box rattling) Oh my God. Oh my God, no! - Now, now you know we mean business, huh? So get yourself together, because you're gonna get up, you're gonna go into the next room, you're gonna get the diamonds, and you're gonna bring 'em back here. And if there's anymore problems, you daughter will be dead. Move it. - Where is she? - Don't worry about it, move it! Move it! - No. - No? (door thuds) - Oh uh, what is it Officer? - Is that your truck outside? - Uh, yes. - I know you guys can park where you damn well please, but I got a busy street out there. Would it really kill ya to put it around the corner? - Sure. Right, right away. Right away. - Oh uh, you forgot something. (footsteps thudding) - You still don't understand. We are going to kill her. - I was hoping you'd say that. I'm afraid you don't understand. You think you're the only one in the world who needs money (chuckles)? - Pardon me. - You really didn't do your homework, did you? Because if you had, you would've discovered that Candy is my stepdaughter, and that she once upon a time had a very rich father and if she reaches the age of 21, she will inherit roughly two million dollars. And if she doesn't, half of that money is mine, which is why I married her mother in the first place. Oh, I've been waiting for you, for something for almost 10 years. (eerie music) Thank you. Was there anything else? (pensive music) Have a nice day. - You too. (Avery whistling) (birds chirping) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (brakes squealing) (upbeat music) (Jessie gasps) - You scared me. Where are the diamonds? - Alan, where's Alan? - Where are the diamonds Eddy? - Where is Alan? - He's gone to kill the girl. Now where are the diamonds? - Oh, no! - [Jessie] Eddy, where the hell are the diamonds? - I don't have 'em! If she dies, we're never gonna have 'em. (engine rumbling) (playful music) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (doorknob rattling) (pensive music) (door creaking) (pensive music) - What do you want? Say something. (pensive music) Who are you? Untie me. (pensive music) Can you do it? (pensive music) Will you help me? You know about the hole? (pensive music) If they put me back in that hole, you mustn't try to dig me up yourself. No, no. All you have to do is get the police. It's very important. You can save my life. Do you know what killing is? - Pew. - If you don't get the police, they're going to kill me. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) Oh my God, if they catch you... (tense music) (knife clicks) (tense music) - You and me have had this date from the very beginning. Looks like you're gonna see it after all. (Candy groans) (Candy sobbing) (fabric ripping) (Alan laughs) (Candy sobbing) (hand slaps) (Candy sobbing) - No! (Candy sobbing) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) - Come on! I'll let go when you do. Come on. Oh, come on, come on. Come on. - Please don't, no! - Come on. - No! - Come on. - No! - Come on! (Candy gasping) Ah! (Candy gasps) (Alan panting) (Candy sobbing) (engine rumbling) (Alan grunting) (Candy sobbing) (Eddy grunting) (ladder clattering) (Alan thudding) - Get off of him! Eddy, Eddy you'll kill him! Eddy! (Eddy yells) (tense music) You are a pig. - What are you so uptight about? You want her to die a virgin? (gentle music) - You lied to me. - Everything's a lie. (gentle music) (alcohol sloshing) (pensive music) - Jessie? (pensive music) I hate to tell ya, this is turning into a career. (pensive music) - Can you believe it? We kill her and he gets a million dollars. A million dollars! - Mm hm. But if he can't find the body it's gonna take seven years to collect. (Jessie laughs) (pensive music) (footsteps thudding) (board clattering) (dramatic music) - The ladder! (upbeat music) Lift it up! (upbeat music) - [Alan] Give me your shoulder. (upbeat music) Come on, push! Higher. (upbeat music) Higher. Higher! - [Eddy] Ow! You're steppin' on my head! (upbeat music) (cat meowing) (birds chirping) (Eddy laughing) (birds chirping) (Jessie laughing) (Alan laughing) (birds chirping) (footsteps thudding) (objects thudding) (playful music) (Eddy sighs) - You asshole. You had to take that blindfold off. - She took it off herself. I didn't have to see her to bang her. I was workin' the other end, Champ. Well, who are you calling an asshole anyway? Either one of ya. Big sister. Great full proof scheme, right? Wrong. And you. (Alan chuckles) That daylight attack of yours, that was a sensation. (Jessie laughs) (Alan laughs) Now... Hey? (fingers snapping) We're gonna do things my way. The way we shoulda done 'em in the first place. Tonight, we're gonna stake him out, we're gonna grab him and either he gives us the diamonds or we cut his throat. - What about the girl? - Well you said it. The bitch took off her blindfold. - Put her back in the hole. - Wrong again. (gentle music) (playful music) (dial spinning) (phone ringing) - Maxie's Delicatessen, Maxie speaking.

Open up. - Look, if this is Herbie get me down for five on the nose. Fred Julie. Tomorrow on the fifth at Highalier. And if this is one of them smart Alec God damn jokers, you should shove a salami up your ass. (line clicks) - Shh. They're asleep. It'll be all over tonight.

I could give you the whole bottle but I won't. I'll just give you one. And between now and five o'clock in the morning, you are going to be down and out, and I am going to be up and alive. Now, swallow it. (saw grinding) (Katherine laughing) (Alan laughing) - Yeah. When we get our courage together, come on. Come on, come on.

Now, what do ya have to say to that? (gentle music) (door slams) (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) - You know, you've kept us waiting here for a very, very, very, long time. - It was you who really didn't understand.

Actually uh, it seems to me that uh, we might be able to help each other. - [Jessie] Alan? - Shut up. Go ahead. - Well, the point is that, it's very important for me to know whether my daughter is alive or dead. And of course, very important for me to know uh, where I can uh, find her.
