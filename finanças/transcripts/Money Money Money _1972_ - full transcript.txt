- Did he behave? - He tried to bribe me. - A good price, I hope. - The Revolution's broke. We'll show him how to get rich with a few phone calls. With late charges, it'll be $300,000. $200,000 for the ambassador and $100,000 for Juarez. $200,000 for the ambassador and $100,000 for Juarez? $300,000 for two kidnappings. A real bargain. Where's Juarez? In the shack, up there. - I see no one. - One second. Charlot, are you listening? Bring out Ernesto. Have him wave. Enough. He can go back in. You saw him? Now, give us the money. What if I refuse? Young man, you want Juarez alive? One second, please. Thanks a lot! Charlot! They're off and running! Bring Ernesto out. Have him wave. He can go back in. And if I refuse? You want Juarez alive? One second, please. Quick! - The pictures for our posters! - Lino'll paint some! We got it! Holy shit! Interesting. Politics isn't all bad. I wondered why people went into it. - Now I know. - They paid! - Call that chicken feed? - You too? Curly's getting mad. They've got problems up there! Look at the Yanks. $1,000 the Yanks get there first. - $2,000 on mine! - $3,000 on the Yanks. - I call you. - Three on the Yanks. - Why the Yanks? - Mine have no style. 5,000 on the Yanks, the capitalists. Mine look bad right now, but look at Curly! 10,000 on the Marxists! - 12 on the capitalists. - 15 on the Yanks! 15 each on the capitalists! I'll give you boys a break. 30 says I take you both. Okay? Damn fools! - You see that! - $30,000! The next war will be like that. One big bang! No one'll ever know who won. You know something? I liked Ernesto. The best man we've met. A man has to die to be appreciated. Another thing. He was straight. Coming or not? The money, Lino! We're rich! Are you sure you speak English? To perfection! - Where did you learn? - High school. - You went to high school? - Till eighth grade. Go on. Stop. - Was it good? - Fine. I think you'd better keep that. Aldo can't speak English, but he has a good accent. Paris traffic is bad, but so is New York's. "I speak fluent English." - Fluent! - I do! - We get to choose? - Of course! You're heartwarming in that skirt. It suits you well. - Do you have a magazine? - Right away, sir. You're overdoing it. My glasses. One second. Fluent! - Where were we? - We stopped there. Relax, Charlot. Next job in English, we send Jacques and Aldo. - It went fine. - We'll see in a little while. I've seen some good-looking broads. "Ate Daze"? Not listed. Nothing. Jacques said it was all here. No "Ate Daze," no "Wick." I'll take care of it. Let's sit down. - What'd you say? - I asked if we could wait. You're sure you said that? I'm sure. We're waiting, aren't we? Fine. How's my hat? My hat. The hat's fine, but the rest... Y'know, you really are heartwarming. - Oh, hello. - It's gloomy up here. Downstairs is gay and lively, but here it's gloomy. You're right. Would you like a drink? - Champagne! - I'll get it for you. I make 71,000 francs a month. - Interesting! - Belgian francs. You're Belgian? I work soil and beasts. - You work what? - Soil and beasts. - I'm an agricult! - Agriculturist. I'd like five glasses of champagne. - All for you? - For a small celebration. Where are the men who fly the plane? The pilots? Over there. Over there? We can't go see them? No visitors allowed because of the hijackings. The fifth glass. Better be safe than sorry! With all these imbeciles... Anything can happen. So they're over there, you say. - Aren't they bored? - Who gets these? I'll show you. Make sure no one hijacks the champagne! - What is it? - A passenger's treat. Evening, Captain. Thanks for your help. Don't you panic. We're used to it. - So are we. Altitude? - 8,000. Go up to 12,000 and keep circling to the left. Contact the president of the airline's insurance company. He has an urgent appointment with Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson. You speak French? Great! Put that away! Well, now... we've just heard that one of the planes you insure, a 747, to be exact, has been hijacked. It so happens, quite by incidentally, that we specialize in rescuing such planes. Two what? - Two million. - In what? Dollars, naturally. 10% - 10% of what? - Of the price of the plane. What if, unfortunately, they were to blow it up? 20 million is what you'd owe the airline. And you want these two million in cash. Naturally. - And at once. - Yes, that, too! And where do I find that much at this hour? That's your problem. You're the insurer! This lady next to me kept pestering me. "How do they fly at night and not get lost?" I said we'd ask the captain. So he told her, because I already knew. He said, "See the little green light on the tip of the left wing? And you see the little red light on the tip of the right wing? Well, we just fly between them!" Suppose I accept? Then it's all arranged. Don't worry. An hour from now, if we're not followed, we'll phone you a password to transmit to the pilot. And the plane will go beddy-bye in New York tonight. "Ginette's striptease isn't as good as Julie's." Perfect! And now please, turn off your radio. Say nothing and take me to Montreal. If you like, you can then go beddy-bye in New York. Are we rich?! We're rich, you know. How'll you spend it? I can't believe... I was a car thief, and now I've got billions! Millions! Maybe I don't have the build, but I have a right to dream, to have lofty thoughts sometimes. I always love other men's wives. - How do you get rid of them? - Get rid of them? It's easy. You tell them to go, and they go? Once I tell them, that's it. I can't fall in love. I can't. Do you know how much a girl costs? We've got money now! You never know what can happen. You've got to stay focused! He's going to hurt somebody! Lunge, Lino! Good. Ad out! Ad out. 117-love! Be courteous, gentlemen, or I'll stop the match. 11! Carrying anything? A little.38, why? I've got a fun job. Here? The casino cash-box leaves in 10 minutes. There'll be a driver and a guard. Let's have some fun. Just us two? Maybe our friend needs a laugh, too. Doing all right? "Our nature must always come out." What're you talking about? What was the point of starting a new career? You're going to blow off our vacation for a lousy $20,000! It's not for money, it's to have some fun! To kill time, Simon! Can't you just relax and do nothing? There goes our society of leisure! - You call this fun? - You're challenging the whole theory! Take Aldo and Charlot. They're enjoying themselves. Yours, mademoiselle? Want to knock over the casino cash-box? Fuck you! We're on vacation! Let me pick up the girl! Sure, this is how we'll pick up girls! Look at that fool! Looks like a train starting. That's walking! - Come on, you too! - Who walks like that? I always walk like that for the girls. Watch the way I move. Not like that, Simon! - The leg like that. - Smoother! You have to see it to believe it! That really does something for you! Terrific! That's how you pick up girls. - He's riding a bike! - Style and class! - Not like that! - Yes, like that! I taught him! I'll show you. - Italian-style! - Not like that! Like this! Smooth! Simon, watch! Let yourself go! Lino, how do you want the pasta? - What'd he say? - Tomato sauce. Show me where we are. We're there. - Where are we going? - There, to Haknan-Hwahwa. Is there an airport? At Haknan-Hwahwa? A small one. So, to Hakna-whatever. Aldo, the dog and I will take the plane. Because I can't stand any more vacation! But why stop at Haknan-Hwahwa? Just look at what's become of us! And look at him! He's sick! No, no! Paris, Paris, Paris! Lino, the tanning lotion! Charlot, give me a hand! You must've caught a whale! Easy! You nut, I was sunbathing! A Michelin 42/12. A Michelin 42/12, a very good snow-tire! - You've had too much sun! - It's not the sun. I know tires. Why did we rent a sailboat? If we had a boat with a motor, there'd be five girls here. Why a boat with sails? What's that? What's that? A friend of mine, a leftwinger, runs a summer holiday camp. He gives suntanning lessons. He told me there's a triangle right there, that nobody thinks about. Jacques, ever study suntanning? When do we turn in the boat? When do we turn in the boat? Are you being funny? I told you, Paris! Aldo! The girls! What'd I tell you about those girls? - What'd I tell you? - "Something's fishy." And here we are... going where? I know one thing: They're not cops. It's not the way they do things! "Yoo-hoo! Come have some pasta, come have some spaghetti!" He's right, you two are morons, animals! How many times... how many times have I told you girls mean trouble! - How many times? - Never! If we can't get broads, with all our money, what good is it? I like men, not so much because they're men, but because they're not women! I didn't see you two fighting off those girls! Who shut the door when you left Ernesto? - Aldo did. - You're sure? I was there. Mr. Ernesto, you know that... Jacques, you tell him. What'd I say about him? He said that... of all the men we'd met... General, you were the best. He said you were straight. I even added you were honest. Yes, that's right. Thank you very much. You know the procedure: One, kidnapping; two, ransom. I'll only ask for the $2 million from the plane. Give me your Swiss bank account number and you're free. So, what's the number? Mr. Ernesto, how did you find us? You're noticeable when you're on vacation. Your behavior isn't very Marxist. But you aren't Marxists. You're cheap hoodlums! Easy, there! I'll bet $1,000 he talks. $2,000, he doesn't. I'm with you, Jacques. Well? $2,000 he doesn't talk. $3,000, he does. $5,000. $10,000, he misses, and $20,000, he doesn't talk. Double that. What about that Swiss account number? Screw you. Screw you! I'm not as good a shot as you are. Screw you! Paper tiger! You're a paper tiger. Relax, it's phony. - What'd he say? - $10,000 he won't talk. - I'm in. - How much? $15,000. I won! - $15,000 he talks. - $15,000 he talks. I'll cover all three for $50,000, okay? Well, Mr. Bandit? The Swiss account. I don't remember. We'll see. Drop your pants. Drop your pants. Why should I drop my pants? You'll see. It's funny! Lino, try it! It's funny! It's funny, Ernesto! Does little Poupoune know Switzerland? - I've got an offer... - No! UBS in Zurich, 9461. Ask for Hugo Frichthafen, he'll take care of it. You are a humanist! Lt'll surprise Frichthafen! - But... - But what? - Ernesto, can I say... - Shut up! Go ahead, tell him in Italian! - Go f... - Very good, Lino. Juarez! I thought he was honest, and straight! He was a bastard! Know what he did? I gave him the number, and he took the $2 million. But that's not all! He pumped us dry! Took all the money we had! And that's not all. He turned us in to the police. And yes, to the French police! These men are not innocent, I know. But they are prophets! The innocent have full hands and light hearts. The accused have empty hands but their hearts are heavy with the threat of death! Where, Mr. Prosecutor, is their fortune? Do the accused have sumptuous villas by the sea? Or mansions in rich suburbs? No! They own nothing! They own nothing because they are fighting against a political system based on property! With all due respect, Mr. Prosecutor, the growing unrest in the world today, the solidarity strikes, the riots, add proof, if it's needed, this is a political trial! In fact, politics is on trial here! The real defendant is not sitting here today. The real defendant is our immoral modern world, its electoral chicanery, its tactical pacts and tactical wars! These men, the accused, have simply tried to blow up an unsanitary atoll called politics! He's oversimplifying. The system is not on trial here. The accused placed it on trial before I did. Not to oversimplify, but... The system is on trial here. Its survival may even depend on the verdict. We know the political opinions of the accused. If any doubt still exists, this revelation should clarify it. All the money from the hijacked plane was turned over spontaneously to Ernesto Juarez so that the Revolution might triumph in South America. I assume that the defense has proof? Of course, Mr. Prosecutor. A $2 million transfer from anonymous account UBS Zurich 9461 to equally anonymous account 26578 ZK. What if they escaped? What are you saying? They escape, you're safe. You haven't given in to pressure. The protesters will stop... protesting. And you are no longer embarrassed. An escape! That sounds good, but... someone will have to be declared responsible! Of course, I'll assume full responsibility. The accused will rise. Everybody stay calm! This is about those three clowns dressed in red! Let's go, baby-doll! This is an escape, and we want no trouble. So let's all sing "The Marseillaise." All together! One, two, three! Sing, sing! Sing out! Louder! Aldo, the government's with us. Slow down. Leaving Paris always means trouble! But this time, they've been very fair! Fixed us up with an escape. We have to go to Africa, we promised. Where's that damn plane! Where the hell is it? I've got it! I know where it is. It's behind us. We have to go back. It's behind a hill back there. Hang on! I'll make a U-turn! I've already told you this is a phony escape! Take your time! You'll kill us. I'm telling you, nobody is following us! Slow down, we've got time. There! Unbelievable! Stop. - Stop! - We can make it! - I said stop. - They can't catch me! Stop! We'll have to explain. You missed a stop sign. - Did you see a stop sign? - Where was it? Where? - 150 yards back. - There's no stop sign. There's no stop sign. - Officer... - Tell him! This car isn't ours, it's a government car. The plane over there is a government plane! The plane is taking us to Africa. We're not wanted here, so we have to go. Jacques, you try! Well, it's an African problem. Above all, it's an African problem. Because your bosses made a deal with us. They said, "We'll arrange for it." They arranged it. "But you'll go to Africa!" You are blocking us... and they just unblocked us! You're making a big mistake. They asked us to go to Africa. You heard him. They just unblocked us! You can't block us when they unblocked us! He can't explain it. He's a cyclical neuropath. I'll have to explain it to you. Silence! This neuropath did plenty for you! One at a time. One at a time? We're all together. It's a question of Africa! Gentlemen, please, one at a time. Your establishment is uncoordinated! You block us when they unblocked us! Makes no sense. Your job is to unblock so things flow. Over that hill. Fast! Not so fast, take the road! - Faster! - Not so fast. - Not so fast! - Not so fast. - The road's faster! - Watch out! Stop pushing! Well, let go! He's holding me. Let go! He had me by the tie. That moron! Come out of there! A driving neuropath! - Where is he? - We never should've left Paris! Let me tell you. We're going to have a talk, a nice little talk! - You neuropath! - Imbecile! What's wrong? There's the plane! Here's the spectacular climax of the recent trial in Paris that has attracted so much attention. The Minister of Justice has resigned. This news seems directly related to another item reaching our desk. Arriving in Africa without hindrance, the five fugitives who were on trial have been welcomed like true heroes. Let's admit that men capable of donating $2 million to the cause of a Revolution do not grow on trees, even in Africa! Citizens! Comrades! Brothers! Hi, everyone! Ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for granting us political asylum! I want to tell you one thing. I, the cyclical neuropath, the head of Occidental Paranoia, say that power is at the end of a gun! We wanted to be free and we are free! Better a good master than a bad servant! The shortest road from barbarism to decadence runs through civilization! Comrades! Politics is nothing but show business! We have declared in high places that all free men should have neither work, nor family, nor country! We are paper tigers but we are live tigers! And we are against self-management in whorehouses! I'm selling a 1971 Mercedes convertible, a one-owner car with 4,000 miles on it! Long live Mao! Long live Mao, who never stole a Ferrari and never ran over anybody! And long live Free Switzerland! The present government is hanging by a thread. Strikes, unemployment... socialist ideas... everything's rotten. Honey, shall we have coffee here or in the living room? In the living-room. I'll finish my business first. The President is a puppet. If you wish, we'll overthrow him and take power. - Us? - Is power really profitable? Very profitable! But if power is very profitable, General, why not take it yourself? What, a military putsch? No, very unpopular. But with five idols like you... General, when it comes to politics, we know approximately nothing. Don't oversimplify, we do have a certain grounding. You are Marxists? Marx taught us, primarily, the notion of capital. Excuse me, General, I have one question. Once in power, what do we do? Make money. Lots of money. - We'd have to live here? - At first. So, General, when do we take power? Monday won't be possible. The army is on a mission. Tuesday, the Pope is arriving on an official visit. Wednesday! Does that suit you? After arriving in the East African Republic this morning, the Pope was kidnapped. Later on, the kidnappers called, demanding as ransom one franc from all the Catholics in the world. Yes, one franc to free the Pope. That seems surprising, but the telex was reviewed before reaching our desk. It seems authentic since the Vatican has confirmed it. Further confirmation is expected from Africa. Astonishment persists, since security measures were taken. How could the Pope disappear, be kidnapped between the airport and his residence? It's hard to understand. Furthermore, one franc per Catholic makes a large sum. Alms for gangsters! Those are all the details we have. Other reports should be coming in soon. Please, stay tuned! We'll interrupt our programs to report the news. The Pope caper? We cleared about... I mean net... $ 12 million, and no taxes. None! The Pope is marvelous! Everyone knows that, but not to that point. It sells very well, very well. So many people love him. The Pope was just fine. Just fine! Yes, I'm very happy about the Pope. That's adventure. SHORT-TERM PROJECTS ABDUCTIONS OF... The End
