(MAHTOB LAUGHING) (MOODY LAUGHING) BETTY: Mom, you be careful, all right? GRANDMA: All right. I do think this is longer than it used to be. (CHUCKLING) Oh, what a lovely day. Dad is looking so well. Well, he is, isn't he? Yeah. He always was a fighter. I know. Look at Mahtob. She's such a daddy's girl. Well, so were you. Moody! Mahtob! Dad! BETTY: Come on! Fresh homemade lemonade! Come on! Come on, everybody! MAHTOB: Mom, Daddy's teaching me how to fish, again! (BETTY LAUGHING) Dear, can I see today's catch? Oh, one of these days, O ye of little faith. Wait and see. Are you having a good time? Yeah. Here you go. Dad, you want lemonade? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Ah! Sour? A little. Not enough sugar? No. I never can get that right. Hey, there you are. Hey, Mahtob. Honey. Mahtob. What vitamins do we get from lemons? Mahtob, what vitamins do we get from lemons? Vitamin C. Right. And what vitamins do we get from, uh, bananas? Vitamin C, vitamin B, and fiber. Right! Right! Wonderful. GRANDMA: None of my kids were as smart as this little cutie. That's great. Thanks, Mom. And what are you going to be when you grow up? A nurse. Well, you can be a doctor as well, you know? A doctor and a nurse. I wanna know how you expect to teach Mahtob to fish. You've never caught a fish in your life. Honey, it's the best way. This way I'm totally unprejudiced, either way. He bought all this fishing equipment. And a book on how to fish. He's had her out there every day for a month. Nothing. MOODY: Yeah, well, if it's a choice between your lemonade and my fishing, I know where I stand. MAHTOB: I want to sit on Daddy's lap. Well, it's my turn. You always sit on Daddy's lap. Don't fight over me, girls. I think you should find another available lap. (PHONE RINGING) (CHATTERING) And, uh, then we have... Thank you. A 30-year-old woman with a class 3 pap smear for a TAH. So, I think, yeah, so I think... DOCTOR 1: The thing about the Iranians is that they prayed themselves right back into the stone age. What I can't understand is why anybody would come to the States to study medicine? They can get a degree in Iran in, what, two weeks? Seven days. Yeah. I understand the Ayatollah's got some great ideas about medicine. Soldier gets wounded in the field, just let him die. He's gonna go to paradise anyway, right? Certainly. DOCTOR 2: Did you see that newspaper over there? Hmm, the Iranian funny page? DOCTOR 2: How can he read that thing, man? Jesus Christ, it's not even written in words. It looks like one of my prescriptions. I've read that prescription. I wouldn't mind going to Iran. (OPERA PLAYING ON STEREO) (VOLUME INCREASING) Oh, no, no, no. Don't turn it off. It's okay. Honey, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm fine. What's wrong? Have you talked to the family? Is everything all right? Oh, everybody's fine. They're fine. Oh, by the way, uh, Mammal phoned. He and Nasserine have had a baby boy. That's great. A couple of the doctors were making cracks at the hospital again. Who were they? What does it matter? It matters, Moody. It matters. We moved here to get away from all of that. God, it's just so awful. Oh, honey, forget it. Honey, forget it. There are dumb people everywhere. Forget it, honey. "And the genie roared with laughter. (MIMICKING LAUGHTER) "'O thou poor thief of 1,000 alleyways, "'do you think you can marry the sultan's daughter "'when all the princes in Persia are seeking her hand?' "'You foolish slave,' replied Aladdin, boldly. "'Have you forgotten the jewels in the cave? "'You have the wits of a donkey. "'I should put you back into the dirty, old lamp where you belong.'" Is there really Aladdin's cave? I'm sure there must be. Could we find it? (LAUGHS) Well, I'm not sure if I know where it is, but... You know, I was born in Persia. Well, they call it Iran now. If I took you there, maybe we could look for it together, couldn't we? You know, Iran's got caves and mountains and deserts, just like in the story. And mosques. They're so beautiful, they're like jewels. You know, when the sun shines on them, they dazzle your eyes. Would you like to see those? Okay, where were we? Daddy? Uh-huh? Do I hate Americans? What do you mean? Of course not. Lucille says I hate Americans because you're from Iran. Sweetheart, Lucille doesn't really know what she's talking about, so we shouldn't pay too much attention to her. I've lived in America for 20 years. I'm as American as apple pie, and so are you. Give me a kiss. Mmm, big hugs. Mmm, big hugs. (SPEAKING FARSI) (MOODY CONTINUES SPEAKING FARSI) Oh, that was Ameh Bozorg. (SCOFFS) It's always the same. She cries and cries on the phone. "You're like a son to me. "When your mother died, I was the one that raised you. "Now I'm sick, I'm dying, you're a doctor. "You're not here to look after me." Is she sick? No, no. She's not sick. She's 58. She feels old, but she's not sick. It's the same old guilt trip. Oh, honey, come on. She's your sister. She misses you. You have to phone her more often. Phoning's no good. She wants to see me. And now that Mammal and Nasserine have had their baby, everybody's there for the celebration except me. It's been 10 years. I haven't seen my family for 10 years. Mammal and Reza have been here. Why doesn't she just get on a plane and come over here for a visit? She wouldn't do that. She's hardly been out of Teheran. She wants to see me over there. They want to see us. They've never met you or Mahtob. She keeps asking why can't we go over for a vacation. You'll just have to explain it to them. Explain what? We can't go to Iran. Why not? I'm not about to take Mahtob to Iran. It's much too violent. We're not gonna go sightseeing to the Persian Gulf or anything crazy. We're gonna spend two weeks on vacation with my family. Moody, there's too much going on over there. Look, your family is welcome here anytime. You know that. Well, if you feel that strongly about it, maybe you should just go there yourself. No, I don't mean that, either. None of us should go. It's just not safe. MAHTOB: Mommy! Look. I'm coming! You're getting it all out of proportion. Look, I haven't seen any of them for 10 years. MAHTOB: Mommy! Honey, I know how you feel. All right, I'm coming! No, it's okay. Go ahead. Honey, I want to go more than anything. I miss them so much. You're always talking about how important family is. All I want to do is go for two weeks with you and Mahtob and visit my family. Moody, it scares me. What scares you, honey? Look at me. Do you honestly think for one moment that I would take you and Mahtob anywhere that I thought would be dangerous? I love you both more than anything in the whole world. Listen, Mahtob's got her vacation. She starts a new school. It's a good time. I swear to you on the sacred Koran, you won't be in any danger, that we'll be back after two weeks, and that I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize yours or Mahtob's safety. Come on, honey. It's not such a big deal. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (ALL YELLING) (ALL YELLING) Look at what they're doing. (SPEAKING FARSI) (EXCLAIMING) (EXCLAIMING) Hello, Betty. Hello. Nasserine, it's so good to see you. (LAUGHING) Fereshte, Zoreh, this is Mahtob. Betty! Betty! It's Ameh Bozorg! Sweetheart, that's Daddy's sister. For you and Mahtob. Oh, my goodness! Look! Mahtob! Mahtob! Moonlight. You are moonlight. I know. Mahtob means moonlight. Mahtob, Mahtob. Betty? Hello. I am so happy. Now you can be with us. Oh, yes, I'm so glad. It's only for two weeks, but I'm very pleased. I remember your house in America very well. Mammal, so good to see you. At last, finally you are here, Betty. Yes, I'm so glad we could come for a visit. Congratulations on the baby. Thank you. (LAUGHING) What? No, nothing. She say Mahtob look like almost exact to Moody and to Ameh Bozorg. (ALL CHATTERING) MOODY: Some reception, huh? BETTY: Oh, my gosh. It's amazing. Do you know all these people? All of them. (LAUGHING) Oh, boy. This is all my family. Obviously, they really missed you. The car's just over here. (SPEAKING FARSI) Go ahead, unwrap it. It's a gift. Oh! (SPEAKING FARSI) Thank you. Isn't that nice? Oh! Thank you. Thank you. (SPEAKING FARSI) Go on. Put it on. Put it on. Now? Yeah, well, it's a... They've gone to a lot of trouble. It would make her very happy. All right. You know, it's pretty good quality. Okay. Go ahead. Get in the car, okay? (MUSIC BLARING) God. It all looks so different. I thought you said foreign women don't have to wear Islamic dress. Yeah. I know. I made a mistake. It's all changed. Anyway, it's only when you leave the house or when you go outside. You saw the women at the airport. I didn't recognize half my family. They were all covered. Last time I was here, only half of them wore chador. It's all new. What would happen if I didn't wear this? (SPEAKING FARSI) (BOTH SPEAKING FARSI) She says you'd get arrested. (ALL ULULATING) (SPEAKING FARSI) I have to go to the bathroom. Just wait. We're almost there. (ALL CHATTERING) Hi. (GOAT BLEATING) No, no! They're hurting him, Mommy! They're hurting him! Mommy, they're hurting him, Mommy, they're hurting him. It's their way of saying welcome. It's a great honor. They give the meat to the poor. Honey, honey, we have to step over it. It's a custom. It's expected. Just hang on to me. (PEOPLE CHATTERING IN FARSI) (ALL CHATTERING) (PEOPLE CHANTING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (CHANTING) It's the Friday prayer. From the Teheran University. (ALL CHANTING) (SPEAKING FARSI) Prayers. Mmm. (PRAYING) (MAN CHANTING OVER SPEAKERS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SPEAKING FARSI) Honey, don't forget, we got to get some things for your mom and dad. Okay. So hot. Thank you. Now let me do you. Okay? (SPEAKING FARSI) All right? (TIRES SCREECHING) (SPEAKING FARSI) MOODY: Fix your scarf! Fix your hair! Cover your hair! (ALL SHOUTING) (ALL SHOUTING) (SPEAKING FARSI) Honey, I'm sorry. They didn't know you were a foreigner. If they'd had known, they wouldn't have been so harsh. A little bit of hair fell out. I know. I know. Honey, you gotta be careful. They're very strict about the dress code here. (SPEAKS FARSI) You must to cover all. You must not to be careless. Every single hair that is not covered is like a dagger that you aim at the heart of our martyrs. Come on. Just give it time, sweetheart. It's okay. (ALL CHATTERING) Look at these hands. (ALL CHATTERING IN FARSI) (ALL SHUSHING) (WHISPERING) Mom. Shh. (SPEAKING FARSI) Guess that means we can eat. (ALL CHATTERING) Come on. Sit up straight. Is it because I didn't wear a chador? Honey, you misinterpreted. She wasn't looking at you. Honey, you didn't see. She looked at me. It was the same feeling today when the police stopped me. There was such dislike. It just seems so primitive sometimes. Yeah, well, all religious beliefs seem primitive when they're not your own. But to cover them up and hide them away. Are they so afraid of women's sexuality or what? No, no. That's not the reason. Iranian women like to wear the chador. It's a mark of respect. You know, when the Shah tried to ban them, they had demonstrations in the streets. Most women wanted to bring it back. I'm sorry. I know it's a different culture. I guess I just don't understand it. Why is Mammal angry at you, and the others? They seem to be going at you all the time. Yeah, well... You know, my family, they're very religious. They're not sophisticated. They're basically country people. It's all changed so much. It's all back to the Koran. It's been that way since the revolution. You know, when they moved into this house, they got rid of all the furniture. All of it. Now they see me, and I seem so Americanized. And you have an American wife. Yeah. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was come here and insult them in any way. I know, I know. (BOTH SIGHING) Honey, it's going to seem strange for a while, but believe me, they want to love you. They will. I promise. Okay. (LAUGHING) What? Nothing. No, no, nothing. What's so funny? You know they think we make love all the time. Who? The family. Why? Well. Well, because here, you know, after they make love, they have to take a shower because, you know, they can't pray unless they do. You know, it's considered unclean. You know, we're taking two, three showers a day. (LAUGHING) Oh, God, what, they think we're two rabbits or something? (BOTH LAUGHING) I'm not taking another shower the whole time we're here. You knew that the whole time. They didn't know you were such a swinger. You know what I mean? Yeah, but you knew that all along. You were out in the hall giggling. Every time I took a shower. (BOTH LAUGHING) (MAN CHANTING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (BABA HAJJI SPEAKING FARSI) Don't go. I have to. Oh, Moody, please stay. I can't. Honey, you've been getting up early every morning for a week and a half. Don't go. What's the matter with you? I'm with my family. They're Sayyids. You know what that means? They're direct descendants of Mohammed. They deserve a little respect. MOODY: Oh, of course, to the sophisticated American, that must all seem so incredibly primitive. (DOOR CLOSING) (SHOUTING IN FARSI) (KIDS CHATTERING) MOODY: Betty. Oh, God, you scared me. I wondered where you were. I think I got the most beautiful picture if I had this thing set right. The lights have gone. Are you coming in? Yeah. Betty. What? Something happened before we came out here. What? Well, you know, I didn't want to tell you about it. We were coming out here, so... What, Moody, what happened? I got fired from the hospital. You got fired? It happened just before we left. Literally, two days. I can't believe it. They can't do that. Yes, they can. If they can find someone who'll do the job for less money. Oh, no. And who isn't an Iranian. Oh. Moody, I can't believe that. Your work was going so well. Oh, you think they like Iranians in Michigan? It's always there, you know just under the surface. You know, not one of my colleagues has ever stood up for me whenever there was any trouble. Honey, that's not true. Yeah. We're talking about the medical profession. It's supposed to be an educated group of people. What are we going to do? Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're going to go home tomorrow and we're gonna find out how this happened. We'll appeal. It's America. We've got laws. We've got friends. You've got lots of friends. And this just can't happen. (LAUGHING) BETTY: Hey! Hey, will you stop that? Look at you messing everything up. Now, get your own stuff together, please. I don't think they're gonna let this through. Maybe Mammal can ship it. Sweetheart, listen to me. Do you want to pack Toby Bunny or do you want to carry him? It's gonna be awfully hot. Pack him. Okay, pack him. Sit down here right now and fold up all those clothes you messed up. Can I put him in the suitcase? Yes, you may. Sweetheart, you haven't packed anything. You want me to do it for you? No. (SPEAKING FARSI) You must take passport to the airport three days before to get approval. You have not done this. Approval? What approval? It is no time. You must to get stamp. You cannot leave today. Well, when can we leave? When's the next flight? I don't know. Moody, what is this? I don't know. We'll have to wait for the next available flight, I guess. How could you not take care of the passports? Didn't somebody tell you about this, Moody? How could you let this happen? It's a mistake. Nobody thought about it. Well, then, we'll go to the airport, and we'll tell them we didn't know about the three-day requirement. Maybe they'll just let us through. And if not, we'll just sit there and we'll wait for the next flight. I don't know how to say this to you. We're not going back. We're staying here. What do you mean? How long? I want to get a job here, in a hospital. What? I want us to live in Iran. No. No. There's nothing for me in America. No. No. What... What, are you crazy? We're Americans. Your daughter's an American. Moody, honey, you're upset about your job and everything, I understand that. We're gonna go back today and we're gonna fix it. I want Mahtob to grow up here. No! I think she should become a Muslim. No! No! You lied to me. You lied to me. You held the Koran and swore to me that nothing was gonna happen. Mommy. You were planning this all the time. You lied to me. Mommy, aren't we going home today? Yes, we are, honey. I want you to go downstairs and I want you to say goodbye to everybody. All right. (DOOR CLOSING) BETTY: Moody, I know what's been going on. They've got no right. You've got to resist it. Moody, I know how much you miss your family, how guilty they make you feel. I know the kind of pressure they're putting on you. I know you want to spend some time here. I promise you we'll come back, we'll spend time here. But we can't stay here. This is a backward, primitive country. I won't live here. I won't bring up my daughter here. How can you even consider raising Mahtob here? Don't you see how they treat women? I know it's the right decision if you just give it a chance. No. For all of us. For you and for Mahtob. No, Moody, you can't mean this. I'm a highly qualified doctor. They're desperate for doctors in Iran. I could do a lot of good here. Please. Besides, I'm a Muslim. Please. This is where I should be. This is where my family should be. Please, please don't do this. Look, I know it seems harsh, but it's best thing for all of us. Mahtob could learn real values here! No! I won't stay here! You can't keep me... Now, you listen to me. You're in my country now. You're my wife. You do as I say. You understand me? We're staying here. (DOOR SLAMMING) Mammal, would you translate for me? Please excuse me if I don't get my words straight. I'm a bit shaken up. I wanted to come down here and talk to you to see if you could understand my feelings. (SPEAKING FARSI) Moody and I have been married for seven years. We've loved each other very much. And we have trusted each other. Trust was always very important. (MAMMAL SPEAKING FARSI) I didn't want to come here. Moody knew that. I made it very clear to him. The only reason I came was to visit with all of you and so that you could meet our daughter. (SPEAKING FARSI) But I was frightened. And so Moody swore to me on the holy Koran that nothing would happen. That nothing like this could happen. (SPEAKING FARSI) He held the Koran, and he swore to me. Isn't that true, Moody? Isn't that true? I had to. You wouldn't have come with me if I hadn't. Baba Hajji, you're a religious man. How can Moody swear on the Koran and then do this to me? (SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) (ALL YELLING IN FARSI) Allah will forgive him. (YELLING IN FARSI) No, no! Ameh Bozorg, Ameh Bozorg, please help me, please! (ALL SHOUTING IN FARSI) No! You can't do this! God damn you! God damn you! You can't keep me here! You had this planned all along! Damn you! I'll be with you. I'll help you. Will you try to go to sleep? (DOOR OPENING) Where are the checkbooks and credit cards? And I'll need the house keys and the keys to the car. They're in the small bag, I think. BETTY: Moody, talk to me, please. There's nothing more to say. Oh, Moody, please! (DOOR SHUTS) Please talk to me! (BETTY SOBBING) BETTY: Moody! Moody, please! (SPEAKING FARSI) (THUNDER RUMBLING) MOODY: I told you to stop calling here. No, she's not available. Yeah, well, she's also my wife, which means she wants to do what I want. Look, you're not helping him by doing this. Yes. I know that very well, and I'm very sorry, but this isn't going to help his illness go away. So please leave us alone. No, I will not discuss... Look, I really don't care about that. The State Department can do what the hell it likes! Betty, you've got to eat. You can't keep this up. You're going to make yourself very sick. You know, if I thought you really wanted to stay here, we could have such a great life. You know, when I first heard the Shah was leaving Iran, just after Mahtob was born, I couldn't believe it. It was just amazing. They had everyone on the streets, millions of people. I should have been here. For the first time, we could say to everyone, "This is our faith. "This is our way of life. This is who we are. "And nothing can stop us." You can't imagine what that was like. I know things have been hard for you. They'll get better. I promise you. Dear Lord, hear our prayer. Dear Lord, hear our prayer. Please help us leave Iran and get back to America. Please help us leave Iran and get back to America. Please let nothing separate us. Please let nothing separate us. And keep us always safe in your care. And keep us always safe in your care. Amen. Amen. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. GRANDMA: Hello, Betty. Mom! Don't talk. Just listen. Mom. Oh, God! You are to go to the American Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy. There is no US Embassy in Iran anymore. Okay. It's on Kiribah Fereshteh Street. Kiribah. Their number is 625475. 625475. What are you doing? I knew from the beginning... It was ringing. I answered it. ...something dangerous... Why do you want to humiliate me in front of my family? I've told you before, you don't touch the phone! And you don't leave the house! Now do you understand me? Yes! (PHONE RINGING) MAN: Swiss Embassy. (WHISPERING) American Interests Section. I can't hear you calling. You'll have to talk louder. I can't talk louder. I can't hear you, caller. Are you there, caller? Are you there, caller? Please, help me. I'm being held hostage. You'll have to talk louder, caller, you're very faint. I can't. I'm being held hostage. Please help me. I'm sorry I can't hear you, caller. (PHONE CLICKS) Who were you talking to? When? Before, on the phone. No one. It was nothing. Now don't lie to me. I know you're lying to me. Stop it, Daddy! Stop it! It's okay, honey. It's between Mommy and me. It was nothing, really. I tried to call Nasserine, I got the wrong number. (CHUCKLES) What do you think, huh? You think you can lie to me? You think you can do anything in this house without me knowing about it? My family tell me everything. They're watching you all the time. So, please, don't be stupid. Mommy isn't stupid. By the way, she's gonna have to start school pretty soon. We'll have to get her the right clothes. I don't want to go to school. (DOOR SLAMMING) Moody, what school? When? (CAR HONKING) American Interests... Uh, the Swiss Embassy. Swiss Embassy. Kiribah Fereshteh is the name of the street. Kiribah Fereshteh. (MAN ON INTERCOM SPEAKING FARSI) Swiss Embassy. My name is Betty Mahmoody. I'm an American citizen. Show your passport inside. (GATE BUZZER RINGING) (SPEAKING FARSI) Thank you. Passport. We don't have our passports. My husband has them. We're American citizens. (SPEAKING FARSI) You can go. We can go. Mommy, we can go home! My name is Nicole Ajamian. Betty Mahmoody. This is my daughter Mahtob. Please, do sit. Thank you. We're so glad to see you. Um... I spoke with my mother in the United States. And I know that the State Department is into this. We're just very happy to be here. We'll sleep anywhere for as long as it takes until you can get us out. What are you talking about? You cannot stay here. I can't go back to my husband. I want to go home to the United States. That may be, but you are in Iran. You are married to an Iranian? Yes. Then you are an Iranian citizen. No, no, I'm not. I'm an American citizen, and my daughter is an American citizen. We were born in the United States. We have American passports. I mean, we don't... We don't have them with us. My husband has them. We've never changed our citizenship. If you marry an Iranian man, you automatically become an Iranian citizen. The laws regarding women are very strict. You cannot travel anywhere without written permission. You have no rights to the children. They go to the man in a divorce. I'm sorry, but you will have to go back to your husband. But we'll never get out of Iran. We're being held hostage. It was almost impossible to come here. Mrs. Mahmoody, there are many American women here in similar circumstances. May I ask you why you came to Iran? I don't know. I don't know. I was afraid to come. I wanted to please him. I trusted him. I was frightened to come, but I never thought this would happen. I thought of him as an American. He's changed. Oh, God, he's changed. Look, Mrs. Mahmoody, many came back after the revolution feeling guilty about being away, about turning their backs on Iran and on Islam. Now Iran is an Islamic state, and that's a wonderful thing for many Iranians. Well, if there is anything I can do, maybe if you need to organize telephone calls to the US, or you want to write letters home... (BLEATING) (MAN CALLING SHEEP) So, if Daddy asks, we went for a walk and got lost, okay? (YELLING IN FARSI) Mommy! Mommy! Where were you, huh? I went for a walk! I went... I went out for a walk, and I got lost! Where were you? We went for a walk... Shut up! You try anything like this again, I'll kill you! (SOBBING) Oh, my God.

Hi. Nasserine said you wanted to see me. I can't believe she's five, can you? No. Thank you for today, the doll and everything. I miss her. It seems I haven't spent much time with her lately. Moody, I want to make it work. You were such a wonderful father today. It brought it all back. Honey, I want you to be happy. I want to make you happy. I need you to help me. Oh, Betty. I didn't want it to be like this. I love you. I never want to hurt you. Oh, Moody. Moody, I need you... I need you to help me. We can't stay in this house. It's my sister's house. She'd be insulted if we went away. No, no, she doesn't really want us here. She doesn't like me. We've got nowhere else to go. Yes, we do. We could stay with Mammal and Nasserine. We helped them when they were in the States. Nasserine goes to classes. I could baby-sit. I could help. Please. Oh, Betty... I don't want to lose you. BETTY: I want you to tell me anything I can ever do. (SPEAKING FARSI) The kitchen. Kitchen. Kitchen. (BOTH SPEAKING FARSI) You teach me. I'll cook for you. I'm so grateful, Nasserine. (SPEAKING FARSI) Thank you so much. (SPEAKING FARSI) I was just telling him that, uh, the same rules apply as before. MOODY: Mammal. (DOOR SHUTS) MOODY: You have to wear chador tonight. Oh? My uncle's a Mullah. He's highly respected. He's a very influential man. He's written books on Islam. Maybe he's gonna help me get a job. (EXCLAIMS) Betty, you are a very good Iranian cook. Thank you. You are lucky people. Why you wear chador? I thought I had to. But why? Chador is Persian tradition. It's not necessary to wear it inside. It is exaggerated with some people now. Mahmood told me you read Koran. Yes. I try. I like to. Very good. You go to Koran class? No. Mahmood must send you there. They are in English language. Would you like? Yes, very much. The Hadith, or reports, of the collected sayings of the Prophet with additional commentaries by devout and learned men. In our readings from the Koran, we'll pause to consider the Hadith when appropriate. What page are we on? I don't know. She just... You're American. Yeah. ...since the death of Adam without there being on it an imam guiding the people to God. (WOMEN LAUGHING) BETTY: You're kidding? I'm from Chicago but I lived in Michigan. Where in Michigan? Near Lansing. Where near Lansing? Oh, it's a little place. You wouldn't know it. Owosso. Are you... I lived there for five years. I went to grammar school there. I lived on the corner of Linden and Noleen. ELLEN: My husband's a doctor. He had his own practice there. BETTY: My husband's a doctor, too. I can't believe this! (BOTH LAUGHING) And now I work for an English language magazine for Islamic women. Have you become Muslim? Mmm-hmm. Did you convert? Well, I wanted to, I guess. My husband was happy I did. (LAUGHS) It made things a lot better. Uh, I'll... I got to go. Ellen, it's been so... No, really. BETTY: Moody. You'll never guess. I just met an American woman in class. She's from Owasso. Her husband's a doctor. Are they here? No, they just left. She's invited us over. Is that all right? Yeah, that's fine. I want you to ask questions when you're out with your daddy. Uh-huh. I want you to ask him questions about taxis and buses. And how much things cost. Okay. All right? Ask him questions about the signs. What the signs mean, what they say. All right. And then you'll be able to teach me. Why do you want to learn all that? I'm gonna have to if we're gonna get out of here. MOODY: It's got lentils and beans. And what's that? That's his name on the sign. What's he selling? That's sabzi. See, it's all kinds of things that they sell here. These are pictures of all the people that died in the war. They put the pictures up so everybody remembers them. (SPEAKING FARSI) (REPEATING) (NASSERINE LAUGHING) Yeah, that's one, too. Why all these questions, honey? What's that? Well, that's the rest of the market. And look, here's some fruit here. MAHTOB: What do they do? They sprinkle sugar on the beets, and it's almost like a candy. (SPEAKING FARSI) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) The moment the Shah left, I wanted to go back to Iran, but Ellen didn't want to. So I said, uh, "Fine. "I'll go without you." (CHUCKLING) So, uh, she came. The first year in Iran, things were very bad between us. She couldn't adjust. Could you, Ellen? I took quite a time before she understood how to be a good wife. Ooh. (ELLEN EXCLAIMING) Warm, isn't it? Yes. Why did you come back? I mean, my God! He let you go home to the States, and you came back. Maybe, at the beginning if... Of course there was the custody problem with the kids, so... It was tough for me. You know, I had no experience. Small American town. Was he violent? Not in the States, never. You're not supposed to, you know. It's not Islamic. Marriages do work out here. They can be good. It's been hard for me at times, but you've got to give it time, Betty. Islam has such beauty in it. I mean, I'm glad my kids are growing up as Muslims. Ellen, I'm so happy we've become friends. I mean, you told me you were from home. I was so thrilled! It's like a miracle. Ellen. I have something I want to tell you. If I do, can you keep it a secret? Not tell your husband? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ellen, I'm sorry. Please, please forget I spoke. No, it's okay. Go ahead. I won't tell him. That's a promise. Would you take this letter for me? I'm trying to get back home to America with my daughter. My family is working on it, but there's nothing I can do. Moody knows where I am every single minute. (DOOR OPENING) (MEN LAUGHING) Are you crazy? Don't you realize what can happen? Terrible things. You just can't, Betty. You know, if you were caught, they could execute you. (WHISPERING) It's for the Embassy. (BOTH SPEAKING IN FARSI) (MOODY CHUCKLING) Can you believe that? They're desperate for doctors in Iran. They got thousands of casualties from the war. But because I trained in America, no one will give me a job. That is not the reason. (BOTH SPEAKING FARSI) I'm telling you, hard to believe that this country was getting quite sophisticated before the revolution. I mean, we were building chemical plants, oil refineries. Multi-million dollar installations. And what's happened? They're all rotting in the desert because nobody knows how to operate them. It's all so primitive! (SPEAKING FARSI) Honey, somebody needs to go to the market. We're out of meat and things. Yeah, I can't go. But it's for tonight's dinner. Well, I can't go. It'll have to wait till Nasserine gets back. But she's home so late, what'll we do tonight? I don't know. Can't you go by yourself for a change? Yeah, I can, really. I know the way, it's not far. I'll take the children. (BABY COUGHING) You give me a list of everything you need, and I'll tell you exactly how long it'll take and what time for you to be back here. Take the baby with you. Mahtob can stay here with me. (ALL SHOUTING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) You are American? Yes. I need dosari for the telephone. I was in America many times. Uh, New York, uh, Amarillo, Texas. You want to telephone? Please, come, please. Thank you. BETTY: American Interests Section. Nicole Ajamian. Nicole, it's Betty. Have you heard anything from the State Department yet? No! I can't. I can't... Because he watches me all the time, or he has somebody watch me. I didn't know that. Will they let us go if I get a divorce? What? I can't do that. I can't do that. I won't leave her. Nicole, Nicole, I won't leave her. All right. I will get to the Embassy if I can. Thank you. You're very kind. You can use the telephone when you want. No problem. Thank you. I like America very much. My son was, uh, with University of Texas. That is my son. He's a martyr for the war. My name is Hamid. Anytime for telephone, you come here. I'm Betty. MAHTOB: Who's gonna take me to school tomorrow? I don't know, honey. It'll either be me, or it'll be Daddy. But I want you to. I don't know if I can, Mahtob. Why can't you? Honey, I promise you I'll be there, and everything will be all right. Okay? Come on. Dear Lord. Dear Lord. Hear our prayer. Hear our prayer. We beg you to help us leave Iran. We beg you to help us leave Iran. And get back to America. And get back to America. Please let nothing separate us. (MAHTOB CRYING) BETTY: I know, honey. I know. I'll be back this afternoon, sweetheart, I'll be back. I'll be back, sweetheart. Sweetheart, I'll be back, I'll be here, sweetheart. (CRYING) Don't worry, baby. Mommy, please! (MUTTERS) (MAHTOB CRYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Take the baby. I'll get the rice. (SPEAKING FARSI) Hamid, I can't stay. You must to come inside. There is someone here. Miss Nassimi. She came to help you. Hamid told me you wish to leave Iran. You know it is extremely dangerous. I have to get back to the United States. Why don't you try to get a divorce? No! No, if I get a divorce, then my husband will get custody of my daughter. I can't do that. If they catch you trying to escape with your daughter, they could execute you. I can't leave her here. Look, I have... Please. Wait. I think we can help you. My brother has helped many people here. I will be here Wednesday and Thursday at this time if you can come. Here is my telephone number. Memorize it. Please, don't keep it. Thank you. (NASSERINE SPEAKING FARSI) (BOTH SPEAKING FARSI) I got the rice. I'm sorry. (NASSERINE CHATTERING IN FARSI) What happened? She was crying all day, and I had to go pick her up. We can't make her do this, Moody. She's frightened. I know. Tomorrow they want you to go to school with her. Okay. They want you to stay with her every day. Of course. Of course, I'll stay with her. They're all devout women there. You'll be watched. Okay. I just want Mahtob to be happy. I want her to have a happy childhood. Don't you want to give her that? Islam's the greatest gift I can give my child. (TEACHER AND STUDENTS CHANTING) (ALL SCREAMING) (BOMB EXPLODING) (ALL SCREAMING) (ALARM BLARING) (ALL SCREAMING) You said there'd be no danger. Do you remember, Moody? Mahtob could have been killed. America's doing this! Who supplying the bombs who supplies the planes? Whose backing Iraq? Don't be so naive, America's responsible for this war! No one else! (POLICE SIREN WAILING) You should not behave this way. I had to tell Hormoz. It is your duty as a wife to tell your husband everything! You cannot have secrets. (SPEAKING FARSI) (WOMEN CHATTERING IN FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) Very nice, very nice. (SPEAKING FARSI) Mahtob. Very nice. Very nice. I am very sorry. It's bad in Iran. Bad for you and your husband. I'm sorry. We help you. We help you, help you. Could I use the telephone? Telephone? (SPEAKING FARSI) (ALL CHATTER) Husband, no telephone. You, inside, you, inside. Right. You come after morning. 11, after morning. I can come late with Mahtob? (SPEAKING FARSI) (WOMEN SPEAKING FARSI) Thank you. HOUSSEIN: There are three principal ways out of Iran. You could go to Baluchistan and then across the mountains into Pakistan. In the southwest to Bandar Abbas, then across the gulf by boat to Oman. This is the most dangerous route. From Teheran across the Zagros mountains through Kurdistan into Turkey. There are checkpoints everywhere, and the border crossing's very heavily armed. Which way do you think is best? The gulf. How much will it cost? When you and your daughter are safely back in America, then if you can, perhaps you will reimburse me. Dollars would be of more help to me than Iranian currency. Keep in touch with my sister. Right. (WOMEN CHATTERING IN FARSI) BETTY: Run, run, run. (SCREAMING) MOODY: Where were you, hmm? MAHTOB: Stop it, Daddy, stop it. Where you been? (BETTY SCREAMING) (GROANING) (BETTY SCREAMING) Mommy! Mommy! Get up! Get up! Get up! (BETTY SCREAMING) (BETTY GRUNTING) I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna cut you up. You're gonna be dead! Get out. MOODY: Betty! Betty! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (COIN CLINKING) (SOBBING) Nicole Ajamian. Nicole Ajamian. (SOBBING) Nicole. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. He said he was gonna kill me. (SPEAKING FARSI) (STUDENTS SPEAKING FARSI) (TEACHER SPEAKING FARSI) (STUDENTS SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) This woman is from the Embassy. I need to take Mahtob. (SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) Impossible. Child goes to father. You don't understand. He's gonna kill me. I have to get my daughter. Madame, you wait. Husband come. I want my baby! Madame, madame. I want my baby. Madame. (ALL CHATTERING) BETTY: I want my baby! (SPEAKING FARSI) Betty, they won't let you take her. The State Department wants you to go to the Iranian Foreign Minister and ask for his help. No! The State Department can't do anything. They can't help me now. Don't you know that? They don't even understand the culture. They'll only make things worse. Madame, you wait for your husband. Tell her I want my baby. I want my baby! (SPEAKING FARSI) I cannot. Please, please, please. (BETTY SOBBING) Please. (BELL RINGING) (SOBBING) Listen, honey. Don't talk right now. Because I have to tell you you can't talk about Hamid or the Embassy. Because if you do, they'll never let us get away. Don't say anything. Do you hear me? Mommy, don't leave me. Don't go away. I promise you. I promise you I won't leave you. Do you hear? I won't leave you. Where are Mammal and Nasserine? You, don't ask questions. Is that enough for you sweetheart? They've moved in with Ameh Bozorg. BETTY: Moody, what're you doing? (SCREAMING) Moody, Moody, please, please. Please don't take her, Moody. Please don't take her. Moody, Moody, Moody, please! (LOCK CLICKING) Moody! Moody! Moody! (SOBBING) Moody, don't take her! Don't take her. (BETTY CRYING) MOODY: Does Mommy ever take you on adventures? Come on. Where does she take you? To Koran class. We saw some camels. Yeah? You go anywhere else? How come you were late for school yesterday? Where were you? We got lost. No, you didn't, Mahtob. I know you didn't! We did, we did! (AMEH BOZORG YELLING) Where the hell were you? (SPEAKING FARSI) Where were you? MAHTOB: We got lost! Stop you lying to me. Where were you? We got lost! (SPEAKING FARSI) (MOODY SPEAKING FARSI) (MUMBLING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (AMEH BOZORG CHATTERING) (DOOR CLOSING) Moody. Moody, please don't leave. How is Mahtob? (LOCK CLICKING) Please. Please tell me. (SOBBING) Is she all right? (MEN CHANTING) (SIREN BLARING) (AIRPLANE APPROACHING) (BOMB EXPLODING) (WHISPERS) Mahtob. Mahtob. (SIREN WAILING) (DOOR OPENING) MOODY: Betty? Betty? Mahtob! Mahtob! You brought her back to me. (SOBBING) Thank you. Thank you. (SOBBING) Thank you. Thank you. ALL: * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, dear Mahtob * Happy birthday to you (AMEH BOZORG SPEAKING FARSI) (ALL SINGING) (CHATTERING IN FARSI) (ALL CHATTERING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (WOMEN SINGING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Will you be all right? Yes, but when will you be back? I'll be back as soon as I can. All right. All right. You be brave. I will. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) HOUSSEIN: We will fly you to Bandar Abbas and then take you by speedboat across the gulf. I'll never be able to thank you. Please, Betty, there's really no need. Just make the journey safely. I wish you could have seen this in the summer. All the flowers are gone now. Gardens have always had a special place in Persia throughout our history. In fact, the word "paradise" is a Persian word. It's hard to believe, isn't it, that the idea of paradise will always be intimately connected with Iran? Whenever I think of what's happening to my country, I try to remember its gardens. You must try and phone me, now, whenever you can. By Christmas you'll be home. * Joy to the world * The Lord has come * Let Earth receive her king * Let every heart (SPEAKING FARSI) (AMEH BOZORG EXCLAIMING) Merry Christmas. HOUSSEIN: I'm sorry, Betty, but the gulf got too dangerous. There are warships everywhere, and they're checking all the civilian boats. Zahedan is safer, so I booked a flight for you and Mahtob on Wednesday, 29th January, 10 days from now. Wednesday. Good, Moody's at the hospitals on Wednesdays. On the 29th, I'd like you to take Mahtob to the school bus as usual. We will pick you both up from the bus stop, take you to a safe house until it's time to get you to the airport. (SPEAKING FARSI) BETTY: Was he in pain? Is he now? How much? How long has he known? So he's not responding in any way to the treatment? What is it? (INAUDIBLE) And they all felt that way? What? Mother, would you hold on for a moment? It's my father. He's not doing well. They feel they should operate... Tell her we'll go to America to see him. Tell her you're going. Go on. Tell her you're gonna see him. Tell her now. Mom, Moody says we can come home. I'm sorry about your father. Thank you. Moody, will you be able to come home with us? No, I can't go. I'd lose my job at the hospital. But it's all right for Mahtob to come? No, she can't go either. She's got school. You'll have to go on your own. I can't go without Mahtob. Why not? Of course, you can, you'll see your father. What's the problem? I won't go without her. (SIGHING) Betty. You'll leave as soon as possible. You'll see your father, and then you'll liquidate all our assets in the States. MOODY: It's my money, and I want it! (DOOR SLAMMING) HOUSSEIN: Don't do it, Betty. If you go, you'll never see your daughter again. He won't allow you back into the country. BETTY: My father is dying, I've got to go see him. I don't think he'd want you to, Betty. If he knew that it meant losing your daughter. Why can't I go now, and then come back? Maybe later try to get out. You can't leave Mahtob here. Not with Moody's family. They're from the provinces. They're more fanatical than most. This regime only encourages them. Look, there are some people in this country that consider a girl ready for marriage at nine years of age. Child brides are not unknown. If you want to be free with Mahtob, then you've got to leave on the 29th, as we agreed. But he may send me out before, maybe even tomorrow, I don't know. He hasn't said. (SHOUTING IN FARSI) HOUSSEIN: For the war. They take them younger and younger. Twelve years old, some of them. They give them plastic keys to paradise, made in Taiwan, and tell them that they'll go straight to heaven if they die for their country. They use them sometimes to clear the mine fields. Children run across the field and get blown to pieces. Okay. We've only a week to go. He's got to get your passport validated. He can't do it in the time. Believe me, it's just not possible. He trusts you now. Try and do anything you can to delay him. MOODY: Where were you? Moody, I went to the market. I wanted to buy my father some gifts, but I couldn't find anything I liked. Huh. The one day I come home early. I've let you go. I've given you freedom. Okay, now listen to me. If you don't do exactly as I say, I'm gonna have to lock you up for the rest of your life. And that means you'll never, never see Mahtob again. You understand me? Now, on the 26th, you get on that plane to America. You do exactly as I say. You send everything back here, and then you return. And in the meantime, you do not touch the phone, and you don't step one foot outside this house! Now is that clear? Yes. Moody? You booked for the 26th? What do you mean? Of course, I booked. You got the validation? Remember last time? Zia knows people. It's all been done. (ALL SPEAKING FARSI) I hope your father gets well. I'm sorry I can't see you off tomorrow. (PHONE RINGING) Please come back to us. We love you. Your father will be very happy to see you. (SPEAKING FARSI) There's an emergency. They want me to go back to the hospital. (SPEAKING FARSI) (SPEAKING FARSI) (MOODY SPEAKS FARSI) I've got to go. (SINGING) (AMEH BOZORG CHATTERING) BETTY: I have to go to the market. There's a few things that I need for the khoresht. It'll take me about 20 minutes. Uh, I'll go... Oh, no, no, no. It's all right. I need some fresh air anyway. I'd like to buy some gifts for my father. There's just been no time. (SPEAKING FARSI) Honey, Mahtob. Wanna get your scarf and your jacket? (AMEH BOZORG EXCLAIMS) (SPEAKING FARSI) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (AMEH BOZORG SPEAKING FARSI) (ALL CLAMORING) Houssein. Houssein. Houssein, I have her with me. Houssein, listen to me, this is the last chance I have. We have to leave now. Betty, come. (DOOR SHUTS) NASSIMI: My brother wants you to call your husband and delay him. But first, I must call Houssein and tell him you're safe. I forgot Toby Bunny. What? I forgot Toby Bunny. Honey, honey, do you wanna go home to America? Mahtob, stop crying. Stop crying. (SNIFFING) Listen now, if we go back and get Toby Bunny, we have to stay there with Daddy. Now do you want that? When will I see my daddy again? I don't know. Stop crying now. I love you. I love you. You be my big, brave girl. All right, now. No, Moody. I'm not gonna get on that airplane. MOODY: Why not? What are you trying to do? What are you planning, Betty? Nothing. I'm not planning anything. I'm gonna call the police. Well, then you go ahead and call the police. Because there are a few things I'd like to tell them, too. Like what? Like, I know the clinic isn't legal. You don't have an operating permit. How do you know? I know. I found out. I found out. What, I sit there all day long. You think I wouldn't notice a thing like that? What do you want to do to me? I'm only trying to be good to you. You want to be happy, don't you? Yes. Well, then we don't need the police, do we? I agree. It's not gonna be necessary... That won't be necessary. Now, once we get together, we'll talk about this, Betty, huh? Um... Betty. Well, I'll have to think about it. Yeah, yeah. Well, you better think about it, because I don't believe a word you say anymore. How could you do this? How could you take Mahtob away? You're stealing my child. No, no, no, no. I'm not gonna promise you anything, Betty. You're my wife! Now get your ass back here! (SPEAKING FARSI) Hello, Betty. This is Zia. Zia, I want you to tell Moody that I have a lawyer. Tell Moody I won't meet with him alone. If he wants to talk with me, I'll be there between 11:00 and 12:00 tomorrow morning, and 6:00 and 8:00 tomorrow afternoon. You tell him that. We're ready. We must go now. They'll find you if you stay any longer in Teheran. BETTY: Okay. Okay, let me get my things. HOUSSEIN: We've had no time to organize any paperwork, so you may have some difficulty in Turkey. But at least they won't send you back here. Try to get to the US Embassy when you get to Ankara. We'll drive you to the Zagros mountains. Tribesmen will take you across. They're Kurdish. Most of them are friendly. They know the route and how to avoid all the checkpoints. Now, you must not let anybody know you're American. First you must be very careful of the checkpoint outside Teheran. Betty, very soon, I hope, you will be strolling again in your own garden at home, in America. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (POLICE SIREN BLARING) (SPEAKING FARSI) (POLICE SIREN BLARING) BETTY: Hurry.
