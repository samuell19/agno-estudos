I'm sorry things are a little crazy right now, but... please tell me we're good. For the show, yeah. Beyond that, I don't know. All right, that's a wrap on season ten of "Celebrity Dance Off." Great job, everyone. Let's hear it for my amazing co-host, Joanna. Thank you, everyone. I'll meet you outside in just a minute, Billy. Nice job today, nice job. Hey, great work, everyone. Great work. Bravo. Fantastic show. Now get some rest. All right, Christmas special rehearsal start on Monday. Wayne, my man! Terrific show tonight, huh? Mr. Holiday, what else would we expect from the most talented man in all of television? Not half of television... All of television. That's very nice, Wayne, but you don't have to say stuff like that to me. Actually, I do. It's an executive mandate to suck up. Anyways, um... the network has been talking, and I wanted to give you a little heads up. Oh, yeah, I heard the brass might want to make some changes next season. Love it. Great idea. Keep it fresh. What if we do all live shows? Nothing like that energy. Yeah, well, that's changey but not change. And not exactly what the network has in mind. Billy, can I be honest with you? - I certainly hope so. - Right. Ever since you and Joanna broke up, the two of you aren't working anymore. The audience doesn't like the split, the chemistry isn't there, and look at the ratings. Not as good as when you guys were America's sweethearts. I can never get that whistle into the bomb thing. Anyway, they want you two to get back together. Well, that's not gonna happen. Yeah, that's what I thought you'd say. So what exactly are you trying to say, Wayne? What are they gonna do, fire us? Wait... wait, are they firing us? No, no, no, no. They would never fire Joanna. Just you. What? We can't get rid of Joanna right now! Individually, she's doing great. People love them some J-Gar. And look at her ratings. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. And the social media followings. They're following Billy. They're really following good. So you're just getting rid of me? Totally. But not in a bad way. How not in a bad way? I don't know why I said that. I guess I'm just a people pleaser. You can't do this. This is my show! I created it! I produce it, I host it! I'm on all the friggin' posters. Keep up that fire, Billy. That's gonna serve you well in landing your next gig. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. Fine, fine, fine. I'm just gonna concentrate and pour all my energy into the Christmas special. Ooh... that makes this next part much harder to say. Now what? Are you canceling the Christmas special too? No, we can't do that. Well, then what? Think of it as a re-casting. Hi. I guess you heard. Joanna. Evidently you heard first. Shall we? Billy Holiday. God bless the child that's got his own. Breaking news you will only see here. "Access Hollywood" has confirmed that "Celebrity Dance Off" host and executive producer Billy Holiday is leaving the show after 10 years. Sources reveal that the former dancer will also be replaced on the network's annual Christmas special. In an exclusive statement, the network tells "Access Hollywood," "Billy has left to pursue other exciting opportunities." Hi, mijo, it's mom. Just wanted to call and see if you were doing okay. I know you're not busy, so call me back. Love you. Yes, of course I can hold. - Got more tinsel. - Oh, great. Hey, did you see the news? Billy Holiday got fired. Who? Pheebs, he's the most famous person to come out of Garnet. Mom's best dance student like, ever? He was the host of that "Celebrity Dance Off" show. Oh, right, right, with the dimples, yeah. Yeah. It's a shame. He was always so sweet. You know, Mom said he had that X factor even as a kid. Well, now he's an ex-host. Hi, yes. You will? Oh! Thank you, Mr. Kelsey. Bye-bye. Okay, get this... Until Christmas, Kelsey's Barbershop is going to be giving half price haircuts to every customer that buys a pair of tickets to the dance recital. Same arrangement at Ramos Brothers Garage. Well, for oil changes, not haircuts. Make sense. I was worried. So all the money for the recital is going towards that trip, right? Yeah. I'm gonna take the kids to New York. Broadway, of course. Of course. Where are you with fundraising again? Uh, not exactly where I thought I would be at this point, but there's still two weeks left and people are always more giving at Christmas time, right? Your optimism is definitely from a gene that I didn't get. You know, we can always call Mom and Dad and see if they have any advice... Don't even suggest it. Okay, they've been planning that retirement cruise for years, plus, this is my first year running the studio. I kinda want to prove to myself that I can do it. I'll follow your lead then. Thanks. That bake sale, though. Now that is gonna bring in a lot of dough. Pun intended. How much are you charging for each cookie? Uh, $1. Yeah, that'll do it. Listen, I will donate five Christmas berry pies from the diner for the bake sale. Fine, ten pies. It's almost Christmas. 11? Don't push it. Oh, shoot. I've got Intro to Tap in five minutes. Let's get this tree decorated quickly. You might need a little insurance. Here. Make a wish on the big guy. Need all the help I can get. Okay. Let's do this, Santa. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hey, Dallas. Hello, "Gull-yermo." Its Guillermo... whatever. Only my mom calls me that. Well, good, because I'm feeling very maternal towards you today. I don't want you to wallow in this pig-pen situation, you hear me? Put it in storage. It's not the end of the world. In fact, I just got off the phone with an offer for you to be the grand marshal of the Christmas parade. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. I love the Hollywood Christmas parade. I can totally use that right now. Yeah, it's Pacoima. I'm sorry, did you say Pacoima? Yeah, that's where the parade is. You know, I always thought that there was a Y in Pacoima. How great of a slogan would that be? There's no Y in Pacoima, but there could be a U. Well, I don't care how you spell it, it's not gonna be me. Okay, good. Then we'll put a pin in it. Now what you got popping on your end? You getting any interest? Only from my mom. She wants me to come home for the holidays. You know what, that's a great idea. That is the perfect place to lay low. I didn't see Pacoima as a fit, either. I'm glad we're on the same page. - We are? - Yeah. Look, at the end of the day, we take a break, we let people miss you, and then we circle back. How's that sound? Until then, I want you to keep that chiseled chin up. You hear me, handsome pants? Shakira says hi! There you go, Rae, the first Winter Mint Choco Fantasia drink of the season. Thank you. My favorite. Mmm. Heaven. How come we only make these at Christmas time? Well, because nobody but you likes it. - Miss H. - Hey, Junior. What's up, buddy? I got some news. Uh, uh. Let me guess. You've been practicing that shuffle step combination for the recital, right? Well, there's a shuffle step in it. Mm-hmm. It's another dance for your followers. Okay. But how about you start working on the show that you're actually in. Smash that subscribe button. More hits, more followers, more peeps coming to this show to see all of us. I'm telling you, it's a win-win. The recital's in less than two weeks. I need all hands on deck. So I hope you're ready. I was born ready. But that wasn't my news. Here's my news. My tío's coming in time for the show. And he's gonna stay for Christmas. Billy Holiday is coming back to Garnet? Ooh. Yeah, okay, I will add him to the list of VIP seats. Yeah, we just heard that he got... Uh, it's been a while since your uncle's been back in town, right? Yup, he's always busy doing his Christmas special. But not this year. He's on his way here right now. It's going to be a great Christmas. I can already feel it. Ah, my own personal valet. To what do I owe the pleasure? I work for the city. Just trying to make sure to keep the riffraff like you off the streets. Hey, where's the car at? This ain't LA. I walked here. We're walking home. Let me get that. I can carry that. Oh. Did you want this? Here. There you go. Oh, God! Oh, hey! Ow! Watch the wig! Watch the hair... All right, tap, tap. Good to have you home, little brother. Things never change. It's good to see you. You know, Junior missed you. Mom too. Not me, you know, I'm fine. Hey, you okay talking about the thing? It's okay. You can talk about it. Okay, 'cause everybody was talking about it. You know, they're taking applications down at the firehouse. I'm senior EMT these days, and don't know how dire your situation is, but just know I got pull. Thank you, Marissa, but... I think I'm gonna lay low for a while. You sure? I mean, Laying low was never your thing. Well, maybe it's time I learned. Feels good to be home. Oh, Junior is gonna be so excited to see you. Me too. Now, give me that bag. We've got to pick up the pace. Mom's got some cookies for me. All right. Keep it locked in. Yep. ♪ Here we go, here we go ♪ ♪ One, two, three, put the lights on the tree ♪ ♪ Four, five, six, get ready for Saint Nick's ♪ Come on, guys. Let me see that smile, baby girl. And left. All right.

Miss H, this is Tío. Well, I'm not Tío. I mean, I'm... I'm his tío, but... it's Billy. Hi. Rae. We've actually met before. My mom used to run this dance studio. - Oh, Miss Tilly is your mom? - Yeah. Oh, that's right, and you had a sister too, right? I still do. Uh, but yeah, when my mom retired, I took over the studio. Nice, nice, and now my nephew is taking dance at the same place I did. Yeah, but I'm bringing moves you never seen before. Okay, okay. Well, dance does run in our family. Oh, look out. Don't hurt 'em. Ha, still got it. Let's hope it's not contagious. Hey. You guys are a very talented family. Hey, thank you for putting away the props after class. But I didn't. I know. You can now. When you're famous, people do stuff like that for you. Right, Tío? Go. I got over 100 views on my last post. I'm fame adjacent. Okay. Hey, how's everything with school going? Oh, he's got one more test, you know. Winter break's this week, and I do have a call in a couple of days to just check his progress for the semester. Okay, well, if there's anything I can do to help, please just let me know. If he needs some extra study time, I can always cut back on rehearsals for him. Wait, is Junior not doing too well in school right now? It's just that, you know, he's more motivated to become famous and less concerned about what might happen if his dream doesn't pan out. Hey, come here a sec. Listen, let me be a cautionary tale, all right? You always gotta have a plan B. Both: Balance on stage, balance in life. That's my next class. I'm... I'm... I'm sure I'll be seeing you around. Yeah, and hey, if you ever want to come by and watch Junior practice, feel free. Thanks, I may take you up on that. Okay. Bye. Hey, girls. I'm... I'm sure I'll see you around. I missed you. - Me too, buddy. - Come on, let's go. - Can you get the bag? - Yeah. All right, let's go. You look tired and hungry. Why's your hair so flat, mijo? You're right, Mom, I am tired and hungry. I gave my hair the day off. Hey, Ma. Billy's fine talking about being canned. Oh, great. Did she tell you about the job opening at the firehouse? Yeah, she did, but... Oh, it could be so much fun. You slide down poles and hang off trucks. Way to sell it, Mom. You slide down poles. Um, so what's the deal with Joanna? Any chance things might rekindle? No, no. No, no, no. Never thought she'd end up with custody of the show. Yeah. Anyway, enough about me. How you doing, Marissa? Oh, we're good, I'm good. Y'know, Mom still watches Junior when I work late nights. Still single as ever, so that's fun. But, uh... well, you know, we come over for dinner as often as we can. Well, she is a much better cook than you. Uh, she's a better cook than anyone. True. Oh, um, did she tell you her Christmas wish? Oh, well, my Christmas wish is for all of you to stay here in my house for the whole holiday. So I sleep on the couch and Marissa... No, you and Marissa have your old room, Junior takes the guest room. I'm not sharing our old room with my grown-up sister. We're too old for that. No, you are not. My house, my rules, my Christmas wish. I already tried, bro. Wow, we haven't shared a room since I was... Oh, this age? Hey, wrestle you for the bed closest the bathroom. No, I'm good. I don't feel like getting choked out right now. What, Hollywood made you soft? Oh, one sec. Don't you need to study? I will. I just want to post this real quick. Dancers need to be smart too. Nana, dancers don't even go to college. Ah, not true. One of the best dancers ever, Gene Kelly, graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Pittsburgh. Fine. Hey, Tío. My handle is JSteps. Check the link to my bio on my profile. You're 12, how long a bio could it be? 180 characters. Got to be all about that content, tú sabes. When Miss H takes us to New York, I'ma do a dance in Times Square that will blow up. New York. That's right... All of our money from our recital is going towards Miss H. taking us to Broadway. She wants us to experience what she felt when she danced there. She danced on Broadway? - Mm-hmm. - Nice. But till then, study. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't finish my TikTok! Come on, no! I think I'm gonna need to move the recital to a bigger space. Maybe that'll sell some more tickets. Move it from the studio? Maybe. I gotta think of something, though. Maybe you should ask Mr. Holiday if he has a spare Hollywood studio. Yeah, if only. I saw him today. He came by to see Junior at the studio. Really? Was he snobby? Plastic? I bet those dimples are fake. You can't fake dimples, Pheebs. But no, he was, uh, he was genuine, kind. No. First of all, those dimples are only in town for two weeks. Second of all, I probably won't even see him again. I'm sure he's busy doing family stuff. Yeah, but everyone's got to eat. Hi, takeout order for Hernandez, please. - Almost ready. - Really? No warning? Hello again. Hi. Rae's Egg and Onion. Rae's Rueben. Rae's Bread Pudding. Lemme guess, this your diner? No, it's mine. I own it. That's my sister Phoebe. Nice to meet you, Mr. Hollywood. It's Mr. Holiday, but nice to meet you too. I like what you've done with the place. What was this before, a laundromat? No, it was the gas station. Oh, that's right. Oh, man, how did I forget? I'm sure it's easy to forget when you've been gone for so long. You know, I was gone for five years, and even then, when I came back, it felt so different. Oh, yeah, Junior said something about Broadway? I'm gonna go check on your order. Hernandez, dinner for four. Yeah, I was a dancer in New York for a while. The moment I went and stood in Times Square and was able to see those dancers on stage, I was hooked. Yep. The dancing bug. Once it gets in your blood, you're in it for life. Yeah. So why'd you leave? Hurry home before it gets cold, Mr. Hollywood. Story for another time. I look forward to it. Hey, it's Joanna Garagiola, and I want to remind you guys to please tune in to the best Christmas special ever. I promise it is going to be holiday-licious. Yeah, I'm gonna be skipping that this year. By the way, I may take you up on that visit to dance studio. Yeah, anytime. Hey, Billy. Yeah? Don't forget your food. Thanks. Don't. I didn't say anything. I like being back home, Mom. The town may feel different, but the people, they feel the same. Ah, the old Christmas tree farm. I'm always here for you, Guillermo. Except when I'm in yoga class. Downward dog takes a quick minute for me to get back up. Thanks for the visual, Mom. Let's find us a tree. You remember that Christmas Eve barn shows, Mom? With the big red curtain and that gold tassel? Oh, yes! One of the greatest Garnet holiday traditions. You know, they stopped doing that show a while ago. From the looks of it, that's the last time this barn got any love. Definitely looks like it's seen better days. Well, at least we have the memories. Hey, come on. ♪ Peace and joy around the world ♪ ♪ For every boy and girl ♪ All right. ♪ Turn on the lights ♪ Keep it tight, guys. ♪ 'Cause it's the season for togetherness ♪ Perfect. They're good. Because they have a pretty teacher. ♪ The smell of spice and all things nice ♪ ♪ Here comes the fun ♪ Hey! Okay. Thank you. So that was a little preview of our holiday dance recital. Now this show is free, but donations are strongly appreciated. We've got a long way to get these kids to New York, so every little bit helps. Hey, that was smooth, Jun, nice. Thanks for coming, Tío, Grandma. But if she let me do my JSteps originals, we'd need buckets to take in that cash haul. Hey, Junior. I'll see you later, Tío. - Hi. - Ah, we meet again. Hey, I got a mani-pedi at three, should I expect you there? My claws are a little ragged. Hey, you know my mom? Of course. Everyone knows your mom. - I'm Garnet famous, mijo. - Excuse me. So you're taking the kids to New York, huh? Yeah, I'm trying. I don't like to live with "what if's." - "What if's." - Yeah, you know, what if I went for it? What if I really tried? You know, what if... I get it. That's cool. So I was just asking my mom, what's the deal with the old barn? Well, let me tell you. They used to do the Christmas show back in the day in there. You remember that. Oh, of course. I was in a few of 'em. My senior year in high school, I did a solo that your mom choreographed for me. Oh, I know that because three years later, I stole your dance. Oh! But at some point, the barn became unsafe, and they stopped doing shows. I heard there's a bunch of props and costumes back there, though. Buried like treasure. Really? Yeah, just no one's brave enough to dig them out. I heard you say you're not where you want to be with donations and recital tickets. Yeah, that's true. Well, then maybe we shouldn't be afraid of an old barn. Just a thought, but what if you updated the recital a bit and incorporated the past more? Maybe I'm off here, but there's something that's still intriguing about this old barn, right? There's something unsafe and decrepit about the barn, but, um, sure. What are you thinking? I don't know yet, but... let me sleep on it and let it marinate. Catch up tomorrow? Marinate away. Guillermo! - Thanks, Mom. - Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. My first tap shoes. You kept 'em? A good mom saves almost everything. I wanted to show them to you. And this... You see that smile? Your dad was bursting with happy. So proud. It was after your first dance recital at the old barn Christmas show. Wow. Oh, mijo. Watching you dance was so wonderful. And the joy it brought you. Dad and I loved it. Yeah, I loved it too. Really miss him this time of year. Me too, mijo. Me too. But you know, it is never too late to pick up an old habit. Come on. Come on, mijo. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ Hey, what's up, little man? Tío, seriously? You ruined a perfect take. So make the next take better than perfect. What part of your geography exam involves doing the renegade and the dolphin? When I'm famous like you, I can hire someone to tell me where the countries are. But if you're not famous, it might be a good idea to know where Pacoima is. What's a Pacoima? It's a nice little city right outside of LA that needs a grand marshal for the Christmas parade. So now that I know what a Pacoima is, can I get back to it? Look, my point is, do your homework or Pacoima is not gonna want you. There's gonna be time for all this later. Believe me. Hey, Junior, how's the studying? Good. It's going good. All right. - Ah, thanks. - Wait, wait, wait. I can't, Pheebs, I had to schedule extra rehearsals today for the recital. You know this is my crazy time. So you want me to throw away your very favorite special shake that I made for you? Okay, okay, I can take just a few minutes. Thank you. So tell me about the bake sale. It was really good. We sold a bunch of stuff, especially your pies. The kids are doing great at their dances. Billy Holiday was there. Um, thank you, by the way, for the... Wait, go back. - We sold a lot of your pies? - No, the Mr. Holiday part. What was he doing there? I don't know, probably supporting his nephew who was dancing in the show and buying a tree? He didn't have any other agenda? Phoebe, please don't make something out of nothing. Okay, look, he is very nice. It's just not on my radar. But he did say something, though, about the recital and not being afraid of the old barn. What? He said he wanted to talk about later. I think later has come. What? Uh... I'll have what she's having, please. How do you know you'll like it? 'Cause you won't. Let's just say I'm adventurous. One Winter Mint Choco Fantasia drink coming right up. Enjoy. Thank you So did you, uh, dream about that creaky barn? Kinda. You ready for my pitch? Hit me. Okay. So I think you should consider getting the community involved in the recital. Yeah, I know. I've been trying. We did the... the bake sale, and then we have the carwash on Tuesday... No, no, no, no. Yes, you've been doing great. I mean, more involved involved. When I was doing "Dance Off," I used to have a say-so on the props and the design and the production, and it gave me a sense of pride that I was a part of something. We don't really have the same budget as "Dance Off." I know. But you don't need to. Remember when we were talking about the old barn shows and that Christmas feeling? Maybe that's what's missing. Well, you saw the barn, it's a disaster. You said there was a bunch of old props and costumes in there, right? Yeah, but they've probably been eaten by who knows what, or disintegrated into dust. I do like the idea, though, of honoring the old tradition and giving it new life. So why don't we throw on a couple hazmat suits, get in there, and then we can make a decision? "We?" Well, being that I'm recently unemployed, I do have some extra time on my hands. And what kind of uncle would I be if I didn't help my nephew get to New York? I... I guess I could use the help. Oh. Sorry, I have rehearsal. Um... let's get started right away. When can you be at the barn to figure things out? Tomorrow morning? Yeah. That's perfect. - Yeah. See you then. - Bye. Yeah, I'm good. We're just gonna go to the barn and see if there's anything that might help her. What? I didn't say anything. Even when you're not saying anything, you're saying something. Well, I think it's great. And I know that Rae will be really excited that you're gonna help. It's purely a work relationship. Percentages. Seriously, we're doing this? Yep, we're doing this. Gigi McIntosh... 60% because you liked her, and 40% because you wanted to go see Guns N' Roses and she had an extra ticket. 80% because making shows happen is what I do and 20% because Rae and I have a lot in common. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh what? 20% is not a lot. Try to tell me that when I'm tipping at dinner. Percentages don't lie. What are the percentages of you shutting up? Oh, you forget how well I know you. Good night, little brother. It's strictly business! Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just change? 'Cause you came in here after teaching in dance gear. Well, yeah, 'cause I had just taught dance. And where are you going now? I am going to the... the old barn at the Christmas tree farm. What lucky old barn to get to see your favorite Christmas sweater. Well, I'm... actually, I'm meeting Billy there to discuss adding some elements to the... to the show. Okay, there it is. No, there it isn't. You know what? Bye. Way too cute for the old barn, and way too cute for Mr. Hollywood. It's Mr. Holiday! Hey. Hey. Oh, you look nice. I think I've only seen you in dance clothes until now. Oh. Uh, thanks. I'm sure I'll be covered from head to toe in dust in about five minutes. Right, the buried treasure. Shall we? Yeah. Oh, man, you weren't lying about this place being dirty. Genius move to wear the white shirt, huh? Well, I did warn you. Hey, remember these? Oh, yeah, we should clean them up and use them for the show. I mean, I'd use all of this if I could. Maybe not that. Yeah. We have to make sure not to be just old school, 'cause we're gonna have parents, grandparents, and their social media-obsessed kids. Yeah, a little ring-a-ding with some bling. Christmas then, Christmas now. Ooh, that's good title. I always start with a phrase or an image that inspires me. Last year for the Christmas special, I started with this Sinatra sort of "Home for the Holiday" vibe Ancient history now, though. Yeah, but now you're, you know, helping with the recital, and in a way, we're kind of creating our own holiday show, right? That's a good way to look at it. Hey, these are pretty cool, by the way. Oh, man, super dirty, though. Dang it. I've got some rags and a paper towel in the car. I'll be right back. That felt good. It looked good. It looked really good. I didn't know you still danced. I don't. You know what? This is a great space. It is. I... I think you should do the recital here. I mean, think about it. You've got more room for the audience, and... and more room for the dancers, and all the tickets you could sell. We don't have enough time. I mean, it's a great idea, but this place is a mess. No, no, no. We can just give it a few coats of paint, and a... And, like, a proper backdrop, a few well-placed lights. I totally see it. I mean, I... I could probably get permission to do the improvement. Yes, there you go. And we can get the community involved. Okay. Okay? Yeah. No what if's, right? Exactly. Oh. Here you go. Ah, my favorite drink. Thank you. Infused with chocolate, mint, and holiday spirit. It's good for us. Mm. Salut. All right, so I have news. Strings officially pulled. The barn is ours to use and renovate. That was fast. How'd you pull that off? I teach the mayor's granddaughter jazz, so. He's kind of on our side. Nice. Mm. But now we need a floor people won't fall through and a roof that actually works as a roof. We should start outsourcing. Yeah, I can recruit some people. What about you? How about Marissa? - Perfect. - Yeah, all her friends are firefighters. They love helping people. That's what they do. So you think just 'cause we're all EMTs and firefighters that we're gonna help you with this thing? Uh, yeah. Of course we will. It's what we do. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah... Is everything okay? I... It's just... sometimes, this single mom thing is hard. You want to talk about it? - Well, I got a... - Yo, Tío! I'm officially on winter break. You want to join me for a little step sesh? I got moves, I got flair, I got... You've got some explaining to do. I got a call from your teacher this afternoon. She said you got a D on your geography test, and you weren't even trying. She thinks it's best if you retake geography next semester. No, I can't! I talked her into letting you retake the test this Friday. Now, I know it's winter break, but this is the last chance you have at this. Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I hate this, but for now, I gotta pull you from the recital. - No! - Mom! Sorry. Tío, tell her she's being unfair... I'm not telling her she's being anything except a great mom. You are studying this winter break. Go. So it pretty much needs a whole new paint job, a brand new barn door, and inside's a hot mess. Huh. You really got your soft hands full, huh? I got it... floor, the roof, whatever you need. Consider it my Christmas present. - Hey... - To Rae, of course, not you. Well then, I won't thank you. Just stick to your stuff on stage, and me and the guys at the station, we got the rest. Oh, and Junior will hang out... And study. I'll keep an eye out on him. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ Ugh, this is amazing. Your sister and her crew are life savers... Or apparently barn savers. Hey, guys, thank you so much. Yes. It's definitely been a labor of love. I love this town. Everyone's always willing to help. This place brings me my maximum joy. Maximum joy. I like that. Okay, so can I see the progress? We're almost finished working on the inside, but there's still this Christmas light thing that I want to try. Maybe I could show you the finished product later tonight? I have dance rehearsals until 6:00 with the kids. Wanna meet me here afterward? Yeah, that's great. See you then. All right. Thanks, guys. You guys are making me look good. Nice. So what do you think? Billy, this is... this is amazing. Nice little holiday touch. With a lot of help from the Garnet Fire Department. I'm glad you stayed off the ladder. Yeah, me too. Shall we? This is so sweet. Ooh, that looks good. What is it? My mom's famous chile relleno. Mmm. Thank you. I needed this. Oh, and the record player. I love it. Little holiday music to set the mood. You know, um, earlier today, I heard a fireman singing while he was helping with the lights, and... my guy had an incredible voice. And I was just thinking... this guy's just out here putting out fires, hiding that killer voice. Yeah. It's crazy. The mayor, although long-winded, is a very talented poet, and the florist, she's a comedienne. I mean, there is so much talent in this town. It's a shame we can't showcase everyone for the recital. Can we showcase this town in the recital? Why can't we? Are we totally transforming this recital into something even more awesome? Kinda sounds like we're holding auditions. Recital and a talent show together. Thank you for doing this with me. Oh, don't thank me. This is fun. Salut. Everybody wants to audition for the local boy who made good. Hey, guys. How you doing, hello. Jun. What's the latest with the re-test, buddy? Just a couple of days to study, then I'll be ready for it. I'll know by Friday if I'm back on the show. You got this, mijo. I'm really proud of you, Junior. It's like with dance... If you put in the work, you'll see the reward. That's right. All right, the judges chair. Where you belong. It's been a while. How's it feel? Pretty good, actually. Good. All right. ♪ ♪ Incredible. Go, go. That's what I'm saying. Okay, okay. Love the confidence. Oh, oh! Yes. Don't hurt 'em. All: ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la ♪ Yes, barbershop quartet. So old school. I love it. Yeah, and actually, all four of them go to the same barber college. - Really? - Mm-hmm. They're actual barbers? So that barbershop literally have a barbershop quartet? All: ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ I'm just so surprise how the town showed up. - They're good people. - Yeah. What about you? What about me? Should I add you to the lineup? No, no, no, no, no. That's not me anymore. I saw you dancing, and it definitely is you. And believe me, you're... You're really good. Not good enough to keep a show on the air. Their loss, our gain. Look, we got a lot to go over right here, so why don't... why don't we talk about it later, huh? Okay. Whenever you're ready. So I think your dancers can just come through the aisle like this. And then they take the stage, and all the parents can see them all up close. That's fabulous. I'm not sure where we put the band yet, but I do know I need to get a demo from those guys 'cause they have a unique sound, and I think they can blow up. Well, maybe in their mind, they already have. You know, they play their music, they have their families, they live in a place they love. They might love other places, too, you never know. Like you said, you never want to go through life with what if's. There's a difference between wanting to make it and not being able to, and consciously choosing to value other parts of your life above making it big. Both choices are okay. Ah, Guillermo! Something's on your mind. Oh, dear, you shouldn't worry. That wrinkle on your forehead is only gonna get deeper. Here. Mom, let me ask you something. Were you upset when I left? I was excited. I missed you, but... I knew you were doing what you loved. Which is great, right? Yes. Of course... things were different without you. I know I couldn't always make it home for Christmas because of my specials, but I did come home when I could. Yes. Absolutely. A day or two. After Christmas. Whenever you could spare it. Ah, we were so proud of you, mijo. We still are. What's all this about? I think I was so busy and just so focused on my goals, I just prioritized things differently, but... being back here I realize this place and this family, it's a big part of my maximum joy. Maximum joy? What's this? I'm still trying to figure that out. I do know, when I go back, I'm gonna schedule a lot more trips to come home. To see you. That would be my maximum joy. All this talent, and you're not even gonna be in the show. You know I'm a behind the scenes guy now, right? Well, that's on you, though. I know everybody would be excited for you to be on stage again. Please. You don't have to be perfect, Billy. Why y'all up in my business right now? Maybe 'cause it's easier than being in mine. I just... I want you to remember that, at your core, you're this guy. Not that guy. I'm not sure I recognize either one of them. You're not Mr. Holiday here. You just have to be Billy. And if that means that you want to dance for fun, then dance for fun! And if that also means that you are falling for a woman who doesn't have a publicist? Then fall. You haven't been sharing this with other people, have you? No, no. No one. Was just... So I hear you're dating my teacher? I'm not dating anyone. And she's nice, too, mijo. Seriously? I got a big mouth. All right, you guys, you gotta go, because Billy needs to get his beauty sleep. So out, out, out, out. Oh, okay. Hey, hey, hey. Leave the cookies. And the hot chocolate. Thank you. For... the reminder. You're welcome. Now, if you would just stop being such a wimp and tell her how you feel! Oh, and I might've told one or two other people. ♪ I never wanted ♪ ♪ To be part of you and me ♪ ♪ But I would wait forever ♪ ♪ If I thought that you might see ♪ ♪ A risk that was worth taking ♪ ♪ Then I promise that I'll be ♪ ♪ The hook on which you hang your hopes ♪ ♪ And all your dreams ♪ ♪ I never wanted to start a fire in me ♪ ♪ And it makes me scared to breathe ♪ ♪ It only hurts if we get burnt ♪ ♪ So if it's just the same ♪ ♪ Come on, darling ♪ ♪ Won't you set me up in flames ♪ - Hey. - Hi. What are you doing here? I was walking to get a cup of coffee, but everything's closed. It's 10:00. You forgot where you were. It's mainly the walk I wanted. And... I was thinking about you. You and the show. Yeah, I've, um, I've been thinking about it too. I wanted to ask you one last time if you would consider dancing if it was... With me? No pressure, not for TV. Just us having fun in our own show. Like a couples dance? It can be whatever we want it to be. Do you wanna go inside and figure it out? - Okay. - Okay. All right. Let's try some styles. - Okay, here we go. - Okay. - Ooh. - Ouch. - Uh, sorry. - It's okay. Um. We're just shaking off the rust, so, uh, how about a foxtrot? Okay. And... Eh, that's not right. Eh, yeah. That's not right. Um... What if we try something a little more fun, like a... like a Lindy Hop? - Okay. - Okay. Ready? And... Nah, that... that's, like, too much fun. You know what I mean? Um. We need to do something that builds, and it has excitement, with an amazing finish. How about a paso? - Okay, let's try it. - All right, here we go. All right, and... Coffee? Yeah. Yeah. Coffee. You're lucky I still had Phoebe's spare key. Ooh. You got great balance. What are you, a dancer? Every dancer in New York waited tables at some point, right? I know I did. So when did dancing... So when did you move- I'll go first. Remember those lottery commercials in New York with the dancing lotto balls? No, but I feel like I'm gonna do a deep YouTube dive later. Good luck trying to find that. Anyway, that was my first pro gig in New York. I was number five. It's on my résumé. "Billy Hernandez, Number Five Lotto Ball." - Your turn. - Okay. "Lion King." You got your start in "Lion King"? On Broadway? That's amazing. You are talking to the back end of the middle giraffe. But I... I had some other bigger auditions too. Oh, yeah, like what? I was the lead dancer on the Katy Perry tour. Yeah, we went everywhere... Miami, LA. I'd made it, as far as I was concerned. That's huge break. Yeah, it was. But I resigned six weeks into the tour. I hated the road, hated living out of a suitcase. I felt... rootless, and I was... I was homesick. So I came back here, and I started teaching at my mom's studio, and I immediately felt better. I proved to myself that I could do it. And then I chose to do what made me truly happy. So you came back home. And this is where you made it. Best decision of my life. Maximum joy. I like that. Well, I'll admit, you've been bringing some maximum joy to my life lately. Really? Really. You and this pie. Okay. - What've you got right there? - I got some apple. What do you got? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Junior. I'm sorry. One more day until we know where you stand. You got this, okay? All right, you guys, great job. Hey, Jun, come here a minute. I'm dying to dance, Tío. Yeah, I know you are. Look. Has anyone ever told you what it's like auditioning as a professional? No, but I'm sure I could handle it. They line you up with all these other amazing dancers in New York City. The best dancers from every small town in the whole country. Then a dance captain performs, and you're expected to do exactly what you just saw, and if you make even one mistake... You're out. - No retakes? - None. That's why I didn't land my first professional gig for, like, 27 months. 27 months? That's forever. What'd you think, I just left Garnet and they put me on television? Pretty much. You never told me how hard it was. It's why Rae and I are always saying, balance on stage... both: Balance in life. Listen, you know what's not that hard? Pulling up your geography grade. Just got to study hard. Okay. Thanks, Tío. See you later. How was that? Did I do okay? You did great. By the way, my first professional job took me six months. Ooh, excuse me. That's right, baby giraffe. That reminds me, we haven't even rehearsed our number yet. Yeah, I know. Do you have some time right now? How about tomorrow, 'cause tonight, I promised my mom I'd be home for dinner? Okay. Would... Would you like to join us? Yeah. I'll bring dessert. All right. I'll see you then. Okay. See you tonight. Dallas, thanks for getting back to me. Only took five days. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, but Shakira ate a Snickers bar, and we were in the hospital all weekend, so we're just coming up for air now. Okay, so what's the latest? The laying low strategy is really working. People aren't talking about you at all. Which means they'll do a double take when you come back. No, not, "come back," come back, because you're still heavy in the ether. We just need someone to pick up on it, and when they do, watch out... runaway train! Until then, just keep doing what you're doing. Whatever it is you're doing. Actually, I've been helping out with a show down here. Oh, that's great news. What are they paying? No, no, no, it's not like that. It's... it's just for fun. Oh, well. I wish I could commission fun, puddin' pants, but I can't. Speaking of puddin' pants... Whew, I wish I could open a window. Shakira is still digesting the Snickers bar. Listen, there's so much local talent here. It's crazy... singers, dancers, the whole deal, but they don't have the means or the opportunities necessarily that most people on TV do... Hold the phone. Local talent, small town on display? This sounds like a show the networks might want to take a bite out of. Really? Maybe. Could be a way for these people to get their chance without having to leave their whole life behind. Listen, why don't you let me dip my toe in the network pool and see if the temp is warm for the idea? Well, I guess as long as it's just a dip. I promise not to go above my ankles. How's that? Listen, let me get on this, okay? Shakira says bye! Okay, I bet you have room for one more! - No, no, no, no, no, no! - One more! Hey, you sleep good that way. Come on. You know, you have been smiling all night long. Like you have something to share, what is it? No... nothing, I'm just enjoying the food, Mom. Mm. And the company. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, I bet you are. Everything's been so delicious, Irma. Thank you. It's been really nice to spend time with all of you. Hey, you want to do some studying? Ma, is it cool if we go in the next room? - Do some flashcards? - No, after dessert. Oh, no, that's okay. You guys can go ahead. I'll bring it up to you. You know what, I think I will join you. Okay, Billy, you stay and, uh, help Rae. Of course. Okay. Yeah... go, go. Come on, lets go. - Just gonna push this... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Go, go. - I'm leaving! Ahem. Please be sure to thank Phoebe for these pies. It might be awkward because she doesn't know I took them. Oh! Cold as ice. Hey. Get out of there! Are you having a good time? Yeah, of course. Your family is wonderful. And so homey here. I love all the greenery everywhere. By the way, that right there happens to be from our family tree. Oh, really? Uh-huh. The Hernandez noble fir. It's over at Garnett Creek Park. Yeah, I know that park. I passed by it all the time. How does one get a family tree? My dad saved it from a fire when it was just a sapling and planted it there. Took care of it for years. He always said, "Whatever you focus your attention on will always grow." Hmm. I like that. And I agree with your dad. So um. Listen, I want to run something by you. I'm all ears. I've been thinking a lot about what you said, about what-ifs and opportunity, and prioritizing home over making it. I want the next thing that I do to be able to include all of that. Great idea, Billy. It was your idea. Centering the show around discovering talent in your own hometown and bringing an opportunity and... And giving them a choice to go for it. Exactly. Hmm. Would... Would you consider being a part of something like that? Me? Oh, I... I don't know. Will you at least think about it? I say we focus on the rehearsals. But yeah, I'll think about it. Okay. But while you're thinking about that, why don't you also think about this? This is not the way to the rehearsal we haven't had yet. Just a little detour. It'll be quick. So this is the Hernandez fir. It's beautiful. My dad and I planted it here together. He said he wanted me to remember my roots. Haven't always done that, so... It's nice to be back. Thank you for bringing me here. It's a sign. Of what? You and I... Are going to have a great show. Yeah, yeah, we are. You know, it could be a sign or something else. You think so? Yeah, I do. We should really get to that rehearsal. Yeah, we should. Does this count as dance rehearsal? Yeah. Was that okay? My jokes didn't feel too forced, did they? Oh, so good, Jessie, so good. The more honest you are and not trying too hard, the funnier and funnier it gets. All right. Hey, listen, everyone. That was a really good rehearsal. Don't worry about the tiny mistakes. It's good to get them out now instead of in the show. And remember, it's a fun show! Yeah, you guys, just be playful. Have fun because the audience already loves us. And it's a celebration of this time of year. That's right. Hey, lets practice our dance? Yes, it seems like we're always getting interrupted. Ahem. Billy, Bravo. A little show in a barn. It's cute. It's really cute. Joanna, wha... What are you doing here? "Celebrity Dance Off" sent me... They want you back! And they thought I'd be the most persuasive in reeling you back in. Uh, I'll be right back. I have so much to tell you. Oh, I missed you! Yeah, uh- Wait, aren't you going to introduce me to everyone? Everyone, this is Joanna. Joanna, everyone. Jeez, what a commute! A plane, a train, and an automobile. But here I am. This is cute. Well, you didn't call first. Not from a plane, a train, or any of those things. I wanted to surprise you. You know, people are talking back home about this. This homey Christmas show you're doing on a little farm. It's testing really well. That's why they want you back. It's testing really well... How do they even know about this? Some kid named JSteps. - Who? - Hello, your nephew? Did you forget how social media works? And my tío, Mr. Holiday, is in the show too! It's a whole vibe. Hah! So this is how you found out about me? Mm-hm. Listen, before your comeback is official, I just wanted to say that I am incredibly sorry that you got booted from our show. And the Christmas special. Oh, which I just finished filming last night, and it was awesome, by the way. Anyway, none of those changes were my idea. I just... I didn't realize how terrible this must have been for you. Well, it didn't feel great. Oh, and can I just say that with you being gone? I was doing your job and my job, and it was just way too much for me. So please take back your producer's chair. I really can't talk right now. I gotta get back to my show. Billy. I really, really am sorry about our show. You know? Maybe this all happened for a reason. Maybe I was meant to do something else. Mysterious and centered. Hmm. He seems different. Hey, Jun, where's Rae? I think she went to her studio. Hey, I thought we were gonna rehearse? Yeah, I just needed some air. And I'm guessing she or they or whoever wants you back. Yeah. - What are we doing? - What do you mean? We're putting on a Christmas show tomorrow night. No, I mean, like, what are we doing? You're obviously leaving town after this. Maybe not... Rae, there's a lot of moving pieces... Am I a moving piece? No, no, of course not. What do you want? I want... To rehearse this dance and finish the show. Well, then let's do that. I'm sorry things got a little crazy right now, but please tell me we're good. For the show, yeah. Beyond that, I don't know. See you tomorrow. And his ex is back in town, and she's offered him his job back. So... you're, uh, you're all caught up. Okay. Is he going to take it? I don't know. Did he talk to you about it? Sort of. I mean, I think he... I think he tried and then I just said I wanted to focus on the show. So. Maybe you should tell him how you feel. Rae, you're always saying that you don't want to live with... What-ifs. Welcome back to "Access Hollywood"! Is Billy Holiday making a comeback just weeks after his controversial exit from his hit show? Rumor has it he'll be returning to "Celebrity Dance Off" in a miracle worthy of Christmas... check out this exclusive video obtained by "Access Hollywood" that is sure to get everyone talking. Your kid has really complicated my life, Marissa. Sorry, sorry, I just saw it. He was bragging to me about all his followers he got because of you. Power of social media, bro. I even saw it on "Access." - It was on "Access Hollywood"? - Yeah. You know, you'd be really good on that show. Yeah, right. Look, Joanna just showed up. Wait, here in person? Yeah. And apparently, LA wants me back. Well, that's a good thing, right? I'm not so sure. I'm not gonna lie, Rae is really changing how I feel. Two weeks ago, I would have jumped at this chance, but now... I don't know. You know what, you're gonna make the right decision for Billy. Thanks. I'm lucky to have you as a sister-slash-roommate. I am pretty amazing, huh? All right, nice, Sam. It's straight. I'll see you tonight. Tío, Tío, I did it! I did it! B-plus, B-plus! All right, buddy. I'm proud of you. I knew you could do it. Now, I promised Junior I wouldn't hug him. But I lied! Oh, I'm so proud of you! - You remember your routine? - I think so. - Okay. - I can't wait to tell Miss H. Is she inside? I haven't seen her, but I'm gonna see her tonight. - Let's go get ready, come on. - Yeah. Is everything all right with Rae? Yeah, oh, yeah. All good. Dallas, I can't talk right now. I'm running late for my show. I just picked up to say Merry Christmas. Bye. No, no, no, Billy, don't go, don't go, don't go! What is it? Remember that local talent show idea I was gonna dip my toe into? Yeah? Well, don't be upset. But I did a full-on cannonball into the deep end. - Okay. - Not one, not two. But three networks are interested. Sweetheart, as we speak, there is a bidding war going on for "Small Town Talent." And you will have full creative control. You'll be able to shoot the show where you want and with who you want. Billy, this is your baby, baby, that I just helped deliver. Wait... are you serious? I am so serious, I'm actually nauseous from the heavy ether that you are putting out there. Now, that could be Shakira. But either way, we are so excited for you. So are we good to go? This is amazing, Dallas, but I'm gonna have to get back to you. I'm gonna have to check and see if this is the right thing for us. For us? Who's us? Rae and I... I'm not doing the show without her. Oh, by the way, please tell Shakira I said "hiii!" The audience is gonna love you. Just have fun, okay? Okay. Hey, I need to talk to you. Okay, but it's almost showtime. Yeah, I just spoke with Dallas. Who's Dallas? It doesn't matter. What does matter is that they're offering me another show. Yeah, no, I know. "Celebrity Dance Off" wants you back, and they shouldn't have let you go in first place, but I'm happy for you, I really am, but it's show time, so lets go. That's not... Welcome, everybody, to our holiday show, "Christmas Then, Christmas Now." We have some amazing performers tonight. That's right, and isn't it great to be back in the barn? It's gonna be really hard to say goodbye to you. Maybe you won't to have to. Enjoy the show! Look, I just... Let's just talk after the show. Hey, you're up. You got this. Break a leg. Let's hear it for Billy and Rae. I'm gonna tell Santa I want a man to love and a father for my children. And I need Santa to make sure the two never meet. Good night, everybody. I'm Jesse Woodley.
