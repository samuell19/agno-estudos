Oh God. Almighty God. Help me. Save me from my woes. Lord, have mercy on me. Let me atone for the sins I committed in thy name. Forgive me for I have brought death and suffering upon people. I tried to reach Jerusalem with fire and sword. I abused thy name and thy cross. I am not worth to bear it. I cheated on you. It is thy holy blood on my sword. And it was my free will. I didn't act under orders. Lord, absolve me from my sins. Make me a worthy servant of God. So I may be worth to bear your cross. Only by bearing it with devoted love... ...I may free the grave of the Lord... ...and open the gates to paradise. My son. Father. You applied to join our holy order yesterday. Do you still wish to become our brother? Yes Father. I wish to atone for my sins. I wish to serve my Lord and avow truth the way my eyes have seen it. Father, please welcome me gracefully. The Lord is with you my son. His hand is your shelter and his mercy unshackles the bonds of your guilt. Arise! You will live in this monastery for one year. This shall be a year of probation. A year of reflection... ...in which you should reconsider your wish. If you're serious you'll take your vow... ...and I shall send you into the world as a messenger of the word of God. As one of our brothers, living with humility. GATES TO PARADISE In the 13th century Christendom's blind alacrity for faith seemed to decline. But shortly before Pope Innocent III died... ...shepherd-boy Jacques de Cloyes,... ...sometimes "Jacques the foundling" or even "Jacques the beautiful"... ...descended from his cabin and spoke to the shepherds. He announced... ...that almighty God had revealed to him... ...that christian children, unlike kings, counts and knights... ...must have mercy on Jerusalem, which lies in the pagan hands of the turks. Because above all powers of earth and sea... ...the innocence and the trusting faith of children are able... ...to achieve the greatest works. Many children left their parents... ...their villages... ...and joined Jacques.... ...to free the grave of the Lord with the power of their innocence. Tough as old boots. Come on! Come on! That damn bastards aren't in the mood! Shut your mouth! Stop your inappropriate jokes. Soon enough this man will be in heaven by his God. Let's say in hell by the devil. Can you tell truth from lie? I think I can. Listen, I'm a father confessor. You must not give up hope. Hope? Truth kills hope... ...and not the lie. Truth kills hope... ...and not... Hey! Where are you heading? To Jerusalem! Where should that be? Do you know where that is? No. I don't know. We don't even know and we are crusaders. Jerusalem doesn't exist. But those two apes are from there. Jacques knows where that is. Lord Jesus is buried there. Take these so the pagans may not harm you. Leave them in peace! Just follow the apes, they'll guide you to Jerusalem. Are you Jacques de Cloyes? Yes Father. I have looked for you. I wish to attend you to Jerusalem. - We're following you Father. - Thank you, my son. My beloved children. I am joining you on your crusade towards the Holy Land. Come to me now and confess your innocent sins so I may bless you. Together we will cross the golden gates to Jerusalem. Father! I am Maud. I am from Cloyes. And you wish to confess? I wish to say a prayer Father. Say your prayer. It's a special one, unlike the one my mother taught me. I made it up myself... ...and since I left home I say it every night. A prayer for assistance and success in this lordly crusade of hope. No! A prayer displaying my weakness. A confession of my guilt against Jesus. About the sinful desire that is within me. I never said it aloud. God is listening. Hold my hand. So, Maud... - Ok, but I close my eyes. - God is waiting. And I am waiting just the same, Maud. Jesus, I left my home to march towards Jerusalem. I want you to know that it is not my love to you that makes me do this. To free us from the Turks. I have inside me... There is another love in me that consumes my thoughts and my body. Don't you want to continue your prayer, my child? I cannot ask Jesus for forgivness as I am unable to live without that sin. Then you have to love your sin. I love Jacques de Cloyes. I know. With sinful desire. Does he know that you love him? No Father! He must not know! And does he love you too? His heart feels differently. He is chosen by God. He shall guide us to Jerusalem. So he loves me in the exact way he loves the others. He has to support all who believe in the aim. Did you know that no one ever reached Jerusalem? No king, no knight. No one. Jacques knows the way. Do you believe these defenseless children will ever reach Jerusalem... ...and free the grave of the Lord? Yes Father! Jacques will guide us. Your sins are forgiven Maud. There is no penance as grieving for your love is penance enough. May Jesus Christ, our saviour, who died for us on the cross... have mercy on you and henceforth live in your heart where Jacques held the place. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. He will never love me. Don't cry Maud. Please don't. Jacques, why are you different from the others? Why don't you join me for a dance? Don't you like me? I thought that you liked me a little. I do like you. I mean do you like me more than the others? Why do you want to know? So you like someone else more than me? - Maud! - Robert calls for you. I wish you would be a little more like him. He always wants to be with me. Aren't you bored this alone? I am used to being alone. Don't you get sad? Sometimes. Don't you like anyone? He is waiting for you. Where have you been? You know that I love you, Maud. - Yes. And I will always. I cannot love you Robert. I know. So I wait until you can. I will always love him. Always. Come home. It's cold out here. Please leave me alone. I'm a bad son, Father. But I have not always been. I worked at the mill. My father is old and I should help him. So why did you neglect your duty? I love a girl from my village. - I understand. You left her to join this crusade. No Father. I only joined to follow her. She is small and fragile. She needs someone to protect her. We only walked for five days and she's already that tired. It's Maud Father. I understand. You followed her and she followed Jacques. Yes, because she loves him. Not me. And for the words he spoke coming down from his cabin. Only she understood. We hadn't seen him in three days. He didn't want to speak to anyone. He lived on his own. - Yes, he's a foundling. Maud's father raised him. Later he built a cabin on the hill next to the village. He wanted to live alone. Not only was he more handsome than us, he was kind of strange too. We asked ourselves why he wouldn't want to see others or speak to anyone. He had been in his cabin all the time. Then, on the third evening, he suddenly stood on the hill holding a cross. He descended to us. Listen to me. Almighty God has sent me a message. A message for us all. He revealed to me that the christian children must have mercy... ...on Jerusalem, which lies in the pagan hands of the turks... Much unlike blind and heartless kings, counts and knights. Because above all powers of earth and sea... ...the innocence and the trusting faith of children are able... ...to achieve the greatest works. God, our Lord, commanded me to give you this message. I thought he had gone crazy. And I could swear that all thought the same. I felt, that he couldn't repeat his announcement. He failed. And I knew that we would abandon him. To leave him to his confusion... ...and his loneliness. Have mercy on the holy land. And on the lonely grave of Jesus. Don't, Maud! What did she say to you? I don't remember one word. No one does. And what about Jacques? No one remembers. Not even Maud? No one could repeat her words. Nevertheless they worked wonders as we followed Jacques all the same. I'd wish I was rich, Maud. Why so? I'd buy you a palace. Please forgive me Robert. I... I... I am so foul. Why don't you dance? Robert, come dance with me. Oh, I see you're not in the mood. You're a baboon. All world knows that she loves Jacques. Why creeping after her? - A real man would... - I am a man, otherwise I'd slap you. I'll visit your sweet Jacques. I can imagine he'd appreciate it. I want Jacques Maud. And I get what I want. Have fun Maud. Have a nice evening. While I listened to your confession I realised that I was praying. Lord, give me enough faith, hope and love so I may help this boy. Are you doubting the success of this crusade? Father, I hope that we reach Jerusalem. You have to believe it. Faith is able to move mountains. I want to believe it, Father. The wish for faith does always emerge from sorrow, grief and forlornness. Amen. Do you remember me? Yes. You declined to walk with me, so I am walking with you now. - Which horse do you want? - None. - But you need a horse. - I walk like the others. You are the leader of the crusade. You've got to ride in front. Take it. No. If you accept I'll ride by your side. I'll obey all of your commands. Please Jacques, do it. The count would do the same, if he'd still be alive. No, I walk like the others. You may ride if it pleases you. - You are Jacques de Cloyes. - Yes. These are all the children of my village. I told them about you. And about the grave of Jesus. They all wanted to join you. Please speak to us. We want to look at you and listen to your words. - God almighty has sent me a message... - Now you! - What? - You are to confess! - What about Jacques? It's your turn. Well... I don't want to disturb you. Well, my child... I am ready to listen to you. - Blanche. - Blanche. I am waiting, Blanche. What shall I tell this old man. He is fat and filthy. What does he know about love. Jacques chased you off. How do you know? He chased you off. With whom does he sleep? Do you know the girl? What does she look like? Tell me... ...is she prettier than me? I think about Jacques day and night. Help me to forget him. Undress. Who are you? Undress. Did you bear him in mind? Yes. Me too. Do you know who is in his shelter? My master and protector: Count Ludovic. Well, child. Don't you have anything to confess but your silence? I didn't intend confessing to you, old man. So you choose to leave me without being forgiven your sins? I do what I want. I am unaccountable. - Why don't you confess? - Let me go! - You should know better! - Go back! I can't stand his voice. He croaks like a frog. I'll slay you like a hen, if you don't. - Should I talk about Jacques. - Leave Jacques out of this. Lie if you have to. But confess and be forgiven. Become like the others. And if he does not absolve me? - Then Jacques will chase you off. - That monk makes me ill. He stinks. Go now! Forgive me, dear and hoar Father. Dear and hoar Father. I stink like a goat. Forgive me, hoar Father, for not willing to confess my shameful fleshly sins. The longing for love is not necessarily shameful. You must think I am dishonest and vain, but I am afraid to confess my sins... ...as they include the sins of others too. I wouldn't have said a word now, and it's hard for me to speak,... ...but Cound Alexis, my future husband has commanded me to. He convinced me to confess everything I know. I swear that Jacques, who calls himself Jacques de Cloyes... You shall only speak of yourself. Father, I am the only one knowing the truth about Jacques. He is no longer an innocent boy. He just pretends to be. But I know exactly, what he does by night in his shelter. I swear Father, I swear it. Please believe me. Well, I'll tell you and you judge for yourself. Once there was a wedding. I thought he didn't dare to come, so I ascendet to his shelter to pick him up. It was so quiet up there. I thought that he was asleep and called out to him. Hoar Father, he left his shelter nearly undressed. That is no sin. Then I saw pious Maud, and I saw her very clearly. She lay naked on his filthy goat-skins. - Stop it! Maud, who always pretends to be so pious and pure. - Stop it now! Why should I stop Father? - You don't seem to like my confession. - I don't like your lies, Blanche. - I don't want to listen to your lies. - How do you know that those are lies? I know what you think. You think I'm dishonest, vain and evil. But I wouldn't be if Jacques would love me. My poor, despaired child. I believe that you are very distressed. - You can tell by looking at me? -Yes. I would abandon everything evil in me if only he loved me. I love him for he is pure and innocent. For he is better than me. And for he is lonely on this earth. Don't cry no more. A child that has lost the way is looking for the right path. What is the right path? I became a bit doubtful, but I put all my hope into these children. Father, what is the right path? God. Father, I lied to you. Everything I told you was a lie. What I said about Jacques and Maud. The only genuine thing is that I love him. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Send me Jacques de Cloyes. He sends for Jacques. Here, take the coat. I won't wear it while confessing. Give me the child. My name is Alexis Melissen. I have to listen to Jacques de Cloyes first. I am from Greece. You may confess to me later, Son. I was born in Byzanz. First I have to talk to the one leading you to Jerusalem... My parents were killed by crusaders. I'll listen to you later, Son. I was 14 when I realized the truth about the man I lay next to. How old are you now? He was obsessed with me. First I have to hear Jacques. I feel responsible for those following him. He must confess his sins before you. He has no sins, Father. I believe you, Son. But he has to attest his innocence, not you. I am no longer worth walking by his side, Father. In God's name, allow me to confess. The burden of my sins got too heavy. I can't carry it alone anymore. I am filled with guilt and shame. Sick of my desires. Numbed by the scent of death. Like I would feel the blood of my parents on my lips and my hands. I was 8 years old... ...when christian knights, who vowed to free Jerusalem... ...assaulted the walls of Byzanz. They raided homes and slaughtered people in their beds. My parents were... Go on. I'll listen, my Son. Amongst those knights was Count Ludovic de Vend?me. The lord of Chartre and Cloyes. The man who made me his possession and who haunts my soul. Go on. He saved my life. I do listen, my Son. He took me to Vend?me, became my custodian and father... ...and made me his heir. He said he wanted give his share in atoning for the crimes of crusaders. That was all I knew about him... ...until the day I turned 14. That day I found out the truth about him. That he had murdered my parents with his own hands. You're lying! Take it back! You lie! - I don't lie! Say that you're lying! No. He saved my life! May it be so, but he murdered Greeks the most! - You're lying! In Byzanz? - Yes, in Byzanz. He was the only survivor. Enough! Be quiet! Take him away or I'll kill him! Alexis, are you mad? Come on! Out of there! Give me your hand! Take him away or I'll kill him! Do you love your master so blindly? Go now, my Child. He came to the edge of the bath. He stood there looking at me. He brought a present... ...a purple crusader's coat. It is your birthday. You're a man now! Is it true that you murdered my parents? - Yes. Alexis. - Yes. I don't want to know who told you. I am satisfied with you being with me. I murdered them. We vowed to free the grave of the Lord. We believed that everything we did was right. It was the product of my blinded faith. I never reached Jerusalem. And now, by holding you, I seal the gates to Jerusalem once more. My dark love for you is stronger than everything within me. The Gates to Jerusalem will only open to those of pure mind. I always knew he didn't love me. He only wanted to own you. I knew that he would leave me often, and I hated him for that. He was possessed by his vices. Yes, but nevertheless he always returned to me. But one day... ...one day on the banks of the Loire... Alexis. Although he said that he loved me I knew that he lied. He demanded for love, but was unable to give it. I felt pity for him. I knew what he thought. Everything besides unjustice and shame is nothing. Hundreds of consuming desires emerge from one fulfilled desire. The acts emerging from pure wishes will end in ignominy. Maybe there is no pure desire. He was a prisoner of his desires... ...a prisoner of his body and his thoughts. He always looked for forgiveness, chased every trace of an exit to no avail. Until awakening comes... ...when every man will again be alone, more alone than ever before... ...in definite desertion. Suddenly I felt anxiety. I felt forlorn. He didn't return. I wanted to look for him. I never chased him, but I felt that he was with someone... ...that would take him away from me forever. Did the Count answer? - No, a shepherd boy. What was the name? - Of the village? Of the shepherd! - I didn't ask. Did you find the count? - Only the shepherd's cabin. Was the count there? - No! What did really happen up there, Son? I lay down quite next to the cabin... Jacques chased you off! How do you know? He chased you off. With whom does he sleep? Do you know the girl? What does she look like? Tell me... ...is she prettier than me? I think about Jacques day and night. Help me to forget him. Undress! Who are you? Undress! He chased you off. Help me to forget him. When I awoke at dawn I was still holding her. This foreign body. No! No! Why do you hit me? For I slept with this girl? Or because you had to lie to me while hiding in Jacques' cabin? I am sorry. Take it. That was the last time he embraced me. I knew there was another one and that I no longer belonged to his life. Later that morning we rode along the banks of the Loire. We rode in silence. Alexis. Yes, Master, I am here. You can't undo things done. But when there are evil things going on between two humans... When do you want me to leave? I'll equip you according to your status. When do I have to go? I can't remember what he said then. I only understood that I had to leave his life! I felt like his property that grew worthless to him. Therefore he preferred to hate me instead of himself. I hated him for that. But I hated myself too. For being devoted to him. This is my wish, don't try to change it. I could have saved him for I am a good swimmer. But I didn't. I thought that now I would be free, so be it. But as it happened, I didn't feel a bit of relief or grief. Only coldness. I wasn't free. Father, there's nothing left to confess. You must not conceal anything, Son! - Yes, Father. Do you wish to go silently next to me to make it easier to recollect? - Yes. I too... I love Jacques. Although I don't know if it's my love... ...or if it comes from you. Out of nothingness. As a mirror of your love. You could love Jacques, the one you knew nothing about... ...but you couldn't love me, the one you knew everything about. You still thought about him sinking into deadly waters. You sank to the ground with the picture of Jacques in your eyes. Are you alone? As you can see. - Are you looking for Count Ludovic? Should I stay out here? Come in. This is where you sleep? - Yes. You asked if I was looking for Count Ludovic. I don't. As you can't look for the dead. Couldn't you save him? - It happened too quickly. He sank like a stone. Go away! Don't you want to come with me? Will this miserable man hit us again? He is dead. He is in a heavy coffin. His only doing is to rot. Jacques chased you off. Yes. Do you want to come with me? Where to? Wherever I may go. Yes. No one will ever fuck you better than I do. Now I was the lord of Chartre. And I took Blanche with me. To the Chateau de Vend?me. I had everything one can possess. But I was filled with the though that something's got to happen. Father, there is nothing left to confess. Absolve me from my sins. - Do you regret your sins, Son? I regret the Count didn't kill me along with my parents. - Son! Father, absolve me from my sins. I heard so many lies, so much truth. So much silence that I fear... ...this crusade might be a dream of delusive hope. What shall I do with this knowledge? As I absolve you I beg for forgiveness of my sins too. May God in his mercy forgive us both. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. And now I want to listen to Jacques de Cloyes. Thank you, Son. Father, please spare Jacques confessing. I cannot. I must have him confess. You listened to everyone of us. Make an exception. Didn't God make an exception with him already? - Yes. Therefore I beg you to bless him without confessing. Then all know that he's innocent. - I really want to believe that, Son. He's holy Father. He is chosen by God. Then God will reveal his plan through Jacques words... ...and hope and reliance may fill my heart again. My name is Jacques. - Ah, Jacques de Cloyes. I am named 'Jacques de Cloyes', I don't know if I was born there. I know neither father nor mother. I was found at the church on the day of St. Jacques, so I got the name. My life began after God talked to me. I couldn't sleep, then I heard a voice. I heard every word in the dark, it said: 'Jacques... '...leave this place. Go away and lead the christian children to Jerusalem.' The first man telling me about Jerusalem was Count Ludovic de Vend?me. I only saw him once. Three days before God spoke to me. Only three days before God spoke to you? Yes. It was in the evening. 'He is not happy', that's what I thought. Who are you? A shepherd, my lord! And what is your name? Jacques. This is your cabin? - Yes, my lord. Where are your companions? They sleep in the village. Are you cold? No. I like to stare into the fire. Have you lost your way, my Lord? Yes. Do you know where Chartre is? - There, in the direction of the Pole Star. Have you been to Chartre? Never. But I'd love to see the church. The one Count Ludovic builds. People say it will be the most glorious on earth. Count Ludovic? Who is that? Who that is? Our Lord, he owns this country. Only that? - No, much more, above that he's a crusader. He vowed to free Jerusalem from the heathens, and he will. There's a celebration in our village. You could stay there for the night, if you'd like. I'd prefer to be your guest. My guest? But my cabin is shabby, my Lord. Don't you like it? On the contrary. I love it. So your love makes it rich! Love can do everything. Believe me. Love. Answer that call. My footboy will be here in short time. If he asks if a knight passed by answer him that he went on to Chartre. And you, my Lord? I wait in your cabin. My footboy is aware that I sometimes love to be alone. He will find me in Chartre. - Hide, my Lord. Did you call? Yes, it was me. What is your name? Jacques. I am Alexis Melissen. Did a knight pass by? Yes, around dusk. So? He asked for the way to Chartre. More? I told him 'There, in the direction of the Pole Star.' Did he leave a long time ago? Yes, he was in a hurry. You know exactly that he's gone? Don't you believe me? You told the truth. Count Ludovic was indeed in a hurry. Or he would never have left that behind, Jacques. Goodbye. We will meet again. Thank you. - I knew you were a knight, but not that you're that mighty. Mighty? Your image of Ludovic is so different to the Ludovic standing here. You are richer than me. You are yound and innocent. Your eyes tell that you've got a pure soul. And you're beautiful. Have you heard that before? Not in that way. Don't you like to hear it? - You could do nothing I wouldn't like, my Lord. It's late. Bedtime. He said 'As I rode through the woods, the world seemed only miserable.' 'The human being a lost creation. Life without hope.' 'But as I saw you by the fire I knew it's not that definite.' 'Be aware of your richness. You give hope by just being present.' I just wanted to say that he didn't know me when I heard someone. What do you want? Are you looking for someone? Who I am looking for? I looked for you, Jacques. Don't you want to kiss me? All are dancing and silly Maud cries for she can't stare at you. But I am different. I wouldn't be satisfied with that alone. I want you completely. Invite me to your cabin. Do with me whatever you want. I will obey. Go away. Are you afraid? I know how it works. I am yet a woman. I'll show you. Go away. There's someone in your cabin. - No. You lie! Wait and see... ...you'll be kneeling at my feet. Was that your girl? I don't have a girl. - Why not? I don't know. Maybe because I am not in love with any of them. Just the more they love you. Well, I don't know. Are you falling asleep? No. Are your parents still alive? I don't know. I'm a foundling. I want to have a son like you. He could achieve what I can't. You don't know me. - If I did I couldn't project my desires on you. I can't love what I know. And it is so hard to love what you don't know. I wished he would embrace me like a father. He didn't. He lay there and talked. Although I didn't understand all I am able to recite every word. 'A Christian can achieve great works...' '...but whatever he wants to achieve...' ...must fade facing the greatest task - Jerusalem. And in Jerusalem the lonely grave of Christ. Are you asleep? - No, my lord. God revealed to me that facing the blindness of kings, counts and knights... ...the christian children must have mercy on Jerusalem. For above all powers of earth and sea the trusting faith... ...and the innocence of children are able to achieve the greatest works. Is Jerusalem very far? Further as you can imagine... ...but very close the same. Every conquest was a grave for hope. Is it true that the gates of Jerusalem are golden? I never saw them and I never will. But if you imagine them golden... ...they might as well be so. Sleep now. I'll return. - I'll wait for you, my Lord. It was no dream. Thank God. It was no dream. I heard his voice every night. That facing the blindness of kingst, counts and knights... ...the christian children must have mercy on Jerusalem... ...which lies in the pagan hands of the turks. Jacques, my Son. This crusade will never reach Jerusalem... ...for the voice guiding you is not divine, but human. You are the only one I can't absolve although you didn't hide anything. Beloved children. Listen to me. You must not go on. I can't bless you. I can't account for continuing this. You have to go back. Return to your villages. I forbid you to follow Jacques de Cloyes... ...the one I can't absolve although his mind is pure... ...but the voice he heard was not the voice of God. I can't bless this crusade. Alexis! Turn around! I command you to go back. Return to your villages! You'll never reach Jerusalem. This is a crusade of the devil. A dispraise of God. Your way is hopeless. Follow me! I'll guide you to your homes. But if you follow him, your way leads to perdition. Turn around beloved children. You must not follow Jacques de Cloyes. Follow me. Listen to me. Believe me! I'll guide you to your homes. Oh Lord, please help me. Don't go on. Please stop. Turn around! Oh Lord, can't you spare me this bitterness? Turn around! Turn around! Stop! Please stop! My children... ...my beloved children. I forgive you my children. I bless you as hope is leading you. Hope... Truth kills hope, not the lie. Move! Leave me alone! Go with them! My beloved children. They never reached Jerusalem. Many have died from fever... ...and many have drowned in the sea. The ones surviving were sold into slavery. subtitles by Jons?
