THE ROVER Land! Land! We made it, Peyrol. We're home. France... I didn't think I'll see her again. This ship is squalid. Have it cleaned up. You're right. Cleanup! Everyone at work! This bloody English is after us. Switch tack. Switch tack! Everybody at the sails! He's trying to get away. - Mr Bolt, a calibre 12 cannonball. - At your orders. Gunner, a calibre 12 cannonball. At your orders. Fire! Too short. Hoist all sails and let's get away. All hands to quarters! Fire! A calibre 12 cannonball. Too long, this time. Fire! Launch the rowboats. We just abandon the ship after getting that far? I said "launch the rowboats". Launch the rowboats! I thought he was clever than that. Load the hail of bullets and aim for the rowboats. Load the hail of bullets and aim for the rowboats! Hell, the wind has dropped. 31 00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,995 All hands to quarters! Hurry up! I don't want him to get away. Sound the depth. We're docking too quickly, there's only 3 fathoms. - We don't need more than two. - How's that? Heave-ho! Not a sound! Otherwise, how can we follow them with that smoke? Silence! Go give a hand downstairs. Get ready to open fire at starboard. Damn! 20 degrees at port! 20 degrees at port! Fire at starboard! Fire at starboard! Be careful on the bridge! Head for land. We are out of reach. You made it. Is it the first time? Mr Bolt, the dirty bastard is escaping. What are you doing, up there? Are you asleep? Watch out for the fort's cannons. I hope we're out of reach. I have no other way to stop him. Get ready to open fire. Fire! Switch tack! Cease fire. Cease fire. I've been given the order to gun all English ships. Counter command from the admiralship. Cease fire. I'll take the full responsibility. Head for the open sea, Mr Bolt. Head for the open sea, helmsman. We head for the open sea. Damn, he's getting away. The harbour's commandant is expecting you. Give me a break. I've been sailing for the last four months. Follow me. Watch over the captain's effects. You did good, citizen. We must come to attention. We give them the documents and we'll weigh anchor. - Is it the commandant? - Yes. Come. Let us pass through. It's okay, you can go. What do you want? I am Jean Peyrol, captain of the Marigalante. Here's my documents. And I have an envelope to be delivered to the admiral only. Our fleet took the Marigalante to the English. No one succeed to force the English blockade. And you say you took that ship from the Cape of Good-Hope to here, in Toulon? I have the log with me. And the ship lie at anchor. We're staying a week before to leave again. Leave again for where? At sea. To throw yourself into the lion's mouth? - Pardon me? - I'm not suspicious. But one could think that you forced the blockade because you have friends in the English fleet. - I don't know who you are and... - Citizen! It's citizen Dussard duty to verify the political colour of all those who enter in Toulon. I'm assuming that everyone is suspect until he can prove the contrary. Especially a former pirate who's been forced - to enrol. - What do you mean, forced? Peyrol volunteered. He risked his life to bring this ship taken from the enemy and... Calm down. They're on our side. I'm not surprised that your crew is loyal to you, citizen Peyrol. This man was probably part of the Brotherhood of the Coast, that bunch of pirates that you... They won their rehabilitation bringing that ship to Toulon. That's written here and signed by admiral Renaud. I must warn you that... This is naval documents. The seal can be take off only by the admiral. You are not allowed to read them. I'll get the certificates back before I leave. A moment! Until your situation isn't cleared, you are at my disposal. You won't leave Toulon without my authorisation. You'll come to report each day at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. - Understood? - Understood, citizen. Jacot, keep an eye on them. You can read it on the people faces. They're no longer people, but citizens. We won't stay for long. - It's here. - Who will give us a ship? We'll just take one and sail away. - Are you looking for a port? - A storm is expected. Captain... Don't you like me? Of course I do. Why are you so aggressive? I'm not, I'm just thirsty. - Peyrol! - Is it for me? Cheers, captain. My friends... We're stuck here. We are rehabilitated. Yes, but we can't say we are free men, though... We have no authorisation, no ship and we must report twice a day. If that's what freedom is... At least, we are alive. We're supposed to go where we're been told to. We're not gonna rot in there. - What can we do? - Yes, what? We take a ship and we sail away. Right now. Now that I'm rehabilitated, I can make my own way. And you? And you, Raymond? I see. We're not gonna let this get us down. We'll find another crew. It's not gonna be easy. People from here are dying to leave the place. Provided that we can get the Marigalante back. We're no youngsters anymore... Cut it. - They're right. - What to do? I don't know. Settle down, wait and see. You too? I'm too tired. You're getting old. It's sad. Innkeeper! Drinks for my... for my men. By the way, where's my room? Wait, I'm coming with you. Thank you. Show me this. It's here. Thanks. Good night. If you need love and company, I can stay. Excuse me, but... That's not the moment. I'm not very cheerful right now. Even if you don't ask me to, it would make me happy to stay. The first man I've been with... He was a bit... Tell her to leave. I need your authorisation for that too? I said: "tell her to leave". I'm sorry, but do as he says. Do you need anything? No, thank you, Nicole. So, the other coins... Where are they? Here. And you think I'll believe you. Believe what you want. It's all here. Admiral Renaud would never sent this ship all the way from India to force a blockade without having a worthy cargo that justify the risk. Like a booty to bail out the treasury coffers. I already gave you everything: a sealed parcel for the admiral of Toulon, and this. Wait outside. Do you know what you'll get for having stealing gold? The guillotine. It makes no difference if it's for a coin or for a thousand. A single coin can take you straight to the guillotine. For good. And it's up to me to decide if I give it to the public prosecutor or if I just help it to disappear. What can I do? You're too smart for me. Half of what you stole must disappear in the same pocket. Of course. What guarantee do I have? How could I turn you in if I have half of the booty? - I'll be free? - Yes. - Word of honour? - Yes. Okay. That's a deal. Perfect. Citizen Dussard... Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Believe me, I feel glad, I really do, to meet a witty man. And between people who know how to enjoy life, we can get along. Stop here. Thank you, citizen. Get out. Come on, get out. - What were you doing? - I was hiding. Hiding? Why? I was scared. So as I. - Your name? - Michel. And I'm Peyrol. Say, is it Porquerolles island over there? Yes. Have you been there? I was born there. I left 40 years ago. I mean, 37 to be precise. When I sailed for the first time, I was younger than you. You're going back home? Home... Drink! Drink! See the blood? Drink the blood! Murderer! Drink! The witch has drank blood. What are you doing? What do you want? Go to hell! Off with you! What do they mean by "She has drank blood"? Drank... blood. I don't remember. It was... that night. They were running and yelling in the middle of the flames and blood. Are you hurt? Show me. Are you afraid of me too? Come on... Show me. It's only a scratch. Wait. I've seen worst. Here. She'll live. - Why were they following her? - It's Arlette. She was living in the farm where a fire happened... What happened exactly? And the inn, "Gambero's"? Now, it's called... I can figure it's "Citizen Gambero". Luckily, a bed is still a bed. Michel, as much as possible, let's avoid cemeteries. You know, a long time ago, I sailed on a ship. It was called Arlette. It's here, you see? It's here that... What? It's where we lived a long time ago. It was my house. And now, where do you live? Over there. And she's living there too. Who? Caterina, my mother. Actually, no, she's not my mother, but... It's just as the same. You understand? I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter. No, move away. Who's boat is that? Please, get down. Come with me. Damn! It's very nice. I knew you'd like it. I've been waiting for you a long time. Don't you want to see my house? Up to you. Come on. Really, I... Come. Come in. - Here's the kitchen. - It's a nice one. That's where we eat. Everything is mine. - Yours? - Yes, everything is mine. Except this. This is not mine. It belongs to my aunt Caterina. Come on. Let's go see the rest of the house. Here's my room and the one of aunt Caterina. It's nice. Very. Let's go see upstairs. Have you already stick a woman's head on a pike? Only cowards do that. Why? Who's room is that? Yours. Mine? Yes. Do you know I like you? Thank you. Tell me we're gonna be friends. Arlette! He's staying with us, aunt Caterina. I go get the sheets. Madame... What did she mean? I don't understand. I hardly understand anything she says. We're not running an hotel. Yes, I know that. I don't mean to be unpleasant, but... Please, you don't have to justify yourself. Goodbye. Who are you? A sailor waiting to sail away. It's hard for the French sailors at the moment. Not for me. Did you get back to France? Long enough to feel the need to leave again. You're all the same. Sailors never stay. In 30 years, I never stayed on the land... more than a week at the time. I'm sorry for the room. You'll find an inn. Yes, of course. But not as quiet. I found the sheets, but he'll also need towels. What's on your face? They attacked you again. You mustn't go to the village. I'm not afraid of them. Let me go! I'll go back there. They're capable to kill you. If they come close to me... I'll slit their throats... I'll show them, I'll kill them all. I'll cut their throats of. Arlette. Thank you. He spit on his handkerchief to clean my face. Just like daddy. Do you remember, Caterina ? Yes, honey, I remember. He was spitting on his handkerchief to clean my knee. And then he kissed it... to make the pain go away. She doesn't know what she's saying. She's like a child. And you defended her. You know, I just... They were yelling, aren't they? Yes. Did you hear? Why are they doing this? They are like animals. It's like if fear was paralysing her. Fear of what? The quietness... Is that important for you? Yes, Madame. Then stay. Thank you. Who's that? - I'm Peyrol. - He's a sailor. A sailor? They're the ones who stopped the revolution by accepting the gold of the English, while the patriots were dying for their country. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for some peace. I hope you'll find it, somewhere else. He'll stay here. How's that, here? That's Arlette's decision. He'll stay in the room upstairs. Arlette! Can I help you? No, thanks. Sit down. Please. Arlette. Yes? Your aunt said you were giving shelter to that sailor. - Without asking me? - It's my house. And me, who am I? Do you know what people are saying? Without me, it would have ended badly for the two of you. There was more heads to stick on pikes. Peyrol said that only cowards were doing that. - Hey, you. - Yes? Get the hell out of here! I'll leave if the lady asks me to. I want Peyrol to stay. Your name, monsieur? Scevola. And don't call me monsieur. Citizen. Citizen Scevola. I did the revolution. I'm a patriot. Let's eat the soup before patriotism turns it cold. What's the giggling for? Only a priest, an aristocrat or a traitor would giggle. Does patriotism make you laugh? No, I respect patriotism. But I also respect soup. I always said so. We stopped too early. We didn't chop off enough heads. But soon or later, we'll do it again. He's speaking alone but he's dangerous. He doesn't count. Dangerous for the quietness. I understand. Is he a parent? He was working as a farmer for her... For my brother. Is it? Ten years ago. But after, during the glorious days, he guided the citizens of the village. - And he stayed here since then? - Yes. To protect us. Peyrol! You, over there! Yes, you. Get down. Get down. Why are you always barking? It's my boat. - Really? - Yes, it's mine. I'm buying it. No. I'm giving you two gold Louis. Leave while it's still time. - Three. - Eight. - Three. - Six. No, three. Deal. Here. Now that's it's mine, tell me about its story. It ended very badly. You don't need to know more. Can I help you? Come. Clean up. Arlette? - Hello. - Come and help us. Come on, give us a hand. What are you doing? A bit of cleaning. Michel, collect all this. What do you want? It's all rotten. Don't touch this. Don't touch this. Don't touch this! Scevola! - She fall asleep. - Good. About the tartan, what's happened in the hold? That's ancient history. Not for Arlette. It would be better if I knew. I don't know anything and don't want to know. - You must tell me. - No. I've nothing to tell you. Please, go away. Leave us alone. You're turning everything upside down. You have no right to ask me questions. And no right to get on the boat. It's mine, Scevola sold it to me. Scevola? This boat belongs to Arlette's father. Scevola! - The boat... - What now? Was it yours? Exactly. Where did it come from? Who told you tall stories? Caterina or Arlette? One is deceitful, the other mad. It only brings trouble to listen to liars or to believe mad people. What's happened in the hold? Listen to me carefully, citizen. Scevola has a good nose. I smell something strange around you. A smell of guillotine. The more you ask questions, the more I smell it. Michel, bring me the pitch. Get in and give me a hand. - Peyrol! - What? I can't make it. There's things one must do on his own. - Is it English? - A corvette. It was already here yesterday. It is said that a prisoner who doesn't try to escape on the three first months will never try. That's probably true. I made it. And on my own. I told you so. Hand me the axe. When I think that tartan was half rotten. You succeed in everything? No, only almost everything. Hand me the hammer. - Michel... - Yes? Tell me, since when do you know Arlette? I don't remember. I was a child. But I think I remember... Help me. Handle it there. What do you remember? It was a long time ago. People were running and yelling and there was the fire. I was all alone in the midst of this and they didn't touch me. I'm an orphan, you know? Really? Me too. When will it be ready? Who knows? In two or three weeks. I will need 10 men to launch it. Where can I find them? Saturday is the market day. People are coming from everywhere. That's true. Peyrol... Will you take me with you when you'll leave? I appoint you ship's apprentice and cook. Peyrol! Wait! - Stop. - Wait for me. What are you doing here? - I'm coming with you. - No. Take me to the village, please. I have to buy pitch, sail... Come on, take me with you. I've never been to the market. Take me with you. I put this on for the occasion. You look lovely. But Caterina is gonna worry. Take me with you. Please! - You're taking me? - Come. Everything is brand new. Look! - Look who's coming. - Good grief! Come on, get down. It's pretty. Do you like it? Peyrol, have a look. I'm taking this. - What did you find? - Look. - It's beautiful. - And this... - Sorry. - It's nothing. Do you like it? Look. - It's pretty. - Would you buy it for me? - We'll see that later. - Why? We'll come back, right? Yes, we'll see. Sit here and wait for me. - And don't move away. - I promise. A hot chocolate. Hello, a cup of wine. And take one for you too. - Cheers. - Cheers. My good man, I need an advice. - I need workers. - For what kind of work? Launch a boat. You're at Escampobar's farm? I'm just passing. It's for the tartan? Exactly. 12 men in two weeks. You'll have to find them somewhere else. Halt! Just a moment, citizen. Is he part of those men? That's him. Yes, that's him. Are you sure? He's the one who stole my watch. I've never seen him. He's a liar! He stole it to me at the village's entry. You're under arrest. Just a moment. This man was at the square and he entered here before me. I bumped into him in front of a stall. That's true. You better mind your own business. A fair justice is everyone's business. What do you think? He maybe looks like the man who... - I must had mistaken. - All right. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Citizen! In two weeks, you'll have your workers. Peyrol? Yes? I know I'm a worry to you. Just as all women. Do you know many? A bit everywhere. Do you love them all? Go figure. Does a man could fall in love for me? Of course. But love asks for a lot of time. But there is time. For you, yes. Your life is ahead of you. But for me... It's time to go. To go? But where? Anywhere. Would you leave me alone? - But you're not alone. - I am. There's Caterina. I don't want to be with anyone. If you don't love me, go away. Arlette... Why are you here? I can't sleep... after what you said to me. Listen... Peyrol, I beg of you, don't leave. We'll speak about it tomorrow. I promise I won't be a worry for you anymore. Come on, go back to your room. Listen, you really have to go. You can't stay here. Try to understand. I don't want you to leave. I don't want. Madame... - Go back to your room. - Ask him to stay. - Yes, but go back to bed. - I'm going. Excuse me, but... I don't know what to... First Scevola. Now, you. I know what you think. I've been protecting her for years. Keeping her away from him. Always afraid... that she escapes my attention. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't realise. She's not able to resist if Scevola or you... I'm not Scevola! I'm sorry but I'm not like this. If it can make you feel better, I'll leave tomorrow. The boat will be ready in 15 days. I'll stay in the old house. Yes, it's maybe better that way. All hands to quarters! Be sure the boat doesn't get off the cradle. - I need four men here. - Come, Roger. You, keep pulling. Keep pulling hard, wait for the launching. Be careful, I'll take off the first block. - Good luck, Peyrol. - Thanks. Keep holding. Ready to launch? Ready? Go! It worked. It worked! Hurrah! Good luck, Peyrol! Cheers. Drink up. You too. Why didn't he stay with us? You sent him away! Try to understand, Peyrol is not a young man. You must understand what he's feeling. One day, honey, you'll meet someone. And Peyrol may suffer from that. It's my duty to keep you away from any disappointment. You're jealous. You're afraid that I like Peyrol more than you. He's back. Always at the same time. They're bustling about. Michel, can you see the man on the horse? You're alone, there's no one else on board. Lock it. Come on! Hey, painter! Tell me, what kind of masterpiece are you working on? You seem to have lost all contact with the world. I'm working here on my own. I'm looking for a farm called Escampobar. Is it the one? - Who's boat is this? - It's mine. Will it be finish soon? - In few time. - All right. We'll meet again. I told him I was alone. I heard you. You sort it out well. Damn! Something wrong? Don't worry, I'm used to it. Anybody home? Anybody home? - Anybody home? - I'm here. Excuse me. I'm almost done. - Who are you? - I'm a navy officer. Nice uniform. You look good in it. Thank you. My name's Arlette. Lieutenant George Real. Why are you doing that? It's a mark of respect. I like it, it feels good. Do it again. I'll tell it to Peyrol. You'll teach him. Is he the master of the house? No, it's me. Let me look by the window and I'll teach him the hand-kissing. Did you came to look by the window? No, for military reasons. Why do you have a sabre? It's part of the uniform. There's blood on it. Of course no. There's always blood on them. If it's disturbing you, I can take it off. Here. You want to look? No, I just wanted to see your face. Is there another window upstairs? Yes, do you want to see? It's here. Thanks. Here, that will be perfect. Can I see your father? My father? Or your mother. They aren't there. Here, there's Caterina. There was Peyrol. And now, you. Did Peyrol stay here for long? Not so much. - Is he a sailor? - Yes. Keep that room for me. I'll come back in a few days. That's Peyrol's room. He could come back. He'll have to sort something out. He's gonna be angry. - I won't stay for long. - What if he's mad at you? He's strong. The Republic is even stronger. Do you live with that sailor? No, there's also Scevola and aunt Caterina. My aunt takes care of the house. Scevola was always with me but I don't like him anymore. He's too rough. Now, I have Peyrol to protect me. He's protecting you? How lucky he is. Goodbye. Goodbye. No, don't do that! I'm not hurting him. You can thanks her. What do you came for? Speak. I'm not here for her. I'm on duty. On duty? Coastal watching. Because of the English corvette. I can show you my papers. Believe me. Thanks. Show me. Yes, my certificate. I went to this house to have an observation post. Not to hurt anyone, Peyrol. You know my name? She spoke to me about you, she likes you a lot. If you have other intentions, next time, you better come escorted. Did I make myself clear? You've got decisive arguments to express your ideas. Tell the young lady that any room will do. Just anyone. Lieutenant... I hope I didn't hurt you. Getting bruises is part of the risks when you go on mission in the midst of the rocks. Paquin. Perrin. Perrot. Peyrol. There's nothing. The Peyrol file has been removed. By political commissioner Dussard. I transferred his file to the Security. He's wanted for crimes against the Republic. What crimes did he commit? Gold burglary and to escape from his arrest, he attacked a senior civil servant of the political council. Was that civil servant yourself? He attacked me by surprise. This Peyrol is a well-known criminal pirate. You had the courage to stay alone with him. The guards were outside. Yes, well... - Because... - I see. You wanted to force him to reveal where he hid the gold. You didn't mentioned that he brought a ship taken to the English. That won't save him from the guillotine. If you manage to arrest him, keep the admiral informed before to take an initiative who might kill him. Or else it will be difficult for him to answer the questions the admiral wants to ask him. And the admiral would have to take it out on you. Be careful, citizen, not to hinder our plans. That's him, there's no doubt about it. Here's his file. He has to be crafty if he forced the blockage and tricked the English. Brotherhood of the coast. Wanted and condemned to death. He'll prefer the English jail to the French guillotine. Bravo, Real. That's a good argument to convince him. I'm counting on you. I entrust you this sealed envelope from which the future of many of us depend on. Let's hope this second attempt will be more successful than the first one. Good riddance. You're feeding your friend well. He worked all the morning, he must be hungry. Me too! Go eat in the kitchen. Filthy pig! I'll tell it to Peyrol and he'll beat you up! Let it go a bit. A wind from the North-East. It's maybe gonna blow for some time. How long time? I don't know. Two or three days, I hope. Peyrol, do you know what Scevola did? What has he done?? He took one of your bottles of wine. And he drunk it. I tried to take it back but the bottle fell down. You did right. I told him you're gonna beat him up. - I'll beat him up after lunch. - Yes. Why are you leaving? Don't you like us? Of course I do, I like you all. But one. So, why are you leaving? Because... I feel like a prisoner. But you aren't prisoner. You don't know how much I like you. And you, do you like me? Yes. So you've got to learn the hand-kissing. I'll learn. Goodbye. I'll tell Scevola you're gonna beat him up after lunch. Be sure of it. Take some wax in the box. What are you doing? Let me go, you're hurting me. Let me go. Scevola, leave me alone. No! Scevola, let me go! Scevola! Peyrol! Peyrol, quick! Come! Quick! Here. Peyrol, watch out! I'll kill you. Do that again or just look at her, and I'll kill you. Here you go, as if it was brand new. It's been a long time since it was new. Yes, but it's so powerful that even time has no hold on it. A hand that inspire confidence on it. Caterina... A woman like you, who has so much to give... It's impossible that you never fell in love. When I was young, there was a priest in the village. Very young. We ran away together. When he died, I had nowhere to go so I came back here. Since then, I'm alone. What man... would take the woman of a priest? Men are stupid. The house of the each is on fire! - What did you say? - It's Scevola. Scevola, what are you doing? What are you doing? Stop it! Caterina, Arlette, water! Fill the buckets. Michel, where are you? I'm here. Over there. Arlette, bring some water. Arlette, come and help me. Arlette, what are you doing? Speed up! Why are you just standing here? Water! Bring some water! Here. More. He's also setting the boat on fire. Where are they taking me? What's wrong with you? Run. Run. Scevola! Burn everything. Burn them all! Don't stop, burn them. Burn them! Go ahead, Scevola. Burn everything. Burn them all! Hurry up, Scevola. Watch out, the boat. The boat. They're running away! Scevola, look. They're trying to run away. Burn them. Kill them all. Yes, let's go. Come on, kill them. They must die. Hurry up, they're getting away. Come. Come. Open, open! Kill them. Kill the tyrants. Kill the tyrants. Burn them. All! All! Mummy! Forgive me, but I had to do it. Yes, it's true. Now, I remember. Peyrol... Be brave. It's over now. Yes, the evil is gone. You cured me. Hold me. Hold me. Hello, Madame. - I am lieutenant Real. - Yes? - I already came... - Here comes Arlette. Hello. My aunt, lieutenant Real. The room is ready. I take you there. This is for the clothes. It's a good bed. But better when you're two. And the window has a view on the sea. What a surprise! You look cheerful. Am I disturbing you? On the contrary. Seat down. Keep on working. It's not important. Well done for the boat. - Did you try it yesterday? - I had a ride. And so? I'm quite pride of it. So you're leaving. A few more tries to do on a rough sea. Yes, there's always something to improve. I came to invite you for dinner. Thank you. We have a guest you may find interesting. Who? An officer. A navy officer. - Excuse me. - No problem. Thanks. Aren't you eating? Is the soup cold? - I'll reheat it. - No, it's fine. You have no appetite tonight. - Isn't the soup tasty? - It is. I like it not to hot. You better like it cold? It's neither better nor worst. It's just a matter of taste. What kind of taste can have a cold soup? Are you staying for long? It depends. It depends of what? Of the time my mission will take. What are you looking for, lieutenant? - So? - I'm here for you. You came without an escort? No, but I brought this. Do you recognise it? You hand it over in Toulon. I've something to show you. In this envelope, there's orders signed by Napoleon Bonaparte. He orders our fleet to go in Gibraltar and enter in the Mediterranean. But in reality, these orders are fake and intended to fall into the English hands. As a result, their ships, who are blocking us here, will leave for Gibraltar. The majority of our fleet will have a clear way to get to Alexandria. Napoleon is going on to invade Egypt. Good luck to him. And what do you want from me? Your help. With your tartan. The English will block us, search us, and the documents will be send to the admiral Nelson. And I'll end up in a English jail. Thanks a lot. - You'll get out of it. - I've been there already. That explains the Marigalante. Absolutely. That was the real purpose of your trip in France. They didn't think you'll manage to force the blockade. As a lamb to the slaughter. And I have to finish the mission? I'll be there too. I'm ready to get caught. Ready to play the hero. But find yourself another bait. In Toulon, there's people that want you dead. Dussard? I hate men like him even more than you. And I don't like to have to use blackmailing. I've no choice. Prisoner in London or decapitated in Toulon. I prefer the guillotine, it's faster. I need the boat, I have a requisitioning order. And as I have to, I'll be the only bait. Lieutenant? I don't get it. It seems like if Peyrol, each time I speak with him, is jealous or something. Why would he be jealous? He's my best friend. He did so much for me. He just wants to see me happy. Me too. It won't drift away? There's plenty of ballast. - How is it responding to the wind? - Like a seagull. Yes... It looks rather solid. - What speed? - Seven knots if the wind is good. Nine with a good helmsman. Excuse me. You're a good helmsman. Too good to get caught by the English. Precisely, with you onboard, the English won't think of a feint. Think they'll believe it? You know what they'll say? Two men on a tiny boat, with few supplies, and an important message to deliver. They'll never believe it. A single man onboard will look even more fishy. The helm is connected to the sail? I was planning to sail alone. And the helm? With a good hand... Yours would have been perfect. You'll have to manage without it. You restored that boat, would you leave it to me. Provided that you're leaving. A single man won't make it. It depends. I would make it. Don't be afraid, Arlette. I won't go very far away. In a few hours... I'll have to... Go? At dawn. To Toulon? Will you come back? Maybe. But it's not a long trip. Not on that boat. But on another ship, I'm afraid it will be. What's wrong? I'll never see him again. He's leaving. What's wrong with her? What have you done to her? Nothing, nothing. Go check the tartan. And you, the house. Are you from the English corvette? I've nothing to say. Are you tired of living? Are you part of the corvette's crew? Why did you land? We're out of food and there's the scurvy aboard. I don't believe you. What's wrong? I've seen a French officer's uniform. That's what we wanted to know. Let's go back. If you don't say the truth, you won't get out alive. That's the truth, I swear. You've been sent to spy on me? My captain don't give a damn about that tartan. But he knows I'm on the boat? Now, you know. Simmons! Where are you, Simmons? Your mates. Where's Simmons? There's a man on the tartan. Probably a spy or a courier. We've got no time. There's an officer over there. And probably soldiers. Come on. Peyrol, where are you going? Caterina! You're still up at this hour? It's hot. That's true. - I have to speak with the lieutenant. - He's not there. Where did he go? Are you sure? Yes, he didn't go back to his room. You can tell me if you want. Non, it's important for him. I'll wait for him. We can tell everything to each other, aren't we? Of course. Arlette... What does she mean to you? I don't know. Maybe... a new life. A life I never had. When someone... has to grow up too fast... I was only a child, and suddenly... It's like if a part of my life got away from me. All those years the youth is made up of. My good Peyrol, we can't get back the years we've lost. And you're no longer a young man. I know that. I have so little years left before me that a single one can equal an entire life. I still have so much to give, love, tenderness... Why couldn't I give to that young woman those years I didn't live. She's with him, isn't she? You didn't tell it to me. Why? What are you reproaching me? I tried to tell it to you once. I didn't want to hurt you but there's so many things that you don't see... That you refuse to see. Peyrol, you spoke about a new life for you. That could also be a new life for... Stay. Stay. Thank you. My God! How could I had been so blind? You deserve so much more... that a poor humiliated old man. You don't feel well? I'm okay. I slept like a log. Let's load the supplies. Arlette, you must get up. Good morning. Why should I get up? Your aunt is up, she mustn't find you here. Why? What would she think of you? What do you want her to think? She knows I love you. You're probably right. The others are wrong. I love you too. I know you love me. My love. I must go. How's that? I told you, I must go at dawn. You can't go. If you love me, you must stay. - For ever. - Try to understand. I must go. I love you. That's the last one. In one week, we'll be in Spain, right? Spain, then Gibraltar. And then, along the African coasts. Do you remember the day we met? Of course! It's like if... if it was already years ago. But you give the feeling you're the same. I mean... I know what you mean. You're right. I'm the same. I see you changed your mind. Yes, I changed my mind. Are you coming with me? No, I'm going alone. This boat is at the Republic's service. Get down. Come on! Cast off. I'll do without him. You'll end up on the rocks. No, Peyrol. I don't want him to go alone. If you don't go, I'll go. I can handle the tiller and the sails. All right. Michel! Cast off. Peyrol, take me with you. Another time. Take me with you! Is that the tartan you saw? Yes, and that's probably what we thought: a courier taking orders to the French. - Flow him, Mr Bolt. - At your orders. 15 degrees at starboard. You'll see, he's gonna make it. Let's hope for it. It's useless if he doesn't get caught. But for him, that would mean saving his life. Gunner, a calibre 20 cannonball. Captain! We'd better not sink him if it's a courier. He can go twice faster than us. I'm after him for too long, I can't let him go again. A warning shot. Fire! Mr Bolt... Aim for the mast. A single shot. At your orders. Fire! He's trying to get away. He wants to pass between the rocks. - Mr Bolt. - Yes? Let's block him. Hoist the sails! Hurry up, or the launch is gonna intercept him. Fire! They're gonna send him to the bottom. Hoist the cease-fire signal. Fire! Cease fire. Too late. They hit him. Mr Bolt, a rowboat to the sea before he sinks. At your orders. He can't be moved. Go get the doctor on the ship. To look after me and then send me in an English jail... Look, lieutenant. Tell the corvette to come alongside. These documents must be hand over the faster as possible. We go back on board. What are we doing of the tartan. The sea will take care of it. A boat is the best coffin for a sailor. And he was a true sailor.
