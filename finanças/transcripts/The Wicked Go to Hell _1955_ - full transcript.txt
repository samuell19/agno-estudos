BASTARDS GO TO HELL The French penitentiary system is not the subject of this film. In any case, French prison guards are not armed. The setting, the characters and the events in this film are fiction. All ressemblance to real places, people or events is accidental. It's over. He died bravely. I don't care, I'm not the press. - I knew him better than you. - Come on, Louise... For over 20 years. Drop it. Did he say something? Was he sold out, yes or no? - Yes. - Really? Macquart or Rudel, his cellmates. This was his parting gift for Fred. Do what's necessary. Gauvin was sold out. The rat was Macquart or Rudel. MACQUART OR RUDEL... MACQUART OR RUDEL... MACQUART OR RUDEL... Macquart! Rudel! Break it up! Won't you stop? What's the matter with you, are you crazy? I want another cell! - Me too. This isn't a hotel! Use your heads. So what's wrong, did you have a nightmare? - Nightmare! - Come on, cool it! You know the rules? Don't force me to put you in solitary. That isn't what I want, believe me. I didn't invent the rules. So... - So what? A military salute, you owe me that! It's not for me, you know. It's for the other guards, to give them a good example. What a row, huh? "The rat is Macquart or Rudel." GAUVIN IS THE GREATEST SIGNED, GAUVIN If it's not Macquart, it's got to be Rudel. It's not Rudel. So it's got to be a louse like Macquart. Then why don't you turn me in? Because I don't talk, and I'm not the only one. You think you're so much better than me. I've got lots of proof against you. - Yeah, what? - Your dirty mug! Will you answer me, bastard? Think you scare me? Shut your dirty mug! You better be on your guard, because I'll be waiting. You'll get it with your filthy cop's face. Will you shut up? What, rat? I forbid you! Rat! That's enough, all right? Because I'm sick of it. You think you're stronger and can squirm out of it, but I know it's you. I know you're the rat. Rat! MACQUART OR RUDEL - Salute! - Salute. Why didn't you greet the sergeant? I don't like cops. You want a slap? Answer. - No, Papa. There's the script. I don't know how it happens that a kid despises his father's job. I don't give a damn about your gangster business! You think it's the good Lord that feeds you? You'd prefer to have your ass on the other side of the bars? Come on and answer, you shameless wretch! - It's 9:00, we'll be late. - That's not the question. - Well? - Everybody has his job. Get going! You little shits! I'll teach you...Just keep pushing! Salute. Hey, hey... That's against the rules! Haven't you thought of the director? Your head will be hanging in his window. If you're not up to something, you at least look like you are. Son of a bitch! Without me they can.. So you got out of the army, and they still cut off your hair! Hey children...You still plotting? Don't stand here. You don't look good. Do like me: Have a steak! I insist on nothing. - You know what he did? - It's already been said. Do you think I care? If I make a fool of you, it's not for a joke. - It wasn't me. - So it was the other one? - I don't know. - You say or you know? I say I'm not a rat. You know what I think? I'm sick of it... I wanted to play the two of you until you sold each other out. So What are you waiting for? For when I eat, I'll know exactly what I'm eating. Either one or the other? Yes, as you can see, figure it out. A gourmet isn't a gourmet because he likes to order. It's you that interests us, not Rudel so much. He keeps his trap shut. For now. But the way he's going he'll end up talking. Retain the position, if you please. You see not all the pigs are on the same side? Yes, I see. Pierre, it isn't that I miss him so much. At least you'll get something for your trouble! The meeting is over. Luc, go get the other one. Oh perfect hour of despair Everyone has his grief There's none under the earth But my love My only love Forevermore. Wonderful. That's nothing. You should have heard Raviravelle. A poor wretch who only dreamed of making the rows you do. Mistinguette would be nothing without him. Life is beautiful But young ladies should go to Paris, it's divine! With its bicycles that run the Seine, the Tuileries and the Bois... Where you give your heart without it breaking It's a lovers paradise. So what's the harm? Get to Paris! - You know the whole repertory, Leo. - You can say that again! Every night I watched from the wings. Where the unreal is real. When we married she performed onstage, and me at the box office. One day it began... She was in a singing contest on the radio. I couldn't even hear the music underneath. I was breathless. You'd think she was a real professional! After that, I used my typewriter to get to know her better. I paid for her singing and her dancing... Although I had nothing. And it carries a lot of expenses when you're starting out. But as I said, I was a cashier. Yes, I understand. 5 years in prison. I've noted that in a year I could be free. And her? She tells me nothing, so I don't get depressed anymore. Without me, she has to look out for herself. Does she visit often? It's a long way. So she tells me. So, spilling your guts? About nothing in particular. Did he do his strip-tease for you? Go on, brontignole! Make like your wife when she dances the bebop. Get going, you! Leave him alone. This is no time to be stupid, you see what's on you now? Wouldn't this be a good way to get your throat slit? Is that what they say? I wasn't put on this earth to do what you've done. You crazy? What is this? Would it kill you to play nice? But you pick a fight. You're an idiot, for sure! - I'd like five years to round it off. - Oh really? You'll get it. Something else to bring shame on this place within a matter of days... I could write a book! Come on, you bastard, you'll see how we round it off. Bring him in, guys! It's a living, at least! STRIP-TEASE! STRIP-TEASE! Strip-tease? Feet on the floor! You're afraid I'll step on them? You're a filthy animal! Are you going beddy-bye? I've got nothing to say. I don't understand. What did he do, The Goat? Why did you jump him? For nothing. Are you screwing with me? You lay into him for a joke? You think this is a game? I remember jumping on the other guys! When I was 15, I was like that, I did the same! Go on, fellas! He doesn't speak French. And now... The movie. You take me for a rat? That would surprise me. We should lay on his head, or at least hold it tight? Not too rough, guys. Or you'll get the same higher up. I'm not a rat. Have you been accused of giving someone up? I've nothing else to say. You think you're tough! No? Up to the moment I insist. Tempo! March! One two! One two! What happened to you? I feel that spring has sprung. Forward! March! 817, inside! A visit! A visit... A visit... Hello, Germaine. Georges...I was so afraid I wouldn't see you. You know I stay away just to be mean. Don't joke. You know it's heartbreaking. You're a blonde now? Yes! Do you like it? Would you like it if I went from from brunette to blonde? But what does it change? Nothing. Are you working? I never stop! I found a fantastic agent. We've got posters designed by Colin. My silhouette in rhinestones, my name in red letters, like a stain: "Edith Bergen"! "Edith Bergen"? Of course. I had to change my name after all the newspapers wrote about us. Don't you think Bergen is pretty? My agent says it makes me sound like a Swedish gypsy. I'm really becoming known: Egypt, Syria...Palestine... Will you send me a postcard? Of course! I had to see you before I left. That's nice of you. Yes. I've...something to ask you. You know, the till's empty. For the future, you understand? It would be better if I took back my maiden name. But you've already given yourself a Swedish name. Yes, yes! No, for legal matters. For the good of both of us... I'd prefer if all went smoothly. I've thought it all out. Did you spend it all? I make 5 sous a day. You're not being nice. I'm asking you nicely to do me a favor. I have every right to divorce you! Then why did you come all this way to shit on me? Oh, Georges... Let's not end it like this. We were in love. You think so? It was all your fault. Listen, Germaine... Time passes me by as I remember the wife who's waiting for me. Who's always a brunette. I pine for her in jail because she's thinking of me. But she breaks her word. Then she shows up in a ravishing new do, and I couldn't care less. Because I realise I'll have to pay through the nose for her. But you can't hold it against me that I'm free? Here's my blessing: Get lost. Salute. - You're not too bored? - No. it's a barrel of laughs. You're lucky. I've got the blues. Months and months in prison. Can you imagine? No one keeps you here. No. But everyone forces me to come back. The boss, the family, a good steak... But you're not risking your hide anymore? Sunday visits could be canceled, I'll have a bunch of guys resigning! You're gonna make me cry. After all... At least I get a vacation. And make sure you cool it! Where does it get you? Salute. Salute! You can't stand me, eh? So much the worse for you! This is all we need! I cut him down right away, but... It was already too late. The last straw was his wife, that changed everything, the poor wretch. That's still no reason to hang yourself. There's some good in life, isn't there? A nasty business. So it was all for nothing? In any case, I couldn't stop him! I'll explain it in my report. COVER IT UP! COVER IT UP! Guards! Will you shut up? Knock it off, you gang of bastards! Say that your heart shall be my home. This is my prayer And it shall burn through the seasons and my cold bed... That tomorrow your hands shall be my prison. For I want you... and you forever Who's so far away who I'll love forever. Say that your heart will be my home And that your hands shall tomorrow be my prison. Poor guy. King of the Strip-tease. You know he's at peace. He'll never need anything again. Rudel or Macquart, Macquart or Rudel... is a son of a bitch. But why not a third? - Yeah, why not? So you're the rat! Listen: It's you, me or Grumeux, that you can be sure of, understand? There's one thing certain for trapping an honest man: If it isn't one of us, it's the cops. Listen, I've got something to say. Go ahead, say it. If it's someone else, what do we do about it? The best thing would be to not give a damn what happens to you. For me, I'd wait for 8:00 and Jerome. It would only take guns and uniforms! Yes... And only the cadavers of sons of bitches on your conscience. What do you think of this filthy business? Isn't it frightful? Mind you, it was bad enough before... Having to cut him down, right on my watch! It's getting bad now. And as for me... The Director's going to know. I'm screwed! My career doesn't interest you? A kid spends all his time talking about his wife... Someone I would have comforted, who seemed to like me. He never failed to salute me! You really can't count on anyone. Couldn't you at least speak up? I'm listening. Isn't it sad, all of that? - Oh yes. But if there's one thing I know... The filth is there, but no one will pay for it. My, yes. You fucking bastards! You don't give a shit about anything, do you? Don't move. I'll find it out! Like what you've been fighting about? You'll see, sparks will fly! Attention, attention! M. LeMonier announces there will be religious services this morning in memory of Georges Bagot. those that wish to attend will alert the staff. And what about you? Aren't you coming to the chapel? I'm going to the movies. Men! Form ranks! One, two! One two! March! - Jerome! - Are you ready? You shit! Come on! Bastard! Scum! - Come on! - Pow! You're killing me! Will you stop it? They're waiting in the chapel! Don't you ever listen? That's enough, all right? ...my prayer... The revolver. Where's the cap? My God, what's going on? Guards! Help me! Help me! I can't stand it! I swear I drove him to it! Help me, get me out of here! Shut your trap! Why didn't you say so earlier? I wish I had! Are you messing with me? I've got something important to say! What are you giving me? A blessing! Open the door! Fast! Get dressed. And be careful! Hey, Abette! Abette! You eating here tonight? Keys... Key! Come on... The alarm! Help! Guys, they're leaving! Bastards! Get in! Gas! Here. So gentlemen, want some Super? Fill her up. - How much? - 40. "Pentitentiary Adminstration." That's no joke, huh? It won't take 40, what a mess! Not a sound. - Can you make change? - Sure thing. This isn't my day, somebody already gave me counterfeit bills. What's this, it's pretty. My pride and joy. Jestoffe! What a racket, are you crazy? Jestoffe! My darling, Jestoffe, old girl! What about their change? - You think it's a roadblock? - No, but it'll slow me down. - We'll have to avoid the main road. - Yes. It's dangerous for us. So? Do we go back? No, we'll continue on foot. Fine. Listen, Lucien: Release the break and we'll push it over. Let's go! We'll have to take the Metro. Can you walk? I hope so. Then let's get going. Come on, let's get a move on! I'd like to see you like this. Rotten leg. All the same, we need to move while it's still light out! Have you forgotten about my leg? It would be difficult to forget! We can't start off when you're already in this condition. Then get going, I'm not stopping you! Let's take a look. It's not so bad. In any case, we'll need shelter around here. - Where will we go? - I have no idea. Come on, lean on me. Where are we going? To Fraize... I know a great spot. I'm starving. What I would do for a steak. Couldn't you stop? Here you can eat frogs in style. Then in the morning I'll be lugging you around all over again. This Godforsaken hole never ends. No kidding. It's big as an apartment. Don't you mean a "spot"? A place we could settle into and then just disappear. My crummy leg! Get up, all right? - Pierre! - What? Let me go, I can't go further. I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Pierre! I'm sinking! I'm sinking! I really thought I'd stay there. Without me you'd die! Oh, I'm sick of it! I'm sick of trying to please you! You'll give me up, eh? Yeah, because don't you forget I'm a rat! You're right, didn't I say it wasn't worth dying for? It's you I'm afraid of! - Shut it... - It's you I'm afraid of, it's you! I know! Shit... Let's leave it alone, all right? Lucien, a house! Some clothes. You know you asked for it. If that's what you want... Getting tired yet? It's not easy to drown you, is it? So...How are you feeling? The bitch made me run! Go change your clothes. I'll go check out the car. I don't know what... My God, what's with this heap? Is she dead? Yeah, she's dead, she's dead, that's what it looks like. - Try the cables. - Yeah, we've... - Well? - Well? I don't know anything. Doesn't your car run? Come on and answer, damn it, stop playing crazy! What do you do to start it? Well? I can't get anything out of her. Is she an imbecile? There's only one solution, after all we're in charge here. I'm telling you, I'm not crying about it but... You're wimping out? Yeah, I'm wimping out, that's it! No, look at my leg! It'll kill me if it continues. We'll stay here, if that helps you. Yeah. Help me. - Gently now. - Wait! There. Does it hurt? A good joke! Yes...We'll have to clean it... With some alcohol or iodine. Don't you have anything? I swear... Or has she lost it? There's nothing here. Wait. I think we found it. This stuff here... It's just right for what you've got. But shouldn't we clean it out with alcohol first? You think so? Listen, you... With your friend gone, you'd better not push it, eh? And I'm getting sick of it. Girls like you never owe anything to anyone. So come on. Get up. Sorry. Go too far and I shoot, understand? Come on, come back in! It can't be fun, a place like this for a young girl like you? Don't you get bored here? Was it you who decided to come out here? It was him. What do you do for a living? Model. Model? Oh yeah, I get it, painting. Eva? What? Did you love him? It's noon! Thank you. So... You like her? Yes, why? Your job isn't too tough? She's pretty, huh? I know you like her. It'll go bad for you. I'll show you. It's hot, isn't it? No kidding. I'd like to go swimming. Then go! No one's stopping you. Not with my leg. More like it keeps you from trying anything with the kid. I don't give a damn. Then say it. What's she doing? Nothing. So what do you think of her? And you? I don't know. She's not bad. She's a little nuts, but she's worth taking. When I was a kid I loved a girl like that for a long time. It takes one or another to teach you about women. That's what I say. With her, I would have made less mistakes. No, you'd make other ones. You take a woman just to keep from getting bored. I had a woman, I didn't take one. Anyway, that isn't what I'd want. I'd want someone to love. You think it makes you a brute to say you want her? No. She's dead. Maybe she's lucky. That wouldn't keep me from loving her sister instead. I would have liked that. Eva's a pretty name, isn't it? Oh, you know names... Listen, Lucien... Which would you like better: A woman or a friend? A friend and a woman. I never saw them both together. Oh shit, I won! You won? Yes. It's bad luck the first time. It's a bad sign. I don't want to know. We'll have to send out Eva. You can't be sure of her. Listen you... You're going to talk to them. Say whatever it takes so they don't come in. And if you give them any sign, I'll shoot! I'll be watching! Mademoiselle! - Hello. - Hello. What's the matter with you? You want her to get nicked? What do you think she'll do? Give us up. Isn't it only natural? That won't keep me from firing. And then what? She's going to be the end of you. Don't look at me like that. There's only the two of us. - Is that your place? - Yes, why? You must be very brave to live out here by yourself? What do you do out here, Madame? - Painting. - Oh, I see! And what do you do for provisions? We take the car. On shopping day. 15 kilometers away? Naturally. When you seek solitude, you can't just go next door. Solitude is very nice, but it can cause problems, this solitude. What would you do? I would defend myself. And if it went badly? Then I'd get even! That isn't for you, young lady! All the same...For some creeps this would be ideal. If something happens, I'll write. You know our address? Good luck. Are you armed at least? To the teeth! We can trust her. You know something? It isn't difficult. You think that... Yes. Come on, don't touch her. Have you forgotten? So... Is it you or me? We'll see. Think you'll need it? Listen, Macquart... - What? You think she loved him? Who? Her guy. I know, to follow him here... She must have been screwing him. Then let's be careful. Of what, his corpse? There's no danger. You know nothing about women. You're so sure of yourself? I know what I'm talking about. Listen to this! Isn't it beautiful? "My darling, I love you." This is the kind of letter you send to your guy. And I promise you, within a week she'll be sending me the same thing. For God's sake, cut it out! "I write you often because I never see you. If I think he'll catch me, I'll knock on the door." Do you see what she is, this little model? "What madness, Georges... If I don't wait for you, I'll wait for no one at all." Don't you see? A girl like this is only interested in money! She's like your mother! You don't need a chattering old woman to find that out. What did you say about my mother? To be fair, it's true, so there's nothing to get worked up about. Listen, Rudel... You must never say that to my face. Understand? I would have been last in line to say it at your first communion party. Finish your letter! If it amuses you. QUICKSAND DEADLY I'm putting out the light! Okay. Go to bed! You're keeping us awake. Eva! What a night. How is anyone supposed to sleep? Listen, Eva... I have to thank you for what you did with the cops. It was at least nice of you. I'd rather say we don't hold it against you. The nicest thing you could have done wasn't warning me, it was the rest of it. I like you too, Eva. You understand? You know we both want you, and that ruins everything, don't you? - Don't touch me. - It's you who touches. You look like a bird in the moonlight. - Let me go! - Eva! - We'll start over, just us two! - Leave me alone! No! Let me go, let me go! Brute! - You want it? - Let me go, let me go! Lucien! Lucien! Be quiet! Will you shut up! No! Lucien! Lucien! Well? Don't you need Lucien anymore? Brute. Don't joke. Bastard! You're out of your head! You'll fight me over a girl? Bastard. You want to go first? - You want... - I told you to shut up. What do you want? You disgust me. Well, are you coming? The gun. Your gun, your gun... It's better if I keep it, don't you think? Let me have it to guard her. Today it's without me. Everyone gets his turn. You don't trust me, eh? Do you blame me? You think it's her that's turned us against each other? You poor dope! Because I don't give a damn, Macquart! You can eat your heart out! There's just one thing left: To stab me in the back and take my place. Poor guy. We'll do everything we can to end there. Doesn't hurt you to say it, does it? Lucien... It doesn't matter, go. And since I tell you that... We're in this together, aren't we? We can't forget. - So much the better. - Thank you very much. - All for a piece of ass. - You won't touch Eva! - I gave her to you. - You'd love to turn me in! You're a real tough guy! You take girls like that, you forget pals like that! And that's exactly how you save your skin! I wasn't asking for so much. You go too far. You see, Macquart? We're not of the same species. Maybe you're right. There are wolves and there are dogs. - You think I'm a dog? - Yes! You're the dog sniffing after the rat, sure! And you're the hothead who'd like to steal her, wouldn't you? Watch it! It's brutes that should watch it. Because a bastard like you can't be endured forever. Then shoot. Come on! You know you're stuck with me. Lucien! Lucien! She runs! She runs! She runs! Lucien... Lucien! Lucien! She runs! He doesn't love me. What of it, Eve? You wanted to last night, didn't you? What I say doesn't matter. The look on his face disturbed you. I've got the gun. Then make the most of it! That would be disgusting. What do you risk? Let's talk about something else. Admit you're scared of him too! Eva, that's enough. I'm not in your place. What do you know about it? If you let him provoke it... But don't wait. Drop it, will you? Lucien! Lucien! Lucien! Lucien... The car runs! Really? The car's fixed! The car's fixed! It's fixed! It's fixed! It's fixed! - So let's get out of here! - But what about Eva? We can find chicks anywhere! We're saved, you understand? Saved! With clothes and cash, we'll get to Paris! Paris...Paris! Let's go! What's she doing? Stop, you're crazy! Bitch, bitch! Eva! Eva, stop! Cunt! You wanted to get me, eh? I'll show you! She won't get away. Pierre, it's not worth it. Pierre, please! Pierre! Pierre! Pierre! Kill him...Kill him! Kill him! Kill him, kill him! Pierre... Pierre, I didn't want to do it. - Don't you see how she's played you? - Pierre, it's not true! I swear I didn't want to. And all because you lost your head over a crazy girl! Come on, let's go back! I'm done for, my friend. I'm done for... - No you're not, I'll help you! I'll never get out of here. To Fraize. I know a great spot there! - You're sacrificing yourself. - I'm not. Let's get to the border, we'll get out of this! - Yes. - Yes. And you... Listen. Before I go to sleep, I want to know something. This isn't the time. At the point where we are... Confess that you're the rat. For a year now, that could be a fault. subs by ironhills for KG
