This is the bridge to our village. It is the only way into Balian... And it is the only way out. Our bridge is three meters wide and ten meters long. It is our bridge of life. The Spanish soldiers built the bridge... after destroying the original bamboo bridge built by my grandfather. Then the U.S. Army Engineers wanted to widen it for the military convoys... but they failed because of the strong winds of Amok mountain nearby. The bridge is used by everybody: It is used by those who make big profits. And it is also used by those who make small profits. I first tried to cross the bridge alone when I was three years old. I am Kidlat Tahimik. I choose my vehicle and I can cross this bridge. The bridge is also used by promoters of Miss Universe Contest. Again, I tried to cross the bridge by myself when I was four years old. I am Kidlat Tahimik. I choose my vehicle and I can cross any bridge. The bridge is used by the leaders who promote discipline and uniformity. It is used also by the followers. It is our bridge of life. Today I am still trying to make that final crossing... to freedom. I am Kidlat Tahimik. I choose my vehicle and I can cross all bridges. Ah, yes; there is another way out of the village. It is the bridge used by my grandfather... when he left Balian after 95 years of making bamboo huts. I am a Jeepney driver. To earn my living I need both bridges. Sunday is good business. Plenty passengers. Even God needs transportation. PERFUMED NIGHTMARE A film by Kidlat Tahimik This is the Voice of America. For specific information concerning these English language programs... Write to: Voice of America, Washington DC, USA. Get involved in the Bicentennial! Get into America, by getting... Good morning! Darling of my life! I've been talking with John Hammersmith of NASA... about the American space program. The book is called Man's Conquest of Space. So if you have space questions, send them in to us. It's the Breakfast Show, Voice of America, Washington... Dear Mr. Voice of America: Since I have my transistor radio I listen to you every day. However, in 1969, during the Apollo moon landing, I had no radio then. What were the first words your great American astronaut said... when they landed on the moon? Can you please play it for me? Yours truly, Kidlat Tahimik. President of the Wernher von Braun Fan Club of Balian. I do not dream of Disneyland anymore, Mama. I dream of Cape Canaveral. Dear Voice of America: Where can I get an autographed picture of Wernher von Braun? That was 600 million dollars, which was about... the same expenditure for the Mars Viking lander. However, the Apollo program, was much more expensive. Perhaps 20 times that at 20 billion dollars. My most important passenger is San Marcos, patron saint of Balian. It is said that when the Americans were bombing the Japanese in the war, San Marcos protected us from the mad American bombs. I bring San Marcos to church every day, with his lion. I know, that when there will be an atomic war, San Marcos will protect me from the H bomb. Attention! Attention! Attention! Order, please. Members of the Wernher von Braun Club, silence please. Silence! I congratulate you for the bold decision in the last meeting... to accept women members. Let us welcome the new female members into the club! Come! You can give a better welcome than that! We have just received a letter from the Voice of America... I'll read you the letter. Congratulations! We have selected your question to be read on Sunday... which is the anni-ver-sary... of the Apollo XI landing on the moon. The answer to your question: The first words said by American astronaut on the moon... That's one small step for man... one gee-ant leap... for man... ki... man... ki... man... ki... Mankeend! One geeant leap for mankeend! I'm going to step off the LEM now. That's one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind. I must tell Kaya about my dream. Kaya is my best friend. Kaya learned from my grandfather how to build bamboo huts... that can resist typhoon winds. Even the angriest winds of Amok Mountain. Today, nobody will learn the bamboo art from him. They all want to go to engineering schools in Manila. Kidlat, one day you will come to know... to the quiet strength of bamboo. When I was a child we were all afraid of Kaya because of his tattoos. One day, the first American fighter jets came... I ran, terrified. I found myself in the embrace of the butterfly on his chest. I lost my fear of flying machines, and we became friends. Oi, Kaya! Today is the birthday of Wernher von Braun. Don't you know Wernher von Braun? He's that American immigrant who invented the rockets to the moon! I didn't learn that in school. I learned that from Voice of America. Ah, yes, Kaya. I dreamt once again of the white carabao. Kaya, why is the eye of the white carabao so cold? The white carabao is rare. It is born against nature. The white carabao is beautiful, but inside it is cold and aggressive. One day, Kidlat, you will understand that the beauty of the white carabao... is like the sweetness of the chewing gum... the American soldiers gave you. ...is now one of the most the popular attractions... of the new National Air and Space Museum here in Washington. In the central hall, the Spirit of St. Louis hangs just yards... from the original Wright Bros. plane from Kittyhawk, throwing shadows on Mercury and Gemini capsules... and on the Apollo XI command module. Visitors can walk through a Skylab, and peer at the Apollo-Soyuz link-up of American and Soviet spaceships. My favorite passenger is Adlem. The richest woman in Balian and the owner of the factory. Do you know? Adlem is the first person in the village to ride in an airplane. Wow! I love to hear her speak of her flight. Sometimes, instead of taking money, I ask her to repeat the story of how it feels... to fly in the sky. My sister Alma, she is smart. She goes her own way. Not like the boys... always competing. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Now the latest news. Today world leaders arrived to attend the Te Deum ceremonies... for a dying dictator. The Generalissimo finally died after severe loss of energy. He was 80 years old. In another summit meeting, here just south of Manila, international Scout leaders arrived on Jamboree Island, to discuss international inflation. The American delegate... The American delegate was the last to arrive. There was general agreement on most of the American proposals. Except the last demand. I think the American delegation should be in charge... of the project. If America cannot lead this project... American funds are withdrawn. Will the organization survive without American participation? Hi, Joe. Got some chewing gum? Manila! Stop. Stop! I can't stand pigs. Day number four for Secretary Kissinger, inside Africa... After having enunciated a new US policy toward Africa, the Secretary had these airport remarks on his arrival: There is the search for racial justice... There is the attempt by outside power to divide Africa... into hostile blocks. And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress. And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress... And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress. And there is the need of African nations to achieve progress... How far to Manila? We are 20 km from Manila. Kidlat, who would you want to meet most in America? In America I would like to meet Wernher von Braun. The man who built the bridge to the moon. Kidlat, why do you admire America so much? Because in America I could become an astronaut. Here, I am only a jeepney driver. All these bright-colored taxis, where do they come from? These are vehicles of war which we made into vehicles of life. This is Sarao Motors. The biggest Filipino car manufacturer. Despite the oil crisis, Sarao increased car production by 20% from last year. Today, Sarao rolls out five jeepneys per week. An old jeepney never dies. It finds its way into a hundred new jeepneys. Kidlat. Kidlat, I want to bring a Philippine- made jeepney with me when I leave. I think... I might just bring a Philippines chauffeur along. Alma, look what I brought you! An Americano gave me dollars. Alma, you are the master of your vehicle. Only you can tell it where to go. So, Kidlat, you go with the Americano? You're like your father. Fascinated by the white man's smile. Do not worry, Mama. I will become rich in America... and I will take you away from here. Kidlat, your father was a happy taxi driver. He always sang as he worked. One day, a smiling stranger gave him a rifle. "The bridge to your freedom..." "Your vehicle to freedom." "We will help you in your revolution against the Spanish tyrants." Said the smiling Americano. Your father stopped singing. He fought in the revolution and the days of the Spaniards were numbered. When the Spaniards surrendered, your father sang again. As he sang the sweet song of victory, the Americans were buying us in Paris. Your singing father tried to enter liberated Manila at the San Juan bridge. He was stopped by an American sentry. It was his last song. From the butt of your father's rifle I carved this horse. "Killed for trespassing on US property". Was the military report attached to his corpse. For twelve million dollars we became US military property. Yes, Kidlat. For twelve million dollars they bought your soul and mine. That was the official military version... of your father's death. The facts are suppressed to hide our true strength. Kidlat, it's time you know the truth. I was there. I saw it all happen. He did not need his rifle. Your father took a deep breath... He blew with a fury that knocked the guard down. He's stronger than the winds of Amok Mountain, Kidlat. Fifteen more Americans fell before they finally stopped your father. Kidlat, when the typhoon blows off... its cocoon, the butterfly embraces the sun. The sleeping typhoon must learn to blow again. Kaya, I now recall. I first saw the white carabao somewhere here. Many years ago, on the day that I became a man. Leandro was the first to volunteer. I was no hero. My balls jingled like ice cream bells. Hermes had a hard time. My best friend Eric went through it quietly. When your best friend goes through hell, it is difficult to remain behind. My turn came next. At the end of the day, five of us had become men. While they were hammering at me... I could not take my eyes off a strange leafless tree. The white carabao stared so coldly I felt no pain. We're leaving on Sunday, the Americano and I. He takes me to Paris, where his business is. He said we stay there for a year and then we go to New York. I need six passport photos. Passport? I don't know what's a passport. He just said six passport photos. I must thank the Virgin Mary. I will push my jeepney all day. O holy Mary! Thank you for granting my prayers! Forgive me for not beating myself as in previous years. We leave on Sunday, my wounds would not heal on time. Kidlat, stop apologizing! You know my job here is a bore. But there are a few among you who make my day. Like Anselmo, the ice cream man. Every year he likes to play my son with his cast of thousands. A real superstar! Then there is Giorgio, the biggest sinner in town. Even with his mask, who wouldn't recognize him? And then there is Clara, vowing annually to give up coconut sweets. But the moment she hears your chain gang coming... wow! The chains flip her appetite. And you, dear Kidlat. Remember the first year you wanted to fly? Can I forget that at five years you started using the chains... praying for a toy jet plane? And last year the thread mask - how sexy! That year you fell from the mango tree and broke your back? You locked yourself in the ice factory. When they pulled you out, you were as hard as Judas' prick. Kidlat, you're okay in my book. See you in Lourdes, huh? Children! Concentrate! Last day of practice... One, two, three, four... Kidlat... take this horse on your travels. One day you might need him to help you find the path to freedom. Thank you beloved friends of Balian. I can only promise you, when I become rich in America... I will donate a traffic light for our bridge! Sir, your jeep awaits you at the customs zone. Sir, upon disembarking, proceed to the customs official. Welcome to France. Do you have anything to declare? Come, Kidlat. Come. One.. two... three... four, five, six bridges! Bridges! Bridges, bridges! Everywhere bridges! Dearest Mama, I arrived safely in Paris. You cannot imagine what world lies out here. Floors walk for you! Doors open for you! And so many bridges... Do you know Paris has 26 bridges? Why can't we have progress like this? Your loving son, Kidlat. Chateau de la France was once surrounded by beautiful woods. Today, it's a bit different. Kidlat, you will live in the North tower. This is your room, Kidlat. Unbelievable! In that small room were enough things to fill up five bamboo huts! Let me show you the splendid sights of my Paris. On this side is the Sacr? Coeur. I have 340 machines in that area. Uh... 341. Over here, the Eiffel Tower. You can't see the Eiffel Tower because of the giant supermarket. I have 675 machines. That's Montparnasse, the tallest building of Paris. 425 machines. Quartier Latin: 543. Bastille: That's the communist quartier! I have no machines there. And for your stay here, I present you a welcome gift. A pocket camera and transistor radio combined. In case you ever get homesick. This button gives you American language broadcasts. You begin working tomorrow. Ah! How wonderful to be in paradise. If only my friends could see me here! If only I had a friend. Huh? Two yolks? Again? Incredible! Six eggs... Twelve yolks! I went back to the vendor to ask why all the eggs had double yolks. "All my eggs have the same grandfather", she said. "Today, everybody gets cheap synthetic eggs from that supermarket." "We are the last merchants of the Four Seasons". I looked at the supermarket and I was frightened. I told Lola my mother carved a horse to remember my father. Ah, Kidlat! "Your mother is wise to know... "a simple tribute is more powerful... "than the giant monuments of our civilization". Dear members of the Wernher von Braun Club: Thank you for sending me the annual report of the club. I think of you often, and I miss our noisy meetings. I am happy to hear the club sold 5000 ice cream cones last month. To make the last money needed for your Space Day fiesta. I am sure it will be a big success. Thank you also for designating me honorary chairman of the beauty contest. I regret that I cannot be there to escort... your selected Queen of Progress. But I will be there in spirit. The project should be ready in time for the landing of the Viking on Mars. Do not worry if the statue does not look like our hero. As long as it faces Cape Canaveral. America is not far away, Kidlat, if you work faster. I've worked a lifetime to build my chewing gum empire. The time has come to move on. I'm buying a blue jeans factory... when I can sell the chewing gum business profitably. That's progress, my boy! First the chewing gum... Then the jeans! And one day, the army jeeps and jets. Progress, my boy. Progress! I practice my French every day, in the streets. Today I got my first French kiss. Bretons give four kisses... Alsatians give three. Lola gives me seven French kisses. Lola was worried. She spoke of a bad dream. Kidlat, I fear it is my last season. We told Coco, the cherry vendor, of Lola's bad dream. When I joked about Lola's phantom, Coco scolded me. "Kidlat, Lola's nightmare is no joke". What would you do if you were the last merchant of the Four Seasons... and someone took your goods from you? Do not worry, Lola. We'll fight all the egg phantoms together. My first vacation! The boss gave me one week. I will make a pilgrimage to the land of Wernher von Braun. There was this pregnant Bavarian girl. She taught me a German word. "Zwiebel". "Onion". "Zwiebelturm". "Onion tower". "That Zwiebelturm goes up on Sunday", she said. When I told them my jeep was made by hand they all became sad. "This is the last handcrafted Zwiebelturm", said one old man. "The next Zwiebelturms will be factory-made". Five ready-made Zwiebelturms per hour. How strange! I could not understand how these old men... could be so sentimental about the old technologies. As that seven-ton onion lifted so easily into the sky... I felt proud to be president of the Wernher von Braun club. When I left Germany... the first Kidlat on this side of the planet had been born. Funny, I thought the baby looked a little bit like me. Driving home on the German autobahn... with little Kidlat in my mind... The jeep went faster, and faster! And I felt I was getting lighter... and lighter, and lighter! What a nice feeling! When I got to Paris the supermarket had grown two blocks longer. Stop crying, Kidlat! Stop crying like a baby! One market vendor less means one parking space more. Progress, my boy. The ghost of progress visited us. Dear Kidlat, how are you? Do you remember the forest where you became a man? The government razed down the trees... to make way for a new highway for tourists. Who will stop this madness? Viking I has landed on the surface of Mars. Yesterday I helped your mother move her house. We walked all day. But no matter how far we walked it was never far enough. Everywhere we went... we could not avoid the planter of new forest. Kidlat, one day you will come to know... the quiet strength of bamboo. "Quiet strength of bamboo". That is why we have no progress! Kaya, you still refuse to see why bamboo art is doomed to extinction. I am living in a tower that is 500 years old! And it will survive another 500 typhoons and earthquakes! Kaya, you cannot build rocket ships from bamboo! Look there, Kidlat, by the supermarket. Those are super chimneys for burning the garbage of Paris. An extra service of the supermarket. Ten super chimneys, Kidlat. Made of plastic quickly assembled. And too close to my chateau for comfort! We must leave Paris before those chimneys start spitting smoke. Incredible! Inside a chimney was enough room for three families! Imagine, thirty people living in each chimney! Three hundred people. That's half of my village! Today, world leaders started arriving in Paris... for the inauguration of the supermarket. The big question is: Who will be Miss Supermarket of 1976? I've sold the chewing gum business! That's the last machine you load. You can keep your favorite chewing gum machine... for a souvenir. I went to my favorite chewing gum machine. I found her empty. There are many VIP's in town. You will meet them at my farewell party tomorrow. Men more godly than your Wernher von Braun. Right after the party we fly to America! On the Concorde. You will be the first Filipino to fly supersonic. Tomorrow, Kidlat, tomorrow! You shall be with me in paradise! Paradise. Will it be the paradise I prayed for? Will it be the paradise I dreamed of? Congratulations, children of the fatherland! The day of glory has arrived! Liberty! Equality! Brotherhood! Supermarket! Don't get too impressed, Kidlat. Wait until America. Where everything is even more super! If the small chimneys work, why the super chimneys? If the small markets work, why supermarkets? If small airplanes work... Why super flying machines? Aha! My friends arriving. Come, Kidlat. Meet my friends. Big personalities you hear on your little radio... in the Philippines. Why is everybody staring at me? I feel I'm becoming smaller. Kidlat... The first Filipino to fly supersonic... I am Kidlat Tahimik. I am not as small as you think. Nothing can stop me from crossing my bridge! When the typhoon blows off its cocoon... the butterfly embraces the sun. This is the last will and testament of Kidlat Tahimik. And a declaration of independence. I, Kidlat Tahimik, of my own free will... hereby resign as president of the Wernher von Braun Club. And relinquish all rights and duties as president and founder of the club. Furthermore, I totally resign my membership from the club. This resignation is absolute irrevocable. And is effective now. I declare myself independent... from those who would build bridges to the stars. Where is your truest friend, Kidlat? Where is your real strength? The sleeping typhoon must learn to blow again. I am Kidlat Tahimik. I choose my vehicle. I choose my bridge. When the typhoon blows off its cocoon... the butterfly embraces the sun. subtitles: scalisto for KG
