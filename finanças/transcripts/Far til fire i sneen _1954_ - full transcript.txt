Come and help me, Ole has fallen on his knees! - It's not that dangerous. - Yes! Because he has his head down! Help! Help! What are you doing, man? - Who? - You! - Me? - Yes. - I fell on my head in the snow. - What did you do? Shame... Then it was just a dream. (alarm clock rings) - We're getting up! - It's only half past seven. Well, it's dad's birthday today. Yes, ouch! It is, after all! - Picky boo, here I am! - Shh, Peter. Will you then be quiet! Yes, little Sis. Look, I can jump three steps. Almost so. - Did you see that? - Nah, but I heard it. - You know you must not wake father. - Shouldn't more lights be on? - We can't have 50, so put one for every ten years. - It's cheating! - Good morning. What a lovely pretzel! - Good morning. Are you so ready? I have been ready for a long time. Where is my cigar? Here. I have taken two and a half in your piggy bank. That was expensive! Are you sure they haven't tricked you? Of course. Do you have the tone of our song? - Congratulations. Congratulations...! - Be quiet! - Who will carry what? - Ole takes the pretzel. - You take the coffee and I take the tray. - And I'll take the toothpicks. - Hi, hi, hi. - Shhh! - Turn on the lights, Per. - It won't do, get another one. Father is sleeping. It's completely quiet. See, it could. We'll save that for another time. Are you ready? Come on! Congratulations, congratulations, wake up, little father because it is today that your birthday is we will bring presents and you will be satisfied because it's not every day that you turn fifty - Hooray, hooray, hooray! - And then the long haul! Hooray! Thank you so much, that's too much. - You haven't got anything yet! - Nah, but the day starts so well. - Mie and I made the song ourselves. - Yes, I could hear that. - Now you have to have your coffee, little father. - I want to give a speech first. You must hold it tonight first. I don't want to, because Uncle Anders is always laughing. Just bring it on, daddy's girl. Let me warm up. It's a long speech, she practiced it for 4 days. Dear father. On behalf of our loved ones and ourselves, we would like to say thank you for turning fifty. We all love you so much. And you have been a good father to us for all these fifty years. That's why we would like to on the feast day... - don't howl! - No, I can't do it anymore! - That was very beautiful, daddy's girl. - I knew she was going to start crying. I think you should give dad your present. She has knitted a tie for you. Green and red! Thank you very much. - And here is a pipe stand, I made it. - And here is a folder, the old one wasn't pretty anymore. - It's from me to you. - An Apostolado! It has been expensive! I have scratched off the price so you can't see, it cost 2,5 crowns. Now dad needs his coffee. Go with you. - So you can't be familiar with that. - We might as well get a little something to eat. It can be done afterwards. We only have one bathroom. So go with you! So you can't be familiar with that! Is my big girl in a bad mood? Aren't you still wondering about him? No, it just annoys me, he was him, who broke up. I would have done it myself. Well, it's nothing but sore vanity? There are so many good young people. You'll probably find someone else one day. No, Dad, I'm done with men. - Are you thinking of going to a monastery? - Not until Little Peter has grown up. Then there is a good time! (the doorbell rings) It's probably Uncle Anders. He would stop by before you left. - Who was it that broke up with Sis? - It was nothing. Otherwise he could get a few on the forehead. Hello. Well, is that you? Good morning and best wishes for your father. Thank you. - Is the birthday child up? - Partly. Dad? Mrs. Sejersen is here to say congratulations. Show Mrs. Sejersen into the living room. I'll be there soon. I'm happy to wait. I have plenty of time. I have a small plant for your father. - I see. - I drove it forward myself. A moment. - Are you looking for dust? - No, dear little boy... - My name is per! - You do that too. - Take a chair and sit down. - Yes, please. Surely they'll have a full house tonight? Only Uncle Anders will come. - You don't have to go. - Per! That wasn't nice! You said yourself: "In any case, I don't want Mrs. Sejersen with." I have not for a moment thought of being asked, not here for that. We know that well. - A moment. - Be preserved! Good morning, Uncle Anders! Good morning, and congratulations with the old man there! Yes, thanks for that. - Mrs Sejersen is sitting in there. - Oh, her! Yes, whoa whoa. Look, here I have a bottle of red wine for dinner. And here's one we can tackle now. So early in the day! Now I have to get glasses. If there is to be a party, then let there be a party! - Good morning, good morning! - We are probably fresh in the morning! - Yes, it's a big day. - Yes, that's true enough. Good morning, Little Per! Where is your elephant? - It's over there in the corner of shame. - But damn it! What has it done? - It has spoken profanity. - Oh, what a darn! - No, real swear words! - You don't know stuff like that. - Yes, you mustn't say damn it. - Fuck you! But you can say, for example, as long as you don't say it too often. Yes, there is something there! - Good morning, dear friend! - Very hearty congratulations! - I have a small plant with me. - I have bottles. - Nah, nah, the birthday child first. - I have to go to the office... It's fine. Cheers, you old man! Congratulations! Should we let Grandpa win? Hooray, hooray, hooray! Cheers! Howdy, Uncle Anders. Father, if we are to be followed, you must come now. Is it that late? Then I must excuse myself. That was a strange tie you are wearing. - Isn't it a bit colorful? - Well, do you think so? Mie has knitted it herself, and it's some pretty colours, we think. - It's my birthday present. - Aah, yes, yes. - Do you want to go to town? - I'll stay and enjoy myself a bit. - They're not in a hurry either, are they? - Me? No. Then I go. Thank you for coming. Come on, boy! You have plenty of time when you get to our age. They are probably a bit older than me. Yes, maybe a month. Cheers! - Be so kind, Mr. Birthday boy. - Thank you, my boy. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Dad. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Do you now think you can handle yourself? - Thanks, it's fine. Don't you know when you have to go over? At green! You must promise me never to do that again. - No, sorry. - Aah, I beg. Run away. - In the middle of the street...! - Cab! I have no idea what the case is about. What do you want with my name and address? They are the ideal road user. We have been looking for him for a fortnight, and now we have found you. They get a free holiday trip to Norway. A week's stay at a ski hotel. - At the magazine's expense! Get it? - Turn around. I need a picture. I should have been in my office seven minutes ago. And I turn fifty years old today. The staff has probably arranged a small reception. - Congratulations! - Thank you. You! That's bravo! "Chief treasurer wins trip on his fiftieth birthday!" We take him into the office. Wreath cake and raised glasses! It is perfectly fine. - The director will not like that. - He will be delighted! It's service! We name his company. What more could he ask for? Well, it won't work, the one with Norway. I can't ski either. It doesn't matter. Then enjoy nature! I am a widower and I have four children. I can't leave them like that. "Father of four!" Hold on to him! Look kind of happy, don't you? And relax. They have to see, everything will be fine. The editor-in-chief would like to greet you. Good luck with the day and with the journey. Thanks, but unfortunately I can't travel. Of course you can travel. Ekstra Gazette invites you and your sweet children. - Well, the two of them go to school. - It does not matter. We'll fix that. Now let's see... Can you see the children playing over there? - There they are. - Well, thank you very much, headmaster. Goodbye. Hello there! Which of you is Mie and Ole? We need a picture of you. - Why? - I am going on winter holiday to Norway. Couldn't you look a little intelligent, Ole? We wanted a big smile. Is it true? When should we travel? - Soon. Is there anyone at your house? - Yes. - Do you have it? - Fine, fine. - Goodbye, boy. - Goodbye. It was what I dreamed of! Yes! There's no one at home! We don't have to buy anything we have! Hear, let's get inside, bro. - Your name is Per, right? - Yes. But it wasn't me who slammed that window into Mrs. Sejersen's. No! We just need to take a picture of you. No thanks. We should have had one for Christmas, but it was too expensive. - Well? This costs nothing at all. - No, not a trace. - Is it free? - Yes. Yes. Otherwise, there is not much that is. No. Shall we go inside? - Yes, go ahead. - Thank you. You're a big boy, aren't you? You know what a newspaper is. Yes, they are used for turning up a fire. Take a chair and sit down, and I'll get a cigar. Thank you. And then they say, modern children are not well behaved! - Well, you're going to Norway for eight days. - You are welcome to take over that job. I only have one cigar, so I have to break it in half. - That would be a shame. - It tastes equally good on both ends. I don't know if you can handle smoking a chocolate cigar at that time of day. Nah, I don't think so. Well, you have to be careful. You'd rather smoke it yourself. I would also prefer that. - Where is your sister? - Little Sis? - She is not home. - Well then, we have to take you. If I have to be photographed, I have to have Bodil Kjaer with me. - Bodil Kjaer? - Is she here? Yes, she is standing outside in the kitchen drinking milk. Here she is. Is your elephant called Bodil Kjaer? - Yes, who else did you think it was? - Yes, who else did you think it was? Don't you have a picture of your sister? Yes, now I have to find one. - Here she is. - Is that your sister? Yes, yes... Come on, we'll take a picture of you. Good evening, little Mie. Is father at home? Not yet, but Sis is upstairs. She cries. - But! - Now I have to take your hat and cane. - Why is she crying though? - Because she is so upset. Good evening, little Sis, and thank you for yesterday. I wish I was dead. Have you seen the newspaper? - Yes, it was very funny. - Everyone in the neighborhood thinks so. - I am completely rediculed. - Because of your cute baby picture? Well, I have no clothes on! What would you say if all people were to see you nude on a fur rug? I? Ho, ho, ho! It would probably look a bit unappealing! Now you paint it so strongly again. - I don't want to show myself anywhere. - Then it is good that you are going to travel. Let me get hold of the photographer who coaxed that picture from our Per! - Achoo! - Good luck... I mean, bless you! Well, you've got your movies back up on the wall. There have been more pictures, I think. - Yes, there he is as a clown. - Yes, you must say that. He is wonderful. One has to hope he doesn't read newspapers. Life must go on, even if the heart cries for blood. - Weep what? - Blood. Heart blood. Heart blood? Oh! What's up with that? Hello, up there. It's dad. He must not see that I have cried. Now we have to agree! Anders, have you seen the newspaper? I didn't believe it yesterday, but today it says pictures and everything. - I have bought five, one for each of us. come. - Yes, I'm invited to come after all. - Look, here are the newspapers, children. - Thank you Father. You can believe that I was the man of the day at the office! After all, it said "the chief cashier of the well-known company" and so on. Can you go out and get the sherry and two glasses? When should we travel? On Wednesday at 15.30 on Crown Prince Olav. It is powerful. What's under my picture? "Per: A man of the world in pocket size." Why not: "A little boy with an elephant?" It's journalism. They decorate it. Do they also decorate Sis? "Sis, the youngest of the family: A lovely little thick sack." God, yes, I remember when that picture was taken. I think Sis would appreciate a more recent picture. Yes, she was inside the dairy, and there they laughed when they saw her. - Did they? - Here she comes! Away with the newspapers! Sit on them! - Good evening, father, when do you want to eat? - There is no rush. Sit down. I'm looking forward to that trip. The bright young press photographer is coming along. - Is he coming? - I feel good about him. - Yes, he is healthy. - Ole, come on. You can try liking that man! He has bothered Sis! What does he have? All right! He shouldn't find it funny. (the phone is ringing) Now I have to! Hello? Yes, then I'll call dad. Take a chair and sit down. Hello? Yes, good day again, Mr. Editor-in-Chief. Ski gear? Nah, we don't have that. - Now it's all over! - What's over? It was exceedingly gracious. Thank you very much. Goodbye. One of the city's big magazines presents us with all our ski equipment. - I want a sleigh! - You must get that too. - Look, dad, isn't it nice? - Yes, that's it, my boy. Yes, it suits you! - Look, Per, isn't it much better? - No, take that girl's sleigh. - What do you say? - Ouch! If you weren't my sister, I would think you were a very beautiful girl. - Was it something? - Yes! You great Chinese! How are we going to make room for all that? Most travel in the sports clothes. Ah yes, it was nice. We only have three suitcases. Would you like to get your elephant out of my trunk! - Well, now you have to listen... - Shut up, Per! You mustn't put the elephant in dad's trunk! - Well, now you have to listen... - Shut up! What is it, Per? Would you be so kind as to move your elephant? - Well, little Sis... - Shut up! What have you taught me to speak for, when I must not say anything? - Well, child, now we have to go. - If only we don't have trouble with Per. He definitely wants the elephant with him. It's a dead-sick idea. I'll fix that. - Per, could you do dad a favor? - It depends on what it is. I'm a little worried about leaving the house empty. Don't you think you could get Bodil Kjaer to stay at home? Shouldn't she go to Norway? If thieves come while we are away, - - then they will be terrified if there is an elephant in the entrance hall. Yes! Then they run! - Dad, the car is out there. - Then we have to hurry, children. - Have you remembered to close and switch off? - Yes, father! The iron! (the doorbell rings) Good day. Would you like to take our suitcases? If some thieves come, you just beat them. Come on, sweetie. Sis! Hello! Good day, Mrs. Sejersen, it was very nice of you to come down and follow. - Shame on me. No, I'm coming. - With? I said to myself: "Agnes, you have so often wanted to travel to Norway. You have time, you have the means, you can do it!" - Are you also going to live at dr. Holm's hotel? - Yes, we'll probably have fun. Surely. You stand there and drag on your skis! However, go with them to the luggage. I'll probably take care of the children and all. Let's go! - Ugh, who could stay at home... - Nonsense! You're crazy about skiing. But not with four kids running around between ones legs. Of which the one on top of the it is only a baby. Babysitter! You should probably give it bottle. It's going to be terrible, I've never had one on my lap before. It would be good if you got away a bit. Because of Jeanette, you mean? It's over, you old man. - There will probably be a new one. - I'm done with women! They are too difficult. Sis, our suitcases hasn't arrived yet. So wait here a moment. You must apologize for that! It was terrible though! Yes, I can feel that. Now you have to see. You hold them like this here, vertically. Straight vertical. So you are not a danger to your surroundings. Sorry. Driver, we're in here. - Yes, thank you, that's good. - Whoa! Your device. If you find time for it. Happy trip! The two of us will sleep here. You have to lie down there and I lie here. I don't mind hitting you in the head when you fall down! I dont do that. I wanted to ask if you have any sea sick tablets. Yes, thank you, we have. Besides, there isn't a wind that stirs. Anyway, I'm going in and going to bed now. - It's probably a nice ship! - We have to go up and see when it sails. I want to join! It is a great experience for me. Well, there we have Mie and Ole. How beautiful the city looks from here! - We'll see if we can get a picture taken. - Where is Per? He was here just before. Per! Per! - Here I am! - It was good. I think we can get something out of this lifeline. Let's see. Whoa, where's little sister? Can't you carry her up here? I don't think that will be necessary. Yes, I want everyone in the picture! - There she comes. - What? This is my daughter Sis. Say hello to our bright young press photographer. They're grown up, huh? Now I can take a picture. If you want, it would be nice to stand up there next to your father. And you two holds it here. Like that! And then we all smile! Now I'm going to teach you a little trick that the Americans always use: You should say "cheese." - It's English and means cheese! - Yes, exactly. Then you show your teeth. Then we try it. One, two, three... Cheese! Exactly, excellent. I'm going back a bit... There it is... It is excellent, magnificent! Hold it! Moment! Do you want to move a bit? Well, what shall I have, children? - If us you mean, I would like a Pampus. - Me too. Fine. And Little Per? I would also like a Pampus if you can afford it. I can handle that. Waitor! Three Pampus. Does your daughter want no coffee? She goes out on the deck and looks at the stars. Maybe she's interested in astronomy? Nah, she's had a little heartbreak. Here you go and take sugar. No thanks, I don't know anything worse than sugar in coffee. I know something that tastes much worse. - Thick milk! - Nonsense, it tastes good! - No, it doesn't! - Well, that's it! Children must be seen, but not heard. Don't you think so too? I don't know, the child must still be heard. Are you there my sweet girl? We just sat and discussed children education. - Well? How many kids do they have? - Shame I don't have any children. How can you express yourself on that question? I have friends who are married and have children. And do you know everything about it? Nah, but a good old fashioned slap never hurts. - Did you yourself get itchy as a child? - Plenty! You see, Mie, it hasn't helped one bit. You are right. Listen here, you must be nice! My own fault. Nice coffee. - What's the matter with him? - He can't already be motion sick? - So, baby, are you feeling better now? - I would like some water. Here you go, Little Per, drink slowly. I would also like to ask for a candy. - Here you go. - No, two. Oh. Here you go. Don't you want to tuck those rugs in? There is so far to the foothill. - Is there more you want? - Yes, thank you, then I would like to have peace. How it is pretty here in Norway? Why don't you look at the lovely view? That's exactly what I'm doing. - Do you want the last Danish? - I would much rather have the bag. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Ahhh! What was it? - It was a good bum! - Now we are there, now we are there! - That was great! - Shall we get off? - Yes, baby. Here are your mittens. Do we now have it all? Now watch out, children. - I'll take care of the luggage. - I will come along. Has anyone seen my hat box? How cold it is here! - Where is Per? - Haven't you seen Per, children? - We haven't forgotten him in the compartment, have we? - Stop the train! - We have to stop the train! - We forgot Per! - So, so, calm down. - We have to find Per! Per! Oh, no. There is nothing to weep about! - What should we do? - We have to phone the next station. So, then, go up to the hotel with your sister. - We would much rather stay here. - We must stick together. We must be calm. It's not at all certain that something happened, is it? - I run in and make a phone call. - Say they have to search the whole train. Yes. Yes. Aah, the little one.... There he is! - We thought you were on the train! - Where have you been? - In there. For men. - How could it occur to you? When you have to, you have to. And I had to! Aah, thank God, children. Come, we'll go up to the hotel. - Ih, how nice it is here! - Yes, for the hell of it! What is that? He has beard above and skates below. Well, him? It's a Scotsman. Now we have to go up to our rooms. Now watch the stairs, child. Ms. Sis? I just need to talk to you. Come. Now you must try to take it easy. Don't break up, right? There is no reason to immediately believe the worst. So I have spoken to the nearest station. He wasn't on the train. Who? Who? The boy! Per! Well, we have found him. He goes there. - Where have you been for so long? - Aah, your... uhh! These are our suitcases and these are my skis. - Do you want to taste them right away? - I might want to. Thanks. You can just as well jump into it as jump into it. Are you already going out to try the boards? Yes, I have only tried at home in the garden. Be careful not to break your legs. Go inside with you. I don't want you standing there laughing at me. It could never occur to me. Help! I'm falling! It never works! I must have a kiss for that, my girl. - Will you let it go? - It is difficult, because you are so sweet! - We are absolutely not douches! - Yes, that's exactly what we are. Is that you, Peter? What are you doing here? See that cabin up there? I live there with a couple of student friends. We have made a small amateur orchestra and have got a job down at the hotel. - Did you know we were coming? - The whole hotel knows it. We wade in Danes down there. And newspapers. With pictures. There was one in particular that I noticed. Of you. So? - Was that lamb skin you were wearing? - Aah, you must always tease! Think, suddenly I'm so hungry. You also have to hurry if you have to change for dinner. I can do it best myself. If only here were not so smooth. And it didn't go downhill! - It's quite an experience for me. - To dance with me? I meant more the hotel and the food. The food? Yeah, I can't deal with that. You know what I mean. It always tastes much better when you haven't made it yourself. However, it is incredible that you can eat cakes on top of the big dinner! I really couldn't. You don't have to grow either, do you? - He is handsome, the young journalist. - He is only a press photographer. That's why he can be handsome. Sis won't last long! - Sis will go to a monastery. - Yes, and you have to go to bed. Oh no, Dad, you promised we'd dance the math teacher's polka. It is true. So it must be now. Go and find yourself a little lady. Remember to bow. - My name is per. - My name is Lillemor. - Will you dance with me? - Yes, please. - Shall we ask for a math teacher's polka? - What do you say? A calculus teacher polka! A really long one! Otherwise, we'll go to bed. - Shall we two dance? - No. - Shall we? - Oh, no... Yes! Come on! Look here for a moment. I just want to take a picture of you. Cheese! - Do you go over to the practice hill? - Aren't you coming? No, you can handle yourselves. We go for a walk up the mountain. Shame. That she wants! First a school teacher, and now a press photographer! She has a strange taste. Couldn't she take one that was a little practical? Yes, an ice cream man! Now I'd rather see her married to a chocolate business. No, one with a cinema. Then she was of little use. In any case, we should not have him Soeren in our family. No, he won't stand a chance! Well, on with the glove. Yes, mine is on. Are you there? Morning! Have my children gone out in the snow? - Will you put your hat on? - No, it looks so stupid. Apparently it doesn't work. It's freezing fourteen degrees outside. I'm going to look like grandma in Red Riding Hood. Yes, then you must take the cap on top. - Shame they won't starve. - Shall we bring food? Yes, we are going on a long trip. Shall we go skiing? - Do you think it will work? - Ork, yes! Up, it's nothing. And down, it goes by itself! - Aah, you didn't beat yourself up, did you? - My foot. Please wait. Porters! They must come and help. Be careful! You never know what might have happened. Is there anything I can help with? My name is dr. Madsen. - It's the right foot. - I'll have to look at that. You have to see, it's probably broken. Why look at it so blackly? It might just be sprained. Then we go up the hill here and use the poles well. Oops! Aren't you coming, Little Per? Try to get up, Per! So hurry up, man! It is so funny! Who says that? It was a hell of a lot of fun though! E.g! Don't you want to go skiing? No! I don't care much about that. - Where are you going? - Go out and see Norway. Now don't go too far! hello to you and hello to me hello for the country of Norway all that snow I before has seen is the pure water what is that shining white high on the top of the mountain if it's vanilla ice cream, I'll go for it well, never mind I love snow and the snow love so much, you can see hello to the sun and hello to the forest hello for crash bath hi for all that is fun ih where am I happy I make friends with anyone I meet on my way when they hear this one, they sing along hey for you and hey for me, hey for this and that the sun we always saw both day and night hello to the king in his castle he wears a crown I just bought mine, that's how it can go no sure one it's a pure one it must then freeze around its legs hello to trees and hello to bushes hello to every leaf magazines you can read in ih where am I happy it's like a fairy tale and I don't want to go home If you see any wild animals, you will be with them hey for you and hey for me, hey for the farmer's forest I walked straight to it end what a trip I'll have if I take a small kid, one for each forest If the farmer comes now, I will be embarrassed there is a cow don't stare. we are so mighty, good friends, the two of us hey for you and hey for me, now eat all your food have you had to cry because you have to be happy, bum! (the dog barks) Dear little Our Lord, won't you help me past the disgusting dog? Well, there's no need, it's tied. Well, little doggy! - It is clear for Copenhagen. - Thanks. Hello! Is it Anders? Yes, it is me. Yes, thanks, I'm fine. That is to say, I'm not feeling so well, I've sprained my foot. And Mrs. Sejersen is here. Sejersen! She threatens to take care of me. Yes, it was horrible though. Can you do that? Can you afford it? It was nice though. Yes, I'll wait for you. Threee minutes past. Goodye, Anders. Well, there you are. What happened? They look downright happy. We have sunshine, we have snow and we have holidays! Will you then come up to your room and keep your feet still! - Where is your daughter? - She's probably out having a bit of fun. So! It went very well getting up. - But what about coming down? - We try. So I don't dare to. Will you stay here until the snow melts? It will be sometime in May. However not. Come on, we stand and fall together. Follow me. Oops! Where are they going? Why are you asking me? Better ask the skis! Help me! Listen, stay down. It's a nice picture! I don't want to be laughed at again. All right. Come on up. There you go. Now I have to make the all-time skiing picture for you. Bend your knees... As the Norsemen says. So, keep the balance. Then we wince, and then we smile. - We? - Yes, we. That's a nice back cover, huh? Yes, this time he has been luckier. You look lovely. Hear, what do you want? - We just want to look. - Well, yes, here you go. Aren't we going to have that cocoa soon? Yes, but the guys there have to go for a walk. - Well, we won't! - Yes, you need fresh air. We? No! - Then get a couple of cups for yourselves. - We had thought that too. Listen Sis, you are very difficult to get hold of. There is something I would like to ask you about. - What's up with that press photographer? - nothing but common courtesy. Here you go, which is served. - What is it? Are you going anyway? - Yes, we were also young once. Huh! - No, it's Mie and Ole! - Yes, for the hell of it! - Shut up, Peter. - Can you see we could get up here? Yes, you did fine. Jump inside. Drop the jackets and stay a few days. - Lh, how cozy it is here! - And hot! Sis, we met Soeren. He asked for you. Didn't you say I went up here? We said you had gone over there on the other side of the forest. - You are getting too bad. - It serves him right! - Where is Little Per? - He is down on the hills. - Then I think I'd better go. - Why? I don't like him running around alone down there. - We'd like to stay a bit, right? - Yes, if l can be followed down with Peter. Yes, of course. - You're not worried, are you? - No. - Shouldn't I go with you? - No thanks, it's not necessary. - Thank you for a pleasant afternoon. - He is tobogganing down there by the forest. Bye. Bye. You, Peter? I want to ask you something. - Do you think I should be "boycotted"? - Boycotted? Why? I mean "boy haircuts." No, I like girls with long hair best. With curls that is. (song) Hi! Hello! I have to look for Per. Sis! Per! The train! Stop, Per! Watch out for the train! Per! Per! - And six out of seven. - I know that well. And the kid on the lady, and then there is nothing more to do. And ten on the knight. Well, you're cheating, dear! I know that. That can't bother a person. Now it went up! In that way. No, now I have to mix. And then you can lay one without cheating. - Aren't you going for a walk? - Me? No, dear. You can be quite calm, I'll stay with you. - Dad! Look who we're bringing! - It's Uncle Anders! Good day, Anders, and welcome. It was a surprise. You didn't expect that, huh? Good day, you old warrior. I heard you had a bit of a bad start. - Mrs. Sejersen is there. - Welcome to Norway. Children, will you see to it that my suitcases come up? I'm going down to get some postcards. I haven't managed to write a single one. I didn't mean to leave our poor friend. Finally buy a lot. Yes, thank you, I will. Bye for now. She is just about to kill me with all her care! Then you need a cognac. I have just been to a wine monopoly in Oslo. Well done! Then I get the dental glasses. Nah, listen, there's nothing wrong with your leg! It turned out okay in a day with lead water dressings. - Why do you have such a bandage on? - Because I enjoy it! Everyone is so helpful. Nothing with long trips up and down the mountains. - This is a holiday. It is rest. - You are a trick! Will you help me with the towel? Then I spin three or four times around myself... Now you have to see what I have for you. Never mind that it says "The Complete Works of Shakespeare." It's camouflage. First chapter... Second chapter! Good and healthy reading! - You are indeed right in that. Here you go. - Thank you. - Cheers, you old man! - Welcome to Norway. (there's a knock on the door) Sorry, I forgot... I bought a gargle box in Oslo. It should be so healthy for the throat. Well, aren't you going to spit out? Nah, ugh, it's such nonsense with that spitting. Yes, it is. I'll get my dental glass. I have been very irritated in my throat last few days. If only we had some cough syrup. She gets a cognac. She's smart, the old girl! - Do you think so? - Yes. Here I am! Be sure to take out the toothbrush. Ready to gargle? They may think it relieves. That was odd. I think it tastes like cognac. - I think you are right. - Yes, those Norwegians, they are sneaky! Are we going again? How nice it is that you have come up to us! Ho, ho, ho! - We're going up there, right? - Yes! - Uncle Anders, you're coming too, aren't you? - I do not think... - Yeah. Soeren must participate. - He must be welcome. Now come along, Uncle Anders. Nah. I have been allowed to borrow Dr. Madsen's skis. I'm kidding myself a bit. Just get out of here. Let's go. - Now don't break your legs! - I'll take care. Shakespeare... Aah, Shakespeare! Isn't there someone who will splash soon? - Can you see we could get up here? - Yes, you were right. I am always right. Look, it's Soeren! It went just fine! Five, four, three, two, one... Go! - What's your name? - Uncle Anders. - Are you Danish? - Pear Danish! What is that? Five, four, three, two, one, go! Should I go? Well, I'll go If you didn't know better, you'd think it was Uncle Anders! It's him! No, no, no! Howdy! Well done! - Stop, Anders, you're done! - I can't stop! Go away down there! (singing) - Why are you singing, little Sis? - Because I'm so happy. Come in. Think; Uncle Anders hasn't come home. You look nice! Should you wear it? - Yes, now I feel like it. - Soeren is just for him. - Yes, you are busy! - I think Peter is much nicer. Now I am ready. How silly you look! You look like an Easter lamb with curls. Mind your own business! Did you remember to clean your nails? - Yes. - And clean handkerchiefs? Stop it! I'm not a mannequin! Uncle Anders is coming! Thank God, Anders. I have been so anxious for you. - I have been halfway to Oslo. - What were you doing there? It was going downhill all the time. I had to follow along. Now I need a cognac. I put the book here. It is gone. Did you take it? No, definitely not. He has read it. Are you done? Nah, how it suits you. - I go in and help uncle Anders. - You do that. Come on, Soeren. Will you turn off? - Did you hear they were dus? - Yes and so what? You traitor! You must hurry. It rang a long time ago. I will admit I am starving. What shall we have for dinner? We're going to have soup with dumplings, and then we're going to have fillet of beef - - with onion and beans and tomato, and something white inside. And then we'll have fries, and the dessert, it's vanilla ice cream! How do you know that, though? - Yes, because the chef is my friend. - Well? And if you get hungry in the middle of the day, you can go downstairs and have a sugar snack. Sugar food? Maybe it was an idea. - Look where they dance, Per. - It's just like at home in the Kinder Garten. when two eyes shine like the warm spring sun then it has always been the shining symbol of love so I need no words and you can't hide your tracks I read your thoughts, they are like rose vines they are so full of spring sweetness you can see it in the redness of their cheeks I break all bars on the doors of the heart, I knock again I try but it is for no use for the door of your heart there is another name you are so sweet in all your great happiness, and share your misfortune after all because you think I know so little then your smile has told your secret I read your thoughts they are like rose vines flowers are blooming because you have fallen in love I just wished it was in me There will now be a slight interruption in the dance. The director will hand out the prizes to the winners of the slalom competition. First prize goes to Oeysten Lund, Norway. His time was forty seconds. The second prize goes to Denmark. Number two was Soeren Petersen with a time of forty-three seconds. Thank you very much. It was well done! The management has decided to award an extra prize. To a Dane who has shown a new and completely original form of slalom. - Come freely, uncle Anders! - Is it me? - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. It is way too much. It's a measuring glass! - May I see the fine cup? - Yes, go ahead. - It has cost 5.75. - Uh, but! Now it's probably bedtime. Can you wave goodnight? Good night! - Moin, moin! - Norwegians are strange people. They say morning when it's night. - Good night, little Sis. - Good night, little darling. Would you like to get me a banana? - No, you have eaten enough today. - Well, I would like a banana! Now you have to be sweet. Otherwise, I'll pick up dad. So sleep! Sis? If you pick up dad anyway, can't he bring a banana? Good night. Sis? Here I come! What was it? I will surely come after you! - This is a phone call to you from Copenhagen. - Thanks. That's probably from the editors. I would like to be allowed to see some postcards. Ah, sorry. Those are really cool pictures of Sis, anyway. She is a grateful victim... I wonder! All right, then I'll take some more pictures with the children. The father is a rather ordinary fat Mr. Middleman, - - who didn't invent the deep dish. He is so damn indifferent. Sis? Did you hear that? It's probably well done! So, Mie, don't say anything. I'd rather be alone. - We had to tell him our opinion! - No, we shouldn't talk about it. You don't have to say anything about this. I'm not coming down for dinner. Say, I have a headache. - You must have some food! - No. Good to go now, Mie. Go like that. You don't have to be sad, Sis. Hello, Sis! Where are you going at this time of day? Nowhere. I'm just mad in the head. Uh huh. On the whole world? Or on someone in particular? - The last. - What is it? You're upset. Do you need to chat a little? Then go up to the cabin. - Good evening, Mie. Where is Sis? - In her room. She has a headache. Is it for her? - Yes. She's not coming down for dinner. - Let me take it up to her. - Sis won't talk to anyone but me! - Well? Sorry. I HAVE GONE OUT TO FIND SIS Sis? Oh there you are. I got really nervous. So? Thanks for the trip, sweet Peter. What happened to her? I will leave that to you to find out. - Peter, come on. - I do not have time. - It is very important. - What's wrong? I have never said anything derogatory about your family. You said dad was a regular fat mr middle man. We do not belong to the intellectuals. Is there anything wrong with that? - Of course not. - Yes, you think so. You said he was very indifferent. Maybe he doesn't matter to you. But for the rest of us, he is the best and the sweetest little dad in the whole world. I think so too. He's just not worth anything as a material. Sis, you who are usually a sensible girl. Yes, and a grateful sacrifice! Aah, is that it? That's just the kind of jargon we have in the magazine. Someone who photographs well is a grateful victim. At least you said Dad didn't invent the deep dish. You big... Does he have it? I couldn't know that. - I do not like you. - I'm sorry. Sis? Mie is away. She has gone out to look for you. "I've gone out to find Sis." It hasn't been an hour since I spoke to her. - She knew I was upset. - I haven't said anything to father. Neither should you. We'll find her. That's horrible. And it's completely dark! (there's a knock on the door) - Do you know what we're having for dinner? - You don't have to tell us. - You don't have to be anxious. - We'll probably find her. I want to go. I think it would be fine if you take the dog sled. - Can you handle it? - Yes, we managed that once. - Now I am ready. - We get the dog sled. Hello! (cry) Mie! It was good you came! Did you beat yourself up? No, my ski is broken. I was so scared! Hello! She's here! Stay down there! We will come down to you. Come on, we're going home now, right? Now you sit like a little princess. It was a good thing we found you. - I think I'll go in to see Mie. - You mustn't do that, my dear. Dr. Madsen is taking her temperature. - What is he going to do with it? - Per! I just spoke with Dr. Madsen. Mie is doing great. I have spoken with Dr. Madsen. Mie is as fresh as a sea urchin. - I just spoke with Dr. Madsen. - We all have that. Oh? Then I want to talk to the magazine, and now Mie will be on the front page. "Little Danish girl disappears on the mountain in a terrible snowstorm." - It's material. - No, it is not. That's a lie! You will never be a journalist, Little Per. I hear you are not traveling with the rest of us today. I came several days later, so I want to enjoy the joys of mountain life. Sensible! And maybe Mrs. Sejersen will stay too? That's the beauty of it! She leaves today! Can't I go somewhere else and chat? Out with you, men! - Where are you going? - I'm also a man. - We have to go. Where is Soeren? - He went ahead. Peter hasn't come to say goodbye. - Uncle Anders is not in his room. - He is not at the hotel at all. - Now we have to go down to the station alone. - It's so strangely empty here. Now we must hurry, otherwise we will be late for the train. - It's disgusting, we have to leave! - And in such an uncelebratory way. (orchestra) It's Uncle Anders! Goodbye, Peter! - Goodbye, Anders. Take care now. - Thank you. Goodbye and get home well! - Did the train go? - Yes, you came too late, dear lady. It was terrible though. But it is a faithful one, You are here. Take my suitcase. It must be fate's will that I should stay. The two of us will probably have a good time together. - How long are you staying? - not for long! Aah, then you're home again. Don't you want to go in? - Yes, thank you, just a moment. - Ole, go over and open the door. That suitcase stays on the wagon. Oh no, we forgot to cancel the milk and morning bread. Lots of bags. It is so powerful! Then we have food in the house. Ih, how dark it is here. Oh, daddy's little elephant! You have neither eaten nor drunk while I was in Norway. - Go ahead and come inside. - Thank you very much. - I think it's stuffy in here. - Father, a telegram has arrived. "Is on the way home. Anders." Why, though? Can't you figure it out, dad? Well, yes! Then I must ask you to greet your editor-in-chief many times. You are welcome as often as you come by. Thank you very much. That was nice. Goodbye, kids. Farewell to you. May you be well. And behave properly. Sis? Are you leaving now? I'll call you tomorrow. May I? Of course you can. - Sis? - Yes? Well, no, it was nothing. - Goodbye, you. - See you later. See you later. Did you let him go? Soren, wait a minute! What's wrong? Mie and Lille Per and I have thought about it. Oh? I mean, we don't mind. - No. - It's perfectly fine. Now, don't get angry, all right, but what's the matter? - The thing with you and Sis. - We have nothing against it. No trace! I must thank you. I really appreciate that. But... It's not entirely certain that she wants me. It was actually a shame. I take good care of him. - Yes, he was healthy. - You had just gotten used to him. The ways of love are very strange. Yes, that's good. Last! hey for you and hey for and hey for every one we've been together but now it's over Dot! --- Subtitles Essery. ---
