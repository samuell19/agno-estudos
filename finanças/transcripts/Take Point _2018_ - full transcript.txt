There are North Korean leaders who are also known as King there immediately airs on your screen now, walk to position it was clear he was alone, unattended, go inside ... President of the United States come and here it is both people, let's watch the moment. Yes, that's the beginning. Where is the moment of peace the whole world watching. As they always are expect something to happen. But, it takes a long time to reach an agreement. North Korea will start full scale denaturization process. The UN approved the abolition North Korean and Chinese sanctions ... Chinese car manufacturers began importing oil North Korean iron on a large scale. The US economy has fallen, due to protection policies prolonged trade with China. China found a solution for the domestic market. Workers in Detroit will strike today, projected industrial market US cars will decline. Mass strikes spread to Wisconsin and Ohio .. What is certain is, removing the Korean trade ban The North has weakened the US market. Three provinces which are the battlefield biggest for next year's presidential election .. McGregor lost a third the province, he will lose. President McGregor seems turn things around. According to military insiders, The Pentagon gave very big prize for the North Korean Supreme Leader which is informally known as King. The prize set is not comparable with Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden. Why Because of North Korea at all not helping this election. Is the US fighting with Iraq because? Weapons of mass destruction Of course not. President McGregor's rating go down every day. The problem is still not disarm North Korea ... North Korea's nuclear program In short, if it's a weapon nuclear is in North Korea McGregor won't get a second chance. Okay, I've moved to the anti tapping channel. Our agent Mackenzie runs this operation through simulation and the president's rating will multiply if this works - and in just 4 hours. - 53 / to be exact. McGregor will win and I will be transferred back to Langley as part of the deal Okay, but this bothers me. I understand and for security reasons You made a contract with PMC instead use our own military. But looking at these archives, This mercenary comes from Latvia, Columbia, Mexico, even Sierra Leone. They are all illegal aliens. What I want to say is can you entrust such operations important to these money-hungry criminals - What if something goes wrong - That is precisely why. If something goes wrong, it will be easy to sever ties with illegal foreigners. I'm sure these people did not make a mistake. Why can you be so sure Ahab, he is the captain of the Raptor 16 and at the CIA we all like it. He never disappoints we in the last 6 years. He always completes the right job time, never leave chaos. And of course days this is no exception. Wait ahab What is his real name? That's the password, he got it in the Korean Special Forces. After a parachute accident. - Parachute accident What happened - a minute. Mr. Secretary, target arrived, I have to go. And you have to make it his victory speech. So what are you doing Here's the question, what what you will do Well, what will my answer be affect my evaluation, captain Hey, intern. This is the highlight of the test. So, think carefully before you answer it. My name is not an apprentice, Logan Smith, I'm from Illinois. Illinois He is a comedian. Yes, hacking the surveillance camera and catching police officers beating up civilians. Upload the recording to Youtube and CrimeSelf for Japanese youth. The next American clown is still more better than illegal citizens, right, captain With this stupid president being US citizens like before. You're an illegal citizen, captain I think you're American. Of course. Pay attention to friends, the target enters the tunnel. I want this to be finished in 10 minutes. Understand. Answer this question, there is a chance of 100 / you can live if you leave a teammate. But if you help team, you won't survive. Hey, intern. Think carefully I will survive, just like you, captain. God damn it! You know, you just arrived kill yourself, right Then I learn from you captain, find out the way we can get out alive from this operation Tell this operation briefly. Um, right at 6 p.m., Young Tack Lee, minister of armed forces of the Korean people North will attend secret talks with the ROK CFC commander. Our team of Raptor 16 will kidnap and take it safely from the target as the first objective. And the mission must be finished ... Say, your teammate is headed target or foil mission. Who do you secure first According to the target protocol is our top priority, sir. So, you will leave your teammate to die No, no, sir. I ... I have to find a way. What if you get shot Will you still save him Want to go back to Illinois, an intern. You can say you will save someone, but when you were shot pierce your stomach. You will only think of yourself. You saved that person, right Today I have urinate 30 times. - This is prostate cancer. - Prostate right, baby. Did I tell you if my wife is pregnant Only have a little time to urinate. The closer they are to giving birth, the more nervous I am. When will she give birth After this operation is complete, I will go to the airport. Heading to the hospital in Philly. He will be induced. So tomorrow, I will be a father. Say hello to little Ahab. Don't talk about it, effeminate base. [SHORTING] Logan, how is the development No external circuit connected from one channel that the CIA entered, but I can access the outlet if there is a circuit breakdown and entering the satellite. - But the connection will be limited. - Wait. How long Usually communication satellites takes 40 minutes, I might be able to connect go there for 3 minutes. - Once we pass this ... - Raptor 16, enter. This is station 10. Oh no, Mac. Where have you been We are looking for you everywhere. - Is something wrong - First, we want to thank you for that took us to this beautiful suite. We are only laborers, we will never be able to go upstairs, a place like this. Without your help. But can I ask something Have you verified the convoy One, why is a place like that this is no ESPN channel Ahab, verify the convoy. And two, eliminate authorization for meeting that took place in South Park. One hour ago your team changed its place to this underground DMDA bunker. Like I said, we like this place, but why is the signal bad, and there is no help. What is wrong Well. The bunker is part of a series of tunnels which was dug up by North Korea during the cold war. The tunnel was designed to attack South Korea. But once found, we will supervise for 24 hours. The entire area has been renovated to be a meeting place. For secret talks between the two countries. How much is the cost for this installation For security reasons, all places are included the VIP suite that you really admire ... get communication restrictions. Call the number, when you got a signal. If you don't do it before the operation starts, you come out. You mean what happened in Vegas still in Vegas. This is the ideal place for surgery, now show me that place. Why do you keep talking about it Ahab, show me that place. - Gerald. - Raptor 16, The only corner we have. Confirm negative ID, need a better angle. Mom, you saw the convoy come, who else is it Find a better angle. I started thinking, you don't trust us. You're always right on target. But I'm already in Korea for the past 6 years, finish the operation and I won't damage it for something I believe in. According to professionalism, you can help me You mean, what are you giving know we changed location You have 5 minutes. Gerald, try and search all the corners, please This is our last job, so I think we will be fine. Is it true We must hurry up Well, if McGregor failed to be elected back, his men will be angry and build walls and shoot bad people. What makes it difficult Is that for us, isn't it? Don't democrats consider it illegal Gosh. You smell so bad today. When was the last time you wash your buttocks You better get used to the buttocks this, or your nose moves to the buttocks. Hey, you two. Shut up Captain, if the opposition takes control what we don't need worrying about health insurance. Children can't go to school anymore, right We also don't want to talk this blank too, right Wake up and see the side good, friends. You think politicians care about what people don't like People who can't choose This is bullshit. No one will help us, cheer up out there. We are alone. You know, I hope we can win. We cannot choose, we are there here just to get money. I can still choose. Hey, captain. I have a friend at the embassy. I see the worst will Come on, you might be right. Why Because of the president On the Superbowl day. A homeless woman and her child shot in front of a supermarket in my hometown. They ask for help on the sidewalk, no one is paying attention. That's not just one or two mistakes people, it's everyone's fault, you know Fuck that. Why are you here Be the supermarket security. It used to be my job. Until what I realize the reward is as a child. Alright, say the world, get bad luck with all this. What is the connection with the current war Nobody will stop it. People don't care unless it's direct affect, so if that continues This will all take place until it finally exploded. Hey, captain. Before we take action today, are you gonna do the thing same with the parachutist A little more war complicated than that, kid. But if war breaks out remember one thing. When you are on a mission, the most important principle to follow is ... Captain! There is something. What is this Station 10 this is Raptor 16, missiles seen in the south, possibly lookout, visual confirmation. I repeat, the missile is visible in the south, visual confirmation. Raptor 16, visually confirmed. North Korean scouts, intercepted by a transfer missile. Gosh. And there are traps too. This is crazy. - Okay, start evacuating. - Negative. Continue as planned. Mac, we are in military democracy and I found this from North Korea. We will do this soon, and you ... All patriots from 3 models have the target level is less than 10 / this one will touch market in the second trial ... You know reconnaissance missiles will be launched Yes, because we launched it. General Lee knows us will come for him. We tell him that we will help him defect on condition he must shoot reconnaissance missiles to Seoul. That gives us reason. Reason for what Manipulate disarmament North Korean weapons. Seriously. Seven US fleets anchored in the eastern sea. US FJ and all US troops in Korea are getting ready. After the General gives we coordinate to the north, our disarmament only will take a few minutes. And the Korean government North will end tomorrow. LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, ALIAS KING MAKES THE LAST EFFORTS And the White House agreed it's like today Because today is like today. A North Korean missile destroyed around Seoul, even though the missile was confirmed not equipped with a nuclear warhead. The attack was clearly concurrent with today's presidential election. The missile is believed to be a reconnaissance and missile flew as far as 121 miles from the launch site. This is not a military operation, this is an election campaign. We don't think McGregor is will never be re-elected but if the news is about disarmament North Korean weapons air just before the poll starts, he will be re-elected. Raptor 16, I got it other point of view. Be prepared for accept visual. Your security still guaranteed 100 / but ... let's be honest here, you want this war to break. That's how you make a living, so nothing has changed. Nothing has changed You get another 4 years and you got a promotion What we got What is the point, Ahab This is an important situation, right We are not paid worth the work. We have to be paid more. So you're just looking own advantage. You don't care about us. This is no time for ask for more money. You're trying to save a few dollars by hiding something from us Your company has sign the contract. I can't do anything. You have one minute. Well, you should find a solution. Because I will not continue without the right pay. You have one minute, Mac. Raptor 16, there is a situation. Possible jackpot, me repeat, possible jackpot. KING HIGHEST LEADER OF NORTH KOREA What is he doing there Mac, you see what I see That's King. I am sure of it. He brought his medical staff with him. Langley's phone, search know what happened. Logan, turn off the volume. What King is included in this operation No, something went wrong. Please hurry up, captain. Well. All units are on standby further instructions. Mac, we have a chance to catch the most wanted man in East Asia. What do you mean you want to catch King Are you just going to skip this just like that We have not received a report intel, which explains why he ... What if King wants to come instead of General If the General's intention is to defect, then King must have pursued the same thing. But then why is he bring medical staff You know, recently she has heart disease, of course he needs a doctor. King shows no signs want to give up for the past 6 months. Captain, what happened You wait. Wait. Make a way out again. I mean, think of it from the side. He knows North Korea is the ship is sinking, but instead of drowning with him ... he wants to improve the end of his work. Gerald, give the number of guards in that place and route. - Are you serious, captain - Right now! Even if you're right, Building White will not allow this. If we let King defect, President's rating will drop. He can't be re-elected. If he accepts King's defection, isn't he only King will simulate the North. The two opposition will choose anti-war. Re-election has no brain. Then you will get a big prize. If you catch the General you get a small prize. If you catch King, you will become a person in power. This is the best solution. I know you Mac, you can't leave something like this. - Can you make it happen - Raptor 16, there are 12 people in that place. - How many - 12, they are armed. Happy holiday. Ahab, I need confirmation if you can catch it I will ask for reinforcements. Captain, if we will this, we need reinforcements. Gerald's Standby, I'm on my way. Mac, I'll catch him alone. I want to clarify one thing, officially this is an action invalid which means Raptor 16, deviate from the original operation. The government of the United States will not responsible for damage or failure. Do you understand Okay, we don't have many choices. We will solve it in a few seconds. Don't continue until I gave you a green light. Logan stop your job and use your skills. [ So how the story ends The captain saves them, not You don't need that. Maybe we'll be back soon. With the fall of the rating, what this is McGregor's last chance That also means how McGregor responded to the situation. We will get a big effect in the upcoming election. Listen, everybody. Our goals have been revised. We are chasing King. I need someone to lead. You know, what do you think is a delay Warning. 12th floor has closed. Please leave the building blank. When will this nonsense run smoothly No, who leads Confirm the number of people, locations and weapons. All entry access. The number of victims is very high. Someone will receive a reply. This group will be divided based on everyone's seniority. If we get help, it is divided respectively. So, everyone agrees Nice. Who leads Then what are the results, friends Who will advance I'm just with my feet Captain, there are 80 / chances are we will lose. Now it's a bad time. We don't want to make a wrong decision. Hosea, you are ready If we break through some people will die. We need more people. I know... But with your troops, we can do this. I am because we can't die Hosea. We are all on the same ship. Do you know why I'm bothered suck just to pick you up Because I want to get out, just like you. If you go back to town as long as you are empty handed, You won't be more of a problem anymore. But if you do this, if we get it. There will be no more blood in your hands. There are no more nonsense and military missions. You can have a farm you always want, ordinary life. Together with your family every night. This is a beautiful ending. If I die, my family alone and they will be tortured. Hosea ... Show me. When the President of America The union gives us orders, we have to do it somehow. You're the fastest of us all. You will be fired. But if someone else does it and advances, can you live like that Just believe me. Paralyzed two enemies and close the room. We will return to 100 / Captain... Can I really go home after this Of course, friend. Thanks. Okay, Hosea will lead. We protect him. Drop the target quickly. Confirm the target. King is a priority. Nothing is kept secret, just a corpse and remember ... they are not enemies. Right - Yes, here it is. - Better fast. You have 3 minutes from every call is 40 minutes. Is it fair enough Not now, damn it. Yes, what's up I'm working. Please, hurry up. Oh, I think something happened to you. Raptor 16, mission status has been revised. Wait. Station 10, we will move in. Negative, the operation will be submitted to the reserve team when they arrived. The time is 5 minutes. They will arrest King. Wait Wait, Meg. Where are they Too many enemies. The reserve team will take orders. I understand, it looks like it took 5 minutes. We won't get a chance again. Sorry, but we play it safe. That was the final decision. Safe Let me see everything. Do you want the big dog to come and release this from me We have strength, we have to break through now. Captain! Open this door! What are they doing here - No, they are not allowed to be here. - Don't let them enter This is my operation. Stop them! Don't let them in! Ahab! You said you could do it, no Go, now! This is an emergency situation. I have to do this. You're always like that. What is wrong with you - Are you angry - What do you expect You always deny your promise. I can't accept it more than this. You hear Captain! The dogs have sniffed us! Ahab, what are you waiting for! - Get away! - Captain now or not at all! Sorry. I have to go. I will redeem this for you. This is a dead life situation. Please understand. Hello... Shit. - Charles, come on! - Come on ...! Fast! Team Bravo, go forward ...! Someone got shot - No, captain. - Good, captain. Everything is OK. - This is new. - No need. Too much lasagna. Do your job, everyone. Let's take care of everything. Everything was messed up by some mercenaries. Hosea. Good work. I told you. You will be fine, no thanks. I do it well, captain. Captain! King is ready. Station 10. Targets are obtained. Please confirm. Confirmed vital sign will be sent now. Pulse and blood pressure are stable. An official statement will be released soon. Evacuate immediately, replace. "Important White House Announcement" Where is the rest Only King comes. I understand. Hey, are you sure, kid You might just see their faces in your nightmare Let's finish this and go home. I told you to confirm your goal! Captain, he lost blood fast! Captain, he bled quickly! He was shot in the neck. Son of a bitch. Meg, tell the medical officer to immediately send help, okay - We need it soon. - I said evacuate. They will announce it shortly. You said they could come here in 5 minutes! - You can... - Don't do this to me, Ahab. You want to wait and divide the money with the reserve team Stop playing around and go to the extraction point. You will be fine ... Oh, shit! He will not be safe. We must leave now. Shut up! Captain, I know you will do this. Do you believe that this is the best way But, we must save him. Shit! OK... Everyone moves. Logan, there are no medical staff to today. Help him bring the King. - Captain! - We can still save him, if we ask the medical team. Go! What are you looking at Moving ...! Why no one helps Are we a team! No, captain. Captain, he is still bleeding! If you ask the medical team, we can take it out of here alive! Captain! If you ask the medical team, we can get it out of here! Stop it! Dark operations like us. We do not have insurance, not like you. If we take it out of here, he will die on the hospital steps. And when they found out, he was illegal. They will pursue us and even our families. You have to face reality! You will help him, by leaving it here. Let's move! You don't know what to do What, hah, what kind of captain are you. Wait. Hey, let me tell you something, The original captain can't come because he's not too sure ... Shut up. They will know who you really are. - So - Just shoot it. Show them your true nature. How can you know me? I know more than you. You're just a chess piece. You have been used from the beginning. You are stupid. Captain! Our position is leaking! And there is shocking news from Korea. Emergency report from North Korea TV station. The mercenaries are hired by The CIA has killed the North Korean leader, which was also known as King 10 hours ago. Reports say mercenaries arrested by North Korean soldiers. Shit! You sacrificed. They make you bait. Bastard! If we stay here, we will will end up like them. We have to do something! Captain, we have enough C4 to destroy enemy lines. Okay ... Charles, you go forward. Come on! It remains unclear whether the CIA is responsible responsible for this covert operation. However, North Korea has prepare their warships. According to North Korea, this is the reason they attacked us today ... and this is only the beginning of their retaliation. One hour, again the bodies of the rebels this plus King will be displayed ... as evidence of a rebellion against North Korea. Hey, duck! [SHOT] There are enemies coming in! That's not good. Their numbers exceed us! I repeat, North Korea has stated that they planned a nuclear attack. President McGregor still haven't made a statement ... Marcus ...! Move! If they enter, shoot just and then get out of here. Shoot! Move! Duck down! Did you destroy it Bullet! Shoot! JP, crouched down. We will get you out. Not yet. Not... - Meg. - No, raptor 16. Take out the King first. - What about my team - Help is on the way. Meg, we are pressed here. We need help now. King first. Come on! JP got shot! Here! Shoot! Captain, we have to go! Captain, you have to go! If the King dies, there will be no help! - Come here. - You just go. Bring King. Now! Prepare C4 ...! Help is on the way. Don't go far, we will do this quickly and don't die! Come on ...! Come on ... Meg, who are they They are from a company with heavy weaponry. They are here at full strength! Mercenary Company called First Service. Unofficial and recognized by China ... who recently bought them. Move...! So China is trying to attack North Korea first China uses King as bait, which means they have mastered the north. The problem now is the cause. North Korea said that they will fire nuclear. But, China has control for their weapons. So they will fire nuclear under the guise of Korea and ... the country that shot down the missile was China. Because they launched it. Yes. North Korea fired nuclear weapons because of American mistakes. And China prevented him, being a hero, wearing it as an excuse to rule North Korea. And the only way to preventing them from being King. Captain, C4 is in position. Explosion. - Move! - Move! Okay, leave the team on help and go to the extraction point. Sorry, all of this is my fault. That is not your fault. Leave everything and take the tracker now. Tracker... "North Korea declares a nuclear attack." Raptor 16. What just happened - Turn it off. - What really happened What happened Turn off the radio. Raptor 16 Reports, what is your status. Raptor 16! Ahab! Oh, shit. That one too. Come on I think I'll experience heart attack, you know Waw, it's tense. This is our location. This is a B-21 bomber. They have waited 2 hours. Do you understand Why do you think women it sent us here Why doesn't he send the military He never wanted the general. He only wants coordinates us and then the bomb! All evidence exploded into smoke. Even if we bring King, you think he will let us live No, he will kill us, because we know everything. Where did you get the intel? They contacted me a few days ago. There is a big prize for King. We can share it 50:50. Yes. You mean the same person out there Oh, that's what I asked a few years then when you offered me this job. Let's make this short, fine Right yes Well. OK, good. This company offers us two salaries fold, allowances, also citizenship. Now after this attack end, we bring King to them. And then clean our names. Da this person will open his mouth because he was tortured. And we will get the source of their money. If I disappear so just what about my wife When you get out of here, just call him. You told him to go to the airport. I mean, fuck it. You set it yourself. After all, it's too dangerous to raise children there. No, it's impossible. Will he catch a plane today, everything is fine. He is in danger now. Marcus, this is really crazy. If we just leave ... how good it is. What You will say if we ... we go then they will all die Today, you are not you. This is everyone responsible for themselves. That's what you say. Earlier, you said that, no Now, please listen to me. Do you come with me Or you don't join Marcus, sit with me and we discuss it. Well. Of course, a good alert offer. But what if they are just take it and kill us As far as I look. It's easy for them to get rid of us rather than keeping any conditions. Yes, yes The money is always good. - But you have to think about ... - This is safe. There are other members There is no other team. [SHOT] Hell of it! We are mercenaries, we work for money.
