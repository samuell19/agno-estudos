Subtitles by explosiveskull In just 24 hours, more than a quarter of a million people have fled the terror of Rwanda. - We're never going to make it. - We will. Two thousand are dying each da. More than one death every minute. This is the bloodiest civil war in 20 years. Why are they doing this? Stay calm, we'll be okay. The Rwandan killing fields are a bloodbath of humanity. - Get out of here! - Everybody, get out! The death toll has risen to half a million deaths. Terrified Rwandans are fleeing in every direction. Get down! The madness and horror is beyond comprehension. - Come! Get out! Get out. - No! No man knows how or when his test will come nor how far he will go to protect those he loves. For me, my story begins in Rwanda, before the times of trouble. It is the place of my birth. The home of my family, and the country that I love. I am William Mwizerwa. I am a son, a husband and a father. I am also a supervisor at Rwandan National Coffee Company, working like any other father to provide for his family. But I had no way of knowing the length to which I would be tested to protect my family. Yet my story is not so different from others who endure hardships or suffer pain. We all have our own journey, facing moments of decision that echo throughout our years. And my story would not be complete without sharing the stories of two other families who each faced their own struggles. Fathers, fighting to protect their families in ways they could never have imagined. And their lives flow into mine like the rivers move through Rwanda. They're every heartbeat etched into the stones of my path. William. Always last to leave. Augustine. Wish I could just walk across the compound to my home, like you. But if you lived here you would not stop working. That may be true. Daddy, Mommy has dinner ready. Give my best to Josephine. And mine to Ebraille and Aimee. Okay, so how was school today? - Fine. - What did you do? Hostilities began when forces struck President Habyarimana's plane with a surface to air rocket as it landed in Kigali. Unconfirmed early reports claimed all on board were killed, including Burundi's President Ntaryamira... With violence and civil unrest in the streets, citizens are urged to stay in their homes. I know last weekend was a holiday, but business doesn't stop 'cause he wants to go out of town. I need those numbers. I know he'll want overtime. Look, he's young and single. The violence in Rwanda continues... That's fine, that's fine. Just tell him to get it done. ...government has created a refugee situatio. What in the world? No, no, I'm not talking to you, I'm home. Look, I gotta go. I just heard about the president. His plan crashed. There's been gunfire. Yes, we need to stay in the house. We'll be safe. - Where's Aimee? - She's inside. Hey, everybody, I'm sorry I'm late. Hey. Hi, hi, hi. Hi, hi. Sorry, Dad. Sorry, honey. Hi, birthday girl. - Coming through. - Okay. Oh, my gosh. Honey, you have outdone yourself again. Aw. Good grief, sis, is it her birthday or her wedding? Are we gonna eat that or she's gonna ride it? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, not yet. Hang on. Everybody get your cameras ready. She's gonna be three by the time you light it. Hush, hush. Okay. Okay, ready sweetie? On three, okay? One, two, three. The reports maintain that Kigali streets have been overrun with conflics between government troops and the militia. - Augustine. - William. We are barricaded in the house. We hear gunfire everywhere. What's going on over there? We are fine here. You know, we have the guards, we have the walls. But our truck drivers, they have reported militia going door-to-door. Is there any way you can get back to the coffee compound? You'll be safe here. William? William? Are you there? William? It's Hans. Hans, thank goodness it's you. I had to come before we leave. Port relief decided to pull us out. What? Evacuating? - It is that bad? - I'm afraid so. Militia soldiers are going door-to-door. A man in your position will be in danger. You have to get your family out now. Aimee! I believe we can make it to the coffee compound. Good, you'll be safe there. But watch out for militia as you go. You've been a good neighbor and a great friend. I will miss you. God be with you. And you as well. Let's go. Don't forget this one, Pop. When is she gonna ever play with all this stuff? Oh, she won't. But I don't think that's the point. Our baby became a toddler today. I was so proud today... of her. Of us. Me too. This birthday has one more surprise. Baby, that's perfect. Oh. - We're never going to make it. - We will. What's going on up there? Get out! Get out, get down, come on! This is madness. Why are they doing this? - Stay calm. We'll be okay. - Look! Aimee, get down. Close your eyes. - Get out of here. - Stop! Everybody get out of the car! Get out! Come! Get out! Get out of the car! Aimee, get out of the car! Get down! Come! Get out, come! If you don't I will kill you. Come! Get out! - My dress! - Come, come on! No, my dress! Listen, you shut up and you be still! Down! - It's okay. - Shut up! Close your eyes, darling. Mugenzi. Come in for dinner. There were rumors at the market again today about the militia. The answer to my question is not in that bowl, Mugenzi. Keza, you know I have no choice but to join them. For a fight that isn't ours. The Tutsis that we know are like us, Hutus, good, hardworking people. And my husband is not a fighter. He's a farmer. You belong here with me and Umuhoza. You're right. I am not a fighter. But how can I protect you from their machetes unless I join them? In their minds, if we are not with them, we're against them. The cleansing has begun. It is time for you to take your place with your people. Mugenzi, please, no. - It is his duty. - His duty is being a father! Quiet, woman! Your husband belongs to us. Umuhoza needs you, Mugenzi. And I need you, please. War is breaking out, and you're hiding behind your woman and your little hut. Matisse... look what we found down by the river. Rats. - Pull them out of the shit. - On the ground! Stop. Put your weapons down. Put them down. We do not waste bullets on Tutsi cockroaches. No. Okay. I will go with you. Good! Let's go, little mouse! I love you. Stop! Stop! I can't keep running anymore. - We must keep moving. - What happened back there? Aimee? Aimee? Are you hurt? I lost my dress. We'll get you another one, even more beautiful. I'm never gonna see my 15th birthday, will I, Father? You must not say such things. God just delivered us with a miracle and He'll continue to be with us. Everything will be okay. All right? Can we make it on foot to the coffee compound? We can and we must. We'll follow the river to the compound. Augustine said it was safe there. Come on, let's go. Even Augustine and little Dorothy. I thought we'd all be safe here. If not for the roadblock, we would've been here. For this. We must go to Murambi. We'll be safe in my mother's house. After today, how do you know? All I know is we must trust God and stick to the river. Let's go. Keza, worrying will not bring him through that door any sooner. But why hasn't he come back? I'm sure he is fine. Fine. I hate that word. Nothing is fine. You know, they killed an entire family right outside my door. Sister, Mugenzi is a very good man. - He is not a killer. - I know this. But what if they turn him into one? Mother? Mother? Hey! - Who are you? - This is my mother's house. - Where is she? - Show me your ID card. Please, we only want peace. Show me your ID card now. I'm not a soldier. I'm just a father. Maybe just like you. Are you Hutu or Tutsi? We are all Rwandan. Hutu or Tutsi? No. No. Brother, if you must kill me, so be it. But please, let my family go. Father, I want to go! Aren't we all God's children? Go. Go now! Go, go, go, go now! Or I'll be forced to kill you! My friend, you'll never be forgotten. The lives you spared will not be wasted. What happened here? They ran in every direction, like cockroaches. Little mouse, you can't catch a woman and child? I went for the man, but he was too fast. You idiot! If you grab the child, the parents won't run! You are not a soldier. - I'm a farmer. - You are a fool! With the Rwandan death toll reaching nearly 800,000 people, many in the Tutsi minority seek asylum as refugees in the neighboring countries of Tanzania and Kenya. So, Andrea, you think you can go to the mall on Saturday? Yeah, right. Andrea, lead the horse. Don't let the horse lead you. See what I mean? She never lets me out of her sight. Okay, girls, let's go in. - Randy. - I know, I know. But you're gonna be glad I was late this time. Hi girls. - I have a surprise for you. - Is it a puppy? No. Is it a little sister? Definitely not. Come on, Daddy, what is it? Do the words Toby and Mac mean anything to you? Were going to Toby Mac concert! - I love Toby Mac! - Thank you, Daddy! This is amazing. I love Toby Mac. He's so awesome. For once, I don't mind you being late. Well, anything for my baby girl. Honey, she's not a baby anymore. Mother? I'm sorry, Aimee. Our money does not get us much in Kenya. How long must we stay? Until we have somewhere to return to. I've heard nothing good from Kigali, and I don't know what happened at Mother's. So until we have a safe place to go, we wait. I pray she made it out of the country. I look for her every day. ♪ Lift up your head now ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Lift up your head now ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Keep believing ♪ ♪ And lift your head ♪ ♪ It ain't over yet It ain't over yet ♪ Loving God is loving people. And one of the ways we can really love people is by giving to those who can't repay us. Under your seat you'll find the picture of a child. A child who can't pay you back, but someone you can directly impact with food, hope and the love of Jesus. Umuhoza. Can we do it? We would be helping her. I mean, that's what they say at church. "Helping those in need gives you back twice the love." - That is what they say. - Please, Daddy. - Okay, sweetie. Sure. - Yes! So take a minute, consider extending the hand of God's love to the world tonight. And hey, thanks for making us feel like family. Dear Umuhoza, I was so excited to get your letter yesterday. I did the usual. Riding, cheering and school. I'm sending a picture of me with the ribbon I won for horseback riding. Hope you like it. Come in. Hey, kiddo. Is your homework finished? Andrea, how many times do I have to tell you not to wear your dirty riding clothes on the bed? Your comforter smells like a horse. I just wanted to write to Umuhoza. You two must keep the postal service in business. Well, you'll never guess what she got. Stamps, I hope. No. A goat. A goat? Why on Earth would she want a pet goat? Mom, things are different in Africa. Everyone has a goat in Umuhoza's village. Really? Huh. Now wash up and come downstairs. It's just us girls tonight. Daddy has to work. Again? Yep. Come on, babe. Dear Andrea, your letter filled me with great joy today. I really liked the picture of you and the horse. Someday, I hope to ride a horse There are not many here in Africa. I can only write a little today I still have chores remaining. Dear Umuhoza, I'm so excited The cutest boy in school sat next to me at lunch. His name is Matt. He's the quarterback on the football team. I cheer for him the loudest. But I think my dad ruined my chances. He totally embarrassed me when he yelled at me - to get in the car. - Andrea, let's go! He always treats me like a little kid. - Sorry, I have to go. - It's okay. Dad. Dear Andrea, yesterday we received a letter from my father. He has been in prison since the war. The last time he saw me, I was just a baby. I hope when I finally meet him one day he will recognize me. You are so lucky just to have a father. Mama, why is Father in prison? Because he was with the militia. Why did he want to be with militia and not with us? Your father did not want to be with them. But it was the only way he could protect us from the danger of the evil men. You have to understand that. Will he ever come home? We must pray every day for his return. Did he love me? Of course he did. More than anything. There was a time we thought we could not have children. We were about to lose faith and... and God blessed us with you. So we must pray and believe that we will all be together again, okay? Mama, we will see him again. We will. Dear God, thank you for my best friend, Andrea and for all you've provided for me and my mother. We have so much. All I ask is for you to bring my father back home. Clear skies tonight... "And you should come to Rwanda and visit me." Daddy, Umuhoza wants me to come to Africa! Andrea! Apparently, your daughter wants to go globe-trotting on an Africa safari. - Africa? - It's not a safari. Umuhoza wants me to visit her. Can we go, Daddy, please? Sure, baby, we'll go someday. What am I supposed to say? It's dangerous over there? It's dangerous over there. Speaking of adventures, the girls want to go to the park for the Fourth of July fireworks on their own. I thought we were gonna watch the fireworks from the Anderson's backyard like we always do. Please, Dad? I mean, it's just up the street a little ways. Don't you wanna be together? - It's Independence Day. - And all my friends are going. I don't know. It'll be dark. Well, they don't do fireworks in the daylight. - A little help, please. - It's closer than Africa. And she'll be with Julia, and she's getting older. She needs to do some things on her own. It'll be crowded. I mean, what if you get lost? - Dad, seriously? - Honey, I'm okay with it. I am. As long as she sticks with her friends. - Promise? Okay. - Mm-hmm. Hey, guys, I gotta go to the bathroom. Okay. - Do you think he'd go for me? - I think so. - Really? - You better get a move on, sis, or you'll be stuck watching the fireworks back here. Andrea, meet us at the front when you're done. Shut up and be still. I love that part. Hey, sweet pea! How were the fireworks? Everything okay up there? Probably a disagreement with the girls. - I'll go check on her. - No, no, I'll do it. It's girl stuff. Andrea? Honey? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We're right downstairs if you need us, okay? Do we have all we need? I do not like leaving Aimee alone. Aimee is almost a grown woman. She can handle herself. True, she's becoming a wonderful woman. But it's just this place. Dangerous, violent. It's not the home I envisioned for our family. No, but we are alive. As long as our hearts are together, we are home. Aimee and I know you are trying to make it... William? Is that you? Hans! Ebraille. I don't believe my eyes. When I heard about the coffee plant, - I thought for sure you... - No, we did make it to the plant, but God spared our lives. Thank God. Aimee? Yes, she is here. But I have not been able to find my mother. Do you know of anyone from Murambi? I'm sorry, no. What about you? Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a need for a coffee man in Kenya. Quite the coffee expert, from what I recall. Maybe coffee is the answer. Because of your position at the company, the militia targeted you. And that could qualify you as refugee status. But we are already refugees. No, there's a special program. But not in Kenya, William, America. America? We could live in America? Only William would qualify. He would have to go first. But once the immigration process is complete, he could send for you and Aimee. - I could never leave my family. - I understand. But this may be your best way out of here. God, is this your plan for my family? To just leave them here, unprotected? Give me your wisdom, Lord. Show me the right path and give me the courage for each step. - It is a beautiful night. - Yes. Even in this horrible place, the stars are still wanderers. We'll be sharing the same stars with you in America. Ebraille, how can I leave you and Aimee behind? If you believe God orders our steps, who are we to say no when He opens a door? But we have no idea if this could even work or how long. Hans said this refugee status would provide better housing for us here, and a sponsor church for you in America. Aimee could have a real future there. We all could. There is nothing here to keep us. But I could only do it if I were certain that you and Aimee could be safe. Perhaps, it's God door for us. Be strong, okay? God's hand has brought us to this place. Who knows what wonderful things his plan has for us. I will count the days until I get to touch your face again. Go make a new life for us in America. I will send for you as soon as I'm able. My love, we'll be together soon. William, we have to go. Father! - Will you write to us? - Every day, my child. You are my heart. I love you. Dear family, I have arrived in America in a city called Nashville. Most of the people are very kind, but sometimes I long for home. So far, I have seen no machete, and that is good. Ebraille, God's provided a plae for me to stay as I build our new life in America. I pray for you every day and long for the day we are together again. So based on the numbers you gave me, we will be able to keep our heads above water for another year. We should be good through next year. That's great, Randy. Thank you for coming in. - Oh, pleasure, Pastor. - I appreciate it. So, how's the family? Darla's perfect. Andrea, she's turning into a typical teenager. - Going on 30, right? - Hmm. Don't worry, this, too, shall pass. If not, when was the last time you got a call for an exorcism? You'd be surprised. Can I help you? Oh, I was told to ask for Pastor Henry. Oh, you must be William Mwizerwa. - Yes. - I've been expecting you. - Welcome to Nashville. - Thank you. Say hi to Randy Hartley, head of the church finance committee. It's nice to meet you, William. William comes to us all the way from Rwanda. Rwanda? My family sponsors a little girl from Rwanda. Umuhoza. My daughter writes to her every day. Sometimes twice a day. They're quite the pen pals. In which city does Umuhoza live? Uh... It's... It's a little place called Maroon Beam - or, uh... Murbani? - Murambi? That's it, I think. You know it? Yes, yes, my mother lives close to Murambi. Oh, small world. I wonder if they know each other. Oh, unfortunately, I lost track of my mother and many that were close to me during the genocide. I'm sorry to hear that. A terrible tragedy. Yes it was. But I was able to escape with my wife and my daughter. Well, thank God for that. Yes. - Do you drink coffee? - On occasion. To our new friend from Rwanda. - Now, that's a cup of coffee. - Hmm. William, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure I'll see you around. Pleasure to meet you as well, Mr. Hartley. Call me Randy. - Pastor. - Randy. Phew. That is bad. Randy's great at finance, but not so great at coffee. All right, William, let's get you settled in. You're gonna love the parsonage. A little quant. Got a lot of personality. - Okay. - All right? Andrea? Could you turn that down, please? I can hear it from here. Andrea? - What? - Can you? Honey, you're gonna make yourself deaf. Did you need something? I need you to change your attitude, young lady. This came for you. My love, I feel like I'm finally settling in America. The church has provided a very nice room. The sanctuary is beautiful, and so big. Pastor Henry is an amazing man. He truly loves God and people. The church is always full on Sundays. I am counting the days until God brings us back together so we can be in church as a family. I cannot wait to show you the strange customs they have. Very different. Everything moves so fast here. Even their methods of cooking. There are wonderful foods you have never seen before, and I enjoy trying each of them. So much food. It is everywhere. And the most unusual names. My new favorite is called a corn dog. I cannot wait for you and Aimee to try one. It's good. It may sound odd, they put their garbage down the sink, and their dishes get cleaned by a box. But I think you will grow to like this custom. Until I hold you in my arms, I will think of you every day and dream of you every night. Kiss Aimee for me. I love you both with all my heart. Your loving husband, William. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. Hey, William! Ah! Greetings, Randy. Are you doing okay? - Where you going? - To the post office. - Well hope in, I'll take you. - Thank you so much. So what's up with the post office? I promised my wife and daughter I'll write them every day until they come to America. Every day, wow. When are they gonna join you here? I do not know. When I left them in Kenya we started the immigration paperwork, but approval is slow unpredictable, and very political. You know, if you need stamps I probably got some here. Thank you, but I have some stamps. Okay. Then why do you need to go to the post office? To mail my letter. - Your wife sends you letters. - Yes, every day. - Where do you get them? - From the black box at church. Okay. Did you know that you can actually send her letters from that same box? I don't need to send them from the post office? No. No, you can use the black box. I did not know this. So do you still need to go to the post office? Apparently not. Dear sweet husband, I thank God you are safe and doing well. America sounds so exciting. Aimee has been collecting photos of American cities and their people. She loves Dallas. But the days tick by so slowly. How I long to be with you again. We cherish the picture of you in front of the church. We cannot wait to see America with you. Some nights, Aimee wakes screaming for you. I comfort her, assuring her we'll be together soon. Yet my own nightmares of Rwanda haunt me. I am certain they will end once I'm in your arms. My life, my soul, my husband. Your loving wife. Hey, honey. Remember that guy I told you about from Rwanda? - Yeah. - Can you believe that his wife and daughter are still refugees from the war? I sure wish I knew how I could help them. Well, I know a family that could use your help. Our daughter stormed through the house, locked her door, and cranked that music. What's wrong? What'd she say? Oh, she said it was none of my business. None of your business? Andrea! Andrea, open the door right now! Excuse me, does the word "privacy" mean anything to you? Does the word "grounded" mean anything to you? Turn that music down! No, no, no. Turn it off! You and I are gonna have a little talk. You can't tell me what I listen to. Really? What're gonna listen to right now is me. I really don't know what's going on with you, Andrea. This music, the way you're talking back to your mother... What have you done to your face? I don't even recognize you anymore. I'm old enough to wear makeup. Is that so? I can't believe this is what I come home to. I don't know why you come home at all. Excuse me? You are always at work. Why don't you just have a bed and clothes at your office and live there? I work day and night to give you a bed and clothes. You wash that stuff off your face and change into something decent. And no more music! Dear Andrea, I hope all is well with you. I have not received a letter for some time. I pray nothing is wrong. Today, I am so excited. My mother is taking me to see my father. It is a long bus ride, but I do not mind. They don't allow visitors often so we are glad to make the journey. Mama, will he recognize me? He'll know, my child. As soon as he sees your beautiful eyes, he will know. Prisoner Mugenzi cannot see you today. What? - Why? - No visitors. But we came so far, and this is his daughter and he hasn't seen her. Woman, there are rules here. Sir, please. I have to see him. He left when I was a baby. I do not remember him. Please. I'm sorry. I cannot. Keza! Keza! Papa! Papa. My beautiful daughter. Look... look how grown you are. Keza. Oh, my sweet husband. It's so good to see you again. Yes, papa. When will you be coming home with us? Very soon, my dear. These walls cannot contain the love I have for you. I have to go. Till I see you again. Andrea, meeting my father was everythig I dreamt it would be. I never knew what it would feel like to have a father who loved me so much. My greatest prayer is that one day he will be released. You are so lucky to have your father. Dear Umuhoza, I'm so glad to hear you finally met your father. I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry I haven't written, but... something happened to me. Something terrible. I haven't told anyone. I'm too ashamed. - Denied? - That's what it says. But why? Woman, I see these every day. Man abandons his family, starts a new life somewhere else and they are left here without a clue. My husband has not abandoned us. He would never do that, he's an honorable man. Of course he is. So where is your marriage certificate? We lost everything in the war. That is why he went to America, - to build a new life for us. - Oh, America. But he has not given you a permanent address for your application. Because he is staying in a church. And all of you can stay there? - No, of course not, but... - The rules are very clear. No job, no residence, no visa. It's time you wake up. He's gone. But he sends us money. That's not proof. Maybe he has a guilty conscience. Consider yourself lucky. Next. Next! How long, Lord? How long must we wait? Why would you bring me to America and allow my family to suffer alone without me? They're in pain, and I feel a part of me is lost without them. Please, God, give me the wisdom to see your plan, for I lean on your faithfulness and I trust in your goodness, even when the valley is in darkness. Ebraille, it breaks my heart that I'm not there to comfort you and Aimee. I never imagined we would be apart for so long. I will send a piece of my heart in every letter I write. I cannot wait to be in your arms again. Yet I know I'm not the only refugee struggling to find his place in this country. I have discovered many others falling through the cracks of this society. - Thank you. - God bless you. I have prayed for them to find a home just as I have prayed to have you by my side once again. Your loving husband, William. So tell me about this idea of yours. Pastor Henry said I needed to hear it. Yes, yes. Well, let me explain. When I fled the genocide of Rwanda, I lost every material thing I ever owned. Friends were killed, my mother lost. It was a miracle how we escaped death several times. So now, I feel my time here on Earth as a loan from God, and I intend to live the rest of my days repaying that loan. A loan from God. So what can I do to help? Since I came to Nashville, I've met many other refugees struggling to get on their feet. Here is my idea. I heard one of the church members owns an apartment building near our church. Yes, Stevens. I told him it was a bad investment. It's never full. Exactly. - Put the refugees there. - Yes. The low rent to get them started, and when they find jobs and get established, - they pay more. - Interesting. Stevens get renters, the refugees, a place to live. Yes. And I believe in America you call it a "win-win." I know Stevens well. I'll set up a meeting for us. But you understand that place really needs work. - I mean, it's pretty broken down - Randy, God sees much beauty in the broken, and there are plenty of refugees who'd like to be a part of something. I think you may have something here, William. - We'll set it up. - Wonderful. It will help so many people, and I believe helping others always leads to healing. Huh! Your daughter is out of control. She is failing her classes, she quit cheerleading, and now wants to stop riding horses. You have to talk to her. Hello, William. Hi. Sorry you had to see all that. No worries, Randy. Young girls can be very unpredictable. - Challenging. - Tell me about it. We were in great danger fleeing Rwanda. And all Aimee could think about was saving a dress for her 15th birthday party. - Her 15th birthday party? - Yes. In our culture, every girl dreams of turning 15. It's a confirmation of the rites of passage. The day the girl becomes a woman. Sounds like a big day. It is. But Aimee's day has never been celebrated. She turned 15 in the refugee camp. It was hardly a time for a celebration. You'll be together soon. Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna set up a meeting with Stevens and Pastor Henry. We'll get this plan moving. Excellent. Thanks for your time. And... don't give up on Andrea. She's at a difficult age. And being a father takes all you have. No clay has ever become a beautiful pot without going through a little fire. Dearest Ebraille, God has provided a miracle. His plan was so wonderful. After much hard work and diligence, we opened a home for refugees today. Legacy Mission Village. It was bittersweet to open the doors without you by my side. But I find great comfort in seeing God transform so many painful eyes into beautiful expressions of joy. God's been revealing His purpose through this mission. He has shown me that our legacy is built from the pain and struggles we endure. And while I'm excited to see this vision grow, I cannot help but ask God's plan for our family. How can there be another season without you? I long to be with you and Aimee. And I trust that God will make a way soon. All my love, William. Here's my proof. My husband did not abandon us. He has a job and has made us a home. In fact, it's a whole village. Ebraille! Aimee! My sweet girl. Father. My dear husband, I have missed your face. My life, you're even more beautiful than the day I left you. I've missed you so much. Our hearts are finally together. We are home. ♪ Why ♪ ♪ Why, why, why Did we wait so long ♪ ♪ Did we wait so long ♪ ♪ I wanna know Please tell me now ♪ ♪ Why ♪ ♪ Why, why, why Did we wait so long ♪ Well, I would like to officially welcome the entire Mwizerwa family to America. It's been a long journey, William, and this family is thankful that your family is safe and together again. Here, here. Excuse me. Happy birthday, Aimee. For me, Father? Yes. Oh! I told you I would get you one even more beautiful than the first. It's amazing. I love you, Father. I love you too. Have you seen Andrea? No. She should've been here by now. I'm gonna go back to the house. Maybe she's there. No, I'll go. You should be here. She said a friend was dropping her off. Which friend? I wonder how you get emancipation. What? It's when a court lets a kid move out, even if they're not 18. Move out? You know, you're set for life. I'd take what you got any day of the week. Brad, you'd go crazy having Suzy Homemaker for a mom and a workaholic dad. I'd hate to grow up like my parents. Yeah, well, nobody wants to be their dads, do they? What time is it? Almost four. Oh, crap, crap, crap. Take me home! All right. Fine. Andrea! Andrea, get back here! Who was that? Andrea! Andrea! I am talking to you! Have you been drinking? Andrea! Who was that boy? Hello? I found her, and we have a problem. William, I've gotta go. I'm sorry. Finally. Randy, I cannot do this anymore! I know, I know. Who is this boy? I don't know. I've never seen him before, but they were drinking. What? Yes, Randy. I have been trying to tell you this for months! Something is different with her! Listen to me! You need to get involved with your daughter's life! Get involved? Oh, I'm involved. Do you think these bills magically pay for themselves? I work nonstop just to provide all this. And all I ask for is a peaceful place to come home to! - Maybe a little appreciation! - Randy! We are losing her! Andrea, open this door right now! Andrea? Lord, we are humbled by Your faithfulness. Thankful for bringing us safely through the valley, and hopeful for the purpose ahead of us. Thank you for Legacy Mission Village and all those who sacrificed to open these doors. May your blessing fall upon their lives and their families in the same way you have blessed us. Help us to realize each day that not even a sparrow falls without you knowing. We love you Lord. Amen. Amen. I can't sit here any longer. I'm gonna go look for her. Wanna come, sweetheart? I want to, I just think someone should be here if she comes home. Of course. Call me if she shows up. Randy. I love you. I love you too. - I'm so scared. - It's okay. The subscriber has traveled outside the service area. Please... God, where is Andrea? Please, keep her safe. I've done all that I know to do, and things are such a mess. So what are you gonna do now? I don't know. I'm not going home. You got 20 bucks? We could get a hotel room. Yeah, I think you've had one too many, big guy. Lord, I just can't fix this. But I'm putting her in Your hands now. Please, bring her home. Bring her home. -Hey. - Come here. - Brad, no. - Come here. - I said no, you're drunk! Shut and be still! Shut up and be still! - What is your problem? - Take me home! - Get out! - What? - Just get out! - I don't even know where we are! Ouch! Take me home! You just said you didn't wanna go home. Darla? Andrea, I cried when I read your letter. Now, I understand. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that horrible night. Some people are just pure evil. This was not your fault. It is not who you are. You are beautiful inside. Write soon, I am worried. Why would she go half a world away for help? This scares me. What did she tell Umuhoza? Why wouldn't she come to us? When did we lose her? Where did I fail? Randy, you have given us everything we could ever need. I know I've provided for her, but I didn't protect her. And what's killing me is that I don't know what I've failed to protect her from. Yes, this is Randy Hartley. Yes, I am her father. She what? She sounded so scared. Please hurry. I'm driving as fast as I can, honey. So what happens next, Lieutenant Scott? Well, Andrea's in a lot of trouble. We've dealt with Brad Bouton before. He's saying the drugs were hers. I just don't get it. Look, she seems like a good girl. But the court only sees evidence. Thanks for your help, Lieutenant. - Andrea, you promised us. - It's not my fault! - It's not your fault. - Mom, he tricked me. You rant about giving you space and then you pull this. I had no idea what he was doing! And I sure didn't think he was buying drugs! That's enough. Now, get in! Honey. You okay? Do you wanna go in and talk to her? What's left to say? I've failed as a father. Where did we lose her? Your daughter is out of contro. Why, God? Why? I really don't know what's going on with you, Andrea. I know a family that could use your help. I thought if I put it all in Your hands, I thought you were going to protect her! I've failed as a father. This scares me. I don't know why you come home at all. Where did I fail? Why is my family falling apart? This is what I come home to. I love you, Daddy. Where are you? Can you hear me? Are you even listening? Andrea, I am so excited. Even though it's not quite my birthday yet, I've already received a gift better than I could've imagined. Mugenzi! Father! My father was released from prison. He is home at last. I told you it wouldn't be long. Oh, I've dreamt of this day. Welcome home, my love. Yes, home. And I will never leave you again. I am so happy now. We are a family once again. Okay. Here's where we are. They have Andrea under surveillance in the car with the pills in her hand, which is all they'll need to convict her. - It's not true! - Andrea, enough. What we do have going for us is the fact that she's a first time offender. So we'll see if that holds in court. Bradly claiming that the drugs were hers. The case against us is pretty solid. Hope for sympathetic judge, we will make the court aware that nothing like this - has ever happened before. - Andrea? She just got caught up with the wrong people - and the wrong crowd... - Andrea? Andrea. We're next. Just to reiterate, because we put in a not guilty plea, there is a chance we could face a harsher sentence if the judge finds you guilty. The drugs weren't mine! I know. Would you give us a minute? Yeah. Just one minute. Listen, this is the last time I'm gonna tell you to keep your mouth shut and listen to what the fancy attorney tells you! You do what I say! He's your father? You should mind your own business. Oh, I see. Going to throw your father's voice on me. You're not comfortable with his voice. Oh, yeah? You just got it all figured out, don't you? No. Just you. Your life is not where you've come from. But what you do with the days before you. What did I tell you about talking to those people? Now, let's get in there. According to this affidavit, you claim that Andrea Hartley was in your truck with you in a neighborhood that multiple eye-whiteness say you frequent, with drugs from a dealer who has been arrested and states that you purchased them, but you want us to believe that they were hers. You just put the drugs in her purse when the cops showed up, didn't you? Objection. Overruled. But watch it, Counselor. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Bouton, you know what I do find hard to believe? The fact that a promising young man such as yourself is gonna let an innocent girl take the fall for your indiscretions. Now, tell us the truth about what happen. Guilty. What did you just say, young man? She's innocent. Brad, shut up! Don't ruin your life. I'm not. I bought those drugs, not her. Order in the courtroom. In light of this recent testimony, you're free to go, young lady. Court is adjourned. I understand your concerns, but Andrea and I are making progress. However, I don't believe she's completely opened up. Dr. Fischer, we didn't know what to do or even say to her at times. It's so confusing. Some days are so great and then there are times she's so disconnected. She just tuned out. Well, I'd like to suggest that we help Andrea by shifting her mindset. We just need to get her involved in something that focuses her mind on helping other people. I think I might know the perfect situation. Oh, my gosh, Daddy. She's so cute. - Hey, William. - Hey. Andrea came by because she wanted to ask you a question. Hmm. What's on your mind? Um, Mr. Mwizerwa, I'd like to volunteer here at Legacy Mission Village. Maybe help out with the kids? That's a wonderful idea, Andrea. You will be most welcome here. We are growing so fast and I hear good help is hard to find. Thank you so much. I mean, I can start any time. Hello. Looks like you already have. I guess so. Are you gonna get it? You have to look at me. Look how the children have taken to her. I have never seen them warm up to a new volunteer so fast. Well, she's closer to their age. We'll see how long this lasts. No, she has been broken. They sense her spirit, and they connect to her pain. Pain? What pain could she possibly have? She has everything. Aimee, speak gently of others. You do not know what paths they have traveled. I do not think her path has more difficult than ours. Just because you see no tears does not mean the person has not cried. Perhaps. Hey. Back to get her already? No. I, uh... I had an idea. Do you remember when I told you Andrea was writing to a girl in Rwanda? - Yes, Umuhoza, right? - Right. Well... she's the only one Andrea's ever really opened up to. - What if they were to meet? - Bring her to America? No, no. Take Andrea to Rwanda. Do you think that might help her? This is a most drastic plan, Randy. Rwanda is very different from America. So what're saying is we would need a guide. No, seriously, I mean, who better than you? Just the thought of going back is overwhelming. Why don't you talk to Ebraille and Aimee, and I'll see what Andrea thinks. Randy Hartley, I admire your courage. Andrea? So what do you think? - I love these kids. - Well, they sure like you. Hey, I was wondering, do you still write to Umuhoza? Um, no. I haven't written to her for some time. Maybe talking to her would be easier than writing her. I think it's time for me to make good on that promise I made to you. A trip to Africa. Really? This is for you. Andrea, I wish I could be there with yu just to hold your hand and cry together. You are not alone in this nightmare, Andrea. I'm here for you. Even though we have never met, you are my best friend. Dear Umuhoza, I'm sorry I haven't written for a while, but your last letter made me realize that true friends are always there for each other. A lot of things have changed. I'm seeing a councilor now. She's finally convinced my parents to give me some space. I've been working with the refugee kids at Legacy Mission Village. Things have been going great. My dad even took a whole day off of work just to spend time with me. Write back soon. Gotta run. P-S, how tall are you? It seems Andrea's really found her place there. Things are looking up for her and for us. I think so. Look, I know you're concerned about Rwanda. Mm-hmm. But I believe that this trip is really gonna help Andrea open up. When I look back, I feel like I need to tell you how much I respect everything you're doing for this family. The therapist, the trip to Rwanda. But especially taking off work for Andrea. Well, you two are what means most to me. How's it feel to be back, William? Oh, my gosh! - It is freezing! - Yes. Isn't Rwanda cool? Rwanda is gorgeous. I love it here. It is hard to believe I am back. What a fabulous meal. Not bad for goat, huh, Randy? Okay, okay. Ah. Jean Paul! Randy, Darla, this is Jean Paul, my oldest friend. We grew up together. Good evening. Pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure is mine. - Nice meeting you. It's hard to imagine there was ever a war here. - It is so beautiful. - Yes, but this is not the Rwanda I see when I close my eyes. Get out of the car now! Come! At the roadblock, we just knew we were going to die. - My dress! - Come! Listen! You shut up and you be still! Be still! I was just waiting for my turn to die. But what we did not know was that God had a miracle in store for us. The faces, the sounds. They never leave me. Aimee, I had no idea. How do you live with the pain? As my father reminds me, everyone is broken in some way, Andrea. God loves us through our pain, our past, our fear. I just stood there. I couldn't move. Andrea. Now, tell me, what's next on your adventure? Tomorrow, Murambi. We're going to surprise the child that Randy's family sponsors, on her 15th birthday. - Oh, big celebration. - Yes. So you're going to see your aunt while you're still I'm Murambi? Aunt Natalie? Yes, the one who used to run us out of the kitchen. - She's still alive? - Very much alive. Still living in the same old shack. Perhaps she knows what happened to Mother. I... I should've screamed, run, something. I should've known better. Oh, dear, it was not your fault. How could you know what that monster was going to do? You must learn to forgive yourself. I don't know how. I can't forget it. Andrea, I cannot tell you that you will ever forget what happened, but I do not believe your past has to ruin your future. Who knows how God will use your pain to touch others. Andrea! He doesn't know, does he? He'll be so disappointed in me. No. He loves you. Now is your chance to trust him. There you are. Daddy. I need to tell you something... but I don't know how to start. Okay. Okay, sweetheart. Let's talk. I've been angry at you... at Mom. - And I just want to... - Andrea, I know I haven't been around much in the past. Ever since the night you ran away, - I've really been trying to... - No, Daddy, you have been. What I'm trying to say... is I'm just ashamed - and embarrassed. - Hey. It's okay, honey. I love you. Something horrible happened to me at the Fourth of July. It was this guy, and he hurt me really badly, Daddy. I couldn't tell you before because I was too scared and I thought you'd be mad at me. Come here. I am so sorry, sweetheart. You are so beautiful, and I love you more than you could ever, ever imagine. Mom. All right. Everybody ready? We're waiting on William. I'll go check on him. It went well last night? Yes, Aimee. Thank you for everything you shared yesterday. I never thought I'd talk about that with anyone. Well, I think it makes today's celebration even more beautiful. Yes. Umuhoza has no idea we're coming. She's going to be so surprised. And she's gonna love this. Found him. We are good to go. I could not reach Jean Paul. I hope he got our message to Aunt Natalie. He said he would. We must not worry. Why are you so nervous? She's family. - Aren't you excited? - Yes, but my aunt was an orphaned Hutu girl adopted by my Tutsi family. She and my mother were raised as sisters, but the genocide divided the people of Rwanda. Hutu versus Tutsi. I have not seen her since the war began. But I cannot wait to see her expression when she opens the door. Yeah. Matisse. My son. Were you expecting someone else? Come inside. Your cousin William is back in Rwanda, - coming here today. - William is back? It can only mean one thing. He wants revenge. After all these years? Why else would he return? He must know what happened. So be it. I've carried this guilt for years. It is time to face the truth. I won't let him take your life. What is left to take? The biggest part of me died 15 years ago. Aunt Natalie, it's me, William. Your sister's son. I played in your yard as a boy. Yes, William, I remember. You remember my wife, Ebraille. We have a present for you. Come inside. I'm sorry, I do not have anything for you in return. My dear aunt, you have something very precious that you can give me. I'd like very much to know what happened to my mother. It has troubled me all these years not knowing. Then I'm afraid... that you'll not find comfort in the story that I have to tell you. The truth is my comfort. It was a time of chaos. Fear. And great confusion. The Hutu Militia ran into Murambi killing every Tutsi they could find. Fear served the city. And I knew that your mother would be running out of food and water. So I went to help. You need to get off the streets. The militia are everywhere. Quickly, come inside. No, they are going door-to-door. Come with me. You cannot stay here. I am Hutu. You'd be safe with me. Come. Matisse, is that you? - No! - Quiet. No. No! No! What have I done? William, this betrayal has haunted my soul, knowing that my own blood has taken the one closest to you. I love your mother and I love you as much as my own son. If you've come for revenge, I'm prepared for the consequences to be free from this pain. Revenge? It has been said, an eye for an eye. But if we were all to live by this idea, we will all become blind. I lay down this machete... just like I lay down my right for revenge. I cannot set you free from your pain, my sweet aunt, but holding on to the past will only destroy what lays before us. But what I can do is forgive. William, I do not know how you have found the place in your heart to forgive me and my son. Forgiveness is the only way I know how to let go. I will no longer carry the cold age of the past with me. I see her strength in you. She would be very proud of the man you've become. Andrea! I cannot believe my eyes! I wouldn't dream of missing my best friend's 1th birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. This is the most beautiful dress I have ever seen. - So, 155 centimeters. - You are very sneaky. Full of surprises. Well, let's try it on. You must be Andrea's father. - Yes, I'm Randy Hartley. - Mugenzi. I am amazed I can thank you in person. Do you know your generosity came to us at our greatest time of need. So I would like to thank you... for being a faithful father to my daughter when I couldn't be. Thank you. I don't always feel that way. But really, I should be thanking you. I can't express how much your daughter means to us. Her friendship has saved our family. Forgive me. This is my wife, Darla. It's so nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. And these are our friends, the Mwizerwas. They're from Rwanda, but they live in the U.S. now. And our journey would never - have been... - Could it be? Do you remember me? Brother... how could I forget? You spared our lives. God has honored my prayer, allowing me to thank you. Praise be to God. Praise be to God. Oh. Hey. You look like a princess. Thank you. It is in the darkest of times that our character is truly tested, our faith challenged. I left Rwanda in tragedy with my family at risk, our future unknown. Yet I return to the land of my fathers with a family brought together from the hardships of life and the faithfulness of a God who loves us, placing the pieces of our brokn lives back together in a way that is even more beautiful than we could have imagined.
