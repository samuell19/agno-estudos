"I'm sorry, I was wrong." Understanding the mistake, admitting it. The truth always cured me. I've finally found a way to say it, and it's this story, this movie. So I'm gonna tell it for real. After a three-year absence, Tiziano Ferro, a few months away from his 40th birthday, is back with a new album. I left at the end of the month With no pretension MILAN NOVEMBER 21, 2019 I left for a few days And I'm still away Milan. The temperature changes when a new album comes out. The wait is over. Meeting who listened to the album is exciting, but there's that permanence which scares me. I think, "What will they think? Are they waiting for me, happy, "bored, tired, excited?" That's the moment. I noticed it from the beginning. The first drop comes down. You're about to get wet, you're not sure when and how the storm will be over, right? I think this is the core and the essence of my job. Don't touch me because I hate you Don't erase me because I need to Be kept in your mind Until I prove the dream false And I will laugh until it is over And I understand you because it's the same Melancholy as when everything is back And nothing stays What shall I leave you of me? And what shall I take of you? I'll take a tattoo, I'll take that night I'll take this tear What will you leave me of you? And what will you take of me? Choose a song Choose my silence I choose not to see you again A new life starts From the color of a withered rose Few ideas I've got, always the same No more promises, I promise And I changed, and I changed And even if it's the last stop I leave my life much better Than how I found it Than how you left it How you left it And with everything I've seen It's hard to understand if I exist And despite everything I look at myself Now and then I wonder where you go Motionless behind the obstacles I accept miracles It's about to be midnight in Europe, in Italy. The new album Accetto Miracoli is about to come out, after almost three years. I hadn't made a record out of a personal crisis for a long time. You embrace the crisis and turn it into inspiration, tears, smiles, songs. Since I was a kid, music has always been the only thing I've had, like a channel to express myself in a world where I didn't feel I belonged. Tiziano Ferro. The beats fall down From the clock And they don't stop They set me apart From those infinite moments Into your arms Incomprehensible... I was never the first of the class. Always the second, the third. Anonymous. I wasn't handsome, not athletic at all. In fact, I was fat. Shy. Girls trusted me, 'cause they didn't think I was a threat, boys used to call me "fatso," "pussy," "loser." And if I didn't help them pass the test, they would wait for me outside. I was never able to defend myself. I hoped in vain somebody would do that for me, and I was constantly feeling frustrated. And pissed off. And even humiliated. And I was ashamed, so I didn't tell anything to my parents. But then, I sang for the first time, and everything changed. ...one more minute and then We look each other in the eyes I want to watch your eyes Falling asleep your Eyes Your eyes Your eyes Excuse me. After the theme song, Tiziano will enter from the side and will make a speech about bullying, as close-up as possible. Come on, Tiziano! -That one. Perfect. -Yeah, the close-up is this one, Tiziano. There's no tolerance. I've lived my whole life destroyed by comments and attacks because I was fat, I was a misfit, I was different, I was... I always had some issue, and every time one of them was solved, there came a new one. I mean, if you're unpopular in your DNA, you'll always be. Now I'm 40, I have the ability to filter this information, I don't care. I stop and step back. But I couldn't when I was young, and it's thanks to music that I'm alive now, 'cause it always gave me a window through which I could scream. It saved me, 'cause there are some more subtle forms of decline than poverty, than, than, than, than... Than war... Those are very bad forms of decline, but inner decline is no better. Words have a weight, but we tend to forget it. This is the tragedy behind bullying. Words have a weight. I repeat, they're dangerous, and be aware of that when you unleash them onto a teenager who is too fragile to choose or decide. Words have a weight. Fat, slut, midget, misfit, faggot, criminal, nigger, hag, redneck, spoilt, beggar, retarded, whore, loser, anorexic, wuss, handicapped, frigid, inferior, moron! Words have a weight, in life and on the screens. And please, let's stop defending ourselves by bringing up humor and sarcasm. Not everybody manages to do that. Meanwhile, I'll wait for the day when words will have a weight, maybe. Thank you. See you later. I started as a choirboy when I was 17. While at the Sanremo Academy, I met Mara Maionchi and Alberto Salerno, her husband, who made me sign a contract with their company. So, when I was 18, I was feeling like I was at the center of the universe. Then, there were three years of oblivion and frustration, doors shut in my face. My producers only got rejections, they thought my songs were amazing, but there was always tension due to my being overweight. So, I stopped eating and I went from 111 to 70 kilos. And the worst part is that everybody was telling me that I was handsome. The weird thing is that shortly after, they made me sign a contract for a single. Five letters, Xdono. Tiziano Ferro! -Forgive me -What's done is done but I am -Sorry -Smile at me and I'll give you a -Rose -Upon this friendship a new peace is -Laid -'Cause I know what I'm like and I ask you -Forgive me -What's done is done but I am -Sorry -Smile at me and I'll give you a -Rose -Upon this friendship a new peace is -Laid -Forgive me... The first fans started to arrive. I just wanted to go home after performing. I didn't have energy, 'cause I was eating little to nothing, but when you're 21, you try to live with that. Every morning I used to put on a body which wasn't mine. It was like I was wearing a costume, I dressed up as a thin boy. The pain and the hunger made it impossible for me to enjoy those 40 kilos I had lost. I acted and thought always like a fat guy. -Are you in a relationship? -I'm free! Like the sun, like the air. Then, the big problem arose. As if my relationship with food and my body wasn't enough. My producers looked at me and told me that at the record company people were saying that I was gay, and that that was an issue. They thought the same way abroad, too, and they wanted to erase that issue. What's up? "Why don't you have a girlfriend, so some paparazzi can take photos of you two?" I was shocked, because the problem wasn't just mine anymore. At my French record company, they even hired a stylist who used to wait for me at the airport in Paris, he took me to the bathroom and gave me more masculine clothes. I decided not to lie about girlfriends. I continued to prepare my album. At dark Nights When there's no time, there's no space And nobody will ever understand You can Stay, because it hurts It hurts, it hurts so much Without, without you... In 2004, there was a moment which really struck me, when he won the MTV Awards in Rome. FABRIZIO GIANNINI TIZIANO FERRO'S MANAGER That was a great, wonderful moment, an unforgettable night. In Rome, his city. After his performance, we were all at the hotel, happy, but he looked weird. I couldn't understand why, but he was sad. I went to talk to him, he burst into tears and told me, "I can't do it anymore. "I can't. This job is stressing me out." He worked a lot, was tired, but there was something which made him sad. I never drank during my youth. It's crazy, I was basically the perfect teenager. I didn't smoke, I didn't... I didn't smoke marijuana, my friends used to get drunk and I didn't even drink beer. But during my first tour... I was really happy, but I felt completely disconnected from my band and everything going on. Like a drop in the ocean. One night, I remember my band convinced me to drink. And... And I never stopped since then. I always used to drink alone. I went to pubs, bars, clubs, every day. I went to nightclubs just because I could drink until late there. I was there, in my bubble, vacuum-sealed. Or I stayed home, with my bottle and the music, looking in the mirror. Alcohol gave me the strength not to think about the pain or the sadness. But it also gave me the insanity which made me wanna die more and more often, even though I was scared of it. Looking back, I realize I screwed up a lot. Because of alcohol I lost job opportunities, I lost friends, I lost my dignity, I lost my health. I could have lost even more of it. I still have the... The blood test during my worst moment, when transaminases suggested that, well, my liver wasn't okay. But it didn't stop me, the answer was always, "I'll be in control." I was an alcoholic. One day, he told me, "Fabrizio, I need to talk to you, alone." We sat on my couches, facing each other. But he was looking at the wall, not me. That day, he told me, at my place, crying... FABRIZIO GIANNINI TIZIANO FERRO'S MANAGER ...that he couldn't hide his homosexuality anymore and that he was willing to give up everything and stop with that lifestyle. He cried, and cried... At some point, I told him, "Tiziano, don't worry. "It would be a pity if you gave up your artistic life, you're too talented. "Let's face it together and let's try to find a way to do that." And, let me tell you, he felt protected, helped. That was a moment which really brought us together so much. I thought I would never find love, and I came out 'cause I wanted to find it. But my addiction was stronger, so I was always alone. Due to a lot of faults. I was alcoholic, bulimic, gay, depressed, every... famous. Famous. That felt like a fault to me, maybe the worst one. One day, during a meeting in Milan, a new, broken guy, it was his third or fourth day of sobriety, he came in, waited until the end of the meeting, and then told me, "I can't do it anymore, and I didn't want to come here, either. "I decided I would just come in and leave immediately." And then he said, "But then I saw you, "and since I admire you so much, I decided to stay. "And if you're here, I believe that I should come back." I think he was 25 years old. I think that anybody, artists, writers, who work in this field should teach others. As adults, we should explain to kids what's gonna happen, 'cause this is a job you never learn. Not even while doing it, you just learn it by collecting a series of mistakes. But when you come from a small or simple reality, it's very easy to fall into an abyss of insecurity. Non-acceptance, depression, anxiety, addictions. You carry all of them with you. Even when you face them, somehow you find a way to live with them. And if you're lucky, you can even make peace with them, sometimes. LOS ANGELES JANUARY 2020 Now I'm not a burden anymore Tell me, what are your excuses now? Very good, there you go. You'll say you have no time You'll say that everything's off You'll say that now You love yourself a little more You'll say that now you're strong And you'll close all the doors Laughing you'll find an excuse One more One more And I was so happy, you were late And I was waiting for you downstairs Hold my hand and let's leave Deep down you were so happy... ...you didn't care About the rain falling down One candle was beautiful And the thought Of the memory which suggested us That sooner or later I would tell you That I was so happy But I never told you... A teacher in Los Angeles, fan of Tiziano Ferro, uses his songs to teach Italian. Tiziano participates in one of her lessons for the first time. Hi! Hello, Tiziano. Hi. -How are you? Good morning! -Good morning. I feel embarrassed 'cause you're too good. Shall I speak Italian and ask you some questions? They prepared some questions for you. I want to ask some questions, too. We can be informal, right? -Of course! Who wants to start? -Who goes first? -What's your name? -My name... My name is Gracie. -Gracie, nice to meet you. -What's your favorite animal? I... have a problem. I love animals more than people. I just love animals. I have two dogs, Penny, Piper. I adopted them when they were 12 and 13 years old. -Now they're 15 and 16 years old. -Wow! -Are they big or small? -No, dachshunds. -Do you have a question? -Yes, I do. -What's your dream? Yeah. -My dream in life? I'd like to have... kids. "Figlio," kids, right? "Figli," plural. ...and that is my dream now. Thank you very much for the question. Let's start with your question in Italian. -What was like, "Com'è stato." Good. -"Com'è stato." What was like. In Italian we use the same word as in English, "coming out." Coming out "in Italia." And my answer is... I did it for me, because I was 30 and I lived in complete denial, in a society that didn't accept who I was and I didn't accept myself. I couldn't even look in the mirror anymore. I started to do therapy, and I understood that the problem was loving myself. And as soon as I did, I decided to talk to my friends, my family and my fans about it, at a time when in Italy no artist had ever come out and it's still like that. A lot of people thought that was an artistic suicide, but the honesty, the sincerity brought me even closer to people. And if you don't love yourself and that side of yourself, So, I did it for me, no matter if morality in Italy is still a little "wobbly." The truth set me free. It's all I wanted. -Shall we sing, now? -Yeah, let's do it. And I was so happy, you were late And I was waiting for you downstairs Hold my hand and let's leave Deep down you were so happy When looking at Amsterdam you didn't care About the rain falling down One candle was beautiful And the thought Of the memory which suggested us That sooner or later I would tell you That I was so happy But I never told you That I was asking God Again, again, again And my memory will come to you When you feel too bad, but when you... ...because everything I've always asked Is this life... And deep down I was so happy, you were late And I was waiting for you downstairs Hold my hand and let's leave Deep down you were so happy When looking at Amsterdam you didn't care About the rain falling down One candle was beautiful And the thought of the memory Which suggested us That sooner or later I would tell you That I was so happy But I never told... After living in Mexico and England, Tiziano Ferro moved to Los Angeles where he's been living for four years with his husband Victor Allen. The thing is, you move from town to town, you meet a thousand people, you live a lot of experiences, you even get married! Love, friends, everything's fine. But life goes on, with doubts, uncertainties. It never stops. Eternal happiness doesn't exist. Faults come back. But the best thing is that you don't have to be happy or perfect all the time. You're not alone in your imperfection anymore, you're both imperfect, for real. Maybe that's the real strength of that seal. Anyway, I feel naked when I take off my wedding ring. -I think that you need to run it again. -That's funny. In America, they can't have just white eggs, they need to have white, pink, dark eggs. Okay, let's make a white, a pink, and a dark one. VICTOR ALLEN TIZIANO FERRO'S HUSBAND "It's not like you." When people told me, "It's not like you," I realized how little they knew about me. I mean, that short sentence made me realize how far I was from them. "It's not like you." And I automatically thought, "What do you know about me? "You don't know me and you never will." Then, one day, I received another "It's not like you." Just like that, Victor said it to me while looking at a shirt I was given as a gift. I had heard that opinion before, but that time, I didn't think, "What do you know about me?" 'cause that didn't make sense for the first time. And absurdly, thanks to that stupid thing I realized how well Victor knew me. Hurry up. Your daughter! -Fabrizio! -Everybody's called Maurizio. I'm really grateful for this new family. When I'm away, I miss them, in Italy. They even text me, saying they miss me, I know it's true, they're 80, they don't need to lie. VOICE OF VICTOR ALLEN TIZIANO FERRO'S HUSBAND I've accepted the idea that my nomad life is made of several pieces, never just one. It's like a puzzle that makes sense when it's put together. If there's one thing I understood, is that all these pieces are geographically far from each other now. They're fewer and fewer and I accept them for what they are and wherever they are. Here's California, Latina, Milan. I'm glad he's living in Los Angeles. He's a peaceful man now. Popularity suffocated him. Not being able to go eat a pizza with his friends or go grocery shopping would suffocate him. He's always run away to find his own world, his own simplicity. Grocery shopping is one of the most important symbols of my life in America. When my American friends, like, from America, ask me, "Will you ever do a tour here in America?" I answer, "The only tour I like to do is the one among the aisles of the supermarket." Grocery shopping almost regenerates me. I'm hyperactive, that's why I've always lived abroad, 'cause I wanna feel free to do whatever I want. I write a lot. I write at home, in cafes, at bars. Here I've regained contact with writing in the urban environment, meaning that I get inspired while walking. And then, four or five days per week I'm busy with the recovery group, I'm the secretary or sponsor. No judgment, no pointing fingers, just people with the same problems helping each other. David was my first sponsee, the first person who asked me to help him. Seeing him facing his own difficulties was an absolute privilege to me. VICTOR ALLEN TIZIANO FERRO'S HUSBAND This is good! We met here and became like a family, a community where we support each other. I like that, despite being famous, he's a really simple man. BIANCA BALTI TIZIANO FERRO'S FRIEND VOICE OF VICTOR ALLEN TIZIANO FERRO'S HUSBAND Come on... No! -Humiliated, huh? -Wait, wait. -It's not over yet? -There's still time. -No way! -It's an own goal! That's an own goal! You're so bad at it! With this ring... PRIVATE IMAGES OF VICTOR AND TIZIANO'S WEDDING IN LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES JUNE 25, 2019 With this ring... I give you my heart... And marry you... The love of my life. It is my privilege to present to you for the first time Mr. and Mr. Tiziano and Victor Allen Ferro. SABAUDIA JULY 13, 2019 I told him immediately, Victor is the one for you. I was right. GIULIANA TIZIANO FERRO'S MOTHER PRIVATE IMAGES OF VICTOR AND TIZIANO'S WEDDING IN ITALY "From now on I will share my life with a man who makes me laugh "and makes me happy. A very shy man, "who hates being in the spotlight. "Universally reserved, on the cover of Vanity Fair. "And now I also have new friends who are so love... "Lover..." No. Lovers. -Say it again? -Loving. "Loving, sweet and genuine. "And an amazing new family. "I have a little brother who is fun, witty and authentic. "A strong and loving mom "who makes a lasagna that makes me cry. -"A pope... Papa! -Papa! "Papa. "A tender and loyal papa who welcome... "Welcomed me with open arms from the first day. "We're celebrating love, family and friendship. "And with these three things, a wonderful life is possible!" "Dad, how many maxims of wisdom? How much love and support? "Like when you told me, 'Yeah, okay, but we beat Americans big time! "'We invented the elevator while they were still hunting buffalos with spears!' "But then you also said that, even if I'm so far away, "you've never seen me so happy "and that's what you want. "Mom! "Yes, my mom. Hi, Mom. "When I told her that I had a boyfriend, she said, 'Let me see a picture of him.' "I gave her my phone, "with a keen eye she scrolled through four or five pictures on the phone. "She looked at me with a sweet smile on her face, "so deep and tender that only a mother can have, and said, "'Fifty?' "And she was right, by the way. "But when Victor texted her, 'I'm glad I'll be your son-in-law,' she replied "right away, 'You already are to me.' "But let's get back to us, Victor. You taught me to have faith. "I've always believed in real love. The one and only, perfect and absolute. "Nothing less, ever. I've spent my whole life "looking for unconditional love, the one that makes you feel young again "and makes you cry and laugh spontaneously. "I've always loved silence. It was me against the world. "Now I listen to your voice in the next room and I feel at home. "I can't wait for you to come back, to walk together or stop when we need to. "Because it's me... "and my love, ready to change the world. Maybe not today, "'cause today is our day. To my friends, my family and eternal love." Thanks, guys. Thank you, thank you so much. -Hey, guys! How are you? -We're great, welcome. I'm so glad I can finally say at 2:00 a.m. in a press conference from Teatro del Casinò in Sanremo, "Tiziano Ferro is going to be at the Ariston every night!" -Yes! Tell me about it. -My God, that's wonderful. VOICE OF AMADEUS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR SANREMO 2020 I must say, everybody was shocked, 'cause there were some rumors about it, but they thought it was, well... Just a rumor, fake news, and so on, So, when I confirmed it, everybody was like, "Oh my goodness! "Oh, gosh, so you're serious about it." Of course! I'm really happy, anyway. I hug you and I'm looking forward to February. Bye! There he is! Look at him. -American Gigolo is no comparison. -Hey, Tiziano, thanks. -How are you? -I'm fine. How can you not, in this city? -Sanremo will be staggering. -Sanremo is great, huh? Are you going through all the songs today? -Well, "Almeno tu nell'universo" okay. -Yeah. -You said it seemed long, but... -No, we can't cut covers like that. No, no, let's leave everything for God's sake. Stoning All the dreams which are still flying I will drop them down one by one I will break the wings of fate And I'll have you by my side Losing love It's pretty tough. Holy shit. Beautiful. When a song is so important to you, the thing is, it touches you so much... that it affects your performance. Anyway, this... With a few rehearsals, I can do it. -I have to do it. -It's the first time you sang it. No, no, and with Massimo... -I have to do it! -What else did you want to try? Almeno tu nell'universo, let's start from the beginning. Okay, here it goes. Go. You know People are strange... I'm working a lot, there's a lot to do. Five days at Sanremo will be inevitably imperfect, something will go wrong, something else will go right. Doesn't matter, my only mission is to live the best experience of my life. First the truth then He will lie With no seriousness I'm sorry, Marco, stop for a sec. I need to review something from the second verse. -I would go from the second verse. -As soon as the intro starts? Okay. Go. You know People are crazy Maybe they're too unsatisfied They follow the world blindly When fashion changes They change too Continuously Foolishly You, you are different SANREMO FEBRUARY 4, 2020 70TH ITALIAN SONG FESTIVAL FEBRUARY 4-8, 2020 At least you in the universe Will not change Tell me you'll always be honest Tiziano is going to perform as a special guest for the five nights of the Festival. And you'll really love me More, and more, and more, and more I started to dream of becoming a singer thanks to Sanremo, because it's really... It's so unique and surreal. And for me is like, well, the Mecca, basically. You will not change Tell me You'll always be honest And you'll really love me Really love me more Thank you, thanks a lot. So, here we go. It's time. I am so excited. Tonight, at Sanremo Festival 2020, Tiziano Ferro!

Oh, bullshit! No! -No way! -Why did I freeze in the end? No! -"Freeze?" What are you talking about? -I tried it a hundred times! What the fuck? -I couldn't do it. -It was incred... I mean... -It was amazing. I mean... -Everybody understood it. -It's a really tough song! -It stings, it stings... -My favorite part. -Come on, you were so authentic... I screwed up 'cause I... You were so authentic, and people saw that! I shouldn't have looked up! I'm an asshole, I really am. -Come on! It went well. It was touching. -Everybody is writing of you. -You're the only one who... -No, but I'm sorry I froze. -Whatever, who cares? -I mean, I felt my throat, like, closing. I tried it, like, a billion times and... Something happened, I still don't get it, it never happened in my life. I felt a noose around my neck and I couldn't sing anymore. FEBRUARY 5, 2020 2ND SECTOR Tiziano! No! Good evening! Losing love He was so nervous, we exchanged several texts. He was positively tensed, expected a lot, but he didn't want to disappoint, either. And that's so generous and humble that it hit me. When he goes on stage, he still feels that thrill, that leap in the dark. Even more when it's Sanremo. Tonight, two great artists who've never sung together before, Tiziano Ferro and Massimo Ranieri with "Perdere l'amore!" Stoning All the dreams which are still flying I will drop them down one by one I will break the wings of fate And I'll have you by my side Losing love Losing Love The week in Sanremo was an explosion of a million different things. Stress, joy, union, hugs, tears. I just remember the good things. And I feel like who can still cry At my age And I always thank who can cry At night at my age And my life, you gave me so much Love, joy, pain, everything But thanks to who can forgive At the door at my age... Once Sanremo is over, we go back to reality, right? It's like Wonderland going back into the book, and see you next year. ...God told me to And you have to listen To what he says At night at my age At night at my LATINA FEBRUARY 19, 2020 Tiziano Ferro then goes to his family in Latina to celebrate his 40th birthday. Latina is the city of roundabouts and they didn't make one here. Here they are! Hi, paparazzi! Oh, God, there are four... You know, Poor them, they complain because we have a super boring life. They always tell me, "Can't you do something, some party? Like, go around, do something?" And I say, "Guys, "this is our life, we don't do it on purpose! "We met each other and we found our better halves, "the halves of retirement. That's the way we are!" I feel sorry for them. They say, "You only go to the laundromat, in and out." That's what we do! Life is already tragic. This is the stadium where I did three concerts for my first album. SEPTEMBER 15, 2002 "E. MAJORANA" HIGH SCHOOL - LATINA Thanks for buying this album. FEBRUARY 20, 2020 Either you stay trapped in the province or you leave. If you do, you're stronger. Especially because you bring it with you, 'cause it's like a lesson to you. That's what Latina is for me. And my music started from here. This is a special place, it has a special place in my heart. I was 20 and I was having a walk, when a sentence came to my mind, and I had to write it down 'cause it's kind of crazy. "What's done is done "but I am sorry." I wrote "forgive me" to remember it, but since I was in a rush, I wrote "forgive me" with a "4". Everybody knows the rest of the story. Years later, I revealed that this bench was my sanctuary, like the intro of the song which changed my life, and a lot of fans from all over Italy and the world came to write on it. Then, when the park was being renovated, there was a popular uprising because nobody wanted this bench to be taken away, so it was left, while all the others are different. -Forgive me -What's done is done but I am -Sorry -Smile at me and I'll give you a -Rose -Upon this friendship a new peace is -Laid -'Cause I know what I'm like and I ask you -Forgive me -What's done is done but I am -Sorry -Smile at me and I'll give you a... CORI (LT) MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHPLACE When I listen to "In Mezzo A Questo Inverno," I think about Grandma. She was forged like a stone from the last century, made to last. Always up for anything, for me. When I saw her eyes closed, I felt like I was falling apart. Like, when I was 19, I needed to escape and I went to live with her for a while. That time, however, I recovered. The day of the funeral, Victor was with me. That's when I found the compass, when I figured out the sense of this trip. On the day I had feared all my life, there was the person I had been looking for my whole life. I mean, family goes on. Love doesn't end. What a wonderful lesson. Once again, Grandma. You were there, you were there You were there Among this winter Telling me it's better a minute of peace Than an eternity of war But for now, by chance or luck Now I am too scared You've always been stronger Maybe I will have to be stronger Now Shall we sing this together or not? In the summer of 2002, I did a concert in the stadium of my hometown. It was... SEPTEMBER 14, 2002 ROSSO RELATIVO TOUR ...as if it was the first and last time. I can't even explain. The first and last time. It still happens, when I enter a stadium. I think, "Enjoy it, 'cause it may not happen again." The idea of nothing being taken for granted is something that... I cannot get over it, and I don't want to, either. It started here, I remember. I said to myself, "Tiziano, look carefully. Don't forget, "'cause it's a privilege which might not come back." Thank you! If I'd been asked, "How do you picture yourself at 40?" Here, with my family. 'Cause I can go to Los Angeles, England, I can go wherever I want, but I know where my blood comes from. I feel it. And looking at this stadium, this town, walking on it and seeing all the love the people from here and my family gave me, it is the only thing that matters and helps me looking in the mirror and thinking that's fine, at the age of 40. Scars play an essential role in life, you know? Even if our parents always try to protect us, all the scars, non-acceptance, the relationship with addictions, even eating disorders, you know? Today I consider them my superpowers. I look at the world through the lens of my scars. The greatest consequence of addiction is isolation. Addiction wants you alone. Then I met the groups here in Los Angeles and it immediately turned into a world of love of friends, union, welcoming, it was like starting over again. Here, I really understood what sobriety meant. I'm the secretary of this meeting. My job is to organize the meetings, where a group of people spontaneously meet up to confront each other, keep their sobriety alive and help the others. Nobody could stand me when I used to drink. And the ones who could either felt pity or they were like me, or even worse. The day I realized I needed help was when, for the first time, I couldn't go a whole day without drinking, 'cause my body had no other choice. When I went to my first meeting in England, I almost had an out-of-body experience, 'cause I looked at that place, a convention center, with rooms on rent, but really ugly. I looked at it, I looked at the people coming in and I thought that I was in the wrong place 'cause people looked too normal to me. It was funny, 'cause even there, the arrogance of... Or the naivety of considering myself one in a million, you know? But it wasn't like that. I mean, I entered that room... I don't know, I mean, it... It... Everything seemed in its right place. Then I don't know why, I mean... I'm getting emotional now because I've just remembered a lady who... She was English, and she welcomed me telling me something that I... I didn't understand at first. And I don't want to cry right now. I didn't understand her at first, but I did later. She told me, "Well done, you're doing a brave thing." I felt like I was doing a stupid thing, I mean, I was just going there, not doing anything, blending among chairs and hoping that magic would happen. But no magic happened, 'cause you have to work your ass off. Wait, I can do it. Okay. So, yeah, I didn't understand her, that's true, but fuck it, I've never left. So, I always say that to the newcomers. Because maybe it won't work, but if it does as it did with me, I am happy. I always tell them, "Don't worry, "it will be better. You're doing a brave thing..." And from that moment, I started a nice journey, really nice. I'm sick of... Of not talking about this solution, 'cause it became... It's the best story of my life, the one which restored my life. A lot of people have asked me, "Where does this serenity come from? "You can see it is love, it's having rediscovered a perspective." Yeah, probably, but the truth is, leaving this house, this subjugation through recovery restored everything. Hope, serenity. And... And it's time for me to share this solution with people, 'cause it's the only reason why I'm still here talking right now. FEBRUARY 21, 2020 This is exactly how I pictured my 40th birthday. With my families. The one I was born with and the one I chose, so thank you. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Tiziano Happy birthday to you It was all a ruin, but clearly you need to demolish before starting to build again, right? Happy endings do exist. It doesn't matter how you fall, but how you get back up. If you do nothing, people'll remember your fall. But if you recover well, they will remember how you got back up. I just thought how useless it is to rant And think I'm fine When it's winter and you Take your warm hands off me Don't hug me and say I'm old enough You remind me that I live on Through many things Houses, books, cars, trips Sheets of newspaper That even if I'm worthless, at least I let you dream And walk, if you want I'm sorry, I don't want to bother you But can you tell me how this could end? I can't explain it I can't explain it FROM AN IDEA OF TIZIANO FERRO I want to give you my life I ask you to change all my life, now I'll give you this news in conclusion You see, news is an anagram of my name And I know you need time, I don't deny it Even if there is no time after all But if you look for me You'll see me The most secret affection Eludes the man who never looks ahead
