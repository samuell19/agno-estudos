You know, I just realized you're drinking wine again. Mm-hmm. I am. Arianna saw Daniel using a sippy cup on a video chat, and she is a convert. She always wants to do everything that he's doing. - Ohh! - So, I welcome caffeine, spicy foods, and... the nectar of the gods back into my life. Cheers to that! Cheers. Mm. One more thing for you to look forward to, Tracy. Oh... hard pass. Nick and I are sure that we should not be responsible for another human being. He is managing his restaurants all night long, I'm running the auction house all day. I'm asleep when he comes home at night, he's asleep when I go to work in the morning, and that is pretty much the entirety of our relationship. But it's not like I don't talk to him about it. I have tried, and he always has these really helpful suggestions of changes... I could make. That you can make? - Mm-hmm. - You never had a honeymoon, did you? Avery, we haven't been in a room together long enough to decide where to go. That's okay, you'll figure it out. How? What do you mean, "how"? I mean, how? If you never see each other, talk to each other, or do something to fix the situation, how are you gonna figure it out? She kind of has a point. Hi. Oh, hey. How was work? Ah... nothing I love more than 20 tourists showing up ten minutes before we close and being rude to my staff. Hope you explained to them that's not how we do things in New York. I wish it was that simple. I was trying to get some work done in the office, and I had to stop that to go help wait tables... It was a whole thing. I was hoping to get out of there on the earlier side tonight. I'm sorry you didn't. Mm. So... what are you still doing up? I just wanted to talk to you. Okay. Like, uh... talk? Or... "talk" talk? I was hoping that we could talk, so that we can avoid having to "talk" talk. I miss you. I miss us. Yeah. I miss you, too. And I was just thinking about that. I was thinking that we needed a date. You know, maybe take the morning off... Mm-hmm. This is more than just a date. What we need is our honeymoon. Honeymoon? Yeah. You know, my nonna was just threatening to kick me out of the family for that exact issue. What? Apparently, I am not living up to the standard set by Serchio men. Well... one could argue that perhaps the standard was set by Serchio women, but I know what you mean. I think you got a point there. Honeymoon. Okay. Where are we going? I'm so glad you asked. You are gonna just close your eyes and spin. - Really? - Seriously! That is so not like us. I know. It's gonna be amazing. All right. Keep your eyes closed. Ooh, Japan! Oh! That would be so amazing. And I've been working with a Japanese firm that could totally help... Right. No work on our honeymoon. Japan is out. Your turn, spin. Brazil! Ooh. Remember my ex-fiancée that went to Rio to open two different restaurants? Your turn again. Uh... oh! Know anyone in Greece? No. You? No. Looks like the island of Rhodes. Well, I'll start looking up places for us to stay. What if... what if we just booked our first night... And? And then we just play the rest of it by ear? Wing it? Yeah, just wing it. That is so not like us. I know. What the heck? Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Wow! This is beautiful. Too tired to focus my eyes. I'll look later. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Hi. Welcome to Kallithea. How may I help you? Well, we had a reservation last night, under Serchio. Ah. Mr. and Mrs. Serchio... yes! Oh, we wondered what happened to you. Ah, well, our, uh, plane got delayed. Mm-hmm. Yes. So, I know we had a reservation for last night, but we didn't have a plan for the second night, so... We were wondering if you had any vacancies for tonight? It's our honeymoon. Oh! Honeymoon! Congratulations! Newlyweds. How wonderful for you. Well, we're not exactly n... So, um... can we check in early? I'm afraid not. Okay, well, I guess we can wait... Yeah. No, I mean, you cannot check in at all. We're completely booked up. Completely? Like how completely? Completely. I'm sorry. Well, do you have a recommendation for another place? Yes, I could, but I doubt they would have anything either. There's a very big football tournament being held in Rhodes. I believe you in America call it soccer, right? Yes, well... for the next few days, I'm afraid you're not going to find any hotels in the entire city of Rhodes. I'm sorry. Well, so much for winging it. I guess we could go back to the airport. Oh, no, if that means getting on an airplane again today, preemptively, no. Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just overheard you inside. My name is Penelope. Everyone calls me "Pen". Excuse me. Hi, Pen. I, um, run a delivery boat between islands. I'm going down to Lindos... A tiny town in the south. Also, the most romantic places in all of Greece! There's a beautiful old inn there, being fixed up by a brother and sister. I heard your problem, so I texted them, and there's a room available. I would be happy to give you a lift. They are very good hosts. When things seem too good to be true, they usually are. Yeah, sorry, we're a little skeptical, you know, being from New York and all. I'm just too tired to deal with a shakedown in the middle of the Aegean Sea. I'm sorry, Pen. I make you a deal. Since I'm going there anyway, you don't have to pay for the ride. Think of it as a wedding gift. - Hey, Pen! - Hey, Leo. Why aren't you in school? Half-day. For everyone, or just for you? So how far is this place? Not that far. Just on the other side of the town. Wait. Please... please tell me there's a taxi stand somewhere nearby. Oh, no cars allowed. What do you mean, no cars? How do we get there? Hello! You must be Nick and Tracy. You're Tessa? Yes! If I'd known you had arrived at the harbor, I'd have picked you up in a cart. Wait, wait, wait... you have carts? Sure. Never mind, you're here now. So, welcome to Casita Casita. This way, please. Oh! Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Nice to meet you. Please. Come! Well, I'm afraid we do have a late check-out in our honeymoon suite, but you are more than welcome to use one of the other rooms to rest, then we can move you later. Is that okay for you? Oh, yes, yes. Tessa, you could give me a pillow, and I would fall asleep right here. I think I'd do all right with just a flat rock. Well, I'm sure we can do better than a rock. Oh, I have to go. Okay, room four. Here. Up the stairs on the left. Sorry. Okay, well, we're almost there. So close. Ah, it's so beautiful. Yeah, it is. I'm just glad the veil made it safely, and I'm gonna air it out. So... what do you want to do first? Hi. What's your name, please? I'm Tracy. My name is Leo. Short for Leonidas. Leonidas? Like the runner? Yes! I'm a runner, too. Many Americans don't know about Leonidas. Well, I'm a history buff. What is a "buff"? A buff is a person who... likes something or studies something more than other people. Well, I'm an art buff, and I'm drawing a picture of you. How much? You know what really matters? Is that you have a picture to take with you, to remind you of Lindos. Uh-huh. How much? Tracy... Tracy. Can you really put a price on memories? Well, you can, if you want me to pay for it. Five Euros? Can I see it? Yes. Wow! That's really good. Ah, there you are! I want you to meet somebody. This is Xander. This is Tessa's brother... He's the chef here. This is my wife, Tracy. - Nice to meet you. - And you. Leo, I asked you not to bother the guests. Don't eat here. Save yourselves! Kids. Tessa! They want some lunch. How is my s tifatho coming? Oh, it's... coming. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Okay. I'll come with the luggage to the honeymoon suite and after, we'll serve together. Okay. It's nice, right? It is. Mm. Quiet. No sirens, no people screaming at each other. How are we gonna get to sleep? Okay. Lunch is served. It looks good. Uh-huh. Uh, this is Xander's special s tifatho. It's a Greek stew. Uh, enjoy. Is it always so quiet here? Well, it won't be soon. I have two more guests arriving late tomorrow from England. I think this is the first time we've ever had three rooms booked. It's so exciting. That's wonderful. Well? What do you think? This is, um... really, mm... Interesting? - Mm. - I'm so glad you like it! Nick, I noticed your last name. Are you Italian? Bravo. Then tomorrow, I will cook some Italian pasta in your honor. Okay, go. I'll go get you some water. Thank you! Thank you so much. What was that? Oh... my eyes are watering. Xander's food is awful. I couldn't even swallow it. My mouth actually just refused. I feel bad for Tessa. She must know. Mm-hmm. She just doesn't want to hurt her brother's feelings. Why didn't we get more of this baklava? Because we have to pace ourselves. We do? Is that a rule? Yeah, only when it comes to donkey rides. Oh... Nick? Yes? Can I ask you something? Anything. Can we never talk about the donkey rides again ever? Okay, pinky promise. Oh... pinky promise. Hey, Tracy! Hi! Leo? Nick, you remember Leo, right? Hi. You know what, I owe you for that picture. Yes! 10 Euros. Five Euros. Don't try to hustle me, kid. We're from New York. It's not going to work. You're from New York? I love New York. That's how I learned to speak English so good. Ahem! "In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups..." Very nice, very nice, very nice. That was really good. Wow! I've got to go before the goblin catches me. Bye! Bye! He's a really talented kid. Yeah. Odd, but pretty cute. Nick? Nick? I knew it! I'd recognize the smell of that marinara sauce anywhere. Uh-huh, and it smells delicious. I had horrible jet lag, I couldn't sleep. So you're cooking? Oh, just a little. Tessa and Xander are really nice people, and they have been working their tails off trying to get this place up and running, and it's all gonna get torpedoed because Xander is literally the worst cook in the entire world. We're on vacation. It's our honeymoon, and you're working! Mm-hmm. This is Xander's sauce. Try it. Nick. Try it. - Oh, that was so gross. - I got you, I got you. Okay, so what's your plan? You're just gonna replace his sauce with yours? That is exactly the plan. We had a deal, Nick. It's just a little marinara sauce. It's not like I'm managing an entire kitchen. Here. I woke up alone, in the middle of the night, on our honeymoon. For me, it feels like you're still working. Goodnight. Okay, but that's kind of sweet. No, it is sweet. I understand that I'm the bad guy in this story. It's just, well, we promised each other we wouldn't work on our honeymoon, and we didn't even last a day. And you haven't answered any texts from Stanley? That's different. Tracy, how is it different? I don't know! It's just... It's different. Well, I for one, am very jealous about your trip. Oh! Me too. Except for the donkey part. That was sort of fun, though. All right, here. You have to check out this place. Isn't it gorgeous? Oh, speaking of gorgeous... Hello, ladies! Hello! I'm gonna leave you two honeymooners alone now. Bye. Have fun, you two! Bye. So, you forgive me for abandoning you last night? Of course, I do. I understand. You do? Yeah, I do. Thanks. What are you reading? Your mind. Ooh! Kalimera! Lady Dalton and Mr. Dalton, I'm Alexandros, but you can call me Xander. - Call me Colin, please. - Let me help you with those. Grandma? I'm sorry my sister, Tessa, isn't here to greet you, but she had to run into town. I'm sure we'll catch up later. Okay. Colin, we have you upstairs in room number four, and Lady Dalton, you are right next to Colin in room number five. - Perfect. - Lady Dalton, do you have trouble with the stairs? Because we can accommodate you downstairs, if needed. Don't be absurd, young man. We have a couple from New York staying, too. Nick and Tracy. You'll get to meet them at dinner. Do they have trouble with the stairs? We look forward to meeting them. Hey. Aw. Last one to the bar buys the margaritas. What? Wait! Hold on! Wait for me! Hey, Leo. Hi. Hey, Tracy. Hi. So, um, what are you working on? Nothing. Do you know that I went to college and studied art history? It's what I do now, for a living. You draw? Well, not nearly as well as you do. But do you know what I can do? What? I can tell when someone's work really comes from their heart. There's an honesty to it. It's something you can't fake. It means the difference between a good piece and a great one. I'll see you later, Leo. See you, Tracy. Thank you! Hey there! Everyone's meeting down at the bar for a drink. All right, I'll be right down. Oh... wow. Room with a view. Oh, it's incredible, isn't it? And the fragrance... I just love the smell of the sea air. Mm-hmm. Can you believe we finally made it? Mm. What's that? Oh. It's a sketch that Leo did for me. Oh. And he just gave it to you? For free? Kid's got some talent. And there's a story there, too. Something going on with him he doesn't want everyone to see. That's a shame. He's way too young for that. No kid should have to hide who they really are. You're a good man, Nick Serchio. Mm. Don't believe everything you hear. Nick? What's wrong? Nick, where's the veil? I know I left it in the closet of room four when we were in there. Xander probably forgot to take it when he transferred our rooms. I'm sure that's what happened, but let me just figure this out... - Oh! Ahh! - Whoa! Sorry, sorry. No, it's my fault. Uh... you must be Mr. Dalton? It's Colin. Ah, Mr. Colin. No, just... just "Colin". Ah. Oh, Colin. Yes. Uh, I'm Tessa. Oh. Um... Sorry, I found this wedding veil in my wardrobe. Does... Does it belong to anyone? Yes! Uh... it belongs to Nick and Tracy. - That'd be us. - That's us. - Oh, sorry. - Yeah. Thank you so much. Pleasure to meet you guys. So, uh... who's getting married? It's actually quite a story. Want to hear it? This sauce is exceptional. Mm! My compliments to the chef. Tessa... Xander, why don't you sit and eat with us? Yes, please. Join us? Uh, sure. You were saying there's a story regarding your veil? The lace work is extraordinary! Thank you, yes. It's from the 1800s... From the House of Stefano in Burano, Italy. Oh, and you have it with you because you're on your honeymoon? Actually, we've been married for three years. Yeah, but we are on our honeymoon... it's just a little delayed. My dear boy, that's not a delay... That's criminal neglect! I'm surprised you're still married. Why are you traveling with the veil, then? Oh, we're taking it to my sister Monica in Spain. - So she's getting married? - No. She's not even dating anyone. And I'll let Tracy take it from here. Okay. My two best friends and I were antiquing and this shop owner told us that the veil has a legend, that whoever is in possession of the veil will find true love. So, of course, the three of us had to buy it together. And were you all engaged at that time? Not even close. How fun! So, did the legend come to pass? Well, my friends would say yes, but I'm... Skeptical? Skeptical. Exactly. Although, all three of you did meet your husbands while you were holding the veil. - Really? - Mm-hmm. And actually, my friend's mother-in-law and my other friend's assistant. So, my sister, Monica, is very, um... She's spicy. Yeah, uh, "spicy marinara". So, my family thought it'd be a good idea to give her a little gentle nudge. And if the magic of the veil works again? If the veil works for a sixth time... then even I will have to believe in it. Aw... I love romantic stories! Well... here's to romance! Romance. Morning! Morning. Morning? Morning? - Hmm! - Oh! Uh... that's a lovely shade. Does it match my eyes? Uh, I'm so sorry. No, no, it's-it's completely my fault. I-I shouldn't have startled you. No, no. I'm gonna get you a rag. Actually... It's quite a nice effect. It definitely improves the shirt. No, you're just being kind. I'm not. And look, you know, seeing as I've already been consecrated in, um... some shade of blue I can't read... "Mediterranean blue." Yes. Do you, um, have an extra brush? Ah. But... But you're our guest. A guest who's on London time. I-I've been up for hours. Sure. Um... which one do you pick? Uh... that one. Okay, like this? Yeah, I like this one. It's good. Ah, I could get used to swimming every day. Well, you could always go swimming in the Hudson at home. Yeah, if you want me to start glowing. Nick, where's the veil? - Hi! - Hi... Can we look in your closet, please? Okay. This is weird. Isn't it? Uh, is everything okay? Yes, it is now. My veil migrated back to Colin's closet. What? Please understand... I'm just as confused about all this as you are. I've been with Tessa all morning. Painting. It's true! So you're not an international veil thief? I stick to jewelry, mainly. The occasional sports car. I love mysteries. "Who did it?" Not me. Look, the veil didn't just get up and walk away. Hi! Hello. Will you have dinner with us tonight? No. - We're just... - We're going for... into town... - Town, uh... - for dinner. - Dinner. But stay tomorrow, because I'm making pastitsio... It's like Greek lasagna. I'm starting it tonight. It's better if it has time to sit. Ah. Is pastitsio hard to make? Not if you know how to cook. I found a book of Greek letters for Daniel. Okay. And then, look at this cute little outfit I found for... oh! Arianna. So cute, right? And then I got this... art supplies for Leo. Leo? Isn't it weird to buy a kid you don't know a gift? Well, you've seen his pencil... It's like an inch long! And he's drawing on envelopes. I got a hypothetical question for you here. Let's just say some stranger bought your child a gift... Would you feel uneasy? Well, my child would not be selling their drawings for five Euros on the dock. I'm just trying to help him with that. Yeah. Do you hear that? I don't hear anything. Exactly. How long do you think it'll take us to get used to all this quiet around here? Well, I could use a good car alarm right about now. Leo! Oh, Leo, hey. I'm so glad you're here. Hi, Tracy and Nick. I'm sorry, I've got to go. Well, I just... I have something for you. Here. Thank you, but... no, I can't. Oh, it's from me to you. Tracy, I... Please, please, consider it payment for the drawing that you made me. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I've got to go! Bye! Bye. I just made a huge mistake, didn't I? Hello, Leo. And what do we have here? Nick? Nick? Really? Mm. Um, yeah. I-I hadn't made pastitsio in a while, and, um, I thought I'd jump in. Wait, you're replacing his entire dish now? Ooh, trust me... It was not salvageable. Do you mind grating a little cheese for me? Uh, forgive the intrusion. I was looking for... never mind. Oh! Oh, you're, uh... making pastitsio? - I am. - Huh. Ahh! This is all making sense now. What is? I couldn't quite figure out how last night's marinara came from the same kitchen as tonight's moussaka. I take it the, uh, marinara was yours? Guilty. Shh. He owns two very successful restaurants in New York City. Oh, really? Well, very good. Well done, you. Well, I shall, uh... leave you to it and I look forward to tasting it. Toodle-pip! Is this enough cheese? Aw, come on, what kind of question is that? Is there ever enough cheese? Good point. Oh, here, let me, uh... lend you a little assistance. Mm-hmm. Ah, you look so beautiful when you cook. Morning! Morning. I'm, uh, heading into town. Yeah, I thought I might do a bit of shopping. Okay. Have a good day. I have a question. Yes? Haggling... Uh, yes or no? Oh, uh, no. I mean, in Greece, the price is always the price. Oh, good. I'm terrible at it. Uh, I... actually have a little bit of time, if you need an interpreter. Yes! Yes! I would really appreciate that. Okay, I'll go change. I said no work, Stanley. Because I'm on my honeymoon! No! No. No. Wait... and no! Goodbye, Stanley. Nick and I promised each other we wouldn't work on our honeymoon, but my colleague is very determined. What do you do, my dear? I work at an auction house that's affiliated with the Met. I think you do more than just work in it. You're in charge, aren't you? That's why they call you on your honeymoon. Yeah. I guess I am. Don't undersell yourself, my dear. We need to be proud of what we accomplish, no? And proud of each other as well. Thank you. This way, please. Mm! Is that Ouzo I smell? Good nose. Ah... thank you! Mm. Aw, did I wake you up? Yeah. Well... I have a theory. You want to hear it? - Of course. - Okay. So I saw Tessa and Colin in town and they were very friendly. Well, they are very friendly people. No, I mean friendly with a capital "F". Ooh, capital-"F" friendly? - So... - Hmm. Who has keys to Colin's room and to our room? Tessa! And if she likes Colin, maybe she thinks the veil will exert its power? I like where you're going with this. - Mm-hmm, right? - All right. Hello. I am Headmaster Papadopoulos, and I run the boys' academy here in town. - Oh! Hello. - Hi. - Nick. Nice to... - I'll get right to the point. Please do not give my students presents. Do you mean the art set that I got for... Leo was nearly expelled because I was certain he stole that art set. Well, I'm sorry, but that seems like your mistake, not Leo's. Ma'am. With all due respect, if you want to help my students, we have a proper way to make donations. If you can't do that, please leave my boys alone. Is that clear? Ahem. Yeah, that's perfectly clear. Now let me be clear. Please don't ever use that tone of voice with my wife again, okay? Have a nice day. You tried to warn me, and I didn't listen, I'm sorry. Ah, it's okay. It's not okay! What if I had gotten Leo expelled? Oh, come on. Do you really think a kid that parkours himself through the window every night just as the bell rings isn't in trouble on the regular? You did get all "Mr. Tough Guy" on that headmaster. Hey, he deserved it, eh? It started to make my knees a little weak. It's a good thing I'm here to catch you. My hero. Mm. I just feel terrible that I got Leo in trouble. I think it's sweet that you're worried about him. Just like a Mama Bear! Okay, let's not get carried away here. In the "plus" column, Nick's pastitsio was delicious last night. I thought you two were on your honeymoon. Why is he cooking? Yeah! What happened to you two not working? We decided that it doesn't count as work. Yeah, right. Wh... Daniel, no-no... whoa! I gotta go. Love you guys, bye! Me too. Check out my channel, my new video's up! I will! Love you. Mwah! I know her! That's "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian". Yeah! Yeah, that's one of my best friends. Really? Tell her, please, thank you from me. I'm learning about art from her videos. Aw, she'll love to hear that. But you're also learning art in school, right? "There is no money in art, Leo. "You're wasting your time, Leo! Do more maths, Leo!" Well, I'm really sorry that I got you in trouble with your headmaster. I'm always in trouble with my headmaster. I know! You should ask your friend to do a video at our school. We have a, you know, a jug... Like an urn... With a drawing on it, from long ago, and we think maybe it's Leonidas. The first one, not me. Your friend could do a video about that, and people would want to watch it, and they'd give money to the school, and Headmaster Papadopoulos would like me more. That is a great idea, and I'm sure Emma would love to do it, but she has a little girl and she lives in Italy, and I just don't know that that would work out. But you could ask... couldn't you? Please? Oh! Hi. Hi. Does the wedding veil have other skills besides finding love... Teleportation, perhaps? - Thank you. - Pleasure. So, I read about this hike up to this monastery... It's about a four-hour round trip. You interested? No, but that works out with my plans for the morning perfectly. Oh, are you going sleuthing? Hmm? "The case of the transporting veil"? Exactly! I'd be happy to be the Watson to your Sherlock. Oh. The Danno to my McGarrett? Nice! Yeah. The Nick to your Nora. I see what you did there. Well, good morning, everyone. Good morning! Hi. There's coffee, if you'd like. Oh, no, thank you. We're heading out on a hike today. Yup. Yeah. Big, old hike... Gone for a couple of hours. Mm-hmm. Yep, we'll be gone for a while. So, see you later. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Think they bought it? - Oh, yeah, totally. - Yeah. - Mm. - Mwah. - Have a good hike. - Okay. Love you. Ah, well... I think I might go back upstairs and have a nice little nap. Okay. Aye-yi-yi! - Tessa! Oh. What are you doing here? Oh! Where am I? I'm so confused. Oh! Am I sleepwalking? Okay. I might have bought that if I hadn't seen you pick that lock like a pro. Oh. I think maybe we should have a little chat. Oh, it's beautiful here, isn't it? It was my grandson's idea to come here. His parents aren't much for traveling, but... oh, Colin and I have had such wonderful adventures since I retired. Retired from what? Oh, you know... British government. "Home Office". Picking locks? Well, there was a time when the wars were cold, and people with certain skills and temperaments were useful. Well, may I say thank you for your service? Well, one does what one can with what one has. Okay. So why were you trying to steal my veil? Colin is ready to settle down and Tessa is exactly the kind of girl I would have chosen for him. And if I'm being honest... since I intend to play with my great-grandbabies, I'd rather he fell in love with someone in a warm climate. So you believe in the veil? Oh, my dear! I've lived a long time and seen many things. Believing in the veil doesn't even break a sweat. Well, the legend does say whoever is "in possession of the veil..." And Colin was definitely in possession of the veil when he first met Tessa. Well, okay then. Your work here is done, 007. You don't need to keep breaking into my room. Old habits die hard! - Ouzo? - Ouzo. - Cheers. Mm-hmm. - Thank you. You know what I was thinking today up at the monastery? I hope it's not that you want to become a monk? No! Emphatically, no. Um, I was thinking I really miss cooking. What do you mean? You spend all day and all night at those restaurants. I know... but I don't do any cooking anymore. I'm just dealing with vendors and shipping and refrigeration and more vendors. I mean, don't get me wrong... I love what I do. But I just really miss, you know, just cooking for the customers and... and for you. Well, how do we make that happen? I don't know... but I want to figure it out. We're gonna figure it out. - Okay. - Just the two of us. - Yeah. - Surprise! Emma? How are you here? I know I'm crashing your honeymoon, which is maybe the tackiest thing ever... but you texted me about that Grecian urn, and I'm only two hours away, so... I can't believe you came! What... What Grecian urn? Oh, apparently, they found one at Leo's school. The school with the headmaster who yelled at you? - Exactly. - Who yelled at you? Avery! Hi! I couldn't let her crash your honeymoon without me! Of course not! I really like Leo. He's talented and funny, and sweet, and he always has a side hustle going. You seem really taken with this kid. Oh. Well, I showed you his work, right? He's really good! And I just want to help him, if I can, that's all. But that means facing the dreaded headmaster? - Yeah. - Yeah. Exactly. All right. Break time's over. Let's go, ladies. All right. Back to it. I called and the school secretary told me he brings the kids up here once every month, and today is that day. Wow... Yeah. Wow. Can you believe we're actually up here? It's like we're standing in the middle of history. It's just unreal. It's amazing that these places are still here, you know, centuries later. It's undeniably... selfie time. Yes! Here, let me take it. No, honey, get in. We crashed your honeymoon... The least you can do is crash our selfie. - Yeah. - Okay, fine. And he's got longer arms, it's gonna be great. Everyone say... "Acropolis!" Acropolis! - Aw, so great. - Wait. That's him! Over this way. Come on! Wait, wait, wait. What're you gonna say to him? I don't know. I'll think of something on the way. Come on! Great. More steps. Mr. Papadopoulos? Hi. Excuse me. Sorry. Um, do you remember me? I-I wondered if you have a moment to talk? And these videos are successful? They are. In fact, some of the places I've visited even started charging a small entrance fee, so... it's been beneficial to their budgets as well. Did Leo put you up to this? Not exactly. But he did ask to be in the video. Of course, he has. And knowing Leo, I'm sure he also requested a fee for his services? Just a small one. But we would need permission from his parents in order to allow it. You don't know, then? Know what? He lives at the school full-time. Leo has no family. I didn't know. That's why I asked you not to encourage his art. The boys who live at our school don't need to study art. They need marketable skills... Such engineering or a trade... So they can work as soon as they leave school. Running and art are lovely hobbies, but neither will support him when he grows up. Well, with all due respect, sir... We all went to art school and now we work in that industry. Quite successfully. Yes... but you all likely had safety nets, didn't you? Someone to help, if you needed it? Um... we did, yes. Leo has no one. If he doesn't learn a skill now, he'll still be drawing pictures for tourists down on the docks when he's 40. Surely, you must see I want more for him. Yes, I do see that. What is he saving up for? He has an uncle in Athens. Not a real uncle... A man who used to live in the downstairs unit, and this man would watch Leo when his mother worked. It was one of those families people make when they need to. What happened? The uncle got forgetful and went to a memory facility, and then his mother passed, which is how Leo ended up here. The boy mails a drawing to his uncle every week, so some money goes to postage. And the rest, he is saving to go and visit him. Well, is there someone who could take him? I mean, it's only a day trip. The uncle is not even likely to even remember Leo. I'm sorry, Mr. Papadopoulos. I can see that you want what's best for him. I just want to help. So do I. And I don't want to break that boy's heart any more than it's already been broken. Good day. Nick! Hey. Xander. Is everything okay? Oh, yes. Sure. Fine. Heh. You? - Great. - Good. Yes. Okay. I'm... I'm gonna go to the bar. Okay. I forgot the cinnamon! On the pastitsio... I realized I forgot to add cinnamon. Critical, right? But I forget! But when I looked, the cinnamon was in there. So... maybe I have one of those elves that come in the night to fix the shoes, except, for me, they fix the food. Xander... Then I looked you up on the Internet, Nick, and I know what happened to my food... Why it got so good! All right, look, I didn't mean to interfere. I'm really sorry that I upset you... No, I'm not upset. Nick, I'm terrified! I'm making seafood for eight people tonight, and I don't want to poison us all! Help me. Okay. Okay. Ohh... Oh... Oh! Look at what I got for Daniel. I wonder what it says. "Greetings from Greece." I didn't know you could read Greek. I can't. I can read T-shirts. Trace, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about Leo. Oh, thanks. You were just trying to do the right thing, you know? It's not your fault that the headmaster doesn't agree. I know, I know. I just wish that there was something I could... Hello? Yes. Really? Thank you! Thank y... thank you so much, Mr. Papadopoulos. Thank you! I don't know what made him change his mind, but he did, and ladies, we are making a video! Come on! Leonidas won all three of his foot races, in four separate Olympic Games. The island of Rhodes has changed a lot since his day, but I think, if you listen closely, you can hear the next Leonidas of Rhodes training for his shot at Olympic glory. Hey! Yay! Whoo! - Was that good? - Put it there, buddy. Dinner is served! - Wow! - Ooh! Oh, thank you. Hey! Leo! Where are you going? It's your dinnertime. I should leave you alone. Yeah, don't worry... Nick cooked. Come on! Get over here. Yeah. There you go. They'll make you do the dishes, though. Trace? Tracy? So... you were right. Waking up alone is no fun. Zero stars. Do not recommend. I thought I was gonna just come down and make a PB and J, but Xander's homemade peanut butter's gone bad or something. Mm, well, that's because this is tahini. Yeah, and your, uh... and your "jelly" is fish eggs. Ugh. Ah, and that's why I don't cook. Mm. My friends just showed up here, crashing our honeymoon, and you handled it like a champ. You are seriously the best husband in the world. Mm. Wait. I-I'm sorry... What was that last part? Oh, yeah. No. You just get it the one time. Yeah. I know how it is with the three of you... And they were here before me, so... Oh, what is that? Oh, uh, it's just a sketch that Leo made me. - Wow! - Yeah. "Wow." He's a talented kid. Mm-hmm. You, know, I've never seen you so taken with a child before. Usually, you keep them at arms' length. Oh, sweetheart. Hey, hey, hey! There's no crying on honeymoons. That's baseball. Okay, whatever it is... come on, talk to me. What's going on? I just want to help him, you know? And... I get it, he has his own life. I get that it's none of our business, and that it's totally not me, but... but still... You want to go take him to see his uncle, don't you? The one who doesn't remember him? Okay, even if that's what happens, maybe that would help Leo, maybe he could just finally move on, you know? You remember when I said that art kit was a bad idea? I feel like this is kinda like that. This is his gift. It's all he has... and he shared it with me. And it's beautiful. What am I supposed to do, just leave? "Well, thanks, kid! Good luck with your life!" It just doesn't feel right to me. Well, you have to get permission from the headmaster. That seems highly unlikely. I know. I just have to try. Good morning! Oh, good morning, Lady Dalton. Uh... this came for you. Ah! Excellent. Thank you. I told Xander I'd go into town to pick up some supplies for dinner tonight. What are you doing today, Nan? First, I plan to finish my book. Then I'm going to man the desk for Tessa here, so that she can go into town and have a nice lunch. Oh... And you are going to escort her. You can do your shopping on the way back. And I am not entertaining any questions on this topic. Thank you. Hey, Leo. Hi! Want to go for a jog with me? - Yeah. - All right, let's do it. I'll go slow so you can keep up. I've got a cramp. Ho, ho. Oh! You know, the shameful part is, I know you're holding back. Don't be ashamed, Nick. You run really fast... for an old man. Who you calling old man, spring chicken? Sit down. Was your mom a runner? Yeah. She ran all the way through school. That's why she named me Leonidas. My uncle says he ran, too. Yeah? He liked the, uh... the, uh, little jumps. The little jumps? Oh, the hurdles? Yes! "Hurdles". Nice. That's the uncle you want to go see? He doesn't remember things anymore. I know you want to go see him, but, people, when they lose their memory, sometimes, they don't recognize... I know. He might not remember me anymore. Are you sure you're prepared for that? I am. Because... if he doesn't remember me, that's okay. I remember him, and he gets a visit from a nice stranger. Come on, Nick, we've got a kilometer and a half to go. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. My shoelace is untied. - Oh... - Yeah. I still can't believe we crashed your honeymoon. Are you kidding? I can. Totally on-brand! Oh, and we're gonna have to come back for the wedding if the legend of the veil continues. Oh, Avery! Hey, um, I meant to ask you, is Peter still involved in children's art programs? Sure. Are you thinking about for Leo? I am. I was hoping maybe we could find him a better school... One that's right for him. Maybe something in Athens? And Nick and I could help with the costs. I'll definitely ask Peter to look around, but have you talked to Nick about this? Not yet. Well, don't you think you should? It's kind of a couple's decision... Not really something you do on your own, right? I'm just working up the nerve, okay, Emma? Excuse me, ladies, but we really must get going. Of course, yes. Oh, thank you so much. Here. Oh! Thank you. Thanks. The long goodbye! I hate this part. Mwah, mwah! So, when do you want to go? Where? To go talk to Leo's headmaster about visiting his uncle. How did you know? I know my wife. I am pleased with the video. We have already had a number of inquiries. Oh, good. I'm thrilled. I will be sure to let my friend know. And now I believe you want something else from me? Yes. The uncle? The uncle. Sir, my wife has about a hundred reasons why this would be a good idea, and she would happily pitch 'em all to you. But at the end of the day, what's most important is, would this trip be helpful to Leo? Every week, for two years now, Leo sends this uncle a picture. He never replies. - He might not even still... - Excuse me. But I think this trip is about Leo's heart... it's not about the uncle's memory. Yes. I see. Okay. Yes, you may take him to Athens to see his uncle. Thank you so much, Mr. Papadopoulos. I fear it won't go as you hope. Well, I hope it won't go as you fear. Yes! So when can we go? Leo! What did we discuss about eavesdropping? I'm sorry, Mr. Papadopoulos. So when can we go? Honey! We told Pen we would meet her and Leo at the dock at 10:00! Come on! Yeah. I'm coming, I'm coming. Good luck in Athens. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, look at you... Doing a little gardening. Oh, uh, yeah, well, you know, it needed doing, so. Uh-huh. - Nick, come on! - Ah, okay, okay! Just hope there's not any donkeys out there. Donkeys? Hi. Oh, hey. Want to have a break? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Thank you. You know, I'm so focused on fixing the inside, I totally forget about the outside. We could... take up some of old shrubs from around the back and-and plant some new fruit trees. "We"? Sorry, no, I... I meant you. Of course. Although, I was thinking... your WiFi here is really good... so I could work, and Nan loves it here, too. So... maybe we could... could stay on for a while? Are you going to break my heart? No. I don't do that. Would it... be all right if I... It's just right over here, I think. There it is! Wait. What if he doesn't remember? Whatever happens, we will be there with you, no matter what, okay? Come here. Uncle Orion? Do you remember me? I forget so much... these days. So much. But I will always remember... my little Leo. Come here, boy. Come here! Let's get outta here. How you doing? Fine. - For real? - For real. Liar. Okay, well, here's the thing. I, um... I spoke to Peter about trying to find a more art-centric secondary school for Leo in Athens. Wow, that's really not like you, Trace. I know. I know. So, Peter has been checking everywhere and there is a residential school with a strong art program in Athens, but it's wait-listed for two years. Okay, well, that's better than nothing, I guess. I mean, we can get him on the list now, right? But they have very little in the way of athletics and their test scores are much lower than where he is now. Oh! Why did I think this would be easy? Wait. What aren't you telling me? She has the worst poker face. You'd think she'd get better at it over the years. I'm right here, I can hear you. Tell me, Avery. Okay, fine. Peter wanted me to mention he did find a school that fit the bill. It's grade 7 through 12, focuses on art, has a strong sports program, including track, and has a residential program for international students. - That sounds perfect! - Yeah. It's very expensive, though. How much? Numbers that make me nervous. And where is it? Okay, this is the funny part. Why? It's in New York City. It's about 12 blocks from your house. You know what? I gotta run. I gotta pick up Daniel from daycare, but I'm gonna email you all the info. Thank you. Seriously, Avery, thank you so much. Love you. Bye. Love you both. How expensive? Numbers that make Avery nervous. Hmm! But we could save money... if we let Leo live with us. Maybe? Trace, uh... we've been dancing around this topic the entire time we've been here. We don't even see each other. We just don't have time, and now you want to add a kid into the mix? You're right. It's time to stop dancing and... leave Leo out of the equation. Nick, sometimes, I feel like I'm married to a bunch of cute Post-it notes and delicious leftovers. Yeah, I get it. So we have to fix it. I want to. Do you have any ideas? Well, there are two of us in this marriage... So, either we figure this out together, - or... - Or...? We won't figure it out at all. May I? Oh, please, join me. Tracy. I have held onto this box for a very long time. Some of its contents are mine, some belonged to my parents... even my grandparents. What's inside? Letters. And I am ready to send them to auction... because I have finally found someone I can trust. Why me? There are several reasons, but mostly because I've seen you with your friends. I had a friendship like that once. So I know, that to keep that kind of friendship for that long... that is someone you can trust. I'm honored, Lady Dalton. With the proceeds of these letters, I am setting up a scholarship for Leo to attend whichever school you and your husband think best. Lady Dalton, that is so kind of you, but you can't think that... The advantage of being me is I can do whatever I want. Now, that boy will do spectacular things one day, as long as he has people in his life like you and Nick to guide him. With the rest of this, I intend to buy a little cottage up the road, so I can live here when Colin and Tessa get married. Oh, nothing large... just five or six bedrooms, maybe? It sounds like you're expecting those letters to bring quite a lot. Who are they from? Oh, just some names that may well be familiar to you. Spencer... Windsor... Mountbatten... Churchill. Winston Churchill? Your tea's getting cold, dear. Excuse me... is this sunset taken? Please. So, I talked to my sister, Monica, last night about a couple things. One, she offered her opinion about my successes as a husband. And two... I offered her the position of business manager at the restaurant. Now she'll get to yell at people and get paid for it, instead of her doing it for free. Well, you know what they say... You do what you love, you don't work a day in your life. Yeah. As far as Leo is concerned, I just never thought that I'd be making cannolis for a bake sale or taking a kid and his friends to the Jets' games or having somebody live with us. It's just not who I thought we were. Okay. Then we won't do it. - Just like that? - Just like that. And I do really want to help Leo... but we don't have to be involved in his life, if that's not what you want. You know, the thing is, the more I think about it, the more I realize... that is what I want. You know, I-I know that it's not us... Maybe it is us? Maybe it is! I love you. Good, 'cause you're stuck with me forever. Can you believe this view? It's beautiful. With your permission, we would like to present these options to Leo, and let him decide for himself. Art and running? Yeah. And when he's done with school, then what? Well... Enough of this foolishness. I know you think you're saving him. You're not. Go home. Leave him and me alone. Leo. Leo! Wait! Mr. Papadopoulos, what do you do for fun? Or to relax? Well, uh... I read a lot. Mysteries, mostly. And I go to the cinema and museums. And I sing at the church choir. Those are all very beautiful forms of art. Someone wrote that book. Someone... filmed that movie, painted that masterpiece... and composed the music that you sing. What would your life be like without art? Could you even last a week? Especially when times are tough. You and I have one thing in common... We both turn to the arts for comfort. I can't predict the future... but I do know one thing. Leo will either grow up to be an artist... or he will grow up frustrated and regretful that he never even got the chance. Hey. Mind if I sit down? If I go to school in New York... could I live with you and Tracy? Yeah, if you want. And when I run in the Olympics, could I still represent Greece? Of course! You're Greek. Nothing can change that. Could I still write to my uncle every week? Absolutely. You could even come visit him, if you want. And could you add some Greek food to your fusion restaurants? Ooh... I don't know about that. I mean, we could ask Xander for some recipes... No! What if Headmaster Papadopoulos won't let me go? Oh... I don't know, Leo. I just don't know. Come here. Did you check under the bed? Yeah, twice. Did you check the dresser? Twice. You know, I can't believe Papadopoulos didn't even contact us. Yeah. Want me to head down to the school and lean on him a little? No, but thank you for offering. Mm. Where is Xander? So, are you still taking the veil to Spain? Oh! No, actually. We're gonna give it to Nick's sister, Monica, when she joins us in New York next week. Oh. Oh, Lady Dalton, it's been such a pleasure getting to know you. For me, too. Mrs. Serchio? I have a young man here who would like to talk to you... about art. There will be several kilometers of red tape to get through, to make this happen. Do we look like the kind of people that are afraid of a little red tape? Thank you very much. Hurray! I can't believe we're back in Greece so soon. Not that I'm complaining. Isn't Tessa a stunning bride? In a beautiful veil. And the earrings from Arianna's portrait look great with your dress. Thank you! I think they look great with everything. You look beautiful. Tracy? Lady Dalton told me that you said if the veil worked for a sixth time, that you would finally believe in it. It's actually seven times. Oh, that's right! Nick's sister's finally found love. Is the wedding gonna be in New York? It is. Next month. Do you want to crash it? Uh, absolutely, we do! I mean, that's what we do. Hey, Mom! Pen has a new boat and she says that she can take me out in it tomorrow. Is that okay? Sure. Ah! Yes! Thank you! Tracy... did Leo just call you "Mom"? Yeah, he does that sometimes. I'm... I'm just letting him decide who I am to him. I think that's beautiful. - You do? - Yes. You think it's okay? I think that's very okay. Milady? Sorry to interrupt. - May I have this dance? - Always. Oh! Oh, you know what? Could we just have the bottle? Thank you. - I mean, just in case. - Just in case! Yeah, we'll just sit it right there. Give me your glass. Thank you so much for lending me the veil. And for bringing it here last year. I'm so happy for you. You're coming back down to the party, aren't you? Oh, yes, we will. We just have a tradition to see to first. Okay. See you down there. Okay. All right... I think it's time. It's time. Can you imagine how different our lives would be without the veil? I can't even think about it. Does that mean you finally believe? Avery. I believe in the veil. Oh! To the veil! Hello! Kalimera. What a beautiful hat! You seem just like the kind of fine ladies who appreciate great jewelry. Come, come. Follow me, follow me. Look... at this. Oh, that is so pretty. It looks very old. 19th century? Yes! They say 1860s, but this is a very special piece. Really? What's so special about it? Apparently, there is a legend associated with this necklace. For anyone who is in possession of it... Want to hear about it? Tell me more. When I first met Tracy, she tried to steal my alteration appointment. Because when I first met Nick, he had already stolen my appointment. What? You were 15 minutes late! In my restaurant, if you're 15 minutes late, you lose your reservation. He was 15 minutes early. What, do you seat people when they arrive early? Absolutely. Oh. Well, it doesn't matter. Well, it doesn't matter, because she just stole her appointment back. What can I say? All's fair in love and veils. Ooh, nice.
