I'll be back in seconds. Okay, I registered Majd for a summer school in Haifa. Haifa?! There was this scout who discovered Majd's talent He wants to train him at Maccabi Haifa's football team. Maccabi Haifa?! What on earth are you saying? He will be really upset if you stop him. It's only for two months. I don't agree with what you are saying Indeed, we do not have money, so the answer is no. I borrowed the money. How could you take such a decision on your own? Stop Maryam! That's enough.

I'm heading there tomorrow morning. - Where? - Hayesh, it's close-by, it's close-by Can I store these here until I sell them? Sure Abu Nidal, but what are they? I worked for this cheap guy who didn't want to pay me. He said he would pay me after selling these. I told him give them to me and I will sell them. I am sick of him and sick of working with him. - Mustafa. - Yes, Abu Nidal? - Is everything OK? - Everything's fine. If you need anything, tell me I am like your eldest brother. Appreciated Abu Nidal. You are really a loyal friend. How about we have a cup of tea and relax? The kids left. My mother will be happy to see you! No, next time! Just let me know whenever you get that permit. If you couldn't get the permit, inform me, I know a smuggler. Abu Nidal, I wouldn't... In the workshop, many workers are smuggled. That's that! - You owe me a cup of coffee! - My pleasure. ''It was set up to rescue Trump and Netanyahu'' ''to renew their terms in office'' ''Many Israeli analysts say that it is a crazy plan'' ''They said that these guys are like gamblers in a casino'' ''Trump's followers'' ''The only ones who take this plan seriously'' ''are some Arab governments For example, you see...''

Listen, I went to Tulkarm club today. I talked to the coach... I showed him some videos of Majd. The coach agreed to have him join the team. Looks like I'm talking to myself. I thought you left. I am talking to myself ''And who will drive Majd to the West Bank every day?'' - ''Or you didn't think about it?'' - I thought about it I figured he could stay here instead of going back and forth everyday. ''Perhaps you ask him first instead of taking the decision alone'' - ''Wait, what's that on your ear?'' - What? - ''What's that on your ear?'' - It's nothing. Listen, we will talk tomorrow with Majd and about him, okay? I got my permit and I'm working with Abu Nidal tomorrow I lost my key. I don't know where it is Leave a key under the pot for me if you are coming home late. Okay? Will you be back before three? ''Why are you heading to work?'' ''Your back needs rest. Why are you doing this to yourself?'' What do you want me to do? What shall I do? ''What are you talking about?'' ''Listen, OK! Go to work and break your back'' ''Let's see where your stubbornness will take us.'' ''How will you benefit? Why are you doing this to yourself?'' ''Why are you doing this to us? Why are you being silly! I'm here!'' Will you give me pocket money too? Did you add parsley? Many thanks! Greetings. Back. Enter. Go. Clean your finger and try again?

You know how the situation is Stay here tonight. - Leave it! - No. it's mine! Majd, come here! - It's my bracelet. - Dad, tell him to give it back. - It's not even for girls! - Yes, it is! You don't know anyone from Liverpool except Mo Salah. Majd, listen Come here. You're a good boy, right? Give it to me, I'll give it back to you when she calms down, OK? You're a champ! Champ - What's wrong, kid? - Nothing. What's happening? Let me see. - It's nothing. - What's wrong? Let me see. Majd! Let me see - What is this? - A fight. - What! - A fight. With whom? With whom, son? Salwa. What's happening? What is this? He had a fight with the boys at school. They started it! Their parents called and apologized. Wait. Tell me from the beginning. They started it. They call me a rotten West Banker. and they say dirty words. I hate this school. I don't want to go there. I want to leave it or I'll beat them all up! - Why didn't you tell me? - You are not here! Why didn't you do anything about this? I did I talked to his teacher who said that he would fix the problem. - He obviously fixed it! - Kids fight all the time. - Why didn't you tell me! - Tell you what, Mustafa? I don't know! You want Majd to play with Israeli kids? Imagine the situation if this fight had been with Israeli kids! The situation? I work two jobs and sleep for two hours, Mustafa. I run between checkpoints to keep up with two houses I feel all alone! And you are guilt-tripping me! If it's my fault, then take charge yourself. I can't handle it anymore. OK, get the kids and come live with me in the West Bank. Mustafa, don't tease me You know it's your fault! You had a chance to get an Israeli ID and you refused! - I don't want the ID! - Is this what you want? Living separately in two houses and this shitty wall between us! After I leave the school and my clients and return to the West Bank do you expect us to live off your permit? ''Come to success'' ''Come to success'' Salwa. I'm working part-time tomorrow. I'll finish early, maybe I'll go see the kids straight away. Get back to me and let me know if that's OK. Try again. No. Give me your card. Your card is expired. You need to renew it. My permit is valid. You can check. I can pass, and after passing I will renew it. You need to renew your card in order to enter Israel. Now, go back. What's wrong? Could you please give me back the permit? Don't you understand? You get it once you renew the card. Go back. What's happening! Unacceptable, she took my permit. - Hey! Go back! - Ok, sure! - Abu Nidal, you go ahead. - Mustafa, I will call you. - We will fix this issue. - OK, Abu Nidal. - What can I do? - Go back. They will replace me? I don't understand. Tell them what happened! I'll renew the card tomorrow. Oh, right. Tomorrow is Saturday. So, where's your guy? Alright, I will call him and see what will happen, Okay. Okay, I will let you know. Greetings. Abu Nidal sent me here he says he knows you. Come in. It's 350 shekels. We leave in 15 minutes. You will be in Israel in an hour. What is wrong? Are you coming or what? Honestly, the price is absurd but what happens if we get caught? It's a guaranteed service that is why it's expensive, got it? You have 15 minutes to think about it. I'm still speaking with you! How did you close the window? What? I asked you a question What if we get caught? Tell him what happened when you got caught last time. Mind you, he wasn't caught with me. A fine of 10,000 shekels and a ban from entering Israel. You have 13 minutes to think about it. You can't take medicine on an empty stomach, son. There. I've eaten now. 350 shekels That's a lot, it is true. Had you gone with the smuggler you would have stayed with Salwa for two weeks and finished your job. It's as if she's sitting with us. Answer and tell her that I forgot the phone here and left. Hello. Yes, my dear Salwa. What's wrong? Here he is. Yes, Salwa. When? Damn it. You told me to wait for you exactly where I am Where did I tell you? - Greetings. - No, no, you can go ahead. - No problem, I am waiting but... - Nader? Just a second. - Yes? - We spoke on the phone. OK, I'll call you back. I'll call you back. - Looks like you've been running. - I didn't want to miss you. It's OK. - Here's the 250 shekels. - Thanks. - You are welcome - Have a seat. Thanks. - Shall we go? - In a bit. - When? - In a bit. Be a little patient. Could you turn it down, please? Where are you off to? Excuse me I have a severe headache. We can share a taxi once we cross, where are you going? - Where are you going? - My son is in the hospital. I would appreciate it if we leave now. - I hope it's not serious. - Me too, thanks. - Going to Jerusalem? - No, to Hadera. Hadera! I worked on the hospital manager's house! I can introduce you to Dr. Fieldman himself. - Dr. Fieldman! All the way? - Do you think I'm joking? - Did you try a medical permit? - Everything happened today And I didn't have time to get a permit or anything else Can we start moving now? How did he go to the hospital without you? - He lives with his mother in Israel. - Why don't you have a residency? If your wife lives in Israel, you can so easily get a permit. Or are you banned for security reasons? How long do we have to wait? Like 10, 15 minutes? I really don't know Maybe 10 minutes or an hour we need more passengers. - Greetings. - Hello Are you the driver? - This is not a service bus. - I know. - Smuggling? - Yes - You will be smuggled? - That's right. - Are you sure? - Yes. Sure? Mr. Nader! We have two passengers here. Here he is - Greetings. - Hello. - Greeting Mr. Nader - Hello So? - You have a foreigner with you. - Yes How much will you charge us? - 700 for the two of you. - But you took 250 for one. Let's go! Why do you interfere? Let a man earn a living! Dear, go find someone willing to smuggle a foreign woman and then come back to talk to me Let her pay What's your problem anyway? - What's wrong? - He wants 700 - 500! - No 500, 700! - Dangerous! - No, just 500 Go for 600. Go for 600 - 600, for you. Cash! - OK. 600 Shall we move? What is she doing here? She is probably looking for work. They are not happy that am here right? Yeah, but never mind Show me. Crazy! Slow down! I'll spill the coffee all over myself. Your arm should act like a hydraulic system, let me show you. Look... When you steer left Look, you go left, it goes left When you steer right, you go right. Understood? You have to sense it. - This is an art, you must feel it. - Give it back to me. Hello Abu Nidal Yes, we left a while ago. Listen, I won't go to work tomorrow also Okay, you need to find someone else. Thanks for your wishes. Bless you, bless you Bye - Hey, can I have a cigarette? - Yes, here you go. - Here you go - Thank you. Here's the lighter. I want to ask you Do you work in Israel, inside?

Everything was fine We were driving and... and he was playing music from... from the radio and then he... He received this phone call that I... I think that he told them that the first car was caught How did you know? From his body language He got so scared and I thought that might be the only thing that... That makes him so scared Did you scare him with your camera? He saw a video of himself and the other guys I told him the police were coming He hit me on my head with his gun and... You could have killed us with your film - Yes - Are you okay? I told both of you She shouldn't be filming This kid could have died because of your fucking film Easy! Feel with her She could have died! And we were going to live? We all could have died! Anne. How about I take you where I previously crossed? The wall was low from the other side. But guys, we have an Israeli car. We can drive to the settlements' checkpoint No, why did you choose the settlements' checkpoint? Go on your own. - What about that checkpoint? - They don't always check IDs. It's all a matter of luck if you have a cool look, it's okay. If they made a sign for you open the window "All good?" They'll ask in Hebrew. And you'll say, "All good, dude." And if the soldier is a chick you gotta be in charge fully. You'll tell her, "Hey you! How's it going? Awesome!" - I passed from there twice. - You can speak Hebrew? I only know those two words. Why didn't you just do that? Because I don't have an Israeli car. How about your cousins who have a wedding? Why didn't they take you? I say we stick to Rami's idea. Let's not get ourselves into a deep mess. Here comes your girlfriend. Tell her. I didn't want to put anyone's life in danger I... I... I'm sorry, please... I'll go check on Rami. He's taken too long. May I use your phone? I don't have a card but she has a Palestinian number. - Can he use your phone? - Yes, of course Thank you Salwa? This is not Salwa's phone? Who are you? No, this is not my phone. I will give it to her. Yes, she's fine. I am just a friend who met her today. Who are you? You want me to pass her a message? OK. You better go check on Rami. He is not that fine What's up, Rami?
