[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] SULLY: [OVER COMM] Tex-52, wanna call it a day? How's it looking by you? Dirt and rocks. Just like the last hour and the hour before that. REYES: All right, head out. I'll be there in a few. Best part of the day. Wait a minute. What is it? Tracks at the mace. One of ours? No, I don't think so. Storm drain dumps out on the other side of the hill. Let's link up over there. [SPEAKING SPANISH] 865, two to three sets of tracks moving into the storm drain at Echo-31. Moving to pursue. 865, tracks have split. Continuing pursuit one-half mile north-east of Echo-31. [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE EXCHANGE] 865, requesting backup. Look like they cut the road at the wash. [BOTH GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE EXCHANGE CONTINUES] [GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE EXCHANGE] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Sully, you okay? Sully! - [SULLY GROANING IN PAIN] Emergency response needed. One-half mile northeast of Echo-31. One friendly down, knife wound to the chest. One hostile in custody. [RUSTLING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SHUDDERING] [GUNSHOT] [WOMAN SOBBING] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [SOBBING] They're taking him back to base. Air lift him to UNC from there. At least they got him stable. [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] You all right? Yeah. What's the story on the girl? I'm sure it's nothing you ain't already heard. Any documentation on her? If she had, she wouldn't be trying to squeeze through a storm drain. Says they were supposed to be meeting up with her parents. They got by us a couple of days ago. 3-L took out her older siblings. That explains a lot. What are we doing with her, then? We'll hold her for the night, but she'll be back in Mexico by morning. Think we should look at the parents first? She's got nobody now. Ah, they're long gone. Especially with a couple of days' head start. Probably deep inside New Mexico. Hell, maybe even Texas. Sorry, Reyes. You know how these things go. Go on home. There's nothing we can do here now. All right, Chief. SPORTS COMMENTATOR: The Clippers will send Rodriguez to the mound. The three-game series is even at one of these, after the Saints batted around twice in the top of the ninth last night, scoring 12 runs to win the game fifteen to four. In the West, the levels of... WOMAN: [OVER PA] Quick reminder about next week's fun run. Attendance is mandatory. Check in with your supervisor... How's it out there? Prison 103. Fuck! MAN: Burke, you're back up. You're covering for Reyes. - Chief? - Morning. You got a minute? All day, apparently. MORRIS: Reyes, this is Ivan Sloane. He just transferred here from Texas. You got three minutes. Ivan and his team specialize in foreign and domestic counter-terrorism operations. Washington has cycled him through here to assist us with a level three classified threat. As of right now, their primary focus in on the Chacal cartel. You know anything about them? Nothing other than hearing something about them making their way east. They had, but we changing their game in the world of narcotics trafficking. Washington's issued a state of emergency for the entire Southwest. Ivan here's managed to push them out of Texas, effectively cutting them off. He and his team have extensive experience in these kind of containment things. Containment? Chacal cartel's brought something new to the state. It's a nasty, highly toxic substance. Rivals the effect of heroin three times over. So what do you need me for? MORRIS: Well, there's been sightings of this shit as far as the Texas-Louisiana border. Ivan and his team believe they've seized all the supply of the product, pushed it out of Texas, through to New Mexico, and now to right here. Now, we haven't had any confirmed cases in Arizona yet, and by God, I'd like to keep it that way. So they've asked that we put our top guys onboard with Ivan. And seeing as how this will be the cartel's last and probably hardest push, they could use the extra hand. Something on your mind? MORRIS: Well, you think about it. We can get back to it. IVAN: What's a Mexican doing in Border Patrol? What does that have to do anything with it? The Chief gave me the rundown on you, and that's all well and good. But if you wanna roll with my guys, you're gonna answer my questions. I didn't ask to roll with anybody. Your family got their citizenship, came over here legal. That's great. But, land of opportunity, and you chose this path? Why? [SCOFFS] You're right. My father did get us our citizenship. But not before getting denied twice on a 22 month waiting period. He fought to get us here. I wanted to do something to contribute to a place he knew was gonna give us a better way of life. I'm sorry my career choice disappoints you. Not all of us come here to paint your houses and build your fences. Reyes, nobody can be assigned to this. You got to give it a yes or a no. I'm also told you wanna work your way up to NSA level someday. One word from me and they'll come knocking. But if he doesn't wanna do it, you can just throw somebody else at me. We'll start again tomorrow. What did you say you're here for again? IVAN: We're small men teams going after big targets. The reason this is such a tier-one issue is because it produces a flesh-eating virus, and viruses spread. This is still an entirely foreign substance, and its cause of contraction, other than direct use, s currently unknown. Seems like something we can handle on our own. I seized over 600,000 pounds of narcotics, and shut down the largest human trafficking circle Brazil has ever seen. I'm here to make sure that this nasty shit doesn't get into our country. It rips the flesh right off the bone. To the junkie, it's just the next high, and they'll pay dearly for it. Poor bastards don't know the difference until it's too late. And they'll make a profit on it while the rest of the country kills itself from the inside out. If it gets out and goes widespread, your chief is right. A lot of innocent families try to get into the country the right way. But they end up getting denied, because they're already infected by it. You'd be helping to put a stop to that. IVAN: But if he wants to stay where he's at, it makes no difference to me. We'll just run down the list until we find someone that sticks. [PHONE BEEPS] [SNIFFS] You the new dick? What? Our new guy. Yeah. Reyes. So, you know the deal for tonight? Ivan will fill us in. Try to keep up. Don't shoot any of us. And take that shit off. Keep your civvies on. Plate on your chest. [VELCRO SNAPPING] All right. Neighbors called in on suspicion of sheltering some undocs. We don't have a head count. Could be two, maybe twenty. Hostile? Weapons on sight? Also unknown. Neighbors say they only leave the property after dark. So, stay sharp. Rules of engagement are weapons-free. Is that necessary? Reyes, everyone. Everyone, Reyes. Make no mistake. These people are enemies of the state and should be treated as such. All right? Let's hit it. Reyes, your bean speak is probably the strongest. So you're first to the door. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] IVAN: Don't fuck this up. Cover yourself. You don't want these fuckers seeing your face. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Get on the fucking ground. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Down! We're good! Don't fucking move! Is anyone else here with you? - SHANE: It's all clear. - Copy. Make yourself useful. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Yes. IVAN: What are you doing here? I'm here to work. That's all. I heard that one before. I have documentation. Documentos. I'll show you. Don't move. Where is it you work? The man that owns the house has small business. Okay? I work there. He pay me very little, but he let me stay here. Until I have money for my own house. Okay? Please. I'll show you my documentos. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PAPER RUSTLING] Follow this man right here. We just have a few papers for you to sign, and then we'll let you get back to your evening. Reyes. SHANE: Go. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SIREN WAILING] I think somebody's here for you. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Good evening, fellas. I'm taking that one in overnight, but the place is yours. What's the story with him? His papers check out. He works for the house owner. - Where's he? - I don't know. So, maybe you should run his papers. All right, I'll be in and out. Copy that. Hey. What are they doing here? All calls originating from neighborhoods like this go to us and the PD, but they still have jurisdiction. It's all good though. I told 'em my deal. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] - Yeah. - Hey. I need you to get him out of the vehicle. Step out. Get out of here now. Hands behind your back. - What? - Do not move. Hey, hey. What's happening? Found an unregistered weapon and narcotics under the bed. [SPEAKS SPANISH] That's not mine. REYES: I checked the bed. And look what you missed. Wait. No, no, no, no. [SPEAKS SPANISH] You can't do this. You can't do this to me. I've done nothing. Fuck you! Fuck you, puto. [VEHICLE STARTS] Where are they taking him? He'll spend the night in county, then headed back to Mexico. REYES: What about his papers? You know how long it took him to get those? IVAN: Probably less than an hour. They're fake. - What? - Fake, forced, void. Whatever you wanna call it. And you know that for sure? I wouldn't be in my position if I wasn't. Cartel boys have been swapping tactics lately. Sending innocent civvies as scouts. This right here proves they can provide passable documentation. I'd like to see his papers. What? His papers. Can I see them? No can do. PD already has them in evidence. Listen, Reyes. You're gonna have to pick up on some things if you wanna stick around. You wanna get the bad guys? They wanna get you more. Think about this as a learning experience. You should just soak up how desperate they are to keep their teeth dug into us. Get that, Ivan. What about the homeowner? There's a chance that stuff could have been his. Not likely. But PD will be following up with him. I know how you feel about these people, and I understand why. But if you let your emotions rule your trigger finger, they will take advantage of you. We're going out again soon. You ready to roll? Yeah. Yeah, listen, um... Sorry that your first day out with us had to be like that. You care about these people. I'm nobody to judge that. Unfortunately, days like that are the nature of the beast. You got to learn to expect that not everybody is what they seem. I know. It's just the look in his eyes, you know. You think he's innocent? You got to keep that inside, lock it away. These monsters will take everything from you that they can possibly get, regardless of the fact that you share a skin tone. They're not monsters. But when you put that uniform on, you became one of them. You father was a proud citizen of this country, I'm sure. I know that you are, too. You just gotta be willing to uphold that, whatever the cost. See you outside, yes? Yeah. All right. [IVAN EXHALES] [CLATTERS] [COUGHING] Your first cookout? My what? - [CONTINUES COUGHING] - You'll adjust. Check the size. I wager they drove off at three, four mil in profit. Took every cent with 'em. All of it untaxed. No, sir. Not all of it. [WHISTLES] - That's a good one. - Mmm-hmm. Clear and not a cloud in sight. [SNORTS] REYES: Hey! What the hell is that? Easy there, spick. - Eyes on the line. - Fuck you. I saw what the hell you did. - IVAN: All right, everyone. Dial it down. - Oh, yeah? We got a problem? REYES: You're gonna have a fucking problem when Morris finds out about this. That's gonna be real hard to do when the next bus back to red, white and green is dragging your brown, lifeless ass behind it. - The fuck you talking about, bitch? - Enough! Take a walk. Walk. And you, come with me. Now let's talk about what you thought you saw before you do something stupid like dragging your captain into this. There's nothing to talk about. A member of whatever branch of the U.S. Government has an illegal substance in his system, while on duty. This will be reported to Morris. Well, I'd think long and hard before doing that. Especially when you have no proof. I watched him do it. Maybe he watched you do it. Maybe we all did. And you don't think they could find their way around a piss test? What the hell is this? This is whatever you want it to be. It can be your ticket upstairs with the big boys, or the end of your time at BP. But what it won't be is finger pointing, because you're a little shy in the sheets. You run a different kind of show around here, and I get it. Nothing makes sense to you now. But I can assure you that all that was was a field op at the top of his game testing the purity of our friend's product. Bullshit. We got people for that kind of thing. You're not gonna dangle a pay raise in front of me and expect to pull the shades over my eyes that easily. Sometimes, to get into the mind of a monster, you have to dine at the same table. Now, you don't have to be here. I told you that from the very beginning. So suck it up, gut it up until we're done and get my recommendation, or jump ship. But don't threaten me. I guarantee you that'll be the last mistake you make. Come on. Done here. [EXHALES] [SPEAKING SPANISH] - [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - Chief, you got a minute? MORRIS: Sure. I'd like to hear about that cook site anyway. Everything run smooth, I take it? That's what I wanted to talk to you about, actually. Ivan and those guys are the best, aren't they? We're lucky to have 'em. Where exactly are they from, Chief? I know they spent some time in Texas. But beyond that, what? Are we looking at DOD? CIA? Something even above that? May I ask why you're suddenly so interested? I just wanna know what we're dealing with, Sir. Well, to be perfectly honest with you, your guess is good as mine. They're here to help with the never-ending struggle. And for that reason alone, I don't ask that question. None of the station chiefs do. I think it's in our best interest if we ask them to leave and let us handle this. What the hell are you talking about, Reyes? This is a shot any one of your colleagues would love to have. And it's an opportunity for you to rock it up the ladder. Beyond that, it's Washington finally admitting that we have a serious issue down here. They've listened and now they've answered. Now, unless Ivan's done something that would warrant me calling up the chain, I've got no power over him. They stay until the job's done. Reyes? No, nothing, Sir. They just work a little differently. I'm not sure it's where I want to be. You're an outsider to 'em. We're all on the same team and they know that. You could learn a lot from Ivan. Now, if you want off the assignment, I can't make you stay. But I'd like to see you finish. They could use a guy like you. Thank you, Chief. You got a visitor, by the way. Back from the dead. You can't get rid of me that easy. So, what's it looking like, man? That fucker missed my hart by a fraction of an inch. Can you believe that? What heart? [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Well, you look good. - Oh. It hurts to put a shirt on. But sitting on my ass at home? That's the real killer. I hear that, man. Listen... I fucked up out there. I didn't have your back. It may be one of those backs that wasn't for you. You saved my ass. We are all ready for you to be back. I should be cleared for light duty in a couple of days. They definitely don't look like they're from around here. Transfers from Texas. I'll tell you about that later. We're over-staffed the way it is. So why don't you come by tomorrow? Jen's having a get-together, and Haley keeps bugging me about you. - Oh, man. Wouldn't miss it. - All right. [DOOR OPENS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY] You still have a few years by my count. Are you gonna tell on me? Couldn't look the other way. I need something to sway my decision. That beer would be a good start. Your gut says otherwise. How is summer school treating you? Six hours a day, on top of dad giving me the daily guilt trip about having to cancel our vacation. Wow. Your dad wasn't the best in school either, but you didn't hear that from me. Try to hit the range this weekend, if you wanna get schooled again. As soon as you can convince him to take me off the chain. You've been pretty good. I'll see what I can do. I just have to get through senior year, and I'm gone. Well, whenever you decide to break that news to him, take it easy. He's been through a lot. He cares about you. Still gonna need that. SULLY: There he is. She's getting tall. I know. It's funny. Sometimes it seems like she'd rather live with you than with us. When are you gonna have some of your own? Ha! He'd have to get a date first. That hole in your chest hasn't affected your ability to cut me down. JEN: Don't pay any attention to him. That's just him covering up that he actually missed you the other night. - Is that right? - I'm on a lot of medication. Mind if I steal him for a minute, Jen? Sure. It's good to see everything's solid on the homefront with you, man. Yeah, I can't complain. How about you? Morris said you're running solo. Not quite. The transfers from Texas. Are you training them or what? No. Something's going on that needs to stay between us right now. Can't tell anyone. Not even Jen. Chacal hit something new at us and it spread through the Southwest already. Is it on the methamphetamine shelf? I don't know. But it got Washington to issue a state of emergency. Those guys you saw yesterday? They're leading a containment effort against it. Damn. Morris say where they're operating out of? Feds maybe? I've been asking that for two days. So far, no straight answer. But this definitely has "cartel" stamped all over it. I'd give anything to go out with those guys. See some real shit. You know I can't ask that from you or Jen. Not after what happened. I let you down once. I can't let that happen again. Think doc will be good with you on your feet tomorrow? Fuck if I care. Most action I've seen is walking to the mailbox. I hear you, man. How's that shoulder? SULLY: It's all right. It'll be good. MALE TV REPORTER: We're also learning this morning more about the killing of a U.S. Border Patrol agent along the Mexico-Arizona border Tuesday. FEMALE TV REPORTER: Josh, good morning to you. This is a very famous drug-trafficking corridor. One of the most famous, in fact, of the entire border. And for that reason, investigators suspect what happened to Agent Ivy could be connected to narco-trafficking. This morning, these hills in Nago, Arizona, just three miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, remain a crime scene. MAN: Agent Ivy died in the line of duty. Protecting our nation against those who threaten our way of life. FEMALE TV REPORTER: This morning is a search for his killer. Border Patrol agents are remembering the life of one of their own.

Where did you pick these guys up from? [DISPATCHER OVER RADIO] Gray sedan, heading east down on 155. One mile out. [IVAN SIGHS] Hey, uh, what's that plate again? All right. Last name? Got him. [SIREN BLARES] [INDICATOR TICKING] Where the fuck are you going? That piece of paper your daddy got you don't mean shit. You wanna wear my stripes? Show me why. Stay here. [SPEAKING SPANISH] SHANE: Ask for their papers. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What's the hold up? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Sir, may I see your papers? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Get him out of here! [SPEAKING SPANISH] What are you doing? They were fake. And how the hell do you know that? You practically made that kid shit herself into not talking. [VELCRO SCRAPING] [SIGHS] [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO] SULLY: Sure this is cool? Fresh cook site, tents in the area. If we run into the heat, they're gonna have the extra hand, whether they want it or not. If there's something you're not telling me, now's the time. These guys work a little differently. Who's this? This is Sully. He just got back from med leave. And what's he doing here? Active site. We can use an extra gun with us. Made that decision on your own, huh? These are my guys. And their lives are my responsibility, not yours. You don't get to decide who comes into the circle. I do. Hostile cook site, or a fucking game of hopscotch, I'm not about to let somebody I don't know tag along. I'm sorry he told you one thing and I'm telling you another, but there's no room for you here. Let's go. REYES: He stays, I stay. You wanna go in shorthanded, that's fine. I don't have to be the Fed to know when to call in help. All right. But he's your baggage. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [DEVICE BEEPING STEADILY] [BEEPING ACCELERATES] [PHONE DIALING] [LINE RINGING] [MAN OVER RADIO] We got a white male, black tank top, black pants. Wandering around two miles east off the road. How you doing today? Can't complain other than this heat. The chopper spotted you wandering around out here. You mind telling me what you're doing out here? I'm just coming from San Lucas. Me and my wife doing the resort thing for a week. Your wife? Yeah, she forgot something back home, so I just came to go get it. And you were looking for it out there? No, I didn't have a signal, so I was just hoping to get a bar or two. Well, it's a hell of a drive. Where you heading to? Uh, we live just in Sahuarita. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you what you're doing all the way over here then. Living in Sahuarita, you'd wanna pass through our Nogales station. Same one you came through on your way in. You're in Agua Prieta. 115 miles east of where you should be. Look, it's our first time down here. I probably just got turned around. This is a major quarter for drug activity. A lot of people wanna pass through here. People you don't wanna run into. I understand. I'm very sorry. Well, I'm happy to get you where you need to be. I appreciate that. Thank you. Well, you got a GPS or anything like that? Uh, I should. Well... I guess no vacation would be complete without it, right?

What are you guys cooking up out here? If it's anything like that last site we found, I'd venture to say your outfit needs a new chef. Shit was weak. [SPEAKING SPANISH] No. Get him some water. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MIGUEL SCREAMS IN PAIN] Miguel... [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LOUD CLATTER] [MIGUEL GROANS IN PAIN] [MIGUEL SPEAKS SPANISH] [IN SPANISH] [MIGUEL GROANS] [REYES SPEAKING] Don't drink that. Jesus fuck. Shane. They aren't pedaling bottom shelf product anymore. What the hell is that? No official name in the books yet, but for now, they're calling it Krokodil with a "K", gets its name from the pattern it leaves on the victim's skin. We weren't sure if it had made its way out of New Mexico yet, - guess we just got our answer. - REYES: Is there a vaccine? Something we can administer to at least fight it? Doubtful. Obviously, this little one didn't mean for it to happen, so it was probably an accident. Small amount in water, hell, maybe even the constant fumes did it. Supposed to be the best high in the market, but as you can see, it comes with a cost. I don't suppose you'll be sampling then. The more a person does, the further it spreads over the body. You do enough of it, she'll eat right through to the bone. It could be prone to spread through saliva, maybe even contact. We'll get them in to see somebody, get the little girl up there, get the dad fixed up. You two come back to HQ with me. Shane and the boys can wait for emergency response to arrive. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MAN PANTING] - [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - Sir? MORRIS: Hell of a day from what I hear. - Y'all headed out for the night? - SULLY: Yeah. And it's more than I can say for you. All good things in this job come with a whole shit storm of paperwork. And with this 240lb seizure of Croc this afternoon, it's created a whole new list of problems. If that transport hadn't been caught with a bag of cheap weed in the glove box, this would all be sold on every corner in the south barrio by sundown. I took Sully along today. And? Well, Ivan's definitely a personality that takes some getting used to. I mean, his whole team is. But he did everything by the book as far as I could tell. Matter of fact, he's the one that spotted it. If it hadn't been for him, we might all be in the ICU right now. Has he filled you in on the rest of Ivan's activities - since his arrival? - SULLY: Yes. And I'm no way defending him, sir. Good, don't. 'Cause I called the station chief over in Texas, he had the same problems there. Cleaned up a hell of a mess but he's a loose cannon when it came to handling other affairs. So, how did they handle him? From what I hear, the best thing we can do is just wait him out, and that's exactly what we're gonna do here. They'll move on from here just like they did in Texas. SULLY: What I don't understand is, how something like this has been allowed to go on for so long. I mean, I know these are some higher-ups, but someone even above them must've heard something by now. Unfortunately, in cases like this, where the primary objective is being met, all else is forgiven. Ivan produces results, so he's left alone. I can't say whether or not his promise to boost NSA is true, what I can say is this, after what you've seen, nobody, I mean, nobody, including me, can expect you to stay with this guy. That's decision that's yours and yours alone. Thank you, sir. But I have to stay, and not for his offer. - Reyes... - I want him to know that everything he's done has been witnessed, and will be documented for the day he has to answer to it. I don't want you doing this. Is that an order? No, it's not an order. If this is something you feel like you need to see through, then you do it together. But you stay back. That is an order. Unfortunately, we live in a time where the sun doesn't have to be down for bad people to come out. You know what I mean? I'd like to speak with the family from today, see how the kid is holding up. What family? The family we retrieved from the cook site today. Ivan's guys brought the girl in for treatment. Reyes, they came back alone. SULLY: Reyes! - Reyes! - [REYES GRUNTS] [BOTH MEN GRUNTING] What the fuck is your problem? - Where are they? - Who? Don't fuck with me. You were supposed to bring them in. What the fuck did you do, Ivan? MORRIS: That's enough, Ivan. Let him up - Go back inside, Chief. - [REYES PANTING] - [GUN CLOCKS] - I said let him up. IVAN: You sure you wanna do that? I doubt my people would like hearing about this, not that it would affect me any. You're the one who's gonna be out of a job. That's a risk I'm willing to take. At least we'd get the answer to where a piece of shit like you comes from. Now, I've asked you twice to let him up. I won't ask a third time. You were supposed to bring them back. [PANTS] - You saw the shape the kid was in. - Exactly. We're dealing with an element we don't understand. If we had brought them in, this entire facility would be on lock down right now under a plastic bubble, and we'd all be getting scrubbed down by hazmat. Getting you to leave was the only way I could do what needed to be done. - You mean killing them? - Transporting them to CDC. - That's bullshit. - If you wanna go back out and dig through ditches, be my guest. But something like this can't be taken lightly. If this proves to be airborne, then they're exactly where they need to be right now, with the lab coats at disease control. You're too attached. Grow the fuck up and realize that it's not about you wanting to do the humane thing. - If it was up to me... - [SHOUTS] If it was up to you, we'd all be in jeopardy right now. I am this close to finally putting this thing to bed forever and if you or you get in my way, I will run you over. I think it's best that we just run our course, finish this and then we'll be on our way. No sense in anyone getting hurt when we're all playing for the same side. Right, Chief? [GUN CLOCKS] Let's not let all of this hide the fact that we did solid work today getting intel on a hot spot for resupply. We're hitting that tomorrow, but tonight, we celebrate. Celebrate what? Another day that we get to come home from this job. That's reason enough for me. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] [DOOR CLOSES] [MEN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SHANE: Hard time finding the place, ladies? You made it. What do you think, slugger? - Certainly not your first rodeo. - [IVAN CHUCKLES] Keg's over there. - You good? - Yeah. Sit or take a walk, but don't just fuckin' stand there. You good for tomorrow? REYES: Why? Big day for you, first time running your luck with the Chacal boys. What makes you say that? Those guys back at the cook site were cartel guys. [IVAN CHUCKLES] No. Those were pissant errand boys, "pledges" if they have such a thing. And I know it's your first time. I see it in your eyes. There's still a lot they haven't seen. Been in this long enough to tell who's everything, and who hasn't. Same for Sully. Something happened that almost took him away, now it's carved in his face. and it'll never change. I don't know what it was, but he came close. It wasn't Cartel, if that's what you think. I know that. I don't glorify them the way everyone else seems to. The only thing that separates them from any other bad person out there with a gun is numbers and organization. Anybody can pull a trigger. It's not all you gotta be prepared for. It's the aftermath, shit they leave in their wake. That kind of inhumanity stays with you. Sometimes, I think I could have stayed where I was at. Nice desk job in DC, steady paycheck. Really steady. Stayed married. [CHUCKLES] But after 14 years of the same shit, a man wants more. She said she'd leave. if I took the job. She thought it'd change me. Did it? No, Reyes. I've always been a patriot. I have the old man to thank for that. I just grew tired of... hearing about the same fuckin' people helping themselves to my home, my... home, my opportunities. That's when I decided to put myself on the very front line and do anything I could to stop it. Give up anything including... a 14 year-old marriage. Sounds like quite the decision, leaving that all behind, somebody that loves you. I'm just trying to ask myself... was I happy, or just unaware. When you give up everything except that one thing... that you really care about, you're able to be the very best at that one thing. You protect it from anything that comes in its path. That one thing for me is country. I bet a lot of people have been caught in your path. Mm-hm. And you don't remember a single face, do you? They're all a stack of papers. Well, that's not entirely true, Reyes. The coyotes transporting a truck load of shooters to a checkpoint for an ambush, I remember their faces. The woman... dragging the filthy mattress stuffed with three dead infants back to the family they've been abducted from. Not good with names, but I remember her, too. Just the bad ones then. What about anybody legal that's been unfortunate enough to come in contact with you? Oh, I remember you. Fine, fine. [CHUCKLES] El Paso. Shane and I had been... holed up with the guys in a shit ass motel with no AC for about eight days, waiting to... get a tip on the whereabouts of Nesto "The Diamond" Padilla. Nesto was number three on the Chacal chain. [WOMAN SCREAMING] - [GUN FIRES] - [MAN GRUNTING] - [CLAMORING] - [WOMAN SCREAMING] [WOMAN SOBBING] - Ivan? - I don't know what happened. Adrenaline from the fight, being cooped up with four guys in a hotel, a wound still fresh from a divorce. Even seeing your friend get shot. But something came over me, Reyes. [INAUDIBLE] I did the right thing. The husband didn't even fight us putting him on the back of a bus. More importantly, cartel have one less place to hide from me. Do you know why they called him "The Diamond"? Motherfucker has a... 14-carat rock for a tooth. I bet that shit's a blood diamond, too. Never did catch him. Hey, Reyes. Thanks for coming by. Really. [WATER SPLASHING] [CAR DOOR CLOSES, ENGINE STARTS] You sure about this? You don't have to come. I'll tell them you're too hungover from last night or whatever, but I'm going, even if you don't have my back. It's not what I'm saying. Really? 'Cause I kinda think it is. This isn't what you and I do. Kicking down doors, fire fights, we don't have the training for it, to survive it. You're the one who wanted to go out with these guys so bad. What happened? I just don't have a good feeling about today, okay, man. - I'm scared. - So am I. But that and fear aside, you didn't have to hear the things he said to me. If I don't do something while I have him in my sights, he's gonna disappear forever. I need you on this, man. [SIGHS] Reyes. You're here early, Chief. Yeah, I came to see y'all off. Listen, be careful out there today. Hang back, let Ivan do this thing so he can get out of here as soon as possible. Listen, do not draw a line in the sand with this man unless you're prepared to have him step across it. Read me? All right. See y'all when you get back. All right, guys, the day is here. Since beefing up the two main arteries at the border, Three Points has become the biggest trafficking corridor. That's where we're going. Our target sits in a very open area of land, which leaves a lot of room for hazard and none for mistakes. BP has been kind enough to convoy with us, but in order to maintain the element of surprise, we're gonna have to break it off and hoof it a mile out. This is a large resupply hub for the Chacal Cartel, headed over by our boy, Javier Arturo. We don't know what we'll be walking into, our objective is to cut off any resources they have when crossing the border, and prevent any more of this nasty shit from coming in. If you find any of the substance on site, back the fuck off. That's a hazmat issue, not ours. We're going in to clear, gather information on any more of the little motels that they have, and get the fuck out. As always, hope for the best, prepare for worst. [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [ANGEL CHOKING] [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] [DOOR OPENS] - [GUNSHOT] - [MAN GROANS] [GUN FIRES] [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Go out the back. [MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [EXPLOSION] - [GUNSHOT] - [BODY THUDS] [RINGING] [MEN GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE] Do I look familiar? I'm here anyway. What the fuck, you hit me! [MAN GROANING] [GROANS] - Everybody else all right? - SHANE: House is clear. IVAN: Do another sweep, see what you can find. - It's clear. - Good. IVAN: Any more of your friends running around out there, Pablo? No Ingles? You should learn it by now, help you fit in well with the locals. Who else is out here? I really don't like surprises, so tell me now, and you might get out of this alive. 'cause it's not looking so good for you right now. What about shipment? Kroc? I know you didn't come up here for sightseeing, so where is it? Where's it going? How many more of these little vacation spots you got, hmm? Come up here, little fiesta, blow each other in the back room. [LAUGHS] [BOTH LAUGH] We hit a funny bone, didn't we? I think you do habla ingles just fine, don't you? [GRUNTS] How 'bout I skin you and your little fuckin' boyfriends, hang you out and leave the vultures to get at you, huh? I think that'd wipe the fuckin' grin off your stupid fuckin' face. REYES: You think their deaths weigh heavy on me? You don't get attached in this business. Any day, any damned day can be your last. So, if you're gonna threaten me, you're gonna have to try harder. [SPITS] - [SPEAKS SPANISH] - SHANE: Place is clean. [DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] Know what's nice about this? It doesn't run out of bullets. I can stick this anywhere until the sun goes down. I know you have more supply stops. Where? Even if I told you, you'd still kill me. See, I've know men like you. Your country has monsters - worse than ours. - IVAN: That's how we're able to to protect it. You will not leave this life without paying for your crimes. - Tell me where! - REYES: That's enough, Ivan. What are you doing, Reyes? - Putting and end to this. - To what? Getting intel from the enemy? Doing the job we all signed up to do? No. To you. Reyes, without me, there's no NSA boost. You'll stay right where you are birdwatching at the fence. I can live with that. Letting you leave and continue doing what you're doing... - is something I can't. - So what? You'll bury us all, drag him back to big daddy Morris, be the hero. That it? REYES: He's more valuable to us alive than dead. I'm not gonna waste the fucking energy digging you a grave. [GUNSHOT] What the fuck are you doing? Now that that's off the table, what are you gonna do? Drop the gun. Drop it! - [REYES BREATHING HEAVILY] - Fine. But only because I know this isn't you. You're not gonna shoot anyone. You have no escape plan and you know it. Six of us go in and only two of you come out? Might look a little suspect when my people come knocking. Especially, when four of their senior tasks agents couldn't handle five of these little lanky motherfuckers? Not likely. REYES: You say five. Maybe I say 15 and the others got away, but not before mowing your team down. Guess I taught you something after all, didn't I? But you're not gonna pull that trigger because that'll make you on step closer to being me. You put down that gun down, and there's a chance everybody can get out of here alive and we'll put it all behind us. You did a hell of a thing today, both of you. Cut off a major artery to the enemy, and now, they'll slowly funnel south until they're back on their own side. Damn fine work for two guys who were just watching the fence three weeks ago. - [GUN SHOTS] - [REYES AND SULLY GROAN] [PANTING] I had every intention of keeping my word and moving on when the job was done. I really did. You are where you are because of the decisions that you made, Reyes. And now you put somebody else's life on the line. How's that make you feel? You're a good man, Reyes. You stand up for your values and your beliefs, just as I do. I respect that. Which is why I hate that you put me in this position. But that's the nature of the job, to do what other people won't do, to remove yourself from right and wrong. It's what the people don't see that keeps the country safe. Unfortunately, now you've had to see those things. So, murdering a child and her father is keeping us safe? - IVAN: Collateral damage. - No. Don't. I know what you are. Morris knows what you are. Morris is smart and wants to keep his desk. Every station head is the same. They keep their mouth shut and let me pass through. Well, you can believe I'm gonna talk, make sure this whole fucking thing spills. No. You won't. Yeah. Every fucking word. Sully... I don't know the story on you, but you seem like a nice guy. Were you married? Have kids? Yeah. - A daughter. - How old? Teenager. That's nice. Anything you want your partner to tell her since you won't be coming home? He won't say anything, Ivan. This is between us. It's all right, man. [GUNSHOT] Have you swayed your stance on the situation yet? Get you back to HQ, get you fixed up, you'll be back at the fence in six weeks. Tell the NSA what a fine upstanding agent Reyes Abeyta is, worthy of promotion, and most importantly, you never have to see me again. All this can be yours for the promise of silence. What do you say? I say you're a piece of shit disgrace to your nation, who doesn't deserve this freedom. Just like the man who raised you. [TIRES SCREECHING] [DOG BARKING] [DOGS CONTINUE TO BARK] And yours would be disappointed that you gave up everything that you worked for. - [GUN SHOT] - [GRUNTS] [REYES GRUNTING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER IN SPANISH] [BREATHING HEAVILY] No. You don't speak to me in the language of the people you abandoned. And you've been fighting the war against my product. I think you know who I am. I sure know who you are. One of our own in uniform. I had to see it to believe it. And here you are. A lot of bloodshed, not likely the work of two people. Where's the rest of your boys? They left you, didn't they? You chose the wrong side, Pocho. You have to be feeling that now. Definitely now. Do what you're here to do. When I first heard of you, I was... sickened, disgusted to my core. You would turn away your own kind for a better life. I wouldn't want to live here. I love my country, my home, but... I get it You don't know anything about me. JAVIER: But I do. Your family wanted to get out, come live with the gringos, that's fine. But... to put on this uniform, take that oath against us, even to a guy like me, that's... cold blooded. Unforgivable. After I got through the phase of what I'd do to you if I ever found you, I started to see you as a blessing in disguise. Why kill you, when I could finally have eyes and ears on the inside. You made a long trip to be disappointed. Did I? REYES: A gun in my face won't sway me. The same way it didn't when the last one of you fucks tried it on my father. And he's dead. These aren't your beliefs, they're his. You're a free man, able to make his own choice, walk his own road. His was a selfish one that left your mother on her own. How is Elena, by the way? [JAVIER CHUCKLES] No. I won't kill her. She'll come work for me. I'll put Elena on her own corner on the busiest street in the entire city, buy her some new clothes, show a little skin. My girls have been known to pull in $4,000 to $5,000 in a week. Sometimes... I'm guilty of sampling myself. I'm a gentle soul. But I can't say the same for these pigs. [CHUCKLES] I can make you a very wealthy man, Reyes. You won't have to pull a single trigger. Whenever a move is made, you just let me know, okay? That's it. You can continue living where you are, be financially secure forever, you never even have to see me ever again. What do you say?
