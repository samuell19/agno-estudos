Kimble! Dr. Kimble, think now. Do you really want to do this? I don't want any of this! I didn't kill my wife! Jury said different... ...and my gun in your hand won't change that. I called the restaurant... ...they said you already left. I'm sorry, I was in surgery... ...working on this six-year-old kid who's a bleeder and.... Helen? - Hi. - Hey. - I missed you. - You did? Dinner was boring. - Dad says hi. - Hi, Dad. Hi. Doggie bag? It's.001 percent of the money. - OK, but your money. - OK. It's my money... ...but you want to keep me from spending it on a real house for us. - We don't have a real apartment? - No. It's real nice. But wouldn't it be great to have a house with a yard? Have a dog. Have a baby. My God. - Just so the dog doesn't get lonely. - Wait a minute. Did you say... ...you want us to have... ...a dog? It's a big responsibility. - A real dog? - No, silly. I want a baby. You are so bad. 3:00 a.m. feedings, I'm going to remember that, you know. Okay, I promise I won't talk about the house anymore if... ...if you can catch me. Wait for me. Speed Racer, where are you? All right. Okay. We'll get a dog. And the bat. The baseball bat. That's yours, right? You're sure you never saw this guy before? So, Dr. Kimble, the last thing you and your wife talked about was money? No. A house. She wanted to move. So you never even mentioned her money? It was about a house. It was about buying a house with her money from a trust, right? Her mom's estate. What, around $20 million? - I'm not sure how much. - Not sure? Another runner that day says he saw you grab and knock her down. No. We were playing. So, after this playing... - ...you come back here and see the guy-- - I told you. I grabbed him. His right arm was prosthetic. I had him. But Helen.... I couldn't get her to breathe again. Everything she ever was... ...every second of her whole life just... ...stopped because I didn't get there fast enough. Another minute and l could've.... Oh God! Where is he? Where is the man that did this to my wife? Dr. Kimble. My forensics team has bagged every millimeter of this room, twice. If a one-armed man was here that night, we'd have his skin... ...his hair, his trace fibers and most likely him... ...sitting in a cell. He's not here. He's out there! - Look for him! - We have. Look harder! We're done looking, Doctor. Wait. Wait a minute, you think that I.... No. Don't do this. She was my life. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, Doctor, one will be appointed for you. Are you clear on those rights? Richard David Kimble, the jury has found you guilty of murder in the first degree. Therefore, it is my judgment that you shall be remanded to the state prison... ...of Joliet, where you will await execution by lethal injection. May God have mercy on your soul. Don't you think prison transpo is above and beyond the call here? I start... ...I finish. Welcome to Nashville Library. Hi. I'm looking for a guy named Johnson. Fred Johnson. His right arm is missing. We're friends and... ...I heard he'd had some trouble. The police said he was staying here. Was. Was? He's gone? Do you want a room? Did he leave a forwarding address? No. Just some of his stuff, said he'd come back for it by Friday. Do you want a room or not? - How much? - $20. I'm gonna need picture ID. - You know what, I just-- - No picture ID, $40. Looking for work. You can have my job. Joke. They pick up the day jobbers in the parking lot on 23rd Street... ...by the marine supply store. Around dawn. And no cooking the fish. No loud music. You lose your key, $10! Morning, boys! Who's shaved and standing? All right, Steve, how many do we need today, six? - More like eight. - Six it is. Bobby, Fernando, Tony, come on. - How about it, man? - No. Not today, Joey. - Why don't you go sleep it off? - I'm fine. - What's your name? - Parks. Jim. Know what this is? Kind of a wrench? No. Well, at least you're honest. $100 a day. Cash. Hop in. Heads up! What are you gonna do? Dive after it? Get yourself another one. ...then freed, when fate moved its huge hand... ...in the icy darkness of a Chicago night. Today, Dr. Richard Kimble is at large. Wanted for both murder and interstate flight. Richard Kimble has sandy-blonde hair, hazel eyes.... So if Johnson does show up, I want to surprise him, you know? We're old buddies from the Army.... We play practical jokes on each other. We've been friends for years. I know it's a lot to ask, but how about $50, just to-- A day? You want to surprise Johnson, jump out of a cake. But don't try to tell me you're here for a hug. That one-armed freak, he ain't got no friends. Now $50 a day... ...no warning. The office said you'd be here tomorrow. I'd have straightened up... ...put real toilet paper in the head for you. They dropped the Hialeah job on me. - I've gotta be there tomorrow. - So? I don't have your mill certificates on your steel for the last three floors. And, I want your journeyman cards. We got a complaint you're using too many day jobbers. If I knew you were gonna pop quiz me like this, I'd have brought you an apple. Look.... I'll grab the heat numbers off the beams. You get me the paperwork on your guys. We meet downstairs, check your mill certificates. Coffee black, two sugars, right? That's a lot of city. How many men are you gonna put on this? For starters, we've Kimble on a statewide APB, most wanted. Personally, I'm gonna take point with Federal and County. - In other words, I've got Detective Kaznick. - Bob. Lieutenant Gerard. I've got 22 officers handling unlawful flight. And 30,000 fugitives. I don't know how you prioritize up in Chicago... ...but if all you've got here is the eyeball off a plumber with a couple of DUls... ...then as far as I'm concerned, Dr. Kimble is 30,001. You up for a little police work here, Bob? Foreman, call 911! We have a fall! All right, move your hand. I know it hurts. Come on. I need a knife. Somebody give me a knife! What the hell are you doing? There's blood in her lung, she'll choke to death. You breathe okay? Did somebody call an ambulance? It's on its way. - Don't leave. - Okay. Right here. He bumped me. He said, "Excuse me." Something like that. Bob, how long does it take to get a warrant down here? Warrant? A tiny piece of paper that helps you get around the Fourth Amendment. What do you want it for? I'm gonna take something from this bank, and I don't want to get arrested. Parks. Just want to tell you she's gonna be fine. That was a hell of a thing you did up there. - Thanks. - You're not some kind of nurse, are you? No. Army. I did some medical. Anyway, we're gonna try to keep this kind of quiet. Won't do the company any good to have police or reporters. Yeah. Sure. Unless there's something else you want to add? - You see something else up there? - No. There's an unwritten rule on these sites. Everybody minds their own business. What you did for Laura, nobody will deny that was the right thing. All I'm saying is, in future, a guy who knows the job... ...might not jump in so quick. 'Cause you never know what you're jumping into. You know what I mean? Yeah. Your friend called. He said he's tied up. He can't come to town until Monday. I've something else. Yeah? What? He's waiting for a package. Okay. I want to know when that package comes. Hey! Here we go. Okay, there's our plumber. Oh, boy. You might want to tell your captain, everybody's going into overtime. We got ourselves a manhunt. - Jim Parks. - Laura Chereaux. Weird, huh? Meeting now, after.... Anyway.... So, how are you? How's the.... They say I'll be out in a few days. That was some job you did. The doctor really wants to meet you. I can't stay. I just.... I needed to say something. I'm not sure, but.... What? You know Raynor's friend? - Steve Beech? - Yeah. He was there, just before you.... He was holding a hammer and the nails were.... Wait. Hold on. Are you saying that you saw him pull the nails out on purpose? I don't know what he was doing. I don't know what you're inspecting, but.... They have a few code violations but I know these guys. Raynor said something to me... ...after, about minding my own business. He was very.... I could be wrong, but.... Just be careful. Yeah, I'll check it out. Thanks. Well.... I should let you rest. Listen. I obviously owe you a lot more than saying.... I'm out of here on Friday and.... Could I cook you dinner? You look like you eat a lot, standing up. This is not going well. I could just drive a stake into this by telling you that I have... ...a seven-year-old that likes to stick beans up her nose when company comes over. God, this has got to be the drugs. What time Friday? A lesson in table manners. Thank you, Jim. Are you married? I was. All right. Finish up now, okay? See that? Metal rod, pointed on one end, wrench on the other. It's used in construction to line up steel beams. Called a spud wrench. Okay, now you're officially scary. How'd you know that? Insomnia. Discovery Channel. Let's make a list. Every building going up within a 50 mile radius. You got it. Sorry. She usually goes to sleep right away. She asked to see my stitches. My little girl asked me if... ...if I could've died. It got me thinking about everything I would have missed. Meeting her first boyfriend. Teaching her how to drive. Holding my grandkid. Up on that building, you saved two lives. There's too much about you that doesn't fit. I mean, you work in construction, you got no calluses. You have good manners. But you don't like questions. You're in trouble. - Let me help. - No. - I owe you. - You don't. Then I want to. You know... ...tonight is the first time in a long while that I've been able to sit... ...and enjoy anything. I wish things were different. I wish I was... ...different. I don't. Jim! Hi. Listen, I told my boss what you said about the ladder. How it was. We checked the steel up top again. Heat numbers say that it's high grade, but I just got the original mill certificates. Raynor's been using low-grade steel, charging the company high... ...and pocketing the difference. I show up a day early for an inspection, he can't cover up. No wonder he freaks. My boss thinks he pulled another scam like this in San Diego, four years ago. The building buckled. Six people died. He's on his way back now to the office. He's gonna call the DA. I figured you wouldn't want to be around. Thanks. So, I guess I'll never know. What? Whatever it was that happened to you. You call the cops? What'd you tell her? I don't know who that wanted guy is. But that's Raynor. Ask him. - He's up there. - Up there? I'll see what this Raynor knows. You and the deputies, keep your eyes on the lifts and stairs. See if we can get a positive ID and a hard location on Kimble. Okay. Ray, Chereaux's back. They've got your picture. She called the cops. One's on the lift. He'll be up there any minute now. Get the truck. Bring it around the south corner of the parking garage. I'll be there. The police aren't here for Raynor. They're after me. I don't care what kind of trouble you're in. Don't-- No. Come on. There's a ladder in the back that'll take you to the first floor. Mr. Raynor, I'm Lieutenant Gerard. Thank you. Drop it. Now, Dr. Kimble. - The man who killed my wife is in Miami. - Yeah. And I'm looking at him. Turn around. Hands behind your head. You're under arrest. - Bob, do we have that backup? - Yeah. Any second. I've got Kimble. We're headed down. Is he a friend of yours? No. Hands behind your back. Don't. Go. Do you know you're helping a convicted murderer? Aiding and abetting is a felony. Get over there. Give me your keys. Sure you don't want my wallet? Phone. I will not stop, ever. Neither will I. Something's wrong. Close off all the exits. - Nobody in or out. - There's 10 exits here-- - Just do it! You, you, come with me. - Yes, sir! Calling all police units: Suspect is Dr. Richard Kimble. Caucasian male. Medium build. What? - Get in. - What? You gotta stay away from me. Laura! Stay away from me! Kimble! Drop it! I said drop it! Don't move! You move, I shoot! Target in sight. I can take him out from here. Captain doubled up on exits out of town. We've four on tactical. Highway to harbor. I locked up the airport, cab companies, bus-- Miss Chereaux, hello? Could I talk to you? Talk to my partner over here. Miss Chereaux, Building Safety. You want to talk to her or not? I hear Dr. Kimble saved your life a few days ago. I hear I'm not the only one. Now how did you hear that? - He's a good man. - He's a wanted man. Did you help him? - That would be illegal, wouldn't it? - Very much so. Well, then I think you know my answer. Camelot. Yeah. It's Parks. You're looking for your one-armed friend? He was just here. Wait a minute. He was there? He was early, I guess. He picked up the package that he wanted and took off. You didn't stop him? He just walked out? He paid what he owed. Did he say where he was going? He had a bus ticket. ...Dr. Richard Kimble.... 696. Maybe he'll come back, honey. 696. Yeah, here we go. Route 409 out of Miami. Final destination: Savannah, Georgia. Savannah. Thank you. Mag, I think one of your students is playing a little joke. What a shock. Got a call from a Mr. I.M. Superior. Maggie? Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Richard! I wasn't sure you'd remember the name. Who's going to forget I.M. Superior, "older brother for life." We shouldn't talk too long. The man who killed Helen, I saw him. - Where? - Miami. I know he's headed north andl think I've figured out a way to find him, but... ...I need money. I've got to be in one place with a phone to get him to tell me where he is. - I'll send you whatever you need. - Just $200. - If you need more-- - Just for a few days. For a room. Just send cash, and don't use your real name. It's good to hear your voice bossing me around again. Yeah. Is there any way we can talk again? Any way I can reach you? No, it's too dangerous. He's not going to give up. - Who? - Gerard. I know a guy who could laminate that for you. Yeah. That'd be real nice, Captain. Thanks. So, Miami. I've known you a long time, Philip. Just say I happen to believe that letting go is not exactly your strong suit. Are you going to order me to step off the Kimble case? Are you telling me that if I do you're going to disobey? Yeah. Okay. Just so we're clear. Something like this, the press in your face, I.A. trying to pencil-screw you... ...and each time you look up, the wit and wisdom of your co-workers... ...there's a good chance you will have Kimble living in your head, rent-free. No. That's not happening. Good. Well, I'm on this. And that's where I'm gonna be till it's over. $5? $10. No checks. Can you give me that spelling again? Superior, as in the lake? Lake Superior, it's in Michigan. Never mind. How about superior as in superior intelligence? Right. Thank you very much. You have a good day now. I thought you cashed checks? Paychecks, money orders. This is a personal check. Please. I need this. It's good. Please. It will be. I post-dated it so when I get paid tomorrow, actually the day after... - ...it will cover the-- - I'm sorry. We don't cash personal checks. $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $900, $1,000. $1,000? I thought that-- Miss Superior sent you a $1,000, Mr. Superior... ...with a note saying that you lost your ID and that she will be at this number at... ...6:00 for five minutes every day. Thank you very much. Next please! Your name is Richard? You've had a blow to the head. We need to know if you remember your full name. You said Richard. Richard what? Sir! Take it easy now. Just stay right there, you're gonna be fine. - What? - You're all right. Easy, buddy. No, you gotta get to the hospital. I can't. I'm late. That's why I was running. It's important. You were just hit by a car. You've got lacerations, an open-head wound, possible internal injuries. Whatever it is, let them take you to the hospital. We'll get your name, address, and a statement. When they let you go, we'll drive you wherever you need to go. All right? Now, what's your name? I lost my wallet. Boy, you still got a name, don't you? - Sam. Sam Richards. - What's your address? Can we do this in the ER? Doc says he'd prefer you stayed overnight. Five stitches. You've got the statistical likelihood of a concussion. I got kids. Believe me, it ain't nothing but in and out of this place. Well, thanks for all your help, Officer. Valken. Ben Valken. Anyway, watch for signs of dizziness, nausea, things like that. I told you we'd take you where you wanted to go. And we can go over the last couple of things. - Great. - All right. Watch your head now. The driver said it looked like you were chasing some guy. No, I was just in a hurry. You gotta watch that. This looks like a sleepy town, but people here go just as fast as any place else. Are you hot back there? Want the air up? Yeah, a little. Give us a call when you settle in your hotel. Get your new ID in case there's anything we need to tie up accident-wise. - I will. Thanks again. - All right. One more thing. Welcome to Savannah. Where's my money? - Oh, no. - I don't want to call the cops. - Okay-- - I need that money! - It's gone. - What do you mean it's gone? - You spent it? All of it? - Gary, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Who's here? She's sick. She doesn't know what I did. Please don't tell her. - I'll make right by you but don't hurt her. - I need that money. There's nothing I can do. It's spent. Gary, what's going on? I'll be right there, baby. We'll work this out. Just give me a minute with her. What you needing, babe? Want to get up? All right, come on. One, two, three. That's a girl. Just a little bit more. Let's get you up so you can say hi, okay? That's a girl. Parkinson's? Yeah. How'd you know? Levodopa, Symetral, Deprenyl. You work in a pharmacy or something? "Something," yeah. Well, then maybe you know, without the medicine, it's.... This morning it got bad. Real bad. I'm working but it's temp. No insurance. You work, no Medicaid. You don't work, no food. This morning I had $9. This stuff, it costs, you can't even believe how much. That money was everything. - A place to stay, my next meal-- - Sorry... ...I swear, I've never done anything like this before. I want to try and.... I mean, you could stay here a couple of days. What? We could work something out. Like a trade? I mean, you need a bed, food? I'll pay you back every dime, I swear, but... ...you can't call the cops. Please. I'm all she's got. So how did you and Gary meet? Well, we-- He was at the check-cashing place, too. Said he needed a place to stay. Couldn't afford a hotel till he got a job. Offered to pay. We need the money. We never talked about renting to anybody before? From my last job, fixing copiers. Had me out on the road a lot. Company paid service till the end of the month. You can set up your own voice mail on that number there. A place and a phone. How much are we charging you? Pretty much all I have. Drugs aren't helping much? A lot less than they used to. It's hard to describe. My head is fine and I know what I want my body to do... ...it's just.... Like trying to drive a car with the parking brake on. Yeah. Sam used to work in the pharmacy business, he said. Then he must know it don't get any better. Don't talk like that, baby. Come on. Gary thinks there's miracles out there. You just get enough money or the right connections. - I keep trying to tell him-- - Well, there are treatments. Experimental mostly, the last time I read about it. Some patients get good results. Sometimes even amazing. See? Hey, Jeff! Think I got something. Bank statements. Kimble's father, sister, former associates, close friends, right? On the first warrants, I've a flag on anything out of the ordinary. Philip, I'm begging you, get a hobby. Look here, Maggie Kimble-Hume. Sister, divorced. Two kids. A teacher with a deadbeat ex... ...living from paycheck to paycheck, right? Yeah. Yesterday, she pulls a $1,000 out of her IRA. Cost her a $150. Now that's not like her. Do you know what she did with the money? I got a pretty good idea. Camelot. Yes, Mr. Fred Johnson, please. Checked out. Did he leave a number where he might be reached? Look-it, checked out means "gone." Well, it's important. We owe him a lot of money... ...for the loss of his arm. Go on. I'm with the Social Security Administration. Disability and Back Benefits. If you could have him give me a call... ...the number is... ...8-8-8... ... 5-5-5... ...0-1-0-0. About these benefits, I got some questions. I think I'm due. Well, you know the number now. You can always give us a call. You did write it down, didn't you? Yeah, I wrote it down, but... ...these benefits, are they for like, when you get hurt on the job? That's right. Look-it, when Johnson calls... ...I'll pass him the message. But then I'll call you, and we'll discuss my claim. Call anytime. Bastard. Sorry. - I didn't know you were here. - I came in off the porch. It's all right. Where's Gary? Work. Gonna be late tonight, he said. You okay? Fine. Yeah. I can go out if you want to be by yourself. You must be-- Here, come here. Sit down. Do you need your.... I just took 'em. It's a minute before they kick in. I won a dance contest, can you believe that? Three years ago, me and Gary. I can't remember what my body used to feel like. It's like I'm living inside this thing... ...and I wake up every morning... ...and think... ...it's just not me anymore, you know? I do, sort of. You know, you do remind me a little of Gary. Both the kind of man, always trying to help. Hard when there's nothing you can do, isn't it? I think I would like a little time alone here. Sure. Hello? Hello? Collect call from Mr. Superior. Will you accept? Yes. I'll need a current calling card. Put me through to detective headquarters. Priority request. - Richard? - You sent too much money. - No. - Listen to me. Thank you. But the withdrawal was too much. He's gonna catch it. Gerard will come to see you, and you'll have to explain it. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. 1957 Lake View Terrace, Deerfield. I want a hard trace to whatever number she's talking to. It'll be out of town. I want the city and the exact address. And you cannot move fast enough. Look... ...you can't wait at this number anymore. We can't talk. I can't go through another three months like this. We have to find a way. It's too dangerous for you. For the kids, for dad-- I don't care. I need to know you're all right. We have to figure out a way. If I can, I will. But this is not it. You'll have to trust me. Don't hang up yet. I believe in you, Richard. I never doubted you, I never will. You keep yourself safe. We're gonna get you out of this. I promise. How's dad? He's better, I think. You know, it's hard to tell. His doctors keep saying.... You know doctors. Mostly useless. Mostly, yeah. Tell dad that I.... I will. I gotta go. Savannah's spotted your escaped convict. Repeat that. We've got Kimble. Hold it! Don't jump! He's in the alley, heading north. Stop or I'll shoot! Let's go! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Clear the way! ...Dr. Richard Kimble, male Caucasian, 6 feet tall.... You've reached the Disability Benefit Claim Office... ...of Social Security. No one is available to take your call. Please leave your name and number, after the beep. This is Fred Johnson. You left me a message in Miami. I want to know where you got my name. My number is 9-1.... I'll call back. So, my brother calls me, leaves a voice-mail message... ...but he didn't leave his number. I was wondering, do you guys have a record or is there some way you can... ...find out what number he called from? Can I see that really quick? Boy, this really brings back memories. They sure made them to last. Who knew they didn't have to? So, you gonna upgrade? Yeah. Maybe. But that number that my brother called from? Right, technically, I mean really nitpicky, I'm not supposed to access your account. Some sort of legal thing. I mean, I can do it, it's just... ...the boss. So, you want to leave your number and I could get back to you? Sure. Can you come take a look at her? I've never seen her this bad. Is this the Parkinson's? I don't think so. Bree, can you hear me? Yeah. Did you take anything? Did you... - ...eat anything you're allergic to? - No. She's asleep. The fever's gone down. The swelling in her abdomen is gone. Has this happened before? The first time about a week ago. I thought she was getting better. I pulled out some of her old records... ...'cause of what you were saying the other day. These experiments some of these places are doing. Research hospitals, yeah. When she first got sick, we had a whole bunch of her records. Charts, doctors' statements, applications. I felt like there was a way, but... ...somewhere along the line she just... ...told me she just couldn't keep hoping like that. Can't blame her. She's the one who's sick. Plus, I didn't know what the hell I was doing half the time. You want some help filling out these applications? I know something about hospitals. What they're looking for in a candidate. Hell of a thing, all this, that we met. Now this? Makes me... ...ashamed. You love your wife. You'd do anything for her. You've nothing to be ashamed of. Come on. I'll teach you something about the ugly world of medical politics. Make everything simple. This will be fast. Mrs. Hume did nothing illegal in picking up that telephone and talking to her brother. Yeah, that's true. The crime starts here. My client made an early withdrawal and paid the penalty to the bank. Crime being? So what did you do with the money? I had to buy crack for the kids. You don't believe me? I believe you want what's best for your brother. And I believe you can help us bring him in. Alive. Tell me where he is. Lieutenant... ...you could take your gun, stick it in my mouth, cock the hammer... ...I wouldn't tell you what day it was. Well, then I guess we better get used to seeing more of each other. You know, all through the trial you were so sure. Like you just had to be right. And I kept wanting to ask you why? Why do you have to be right? And how are you gonna live with yourself... ...if they put that needle in my brother's arm... ...and you were wrong? Hey, baby. Oh hey. - So where's Alex? - She's 14 and it's Friday. What does that mean? She's locked in her room, on the phone. You want to hook up? Yeah. Come here. - Hello? - Mr. Davis? Yes? - Yeah, it's Floyd from-- - Floyd. - Have you got that number for me? - Yeah. - You got a pen? - Yeah. Go. The number is 912-555-0180. Floyd, thanks. When I make that upgrade, I owe you. Yes, you do. You've been taking it for about a week or so, huh? That's why you're cramping up, and your hair's falling out. You were doing it slow... ...hoping he wouldn't figure it out. I know what it's like... ...to want to give up. My body's closing in on me. Like a coffin. It won't walk or run. It won't dance or make love. This wasn't the life I'm supposed to have. What about Gary? My wife died. And if I could tell you... ...all the things that I feel everyday... ...because I know I'll never see her again... ...you wouldn't give up. You couldn't. Hi. Hi. I got those forms all finished up and ready to go. Should I... ...drop them in the mail? Magnolia Arms. Yeah. Fred Johnson's room, please. One moment. He's not answering. Magnolia Arms. Housekeeping, please. Housekeeping. This is Fred Johnson. Can I get some towels brought up to my room? He's waiting for a package. I'm not wanted. 911, what are you reporting? 911, what's your emergency? Help! He's trying to kill me! You can't kill me. If I die, you die. Get the hell out of there! Thanks. Bree! It's all right.
