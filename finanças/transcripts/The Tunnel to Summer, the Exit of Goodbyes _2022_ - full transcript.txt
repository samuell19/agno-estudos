- Hey, have you heard about that tunnel that will grant you any wish? - What are you talking about? - The rumour is, there's a torii gate at the back of the tunnel. And when you go through it... your wish comes true. But there's a catch... they say about a hundred years goes by while you're in there... - That's weird... What's the name of this tunnel? - The name of the tunnel is... Urashima Tunnel. That's so cool. Wow! - I would totally want money. Then I could buy whatever I wanted. - Yeah, well, there's nowhere to spend it out here in the boonies. - You're right. - After I graduate, I'm definitely moving to Tokyo. Cool! - Just now in Osara, in the front of the Sugamori Station, a minor collision occurred between a deer and a train. Because of this we're anticipating the next train will arrive about 30 minutes late. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience. Please wait a little while longer. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - You know it's creepy to just stare at people like that. - It's just that I haven't seen you around here, and... a lot of dear get hit by the train, so there's always delays. Here. My umbrella... - Hmm? - Wanna use it? - Why would I? - Because you don't have one... and I thought you might not want to get your bag wet. - Oh really? You a nice guy now? If I borrow it, then what would you do? Do you have another one? - Don't worry about me. My house is close to the next station. - You didn't answer my question. - It would suck if you caught a cold. You wouldn't want your parents to worry. - Yeah, what about your parents? - Well... I don't have anyone who worries about me. - Okay. I guess we have something in common. - Well there you go. - All right then. Can I borrow your umbrella? - Sure. - What's your name and phone number. - What? - I like to make sure I return what I borrow. So, I will be in touch. - Tono... Kaoru. - Hanashiro... Anzu. - Are you listening? I said to hurry up and return it. C'mon, don't make a scene, it's okay. - Okay, okay. All right, quiet please. We're starting homeroom. Also, I would like to introduce a new transfer student who will be joining our class. - What is it today... that they were coming? - This is Anzu Hanashiro, who came from Tokyo. Miss Hanashiro, an introduction, please. - I have nothing to say. - Huh? - May I go ahead and take a seat, please? - Uh... of course. - So, we're in the same class. Saves me the trouble of contacting you. I'll bring your umbrella tomorrow. - What's this about an umbrella? - Do those two know each other. - I don't know, maybe. - Let's talk to her during break. - Okay, everyone, let's get started, shall we? - Hey, Hanashiro, where exactly do you live? - Do you have any hobbies? - How does that have anything to do with all of you? - Ugh! - Hey, Hanashiro, what book are you reading? - Want to go to the cafe later? - Do you mind not talking to me? - Huh? - Hanashiro, wanna have lunch? - Let's eat together. - I already finished eating. - Huh? - Damn, impregnable fortress. - It makes her stand out. - Bet Kawasaki's gonna target her. - So what's your problem? Who do you think you are? - Nailed it. - You seem rather self-important for a transfer student. Are you like a princess who's come from the city or something? Hey! What's this? Manga? And it's old too! - Could you give it back? - I was wondering what kind of fine book you were reading while pretending to be- - Give it back. - Here you go. Sorry, I guess it just slipped out of my hands. It's an old manga, so maybe there was mold growing on it. The slimy kind! And I touched it! Ew! - You know... I think you are... picking a fight. - And if I am? - Damn! - Oh. - Hey! You're bleeding! This is bad! Go get the teacher! - Right. - I'll go too! - Why! Dammit! Piece of shit! - Shit. - Saying whatever the hell she wants. That old hag, is she messing with me? Huh? You're here? Why are you standing there? - Sorry, I'll get you some water. - Today at the town hall, that old hag who's kitty-corner from us came in, she said, "it's almost Karen's death's anniversary, right? I'll go pay my respects again." Does she thinks she's being a good person? That old hag. You think so too, right? - Yeah, sure. - "Yeah, sure!" To hell with that! What the hell are you being cocky for? It's all your fault, you know? You're the one who killed Karen! And all you do is listen to music with this stupid thing! Please bring Karen back to me... I'd rather have her than you anyway. Please just bring Karen back to this home. Where you going? Kaoru! - Ouch. What the... Huh? Amazing... What is this place? Karen? Why is... this here? Karen is... no longer... Huh? Karen! Karen! What... What the hell? A bird? A parakeet? Huh? The song of the frog... It can't be... Kii? But you're dead.... The Urashima Tunnel. This for real? No way. That song... The same one Karen and I taught you. Are you really... Kii? - What the...?! Is someone there? Kaoru... - You need something? Thank goodness. I didn't know what I was gonna do if I lost you too. Please forgive me. You see... I was just drunk before, that's all. So don't run away from home anymore. It was really tough, I was getting contacted by the school. - What? - Whose place were you staying at? You didn't do something like go into town and stay somewhere, right? - No, I stayed here. I was just out walking. - I see. You don't have to tell me, but if you stay away for a week again next time, I won't forgive you. - It's been a week? How's that? The 22nd? - Why were you absent for a whole week? - I caught the flu outta season and was contagious. - You could have at least called me or something dude. - Sorry, I forgot to charge my cell phone. - Idiot. - You showed up today. - I feel normal, so... - As long as you're not dead. - Yeah. - Will you be here tomorrow? - That's the plan. - Fine. Then I'll bring the umbrella. It's getting in my way. - She's showing concern, you know? - For whom? - For you, idiot! - Is this the Urashima Tunnel. This is not a dream. Karen... If I could get her back... Karen. Karen. - What is this place? - Huh? Hanashiro! - Tono, where- - Hurry! We gotta get out! Huh? Uh, hey! What are you doing? What's going on? What was that in there? - Huh? - You'll explain, right? I think I get it... A tunnel where the passage of time seems to be different than the outside. It was no more than a few seconds, but five hours passed out here. It feels like, when you're inside the world instantly leaves you. But in exchange, you can get any wish you want. So then, did you get the thing you wanted? - Not yet. But I have confirmation. - So, have you... told anyone else about this tunnel? - Of course not. There's no one who'd believe me if I just told them. - Yeah, I guess you have a point. Tono. - What's up? - How about we join forces? - Huh? - There's something that I want. And there's something that you want. If our objectives are the same, then doesn't it make sense that we figure out this tunnel together? I'm doing this for my sake. And you'll do it for your sake, and we'll get the things we want. So...? I don't think it's a bad proposition. I'm happy to work with you... Kaoru Tono. Our joint operation will begin today... are you sure that you're ready? - Of course. I was originally going to do this by myself anyway. But nevermind me, what about you? - I'm good to go. After school we'll meet up at the usual railroad crossing. And remember we absolutely cannot talk to anyone about the tunnel. This is a secret just between the two of us. - So, how do you think we should do this? - First, let's find out what the time lag is... so we know the difference between the inside and outside. Let's try to be accurate. - Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Then go ahead. Oh, one more thing... Make sure you keep talking to me. If there are time lags or we get disconnected, then that should be the point where there's a change in time. - What do I talk about? - That doesn't matter. Talk about anything. Just talk. Just talk. - Okay. At your previous school, did you hit someone? - Seriously? - You said it could be whatever, so... - No, I did not. I feel bad for Kawasaki, but she's the first person that I've hit. - If you feel bad, you should apologize. - Shouldn't the side who picked the fight in the first place be the one to do that? If I did apologize, it'd be after she said "sorry." - Yeah, that makes sense. - If you think about it, when something that you cherish is belittled, then being ang- - She's gone! - 65 minutes since we lost contact. - I turned back immediately, but one hour already passed? - So then...? Where'd the phones disconnect? - When I passed through the column of maples. - Hmm, I knew it. Just as I thought. Right.... let's keep on investigating then. We need to... in order for this tunnel to grant our wishes. - Turn back precisely three seconds after the column of maples. Three seconds is two hours. - That means at 30 seconds, that's 20 hours? - One hour is a hundred days. One day is... six and a half years. I'd like to find out if we can communicate between the inside and outside. Calling didn't work, but what about texts? - Did you get it? - I just got it. The time difference is the same as before. Since it's a tunnel, there should be an exit somewhere. Be careful! - Could you get off me? - Oh, sorry. - You've been with Hanashiro a lot lately, haven't you? - We just happened to end up together. - You guys going out? - Definitely not. - Is this really the bird that died? - It sings the same song I taught it. I'm pretty sure, I think. - So this is the confirmation you were talking about the other day? - Yeah. - Is it true that you had Hanashiro over at your house!? - There's no deep meaning to that. - Oh, it's deep, man! Like Mariana Trench deep! You're totally going out with her! - I said it's not like that, okay? - Do you think the tunnel has any connection to the town's spiritual climate or indigenous beliefs? - Let's look into it. - Maybe we can send texts from outside into the tunnel. We haven't done that yet, have we? - I sent from the inside, so we might be able to. - We'll send texts at the exact same time, so come back once you've received them. - Right. Anzu? What's happening? Anzu! Are you okay? - Hmm... Seven hours. You're late, Tono. But for you, that was only about 10 seconds, huh? - Sorry. - You didn't do anything wrong. No need to apologize. What about the text? - So they can't be delivered from the outside? - Well, I kind of got the sense it was like that. - Huh? Why? - Also... I don't recall ever saying it was okay to call me by my first name. - Sorry, it was a spur of the moment and without thinking I- - I don't really mind, so... - Right. We should head back now. It's gotten pretty late. - Hmm. A round trip of 108 seconds. And then the three day weekend is up. - Come on, let's hurry up and go! Hurry, hurry! - Tono! Did I keep you waiting? - Oh... No, actually, you're like right on time. - Punctuality is common sense. Let's go. - Why did you invite me to the aquarium? - Because this is probably the only notable place that's nearby. - I see. - Also... I find you appealing, Tono. - What? - Don't make this into something weird. It's not like I like you or anything. - Hey, Tono... you know you haven't laughed even once in front of me. - Is that so? - Yeah, it is. - You're fearless... or rather you laugh in a way like you're brimming with confidence. - I do? - Yeah. - That time... when you passed through the column... I was scared. It was like... this tunnel fractures the world. I got the feeling that no matter what I texted, it wouldn't get through to you... That's why I wanna make sure that we're communicating... as partners in this operation. - If you're scared, it's okay to quit. - There's no way I'm quitting. I'm gonna get the thing that I want most. You never know, I might just be able to get it next time. You have that same feeling too, don't you? - Mm-hm. A long time ago, I visited this aquarium... with my mother and father... and my sister, Karen. - You have a sister? - To my father and mother, she was a kid who was always kind. - Why was? - She fell out of a tree and she died. - What? - Karen was a kid who was always thinking of everyone's happiness. - Big Brother, what is it that you want? - Rhino beetle. - You can't catch those around here! For me, I want everyone to stay laughing. - She wished for a world where everyone would always be happy. But that day, Karen and I had a fight over a stupid thing and- - I hate everything about you! - I don't like you either. See ya. - I lied! I love you! Don't leave me! - By the time I got back, she had fallen from a tree and died. She fell while trying to catch a rhinoceros beetle for me. After that, my mother left us. My father started to drink a lot and abuse me. Our family was broken. - Tono, the thing you want... the thing you wish for... is it? - What I want... Is to bring Karen back to this world. Do I... Look scarier than the Urashima Tunnel? - Not at all. - What did you tell your parents? - We already covered this... I don't have parents. - That's right. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - We go and come back in 108 seconds. - That would get us back before the end of our three-day weekend, so we should be good. - Please don't trip this time. - Despite how I look, I do have good reflexes. We'll go with "ready, go..." Ready... Go! - Time's up, Hanashiro! Let's go back! Hanashiro! We have to return now! - Go on ahead! I'll catch up right after I pick these up. - I can't leave you! Forget it! - I can't leave these behind! - That's all of them! - Hanashiro, is that the thing you wished for? Is that what you wanted? - This is... This is the one and only thing that is connecting me to my grandpa. - It's four o'clock in the morning. If I go home now, I don't know what my father's gonna say. And I gotta do something about my clothes. - In that case... Wanna... come over? Wear this. - This belong to your father? - No, their my uncle's, this is his condo. He's away for a while, so he's letting me stay here. - By yourself? - I all ready told you, I don't have any parents. - This is incredible. Oh. Mitsuo Hanashiro. - Didn't mean to keep you- - Sorry, I didn't ask first. - Oh, that's okay. - So this Mitsuo Hanashiro is... - My grandfather. - This manga is the one that Kawasaki threw, isn't it? - Yes. And it is really precious to me, so that's why... - Hanashiro, those papers that came out of the tunnel, are they your grandfather's? If they're not his... Then it must be something you drew. How did- - I knew it. - How? Why would you think that? - That envelope there. That's the one you were holding onto the first time we met at the train station. Plus, Yuutousha is a famous publishing company, and if your grandfather is a manga artist and there's art supplies on your desk, then I you're probably an artist too. - You are right. They are my drawings. And that day, I was thinking of sending them in. - Why didn't you then? - How many manga artists do you think there are? - I don't know, like a thousand? - Try five thousand. And every year, there are more and more people who submit their work hoping to become famous artists. So everyday, my talent is tested. It's pretty frustrating, you know? That's why I didn't submit. - I get it, but you'll never know unless you try- - Look, that's just how things are, okay. For me... I loved whatever my grandpa drew... But my parents hated my grandpa for what he did... They didn't like him or his work. Do you know why? - Why? - Because it didn't sell at all. That manga... it's the only one of his that he ever got published. Just three volumes came out. Even still, he kept on drawing... to the point of borrowing from my father. When he died, my mother and father didn't shed a tear. If anything, it seemed like they were relieved. I guess they felt he was huge burden on them... So, when I said I wanted to be an artist like he had been... they totally banished me. - Is that the reason you moved here? - I'm not gonna change my mind just because I'm here. This is the first manga that I drew. And he's the only one who's read it. He loved it. You see, he taught me the joy of being an artist. But one day my father found it, and threw it away. He said, "so you wanna be poor like your grandpa?" And he ripped it into pieces. This is that manga. Have you ever heard of Mitsuo Hanashiro? - I'm sorry, I haven't. - It's okay. There was a time when I'd go to bookstores searching for his work to be somewhere on the shelf, but I never found one copy. You couldn't find his manga anywhere because he was just too obscure and no one knew him. That made me realize... that if I want to be a famous artist, I need to have something extraordinary. - Hanashiro, the thing that you want, is it... - What I need to become someone special is talent. With that, I can create a manga that makes a mark on the world. - Hanashiro, the Urashima Tunnel- - What?! Are you trying to say it doesn't grant that kind of wish or something? Even though you yourself are trying to get your sister back? - No. Hanashiro, would you... let me read it? - Huh? No way. - Why not? - Because I'm not satisfied with it. The story and all the characters... That's why I couldn't submit it. - But you drew in order for someone to read it, right? - If I'm not satisfied with it, I can't let other people see it. - But if you don't let anyone read it, then it will just end up being pieces of paper. - Shut up! Are you picking a fight? This has nothing to do with you. - But haven't we... entered into a joint operation? - It's nothing special. All you'll find out is that it's ordinary. - You'll never know if it's good or not, unless you let me read it. This is good. Despite the complex storyline, I never got confused. The way you used foreshadowing is crazy and I loved the surprise at the end. Is it okay if I read it one more time? - Thanks. I'm glad. - Yeah. - But there are like 50,000 people who can draw better than me. I know how hard this industry is. And that's why I need to be exceptional. like something that lets you carve out living proof... That kind of talent. - But you're already amazing. You have more than enough talent to become a great artist. You're special, even if you don't go into- - It's the opposite. Complete opposite. It's you who is special. I found that out that time at the aquarium. It's you, you're in a different world than other people. I was forced to realize the things I'm thinking about are trivial and average at best. - What's that mean, though? - Tono, in order to make your wish be fulfilled, you can sacrifice everything without hesitation. I think that's why maybe the Urashima Tunnel found you. - You're giving me too much credit, I'm just a normal- - I wanna go to the world where you are, Tono. That's why I need that tunnel. Hey, Tono... Please help me see the world that you see. - But my world is dreary. - That's not bad either. Next time, you're gonna keep going until you find Karen, right? - Yeah. I'm not leaving until I do. - Me either. I will not go back until I get what I want. We'll continue? - August 2nd. I've decided for us. - Kaoru! - Huh? I'm going to the summer festival next week with Sugisaki, you want to come too? - Uh, I... - Oh, are you already going with Hanashiro? Sorry, my bad. I'm telling you, Hanashiro and I- That might not be a bad idea. Sorry, did I keep you waiting? - Not really. You're early as well. It wasn't time to meet yet. - I get to places ten minutes early. - You're beyond serious. - Uh... Shall we go. - Mm-hm. - After this, we will start the fireworks display. It's held on the south side of the venue- - That sign... Did you see it? It says "no trespassing." - It's a little known spot that Karen and I found when the two of us came here a long time ago. - Why did you invite me here? - Because I don't know when we might come back. It might be a thousand years later. - Hmm. At that time, it'll just be the three of us; me, you, and Karen. - Do you think manga will still be around? - Drawings and stories have been a part of this world from the very beginning of time. There's no way that manga will ever disappear. - Great, that's good to hear. - Is it alright to ask why you went with August 2nd? - The day I came here with Karen... my parents had a huge fight. It was like the two of us were trying to run away from home. Karen was being her usual happy self, but... she was crying. August 2nd is the anniversary of Karen's death. Huh. - Come on! - Yeah, you got me! I'm done for! - This sushi was expensive, wasn't it? - Aw, don't worry about it. - Oh... But I'm happy. - Ah, shucks. Now, let's get down to eating. Yeah? - Mm-hm. Oh, there's someone here. - Huh? What? You're home? But it's still so early. Come here. This is him. This is my boy, Kaoru. - Oh, so you're the son. Hi, nice to meet you. - Come on... introduce yourself. Guess what? This person is going to be your new mother. Huh? What does that... - I intended to talk to you about it. But, well... work was really busy... and we always seemed to have terrible timing. Sorry to rush things, but this is how it is. Come on, it's just a little celebration. We should drink to it. - I thought they found some issues during your check up? - Well, today is a special day. Kaoru, one more thing. I have plans for us to move out of here. I've decided we'll leave and live in Tokyo. And I'm interviewing for a new job. - I hope it works out. - From here on out, I'm gonna have a completely new life- - Huh? - What's wrong, Kaoru? Why are you crying? What?! Damn! Kaoru! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Where are you going? The song of the frog... We can hear it... The song of the frog... We can hear it... - Huh? - This cafe has a nice atmosphere. - It's been here a while. When I was a little kid, I used to come here. - Do you know if you're able to play games on this table? - You can. It's a hundred yen. - I'll try it later, then... maybe. - What's going on? - Remember the manga I let you read the other day at my place? I sent it to Yuutousha after you left. I finished it and it was pretty difficult. It was meant to be like a tribute to him, I didn't expect anything. - Mm-hm. - Today, there was a call from the magazine editor. Apparently, they seemed to like what I sent... and they asked me if I wanted to create more for them. - Will it be published? - No. I just get an editor assigned. Nothing's been decided beyond that. - I don't know much about the manga business, but doesn't that mean someone's discovered you? - Well, that's... It's most likely not that big of a deal. I think they're just calling dibs right now. Maybe to protect their self-interest. - Hanashiro, you know- - Thank you for waiting. Here's your assorted sandwiches... and one omelet rice. Take your time and enjoy. - That's all there is to tell. Nothing more. But more importantly, tomorrow is the day we're entering the tunnel. Have you prepared everything? - Let's... postpone. - Why is that? - I think you should really think about it. - I did think! And I chose to enter the tunnel with you. - If that's the case, there was no need to tell me about this, right? - The way you just said that is totally irritating. - Sorry, but this is an important decision. The truth is, you're still unsure about this, aren't you? - No, I'm- I'm not. It's no good if I don't change. I have no confidence. That's why I have to become someone special. I'm sorry. I just don't know what the correct decision is to make here. - Let's just eat, okay? No need to make a decision like this on an empty stomach. - Just now in Kawagata, in front of the Osara station, a minor collision occurred between a deer and a train. Because of this, we are anticipating the next train will arrive about 30 minutes late. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience. Please wait a little while longer. - I've never seen you around here. The train being late because of a deer happens a lot more often than you might think. - What? - My umbrella... wanna use it? - Uh... This is so not me. And why would I need it? - Because you don't have one. And you don't wanna get your bag all wet. - Oh, really? So you're a nice guy now? If I borrow your umbrella, then what're you going to do? - My house is pretty close to the next station. - You didn't answer my question. - But wouldn't your parents worry if you caught a cold? - I was abandoned by my parents. - Well, there you go... All I have is my shitty old man at my house. - Is it okay if I borrow it? - Sure. - Tell me your name and give me your cell number. - Kaoru Tono. - Anzu Hanashiro. - Your face, Tono... It's not bad when you laugh. - The same goes for you. - Oh, that's right... I have to return the umbrella I borrowed. Things were so busy that I forgot. - You can throw it away. It's a cheap umbrella. - I return what I borrow. Plus, you never know when you might need it, right? - That's true. - Are you a friend of Kaoru's? I'm sorry to tell you, but he left the house last night and hasn't come back. As to where he went, I don't know, but that happens occasionally so don't make- Uh... Dammit. - Tono... Tono... Tono! Tono! Tono! Tono! Tono! Huh? Huh? - By the time this message gets delivered, I'll have advanced to some extent into the tunnel. You may be angry or you may be disappointed in me... And just maybe it might be both of those. But you should never have a reason to enter the tunnel. Though you were saying you wanted special talent... I think you already have that. The manga you let me read was awesome... and the fact you received an offer from an editor means... that people think you're special. I want to read Anzu Hanashiro's incredible stories. Even more of your short stories or serialized manga. And that's why I want you to keep drawing. I need to tell you the truth about the Urashima Tunnel. The tunnel where they say you can get anything you want. That is a lie. The Urashima Tunnel is... The Urashima Tunnel is a place where you can get back the things you've lost. That's why even if you went in, you wouldn't gain the talent you think you need. I have no choice but to enter the tunnel by myself. Hanashiro... you must become a great artist and leave a deep impression in the world you're in. Even if I were to come out one thousand years later, I want to be able to read your stories. This joint operation we had going was really fun. That's why for now... - Seriously? No! You coward! All you were thinking about was yourself, you totally don't get me at all! Trying to act all cool now! Going by yourself without saying anything! What happened to our freak'n joint operation!? You don't just break it on your own! Do you know how... I was feeling? How I was feeling? If it was... was with you, Tono? I thought it'd be fine to completely abandon this world. - Fourteen and a half hours. That'd be four years on the outside, huh? Karen? Karen? Where are you? Karen... Show me. Huh? - Oh, wow. Hey. - Karen? - Yeah? - Is that banana juice you have? - Bingo! You want some?! - I had a really weird dream. - 'Kay... What was it? - Hmm... I forgot. - You forgot your dream? I always remember my dreams! The other day, I dreamt that we caught 100 Hercules beetles like it was nothing! - What? Lucky. - Oh yeah, that's right! Wait right here! Look, look! A rhino beetle! I knew you wanted one, so I got one for you! - Awesome! - Isn't it big? - Where did you find it? - A secret? - Come on, tell me! - If I tell you, you'd get them, wouldn't you? - Was I obvious? - So obvious. Oh, I'll make dinner later, okay? - You? - Yeah! I can cook it for you. - What are you gonna make? - Huh? Let's see. Instant udon and... Onigiri! I'm gonna make it in the microwave! - Ugh, great... You really call that cooking? - Absolutely! I mean I'm the one who's adding the hot water. And the one who's microwaving the onigiri... and I'm the one putting them on plates. See! I am making them! Aw, you spilled it! I'll go get a rag! - What is this place? Not things that were lost... things that were thrown away. But how? I thought I couldn't get texts from the outside... Hanashiro... - Is that a friend of yours? - No... Not anymore. - Why? Did you have a fight or something? - It's not like that, but... - It's not good to fight with a friend. Plus, you really don't have a lot of friends. - It's fine... as long as I have you. - I know, right! And I know that you really love me! That's why I can laugh in front of you without any worry. Because I love you too, Big Brother. - And I love you, Karen. - But I also want you to go out there and fall head over heels for someone. - I, um- - Because then... if the person you fell in love with loves you too, Brother... then the three of us can laugh together! - I want... to stay here with you... But right now... There's a girl I need to see! - I know! I love you, Big Brother! Take care! - I'm headed out. - Hmm? - Miss Hanashiro, I have to leave now so I can catch the last train. - Ah. Thank you for your hard work. - I'll be in tomorrow at 10am. - 'Kay, I'll see you then. - Thanks. Have a good night. - Are you ever gonna let me return your umbrella? - Hanashiro! Hanashiro. Hanashiro! Hanashiro! Hanashiro! I want... There's something I need to tell you! - Maybe you should take a little break right now. You've had great success ever since your debut... You'll be able to draw again. - I'm really sorry about this. - Hey... why do you carry that old umbrella? Is it a good luck charm or something? - This is... - Listen... I can take care of everything for awhile, so please don't worry. You just need to take some time and get some rest. - Right. - Just now in Osara, in front of the Tsugemori station, a minor collision occurred between a deer and a train. Because of this, we are anticipating the next train will arrive about 30 minutes late. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience. Please wait a little while longer. - I... Tono, I want to tell you I have always... Always... Tono. Tono. Tono! - Hanashiro? - Mm-hm. It's been eight years. - Why are you... in here? - You were gone too long, I had to come get you. - Even though I said goodbye? - The joint operation isn't over for us. - I sent you a text... and then I tripped. - I received it. - What? - I received it. - Sorry, you waited. At ten seconds, that was a six and a half hour kiss. 13 years... - And 102 days. - I bet a lot of things have changed. - Well, not really. I mean, it's not like it's been a thousand years. - Funny. And it looks like I'll be able to read your book. - Yeah? How'd you know about that? - I received your texts. Even though they weren't supposed to get delivered, but it was only your texts. - Maybe you were able to get them... because you lost me. It's raining. - My umbrella. You kept it this whole time? - I can finally return it. So, I guess that makes us both even. - Although it took 13 years. - And 102 days. We can think about that from here on. - From here on. Hana- - Tono- - Let's go.
