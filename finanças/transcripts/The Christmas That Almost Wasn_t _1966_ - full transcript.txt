Prune. (gentle upbeat music) - Where's the snow you promised us Mr. Whipple? - Well, a person can be wrong. It's sure to snow by Christmas. - Yeah, but you promised us snow today. - Huh? Well so I did. Well, here maybe this'll hold you for awhile. - [Kids] Yay! (kids applauding) - Now, where do we start? Come on everybody, pitch in. That tree's too big for one fellow. All right, here we go. Up the ladder! Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up! I tell you something, when we're finished with this tree it's going to be the most beautiful tree in the whole wide world. Careful now, first one to drop one's a monkey. (kids laughing) Now, how does that look? - Looks fine Mr. Whipple but the way you're fastening everything down you must be expecting Christmas to last the whole year 'round. - Imagine, Christmas in springtime. Wouldn't the Easter Bunny be surprised? - Hey Mr. Whipple, how 'bout Christmas in summertime? - Hm, not a bad idea. Let's see. Swimming in the afternoon, fireworks at night. You know something Davey, the more I think of your idea the better I like it. - But that wasn't my idea, I-- - All those in favor of having Christmas every day raise your right hands and say I. - [Kids] I! - But that's impossible Mr. Whipple. Christmas is only supposed to last one day. - Well Davey, maybe that's because nobody ever thought of making it last any longer. * Why do people always make the same mistake * * Why do they let Christmas slip away * * What a lovely change * If we could arrange * For Christmas Day to come and stay * * And never ever go away * Why can't everyday be Christmas * * Why can't everyday be gay * Why can't everyday be Merry Christmas * * Each and everyday * No need to wait until December * * It's always Christmas in your heart * * Just as long as you remember * Friends must never ever part * So let each day be Merry Christmas * * Don't let that feeling get away * * Let's make each day a Merry Christmas * * And life a great big holiday * Why can't everyday be Christmas * * Why can't everyday be gay * Why can't everyday be Merry Christmas * * Each and every day (kids chattering) (upbeat gentle music) (Mr. Whipple whistling) - Mr. Whipple? (Mr. Whipple whistling) Mr. Sam Whipple? - Hm? That's me all right. Oh Sir, would you mind handing me that ball? Thank you, Sir (whistling). I must be seeing things. Excuse me Sir, I hope you're not gonna laugh at me but if I didn't know any better I'd say you was Santa Claus. You certainly look like him. - I am Santa Claus and I'm not laughing. - That's what I thought. I'd have recognized you sooner if it hadn't been for that sad look on your face. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you are Santa what are you doing here? You're early. Aren't you supposed to be up at the North Pole getting the presents ready for the children? - Christmas is not coming this year. - What? Not coming? Who's gonna stop it from coming? - Mr. Phineas T. Prune and he's just the fellow who can do it too. - Did you say Prune? Phineas T. Prune, the multi zillionaire with the pickle face who lives in that big grouchy house over there? But why? What's got into him so suddenly? - It isn't sudden at all. He's been out to ruin me and stop Christmas for many a long year now. - Why should he do a thing like that? There's got to be a reason. - Children. He doesn't like children. He wants me to stop giving presents to children. - Santa, you couldn't do that. - Oh, you know me better than that Mr. Whipple. Besides, if I stop giving presents to children, there'd be no reason for me at all would there? But this time he's got me. I'm licked for sure. - Oh come on Santa, don't talk like that. - [Jim] Good evening Counselor. - Oh, good evening Jim. - Well, the town certainly look Christmas-y doesn't it? - Yes, it certainly does. (Jim chuckles) - I'm going off duty now. I'm going home to help the kids write their letters to Santa Claus. Would you like them to send Santa your regards? - Yes, you do that Jim. We're old friends Santa and I. Good night. Good night, Jim. - Goodnight. - Come on Santa, let's talk this over in my office. We wouldn't want people seeing you around this early. - He called you Counselor, Sam. Are you a lawyer or something? - That's me, Sam Whipple, Counselor and Attorney at Law. Now tell me, what's our pickle faced friend got up his sleeve this year? - Well, years ago the Eskimos very generously gave Mrs. Santa and myself some land up at the North Pole rent free. But then last year, Mr. Prune came up and bought the whole North Pole, including our little plot of land. - You mean he's your landlord now? - That's it Sam, that's it exactly. And I owe him a year's rent and we haven't got the money to pay it. - Oh, I see. So it's either you pay the rent, or out you go? - Oh, I wouldn't mind that. Mrs. Santa and I could manage somehow. - Sit down, sit down. - Thank you. It's the toys. (chair creaking) - Oh, I'm sorry! - It's the toys you see. The Christmas presents I'm worried about. If we don't pay him then Mr. Prune will take all the presents as payment. - So that's his scheme. No presents, no happy children, no happy anyone, no Christmas. Nice fella Mr. Prune. (chair creaking) (Sam chuckles) (Santa grunts) I'm sorry. Here, use my chair. - Thank you. (chair creaking) - When's the rent due Santa? - Christmas Eve at midnight. - Doesn't leave you much time does it? - That's why I came all the way down here to find you. - Why me? I'm nobody special. - Years ago when you were a little boy, you wrote me a letter. - So did a million other children. - That's very true, but you see Sam, you're the only child who wrote me a letter after Christmas. You spelled thank you with two K's. (Sam laughs) - I did? You know I'd forgotten about that (chuckles). - Well, I didn't forget. You even put in a P.S. - "Dear Santa, "If you ever need anything please call on yours truly. "Samuel Whipple, Esquire." - Well Sam, I'm calling on you now if you don't mind. I'm in trouble. - How much do you owe Santa? - Oh, no I couldn't. - Now, now, now, come on Santa. I'm a lawyer and lawyers don't like to lose arguments. How much? - Well, here's the rent bill. (bill rustling) (Sam whistles) - That much? Hm. (Sam whistling) (Sam chuckles) Hm. Now don't get me wrong Santa, I'm really a good lawyer. I just keep forgetting to send out bills. (door clinks) I'm sorry Santa but I'm afraid it's a little too steep for me. We're going over to have a little chat with Mr. Prune and tell him a thing or two. - You'll never get in to see him. - Oh, I'll get in all right. I'd like to see him stop me. Come on. Don't you worry about a thing. (dog barking) Nice, nice, nice doggy! (Sam knocking) (dog barking) (locks clinking) (dog barking) Good evening Mr. Prune. You're not Mr. Prune are you? - No. - Uh, yes I see. Well, nice evening isn't it? - Well, don't just stand there. State your business. - Business? Oh yes, of course uh, Mr. S. Claus and Mr. S. Whipple to see Mr. P. Prune. - He's not in. - But I-- - He's not in. - Well-- - I said he's not in. - Why isn't he in? - Because (sniffles), he's out. (dog barking) - Santa, we're just gonna sit right here and wait for Mr. Prune. (Santa sputters) (dog barking) Oh. Even if it takes all night. - We'd better wait at my house. - Your house? - That's where he shows up every evening at suppertime to ask for the rent money. He says it gives him the greatest pleasure to spoil our appetites. - Well then Santa, come on! Let's head for the North Pole. - Oh, I do wish Santa would come. I'm so worried. (gentle music) But I really mustn't worry must I? Santa said not to worry. * La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la * * La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la * * Da da da da da da da da * La la la la la la la la la la * * La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la * Not a sound. Not one single solitary sound. (playful music) (gentle music) Well, I declare, I really must declare, not a lick. Not a stitch of work being done. What will Santa think? - What's the use of making toys if Mr. Prune is gonna get 'em all? - Ah, so that's it. Now don't you worry your dear little heads. Santa's gone to see a friend about that. Everything's going to be all right. Don't you fret. Come on now, back to work everybody. Just keep saying to yourself... * Christmas is coming * Christmas is coming * Christmas is coming * Twill soon be here * Christmas is coming * Christmas is coming * Christmas Day, it will soon be here * Good boys. (upbeat music) * Helter, skelter, hustle, bustle * * Hurry, scurry, hippety-hop * And never shilly shally dilly dally * * Fiddle faddle, flippety flop - But supposing Christmas doesn't come? * Shilly, shally, dilly, dally * Fiddle, faddle, flippety, flop * * Why should we helter, skelter, hustle, bustle * * Hurry, scurry, hippety-hop - But Christmas will come. (upbeat music) (sleigh grinding) Santa's home. - Let me give you a hand. We'll get you warmed up quickly enough. (sleigh bells ringing) (wind howling) - That was quite a ride. I'm still not sure I believe it. - Just a short hop. I do it all the time. Fun isn't it? - Uh huh, great fun. (Santa knocking) (wind howling) - Oh Santa, you did it again. How many times do I have to tell you not to come down so fast? - Now, now Mother. We have a guest. This is Sam Whipple and Mother, he's a lawyer. - Oh good. - This is a great pleasure Mrs. Claus. - My pleasure. Why the poor young man is frozen. Oh the poor dear. Santa, aren't you ashamed of yourself? Dragging Mr. Whipple up to the North Pole without so much as a fur coat? - [Santa] But Mother I-- - Oh, declare you men are all children. Everyone of you. Put my shawl around you. A nice cup of tea will fix you up just fine. - Thank you. (fire crackling) - My Santa, such a fine looking gentlemen. Reminds me of you when you were young (laughs). (Santa laughs) - You flatter me Mrs. Claus. - Santa, I haven't heard you laugh in ever so long. Does that mean that everything is going to be all right? Christmas really is coming? Oh, I'm so glad. - Now, now Mother, not so fast. We hope so but we're not sure yet. Sam here will speak to Mr. Pune, and then we shall see. - Now that's the best cup of tea I have ever tasted. All right Mr. Prune wherever you are, I'm ready for you now. (Santa's helpers cheering) - Gouda. - Oh you naughty scamps. Skat, skat. (playful music) (head thuds) (playful music) - By the way, where is Mr. Prune? I thought he'd be here by now. - Probably waiting outside for us to start supper. I'll show you. Well, Mother, is supper ready? - [Mrs. Claus] Piping hot and ready to serve. - Psst, Mother I repeat. Well Mother, is dinner ready? - Piping hot and ready to serve. (Mr. Prune knocking) - [Santa] What did I tell you? He just loves to spoil our suppertime. - Well I'm ready for him if you are. - Good luck Sam, dear. Come in Mr. Prune. (wind howling) What a surprise. - Greetings (chuckles), from an old friend. - Oh, Mr. Prune you've done it again. - What? What have I done? - Gone out into this cold weather without your galoshes. What you need Mr. Prune is someone to take care of you. - Nonsense! Poppycock. - Ah, men are such children. - Children! Oh, that word. I feel faint. Madam, I shall hold you personally responsible if I have bad dreams tonight. - Mr. Prune, isn't that rather childish? - Please! Please! Please. Have you ever tried to go to sleep counting children jumping over a fence? Yes, children. Children, kids, children. (door latches) (pensive music) I've been running away from children all my life. (door latches) (pensive music) From one country to another and you can't escape them. The world is full of children. (Mr. Prune groans) * Life I just one great frustration * * When I see all through the nation * * Children spoiled by adulation * * Why won't someone spoil me too * * How I view with indignation * Doting parents adoration * Of their children's conversation * * No one says I'm clever too * It is really most upsetting * To see people always petting * Children who are always getting * * In my hair * They're everywhere * It isn't fair * Kids get all the breaks * They never do a thing * But everybody always sings their praises * * Kids get all the breaks * Oh, for heaven's sakes * I'd rather they would all go to blazes * * Kids get all the breaks * No matter what they say * They're always told their eloquence amazes * * Kids get all the breaks * Oh, the little fakes * With pretty please * Doo-doo, goo-goo * And all the silly faces * Kids live a life of ease * Grownups tremble when they sneeze * * I tell you kids have got me in a stew * * Why don't they grow up * And fend for themselves * The way we grownups have to do * * Kids get all the breaks * They're just a bunch of fakes * * Please understand I know what I am saying * * Kids get all the breaks * I say they're all mistakes * For which we grownups have to keep on paying * * And paying, and paying * The price we grownups have to keep on paying * - Poor, poor Mr. Prune. You're all upset. Now, you sit down and we'll have a nice cup of tea to quiet your nerves. - Madam, I'll thank you to keep your kindness to yourself. Now then to business. Have you got the money for the rent? - But Mr. Prune, it isn't time yet. - Don't quibble. Very well then, when will you have the money? - [Sam] Mr. Prune, I want to-- - Oh, this is Mr. Sam Whipple, our lawyer. - Thank you, Santa. Now then Mr. Prune-- - Lawyer, huh? (Mr. Prune chuckles) I've never met a lawyer I couldn't handle. - Now see here Mr. Prune-- - Haven't I seen you around town? What's your name again? Uh, Ripple, Dripple, Whiffle, Phiffle? - Whipple! Now see here Mr. Prune. - You are waiting your time, Sir. I've got my legal rights, I have. The North Pole belongs to me lock, stock, barrel. Full of bears, walruses and ice. It's mine. Mine. I bought it. And Ordinance Number 614 of the Housing Code says and I quote, "If tenants do not pay their rent money, "landlord shall have the right "to take possession of all their possessions "in full payment and furthermore--" - And furthermore Mr. Prune you're going to sit right down in that chair and listen for a change. (Santa's helpers cheering) - Shh, shh! - Silence! (gavel banging) Silence, silence, silence! (gavel thuds) - Money. Money. Money, that's all this man seems to think about. Mr. Phineas T. Prune. Thinks money, talks money, eats money, smells money. Mr. Phineas middle initial T. Prune! That T wouldn't stand for tightwad by any chance would it? - I object! - Objection overruled. - [Santa's Helpers] Hurrah! - Silence, silence! (gavel banging) Silence! - All right Mr. Prune. What were you going to say? - You can't call me a tightwad. I am no miser. Money doesn't mean a thing to me. I just don't like to waste it, that's all. What are you driving at anyway? - Just this Mr. Prune. If money means so little to you, then why insist that these dear, good, sweet people pay the rent when you know they have no money? And if you throw them out of this house, where will they go? What will they do? And if they catch cold, will that mean anymore money in your pockets? No Mr. Prune. I still insist that T must stand for tightwad. - No it doesn't. - [Santa's Helpers] Yes it does! - No it doesn't. - [Santa's Helpers] Yes it does! - No it doesn't! - Very well then, prove it. - Yes, but I must have time to think. - Take all the time you need. (playful music) - I've got it! - Silence-- - Shh! - Mr. Claus, I don't want you to think that I have anything against you personally. Far from it. You never harmed me. Why should I want to harm you? And all for a few measly dollars. How ridiculous. Mr. Whipple's eloquence touched me deeply right here. - Oh, what a sweet man you are. - Madam, I'll thank you to keep your compliments to yourself. Now where was I when I was so rudely interrupted? - Something touched you here. - Oh, yes. I am deeply touched here. Therefore I have decided, that you do not have to pay me the rent. Not one single solitary penny. - [Santa's Helper] Hooray! - But there is one condition Mr. Claus. - Name it Mr. Prune, name it. It's done. - You must promise never again to give Christmas presents to children. Well, now that's settled I'll bid you all a good evening. - Wait, just a moment Mr. Prune. I can't make that promise. I won't stop giving Christmas presents to children. I don't want to. - Then out into the freezing cold you will go. Oh, come now Mr. Claus. Don't you think you are taking all this too seriously? You would give up this snug, warm, cozy little house for children? Children? What do they ever give you in return? - Love. - Ah. - That's what Christmas is all about Mr. Prune. - But you keep spoiling the brats. Giving, giving, giving. - So that someday Mr. Prune they'll learn to give too. - Ah, poppycock. Bosh, twaddle and bah. Well? You are his lawyer. Tell him he's a stubborn old fool. - Well, I happen to disagree. I think he's kind of nice. But as for you Mr. Prune I think you are just about the meanest man I have ever met. - Do you really? Oh, thank you, thank you very much indeed. It's very kind of you to say so. I pride myself on my meanness. * Oh * I am good, I'm very good * I'm good at being bad * Don't be surprised * Just realize all the practice I have had * * I suppose I could be very good * * But that would make me sad * Right from the first * I've been the worst * A super naughty lad * How bad * So bad * Not good * Just bad * How sad * I'm glad * I'm glad you're sad I'm bad * I'm glad you're here * So glad to have some company * It's sad but I am scared to be alone with me * * When I look into a mirror * I just cover my eyes * I can't stand the sight of me * * You're bad * I'm glad * Not good * But bad * How sad * I'm glad * I'm glad you're sad I'm bad * Had * Who * You * True * Sad * Glad * I'm glad * I'm glad * I am bad - Please Mr. Prune, don't take Christmas away from us. Think of what this will do to the children. It will break their hearts. - Good. Good. - Mr. Prune, weren't you ever a child yourself? (Mr. Prune choking) - Really? I didn't come to this house to be insulted! - I'm sorry Mr. Prune but it's time we faced facts. You must've been a child. - Please! - Don't you see, you just had to be a child. - Never! - [Santa's Helpers] Never, never, never! - Never! Why, prove it. I dare you to prove it. Nobody can prove it. And now I think I've waisted enough valuable time. Either you have the money by midnight December 24th or no Christmas! (pensive music) (wind howling) (cane clattering) (ominous playful music) (wind howling) - I wonder why that poor man wouldn't admit he ever was a child. - Yes, that did seem funny. Wait a minute, I think you've got something there Mrs. Santa. Mr. Prune is hiding something. But what? Now, if we could only prove that he was a child once, I've got a hunch we could make him see things differently. But how could we do that? - Wait a minute, maybe I can help. You know of course I keep a record of every child that ever was. Why didn't I think of that before? Jonathan? - Yes Santa? - Can you remember anything about a child named Phineas Prune? - Prune? Phineas Prune? Hm. Oh, him! Hm, no. - Phineas T. Prune. Does that help? - Hm, hm. Prune, Phineas T. Prune? Doesn't strike a spark somehow. - Well, you look him up in your records. There can't be too many Prune's in this world. - How do you spell it? - P-R-U-N-E. - That's what I though, Prune. All right men, let's get the books down and look for a Prune. - Hurrah! (playful music) * If Christmas came in June * We'd say good afternoon * We don't care if it all makes sense * * The name of the song is Prune * * Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune * Prune, spoon, moon, June * Prune, Prune, Prune, spoon - [Apricot] Apricot? - No, Prune! * We had a pet raccoon * Ate donuts with a spoon * We don't care if it all makes sense * * The name of the song is Prune * * Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune * Prune, spoon, moon, June * Prune, Prune, Prune, spoon - Lemon? - [Jonathan] No, Prune. * There was a big baboon * Who never sang in tune * We don't care if it all makes sense * * The name of the song is Prune * * Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune * Croon, spoon, moon * June, Prune, croon, Prune, spoon * - Crab apple? - No, Prune! * We blew up a balloon * It turned into the moon * We don't care if it all makes sense * * The name of the song is Prune * * Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune * Croon, spoon, moon, June * Prune, croon, Prune, spoon - [Spinach] Spinach? - No, I told you Prune! Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune. - Now you mustn't get your hopes up too high. It may take Jonathan days, weeks, even months to find anything. And even if he does it may not do any good. So, I figured out a plan which may just do the trick. Santa, you and I are going to go to work. We're going to find us a job, and earn the money to pay the rent. Come on! (wind howling) (playful music) - Keep working, I'll get some tea for you. (playful music) A job? Who would ever hire Santa Claus? (playful music) - [Sam] I'm looking for a job. - [Mr. Prim] I'm sorry young man, but there are no positions available at this time. - [Sam] But Sir, won't you let me explain? You see, I have... (playful music) - [Mr. Prim] No! - [Sam] But Sir, you don't understand. My friend and I... (playful music) - [Mr. Prim] Now stay out and don't come back. - No Mr. Prim. I'm not gonna let you miss the opportunity of a lifetime. It wouldn't be fair to you. Please, please give me just one moment. Just one little moment. - All right, but hurry. (gentle music) Oh, my. (gentle music) Turn around, turn around my good man. That's right. - I don't understand. - Let me do the talking. - It's remarkable. It's truly remarkable. Why, he looks just like Santa Claus. (Sam chuckles) Your own? - But I am Santa-- - Yes, it is a remarkable coincidence isn't it Mr. Prim? - Incredible. Congratulations my dear man, you're hired. - But Sam, I still don't understand. - Ah, ah, ah, oh, this is Mr. Prim. He owns this department store, Prim's Department Store. - How do you do, Sir? - And my name is Sam Whipple. - Yes, yes, of course. Let me see. Now if I understand this plan correctly, if the parents wish their children to meet Santa Claus, they are to bring them here to Prim's Department Store. A mild deception of course since we know there really is no Santa Claus. - [Sam] What? - My dear young man your idea is positively revolutionary. Why, if it works, if it works, our toy department will sell more toys than all the other stores put together. And this gentlemen, Santa, I hope you don't mind my calling you that. - Well, of course not. I am Santa. - Is he going to be all right? I mean to say he really seems to be suffering from some sort of hallucination. - No, he's just living the part you might say. - Oh, an unemployed actor. Well, as I was uh, saying, you Sir, you'll be sitting a throne. Oh, we'll get something from somewhere and then you'll speak to the children, yes? And you'll ask them their age and so on and-- - You mean you call that a job just being myself? - That's right Santa and you get paid for it too. - Enough to pay the rent? - Well, no but perhaps Mr. Prim can find a job for me too and between us we can make enough to pay the rent. - Is he going to make you president of the store? - No, janitor. - Janitor? - That's right my boy. Start at the bottom, that's my motto. - Now, how shall I make my spectacular announcement? (fingers snapping) (upbeat music) I've got it. All right men. Haul it up. Heave! Heave! (upbeat music) I can hardly wait to see Mr. Macy's face when he sees that. Matter of fact I think I'll go over and tell him right now. All right gentlemen, busy little bees, busy little bees. Good morning. - [Woman] Morning. (upbeat music) - Late as usual. - Sorry Mr. Prim. (upbeat music) - Morning. - Morning. - Come on Santa, we gotta get to work. (upbeat music) Look, you're throne has come. You'd better practice before the kids come rushing in. - Practice? Me practice? (Santa laughs) (gentle music) I know children like a book. I've lost count of all the children I've seen fast asleep in their beds. That funny little smile on their faces while they're dreaming. The way they curl themselves around a pillow, the way they sing to themselves. - But Santa, these children aren't going to be asleep. They'll be wide awake. - Awake? - Why, Santa what's the matter? - Awake. Awake did you say? - (chuckles) Santa, you're blushing. - You see, the fact of the matter is, in all my years I've never seen on single child wide awake. They've always been fast asleep. - Well, what do you know? - You can't go around waking up children in the middle of the night. May I tell you something? * I have been around the world * More times than you can count * * And do you know that I have yet to see * * A child who's wide awake * I wish that for my sake * Just once they'd stay awake * Just long enough to say hello to me * * I know that parents say Santa Claus will stay away * * If children are not fast asleep in bed * * I wish they'd break the rule * On Christmas there's no school * * Why can't all children stay up late instead * * What are children like when they're wide awake * * Are they just as nice as can be * * Are they always as polite * With their faces scrubbed bright * * The way all children are when they're asleep * * What are children like * When they're wide awake * It's always been a puzzle to me * * Do they always wear a smile * Mind their manners all the while * * The way all children do when they're asleep * * Some people say children are good * * Only when they're fast asleep * * I must confess it's only a guess * * They're just as good when they're wide awake * * As when they're fast asleep * What are children like when they're wide awake * * I think they're just the same as you and me * * Some days they get in trouble * * And on other days they bubble * * And that's the way I think it ought to be * * And that's the way I think it ought to be * Sam, Sam? I can't face them. - Santa, Santa wait, wait! Where do you think you're going? - Out. - But Santa wait a minute. What will Mr. Prim say? What will everybody say? That Santa Claus is scared of children? No, no, no. This is no time to quit. If you lose your job you'll never be able to pay the rent. Oh, come on Santa. Wide awake or fast asleep they're still children. - But what do I do? What do I say? - Just act natural. Ask the children if they've behaved themselves. Ask what they would like for Christmas. Then every once in awhile throw in a couple of ho, ho, ho's just to show how jolly you are. - Oh, well that sounds easy enough. - Come on, I'll show you. Ready? How old are you my boy? - How old are you my boy? - No, no, no. How old are you my boy? - How old are you my boy? - That's better. Now, ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, ho. - No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. For children, your ho, ho, ho's have got to be lots bigger. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, ho, ho. (Sam laughing) (Santa laughing) - Now, and have you been a good girl? - And have you been a good girl? (Sam laughs) (Santa laughs) - And what would you like for Christmas? - And what would you like for Christmas? (Santa laughing) Oh, hey Sam this is fun. (Santa laughing) (Sam laughing) (Sam gasps) - Oh dear, I hope I haven't broken it. This would be a fine time to lose my job. - Here, you better let me handle this. There's nothing about toys that I don't know. That's it. (toy chiming) Say, Mr. Prim has quite a respectable collection of toys here. You don't suppose he'd mind if I tried a few of 'em? (gentle music) (hooves clomping) (gentle music) (Santa laughing) (Sam laughing) - Whoops! (Santa laughing) (Sam laughing) (gentle music) (toys whirring) (bell clinking) (men laughing) (upbeat music) - [Shopkeeper] Just a moment please. - Oh! (gentle music) - Grownups playing with toys. - Well, that's not the sort of service I expected at Prim's Department Store. (upbeat music) - Come on Santa, let's go to work. (gentle music) - Please. (children chattering) (upbeat music) - Mama, it's really Santa Claus. - And how are you my girl? - And how are you my girl? - I'm fine Santa. Don't you know my name? - Of course. Let me see now. Your name is Suzy. - Mama, he knows my name. - Darling, darling, don't pull the gentleman's beard. It might come off. - Oh no, Mama. It's real. - May I? - Please. (woman gasps) - Imagine Mr. Prim going to all that trouble to find an old man with a real beard. I declare, really what will they think of next? Santa Claus in a department store. Well, of course you realize this could only happen in a large city. Now, we come from a small town, and I keep telling my husband... (playful music) But just you wait til I tell him about this. A real honest to goodness Santa Claus and in a department store. (shoppers chattering) - This is what I want. - My dear Sir, you certainly do understand children. (gentle music) - Blossom! Blossom! Blossom! Blossom! (ominous music) Blossom? - [Blossom] Yes, Sir? - Blossom, do you know what he's done? - Who Sir? - Santa Claus you fool! Do you know what he's done? - Not until you tell me Sir. (Mr. Prune groans) - He's found a job. - Doing what Sir? - Making children happy. - [Blossom] Oh, horrible Sir. - Blossom, I must think. I must think. I must think. I must think. - Don't you think you ought to leave that sort of thing to me Sir? - Blossom, I am perfectly capable of thinking for myself. Where is my book? Hm. (ominous playful music) Hm. (ominous playful music) Hm. (ominous playful music) Hm. (ominous playful music) Hm. (ominous playful music) Blossom he must be stopped! - Calmly does it Sir. - If he makes enough money to pay the rent I'm ruined. I am ruined! (Mr. Prune sobbing) - [Blossom] Here Sir, a sip of this will soothe your nerves. (Mr. Prune's hand thudding) - No. - [Blossom] Please Sir. - No. - [Blossom] Please Sir. - No. Please Sir. - No. - [Blossom] Sir! - No. But it... (Mr. Prune grimaces) How can you be so calm? - Because I have a plan Sir. (upbeat music) (Blossom whispering) (upbeat music) - Good! Good. Good. (Blossom whispering) Good! (gentle music) (ominous playful music) - Blah! (Mr. Prune grimaces) (playful music) Blah! (ominous playful music) - Blossom! - Yes Sir? - The chair. - [Boy] Blah! - Ah, oo! Blossom! (playful music) (Blossom whispering) Mm hm. (playful music) (gentle music) (air hissing) (ominous playful music) (Mr. Prune spitting) - Oh! (ominous playful music) - Ready? - Yes Sir. (balloon bursting) (Mr. Prune gasps) (gentle music) (ominous playful music) (air puffing) (Mr. Prune gasping) (playful music) (gentle music) (ominous playful music) - Oh! (playful music) (fire crackling) Think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something! - Oh. (Mr. Prune sighs) - I'll think of something. Think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something, think of something. - What Sir? - Mm. (Mr. Prune sighs) (fire crackling) - I've though of something. Thought of something, thought of something, thought of something. (Blossom whispering) - Yes. That is something. That's something. That's something. That's something. That's something. That's something.

Just one more day to go and you and Mrs. Santa will have enough money to pay the rent. And Merry Christmas to you too Mr. Prune wherever you are. - You know Sam, speaking of Mr. Prune, I wonder if Jonathan found his name anywhere. It must be somewhere in one of those books. (Jonathan snoring) - Jonathan? - Hm? - Jonathan? - Hm? Pickles, popcorn! - Tea. - Oh. Have you found it yet? - I'm sorry Mrs. Santa. We looked through every single book but still no sign of a Prune. - Then you'll have to start all over again. It must be somewhere. Do you realize it is now December 24th? It's Christmas Eve. You must find it. Nothing must stop Christmas from coming. - [Santa's Helpers] But we're sleeping. - No sleep until you find that name. Now come on everybody. Prune, Prune, Prune. - Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune, Prune. - Goodnight Joe. - [Joe] Night. - Night Joe. Merry Christmas. - [Joe] Merry Christmas, Sam. - Well Santa we've done it, we've done it, we've done it and as soon as Mr. Prim pays us we'll be off. - Well Sam, while we're waiting, let's tidy up the place a bit. - Good idea. (boxes clattering) Now how'd I do that? - Spooks. (boxes clattering) - More spooks I guess. (boxes clattering) - [Santa] Sam, what's going on? (objects clattering) - My, my, my, aren't we the industrious ones? - Mr. Prune, what are you doing in Prim's Department Store? - Correction! You mean Prune's Department Store don't you? Prune! P-R-U-N-E. (Mr. Prune tsking) Oh (chuckles). All those dear little toys broken. Mr. Claus, one will think I've never handled toys before. Now, let me see. Your name is Billy (chuckles), and have you been a good little boy (chuckles)? And how are you my little girl (laughs)? - And what would you like for-- - Oh! And what would you like for Christmas (laughs)? - Just a moment. Did you say your department store? - As of six o'clock this evening it became mine. All mine, signed, sealed and delivered. And now it is my great pleasure to announce you are fired! - Wait a minute. What about our pay? You're not going to try to get out of that are you? - My dear young man, how can you even suggest such a thing? Of course not. No. What's right is right. Blossom. - Oh, thank you Mr. Prune. I'm afraid we've misjudged you. - All right now Santa. Pay him the rent. - Please, please. Just one moment. What about these toys? I'm not blaming you. Of course I realize it was an accident, but look at my side of it. I've been fair with you, I paid you. Now in turn you must respect my rights. According to my new regulation, 4211 and I quote, "An employee shall always pay "for broken merchandise out of his own pocket." Unquote. Now let me see. Dolls, two, windmill uh, four. Horses, 700. And that leaves you exactly one. And now gentlemen, try and pay the rent with that. - Oh dear. I'm sorry. - Not at all my dear, dear friend. This will just about pay for repairing the damage. Gentlemen, this way out! - All right Mr. Phineas T. Prune, but we're not licked yet. There's still some time before midnight. Come on Santa, come on. - At last, at last. At last! All these years I waited and now victory's mine! Do you hear that? Victory's mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! And Merry Christmas I don't think! (Mr. Prune laughing) (ominous music) (upbeat music) * I've got a date with Santa * At half past Christmas time * I've got a date with Santa * We'll have a lovely time * I've had my nap, I'm feelin' great * * My mom says I can stay up late * * I'm dressed up in my very best * * To meet my Merry Christmas guest * (footsteps thudding) * I've got a date with Santa * He's got a date with me * I've got a gift for Santa * And he'll have some for me * He said he'd stay and chat awhile * * He's got the nicest friendly smile * * I've got a date with Santa * At half past Christmas time * I must try to stay awake * He comes just once a year * There's a speech I want to make * * I love you Santa dear (footsteps thudding) * I've got a date with Santa * How lucky can you get * I've got a date with Santa * I hope he won't forget * We're meeting at my Christmas tree * * 'Cause that's where he said he would be * * I've got a date with Santa * At half past Christmas time (footsteps thudding) (wind whistling) - What time is it Sam? - 10 o'clock. - Two more hours to go. (footsteps thudding) (wind whistling) - I'm sorry Santa. I've been racking my brains but I still can't come up with any bright ideas. - Now, my boy you mustn't blame yourself. You did your best. Nevermind. Something will turn up. - What? I can't think of anything. - A miracle perhaps? I don't know of a better time for a miracle then on Christmas Eve. (Charlie whistling) - Merry Christmas Sirs. - And a Merry Christmas to you. You're out kind of late aren't you? - I know, but I've got permission. You see, trees are always less expensive if you pick 'em up at the last minute. You know something Mister? You look kinda familiar. I've seen you someplace before. Would you mind stepping closer to the lamppost? Well of course. No wonder. Why, it's Santa Claus. - Hello Charlie. - You know my name too. But wait a minute. What are you doing here Santa? You're not due for a couple of hours yet. - Well, I, that is... - Hey Santa, are you all right? This is no time to be down in the dumps. Christmas is coming (chuckles). Imagine me telling Santa Claus about Christmas. - You're very kind my boy. - Are you in trouble or something? - No, no, no, no, no. No, no. I'm all right, I'm all right. - No, something's wrong. I can feel it in my bones. Come on Santa, tell me. What's the trouble? Well, do you know? - [Sam] Mm hm. - Well? Come on. Tell me. - No Sam, please. - I'm sorry Santa but this is no time for pride. (Sam whispering) (wind whistling) - Golly Santa. You really are in trouble. Boy. This is an emergency. We've got to do something. And quick. Hey, I've got a quarter you can have. Will that be enough? No, I guess not. Well, we better think fast. Hey! I've got it. Why don't we ask all the kids to chip in? I'll bet they'd be glad to help. - Oh, I couldn't allow that. - Why not? You've been doing thing for us for a long time. It's time we started doing something for you. What are friends for anyway? Hey kids, wake up! Hey kids, wake up! Hey kids, do you hear me? Wake up, wake up! Do you hear me? Listen kids, Santa Claus is in a jam. Got no time to explain but he needs money to pay the rent, so start diggin' in! Do ya hear me? Wake up, wake up!

(coins clattering) - Ah, foiled, foiled, foiled again! - Santa you're late. I think you'd better hurry up and get that sleigh loaded. - Oh my goodness yes. You and Mrs. Santa will have to come along and give me a hand. Come on men, let's get moving. - Now, now Mr. Prune. You'll feel better after you've had a cup of tea.

(gentle music) From Jonathan. - My head bookkeeper. - "Dear Mr. Prune, "Santa asked me to see if there was any record of you.

"Please forgive me. "But I shall never forgive myself. "Sincerely, Jonathan." - Now I understand why. - Everybody said that there is something funny about little Phineas. Why doesn't Santa ever visit him? Maybe he isn't a child after all. I made up my mind I didn't want to be a child. I wanted to forget I ever was a child. - [Santa] Poor Phineas. - Oh no, there is no need to feel sorry for me. I got the one thing I ever really wanted with all my heart. I do believe I feel better than I have felt in years and years and years. - That's right my boy. There's nothing like Christmas to make a fellow feel better. May I say just one more thing? Merry Christmas. - Dear, dear Phineas. But Santa, we can't just leave Phineas like this in such a gloomy house at Christmas time. Well then, don't just stand there. Do something.
