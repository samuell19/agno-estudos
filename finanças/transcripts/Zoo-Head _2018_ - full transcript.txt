(dramatic music) I can't see. I can't frickin' see. Calm down Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. What? How many have you taken? How many? What is that smell. How many Charlie? That smell Megan, what the hell is that smell? Jesus, you can't even keep track of what you steal. Close the door. What are you gonna do with these? Close the door! [Megan] We need to talk. We are talking. Properly. We are talking properly. If we were, you wouldn't be zooting. Oh, here we go again. What are you my mother? Well, I might as well be. Who else is gonna lecture you? Barton? Barton's cool man. Look, you know what this is doing to you right? Right? Delusions, blackouts, deja vus. You want to throw your memory into a grinder, you be my guest Charlie, but don't drag me in it. Then bloody leave. Megan. Megan! Wait, don't go. I'm late for work. What work, there ain't work. It is. It's a work trial. It's slave labor, Megan. They make you work for free and you hope you get a job at the end, right? It's none of your business. I just don't want you to get your hopes up. I want you to get out. What? Look, yeah, I'm a shit. But I care about you. You know, I'll fix things. I'm make them right. Get Barton to clean this place up if you won't. (gentle music) (keyboard clicking) That is not enough. At least it's there, right? So you just want to come in here and sign on and go home. That's not a proper work search Charlie. What more do you want? I want a proper work search for once. We go through this every time. How about fast forwarding it to the last part. Listen, you've been signing on for a while now. And absolutely zero work progress has been made. What is it, is this zootropic. I'm not on zoots, man. Besides it's none of your business what I do. Oh, it is. We're paying you decent money to do a work search, not go and jack up. Yeah, I'm working on that. Are you? I've heard you've been selling meat to dodgy restaurants. What other things you got going on aside. Selling goat shit to Starbucks. It's a pity you're not like Megan. Yeah, she's gonna have a proper job soon. Zoo-Heads don't get jobs. Listen, she's clean. Which is the sad part, isn't it, because you're probably gonna send her over the edge again. Have you heard of Infinity? Those brain butchers. Memories. They're a memory clinic. Listen, they've got a rehabilitation program, they're trialing it through us. What us, unemployed scum guinea pigs. Yeah, no thanks. It's not a choice. You can't force me to go to that place. I don't want anyone inside my head, not them, not you. You've got nothing to worry about. I mean it's only memory loop. Yeah, I'm not bloody doing it. Well, the appointment's already been made. And what if I don't go. Well, I'll just stop all of your benefits completely and then I'd personally go to the police and tell them about this zootropics. You can't do that. I can do anything I want. Not in my brain, man, no one. (door slamming) (upbeat technological music) I need to talk. Meat's gone bad. Suffocation of currant. Unification or conformity. There. This about your father again? You're still seeing him? Welfare wants me to go to Infinity. What? Holy shit. Are you getting a memory loop. Yeah. Why, are they handing out freebies at welfare now. Part of their drug rehabilitation bullshit. It's a con to get into my head, man. No, brother, this is the real deal. It'll be good for you. You'll finally get clean. I'm not doing it. You are doing it. I'm not. You're desperate for a way out, but you're afraid. Afraid to circumcise your heart and be free. Stay afraid and you'll cease to exist. You'll belong with those selfie taking maggots and their empty photos. You're doing it. Now, go, get rid of that meat. Then let's get to work. We've got a lot of doors to know on for some sales. You don't get to boss me around Barton. Who else will father you then? (gentle music) (phone ringing) [Megan] Hi, this is Megan. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hey, it's me, pick up will you. I'm trying to reach you. Sorry for messing up. Please call me. (gentle music) (dramatic music) [Father] Hey, Charlie. A limp dick in your and soaking in stale cum. Masturbation's become your only prayer for salvation kid. (technological jingles) (dramatic drums beating) You're very lucky to have been chosen Charlie. What happened? Who are you? I'm Dr. Pierce. You passed out. You're malnourished. When was the last time you ate? What's my stomach got to do with my head. If you undergo looping, your vitals need to be spot on. What is this? We're memory mapping you. What? In order for memory looping to work, we need to do a clean sweep of your mind, check for any anomalies or memory corruption. And so far you've got quite a bit. A bit of what? Memory corruption. You have any reoccurring dreams? Dreams, I thought this was about memories? Dreams are indicative of memories. I only have one dream. Breaker's Beach, I was six, building a sandcastle, that's about it. That may be a little young for us to loop you into. Anything significant happen there? No. How long have you been using. Don't knowú, three, four years. PCP? Mm-hmm. Heroin? Yeah. Methamphetamine? Mm-hmm. Anything else. Nope. Zootropics? You certain it's only heroin at the moment? Yeah, why? It's best if you're honest Charlie before we start the looping. Are you gonna tell me what this looping is? We loop you into a memory of yours when you were sober. You inhabit your past self. That allows your mind to progress to its original state, healing damaged neurons and realigning neurotransmitters. Then what? Then we bring you back. After that comes the hard part. Hard part? Once we bring you out of the loop and back to your present day body, your mind may be fixed, but your body will still be drug ridden. We have an after care program for that. So what you're saying is I come back, and I'm still messed up. It's two stages. Looping takes care of your mind. We take care of your body afterwards. You mess with my brain doing some back to the future crap to it won't work. It works, even though it's a trial. You won't even be aware that you're in a memory repeating itself. What's that? Urine sample. We need to do a blood test, too. We need a full breakdown of what's in your system. What? (dramatic music) [Father] They're gonna know son. They're gonna know and they'll eat you up. Shut up, shut it. So what are the results? We won't have them until later. We'll give you a call to let you know if you're suitable. If I'm not? The welfare office gets a full report. Get dressed, you're free to go. (laughing) Hey space boy, how was Infinity. You went to Infinity? Yes, Megan, I went to Infinity. You wouldn't bloody know since you didn't pick up your phone. Whoa, whoa, chill brother. What happened? They did a drug test on me, man. Yeah, that's pretty standard. What you knew, you fucking knew. What the hell were you doing at Infinity? Of course I knew, I interned there, well until somebody fucked me over. You should have told me. For you to do what, huh? If you didn't go welfare would screw you over. Okay, now that I've screwed anyway by it. Did you get one of those memory loop trials from welfare? Your lucky fucker. Relax. Zootropics are untraceable. What do you mean untraceable? They can't detect anything. I bet you asked you to be honest and shit, right? It's because they can't trace shit. So you're doing it right? No. You are doing it? What's it to you? What's it to me? The fact that I've had to put up with your shit since I met you, that's what's up with me. Here we go again, another bitch fit. You little shit. Do you even know how lucky you are? Do you know how much the memory programs cost. An ungrateful little shit gets free treatment and you won't go. Get the fuck off me. Oh, you're gonna punch me Megan, come on, hit me. That is it. I swear to God, I'm done with you. Just leave. Who's stopping you. What the hell is wrong with you. She can't mind her own business. You are her business. [Charlie] What? Self-destruction is imminent. Self-preservation is decadent. Hey, hey, hey. Fucking I've had it with him. He's a mess and you, you encourage him. I do not encourage him. Where's he getting his stash of zoots from? From me. I actually find that quite offensive. You're the one who got all worked up when you heard about his trip to Infinity, so what's up. I couldn't get on the trial. Why not? Because I was zooting and welfare thought it was too risky. Barton, don't you get memory shortage? There's a large part of memory that's really messed up in there, but sort of the price we pay for zooting, right? Doesn't that bother you? Just learn to make up my own past. Barton, that's denial. No, denial is paying taxes and then believing that you're a good person. I can't remember any of my childhood. Can't remember any of it? Look, the life you own doesn't have to own you. You can do anything you want with it. You can even trade it on eBay. Barton, it's a part of me. No matter how hard I try, I can't remember any of it. What I was like as a kid, what I did, my hobbies, friends, my parents. They're just blank faces. You're starting over. You're getting clean, you got that new work trial at the restaurant. They fired me. Fuck. It's gone shit Barton. I was saving my welfare for memory reconstruction. Seriously? Yeah, I'm piss broke. I can't even afford to eat and I'm trying to save to get my memory back. I'm a joke. You want it really bad, huh? How much is it? Don't ask. [Barton] Have you look into payment plans? Look at me Barton, I can't face going in there. They'll think I'm a cheap skank. Charlie's the cheap skank. He's getting free treatment and he's still bitching about it. I really thought I could help him. Most people just don't want to change. You caring for Charlie's not gonna fill the gap you have for your parents. Parents you can't even remember having. So if you want the real deal, then go for it. You think so? I want to help you. Really? Selling dildos to lonely housewives actually does bring in a lot of money. Thanks, Barton. I'll think about it. Just don't tell Charlie. I wouldn't tell him. (water flowing) (dramatic music) No. [Father] Charlie. Charlie. (dramatic music) Charlie. Charlie. Go away. [Father] Time for a fix Charlie. Charlie. (heavy breathing) You're messing it all up again son. Barton, Barton, Barty, come out man. Open the door, open the door please. Open the fucking door you fuck. [Father] Get your fucking arse over here you fucking little shit. [Barton] Do your own cooking. [Megan] How real will it be once I have it? It will be your complete memory. All of it will be real and intact. How can it? You're filling in gaps of my memory with odd bits. Think of it like skin grafting. We simply take a healthy substitute and mold it to suit the missing memory. What, how can you mold my adult memories into my childhood ones? How can it fit? That's why we sometimes use dreams. Dreams? We use fragments of dreams to substitute childhood missing memories. I don't dream about my childhood Dr. Pierce. I never had. After the addiction you may never have, but before you certainly would have. The mind is a complex place Megan. It has dark alleys and many locked doors. That's where we come in. We simply find the doors and unlock them. I like to think the mind is never truly damaged. It's a hard fix, but never truly damaged. Hard fix. That's why it's so expensive, right? Memory reconstruction is a very delicate procedure and yes, it's one of our most costly packages. I really need this Dr. Pierce. I brought it on myself. I've even started praying. But I don't think God is stupid. He gave me something and I took to away. We all make mistakes Megan. It took a lot of courage for you to come out as a zootropic addict. If God didn't want you to have your memory back, a place like Infinity wouldn't exist. We're here to help. Do you have a payment plan. Before we discuss that, we need to talk about the risks. Okay, well, what are they? If the synopsis for your childhood memory reject substitutes, a backlash may occur, creating a complete wipe out of your long-term memory. What? You have to think of it like a computer, crashing, losing all the bits memory. I'm not a bloody PC, though. It's a very small percentage of that happening. But it is something you need to think about. There is one dream that I have and I'm wearing this wedding dress and I'm holding this child and it won't stop crying. It doesn't make sense. Dreams are amalgamations of various psychological processes and it could be your mother holding you or something as simple as you playing with a doll as a child. No. It wasn't a doll. And I couldn't get it to stop crying. Sunny skies with isolated acid showers in the north. Zootropics go from pill format to baby formula. City official rapes dog, tweets selfie. (groaning) Looks like mama's gonna have to clean up again. Oh, my God. Aw, squishy. (phone buzzing) Hello, Charlie speaking. [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, this is Dr. Pierce from Infinity. We've got your lab results back. Splendid, jolly good. [Dr. Pierce] Yes, well, they're all clear so you're good to go. Can you come in today? Today? [Dr. Pierce] Yes, today, in an hour? Wow, yeah. I'll be there. Looking forward to it, God bless. I feel like shit. Well, you shit yourself if that helps. What's going on? Soap. I need lots of soap. (funky technological music) In anticipation of your suicide, please make sure tray tables are in their full upright position. What are you doing? Getting you ready for school. Charlie. Charlie. Because of your severe memory corruption, we've had very little to work with, so you'll probably experience fluctuations which take the form of inconsistencies, hallucinations. What? Relax. We're in complete control. We can pull the plug at any time. Screw this. What the fuck is this. They're cautionary restraints so you don't hurt yourself in the loop. Get me the fuck out of this. [Dr. Pierce] Relax. Get me out. Pierce, you fuck, get me the fuck out of this chair. What the hell is that? Something to calm you down. You're fucking sick. Don't, don't. Please, please. I can't go back, I can't go back, please. He's there. He's there. Charlie relax. It's only a memory, it's not real, no one can hurt you. You don't fucking understand. Pierce you fuck. (dramatic music) (computer keys beeping) (dramatic music) What the? (computer beeping) [Father] Charlie. (Charlie screaming) Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. (Charlie screaming) (heart monitor beeping) I can't see. Frickin' sun in my eye. Calm down. Charlie. I was on the beach just now. What Breaker's Beach? You're just tripping. How many did you take? What's that smell? How many. Jesus, you can't even keep track of what you steal. Put that down. How many? Charlie, how many. How many what? Zoots for crying out loud, how many pills did you shoot up? You need to talk right? What? That's why you're here. Well, I've been meaning for talk to you for a while. You can't break up with me. What? Not right now, something's not right. What the bloody hell do you mean I can't break up with you right now. [Charlie] Please, I need you to listen. Oh, what now you want to talk. Ah, shut up Megan, just. Megan. Megan! I was at the beach Megan, the bloody beach. I have seriously had it with you. Wait, wait. No, I'm late for work. Listen. No. Please. You dream about that beach all the time for a reason. Sort it out Charlie. And what if I don't go? Well, then I'll cut off all your benefits. [Father] It's all rewind Charlie. Zootropics. You can't do that. I can do whatever I want. (technological music) I need to talk. The meat's gone bad. Suffocation of current. Unification or conformity. I'm having some messed up deja vus, man. Is this about your father again? You still seeing him? Listen. That's the zoots talking. The fridge, the welfare advisor, what he said about Infinity. Holy shit. Are you getting a memory loop. I knew that, I knew you was gonna say all of that. [Father] Charlie. Where the hell did that come from? What's that Chuck? The bear, the frickin' bear. You've always had that thing, man. You're doing this loop. Is this some kind of sick joke. Where did you get this from? You've always had it with you. You're messing with me Barton. This bear can't be here, it's a fake. A fake? So it's a fake bear. Don't play with me Barton, I'm warning you. You've always had that thing, man. It's your only memory from your childhood. No, he took it. You're getting worse Chuck. You need to do this, this needs to stop. Megan's scared. I don't think Megan wants to be with you anymore man. You seriously need to get clean. You think I'm fuckin' stupid Bart, huh? Get a fucking fake bear and fuck with me. Christ, listen to yourself. It's a fuckin' teddy bear. I don't need you to get in here. Well, guess what, there's not much in there to get into. (grunting) Chill the fuck out. Fuck! [Barton] I've had it. I've been patient. I've been saintly and all you ever are is a spoiled fucking brat. I didn't want to do this bro, but you leave me no choice. What is that? What is that? Inhibitor when you're zoot crazy. Resist the passive aggression of conformity and indulge in violence and oppression. Let go of me! Let go of me! All sons ride down dark alleys Chuck. You're lost. Looking for a god. To fear, to worship, to become like those we worship. (Charlie screaming) You worship an absent father you become lost. Just like him. (dramatic music) (baby crying) [Charlie] Megan. He wouldn't stop crying. He lost his toy. I have tried everything. Maybe you can try. [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, it's Dr. Pierce, can you hear me? (drums thumping) (sighing) What are the results? Charlie, do you use zootropics? No. So why is there a zootropic inhibitor in your system? My friend was messing around. You do realize the implications of using zootropics, right? Don't tell them, please. I have no choice. Please don't, they'll cut off my benefits. You should be more interested in what the police have to say. You think I enjoy signing on, huh? Why don't you fucking try it, living like a piece of shit that everyone laughs at. (sighing) What the hell? Hey, space boy, how was Infinity? Infinity? How was it? [Megan] Charlie? I'm gonna fucking kill you. Stop. I'm fucked because of you, Barton, I'm totally fucked. Enough. What? What happened? Jesus Charlie, you look like shit. You went to Infinity? Did welfare send you? What happened? The drug test on me. They know I'm zooting. Fucking Barton spiked me with an inhibitor. They traced it. Shit. I'm done for Megan. They're call welfare, the police, I'm done for. Listen. Everything's gonna be okay, all right. Megan, I think I'm in a loop. What? My deja vus, they're bad, but they're not the zoots type. You're just tripping Charlie. No, no, this is different. Listen to me. No, you listen. Why can't you ever trust me. Hey, I do trust you, okay? I did. What? You've changed Charlie. You've got to stop running away from your past. You keep trying to make things right with me, but it's not about us. It's about you. And there's only one person you've got to let go of. No. Your dad is dead Charlie. For Christ's sake Megan. Why do you bring this up all the time. Why can't you just drop it. Because I love you. You fuckin' asshole. You love me? I lost my work trial today. You were right. They just used me. Go on, laugh. It's not funny. You always thought it was. I was hoping you'd prove me wrong because I need you to be right. I always need you to be right. Get some sleep Charlie. You really need it. Can't. Just try. I'll sort things out. (knocking) Dr. Pierce. [Dr. Pierce] Yes. You saw a friend of mine yesterday, Charlie. Ah, yes. I'm not here to defend him or anything. He can be an idiot most of the time. He was difficult. Did you call welfare or the police? I thought you weren't here to defend him. Look, I'm an ex-zoo-head myself. I met him back when I was on it. Under all that bullshit doctor, he's a good guy. Seriously. I know you have to do what you have to do, but this, it will ruin his life. I appreciate the concern you have for your friend. Thanks for stopping by. That's it. I've got work to do. Have you ever signed on? Excuse me? Have you ever signed on to unemployment benefits? Are you gonna have a go at me too, now? No, I'm just asking a simple question. No, I haven't. So you won't be aware the welfare holds you by the neck every single day, that you're seen as a scrounger by everyone. You can't even look at yourself in the mirror because you're afraid to see what they see. Is that what you see? I didn't call the welfare office of the police. I realized that it would have caused him a lot more trouble. What's your name? Megan. I had a son Charlie's age. He died from zootropics. I still think he he got his hands on them and if I could change things, my advice to you is get your friend sober as quickly as possible. Is that why you work at Infinity? Hoping to change the past? The past can't be changedú. The perception of it can, though. But you don't need Infinity for that. I've heard that Infinity can create memories, right? So why not create happy ones? Because God doesn't create perfect lives Megan. It's suffering that develops perseverance, then character, and finally hope. Hope to persevere through suffering full circle. Full circle. I have some bad news about Charlie, though. What? Although I didn't tell the welfare office, I can't do the looping if he's a severe zootropic addict, it's just too risky. If he doesn't do the loop, welfare will ask and they'll find out anyway. I'm afraid so. How much? What? How much would it cost to do it anyway? That's out of the question, please leave. How much? Leave. How much? You may not be able to change your son's past, but you can change Charlie's. Hello? Guys? What the hell happened Barton? Must have been hungry. Come on. Come on. [Barton] Yeah, wouldn't do that if I were you. For fuck's sake Barton, how long has he been like this? Beats me. I tried moving him but he just keeps puking. What the hell happened? He could have food poisoning. Why didn't you do anything? úOh. Come on, he has to get dressed. Why, does he have a date? He needs to go to Infinity. What? Are you gonna help me or not. Barton. You gotta cut him off Megs, look at him. He's dead weight. You need to do it, you know you do. The sooner the better. A blackhead on your dick grows into a full grown zit if you don't squeeze it out in time and that is pain. Crucifixion pain. Yeah, well I don't have a dick you moron. (vomiting) Please Megan, Please Megan, don't make me go. It's okay Charlie, I spoke to them. No, this isn't right, please. Just hold still. (dramatic music) Get me the fuck out of this. [Megan] This is the only way Charlie. Get me out! If you don't do this, welfare will ask questions. If they do it, I'll die. Calm down Charlie. Don't fucking tell me to calm down. I've been trying to tell you something, something's not right, I've been trying to tell you. That's because you're zooted up Charlie. No. What the hell is that? Something to calm down. Listen, if you fucking touch me, I swear to God I'll fucking kill you. No, no, please, please, please, no, no. I can't go back, I can't go back, I can't go back. Charlie. Please out of everyone you have to believe me, He's there Megan, he's there, he's gonna get me. Your dad's dead Charlie. Calm down Charlie, it's only a memory. It's not real, no one can hurt you. He's there on the beach, please. I fucking trusted you, please. I fucking trusted you, I trusted you. What the hell? [Father] Need a fix sweetie? Well done, sweetie, he's gonna die again. (screaming) Charlie! Charlie, wake up. Charlie, can you hear me. Charlie wake up! Charlie. [Father] Very, very real. [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, we're going to pull you out. Charlie. How many did you take? You were there. You were in my head. Why are you shaking? You look like you've been zooting. Shut up. Meg listen to me, I'm in the loop. In the loop and I know you know, I know you know. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! (dramatic music) Why am I in a loop? You sent me to Infinity, this has already happened. They put me in a loop, I can't get out. What? How do I get out. Wow, you're even more crazy than I thought. Listen to me you prick. This is a loop. I don't what game you and Infinity are playing, but if you don't get me help, I swear to God. You little shit. How did you get in my head? Answer me, what are you and Infinity doing? It's all over for you now Charlie mate. We've been waiting a long, long time for you to crack. (evil laughing) (door slamming) The meat's gone bad. Wait, wait, wait. Fuck. Wait, wait, I'm in a loop, I'm in a loop. What? In a loop. Oh, shit. Go get a wet cloth, go. He's there, he's there. Barton, Barton. You been feeding her? What the fuck? Look at her, she's zooting. Your dad. [Charlie] What? Your dad, he's there. He's here. You saw my dad. Megan, you been zooting? Shut up Barton. Fine, you explain to me why she's all zooted out then. I'm in his head. Your memories, I seen them. Breaker's Beach, the sand castle, the bear. I see it. (dramatic music) That shouldn't be there, that shouldn't be there. What the fuck is going on? It's Infinity. They did something to me, now they're doing something to her. Infinity. You've both been to Infinity? Not this time around. Not yet. Right Megan? We need to get into Infinity, you need to see what's going on in my head. Barton, I need your help. She needs your help. You can get us in, you intern there. (dramatic music) Good thing I'm always here to bail you out. Come on. (computer keys clicking) Get your ass in there. What are you doing? Scanning. Bart. Barton. Something must be wrong. Oh, fuck. How the fuck are you in a loop? That's what I've been trying to tell you. You have to do something to get him out of this Barton. Why me? What, you want me to beg? 'Cause you're the one who knows Infinity's stuff. I was just a used and abused intern. Screw that, you know this shit inside out. Well, wouldn't hurt if you begged. Barton. All right, all right. Chill. Good news is that you won't actually die. Your real body's at some future point outside of this memory. I'm guessing lying there knocked out, hooked up like this, you die in a loop, it just restarts. What's the bad news. There's no way out of it. What? All control is at the future point outside of this loop, so only they can pull the plug. Pierce. That's why I've been hearing Pierce's voice. Huh? I think Pierce, the doctor who did this, had been trying to reach out to me. A future Pierce. Yeah, that or you're hearing things. You're still a Zoo-Head, remember. But why am I reliving his memories? Am in in a loop? Doubt it. Could be something else entirely. A shared dream, telepathy, heightened kundalini, evolutionary step in Christ's consciousness. Or zoots. I'm not zooting you asshole. We need to figure out a way to get me out of this. I'm the reason she's like this. There is one way. What? Loophole theory. Every time a loop ends, there's a small intermission, a breaker, before the next round loop starts. We call this a loophole. And? Okay, try to stay with me. If genius here can catch his loophole, he can use it to jump out, but that's like getting a hole in one. Like an after death experience, like fucking seeing heaven and shit, which is actually just a rush of oxygen to your brain causing you to get high and see Hindu cows. Okay, what happens if I don't catch it? I'm not really sure, thus a theory. The next round of loop could be altered. A lot based on how fucked up your memory is. Or your real future self could die. Die? Yeah, tragic right. This means I have to wait for this run of the loop to end and it always ends with me dying. So? We wait. No. No? [Charlie] We'll do it. The loop, are you kidding me? Well, I'm gonna need some of this. Help. [Father] Charlie. [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, Charlie, can you hear me? Charlie. There's something I need to tell you. What is it? I was saving my welfare benefits to get a memory reconstruction done at Infinity. What? Zoot's messed me up, Charlie.ú They messed me up real bad. No memories. Charlie. What if I've already been to Infinity. What if they really messed up and gave me your memories? I don't know. It's possible. Or, you could have had memory reconstruction in one of Chuck's previous loops and you're just feeling the effects now, like ripples in water, or parallel realities. Each one of Chuck's loops is a parallel reality. That's pretty fucked up if you think about it. But hey, not just what I think. This could all be a Greek tragedy. Curtain up in two. Charlie, are you sure you want to do this? I'm sorry Megan. For everything I messed up. Charlie, you went to Infinity. You wanted to get better. No, I didn't. I just wanted to bury it all, forget it all. Your memories, they're everything. What if they weren't mine Megan? I mean who knows what Infinity can do? Relax, it's okay. You know, maybe we are. I couldn't get you out my mind anyway. I like having you in mine. (Barton clearing throat) [Barton] Stewardess, what's the inflight movie this evening? [Megan] Shut up. [Barton] Chuck, this may sting a little. Hold on to your nuts. Any last words? (water flowing) Charlie. Charlie, we're trying to get you out of here. (baby crying) [Father] Your mother didn't want you. She's not my mother. (Charlie screaming) He's rejecting the loop. Come on, do something. Shut up. [Megan] Charlie, don't be afraid, Charlie. (Charlie screaming) Barton. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Megan. Megan, wake up. Megan. Megan. (vomiting) I have no idea what's happening, but I'll fix it. For once in my life I'll fix it. Give them to me Charlie. (Megan screaming) Give them to me. Pierce. Can I help you? Barton? What the hell are you doing here? I work here. Who are you? Who am I, what the fuck is this? Do you have an appointment. Barton, stop. Please don't make a scene and just leave. Have you seen Megan, have you seen what she's been up to? She's zooting Barton, she's zooting. If you don't pack up your stuff and leave, I am gonna call the police. What? You have no idea who I am, do you? Shit. Oh, God. Parallel reality, all this has to be. Okay, I'm calling the police. No, no, we live together. You pay my rent. You tell me about the father all the time, about my memory at Breaker's Beach. Breaker's Beach. Yeah. Which memory? Of my father. He used to beat the shit out of me. The sandcastle, the teddy bear. How the hell do you know that. It's my own memory. No, it is not. Of course it is. No, it's not, that's my memory. I've never told anybody about what my father did to me. What? Here, she's over here. Barton. Barton. Barton. Jesus. Megan, Megan. Oh, she's cut herself really bad. Move, move, move. She needs to get to the hospital now. You shouldn't have taken my zoots Charlie. It's gonna be okay. [Megan] It doesn't matter Charlie. Don't say that. It doesn't. I was my dad's punching bag. Had it coming. What? Breaker's Beach. That's my memory Megan. Who's been zooting now. This can't be happening. Where'd you get this? The dress, tell me, tell me. Your mom gave it to me. I never knew my mother. Yes, you did. Megan. Megan. Charlies, she's. Megan. Megan. [Father] You fucking little shit. Look at me, look at me. I'll fucking kill you. (Charlie screaming) I'll fucking kill you. I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of you. [Father] Be careful what you see, son. [Dr. Pierce] Charlie, it's okay. You can come out now. Am I dead. [Dr. Pierce] No, far from it. How do you feel? Fine. Like I've never zooted. It worked. Drug rehabilitation is a form of redemption Charlie. You're trying to tell me this was all part of the program. Yes. But you kept trying to reach out to me. Like something wasn't right. A guide to reassure you, to keep you going. No, no, Megan died. Barton worked at Infinity, they had my memory like something wasn't right. We had such a hard time with your loop because of your memory corruption. We had to create a part of your memory. Create? Charlie! Don't listen to him. Chuck, it's me your pal. Don't listen to him. Infinity are trying to fuck us over. They all are, welfare, everybody. Sorry Charlie, we had to create a part of your memory. Otherwise your looping would have crashed. Barton, Megan. Don't listen to him. Don't exist? Never did? I have no idea what's real or not anymore. Your dreams are real. The child abuse you suppressed is real. You needed to confront that. Chuck, you know what's real. You're real, Megan's real. I'm fucking real. Barton and Megan were just parts of your psyche battling to keep you grounded. Shut up. So what happens when I wake up? You completed the program. It's time to pull you out. Charlie? Charlie! Megan. Do I know you? I'm Charlie. Megan. It's beautiful here, right? Yeah. Are you from around here? Have you been to the restaurant up there? The restaurant? Yeah. I own the little restaurant up by the beach. You do, wow. Yeah, living the dream. You should pop by for a drink. Oh. I found this. Must have been some kid who left it here. You know what, you can have it. See you later. (exhaling) (funky technological music)
