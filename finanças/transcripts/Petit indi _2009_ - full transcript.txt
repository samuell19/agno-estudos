Hello. Arnau! Come and help me. You'll go see mom in prison tomorrow? - Okay, bye. - Bye. Sergi, the mail for your sister. Eat your spinach. Hello. - What's up, Cossard? - All good. You come to get your things? Are you planning to stay? I don't know, a few days maybe. - Could you lend me your car? - Sure. We need it tomorrow. I have an appointment with the administrator. That bastard raised the rent. Why don't you move? What? That's what they want. Hello, Pedro. "Penitentiary Center for Women" Consuelo Amado? - Who did he come to see? - Filo Arcs. That won't be possible. You want some? - Sergi, do we make one? - I'm coming. Mom is in solitary confinement for two months. They told Sole that she hit two guards. They always say that. - Just before the trial. - Shit! But Mom didn't do anything. Not for you, but for the system, yes. - We put that in his suitcase. - Tell it to the judge. - Hello. - Hello little one. - I don't believe you. - It is because lunch ... - Hi, how are you? - How are you? "The sale of finches is forbidden" Have you enrolled in the Catalonia championship? We must win. It will take place in Vallbona. Can we start? Yes, but he is missing Mr. Garcia. - I'm here! - Let's go! Ready? Go! Just go! It's good! Bring it to Sole. Right away! Hello. Sergi, did you see dad in Granada? Yeah. Could he help us with Filo? You know that he's not interested in anything anymore. Don't tell Sole that I saw him. This second procedure was considered close... However, the result is unexpected. No one imagined such a decision of the jury in this case, which aroused the general curiosity. You can see the escort of the innocent out of the exit. Beside him, his lawyer seems satisfied with the verdict. They will explain the sequence of events to the media. More tomorrow. As in the Sabater case of money laundering, Roca found a loophole in the investigation that incriminated .... Do you know where I could find a lawyer? No idea, ask the library. "Concepción Martinez dismissed. The lawyer makes the jury cry." "Rock Vilardell Lawyer" "Rock & Vilardell lawyers" How many hours have I done this month? I can work overtime. On Saturdays? No, we don't need anyone in maintenance. Arnau! You're coming? Do you need someone? The guy throws his life away traveling, and he doesn't care about it I can help you a little more. I was lucky at the races. The dog races? Look, we have to pay 3000 Euros to the administrator. How do I do that? Hello, Uncle Ramon. Hello, how are you? Wouldn't you like to live in town, in a comfortable apartment? - We don't like your neighborhood. - You prefer this? I want Mom to come back to the house as she left it.. I know, my sister. But it seems to me that this would not be the most important thing for her. Anyway, I'll leave you the owner's phone number. If you don't want to call, it won't be problem either. Uncle Ramon! If we were to leave, I would not be against it. In his neighborhood? It's full of pensioners and unemployed who spend all day watching the races. Hello, Pedro. Sole made them. Don't tell him we took it. You know someone who has a job for me? Are you in trouble? Could you recommend me to the airport? You're not old enough to be a falconer. I could be an assistant. Win the contest first, then we'll talk about it again. When do you go back to work? Next week, I have two nights left. - Then where will you go? - I don't know yet. - Hi, everything alright? - Hi, how are you? - What's up? - And you? - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go! - The idiot! - Let's go!

I made 800 this month, I can give you everything. No. 400. As usual. You keep the rest. Don't mix colors! I rather do it alone if you're doing it wrong.
