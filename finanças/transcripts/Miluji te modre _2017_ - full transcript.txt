Wake up... Wake up! Wake up! Go away, Mom. It’s 7:30... You overslept and it’s a beautiful day. Mom? Mom, are you listening? Mom! You said you’d wake me at 6 and now it’s almost 8! -Mom! -Why all the rush? I told you, today they’re bringing the paintings for the exhibition. -Really? -Yes, all the way from Holland. At your age, maybe you could set your own alarm. -You can’t always make me responsible. -Don’t make my morning any harder, okay? -And please drop that look. -What look? That one. You look like a sage or something. Thanks to the Swamiji’s teachings, I now know what’s essential. -Let me help you. -Thanks. -I’m leaving before we argue again. -When do you need to be there? -I’ll drive you. -No way! -Quit stalling and let’s go. -He doesn’t answer. -Karel, we should’ve been done ages ago. -Where is that artist of yours? -I’ve got goosebumps. Just relax, my dear tushies. Art is about suffering, right? Look out! You ran a red. That ringing is bugging me. Answer it. I can’t talk now. I’ll call you later, okay? Who was it? Well, who was it? -Your new girlfriend? -No, just Dad. We’re working on a project together. -What project? -Re-creating famous paintings. -I thought your dad only shot nudes. -You ever seen Venus or Danae? -Have you already undressed them? -Mom, just go! I’m not going anywhere. Just get out. -I got you to the gallery. -Fine, bye. Sorry, Dad, I’ll be there as soon as I can. Morning, Mr. Říha, has the shipment come? Yes, it’s in the depository. Hold on! -It’s something big, eh? -You’ll see. Bye! -Hi, Romana. -Hi. Is this everything? Where’s the rest of it? In Holland. They’re on strike. The rest is coming tomorrow. Aren’t you going to unpack it? I bet it’s a gem that will light up the otherwise empty gallery. -I’ll wait till tomorrow. -What do you mean? -Because of the strike. I’ve got a meeting in town, bye! Quit your drooling! -Hi, sorry... -Where’ve you been? We’ve been waiting forever! Today really sucks: I overslept, no shipment, the Dutch are on strike... -What do you have for me? -It’s not working out. It’s good while in motion but I can’t get a good shot. -We have to think of something. -What about painting them white? The projection would be sharper. What do you think, Petr? -You want to whitewash us? -Count me out. Hold on... We need three girls. That’s our concept, right, Dad? That’s how we express that there’s a Venus in every woman. -I thought only one gets born. -Wait... David, where’d you get that idea? A Venus in every woman? I’ve only ever met Sirens in my life. Hey, Karel, you can just find another Siren to play Venus! I’m not talking about you, Bětka. You’re the only Venus in my life, tushie. Hey, where’re you going? Come on! You can’t mess up the shoot! We gotta move on this. I’ll find the girls, you think of something. You know how long it took Botticelli to paint The Birth of Venus? -This isn’t the Renaissance. -Hey, look! -Beautiful! -Yep... Hair down her back, legs like a gazelle. I’m not talking about the girl; I’m talking about the display. That’s exactly what we need. Remember, God made woman last as the pinnacle of creation. So she’s perfect. Don’t just stand there staring at her. Get moving on it. I’ve got to run. -Well, are you going to talk to her? -I don’t know her. So introduce yourself. Now that you’re so tan, the Botswana acacia really stands out. How talented you are, Igor! -Clumsy, aren’t you? -Careful with those, they’re watches. I have to run to rehearsal. See you this evening, okay? Tell me how it looks from outside. Fantastic! Don’t spend too long on it. And be on time, I’ve got a great idea. Bye, ladies! Goodbye. Hello, may I help you? I’m just looking... Just looking? Is this a gallery or what? Mom, when will you finally stay out of my room and leave my paints alone? Why are you home? I saw that. Give it here. You know, following an Indian swami isn’t like making a cake. You okay? You’re an old Central European woman... -What do you mean old? -Your joints aren’t used to this. -Why aren’t you at work? -The Dutch are on strike; the paintings are coming tomorrow. No more questions, I’m in a hurry. -Can I? -Sure. Your display window really inspired me. We’re working on something similar; we’re re-creating famous paintings. By the way, I’m David Bárta. -You really like it? -It’s great. -You have great ideas. -You too. I’m just learning. I would never have thought of using blue. I was inspired by your display. Today we got stuck trying to shoot The Birth of Venus. Would you like to come see our studio? Sorry, but I have to run to a show. You’re going to the movies? I also wanted to invite you... No, not the movies. So come to the National Gallery; we’re setting up a great exhibition. -I really gotta run. -No, that’s for you. -Thanks, bye. Just a sec. I don’t even know your name. Can I get your number? I don’t like those kinds of movies. Hello. I know... That was great! Did you hear the applause? What the heck were you doing? I thought I was going to fall! -Why didn’t you tell me? -You were late; there wasn’t time. -So you tested it out live? -I’d never let anything happen to you. No? I think I know when something’s going on! -But I was holding onto you! -Well, just stop. -Everything okay, kids? -Sure. -Glad to hear it. Friends, I’ve got great news. The engagement in New York has been confirmed! Everything is last minute, so make sure you’re ready to travel. I don’t want to hear about any expired passports. -Cheers! -Super! -Thanks. -Anything wrong, Tereza? -It’s okay, I... -Can I interrupt? -Of course. -What’s wrong, Tereza? -I don’t know, it’s all too fast. An incredible career awaits us. What’re you worrying about? -We always dreamed about this. -You always did, Igor. I applied for school and I have a job here. You’re thinking about dressing windows now? You know how long we waited for this? Let’s go discover the world. I’ll hold onto you, don’t worry. Like you held onto me today? Hey, just cut the crap. Let’s celebrate! Tereza, you guys were great today. Yeah, but Igor is a loose cannon. He sure is. You’re the only one who can control him. I can’t even imagine you not going with us. Hold on there... There’s no way you’re not going. -And you’re not even drinking? -Of course I am. So live it up! -Good morning. -Good morning, doctor. -Well, Mr. Říha? Not here yet, but it’s expected any minute. There’s traffic on the highway. -Do you have something for me? -Oh, right... So what this exhibition? Something fantastic, I bet. It’s a turning point for our gallery. The first Czech exhibition of Dutch painter Van Brenkelen. He even painted a canvas especially for us. -He’s still alive, huh? -I hope so. He should be here by now. I thought you had to be dead at least 300 years to have a show here. How’re you doing otherwise? -I met a young woman. -No! She was yellow like a Miró and she ran like Chagall had painted her. Does she like to jog? No, but she ran away from me. -Hey, thanks. -A raven. -Now it’s my turn. -That’s right. Hey, they’re here! -Are you going someplace? -I’ve gotta do something. Anything wrong? No, but I need inspiration for a job. Forget about it, we’re soon out of here. Fine. Wait a bit and I’ll go with you. -Hi, David. -Hi. Another pick-me-up? Even bigger. Enjoy it. Jokes, huh? Well, the joke’s on you. The boss has been eagerly awaiting your arrival - since morning. That must be him again. If I were you, I’d get moving. Yes? Of course, be right there. Wait up, I’m going too. Let’s go then! Enter! Hello. What’s up? Did Van Brenkelen arrive? No, but the director wants to speak with you. You’re to wait for him in the French section. But I can’t now, the shipment is here. Mrs. Horová, do you know what’s so urgent? It’s just terrible, Doctor... The gallery must reduce staff. Apparently, you’re the youngest and most capable. You can get a job anywhere. -Anywhere? -Because you’re such a good painter. I wonder how many paintings he’s going to buy from me. Mr. Bárta, don’t tell him I told you. -Hello. -Hello. So you came... But the exhibition isn’t ready yet; the exhibits just came today. It doesn’t matter, I like it here as well. Me too. But then again it is my job. -I really like the blue one. -They used to make it from lazurite, which was more expensive than gold. The painter spared no expense. -Wasn’t it a waste? -No, not at all... since it’s so beautiful. Hey, I just thought of something. Follow me. This is the first one they brought. Shall we unwrap it? I didn’t expect this. I’ve only seen it in pictures. Do you like it? Beautiful, isn’t it? Tereza! Tereza! Tereza! Look! Look, we don’t need a big top, the world will lie at our feet, look! Tereza? Igor, cut it out! What are you doing up there? Do you always have to show off? This isn’t a circus. Igor, please come down! If you don’t come down I’m leaving. Get down from there! Did you hear me? Call security, I’ll watch him. Come down from there... Goddammit! Let’s go! Get him! He got away. Oh, god... Hey, I’ll take that! Please, just try to be careful. -What are you doing now? -I have to cut my hair. Wait! I’ll do it for you. Are you ok? Yes, thank you. Mr. Brenkelen? Yes, you must be Mr. Bárta, is that right? Yes, have you arrived? I apologise, I should have been here yesterday. I want to be present in person at the installation of my exhibition, especially the big canvas. I hope I'm not disturbing. You look strange. That's probably because I've been thinking a lot about your big canvas. Really? Great! Can we go there now? Sure! I think we should go see the director first. Yes? All right! Now, will you tell me what happened? Tereza... Thanks. I really love you. Stop it or I’ll cut your ear off. -Hands off! -What do I have them for? -To keep them off me. You see? Okay, now tell me what happened. As I was running away, I accidentally ran into a painting. -Did anyone get hurt? -No, not at all. So that’s why you wanted me to cut your hair. What can I do? We’re about to leave and I don’t want any trouble. Once again, other people have to solve the big shot’s problems. We can’t risk the tour over some bullshit. Who knows what happened? -That’s the point! Igor, act like a man. -What does that mean? -Go and apologize. -You gotta be kidding. Fine, whatever you want. The police have to catch that guy! Then they gotta give me 10 minutes with him, and I’ll tear him... exactly like that! Is it possible to inconspicuously restore it? Ridiculous, right? Miracles do happen but... I could turn comics into a Rembrandt, but that hole will always be visible. Damn! How am I supposed to show this to Van Brenkelen? He loans us his masterpiece and what do we do? Nick it or scratch it or even splash acid on it like a proper gallery? No, we let somebody jump through it! This hasn’t even happened at the Louvre. Van Brenkelen will tell the world what a bunch of losers we are. What can I tell him? And where the hell is Bárta? You better wait here. I'll get the director. Yes. - Excuse us, please. - Of course. Finally, the goof-off returns! What happened to you? This is what the painting looked like before we got it in our clutches. Sir. It’s all your fault! What do you have to say for yourself? Who are you? Who let you in here? -Don’t you speak Czech? -I’m Van Brenkelen. -Bárta, have you gone mad? -I ran into him outside. Why? Oh my God! Chair! Get him a chair! Who did it? Can anyone tell me who did this? Are you the director? Why did you bring him here? You explain, you artist! Mr. Brenkelen, I'm so sorry. I'm... Mr. Brenkelen, look at the depth of the painting now. It would be waste to repair it. Quick, put the gold behind it! No master of the quattrocento has brought so much light into the color! And they were all geniuses! And what about the spatiality? Look! After the golden cut this van Brenkelen cut will become sought-after classic! Maybe! And you can work with it further! Which artist can say, that he entered and exited his art? Yes, this kind of crash test can add depth. And poetry. Congratulation Mr. Brenkelen! Jackson Pollock is finally out! Yes, it's better like this! This adds new dimension, new expressivity, new dynamic! I simply needed new point of view! Anything is possible these days, but the young doctor is first class. Your handling of Van Brenkelen was pure genius. And although it’s like throwing a Picasso on the trash heap, I have to let you go. Pepa’s got kids and Romana is doing her doctorate. You’re the youngest and cleverest. You’re single; you can make a living as a painter. So how many of my paintings will you buy? Look, I receive a state salary and the gallery has a buying freeze. But you’re here for two more months and we’ll do everything we can for you. I don’t know why, but I find it hard to thank you. Wait here. I need to handle this myself. Good luck. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Can I get by? -Of course... I’m sorry. Hi, Dad. Excuse me, where can I find Mrs. Spáčilová? -First floor. -Thank you. Sorry, for not calling but I was in the director’s office. I got laid off. Sorry to hear it. But keep your chin up, things could be worse. At least you’ll have more time for our projects. The girls? They got mad and went nuts. Yeah, they mutinied. I tried to find other models, but the Americans are casting a movie and all the best girls are there. Well, find someone and bring her to the studio. Hold on... I see one... She’s as blue as lazurite. Gotta go, bye! Tereza, run! -What happened? -The police are coming! -Are you after me? -Of course. -I’ll scream. -No, just come with me. -Where? -Will you come? -What happened anyway? -Nothing... Some psycho jumped through a painting and left a huge hole. -What? -That’s right. -What’re you going to do about it? Nothing. I just got fired. Lord... Even my blood hurts. Hey, if you’re looking for someone I’ve got a sister. We’re twins. -Hey, this is your layoff notice. -Yep, it is. But you must admit, it’s nicer like this. Take this for good luck. Or give it to someone... Maybe your girlfriend. Whose girlfriend? Yours. If you don’t have one, give it to your next girlfriend. Well, okay. Thanks. -Hi. -Hello. Hi, Dad, this is Tereza. Hi. I’m Karel. Tereza. Nice... Now get behind the screen. And strip down, we’re ready to work. Move, you're holding us up! Okay, girls, let’s give it a try. Oh, I get it now. I thought... -Never mind. -Wait! There’s been a mistake! Dammit, Dad! That’s the girl from the shop window! I wanted to show her our work and you tell her to strip down! Sorry, but look on the bright side. I saved you time. Now you know she doesn’t drop her drawers so easily. Screw your advice! Do it yourself! Petr, got a picture of your sis? Sure. Let me see... Fine, she looks great. Can you give her a call? Sure, but today she’s at the Avatar casting call. I’m glad you’re here. The electricity is out again. I’ll take a look. It’s out again! -Hello, Mrs. Bártová. -Hello. Do you know what it could be? I have no idea. Hey, David, stop. The girls and I came to get you. We have to finish the project. I already told you to do it yourself. Forgive me... -I screwed up. -Sure did. Apologize to Tereza for me. -But I know you’ll think of something. -Leave me alone! We have to finish. Come on! Let’s go! That was a great idea. I knew you’d think of something. It’s funny. We were looking for a group of girls and in the end we used just one. Yeah, but the most beautiful. I pulled a fast one on the Americans. You can get dressed now... But you don’t have to if you don’t want to. -Hi. -Hi. Are we late? For the shoot, yes. But you’re right on time for the party. I hear you project images onto your models. No, they paint them white. -How many models did you call? -I did nothing else for two hours. This was important to me. Cheers! Start the presentation... Are you David? Enjoy life while you can. I invited them all for you, to get your mind on other things. -Let’s make a toast. -Sure, girls, lead the way. When I got there I realized they might really lock me up. Is that what you want? You wanna know what I want? For you not to have climbed on that sculpture. But I got an idea and I had to try it out. You’re like a child. I’m tired of being your minder. -I know. Don’t get so mad. -Mad? -Yeah. Don’t pretend you don’t know why! You ruined that painting and now that guy... ...that Mr. Bárta lost his job at the gallery. What Mr. Bárta? Hello... I... need to speak to Tereza. -Anyone could say that. -But this is about work. I have a job offer for her. Then leave your business card... if you have one. Czech National Gallery Quick, quick, quick! Let’s go! Let’s go! Move it! Let’s go, carry it upstairs! How much more? There’s no place to put it! So, Mom kicked you out too? I don’t understand how Mom can be so stupid about that swami. She’s pretty reasonable otherwise. Well, a lot of women latch onto asexual activities during menopause: alternative medicine, various sects... They fight for Tibet, grow organic vegetables, and even knit sweaters for penguins. My boy, there’s nothing else to do... -but get used to it. -Get used to it. How? Without exception, one thing works perfectly on all women. What’s that? Tenderness! Tenderness? You have to be tender with your mother. Yep! -Look how it works! -Fine, tender... Essscuuse mee... I know, tender... Tender I got to be. Mommy! -I love you, Mom. -You’ve been drinking! -Me? Wait, what are all these piles? Books of the Swamiji’s teachings. Tender... Tenderness is the key. -Why’re they here? -They’ll be here till we sell them. Wait... Here’s one for you, free of charge. -Thanks. -I put some in your room too. Think tenderness... You want to sell these horrid brochures to people? You see horror and I see light. You see the cover, I see the content. Tenderness! By the way, the Swamiji approved this brochure himself. My little one... Na-musty! Sorry, Swamiji! Hello, Bártová here... No, we haven’t started selling them yet. But why? But they said the Swamiji personally approved these brochures. He didn’t like them? Oh, well... So what should we do with them? Okay, fine. Hari Om. You really didn’t like them? Don’t you want to think it over? You should give off more light! I have to add my own. -Morning. -Doctor, I have something for you. And I have something for you: Sun in the soul, but watch out for that inner sun. -This is for you. -Nice, you got me. Not me. That young lady was here this morning. She’s kind of blue - and not nearly as green as you are. Now you tell me? Thanks! Thanks a million Mr. Říha! -It really improves hair quality? -Rest assured. Another beautiful display case. I’m glad you came... I feel bad about the painting. Don’t worry... At least now you know how to do origami. I just kept looking at yours. I’ve got lots to learn. You’re not mad anymore? It was a misunderstanding with my dad. I know it wasn’t your fault. I was sorry afterward. -I gave him a good thrashing. -Did he survive? What about your boyfriend? Igor’s not a bad guy. But he always has to be the center of attention. He has a wild soul. -Is he coming here? -Don’t worry, he’s not interested. He’s busy with our tour abroad. I keep wondering what your boyfriend Igor does. He’s an acrobat; that’s why he climbed up that sculpture. -You must have fun together. -Yeah, lots of fun. What did you finally do about that painting? You never told me. Because you took off. That’s fantastic! Really? -Scouts’ honor? -Scouts’ honor, I swear. -Well then, long live Van Brenkelen! -Yep! -Your boyfriend has more luck than sense. -That’s the truth. He has much less sense. How does it suddenly become a masterpiece? It all begins with just a point. A lightning flash... Okay, in this case a rip. That kind of hole in a picture is either a catastrophe or a brilliant idea. -It all depends on how you look at it. -You should’ve put it in a golden frame. Check this out. Your turn. Is this a game? Try connecting them. You could make a whole exhibition from these dots. For a long time I’ve had an idea for a book in my head. But it takes two. It’s all based on a game. -That’s me! -Yeah. -Like I’m looking in the mirror. “A woman’s face is the only mirror in which a man can look at himself.” -What beautiful nonsense. -No, it’s poet František Halas. -We had him in fifth grade. -See, you knew what to remember. -“If you hurt me, I’ll whistle.” -That’s from the movie Poets. Tereza, what if I gave it to you? Your life story must be hidden inside. Will you take it? I said to give it to your next girlfriend. Did you forget? Nope. Are you okay? We really bonked! Hey, right here’s the place where Czech executioner Jan Mydlář did his work. -I never thought I’d be a victim. -Well, thanks a lot! -Well? Will you take it? -I can’t. -You’re so hardheaded! -You should know! What a mess of papers. Where’s that damn power of attorney? Come here... Sign on the first line. I need Tereza to do the same. -Where is she anyway? -I don’t know. There she is now with some guy. That’s where I live. Maybe you shouldn’t come any further. Will we see each other again? I can’t promise anything. -I’m probably leaving on tour. -For how long? -A long time. -Far away? -Far away. Overseas. Looks like a decent guy. -Hey, he’s giving her something. -I’ll give him something... It’s impossible. -But I had a great time with you. -Me too. Bye. Who’s that guy? Tereza, who’s that guy? Since you’re so interested, he’s the guy from the National Gallery. -It’s okay about the painting you ruined. -I didn’t ruin anything! -Oh, really? Guess I misunderstood. What painting? What did you do now, you psycho? -Nothing. -You didn’t brag about it? Out with it. You know we have an agreement. If you screw up again, you’re gone! Or rather, you’re staying. -Anything to drink, gentlemen? -We’d like a bottle of champagne. Right away. This is the best kind of reading; actually, it’s the only thing I read. So what’s going on with Tereza? She’s taken. She’s probably leaving with her boyfriend Igor. -So you have a rival. -What’s so great about that? A rival brings out your best. Dad, he’s insane! -So she isn’t available. -No. How about if I find you a substitute? -I mean, just temporarily. -Dad, I’m really in love. At your age? How old are you anyway? -33. -Christ already hung from the cross. That’s what I feel like. -Dad, I need a plan. -“Once more unto the breach”! Thanks a lot. Last time you told me to be tender and that was a joke. Each battle requires its own weapon. Stop sighing! Your mom always sighed and I ran away from her. You mean you ran away from us! You left me like some genetic hostage. Yeah, yeah, yeah... She was a normal, neurotic woman. And today she’s happy. How many can say that? -But she makes me unhappy. -Let your mom do what she wants. Look after yourself and don’t let any woman manipulate you. You can’t be afraid of them. What are you doing?! I can’t let that bleached blonde see me! Dad! I gotta get out of here! And if you want Tereza, fight for her. -Shall I bring your entrées? -Yes. -For two? -Sure, I just need to arrange something. -Hello? -Evening, Tereza. Evening. I was just thinking about you. Really? That’s nice. -Want to think about me and be with me? -What do you mean? I’m inviting you to dinner. -When? -Now. I’m at Žižkov Tower. Do you like Châteaubriand? -Give me that! -What are you doing? Dinner, huh? You’re the guy from a gallery, right? Sure, let’s dine together. Wait for me there! What are you doing, Igor? You’re crazy! If you leave I’m not going with you anywhere! Yes, you are! Because you’re the woman I love and I need you! Should I warm it up? -What? -Can I warm it up for you? Yes... I’ll be back in a minute. Come on, Mom, answer the phone... Answer it... Come on... Hello? It’s just like your father... This is how it turns out when he arranges things. -Good evening. -Good evening. I’d been sitting too long so I asked Mr. Čapek for help. -Get in, get in! -What’s this all about? -If we stay, blood will be spilled! -Whose blood? You always reproach me for not considering you... -Where’d you learn to drive like this? -Watching movies like Fast and Furious. Look out! The light was red. But in reality, your dad takes off and I come running. That’s a fact! -Hari Om. -Wanna sit in back? No, just drive. We’ll talk at home. I can tell you where your suffering comes from. You’re too fixated on material existence. If you meditated daily... Mom, stop with the yoga. I already tried it... Yeah, two years ago and you broke up with Romana. -Try it again. -I can’t stand that Indian stuff! I’d like a normal Czech mom. -I second that. -Well, Mr. Čapek! But I want grandkids. I prayed to the Virgin and nothing! -Maybe the Swamiji is working on you. -Maybe he’s jerking me around. You’re the smartest one in the room, right? Well then, you can wake your own self up in the morning! -Good morning. -Good morning. - Hello Mr. Brenkelen. - Hello to you. - Nice to see you. - How are you? - Good and you? - It's not bad, good! - Please sit. - Thank you. We still have to do some paperwork. Thank you. - Ok, a signature please. - Of course, sure. And we have to add the name of the painting you'll give us instead of the ripped one. I have a new name for the pierced painting. "Hymen." Human penetration! Ok, and... What about the new painting? Yeah, I call it "Liquefied jeans." I really like that! Play with what's already here and look at it with a new set of eyes. One moment. - Arcimboldo! - Correct! You know, I have a concept for a book... about fine art. But no dates or names, only pure game. Interesting. Talk to me. Sorry... I got a little carried away. Tereza... It’s the guy from the gallery, isn’t it? No. It’s you. Well? Still not answering? -You said you know where she lives. -Yeah, sure. -Come on, let’s go. -Wait, what if Igor’s there? You almost ate dinner with him last night and now you’re afraid? Come on! I hope he’s not home too. Who knows what he’ll do? No one’s home. What if he did something to her? Locked her up? Or maybe they took off to Las Vegas to get married. Maybe her corpse is floating down the Elba... Just slow down there. Look! Let me see... Make the address bigger... -Maybe that’s it. Let’s go! -Hold on! Only us two? You were excited I had a rival. The fight is on! Come on! -Well, well! -Hello! -Nela, what are you doing here? -Performing. What telepathy - I thought about you all week and I meet you here. -Don’t exaggerate. -Did we already miss something? -One number. -Sorry to hear it. -Don’t worry... -I’m happy to see you. -Go on, we’re about to start. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! We need a volunteer from the audience for our next act. -Me! -You, Miss? No! -I’ll do it. -You, Sir? Fine! We applaud your courage. Come on up! Good evening! Come with me... This is for dinner... Does he ever miss? Only if he wants to. Come sit down here... How does it look? It’s bleeding a little. -It’s not very deep. -Okay, thanks. -Are you okay? -Me? Standing up to Igor? You’re crazy! -Know how much he drank yesterday? -How much? -Don’t even ask. We argued. -Thanks. Tereza, I’ve been looking for you all day. -I was worried about you. -About me? I have to perform. It’s not over yet. You should go. Stay right here. Hand me that... It’ll be okay, you’ll see. -I’m so sorry... -It’s okay, you’re very kind. -Are you okay? -I think so. -Come on, let’s go. -Are you going? A love gash... I’ll take him home to be safe. Then I’ll come back for you, okay? Well, hero, let me see. Ugh! I’m gonna call you Vincent. Igor, what was that improv with the guy all about? Is it my fault Tereza let him cut ahead of her? Of course. All that matters is that you were the big star today. Fine, I went too far, but I had it under control and nothing much happened. -Really? -Yeah. -You’re the only one who thinks so. This is the last time. Did you hear me?! The last time! I’m going. -See you later. -Bye. Tereza! What’s going on? I’m counting on you. It’s worse and worse with Igor all the time. We all know that, but you’re one of us. I seriously don’t know if I’m going or not. We’re not discussing this! I got you a ticket and a visa. Get back in there! -Hands off me! -Come now! -Roman! What the hell are you doing, man? I’m doing this for you! -Don’t talk to women like that! -Aha... So you’re just letting her go? Unbelievable... I can’t believe what Igor did tonight; it gives me the shivers. A little cognac will fix that. An older vintage... Here’s to happiness and to love! The adrenaline of love is the creative energy of art. -Are you quoting some poet? -No, I’m quoting myself. I need a break... -Good morning. -I have something for you. -Thanks, very nice. -Hold on... Someone’s waiting for you near the Impressionists. A beautiful girl in blue? An old man in purple. Oh, okay... Thanks! Housmann, a top publisher, wants to publish a book in the form of interactive game. Puzzles, etc. Guggenheim will be over within a year. But, I can't do the book by myself. It's based on a game of two people and... - And I don't know if Tereza... - A muse! Muses are elusive and the kisses are sweet. - Ask her and you'll see. - All right. The book is based on a game between two people. I’m turning it down. I don’t want to do it without Tereza. -You don’t turn down such an offer. -But I can’t do it alone. -Maybe you won’t have to. -Yeah? So where is she? I’ve been trying to find her all week. The super is suspicious; last time he almost called the police. You can’t give up so easily. Maybe she needs a few days to straighten things out in her head. You know women... “Don’t look for me, I’m with friends” - Nela. -But Nela left. -Yep, Nela did... Hold on - you know something. I’d go see Tereza if I were you. She is home now. Okay, thanks! Is it you? I finally found you! I came to thank you. I would’ve bled out without you. -I’m returning the bandaging material. -That’s so nice of you. Wanna come in? What a beautiful dress. It’ll go with the bracelet. Can I try it on? I was afraid you’d left. -I couldn’t find you anywhere. -I almost did leave. -Can you tie it for me? -Of course. Your hands are trembling. Are you afraid of me? No, why? They’re coming to read the gas meter tomorrow at 10! I was ready to fight. Igor, Nela - they’re all so far away. Can we use first names? After all, you did risk your life for me. -Tereza. -David. New friends get kisses. Just one! You’re not befriending the whole world. Tereza, I’ve got an offer for you... I mean for us... I have an offer we can’t refuse. A contract? We got an offer to do the book about fine art. Tereza, I don’t want to do it with anyone else. As a joke, fine. No, I’m serious. It’ll be like the game with the dots. But I don’t know how to write a book. -True, I did like the game with the dots. -So, okay? Yeah, okay. Tereza! I guess I’ll be going... I guess I should. Do you wanna stay over? That’s so wonderful... It’s unbelievable... When the time is right I’ll turn you over. Love is play, the same as that book of yours. What do you mean my book? It’s our book, isn’t it? It won’t contain anything you don’t want or approve. Okay, if it’s like that, you can turn over on your back. You’re a surprisingly talented pupil... and ambitious. Let’s not stop till I get an A. Maybe we can take a little break. Okay, but just a little one. Three, two, one... Hey, just relax. If David’s anything like me he’ll be home soon. He’s got other concerns now. Yeah? As far as I know you haven’t been home for 20 years. I took off 20 years ago, and I’m taking off now. I never had such a pretty teacher before. What’s my grade point average? That little warm-up quiz at the beginning? You get a D. You get an A for theory, but I figured as much. But putting it into practice is about a C. But, my dear student, I think the full two-hour exam saved you. You took the initiative, you were active... and you were very innovative... But you could use practice. Know anyone who could help you? Overall you get a B, maybe a B-. And that’s because of the shout out during the lesson! Well, okay, thanks for the verbal evaluation. It’s obvious you subscribe to the latest pedagogical trends. And now the student will evaluate the teacher, okay? Preparation for the first class... I admit, the improv really worked. You get an A. Did it involve years of practice? Hey, corporal punishment was outlawed years ago! Tereza... I love you. This is how I love you, Tereza! -Like the blue heavens? -Yeah, heavenly blue! And green and red and yellow too! But mainly when you look up into the heavens you have to agree. I think I do. It’s deep, blue, heavenly, hopeful, cosmic, never-ending! You know, you’re right. In a word, I love you heavenly. -Is your mom an alcoholic? -What makes you think that? Because she’s... she’s... Just tell me straight. No, my mom’s a yoga-holic. She’s just been sitting too long. Let me help you. Thanks. Mom, this is Tereza. Hello. Nice to meet you. Come, I’ll show you around. Swamiji, thank you. So much. I’ll be over in a minute, Jarouš. I roasted us a goose. Is it okay? Yeah, it’s good. Come on, Dad! Give it a rest! What? I’m creating... Subtitled by John Brent
