Present in these studios with president Dorticos members of the politburo of the party's central committee of the revolutionary government of mass organisations press delegates and other guests. Before you Commander Fidel Castro. On previous occasions we informed of... When on the 9th February 1970 Fidel Castro speaks to the television to inform Cubans of the current state of the zafra the sugar cane harvest He is worried. All is well in the western provinces but problems have emerged in the east. After all, they're aiming for an extraordinary amount. Ten million tons not a pound less. Fidel fixed this norm much like an athlete fixes their aims at the height of the world record. No half successes. It's either the record or a failure. Why sugar cane? Because after unfortunate experiences the Cuban leaders concluded the only resource that is immediately exportable and indefinitely renewable in Cuba was sugar. Why ten millions? Because it's the figure that will allow Cuba's economy to take off. Its foreign debt to Socialist countries and the technology it needs can only be bought in strong currencies. Why this year? Because the World Sugar Treaty And the bilateral deal with the USSR demand planning and that plan was set at ten million tons for 1970. But Cuba expected to achieve it gradually. They did not reach their target. The 1969 harvest was 4.5 million. Less than half. Therefore, where a reasonable progression and everyday efficiency have failed voluntarism appears as a response. All energies are mobilised The entire population will participate. And it is this, Fidel adds, without hurting any other sectors. He calls it 'the simultaneous battle.' There's concern, but not pessimism. To start with, it's not in his nature. And also because he has widespread popular backing and this could help him amend the situation. His reply to the last question of the journalist we're lagging behind. We have a tight deadline. A million tons every 17 days is serious. But as far as reaching the tenth million it's not a problem. No problems. THE BATTLE OF THE TEN MILLION CUBAN DOCUMENTS COLLECTED BY CHRIS AND VALERIE MAYOUX This year Cuba is not particularly fashionable. Europeans like us love to see communities rising up. only as long as they're full-blown martyrs or absolute victors. When they no longer wave a passionate manifest or perform a militant theatre when the struggle plays out on the drab decor of everyday life of everyday hardships with all their unpleasantness we turn away from them. Like aging actresses who marry ever younger men we marry ever younger causes. We search for a younger face for our dreams. - Bye. - See you later. There's another attitude that appears just as frequently well established through 50 years of liberal-minded tourists to refuse to see reality. When a reality that becomes irksome ceases to exist. One variant is to confidentially admit that yes of course it exists. But to discuss it would only benefit the enemy. By showing everyday images of Cuba OUT OF STOCK endless lines, supply shortages its NO HAY, or 'we've run out' a ubiquitous mantra If we say that Cuba is going through hardships and problems, That there is discontent, annoyances. are we putting weapons in the hands of the enemy? A first attempt to answer this question These images come from a Cuban film. Take-Off at 18:00hs by Santiago Alvarez And these words were spoken as you will hear, by Fidel Castro. If this poverty of everyday life betrays certain miscalculations insufficient attention paid to people's real needs, It also reveals a choice that needs to be understood. To prioritise infrastructural products over commodities. Rationing is also a choice that machines have made. along with technology, investment which will in turn transform everyday life. In the end, Cuba remains a country at war. We can't forget that when making a balance. A besieged city is not a lovers' court. Under an embargo that has it cut off from its own continent. Threatened by an enemy whose shores lie 144km away from its own. Cuba is embroiled in a double combat. To build, and defend what is being built. A modern army is an imposed need An education and health policy modern agriculture, are its chosen needs. And a new concept the feeling of not being alone in this combat. Solidarity with other poor countries. Especially those in Latin America. The last Sunday in May an earthquake devastates a region in Peru. 50,000 dead. They call for blood donors. Over 100,000 Cubans come to give theirs along with Fidel Castro. Peru is a 'pueblo hermano' a community in fraternity with them American fraternity But also a fraternity of underdevelopment. # Oh, Alert # Alert, peoples of the world # see the pain sowed # the hardships of war # in a corner of the world # let's forget for one second # the claws of Uncle Sam # reach all the way to Vietnam # with homicidal tendencies # who don't care about human life # or about those who fall # stop that knife-wielding hand # kills the dreams of children # and the ideals of this land # than to bear the horrid stain # of rifles, of heroism # let's make of Socialism # a strong and triumphant treaty # the universal flag of Marxism-Leninism The aid to Peru has a political meaning Its new government it has taken up the fight against US imperialism Revolutionary analysis is shared by many South Americans The USA is enemy nr 1 Their foreign aid is a form of pillage It's they who block any possibility of actual progress in Latin America. Cubans have quite a bit to say about this. About the Bay of Pigs' mercenaries and the young diplomat who visited in 1955 to congratulate Batista for keeping a stable government and a flourishing economy. His name was Richard Nixon. It's this solidarity in the face of a two-headed enemy: underdevelopment, and American imperialism, which explains the constant flights between Cuba and Peru The choice is simple. Choosing one's enemies is always simple. Unlike choosing one's friends. Obviously if there's no menace greater to the Cuban revolution than the USA. There is no greater help than that of the USSR. Is this the end of Cuban originality..., or Cuban heresy, Is it the alignment of the most gifted country never to become a satellite On the 22nd of April, for Lenin's centenary, Fidel Castro responds ...is to say, that the existence of the Soviet state is objectively one of the most extraordinary privileges of the revolutionary movement. What do I mean by this? I mean... that we can disagree on different issues that certain revolutionary movements can see and respond to things in a certain way while others will proceed differently. What I don't mean is... that all parties need to think alike. Let's not get thing mixed up. The issues are so wide-ranging and complex that there will always be infinitely different points of view. To say anything else would be an idealism. What we are referring to is of the plague of pseudo-revolutionaries writers pay rolled by Imperialism who criticize the Soviet Union and can't seem to forgive them their existence. Question posed to Cubans on the eve of Lenin's centenary. If Lenin was alive today here, among you, what would you say to him? - Who? - Lenin? The founder of Socialism in Russia? To Lenin? That would be something else, wouldn't it? I'd greet him first of all. Then I'd invite him to the ballet. Then I'd listen to him. I'd ask about his life I'd be happy to chat with him. Me? I don't know about such things. I'd be moved. I don't know. What I'd be interested in, is to hear him talk with Fidel. I'd ask him about Vietnam. I would help him with anything he didn't know how to do. To tie a hook for instance. to fix a line. Tell him where you can catch good fish. It's among these people that the Battle of the Ten Million is being fought. On the eve of its starting day No one will really know whether Fidel considered they could lose it. Or if whether they win or lose, in the face of underdevelopment... any battle is already a victory. The Year of Ten Million Not a Pound Less 14 July 1969 Central Gutierrez in Oriente There are 30,000 macheteros largest agronomer fair of the world. Working Comrades of Oriente and of the country Comrades, macheteros, Today begins the harvest of the Ten Million Fidel announces the kick off of this zafra and will not end until the last of ten million sacks has been filled. ...it's important to highlight... that this zafra starts today and won't stop until we've loaded the last sack of the ten million This zafra will last a whole year. It will mobilise Cubans in their hundred thousands. Labourers, employees, civil servants across all ranks of this cycle from the blow of a machete to the trip to the centrals The first dilemma concerns automation in Khrushchev times they'd considered Russian machinery to cut the cane Cuban technicians came up with two models. In fact these machines do exist. but they've been absent on the cane front. Manufacturing and maintenance problems problems establishing what kind of terrain they are appropriate for Problems. Fidel said in 1968 The day that this country has no men still using a machete the revolution will have realised its most humane task transform a task worthy of beasts into a human one. On the 23 of Dec the first million is achieved, though with some delay. Alarming news is reaching Oriente. The mobilisation had centred around manual cane-cutting, yet problems arose where they were least expected: on the industrial front. The old factories had no problems. Their throughput had always exceeded the speed of regular zafras. These ten million, require more shredding. A shortage of specialised workers leads to the growth of old centrals instead of constructing new ones. It's in these transformed factories that problems pile up. delays in upscaling... Difficulties in delivery, inadequate transport, poor loading practices, machine defects that paralyse each step after cane-cutting. And finally, these disquieting news that the enlarged centrals besides having poor shredding rates also extract less sugar from the cane. Yields are becoming a problem Seasonal rains on Havana and Camaguey, are not making things easier. Fidel Castro airs a speech for Feb 9th. At length, with maps and graphics he explains the situation and insists on improving yields. Because cut cane and shredded cane aren't exactly the same cane. The sugar content varies from the time the cane is cut to the time it is shredded. Besides this delay, shredding quality also makes a difference. Many factors add up to the final figure. They can turn a ton of cane as calculated on paper into quite a bit less on the ground. This phenomenon is not known or understood well enough puts the entire battle at risk. If we neglect the importance of all this, says Fidel, we risk wasting all our cane hoping to make ten million but obtaining 30 or 40 tons less. But we said here we'd make ten million tons not a pound less. So that is the question. As a reminder. It would be an awful embarrassment not to hit the ten million mark. And yet the yields keep dropping. The only way to know what is going on how much is coming out of the fields and of the factories is obviously to compare figures. But to compare means transporting tons of sugar cane between factories in a country where transport is always a problem in the midst of a battle where every minute counts. What's important is what will be done. From February on this sugarcane route from factory to factory with all the coordination required. And the first outcomes seem encouraging. In just days, Camaguey's output increases by 1%. While waiting for the 5th million the halfway mark, we can still expect the second half is still doable. But throughout the month of March the yields seem to drop steadily. They consider resorting to their cane reserves to compensate for the lower yields by increasing the shredding speed. And there's a new blow. Sugar cane seems to be depleted. The planning had been too optimistic. The slogans haven't changes. We're going ahead. In Cuba, like in Vietnam, we'll get the ten million. But it's mathematically certain that the battle is lost. WE WILL FULFILL OUR PART WITH HONOUR THE GIANT ZAFRA OF 10 MILLION TONS UNTIL THE VICTORY ALWAYS. And now another enemy will rear its ugly head. Who are these horrid people? what are they doing here? I'll talk to one of those mercenaries. Believe me, gentlemen, I felt revolted. An ideological vacuum. These captured mercenaries The anti-Castro organisation Alpha 66 decides to avenge them. And near the Bahamas, they take the crew of two fishing ships hostage who belonged to the coop in Caibarien. This act of piracy is taken seriously by the Cubans especially as their fishing fleet was created by the revolution. Cuba had never had one before. Fishing is the lifeline for 20 million people. That's why the fate of these fishermen had to be protected by all means. To neglect this is to admit that this country hasn't the right to defend itself. and that is intolerable. Anyone can understand this. Anyone. Even a bourgeois diplomat should be able to understand. Even the dumbest idiot. This country is muscular and firm in its refusal to be scared. If we show any hesitation or recoil in the face of imperialism it would be the way it is among voracious fish in the sea. I was chatting with comrades from the Ministry of Interior Anyone who's done any fishing knows how barracudas behave. They appear, and if you start swimming away from them I'll tell you about one of the first times I went diving. I had just discovered the ocean bed I was delighted, and I found myself alone, quite far from the boat, when a barracuda started swimming around me in circles showing me its teeth. I immediately retreated towards the boat. It was a very cautious move. But the barracuda got more aggressive all the time. So I felt embarrassed. for being there retreating from a barracuda. I turned around and swam towards it. It rushed out of there right away. ...it ran away at once. Since then... we'd already... learned that lesson from our struggle against Imperialism It's only after the revolution that a fisherman showed me the sea. Before that, like many of our comrades I'd never done any underwater fishing whatsoever. Mind you, I'm not trying to do advertising for that sport much less about myself. I'm just recounting my experience. And many animals are like that. They only now they're predators when their prey runs off. ...they get all puffed up for the chase. Imperialism is to us like a shark a sawfish, a vulture... It's all those beasts ...put together. If our little country, facing up to Imperialism had displayed signs of fear or doubt they would have swallowed us up. So what happened to these fishermen? What theories did they dream up? Naturally, it came from the US. From Washington. The Washington theory is that the demonstrations which are being held before the American embassy are a logical outcome of the zafra affair. This is a 'reuter' from Washington. Here's a cable from Washington. Now there's a reuter from Havana. The Swiss ambassador, representing US interests Discusses what would happen if Swiss boats confronted Cuban boats When you represent the USA, says Fidel, One shouldn't think of living without worries. The former embassy of the USA in Havana looked like a besieged fortress today. encircled by a true army of 20,000 Cubans trying to overcome the resistance of its defenders. This 'siege of Jerusalem' or Jericho, without the trumpets. As for the resistance they could meet down there there were no real young trumpets. The few early demonstrators grew to 100,000 when it emerged that the fishermen had been found on an islet of the Bahamas. Seeing the turn of events their aggressors had left. We need to wait for a new check. # in search of the fishermen The 11 fishermen are about to return to the kind of mass welcome party that other people reserve for their rockstars or their victorious football players. Poet Pablo Milanes himself declares that the people have won the match 11 - nil. A formidable popular demonstration... They say they freed the fishermen They lie. It's not the mercenaries who freed them. They freed themselves. They just abandoned them where they were. And they hurried back to their spot in Miami. It's one of the many low blows. They've lied and slandered in the past We were going to end the demo by invading their embassy... We were about to do this, or that... and the last thing they dreamed up... that we'd organised all these mobilisations to trigger an incident because of the difficulties with the zafra. And it's true that we have troubles. But are we going to blame it on someone else? On the imperialists? No. Not even on the mercenaries who moored here to disturb the zafra. Not even on those wretched CIA agents who kidnapped the fishermen. No. If someone has to take on the blame, it's us. And if you want me to describe the situation clearly we simply won't make the ten million. Quite simply. I won't beat about the bush. The ten-million slogan has been replaced by Fidel with a new one. To transform misfortunes into a victory For this last phase of the battle we were in Oriente, an island inside the island. Out on the horizon, the central pours out its fumes. The macheteros in Colorado leave for work at 5 a.m. on a bowl of coffee and a piece of dry bread. They hold out until noon under the tropical sun. They eat rice and vegetables drink tepid water that tastes of fuel, and then in the afternoon they sleep. Fresh water is a treat. A bouquet of flowers, a party. Some have lived like this for 11 months. When Fidel speaks again on the 26th of February It's mainly to them. This... thing I brought here. is not a speech. This is not a speech, not by any stretch of the word. It's a top secret report about the economic situation. It's not a speech, but economic secrets. It's one of these things that get written ...written and discussed in secret so that the enemy doesn't find out. And so, here we have them. Not because we particularly want the enemy to know. But who cares about the enemy? And if the enemy benefits from anything we say here and this turns out to be an embarrassment for us Blessed be this embarrassment. Bless this pain... if we can turn this embarrassment into a strength. If we can turn it into work. Turn it into dignity... If we can turn this shame into a moral factor. So in the end what we have here... And now here are the secrets. It's a painful result for the Cubans. With 8.5 million tons a record amount the battle of the 10 million has nonetheless been lost. And so has the simultaneous battle. The massive effort to produce sugar has thrown the other sectors out of balance milk production has dropped by 25% tyre production by 50% soap by 32% Fidel provides all the figures But his speech contains a dilemma What you will hear has probably never been said by any head of state in history. Certainly not in this tone. It's plain to see... The enemy has used and abused the argument... according to which the zafra of the ten million would lead to this kind of problems. Our duty was... to do the impossible to avoid it, but in truth ...we were unable to do so. Our enemies say... ...we have difficulties. And on this point they're right. They say we have problems. And in truth... ...they are right, our enemies. They say there is discontent. And in truth, they are right. ...our enemies. They say there is irritation And in truth, they are right, our enemies. As you can see, we are not afraid to admit it... ...when our enemies are right. We'll start by pointing out... ...in the first place, among all these problems the responsibility we all carry and mine specifically. I won't pretend, by any means... ...to call anyone out without assuming my own responsibility and the same goes for... ...all the leaders of the revolution. It is very unfortunate... that this kind of self-criticism can't easily go hand in hand with adequate solutions. It might be better to say... to the people, go find another one. Or even... go and find others. It might be better ...but in fact, on our side it would also be... a hypocrisy I believe that the learning process we, the leaders, have experienced was too high a price to pay. And sadly... ...our problem is not to replace the leaders... ...of the revolution This is something the people can do when they want, at the time of their choosing... and this very moment if that's what they want. What's the part... ...that impressed you most in Fidel's speech? What he said about workers' role in management. about giving workers much more participation in labour management issues. So what is it... .. we found in the spirit of the Santiago workers? Being as we were, aware of all their difficulties? Firstly their preoccupation with production issues. With an incredible passion for their factory and its production process. ...tremendous. In ragged clothes... with holes in their shoes... These workers in rags and torn shoes. Demanded all sorts of things: machinery, precision tools, They were more worried about that... ...than the other problems. With supplies in such a poor state... ...they worried more about the factory's yields than about their unmet individual needs. And that is very moving. This is for us... a true lesson, real living proof that... the proletariat, the industrial proletariat, the truly revolutionary class. The class that might... ...have the most revolutionary potential of all. What a practical lesson... ...lesson in Marxism-Leninism. We who are taking our first steps on the revolutionary road not from a factory, which would have benefitted us all most. But through an intellectual itinerary of a theory-fuelled spirit... ...based on thought. And wouldn't it have been convenient... for all of us to know our factories better. To make them our starting point. ...of the factories. Because it is there... ...that one finds an authentically revolutionary spirit as described by... ...Marx and Lenin And that is the spirit of the immense majority. Who cares about those few freeriders who often have only just arrived to the world of work. Who cares about absenteeism sometimes the conditions are so bad that those who surprise us are not those who don't show up but those who do After an 8-day visit we explained all this to the people and said, Do you know anyone... who is dependable and can take on responsibilities. It's our question to the masses. because what really is tragic one of the tragedies of our country, must not be cause to resign ourselves. It's the problem of finding executives who can provide oversight... with an adequate level of education and intelligence. For complex production-related tasks. Some elements had been mentioned earlier. Sure, but it went deeper and it was expressed more clearly. We do not believe that the issue of managing a factory should be left to a mere administrator. It's high time that we introduced many more criteria and ensure someone is in charge. and is accountable to answer questions. But the factory should be shaped into... ... a collective organism. Why? Why should an executive be... ultimately in charge of a factory? Why not introduce to the governing board representatives of the workers' collective Why not trust them? Why not trust the formidable proletarian spirit of these men? These barefoot, ragged men... ...who keep production going. What part of Fidel's speech impressed you the most? All of it, the whole speech. Every sentence had a meaning. It's not a matter of mechanically accumulating overtime No. The problem has been clearly stated. The norm is the standard working day. Used diligently Overtime is the exception and only when it's justified by force majeure. When a specific target must be reached. Not to squeeze an extra hour into an abstract norm. Those mechanical methods are nothing but dirty tricks. We need to understand for once and for all that a mechanical attitude and that we've accumulated nonsense. Our problem is creating awareness among our entire people. How can we optimise the use of those machines? For each gramme of prime matter From every atom of energy And use our heads to think. If the big zafra had been a problem to be solved with more arms I'd say that what we are dealing now is one to be solved with more brains. A problem of intelligence. The way ahead is hard, indeed. Harder than it seemed. Yes, my imperialist gentlemen Socialism is hard to build. But Karl Marx himself conceived of it as the natural consequence of a society that was already technologically developped. However, today in the face of industrialised capitalist powers countries like ours have no other way out. There's no other way to catch up cultural and technologically than Socialism. But what is Socialism? It's the chance to make optimal use the human and natural resources available to the people. What is Socialism? It's the disappearance of the opposition between the development of productive forces and production relations. Today, the industry, prime matters natural resources, factories machines, and all sorts of equipment belong to the collectivity. They can and must be in service of the collectivity. If we don't make the most of these machines of those facilities and resources it's not because a capitalist is standing in our way. It's not because an imperialist is in the way. It's not an owner who's in the way. If we don't make the most of our possibilities it's not because someone isn't letting us it's because we don't know, don't want or cannot. Our enemies rejoice They have their hopes set on our difficulties. And I said they were right. About this, and that, and such. About whatever they like. Except on one point. To think that the people have an alternative to the Revolution. It's to think that the people when faced with the difficulties of the revolution whatever these may be would be able to choose the route of counterrevolution. That's where you've got it all wrong, my imperialist gentlemen. That's where you're wrong. We're not out for praise. or power What is power for anyway? If one doesn't win the battle against poverty. against ignorance and all those things. Power. What is power? What is this or any other power? It's the will of the people. If we have an atom of self-worth in us this atom will have the value of an idea the value of a cause in union with a people. And we, men we're made of flesh and blood fragile beyond belief. We are nothing, so to speak. If we are something it's only in relation to those things. Once again... all I have to say... to our people... on behalf of our party and all the leaders And also... in accordance with my own feelings faced with the people's reaction its attitude and trust all I have to say is many thanks. Fatherland or death. We shall prevail. subs by Adua
