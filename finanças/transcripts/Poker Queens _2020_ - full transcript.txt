I think we're gonna have conflict on this hand. - All right, get 'em all in there. Indeed, all 50,000 goes in. Makes it $100,000 pot. If Daniel wins this, he's back in the running again. - All right, brother. I'm goin' all in. - Okay, whaddya got? He's got two queens and Crandall just turned over two nines. Only one card away from being the world champion and it's the 10 of diamonds. Bobby Baldwin is world champion. He got it! He got it, he got it. He's a shocked, amazed man. He's the world champion of poker, Jack Straus. Stuey wins the tournament. Stu Ungar has won three World Series of Poker. - Scotty's got a nine. - Scotty's got a nine. Scotty's our new world champion. And there it is. Hellmuth wins the championship. So Phil gets the money. Scott Blumstein is the 2017 world champion. That's the call and that is the tournament. John Cynn can now call himself Main Event champion. Martin Jacobson has his breakthrough win. He has climbed the mountain and is poker's world champion! Sweden's first Main Event champion is a worthy one. They say that the game of poker takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. But it only takes about 30 seconds to notice that almost all poker players are men. The biggest poker competition in the world happens every year in Las Vegas. It's been going strong for more than half a century. It's called the World Series of Poker. Winning a bracelet in the WSOP Main Event is the most prestigious prize in poker. Using skill, mathematics, aggression, creativity, intuition and luck, players knock each other out of the game until there's only one table left: the final table. Only one woman has ever made it to the final table of the Main Event at the World Series of Poker in all of its first 50 years: Barbara Enright. Welcome to the West here in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the 1995 World Series of Poker. - These six players, there are five men and one woman and this is the first time that a lady has gotten to the finals. Sitting at the final table was a huge accomplishment for Barbara Enright. But when Barbara went all in with her pocket pair. Barbara's got two eights. She was called by a guy holding arguably one of the worst hands in poker. Brent has a six three of diamonds. Six three of diamonds. Barbara is a huge favorite in this spot. Oh boy, and how! Then this happened. - Now flop comes... Six, three, queen. - Queen. - Flopped a sixes and threes. - Oh my god. Barbara was knocked out and women have not returned to a final table at the World Series of Poker Main Event since even though there are so many amazing female players: Jennifer Harman, Liv Boeree, Kristen Bicknell, Loni Harwood, Kelly Minkin, Kathy Liebert. These women have made millions of dollars playing the game and were poised to break the glass ceiling and take home the coveted bracelet at the WSOP. As a woman and a poker player, I wanted to be a part of it all and as a filmmaker, I wanted to document it. I wanted to be there the first time a woman took the bracelet at the WSOP World Series of Poker Main Event. On my quest, I would meet the most extraordinary women in the game. - I am a professional poker player. I'm a cash grinder. - Yeah for a long time, I was just saying poker was a hobby. And I guess now, I'd be sort of considered a professional, yeah. - My name is Kelly Minkin. I'm a professional poker player. - You know, it's not something common like you're a doctor, you're an engineer. You're a poker player? Excuse me, are you a poker player? You know, it's like a little shocker. - And for us as women, it would be so amazing and for the sport in general, it would be so amazing for a woman to win or at least come deep, like at least deep in the final table because it'll just open up the game. There'll be more women in poker, which makes poker a bigger sport, which is good for everyone. - I'd like to see a woman win a bracelet and definitely see at least one woman at the final table of the Main Event this year. - I mean what a dream to be at, you know, the final table of the Main Event if we're thinking like that at the World Series Main Event. - I believe that in my lifetime, we will definitely see more women approach the Main Event final table and we've seen that already. Like a lot of women getting down to the final four, five, even two tables. And so I definitely think we're gonna see more women reaching very far, final tabling and hopefully eventually being a champion, a Main Event champion. - Ooh, my title would be poker enthusiast. I never had any regrets about being a poker player. It's provided a nice lifestyle for me, my family, my friends and it's provided so many wonderful adventures. I love poker, can't wait to play my next hand of poker. - It's very hard to say what I do or like explain a poker tournament. My number one reference is golf. It's so easy to understand in golf terms. Like okay, all these really good golfers come together. They create this big purse or prize pool and then they get paid out based on their performance. A lotta times, luck is a factor. Your ball can hit a rock on the side of the fairway. You know, your swing could be off by one little tiny thing, whatever. So luck does play a huge factor. But in the end and over the course of 100 tournaments, you're gonna see like, a lot of the better players be at the top a lot. On the competitive side of it, it's the same. Everything is dependent on your own self. You don't depend on anyone else. Yes, you can depend on your caddy, whatever. But like, at the end of the day, it's all in your own personal control. So similar to poker and the biggest thing is I don't think there's ever a ceiling for how good you can get. - Most people who are professional poker players grew up playing poker. I didn't, I never played a hand of poker until I was 21. But the first time I played, I knew it was my thing. I always say, "Everybody's good at something." I was good at poker from the beginning. Poker is a game that can be beat. And unlike roulette and craps and things like that, there's no professional craps players or roulette prayers 'cause it can't be beat in the long run. But poker, if you play better than your opponents and you make better decisions than they do, you can expect to win. - I'm a professional poker player. - I've been playing full-time for about 10 years now. I think women are getting better every single day. The game is getting tougher every day and the women competitors are just really, really strong. I think a woman has just as good of a chance as a man to reach that final table. - I believe than anyone can be a winning player with study. Like nowadays, there's just so much information out there. Back in the day before the Internet, and before even the first books, people didn't share the information as openly about how to beat the game. But now, there's just so much information. If you wanna become a winning player, it just takes hard work like anything else. - Before I started playing poker on a regular basis, I had no idea but there's a whole world built around the people that love the game. Today, poker has its own subculture with so many resources for education and entertainment. There are poker magazines, poker blogs on YouTube. There are poker cruises, poker podcasts. Lines of clothing just for poker players. Poker even has its own coffee. There are dozens of poker books and poker tournaments all over the world, many with their own TV shows. This is poker night in America. There's even an unofficial poker uniform and generally includes comfortable clothes, a backpack filled with things like energy drinks, water and nutrition bars and definitely Blue Shark sunglasses. I gave these to a good friend of mine as a gift and she was pretty excited. - What? Oh my gosh, I was just saying to you I was gonna start wearin' glasses maybe to up my game. I look like a poker star or what? - Oh yeah, that's right. - I got poker mojo. These are my new shades. There are poker tournaments that benefit charities. - Shuffle up and deal. Let's play some cards, y'all. Raise some money for Mickie's Miracles. Poker is the number one way, especially poker charity events, to raise money for charities. It used to be golf, right? But golf is hard. If you've never golfed, like how do you do that? With poker, just teach people. You got two cards and you like 'em, go all in. It's for a good cause. There's the Hendon Mob, where you can keep track of the trophies, titles, accomplishments and earnings of every poker player. There are online poker training sites that teach you how to be a better player using artificial intelligence. We're the world's number one poker training site. We have virtual computerized poker players that you play against. They teach you to be a better poker player while trying to beat you at the same time. - That's the beauty of poker: You can be as good as you wanna be, you know? Like could I go out and do brain surgery tomorrow? No, but I could get a start on bein' a good poker player just by picking up some books and talking to some friends and getting started. - The beautiful thing about poker and tournaments is you don't have to be anything. There's no requirement. I've seen people play that have had no hands. I've seen people play that are blind. I've seen people play that physically cannot move their body. They're paralyzed and they have a reader. I've seen 90 year olds play. I've seen 19 year olds play. I've seen every race play, every religion. Anybody can play a hand of poker. That makes the profession really cool. - This ecosystem is mainly made up of males. We know that 25% of our TV viewers are females. 25% of our Club WPT players are also women. So we know that there's a real interest from this demographic. It's unfortunate that the live scene tends to hover around 4%. But I really believe that over time, with support of the players and all players, men and women, I think that offline number will hopefully mirror their digital and online counterparts. - You walk in in there and there's all these guys and they look like sort of total degenerates; like rough and tough and they're wearing their you know, hats and everything and you sort of feel like ooh, this is no place for a lady. But once you sit down, then you're really happy. You're like oh, I know where I am. - My mom's been great. She's always been supportive of me. When I first told her I was playing poker, she was a little bit nervous for me. She goes, "Isn't that addicting?" You know, she was nervous. But she always told me, "Do what you love. "The money will follow". This was my idea of a dream life: making a living playing poker. But poker was the last thing I ever thought I'd fall in love with. I didn't even discover the game until pretty late in life. I learned to play poker on my cellphone using the Zynga app. I picked a cartoon female avatar and a name to represent me as a player and took my free virtual poker chips to the table of live online competitors. We were each dealt two cards. I had a limited understanding of poker at this point. At first, I thought if I was dealt an ace or a king, I had a winning hand. That proved to be over-optimistic. We're sorry, please try again later. - I actually learned cards from like, playing with my family. Like my grandma would play Gin with us and like my mom and dad would play cards. - I learned how to play poker when I was probably about 12 years old, 12 or 13, from a family friend. And he taught us to play cards one day and he taught us Paul's game. It was great, we learned Paul's game. Well you know, fast-forward about 10 or 12 years, I realized that Paul's game was seven card stud and so we would sit in his basement and play poker. He'd have the penny jar and we would play and then we'd put all the pennies back. Nobody kept anything or put anything up. - My mom and dad would have little poker games at home. I always loved it. In fact, I even went out and bought a poker book when I was a kid and studied the poker book. And after I read the book, I kept my results of the home games in the inside cover of the poker book. You know, I was like, okay, I won $2 yesterday; so even then, I took it seriously actually. The game of Texas Hold 'Em poker is so simple, you can learn it literally in a few minutes. Each player is dealt two cards for their eyes only. The dealer spreads five cards: Three at once, called the flop, then another, called the turn card, and then a final card called the river. Players bet, check or fold between each round of cards. In the end, the player with the best five card hand wins the pot. - Let's put 'em in order. Maybe make it easier for you guys. So four of clubs, six of spades, eight of spades. All right, mommy's dealin'. It's your turn. You can bet or you can check. Bet means you wanna make people pay money 'cause you think you match up. Maybe you have a pair. Maybe you got two pair. Maybe you got a straight or you ain't got nothin', so you're just gonna check. Or maybe you want us to think you got nothin' so you're gonna check. You can say, "I check." So you bet or check? - Check. - Check. - Good job. - Check. - Check. Check! - Check, check all around. - We all check. Free card. - Whoo hoo! Yeah. - A 10 of diamonds! So now, daddy-- - Back to you, daddy. So maybe daddy, if you're going for spades, that's good. Maybe somebody's got a straight. I don't know. Azalea, same deal: check or bet? - Check. Okay this is called the river. The river. Who gets lucky on the river? Me, me, me. - Me me me. - A king. Wow. - Okay. - Oh yeah. - So now it's on you. - Oh yeah! - Do you wanna bet or check? - Check. Check, check. Check. Okay, go ahead and show what you got. Flip 'em over. You got a part of jacks. - Pocket jacks. - Beautiful. So here is a pair of eights. Does the pair of eights beat a pair of jacks? - No. - No, so you lost. So how 'bout daddy? Does daddy beat a pair of jacks? Nope. Mommy's turn. I ain't got nothin'. Which means who won? Last girl standin'. Take your money. - Well when I was in college, my brother lived in LA at the time and I was in town to visit him. And he had taken me to the Bicycle Casino 'cause he played poker. And so he had given me like $200 and I went and played like one/two limit or something. And it was just so fun to be able to compete with other people you don't know and like be in that atmosphere. He is the best player. - I am the best player at the table. There's not even a question. - Shuffle up and deal. - So I really enjoyed it and then I kinda got hooked on it. I won a little bit of money and then I won a little bit more and then I started going on my own and then here I am now. Some men have very firm ideas about where women fit into poker. Good job. But these women shatter those stereotypes. - I wanted to take a year off between some studies before I you know, did a masters or a PhD to just like figure out about the world a little bit. And during this time off, I started applying for TV game shows and one of the shows turned out to be a reality show that took five beginners and taught them how to play poker. And so my first time ever on TV or playing poker was on this show. Real Baptism of Fire, but I completely fell in love with the game like head-over-heels. I was just like wow, there's so many different skillsets that it requires and it's a game where men and women can actually play against each other on equal footing. And yet, there's so few of us girls. They underestimate us and so I can beat the boys. I call. Let's see the river card. - The river. - River. It's a blank. Liv Boeree has done it! Jakob Carlsson's the runner-up. Liv Boeree is the champion of EPT Sanremo. - Really really well played. 1.25 million euros. - It ticked every single box for me. Liv Boeree is one of the most respected women in poker. A quick visit to her website will show you so many impressive things that she's already accomplished. - I'm Liv Boeree and my educational background is in astrophysics and I've been absolutely fascinated with space ever since I was a little girl. Even though she first learned to play the game when she was a young adult, she managed to make millions. Jennifer Harman, who was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2015, got a bit of an earlier start. - I had a great childhood. I had a great mother. She loved to play games, so we were constantly playing games. My mom taught me how to play poker when I was eight years old. She would deal to me and my cousins and my sister and teach us how to play the game right, but I never thought that poker would be my lifelong career. I just loved playing poker. I loved playing games. I loved learning the game. I loved seeing the people. I love sound of the chips. I love the riffle of the cards. Just everything about it. You know, the touch of the felt and it just kinda kept me there until you know, I was gonna figure things out. - Yeah, I found poker when I was 18 years old. Some friends said, "Do you wanna play poker?" I said, "I have no idea how to play." They taught me the game. I fell in love. I played until noon the next day, the whole night. And I just couldn't get enough and then I kept trying to find like where the local games were that I could play and play in any game that I could find. - I came to Hollywood and I was dating an actor and he used to have his Monday night poker game. And I'm very competitive and that was the one game I didn't know how to play. So once, I was on a little getaway with him and a couple other of our friends and we asked him to teach us how to play poker. And then once I learned how to play, I said, "I wanna come to your Monday night games." And he let me come like once or twice and then I wasn't allowed to come anymore because it was his guy game, like poker was for guys. They wanna do guy things and smoke cigarettes and talk about chicks. - The first time I ever went and played a proper live tournament, I was the only woman in the whole thing and everyone turned and stared at me. - How you doin', little lady? - You know, there I was 21 wearing tiger-print pants. Fortunately I was certainly back then a huge extrovert and kinda liked attention, so it fit my personality type. I was like, oh cool. All right, I can handle this. - You definitely do get like an added attention. You know, you're not just like one of the boys. You're the girl in the boys' you know, league or whatever it might be. - I know people see me on TV and I wear the low-cut dress and the false eyelashes and everything. But that's because like television is different like on TV, I'm putting on a show. Just from way back whenever I would go on talk shows or whatever, I would always try to dress in an interesting way. Like I'd dress like I was going to a party because I thought I wanted to create a fun, exciting visual for the people at home. But when I'm playing in regular poker tournaments, I try to dress as much to fit in. Like I'll wear oversized t-shirts and a hat, you know, down low? I try to dress more like a guy because I do not want to attract that sort of unwanted attention to myself. - I remember the first time playing. My parents actually drove me across state lines 'cause in the province beside us, you're allowed to gamble at 18. And so they drove me there. It had this casino, the poker room had all glass, so they sat behind the glass and watched me. And I sat down and I was maybe the only female in the room. I'm not positive, but for sure the only female at the table and I was so intimidated. The first time I ever played poker in a real poker room, I have to admit, I was a little surprised. I was literally the only woman in the room competing in the tournament and it didn't take me long to see that guys definitely seem to play a little bit differently towards me because I was a woman. But I had studied hard and I knew that there was a right way to play. I could possibly become a great player. Unfortunately, some hands you just don't forget and they change everything. I was in a tournament in Southern California with about 60 other players. I'd folded crap hands all night long and my starting stack was evaporating right before my eyes. And then suddenly, playable cards. Everybody at the table limped in, placing the minimum bet needed to play their cards. I knew enough about poker to know that even with pocket aces if everybody's playing in the hand, your chances of taking the pot are diminished. I needed to narrow this field down to just a couple of players. I raised big: 10 times the big blind, 10 times minimum bet. The player on my left called, but the rest started to topple over like dominoes. The guy on my right thought about it for a bit, then decided to call. Great, much better. We're ready to see the first three cards. This was a great flop for me. My queens were still top pair and both players checked to me. I decided to bet big again. First player folded, but the player on my right just stared at me and then-- - All in. His bet made no sense. Unless he overestimated the value of his hand, I still had top pair. With my low stack, I had no choice. Call. At odds of 1,100 to one, roughly your chances of being caught in a house fire, he had flopped a full house. And when I asked him, "Why in the world "would you have called my huge raise "with such a horrible hand?" He said. - It was ego. I'll never forget that hand. It made me realize that because of ego or pride or maybe because they wanted to be alpha, it was gonna be very difficult to play regular poker against men. I had to be creative. - In general, I'd say with poker you always wanna do what people don't think you're gonna do or you always wanna do the opposite of what they're doing. I had to find a way to beat these guys at their own game. I had to think completely out-of-the-box and do something unexpected. I don't think that guy would've called my huge raise if I was a man. I felt like I had a target on my back. - Playin' with men in the old days was really kind of a pain in the ass. I mean you just weren't welcome and a lot of 'em resented that you were coming into their space and invading their pokerdom of manhood. It was I guess their man cave and they didn't want women to be in it and they made it quite clear. - And you just kinda get the like, "What is she doing here?" Or you know like, "Does she know how to play or whatever?" And, "Who gave you money?" "Who are you bleeping?" You know, to be in this tournament. Those exact words before and I just laugh because A: Why do you care? Like if you think I'm such a bad player, like why do you care where the money came from, you know? - Boys don't like being beat by girls, so it takes a strong you know, guy to be able to do that. So you definitely do have a little bit of tension. - I think you definitely have a situation that some men struggle to play against women or they don't like it if a lady takes their stack and they seem to take more offense to that in some way. And I think what that means is it's quite likely ladies will be played against differently by a lot of players who struggle with that situation. So I think if you are a lady who's playing a lot of poker, start to see that as something that you exploit. You exploit the insecurities of the man who doesn't want to lose his chips to you because he's gonna adjust his game because of that. And instead of feeling attacked, see that as a weakness that you can take advantage of. And I think that's one of the key things that women should be aware of if they're at the poker table is you know, this is a benefit. This isn't a cost. That's Elliot Roe. He's one of the most successful mind coaches in poker. He personally works with some of the best players in the world. His techniques help great players become legendary. Elliot retools the mind using hypnosis, meditation and other guidance techniques to help people overcome their hidden weaknesses. - Usually someone will be aware that there's something holding them back in some way. So nearly everyone I'm working with is probably sort of top 100 in the world looking to break top 10 or top 10 in the world looking to become number one. So they're not people who are really struggling, but they're aware that there's some fine tuning they can do, something going on in their mindset that's not abling them to be in a flow state the whole time. - Maybe you're playing at a poker table and someone's really getting under your skin and you're tryin' to figure out why is that, you know? And I think that this isn't my experience, but I've heard this a lot that people who were bullied as a kid, when they get to a poker table and they start to experience like, "Is this person bullying me?" Then all of a sudden it's hitting buttons. And you know, that's a common theme that I've heard that happens. For me, well I'm a perfectionist. So if I play a hand badly, I will hate myself for days. You know, it is April now. And there's a hand I played in September that I still go to bed and wake up thinking about and think why did I do that? - So what my work is is helping them to understand what might be holding them back, the subconscious issues in the background; perhaps things that have happened in childhood, to then work through those issues. So when it comes to performance, be it poker or the Olympics or whatever else it might be, they can actually perform to their potential. - I genuinely believe wholeheartedly that women have an advantage sitting at a table, significant advantage. If you take you know, you take five random guys, five random women. I teach them both how to play poker. First of all, women typically listen better. That might be sexist to say, but it's true. And I feel like are more studious and serious and also underestimated at the poker table, which is super important to capitalize on, right? So if people are adjusting to women playing differently, you can really take advantage of that. Okay, let's be real: If you were to talk to a professional poker player, they would tell you Daniel Negreanu is 100% right. But I was just learning to play poker and the idea of exploiting a man's biases along with playing my regular game, it just seemed like 3D chess to me. Until I was able to someday be lucky enough to sit down with somebody like Elliot Roe to overcome my insecurities, I was gonna need to be creative and unconventional to keep myself in the game. We are going to be transforming you into a man. Starting poker kind of late in life, I didn't really think I had time to ever become as amazing a player as someone like Jennifer Harman or Liv Boeree. But at least in the very moment I was at right now, I could level the playing field. - And this is a full-human hair, hand-ventilated beard, so it's gonna look the most realistic. Once that's glued on, I think that one actually will be really good. - Do you like that one? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do that one. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Perfect. - Do you think we should do a mustache? - Yeah, for sure. - Okay, okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Of course. - Well there's definitely a different dynamic if you're playing at a table all women or you're playing at a table all men. If you're playing at a table with two women and all men, it's a different dynamic. The more estrogen at the table, the more the dynamic shifts a little bit. - Okay, here we go. Goodbye, Sia. - Goodbye. - Hello Sam. - Can't say for sure, but I think that there's probably some men out there that really don't wanna lose to a woman and that would really upset them if they felt that a woman had got the better of them at the poker table. They feel like it's a man's game in that they get kinda offended that women are playin' their game and especially if they're better than them. Yup, that's me. Before I got the idea of dressing as a guy, I wanted to see what it was like to play poker as a cute girl called Sia. Well as cute as I could muster up. - You're so pretty. Take a picture. - Thank you. - Just come here. I'm tryin' to flirt, baby. I'm tryin' to flirt, baby. And it turned out guys do treat you pretty nicely when you take the time to dress up. That was something I could use to my advantage too. - I've seen women get edges many times and it's almost unfair what edges they can get if they do wanna pursue them, such as bein'... I mean the easiest one is be friendly with everybody and they're less likely to bluff you; they're more likely to soft-play you as a woman. - What I have noticed is guys do tend to soft-play me a little bit. Like I cannot tell you so many times when a guy has said you know, "Sweetheart, don't bet anymore. "I've got you beat." And I'm not asking for that. - I don't wanna knock out the woman at the table. You know, they're nice to look at. They're friendly. I've heard numerous times you know, the one woman at the table loses, old guy says, "Why'd you knock her out? "She's pretty." Ooh, I took you from this table. I'm wrong. But I didn't wanna be pretty; I wanted to play poker just like one of the guys. - Full transformation. You're about to erase every feature I have. Is he working tomorrow? Thursday. - So what time is your tournament? - Four. - I've actually thought about going in disguise, being dressed as a man to see how they play me differently than as a woman. They do. You know, even if you play online and you have a woman avatar as opposed to a man avatar, they play you different. It's a subconscious thing. - Just a bunch of degens'.I don't know what Katie pictures. She says "no talking to girls" but it is an infinite sausage fest. Should not be, but that is what poker is. - If it is just a random email sitting there, there's no way that they don't naturally just play differently against you. They'll just try to like you know, run you over, intimidate you and they usually don't think that you even have any idea what's going on. - I'm not PC. I'm not afraid to stereotype or whatever. But you play for a few hours, you'll pick up more info on your opponents. But as a slate, you gotta get a read. If you're in a dark alley and you see a guy with a hoodie and he's comin' towards you, you might be in trouble. If you see a woman with sparkly slippers and you know, a tiara, they're probably not gonna rob you. I don't know. Probably not politically correct, but it's true. So what gave you the idea to do this? - The whole reason I started dressing as a guy to play is because when I played online, I noticed that if I played as a woman, I would get like all these weird comments and guys would send like a little flower or they'd send me a donkey or they would just call me down with whatever. And I thought I'm so sick of this. I'm just gonna pretend I'm a man. So online, I started playing as a guy named John from San Diego, who's a big Padres fan. What I noticed right away is that I was taken more seriously and I thought wow, what a great social experiment would be if I actually disguised myself as a guy, right? - You guys see that? - Had a makeup artist disguise me as a guy and showed up at the table as a guy and what would that be like? And so that's where it all started. Just for the record: dressing up as a man was not my first idea. I started off realizing that men rarely respected my raises, so I started limping into the pot meaning I would not raise even I was holding a monster hand like pocket kings and that's where my nickname Black Widow came from. The male spider is much smaller than the female and is not considered to be dangerous. The male vibrates the web to attract the widow. Usually she does not attack the male as he tries to secure her with his own ineffective web. I decided I would start limping in or just pretending I was weak when I was really strong. Whether I was holding pocket aces or pocket queens, I was going to act weak and let the men come in and try to bully me around and then-- She encases her victims with silk and then kills with poison from her fangs. Turn over my monster hand and take all their chips. A lotta things came out of me dressing up as a man for the first time. I ended up writing a book about my experiences under the penname Sia Layta. And this documentary in some ways ended up coming right out of that first experience playing as a dude. Because even though I was winning more often when I disguised myself as a man, the guys are folding when I raise I would say four times as often as when I raise as a woman. I wanted to find out how to be good at poker as a woman. I wanted to learn more about how the best women in poker were winning as women. I started my journey by reading up on some of the women in poker history. Although a rare sight in poker rooms, women were not new to the game. Poker had its share of professional female players. Eleanor Dumont, Maria Gertrudis Barcelo and Lottie Deno used their looks and charm to bring male players to the table and then send them home empty-handed. One of the most famous female poker players of the Old West was Alice Ivers, better known as Poker Alice. She was an attractive woman in her younger days. And in a movie based on her life, she was portrayed by the beautiful actress Elizabeth Taylor. Born in 1851 to an upper-class British family, she attended boarding school and was well-educated. As a young woman, she married a mining engineer and followed him west to Colorado. She learned to play poker with her husband at the local gambling hall. She liked to dress in fine clothes but also smoke cigars, drink whiskey, cursed when she lost a hand and carried a gun. The Old West was a rough-and-tumble time. Bets were taken seriously and cheaters, if exposed, might even pay with their lives. In poker when a player declares they have the nuts, it means they have an unbeatable poker hand, the best possible hand given the five cards on the table. According to many poker experts, the term the nuts originated in the Old West. When a player was out of money but believed he had the best hand, he might bet his horse and wagon. He would then be required to remove the nuts from his wagon wheels and place them in the pot so that he could not flee if he lost the bet. It's assumed that he would never make such a bet unless he was sure to win. Poker Alice and her husband fit right into the culture of the Old West. Unfortunately, Alice was widowed at a young age when her husband was killed in a mining accident. With few career options, she chose to support herself by dealing and playing poker. It has also been written that she disguised herself as a man to sell bootlegged whiskey on the side. She eventually owned her own gambling establishment called the Poker Palace in Fort Mead, South Dakota. Alice claimed she won $250,000 in poker during her lifetime, an amount equivalent to millions and millions of dollars today. The more I learned about poker, the more I fell in love with the game and I decided it was time I went to my first World Series of Poker event. Besides, I had a secret weapon. This is a version of me I call Sam. I go with the name Sam because it's very similar to my real name, so I can pass when I use my ID to register for tournaments as a man. Traveling in my motor home gave me the freedom to go from one casino to the next, practicing before I went to the big event. Heads: I dress as a man; tails: I dress as a woman. Don't forget to take off your nail polish. Raise, raise, raise. Call, call, call, call. Raise, raise. 500. All right, hopefully I don't get busted for videotapin' it. It's hard sometimes playin' a man because you gotta remember not to do things like a girl. Like when they brought me my Coke, you know, I'm grabbin' my straw like a girl. Another thing I did too: As we're walkin' up to the door to leave for our break, I paused and let the guy in front of me open the door for me, right? 'Cause that's what I'm used to. That was weird. I'm like, oh shit. Now don't apologize or you'll sound more like a girl. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck are you doing? You can't back out if that's what. - I know, it's like be brave. Just do it, just do it. - So for the Black Widow out there, you can show up dressed as a man. You can show up dressed as a woman. You can dress up as a fuckin' elephant. I don't give a fuck what you look like as long as you got these fuckin' nuts and you got that fuckin' cash. - You know what's so funny? I was playin' poker the other day and I was playing at the table and the dealer and players were talking about me. They're like, "There's this chick "and she dresses like a dude, and you know, "She played here once." "I heard she played here once," and all this stuff. What actually happened was once I was playing at Morongo as a guy and a cop came up behind me at the table and tapped me on the shoulder and I was like. He's like, "Excuse me, sir." And I was like, "Oh, great." "Can I see your ID?" And I was like, "Great." I was like great. I have this full beard on. I had to turn around at the table and we're in a tournament, everybody's looking. So I pull out my ID and of course it's female. And he's like, "Uh." I go, "Yeah, you know what? "I'm writing a book and I did this for investigating." He goes, "Exactly why are you dressing as a man?" And I said, "This is social experiment." And he gave me back my ID, he's like, "Okay, fine." And the reason they stopped me is because I was actually videotaping a little video blog in their main room and so they were wondering what are you videotaping? So it turned out it wasn't because my costume was bad, it was just because. That was weird. Anyway, so as I'm sitting at Morongo like six months later, they're still talking about that. I was winning a lot more playing as a man, so I had big plans. I wanted to play the World Series of Poker as a guy. I even had a fantasy if I made it to the final table, it would be so amazing to pull off my beard, pull off my jacket and show underneath I was actually a woman. Okay, headed out of Home Springs and to Las Vegas. And then I heard this on a podcast. A woman selling a book wants to play in one or more World Series events dressed as a man. You have been quoted as saying that the World Series of Poker is opposed to this and will stop it if it can. What I tried to explain to her and her people is she's gonna lose her $10,000 buy-in. - The World Series of Poker let me know that if I showed up playing as a guy, they would kick me out and I would lose $10,000. I didn't go to the WSOP in order to do publicity for my book. I did not plan to dress as a man and play the World Series of Poker Main Event as a man to promote my book. I wrote the book so that I could take a tax write-off for all my tournament losses. Unfortunately, once they threaten me with $10,000 penalty and throwing me outta the tournament, I couldn't afford to take the chance. I talked to a couple lawyers and they told me I really didn't have a case. But I am a filmmaker and that didn't stop me from going back to the World Series of Poker the following year to do a documentary about the best women in poker. I made my way to Las Vegas and I rented a room at the Rio for 30 nights to span most of the time that the World Series of Poker events would be going on. I got a huge room with lots of extra beds and we called it the Poker Palace and set it up so that women had a place to relax and take a break from the poker room downstairs. A lotta people don't realize this, but poker tournaments can be extremely exhausting. Not only do you have to sit for maybe 12 or 14 hours per day; but as the tournament goes on, you return day after day to do the same thing. And while you're sitting there, you have to focus so intently. - The poker lifestyle can be a bit harmful for your health because we sit there hour after hour without moving and you know, eating crap because it's easier to get at the poker table than a good meal. - Sometimes I try to compare it to for people that don't understand, to what it's like to be on an airplane going to New York City and back. Anybody who's ever gone long distance on an airplane sitting in one seat in one position for all those hours, it is physically exhausting. - You know, to like be on the top of poker, you have to be willing to just like be so mono-focused. - What are the other players doing? How is their body language? What kind of cards are they holding? - Or maybe you think that I have this. But I know that you think that, so I think I'm going to do this and you know, make you think this. - And casinos are notoriously cold, which is one of the reasons I wear fingerless gloves when I'm sitting at the table. Having my hands up there in temperatures that are below average gets extremely uncomfortable after a long period of time. So it is a real endurance race to get to the finish line of a poker tournament. And so I wanted the Poker Palace to be a place where women could rejuvenate. Women could come up to visit, have a cup of coffee, grab a protein bar, get free physical therapy, discuss hands and even spend the night. It was just gonna be a place to support women in poker. - Come with me now. Two seats are empty on. The World Series of Poker was an exciting environment, but I had no idea how exciting it was about to get. This is California, it ain't over yet. I didn't feel it the last couple days. It was a magnitude 7.1 earthquake felt as far away as Los Angeles. - On the air, we're experiencing very strong shaking. - Wow. - I think we need to get under the desk. - All right, we're gonna go to break. - We'll be right back. - We'll be right back after this. - We'll be right back. - Wow. And then this happened. I don't know what happened. He shoves all in blind. He turns around. He's got a Pittsburgh Pirates shirt on. Now he decides I'm gonna drop my pants. He pulls his pants down. That's right, his actual dick is out in the middle of the Pavilion Room at the World Series of Poker on day one. - I always say a documentary will tell you what the movie's about. You do not tell the documentary what it's about. So it started out as a movie about women in poker. There's a lot more drama than I expected. Okay, so you're saying that you won't do the documentary if is in it? But she's a big part of poker. I'm pretty sure she has to be in it. - Whenever there's women involved, there's drama, isn't there? You know, first I have who basically said yes that she would do an interview with me. Next thing you know, she's too busy. She's too busy, she's too busy. Then it was, "Well are you offering compensation?" I was like, "No." 'Cause we're supposed to be a documentary. "You have 24 hours to take her off your website." Well done. Was gonna do this really nice package about and how wonderful she is and now here. Now here look where we are. Good job. She invited the whole cast to a party. 15 minutes before the party calls me and says, "They're disinvited." That was like 15 minutes before the party started. So yeah, she said she would do an interview, so I was excited. Yay, I wrote that too. Didn't say she was producing it, anything like that. So she ends up backing out. And believe me, that wasn't an easy back out. That was a no-lube, I-have-the-longest-dick-in-the-world back out. And now here I am shooting a video of myself because I don't have a fucking movie. I do not wanna tape this, but what am I gonna do? I don't have a story. Hey, sweetheart. And then I received a letter. Come on, really? Seriously? I'm tryin' to make a movie about women in poker. I'm tryin' to help women. "Don't use our logo and blah blah." "We'll take your money away, blah blah." I was so down and then I remembered something that Daniel Negreanu used to say in his video vlogs. Well actually Sylvester Stallone originally said it and then Daniel Negreanu said it. I think I needed to channel my inner Daniel Negreanu channeling his inner Rocky. - You just gotta take the beat to keep on comin'. It's not how hard you hit, it's how hard-- - You get hit and keep movin' forward, how much you can take and keep movin' forward. That's how winnin' is done. - In poker, you just gotta roll with the punches. You gotta be one of the guys and especially if you're playing in a home game. If you're there and you're like, "Oh, my delicate ears. "Oh, don't talk about you know, this or that," you're not gonna get invited back. And I feel like I've succeeded when I show up and I'm one of the guys. And you know, in the home game situation, there's always like a lot of massage girls and they're wearing like lucite high heels and hot pants and you know? You can't come and say, "This is disgusting. "Oh, how could they have these kinda girls?" You know, you just have to be like this is the way that it is. These are things that make these guys happy where they wanna come and put $100,000 on the table. There's another place that women are always welcome in poker: strip poker. - Strip poker? How do you play that? - Just regular poker. Only instead of the bets, the loser has to take off some garment. It's lots of fun. And Hollywood is more than happy to capitalize on this. - Well c'mon, let's go. Strip poker is fair game even for advertising. - I got nothing. - What's goin' on? Get back to bed. Feel young again. Centrum Silver. - Okay Loni, I'm curious. What were you like as a kid? - I was definitely a troublemaker as a kid. I stirred the pot quite a bit. I definitely got myself in trouble. I was the class clown always making jokes. I had a great childhood. Me and my brother, we grew up as best friends and I was definitely a tomboy. I played so many different sports. I just chased my brother around. He was three years older than me and I felt like I had to do everything that he did. We would play football outside. We played basketball. I played soccer, swimming. I even did dance. I mean, I really just tried to do everything. Me and my brother, we were in karate. We did a lotta sports. My mom made sure that I had a great childhood. Loni Harwood is definitely one of my favorite poker players. She's amazingly skilled and has countless awards and one of the best poker faces I have ever seen. That is not a photograph. That is a real-time video of Loni Harwood staring down the competition. She was also one of the most gentle, generous and fun-loving women I had the opportunity to meet while making this movie. Do you have a boyfriend? Yeah. I do have a boyfriend. Oh really? Tell me about him. What's his name? You gotta since you told me you did. - All right, his name is Phillip Hui. And is he inspiring to you? - He is inspiring to me. He's on day three of the 50k right now, so hopefully he wins that one. Loni Harwood lives, breathes and loves poker. - My dad was actually a poker player himself. He played online before Black Friday. Black Friday was obviously when the government shut down poker. My dad was pretty successful on Poker Stars. I would just watch him play online all the time and you know, I would see him win with a horrible hand. And I'm like, "Wow, you could win with nothing," like people just fold. - Whoever comes up to me and says that you know poker is gambling, I tell them, "Have you ever played poker yourself?" So they always say no, they never tried it themselves. They've never ever competed in a competition before. This is a mind sport and not just gambling. That's the great thing about poker: Unlike slot machines or roulette, you can actually win a huge amount of money without holding the winning hand at all. But it takes time to learn how to do it just right and it takes a lot of courage. - I sometimes think poker is like a big game of Chicken and it's sort of like it's a dick measuring contest. And whoever has the big dick wins because you know as well as I do a lotta times nobody has anything in poker. - So I just put all of my energy and focus studying. You know, doing everything I can to learn in talking with people. Getting on shows like "Live at the Bike!" for you know, exposure and being able to watch how I play. A poker player can win all the money in the pot by simply convincing others at the table that she's holding the winning cards. That's famously called a bluff. Bluffing is a huge part of poker. Here's a classic example of a successful bluff. At all times in this hand, Jean in the red dress with pocket nines is holding the winning cards. But watch what Wino does in order to win the pot. All the cards that come out so far are pretty small, so Jean's probably pretty sure she has top pair. Of course Wino has two over cards. So if she hits a queen or a jack, she's gonna be doing better than Jean. She also has a flush draw with her spades. Jean bets again with top pair, hoping that Wino gets off of whatever she's chasing. Wino thinks carefully and then continues to call. At this point, Jean has gotta be thinking why are you still calling my bets? Do you have sixes? Do you have an ace? She checks. Sort of a sign of surrender. Her hand's not that great and at this point, Wino has a choice. She can turn her cards over and lose or make a big bet pretending she has something amazing. Very large bet. Jean in the tank. That means she's thinking really hard about this hand. 450 and about 700. And she's gotta be wondering why would Wino stick around? She has got to have something good. Maybe a straight, maybe an ace. Wino's pretty much only repping an ace here. Wow, Jean is gonna lay it down I think. But the truth is Wino has nothing. Nope, not yet. Wino could have like the ace high spade draw too and just hit an ace. She missed hitting any of her high cards and she missed her flush draw. And Jean, is left to her own imagination wondering. Jean's, I think she hears that eight seven got counterfeit. How much is she about to lose? Don't know if she follows Wino-- Oh my god, Wino gets the bluff through. Look at that little smile. Oh Jean's like oh my god, but is friendly. - I'm a self-proclaimed wino. I live in Temecula and there's a ton of wineries there, so I really like wine. I never proclaimed to be like the best poker player. I just wanna have a good time and make people laugh. And I really do enjoy the game. I don't know why but guys happen to like to bluff girls. They think they can get away with it. I learned that really quickly and that's honestly why I do pretty well. - I think men makes this assumption about women. They feel like they, number one, they don't have the balls or they're not capable of constructing very complicated bluffs like, you know, doing the float, the check raise, the three barrel all in, that sort of thing. They feel like, you know, oh women really are the gentler sex and if they're doing that sort of thing, they probably have it. - So I've taken on this like kind of like trappy style of play only because if I show weakness, I feel like I don't even wanna give this information away because I don't them to get smarter. It's like they're a different species. They're gonna get smarter, they're gonna outgrow me. - When I graduated high school, I told my parents like, "I don't wanna go to college. "I just wanna do poker." And they were like, "No, you're crazy. "Like, you have to go to college." I went to college to graduate so that my dad would start me off in poker. He says if I graduate, he'll start off my bankroll; so that was what I did. I went to college and then once I graduated, two weeks later, I packed up my car and drove out to Florida to live with my dad and pursue my dream. - I thought my sweatshirt came, but I guess maybe it didn't. Cool. - It's cute. - What I love most about what poker's taught me over the years is how to take risks in life and love. So it's taught me a lot over the years. - My dad builds race cars and he's a race car driver, so I grew up with kind of a weird life in the sense that my parents were working 'til midnight. Every weekend was spent at the race track which you know, I sometimes wonder if being in poker, which is such a male-dominated industry, is similar to me the fact that I grew up around the race track, which is very male-dominated, and I used to race go-karts myself. - One thing I noticed about these women is that as kids, they operated outside of gender boundaries. I believe that that's because so many of them had parents that encouraged them to follow their passions regardless of their gender. - I was always outside. I was always dirty, climbing trees, that kind of thing. And so yeah, I definitely grew up with a big love for nature and animals. And then as I got a bit older, my competitive streak started to emerge and I was just insanely competitive. Whenever there was like, awful, like exams, sports, running, you name it, I always wanted to be the best. Even if I wasn't, I still wanted to be that and I would like, strive my hardest to come out on top. - My dad had always been a minister and when I became a poker player in my 20s, it was a lot of explaining to do. - I was kind of a tomboy. I was into sports and very competitive from a young age. - When I was a kid, I was teacher's pet. You know, I excelled at school. If I got a B, I was absolutely devastated. - As I kid, I was actually always interested in playing cards. I was never interested in playing or doing like, what the usual kids do. - I mean I remember like they were like, "Don't you like the doll?" And I'd rip that doll's head off and run over it with my car and they were like, "Okay, she's into cars; that's fine." - I did the ballet and I did the horse riding and you know, I was the school monitor on the bus. - I was very competitive as a kid. I was always involved in sports and you know, whatever we did, it was who gets to the elevator first to push the button. It was all a competition. - I remember I used to be very competitive and I used to be the best in my neighborhood. The fastest runner and hit the home runs and everything. And then puberty happened and all of a sudden my home run would barely get me to second base. - Soccer I actually played on an all-boys team because they felt like I wasn't getting challenged on the women's team, so they put me on all-boys team. The parents of the boys weren't happy that a woman or a girl at the time was coming on to their team and taking spots away from their kids. And I remember the first time I played, they booed me. Like I personally, as a kid, I didn't really think anything of it. But my parents were so hurt by it. But then right away, I think I scored a goal 'cause I played center man and right away I scored a goal and apparently they all shut up. And then they're okay. Like winning was all that mattered in the end. - I was adopted when I was two, so I came over from Korea. The first two years of my life are a little bit of a mystery because my story was that I was actually like, abandoned at a train station. And then I was found and then I was you know, sent to an orphanage and then adopted; so those first two years are kind of like a mystery. I think that played a huge part on why I was so just I guess introverted and shy and a little bit intimidated by my surroundings. My dad used to always say I didn't even like really come out of my shell until like sixth grade. But then once I finally did in sixth grade, I guess I couldn't shut up. - My mom's name was Alisa. She was the greatest woman ever and she always told me to pursue my dreams in poker. She was there for me when I won my first bracelet. I always think about her because she would always tell me to fold jacks. So I laugh all the time when I see 'em and I lose with 'em 'cause I'm like she would have told me to fold them. But yeah, she was so proud of me and she was really an amazing woman. She did everything for us. She worked you know two, three jobs. She cooked dinner for us every night. She drove us everywhere. She made sure that me and my brother were her whole life. - There's no time in the world for poker better than the World Series. Like the World Series is when you make all your money. - It's a lot of stress. It's a lot of competition. It's a lot of testosterone. - I think everybody has a dream of like coming to Las Vegas, to the World Series of poker and having success. Welcome back to Las Vegas for continuing coverage of the World Series of Poker. Right now everyone chasing Gaelle Baumann, a woman on top of the Main Event. What is this, the 21st century? - The highs are super high. So if you do get to have that success, if you do get to be in that 10% that gets success this summer, you're just like, I mean, you're just walkin' like, you know, like untouchable. - We are outnumbered in the Main Event for sure, but there are incredibly good female poker players out there and even up-and-coming. Incredible players. And I feel that they have a really good shot of getting there too. - It requires being in people's face, being aggressive and not shying away from confrontation. And I know at least for me, I grew up thinking women are supposed to be demure, maybe a little bit shy, at least in relationships and in person. But luckily for me, competition, I always knew that you're supposed to crush the competition. Vanessa Selbst always finds ways to accumulate chips. Another woman? What is the world coming to? - See how fierce she is on the table, right? How awesome she is like looking into your soul and three bet and you called while she rakes those chips. - Vanessa's very successful because she's got a lot of testosterone. She amps up the aggressiveness. So obviously doing something right. I think it's best to err on the side of aggressiveness as opposed to erring on the side of caution. - All in. - Massive bet. - I call. Oh my god. - This is a very volatile game. It is. - All in, baby. We're all in again. Look how big this pot is. Whoa! He needs runner runner clubs. It's not comin'. - I think that women are a little bit more plugged into sort of this psychic energy at the table. Whereas men, I think if I'm gonna make a generalization about the difference between men. What men have is a lotta testosterone. So men love to go into battle. Like obviously poker is kind of like a war. - Guys just like to I don't know, it's something genetic. Because we're not allowed to get into fist fights with the people on the streets, so we have to you know, resort to chess and poker. - So the ideal mixture of a man and a woman is to have a lot of testosterone, but also be able to do that sort of delicate knowing what the other person has or knowing what's gonna tip 'em over the edge. - Oh my god. - She turns quads! Four aces for Kristen Bicknell. - There's just this feeling that you know that's something's shifting. That you know, women are having this success and it's not just some fluke. - As far as what it takes to be a great poker player, women absolutely have it. Loni Harwood with the call and he is beat and just mucks his cards. Loni Harwood is the 2015 national champion. Well Loni can go celebrate. - If you can play your best game and not have too much bad luck, you have a chance. - It's one of those viewer discretion is advised as a profession. It's something that's great as a hobby, great to even play with your kids and teach them math skills. But in terms of making a living out of it, you better be ready to devote your life and realize that even if you do, you still might not make it. This project has been an adventure. And like poker, it has been filled with unexpected turns, tricky situations and occasional good luck. I went into it following the most well-known, talented women I felt had the best chance for winning the WSOP Main Event. But as we've all learned poker is unpredictable. In the year that I was there, the only woman to win a bracelet in a co-ed World Series tournament turned out to be an accountant from Mint Hill, North Carolina: Susan Faber. - I'm here with the latest World Series of Poker bracelet winner Susan Faber who just took down the Salute to Warriors for over $100,000. Susan, congratulation. How do you feel? - I feel really excited and really happy that I was able to win a bracelet and happy that I'm a woman. Never won the bracelet. I would encourage any woman regardless of age to give it a try, see if they're any good at it. - I definitely encourage women to play poker these days. I think it can be a good living for them. I think the conditions are very favorable to women these days. - There's quite a few of us who are being consistent with our results. We're showing up, we're confident, we're ready to win. I tried playing poker as myself. I tried playing poker as a girly-girl. I even tried playing poker as a man. But one thing I found out having talked to all these professional poker players, the best women in the world, is that you really have to study. You have to dedicate yourself to the game and there's no shortcut. Women are strong. Women are rising to the top in so many ways today. We've seen more women than ever in Congress and leading in politics than ever before. Women are winning awards for the first time that typically go to men. They're uniting for change and speaking truth to power. Women are entering male-dominated competitions and they're excelling. Six left for Fallon Sherrock. Game, set! And Fallon Sherrock smashes the glass ceiling and wins at the World Darts Championship. Even the girls are doing their part. - If you agree, register to vote. Contact your local Congress people and give them a piece of your mind. They are superheroes. It should be two-nil and is. What a World Cup for Megan Rapinoe. While in the process of finishing this movie, I took a break to play poker with a few of my neighbors. I looked up at the TV and there was Kristen Bicknell at the final table of the $25,000 Poker Masters event. No woman had ever won this prestigious tournament until now. Kristen Bicknell is the first female player ever to win a Poker Masters title. With so many amazing poker tournaments ahead, the only question left is: who's next? One of the things that impressed me the most about the women I interviewed is that they were so much more than amazing poker players. They were also extraordinary women. Jennifer Harman, she's survived two kidney transplants. Her sister and her mother died of the same illness when she was young. She's a single mom of two very talented boys and has worked to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation. Kelly Minkin earned her bachelor of science degree in molecular and cellular biology and she's also a medical-malpractice defense attorney. She is currently part of a legal team that is working to bring justice to players who were cheated in the poker room. Loni Harwood has a finance degree. Her boyfriend and world-renowned poker player, Phillip Hui, did in fact win the $50,000 WSOP tournament for a prize of more than one million dollars. After celebrating, they got engaged to be married. Linda Johnson and Jan Fisher helped to create the original Tournament Directors Association, the TDA, which sets common rules for tournaments. They've been partners at card player cruises for more than 25 years and travel the world with poker players who wanna combine a vacation with their love of the game. Liv Boeree earned her first-class honors degree in physics and astrophysics at the University of Manchester. Her YouTube channel and Ted Talk videos explore the applications of scientific thinking to everyday life. She co-founded the charity, Raising for Effective Giving, that helps poker players find the right place to give back. Let's just take a soundcheck on spelling your name first and last. - Check one two, check one two. KMCD bringin' it to you live with a D-A-N-I-E-L N-E-G-R-E-A-N yo. Yeah, that's what's up.
