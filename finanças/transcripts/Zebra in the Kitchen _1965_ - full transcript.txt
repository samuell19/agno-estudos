I'm trying to convince Timmy here that he should give this pet to you, Mr. Hawksbill. It belongs here at the zoo, not at a family home. I won't give him up! Nobody can take him away from me! Whoa, whoa, hold it a minute, son. When you said that, you nearly scared me half to death. You don't need to be scared of Harry. I'm not scared of Harry. He's a nice little fella. We found him on a camp-out. What scares me, son, is that, well, not too long ago, a little guy said just what you said. Because what he said, everything started to happen. Just that one little remark, and before anybody could say or do anything, he nearly stood this whole city on their ear and nearly landed me in jail. I don't care. I don't want Harry in a zoo. Putting him in a zoo is like putting him in jail. Jail? Son, you just scared the other half of me to death. Will he be any trouble for the zoo? Trouble? Harry? Oh, no. He'll get so much love and affection that, well, he'll just never quit purring. I don't care! I still won't give him up! Whether you give him to US should be your decision, Tim. Right, Mr. Lionel? Yes, sir. That's right. Come here, Timmy. I want to tell you about this other little boy. Well, his name was Chris. Instead of a cuddly, little old Teddy bear like Harry here, his pet was a full grown-up mountain lion named sunshine. [Mr. Hawksbill] Now there's hardly anything more fierce or independent than a mountain lion. But there's always an exception to anything, and this here sunshine-- well, he was different. Why, even the deer knew that sunshine wouldn't bother them at all, except maybe to play with them. But there was an important reason for this. You see, Chris had showered sunshine with love and affection from the time he was just a teeny little cub. So, naturally, he was friendly as all get out. Why, he just loved dogs and people, especially his playmates prince and Chris. But there was one thing that sunshine loved just about more than anything else-- corn on the cob. Yes, sirree, that's how different he was. Well, what with sunshine and prince and all his other friends in the field and the forest around him, I reckon there wasn't a happier boy anywhere in the country than Chris. Until one day... [Cowbell ringing] Hi, uncle Travis, cousin Wilma. You're going already? Can't you stay? We never get to see you. You're going to see a lot of US from now on. Hey, you moving out here? No. The other way around. The other way around? I don't get it. Well, son, you see, we're, uh... We're moving away to the city. To the city! Away from here? [Mother] Yes, Chris. You remember we discussed it. But for how long? Chris, we're giving up the farm. But you can't! We can't go live in the city. I don't know anybody there except uncle t. And cousin Wilma. Might as well get things started inside, Annie. But, mom, I didn't know it was going to be this soon. Chris, your father feels badly enough already. Ever since he was hurt, the farm's been too much for him. So uncle t.'S found him a very good job in the city in a garden supply shop. He'll be making more in a week than we do here in a month. We should be grateful. But what about sunshine? I can't leave him. I can get a job right here with Mr. Richardson. I always help him do his chores. And leave US? Your dad and me? I guess not. [Father] Annie, tell me the things you want to take. I'm coming, Adam. Chris, we've got to go now. Bye, uncle t., cousin Wilma. Bye. But, Mr. Richardson, all I'm asking is that you keep sunshine for me for just a little while. Please, Mr. Richardson. Son, I once knew a fella up in Taylor county named three-finger Billy Dee. He lost two fingers to a mountain lion. That mountain lion didn't need those fingers half as much as Billy Dee, but he got too close to the mountain lion. But that's not sunshine. He's gentle. So is my wife, but even she gets ornery sometimes. You better let sunshine go his way, boy. But he doesn't know any other way, except being a pet. I've had him since he was born. He doesn't know how to hunt or kill or how to look after himself. He'll learn, boy. You'll be surprised how fast. He just doesn't know about running or hiding. He'd walk right up to the first hunter that came along, and he'll be shot! I know it! I wish I could help you, boy. Forget about sunshine, will you? Forget sunshine? How could I forget the very best friend I've got, forget somebody in my very own family, the one person who-- sunshine's not a person, boy. He is to me. One way or another, I'm not going to leave him behind to get killed or hurt or wander everywhere looking for me. Please. I'm sorry, son. I can't. I hope you'll understand. Yeah. Well, thanks. I understand. I guess. Good luck in the big city, boy. Come on, prince! [Dog barking] Here, dear--if you get hungry before we stop. All right, up we go. Now, you hang on. Don't move around too much, o.K.? Yes, dad. I will. Better take a last look, honey. [Chris] Sunshine, hop on! Let's go. [Chris] Stay down, sunshine! You all right, son? Stay here and watch things till I get uncle Travis, o.K.? Yes, dad. I thought you'd never get here. Do you think you could get a dish of water for prince? Just bring him in the house. It'll be all right. No. You go get it. We have to guard things. Aah! [Growls] It's just sunshine. He's a pet. He won't hurt you. See? You can pet him, too. What kind of an animal is he? He's a mountain lion. I've got to hide him. Hide him! Where? How? I don't know. Someplace where there's trees and bushes, someplace before they unload this doghouse. Come on! I think I know a place. Prince, you guard sunshine. [Purring] [Growling] Aah! Aah! No! Stop! Sunshine! Prince, I told you to guard sunshine! Show me where he went. [Dog barking] Those folks called the police department, the mayor, the fire department. Finally, somebody decided to call US over here at the zoo. Well, by then, a wonderful young fella that I want you to meet-- Dr. Hardwood-- he's the head of the zoo. He and his assistant miss moon and me-- we hightailed it over there. By that time, why, Chris had caught up with sunshine, and all those folks had caught up with Chris. There he was just hugging sunshine for dear life. Don't you worry, son. Dad, I just got to keep sunshine. I just got to. There isn't anything we can do with sunshine now, Chris. Then let me take him back. We just drove 800 miles. We can't start back now. It's up to the people at the zoo. We don't have a mountain lion at the zoo. We sure would like to have your friend sunshine. Sunshine might have to be put to sleep. You mean sunshine would have to die? No one's going to let sunshine die. Dr. Hartwood, you'd take very good care of him, wouldn't you? Nobody is allowed to work at our zoo unless they really love animals. That's our first rule. Isn't that right, Mr. Hawksbill? You're a cross-eyed lion if it ain't. My assistant miss moon-- there's nobody that knows more about feeding and medicine than she does. And we'd let you visit sunshine anytime. That's right. I'll give you special permission. Chris, dear. It's the very best place for him. They won't take him unless you agree. It's a decision you must make, Chris. It's your pet. You're the one who has to decide. Give me the net. The boy will put him in the truck for you. Thanks, dad. Come on, sunshine. Well, looks like it's all over, mommy. Is it, now? I wonder. Which way's the mountain lion? That way. If you don't see him, you'll hear him. [Mr. Hawksbill] The very first chance he got, Chris hurried over to the zoo. Well, that was when Chris got his first good look at our cramped cages and beat-up equipment and the whole old-fashioned zoo layout and everything, and of course, that started him feeling real bad all over again. After all, how could he know we were doing the best we could, the very best we could? [Elephant trumpeting] [Growling] Sunshine! [Growling] Sunshine! It's me--Chris. [Purring] Well, the next thing I knew, somebody shouted about a boy in danger-- too near the mountain lion-- and I lit out for that cage so fast, I nearly split the stitches in my britches. Now, don't you know better than that? I've seen a mountain lion like that one kill a cow with one swipe of his paw. You must never do a thing like that! Why, you could have been ki--oh. I'm terribly sorry, Christopher. This is Chris, the boy we said could visit sunshine. Yes, and I'd like to go in with him now! Chris, he's been upset. It's a little hard for him to get adjusted. I can see that. I'll quiet him down. Come on, sunshine. Stop it. You behave, sunshine. That's it. That's my pet. Now can I go in, please? Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea. He hasn't eaten for days. Do you think you could get him to eat? [Chris] Yes. O.k., let him in. Mr. Hawksbill, you better get that key snap fixed. Yes, ma'am. Come on. Stop pouting and eat, sunshine. I know how you feel, sunshine, but you got to eat. Well, right there before my eyes I could see it for myself-- sunshine eating for the first time in days. Now, don't you think that made me feel real good? That boy had a knack for handling animals. Around a zoo, that makes you somebody special. What's going on here? Visiting hours. [Purring] Oh. Hi, Chris. I'm glad to see you. Sunshine hasn't been eating very well. Did you give him corn on the cob, buttered? In hot weather, he likes ice-cold watermelon with lots of salt on it, oh, and peanut butter sandwiches. Peanut butter sandwiches? Yeah. But always cut off the crust. Always take off the crust. I'll remember that. Is now a good time to take him out, Dr. Hartwood? I'll tell you what, son-- why don't you come out here and we'll talk about it? Yes, sir. How about it, Dr. Hartwood? I'm sorry, son. We just can't do that. Why not? I have to take sunshine to see prince. I can't turn a mountain lion loose to go romping with you in the park, much less walking through the streets. He'd frighten people, Chris. Sunshine? I'll get my bike and bring a leash. You've got a bicycle? There's things a boy with a bicycle could do around here to earn money and be near sunshine. Right now I've got an errand worth, say, 25 cents? No. That wouldn't help prince or sunshine. I'm sorry, Chris. You'll just have to understand. He's got to be free. Anyway, part of the time. It's like recess at school. Son, this isn't a school. It's a zoo. It's not a zoo! It's a jail! It's a prison! [Moaning] No! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Chris! Chris, it's all right, darling. It's all right. It was just a bad dream. What was it, son? He's having a nightmare. Are you all right now? What were you dreaming about? I was locked in a cage-- sunshine's cage. He couldn't get-- I mean, I couldn't get out. Maybe we better talk about it in the morning. Sure, everything's always better in the morning. Do you want anything now? No, thanks. I'm o.K. Honest. Good night, sweetheart. You'll be all right. He never had nightmares before. What do you think it was? Giving up the farm? That and giving up sunshine. He's been a different boy since we put sunshine in the zoo. Yeah, I know. What are we going to do, Adam? Well, now that we know what the problem is and how deeply he feels, we'll just have to be there and see him through, that's all. [Prince barking] [Bicycle bell rings] [Mr. Hawksbill] Well, what with everything that had been happening to him and around him, the next time poor Chris headed for the zoo, he was just about ready to go off the deep end. Of course, none of US around the zoo had any reason to suspect how desperate Chris thought things were getting for himself and sunshine, and he sure wasn't going to let US find out. Are you all right, Chris? You haven't said a thing. I'm all right, but sunshine isn't. Chris, a zoo is a zoo. They have to keep their animals in cages. Even the regular pets know they can't just run around. Well, they have to be on a leash, like that pussycat over there. That pussycat doesn't look very happy to me. Look, he's got a collar on. [Chatters] Christopher Carlyle, why did you ever do a thing like that? Because I don't care what animal it is. If it can't be kept so it's happy, then nobody should be able to keep it. Chris, where are you going? [Chatters] [Growling] There you are. Look at you-- eating and eating and getting fat. First thing you know, you'll be bigger than me. Why don't you go fight a fire with your uncle smokey? Ha ha ha! Well, I'm going to go over here. Don't fall down, now. Stand up there by yourself. There. That's a good girl. [Elephant trumpeting] Don't worry, sunshine. You won't be here much longer. Just let Mr. Hawksbill be careless with his keys just once. Just once. Mr. Hawksbill. Well, I'll be a razor-billed ruddy duck. If it ain't the little man come back. I'm sorry, Mr. Hawksbill. I shouldn't have gotten mad at you. Oh, that's all right. Forget about it. You want to earn your quarter? Yes, sir. You just come along with US and help US with the feeding. I'll give you your quarter in advance. No, sir. Not until I've earned it. Well... That tiger's name is captain. That's because he broke out of his cage coming from India. Until they got him back in his cage, why, he practically ran the ship for three whole days. Ha ha ha! Now, no banging. No quick moves around the cats. You know that, don't you, son-- that animals have much more sensitive hearing than humans? Yes, sir. That's the way it is around sunshine, too. Any sudden banging or clattering, and... [Hissing] [Grr] You know, son, we ain't sore at you for saying this zoo ain't what it ought to be. We know it's pretty shabby, too. You do? Sure. Now, you take a first-class zoo, their buckets would be made out of plastic or rubber or something that wouldn't bang together. Gosh. Maybe you'd better keep that quarter you were going to pay me. Heh heh heh! All right, captain. Captain! Hey! Captain! There you are, captain. [Elephants trumpeting] What's the bike doing in there? This is Bruno. He's a circus bear. His trainer died, and he wouldn't do anything for anybody, so they gave him to US. I put his bicycle in there hoping that someday we'd have a bigger cage for him and he could start riding again. Thank you. Now, Bruno, don't get anxious, old fella. Don't get anxious, Bruno. There we go. Come on, boy. Come on. Hey... See here what I got. Bruno, look. Looky here. Ha ha ha! Oh! There you are! [Bruno belches] Got bad manners, hasn't he? Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Well, you see... Even wild animals are gentle when you treat them right. O.k. Here we go. Now... Well, this old lion's name is bronco. That's because nobody could handle him. Here you are, bronco. Now look at him-- just as gentle as an old tomcat. That's in spite of everybody teasing him all day long. I look over here at these cages sometime, and I wonder what side of the bars the animals are on. [Grr] Come on. [Grr] [Boys laughing] Down! You dig? Down! Look. I'm a tiger tamer. You want some gum, daddy-o? [Aroo] Down, cat! You dig? Down! [Grr] Ha ha ha! Hey, somebody's coming. Next time you'll know who's king of the row. Well, here you are, Chris-- payday! There's your quarter. If I could just work here all the time-- I mean if I just could-- you wouldn't even have to pay me. Any boy worth having is worth paying. And you know something, Chris? Everybody around here likes your work. You'll let me take sunshine out! No, no, no, no. I can't do that, but I'll tell you something. I'm going to make you my assistant. That will be... Real nice. I'll get you a cap just like mine, and it will say "junior head keeper." How about that? Mr. Hawksbill? Up at the compound. Injured elephant. Which one? Margie. Come on, Chris. You've got to get out. Can't I just stay a little bit longer by myself? Maybe you could leave me the key. Thanks, Isobel. [Mother] Chris? Chris? They told me I might find you here. I hope I'm not interrupting something. Hi, Mrs. Carlyle. Hello. Chris, we were worried about you. Wilma said you just-- I hope he hasn't been a problem. No problem at all. He's been a big help. [Mr. Hawksbill] He's been a big help. We got some big plans for him. What branch means is that Chris is welcome to work here at the zoo this summer if it's all right with you. Please, mom. He'll be in good hands. Very well. Thank you all for being so nice to Chris. He's no trouble to any of US. No trouble at all. Say good-bye to everyone, Chris. Bye. Bye, Margie! [Aroo] Take a look at that wolf. They were left on the desk, sir. Oh, thank you. Notice how weak his hindquarters are. He was injured by an older wolf in a fight. We didn't have the modern equipment to break it up. Every time I look at him, I get angry. Angry with whom? At myself first and then at you. You're members of the city council. You're the all-powerful parks and recreation commission. Every year you take your annual look around, and we tell you what we need. Then we don't see you again. And every year nothing happens. We have two other parks to visit today, and then we're due at lake Timmons. Let's get on with the inspection. Yes, let's. This is our only female llama. What happened to its leg, del? I'm glad you asked me that, councilman. Tell him, Mr. Hawksbill. We like to lost her last week. Chewed that leg up pretty bad. Got it caught in some of this fence. Fence that's been patched about four times. This fence should be replaced, not repaired. Come now, Dr. Hartwood. I'm not going to pull any punches. This pitiful excuse for a zoo is 50 years behind the times. Maybe you're a bit of an alarmist. Zoo doesn't look too bad to me. The acid test for any zoo is the birth rate among the animals and the death rate. Animals don't breed well in unhappy surroundings. Our birth rate here is practically nil. Our death rate is higher than any zoo this size in this part of the country. You tell US the birth rate is practically nil, and over there I saw a baby hippo. Sure, you did, but there's no telling how long it will stay alive. If you feel that strongly, why don't you just resign? Oh, no. That's what your indifference has caused every other curator to do, but you'll quit before I do. That we'll see. We should be on our way to the lion cages. Down, cat! Down! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Look at that crazy cat! [Aroo] He's a jitterbugger. Come on! [Grr] Come on! Ha ha ha! ♪ He's the daring young man on the flying trapeze ♪ Somebody's coming. Some big wheels. Yeah, a square one. Ha ha ha! Shall I run them out? No. You can't until they do something where we can see it. Even a lion will get lethargic if it doesn't have room to get proper exercise. Lethargic animals don't attract zoo visitors. Gentlemen, that's about it. Your car's down there. I hope you've gotten some food for thought. Mr. Hawksbill, you just got to let me take sunshine home. I don't want sunshine to die. I don't want any animal to die. Don't you worry about sunshine or any other animal around here. We won't let anything happen to them. But I heard Dr. Hartwood say... Wasn't that true? Well, yes, but that's statistics, ratio. You and I will take care of sunshine. I wish we could give you the money you need here, but the public has to care first. Until the public cares, my colleagues just aren't going to care. They know more than the public does. I wish they'd stop being politicians and start being public servants. Maybe you should try being more of a diplomat. I've been a diplomat until I discovered that people don't recognize there are diplomats and doormats. If I can't be one without being the other, I'm not going to be either. The person who refuses to resign can always be fired. Try it. I will. Next week you won't be here. One thing you can be sure of, I'll keep fighting. So will I. [Car starts] Ribs, there's your girlfriend now. That's not his girl. That's a hippo. Little one likes you, greenie. She's just about your speed. Yeah, she's cute, too. Hi. Come on. Looky there. She wants a smoke, too. Let's give her one. See what happens. Come on. Open up. Come on. Ha ha ha! I'm going to give her another one. Come on! Ha ha ha! Come on! Ha ha ha! [Hippo groaning] Ha ha ha! [Hippo groaning] Ha ha ha! We better get out of here. Come on. Let's go. [Aroo] Emergency. Dr. Hartwood and branch hawksbill report at once to the hippo area. It's the hippo. What you been up to? What did you do? I was just feeding the hippo some cigars. Take these punks to the zoo office. Come on, boys. You're getting out, too. Sunshine, stay here. Come on! You're free! Next! If the mother dies, her baby will die, too. Breathing's depressed. Give me 5 ccs of scopolamine. What she needs is a gallon of mineral oil. The animals are all out. They're everywhere. Every cage is empty. Isobel, you take over. Branch? Coming, Dr. Hartwood. I'm going to the police station. Get US some sleep guns. You'll have them. Who could have done this? Maybe it was those three punks that were so sassy. Whoever it was, they're going to see the inside of a jail cell. Ace, get the truck.

[Burp] [Music playing] [Burp] I'm Tarzan! [Tarzan yell] [Music playing] We've got to stay out of sight. When it gets dark, we'll head back to the farm. Nobody will think to look for US there. Where you going, son? To the country. [Whistle] [Woof woof] Chief, before you start shooting, you got to give me a chance to round these animals up. I can't endanger a single citizen for any animal, no matter how valuable. Turn this job over to me, and I'll put those heads right over there as trophies for your wall. My living room's full of them. Look, mister-- I didn't catch your name. This is Mr. Preston heston, one of our leading citizens. He goes to Africa on safari every year. He has offered to give US the complete and full benefit of his African hunting experience and together with his equipment. That includes my elephant gun, too. One shot right behind the ear, and pfft. Oh, great. Fortunately, these animals were fed just before they were turned loose. They're not going to be hungry before tonight. I could have most of them rounded up before then. I can't give you that long. The calls are coming in by the hundreds. Aah! [Woof woof woof] Stay down, sunshine. Stay down, prince. Zoo animals aren't going to bother anybody unless somebody bothers them, like this bloodthirsty cannibal here. My assistant can set up a special switchboard. We'll handle every call fast. I promise. All you have to do is give a message to the people to stay inside until morning. Chief, you owe these valuable animals and me this chance. I don't owe anybody anything except the right to walk the streets in safety. That's what I'm talking about, too. If you start hunting and killing these animals, nobody's going to be safe. My way, nobody will get hurt. I've got guns waiting outside, too-- sleep guns. We'll bring these animals down with harmless drugs without injury and without wounds. Don't you know there's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal? My way you won't have any. His way anything can happen. My way there won't be any wounded animals either. When I shoot, I kill. Chief, all I'm asking for is a little time. No. You're asking for more than that. You're asking me to stretch my neck from here to Alaska. Well, stretch it. Show what kind of a man you are. Nobody's going to chop it. I promise you. Very easy for you to say about my neck. Look, it's my neck, too. There are people waiting to hang me from the highest telephone pole if I goof by the ear lobes. Maybe you deserve it. Look, Dr. Hartwood, maybe we should give your methods a chance first. O.k. You've got six hours. All right, chief. You've deliberately hung yourself out on a limb. I'll be back in six hours or less to pick up the pieces. Good-bye, chief. Good-bye, young man. You won't regret it, chief. You don't mind if I make sure that I won't regret it, do you? Send in sergeant freebee. Sergeant freebee is the best shot in the department with a pistol or a rifle. Chief. From now on, wherever you go, I'm going to have him standing right behind you every minute, and any animal that your gun doesn't bring down, his will. [Grunting] Aah! [Television playing] You keep out of this! Oh, so you want to strike me, eh? Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [Hardy] Sit down. I want to talk to you. All right, but make it snappy. [Crunch] Ha ha ha ha ha! [Laughing] Wayne Thomas reporting with the news. Ladies and gentlemen, the city today was being swept by rumors of an animal invasion, rumors which we are happy to assure you are completely unfounded. Sources have assured US there is no reason at all for any concern of any kind. [Snarling] Attention! Attention! This is your police department. There are wild animals loose in the city. We have the situation completely under control. You have nothing to worry about. Attention! Attention! This is your police department. You are requested to remain indoors. There are wild animals loose in the city. Just remain indoors. I'm very sorry we couldn't have been of more help. You're welcome. Allan, this is miss Isobel moon. She's from the zoo staff. She's here to take over the switchboard. Hello. Do you mind if I sort of stand by? [Music playing] [Burp] ...a high fly ball to deep left field. It is...Gone! [People running and screaming] Adam, are you sure about this? The fellas at work heard on the radio that a whole zoo has been turned loose. Uncle Adam, the radio also said stay inside. I don't care what the radio said. Chris told you he was going to the zoo? If that's the way they run things, I don't want him around there. Come on. Let's go. Adam, what about your job? What about it, honey? Did they say it was all right to leave? Chris is more important than any job, honey. Excuse me, sir. You got it! You got it for me! Got you what? The pony! My pony! The one you said you might get for my birthday. Yes, but that was just-- you got it. You got it. What pony? The one in there. [When the saints go marching inplaying] [Growling] 748 bosswin drive. Oh, and Mr. Hawksbill, don't try to tempt little Bruno into the net with an ice-cream cone. He may not be very interested. Yes, bel. I remember. Hee hee hee! Mr. Hawksbill. Well, I'll be a cross-eyed lion if it ain't the carlyles. We came here to pick up Chris. Chris? You mean he ain't home? No. He's not here, either? No, no, no. He's not here. He--he-- well, he must be somewhere in-between. I'll tell you what you do-- you go out and look for him. If you don't find him, come check with me. By the way, keep the windows on your truck rolled up. Whew. Adam, with all those animals loose, I'm worried. Well, don't be, dear. When it comes to animals, Chris can take care of himself. [Telephone ringing] All right. I'm coming. [Coughing] Hello? Adam Carlyle. How are things in the big city? Uh, rich, have you seen Chris? Chris? No. No, why? Why? Is something wrong? Look, if you should see him, will you please call me? Oh, sure, Adam. Sure. Look, is he gone? No, no. Everything's all right. Thanks. No. Nothing. I think it's time we call the police. We had at the most just about six hours to get our animals back. Maybe it didn't seem impossible to Dr. Hartwood, but it sure seemed impossible to me. One thing we were hoping for that might help-- soon as some of them had wandered around for a while, they might just start coming home on their own just because they missed US. [Meow] [Snarling] Ah, he's up here someplace. I've got to get close enough to hit him in the flank, so don't get trigger-happy. You know what my orders are, doctor. Don't miss, because I won't. [Growling] Well, now I've seen it all. I told mommy you were out here swinging on my swing. She says what she always says-- "of course, dear." When I asked if you could come and live with US, she said the same thing-- "of course, dear." So I hope you like it in my room. It's the one right over there. [Trumpeting] Do elephants wear pajamas? Anyway, we have our own bathroom and a big bed. Elephant, don't go away. Come back, elephant. [Crying] [Yawns] [Music playing] Now from our news room, we continue with our special interview... Well, the ostrich is in, too, music and all. I'll bet if you left them alone, they'd all come home, such as it is. Well, in view of all that, councilman pew, where do you place the responsibility for all these animals being loose? One man and one man only is responsible-- the man in charge of the zoo, Dr. Del hartwood. If a man who is head of a zoo is supposed to know anything at all, it is first and above all how to keep his animals safely under his control. He wasn't even capable of that. Now, directly because of his incompetence and nobody else's, the citizens of this community cannot leave their homes with a feeling of safety. There is only one answer which I will accept as a member of the zoo commission to any more of this bungling on the part of Dr. Hartwood-- his immediate resignation and nothing less. That was councilman pew interviewed by your reporter earlier today. And now, another development-- acting on descriptions furnished by Dr. Del hartwood, police have just taken into custody three young men suspected of having freed the zoo animals. Each faces a long jail sentence if convicted. They are Henry houter of 729 ridgendon street... [Mr. Hawksbill] Sure enough, just like we sort of figured, many of the animals were coming back by themselves, especially the big eaters like the elephants. [Locks door] [Pop] [Train whistle blows] Ooh, la la! Ooh, la la! Mama. Yeah. He's just passing me now. It's as flat as can be. Yeah. Bruno on Collins street. Tell Dr. Hartwood. Mama. Mama. Mama. [Snarling] The tiger's in, too. Good. That means they're all rounded up except the mountain lion. I wonder where branch is. Maybe he's got a lead on the mountain lion. [Telephone rings] Hello? He what? And so the mystery of who released the zoo animals is solved by the confession of the person who did it-- head keeper branch hawksbill. Reporters interviewed him immediately after his voluntary surrender. Now to the police station. Aren't you Mr. Hawksbill? Is it dangerous to have animals running around like that? It's bad letting those cats out. Which is more dangerous-- the tiger or lion? You're the one who admits letting them out. Sure, I turned them animals out. I wanted to wake this town up to what was happening. Like what, sir? When I first come to work here, son, we had a zoo that anybody would be proud of. We just didn't keep up with the times. Now the whole city ought to be ashamed of itself. Mr. Hawksbill, how can you justify this action? Maybe after what happened today, somebody will give a little thought to the zoo and what's going on over there, and if I shook everybody up real good, then it was worth it. How about the penalties that you're going to face? Well, I don't worry too much about what's going to happen to an old cuss like me anymore. I was about ready to retire. And don't call them dumb animals. When it comes to dumb, you've got some city councilmen that can match them. Oh, no. Released, of course, were three young suspects arrested earlier. Now the sports and weather. On the local front, we have slight changes of weather. Branch couldn't have done that. He was with me at the hippo pen. Or just before. [Telephone rings] Yeah. Look, Isobel, I'm sorry, but-- Chris and sunshine? Grady street alley. Right. I'm on my way. Is freebee still in the truck? Afraid so. [Prince whimpering] [Dog barking] [Whinnying] Prince! Come on, boy! Come on, prince! Prince! Come on, boy! Come on, boy! Come on, prince. We got to get out of here. They went in that old warehouse. Those animals are going nuts. It'll take a couple bullets. You better call and tell the chief. Car 78 calling headquarters. Message for the chief. They don't get you back, sunshine, ever. Don't you worry. Are you Dr. Hartwood? Yeah. The chief sent a message to remind you that your six hours are up. He didn't agree to allow any animal to endanger others. He's also authorized sergeant freebee to proceed as necessary. Where's the boy? He walked inside the warehouse door with the mountain lion. You stay here. This time I'd better go first. You can wait one more minute, sergeant. Chris? [Growling] Chris, I want you to come out now, son. Go away and leave US alone! I'm sorry, Chris. I can't do that. [Dog barking] Prince and sunshine are very unhappy! I can hardly hold them. You might as well put that thing down. You can't use your rifle any more than I can use mine. The boy's in there with his arms around sunshine's neck. Did they find his parents yet? They're still out looking for them. Doctor, I've got my orders. Now, I'm going to get that mountain lion to charge. When he gets clear, he gets it. Wait a second. Hold it. I've got an idea. The boy isn't the only one that can handle a mountain lion. I'll be right back, o.K.? This time, I'm going all the way, and no matter what happens, you hold your fire. Doctor, that depends on what happens when you get near that cat. Dr. Hartwood, don't you come any closer. Now, Chris, we don't want to have to hurt sunshine. [Sunshine growling] Please go back. Sunshine might kill you. I don't think so, son. Animals like me. I like them. Anyway, I'm coming down now. Don't worry, Chris. In just about five seconds, I'm going to have sunshine purring. Don't, Dr. Hartwood! What are you doing to him? Well, don't worry. It's not chloroform or gas or drugs. It's a new secret weapon branch hawksbill invented. Here. Try some. Why, it's only whipped cream. That's right. Now, Chris, I want you to listen to me carefully and then think hard about something. Defendant, how do you plead? Guilty. You realize I can sentence you up to five years? Yes, sir, I do. Do you have an explanation for this utterly irresponsible action? Well, your honor, it's just like I said. If I shook this whole city up, I'll be a cross-eyed lion if it wasn't dang well worth it. Very well. This court imposes a fine of $2,000 and a sentence of at least-- uh, your honor, I've only got about 45 dollars and 37 cents in here. Your honor. I'm Dr. Hartwood, director of the zoo. I have evidence to prove this man is not guilty. But I amguilty. Now, this is a frame-up. I'm the one that did it, sir. B-B-But, your honor, this little boy is just like my own flesh and blood. Why, he's just saying that to protect me. Now, Chris, you don't have to do that. You go on home with your folks where you belong. This ain't a fitting place for you. I did it, Mr. Hawksbill. You know I did it. He don't know what he's saying. He's been drinking-- or, well... Permission is given to address the court. Let's get it on the record. Well, your honor, I'm glad the press is here. This may be the last thing I say as director of the zoo, but I intend to say it. This little boy loves animals. He believes, as he told me, if an animal can't be kept healthy and happy and contented, he shouldn't be kept at all in a park, in a zoo, or anyplace. That reason and that reason alone is why he turned these animals loose. Your honor, the crime isn't that somebody turned these animals loose and upset an entire city. The crime is that apparently this had to happen to make this city sit up and pay attention. When people are indifferent and apathetic about the zoo, they're indifferent and apathetic about their schools and hospitals. When people learn to be kind to animals, they're kind to other people. They're cruel and indifferent to other people. A zoo is kind of the first test of how we really are-- really civilized or animals ourselves-- and that's what this little boy and this wonderful old man may finally have brought home to this community. Your honor, I don't believe they deserve any punishment for what they did. I believe this community may come to realize that the only thing they deserve is thanks. If the district attorney sees fit so to move, the court will entertain a motion for dismissal. So moved, your honor. You are dismissed, sir, with my deepest respect. I'll be a cross-eyed lion. Now, as to this young man, you know you did wrong releasing those animals, don't you, son? Yes, sir. Your actions could have had very serious consequences. However, under the circumstances, I am going to make your punishment an exemplary one. I'm going to sentence you to forced labor-- two hours a day at the city zoo until school starts under the supervision of Mr. Branch hawksbill. Court adjourned. And all because of a boy who said, "I won't give him up, and nobody can take him from me." But what happened to Chris and sunshine? Come here. I'll show you. There you are. Now, that's the new zoo that the city council voted. Polar bears. Hey! No fence. That's right, son. You're catching on quick. Who do you think that is over there? Chris and sunshine! That's right. That's them. Pretty happy, wouldn't you say? Yeah, they sure are. Well, what do you say, Tim? You can have him. I know he'll be happy here. That-a boy. Well, Harry, come on. Welcome to the family.
