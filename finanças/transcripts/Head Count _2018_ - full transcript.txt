I'm comin', I'm comin'. - I'm comin'. - Slowpoke, jeez. Oh! - Thanks for the ride, bud. - Of course, man. Hey, uh, wish you were coming with. - Next year. - Yeah. Good luck with your bro. Ha! - See ya. - Bye, Evan! - Have a great break! - See ya! - Thank you! - Bye! Bye, guys! Fuck me. I found out your dad is definitely balding. Hey, it's Peyton. I don't answer my phone very often, because I am enjoying life, so leave me a message, and I'll probably call you back. Maybe. Hey, Peyton, it's your little brother. Um, I'm just calling to remind you that I'm coming today, because, you know, dorms are closed. I know you don't normally check your voicemail, but, um, just in case, it'll be good to see you. Uh, you don't have to call me back or anything. Anyway. Okay, um... see you soon, I guess. Bye. Peyton? Peyton? Peyton? Peyton, if you're in there watching porn again, I swear I'm leaving. You are of sound mind. Jesus, dude! Haah! You scared the shit out of me, man! - I'm here. - Ohh! Sorry, man. I... forgot when you were coming. Um, go ahead and set your stuff down wherever you want. - Way ahead of you. - Great! It's good to see you, man. You too, Peyton. So what do you want to do? You want to hike into the park, or go to a sound bath? What the hell is a sound bath? It sounds like bullshit, but it's actually really cool. Um... they play these crystal bowls, and the way the sound waves resonate, you feel totally fucked up afterward... In a good way. Hiking sounds great. Really glad you came out here, man. I know it's not as fun as partying it up in the dorms. The dorms are closed over break, so... Ah, of course. How your grades doing? Here comes the Dad phase. Coming up into the Mom phase, "Are you seeing anyone?" Well, are ya? No. Life energy thrives when you're with someone, man. I'm playing the field. Okay. Well, generally, you're supposed to score - at some point while playing the field. - Okay, Jesus! Too far with the Mom phases, here. I'm your brother, and you need someone to take an interest. You still the slow one? Come on! Bet you I'll beat you to that rock! Come on, bro! Seriously? Peyton, wait up! God damn it. Every time we go hiking. Ohh! See? It's an overhand knot, and you tie it with one loop. Gorgeous, huh? Yeah, it's something. Mmm. Come on. Come here. - Hold on, come on. - What? - Oh, God! - Yep. Ready? One, two, three. All right. Look like you like me. One, two, three. Kind of. Trying to improve my social media following. Which one? The one in the hat. What should I caption this? Uh, go talk to him. No. No. Camille! Camille! Camille! Hey, guys! - Hi, I'm Camille. - What are you doing? Oh, my God. Hey, I'm... I'm Evan. - Peyton. - Cool. Oh, my God. You want to smoke with us? Uh, appreciate the offer, but I don't smoke. Okay. How about you? Yeah... if you're offering. We got other places to see, dude. Come on, Peyton. We can hang out up there for a sec. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Hey, Zoe, don't be antisocial. This is Evan. What up? Tori. Haley. Nice to meet ya. - I'm Vanessa. - Hey, man, I'm Bryan. - Tallyho! My name's Winston. - His name is Nico. - Damn it, Zoey. - Yo. That's Max. He's a dick. - Sam, introduce yourself. - Pay him no mind. Hey, I'm Sam. What's up? Hi, I'm Zoe. I'll be right... Next Ansel Adams? Jesus, no. I just need something to put on the walls of my shitty apartment. Here you go, dude. Thanks, man. All right. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Hold out your wrist. If you wrap it around... There you go. One friendship rabbit. It all looks good. They all look the same to me. Wait. Is that a race car lighter? Yeah. I promise you I'm not a redneck. - Right. - No, this is my brother's, - Right, right. - And, uh, he was really into race cars. - Your brother was? - When we were kids, yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. - I promise. I promise. - Yeah. I stole it from him when I was, like, 11 or 12. He just... He let me keep it. Sure. After the bet on the race. Uh... is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. He just... He doesn't like drugs. Ooh. That's funny. He looks like the kind of guy I buy shit from. Yeah. Yes, he does. I don't know. He's, uh... He's just, like, high on life or something like that. Must be nice. Yeah. - But of lenses. - Do we have anymore weed? Ah. Fish-eye kind of thing? Yeah, it, like, works pretty amazing. Guys, it's late. Let's get the hell out of here. Um... yeah. Bryan. Bryan, come on. How do I jump down this rock? Whoa! Here, I'll help you. - Ready, bud? - One second. So what are you guys doing now? Uh, headed back to the place where we're staying, I guess. It's getting kind of late. Zoe! Zoe. Hey! Did Zoe tell you we're renting a house? She didn't. That sounds sick. You should come back with us. - Excuse me? - Oh, come on! We have a spare couch. It'll be fun. Peyton, you can come, too. We're going to barbecue and maybe play some drinking games. Thanks, but I don't drink, either. Sick. Yeah, I shouldn't. My brother and I have plans. Oh. - Yeah. - Okay. Cool. Cool. Well, it was nice to meet you. Yeah. You, too. Well, I tried. If you're going to invite a stranger... I got to introduce you to my biking buddies. I think you'd really like them. We'll take you out on the trails one day. - Shit, dude. You got to go. - What? For fuck's sake, run back there. I'm not going to stand in the way of you and a girl. Yeah, but I... I mean, this is the only time I get to see you. We have the whole rest of the weekend. Go, dude. Before you lose 'em. Thanks, Peyton. I'll, uh, see you later. Hey, guys, wait up! Biking buddies. Fucking dumb-ass. You and Peyton have some unresolved issues, huh? What gave it away? I don't know. Maybe the fact that you chose this group of fucked-up strangers over him? I took a gamble. Ah, thank God. We are almost there. My legs are killing me. Wow, looks awesome. Yeah, it's got an interesting vibe. Kind of sixties. Anyone feeling tequila shots? Yes. - Come on. - Yeah! All right. Evan, stand over here. So do you only have tequila? Yeah. Do you like tequila? - No, I love it, obviously. - Right. Right. Cheers. Cheers! Whoo! - Oh! - Owww! And the flight attendant, she just stared at me. And she said, "I think you must be confused. There was no passenger in 23A." Oh. 'Every time I came by with the drink cart, you were just sitting there, talking to yourself.' That's good. That's good. So good. Okay. Sam, that was terrifying. All right. New kid, you're up. Damn it. Do I have to? - Yes! - Yeah, you do. Come on. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Here. Okay, I don't know this website, so I'll just choose a random one. Um, this one's called. "Hisji, Hisji, Hisji, Hisji... Hisji." Uh... what? That's the title, I think. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right though. Um, here goes. "A Hisji is a vengeful thing." Five times its name, you never sing. "With skin pale white and eyes of green, it's something you've already seen." This is fucking weird. You sure you're reading it right there, Evan? That's what it says. Um... "It's here. It's there. It's there. It's here." Provoke its form and disappear. A Hisji is a vengeful thing. "Five times its name, you never sing." Is that supposed to be scary or... Jesus. If Vanessa's not scared, you know you fucked up. Shit. Sorry, guys. I guess I picked the lamest one on there. Yeah, well, I think that's enough scary stories for tonight. Okay. I know what's going to warm us all up. Cinnamon whiskey shouts. - Cinnamon whiskey... - Let's go! Shouts! The cinnamon was good. I will shout cinnamon whiskey to the sky! Okay. I'm going to get in the hot tub. Sounds like a good move. I'll... I'll get the tequila. Be right back. Oh, fuck. Ah! Fuck. This is so hot. Shit. - Here. Take the tequila. - Thanks. Fuck! Ahh! See? I told you. More tequila. Jesus, this is a little hot right now. Oh! Oh! Yeah! Perfect spot out here. Totally fucking alone. No threat of a noise complaint. Nothing. So update me on the group dynamic. Well, a few of them are dating. Fuck. I don't know anybody's name, but try me. Okay. Um... Tori and Sam, Haley and Nico, Max and Vanessa, and Bryan and Camille. Jesus. How many couples is that? Uh, four. So basically everyone except for, you know, me. You're, like, the single one. Which makes me, what, the ninth wheel? Sweet. That's rough. That's three times rougher than the third wheel. It's okay. It's kind of nice not being tied down. True. - Sorry. - It's okay. - That's my foot. - It's okay. You never see stars like this in I.A. Mmm. What was that? I don't know. Hello? Zoe, do you see that? What? Looks like a tree... or cactus or something. Yeah. Well, I'm ready to get out. - It's pretty hot. - Yeah. I am, too. Thanks. It's cold. Oh, shit. Pass me a towel. - Here. - I'm freezing. I know. Okay, let's go. Let's go in. I got to tell ya. Creepy out here at night. Yeah. Pretty dark. Okay, here, let's go. - Sorry. Sorry, sorry. - Awesome. Okay. Yeah, awesome. Uh, what the fuck were you two doing out there? Max, your turn. Come on, Max. Hey. Hey, you guys good or what? Where are you going? Sam, turn the music down. What happened? What happened? - Nothing. We thought we saw somebody. - It's fine. - Did your lame-ass brother decide he wanted - to join the party after all? - Max! What the fuck are you saying, man? I'm just saying he sat there and watched us all day, and then you see somebody creeping outside? It was nothing, Max. We were just seeing things. Sam, turn the music back up. Guys, just drink more. You'll forget all about it. - Oh, yes! - Definitely drink more. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on! Two games out of three! Lame! Evan! Come take a shot with me. Hold on. Forget it. He knows nothing. Yeah. Mm. I have better tequila in my room. All right then. Morning. Okay. Um, Sam, Tori. Bryan, Camille. Haley, Nico. Max, Vanessa. What the... Evan? - Fuck! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Jesus! You scared the shit out of me! I'm sorry. What the hell are you doing out here? - What's that thing? - I don't even know. Just, uh... Let's, uh... Let's go back inside. Okay. All right. How are you feeling? Like, uh, somebody's excavating my skull. How about you? Not too bad, all things considering. So, back to Peyton today? Nah. I can't ditch you guys now. I had too much fun last night. Well, good. I did, too. Are those cooked enough? Are you sure you had fun last night? Yeah, of course, I had so much fun. I got, like, no sleep last night. Wow. You guys waste no time. Not all of us start the party at 9:00 a.m. Yo! Anyone want to do shrooms with breakfast? Oh, my God! Not again, Nico. Fine. Good morning, Camille. Mmm! Morning. Morning. Good morning, love birds. Ooh! 'Cause somebody needed a quick one, right? Camille! All right, finish up, people. Try and get to this place. Where are we going? This really cool spot in the hills. You can see, like, the whole park from this one peak. Sweet. Anyone who's riding in my car has to be outside in ten minutes. So, how was it? - Come on, let's go. - No, Zoe. - Got to give me some deets. - Camille, stop! Ugh! Guys, I don't care what car you're taking... - Seriously, Bryan? - Get in a car. Five eggs and a whole pack of bacon wasn't enough? - Where's Camille? - We're going to be late. Come on! All right, we got everyone? - Let's get the fuck outta here. - Finally. Wait. No. You're missing somebody. It's Bryan. He's in there stuffing his face. What? No, babe, I'm here. No, the, uh... The... the... that other girl. Um, blond hair. She was... She was... Camille's the token blonde. New guy's a lightweight. Has a few hits, he starts hallucinating. I mean, it's strong shit, dude. I mean, your first time, you... Whoo! Ooh, that step. All right. Thank you, friends. Seatbelts. Everyone, seatbelts. Haley, you too. Seatbelt. That's a jumping cholla. Why do they call it jumping? Does it jump? The spikes come closer toward the heat at the bottom. Careful of the pointy ones. Like this one? Yes. Oh my God! Bryan, don't touch that! - Why? - Because it will stick you. Stick me? Yeah, I thought I warned you about those. One time I touched one, and it did not end well. You touched one? Oy, that was a day. But, like, that's the boring side of things. Can we go here? I mean, the ratings say that that's... I know what you're saying, but look at that one. You're a natural. I'm going to go in for a close-up. - It's all in the eyes. - If you hold it up to the light... You hold it up, you can see through it. I know. - I studied rocks in college. - Come on. Guys, let's go. Bryan, let's go. Shouldn't we go with them? No. It's so quiet out here. Yeah, it is. It's great for photos. Do you think it was a good idea to split up? Uh, yeah, they'll catch up to us. My brother tried to get me to hike this peak once before. Yeah? Well, it's famous for the views. Jesus! Gotta be from the rodeo crowd we saw on the way in. 'Merica! What the hell is there to shoot out here anyway? Unsuspecting teenagers. It's not fucking funny, Haley. It's pretty funny. It's pretty funny. No, it is. What the fuck? I'm just waiting for someone's head to explode. It's a shotgun, babe, not a sniper rifle. Also, like, let's be honest. They're not going to go for us. They would go for Max. Sniper's dream with that head of his. I think they'd go for Evan, seeing as he's the new kid. Oh, shit. Shots fired. Literally? Don't worry, Evan. They wouldn't go after you. They'd shoot Vanessa. She'd for sure be the first one to die. We have summited Everest. Oh, God! I'm out of breath! Oh! - Intense view. - Yeah, that is... Wow. Tremendous. Not bad. Not bad. This is beautiful. Look, honey, you see it? So you must come out here all the time thanks to your big brother, huh? Not so much. I actually try to avoid it as much as I can. Damn, dude. If I had family out here, I'd never leave. Yeah, well, the rocks and the trees get kind of old after a while. That, and sleeping on the floor of a trailer. Okay. See, what you got to do is you got to take psychedelics. You take, like, a new one each time you come out here so it's like a new experience each time. Yeah, I'm not trying to fry my brain, though. Yeah, ship's kind of sailed for me on that one. Shit. Sorry, man. I'm a dick. Your brain's probably totally fine, lightly toasted at worst. You don't know how much 2C-E I've done. Zoe! What the hell?! Oh, my God. My leg. You okay? Christ! Is it broken? Max! Where's Max?! Zoe, what the hell happened? - You just fell. You fell. - No. No. I didn't... Wait. Tori. Okay, guys. We need to get her up. All right. Sam, camera. Fuck! My camera! Okay, guys. What the fuck happened? You were probably just so wrapped up taking a photo, - you forgot where the edge was. - No! No. No, I took it standing still. One second I was up there, and now I'm down here. I... I didn't do anything. - We have to get her up, okay? - Yeah. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm there. Okay. Three, two, one. Let's go. - Aah! - Lift, lift, lift, lift! Okay. Okay. You're okay, you're okay. All right. Let's go. It's not broken. I told you guys I'm fine. It's really swollen. You got to stay off of it. I still think we should go to the hospital. No. I don't need the hospital. If we're going anywhere, we're going to the camera shop. Fuck! Jesus Christ. Okay, so you didn't fall, and you didn't walk off. So did somebody fucking push you? No. I don't know what happened. I... can't remember. Okay. Well, I say we go home. There's really no sense in staying out here. Especially not with the NRA fan boys over there. Yeah, I agree. My car's full. Oh, man. How do you not remember falling at all? That's the thing. I remember it fine. Okay, so if you remember it, why do you say you don't know what happened? It's just... It doesn't make any sense to me. It was like I lost complete control over myself. It was like I was a... A passenger in my own body. Okay. Um... have you been feeling off or different lately, like, before this? What are you asking? I don't know. Just... All set. Want to go back in there? Shit. You're limping. I'm not limping. Bryan? Oh, my God, you two. Come on, better take her! Your foot! Your foot! - You all right? - Yeah. Did it hurt? Did it hurt? Jesus, come on, babe. You're crazy. - I'm going to go get a beer. - All right. - You okay? - Yeah. Camille wrapped it, and then sat on it. Bryan, are you sure you know how to pack a bowl? Are you sure? Oh, wow, dude, you are... You're unbelievable. Kind of a little massage. Ah! Okay, little less. Little less. - Little less? - Yeah, thanks. Try not to tighten up. I try not to tighten up. I know. I know. There's definitely something strange going on here, something to do with that guy we saw by the Jacuzzi last night. Thought you said it was nothing. It wasn't. There was definitely someone standing there watching us. Yeah, your perv brother. We've been over this. It wasn't my fucking brother, and please don't call him that. I'm having a hard time believing you, but, so you stop bitching, I'll lock some doors for ya. This is all for you, Evan. Oh, the door is now locked, so is the deadbolt. Jesus. Door number two. Fuck! - Who is that?! - Shit! Max, who is it? Max? Open it. Come on, open it. Just open the door. Speak of the devil. Hey, there. Oh, God. Peyton, what the hell are you doing? Hey, everyone. Sorry to interrupt. Evan, what the hell, man? I... I thought something terrible happened to you. I... I just... I'm fine. I'm not ready to go home. Well, you just... You spent a whole 'nother day here, man. I know. I just... I can't leave right now. We're figuring shit out, and I got to make sure Zoey's okay. What happened? A fall? - No. - We're fine, Peyton. We just... We got it. Hey, um... Were you here last night? You know, watching us? What? No, of course not. Of course not. Okay. So, um, how the fuck did you find this house? - Oh! - Whoa, relax. I have the TeenSafe app. It's hooked up to GPS, so I always know where Evan is. Wait. Oh! So you track your brother like the goddamn NSA. Yeah, well, I've had to be more than a brother to Evan 'cause our parents are dead, so... yeah, I was just checking up on my brother to make sure he's okay, if that's all right with all of you. Of course. Of course. You should bring him home. Who knows what kind of shenanigans he'll get into - with us, right, guys? - Max, shut up! Evan, you can do whatever you want to do. Okay? I'm staying. Peyton, you should go. Okay, uh... Call me if you need anything. Come on, guys. We're on vacation. Who's down for shots? - Oh, amen! - Amen! Whoo! Me! Gonna be a rematch. Don't have to ask me twice for shots! Has anyone seen my hat? Let's play some drinking games. Beer pong. Pong this up! You like some? Come on. All right. Any hat will do. Get some red cups. So what are we drinking tonight? Tequila. Obviously. Okay, okay, okay. Vanessa, you are up. Okay, I never remember the rules, so... God damn it, Vanessa! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Um, five, five is... - No! - Thanks for playing. Five is jive. - No! - Yes. Five is jive. You get up and dance. Dance, dance, dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Okay. Okay, that... That could be a dance. All right, okay. Zoe, I'm very impatient today. You're up. - I picked a jack. - Yes! Yes! Never have I ever. Put 'em up! Put 'em up! All right, never have I ever... Oh, I have one. Jerked off in a public restroom. Eww! Eww! Sam, you fuckin' liar. Put your finger down. - That's okay, baby. - Every guy has done it. Next! Next! Next! Next! Okay, all right, uh... never have I ever... uh, worn makeup. - Oh, come on. Really? - That one's stupid. You are just killing me over here. Okay, uh, let's see. - This sucks. - Snooze fest. Never have I ever... - gone down on a girl. - Ohh! Everybody, down, down, down, down, down. Oh, sure, that's the one that you own up to. Okay. - Miss Tori. - Okay, um... - Miss Tori. - Miss Tori. Uh, never have I ever, um... Oh! Never have I ever had my dick sucked. Ooh! You don't even have a dick! It just wouldn't count! - How would you know, Nico? - She has a huge dick. - Yeah. - Rando dicks. Yeah, I'm sure you do. Love you, Bryan. All right. Sam, master of bullshit, you're up. What? Whoa! Hey! - Aw shit. - Oh, my God! - Bryan? - What the hell was that? Uh, power outage, I think. Yeah, scared the shit outta me. - Yeah. - Wait, wait. Okay, well, where's the vodka? - Sam, what the fuck? - What? You were just right fucking here. You were literally just next to me. How the hell did you do that? What are you talking about, babe? - Ugh! - What...? Uh, has someone got a flashlight? - There's one right here. - Shit. Thanks, man. I don't see anything. Guys, this... this is stupid. Let's just go to the front of the house. - I've been here the whole time. - Fucking haven't, Sam. You were in another room playing a game. - He was my partner. - No. Well, the breakers are all good, so I don't know what's going on. - You okay, babe? - No, I'm not okay. Uh, Sam, little confused here. How did you get over here so fucking fast? What the fuck are you talking about? I've been here for, like, an hour. You fucking liar! You were sitting right next to me! Did Nico spike your shit with shrooms? We've been in here playing two on two for the last 20 minutes. Me and Sam against Haley and Bryan. I-I don't know. Did you, Nico? What the fuck! No! I didn't... Why would I do that? - That's not me! - Totally would, Nico. No, I fucking wouldn't! Guys, come on. This is ridiculous! Okay, wait. Everybody just shut the fuck up. Oh, here we go. There was somebody sitting there. What if it wasn't Sam? But it was. How do you know? We're all pretty fucked up right now, but we're with it enough to know somebody was sitting there. Nope, nope. Oh, babe, come on! No. No, no, no, no. I don't see anything. What the fuck? No, seriously. What the fuck? Someone needs to explain this shit. I'm getting pissed off at all of you. - Haley, baby. - No, Nico. - Should we call the police? - Yes. - No! Nooo! - Yes! No! No. Relax, okay? We've all been drinking. We're probably just confused. - No! - What?! What if that person is still in the house? Oh, my God. Can you not? For fuck's sake! Max, no! Sam, you go. Grab that knife. Sam, what the fuck are you doing? I don't know! Vanessa told me! - Ugh! - I'm going with them. I'll stay here with Camille. That's weird. Yeah, we should check the, um... What was that? Kick a cup? Try not to kick cups, please. Okay, this one works. Okay. Uh... - Huh! - Jesus. Okay. Sam, go on. Is the power out in here, too? Fucking breaker? Oh! What the fuck? Okay. Bathroom clear. Okay. That's weird. That's fucking weird. Uh... Nobody. I swear there was someone else. Oh, my God! Fucking Max. So? There was nobody else in the house. Jesus, we must be high off our asses. What the hell are we supposed to do in there with the lights out? We'll stay here. It's fine. Not Kings Cup. Something else, please. Look. Fuck games. Let's just stick to what we know and just drink. Ooh. Ooh. And smoke. Have ourselves a little doobie. I swear I didn't put anything in anyone's drink. Stop bringing it up. Yeah, sure. Okay, dude, whatever. What's up, dude? Morning. Made you a bracelet. - Thanks, man. - Yeah, dude. Oh, shit. Lights are back on. Nice. Oh, God. You guys were pretty fucked up last night. Is Zoe's ankle doing any better? Didn't check. She seemed to sleep all right though. That's good. What? Just making sure Max isn't listening. They were together before? - Yeah. - She dumped him. Then she picks up some rando on a weekend trip. - Yep. - Yeah. Guess I'd be pissed, too. I mean, Max does not have your insane ability to tell scary stories though. So you got that going for you. That's right. That was an instant panty-dropper, wasn't it? Wh-what was it called, um, the Five Monster? No, no, no. Uh... - Hissky. It was called Hissky. - That's right, Hissky. Yo, you got a lighter? Hissky. Hissky, that's right, yeah. Hissky, whiskey. Do we have any whiskey left? "Hisji." It was called "Hisji." Uh-huh. I'll be right back, guys. You want your lighter back? - Yeah, thanks for that. - Yep. Thank you very much. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck, no. Evan? Zoey. Hey, um, look, so I... I think that I should be getting back to Peyton today. I just think... You okay? Did you get out here by yourself? Yeah. It's... It's better today. Right, okay. Um... So, I just... I really think that. I should spend at least some time with my brother. Don't leave me. - Zoey... - Just... don't leave me, please. Okay. I won't. The boys are leaving soon. They're going to the mines. You go in Nico's car. I'll ride with Max. He's already mad. Yeah, I know. Um, mind if I go get ready real quick? Go. I'll probably already be out there when you get back. Okay. Hey, can you pack this? Thanks. Evan? We're leaving. Come on. One second. Whoo! You picked a hell of a weekend to tag along with the crew, Evan. - Nico? - Yeah. - Tell the truth. - Okay. Did you spike our shit last night? You dick! No! I didn't! Honest, swear to... Hand on God, like, Bible! I didn't! Jeez! Well, then I have to say I'm disappointed that we hallucinated Sam and not. - Anderson Cooper. - Anderson Cooper. I do not understand your fascination with that man. God, 'cause he's a god. I don't think we hallucinated him. And I think he might be an alien. - Wait. What did you say? - What? Nico, stop the car! Fuck! We're okay. We're okay. Everyone's okay. We're fine. We're fine. I guess. Hello. Ugh. All right. I heard the coolest one's up there. It's fine! No one died! Where the fuck is Zoey? What? Where's Zoey? She said that she was going with Max. What the fuck is he talking about? Yeah, Zoey couldn't come. She couldn't even get out of bed. No. No, no, no, no. She... I talked to her. She was sitting on the... On the porch. She specifically told me she was going in Max's car. Okay. This fool's crazy. Confirmed. I'm just gonna pretend like he doesn't exist, so I can actually enjoy the last day of my vacation. - Max, hold on. - What? Evan, I saw Zoey right before we left. She was in her room with everyone. She was in bed. No, she said that her ankle was doing a lot better. No, dude. It was a lot worse. That's why Haley and them stayed behind so they could keep an eye on her. How many of them are there back at the house? Five? We've got to go back there right now! - Evan, wait! - Hey, that's my car! Wait, Evan, where are you going?! - What... - Wait! Let me in. What is happening? Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Close the door! - Evan! - That... That story I was reading, - "The Hisji"? - What?! - I think it fucked us, okay? - You need to start explaining. I know this sounds fucking insane, but I think I started something, summoned something. Okay, can you just pull over right now? You're going really fast. I don't want anything to happen. - You can do whatever you want... - Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm not insane. Think about it. You were there when Sam was in two places at once, and that is not the first time that's happened this weekend. It happened with Sam during Kings Cup. It happened with Tori when Zoey fell. There's been an extra person the whole time? Yeah, right in front of us, and we had no idea. I finished that story, and it fits. It fucking fits! I don't know why, but this thing has it in for groups of five. If we don't get back there, something bad's gonna happen, something terrible. What the fuck just happened? This car's a piece of shit. Evan! - Let's go! - Hold up! Wait for me! Zoe? What the fuck? Oh, my God. - What is that? - Camille? What's that sound? Fuck! Fuck! Oh, my God. Shit. Zoe! Zoe! Zoe, what happened? Are you hurt? Zoe! No. Zoe? What happened? Zoe? Zoe, where are they? They made their own choices. - What? - They'll live together forever. Fuck! Camille. Camille?! What do you mean? Zoe? Nobody in there! Camille? Slow down, Max! They're coming. Camille? - Who's coming? - Get away from her! Camille! That isn't Zoe! You didn't have to fucking speed. One... Two... Camille! New kid. Three... Wait! Wait up! Four... Five. What the fuck is wrong with you?! Zoe? Zoe, what... Your ankle. What are you doing? Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Wait! Nico, Nico, Nico! Help me! - Nico, help me! Please! - I got her! I got her! Come on! - Open the door! - It's fucking jammed! Open the door! - It's jammed! - Open the door! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Help me! - What is that?! No! Wait, get the couch! Make a tourniquet or something! She's dead! Fuck! Why would she do that?! - It made her do it! - Oh, fuck! What the fuck is that thing?! Shit! This doesn't make any sense! Fuck! Help! - Don't go, man! - Dude, get the fuck outta my way! My girlfriend's out there! No, she's not! That's that fucking... That's definitely fucking her! - No, it's not! - It is! - It has to be her! - Dude, no! Nico! Where the fuck is she? Where the fuck... It's okay. That wasn't Haley. Haley's fine. I'm sure Haley's fine. I can't fuckin' do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. It's okay. I'm sure we'll be okay. Um, Evan? Nico! Nico! Let me in! They're going to kill me! Nico! Help me! What the fuck is that thing?! The couch! Push it up! Push! Push! Push! Shit! Aah! Shit! Aah! What the fuck?! Where'd it go? Oh, my God! You fucking liar! You were sitting right next to me! My camera! What is it saying? Max! Where's Max?! So you didn't fall, and you didn't walk off, so did somebody fucking push you? They'd shoot Vanessa. She'd for sure be the first one to die. What does it want?! It wants us! Is it... Is it gone? Evan! - We're leaving! - Evan. It'll be fun. Come. Evan. What the hell, man, I... I thought something terrible happened to you. Guys? Vanessa. Guys, what are you doing? Guys? Camille! Nico! Nico. Oh, my God, Nico! Max, get that off your face! Nico, what are you doing? Please! Nico! Nico, don't drink that! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nico! Why would you do that?! Nico! Oh, my God! Max! Max, get that off your head! Max! Stop it! Stop it, Max! Stop it, Nico! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Guys! Oh, my God, Vanessa! Holy shit! No! What? No, I... I can't! Where... Oh, shit! Help... Oh, my God! How do I get... How do I get out of here?! Shit! Shit! Oh, God. Wait. Wait. Please. Please. Please. Please. - Hey, it's Peyton... - Hey, Peyton. Peyton. I don't answer my phone very often, because I am enjoying life, so leave me a message, and I'll probably call you back. Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey, it's Peyton. I don't answer my phone very often, because I am enjoying life, so leave me a message, and I'll probably call you back. Hey, Peyton. Um, listen, if you get this, can you... can you please come back to the house where you found me last night? Um, I'm kind of... Oh, my God. I... I really need your help. I'm in a lot of trouble here. Look, I'm so sorry. And I just... Love you, and if... If I don't see you... Goodbye. No, no, no. No. No. Evan. Oh, God. Fuck. We'll all be together now. Evan! Hello? Hello? Evan? Shit. Peyton? Jesus, dude! You scared the shit out of me! - Sorry, man. - Ahh! Where is everybody? Just left. Everything okay? Sorry, dude, I didn't get your voicemails till just now. No problem. I'm just, uh... ready to get out of here. Okay. Great. Me, too. Hey, Peyton? Yeah, buddy. I'm sorry I've been such an asshole to you. You haven't been, dude. You're... You're fine. Don't... Don't even worry about it, man. Come on. Let's go. So, we got one more day before you have to go back. What do you want to do? I don't know. How about I introduce you to some of my friends. I think you'll really dig 'em. They're super chill people. Huh? Sounds perfect.
