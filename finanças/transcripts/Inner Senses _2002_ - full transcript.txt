Here to see the apartment? Yes. Come in. It's not locked. Okay. Come up please. Ok. This way please. It's a nice apartment. Spacious and quiet. If you like it, the rent is negotiable. Over here. The kitchen is huge. So is the bedroom and sitting room. The wallpaper is kind of old. But I can repaint the walls for you. What color would you like? How about pink? This kind of apartment is hard to come by. Although there is no lift, you can treat it as exercise. I'll never understand the young nowadays. They're only willing to waste money at the gym. Well? The rent is very reasonable. Windows are facing southeast. Very sunny. No need to turn on the lights during the day. Open the windows and the air is fresh. No need for air-conditioning during summer. Saves electricity. Rent is $8,500. Very cheap already. What do you say? I'll rent it. Good. I don't need to... May I have your name? Yan Cheung. Call me Yan. Chu. I live down the hall. I live alone. This apartment is too big for me. Ah one more thing. The wires are a bit old. If there's a short-circuit... come here and flip this back down. I hope you won't change your mind. No. How many of you are living here? One. You live alone? My family is in Australia. So many floors and no lift. It's hard to make a living. Too bad you're poor. Hey, move faster. Just keep going. Shall we put the sofa here? That's fine, thanks. The leg of the desk is loose. Is it an antique? - Thanks. - Is it valuable? - $1,800 right? - Yes. Keep the change. Thank you. I'm here because you told me to. I told you to? Don't you remember? Remember what? What you said to the sky that day. Why did you bring me here? No, you came here on your own... and I will always follow you. So you have come. Stay here tonight with me. Let me hug you. Shut up. I don't think any of you know... This is a graveyard during World War ll. The Japanese shot hundreds of people here. I used to come and sit here to take a break. One night, I saw a man with a bloody face sitting next to me. A horrifying sight. I think a bullet entered the back of his head and came out the front. That's why there was a big hole on his face. Even his teeth were exposed. Are you scared? You should all know that apart from thinking and analyzing... our brains have one other major function. And that is collecting information. Our brains have been absorbing information since birth. Accumulating knowledge and experience. And absorbing information about ghosts. Ghosts are stories we hear from our families, friends... religion, films and radio programs. The idea of ghosts penetrates our brains through various ways... making most of us believe there are ghosts. Information is analyzed and transformed into image in your brains. Just like the ghost I've just described to you. Every detail I've said big hole on his face... teeth were exposed etc. Your brains immediately transform stored information into image. Let me try an experiment on you... to prove that ghosts exist in your brains. In your brains, you'll have... The servants of hell. Are they like this? Remember their faces? And there must be... Vampire. I'm sorry, Dr Law. I do not know these Chinese ghosts. Does that mean ghosts have no influence on me? No. Although you have no images of Chinese ghosts... you still have images of other ghosts. For example... The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. And... Dracula. Right? The Chinese are strange. Parents like to use ghosts to teach their children. "lf you're naughty, ghosts will come and get you." You listen to this since you're kids. How can you not believe in ghosts? But try and remember what happened in the last 30 years. Have you heard of any news reporting a ghost killing a man? No. Because it's only stored information. Useless information playing tricks in your brains. So I hope you will not mention the word "ghost" again. Dr Law, you really do not believe in ghosts? If I say there are ghosts, you'll be reminded of them. If you believe in ghosts, then they will exist. I don't think you've answered my question. I don't believe in ghosts. Dr Law, do you believe in god? Sorry, Professor Fong. I forgot you studied theology. I did not mean to strike down your theory... God is not theory. Do you have any religious beliefs? Not at the moment. Not sure when I get older though. When I can no longer explain the world by scientific means... I may need a religion. May God bless you. Sorry, Jim. Don't worry about it. Why are you here? Why did you come back? Aren't you on holiday? Yes. Was going to spend it with my husband in Thailand. But the plane tickets were left here. - Stop bragging. - I'm so careless. Very rare for my husband to agree to go. Why are there so many case files? They're all from Dr Chan. He asked you to check your voice mail for his message. I forgot to turn on my phone. I'm leaving now ok? Ok, have a good time. - Bye. - Bye. Jim, this is Wilson. I want to introduce you to a beauty. She is my wife's cousin. You know how complicated things could become. It may end up involving the family. So I don't want to take the case. Only a workaholic like you will take this job. I've arranged the meeting already. She'll be at your clinic at 9 am tomorrow. Don't call me even if it's necessary. My wife has granted me a holiday and I am going on a trip. Bye. I wish I could have a holiday. Can l? You may lower your hands now. Your hands tell me you are an artist. You play the piano? I wanted to be a writer but failed. I now translate scripts. A writer must be full of imagination. You can be more direct with your questions. I have a lot of experience with doctors. Even my cousin's husband cannot cure me. If you don't trust doctors, why do you come to see me? My cousin forced me to come here. I don't have psychiatric problems. What do you think your problem is? I see ghosts. Tell me what you see. Do you believe in ghosts? I do. The universe is huge enough for anything. The last time was a week ago. I was taking a bath. And I heard the voice of a man. And then I saw him standing behind me. What was he doing? He was looking at me... and crying. What did he look like? I saw his face clearly at that moment. But I can't remember now. When did you first see him? I am really not sick. I've taken all kinds of medicine. I know what I saw were not illusions. I'm just someone who can see ghosts all the time. Did you notice every sentence you said had the word "l" in it? One sentence even had two "l"s. You said you're not sick and have taken all kinds of medicine. You're both self-confident and self-centered. You don't need a doctor at all. Just give me some vitamins. That'll satisfy my cousin. She's the one who wanted me to come. I feel uncomfortable every time I'm in a clinic. I'm not sick. I'm not sick. You can still chat with me even if you're not sick. You have to pay me anyways. Your cousin will suspect if you leave so soon. You said you want to be a writer, so you must have a lot of stories. I'll listen if you'll tell me. If you don't want to tell me, then I'll tell you something. Humans are often very fragile. Discontent may accumulate to become a hang-up. Even if you want to tell your family or friends... they may not know how to comfort you. Therefore it's most important for you to learn one thing. And that is to calm down and to love yourself. Perhaps you can tell me. I may be able to help. You'll feel better after you've cried. You have my card. You can call me anytime. This is yours. You've forgotten something. - Bye. - Bye. What did he say? Nothing. He said I'm fine. Really? My husband said he's a great doctor. Why not stay at my place tonight? My husband is on a trip. No thanks. I want to walk around on my own. You really don't want to come? You go home first. Your son is waiting for you. You can call me no matter how late it is. Ok. "The pills you want. Careful of side effects." It does not leak in the past. Is it leaking heavily now? No. Just a bit. I'll fix it for you. You have your dinner first. Why don't you have dinner here? I'll fix it for you after dinner. No, thanks. Don't worry. It's very simple. I'll fry the veggies first. It's a long time since I've had dinner with someone at home. There are not enough dishes. More than enough. Is that your family? My wife and son. Not here anymore. They died in an accident. I am sorry. It's alright. But don't panic. They did not die in your apartment. It wasn't raining on that day. Or else my wife wouldn't have taken our son to the park. Who'd have guessed there would be a landslide. I was busy on that day. Or else I would've gone with them. I still remember how my son dragged my wife out the door happily. I even told them to have a great time. They never came back after that. Never mind. It was fate. It's most important to look ahead. That's why I became an insurance salesman to help other people. Precaution is better than cure. Don't worry. I won't persuade you to buy insurance from me. It was still raining when they went out. They will come back when the rain stops. I want them to change into clean shoes when they come back. The presents can wait till my son comes back. I always cook a bit extra. So that my wife can gain some weight. She's too thin. They'll come back sooner or later. Sorry...sorry. Excuse me, I have to leave. A neurologist once said... The brain of a human being is bigger than the universe. Because we know more about the universe than our brains. I agree. Another specialist said... Psychology and Psychiatry... are still in their stone age period. I agree with this even more. There are 6 billion people in this world. There are times when I can't even psycho-analyze myself. How can I psycho-analyze other people? The human brain is fascinating. Cells from different sections are all connected. Once there's a problem, it'll spread. Just like a sponge absorbing water. Any part that is wet is affected. Yan Cheung's case is very interesting. Problems from different parts of the brain within a few years. There must be an incident behind it. Her memory must be hiding something. Come out. Come out. I am not afraid of you. Hello. Come over here. What did you see? The wife and son of my landlord. They died in a landslide. Please take me away. No, don't go yet. Let me take a look. Lead me upstairs. Wait for me here. It could be the fuse. I'll get a torch from the car. Be careful. Say something. Why don't you make a sound when you walk? Are you ghosts? "l Will Follow You" Coffee. Thank you. Your desk is pretty. You're the first who doesn't think my desk is old. Your family gave it to you? My family is in Australia. You like old things? Sometimes. But I prefer new things. Perhaps because I'm optimistic. It was scary just now. But I'll treat it as a joke tomorrow. Will you do that? What I saw just now was... Follow me. Come in. It's alright. They're inside. It's you. Depressant. Constant insomnia will lead to a vicious cycle. You'll lose your appetite and your concentration. Then you'll have neurasthenia. And eventually, a nervous breakdown. I am not sick. Why do you go to a doctor when you have the flu? But won't let anyone know if your brain has a little problem? The Chinese has a bad habit of equating psychiatry with insanity. Insomnia is a psychiatric problem. Trust me. "See you at the clinic at 3 pm tomorrow. Jim." Some doctors like to use hypnosis. It's not what I prefer. Why make a patient remembe what he chose to forget? It won't help the situation at all. There must be a reason why one chooses to forget. When pain reaches a threshold, one will lose consciousness. Every reaction of the brain has a reason. I read my patients' diaries... because they can shorten the time... for me to understand them. Don't go. She wrote the words on the mirror. She is the one who created everything. It is called a self-fulfillment prophecy. There is something she cannot let go. But looking at it from another angle... she really wants to forget it. She looks rational on the surface. But she is actually very fragile. She longs for someone to help her. But the major problem is... she doesn't know she has a problem. Why don't you come in to see me? I thought you have a patient inside. No. Sorry, I slept till 4 pm. It's good if you can sleep. Have you eaten yet? Let's go get some food. Sure. Would you mind telling me about those scars? I don't know if you'll believe what I say. But I really don't remember anything about them. I believe you. Everytime I woke up, I was already in the hospital. Our brains are very amazing. They collect useless information. And then release them intermittently. Do you still remember what the gate of your primary school looks like? I remember very clearly. Because there was an accident. Right outside the gate, a man was run over by a bus... and he was squashed to death. Some of my classmates went over to look at it for fun. They still come to see me now because they are still afraid. Have you seen the face of a dead person at a funeral parlor? Our thoughts are always shifting. They cannot be controlled. Memory mixed with images... will write and direct themselves... into a series of illusions. Then what should I do? Be patient. I'll help you. What do you see? Black and white stripes. And now? A dollar coin. So what you see is not always real. If you want to know yourself better... I can do a test for you. When? Tonight? You like milk candies? It makes a person happier. But I'm afraid of the side effects. I'll be fat. Ah, you can tell a joke. But you really are a bit fat. You sit here. I'll go get something. You live alone? Yes. Are you lonely? I'm just not too active. Don't treat me like I have a problem. Why do you read so many books? I want to understand other people. Although the hardest to understand is yourself. Huh? It's most difficult for a person to understand himself. Switch it on in the evening. Then change the tape every morning. It'll record everything for you. You'll see everything clearly when you wake up. Nothing has actually happened. Take it only when you need it. The other doctors never gave them to me. They're afraid you'll kill yourself? I trust you. Good morning sir. So how's the girl? What girl? My wife's cousin. Isn't she pretty? Nice treat. We're friends. I always save the best for you. Right. Friends are for mocking and betraying. Why do you say that? You always like a challenge. So can you handle it? Look at my face. Not bad. Can you supply any reference on her? She's self-centered and she thinks highly of herself. But she lost her boyfriend to a plain Jane. She couldn't accept the fact. So she lost control, committed suicide and broke down. Then she started seeing illusions and went mad. That's it. She's your relative. Jim, I'm not responsible. Her parents divorced when she was 12. Both remarried and immigrated. Both didn't want her. If it was me, I would have psychiatric problems. You're cold-blooded. What can I do? Tell her to live with us so my wife can take care of her? No way. Who knows if she... What? She says she sees ghosts. I believe her. All mental in-patients claim they see ghosts. Hong Kong is so crowded already. Where do ghosts live? How do you know for sure they're not seeing ghosts? When you're young, you're afraid of nothing. When you're old enough, you'll have doubts. When you're really old, you'll believe in everything. That's why I say you're old. I'm old? No way. No ghosts? Don't say that. Dr Law recorded this for you? Yes. Standing here all night must be tough. It's pre-set. I thought he spent the night here. Of course not. When are you seeing him again? I'm seeing him 3 times a week. The more the better. What are you talking about? Nothing. Just want you to have more friends. Once you know each other, then fall in love. Then get married, have children, have grandchildren... Have children again, then grandchildren... But I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I'll behave strangely again. And he'll leave me. Just let it be. Don't take everything so seriously. You've got nothing to lose. Just see him more. And tell him to examine this. No, you need an examination. Here! One more lap. I can't catch up to you. You alright? No need to sterilize it? No need. I'm just a psychiatrist. Not a surgeon. Then how do you cure my heart? Swimming. Exercise will make the brain secrete Endophin and Serotonin. It makes a person happier. Swimming alone is boring. When you keep on swimming... your thoughts won't wander and you'll feel refreshed. My thoughts are not wandering. Do you know why I brought you here? Because I am bored too. My family has immigrated and I don't have many friends. I mean real friends. There must be a distance between doctors and patients. They can't be too close. You understand what I'm saying? Yes. Sorry. - What I mean is... - It's ok. I won't be a nuisance anymore. I know I hurt her today. But I can't let her depend on me. I'm beginning to feel afraid. I don't know if I'm afraid of you or myself. Perhaps the present situation is the best for both of us. I am nothing without you. Don't leave me. "l won't bother you anymore. Please forgive me." There's no need for her to torture herself. "Help Me...Help Me...Help Me..." Mr Law. Are you alright? What time is it? It's 9 am. 9 am? I slept for a whole day. Hello. Speaking. Her landlord found her unconscious. With blood all over the floor. How many depressants did you give her? 20 Dormicums, 15 mg each. She took them all. The cut was deep but luckily it was off the mark. I had no idea that would happen. I never expected that. I am sorry. It's not your fault. She's always like that. She likes to commit suicide. When a guy leaves her, she'll say she's seeing ghosts. I should've warned you earlier. Whenever she falls for a guy, she's like that. Don't worry. She'll be fine. I'm going to the washroom. Why are your hands trembling? And you've dark circles round your eyes. I took some pills to sleep last night. It's this morning. There's nothing between us. Did I say there is? What I mean is I'm fine. So I misunderstood what you just said? If you think she needs another doctor... No, no need. There's no need. Yan Cheung's case is... I'll handle Yan Cheung's case. Trust me, ok? Looking for Ms Cheung? Yes. She's in the hospital. I know. I'm here to pack some things for her. Sai, sorry that we're bothering you. Always screaming about ghosts. Both of you are crazy. No ghosts, no ghosts. Trust me. There're no ghosts. Poor girl. She was really scared. How is she? Under observation. She should've told me earlier. There's no need to be afraid of them. Afraid of who? My wife and my son. They think I am still living here. I shouldn't have moved. I've waited for years. Please let me see them. What are you doing? It's my fault. I should've notified them earlier. I've to burn two more letters at the park... You're crazy. - What are you doing? - She lives alone... and you tell her ghost stories. Are you insane? How old are you? They're not ghosts. They won't harm people. - What are you doing? - Switch the electricity back on. Hurry up. There's a ghost... What do you want? Don't you dare fool around with the water pipes again. You'll pay for it. Leaving? I know you won't come back to see me. Because you don't believe I can cure you. But before I close your file... Iet me show you something. I read your diary. And I've talked to your family. I know about your past. So if you want to recover... you better listen to what I have to say. First you have to accept your past as the truth. You lost the protection of your family when your parents divorced. You had to fight for everything yourself. That made you very possessive. You didn't know how to handle your relationships with men. And you gave all your boyfriends a hard time. Because they couldn't tolerate the things you did. Your thoughts affected your behavior. And made you see ghosts and commit suicide. In fact, if you don't like some people or some things... try to forget them. If you can't forget them... then try to accept them. Because only then can you accept the truth... and be a real you... without abandoning yourself. Yan, look at me. Stop it. Look at me. The ghost is in your heart and you know who it is. Yan. Dr Law called us to come back together to see you. Tell them what's on your mind. I don't want to see them. Talk to them and you'll feel better. I don't want to see them. I don't want to see them. When will you stop hiding? Talk to them. I hate you both. Why didn't you want me? Why did you leave me? It's not my fault that you two did not get along. Why did you put the blame on me? I thought it was because I was not good enough. Don't say I'm the reason you quarreled. I tried so hard to do what you wanted me to do. I tried so hard to be a good daughter. Don't pretend that you care now. Look. - Yan. - Stop it. Leave. I don't want to see you. Yan. I can stand on my own and take care of myself now. You don't deserve my tears anymore. Just leave. Let it out. Cry and you'll feel better. Yan. I'll take care of her. Thank you. I think you owe me a gift. Laffite 82? Half a dozen. Want to die drinking? Jim, why haven't you come? Don't push me. Come on. Come see your friends. I don't have anything to say to them. Alright then. Ok, bye. I don't care. You've got to come this Sunday. My wife invited Yan to dinner. It's to thank you as well. You're not coming again. If you don't come, don't call me your friend anymore. It's me. Wilson told me to call you. I know you won't come. Thank you. Dr Law, you ok? Dr Law. How long have I slept? Almost 30 hours. Help me with some tests. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, uric acid build up... uneven heartbeat and unbalanced hormones. Are you sure? What is your problem? Doing Electronconvulsive Theraty on yourself. If the head nurse didn't unplug it and kept it a secret... you'd have been fired. What happened? You work too hard. All your friends worry you'll collapse one day. You work all day at the hospital and the clinic. You don't gamble and you don't do sports. Instead of sleeping at night, you read. Or you study your patients' files. Old classmates like Peter and George seldom come back to HK. When they ask you to dinner, you don't show up. You tell me why. Because you only have a master degree. How about me? I don't have anything. So I should kill myself? Your biggest problem is you care how others think of you. Any other problems? You need a woman. You told Yan you really cared for her... It's my method. You think I can't tell the difference? Although she was your patient, her case is now closed. There are no more ethical problems. I knew you long enough to know what you're thinking. But if there's really something unresolved... you better solve it fast. And if you want an ECT again... you call me. Basically... you're my only friend. I don't have many friends. Can you be my friend? Are you asking me out? What are you laughing at? Nothing. It has nothing to do with you. - What's up? - Can't I laugh? This one is pretty good. What is it? My ex-boyfriend. If you don't want to see him, we can leave. If you want to say hello, go ahead. Mike. Don't panic. I just want to say sorry. It's ok. I'm fine now. This is my boyfriend. No need for the introduction. I wish you happiness. Excuse me. You really scared him. Most people don't realize only the one in front of them is real. I'm your reality. Cheer up and let's go. This one... Think it over. I don't know why it's like that... To me, Hong Kong is kind of... Jim, there's someone staring at you outside. No. What are those two doing? They're staring at something. Ok, who's their doctor? Take care of it. Or they'll come in. Don't scare me. They're gone. Where were we? Driving. Let's change the topic. Last time you had an accident in Vancouver... Why aren't you dead yet? You can never escape. Die. Just die. You can never escape. Are you crazy? 1993...1994... You've searched all night already. Try again tomorrow. They're not my patients. Or else I'll remember them. They must've mistaken you for someone else. Don't think so much and go to sleep. You sleep first. Let's go to sleep. Ok. Why aren't you dead yet? You can't run away. Just die. Die. I know you can't run away. Die. Die together. Give my daughter back to me. Give my daughter back to me. Get out. I don't want to ever see you again. Jim, what are you looking for? Jim. Jim, what are you doing? Jim. Good morning. You're up early. You have dark circles round your eyes. Perhaps I didn't sleep well last night. What do you want to eat? Anything will do. Ham and eggs and coffee. Why not have some congee? You have high cholesterol. Ok. How are you? Are you feeling well? I am fine. How is your appetite? Very good. Do you have tinnitus? No. Miss, the doctor is not ready to see you. Excuse me, it's urgent. I need to see Dr Chan. Ms Wong, please see the patient out first. Ok. - Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. Thank you, nurse. Yan, what is it? It's not me. I'm fine. Relax, it's ok. I'm really fine. It's Jim. He was really weird last night. Weird? Not bad. You're getting better. Reduce his dosage to 25 mg. And one more sleeping accessment. What is it? Got another difficult case for me? Are you alright? I'm fine. If you're fine then Yan's not fine. What's wrong with her? She told me you wandered around the house at night. Messed everything up and tidied them up again. And you murmured. She looks happy. Do you want me to do a check up for her? I think it's better to ask your wife to talk to her. Ok. It's Jim who's not well. Are you seeing illusions again? He's not possessed. He looks like he's sleepwalking. My husband sleepwalks too. Walking all the way to the nightclubs in Macau. Men are like that. Don't be so sensitive or you'll scare him away. Believe me once. I always believe you. But you make it sound so real everytime. I've really recovered. Even if I believe you, my husband does not. He's just tidying the house. What is he saying? He looks like he is on drugs. 1982, Yue... Yan just called. She said Jim is sleep walking again. He was behaving strangely the last time I saw him. Perhaps the ghost following Yan is now onto Jim? Don't scare me. What if it's real? Let me have a look at him first. Where's Jim? He looks fine. Jim. We were just passing by and came up to see you. Jim! He can't hear you. Is he possessed by a ghost? That's crazy. Jim! Did he say or do anything before this? Did he hear any sound before he acts like this? How about when he wakes up? This alarm clock. Hey, you're here. You've been sleepwalking. What? I saw it. What are you saying? Yan recorded it for you. Take a look if you don't believe me. You show him the tape. 1982, Yue... Why did you record this? Who do you think you are? - Jim! - Shut up. You sleep first and we'll talk tomorrow. There's nothing to talk about. Don't you dare talk about this in the hospital. How many times have I told you not to touch my things? Tidy it up. Don't be afraid. Dean. What did he tell you? Jim, don't blame Wilson. He's just worried about you. I'm fine. No mental in-patient will admit he has a problem. You take me as a patient? You did ECT on yourself last time. I knew about it already the next day. Even some board members knew about it. Wilson was the one backing you up. You must know what your problem is. I think you can tell us. I think I'm under too much pressure. I can't finish my thesis. Then take a leave for the time being. Yes. I think I need a holiday. Good. But you were really sleepwalking. I saw the tape. I was taking too many depressants. I'm glad you can analyze it yourself. So it's settled then. Take a long holiday. When you come back, I'll give you an examination myself. Ok. - Out. - Jim! Get out. It's my problem. I guess I've been living alone for too long. And I feel uneasy living with someone else. I'm not trying to dominate you. But I can't see you in trouble and not say a word. I'm fine. They're your illusions. If you're such a great doctor, do a test on me now. I'm not a great doctor. I can't even cure you now. Because I'm telling the truth? How can you tell other doctors I have a problem? Do you know that can really hurt my reputation? Sorry. I didn't know what to do except to tell Wilson... Never mind. I don't want to upset you. Don't worry. I won't bother you. I'll refer you to another doctor. There's no need. You know very well I've recovered. Ok. I'll move out tomorrow. Why did you do that? Why did you have to be so cruel? Why are you still following me after death? I can't be with you. I really can't be with you. Please let me go. Leave me alone. Don't follow me. I will follow you till the end of your life. You can never escape from me. You can never escape from me. "Love, Yue" "Female highschool student committed suicide" You found them. What are you trying to find these few nights? Is she going to be alright? Don't worry. She'll be fine. Get Jim up here. Or else I'll jump. What happened? What happened? I was so certain I threw them all away. Why are they still here? Why can I suddenly remember everything? You don't have to remember. There's no need to remember the past. It's her. It's her. She won't let me go. She won't let me go. She makes me remember everything. Help me. Someone help me. I'll help you. Look at me. Look at me. Ghosts do not exist. Believe me. You finally forced me to come back here. I know what I have to do. You want me to jump? You want me to die. But I want to tell you something. I've never been happy all these years. I've never... I've never been able to accept another girl. Because of you. You've never been happy since you died. Why do I have the right to be happy? But I really want to forget you. I really want to forget you. If my death can satisfy you and make you happy... I will do it. You think if we're reunited by death we can forget the past? Some things that are broken cannot be mended. It's irrevocable. We will never forget. Never, never forget. Happy birthday. Thank you. One, two, three. For me? How's your hand? It's ok. You sure? Who is she? It's none of your business. Who is she? Are you crazy? Do you think I know nothing? I don't need you now. - Get lost. - What are you doing? Leave. Don't ever come back. Beautiful things can just disappear like that. What will you do if I die? I'll die with you. I won't let you say that. I won't let you be on your own. I'll be there with you. I won't let you. We've been happy together... and we've known pain. I'll remember them all. I won't forget them again like I did all these years. I'll die with you. I don't love you anymore. I don't need you now.
