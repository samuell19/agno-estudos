It's my birthday, Mom. It's my birthday again. I can't believe it. Know how old I am? That's the Old Fashioned, that's the Boulevardier. The guy ordered a Moscow Mule. Just add mint. No, really, you're doing well. You'll be fine in a month's time. I'm here So close to you Is it normal that she can sing? Is it normal that she can sing? You know she doesn't sing. You always do this on your birthday. Move on. She still has some memories, right? Get out. Come in. What have you already tried? Speed and coke. You have to pay first. Wait here. Remember the conditions? You told me to stay here. To look at me. Without moving. And not to call anyone. Whatever happens. It's weird. No more than wanting to communicate with a... A cabbage. Will it work? Yeah. It'll work. You'll reach another level of consciousness. And the cabbage... won't talk to you, but you'll be able to communicate with her. - She's not dead? - No. Bring that chair over here. Wait till I tell you. Stay there. Do nothing, just look at me. I'm looking. I don't feel a thing... I don't feel a thing. Get off! Get off me! Get off! Get off! She needs unplugging - now! Mommy is here Right next to you Under the sheets I'll count to three Mommy, where are you? I am here So close to you Mommy is here Right next to you Thanks. I don't know what happened. It doesn't matter. You won't talk? You won't talk to me? - And the beer? - Yeah, I need to work on it. Sure, but it comes over time. It's OK, you can... Don't you want me to walk you home? - No, I really need... - To sleep, OK. I'm hungry. There's some birthday cake left. You're 20, Inès. What does that mean? Make the most of your youth, your energy. You'll have plenty of time to be boring. Assert yourself, take your place. She wrote to me and said: "We're here at the same time, we gotta see each other," so I said: "We will." So we did. Where are you going? I signed the Pact. Stay free! Some people are having fun! - What're you doing? - What? - Your key. - I'm not drunk. But where's your key? I'm not drunk. Disappointed? Go to bed. You told me to experiment. Independence. Come on. Dad... Take me, Dad. At my father's. I don't know. I've never had one. She needs unplugging. She needs unplugging - now! There's oatmeal and fruit. Bye. Inès, hi there! I'm glad to meet you at last. Last time I saw her, she was tiny. - She's your aunt. - Yeah. I'm Claudelle's sister. The second one, that's me! Why did I say that? I'm your aunt. Did she know I existed? She's just like her mother. Julie wants to spend some time here. - No, Christian wants... - Here? Do you mind? Inès, you can speak your mind. Inès, I'm sorry, I... I don't want to be in the way. I'm sorry. Look, Inès, you're free to say what you think. If it bothers you, say what's on your mind. It's OK. "It's OK"? No. What do you think? You? Get involved, Inès. Go on, express yourself. Freedom, Inès, freedom. If you're not OK with your aunt staying, say so. Set out your arguments. Argument n° 1: I don't know her. It's true, she doesn't. Argument n° 2: I think it's strange she's back after all these years away. Without ever coming to see Claudelle. It is strange. You should explain. Or not. You're free. So, Inès? Will you eat with us? No, I'm going. Hey, girl. I'm awake. It's time to eat. I'm leaving. Leaving? Well, dinner's ready. - Where does this go? - In the kitchen. Dad - Kate. Nice... uh... to meet you. Fred... Taking the dog? I'm minding him. Up to you. What're you doing here? What're you doing here, big dog? You have a rug. Go on your rug, Fred. Go on your rug. Go on. Rug! Rug, big dog! Rug! Go on your rug. You shouldn't be on the bed. Go on the rug. Are you hungry? Careful, Fred. - I put something in your bag. - What is it? Juice. I need to sleep. It'll help you sleep, OK? Don't have a lot. It's nearly ready. Back already? Do you need money? I'll take a shower. I can't sleep, Dad. I want you to come home, Inès. I can't, Dad. I'm on the road to my life. Yes, come back, Inès. Inès? Are you OK? I'm coming in. Are you OK? You sure? Go home. I'm OK. Inès. Mathias. I just moved into the area. Well, a few weeks ago. I think we live near each other. I see you out at night. I mean, when I can't sleep. I work nights in a bar, so I'm a bit out of phase. Are you going out or are you coming back? I'm going out. I'm going home. I skipped work. I... Anyway... Where do you work? I make music. Do you play an instrument? No, I don't. I'm a singer. In a band. So, I... Want to stay with me? Do you... - Do you smoke? - Yes. - Inès? - Yes. You work in a bar? The Bar With No Name. Know it? Cool. Hi. - You OK? - Yeah. Going to play a show? No. I'm working tonight. Want to come? Yeah, OK. - It's... - The Bar With No Name. Yeah. Cool. - Later. - Bye. Fred... Just for tonight. It's good you bring glasses back, but the busboy can do it. Make sure people don't want more drinks. And take their orders, OK? You came! - You OK? - Yeah, you? - That looks good. - Thanks. Take your coat off. - Let's dance. - No. Just a bit. Can I have a word, Inès? Don't move. I'll be right back. It's challenge time! For the first time in town! Where are you? Where? I'm here. Do this. I'll jump. - You're so good. - Your aim was out. Close the door. Where are we? Who's that? Come here. Well, no. Come over here. Careful, not too close. Why? She might hit you. Who is she? My mother. Your mother? Yeah. What's wrong with her? Well... she's a cabbage. A cabbage? She can sing. Look. Where are you? Are you hiding? Are you there? So close to me Mommy is here Right next to you Under the sheets I'll count to three Can you see me? Can you hear me? Are you there? So close to me Mommy, where are you? I know you're there Under the sheets I'll count to three If you cut a worm in two, both pieces survive. It's the same with humans. If you remove the head, the body lives... That's life. She was beautiful. So, you take photos? I looked in your room. I shouldn't have. I'm going to quit the bar. That's up to you, Inès. Christian, she's asking for help. Pardon? She's asking for your help. None of your business. It is my business. Everyone always got along without you. Got along great... You looked after her so well! You all let her commit suicide. You decided it was a suicide attempt. Only you would think she accidentally took a huge dose of insulin. I don't think that. I really don't know. But suicide or not, it was her life, her choice. It was suicide? Answer me, Dad. I don't know, Inès. I was 10. You're all crazy! All crazy! You're all crazy! I'm free! Free! I'm free! Do you need help? No, thanks, I don't need help. You have nobody? No, I have nobody. I didn't take anything. You can't keep me. I'm free. EMERGENCY Not again, Fred! You should do that outside. That's not good! Bad dog! Are you here for money? It's the last time. I won't give you any, Inès. Your head's full of useless mathematics. You swim in front of a wall. Your life's pointless. Not very convincing arguments. I'd be better off without you. Well, you're 20 now. We'll be going our separate ways. - Hello. - Hi. Down, Fred. He's funny. He's called Fred. Give me that. - OK? - Yeah, you? Thanks. Wow! It's like a date. Come on. Want some wine? Yeah. My dad and I could spend ages sitting at the table... without speaking. I really didn't expect this. I thought you'd invited other people. No, it's OK. No, that's not happening. Your sofa wouldn't stand it. Go away. - I'm sorry... - Go away. I don't care. You just want to complicate things, dressing as a guy or a girl. Are you OK? We can just talk. Even stay in silence. I just don't need negative people in my life. I need it to be light and fun. And you're heavy, so... You lost the war Your life is just a fantasy For once You see yourself Cry for help Good dog. Hey, good dog. It's Fred. Wait, Fred. Go away, Fred. Come here. Come on. Wait... OK. He stabbed me. Don't you believe me? Will you let him leave? Calm down. Just calm down. No-one stabbed you. I don't feel good. Inès, calm down. No-one stabbed you. Relax. You don't exist... You don't exist. You don't exist! Are you OK? Can I help you? Yuck, that's disgusting, Fred! Dad... Fred, stop pissing on the floor! Stop it! Bad dog! Enough! Pull yourself together, Inès. Hi. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Why are you here? I'm here for work. You don't work here anymore. You missed your last 4 shifts. - It's over... - Don't touch me. I'm sorry. Fred! I'll get some water. Here, Fred. Drink, Fred. Why are you here? Call before coming here. What's going on? I'm tired, I worked all night. And my bag was stolen, along with my tips and phone. Let me in. You have to call first. Let me in, Inès. Help by giving me some money. You won't help me? Fine! Go away. I don't wanna see you! You just want me to kill myself. I know it's what you want. Well, I won't. Fred, I'll get you some water. Dad! Inès... Are you there? Hi. Inès, I brought you some food. Inès, open up. This is ridiculous. I brought you some stuff. That's for you. Cereal, bread, and eggs. And the stuff to help you sleep. - Thanks. - That's OK. I'll clean up. Fred sleeps the whole time. I can't come home, Dad. I'm on the road to my life. I'll come across it at last. Come across that life. And recognize it. They'll take you away, Inès. If you resist, they'll cuff you. - Take you to the hospital. - No. Yes. You have no choice, Inès. I have a court order. You've lost your freedom. I couldn't wait to get out. You big dog! Come here, you big doggy! I'm scared I'll relapse. Everything we know is fake. It's algebra, it's mathematics. That's bullshit! Why do you stay alive? For your job? For your students? For your books? For your friends? You don't have any. For the few dumb bitches you fucked in 10 years? I don't have an answer. For me...?
