Let's go COPY This is the China Air Force You're entering Chinese airspace Please indicate your nationality, ID and purpose of your flight Change course immediately I can't hear you I can't hear you Stop pretending you don't understand Save it, words are no use how about this His English is getting a little better, isn't it? Maybe he got himself a tutor. Continue surveillance. Hey these guys can stick with us til the day I learn Chinese. Watch out! Avert! You're just asking for it! Keep on him. Where is the other guy? You're entering Chinese Air Space - Change course, change course - Son of a bitch Looks like someone's gonna be learning Chinese. What? You like this guy now? He is kind of cute. Cuter than you. Your maneuvers reminded me of a movie. Shut up. We're Chinese Air Force. Sky Hunter, this is Red Shore. Mission complete. Return to base Two unidentified aircraft approaching at high speed from your 2 0-clock. Stay alert What do they want? Unfriendless. Be ready. Bandits 12 o'clock, 2 miles co-altitude, cold Let's show force They've locked on. Evading! They've gone too far. Teach them a lesson. Got it. Blind Blind. Keep radar tracking. I saw it, here it is, there's only one plane. See you in the next life! Shit, 6 o'clock, chaff flares, chaff flares! Drop fuel tanks, drop fuel tanks, it's not fun anymore, let's get out of here. Leaving so soon? How about that! Anything just to feel alive! Be rude not to give some back. All done! South-east entrance in 25 meters Control room, north-east corner. You'll have to go the long way around But I just go through this window and straight on to the target because I can fly. Just open the door! Are you done? Don't rush me. I don't mean to, but someone's coming. Stall him. Huh? How can I stall him? Ooh! Shit. It's too late. If your number's up, it's up. See you in the next life! Oh man! Are you OK? Ha ha, sorry pal. Kill the alarm! Get me outta here. Exit trough Go that way. There's nobody there. Did a dog eat your brains? You said there was no one there! I meant no human! Our mission was to get the enemy's information. They didn't say to bring back a pet! The last rescue mission didn't get everyone clear We think they're trapped in the building. Another landslide could take the building at anytime. Its extremely dangerous The Wind's too strong I'm not sure this bird can take it. Hold on Watch out for the... Please! Help! Found them. We're down here! Command center, come in How long until the landslide hits? Rain getting heavier upstream, means you've probably got about 5 minutes. Yali, the stairs have collapsed We don't have the conditions for landing There's no time. Hover here. Prepare for rescue. Rescue has priority, but your safety's important too There's no telling what might happen If there's a sudden change you're life could be at risk Worse than my Morn. Where are you? Call out to me We're in here Please help us In here In here, in here The door is stuck and we can't get out. It still won't budge Stay calm, take care of the kid Stand back Yali, what's going on? The landslide's almost on you Hurry. OK, the kid first Careful now Hold on tight The hillside's crumbling, that building's gonna go soon Bring her down We're coming out COPY Faster, faster, faster Now! I've flown for 30 years I used to be where you are Below the podium Witnessing a former generation's heroes farewell the blue skies, with great honor But I never let myself think of when my day would come The sky is always for new fighters New pilots to be trained up and sent up It's time to pass these blue skies into your ready hands. But it's hard to say goodbye, Because the life stories of my generation are written in these skies Every flight path we left up there testifies our devotion to protecting of our country's air space Even these last few days - Your goddess. - as I laid in bed at home, - Cut it out! - I kept listening to the radio transmissions It was quite impressive. How he got from their 9 to their 6 before they even knew what happened. Am I awesome? Yes, Sir! How about you? Are you awesome too? Yes, Sir! That's right. You're even better than me. Every time I look at you I am honestly astounded not only because of your courage, your skill, actions and thought but because the blood that beats in your veins beats in time with this new era yours is new blood fit for a new generation of fighter planes And because you are better more perfect and used to succeeding there is something that I must tell you all today You all need to be prepared not only to meet with victory but also to face your failures This is the true greatness of a soldier You must learn to treat the skies with reverence This is the only way can you shoulder the responsibility. All rise! Salute. At ease. Sit. My dear wife, Thank you for all your understanding and support all these years In my heart, you Will always be my true blue sky Three, two, one, cheese. Another, another, get us in too Is it a selfie? Voice-activated. OK. Right, ready? 3, 2... Mr. Lu's handsome, yeah? Yeah! OK, come here. Have a look. Yali How is it? Show me How's it look? Very nice! Mr Lu looks great Why didn't you smile, Mr Lu? I smiled That's a good one I think Yali's even better looking than she was at flight school What's it to you, anyway? You'd better send me that photo Who needs photos when she's right here? Stop kidding, I'm being serious I even think Maybe Yali has a crush on you I'm going left, pulling up Can you tell me where the world full of flowers is? If it's a real place then I will find a way to get there. I have never given up on what I believe Even when days were full of melancholy Stop staring This is the best chance you've ever had Why do I feel like you're a total imbecile? Only you can determine your fate! Fate will never leave us grovelling for mercy We'll embrace through the blood, sweat and tears No compromise through the years Have some more. There's a fruit tart. These two pieces of cake are enough for me I'm right behind you - I'll just grab these two - OK, I'll wait over there Though time goes by We'll never part Can't believe, after so many years You're still looking as great as ever As I listened to you sing that song It was like my 18 year old self was brought back to life You know, it's like once you've been through the struggles as comrades in arms no matter how much time passes that sense of affection it never really changes You are... Wu Di. Who Di? Wu Di, we were classmates. In Mr. Lu's class. I don't remember Yali, come on now! You sang the same song at our graduation ceremony You wore a red dress Yeah And someone smeared cake on your face? Who did that? Me! Damn right it was you! Hey, you there! Is that you, Yali? Keep it UP How have you been, bro? Long time no see. Yaâ€œ. I thought I taught you everything Yet you still don't remember not to offend women, did you? Mr. Lu. You wanted to fly overseas, its been approved It's good pay, don't spend it all Do drop by before you leave My wife wants a proper send-off For sure. I'll drop by Mr. Lu, what are you going to do? There's many ways to fly UAV's are also aircraft, right? Can't wipe it off, hey? When did you make this decision? A while ago. I wasn't sure it'd go through, so I didn't tell you. Flying overseas You didn't even run it by me? It's not like you're my guardian I'm... Then what am I to you? You're like my brother have been since we graduated from flight school. But I've thought this through I want a different kind of life You can find another wingman. Not just anyone can be my wingman We've always been the best of thenpilots If you give up now, you'll regret it The best, there can only be one It's you. This again. All dynamic duos have a hero and a sidekick One of them has to pay the price Just like you and Yali. All these years both of you so proud you never managed to get together That isn't even the same thing! If you are my brother, you'll respect my decisions Hey, What's with you two? We're leaving. We'd better get moving. Let's go. Not me. It's your time. Sky Hunter is our airforce's covert unit. We exist to hone airforce combat-readiness We represent the airforce elite Those we have defeated gave us a name Battlefield Grindstone Joining Sky Hunter requires you to pay a price.

You can still change your mind, just turn around now and leave Smoke and mirrors All of you were handpicked by me from the airforce's elite I have brought you all together here to undergo my personal stringent selection Personally, I'm your biggest fan I love seeing your faces full of such confidence your pride that you think you're all that Now I look forward to seeing what you're made of This might be the only pleasure I derive, in this wilderness lam the head of Sky Hunter Special Brigade My name Ling Weifeng. Look at this place! It's made to withstand a third world war! It's 3 kilometers walk to the valley You are now entering a top secret military facility If you're not up to the task, go no further Remember, this place doesn't exist. Your ID Hey, that photo there, can I take it with me? Yes. You can't take your phone or wallet with you That, you may as well leave behind For sure won't be needing it This was assigned to me by my troop What troop are you from? So considerate. Field Troop issue for emergency use For water storage and sand-proofing I know that. Books are the stairway to enlightenment Ebooks are like an elevator Not allowed Anything else? No. What is this? Cold medicine. Do you want to keep this picture too? Helicopter pilot Zhao Yali. Air Force Sergeant Ba Tu Air Force Sergeant Gao Yuan from the Thunder Commandos Wu Di Winner of both Golden Helmet and Golden Dart Qinghua Degree in Data Security and Automation Good with guns, combat, and explosives Unfamiliar terrain and complex weather conditions are no problem Sky Hunter needs a tech-savvy and multitalented person like myself I'm confident I'll pass and be a Sky Hunter I've come here to become the best pilot I can be. I can handle all kinds of weather proficient in 3 types of jets. I have been awarded... You pulled off an expulsion mission out at sea a few days ago, right? As far as I'm concerned, that was a piece of cake. Not even worth mentioning After all, at the time... Alright Even though I don't know what I'm doing here I just want to say every second spent on the ground I consider a waste of my time. Tell me when can I get in a plane? Right now. I've got this I can do it, I can Ling Weifeng. F... This is training for survival You're a pilot, downed behind enemy lines You need to get to the assigned rendezvous point There'll be a rescue squad waiting for you. Turn on your Beidou Navigation and Positioning System when needed Only your rescue team will be able to see your location Up until then, you'd better make sure you're not captured by the pursuing enemy. Rescue One. Rescue One. Do you copy? Do you copy. Reading you loud and clear My current position is S1H45 After the pilot reaches the ground they should maintain radio silence until reaching the planned time and location to avoid discovery by the enemy This is a perfect example of how to fail It seems this guy can disappear But it shows the signal at this location Here's the signal source we've been tracking So sneaky They still managed to find me Based on Wu Di's landing position the rate at which he's moving and my calculations of the terrain the rescue team should pick him up here Why the random running? Cap'n Ling Wu Di'd be dead by now if it was the real battlefield, right? I thought the Golden Helmet was a real big deal. He lost it in such a short time Crazy He's up to something That'll do it. Rescue Two continue on to the planned rescue point. I have a new location Show me Wu Di's Beidou signal trajectory Yes, sir. Zoom in. A bit more. What is he doing He was writing with his navigator Nanshan south I'm here. I'm the man! Buddy You're quite the runner Running Man? I count three mistakes you made One You threw away all your comms devices Two You left behind a trail made with your own footprints Three See for yourself The command center sent us this Using your nav to send a location Props for thinking of that Your guys are cheaters! Need eyes in the back of your head Welcome to Sky Hunter. Surrender Yali, that was perfect Emergency rescue code states until your identity is confirmed you must be treated as hostile Nice Admit it, you want to be taken too. With fresh air and sunshine like this This assignment is turning out to be like heaven on earth for me. And I gotta tell ya You and Ya Li had better start picking up the pace Don't let me beat you to it Cause I plan on being surrounded by a brood of mixed-blood kids soon. In short, Don't be too envious Don't be jealous of me and don't miss me too much. You need to focus on you and Yali... Just a minute This is war! Hi. Can anyone see me? Are you the friend Uncle Haochen talks about? 510p Duoduo. Xiaoqing. - Are you making mischief again? - Come on. Run for it. I'll cover you. Run faster. Not brute force This takes smarts Yaâ€œ, catching you is really hard But you did catch me in the end Why did you join the Sky Hunters Because I want to become a better pilot And why else? Haochen, You were a fool To miss out on coming here! But no, there's another reason Another thing It's fine Forget it. Come on. Get up here! Flying. Flying. My comrade named this tatic the marsh mellow tatic. Now, I must not forget my comrade. He is my best friend. And he knows me better than my girlfriend, even though I don't have a girlfriend yet. By the way, he is my wingman. Then I think to be a great fighter pilot, you must have a equally great relationship with your wingman. Class is over. Good luck. Your class is very exciting. You are not only a good pilot also a good teacher. I have had a lot of flying experience, so I know a lot. But I still don't understand one point. Which point? The trainees said you used to be a great fighter pilot and you don't understand such a simple tatic. I just don't understand when enemy found you and seized you at an excellent position at 6 o'clock, why would they allow you to hide in the clouds? Your country haven't been into a war for decades now. What if we start a war tomorrow? Are you guys even ready? I just assumed a situation. I don't mean to get trouble. See you the next day. Steady. Steady Go Go Go! Get 'em on the right They're getting away, shoot them - In here, in here - Get me a perimeter - Help me. - Get In the car. - Move, move, move, move - Hurry up!

Hunter Mission failure, return to base Mission is incomplete, requesting second pass Mission complete, returning now. A good result With that time he almost beat your record Almost Means he still needs some work then You see that? Still full of himself. Sir, sir! The terrorist organization Light Group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. What's the situation of the Chinese staff located at the airport? Don't know sir. Still missing. Then how will I explain it to the general? We don't know. They've probably been kidnapped Probably, probably, damn it! Then your military career could also be over. You got that? You'd better come up with a good answer for the General General. ...helicopter during a routine en route has been shot down, casualties unknown Government forces admitted that the air strike against occupation forces at the Hara airport to be a major failure Government forces have officially escalated the situation to a Level One Terrorist attack, Prior to this, the government has already... I've heard enough tragedy today. I hope you're bringing me good news. General, some Chinese staff stationed at the airport were kidnapped earlier today. They are still missing and out of touch at the moment. I have to warn you, general. This is the last call of us. You have 36 hours to release our leader before I fulfill my promise. I'm warning you, too. This is no joke. Even if you control the missile silo, you do not have the technical ability to launch that monster. You better act before its too late My granny told me when the Goddess of Mount Chess cries, it's the time of our nation to decline. Contact the Chinese government immediately. Everything is ready. I am Gorula Rachman responsible for the airport military base. As a professional soldier, I hereby confirm that they still have the launch authorization and encrypted key to a long-range ballistic missile, which can likely reach an area within a radius of 1500km. Do not approach... The hostages are kept near the silo. A total of 37 people have gone missing A total of 9 Chinese, 2 of whom are kids We believe they are all in the hands of the terrorists The priest they have demanded be released is leader of the terrorist group Holy Light. He masterminded several large-scale terrorist attacks and was captured in Mahbu just four months ago. Now the Mahbu airforce base has been confirmed as controlled by the terrorists Mahbu has officially requested our assistance Two Chinese jet fighters will take back control of the air and assist their ground forces in launching a rescue effort. Give terrorists an inch and they'll take a mile Our superiors have made it clear its to be a joint anti-terror operation Who's my wingman on this mission? According to current statistics, Wu Di is your best choice Based on the capacity graphs for pilots on this base Wu Di's stats are clearly ahead of the other pilots But I would not suggest choosing him for this mission because Wu Di's former wingman is one of the terrorists' hostages and our mission orders are just to assist, not to rescue I'm afraid his emotions may cause erratic behavior Who is the pilot on duty right now? It's me. No-one else? I want to take part in this mission I'm a professional Soldiers don't allow emotions to interfere with a mission Thunder ready to go Hunter ready to go You're good to go Thunder, Hunter, tactical formation Copy that. How long have you known Haochen? I am asking you. We've been together since we were in the aviation school. He's always been your wingman, right? Yep, before I joined Sky Hunter. I've read the report of your expelling mission on the sea. He's smart. Don't worry. It would be OK. The course chosen by Captain Ling is completely consistent with the plan preferred by the computer, and it's even more effective. Thunder. This is UAV reporting. An air defence radars searching right in front of you. It might be supportive, Don't rule out other possibilities. Lower the altitude and pay a close attention on it. Copy that. Pay attention to the radar. Position 225 degrees. It's not in the report and its power-on time is very strange. Do you think theres any problem? The system of Mabul has always been on the brink of breaking down. Why is it activated now? Rahman, I made it! Now it's time to show them They'll release my older brother at once. We are surrounded by the military. Two Chinese fighters are coming in fast. Take them down. Yes, sir. Guys, we'll use all of the machines... go, go, go The Guidance radar on the ground is initiated. Sam missiles are launched. Scatter and dodge. Roger that. Descending altitude increases speed Chaff flares! Pull up for a 30 degrees recovery. They are too close to get rid of. Do a crossover That maneuver you used at your graduation ceremony Copy that. I fly to the left What are you gonna do? Shut up. Just follow my instruction. Take a reverse maneuver. The missile is right behind you. Thunder. Let's go. Hundredth Hundredth Sky Hunter, mission canceled. Return immediately. Evaluate the damage condition. Hundredth Can you operate the plane? I can't see clearly. I can see nothing. Hundredth It seems that your canopy, left and right elevator, The left end of the rudder are damaged. Copy that. Hundredth If you can't make it, you can parachute. I've been a pilot for years. Have you ever seen me parachuting? And besides, it's beyond Chinese territory. I've know the damages. Ready for return.

What do you want to do? Shut up. Listen to me. Your incompetence embarrassed the President No matter how you do it. You must guarantee the safety of the Chinese hostages. The Chinese government will take action. Are we gonna leave here alive? Don't worry. They dare not do anything to us. We'll be saved. Trust me shut up He needs a doctor. You'd better eat something. You have a long way to run because you have to send a message to the Chinese government for us. To be honest, you impressed me. If you have something to say, tell it to me straightly. Tell me, how you felt facing death for the first time? Especially after you killed someone. Isn't it fascinating? No! It's disgusting. It makes me realize that the soldier is the guard of peace. It seems you are a qualified soldier as I am. You betrayed your country and your people. How dare you talk about what a qualified soldier does. You are from a powerful and peaceful country. You have never been to a war or experienced humiliation and hurt. You are like a spoiled child enjoying all the love while spreading compassion to the people suffering in the world. I didn't betray my people. But my government betrayed me. It's time for you to go. Your country's made the wrong decision. Since you are a Chinese soldier, you should take all the responsibility. We officially warn the Chinese government. If you dare to intervene with our action again, this will be the end of the Chinese hostages. Wait! We made it. We made it. You are a lucky boy. Yet we meet again. You'd better keep your promise. I smell freedom. Hey convict. You killed my wife and unborn child. You abominating piece of shit. You deserve this. No! Get down, down! He tried to b... I'm gonna kill every... You need medical right here. Can anyone see me? Are you the friend Uncle Haochen talks about? There is nothing here. There's nothing good to eat No good games to play not even cartoons to watch You don't want to come here 2 hours 45 minutes ago, a Chinese fighter jet involved in a joint anti-terrorist mission came under attack one of the pilots injured and a fighter damaged Our intelligence reports have confirmed the Mahbu military has lost control of some of its military facilities. At this point, 5 hours after the incident we are approaching the deadline set by the terrorists Because the group's leader was killed the terrorists are sure to launch ballistic missiles, and kill hostages. A fifteen hundred kilometer radius of Asia, including Western China will be vulnerable to ballistic strike So we must, with all haste, attempt our own rescue operation It must be sudden and precise Its essential that we free the hostages without alerting the terrorists The problem we are currently facing is the two surveillance radars near the Chess mountains effectively block almost all the possible flight paths And the SAM missiles used in the attack on our planes have been moved and concealed We have a powerful backup force and support system The key will be in how to suppress the enemy's guided missiles so our jets can make their incursion According to surveillance the terrorists have no blind spot radar coverage in the valley, so there is a 10-second scan vacancy between the two radars. During this 10-second window our fighters will need to fly through a narrow 20 meter valley no higher than 30 meters off the ground Since the valley is broken up by several ridges our pilots must traverse two mountain crests avoiding detection by their SAM radars crossing the Chess Mountains It's an extremely difficult low-altitude flight Worse, it's a night flight Any error, we lose both plane and pilot and the whole mission is forfeit Today, when I was evading their missiles, I noticed that though the SAM guidance radar reacts quickly, the array's sidelobe level is too high. Our latest anti-radiation missile can capture the weak signal behind the antenna. I can fly out just after dawn go through the Chess mountains at low altitude to the missile silo As soon as I pull up, and the guidance radar has got a lock on me my wingman can get in the blind spot behind their antenna and take out their radar so that SAM would be useless. Then I can destroy the missile silo with a bomb Mahbu made a mess of the handover of their leader The death of their leader Means we don't have the time to wait for daylight Then I will fly at night. Air Bus 500 in the air, heading for the target Assignments from command Ground combat team will be led by Batu and Gaoyuan Zhao Yali is hands down the obvious choice for the Helicopter Rescue Squad Zhang Li will take the wingman position for this flight And the leading pilot... Wu Di Do we have a problem? I worry he is not recovered from his previous mission A hero wears his scars with honor The mission takes precedence If he is a true pilot we have no problem I know now lam not the most outstanding pilot But I am the person most suited to carry out this task Because I've flown there before My knowledge of the conditions will help our mission I'm not making promises Because when a person makes a promise they don't understand what they have committed to Our people are undergoing suffering If we cannot fight for our own people then who can we fight for? Today, it's my honor to stand here and look upon the soldiers of Sky Hunter base. Everyone of you was selected from our airforce's most elite teams, pilots, paratroopers, radarmen. But even more important than titles you're spirited highly skilled courageous virtuous Chinese soldiers have yet to experience war's baptism of fire have yet to experience war's baptism of fire I can already see it in your eyes determination to win with courage You are about to set out to rescue your brothers To a soldier, this is not only a duty but an honor Go and defeat them They need to understand offending us was their stupidest decision My comrades my children Please look after those who battle beside you It is my hope that you'll all return safely Yaâ€œ, We're heading out in 10 minutes HEY The weather broadcast says There'll be turbulence in the mountains tonight When making the pass... be careful I Will be The guidance radar will lock on in a few seconds. So you must be prepared with your evasive maneuvers I Will be Of course. You've flown there before. You know it all by now Don't worry I'm gonna make it back My boy Its up to you Air Bus 500 has reached the target location On this rescue mission our actions need to be clean and agile collateral damage minimised international sovereignty respected unless we come under direct attack or the mission requires, we are not to attack Mahbu's facilities nor should their citizens be harmed Apart from bullets fired all personnel and equipment must be brought back with you Storm Cloud ready to go Hunter ready to go Entering target zone in 1 minute This is the real deal.
