OK, Hailey, Nurse Annie's gonna take your pulse and vitals and make sure everything's OK. And pretty soon, you'll be better than ever. But first, there's a really important matter we ought to address... Sweet or sour? Both! Ah! Both it is. Here you go. Thank you, Dr. Natalie. You are going to make a great doctor one day but a terrible dentist. What's wrong? Residency deadlines are coming up soon and I'm still undecided. You're worried? No. Not really. I mean, I have worrying penciled in for tomorrow. Just promise you won't overthink it. 9 out of 10 doctors say the 10th one should mellow out. Just follow your heart. 'Cause you're thinking cardiology? Whatever you decide, we'll be lucky to have you. Special delivery. Bless you. Mm. Yeah. Extra cream, no sugar, and scorching hot, just like you. Hmm, getting creative with the compliments, huh? Not at work. People will gossip. Let them talk. I don't care who knows it. I love you, Natalie... Ssh. I love you, too. The kisses are gonna have to wait. Well, speaking of later, how about dinner tonight? Hmm? Can we maybe postpone? Aah! You're still agonizing over the residency deadlines? Well, define agonizing. You can laugh because you've already sent in your application. True, and I should be hearing something any time, but until then, I still got to eat. So, dinner? - OK. - Yes! And you can show me your list of pros and cons because I know you have it written out. No, not me. Really? Last time we had a long weekend, you had a whole spreadsheet and gave everyone a personal color scheme. OK, fine. There may be a list. There's the Natalie I know of. Hey! You stole that one. See you later. Hey, Doc, you got it bad. What if she leaves, Annie? I mean, what if she gets a great residency across the country, I'll never see her again. You guys will figure it out, whatever that is. Incoming. Thank you. - Sorry, I'm late. - Aah! There she is. Hey, no apologies. You're here now and that's what matters. Hey, Scott told your dad about you catching that lead today. Scott called you? You know Scott. He's proud of you. We all are. You missed dinner. Mom made her famous meatloaf. Oh, sorry I missed that. Ooh! - I can heat some up for you. - Oh, no. It's fine. I just mean, I actually have plans with Scott so I'm not staying. Oh. Has he heard about his residency? Oh, not yet. But you know, in true Scott fashion, he's not worried. I gotta go. I've got homework. Uh, you should talk to her. Is everything OK? Yeah. It's just... she was looking forward to tonight. She misses you. I really meant to be here sooner. Sorry. I know, sweetheart. Just go talk it out. Hey. Hi. Do you have some clothes I could borrow for my date tonight. All I have are my scrubs. Hmm, mm. Oh, too blue. That's your favorite color. You have really great taste. I know you're all grown up now but to me, it seems like you were turning 10 just yesterday. Ah, you always say that. I'm almost 18. How's Cameron. We broke up. What? When? About three months ago. Abby, why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I don't want to bother you. You're busy with school and everything. You can always talk to me. Even if I don't have a solution, I can at least admire the problem from afar. Talk to me. I'm just worried that I'm never gonna have a relationship like you and Scott. OK, I didn't meet Scott until medical school so give it a few years before you declare yourself a spinster. I just want what you guys have. Do you think he'll propose? Ooh, no, no. Not now. No, we still have a lot to figure out before we talk about marriage. But you love him. I really do. Like, everything about him. Which is crazy considering how opposite we are. He can't hide one single emotion, and he jumps in with both feet while I'm still like dipping my toe. The emotion thing gets him into trouble, but it's also very charming. And he's always late, like he is now. He really is the yin to your yang. Oh. This is the one. Ooh. Fancy. Mm. Oh, you know I'm the president of the premed club at school? Of course. Well on Friday, we're having a career fair kind of thing. I was wondering if you could come in and talk to some of the students? Just answer questions about medical school and stuff like that? I'd love to, Abby, but I can't Friday. I have rotations. Semester is almost over and pretty soon, I'll have a lot of free time. So next career fair, I'll be there. I promise. It's OK. I understand. Mm. Ah, smell that? Next batch is done. How do you know? The timer hasn't even gone off. Hahaha. I don't need a timer. The nose knows. OK, Doctor Seuss, my nose has no idea when I'm supposed to take cookies out of the oven. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Don't you dare. Did somebody say cookies? - Hey! - Hey. Great to see you, pal. Good to see you, sir. Hi, you're late. Mm, you sure about that? Because I think I'm right... -on time. Mm, cookies are amazing, Janine. Well, you can eat as many as you want. Oh, I will. Mwah. Hey, kiddo. Hey, oh. Ah, one more thing. Mm? You have shared this recipe with Natalie, right? Uh, yes. Well, she's been helping me since she was a little girl, so... I can hear you. I think we're gonna get outta here. Ah. - Bye. - Have a good night. - See you later. - I love you, too. Thank you, sir. Have a great night, guys. Well, I don't understand how he does that and baking. Yeah, those cookies, the death of me. Are you even hungry for food right now? Ah, you know me. I do know you. Sorry, I'm... my mind's racing. I had no idea that applying for residency's could be this hard. Maybe it's good not to have a plan for once and just let things happen. Mm. Forget about the deadline, stress, and look inside. We should find out right now. Mm? I love working with children. I really like geriatrics, too. And? It just feels really good to help people. What about surgery? I love that rotation but I want more patient interaction. See, that's what I love about you, Natalie. You just wanna help people and you're so good at it, too. I know you're worried about the future but I'm not. You're so smart and so passionate and so beautiful... - and I can't imagine my life without you. Oh... no... Natalie... no. I love you so much. I think you love me, too. I do, Scott. See, that's perfect. Oh, Scott, why'd you just... Hold on, hold on. Just let me do this. Natalie Sims, will you marry me? I can't. I'm sorry, what? I can't. There's too much uncertainty... You... right now, we... -can't? Can't even begin to think about marriage. I... I thought we wanted the same thing? - We do. - So... I mean, I do... I do... I don't... I don't. Aah! I don't know. What I'm... Uh... -so, you won't marry me? No. Scott, I... I love you, but I... But you said no. Can we just go back to five minutes ago before any of this ever happened and have... I, uh... - a conversation or... or... Or... uh, this is the first time we even talked about it. I gotta go. Scott, wait. We can talk about this. I've... I gotta go. Congratulations, you guys. It's about time! Do you mind if I talk to Natalie? Sure. I'll leave you guys alone for a bit. I told her I was thinking of prop... Well, you know. Don't worry, she's the one I told, uh... Do you mind if I, uh, talk to you about something? Yeah, I think we should talk. Somewhere private? I got a call today from the residency in Chicago. They wanna fly me out to meet the team. If I go, it will be a three-year contract minimum. Wow! Scott, that's an incredible opportunity. Congratulations. Chicago, that's far. Yeah I was gonna decline when my circumstances changed. So... Our flight leaves tomorrow. Scott, wait. Well, honey, uh... Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Come on. Come on. I just didn't know who else to talk to, Mimi. I'm scared to tell Mom and Dad because they love Scott. Well, honey, they love you, too. I know, but... Hey, it's going to be fine. Talk to me. How can I ask him to stay when I've already told him no? Do you want him to stay? - I don't want him to go. - Uh-huh. And do you love him? Yes! Now, but you don't wanna marry him? - No. - No. No, I don't... I don't know. Things just aren't going at the way that I planned. Well, they never do. That's life. I mean, I don't even know what I'm doing. I feel like everything is just falling apart. You know, I'm facing the biggest decision of my life and he just goes and proposes like that? I mean, what was he thinking? Well, I... uh, well, what do you think, Natalie? What do you want? I don't know. That's the problem. I just wish that I knew how this was supposed to go. Ah, yeah. Uncertainty, it's very uncomfortable, honey. But, honey, I... I think I know something that might help. I don't want any more bons. No, not bonbons. But you're going to think I'm crazy. Watch your step, honey. Come on. Where... here it is. Is that yours? Mm-hmm. It's beautiful. Yeah. Before I married your grandpa, I was so nervous I almost didn't make it down the aisle. You were nervous? I would have never thought that watching you two growing up. Well, marrying him was the best decision I ever made. But there was a time when I wasn't so sure he was the one, or that I was ready to be anybody's wife. You know, I was 22 and my whole future was in front of me, and I just... there was so much pressure. Well, you said yes. What helped you decide? This veil. I know it sounds silly, but when I tried this veil on, I just... I just had this feeling that I could see my whole future unfold in front of me and I... I liked what I saw. And after that, I was sure. Try it on. Mimi, I don't see how trying on a wedding veil is gonna fix my problems with Scott. Oh, honey, I don't know, but there's just something about this whole veil. It just seems to make things more clear. So humor me. Come on, try it on. You look so beautiful. How does it feel? I feel silly. Tsk, Natalie, for once, don't think. Just feel. I won't tell anyone. Oh, Mimi. Mm. Mimi? Mimi? Hey. Ooh, I love that scarf. It reminds me of our honeymoon. Mm. Uh, honey... Traffic jam! Daddy, I thought we could make pancakes for snack time. Pancakes! Pancakes! All right, what do you want in your pancakes? - Chocolate chips! - Chocolate Chips? - Chocolate chips! - Or blueberries? - Yeah, strawberry. - All right. All right, will you take your car and you take you car, so Mommy and I won't... -slip anymore. Honey? Hey. Scott. Oh, it's the weirdest dream. We're at this house and there are these two kids. Something very strange is going on. Oh, you're right about that. I'm calling Dr. Hammond, getting you in right away. Oh, I'm fine. I'm... I'm just, um... I'm just overwhelmed or... or something. Mommy, say, ah. Oh. Silly Mommy. Where's Grandma Mimi? Is Grandma Mimi coming over? What, she's not here? No. She's probably at home. Which is? What? Home, where is that? Grandma Mimi moved, Mommy. This... this... This can't be real. I... - Oh. Oh, uh... - I'm... Oh, oh, easy. You hit your head pretty hard there. I really think we should go to the clinic. No, I'm just... I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm not feeling very well. Hey, I understand. You've been going at it nonstop. Just... did you eat anything today? Ah... You probably have low blood sugar. I just need to lie down. Yep. Yeah. Your mom is coming over. I can call her to cancel if you want. No, I wanna see her. I... I need to. Uh, power nap, I guess what I need. Ooh. Uh, I'm sorry. Is Mom having another baby? What? Well, what makes you say that, goober? Because the last time she was like this is when she had Dylan. Remember, you called it baby brain? Oh, I don't think so. Can I get a baby sister this time? No, that, um, mm-mm, there's... That's... sorry, um... Emma. Everybody, be good. Hello? Annie? You are not gonna believe what I'm about to tell you, but I had... NURSE ANNIE: Who is this... - and how do you have my cell phone? It's Natalie. Natalie Sims. No. Yes. Natalie Sims, fourth year medical student dating Scott. Natalie? I haven't heard from you in over 10 years, at least. 10 years... wh... OK, we spoke this morning. And what do you mean, dating Scott? I was at your wedding. Is everything all right? I don't know. Uh, I'm really confused, Annie. Something happened. Look, I'm really happy to hear from you, but if you're having a medical emergency, I suggest you hang up and dial 911. Ah! Hello? OK. Think. I am not crazy. What was the last thing I did? Retrace your steps. The veil. The veil! OK. Where is this thing? Bingo. All righty. Let's try this again. Ugh! Oh, good. You got Mimi's veil. Oh, my sweet girl. What's wrong? I'm so happy to see you but you're not gonna believe what is happening. Oh, well try me. OK, this is gonna sound crazy, but I don't know how I got here. I mean, one minute, this attic was still Grandma Mimi's house and she was insisting that I try on this veil. And the next thing I know, I wake up and I have two kids and a husband. Oh, my gosh. I sound crazy. No. Not exactly. Oh, so you know? Of course I know. Oh, time flies. We're all feeling sentimental right now. One moment, you're holding little baby in your arms, and the next minute, they're raising babies of their own or getting married. It can seem so unfair sometimes how quickly life goes by. But every chapter is beautiful and just keeps getting better and better. I miss you. Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry that I'm not around more. What do you mean? I see you almost everyday. You do? Are you feeling OK, Natalie? Look, uh, Scott said you... You hit your head. He thought it was OK but maybe you should take it easy. No, I just need to see Mimi. Well, you're going to see her at the dress fitting. What dress fitting? Now you're just trying to scare me. I don't know why you girls think that's so funny. One of these days, you're gonna be saying something serious, I'm just gonna think it's a joke. Come on, we're gonna be late. We don't wanna stress out your sister even more. And I... I think she likes this drop. We might consider this for her. I know. I guess there's something we could put, um, some fruit or raspberries or strawberries inside. Yeah. To the mother and sister of the bride, you're doing all the work. Mm. Ah. Oh! Abby! Oh my goodness, not again. You promised no more tears. Oh. I know, I'm so grown up. It just feels a little unreal. So did you bring it? Did I bring what? Grandma Mimi's veil? We're supposed to see the full look today, right? Uh, I forgot. I'm sorry. No, no. I've... I just had it. I forgot it, that's all. I... no, no, no, it's in perfectly good working condition. Was that a concern? No. No. Of course, I didn't... Hey, it's fine, honey. You're so beautiful. And everything is going to be just fine. Sorry. The stress is starting to get to me. But it's OK. Mistakes happen and you've done so much for me, Natalie. I have? OK, if you're gonna make me say it, you're the best sister in the world? There, you happy? Whew! So, do you like what you see? So I haven't completely lost my mind. No, honey. I'm telling you, it is the veil. Sometimes, it just helps to have a little clarity. Why did it bring me here? Well, you can't go back until all is revealed. So far, the only thing that's been revealed to me is two kids running around in a house calling me Mommy and a very concerned and confused Scott. And... is that what I'm supposed to see? I suppose. You'll know when you know. OK. I have residency deadlines. What if I get stuck here forever? You must trust the journey. Hey. Hey. So how was your day? Um, surreal but good. Well, I know things have been stressful with wedding planning, and the kids, and work, so I figured we go to our old medical school refuge. What, is this because I fainted? Because Scott, I'm... I'm fine, really. As your doctor, Doctor, I'm prescribing you a night off. Come on. This place hasn't changed a bit. You can always count on it. Let me guess, you ordered the BLT? You're getting the chicken sandwich. Can always count on it. Do you remember? Our first date was here, too. What? that was our first date? Well, technically. I, uh, I would really like to study with you sometime. I tend to learn better in groups. Mm. I think I was just a little smoother than that. Um, I think you... I think... no, you asked me over a CPR dummy. Oh, boy. Can we please tell the kids my version? I'll give you a do over. Hi, I'm Natalie. I'm so glad that you asked me to study. You are incredibly good with a stethoscope. Oh, why, thank you. And I want you to know the study session is purely intellectual. So what do you like to do for fun these days, Scott? Oh, there's a date night, family movie night, dancing in the kitchen. Mm. That sounds boring. No, it's perfect. Why? There's no cover charge for Club Kitchen. And DJ Scott is amazing. But why, really? We get to do what we always dreamed of in our careers. We get to help people, have a home filled with laughter. I sometimes get caught up in the day by day but we should all be so lucky. Do you get out? Oh, like this? Do you travel? You mean, like Hawaii? I did. Who doesn't it. So many questions. Well, this is a first date, Scotty Smooth. Any regrets? My only regret is not ordering that chicken sandwich two years ago when you claimed it. You can still order one. Now there'd be nothing to share. Where's the fun in that? Not on the first date. Maybe, we can do it again sometime. What are we studying next? It's a surprise. Do you ever wish that you had waited to see what your career was gonna do first? I always figured it was better to follow your heart rather than to have it told what's possible. Yeah, but how did you know... like really know that you're making the right decision? It sounds like you got a lot on your mind. I just feel like I can't get ahead of things. Know what to do for sure no matter how much I put in... You put in your spreadsheets. I guess I don't change. But you act like that's a bad thing. Without you, we'd always be out of something at the house, right? And even on top of Abby's wedding planning like a boss. I have... I have. It's a nice night. Ooh, we gotta get back. Save your parents from babysitting. Impressed? Maybe just a little. You know, your mom warned you about guys like me. And I didn't listen. Apparently not. Computer, swing the house down! - Oh, no, no, no... - Oh, yes. - No. No... - Oh... - oh... -it's gonna happen. OK. Here we go. Oh! Um, Scott? Yes, dear? The blood's rising to my head. Well, that explains your healthy glow. Um, let's just... Yeah, I... I think that's enough dancing. I don't know how to explain this but I... I'm not who you think I am. The... the woman in this picture, that's not me. I'm not her. Hey, I get it. Hah, you do? Yeah. I mean our lives are pretty crazy. Yesterday, we were a couple of kids in med school. And now we got a mortgage, and laundry, and endless piles of dishes, and boom! Just like that. But, hey, we got this. Yeah. So... Hey. So, uh, Dylan had trouble falling asleep again tonight. He has a test tomorrow and he's letting his nerves get the best of him. Wait, Dylan has test anxiety? We've been over this. He's the smartest kid in his class. He just gets a little nervous every once in a while. Well, I had the same thing as a kid. We need to do something about it. I don't know, get him a tutor or something. We already tried that. Look, if we just let it go, he'll be fine. He'll grow out of it. No, he won't. Trust me. Look, I really don't wanna fight about this tonight, OK? Come here. Come here. I missed you today. You, too. Can you drop the kids off at school on your way to work tomorrow? Work? Yeah. You know, that thing we do to afford a nice life in the suburbs? Right. Work tomorrow. Mm-hmm. I am gonna go pick out something to wear for work tomorrow. Everything OK in there? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Good morning, Doctor. Morning. Doctor. Dr. Rivers. Hello. Sorry, yes, Rachel. What are you Still down here? Working. I know, but it's Tuesday. What, we don't work on Tuesdays? No, we do, but you're usually out of here by now for date night. Date night, every Tuesday with Scott. Are you feeling OK? Dr. Rivers, the other one, mentioned that you hit your head? I did. It's just... it's just been a long day. Sure, I get it. Great job today by the way. I've never seen someone make a child laugh while sticking a needle in their arm. Thanks, Rachel. Scott, honey. Hey. You almost home? Your mom will be here soon to watch the kids. Can we reschedule? We haven't missed a date night in 10 years. I just... I can't right now. I still have so much work to do. It's, um... It's OK. Well, uh, I'll just see you when you get home. I love you. I love you, too. Hey. Hey. Did you get my text? No, sorry, I haven't looked at my phone. Oh, apparently, Emma has a project due tomorrow she hasn't started on. Oh. But I rounded up some supplies and we're gonna dish it out. What, are you just gonna throw something together for her? I mean, what if she fails her project? Oh, she won't fail. But maybe, she'll learn to be more prepared next time. How are you always so calm about this stuff? How was I supposed to feel? It'll be fine. Hey, I'm sorry about tonight. It's fine. All right. I'll be upstairs if you need me. Emma, you want Popsicle sticks or fuzzy sticks? Um... Look, I think Popsicle sticks. Where are the kids? It's after 9:00. You fell asleep. Yeah. Thank you. So did Emma finished her project? It's a little rushed, but it's done. I guess I really screwed up today, huh? Well, you know, yes, you did. Natalie, if something's going on, talk to me. Well, there is something going on. I knew it. I'm scheduling a CT scan first thing tomorrow. Oh, it's not that. I just feel like I'm letting everybody down. Well, then, I'd love to agree with you, but then, we'd both be wrong. I know you're under a lot of pressure, but you're not alone. We're in this together, we're figuring it out. All right? I'll take the kids to school tomorrow morning so you could sleep in a bit. So you have another busy day tomorrow? I'm sure I do. I know. I don't like... I'm not a fan of the pecans in the cake. I mean... Well, I like that. Got an easy solution. So what do you think? We've been here, uh, three hours. You might want to... I know but I like both. Like, I really like... It's between these two. Well, there's an obvious solution if you can't decide between one and the other. OK. So we'll do one layer of red velvet and another one of Italian cream. Ta-da! - Right? Mm-hmm. OK. Everything's gonna be perfect, right? Of course. I just hope Brian and I can have what you and Scott have. Oh. OK, this whole thing could fall apart at any second. What? I'm serious. No. I know. With each choice, each decision, you just put love first and try and hold it together. I have it under control. I won't let you down. I guess you have more to reveal. Feeling nostalgic? I am, too. All this wedding stuff. Is this what you wanted? What do you mean? This life. When you asked me to marry you, is this the life you imagined? No, it's better than I imagined. I wouldn't want it any other way. Mwah! So I talked to the school counselor about Dylan and she wants us to come in tomorrow for a meeting. OK. Well, it is a good thing. Maybe we'll find a solution and now actually get some sleep. Ah! That would be amazing. Well then, yeah, wouldn't that so good. Mommy, test tomorrow. Daddy... Sure this is the life you imagined? Of course. We went out. No, that was a study session. All right. Wait here. One sec. Scott... You said you wanted a second study session. This is kind of our thing. Well done, sir. What? It's just... this reminds me of when you said yes and turned my life upside down. For the better. I'm glad. I got down on one knee with a grass ring... Scott... -and you said... Pass the noodles? I love you, Natalie Rivers! What are you doing? I love you, Natalie Rivers. Scott, there are the kids over there. Now you say it. You say it to me. No, there's people walking around. I'll keep saying it. I love you, Natalie... Fine! I love you, Scott Rivers. Now I know that's not how you feel about me. I'm disappointing you. I love you, Scott Rivers! See? No, they agree. This picnic's pretty perfect. Thank you. For you, anything. Nervous? No. I am/ I can't help thinking that maybe you were right all along. He needs some guidance, his testing anxiety's isn't just gonna go away. You were right, too. I tried to encourage him the other day and he completely fall apart. It felt awful. All I wanna do what's best for them but it's so easy to... to question every decision I make as a parent. We're gonna make the wrong choice sometimes but that doesn't undermine the things we get right. You're a great dad. Yeah, but you're like super mom. I love watching you with the kids. They just light up around you. We make a pretty good team. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. - Oh, it's OK. - Don't worry about it. Thank you. One of my students missed her bus. Oh, dear. Oh, no, she's OK. I'm so glad you could come in together. It's wonderful when we can all work as a team. So, let's talk about Dylan. Well, we know Dylan understands the materials. So what do we do to ease his anxiety? Well we try to encourage him but it doesn't help. It just makes it worse. I hate seeing him struggle like this. So what can we do differently? We could try moving him to the front of the class. Sometimes that's helpful. That could really work and it would eliminate distractions. And then, we could come up with the game plan at home for when he has his test. Something for him to turn to when he begins to panic. Excellent. I'll send you some resources and study techniques. All Dylan needs to know is that these tests are designed to help him, not punish him. OK? OK, got it. We got this. I think you do. You saved that little girl's life. But I don't know about that. I'm serious. I would have never connected all those symptoms to an allergic reaction, but you were thinking fast. It feels good to know that I can really help people here, you know, in so many different ways. Well, that is why you started the practice, right? Yeah, I guess it must be. Well done, Dr. Rivers. You know, that little girl reminded me of Emma. I just looked at her and all I could think about was how to make her feel better. It's because you're a great doctor and a great mom. All right. Crack 'em and throw 'em, guys. - See that go in. - Flying everywhere. Uh-huh. Yeah. Part of it. Mommy! Hi, guys. Hey. There she is. Oh, I missed you so much today. Hi, bud. Hey. Ooh, hello. Mm-mm. How are you? Great. Oh, great. Hi. Oh, hi. How was work today? - It was really good. - Yeah? Yeah. That's great. We wanna hear all about it. Yes. We made dinner for you. You did? Spaghetti and mac and cheese. You did? Your favorite. Oh, wow. I can't wait. Sure it'll tastes as good as it looks. Keep throwing them in there. There you go. - Yah! Good job. Oh, wow, it's flying again. Computer, play something soft and romantic. Although the clouds, they I see the moon shining bright. Maybe the sky La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Yeah, I got that one. Oh, sister, let's go down. Let's go down, come on down. Oh, sister, let's go down. All right. You guys ready? Yeah. There you go, Emma. Lunch for you. Lunch for you. Let's turn around, there you go. And your flute. Thank you. Now, tell Mommy what you're going to do if you feel anxious in school today. Problems and eat them for breakfast. That's great, buddy. All right, let's go! So you're liking what you see? Well, I'm completely exhausted, and I'm a little weirded out from eating mac and cheese and spaghetti for dinner. But I guess that's what I was supposed to see. And things with Scott seemed really great. Oh, I'm so glad. But, I don't know, I'm worried that the good moments are just moments. Oh, well. Be the same thing with the bad moments. They're just moments. Yeah, I guess you're right. Mm-hmm. So what now? Do... do I go back? Well, that is really up to the veil. The veil seems to be calling a lot of shots lately. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Abby, hey. No, uh, I didn't forget. Who do you think you're talking to? OK, great. See you soon. I completely forgot to book the hairdresser for her. Oh, honey, don't fret. I got a great girl. What else? Everything. I mean, I'm completely in over my head with this wedding. Listen to me. You are always the one with the master plan, and I know you. And you in any form, you can solve any problem with a spreadsheet in a folder full of research. You're right. I mean, future me can't be that different. That's right. Exactly. Now, uh, I'll make a list of birthdays and anniversaries and that's gonna help you with the passwords, right? Yeah, and I'll dive into the spreadsheet. And I'll call the hairdresser. Can you find out if he could come over here? Right. And you'll work on everything else. Work, I... I have to work today. Mm-mm, you have the day off. I arranged it two weeks ago. Mimi, what would I do without you? Oh-oh. All right. Natalie let's see if you were the same person you always been. Come on! Oh, OK. Abby's wedding. Well, Natalie, a 27-page spreadsheet, that's, um... That's something. Wow, this woman can run a family practice. Coming. Ah, this is so much better than having to drive across town of a salon. Thank you, Natalie. Oh, you know me, always two steps ahead. What do you think? It's a simple updo but is it too simple? Should have any braids, or curls, or... No, it's beautiful. What's wrong? You look worried. I'm fine. Wait, stop! Why are you gonna put it on over her face just so you have to pull it back again. Yeah, that's how it works. Well, it all works, right? Mm-hmm. That was surprisingly intense. You have made my dream wedding come true. Thank you for being here. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. All right. Your turn. Mm. I didn't know I could look like this. It reminds me of your wedding day. I guess I never really saw myself this way in the future... I mean, the past... Ah, I don't know what I'm saying. You never saw yourself what way, Natalie? As an amazing, brilliant, beautiful woman? That's how I've always seen you. That's how everyone sees you. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you see this woman? I mean, really see her? Have you ever really seen her? Oh. According to my 27-page wedding plan, you have to pick up your marriage license. Mm, I'm on it. And I'm gonna take the kids to the park. Oh, well, have fun. I will see you later. You good? This is the best day ever. Even though the man, he likes all that mushy stuff. What I do know is when we were in medical school, he would stay up really late studying because he worked during the day at the campus bookstore. He saved up enough money for three months to take me to the mountains during winter break. I had never seen snow before. No way! I love snow. Yeah, never in my whole life. We were going to a lecture, he said. But when we landed, we were in the mountains and it was snowing. We played in it the entire weekend. That's so Dad. He really has always been thoughtful and very good at surprises. Yeah, when he... like, when he surprises us by picking us up early at school and we skip classes just to go on an adventure. He does that? No. Well, to me it sounds like a really good dad. Yeah. I mean, he is a really good dad. He the keeper, that's what you always say. Need some more? You're so silly, Mommy. I wish we could come here tomorrow so I don't have to take that test. You're gonna do great, buddy. When we get home, I'll show you some of my marking strategies that helped me when I had my test, OK? OK. They're so pretty. I love the ducks. Wanna go to the playground? Yay! Hey, dad. Hey, honey, where are you? I've decided to keep the kids for the evening. It's been so nice to have some time with them. What about dinner? Oh, shoot, it's Tuesday. Dinner with Scott. It's not just Tuesday. It's Abby and Brian... -your double date. You've been excited about this for weeks. But it wasn't in my spreadsheet. You forget? No, of course not. Um... where is it again? Same place in town you always go to. Right. OK, I'm gonna drop the kids off right now. OK. See you soon. Bye. OK, kids, it's time to go to mom and dad... uh, I mean grandma and grandpa's. Oh, I'm gonna get you. Yay! Ready for some fun? Have a great time. Do you have any address? No. I remember that it's on Main and Atlantic. You should know how to get there. I'm fine. I'm just a little frantic cause I'm running late. Um, I will pick them up when we're done. OK. All right. Drive Safe. - I will. Bye. Scott. I can't believe I found this place. Sorry, I'm late. I called. No, there's no reception in there. I forgot. It wasn't in my spreadsheet. What are you talking about? We've been planning this for weeks. I'm calling Dr. Hammond. Something's off. You don't call Dr. Hammond. I'm fine. I'm just juggling a lot right now. You're not fine, Natalie. I'm worried. Hey, give me a break. I'm trying really hard here. Why don't we just go home? Come back some other time when you're up for it. I'm up for it now. You've been so stubborn. I'm not being stubborn, Scott. Just trying to keep my promises. Sorry I'm not perfect. No one expects you to be perfect. Honey, you put this pressure on yourself. Nobody else does. What you said the other day, about this not being your life... It's really not the time. Look, I understand the need for soul searching and questioning whether or not you're on the right path, but I have to know. Are you unhappy with our marriage? Abby and Brian are waiting. Let's just go inside. Come on. You don't usually mind when I order for you. Just because I order something once doesn't necessarily mean that I want it that way forever. But you always order the same thing, so... You could have checked with me, that's all. Would you like the same tiramisu you always get or would you like something different, honey? Uh, no dessert for me, thank you. OK. Tiramisu, two spoons. Yeah. So, um, I suppose we should tell you why we wanted to get dinner. We wanted to get your advice on writing our own vows. Oh. It's probably not the best time. Well, wedding's Saturday so not many nights left. Everything I write is just so trite, and the vows at your wedding were so beautiful. Don't you have any tips you can share? Maybe, think of the first time you fell in love. Vows will come. That's good. Yeah. What else? We need to find something that's personal for the two of you. Of course, there are relationships and people that you look up to, but what is it that you find in yourselves makes you two so good together? Don't deny yourself. I want us to know each other like that. And I think one of the reasons we're so good together is that we're so curious and endlessly fascinated with life and each other. It sounds like you're well on your way to writing some pretty beautiful vows. And a happy marriage. What are you guys watching? Our wedding video. Emma thought it would be fun. What's wrong with the sound? Your cousin had it muted till we started our vows. Oh. This is my favorite part. It was the first time you've watched it without cringing. It's cute. Oh, it's a good thing you weren't aware of it that day. Oh, you look nervous. I was afraid if something went wrong, you wouldn't wanna marry me. Oh, guess I hadn't yet figured out what I would be missing. Hey, buddy. I'm sorry I've been messing up so much lately. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on you when you're already stressed. Sometimes I just get wrapped up in my own world. We both do. - I - promise to never let fear get in the way of my love for you. Have I kept that vow? Oh, I mean, there was that one time. Of course. Love and fear have battled it out a little but in the end, love always wins. We wouldn't be here if it hadn't. I'm glad I'm here. I love our life. I love you. I love you, too. Hey. Hey. It's fine. I have a feeling I'll be back to my normal self very soon. OK. I just don't wanna forget what a moment like this feels like. Maybe I can help with that. Let's see how it ends. I promise that in the busyness and routine of everyday life, I will find the moments to remind you how special you are to me. Natalie? The wedding's off. What? Sweetie, you're just scared. I'm sure if you think about it hard enough, you can find reasons that you still wanna marry Brian. What? Now, this isn't nerves. I still wanna marry Brian. There was a flood. What? Yeah, there was a pipe that burst and there's water everywhere. The place is all wet, three inches of water. I'd... the wedding's off. No. There are other places. No, we've already looked. They're booked. No. Uh, churches, uh, reception halls, hotel conference rooms, lobbies. I mean, come on! Weddings, company parties, school dances, they're all booked. We could have it at Louie's. I mean, he loves us and the food's amazing. Brian and I love that restaurant but does he even take reservations? I can call him. I mean, his family are friends of mine. I think he might do it. We would scale down a little bit but... Mm, a lot. It could work. - OK. - Yeah? Yeah. OK, let's do it. - OK. OK. Do it. I'm getting married in three days! Yes! Oh. OK, I gotta go. Go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hey, guys. Hey. Mommy, Mommy, guess what? What? Show her, buddy. Dylan! Good job. I'm so proud of you. Here. Me, too, Dylan. The stuff you told me really helps. So this calls for celebration. You know what that means? Breakfast for dinner! Yay! Pancakes! Yay! Chocolate chips! This dress is so beautiful. Oh, don't make me cry. Linda just did my makeup. No. Girls, girls, girls. No crying yet, please. Hmm. Oh. Hey, it's almost time. Finally, I feel like I've been waiting forever. Mm-hmm. Any last minute nerves? No. Hmm. You don't think Brian's having any last minute nerves, do you? I'm sure he's fine, honey. Can you go check? Mm-hmm. I'll go. You'll be fine. And I have to get dressed. Wow. I could say the same about you. You look beautiful. Thank you. Can I ask you a question? How did you know it could be like this? In all those years ago when we were just two kids in medical school, how did you know that it... That we could be this way? I didn't know. I just hoped. But I knew there wasn't anyone else who wanted to try it with. I hope I didn't screw this up. How could you say that? The way it looks perfect, you did an amazing job. Come here. Welcome to Aunt Abby's wedding. Natalie, I think it might be time. But I don't wanna go. I know but you'll be back sooner than you realize. I'm not so sure. These things aren't really bad. What if I lose all of this before I even have it? Honey, Scott loves you and you love him. It'll be OK. Now, listen to me. This is very important. When the reveal is over, your question if it was even real, your mind will tell you that was all a dream, but your heart will know the truth. So please, honey, trust your heart. OK? Thank you, Mimi. Ow. I love you. Welcome to Aunt Abby's wedding. Mimi? What? Did that really happen? Did what happen? I... I saw... I saw him... uh, Scott, and I had kids. And Abby was getting... I told you, there's just something about this old veil. It makes... it helps you imagine things that could be. But I didn't imagine it, did I? I... I don't know. How do you feel? Did... did it help you decide anything? I saw my life, and I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. I have to talk to Scott. I have to get to the airport. Ugh, I'm never gonna get there with traffic and parking. Honey, Abby is coming over so she can take you to the airport. - OK, great! - OK! OK. Hey, hey, hey. Oh. All right, take a deep breath. Oh, Abby, thank God. Hey. I am so sorry that I have not been there for you like I should be. What are you talking about? I have done a terrible job at being your big sister. Oh, no, you haven't. Yes, I have. OK, but you're perfect the way you are. I don't wanna be perfect. I just wanna enjoy every moment of this incredible journey and my beautiful family. Can you take me to the airport? Sure. Is everything OK? Yeah. I just have to find Scott. Thank you, Mimi. Mwah. Oh, and drive careful. I'll tell you later. - Oh, what's going on with... - All right. - Scott? - Um... Good... it's kinda... -luck! Of a story. Ay-ya-yay. And then I'm freaking out because it's the first time in my life that I don't have a plan to guide me, and then he proposes. Proposes? Yeah, but I said no. You said no? Well, I was caught off guard and terrified, and completely unsure of what I wanted. But now you're sure? What changed your mind? I got the clarity I needed. But it doesn't matter now. He's going to Chicago and it may be over for good and I thought that I could fix it, but we'll never even get there in time with all this traffic. They're redirecting traffic. It doesn't matter, his plane's taking off for like five minutes anyway. Can you just... can you just turn up here? Yeah. Scott? Natalie. What are you doing here? I'm just gonna ask you the same thing. I missed my flight. You know me, always late. It's one of the things I love about you. I booked another one, for tomorrow, same time. So you're still going? Yeah, I'm still going. Is that what you want? It's for the best, I think. I just... I don't want you to go to Chicago. Natalie, please don't make this harder than it already is. OK, I'm sorry I hurt you. You were right. We're better off. Is that how you really feel? I made a mistake. Natalie, I get it. I'm just not the one... No, just... will you just listen to me? I love you. I was just overwhelmed and scared and I wasn't thinking clearly. But I am now and I've seen my life and you're in it. I want you today, tomorrow, forever. And if you'll have it, I want us to have a life together. There's gonna be a beautiful little girl named Emma who thinks that her father hung the moon and... What are you talking about? - A little boy named Dylan who looks up to you like you wouldn't believe. And we're gonna have breakfast for dinner and adopt a family of ducks from this very pond. And every night when we do the dishes, we're gonna dance and it's gonna be beautiful, and chaotic, and crazy, but that's life. And I want it to be our life more than anything. I want you and I want us, and I want it to start today, right here. I just don't know how we can go from this to that. I do. I make a promise to never let fear get in the way of my love for you. And I know I'm gonna get scared sometimes, so are you, but it doesn't matter because when I close my eyes, I can't picture my life without you. I just wanted you to know how I felt. Natalie, wait. I love you. I love you, too. Let's make it happen. Now. Yeah. And is this your life? I hope so. Let's go. - OK. Come on. Hmm. Still into pastels, I see. What do you think of an outdoor wedding. You know, a garden theme? That's a great idea. We could have it in the park by the pond. Oh, that would be stunning. There go my final residency applications. Oh, yes. Now, we wait. Where do you hope you'll land? It doesn't matter. I just wanna help people and be with you. I don't know, I have a feeling I might want to have my own practice one day. Really? That's my girl. I think I'll be good at it. I have no doubt. Everyone, everyone. I'd like to propose a toast to my first born and to my first son-in-law-to-be. May you have what Janine and I have. I love you both. Cheers! Cheers! Dad, I love you. Whew! I wanna go. Yeah. Everything OK? Oh, it's great. OK. Um, you should go talk to her. What... oh, no. I... I wasn't, uh... I didn't... Oh, she's... she's smart, and kind, and she wants to be a doctor, and she has a strange affinity for knock, knock jokes. Well, I don't wanna bother her. I don't think she'd mind. Hi. I think you should go talk to him. Are you crazy? Hmm. He might very well be the one, you know. I don't think so. Mm, hey, he's very nice. Kind, smart, loves baseball, and cooking. And mom and dad would love him. OK, how do you know all of this? I met him once since a long time from now. Go talk to him. Oh, hi. Ooh, I don't know. I just have a feeling. Everyone, thank you so much for being here to help celebrate our engagement. We are so happy to share this moment with our friends and family. I am honestly the luckiest guy alive. I am able to share the rest of my life with the perfect woman and celebrate with this amazing family. So have a great time, don't do anything I wouldn't do, and again, thank you all. Cheers! Cheers. Thanks for coming. Hey, I didn't get any. Oh, I'm sorry! Mm. I love this place. We should come here more often. - I have a feeling we will. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. Mm. Shall we? Yes, please. The perfect woman, huh? That's not me. I know. Me, neither. We're perfect together. That we are.
