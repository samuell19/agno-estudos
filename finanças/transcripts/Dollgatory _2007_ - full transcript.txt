Wow! What a shit hole! What the hell was I thinking opening up a dollar store? Look at this fucking place... Garbage! I carry useless items that only hams would purchase and the sad part is... They don't buy anything! Shit!!! No one buys anything, "buck or more," my ass. I should have named this place, the bargain bin special! Well, things could always be worse. I could always be Jean. What a dick! Love the guy, though. I pay him 30 bucks a day, and he's satisfied. Man, I admire that. I wish, in a way, I could live a simple life - like pepe here. But I always want more and more. A taste of the good life. Money! Ouuu! Oouuuu!! Mr. Speedopoulos, why do you always make that sound every time you see me? Because, Jean, you're French. And French people have an 'ooouuu' when they talk. I see. Hey, Jean... Have you, um, ever thought of just grabbing a gun and calling it a life? Sometimes. Right. Me, too. Jean, you do realize that I'm losing a lot of money here, having this dollar store? Yeah, I kinda figured. Yet, you continue to work for me. Yeah. And? Are you mentally challenged in any way? Wanna talk about it? Mr. Speedopoulos... I know you can turn things around. What we need is a miracle. In situations like this, Jean, you gotta stay cool and calm. It's very critical. Follow my motto: I might break, but I won't bend it. That doesn't sound right. Okay, my mistake. If it isn't broken, don't try to break it anymore. Fuckin' metaphors! I never can get them right! Anyway... Watch and learn how to pick up za' broad. Well, hello, hello, there. Is there anything in particular you're looking for today, ma'am? Such as a stud-muffin like myself? I don't associate with losers. But thanks, anyway. I tell you, pepe... The minute I see pink-painted toenails, I'm blowin' my load in two seconds! It's plain and simple - this broad clearly wants to rub my nuts all over her toes. And the minute that she does that-- it's just an immediate explosion... That's so fucking-- hey! Having fun? Hmm, absolutely. Two bucks for these? You've got to be joking me! This is, after all, a buck or more. Get it? More... The dollar store across the street is selling the same ones for 50 cents. Those pricks! Cents' n dollars! Bastards! I'm sure we can work something out here. How about, umm, 50 cents for the clips... Accompanied by a blowjob, of course, and we'll call it even. Jerk! Mr. Speedopoulos! She just took off with the hairclips. Story of my life... Nailed yet again! Well, shift's up. All right. Have a great night. Hey, pepe! What makes dollar n cents so much better than US? The owner, Josie crups. She's a real witch... But she's got good stuff. That would explain why every night I see a witch flying by on a broom. Uh, that wasn't funny. Jean, onward. Okay, so according to my calculations, i'm... 300,000 dollars in the hole. So that means suicide is a definite go! George, we're in trouble. Really? You could have fooled me. I just got fired. - Ahhh, that's great. - Are you listening to me? We have no money! So go out and get a job! Is that all you have to say? What else do you want me to say? You can be a little more considerate. Why don't you consider this... [Farts] Listen here, fucker! I'm not going on welfare! You hear me? Honey, you're clearly pms-ing. Now just settle down. Don't tell me to settle down, you geek! Shhhh. Keep it down. You're gonna chase away the customers. [Sound of crickets chirping] George, what you're gonna do is sell this place. Now!!! Yeah. Are you listening? I can just hear all the buyers lining right up. I am...The law. And here we go. What's goin' on, asshole? Hello there, officer. So, speeda speeda speedopoulos... I see you still haven't paid for that parking fine from last week. For parking in a handicap spot for like two secs while I get a cup of coffee? My break is-- you're gonna grab yourself a cup of shut up, horse nuts. You know, you fucker... You should be ashamed of yourself - exploiting the physically impaired! Well, your mom didn't have a problem with me last night. That's a good one! It's a natural talent. You're good at it. You malaka! A little help here, Gina! Speedopoulos... You talk... When I tell ya' to talk. Human puke! That's what you are! You make me sick! Get up! - I've got rights! - You have rights? I tell ya' what rights you got. You have the right to cell 33 - with my personal favorite... Bubba. It's true. Gina! Get the lubrication ready, buddy! Oh, George! You're such a loser! Thanks, Jean, for bailing me out. Thank yourself for stashing away that thousand bucks. Now, I'm completely broke. I can't believe Gina. She didn't even attempt to bail me out. Can I get some help here? Hello! Can I get some help here? Which one of these brands lasts longer? Well, I really couldn't tell you. Such a typical guy - never has answers, always excuses. Don't you? Okay, look - yep! That's the winner. Because the packaging looks better? Why do men always notice what's on the outside - never what's inside? All I'm saying is that most customers that come in buy that brand. That's all. So now you're changing your tune. First it was I don't know. Now it's I like this one. Do you do this with every woman? Look, clearly you have some serious mental issues, so, uh, I'm gonna just go to the back now. Are you saying I'm crazy? I'm not crazy! Why do men always think I'm crazy? My ex-boyfriend used to tell me that all the time. Maybe because you ask questions? Maybe-- you always ask questions! You have a problem with that? You're trying to pick me up, aren't you? You know what? Just take the batteries. It's on me. I don't think I want your stupid batteries! Why do I even bother? Why did I come in here for? What color am I gonna paint my toenails? What am I gonna do-- Can I help you? Hey, man, you trying to kill me? I had a lady over last night, and these things keep falling off. Are you kidding me? No, I'm serious! I haven't had sex for a long time, and now I get a bad reputation because of you! I wasn't the one who tried to shag with balloons now, was I? Where you from? Egypt! You got a problem with that? Look, I don't know what you do back home, bud, but if you wanna shag properly, balloons are not the way. There's places like drug stores, where you can buy condoms. Well, I want a refund? This is a dollar store; We sell dollar stuff. Sorry, no refunds. I want my money! No! Now it worked! Oh...god... Killing time, I see, George. Hold that thought. It's on the house. So, George, tell me. How does it feel knowing you're losing money? Not too good, I'm sure. Well, at least some of US are making profit. I made $20,000 clear last month. Wow! Maybe you can use some of that money towards purchasing a lifetime supply of gum! Maybe you can shut your mouth, considering the situation you're in right now. What I make in a month, you make in a year. Now that's hilarious. That's right, loser. I'd just thought I'd leave my proof here for you to admire. Have a nice day! Well...time to count up the losses. Well, pepe... To cover our expenses this month alone... Ten grand! Ohhh. That's not good, boss. Yeah, I'm pretty much done. What do you expect selling stupid things like these-- stupid cards! Hey! That's our number-one seller. Exactly my point! Like, look at this one. "The little train that couldn't." Zooming across the barriers, through the arduous mountains, little train soon realized that he was going nowhere in a heartbeat. He couldn't get any loans because he was broke. He couldn't get any piece of ass because he was an ugly son-of-a-bitch. He couldn't sell the dollar store, because it was a piece of shit. Little train concluded that the only option was to drive over the hill and call it a life. That's something he could do. Well, we gotta get money somehow. Yeah, I know. But I've already exceeded all my loans. And Gina just got fired, so now we have no income coming in. I'm thinking. What was I thinking opening this shack up? Well, you could always kill your wife, collect her life insurance. Make it look like an accident. No, Mr. Speedopoulos, I was just-- that's brilliant! Her insurance is worth at least a million dollars - and I'm the benefactor! You'll never get away with it, boss. Ah, but I shall, pepe. Ah, Gina... You wanna mess around, everybody's gotta pay. And I'm cashing in. Woo! No, seriously. I really think-- silence! It's time for a taste of the good life. Now it's time to put the pedal to the gas. Isn't it - pedal to the puddle? No, wait. How does that saying go? It's, uh... I got it - time to put pedal to the cradle, before it rattles. That's it! I'm a genius. Now it's time to eliminate the plague called -- the wife! What? It's not good enough for you? When are you selling that stupid dollar store anyways? When I find a suitable buyer! Is that all right with you? Actually, no. It's not all right with me. You know we owe a ton of money and I can't keep up. Don't you worry. I've got a master plan! Yeah? And what would that be, Houdini? I can't reveal that. You're always so cryptic. I don't remember the last time you made love to me, George. Why don't you ask yourself this question: When was the last time you actually showered? How about that one? How rude! Does it make you feel better about yourself, making fun of me all the time? Yeah, pretty much. You know, most, uh, married couples do have sex once in a blue moon. That's the problem with you married women. It's all about me, me, me. What about me? How would you feel if your wife never pedicured her toes. What's wrong with my toes? Yeah...about that! Shut up! Meet me upstairs - two minutes! Oh, yeah - bring your a game! Ah, Jesus. That's just wrong! Honey, you know what we need here is -- a couple glasses of wine. You wanna head down and grab US some while I get things ready in here? Okay. Be back soon. Keep the bed warm. Ahhhhh..... Ahhhh..... I'm paralyzed here. My vertebrae is cracked. I need medical attention. Well? Aren't you coming? Come here, baby. You wanna play - rrruff! Rrufff! Grrrrr... Time to get nasty. Close your eyes. This ought to blow your mind. Yes, I'm ready! What are you waiting for? All right... Lights out! You fucker! She's dead. She's dead! You fucking bitch! Who's laughin' now? Time to celebrate. What? This happens all the time. Okay, gotta make it look like an accident. We were talking, and she had way too much too drink. She fell, broke her neck, so now... I'm a million dollars richer! No one's gonna believe that. [Dog barking in distance] What the hell have I done? I am in deep shit. I gotta get rid of the body. Shut up, dog! Fuck! Oh, my god. What have I done? I'm going straight to hell for this. I'm driving, but I have nowhere to go! Wait a second - what am I doing? It was an accident. I can't collect life insurance money without showing a body! I hope I don't end up burning in hell for this. Hey, what's happenin'? [Both screaming loudly] Holy shit!!! What the fuck? A minute ago I was driving... And now I'm here. That's messed up. Special delivery, dicksmack. Ha, ha! This is just one bad dream! Oh, it gets even worse. Now take the letter, you son-of-a-bitch! And I'll catch you later... Penis breath! Ha, ha! Unbelievable. "Dear George: Your crime against society was menacing to all. Your untimely death has brought you to the point where you shall stand before me and prepare to be judged accordingly. It's judgment day. In plain terms - the moment all of my children must stand tall and take responsibility for all their sins." Is this some kind of joke? "Your scheming has led you to the trial of judgment! Your heartless, conniving ways must be repented. You have done the unthinkable: Murder! So, in conclusion, you shall remain in the comfortable confines of the place you most despise - a buck or more - for eternity." Is he out of his mind? I hate this place! "In order to redeem yourself you must prove what humanity most lacks - humility to his fellow man. Numerous guests of my choice shall visit you, and at no time will you lose your cool, be nasty, or mischievous. You will do anything to assist them. If you succeed, you will be tried accordingly. For now, you shall remain a prisoner in dollgatory - a combination of the word 'dollar store' in a 'purgatory' world. Ha, ha! Best of luck!" What is this? Scrooge! This is impossible. Somebody's messing around with me. Gina! You got me. That was a good one, but I'm comin' home now. Like taking a popsicle from a kitten! No, wait... Taking a popsicle from a kid. That's it! It's taking candy from a baby, you moron... Moron, moron, moron... All right. I'll just jog on home. This ship's sinking... But not fast enough! You think I'd have a heart attack by now, but nooooo! What do you think you're doing? - Not you! - Got a problem? God, I'll keep running forever, just get rid of her! Please! Why are you always so rude? You think I'm ugly, don't you? How about this one... You need to get laid! Yeah, you're right. Thanks. This is torture! I can't get out of here! God...send me to hell! Anywhere but here. As a matter of fact - I'll take the Chinese water torture. Or better yet, a fork up my ass in hell. Just get me out of here! I need a smoke. Thank you, god! I knew you were kind. I missed you so dearly. Time to light you up. How about that! No lighters, no smoking! Fantastic! I'll call for help. No dial tone! So according to god, I'm a permanent fixture at this dump forever... Until I can redeem myself. Hence, I am, in fact, dead. God must be a chick. That's the only explanation. I am neither man nor woman, George. Rather an entity within all of you. Are you trying to confuse me here! Let the judgment begin. Ah, geez! George, are you ready to be judged accordingly? The dollar store clients will be coming in for a visit. You must respect and serve their needs. C'mon, man. This isn't real. Oh, it's real. Allow me to show you. Be advised that in order to pass, you must please the customers. Like, sexually? Take a good, hard look at yourself, George. Let's be real here! There's a catch as well. Everyone that comes into the store has lost their faith in god. You must make them believe once again. Are you crazy? I lost my beliefs a long time ago. Add to that, I'm a murderer! You expect me to solve these peoples' issues? That's what's expected of you. Talk about impossible. Wait a minute. I already killed the chicken with the stone! I think there's a rock in that saying. First off, it's not a chicken, it's a bird - pluralized for birds, which goes - two birds with one stone! Ducks, penguins, birds! Same shit! The 'question broad' - she needed to get laid. I told her the truth; she realized what she needed. I have to act like the oracle, a source of knowledge, a fountain of wisdom, etc, etc. Whatever! Hi, Mr. Speedopoulos. You look nice. Thanks, Jean. Everything okay? Everything's great. I just missed you. Anyways, I was thinking of painting my toenails pink. What do you think? Hmm... Come again. You heard me. Do we have anything in bright pink? That would be an immediate noooo! Nooo!! Well... How do you think it would look on me? Oh, boy. Come dance with me, boss! Hold that thought, pepe. We're about to get our asses kicked! What the hell's going on here?! Smells like something's burning. Oh, I see! What kind of fucking flamer are you? Pardon me? You heard me the first time, pansy ass! I don't like your tone, officer! I don't appreciate your gayness, twerp. Who's your fairy god mother now, huh? Call the police! At your service! Leave him alone! Don't touch him! Silence, silence! Hey, dickweed, can't you see - I'm in the middle of a serious interrogation session here. You're torturing the guy! You wanna see torture, speedopoulos? Yeah, that's gotta hurt, you little punk! That hurts, doesn't it?! Malone! What the hell are you doing? Suzy! What does it look like I'm doing? I'm laying down the law! I see you received the divorce papers. Yeah, I got them. And couriered, too. Real nice touch. Well, I had to use the money in your sock drawer for something good! Oh, really? That was for my weekly lap dances... You whore! You pig of a man! Geez! Can you give me a hand, buddy?! Everyone hold the fork! Uh, that would be fort. Right. I'm sure there's an explanation here. Yeah, she's psychotic! Well, there is. You see, Malone... I never really loved you! You just didn't know how to satisfy me. Is that right? I thought I was marrying a cop, not a security guard! Ouch! You shut the fuck up! Look, this is just an episode of "as the world circles" gone bad. I-- I thought that was funny. You just make your way. Now, you! Stop shaking your head at me! Say something! God, they just won't stop! What is it about marriage that changes people? Must be the pressure of maintaining a sense of excitement. Or maybe people just get married because they don't want to end up alone. I'm a prime example. The real question - how many times has Jean jerked off to me? I guess I never knew he was gay. Hey, man, to each his own. The fact is I decided to kill my wife for what? Money! and why? So I could eliminate the stress of paying off my debts and living comfortable. And here I am trapped in a buck or more. We just want the easy way out, without putting time and effort in. I guess if you could get away with it, why wouldn't you? Clearly Malone and Suzy have lost their faith in god and life. But I guess in today's society, it's not hard to. And Jean just pinched my ass. Someone just entered! Oh, how exciting! Let's see who the mystery guest is now! And we'll just turn right back around. Hi there, George. Didn't quite finish off the job. Gina! I can explain. You greedy bastard! I was just messing around. I wasn't expecting you to actually die! Oh, you're gonna pay. I'm already there, snacks! But don't worry. Everything will be fine. You're dead! There's no hope! No, you're wrong! Look, I'm gonna take the horns from the bull and I'm gonna make this right. It's bull by the horns, you idiot! Sure, sure it is. Not him. Don't you dare walk away from me, George. I don't know how I got here, but I gotta tell you, this store really blows! Sphinx, what do you want? My condoms! King tut! You interrupted me. Get your camel ass out of here! - Who's the mouthpiece? - Pardon me? You want a piece of this action? You want a piece of my fist! Yeah, that's great! Releasing the tension... That's good. Why don't we all all have some chocolates, huh? Shut up! You're all nuts! The problem with women is the following: They never listen. And I'll give you guys a prime example. Just like pandora's box. She's told not to open it. What does she do? She opens it. Curiosity is the outcome, leading to a lifetime dosage of soap operas - accompanied by, of course, the housewife, who decides she's bored. So what does she decide to do? She decides to fuck the landscaper, or better yet, the plumber with the nice ass crack. Then we have Eve - my personal favorite. She's told to eat an apple. So she takes a good old bite out of it... Because a snake told her to take a bite out of it. I mean, how fucking stupid can you be to talk to a fucking snake who talks?! I mean, seriously. Fuck, they're fucking stupid, man! Excuse you! How dare you degrade women like that. Listen, you shouldn't take any offense. I never said anything wrong about...Shemales! You pompous bastard! I'm gonna kill you! Bring it on! Why don't you just both relax? I am so terrified! Just ignore them, pepe. They'll eventually shut their traps. You can't kill yourself, George. You're already dead! How about that. I'm not even bleeding. Get me out of here! I can't take it. Just like in life, George, you're always giving up. [All chattering] Stop! I'm getting a migraine from all of you! Ahhh, can't hack the pressure? Somebody get the baby a soother! That's a good one, foundation queen. Suzy, stay out of this. All right? I'm the only one who gets to pick on the dick! Whatever, blue balls. Why don't both of you just give it up? We've got donut pusher here, and a wannabe diva! Pathetic! You're one to talk. At least I still have a job! Everyone just shut up! I've had just about enough. I've been here for... Who knows how long. And I've just about had it. All right, people. Enough talking. I say we shop! Now that's the spirit. Finally you've come to your senses. You'll actually make some sales finally. Speedopolous, what kind of scam are you running here? Five bucks for these? Inflation, man. What a rip! These pads are expired! Whatever. They all do the same job. Buy one, get another free. But I don't wanna get a yeast infection. Eww! Wait a minute. Pads can't expire. Sure they can. That's retarded! Just go grab some tissue. It works the same. Disgusting! What the hell is this? It's a dollar store. We sell bottom-of-the-barrel items! Are these ones gonna work?! Noooo, they're not! Once again, these are balloons! Look! Your cock does not go into this! Why didn't you tell me that before? Unbelievable! I'm bored. I say we listen to some music! Music? What are we gonna do with music? I hope you don't dance to it. That is the last thing I want to see. You're one to talk. Okay, George. We have a deal for you. We'll leave you alone, if you kiss...Jean! Uh, what? Take it or leave it. You're in deep shit, buddy. I'm gettin' the fuck out of here. You're on your own for this one. This isn't judgment. This is humiliation. Oh, just do it, George! Well done. You maintained composure in a rather precarious predicament. So, I'm done, right? Oh, no. That was the easy part. What? You know what you need to do George. Make them believe in you again? Restore love and humility, George. The one thing I granted all of you was the will to make decisions on your own. However, in life there are always difficult moments. One must learn to overcome the hard parts of life to reach the means to the goal of happiness, purity, and love for all your brothers and sisters. You realize these people are crazy? I know. That's why I hand-picked them for you. Oh, man. This is so bad. It can't get any worse. That's what you think. Holy smokes! You know what needs to be done, George. I have no idea what to do. Don't give up, boss. He's asking for the impossible. I can't show these people the light. I ain't an no angel. You have to. It's the only way out! Redemption! Jean, in life, I overlooked one main thing: That I was alive! Taking for granted the air you breathe. Yeah, typical human nature - always want more. And here's a prime example of greed. George, the clients weren't very pleased with your service. Why don't you just relax? I'm sick and tired of you pushing the little people around. I'm standing up for the rights of all the commoners. We ain't gonna back down. God made US all equal. Just because you make a little bit more money doesn't make you better than the rest of the world. Nobody respects tyrants! I bet you have like ten cats as pets. You probably sit at home with them, and talk to them... Eat dinner and make-- how did you know about my kitties, George? They love me, don't they? Not if you treat them the same way you treat everybody else. You're right, George. I haven't been very nice to you. Humility is a virtue. Not bad. There's still some hope for you. Hip-hip, hooray! Get me to the John after that touching moment! You're a real arrogant guy, Malone, and I've just about had it with your lip. If you keep this up, speedopoulos, you're gonna have a real sore lip soon! You just don't get it. Oh, I get it - that I'm staring at a pair of cupcakes! Shut your trap! What did you say? You heard me. Shut up! You're nothing more than a coward who feasts on picking on the weak! I'm talking to a dead man. Yes, you are... Dickhead! I'm gonna make this real quick for you. First, I'm gonna break your kneecaps. Then I'm gonna smash your arms. And the grand finale of them all... I'm gonna duct tape you dick-to-ass with rosseau over here. Hey, go for it. But when judgment day comes for you, I would sincerely pray that god doesn't, uh, stick you in a jail cell with all the boys you put away! He wouldn't! The big man - he works in mysterious ways. That wouldn't be too good now, would it? I mean, I would have to invest in a lifetime supply of... a-hole cream. Oh, I can give you some! Look, you're the law. Protect people. Don't abuse your powers for you own selfish pleasures. I know, speedopoulos, but it's just a rush! But it won't be after death. That's a good point. Uh, what's she doing here? So I tried getting laid, but you wanna know what happened? I went to the ex's house, and there he was - with another woman. So now what do I do? Look, there's about... Two billion other men you can call and get a date! There's 24-hour hotlines! You think this is funny? I need a man! I need sex! And I need it now! Where can I find a man? You're prayers have been answered. That's a fine, tight little ass you got there. So why don't you get on your knees and, uh, do the dirty! I don't sleep with cops! I dated a cop once. Wanna know what his name was? Rick. He cheated on me. Wanna know how I caught him? No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell US anyway! So, I was coming home from shopping one day and I went up to my room. And there he was with this other girl. What a slut! Why would he cheat on me? What did I do wrong? I did everything I could as a girlfriend. Maybe it's because I'm too short? Maybe he doesn't like my hair? I don't know what I did. Maybe I should have kicked her out. Maybe I should have beat her up? I don't know what else I was supposed to do? So which guy do you think screwed me over worse? How about this one - who gives a shit?! I think it was Rick. I'll tell you guys why. No! It's quite all right. I know that I have all the time in the world, but you're killing off my dollar store clientele here. And I really need to pass judgment day. Well, I'm not leaving until I get a man. And he better be cute. You got that? We're in dollgatory! There's no studs here! - Hey, man! - Who's that? Another mentally unstable individual. Hey, just to let you know - they worked! You actually had sex using a balloon? It was awesome! God! Dirty... Hey, baby. What's your name? They call me question woman. Wanna know why? They call me the pharos. How 'bout we talk about it over at my place? That would be great. Only in a dollar store! I thought you guys were done. Can't die in dollgatory, but sure as hell can go crazy. This calls for some brews! The vagina! If you think about it, it's kinda fucked up. I mean, it's used for sex, and then at certain times of the month it like, ovulates and lets out some real weird shit. And to top it off... Humans come straight out of it. Yet, we crave it. We even eat it out! That's why I stick with the penis. Not another word, please. And like, I always thought they pissed from the hole, but rumor is there's a second hole. - Seriously? - Yeah. It's near that thing that flaps back and forth on them. Oh, yeah. You know what that is? It's that thing that hangs from the camel toe. It's called the, uh-- work with me here, guys. It's the... The cleopatris! That's it. Whatever it is, it looks really weird! You know, I'll tell you guys a little story - a little Malone story. The first time I saw the vagina, I actually thought it was an alien. It's got these lips and it looks like it's gonna suck you in with these, like, umbilical cords. Just suck you right in and go ohhhwaaa... That's a real morbid analogy there, Malone. Thanks for just totally turning me off chicks! Hey, what are assholes for, man? God... What is up with women? George, women are creators such as myself. They have been chosen to nurture all of my children and sacrifice themselves for the well being of all. Well, that explains why the world's messed! Since we're on the topic of women, I would suggest drawing up a plan to resurrect faith in Suzy and Gina, since they will help determine the fate of your soul. Well, there goes that. Faith, my boy. Stay true to yourself. In our marriage - I never once received a card from you, George. Gina... I neglected you. I lost myself and forgot about the woman that I fell in love with. I should have been there for you, helped you out. I never realized you were so depressed all those lonely nights. Liar! I'm serious. You don't know what you have until it's taken from you. I just wanna be back home. That's all. He's lying. Don't believe him. We both just lost our faith, Gina. We just looked at the materialistic things in life. Man, there's kids starving to death, people that are homeless, abused, living in poverty - and we're worried about what car we're driving or what upgrades to make to the house. I'm ashamed, Gina. You're not god. You can't magically clap your hands and solve the world's problems, George. But what I can do is love you, and try my hardest to make a difference. You should get a medal for that acting performance. Gina, remember his true goal was to murder you for a million dollars. Killers - they deserve to go to one place. And that's straight to hell! Agreed. I should go to hell. All I'm saying is that... You still have a chance in life, and don't make the same mistake that I did. Or else you'll be trapped in dollgatory. Makes you feel pretty good, putting people down, doesn't it? Yeah. So? In your past, people made fun of you, didn't they? At one stage of our lives we're all made fun of or made to feel like crap. You don't have to stoop to their level - ever! Right, Josie? Bang on. Be humble, people. Never take for granted the air you breathe, or the ones you love. And, Jean, it's okay to be gay. Don't let anybody push you around. But I kinda like being ball-gagged. Well, then you got some serious issues. And what about you, George? It's believing in god. Without him, you're just a lost soul. You know, I actually feel better. That was marvelous... With a tear in my eye, speedopoulos. Congratulations... But I still don't like you. Anything else you'd care to share? God, I am a prodigy of your greatness... Just give me back my life. - My lord-- - murder, George! One of my teachings was to love your brother and enemy, regardless. Your emotions and lust for the better life is a sin. Passing judgment is nearly impossible. I confessed my sins. I'm not evil, god, and you know that. Ah, did I hear the magic word, confession? I think it's up to the panel to decide. We've reached a verdict. And? Tell me it's good. Guilty. What? I'm sorry, speedopoulos. This is absurd! I paid my dues! At least I was sincere in apologizing. You're telling me there's no room for redemption? Face it, clown. You failed! Sorry, George. Life is cruel, and so is god. Sucker! So this is it... A buck or more. Will you turn around, kindly? You will find two glasses, both red in color, yet vastly different tastes and outcomes. This is not a game, god. Pay attention, George. This is your one chance to escape this nightmare. Keep talkin'. One glass represents the blood of my son, Christ. If you choose correctly, you will be resurrected back to earth. The second glass is the one that belongs to the fallen angel. The devil. Yes. He has a right to your soul as well. You have not passed judgment, nor have you failed it. This is the tiebreaker, my boy. If you choose wisely, you will leave dollgatory. God, I've learned from my mistakes. I promise you... I won't do bad things again. Then fate will lead you to the correct glass. Best of luck, my child. I'm sure I will see you again. Okay... No messin' around. Either it's redemption... Or I get a tail shooting out my ass. Mom always said that the left side of the body represented the devil, and the right side that of Christ. How silly is that? So right it is. No, wait. It could be a trap. Maybe it just appears that the that left is the bad side because in this situation the right side is the wrong one because it's the obvious choice. So left it is. George, stop laying eggs and just pick the right one. See ya' in... Who knows where. Kinda tasty. But I'm still here. Well, dollgatory it is. I'm back! He's given me a second chance. So that means... I passed judgment. But what now? Who's to say I can't avoid that oncoming car? I can do this thing right. A taste of the good life. (Gina) George, you're ruining the mood! Coming! A lifetime of hell... Or an eternity of hell? I think we know the answer. Is that okay? That was fantastic. Come here, baby... You wanna play... Ruff?! Please tell me that's good. I always thought they pissed from the hole... But rumor is there's a second-- [belch] (Director) Keep goin'! Seriously?
