This is the frontispiece of the English edition from 1617. And this is the first depiction of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Picasso's Don Quixote from 1955, one of the more recent ones. The most famous one, however, by Gustav Doré, dates back to 1863. Although these three portrayals differ, they agree upon the essentials. Here's what Cervantes says: The age of our Hidalgo flirted with fifty. He was of sturdy constitution, only a bit thin, lean of face. Furthermore, he was tall with wrinkled arms and legs, a shrunken face and somewhat crooked eagle nose with a large and droopy moustache. There isn't a single word about a beard. Rather an omission than an actual proof of beardlessness. In fact, there is a passage in the second book where we can see him having his beard washed by the dutchess's maids in a joyful atmosphere instead of having it shaved. This scene, along with the fashion of the time and the portrait of the author himself speak in favour of a bearded Don Quixote. Let's follow the chronology: These popular engravings by Jacques Lagniet, which date from 1640, are seen as legitimate predecessors of comics, the only difference being the text in form of a comment instead of a dialog. On the top of the engraving, we read: Here's a present day knight being taken care of by his host and two maidens. What stands the most is the burlesque character of the situation, like this scene in which the host helps Don Quixote by pouring the drink into his mouth through a pipe because our knight refuses to remove his helmet. On the other hand, there are some shocking imprecisions, for example, Sancho being represented as tall as his master. However, we will soon discover the difference between the two. These English illustrations from 1687 are much more refined than the previous ones and focus more on the setting: Don Quixote being promoted to a knight before an inn Don Quixote tilting at windmills Don Quixote takes a flock of sheep for a marching army Don Quixote saves a convoy of prisoners And here is Don Quixote in an 18th century painting by Charles-Antoine Coypel, a history painter appointed by the Gobelins Manufactory in 1716 to make a series of twenty-five tapestry cartoons, later often reproduced by various artists. Coypel's influence was apparent throughout the century. The only ones who resisted his spell were individualists like Natoire, another author of tapestry cartoons, Gillot, sharing a similar style with Watteau, Fragonard, with his characteristic hatching and finally Goya, who sadly left us with a single drawing: Don Quixote in his Study. And since we're in Spain, let's have a quick glance at these drawings, which date back to 1780. What's most typical about them, apart from the Spanish setting, is a tendency towards liberation which paved the way for the 19th century art. Now, let's cast some light on the French romantics: in Devéria's work from 1821 or Charlet's from 1830... the lines are evidently getting more simple and bold, almost on the brink of caricature, yet failing to successfully portray a character. In 1853, a step forward was made by the painter Decamps. Here, the duo of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote forms an indivisible whole. The knight and his squire oppose and complement each other similar to two geometric shapes: a line and a circle. One represents roundness, the other straightness. Tony Johannot will base his interpretation on the very same principle. Everything is put to the service of portraying Don Quixote as a sharp, angular and scraggy character. The main objective was to exploit Don Quixote's skinniness in a comical manner. Staying true to the text, the depiction points out the essence of his structure along with his funny side. Here's an example: the 17th and 18th century editions often showed a scene with Don Quixote standing unstably on his horse while the skillful Maritorne holds him with a rope from the inn window. The moment of loss of balance is presented... when Rocinante slips away, leaving our hero hanging. Or maybe, it's better to show the aftermath of a comic situation, rather than show it happening. It's the same scene Tonny Johannot used to express the lengthiness of Don Quixote's body. However, thanks to Gustav Doré, the image of Don Quixote has changed forever. Don Quixote is finally taken seriously as the puppet makes way for the thinker. Furthermore, certain similarities with Christ are not to be neglected. This new incarnation introduces the pure thought which goes far beyond any material contingency while feeding off its own chimeras. Coming down to earth is often accompanied by humiliation, cruelty and mockery. The landscape regains its importance, becoming both fantastical and mysterious. It's unclear whether these rocks, these mountains and horizons belong to the real world or to the hero's imagination. Daumier continued his search for allegory in 28 drawings made in the final years of his career, more precisely from 1860 to 1870. Behold the work of the greatest painter who has ever dealt with this subject! No room for anecdotes. Everything is expressed in a game of lines and forms. The comic side of Don Quixote vanishes while the idealist kicks in. This can best be seen in this caricature accompanied by the following words: Here's the one who's always brave, kind, generous, imprudent... the one who gave up his spear for a quill in order to confront the banalities offending his noble soul. Salvador Dali, whose resemblance to Cervantes' hero was remarkable, was the only artist in the last century who portrayed Don Quixote free from the influence of the previous works by Doré or Daumier. Choosing the road less travelled, Don Quixote lets the fool overshadow the thinker and goes on spinning like a spinning top, which, if you take a closer look, reveals an entire army. However, this madness is called paranoia... but that's only an introduction to a form of obsessive criticism which the painter identifies with the process of the artistic creation itself. The folly of carefully calculated shots from arquebus... as well as filling rhinoceros's horns with ink... is nothing compared to the fruits of Dali's rigor brought to the point of extreme meticulousness. It's clear from these examples to what extent painting has enriched our knowledge of Cervantes' novel. On the other hand, it also impoverishes it, making us forget about the surrounding lively crowds for the sake of the main characters and the landscape. Only the early illustrators knew how to depict the crowd with precision. Everything about this crowd is important. Every secondary role has its purpose. Every character our hero crosses his path with helps us understand him better and locate him in the material (spatial) context. Every time a certain character appears on a higher ground means he's suffering from a more severe form of madness. Let's take Cardenio's example because an unrequited love made him insane and drove him to the mountains... or that of shepherdess Marcele who values her own freedom to the point of cruelty, the very same cruelty that led a young man kill himself. Taking her reasons into account, Cervantes doesn't miss the opportunity to reveal her impossible striving for purity also known as angelism. The additional stories from the first part of Don Quixote are not only digressions but also variations on the theme of the power of obsession. The story of The Curious Impertinent speaks of Anselmo, a young man from Florence, who, like Don Quixote, suffers from hypertrophied imagination manifesting itself through pathological jealousy. In order to be sure, he asks his best friend Lothario to test the fidelity of his wife Camilla. Lothario unwillingly accepts and eventually wins her heart. To remove all doubt, she plots a scene in which she fakes her own suicide while Lothario is trying to seduce her with Anselmo hiding behind a curtain. And he who doubted everything, suddenly believed everything. Another purpose of these digressions is to show that reality has in store more surprises than fiction. While Dulcinea appears as an ugly, vulgar peasant girl, a complete opposite to the person from her admirer's imagination, the women Don Quixote encounters are very beautiful, although that's not always apparent from the engravings. Take the example of Dorothy who, disguised as a shepherd, washes her feet in a brook. It's well known that Cervantes was held prisoner for six years by the Barbarians. He attempted an escape several times, which almost led him to the gallows. The story of Zoraida, a young Moorish woman who disobeys her father's will and runs away with a brave christian slave, is not more fantastic than the life of the author himself. Finally, the second part of the book, written ten years later, leads us to a disquieting thought that no one can escape the virus of Don Quixote's madness. The hero is no longer confronted with harsh reality, but with an artificial universe... like when Don Quixote encountered actors in the cart, taking their masks and costumes for their real characters... or when he unsuccessfully tried to provoke this gracious lion... or even when he slaughtered Master Peter's puppets taking them for Moors, falling victim to a perfect illusion which would deceive even the shrewdest of spectators. The barren landscapes from the beginning are transformed into a festive decor. Our lonely, gloomy Don Quixote puts away his armour and joins a company hungry for divertissement, which would later be heavily criticized by Pascal. This company jealously keeps the grain of folly, paradoxically praised by Erasmus a hundred years earlier. One of the most absurd scenes is the one with a wooden horse (Clavileno). Don Quixote and Sancho are tricked into believing they are actually flying on the horse while the assistants are simulating rushing wind and fire with special requisites. Finally, everything is going our hero's way after he's confronted with the image of himself. He's no longer striving to be Lancelot or Amadis but Don Quixote. Here lies the unique depth of this masterpiece in which reality and fiction mirror each other, endlessly exchanging their reflections. In the final chapter, Don Quixote is defeated by the Knight of the White Moon on a beach in Barcelona. This scene leaves us with an unsettling feeling not merely caused by the hero's peaceful death. Lastly, a few words about Sancho Panza whose alleged wisdom isn't but foolishness. He's a simple rather than a cultivated man, but unlike Don Quixote, his tragedy lies in turning into an idealist towards the end of the novel and paying the inevitable price for having such illusions, which is particularly evident in the bullying scene. Another case of bullying, however, this time in a figurative manner, comes in a scene in which Sancho wakes up only to find out his beloved donkey got stolen by Gines de Pasamonte. He follows his master only out of greed and hunger for governance. At some point, though, the locals name him governor, only to make fun of him. They play a thousand pranks on Sancho, his table is magnificently set, but as soon as he starts eating, doctor Pedro Recio gets the table cleared... or when they lock him in an armour in order to protect him from a fake mutiny. And yet, despite all the obstacles, he successfully fulfils his duties of a judge, while, thanks to his earthly wisdom, he keeps outsmarting the thugs better than anyone else. On all these 18th century engravings we continue to discover a baroque universe composed of various symbols and illusions. If it's true that this universe poses a threat to the image of Don Quixote, it still doesn't come without a positive side, revealing new aspects of an illusion which, for Cervantes, at the same time represents the source of and the cure for all our misfortunes. Reason will eventually deliver our hero from madness, although we are perfectly aware that there is reason in madness and madness in reason. The ambiguity which underlies the novel cannot be easily perceived at first sight. This novel should not be identified with various interpretations it inspired as it was often the case. It's a book... one of the greatest in fact... and it should be read.
