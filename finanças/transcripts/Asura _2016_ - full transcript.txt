EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG ASSOCIATE PRODUCER MICHELLE KWON PRODUCER HAN JAE-DUK I can't stand people. Annam City, where I work as a cop, is bursting with rotten people. These days, with redevelopment coming, everyone's at each other's throats. Then there's Annam's mayor, Park Sung-bae. He wants to eat up the city all by himself. Of course his opponents aren't going to stand still. Every day, it's nothing but war. As for me, I side with the winner. So our Mayor quietly gives me a call. He thinks of me as his gun dog. It's not me... it really isn't. Then who is it? Your father? Hey, are you really a minor? A senior at Anpyung Girls High School. God damn! Hold this. Stand closer. Come on. It's ringing. Read from this. Hello, it's me. - Don't whimper. - Where are you? I'm sorry, but I won't testify in the appeals trial. The information I gave to the Prosecutor before is all completely untrue. Tell the Prosecutor I'm so sorry! Wonderful. You were wonderful. I could kiss you. Mayor Park Sung-bae was almost removed from office after being indicted last August under the Public Official Election Law. But in today's appeal hearing, the High Court ruled him innocent. Incidentally, the prosecution secured a witness, but this morning he suddenly canceled plans to testify. Let's hear from Mayor Park now. The ruling by the judiciary comes as a great relief. But this attack from the prosecution, with no witness... What kind of nonsense is that? This insults the honor and pride of the 480,000 residents of Annam! He's right! Excuse me a moment. Going through. Prosecutor Oh, you gave a good effort. So do you know why the witness dropped out? No idea, maybe those lies got to his conscience. He called out of the blue and refused to testify. That's because you're shitting on the rule of law. So you think you can serve out your term? Wow, the Prosecutor issues threats? I'll take care of my term. - That's enough! - You damned prick! Sir, people are watching. Shut up! You target a popularly elected mayor? In this day and age, you thugs show off your power? - Thugs? - Sir, please let's go. Escort him out. It'll be lonely without you. You'll have to wear a suit every day. Won't it be uncomfortable? I'll give it a try. Hey, bro. In that case, go with a pearl grey suit. Go to sleep. Yes, sir. I said to call when the witness lands in the Philippines. That fat pig was freaking out, refusing to go. Had to force him on the plane. So, he arrived yesterday? He left today. I let the drugs wear off first. Today? You changed the plan? I'll take care of it! You need to trust me. At attention! Stand straight. You think you're human? You're dog shit, know that? Yes, sir. Wipe your nose. You need to take care of that witness, got it? What, you're going to count it? Oh, right. I said to wait outside. A guy about to quit goes on a stakeout, I knew it then. What brings you here? Hey Junkie! You still visit the Philippines? I stopped selling a year ago, why should I go there? Don't glare at me, dickhead! Wait, Hwang! What's wrong? Is the Mayor doing well? What? You fucker, don't take it all for yourself. I know what's going on. What are you talking about? The witness. Didn't you and him take care of it? Isn't it illegal to cuff me without saying that lawyer stuff? What did you say? Hwang, please. Just hear what I have to say. Look, if I bring him in, you think I benefit? - Okay, I get you. So let's just uncuff him... - Bro! Sergeant Hwang? Sir! What? What the hell? Hwang, wait a minute! I'll catch him! Hey Sun-mo! Hey Sun-mo! Why the fuck did he have to show up? We shouldn't touch that junkie, dammit! Shit, where is he hiding? Hey, Junkie! Junkie. I know you're out here. Look at you! What do you mean, what? There's a cop after you. Be quiet. Fucking junkie. I'm over here! Call all the cops! Shut up, you. You got him? Sun-mo... What's his problem? This bastard took drugs! Shut up! Fuck off. Freeze! Sun-mo, why'd you draw that? Put it away. Don't move. Put it away, man. "Don't move. Don't move!" Sun-mo, I'll take care of this. That stupid nutcase! You're dead! Wait, Sun-mo! What a fucked up day. You asshole! One fucker gives me work, and the other fucker chases me. Dickhead! Halt or I'll shoot, you fucker! Eat this. I know they're blank shells. These are live bullets. One move and I'll really shoot! Hey, stop. Close the valve. Couldn't you come sooner? Hey, stop! Wait a second. - We should call 911. - You got him? Let's have a look. Look at all this cash. Hwang! Let's talk this over. What's to talk about? Junkie is yours, and the money's mine, right? Sun-mo, you want a cut? Forget it! Come on, Hwang... - Let go! - Dammit! Goddamn it, you fucker! Why are you swearing at me? What, I can't swear at you? What the fuck did I do? Is telling you not to steal so wrong? You're always getting a nice tip from the mayor. How many times did I beg you for a cut? Why can't I take that money? You can and I can't? It's not your money. It's someone else's. - Then you stay out of it. - God damn you! Sun-mo, don't shoot that. I really need this. But we need to report it. Right, Han? You want to die? You think this is a joke? Have you gone mad? Let go, dammit! Why'd you hit him? You fucker! Will you fucking stop it? Fuck, stop it! Don't do it! Drop that! Stop, dammit! ASURA So you didn't know at first Sgt. Hwang had arrived. But he told us he'd assist you. I don't get that. I'm curious too, why he said that. It's not a detective's job, bringing in violent criminals. It happened so fast. I had no choice. Let's go over it once more. Again? Last time, really. On the phone his speech was slow. He's on drugs, I thought. He's dangerous when he's high. So I went out to grab him before something happened. Where am I...? You killed a cop? You really killed a cop? You dirty fuck! Stop it, Han! This is Han. We have an emergency. Officer down. Send an ambulance quickly. You're under arrest for the murder of a policeman. You have the right to remain silent, and the right to a lawyer. However sudden, couldn't three of you handle him? It's not my fault that the fence gave way. How far away were you? 4-5 meters. That junkie pushed him so hard... Doesn't the junkie have a name, idiot? Who are you calling idiot? I told you to keep quiet! - Detective Han? - Yes? We're done, you can go. Thank you. Why stare? Am I good looking? Yeah. You're quitting the police? Why? I felt like quitting. So why did you? Detective work doesn't suit me. Can't you tell me about your business with Junkie? Let's eat. It's connected to Mayor Park? Let's just throw everything in the open! So you want me to go say, "I killed him. I lied." I didn't mean it. Look me in the eye. I'm sorry. For what? What are you sorry for? I think I misunderstood. You definitely misunderstood. I couldn't help it, okay? Was it my fault? - Was it yours? - No. Let's eat. Wrapping things up here isn't easy. But if I waver, I'll be in trouble. I need to start work for the Mayor next week. I'm going to make a new start. I'm still breathing. I downloaded some TV shows for you. Should I call a nurse? Park sent money again. How much? $20,000. He sent an extra $5,000. It's hard for you, accepting money? No... Oh, I gave $800 in condolence money, okay? I feel bad for Hwang's wife. You'll feel better now... I explained it all before. Not that, something else. What? I'll ask the questions. Prosecutor's Office Turn that off. Regulations require it. - Don't record me! - We need to! You know the witness who was gonna testify against the mayor? Who? The guy who skipped out on court and disappeared! How would I know him? Because you kidnapped him and forced him to call us. Now you're just slandering. Records indicate you met him four times. You drank together, went to a motel and fucked girls... According to witness testimonies, he claimed to know a detective from West Annam station. I've never seen him before. His body was found in Malate in the Philippines. This morning. So? I'm late. You're hurting my eyes. Kim Cha-in, Gyeonggi District Prosecutor. You showed him the file. And the airport parking lot photo? That's the highlight. The witness being led by Junkie. Your informant. That night, he was beaten by you and arrested. Good, he's the jerk who killed our Sergeant. I want to skin him alive. You're famous for being sly. You act well. Threatening an honest policeman like this with no evidence... I heard you're quitting to join the Mayor's team officially? I'm not sure yet. Someone just suggested. Are you gonna keep lying? Official records show you met the Mayor 22 times. This is your resignation letter? Processing is delayed due to Hwang's case. I'll take care of this for you. What? I'll take care of it. Understand? Wouldn't that be handled by the higher-ups? I'm higher than the higher-ups. Coffee... Holy shit. Don't glare at me. Don't glare. Son of a bitch! Don't glare, little shit. Don't. Glare. Do. Not. Fucking. Glare. You asshole! Let go of me, fuck! I'll show you, fucker! Let go of me! Okay, let's just remember two things. First, you have no time. Your life ends on Nov. 20th. Second... Let him go! Before then, bring me recorded proof that Park ordered the kidnapping. Sit him upright. You committed all those crimes for Park's sake, but... even if he slips free, you never will. You know why? Because you took on all the dirty work yourself. If we investigate, you'll spend at least 3 years in jail. I'm really good at that. Why are we wasting the land vacated by the US Army? A citizen wrote on the city website, "Annam's development is blocked by the Development Committee!" and it got 500 replies! Wait a minute! What a relief that the Committee will disband this month! Mr. Mayor! If only you are going to talk, why did you call us here? He has the floor, wait for your turn. From the beginning we agreed to a business plan but who pushed for the plan to be canceled? After we spent 8 years on the development, who overturned it in a single day? Deputy Chairman, may I ask a question too? Honestly, weren't those 8 years just a power grab for you? I want a formal retraction of that statement! Stop all this! Let's just go. Noting more worth hearing. This bread tastes like shit. I don't get why you try so hard to get rid of a hardworking mayor doing his job. Mr. Mayor, I didn't expect you to be so crass. You won't give up on this New Town development! We should invite the US Army back. Don't listen to that jerk! "That jerk?" Did you just say that? At an official meeting, you should speak with respect! You all sound so scary, I went and peed my pants! Don't want to work with me? You know how much I want it. I said I'd quit at once. They said I can't leave with Hwang's case unsolved. So I said okay, I'll finish it, then quit. What's really going on? That's everything. It's making me crazy too, this mess. I like you one minute, then hate you the next... I wonder why? Things are already in motion. If you don't do it, who will? I've been worried about that too. How's Junkie? I heard he regained consciousness yesterday. Don't make things complicated. It's not like you. I'll do my best. Mr. Mayor. Secretary Eun! Let me look. It's still wet in the crotch. Dry it some more. Hey, how was that joke I made in front of everyone? Your humor had everyone in stitches! What do you mean? It wasn't everyone! - Really? - Sure. God, that guy just won't listen. Han! Are you really going to throw Junkie to the dogs? This isn't because he shot up. He killed a cop. But why pull him into this from the beginning? Didn't you come to see me? Yes. I told you we can't meet like this. You and I are enemies! I know. But after today, I think I can quit this charade. What do you mean, quit? I need you there. Those scumbags want to backstab me and eat up that $800 million deal. I think they figured me out, we'll just expose our hand. Then later if I get the construction contract, I'll be lynched from both sides. You have no trust. That makes it harder for me. I heard the opposing camp is bringing in Prosecutor Oh. Shouldn't we do something to the Supreme Prosecutor? That's what I want too! With $20 million I could stick it to them now! But you say you're out of cash! God, you drive me crazy! Talking money again! I'm out of cash, really! You know how much you spent this year? Fuck, you're annoying! So, build in just one district? How many times should I say it? For a large-scale zone we need to hold out for approval in all four districts, you stupid! I mean, if the municipality objects, we can't build at all. You're just talking tough after winning the appeal. You're not being reasonable! You need push and pull. You know nothing about politics. I'm not backing out. But the rumors about the Mayor really scare me. Don't believe rumors. If he takes you in, you know how generous he is? What's your take-home pay? $2,200 a month? Base pay's $4,000. Bonuses extra! Money money money! I'm not doing it for the money. I'm just trusting your advice, 100%. You always talk like that. Still, you're thankful, right? You fucker! "Very very thank you," for sure. What is it? You withdrew your resignation. Got yourself posted to External Affairs? Just tell me your conditions. Our office is in a quiet place. Join us from tomorrow. God, you ask a lot. Come and work hard. I'm impatient, we want the Mayor now. Not long to Nov. 20th. To stay out of jail, record something for us. Yes, sure... Over here. Everyone thought the Mayor would lose. But after he ended up being re-elected, he tried taking the development rights for himself, so the opposition closed ranks. The problem is that Tae Byung-jo is on the opposite side. Park has been funded by Tae's dirty money. Maybe they're putting on a show? That guy there should know. What scheme are Park and Tae concocting? Be straight with him. He knows you retracted your resignation. Did you record it? Why not? I was never ordered to kidnap the witness. Let's start working this bitch over. So your bright idea is to send Moon Sun-mo in your place? He said he wants to go, what can I do? You're giving it quite the effort in your cramped car. Okay, let's spill the beans. Your illegal investigation into the Mayor, I'll spread it all over the internet and on TV. Don't get excited. Sit. You have no idea how much of a prick I am. Please sit down! I'll take this to the fucking end. I don't lie. Your wife's number is 010... 3348... 4982... right? Shall I send it? Don't. What? I didn't hear you. What did you say? Please don't. Why shouldn't I? She's on her deathbed, dammit! So a guy like you, with a sick wife, fucks around? Oh my. As an apology to your wife, why don't you push 'send' yourself? - Why are you doing this? - Push it! Push it. Go ahead. Push 'send'! Push it. Push it! - Please, Prosecutor! - Push it! Push it! Push it! Push it! Push it! - Fucking hell! - Push it! Push it! Come on, tough guy. I'll record it for sure. Record what? The Mayor ordering the kidnapping. Might be faster to book him and Tae under organized crime laws. We'd need to link him to Tae. To trace their finances, we'd need the court's approval. He won't sit still. Intelligence gathering is one level above us. You might be giving him too much there. He sure can drink. Okay if I pour you one? Yes. Sir, can I ask a question? Sure, go ahead and ask. They say Park's opposition has brought in Prosecutor Oh... Then are you his lapdog? Lapdog? Those are just rumors. You call that a question, you bitch? He told me to ask, you dickhead. Step outside. - Get out here! - Sure! Both of you sit down. Hey, control yourself. Detective Han! Detectives control themselves in order to solve crimes. Us too. Let's respect and trust each other, okay? So fucking pretentious. You want to die? If you weren't a prosecutor, I'd beat you dead! Calm down! Fuck! Detective Han, I like your spirit! You're a tough one! Kiss my fat ass! Shut the fuck up! Shall I help you? I'm fine. Bruised again? Be more careful. Still popular with the ladies! He'll be up in 5 minutes. Is this that damned pearl grey? Who wears silver these days? Giorgio Armani... on sale! Look at these lines, here and here. It's tough working for him, right? He squeezes blood from a stone, he's crazy! But I really love working here. I always hated politicians, but seeing them up close, they're amazing. The way they go at each other, wow... He gives you extra on the side? I couldn't believe it! I'm gonna buy a Beamer 520. Why didn't you move her here earlier? She refused, but I moved her anyway. Wash her up, she smells! Oh, my... What's with the bruise? Why don't you lie down? Ah, that's nice! That prosecutor, was it Kim Cha-in? Studied law at a provincial school, not even a southern guy. It wouldn't be hard to squash him. You mean the special prosecutor? Our friend Tae's got so much dirty laundry, he's vulnerable. That's why I said to keep your distance from Tae. Still, he's been my guard dog for over a decade. Let's not think of the bad stuff, is my attitude. But you have to put him aside. I don't like you advising me. It sounds like you're ordering me. I was only thinking things over from your perspective. People generally don't think from other perspectives. They just think of themselves. - Except for you. - Yes, sure. I'll call you later. Oh ma'am, just a minute. I'm sorry. I was in the restroom. Hey, give him the phone. It's registered in the name of some old farmer. It's only for calls with you, me and Secretary Eun. - From now on, use that. - Yes. Four, including me! I heard you're like brothers? - Yes. - Yes. Brothers are all about honor. Yes. If I tell you to relax, and you actually do it, how far will you go in life? I'm sorry, sir! I'll do better! This kid's cute. - Let's go. - Yes. Take good care of her. Not sure she can drink this. Thank you. Han, should I kill that gangster? Mr. Tae? Will you do it? What, you refuse? You coward... I'm joking. Voice Recording 001 Delete File? Want a mini recorder to put on your clothes? I'll take care of it, dammit! Leave him alone. Remember his temper. - Want to share my rice? - Why? You look pitiful. Got a crush on me? Fuck, no. You're the worst type. You ordered Chinese? Guess you were hungry. So you let the neighborhood know about our secret base, idiots! We wanted to save time... Mr. Han! So your wife is Park's half-sister? Brothers-in-law! You spoke with him at the hospital, right? He said nothing about the witness, so how can I record it? So you have to ask him, bitch! Quiet, everyone! Yes, sir. Go ahead. What? He says to clear out. What? We're going back to the headquarters for now. Wasn't that Prosecutor Oh? He's getting pressured from above. Fuck, you're dead! Not from there. Our dear Mayor, Han's brother-in-law, shook higher up the tree. It's for the best. We'll get some rest. Let's pack up! Pack up! Pack up! Pack up! My husband won't let me see the bankbook. It doesn't matter, just circle #1. Wow, lucky Han! Rubbing shoulders at work with pretty women... Yeah, I love it here. What brings you? Something awkward's come up. That bastard Junkie just retracted his testimony. I said I didn't kill him! I didn't even know Sgt. Hwang died! How'd he die? Diabetes? Cirrhosis? We saw you push him. You rehearsed your story with Sun-mo? Are you making shit up? Looks like you're the one making shit up. Should I tell them about the fruit warehouse? Just like a druggie to start making shit up. Your voice is shaking, Detective. What the hell's he doing? That bastard! Come here, You asshole! Fuck! Calm down! Get down, you bastard! Calm down. Whoa. Han, why are you so worked up? You didn't do anything wrong. We should've had blowfish. Thought you hated $5 meals? Why'd you do that back there? I told you not to show me up. Who would believe a drug dealer? You've really lost your balls recently. Fucking bastard! Why are you swearing? Sun-mo! What did I tell you to do to survive? "Know your place, and never cross the line." "To stop at the line!" I'll take care of my own business, okay? - Sit. - I need to go. I said sit! The Mayor told you to come tomorrow. Poor folks from across the country gathered there to earn money. At first they were 5 minutes from being a dog's dinner. But in the 1980s Bundang... Annam, the 2nd Bundang was named a New City development, and now? How are they doing now? Now, it's "Bundang Above Heaven!" Wait and see what becomes of our Annam. A rich city that'll pull in all the nation's millionaires! - What kind of city? - Rich city! - I don't hear you, what city? - Rich city! I, Park Sung-bae, with these hands, will build it! You're saving for a car? Add that. Did I offend you yesterday? No, I like getting treated, asshole. Don't smirk. Put it in your wallet. Yes, sir. These days I regret making you quit the force. Why? I didn't quit because of you. Kiss my fat ass. Let's have a look at the Annam Metropolis! The Annam Metropolis! Annam Metropolis It's beautiful! Everybody get ready. So what's today's event? Mr. Tae's thugs are going to cause a scene. - Why didn't you say earlier? - When could I? I need to go. Tell me quickly, so I can help out. I can't tell you. You know the Mayor's rules. "Tell the fewest men possible!" Reporter Kim! I don't like that camera. - Hey, turn the cameras off! - Stop what you're doing. I said turn the cameras off! All of our men, stop now! - Why don't you clear this up? - Gather here, everyone. What are they doing? Why'd they stop? Tell them to start. Lose the camera. Sir, he says to hurry up. Your Mayor. Why's he always trying to bury me? Looks like he wants this on the evening news. Would you do it with these cameras? Still, please do it. Look at this crazy punk! Goddamned chicken shit! Why don't you do it, dickhead? Give me the box-cutter. You try it. You'll be good at it. Sir! Don't touch me. Please do as you promised. Han, I'm not gonna follow that lunatic's orders anymore. Let's go! Wait, Mister! You there! What's the meaning of this? Mr. Mayor! It's okay, let go of me! Let go! How can you cause such a scene? Hey, Tae! You can't go like this! Stop fighting! Don't fight! You shouldn't fight! Don't fight! Let go, you idiot! Please don't fight! Please stop fighting! Don't let them see it. Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! Out of the way! Nobody touch the Mayor! Cameras! This person did it! That person! He's the assailant! I'm okay! I, Park Sung-bae, will stand with you to the end! Park Sung-bae! Park Sung-bae! Terror Attack on Mayor Park Are we just going to stand by and watch? Who would want that? We need some kind of response. Someone didn't do his job. The local districts are in an uproar. You knew they were staging a show. I'm sorry. I told you to get him by Nov. 20th. You should step aside, as you promised. Mr. Oh, please give me a little more time. I'll lock him up for sure! Oh my... I can't aim for shit. What are you sulking about? I'm one of the team, but only I didn't know. If everyone knows, it's entertainment, not politics. No, my ears hurt. What the hell? That's all 50 bullets. I blew off some steam, anyway. Secretary Eun, so I'm on YTN News' main page? "Braver than the US Ambassador During his Attack." Who? Me? The press is going crazy! Shall we look? Han did a good job at that moment. Not at all. It's because Sun-mo backed me up. Compared to you, he's got a long way to go. Mr. Tae will arrive soon. - Mayor Park's popularity is - Might be best... - growing after the box-cutter attack... - not to provoke Tae for a while. - The prosecutors... - Han! I'm easily scared. Don't scare me more. You shouldn't give the prosecutors any foothold. Junkie is spilling the beans? Seems he admitted taking the witness to the airport. Junkie can't say anything. He took part in a murder... Don't pretend to be innocent. Heard you and Junkie had a big fight over the Hwang case. Sir, a text message about the carrier. So the fruit boxes are ready? Yes, I packed them myself. So, the Chinese gangsters... Hey cop, wait outside. I said get out. But there are so many eyes in Minpyung. Deliver it by tomorrow night. My god... I told you to come alone! An old habit. Hey, you wait here. The citizens group said that you quit. Oh my, why are you so reproachful? I just briefly lost my temper, but I've had time to reconsider. Since you announced it, maybe it's for the best? So you mean, now you've become a hero, you're gonna throw me to the dogs? That's my plan. Sorry about that. You want a word of advice? No I don't. I'm sick of advice. I don't give you advice either. No more money from thugs, I'm gonna do clean politics. You spend so much time trying to backstab people, You don't even know if you're a mayor or a crook. All right, asshole! From now on, I'll join the opposition for real. Try using that damned brain of yours, or you might end up dead. Secretary Eun! Mr. Tae is leaving. I'm not done talking. Park, stay there, asshole! Give me the gun. Gun? Give me that thing. - Hurry! - There are no bullets. Get over here, fuckhead. I'll skin you alive. It's okay. Calm down. Just be quiet! What? You gonna stab me with that? Fuck yeah, you think I won't? That's all you know how to do? Hey thugs, get out! Thugs? - You think you're a politician? - Get out! Don't you move! What if someone got hurt? Get out. Did you see it? - Get out! - I did it myself! Is he dead? Is he? He's still alive. Fuck! I can do it too, asshole! Hands off him! Hands off him, you! Get the fuck out. Get up. - Are you okay? - Yes. - You're not hurt? - No. I like crazy bastards like him. You're a real man, Sun-mo. Come on. What really happened is, they were fighting, the two of them. And I was passed out here. Lying here, passed out cold! Why won't the Mayor answer my calls? Those are his orders? Just assume so. Do you really have to ask? Don't be rude. That can get you killed. Yes sir. Any response from Tae's gang? Add some bodyguards, and be alert. How is your wife? Is she improving? Don't be cocky. Do you even know what you're doing? Fuck, you're annoying. Always talking down to me. You're still just a kid. I spent last night drinking with the Mayor, and he said he wanted to be a lifelong partner to this kid. So? Just letting you know. After crushing Tae, you think you're something? You told me to go earn respect so I tried harder than anyone, is that so wrong? Did I tell you to go berserk? Did I? Han. If you're jealous, you lose! You motherfucker! What are you two doing? You're the reason we're doing this reenactment! Did you come to play? I'm working my ass off here. I hear rumors you're going around meeting prosecutors. Is it true? I guess so. I'd better report it to the Mayor. Will you do it yourself? Han, please... Don't act like an idiot. People are jumping up in all directions to shield Park. Secretary Eun's phone goes dead after hours. I wonder if maybe you gave him a hint. Mayor Park bumped off Tae Byungjo on Saturday. A change of heart? - You're listening? - Yes. - Check on Tae and report back. - Yes, sir. Park will be in trouble without cash. Where will he get his money? How far do I have to help before my job here ends? It ends at the end. I'm the bait. Don't you let me go after catching the big fish? Is that why you're recording this? You told me to record everything. I'm Kim Cha-in, Special Prosecutor. Case number 2016-6359. If Han Dokyung provides us with crucial information... Put it in writing. Depends on the quality of the info. Secretary Eun is on record calling Minpyung? You all listening? Location and content of call. What am I saying? Am I making a mistake? Shit, I don't know. No, this is right. No regrets. Is something bothering you these days? No. Then why act like a nice husband? I am nice. I like it. After all the bad things you've done. Use this for my funeral portrait. You're not going to die. When you get out, let's go to Phuket. Don't cry if I die. Since you're a bad guy Yun-hee! This bed is like a hell. I'll get surgery as you wish, then die. Don't do anything bad. You know I'll be punished for it? Did you find Secretary Eun? Follow me. I brought Han. We're going to have to go in there ourselves. Did you find anything? Yes, this man wearing the hat. Looks like Secretary Eun. I'll go inside. Hey, with those clothes you'll stand out. I'll go. Attach the camera. You'll stand out too. Han would be better. You think I'm insane? I'll just go. Come on! You said you're bait! Go catch a fish. What do you expect? So I announce I'm a spy, and blow myself up? Go catch him. Bring him back. If it's Secretary Eun, call us. Keep your promise to me. Haven't we built up enough trust? The way you act, I don't trust shit. Here's your trust. It's a copy, you keep it. Your arrest warrant has been extended. Are you really giving him an exemption? There's no such thing in Korea. Don't you know that? So why put in writing? I'll handle it. Out of the way. Hey son of a bitch. Who the hell are you? Think this is your backyard? Who the fuck are you? He's a cop! What are you staring at? He doesn't know anything. What doesn't he know? You're a cop? Give me a break! Idiot, I'm a policeman. Secretary Eun! Kancha, stop! Don't move! Bastards, I'm gonna shoot you. Come here, you prick! You fucker! Han! I know this guy. Let him go, okay? This isn't a toy! It's a real gun. Please Han, I beg you. Let him go. You fuckers are all dead! The Mayor doesn't approve of this. You know that. If he finds out, we're in trouble. Did you know that prosecutors are outside? What? I recognized one of them. Really? No, don't! You're dead! Give me my gun back! Stop this! Get us out of here first. You know where's beltway? You heard of the beltway? You need to hurry! Go, hurry! Stop! You need to go! What's that? Do we have to follow it? Eun's making a call! He's going out the back. Someone's coming. Everyone move! Are you here? Where, in the alley? That's Eun! Stop! Get him! Han, what happened? Did you meet Eun? What? Where's my gun? What gun? Where are those bastards? I need to catch them! Han! Out of the way! Where are these fuckers? Give me my gun, you fuckers! Fuck you! You want a piece of me? You bastards, pull over! Are you kidding? Give me my gun!!! Fuck! You're shooting at me? Really? You're fucking dead! Let's all die together! You asshole, where's my gun? What the fuck? Hey, you bastards deliver meth? Stop there, you! In an unprecedented accident, 20,000 residents of Pangyo were almost exposed to methamphetamine smoke. At 10pm on Annam Beltway, a van skidded on the wet road, causing a 4-car accident. Even more shocking, contained within the overturned van was $30 million worth of methamphetamine... You served as Park's secretary for 20 years? But you ran a $30 million drug business on your own? Park ordered it, right? The Mayor must be angry? No, he seems relaxed. He'll just ask you a few questions. What questions? You met that damned prosecutor? If so I'd have told you! Don't you know me? Forget it. Just don't tell the Mayor anything unpleasant. You think I would? Let's look at it objectively. You think this drug incident will just blow over? Huh? You're making me laugh. You wouldn't know, but the Mayor has been the prosecution's #1 target. There's no way out this time! So you should slip out of there quickly and go abroad or... Stupid fucker! Right, I'm talking about you. Fuck. Hey, Sun-mo. If you wear a suit and drive a foreign car, is life so beautiful? Don't you betray the Mayor. If you of all people do that, you're just dogshit. I don't understand why you're so eager to be his gun dog. Then don't! I don't care if you understand. US Army Base Redevelopment Site You've been meeting prosecutors for a month? Why didn't you tell me? You forgot? I was being investigated for the murder of the trial witness. This one prosecutor was on my back, but your name never came up. Really? They asked about the witness, but my name never came up? Not at all. It really hurts to think that you backstabbed me. How can a dog bite its master? I heard it wasn't Junkie who killed Hwang? If the prosecutor ties you and me to the witness' murder, you think I'll be in danger? Fuck no! It's just a passing storm. However strong the wind, I won't be toppled! That ordeal will only make me stronger! But I'll get pounded! Of course! But I won't let you get hurt. Why not? Because you're one of mine. I'm going to smooth things over. You'll help me? Yes, sir. - Look over here please. - Mr. Eun! Fuck no! - The Mayor is doing well? - Yes. Stop the car. Mr. Eun fell out. Bro, it's me. Everything's taken care of. Don't call for a while. Suspect in Drug Case Commits Suicide What I mean is... I think we should operate one last time. Don't let the interns practice on her this time. You requested this surgery! I told you there's no hope... So do it right! I'll pay, damn it. Whatever criticism, I won't try to avoid it. If I face the rod, I fully accept the beating. Please save her, okay? Today, being able to stand in good conscience before you... It makes my heart overflow. Fuck all of them! If everything in the papers was true, this country would have collapsed ages ago. Sit. I'll stand. I said sit! This immunity document you gave me... Turns out it's a worthless piece of paper! I listened to the recording you made with Park. But after being edited, there's nothing we can use! Why is it always this way? You need to guarantee my safety 100%! Then I can record it properly! If I'm going down with him, why should I risk my life? What the fuck is this? Something really fun. Do you realize that I'm your damned savior? Sit. I thought you'd understand if I treated you fairly. Goddammit! My mistake. Sorry. I was too humane! There'll be no more of that. You're too scared of Park to catch him! What is this? Take it off! You know your boss was bribed! You just follow orders like me, so why do this to me? Take this thing off! Do it now. What! Don't fucking do it! Stay still. Hold him tight. Enough. You know what I hate the most? Who knows? Go ask your fucking mother. Running off at the mouth. Especially to my face. Careful not to hurt your fists. Hold him. Let go. Undo the cuffs. Tissues! Let me go. Let me go, dammit! You guys fight on your own. Come on, put him back! Chief. If we don't catch Park, this will never end. You want to keep living in this hell? Prosecutor... Won't you let me stop? Bring evidence of Park ordering murders of Eun, Tae and the witness! I really can't take anymore. So your dying wife can take an ambulance to visit you in jail. Don't talk like that about my wife! Han, just stay still a minute. Wet wipes. Get a chair. What the heck did you do? You feel upset... and in pain? Yeah. So, I'll give you one last chance. My cop's intuition tells me however hard I try, I'll never get out of this hell. I've been nothing but a terrible husband. I'm sorry, Yun-hee. I'm really sorry. Funeral Home I'm sorry! My poor husband! Terribly sorry. Didn't expect you here. I'll just pay my respects. I understand your feelings, but you'd better go. How would you know my feelings? What are you whispering about? If you're here, come in and eat. This meat stew... It's made at one factory and delivered over the province. It's quite the delicacy. Would you believe that I visit funerals to taste it? These are the things people live for. Sun-mo! Don't stand there, sit. - Have a bite. - Yes. So Yun-hee's surgery will take longer? I told the hospital chief to assign her the best surgeon. Appreciate it. There are two kinds of sickness. One that you catch, but won't kill you. And one that will kill you for sure. You catch my meaning? They say there's no hope. Just think you've done your best as a husband. Your words are a bit rude. No feeling to them. Did you come to pay respects, or to get drunk? Stop being so fucking patronizing. You may just do it for your image, but she's your half-sister! Yun-hee is still alive. That's why I do all your dirty work. Doesn't that make it even? That's why I kidnapped the witness for you. Shut the fuck up. Bro! I've lost my appetite. When do I die? Why are you so hilarious today? Just tell me if I live or die. Everyone dies, when the time comes. Did Secretary Eun know he was going to die? Han, stop talking like that. Don't provoke him, you fucking idiot. Seems to me Han is doing well. Tell him to ask about Tae. His talk is making me nervous. Let's trust him. Hey, Han. The Prosecutor trusts you, but I don't. So don't fuck it up. Will you all fucking shut up? I'll handle it, so stop interfering. Who the hell are you talking to? Prosecutor Kim Cha-in. We're screwed. Let's wrap up. Han, get the fuck out of there now! - Get out there, bitch! - Wait. If he wanted to speak to Park, he would do this discreetly. Why does he talk so we can hear? From now on I'll repeat what I hear in my ear. I'm Special Prosecutor Kim Cha-in. Through the bugs we planted, we now have solid evidence of the murders of Eun and Junkie, and the transport of drugs. That prosecutor is a dimwitted sleaze! He doesn't know illegally acquired evidence is void in court? First we'll send audio files to the top 3 newspapers. If they pass, we'll spread it all over the internet. We're going to burn you alive. We're all going down together? The young prosecutor's got some spirit. He's outside now. I'm dumbstruck. Hey, drive away! Get out! Duck! - Everyone get out! - Don't make a sound. I know you're in there! Should we call for backup? Don't panic! Hey, shoot everything! Everything recorded here will be submitted as evidence. We'll shoot everything! Sir, don't come out for any reason. Seung-mi stay here. What the hell? Shut that off. Stand up. You bitch! Don't let a single person leave! We're investigators from the District Prosecutor's. I'm calling to report illegal wiretapping of the Annam Mayor. Send the police to the funeral home parking lot. Moon Sun-mo. Don't be fresh. We'll cuff you all. They're carrying weapons too. They say they're public servants, but there's a group of them. Get here in 5 minutes. What did that son of a bitch say? Can you get there in 5 minutes? Let's go. You put bugs and cameras on a popularly-elected mayor, and thought you'd get away with it? I promise you Kim Cha-in, you're going down this time. Hey, any reply? Prosecutor, say something. Han, what are you doing? Are you blowing yourself up? He wants to meet you, man to man. He wants me to go in there? Trying to be clever with an inadequate brain. This is driving me crazy. I just thought of something. He's inside. Nice to meet you! Have you tried the meat stew? Then you haven't paid respects to Secretary Eun? Oh my, there's no one on earth as shameless as our Mayor. Bitch, I'm going to crush you like a bug. What's the point of spilling blood? Why don't the two of you talk things over? Wow, look at that glare. There are two kinds of people. Bastards who hear reason. And bastard numbskulls who however much you explain, don't listen. What kind of bastard is our Prosecutor? Hope you're not a bastard to spout long prologues full of nonsense. I hope these sort of things won't be used to torment public servants! We're all busy men, how about we speak openly? Sir, you shouldn't get mixed up in this. What do you mean, mixed up? We're just going to talk. You go outside. Good! What's your price? I'd like to just buy you. You're a public servant too, you know my salary. I'm cheap. All I want is testimony that you ordered people killed. Really? That's more important than money? Show me a man on earth who doesn't like money! I've done my research too. Your boss, Chief Prosecutor Oh takes money from everyone! Mayor Park will not just roll over. Even if I go down, I'll take everyone with me! You sure talk big. Our Mayor is as grandiose as advertised! Life is damn short, we should live honestly. Honestly, how much did you figure to buy me for? I'm curious about the figure. It starts with a 5. Then some zeroes... Oh, gosh. I should have introduced you earlier. I knew you'd get along. You damned jackal! You're on my nerves today! If you get your price, you'll be thankful to me. You deserve a fee for introductions. No, Mayor, I couldn't! Be sure to persuade the Prosecutor. This is too hard for me, I can't keep going back and forth. You two talk it over. That poor guy... Please stay inside. Son of a bitch! You can't cause a scene now. Why'd you call them? I've something to talk to you about. I'm being completely honest with you. So don't take this as a sham. Have a seat. Without Chief Prosecutor Oh, you're nothing. I could make you Chief Prosecutor or Supreme Prosecutor if I tried. As a man, wouldn't you want to be at the top one day? You say the boldest things. Did you think I'd be so easily seduced? You came here to bury me, what wouldn't I do to live? In order to win your generosity and have you save me, I need to sweeten the pot. Your eyes... are not the sort of eyes to be trusted, Mayor. You don't accept my sincerity. Such a shame. Park had no intention of persuading Kim Cha-in? Can't you read the situation? If you do something stupid, we all die. He's a prosecutor, you can't beat him! The Mayor beats everyone. Sure, because he always sacrifices someone else. Who will it be this time? You killed Eun, didn't you? I'm asking, was it you? Goddammit. Yes I did, why? You know why I'm in this rotten situation? Because of you. You convinced me! Now I've got nowhere to run. Sun-mo! He's going to keep using us all of our lives. You see the state I'm in? You want me to get killed like a dog in the Philippines? Let's get out of here, the two of us. Okay, Sun-mo? Leave them to fight each other. Kim Cha-in's not after us. You pretend to be smart but you don't know nothing! You know what the Mayor told me? "Han is a traitor. Rub him out." He was right. He wants you to do it? Don't ask me. Can you really shoot? Sure. Then shoot me, bastard! Hey! Stop! Don't move! You'll shoot me? Hey, Sun-mo. You can't shoot me. You're so naive. You think I can't? Shall I do it? Go ahead, asshole. Shoot! Let go! Shoot, you prick. I will. Pull the damn trigger. Shoot me! Let go, asshole! You son of a... Oh, fuck! I'm sorry, okay? You're sorry to me? Yes I am, fuck! You're fucking crazy. This is all because of you, you know? What should I do? Bro, don't ever trust that asshole Park. - Let go! - Hey, Sun-mo! Okay, that'll do. This was recorded with permission of the Korean court. You'll receive a summons soon. You playing tricks again? People who know the law in this country are all fuckers. Okay, let's go! Out of the way. Move. - What is this? - Come out, sir. - Let's go, quick. - Prosecutor. Let's go... Stick together. Park, if you do this to a prosecutor, it's life in prison! Get your gun. You thought you were smart, but you didn't think it through. We can just tell them to cut off one of my arms. You know the forced eviction of foreigners on Minpyung? The guys who lived there have come to commit terror against me. Are you insane? Huh? But you just happened to be here today, sorry! No warning shots. Just fire. What is this prick saying? Shoot. Don't be afraid. Do it! What do we do? You fool. Fuck. What should I do? You really shot me? You'll be okay, you won't die. Bro. I'm fucked, right? No, you bastard. I'll save you, I promise. Kiss my fat ass... Sun-mo... Goddamn you... God, I'm so tired. Get out here, fat ass! Stop hitting me. Stop. I'm a Korean prosecutor! On your knees, prick! Sir, I've made a grave mistake. Okay good. Let's shake hands. Take your hand away before I cut it off! Put it down. Now you can feel my sincerity? Mayor, isn't there such a thing as a last chance? Hell no. Hey Kim Cha-in, watch this. My arm. Hey! Cut off my arm. What? Cut off my arm, fucker! Grab it! Grab it! Sir... Gimme that. Hold properly, damn it. Watch this, Kim Cha-in! Mayor! Mayor. Why are you wounding yourself? I'll be completely loyal to you. I swear! I'm not saying it to save myself. You keep your arm. And Annam Metropolis. Loyal... Let's see if you can become one of my people. You finish her off. Finish it... Record this with your camera. Okay, the camera is running. Sir... Mayor. Do I have your word? Good! That bitch's crying is getting on my nerves, finish her off! - Who is it? - Han Do-kyung. Han, is that you? Did your talk with Sun-mo go badly? Yeah... I killed him. Oh my, look what's happened because of you! You were like brothers. And the prosecutor! Sir, come on out. You're going to kill me too? Wow, you're a real monster! Park Sung-bae, get out here! Get out there! Go! What now? You're out of bullets! I'm going to kill you! With what? How will you kill me? Don't touch, you prick. Listen to me. Watch how I clean up here. You madman. Miss! Where did you go, sweetie? Where are you? There you are. Alright... Hey, Park Sung-bae! Let's fight, fucker. Who do you think you're dealing with? I want to kill you, but you'll have so much work to do. Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance! I need an ambulance. Prosecutor Kim. Listen up. We need to think of a way to clean up this mess. Please call an ambulance! Gently! Gently! You pig. I've been shot! I've been shot... I've thought up a story. Han there was found to be Sgt. Hwang's killer, and so he went crazy. So you got shot, and I'm a victim too? If you call an ambulance now, I'll support you. Okay? Now I can see you're just like me. You're so annoying. You scared me. You know what your problem is? Yeah, I got lots of problems. I know. Little guy like you has such a big temper. Kiss my fat ass, sucker! I knew this would happen. But... it couldn't be helped.
