Subtitles by explosiveskull Uh, yeah. I'll put you through. Thanks. Bye. Hi. My name's Ali Dresden. Uh, yeah. You can have a seat over there. Won't be long. Fill that out. Thank you. Shhh. What? You know, scratching it is just gonna make it worse. You gotta slap it. Ali Dresden? You stay here. Okay. Thank you so much. She'll see you right away. Third door on your right. Give me the form. You didn't put his age here. Address? We don't have one at the moment. - What's his father's name? - My boyfriend Evan adopted him. Is he a legal guardian? Not with, like, the courts and stuff, no. Do you have records of his vaccinations? Not on me. Uh, does he have a CPS case number? What's that? We can't put your kid in foster care or a group home without going through CPS. It means he's gotta be reported for either abuse or neglect. Yeah, no, I already told you, we just need something... temporary. Just a place for him to hang out for the rest of the month. Nothing permanent. Is there someone in your family who can help you with that? We can go ahead and arrange for an appointment with a counsellor for you and arrange for him to have a physical. Yeah, no, I, I... We don't need none of this. - This form will give you all the information you need. - Okay. If you need anything... Uh-huh. Oh, one second, one second. Miss, your kid just left. He knows how to get home. Oh! Ow. - Mm. - Are you happy now? - Mmm? Yeah? What you gonna do? - What? - I have to be there by 1:30, and you gotta get Bone, baby. Baby, we need to go. It's just so good. - Then you got 30 seconds. - Thirty seconds. - Mm-hmm. - To what? To do what? - One. - To do what? - Two. - Thirty seconds to do what? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10... 11, 12, 13, 14... Hey! Hey, have you seen a boy with blonde hair? Bone! Hey! I couldn't find him. Baby, I don't have time for this shit! Let's just get out of here before he shows, or I'll fuckin' kill him. - It's this one here. - Yeah. Here. And it's got a green door. Alright. - Hey, hey! - Hey. - What's going on, man? - You guys are late. - You good? - Good, man. - Hey, baby, get the box that says "Mickey" on it. - Oh. - Hey there, sugar momma! - Hi. - Can you feel that? - Uh-huh. It's climate controlled, baby. So... I was looking at a yardling too... I'd hate to see you go down early. So, basically, if you put down 1,500 now, you're gonna get double back, if not more. I'll give you 1,200 for that. Hey, where's Bone? He's in the motel, playing hide-and-seek with himself. Mick, come on, man, we gotta go. Let's get this money. Baby, will you get the phone? You doing that now? Baby, get the phone. It's in the jacket. Come on! - Argh! - Come on. Get it. It's gonna go... Hey, Sean. Hey, yeah, we're on our way now. Hello?! Hey, there was still some left! Whatever, baby. Go lick it off the door. Knew we were gonna be fucking late. You know what you did, right? - Hmm? - You know what you did. You made me look like a fucking idiot, bringing in that second box. So? It worked. Give me the money. You just gotta tell me beforehand, bring me in, so I know what you're doing. - I just don't see what the big deal is. - Baby, we're a team. Alright? Fuck it, he's not gonna come. Let's just go get Bone. Why did you do that? It's disgusting, man! Ugh! Go check the brake lights for me. - Now? - Yeah, now. I checked them five days ago. - Okay, drive! - How's it look? Go! Stop! Yeah! - See? They work, asshole! - They work? - Hey! - See ya! Evan?! Evan! Where the hell were you? Hey, hey! Chick-a chick-a chicken! Chicken! You want dinner, Bone? You want dinner? Did you get me extra-crispy? Of course I got you extra-crispy. Where you been? - Let me... - Huh? - ...go. - Dude, I can't hear you. Hey, baby. You can't let us down like you did. We missed a dropoff because of you today. Okay? And this truck has gotta be clean for pickups. How many times do I have to fuckin' tell you? I don't wanna tell you again. It's your job to make sure everything is in its fucking place. Okay? Don't run away. Baby. Baby. Baby, baby, baby. Baby. Don't fuck with me. Baby, come on. Baby. Don't fuck with me like that.

'Cause your mom is so fuckin' hot, it burns my eyes if I was gonna take them off, okay? You go into the house and make sure no one's home. Okay? Go. What? Well done. Good boy. This place is alright. And... Huh. Baby. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open. - Hey, Bone! Bone! - What? They left their barn door open, so now we got free bird food. Alright, so this is a real good bird. It's got clear eyes, and its beak here is a very well-set beak. - You see that? - Yeah. - You're gonna love this bird. It's great. - Oh! Eh, no! Don't be a pussy! Sometimes the bird gets too much shit and gunk in its eyes from all the fighting, so then you just gotta go like this. Trust me, it tastes weird at first, - but you're gonna get the hang of this, okay? - Uh-huh. Alright. The gaff. Okay? Let me show you how you put it on. That's the leg. But very important that it's tight. These are pretty amazing blades, and pretty rare to get a full set like this. - That's what you slash 'em with. - How much do I owe you? 'Cause Sean didn't let me know which rooster you guys... Dude, it's 3,000. With the gaffs, it's 3,000. I'm gonna have to go back in the house and get some more cash. - Sure. - Uh, could you... could you untie the blades? - Alright. - Do it in the tool shed, though. Bone. Shhh. Lift your legs. - So you gotta look after this bird, okay? - Yeah. You don't wanna lose him on the first fight, alright? I just wanna watch. My neighbor Boyd down the street got me all excited, you know? - Said I should check it out. - He gave you the address? - Fuck! - Yeah, uh, 3552 Perkins, right? What're you doing? What're you doing? Bone! Bone! Get up. Hey. Get up! Get up! - Come on! - See you on Friday. Man up, okay? Man up. What are you doing?! Just hold still. - Just hold still. - Hold still. Ow. Why didn't you put the bird in the cage, huh? Hey, hey, hey! Stop! You need to relax. It's okay. There. It's all done. Yeah? What are we gonna do? What did they tell you at the shelter? Just a bunch of bullshit. I told you so, baby. They... I know those places. They're just preparing kids to go to jail there. You know what? We're gonna be fine. We just gotta get enough money to get the house... and get outta here before anyone else gets hurt. You know, Bone's eight. He'll always fuck things up. That's fine. We're gonna be fine. You worry too much. From now on, we just use Bone when we need him. Okay? You missed a bit on your face. There. Don't play with your food. Are you an animal? You know what a dine-and-dash is? Me and your mom, we're gonna wait in the van. You're gonna be in here, you wait for 20 seconds. You can count to 20 seconds, right? Yeah? At 20 seconds, you look around, make sure no one's looking at you. You get up nice and slow, make sure no one's in the way. You get to the door and you run as fast as you can into the van. Alright? If you fuck it up, you go to prison. You don't wanna go to prison, right? No. Whenever you're ready. Dine-and-dash? Twenty seconds. One... two... three... - When should we give it to him? - Whenever. ...eight... nine... 10... 11... 12... So Noah starts collecting all these animals to put them on a boat. - Rats? - Yeah, even rats. And nobody believed him. Like, everybody called him stupid. - How did he choose them? - I don't know. But he put everybody inside the boat, and this storm just started blowing in, and it was like... And the boat took them to this new place, and it was somewhere safe and really cool. - Where? - I don't know, but... when Noah looked inside the boat, he saw that an animal was missing. He didn't want to follow everyone and be told how to live and where to go. Where did he go? He landed... in my bag. He's yours. Hey, Bone? You have to stay inside today. Okay? Ali, we gotta go. Bone, don't open the door to strangers, alright? I'm back home in a few days. Just give me a call. Thanks for making the time. Yeah, you can reach me at the other location. - Great. Thanks. - So number's on the card. - Alright. Goodbye. - Okay, thank you. Thanks for coming by. So, um... so Tony texted me, and he said that if we lay down seven grand by the end of the month, the place is ours. Then it's, like, a grand a month after that. Imagine. Having your own room. Just, like, fuck in our own bed. So... do you like my new restaurant? - It's alright. - You got my cut from the birds? Listen, about tomorrow. You gotta bring me in on that shit. Ah, come on. We talked about that. Bone will do it. Come on. He's not my kid. He's not my kid. They can't trace it. Listen. Just give it some time, alright? I just bought this place. So, what...?

Now get outta here before I call the cops. Hey, are... are these all yours? 'Cause we're looking for a place to stay. You hear what I said? Is one of your... dollhouses... available for the night? Jesus Christ. What fucking planet are you guys from? Hey. Clean shit. Mobile homes are stupid. You know, they're like... Playmobil houses. They're just all plastic-made and shitty. It's built beautifully, just like any other house. Next to where I grew up, all these houses... were always being blown down by hurricanes. Well, I've had this one for six years. It doesn't have a single crack in it. Use more of that. Well, I guess it's just not really my idea of a home. It's a house. A home is... what you build inside of it. Hey, Bone. So what do you guys do when you're not, uh, hijacking people's houses? We sell and transport things. Animals, mainly. - Hmm. Is that legal? - Depends which animal. - Hey, Sondra. - Hey. - This is, uh... - Ali, yeah. - Hey. This was on my door this morning. Third one in a month. - It's bullshit. - Yeah.

Yes, you do! - What are you still doing here? - It was a late morning. I was just getting started. Seriously, what's your plan? Can I use your Internet? The Internet in the office is down. Look, I'm... I'm running into town to do some errands if you... wanna come see when your bus leaves or something. Okay. - Here you go. I didn't know how you took it. - Thanks. Buses aren't running because of the storm. Uh, it's alright. I'll figure it out Well, first one you're gonna get is in the morning, so you might as well stay another night. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sure. This is so heavy! I can't... You're holding it tight. You're gonna hurt it. - Wait! - Oh, shit! At the time, I was just drinking and taking acid, just for fun, right? You were living at the park then? - No. I was like in, uh... Santa Fe. - Doesn't make a difference. No, it does make a difference. The sky was so beautiful there! And, um...

We love it! - What? Acid keeps you young. There's things that you see with your eyes that your mind tells you that you did not see. You know, think about it. Right? He's gonna fall!

You miss him? Hmm? Do you think that I could get a job around here? Doing what? What do you do when you don't get what you want? A headbutt. It's painful. It's not like I'd crack your skull, though. Lost all sensitivity here. I lost all sensitivity here. And maybe... maybe a bit here. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Not like this. Not like this. Huh? I'm putting you to work tomorrow.

Uh, let me roll! I can drive if you're tired. I'm good. You can't drive this. I've driven trucks before. This is more like flying a plane than driving a truck, okay? - I'm telling you. - Okay. Hey! Good to see you again! Hey. Ali, here... mini tour. It's all getting set up. That's nice - closet space. That's the master bedroom at the back there. Kids' bedroom. Take a look at that.

Y'know, he, uh... he was on probation. I got him a job at the factory and now he's got a... steady paycheck. He's got two kids, y'know, but everything's sorted. Why are you telling me all of this? Y'know... make sure that, uh, Bone's taken care of. Rob did this? We could get a house like this one. What do you think? - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah, thanks! - Thanks a lot. Sit down, guys!

Ah-yah! Ah! The ceiling! Off the ceiling! Boom! Boom! I'm back! - Hey. You seen Bone anywhere? - No, I was with a client. You start putting up that wallpaper? - Yeah. - Good. I might have some more work for you. You okay? Mm-hmm. Let me know when you're finished in the living room. Throw it at him! I'm gonna throw it at you! Come on, don't be a pussy. Grab it! Stupid, man. Don't drop him! Hey. I saw Evan's truck and I think he's here. And if you see him, you need to run, you come find me. You don't let him see you, you don't talk to him, okay? And if anybody asks, we're not here anymore. - Yeah. - Can you come here? - Do you like it here? - Yeah. So can you do as I say and listen to me? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna keep going... until either I break, or your fucking window breaks! Why didn't you come back? Why'd you leave me? I went out of my fucking mind. Thought I was never gonna fuckin' see you again. You know, I ended up paying some... fat fuck $200? Gave me the address of this place and another place. I drove up to this shithole. You really like it here? Feels like living in a matchbox. You don't think? Whoo. So, what, you working for this guy? Yeah, it's not bad. You know, I got a plan for how we can all be together. You know that. Bone and I will be fine here. I'm so fuckin' hungry. - I can make you change your mind. - My mind is great as it is. We should just start again. - We got off on the wrong track. I'm gonna rewind this. - No. One second. Mind if I sit here? You look way too young to be at a bar. Mm. Who's the father? Huh? Pregnant women, they shouldn't drink like that. - I'm special. - You're special. - That's what I always liked about you. - You don't know me. - Uh-huh. - How do you know that I'm pregnant?

You just gonna go back to that guy? This place is nice. Okay, so this one's already been sold. - I'm gonna deliver it tomorrow. - Okay. - You can put a proper house here. - Oh, okay. Make some more rent. But I did hook up the, uh... the water and electric systems, so you can, uh... - Robert! Robert. Who's this? - Oh. Ah, okay. Come with me. - Fuck. - Uh... lemme explain. She's a cousin from out of town, she... just needed a place to crash for a couple of nights. Robert, I'm not happy about this, okay? I gotta go. We'll talk about this later. Hey! This is so... fucked up! I'm trying to get that guy to keep us here, and now he thinks I'm charging extra rent. I see that guy around here again, I'm gonna crack his fucking skull. Is that clear? You're free to live anywhere else. Yeah, I wanna live with you... in a place of our own. Evan, that's not realistic. Is that not realistic? Back there? Yeah, but it's not ours. Baby, I can't do this without you and Bone. Okay? This is our opportunity. We gotta fuckin' move fast. You gotta go and get the keys. I'll go to the diner and I will wait, and I will meet you in the parking lot. I fuckin' follow, I make sure everything's alright. Okay? We get the house. We get Bone. It's that fucking simple. Okay? We did it with the birds, we're just gonna do it with the fuckin' house. Baby, this guy's got 10 fucking houses, right?! He's not gonna fuckin' miss it! Baby, it's people like us! It's me and you!

It doesn't have to fucking make sense. I'll help you do it. Uh... What are you doing here? I'm sorry, Rob. It's... it's gonna be okay. You sure you wanna sleep in here? Alright, everybody, get up!

They caught their bus. They made it. - Alright. Yep. - Alright? - Excellent. ...390 from Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Albany, Burlington... Someone told me this story when I was pregnant with you and I didn't know what I was gonna do. There was once... this king... I forget what his name was, but... he had this problem, 'cause there were... two women, and... they were both claiming to be the mother... of this... baby, but nobody knew who the real mother was. How could there be two mothers? Well, one of the women had a child who died, so she was claiming to be the mother of the child who was still alive. Why would she do that? Because she missed her kid. People... do funny things when... they miss someone who they know is... gone forever, Bone. So the king asks for a sword. And he's, like: "I will... cut the child in two... so that both of you can have him." Well, then this woman screamed and she... she was like: "No!" "No, give him to her! She's the real mother!" So he gave it to the other woman? No, he gave... him to her. Because... Because a mother will do anything... to protect her child. Even if it means that she can't... be around him. That's a weird story. I want you to remember it. Gah! I'm just... I'm just so tired. You finish your pancake. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Clean up my stupid face. Here. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... Hey, kid. Your mom gave me your ticket. Your bus is about to leave. It's at Gate 2, just over there. We have someone to take care of you. Come with me. I'll walk you over. Here you go. It's the one over here. Here's your ticket. She'll make sure you get home okay. Subtitles by explosiveskull
