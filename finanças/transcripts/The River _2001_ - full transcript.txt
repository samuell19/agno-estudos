I dropped by at the store Harrison and Tuomi were giving autographs These normally cost 450 marks, but they were on sale for 299 Did you jump? -No Mom started bitching about it. Dad would have let me jump Let's hang out somewhere. But not our place They're cleaning the house The little twit is beating carpets Hey, feel like going to the square to watch the Bungy-jumpers? Kiss my ass! No way, I can smell it over here! -You're so dumb! Doesn't that girl live in the same tenements as you? Look Yup. Building B. Her name is Anne. Or Anni Last name Kuvaja. In B 11 Or Annelee. Or Annmarie. Maybe it's just Anni for short Let's ride past her. Grade her butt. -No way, moron Can you see her? What the hell is she doing? Is she going to drown herself? Let's go Go get some help! -What? Wait! Wait! Anne... Hi Hey, do you remember me? Anne, I live in the same building I'm Kimmo Peltonen From Section A. Hey, come over here Help! Don't shout. Juho is scared Anne, let me take Juho Anne, let me take Juho I'll take Juho and put him right there, close to you Anne, let me take Juho Wait right where you are Anne, come here Santtu! Santtu! Have any plans for tonight? I'm on my way to do the Bungy! Mikko bet a bottle of Vodka that I wouldn't have the nerve I have a bandy game at one o'clock Then I'll stay and watch the basketball game And later tonight? -Haven't made any plans I'm having a party tonight. Feel like coming? Around seven I wanted to ask you at the Galaxy last night, but you left so early I don't mean it's a date or anything Or in a way, maybe... Say yes, will you? Who else have you asked? -Everybody. Or... all our friends I was going to grab a few beers with the guys to open the Fall season You could do it here O.K. I'll call if I can't make it Hi Santtu! -I came to return the CDs Great. -Can I come in? I was just leaving for my uncle's 60th birthday party Just for a few minutes? I'm meeting Mikko at the square soon. I'm going to do the Bungy-jump I've got a game at one o'clock Three more points, and I'll be on top of the score list Take your shoes off so you don't mess up the carpet I'm taking the "miscomprehension exams" next week Swedish on Monday, Wednesday English and German on Friday You can just leave them over there. -I remember where I took them from If I pass, I'll graduate before Christmas And then you're off to become a man I decided to ask for a deferment I need to study for the business school exam in the spring And I could also get a job at the mill Doing the same work as last summer As daddy's little helper Let me help I've really missed you Yesterday you wouldn't even say hello. - I was going to, really I was tired and all that smoke made my eyes hurt I see All that smoke made your eyes hurt? So it wasn't because all your friends were there? Eero, could we get together tomorrow? You didn't drop by or call for three weeks I was sure you didn't want to see me anymore I do want to see you. I'm just so wrapped up in the exams I could see you tonight. I'll be out of town on a gig all next week I'm picking up Kaisa from the 11.55 bus. We'll come here after the party Kaisa is staying over tonight. You'd get a chance to meet her I have plans for tonight Forget about it, then Should I leave first? -Go I'll count to twenty and sneak out then Wait! Dad can't make it to the game Ilpo Lammi is out sick. -What? Dad has to fill in for him He has to work tomorrow as well. -Well, what can you do Wait. I'll walk with you to the store. - Mikko is waiting for me at the square I'm doing the jump at ten to twelve I'm not too pleased about it. And just because of a stupid bet It's perfectly safe That lady's going first, then you. You have to sign in Looks like someone's getting cold feet Not at all. -Go ahead, admit it Read that and sign down there God, what a hangover. I hope I'm not going to puke when I get up there And it's not just me. Pate called to tell he's not going to make it And I have doubts about Make and Tero So I'm the only one here in jumping trim? We have to win to stay in the lead. - Of the whimpy hospital team I got booted from the Galaxy last night I can't really remember, but I think they banned me for two months Serves you right. You were totally plastered Did you pass out or what? -Hey, when did I ever pass out? That fucking DJ queen started getting on my nerves Never plays anything you ask him for. He needed a good flogging His name is Eero Whose? That faggot's? The DJ's. What did you do to him? -Do you know that freak? Yes, I do. What did you do to him? -I didn't know he was your friend Tell me! What did you do to him? I didn't have enough time to do anything As far as I remember... The doormen came over and... If we're staying for the game, let's go to the liquor store after we've jumped Johanna's party tonight is a "must" with capital M I'm not jumping! You can't chicken out now. In a few minutes it'll be over Who's next? -It's his turn! I fucking knew it. Santeri Korpela doesn't have the guts! Then I'll go twice... And you owe me a bottle of vodka! Hey, aren't you staying to watch?! Are you staying late at the party? -No I could drop by later You're absolutely sure now? -I wouldn't have come if I weren't I have to ask Kaisa if it's O.K Wow, a real welcoming committee. I thought mom was coming Olli's Birthday party turned into quite a hassle So you must be Santeri. Eero talks about you all the time Santeri's coming over tonight. Is it O.K? Sure. I'll stay home tonight. -That's not what I meant I can go home tonight. -No need to make sacrifices for me Have a nice night! Maybe tomorrow would be better. -Come whenever it's good for you Esa? Esa! How's it spelled? If it's with a C and one A, it means pig Like it's pronounced. One K and two As Does it have anything to do with forest industries? Paper refinery? What? -"Kaarne". Commonly known as Team A answers passive. -I think we'll answer "veltta" What the hell is "veltta"? "Kaarne" means "raven" And "veltta" means "plow", from "vält" in Swedish Hey, it's a fact "Kaarne" is a fucking raven! -I said it's a fact What an engineer doesn't know is not worth knowing Or what do you say, Pete? Could you lend me hundred? I can't make it to the gig otherwise Ask mommy and daddy for your allowance I can't today. My father's having his 60th birthday party You already owe me a thou. -O.K. I'll hitchhike Maybe I'll make it in time Don't be childish. I'll lend you the hundred You'll pay me back next week Everything you owe me. -Sure Beat them good, twit! -Go to hell, retard! Honey, could you set these out as ashtrays Leave them over there. I'll set out the chairs first The currants give a lousy crop. So damned many old branches They need to be pruned. -You're not pruning them today What? -I said you're not pruning them today Out of shape, young man? Your face is as red as a pig's ass No watering holes on the last stage. -So you made it, after all The old man's been asking about you. -Is that Audi yours? It's Hannu's company car. -We changed to a new one last week So the cyber business is booming? -We just hired two more designers Sealed a contract with Rautpohja Inc. Hold, hold, hold! You didn't bring your girlfriend? -Which one? The blonde you brought last winter. What was her name... Krisse The violin player No. That was another little outing her husband wasn't thrilled about You have a whole spectacle planned for the old man? Even the flag's flying in the pole The coordinating committee is inside. -And here sits the church choir I was expecting you sooner The reception starts at one but some guests may come early Doesn't that leave us a whole hour? Mom, I'm feeling really thirsty. - Thirsty. Now is that so? I've got to get a beer, or else I won't play a single tune You can get one from the fridge Esa, you're playing... your first set at one thirty First just a couple of songs Then a few more every twenty minutes or so. Leaves time for the speeches See that Olli doesn't steal the show Especially when his choir buddies arrive Raili, what time are they coming? Wasn't it two thirty? The factory crowd will be the last to arrive. At five o'clock They've booked a sauna at the factory villa Your father wants you to play there I put a list for song requests on the gift table Jesus, I'm not a monkey with a juke-box I'll play what I play and how Anyway, I have to leave at three thirty. - You told me you had no plans! We have a gig in Jyväskylä Dad's going to be very disappointed I don't sell the gigs. I'm taking a shower Would the old man lend me a shirt? - He went downstairs to shave I'll bring you a shirt. Tell him to hurry up We also need some time to get into party gear Mom, can I see you for a minute? - I'll set out this cake first Would you play me the "Nickel Coin"? It has such a funny chorus Dad? Dad? So how much do you need? I have a couple of rents due. We haven't had any gigs for a while A few thousand. Maybe five Listen, I put so much money into the party I can't spare anything until the end of the month Ah, well. Too late by then. I got an eviction notice I simply don't have any When are you going to learn to stand on your own feet? And I won't let you spoil dad's party! Promise me you won't ask him for money Yeah, yeah, I promise Mom. -Yes? Your guarding tactics have failed. Ulla! Olli has drunk a bottle of wine here. -Where did he get it from? One bottle isn't going to break him. He'll just start singing... I can't be with you this evening... O.K. I should start getting along Good. I've had enough of you and your wise-cracks Hannu! We've been getting rabbits here. The apple seedlings should be covered They've nibbled a whole trunk to pieces Did you see where Olli went? He cut through the neighbor's yard and got a taxi He's taking his pool coupons to the store Fucking, fucking hell! So much for the party, then Hannu and I will find him, whatever it takes The old man's probably totally shitfaced by now Krista! We're heading home! Hannu, hey. You're coming with me. I know where to look Esa, you stay out of this. You just go on that gig of yours Hannu will straighten things out. -I'm just trying to help Remember what you promised? - Of course I do Are you getting off at the bus station? I'm not leaving until we find the old man Although it would be easier to just let him be If he wants to get wasted, who's going to stop him Always the same old story Where are you guys heading? -To try out our luck in the lottery Could you bring me some trunk covers? Two brown ones, sixty centimeters should be enough I've got money. - I'll pay for them It's the best gift I can give Olli. He already has so much junk Go put on your suit for the party. -It's not my party Light me one too Don't tell Krista. I don't really smoke anymore Watch out! -What the fuck?! Shit, you almost crashed! -Bullshit! He's had an accident and you nearly butchered him His chains had come apart, that's all. -How could you have seen that? I've always seen more than you. -What's that supposed to mean? Drive to the shore! A girl's trying to drown herself We're going to have a baby. Krista's three months pregnant So I'm going to be an uncle The estimated date is March 25. We're going for an ultrasonic next week To find out if it's a Gary or a Mary. -I can't be it's real godfather But I can be its "favorite friend" That's a special certificate for those who don't belong to the Church We weren't going to bother you We though we'd announce it as a surprise present. -I see I was going to go in on your present, but I guess it won't work with a kid I could treat the old man to a Bungy I got him a pocket watch Gave it to him when we got there, said it was from both of us You owe me four hundred. -A pocket watch? A pint of Guinness. I'll sit over there in the corner Bullseye. Open the trunk for me What shape is he in? Is he coming? -I'll find out The trunk's unlocked Where do you think you're going? The longer he stays, the harder it is for him to leave Let me do my part in saving the family feast I don't care if he stays there for the rest of his life But after all that work, mom deserves to to have him there in half-decent shape I don't trust you to get him out of there It'll only take me five minutes Go and get the tree trunks in the meanwhile Aren't you tired of baby-sitting him? -Isn't that what you've been doing? When I was thirteen I told mom- that she should throw him out and get a divorce Hell, she came this close to doing so. -I never knew Yeah, like they ever bothered you with anything unpleasant You were busy graduating at the time. -What are you accusing me of? Nothing. Lassie is just trying to save the little scouts I'll be back in five minutes Give me the hundred from Kalevi Is it O.K if I owe you five hundred? -Fine Look, it's the artist. Are you coming or going? -A bit of both More like going What are you doing here? -Playing the pools A 7 68-mark set up Four sure bets, one fully secured, the rest half-secured Another set up with six secured. What are you doing here? I came to wish you a happy birthday, since you've set up the reception here I have to get to Jyväskylä for a gig Did you hear the army fighter? What causes the bang when the sound barrier is broken? Do you hear it only once or is the barrier broken again and again? I play popular folk music. Apart from that- I'm not really interested in the physics of sound waves So what are you interested in? -Mainly personal stuff And what does that mean nowadays? Mostly everyday cash flow problems How to scramble money for the rent? Who'd lend me a couple of hundred? Who should I pay back first? Should I eat something? Should I pick up a skirt? Where can we can we get a gig? Most acutely, how to conjure up five thousand by next Tuesday You couldn't lend it to me? -You should learn from Hannu He gets by on his own. That boy's never been shy of work You could also have made something out of yourself I did become something Graduated with the best grades. And I'm a graduate engineer for life It was your own brilliant idea to study folk music It must be great to be able to just follow any wild whim in life Another one, please Doesn't look like you can make ends meet by playing I'm happy with my life. -You sure settle for little So what's your bank account number? Savings and Loans 5 7 1322 This is a million-mark round. If the smaller set up pulls through- the winnings will go on your account But they won't be there until Wednesday These are exiting times The only thing you talk about nowadays is money There is something else we need to talk about I promised mom I'd bring you home. Whatever it takes We found your bottle of wine If you have to get wasted, you could wait until later tonight Could you go home before mom flips out? There was no bottle of wine What the hell was it then that we found hidden in the firewood? Hannu is about to pull into that yard You could still get through the party without making a fool of yourself... I can't be with you this evening... God damn it! -The night keeps calling me away... You've got a lot of nerve! -Don't start acting offended Or do whatever the fuck you like Go ahead, a hundred proof pure soda water I've got stuff behind the bar to spike it with Thanks for the gift, lads A pint of lager and a double whiskey I would like to perform a special song on my father's birthday If no one objects Especially you yourself. -It was actually yesterday This is one of my father's favorites Since he's a sworn choir singer, do feel free to join in Happy sixtieth birthday, Dad It goes like this: My coat don't need a mending thread my soul needs a tender touch instead you can't hear any poems at the bar drunken clatter drowns them by far that face in the mirror cannot be mine it belongs to those who wine and dine but one thing gives me solace in need to know you loved me once indeed Is mom really as upset as Esa made her out to be? Could we stop at the store and drop off the pool coupons first? I'd better take you home right away I'll drop off the coupons later. -I can drive I'd never wish to bring you down What remains when everything's down to the bone Is a heart's desire not to be alone Excellent choice Anyone driving out to Jyväskylä? Around 2 p.m.? Even 4 p.m. would be get me there in time Good Morning, Shag Stop calling me "shag" or I'll start calling you names too You probably already do when you're with your friends Yeah, names like "girlfriend" Oh Shag, you're so wonderful Let me take a leak in peace. -No, open the door for me Go to work! -I have a question for you, Shag Do you pee standing up or sitting down? -It depends I want to watch. -You're nuts I've never watched at close range. -And you won't now, either If you let me watch, I'll never call you "shag" again I can't see anything if you cover it with your hands I can't do it if you keep staring I'll turn on the faucet.... pssshh... psshh...
