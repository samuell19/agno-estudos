[eerie crackling] [eerie ambient music] - [Sarah] You wanna know my biggest fear? It's not dying. Or heights. Or planes, or spiders or anything like that. It's the thought of losing you. I care about you so much. And honestly, I can't even imagine a life without you. [ominous music] So make me a promise. Stay. Stay in my life forever. [woman screams] [woman screams] [ominous music] [gentle upbeat guitar music] - [Sarah] Okay, so I am missing three fingers, burns cover half my body, and I'm missing an eye. - Missing an eye? - Yeah. - Would you be wearing an eye patch or something? - No, I think I'd embrace it. - Just have it out there for everybody to see. Just this big old hole in your head. You're okay with that? - Yeah. I think you'd get used to it with some time. - It's pretty gross. Are you gonna wear a glass eye, at least? - Hey, that wasn't part of the question. - Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would. I would still be with you. - Wow. - What? I would. - You're really desperate. - Okay. All right. What if I have a man bun? - Oh, and suddenly it's over. - What? - It's over. Plain and simple. - Okay, so wait a second. I am willing to put up with burns, a missing eye, whatever. But the minute, the minute I decide to grow out my hair long enough to wear it in a bun, that's it. Have a nice life. See you later. Seriously? - Heart wants what the heart wants, baby. - Ooh. Treat them mean. - Hey, you're still here. Hey, babe, would you mind slowing down? It's a 55 here. - Your father said your mother was a backseat driver, too. - Wow. - What? - You think I'm a backseat driver? - I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. - No, no, no, I think you'll find, I said your father said your mother was a backseat driver. - Too. You said, "Too." - Did I? - I just want to get you there so you have time to have, you know, time. Have time. - I know. I've known for a while this would eventually happen. - Do you wanna talk about it? - No. - Okay. - He always had a big heart. I guess we just didn't know he literally did too, and not just figuratively. I know it's gonna kill him eventually, but I just want him to make it to the wedding. I don't wanna talk about it. If he could just be there for that day, maybe that would be enough. Well, not enough. But it would give him something to look forward to. Maybe even live for. He could get involved with the plans. Help us find a venue. I just, I want it to be the best day for him too. But I don't wanna talk about it. 'Cause he worked. He worked hard all his life just to take care of us. And it's not fair, because there isn't anything anyone can do. But I can do this. And it will help him focus on the future, even if there's not a lot of that left. But I can give him this day. But I don't want to talk about it. - Then, we don't have to talk about it. - I did it again, didn't I? - Yeah. It's okay. ♪ See the ghost up on the hill ♪ - What?

Hey. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - [Michael] What is it? - [Sarah] Ice? - Ice. - In the desert. - [Michael] That's weird. - [Sarah] Not weird.

See, he could have passed us, but now he's fucking with us. - Okay, well maybe just pull over or something. Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's just gonna stay right behind us. Slow it down. [tires screech] - [Sarah] Any particular reason you decided to play Tokyo Drift with that guy? - [Michael] We were being followed. - Followed on a straight road? - He could have gone around. - It's probably just some college boys trying to show off and mess with you 'cause they can. Doesn't make them any less of assholes, but being followed's a big stretch there, babe. - I know what I saw. - Okay, so why didn't they follow us in here? - Witnesses. - You watch too much Forensic Files. - Oh, okay. - So he was a murderer? - Yeah. Maybe. - I see. - Or a serial killer. - Mhmm. But he didn't follow through because of the witnesses. - Exactly. - Yeah, you're right. The tumbleweed would make some excellent witnesses on the stand. What's more likely? - Tumbleweeds? Yeah. Maybe. - What's more likely? - College assholes. - Thank you. - Anyway, you should probably call your dad. Let him know we're gonna be a bit late. - Now that, I can agree with. Shit. - What? - Of course, no service. - Maybe this place has a phone. - Is this place even open? - [Michael] Let's find out.

But these good people don't. - I can drive, if that's the issue. - I'm hungry. - Of course you are. - I'll tell you what. If you can make me a bacon grilled cheese in the car, we'll hit the road. - Okay, fine.

He's always wanted to walk me down the aisle. - Babe, that was several heart attacks ago. - Nothing's changed. - [Michael] A lot has changed. Look, don't you think it's best you spend time with him? I feel like that's what he would want. - And how would you know what he wants? - We've been dating since freshman year of high school. I know your father better than I know my own. Hell, he's the one who taught me how to drive. - Oh, did he teach you how to speed too? - Don't deflect, please. - Fine. What is it you wanna say? - Just because your father is ill, it doesn't mean we need to jump the gun to get married. - Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. - Yeah, I'm sorry. That came out harsh. What I'm trying to say is we shouldn't just rush the planning, okay? It's our day. Especially your day. Don't you think we should enjoy it? Of course you want him there.

I haven't had a chance to look. - Okay, I have a question. What are these quarters for? - Everyone gets two. That's what you need. - For what? - For the jukebox. You don't have to. You can keep them if you want. - I would be 50 cents richer. - [Waitress] Spend it wisely. - My 50 cents? - Your two quarters. - Oh, I'll have to check the 401K first before I blow this. - Michael. Sorry about him. You'll tune him out eventually. - Well, at least he's nice to look at. - Yeah. Hear that, babe? Don't ever lose your looks. - Well, better put these quarters to use. Oh, no way.

It's all right. He'll understand. - Yeah. We should have used that ancient payphone. - Well, you can't now. - Why is that? - Because you blew your quarters on a vanity performance. - Wow. You know that performance was for you. - Hey, keep in with me. I still got my quarters. - You are a wise woman. - I am. - Well, you know what they say? Youth is wasted on the young. - Stop it.

We can talk in the car. - No, we need to stand still until we make sense. - Sarah. Sarah, give me the keys. - But- - Don't argue. - Why? - We were followed. Sarah.

Sarah? - Just call the police, okay? - I can't, I don't have any service. - Oh my God. - The diner. - [Michael] Worked last time. [car roars] [man growls] [Sarah retches] - Sarah, are you okay? Sarah? Sarah, what did you see? - I don't know. But it wasn't a person. It was something else. And it's not gonna stop until it catches us. Please.

We are being followed and chased by someone. They're in a black muscle car and they were chasing our car down. - [Dispatch] Okay, ma'am, where is he now? - I don't know. He drove off after we pulled into a rest stop. - [Dispatch] What's your name? - Sarah Collins. - [Dispatch] You're at the diner on Route 66? - Yes. Yes. That's us. Can you send someone over to help? - [Dispatch] Well, he's gone, right? - I don't know. Look, he's chased us twice now. - [Dispatch] Did you get a plate number? - No, we didn't. - [Dispatch] Well, I can have a unit swing by. Do you have somewhere you guys can stay for a few hours? - Hours? - [Dispatch] Ma'am, you're not exactly at first and Maine. It'll take some time to get a state trooper to your location. - You're kidding, right? - [Dispatch] No ma'am. I'm not. If you're not in immediate danger, this isn't an emergency. - But he's still out there. - [Dispatch] Then you and your boyfriend stay off the road till the state trooper unit gets there, and they'll advise you what to do from there. - Excuse me? - [Dispatch] Stay where you are, and we'll be there as soon as we can. - [Michael] Can I get some help here? - Ah, my friend, so good to see you again. - [Michael] I need your help. I need your help. - What happened to you? - We were driving again out there, and we hit something again. - Denise, let's get some water, shall we? - Listen to me. We were driving. We were driving, right? We hit something again. We keep hitting it, and we keep getting chased down by this guy. Which is why we ended up here in the first place. And he's trying to run us off the road, and I think he's trying to kill us. And I don't know why. I don't know what we did to him, and I don't know why he's out there, but I'm just wondering if he's been here before. Do you- - Sir, sir, calm down. My word, what a stressful day it sounds like you're having. It sounds like somebody's just messing with you, but there's no need to get so worked up. - I don't think that's it. I think this guy is targeting us. He's stalking us. - My word. What an exciting day it seems like you've had. Denise, how are we doing with that water? - We need help. - I will help you. What help is it you think that I can give you? I'm not being sarcastic. I'm actually asking you, sir. What is it I can do to lower that heart rate of yours just a little so that you relax? - I can't relax. We're out there and there's this guy. - Fight or flight. - What? - Fight or flight. That's what you're doing right now. Your body thinks it's in some sort of trauma. Why do you think you're in danger, so you triggered this ancient instinct of man: fight or flight. Like if you hear a growling dog, or a car suddenly brakes in front of you, an adrenaline rush kicks in, and it's fight or flight. So you ran, right, to here. - Yeah. We run, because we cannot outrun this guy. - But you can. You're here. You're safe. You've stopped. - Yeah, there are people here. - So, there's safety here. - [Michael] Safety in numbers. Yeah. There's people here. - So you are safe, sir. - For now. - Well, you are. - For now. - So, say it like you believe it. We're safe. There's nobody here trying to hurt you. Nobody chasing you. You're safe. Say it. - We're safe. - All right. Now, how's that heart rate of yours? Ah. Drink this, and I promise you'll feel better. And if there is somebody out there chasing you, I'm not surprised he found you, because you left the diner going the wrong way. Remember? - I'm sorry, what? - When you left, you took a right and you should have taken a left. We saw you. We were actually taking bets on how long it would be before we saw your car whizzing by again. Remember? Which reminds me, one of you owes me $20. - Yeah. No, I don't see how that's possible. We could have both sworn when we went the right way. - Is that so? - Yeah, we certainly both remember it that way. - Well, myself and my colleagues all saw you take a right when you should have taken a left. Look, you're exhausted. You're clearly tired. You've probably been driving all day. You don't know which way is left, which way is right. - Okay, so if we went the wrong way, how did we end up back here? - Well, the road, it does a huge loop. If you take a right down there, you'll see what you probably thought was an exit. But it's actually the continuing highway. If you stayed on, it loops you right around. And you would've come right back here, sir. - That wasn't on our GPS. - GPS? Nothing here works. This is a, well it's a dead zone. - We noticed that. - All right. Take a minute. Take a breath. Honestly, you know what I think you guys need? A nap. - No, that's very kind. We- - [Manager] Because you've gotta be somewhere, right? You gotta go somewhere. Everybody coming here is passing through. Nobody's coming here. This is the middle of nowhere. But honestly, what use are you going to be to anybody if you don't know which way is up and which way is down? - [Sarah] Michael? - Hey, what happened? Are the police coming? - Yeah, eventually. - What? - [Sarah] Yeah, they said there's nothing they can do. They're gonna send out a unit. But the ETA is hours. - Hours? - Yeah. - This is such bullshit. - [Sarah] No, I know. I let them know that. Trust me. They said just stay here. - Ah, well, if I might, that sounds smart. If there really is somebody stalking you out on the road, isn't it best that you spend the night here? Well, surely by first light in the morning, he won't still be hanging around. He'll be long gone. If that's the advice from the police, really, I must insist we have a room here you can sleep in. You can head out first light, and you will get to where you are going. - How much will that cost us? - Oh, please. This is clearly an emergency. It's on the house. Really, I must insist. - Okay. I guess that's something we can do. - Great. Well, how about we grab a seat? Denise, let's get them some menus. Let's take care of our guests. Guys, I will see to your room, but I will be right back. - Well, hello again. Hope everything's all right. - Could be better. - [Waitress] Well, at least you're staying to eat this time. - Yeah, I guess so. - Here are the menus. Can I get you something to drink? - Can I actually just get a couple more quarters for the phone booth? - I can only give you two. - [Woman] You can take mine. - No, that's- - They're mine. Okay. I can do what I want with them. - That's very kind. But that's all right. - I have them. I left them outside. - Oh, I don't wanna be any trouble. - [Woman] It's no trouble. I'm gonna go and you stay here and wait, and I'll be right back. - Actually, I think I have some here from before. - Don't spend those. - I'm sorry? - Whoa, whoa, okay. All right. Sorry about this folks. Why don't we get our best customer a fresh pot of coffee? - I'm just here to help. - It's all right. Okay, listen. They don't need any help. - They need quarters. - Honestly, we don't. But thank you so much. We appreciate you trying to help us. - I'm trying. They're not. They say they will. - My word. I am so sorry. - Is she okay? - Ah, to be frank, no. She's a bit of a self-harmer, but a regular here. So, we know what to do, and we do our best to take care of her. If you'll excuse me, I'll go do that. Did I hear you need some quarters? - Yes. Thank you. - I'll see to the room. It'll be ready shortly. Please enjoy yourselves. - All right. I will go call my dad. - Do you want me to come? - No. No. You stay. - Come on. Come on, please pick up. - [Voice] Hello? - Dad? - [Voice] Hello, pumpkin. - Dad, it's me. - [Voice] Honey, can you hear me? - Dad? - [Voice] Pumpkin? - Dad, are you there? - [Voice] I can't hear you. - Dad. - [Voice] Sarah. I can't hear you. - Dad, are you okay? - I can't hear you, Pumpkin. - Dad. Dad, it's me. - [Voice] Hello, Sarah. - Dad? Dad? - [Voice] Where are you guys? Are you gonna come today or not? - Dad? [line drops] [eerie music] [keys jangle] - Please. I'm not ready. Please, I just need some more time. - Everything is gonna be okay. - Please. - Take it easy. - I really don't wanna go. - We've been here before. You have to go. You can't stay. It's easier if you don't struggle. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? You think you're safe, because you feed the beast. But he's hungry. He's always hungry. - Rebecca, I take no pleasure in this. - No. Please, no. - Sorry. [ominous music] [birds squawk] - [Bus Boy] So, y'all enjoy the food? - Yes. We did. Thank you. - I don't think I can fit into my pants anymore. I gained 10 pounds just by looking at it. - Glad you enjoyed it. - Thank you. Your room's not ready. - [Michael] Okay. - [Manager] Oh, my mistake. We were gonna take care of that for you. - [Michael] Oh, thank you very much. - That'll be all, Bob. - Yes, sir. - [Manager] I'm just seeing to your room. Sorry. Would you gimme one more minute? - Thank you. I'm still freaked out, Michael. - Yeah, me too. - I mean, it's still daylight outside. It doesn't even look like it's changed. Hey, check your phone again for me. - I can't. It died a while ago. - Shit. Me too. - [Michael] Did you bring a charger? - No. I have one at dad's. - Okay, well, look, I think we should just try to rest and relax for the night. Okay? - Yeah. I'm not going crazy, right? - That's not exactly taking it easy. - Come on, just tell me I'm not. - [Michael] Baby, if you were going crazy, that means I'd be going crazy too. And there is no way that we'd both be going crazy at the same time. - Okay, well, what if I went crazy, and you are just in my head right now? - We're not going crazy, and we shouldn't be going down that rabbit hole. We need to rest. - Yeah. All right. - Everything is going to be okay, I promise. - Okay. - So, good news. The room is ready. Now, I've made sure it's the one without the bedbugs, but legally, I think I'm required to tell you, there is a little bit of mold in there. I don't think it's a big deal for just one night stays. I'm kidding. There's no mold, no bedbugs. It's a bad day to throw around jokes. - No, I think we're just a little tired. - [Manager] Yes, of course, of course. I'm sorry. Just you guys need some well deserved rest. - You are probably right. - Yes. First time today I'm right. Apparently. Bob. - [Bus Boy] Yes, Boss. - How about that room key? - Room for three? - [Manager] Two, Bob. You can see that there are two of them. There's some dishes in the back that I think require your attention. Go. - Yes. - So sorry about him. He's like Igor. The room. Come on. It's ready. I'm excited to show you the rest of the place. - So, how long have you been running this place? - All my life, it feels like. - You don't sound like you're from around here. - Ah. London originally, of course, but I've traveled. - You're a long way from home. - Everybody I know is dead and gone. - [Sarah] So this is home now? - Sort of. - Have you ever heard of anything like this happening before? Like, people being chased down in the area? - Honestly, I can't say that I have. - It just feels a little strange. Like, why- - Sarah. These are questions I wish I could answer for you. I just can't. It's best not to think about it. Now, I have a special surprise for you guys: the honeymoon suite. I think you're gonna like it. - Did you tell him my name? - No. - Then how does he know it? - Maybe he heard me calling you? - Yeah. Babe, maybe. But Sarah? [tense music] - [Woman] No, I need some more time. I'm not ready. Please, please. I'm not ready. - We have to go. - What do you mean? - Ah, here we are. - We seem to have forgotten some overnight things in the car. Hey babe, will you help me with it? - Yeah. - Oh, that's all right. I can have our bus boy bring it into you. He'll just drop it straight in. - No, it's okay. I think we'd rather get it ourselves. - Oh, I get it. The man's a little odd, but trust me, he's honest. Honest to a fault, actually. Go in, relax. You've already been through so much today. - No, really. Thank you. - You don't want to do this, Sarah. - That's my name. - And neither do you. Michael. Look, it's not safe out there. - How would you know that? - I'm asking nicely. Please. Just stay. - Doesn't sound very nice. - Let's go inside the room. We'll talk it all through. I'll explain. - Go. - No, wait. - Go. - [Manager] Wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, no, it's not safe. Fuck. What the fuck was that about? Both of you. - Doesn't surprise me you scared them off like that. - You know what happens if they run. - To be fair, you're not exactly the smoothest talker, the most approachable man. - Oh. Fuck you both. They'll be back. They have nowhere else to go. - [Waitress] I just need to ask you. Instead of condemning these poor people, can we help them? - Do we look like angels? No. Fuck you. Stay away from me, both of you. [door slams] - [Michael] What just happened? - [Sarah] I don't know, but they're in on it. Well, maybe not all of them, but you were right before. Something's not right. - Man, I hate being right. - They know more than they're letting on, I'm sure of it. - Oh, yeah. The manager, the manager. The way he was acting, he knew. He knew what happened to us. - Yeah. So we run. We run as far as we can. - Sarah? What? What? What? - It's back. It's back. It's watching us. I can't do this anymore. - Who? Who's out there? - Whatever it is, it's back. - Do you think it's them? - I don't know. But we're being hunted. - Oh, hey. Hey. Okay. Okay. Hey. Alright. Okay. Hey, hey. I've got this. Go ahead. Keep your foot on the gas. Good. Good. Just like that. Good, good, good. Now breathe. No, breathe. Baby, baby. Breathe. Breathe, breathe. Okay, good. That's good. Just keep doing that. Keep doing that. I've got this. It's going to be okay. You sure? - I'm okay. - Are you good to take the wheel again? - Yeah. I'm scared, Mike. I don't know what to do. Where do we go from here? - We just have to keep driving. We're gonna find a road somewhere, okay? Just keep driving. [birds squawk] [eerie music] [somber music] [bin thuds] - [Sarah] Something reminded me of him with you. And that's a good thing. - [Manager] Look, what exactly is it I can help you with, Bob? - Look, Boss, I know this is our job, but you gotta try and help them. - We don't have to try and do anything. - We don't have the power or influence you do. We serve you and those who come through. You might actually be able to do something. - What exactly is it you expect me to do? - [Bus Boy] Call him. - No. No. - Come on. Wouldn't be the first time. - [Manager] For something like this, it is. - Maybe he'll make an exception this time. - No. Bob. The answer is no. Sorry. Can't, okay? Just can't. - You won't even try? - Bob, you know what we have here, and how quickly it can be taken away. Like that. It's gone. - You know what the difference between us and management is? - What? - You think what we have here is actually worth something. - Yeah. That's all we have, Bob. Get back to work. - Yeah. - They're dead or dying, Bob. It's not our call. - You won't even try. [door shuts] [birds squawk] [phone buzzes] - I thought you said your phone was dead. - It was. Hello? Dad. Dad. Are you there? Dad, are you okay? - [Voice] Don't go back. Run. Run as far as you can. ♪ Goodbye love, goodbye sin ♪ - Do not stop for anything. Keep going. It's the one thing we haven't tried. - [Michael] No. [tense music] - Oh my. Keep going. - I can't outrun it. - We have to try. [car roars] - It's the diner again. - No, don't stop. - It is the only time he leaves us alone. We don't have a choice. - No, just trust me. Keep going. - They were waiting for us. - I know, but we can't trust them. We have to keep moving. - I don't know how much longer we can do this. - Well, as long as we can. We have to try. - Well, guess they decided not to come back after all. - They're gonna realize sooner or later that they can't outrun it. They're just being stubborn. - Can't say that I blame them. They're young and healthy. Still have that fire inside. That little bit of hope. - Yeah. Well, hope is a dangerous thing, Bob. - Well, it's keeping them alive. - You know better than that. - We used to be better than this. [door shuts] [dramatic music] [cars roar] [man growls] - [Michael] Okay, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but you have to trust me. - What are you doing? - Something different. - What the fuck are you doing? - You're about to find out. [tires screech] - This is your plan? - [Michael] Look, we haven't tried going the wrong way yet, so I don't see what can hurt at this point. - [Sarah] God, you are crazy. - Well, you knew that when you decided to marry me. So really, who's crazier? - You. Definitely you. - Look, unless you have another plan, we are doing this. - Fine. - There's no one behind us. This might work. - And that's how you jinx us. - How long have we been driving this way for? - Oh gee, let me think. Let's see. Oh yeah. Less than a minute. - You're a jackass. - Well, what do you want me to say, Sarah? The sun hasn't moved. The time hasn't changed. It could have been 20 minutes. It could have been an hour. It could have been four hours. - Well, here's something. We haven't seen jack shit since you pulled your little maneuver. - Yeah, that's a good thing. - No, Michael, it's not. - Well, how is that? No creepy death car following us. No diner, no possessed radio, and no imaginary things to hit. So for me, that's progress. - Wrong. That's neutrality. Progress would be finding something positive like another road, for example. - I'm sorry, should I turn around and go say hi to our friend in the black motor vehicle of death? - So what, then? We drive on this endless road to nowhere forever? - Forever is not a possibility. - Gas? - [Michael] We're almost empty. - Great. Fucking fantastic. At least let me switch with you. I've had some rest recently. You haven't. You can't keep going like this. - I'm fine. - Michael, please. - [Bus Boy] I know this is against protocol. [eerie music] Yes, I am aware. I just ask that you take a look at their file. Maybe there's some kind of mistake. I'm not implying anything. Just maybe this doesn't feel right. I understand. [Bob sighs] [clock ticks] Shit. [birds squawk] - Hey, hey, wake up. - What? What happened? Did we run outta gas? - No. I just realized something. - What? - We've driven past this exact spot a few times now. I mean, granted, no diner or creepy car, but we still aren't going anywhere. - What if we don't play by their rules? - Whose rules? - Whatever. Whoever's trying to keep us on the road. We need to be unpredictable. - What do you mean? - What I mean is whatever's happening, whatever's chasing us, they want to keep us on this road. - So, what do you suggest we do? Go off-road? - She's not exactly built for off-road. - Okay, so we walk? - We walk. - You're insane. - Hey look, if we run outta gas, we're gonna have to do that anyway. - Okay? But the desert could go on forever. We could be stranded forever. - It's either that or being stuck on this road forever. Hey, do you trust me? - Yeah, sometimes. - Well, let's go for a walk. - No. - Come on, let's go. [doors shut] [eerie music] - [Bus Boy] I tried. - We need to try something else. - Like what? - It needs all of us. - He's never gonna do it. - If we all work together, you know we can overturn this. - I don't know that. Neither do you. - Do you remember when we were them? - We had our chance. - I'm not talking about the deal. I'm talking about our baby. - Don't do this. - We never had a chance. I mean, what if we knew then what we know now? Shouldn't we try? If not for them, for another baby who never had a chance? - Wouldn't change anything. - We don't know that. We could try. But instead, no, we took a deal to live. - And we are. - This isn't living. You know that. - Could be worse. - I'll go if you go with me. - Okay. - Make him see. - Let's go. - [Sarah] We've been walking forever with no end in sight. - [Michael] Hey, keep the faith. Nothing has stayed the same, so no looping. It's just gonna take a little while longer. - How much longer can we even last? - As long as it takes. What is the first thing you want to do when we get outta here? - Take a bath. - How about a glass of wine with it? - No, fuck that. I'm gonna need something stronger after this. - Champagne? - I'm thinking vodka cran. - Well, whenever we get outta here, I will make you whatever drink you want. - Hey, you okay? - I see something. Come on, quick. I knew it. I knew this was the right thing to do. - No. No, not again. - What the fuck? Oh my God. It's our fucking car. - What? - It's our fucking car. - Whose blood is that? - [Michael] I don't know. - What the fuck is happening? - I don't know. Oh fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We're fucking dead. We're dead. We're dead. We're dead. We're fucking dead. [Michel cackles] We're dead. We're fucking dead. - Michael, please. No, no. No. Please don't do this to us. Please. - Well, I'm not going down without a fight. - [Sarah] No, Michael, stop. - [Michael] Come on. - [Sarah] Stop it. - No. No. Come on, you motherfucker. You want me? - [Sarah] Michael, no. Stop. - [Michael] You want a piece of me? Come on. - Michael. Michael. Okay. Okay, come on. [tense music] [car roars] [ominous music] - I wish you would just tell me what to do. - [Sarah] Come on. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. We just need to get back to our car and face this. Come on. I know what we have to do. Come on, babe. We gotta keep moving. He's going away. - He's trying to cut us off. - It's okay. It's okay. I got you. [tires screech] [car roars] - [Sarah] Baby, how you doing back there? You okay? - Oh, never better. - Hey, we're gonna get help. You're gonna be okay. - There's no help here. - [Sarah] No, no, no. Don't you start talking like that. You remember what you said, right? Everything's gonna be okay. - I got a confession. I lied. [dramatic music] Sarah. Sarah, it's not gonna stop. - We aren't giving up. - [Michael] It's the diner again. - [Sarah] How is this possible? - Okay. Okay. All right. I'm gonna be right back, okay? - No, please, stay. - It's okay. I'm just gonna be gone for a few minutes. I'm gonna go figure out how to get us outta here. Hey, look at me. It's gonna be okay. I am marrying you, okay? - I know. - I'm not lying. - I know. - It's okay. I love you. - I love you. - Hey. Where's the manager? We need to talk. - He's outside, where you parked your car. He's waiting there. - He's expecting you. - He's never done that before. - It's because he knows he'll be able to get to you soon enough. - You need to start talking now. - You lasted much longer out there than I thought you would. Let me tell you something you don't know, Sarah. You can't outrun him. It's just not possible. - What do you mean? - All you're doing is prolonging the inevitable. - What even is this place? - Think of this place as somewhere between your world and mine. A kind of in between. - In between of what? Are we dead? - No. - Sarah, you and Michael were in a car crash. You've been fighting for your life this entire time. You're not really stood here with me. You're bleeding out beside the road. You just don't remember. - [Sarah] Michael. So this is purgatory? - No. No. Because you're not dead. Not yet anyway. - But we will be. Right? - Everybody dies, Sarah. - So we've been fighting for nothing. - No, no. This is the most important fight. The fight of your life. It's just
