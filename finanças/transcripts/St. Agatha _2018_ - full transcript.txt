- Help me! Help, somebody help get me out of here! Help me! Get me out! Help me! Help! Let me out! - We take care of women like you. - Mary, this is as far as I can take you. - Agatha. - Yes? - I was given this address. - Always nice to have a new face around here. My name is Paula. - Mary. - All who come to this convent must leave behind their former life and possessions. If this is a problem, the door is there for you to return that which you fled. - No. - If and when you decide to leave us, your possessions will be returned to you. We operate under a strict vow of silence. This keeps us free from distraction and closer to the Lord. We have prayer at five am, breakfast at seven, chores until 10. You can expect to start out-- - Hi, what are you reading? - You don't need to do that. You'll find it doesn't matter if anyone in here likes you. - Look at her when she's talking to you. - Where is she? - Mother's approval is all you should concern yourself with. - Thank you, Paula. I think Sarah has chores. Why don't you see to it that she gets to them. Sarah, a sweet but simple young woman who is repaying her debt to us by staying on and helping wherever she can. I think she just likes to look at the pictures of the saints. I don't think she actually reads the texts. - My name is Mary. - Mary. Well of course it is. While we do spend most of our days in prayer or divine labor, we also make time for leisure activities. Such as reading the Holy texts in this library. It may take a day or two for you to adjust to our routine. But if you do decide to stay, our schedule will soon become your schedule. If it seems like I'm overly cautious with the bars on the windows and the locks on the doors it's because I am. We had a break-in recently. I don't need to tell you how evil the world is. Doris is seven months along now. What do you pray for child? - For an end to this pain mother. - Oh Doris. When will you realize that your pain only brings you closer to him? Do you think that he selfishly prayed for an end to his own suffering? Of course not. He prayed to end the suffering of others. Now, kneel. As you can see, we're going through a bit of a transition. The church in Rome, while they certainly agree with taking in people like you, do not agree with my methods. Which are strict, but very fair. So they pulled their portrait of the pope and cut the Vatican purse strings. Maintaining our lifestyle on private donations has been challenging to say the least. Which is why you find our sanctuary in the state that it's in. Right now however, I would like you to worry only about getting some sleep. You look like you could use a good rest. Focus and clarity are most important for a mother-to-be. Sleep well. - It's okay. - Oh Jesus. - They'll hear you. And you do not want them to do that. - Are we the only ones in here? - Not us in here. Out there. They sometimes listen in. - Are you serious? - They are. And they do not allow talking in the dorms. That's how they got Veronica. - Who? - The girl who used to have your bed. I'm Catherine. - Mary. - That, comes and goes. I think it's rats. You won't hear it after a while. It's not as bad as it seems. And you can talk to me whenever you like. Just don't get caught. - God damn it. - Mary Lou. God damn, as I live and breathe, Mary Louise Atchison. What are you doing? What are you doing in here? This your daddy? - Not yet. - Oh damn, I'm sorry, y'all playing a game. I'm so rude. I tell you what, deal me in and I'll get a round. Y'all drinking? Y'all drinking, we're all drinking. - You can get rid of him. Always spending his money on dice and booze. - Sounds like a perfect guest. - Oh shit. - What do you do kid? - I blow a horn. If I do say so myself, I ain't to bad at it. Yeah. I ain't seen you in a long time. You look great. Well, you go big or you don't go. Something my mama always used to-- Oh damn it, I'm so sorry. That was all me. - Fuck. - You two think I'm a god damn fool. - That was my fault. He didn't wanna do it. Look, here, have this, and you can have all of mine. All of it. - That's a start isn't it? Ain't you married Fred? I wonder how she'd feel. - Don't you-- - Give it to me god damn it! - Fine. Here. - And now you get the fuck out. - You were late. - Well you wasn't was you? - Whole god damn thing was started by the time I even got here. - Okay, where are we now? - Nearly there. Okay, look at me. God damn. I don't know why you don't just let me kill your pa. - Don't talk like that. - Well Mary Lou I'm sorry, but just anybody's gonna hit his own daughter like that is just... - Well, I'd rather it be me than William. I talked to him by the way. I got him prepped for when the time comes. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Does he understand? - Enough to know that him and his big sister are going on a secret vacation. - Secret vacation. Away from your big ass old father. - Oh Veronica, I've told you on more than one occasion, actions have consequences. Get her out of my sight. - Do not make another sound! - Do you know you are neither unique or special here? You should enjoy it while it lasts. - What? - Her interest. She wants to see you in her chambers. Make yourself presentable. None of your concern. - I'm just saying that I don't think it should be your... Mary, you remember Father Andrew. - It's a true pleasure to see you again Mary. - The hallway, there was-- - Blood? Yes. A rather nasty accident. Clumsy people make clumsy mistakes. We'll clean it up. - But the girl-- - My policies are strict, but they are there for a reason. And I know what it's like to be in your situation. - You were pregnant? And your child, where-- - He's a senator. Doesn't even know I exist. Obviously given to a family that could provide him with so much more than I ever could. So. How are you emotionally? - I get by. - It's important to keep your mind afloat during this period. It's your greatest tool. Healthy mind, healthy body. That's what your baby needs right now. You're going to be on my strict regiment of vitamins and supplements as long as you're here with us. Thank you Paula. Poor Paula. She's a little rough around the edges, but you must never take anything she says or does personally. Come. Mary, it's my job to ensure the safety of your child. I only want the best for it and I know you do to. After all, that's why you're here isn't it? I ask you a very simple question. Are you here of your own volition? In other words, and you know that I'm certainly not one to judge, I want to know that you're here because you understand that you are not responsible enough to care for the child growing inside of you on your own. - I come here because I am responsible and I'm asking for help to bring my child into this world. But I'm not giving up my baby. - Well that's certainly your decision. But while you are here you will be our postulant. You will live as we do. Giving yourself over entirely to the Lord in service and submission. Do you know where that money comes from? The money that puts food in our mouths and keeps the lights on. - No, no I don't. - It comes from our sponsors. People who believe as I do that women like you simply don't know right from wrong. That you don't have any degree of responsibility. Certainly not enough to care for a child on your own and that you need help. Please, don't mistake my gratitude for greed. After all, you've seen the state of things around here. And the other girls are so sloppy. I believe that you could be the blessing that we've been waiting for. After all, people want to give to someone like you. Someone who gives them hope. - I don't feel well-- - And Father Andrew is going to be your divine witness to your commitment to us. - Something, something's wrong. - Mary, do you know what happened to my sailboat? - No I don't. But we'll find it in the morning okay? Remember that secret vacation I've been telling you about? - Yeah. - We might be going a lot sooner than I thought. You, me, Jimmy, finally away from dad. Right, I love you. Go to sleep. I said go home. - And I tried. I already missed you. - Mary. - Well good morning. I'm so glad to see you up. I thought you were going to sleep all winter. - What time is it? - It's time for a fresh new start for everyone. And Sarah's going to help you with yours. - Sarah, what day is it? - Shh. Tuesday. No, Wednesday. I don't know actually. They blend together. Would you mind sitting so I can reach your hair? Do you want a boy or a girl? - I'm not sure. I'm not sure of much right now actually. - They say boys are easier to raise than girls. I had a boy when I first got here. He died in childbirth. They showed me a picture though. He was beautiful. - I miss you Jimmy, every day. I suppose it would be redundant to ask if you're staying out of trouble. I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake. But I'm hopeful it's just going to take some time to adjust. Write me back. Tell me you love me and we are doing what's best for our family. - She'll read it. Who's it to? - The father. - Just remember, there's no guarantee she'll send it. - Sit down. - I don't feel well, I need to... - You're not excused, sit down. - Catherine. - Sit down. - You poor thing. Would you like to be excused? - Yes. - Of course, you just need to finish your supper. - I already did mother. - Then why am I staring at it all over the table? We don't waste food here. - Shh. - There's something up there. - Mary don't. They'll see. - What is going on? - Mary saw something. - A face. - A face? - It's just a broken pipe! - Mary I'm still lenient with you because you're fairly new here. - I swear, I'm not crazy. - And if I recall, don't you also see your dead brother? - What did you say? - I said aren't you prone to seeing your little dead brother? The one you murdered in a bathtub? - What? No. I wanna leave. I made a mistake and I would like to leave. - Absolutely your choice. But don't you think you'll fair better out there with a good nights sleep? We're going to bring you something to calm you down. And everyone's gonna get a good night sleep. - I don't want it. - While you are in this house, you will abide by her rules. Tomorrow you can return to your life of sin. But tonight, right now, you will take these pills and show some respect to the people helping you. - He's here. - Shit, your pa's home early. - God damn. Son of a bitch. - William, dad's home early. William! - Son of a bitch! - William? William! William! William! William! - William, hey, William! Wake up! What have you done! - I'm sorry! Catherine. Doris. Doris! No. No. - Rejoice. All of you. Tonight your slate will be wiped clean. Mary will die tonight so that you may be reborn. But the sins of your past will continue to haunt and destroy you until you submit to our way of life. And to me. You do not deserve the name Mary. She was pure. She was innocent. And you are immoral, corrupt, and vile. But I have good news. I have found another. I rename you Agatha. - Agatha. - Help me! Get me out! Help me! Oh please, please, please. - Who are you? - Say your name. - Who are you? - Say your name. - Eat. - You're fucking insane! Help me! Please. - Who are you? - Say your name. - Who are you? - Say your name? - Get me out! Please, please. Make it stop. - Who are you? - Say your name? - Who are you? - Say your name. - Eat. Eat. - She's choking. - Let her. - I said enough, she loses that baby this was all for nothing. You need to stay calm and remember your baby. - Why are you doing this? - One must atone for their sins. Oh you will eat. Just like a little baby bird. - No please. - Hey, are you okay? Okay. - I'm leaving. I'm not letting you near this baby. - The hell did you say to me? - Do it. I've nothing here without him. I'm leaving just like mom did. - You still ain't slept have you? - I'm not tired. - Yeah I figured. You need to eat something. - I'm not hungry. - Remember me? - Jimmy. - I remember you. You two little shits took me for everything that I had. - What are we... - Ooh, you've been busy. - Stop! Stop! - Now-- - What do you want! - Where's my money? - Fuck you, I spent it! - Bullshit. - Stop, it's here! It's here! - Fuck! - Here. - No, no, no, Mary don't! - Okay just take it. Take it all! - Hell, that's 20, 30 times what I took off you! - Shut up! - Just go, please! - You consider that just an asshole pass. You hear me! - You have what you want, go! - Just about the right price to stop me from killing all three of ya. - Come. - Your name. Your name is Agatha. - Tell them your name, end this suffering. - Help me! - Who are you? - Agatha. - Louder! - Agatha. - Again! - Agatha! - Sister Helen, the footstool. My child, you came here to give your baby a better life. Now we can let that happen. Come. There we are. All that's left is to rid you of the vestiges of who you once were. - What happened to your back? Was it her? - She won't miss the child. It was my husband. - He did this? - Car crash. He died. I didn't. This baby is all I have left of him. I'm sorry. For what she did to you, really I am. But you need to keep your head down. - She put me in a coffin. - You to try and do what she says. If you fight her, that coffin will be the least of your worries. - I killed my brother. I was supposed to be watching him. He drowned because of me. He haunts me. I can't sleep. - You are unwell Agatha. In fact, you're very very sick. You're certainly not fit to be anyone's mother. - Sometimes I see things. - And how does that make you feel? - Out of control and helpless. - And how does your family feel about your situation? - They have all abandoned me. I could be dead. They don't seem to care. I need to lay down. I don't know what's real anymore. I see things. - What kind of things? - If I told you, you might think I'm crazy. Maybe I am. - Maybe you are what? - Crazy. - Bad dream? It could be the pills. They give me migraines. - Agatha what is it? - Was I here all night? - Yes. - I keep seeing things. Why are you dressed like that? - The donor breakfast. We eat breakfast with the donors while they judge us. - This is wrong. - There is no wrong or right in this place. - You're just choosing not to see it. - I see everything. All of it. And it breaks me every single time. - Stop talking. - If you let her see how you feel about anything she does to you or anyone you care about-- - Catherine. - She will use it like a knife to cut you even deeper. That's why I keep my fucking mouth shut Agatha. So should you. - Stop talking. - Oh she's fabulous. Look at how cute she is. - Agatha! Stop! - Somebody help! - Agatha! - Help! Somebody, somebody help! - Agatha stop! - Help! Somebody help! Somebody help me! Help! Somebody! - No, no, no, no, hell no. A soup kitchen. - What? - Uh uh. - We have nothing. Everything we had was just stolen from us. - I got this Kansas City gig coming up. - Okay, and what am I supposed to do? - Well how about you come with me? - And stay where? - You stay with me. You stay with me and the boys, it'd be fun. - Half a dozen roughnecks in a run down motel room. - There's four. Five. - Is that all you really want? - Well no, it's not what I really want Mary. But what I really want don't matter. I can't have the mother of my unborn child staying by herself. I'm out of options. What do you want me to do? - So you want to leave town and have me follow you around, and then maybe the next town after that? Or do you just wanna go alone? - Do I wanna go alone? Yeah, yeah I wanna go alone, yeah. Yeah you enjoy your supper. - We take care of women like you. You're going to be just fine. - They're gonna fix you right up. Good as new. - Where am I? - The doctor has been called and he is on his way. Thank you again. Paula will you see the Wrights out? - No don't go. Don't go. Come back! Don't go! - Oh Agatha. Get out! Out of my bed! Leave! Oh, we must clean that before it becomes infected. When you disobey me, it stings like salt on an open wound. - Just answer the god damn phone. God damn it. Operator, I've got a little bit of an emergency. Could you give me the address for the phone number I've been trying to reach? Alright, thank you. - I'm leaving here. I swear to God. - Next time I'm coming with you. - Not you two. Paula tells me that you two are becoming fast friends. I think that's splendid. Did you enjoy breakfast the other morning Agatha? I thought it was wonderful. It's so rare that we allow ourselves such an indulgence. But I think our donors are happy when they see us well fed and healthy. Didn't you enjoy it Catherine? - Yes. - Yes. Sometimes, all I will need is to eat a single perfect strawberry as proof of God's love. - I wasn't at the breakfast. - You weren't? Oh that's right. You were running around like an insane person. Sit down! Embarrassing me in front of our donors. This entire place runs on their donations Agatha. They want to see a healthy, beautiful, intelligent, well-adjusted young woman. They don't want to see someone plagued be demons. They care not for your darkness. Do you understand? Do you understand! - Yes! - You're just a wise-ass little bitch aren't you? You will not raise your voice in the house of the Lord. And you will never raise your voice to me again. Is that understood? - Yes. - I can't hear you. - Yes. - I can't hear you. - Yes. - Say it again. - Yes. - Say it again. - Yes. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You will drive those demons from your head and think only of your baby. Now get out. As I said before, the money simply isn't available. But you of all people should know that I have done more for you than anyone would have dreamed. Now, please remember that the harsh reality is none of us have any other real options. We have a problem. You have a visitor. And at some point you will explain to me how this boy came to be on this property. But now he endangers us all. So you're going to make sure that he's alone and that he leaves. Sister Susan is an excellent shot and I can assure you, she won't be pointing that at you. Because I would never do anything to endanger my child. Now, let's go say hello. - Mary Lou as I live and-- Look how big you've gotten! Oh my god. - Please, it's okay, stop. I don't wanna see you anymore. - You don't know what you're talking about. I traveled 300 damn miles to come down here and see you. - Are you alone? - Yeah. - And nobody knows I'm here? - No, of course not. - Good. I don't want you or anyone from my past to be part of my baby's future. - Our baby's future, my baby too. And what, what, I'm confused right now. What's happening? - Listen. Things are different now. - Okay, so things are different. Just listen to me. - I'm done listening. You have to go. If you love me you will go. - I don't understand. - You're just like my father. You just wanted to control me. - That's horseshit. No I didn't. - It's over James. This is my life now. - These people got in your head. - No. - Yeah. - No, they've shown me what matters. And you're not a part of that anymore. - Yeah. - Go. - Mary, come on now. - No, my name is Agatha. Go, you have to go. Please? - I'll go, if you come with me. - No. - That's the only way I'm leaving here. I'm not going anywhere without you. I'm not leaving without you. - No, no, no, stop. - I came all this way! - No. - Please don't make me go over there-- - It's not yours. It's not your child. It's not your child. - You're lying, come on. - No, it's not yours. - No, you're lying. - Go, go! Go! Leave, it's not your child, leave! - It's not your fault. - I sent him away. - They threatened to kill him. You didn't have a choice. At least he knows where you are now. It's poison. Paula's been waging war since she saw the first one. - Chins up. Smile. - Once again, I want to thank all of you. Not only for your time, but for your generous donations which help to support our girls in their hour of need. Please take this moment to get to know each of them. Who shall we start with? - Are you feeling better sweetheart? - Much. Thank you again for the help the other day. I wasn't myself. - Yes, yes of course. - We all have our off days. - I have just one more question. - We all have to work together on getting out of here now. Not tomorrow, not in the morning, now. - You can't, they'll hear you. - You really feel safe in this place? Knowing that you have to deliver your child into this? What? Sarah? Sarah if you know something, please. - I think they lied to me about my baby. His name was David. I gave birth and I heard him crying. I was excited to hold him and they took him out of the room. The next morning when I woke up, they told me he was dead. I was drugged. But I know that I heard him crying again. There were no other babies here. And a mother knows the sound of her own baby's crying. - Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. So much talking from young girls vowed to silence. You must have so many more things you'd like to say. So many secrets you'd like to share with God. - What's this? - You know perfectly well what this is. - My things? - Well yes, you're going to be needing them now that you're leaving us. - Leave? No. I don't have anywhere to go. - I know. And it breaks my heart because I love you so. But I'm afraid I only have room for people who are loyal to me. - I'm loyal, I am. I am. - Are you? - I am. - I don't think you are. Loyal people don't wag their tongues propagating hate and lies against the only person who's ever cared about them. - I don't know how to do anything else. - I know. You'll probably rot out there. I'll have no doubt. Paula, will you please bring Agatha to the dining room? You see Sarah, what I am trying to do here is much much bigger than anything you can comprehend with that sad little brain of yours. However, there may be a way for you to stay and keep your tongue from wagging against me. I'll give you a few moments. Please make your decision by the time I get back. Agatha, there is a reason that I command everyone to take a vow of silence. There's a reason for everything I do. Your continued meddling with the minds of these young girls will bring them nothing but pain. - Sarah? Sarah what did you do? - Paula go down to the basement and fetch the doctor. - Yes mother. - Get out of my way. Do you want to help Agatha? - Yes! - Then hold her. Let me see child, what have you done? Oh, you didn't finish. - You monster! You're a monster! She cut her own tongue out! They're monsters! - Shh! Be quiet before they make you lose yours. - Sarah will no longer be sleeping here. She is being moved to a room of her own. You did this. - Catherine, I can't do this anymore. I can't do this. - We could run. Right now. - What if Jimmy never comes back? - He will. - Just keep looking for the weak spots like we talked about. - That's it. - Doris went into labor. They came and got her a while ago. We need to get out of here. Please, you have to hurry! There's something wrong with Agatha! Hello! - Stop screaming. - Something's not right. - What? - It hurts. - What's wrong? - I don't know what it is. - Calm down. - I don't know. - Calm down. Take a deep breath. - No! - Where does it hurt? - No, something's not right! - If you don't calm down you're going to hurt your baby. Calm down. - Come on, go. - Mary. - William. - Do you know what happened to my sailboat? - William! - I said aren't you prone to seeing your little dead brother. The one you murdered in the bathtub? - No. - You killed me. Why did you kill me? Why did you kill me? - Help me! Somebody help me! No. No! Jimmy! No! You. You fucking monster. - Oh Agatha, you look positively dreadful. - You killed him. - More insane ramblings. Killed who? - Jimmy. - Jimmy, he left. Don't you remember? - No, I'm leaving. I'm leaving now. - Is this not your signature? - Fuck you. - You see, more anti-social behavior. You're not well Agatha. - Mary, Mary, Mary, my name is Mary! - We have several witnesses that will attest that this is your signature. One of them being our own Father Andrew. - Sit down! - Agatha, don't you think you've wasted enough of everyone's time? Delusions, hallucinations, false memories, homicidal ideations, insomnia. These are very serious conditions Agatha. Which is why I also had you sign this. Power of Attorney. Because you are not of sound mind to make your own legal decisions. I own you and your baby. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. But for heavens sakes, don't take my word for it. Perhaps you'd like to call somebody hmm? I don't think Jimmy wants to hear from you again. But perhaps the authorities. Yes, Paula, will you go fetch a phone for Agatha? We'll just wait. Thank you Paula. There you go. Anyone you'd like. - Yes, I'd like to report a murder. - Yes, of course. Oh this should be very good. Yes, by all means. Tell them you've been spending time at the convent and sleeping in a coffin and attending midnight mass with faceless nuns. And by all means, tell them we forced you to go by the name of Agatha. All sounds a little bit crazy to me don't you think? - Yes. Yes. The convent. Yes. Its over. Get up. Get up! Open the door! - Ma'am. - Sir, please help me. - Ma'am, that's far enough. - Please help me. This woman murdered my boyfriend and she's keeping me hostage and-- - I'm so sorry officer, she's not well. - He's upstairs. - Ma'am, may I? - I'd be disappointed if you don't. - He's upstairs. Sir please. He's upstairs. His body was right there. What? They moved his body. I don't know what's real anymore. I see things. That's not me, that's not my voice. I mean, I don't know how she-- I killed my brother. What? No, I didn't say that. I would never say that! I didn't kill him, he drowned but, why are you looking at me like that? I'm not crazy. - What happened to her head? - She has a pension for hurting herself. This happened shortly before you arrived. - No! - We simply haven't gotten - No, shut up! - Her cleaned up yet. - She did this to me! She's lying. - You can see she's delusional. She was sent here. In there you'll find a Power of Attorney. She signed it over to us. - I don't remember-- - Over there. - It's a sad case actually. The father of the child wants absolutely nothing to do with her. Paula, may I have Jimmy's letters please? Thank you. There you go. - That's not even his handwriting! Look, these are all fake. They're all fake! She wrote these. - You see what we have to put up with? - Earl, what are you doing out of the house? - No. - Are you okay miss? Whoa, your head. - No. No, he's a part of this! She controls him! He's in on all of this! He's a fraud, he's a priest! - Sister, we gotta get her to a hospital as soon as we can. - Sheriff, the doctor was called shortly before we called you. He's on his way. - Earl, let's get you home alright. - Officer, I run a convent where the health of my girls is paramount. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave and go home and get well. - Of course. - She's in labor. - Take her to the basement. - No, no, no! - Your name is Agatha. - Where are you taking him? Where are you taking him? Please don't take my-- - Mr. And Mrs. Wright, I have something for you. Paula. - Our daughter will love him. - She wants to see you. She's here. - Thank you sister Susan. Sister, would you ask Sarah to please bring me a glass of ice water. And bring one for Agatha, she looks thirsty. This whole garden is teaming with rats and snakes. - You're just going to kill me after I give birth. - I don't have to. You have no idea how long I have waited for this. You can't run anymore. You have no connection to anyone or anything. You're broken and damaged. You've already killed one child. Now the only thing that's holding you back is your own selfish stubbornness. Can't you see this is not for you. Wasn't for me either. You've seen what I'm capable of. What kind of a mother do you think I'd be? This is not who we are. - You're right. - Of course I'm right. And there's a wonderful family just waiting to take care of your child. - And pay you for it. The donors. You sell our babies. Do they know that this is not a real convent? - Well now, that's a matter of perspective. They don't know that my church turned it's back on me. They do know that I'm continuing to do God's work. It didn't take much for me to be able to stay here. Church didn't want a crumbling relic. So I continued to do their work. Only I'm turning a profit. Susan, Helen, and Olga, have become far too greedy. Sarah's too simple to be good for anything other than manual labor. And that of course leaves Paula. And I can barely stand her. But there are going to be so many women coming to me. I'm going to need help. - Would I be paid? - Well of course. And handsomely. I always take care of everyone in my employ. I'm not running a charity. - Do you have proof that these children have gone to good homes? - Of course. This ledge contains records of every child that I've ever given away. As you can see, they're much better off than they would have been with their pathetic mothers. You have 24 hours to decide. Paula, please fetch Agatha some supper and then take her to her room. - I think I'm, I think I'm... - I understand that you are frustrated. I hear it in your voice, but you promised me that I would have at least until Spring to pay. - Mother. It's Agatha, it's time. - I think it was just pain, I'm fine. It was just pain. I think, I'm sorry about the food. - You alright Agatha? - Yeah. - Alright. Paula, will you take Agatha back to the room and get her another plate of food? - Sorry. - Paula, would you come here please? Is Agatha asleep? - Yes mother, she's asleep. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I want you to make sure she stays that way. - Yes I understand. - She's been quite disappointing. Hit her over the head if you have to. - Yes mother, I understand. I'll take care of her. Hello? Sister Susan? Shall I bring Sarah her supper now? - No. Just keep her where she is for the next few days. She needs to learn her lesson. - Yes of course, I understand. - Keep her door locked. Stupid girl won't know anything's different anyway. - Yes I agree. - I'm leaving it up to you. - I want you to start going out. - Goodnight mother. - Paula. - Yes. - When Agatha leaves, we're going to be empty. I need you to start scouring the countryside. No cripples, no handicaps. - I found this. Your son is alive. They've been gas-lighting us. I need your help now. - It's a little light this month. I regret to say this may be your last payment for a while. - Get me out of here and I will make it worth your while. - Paula! Where's Paula? Did you take my money? You ungrateful son...
