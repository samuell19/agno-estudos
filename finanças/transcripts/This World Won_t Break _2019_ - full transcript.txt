You know, I've been thinkin' about this, and I'm not sure how I feel. The fact is, those blues guys came from rural areas to Dallas because there were people with money in the city, and they could play and entertain and they wouldn't have to work in the fields. You know, in some ways we're the same I guess. Wasn't much more than that. You know, recording contracts were pretty new at the time. They just wanted to play their songs and get paid. Early on, those cats were coming here to make somethin' better. I'm not sure if they really knew there was anything more than making money and playing in the streets and juke joints. But ultimately Blind Lemon Jefferson was the only one to make any money during that time, and he literally froze to death on the streets of Chicago. But he did pave the way for guys like Stevie and Jimmie. Now I don't consider myself a blues musician, but I identify with them 'cause that was the music that turned me on from an early age. One of my favorite quotes is from Townes Van Zandt, and he said, "There's only two kinds of music, "the blues and zippity do da, "and I don't play no zippity do da." I always just took that as either it means somethin' or it don't. And you can play the blues even though you're not playing the blues, so to speak. I hold those guys with the reverence of saints. They're all legends now and long gone. Lucky them. They all rest in peace, and I'm still here. Nobody knows it. All right, thank you guys very much. How'd you do? Oh, good enough for another whiskey. Right on. Have a good night. Hello? Wes, are you there? If so, pick up. Okay, I know you can hear me. Listen, I get it, you're still upset, and I'm not saying you shouldn't be or how you should feel.

Number two, we're both free to see other people. Number three, we are not allowed to shout obscenities while we are drunk to these other people. And number four, my parents are coming back from the lake house, so please have everything cleaned up and leave the key on the counter and walk yourself out the front door.

I thought maybe you'd wised up and was headed to Nashville. Mm. Oh, Lordy, hey. I got a better idea. Why don't you come up with me to the house? What do you think, huh? Couple of bachelors, it'd be great. You know, since Mom's been gone, you know, it's quiet and all. I know, I just I think it'd be best I stick this one out at the trailer. Come on, come on, it'll be great. No, just not right now. Well you give me a one good reason and I'll drop it. It's just, I feel stuck. If I come back and stay at the house, I'll feel like I'm gonna be moving backwards and I can't feel that right now, I just, I just can't do it, it's just as simple as it is. Moe. Thanks, Pop. It doesn't have any AC. And it has plenty of power and water, you know, and there's phone lines. And if you run out of food, now, in that icebox, well, you come and see me, all right? That, I won't take a no for. Hey boys, we're home. Say, my man, this your chariot? You a cowboy? I'm the sheriff of this town. Everybody knows that. Just because you wear a cowboy hat, that don't make you the law, see? Ain't room for one one sheriff around here. I catch you breakin' the law, I'll give you a warning. Second time, I'll put your penis in jail. If that don't work, I'll put it in hot hot sauce. That's just the law. Shit. I got my eye on you, cowboy. Shit! The sheriff's always watchin'! He's always watchin'! Oh, dude! Oh, dude, you have no idea how happy I am to see you. Oh man, I heard a thump on the side of the boat, I just knew I'd hit somethin'. Shit, thought maybe I forgot to tie up again, driftin' on out, hit somethin', again. Man! Man, I don't know how I got home last night. You know, some things in life are a mystery. Did you get coffee? Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about. You, my friend, are a true friend. What? What? Kolache? Oh, jalapeno, sausage, and cheese kolache. Oh, man, you are a angel! Absolute angel, man. Hey, you know what? You just bought yourself a ticket to the honey hole. Damn straight, man. Guaranteed to catch your limit there. I'm takin' you to the honey hole. Yes sir, yes sir, indeed. You know what trips me out, man? Birds. I mean, they can walk and fly. How cool would that be? Suddenly you realize a place you wanna get to is a little further than what you'd like to walk, so you just flap your arms and fly there, man. What's really trippy is that there's all kinds of birds. Social birds, loner birds, chill birds, birds of prey, talking birds, pet birds, little tiny hummingbirds, and ostriches. You know, in cartoons they're always making ostriches out to be scaredy cats, always stickin' their head in the sand? Truth is, they're meaner'n hell, man. Yeah, they'll peck your freakin' eyes out or break your kneecaps with one swift kick from them crazy long legs. Not to mention, they can run over 30 miles per hour. Now they can't fly, but turkeys can; a lot of people don't know that. Don't get me started on pigeons, man. Pigeons and doves, you know, they're part of the bird family Columbidae, makes up about 310 species of birds; 300, damn. But the pigeon that trips me out most is the homing pigeon. Man, these downtown city pigeons can navigate routes and followin' man-made structures, and makin' 90-degree turns, following roads, just like humans navigate, man. Yeah. You know, knowin' how smart these birds are kinda makes me never wanna eat 'em, but shit, man. Fried chicken? - Can't beat fried chicken. - No, sir. Hey, man, speaking of birds, why don't you play that bluebird song you got? Man, I'd just love to here that right now. - "Still I Fall," man. - What? - The song. - You talkin' that poetry gibberish again? Song title's called "Still I Fall." It just mentions birds from time to time. You know, it's kind of a simple song, I guess. If you wanna hear it, I'll play it. I'd love to hear it, man.

Said he had a hankering for sardines. Sardines, huh? You must be Sonny. Yes, sir, Sonny Valentine. Well, Sonny Valentine, is that thing loaded? Yes, sir, just put in a whole new batch of BBs. You mind? I hadn't shot one of those in ages. No, sir, I don't mind. But we need to find some cans for targets. Well, I can fix that real quick. Abracadabra. You got that in your sights? Yep. What part are you aimin' for? The middle, or the top to knock it down. Yeah? Why don't you try to hit that, right there in the middle, that red label on there. Middle of the red, yeah. Almost. Check it, I'll go for the log. So if you can't play guitar right now, what are you gonna do? Well now, Sonny, that's a good question. I don't guess I ever really thought about it too much. Don't guess I... really ever had to. I been playin' since I was about your age. Hmm. But, but I drove by the community college today, thought I'd give that a look-see. All right. If I can give you one piece of advice, probably the best advice I can give you, - finish school. - Gotcha. You don't wanna end up washin' dishes to make ends meet. I can't even do that right now. Well, Sonny, tell Lonnie I stopped by. - All right. - You be good. You don't take any wooden nickels. Remember, you shoot it and kill it, you gotta eat it. Gotcha. Oh, dear Lord, heavenly gracious father. I come to you today as your vessel. Please, dear Lord, heavenly father, we really need some more students at this school. If you could find it in your heart, dear Lord, to bless us with a higher enrollment this semester. Our endowments have been low. Funding from the state has been despicable, and don't even mention the district. Lord, heavenly father, please also look after Cindy. She is our new financial aid officer, and it does appear that she does get extremely confused a lot, and she does have an obesity problem, dear Lord. Please look after Susan, our administrative assistant. She has not been here in two weeks. They found a lump on her ankle. And she's been goin' through tests, dear Lord. Let's pray, I pray to you, heavenly divine father, that it is benign. We have a lot of copies that need to be made. Dear Lord, heavenly father, I ask this in your name, amen. Okay. Wes Milligan? - Yes, sir. - Oh hey, Julian. Come on. Here we go, heh. Okay. Okay. And, okay, what can we do for you here now, Mr. Milligan? Well, to be totally honest, I'm not quite sure. I'm kind of out of the loop from all of this. It's been quite a while since I've had to do this. But I figured it's about time to buckle down and do somethin' good with my life. Well, you don't get good by having good in your mind. My papa always used to say that, and it's true. Now Wes, you have already done the most important step. You showed up! All right. Oh! Hey, that is me, that is me, will you look at that? Is it that time already? Hey, you don't mind if I warm up my lunch here, do ya? I mean, it will really only take a minute, okay? Doctor's orders, they say I have to eat every few hours due to my hypoglycemia. They really do not want my blood sugar to crash. I get really zoned out. Okie dokie, I'll be right back. Lou Ann, get those headphones off. Okay now, where were we? Oh my God, look at this. You are still in our system. Have you attended anywhere else in the last 20 years or so? Uh, no sir. Straight into the work force, huh? No, no, sir, I've been writin' and playin' music. But you know, really hasn't take me too far. Well, I tell you what, let's get you all set up for the fall semester. Only got about four weeks till the first day of school, Mr. Milligan, now, lookin' at your transcripts, looks like you spent two semesters here. And you've got a two-hour credit in Fundamentals of Basketball. Yet everything else you did not manage to pass. But that's okay. We're gonna turn over a new leaf. Now, do you know what you might wanna major in? Uh, I really don't have any ideas. I just wanted to... General studies it is, sir. All right, now, basically, all that is is your basics. Okay, so, you're gonna need history, you're gonna need Composition 1, Composition 2, British Lit, American Lit. You're gonna need, let's make it, let's just do the science first, okay? So this fall we are offering biology, microbiology, physics, chemistry, and quantum mechanics. How 'bout the mechanics? How 'bout life science, okay? All right, well, let me go grab that printout for you. All right, Julian. Okay, so, here we go. Oh, so, uh... Mr. Milligan? Huh. Well, Julian, I guess he left; we lost another one. - Hi. - Hey, you got any vodka back there for two bucks? Yeah. Here you go, two dollars. Thank you. You know what, you can just keep the bag. Thanks, sir. Three. 67. 68. 69. 70. well, well. I didn't expect to see you here. You just missed a killer set. Maybe my all-time best. My big worry is I don't wanna get too muscled up, you know what I mean? Yeah, I don't think you should worry. Yeah. Catfish, you've gotta use those hips more. You're not doin' enough on the hips. All right! Whoa, whoa! Is that a good idea, Sneaky Pete? You're gonna get us in trouble. Wes, is that you? See, I told you. It was. Wes, you're always welcome back. That's what everybody keeps tellin' me. Buckshot, hey, where's that hot sauce? Buckshot, where's that hot sauce you owe me, man? It's barbecue sauce. What? It's not hot sauce; it's Buckshot's barbecue sauce. Barbecue sauce. Rex, hey, can you get Buckshot here another zinfandel? Buckshot, you want a rose, you want another rose? I didn't come here for a haircut. Yeah. Hey, man. Ah, here he is, Rocky Balboa. Rocky, do you know my friend Buckshot here? Buckshot makes hot sauce. Barbecue sauce. Watch my, watch my beer. You have a hot sauce, and you have a... Barbecue sauce? Barbecue sauce, like I said. Hey man, you're in my chair. I don't see your name on it, cowboy. What'd you say? I said I didn't see your name on it, cowboy. Hey Rex, let's get this guy a beer. Oh, shit, shit, Wes, Wes! Wes, goddammit, Wes, no, man, no, no! What are you doin'?

After all these years I thought I would be playin' different cities, to new fans. And it wouldn't be this. I know you're not happy with me. And I'm not really happy with myself. Good night, Miss Redfoot. Most of my world is rubbish. Wipe away all the glitz and the glamor, first thing you know you're in the dirt. You can't always be ignoring what's coming at you. It's as if you're going through life playing to the crowd but with your back to them. Listen, son. Pain is not abandonment. Trials do not mean judgment. It's love, it's love that hurts the most. You see, the most beautiful things in the world are those that are shattered, molded, and put back together again. People try to defy it, but this world won't break. I'll be prayin' for you, son. I don't need your prayers, old man. Oh yes you do. Who do you think you are, God or somethin'? Nah, son, I just look like him. What'd you do that for? Gotta get it all out. How come? 'Cause if it's around, I'd probably drink it all. If you had a bunch of soda layin' around and you could, would you drink it all? Yeah. Hey, um, why is it that every time you leave, you tell me, "Don't take any wooden nickels"? That's just something my granddaddy used to tell me every time I would leave his place. For the longest time, I never knew what it meant. Then one time I had this encyclopedia salesman come to my house. And he wanted to sell me a whole bunch of encyclopedias, and I said, and I thought about it just for a second, and I go, "Hey, let me see that W." It still didn't give me any answers. But it just turns out, it's an old people saying. So, back in the day, carnivals would come town. And they'd go to the general store. When they got to the general store, they would give 'em these wooden nickels. And when you bought somethin', you'd get your change with these wooden nickels, so you'd go to the carnival. You could buy your popcorn, cotton candy, ride your rides, play your games. So when they were about ready to leave, if you went to the store, somebody'd say, "Don't take any wooden nickels." 'Cause you'd be left with somethin' that was worthless. Did I ever play you that song?

No, no, it seems that seems that Miss Redfoot, she's requesting your presence at the skatin' rink. What? Was that her on the telephone? Yeah, she sounded lovely. Oh. You stay right there, hold on. Happy birthday, son. Go on, read it. To a great guy on his birthday. You know what today is really about? It's not about cake, it's not about candles or presents. It's really about how much you're loved. Say it every day, love, Pops. What's this? Well that's to make your new record. I'll be right back, hold on, I got one more. You're gonna have to close your eyes on this one. Got 'em closed? Yeah, I got 'em closed. Okay, open 'em. You gotta be kiddin' me. How did you even know about this? Ah. I don't get it, Pop, why all this? I mean, how did you even... You didn't sell the Silver Streak, did you? 'Cause that, you know that car is... Well, it's a pain in the ass. All it did was leak oil in the driveway. Look, son. Things come and go. But talent, talent like you've got, it's once in a blue moon. Thanks, Pop. Go on, get outta here. You gotta go on and see a girl. The one with that lovely voice on the phone. I'll get outta here, she can wait for a little bit. Now now, go on. Will I see you tomorrow then? Oh yeah. All right.

I mean, I can think of a few things I did that I shouldn't have. Well, it is your birthday. And I did need to give you this back. And I was thinking about what you said the other night. It made me real sad. And the only thing that cheers me up is root beer and roller skatin', so here we are. Oh, and um, I know you've been on a bit of a bad luck streak. It's a redfoot. Thanks. But wait, there's more! Drum roll, please. Ta-da! And it's even got your name on it; try it on. You look a little new country in that. I think you might have to break it in. In the mean time, maybe stick to that one. New things kind of make me nervous. You know its okay, right? You don't always have to have everything figured out. And you don't always have to carry that around, the past. It is what it is. Sometimes people make their own choices, and we just gotta move on. You know, maybe she wasn't the one. And maybe that's okay. Maybe she was just the one you were supposed to write those songs about. And who cares if no one knows who you are right now? 'Cause in 50 years, when we're all long gone, people are gonna be tellin' their grandkids about Wes Milligan. Now let's skate! I'm not much of a skater. How 'bout a dance? All right, we can do that, I can do that. Must have been eighth grade since the last time I've done this. Are we still even dancing to the same song? We gotta get you some skates next time, but... I can hardly walk, much less skate. I'm not keepin' you from makin' that record, am I? Well, I waited this long. All right, Wes, you been waitin' a long time for this. You ready?

No, not this time, Sonny. I'm only gonna be gone for a couple days. And besides, there's no budget in this one. I gotta sell these records first. But who's gonna take care of my crabs?
