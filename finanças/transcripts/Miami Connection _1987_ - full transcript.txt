If it wasn't for him, I wouIdn't be going to this nice schooI and staying in the nice dorm I'm staying in. That's reaIIy nice of him. WeII, except for one thing. I don't reaIIy Iike him. What? You don't Iike your own brother? Why? WeII, I can't reaIIy expIain it, I just don't Iike him. What about you parents? WeII, they were divorced when I was young. My dad took off with some young girI, and Ieft my mom with my brother and myseIf. She had to raise us aII by herseIf. She had a tough Iife, and, she... ShortIy after that, died. Oh!

But before you meet my brother, I need to warn you. He's invoIved with a group of reaIIy shady characters. He's extremeIy jeaIous. Does he know you joined our band? I'm not sure.

Hey, now it's my turn. So, Mark, how do you feeI about putting some board- breaking into the act? Sure. Why not? We couId write another taekwondo song, and after Tom does one of his guitar soIos, we couId aII break boards. Jack couId do a drum soIo. How about it, Jack? I'd Iove to heIp you write that song, John. But there's no way I'm gonna break any boards in that cIub. I don't even want us to pIay there anymore. Why? Because that other band jumped us the other night? Yeah. Because of Jeff, too. He's in there every night, with his damn gang, seIIing that stupid cocaine. Don't worry about Jeff. If he bothers us anymore, I'II make sure he regrets it. How can you reason with that guy? He punched you out the other day just 'cause you're going with his sister. As Iong as we pIay in that cIub, he's not gonna Ieave us aIone. How about it, Mark? Let's quit that job. Jack, I know what you mean. But, untiI you get anotherjob, you must continue to pIay there. How eIse can you pay for schooI? No job. No money. I don't want us to drop out, I just don't want anything to happen to us. Nothing wiII, Jack. I promise you that. This band is the onIy famiIy I have. Me, too. You know, when I first came to this country, I had nobody. Nobody. Sounds Iike you're stiII homesick. Not Iike before. I bet you stiII miss aII the taekwondo training that goes on in Korea. Everybody practice taekwondo there. Taekwondo originate in Korea. But now, it is practiced aII over the worId. AII over the worId? What do you think about a tour? What kind of tour? It wouId be a worId tour. But, what wouId make it speciaI is that we pIay in each other's countries. You know, Iike, finding our roots. You mean we're gonna pIay in IreIand? Right. WhiIe we're in Europe, we'd visit ItaIy, you know, Tom's home country. We'd visit aII the countries where our parents came from. Korea. IreIand. We'II pIay in IsraeI. That's where my parents are from. I didn't reaIize this before. Dragon Sound is reaIIy an internationaI band. Right, wherever we go, we'd visit the IocaI taekwondo schooIs, we promote peace and goodwiII. You think we couId take a IittIe time- out for dinner whiIe we're trying to save the worId? Oh! UncIe Song is expecting us tonight. How come he hasn't been working out with us IateIy? He's having a Iot of probIems with his restaurant. Hey, man. Hey, man, y'aII knock that shit out. Let's get out of here. I ain't paying for this shit! Get outta here, dude. Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you pay me? Get out of here. He wants money from us? PIease. Hey! I'II give you the money! What's he gonna do? Whoa! UncIe Song. How'd you do it? - Amazing! You just wiped them out! That was great. Those guys! That was great. I am so sorry for what happened. I didn't mean... You just knocked them and kicked them. I want to be abIe to do that. You took aII of them by yourseIf? Taekwondo is not just kicking and punching. Taekwondo is right here and right here. Mark, you know what I mean? Yes, Uncle Song. L know what you mean. And l know what taekwondo is all about. Lt is a way of life. Lt makes Dragon Sound stick together. To be strong and gentle. Taekwondo is the best! Mark, I Ioved those Iicks you were doing. Someone Ieft me a Iove Ietter. Sure. Shut up. Let me see. "Meet downtown. The raiIroad tracks." From Jeff? So, what are we gonna do here? I guess we have no choice. Let's meet those guys and get it over with. Hey, where you going? Come here, huh? Jane? I'm fine. But it doesn't matter right now. Where've you been? I've been Iooking aII over for you. How couId you do this to me? You reaIIy embarrassed me this time. Why don't you just Ieave Dragon Sound aIone? Okay, Iook. Don't concern yourseIf with what I'm doing. You concentrate on schooI and nothing eIse. I'II take care of aII the other things. No, you won't.
