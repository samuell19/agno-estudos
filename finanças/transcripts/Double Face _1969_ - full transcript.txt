'It had ended so tragically. 'And yet, it had all been planned down to the minutest detail.' Whoa! No, don't! Don't you do that! Keep still. No, you've got to keep still. That's it. 'I met Helen Brown while on a brief holiday 'and fell madly in love with her. 'We got married and we were both happy.' I love you, I really love you. 'Then, back in London, everything changed.' Why do you play this silly music all the time, Helen? I like it. Darling, will you scrub my back? Is there any particular reason Liz should be around all the time? Don't be a bore. Do I ever ask you anything about your secretary? And don't look at me like that. I don't care a damn what you think. Do you want a divorce, Helen? How middle-class. Even if my father found out, he couldn't care a damn either. He is president of the company, though. Yes, but I own 90% of the shares. Mr. Brown is practically an employee of mine. I thought you knew that. When my mother died, she left me everything. I see. He must have been disappointed. She wanted to insure my future. As I've insured yours. By naming you my sole heir. You'll have no problems. To our future, then. Where are you going? To Liverpool, and then... I don't know, maybe Scotland. When are you coming back? I haven't given it a thought. I'll write to you. Maybe you can join me. I'd like to but I can't, because of the theatre. So you've made up your mind? Yes, I definitely need this vacation, John. Are you sure you're doing the right thing? Yes, John, quite. I know it's right and Liz understands. You needn't worry. She'll be back. I can't stand him. He seems to like spying on us all the time. It's over. Poor John. I don't understand her. I know she's in love with me. For two years, we've been happily married. Don't think about it. She's just like her mother, rich, moody, wicked. Perhaps it's my fault. No. You'll just have to get used to it, like I did with her mother. I'll never get used to it. Helen? Are you ready? We're coming. Suki? Suki. Have you already got your things in the car? Yes, I have. Do you want me to book a room for you at some hotel? No, it's all right, John. Liz did it. You aren't driving alone, are you? Yes. Why? I think John would prefer it if somebody went with you. Well, I think I'm old enough to take care of myself, Father. John? - Do you mind? - Huh? Of course. Thank you. Bye. The driver lost control of the motor car, probably due to reckless speed. The gas tank exploded, setting fire to the car with no chance of escape. The husband and the father of the victim. Despite the fact that the body is beyond recognition, it can be stated with certainty that it is that of Helen Alexander. Calling control tower. Flight X239 from Liverpool requests landing orders. Thank you. Huh? No, thanks. In a few minutes, we'll be landing at London Airport. John, why don't you go away for a while, take a trip? Maybe you're right. I couldn't work anyway. Morning. Gordon? - Do you know this man? - Yes, it's John Alexander. Only three weeks after his wife died, he's in Saint Tropez. So what? Wasn't it an accident? Yes, I know, but there's something in this case I don't like. It's good to see you again, Mr. Alexander. Thank you. Excuse me. Mr. Brown is waiting for you. All right. John! Well... Marvelous to see you. I was beginning to think you'd never come back. Perhaps you don't know me well enough. I would never leave the company. Men never get to know each other well enough. But I'm glad you're back. I don't feel so lonely. I can't persuade myself that Helen is no longer alive. I can't believe it. I really can't. I know. I see her everywhere. We should concentrate on business, don't you think? You're right. You've got to decide if we're to merge with the French company. I thought you had already decided. The company belongs to you now. You have to make the decision. Do you mind if I tell you I missed you very much, John? Were you worried about the mail piling on my desk? Why are you nasty to me? Please. I'm not. I'm only a secretary to you. Is that it? What's happened since the...? Why don't you try to forget? Hmm. I will try. By the way, a police inspector asked to see you while you were away. He's out there. He called several times, insisting on seeing you. What does he want? I don't know. Send him in. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm Inspector Gordon of Scotland Yard. - Yes, I was expecting you. - Inspector Stevens from Liverpool. - How do you do? - Do sit down. - No, thanks. We're only here to inform you that the Liverpool police considers the case closed. I didn't know there had been an inquest. There are always inquests in accident cases. It's the law. Did you have a good trip, Mr. Alexander? I went to places where my wife and I had been together. It's not the best way to forget a tragedy, is it? Get these off at once. May I help you with something? I'm very busy at the moment. Mr. Alexander, I can see that. Responsibility for the company now rests entirely upon you. And this is for Mr. Brown. I was sure you'd return today. - Professional intuition? - Oh, no. Nothing as fancy as that, Mr. Alexander. It wasn't difficult, even for a modest inspector like myself, to foresee your return for today, quite simply because today is your wife's birthday. Mr. Alexander, will you return to the same house? For the moment, I am staying at the Savoy. Well, thank you, sir. Dry yourself and get out! You're too rude to be anything but the owner of the house. So? Hurry up and get out! Perhaps you'd be so good as to explain why you are in such a rush to throw me out. Ah, I understand. The usual middle-class husband. You can't be afraid, I'm sure. You don't look the type. Indeed, on the contrary, you're a brute and you've got a temper. And a lot of strength. Oh. You brought in the light with you. Turn it off. It was nicer... You owe me an explanation. Elementary, my dear Watson. Elementary. My name is Christine. 18 years old, without fixed lodgings. Having seen a beautiful big house, and very much in need of a perfumed bath, I climbed over the fence and here I am, beautiful and naked, as God made me. Bloody hell. To think I looked everywhere for that whisky and it was right under my nose. Hey, you can't drink alone. Please? Drink up and go. Villain, that's what. You're a dangerous man. Why don't you let me sleep here with you tonight? I'll be good and... I don't snore. And tomorrow morning, we could have a very... I'm sorry. I'm terrified of storms. - Oh! - I told you to get out. It hurts. I can't walk anymore. I'm sorry but that's your fault. OK, tell me where to go. I'll drive you. - Ow. - Come on. If you want your keys... See you. Listen, darling, how about showing that film of mine tonight? Hey, he's gonna show my film! Well, you still don't know Peter. He always saves the best till last. Try a little patience. You won't regret it. It better be good! Oh, look at that ring! Ooh! - When did you make this film? - Well, don't shout. I think it was last Friday. Tell me, what are you so upset about? - I want to speak to Peter. - Don't let him know I told you anything. - I want that film. - Things like that are very expensive. - Take me to him, then. - Oh, no, no. Wait for me here. I'll be right back, huh? OK? - Where's the projectionist? - Oh, if you really wanna dig him up, try that art studio at the port. Maybe you'll have... Sooner or later, Christine will get into trouble, taking up with the first bastard she meets. And you, Golden Lips, ought to learn to keep your mouth shut. Got me? What do you want? What are you looking for? You better talk. Put it back. I like you better this way. Tough but still alive. You've been sleeping for 12 hours. - Where were you hiding? - Where do you think I was? At the house, looking for Peter. These things take time, you know. I got there just in time to get you away from them. I convinced them you weren't a flatfoot but just a pervert, looking for the film. Where's the film? Peter promised to give it to me. Where's Peter bringing it? I've got a small room in a hotel near the Port of London. If you want to know, my window overlooks the studio courtyard. What's the name of that woman? Don't ask me to tell you. Tell me. All I know is they called her The Countess. Who is she? I asked Peter to get the film. He told me he wouldn't be involved... where she's concerned, that she's dangerous. A lot of people go off at full speed. I like to warm the motor first. Christine? Christine? I'm looking for a blonde named Christine. Second floor, number five. You can't go up. There's already a man up there. It will be more interesting. Hm. Don't fall in. And I thought maybe... Ah. Uh... Christine told me that you wanted to buy the film. You have good taste. It isn't something that comes along every day. And it's expensive, that's for sure. It's damned expensive. Do you want to count it? Among gentlemen? Where did you find the woman wearing the veil? You see, sir, as you can well imagine, this is a very risky business. It is not our custom... ...to reveal the identity of our actresses. Maybe I can help you. - A friend of mine brought her around... - What's her name? Tell me. Why such a hurry? - Why do you want...? - You ought to know. It's your business. Always at your disposition. Don't worry, you'll be seeing me again. You know... I was afraid there for a moment. What for? Among gentlemen? Now talk, if you want to save that face of yours. I've told you everything I know. I've told you already, I don't know anything else. I don't know, I swear. Yes, you do, you little bitch. Why did you come to my house that night? Why did you give me that pill? I want the name of the woman in this disgusting picture with you. You know I can't tell you. These people are not playing around. - You know they're a dangerous crowd. - The woman, the name of that woman. The Countess. I want to know the name. The name! Peter always went after her, brought her to the studio and took her back. The way he treated her, you could see she wasn't one of us. That's why we named her The Countess. But she had a name. One day, while filming one of these scenes, The Countess always performed with such warmth and realism, she suddenly bit me on the neck and whispered softly, "Always call me Helen." And then she kissed me almost with anger. I didn't know what was happening! Did she say anything else? No. Later on, I went back to Peter's office, and he told me that she was the wife of some very important industrialist and had survived a bad car accident and she was a little insane now. He told me not to talk about it to anyone else. He sent me out of the office. You said this picture was made five days ago. Six, to be exact. Listen, why does this woman interest you so much? Let's say that mine is the curiosity of an industrialist. If you're lying, you'll regret it. This is Alexander speaking. May I talk to Mr. Brown, please? It's urgent. Yes? Yes, all right. I'll call him later. - What are you saying? - It's Helen. There can be no doubt. When I saw the picture, I couldn't believe my eyes. When they were lying there, I repeated the same phrase over and over: "I know she's dead." She's dead. Helen's dead. But you'll have to see the film. You told me yourself, the woman's face was veiled. It was, but the scar on her neck, the pearls. The ring, it's Helen's ring! Why has she remained silent if she's really alive? Perhaps she did try to contact us but wasn't able to. But for what reason, for God's sake? She may be in the hands of someone who's blackmailing her. Huh. All right. It could be possible, but I just don't believe it. She'd try to contact us. Please. Please come along. You'll have to see the film immediately. All right, as soon as possible. I know there's an explanation. Poor John. He actually thought that he saw her alive. He's in a state of shock. He might do something foolish. He's not the type, Mr. Brown. In fact, we have come here to inform you that we have received anonymous letters which state that your daughter Helen was the victim of murder. It's ridiculous. What an idea! I'm not so sure, but tell me frankly, do you think that John Alexander could have killed your daughter? Of course not. Nobody will ever make me believe that. Wasn't he the sole heir? Yes, but he never knew it. Nobody knew it, not even me, until the accident, and the police said it was an accident. See if you can remove that bit for me. Gordon, listen. The explosion could have been caused by a device that was self-destroying. I might have found the reason why I could find no trace during the preliminary routine investigation at Liverpool. - Yes. - It's a matter for the lab. Better pass it to them at once. - Here. - Right away. Now you'll see the ring. I see a lot of precious things, but I don't see Helen's ring. Now watch this. Will you run that part of the film again? So, this is the famous film, eh? - Mmm. - I don't understand it. I'll be going. I swear I couldn't have dreamed it. No, you're not dreaming now, but you were dreaming last night. But it wasn't only last night. I also saw it at that place. You've talked yourself into something that doesn't exist. But that you could reach a point where you think Helen would participate in a disgusting film like that, well, that doesn't make sense. So you think I'm insane? Well, I'm not. And I know that what I've told you is true, even if I can't find any reasonable explanation why the film turned out to be so different. I'm certain. I didn't dream it. I don't know why the picture's different now. There's not much hope of discovering the truth behind it, but I won't give up. You know what I'll do? I'll go to the police and ask them to reopen the investigation. John, you can do what you want. Do you know what will happen if you ask them to reopen the inquest? Do you know what will happen? It will be a scandal. Every newspaper in London will carry the story. And our business, which was built on respectability and trust, we could be ruined. Now, we've got to keep this thing out of the limelight. I'm sorry, John. You know I'm on your side. Maybe we should go to the police. I don't know. Let me think about it. Do you mind? No. Was that Brown who just left or am I mistaken? An Inspector of Scotland Yard never makes a mistake. A legend, my friend, a legend. We have been responsible for arresting innocent men like Evans. Besides, criminals have become so clever that our profession has become very difficult. Do you want a drink? I'd prefer a glass of milk, actually. Do you really want it or do you just want me out of this room? You're as suspicious as a policeman. Don't bother if that's what you think. Lovely house you have. Ah, I see you're very much the home-movie fan. Mickey Mouse amuses me. Yet you destroy the films after seeing them. Listen, wouldn't it be better if you spoke frankly? Mr. Alexander, I will, but allow me first to say this. You're not obliged to reply at all. Think of me as your friend rather than a policeman. I must try to see you that way. I don't ask for blind faith. I imagine you loved your wife. Yes. They're beautiful. A magnificent collection. Amazing. Do they all work? Yes, I... wind them myself. My compliments. I'm afraid I'm boring you. I'd better be going. Do you play chess? No. I hate the game. I would have sworn to the contrary. As you see, the days of Sherlock Holmes are over. The garage is back there at the bottom of the garden? Yes. I must say you're lucky, having it so far away. No possibility of being disturbed by motors. Did your wife keep the Jaguar in the garage? Yes. I see. Talking of the Jaguar, I forgot to tell you that my wife's car... had the only clock I wasn't able to regulate. It was always an hour fast. Surprising. Hello? Hello? I want the Alexander file. There it is, sir. Thank you. You can go now. 'We arrived on the scene at six o'clock. 'The accident had occurred an hour before.' 'The accident had occurred an hour before.' Where are you going? She isn't there. That man Peter came an hour ago and they left together. - When will they be back? - I don't know. Maybe tomorrow, maybe never. Surprised? Yes, I have to say, yes, considering our former relationship. Would you like a drink? - When did Helen last call you up? - I don't understand. When did Helen last call you up? Before the accident. After! Then you know. You know too. That's why you're here. I don't know anything. That's why I'm here. I've been living in a nightmare for days. I'm almost glad you found out. Helen wasn't alone on that trip. She called me from Crosswell. She was unhappy. She told me she had persuaded her friend Judith to go along with it. - Tell me all the facts. - The other night I received a phone call. A woman who claimed she was Helen. But the voice, the voice wasn't hers. She told me she was saved by a miracle, at the last moment. Just before the gas tank exploded she was thrown out of the car while her friend Judith was trapped in the wreckage. Helen said she got away from the car before the explosion. She ran and kept on running. The body that burned in the car was Judith's. I begged her and pleaded with her to come and see me. But she, with that terrible weeping voice, she told me she couldn't come. From that moment on I thought the call was interrupted. But then I heard her repeat over and over again that she didn't want to see you, that she didn't want to see anyone. Did you speak to her father? No. He would only tell me I was imagining everything. Would you like a drink now? It's you. Will you tell me what you're doing here at this time of night? Why? What time is it? - 2:30. - My God, it's late. You still haven't answered my question. Easy. I haven't seen you all day. Then I realized that I might find you at home and so I used my key. Is there anything wrong, dear? No, now you're here, it's all right. I did want to see you. But then I fell asleep like mischievous children do. Alice. I'd like to ask you a question. What did that police inspector want from... Mr. Brown the other day in the office, huh? I didn't think it would be of interest to you. What were they talking about? I'm not in the habit of eavesdropping behind doors. Sometimes I remember you did. Careful. I'm tired of evasions, mysteries and half-truths. Better tell me all. I love you, John. I didn't want to hurt you so I said nothing. You acted so strange, so worried. Yes, it's true, Brown did speak about you. He said that Gordon suspected you had murdered Helen. And he tried to defend you, although you seem to be completely mad. - And? - And he also suspects you because now your mind isn't normal. - Are you sure? - I'm not a liar. John... Tell me the truth. What they say isn't true. You didn't kill your wife. You idiot. If you want a cigarette, they're in my coat pocket. By the way, John... How silly, I almost forgot a telephone call today saying that The Countess had... What do you know about The Countess? Nothing. Anyway, the gentleman left a message saying The Countess had gone back to the old family house. Hello? Hello? Who? He's at the bar now. Tell him Liz called and that Helen is waiting for him at St Anne's Cathedral. St Anne's Cathedral. Uh-huh, OK. Don't worry, I've got the message straight. Helen is waiting for him at St Anne's Cathedral. Here I am. It's impossible. Why didn't you wait for me at the house? Because I couldn't find the courage. I'll tell you why. Because you're not Helen. No, my wife died in the accident. No one knows that better than I. My face is your work. I was a beautiful woman. Now I am a monster. But... But how did you survive? Even my voice is destroyed. I am alive only by a miracle. I almost envy that poor girl who died in my place. Oh, Helen, my poor Helen. I don't want your pity. Kill me. I can't go on living like this. Kill me. - I knew it was you. - Let me go. Bitch! You've ruined my life. Mr. Alexander, I wouldn't do that if I were you. If you hadn't stopped him, Inspector, he would have killed again. What are you waiting for? Arrest that murderer. I'm not a murderer. Don't talk like that. I loved Helen. I always loved her. But this is insane. It's absurd. You can't arrest me. You have no proof. I recorded your telephone calls with Liz. They prove beyond a shadow of doubt that you killed your daughter. You tried to make Mr. Alexander behave like a criminal to make him appear suspect. - You'd better be careful what you say. - There's ample proof against you. I knew your plan wouldn't work. You son of a bitch! If it wasn't for the Inspector, he would have killed me. All because you wanted to grab your stepdaughter's money and become the real head of the company. Damn you! I told you you couldn't make this work. You slut. I knew I couldn't trust you. Let me go. Let me go! 'I always suspected Brown 'but after the arrest of Peter and Christine 'who confessed they had manipulated the film 'and after you told me the clock on the Jaguar went an hour ahead 'my doubts turned to certainty. 'The explosion had not occurred at six, as the clock indicated, 'but at five, as Brown had always maintained. 'Only the murderer could have known the exact hour. 'In other words, Brown.' Mr. Brown... has done you a favor. Otherwise you'd have killed him.
