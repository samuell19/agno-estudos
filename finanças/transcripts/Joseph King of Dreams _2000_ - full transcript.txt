[squawks] [insects chirping] [bird squawks] It's taking so long. [chuckles] Look at yourself, Father. You would think this was your first child. Tell me, were you this nervous when I was born? Well, yes and no. It was different with your mother. But with Rachel, we gave up hope. We were told she could never have children. [baby cries] Father! It's a boy! - Father, it's a boy! - It's a boy. [baby crying] - My boy! - [crying continues] Can you believe it? Rachel had a baby. I guess it is a miracle.

Stop! - What's wrong? - What's going on? - What did he say? Oh, it's Joseph. - What's the matter - It was wolves! There were wolves everywhere. Coming out of the shadows. I was surrounded. - They were all around me and-- - That's it? - You woke us... for a dream? - Ooh! Quiet down! You want to scare the sheep? - The sheep. The ram. - [brothers murmuring] - The wolves killed the ram. - [bleats] It was dead. I don't understand. It all seemed so real. - Everything is fine, Joseph. - It's over. There's nothing to worry about. And, you boys, since you're up, make yourselves useful. Get to work before sunup. [brothers groaning] - Thanks. - [grumbling] Joseph, where do you think you're going? Um, I, uh-- - You have studies. - [sheep bleating] But, Father, I wanna go with them. Look. You know they have their work - and you have yours. - But why? Because you do. Because you're a miracle child. For you, things are different. You've said that all my life. I don't want to be different. I want to be like them. Joseph, God has a plan and a purpose for you. You're not like the rest of us. I've worked this earth all my life, just as my father and grandfather did before me... and as your brothers will after me. That won't be your future. Jacob, even God rested on the seventh day. He'll find his future soon enough. Let him be with his brothers. Please? [sighs] Go on. Thanks. Be safe! [sheep bleating] [Joseph] Judah! Simeon! - Hmph! Look who's here. - The miracle child. What are you doing here? Don't you have some scrolls to read or something? Here, let me do that. Joseph, wait, wait! You have to be very careful. You might cut your hands on the soft fur. - Get away! - [laughing] - I... I just want to help. - You've helped enough. Thanks to you, we'll work an extra hour today. You're not tired because you got up early. It's because you were out all night. Why, you little sneak. What do you know? I know about everything-- the women and the drinking. There's a lot Father doesn't know. - You wouldn't. - He would. - The little brat. - Aah! If you say one word, I'll wring your skinny neck. Stop it! If Father sent him, we should be happy for his help. Maybe he can do your work, Simeon. - Huh! Somebody should. - [brothers laughing] Besides, there is something Joseph can do. - What's he doing? - I don't know. Shh! While we round up the strays, can you watch the herd for us? - Of course. - Good. We'll be back soon. Let's go. Maybe we should split up. You go over there. [chuckles] Hey! What are you doing? Hey! [laughs] - [bleats] - [laughs] [brothers laughing, chattering] - Hey, come on! - Look at him. - Whoo-hoo! - [shouting] - Get him. - You're too heavy. - [laughing] - [sighs] [groans] - [bleats] - What? Are you making fun of me too? - [bleating] - [laughs] Hey! Hey, come back! - [growling] - Huh? [gasps] Get away! Get away! [bleating] [wolves barking] Gotcha! [wolves snarling, barking] [whimpers] [grunts] - Get away! - [growls] - [grunting] - [continues growling] [sighs] Joseph, are you hurt? Father! [panting] Your brothers, where are they? I asked you a question! They're-- They're, uh-- They-- They went swimming. - Swimming? - [panting] - What happened? - This is how you take charge? I expect you to watch after Joseph, but you abandoned my son. - My son! - Aren't we your sons too? - The ram! - [bleats] [jingles] [brother] It's Joseph's dream! Wolves kill sheep. It happens all the time. No! I understand. God sent you a vision of the future. Joseph didn't really see the future, did he? Let's get back to work. [nightingale singing, insects chirping] [grunts] [squawking] Why do we wash before work? We don't want the sheep smelling you and running off. [indistinct chatter] Hey, look who finally woke up. Oh, look what the sun brought up. [indistinct conversations continue] Good morning, Joseph. Mom, last night I had another dream. - Oh, another dream! - [brothers] Ooh! I wasn't talking to you. Please, why don't you share it with all of us. Yes. Who'd the wolf get this time? You can laugh, but this time it was about all of you. Oh, please, you must tell us our future, great Joseph. Should I be scared? - Leave me alone! - Come on, Joseph. Tell us. We're dying to hear about it. Well, all of us were carrying sheaves of wheat. I was among you, but then all of a sudden, I was above you and your wheat bowed to me-- I wonder what that's supposed to mean. Nothing, that's what it means. Nothing. Hey, you asked to hear the dream. - What happened next? - The sky was dark, and all around me there were stars. They were bowing to me too. Ooh! Let's all bow down to Joseph. We can't ignore these dreams. After all, his last one did come true. Are you saying that Joseph belongs above all of us, even Judah? I'm not saying that, but there could be a message here. Judah's led the herd for years, brought in the wheat, raised the tents. He comes first before any of us, especially Joseph. Judah, it's not up to me. God may be telling us something of our future. Then I guess all my work doesn't matter. Watch your tongue. Jacob, Judah, please! I've had enough of this. Let's go. [sighs] Look at what your dreams have done. Don't get mad at me. I didn't ask for them. You didn't ask for this either, brother. Half-brother! Joseph! Boys! Apologize to each other! Let me talk to Joseph. [Jacob] He's just a boy. You're too harsh on him. You're always defending him! [Jacob] His dreams come from God. Joseph, you need to be more understanding of your brothers. Life is a lot harder for them than it ever will be for you. Why do you defend them? They're not even your sons. They're no less my sons than you are. We're family, all of us.

Judah! Simeon! Levi! Reuben! Where are you? [Judah] Joseph isn't fit to lead sheep. - [Levi] I agree. - [Reuben] But he's our brother. [Simeon] Half-brother. Said so himself. Judah is the one who should take over for Father. Yes, but-- Do you want a spoiled brat giving you orders? No. Can we all agree that something has to be done about Joseph? - Yes. - I agree. [grunts] Hey, everybody! The little spy is back! I wasn't spying-- Did Father tell you to check up on us? No! Maybe this was a mistake. - I just want to-- - Report on us to Father? - You're his favorite. - N-No. You look at scrolls all day while we're covered in sweat. Why is that, Joseph? Is it because we don't have pretty coats like you? - I have mine. - [grunts] That's my coat! Step aside, brothers. I'm the new head of the family. Bow before me, you sheaves of wheat! Oh, yes, Master Joseph, ruler of the world. Give it back, now! If you want your coat, why don't you go get it? - Levi's got it. - No, I don't. Judah does. - Come on! - I've got it! [yells] I've had enough of this stupid game! Joseph! Who says this is a game? What are you doing? Leave me alone! No! Stop it! - [brothers chattering] - [gasps] Oh! Ohh! [yells, groans] [coughing] [Levi] What do we do now? [brother] Are we just going to leave him down there? What are we going to tell Father? - We'll think of something. - Somebody! - Please! - Just get out of here. Maybe he can dream his way out. Don't leave me here alone! [grunts, sighs] [wolf howling] [shuddering] Aah! Aah! [grunting] [grunts] [whooshing] I knew you'd come back. [grunts] You think this is funny? Well, Father won't be laughing when he hear-- - Who are you? - Get him. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Ow! Let me go! You don't understand. - I'm from the house of Jacob. - A little scrawny, isn't he? It's hard to tell with that pretty coat on. [groans] Hmm. No, no, no, don't take my-- - [groans] - Get up! [grunts] Looks like he's never worked a day in his life. - That'll change. - [men laughing] My brothers will come for me. Judah! Simeon! Levi! - Please help me! - Joseph! We're right here. [sighs] Judah. I told you they'd come for me. As agreed, 20 pieces of silver. Judah-- Why-- No! Help me! Levi, please. Issachar. Simeon. Stop them. Judah. Judah, help me, please. Please! [slavers grunting] [Joseph grunting] Judah, please! Judah, we can't turn back now. We've gone too far. - Aah! - Hut, hut! - [brays] - [chuckles] I'm your brother! I'm your brother! Half-brother. - [slaver] Yah! - [trinkets jingling] [camel brays] [wind whistling] [wolf howling] [slavers conversing] [shivers] [gasps] - Where could he have gone? - Don't worry. I'm sure he's all right. The boys will find him. [Judah] Father. This is all we found. [gasps] Joseph! - No! Joseph! - Joseph! [gasping] - Oh, Rachel. - [sobbing] - [grunts] - Hey, wake up.

I haven't seen a finer horse in all of Egypt. I'm glad Your Excellency is pleased. There is still one small matter. Oh, yes. As we agreed. [coins jingling] Oh, forgive me, but something is not quite right. Hmm. I thought I brought the right amount. You're a busy man. Anyone can make a mistake. He's yours. Pharaoh himself would be jealous. [Potiphar] Yes, he's a fine horse. Hmm. [creaks] Master, I think you should see this. Uh-- Get away from that. Don't touch it! Well, look at that. Well, I-- It's broken. Your Excellency, I had no idea. Of course not. You're a busy man. Anyone can make a mistake. And yours is going to cost you your freedom. Please, keep the stallion as a gift from me. - No. Take him away. - [horse nickers] I have a dozen more horses! Take them all! Please, anything! Potiphar, you should keep it. You said it was the finest in all Egypt. And own a horse taken from a thief? What would that say about my honor? [scoffs] You and your honor. You've done well. What's your name? Joseph. Joseph.

Is something wrong? No. This land-- it's not Egypt. Is this your home? - Canaan. - Please, tell me more about Canaan. [sighs] This is the place where I was born. These are the sunflowers my mother planted. This is my, uh-- - My-- - Family? You miss them, don't you? My brothers. They betrayed me! Joseph, we are your family now. Huh? We care for you here. We... I feel you are special. What? No. Why have you come here tonight? - To be with you. - No. - This is not right. - Joseph, look at me. - I will not betray my master. - I'm talking to you. - No! Stop! No! - Wait! I order you to stay! No! Everything you are, you owe to me! - [panting] - [screaming] [grunts] You stood apart from the other slaves. I let you work in my home. I kept you from hard labor, and you did well for me. - Or so I thought. - Master-- No other slave was ever given this opportunity! I gave you my trust. - What do you say for yourself? - I did nothing wrong. And still you insult me with your denials! - What am I to make of this? - [sobbing] It's not what it seems. I could never betray you, Master. Such insolence! Am I to believe a slave over my own wife? I swear. I did nothing to betray you. Silence! For what you have done, you must be put to death. - See to it. - No, no. Master, I beg you. Tell him! Help me! Tell him that-- [groaning] Help me! Please! Stop. - He doesn't deserve to die. - Why? I see. [panting] - Take him to prison. - [grunts] Wait, Master. No! Please! Believe me! I did nothing wrong! This is a mistake! [grunts] [groans] I did nothing wrong. Yeah, we know you're innocent. - [squeaking] - [yelling] I know it sounds crazy, but it was so real. I was up all night with my own dreams. Now you wanna take up my day with yours? - [spits] - No. Just listen. I was back at Pharaoh's palace in a garden of grapes that had three old vines. A tear fell from my eye, and the vines drank it in. They became so thick with grapes that I squeezed them into a cup and served it to Pharaoh. That is quite a dream. - I know what your dream means. - You do? How could you? I just do. It's some kind of gift. The three vines signify three days. In three days, Pharaoh will bring you back to the palace a free man. [sighs] If only it were true. It is true. And when you're free, tell Pharaoh about my gift. Please. Promise me. Some gift. To make up fairy tales and give hope to the foolish. - Maybe he's not making it up. - All right, then. Here's one I've had every night for the last week. I'm taking three baskets of bread to Pharaoh, one on top of the other, when the baskets fall. I go to pick up the bread, when suddenly a swarm of birds come out of nowhere and attack me. They keep pecking at me in the face and the eyes. What does it mean? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. Tell me. Tell me! The three baskets also signify three days. In three days, Pharaoh will behead you, and birds will feed on your flesh. What? You're lying. You're lying! - Stop it! - [grunting] Don't pay any attention to him. We're not going anywhere. [squeaking] - [door unlatches] - [gasps] Take him. - Get up. - [grunts] You knew. You knew! That's not a gift! That's a curse! Pharaoh has summoned you to the palace. - Why? What did I do? - Let's go. It's gonna be all right. You'll see. - Tell Pharaoh about me. - I will. [grunts] - [door latching] - Don't forget me! Don't forget me! Guard! Tell them I'm still here! Answer me! [sighs] - [thunderclaps] - No one cares. [rain falling] [gasping] Asenath! [guard] Halt! Who's there? No! - [thunderclaps continue] - [squeaking] [yells] Oh, God why are you doing this to me? Do you hear me? Any kindness, you take away. You were the one who gave me the dreams. You brought me the gift. Some gift! My dreams are lies. What have I done to deserve this?

Pharaoh's butler said you interpret dreams. That is true. And? Pharaoh is tortured by a dream. None of his wise men can explain it. I'm to bring you to the palace. Potiphar? It's good to see you again. How could I have allowed this to happen? My wife-- I understand. Let's go. For the sake of Egypt, relieve my suffering. [groans] Is this the one you spoke of? Yes, Excellency. I'm told you merely need to hear a dream, and you can explain it. Not me, Your Excellency. The explanation comes from God. None of my wise men or magicians, none of my gods could help me. What makes you think your God is any different? Tell me your dream, Pharaoh. Every night it's the same. I am standing by the Nile. Seven healthy cows graze peacefully on the banks. [braying] [thunderclap] [growling] But then seven horrible, sickly cows come from the same river, the most wretched I have ever seen in Egypt. Suddenly they begin to devour the healthy cattle, and yet the cows remain as sickly as before. And then I wake up. Is there more? Yes. Another dream always follows. Seven ears of grain, full and golden, grow from a single stalk. [earth quaking] Suddenly, seven ears, hardened and scorched, spring up on the same stalk and swallow the seven good ears. All that remains are shriveled grains unfit to eat and nothing else. - Well? - Pharaoh's dreams are one. The healthy cows and ears of grain are seven years of abundance. The sickly cows and the withered grain, mean seven years of famine will follow and destroy the land. Egypt may not survive. Can this be stopped? What can be done? You must find a man you can trust. During the years of plenty, have him collect one-fifth of the grain from every field and store it under guard. Then, during the years of famine, give it back to the people. Potiphar, you trust this man? With my life, Excellency. [crowd cheering] [crowd silences] Through this man, I have seen the future of Egypt. And through his deeds, we shall prosper. [crowd cheers] I am giving him power over all Egypt. Only Pharaoh will be greater. You shall call him Zaphnath-Paaneah. God speaks, and He lives. [crowd cheering, chanting] Zaphnath-Paaneah! - [meows] - Hey. Kia, come back here. Hmm. - [Joseph clears throat] - [gasps] Zaphnath-Paaneah. Joseph.

I'm looking after her while my parents tend the sheep. Are you here for some grain too? [gasps] [laughs] - Thank you! - Bye! [whines] Here you go. - [Potiphar] Who's next? - We are, my lord. - You are not Egyptian. - No, sir. My brothers and I have traveled far, from Canaan. [panting] - Joseph, what's wrong? - Nothing. Look at you. You're shaking. It must be the sun. I'll be fine. [Judah] Please. Our wives and children are hungry. I'm sorry, but you haven't contributed to our supply. We don't ask for charity. We'll pay you with silver. - [Potiphar] How many are you? - There are 12 of us. Ten of us here. At home, we have our father and youngest brother. - [gasps] - [Potiphar] Very well. - Give them-- - [Joseph] Nothing! Ten foreigners asking for grain, no ties to Egypt. Are you thieves, hoping to see where we store our grain? Spies? I don't know what you are, but I don't believe your story. Your Excellency, everything we say is true. I swear it. Then prove it! Produce this youngest brother. - But why? - What would that prove? That you're not lying. If you're telling the truth, I'll let you buy all the grain you want. Till then, arrest this one! - [gasps] - We'll hold him until you produce this youngest brother. - Take him. - [all grunting] - [all shouting] - Stop! - Judah, help me! - [guard] No! - [Simeon] No! No! No! - [guard] Let's go. [door slams shut] Joseph, what are you doing? They're just trying to feed their families. They're thieves, here to steal our grain. [scoffs] They needed food, and they were prepared to pay for it. How can you say they're thieves? - They've done nothing to you. - [scoffs] Nothing? [sighs] - They're my brothers. - What? They sold me. They sold me into slavery. They took me away from my home. I never got to say good-bye to my mother. I never got to see my father grow old. Joseph, I-- I didn't know. You're here now. You have a home, a wife who loves you, everything you could want. No. Not everything. [door squeaking open] I thought you learned something in that cell. Remember when I would bring food to you? Yes. It kept me going. [Simeon] Hey! You won't keep me here. My brothers will come for me. [echoing] My brothers will come for me!

[door closes] [murmuring] Now remember, don't speak unless you're spoken to. - Hmm. - Don't worry. It'll be all right. Welcome. - You've done what I've asked? - Our brother, Benjamin. You kept your word. Bring out the other brother. So, Benjamin, tell me of your mother and father. My mother is no longer alive. Oh. I'm sorry. And your father? - He's worried I'm here. - Why is that? I'm a long way from home. Oh? Doesn't he trust your brothers to protect you? He likes me to stay close by. Really? Why is that? A long time ago, he-- he lost his youngest son. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen? - He was killed. - Killed? How? By wolves. - Wolves? - Yes. It broke my father's heart. Well, it must have been very hard on your brothers too. - They never speak of it. - Don't they? - Benjamin! - [brothers] Simeon! - I was beginning to worry. - [all murmuring] You must be hungry after your journey. Come. You'll be my guests. [percussive music plays] - A toast... - [music stops] to brothers. [all] To brothers! [music continues] [chattering] Stop this. You have no right. We've done nothing wrong. What's going on? Why have they been arrested? - Joseph, what are you doing? - You'll see. [grunting] Get back in place. Get back in-- I give you food. I take you into my home. And this is how you repay me, by stealing? We wouldn't steal from you. We'd never do such a thing. - Now you insult me by lying. - What? One of you has stolen from me. Benjamin. [brothers murmuring] The favored one. - I didn't take it! - Arrest him. For what you have done, you will be punished. - Someone put it in there. Ow! - Stop! Take me instead. - I beg you. - No, take me. - [all] Take me! Take me! - Take any of us, your grace, but, please, let the boy go. You would sacrifice yourselves for a half brother who's spoiled by your father? Yes. Why? Why should you care if I take him, beat him, make him a slave? Because I will not make my father suffer, again. Again? What do you mean, "again"? Our brother was not killed by wolves. We were blinded by jealousy and sold him into slavery. For 20 years, we have lived with that guilt. We can't go back without the boy. My father could not bear it a second time. And neither could we. If anyone is to be punished, it should be us. [sighs] I will not harm any of you or our father. I am your brother Joseph. - Joseph? - It's Joseph. I can't believe you're here. How can it be? Joseph? I have so much to tell you, so many questions to ask. Oh, Joseph, can you ever forgive us? I already have. Can you forgive me for thinking I was some miracle from God? But you are a miracle. God sent you to save our family and all of Egypt. - And you did. - Asenath? Please. I'd like you to meet my brothers. [all] Welcome. It's an honor. Pleasure to meet you. You will join me here, all of you, with your families. Look! - I see him! There he is! - It's him! There he is! - Joseph! - Father. Father! Father! - Father! - Joseph. - My boy. My boy. - [all murmuring] Your mother prayed this day would come, that we'd all be together again as a family. It's a miracle. Yes, Father. It is a miracle.
