We've done, I don't even know how many, but I don't know, like a million shows, and they've all been incredible, every single one. And I just wanted to thank you so much for taking the time to come to all the shows, even flying around and sharing rooms together. I know a bunch of y'all have. I see it on Twitter all the time. Uh-huh. I just want you to know that I see you and appreciate you so much, and I am so grateful. This experience has made me so happy, and I'm so grateful. So thank you for being in my life and for, um… I don't know, for making this such a special chapter for all of us. Um… I didn't think I was gonna be able to do one show and, uh… now we've done 80-something. And… [chuckles] …it's all really thanks to y'all and your energy and to everybody on this stage. My band, my dancers, my lighting crew, my sound crew, my camera guys, everybody that works here, and everybody who builds the stage. Literally everybody who works on this is fucking incredible, and I'm so grateful. I work with the best there is and the kindest people I know, and it's really a family. I'm sorry. I'm almost done. I swear to God. I'm sorry. I hate talking, but I just have to say this 'cause I don't know if I'm going to see everybody. I'm just really grateful, so thank you so, so, so much to everybody involved, to you guys, to my amazing crew, and I love you and everybody. And… everyone I love, so thank you.
