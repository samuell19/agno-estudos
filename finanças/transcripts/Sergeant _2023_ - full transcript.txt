'My son Kalim was killed by Sgt Nikhil Sharma.' 'His mistake cost my son his life.' 'Nikhil Sharma was doing his duty.' 'The police department has erred.' 'Justice for Kalim.' We cannot punish an officer like Nikhil Sharma, who suffered such a grievous personal loss. 'What can be worse than losing a son for the Akhtar family?' 'Sir, Katrina did not die. She was murdered.' 'This officer needs to be punished.' 'Can he bring my son back?' A burden Nikhil Sharma will carry forever. 'If we had not amputated your leg, we could not have saved you.' Nikhil Sharma did everything he could to save Kalim's life. In the Katrina drug overdose case, Officer Nikhil Sharma has been acquitted by the Westminster Court. The court stated that while the rapper Kalim's death was unfortunate, it was an accident. Nikhil Sharma followed the police protocol. The court has withdrawn all the charges and instructed the department to reinstate the officer. 'We went through a lot.' 'We won't forgive him.' 'I wish he goes to hell.' You were right, buddy. I should have listened to you. No, it's okay. The important thing is we've won the case. I killed him. What are those pills for? It's a bridge. What? To meet my mom. I'll have a coffee, please. No sugar. Thanks. Congratulations. Now that you are acquitted, the settlement with the police federation will also go through. You will be back with us before you know it. Are you attending the sessions with Daniella? Yeah. - Good. Thanks a lot, Linda. You've been very supportive. Haider told me how you have helped in IOPC investigations. Of course. Nick was a good cop. Linda, it looks like Peter is going to get you drunk today. Want some wine? - Yeah. Of course. Cheers. Of course. Cheers. Cheers... - I was... I am sorry. I was a good cop. You are a good cop. Then? A desk job doesn't mean you are no longer a part of the force. Desk job! Consider it a transition period. - What? There is nothing wrong with me. It's temporary. I can walk. I can do anything a normal person can. Can't you see? Hmm? You'll be back to your role soon. What's wrong with me? Nick. - I'm a handicapped now, eh? I am a cripple! Calm down, Nick. Calm down. Stay out of this! You're all in cahoots. Thanks for the party. I really enjoyed it. Do you still have fits of anger? Not at all. 'Stop doing me favours!' 'I don't need you' 'or anybody!' Are you still dependent on alcohol? I hate depending on things. So, no. I don't even touch alcohol. Do you still feel that people are staring at you? No, I think I accepted it. Do you still struggle to accept your disability? No. I'm comfortable with my body. I've accepted the truth. Do you still feel phantom pain? It's manageable. How's your relationship with your girlfriend now? How's your relationship with your girlfriend now? It's all good. We are working on it. Please. - Let me go. Don't ever call me again. Do you still blame your father for your mother's suicide? No. Coffee. - I believe all couples face issues. So did they. Christina was a good girl. She shouldn't have gone away. I'm glad she's gone. Mom should have left too. At least she would've been alive. Do you think you're ready to join the department? Yeah, I am ready. Nothing has changed as far as I'm concerned. It's all the same for me. There you go. A changed man. How are you dealing with your break-up? I don't miss Christina at all. Never. Good progress, Nick. It's nothing. Hi, sergeant. - Hi. I'll call you back. Hey! Come in. - No, I am alright. Come on. - No. I went to pick you up. But you already had left. Yeah. Everybody is excited to have you back at office. Everybody is excited to have you back at office. Yeah, looks like it. Welcome back, Nick. Hey! - How are you doing? I am alright. - Good. I am really scared. But you are the department's poster boy. 'Well, this is one of the most difficult cases' 'that our department has ever come across.' 'And me and our team worked very hard to solve Kalim's case.' And we are very proud that justice was served. Thank you. So, what were the findings of the case? The case... Well, the report is here. Read it. You've got good at drafting. Better than real. What about the man on the boat who killed Kalim? He's dead. He's dead! - Yes. The report says it's a drug case. The case is closed, buddy. Forget about it. You know, the department and the whole world know. The department got its glory, and so did I. There's no use in dwelling on it now. But you haven't lost your charm. You almost made me believe that you are my senior. Almost is a very tricky word. You know, you are there, but you are not there. You know what I mean, right? Sorry. In your case, almost right. In your case, almost right. 'Sure, Mr Sharma. - Please keep that box there.' Mrs Sharma. There was another sofa at my son's place. Where is that? We'll be getting it in the next trip, sir. What's going on? Your belongings. Since you're living here, you can use them. It was all rotting away in the other flat. Who gave you the permission to touch my stuff? I need your permission to do that! You carry on. - Wait. Oh, I forgot. You make decisions, not take permissions. Like the decision to chop off my leg. You signed the papers to chop off my leg. I think we'll leave, sir. We'll come back later. I've told you several times that there was no other option. There is reconstruction. Do you think I want you to be like this? Like what? Like a liability? Like a handicap? No. Bitter. Just send my stuff back. I'm not going to live here too long. Okay. If you want to go away, you are free to live. Like my mom was. What do you know about your mom? You were a child. Your mother was a... Hey, uncle. - Hi, Haider. Is Nick here? We were both waiting for you. We were both waiting for you. I thought we should all celebrate his first day at the office. So, I brought his favourite whiskey... And yours too. To celebrate your first day in office. Let's celebrate. Haider. I was thinking... Do you remember the body of that girl, the one we found last year and couldn't identify? That's related to Kalim's case. All the cases from the last ten years are related to his case! I am happy for you. - Thank you. I mean, a person needs only one opportunity to make it big. You know what I mean. What do you want to say? You took advantage of my hospitalisation. You took the exam... You became my senior, you know. So, what's your problem? You were my junior in school. Stop arguing over seniority, guys. Listen to the senior-most guy here. Okay, Haider. Look into Nick's case properly. Uncle, I'll handle it. Don't worry. - Yes. Just like your dad handled my mom's case. 'Friends, you must have seen the news' 'that Officer Nikhil Sharma was acquitted by the Westminster Court recently.' 'But even after seven months, I still have the same question.' 'Why was Kalim taken into custody then?' 'In fact, he was the one who called the cops.' 'And secondly, without the firearms unit,' 'why did the police involve him in their operation?' 'why did the police involve him in their operation?' 'Officer Nikhil Sharma is responsible for Kalim's death.' 'And for those who are not aware, let me inform you' 'that Nikhil Sharma is the same officer' 'who has been unable to identify' 'the dead body of a girl found two years ago.' 'Thank God for Officer Haider Ali who solved Kalim's case.' 'You can verify the details yourself...' - Good morning, dear. Why did you call him here? You know that he... His future will be ruined. Sure, uncle. You just wait here. He's our boy. Uncle called me a few times for him. - Who? Your father. Take it easy, man. Yeah, we should all stick together, right? Nick, I don't understand why you called me here. I did the right thing. I called the ambulance. You did well. Well done. Thank you, sir. When are you introducing me to your contact? Huh? Nick... Katrina didn't die of an overdose, sir. She was killed because she tried to escape. Katrina had two roommates. Mira Gupta and Eva. They can give us more links. Yeah, we have reached. Alright. Which one is it? That guy! - Yeah. Sir, I'm scared. Call him and tell him you are just around the corner. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there in a second, bro. No, don't leave. I'll be there. Haider, he is leaving. Nick, the firearms unit is on its way. Nick, the firearms unit is on its way. We'll lose him. Where have you guys reached? Another five minutes. So, I am sending him in. No, Nick. Wait. Hey, what are you doing, man? - Get down. 'Sorry, mate. But you just can't... - Help me!' 'Please help me! Bro!' 'Kalim!' 'Hi, sir.' Soro! 'Yes, sir.' I am sending you two numbers. Clone their chats on my phone. It's outside the department. 'Will be done, sir.' Eva, I've got the name of the hotel and the room number. They'll pick us up at the Aldgate Station. We'll take the tube from Piccadilly. Yeah. I see them. I see them. They got into a cab. Speak later. Follow that car. Okay. Eva, is the party today? F**k! How can I help you, sir? These two girls, Mira and Eva... They just went up the elevator. Who are they? Well, they must be guests, sir. I am a cop. You want me to get a search warrant for this property! - Hi. I am Natalie Martin. How can I help you? These two girls, Eva Lee and Mira Gupta... They just went up the elevator. I want to know where they have gone and what they are doing here. They work here, sir. Oh! You're saying they work here. She is saying they are guests here. What's going on? I want to see their work permits. I am extremely sorry, sir. But I cannot help you in this regard. Plus, it doesn't fall under your jurisdiction. Please come with the border agency. I would love to cooperate. But for now, I'll have to ask you to leave, sir. 'Business tycoon Admir Leka is a renowned social activist.' 'Because of the global scholarship program run by his Leka Foundation,' 'millions of girls all over the world get free education.' So, they were dressed like escorts. And how exactly does an escort dress? I mean... If someday I decide to wear a short dress and high heels and come to work, you will call me an escort. You know that's not what I mean, Linda. What someone wears at work is none of our business, Nick. Will she wear a short dress and high heels at the office? There is something called common sense. Stop b***ing about me. Linda, all I am saying is that... Okay. Check their employee list. Their names cannot be there on the employee list. So, you can check that out. And yes, here they are. Eva and Mira, housekeeping and catering staff. The list came through this morning from the hotel management. They made it up. You know, I have got messages. Hang on. They have been talking to each other in codes about... - What messages? Who gave you permission to check phone messages? Haider, what's going on here? I don't think this is a case, Linda. Can I just have a chat with you? Nick, come on. Let me look at the phone. I'm just... - I'll talk to him. I am just following my gut, Linda. Okay. It's a crime to tap the girl's phone without permission! I was collecting evidence, what else... What else was I doing? Look! I am going to handle this. But you have got to follow protocol. I'll follow protocol. You will follow protocol. You will follow protocol. Alright. I'll follow protocol. What do you want? You know we are on to you. Either we'll get you, or they will get you. For what? - For what? To save you from Leka. It's better to stay away for you for now. I didn't expect you to still investigating that after what happened to you. What happened to me? You must leave. What about your daughter? Her future is going to be ruined either way. Look, I'll give you an easy way out. You turn case witness, alright? I'll be home tomorrow. But come with someone who is real authority. I need some assurance. And don't call me. But, sir... - See you soon. Yes, Soro. It's me. 'Hi, sir.' Yeah, I have got another job for you. 'Yes, tell me.' I want you to find out what no one knows about Leka. 'Leka!' - No one knows. Yeah. - 'Okay.' Nick, I can't go with you. Just hear me out. I have got someone. That will go on the record. Her name is Natalie. I just want one officer, to prove to her that it is official. We got this. - No. I can't go with you, buddy. It's not possible. - Why? This case is shut. - But why? No. Listen, man. What are you doing? - Come on. I know you love me, man. Oh, come on. Don't do this. I know you want me to get better. I know you want me to get better. What have I become, man? What have I become? I am drinking all the time. I'm addicted to painkiller. Why? What are you doing? - You think it's because of this! It's for my peace of mind, Haider. You always looked out for us. Stop it. Come on. - Just please come with me. Nick. - Just come with me. For my soul, Haider. Stop it now, Nick. Shut up. Please. Just stop it, Nick. Oh, God! Okay. But, Nick, I'll do the talking, not you. Got it? I promise. Nick! Hi! - Hello, ma'am. Ma'am. - Yes. We are here... - Who are you? I am Ruby. Where is Natalie? Natalie! Who is Natalie? Natalie lives here. No. Sorry. I live here. I've been living here for the past five years. She is lying. - What? This is Natalie's house. I saw her here last night. Answer the questions, ma'am. What is this regarding? You didn't answer! What? - What have you done to Natalie? Sorry, officers. I think you've come to the wrong address. Well, if you are so innocent, you should not have a problem with looking her up in here. Normally, I wouldn't. But I am not even dressed. Normally, I wouldn't. But I am not even dressed. Get dressed then. - Wait. Sorry, ma'am. Sorry to bother you. Come, Nick. Come on. Excuse me. - Nick. Excuse me. Can you get your partner? Nick. - This is illegal. How can you enter my house without any warrant? Nick, don't... My boyfriend is sleeping upstairs. Nick, come down. This is illegal. You guys aren't allowed to do this. I know, ma'am. Stop him. - Nick, are you done? Nick, I'm waiting outside. Let's go, Nick. Nick. Haider, look what I found. This is the same scarf which Natalie wore yesterday. And ask her. Whose bag is it? That's my bag. Oh, really? She is lying, man. Let's see whose bag it is. I am not lying. - That's enough. Let's go, Nick. - Come on. What do you mean? - Sorry about this, ma'am. We must follow protocol! - Protocol! Whose side are you on? Nick, get in the car. Come back. I am going to the hotel. Excuse me. I'd like to speak to the manager. Yeah, sure. Just a second. She's coming here. This is our manager. Hello! Hi! Good day, officers. How can I help you? She's not the one. We're here to meet Natalie, not her. Excuse me. What? She's not the one. Natalie. - What? Natalie. - What? Martin Natalie. I'd like to speak to Natalie Martin, please. Natalie is currently on a leave. She went on holiday I suppose with her family. Okay. So... She's lying. They're all in cahoots. Address. Where has she gone? I'd like to have her whereabouts. If you could help us with that? Her address? We need to speak to her urgently, ma'am. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to give out any personal information. But I do have her visiting card. You can call her. - Okay. That would do. Thank you so much. No problem. - Sorry to bother you. Thanks. Here it is. This number is unavailable. Come. Let's go. - Hang on. There must be some record, some email... There must be something, man. If she has gone on holiday... If she has gone on holiday... We will go to the office and search. Can't do it here. Come, Nick. - Why? We are here, Haider. No. - Haider. You promised! Wait... I need to call you back. - Call her. Sorry. What? - Somebody would know where she is. Call her right now. Nick. - Call her. Excuse me, ma'am. I know you can't give us her number. But could you kindly call her? I can speak to her. Is that okay with you? It's a request. You can say no. Of course, sir. - Okay. Hi, Natalie. I am so sorry to disturb you during your leave. Would you please speak to officer... Haider. - Haider? Alright. Thank you. Hi, Natalie. This is Officer Haider. I'd like to have... - 'Say it again.' Where are you? I am looking for you. - 'I can't hear you.' Hello, Natalie. - 'Hello.' Nick. - 'Hello. Are you there?' Nick. - 'Hello. Are you there?' That's not her voice. Sorry, ma'am. Sorry. Nick, I am done with you. - That's not her voice. Haider. They've made her disappear, Haider! Where are you going? Are you okay? Can I give you a hand? What happened? "My legs are tired now..." "Let us take a little halt..." "My legs are tired now..." "My legs are tired now..." "Let us take a little halt..." "There is a long night ahead." "Let us sleep for a few more moments." Haven't you got enough drinks in already? Haider told me what happened today. Uncle, I'll go. Thank you. Where are you going? - Home. Why? Is this not your home? Alright. This is not your home. He's not your father. And guess what? This is not your life! It's my life, Haider. It's my case. - Stop it, Nick. How does it feel to be Nick? I made you what you are today. I requested Linda to keep you on the team. 'Keep Haider, Linda. Please.' - That's enough, Nick. Wait. - Nick, don't touch me. Since when do you know Admir Leka? You were the only person I had told about Natalie. And the next thing I know, she disappears. she disappears. Stop it, Nick. You are crossing the line. Did you know I was going to get hurt? That's why you didn't get there on time. Shut up, Nick. - Haider. Sorry, uncle. Haider, let it go. I apologise to you on his behalf. You... Stop pretending to be so good. Stop faking such decency. You two deserve each other. 'Well, it was quite tough.' Shall I escort you in? No. 'Happy birthday.' 'Thank you.' 'Ladies and gentlemen,' 'my amazing fiancé Nick Sharma is on the cover of the Top Cop.' 'Amazing!' 'The number of comments he is getting is crazy.' 'Look at that. And this is nothing.' 'If you check his DMs,' 'look how many he is getting.' 'But the biggest fan award of all the fans out there' 'has got to go to this Indian girl Monica.' 'has got to go to this Indian girl Monica.' 'Look at that. All the messages are from her.' 'She is obsessed with you.' 'What a stalker! - You know that.' 'This is true love, my friend.' 'True love.' Does it matter to you how the world sees you? Why? They see me with love and lust. Actually, only lust. How do you see me? Sad. Calm down now. Everything is going to be fine. 'Okay. Please hurry.' 'Can you please take a left now? - Move.' 'We need to get through... - Let's hurry.' 'Vitals? - Ready for amputation surgery.' 'The consent form is already signed by the patient's father.' 'The consent form is already signed by the patient's father.' 'Proceed with anaesthesia.' 'Could you get the cannulation tray, please?' Are you okay? What happened? It's okay. I understand. Get out! 'This officer needs to be punished.' 'Can he bring my son back?' Hey, Soro. Hi, Nick. Sir, are you alright? I stayed up all night and researched this Leka. And he's a horrible man. Horrible! Very bad! Do you know he paid a million as a bribe to avoid charges in a child prostitution racket? Child prostitution! Disgusting! And this Leka Foundation is the prostitution racket. They target young girls from poor families. Give them scholarships. Why? Because even if they went missing, no one is going to search for them. Powerful man! Devil! One more thing. DJ Kalim always held his shows in the club owned by Leka. Because they were using him to sell drugs to the young generation. And that Natalie... She would select the girls. She worked for Leka... - Let's go for a drink. Morning. How are you? Here you go. Enjoy your drinks. Sir, you never used to drink so much. It's for the pain. Good stuff. I am going. Keep digging, eh? - Okay. 'In a daring raid today, supercop detective Sgt Nikhil Sharma' 'In a daring raid today, supercop detective Sgt Nikhil Sharma' 'single-handedly busted a drug racket in Westminster,' 'arguably one of the most notorious parts of London.' 'And while some feel his method...' Human trafficking, drugs... I know that Leka is the boss, but... Please stop this, sir. You know who I am? I must ask you to leave. - Leg man! Do you know who I am? Last night, a police officer picked a fight with the security at the Admir Business Centre. at the Admir Business Centre. What do you have to say about that? Where is your badge, Nick? Where is your badge? I left it at home. A can driver submitted it to the station. Yeah, I never got a cab. You've got to stop drinking, Nick. It's reacting with your medication. Nick, this is serious. You're looking a suspension and a departmental inquiry. You're grounded. No more cases for you. You're grounded. No more cases for you. Finally, you connected with me! So many voice notes... You should've called me instead. Human trafficking, drugs... I know that Leka is the boss, but I don't have proof, Monica. People say my mom died by suicide. Haider's father, Uncle Zain, he covered up for my father. But there is a file. Which Uncle Zain tried to cover up... The day I open it, Monica, I'll shoot my father. I feel so alone, Monica. I am so sorry. I should know better than sending you these messages. But you know, Haider is the happiest. My leg was amputated. Christina did the right thing when she left me, you know. I don't need anyone, Monica. Not my father, not Haider, nor you. Hi! I was drunk. I don't know what I said in those voice notes. I know. Forget it, you know. I'll forget it. Done. Don't you think you're running away from the truth? What truth? The truth about you. Your truth. What is my truth? What you are... Magnum opus. What does that mean? God's best creation. The more pain you endure, the purer you emerge. Pain is beauty. So, just embrace it. There is... Someone is at the door. I'll call you later. Sure. May I come in? Office, day 1. Number of cars passing. Blue cars: 5. Black cars: 8. So, this is what you're busy with. So what? Any problem? Inspector. I've come here for uncle. Why don't you answer his calls? Uncle has invited us all to dinner at his restaurant. Let's go. I am hungover. Look, uncle is old now. Let go of your grudges. Else you would regret it like me. For so many things, I wanted to say sorry to my father, but... I would've apologised, but my dad passed away before I could. You're blessed that uncle is still with you. Nick. Let's go home. I am not hungry. Hi, Kumar. How are you? I am good. How are you? - Good... Did you bring holy offerings for me from Vaishnodevi? Of course, sir. - Come. Let's go to the bar. Thank you so much. - You're at my restaurant, buddy! Listen, don't charge them. - Thank you. Enjoy yourself. Did you cool it? - No, sir. Did you cool it? - No, sir. You know Nick doesn't eat hot food. Sorry, sir. I'll cool it. - Go. Hmm. So, how have you been? You don't come over anymore! Was there a fight between you two? Haider never tells me anything. Me neither. Maybe Uncle Ravi knows. Okay. Let's do this. So, this is a very special Japanese single malt whisky, 18 years old. Exclusively for you. My father had saved it for a special occasion. So, I decided to make today's occasion special. My dear wife. - Thank you, sir. Nick, do you what to try some? Okay. - Cheers to dad. Cheers. - Cheers. Zain... Oh, wow! Zain always put others before himself. He did so much for the people of our community. Yes. If you wanted to stay with the community, why did you come here? What does it mean? If you go to a new place, you should mingle with them. It's this herd mentality... Staying in a herd, afraid to make your own path... Haven't I made my own path? This grand restaurant I own didn't build itself. Zain also made his own path. Inspired by him, he joined the police force. 'Stop.' 'I am a supercop now.' 'Supercop Nick Sharma on duty.' What about mom's life? What about it? Do you think I forgot how you treated mom because she wasn't from your community? Let it go, Nick. I am letting it go. There's only one criminal who's got away from me. Criminal! Am I a criminal? Yes. The day I open mom's file, I will prove it as well. You got away because of Uncle Zain. You know, community... Hey, you should take it easy when Uncle Ravi speaks of the community. But you won't get it. You are a half-Indian. So are you. I am Bangladeshi. Same thing, isn't it? Nick, what has happened to you lately? No one's able to get through to you. You're addicted to painkillers. Nick, excessive consumption of painkillers is negatively affecting your brain. Do you understand? I see my mother. I saw Uncle Zain last night. She talks to me daily. You should put me in an asylum, Haider. Nobody needs me except for my mom. For everyone else, I might as well not exist. Alright, Nick. Let's go in. Come. Nick. Nick. Darn! Why me? Oh my God! Why me? Hi! I waited for so long yesterday. You didn't call me. I waited for so long yesterday. You didn't call me. I was with family. That's why you look so upset. I got it. It's like a jail you often want to escape from but can't. 'It's going to be okay, baby.' 'It's going to be okay.' 'Don't be scared, baby. - Okay.' 'JD, go home.' 'No, Mr Zain. We are not going home.' 'JD, I said go home.' 'Stop it. I say!' 'Ravi wants her to return home.' My mom could never escape from that jail. Is that why she killed herself? I told you. It's my dad. But how can you be so sure that he did it? That he is responsible. I am dead sure. My mom's file has all the answers. 'But I don't have the courage to open it.' I don't have the courage either. I can't escape either. Because he'll kill me. Who? James. - James! My husband. I have to go. I'll call you. 'Stop pretending.' 'They warned me against marrying... - Just stop it.' 'an orthodox Indian, but I wouldn't listen.' 'And you betrayed me, Ravi. - Stop it, please.' 'You are not leaving the house.' 'Ravi.' 'Please come back.' 'You're just going to leave me here, Ravi. Is that what you're going to do?' 'You're going to leave me here!' 'Is that why I am a prisoner for you now? Ravi.' 'You are dead to me.' 'You are dead to me.' Look at me! Look at me! Well, well... It's Long John freaking silver! Get lost. Get lost. What the hell are you saying, bro? Get lost. Now, stay away from Leka Business. Or I'll break your other f**king leg too. Forget Leka! James was at home yesterday. So... Are you in danger? I am. Then why did you say he'd kill you? This is not your case. What's that? I can help you. You can take legal action. My lawyer Mark is very good. He'll help you. No. Promise me that you won't say a word to anyone about this. I have to go. See you. Hello... 'You are not leaving the house.' What's going on? You don't even deserve her memories. My mom won't stay here anymore. Nick, no. Don't take this picture. Don't take this picture. No. Nick, no! No, not that one... Nick! You are hurting me! Nick! This was the day I had to see. Get out. Where are you? I am worried. 'Monica' 'The person you called is not reachable.' 'Hello. You've reached Monica and James Phillip.' 'Please leave a message after beep.' Hey! What happened? I went in to collect my mom's stuff from my dad's place. All the photographs, all her clothes, all her memories... She couldn't fight back. Like you... I am fine. Do you know the difference between our thoughts? I have accepted my fate with humility, and you have accepted it with defeat. and you have accepted it with defeat. That's why I am okay like this. Have I? How could you accept defeat? Why did you give up your fight against fate? 'Who are you talking to?' No one, honey. How do I accept it? 'I am super Nick. Look, mummy. I am powerful.' 'Remember, power is not in the cape.' 'Where is it? - Here.' 'That's right.' 'That's right.' Hey! First of all, thanks to you, I am back on track. And I have started fighting again. The way I have planned everything, these guys are going to behind bars, man, in no time. That's great. I like this version of you. You're like a hero. I have so much to tell you. I want to see you. I will speak to you later. 'Hi, Nick. - Hey, Soro. I need a very urgent favour. I need to track a number. On my phone. Right now. - 'Got it.' What are you doing here? I need to see you. - Not now. So, when? I'll text you. Hi. Here you go. I am sorry. You suddenly showed up there yesterday, and I got scared. Yeah, I know. I am sorry. I shouldn't have shown up like that. Me too. I should go. Yes. Alright. Now, you are a Member of Parliament, Peter Johnson. The code is table 14. Means room 14. Are you sure they are not going to find out? I created this ID through their system. That means it's foolproof. Their lives are at stake here, Soro. Trust me. I think I am in the wrong room. I should leave. No, you are in the right room. Sit down. Sir, yesterday, you were... Don't be afraid. Please have a seat. Sir, I'm just a student. Please let me go. And if you go downstairs so soon, how will you explain it to them? Sir, I'll tell them there was nobody in the room. That means someone is waiting downstairs. What? - Look, if you give me evidence against them, you'll end up helping countless girls. Just trust me. If you trust me and tell me, I can help you. Sir, I'm trapped in this country. I had come here for my studies. When I got here, they snatched my password from me. They snatched my phone. And I don't know where they took my sister. I don't know where she is. If you want, you can go. Can you really help me? Yes. Do you know this man? Natalie introduced me to him. 'Girls are promised scholarships and brought here.' 'But actually...' 'It's a prostitution racket run by that man Leka.' - She is sexy. 'They're very bad people.' 'My roommate Katrina tried to escape.' 'But these people killed her.' 'Natalie trains us all.' 'And then, at secret parties, clients select the girls they want.' 'And then politicians, businessmen, diplomats...' 'We are sent to them.' How many have you sold so far? - Four. 'So, there are old men. They touch us. They hit us.' 'So, there are old men. They touch us. They hit us.' 'They do whatever they want to do with us.'

Why don't you come over and sit next to me? Sure. Wow! We have a deal. Come with us. We can sort out the details later. - Of course. Nick. Nikhil Sharma, is that right? Are you looking for someone? No. It's a shame you lost your leg, your position, your fiancée, Christina. Yeah! What a beauty! But too old. I wish I'd have known her in her teenage. How delicious she would have been at that tender sweet age! You shouldn't have let her go. But the biggest shame is that you let that kid die. On the house. - Yes, Mr Leka. By the way, the girl you are looking for, she has already been found. Logan Place, Earls Court. Step back, please, sir. - Excuse me. We are not issuing any comment at this time. Someone just made it through. Stop them. 'You don't see it the coincidence!' 'Natalie tried to help me.' 'She disappeared.' 'Mira Gupta helped me.' 'She is dead.' Nick, the Mira Gupta murder case was a case of robbery. And we've caught the culprit too. The case is closed, Nick. Just like Kalim. Reporting. - Nikhil Sharma is reporting a crime. Aagh!

After that, Admir Leka's pictures with young girls from his staff are going viral on the internet. Based on these allegations, Leka Industries stocks have fallen down the second day in a row. Sources tell us that Admir Leka is going to sue the London Metro Police. is going to sue the London Metro Police. Wow, Nick! You did it. You're all over the media! The media won't spare him. Now, they'll have to take action against Leka. Everyone will take you seriously now. And do you know? You've inspired me too to stand up for myself. Now, I want to fight. I want to leave James. Really? Yeah. So, tell me. What should I do? Mark, the lawyer who handled my case, is very good. And he'll legally save you from James. That's all you have to do. Yeah. Call Mark. - Yes. Well, I had to go on social media. Well, I had to go on social media. I approached you for help many times. No one heard me. And Natalie is probably dead. That's because of you and you. May I? Leka Enterprise, Leka Universities, Leka Foundation... He's got Leka Charity. And all of them involve young underage women. All we have to do is trace the money. And we'll find out what's going on. It's the biggest wholesale human trafficking racket. That's going on right under our noses... - Linda... Under the pretext of... - Can I talk to you, guys? Linda, Haider and Rob, I'll ask you to step out. And you too. Linda, this is Natalie Martin and her legal team. Linda, this is Natalie Martin and her legal team.

'It's a text message from Mr Admir Leka himself.' Natalie has registered a case of harassment. And Admir Leka is suing you and our department for defamation. There's only one way you and the police department can get away. His lawyers want you to go to his office and apologise personally. And you must do that, Nick. Otherwise, we will all lose our jobs. 'Monica' 'Nick,' 'I can't handle things anymore.' 'Please meet me urgently. Please.' 'Please.' There is a left here. Please step back. Come on. - Coming through. We do not believe there was any foul play. Her husband is no longer a suspect. We believe it was self-inflicted. Copy that. Make a suicide report. Who is it? Yes. You killed her! What are you doing? Stop! No! Stop! No. 'This video is recorded for documentation' 'and evaluation purpose.' 'The patient, Monica Phillip, is suffering from schizophrenia' 'and histrionic personality disorders' 'and has a high tendency to get violent.' 'Monica, easy. - It doesn't hurt.' 'Does it hurt you? I am fine. - Relax.' 'What about aliens? Are you in touch with aliens?' 'The aliens! I mean, they are my bosses. They are not my friends.' 'Please tell me about James.' 'I love James.' 'He is so lovely. He really takes care of me.' 'He is like everything you want in a man.' 'It would have been nice' 'if I could take James to meet the aliens.' I am sorry. Come, Nick. I know this is very insulting to you. But everyone's job is at stake. Do it for us. - Sure. And please stay calm there. And please stay calm there. Don't get angry. Just make it back into the department. We'll both deal with him then. Have a seat. I'll be back. Good morning. Please stretch your hands. Are you carrying any metallic objects? Okay. Thank you. This way. Wait there. Mr Sharma. Please come. I will be in Paris by 6 o'clock. But I have some business. I only have one hour. But we can talk on the plane to Singapore. But we can talk on the plane to Singapore. Of course. Okay. It will be beautiful. Yes, but... We meet once again. Don't take this personally. I have to do this to maintain my reputation. Let's forget the past and begin anew. But first, I have to show you something. This... This is my gift to you. The one case you never solved... The teenage girl's dead body you couldn't identify... This is her. I am always against killing. But sorry, mate... But sorry, mate... I have to record it. This is going to be public, just like you did. My name is Sgt Nikhil Sharma. I unconditionally apologise... Do you want a drink? Sure. I read mom's file. 'Amy Sharma suicide report' Why did you hide the truth from me that my mom was a bipolar and schizophrenic patient and a drug addict? You were protecting me from the truth. Not you. I was protecting Amy. It was not easy to love her. It's not easy to love anyone who is suffering. I kept blaming you. And kept loving your mom. That's all I ever wanted. That's all. Mom used to always keep talking about superheroes. I couldn't see that... You are the real superhero, dad. I am sorry... I am sorry... Nick. Nick. Nick, what happened? Oh, my God! You are hit, Nick. You will be proud of me, dad. I unconditionally apologise for... Not realising that not all superheroes wear capes. I am sorry. You what? I am a magnum opus. Pain is beauty. I am blessed. Uncle, move away, please. Haider, I've called an ambulance. Nick is badly hurt. I am very blessed. I could say sorry to my dad. I love you, dad. Nick! Nick!
