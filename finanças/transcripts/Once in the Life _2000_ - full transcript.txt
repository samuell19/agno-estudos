Tony, voice-over: Now, a lot of you guys might be surprised at what I'm about to say. And you'll want to know, who is this guy that talks so sly, and where did he learn to play? Well, I'm about to tell you the way that I failed... And the dirty trick that fate played on me. These are swinging sounds I'm running down so you will dig my history. [Rap music playing] Man: Come on, Manny. Show them what you got, baby. Manny: Yeah, I told you. Oh, yeah, chino. [Speaking spanish] Be jamming it! Be jamming it! Oh, look at that! Sammy sosa!

They were all, like, "yo, please, Freddie. Hook me up, man. I'm sick." But I was hard, just like you told me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen. I'm putting Hector on a run. I want you to go with him. Damn it, Manny. What? You said you would hook me up with my own franchise, man. Why do I got to deliver with Hector? Because he's my nephew and I don't want anything to happen to him, ok? Now I want you go with him, make sure the shit gets delivered, then maybe...Hey. Maybe we'll talk about a franchise. Yeah. How many keys? Cuatro. Ok. Make sure they get there. Yeah. No problem. Get the fuck out of here. Oye, gato. You fuck up on this one, that's another life you lose. Woman: Aah! Fuck me. Oh, yeah, taxi, taxi, taxi! Come on. Over here. Over here. I'm going to Livingston street. Where's that? In tribecka? No, no, no. Downtown Brooklyn. Oh, no, no. I'm sorry, no. I cannot take you to Brooklyn. What do you mean you can't take me? It's quitting time in one half hour. I cannot take you to Brooklyn. I must go to queens. You must take me to my destination. I'm going to Brooklyn. Let's go. No, no. I must ask you to leave my cab now, please. You either take me to Brooklyn, or you take me to the police station. I cannot go. Either you take me to Brooklyn, or take my ass to the police station. Otherwise, I'm not getting out of your cab. Can we move this along with a little alacrity? I got to take a fucking piss. What's this jackoff's name? Michael Williams. Want to write it in fucking braille? Oh, excuse me. Gentlemen, could you please escort Mr. Williams to the holding tank? [Men arguing] Woman: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please! What seems to be the problem here? Officer, I would like to fill out a complaint. Oh, would you now? That's right. This pendejo picked me up-- refused to take me to my destination. Cab driver: No. My off-duty light was on. This guy got in while I'm stopped at a red light. Liar. The man is lying. All right. Shut up! Shut up! Before I fucking smack you. You want to fill out a complaint? I need your name. Michael Williams. What's the problem, officer? No problem at all. I just have to ask you a few questions. That's all. What kind of questions? Just some routine questions, sir, starting with your name. I told you before. Michael Williams. Michael Williams Leon? No, no. Lay-on. What about my complaint? We'll get to that in a minute. Date of birth, October 31, 1967? What's this about? This is about you, nitwit. Michael Williams Leon? You got a list of prior arrests dating back 10 years, but who's counting? I didn't do nothing. Not today, but you did a bullet on riker's a couple of years ago, and that's the good news. You want to hear the bad news? You ain't been to see your p.O. In two months. Now you know what that means, don't you? He misses me? Woman: Move it. All you got to do is call on him. I was going to see him. Look, don't I at least get a phone call? I got something better. Williams! Come here! I got someone here I want you to meet. Daddy? What? What? Billy, stay here, all right? Just going to stay in the car? All right. Stay here. Jackie. Jackie! Hey! Come on, Jackie. Hey. Hey, come on. Man: There. Hey, Mikey. Give your daddy a kiss. Come over here. Come on. Excuse me, but you haven't seen this kid but twice since he's been born. Now all of a sudden, you want to come around here and play daddy? Jesus, he's my kid, too, for Christ's sakes. Come on. That's not what you said to me when I told you that I was pregnant. Fuck you, Billy. Whoa! Why you got to talk to me like that in front of the kid? Why? Because you are just such a fucking asshole. Don't you come stepping into my life and telling me that you care about my son. Hey, "our" son. Tony, voice-over: Dig. Like last new year's night, when the whole scene shown bright and all the goons was stalking their prey. The cold was pure crime on them neon lights and all the tricks were doomed to pay. Crime suddenly begun soon as daughters made sons. Some of them's only 5 years old. You know, there's been many, many a night I had to settle for a bite off of some old... Moldy roll. Seen your father lately? He's dead. He's dead? You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Positive? Absolutely. Absolutely positive. A fucking deadbeat. A fucking prick is what he was. Are you hungry? You want to go get a slice of pizza or something? Come on. Take a walk with me. I'll buy you a slice, all right? That's all right. I'm good. Like you got something better to do? Come on. Take a walk with me, bro. Ok. But don't call me that. What can I do you fellas? Let me get two slices and a coke. What you want to drink, bro? Dr. pepper. Dr. pepper? You need something with vitamin c, yo. Hey, let me get an orange drink with that. Man: 10 minutes on the pizza. Yeah. No problem. What? Look at you. Wipe your nose. Thanks. You know you got to eat, bro. Feed a cold, starve a fever. That's what they say. I fucking told you not to call me that. Now, see, look what you did. Are you stupid or what? Why the fuck you got to talk to me like that? You put me back another 10 minutes. I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry. It does nothing for me. "You're sorry." You know what? Get out. What? We just want some pizza, man. Oh, get a fucking haircut. Two of you are knuckleheads. Aah! What the fuck! Fuck, man! Torch: Say it to my fucking face. Who's stupid now, motherfucker? Wait a minute. We got to go. We got to go. The cops are coming. What are you talking about? What cops? The ones behind me, yo. Holy shit. Officers: Hold it! Hold it! Police! Stop right there! Police officer! Stop! Get the fuck out of the way! Torch: Wait up, man. Wait up. How did you know those cops were coming? I got eyes in the back of my head. 20/20 Mike. That's me. What's the matter with you? What? Are you fucking crazy? You're trying to get us busted again? We just got out, man. Yeah, well, I may be crazy, but I ain't stupid. What do you mean "we" just got out? We ain't together. Come on. Don't be like that, bro. Don't fucking call me that. Just because my old man was fucking your mother don't make us brothers. Oh, wait a minute. Why you got to talk about my mother, huh? Why you got to talk about my mom? Ha ha ha! Fucking asshole. You fucking put your hands up to me again, I'll throw you a fucking beating you'll never forget. I'm sorry, all right? Look. You're pretty good with the smitties, right? Maybe we could make some money together. Doing what? This and that. A little flim, a little flam, you know. I don't know. What? Like you got something better to do, Mr. Williams? Cut me a break with that Mr. Williams shit. Ok. Whatever the fuck your name is. Billy. Billy? Yeah. Billy. You want to make some money or not? Ok. What you want from me, Max? You know what I want? I want you to do what you fucking promised. It's not that fucking complicated. You say you're going to do something, you do it. It's not my fault. Whose fault is it? Mine? No. And I bet you won't tell her you won't take her trick-or-treating. Maxine! Maxine what? I knew this shit was going to happen. It's the same fucking shit that happened last year. Look. I got business to take care of. You're going to have to take her this year. You know what? She doesn't want me to take her. She wants her father to take her. All right? She's a little girl. Halloween is important to her. I know that. Think I don't know that? Why don't you fucking act like it? She's not going to be little forever. Where you going? Where you going? Going to pick her up from school. This is bullshit! Now just stop it, all right? Max...You know the game. I'll be back. I'll be back as soon as I can. Just do what you got to do. Come here. Don't be scared. It'll be ok. You go get precious. Tell her daddy's sorry. Will you do that for me? Yeah. I'll do that for you. I'll tell her you're sorry. Maxine: I don't know why I'm with your sorry ass anyway. Tony, voice-over: Wayward daughters for dollars and quarters would sell their youthful selves, and in the morning they awoke to find their hearts near broke, crying themselves to death. While junkies prowl with a tiger's growl in search of their much needed blow, and winos cringe on their canned heat bins to find their graves in the snow. Where belles of vice sell love for a price and even the law gets corrupt, man, you keep on trying. But nevertheless crime, like gin--what a bitter cup. The jungle creed says, "the strongest feed off of any prey at hand," and I was branded "beast" at every feast, before I ever became a man. [Bell rings] They're here. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Positive? Absolutely. Absolutely positive. Go upstairs. Wait for my call. Man on TV: Hey, all right! I'm here. You're here. We're all here together. Do you have any idea what we're doing here? Hey, Michael. You know? All right! That's what we're going to do! [Knock on door] Hi, Catherine. Hi, bill. Bill: How are you today? Are you hungry? Happy Halloween, fellas. Trick or treat. Hey, come on, man! You think I'm fucking stupid, b? Fuck. This is the kid from the elevator. Yo, where the fuck is Freddie? He's downstairs. He's on lookout. Hey, man, I ain't packing nothing. I ain't packing nothing, ok? How you doing? Good. Yeah. Listen. You guys want to show me the product or what? Hector: No doubt. Esta bien. Oh, so it's money time though, right? It's money time. So why don't you call your boy and we get this money and we do this? [Rings] Yeah? It's that time. You ready, bro? Don't fucking call me that. Well, come on up. We're waiting. Keep your fucking shirt on, Mikey. I'm coming, all right? Hurry up. These guys want their fucking money, all right? Yeah. Heard you twice the first time. [Horn honks] Damn!

Boy, these guys know how to play along real well... You sure this is where we're supposed to meet them? Yeah, I'm sure. [Siren] You positive? Absolutely. Absolutely positive. Yeah. We can't wait here all night. Yeah. Tell me about it. [Car engine revs] Who you calling? A friend of mine. [Rings] Hello. Mike: Trick or treat. Precious, how you doing? Hello. Go put your costume on.

Let me talk to Tony. Well, Tony's not here. Listen, can you tell him to meet me later tonight? Maxine: Well, Tony's taking care of business, and I don't know where to reach him. Max, please, Max. I'm in trouble now, all right? That's the fucking problem. You always in trouble. That's the only time we ever hear from you. I know, Max, and I'm sorry. I just-- you just what? You in jail again? No. No, it's just... It's my sister. Debbie? Yeah. She's shooting dope again, and listen, can you tell Tony to meet me at the old spot tonight? Help me look for her maybe? Please. Yeah, all right. I'll tell him you called. Thanks, Max. [Dial tone] Yeah. Give precious a big hug for me, all right? Operator: If you need help, hang up and then dial-- what's up? Who was that? Never mind. Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here. ¶ Take me, help me ¶ ¶ I wish I was a child again ¶ ¶ pack lunch before my boots ¶ ¶ so colorful ¶ ¶ so colorful ¶ ¶ kaleidoscope images ¶ ¶ 1975 films and starsky and hutch ¶ ¶ God, do I ask for too much? ¶ ¶ too much? ¶ ¶ God, do I ask for too much? ¶ ¶ God, do I ask for too much? ¶ ¶ God, do I ask for too much? ¶ ¶ God, do I ask for too much? ¶ ¶ yeah, yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ yeah, yeah ¶ ¶ all I want to see is the rising sun ¶ ¶ the rising sun ¶ ¶ the rising sun ¶ ¶ all I want to see is the rising sun ¶ ¶ oh, no, no ¶ ¶ the rising sun ¶ ¶ oh, no, no, no ¶ ¶ all I want to be is the rising sun ¶ ¶ the rising sun, the rising sun... ¶ Mike: Ok, ok. Ok, ok, ok. You made it, Mikey. You made it. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey, we made it. All you got to do is calm the fuck down. Think, baby. You just got to think. Yo, Billy, where the fuck are you? Hurry up. I'm coming. I'm coming. Keep your shirt on, Mike. It's fucking dark up here. You almost there. You can make it, bro. I told you not to call me that. You sure we're going to be safe up here? Yeah, I'm sure. Torch: Huh? Oh, shit. This is it? This is your fucking hideout? Yeah, yeah, this is it. Go ahead. Make yourself at home. You sure Manny won't come looking for us here? Yeah, I'm sure. You positive? I'm telling you, absolutely. Absolutely positive. Let me tell you something. It looks like quite a few people found your little fucking hideaway here. Will you just go ahead and sit down? Yeah, yeah. I'll do that. Let me tell you something else. I sure as shit ain't taking my shoes off in this joint. God forbid, I get fucking aids. What are you so fucking worried about, huh? I don't know. What if Manny and his boys find us? What about that, huh? Mierda, look it, I told you. This place is like fucking fort knox. Nobody comes in our out unless they know the way. All right? Me and my man Tony, we used to hide out here all the time. What you keep saying. Are you sure nobody saw us? Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Damn place is a mess. No shit. I don't know if I like this. I think we should blow. I think we should get the fuck out of here. And do what? What, you want to ride the fucking subway till somebody spots us? No. We take our chances on the street. We're better off. I'm telling you. No. Forget about it. We got half the dealers in the city looking for us probably, not to mention the cops. We got to do some fucking thing. At least get out of New York. To Jersey, Philly, maybe Miami. I hear the weather's nice. Miami? Miami? What are you, fucking crazy? Manny's got connections up the ass on the east coast. We got to go out west. California, Seattle, maybe. Maybe this guy Tony, the friend you called, maybe we could sell the shit to him. No way. No way. Tony's out of the life now. Let me tell you something. Once you got a taste of the life, that's it. Once in the life, always in the life, Mikey. Not my man Tony, man. He's out. Lucky motherfucker. Oh, we used to come up here all the time back in the day. Me, him, fucking Freddie. Fucking Freddie nine lives. A piece of work, he is. Catch that motherfucker, throw him off a roof. Freddie: Aah! I don't know nothing. I don't know nothing. I swear I don't know anything. I swear to God, please! Come on, Freddie, who was it? Come on. Freddie: I don't know nothing, man. I swear to God. You don't tell me, I'm going to throw you off this fucking roof. Tell me. Please, Manny, please. I don't know anything. Oh, God, no! Hey, Buddha, don't cats usually land on their feet? Yeah, but at this height, I don't know. No, Manny, please. Don't drop me, Manny. Don't kill me. Not like this, Manny, please. Drop him. No! No! No! It was Mike! It was Mike, 20/20 Mike! Come on, Freddie, stop fucking around. Come on. The other guy, huh? It was some crazy white boy with long hair, a dope fiend. I swear that's all I know, Manny. Oh, my God, don't... 20/20. Ain't that Tony's boy? Yo, Manny. I ain't seen this cat in, like, years, you know what I'm saying? Freddie: I swear. Don't drop me. I swear to God! Please. It's ok, Tony. Really, it's ok. Freddie: Oh, my God, don't kill me, Manny. Please, not like this! Ruffhouse, Buddha, why don't you take Freddie downstairs and hang out, huh? Me and Tony got to talk. I can't believe he fucking left us hanging, man. Cocksucker said the job would be a cinch. Said it would be easy. Now look at us sitting here in a fucking firetrap. It would have been a cinch if you'd have chilled the fuck out. Don't fucking start with me. I can't believe you fucking shot those guys. How many fucking times are you going to say it? You fucking shot two kids, man. I can't believe that. Forget about it, will you? What's done is done. Yeah. You came to me about a year ago. You asked for your own franchise. I gave it to you, and what happens? Is this how you show your fucking appreciation? Manny, you got to believe-- shut the fuck up! Just keep on talking. Keep on talking. Freddie: Don't hit me--ohh! Now, I know this motherfucker set me up. Now, I know he's responsible for Hector. All I want to know is when, where, why, what, who. Come on. I got to the hotel, all right? [Cell phone ringing] Yeah. Yeah, baby. No. Look, Max, I'm kind of tied up right now, ok? How's your hand, bro? Stop calling me that. I ain't your brother. So it's like that now? You bet your ass it is. You're a sick man, Mr. Williams. I told you not to call me that. Yep. You're a very sick man. I'm not sick. Just got a cold, and my fucking hand's killing me. Come on, Tony. Where the fuck are you? I think I know where they are, Manny. That's good, Tony. Now we're going to talk about how you should handle it. Me? Yeah, you. I can't do that, man. Why is that? I ain't never killed nobody before, man. Well, guess what, Tony. There's a first time for everything. What? It's your product we're talking about here. It's your responsibility. You wanted to be your own boss, right? Guess what. You got to pay the cost if you want to be the boss. You take that with you. Fuck this sitting around waiting for your friend to show up. God forbid, Manny and his boys find us. Forget it. They'll fucking have us for breakfast. Hold up. Hold up. What the fuck is that? What? Listen. What the fuck is that? I don't know. Maybe it's your friend. No. That's something else. I know I've heard that sound before. So what are you asking me for? I don't know-- shh! Shh! Wait. Oh, shit! Fuck! That's a fucking rat, man. Don't do that shit, man! I'm telling you, that's a fucking rat, man. I hate rats. I can't stand them shits. I remember I was dating this girl. She lived down by mill basin-- candy brown. Bitch was fine, bro. Told you not to call me-- I mean, fine. This chick was so fine, I spent all the bread I could get my hands on trying to get into her panties. Took her to coney island, the aquarium, the movies. Any place in Brooklyn I thought she might give it up, that's where I would take her, right? So after we had gone out a few times-- I don't know to this date how I knew, but I could tell she had finally decided to give me some, right? So, we had gone to the movies over on church Avenue, and when the flick was over, she asked me to walk her home, so I go like a bat. So, we start walking, talking, shooting the breeze, you know. And bing bing! My 20/20 start going off like crazy. It was like I could feel all the fellas around her way, they were checking me out, you know, like, "who's this chump? What's she doing with him," right? So, we finally get to her building, and it's all run-down and shit. I'm like, "what the fuck is a chick this fine doing living in a place like this?" Mierda, she was fine as wine. I'm telling you, dress her up in garbage bags, put fucking TV dinners on her head, you could not hide this kind of beauty, and after I'd taken her out all them times? Said I was going to get these panties. I mean, I was very serious about this pussy, ok? Is there a point to this story? Oh, yeah, check it out, I forgot. We had stopped to get some bacardi on the way, right? When we get to her apartment on the fourth floor, that shit was hooked up. Top to bottom, all exotic and whatnot. The bitch got beads hanging over the bedroom door, different colored light bulbs in the ceiling, and pillows on the floor-- that type of shit. Yeah, she lit up a joint, some incense, asked me to make some drinks while she goes and gets comfortable. [Speaks spanish] I made it. I made it to mill basin alive. I'm going to fuck the finest girl I ever seen in my life, right? So, I make the drinks. One for me, right? One for her. I'm sitting on the floor. I'm sipping my drink. I'm taking it all in, right? The lights, the reefer, the incense-- bling bing bing! My 20/20 goes off again, right? It's like I could feel something in the room. So, I go to put my drink down, right? The shit spills over. Fucking floor was slanted, bro. No lie, the shit was like this. So, now I'm trying to clean up my mess, and I hear this scratching sound on the floor behind me. I turn around. I see this rat. Go on, yo, a fucking rat this fucking big. Swear to God, it was as big as your fucking head. Ahh, I can't stand them shits. I'm telling you, man, that shit blew my mind. I mean, I couldn't concentrate on nothing else for the whole rest of the night. See, what happened was, when I was little, my sister Debbie, she got bit by a rat. She was only, what, 2 or 3 years old at the time. I didn't know it then, but I kept that shit locked up in the back of my mind. Like, in my subconscience, you know? So when the chick came out of the bathroom-- I mean, all ready to go, man, looking finer than a motherfucker-- pussy? Furthest thing from my mind. [Creaking] About time, yo. Here he comes. We got to get out of here, Mike. Shut up. I'm trying to think of something. While you're doing that, I'm bleeding like a stuck pig. I got to take a piss-- ow, ow, ow! You fuck! Tony: Yo, Mike. Yo, Mikey! Fuck. Yo, Mike. Ok. I'm going to go up on the roof. I'm coming with you. No way you're leaving me by myself. No. You move around too much, you'll only make yourself bleed more. Are you stupid? Don't call me stupid one more fucking time! Ok, I'm sorry, ok? Tony: Yo, Mike. Yo, Mike, you there? Where you at, baby? I don't know, Mike. I don't know this guy. How many times I got to tell you? He's a friend of mine. You keep saying that. Big deal. He ain't no fucking friend of mine. Ok. Ha ha ha! You playing, right? Ok. Keep it out, all right? Now, don't let him leave, and whatever you do, don't fucking shoot him. Ok? I'm going to go up on the roof. Mike. Mike. [Bang] Goddamn, this place is fucked up. Trick or treat, motherfucker. Yo! No problem, baby, all right? Shut up! Step in the middle of the floor, slick. Nice and easy. Right here ok, chief? That's fine. Just fine. Ok. Hey, hey, fucker! Use your head. Empty out your pockets on the table there and be very, very careful. Careful is my middle name, man. Just don't shoot a brother is all I'm saying. Just so long as the brother keeps his hands where I can see them. It's all I got, chief. I hate carrying this thing. Keeps the old lady off my case, you know what I'm saying? Hey, I ain't interested in your life story, pal. You sit down over there nice and easy, and keep your fucking hands up. You got it. Yo, my man. What the fuck do you want? Is Mike here? How the fuck should I know? Didn't I hear two people up here? Who gives a fuck what you heard? Look, I'm just trying to make sure I'm in the right place. That's all I'm saying. Now, he called my old lady, said he was trying to find his sister Debbie. I just want to see if I can help a brother out. Oh, great. Another one with the brother shit. So, you're a friend of his, huh? Look, man, that's my motherfucking man. Go back like car seats, baby. There's too much crime and too much time. See what I'm saying? Oh, Christ almighty. You all right, man? Yeah, I'm fine. I got to take a piss. Go ahead, man, take a break. I ain't gonna give you no-- you, just be quiet till Mike gets back. Oh, so he's here? Yeah, he's up at the roof. He said you was to wait for him till he comes down. Said to keep you here. Yo, my man. What? Can I put my hands down now? Yeah. Don't think I won't cap you one just because you're a friend of Mike's. No problem, man. Yo, what's your name? What? Are we fucking friends? What's your name, man? Torch. I'm Tony t. Nice to meet you. Whatever. I seen you somewhere before, right? Never. You sure I ain't never met you before? Hey, let me tell you something. I never seen you before. You never seen me before. I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I'd just as soon shoot you as look at you. You got it? I got it, man. No problem, all right? Put your fucking hands behind your head. Mikey? Mikey, man. I got to take a leak, man. You better get down here fast, or I'm going to fucking put one in your friend here. Hey, yo, take it easy, all right? You, shut the fuck up. Oh, shit. Ohh! Ohh...Ohh, shit! Shit, no. Mike: Oh, yeah, Billy. Motherfucker! Oh, shit! Fuck, man, whoa! Take it easy, torch. Give me the gun. Don't shoot, ok? What's the matter? You ok, bro? Don't fucking call me that. What's the matter?

There you go. 20/20 Mike. Tony t., what's up, huh? Ha ha! So, what happened, Mike? Fellas, can I get a hand over here? Hey, yo, chill. We'll get you cleaned up in a second, ok? Tony: What up, Mike?

What the fuck are waiting on? I'm dying over here. Damn, Mike. Where you find this evil motherfucker? It's a long story. Can you get us something to eat, and maybe something to drink, too? No problem. Yeah, some cigarettes and something sweet. And maybe some stuff to clean up his hand? You know, it's pretty fucked up. Yeah. No problem, man. What happened, man? What did y'all do? We tried to beat somebody and we ran into a little problem. Tried to beat somebody? Who? Yeah, well, you don't want to know. Manny Rivera, that's who. Torch: Ok? You can fucking go now. Wait a minute. Wait the fuck a minute here. You beat Manny Rivera? For how many keys? 3. Supposed to be 4. Torch: We lost one. What a fucking waste. You got a lot of nerve talking that shit after what you did. You going to start that fucking shit with me again? You're so fucking stupid. The next time you call me fucking stupid-- there won't be no next time, Manny Rivera find you two motherfuckers. [Sighs] I'm not feeling too good, Mike. You got to stop moving around so much. Look, Tony will be back in a minute, all right? Let me see your hand. I can't feel my fingers. I think I'm going to pass out. Jesus, man, you all fucking sweaty and shit. That's this fucking cold I'm trying to catch. I'll be fine as soon as we get out of here. All right, all right. Let me see that hand. No, just leave it alone. It will be fine. Come on. You keep it in your pocket, it's only going to get infected. Let me see. No. Ow! Let me see. No, man, stop. Let go of my fucking arm, for Christ's sakes, will you? Yeah, ok, go ahead. Keep in your pocket. Bleed to death, stupid. Hey, next fucking time you call me stupid, I'll throw you a beating you'll never forget. Oh, right. With one fucking hand, right? You know, that shit gets infected bad enough, you get gangrene. Cut the fucking thing off of you. The fuck they will. Besides, it ain't that bad. Oh, that's what you think? Well, then, hey. See if I give a marvelous fuck when it falls off. It ain't gonna fall off. It ain't that bad. I'm telling you. Just a scratch. Ok. Yo, house, where's Manny? I got to talk to him. Manny went to see his mother. You take care of your boy? I'm working on him. Buddha: Hmm. Ruffy, you owe me $100. Nah, nah. Give him a chance. He's a virgin. [Chuckles] What you going to do now? Buddha: I don't know what happened, but something's got to be a deal. We'll give you another couple of hours to take care of your business. Or your business becomes our business. Ahh-ahh! Make me some money, baby. Look, I didn't want to say nothing, but I think I seen him before. Who? Your friend there. Frosted flakes. Tony? Yeah. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You positive? I don't know. I can't remember where. How could you forget somebody like Tony? I don't know, but it will come to me. I'll tell you one fucking thing for sure, I don't like him. Yeah, well, you didn't like me when you met me either, Mr. Williams. Cut me a break with that Mr. Williams shit. Sorry, bro. Stop calling me bro. Jesus. I've known you two weeks. Already the biggest pain in the ass I've ever had in my whole fucking life. Well, that's only natural seeing as how me and you got the same fucking father. You and me is different, period. What you and me got in common, I don't want to talk about. What I want to know about is your friend there-- fucking Tony the frosted flake. Mike: Come on, man. Fucking Tony the tiger. Torch: What's the difference? We're talking about the same guy, right? So, what about him? How you know we can trust him? You see what I'm saying? How do you know he won't rat us out? No way! Look, man. Me and Tony did too much time together for that. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Positive? Absolutely. Absolutely positive. Ok. Ok. Hey, Mike. What? You think they'll really cut my hand off? Tony, voice-over: I was young, impressive, hot with my fancy. I was known as the adequate male. Oh, but how I cursed the day I made my play for that sidewalk jezebel. Manny: Precious. Hey, come here. She was a brown-skinned moll like a China doll walking the path of sin. Up and down she trod with a wink and a nod, and this bitch I had to win. What's up, Manny? No, it was not by chance I caught her glance because I meant to steal this thing, and when she looked at me, I jumped a league. Said it's time for old slim again. Freddie, did you miss us? [Freddie groaning] Boo hoo hoo. Trying to say something? What? Huh? What's the matter? You got problems with language? Come on, fellas. Give me a break, man. Why you got to treat a brother like this? A brother? What are you, a comedian now? You a funny man? No, man, I'm just trying to add a little levity to the situation, you know. Levity? Oh, that's a good idea. Here's levity. Seriously, fellas, life's too short. You shouldn't take everything so serious. Oh, philosophy now, huh? Make me laugh. He's right. Make--make Buddha laugh. You make him laugh, you get to live a little longer. Yeah. Ok. Yeah. All right. Show your best. Ok. All right, here's a good one. There's a--there's a white guy, a Chinese guy, and a black guy, all in the fifth grade. Who's got the biggest dick? I don't know. Who's got the biggest dick? The black guy, of course. He's 18. Ha ha ha! 18... You motherfuck-- ow! Looks like you lost a lot of blood, Billy. Yeah. You should have seen the other guy. Yeah. Very funny, very funny. Now don't move. All right, but it's fucking-- I told you it fucking hurts--ow! Hey. Quit moving, then. You know, we're lucky to be alive. Come on. Quit fucking moving, Billy. You keep fucking poking, and I told you it hurts me, for Christ's sakes. You know, I swear to God if I get any more of your blood on me, I'm gonna-- you think you're gonna fucking catch something? Don't worry, I've been tested more times than I can count. Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. Great. Makes us one happy fucking family. Ha ha ha! You fucking asshole. What are you talking about? Look at you, man. What? You're all fucking pissy and shit. I'm sorry. Look, we got to get you out of the jacket. Ok. All right? Yeah. Take it easy because it fucking hurts, all right? Don't fuck around. Ok. On 3-- let me help you. All right. Ready? 1, 2, 3, go. Aah! Fucking shit. Attaboy. Attaboy. Motherfucking son of a bitch. There you go, Billy. You did it, huh? You did it, all right? Fuck, yeah. Good. Good. Ok. Ok? All right. Hey, Mike, wait. What? What? You ain't gonna tell anybody I pissed my pants, are you? No, I'm not gonna tell anybody you pissed your pants. You swear? I swear to my mother. Ok? Ok. Come on, come on. Ok. All right. A guy's going to buy a brain, right? There's a white guy's brain, a Chinese guy's brain, and a black guy's brain. White guy's brain is $200, Chinese guy's brain is $300, the black guy's brain is $5,000. This guy goes, "hey, how come the black guy's brain is so expensive?" The guy goes, "it's never been used." Ha ha ha! Never been used, you dumb-- go ahead. Lay down. I like two pillows. Mmm. So what's up with you and him, huh? What's all this too much crime, too much time shit all about? Like I say, man, too much time, too much crime. I mean, it's funny we even ended up being friends. We were supposed to have this big fucking fight when we met. The two of youse was supposed to fight? I'd pay good money to see you get your ass kicked. Ain't that much kung foolishness in the world, all right? I'd have paid. Yeah. You and the guy that started it. Fucking garnett-- little guy with a big mouth, right? Said he was Tony's cousin, but he wasn't, right? See, what happened was, we was in the eighth grade. It was just before school was getting out for summer. I remember it was hot that day. Me and some of my boys were in the bathroom smoking cigarettes after lunch period. So, fucking garnett comes in with his boys. You know. He's wearing, like, a brand-new leather jacket, talking shit about how he robbed it off somebody, about how he did this, that, the other thing to the guy. Anyway, I said to garnett, I said, "what's the big fucking deal, man? It's only a fucking jacket, right?" The next thing I know, the punk jumps up in my face. You know, talking about he was gonna kick my ass if I didn't mind my business. So, I picked him up, I threw him headfirst right into the fucking toilet bowl. Motherfucker did not know whether to shit or go blind, but that ain't stopping him from running his mouth. No. Mm-mmm. He's all like, uh, "my cousin Tony's gonna make you sorry you ever messed with me," right? The next thing I know, everybody around my way, they're telling me about some big dude who's looking for me, he's into that fucking kung fu, karate-type shit. So now, I'm bugging the fuck out, right? I mean, I got my switchblade, I'm all up and down the Avenue looking for this guy. I'm standing across the street from Danny's candy store--ping ping. Ping ping. So I turn around, and I could see it was him. He says to me, "you're Mike?" I'm like, "yeah, you're Tony?" He's like, "yeah," so now I got my hand on the switchblade, and I'm hoping I get it out of my pocket, you know, before he commences to kung foo-ing my ass. Next thing I know, he says to me, "you want to go for a walk?" "Yeah." I'm telling you, bro, it was, it was like we were strangers to each other, but we wasn't. And we've been like this ever since, man. Went to erasmus hall together, drank, smoke, got high... Ate at each other's house all the time. You saw him, you saw me and vice versa, yo. My mom's practically adopted him, and my sister, Debbie, forget about it, man. She loved her some Tony. Senior year, we-- we got tired of doing school, you know-- dropped out, started doing crime instead. Got busted. They done put us on riker's island. I spent a whole 18 months locked up with this dude. I don't even know how I would have done my time without him, you know? He used to recite this-- this poem all the time. This crazy, jailhouse poetry-type shit, know what I'm saying? Tony: And under them neon lights, her eyes shone bright, and from them, a teardrop fell. When I asked her why, she began to cry and tell me this bitter tale, all about some guy that blacks her eye and takes all the bread she gets. When she lands in jail, he won't go for bail, and he defies her to call it quits. Well, I said, darling, dry them tears. Have no fear, because the tender, kind lover is here, and I'm staking a claim on all parts of your game. I'm vowing to have no peer. Well, she looked at me like a slave set free and said, "I'll be your woman." And when I left with her, her man did not stir. Yeah. I knew I had me one. That shit really got me through, bro. Helped me hang in there, you know, and do my time. Mike: And then when we got out, and he had Maxine pregnant with precious, he asked me to be the godfather. Me--nobody but me. Nah, man. Fuck that noise, man. Ain't no way that he would rat us out. That's my motherfucking man. Mike: Too much time, too much crime. You know what I'm saying? Mike: Torch, you ok? Billy. Come on. Wake up, bro. Yo, Mike. I got something sweet, man. ¶ And the itsy bitsy spider ¶ ¶ climbed up the spout again ¶ somebody's not singing here. Who's not singing here? Who's not singing here? Mommy. What's the matter, mommy? Sing with us. Yeah, mommy. What time does a Chinese guy go to the dentist? Look out now. 2:30. Ok. "Tooth hurty," you fucking--aah! Oh, no. It's tooth hurty. Aah. Come on, come on. Why do white people go to black people's garage sales? I don't know. Why? To get their stuff back. Ha ha ha! Why did the black guy hit the white guy? Because he wasn't funny. Pace yourself now, ruffy, come on. Don't give yourself a heart attack. Be in control of your emotions. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. No one's home. Just one more time, break it down for me, man. Make me understand. Ok? Ok. Like I say, we got to the stuyvesant hotel around 3:00, cased the joint, like me and you used to do back in the day when we flim-flammed all them wall street types. Tony: I hear you. Now, we were supposed to meet, like around 4:00. Around about 3:30, these 3 chulitos show up I never seen before, man-- real young cats. Really young--couldn't have been no more than what, 19, 20 years old at the most? Yeah. Had on them baggy clothes, fucking cornbred hair-- they were straight up stickup kids. Mike: They was babies, man. Tony, I mean, they were riding in an elevator with 4 kilos of heroin and looked like they was still on their mama's titty, ni me pregunte. So, we get to the eighth floor. I break left. They break right. I can feel them clocking me, right, but I never look back. No, no, no. I just keep walking like I'm going towards my room, and what happened? Ping ping. My 20/20 goes off, right? Tells me exactly what room they go to, right? Fucking guy got eyes in the back of his head, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ping ping. So check it: I just ease down the hall. I couldn't believe that Manny would send such young, dumb motherfuckers to deal with all this weight, but I figure, ok, it makes the job easier, right? I knock on the door. They let me in. They frisk me. They ask me who I got with me, that type of shit. I see they're getting a little nervous. So what do I do? Try to chill them out a little bit. You know, try to make a little light conversation. Chill them out, tell them how professional they are. You know, how Manny's a stand-up guy, he's always bringing up new talent, it's always a pleasure doing business with him and his people, blahsy, blahsy, blahsy, blip, blip, blip, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Carlito? Chill, papi. Mike: They seemed to chill out after that. So, torch knocks on the door. The kid lets him in because he thinks that we've got Manny's money. Money talks. Bullshit walks. Here endeth the lesson. That's why the shit went wrong, bro. You came in sweaty with your jaws all tight. You wasn't cool. Fucking guy was reaching for his piece. He never would have fired on us if you'd have just chilled. Get the fuck out of here. You don't know that. Yeah, I do. Let me tell you why. Because I done it. Me and Tony, man. We were in the same game with a lot of people, man. And you got busted, though, Mr. pro. Anyway... Yeah, anyway... So you started shooting. Then what? You should have seen it, man. Fucking bullets are flying-- [imitates gunplay] Fucking blood was everywhere. Man, I must have fucking shot these kids 5, 6 fucking times. Lit their asses up, man. Fucking the whole joint smelled like gunpowder. I didn't even know I was shot at first. It felt more like something burned me. Yeah, yeah. And then we lost one of the 4 kilos because you started shooting. Excuse me. Excuse me. I tried to pick up what was left. The shit was everywhere. It was mixed up with the shooter's blood and whatnot. Tasted like some very high-quality shit, though. Yeah. Thank you very fucking much. So you picked up the rest of the shit. You got the fuck out of dodge. Tony: So afterwards, where did you go? Went to Brooklyn. Brooklyn? Yeah. Let me tell you something. We could've got busted waiting for that fucking asshole. Who? Freddie: So what's up, fellas? Are we going to do this or what? He's all fucking worried over here. Are we going to move the shit? Don't worry about it. Yeah, yeah. I got this guy in sales says he can move the shit no problem. So where and when? The stuyvesant hotel-- get this-- on Halloween. Tony: What the fuck made you think you could trust that motherfucker, Mike? Come on, man. We used to get all our flimflam victims from him, right? Yeah, but didn't you never stop to think, Mike? It might have been him that set us up to get busted, man. Yeah, yeah, but... But nothing. The fucking guy has been working for Manny for years. Word? Word. Right over here in the fucking park. Yo. Remember when nine lives got shot in the head? Yeah, when Manny-- I remember that. That's how he got his name. Mm-hmm. Well, ever since then, Manny has been real superstitious about nine lives. I mean, he keeps that motherfucker around like a fucking rabbit's foot. They ain't even invented the type of shit that can kill nine lives. Where did you hear all this? What do you mean, where did I hear all this? I heard it around. What do you mean, you heard it around? Around, man. You know, around. No, I don't know. Around the corner? Around the block? Around the fucking world? What? Mike: Come on, torch, lighten up, all right? What the fuck is your problem, man? No problem, Mike. I just want to know where you heard about nine lives. You said he's out of the life, remember? So how the fuck does he know? Yeah. Where did you hear all this, Tony? Tony: Mike, I come to the city sometimes with my old lady, all right? Now, you know Maxine. She likes the restaurants, the shops over here, and whatnot. I run into people from back in the day. I hear things. Hears things. Fucking hears things. Hear that, Mr. Williams? Mike: What? Fucking rat is-- where? Right here, bro. Your friend-- Tony the frosted flake. What's the matter, Mike? Your fucking ping-ping ain't working? I told you I seen this guy before. All I got is the white girl, baby. If you're looking to score dope, you have to take your business elsewhere. See what I'm saying? Mike: You sure? Torch: Yeah, I'm sure. You positive? Absolutely, absolutely positive. Torch: Freddie, I got to get well. Ok. Freddie, what the fuck you doing? What? Manny find out you selling dope, he going to crucify your ass. Fuck Manny, all right? But you wasn't shopping with your old lady, was you, my man? You know who I was with, punk. Ohh, fuck! ¡Ay, Tony, coño! Not the balls, man! Oh, shit! Ow! Hey, hey, Tony. Be careful, man. What the fuck are you doing? You ok, Billy? Hey, what the fuck is wrong, fellas? He's wrong, Mike. They're wrong--him and nine lives. I seen them dealing in the park together. They's both working for Manny. Who's stupid now, motherfucker? Mike. Mike, I can explain. Please, Mike. Mike, you got to listen to me. Fucking listen to me, man! I'll fuck you up! Tony: Listen to me, Mike. Mike! Put the gun away, Mike. Put the fucking gun away! Ok, ok. I put it away. All right. Ok. Ok, now I'm kind of confused, Tony, because I don't remember you telling me nothing like that, right? Let me explain. I remember coming to Jersey when precious got baptized. You told me you was out of the life, right? You and Maxine, you opened up a laundromat or some shit, right? Ok. So what happened to that? I don't understand. You understand how I could be a little confused when you tell me you out of the life? Now you tell me you working for Manny, right? Mike, I'm sorry, all right? Tony, I love you. I love you like you was my own blood. Te amo como mi sangre, but if you're lying to me, I swear to God, I will fucking kill you. Fuck him. Let's waste him, take his car, get the fuck out of dodge while we can, man. [Cell phone ringing] Come on! Hold up. Hold up. What are you waiting for? Fucking waste him. Hold up a minute, all right? Go get the phone. Torch... Check the pay phone. Mike: You see anybody there? Bet your ass, Mr. Williams. Answer it. Yeah. [Busy signal] Yeah. No. No. Uh-uh. Not yet. Listen up, you motherfucker. Michael, it's Max. Max? Hey, hey, Maxine. How you doing, girl? You know, how come you always got to drag us into your bullshit, Mikey? We ain't even heard from you for 2 or 3 years. Yeah, I know, Max, but what can I do? Debbie's my sister, you know. I love her. I got to find her. All right. I don't want to hear about your fucking sister. Just put Tony on the phone. Come on, Maxine. Don't be like that. Just put Tony on the phone! Yeah, ok. Yeah, baby. I'm sorry, baby. Yeah, me, too. You all right? Maxine, are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. How's my little girl? She's sleeping. Manny is singing to her. You got to get us out of here, baby. You got to get us now. He's singing to my baby. You got to come and get us right now. Maxine, I'll do that on my way home, ok? I'm scared. I-I'm scared. I'll be there soon as I can. I just got to help Mike out, that's all. Maxine: Do it. Just do it, ok? Just do what you got to do, you hear me? Just do what you got to do. Yeah, I hear you. I love you. Love you, too, baby. Maxine sounds good, bro. Sounds the same. She's the same old Max. So what? His old lady called? That don't prove shit. Still don't mean he ain't working for Manny. I know, but we got to be cool, right? I'm through being cool. I say we fucking waste him now. You just got to calm down, ok? Yeah. Calm down, torch. You already got two murder beats hanging over your head. I ain't interested in being the third. The night is young, motherfucker. Where are you going, Tony? Where are you going? Ooh! How your balls feel there, fucko? Ok, maricón. Tell me something, t. Come on. Talk to me. Dime. All right. All right. All right. I started working for Manny after we got out of riker's. Me and nine lives were slinging jobs over in seward park. Now, I never liked being around him, but business is business. We only worked together for about a year. He could never stop running his mouth about how much money he was going to be making, how Manny was going to hook him up with a franchise of his own now. You know what I mean, Mike? I kept my mouth shut and went about my business, but Manny heard. Man, all the wolf tickets that nine lives was selling decided to cash in on him. One day, I look up, walks up to nine lives in seward park, shot him in the head. Then I come into thinking, man, about getting out of the life, you know? About getting my shit together. Max was pregnant with precious at the time, man. I wanted to be around to see my firstborn, so I went to Manny. I told him how I was feeling about my situation, and he was cool, man, so I took my little bit of chump change that I made from slinging them rocks, and I stepped the fuck off, moved to Jersey. I got my little storefront-- some washing machines, a couple of dryers, and that's when I went into business for myself. So I swear to you, Mike, on my little girl, man, I ain't had no further conversations with Manny or fucking Freddie nine lives or anybody else in the life except for you. The only reason I didn't tell you was I didn't want to let you down. Word is bond, man? My word is bond. Now she caught on kind of fast as the months rolled past. Are we game till the bitter end? A better ho I have yet to know, and they claim a dog is a man's best friend. She ran with the best, from the east to the west. I liked when her boosting hand came down. Many, many a chump got left in the dumps as we stole from them in all of them towns. Yeah, I laid, and I played off the bread this bitch made from the coast to old Broadway. My habits were small, and the money was tall. I really made this business pay. Torch: What a fucking fairy tale. Don't believe him. Don't believe him. He's only trying to save his ass. We're going to have to trust him. Why? Because I say so. Look. Fuck that. Give me the piece. You don't want to do him? I'll do him. How many fucking times I got to tell you "no"? We ain't going to do it your way. Why the fuck not? Look. If I was working for Manny, you'd be dead already. Ah, yeah. Maybe. Ain't no maybe about it because the longer you sit here, it's only a matter of time before he finds you. Come on. Think for a minute, man. Use your head. Maybe he's telling the truth. Yeah, maybe, but-- come on. I want you to trust me on this, all right? I've known this guy over half my life. If he says he quit Manny, I believe him. Ok. We let him live for now. I still don't like you, motherfucker. Check the pay phone. See if our friend is still there. Mike. Why heroin, man? Thought you'd stay away from that shit. Debbie being a dope fiend, and all. I told you before, Tony. My sister ain't got nothing to do with this. You understand me? Debbie's clean. She's clean. Oh, she's clean? I didn't know that, man. That's really beautiful. How's she doing anyway? Where she at? Arizona. They got some kind of rehab program out there. Yeah? What's it like in Arizona? How the fuck should I know? Thought maybe your sister might call you or write you or something. Jeez, it's a normal question. People have families, they try to stick close, that's all. Oh, so now you want to talk about family, right? Forget it! Yeah. Thought so. If it wasn't your idea, whose was it? Nine lives? No, it was mine. That fucking figures. Fuck is that supposed to mean? How's your cold, my man? Fuck you. Don't fuck with me. How's your cold, junkie? Hey, Tony, what the fuck you talking about? I'm talking about your boy there. Can't you see he's jonesing? Don't listen to this guy, Mike. He's full of shit. He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. He ain't no junkie, Tony. He's just got a cold. That's all. Wake the fuck up, bro. Boy's got the chills. His nose is running like a fucking v-8 engine. Got no tracks, motherfucker. See, Mike? No tracks. What about your feet? What about them? I peeked them after you had your little accident, stupid-ass junkie. Should have killed you when I had the chance, you motherfucker. Aah! Aah! Mother, sit your fucking ass down. Come on, man. Check his feet, Mike. If you don't believe me, check out his fucking feet. Get off me, man! Ow! I swear to God, Mike. No lie. Check out his fucking feet. Ow! Get the fu-- ow! Fuck! Ow! It ain't what it looks like, Mike. I swear to God, it ain't that bad. Man, I'm just chipping, that's all. Ow. Fuck! Let me up, man. Everybody in my family got to be hooked on dope. You related to this asshole? He's my brother, man. Half brother, you fucking prick. Shut the fuck up! Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow! What's the matter, junkie? You sick? Say "please," dope fiend. Say "please"! Leave him alone. Ow! Oh, Mike. That fucking hurt, Mike. Oh, man, you got to fucking help me, man. Ok. Ok. I got you. I got you, all right? We're brothers, right? Somos hermanos ¿verdad? We got to look after each other, right? Damn, Mike. I ain't even know you had a brother, let alone one who was... Well, you know it. I'm sorry, all right? Tony: I'm sorry, man. So you all never met before, right? You never knew anything about each other or nothing? Damn. Your pops was a player. Yeah. I'd like to kill him for what he did to me and my mother. He didn't break your mother's heart by knocking up some poor bitch from the projects. Hey, listen. You can talk about your father any way you want to, ok? But when you talk about my mother, you better show her some fucking respect. ¿Oiste? You heard what I said? Yeah, yeah. I heard you twice the first time. Let me tell you something about your old man, Mike. When I was in high school, I was a complete fucking ignoramus when it came to reading, writing, arithmetic, but I always got good grades in math. You know why? Because the old man was fucking my math teacher. Miss delvecchio. Never paid attention to what we were supposed to be learning, so she calls my parents to have a meeting about my grades. So the old man comes down to the school, off we go to the guidance counselor's office. So after about 5, 10 minutes of conversation about my grades, my attitude, my attention span, whatever, she goes to me and Mr. d., "would you gentlemen step outside so I can talk to Mr. Murphy in private?" So I'm sitting in class just after she came in. I remember thinking, "there's something different about her." She was always kind of an uptight broad, wore her hair pinned up in a bun. She comes back from talking to the old man. All of a sudden she's wearing it down around her shoulders. You know, like out of nowhere, she's all relaxed. She's got that well-fucked look, you know? She never said another word to me for the rest of the year, not a fucking word except, "thank you, Mr. Murphy," when I handed in my test, and that was the reason I suddenly became a mathematical genius. Broke my mother's heart. Because I knew about it, I could never look her in her eyes again. Now I ain't going to sit here and tell you that he didn't give you and your poor mother a hard way to go, but me and my mother put up with more of his bullshit on a day-to-day basis than you could ever imagine, Mike. So believe me when I tell you I know how you feel, bro. Believe me, man, I do. Damn. That's fucked up, yo. Tony: Now, you know how some bitches cry about the wind being high, cops being on their trail, about the snow and the sleet being asshole-deep and all the pimps can go to hell. Sitting in greasy spoons, jukebox saloons, killing a lot of time, sucking on beers, crying hard-luck tears while the pimps ain't got a dime. Both: Just sitting and bullshitting, sucking them party friends. Nodding so tough-- they're out messing with stuff-- that they miss all the righteous tricks. Why, you could lap their lid for the lowest bid, set that young ass on fire-- the cheapest young girl you could buy. Digging that cunt for a solid month while it's dope that's been doing all the pimping. But not this triple-a broad of mine. She was a sex machine that could walk between raindrops come typhoon, blizzard, or Gale. Standing on the hot brick, she'd turn a trick. Man, she'd trick with creeps and freaks, toenail creeps, breeds I can't even name, eskimo, negroes, Jews, apache, sioux. To her, it was all the same. Any way she would follow that righteous dollar to hell if she had to go. And be down there just waiting that trick with Satan. She was really a money-making ho. Why, for a lick or a lap of that mental trap, the tricks defied her due. Of course, her longest bread was made by head, and, Jim, how that bitch could chew. Now all my troubles began, and I quit snorting and commenced the hit. Now, you know how that go. I shot up more dope than any one bitch could get. I sold my shack, my Cadillac, the rug from up off my floor. I stole from ma and pa, and I shot up all that dough. My woman cried and damn near died when I ran up with her mink, but I stayed in my role, and I stole, and I sold everything but the kitchen sink. Down I fell to the depths of hell. I had put myself in a cross. My habits got tall, my money got small, but the deadliest blow of all came when this bitch took ill on short notice and could no longer gin. Her head was dead, her ass was red, the lips on her cunt was cold. I figured, what the hell, since the bitch ain't well, I'll get me a wife-in-law. Now there's this redhead bitch with a whorehouse itch over in Bernie Willis' stable. I call her big mabel, do my best while you convalesce, get back on your feet again. "Like hell," she cried. "I'll see you dead before I see you go. "May the black coach of sorrow pick your ass up tomorrow "if you walk beyond that door. "Now, I ruined my health and a bid for wealth "so that you could have your bed. "But you done went dopehead-- "shot up all of that bread. "Now, you talking that stable shit? "But you see, I'm wise to the lines "that you pimps drop on the frails "and the games you try to play, "and if this shit don't cease like motherfucker, "I'm calling the po-lice. Have them carry your ass away." Well, I just kept on fixing my shit because I was aiming to split. This is what I said. Mike: What did you say? "Bitch, you ain't no lady. "You know the game, but they call it cop and blow. "You done had your run, and now you're done. "I'm going to find me another ho. "Now, wouldn't I look silly with a broke-down filly on a track that was way too fast?" Mike: Mm-hmm. "Besides, a bitch ain't shit without a good man's wit, "and your thoroughbred days are past. "No, I'll put you in charge of my whorehouse at large, "give some girls the rule. "But you sound like hell "talking about putting me in jail, "you must be a goddamn fool, bitch. "Step aside. Let me slide. Hurry up. Get off my back." "I'm going to find me another young woman who can run the real fast track." Now I lean on my back in another ho's shack running down my pedigree. We heard a tremendous thunder that shook the door under, and I'm wondering who in the fuck that could be. Just then a policeman walked in with a great big grin fixed in a deadly expression. Wants to know, "your name rock?" "Pimping rock." "Hurry up. Sign this confession." "That's him," she cried, swinging her arms in the deepest of glee. "That's the dirty son of a bitch with the con man pitch that made a stinking ho out of me." Just then, a deadly blow knocked me to the floor, and I fell into a black repose. When I awoke, my jaw was broke. Blood was all over my clothes. And that's the tale that I tell from my prison cell, sitting here on my bed. Murder one, possession of a gun, and, yeah, I shot that stinking bitch dead. [Gunshots] Torch: I'm really sick, Mike. You got to help me. Mike, I'm really fucking sick, man. You got to just let me have a little taste. No way, man. No way I can let you have any of that shit. I just need a little bit, man. That's all. I just need a little bit. Sorry. You got to excuse me, bro, but I can't let you do that. All right? I'm going to be sick. Hey. Come on. Billy? Billy. You ok? Huh? You ok, bro? You all right? Oh, shit. [Coughing] Shh. Motherfucker, let me have a little bit, man. I just need a little bit. Come on, man. I need a little bit. Come on. I don't fix soon, I'm going to fucking die. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't say that. You ain't going to die. He's going to wish he was dead if he don't get straight. It still don't make no sense in putting that shit in his veins, Tony. He ain't going to get better no time soon without it. Torch, when's the last time you fixed? Yesterday. Come on, Mike. I'm fucking sick, man. Come on. Man, why I got to have a dopesick junkie for a brother? Huh? You don't want him to be sick? Let him fix. [Moaning] Ok. Ok. Go ahead. Comé mierda. Put that fucking poison in your body. Why the fuck should I care? Come on. Sit over here. Thanks, bro. Don't call me that. Sh-- I'm sorry, bro. Hey, don't call me that. Aah! Mike! You heard what I said? Don't you ever call me that as long as you live. Aah! Mike! First my sister. Now this fucking shit? Put your head out the window, man. You need to chill. You're only my half brother anyway. I don't even know why I thought that shit meant anything to me. Get the fuck out. Fuck. You got your works, baby? Yeah, in my jacket. All right. [Moans] Fuck. You guys got to help me, man. My hand don't work no more. I can't do this one by myself. Don't you even fucking look at me. I hope that shit kills you. Don't say that. I got it, baby. What you need? I just need you to hook it up for me. Ok. Like this? Yeah, that's good. Hey, Tony, man... Thanks. No problem. I'm sorry about throwing up on you. It's just when I get sick like this, I can't help myself. And you, too, Mike. I'm sorry about pissing my pants in front of your friend here, man. Hope I didn't embarrass you. It's just when I get sick, I can't help... Torch: Come on, man. Don't look at me like that. I hate it when people look at me like that. Don't fucking look at me like that. What you do that shit for anyway, man? I don't know. Because it's all I got. That's bullshit. No, it's not bullshit. It's not bullshit. You are bullshit, man. You're bullshit. Oh, no, I almost forgot, you're my long lost half brother, right? You tell me, what else have I got? I got no real family. Got no job. Ain't been able to keep one the past 5 years. Last job I had, I missed so many workdays from being sick, I said "fuck it." Started stealing full-time to support my habit. It's part of the reason I started hitting myself in the feet. This way, I don't got to walk around wearing long sleeves all the time. Sure, you know, it gets messy-- walking around, blood dripping out of your shoe. It's easy to hide. You want to know why, Mike? You really want to know why I shoot dope? Because I have to. The colds, they come. I don't, I get sick. You ever been sick? So fucking sick your whole body aches, your guts feel like it's on fire, your blood's boiling? There's not a fucking thing in the whole wide world you can do about it. It's not a good feeling, bro. Stop looking at me like that. 20/20 my ass. Yeah, you got eyes in the back of your head. You got any idea what it's like to want to quit and know that you can't? Like you really, really want to quit, but you just can't? Like in the past 5 years alone, I tried to kick 3 different times. Cold Turkey the first time. Next two times, tried a 10-day methadone program they got over in Brooklyn. I had 7 out of 10 days clean on my first go-around. Big fucking deal, right? Next time, two years later, on the 11th day, my girlfriend pattie came to pick me up. Off we went to cup. I had 11 days clean, $60 in my pocket. Bought 5 bags of dope, a pack of cigarettes. Shot them up just like... I remember the high I got from that shit like it was yesterday. Felt like superman. Invincible, you know? Here I come, man... Looking at you with those eyes. Only it wasn't your face I'd be looking at. It was my own. I'd be staring in the mirror, begging and crying for him to let me stop, but he wouldn't. Just kept staring back at me with this look on his face that's saying, "who's that crazy strung-out junkie "looking at me? "Can't be who I think it is. "I don't look like that, do I? "This guy looks dangerous. "Too dangerous to be on the street. Too dangerous to be me." But it is you. It's you exactly the way you are, sure as shit. What scares you the most is, that's what people see when they look at you the way you look at me. Whoa. Mike? I'm not feeling too good, man. Mike: Billy, stop fucking around, man. Billy? Billy? [Slapping Billy] Ok, um... Ok. I got to pick you up. All right? We're going to walk, Billy. Come on. Going to walk with me, bro? That's it, huh? Come on. What's the difference between the police and the po-lice? No idea. Well, obviously you've never been chased by them. Come on, Billy. Come on. Come on, Mike. Look at you. What you look like, man? Tony, you're supposed to be helping me, man. Oh, I'm supposed to be helping you? Ain't that a bitch? Don't move, Billy. You stay right there. I'm going to fix you up, ok? We're going to fix you up. Ok. Come on. Don't be dead. Come on. Don't be dead. Don't be dead, ok? Billy, Billy, don't be dead, ok? Come on. It's supposed to be my dope. Yeah. The dope you stole? Mine. But you said-- you said you was out of the life. Oh, come on, Mike. Once in the life, always in the life. You know the game. Hey, Tony. Look, uh, I need you to help me now. Ok? I want to, Mike. I really do. Besides killing you myself... I can't do nothing for you, baby. You going to kill me, man? I don't know, man. You don't know? You don't know? Come on, man. You just now said you was going to kill me. Me--godfather to your firstborn. You remember me? Too much crime, too much time like this, yo. Now you standing there telling me that all that shit don't count? Like it don't mean nothing? Like, what, all of a sudden I'm--I'm--I'm a fucking stranger? I don't mean shit to you no more? I can't believe that, man. I mean, I know a lot of shit can happen in 2 0r 3 years. You know, people change. But, Tony, yo, what the fuck happened to you? The fucking world happened to me, Mike. I got a criminal record, Mike. The world don't want no parts of me. It don't give a fuck about me. It don't owe me shit. Not a goddamn thing. So I did what I had to do, Mike. Now I don't owe nobody nothing. Yeah, nobody but Manny. You owe him. The motherfucker owns you. No, motherfucker. Oh? You own me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the dope, man. I didn't know it was yours, you know? Talk to Manny. Maybe-- Manny ain't interested in no conversations about nothing. Take a look out the window, Mike. Go ahead. Take a look out the window. This ain't no flimflam. This ain't no riker's fucking island. This is the life, Mike. What do you think they're going to do to me when I don't come through? What do you think they're going to do to Maxine, my little girl? They got Max? They got precious? I'm sorry, Tony, man. I didn't mean to put you in no shit. You are so fucking full of shit, Mike. I just thought that I could-- you thought? You thought what? That you could be Manny? That you could trust nine lives? You see, that's your problem right there, Mike. You don't think. You never fucking did. 20/20 Mike. You walk around like a fucking blind man, man. I ain't ready to die today, Tony. Brother, I ain't ready to die for you. Ok. Ok, I'll make a deal with you then. Fuck a deal. Come on, man. Look, I'm going to go downstairs like you said. I just-- ok, I'm going to go downstairs. I'm-- shut the fuck up, Mike. I ain't trying to hear you. I need you to stall them for me. I ain't trying to hear you, Mike. Listen to me. I'm going to go downstairs like you said, but I'm going to try-- fuck that, Mike. Get your fucking ass in here. I'm going to try and make it. I just-- I'm going to make it. I'm going to-- get that fucking hand down. Tony, I'm begging you. [Speaking spanish] I'm begging you, man. Please don't kill me, all right? Tony, I'm begging you. I'm begging you, please. Please don't kill me, Tony. Tony. Tony, don't kill me. No me mates, man. No me mates. Tony. Get up. Huh? Get the fuck up, Mike. I don't even know why I'm doing this, but... Because I'm your boy. Too much crime, too much time. Too much time. Mike... What the fuck am I going to say to Manny? Hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Come on, Tony. You'll think of something. You'll think of something, man. You're smart. Are we going to do this? Mm-hmm? We're going to do this right now, Mike. Ok. Ok. Do-or-die time, right? Right. Ok. Do-or-die time. In all these years I've known you, you ain't never laughed at my shit, and my shit is funny. According to you. That--that police, po-lice... That's funny shit. Then why didn't I laugh? You know, there's funny, and there's... You. Oh, man. Yo, Mike. [Speaks spanish] Take care of yourself, man. Hell, yeah. Listen, Tony, you give precious a big hug from Uncle Mikey, ok? Yeah. He was not funny. I'm funny. Are--are we being a little sensitive? No. Come on, now. Did he hurt your feelings, ruffy? You hurt my feelings. I'm funny. You got a-- please. That shit was funny, what I said. [Cell phone ringing] Come on, motherfucker. Answer the phone. [Cell phone ringing] All right. Mike: Oh, shit! Mike? Yeah? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm ok. What happened? I thought I saw a fucking rat, man. All aboard for the night train. Mike, it's do-or-die time, man. What are you going to do? I'm going to try to go out a back window on another floor. Hold up a minute, Mike. You almost forgot your piece, man. Tony. Thanks a lot, bro. Goddamn, man. [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Tony. Take that with you, baby. Knock knock. Oh, isn't that precious? First degree, baby. First degree. Tony on cell phone: Manny. Tony. You got it? Yeah. I got it. All of it? I said it's done. Very nice, Tony. Tony, voice-over: And that's the tale that I tell from my prison cell, sitting here on my bed. Murder one, possession of a gun, and, yeah, I shot that stinking bitch dead.
