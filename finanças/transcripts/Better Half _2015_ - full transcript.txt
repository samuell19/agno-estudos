(murmuring) - [Announcer] Please stand clear, the doors are closing. (pensive music) (bell ringing) - [Tony] Every time someone drops a dime on you it costs me a 20. - [Kalen] Nobody asked you to come down here. - I thought I was the one person who was supposed to give a damn. - It's not mine. - That's not gonna wash Kalen, do better. - It's not. - What happens if you get caught dealing dope again? What happens, Kalen? - I lose my juvie status. - And how many times is a probation officer gonna let you slide? - None. - That's right. Because the more kids he locks up the less work he has to do so tell me Kalen, am I wasting my time? - No. Alright man. - Alright what? - I won't carry no more. - And why not? - 'Cause the only person I have to impress is you. - And who else? - And myself. - It's your last pass Kalen. But you gotta step it up man. Just get through the spring and you're away to cop at State. You can do this. - It's just herb, you know? It's not like it's crack or nothin'. - Well, until herb is legal nationwide, do me a favor. Handle your business where even God'll have trouble finding you. (bell ringing) (light music) - [Leo] Sean. - Oh, sorry. What were you saying? - Hiring practices. How many minority hires did Larson Electronics have in the last year? - None. - How about promotions? - Three. They were Mexicans and a black guy. That's good, right? - It's something. Sean, we agreed that your family business has accumulated quite a few PR problems over the last few years and a bad business reputation can't be rebuilt overnight. We're gonna have to really work at this. - I understand. - I think that the public can be very forgiving but they can also sniff out insincerity so... - I am! We are sincere. And that's where your campaign comes in, right? It's really good Leo. - I just want you to know that we have a lot of work ahead of us. - Right, I know. - And your father, he's on board with all of this? - Yeah, of course. I mean he will be, I just wanted to get a handle on things first, I wanted to have all of his questions considered before I spring it on him. I wanted to get this head start and that's where your campaign comes in. It is really good, Leo. - Yeah Sean, it's a good start. (light music) (knocking) - Hey Nicky, you text me? (glass breaking) Can I come in mijo? What happened to your eye, Carla? - [Javier] She fell! - So you and Carla both fell off something today. (mumbles) - Don't look at me like it's my fault. Well this time it's not my fault! - It's okay. Hey Nicky, why don't you take your mom across the hall, visit the Guzmans, get some ice for her face. Go on, I wanna talk to your papi. - Hey. - It's okay. - Where are you going? Where to you think you're going? - It's okay, it's okay, I'll take care of everything. - [Javier] Where are you going, huh? - You don't look at them. - Where are they going? - You don't look at them, you look at me. - Ay, they listen to me. I'm the man, eh? - Feel like a man to beat up a woman, hmm? - Listen-- - What about you is like a man? - I had to slap some sense into my son. - Beat the shit out of you! - Stop, stop, stop, stop. (crying) Please stop. Just bring my family back, I want to see my boy. - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get you some coffee, we're gonna call your sponsor, and then we're gonna have a talk. Man to man. Again. (light music) - Ralph, your fourth quarter earnings are gonna be through the roof. - Chelsea, you know I can turn your annual giving around. - Making changes in your portfolio now could-- - Just take a look at them, that's all I'm asking. - Ralph, put her on the phone. - Shirley, I was happy to send them. - Charles Kessler has been providing sound financial advice to the DC business community for four years now. - Well maybe Brad will be ready to hear about some new strategies by the time those tulips blossom. - How did you hear about our firm? - Exactly. - Joe Burgess? Tell 'em about the new small business incentives. - Yep. - How is big Joey? - Well you want to get in before those new small business incentives expires. - Really? - Evan, it's Leo Kessler returning for Ms. Augustine Pierce. Thank you, yes, happy holidays. We're in the books for late March. - Yes! (slaps) March? It takes her three months to return then we have to wait another three just for a grip and grin? - Are you trying to tell me now that you don't think she's gonna be worth the wait? - Are you sick? Of course she is, but three months? It's just rude. - Don't worry, we're gonna get her. - We got this. (tense music) (breathing heavily) - Yeah, I'm on my way. - [Leo] We don't have to go. - Yes, we do. - We're gonna be late. - I am leaving right now. - Okay. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - [Tony] I'm gonna have to meet you there. - No way, no, I am not going without you. - [Tony] I'm gonna be late. - [Leo] Like I said. - Senorita. (speaking foreign language) I'm gonna have to call you back. - [Randy] When I hired you it was not for indentured servitude. - [Trav] Yeah, whose idea was that leash anyway? - It was his, but then Heidi thought it was a great idea. - Of course she did, that way she doesn't have to lift a finger with follow ups. - You do realize you're wasted in that job? You're young, you're smart, honey you could do so much better. - Where have I heard that before? - Don't you start. - He just wants to make sure that you turn that sad clinic into a hospital. Right or wrong? - You're almost there too. - 10 days and it's official. - Tony and Randy are doing good things for the whole world, unlike some of us. - Jealousy does not become you dear. - Oh please, what does a life strategist even do? I bet Randy doesn't even know. - What I do... (laughing) What I do varies exponentially depending on the client. It can't be summed up with something so vague like trying to save the world. - Come on, come on, lay off St. Tony. - Okay fine. Michael, have you asked that geologist out yet? - Come on, you guys know I don't date my students. (laughing) - What? He must be a graduate by now. - And he was never your student. - Okay I know I just can't take that kind of rejection right now. No seriously, let Prince Charming come chasing after me for a change. - Leo, I have an amazing idea. Why don't you set up one of your famous fundraisers? Find Mike a man. - I'm afraid my schedule doesn't really allow for any community service right now. (laughing) - Of course not because you and Tony already found each other. - And I thought he was gonna grow old dating his left hand. - Wow, dinner parties, always a classy affair. - Well it is true. - It is true. - It is true. - You guys do know how embarrassing this is for me, right? - Why do you think he does it? - So, how blue were Tony's balls when you finally got to them? - Actually more of a teal. - Do not encourage this. - Oh speaking of encouragement, that beautiful creature has finally given me his phone number. - Ooh, the guy from the Cheesecake Factory? - The one he's been stalking. - Yes. That is the one. I think he was just waiting for the right moment. - Yeah, to leave the country. - [Randy] Anyway he's really into me now. - I'd be into you too if you tipped me 50%. - [Randy] I had to get his attention somehow. - Yeah because making me call you Dr. Stervid totally wasn't working. - Look who's jealous. - I'm just looking out for your heart, darling. Besides, my gaydar tells me he's a republican. - I could be into log cabins. Open fires. Venison. Maybe some chianti. (laughing) (soft music) - You were quiet tonight. Something happen at work? - Mm mm, we agreed, no shop talk. - It's Christmas, you get a pass. Come on, spill. - Well. Javier's drinking is getting worse so it's only a matter of time before he goes after Nicky. - Tony, you can't help anyone who won't help themselves. - I know. - I mean if Carla won't leave the bastard-- - I know. Somebody left a baby today at St. Agnes. - What do you mean left a baby? - St. Agnes is a safe haven center. So women can surrender their infants, no questions asked. This girl, she gave birth on the street somewhere, in this cold. It's a premie Leo, I mean he's barely bigger than my hand. - Oh. You did have a shitty day. - Should have seen Shannon. She got his little heart going after it stopped. And she threaded this IV into the tiniest little umbilical cord I have ever seen. She's amazing. I named him Dylan. Even Shannon doesn't think he's gonna make it. - Tis the season for miracles. - Aren't you the closet optimist? - Tell no one. Come here. (phone ringing) Don't get it. Come here. No no no no no no. (phone ringing) - I'm sorry, I have to. - No, no Tony-- - I have to, I'm sorry. Ho ho ho, I come bearing some extra Christmas cheer for my favorite clinic staff. - [Stoney] How cheerful? - End of shift strength. - That's what I'm talking about. - Thank you for covering on such short notice. - Wild reindeers couldn't keep me away. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Hey, Feliz Navidad Tony. - Feeling better today Javi? - Oh, much better. Things got crazy, out of hand, but Carla is coming home with me now and I'm going to make it up to her, and Nicky too. - I don't think that's such a good idea. Carla might have a concussion, she-- - She's fine. Dr. Duvall already signed off on her. What are you doing here Parra? - Bruno backed out at the last minute. - Gracias Tony. - How can you let them leave with him? - They're his family. - Javier's the one who put her here in the first place. - No, you put her here, without sufficient authorization. - We cannot let Carla keep returning to the same dangerous situation. - She's afraid of her husband she can sign up for a spot in a shelter, right after she names him as her batterer. Until then, this is a hospital, not a hotel. - Merry fricking Christmas. - Okay, can we get this over with? - Yeah. (children babbling) - Can we go now? - Christmas is for kids, Leo. - So we can go now. - Yes, we can go now. - You don't want to double triple extra check on your precious Christmas baby? Oh I just reminded you of that baby, didn't I? - We're keeping him. He's our very first NICU patient. - Tony, you left so early this morning I didn't get a chance to ask-- - Tony. I'm so glad I caught you. - What's up Shannon? - Oh we were just about to leave, right? - I know you're technically on vacation. - No, he's actually on vacation so could you find someone else? - Leo, jeez, we're gonna spend the first 45 minutes today in traffic anyway. What's up? - Miss Jensen from earlier today. - Yes. (mumbles) - She, oh my god. I am so sorry. - What for? (gentle music) - I'm just, I'm gonna go. - Shannon, what are you doing? Shit. What are you doing? - Trying to get your attention. I was thinking instead of going to New York, why don't we keep driving and go to Vermont? Maybe go boarding, maybe get married? I know we could just go to city hall but I'm trying for the whole Prince Charming thing. Okay not the response I was expecting. - Are you sure? - I have decided to let you be sure enough for both of us. - No. Not this time. You have to want this as much as I do. That's the only way this is gonna work. That's the only way any marriage works. So do you? It's okay, I can wait. - It's yours either way. You still wanna go to Vermont? - We can practice being newlyweds. - Bring the suit. So where's the back door to this place? (heart beating) - [Tony] Tis the season for miracles. - Come on. - [Nelson] I'm beginning to think you only wanted me for my uniform. - Not just the uniform, you're a great role model. You're a cop, you're a dad. How are the kids anyway? - Debbie won't let 'em call me. - Such bullshit. You're their father, you have rights. What does the lawyer say? - I had more rights before they moved to Chicago. - What you could do is a-- - Tony, don't help. - So you're over looking at houses? - Man, you were just all ambitious after you got that boy to propose to you. - It's the American dream, isn't it? The house, 2.3 kids... - And a German shepherd? You know he's not a family man. - He will be. (speaking foreign language) Javi. (speaking foreign language) Slow down. (knocking) DC PD, open up. - Javi it's Tony bro. - [Javier] Get the hell out of here. - [Carla] Javier, I said no. - Leave Mom alone. (slaps) - Hey! (speaking foreign language) - That's enough! (speaking foreign language) (coughing) You're under arrest for child endangerment, aggravated assault, and anything else I can think of on the way to the station. - Hey. - You okay? - It's not my fault. - Can you open your eyes? Good. - It's not my fault! Tony, tell them it's not my fault! (shouting) - You'll be fine. - Ms. Pierce, your family enjoys such an enviable position at this edge of the District's charitable donation scene. I'd like to assist in continuing that Pierce legacy of generosity towards the underrepresented and disenfranchised members of our community. - My mother didn't give much thought as to whom she gave our money to before she signed the checks. Downtrodden or otherwise. That is a family legacy I will not continue. - Well of course, I think we all want to be sure that our donations are going to where they'll do the most good. Thank you. - So. What else? - I'm sorry? - You've just recited my mother's eulogy verbatim. What else do you know? - Well your family originally comes from West Virginia. You've been married twice and you're currently going through your second divorce. Your future ex-husband is suing for custody of your 15 year old daughter from your first marriage and perhaps we shouldn't be discussing this. - On the contrary I think this is your perfect time. Have you ever been involved with a married woman, Mr. Kessler? - No ma'am. - Any illegitimate children out there? Recreational drug habits? - Of course not. - Uncomfortable? - I wouldn't say uncomfortable-- - I'm surprised because these are intrusive questions. - And I apologize for being indelicate. - When something is common knowledge, the public, the press, they all think it's just perfectly okay to be indelicate. I'm tired of finding out about people after the fact, Mr. Kessler. I need to know who I'm dealing with, really know them. - I understand completely. - Good. Then you'll understand that it's going to take more than a cup of camomile to get me to hand over my checkbook. - Hey Becky, I have Nicolas Melendez's forms. You seen Heidi? I need her to approve some of these. - Just missed her. She's on vacation. Two weeks. Thank you Jesus. - Vacation, that's right. Guess that means I'm in charge. - That's not all she left you. - What are you talking about? - She really left without telling you? - Telling me what? Careful. Break your hand like that. (laughs) No wait, come on, let me show you. Alright. Wanna keep your fist tight and your wrist straight. Because that way you can hit it with more force. Keep that wrist straight, turn it over a little bit. Yeah. (laughs) Hey, that was pretty good. This time why don't you put your hip into it a little bit? Twist from the hip. (laughing) There you go. It's getting better. Next time we'll tape up your wrists. Do it right. - Thanks coach. - It's so early, do you want to go for a run? - Yeah. (light music) - [Tony] So any luck chipping away at the old ice queen? - [Leo] I blew it. - [Tony] Not likely. - Managing her estate would be a lot of work and a lot of money. Pierce would be the only client Maya and I ever needed. - Well, then go get her. So is now a good time to talk to you about an itty bitty job fair slash film festival I want to put together for the kids in the youth program? - Why not? We're in your office as it is. - Meaning? - [Mr. Robinson] Counselor. - Case in point. - How's my boy? - He's doing just fine Mr. Robinson. - You keeping him off that crack rock? - Yes sir, you'd be very proud. - Just so long as he stay off that crack. Crack kills. Crack killed me. - It hasn't killed you yet. I can get you in a program, all you gotta do is say the word. - Look after my boy, you hear? Black boys don't got nobody. - Sure smells like something killed him. - Leo, come on. - Just once I'd like to go on a job uninterrupted without one of your-- - They're people. They're poor and they're troubled but they're still people. I don't stop caring the second I get off the clock. - No one's asking you to stop caring, just try to care less. So what kind of a job fair slash film festival did you have in mind? - [Tony] Hey Nelson, I was gonna call you. - Was it about this? You left this in the squad car today. - I would have come to you. - It's alright, I know how you are about your binder. You remember what happened last time. - 'Cause I was nervous that people shot that guy. - I was just doing my job. Hey, nice job today. - You did all the work. - Me and my uniform, right? He didn't tell you? We locked up Javier Melendez today. - That's great, why didn't you tell me? - I will feel better once he's sentenced. - You wanna come in and have a drink or something? - No thanks, I'm good. Nice work today counselor. - What? (moaning) Your mood has definitely improved. (chuckling) - Uh huh. And your latest obsession has finally resolved itself. No more Melendez clan. - I'll still feel better once he's sentenced. - What do you think, no crisis for a whole month maybe? - I wish. They brought him back. - Who brought who back? - The Bauers. Brought Dylan back. - Dylan the Christmas baby. Why? - I dunno. They freaked out when they couldn't get him to stop crying and then when Heidi told them that Dylan was a crack baby they bailed. Leo, we have to take him. - You promised me that you would not get attached to that kid. - I know. - For months you stood vigil over it until it could breathe and eat and piss on its own. - We never had a baby this sick at St. Agnes. - You spent weeks obsessing over finding just the right parents and you promised me you were done with it. - I never thought that they would bring him back. Doesn't that tell you something? - Yep, that he's a bad penny. Aren't there tests or something that can prove Heidi's full of shit? - Nothing conclusive. (toilet flushing) Leo, we talked about fostering kids before. - A kid Tony, not an infant. You said so yourself. You said older kids have a harder time finding homes. - But we could know what it's like to be parents from the very beginning. (soft music) The first words, the first steps. We could have all that. He is so beautiful, Leo. Looks just like you. - Wow, you almost got me. Besides, who would take care of it? - I will. - [Leo] How? - I'll quit. - There is no way you would quit. - I will. No more homeless, no more junkies, no more burner phones. I mean it. - Ask me tomorrow. - He's our baby, Leo. And come on, how often does a chance like this come along? - You want me to be sure about this, don't you Tony? - I am sure enough for the both of us. - No, what happened to if this is ever gonna work we both have to be sure? - You can not be as sure as me and we both know why. You're not your dad, Leo. - Oh Tony. - You're nothing like him! - How would you even... Do you mind if I have like a minute to get used to the idea? - I'm sorry. - Just ask me about it tomorrow. - You could be in a shitty mood tomorrow. - No I won't. - You're always in a shitty mood after you visit my mother. - Ask me the day after tomorrow. (light music) - How are those ribs? (murmuring) - So are you two hitched yet? - Uh not yet Ross. - What are you two waiting for? I thought you'd be all over that. - Rolls, anyone? - I will have one, thanks Mom. - I'm just saying, isn't it a little surprising? I mean it's legal. - Actually. Leo and I are thinking of adopting a baby. - [Ross] Shit. (laughing) - His name is Dylan and he was born premature on Christmas Eve Eve. - Is it one of those black crack babies from the shelter? - Do you actually practice ways to embarrass me or is that something you just get from your father? - Meg, easy. He's just a teenager. - He's not a crack baby. He's just an orphan in need of a home. Statistically speaking there's over 140,000 kids in the American foster care system. If every able-bodied adult-- - Anthony, I think we've heard enough about your ill-advised lifestyle choices for one meal. - You know what Sylvia, if I could just be here for one dinner where you weren't-- - Oh you want pepper? Here you go. You know your precious Pistons are gonna get creamed today, right? - That injury list? Where have you been all season? - Sorry. (laughing) - What? - I told you you were gonna get creamed! - How could they count that? That was obviously a foul. - You're going down, it doesn't matter! Done. That game over. - What happened to your injury list, what's going on? - Hey Tony, please. - Sorry. - Thank you. - [Tony] Happy Easter, Detroit. - [Ross] You suck Uncle Tony. (laughing) - I'm glad you're with my son. Don't look so surprised. I am his mother, I do care about his happiness and you seem to make him happy. - I try. - Anthony's always extended himself to strangers who never give him a second look once they've got what they want from him. - He takes care of people, he can't help himself. - As infatuated as he was with that police officer, I think you might be better for him. - Well thank you Mrs. Parra, that means a lot to me. - At least I know you will put a stop to this baby nonsense. - [William] Is it a boy or a girl? - What's that pop? - The baby you want. Is it a boy or a girl? - It's a boy. His name is Dylan. I named him. - Like the marshal or the folk singer? - Like the poet, Dylan Thomas. - Ah, that's nice. - No we're actually looking at houses just a few miles up the street from here so we could bring him over all the time. - You know you were a premature baby. - Really? You never told me that. - Your mom thought she was going through the change. (laughing) We didn't even know she was pregnant until you were five months done. Then you were three weeks early. Since the day you were born you've been full of surprises. Good luck, son. - Thanks pop. - [Leo] Excuse me? - Well I know you will never allow this child to happen. And you shouldn't. - And why is that? - I have always known that you cannot tolerate children. - Well no, Tony's constantly talking about kids. - Yes but you aren't. You like things exactly the way they are, don't you? A parent has to be selfless, and that is a quality that my son possesses in excess that you lack entirely. I'm confident you will get Tony to see things your way. Thank you so much for helping clean up. - Yeah, it was a pleasure as always. Tony. We're leaving. - Oh shit. Later pop. (laughing) See you later Russell. - Later bro. - Your mom's a real piece of work, you know that? - I knew it. What'd she do this time? - Screw trying to bond with that woman. I'm never doing dishes with her again. - Fine, no more dishes. What happened? - No. No, nope, no families. I'm still not talking about your mother. So how would this work, if we wanted to keep the kid? - You would petition to adopt Dylan from the state. - Why just me? - You make more money than I do, you're a stronger candidate than I am. - What about you? I mean you were an EMT for two years, you're practically a doctor. (laughing) - That is very sweet of you but I am nowhere close to being a doctor. Besides I meant on paper, that's what matters. We can file the paperwork while Heidi's on vacation. But it has to be perfect the first time around so I think we should keep it simple. One baby, one dad. And I know St. Agnes could use a cradle so we could get physical custody of Dylan right away. The actual adoption could take up to a year but after you have custody of Dylan, then I can petition for a second parent adoption. - And then we get to say things like because I said so and go ask your father. - That could get confusing. Are you sure? - No. But you are. And that's good enough for me. Besides you'll be doing all the work anyways so-- - Well I will take care of everything. Thank you. (upbeat music) How are you doing over here? - Good. Yep. Babe. Babe. Babe. Okay. ♪ All the time ♪ Let's take an afternoon drive ♪ See I been working too hard and I want to leave it ♪ All behind ♪ Behind me (laughing) - He looks just like you. - Told you. ♪ Try to make it on easy street (baby crying) ♪ It's as every sense as got me in logical ecstasy ♪ Oh it's good (laughing) I told you to be careful!

(laughs) - I love you. - You better. Why do you think I'm doing all this? Everyone have a seat. - [Randy] I love having dinner here. - So what is everybody thankful for? - I am thankful that Mike is not hosting for another three months. (laughing) - Hear hear. - Cheers. - Rude! (baby crying) - Sorry, excuse me. Gotta take care of this. - When's your shift? - What do you mean? - Obviously you guys take turns, right? - Turns at what? - With Dylan? - I work. - You know, taking care of kids is work too. - This is how he wants it. Excuse me for just a minute. - You know something tells me that kid is gonna be-- - [Leo] When are you coming back? - [Tony] Uh, as soon as he calms down. - [Leo] Just let him cry. - [Tony] What? - [Leo] You're not supposed to pick up a baby every time he cries. - [Tony] Okay it's not that kind of crying. - [Leo] How do you know? - [Tony] I just do. - [Leo] Well what am I supposed to do with those people out there? - [Tony] Uh they're not a lynch mob, they're our friends. - [Leo] Your friends. - [Tony] Would you rather swap? I'll entertain and you can take Dylan. Okay wait hold on. - I give him one week before he breaks. - I dunno, he's lasted this long. - Just saying. There's only room for one diva in this house. - You're all forgetting one thing. Whatever Tony wants-- - [All] Tony gets. - True that. Tony'll take care of everything. - How's everything? Can I top anyone off? - It's too easy. (alarm playing) (baby crying) (soft music) - You mind telling me how we three guys are gonna get clean like that? - It's about calm. He loves this. - How can you tell? - You just can. Just come over here, hop into the shower for a second. - No thanks, just had a shower. But I will take your word for it. (humming) (crying) - [Dana] So the lungs are all clear and there's no scar tissue. - Hey, no scar tissue, that's good news. - Great. - He's still so small. - Don't worry, give it some time. He'll hit a growth spurt. Just be patient. - What about all the crying? - Infants can take up to a year before they sleep through the night. Right? And premature babies, they have all sorts of challenges. So just give it a month, keep a journal, and let's talk then, right? Don't worry dads, you're doing good. - How's Tuesday look? - That should work. - Mm hmm. Tuesday. (phone vibrating) - You know that's my phone, can you take him? - Sure. Hi. - You know what that's Randy. I'll meet you back here? - Sure. - Look who's here, it's our miracle baby. - Do you want to hold him? Here you go. - Oh you're just as cute as ever. Big beautiful boy, oh. (baby cries) Daddy I think somebody needs a change. - [Leo] Oh. (laughs) (sighs) (knocking) - Hey counselor, come in. Heidi and I need to talk to you for a minute. (baby crying) (apprehensive music) - It's okay. Shh, okay, you're okay. - [Heidi] I've warned Dr. Stirdivan about endorsing such a reckless enterprise as this adoption. - How is giving Dylan a home reckless? - It's borderline fraud. There are rules against staff becoming personally involved-- - I'm not adopting Dylan, Leo is. - Are you saying you won't be filing for guardianship as well? - Well I won't be working for the District by then now will I? - Oh. - Every at risk child deserves the best possible chance at a secure future. That means a home with married parents. - You were saying? - A child needs a mother and a father. - Oh like the Bauers. - [Heidi] It's in the child's best interest! - It's in the child's best interest to have two parents who love him unconditionally. - You can't go through with this! - I'm sorry Heidi. Today Tony's made the better argument. - Sorry to drag you into this. - You didn't, I did. It's the letter Dana Reid and I are sending to Judge Joiner for recommending that Dylan's adoption be expedited. Since he is a child of questionable health, we both feel that he needs a permanent guardian to make medical decisions for him sooner rather than later. - Thank you. - It's just a letter of recommendation, it may not count for anything. In the meantime. His name is Jesse Ehrlich. Train him well. - Hey. I'm going to Virginia. - Have fun. - Thanks. - Wait. Mmm damn you look good. - Thank you. - Where are you going? - Richmond. - Oh Augustine the ice queen? - Yep. If everything goes well I'll be back tomorrow and if not-- - Alright we'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you. - So what do you think big D, you wanna give me like five more minutes of sleep? (baby gurgling) Okay, alright. And we're up. Oh yeah, we're up. Oh I know I wanna be asleep still too. - I thought we'd just vet the cases that come through St. Agnes. Don't we pass these off to caseworkers down at central? - That's the way Heidi sees it but I say we are caseworkers. So you either pass it on down to the drones downtown or be the one to take it across the finish line. - Did you really get in the middle of a gang war over a kid? - Where did you hear that? - Heidi said you got stabbed trying to face down some kingpin in Prince Georges County. - He wasn't a kingpin. - So it's true? - He was just some drug thug that was making the kids at his block deal drugs for him. - Why would you stick your neck out for-- - Kevin Seward had a shot at a bright future but only if he got out of that neighborhood without a criminal record. If you're gonna quarterback your own cases, you gotta know when you're in over your head. I didn't and it cost me a kidney. (soft music) It's why Heidi thinks I'm overzealous and it's why Leo worries all the time. But that's what this job is Jesse, it's runny noses and juvies and battered wives. But these people gotta know we're gonna stand up for them. - Red files? - Officially there are no red files. - There aren't? - But if there were, they would be former clients still in at-risk situations. - A pile full of Kevins? - You got it. (phone ringing) - Is that coincidence or some kind of test you set up for me? - It is definitely not a test. Jesse, how are you with kids? (light music) - [Carla] Tony? - Hey mijo. Why the tragic looks? - [Nicky] Papi found us. - No, papi's behind bars. To get out he has to see a judge and I have to be there for that. - No, he's out, he has a thing on his leg. - What you've seen him? Carla please tell me you didn't. - He said he was sorry. - Carla, the location of the shelter is supposed to be secret to protect everyone that lives there, not just you. - I'm sorry. - Sorry is not good enough, Carla. - Please don't be mad at us. - I'm not mad, Nicky. It's just I need your mom to understand that I can't keep fixing this. - I called my mom, I told her. You know, how he is. She said that we can go home, she said that I can bring Nicky, right? - Where's home? - Hey, hey man, how's it going? You must be Leo. - And you are? - I'm Jesse. I'm watching Dylan for Tony. Hey does he have like a favorite toy or something? - Excuse me, who are you again? - I'm Jesse. I'm the new Tony for St. Agnes. The Batphone rang so he bolted. - Aren't you supposed to be taking those calls now? - Hey, that's what I said. Hey man, maybe you could hold him? - No, no looks like you're doing just fine. - Seriously dude, I needed to pick up my kid sister like 20 minutes ago. Thanks. (gentle music) (baby crying) - What the fuck Tony? - It'll be one minute Greg. What happened? - Where have you been? - I got a call. How long has he been screaming like this? - [Leo] Why didn't you just send Jesse? - He's not ready. - [Leo] Where were you? - [Tony] Just told you. - Take Nelson with you? - Come on baby boy. - Did you? - I am not having this conversation. - Then tell me which client it was. - You want to know specifically? - Yes! - Well it's none of your fucking business. Bring it down a notch. Shit. (tense music) - [Leo] Is he asleep? - He has an ear infection. I'm taking him to see Dana tomorrow. - I didn't know. - Well if he's ever screaming like that again just don't even think about it. Just take him to the ER. - All that screaming sounds the same to me. - Well then you're not listening. - I bought Thai, come eat something. - You know, you're a real shit sometimes, you know that? Is that really what you think about me, that I would go off and cheat on you? How fucking pedestrian can you get? - I never said you were cheating. - Then what? Do I need a hall pass, a goddamn witness every time I leave the apartment, is that really how it's gonna be now? - We had a deal. No more running off to save the day. - Someone was in trouble. - I was in trouble! He's screaming his head off for the entire apartment building to hear and some punk kid is-- - Are you trying to tell me that you got pissed off because you got embarrassed? - I felt like an idiot. - Grow up Leo. If you took half the time you spent worrying about what other people think about you and focused on what was wrong with our kid maybe you'd start getting better at this. - As far as I'm concerned there's always something wrong with that kid. - I can't be here every second of the day. - That was the deal. - You said you wanted this too. - I said maybe. I've always said maybe. But leave it to you to pounce the one time I let a yes slip out! - You are a fucking asshole! - It's true. It's why you were with Nelson and it's why you're with me. Because kids are the one thing you can't get by yourself. (baby crying) I'll get him. - Don't bother. And just for the record the only thing I can't get by myself is a family. (music box tinkling) I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - What happened in Virginia? - Complete misfire. She caught a different plane to Paris so no layover, no meeting. Maya was not happy. Who was in trouble? - I don't wanna talk about it. - It was stupid of me to bring up Nelson. - Really stupid. - Well we both know how good I am at jumping to the worst case scenario. - Can't just dump my files on Jesse and walk away. He deserves a bigger picture than what Heidi's gonna give him. My kids, my clients, they deserve someone who sees them as more than notes in a folder. - Tell that to our kid. What? - You said our kid. - Correction. My kid. - I'm gonna keep my promise. - I know. - It's just... It's gonna take a little bit of time. - I know. - Hey. Then what? What is it? - You know the messed up gene pool I come from. I'm the last person who should be raising a kid.

You've had the rings for months now, ceremony's just a formality. Babies are tricky. They take getting used to. Nevermind they scream their heads off like you're holding them upside down or something. I think they can smell fear, like bees. Seriously. - You should see him with this kid, Maya.

He's tougher than the both of us. Okay up and down is bad. Side to side is good. - Counselor, you keeping my boy off that crack rock? - Hello hi yes actually yes sir, we both are. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Jesse, I'm the new counselor. - What's wrong with this one? - Tony is stepping down. - This your boy? - Yes sir. - He look like you. You looking after my boy? Black boys don't got nobodys. - Mr. Robinson, right? Um, I'm gonna go get an iced tea. - Well go ahead then. - Why don't you let me buy you one and tell me more about your son? What's his name? - Kalen Robinson. - Kalen, right. He's the smart one. - I love that kid. He tries so hard. - Gotta make it happen. - Hey man, you do what you gotta do. - You know, I'd better get going. - Alright you just got here. - I will check on those tents for you. - You gonna say bye to your baby? What? - Bye baby. - Officer Nelson, hey. How's it going? - It's good, it's good. Carter. - Oh, hi, how you doing? So Tony told me you took a bullet for him? - Man, I wish he'd stop saying that. - Why? You're a hero. - It was during paintball. - Oh. (laughs) - You know he's the one with the real war stories. - Yes, hi. (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) - Did he tell you about the time he got stabbed? - [Jesse] Yeah, yeah. - Been drinking Javi? - Tell me where they are. - I can't do that Javi. Hey. - The drug dealer guy. - It was this kid right? - Yeah. - Hey don't put your hands on me, huh? - Stop it Javi. - You don't do that. - Okay I am done. - I'll get mad. You hear me? - No do you hear me? I am done trying to help you if you won't help yourself? - You tell me where-- - Carter! Carter, Carter, 1035! - Will you listen to me? - Tell me where they are. - I can't do that Javi. (crying out) - No! - Fuck you. (gun fires) - Ron I need those tents like a half hour ago. Tony's got people waiting. They're there? Okay great, thank you, thank you, thanks a lot. Tony? - You're not answering your phone! - Yeah my battery just died. - Listen to me, we have to get... - He's been shot, twice. I got one out, the second I can't get to it. - Why did they bring him here, why not a real hospital? - This is a real hospital, we handle gunshot wounds all the time but look, it's complicated. - Did someone call his family? - I got it. - Randy called in a thoracic surgeon from the university, she'll be here any minute. Just keep him calm a little while longer. - The baby? - He's fine. Not a scratch. (beeping) - I can't leave you alone for a second can I? They want you to save your strength until the surgeon gets here, okay? - Dylan, where's Dylan? - He's fine. He's fine. He's tougher than both of us, remember? And you're still doing all the work. That was the deal. (clattering) It's okay, okay, Tony, you with me? It's okay, it's okay, look at me, it's okay. Just you and me, okay? It's just you and me. Just you and me. - I love you. I love you. - You better. No one else does. (groans) - We're gonna give you something to relax. We need to intubate. Just one more minute. - Tony she's-- - I'm not ready. I'm not ready. - Tony she's here, she's here. Randy brought the calvary, it's gonna be okay. Okay, stay with me, Tony. Tony? - [Nurse] Leo, Leo move, move! I need some help in here! (beeping) (melancholy music) - [Becky] Dr. Stirdivan. What about the intake line? - Leo I'm so sorry. - [Becky] What about the people already here? Dr. Stirdivan? - Becky, right? Who's next? - Where's my boy? Is he alright? (baby crying) - Maya. Here. - [Reporter] Were you aware your lover had violent enemies? - [Reporter] How long were you and your lover together? - [Reporter] Is this a hate crime? - [Reporter] Which one of you is the biologicl father? - Was he injured in any way? - [Reporter] Are you surprised this happened? - [Reporter] Is your partner still alive? - Were you surprised? - Get out of the way, The next person who pushes one of these people is gonna go to jail for child endangerment, now get the hell out of the way. (shouting) Leo listen to me. Now Fergus is right out front, he'll get you home. Just keep the flashing lights in front of you, you got it? - Do you want me to drive? - I can drive. - Okay I'll be right behind you. - You go on and get Dylan home, I'll run interference here. (baby crying) - [Reporter] We have continued coverage on a shooting at Southerly Park which has left two people dead. - [Reporter] Sources say the young father, 30 year old Anthony Parra was in the park with his infant son when a gunman brutally fired two shots. Police officers on the scene subsequently killed the suspect to protect the infant who lay in the stroller directly in the line of fire. - [Reporter] Known for keeping the peace and instilling hope in those who had none for the disenfranchised youth of Wilmington District, Tony Parra was hope incarnate. - Tony didn't believe in lost causes. He never gave up on anybody. - Tony helped at risk families. Kids who didn't have any folks or anyone to talk to. He didn't care who you were, he helped whoever needed it. - He was the first one to step to me with a handshake instead of handcuffs. What are we supposed to do now? - Sources have confirmed that the suspect gunned down the social worker after being given an early release from the county lockup where he was awaiting trial of charges of spousal and child abuse. - [Reporter] The gunman confronted the homosexual while he was strolling with his infant foster child. As of this broadcast, police have not established a motive for the shooting. (baby crying) (Nelson crying) - Kids hate me. - Me too. Here, let me try. - St. Agnes Medical Center is deeply saddened by the death of Anthony Parra. Now that we've lost Tony all appropriate measures will be taken and the foster child will be returned to the safe custody of child and family services. - Son of a bitch. I gotta go. - [Trav] Where are you going? - Damage control. (mumbles) - Scare us in our line of work? He really cares. Cared. (baby crying) (Leo crying) - Leo? - Leo Kessler, I'm holding for Shirley Brown. Thank you. Yes I'm still holding for Shirley Brown. Look I understand it's a postponement not a cancellation but you have to give me some sort of. Has Mr. Casten found other representation now? Yes, yes, I'm still holding for Shirley Brown. Then I'd like to leave another message. Charles Kessler is not a gay business. For one Maya Charles is as straight as they come and secondly the services we provide have nothing to do with. Hi, hi, Chelsea, yes. Can I take you and Cookie out this week, maybe Thursday? No, no, no no no. Thank you, thank you, no. Okay look, I understand. You too. Ms. Pierce is still in France? Evan look, I could really use your help getting our proposal to her. - Have you lost your mind? What are you thinking leaving me here with this kid? I've been calling you all day, I thought you threw yourself off a fucking bridge or something! Listen you need to make other arrangements. You're not the only one here who has a business to run. I'm here for you but Leo, I know it's hard. I don't know what the hell I'm doing either. (morose music) Will you at least tell me what Tony would do? Leo, Leo? Come on, come back, I need you to be here right now. Can you hear me? Leo? (gentle music) - [Tony] I love you. - I'm sorry. - That's his last bottle. - Maya, I'm sorry. - I have a conference call in 45 minutes. - Just let me get Dylan ready, I'll come with you. - No. I am not about to let that kid cry all over my pitch. - Just let me-- - I said no. Just don't say anything, I'll call you later. - Maya. (baby crying) Fuck. - The door was open. I'm Heidi Wu. - I know who you are. - David Spenser, attorney. - I know who you are too. Practicing a little bit outside your zip code, aren't you? - We're here to release you from guardianship. - Release me? - Well given your recent personal loss. The county recognizes that you are not equipped-- - We're here to help. I can't imagine what we're gonna do at St. Agnes without him but you, I'm so sorry. Believe me, I understand. I know that this child is a terrible burden for you. Let us take him off your hands. - What will happen to him? - We'll find him a good home. You have my word. It's the right thing to do. - [Shannon] Sorry I'm late. - What do you think you're doing? - I'm babysitting. - The hospital administration has no right to inter-- - We're here as friends of the family. Which is more than I can say for you. - Mr. Kessler is surrendering the child to social services. - Hold on, not so fast. On what grounds? - Of his own accord. - Once again I seriously doubt that, but let's find out, shall we? Mr. Kessler, are you indeed surrendering Dylan? - [Heidi] The primary caretaker of this child is no longer-- - [Zack] I wasn't asking you. - [Heidi] Everyone knows that this baby is just one of Tony's pet projects. - That pet project has a name, you frigid cunt. - Leo, show me where the diapers are. - They're in the bedroom. - Leo, come show me please. - Well that sounded like a hell no to me. Well now we got that cleared up David please tell me you actually bothered to do some work before you came here like, I don't know, maybe went to go see the judge for probable cause, something like that. - I could always start with that nasty display of hostile temperament we all just witnessed. - [Zack] That's a bit of an overreach. I'd say he was grief-stricken. - Call it what you will. That child can't possibly be safe in an environment like this. - Fortunately on this side of the river, the voice of the people doesn't preside over custody cases. Judges do. Like Vanessa Joiner. You remember her, don't you David? Fanatically impartial. In fact, if she were to catch wind that you were trying to take Dylan out of a fit and loving home for, I don't know, say political reasons, she might actually hold that against you. Hmm. I like my odds on this one. I'm all in. (laughing) I gotta say, I love the look on his face when I show up. You think he'd be expecting me by now. (gentle music) - How you holding up? - Randy, what have you done? - Oh no no no, he didn't do anything, no. We came looking for him. I'm with the LAMDA Project, we're a legal aid foundation focused on LGBTQ rights. - I know who they are. - [Zack] Alright, then you know why they sent me. We're here to help you, so what do you need? - Hey, I was surprised to get your call. - Well your goals are very important to me. - I didn't realize you were in a relationship. - Well 68% of Americans are. - It must be terrible what happened to your lover. I mean your partner, and the little kid-- - You know, staying busy helps. This must be Sean Larson Sr. - [Sean] This is my father. - Well it's a pleasure to finally meet you sir. - Let's just get this over with. - Is there a problem? - The problem, Mr. Kessler, is that you are a homosexual. - Yes sir. And? - I can only guess as to the kind of ideas you're putting into Sean's head. - Well actually all these ideas came directly from Sean, I just helped him organize them. He's got some very specific goals. - My son doesn't have ideas, he does what he's told. And I will tell you as I told him, we don't need an image change. - Sir, in the past five years your market share has shrunk from 43% to 23% and that's just in the District alone. Your Mid-Atlantic numbers are getting worse-- - Don't you quote numbers to me, I know my business. Whatever we do, it will be a family decision. - Sir, it would be a mistake for you to allow your personal politics to get in the way-- - My politics are none of your business! - Well how about your pride then. - Your business at Larson Electronics ends today. Send an invoice to my office. I'll see that you are paid for whatever work it is you've done so far. - Sorry. - That didn't take very long. - Paparazzi chased me to most of my appointments. - Let me see what I can do about that. - What do they even want? - They smell blood in the water. I'm sorry, it's a poor choice of words. - He's been fussy all day, I think he misses his daddy. - Well his daddy's not coming back. He'll learn that soon enough. - I meant you. - Okay. It's time to feed him, ah shit, formula. - It's done, it's taken care of, you're fully stocked. - Now we got a lot to talk about but given the day you've already had I'll be brief. So David Spencer is famous for his tactics like his little ambush this morning so we're gonna need to have a strategy in place as soon as possible. - Strategy? What are you talking about? - I'm talking about our plan to stop them from taking your son. Now I'll be honest with you we lucked out drawing Judge Joiner, there's no way in hell she's gonna revoke your petition without proof of endangerment or neglect. And you understand what that means? That means that they can't take Dylan out of this house without just cause. - David Spenser is Family First's biggest legal gun. Zack follows his docket. Your case is important, otherwise Spenser wouldn't be here. - No, neither would I. - You know you keep saying we. Since when is it we? - Since this morning. And up until you have full and legal custody of Dylan. - You are not alone in this fight. - [Zack] LAMDA Project's gonna spare no expenses-- - There's not gonna be a fight. I think they should send him back. - Mr. Kessler. You feel overwhelmed, I get it-- - No, I'm not overwhelmed. - But the law is on your side here. - As long as they can place him into a real home and not back out into the welfare-- - He has a home. - No, with a mother and a father. - You're his father. - No Tony was his father. - Well according to the custody petition you're the father. - Only because I look better on paper. - This case could be critical to gay parents everywhere. - I am not gonna be the poster boy for your next political crusade. (baby crying) - That's not what this is about. - It's what they're about. - Look Mr. Kessler, I know this is a very difficult time for you and I'm truly sorry for your loss. I'm not gonna insult your intelligence by denying that yeah I'm here representing certain interests. - Exactly. - A lot of very important people have put forward a lot of money to support this particular civil rights issue and they're looking for someone who's gonna stand up and who's gonna fight. Now if you're not that person, I get it, that's great. But then the best I can do is offer you my condolences. - And you have. Now get out. - Leo-- - I said get out. - Okay. It's alright.

It's from Zachery Riley's office. Leo he's the top gun in custody litigation. How the hell'd you get Zack Riley? - He's a friend. - [Mike] What does it say? - It says adoption services has approved an interstate adoption. - Wait what does that mean? - It means they've approved an adoption outside of DC limits. - Dylan's already adopted. Oh shit. So it's true, you want to give him back? - It's probably for the best. - You cannot give them Tony's baby. Tony never would have wanted-- - Alright don't you talk to me about what Tony wanted! Like everything he did was so selfless? - He was. - No he was a selfish prick. He had to save every gutter rat he could find because he had to be the person to fix everything. Everything, everything. Right down to his picture perfect family. Now you want me to honor him for being some kind of stubborn asshole and getting himself killed? Well fuck that! Nobody could stop him from trying to fix anything. None of you could and neither could I. But I will be damned if I'm gonna get stuck here with his mess. - Time to go. - You're terrible. - Mike, now's not the time. - When is the time? - Not on the day we bury him. - [Maya] You cleared out your side of the office. - [Leo] I don't want to hold you back. - You're not holding me back. This is your golden ticket. - If the next family decides to dump Dylan he'll end up in Maryland or Delaware and you'll never get him back. - I think this is the best solution. - For who? - For Leo. He can't keep this baby. - Why not? - Because he doesn't want him. Leo, you know what it's like to have a father who doesn't really want you, you can't do that to another kid. - He won't, because he knows better. - You give me too much credit. - No, Tony did. - You people can't expect him-- - Shut up Maya! This is not about you. This is about a baby that you are responsible for. It doesn't matter what you agreed to. Tony is gone, he's not here to fix everything anymore. You need to stop and think about what is best for your son. So before you go off and cash in your golden ticket, think about what's best for Dylan. Five minutes man, just take five minutes and try being a parent. - Leo, you don't have to keep this baby if you don't want to. - You know, you're the second straight person to say that to me this week. - I'm on your side. (pensive music) - Your turn. No wait, let me guess, I'm heartless, selfish, you think I'm a coward? - What I think doesn't matter. - Well now I want to know. - At St. Agnes, we make life and death decisions every day. And sometimes it's the right one, sometimes it's not. But there are no easy ones. So we just do the best we can, Leo. We make the best decision we can at the time. And then we live with it. (baby crying) (phone ringing) - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Are you gonna get that? - Where's Shannon? - Work. You know we're never gonna get this kid to sleep unless you answer it or put it on vibrate, something. (shushing) And this was at the door when I came in. Maybe the paparazzi are trying to butter you up with jambalaya no less. - Hello? - Leo, it's Jesse. Ehrlich. I hope I'm not calling too early. - Yeah, I mean, no. Just, what do you want? - The job fair film fest is today. Of course it figures that after all the work that Tony did we have to move the whole thing inside. - So what's the problem? - Officer Manning sent some guys over to pick up the video equipment and they told us no. - What are you talking about? I arranged this months ago with Larson Electronics. They're donating a-- - Well when our guys got there the owner said to get the hell off his property or he would call the cops which is ironic since we sent cops to pick up the stuff in the first... But point is that we're dead in the water. (gentle music) - Jackie, Leo Kessler. Just making sure that you're all prepped and ready to cater tonight. Oh great, you talked to Jesse. Leo Kessler for Sean Larson Jr. And those permits they're good for 10 days, right? Jake, yes, yep, logos, all over them. I'm hoping for national coverage of course. Leo Kessler for Mr. Larson? Can you inform him that I've been... Was the youth opportunity project, right. Tony Parra was the... Thank you. Yes, yes.

That's a surprise. - Oh, well you said you liked it when people surprised you. - Well this is a rather big one. - For me as well, but nothing could keep me from our appointment today. - Excuse me Ms. Pierce. Sir, this club has a strict rule of no children. - I just fed him a bottle, he'll sleep the entire time. - I'm sorry sir. Club members of legal age only. - I see. Well rules are rules. Ms. Pierce, I apologize for taking you away from your day. Perhaps we can reschedule-- - Mark, is this patio in use for the next hour? - No ma'am. - Well good. Then we'll have the meeting right here. - Ma'am? - This patio is not part of the executive lounge, correct? - Yes well technically but-- - Please see that we're not disturbed. - Yes ma'am. - [Ms. Pierce] Thank you Mark. (baby crying) (baby laughing) (soft music) - I'll be damned. - I beg your pardon? - Did you hear him laugh? He's never laughed before, not for me. You know Tony would dance with him and sing to him. Said he liked the vibrations. But I've never been able to figure out what he wanted. - Oh my god. You're that gay from the news. - I suppose that is me this week. - I had no idea. - Well you've been out of the country. - I mean you seem so-- - Just let me show you my sponsorship pyramid, it illustrates all the different ideas I have-- - No, that won't be necessary. - I see. Let me guess. - What I want to know Mr. Kessler is can you tell me how does a girl 15 years old like my daughter, how does she know at 15 that she likes girls or boys? Can you help me understand that, Mr. Kessler? - I'm afraid I don't have a chart for that. But I can try. - You? - It's a Southern thing. You send food when someone passes. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. About Tony. He was a good guy. - Yeah you know can I come get that later? - Sure. Yeah. And don't sweat the crying. Kinda used to it now. (baby crying) - Okay, okay, good boy. Okay, hold on. Okay come on Dylan, you were being so good an hour ago. We got to the ice queen, that's good, right? Is that good? (baby crying) Alright you win, you win. (shower running) ♪ But I'm enchanted by the magic you do ♪ It's just the crazy way that you're affecting me ♪ It only happens every time I think about you You like that one? Good, 'cause it's the only one I know. Ow, god you couldn't have waited two more minutes? Just try to hold on for number two until I get you some diapers, okay? Oh yeah, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, almost done, almost done. - You left your door open again. - [Leo] Yeah we were in kind of a hurry. - Yeah I figured. I sent someone as soon as a I got the call from Randy but you had already gone. Oh. Takes some getting used to huh? I got three myself. Hey Dylan. You know he looks like you? - Why do people keep saying that? - Look at him. Little ears, nose, his chin. His eyes are probably gonna change color too before he finishes growing. - Well it feels like pandering, like people want something. - They're just trying to say you look like family. (soft music) - What if it's true? - What if what's true? - They say it only matters what Heidi can prove, and everyone knows this was Tony's idea. You know, the big hero, the self appointed protector of the weak. - And what about now? - I think it was different with Dylan. I think he really did just want us to be a family. - I'm not asking about Tony, I'm asking about you. What do you want now? - I think I want the same. I want us to be a family. - That's all I need to hear. - When you think about it, no one gets to pick who their family is, right? So sorta makes sense the way that Dylan came to us. - That's one way of looking at it. - So now what? - Now you leave the legal stuff to me. - Well it's just me and you now. Like the sound of that big guy? You stopped crying. - I'll let myself out. - Looks like we have ourselves a plan. (laughing) (gentle music) - Your church has been spamming me. - It's not my church. William Parra asked me to come. - Oh. - You look great. - I know. I miss you. - I miss you too. - Good then it's settled. You're coming back to work. - Maya. - I've made up my mind, we're gonna get a bassinet or whatever in the office okay and we'll schedule conference calls around naptime. Let's finish building our empire. In a few years you can come back here and get all the fresh air and green grass that you want. - Ask me tomorrow. - He really is starting to look like you. - Thanks. It's okay, it's okay. - I thought we were neighbors. My apologies, the welcome wagon's been pretty busy recently. - Busy is good in this economy. - Well. Paul Rich. - Leo. - I know, you're a celebrity. In case you haven't notice you've moved in to the fastest growing gayborhood in DC. - My mother in law will be very happy to hear that. - My wife's thrilled too, but I'm working on her. How do you like it so far? - Well we picked the house. It's great, the house is great. You know, it's quiet. - Well people either love it or hate it here. - Nothing's turned out the way I thought. - Never does, does it? (gentle music) - Look. - Hey! - My turn to host dinner night. - Hey I'm Trav, what's your name? - Ah it's Paul. - Excuse me. - Good to meet you. - Oh my god he's so cute. - I'm gonna miss these in Chicago. - [Leo] A friend of ours is moving to Chicago. - I'll leave you to it. Oh, I'm trying out a new recipe with pureed pears. You think your son would be interested in being one of my tasters? - Pears? I think he's love it. - Until tomorrow then. And welcome to the neighborhood.
