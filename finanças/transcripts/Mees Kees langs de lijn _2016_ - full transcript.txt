Mr. Casey, we're ready. A bit more to the left. Awesome. - This is super cool! Tobias, are you ready? - Completely ready, Mr. Casey. Mr. Casey? OK, here we go. Go! Sep, your stairs come up now Great, Aukje. Now yours, Tom. Yes, this is so exciting. Blow, Winston. Fred, ready to pound? - Yes. Now! Wow, what's that awesome thing? Hold on, guys, we're nearly there. Join me. Three... ...two, one... I hear it all the way in the... For the Talent and Future Project. - Mr. Casey... Can I have a word with you? MISTER TWISTER Project 2037. A Talent and Future Project. There's a reason why we're doing this. It's about focus and discipline. Not about making a mess in the classroom. No, I wanted to show that one thing leads to another. Let Mr. Hank be your example. Mr. Hank uses the Talent and Future Project... ...to participate in the school soccer tournament. You could do something like that. - I want to focus on the future. I came up with a machine... A machine that will probably make a lot of noise and mess. Or won't it? What's a good idea? Your class participating in the school soccer tournament as well. Soccer? I'm not good at it. - It's the sport of champions. It's about insight, stamina, strategy and about talent. And about the future? - That too, of course. Good luck on your way to the champion's cup. You may be a talented soccer coach. Careful! At my last school, one of the teachers pulled a wire once... ...and the whole classroom collapsed on to her head. Really? - Yes, it was built by baboons. I'm gonna pound you. Watch it. Come here. Mr. Casey, help. - Hey... Guys, come on. Let's start the lesson. Yes, Aukje? - What's that thing? The 2037 project is about talent and the future. Your future. And this... This is a time machine. You go in on one side as a child... ...and get out as what you want to be when you grow up. You can bring something or dress up or... - I'll be a stand-up comedian. So what should I bring? - You can tell a joke, Sep. High five. Think carefully about what your talents are, then you will know what you want to be. Hey Tobias, do you know what you're going to bring? I'm not sure yet. Firefighter? Something with computers. Or... car mechanic. Or baker. You like bread, don't you? And cake. Sure, but... That way you'll always have cake for free. Always. Always may be a bit much. Sep, where were you? You have soccer practice today. Penalty day. Hi, Tobias. We're going to go all-out today. Here. Hold on. Sorry. Soccer. Forgot. - That's OK. Fluids are very important. Drink it. Hold on. Everything is about focus and concentration. And then: bam! In the corner. Always pick the corner the keeper doesn't pick. Get it? See you tomorrow. Always pick a corner. If the keeper chooses left, then you choose the right corner... Hi, Tobias. Checking out whether Harley gets enough cuddles? Is dog-cuddler an actual job? I'm sure it is. Cup of tea? Keep this to yourself, OK? Come in. Look... Both brands claim their cookies are the best. But that's not possible. Only one can be the best. But which one? This one? Or... that one? Go ahead. Or you can't test them. Oh, that must be Casey. Hi, Mr. Casey. Hey, Tobias. Was that Marie-Louise? - What? Her? No. Yes. I was thinking about what I was going to say to her, but she's already gone. Weren't you going to hang out with Sep? - He had to play soccer. Soccer. Dreus is making me put together a soccer team in our class. Do you happen to know someone Who would like to join in? I know someone, but he's not good at playing soccer. That's great. Neither am I. - Good. The perfect combination. Do you know what a soccer coach is supposed to do? Get drinks at half time. - Good. That sounds easy. Mom? Yes? - Dad, right... Was he good at soccer? Very good. Really? Hlgh flve. I want a hlgh flve too. Hone/, be careful. There he goes agaln. Ya/! 5-0. He always scored. Really? Yes. Awesome. James Bond. Professor. Who feels like flying? Road worker. OK guys, the door is closed, the lights are on... ...and we're arriving in the year 2037. In 2037 everything will be different. There's no more hunger, there's world peace, and Aukje... Quick, sit down! ...has a job as a... Doctor! Or president. But I didn't have the clothes for that. Wonderful. Doctor. Of course. Let's see if I have a picture of it. Tobias, are you ready? I can't think of anything. Great. Exciting. We'll save you for last. Sep, you? - Yes. Good luck. OK guys, 2037. Who'll give me a hand? - Me. I was first. OK Jacky, come on. Fred, James Bond. OK, 2037. The clock ticks and ticks. The machine turns and turns. We arrive at 2020... ...2030... ...and we arrive at 2037. And Sep... ...is a... Ta-da! Wow, stand-up comedian. Let's see if I have a picture of that. Mr. Casey, wait. How do you make a pancake like you? Butter him up! What did the pancake say to the almond? You're nuts. An apple a day keeps... That's easy: the doctor away. No, an apple a day keeps one soccer goal a day. Oh, right. Guys, soccer. We have to participate in the soccer tournament this year. So maybe we should practice this afternoon. Very good. Creative, very creative. Very good. Nice. Nice ball, Lisa. Hey Koen, pass me the ball. Want me to jump in? I want to go in. - No, Jacky, wait. It might float in this direction. Now something important: the team. Who feels like participating? Me! OK, fine. Then the whole class is in the team. I'm in. I'm the first one in. Tom, go ahead. This soccer rule book says that an official team has 11 players. And a school team only six. So if the whole class plays... ...the team will be way too big. Oh, right. That's true. So let's see who can make it on Friday afternoon. Friday afternoon? - That's when the first match is. I have a piano lesson. - I go horseback riding. I'm allowed to go with my dad. - Karate. But you can make it on Friday afternoon. - Yes. OK, then we have exactly the right number. Tom? - One too many, but I'm no good anyway. One too many? Not really. Exactly the right number. Six players and one assistant coach. - Oh, right. That's all we need. Aukje? Oh, right. We need a soccer ball. Got it. Are you alright, Mr. Casey? See you tomorrow, Mr. Casey. - Bye. I thought... ...I'd check out how deep it is for the safety of the class. Are you OK? - I'm fine, mom. Stay. He's still being good. - Great. I'll check up on Harley in the kitchen. Why don't you sit down? There's still a bit of duckweed. All right? - You smell nice. Like a ditch. - But... Very nice. No, come on. Know what you two should do? Go on a date some afternoon. Without those dogs. OK, it's a deal. Next Wednesday at 5 o'clock. Next Wednesday? - At 5 o'clock. Five o'clock. - At the Pink Elephant. You'll love it. Oh, I think he needs to... - Oh, dear. Come. See you on Wednesday. Wow, what a lot of people. Welcome at the school soccertournament. Is ever/bod/ In the mood? Nice. How many teams will join? A lot! I think I see Aukje. Hey, guys. - Hi, Mr. Casey. New teams can slgn up at the sldellne. I think we have to go over there. Oh, right. Yes, of course. A school soccer tournament is a classic drop-out tournament... ...in which the participants play four matches in a mixed competition. The winners of the most matches will face each other... ...or the teams who scored the most goals. Let's just play some fun matches. Tobias! Casey! Hey, mom. Nice banner. Go and get 'em. Go and get 'em, Winston, Sep... ...Hasna... Thls Is the flrst match forteam 6B. They're read/. The referee has whlstled. Come on, guys. Eye on the ball. - Eye on the ball! Close the defense. - Close the defense! But aren't they attacking now, Tom? - Sorry. Wrong chapter. Come on! 1 - 0 forteam 6B. Mind your defense. Forwards! Ah, a monumental mlss. No problem. A few more minutes, guys. Thirty seconds, Mr. Casey. - Thirty seconds, guys! Twenty-seven. - Twenty-seven! Twenty-five. - Tom,just watch. Good! Keep going! Very good, guys. 2 - 0 forteam red. Mom! Careful for your back. Bend your knees and then lift. Casey, don't look so worried. - I don't look worried. It's just broken. It'll be fixed in no time. How do you know? - Everyone knows that. You don't need to buckle me up. I'll hold on tight. I'm coming with you. No,just stay with those kids. You don't need to stay. - I'm coming along. At my previous school, a teacher broke her leg right off. Fred isn't here, you know. - Oh, right. That's true. Now what? The team leaves the pitch at the end of the game. Well, it's broken, Mrs. Brown. Have a look. Look, here. Your hip is broken. Can I go home soon? We'll have to wait and see when you're mobile again. On crutches or maybe using a walker. Anyway, first the surgery and then you're with us for a few days to recover. Homecare will come to your home to see when your mom can be released. When... - When it's safe for her to go home. OK? Goodbye. I'll see you later. Bye. Will you manage on your own? - Yeah. Of course, mom. Don't forget about Harley. Come here. Oh, want to go for a walk? Hey, Mr. Casey. - Hey, Harley! I took the key from the flower pot. - Oh, the secret key. Good. And? How's your mom? - She broke her hip. It will heal, but she can't come home until everything's safe. Isn't it safe now? I think they mean a bed in the living room or something. Come on. I think Harley would love taking you home. It's 6 o'clock, tlme to get up. Weekend Is over, It's Monda/. Oh, right. You need to go outside. Hello, Casey Brown speaking. - The son of Mrs. Brown? Yes, that's me. This is Mr. Koster, Homecare. Is this a good moment to talk? Hello? Hello, are you still there? I can't hear you. Can you hear me? Ah, you're back. - Yes, I'm back. Can I come by this afternoon? An appointment with Homecare this afternoon. Yes... - Is that possible? Then I can... Good. I'll be there at 4 o'clock. Bye. What am I going to do with you all day? Omelet. I made it extra well-done today. Extra good. OK guys, let's start the lesson. Will we work on the Talent and Future Project? Sure. How about we put Harley in the time machine? Yes! So Harley, let's see what you'll be in the future. Maybe you'll be a police dog. - Or a space dog. A hunting dog. - Or a farting dog. Mr. Casey! I can hear you all the way down the hall Mr. Casey, the school isn't a dog shelter. - No, Mrs. Dreus. Because of the situation with your mother, I'll let it slip But don't let it become a habit. - Yes, Mrs. Dreus. I mean: No, Mrs. Dreus. - And that cardboard box? A time machine. It's about talent and future. - Mr. Casey, talent and future... Talented teachers stick to the schedule... ...or they won't have a future here. Come on, Harley. Aukje? What's on the schedule? - Talent and Future Project, right? Let's do something from the regular schedule. Math then. Get out your books. Bye, Mr. Casey. - Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. So no soccer practice today. - He said we'll make up for it. When? Keep going. OK, stop here. Take your positions. Twenty push-ups. One, and two, and three... Backs straight. Should we practice with Mr. Hank? - I'd rather not. Then we have to do push-ups. - Push-ups are easy. I can do a 100, no problem. And nine, and ten. Keep up the rhythm. 100. I already did 95 this morning. Well, okidoki. Let's go through this list. The doorsteps have to go, you need a bed in the living room. The toilet has to be raised, you need a shower on the first floor. And those steps to the kitchen are a problem. And the whole place needs a proper clean-up. A good scrub. Will that dog stay here? Harley? - Not a good idea. He'll walk around, your mother can trip over him. Can he stay somewhere else for a month or something? No. No, I don't think so. - Then he has to be tied up. Because if your mother falls again, Casey... That won't be pretty, right? Okidoki, you have to take this to the hospital tomorrow... ...so she can start to exercise right away. But I have to teach tomorrow. But the sooner your mother can walk, the sooner she can come home. At least, if your house is up to snuff. Of course. - We're making a deal here. I'll come and checkup soon. Good luck and tootles. Tootles. Should I help with the schedule? No. No, I'm just figuring out how to do everything... Look Mr. Casey, no hands. Awesome, a walker! Tom, soccer is played with two goals, right? Yes, two goals of 2.44 meter by 7.32 meter. And 6B is a serious team, so we have to keep our promise. The first goal is: running practice with the team. And the second goal is: taking the walker to my mom. No, Mr. Casey. They don't mean those kinds of goals, because... I think these goals are clear, guys. We have to go. A little bit further. Turning around. There. A few steps an hour and you walk right out of the hospital. I hope so, Casey. I have to arrange a few things and then you can come home. Go, Rashida. - Jackie, you'd better not... Jackie! Hello, Mrs. Brown. How are you doing? They're taking good care of me. But... It's only old people in here and they whine... ...and smell of soup. I just want to go home. And how are you doing? I bet Casey can't make omelets. No, not really. When I get home, I'll make the best omelet in the world for you. And another one right after that. Let's see what we have here. High bed in living room... ...raise toilet, doorsteps gone, dog to the kennel... Casey, this list! We're not taking Harley to the kennel. Where's that walker? I'm going home, raised toilet or not. Mom, wait! Harley will be fine. I already have a plan for this afternoon. Really? The head is at the front, the tail is at the back. He has a wet nose, hair all over his body... ...and one leg on every corner. That's a dog in a nutshell. Yes, Aukje? Mrs. Dreus said Harley wasn't allowed here anymore. True, but biology's on the schedule, so she can't mind, can she? A dog is much more than just a head and some legs. He's also very sweet and loyal and soft. Yes, Sep? - Is that true? Yes. - Is he really that soft? Who'd like to investigate that from up close? Me! - Me! Harley! Mr. Casey, I know you're worried about your mother. But you've lost control. - I'm trying... Trying is not enough. You have to take some time off to take care of her. That's the only way. - Right. I'll take over the class for a few days. And the soccer team. What? That's not necessary. - Mr. Casey... ...you can only keep a few balls up in the air at the same time. Balls is the appropriate word in connection with the soccer tournament. Anyhow, rest assured in these stressful times. I'll take care of 6B. - OK. And I'll phone a wonderful kennel, so that dog doesn't get in your way. Kennel? Don't you want your mother to come home soon? Get rid of all the distractions. No dog, no teaching, no soccer. I'll tell your class. Hello, this is Els Dreus. I'm calling about a dog. Yes, yes. Oh, right. When was that again? Never mind, no problem. - Go deep, deep! Deep, go deep, Patrick. Come on! Stay with the ball, stay with the ball! Ain't I right? Stay with your man! Cover him, there's a gap. OK, stay with your man. Careful at the back! Hey! Wait a minute, ref. That was no goal! That was offside. Come on, ref! - Dad... Are you blind? Come on, Hank... What a nutcase... They are losing, Hank. - Stay there. Onl/ pla/ers and coaches are allowed on the fleld. Sorry, ref. Supporters should sta/ behlnd the fence. Sorry, ref, sorry. Well, guys. Are we ready? This way, please. Follow me, 6B. I wish Mr. Casey was here. The game wlll start an/ mlnute. Is it just for a few days? - Two days. Three at most. This wonderful animal will survive that. There. He's never been alone. - It's full of friends here. I mean, without us. Harley, you heard that? It's full of friends here. I'll give him a quiet place to stay. And a basket. Come on, come... There, you go inside. Come on, Casey. Go and take care of everything. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do some... defensive attacks. Stay with the ball and choose position. Forward, forward! Tobias, look. Ball, leg. Ah, too bad. OK, assemble the bed. The laundry. Stay together, guys... Winston, Winston, you're offside. Winston, look at Dreus. Right, now you lost it. Thank you. You're not just playing by yourself. Get close. Get close, get close! Who's there? Anyone? Aukje, Aukje! 2 - 0! Guys! What a strong team! What are we doing? What are we doing, guys? 5 - 0! Tobias, good. Tobias, Tobias! Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tobias. In, in, in. Missed. Tobias? Remember? Straight ahead. Not... Anything's still possible. That is, if you had a different attitude. What's this, what's this? Who's there, who's there? Aukje, Aukje! Team green has won, congratulatlons! If I add up the goals of the other teams in our group and compare that to our loss... ...we're still three points within the schedule. What? We have to play another match. Well, boys and girls, this was terrible. This way we'll never be the champions. No, no, no... Yes. Marie-Louise? - Casey, where are you? We were supposed to meet at five. At five? Was that today? In the Pink Elephant, without the dogs. Oh, dear. How stupid of me. I forgot. I'm doing jobs for my mom, but nothing is finished. And she wants to come home and... I'm sorry. I... - You could have called. Yes. But hold on, I'm coming straight away and I'll explain everything. No, never mind. I'm... Where are you? The Pink Elephant, that's... I'll just go home. Sorry. I'll get it. The next one is a goal. Twenty penalties and I missed twenty times. Good job, if I say so myself. - Try aiming beside the goal. That's what I was doing. Will you join me for dinner? Spaghetti... No, I'm going home. Yes, /es, /es! No, not whlle /m fllmlng. I was... I was just watching it again. He was really talented. So are you, aren't you? You just have to find out what you're good at on the pitch. And outside the pitch. Tomorrow we're talking again about what we want to be when we grow up. Ah, son. You don't have to know that yet. You have years to figure it out. Come on, guys. Come in. Talent and future is about competence and life goals... ...not about crazy cardboard boxes. It's a time machine! - Yes. We shall continue our math. Let's turn to page 60. Minus five plus nine. Who can solve that one? You mean the square root of 4096? Or the square of eight? - Excuse me? Two to the power of six? 64, miss Dreus. 60 minus five plus nine is 64. Yes, 64. Exactly. Please take out your books. Hello? Mr. Casey? Mr. Casey? Tobias? My mom isn't allowed to shower upstairs... ...so I have to come up with something down here. Like this? In the middle of the room. Oh, Mr. Casey. I think I can finish it tonight. - All of this? I'd forgotten about Marie-Louise. We had a date, but I didn't show up. She was sitting there all by herself. But doesn't she know you're helping your mom? I should have called. Come, I need to finish this. First that bed, then the shower... ...then raise the toilet and then the doorsteps. But Mr. Casey, why not let me help? I was looking for someone to go and visit Harley. Want to do that? - Of course. OK, I'll call to say you're on your way. Here's the address. And Tobias... Can you kiss him for me? That's from Mr. Casey. And this one's from me. Do you miss your masters? They miss you too, you know. They do. They do... Sir? Could I take him for a walk? - Sure, but be back by six. Sorry. Did anyone see you? I don't think so. Tobias did a great job. I had no idea I'd miss him this much. And your leg? I've been doing five laps a day. And Casey told me the house is nearly ready. Isn't it? - Nearly... How's school without Casey there? He was doing that fun future project, right? That's over now. - Oh? Shame... I don't know what I want to be when I grow up anyway. Really? I haven't really got any special talents. - What? You are extremely talented. You just brought me Harley in a box. It doesn't matter. Just make sure you can come home soon. Harley! Welcome... Welcome at the school soccertournament. So with one striker, three midfielders... ...and two defenders, we can execute the 1-3-2 system the best. We pick up the ball here and take it forward along the left side. The defense mounts pressure by going with them. And goal! Yes, Aukje? - Are we the red or the green lines? What? No. Look, I'll show you. When you get the ball... ...to support the defense and the defense support the strikers... ...to nip a potential threat in the bud. Understood? Mr. Hank? Mr. Hank! How was the match? The end result you mean? We... We lost. We're out. Did you hear that, guys? Do you know what that means? We have to win! And? If we lose one more match we're out, fortunately. But isn't it fun too? This is a nice photo of the whole class and Mr. Casey. Mr. Casey won't be able to make the final. He has to take care of his mom. Sometimes you have to support a person who needs help. \x22Place bed in living room, a shower on the first floor...\x22 Sentence 16: \x22Because of that measure the traffic has become safer.\x22 \x22Because of that measure...\x22 What are you looking at? Think an architect can remove a doorstep? What? Or that a builder... ...can put a bed together? For Mr. Casey? - Yes! And a stand-up comedian can clean. Tobias, that's not allowed. You have to ask first. Sep, is this allowed? - Sure. I asked. Toilet. Shower. Tidy up. The bed. Casey, what are you doing here? - Me? Homecare is coming to check out the house. We made that appointment together. Today? - He'll be there in 30 minutes. But I still have to... I came to bring clean clothes. - Oh, Casey! I don't want clean clothes, I want to go home. Is everything finished? Almost. Honestly. Almost. Sorry... Excuse me. The shower is ready. OK. And? Did we do everything? - I think so. But we still need to tidy up. - Yeah. It's a complete mess. - Yeah... That gentleman will wait for us. Come on. ROADSIDE ASSISTENCE Hello, this is Casey Brown. - This is Frits Delen, Homecare. Listen, I've got some car trouble. I don't know how long I'll be, but I think about an hour. Ah, an hour. That's good. I mean, what a shame. - Yes. Good luck with your car trouble. - Thanks. See you soon. An hour. There. It's fixed. - Already? The air supply wasn't right. And I also replaced the hose of the windscreen wiper liquid. See? Much safer when you're on the road. Here you go. I thought you'd be another hour. No, it just turned out to be a thingy. The... What do you call it? That thingamajig. It works. Come on, let's go inside. It isn't quite finished yet. I didn't manage the entire list. It was so much. - Right. Know what? We'll make it an interim check-up. My mom really wants to go home. - I get that, but Casey... It has to be safe. OK? It looks great. The bed is fine. The shower. Good job with those ducks. This... You solved this very well. Nice and creative. And it's clean around here. Let's have a look in the utility room. Wow! The laundry is even folded. Everything's OK. It looks good. I'll make sure your mother can go home tomorrow. Have a nice day. Toodles. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye, miss. Come on, guys. Wonderful, finally going home. Casey, this thing is great. I made it. With Rashida. You girls did a great job. And I vacuumed with Wahed. Thank you. It's never been this clean around here. Look at this. Who came up with this shower? Very clever. Now I don't need to go upstairs. I can't go upstairs anyway. It's a wonderful bed. Good job, Rashida and Koen. What's this for? Wonderful. Is that a cake over there? We made it. - You made it yourself? How wonderful. And a raised toilet? It was super easy. - Great! You're so smart. And who cleaned the windows? - My mother taught me that. Super! And who's so good in ironing? - We! And that's so difficult, I don't have talent for that. And you kept saying you don't have a talent. Well, I don't. - What? How can you say that after all this? I didn't do anything. Who came up with the plan to do this? I did. - Exactly. You. You saw what everyone was capable of and put them to work. That's a big talent. Really? - What do you think? A huge talent. Now we can pick up Harley. I think he's had enough of that kennel. I think all those dogs have had enough. - Yeah, I think so too. If only you knew someone who knows where to get 20 dog walkers. Mr. Casey! Why isn't 6B training? The final is tomorrow. But we are training, Mrs. Dreus. You don't have time for that, now with your mother. She's back home, with a wheelchair, a walker and two crutches. So I've got plenty of time for the class and the team. I can train them. This is training? Well, those dogs are good for the motivation. And... ...ball control. And... ...getting in shape. Make her a striker and we'll win. - Exactly. But if it's OK with you, I'd like to coach the team at the final. You coach again? Mrs. Dreus, I know we wouldn't have gotten this far without you. But I'd like to finish what we started. You know that Mr. Hank's team got knocked out. Then you'll understand that team 6B is the school's only hope now. Yes, I understand. Then you'll also understand that I'll remain this team's coach. Guys, come on, let's train. Go, go. Shirts on and practice. Go and get 'em. Welcome on the fourth and last da/. And now It's up to the goal dlfference who wlll be number one, two and three. And who wlll be fourth. Team 6B! This doesn't look to me like a team of champions. We have to focus. In a minute it's sink or swim. Got that? And there Is team red! Bo/s and glrls, good luck! Come on, guys! Defense! There is a system. Who stands there? 1 - 0! Come on. Forward, forward. Get closer together. I don't see a system. I told numbers, I told systems. I can't see a system! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good job, Tobias. Go, Tobias! - This has to work. Good shot! I missed. - But nice and fast. System 1-3-2. It's there for a reason. Defend! Hasna, come on! Get close together, get close together. This is getting strange. Stay close to the ball... Defend! Guys, this isn't working. Everything's going wrong. You're not following your lines. The system doesn't work this way. And that's... Do you understand... For me... Mrs. Dreus, are you OK? Mr. Casey, I don't get it. I explained the 2-3-1 system on the half pitch. We practiced the offside fall. We watched the footage of Johan Cruijff's time in Barcelona. And I showed them all the lines for a frontal attack, along the flanks... ...and across the midfield. It's as if they can't remember the simplest tactics. Maybe... Maybe I should take over for the second half. Are you sure, Mr. Casey? The coach will be held responsible for the team's performance. I don't think that's a problem. Are you looking for a coach for the second half? It's pointless, Mr. Casey. We've already lost. - Come on, it's not that bad. At these kinds of moments the coach gives a pep talk. Look, here it is. Right. A pep talk... Come closer, guys. The lines on the pitch are 7 centimeters wide... ...and are applied with white lime paint. The grass is mowed to exactly 4 centimeters, so the ball doesn't meet with resistance. Wrong page. Right. I was wondering... Guys, come on. What difference does it make? The only thing that matters is having memories of having fun together. Right? So go, go, go. Toodles. And score, if you can manage. - OK, Mr. Casey. Hey, go get 'em. If I were able to score as well as my dad... Just use your own talent. A good assist is just as important as scoring. Come on, 6B! We can do it! Good! Tobias! That was the best assist ever! Yes! - Guys, look. For the top athletes. - Food project! What a shame. We should have been champions. But we are champions. - We came in fourth, Mr. Casey. But that makes us the champions of the losers. Champions of the losers. There you go. Omelet sandwich, Mr. Casey. - Good. Stop! You'll ruin your appetite for tonight. - We have nothing on. We don't. But you do. Marie-Louise. That date you forgot is on for tonight. Really? But I have to take my mom home. - Who do you think called her? Get out of here. Come on, Mr. Casey. The grass is mowed to exactly 4 centimeters... ...so the ball doesn't meet with resistance. Sorry. I thought I'd give it a try, but... Stupid. - Get him! Well, this is not... Sentence 18: You can draw the figures... ...with a pencil. You can... Sorry. Sep, is this allowed? That? Sure. I asked... School is not a dog shelter. - No, Mrs. Dreus.
