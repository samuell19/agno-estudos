What's your problem? -My problem? I'm almost 30. I make 300 espressos a day for minimum wage. -And you're writing the novel that will not die. -Both: But it's gonna be great. -It is. -Yeah, doesn't Stephen King write like three books a year? -Five, and that proves my point. -What's it up to, uh, pound wise? -1,800 pages, asshole. You know, the thing is, by the time I was 30, I thought I'd have a novel out there, maybe a movie deal. -I know. -I didn't think I'd be another guy slinging coffee. -Look at me, Nick. I have a 150 IQ and I wipe the nose grease off of glasses all day long. -Yeah, but you have a dental plan. I don't even have a college degree. I don't know how to do anything. I've been like, an office temp, a house painter, a Super Shuttle driver. -You drove a Super Shuttle? -He wrecked a Super Shuttle. -Somehow, that doesn't surprise me. -Thing is, I just want something different. -Judy: Ah, you're just like me, Nicky.

I got into Stanford. -Alex: Really? That's terrific. When did you find out? -Today. (chuckles) -That's great. -Yeah. Yeah, it's great. -Call me wacky, but you don't seem so thrilled. -No, it's great, really. I don't know. Pfft! -What does Bob think? -Well, he assumes that I'm gonna go to Idaho with him. -This could be an issue. -Yup. (laughs) (sighs) It-- it could. I don't know, you guys. I just don't know if I can see myself as Ms. City Planner in Pocatello, Idaho. Eh. -City planner? -Hey, it's ecologically-minded. Job of the '90s. At least he's doing something that matters. -Yeah, but what am I gonna do in Idaho? -Eat potatoes. -Make potato soup, potato pie. -Ha. Fuck that. -(jazz music plays) -Oh, yeah, it's nice to see that juice working there, buddy. -Alex: Yeah, it's like, the hottest party in town. -So what's the alternative? Go for the house, the car, the white picket fence... -I don't know. I don't know. Bob moved, and... well, they're coming for my stuff next week. -Judy! -What? I didn't know I was gonna get accepted into Stanford. -So he doesn't know you're going? -Well, I haven't exactly said yes. -But Bob thinks you're going. He must have said something like, "Are you coming with me or..." -No, he just assumed that. -Assumed? -Yeah. Okay, we didn't talk about it. -I thought you were a Communications major. -I was. I learned that men and women speak different languages. -Hey. -Bartender: Be right with ya, chief. -Whatever you say, guy. -Nick: Lose the attitude, man. You're gonna get us kicked out. -Nick, look around you. We're not gonna get kicked out of here. Believe me. Nice ears. -At least I dressed up. -I didn't want to look like you. Besides, I'd rather go naked than wear fur. -What's wrong with the way I look? -I think you look cute. -Cute? -You're a bunny. -And? -Heineken. -Heineken. -Heineken. -Hey. -When did you get that? -Alex: I got it in the mail. -What, are they handing out gold cards to all the flunkies in the mailroom now? -I'm an assistant now, thank you very much. -You know, that's disgusting. How do I get one? -What, they don't take plastic? -Not when it's declined. -All you, buddy. -Thanks, Nick. Hey, Nicky, where are we? -Uh, we're on the 10. -Oh, good. Get off on Fairfax. I think we might have missed your exit. -What? Where the fuck are we? -Oh, I'd say about 30 miles from Palm Springs. -Oh, no! What are you fucking smoking? I have to work today! -We're almost there. -Almost where? -You'll see. -Oh, man. -Oh, my head. Don't step on the seat. -I-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -How do you feel? -Like death. -I'm gonna go get something to eat, all right? -No, no. Alex, come on. You have a real job too. Make him take us home. -If we go in there with him in that bunny suit, we're gonna get our asses kicked, I'm telling you. -Who asked you? -Listen, I'm starving. It's just breakfast. You'll feel better if you get something to eat too. -(groans) All right, maybe coffee. All right? And then we're going back to L.A. -Deal. -Alex? -I don't know if I'm hungry or bored. -You guys go ahead. I'm gonna make a few phone calls. -Who are you gonna call at this hour of the morning? -Some of us work, Nick. -Sorry. -(dial tone) -(buttons beeping) -(country music playing) -Gosh. You know, I've always wanted a black velvet Elvis painting. -Don't talk about The King like that. -What? -I'm not talking about '50s Elvis. '50s Elvis was a pussy. I'm talking about '70s Elvis. -300 pounds of Elvi. -"Elvi"? -Yeah, all packed into a full-flavor white satin jumpsuit with rhinestones and a collar you could land a plane on. -Do you ever frighten yourself? Just no, yes? -Where's our waitress? Oh, there's... -Nick: Thanks, pretty lady. -What is that? -Grease. -Waitress: Eggs over easy, hashbrowns, biscuits with gravy. -That's why Elvis died fat. -You know it, baby. -You know what you want? -Uh, yeah, can I get one of those truckers with fries? -Just a coffee, thanks. -Uh, yeah, can I get a plain croissant with some kiwi on the side, maybe? -No. -Okay, maybe some low-fat yogurt with some granola on top? -No. -Okay, let me ask you something. Is there anything you guys cook here that is not prepared with lard? -No. -Okay. -So you folks on vacation? -Actually, it's a kidnapping. Thanks. -You from Palm Springs? -No. Actually, I'm a supermodel and I waitress here for kicks. -Really? Yeah, I'm an agent. I-- I-- Oh, I have no cards. You're lovely. -Judy: Look at these great postcards I got for my mother. -Nick: Great. -Judy: So where the hell are you taking us? -Nick: It's a place called The Salton Sea. It was an old resort in the '40s, then something happened to the water and the place just sort of died out. -Alex: A sea? You mean like an ocean? There are no oceans in the desert, Nick. -Nick: There are no dinosaurs in the desert either. -Judy: If we go to this place, you'll be happy? -Alex: Who would ever wanna leave L.A.? Nice graffiti. This place is a dump, Nick. -Jeez. You know, I haven't been out here in a long time. -I wonder why. -I thought they tore it down. -What's so special about this place? -Well... -Judy: Oh, my God. -Nick: You know how in the city when there's no noise that you can put your finger on, there's still that background noise? -Alex: Urban static. -Yeah. Well, it's just nice to be someplace where you can't hear it. You think I'm a fuck up, don't you? -I think that you could try a little harder. -How much harder could I try? I make coffee all day and I write that fucking book all night. You know, it takes everything I got just to get out of bed in the morning. -Why don't you try typing "The End"? -You make it sound like I'm afraid. -Aren't you? -Man, fuck! -No, I think it'd be great to finish the book and have everybody hate it, you know, and find out I'm not as brilliant as I think I am. -Alex: Fuck! -I'm concerned. So, I've been meaning to ask you, how come you wanna work in Hollywood? -Because talking fast is what I do best maybe? -Yeah, I hadn't noticed. -I dazzled you with my bullshit too, huh? -I know a lot of people smart, just like you, who do pretty much whatever they want. They all sell out for the flash. -Yeah, it's easy, Nick. You should try it sometime. Learn to loosen up, have some fun. -I'm not very good at fun. -Really? I hadn't noticed. You? -So, what's your plan? -Plan? -Yeah. -(chuckles) Uh, I have no plan. I have bills-- credit card payments, stuff like that. But what can you do? Can't afford my life? Oh well. -What you doin'? -Don't talk to me. -What, you're mad? -Yeah, I'm mad at you. God, I've got shit to do today. because of your little kidnapping here. -Aw, come on, Jude. You're hungover. You don't feel well. -No, yeah, I really don't feel well. There's 40 years of dead fish everywhere and I'm melting, okay? -Just look at this place. There's no smog, no traffic. Come on, don't be angry. -Don't tell me how to feel. I need to be pissed off right now, okay? Uh-oh. -What? -(Judy coughs) -(register dings) -Jude, is there a reason that you didn't just buy a new coffee cup? -I broke the set. It has to match. -Oh, heaven forbid-- unmatched coffee cups. -It has to match. Do you have any idea how much a whole set of coffee cups, not to mention anything with character costs? -Alex: Does it matter? -Ta-da. What do you think? -Nick: It's... it's colorful. -Yes, very colorful. -You don't like it. -Oh, I love it. It's beautiful. Martha Stewart would be proud. -Nick: It's ready. -Judy: It's interesting, Nick. I can see what you're going for. -Jesus, Jude, be honest with him. -Nick: What do you mean? -Nick, that is the ugliest The homeless guy who roots through my garbage would throw it back. It's dark, it's moody. You've no appreciation for art. That's not art, Nick. It's a bruise. -(sighs) Ugh. -(phone beeps) -(beep) -Man on answering machine: Hey, it's me. I was just wondering if you wanted to see a movie. All right. -Mmm. Iced coffee. -(beep) -Bob on answering machine: Judy? It's, um, it's me. It's Bob. Yeah, well, the job's good and, um, well, I was-- I was just thinking, I know we talked about it before, do you wanna get married? To me? Will you marry me? -(gasps) -(shatters) -The ring is coming tomorrow, express mail. If you sign for it, I guess that means yes. I love you. -He proposed to my answering machine. -Alex: Proposed like marriage? -To my answering machine! Give me a cigarette. I didn't have time to stop. -So what about the ring? Is he mailing it? -Overnight express. -Fuck, Jude, I was kidding. -I-- I'm marrying a dork. I mean, he is such a dork. -So what if he's a dork? If you love him, marry him. -I haven't signed for the ring yet. -So, do you want to be Mrs. Dork? -Shut up, Nick. You're so jealous. -What's up with you and those shoes? -What about 'em? -Nick: How many pairs of shoes do you own? -42 at last count. Why? -Normal people don't own 42 pairs of shoes. -I wanna tell you, last month, I was in Barneys, I found this really great pair of black slip-ons, made this incredible sound when you walked on tile. They were sort of post modern, assuming you can do that in a shoe, right? Anyways, I had to have 'em. I laid down the card. 350 right there. -Nick: That's almost my rent. I get it. You're sublimating rejection. -Okay, I'm dating this model, right? And she's a really beautiful girl. She's a really fast and hard girl. -"Fast and hard"? What exactly does that mean? -Are you guys even listening to me? -She was, you know, almost a Guess model. And anyway, she was into all this natural stuff and I didn't really want to look like I was trying too hard, right? So, I go to the Gap, pick up this great denim shirt, I figured it'd go with this beautiful red Armani tie I have. I mean, I look good in red. Anyways, I know I need the shoes to go with it, so I go back, another 300 bucks right there. So, I take her out that night, I give her all the bullshit about the hellish life of a creative exec-- okay, well, junior exec-- okay-- executive assistant. She's a model, what the fuck she know? Anyways, a friend of mine He had one of these $3,000-a-month high rises in Westwood. I nailed her on the first date on a black leather couch looking over the ocean, watching MTV. It was so L.A. I couldn't believe it. -You are such a scumbag, Alex. -No, I'm not a womanizer or anything. It's just that I'm a young guy with a lot to learn. But she didn't see it that way. She told me to... to go fuck myself, but... -(laughs) Yes! -(distant siren) -(helicopter whirring) -(sirens approaching) -(gunshot) -(car alarms blaring) -Judy: Mrs. Judy... Mrs... Mrs... Judy... (sighs) This is not good. -Excuse me. Um, this may sound terribly direct, but I've been staring at you for half an hour, and... I was wondering, would you like to get some dinner with me sometime? -No. Man, he was gorgeous. I mean, he's probably a jerk. Bob, he's really, really sweet. He's a really, really sweet... dork. -(rock music plays) -"This item requires your signature. "After three delivery attempts, the item will be returned to sender." So, all I gotta do is just wait out two more attempts. -Or just sign for the damn thing. -Or just say no. So, what kind of guy do you figure Bob for? Two-month's-salary-upfront or the sales-credit-plan kind of guy? -Don't forget the Cracker-Jack-prize kind of guy. -Oh, what about the candy-pacifier-ring kind of guy? -He'd keep that for himself. -You're right. -Would you guys just leave Bob alone? -No. -Absolutely not. -(Eddie hums) Anything else? -A life for my buddy Nick? -No. -So, what about this guy that asked you out today? -Judy: Nick! -What? Aren't you glad Bob's not around to witness your treachery, you wanton whore? -I'm not gonna go out with him, okay? -Oh, but you wanted to. -I-- -You thought about it. -Yeah. When I met Bob, I was dating somebody else. I was always terrified that, you know, I was gonna miss something, so I took all these chances dating all these losers. Then Bob told me that this one time, I'd be missing the rest of my life. -Ouch! I'm getting a cavity. -We've been together ever since. I knew when I met him that he would never leave. That he was the one. I just... (sighs) -Afraid you're gonna miss something? -(rock music playing) -What are you doing here? -Dodging the mail guy. -Ooh, that's adult. The usual? -Yeah. So you think I'll be making a huge mistake if I marry Bob, don't you? -That stuff's gonna give you a brain tumor. -Great, like one major-league headache isn't enough. -It's on me, by the way. -Thanks. Well, don't you? -Don't I what? -Think I'll be making a huge mistake? -Yes. -Ah, you suck. -Alex: So we go back to her house, right? And, you know, we started to get a little loose, you know, she gets some wine, I get a line, we go back into her room, we start messing around a little bit, we start getting hot and heavy, tits and elbows flying everywhere, and she's only there for two or three seconds, you know, and she comes back, and I'm like, "What the hell were you doing?" And she says, "Well, I was putting in my diaphragm." And-- and, uh... I say, "You don't have a diaphragm." She says, "I know. I borrowed my roommate's." (chortles) What? That's the closest I ever came to being with two women. -(door opens) -Cindy? Did you gt my note about the dishes? -Cindy: Yes, Mom. Thanks. -Cin... would you ever borrow my diaphragm? -You don't use a diaphragm. -But if I did, would you ever borrow it? -Depends on the guy. -Can I take you to dinner maybe? I know the maitre d' at Drai's. I know it's expensive. (snorts) Yeah. Don't worry about it. -Man: Where the fuck is Alex? Copies now.

God. -You take your groceries home in that thing? -Is there anything you don't have in this bag? -Swiss Army knife... -Nick: Jeez, you're ready for anything, eh? -...the tape that you made me, Alka-Seltzer for those nasty hangovers, condoms... -Whoa! "Extra large." Looks like Bob the Dork's got some hidden qualities. -You keep that. You need that more than I do. -Oh, I don't think so. At least not this size. -Oh, come on, Nicky. You're a safety boy, aren't ya? -Yeah, it's just-- it's been a while. The way I see it, there's three types of people out there: those in relationships who are having sex-- though in most two-job couples with one partner out of town, I imagine it's pretty sporadic. -Not with me and Bob. -Whatever. And then there's those people who haven't gotten laid in months who are honest about it. Oh, and then there's that person who hasn't been laid in months who loves to bullshit about all the women he's bagged. -What are you trying to say, Nick? -Nothing. Although, I think all three parties are represented here at the table, and... I can't remember the last time I got laid. -Oh, so that would make me the liar? -He is quick. He's a sharp man. Oh, don't tell me. -I have to have them. -Alex, you don't need another pair of shoes. -I know, but I want them. -Judy: Nick, check out these postcards! My mother's gonna love these! -I guess. Hey, what's with the postcards? Do you ever actually send any to her? -Well, I mean, other than the postcards, you hardly ever talk about her. You wouldn't think you even had a mother. -Yeah, so what? We just have a little problem communicating. -Doesn't listen? -We just don't have much to say. -Mm. -Where are you going? -Oh! "L'Annee Jolie." We gotta go see that film. -You want us to go see a movie called "The Pretty Year"? -Yeah. It's black and white, French subtitles. -Does it have guns? -No. -Is it a love story? I don't want to spoil it for you guys, you know? I mean, we always go to see Alex's shoot-'em-ups and your dippy romances. I mean, come see one of my movies for a change. -Okay. -Worst case, you'll learn something about me. What's up? -No offense, Nick, but remind me to never learn anything about you ever again. -What are you talking about? It was a beautiful love story. -"Love story"? Nicky, everybody died. -It was a tragic love story. It exemplified the pointlessness of existence. -Thank you, but I don't need to be reminded of how pointless my existence is. -Your existence isn't pointless. You've got Bob, the nice dork. -You got us. -(country music playing) -Judy: So why is it exactly is it that you're spending $200 on somebody else's jeans? -'Cause my old ones have so many holes in them, they look like clam-diggers. -Yeah, but why $200? -Put it this way. Would you rather date the Calvin Klein model or the boy next door? -Well, if the boy is nice... -Yeah, but would you want to be seen with that boy? Besides, it's hard to replace an old pair of jeans. You know, I've got memories with jeans. History. One time, I wore a pair of jeans for two weeks straight. -That's longer than most of your relationships. -Exactly. Huh? Huh? Huh? -Oh, man. Next. -What? What do you look for in a pair of jeans? -I don't know, something cheap, comfortable, and doesn't make my ass look too big. -So, you're just looking for an article of clothing? -Yes, Alex. They're jeans. -See, I'm looking for a best friend. You know, something that won't care if I don't do laundry. In fact, that will appreciate the increased comfort that comes from weeks of constant wear. -Uh-huh. Well, you struck out with Cindy Crawford, so why don't you try on this one? -♪ First it looked too worn to play ♪ Mm-hmm. See? Girl next door is not so bad. -Let's see how she is in bed. -(chuckles) -Nick: Alex, you owe me $1,500. -I don't have that kind of money. -Well, you better find it, and I mean quick, 'cause I'm not gonna float you again. All right, give me your railroads. -Is it just me, or does it seem like everybody pushing 40 just had a baby? -There's nothing more boring than listening to people talk about their kids. Listening to people talk about their recovery. Actually, that's not a bad idea. I should go get myself a heroin addiction. Go into treatment. Probably a good way to meet models. -Hm. Hey, what's wrong with kids anyways? I mean, there are no Dork Juniors in your future? -Oh, please. Me? No. I can't be tied down. I want to be able to do what I want to do when I want to do it. -Ha! Yeah. -And, Jude, look in the mirror. You're not exactly spontaneous. -I'm very spontaneous. -(clattering) -Yeah, she's the queen of whimsy. -Yeah, I'm sure there's nothing like a wacky night in front of the TV with you and good ol' Bob. Corporate merger. -What do you mean? Why does she get all that? -Because I want her to beat you, Nick. -You're not leaving. -Yes, I am. -Boy, you're gonna break tradition. -I have a date. -With who? -Would you believe the girl who sold me my car? -(chuckles) What are you guys gonna do? a Blockbuster night. What do you think, "9 1/2 Weeks" or "Showgirls"? -That's like a '90s version of, "You wanna see my etchings?" When was the last time you took a girl home without her taking her clothes off and getting all over you? -I don't own a VCR. -You're pathetic, Nick. Forfeit the condoms. Thank you. Good night. -Good night. -Night. Bye. -So what do you want out of life? -Are you being serious? -Yeah. -I don't know. I used to think I wanted it. -The Diane Sawyer thing. -Yeah, right, but it's a myth, man. She's probably miserable too. -So what do you do? -Well, you can't win and you can't quit. -No, you can quit. It just doesn't look too good on a resume. -(mellow music playing) -(both laugh) -Dude, you suck. -No. Hey, you and Alex, you never, um... you know, like, uh... -Huh? -You guys never-- -Played charades? I'm not following you. What? -You guys never slept together, did you? -No! Well, you know, no. I mean, he put the moves on me, but... -It's Alex. Naturally. -Naturally. No, he's not my type. -Really? So, um, what's your type? Tall, beefy frat boys? Jocks? Everything I'm not? -Oh, please. Yeah, that's why I'm with Bob, the nice dork. You know, I think that there are just couples that are meant to be together and couples that are just stuck together, right? -My parents are like that. I don't think they really love each other. I'm the youngest of eight, and they stayed together for the kids. That's all just bullshit. -Oh. Well, it's either gonna work or it's not, right? -Right. -Wow, eight kids. -I'm really sorry about that. You know, that one must have been over the limit. I'll send you a check or something, you know? -It's okay. It's my treat. -What do you say we get another round? -I think you've had plenty. -Oh, no, just getting started. -What do you say we get some air? -All right. Air is good. -Air is good. Come on, let's go. Oh, my purse. -Do you want to come back to my apartment? Maybe we could watch a movie or something? -(car door opens) -Why didn't you bring your car? -Like I could drive in this condition. -I could drive. -(scoffs) I need the exercise anyways. -Oh, right here on the corner of Crack and Eight-ball, you decide that you need exercise? -Yeah. Maybe a junkie-flunkie or a Hutu rebel will kill me. (chuckles) -That's pessimism for ya. -That's not pessimism. That's wishful thinking. -Ah. Man. Okay, I have a question for you. -Okay. -Okay. What would you do if you were me? -I would dump Bob and marry me. -Come on, Nicky. I'm serious. What's happening? I mean, do I get married? I mean, what if I get married and I miss something? Do I go to school? -Don't worry about it. It's gonna be okay. -Nicky. -Listen.

Give me this. You're drunk. -I'm perfectly sober. Maybe you're drunk. -Maybe I am. -(R&B music playing) -Hold on. Hold on. I'll be right back. -I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. -(scoffs) -(door opens) (door closes) -What the fuck are you doing, Alex? -(music continues) -Shelli... what do you look for in a pair of jeans? -What are you talking about? -I gotta go. -Look, maybe we can do this some other time. We just... can't tonight, okay? -Yeah. Right. What is it, Alex? Is it me? I'm not pretty enough? Get the fuck out. You fucking asshole! -(door opens) -Come back! -(door closes) -How long have we known each other? -I don't know, four years? -Are you sure about this? -Yeah, I'm sure. -God, Nick, stop. Oh, man. Oh, I've done this before. You know, sleeping with a really good friend. -Yeah? -Yeah, well, it just fucks things up, you know? I mean, it just-- it's just really weird, and you can never go back to just being friends. -I don't want to just be friends. -Look... I've ruined really good friendships this way, and I don't want it to happen to us. -Oh, God. -I just want to be sure. -You know, I've been trying to talk myself out of this for a really long time, telling myself that it couldn't work. And then I get these bursts of optimism, like this could be the one thing in my life that could work. The thing is, I'm in love with you. -Oh, Nick. -What? I'm tired of dancing around, flirting with you. I don't want you to go to Idaho. -Nick-- -I want you to stay here with me. -Stop. -I'm not gonna stop. I'm not gonna stop. I love you. Doesn't that mean anything? -I'm not in love with you. I mean, I love you, but I'm not in love with you. -You're not in love with Bob either. Just look me in the eye. Tell me you're in love with Bob and I'll stop. -I can't think anymore. -You don't have to. -Do you have anything? -Yeah, USDA choice and a note from my doctor. -You know what I mean. -Oh, oh, oh. -Oh, fuck. Alex. Tell me you have condoms. -Uh... yes. Um, middle drawer in the bedroom. Jewelry box, jewelry box. -I will be right back. -Okay. (sighs) Oh god. -(phone ringing) (ringing continues) -(beep) -Hello? -Bob: Hi! -Hi, honey. -Did you get it? -Get what? Oh, yeah, the m-- Ah, no, I missed the mail guy and I-- I think he's gonna come again on-- on Monday. -Judy, what the hell is going on? -What do you mean? Nothing. -Then why are you doing this? -Doing what? I'm not doing anything. -I can't believe you didn't sign for the ring. -I can't believe you proposed to me on the phone. -Judy, you know I couldn't get away, okay? You always said I should figure out what I wanted and I figured it out. I want you. I love you, Judy. I'm sorry I proposed on your machine, but I had to say it. I-- I didn't want to wait. -Bob... this is not a good time. -When is? -I-- I can't do this right now. -Just tell me this-- is it Alex or Nick? -Fuck you, Bob. -(beep) (sighs) -(lighter clatters) -Um, about last night... -Listen, I was drunk, okay? -Don't do that. -I don't know what I'm supposed to say. -You don't have to say anything. Jesus, it's not like I haven't thought about it. -Like last night? -Yeah, like last night. -So, I'm off the hook? -Yeah, you're off the hook. -(upbeat music playing) -What's up? -Come on. -What? -I thought you get off at 3:00. -Yeah, I do, but I got-- -So, come on. I got something to show you. -Okay. Belinda, taking off. That makeup's totally you. -I don't mean to be direct, but... I've been watching you for over half an hour and... -Well, what about my car? -Get it later. Any word on the ring? -Yeah. They're gonna try delivering it again tomorrow. -You gonna sign for it or send it back? -(sighs) Alex, how do you know if you're really in love or if you just think you're in love? -(sighs) What's the difference? -(cars honking) -This way. -Are we allowed to be in here? -It's a church. -Can I smoke in here? -It's a church. -(laughs) -Jeez. -In here? -Yes. -Where are we going? -Just keep climbing. -Oh, shit. You didn't go do something cheesy like-- like cater a lunch up here or something, did you? -No. That would have been a good idea, though. Keep going. Close your eyes. -No! -Okay, come on, close your eyes. -What if I lose my balance and fall? -I will catch you. -(laughs) I was never very good at that game. -Me either. I'd be scared if I were you. Up, up, up. Keep going. (speaking indistinctly) -(laughs) -Okay. -Wow. I didn't know you were religious. -I'm not really. I was just walking by this place one day and I stuck my head in here. I thought it was pretty cool. I wanted to show somebody. -Mm. -And girls I date wouldn't get it. -It's beautiful. Alex, what am I gonna do? -I'm probably not the best person to ask about that. Relationships aren't exactly my strong point. -All right. I just don't know if I love him. I don't know if I'm in love with him. Bob. I don't know if I'm in love with Bob. -I don't know if I've ever really been in love, you know? I suppose I thought I was at one point. But you get so sucked up into these relationship things, you get like, tunnel vision, you know? And then you lose track of what's really going on. I thought I was in love with this girl, but it turned that she was... seeing somebody else and lying to me about it, so we broke up. The funny thing is, I thought I'd be really heartbroken, and I got drunk. By the time my hangover was gone, I was over her. -(both chuckle) -I realized she was just this other girl You know, I made it out to be... something in my head that it wasn't, you know? -Yeah. God, why didn't I just sign for the ring? And why am I not out there looking for China patterns right now? Oh, man. I can't take it. I think-- I think I obsess too much. You know, I mean, I get all analytical about love, and-- and love's an emotion and there's no logic behind emotion. You can't just-- you-- I can't-- I think I'm just analyzing myself out of love. -Judy, Judy, come back with to us, babe. Please. -I know. Why am I acting like this? Ugh. Yuck. -You're scared. Shitless. I figure by the time we're in our mid-20s, we're just all damaged goods. There's just some people you can't turn in for the refund. -Oh, perfect. -(rock music playing) -Hey, Eddie. -♪ Don't miss out ♪ ♪ On the other things that you love ♪ -Uh... -Let's just use this one. Nick, come on. -That's our booth. -Yeah, so what? Give me a fanny. -Don't worry about it. Do you ever wonder what happened to the guys from "The Breakfast Club"? No, I mean, what do you think they're doing 10 years after high school? Digging ditches? Working the streets? -Reality check here, Nick. Those guys are actors in movies. -I know that. You're missing my point. -Oh, God. -What? -My 10-year reunion is coming up. I look old. -You don't look old. Big deal anyways. I figure it's all just one big show. You know, see who made it and who didn't, brag about your accomplishments. The only thing I've accomplished is an artful mastery of the subtle differences between regular and decaf. -(industrial music playing) -(elevator dings) -(phone ringing) -(chuckles) (snickers) -Alex: What are you looking at? You think it's funny? Huh? Huh? Come on! Come on! Huh? Do ya? -(people chattering) -(footsteps approaching) -Can I ask you a question? -Anything. -Are you happy? -What kind of question is that, Eddie? I drive a BMW. Of course I'm happy. -I don't give a shit about your car, man. You just don't seem happy, that's all. I mean, you date a different girl every week and I see you in here talking smack all the time. You don't think Nick and Judy buy any of that bullshit, do you? -I don't know. -You don't? 'Cause I don't, and I'm pretty much an amateur. -What are you trying to say, Eddie? -I see how you're living, my friend. And I say the dream you're clinging to is pretty much kicking your arse. Just think about it. One day you'll kick off and have nothing to show for it but a bad credit rating. -But I'll look good. -♪ He two-timed the moments ♪ ♪ And it tethered you ♪ -Hey, baby. -♪ Made you think twice on what you love ♪ -I got sacked. -Alex. -Don't ask. -What'd you do? -A lot of shit... just piled up. Went in this morning and found a pink slip on my desk. -Oh, man. -That's not even the best part. -There's more? -I figured I was due for some shoes, so I went shopping... and the Nazi behind the counter wouldn't take my gold card. Fucker actually cut it up right there in front of my face. I'm unemployed and totally broke. -You can't be that much in debt. -Mm-mm. -Not on one card. I put my car on my AMEX, and I'm paying it off with my Visa and my Mastercard, so if you count those, they're both, what, about seven each? Figure if you add in department store cards, gas card, student loan... probably 40 or 50 thou'. -40 or $50,000? -I can't believe you. -I'm pretty appalling, huh? -Judy: It's not funny, Alex. -They need anybody at the coffee shop, Nick? -No. What about your car? -I don't know. I figure if I move into a smaller place and get a different job, I can probably swing that. How are your tips? -They suck. Move where? -I don't know. -There's always your mom and step-dad. -Yeah. Yeah, I can just imagine Marsha and Dave's reaction whenever I'm living at their house up to my ass in debt and driving a $40,000 car. -How the hell did you ever get that car anyways? -I lied, Nick. It's the American way. -It had to happen sometime. -Alex: Did it? -Mm-hmm. -Look, I know. I know. -I could never move in back with my mom. -That reminds me, did you ever send any of those postcards? -No, I didn't have any stamps. -Please. -I never knew what to say.

It's finished. -What? -I was at the bookstore the other day and I found my book. Same premise, same story, same everything. I even finished writing it. Just too late. -You can't sue this guy? -What guy? -The guy that stole your book. -He didn't steal it. He just got there first. There's nothing illegal about coming up with the same premise or the same... Fuck it. I don't care! I don't care! -Why are you acting like you don't give a shit when you know damn well-- -Because I don't. I mean, you just don't get it. You never understand me. -Oh, right. No, no, tell me. I really wanna know. -You wanna know? Look, 'cause it's not cool, all right? Everybody's trying so fucking hard to be cool, you know, and I don't fit in. I feel like I'm like, out of the 19th century or something. You know what I hate? I just-- I hate the fact that you can't talk about anything that really matters without being ridiculed. What if somebody said that their soul is dying? People would just roll their eyes and say, "What a fucking pretentious freak." Like now. What if somebody's soul really was dying? You know, that feeling? That feeling like everything in the world is just sucking the life out of you? How else do you say it? Your soul is going dead. But don't say that. No, 'cause you gotta be cool. Right, Alex? Look at you. Spend all your time and your money trying to look cool. You don't have a pot to piss in. It's like the goal is not to be touched by anything. Not to care about anything, you know? Try to pretend that there's nothing out there that can really fuck you up. It's like everybody else is trying to turn things that matter into something to sell. Anybody that ever thinks about writing a novel, you know, they always think that their novel is gonna be the next great American novel, and they're gonna be the next great American writer. Well... not everybody can pull it off. I mean, what if Warhol's right? We all get 15 minutes of the big time, you know? There's a fuck of a lot of people out there. I could be 80 before my number's up. I mean, that's a long time to work nine to five. What do you do? -Well, could always wallow in self-pity for years, talking about what a great writer you are, or you could write another book. -I think I'll try wallowing in self-pity for a few years. -No one's gonna hand you anything, Nick. -Just so you know, you sound more like my mother every day. What's wrong with you? I mean, you're like, totally different all of a sudden. -Okay. My turn. -Alex: Holy shit. -I signed for the ring. -Oh, oh. -So, you went for the house, the car, and the white picket fence? -Uh, I-- I wouldn't exactly go that far. I'm just trying to deal with the whole marriage thing. -What about law school? -I don't want to go back to school. I really don't. I am so tired of hiding from everything. I'm not scared anymore. I wanna try. It is important for me to try. -Send us a postcard. -(chuckles) -(country music playing) -Thank you. -Thanks for the couch. -Ah, thank you for helping me. -Hey, no problem. -So you gonna be okay? -Nope. But I'll deal with it. I'm not gonna stop being in love with you. -Last chance. Wanna marry me? -(laughs) -Kay, how 'bout a cigarette? -(laughs) You don't smoke. You haven't smoked if five months. -That's right, and I feel great. I feel really good about not smoking now.

Honey, the meatloaf is on fire! -I mean, I don't know if this is the right thing for me, you know, but I do know that marriage isn't for everybody and there are no guarantees.
