AN UNFORGETTABLE CHRISTMAS I know that most people decorate tombs on the Day of the Dead, but... my mother loved Christmas. Therefore, independently of the weather, every Christmas, I go to cemetery to decorate his grave. Can people freeze if they stay here? -You're not from around here? -I left a long time ago Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! If you believe, small miracles can change your life. A child who laughs, the car that needs a repair, even a pair of shoes. Nor did I know that I needed a miracle, until it happened. It was about fifteen years ago What have I done to deserve a beautiful girl? She is amazing, fifty times more intelligent than me. Talented, clean your room. It is excellent in the School. So maybe you will not go to my concert tonight? - This time I will go. - Maybe I should not go. -What are you talking about? -I feel a little dizzy. You are very well, sleep a little more. Dad, when you come tonight, bring me flowers. You can bet. -Robert, do you want to drink your coffee? -No, I'm late. - Hey, guess what. -What? Remember that Victorian mansion? The mansion you were drooling for having? - As I remember you were the one who drooled! -On sale. - It's a great commitment! - Let's fly higher - You're coming tonight, right? - Everyone puts me to the test today! Buy some roses and please do not be late. I have clients from the agricultural sector who are trying to keep the tubes of irrigation. It's one thing, I'm leaving the job now. You talked to the farmers. true? Everyone in the company is involved. Tom prepares documents, Noggets He does not stop talking with men on his tractors like removers through his short nose. They are experienced partners, they always get what they want. I am better at what I do. And I work hard. Gwen prepared this curriculum for you. We need you again to teach a course on Madson Hill. I think Lilly is used to staying at home? Yes! But we agreed to do it... I think we talk about it. - See you at night. - Very good Is not my style! I caught her - Run Run! - Have you heard, come on! All right, I'm ready. Come on, strip I am so sorry! You hit my antenna, did not you see me before throwing the ball? I was just trying to teach my son how to throw Think it is so. Whatever.

Well, check out the classifieds! - Here it is. - Bom! - Not yet. Let me see. If you get a job as a cook you will be rich. Thank you! Here, mom, I found it, I found it! We are not going to have puppies. No way! Honey, you have more butter? Why not! You did not have a dog as a child? - That's a good argument! - Help. I'll take care of him. No, we do not have much money. - It's the last thing we need. - I need a puppy. - Why can not I have a puppy? - Why? Wait a minute! I do not know dear! Well, remember my friend's goldfish? Two weeks ago they are floating around the belly. I did not want to bury him. Have you finished all your homework? - The majority? - The teacher taught them to only do the majority? - Yes! - Yes, go to school! This sucks! - Do not you want to talk about the dog at least? - Oh, dear, it's so irresponsible. - It's just a boy. - Children have to be responsible. Your mother says that the dog was exactly the cure for you irresponsibility, okay? -My mother said that? -Yes. - Any news from the doctor? - Nothing new. So... respect? Regarding what? To the puppies? This is a dirty trick. - It was not. - It's not fun -We'll talk later! -Bye I love you! Andrews Mechanics Workshop - Hi boss. - How are you, Carl. I was thinking about placing a cappuccino machine, maybe that will attract more customers Maybe that will help! Carl, do you know what a cappuccino is? An Italian sports car. We have Italian sports cars around here, they're a lot of old cans. Let's go to work! A pair of magic shoes! All night the girl put on her special shoes and ran through the woods... He danced, as if by magic, the entire night. When he woke up at dawn, the shoes were gone. and she still could not walk. Nathan! Come here! -Because you do not finish the story. -Agree. Finally, one day the girl woke up and told her dream to her mother. Lying on the bed and motionless, he said: I do not want to have more dreams Why? Asked his mother. Well, I'm tired of dancing alone, said the girl. But you never danced alone, said her mother. You were dancing with the angels. I am sorry! I wore a pair of shoes just like this one. It, it seems dramatic, but I had never started dancing, and it was wonderful... Well, someone got excited about the story. Besides Mrs. Andrews? Noooo! Do not forget to finish the art project! And please do not forget the concert tonight! The choir members remember to arrive half an hour early. Thank you! Hey you know. You have to finish your studies, You could have a good job here, Maggie. No, I like to do it voluntarily. Especially the music. Yes, but think about the pay. Well, I do not see myself going back to studios now. Maybe in a few years... - You would enter my place! - You say the same thing every year Next year I'll be in Florida! -What are you going to do there? -To have peace and quiet I'll leave the problems to you. How many farmers involved so far? So far we have twenty-eight, more... - It bends but we're going to have to sweat the shirt. - I have a list of names. I need all the necessary hydrology documentation of the area that you made, they have water rights, until the end of the 19th century. - All. - It is done! I need a study of flora and fauna, everything that lives: fish, plants. All The lady who paid the taxes checks my folder. We still need your signature and comments from Boswell Pharmaceutical They confirmed the interview that was requested with his wife. Excellent! Robert! I received a call from John Cardwell, we have the case of a complicated farm, in your hands. Yes, I do not blame them. If you can testify on your way There will be a farm left in the city. - And when will he testify? - Morning. This case is getting too long. You should have anticipated it before, not letting things go forward. It's going to be OK! Excuse me, Mrs. Andrews What's up, Lily? My nose is blocked and my throat hurts. I guess I will not sing tonight. Let see your language. Well, do you know what I think you have? Anxiety, I'm the same too. You know, after you start singing, it will disappear. I promise We are going to be ready. I will see you later! Hi, I do not think we've met before, I'm Lily's mother I'm Maggie Andrews, it's a pleasure. Pleasure in knowing her too. Lily is just adorable. -Where did you get that voice from? -I assure you not of me. - Can I help with these chairs? - I would like to, thank you! I studied music for some time, but... -You studied music? -Yes. Until I found my husband, he went to law school and... We had a mountain of accounts to pay and the music did not seem to be very practical... Then, I went to study administration. - When was your son born had to stop working? - Something like that. -And you? -I am also a teacher... in my dreams. -Your husband must be very proud of Lily? -It is. He is here? Is coming. How are you, Kate? -Good and you? - Robert is here? -You know your son. - How are you, Dalton? - Well well. Thank you! Do not you think I should wear a tie? Come on! You know I hate ties You will be great! Oh, dear, I'm sorry I created a fool for a son. It's not his fault, he can not stop working. Like his father! Mom! -Good luck, mom. -I love you. -Thank you! -I love you so much. Do not fall behind! My Lord, let me do this work. Thank you! Thank you, Thank you all for being here. My name is Maggie Andrews, and I'm the director of the Choir We have a great show tonight, your children are great. They worked a lot! And for this reason, I have great news: The city has chosen its children to sing during the illumination of the Christmas tree in the Plaza de la Ciudad. The rehearsals will start next holiday and it is better to be prepared! OK, let's start. To kick off tonight, we have a wonderful young singer. Miss Lilly Layton. Watch out! Dalton, I still think you're driving too fast. Silly stuff! -And you should wear a tie. -I never liked wearing ties. He is very kind to bring me here. I really live next door, so... - Would you accept a tea? - No no. I have to go. Oh, Dalton, you can stay, I insist! I want to talk about tonight. I have to order a table full of papers waiting for me. Anyway, thank you! -Hey, Robert! -Hi! How are you? Dalton, who is this stranger in my house? Do not wait, do not tell me. Oh yes, my son, the lawyer! - Why do not they put the correct name? - The price of the company! A hundred dollars per hour. Dalton, a mother should not be on her son's side, right? Mothers love their children, good or bad. There is a big difference. - I need you to sign this. - What is it. Revised taxes. - Work work work. He can not wait? - Mom, hurry! Dalton, do not tell me you're tired it will be when you reach my age. - Listen to your mother. Goodnight! - Goodbye! Sign it! Put it in your mailbox! - I'm going! - Robert, do not just think about work! I already heard you! - Remember! - I'm listening! Kate! I'm sorry, I had a lot of cases to review for tomorrow. And you had to be until 08:30 PM? You never had cases where you stayed until 08:30 at night All this because I did not want to go to a concert. I had 10 thousand phone calls! Desktop routines And then someone leaves for some reason. It seems to have no life. I know you, Robert. And I know that you are capable of doing anything, even when you can not. It's Lily who worries me. She is awake? Yes! Hello! I will not talk to you I'm in the middle of the Show. You should not have a television in your room -Who is that device? -Of yours. I assure you it is the best for you How was it? I was pretty good -The people asked me for BIS, daddy -I bet that yes. You really would have liked the Show But, Daddy... I wanted you to be there Next time I will go. I promise. I know you're tired of hearing the same thing, but I did not have to be there to feel proud of you Kate! Is not it wonderful? We are all proud of Lily Layton. How beautiful the future awaits you. Doctor Mather, come in! Excuse me, it's too late. Did not know that the doctors made visits? Well, there are exceptions. Please sit down! Maggie, the exam results came. And they are not good. Your heart is not pumping correctly. That's why he has difficulty breathing. You have an incongruent failure in the heart. But how... We thought it was because of the flu. It is an inflammation of the myocardium. It has the same symptoms, but... it's not the flu. I would have liked it to be so... I really would have loved We think it may be caused by a virus. What does it mean? It means that Maggie's heart muscle cells are being destroyed. And this is getting worse. And now, what are we going to do? There is nothing more that can be done, I want to send you to Boston, for more tests. I can not do this! Do you need the instruments to sing? This looks good! Maybe I'll take one or two for Maggie. You know how much he loves Chocolate. I also like Maggie, I wish I had met her before. I would have liked to help her with the whole concert. I'm feeling aromas, I'll have to see where they come from So this is what was driving me crazy while shaving. - Do not! - I think you should return this to the store. -Just one? -Dad! Dad, no! I see that they are not for me. They are for the choir! And, you'll go to the Christmas Concert, right? If there is a DAY in the year, what can you count on me is Christmas. And happily, without a shadow of a doubt, it will be the last Christmas in this house Next year we will be in Madison Hill. Why Madison Hill? I do not want to live there. You will love it, you will have a large room. You have an interview with Boswell Pharmaceutical at 10 o'clock in the morning Interview for what? For a new job for mom. I do not think Robert, I thought we would talk about it. - Talk? - Forget this! I'm going to do the interview. - I worked hard for this. - Very good, good. Case closed, I will. It is true! Lily! If you are going to get that job ... I think I will not see you either. I called the parents so they did not send me email after I left. Doctors say I have to go to a Heart Hospital -You'll need a transplant? -They say it's the only thing they can do The good news is that they are determined to make me live. When they call, we have to go to Boston as fast as possible we have to carry these Beeper Jack has one too. If you need... of anything, if I can help in any way. Well, I was thinking, if you get a call from school, maybe you could... take care of Nathan, we'll hire an assistant to be with him while we are in Boston. No, it will not be necessary, Nathan can stay with me until they return -Insurance? -Absolutely. I have excellent neighbors who like children who visit them and drink chocolate... ..if Nathan stays with me, rest assured that he will do his homework -Everything is set. -Thank you Oh, Lily! Hello everyone! All right, everyone, let's get ready. Well, everyone open their singing books. We are going to work in groups. You left it on the kitchen table. Maggie, is everything okay? Do you want me to call a doctor? I can not do this, I have no strength. -Kate, can you do me a favor? -Insurance! -Continue the class. -You mean now? No, I mean the Christmas Program. Oh, Maggie, I can not... I do not have experience... -But you studied music. -Yes, but it was a long time ago... ... I can not, I'm not capable. But you have the heart. It's just a joke. Is that... I have something today. I do not get! These children! Where are the other Lily? Oh! I know where they are, I can in a second Are here! I think dad has gone crazy. Fill out the form. Why? do not! Oh! Who does this here, your father had to return it. It is better to go up to your room. What's happening, Kate? You lost your interview. Something came up at school -What are you talking about. -I'm going to do the Christmas Program. This is not happening, you did not leave everything. Did you change the interview for a Christmas program at school? This is a joke! -Maggie, be sick. Maggie? The music teacher, Robert. From the choir. Have an Aspirin, that's not your problem. She is waiting for a heart transplant... a heart transplant. Something that you could consider. You have the opportunity to get a great job. ..in which anyone would do everything to get it, and you do not want it? By the way, because the School does not place a substitute. Are not taxes for that? It is a voluntary work. If Maggie does not... ... I did it, there would be no Choir, and without Chorus, our daughter .. ..and the rest of the children, they would not have experience singing for one .. community. And I do not know why I'm giving you explanations. I think there must be another volunteer. There must be someone responsible. Is that witchcraft? Because you? And, why not me, Robert? why? This is important for me, maybe it's something that will make me feel good. Look, I know this can interfere with your plans to make money, but what is best for you. It's not about me, it's about the family. -Then, they are your dreams, you want me to follow you. -You know what my dreams are? My dreams are... I'll tell you: I'd like to go to Dean's desk and .. tell him to deliver the cases to someone else. But I'm not telling you, you know why? because I have a family to support. -I feel we are a burden! - Oh please. I just want to say that. What I want to say is: You do not know what my dreams are. Robert, that's a problem... for us two! Nathan Andrews, what's happening? Your heart... ... I wanted to know if it was still beating. This will not work, this will not work! I said, this would not work. Sorry! -Works at Wilson's. -Better, I'm the owner, Tom Wilson. This fell out of a delivery truck, I tried to return it but it was closed. I called, but a young man said he was not there. OK, most people travel in this era It seems that the shipping in our. - It's not exactly your style, but I'll try. - Very good. Thank you! I'll call a crane for you. No, I'll take it to the one who sold it to me. No, no, trust me, I know a man, honest, decent and knows about cars - I mean, it does not turn on. You will save time. - Very well thanks. Well, I'll give you a test, but... It's probably electric. Well, I want it as quickly as possible. -I will do what i can. -All right. Oh, please, put a blanket over him tonight, okay? All right. That guy, he looks like he drinks cappuccino. I have to go. Well, you have something for me, boy. What do you say if we have an ice cream? No thanks. Insurance? Have you met someone who likes to hide? Do not! I bet you're hungry, let's get out of here! Please, can I have your attention, children? Attention please! Class! Hello everyone. I'm Kate Layton, Lily's mom. I'm here to replace Mrs. Andrews while she's... Well, listen, I'll need your... help, I've never done this before, but Ms. Andrews says that you are the most, and I know that it is true because I was in all the concerts Including when Troy vomited in the box. This upcoming Christmas concert will be great! Mrs. Andrews is counting on you and we will not disappoint her, right? -True! -As? -True! -Sorry? -True! -True! Okay, so let's go to page 33 of the book. Dr. Lawrence, call 76. Dr. Lawrence, room 76, please. -What fast! -We do it as quickly as possible. Better put the seat belt. -Doctor, who is the donor? -A teenager. Your poor mother. I will leave as soon as I finish. -Curtain lights. -You like them, do you? Mrs. Layton takes Christmas seriously. It took a week to prepare these things Here, come! -Hello Ellen! -Dalton! -This is Nathan! -Good good good... - Hello! - Will stay with me this night. Maybe a couple of nights. I knew you would come. Come with me, I want to show you something. Here it is! - He has all the things that the Red Sox. - My son! -A long time ago. - He must have been good. It was, everything I did was practice and practice... He had to be the best. -What is your favorite team? -Oh The Red Sox. Oh, this is not good. Maybe you like this. I'm sure it will work for you. -Robert will not even know that I'll give it to you. -Thank you What is that? Robert's lunch box. Well, Cool! Cool! Dear Robert, I was remembering when you were a child Jack and if the procedure did not work? I do not know. The news is not good. We had problems with the donor's heart It was perfect for your blood type. But he was infected with type B hepatitis. I am so sorry! And what do we do now? I mean, there must be something I can do. Maybe there is another donor, there is always an opportunity, right? As Maggie's immune system is failing, and her blood type is hard to find, the odds are... just for a miracle! Jack, we must go home. I'm not going to stay in a hospital. I want to make an offer for that house. I thought you said you could not pay it. The Christmas program will end in a couple of weeks, I will continue after that. I do not know after that. Kate! What are you trying to do What is happening? I like the School project, I like to work with young people. Maybe I want to teach. - Go back to school. - My teaching title is fine. -When did this start? -Robert, I'm trying to talk to you for months. You are never here, the same as when you are, it seems like I can not get your attention I was just trying to make a living, Kate. What kind of support is that, Robert? And at what price? We were two people who shared the same house. and sometimes, the same bed. There are no more options. I guess you do not want me to make a new offer. Think about it a little! Everything is alright? If it is! Oh, Kate! Hi, Maggie, I did not know if it was all right, maybe it would be better to come back later. Nonsense, sit down! -I will prepare lunch! -Thank you! I was dying to chat together about Christmas music. -How have the boys behaved? -Excellent. I need your advice, Maggie. I thought, instead of singing on the Christmas tree, maybe, singing in the streets. -Resolved, I love it. -Really? If you could go from house to house. Well, Pierdy complains that almost 90 percent of the fish die at 81, 82 and 83. Well, those claims are incredible, ninety percent? The highest water levels were ten years ago, then no. We are receiving more people - Gwen? - I'm trying. Try again. And what about the Woodshole expert? It is available, but it was never used as an expert. Well if you wait a little longer, you'll have the biologist who .. He talked with David about the Stanley case. I can not use that type. get to the Woodshole, he is the man. Pierdy complains that the farmers... ... they consume a lot of water, they will testify that the fish die When the level of the lakes is higher, it will kill him, Gwen bring them together. - Mr. Layton? -Yes! - Rivercity real estate on line two, and this was sent by his mother - Thank you! -Hello Jeanny. - Mr. Layton, I was calling you I had a long day... It's about the Madison Hill house, I'm sorry to inform you that there was another offer. What do you mean, with another offer? -Someone gave another higher offer. -And they accepted? I think so! You promised me that I would be the first to know. I'm very sorry, Mr. Layton, but I could not find it. -All right, if this offer fails, let me know. -I will do so. No salt is tasty! -You're good? -I'm fine, go to work Wherever you go, just in case. go away! go away! Bye! bye! I do not remember when it was the last time I saw my husband for lunch, dinner or... ... at the school parent meeting. I know we live in the same house because we have to brush our teeth in the morning. and toothpaste mixed in the middle. You know what I think, I think they are getting slower and slower. How long are you going to hide that? I do not know if I can do more of that, Maggie. How long are you married? -Not enough. -Oh, Maggie, I'm so sorry. Is nothing. The problem with Jack... ... he is not ready for what is going to happen. Not a little prepared And Nathan! I do not want to leave them Kate, I do not want to leave them like that. I am sorry! If you need help with the lesson at home let me know, okay? Sometimes I'm afraid to go home... and not find my mom. It's hard to imagine, but Jack and I met in one of those dance studio classrooms Jack, and you, kid! -Nathan? -Yes! -How is school going? - A nuisance! Great. Well, anyway, since I was a girl I loved dancing, but not Jack. - His mother made him take dance lessons. - Poor Jack! - I think she thought about giving him a little pose. - Or help with the girls. -Exactly, it helped me. -And you him. So every year on our anniversary, we get dressed and go dancing. It is very romantic! I used to have that pair of dance shoes... I do not know what happened to them... every time I put them on, I just felt so... ...special. Those few hours once a year... ... they were magical. Jack, I hated to dance, but I did it for me. How good! It was not bad either, with each of his hands. Hey, take care little man! Attention to all visitors, there is a special discount on the sale of men's clothing. Attention to all visitors, there is a special discount on the sale of men's clothing. Perfect $ 19.99- Pa .. I need to work! I need a job now, please! Well dad, it's very important! It is very very important! A job, what are you talking about, why are not you home? Hey Boss, the capuchin man wants to talk to you! -All right! -I need to earn some money. Please daddy! Nathan, I'm not going to want puppies, okay? Do you understand ?, without puppies But dad, it's not about puppies. You have my car since last week .. and .. What accounts are these? When Jack Andrews takes an expensive car, sir... Money is like tin, when you get to like it, it ends. You see, 5 cents is 5 cents. You give me that can, dad! You did not do well on your last math test, little man! I know! -You can do much better. - Hey, look at that! -This is great! -Great! It's an empty, dirty can, what are you talking about? It's worth 5 cents. If I get twenty I'll have a dollar, and I'll pick up a lot more. I'll make more money and I can buy a special gift for my mom at Christmas. Well enter the car. Good idea! Hello, Jake Mr. Layton, Ronald came. Nobody else. When I heard that he was coming, some others waited to see him. I know how important water is for you. That's it! Well, I brought a camera, show me the home of the famous remora. Not all developers, or Pierdy environmental groups have achieved it. Are we going to lose our farms, Mr. Layton? Many of us here, we have our roots for more than one hundred years on this earth None of that would make a difference for a judge. Why are they behind people like us? Because of fish that nobody wants to fish and nobody wants to eat? PIERDY companies like it. They take advantage of the environment, they do not care about the fish They want their lands. They cut the water, they lower the prices they buy cheap and .. It is then that they sell for a much higher price I think it's the fish that are hurting us. My grandfather was a farmer during the Great Depression... ... the bank took away his land. I do not know if we will achieve it... ... but let's fight. I will talk to all the experts personally. whatever the argument they have to block irrigation. Well, if we do not win, we will not be together next year Thank you! Thank you! Nathan, come here! Nathan! Nathan! Why are not you answering me? I wanted to surprise Mom with those lights. Mom has to rest, without surprises. The dinner is ready Nathan! Thanks for the lights, they are beautiful! You're welcome! Your mom is right, the lights are great son. I think I'm going to get it, like that, ah? Honey, talk to Nathan tonight. -Canta! -Don't sing this song! Daddy! Hello, Robert! -We already took the dinner. I'm sorry, I'm late because of some clients. We thought you would not come. Well, sometimes I am surprised by myself. We knew you would come, we are going to prepare something for dinner. Robert! Sit down! It smells good, everything smells good! This is the test of the pink tray. This pink tray is the improvement you have made. Robert, I'm not blind and I'm not stupid! Something is wrong between you and Kate. You're right. You know, people actually go through things that are very... ... more complicated! It's when you put your marriage in play. And what are these things: power, prestige, taking the account to see who is the first of the company. I still remember your feet after you got out of the crib. And sometimes I remember... ... the smell of grass, after cutting it. Sixth grade... Oh, the man who became, when he brought me the report card. All outstanding. ... and your first deadly game. Rivercity against the Redsox. Oh, and when I saw the tears in your eyes when they lost the game. Thinking you disappointed the team. Common things, Robert. Simple things, from day to day. Your father failed, in many of those things .. ... he never shared these memories. At the end... ... And in the end I think that you would like to share them too They arrived separately, they will split apart. They do not realize how much they love each other. Sometimes the darkest things are for some reason. -Good evening, Dalton! -Goodnight! What things in the world, are you doing with all those cans? What's wrong with trying to make a better world for someone. Are you okay, do you look tired? I'm fine, just worried. Safe? Yes! Do you want me to help you turn off all the lights? No, I'm going to leave them like that, I'm going to sit a little. -Good, goodnight! -Goodnight! Is beautiful! Your design is so smart. I would like to put angels in the front, mom. I love the Angels. Soon I will see a lot of Angels. you will do it? Yes! In the sky. Why does God have to take you to heaven? I do not have all the answers Nathan? But... ... It's not like, that He takes me... ..but it's ok that He is receiving me in Heaven -Exist animals in Heaven? - I bet they have many animals. -Children? -Principally puppies. Call me mom, I told dad... he would not want to be taken to heaven! No, he understands. Let me know if he changes his mind. You know... .. Can you be somewhat angry with me sometimes, because I have to go, but I want you to know that everything is fine. But remember always... ... that you are my greatest joy. And I love you very much. Will the grandfather see? He will meet me at the door. Tell him one thing for me? Insurance! When I was alone, I found a dollar in his dressing room... and I took it! And I ended up spending it. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry. I will tell that to him. Do not go mom! I do not want you to leave, I need you. I just have to go, dear. I have to... Take me with you. No, you need to stay here with your daddy! Nobody is going to take you out now that you have to take care of him. Agree. Nathan. Even if mom has to leave... you will always know where mom is. ..here! you promise me? I promise. Do you know mommy? Every time I feel my heart beating I will remember You Thank you! Oh God! Ellen! The lights left out here. Ellen! You left all the lights on outside. It's going to cost you a small fortune! Ellen! Oh no! We had little time. It was very fast. She continues to live inside of us, Robert. Feel free to call, no matter the time. Agree? Do not delay, Jack. I appreciate everything. Daddy! -Where are you going? -I'm going out. -With Dalton-True? - Well, I think I'll have to see... - I'm going to buy cereals. I'm going to buy lunch, I'm going to do a little .. Tuna sandwich. Dalton will arrive at any time. - Surely you do not want to stay? - It's Christmas Eve, Dad. I have something important to do. Agree. Do not be late! Yes I know! - I brought this lunch! - Oh thanks Let's go downtown! This is the center of the river street. You can find something here. It's one of the most beautiful Christmas trees I've seen, what do you think? -Get one! -Excellent. Remember when I told you that .. I had never lost anyone close to me? Yes! Well, I lied! My wife died eleven years ago, shortly before moving here. Why did he lie? Because it was painful to talk about it. And why do you talk about it now? -Why... ...
