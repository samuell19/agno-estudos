Will you sit on my lap? I said that... if everything goes like it's been going, the designs we just submitted will be handed back to us and they're gonna want changes again and then the things they just asked for in the previous round, they're gonna ask to change, they're gonna ask for new things and we're gonna address those changes and then they're probably gonna say that they don't like that either... Okay - I gotta go and do... - Okay well what does that mean though? Like, I don't... I don't know, I just feel like... Every time that this happens, there's a new reason why it has to be pushed longer and it's like really not, I don't know, I feel like you can never give me like an actual answer of how long your trips are gonna be. It's not excuses, it's just what it is. I can't change that. I should probably go. Look, I'll, it's not like I just walk up to him and be like, hey, my wife wants to know when I'm coming home. Can you give me a sense of when you're gonna approve our plans? I mean, that would be great. Yeah. Then I'd have to look for a new job. I should go. I'm already running late. But I'll Skype you later, okay? Okay, I mean, okay. And if there's anything... Bye, Jessie! Bye! Bye. Let's go up! Jessie? Do you think I'm a good mummy? Yeah. Jessie? Baby doll, baby clothes.

Just make sure she doesn't... I'm so hungry. When is this food coming? It's coming, Mum. I say that to him all the time. Hey. I have a joke. I have a joke, there's a, we have a family tradition where I tell jokes, and on this particular day I have a very special joke about family. Come here, come sit down. Go sit down, go sit down. Jessie knows this joke very well. I think, right? 'Cause you have a grandpa. And so there's this kid and his grandpa and he's smoking, the kid's smoking... No, the kid is smoking? She's so smart. The grandpa's smoking, the kid is not smoking and the boy goes to the grandfather, "Can I have a cigarette?" And the grandfather says, "Does your dick reach your asshole?“ And you got it. And so the boy says no and so the grandpa says, "Well then you can't have a cigarette." And so then the next day, grandpa's boozing. Cheers to gramps. And the little boy says, "Gramps, can I have a drink?" And grandpa says, “Can your dick reach your asshole yet?" And the boy says no and the grandpa says, “Then you, you know, you can't have any of my beer." The next day the boy has a cookie and the grandpa goes up to him and he says, "Grandson, that cookie looks so delicious. "Can I have a bite?" And the little boy says, "Well grandpa, can your pee-pee touch your bum?“ And the grandpa says, “As a matter of fact, it can.“ And the kid said, "Well, good, Grandpa, go fuck yourself. "This is my cookie.“ That's the end. So, to Leif and Mindy. - Sweet, classy, classy gal. - Take it away. - To love. - To love. That's beautiful. Jessica, thank you. I'm just gonna go check on the food. Please, no more jokes. I'm just checking on the food. I'm just going to the bathroom. Do you need help, Lil? Are we doing sincerity or more dirty jokes? Is she okay? - You okay, Lil? - Yep. Okay. No, it's great. Yeah, it's normal. So, we're going out later. Okay, I need you to listen to Jessica tonight, though because I'm not gonna be home until very, very, very, very late. No movies. No movies, you need to get to bed. Okay, I love you. I'm okay, sorry. I think I'm getting, like, a chest cough. A chest thing? Okay. Cheers! So many guys and dicks. So many guys...

I mean, like, that's... You're so far away from me, I never see you. I feel like I've done the best I... can do, you know, under the circumstances we were in. I feel like you're, there's a lot of... separation. And sometimes I feel you're very angry at me. We don't have to do this. Let's just be supportive. Okay?

It was like I can't breathe. You want to go for a walk? Sure, but I feel like we should get back. Just a little bit. Why did you come? 'Cause it's my best friend's wedding. Yeah, but why did you come? 'Cause I missed you. All the time. So why don't you call me? I was scared. Confused. I just thought that after that night, you know, that there was... Yeah, but you left. Sorry I didn't stay. I don't know what to do. I love you. I love you so much. Sarah. I'll always love you. We should get going. Thank you.
