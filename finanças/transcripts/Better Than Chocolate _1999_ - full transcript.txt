You know, I've just had this terrible letter- - from the university. It was addressed to you, - so I opened it, and it's confirmation of your... Of your withdrawal from school. I mean, I, um... I thought you wanted to be a lawyer. That was... I've been trying to track you down for days. So, uh... So, what's up? Mom, yes, well, I decided it was time I learned about... Life... From, uh, life. And, uh... ...I've got a really wonderful apartment. In a really... Interesting part of town. Uh-huh. It's big, - and it's cheap. An apartment? Really, and it's, um, it's big? Because... Oh, well, the reason I called- - is because, um... ...Michael and I are getting a divorce. Finally? I mean... Are you ok? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, you know, - kind of at my rope's end- - about where we were gonna go, but... ...I mean, if the apartment is as big as you say, - then Paul and I could come and stay with you. I know it's gonna be hard- - 'cause he's gonna have to transfer. Transfer? What do you mean? Is there a high school near you? No. I... I don't know. Anyway, I have to call the bank. And I'm gonna put the, uh... Furniture in storage. And then we'll be there on Friday. Ok? Thank you, Margaret. Thank you, sweetheart. We'll see you soon. Ok, bye-bye. She's coming here... To live with me. No, no, no, no, no, she isn't. This is my bookstore, where you work- - and where I let you sleep on the sofa- - in the back until you find a place, - which will be very soon, - because your mother's not coming here. Try the sublets. And tell your mother you're fucking queer- - before somebody else does. 4 weeks only, then I'm back. I'm gonna leave all my stuff. You got a problem with that? Oh, I'm sleeping on the couch where I work... It's a long story. I don't want to come back to any surprises. Where are you going? I'm off Thursday, - on the love that latex safe sex tour. Oh. I'm giving safe sex-demonstrations- - from tuktoyaktukto yellow knife. So, you want to take it? You saved my life. What... what titles? I don't know. They are holding up my fucking books- - at the fucking border again, - and they won't even tell you what fucking titles? These people don't fuck. That's the problem. If any of those idiots from customs call, - I'll be on the phone- - to the civil liberties association. This is gonna ruin me. Good morning. Good morning. Did you find a place? Yes. You did? Yes. Good. Customs held up another order of books- - at the border. They're claiming the books are pornographic. Hello! Which they aren't. Well, maybe butches in chains is. But so what? You were great the other night at the club. I didn't know you were looking for a place to live. You could stay with me. I've got some new toys. 5-speed vibrator, - magic eggs, - clitishous dancer. No, but thanks. Ouch. It's the light of the bisexual. Gay girls won't play with you. You're not bisexual, Carla. You're omnisexual. You're like that tornado in the wizard of oz, - sweeping up everything in your path. You need to let go more. Yep, that's me. Letting it all hang in. Oh, Carla, my mother and brother- - are coming to stay with me, - and I don't want you to frighten them, - all right? Promise? Promise. Hey, Maggie! Hey, can you believe she's never been- - in my coffee shop? Tell her how great it is. Hey, come on, I just got here. I haven't been anywhere. Come on, - tell her how great it is. Fuck. It's great.Fuck. Yeah, see? Can I take a peek? Oh, no, no, no. Could you maybe- - just add a little bit more hair up top? I mean, what is art all about, right? Illusion. Well, to quote whistler, a successful picture- - is the thrust, movement, counter movement, - and final equilibrium of forms- - and colors in pictorial space. Which means... More hair. Yeah, just a little bit. There. Finished? Done. Minchia, Maggie. Is that a good-looking guy, or what? Whoo-hoo! Hey, you know what I'm gonna do with this? Gonna hang it up in my cafe. I don't know, I'm thinking maybe you come in, - I give you free Cappuccino's. Yeah, it sounds great. It's, um, still $20 for the picture, though. Ok, free coffee for a month. Do I look like I'm anywhere- - for a month? Ok, with the coffee, you get my homemade grappa. Real kick, 100%. 100% what? 100% kick. Trust me. See you, Maggie. Bye, Tony. Sit down.

I'm doing that on the road thing. But, um... ...I'm not in any rush. You want to go for coffee? Ok, here we go. Excuse me. Try it. Oh, my God. That's not a kicker. That's a one-two punch. That'll put hair on your chest. Let's see this. Hey, Felipe, you want to wash these glasses here? What am I supposed to serve these things in, anyway? You're good.

Don't you have any wine? No. Mom. So, um... I thought you could take the bedroom, - and, Paul... You could bunk down in the hall, - and Kim and I could just bunk down- - in the back room.

Oh, God. I don't need another window display. I need a lawyer. Little red riding hood? What is going on with customs? Little red riding hood and the big bad wolf? That little red riding hood? Do we stock that book? A customer ordered it for her niece. They're trying to ruin me. Customs. That's what it is. Attention, shoppers. I got a letter from my father today. The same father who told you to drop dead? That father? Yes. No. Well, what I mean is, - his lawyer wrote me, - and he says my parents are gonna buy me a condo, - so that after the surgery, I'll have some place to go, you know, - to recuperate, to have some sense of security. I mean, wow. Not a word from them since I told them... Nothing in 2 years... and now this. They miss me. I'm gonna write them- - and invite them up for a housewarming party. Please, buy the condo and move my mother in. How is your mom? And I see you have a new friend. Whoo! Whoo. Yeah. Kim is... Staying with me. Yeah... And her mother and her brother. Mmm. Sounds complicated. Well, you know, I have an extra room. This is Carla... And Judy. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. So, I was thinking of the heritage peak condos- - they're putting up down the street. I mean, do you think your mom and I could live there? Cheap and tawdry good smasquerading as quality. Comme moi. I'll be a heritage homo. Frances, - now that I'm almost a woman- - of almost means, - I was wondering if maybe- - you'd like to go out with me sometime? Well, you know, um, - Oh... Gosh, I'm really, really busy. Ahem. There's practically a war on here. Excuse me. You can run, but you can't hide. So... Have you told your mother about your honeymoon yet? No. I want her to leave. I don't want to kill her with the shock. Come on, she can take it. Parents can be very resilient. What does she do all day? Shop, cook, clean, decorate. Hmm. She sounds lonely. Hi. I'm Judy. Is Maggie home? Oh, um... Gee, she's not. You know, she and Kim went out again. Oh. I brought her the seas a housewarming gift. Well, for all of you, really. Well, how lovely. I'm... I'm Lila. I'm Maggie's mother. Nice to meet you. And you're... Judy. Maggie's friend Judy. Just think of me as the welcome wagon. Well, welcome. Would you like to come in? Yes. Thank you. Boy, it's quite a climb, isn't it? Oh. I almost got an aneurysm. And here... And here. Oh, lovely. Thank you. Welcome. Mmm.Mmm. You know, I just love that shirt. Thank you. I do my best with my limitations. It's so hard to find nice things to wear- - when you're my size. Oh, you should be proud of your size... So strong and so striking. I think the word you're looking for is "enormous." Exotic. Thank you. I just wish Maggie had some of your sense of style. Oh, no, Lila. Maggie's... Maggie's lovely. She's very clever, you know. Yes. Yes, she is, but... What is going on with her these days? Mmm. You'd have to ask her that, Lila. So, there is something going on? Oh, well, she's 19. There's always something going on when you're 19. More wine? Did you ever wake up one morning- - and feel that everything in your life was wrong? Mmm. Because I woke up one morning last month, - and... And I know this sounds silly, because, you know, housewives... Excuse me. Homemakers, - as we're now called, - aren't supposed to have existential crises. Oh... I think homemakers- - have existential crises all the time. Well, I found out- - that my husband had been having an affair. Oh. And it had been going on for more than a year. A year? That's a long time. I had the choice right then- - to either carry on... Or break it up. Oh, my goodness. You're easy to talk to. Oh. Here's to strong women. To strong women. God loves you. Hey, I'm busy here. Jesus loves you. Thank you. Can you still read "die, dyke, die," - or do you think I've finally gotten it all off? Uh-uh. Ohh. Ahh... Hey, Maggie, you know, we never used to have graffiti- - around here... never. Yeah. I think it's my window displays. Oh, yeah. Listen, Maggie, first it's graffiti, - then they start breaking windows, - then God knows what's next. Certain people, - you don't want to attract their attention, - Capisce? Capisce. Hey, I don't need people writing "dyke"- - on my coffee bar, all right? Do I look like a dyke to you? Come on. You're riding shotgun. Where are we going? Customs, baby. Ooh. Hey, hey, hey! Who's supposed to clean this shit up now, huh? Excuse me. Yes? Can you direct me to Mr. Marcus' office? Downstairs, turn right. You see, buildings like this are actually designed- - along the lines of a rationalist conspiracy. The thing is not to be bamboozled, - just know where you're going and go there. I am so sorry. Aah! Don't ask. Oh, boy. The books have been classified as obscene- - and will not be allowed through the border. Now, if I can just get you to sign here... Little red riding hood is obscene? Well, we... we thought that was something else. I'll bet you did. Our mistake. However, titles such as... The lesbian S&M virtual sex manual- - and a guide to a... Ahem. Anal safe sex- - will remain here with us. Something to read on those dark, lonely nights. If I could just get you to sign here, here, and here and here, - you can have little red riding hood- - back within the week. Seriously, Mr. Marcus, - the supreme court has declared that anal sex- - is to gay male sex- - what Mozart is to classical music. Miss Turner, we are not here to discuss classical music. I myself am a huge Mozart fan, but... Look, the fucking supreme court- - has declared this material is not obscene! In case you haven't noticed, this is not the supreme court. We are here in customs, and I have a job to do. Oh, just following orders, are we, asshole? From your perspective, - that must be a compliment of mozartian proportions. Security! Security! Frances, I think you should let him go. Do we have a problem? Bernice? Bernice, is that you? My God, I haven't seen you- - since the womyn's music festival.

Ultimately, the cube melts, - and the books are liberated. But ruined. Liberated, but ruined. It's conceptual. Ooh, yes. I love the layers of meaning. Like a Popsicle... There's an orange layer- - and a blue layer and a pink layer. Mm-hmm. Now, you were going to clean up- - after your conceptual- - once it starts to melt, right? Oh, yeah. Right. "For bright pink, - use whole dye package." So, have you known Margaret long? No, actually, not that long at all... Maybe about a week. Mmm. Seems like longer. Yes. You two seem very close. We are. Actually, that's something I'd like to talk... Margaret never really had any friends- - in high school. I mean, she was a straight-a student, - so she was always studying. But that's why I don't understand- - why she has quit university. It's what she always wanted. Hmm. Have you been to university? Art school. Ah, art school. I went to music school, you know. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. I used to sing... Puccini, verdi. You sang opera? I know. I hardly seem like the prima Donna type now, - but, yes, I... I had to give that all up, of course. Why "of course"? Well, because it's... it's nonsense, really. I mean... You know, if you can't be great, - if you can't be the best... That's ridiculous. What if it's what you really love to do? Lila, I want to talk to you about something. Maggie and I... You didn't ask Maggie to quit university, did you? No. No, no, no. I didn't. I did want to talk to you- - about her and... Well, and about me. We're in love. Well, that went well. 712 heritage. All right. This must be the place. My résumé. I am woman. Are you hereabout the job, dear? Oh, yes, ma'am. Uh, ahem.
