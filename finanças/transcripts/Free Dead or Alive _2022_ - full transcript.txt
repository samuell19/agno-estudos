Here, condoms and birth control. I am sorry, please keep that filth to yourself. Please, perhaps you should sit down. There are some things you don't know about the journey north. And please, you need these, too. My wife and daughter don't need these. Why don't you save yourselves the trouble? You don't tell me and my family where to go. I would listen to him. Vile creature, don't listen. No, no, let him speak, they deserve to know. Know what? Know, know that your wife and your mijita are gonna be raped. And your son will be murdered. And the padre, the father, the father, husband, sole protector, will die trying to defend them, or die in shame, in the guilt of your failure. Hundreds and thousand miles away from home. Who are you supposed to be? To some, I am the ugly truth. To others I am Recelo. But the real question is, how much are you and your family willing to pay to get to America? Perdon, perdon. No. No, please. You took the line of credit, knowing you could not pay it back. Now we take your wife to settle the debt. Machete! Her. Please. No. Put her in your hands. Please, a beautiful woman like you should have everything she wants in her life. If you don't take my money, I'm gonna put everything back. What? You think you're too good to not accept my kindness? Nothing in this store is worth anything other than my money. Eva! Jesus, Eva, I could have... Look at you. I've always told you, you would thank me one day. A knife is an extension of a woman's power- - What have you done now? I have some good news for you. What? You spent our rent money again? You think rent money can buy all of that? Where'd it come from, then? I know you didn't earn it. What? An old whore like me ain't worth a life, huh? Ma, I didn't say that. Us women cannot hide from the truth. It always finds us. Anyway, it is what it is. So, what is it this time? I found you a husband, raised in Puerto Rico. A husband? Yes, in fact, he's gonna be here tonight. So you might want to get cleaned up. Look, I even got you a new dress. Mama. This is worse than what I would expect even from you. What, finding you a wealthy husband that can take you away from all this filth is somehow bad? Wealthy husband. I've told you, I don't care- Yeah, I know you don't care about money. But Eva, look, I got you the best of both worlds. This kid is handsome! You know he says he's looking for one-of-a-kind woman. So, okay. Just so there's no confusion let's be clear about this, You sold me to him. Leave it to you. Leave it to you to find something negative on everything. Yeah, I got a little something out for me, so what? I don't deserve nice things? Eva. What are you waiting for? I don't need you to take care of me. A strong, smart woman, it's a rare thing. You're finally met with real opportunity, and what do you do, huh? You stand there with your head in the clouds, with a suitcase packed ready to go nowhere. It's my life! It's not a thing to be sold or traded for a new TV. I know you, you're just planning to give it to some local farmer. And you're sitting on a goldmine, right between your skinny little legs. Eva, you're not gonna have to be hungry anymore. All you have to do is say yes to one man, instead of waiting for a man that doesn't exist. Look, you're beautiful. You are, oh, my God, you're far more beautiful than I ever was. And I want what's best for you. You know I was young once, and I also searched for my knight in shining armor, and I was betrayed by your dad, the one man, the one man I thought I could trust- Ay, Mama, I know, my father, the war, the ultimate proof that no man can be trusted. Look at me. So silly. I shouldn't have. Us women should not waste our time with tears. I'm not something to be sold. I'm going to be free and alive with a local goat herder that I love, or free and dead with all the other things you say never existed to begin with. How great you could have been if you were born somewhere with opportunity. I'll make my own opportunities. Of course you will, but for now, can you just do your mama a favor? Look, just meet with this man tonight. If he's not what you want or what you feel that you deserve, then we'll just say no. Yeah, we'll say no and we'll give him back all his shit. But I'm not wearing that dress. So what did you think? I don't know, it was an okay movie. What do you want to do next? Hungry? No, I'm full from the popcorn. Plus it's getting late and I've been working all day. We discussed the car, Miguel. Ah, yes, I know, you made it painfully clear you're not getting in. But to be honest, I don't know why you wouldn't trust me. Trust is earned. That takes time. Fair enough. So let's take another walk around the barrio. No first date can be complete without ice cream. - Okay. - Cool? Yep, short walk around the barrio. So what's the secret? For a man like me to win your heart? My heart's not something to be won. It's something I'll share with the right man at the right time. Yes, that sounds like a dream some American gringa might have. Maybe so, at least I got one. What's your dream? My dad runs a cartel, I will run a cartel. No dream is necessary. You don't want more out of life, to blaze your own path? What more is there than being rich and powerful? A lot more, like being happy. Being free. Yes, that's what poor people say. Wait 'til we are married. - Ouch. Then you'll see true happiness and freedom. Oh, slow down, I didn't say I would marry you. I just met you, we- We what? You don't want the life I can give you? You know, Eva, I do like this whole diamond in the rough routine, but I think you might be taking it a bit too far. Routine? You're beautiful, yes. The question is, for how long? In a place like this, your mother's a whore. I'm offering you a way out. Come on, now you're getting in my car. You think you're offering me a better life, with you in a cartel? You can get your little trinkets tomorrow. I'll see myself home. Let's go, Miguel. Run, Eva, run! Run! You know, you can improve on the cooking. Help me out here. I'm trying to figure out, why would the daughter of a whore think she can tell me no? Hmm. All that money and power, and this is what you do when you don't get your way? I assure you, I always get my way. Take back everything, you hear me? We're not interested. Now you listen to me. We paid for a special woman and drove to this shit hole of a town. Now I am taking home what I have purchased. Once we're married, I won't let anyone else put their hands on you. Watch the face. Eva! I've been hit like that before. He was 12, he didn't have a gun, though. I thought we'd never get past foreplay. Miguel, you know, you're going through a lot for this one. She's a woman money can't buy. What the fuck is taking them so long? Go check. Go! I can't believe you grabbed that stupid suitcase. I killed a man. Look, that man deserved to die. Don't you give it a second thought. It's your fault. No, mija, you're the one that is too proud. All you had to do was say yes. We have to figure out what we're gonna do. I'm not going back. We can hide in the next town. I'm leaving. I know that, we're both leaving. No. I'm going to America. I get it. I let you watch too many Disney movies. Going to America. It's a sure way to die. No, Mama, I'm going to be free, to choose my life. You're so stubborn. Just like your mother. I have taught you all that I can. If you choose to be a fool, you will learn, as I learned. Thank God we're survivors. I love you, Mama. I love you too. Go, go, go, go. It's 2 a.m. in the morning. Could you come back later, please? What are you doing? This is not a hotel. I need you to help me pray. What are we praying for? Forgiveness. For one who seeks salvation, the Heavenly Father grant forgiveness. I killed a man tonight. Murder is not something easily... I'm not seeking forgiveness for myself at the moment. Then please explain to me, what are you doing here? I'm here to ask my father to forgive himself, just long enough so he can say goodbye to his daughter. If you have come into this church to cause any trouble- You were the one man she thought she could trust. I'm a man of God. This is my church. And I am your greatest sin. Don't you look away from me. Please don't- - Please. Just go. Go. Wait. Where are you going? To America. Along the migrant route? Do you have a coyote? A coyote, to steal my money and leave me stranded in the middle of nowhere? Not all coyotes are created equal. How much money do you have? 1,000 US. That's not enough. You'll never make it past Guatemala with that, unless... This is worth more than gold. This will pay for your passage into America. She still loves you, you know. After the war, she came to me, looking for salvation. And she found nothing but sin. Besides, having a drunk for a mother, and a lying hypocrite for a father, what kind of life would that have been for you? One I would have gladly welcomed. Hold on. Think about the road ahead, not the one behind you. You don't have much time. He's leaving soon. I have a moped out back. You can leave it with the nuns in the shed. Go and find this particular man, the one that they call the Dragon. He's a coyote. The best of its kind. True to his word, tough as nails. Show him that coin. He owes me a favor. Let's go. Get up. Are you Dragon? Who are you, what do you want? - To get to America. - How much do you have? Go here in line with them. Now, follow me. No, you're mine. Hey! Get in. I won't ask again. Where are we going? You're not gonna help them, the others? I know my limits. Where'd you get my coin? Your coin? For sure as hell wasn't your friend's back there, so answer my question. I, I don't even know you. You need to answer my questions when I ask them. A priest from- Come out. Where are we going? What are you doing here? Going to America. Let me guess, your flight got canceled, so you want to take the scenic route? You have no idea what I've been through. Save it, everyone's got a story. Please tell me you got other clothes in that suitcase of yours. If you give me a minute to change, then yes. You got five minutes. As for me, I got three rules. Rule number one, don't ever take on more than you can carry. In other words, know your limits. Rule number two, answer my questions when I ask them. Keeping things from me can get us both killed. And rule number three, the most important one, don't be a quitter, nobody likes a quitter. So we're gonna walk all the way to America? I thought everyone took the train up north. Not everyone. You know, there's a trail just above us that we could use to travel faster. What are you doing? We have an agreement, I know what I owe you. No more. No less. Shh. A little further. Are you fucking crazy? You left me back there. I didn't want you to think that I owe you anything. I didn't leave you back there, okay? We stay off the beaten path, no one will find us here. My father said you were some kind of tough guy coyote. But all you do is run and hide. Your father? Well, okay, you want to stay back and fight the whole Salvadorian police department, huh? I've made this trip more times than you have. My way is under the radar. No unnecessary risk. You have first watch, wake me up in four hours. It's not her. Do you want me to call your father? And tell him what? Two of our men got killed by a girl and her drunk mother? He's my best tracker. Said he finds her tracks out along the mountain ridge. The mountain? We're talking about a woman, alone. She's not alone, and this is a route known to be used by a coyote named Dragon. Dragon has a storage unit not too far run by the gangs. This shit keeps getting better. That's impossible, my father killed him. Even if it was, no man would be stupid enough to try that again. We can't afford to underestimate this woman anymore. Her and her mother might be two motherfucking samurais, for all we know. Five minutes. Use the bathrooms, maybe take a shower? We can't leave a trail. A trail? The people who saw us. People can smell fresh soap and perfume for miles around. And to go where we're going, the less attractive we are, the better. Hey. I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot. Wait, hold up. The cartel's tracking you. Cartel is tracking me? Don't play dumb, everyone thinks I'm dead. Why is there a small army after you? You broke the rules, deal's off. You can't do that. You owe a debt to my father. Lady, what do you think this is, huh, some kind of game? I can't beat them all. I don't need you to beat them all. I just need you to get me to America. Do you have any idea what's ahead? Yes, I mean, I know it's tough. Tough? There are cities, right, whole countries waiting to kill us as soon as we set foot on their soil. Not to mention the cartel hunting you. Not paying your debt, huh? Is that your fourth rule? If we keep going, there's no going back. I accepted that the moment I got in that car with you. Now it's your turn. Keep your head down. I got a storage unit up the block. There's a better way. Not our problem. Under the radar, remember. Where's my fucking money? Where'd that bitch go? Mother fucker. Yeah, I stole your shit! You not gonna do shit about it. You're lucky that door's locked. Or I'll fuck you up. Go. Hey. Hey. I heard you were dead, man. You heard wrong. Hey, sexy! Why don't you come over here? Why don't you come over here to me? Who's next? What are you waiting for? Cut the bitch! Ahh! Should we take his gun? No. If the police finds us with a gun, we'll be in jail forever. I'm fine. Well the manager of this place stole my motorcycle, so the plan changes a bit. Where'd you learn that? - My mother. - Your mother? She grew up in Esalgo in the aftermaths of la matanza. The massacre? My grandparents were killed by government snipers. More than 10,000 murdered in all. Terrible time. My mother joined the rebels, plot against the government. She was recruited to become an assassin, small unit tactics, knife fighting. She sounds like a remarkable woman. What about your father? They were both looking for answers and found each other, fell in love. She gave it all up to be with him. Said there were just too many assholes in the world to kill, but it didn't last. My father couldn't handle the shame. He went back to the church and abandoned us when I was still a baby. I'm sorry he wasn't there for you, but your father, he saved my life, hid me from the cartel. I've been caught in the middle my whole life. I can't do this, not allowed to do that. My mother and father had to spend their whole lives trying to forget one war, while preparing me to fight in another. I understand. So, what's the new plan? We're in it. We use this car to get to Guatemala. And after we get to Guatemala? Catch a taxi, and then no more help from me. - Wait, I can't- - Eva, you're gonna get us both killed, do you know why? 'Cause you don't listen. I don't listen? Do you remember rule number one? Never take on more than you can carry. Problems between here and the border are gonna slow you down and suck you in. So you do as I say, or no more help from me. Deal? Hey Timely motherfuckers. You two lost? Hey we're cool! Just passing through. Hey, tranquilo. We didn't do that. Hey, the Brazilian. He's my father. The Brazilian is your father huh? Legit. Miguel. We'll be on our way. You're pretty far from home, and I'm thinking they might pay a good price to see you return. Let me kill one of them. Send a message to the cartels to think twice about setting foot on our turf! Yeah. Let's get 'em! - What do we do? - Stay close, and shut up. - You called my father? - Yesterday. I'm going to take what's mine, and, uh- The hell you are. We're not scared of you. And you can keep what's yours. I trust our arrangement remains in place, unless, you are not in control. Come on. If I hadn't called him, you'd be spending the next few weeks tied up in a closet in this shit hole country! Not even married yet, and your woman's already pushed you to the bottle. So, this woman I hear about, she's one in a million? Hmm? Is that so? You idiots get two of my men killed, then sit here with nothing to show for it. We did find out that Dragon might still be alive. So you say, a dead man walks. And aren't we riding the beast here? I mean, we could just ride the train straight to Mexico. I wouldn't be in any rush to be getting on that train. Who's this guy? Our driver. And that stuff? And who's the man in the picture? That's his driver. You'll understand when you get to America. What's he doing now? Taxi driver in Guatemala has one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. Over 900 drivers were killed here last year alone. Canesto has been driving this van for over three years now. He's the best your money can buy. My money? I mean, yeah, I could pay, but... Don't worry. I'll pay half. I'm riding too. I heard you got into trouble with the Brazilian on your last run. Look at you. Lying here in pain. Your flock is dead, trooper. You planning on settling down? Nah, it's not like that. She's just a job. So was my wife. Hold on. Good luck. Let's go. Come on, I got you, come on. We should keep going. We stop here. He's right there. Couldn't catch him in an old, broken van. What makes you think we'll catch him in a car? More than you can carry. Remember our deal. File was built on information, pieced together on a ghost. Soledad is a very dangerous woman. Could she be found? Me and my tracker have a lead. - Thank you for this. - Glad to be of service. Tracker. Why her? I don't expect you to understand. You think I don't know how to think like an idiot? So, it's idiotic to want something money can't buy? You have a lot to learn. It's idiotic to want a woman like that in the first place. She's a prize. One of a kind. You always said a man shouldn't settle, so I haven't settled. I have said that. It's true. We live in a rough world where the strong thrive, however, we have dreamers that think they're better than us. Give 'em some space, and they'll even think they're stronger than us, then others will believe it. That's when they come for your head. So that's why you hunt Dragon? That's exactly why. He's just some second rate coyote, taking the peasants and whores. I had thought that, too, at first. Then I started hearing all these whispers with his name, along with words like brave, honor, tough. I sent him a message, and he killed one of my men. Pablito! Sending a message back to me! Let me know that I couldn't buy him, and that he wasn't afraid of the cartel. I killed all those men whispering, and I will kill Dragon. I understand. Do you? You gonna pay cash or...? Cash. Cash. That's it. This is the only money I have. Oh, no, no. No, you keep your money for your family. We can work out something else. Mm, mm. Let's go. Mama. I don't believe it. I have been praying! You couldn't even call your mother to let me know you were alive! I see, now. No, hold on, mom, it's not what you think. Why don't you go freshen up, dear, and I'll make us something to eat? - Just down there. - Yes? Her father took me in. A priest. This man, the Brazilian, can you beat him? He runs a cartel, ma. Controls it from here to Tijuana. That's not what I asked you. Thank you. I'm sorry, I haven't- Ugh, please, eat. Don't mind me. You're the first woman my Derwin has ever brought home- I'm fine. Dragon and I- Oh, relax. He told me everything. Of all the things to want to grow up to be. Kids dream of being doctors, lawyers, a sports star. My son becomes Dragon, El Coyote. I need a drink. How 'bout you? I'll take a tequila. Tequila it is. Ah. This is delicious, thank you so much. Oh, that's my son's favorite, too. So that's one thing you have in common. I'm afraid your son and I have nothing in common. Eh, he's alive, you're alive. That's two! You're fishing. To fishing! - Ah. - So, tell me. What are you going to do in America? Be free to live my life. To do what? What do you mean? Well, you can be free anywhere. What are you going to do with all that freedom? Be free to become who I'm meant to become, no matter the case. I'll do a lot more than let innocent people die while I just watch. Seen a lot these past few weeks, huh? You know, my late husband, Dragon's father, was a police officer here, in Guadalajara. All he ever talked about was saving lives, helping the community. We have a son. As soon as he could talk, he's saying the same. Wanted to be just like his father. But then my husband was shot and killed in the line of duty. Hard thing, losing a hero. Even harder when that hero is your father. I'm sorry. I grew up without my father. I know. I can see the chip on your shoulder. When a young kid is touched by that kind of pain, it shapes them. Adds a darkness to them that even the prettiest smile can't hide. That pain also takes away hope. Like I see with you, and my mother, the world is what it is, and we should be happy with what we got, never, ever ask for more. Can you blame a mother? When your child is involved, maybe the risk is too much. I still remember when my son took the first group of people across the border. He was still so young, and happy, smiling all the time. He took the first group across, excited to be making a difference, and the second and the third, and something began to change. But by the fifth trip, he was not the same. Locked himself in his room, Didn't eat for a week. When he finally emerged, he was a different man. Different how? First, he had these three rules. Oh, yes. I've heard those quite a few times. Men will tell you something until it hurts, won't they? Mothers, too. Oh, wise one, aren't you? How old are you, if you don't mind my asking? 25 today. Today? Mm-hm. - Your birthday is today? - Mm-hm. Ah! We need to celebrate! That's what I'm doing! Nonsense. There is always a party in town, but we have to pace ourselves. Salud. Ah! Vamanos. What about Dragon? He'll find us when he's ready. Ladies and gentlemen, DJ Dub is in the house, and it's about to go down. Gracias, and one for my friend, please. ¿Como no? Another. To getting older and wiser. Older and wiser. Salud! Mmm. Ah! Ooh. Oh, okay. My son is one of the best dancers in town. Okay. You found yourself a good woman there. Morning. I made you some coffee. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting company. Can you watch the stove for me? I have to go to the market. No, you don't have to, I can go. - You can go? - Of course. Let me give you a bag. Thank you. - Of course. I'm sorry! - I thought she- - Was alone? They made me. He's having the life. Come on, Miguel. You really need all these people to hold your hand. Look who's holding my hand now, mi amor. Drop the knife. You're late to your wedding. It's all over now. Nobody's going to help you. Last time I waited outside and left you to work through everything alone. Your visa came in. I wanted to surprise you and Eva with it. I'm not going to let you bring others to freedom, while you stay here, locked away in this prison with me. This is not a prison. This is a prison! Times have changed, and things are no longer safe for you here. That is why you must go. You have a lot of choices to make, but please do not come back. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah. Clean up, you filthy slut. Yeah. You might have to rape me dirty. I hope they let me put you out of your misery. We have this bet going, how much of this bottle is it gonna take to make you beautiful again. Again? I think we may even need another bottle. Hey, save some of that bottle for me. This filthy slut might have a surprise for you. Yeah. Eva? I thought we were past this, dear? You have made your point, I understand. And I promise not to mistreat you in our life together. Get the fuck out here, or I'll have your mother gutted and turned into paste. Now, that's more like it. Come. Aren't you a sight? You are going to ask me why. My father asked me why you too? It was a great question that really made me think. Seeing you here, defiant, it helps me understand. It's complicated because you have given me a long time to think about this. It's not for beauty, 'cause I can have almost any beautiful woman I see. It's for what you are. As you know I will run a cartel and live in this world of luxury. It's dark, and you, my love, will bring the light. At my darkest moments I can look up to you and maybe think about what could be. That hope will keep a part of me alive, in this darkness. You will be taken care of, maybe even loved, but you will never be free because I can't be free. Now put on your dress and the guards will escort you to the altar, or the kennels where we keep the bitches. Can I see my mother? Of course. You think I'm some kind of monster? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. We got a place for you. That piece of shit Recelo. He was right. I will die in shame, miles from my home. Help me, and I'll help you get your family back. But I have three rules. So I've got a car backed up there. I've got 10 guys up here. We'll start with the south and then... Okay, so we're improvising. Now you wanna watch your mother die? Would you like to see your daughter die? Go. Go, go, go, go. What happened to the rule number one? You never let me state my exceptions. There's something I must do. You might need this. I'll meet you at the gate. You okay? Eva? This bastard had the nerves to bleed on the smokes. What a waste. We need to get you out, get up. Are we in heaven? Are we, are we both dead? What? I'm killing assholes. I'm drinking tequila, and my daughter, oh, she's finally getting married. Come on, let's go. Ay, Eva. Eva, wait! Wait. - What? So you're not getting married? No. We're getting Dragon and we're getting out of here. Eva, Eva! Eva! Listen, you got balls on you, but you're a fool if you think some man is gonna come here and save you. He's different. Eva! My father, he asked me to give you a message. Enough! Let's go! Mom- Okay, let's discuss only. Well, look at that, she's all dressed up for her wedding. My future wife! Wow, you look so beautiful. You can take your mother. Clean yourself up. Father, the bride to be. Keep an eye on them. No guns. This is a wedding. I'm not doing this. We brought knives to a gunfight. Dragon, the Coyote. The little cucaracha, always hiding in the dark. But tonight, we settle everything, once and for all. You think you can fight the cartel? You think you can beat me, huh? I came to do more, then just fight you. Get him. Don't worry, I'll put you out of your misery. That's a problem. Look at you. Scars make sure we grow stronger. Okay, where's my bride? Come on. Go get my bride. Someone bring me a gun. Are you sure you wanna marry this woman? Go get 'em. What did your, what did your father say? He said. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I never stopped loving her. I want to say something wait, before I die. You women are trash. Filth is in your blood. Get down! - Let's go. - Who's that? It's Dragon, come on. Say goodbye! No! You'll be fine mami. Mama, mama, don't close your eyes. Mama, mami please, stay with me. Stay with me, mama. Mommy. What the heck are you still doing here? Making sure you're okay. You lost a lot of blood. And you found something I told you didn't exist. A man you could actually trust. Yeah. And we can all be safe together. I'm not going with you. People will see me, and they will charge you. You might even ruin what you have going with him. He said you're a remarkable woman. He's a smart boy. You don't wanna ask me anything about him? They say, they say that you can see the worth of a man on the eyes of his woman. I can see this man is worth his weight in gold. You did good. I can't leave you again, Mommy. I can't. Mija, Eva, every generation ends up with debt. But then, the next generation gets a chance to move forward, pay it off. Move forward, my love. You are now free.
