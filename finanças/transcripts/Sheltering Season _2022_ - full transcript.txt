"...of a Jellyfish in Limbo." Oh, my God. Nobody in the history of forever would forget that title. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. In my defense, I came up with that while I was on my first ayahuasca cleanse, so... Didn't you do like 12 session in 30 days? WOMAN: It was 10. Close. Things might have gotten a little too clear.

Not sure if he's gonna make it, though. Okay. I mean, we can all understand that. Sure. Hey, maybe he'll finally get to building that bunker - he's been talking about. - Oh, my God. - Is he still talking about that? - MAN: Of course he is.

Maybe it's best that you are alone out there. Mama! [ Both laugh ] - Got you, Mama! - Whoo! I got to go. Bye. [ Music continues ] [ Fire crackling ] MAN 2: She's not even here to defend herself. - MAN: Oop. Hey, she's back. - WOMAN: She's just in time. June's telling stories about your family again. JUNIPER: We're like 14, and it was me, B.K., Lil, and Lil's grands. We were headed to the Detroit River to go fishing, and the whole time on the drive, Lil's grands is drinking what we all just assumed was water till Lil reaches over to take a sip and... ...hacks everything up, all over inside the car. It was vodka. Her grandmother polished off almost an entire pint glass on the drive. She always did that. It was different times then. WOMAN: Dude, your grandma was legend. No. My grandfather was the legend. He would drive us to the movies drinking beer and just chuck his empties into people's yards and say, "Who wants some free money?" "Who wants some free money?" That's right! - That's funny. - Hey, Rex! You made it. How you doing, bud? REX: Looks like you might've lost your razor there, Diego. DIEGO: You like that? My new pet. WOMAN: Oh, please don't egg him on. DIEGO: I hardly get out anyway. I mean, who am I trying to impress? Hey! - Me. - Whoa. JUNIPER: Hey, Rex, guess where we're supposed to be. MAN 2: June, will you give him a second? We're in Hawaii this time. Oh, I can see that. MAN 2: Not my idea. Wouldn't assume it was, buddy. JUNIPER: Oh, my God. Wait. Did you run into any of those militia nutjobs out there? Naw. They don't usually come out until curfew. MAN 2: I can't believe no one's stopping them. WOMAN: Why would they? MAN 2: A friend of ours, his younger brother was dishonorably discharged from the Marines like two years ago. And now he's running one of the largest militias in Pierce County. That guy. WOMAN: Was it the second or third wave? Was what the second or third wave? The one that hit the police force. Oh, yes. That's right. Something like 40% of the state's police force was wiped out in six weeks. Yeah, it was the third wave, but I heard the exact same excuse on a virtual town hall last week. No, no, no, no. It's not a-an excuse. It's reality. A mutating virus. A spike in the death rate. People are scared, right? I mean, I think it's pretty logical that they're gonna want to take matters into their own hands. MAN 2: Sure. I get it. The variants are getting pretty scary, but...

[ Laughs ] Come on! Say something. - Hi. - There you go. - Hey! - What about you? Say, "Hello, Auntie Juniper, hello, Auntie Lilly."

I'm a bit confused. Why is that? When did you get out? Uh... today. This morning, actually. How? The fourth wave really knocked that place out. They had to get numbers down for safety. Guess I was one of the lucky ones. How are you feeling? Good. Read a lot of books on the inside. My meds have kept me even for the most part, if that's what you mean. Glad to hear it. I love your new place. The walk out here was beautiful. I forgot how much I miss nature. How did you get here? Bus to Paradise Road, then I walked the rest of the way. That's like six miles. Yeah. I learned that the hard way. I wouldn't mind a glass of water if you're okay with it. They don't have a choice, those stadiums. They're built to have people on top of each other. They're talking about only letting in a quarter of the number of the people that they used to. The prices would be outrageous. WOMAN: I would never let you go. I'm not saying I want to. Good, because if you did, I'd make you do your quarantine out back in a tent this time. DIEGO: The stadiums are closed, San. It's a hypothetical conversation. And, uh, I'll obviously wear a mask. - Aah! - [ Laughs ] Looks like I have a bit of a surprise. [ Down-tempo music plays ] How's everybody holding up? B.K.! It's so good to see you. I-I didn't know you were getting out this soon. Yeah. Neither did I. But, you know, it's a different world nowadays. Doctors have a lot more to say about when guys get out and all that. MAN 2: Hey, man. How was it in there? Were the variants as bad as they say they are? BROOKLYN: I-I guess so. Probably a lot like it was out here. I kept thinking it was almost done, and it just kept getting worse. Well, it's good to see you. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I didn't know you guys were doing this. I feel a bit like I'm intruding. JUNIPER: No! No. We are happy to see you. Rex, you're here too, huh? How are you? I wouldn't have thought this kind of thing was your bag. It's not, really. You up at the cabin? I am. I always loved it up there. Did you get my letters? Yes. Yeah. We appreciated you taking the time. I'm sorry. I owe you a glass of water. That would be great. Thanks. [ Birds chirping ] [ Glass taps ] [ Cellphone ringing ] Hello? Why would you let him inside the house? - He needed some water. - Tell him he has to leave. And go where? I'm the only family he's got left. - Not your problem. - He's my brother. Half brother, Lilly, and I really don't give a shit. Well, maybe I do. Are you being for real right now? The world is locked down, Rex. Where exactly is it I'm supposed to send him? He's dangerous, Lilly. Look, I can't do this right now. I got to go. Do I really have to remind... Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. No. It's fine. [ Cellphone chiming ] I just want to see if it's all right if I use the bathroom. Uh, yeah. And here's your water. And it's just down the hall on the right. Thanks. [ Cellphone beeps ] SANDRA: Holy shit, Lil. Are you okay? I'm fine. I thought he had a few years left inside that place. Uh, yeah. He did. Are you sure he's okay? You know, mentally and all of that. LILLY: He seems okay. Yeah, he seems healthy. Is he out on good behavior? Do they do good behavior in mental institutions? [ Whispering ] Diego. I mean, that's where he was, right? State psychiatric hospital. Yeah. SANDRA: Well, I don't think they would let him out - if he wasn't ready. - MAN 2: I don't know. I read about this prison in Alabama. Ninety-five percent of the population got hit with the third wave. It was like a death sentence in there. They had no choice but to let the guys go. SANDRA: I'm sure you're missing some of the fine print, Gabe. That was the one where they tried to cover it up, right? Didn't one of the guys go straight home and murder his wife and her new husband or some shit? GABRIEL: Yes. That is the one. JUNIPER: You guys watch too much VICE. Brooklyn's always been more sensitive than violent anyways. You sure about that? Look, I'm not sure exactly what is going on, but he seems okay. His kind of sickness doesn't go away, Lilly. - He's dangerous. - That's not fair. REX: If this was about being fair, he'd still be locked up. I don't expect you to forgive him, but it's actually... But you're ready to? [ Footsteps approaching ] I, uh... Thanks for the water. I think it's probably a good time for me to get going now. No. Absolutely not. That was about us, not you. And where is it exactly that you're gonna go? [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Computer beeps ] [ Birds, insects chirping ] What, Dad? REX: What do you think is in there, bubba? Maybe dragons? [ Music continues ] [ Stone clatters ] B.K., you remember when you had that mullet? Unfortunately. [ Chuckles ] That was the winter we got into the sledding accident, right? - [ Cellphone ringing ] - So the three of us were on this runner sled, and we hit this jump that launched us 15 feet into the air. And then... bam... we all came crashing down onto B.K., who stood up all stoic, like, "I'm good. I'm good," and then... bam! His knees completely gave out. - BROOKLYN: I had a concussion. - Hello? - DIEGO: No shit. - JUNIPER: Hell yes, no shit. REX: Put him on the phone. LILLY: What? B.K. Put him on the phone. - I want to talk to him. - Out of the question. Lilly, please. I just want to talk to him. Is that Rex? GABRIEL: I've had a few myself. He wants to talk to me, doesn't he? [ Birds chirping ] BROOKLYN: It's okay. Lilly, honestly. It's okay. SANDRA: Well, in other news, I went grocery shopping for... Rex. REX: We had an agreement. Agreements change. Do you want me to call the cops? I'm not really sure how that would help you. I wanted to say hello to my sister, and she invited me inside. Not if I say she didn't. You know what I'm wondering? Why didn't Lilly know I got out three days ago? Why would you keep that a secret from her? What exactly is it you had planned for me up there? Believe it or not, Rex, I still love my sister very much. And while that might anger you, she's the only blood I got left. If you're not out of my house in five minutes, B.K., I will come for you. BROOKLYN: That sounds great. I look forward to it. [ Music continues ] [ Indistinct conversations on computer ] Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. He's just being a good husband. DIEGO: So is Rex getting back on or what? He just needs a minute. He'll be back on soon, I'm sure. Is he gonna stay the night up there? LILLY: Uh, not sure. GABRIEL: He doesn't really have a choice, does he? Curfew's in less than an hour. The curfew thing is real? DIEGO: Hell yeah, it is. Up where he's at, the militia's in control of things too. Trust me, you're best to just stay inside. It's really not as dramatic as it sounds. What? I think it kind of is. I saw them up there when we were hunting a few months back. Automatic weapons, high-powered tranq sidearms. Those guys don't really have to answer to anybody. - And it's legal? - DIEGO: [ Chuckles ] Down in Mississippi, they shot a guy who was out walking his dog after hours. The courts held it up as self-defense. You must have seen the headline on that one... "Defense against the spread of the deadly virus." Man, there were some intense protests over that one. The news is strictly off limits inside. Trust me, what they're talking about is not actual news. I'll be right back. It's refill time. Yeah. I'm gonna come. JUNIPER: Mm! And it's real-beer time too! Hold your hats, ladies and gentlemen. The teetotaler is about to get real fired up. Okay. You're a real funny lady, aren't you? [ Boys shouting ] SANDRA: This is a two-hander! Oh. Be right back. [ Down-tempo music plays ] Has Rex broken curfew before? Uh, only once that I know of. Isn't that a bad idea? It's certainly not a good idea. You mind if I get a refill, too? Yeah. Go for it. I'll be in the living room. Hey. Yeah. Good job driving Mama and Papa crazy. So fun! Get it! SANDRA: You guys! What are you... Hey. No. - Whoa! - Don't touch that, please. - You don't touch that, mister. - I've told you a million times. - Why are you eating this? - What is this?! - Come on.

And... that is exactly why divorce lawyers have been backlogged since the second wave. Am I right? Huh? [ Music continues ] [ Radio chirps ] Aah... [ Imitates explosion ] Are you guys still thinking about having kids? No! Not after what we just heard. SANDRA: [ Laughs ] I mean, I love 'em to death, but they can be a fucking nightmare. Well, that's not a very good sales pitch. SANDRA: A shitty sales pitch. I'm just joking. They were the best things that we ever did, but they can be a fucking nightmare. Hey! There he is! You mind if I have one? Uh, they're Rex's, but sure, if you think it's okay. It's been a couple years, but... I think I could manage. JUNIPER: Hey, if memory serves me right, it's kind of like drinking water for you, right, B.K.? Cheers, big ears! That's the way it goes, big nose. You okay? - Mm-hmm. - BOY: No, it's my turn! - You said! - [ Indistinct shouting ] SANDRA: Hey! Hey! Guys! Where are those time-outs? MAN: I want all masks up. T-minus five mikes and counting until we hurry up and wait. Viper, you are on flares. Flapjack, I want to see mud on your boots from that riverbed. - Let's go. - [ Static hisses ] All right. The lunatics are plugged in. What'd I miss? Tablet time-outs? Really? Great job. I love the parenting style. It's solid. It's responsible. DIEGO: Whatever works. I was actually thinking about something while I was in the kitchen. Why is Rex up at the cabin without you, anyways? Uh... you know how he is. He likes his space. It's not his hunting season. He had some stuff he had to take care of. Harper stuff, right? He's buried up there, isn't he? Yeah. Yeah, he is. I like that. It was a good choice. [ Music continues ] [ Static hisses ] MAN: It's go time. If Tango crosses your path, you know what to do. - MAN: Confirm. Going hot. - [ Static hisses, alarm blares ] [ Cellphone beeps ] [ Exhales deeply ] [ Alarms blaring ] I still can't believe this is a real thing. DIEGO: Every day. It's like clockwork. SANDRA: Well, it did flat line the rate of infections - for about three weeks. - And then? The virus did some schooling. Scientists still don't know how it mutated so quickly. Hey, Brooklyn, how long did they give you to register? BROOKLYN: Five days. After that, it's a parole violation. The only violation is our civil liberties. Anyone with half a brain knows this is how they're tracking us. [ Cellphones chiming ] DIEGO: Snack time? SANDRA: You read my mind. [ Music continues ] [ Static hisses ] MAN: Lockdown is at 100% MAN: Starting rounds now. Heading for the River crest Trail. [ Music continues ] Why would he, of all things, bring up Harper? - I'm not sure. - [ Helicopter whirring ] Looking to purge himself of the guilt, maybe. I don't think that's something you can purge. Well, he was off his meds, right? So do you really blame him or do you blame the off-the-meds guy? Wow. [ Chuckles softly ] I'm just glad I'm not Lilly. Right. I mean, the guy we've been talking to for the last hour clearly isn't the type of guy who could think that a virus had infected the walls of the house. [ Siren wailing in distance ] But no matter how you cut it, it's still him. DIEGO: [ Exhales deeply ] How do you feel about a subject change? Good idea. What'd you have in mind?

[ Music continues ] [ Cellphone buzzing ] [ Cellphone chiming ] [ Line ringing ] [ Cellphone buzzing ] - Hey. - LILLY: What are you thinking? You wouldn't listen to me. You gave me no other choice. He just got out. What am I supposed to do? Tell him to sleep on a park bench? He got out three days ago, Lilly. What? The county called us. Why would you keep that from me? Because you still think it's safe to let him into our house, Lilly. I knew I had to take care of this on my own. Take care of what on your own? I'm not gonna let him hurt you again. What are you saying, Rex? He was supposed to come out to the cabin today. He lied, and he went to you instead. He's the same person he was two years ago, Lilly. He can't be trusted. Wait. Why was he supposed to go to the cabin today? Because I invited him. [ Wood cracking ] [ Whispering ] I got to go. LILLY: What? Wait! [ Music continues ] - Aah! - Aah! I'm not sure what I was thinking. Why did you lie to me? That was Rex. Told you I was supposed to go up there? And you got out three days ago, not today. The truth? If I was Rex, I'd want me dead. He's justified in that. You would be too, which is why I didn't go up there and why it took me two days to walk the six miles from Paradise Road to here. Because I'm scared. Not of death... ...but having nobody. I do wish I could change what happened. We all do. [ Suspenseful music plays ] - [ Static hisses ] - MAN: Lake is clear.

We're always... looking for hard workers. I do like to build things, I guess. SANDRA: I'm gonna head out back. GABRIEL: Hey, Brooklyn, I got to... I got to ask.

I-I was just wondering if it got weird or anything for the nurses. It was a psychiatric hospital. How could it not? JUNIPER: I didn't mean to insinuate anything. I just... I'm just messing with you. JUNIPER: Oh! [ Chuckles ] BROOKLYN: One of the nurses did actually slit her wrists. SANDRA: What? Really? Yep. Yeah, some schizo found her laid out on the bathroom floor and started screaming like a wildcat, and the rest of us ran over to see what was going on. A lot of blood. That's awful. Psychiatric hospitals aren't the happiest of places. Everybody's so fucked up on their meds. I had a reocurring dream inside. A house was on fire around me, and I could hear what sounded like a little boy singing somewhere nearby. [ Down-tempo music plays ] And I would go up to this window... and I would discover Harper on the front lawn just as the house would cave in on me. [ Laughing ] JUNIPER: That sounds like a nightmare, not a dream. It's all about context. When your life becomes a living nightmare... one tends to seek joy in the darkest of corners. [ Music continues ] [ Footsteps departing ] [ Water flowing ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Music continues ] [ Cellphone clicking, beeps ] MAN: Show me your hands. Sir, I can't hear you. Hands! Now! I can't understand you through the mask. - Is that better? - Yeah. Hands in the air. Now! - Sure thing. - [ Spray hissing ] Fuck! [ Coughing ] Fuck! [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Water running ] [ Coughing ] - [ Static hisses ] - MAN: We got a runner! [ Music continues ] [ Clattering ] MAN: I want Tango on his knees in five mikes. Push him to the bridge. I'll cut him off. Headed due southwest, Baker Flats. Repeat... due southwest, Baker Flats. [ Pills rattling ] MAN: I want this motherfucker now, Viper. - Fuckin' now! - [ Static hisses ] [ Music continues ] [ Coughing ] Hands on your head where I can see them. Hands on your head. Now, you try that pepper-spray shit on me, I'll drop your arm from the body at the shoulder. - You got it? - My wife's in danger. Does it look like I give a fuck? God fucking damn it. You stupid piece of fucking shit! You say one smart word, and I'll empty the rest of this in your fucking eyes and mouth. MAN: Come on. Let's go! Move. How long till he'll be here? It's okay. I knew he'd come home as soon as he saw me in his house. - Wouldn't expect any different. - [ Lid turning ] That's not true. He's, uh... I think we all need to be done with the lying now, Lilly. - [ Liquid pouring ] - Agreed. Good. From my count, you have in the neighborhood of 235 sleeping pills in your bathroom. Want to talk about it? What? I've always been good with numbers. Were you going through our cabinets? That's a lot of pills. What did I tell you about going through our stuff? - You're avoiding my question. - That's because it's ridiculous. From where I'm standing, there's only one reason to have that many pills on hand. What are you insinuating? I've been there, Lil. I know what it feels like to want to disappear. I know that you and Rex aren't doing well. I'm just trying to look out for you. Fact number one... We're doing fine. Fact number two... If you came here to pick a fight with me, you probably shouldn't stick around. That's not at all what I'm doing. Then how about you quit going through our stuff and you start showing us a little fucking respect? [ Down-tempo music plays ] If you leave the X, I'm gonna put you on your back. [ Thermometer clicking, beeps ] He's good. VIPER: Sit down. I got this guy. You should head back out. Since when do you log anyone into the system? This motherfucker pepper-sprayed me. Did he take off your mask for you too? Med kit's inside. Get yourself cleaned up and back out there. JUNIPER: Lil, you all right? Just fine. Lil, I've known you my whole life. You're right, June. Lilly's not doing well. You want to tell them or should I? I have no idea what you're talking about. - That's me, then. - You need to be very careful. These are your best friends in the world. Let them help you. Is everything all right, Lil? Everything is fine. BROOKLYN: I thought we agreed to be completely honest. Lilly has a secret she's been keeping from you all. LILLY: Shut the fuck up, B.K. She's been thinking about hurting herself. No, I haven't. You have 200 sleeping pills hidden in the bathroom. They weren't hidden. In a cosmetic case, tucked in the back, under the sink. Because I don't need them! Lil, it's okay! I have not been thinking of hurting myself. You aren't the first one to face this, Lilly. Let us help you. Shut the fuck up, B.K.! You have no idea what you're talking about! You want to know why I have those sleeping pills? Because you killed my son! And for almost 15 months, I couldn't sleep! Whenever I close my eyes, all I see is his face. So yes, I took sleeping pills to try and get some sleep. And guess what. That didn't even work. I kept refilling the prescriptions. I don't even know why. I don't know why I still have his shoes on my dresser or why sometimes I still make him his favorite sandwich just so I can stare at it. I have no idea what the fuck it is you're trying to do here, but if you want to keep it up, then I suggest that you leave! Get the fuck out of my house! [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Birds chirping, keyboard clicking ] I'm not trying to be a problem here. My brother-in-law was released from a psychiatric hospital today. He's in my house alone with my wife. He's dangerous. You know, it's funny how you think it's my fault that you're out here and not at home by your wife's side. Code. There isn't one. Name. Whose name? Your wife's. She's the one expecting you, isn't she? - Lilly. - Right. [ Grunts softly ] This her? Yeah. [ Cellphone chimes ] This is Thomas Millgard, Militia ID 230056. We have taken your husband, Rex Yaleman, into custody. Feel free to reach me at this number with any questions. [ Cellphone thuds ] [ Sobbing quietly ] [ Cellphone chimes ] Yeah. Does she usually respond? Depends on what I've done. [ Cellphone buzzing ] Look at that. This is Thomas Millgard. LILLY: This is Lilly Yaleman. You have my husband. Is he okay? He's fine. Can I speak with him? Please? Make it fast. Rex? You okay? Yeah. I was gonna give B.K. an ultimatum. - LILLY: What? - Stay away from you forever... or I was gonna put him in the ground. What are you talking about? He called, we talked, and he threatened me. Why would he do that? Because he's not well, Lilly. How did he threaten you? - Do you trust me? - How did he threaten you? That's not the fucking point, Lilly! Answer the fucking question, Rex! That's enough. Your husband will be released at noon tomorrow. Geez. You got yourself a live wire, don't you? - Hands were I can see them. - Take it easy. Take it easy. [ Tranquilizer gun clicks ] [ Exhales deeply ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] - Fuck! - [ Glass breaking ] SANDRA: Hey. Was that blood? - JUNIPER: B.K.? - [ Woman singing operatically ] B.K., are you okay? [ Music continues ] [ Music builds, continues ] [ Music stops, remote clatters ] SANDRA: What is he doing? LILLY: I don't know. W-Was he bleeding? The whiskey bottle broke, so it might have been. He might have cut himself. JUNIPER: But wow? What happened? I don't know. I don't... [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Birds, insects chirping ] [ Wood cracking ] [ Music continues ] What happened? Is he all right? Oh, we had an argument, and he came into the kitchen... ...broke the bottle. DIEGO: On purpose? What? Did he break the bottle on purpose? I'm not sure. Well, he was bleeding. LILLY: I guess he was. What do you mean, you guess he was? - Is he all right or not? - I don't know, June. - How do you not know? - LILLY: I just told you... - Fuck! - God damn it, June. JUNIPER: What? It was an accident! Yeah. You know what? Three glasses ago, it was an accident. This seems like a choice. Oh, don't be an ass ho... Just leave it. I don't want you to cut yourself. I'm an adult. I think you can pick up a little glass withou... Fuck! [ Inhales sharply ] - Okay. Let me see it. - No. - Just let me see it. - No! [ Down-tempo music plays ] Juniper. I'm trying to help you. [ Sobbing ] Oh, fine. [ Static hisses ] VIPER: Flapjack, it's Viper. What's your 20? [ Static hisses ] What the fuck? What... God damn it! Fuck. The prisoner has escaped. I repeat... The prisoner has escaped, and he is now armed! I'll head southwest to the cutoff. Let's get this motherfucker. Lil, are you sure he's gone? Maybe we should call the police. He's on parole. I call the police, there's no telling what will happen to him. Okay. It was just a suggestion. [ Cellphone ringing ] Is that Rex? No. - [ Ringing continues ] - I'll be back. SANDRA: Wait. Wait. Lil, h... [ Sighs ] Juniper, what's going on? Remember when those high-school boys harassed us at Riverside Park? I think so. You remember how that ended? Uh, we left or something, didn't we? Brooklyn showed up... and they realized that you were his little sister, and they apologized, and they left. What's your point? Why do you think they apologized? I don't know, June! Because everybody knew Brooklyn wasn't right. They were scared of him because nobody knew how far he would take things. Why are we talking about this? Because when Brooklyn's illness benefits you, you reap those benefits without blinking an eye. But as soon as it gets the slightest bit difficult, you turn your back on him. "Slightest bit difficult"? What happened with Harper was awful, a nightmare. Hell, I don't even think I'll ever get over that. But B.K. was not solely at fault, and you know that. And all I'm saying is that something awful happened because of B.K.'s sickness, but it is in no way fair that he never gets a second chance, because I know how badly he feels. I can see it in his eyes. Are we done? [ Exhales deeply ] Yes. Yeah. We're good. [ Static hisses ] MAN: What happened to L.K.? [ Static hisses ] MAN: He took a tranq dart in the gut. MAN: I'll head out to Dobbs Road. What'd I miss? Shut up. Hey. We were thinking it might be time to call it. Why?! Has anyone seen Lilly? DIEGO: Oh. Found her. Hey, is Rex home? Not yet, but soon. JUNIPER: Lilly has to go find Brooklyn now anyways. SANDRA: What? You do? Why? Brooklyn is a grown man. He's where he needs to be. Nobody's gonna be chasing him down. Oh. Excuse me? Yes, excuse you. I respect your thoughts, June, but what's going on between B.K. and I is none of your business. - Oh, is that right? - Yes, it is right. And I'd very much appreciate it if you'd back the fuck off. FLAPJACK: Hey. Who the fuck are you? Excuse me. I said, who the fuck are you? [ Both chuckling ] [ Engine starts ] [ Gunfire ] Fuck! I think it's getting a little late for us here, so... Oh, you know what? That's just like you. Any hint of conflict, and you crawl away like a coward. Come on, June. Oh, you too? Not that I should be surprised, because you people always thought you were better than me anyway. - [ Cellphone rings ] - DIEGO: Jesus Christ. JUNIPER: Where are you going? - Hello? - REX: I'm in my truck, babe. Home in 40 minutes. - How? - They decided to let me go. Well, no rush. He left. He did? Yes, Rex. Not all of us are liars. I'm sorry, Lil, for all of it. I should have been there with you today. You were right. There was something off about him. Off how? He kept saying stuff. - About me? - And Harper. What did he say, Lilly? What did he say, Li... Fuck. Lilly? Lilly! Fuck! [ Tense music playing ] [ Line ringing ] LILLY: Hi. You've reached Lilly. I'm most likely out in my garden. Leave me a message. [ Beeps ] NEWSCASTER: Another dark milestone this week. Three quarters of a million people have now died in the U.S. alone over this pandemic. [ Siren wailing ] This is a worldwide total of 3,789,000... Fuck! Fuck! JUNIPER: It's all this variant bullshit. We all have to deal with loss. She lost a child, June. You know, being a parent doesn't make you a better person than me. I never said that it did. But you have no problem insinuating that it does. That's not true. - Bullshit! - You know what? Drop it. No. You're picking fights again. I'm tired of it. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Shit. Wine's not drinking itself, is it, June? Fuck you, Gabe. Fuck you. Okay. You know what? I think, uh... I think we're gonna call it, guys. DIEGO: Yeah. Oh, sure. 'Cause I'm the asshole, right? Does anybody know where Lilly went? Whatever. Fuck you all. I'm going to bed. You guys didn't need to see that. It's all good, bud. We know it's not you. SANDRA: I'll text Lilly, let her know that we called it. Yeah, that sounds good. [ Chuckles ] Good night, guys. - Good night. - Good night. [ Down-tempo music playing ] [ Car door closes ] License and registration. REX: Yes, sir. I just... CLARK: We need you to put all four of these windows down. I have a situation with my wife, Officer. License and registration. I'm not gonna ask you again. You in a hurry to get somewhere for a reason, Mr. Yaleman? Or you think the faster you drive, the less you break curfew? REX: I know this doesn't look good. CLARK: So you are aware of the curfew regulations? My brother-in-law just got released from a psychiatric hospital. - [ Tailgate opens ] - REYNOLDS: Back here. CLARK: You got any firearms in the vehicle? REX: No, sir. CLARK: I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle, sir. I'm just trying to get home to my wife. Step out of the vehicle, sir. BROOKLYN: Hello, Lilly. You remember the time we tried to run away from home? I think you were four, and I was something like nine. We had brought all our favorite clothes, but nothing even remotely warm enough for how cold it got that night. We thought we were set, remember? Temperature seemed to plummet. You made it half the way home. And I had to carry you the rest of the way. We both know that mom had been drinking, but it didn't matter. We knew she loved us the best way she knew how. Like it or not, that shitty little house was our home, and we knew it. You're the closest thing I have to a home now, Lilly. Which seems to be a bit of a problem because what I did is... ...is unforgivable. I grappled with that on the inside. 'Cause they preach forgiveness. And you really want to believe it. Hell, part of you might even buy in. All I need is a second chance. Who wouldn't want that? Then you get out here in the real world, and reality paints with a much more vivid brush. I am truly sorry for what I did, Lilly. And I will never ask you to forgive me for it if I can't forgive myself. How is it fair for me to ask you to? So on to plan B we go. [ Zipper unzips ] CLARK: How long you been militia, Mr. Yaleman? REX: I'm not. I'm telling you the truth. CLARK: I don't know what part of this situation makes you think it's okay to keep lying to me. Please, Officer, you have to believe me. REYNOLDS: We don't have to believe shit. Today is the two-year anniversary of my son's death. Stuck at the cabin. I'm just trying to get home! I'm begging you. I can't lose her. - REYNOLDS: I've heard enough. - You can't do this. God damn it! He knows things. REYNOLDS: That is enough. We have heard enough of your bullshit. WOMAN: I didn't get a hit after all, Officer Reynolds. Want to hear it? - Yeah, better be good. - He's not lying. His son, aged five, died in a house fire. Cause of death... arson. Were you lying about being on your meds, Brooklyn? I wasn't lying. The noise was gone for quite some time, actually. But maybe I got tired of nodding off every five minutes. It's ironic, huh? Damned if you do, damned if you don't. What are you talking about? BROOKLYN: What needs to be done. Nothing needs to be done, Brooklyn. Where do you keep his box? Whose box? Good try. In you go. - What are you doing? - In you go. - Come on. Come on. - Brooklyn, please. Move! Huh. You always were a step ahead of me, huh, Lil? Good for you. Harper's box. Where is it? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm running out of fucking patience, Lilly. Living room. Let's go. [ Tense music plays ] Why are you doing this? It's what we all want, whether we want to admit it or not. LILLY: Please. Please, I'm begging you. P-Please stop. [ Sobs ] You deserve this, Lilly. We all do. We all deserve a chance to finally put this behind us for good. Where is it? Lilly, come on. I saw the box. Quit playing dumb. Good girl. I'm right here. It's okay. [ Sighs ] It's time. [ Sniffles ] Time for what? You deserve a chance to finally move on. Lilly, come on. This is it. All you have to do is point it at me and squeeze the trigger. Harper deserves to know how much his mama loves him. Come on, you can finally take a stand against your pain right here, right now. This won't change anything. Yes. Yes, it will. It will. It has to. Lilly. Lilly. - Lilly. Shh, shh, shh, shh. - I won't do it. BROOKLYN: I need you. I need you to trust me. I need you to trust me. Lilly, you need this. I need you to trust me. Close your eyes and squeeze the trigger. I won't do it. I killed your son. Stop it. I killed your son, and he's never coming back. - Stop it! - He is never coming back. Stop talking! - It wasn't an accident! - Stop it! I know that you want to think that it was, - but that's just not true. - Shut up. - But it just wasn't. - [ Crying ] Stop talking. Lilly, he was asleep not 20 feet from where I set the drapes on fire. - Stop it. - I stood in the living room smiling while it all went up in flames around me. - Stop it! - Lilly, please. Please. I killed him. Okay? And I can't live with that anymore. I need you to do this. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me, Lilly, please. Please. BROOKLYN: I knew you'd finally show up. Just in time for the purging of the family disease. Are you okay? I told him we forgave him, but he won't listen. That's because it's bullshit! It's just not true. I killed your son. You can't forgive that. LILLY: It's not just your fault. We knew you weren't well, and we let you live with us anyway. REX: That's enough, Lilly. I was out for drinks with my girlfriends. No, no, no, no! None of that matters! - Yes, it does! - No. No, it doesn't. REX: You need to stop this now. You were in the house sleeping, and you couldn't even stop him. REX: Stop it, please! BROOKLYN: I was right. You never told her, did you? Told me what? - You didn't say anything? - No. Told me what, Rex? Told me what, Rex? REX: I wasn't sleeping in the house that night. I went into the shop to prep the next day's work. By the time I discovered the fire, it... It was too late, and... I never told you because I knew you could never forgive me. I couldn't risk losing you too. And I'm so sorry. What? What? What? What? Pick it up. Pick it up, or I will kill her. You already got what you came for, you sick fuck. Pick it up. Pick it up! LILLY: B.K., please. I will give you until the count of five. If you don't pull your trigger, I will pull mine. Put the fucking gun down, B.K. B.K., please don't do this. - BROOKLYN: Five. - Put the fucking gun down, B.K.! Four. Three. I love you. LILLY: No. No. BROOKLYN: Two. Don't make me do this. [ Gunshot ] [ Down-tempo music plays ]
