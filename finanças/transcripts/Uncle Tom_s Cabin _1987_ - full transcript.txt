HE GASPS DOGS BARK DOGS BARK AND SNARL Hyah! Hyah! Hey, down this way! Over here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't see nothing here. - Dogs lost the scent. - Whoa, whoa. Agh! Come on. Let's get out of here. Looks like a dead end. Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom, I heard the catfish were biting like crazy over at Willow Creek. Do you think that maybe tomorrow we could fetch up some bait? You've forgotten now. You're supposed to go to Bishop County tomorrow - to visit your cousin. - Clean forgot! - Next day, then? - We'll see. I'm starving to death, Aunt Chloe. All right, now. Sit yourself down. These corn-cakes will be ready in no time. Billy Leakin says Marcie makes better cakes than you do. - Hold on! - Oh, does he now? Well, if I make cakes the way Marcie does, I wouldn't be able to sleep all week. Marcie's cakes ain't no good at all. What you writing there, Tom? Your papa just sold off some more equipment. I'm just keeping the records here. See, I just got three... DOGS BARK A stranger coming. The dogs don't bark like that unless it's a stranger. BARKING CONTINUES Who's that? Looks like a trader fella. Could be a slave-trader. Here? A slave-trader? You know Papa wouldn't sell anyone here. I think you'll find Tom's quite exceptional. He's more than a driver. He practically manages all the field hands. And he's very pious. Good. I consider religion to be a - valuable thing in a nigger. - Mm-hm. Here you are. Much obliged. I think he should more than cover the balance of my debt. I need one more - a boy, girl - thrown in, that's all. I have none to spare, sir. Jimmy! Come here, boy. Where are your manners? INDISTINCT REPLY Bless his little heart. Shelby, this child would make someone a wonderful house pet. Throw in the boy. Settle our business right here. Jimmy? Jimmy, where have you... Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. I was looking for my little one. Excuse me, sir. By Jupiter, there's an article! You could make a fortune on her in New Orleans. I'm sorry. My wife wouldn't part with her for anything. Well, then so be it, but I've got to have that boy. Kind of sets a place off to have a handsome boy opening the door. Mr Haley, I would ask you, sir, not to take the boy from his mother. Hell, it's easy done. Give her some earrings. She'll make no fuss. - I implore you, sir. - The trouble with you Kentucky folk is you spoil your niggers. Throw in the boy, clear your debt. I don't believe it. Oh, yes, ma'am. He's a trader-man from New Orleans and he's looking to buy. You foolish, foolish girl. As if we'd sell any of our servants. That's a good girl. Now, cheer up. Yes, ma'am. Yes, that's it. Oh, that feels good. I can't help it, Emily. We're in no position to maintain this large a house! But not Tom! You already promised to give him his freedom one day. I'm sorry, he goes, and so does Eliza's little one. - Jimmy?! - Listen, this fella told me I could get a large sum of money for Eliza too, and I refused. How am I supposed to tell her we have sold her child?! It's done, Emily. I already signed the bill of sale. There's no point in going on about it. KNOCK ON DOOR Eliza! Has the boy took sick? I'm running away. - No! - I've got to. They sold my little Jim. Well, that's just crazy talk. It is not, it's the truth, I heard it myself. They sold him. That man who was here today is taking possession tomorrow morning, and that's not all. They sold you too, Tom. He sold you too. - What? - He sold you, Tom. It's for a debt. They've got to sell you, or lose everything else. Never! You said never! I'm leaving. I sure ain't gonna let them take my boy away. What about your husband? Eliza, you can't leave him. - George ran off. - George run away? His master, Mr Willis, got so mean he took to beating him every day, - so he ran off.Where? - Canada. - I'll be headed the same way. - It ain't right! None of it ain't right! I have to go right now. You've got to go too, Tom. I can't go. You've GOT to! If I go, then everybody here gets sold. And I can't do that. I can't let that happen. Master Shelby! Master Shelby! Jenny, what on earth are you shouting about? She's gone. Eliza. She took off with the boy! Oh... Thank God. Now, you tell me what the devil is going on here! Sir! Mrs Shelby is present. I will ask you to observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. Then get me a horse. You get me a horse now, I am going after that wench. Very well. Hey, Sam. Sam! We've got to slow things down. You know what, Andy? The old boy, he'll be looking mighty skitterish this morning. I sure hope he's ready for the job. ANDY LAUGHS Come on, boy. - Look alive! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We haven't got all day here. Catch that horse! We'll get him. He's never done this before. - I'm sorry. - What you staring at? You get yourself ready to leave, boy, cos I'm coming back for you just as soon as I catch this here wench. You understand? Come on, Jimmy. Come on, quick. Go on inside. See if anybody's at home. There she is! Get her! Get her! Jump, Jimmy! Gah! - You get in that water! - I can't swim. Get in! You! SHE SCREAMS Praise the Lord. Tom Loker. Tom Loker, is that you? Who's your friend? It's my partner, Mark. Well, now. I've got a nice proposition for you. If you see a wench, she's my property, she took her son across the river. I want her back. Bring him back to me, 10% on the profits. $50 flat down. It's unreasonable. 40. I know the catching trade. $50 is fair enough. Tom Loker, you got yourself a deal. Pa! Pa! They're coming back. - Right now! - Have they got Eliza? She ain't with them, Papa. Lord be praised. If I only know where you was going... That downriver place, ain't nobody ever return from there. Hush, now, Chlo. I'm coming back. As soon as the Shelbys get their money, they'll redeem me, they promised. They owed it to you already. Well, you can thank the Lord it's me being sold and not the children. Well, I don't take much comfort in that. Here, now, Chlo! God is still looking on. I know. It's just cos I love you so much, Tom. See, that's what I carry with me. They can't steal that. Can't nobody steal that. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah. Lord, hear my voice. Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou... Come on, boy, get in the wagon. Come on. Get in that wagon. Tom! I'm sorry. Mr Shelby, he just couldn't face you. Will you please tell Master Christopher goodbye for me? I assure you, sir, this sort of precaution is entirely unnecessary! Ma'am, I lost $500 on this place already. I ain't taking no more risks. All right. I love you. I love you, I love you all! Take good care of your mama. Hyah! - CHLOE: - No! No... SHE WAILS I'm gonna tell you right now what I tell all my niggers. Treat me fair, I treat you fair. Don't you be trying none of your tricks now, cos I'm onto every one of them. I've got an iron first to prove it. Just sit back, don't do nothing. WAGON RUMBLES Quick! Get behind this tree. You there! Can I help thee? Dear God. Oh, the poor creature. Whoa! Tom! Uncle Tom! I just got back home and they told me what happened. It's dirty mean, Tom. If only I was grown, I'd stop them somehow. I know, I know you would. Chains? Oh, Tom. What have they done to you? Where is he? Where's that dirty traitor? I'll knock him down. No, no, no, you could make it worse for my family and for yours. Look here, I brought you my lucky silver dollar, and Chloe told me to put a hole in it for a string so you can tie it around your neck. Keep it out of sight or they'll take it away from you. Bless your heart. I will. I'm coming after you, Tom. I'm gonna bring you back, I swear to God, I will. - I know you will. - Get on outta here. - Go on. - How can you chain people up like cattle? Have you got no shame? Ain't no worse than folks that sell them. - Just a business. - A dirty business. - Hyah! - Don't forget, I'll bring you back, Tom. I swear I will! I will, I promise! I truly do! Simeon, I didn't expect you be back. I have found two children of God. - What? - Please, they're weak from hunger. Now help me, please, hurry. We must hide them somewhere. They'll be looking for them. Oh, yes, of course. We'll keep them here and I will ask God and the elders for kindness. SHIP'S WHISTLE BLOWS Keep it moving back there. Come along now. Papa, why must they wear chains? It's to keep them from running away. Who would blame them for trying?

A song my mama taught me. It's awfully pretty. I'm glad you like it. - Want a whistle? - A whistle? Give it a try. Go ahead, it won't hurt you. There you go! - It's like a bird. - Ain't it so? - Where did you get it? - I made it. My name is Evangeline St Clare. That's a beautiful name. But everyone calls me Eva. My name is Tom. Where are you going? I don't know. Someone's gonna buy me, but I don't know who. My papa could buy you. I don't think that's likely. And we could have some really good times together. Your papa? Well, I guess if he's anything like you, I know I would. I'm gonna ask him, I'm gonna ask him this very day! Careful, now, Missy! SHE SCREAMS Help her! Help her! Help her! Help! Help me! Oh, my God! Eva! SHIP'S WHISTLE BLOWS Help her! Help her! It's my daughter! It's my daughter! Eva! Eva! Hold onto me! Eva! Oh, God, please help her. - Help her! - Throw me a rope! Somebody help that child! Hold on! I thank God I deal only in first-class slaves. Best stock money can buy. As a matter of fact, my little girl feels that this man has admirable qualities. Mm-hm. That he does. Therefore... ..I was wondering just how much you were prepared to cheat me? Well, sir, if I was to say 1,300, you'd be a lucky man. 1,300? That's out of your great respect for me. Exactly. Take a nigger his heft and build, worth considerably more. Listen, not only can he read, he's got a tolerable brain. You got his papers? Yes, sir. Right here. Signed by a previous owner? Mr Shelby. Tom, can you drive a team? I'm used to them. Well, then, we'll start you out on coach. That's a girl. That way, you can only get drunk one night a week. - I never drink, sir. - Oh, really? You're a more fortunate man than I am. You're gonna like it with us, Tom. Papa's good to everyone. Tom? It's a new life, Tom. A new life! Does thee still think, then, of going to Canada? Oh, yes. I must. Here. I have some tea for you. Thank you. You're very kind, all of you. I've never met folks like you before. Excuse me, ladies. I do not mean to intrude, but I do believe I have good news for thee. - For me? - Did thee say thy husband's name is George? - It is. - There's a man staying in the house of a Mr Wilson in Rutersville. A very good man. I do believe thy husband has been hiding there. George? Hmm. - Well, is he there now? - No, no, this man who may be your husband has arrived at the settlement. Oh, Lord. Where? He's right here. George... Oh, George! Augustine? Augustine, can you hear me? What are you doing out there? Come on in. Augustine, I can't take Mammy no longer. Oh, I tell you, these slaves are the plague of my life. I truly believe my ill health is caused by them more than any other thing. Mammy has been devoted to you for a long time. She sleeps so soundly at night she don't hear me at all. She knows I'm not feeling well. And I need little attentions, nearly every hour. Good morning, Marie. Cousin Augustine. Cousin Ophelia. I trust you slept well? - Wonderful. - What I wouldn't give for a good night's sleep. Eva, my darling. Careful now, don't muss Mama's hair. Can I take care of you tonight, Mama? - Whatever for? - I heard you up last night. I just want to help. Oh, you sweet angel! Mammy will take care of me. I don't think Mammy's feeling too well. Oh, nonsense, she's as strong as a horse. Papa, can I have a ride to the carriage? OK. Come on. Piggy back. That's a girl. Here we go! Ready? EVA WHINNIES Why don't you let Eva help you? She's such a peculiar child. Always disposed to spend time with the servants. Of course, I used to play with my father's little Negroes. Never did me any harm. But Eva, she treats them like equals. Frankly, I wouldn't want the responsibility of having slaves for anything in the world. Of course, they ought to be flogged occasionally. They get so dreadfully lazy without it. I would take care of Mammy myself... if it were not for my feeble health. SHE SCOFFS Arthur! Did Chloe tell you? She got a letter from Tom. - Good! - Apparently, he was purchased by a fine family. I'm very glad to hear that. But he still wants to come home. Emily... I have 18 creditors, right and left. There is no way I can get the money... Excuse me. But I MUST talk. - What is it, Chloe? - A bakery man, over Louisville, said he needed a good hand. Said he'd be paying $4 a week. If I could go for a while, I could get the money that's needed for Tom. But your children? The children are old enough to take care of themselves. I want to go. I want to go. All right, you have our permission. $4 a week. You know how long it's gonna take you? About five years. However, we shall add something to it when we can... to shorten the time. God bless you, missus. I'll be taking my leave in the morning, then. Excuse me. Aunt Chloe! Aunt Chloe, what did they say? Boy, I'm going to Louisville. I'm going to Louisville. I wish I could do something too. You can, boy, you write Tom, you tell him all about it. Tell him day's coming here. Oh, the day's coming. Ophelia. Ophelia! I brought you a present! I brought you a surprise. Good heavens. She's all yours to train and educate properly. See this lady right here? She's gonna be your new mistress. So you behave yourself now, all right? Yes, master. My dear cousin, I can't... No, you can't refuse. Well... It's going to be uphill work, I'm afraid. This little girl has been beaten every day of her life. All she needs is just a little bit of my New England cousin's upbringing. All right? What is your name, child? - Topsy. - Topsy, indeed. Well, first thing's first. Hold her down! That's it. Give her a good scrub! Stay still, I said! Friend George. My friend here, Phineas Fletcher, has discovered something of importance. At the tavern, I heard two men talking. They spoke of thee, friend George, and of returning thee to thy master, and of making an example of thee. - George! - And of returning thy child to the Negro dealer, Mr Haley. These men were soon joined by three others. We must leave right away. We shall escort thee. No, I couldn't ask. A driver is needed. I know the road. Do not ask, for it is given. "Aunt Chlo is hired out to a baker in Louisville. "Her skill in pastry will gain the money some day for your redemption. "Your boys tell me that they miss you very much." Oh, Tom, how I wish they could see you. But how wonderful of Christopher to send you this letter. He's a fine fella. Tom, look over there. See how the light shines? And I saw a sea of glass mingled with fire. - Canaan's shore. - Where do you suppose it is, Tom? Over there in the clouds. I've seen them, the bright angels. They come in my sleep sometimes. Honestly. Tom? Yes? - I'm going there. - What? What are you talking about? I AM going there, Tom, I am. How old are you? Don't know. Who is your mother? Never had none. - Where were you born? - Never was born, I was raised...by a speculator. A what? Speculator. He buys them up cheap when they's little. Oh, Topsy. Have you ever heard about God? Do you know who made you? Nobody as I knows of. We are going to have our very first lesson. Now, then, what's that? My ribbon. That I keep on my dresser. You stole it. Me? No, missus, that ribbon must have caught up in my sleeve. I never did see it till this blessed - minute. - Stand up! What else have you stolen? If you confess, I won't whip you this time. Well? I stole Miss Eva's red thing she wears around her neck. Her necklace? You bring it here! Now! Aunt Ophelia! I just thought I heard someone crying out. This wicked, wicked child has stolen your red necklace. That isn't possible. I have it on. Why in the world did you tell me you stole it? Cos you wanted to know what I took and I just couldn't think of anything, so, to please you, I made up the red thing. What am I to do with you? Whip me, ma'am. Oh, no! No, you mustn't! SHE COUGHS My dear, my dear. Are you all right? I shall return this ribbon that you stole from me to my dresser. But we shall certainly keep a sharp eye on you in the future. Topsy, why do you need to steal? Need to? I'd rather give you anything of mine than have you steal it. You would? Here. Take it. I give it to you. Don't want it, no ways. Morning, Master St Clare. I got it. Whoa. Whoa. Tom, I'd like to have a word with you. As you can see, the wasteful expenditures of this place are becoming quite a concern to me, so I would like you to assist me in the farm management. What's the matter? You don't look like you're pleased. You look as solemn as a funeral. - What's wrong? - Last night, they had to carry you home again. Yeah, I know. You're talking about that demon whisky. It can hurt you, see? It can hurt your family. I know, I know. I'm just gonna have to... I'm gonna have to try harder to abstain in the future, that's all. Hey, Tom. I promise. I will. Come on. Look, look, there they are, the men who are pursuing thee. Over there, it's that nigger! They've seen us! They're gonna catch up! Indeed. Then let's stop here, on the ridge. Down, get down. - I have a pistol. - They are welcome to it, friend George. If there is to be a fight, let it be here on the high ground. May I have the pleasure of looking on? MEN SHOUT They can get ugly, you know. They're too scared. Niggers are too scared to fight. You! Down there! My name is George Harris! I am a free man standing on God's free soil and I claim my wife and my son - as my own. - You come down from there. I'm armed to defend myself. The first person that comes within range is a dead man. And the next and the next and so on, until the last. Don't waste his time talking. They're worth just as much dead as alive. George! - George! - I'm all right. - Get down! - George, I think, perhaps, thee had better stay out of sight with thy speechifying. They are mean. I heard a squeal up there. - Yeah, me too. - Let's take them. Stop! I think thee has found thy mark. HE GROANS Get him! Go on, get him! The devil we will! If you want him, then you get him. I've had about enough of this. Now, you wait just a minute here! Leave him be! Come on, boys, let's clear out of here. Ah, good. Thee has won the day, friend George. The wagon is thine. I shall get back on my own. Where will thee go, friend George? North, to Canada, to freedom. - God be with thee. - And with you, friend Phineas. We'll say our prayers for the Quakers as long as we live. But why can't we teach them all to read? That's a silly question. They haven't the intelligence. Tom can read. He reads his Bible every day. But, my darling, reading does not teach him to work any better. And they're really not meant for anything else. I don't believe that. You are such an odd child. Ophelia's teaching Topsy to read. It's a waste of time. Oh, my darling, look here. One day, these pearls are gonna be yours, to wear at your coming-out party. Aren't they lovely? I wore those to my very first ball. I was a sensation. Are they... SHE COUGHS My dear. Are they worth a good deal of money? Oh, I should say so, a small fortune. I wish I could have them right now. Why? So I could buy a school. A place in the free states where the slaves could learn to read - and write. - Oh, my dear little Eva. Such a foolish child. You don't know anything at all about these things. I must say, all this talking about slaves is making my head ache. I'm sorry, Mama. - I'll come back later. - Yes. There's a good girl. I'm worried about Eva too. Good heavens, why? Haven't you noticed? She has a dreadful cough. She's growing. Sometimes when children grow too fast, that's what happens. These things always begin with a cough. My dear little niece, Sue Ellen, was taken in a matter of weeks. It was just a cough at first. Ophelia, spare me the hobgoblin nurse stories. The child has a cough. That does not mean death is at hand. Augustine, I still say... And I still say that you take care of Topsy, and I'll take care of Eva. I had no idea that the stock were consuming so much feed. Well, sir, it's no problem. The land we've got in corn is yielding all we need. You haven't been riding the horse too hard, have you, my darling? - No, Papa. - You know, it's not good for you to ride too fast. Oh, but I like riding so much. I know. Topsy. It's all right. Come in. Tell me something, Topsy. Haven't you ever had anyone to love? Me? I guess the last place... Ophelia can love you, Topsy, if only you were good. Oh, no. Miss Ophelia can't bear me. She'd rather have a toad touch her. Can't nobody love us niggers. So I don't care anyways. I love you, Topsy. I do, honestly. And it would mean so much to me if you would just try to be good. I do so dearly love you. I will try, I swear to you. COUGHING CONTINUES Ophelia. - It's true. - What's true? What's the matter? Topsy. She said that I can't bear to have her touch me. I didn't think she knew it. Leave it to a child, they will find out every time. Whoa! Stay in the wagon. Keep very quiet. Hello! Hello! Excuse me, sir. My name is George and that's my family in the wagon. We've come a very long way and we were told you might be able to take us in for a spell. If I'm mistaken, I ask your forgiveness, sir, and we shall leave. Thee will not, sir. Bring in thy family at once. Thank you for coming so quickly. It's quite all right. She's in the second bedroom here. I reckon the child has a cold, and that's all. Give me a moment with her alone. Really, I don't see anything that ails the child at all. - Her cough is persistent. - You don't need to tell me about a cough, I have been afflicted with a cough my whole life. Night after night, Mammy would sit up with me when I was Eva's age. I know, dear, but little Eva really is feeling very ill. It's a nervous affliction, that's all it is. I've had the same thing my whole life. You see, Augie, the thing is, she's... Her lungs are filled with fluid, it could be very serious. Oh, how cruel. How very cruel. Here I am in the most wretched health and now my only darling child is going down into the grave before my very eyes. - What can we do? - Rest. Absolute rest. - That's all? - That's all we know of. ♪ Oh, sinners ♪ Sinners, what you gonna do when the Lord sounds his trumpet? ♪ Gonna run, run, run, run, run to my Lord ♪ Gonna run, run, run, run to my Lord ♪ Oh, will you be waiting... ♪ What is that? Tom. He's singing. Well, make him stop. He's taking Eva out to the arbour. Oh, dear God, is that wise?

She say... She say that she is sorry that her leaving won't stop OUR misery. She's got it, Tom. That child's got the mark of the Lord on her forehead. I know. And there's something in her eyes. Something deep. Blessed little lamb. Here, I fixed you something. I'm sorry. I just can't. You'd better go in now. My angel. Papa... Dear Papa. Oh, my God. It's over. It's over now. THEY SOB Miss Ophelia said you wanted to see me. Tom, please, come on in. Tom, I've started proceedings... ..to grant you your enfranchisement. In other words... ..I'm gonna make you a free man. Lord God. I'll sign the papers on Friday and that'll be the end of the matter. You can pack your bag and head on back to Kentucky. Oh, my God. Don't look in such rapture. Have I really been that bad? It's being free, don't you see? A free man. That was Eva, Tom. When she died, she made me promise that I'd let you go... ..and I would never, ever break that promise, as long as I live. Miss Eva was a messenger from the Lord. Yeah. I... I truly think she was. Augustine. could I... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just leaving, Miss Ophelia. (I'm free.) What's that he said? He said he was free. You mean, you... I mean I've known two genuine saints in my life. I've lost one. And I'm about to lose the other. Oh, my dear cousin. Thank you. Free, Lord. Free! HE CHUCKLES What? Get him! Agh! Put him down. There! Stabbed in a drunken brawl! It's a family disgrace! He's dying. Tom... I'm right here. Heavenly Father, please take this poor sinner into thy bosom and love him as we have loved him here on Earth. Amen. Oh! SOBBING I don't know how you stand it. Marie... It's these awful black mourning dresses. If Augustine only knew how we were suffering. I must talk with you about Tom. Tom? Augustine promised Tom his freedom before he died. If Tom told you that, he's lying. No, Augustine told me himself. Oh. Well... It's absolutely impossible. Tom's the most valuable servant we've got. Besides, what does he want of liberty? He's better off as he is. He does want his freedom. He was promised it. He simply doesn't know what's best for him. Augustine made this promise to Eva on her deathbed. How can you possible disregard it?! Everyone... Everyone goes against me! Bringing up these old promises when I have so much to bear! Have you no feeling for me, Ophelia? It's really so inconsiderate. Marie, Tom deserves his freedom. I don't wanna hear any more about it. The servants will be sold, all of them. It's final. - Topsy is mine. - What? Topsy is mine, thank God. Augustine signed her over to me. That little baggage, I couldn't care less. I'm taking her north with me. Good riddance. Oh, of course I didn't mean you, my dear. Faster. Faster. Tom... I heard it, Tom. I heard them all talking. They are going to sell us. They're really going to sell us. Every last one. Well, now, Missy. Looks like old Tom has got to move on again. But don't you worry, because I'm going back home someday. Back to Kentuck'. Do you know that? Of course you do. Sweet, sweet child. EXCITED CHATTER Gentlemen, gentlemen, I beseech you!

Does thee find him well disguised? Too well, Mrs Smiley. Oh, I'm sorry. But it is said in the village that the slave catchers might try to stop a negro couple with a small boy if they go to cross the river into Canada. Indeed, they will not see them. Come on.

When he's sound asleep, I'm going to give him enough brandy to keep him out all night. There's an axe in the cellar and I'll have the door to his room open. You can do it, Tom. He deserves to die. Would you sell your soul to the devil for that? What do you want me to do, pray some more? Well, I can't eat or pray. You see... all I can do is hate and cuss. Don't you see, Tom? That's all that's left inside me. It's all I've got. Be still. You run. Run for your life. Because without faith, you'll not survive this hell. God be with you. But you said we can't make it, you said there's no escape in the woods. We won't be in the woods. Where we going to be? Here. Right here. I don't understand. Upstairs in the garret, it's over the house. He won't go near that place. He's scared. - Why? - One night he... He killed somebody up there. And ever since then, he hears voices and noises in his head. We'll be safe there. - For how long, though? - Long enough. He'll get them dogs out and put on a big search for us. When they think we've disappeared But they'll see us. I want them to see us. They'll chase us to the woods and we'll circle around and come back to the house. Oh, Cassy, you've got it all planned. I don't know if I can do it. You can do it. You'd better do it. Master! Master, they's gone, they's gone! Who's gone? Miss Cassy and Miss Emmy. They've gone off in them there woods. $5! $5 for the one who catches them first. - Now, you get going, boy! - Yes. Go on, boy, you get 'em! You get 'em, boy. Go on! - Master, we've been here before. - Huh? We're making circles. Them dogs are leading us back to the house. You're right. These dogs have lost the scent. Those girls, they've gone north. Come on, bring them this way! Come on. Go to the house and get them torches. We'll be out here half the night. What are we doing in the sitting room? We've got to get back up to the garret - it's dark already. We've got plenty of time. As long as the Greek thinks we're still out there, he'll track us down until we drop. Right now, I'm looking for something to pay for our passage. Money. You'd steal from him? He stole it, didn't he? Off our sweat. Well, he won't see this money again. Now, let's get some food and go up to the garret. Are you sure he won't go up there? I told you, he's scared. Ghosts. Miss Cassy, if we get away, don't leave me. Oh, dear child. DOGS MOAN Hush, dogs. Quiet, boy. Go to sleep right now. Master, I'll put the dogs down for the night. DOGS BARK He's back. Come on! Quick, quick! Goddamn! Well, now. Here he is. Good morning to you, Tom. Did you have a good sleep? Or, like me, were you... worrying about them two girls? I have made up my mind that I'm going to kill you unless you tell me what's happened to them. Now, maybe you don't believe me. Maybe you think that your master wouldn't throw away that kind of money. But I assure you, boy, I am sincere. Sin-cere. So, you hear me? Speak up, come on, speak up. Nothing to tell. Boy, I have counted the cost, and I am determined to break you once and for all right now. I am going to take every drop of blood you've got. I asked you, do you hear me? Well... You take my blood... that is nothing. No. You can hurt me no more. Well, now... we'll see, huh? Master, he can't go on. Ain't no use to go on. Yep, I do believe he's done for. Well, at least he stopped his mouth from preaching, and that is a comfort. Quimbo, I think we gone done a wicked thing, cos I ain't never felt like this before. Oh, we done near killed him. He breathing! Oh, Lord Jesus, forgive us. Get him down. Come on. GLASS SMASHES SHE GROANS BOTTLE SMASHES GROANING CONTINUES No! Whoa! I wish to speak to Mr Legree. He's in the house. Well, take me to him. Master. Master, there's somebody here. My name is Christopher Shelby. I understand that you purchased a man by the name of Tom from an auction. He used to belong to my father and I'm here now to buy him back. Buy him back?! I fail to see the humour in this request. HE COUGHS What do you want with them? That nigger is a curse to the world. Got my two girls to run away. $800 worth just run away. And then just stood there as though it had nothing to do with him. Well, sir, I'll tell you, he's got himself a flogging now as will kill him yet. Where is he? He in the shanty, sir. - I'll show you. - You shut up! Take me there. I said take me! Take him, take him. Tom? Oh, my God, Tom! It's me, Christopher. Don't you recognise me? Chris? It's you? Oh, Lord. What have they done to you, Tom? They... I'm here to buy you back, Tom. I'm going to take you home. Home? That's right. I can't. I can't do that now. I'm going to the glory now. You tell Chloe... Tell her that I love her. I will, Tom. I surely will. But you can tell her yourself. Tom? Tom, please, don't. Don't die now, Tom. I'm free. I'm free. Tom? Tom... Tom. Tom! You be careful now. Careful. I want you to know I'm going to report this to the first law officer I see. Oh, now, you do that. Who're you going to have as a witness? What's all the fuss about? Just one more dead nigger. You put chains on all your slaves, sir? Yes, son. Well, I ain't got no chains on right now, and neither do you. What you talking about? This. 'Uncle Tom was right. 'Only his body died at the hands of Simon Legree. 'Tom's spirit rose out of the pages of Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel 'to agitate the conscience of a nation. 'A war was fought. The black people were legally freed. 'Today, 120 years later, 'the battle for true freedom still continues.' ♪ Stand the storm ♪ It won't be long ♪ We'll anchor by and by ♪ Stand the storm ♪ It won't be long ♪ We'll anchor by and by ♪ My ship is on the ocean ♪ We'll anchor by and by ♪ King Jesus is my captain ♪ We'll anchor by and by. ♪ ♪ Well, I'm tramping ♪ Tramping ♪ Trying to make heaven my home ♪ Well, I'm tramping ♪ Tramping ♪ Trying to make heaven my home ♪ Well, I journey through the wilderness all night long ♪ Trying to make heaven my home ♪ Come on, children Help me to sing our song ♪ Trying to make heaven my home ♪ Well, I'm tramping ♪ Tramping ♪ Trying to make heaven my home. ♪ Subtitles by Ericsson
