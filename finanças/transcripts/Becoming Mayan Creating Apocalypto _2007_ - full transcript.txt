[birds chirping] We had the sense that we were on a frontier of... ...Of doing things that had not been done before. [indistinct chatter] There are so many elements to make something happen. The people we work with were fantastic and understood the vision. [man] When we"d looked at the world of the Maya there was some fascinating aspects of that culture. [child laughing] How they lived, their religious beliefs, what their spiritual world looked like. Their customs, what were they doing in terms of their ceremonies? There was a need for the audience to feel that they"re watching something real. They had to buy into the story from the moment they saw the characters on the screen. We talked to a lotta people, uh, archeologists and professors, and there was a lot of reading to be done. That was interesting. The social morays, the customs, their beliefs. And be very proud. Very sophisticated civilization, at the same time very brutal. That beats a couple times. Then he takes away... Stay up and try and watch it go. [crowd cheering]j [man] We did a lot of location scouting, huge amounts. We went to Guatemala. We went to Costa Rica. My biggest memory of Costa Rica is Mel"s back, because we just kept walking through these jungles and forests, track after trail after track. Looking everywhere, everywhere, and try to find the right place to shoot. But, uh, the jungle there was too thick, and we couldnt see into it. [man speaking Spanish] What I needed for a film like this was some level area that you could swing a cat in with flat areas and places where you could build sets. [Gibson] Action! And so Mel went to Mexico, but I didn"t go with him. And he went to see this jungle there that he"d been told about by Anna Roth, who is the production manager on the film. [Wwomanl It was basically jungle. They wanted jungle, and the fact that it was Mayan made it logical to... To be sort of like put together in Mexico. [Gibson] There. Bang, bang, bang, bang. [Safinial He went to see this piece of jungle. He called me and said, "Dude, I! found it. I found the jungle." I said, "Wow, cool. What" it"s like?" And he goes, "Its beautiful." - [indistinct chatter] - [Gibson] Action! [Safinial] Its flat, so we can do all the chase stuff we wanna do. We can have our actors run through it. - [Man] Cool. Thats great. - [clapping] [Safinial The best thing about it is you can see deep into this jungle. And it"s got these huge trees, and they really create the scenes. I mean, they really add to the atmosphere. There"s a serenity to it. In Mexico we were able to find primary rainforests, really impressive stuff. I mean, if you saw, these trees were amazing. - [man yelling in Mayan] - That was beautiful. [Safinial We chose Catemaco, the village that was near this piece of jungle, as our base for the next five, six months. Your"re there for those two exchanges. I wanna see you smiling and enjoying it. OK, and action. [Roth] We started with a small group in the jungle where the reguirements were not so big. We had a normal crew. And then, as we approached the city, in order to fulfill the needs of the visual concepts as far as wardrobe, makeup, hair, it just became big, big, big. - [-rowd cheering]j - [drums beatingj [Roth] Werre talking 700 extras... Seven hundred extras is not such an outstanding figure, but the visual concept is so complicated that each one of these extras has a makeup person, a hair person and a wardrobe person. And if you multiply it by 700 that is a lot of people. I suggested to Tom Sanders, "What about doing the city in a bigger place, someplace where I could house all the people that were reguired." [Safiniajl We moved to Veracruz, where we had built the city set. The camera"s going past you, you just... [groans, coughing] [Safinial There"s a tremendous effort being made for it to be real. Some people say, "Well, you could do it all in the CG, or you could do it all in models," you know, uh, but really, Mel said, "Well, you know, I need to have a city there. I! need to see something." - He can turn from side to side. - He can kinda, more or less, control... [Gibson] Well, it had to be practical. You had to be able to walk people through and march "em up stairs. Look at "em from down the bottom and have things roll down, and so, uh, there was a lotta work reguired for that. Took a long time. [Safiniaj]l And Tom Sanders, production designer, who had worked with Mel before on Braveheart came on, very early on, and decided to build this city for us. Something that will never be seen in film again, that you may have seen way back in the great Cecil B. DeMille epics or Cleopatra or like, uh, Ben-Hur or whatever it may be. Where the actual Mayan city that we are shooting in was mostly constructed right there before our very eyes. The huge pyramid temples and the marketplace. When you actually see that marketplace seguence youlll almost, I think, be able to smell it off the screen, it looks so real. It"s like a time machine here. These elements, the shanty town, the terraced fields that youlll see, the lime guarry, and the tree fall. [Gibson] Action! [screaming] [Safinia] Everything you see in this film were actual, real elements we shot. The main components of the city were designed and built there for us on set and maintained for months like that. - [ali cheeringj - [drums beatingj - [man laughing] - [Whistling] Frank on drums. [Gibson] The real sets were the way to 90, and people had a real sense that they were in a place. I mean, it was awesome to walk in there. Even empty. You"d walk in there, and you"d g0, "Woo." [Safinia] I remember when we shot the village scene where the storytellers telling his story. That that was the first time during the shoot when everybody came to the set. [man] Hey gyys, start clearing, please. GCuiet all around. - Wer"re ready to shoot. - [man 2] All cameras set. [Safinial The storytellers telling his story, and when he finishes this music starts to happen. [drums beating]j [Safinial And then people slowly get up and dance. And then you see Mel, in the middle, conducting it. "OK, now you, slowly rise. Now tell... Start to dance. Now you gyys stand up. And now you move." I remember everybody crowded around the monitor staring at this scene. [indistinct shouting] [Roth] That was a big opportunity and a big responsibility. - [chanting] - [yelling unintelligibly] [Gibson] You see these images, or a way of looking at something thats exciting. Its kind of a magic thing. It"s so vivid, um, so defined, so beautiful. [Gibson] Cut. It was perfect. [clapping] [man] We have ceramics and sculpture and monuments that give us an idea of what the Maya were doing, how they were dressed, the types of jade ornaments they were wearing, tattooing and scarification on their faces, on their bodies. It was a method of display. There was a lot of elegance. Even the way they chose to see themselves. You"re showing yvourselves off. You wanna be seen. Very elegant, very stylized. [woman] The Mayans had many styles of beauty. Looking good for the others was an obligation. More. - For her? - Yeah. [Rubeo] There"s a lot of information on how the Mayans wore their empire. The challenging thing was how to interpret all this. [Safinial] In this film you"ve got the rich. You"ve got the young people, the old people, the very poor. There are all these different stratas of society. Wouldnrt it be great if you could visually convey that just through costumes? I think the reality is that Mel, as the creative force behind this film, allowed his key crew members the luxury, the freedom, to go out there and come up with beautiful, creative things, and they did it. Amazing. Amazing. [Gibson] The costumer is a young woman called Mayes Rubeo from Mexico. She brought designs in and showed me pictures that were exciting and whetted my appetite to see more. I knew that she had a spirit of adventure and wanting to get in and do something really striking. lindistinct cheering]j Vvve never seen work like it, and rve seen a lot. That King"s costume... and the Gueen... Some of these Chacs and Holcanes with these masks on. I mean, it"s, wow, that:s amazing. To set all the different tones that we wanted to use, we made samples of all these colors from natural vegetables and animals that the Mayans used. For example, this beautiful red sienna comes from rojo cochinilla, and it gives you a variety of degrees of this kind of red. We also used indigo-blue. So many hues in one single feather. And we actually were able to recreate a green that comes from bladders of animals. We"re making costumes that nobody"s ever done. The prints that you see have to be recreated because they did it freehand. We did about 50 different designs. Patterns and embroidery that they have from those times. Every single thing that you see in this movie is hand-sewn, handmade. You cant get any shortcuts, "cause were shooting five cameras all the time. It has to be perfect. The Mayans use a lot jade. It was a symbol of wealth and happiness and trade and trust. But for logistic reasons we couldn"t have all these made out of jade, so we had to learn how to paint all these like materials into jade, just hand-painting them. All these bits are wood. We have to make it look like if it was jade. And it looks beautiful, just like jade. The Maya viewed status through the use of jade, exotic commobdities like shell, mother-of-pearl. [indistinct shouting] One of the most obvious things was the use of jade ear spools. They would perforate the earlobe, put a small piece of jade in, and gradually expand that until it"s able to accommodate a large ornament. The things that are very, very original in this film stem from the fact that Mel, as an artist and as a filmmaker, is at a place where he can take those chances. Some of the things youlll see in this film, you"ll never have seen before. [drums beating] [man] The costume that I wear is so mythic it belongs in every culture of a warrior society. As soon as I put all of that leather armor on I completely just... [sputters] You know, become this character. It"s like, "Oh, my God, what is this? Is this an animal or a man?" There"s no work reguired other than to wear the costume. Raul, signal those guys to move out. [Trujillo] It"s like Mel says, "You dont have to be scary. You are scary." Try to look straight out with your face. I mean, it is so ominous. This is not a normal movie. It is a big makeup and hair movie. - [speaking Spanish] - Today. [speaking Spanish] My department is guite big. Probably it"s the biggest I! have ever had in my life, like 250 people. Details are so important. Even though you dont see it, you feel it. This has really been a big challenge. [Sodano] They start to see every single drawing, what they used to have, uh, for ears and earrings, for nose bridges, for tattoos, and everything which is makeup. Our first thinking was, uh... How can we make the public understand who they are? Everything they used to do in their life was for the gods. In fact, every single tattoo is a sign of a religion. [Gibson] They had a concept of afterlife and a concept of life as it related to afterlife. The behavior that they"d exhibit because of that... They had a concept of paradise and damnation and sin. [speaking Mayanj Village people. They"re people that live with nothing. We"d been very minimal with tattoos and things. [Gibson] OK, cut. [Signoretti] With the middle class I went a little more tattoos, hairdos. We also get rich people and high class people, but then when you put it all together, you see this difference between. Each person looks different. [Safinial You"ve got these beautiful ladies with the jade teeth who are using their fans and laughing and smiling. You can tell there"s something different about them. Maybe you say something to her, and you laugh. [speaking indistinctly] [Sodano] The material we use for the earlobes is a silicon, because the earlobes are stretched. I could not use something hard. I need to have, uh, movements. [chanting indistincetly] Another very important thing was the Mayan Perfida. The real Mayans have kernels. Its a particular Mayan nose, - the original Mayan look. - That"s great. That was one of the first guestions, "You mind wearing a prosthetic nose?" AII the makeup, the scarifications, the tattoos, the various piercings were applied to the actors every single day. Morning after morning these busloads of extras would come in, and there were rows of makeup chairs with mirrors and red lights above them. Every time a new makeup chair d become clear then the red light would come on. There"s an AD going, "OK, you, go there." On the biggest days we had 200 and some odd makeup artists working on hundreds and hundreds of extras. [Gibson] Action! [Sodano] You see them all together. The richest one to the poorest one is made up with tattoos, with scarification. Yeah, that"s it, Rudy. Stay like that. AII of them have to be different, because we know the way that Mel shoots. Close-ups on every single extra, and they are marvelous. Dont hit him hard. Still miss him, - but you can make a little contact. - OK. [grunts] There was something exciting in terms of being able to come up with weapons that people had never seen before. Simon Atherton is a world class armorer. Every film you"ve seen that the weapons in it are cool, Simon Atherton probably supplied the weapons. - [(Atherton] There you go. - [Gibson] Thats amazing. Staggering. Hess a favorite. Particularly when it comes to primitive weaponry. So you were going for fish hunter, right? Rudy got by you. Itt:s like pig and farmer, you know. So youre chasing him back. T"ve worked with Mel before. Il worked with him on Braveheart, and it was one of the first big feature films I did. He doesnrtt just limit his activity to, you know, being the armorer or the weapons gyy or the designer. He s really creative with some of these things. For example, that frog and blow darts, and says, "Watch this." He had this little dart that he made, with some 0O-Tips and a straight pin. He just grabs a piece of paper and rolls it up and goes... [spits] It went whap! And he says, "What if he uses a leaf?" There"s whimsy in it. [Safinial He came to this film wanting to strike that perfect balance between historical accuracy and things that just looked cool. First you figure out what tools and materials they"ve got. From that you can figure out what kind of weapons they"d have. [Safinia]l We knew that the Mayans didn"t have any metal. What they used was obsidian, which is a very hard, very sharp kind of glass mineral that would cut through anything. [Gibson] Hey! The edge on it is just horrific. And then it made a fantastic sword. This is an obsidian sword. Not many of these things have survived. lindistinct screaming]j And this would be a very sharp cutting edge. - Itts got obsidian blades on it? - Yeah. These things were studded with obsidian. Could inflict serious damage. And it was brutal. It was amazing. It was... glass is gonna shatter, but it doesnt. They also used that kind of material for their sacrificial knives. They could cut and slash, get inside a man"s ribcage within seconds. If you imagine, that"s the last thing you see as itts coming towards you. [crowd cheering]j In this film, people arent attacking only. They"re going out to take prisoners, so we had to invent weapons that not only killed people, but stunned people. [shouting in Mayanj You"ll see some weapons dont have obsidian on both sides like this sword. They will have it on one side, and that"d be to inflict a stunning blow rather than a killing blow. [groaning] [Safinia] These are the weapons and technigues the Mayans had. It was accurate, historically. Here they were being seen, for the first time, on film. - [speaking Mayanj]j - [screaming] Cut! As you look at the guantity and the extent and the caliber of the artistic merit that the Maya had, it breeds a sense of respect, a sense of awe, and a sense of understanding. From the moment the film starts to the moment it ends you feel like youre transported into this world that you are seeing very much, primarily, through visual means of communication. And what ends up happening is that you buy it more. You really believe these people. You think that those are the actual Mayans, and we just took a camera and happened to shoot this fantastic action story in the real world. To pull all these things together into a film with huge moving parts is amazing to watch. Thats what filmmaking"s about. [Gibson] It was exciting to look at, it looked dynamic. That it was odd, something so strange to look at, what people thought of as beautiful or what they wish to adorn. GCuite frankly, one started off with that, "Why"d they think of that?" By the time you finished looking at "em, they were beautiful. I know why they did that. It had this aesthetic that began to appeal to me. And it looks beautiful on film. And it fills you with wonder.
