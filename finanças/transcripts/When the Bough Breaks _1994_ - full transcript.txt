♪ Here we go ♪ ♪ Here we are, here we go ♪ - Raise it up. Easy. - Watch it. - Over here. - Steady it. - Captain Swaggert can you give us a statement please? - Not now. - Can you tell us what you found here? - Do you want to move the line back a ways Captain? - Can't make 'em go away Jimmy. - I'd just as soon turn a hose on 'em. - No need for that tonight is there? - Captain. - Sam what do you got? - We've checked with every hospital and lab in the area. There ain't no record of any dumping or disposal like this. - Who found it? - A couple of kids sportsing around near the pipe. - Well don't let 'em get away before we get a chance to interview 'em. - Yep. - Thank you, Sam. Morning gentlemen. - Howdy Captain. Must be serious when they get you out of bed. - Did all of these come out of that same bag? - Yes sir, all but the one the kids found. - So it wasn't sealed up? - Not quite. - Jimmy you better call my home, tell Helen I probably won't get back before dawn. - It looks like we can expect more rain for the rest of the day and things will be cleared up by late tonight. So don't forget your umbrellas on the way out. Looks like the forecast for tomorrow, it's partly cloudy skies and clearing hot and humid. Temperatures should be up in the 90s. Sounds like a good day to stay inside with the air conditioner on. - Hey Jim. - Morning Captain. - Morning boys. Belvin. - Sir? - I want the whole forensics team in here this morning. - Well Vince just got back from the examiner's office. He's gonna hold the night shift over until Frankie and Scolia get down. - Good deal. Foot, I want you to coordinate two diver teams on standby and make sure damn they know what they're getting into down there. - Yes sir. Six feet of rapidly moving excrement. - Get that for me would you? - What if this rain keeps up Captain? - Well we're gonna have to start building an ark. - Yeah but who do we put on it? - All the white people. - It's Pete Sweeny, channel six. He wants to know about the numbers on the hands. - Well you tell him they have to wait for a press release like everyone else. - Did you hear that Pete? Yeah just call back later. - What else did he want? - Just smelling around for more news. - Speaking of news, I got an announcement for you. The assistance chief has called in an outside profiler on this one. - What FBI? - No, state crime division. - Lesser of two evils. - She'll be coming in here sometime today. - Whoa, she? - Special investigator Audrey L. Macleah, all the way from Austin. - And what's so special about her? - Oh, she's a state trooper man. You know what it takes to crack that boys' club? - Yeah, you gotta have a mustache and no neck. - You mean she looks just like you. - What's she gonna do around here anyway, except look over our shoulder? - She's gonna save us from ourselves. - Suspect profiling, computer modeling, victimology, databased analysis, forensics, trace evidence, chemical evidence retrieval, blood pattern analysis. Y'all want to hear more? - Yeah, but can she tie her own shoelaces? - Sounds like she don't have the time. - Sounds like she wears boots. Come in. - Captain Swaggert? - Yeah. - I'm investigator Macleah. - You boys get out of here, I got some work to do. Nice to meet you Miss Macleah. - Nice to meet you. - May I help you with your bags? - Oh no, that's okay, I got it. I know I'm running a little behind schedule. I was going to rent a car, but they didn't have the model that I wanted so I took a cab instead. Which actually probably saved me a lot of time since the traffic out there only seems to be getting worsened. Cab drivers usually know of shortcuts, but I think this guy took the long way. It was okay. I'll pick up a car later when we're done here. - Do you want some coffee or something? - Do you have any tea? - Tea? - Yes, earl gray, Twinings, english breakfast? - Have a seat will you? - Oh, thank you. - Darlene could you fix a cup of tea and bring it to my office please? - Did you say tea Captain? - Yes I did, don't you have any? - I think we have Lipton's. - How's Lipton's? - Oh that's fine. - That's fine Darlene, thank you. So how long have you worked for the state division? - A little over four years. - And how do you like it? - I like it very much. Is it alright if I smoke? - Be my guest. - Would you care for one? - No thanks, I quit. - I'm working on it. - Here you go. - Thank you. - And I understand that your specialty is profiling? - Yes sir. Actually we have to call it suspect analysis these days because of the big flack with psychiatrists a year or so back. I guess they thought we were encroaching on their turf. Interesting how a single word can be that threatening to an entire occupation. - And you use computers quite a lot? - Yes sir, we take a victimology matrix and superimpose it over a hypothetical framework. A suspect behavior constructed on a computer database and then we look for intersecting modes to reinforce the model. If you would like I could have the Austin office fax you my resume. - They already did. So you were a year with the FBI in Quantico. - Yes, profiling, victimology classes, that sort of thing. - And three years on the road? - Mm-hm. - What was that like? - Slow, but it was the only way to get to where I am now so. - Bachelors in political science, med school, masters in psychology. - I guess when I was younger I thought I was gonna save the world. Another Albert Schweitzer or something like that. - What made you change your mind? - I didn't like the pain that I saw everywhere. Actually I suppose that's what got me into this, but I didn't want that kind of responsibility. - What kind of responsibility is that? - Healing. - Tell me did your office brief you on this case? - No sir, they told me that you would do that. - Why don't we take a walk down the hall? - Now we have several specimens. Four right, three left, one likely pair. According to the numbers in the palms we have a broken series from two to 13. - What is the age range of the victims? - Well we haven't run any tests yet, but judging from the size they're young. - Very young. - Looks that way. Subcutaneous, fascia, veins, arteries, musculature, all severed cleanly with a very sharp blade. This is not some gorilla with a meat clever. - This is Sergeant Footman. - Morning. - Sergeant Belvin. - Howdy. - There's Lieutenant Creedmore. Jimmy's my right hand man. There's Vince from forensics, y'all have already met. This is Sergeant Delarand. The sergeant is our resident computer guru. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You may sit over there Miss Macleah. Alberto, would you kindly pull those shades for me? - I'll get these here. - Thank you Footman. Also turn off the lights if you would. Now then I know I don't have to say this, but just for the record I don't want you talking with your family or friends about this case or with anyone outside the department staff assigned to the case. As you well know there's a whole lot of anxiety in the community, people are scared as hell. So just keep your mouth shut. - Each victim was Caucasian. There are no blemishes and no malformations and no birth marks. Now the numbers have been tattooed on with imperishable ink. And we found traces of formalin in each of the specimens. Now that would explain why they're so well preserved. Now these tiny punctures you see here and here all the way around. Those are suture marks and each specimen has them which would suggest they've all been severed and reattached. - What about age Vince? - Well there does seem to be a relationship between the numbers on the palms and the probable age of the victim. - So the lower the number the younger the victim? - That's right. I'm guessing we're looking at about five years of age for the smallest specimen and about 10 to 12 for the largest. - Excuse me. - Miss Macleah? - Yes, I have a question. I was just wondering about what efforts were made to identify the victims? - Well we fingerprinted each one of the specimens of course, but if the hands all come from children it's not likely we're gonna get a match doing an optical bank. - We requested birth certificates for local missing children, but there's no fast way to match out the hand prints. It'll probably take weeks to get through what comes in. - Well what about DNA fingerprinting? - Well what would be the point? We don't have any samples to match to. - Well what about the parents of missing children? - We've already pulLed the national MP list into our database. That's over 2,000 names. - And each one of those would have to be cross indexed one at a time. The only rapid search we could run is our local list. - So why not take samples from that? - We don't know yet if the victims are only local. - And we'd have the families of every missing persons case from the last 10 years down here on our backs. - Not if you reduce the list of candidates to those matching the specimens for age and gender. - Miss Macleah you are talking about contacting parents who are wondering if their children are still alive and asking them to come down here for a blood test. They're gonna want to know why? What do we tell them? - We tell them that we have remains which need to be identified. - They already know about the hands. - See it really doesn't matter what we tell them after we make that call because they're gonna be so frightened that it is their child they're not gonna be able to think of anything else and if you multiply that fear by several hundred we would have a situation here that we could hardly control. - Well it seems to me that you don't have a crime scene and you don't have any identifiable remains unless you make some assumptions. Now in order to go forward and profile a suspect you need a victimology. I mean without that as a base you really don't have anything do you? - Yes, well now that the rain has let up I expect we're gonna find the rest of the victims' remains in the sewers in the next few days and that is our top priority right now. - Yes, but if all the victims' remains were thrown into the sewer pipe at the same time they can be scattered all over the city by now and why would the hands be placed in bag? Maybe because the hands were dumped separately from the bodies. Maybe the bodies were dumped somewhere else. I mean what if those remains are miles away in another sewer pipe? - We won't know that unless we look for them will we? - Would you close that door please? Y'all come on a little stormy in there didn't you? - I was just speaking my mind sir. - Well I guess this being your first day and all you're just a little too wound up huh? - Not anymore than usual, no. - Alright then. In the future if you have something to say about a directive I would appreciate if you would just say it and drop it. Don't turn it into a contest, alright? - Yes sir. - Good deal. We got this call this morning from a doctor who wants to talk to someone in person about this case. Now I want to send you out on this because frankly I don't have anything else for you to do around here. You got a problem with that? - No sir. - Alright. Do you know where the state psychiatric hospital is? - Can you tell me where Dr. Singer's office is? Thank you. - Dr. Willis, line two. Dr. Willis, line two please. Dr. Singer? - Yes. - I'm investigator Macleah. I'm working with the Houston police. - I'm a little surprised. I didn't expect someone so quickly. - You did ask to speak to the police? - Yes, but I've been hesitant about this because of case confidentiality. Because there's no way to fully explain the situation on the phone. I need an answer to a question. - Go ahead. - The hands that you found. - Mm-hm? - The police said that there were numbers on the palms? - That's correct. - Are these numbers in a series from one to 18? We have a young boy in seclusion who's been here since he was four or five years old. He was passed from the adoption agency to the state foster program and well then to us. He has seizure states which are very violent. And one of the traits is bleeding from the wrist all way around like an incision. At first we thought they were self induced, but we searched his cell and we've never been able to find anything that could create such a wound. Watch your step please. For some years now along with the seizures he's been drawing hands on the wall of his cell in pairs. And each new pair of hands that he draws has a different pair of numbers. Good morning Danny. Would you let us in please? - How many patients are down here? - Just one. Thank you. Right this way. This used to be our isolation ward. When we built a new wing we moved most of the patients out. - Why is he still down here? - This is his home. This way. Good morning Jordan. You have a special visitor this morning. She came just to meet you. Danny. This is Miss Macleah. - Nice to meet you Jordan. I would like to take a few photos if I might? - Sure. - Thank you. - Danny why don't you take Jordan to get a clean set of greens. - Okay. - Where are the hands drawn? - Here. Did all of them appear at once? - He's drawn them a pair at a time over the last 10 years. We repainted the cell once but he just scratched them back in again. - They were drawn in sequential order? - Yeah. Each pair was drawn on the same date each year, July 16th, his birthday. - Has he ever been released? - Not since he was admitted. - And when was that? - About 10 years ago. - Has he ever spoken to you about these drawings? - He hasn't spoken since he's been here. He was diagnosed as an elective mute when he was five or six years old. - Good morning Jordan. Jordan I'd like to talk to you about the drawings on the wall. I'd like to find out more about them. I brought some crayons and some paper and I thought that maybe if I had a question you could write down your answers for me? How does that sound? - He don't like anybody to touch his doll ma'am. - Could you leave the room for a moment? Let's stop pretending for a moment okay? We both know that you're not stupid. Now I don't know if you drew these hands or not, but if you did you must have a reason and I would like to know what that reason is. I see. She does all the talking, huh? Goodbye Jordan. - All clear here, no sighting so far. - Go back to that other half. Little more. Good. Easy now, very easy. - Excuse me, Captain Swaggert. - Good. - Morning Miss Macleah. - Morning. - I think we might have something. - How deep is the water there? - Good money says about 10 feet. Park it right there for a minute. - May I speak with you for a moment? - Sure thing. Alright boys we're coming in to see what you found. - Alright, bring it up. That's it, that's it, easy now. - I've been looking over the medical files for Jordan Thomas, the boy I told you about from the hospital. Now his birthday is July 16th, this is the same date every year that he has these seizures. It's also the same date he draws the hands. - So what's that got to do with this case? - Well seven disappearances over the last nine years fall on July 16th. Now if you put them into a series starting 1984 you get a victim set which matches the specimens for age and gender. Seven names could be the victims. Now what I would like to do is spend more time with the boy. I think he may be able to help us. - Well look if you got a list of names to go on why don't you focus on that 'cause I need a profile as fast as you can build one. - Yeah I know that sir, but the names are only speculative. There's no positive ID. There's no certainty unless you're able to find something down here. - Hey are you alright? - Yeah, I'm a little dizzy that's all. I think I need to get some air. - Alright, I better walk you back. - No, just give me some room. I'll be fine. - Let me help you. - Don't touch me please. I'm fine. I'm alright. I have a little trouble in closed spaces that's all. I'm okay. - I understand. Just take it easy now. - I'm fine. - Captain? - What is it Jimmy? - It's a false alarm. They pulled up a mannequin. - Say again? - They netted a goddamn mannequin. - 10 four. - I'd like to go in by myself. - Yes ma'am. - Good morning Jordan. That's a very pretty song, did somebody teach you that? I thought that maybe we could start again. Cute. Are you enjoying yourself? Alright you can stop it now, it's not funny. Listen to me, this is not a game. Look, I need your help. I need you tell me why you keep drawing these hands. I don't want to play anymore games, do you understand me? Do you understand me? Ouch! We're fine. If you ever do that again I'll bite you back. So you can write, huh? Again. Again. Well if this is all you have to say to me then I guess we have nothing to talk about do we? You want to keep it, is that what you want? If you want to keep it write it down. Write it down. Good. It's a start. - This is Deanne Alberti, age five, at the time of her disappearance July 16, 1984 from Twin Pines Park. This is Susan Lewins, age seven at the time of her disappearance, July 16, 1986 from Peace Park. This is Janie Monahan, age nine at the time of her disappearance, July 16, 1989 from Lakeview Park. Mary Klugman, age 10 at the time of her disappearance, July 16, 1990 from Eastwood Park. All four of these children were identified by DNA paternity tests. Bill. - Captain. Now, all four IDed victims were found in different parks. All four of these parks are in upscale parts of town where the patrol watch is above normal. All four victims were abducted in broad daylight, in front of family members or friends, or both. - It means our man is one slippery mother. - Yeah. - Excuse me, I have a question. - Miss Macleah. - We are obviously dealing with someone who is very intelligent and very methodical. He must've received some formal medical training so he's highly educated as well. He's also willing to take great risks, but he reduces the risk by choosing his location in advance along with his victims. I mean he can't arbitrarily be choosing different parks for each of his abductions and his victims fit a very strong pattern so he has to seek them out individually so that nothing is left to chance. Now the date of significance to the killer is July 16th. It's part of his behavioral pattern, but the last abduction that fits this pattern was Mary Klugman, which was three years ago. - Uh-huh. And what is your question Miss Macleah? - Well it would seem that he has either become inactive or he's changed his pattern which could mean a whole new set of locations and dates and maybe even a new type of victim. I mean he could be evolving in ways we know nothing about. - Maybe he just got spooked, you know? And he just went looking in a different neighborhood for his kids. I mean if he is as smart as you say he is then he knew that he was pushing his luck with seven kids in seven years. - You found the hands eight days ago. Today is the 12th. For him to dump those hands so close to the 16th. I mean that cannot be a coincidence. I mean it's gotta be some kind of a signal. - Maybe he's about to return to his old hunting ground. - Maybe we should just take his hunting ground away. - I know that this is very difficult for you Mrs. Klugman, but I need to ask you about that day, about what you can remember. - Do you have any children Miss? - No. - It's like your whole world just stops. Just comes to an end. - How many times do we have to tell this story to people? I mean what is it, you come into our house, you ask us the same questions and you write down the same answers. You just throw that away? - I'm sorry that this is so hard for you. - Oh you're sorry? I want to know why that thing's still out there just taking kids off the street. Why haven't you found him, huh? Can you tell me that? Just answer me that question. - It's alright Martin. If it'll help then I want to do it. - Thank you. - She was just playing with a group of friends, neighbor kids. - Do you remember if there were any adults nearby close to your daughter? - The park was really crowded that day. No. No, she was just with her friends. Three other kids, I knew them all. And there were two other mothers on a bench close to me. I was taking care of my neighbor's two little boys and one of them needed to go to the bathroom so I took both of them. - How far away was your daughter from the bathroom? - Maybe, I don't know, about 100 feet. I'm not sure, maybe a little bit more. - So did you go inside the bathroom once you got there? - Yes. I helped both the boys. They were both very young. But I could see them from the bathroom. - And how long were you inside the bathroom? - Not very long. 10 minutes. Maybe a little bit longer. - Do you remember any sounds from the park? - Just the sound of children playing and there might've been a radio playing or something like that. I don't even know how I heard it. And then I walked out with the boys and all the kids were there, but Mary. Nobody even seemed to notice she was gone. And the kids were all playing like nothing had happened. They were just laughing. - Yeah. - And the bear says you don't just come here for the hunting do you? I told you. It's your joke. - Excuse me. Does anybody know what this is all about? I found it in the reserve's drawer. - Let me see that Jimmy. Oh yeah, this. Yeah I looked at this till my eyes crossed. - Well what's on it? - Well, a neighbor kid was in the park earlier that day shooting home movies. - The same park she was abducted from? - Yes. Hey, it's two hours of kids' feet, back of people's heads. Made me dizzy just watching it. - Did anybody do a frame by frame analysis on it? - That was three years ago. - Like I said, I looked at it. So did a half dozen other people. And now, hey, it's all yours. - Thanks. - Yes ma'am. - Delarand. - Hi, it's Audrey Macleah. - Hello Miss Macleah. What can I do for you? - I need you to do a name search for anyone holding city permits to sell concessions to the parks. - Okay, no problem. I'll do it for you first thing in the morning. - No, I need this done right now. Run whatever you find through a unit for all prior arrests. I need as much of a profile as I can get. - Look, this could take a while. I need to access a half a dozen data banks - Fine. Fax it to my terminal when you're done. - Yes ma'am. - Looks good. That's very good. Try... Stand up on this chair. Come on. Now, put this in your hand. Hold it up to the light, higher. Higher. What do you see? - Howard Speckett this is the Houston police. We have a warrant to search the premises. Open the door. - Let's move. - Move, go, go. - Go. - Captain. - Bedroom's clear back here sir. - Bathroom's clear. - I found them in the bathroom. - Search the premises for anything sharper than a butter knife. - JD, you have a telephone call. - He says Speckett didn't check back in last night. He's been driving a substitute van until his regular van is fixed. - Where's it being fixed? - It hasn't bene. It's right down there at the end. - Alright, have Belvin and Foot to check it out, will you? - Howard Speckett. Shit. - Over here boys! You alright? - Yeah, I couldn't see him. It's too dark in here. - Brady, move your units around the complex. Looks like our boy slipped through us here. - Freeze! Freeze dammit! - Ow, ow. - Stay right there. Show us your hands. We got him. - Jesus. - Spread 'em. - Jordan can you hear me? Good. Now I want you take a big deep breath. Good. Now we're gonna play a game Jordan. Would you like that? Okay. I'm gonna ask you some questions and I want you to write your answers down on the paper okay? Okay. Now we'll start with a very easy question. I want you to tell me your name. Jennifer Lynn. Well that's a very pretty name. Did Jordan go away? - Hello? Hello? Is anyone in there? - Then where are you now? Under the ground. Is anyone else in your room with you? Sometimes. Who else is in your room with your sometimes? Daddy. Is Daddy in your room with you now? - Hello? - Jordan I see hands all together. Are these hands in your room? Are there hands in your room? Daddy gives them to you? Why does Daddy give you the hands? So you can play. Can you draw a picture of Daddy for me? And how does Daddy give you the hands? He makes them? How does Daddy make the hands? It's alright Jordan. No, no, no. Hey! Jordan. It's alright, come on. No, Jordan, Jordan, look, I'm gonna count to three and when I count to three you're gonna be calm and safe. One, two, three. It's alright, it's alright. It's alright. Go to sleep. I'll come back tomorrow, okay? Jordan I'll come back tomorrow, I promise. I promise I'll come back tomorrow Jordan. - Help me. Help me. - I know what it's like to be alone. To be pushed away. Locked into the darkness with all that pain and fear. It's like a terrible secret. I won't let anyone hurt you anymore Jordan, okay? Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Hello? - Miss Macleah, it's Delarand. - What time is it? - Time for me to get out of here. I got some data for you. - Alright, go ahead. - With first and last name I have three Jennifer Lynns listed within the metro area. As last and first I have none. As first and middle I have one, but according to public record she's deceased. - What's the date of death? - July 16th, 1979. - You want to spell the last name for me? - Jennifer Lynn Eben, E-B-E-N. - And where did she die? - Lakewood Hospital. But they've been closed for over 10 years. - I haven't been down here, but once or twice since they closed it down and then it was only to pull out a couple of old beds. Now be careful there's all this crap around. - Yes? - I'm Investigator Macleah. I'm working with the Huston police. Is Dr. Eben at home? - No I'm sorry, but he's away on vacation. - Do you know when he'll return? - Not for another five or six days. I hope there isn't any trouble. - Oh no, not at all. You are? - I'm Mrs. Voss, the housekeeper. - Mrs. Voss would you mind if I came in for a moment? I would like to ask you a few questions. - Well, yes, I suppose. - Great, thank you. - Could I get your something to drink? - Just some water please. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Here we are. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Are these pictures of Mrs. Eben? - Yes. She's lovely isn't she? She passed on some years back. Oh here's my lady. I never knew the woman, but I hear that she was a great musician, a concert pianist. - Do you know where Dr. Eben's gone on vacation? - Oh no, he keeps his plans to himself. Well, he checks in every now and then, but he always likes to be left alone. - So he doesn't tell you where he goes? - No. I'm sorry. - Oh. Does he take his daughter with him on his trips? - You mean Jenny? I don't know. Of course he visits her quite often I suppose. - Visits her? - She's away at a private school in Europe. A very fine school for girls. - You know I didn't notice any pictures of Jenny. I wonder if you have a photo that I might be able to look at? - Why yes of course. Let's see. Of course I didn't know her myself, but she's a lovely girl. Oh here we are. This is a fine picture. Isn't she a pretty girl. She looks just like her mother. - And where was this taken? - I don't really know. - The date on this is 1962. - Oh. Well it is isn't it? Well then this must be a picture of Mrs. Eben and the house she grew up in as a girl. - Yes, could I speak to Captain Swaggert please? This is Audrey Macleah. Well could you get him on dispatch for me? Oh my god. It's okay, it's okay. I tell you it's okay. It's okay, no, no, no, no. I'm here to help you. Shh, shh, I need you to be calm alright? No, shh, I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm gonna help you okay? I'm gonna take this off your eyes. I need you stay calm, alright? It's okay, look at me, look at me. I'm a police officer, I'm gonna help you, okay? I'm gonna take this off your mouth and I want you to be very very quiet and nod you'll be very quiet okay? Okay, okay. It's okay. I'll get your hands. Okay. And then we're just going to walk out of here okay? Walk right out of here, alright? Shh, don't be scared. No, no, it's okay. Don't, shh. Shh, shh. I want you to be quiet. Shh, it's okay, it's okay, okay? Be very very quiet. I'm here with you. I want you to stay right here. Just stay right okay? Don't say anything. Okay? Jenny? It's okay. I'm gonna help you. Don't move. Shit. Oh, shit. It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna help you now. We're gonna go outside okay? We're gonna go together. Ouch. Shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh. Shh, you have to be quiet. You have to be quiet. I know you want to go home. I'm gonna get you home, but I need you to be quiet okay? Nod your head you'll be quiet. Alright stay here. Shh. Shh. - And how's my little girl today? Your Daddy brought you a special surprise. Happy birthday my pet. Now it's time for you to play a song for your daddy. And who would you be? I asked you a question. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Look at you. You're shaking like a leaf. Let me see your hand. Let me see it. Let me see it. - Fuck you. - That's not what I had in mind. - Put your arms around my neck. Good girl, good girl, good girl. Here we go, here we go. Right here. Stand there. Okay. Okay, okay. Oh shit. Now, there we go. - Jenny. Oh shit. - Jenny.
