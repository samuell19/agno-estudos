[Aravind] I've been waiting for this... day, you know? [Julie] I know. [Aravind] You're just out of the world. [Julie chuckles] [Julie] Can you hear me? [Aravind] Um, yeah, I can hear you. [Julie] Do you like what you see? [Aravind] Very much. [Julie] So, will that change after you see my face? [Aravind] No, definitely not. [Julie] So, let's remove our masks. [Aravind] Um... Okay. You go first. Show me your beautiful face. [Julie] How do you know I'm beautiful? [Aravind] You have beautiful fingers. [Julie] Really? Let's remove our masks together. Come on. [whistle blows] [sighs] [Julie humming] [Aravind] Julie? [Julie] Yeah? [Aravind] Just listen to me. [Julie] What? [Aravind] Imagine if this was not a web chat. [Julie] Okay. [Aravind] And I'm standing right in front of you. [Julie] Crazy. [knock on door] Aravind, I can't take this anymore. [in foreign language] Why did you marry me? Don't irritate me while I am working. U.S. clients! [in foreign language] I have to work in the night. [in English] Just go to sleep, you know, I will be late. [laptop chimes] [cell phone ringing] [whistle blows] [kids chattering and laughing outside] Hi, Aravind. How are you? Fine. -Congratulations for your promotion. -Oh, thanks. When is the party? Mm. Yeah. I'm planning and will call you soon. -Tell me in advance. -Yeah, sure, sure, sure. [cell phone ringing] I have to take this call. It's from my Shreya Baby. [man] Yeah, okay. [Aravind] How are you, Shreya Baby? [in foreign language] Nothing. What's your plan for today? [in English] How is your captain grandpa? The military man. [chuckles] [in foreign language] Good, good, good. Mom has gone out. Yes. [in English] When she's back I will ask her to call. Okay? [in foreign language] Okay, fine. How is school? Uh-huh. Ah. Ah. Yeah, yeah, we miss you, too. We miss you, too. Next year. Sure. Oh. Surely. Yes. [in English] Okay. Promise. [in foreign language] Give Daddy a kiss. Mm. [kisses] [cooing] [in English] Give me a second. [line ringing] [in foreign language] Where are you? Come back soon. [Swathy in foreign language] I have some shopping to do. Will talk to you later. Are you angry with me even now? Sorry. Work is like that. What can I do? Hmm? [Swathy in English] I have no charge. I will call you. [line clicks] [laptop chimes] [in English] Sure. [Skype startup sound plays] [Skype dialing sound plays] ["Moonlight Sonata" playing on video] [Aravind] Hey, where are you? Can you see me? Can you hear me? Um, nice music, by the way. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I will take off my mask, okay? No, no, no. I will like your face. I promise. [gasps] Now... keep your promise. But you are not Nikki. [in foreign language] What are you? The real Salman? No, right? What? I don't follow much Tamil. In English? [in English] You are not Salman, either. Yeah. I think it's a mistake. Let us chat some other time. Why? Do you chat only with girls? Hmm? Um, no, it's not like that. But, uh... You promised. Please talk to me for some time. It won't take long. Um... Okay. Tell me. What do you want? Thanks. Come on. What's wrong with you? I don't have time. Have you seen anyone die? Die before your eyes? No. Why do you ask? Have you not even seen a... road accident? You should be kidding me. No, I have not seen a road accident. Then it's your lucky day. Lucky? What do you mean? Once in a lifetime opportunity, my friend. Get ready for a unique experience. [pigeons cooing] Do you like, uh... uh, reality shows? I don't quite follow you. Hmm. In a few minutes... I'm going to kill myself. What? Yes, my friend. [in foreign language] In this reality show... [in English] I am going to kill myself. You can watch it live. You are going to commit suicide and you want me to watch it... live? Yes. This is sick. I don't want to be part of this. Please. [in foreign language] You don't need to do anything. [in English] You just sit and relax. It's the last wish of a dying man. Please. See, look... I don't know what your problem is. You know, only cowards commit suicide. All right? If you want, you can talk to me. Know we can figure it out. Together. -I'll help you, man. -Yes. Only you can help me now. Just... watch me die. That's all I am asking you. Please. [woman clears throat] [sighs] [in foreign language] Hello. Are you going to spend the whole day painting this rose? [in foreign language] I was... But a black mole changed everything. -All the time thinking of just one thing. -Mm. -Is that my fault alone? -[chuckles] Hey, do you know him? [laughs] [cell phone ringing] Why does he want to die in front of you? [in foreign language] Raj, I don't know who he is. If he dies, will I be in trouble, man? How many times have I told you not to do things like this? We do not know who is on the other side. [in English] Okay, man. What should I do? You take that cursed mask and burn it. -Raj... -I will call you later -Is there any problem? -No. [laptop chiming] [pigeons cooing] [rattling] [pigeons fly away] [voicemail in English] ...is either switched off or not reachable at-- [cell phone chimes] [inaudible] [Skype ringtone playing] Hello? Where are you? You bastard. [in foreign language] I knew you would come. You are a coward. That's all? [in English] Your swearing does not bother me. Continue. What do you want? [in foreign language] I want you to watch me die. [in English] That's all. You could have done that earlier. Now... you don't have a choice. See... what you do behind closed doors, is open to all nowadays. Devils are orbiting our Earth. They see everything. Please... Please delete that video. [in foreign language] What would I do with that video? [in English] But if you break your promise again, the world will see it. I don't want to trust you. Trust? [chuckles] [Aravind on recording] Imagine if this was not a web chat. [Julie on recording] Okay. [Aravind] And I'm standing right in front of you. Do you have a choice? I need to switch on the fan. [man] And your switch is with me. It's an irony that what men like the most in private, they want to hide it publicly. But why me? Lot of people do this in chat rooms, right? [in foreign language] Because... [in English] the most greedy fish bites the bait first. But why? What did I do to you? Why should I watch you commit suicide? And from where the hell did you get my video? [in foreign language] You ask too many questions. -But I need to know. -Mm. [in English] The need to know fuels the journey of life. [in foreign language] Life is like a question paper... [in English] Full of questions. Today you will ask one question. You will find an answer tomorrow. Then one new question will arise. [in foreign language] That is... life. [in English] But... the answer sheet is in your hands. [in foreign language] You know what's good about this? [in English] You can correct it. What are you talking about? See, I don't need your classes in philosophy, okay? You may need them. Philosophy helps you heal. But you still have not answered my question. You are not ready for the answers yet. [in foreign language] We have just started. [in English] You will have to wait till the end for the answers. See, I don't have enough time. My wife may be here anytime soon. Hey... you are a smart guy. You know how to handle this. What to tell her. [Aravind on recording] Don't irritate me while I am working. U.S. clients! You are free to disconnect anytime. [in foreign language] If you have the courage, [in English] disconnect right now. And let the world see who you are. See, look, you don't have to be repeating this again and again, okay? You wanted to die, right? Just go ahead and fucking die. [man laughing] Shit. You are wasting my time. You are mad. [man] Just a few minutes back you were lecturing me against suicide. Now you can't wait to see me die. Goodness in man is always a variable. [in foreign language] It's very difficult to be a good man all the time. [in English] It takes lots of effort to remain good. I don't want to be good to a criminal. Tell me your price. Blackmailers like you don't have the guts to commit suicide. It was you who said only cowards commit suicide. A man who is not afraid of death is priceless. You cannot buy him. Let me show you something. Where are you going? Hello? Wait, my friend. [Aravind] I cannot see anything. [man] You will know my worth when I'm gone. [Aravind] What? Shit. Hello? Shit. [Skype dialing sound plays] [Skype disconnection sound plays] [buzzing] [laptop chimes] [cell phone ringing] [inaudible dialogue] [inaudible dialogue] [cell phone rings] [buzzes] [in foreign language] Bastard, pick up the phone. [pigeons cooing] [rattling] [in English] Shut up! [Skype ringtone playing] Please delete the video. I am sorry. YouTube settings are private. No one else can see it. [in foreign language] Did you get scared? Thanks. [in English] Aravind, look here. This will be my deathbed. All these candles will be lit. And that knife will cut my wrist. This entire tub is going to turn red. [in foreign language] What, Aravind? It will be very nice, right? But how do you know my name? [laughing] [in English] The devils. They know everything about everyone in this world. I don't understand. They told me your secrets. What do you mean? Your anti-virus software is out. I let the devil in. You bugged my system... The devil is tamed. He is my friend. He has not caused you any harm yet. You have harmed me. Not only me, but also the girl who trusted me and had a relationship. It was our private moments. You didn't have any rights to record it whatsoever. Let me show you... something. Something... very interesting. I own your privacy. So, the girl, Julie... You know her? I don't let strangers in. Who is she to you? I'm really sorry. But tell me, please. Is she your sister? Your girlfriend? Tell me, please. Is Julie your wife? [in foreign language] What does it matter who she was? [in English] Does not matter anymore. Does it? I really apologize from the bottom of my heart. Please forgive me. I have never met her outside the chat room. I promise. It was just a virtual relationship. Um, it was not real. Then... Why are you letting yourself be blackmailed by something that is not real, hmm? See, whatever happened has happened. I am damn sure it won't happen again. Please let me go. Listen... wounds have memories. They rewind the past and keep playing it in the present. [in foreign language] Only time has the stop button. [in English] It heals. Yeah. Time would definitely heal. I beg you, please don't do this. Please, let me go. Go. [in foreign language] I am not stopping you. e[in English] But if you stay, we can travel back in time... and see if it really heals. [doorbell rings] The bell is ringing. Got to open the door. Everyone should open their own doors. -No one can do it for them. -[doorbell rings] You may find... a friend, enemy, or maybe your wife. [man chuckles] [doorbell ringing] [in foreign language] One minute. Don't keep me bored, okay? [in English] Come back soon. Okay. [doorbell ringing] ["Moonlight Sonata" playing] [doorbell continues ringing] [in foreign language] Why did you take so long to open the door? Hey, is everything okay? [woman] Hi, Aravind. We just want to go to a good movie with family. Can you suggest a nice movie for me? Your choices are good. ["Moonlight Sonata" playing over laptop] [music stops] [in foreign language] Who was it? A friend. Um, a neighbor. I sent him away. [man laughs] Neighbor. But not a friend. [in English] Life in apartments nowadays. Hmm. Okay. Get ready to travel back in time. Shall we? [sheets rustling] Julie? Julie. Oh, my God. Julie. Shh. Don't wake her up. Sleeping woman is really attractive, no? What do you say? What did you do to her? Nothing. [in foreign language] I just made her sleep. [in English] Now... you and I are going to do something... together. What are we going to do together? I'm scared. [in foreign language] Huh? Scared? [in English] You came looking for excitement. I don't want to disappoint you. No. I don't want to do anything. [in foreign language] Why? [in English] Let's travel back in time... and relive that night. You were chatting with Julie. Let's do it again, huh? You are sick in your head. I can't do that. You don't have to do it. I don't enjoy seeing naked men. Don't torture me like this. At least remove her mask first. Sure. But only in the end. That's how you play the game, right? [in foreign language] You also can wear your mask if you want to. [in English] Come on, my dear friend. Don't waste time. Eh? [Aravind] First, wake her up. No, no, no. [in foreign language] You know why? [in English] It is very difficult to undress a woman when she's awake. Mm? You do whatever you want. I am not going to be part of this. [man chuckles] You are definitely a part of this. I will undress this sleeping beauty. You will instruct me, mm? That is impossible. [laughing] Nothing is impossible. This moment has already happened. We are just replaying it. Time travel. You just sit and watch. [Aravind on recording] I have been waiting for this. Take off your top. [Julie on recording] Yes. Wait, wait. [Aravind] Don't be shy. Take it off. [Julie] Wait. Hang on. [Aravind] Okay. -[Julie] You should be patient. -Don't. -[Aravind on recording] Yes. -Don't do this. [Aravind on recording] Let us, you know, do it. Please. [Aravind on recording] Maybe, you know, just one button. Please. -[Julie] Yes. -[Aravind] Shit. -[Julie] So, can I...? -[Aravind on recording] Yeah. -[Julie] Can I? -Please. -[Aravind on recording] Yes. -I beg you. [Julie] Yes, I am. -Shut up! -[Julie] I am. Can you see? Just watch quietly. [Aravind on recording] I've never seen anything like this before. Oh... [Julie] Are you...? Are you crazy? [Aravind on recording] You are crazy, not me. [Aravind] Oh, God. Don't do this. [Julie] I know you are liking it. [Aravind] Please listen to me. Just once. -[Julie] Really? -[Aravind on recording] Now-- Now let me go to the next... stage. If you want to call it that way. Okay, here we go. -[Julie] My God. -Please. [man] Shh. [Julie] Stop it. [Aravind on recording] Now, go on. It's your turn, yeah. [Julie] I know, I know. Can you...? [Aravind on recording] I'm going to close my eyes. Please show me your legs first. Then... [Julie] Why do you want to see that? [Aravind on recording] Oh, my God. Can I fall at those feet? Show me more. [Julie] Oh, no. Let's stop it. No. Please. [Aravind on recording] Come on. Julie, what happened? Don't be shy. [Julie] No, no. We have to stop. [Aravind on recording] Let's lose all inhibitions, baby. The cherry, come on. -[Julie] No. -[Aravind on recording] Please. -[Julie] No. -[Aravind on recording] Come on. -[Julie] Okay, okay. -[Aravind on recording] That's my girl. [Julie] I know you like it. -Can you hear me? -[in foreign language] What happened? [Aravind on video] Yeah, I can hear you. Lost in your imagination, right? [Aravind on video] Very much. Just stop this nonsense, okay? I can't take this anymore. [Julie] Let's remove our masks. [Aravind on recording] Okay. You go first. Show me your beautiful face. [Julie] How do you know I'm beautiful? [Aravind on recording] You have beautiful fingers. [Julie] Really? Let's remove our masks together. [in foreign language] Come on. I thought you like all this. [in English] I thought you enjoyed it. No? See, I was just following your instructions. This is rape. You are doing this against her wish. That, too, in front of another man. -You are not being yourself. -What do you mean? [in foreign language] This is not right. You are advising. [in English] You are preaching morals. Is somebody watching us? No. Why? You are what you are when no one is watching. This is what I am. I won't do this to a woman. I won't violate her privacy. See, what you are doing is... really wrong. [laughing] [in foreign language] What I am doing? Yes. Whatever happened between me and Julie was by mutual consent. I didn't force her. Like what you are now. You are talking too much. [in English] Definitely you are hiding something. I don't have anything to hide. -Is it? -Yeah. [in foreign language] Let us see. [in English] Time will reveal everything. There is no escape. Hello. Oh, shit. What happened? What happened to her? Hello. [in foreign language] She's sleeping. [in English] Deep sleep. No. You are lying. You killed her, right? Oh, my God, you stripped a dead girl? [in foreign language] You got scared? I'm going to go to the police. I'm calling the police. Police come, and? [in English] I've decided to die. No future. So, no fear. [in foreign language] Call. But, what if you are caught alive? Hmm. [in English] That won't be nice for your future. Okay, here you go. Hi. Let us both remove our masks together. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I will kill you, bastard. You coward, I will kill you, man. I will kill you! The honor is mine. -[in foreign language] Fuck you. -[in foreign language] Aravind, look... What can we do? He killed in front of me. Aravind. This is not the time to get tense. -Get lost. -Aravind. -Kill him! -We have his photo. -Kill that swine. -We will go to the police. -[in English] Let's go to the police. -[in English] Let's go. Hey, Raj, I have his number. He sent it to me on WhatsApp. [ringing] -Raj, that idiot. -Pick up the phone. He is calling. [man on phone] Don't leave me alone. Connect back. I am going to the police. [man] Then what about your wife's video? Eh? In which you are instructing me to strip her? That will be the mother of all MMS scandals. People would love it. You can't do that, man. [man] Then reconnect on Skype. We have a lot to do before I die. Shit. That bastard. [in foreign language] You sit down. You sit down. You connect to Skype now. See, I have people in the police. I will handle it. You connect, connect. I sent the number. Have you got it? [man over phone in foreign language] Yes. It came. Okay. Where should I come now? Please show me your face. Where are you? You are just on time. She is moving. She is alive. She is moving. -God. -You killed her in your imagination. In reality, she was alive. Where are you going? What are you going to do to her? Whatever you say. Please let her go. Mm. Do you think she's dressed for that? -Swathy. -[Swathy] Mm. Swathy. Look who is here. Stop it. Stop it. Please. -[man] Swa-- -Stop it. Okay. Please put her clothes on. [in foreign language] Sure. [in English] But... what if she wakes up? [Swathy moaning] What is that? -[in foreign language] To make her sleep. -What is that? To make her sleep. [in English] Does she take sleeping pills? Yeah, sometimes. But why do you ask? [in foreign language] These days there are so many duplicate medicines in the market. [in English] It was supposed to work for at least 3 hours. Please put on her clothes soon. As far as dress is concerned, I have always followed your instructions. Dressing up a woman is always more difficult than stripping her. Hello, hello, why are you covering the camera? I want to see what you are doing. Do you want to watch me dressing up your wife? This is his photo. Ambeth, Aravind's message has come. Swathy is still alive. Can we do something unofficially? No, no. It's not possible. We put in a request to trace the phone call. -How can it be made unofficial now? -Okay. You managed to take only this one snap? You made me believe that this is Julie. You cheated me. You thought she was someone else's wife? But you told me it was your wife. You imagined it. I never said anything like that. You never imagine bad things happening to you, right? But you put Julie's dress on Swathy. [chuckles] I just played a small trick. Why don't you just go and fucking die? Now! [laughing] Of course I will. [in foreign language] Before that, I want to ask you. [in English] You recognized her face, not her body? [in foreign language] Are you not ashamed? [in English] You could have stopped me anytime. But you took so long to recognize your wife. Swathy never wears a Western outfit. So, I, uh... You are guilty. That's why you are getting defensive. If people get to sleep more, the world will be a better place. Let us not wake her up. I don't trust the drug anymore. Aravind, what are you thinking? You have planned it all very well. Hmm? Yes. It took almost one year for me. Then, who is Julie to you? She can be whatever I want her to be. What do you mean? I gave her all my savings, for her services. I wanted an English-speaking girl. [in foreign language] You understand only English, right? She's a call girl? I can't believe it. -[in English] Hey. Call them divine beings. They tame the beast in men. Do you miss her? Huh? She does not look like a call girl. They look human, too. She's a very good actor. You thought she fell for your charms? Tell me, who planned this? Whose plan is this? [in foreign language] His mobile records are here. -Sir. -See if there's a number you recognize. Sir, Swathy's number is in this. [in English] Is it? [in foreign language] Last night he called her. This morning she called him thrice, sir. -It looks like they are together. -[in English] Let me see. [in foreign language] No, sir. As far as I know, Swathy is not a girl like that. -Ambeth. -Sir. We cannot take any chances. [in foreign language] I will have to answer the commissioner. -Do a thorough background check first. -Sure, sir. Sir, how soon can we track his location? His name is Yohan. An address in Munnar has been given here. Inform the local police stations. Give top priority and follow this. Don't beat around the bush. Give me a straight answer. Ask me the right questions. Okay. Why is she on your bed? And did you guys plan this together? [laughing] So, you think we are having an affair? I don't know. But I think you both are... together. Do you want that to be true? Maybe that feels better for you. I called her just before connecting with you. [in foreign language] Right. [in English] I messed up her shopping plans. So, she was with you. -While talking to me over the phone. -Yes. She was here. She came on her own. It was her choice. What fucking choice? Just like you made your own choices, she made hers. We are all free to make our own choices, and the consequences that follow, as it's free will, too. No, that's not possible. Swathy cannot do that to me. You are not answering my questions properly. Swathy knows the answers. You can ask her when she's home. It takes talent to ask the right questions to the right people. At least now tell me, who you are, what you want, and why are you doing this to me? I'm done with this, man. I'm done with this. Extreme emotions put you in touch with your own humanity. [in foreign language] You'll begin understanding me from now on. [in English] Now I will tell you why I wanted to kill myself in front of you. I need to drink some water. [in foreign language] Okay, go. Yeah, come in. Good morning, sir. [in foreign language] Sir, I have collected details about Yohan. He has given an address for a house in Theni. I made inquiries and found that he is an orphan, and left for Munnar five years ago for a job. -What job? -Hardware engineer, sir. [cell phone rings] -Aravind's calling. -Get it. -Hello? -[Aravind] Raj, what's happening there? We are trying to track him. I will give it to the SI. One minute. -Hello, Aravind, -Sir. Ambeth speaking, SI. Do one thing. Sir, please, in English, sir. Listen to me. Just go on talking to him. Because we have to catch him alive. Okay? Sir, he is really mad. Swathy is in danger. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -I am really afraid. -I understand. -Do something fast. I'm cutting the call. -[in foreign language] He cut the call. -Raj. -You have Yohan's picture in your phone? -Yes, sir. You send this picture to all police stations in Munnar. Any information on this should be directly conveyed to me. Okay, sir. Raj, do one thing. Send his picture to me on WhatsApp immediately. Sir. We have been talking to each other for a while now. Just try a little harder. You might remember me. No. I don't remember seeing you. It's not your fault. I used to look much better. On that day I looked my best. -[man 1] I'm leaving. -[man 2] Have you done everything? [man 1] I will come two days from now to check. [man 2] Angel? [chuckles] I am feeling sleepy. [motorcycle engine starts, then accelerates] You don't worry. I will take care of her, sir. Call me Dad, not sir. So far, I haven't had a chance to call anyone that. [in English] Let the lights be on. [in foreign language] Is this just for tonight, or...? [in English] What attracted you to me? [in foreign language] Oh, that? I will tell you. I like your long hair a lot. But you cut that off. Oh. [laughs] [birds singing] [inaudible dialogue] Angel? [in foreign language] What happened, Angel? [inaudible dialogue] [man in foreign language] Go and search the Net, sir. There's a video titled "2 Lips." The whole world is watching you two. Why are you shouting at me? Sir, please give back my mobile. Can you please wait outside for a while? I need to speak to him alone. Seat him outside. Without switching off the light, cameras had been set up in the bedroom and shot clearly. It could have been your plan. Tell me the truth. Sir, why should I do it, sir? I did not say you uploaded it to the Net. You could have done it for fun. A lot of this happens these days. If that was the case, why would I come here? Don't get emotional. Even if it was God, we would be suspicious. Deva, call him. Do you have the name, address, and phone number of all those who attended the party? I have everything. I'll bring it in the morning. We... Angel is alone in the house. Okay. What did you say your name was? Yohan. Do you suspect anyone? No, sir. Mm. Did your daughter have any affairs before her marriage? Nothing like that, sir. Okay. Let me know if you think of anything. Okay. Why is it covered by paper? Angel? Angel? Angel. Angel. No, it's not like that. [phones chiming] [horn honking] [whispering] Sir, the details of the website that has the video are listed there. The date and time of uploading is also there. I have marked the user IDs in red. Please do something soon, sir. This information is very useful. [in English] We will try our best. [in foreign language] Hey, Deva, how many times should I remind you that I need sugar in my tea? Call that boy. -We will try. You can leave. -Sir. If you can give this list to Cybercell, they can block those websites. At least do that, sir. What, sir? Are you teaching me my job? In this station, it's not just your case. There are many. We know what to do. You may leave. [in English] Sorry, sir. I am unable to show my face to the outside world. [electric razor buzzing] [in English] I like this look. Now, no one can recognize me. Do you recognize me now? Yeah. The 2 Lips video? So, now you know who I am. Sorry. One of my friends showed it to me. Is it? Yeah. [screams] [Angel moaning] [Yohan] Angel. What happened, dear? What have you been doing so far, sir? When will you delete that video? When we arrest the accused, we can delete what he uploaded. Then what happens to the remaining websites? [in English] Look, Mr. Yohan, you are a hardware engineer. [in foreign language] You know it is impossible, don't you? Sir. If the same had happened to a policeman's wife or daughter, would you keep quiet? [Arumugham over phone] His anger was justified. But I didn't know what to tell him. Social media is very powerful. Even if this had happened to the U.S. president, [in English] there's absolutely no way we can take anything off the Net. -It is so scary to even think of it, sir. -Raj, has Aravind ever gone to Munnar? I don't know. -Mr. Arumugham... -[Arumugham] Sir? ...have you arrested anyone in this case? [Arumugham] Yes, we have, sir. [men shouting] [yells] [Arumugham over phone] If allowed, Yohan would have killed the plumber with his bare hands. For the plumber, it was a routine to fix cameras in every home he went to. We found a lot of videos on his hard disk at his house. -What about 2 Lips? -We could not find that video. He claimed he lost the pen drive somewhere. -Mr. Arumugham. -[Arumugham] Sir. Then, Yohan? [Angel grunting] [Angel crying] Angel. [Yohan] Angel? [muted audio] [water running on video] I wanted you to be the first person to watch her video. [Yohan screams] [crying] [Arumugham] After that he became a madman. He would roam around on his own. He would not talk to anyone. He apparently attempted suicide once. But he was saved. When did you last see him in Munnar, sir? [Arumugham] I don't remember, sir. I have not thought about him since then. That plumber? That plumber got out easily on bail, in three months. Hm. But for what he did, he died like a dog after he was knocked down in a road accident. Sir, then why would he target Aravind? [Yohan] God had other plans for me. [panting] [Yohan] Tell me. I had the pen drive, sir. I lost it, sir. Please trust me, sir. I did not upload it on to the Internet, sir. -All this... -Sir. ...is because of these eyes only. Sir. Sir. What are you going to do, sir? Don't, sir. Leave me, sir. [grunting] Sir! Sir! Don't, sir! [man screaming] [thudding] [vehicle approaches] [thudding] [Aravind retching] Enough vomiting. Come back and sit here. [rings] -[Raj] Sir, Aravind is calling. -[Ambeth] Put it on speakerphone. [Raj] Aravind, you're on speakerphone. Talk. [Aravind in English] Raj, he has killed someone. He is very dangerous. -[in foreign language] I am very scared. -Dangerous? What do you mean? [in English] Sir, he has killed someone. He showed me the video. He has tortured. [in English] Killed someone? Okay, do you know whom he killed? -A plumber. -Plumber? [in foreign language] Aravind. Hello, Aravind? Disconnected, sir. [cell phone rings] Hello. Yes, tell me. He is in Anna Nagar? One second. -Ambeth. -Sir. [in English] Yohan should be close to Aravind's flat. [in foreign language] Get there immediately. Yes, sir. Hello? In which station limit is the telecom tower? Did you share the video with your friends? No. How many times have you watched it? I don't know. Actually... maybe a couple of times. What are you looking at? What is it? You have seen it 168 times in the last one year. [in foreign language] The last time you watched was three days back at 10:14 p.m. Okay. You are smart. You bugged my system. So, what's the big deal? [in English] Are you justifying it? No, I mean, it's not a big crime. There are many things on the Internet people watch every day-- Shut up! In the filthy dark corners of your brains... people like you... keep raping her rotten corpse day and night. When alive... she never spoke. But now... I keep hearing her screams from the grave. See, what happened with you is really unfortunate. I didn't know that she could not speak. I did not know about her death either. I won't watch it again. Hey, I promise I won't watch it again. Yohan! Hey. -What are you going to do? -Angel is waiting for me up there. I'm going to die a slow death. Just like her. If I'm interrupted... -then I will kill Swathy. -No. Please. Please don't harm her. Then, I will make it simple and upload her video. I don't want blood on my hands. She is innocent, man. [Yohan in foreign language] Angel also was innocent. [in English] Did you think before uploading her video? Huh? What? I think you're mistaken. I did not upload. [in foreign language] I see. -No, trust me. -[in English] Tell me, how did you get that video? Please. Please, move the gun away. I'm afraid, man. Let me explain. [Yohan] Okay. Then, tell me everything. See, you have mistaken me for someone else. I did not upload the video. You have successfully deceived people with your face. I know what you really are. I swear. Believe me, please. I did not. [cell phone chimes] Just do what I say. Open SXSVIDEOS on your browser. Yeah, it's a porn website. Go to "Profile" and search for Owl69. -Owl? -[Yohan] Owl69. Do you see 2 Lips listed here? Yeah. So, what's the point? Owl69 is your ID. You have uploaded all these videos that are listed here. Come on. Say it! Yeah, it's me. [sighs] [in foreign language] "Masked Beauty." It's Julie's video, right? [in English] You were preaching to me about morality. [in foreign language] "Black mole." You are good with titles. Okay, who is this lady? See... the videos that I have shot, and is-- Which is here... it does not show their face, okay? It... does not do any harm. But 2 Lips, I understand. -It's a plumber. You know it. -No, it's not him. You uploaded it. And you named it. What? It is there on many websites. Why do you think it's me? This is ridiculous. I found the original video in your bloody laptop. Its "created date" is just five days after my marriage. I have hacked many systems. The video in yours is the earliest. I've lost patience. Let's finish it. No! No! No! Stop, stop. Stop it. -Tell me. -Stop it. Okay. I got the pen drive from a parking lot. In Munnar. I was on work. I was on work. Take the gun-- Take the gun off, man. So? You uploaded it just like that, right? I'm sorry. All right? I never imagined... That... someone would ever find you out. You could have been a little thoughtful. You knew very well that the video was captured using hidden cameras. [in foreign language] If you had thought a little bit... [in English] I would have been a father by now. Your lust killed my child... my Angel... and her father. [crying] I'm really sorry. It's the plumber who placed the cameras in your bedroom, right? If not for him... I would not have uploaded the video. He died a very painful death. You are lucky. Your eyeballs are in their place. I've planned... something else for you. What? Something... less violent... but more painful. I didn't think it would kill someone. I will delete it now. I will delete my entire profile. I never... Don't move from your chair. I have some work to do. [siren wailing] Whatever happened between us has been recorded. I made a small video out of it. It's called 2 Lips Ends. It begins with... suicide of Angel... then, torture of the plumber, followed by... the edited version of our conversations. It ends with your confession. Aravind, you are going to be famous. Please don't do that, man. It will end my career. I won't be able to show my face to anyone. I will die. Please forgive me. What I did is wrong. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please, please. Please, I beg you. The foundation of justice is revenge. Not forgiveness. But Swathy... she is innocent. Why do you punish her for my mistakes? What you did to Angel, I did to Swathy. It hurts, right? Now you know what it feels like being a victim. Please, please, please, don't do it. -Please. -Killing you would've been easier for me. But I have decided against it. Now, people will know your true nature. Please don't do it, man. People like you watching this video will think twice before shooting and uploading the videos of their victims. Thanks for watching this video 2 Lips Ends so far. In a while, I'm going to kill myself. And... Mr. Aravind is the lucky one who is going to watch it live. Please don't forget to share it. Bye. [siren wailing] Before you die, I want to tell you something. Both you and the plumber are guilty of the same crime. Angel will not forgive you for what you did to Swathy. [cell phone rings] [Julie over phone] Do you want to know... why your husband doesn't sleep with you? What are you saying? Why should you bother? [Julie] Hey, hey, relax. I stay in your apartment, 13/6. If you come tomorrow morning, I will show you something. But who are you? I'm Julie. I've no charge. I will call you. [Julie] See this. [Aravind on recording] Julie. [Julie on recording] Yeah. [Aravind] Just listen to me. [Julie on recording] What? [Aravind] Imagine if this was not a web chat. [Julie on recording] Okay. That, too, in front of another man. Time will reveal everything. Where have you gone? Hello? Aravind... I need to look into your eyes... till I fall unconscious. Keep looking at me. Look at me, Aravind. I promise... I will kill Swathy. Don't spoil this. [in foreign language] Look here. Look. [knife slashes] [siren wailing] [speaking indistinctly] Aravind, look at me. [banging on door] [banging on door continues] I told you not to disturb me. [in foreign language] Will you not even let me die in peace?! [Aravind] No... I did not do anything. No, don't. No. No. No. Don't! [gunshot] Swathy.
