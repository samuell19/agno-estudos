All other colleges have two whole months, dog. We got one day, my nigga. - Hey damn, Flyy. I just put in one year rap. All right, man.

Michael ain't called you in what, two months and he wouldn't even tell you which hotel he was staying at. - He probably didn't know yet, Raynesha. - Excuses excuses, girl. - For your information, I called his mother and she told where he was staying at. - OK, miss freshman, OK. - Man you know in about a couple hours, man, the beach gonna be full of honeys. Just lovely honeys. - Yeah you right about that, my nigga. Bitches gonna be everywhere, you know what I'm saying, black bitches, red bitches, brown bitches, know what I'm saying?

I remember everything was Southboy this, Southboy that. Y'all was together since your freshman year and now it's towards it the end of your junior year and it's over just like that? - Just like that. I don't want to talk about it. OK? - All right. - Look, I will tell you this. You need to be careful with Michael 'cause ain't nothing out here in Daytona but some booty shaking freaky girls this weekend. - Ray, Michael loves me and nothing's gonna change that. - Look look you my cousin, I love you, but you're a freshman, you're just in puppy love. - Ray, that's killer, all right, me and Michael are cool. - OK, see see, I'm through with it. But let's go get our grub on but do me a favor. Please let them pay for it, do you hear me? - Why you telling me this? - 'Cause you pay for everything on the way down here. Gas, food, all of that. - Well Kenny charged the rental car on his credit card so I thought we could at least pay for a few things. - See, all I'm saying is this. Let Southboy kick out a little bit. If he decides to leave school and go pro he'll be making a bank load of money in a couple of months. Make 'em pay, that's all I'm saying. - Make 'em pay, then. - And Flyy, you tripping man.

All rules change for him. She don't understand. All rules change. - I hope this guy doesn't sweep you off your feet like you're some damn Prince Charming because it's business, Southboy, business. - Ray, Ray, Ray, chill.

God. - Hey, look, tell me, tell me Southboy. You engaged? Got a girlfriend, you know? Anything of that nature? - Remember that girl you met today, Raynesha? - What's the real deal, you're still not telling me nothing. - Look, see, I don't know, I don't know. Look. I guess I started to feel ignored. It seemed like every girl on campus knew where my man was but me. I was starting to get pissed off. I thought I was the laughing stock of the campus. So I tried to get Southboy's attention. I did what you did today. - What was that? - I lied. I told Southboy I had sex with Terry Miller. - Raynesha. - Look. I was lonely, I tried to get his attention. - Like that? - Look, I gave him this excuse about it being an accident, but he didn't buy it. Now he thinks I'm some slut or something. But nothing happened between me and Terry, nothing. - You sure you ain't sleep with Terry Miller, girl? - Look, hold up, Raynesha Hawkins may talk a lot of mess, but that's one thing I would never do to my baby is cheat on him. Because I love him too much. - She cheated on me with the star basketball player. (laughing) We just friends now. - Yeah, well, Southboy, look. I think I got a little something something that's gonna take your mind off of all of that. - Yeah? - Mm hmm. Oh, Sherry.

(laughing) Yeah, well, look, send him a limo for Spankx' party tonight, uh huh. Hey, hey, hey, look, look. I tell you what. I need you to go ahead and set up a press conference tomorrow around noon, OK? And make sure that all the press is there at the hotel. Oh yeah, oh yeah, he's gonna sign, he's gonna sign. I guarantee it. - Yes, I'm OK. No, my room was not on fire, I said I put a fire out in my hotel. No, I'm not a fireman now. No, God damn it, no, I am a sports agent, I am not a fireman. Yes, I know I got to go to school for that. What are you, nuts? No I did not race in there to save my boyfriend. Honey, I don't have a boyfriend, Jesus Christ. All right, Billy the Crook, no more Mr. Nice Guy. To the party I go.

Next time I'm in town, maybe I'll do your video. - Damn. - Boy, I tell you, man. - I heard Southboy's fucking with Crooklin. That shit's a mistake. - Look at this, Southboy. Now, I know Flyy. Flyy is your main man. I know that. But once you become part of the Crooklin family, you see, well, then you're gonna have to get you some new main men. You know what I mean? - You mean like get some new friends? - Mm, mm, no, no, no. (laughing) No, absolutely not. See, no, you know, see, you gonna be a pro ball player, see? With lots of resources. So you need to hang around folks who are just like yourself. - I can't believe that guy gave Southboy all that jewelry. - I can't believe he's actually taking a drink. - As long as I've known him, I've never known him to take a drink, smoke a joint, or anything like that. Southboy is tripping. - Look, look, look, Raynesha and Charity there. No, no, no, they can't compare to Sherry. Sherry. Sherry is the type of woman that you need on your arm. Not them two tramps you drove down here with. You see what I'm saying? - Yeah, I see what you're saying. To be honest with you, Mr. Crooklin, I'm tired of all of 'em. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, see, that's only natural, Southboy. You see, money, money hangs with money, you see? (laughing) Yeah, you see. You never heard of no pro ball player driving they Benz in the hood talking about picking up an old school buddy, you see? No, you see that. That just don't happen. - I see where you're coming from. - Yeah. - You know what? I think that Crooklin guy's a bad influence on Southboy. - For an ex-girlfriend, you sure sound concerned. - See. I do miss him a lot, OK? This has been part of my life. - So what you gonna do about it? - Do about it? I'm gonna get my man back tonight. Come on. - If you ask me, I think you need to dump that whole crew I seen you with this morning, you see, including that Kenny Flyy. - Word to your mother, man, tell him we'll do it, man, if your friend make him understand you, man. Crooklin gonna rob his ass, dog. - Yeah, if you see that fucker Crooklin, tell him he better give me my money, or else he's gonna be waking up with a horse head in his bed, I'm serious. - Hey, man, I don't know, Crooklin got this nigga nose wide ass, you know what I'm saying? - Telling you, man, got to make him understand. It's important, dog. - Nigga hard headed, dog, you know what I'm saying? - Hey, man, hard head make a soft ass, man. Can't tell you, you know what I'm saying? Can't stress it. - Gonna go solo, man, I'm gonna go hard at him, you know what I'm saying? - Do what you got to do, boy. - Southboy. You more than that, hmm? You about to be a pro ball player. (laughing) - I feel ya, I feel ya. - Yeah, yeah. - I said a night club. No, I'm not dancing for money, honey. I'm looking for Southboy. What are you nuts? No, I didn't say little boys, I said Southboy, that's the player's name. (hip hop music) - Oh, shit, there goes Southboy right there. Oh, yeah, it's on, it's on. - Girl, Southboy standing over there all by himself. It's time to go make your move, OK? - I know that. Damn agent going over there talking to him. - Girl, every bitch in this place want that boy. If you don't go over there now, you'll never be able to have Mr. Southboy. - You know what, I'm gonna get his ass high, look. - Nigga, you gonna get his ass, and take him to the room, and fuck the shit out of his ass, for you and for me, OK? - You know what?

The police called him, I guess that's a good thing, but all my boy thought about was playing football, that was the most important thing in his life. Now it may all be taken away. Doc, Doc, how is Dayrun, Dayrun Southboy? - Oh, oh, yeah. They're just finishing up with him. He'll be out any moment. - See, he's gonna be OK. - Yeah, we got to stop shooting each other over the BS. That cat was just jealous of Dayrun. Just jealous. - And Raynesha was just about to go tell him how much she loved him. - Hey, here's your all American. - Are you OK? - Yeah. - How you feeling, playboy? - Everything's cool. - Yeah? - Everything's cool. - He was lucky, the bullet passed clean through. That's what we call a flesh wound. I'm gonna keep him tonight, but tomorrow I'll give him some crutches and let him go. - Thanks, Doc. - Thank you, Doctor. - Good looking out, Doc. - Doc, can I have a few minutes with my friends? - Oh, sure. We're gonna do some rounds. I'll come back for you, OK? - All right. (chattering) So where's Ray? - She couldn't take it, so she's at the hotel packing. So I came instead. - So where's Crooklin? - Man, I hate to say I told you so, man, but the cat was a crook. - While you were passed out, he came and took all the jewelry he gave you and ran out the door with that damn tramp. - Said something about you being a wounded horse, wasn't no good to him no more, you know? - Wait. So how did I get to the hospital? - Man, Vinnie brought you to the hospital. And jumped on the guy with the gun and held him down 'til security came. - Damn. - Vinnie did all that for you and that Crooklin didn't even come to the hospital to see if you was dead or alive. - Damn. Wait a minute, so where's Vinnie? - He's at the police station, man, filing a report. So what you gonna do, man? - Man, when I was in there talking to the doctor, made my decision. God gave me talent, I'm gonna use it. - That's right. - No more fucking around, I'm turning pro. - That's good. - How about this, big dog? - I need that, man. I need that. Thanks, Flyy. - Any time, big dog, any time. So. What's up with you and Michael? - I ain't thinking about Michael no more, man. I'm tired of running behind that boy. - Good, 'cause you don't have to run no more anyway. You got a new nigga. - Why you looking at me like that? - How about being Flyy lady? - You gonna be OK? - Oh, I'm gonna be straight. Why don't y'all go and discuss details? (hip hop music) - Dayrun, are you all right? - Yeah. I'm cool, Ray, I'm cool. Just a flesh wound. Went right through me. Nothing's wrong, I can play the football. Got to say this, though. - OK. What happened to, where's Flyy and C? - Got a little thing going on. - What? - Yeah. Look, look, Ray, forget about that. I want to apologize to you. - Dayrun. Let me apologize to you, OK? I haven't been very supportive, whatsoever. I realize you have a lot of pressures on you for being a football star. I just thought you were looking for some cheerleader or something so I started acting childish. - Ray. I don't know if I ever could forgive you for having sex with Terry Miller. I mean. I can't not ever forget that. - Honey, that's just it. I never slept with Miller. I haven't been with any other man since you laid eyes on me our freshman year. I lied to make you jealous. And just think, I may have never had had a chance to tell you. Never. - Damn. I mean. You went to that extreme, I must have really been tripping. - Oh, yes, so, Mr. Southboy, your butt was definitely tripping. - This shit has got me spinning, man. Money. Pro football. It's scary. - Yeah. - You know, I was thinking. I don't think I want a girl that might just want me for my cash. And of course I need an accountant. So you know what I'm saying? - So, what are you saying? - I'm saying, how would you like to be my wife? How does Raynesha Southboy sound? - Yes, yes, Southboy. - I love you. No more lying to each other. - No more lying to each other. - No more lying to each other. - No more lying to each other. - I have you all here today to announce that I'll be foregoing my final year of eligibility at Watson Howell University to enter into the NFL draft. I made this decision after a careful self analysis of my skills and accomplishments, and I feel that I can be an immediate impact for any teen that would welcome me. Last night, I also realized the true meaning of friendship and trust. Once again, Dayrun Southboy, from Watson Howell University, will be turning pro. If you have any questions, you can speak with my agent, Vinnie Carusso. - My boyfriend did not shoot him, OK? I'm not cheating on my boyfriend, all right? Because I don't have a boyfriend. But I did get the job, OK? Not a blowjob, the job. OK, yeah, Dayrun signed with me last night. I'm a real fucking sports agent. No more fucking used cars, OK? - Come here. See, you about to get on my last nerve with that damn bullhorn. - What you mean? - What I mean is you pissing me off. Nipping around here like you the principal of some rowdy behind high school or something. - Yeah? I'm just trying to-- - What you trying to do is make me act like a nigga on this here job. Just like I done on the one before this one and the one before that one. - Now, look here. I don't tell you how to check folks in in here. So don't you come tell me how to keep 'em safe. - Southboy, don't worry about a thing. I'm gonna be the best damn agent you ever heard of. - Hey, cool, Vinnie. Hey, I appreciate that. You know, don't forget to get to get Flyy a recording contract, it's real important. - I got that shit covered, man. - All right, cool, cool. Look, I'm gonna haul ass to school, all right? As soon as I get there, I'll call ya, we'll get ready for the draft. - Rocking. - Later, V. - Later, D. - Now, so far as I'm concerned, you little flashlight cop, you ain't nothing but a certified 911 dialer. - Security guard is very, very important. - Important? Y'all ain't even got no TV show. Everybody got a TV show. They got Cops. They got FBI Stories. Everybody got a TV show but I ain't never seen no TV show about no security guard, huh? I ain't never seen no camera crew following you around asking you what it was like to be a security guard, huh? Man, get up on out of my face before I about to tell you about that tight ass suit they got you wearing. Looking like a 1975 Greyhound bus driver. - Sup, home boys? (chattering) Check this out, here, check this out. Y'all see this? See this? (chattering) Let's ride, baby, let's ride. You know what I'm saying? - Woo, this has been a hell of a weekend, huh? - Got that right. Got my heart broken and fell in love, all in the same weekend. - Damn right. - Let's ride, dog, let's ride. You know what I'm saying? Ride, baby. (hip hop music) - Hey, you ain't leaving me here, no. Hey, I'm gonna get you, Flyy. Hey, man. Man, Raynesha, hey, wait. That's fucked up.
