We were never really just friends. I mean friends-friends. Alex, are you still up? Just doing a bit of work, and then heading out. How's work? You don't update me. Okay. Wow, great update. I got a new brief for a project I really want. I get to make my own show. Seriously? Congrats. It's not a big deal. Hey, it's your own show. That's actually a big deal. I have a new crush. Cute? Looks like he's gonna love me. So, not cute? I never dated anyone ugly. Jess, maybe this time think before hooking up. I think with my heart. You think with a different body part. I'm leaving. Why? Didn't I say 8pm? Jess, it's 9:00. You're late. Fine, I'm the bad friend. I didn't say that. I'm going to miss you. Whose fault is that? Alex, why are you being cold? Jess, it's fine. Just go back to work. The scene's taking so long. I just want to go home. I'm so haggard. I'm the number one fan of who you are at 3am. Only at 3am? Hi guys, I'm Alex. I'm a writer, director, photographer, production designer, and social media manager. Today I'm gonna pitch a show called Manila Bae. It's about Andie. She's a gay girl trying to find love in Manila. So Andie's lesbian? Yeah. I wanted to represent all Filipino millennials. So you cast a tomboy as lead? Are there sex scenes? Well. It's based on real life. So we can tackle relevant issues like coming out. Coming out. Is that still a thing? Apparently. Yeah. I don't even think we can do a kissing scene. Maybe just imply it. Two faces moving closer and then whoosh. Yeah. I don't think we can make a lesbian show and not have any kissing. It kind of sends the wrong message. Then just change the character. Make it a guy, name him Andy! Yeah. That's a good compromise, I think. I like that. Okay look, we like you. We like your work. We like your concept, but I think it needs a little more work. Can you present again by next week? So I should make the character straight? Did we not just discuss that? Okay, I'll just work on it. Then I'll present. See you. Faster, more smoke over there. The ladder. Take the ladder out. I keep repeating myself. Miss Jess. I'm good with my lines. [ Matinee idol, Mark Ramirez, namedrops Jess Torres in bar fight ] Are we ready? Is that okay? This is for Jess. Let's shoot this. - Let's just shoot this. We're good. Kevin. Can I have your phone? We'll put a sack over your head. Where's the sack? Go ahead. Hey, please be careful. Hands inside or outside the sack? Inside. Boys, get out of the frame. We're shooting this. Come on! Call it. In three, two, one... Get that movement right. Practice it. Okay, get down. Three, two, one. Action. Where are you taking me? Get this off me. No work talk, it's my birthday. Let's go. Okay, guys. Wait. Happy birthday, Julo! Happy birthday to me. I wish that this year, your crush finally comes out. Who's that? Anyway, let's do shots. But just one round, cause I have work early tomorrow. Oh, come on. Everything we do, everywhere we go, even when we party- it's kinda like work anyway. So... Shots! Cheers! Happy birthday. Whatever! Okay, I feel like I'm getting too old for this. What's your name? You first. This is a little too strong for me. Too strong? Is he really doing this to me? It's my birthday. Let him be. Anyway, I'm here for you. Alex! Alex. Wake up. Alex. Alex, I need you. We just broke up. I know. How'd you find out? Cause you're here. I called you last night. Fuck. Oh my god. I'm late for work. - Alex. I'm late for work. That's okay. I'm always late for my shoots. Where were you last night? Julo's birthday. Julo? Your boyfriend? Yuck. Gross. Why is it gross? He's cute. I saw in Instagram. Julo, David and Kate. You've been with them a lot lately. Okay, I just missed my shoot. That's better because I've missed you. I miss you. Don't you miss me? Okay, so this is guy number what? Guy number? Maybe we just won't talk about it. I wish we were as good at being together as we are at breaking up. Practice makes perfect. So your mom's name is Practice? I didn't know that. Alex, you think you're cute? Thinking otherwise can be fatal! Only you think that, Alex. So is this really our last? Save the best for last. Last 'til next week? Last 'til you're ready to come out to your Mom. Just go to Girl Bar next Wednesday. Julo misses you. And he's mad that you weren't at his party. Alex, have you? Ever stopped to think about why you refuse to break up with me? I never stopped thinking about you. So... Wednesday? Wednesday, okay. Whatever. Let's go. Do you need help? Good on my own. Bye. Bye. Alex, what time were you home last night? Got home in the morning, Mom. I was with Kate. So you're back together? Don't know. It's weird. When am I gonna meet her? I don't know. We're not together. What am I gonna tell my friends? My daughter's a lesbian but she doesn't have a girlfriend. Alex, get your life together! Are you good with your lines, Miss Jess? I'm good. Thank you. Girl! Mother! Good news. You're the Bay-Bae! Is this the poster? Look! Starfish are meant to fly. Mother, we've been waiting for this. Look at your darling. Fabulous! What do you say? Thank you Mother! It's a great project. You're the new prime time princess! Can I post it online? Of course! So I'll leave that with you. Miss Jess, excuse me. We need you on the set. Okay, I'll follow. Thank you. What's this? An interview? Yup. For your new show. For my show? Alex, how many jobs do you actually have? Well. For today, just this. Are you ready? Which do you prefer? Career or love questions? Career. What's your biggest insecurity? Insecurities? See, when you're new in showbiz, they teach you to thank everyone all the time. Thank you very much to all my supporters. But what if you find out that no one's actually supporting you? What if they find out you're actually insecure? That you really can't act, that you're always late. Am I just going to be a starlet forever? What next? Just make me look smart okay! Okay fine, let's move on to love. What does love do to you? Sometimes I think. I've never really been in love. How about your exes? You've never been single. Well. They tell me they're in love with me. But me? I don't know. Who knows. Isn't this cute? Stick to acting! You're so mean. Such an artist! Okay. I told you it's just casual. What are you wearing? It's figure-hugging and also sparkly! This is casual. I'm in sneakers. Okay. So David's the stylist. Julo's the photographer. David's the photographer. Julo is the stylist. Oh yeah. I've worked with Julo before. I hit him with a monobloc chair. So Julo's been in love with David for the longest time. But David might be straight. That's so weird. Falling for your best friend. Yeah. So weird. How about Kate? How'd you become friends? In fairness, she's hot. Is she single? I think she's single. Let's set her up. One of my exes, Raymond. He's single now. I don't think she's into guys. I get it. She likes them mature. Real men, daddy material. No, I mean she's a lesbian. She doesn't look like a dyke. What's she supposed to look like? Don't know, like a dude? Just remember David's the photographer, Julo's the stylist. You get that wrong, you'll never set foot here again. Ever! Okay? Okay. Ready? Last retouch? Fine. But be quick with the makeup. Let's go? Yeah. Oh my god, look at that girl in the yellow dress. Tragic! Her dress looks nice. No, it's not. Did you come from work? No. Is this your Instagram? Oh, I follow you. I don't follow you for obvious reasons. Your feed's ugly. Can't you use a filter? Look she uses frames! I don't use filters, so it's my natural skin color. Your natural skin color? - You? I use Snapseed and VSCO cam, but obviously you haven't heard of those. Is this your magazine cover? Yeah it's from last month. Last month. Your outfit isn't helping you. Like what you're wearing now, actually. You should get a stylist. Like for everyday, not just for shoots. Is it your first time here? Yeah. That was obvious, too. Right? My god, that took long enough. What a bitch. You know it. Wanna go in? No, I just wanted to drop by and tell you that I'm moving by the end of the month. End of the month? That's so soon. Alex, I've been looking for you. Jess. This is my friend, Kate. Kate! We finally meet. Hello. Yeah right. She was literally just dropping by. Okay. Let's grab something to eat. Kate's calling. It's okay, I'll call her later. I can't believe you come to my apartment trying to win me back. And then introduce me to your basic bitch of a best friend as your friend. You're full of shit, Alex. Alex is driving. But I'll tell her that her ex-girlfriend thinks I'm a basic bitch. Why didn't you tell me? I'm your best friend. What's the deal? You're really a dyke? I prefer lesbian. Since when? Since forever. Even when we're together you like girls? Yup. Fuck you, Alex! What else are you keeping from me? First my boyfriend's an asshole, then my best friend's gay. There must be something wrong with me. I need to do yoga. You need to do yoga because I'm gay? Jess, I didn't tell you because I thought you would react like this. Alex. Focus. Focus. This isn't about you. How did this even happen? It's like this. Just because everyone here gets the deep-fried pork doesn't mean I have to order it too. I want my smoked beef. That's just what I want. Does your Mom know? Yeah. And she's okay with it. Your Mom knows and I don't? You don't even see each other. I don't want this deep-fried pork anymore. I lost my appetite. You want smoked beef? Can I sleep over? Hug me. I can't. Why, cause you're a dyke? Lesbian. And I'm tired. Promise me, nothing's gonna change between us. That I can still call you at 2am. And that I can still sleep beside you. Promise me. Promise. Good night, coconut sherbet. Good night, sweet bread. Good night, rice cake. Good night, cassava cake. Good night, soy pudding. Good night. Alex, was Kate here last night? No, Mom. It was just Jess. So who's your girlfriend, Jess or Kate? Mom, I'm working. Isn't Jess single? You would be good together. Give it a shot. Gosh. Wait. Did you say that Jess is going to mermaid school? Oh my god. That is so my dream. It's your dream to be a sea monster? Like you're not secretly in love with me. Secret? Who said it's a secret? Okay, speaking of secrets. Jess finally knows. I'm free. Well, finally. Now that Jess knows, you and Kate can get back together. Cause I super miss her. Alex has a new girl. It's hard to be in love with your best friend, huh? You should know. Okay, wait. Are you dating Jess? She is so basic, you can't date her. And I don't want to hang out with her, we shouldn't hang out with her. She wore a sparkly dress. Okay, you can relax. Jess is straight. Isn't that your type? Supposedly. Isn't that what you are? Supposedly. Okay, let's just get on with the shoot. Fine, back to work. - Fine. Is this hair fixed yet? Chin up. Mark and I were talking on FaceTime. He said we should have break up sex. I asked him if he knew golden rule number one. You can't have sex with your ex. But he said, technically, we won't break it if it's on FaceTime. So there. What did you do today? Work stuff. Is that allowed? No. They won't approve. Alex, how do you date a girl? How do you date a boy? So it's like best friends who make out? Yeah, best friends who make out. Okay. Plans tonight? Dinner? Movie? Or both? I can't tonight. Why? I have dinner with Kate. Dinner with Kate. I thought you broke up. Don't forget golden rule number one. You can't have sex with your ex. She's leaving by the end of the month, so we're just catching up. Tomorrow, promise. I have to be honest with you. I'm going on a date tomorrow. I just thought you should know. Cool, good for you. Alex, this is what people do when they break up. They eat dinner? They move on. Are we still broken up if I told you that I already told Jess? About us. Jess? I mean? I thought the reason we were hiding was because your Mom didn't know. The reason why we were hiding was because I hadn't told my best friend yet. Why couldn't you tell Jess? Because- I hid for a year because you couldn't tell your best friend. Do you know how fucking weird that is? My Mom wants to meet you. Actually she's been nagging me about it. I can't meet your Mom. But you've always wanted to meet my Mom. Why don't you just tell Jess that you like her? One of the scariest things about coming out is finding out if the ones you love are still around after. She's the one I couldn't risk losing. There's your answer. Hi. Hi. Hey. Hi. Been waiting long? Yeah you? Why is she starting to dress like you? Shots! But just one round since I have work tomorrow. Let's do shots! Tequila? Let's have Jaeger instead. Jaeger? What are you, in college? You know, Alex always makes out with guys when she's drunk. It's like how straight girls make out with other straight girls when they're drunk. We know you're basic, but you're not stupid. Alex has been in love with you for- Guys, shots! Hey. You know, I was just telling Jess how- Ouch. Shit! Why are you laughing? She slapped me. Hold on. Seriously? It's okay. Come on, let's get another drink. Alex, don't follow me. Hold on, where are you going? Don't leave. I'm tired. I just wanna sleep. I hate this outfit, it's so ugly. And I'm tired of your friends who try so hard to look cool. Do they think they're cool just because they wear oversized shirts and they don't smile in photos? And now you're laughing at me? You're taking their side? They were laughing at me. And you're taking their side? Hold on, Jess. I told you to stop following me. Fine. Fuck! My driver just cancelled on me! Can I hitch a ride home? I'm still mad at you. We need a costume for Wednesday. Good evening. Just take a look around. It looks good on you miss. Cute. You're not in the mood? You haven't paid for that. I'm not used to this. With girl parts? What if I make a mistake? What if I don't know what I'm doing. Do you want me to sing for you? So you don't get scared. Fine, sing for me. You were meant to say, no thanks. I think my singing is scarier than your impending gayness. Sorry. It's an offer you can't take back. ♪ Let me know if I'm doing this right ♪ ♪ Let me know if my grip's too tight ♪ ♪ Let me know if I can stay all of my life ♪ ♪ Let me know if dreams can come true ♪ ♪ Let me know if this one's yours too ♪ ♪ Cause I see- ♪ Hi. Are you okay? You, are you okay? I'll get back to you in five minutes. I'm enjoying this secret life. Are you happy? For the first time, I have something that's just mine. For the first time, I have something worth sharing. No. I don't want to share. You're mine. I'm yours. So should I tell my Mom? About? Us. She asked me the other day if you were my girlfriend. What did you say? Nothing. Just changed the topic. If my Mom found out, she'll go crazy. They'll freak out. They'll cut me off, telenovela-style. They'll go- Jessica! What are you doing with your life? I didn't raise you to be a dyke! Where are you going? Can't breathe. Stay with me. So we'll take a multi-platform approach, utilizing Youtube, Instagram and Snapchat to get the story across. I really like the new direction you've outlined for us. I just have some concerns. Yeah. Okay, Alex. Here's the thing. We've seen your work. It's good, we love it. Very film school. But at the same time. We fear that it might be too... Edgy. It might not translate. There are things that... Don't align with brand values. Why is there so much making out? This is not Serbis with Coco Martin, it's not some Gay indie film. I really wanted the lead to be the anti-thesis of the girls we see on television. Why can't a girl ask a guy out? Why can't a girl make the first move? Look, we like the concept. It's fresh, it's original. But? I think you need to tone it down a little, friend. Where's the coyness? Where's the demure? Make it more relatable. Needs more Kim Chiu. Yeah. Or more Sarah G. There are no kids here. There are no chicks. Guys, I'll go. Early night. I have a shoot tomorrow. Shoot tomorrow or she just finished hers? Alex, don't leave. I need a wingman. Julo will be your wingman. Make it up to you next week. Promise. Why'd you wait here? You're allowed inside. Too crowded. Plans tonight? I have a surprise for you. Let's go. Starfish are meant to fly? Is it weird? What? That you get everything you want. Not really. It's actually nice. When people are bored in traffic, they look at me. What about you? Do you find it weird? It must be hard to be your ex because you'll be everywhere. Now that there's an us you suddenly imagine the break up. Us? Aren't we? When you've wanted something for so long, and you never thought it could happen. But it's here now, bigger than you thought it would ever be. It's kinda scary to think what's gonna happen next. Boo! Okay. I'll show you my options for my new tattoo. Glamorous jellyfish, evil chihuahua, or... T-rex. I think T-rex is my favorite. Do you really Photoshop the tattoos before getting them? It's not Photoshop, it's an app. And sometimes it's really all I think about. Sometimes you're all I think about. How about you, Alex? Who's been on your mind? Alex, is Jess your girlfriend already? David, is Julo your boyfriend already? T-rex? Or does the jellyfish fit me better? The T-rex will ruin my brand. Just do the jellyfish. Jellyfish? In color or just in black? Okay. Not too loud. Okay, I'll take care of it. What's going on with you girl? What's up? - Hi, Mother. You're blooming, darling. The makeup artist you hired today is terrific. Really? I know who is making you happy. My family. My friends. You. This show. My career. You know, darling. I'm okay with it. I mean look at me. I'm not one to go against your desires. Your lifestyle. It's just that you have so many projects. Your career's on the line. But if that's what you want, and that's what you really are. Just not now. I'm kissing another sea monster. How many sea monsters do I have to kiss before they become Prince Charming? Darling, listen. There are actors who are drug addicts but their careers survive it. But you if they find out you're a tomboy, a dyke. Say goodbye to your career. Bye to all your endorsements. Bye, bye. Bye to building your dream house. Miss Jess, excuse me. We need you in the second unit. Thank you. Okay. How is she getting there? Carry her. You shouldn't have waited for me. Fuck! Ever heard of a bra? I thought you were a feminist. Not all lesbians are feminists. If you could only give me a child, I would marry you. Oh my god, fuck! I just ran a red light. Jess. Put this jacket on. Cover yourself up. Relax. - Put it on, now. Come on. Alex. Jess, do you always have to be so impulsive? Excuse me, but you just ran past a red light. Is your friend alright? Asthma attack. Oh, I see her on television. She's an actress. Yeah. I really like your magazine cover. So sexy. When you were wearing a black bikini. And you were holding a snake. I'll accompany you to the hospital. It's fine. We don't need an escort Sir. I can't leave, Miss. If anything happens to her, I won't forgive myself. We're okay. It's fine, thank you. You think the enforcer's gone? Let him be. He'll eventually get bored. Macel Camacho? That's me. Ma'am, there's an error in your form. How are you related to Miss Figuerres? She's my wife. Your wife? Are you sure? Okay. Can you come with me? Alex. Can you promise me that whatever happens we'll stay friends? Can you promise me that whatever happens, you'll give me time to deal? Deal? When you realize you're straight after all. When you wanna go back to boys. It's fine with me. I get it. I just need time. Do you still think I'm straight? You're the straightest straight girl I know. So what are we doing? I don't know either. Plans tonight? Depends. Depends what time her shoot ends? When did you become a gossip? It's tough to be back in the closet? Based on experience? I was never in the closet. You never really came out either. My mom keeps asking about you. She's interested in your love life. As long as I know who I am, it doesn't matter. And coming out, it's not just at one point. It's your whole life. But... Sometimes you just want someone else to know. Just to make sure it's real. That you're not making things up. So that when something ends, you can be sure that it actually happened. Yeah. But sometimes people don't deserve to know because they'll just ruin it. Okay, I'm good. Yeah. Let's shoot. Ready? Here we go. And- Chin up. - Change pose. I learned something new in our workshop. It's when your body does something different from what you're thinking. Like this? What's that? Didn't you feel that? I was holding your hand in my mind. Do it again. Excuse me, Miss Jess. This is your wardrobe. We already need you on the set. Okay. Just stay here. I'll be back. Okay. Alex, I think you need to leave. I'll just wait here for Jess. Jess has been distracted from work. I think you need to go. This is my best friend, Alex. MJ, Boni. Nice to meet you guys. Hold on, excuse me. Hey. My best friend, Alex. Hello. BJ is the photographer. These are his photographs. And this is me. Oh nice. I photoshopped your hair. Thank you. Congrats again. Congrats. Don. Hey, what's up? Just got here? Hello! This is Mik and Don. My best friend, Alex. I'm Don. Nice to meet you. Ready for the shoot? I'm always ready for you. Have you seen my costume? Almost naked. Skin to skin. Too bad, we're not going out of town. Let's have our honeymoon some other time. What are you saying? But it's just work. You're too busy these days. Hey, I'm always available for you. I'm giving you a reason to make time for me. What the hell was that? Is your schedule going to loosen up? When is this happening? Hold on. Alex, why did you leave? I'm tired. Okay, just a round of catching up. Then we'll leave. You were flirting with a boy right in front of me. Who? Don? He had a crush on me before. But we're just friends now. Like us? Not tonight, Alex. I'm working. It's embarrassing. You know it feels like I'm back in the closet again. But this time there are two people instead of one. It's dark. Can't move. Can't breathe. What do you want me to do? Alex. You know what you got yourself into. I knew it was gonna be like this, but I didn't know it was gonna feel like this. It's not fun anymore. Jess, don't. I'm actually really glad you're here cause- Okay? Cause I wanted to introduce you to my new boyfriend. We're dating. Seriously? Yup. Okay, let's take shots! Celebrate. - Okay. Yeah, let's celebrate. Okay, we're celebrating. Thanks. Cheers. To a new life. Congrats, guys. Thank you. Another round of shots, please. In five, four, three, two, one. Action. Attack! Stay away from us. You'll never conquer Dolphin Land. We won! Fly, sea monster, fly. Jess, I need to ask you something. Where did you see that? People are spreading it around. I had a crush on you before. But why didn't you tell me you're now with Alex? She's hot. It's not that easy. Because of what other people will say? Because I don't know what to tell them, when I'm not really sure of myself yet. Am I gay or bisexual? Or just a straight girl in love with her best friend? Hey, you have to tell yourself it's okay. Miss Jess, we're rolling again. Here is your weapon. Okay. Thanks for helping me pack. There's so much I have to get done, before I leave. Everything's so last minute. No problem. Just making up for- you know- being me. Okay, so there's a system. I've already labeled the boxes. One is for keeping and one is for throwing away. Okay? Okay. Okay, ready. Alex. Wrong box. I already gave you away, a long time ago. Packing break? I'm hungry. Just go home. Please. I need strength for- you know- lifting stuff. Okay, let's order in? Let's eat out. Smoked beef and rice. My weakness. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Remember what I told you on our first date? It was the most unromantic thing anyone has ever told me. At least it was honest. Honesty is romantic. I don't know if I'm in love with you or just the idea of you. It's been a year. Have you figured it out? Well, I was in love with the idea of you, but somewhere along the way. I fell in love with you. Sometimes I wish we didn't get together just yet. Maybe now, maybe in five years we could've worked. When you no longer have to keep me a secret? When you no longer have to keep you a secret. Alex. Bad day? Wait, I was supposed to tell you something. Don't panic. Because- there's a picture of us going around. I've seen it and we look really cute. It made me realize we're a good match. Jess. We can fix this. I'll do an interview. We'll have to hide and be more careful. You understand, right? Jess, I think we should be friends. Friends-friends. Yeah, that's right. We can fix this. Sometimes at four in the morning- and I'm crying for a living, feeling sleepy and hungry. Feeling cold. I remember I'm living my dream. I got what I want. I'm complete. Alex, I've never been this happy. Don't you feel the same way? There's always something missing. We always want something more. Alex, that's you. You're my something more. Jess, that's not true. I'm your nothing. Isn't that the point? That I'm invisible. I don't exist. I'm just something that's not gonna happen. Jess, I'm your best friend. Alex. I don't care what everyone else thinks. We can't have everything. You want me but you want your career. I want you but. I want to tell everyone about you. What we want doesn't exist. Not yet. Alex. Don't worry, it's gonna be okay. You probably won't hear from me for a while. Sixty days? After that, we can be friends again. Like magic. Like nothing ever happened. Oh, Alex. Long time, no see. I've been here this whole time, Mom. You're always at home lately. Are you single again? We broke up. You and Jess? Alex, you don't have to hide anymore. It's okay. I love you, Alex. I love you so much. Can you promise me that whatever happens, you'll give me time to deal... Have you talked? Not yet. Even after-What?-60 days. I'm on Day 78. So nothing? Like magic. Like nothing ever happened. Do you think you'll ever be friends again? We were never really just friends. You did what was best for her. I did what was best for me. Okay. So don't forget, the plumber arrives at 9am. Rent is due on the 10th and the 25th. And the bathroom lock needs to be replaced. Okay. - Okay? Okay. My keys to moving on. I used to think there was a ritual to moving on. But you know what I realized? True love never gets left behind. Like me? You can't stand to leave me? Alex, you're not my true love. We were just each other's... In-betweens. You loved me even before I was lovable. Still not lovable. But you're getting there. I need to go back to my shoot. Okay. Bye. Miss Alex, they're ready for you. Happy birthday Julo. Happy birthday to me. Speech! Speech, Oh my god. - Come on, give a speech. Okay. Thank you, all, for coming out to celebrate my birthday. I want everyone to drink up. No one's going home sober. Let's get drunk. Or a virgin. So please have fun tonight. And those hearts with my face and David's, you can take those home. No don't take those home. It's expensive. Happy birthday. Look who's stuck in their honeymoon stage? Yeah. Even after a year. Yeah. It's my birthday. Hey! Hey. It's my birthday so I invited her. Hi. Alex. Happy birthday. Thank you. Hi. I have to say. Your magazine cover, so beautiful. Of course, you styled it. Hi. Hi. Plans tonight? Nothing. Just this. Just this? Just this.
