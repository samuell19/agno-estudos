[dramatic orchestral music playing] [whooshing] [music box being wound] [music box playing gentle tune] [coughs] I'm sorry, Marta. I'm afraid it's not good news. Tell me everything. I beg of you. You have "mucoviscibosis." - For goodness. - [music fades] - Mucoviscidosis! - Yes, what you said. That's exactly it. How long do I have left? More or less three minutes because then the cartoons begin. In that case, before I leave you, I want to tell you a secret. [gentle music playing] Here. I must tell you that... [groans] It will remain unresolved. Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! - Tell us! - [Marta laughing] NETFLIX PRESENTS ["SuL Più BeLLo" playing] [Marta] You know all those fairy tales little girls get told about caterpillars that will eventually become butterflies? In the end, I stayed a caterpillar. - How long do I have left? Shh. - [both] What the fuck? There's more dignity in being rejected by someone out of my league. [Marta] No. A dinner date. And if we don't click, I promise I'll leave you alone. - [Arturo] Let's do it. - I have a dinner date with Arturo Selva! [giggles wildly] But we'll definitely do it? Of course we'll do it. I'd like to know the truth. Am I the ugliest girl you've gone with? Now there's only one option left. A transplant. I'M SORRY We could go precisely when we're at our best. [song fades] [Marta] Hello, everyone. It's been a year. - [whimsical music playing] - [Marta] Twelve months that... I don't know about you, but for me, they just seemed to drag on unbearably. Maybe because, in the end, they were all the same. I can't even do a list because it would be way too short. [Marta] But let's try. Turin is always the same. Wonderful and unchanging. Jacopo and Federica are always the same efficient guardian angels. The muco is always lurking, waiting for a nice transplant that sooner or later will come. I can feel it. Basically, you know... [sighs] ...everything's been the friggin' same. Actually, no. There is something different. Well... Oh, I don't really know how to tell you. Okay. Are you sitting down? Things with Arturo, unfortunately, didn't work out. But don't feel sorry for me because, well, I'm the one who left him. - It's true! - [lively music playing] [Marta] Thing is, we were really different. And I think I did him a favour too because, guys, let's face it, opposites attract, but, in the end, they break up. Oh! Where are my manners? Excuse me. The mayonnaise-and-ketchup-flavoured guy is Gabriele. I met him about three months ago. - [birds singing] - [Marta] Twenty-seven years old. Graduated with honours in painting and scenography at the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts. For now, he does a few odd jobs while waiting for his big break. I believe this is yours. Thank you. I'm sorry. You're welcome. May I? No, no. Please. Your drawings are beautiful. [majestic orchestral music playing] - [Marta] You'll think, "Super creepy." - [Gabriele chuckles] [Marta giggling] I thought, "Super romantic!" [Gabriele grunting playfully] [Marta] Gabriele was funny. [Gabriele clears throat] - [Marta] Gabriele was sweet. - [Gabriele chuckles sheepishly] [Marta] Gabriele was very, very determined. [Gabriele] Good morning. [birds singing outside] Hey. Understood. You already regret it. Okay, I'll be on my way. Regret? Me? Come back to bed immediately. [giggles] [Gabriele takes a deep breath] I guess by now you know that... I like you a lot. You can't say that! - No? - Well, no! You must pretend to be disinterested to maintain control. Then you express a generic interest, but that's only optional. - [Gabriele] Hmm? - It's just to test the waters. And only then you should go for the grand reveal. Uh, I didn't know. - Wow. That's so much work. Hey. - [both chuckle] Oh well. It's too late now. So, I was saying, I like you a lot. [gentle music playing] [Marta] Hmm. - What's wrong? - [sombre music playing] Are you sure you're not fazed by my illness? No, it does worry me. Of course it does. But for sure it won't be the muco stopping me. - [gentle music playing] - [Marta chuckles softly] Okay. Can you now tell me what's really going on? [Marta sighs] [takes a deep breath] It... It's that I've just come out of a pretty... Of an important relationship. Now, that worries me way more than the muco. [sighs] And you're still not over it. No. That's not the case. I'm the one who broke up with him. Mm-hmm. And what was he like? [gentle music playing] It was him. Wow. You left this guy? Right. [laughs] - Moron. - Come on. [both laugh] Sleeping with his photo above your head is not exactly going to do us any favours. Well, I didn't remove the photo because, on this wall, there's pretty much all my life. - And Arturo was part of... - [mockingly] "Arturo." What a crap name. [both laugh] Listen. In my personal experience, it takes a while to clear up after certain skeletons. Therefore, before we hurt ourselves, maybe it's best to give up now. Okay? Good idea. Goodbye, Gabriele. Goodbye, Marta. [whimsical music playing] [Marta] Okay. Consistency wasn't our forte. [birds singing] - Mm. Ta-da! - [Marta] We spent a lot of time together. [food splats] [Marta] After a month, I'd already become his muse. I don't know how, but, for the first time, everything was working perfectly. [Gabriele] Don't! Stay still. - [Marta thuds] - [Gabriele chuckles] - [Gabriele] What about the cinema tonight? - [Marta] Yeah. Why not? My choice or yours? [gentle version of "SuL Più BeLLo" playing] Hey. [group speaking indistinctly] - Hey. - Ah? - Everything all right? - Um, yeah. Yeah. [spluttering] It's nothing. I thought I'd seen Arturo. This is his parents' favourite restaurant. Oh. Is it any good? I've no idea. [giggling] We ran away before the appetisers. I took him to eat frozen pizza at the supermarket. [laughs] But then we started playing "would I lie to you?" - Playing what? - Nothing. It's just a silly game. We had five questions each and one lie wildcard. Okay. Take this, then. Call him and ask him to take you back. [splutters] But how many times do I have to tell you I left him? - Why does nobody believe me? - [Gabriele sighs] Seriously. Look at me. You have no reason to fear anyone. And do you know why? - Here she goes again. - Yes, I'm going again, my dear. - [gentle piano music playing] - [both sigh] You have absolutely no reason to fear anyone. Because you also love making lists, like me. Because you are extraordinarily messed up, yet you solve everything with a smile. And heck, it's the most beautiful smile that was ever created. [chuckles] [music fades] Not forgetting you... kiss like a god. - [whimsical music playing] - [Marta giggles] [whimsical music building] [Marta laughs] - Did Picasso go home? - [Marta grunts, spits] Guys, you didn't like my ex. You don't like this one either. It's beginning to sound like jealousy. You're wrong, dear. I'm not jealous. If anything, I envy you. - I haven't had sex in months. - [Federica] Mm. There's a new app called Drool you can download. - How elegant. - [Marta laughs] Okay. At least, are we going out tonight? I have a good feeling. I can't tonight. I have poker with the countess. I can't either. I'm going out with Gabriele. [chuckles] [Jacopo spits] Talking about Gabriele, we can tell you're cute together. - And we're very happy for you guys. - [Marta] Mm. - But maybe it's a bit too early? Eh? - Mm, no. Do not listen to her. One boyfriend drives away another. Also, life is short, so enjoy it. Okay, I'm a total cock. [upbeat music playing] [PA chimes] [in sultry voice] Dear customers... [over PA] ...the supermarket will close in a few minutes. We kindly invite you to complete your purchases and head for the counters. Thank you for choosing us today. We wish you a good evening and a rocking weekend to you. [flicks switch] [takes a deep breath] - [tense music playing] - [quietly] Dammit. Why is he early? Ugh, fate, you cruel bitch. [lively music playing] [takes a deep breath] [crickets chirping] Okay. What are we celebrating? Nothing. We're not celebrating anything. I just wanted to spend the night with a beautiful girl. Aww. But since they were all busy, here we are. You moron! [both laugh] [sighs] I love this place. Well, I'm fairly sure it loves you too. Hmm. Jeez. Someone's being super sweet tonight. What's going on? [Gabriele takes a deep breath, sighs] What's going on is... [gentle piano music playing] ...I've never known anyone like you. Because you are... intelligent, funny, selfless... - [Gabriele sighs] - [quietly] Didn't you forget something? [Gabriele chuckles] You are beautiful. So beautiful that I would depict you a thousand times more. Okay. Now besides muco, I'm also getting diabetes. [both chuckle] - [Marta sighs] - [Gabriele sighs] - Well, then, what did you want to tell me? - [Gabriele] Uh... - [pours drink] - Gabriele De Marchi. One of the things I like most about you is that you are so incredibly and wonderfully transparent. So much so that at one of Federica's poker nights, you wouldn't last five minutes. Come on. [chuckles] Tell Marta. Okay, um... [sniffles] Mm... I have had a job offer. What? Pour me some cheap wine right now. Well, hold on. Um... I said no. But why? It was a shitty job, then? No, actually. It was wonderful. Um... Assistant set designer for a TV series. But it's a contract for ten months, and it's in Paris, which is, um, quite far away. [chuckles, sighs] [sombre piano music playing] [Gabriele exhales] But the good news is, is that they chose me, right? For the first time, they chose me and not someone else, so... so this has definitely given me a supercharge. [upbeat piano music playing] What's wrong? What are you doing? Now, you call them right back, and you tell them that you were wrong. [sighs] No. Come on. Why? You tell them you have an understanding and most wonderful girlfriend who's certainly not scared to have a long-distance relationship. That she's entrusting them with her boyfriend for ten very long months, and... as long as... they send you back as happy as you are now. [sighs] I know. I'm amazing. [chuckles] [music fades] Are you sure? Never have I been more sure. Ten months will fly. [Gabriele] Hmm. - [Marta chuckles] - [music continues] [music fades] [countess] Call. [tense music playing] Fold. Raise. Fold. What are you doing? I say fold. Fold, dammit. [tense music stops abruptly] We're here to play, right? [tense music resumes] All in. Come on, Mauro. She's just a little girl. Little girl, my arse. Call. [tense music stops abruptly] Flush. Four queens. [players groan] [tense music resumes] [man groans] Right. Ah. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry, but it's getting late. - This little girl needs her beauty sleep. - [man sighs] [tense music fades] Thank you very much. This is for you. - Thank you. - [Federica chuckles] [Federica exhales] Can I offer you a ride? Thanks for the thought, but with what I've won tonight, I can afford to hire a helicopter. [both chuckle] True. You've played well. It's just luck. There is no luck. Especially in cards. - [Federica sighs] - You count the cards. - [tense music playing] - That's just nonsense. I've watched you. You kept your bets low throughout the course of the evening. And then, when you harvested enough data about us, about our habits, hmm, and about our reactions, then you acted. You knew I was aiming for the flush. And you bluffed, asking for the check, even when you had the game in the bag with the queens. You have a mathematical mind. It's a rare thing. Well, then, what are you going to do? Expose me to the countess? [laughing] No. I want to offer you a job.

So why don't we share all of our news together? - Go. - One... two... three. - I found a suitor. - I found a job! Gabriele is going to move to France. [dramatic piano music playing] For ten months. What now? And now nothing. We'll have a long-distance relationship. Like many other couples. [sighs] So, what do you guys think? [Jacopo sighs] Well, you got dumped by this one too. It was me that broke up with Arturo. I did. You know? Hmm? [gentle music playing] And we are not breaking up. [sighs] It wasn't like he even wanted to leave! It was me who pushed him and, in the end, convinced him. You convinced him? Yes. And how did he take it? Good. How was he supposed to take it? [chuckling] I mean, it's only been three months. Let's consider it a test. Wow, it's going to be really interesting to see how it turns out. [sighs] Oh well. Shall we celebrate? I really don't think there's anything to celebrate.

[laughs sarcastically] Funny. - You know... - Hold that a minute. [indistinct chatter] [Vittorio] Marta. - Hey. - You gonna introduce me? - Of course. Gabriele, this is... - [Vittorio] Vittorio. Arturo's best friend. Who just happens to be on his way. You don't mind, do you? - [Marta chuckles] - [Vittorio scoffs] Come on. I'm joking. But I made you look.

So don't ask her for photos, posts, or whatever else. Okay? - Let's party. - Thank you. Also, because they would be 5,000 euros each. - [Gabriele] Hmm? - [Marta] Mm-hmm. [woman 3] Hey! Over here! Hey. Hiya. Hiya. This is Gabriele, my boyfriend. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm Gabriele. - I'm going to get a drink. - [Federica] Go on. Explain to me why we got rid of Arturo but we kept all of his sad-ass friends. I've got no idea. [wolf-whistle alert sounding] [gasps] Sorry. You scared the hell out of me. I know. I have that effect on people. - By the way, I'm Giacomo. - Hi. Fuck my life. Look how busy the bar is. I'd do anything for a mojito. Here you go. Oh. Thank you. [splutters] When you said you'd do anything... - I have my limits. - What limits? Let's talk about it. [Rebecca sighs] - [alert chimes] - [wolf-whistle alert sounding] YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE [wolf-whistle alerts overlapping] [song fades] Have you got everything? Almost everything.

[gentle music playing] FOR MARTA - [Marta] No way. It's an open ticket. - [Gabriele] Mm-hmm. How'd you manage it? It must have cost a bomb. You... I'll wait for you in Paris. Okay.

[chuckles] No. No, no, no, no, no. You're massively talking out your arse. [Rebecca sighs] [quirky music playing] [under breath] Bollocks. Now I remember. The mojito. That turned into lots. And then I had this really stiff neck, and it hurt like hell, and so you said to me... [both] "I'm very good at giving massages." - Oh no! - [Giacomo chuckles] It actually happened! [sobs] My life is completely over! [crying] Uh, but don't cry. It was really nice. For you! [Rebecca sobs weakly] If you want, I won't tell anyone. - [gentle music playing] - Would you really do that? Course I would. No chance anyone's believing me. - [both chuckle] - Yeah, right. And who would believe you? [sighs, chuckling] Okay. Okay. Phew. I'm safe. It's fine. Ah. [Rebecca grunts] Turn around. I said, turn around! [takes a deep breath] Okay. - [indistinct chatter] - I'm going to be so lonely, you know? [sighs] I can imagine.

[sighs, chuckles] - [gentle music fades] - [mysterious music playing] Wow. [Mauro] I've been looking for an ethical hacker for a while now. A what? An ethical hacker. Someone trusted. Able to test computer security systems by simulating attacks and intrusions. Basically, you're looking for a criminal. Should I be offended? No. On the contrary, you should be flattered. The role of the ethical hacker will soon become an indispensable function for any company. And anyone who's able to do this job well has a career guaranteed. My money's on you. Because I count cards at pensioners' poker? Let's be honest. I don't even have a degree. I honestly don't think I'm qualified for this job. In my opinion, a degree's not worth the paper it's written on if, behind it, there isn't a person who's smart and sharp as you are. And if things go as planned, at the end of your internship here, I may have won the bet, but it'll be a win for everyone involved. Don't you think? Shall we? Yes. [indistinct chatter] So, welcome to your workstation. Meet Silvia and Cristina. Girls, this is Federica. She'll be working here from today. If you need anything, I'm in the office next to Delfina's. - Have a good day. - Thank you. - Who's Delfina? - Let's start by reading this. Um, excuse me. - Do you know the password? - No. Thank you. You're very kind. Mm, let's try "password." [sighs] There you go. If I really was a hacker, we'd be fucked already. - Coffee? - Yeah. That'd be great.

What was the name of that new soup restaurant we wanted to try out? It's called "So Soup Me." - Order for three. - Okay. Okay. Done. Where's Jacopo? Dunno. Is he out? Come to think of it, I haven't seen him for the past 24 hours. [ominous music playing] [Jacopo gasps] Have you been stuck in here in the dark all day? [Jacopo takes a deep breath] Okay. You've got arms. I've got legs. [music fades] [Jacopo grunts] My name is Jacopo. I'm 20 years old, and I spend 16 hours a day on Drool. [both] Hello, Jacopo. I've chatted with 379 guys in the past two days. It's a full-time job. I'm not joking. I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. I haven't washed, because if I get distracted, I might miss the notification that will change my life. [wolf-whistle alert sounds] No. Enough. [gentle music playing] Um, maybe it's time to start meeting them in real life. Trust me, as a girl who had a hard time giving up the keyboard. But I've actually already met some of them in person. But now I get confused with names, faces, and stories. - [tense music playing] - It's nice to meet in person. - Even though I liked messaging you. - [Jacopo chuckles] I have to say that, um, I never opened up to anyone like I did with you. Our chats have left an impression on me too. I assure you, Marco. Huh? Uh... Who is Marco? Look, let me tell you, your photo doesn't do you justice. - You look younger than you are. - Ah. I thought you were 35, tops. But I'll be 26 in July. You know, Jacopo, after our discussion, I thought you wouldn't want to meet in person. - Oh, come on. I couldn't wait. - Well, that's good. So, you changed your mind about S&M play on ketamine? [music fades out] [Jacopo sighs] Bill, please. I need to slow down. No, you just need a secretary. And since Gabriele isn't here, I've got some free time. No, thanks. I'm so done with guys. - [hands fall on knees] - [doorbell rings] I'll get it. [Marta sighs] ["Breaking Point" playing] ♪ I don't want you... ♪ Here's your soup. I'm sorry about the wait. ♪ To work all day... ♪ That's everything, yeah? Yes. That all looks perfect. - ♪ I just wanna make love to you... ♪ - [deliveryman] Hmm. So, enjoy your meal. And thank you for choosing So Soup Me. Thank you. - [awkwardly] Bye. - ♪ Love to you ♪ - [Jacopo] Son of a... - [song ends] Mm. Yay. We really needed something to warm us up. [chuckles] You're telling me? - [upbeat music playing] - [Jacopo sighs] So then, Marta, are you well? Yes. I had a bit more coughing and a bit of a fever, but now I'm better. And why is that? I haven't the faintest idea. Oh, yeah. I ran out of mucolytics. I skipped them for a day. Okay, four and a half days. But now everything's back to normal. It's just that, with Gabriele leaving, I lost track of things. Marta, I cannot keep on telling you. You mustn't let your guard down. Ever. [ambulance siren blaring outside] Anyway... I have to give you some news that, for once, is not about you but about me. I'm retiring from next week. But you can't do that. Haven't you thought about me, then? [chuckles] Little Marta, we've been through so much together, huh? But now I feel it's my time to recharge and slow down. I'm no spring chicken, and, uh... But at least stay until I die. Surely, it won't take that long, right? I hope you'll have all the time in the world. Anyway, to show you that I thought about you, I leave you in the capable hands of the good Doctor Caponi. [chuckles] Pleasure, Marta. Doctor Caponi knows everything about you. He will follow your progress on the waiting list for the transplant. You'll see. You'll be just fine. Doctor. Retirement is very boring. You will end up feeding pigeons, looking at building sites, doing crossword puzzles. Think about it. - Thanks for everything. - Yeah. Goodbye, then. - See you. - [door opens] - What do we know? He might be amazing. - He's definitely hotter. Did you see him? He's, like, 15 years old. He hasn't even grown a beard yet. Where did he graduate? Disneyland? Chin up. I've seen your medical records. Considering your past behaviour, you'll not need to see me for long. [Marta chuckles] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. It's just that I have a very close bond with the other doctor, and... [Caponi] No, Marta. I am not your friend and never will be. Get a priest if you want a shoulder to cry on. Here, I work to extend your life for you. Foolish of me. I naively expect a patient to be on board. [lift bell rings] Anyway, really, I don't know how long you have left to live, but I suggest you don't waste time looking for the ultimate comeback. [sombre music playing] [Jacopo sighs] Anyway, having seen your track record, before bad-mouthing someone, you might want to take a look around. [upbeat music playing] [door opens] - [Giacomo] Hi. - What are you doing here? These aren't for me, right? Of course, they're for you. Listen, I thought I'd been very clear with you, okay? Whatever happened, happened. It was even quite nice, but that's enough! Tell me the truth. Are you embarrassed by me? Yes. Yes. - I'm embarrassed by you. - [man] Oh, nice roses. [woman laughing] Yes! You never give me flowers. I was right! [laughs] You are, uh, the hundredth girl to turn me down, but you are the first to be completely honest with me, though. I really mean it. By being honest with me, you are showing me enormous respect. - [Rebecca] Hmm. - I was right. You are special. Giacomo? There are three rules. Number one, in public, you and I don't know each other. Number two, no photos, no hashtags, no posts. You can't even afford them. Number three, I dump you when I want, and you leave without a fuss. Okay? I'm in. And those three rules, they... work both ways. [Rebecca chuckles softly] Sorry. [laughs] [takes a deep breath] It's a deal, you stallion. [calming music playing] - [vendor, in French] Good evening. - No, thank you. Oh, sir. Excuse me. - I take this one? - Yes. - How much? - [vendor] Five euros. [in English] Okay. - [in French] Thank you very much. - Thank you. [music swells] HERE I HAVE FULL BARS. I'M READY FOR THE SURPRISE. HEADPHONES ON, VOLUME UP. [call alert sounding] [laptop chimes] [in English] Hey. Hi? I can't see you if you're in the dark. ["Je t'aime... moi non plus" playing] [Gabriele laughs] [roommate 1, in French] Coming for a beer, Gabriele? [Marta screams] - [music cuts out] - [spluttering] Oh, um... [in English] Yes? [in French] Coming for a beer? Yes, one minute. Well, this is Marta, my girlfriend. - Bonjour. - [roommates, in English] Hi, hi. [in French] You coming? Yes, I'll be there now. - Okay. We'll wait for you outside. - Thanks. - [roommate 2] Mm-hmm. - [speaking French] [Gabriele laughs] Hey, thanks for the surprise. [laughing] It was... It was a real surprise. Look, can we talk later? I'm on my way out for a beer now. Oh, all right. I also have to tell you about this new doctor. Right! How did it go? Well, I'll just say that we nicknamed him "The Shit." [laughing] Okay. Okay. All right. We'll talk later. Bye. [kisses] [call disconnects] [Marta sighs] What a complete waste of time. So, how was the tête-à-tête? It was a tête-à-everybody. [Marta huffs] I'm hungry. - [doorbell rings] - Stop. - I'll get it. - Well, I certainly can't answer it. - [door opens] - [Jacopo] Oh! - Look who's here. Come in. - Uh, yeah. May I? [deliveryman sighs] I'm pleased you liked the soup. It doesn't always have that effect. You don't know the effect your soup has. Do you work every day? No, only Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Oh. Good. [chuckles] Well, at least you have some time to chill out for a while, do a bit of sport, go out with your girlfriend... [chuckles] What girlfriend? I've only just moved to Turin. I'm pretty much on my own. Ah. [lively music playing] So... what you waiting for? - The soup, it gets cold. - [Jacopo laughs] Yes! The soup, eh? [chuckles] Enjoy your meal. - Bye. - [deliveryman] Bye. Bye. [sighs] Okay. I'm coming out. Again? I love the guy from So Soup Me. Mm, we might have had an inkling. [upbeat music playing] - [giggles] Which team does he bat for? - How would I know? Mm, you're lucky, my dear. You have a professional stalker in front of you, eh? Come on. Tell us everything you know about him. Get writing! Okay, so... His name is Tommy. I think it's short for Tommaso. And he only works three days a week, he's new to Turin, and he's so handsome. - [quietly] Handsome. Put that down. - [Jacopo] Look. Even your cousin has a boyfriend. - What boyfriend? - I don't know. That's odd. She hasn't said anything to me. He's gotta be a footballer, millionaire, and beautiful. [sultry music playing] - [Giacomo exhales] - Wow. [sighs] [softly] Wow. Take that look off your face right now. I do not know what you're on about. That look. Where did you learn how to do all that? Films, books, comics. Mainly films, though. I'm totally exhausted. Can you get me some water? Don't worry. I thought of everything. [Giacomo grunts] [both laughing] Mm. What time is it? Oh. It's eleven. Fuck, I had to tag the new Nikes! - Hey. I can tag you right now. - [sultry music resumes] Listen, you really have to lay off those crap jokes. They're completely awful. Okay. Good morning, ladies. - Sugar? - Yes, please. [Federica sighs] [Mauro] Okay, I get it. - [knocking on door] - Come in. Bye. - Have you got a minute? - [Mauro] Of course. Of course. I was on the phone to Delfina. Unfortunately, she can't make it to the convention this month. Too bad. I wanted to introduce you. Please. Thank you. So, talk to me. Um... [Mauro] Let me help you out. Silvia and Cristina are behaving like total bitches. I haven't come to ask you to help me. Trust me, I can handle them on my own. I came to talk to you because... because... You want to know why they've been behaving like that in the first place. [Federica] Mm-hmm. It's nothing personal. Believe me. To tell you the truth, you're not the first. Before you, there was Marinella, then Michela, then Irene. They all lasted a month and then couldn't wait to get out of here quick enough. I'm sorry, but if you're aware of the problem, why don't you fire them? Uh, because, basically, the company needs them. At least until we find someone who's as good as them, if not... even better. Do you understand what I mean? [intriguing music playing] Perfectly. - [rain pattering] - Do you understand? They're marking their territory. With me. [chuckles] Hmm. Poor things. They have no idea who they're up against. [thunder rumbles] But something's not quite right. [mobile phone chimes] [thunder rumbles in distance] Oh, for heaven's sake. The power went out at the office. I have to make sure the servers haven't been damaged. - What? In this weather? - Yeah. [exhales] Okay. - Have a nice virtual dinner. - Thank you. [Marta sighs] - [door unlocks] - But tonight, no soup. - Let's have a look. - [door closes] Pizza. [lively music playing] [doorbell rings] [Marta splutters] Uh, coming! [thunder rumbles] Oh my God. - I mean, hey! - [chuckles] Hi. Hi! [laughs] Looks like you've changed restaurants. - [Marta giggles] - Yes, I work for the pizza place now. Look at you. You're gonna catch your death. You're soaked through. Oh, well. Occupational hazard. Do you want to come in? I can lend you a T-shirt. Don't worry. It's nearly stopped. And I have other deliveries to do, so... Come on, really, I insist. We can't have you getting ill, you know? Come in. All right. May I? [door opens] [gentle music playing] [Marta] Here, you can wear this. - Have you known each other long? - Yeah. Seems like forever. They're basically my family. In Calabria, I had a group of friends like yours. I miss them a lot. We video call every now and then, but it's not the same. Ah, shit. The dinner. I have something really important to do. You can get changed wherever you'd like. Okay. [playful instrumental music playing] Okay. Uh, maybe get changed next door. - [Marta chuckles] - Uh... - Yeah. [chuckles, sighs] - [call alert sounding] [laptop chimes] Hey! - How are you? - [chuckles] Ah, I'm great. Oh. So I see. Clearly. Ah, yeah. This is Tommaso. [giggles] Hi. Sorry for the interruption. Uh, Marta, thank you so much. I'll be off now. Bye. Ah. Uh, wait a mo... Wait a second. [chuckles] Leave it. I'll wash it, and you can collect it when you come and bring this one back. - [Tommaso] All right. Thanks. - [Marta chuckles] - [Tommaso] I'll leave you my number, then. - [Marta] Okay. - [Tommaso] Bye. - [Marta] Bye. [Marta giggles] - [door closes] - [Gabriele] So? Who was that? Tommaso, the deliveryman. [giggles] And you gave him my T-shirt? Yeah, but it's for a good cause. Jacopo has a massive crush on him, and we're trying to figure out which team he bats for. So that's why you were flirting with him. I was not flirting. [dramatic piano music playing] What's up? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just that it's hard being apart. Listen, when are you going to come and see me? You're right. I'm so sorry. It's just, at work, everyone's ill with the flu. It's a mess. I want to stay with you for at least a week. [quietly] I get it. Shall we eat? [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [women scream] - [all panting] - [Silvia sighs] Fuck! It's you two. [both] Fuck, it's you. There was a power outage, and I came to check the emergency generator had kicked in. Don't worry. We've already turned it back on. You can go back to kissing Mauro's bottom. Uh, can we get this over with? - [thunder rumbles] - What over with? This game where you are bitches, and I have to sit here, domesticating you? I think we can sort this out like grown-ups. Don't you? Man cave? - [both] Man cave. - [Federica] After you. [rock version of superhero theme playing] Come on, Silvia! Come on, Silvia! Go, go! Good. Keep it up. Yes. Yes, yes! Come on, Silvia! Come on! We can still do it! Keep going! Just like that! Come on! Come on! - Focus! No! - [Federica] Yes! - [Cristina] No, no! - ♪ Bing-bum-bum-bum ♪ ♪ Bing-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum ♪ I let you win, okay? How very kind of you. Hmm. You're not that bad. At foosball? Or in general? Ladies, enough. I know everything. About Irene, Marinella, Michela. - How do you know? - [Federica] I know. - I just want to know why. - Because they were pretty, I suppose. So much for women's solidarity, then. You forced them out of the office just because they were pretty? Wait. Did Mauro tell you all this? - [Federica] Yeah. - [Cristina sighs] [sombre music playing] [Cristina] This is a voice message from Irene. She left it six months ago. [phone clicks] [Irene, shakily] I can't take it any more. He touches me all over. When I tell him no, he keeps saying I'm not committed enough to the job. He threatens me. [sighs] I'm so tired. I'm sorry, girls. I adore you. [Silvia] He always uses the same system. And the same words. "In order to start thinking about what the company can do for you..." "You have to think about what you can do for the company." - Why don't you report him? - [Silvia] We don't have any evidence. His threats are always subtle. The sort of things that a court would label as "inappropriate banter but not criminally relevant." And then we would not only lose our job, but we'd struggle to get a new one. I'll give you some advice. Whenever you're alone with him, always leave the door open. All men are bastards. - [Cristina] Steer clear of them. - That's fine by me. I'm a lesbian. [both laugh] Lucky you. [upbeat music playing] [Marta] Jacopo, I have a present for you. [music fades] Were you born in a fucking barn? Don't you knock? Uh, but I brought you a gift. [chuckles] A used T-shirt? But it's not just any used T-shirt. [chuckles] Guess who it belongs to. Soup-man? [Marta giggling] Mm-hmm. This is a holy shroud. Ah. How did you get it? Yesterday, I ordered a pizza, but he showed up. Apparently, he changed restaurants. Anyway, it was pouring, and he was soaked, so I lent him a T-shirt, and he left this one behind to dry. [giggles] But this means that... That he can arrange to come over and pick it up. And he gave me his personal phone number. No way. You're a genius. - [giggles] I know. - [Jacopo] Okay. Now we just have to find out whether he's one of mine or one of yours. [Marta chuckles] - [doorbell rings] - Coming! [Jacopo sighs, gasps] - [Jacopo exhales] - [lively music playing] - Hi. - Uh, hey. Sorry to turn up unannounced, but I had a delivery in your building. I brought your T-shirt back. Ah! Uh, good! [chuckling] I'll go and get yours. Mm. [Marta sighs] - Give that here. - What are you doing? - I have to give it back to him. - It's my present! He's right there! [music fades] [Marta sighs] [Marta sniffs] [quietly] What's the smell? It's a fabric softener I make by mixing lavender extract and goji berries. [Marta] Definitely gay. [lively music playing] There you are. Here's your T-shirt. It's a bit crumpled, but... Uh, don't worry. Please, and thanks. [Marta chuckles] Would you like to go out sometime? [Marta] Hmm. Maybe he's straight. That okay? Well, I mean, I'm a bit busy at the moment. You know what I mean? Uh, I... I really... If you really want me to? No. No, sorry. I was being pushy. How about tomorrow? Uh, that's great. Is eight o'clock any good? Uh, eight o'clock is fine. [chuckles] - See you tomorrow, then. - [Marta] See you tomorrow. Bye. - Why did you make me say yes? - 'Cause I'm coming too. ["Come Va" playing] [speaking inaudibly] [Marta sighs] Still nothing from Paris? He's not online. [sighs] We didn't speak yesterday, either. - Mobile? - Switched off. [doorbell rings] He's early. Fuck, I'm not ready. Entertain him! [music fades out] - Okay. - ["Come Va" continues playing] Bonsoir. - [Marta] It's you! - [music swells] If the mountain won't come to Mohammed... Ah. That'll be the wrong boyfriend, then. Hello to you too, Jacopo. What wrong boyfriend? Uh, Tommaso. The delivery guy. Tonight, we were supposed to go out with him to find out if he's straight or gay. Someone here is in love. [chuckles] Ah, then I apologise if I've messed up your plans. [Jacopo sighs] Don't you think about it. Uh, so would you... would you mind if we went out on a double date together? - [kisses] - [kisses] [singing "Kobra" in Italian] [Marta and Jacopo singing along] Ha! - Jacopo, could you move to the other side? - Uh, yeah, sorry. Do you want to sit here? - Yes. - [Tommaso] Uh, sit. [woman continues singing "Kobra" in Italian] Gabriele, I hear you live in Paris. It's not been long. Ah. [in French] The Ville Lumière is wonderful. I would love to live in Paris to enjoy the pleasures of life and lead a life of my choosing. [in English] It's fast, but I know what you mean. I must say, you were very good. How many languages do you speak? Uh, five. Well, how wonderful. I love a man with an agile tongue. [Marta laughs loudly] I've always wanted to learn French too. It's just that good courses are very expensive. But you've got me. And don't worry about the price. It's on the house. Tommaso, have you ever been to the karaoke? Never. I actually only ever sing in the shower. [chuckles] - [emcee] Bravo! - Ha! [crowd cheering] [woman] Excellent! But, uh, my mantra is to try everything at least once in your life. - [emcee] Don't be shy! - So, thank you, Marta. Ah, it's good, this mantra of yours. Well, in that case, why don't you give it a go tonight? You know what? You're right, my friend. Allow me. Mind if I choose the song? Sure. - [emcee] Choose the song you want. - Come here. [Jacopo] Trouble brewing. [emcee] Whoa. Challenging song. Let's see how our tenor copes with it. ["Nessun dorma" playing] [singing timidly in Italian] [clears throat] [singing quietly] [feedback squeals] [continues singing timidly] [singing more confidently] [continues singing, projecting loudly] He's good! [giggles] [music building] [music swells] [Jacopo] Bravo! [crowd cheering] [Tommaso sighs] - He's an angel. - [Marta sighs] [emcee] Once more! Encore! Encore! Whoo! [song fades] He's so lovely. And he has that Southern accent. It's too sweet. - [Jacopo and Marta chuckle] - He really is Barbie 'Nduja. [Marta chuckles] Why can't I get the Wi-Fi password to work? Ah, because I changed it. Now it's "GabriMarta2021." [Gabriele] Hmm. So? Tommaso? Gay or not? Dunno. But we've discovered that he's an amazing tenor. Guys, he's not gay. - How do you know? - Simple. Because he likes you. Me? Are you kidding? He wouldn't look twice at someone like me. [Federica mouthing] [sombre piano music playing] [Gabriele scoffs, sighs] [Marta] Hey. Even if that was the case, I only have eyes for you. [quietly] Mm-hmm. Okay. Hey. Look, I know the effect good-looking guys have on you. [sighs] We both know how things with those guys end up. Okay. Anyway, I just signed you up to an online French course. A present. [chuckles] We have about seven hours left together. Do we want to spend them like this? Absolutely not. In fact, quite the opposite. - My evening starts now. - [Marta giggling] [singing "Nessun dorma" in Italian] - [Marta squeals] - [plane engines zoom overhead] I have to go. I'm already late. Bye. - Hey. - [Gabriele] What's up? Are we okay? Sure. Why do you ask? [PA chimes] Then give me another half a second. Please. I'm sorry, but I'll miss my flight. - Okay. - [Gabriele] Bye. [Marta] Bye. [sombre piano music playing] One... two... [giggles] Come on. Come on. [panting] Twice. He only turned around twice. Okay, let's hear it. What does that mean in Marta land? - That there's something wrong! - Is it because of the distance? Maybe. But I think there's something else. Maybe he's just jealous of Tommaso. No. Gabriele should know by now he's gay. [mobile phone chimes] TOMMY SO SOUP ME NEW MESSAGE HI MARTA. WANNA GO OUT? Potentially gay? Well, now you have to go out with him and ask him directly. All right. But don't tell Gabriele, or we'll end up having a massive fight. You'll see. You'll get a man, and I'll end up losing mine. Sounds okay. [ambulance siren wailing outside] [Caponi] Come, Marta. Come in. No, no. You guys stay out here. [Marta exhales deeply] [Marta inhales deeply] [Marta exhales deeply] You can get dressed. From the chart, it looks like everything's beginning to stabilise. Have you had any problems? No, not so far. Not really. [chuckles] How marvellously funny. They say laughing lengthens life. But not in your case. [sombre music playing] On the contrary, all the carelessness you showed with your stunts has reduced it. And by a lot. So it's my job now to find you a donor that is compatible. And yours is to stay alive until I do. Is that a deal? Doctor, I... Close the door on your way out, would you? Yes. [moody piano music playing] FOLLOW TOMMASO: BEAUTIFUL! [Gabriele sighs] [Gabriele] Okay, I'll just try it once. No more. What if they did that to you? No, come on. You can't do this. Don't do anything stupid. [clicks tongue, sighs] Stop. Stop. Maybe it's not even the right password. [Gabriele typing] "GabriMarta2021." CHECK OUT THIS TUTORIAL FANCY A GAME? FIVE QUESTIONS EACH NO LYING. WILDCARD IF YOU DON'T WANNA ANSWER. I'LL ASK THE KEY QUESTION TONIGHT I haven't laughed so much in ages. Are you saying I'm a clown? - I am. - [Marta laughs] And in a world where everyone's snotty, it's the finest compliment anyone can get. Oh. Hmm. [chuckles] [patrons chattering indistinctly] What's up? Nothing. [takes a deep breath] I wanted to thank you. You know, for karaoke the other night and for coming out with me. It's just, I'm lonely, I think. Are you kidding? It was a pleasure. I mean, you are quite ugly, but luckily, you're very funny. - [Marta chuckles] - You too. [Marta sighs] Listen, about that question I wanted to ask you... It's a bit delicate, so I hope you won't take it too personally. Go for it. Uh, so, um... I would like to know... - No, not just me. - [mobile phone vibrating] We would all like to... I'm sorry. Can you give me a minute? - Sure. - Thank you. - I'll be right back. - [Tommaso] Mm-hmm. - Hey, monsieur. You finish working? - [Gabriele] No. Just having a break. So, here I am. All yours. Ah, it's a bit noisy. Where are you? Uh, I'm out having dinner. Who are you with? With Jacopo. [gentle piano music playing] No, you're not. What on earth do you mean? Of course I am. All right. Then, let me talk to him. Gabriele, what's going on? Marta, are you with Tommaso? Marta, answer me. Are you with Tommaso? Wait, I'll explain. This is to find out if Tommaso is interested in Jacopo. That's all. Jacopo? What? The guy you just told me was with you at the table a minute ago? Sorry, you're right. I shouldn't have lied. But there's nothing between me and Tommaso. So, this is why I've been asking you to come to Paris for weeks, but you've always found an excuse. The problem is not you. It's me. Because I am not Tommaso or Arturo, and it's pretty clear that I'm just not enough! Gabriele, for me, you are way more than enough. You know that's not true. Stop it! Stop it! And you know what the worst thing is? How you always follow the same pattern. You find someone out of your league, you stalk him, you play the questions game until he gives up. Gabriele, I'm sorry, but, um, how do you know about the question game? Gabriele, answer me. I logged onto your profile. And thank goodness I did. Otherwise, I wouldn't have found anything out! There was nothing to find out. But right now, it really doesn't matter if you believe me or not. You've made me feel dirty and wrong, when the only one in the wrong is you. Not only because you showed me that you don't trust me, but, above all, you've made me see that I can't trust you. No, Marta. Wait. I did it because I care about us. No. [sniffles] I think we both know why you did it. When I feel insecure, and I swear to you, it happens a lot, I don't calm myself down by rummaging in someone else's drawers. No, wait, Marta. Let me explain. I'm begging you. No. Now I'm gonna hang up and go finish crying. And don't try to contact me any more, because you'll be blocked. If you want to know something about me, keep reading my account. It'll be the only thing you have. Listen, Marta. Please... [dramatic orchestral music playing] [Jacopo] It's all my fault. No, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have trusted him. Are you absolutely sure you don't want to give him a second chance? People make mistakes. Of course they make mistakes. But this mistake can never be fixed. There will always be new skeletons. If he doesn't feel good enough, that's not my problem. [sniffles] [Marta breathing shakily] Just wondering. Did you ask Tommaso that question? I'm sorry. Okay. [Marta chuckles] [all laughing] [Marta chuckles, sighs] [birds singing outside] ["Nuits d'été" playing] MISSED CALLS: GABRIELE (25) RANG FOR 27 SECONDS [indistinct chatter] [Marta coughs] Okay. You can get dressed. EAT EVERYTHING [birds singing] BLOCK USER ARE YOU SURE? YES [treadmill beeps] [song fades] [knocking on door] Come in. Shut the door. - So... this... is for you. - What is it? It's an invitation to the cybersecurity summit this weekend. Usually, interns aren't invited. But in your case, I'd say you've earned it. [chuckles] Thank you. I... Well, uh... I thought... I got assigned a logistics task, like Silvia and Cristina. You know, I really wouldn't want to be around the guests while they're all busy working. Sweet Federica. Still trying to get on with those two witches. [man] Mau, can I borrow you for a moment? [quietly] That's why I told you to close the door. Coming. Talk to me. [man] These are the video-mapping test results. [Mauro] I'll take a look. Thank you. [tense music playing] - Here. - [man] Done. Thank you. - [door closes] - [Mauro] Where were we? Oh, um, I think we're done. Uh... Thanks for inviting me. I will definitely be there. Good. [Federica takes a deep breath] [Federica chuckles] You know what? I feel like I'm living in a film. [scoffs] Me too. It's Beauty and the Beast. [laughs sarcastically] I know you're just faking it, and... and you're actually even a bit fond of... Oh! [leaves rustle] Jacopo! Hey! Hi. What are you doing here? You're a bit far from home. Just going for a walk. On my own. Yeah, on your own. Come on. You can tell me. Who's the new fella? Is he a politician? An actor? [quietly] A priest? [gasps] Is he officially gay but secretly straight? - No boyfriend. That's marketing. - [mobile phone chimes] HEY, HANDSOME. MEET TONIGHT? JUST US TWO... Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [laughing wildly] - Yes! [continues laughing] - [Rebecca sighs] [Jacopo] Yes! [lively instrumental music playing] [Giacomo grunts] You okay? [indistinct chatter] - Okay. - Then you can put them here. Okay? Okay. Could you take over for ten minutes? [calming piano music playing] - [chuckles] Hi. - Ten minutes? I thought I was fast, but you certainly beat me. Listen, there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a while. I think I know what it is. Really? Yeah. No. But I could be wrong. Maybe. Jacopo, I'm going home the day after tomorrow. I've been here for a couple of months, and Turin can be a very cold city. I missed my friends, and so I pretended not to see what was happening, because... You liked the attention you were getting from us. I get it. You get it? Yeah, I get it. Maybe I would've done the same too. [sighs] I'm glad you told me. I hope I didn't cause any problems for Marta and Gabriele. [chuckling] No. Don't worry. Okay. - Bye. - See you, then. Wait a moment. - [romantic instrumental music playing] - [Tommaso gasps] Well, now we know the answer to that one. Have a good trip. [music continues] [Marta panting] So? How does he kiss? Nothing special. If you make him feel sorry for you, you'll get a kiss too. - [Marta laughs] - [mobile phone ringing] Hello? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yes? Of course. Thank you. Thank you. [tense music playing] What's going on? That was the hospital. My lungs are on their way. [chuckles] It's really important that I keep my phone with me because they could call any time now, day or night, and we have to be ready to go straight there. - Oh God. - Did they tell you when they'll call? It could be a matter of days. I have to pack, and I want to say goodbye to the others. This is it. [chuckles, panting] - [playing "Bye Bye"] - ♪ It's not about the things you do ♪ ♪ It's not about the things you say ♪ ♪ And I don't know why But it hurts my feelings again ♪ ♪ Bye, bye, ah ♪ ♪ Bye, bye ♪ ♪ It hurts, but it's for the best ♪ ♪ The best ♪ ♪ Bye, bye, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Bye, bye ♪ [in French] Everything all right? Yes. I'm fine. - Bye. - [busker] Bye. [busker continues playing] [guitar music fades] Part of me would really just like to unblock that freakin' number, call him, and tell him to come straight here. So why don't you, then? I only want to do it 'cause I'm scared. [gentle chime music playing] It's normal to be scared. I'm scared too. And it's also normal to want to hug someone. But I already have you two for that. [chuckles, sighs] [Marta chuckles softly] [all sigh] You were right, you know. It was too early. [sighs, chuckles] What a shitty day, huh? And to top it off, I've also got to go and ask for prolonged sick leave at work. I crashed and burned in the most spectacular way possible. And I deleted Drool. It's not for me. Today's the day I'm going to lose my job. [chuckles softly] But I'm bringing Mauro down with me. - [band playing] - [camera shutters clicking] [guests chattering indistinctly] - [Federica] Hey. - Oh, hi. - Everything all right? - Yes, yes. - Cristina? - There. I'm gonna look around. MEET ME BY THE LIFTS. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. [tense instrumental music playing] [upbeat music playing] [camera shutters clicking] [photographer] Hey! Miss, a picture? Miss! Over here! Come on. [photographer shouting indistinctly] Wow. How beautiful. A toast? [Federica] To what? To our new junior cybersecurity analyst. Really? I did tell you that I would win the bet. I really like the way you're working. And you have the potential to grow. Thanks, Mauro. Trust me. I won't let you down. - I'm sure you won't. - [ominous music playing] But you see, in order to think about what the company can do for you, first, you must think about... what you can do for the company. - What are you doing? - I'm kissing you. What makes you think that I would even want to be kissed? [music fades] [Mauro exhales] Look, now I'm really embarrassed. [sighs] I'm sorry. I must've misunderstood. I'm sorry. Shall we go back inside? - [dramatic music playing] - In my opinion, you're not sorry at all. - [Mauro] Excuse me? - I said, you're not sorry at all. And you systematically do this with all your female employees. And what do you do if they turn you down? A nice demotion? You bully them until they leave? Those are very serious accusations, you know? I know. So, maybe before speaking, you should have evidence to back it up. You made a big mistake and shouldn't have left me alone in your office. [whooshing] [man] These are the video-mapping test results. - [Mauro] I'll take a look. Thank you. - [man] No, Mauro. I need them urgently. So much interesting information in such a tiny thing, eh? You think? [Federica sighs] NO FILES FOUND [Mauro] Who do you think you're dealing with, little girl? Did you really think I wouldn't notice you'd spied on my phone? I even disabled the webcam and microphone, in case you decided to start recording our little conversation. You are all the same. Irene, Michela, Marinella... You're wonderfully ambitious. You want to get to the top, and you think it's free. See? You'll never be able to conquer this world alone. There will always have to be one of us choosing to give it to you. Always. [Federica] Wait, Mauro. You played your hand very badly. Tomorrow I want your resignation letter on my desk, cutie. - [Mauro talking on speakers] - [man 1] He's coming back. [Federica] Wait, Mauro. - [crowd murmuring] - [Mauro] You played your hand badly. Tomorrow I want your resignation letter on my desk, cutie. You deactivated my phone, not yours. As you hacked my phone to delete all the files I had stolen from you, you didn't notice the app that Cristina had installed on your phone to turn it into a microphone. Then, the closed-circuit cameras did the rest. Syncing audio and video was child's play. No, sorry... girls' play. - Boo. - [spluttering] Ah. Delfina, I... [Delfina] Yes, you. You've just made the biggest arse of yourself in history. You have underestimated your employees, Mauro. Still, you were the one who chose them. You should trust your decisions more. Delfina, these three madwomen's behaviour will cost the company millions. [quietly] Clients lost forever. Yes, you're right about that. Only today, we lost at least one million orders. But it's so satisfying to take out a pig like you, right here, on the global stage. Money well spent. Fuck yeah! [gentle music playing] - Which one of you is Silvia? - I am. [Cristina chuckles softly] I've read your personal file in the company staff management database. Law graduate, a master's in management engineering. If you want it, this bastard's job is yours. [Silvia gasps] As for you, I expect your resignation letter on my desk first thing tomorrow morning, sweetheart. - [man 1] He deserved it! - [man 2] Bravo! You let yourself get fucked again by four queens, eh? Excuse me. ["Karma" playing] [Federica exhales] [guests chattering excitedly] - Nothing from the hospital? - [Marta] Uh-uh. Guys! Victory! [group whoops] [glasses clink] - [Giacomo] Beer? - [Rebecca] Mm-hmm. Wait, I'll help you. No, I can do it myself. Thank you. Do you know Giacomo? We call him Gollum. [laughs] You know he's got himself a girlfriend? Here she is. - [Vittorio laughs] - [Giacomo laughs sarcastically] Yes. And this is my mistress. [Rebecca] Can you turn the music off, please? The music! - [song stops abruptly] - [Rebecca] Okay. [guests murmuring] [Rebecca takes a deep breath] When we sit and wonder what the meaning of life is, if everything is destined to end, the only answer that comes to mind is that we probably want to leave something behind. [gentle piano music playing] And to inspire, which is the only thing that makes us feel alive. Marta, for me, you are the greatest inspiration. You always smile. You are stubborn and you never give a damn about what others may think of you. I envy you for that. So tonight, to honour Marta, a new Rebecca is born. And, yes, it's true. I have a boyfriend. You must be wondering who he is, right? My boyfriend is a guy who's completely different from me. [Rebecca sighs] Has terrible dress sense. Who's extremely clumsy and will probably be bald by the time he's 30. But I wouldn't change him for the world. I love you, Giacomo. [Rebecca sighs] [Rebecca chuckles softly] ["Karma" resumes playing] HOSPITAL It's time. [song fades out] Cool, this new hospital. Why's the operation here? Well, The Shit works here. - Oh. [chuckles] - Do you need anything? Yes. A new pair of lungs, please. But they told me they're on their way. [chuckles] What about Gabriele? Call him. Whose side are you two on anyway? Yours. Always. He made a mistake. You're right. But whoever has to face such skeletons can become a little insecure, right? Okay. Then, let's make a deal. If I survive the operation, I'll think about it. Otherwise, if I die, I'd say the problem is solved. Come on. Stop kidding around. [Marta] You're right. It's not a laughing matter. [sombre orchestral music playing] The truth is, I'm shitting myself. I have always, always seen the glass half full. And every time reality hit, I'd push back at it with a great big laugh. [chuckles, whines] But I can't keep pretending any more. [sniffles] [sobbing softly] I'm scared. Everything will be fine. No! [sniffles] We don't know if everything will be fine. Please, I'm begging you, I really need your help to deal with this right now. How? Screaming, if I need to. At my parents, who gave me this damn disease and then went off and crashed their car, leaving me to cope on my own. And here I am, screaming, "Why me?" Why not someone else? I can't fucking do it any more. I'm so tired of fighting. [Marta sniffles] [knocking on door] Marta? Hi. Hello, Doctor. Tomorrow's an important day. [Marta sniffles] I want you to know the lungs you'll receive with the transplant are in perfect condition. [Marta] Mm. And the chances of rejection are really low. We'll start tomorrow at 8:30, okay? Thank you, Doctor. I'm the only one who can say everything will be great. Everything will be great. [Marta chuckles] [wolf-whistle alert sounds] Are you back on Drool? Me? No. Ah, that's where I left it. See you tomorrow. [sombre music playing] [Marta laughs] - [group laughing] - I told you it wasn't me. HOSPITAL Hi. Yes, listen. Tomorrow morning at 8:30. All confirmed. Okay, bye. See you tomorrow. What do you think you're doing? Look, for the first time, I'm not listening to Marta. It's fine, right? [suspenseful instrumental music playing] [music building] [indistinct chatter] [woman 1, in French] Another general strike. [man 1] Unbelievable. Always the same! - [man 2] Hello? - [woman 2] We'll rent a car. [woman 3, in English] What are we going to do now? - [woman 4] We've been waiting! - I need to go now. I need to go to London! [announcer on PA, in French] Attention. Due to a general strike, all flights from Paris Charles de Gaulle have been cancelled. For more information or to rearrange your flight... - [gentle music playing] - [in English] It's Gabriele. [sighs] Fuck. Air traffic strike. He's gonna try and rent a car. [indistinct chatter] [woman speaking French over PA] - [in French] Thank you, madam. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good evening. I'm sorry. We have no more cars available. Try to find a solution, please. I'm sorry, sir. - [sombre piano music playing] - [Gabriele sighs] Sir, wait! I've found a car. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. [woman typing] [mobile phone chimes] He's on his way. He's coming. The GPS says 7 hours and 45 minutes. - He'll make it just in time. - Let's hope so. [Jacopo exhales] [Gabriele sighs heavily] [Marta sighs] [Marta exhales] [stirring orchestral music playing] [line ringing] [mobile phone ringing] - [electricity crackles] - [Gabriele] No! [call disconnects] Fuck it! [Federica] Hey. - How are you feeling? - [weakly] I really can't wait. [operator on recording] Recorded message. The number you're trying to call is not... [mournful vocal playing] TURIN [Gabriele taps dashboard] [Federica] Here. What's wrong with you two? [both] Nothing. Guys, could you move out of the way, please? - [Jacopo] Yeah. - Yes. [Marta] Mm. [nurse] You can lie down. - Yeah. - Gently. - [sighs] See you. - [nurse] Excuse me. [brakes screech] [ambulance siren blaring] Where the hell is Gabriele? Oh shit. [mournful music swells] [speaking inaudibly] What different hospital?
