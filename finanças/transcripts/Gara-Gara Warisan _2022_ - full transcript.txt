STARVISION PRESENTS Adam, wait. You're forgetting something. Nothing, Mom. I got everything. You're young, but forgetful. Here. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I can't be late. You know my coach is so mean. He's not mean. He wants you to be disciplined. Or else, how do you expect to be qualified for the final? Right? Okay. It's useless for me to reach the final. You won't come to watch anyway. I really want to. But you know I have to take care of your little brother. What if he relapses? Alright? Hey. Smile, Dear. Smile. That's better. Alright. Alright, I'm leaving. Take care, do your best. Dear, look. He wants to come along. Oh you. Alright, stay with Mom. Fine. Good boy. -Don't forget his medicine. -Yes. If he has trouble breathing, contact me right away. I will. -Say bye to Daddy. -Bye. Laras, look after your brother. WRITER AND DIRECTOR MUHADKLY ACHO PRODUCERS CHAND PARWEZ SERVIA -ERNEST PRAKASA Here's the martabak. -Alright! -Calm down. This one's for you. Where's the chocolate-cheese one, Dad? Just eat that one. Your brother doesn't like chocolate. Right? -Yes. -Just a minute. What are you eating? Martabak. Yummy! Chocolate and cheese martabak. It's done. Try it. Good? I can finish all this. -That's amazing. -I'm hungry. Here are your lupis, Mrs. Salma. Here you go. Do you want this? It's delicious. You said you're hungry. Looks like she's more hungry than me. This kind of thing is useless. It will only distract you from school, Adam. Dear, how about we let him try? They're still selecting players. You can manage your schedule, right? That's the thing, Dear. We must stop him while they're still selecting. What if he gets accepted to the national team? It will be troublesome. That's enough, Adam. Just study well. Chase your dream. This is my dream, Dad. Soccer is a hobby, not a dream. A dream is to work in a huge company or a bank. That's what I call a dream. I'll go to the guest house. Yes, Dear. WE INVITE ADAM PUTRA LESMANA TO ATTEND THE U-13 NATIONAL TEAM FIRST SELECTION. Happy birthday, Mom. Dicky's performance is extraordinary, Dear. His guitar lessons is worth it. You should form a band. Relax, Dad. Happy birthday, Mom. Don't forget your medicine. Alright? I'll hire a nurseto take care of your mom. She can clean her, prepare her meal. Just about everything. So you can focus on your college. No. I want to take care of Mom. I'll go back to college after she recovers. Laras, you know that your mom... Mom will get better, Dad. Mom... What's the matter, Child? Nothing. You idiot. Make a note,maximize Mr. Adit's credit limit. Raise it to the max, okay? Because he's our loyal customer. Adam. What happened? I squeezed it too hard, Ma'am. Hello, good day. Cendana Bank here. I'm Adam. How can I help you? Stupid bank! I can't transfer moneysince last night. What is this? Yes, we apologize. Who am I speaking to right now? You're so curious. Alright, we apologize. May I ask again, who am I speaking to right now? Mulyo, Mr. Mulyo. Alright, Mr. Mulyo. First, I will match your data, Sir. Can you tell me your mother's maiden name? Hey, bringing up my mother?And you call her a maiden? Who do you think gave birth to me?! Alright, then... ...can you tell me your date of birth? Why are you asking about my birthday? You want to give me a surprise? Alright, then can you tell me your domicile address, Sir? Oh, you want to come and see me?Go ahead! When will you come? I'll wait for you!You think I'm afraid? You jerk! Let's rotate our neck, hands on your waist. Let's rotate to the left. One... Two... Keep it slow, your heads might fall. Okay. Now, hands on your chin. Your own chin, Mr. Samsul. Not on Ms. Yayuk's. She's adorable. Alright, come on. Why don't you join the exercise, Ma'am? No. Benny's not fun as an exercise instructor. He won't play dangdut music. This exercise is for our joints, Ma'am. With dangdut music, it would be an aerobic exercise. It's fine. So I can be slim like you. You're pretty the way you are. Beautiful, like Kendall Jenner. You're too much. Who's that anyway? A celebrity. I've never heard of her. What's her last TV series? What do you mean "TV series"? She's a foreign celebrity. -I need to take a shower. -Yes. -Two, three, four... -You just stay and watch Benny. -Five, six, seven... -He's exercising. Eight. Alright, let's take a break. Let's take a break. Laras... Earlier, Mr. Anton called. He wants to meet us. Let's talk about this later, find a solution. -Alright? -Okay. Grandma Surti. "Kendal". Call me "Grandma Kendal". Kendal? Ras, who's Kendal? -Hello, Dad? -Dicky. I transferred you the money. Right. Thank you, Dad. Don't use it for... No, Dad. I told you, I'm clean now. Right, that's my boy. Dicky, won't you come home for now? When you get a gig, you can go back to your boarding house. Gosh Dad, that's a hassle. Dad, I need to hang up. I'm in a hurry. Dicky... Dear. Your medicine. Morning medicine. You don't have to go to the guest house today. Just stay home. The doctor said you shouldn't work too hard. Astuti, I don't lift barbells at the guest house. And the employees will have a hard time if I don't come. Come back if you're tired. Yes, Mrs. Astuti. -What's happening here?-He's a towel thief, Sir. Are you a thief? No, Sir. I've told them, it accidentally got stuck there. What do mean? Is this hanger and that ashtray got stuck too? Check again, Win. What's this? You're taking the handset? Where's the phone?! Hey, this is theft. We can report you to the police. Report him, Sir. Call the Mobile Brigade Corps too. You're toast. They'll make you do 200 push-ups. Right, Win? Shut up! Please don't, Sir. I'm sorry, I was wrong. I took them for souvenirs, Sir. What are you saying? Look. You even took the shower head? Are you trying to open a building material store? Oh that, the shower head at my house is loose. Loose? What, your baby tooth? Alright, return these items. Reattach that! -Wait, Sir. -Now what? -Face that way. -That way? Turn around! Goodness. -What's this? -My spine, Bro. Spine at your waist? You think I didn't graduate elementary school? Dear Allah, have mercy, Sir. He took the toilet seat. That's enough. Hey, this is your last warning. Don't you ever... -What's this? -My bone, Sir. You're all bones! I'm shocked. Goodness, the AC remote. What's wrong with your life?! Please come in, Sir. -Please, Sir. -Ma'am. -Excuse us. -Yes. Please come in, Ma'am. -Sir. -Yes? If you need us for anything... ...just press 0 on the phone. We'll come right away. -Right. Thank you. -Yes. He doesn't understand, Aceng. His brain is soft. Aceng, you try it. -Sir. -Yes? Don't forget. If you need anything... -...just dial 0. -Yes. -I will. Thank you. -Okay. Sir. Let me remind you one more time. If you need anything... ...you'll find the 0 button on the phone. If it doesn't work, press it a little harder. Alright? Just reminding. Sir, please don't make this a habit. It's not nice if other employees see this. Thank you. Aceng, I'll take 30.000. My hand hurts Dear, let's order some drink. Why's the handset gone? But it has the 0 button, right? It's here. Hello? I am speechless. This spicy seblak is the winner. What shocks me even more is... The level of spiciness, it's really... Kevin... Kevin, hold the flashlight properly. My face will look murky if I don't get proper lighting. My hands are tired holding these for a long time. Just hold on a little longer. My face needs to look bright. How bright do you need to be? Like an angel? Just hold on a little longer, Dear. If I keep repeating this, my lips will become swollen. Wouldn't you be embarrassed? If I go out... ...your friends might say, "Look at Kevin's mom, her lips are swollen." Well, don't go out if your lips are swollen. Package delivery. For Mrs. Rini? That's right. May I take a picture? -A picture? -Yes. The package, Ma'am. Excuse me, Ma'am. Yes. Oh, right. Let's do it again. Just a minute. -Okay. Thank you, Ma'am. -Yes. I'm home. Hi, Vin. What did you buy? A ring light. -What's a ring light? -It's a lamp. I need it to make videos when I receive endorsements. Then I don't have to hold the flashlight anymore. You'll have to hold this ring light. We have enough light here, Rin. They're far. I need one close to my face. -How much is it? -I got a discount for this. It was 155.000, you know? So how much after the discount? I bought it for 150.000. -How much? -150.000. It's so hard to open. What's wrong with you? I don't know. My stomach is burning. I was reviewing some spicy seblak. Mom got a seblak endorsement? No, Mom bought it herself. Isn't there another way, Sir? Laras, it's hard for me too to close the foundation. But business is slow. I have to cut off all cost that are not priorities. Those senior citizens are our priority, Sir. They have no one. Yes, but I too have other priorities, Ras. You have to understand that. Excuse me, Mr. Anton. I know the situation is hard for you too. But do we really have to close the foundation, Sir? If I don't close the foundation... ...that means I have the responsibility to provide operational fund. How am I suppose to find it? I'll get the fund, Sir. Just don't close the foundation. You're so diligent. Of course. See, you slipped. You should slow down. This is a bad habit, Ijul. Squeeze your mop. True, the floor's all wet. What if Mr. Dahlan slip and fall? Fine, I'll fan it. It's easy. You're insane. People who fall should be helped, not fanned. He's a person, not a satay. I will fan the floor. Not Mr. Dahlan. The floor, Umar! -Yelling at me? -The floor! Are you mad? Don't laugh. Take that, a kuyang ghost sucked your head. Soon you'll have a fever. -I'll go home now. -Yes, Sir. Take care. -Goodness, Sir! -What's wrong, Sir? At the moment, the cirrhosis has developed into cancer. Our only option is a liver transplant. What's the cost estimation, Doc? It is quite expensive, Mr. Dahlan. Because the treatment will take a long time. And the medication will continue after the surgery. The cost might be around... Two or three billion. Aside from that, we must immediatelyfind a suitable liver donor. Maybe a family member. As long as the personhas the same blood type. Hello, Adam? I need to talk to you about something. Sick? What illness? Dad only asked me, Laras and Dicky to return home to Lembang. He needs to say something. Let's hope Dad's fine. Dam, have you read that brochure I gave you? I'll look into it later. It's a great school. My friends enrolled their kids there. Their English lesson is excellent. But schools like that are expensive, right? That's the thing. Try ask your dad for a help. While you visit him. As if you don't know how my dad is. If Dad pays for Kevin's tuition... ...he will try to control us. Then what's your plan? How about we enroll Kevin in a public school? Gosh. No, Adam. I once read on Google.. ...that school environment could determine a child's character. You know Mrs. Yuyun's boy? He's a student at 05 Afternoon Elementary School. I once saw her scolding her boy. But that boy yelled back at her, "Berengsek lo! (You witch!)" Gosh, don't let that happen to us. Can you guarantee that Kevin won't end up like that if we put him into a private school? Well, at least he could yell back in English. "I don't like you." "Hey you, whatever." DAD Laras! Ras! You don't have to do this. What are you doing? Why did you have to bring that woman home? No one can replace Mom, Dad! No matter how long, I will never replace your late mother, Laras. Then why did you have to get married again? Huh? Why?! Ras... Laras. RAS, DAD IS SICK. HE WANTS US TO RETURN HOME THIS SATURDAY. IT'S IMPORTANT. -Okay. -The helmet. Let me put it on you. Easy... Is it okay for me to come and visit your dad? It's fine. What if your siblings come? They won't come. Dad only called me. -Really? -Yes. -Really? -Really. There. Okay, let's go. What was your name again? Oh, Vega, Bro. Where did you first met Dicky? Gosh, what is this? We just got here and you're asking about stuff. I just want to ask, where did you two first meet? She's a friend. -Your user friend? -Huh? Use what? You think I'm stupid? -I know, you're the smart one. -Little Dicky. -Dad? -Hey. Everybody's gathering. Dad, what happened to you? Oh, it's the usual. I got exhausted. But why are you on Mom's wheelchair? So I don't get tired. You're not paralyzed, right? Watch your mouth! You want to race me? Here. -Dad! -Stop acting tough, will you? Oh, this... I just got out of bed, so I'm a bit shaky. Dad, let me introduce you to Vega. Hello. Come, let's eat. Take it slow. Bro, switch place. Ah, come. -Yes. -Here. Afternoon, Sir. Planning to stay? No, I'm just looking around. -Not staying? -No. Okay, move on. Keep going. The doctor suggested me... ...to retire. He said so I could rest more. That's why I gathered you all here. To discuss about the future of our guest house. And this is our family's internal matter. Can you wait for a while? Yeah, I'll wait. He means wait outside. Oh, outside. Is it alright, Ms. Vega? All good, Sir. So as you might have known... -What? -Where's my cellphone? My phone? Is it with you? -In the bag. -Oh, the bag. -In the bag. -Okay. So as you might have known... ...the guest house will be inherited to you all. But not now. Now, for the time being, all I want is... ...for one of you to help me manage the guest house. Anyone willing? Dear, it's better if we sell the guest house. So eager to sell stuff. -It's useless... -Look. Anyone willing to help me manage the guest house... ...will receive 70% of the profit. -I'll do it. -Let me do it, Dad. I can do it. Everybody's willing. -It's not here. -But how? -My phone's not here. -It's not there? I saw it. I looked everywhere, it's not here. It's here, my phone is here. It's ringing. But there's a condition. A condition? What is it? So Dad wants me, Laras and Dicky to stay for a month in Lembang. So the three of us can take turns managing the guest house everyday. It's a selection process. At the end of the month... ...one of us will be elected. Hmm, obviously he will choose Dicky. Seems like your dad loves you very much. He even calls you Little Dicky. How adorable. Yes, but the problem is, it won't be Dad's decision. The employees will elect one of us. With a vote. Now, a vote is a good thing. Dicky won't get elected. We still have Laras. What's with me? Well, I'm sure you'll get elected. You can manage a retirement home, a guest house would be easy. Forget a guest house. You can manage a zoo. You could stare at a raging lion, it will turn into a tapir with its head down. -What? -There's no guarantee to that. Managing a retirement home is not the same as managing a guest house. And how could Laras stand living together with Mrs. Tuti? Adam, this is your huge opportunity. If you get elected, we can put Kevin in any school we want. And Dad won't be able to control us, it would be your earnings. Besides, do you still enjoy... ...working as a call center staff? You can't do that.Give it back, it's mine! No! You jerk! Kevin, no. Stop. Imron! Let him go! Mrs. Yuyun! Goodness! Imron, let him go! You! Excuse him, Sir, Ma'am. -This kid... -"Berengsek lo!" Hey, goodness! Want me to lock you up? -Come on. -Get inside. So for one month... ...you'll be leaving me? I mean, leaving the retirement home. Leaving... Leaving everyone here? Ben, I'm sorry for troubling you. It's alright. This place will be fine. It's just that I won't be seeing you for a long time. -Ben, about us... -No, I... I don't wanna push you, okay? I'm just... I just wanna say that I'll miss you. That's it. Can I miss you? No? Fine, it's okay. You can. I'm embarrassed. Do that again. But honestly, I'm still a bit surprised. You volunteered to manage the guest house. If Adam or Laras manages the guest house... It'll be hard for me to ask for stuff. -Dick. -Hmm? Don't you wanna quit? It's tiring, living like this. Well, I do. But you know it's not easy. I... I sometimes imagine. Both of us, clean. And... Living our lives like other people. What do you mean like other people? Well, to have a purpose. A steady job. Maybe get married. Okay, just a second. -Ouch, what? -Just a second. Wait. You plan to marry me, right? Well, who else? Of course I'm gonna marry you. -What are you saying? -Is that so? Who else would want me? An addict, unemployed, dirty... -Wait. -What? Why are you insulting my taste? Of course, your taste is trashy. Your taste is trashier. Have mercy. Enough. I know it's not easy. And maybe we will fail many times. But you will try, right? Give me time, okay? Right, it's salty enough. Ms. Nina and Ms. Ida's blood pressure were high again. -Right, Miss. -Thank you. Would you like to buy some fish? No, we're saving money. Gosh, what else should we decrease to save money? Decrease the residents? How should we do that? Send them away? Would you do that? -Ben. -Well, I wouldn't do that either. You think I'm insane? We can't send those old people away. I feel sorry for them. So cruel. What I'm saying is... Let's relocate some of them to government-funded retirement homes. You've seen the condition there. They won't take care of the residents properly. I don't want that. Then what should we do? You've heard it yourself. Mr. Anton will no longer support our budget. Where should we find the money? Fine, for the time being, let's press our expenses. While we find another benefactor. What if we can't find one? Well, pray for me so I could be the benefactor. Right? Simple. "Pray for me so I could be the benefactor." Hardheaded. Unlike your head, soft. Excuse me, package delivery. Sign here, please. -Thank you, Ma'am. -You're welcome. What did you buy this time? A dress, for endorsements. So it's free. -I bought it. -But you said it's for endorsements. It's just a lure. Other brands will see me. "Hey, she gets a lot of endorsements." Like that. So what if you don't get the endorsements? Well, at least I get a new dress. Come on. Besides, it's cheap. I can pay in ten installments. And I got a cash-back. Really? How much? 8.700. It's not bad. 10.000 is the maximum. Adam, have you asked Ms. Sisil for your office leave? She might not allow it. Try it first, Dam. Why do you keep feeling nauseous? I don't know, maybe I'm pregnant. Hooray, I'll have a sibling. No, it can't be. I always dump outside. What do you always dump outside, Dad? The garbage. -The garbage? -This school is amazing. The facilities include swings. Why are you daydreaming without me? You want to daydream with me? -Yes. -Alright. Back then, whenever my children had no money... ...they daydreamed exactly just like you. I... I was just praying for this home. I pray that it can continue to give comfort for everyone. Your prayer is already answered. This place is not comfortable because of the blankets. And not because of the food. But because of you and Benny. Thank you, Ma'am. You ask for a month leave, Adam? What's that, a maternity leave? I understand, Ma'am. But it's urgent. You know it well, Adam. Even permanent employees don't get a month office leave. Let alone outsource employees like you. DAM, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!! If you ask for a month leave... ...it's the same as resigning. I guess I have to resign. Excuse me. Huh? He's resigning? -Hi, Mom. -Grandpa! My grandson is a big boy now. Of course. I'll have a sibling soon. Are you pregnant, Rin? I guess so. Even though Dad said he always dump outside. The garbage. Right, Dad? Such a talkative kid. You seem sleepy, you're talking gibberish. -I'm not sleepy, Mom. -Yes, you are. You're so sleepy. See, you're yawning. So sleepy. Kids nowadays are cute. Good morning, Wiwin. Now, here are our employees. Hello, I'm Umar. 22 years old, single. My hobby is to raise catfishes. Thank you. That's Umar, and this is Wiwin. Umar registers the check outs and check ins. While Ijul and Aceng here are in the housekeeping division. But when it's busy, Umar sometimes help. Right? That's right, Sir. I'm always eager to help. Frontside, backside. I'm flexible, Sir. Remember, your vote will decide your future. Mr. Dicky. I will choose you. So this is an election, Sir? Why an election? To elect Mr. Dahlan's employees. So, usually before an election... How should I say this? Handing out envelopes? -Do you have them, Sir? -Of course I do. He has prepared them. For termination letters. Want one? What a coincidence, Sir. He's been planning to get fired. -No. Says who? -You just said it. Just say that you want to get fired. Nobody said that, Sir. No. What do you think his illness is? When you're in a wheelchair like that, it's usually a stroke. No. People who had strokes have crooked lips. That's cleft lips, that's different. They are different things. But people who had strokes usually have crooked lips. Now, people with cleft lips, they're somewhat... Why are we discussing cleft lips? We were discussing illnesses that require a wheelchair. Why would a cleft lipped person need a wheelchair? How should I know? Ask Mr. Dahlan. Hey, you're insulting Mr. Dahlan's lips. Huh? Who said that? -You said that. -I didn't call him cleft lipped. -Right, Ceng? Me? -Yes. I'll tell Mr. Dahlan. -Sir! -Win, I just performed ablution. I can't insult people. Hey, I recorded everything here. Huh? Mar, what did you record? You called him cleft lipped. -I didn't say such thing, no. -You did. The evidence is here. -Why did you record me? -Mr. Dahlan! Where's your brother? He just finished showering. -Laras? -She said she's not hungry. Adam, just take the wings. Let your brother have the legs. There's still another leg, Dear. It's fine, save them for Dicky. Dad. Sis. Hey, we saved the legs for you. Mom, what are we doing here? Is our house for sale? If we could sell it, we would've done it earlier. We're just renting the house. What does "renting" mean, Mom? Renting means we pay a person to borrow us a house. Huh? We only borrow, but we have to pay? Weird person. Just go chat the person. FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION OF INDONESIA What's that, Dam? No. It's nothing. Excuse me. Howdy. Can I help you, Sir? I've been waiting for a long time. And my room's still not ready. What's wrong? Your room... -Morning, Sir. -Morning. -This is your boss? -Yes. Sir, excuse me. I don't want to complain. But I've been waiting for a long time, and my room's still not ready. What's wrong? Why's the room not ready, Umar? Ijul is still cleaning it, Sir. Still being cleaned. Ijul is still cleaning it, Sir. I mean, our staff is still cleaning it. You can't do that! When a guest arrives, the room must be ready. -Right? -Right. Right. He's right, Mar. -But... -What happened, Mar? He arrived too early, Sir. -He's too early? -Yes. It's still 12 PM. Sir, did you come too early? What do you mean too early? When I made the reservation, you told me to check in at 2 PM. -Right? -Right. What time is it? -Look at what time it is! -It's 2 PM, Sir. -It's even past 2 PM. -2 PM. It's 2 PM, Mar. Why is it 2 PM on his watch? Well, it's his watch. It's still 12 PM here. Excuse me, where are you from? I'm from Taliabu. -Where's Taliabu? -Probably near Ciwidey. Is Taliabu near Ciwidey, Sir? -North Maluku! -North Maluku, Mar. -My mistake. -Right. I think North Maluku is in the Eastern Indonesia time zone. We're in the Western time zone. That's what makes us different. Hey! Different? You call me different? Just because I'm from the East, you call me different? This is discrimination! Dear, this guys are racists! -No, Sir. -Let me tell you. Whether it's Western, Central or Eastern, we are the Republic of Indonesia! We are one! Do not differentiate us. We're not differentiating The rule says... What rule? Trying to control the Republic of Indonesia? -We're not... -No, I can't let this! It's just a matter of clock, Sir. Don't you dare say "just"! This is a matter of nationalism! I need to make this go viral. Let the people decide. Dear, go inside. -Mar, you handle this. -We'll make it viral, tell the society. -That this place discriminates people! -Make it viral, Dear. -Where's your logo? -Make it viral, Dear. Here, what is this place? Here it is, Salam Guest House! Salma, Sir. Don't correct him, Mar. Right, Salam. Salam? Salma or Salam? -Salma or Salam? -Salam. Seriously? Don't you have anyin the medicine cabinet? We don't have any, Ras. Last time we got the prescription filled was last month. Let me buy come Chinese herbal medicines. Don't, Ben. We have the prescription from the doctor. Well, I'm just offering. Let's do it this way. You go get the prescription filled, just half of it. Oh, I know. Let's try De Li Xiang, it's good for high blood pressure. -No. -What about Chen Yap Yang? No, Ben. Fine, I'll get the prescription filled. Alright. I should've offered her Lao Xin Tong. Why were you panicked? You've been a call center staff for years, you're used to being yelled at. Well, being yelled at by phone is different compared to being yelled at in person. But still. You have to take a stand. You're the boss. I'm afraid to make mistakes. Adam, if they don't see you as a leader... ...they won't choose you. Just go for it. If you make mistakes, just apologize. I often do nothing wrong. But Mom always ask me to apologize. You stay out of this. Have you guys had your lunch? We had, Sir. Any more reservation today? We have one guest, Sir. He'll arrive soon. Okay. Starting from today... ...I want to improve our service. -Like what, Sir? -Starting with how we greet the guests. How we handle complaints, anything. No matter what, think of a guest as a king. Wow, that's great, Sir. Umar's dream is to become a concubine. Now, prepare a welcome drink. -Huh? -We serve a drink to welcome a guest. Just prepare some. Tea, anything simple. We give drinks to our guest? -Give them drinks. -Okay. -Give drinks to guests. -Prepare some. Excuse me. May I ask where Salma Guest House is? Huh? Look over there. Oh, sorry. I thought it's over here. Alright. -Now make a line behind me, smile. -Excuse me. Good day, Sir. Welcome to Salma Guest House. Can I help you with anything? -I... -Ah, here you go. Have a drink. This is a welcome drink. Welcome drink, welcome tonight. Drink a lot, you have wrinkles. Enjoy the drink. Sir, let me help you with your bag. How kind. -Hey! -He fell. It's so heavy. What are you carrying? The Farmer's Monument? I'm sorry. -Ijul. -Come on. -So heavy. -Can you do it? Ijul, my hand. Hold that side. This way. That's it. Dicky, wake up. Dicky, come on, wake up. Dear. Dicky won't wake up. It's good if he sleeps. That means he's not on meth. Who's that, Dear? Dicky. What was his illness? He has a heart defect since birth. All because of me. All because of me. What do you mean? When he was still in the womb... ...I smoked heavily. I kept on smoking. Even though Salma often warned me. I was a fool. I kept on smoking. Salma ended up inhaling too much second hand smoke. And it affected the pregnancy. "Salma Guest House, good evening. I'm Wiwin. Can I help you?" See? It's different. The important thing is, to make sure we sound sincere... ...before we pick up the phone, just prepare a smile. Let me see your smile. Wiwin is holding her poop. -This his how I smile! -Alright, alright. -Umar. -Yes. Huh, is your tonsil swollen? Alright, alright. Okay, now it's your turn, Mar. -Me, Sir? -Yes, pick up the phone. Remember. Smile first, and talk. -Hello? -Yes, Dear? Oops. Sorry, Sir. I got carried away. May I do it again? Hello? Hello, Salma Guest House. Good evening. Umar is ready to serve until you're satisfied. Friendly, Umar. Not slutty. Come here. Where are you going? Vin, I need you to keep a lookout. If Grandpa comes in, let me know. Hold this. Are you sleepy? Dad... No, this is for Kevin's school assignment. My school hasn't started yet. When your school starts, you'll have a lot of assignments like this. That's why we have to practice, okay? Dad. Why didn't you tell me that Grandpa's here? Tastes fresh, Win. The chili sauce is so hot! This isn't chili, this is cobra venom. Maybe they mixed it with hot ointment. What's with you? My bottom end is burning, Aceng. You ate too much chili sauce. I can't stand it anymore. Sorry, I have to go. -Share some. -Hey! Fool, why did you waste it? -Sorry, I can't stand it... -Guys. Let's have a meeting inside. Huh? Inside? -Yes, now. -Now? It's coming out. I can't stand it anymore! Put a rock in your pocket. Find a rock. -What do I need a rock for? -To hold it in. So huge, you wanna build an Islamic school? So he can hold it in longer. I'll smack your head with that stone. Put that away. Come on. Don't move! I'll stab you! I need to cough, it's too spicy. Don't cough. Don't! So how do people book our rooms? By phone, Miss. So we hand out drinks... Oops, not drinks. We hand out brochures. At the airport and travel agents. -Do you get a lot of reservations? -On weekends, it's usually crowded, Miss. But on weekdays, sometimes it's spicy. Why did I say spicy? I mean vacant. If we can apply our guest house to an online booking application... ...we can get more guests. How do we do that, Miss? We have to register it. To the village administration office? Oh you. That's a sub-district's office matter. Right, Miss? No, to the service provider. I'll handle the registration. Are we done, Miss? Wait. Huh? We still have to wait? What did Adam do yesterday? Oh that, Miss. He taught us how to greet guests, 5-stars hotel style. With welcome drinks and everything. Insane, it gave me goosebumps. I'm having goosebumps too. Not just you, right? But those things are normal. Nothing interesting, right? A special program needs to create a huge breakthrough. Like my idea, right? Yes, but I think... Aceng thinks we're done. Yes. Right, Ceng? I think we're done. Salma Guest House, good evening. I'm Wiwin. Can I help you? The water is still not hot, Miss. Please move me to another room. Moved to another room, Sir? Please wait, I'll ask my superior first. Miss, please help me out. What's wrong? That guest from earlier, he said the water's still not hot. He wants another room. Hello, Sir. I apologize, but we can't move you to another room. Besides, the water is the same in all rooms. The brochure says "hot shower". But it's not hot. It's false advertising. I can sue this guest house. I don't care how. I want a hot shower. Still not hot enough, Sir? Miss, I think it's not hot enough. Let me just bring the gas tank here. Uh, no need, Sir. It's hot enough. Boiling, even. Have a nice shower, Sir. Sir, when your skin peels off, please let us know. We'll bring you some duct tape. Have a nice shower, Sir. Gosh. So serious, making something like that. This guest house's system is a mess. I need to sort out a lot of things. Well... You wouldn't stand living here, Ras. It's useless. But I need the fund for the retirement home. My benefactor pulled back. She said that? Well, just relax. When she gets a new benefactor, I'm sure Laras will return to the retirement home. What if she doesn't get a benefactor? And I don't get elected, what should we do? Adam, you're such a pessimist. I'm not being a pessimist, you didn't see her work plan. It has graphs, up and down, with different colors. Gosh, looking at it drives me nuts. Alright, don't think about it. I read it on Google. Pessimism could increase the risk of health problems and stress. It's on Google? Where is it? It's there. The point is... Look at my effort in the beginning to become an influencer. I was willing to spend money to buy stuff. I take pictures, post them, review them. Now you see me? You're an influencer now? Well, no. I only ask you to see my effort. What's with you? Stay focused, please. Package delivery. I think that's for me. She had it delivered to Lembang. Hey. Don't stare like that. Do you want it so bad, Bro? How can you stand it? Just so you know, I've been holding back. It gives me suggestions. Let me feed you. Oh, he's prepared. He's prepared. Do you remember Ruben? Yeah, why? So... He said he's having a soft launch for his cafe. Next week in Jakarta. He asked us to perform. What do you say? Why do you look so unenthusiastic? Tomorrow's my turn to manage the guest house. But I still don't know what program to make. Gosh, just relax. I mean, just go along with the existing system. But if I just play it safe, how will the employees elect me? You should focus on pleasing the employees. What do you mean? Well, if you bring happiness and joy to them... ...surely they will choose you. Happiness? Joy? I think I can do that. I can make you happy, let alone those employees. Umar. Are the guests in Room 12 checking out or not? They are. Good day, Mr. Dicky. Oh, good day. -Sir. -Yes. How is it, Sir? Any program for our guest house? -Huh? -Huh? -Program? -Yes. Maybe you have some kind of a strategy? He's confused. He's confused. I have none. His brain is empty. Let's do it like the usual. As long as we're happy. No, this is not him. Do you guys like... You guys like to eat? Of course we like to eat. Of course we like to eat. We're people. Even animals eat. You do? We do. Alright, it's lunch time soon. You should go eat out. My treat. Wow. What have I told you since the beginning? This is my chief and future leader that I've been looking for. Mr. Dicky, are you coming along? Yes. Then who will watch this place? Oh right. Who? Oh, let me do it. I'll look after it. My chief. This is the kind of leader I will choose. We salute our chief. Two hands salute for our chief. You too. Alright. Brings us closer, no distance between us, right? You can lower your hands, Chief. -Oh right. -Yeah. We're going out to lunch. Alright. Here you go, Sir. Hey, you forgot something. Where's the soy sauce? This fool. Eating "pija" with soy sauce. you think it's tempe fritter? You hillbilly! You countryside girl! "Pija"? It's "Fitza". Shut up. I don't care if it's "pija", "fitza" or... Whatever. Help me figure out how to drink this. The straw is unusual. It has no hole. It's flat. It won't come out. No wonder you can't suck it. It's a spoon. See, you use it like this. See? Rich people drink lightly like this. -Are you sure it's a spoon? -Yes, look. -You sure? -Yes, look. Are they rich people or guinea pigs? -Hello? -Help! I got locked in the bathroom, Sir! Just a moment, Sir. Which room are you in, Sir? I didn't count it, I immediately took a dump. Nobody asks you to count, Sir. I mean, there's a number on your door. What's the number? I don't know, Sir. Don't press me, I'm under enough pressure here! -Okay, Sir. -Just come here! -Right, just a moment. -Call my name, Sony. Hurry! Mr. Sony? Mr. Sony? Sir? I'm here, Sir. Can you hear me? Don't panic, Sir. Just a moment. I'm here, Sir! Yes, Mr. Sony. Can you hear me? I can hear you, Sir. I can smell you too. Okay then... Thank you, Sir! Alright, Sir. Alright? Calm down, Mr. Sony. Mr. Sony... Look, Sir. If you want to lock the door, just push it a little. And push the button. To open it, just turn the knob. Help! Calm down, Sir. This is just a... Help! So it's included in the application? Chief, I think my bowl's almost empty. Just finish it first. You glutton. -Sir, another portion. -Another one for me, Sir. Our guest house is now registered in an online booking application. So now people can book... I want to stay here. -Girl, Uncle have something for you. -This mister is kind. -Here you go. -Look. He has some orange candies. No, I want the melon flavor. Sir, please look for some. We have none, Sir. Or tell you what, let's make it simple, if you don't have any melon candy. How about the actual melon fruit? Okay. Aceng. Do we have a melon? An actual melon. A melon? -We have one, do we? -We do. Just a moment, Sir, little girl. This place is nice. Kids love to stay here. Sir. Little girl, we got you a melon. It's big and nice. When we get home, we'll eat this together. I don't want to eat it together, I want to eat it by myself. Then, can I have another one? For her dad. Right. -Ceng? -Yes? Get another melon, Ceng. -Another one? -One more. Alright? Here it is. Another melon. Thank goodness, we got two. I think that's enough. Alright. Sir, I need to sign the check out papers, my hands are full. Can you hold these for me? -Just for a moment. -Oh right. I'll come back for them. Let me sign the papers first. Come on, this way. -Afternoon, Sir. -Afternoon. How long has he been sleeping? Since this noon. He won't wake up even when I offered him a meal. Alright, I'll kiss him. -Don't be a flirty man. -Break it. -He's mine. -Break him. Haven't you watched Snow White? The prince kissed her to wake her up. If you kiss him, you'll get up. Hold up, Win. Turns out that sleeping a lot is a sign of a drug user. Watch your mouth! Win, Ceng, look. "20 signs of a drug user." First... "Sleep a lot and hard to wake up." Legit. See? What else? "Always out of money and have debts." That's us. Something more specific. "Often go outside for a short time and return." People take out the trash that way, Jul. Who would dump the trash on Monday and return on Wednesday? Why are you mad at me? I was just reading an article. You're weird. Why spend a night out when dumping trash? Who told you to spend a night out when dumping your trash? -You did! -I didn't say that. Forgetful. Forgetfulness is a sign of a drug user. Why am I... Watch your mouth. I never used drugs. Hey, you're emotional. Being emotional is also a sign of a drug user. Just report him. Fine, I'll stay quiet. Let's just watch. Silently. Unstable emotions. Another sign of a drug user. Strike me dead. Fine, I do use drugs! Since I was a kid, my mom always told me, "Come here, Ijul." "Have some pills. Go smoke some weeds." "You'll go to Hell, or prison." Dead! Dead! He's upset. Hey, it's late. It's 10 o'clock. Time to sleep. -Don't forget to brush your teeth. -Alright. I'll go to bed first. Be patient. Laras needs time to accept you. It's been five years, Dear. How much longer will it take? Well... Three more years? Just kidding. Laras really likes sticky rice lupis. Prepare them sometimes. Take her heart. Hi. Hello, Ras. Are you busy? No, I'm just checking the emails. Perhaps there are some replies to our proposal. Oh right, how is it? Anyone responding? We got some response, but well... You know,"Alright, we'll contact you soon." Is that so? Ben. Can you visit the social service office? Alright, I'll go there tomorrow. Thank you. How's the guest house? This guest house is fun. I'm just not comfortablewith some people here. I have to see my step mother everyday. Well, you have to get used to it, Ras. If you become the guest house's manager, you'll be seeing her a lot. I don't know. It's difficult. It is difficult. But that doesn't mean you can't do it. It's up to you to give her a chance. What if I won't? I don't know about her. But if you ask me,I'll wait for that chance to come. Why? Because... You are worth the wait. Damn. Mr. Samsul. Have your medicine. I guess this much is done? -The color has changed. -Alright. Okay. Now, what else? Let's make the brown sugar sauce. Okay, the ingredients? Brown sugar, white sugar. Salt and cinnamon. How much is the white sugar? Add white sugar sufficiently. Well, how much is sufficient? Well, sufficiently. It says so here. Rin... How kind, someone sent me some food. I can tell from the smell that it's delicious. It's some kinda sticky rice dish. With red sugar, with coconut. -What's that, Sis? -Some lupis. Why are you so white? -Hey, guys. This is... -No. -Where did you get it? -You can't have this one. Take the ones on the table. I'm reviewing this. Ras, have some breakfast. We have some lupis. Not hungry. Astuti. -Yes, Dear? -Come here for a minute. -What's wrong, Dear? -Don't stay there. She'll eat them now. -Really? -Just watch, see? Laras is eating them, Dear. Oh, it's still too hot for her. Breakfast, Ras? No, I'm not hungry. ♪ Keep hoping that I would fall, and lay down ♪ ♪ I will prove to you ♪ ♪ Until my bones shine like gold ♪ -Not like this? -No. But 20 songs should be enough. Why would we perform 20 songs? We only got an hour, I'll be thirsty. -We only got an hour. -Performing 20 songs is my passion. 20 is a good number. -Not like that. -Fine. How do we go to Jakarta? Oh, I can borrow Laras' car. Yeah. Sir. Yes, Sir? Can I help you? Sir, I need to ask for a favor. What favor, Sir? My wife and I can't stand it anymore. We want to do it. Do what, Sir? That thing. You mean that thing? Yes, that thing! But here's the thing. I have a kid. I need you to take care of him, just for an hour. Actually, Sir, I'm... Please help me out, Sir. My wife is undressed. And I just ate lamb testicles. If she's undressed for too long, what if she catch a cold? Please help me. -Okay, Sir. But... -Okay. Honey, I'm coming. I'll go to our room. Don't! You can't go to your room. Why not, Uncle? Because it's only been 10 minutes. Your dad said... It's long enough, Uncle. Besides, this isn't the first time they leave me under someone else's care. Any question? Seriously, he said that? Seriously, it wasn't the first time they left him under someone else's care. Mr. Village Chief. Is your husband home? Enjoy your drink. Sorry for bothering. No, it's just coffee. Do you have something else? Dear... I was just kidding, Ma'am. But do you have any? That one's seriously a joke. My purpose here, aside from visiting Mr. Dahlan... Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Sanusi. Yes. Mr. Sanusi is a businessman. Like Mr. Dahlan. So, a businessman, a businessman. I'm just minding my own business. Ma'am. -Do you also own an inn? -No, Sir. Coincidentally, I run an entertainment place. Entertainment place, Sir. Amusement park? No, not like that. No. Mr. Dahlan, Mr. Sanusi would like to expand his business to this area. Perhaps Mr. Dahlan and Ma'am... ...would like to sell this guest house. Don't hesitate, Sir, Ma'am. Just cough up your price. Look. How about I start my bid at... Five billion? Mr. Dahlan, Ma'am... That's above the average price. Dear... Laras... Can I borrow your car? What for? I have a job in Jakarta, with Vega. What job? A gig. Are you sure you're having a gig? What do you mean? You two might use meth together in my car. We quit, Ras. All addicts say that. I'll let you borrow it. But Adam has to drive you. No. Nevermind. Thank you. Thank you for your offer. But the guest house is not for sale. Dad. I'm leaving. Don't come home late. Tomorrow's your turn, right? Mom. Yes, Dicky. There, there. Be patient. Be patient, okay?

Before you leave, don't forget to try our special menu. -Alright. -We'll finish the meal, don't worry. Hey... I'm having a small after-party. The stuff are prepared. You can join us, right? Alright. If you decide to join... ...just go into that room. Hey. We've come this far. Why do we have deficits? Have you ever make any withdrawal? Even if I did, it must've been registered in this book. Let me check that, Dad. The deficits are only at Dicky's turns. Dicky. Why are we missing money from the balance? Are you accusing me? Nobody's accusing. I was just asking. We're missing money. Do you know about it? Easy with the question. It's like you're talking to a thief. Nobody's accusing you as a thief. We found differences in the balance, Dicky. Which coincidentally happened at your turns. Just check it. -Well, how should I know, Bro? -What do you mean "How should I know"? You won't even look at the account book. You held the book at those days. Who made the calculation? I did. I made the calculation. So what? It could be that you miscalculated. Did I miscalculate or did you use the money on meth?! Adam. Dicky... You pieces of shit! -Dicky... -Dad, sit down. Sit down, Dad. Sit down. You are Mr. Dahlan's son, right? Sir, have mercy. Please don't tell my dad. -Hey. -I'm just... Calm down. Alright? I know you came here for some stuff. I'll give you as much as you like. For free. Want some? I just want to ask a small favor. I have a package that needs to be delivered tonight. I'll tell you the location. Can you do it? I can do it. Good. Give it to me. Enjoy. Well? How was it? -All good, Sir. -Good. Why did you dump it? It's just some rice flour. Hold still. Vega... Forgive me. Do you realize who we're dealing with? I know I was wrong. Now what should we do? They're not looking for you? My phone is turned off since last night. It's useless, they'll still find you. Trust me. Dicky... -Let's go to the police. -What do you mean the police? What should I say to the police? He's not at the office? No, Ma'am. I checked his office. His motorbike is gone, the key is gone. If his bike's gone, of course the key is gone too. I'm just informing, the bike's gone, and the key's gone too. I know. We all know that. Right, Sir, Ma'am? If the bike's gone, of course the key's gone too. What's with you, Win? You talk too much. Why are you snapping at me? Come, fight me! Hey, that's enough. Return to the guest house. -Sorry, Sir. -Sorry, Sir. It's Dicky, Dear. -Have you seen it? -Who's this? It's me, Sanusi. What did you do to my son? Hey, I was just helping. He came looking for stuff, but he had no money. Delete that video! I'll pay what he owes you, and we'll consider this clear. That's what I want. Coincidentally, Dicky is indebted to me. Last night, he ran away with my stuff. Do you know how much 3 kilograms of meth is worth? More than 5 billion. My son is not a thief! Are you sure?Have you asked Dicky? Look. Let's consider my stuff that Dicky took as the payment for the guest house. I've told you, the guest house is not for sale! I'll give you three days. If I don't get my stuff back... ...Dicky will face the consequences. It's true, right? You didn't take Sanusi's meth, right? No, Dad. I swear. He just asked me to deliver the stuff. But these three guys wearing masks beat me up. Can't you think straight? What drug dealer would let you carry 3 kilograms of his stuff? That's clearly his trick to set you up. If only we had sold the guest house to that person. It wouldn't be like this. It's not about that, Ti. It's about Dicky being set up. It's still his fault, Dad. He took the drugs. That's just Sanusi's trick. Why did he agree to it? Can you please? For once, stop blaming him. Can you please for once, admit it when he's wrong? It's not the time to decide who's wrong and who's right. It's time to solve your brother's problem. Why can't he solve his own problem? Because we're family! We're family! We will sell the guest house. This? This is what you call a family? When it comes to Dicky, you start mentioning "family". I shouldn't have returned to this house. It's a waste of time. I can't accept this. We had a deal from the start. I even resigned from my office to manage the guest house. Now you're just gonna hand it over to a drug dealer? This is for your brother, Adam. Yes, of course. Everything is for Dicky. What else must I do for you to consider me your child? What else must I do, Dad? I gave up everything since I was a kid. I've done everything that you wished for. Everything, Dad. Until I end up as a nobody! But to simply acknowledge that I exist... You can't even do that, can you? Laras? What's wrong, Dear? Ma'am... I'd like to tell you something. What did I tell you? You had a fight? No, it wasn't a fight. I... Three guys beat me up. Three guys! How were they? Dead? -Enough. -They're dead enough. What did I tell you? My chief. A hero. Boxing, boxing Holyfield. Wing Chun. That's not it. I gathered you all here... I have to tell you that starting next week... ...you don't have to come here anymore. Well, it's up to you, Sir. We gather in this office only when we're asked to. -True. -Right, guys? -As long as you're comfortable, Mr. Dicky. -How flirty. That's not what I mean. I mean you're all... Terminated. -Prank. -Oh, it's a prank! YouTube content! Where's the camera? Hi, guys. In this content, we're doing a prank, firing the employees. Where's the camera? No, I'm serious. I'm sorry. You're all fired. Please don't, Sir. How is this possible? This is my only job, my little sister is still in college. Please don't, Sir. You're just like all other guys! -What's wrong? -It's still locked. We'll go out together. -Is this for real, Sir? -It's a prank, right? No, it's not a prank. Please be a prank. Guys, please be a prank. Have some meal, Dear. Ti... Go see the Chief tomorrow. Perhaps he has another buyer with a better offer. Yes, Dear. But right now, you have to eat. Come on. Mr. Sanusi hasn't called you? But he asked for your husband's number. He said he wanted to negotiate with him. Did Mr. Sanusi run out of phone credit? But that's impossible, right? Actually... Mr. Sanusi called. -And then? -It's just... The price doesn't suit us. 5 billion doesn't suit you, Ma'am? It suits me. Please find us another buyer, Sir. Gosh. I can find another buyer. But it takes time, I can't find one tomorrow. Dicky! -This guy took my stuff. -Dicky! Bastard! Don't hurt my son! Old man, sit down! Sit down. I'll come back tomorrow, okay? You only have two options. Return my stuff. Or sign this sales contract. Dad... Dad... Dicky! How could I do that, Adam? You resigned before your contract was fulfilled. You're lucky you didn't have to pay the penalty. Yes, I understand, Ma'am. I also want to thank you for helping me all this time. But right now, I really need a job, Ma'am. I'm sorry, Dam. This time... I can't help you anymore. Be patient, Ras. Yeah. What about the social service? Any news? Well, you know. They said it would be difficult because... ...they have to prioritize the government-funded retirement homes. Ras... I think we have to relocate some of our residents there. Why are you saying that? What? Because that's what we must do. No. Ben, I've been dedicating my time. My energy, Ben. I've done all I could. Because I want to save everyone in this place. And that's what makes me admire you, Ras. You're like a lifeboat, trying to get everybody in. I know you mean well. But if the boat gets too heavy, we all will sink, Ras. If you'd like to read it first, or if you have any question, go ahead. Dear. Dear? Dahlan! Have some meal, let me feed you. Dad is gone. Dad is gone. Dad is gone. I need... ...your signatures. What for? We can only sell the guest house when all the heirs sign the contract. I won't sign it. -You can't do that, Bro. -Hey! So what if I won't sign it? Adam... I'm pleading you. This is your dad's will. You sure it was Dad's will? -You were there... -Shut up. I didn't ask you. -Ras... -What's with you, Mom? You've been hiding Dad's cancer from us. Why, Mom? Was it on purpose? This is Dahlan's request... -Nonsense! -To make sure none of you found out. From the start, you've been insisting on selling this guest house, right? How much share will you get from Sanusi? How much? Ten percent? Twenty percent? I swear to God, Ras... Bringing up God. I'm doing all this... For Dahlan. I just want to say... I'm happy to see you allfinally gathered again in this house. Since you all came, I only wished... ...that time could go slower. So I could be with you all longer. Sadly we cannot control time. Because time won't wait. I'm sorry for insisting Astutito keep this a secret. Try and talk to your children, Dear. I'm sure they're willingto become your donor. You know there's a risk, Ti. No! But the doctor said that it's a small risk. The donor's liver will recover... Ti, no matter how small the risk is, I won't harm my children, no! Fine. We'll find another donor. The cost is too high, Ti. It's impossible. Then sell the guest house, Dear. It will be enough for your surgery. If I sell the guest house... ...what else can I inherit to my children and you? Dear, I don't need inheritance. I just need you to live. I just need you, Dear. I'm begging you. Adam. Forgive me. For making you carry such a heavy burden. Just because I can't be fair. And you, Laras. Forgive me and Astuti, Child. We're just two lonely old people. Trying to carry on with life and make peace with each other's loss. Little Dicky. Dicky. I've been trying to redeem myself to you for my past mistakes. But I have failed. I have failed. Now I'm truly afraid. Truly afraid. But I'm not afraid of death, no. I'm afraid that I have to leave while being hated by my own children. Forgive me, my children. Ti, Astuti... I only ask for one thing. Take care of my children, Ti.Take care of them. Our children, Dear. Our children. Ma'am... Thank you for everything. We'll take our leave. Thank you for helping our family all this time. Forgive my husband, if he has ever done you wrong. Hello? Why did you do it, Dicky? It's enough, Mom. I've troubled a lot of people. So at least for once, please let me... ...take care of my own problem, Mom. Dicky... You still have us. As long as the police have no evidence... ...that Dicky was in possessionof drugs... ...he can't be charged as a dealer. The problem is, he took the urine test, and the result was positive. Yes, it proves that Dicky is a user. Not a dealer. That's why we can applyfor a rehabilitation without a trial. Hey, don't forget. We'll have a new delivery coming tomorrow. Who will pick it up? The two of us, Sir. Police, don't move! Don't move! Hands up! Okay. Standby at 3 AM, alright, Jul? Okay, I'll be ready. What's wrong with you? Your friend here, Aceng. He wears too much perfume. You know, a new guy, hoping to get more. Sorry. Alright, have a nice work. I'll pick you up later. -Okay. -Take care. What perfume are you wearing? It smells unusual. The usual, see? Gosh, you're such a fool. That's a car perfume. Why did you use that? You mean I can't use it on a motorbike? It's not about the vehicle. Your passenger was nauseous. You're embarrassing me. Maybe she's having a cold. This kid keeps answering. It's Ms. Laras. Ijul... They're not firing us. We can work again. Aceng! Get rid of that. Is this much done, Sis? No. It is. It's done since quite a while. Take it off the stove. Now it's done. Turn off the stove? Mom, I'll save all of the chicken legs for Dicky. Not all of them. Save some for Adam. He likes them too. BALAI CEMARA REHABILITATION CENTER We brought yousome coconut milk chicken. Vega cooked them for you, it's special. I was just stirring, your mom taught me everything. -Take care, okay? -Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Bro. -Take care. -We have to go. -Eat well. -Thanks, Ras. You'll still give me some time, right? Little Dicky. The third vote... Dicky. Each receives one vote. That means this final vote will decide. Alright? And the newly elected leader is... Okay. Laras. Congratulations, Ms. Laras! Congratulations. Congratulations, Ras. Thank you. Friends, thank you for voting for me. But... I think Adam deserves it more. I will hand it to you, Bro. Are you serious? I'm serious.
