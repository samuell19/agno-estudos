SOMEBODY HELP! PREVIOUSLY ON "SECRETS AND LIES"... MR. CRAWFORD, DETECTIVE CORNELL. Ben: JESS, TOM'S MOTHER, SHE WORKS PART-TIME. MY DAUGHTER NATALIE BABYSAT HIM. I WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK. SO DO I, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. WHAT ELSE HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME? NOTHING. WE'D LIKE TO GET A DNA SAMPLE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? YOU FOUND THE BODY. YOU WERE INSIDE THE CRIME SCENE. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE. DIDN'T WE GET ONE LIKE THAT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO? I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WENT. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, MR. CRAWFORD? DID YOU KILL TOM? Ben: I DIDN'T KILL TOM. THE DNA SAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE US, WE TESTED IT AGAINST TOM'S. YOU DID KNOW THAT TOM WAS YOUR SON? [ RUSTLING ] DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW THAT TOM WAS MY SON? NO. NOT UNTIL TODAY. DETECTIVE CORNELL? JESS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW I WOULD NEVER HURT TOM. I BELIEVE YOU. WHY? BECAUSE I KNOW WHO DID IT. I FOUND YOU! [ BOTH LAUGHING ] I FOUND YOU! TICKLE YOU! CAREFUL. IT'S HOT. I KNOW THERE WERE PROBLEMS, BUT -- BUT YOU SAW SCOTT HOW EVERYONE ELSE DOES -- A BRAVE SOLDIER, A LOVING FATHER. BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM, NOT REALLY. AFTER HE GOT BACK FROM HIS LAST TOUR... SCOTT WAS DIFFERENT. HE WAS ANGRY AND VIOLENT. I WAS SCARED OF MY OWN HUSBAND. [ SIGHS ] BUT TO HURT TOM, I... ALL RIGHT. SEE FOR YOURSELF. [ BUTTONS CLICKING ] [ JESS PANTING ] [ GLASS SHATTERS ] Scott: CRAZY BITCH! I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THIS ANYMORE! YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND! NOW GET OUT OF HERE! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! GET OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT -- DADDY! TOM, GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM! DADDY, NO! IT'S OKAY, PEANUT. I'LL BE THERE TO TUCK YOU IN. I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, HUH?! HOW MANY TIMES CAN I TELL YOU? IT'S OVER! I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU TAKE MY SON! IT'S OVER! YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY SON! [ JESS SCREAMS ] SCOTT WAS ABOUT TO DEPLOY FOR THE FIFTH TIME. HE LEFT THE BASE AND JUST REFUSED TO GO BACK. HE WENT AWOL? IF THE M.P.s FIND SCOTT, HE GOES TO THE BRIG, SO HE LEFT. AND THAT'S WHEN I GOT THE RESTRAINING ORDER. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, WHY DO YOU THINK -- BUT I KNOW HE'S AROUND. HOW? HERE, LOOK. I DIDN'T BUY THIS FOR TOM. HIS TEACHERS DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM, BUT I DO. I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW HOW SCOTT GOT IT TO HIM. IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE SCOTT LOVED TOM. [ Voice breaking ] YEAH, BUT HE HATED ME MORE. YOU KNOW, AFTER I ENDED THINGS, SCOTT WANTED ME TO SUFFER. AND WHAT BETTER WAY... THAN TO TAKE MY CHILD? DOES... SCOTT KNOW -- THAT YOU'RE THE FATHER? NO. SCOTT WOULD KILL YOU... AND ME. NOBODY ELSE KNOWS... ...UNLESS YOU TOLD CHRISTY. YOU HAVE TO TELL THE POLICE ABOUT SCOTT. I DID. I TOLD DETECTIVE CORNELL. [ SIGHS ] WHERE WOULD HE HIDE OUT? I DON'T KNOW. I-I MEAN, HIS ARMY BUDDIES, RICK AND BAXTER, THEY STAY AT THE CAPTAIN'S COVE RENTALS. Nicole: JESS? UM, YOU REMEMBER MY SISTER NICOLE, RIGHT? HI. I HAVE SOME MORE IN THE CAR. OKAY. I SHOULD PROBABLY -- NO, I'LL -I'LL GO. Woman: THERE HE IS! Man: COME ON, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK! MR. CRAWFORD, HOW'S JESS? [ REPORTERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] Man #2: GOING TO THE FUNERAL? YOU NEED SOME HELP WITH THOSE? NO. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. NEITHER DOES MY SISTER. Woman: BEN, PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR A COMMENT. Man: CAN WE GET A STATEMENT, PLEASE? Man #2: NICOLE, WHY ARE YOU MAD AT HIM? [ REPORTERS CONTINUE SHOUTING ] Woman: BEN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THE PEOPLE THAT THINK YOU DID IT? OH, OF COURSE. I CAN MEET YOU THERE ON TUESDAY. THE 5-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS FOUND MURDERED NEAR HIS HOME IN CHARLOTTE -- THEY'VE GOT THE GUY. WHY ISN'T HE IN JAIL? YES, IT'S A TWO-STORY PROPERTY. PLAYING JUDGE, JURY, AND EXECUTIONER AGAIN, GRETCHEN? YES, I AM, BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS TO SPEAK UP. WELL, OF COURSE, BUT GOING AFTER THE WRONG PERSON CAN RUIN THEIR LIFE. CRAWFORD DID IT, NO QUESTION. WHAT? I UNDERSTAND. ALL DUE RESPECT, UNLESS YOU WERE THERE, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION. PLEASE. HE JUST HAPPENED TO GO -- MM-HMM. THANK YOU. HEY. HEY. [ SIGHS ] SO, WHERE YOU BEEN? I WAS TALKING TO JESS. HOW IS SHE? SHE BELIEVES ME. CHRISTY, SHE THINKS SCOTT KILLED TOM. SHE SAID HE WENT CRAZY WHEN SHE BROKE IT OFF. SHE HAD TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER AND -- WE'VE KNOWN SCOTT FOR YEARS. HE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING BUT KIND. I-I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU HEAR WAR DOES THINGS TO PEOPLE. [ DOOR OPENS ] Abby: I'M HOME! HEY, THERE SHE IS. Natalie: WAIT HERE. COPS ARE HERE... FOR A CHANGE. [ SIGHS ] MM. YEAH? MR. CRAWFORD, WE NEED YOU TO COME TO THE STATION. WHY? I'M SURE DETECTIVE CORNELL WILL EXPLAIN. DON'T YOU GUYS NEED TO GO THROUGH MY LAWYER? WELL, NO. YOU'RE NOT UNDER ARREST AT THE MOMENT, SO THERE'S NO CUSTODIAL ISSUES. AND IF I REFUSE TO COME? I ASSUME DETECTIVE CORNELL WILL COME HERE. LOOK, I REALIZE IT'S AN INCONVENIENCE SINCE YOU WERE ALREADY DOWN THERE THIS MORNING. Christy: YOU WERE? UM, UH -- JUST GET IT OVER WITH. [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] [ SIGHS ] [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] [ DOOR OPENS ] I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU DOWN HERE AGAIN, MR. CRAWFORD. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? HONESTLY, A CONFESSION WOULD BE NICE. IF YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB, YOU'D BE GETTING ONE FROM SCOTT MURPHY. JESS TOLD YOU WHAT HE DID TO THEIR HOUSE, HOW HE'S VIOLENT. WHEN EXACTLY DID JESS TELL YOU? HE DIDN'T WANT HER TO HAVE HIS SON. YOU MEAN YOUR SON. WHY AM I HERE? I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE CORONER HAS OFFICIALLY RULED TOM'S CAUSE OF DEATH TO BE BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA. AND, ALSO, WE FINALLY DETERMINED THE EXACT MAKE AND MODEL OF THE FLASHLIGHT USED TO MURDER YOUR SON. IT'S MARVELOUS WHAT FORENSICS CAN TELL US. SEE, BY TAKING A MOLD... OF THE BLUDGEONED AREA AND MATCHING IT TO A VARIETY OF MAKES AND MODELS, THE CRIMINOLOGIST -- WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? I'M TRYING TO SOLVE YOUR SON'S MURDER. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO TAKE A LIE-DETECTOR TEST RIGHT NOW. Danny: WELL, THIS IS BORDERING ON HARASSMENT. OH, NO NEED FOR HYPERBOLE, MR. PIERCE. I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE HERE, FRANKLY. WHY'S THAT? CRIMINAL LAW'S NOT REALLY YOUR THING, IS IT? WELL, I DID GO TO LAW SCHOOL. YES. WE GRADUATED THE SAME YEAR. MR. CRAWFORD WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH. W-WELL, W-W-WE'RE GONNA -- THIS IS SOMETHING -- YES, YOU MAY CONFER WITH YOUR CLIENT, MR. PIERCE. CHRISTY CALLED YOU? YEAH. YOU'RE LUCKY SHE DID. POLYGRAPH RESULTS ARE NOT ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. THEY'RE EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE, WHICH IS WHY THEY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES. BUT IT CAN SHOW THEM THAT I'M INNOCENT. NO, OR GUILTY. I DIDN'T KILL TOM. [ CLICK ] YOUR HOME IS ON CHELSEA BAY DRIVE? YES. [ CLICKING ] HAVE YOU EVER LIED? YES. HAVE YOU LIED TO DETECTIVE CORNELL? I, UH... NO. [ SIGHS ] DID YOU GO TO THE MURPHY HOME THE NIGHT BEFORE TOM WAS DISCOVERED? NO. PRIOR TO FINDING OUT FROM DETECTIVE CORNELL, DID YOU KNOW THAT TOM MURPHY WAS YOUR BIOLOGICAL SON? NO. DID YOU KILL TOM MURPHY? NO. I TOLD YOU NOT TO PROVIDE YOUR DNA. YOU DIDN'T LISTEN. NOW YOU'RE KEEPING CRITICAL INFORMATION FROM ME? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING? DOES CHRISTY KNOW? I HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT TIME TO TELL HER. THERE IS NO RIGHT TIME. MY CLIENT REQUESTED THE POLYGRAPH, SO YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO SHARE THE RESULTS. THE TEST WAS INCONCLUSIVE. SO, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS YOU NEED A CRIMINAL ATTORNEY. I'M WAY OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE. [ DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ] UM, THIS IS BEN CRAWFORD. DANNY PIERCE TOLD ME TO GIVE -- HE DID? 2:00 IS GREAT. YEAH, THANKS. DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN. YEAH, IT WAS LATE, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU. WHAT DID CORNELL WANT THIS TIME? JUST... MORE QUESTIONS, AND... [ SIGHS ] I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT I WENT DOWN TO THE STATION EARLIER 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY. [ CHUCKLES DRYLY ] LITTLE LATE FOR THAT. WHY DOES SHE KEEP WANTING TO TALK TO YOU? I MEAN, SHE CAN'T SERIOUSLY THINK -- SHE DOES. WHY? [ SCOFFS ] THIS IS BAD. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, CHRISTY, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T DO IT. I'VE GOT AN EARLY SHOWING. CAN YOU MAKE SURE THE GIRLS ARE UP? YEAH. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] Natalie: I'LL SAY I'M GOING CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AFTER SCHOOL. SERIOUSLY, THEY WON'T FIND OUT. WELL, THEN, WHEN? THE FUNERAL'S TOMORROW. BY THE ENTRANCE TO THE BIKE PATH. OKAY. I GOT TO GO. BYE. HEY, IS YOUR SISTER UP? MY SHOWERHEAD'S BROKEN. I NEED YOURS. ALL RIGHT. I'LL FIX IT LATER. [ BUTTONS CLICKING ] [ Ringing ] MAN: Nat? Natalie, are you there? Nat? DANNY AND ME -- WE GO BACK. THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE MEETING. DANNY TOLD YOU I'M NOT GUILTY, RIGHT? WELL, NO ONE IS. UH, I-I DON'T WANT TO KNOW EITHER WAY. [ SCOFFS ] WELL, THEN, HOW CAN YOU HELP ME IF -- I CAN'T HELP YOU -- I MEAN, NOT NOW. YOU CAN'T AFFORD ME. RETAINER'S 10 GRAND. HOURLY'S $300. YOU'RE A HOUSE PAINTER ON THE VERGE OF DIVORCE. YOUR REALTOR WIFE MAKES ALL THE MONEY. THERE'S NO UPSIDE FOR ME UNTIL YOU GET ARRESTED. [ SIGHS ] WELL, IF I'M ARRESTED, I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD YOU. YEAH, BUT AT THAT POINT, THERE'S A CLEAR BENEFIT TO ME. YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TRIED IN THE PRESS. EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE GUILTY. WHEN YOU'RE ARRESTED, THEN I'M YOUR FIRST CALL. AND WHEN I GET YOU OFF, I'M THE GUY THAT GOT AN ACQUITTAL FOR KID-KILLER BEN CRAWFORD, JOINING THE RANKS OF THE SIMPSON AND ANTHONY DEFENDERS. IT GIVES ME MY NEXT 50 PAYING CLIENTS. YOU'RE A JERK. YEAH. I AM. THANKS. [ SIGHS ] RIGHT, HA-HANG ON A S-- WAIT A SECOND. [ SIGHS ] YOU SEEM LIKE A DECENT GUY. DANNY LIKES YOU, SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE FREE ADVICE. CORNELL'S EXCEPTIONAL AT WHAT SHE DOES. NOW SHE'S ALL OVER YOU LIKE FLIES ON CRAP, AND SHE'S GOT GOOD REASON TO BE. YOU FOUND THE BODY. THAT'S ALWAYS CAUSE FOR CONCERN. THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY. YOUR DAUGHTER HAS A KEY. I DIDN'T DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. ONCE THE COPS LIKE A SUSPECT, IT BECOMES ALL ABOUT PROVING THAT THAT PERSON -- IN THIS CASE, YOU -DID IT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA VEER OFF-COURSE UNLESS THEY HAVE REASON TO STRONGLY SUSPECT SOMEONE ELSE. AND IF THEY FIND THE MURDER WEAPON... AND IT'S YOURS, YOU'RE SCREWED. [ VEHICLE APPROACHES ] Ben: SCOTT? NATALIE! [ CAR HORN BLARES ] [ TIRES SCREECHING, CAR HORNS BLARING ] [ ENGINE REVVING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! Ben: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?! SCOTT IS DANGEROUS! YOU ARE SO WRONG! HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY. NAT, ARE YOU -- WHAT'S GOING ON? HIS OWN WIFE SAID HE'S VIOLENT AND UNSTABLE. YOU -YOU -YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM. I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING YOU SAY. YES, YOU DO! NO, I DON'T! NAT! NO! [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] HEY, MAN, I'M -I'M HERE TO SEE RICK AND BAXTER. I ALWAYS FORGET WHICH ONE IS THEIRS. YEAH. RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, NUMBER NINE. TELL THEM JONAS SAYS HI. WILL DO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE ] HEY, MAN. SCOTT AROUND? YOU KNOW WHERE SCOTT MURPHY IS? [ CHUCKLES ] WHY WOULD WE TELL YOU? 'CAUSE I'M A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY. LOOK, UM... YOU SHOULD GO, BEN CRAWFORD. TELL SCOTT I'M LOOKING FOR HIM. WHAT'S GOING ON? OKAY. ABBY, HON, PLEASE GO UPSTAIRS. WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO LEAVE? THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU. PLEASE. OUR DAUGHTER IS HIDING A RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOTT MURPHY. HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND. NATALIE, I SAW SCOTT TAKE YOUR HAND. THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU. YOU SAW HIM... GIVE ME THIS, HIS SILVER STAR, TO PUT ON HIS SON'S COFFIN. JESS WON'T LET HIM COME AROUND, NOT EVEN FOR THE FUNERAL. I FELT BAD. DID YOU LET SCOTT SEE TOM? OKAY, A FEW TIMES WHEN I BABYSAT, I LET HIM MEET US AT THE PARK. NATALIE, JESS TRUSTED... JUST BECAUSE SCOTT AND JESS SPLIT UP DOESN'T MEAN HE SHOULDN'T GET TO SEE HIS SON! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SCOTT'S CAPABLE OF. OH, AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! YOU ARE NOT TO SEE SCOTT ANYMORE. END OF DISCUSSION. [ SIGHS ] RIGHT. LET'S GO. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] GO ON. GO GET ON THE BUS, MATTY. GIVE MOMMY A HUG. OH, OH, OKAY. GO, GO, GO, GO. GO ON. GO GET ON THE BUS. Scott: CRAZY BITCH! YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND! Jess: SCOTT, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THIS! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?! GET OUT OF HERE! [ INDISTINCT SCREAMING ] WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! SCOTT, STOP IT! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! GET OUT! WHAT ELSE AREN'T YOU TELLING ME, JESS?! GET AWAY FROM HER! NO! LEAVE HIM ALONE! LET HIM GO! [ GASPING ] SCOTT, YOU'RE KILLING HIM! LET HIM GO! SCOTT, LET HIM GO! CALL THE POLICE. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE TEST SAYS. THAT WAS MY BOY. [ COUGHS ] [ COUGHS ] Woman: WAIT. [ SCOFFS ] DAVE... [ DOOR OPENS ] BEN... ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I GOT IT. [ SIGHS ] IT WAS, UH, SCOTT, AND I... WHY WOULD HE... DID HE FIND OUT YOU SLEPT WITH JESS? [ SIGHS ] YEAH. WHERE DID YOU SEE HIM? WELL, I WAS OUT RUNNING, AND I-I HEARD YELLING, SO I WENT TO HELP. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE POLICE? 'CAUSE HE WAS GOING AFTER JESS. DID HE HURT HER? SO JUST YOU, THEN. [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] IT WAS, UM...

[ SIGHS ] SCOTT. SCOTTY? CAPTAIN AMERICA? YEAH. I'M SURPRISED YOU MADE IT OUT ALIVE. [ CHUCKLES ] ISN'T HE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE RUN OR SOMETHING? HE IS. UH, OKAY. WELL, WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM ANGRY, BEN? LISTEN, MAN, YOU GOT TO STOP WITH THE GIRLS. I THINK THEY PREFER TO BE CALLED "LADIES." DAVE, I'M -I'M SERIOUS. I GOT DAUGHTERS. THE GIRLS DIDN'T SEE IT, MAN. THIS TIME. BUT IF CHRISTY CATCHES YOU AGAIN, YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS. OKAY. [ SIGHS ] I'LL HIDE THEM BETTER. I'LL -I'LL -- I'LL GET THINNER ONES? [ Laughing ] I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

SHE'S, LIKE, LYING AND SNEAKING AROUND AND... MM-HMM. ...SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT CHRISTY OR ME. BUT SHE DOES TALK TO YOU. SO... YOU'LL TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT, RIGHT? OH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, BUDDY. I GOT YOUR BACK. OKAY? YOU WANT A BEER? IT'S LIKE 8:30. IS IT? [ CAR HORNS HONKING ] [ ELEVATOR DINGS ] [ TELEPHONES RINGING ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] MR.

YES, YOU FOUND HIM IN HIS OWN HOME, INTO WHICH YOU WERE NOT INVITED. NICOLE DID CALL YOU. I HEARD FIGHTING. HAVE A SEAT. MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE ATTACKING A DECORATED SPECIAL-FORCES COMMANDER. I DIDN'T ATTACK. HE WAS GOING AFTER JESS. YOU HIT HIM. YEAH. MORE THAN ONCE? HE HIT ME, TOO. WELL, THAT'S IT FROM A TRAINED SOLDIER? HE MUST HAVE BEEN SHOWING SOME RESTRAINT. NO! HE -- HE CHOKED ME AND... DID SCOTT SAY ANYTHING TO YOU? YEAH. HE SAID THAT THE DNA TEST DIDN'T MATTER AND THAT HE WAS STILL TOM'S FATHER. DID THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY? NO. ARE YOU EMBARRASSED THAT TOM IS YOUR SON? NO. I DIDN'T HIT SCOTT. HE -- HE WAS GOING -- GOING AFTER JESS. SO YOU SAID. AND YOU WERE AFRAID THAT HE WAS GONNA HURT HER, AND THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE, BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER. I MEAN, YOU DID HAVE A CHILD WITH HER. I'M MARRIED. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. TOM WAS A MISTAKE? SLEEPING WITH JESS WAS A MISTAKE. A MISTAKE THAT YOU WANTED TO KEEP SECRET. WE DID KEEP IT SECRET. WE DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. WERE YOU AFRAID THAT SCOTT WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT TOM? NO! I-I DIDN'T KNOW TOM WAS MINE UNTIL YOU TOLD ME. YOU THINK... I BEAT TOM TO DEATH SO CHRISTY WOULDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT A ONE-NIGHT STAND? WELL, SHE KNOWS. OH, SO YOU TOLD HER THAT TOM IS YOUR SON? [ SCOFFS ] YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO A DAMN THING. IT WOULD LIKELY BE THROWN OUT, COMSINCE YOU ATTACKED HIM.RP HE MAY EVEN COUNTER WITH CHARGES OF HIS OWN. IT'S UP TO YOU.

HE LIKED THAT -THAT SONG FROM -FROM PITBULL. REALLY? "YO MAMA, SHE GETS KRAZY." [ LAUGHS ] SO, NICOLE AND I WERE WORKING OUT ONCE, AND THE SONG WAS PLAYING. I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS PAYING ATTENTION, BUT [LAUGHS] FOR MONTHS, HE'D JUST JUMP AROUND THE HOUSE, SINGING WHATEVER HE THOUGHT THE WORDS WERE, AND USUALLY WITH NO PANTS ON. [ BOTH LAUGH ] WHAT A WEIRDO. [ Sobbing ] HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I CAN'T -- I CAN'T DO THIS. [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] [ SOBBING ] YES, YOU CAN. YOU CAN DO THIS. YEAH. NO, NO.

HEY, MATTY, LISA. IS TYLER BACK ALREADY? NO, NO. MATTY'S CONFUSED. Chaplain: GOOD MORNING. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT WHEN DEATH COMES, IT'S GOD CALLING US, EMBRACING OUR SOUL IN ITS ETERNAL FORM. WHEN FACED WITH TRAGEDY, I MUST BELIEVE THAT. TOM WAS A GIFT -- LOVING, SMART, HAPPY. EVEN NOW I HEAR HIS LAUGHTER, AND I KNOW HE'S SAFELY IN THE CRADLE OF GOD'S ARMS, AND HE'S SMILING DOWN FROM HEAVEN. [ "RAINBOW CONNECTION" PLAYING ] ? RAINBOWS ARE VISIONS, BUT ONLY ILLUSIONS ? ?

I'M AWARE OF THAT, AND I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, BUT I LEFT YOU SEVERAL MESSAGES. YOU COULDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE FOR JUST ONE DAY? AS I SAID ON THE PHONE, IT'S URGENT. HAD YOU STAYED ON THE LINE OR CALLED ME BACK, I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE ON YOUR PORCH. ALL RIGHT, WHAT? WHAT IS IT? THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE CRIME LAB, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE PRESS NOW KNOWS THAT TOM WAS YOUR SON. I TRIED TO HOLD THEM OFF FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, BUT THE STORY IS COMING OUT. Man: A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE MURDER CASE OF 5-YEAR-OLD TOM MURPHY. SOURCES CLAIM A STARTLING DISCOVERY WAS MADE BY POLICE SEVERAL DAYS AGO, WHEN A DNA SAMPLE SUBMITTED BY BEN CRAWFORD REVEALED THAT HE IS THE BOY'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER. NOW, TOM MURPHY'S BODY WAS DISCOVERED BY CRAWFORD, AND THAT HAS MADE HIM A PERSON OF INTEREST IN THIS CASE. [ DOOR CLOSES ] AT THIS TIME, WE ARE NOT CERTAIN IF THIS NEW INFORMATION WILL CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE INVESTIGATION. NAT... OBVIOUSLY, THE PATERNITY IS -- [ TV SHUTS OFF ] [ FOOTSTEPS, DOOR SLAMS ] Ben: CHRISTY, PLEASE. PLEASE LET -LET ME... [ RAIN FALLING ] THAT FOR ME? YOU'LL FIND OUT CHRISTMAS MORNING.
