Tell me I'm seeing things. Nope, it's coming straight at us, alright. I don't believe it. It gets easier every time. Oh, you bragging up complaining. Complaining? It's getting to be boring. Oh yeah. Oh, how are you? Oh, it's a nice little trip. Oh, we're so glad you join us out here. Rocco, get the boys ready. Capitan, get ready. Lopez, get that gun ready. Anggie, you ready? Yeah. Rocco, you ready? Si. Fire across the boat! Let's go! Alright, just settle down and no one gets hurt. What's happening? It's hold up, dumbo. These aren't girls, they're pirates. Pirates? Like Errol Flynn? Where's they're sword? Will this do, love? Buenas noches. Good evening. We have a boat in the harbor. That is very nice. Boats are very nice. I understand your the man we talk to about unloading our cargo here. You have fish? A little more valuable than fish. I always makes arrangements for unloading fish. Is there anyone else we can talk to? Capitan Infante. Oh, no, no. Somebody other than the capitan. Somebody a little, um... A little grow? A little. Capitan Infante. Hey. A police captain makes very little money. I have a big family. One has to make ends meet somehow. What did you say you want to sell? Everything but the boat. Oh, that sounds very interesting. We like to unload as soon as possible. Tomorrow. No business tonight. Tonight is fiesta night. Tomorrow is bound to be a fiesta. We have a fiesta for everything. A fiesta when it rains, a fiesta when it stop raining. A fiesta when a woman gives birth, a fiesta when someone gets divorced, everyday is fiesta time. Why not? Our life is a big fiesta. Oh, come on we're in a big hurry. Tomorrow, tomorrow. But tonight. You are my guests. Just be happy, eat drink and dance and do anything that will make you happy. I have to see someone. I thought you weren't doing business tonight. El Turko is one of my best costumers. We got work to do. Well, well, El Turko is trying to move on our territory. Goddammit, Turko is beginning to bug me. Me too. You've been complaining of boredom. What do you say we hit him? Come on, come on! Get on boat! Let's go! Now, Turko, how would it be? Put down the arms, boys. Baby, remember is that the score does favor. Someday I'll get you for this. Rocco. Turko, now you got no score to settle! Rocco, help Pedro to gas up first thing in the morning. Yeah. Oh, Rocco, clean my gun. This afternoon, it jammed. Will do. Where's my kiss? Oh, wait till you see what I have. For me, really? Sure, who else? Thank you. I love you, I love you, Kelly. Mama, mama. Fortunata. You're useless, useless. And you say you are a brave man? And swore as fucking pirate? Then well, what are you doing hiding behind my skirt, he? Kelly, Kelly. If you say you are half the man you are, you go to talk to her yourself. Come on, ada! Welcome home, Kelly. Welcome home. Fortunata and I were just talking about you. I was just telling her about our raid. Remember Maracaibo? The raid on Sea Fuego. The sorties Leeward Islands. Those were the says. There wasn't a sailor in the Seven Seas wouldn't tremble in the mention Crossbone Kelly. I would've loved to see the look on Turko's face. Nina, come on, nina, you can give me a hand, eh. Come on, come on, Anggie. Hiding at that dreaded turkey is nothing more than dreaded duck. Do you know what that makes us, Kelly? Top dog. Do you understand, Capitan? Top dog. Anggie, andale. Sandra's gone. What happened? You know your sister head like a rock when she makes up her mind. A week ago, I wake up, she's gone. Wat do you want me to do? Tie her up to a tree? If you keep your eyes open always instead of sleeping, you are always a sleeping. I'm sorry, Kelly. Where did she go? Do you have any idea where she went? When little Sandra gets out of camp, she doesn't leave or write in a diary. Don't get sassy with me, Sancho. Just wait until I lay my hands on her. At Santo Domingo, she has friends there. I tried everywhere else. No, sir. If she wants out, she can damn well stay out. Senorita Kelly. No, I mean it this time. I am tired of babysitting for that brat. From now on, every man is for himself. Cut the crap, Kelly. Let's go. We'll reach Santo Domingo by dawn tomorrow. She's not here. I can tell by the look on Sancho's face. Wait here, I'll be right back. She's nowhere to be found. Madre de Dios, I could kill her. Let's hope no one's beat you to it. Life ain't easy on these parts. Excuse me, have you seen a girl with a big natural, wearing beads? She's about 5'7", my complexion. Ah, yeah, yeah. South of Suarez. Thank you. Sancho, take us south of Suarez. What for? That's no man's land. They tell me they a black girl singing in there before. It might turn out to be Sandy, yet. Madre de Dios, Kelly. That's no man's land. Please, Kelly, please. Oh, lighten up, Sancho. It's not that bad. Someone wants to see you. Oh, yeah, where? Oh, yeah. You wanna see me? Yes, I'm looking for someone. Oh, yeah? Now maybe I can help you out. How about coming up to my office. We'll talk about that. Sure. What a bunny. What a bunny. Oh la la. Please, don't touch. No, I don't touch. I say. I like you. In your language, I say, I've got the blues. You come out on, okay? Coffee, please. Black, very hot. Go refill, will you? Why don't you leave, huh? That's gonna keep happening as long as you keep sitting here. Oh, it doesn't bother me. As long as you keep filling up that glass. You're the first American girl who ever stayed here long enough for a refill. I like you. You got a lot of spunk. I like you but you still didn't tell about my sister. Oh yeah, your sister. I remember her. Sandra, I think her name was. She worked for me for a couple of days and then she just disappeared. Hey, wait a minute. Why don't you, won't you stay here and work for me, huh? No, thanks. Yeah sure, but I want you. Oh, how fragile. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I can make you very happy here, baby. Oh, you wanna make me happy? Open this door. I will, I will. How about of you give me a little pleasure first, huh? Oh come on. Babe, come on. I like it when a girl struggles. I like it when a man doesn't get what he wants. Get over here! Stop this! You're hurting my arm! Take that fuck in you, you slob! Some people can't take yes for an answer. That's it, baby. Now you got the idea. That's just the way I like it. You're a sick man. What's happening over there! Open up! Open up! Grab her! That bitch was trying to rob me! Oh sure. Kelly. Kelly! Go. Kelly, eh. Kelly. Kelly! So, where do we go from here? I don't know. Maybe the next town, I guess. You know how Sandy is. She's probably making all her round with all the boards. Like she always said, "I'm trying to find myself." Good morning. May I join you? We we're just leaving. It will just take a minute. Clemente Navarro. I'm with the justice department. Which of you is Kelly Harrington. Neither of us, if you're here on business. It's so far from being business. Not even my own staff knows I'm here. I understand you're looking for your sister. We were just getting ready to move up the coast. I can save you some time. You're sister is not up the coast. Do you know where she is? Where? Is she alive? She's alive but in trouble. She's been kidnapped. Oh, no. You want to see your sister? I can help. But I want you to do something for me. You see, there's a gang of kidnappers. Victimizing unescorted women in the remote sections of town. They work for a sadist called Monteiro. That's where Sandra is? He is gotten up a reef. Bound by forests and swamps. Very strategic and quite impregnable. They call the area Salir Si Puedes, which is Spanish for get out if you can. That's cute. The few have been to the camp say that it's nothing more than a coffee plantation. But I know different. But I have no proof. I set one of my people in a few month ago and made her pose as a prostitute. They fell for it. She was supplying us with information about Monteiro's activities. But we haven't heard from Joyce for weeks. And I need someone to go in there. And be, well, or a lack of a better word... Spies? Are you sure Sandy is there? Yes. That we know. And we also know the kind of business you're engaged in. We're willing to let bygones to be bygones. That is, if you cooperate. Otherwise, we will go to the embarrassing ordeal of arresting you. Thereby, preventing you from saving your sister. How do we get in to this Monteiro plantation? Getting in easy, but getting out, that's another story. Just get us in, we worry about getting out. Right, Sancho? Imagine if you knew this was the keys. There's a lot of work to be done around here. Our rules are simple enough. Obey them without question and you will be treated well. If you don't, you'll get yourself into a lot of trouble. Welcome Salir Si Puede. Ah, this buzz is driving me crazy! Hi. We're gonna roommate for a long time. So I think we better get to know each other. I'm Marcie. Angela. I've been here eight months. I'm the trustee here. Well, I guess that's my problem. You see, I trusted this dude who said he was gonna set me up real nice and comfy life, he set me up, alright. He set me up right here. Well, enough of that. What are you two black beauties doing in a nice place like this? We're pirates. And I'm Snow White. Come on. Alright, it was a bunch of girls and myself. We saw this ad in this Burghley bar. This rich dude wanted some girls to have them sail his yacht around the world. No experience necessary, right? Sounds like here. Come as you are. Well, the yacht turned out to be a bathtub. The captain got broke, he split and there we were. We taked up NGU in Paraguay. I was slinging hash with tourists in a hotel coffee shop when I met Kelly and her sister. They asked me to join them. I said why not? Time for me to take my destiny in my hands. Then one big adventure instead, huh. This is just another glamorous stop on our global tour. I never did like coffee in the morning. There's a lucky one. And that's Barrows. He's what you call a peculiar in the flesh market. If he likes you, he pay Montiero and then it's hot bath, good food and soft bed from then on. Sandy! You know her? It ain't helping but at least they give you decency of a shower after work. It's not too bad once you get used to it. I could never get used to being caged in. Yeah, well, I know what you mean but I had to get used to it. You make the best of this situation, you'll survive. Honey, we're not staying. Didn't you know? There's no way out. Huh, there's my way. Well, I was just trying to make conversation. What's she so uptight about? Her sister. Well, I'm not her sister. Her sister's been missing for about a month now. Oh. Nobody knows where she is. That sounds bad. Maybe you can help. How? They say she might have been brought here. That's why we came. How old is she? 16. Did she have curly black hair and sort of a kinda wild and had bangles and beads on? Yeah, yeah. That's Sandra. Sandra Harrington? Kelly! Yeah? She's here. Sandy's here. Well, not really. What's happened to her? You see, she escaped two days ago with a girl, Joyce. Marcie, what are her chances out there? Bad, very bad. She got out, didn't she? They'll get them. They always do. Shit. They found her, heaven help us. What are you talking about? She's been caught. She's badly beaten up. Out. Out, out! You, stay there. You, you, hear me out. Better back, beat it. Yeah you, you. That's Serena. She got sent on here something rather. But she managed to get herself a job in the house instead of the field. Looks to me like she does a lot more than just work around the house. You can say that again. There are different kinds of work, honey. But she's cool. She'll sneak stuff to me sometimes. Food, book, even nail polish. You know there ain't no luxuries in this plantation. But you can't hate a girl just because she got it easy. Let this serve as a lesson to all of you! That no one can escape Monteiro! No one! Even before the jungle can kill you. We shall find you and bring you back. Then you will wish that you had never left out. All dancing crocodiles had been to his swamp. This stupid girl thought she could escape. But as you can see, she's sadly mistaken. But we will make sure she does not repeat the same mistake. A more severe penalty await the other girl when she's caught. And she will be caught. It is only a matter of time. That man should better be glad it wasn't Sandy. Oh, Kelly, you realize Joyce is the girl Navarro was counting on. This Monteiro really knows how to make our life difficult. You haven't seen half of it yet. Wait till you see what happens to the guard who gave that girl the gun. You all know Ramon. He is the one responsible for the girl's escape. Senior Monteiro is not happy. So because of this man, lights out at nine o'clock. Only one meal a day for two months. Everyone in the fields at four o'clock every morning. No lunch break. If you show Senior Monteiro how displeased you are with this man, he will reconsider and give back your privileges. It's up to you. They're gonna kill him. This kind men. Somebody woulda help him. They'll kill you. Have you ever been right? Enough to know that fighting back is the surest way to get your head kicked in. Thinking all the work we do around here, they give us a little coffee. We're what you call minimum maintenance. I'm what you call sick of this slob. You wanna make a petition to make get a new cook? You mean to tell me somebody cooked this mess? And here comes dessert. Thought you might need some cigarettes. Oh, Serena, you're a fine rider. Yeah, I'm also a reckless fool. You know I could get my head bashed in for this? Oh, these are the new girls. Anggie and Kelly. Hello, welcome to the penitentiary. Hey Kelly, take a look at this. A house nigger. Be cool, girls. I have to go through a lot more than picking coffee beans, honey. A hell of a lot more. Yeah, but I don't think I have the stomach to do what you do. No, I don't think you do. Enjoy your lunch. You know, I kissed a lot of ass in my time, but I'm not gonna take non of her shit. This place is really getting in my nerves too. Well, let's bust out then. I wouldn't try it. Sandy's out there somewhere and she needs help. We'll leave tonight. How? You know what happens when somebody tries. I see what happens when somebody don't. What the hell do you think we're running here? A nursery school? But Senior Monteiro... Excuses, I don't need excuses. What I want is action. Results, positive results. But we've doubled the guards, Senior. Double the guards is nothing. Loyalty, discipline, fear. That's what you need among the ranks. Si, senior. It took you one whole week to catch one girl. Unforgivable. Si, senior. You have until this afternoon to bring me the other one. She will be caught, senior. If you bother, your next. Where have you been? Just riding. Sancho, what the hell are you doing here? Turko hit the camp. Killed some of our men. He's looking for you. Where's Sandra? She's not here. Get us outta here, Sancho. The men are ready. They're waiting at Pico de Loro, along the coast. Let's go. Now! Sancho! Oh no! You bastard, you fucking bastard! I'm gonna kill every last one of you. That man has gotta die. That's what all the girls talk about. Talk about killing Montiero and talk about escaping. You know, I must've heard 10,000 ways how to kill a man and another five how to get outta here. We can talk in our way, keeps us going. But pretty soon, all you wanna do is just stay alive. And you get on your knees and you crawl and you do anything they want you to do. I won't crawl on my knees for nobody. I'm not one of Monteiro's slaves. I was fighting for my life when I was five years old and I'm not rolling over and playing dead now. Anggie, there is no way out of here. Just no way. I'm gonna find it. You, time is up. Just tell your friends they better be extra careful. Monteiro has his eyes on them. You know how it works. Half the girls in this plantations would sell them their mother for a cigarette. I don't think they'd be stopping. Would you got with them? I might. You'd be killed. Is that an official statement? Marcie, you know me better than that. If I thought there was a chance I go with you, but there isn't. I know Monteiro better than anybody alive. No one has ever escaped from here. That's more important to him than anybody's life. You call this a life? I'm trying to make it as easy for you as I can. Serena, it ain't easy enough. I'll do this much. I'll see to it that they're released from their cells and they can work the fields gain. Gee, thanks. Marcie, at least they get a chance to eat a full meal. And the chance to think it over. But no more games. At least not until we get a definite plan mapped out. Is that a deal? The only deal I'm gonna make is to put a bullet through Monteiro's head. Now, Serena's only trying to help. There's not much difference between the frying pan and the fire. Take my word, stay away from her. Anggie, I've had enough of your bitching. And another thing, there ain't no house niggers around here either. So let's forget all that bull and see at how Serena can help us get us out of here. Fuck Serena. If only we can get a message to our men so they can come and blow this place sky high. My clients were very pleased with the last batch. All the credits goes to Serena. It would be a shame if you ever had to lose all these. I don't intend to. I blew the government has different ideas. You know, in the capital, I keep her all those lose talk about the justice department being anxious to see this closed down. Barrows, it will take much more than lose talk to do that. Much much more, my friend. It won't work. I don't care how many men they've got. Monteiro has this place so well-guarded, it would be suicide to try anything. Serena, they're gonna die here. I know that. Trust me. That's the best of the breed. Her. You know your women. Serena. Open your mouth. I'll get us outta here. Anggie, don't be stupid. Let me please, no! Leave me alone! Save me, please! No, please! Please take me with you! Please! Goddammit, leave me alone! No, no! I'm sorry for this. They'll have better manners next time. You see what happened, Anggie? I'm sorry, I didn't get to him. You'll be alright, Anggie. Serena! What do you want? Nothing. That can wait. What's the matter with you? Is it those black girls again? I'm fed up about you concerned over them. You've interceded for them once too often. You forget why you're here? No. Don't forget you're here because I need you. For my convenience. And I can do any damn thing that I want so stop meddling with my affairs. Remember that I own you and never forget where you came from or else. Then why don't you just let me go? You? Go? Up to this time, you're still hoping that I would change? That somehow, we could still make it together? Kelly, Kelly. I've decided. What? Beer. Oh, Anggie. When I get out of here, I'm gonna get a barrel of beer and I'm gonna get them, I'm gonna wallow 'em. That's the spirit, girl. Not spirit, beer. I'm gonna get outta here. I know what I need when I get outta here, girl. Wooh! Dancing? No, a good man. Can I have a piece? I'm just get out with them, Serena. I guess I haven't been fair getting you involved like this. But you got yourself put of the field and outta the barracks. You think that's the heel of a deal, huh? You know damn well what I go through. You think I wouldn't get out of this shit if I thought there was a way? Then help us. If there is a way, you are the only one who can find it. Marcie, it's not that I don't wanna help you. It's just that you'd stand a better chance if you went alone than if you went with me. Anybody else seem to follow them till they figured the jungle killed them. But me, Marcie, he's never gonna give up on me. Well, think about it, will you? Marcie, I've been thinking about it for years. You, you! Follow me, come on! I find you very troublesome, indeed. You never seem to be content with your life. If you was in our shoes, you'd understand why. You must be Kelly. Crossbone Kelly. You see, nothing ever escapes me. Nothing at all. Except me. I'm busting out of this, Monteiro. But before I do, I'm gonna put a bullet between your eyes. You resent me because of your sister's death, of course. But you must realize, she gave me no choice. She made me do it. Fuck you! I understand you were sent by the justice department to find out what happened with a contact here. But as you know, they have lost their contact here. She's been disconnected. At least, her neck was. I'm gonna kill all you! I'm sure you will if I let you. But I won't. Your gonna buffer my arms off, but I'll still find a way to kill you. Now, listen here and listen good. I'm sick and tired of all this business. I have no quarrel with you. So forget about your friend in the justice department because he's dead. Forget about your sister because she's dead too. And if you don't forget about escaping, you will be dead. Take them away! No food, no water, two days. Oh, Kelly. Get some water, get some water. Come on! Don't let the girls escape! The water. Marcie. Hold this up. Let's go. Away! And to think, the only thing I ever liked about the girl scouts is the boy scouts. You never know when you gonna learn something useful. I'm learning something useful. Like staying of jungle. I just hope we're the only ones in the jungle. Serena, throw that fire. You wanna know everybody where we are? Every time I move, I can't help think there's someone's following my thoughts. It's the jungle. It's got eyes. Everywhere you turn, there's eyes looking at you. Birds, animals. You ever have a cat? You can be sitting at home, doing something. Reading a book, then that cat comes in the room and he just sits there in the doorway staring at you. You know it. You feel it. I never feel like no cat's going drive me back to that plantation. Serena, are you sure we're headed to the coast? I'm sure. We're gonna have to take a rest. I'm too used to hopping in my car when I need to go some place. I don't suppose grandmother here would let us set the cap fire now. We don't need a fire. We just need to sleep. Or eat. You don't suppose you could kill an animal or something. The gorillas are close enough as it is. Oh, shit. I didn't bring a can't opener. Oh, that's terrific, Serena. You planned a hell of a picnic. We've got mosquitoes, we've got ants, we got no can opener. Listen, do you wanna go back? Serena, let me see one of the cans. Serena? Is this another one of Monteiro's tortures? Did he set you out here to starve us to death? Do you see her in anything? Dinner is served. Hey, Serena. Serena. Serena! Huh? Don't move. Just like every other snake I ever met. Can't leave my tits alone. This is gonna hurt. No more, I'm gonna die already. Just do it. Look at it this way, Marcie. It could've been worse. Snake would've crawl up your pants. Oh, please. Don't make me laugh. Just get some rest and you'll be as good as new. Kelly, that way. I swear someone's watching us. I feel it too, and it ain't owls. Hey! Kelly! Hey, listen, we got girls over there. We gotta get outta here. We did it! Come on! The captain's up ahead. Hey! Tell me what's going on? I want you to meet my fiends. That's Marcie and that's Serena back. They're gonna be friends, boys. Yeah. I'm so glad to see you again. Rocco. Come. Si. Now that amenities are over, may I ask you to put down your guns? Serena, of course, Turko deserves our gratitude as well. You low down bitch. You set us up! Drop the gun, Monteiro. Drop it! Go ahead, shoot! I dare you to shoot! Marcie, get Serena. Let's go! Vamos! Go ahead, Serena. Shoot me! Come on, Marcie. Hurry! Serena! Serena, for the last time! Come back here! Get outta here, Marcie. I'm not leaving you here, Serena. Come on! Magazine! Get back in the boat! Kelly, Turko! To the beach! Quick, cover the bridge! That's them, follow me! Get back, you guys. It's Turko! How the hell do we get out of this? I'll get Monteiro. Anggie! Rocco, get the boys ready. Marcie, get that gun ready! Come on, faster. Come on, Capitan, load that gun. Come on, come on, hurry. Steady as she goes. Hard right! Hold on tight! Rocco, tell the captain back to the beach. Capitan, back to the beach! At last we're free, never to go home. But we are home.
