For ages, the elders have told stories of how unique and remarkable our people are in the region. The women wear sarong and Sabai, dressed in local fabric. Any guest who visited would tell their friends that they'd like our women for their villages. -There are no women… -Bastards! -…who would be so gentle… -Damn it! -like the women from our village. -Funny, my ass, idiots! God damn it! My husband and my child, neither did what I wanted. It serves you right! Going out and dressing up like this. It's senior's day, we have to prepare for the ceremony, yet you still want to go out? But, Mom, everyone is going out. Don't argue with me. Go get the stuff ready. I'm going to Grandma's house. No, I'm not going. Why can't you go with Dad? Your dad too with his birds! I'm gonna cook them someday. Can't he just leave them be? I've had it with both of you. Hurry, go get the stuff. Are you gonna go at midnight? I'm so done with this. When this day comes around, I wish I could just get sick with diarrhea or puke so I could be admitted to hospital. Today is a great day, so is tomorrow and the day after. To be honest, going to pay our elders respect on the first day of new year isn't so bad. But for me, it's not just that. Here we go. It's about to start. Father, do you remember Prae? A flashback like I'm watching a movie being remade for a millionth time. Your skin is so bright, just like your father. The same old roles within this family. You grow up so fast. Such a bright skin, just like your father. Studying in Bangkok is like this. She's in an AC room all day, she doesn't go anywhere. You grow up so fast. Such a bright skin, just like your father. Studying in Bangkok… I don't understand these people. Why do they talk the same way every year? Go ahead, Prae. Prae is the daughter of Aunt Pa, whose husband is from Bangkok, and she only comes home once a year. Yet everyone always surrounds her and her mother. Pa's daughter, whose husband is from Bangkok. Look at her glowing skin. Truth be told, most of my grandparents' 'kids married someone from Bangkok or somewhere far away from here. They married a doctor, a teacher, or a public servant. They all have a future except her. The lottery number must be 89 this time. Blackjack! Sweet! Maybe 9995? I'm tired of this. Why didn't my mom marry someone from Bangkok like others? Sompoy, this is Mr. Supachoke. He works at a bank and he just moved here two months ago Mr. Supachoke, this is my friend, Sompoy. The one I told you about. Nice to meet you, Sompoy. You're so much cuter than I expected. Oh, I have something for you. Please wait. A beautiful flower… for a beautiful girl like you. If this isn't enough, you can have my heart too! Mr. Supachoke… Just call me Choke. Mr. Choke, would you… You can call me "baby" if you like. Phan, are you okay? She's not well. Hey, are you sick? I'm okay. You are sick. You just don't know it. Come here, friend. Come over here. -What is it, Som? -It's you! Where did you find this curly haired dude for me? Didn't you want someone from Bangkok? I did, but I didn't mean just anyone. I want someone handsome and cool. Not like I'll date just anyone from Bangkok! Som… Are you still going on about finding boyfriends from Bangkok? Well, I want it. If you want it so much, why don't you just move to Bangkok? Well, if I had money, I'd buy a ticket and go tomorrow! I'm so tired these days. All the dudes in our village are… I don't even know. -Calm down. -Quiet down. Som, aren't all guys the same? Why are you so worked up about this? Just date someone around here. Keaw, Kam, or Wian. -Just go get someone. -No, no. Go get them for yourself, dumbass. We all have goals in life, you know? Just being pretty is not enough. Look at Sis Weaw here. She's just working in a restaurant, but now she's got a western husband helping her out. I wasn't just sitting around, waiting for Micheal to just fall from the sky, you know? This is a man… Hello, Darling. …not some fish in the sea. This. This is what I want. I'm so tired of you. Sis… Is there no other way to help me? Actually, there is one. What is it? Everyone, come closer. Please place your donation for Pho Mon here. Is this the way you told us? Quiet down. Amen, amen. He's here. Go on, Sompoy. Ask what you want to know. Go ask Pho Mon. He knows everything. Go on. To the front, please. Please guide us. Pho Mon… the thing is I want a boyfriend from Bangkok. I want to know if my soulmate would be from Bangkok like I wish for. Pho Mon. Pho Mon. A Bangkok boyfriend, huh? Yes. -No. -What? No Bangkok boyfriend? No boyfriend at all. Your soulmate destiny is cut in half! Your ancestor ghosts are coming for you, do you know that? What are they coming for? For things you did when you were young, don't you remember? You did things without thinking! You disrespect them! You peed on them! Serves you right! No boyfriend for you! Woah, Pho Mon. Please be respectful. Pho Mon. Is there any way to help her? Maybe holy water? There is a way. But will she do it? What do I need to do? You need to wear our local dress. Wear local sarong for three months. To worship your ancestors, got it? Wearing local dress? Sis, I don't think this is it. Did you insult me? Disrespect. Disrespect. Do it or not, it's up to you. A stubborn person who listens to no one like you. I guess it's okay if no one wants you. Wearing local dress for three months? Sis, don't be stupid. You used to wear it to school every Friday. What's the deal now? He said it that much. If it was me, I'd run to buy local dress right now. Sompoy! Mom? What are you doing here? I should ask you the same thing. -Business. -What business? What a nuisance! -Stop asking, I'm in a hurry. -Mom! -What? -You see? Even your mom is here to see him. If you don't believe in this stuff then I can't help you, Som. -But, sis, I think… -Come on, Som. Do you think a medium is some sort of show? Don't think about it. Don't you want a Bangkok boyfriend? Come quick! You need to wear our local dress. Wear local sarong for three months. To worship your ancestors. -Sompoy! -Yes? Yes, my ass. I asked you to go buy my pickled tea leaves, and what are you still doing here? And look at this! All dressed up? You look like a crazy person. -I'm just a crazy person! -Som, are you okay? Hey, you want to leave your scooter here? I can drive you home. No, no need. I can go alone. You forgot your stuff, you know? You forget things, and then complain you lost them. Thanks, sis. Som, my dear friend, your scooter is not starting with a kick start. It is a button start. Be careful. -Som. -She's not even wearing a helmet. -You think she'll reach home? -I think so. She lives just right here. Mom -Yes, Mom? -Where did you go today? Many places today, but I still don't like them that much. -Don't forget to eat, okay? -I know, Mom. I'm a grown up now. Hold on, Mom. I can't hear you. Woah. Mom. I have to go. Shit! A ghost! Ghost, my ass! Why did you kick me? I just had a motorbike accident. -Oh. -What a stupid. You kicked me so hard. I'm sorry. Please get in my car. Watch out. Hey, are you sure leaving your scooter there is okay? Everyone knows each other around here. No one would steal anything. And did you hurt your head? Do you want to go to the hospital? My head hurts? Your head… Sun brand It's just my freshener, smell it. -Right? Right? -It's okay. I'm okay. Hey, tell me the way to your house then. -A tiny bird tells me to turn right. -Right? A crow tells me to… Yeah, right. Left or right? -Hey! Leave me! -Let go! Let go! Stay still! Lay down! Turn left! No, no, turn right! Hey, no! Is this the right way? Looks like we're going in a circle. Hey! Tell me the way first! Oh. This is the same place. Hello. One, two, three. Hello. This is the village chief. I have a message for Kampan on the north side. If you're looking for your own daughter Sompoy, well, stop looking. Come pick her up at my house. Someone left her here last night. Come over quick. I have to go to the fields. End of announcement. I wish us out of the woods and win the lotto. Amen. Amen. Handsome. So handsome. So freaking handsome. So damn hot. Sompoy! Seriously, you! Sis, where is he? You're back and now you're asking for a guy? Here. Take this. He said you forgot it in his car. What did you do in his car? Sis, and where is he now? How should I know? Probably still taking pictures at the temple? You guys haven't met before? You're up? Here, I got this for you. Gimme. Thank you so much. -I know what his name is. -What is it? Don't just get me hyped up. Hurry up, what is it? His name is Van, he's from Bangkok. Van, from Bangkok! Sis! He's from Bangkok. Bangkok! Looks kinda nice. He's here to take photos of Lanna culture. Looks like he likes our northern ways a lot. Let's go, Som. Go get dressed. See? I told you. Pho Mon is on point. Wearing local dress won't disappoint you. What, sis? You're wearing traditional dress. Don't just walk straight to a guy, -you have to be composed. -Composed? Have you seen it in the movies? When the guy and girl meet, it's usually some kind of coincidence. -And they'll remember each other. -Got it. Pretend to trip in front of him and say "ouch" out loud. And he'll turn to see you. He'll remember you. -Ouch? Like this? -Yes. No, no. It has to be this way. Ouch, the western way. Like a westerner. Ouch. That's good. But doesn't he like someone northern? Then you cry out the way a gentle northern girl would. How do you cry like that? Come on, is this the time for that? You have to be a sweet, slow-moving, gentle northern girl. Got it? Ouch! Are you okay? What do we do? Go get her. I'm sorry, so sorry. What's with you, Phan? Why did you drag me out? He was about to help me. Who told you to cry out like that? You told me to cry out in a gentle way. So I did. The way you did, all the monks here want to quit. Stop it! Stop. Let's focus. Focus. Let's say he didn't see you yet. -"Let's say"? -You startled me! And Som, you look so nice in this dress, but you are so not ladylike. Crying out like that, I'm surprised he didn't run away. -Really? Am I that obvious? -Very. What do I do? You guys did this to me. I know now… how you'll obtain the beautiful image of a northern girl. Are you guys sure to let me be the example? As beautiful as a Lanna woman. Khaotok, you are the only one in our village. That's too much. My mother told me that as women, we have to be modest, and make ourselves valuable. So people can see we're not only pretty on the outside. This much, really, sis? Look at her. You must be like her. This is for bedtime. It's so pretty. This one is for going to the temple. The pattern is modest, perfect for listening to the sermon and Dhamma. This one suits you. Mother. My daughter. -Everything you do makes me proud. -Thank you, Mother. The true descendant of Lanna people. All of our ancestors must be really proud of you. These are my friends. Hello, mother. Quick. Hello, mother. -Make yourselves at home. -Thank you. Your dresses are very northern, Khoatok. I don't think it's only the dresses. I thought I went to another dimension! Watch your mouth. You must be like her. You must find your own northern lady self. -That's difficult. -Really? All of this nonsense stuff? I'm serious. Van likes northern girls. The true Lanna lady, the original one. Not just any northern girl who cries like that. You cannot be like that. That's cheap, that's a no. I agree on this one. Why did you have to say that? I'm already not confident. What should I do? He's already seen me that way. Before you go home, stop by Pho Mon's place. Maybe he'll have some amulet or something for you. -Really? -Yeah. Trust me. PHO MON'S HOUSE Today is a good day for us to meet. I miss you all. I'll bless holy water, so you all can place it on top of your bed. In the morning, take a sip. In the late morning, take another sip. In the afternoon… Take it with liquor! When you performed at that place… Did you see that fat dude? He was praying and shaking. Son of a bitch. How could you do this? You shitface! Give me back my money! You're a scammer! Still wearing local dress? What are you laughing at? I heard everything you guys said up there. Really? Yeah. Wait and see. I'll tell all the villagers about you. You guys are done. Oh, hold on, what's your name again? Sompoy. Sompoy? Sompoy, your words and mine are on a whole different level. The dress is pretty, by the way. Just you wait! Son of a bitch! Damn it! Holy crap! I can't believe this is happening in our village! I don't believe it! Som, you sure you didn't make this up? Come on, sis. I saw and heard it myself. He pretended to have an old man's voice. And they cheered, split money and laughed. I was so pissed. You alone cannot do anything. There is no proof. The villagers won't believe you. Just wait. Wait until I get home, I'll burn this dress. Wait, isn't that your mom's dress? That's true. Hey, but this dress got you to meet Van. Right. You're right. At least it got me to meet Van. My soulmate. Right, soulmate. Where is your soulmate, by the way? Is he not here to take pictures? I've been waiting half a day. -Huh. -Right. It's hot. Damn it sis, how would I know? I've been waiting with you. Where is he today? How come we don't see him You girls are so dumb. Who would take pictures at the same place? Sis, if he doesn't come here today, where are we going to find him? Right. What do we do? Sis, you must help me. I found something. Van, the guy you're looking for has a fanpage. Are people watching this? There they are. Hello. Where am I? I'm on a road. I was going to take pictures at Pra Tat temple. But my car broke down. So, I can't go. But luckily, this young fellow is kind enough to help me. Let's go see. Here. Follow me. What is that? Is this smoke or mist? This is smoke, not mist. Let's ask him some questions. Hello. What's your name? -My name is Sab. -His name is Sab. -Somebody in here said you're handsome. -Really? Yeah. Here it is. So Sab, aside from being handsome, is also kind to help me. So today, he will take me to where I'm staying. If you wanna know where I'll travel next. Follow me on my page. Where he stays. Where he stays! Bitch! Sis, I know now how to find Van's place. Hey, who's there? Wait, Sompoy! How did you get in here? This won't end so easily, Sab. You won't stop messing with me, don't you, Sompoy? I've been working like this for 10 years now. Building trust and faith with the villagers. Do you know how long it takes to do that? If they really believed you, they'd have believed you a long time ago. -You're good at faking your voice. -Of course. Poor you, Sompoy. Don't waste your time on nonsense like this. I've been using this voice to make a living for so long. Good for you. Then keep this voice, so you can make a living in jail. Keep recording! -What? -I have the evidence now. Oh, what should we do now? Should we post it on a Facebook page? -Or on YouTube? -Do it! Or send this video to the police? Weren't you so confident? It's the end of a scammer's future! How is it? Aren't you good at faking your voice? Go on! Stop! Just kidding, we aren't that narrow-minded, you know? If you want this deleted, you must give us something in return, right? That's right. What do you want? Tell me now. Where is Van staying? Stop! So you all came here to see me, just for a guy? Shut up! He's staying at K.K. guesthouse! Hey, sis. Hold on. One, two, three. Are you here to book a room? Well, the thing is, I'm here for a guy named Van. He's from Bangkok, super handsome and he walks around with a camera. Van? Oh, someone took him to Bo Kok Wua at 5:00 a.m. this morning. Looks like he's taking pictures of the dawn or something. -Oh, perfect! Excuse me. -Yes. Thank you, you are so pretty. I'll buy you some snacks next time. See you. -I don't want any snacks. -What do you want then? I'd like you to follow, like, and share my TikTok. Oh, sure thing. Here we go. A tiny bird floating in the sky, a crow singing on the mountain. But this tiny bird is waiting, Longing for when you'll look at me. Oh, Van. Why did you recite a poem like that around here? If I don't speak our northern language, who will? Sompoy, you seem really proud of your northern ways. I'm really proud. I'm sorry. What did you just say? You seem proud of your northern ways. No, no, before that. Sompoy? You still remember my name? Why wouldn't I? Your friends were saying it so loudly at the temple the other day. I'm sorry, I wasn't so well back then. I wish we hadn't met that day. Well, what are you doing here? Sightseeing? I like getting some fresh air here once in a while. I never dreamt that I'd see you here. Actually, I'm here to take pictures for my Facebook page. The view is pretty here, so I want to get some pictures. That's right. The view is so pretty. Look, so pretty. -Look! A jumping fish! A jumping fish! -Where? Are you hot? Oh, sorry. Every time I come here, I bring sticky rice. These poor fish, not many things to eat around here. You seem like a kind-hearted person. Yes, I am. Sompoy! Your mom is looking for you. Why didn't you answer the phone? -Your mom bought something back home! -You two know each other? Yes. Sab suggested this place for me. Since you are from here, do you have any suggestions? Well, you can come take pictures near my house. My house is right next to the rice field with a mountain view. A rice field with mountain view, where you usually catch snakes and cook them? She likes to catch a lot of snakes. Snakes didn't do anything yet, but she'll just go around, catch them and cook them. Wait, you eat snakes too? Cheers! Cheers! Bastard! How long are you going to make me lose face? -What? What's with you? -What are you laughing at? Okay that's enough, I'll leave you alone. Now, delete the video. Why should I? If I delete it, what's to stop you from messing with me? What do you want from me? You already got to meet Van. Sab, you don't have power over me. So I'll tell you now, leave me and Van alone. Or else, I'll send the video to the police, and you guys will be screwed. I'm serious. -Hey. -Wait, wait. I'm not afraid of her. Oh, I drive? Let's go. Sompoy! Van! What for? Let me see. -Delete it. Not this, I don't look pretty. -Sompoy. I'm actually looking for a model to take pictures with tourist attractions I'll visit. Are you interested in being a model for me? Let me think for a second. Okay! -You sure? -Yes! Okay. Van! -Wanna see? -Yes. Sompoy! Poy! Sompoy! -Move to the left please. -All right. -Wanna see? -Yes. I'll leave this space for some wording. Oh, you take beautiful pictures. Sompoy! -Didn't think I'd see you here. -Khaotok. -You look beautiful in local dress. -Thank you. What are you doing here? I'm here to buy some fabric and pay respects to the monks. Are you here to pay respects to the monks, too? I'm here to be his model. -And Khaotok… -Oh, is this the guy -from Bangkok who loves northern culture? -Yes. My name is Khaotok. What's the name of a handsome guy like you? -Oh, I… -His name is Van. He's here to take pictures around our village. So I brought him here. We'll be going soon. Let's go, Van. I'll take you to take pictures of the Buddha's relic over there. It's beaut… Lanna's beauty is comparable with the beauty of northern women. Sompoy told me you like Lanna city, what about Lanna lady? Have you seen our village fingernail dance? Fingernail dance? Don't worry. I'll take Van by myself. -Let's go. -Right. -And this is the Buddha's… -Woah. Fingernail dance is a Lanna performance with a long history, inherited for many generations. The dance is gentle and graceful, the way Lanna people are. Are you interested in seeing my friends and me perform? I am. I want to take some pictures too. Let me borrow him for a day, Sompoy. I'll show him the way of a true Lanna lady. It's okay. I actually have to go practice my dance too. Oh, I didn't know you knew how to do fingernail dance. That's right. Sit. Beautiful. Now hands together beautifully. Stay there. Look up. Let's find a movement out of this position. And teach Dao too, she moves terribly. How can you call yourself a dancer? Let's practice again later. You can rest now. Wait, Sompoy. Where are you going? You need to practice more. You dance terribly. How's the hand? They're as stiff as a rock. You're a lady. Let me see. Like this. You're a dancer. Since we became friends, I've never seen you dance once. Now you're competing with Khaotok? You'll only lose. I know, but I don't know what to do. I was told to see her as an example. And what now? The example is taking my guy. What a bitch, that Khaotok. Sis, what do we do now? If we let it be this way, Van's going to fall in love with her. What do we do? Well, judging from the situation, there's only one thing left we can do. What now? Let's get some love potions. -Love potion? -Yeah. -Sis, don't talk nonsense. -Well… Hold on, both of you. I don't think that's appropriate. Hey, it's fine if you don't believe it, just don't insult the belief. In situations like this, we have to go all the way. First of all, you need to get a strand of hair from Van. -Van's hair? -Yes, Van's and yours. Oh, holy moly, sis. Oh, are you hurt? You have something on your hair. I saw it, Khaotok also took Van's hair. My gosh. Why didn't you tell me before? Khaotok is making love potions too. That's why Van keeps following her around. -Can you zoom in? -Zoom in? You two! Maybe it was just a coincidence. Don't think too much about it. Come on, you see the world too positively. People in the past used to put a strand of hair in a doll, wrap it with holy thread and keep it under their pillow. I can feel it. Khaotok must be doing that. You need to find and destroy it. -Khaotok, you bitch. -What a bitch. I'll go find it now. -Sit down, please. -Thank you. There's an old saying, to fix an enchantment by a girl, we'll need a guy without wife or kids. Sis, then what should I do? Well, is there any guy who can take you there? -Oops. -You deserve it! Where are you? Dumbass. Come here! Idiot, do you want to be seen? But she dances so beautifully. Beautiful, my ass. Be my lookout. Go! Under the pillow. Some people, when they see other people in love, they think it's enchantment. Look. Look at yourself. -Hey, hey. -What? Stop. Go watch the way. Don't forget to pray before bed, my daughter. Quick, hide! You're a good person, the Buddha will protect you. Yes, Mother. You, stop it. My mask. Oh, what is this? Why is this girl so northern? Whoa, shoot! Porno books? Are they still a thing now? X-rated stuff! Can I see? Oh. -I know now how to take care of Khaotok. -How? You take her picture with the porno book. -Me? -Yes. Get a clear picture. Okay, one… You dumbass! Hey. She's coming. Hide! Mother! Mother! Someone's here, mother! Mother, someone is in my room. Where? Where are they? Damn, the universe doesn't let me do a bad thing! Sab, I don't know what to do with you. You know, you're responsible for this. -Oh? -Don't oh me. It'd have ended if you weren't so stupid and flipped the camera. Khaotok is going to dance for Van tomorrow. Your job is to tell Van about Khaotok's sluttiness so he knows what I know. Don't you forget that I still have your video on my phone. Do what I say, understand? Sompoy wants to embarrass Khaotok in front of her audience? Yes. I'll take care of it. And what are you going to do? You see this? 500 grams of Viagra, the strongest slut pill. Takes effect in five minutes. Once she takes it, it will make her horny right away. I guarantee once she takes it, she'll moan… She will be so embarrassed. Awesome. How did you come up with this idea? You guys are brilliant. My true friends. Come on in, come help. -How did it go? -All done, my friend. -It's better this way. -Of course. But I don't know which one is Khaotok though. Right. But don't worry. I added the pill into the dancers' water. Khaotok will definitely drink from there. What? You added the pill in the water for all the dancers? Yeah, why? What's the problem? Shit! I'm screwed! How is it? Feeling nice? Nice? Nice? Huh? You and your dirty mind. I've helped you, and why are you still like this? This is the only way to embarrass her. Maybe there's a better way, don't you think? You were planning to do it to me instead, right? You? If I wanted to do it to you, then why did I drag you out? You bastard. I only have this. Feel free to walk home all wet if you want. What's up, Sab? What are you doing here today? Your dad was at my house, he's been drunk since morning. Poor dad. Wait. One, two, three. Watch his head. Slowly. Okay, lie down. -Dad, take it slow. -Dad. Watch out. If he sobers up, tell him not go to grandpa's house again. He's a mess. Auntie, how can a drunk person know that? It's been too many times. It causes me trouble, you know? Ane if he still does this next time… I'll throw him out on the road. I won't even bring him back here. He probably misses his siblings. Look at him. Who'd want to be his siblings? I'm telling you. Don't go to that house again. Let's go home, Eak. Grandpa is waiting for dinner. I'm going now. Take care of your dad. -See you. -Bye. Hey, why are you so sad? Go home, I'll take you there. Was that your cousin? No, my driver. Oh, come on. Don't mind him. My dad's just pretending. You just don't know it. Right, dad? My dad is an old tiger, the best in my village. -Hey. -What? Normally, he gets drunk all the time. It's nothing serious. -Not that. -What? It's your dad. His head just went into the shrine! Dad! Hello, Sab. The helmet. Jerk. Yes. I'll be going. Bastard, just go. Why did you disappear like that? I was so worried. I had a terrible headache in the morning, so Sab took me to the hospital. I'm sorry I didn't let you know first. Are you okay now? Feeling better? After taking medicine, I'm feeling much better now. -It's too bad. -I feel very bad too. Very bad? No, not like that. I'm just disappointed that I didn't get to dance for you. I don't mean that. What do you mean? I thought when you finish dancing, we could go on a ride somewhere together. But you're sick, so I'm afraid we can't do that. If so, how about tomorrow or thereon? Tomorrow or thereon? It means the day after tomorrow. If it's the day after tomorrow, I think it'd be really great. It means it would be very good. It must be. So, see you on the day after tomorrow, I'll pick you up with my motorbike… Oh, it's too hot. My head's hurting again. I'm going then. So pretentious! -Where have you been, Khaotok? -Who's that? -Khaotok? Khaotok? -Oh, these bastards. -Khaotok? -Leave my kid alone, go. -Khaotok? -I'll take care of this. Get inside. DO NOT DISTURB! -Khaotok. -Bastards. What is it? -I'm still not satisfied. -Go away! -Come out and let me see. -Not backing down? Go away! You bastard! If I see your faces again, I'll kill you! -Poor her. -Yeah. Was it that bad? It's good that you didn't perform with them yesterday. What happened? -Look. -Look at it. Here. -Don't pull my pants! -Hey, you! Let me go! Want to delete it yourself? Did you make a copy somewhere? What do you think of me? Well it's okay, because if you post my video, I'll tell everyone in the village about the Viagra incident yesterday. It's over. Damn it. The mission is already accomplished. Even though he got me in some trouble, it's okay. Because of that incident, it makes me realize how much Van worries about me. You know, tomorrow he'll take me out on a motorbike. Well, since you're here, taste this. Hey. -Want sticky rice? -You got some? -Of course. -Bring it. Your favorite, huh? Delicious. By the way, you really like Van that much? Well, he's handsome and he's also from Bangkok. What does it have to do with Bangkok? Dating someone from Bangkok is really good, you know. Think about it. If I marry him, I'd have to move to Bangkok. I'll only come home sometimes. Now, people would surround me, asking about how it is in Bangkok. "Look at her skin, bright and shiny like a rich woman" Most importantly, they'd get jealous because he is so handsome. It's true he's good-looking, and almost perfect in every way. But is he going to like a local woman who eats raw meat like you? Hey, I'm done eating. I'm just kidding. It's delicious, you know? -Just kidding. -Damn you. Here, one each. You don't know me. Come at me. I can stay till tomorrow. Here's some more. -Let's drink! -Drink again? Stop, stop. Let's stop. How can we stop? If you don't drink, I'll feed it to you. Whose kid are you? I don't know. I only know that I'm pretty. You don't know me? I'm the best in this village. Thank you, Sompoy. I got a lot of pictures today. You're welcome. Do you still want to go to Bangkok? I do. I still have to travel to many provinces this year. And I still want a model for those tourist attractions. So I don't know if you still want to go with me. It's okay if you don't want to go. I'm just asking. -It's not like that. I can go anywhere. -Anywhere? -Oops. -Watch out. When I know the exact date, I'll let you know. So we can prepare. Okay. -I'll go now then. -Okay. -Drive safe. -Good night, Van. Sompoy. You've been gone. You didn't come to practice the other day. Didn't you dress for it too? I had a headache, so I went home. Is that so? I was wondering where you were. Didn't you put Viagra in my drink? Khaotok, calm down. Calm down, my ass. You know what you did. Stop pretending like you don't know. You see? I can't wear local dress properly anymore. When I try to speak slowly, it isn't the same anymore. My mom lost her mind because of you, Sompoy! Where are you going, bitch? Khaotok. Sompoy, a beautiful Lanna lady. Let me tell you something. When you're shit, you're shit. You may pretend that you're gold, but people who like gold will never want you. Ouch, Khaotok. Khaotok. Khaotok, you slapped me? You slapped me? Sompoy! Van! Sompoy slapped me. The other day also she snuck Viagra into the dancers' water. How could you do this, Sompoy? You have to go this far for a guy? Van? Hey, I'm afraid that he doesn't want me anymore. Sompoy, calm down. He probably doesn't think about it that way. But I can tell by the way he looked at me. If he really loves you, then he'll accept who you are. Don't worry. Who would love a woman like me? A woman like you is the loveliest. You don't have to say things to make me feel better. I know who I am. Here, eat some porridge. Hey, let's go somewhere, okay? Come on, get up, quick. What are you waiting for? Come! Oh, Bua Kieng. I'm so happy you could come. Let's have a drink to our friendship. -I haven't seen you for a while. -Uh… no. Just a little, Bua Kieng. Go on, drink. "Bua Kieng"? -Do I have to? -Yes, everyone does. There. Bua Kieng probably forgot all about us. Drink with us, Bua Kieng. Come on, come on. -Drink. Cheers. -All right. I'm Bua Kieng then. -One more, one more. -That's it. No more. No. -Pour more, more. -Come on, Kieng! More! -If we're not drunk, we'll drink more! -Drink up! Drink up, drink up. Hey, you wait here, I'll be right back. -Drink up. Drink up. Drink, drink! -Drink up. -Drink all the way! -Cheers! Geckos How are you, Bua Kieng? Bua Kieng, my ass. If you like it, I can bring you back next time. God, no. Don't. Having that much fun, you must feel better now. -Hey. -Huh? I'm tired. Look at me now. How can I be this bad? I think you think too much. Why are you not like Van? What? What is it about Van? If you are like Van, you can take me away from here, take me to Bangkok. I'm tired of this place. I don't want to be here. And if I take the Bangkok part out and ask you, would you date me? What are you talking about? I'm serious. If I ask you, would you date me? Sompoy. Don't say this when you have no feelings for me. Can you pick me up tomorrow for more raw meat? Hey, wait. Let's talk. Raw meat, and then what? That's it. You tricked her into loving you, but don't really want her. You asked her to see you, but you don't really care. It's not just that. Hey, I don't want to ask much, but which day are you picking her up? Don't know. Oh. Where are you going? -Come talk to us. -Well… -Hey. -What? What's up? Can you help me make the raw meat dish tomorrow? -That's more like it! -This is the way, my friend. My bro is gonna have a girlfriend! Sompoy, someone's here for you. Van. Thank you. Not even a little? Van. I think you should go back. What's wrong, Sompoy? I really want to apologize to you, I've been lying the whole time. Actually, I'm not a polite or soft-spoken person. I don't like wearing local dress everyday. I'm really sorry that I'm not someone you think I am. You think I really don't know who you are? Really? You knew the whole time that I faked it? I knew since the day you got in my car drunk. Actually I don't mind that you pretended to be a sweet, polite girl who wears local dress. I like you the way you are. You're cute. Sompoy, I like you. I asked you to go on a trip and take pictures with me, right? I don't know if you feel the same way I do. Van. Do you still want to be my model? What's wrong with you? Isn't it good that a nice guy wants to be your boyfriend? What are you waiting for? Seeing you this way makes me tired. How about this? Come with me tomorrow. Where? You will find out tomorrow. Make merits, do good deeds. So that things will get better. Food offering to me. I want fresh food. Fresh fruits. Trust me, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say anything. Mom! Could you help us one more time? Who is this? Pho Mon. Now that my daughter has a boyfriend from Bangkok. Ever since they're together, she looks very depressed. She looks sad, it's hard to explain. Could you please see if these two are soulmates? Like, will they get married? Pho Mon. This is your kid? Yes, her name is Sompoy. A northerner and a Bangkokian. Pho Mon, is it going to be good? Are they soulmates? Yes. -They are? -They are. Their destiny is aligned. Listen, listen. Being together. Being together will bring them forward. I'm so glad! Anything they do will grow fruitful. Only good things will come. Are you happy? If they get married and live together, they will grow old together. Don't you forget about the food offering for me. Tomorrow, I'll get you holy water. Bring all your children and grandchildren. What did you say just now? What are you talking about? When you pretended to be a medium. Medium? Maan, what did Pho Mon say? What did Pho Mon say to you? Okay, it's okay. Hey, he's been waiting since morning. You should've gone down and got him some water. Don't take too long. -Hey, Sab, have you heard? -What? -Sompoy is going to Bangkok. -Yeah. Sab. Don't you have work to do? Many people will come to see Pho Mon today. Don't you have stuff to prepare? Take care then. Call me when you get there. Just let her go. People like us have to know our place. I think you did the right thing. We stay in our place. A lot of villagers come to see you. Idiot. They don't come here to see him, they're here for Pho Mon. How many people would actually come here to see him? Please take care of her. Of course, mother. I'll take care of Sompoy. Stop fighting each other. Okay, Mom? Pho Mon? Mom, I have to go. Bye. Bye, dad. Sompoy, let's go. Have a safe journey. Sompoy, I've sent you pictures that we took. Have you saved them yet? I have. Then, choose the ones you like and I'll retouch them later. So we can post them. Okay. I think people will like them a lot. You look so lovely. When we're done with the north, how about we go to the northeast? I'm thinking about going to Nong Khai and three more provinces. Sompoy, do you want to go? Sompoy! Van, stop! Sompoy! Hey, not now! Bro, I'm here to help you! The brake, the brake! Move away, move away! Hey, Sab! Keaw! Get in the car! Maan! Maan, you're awesome! Sompoy! -Stop the car! -Drive faster! Sompoy! I'm here! Stop the car! Stop the car! Maan, the engine is off! Sompoy! Start the engine now! -Drive faster! -Bro, the engine's off! Start it again! Bro, try using the microphone! Sompoy! Sompoy! I love you! Can you hear me? I love you! I love you! Idiot! I heard you! You didn't have to call me that many times! Hello! Hello everyone, everywhere, nearby and far away! It's us again, Sompoy and Weaw. On Sompoy's channel. Today, we're going to review our local dish. What we need is Weaw's chilli paste here. Sure thing, we also have this from Weaw also. Made fresh and clean. Reasonable price at 30 Baht each. There's also Weaw's fish sauce. And Weaw's MSG. Sis, we're not doing that today. All right, I just want to sell some stuff. What we really need for this dish is buffalo meat. Sis, buffalo meat. We don't have it. -Buffalo meat. I didn't buy it. -What? You didn't buy it? That's okay, because we have…Sabman! Sabman is here! Here's some fresh buffalo meat. Delivering everything to everywhere except my heart. Because I already have a girlfriend. Call now for this service. -As quick as a monkey… -Sab Delivery. And I thought I could sell some stuff. But it's my channel! So annoying, I'm going. I miss you.
