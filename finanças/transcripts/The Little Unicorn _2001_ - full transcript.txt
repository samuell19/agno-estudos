- Polly, at last. Polly, come on. - Hi Auntie. - Polly! - Are you alright? - No, my knee hurts. - I'm sorry, Pol. It was an accident. - Excuse me. - Ow! - Sorry. - You will be Toby Cooper, out of the way. Ooh, that's a nasty graze. Can you walk? - Yes. - Come on then. There ya go. Alright, the fun's over. Are you sure you're alright? - Polly, your bag. I'm really sorry. - Go on. If these states schools... You shouldn't have to put up with this. - Oh, don't start that again. Aunt, please, I'm happy here. - Yes, well, you'll be even happier at St. Jude's. They get the best people and the best college places and there are no boys. - But it's a boarding school in town. How will I help Granddad look after the farm? - I'm sure Granddad can look after the farm by himself. - Well, I'm not going. - We'll see. - Hi Granddad. - Hi Polly. - How's Belle? - She's fine, Pol. - I think she'll fall tonight. - Hi Belle. - Here give her this. - Hello Dad. - Lucy. - Hello Sam. - How do you do? - I can't stop, I'm running late. I'll try to pick her up again tomorrow but I have a 2 o'clock so I may not make it. I'll give you a call. - If you need me later, I'll be on my mobile. - Right. Thanks Sam. What have you done to your knee? - Oh, nothing. It's just a scratch. - Let's go inside and have a look at it. - I can't wait to get out of these school clothes. Belle? Don't be frightened, Belle. I'm here. It's only thunder. Belle? Easy, Belle. Steady, girl. Come on, Belle, stand up. Please, you must stand up. Oh no. Granddad! Granddad! Granddad! - Polly? What's wrong? - It's Belle. - Hello? Right, Ted. I'm on my way. Oh, and tell Polly not to worry. See ya soon. I'm sorry Pol but Belle's dying. To save her foal, I'll have to operate. - No! - He has to. She's old. She can't take the strain. It would be unfair to expect her to. - No. - Do the best you can, Sam. - She won't suffer. I promise. - Come here. - Do horses go to heaven? I'm sure they do. I expect they have their own heaven, full of green fields and clear flowing streams and on a hill overlooking it all, a pure white unicorn who's job it is to keep all horses safe. - Will Belle go there? - Of course she will. - Will the unicorn look after her? - Yes. - I wish. I wish. I wish I had a unicorn here so we could make Belle better. I wish it would come and save her. - Granddad. - Oh my goodness. - She's gone, Pol. I'm sorry. - No. - The foal? What about the foal? - I don't believe it. Look Pol. - You're too late, too late. You let Belle die. - Give us a whiskey. Make it a double. Thank you. Another. - Steady, Sam. You alright? You look like you seen a ghost. Well maybe I have. If it weren't a ghost, the weirdest thing I've ever seen. - If you keep downing them whiskeys, ain't the last thing you gonna see either. - You can knock, Ned but whiskey or not, I saw a unicorn tonight and it was as real as I stood here. That's alright. You can laugh but I'm telling ya, young Polly Evan's mare just gave birth to a unicorn. - Birth. - Darndest thing. Lightning struck the stable, moment Belle died and there it was, silver dust falling off. And it's horn, pink as peach crystal. - And then the fairies came and mended the roof and served fish and chips. - I don't give a damn what you fools think but I know what I saw. - Polly? It was all for the best, Pol. Belle was ill and she was old. - I know. - There's someone else who needs a hug. It's not the foal's fault. It just lost it's mom. - I know. - Come on. - I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. I didn't mean to be mad at you. You are magic! - I don't believe it. - Granddaddy, he really is magic. - Mr. Regan? - Yes? - Jim, Jim Preston. I'm a reporter with the Queen Bee Herald. - Ted Regan. - Ted, nice to meet you. It's a grand farm you have here. I thought I would just pop around and see I couldn't put paid to some of these rumors. - Rumors, what rumors? - The stories of cruelty, mistreatment and horses dying in the night. - Who the hell are you and what do you want? - Calm down. I ain't saying there any truth to the rumors. Personally I think it's all a pack of lies. You don't look the type of man who go around mistreating anything, let alone horses. - Where did you hear I mistreated horses? - Ol' Sam was in the pub last night, not that I'm blaming Sam but probably the drink talking, but he did say you had a sick mare die last night and he was concerned for the foal. - Well, the mare died of natural causes. The foal's doing well. - Look, you know that and I know that but how are we going convince everyone else? Now if I was to see the foal, I could let everyone else know. - I suppose it'll be alright. - Unbelievable. - Boss. Boss. Boss. - Now, look we're... - Boss. - You have to trust me. - Come on Tiny, we've haven't been paid in weeks. - And you think I have? - Boss. - You think I'm any better off than the rest of you? - Yeah, I need my money. - Have I ever put myself before the welfare of this group? I'm asking you, have I? - Boss! Boss. - What? Mighty, what is it? - Look boss, look at this. A real live, honest-to-goodness unicorn. - I don't believe it. Mighty, you're a genius. Now friends, listen to me, hear me out. No no, come on, come on. I got the answer to all our problems. - Oh yeah, I've heard that before. - Honey, I'm doing the best I can. What else can I do? - Just cut the bull, Tiny, and get to the point. - The point? The point is this, look. A unicorn, a real live unicorn. Can you imagine what people would pay to see this? Can you imagine how big of a crowd we can get in that big top to see this? Think about the money we could earn. We can make a fortune. - Maisie? Maisie, how ya going? Oh, not very ladylike. Chewing gum, slouched in the chair, reading a newspaper. I don't understand. - Calm down, Henry dear. - Don't call me Henry, the name's Allonso and I want you to address me as Allonso. - You gotta read this, Henry. It's about a unicorn. Are you listening to me? - Of course, I am listening to you. How much of a hoax unicorn. Did you say a... Nonsense. Hoax. - And why does it have to be a hoax? - Because a unicorn is a hoax. - Why? You're a magician. Don't you believe in magic? - Not anymore. I do tricks, lousy little tricks. - Now you do but what if it was for real? Think what you could do if you had it's horn. You could be a real magician, doing real magic just like you always dreamed. - My darling little Maisie. Dreams are for fools. There is no magic and it is a hoax. We should prove it. - Whatever. - You sure this is the right place? - I guess it must be. They're never going to let us in there. - Good morning missy. Now, now, now, get back, get back. That's a good gentleman. You haven't been invited. - Come on, I'm a friend of Ted's. - Just going to have to find another way to get in. That's all. Come on. - What on earth is going on? - Have a look at this. - Who are all these people? This is a joke. - No, let's go inside. - Where are ya? - Shh, shh. I can not reach, shove. Aah! - Mommy. - That's a strange fellow. Well, come on, Penny dear. - You okay, boss? - Any sign of the beast? - No. Let's try up here. - Mom. - Shh. - Shh. - Get it. - I promise it's true. - Dad, it's impossible. Unicorns don't exist. The foal's deformed or something, that's all. - You saw the graze on Polly's knee. It just disappeared. - Well, kids heal fast and it wasn't that bad in the first place. Oh, Pol. - Oh, Aunt Lucy. Belle died, she died. - I know but she was very old and well, these things happen, don't they? - That's quite a crowd outside, Pol. - Yes, we need to get this nonsense sorted out. - It's not nonsense. Belle's foal is an unicorn. He cured my knee. - Polly, don't you think you're a little bit too old to believe these silly stories? - It's not a story, it's the truth. - Mommy, what's we doing? - What do you think we're doing? If ol' Tate won't let us in to see the foal, we'll find another way. - But isn't that trespassing? - A little trespass won't hurt. Besides, we've got to find out if this unicorn is real. If it is, it'll be worth a fortune, that stud. - But Mr. Regan doesn't run a stud farm. He keeps sheep. - No, but we do. - Now, come along. - It's true. He's beautiful. I am going to make so much money. - Shhh. - There it is, look at it. It's real, it's really real. It's got a horn and all. - Yeah, it's cute but how you gonna get that in the back of a mini van. - I'm not. I only need it's horn, remember? - What? - Shh. - What is it? - Did you hear anything? - No, I didn't hear a thing. - How you gonna get it to stand still long enough for you to steal it's horn? - I dunno. I'll hypnotize it. Yes, that's what I'll do. - That'll never work. - Oh no? Watch this. Oh, that's not it. Yeah, yes. Right, there it is. I never get it to work the first time. Wait, here, I have the magic birthstone. Ah, there you are. Look at that. Look deep into the depths of the crystal. Listen to my words. Your eyes are getting sleepier and sleepier. Tireder and tireder. Stare into the crystal. Your eyes are sleepier and sleepier - Stop pushing. - Go to sleep. Sleep, sleep. - He's hypnotized the wrong one. - Close your eyes and drift off. Sleepier and sleepier. Tireder and tireder. - Boss? Boss? - What's going on? - Maisie! - No, Penny! - Quick, this way. - Oh, oh, oh No, no people. Get out, get back. - Come on, this way. Hurry, hurry. - Stay back. Keep off my land. - Wait. - Come on, Maisie. Come on, snap out of it. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Watch the birdie, never worked in the act before. - Come on, boss. - Come back, come back. - Oh Dad, you've really done it now. - What have I done except care for my granddaughter? Your sister would turn in her grave if she thought you were sending her only child away. - I'm not sending her away. I'm doing what I think is best for her. And boarding school will broaden her horizons, make a young lady out of her. Look, I'm her guardian too and this little fiasco isn't helping your case at all. Sid, come with me. We'll head them off at Parmers Lane. - Aah! Are you alright? Toby? - What? What happened? - Here, sit up here. - You. - Relax, sit still. It wasn't his fault. You were going too fast. - You see anything? Well, we're going to have to split up. - Oh no, they're coming. - What's going on? - They're after us. Well, after him. - He looks like a unicorn. - I know that, he is a unicorn. - What's his name? - He hasn't gotten one. I mean, I haven't given him one yet. - Polly, where are ya? - Come, quick. - Don't be afraid. - Come on, we better hide. - They're around here somewhere. My paper's offering a 1000 pound reward to the people who catches the unicorn. - Quick. - Oh no. - Spike, Spike! - Spike? - Well, I don't know. We have to call him something. - Spike, Spike! - Oh no, wait here. Come on, we better go, quick. Quick Spike, follow us. - Come on, Spike. - There they go. Come on, Spike! - Faster, Spike! - Come on. - Look out! - Oh. - Come on. - Are you alright? - Come on, come on. - Ah, idiot! - Stop it. - Granddad! - Toby, Polly. - Help, they're still chasing us, Granddad. - Oh Maisie, you're back, you're back. - Sid, show these people out and don't let anyone else in. Toby, do me a favor and get... - Spike! - Spike, back into his stall. Polly, into the house. - Dad! - Polly, come here. - Everybody out. - Come on in, Spike. - Move over, let's go. Come on, out of here. Everybody out. - Come on, Spike. - Alright, I've had enough of this nonsense. You're going to St. Jude's and that's that. - But. - No buts. I could have killed you just now. - Lucy. - No, Dad. I know you've tried to do what's right for Polly but you're not getting any younger and Polly's at a time in her life where she needs friends her own age. - St. Jude's is on the other side of the county. - And she can come home for school holidays. - I don't know. - Dad, you can't take care of her by yourself. That's settled then. - No! Granddad. - I think it's for the best, Pol. - I'll make the arrangements. Cheer up, Polly. You're really will enjoy it. - I don't want to go. - Now, listen to Lucy, Pol. I'm sure you'll enjoy it when you get there. - No, I won't! - What's wrong? - Oh nothing, I'm just being sent to boarding school, Belle's dead and no one will leave Granddad and Spike alone. - I'm sorry about Belle. Maybe boarding school won't be such a bad idea. - Oh sure, you'd just love it. - That's not what I meant. - Who's going to look after Granddad? And what about all those people who were after Spike? - I got an idea. - What? - Come on. - Come on, Spike, come on. This is never going to work. - Well, I don't know. Most folks see what they wanna see and Bonnie don't mind, do you, Bonnie? There we go. What do you think? - He doesn't look a thing like Spike. He'll never fool anyone. - Hmm, maybe Spike can help. - What do you mean? - Well, he's magic, isn't he? Brilliant. No one's looking. Get Bonnie ready. - It's a unicorn. It's out. - What? Penny, come here. - It's out. - Oh. Folks, folks, you can't come in yet. No, nope. - Penny, come on. Stop pushing me. Just stop. - Everybody out. - Catch him, hold him, hold him. - What's happening now? - I'm sorry Ted, they just swarmed in. - What's going on? - So, what's going on or what's coming off? This, it's a hoax. It's nothing but a hoax. I bet you think you're so damn clever. Been laughing at us all. Well, you'll rue the day you crossed me. - No, now, you just calm down, sir. - Calm down? Don't you tell me to calm down. He's made a laughing stock out of us all. This is the biggest hoax since the Piltdown man. Just think of it. - It worked. - Yeah, we did it. - Yeah. - The old rogue, I didn't think he had it in him. - What's that, boss? - This, take a look. - Grab the end of pole, boss. - A hoax? - Yeah. - I don't believe it. - Neither do I. It seems that everybody else does which means the heat is off and we have a free hand. - But how are we suppose to steal a unicorn, boss? They don't exactly grow on trees. - Well, according to this, they don't exist at all and if they don't exist at all, then we can't steal 'em. Or at least we can't be accused of stealing something that didn't exist in the first place. It's brilliant. - Aah! Boss! Boss, help! - A hoax? Ted Regan must be stupid if he thinks he can fool me that easily. - Well, maybe it was a hoax. - Penny darling, don't be stupid. Even you could tell that these two horses look nothing like each other. This one is a Golden with a stick stuck to it's head. And that one is a unicorn. Is that clear? Huh? - Hi. Where's Polly? - Saying goodbye to Spike. - Will you go and tell her it's time to go? - Okay. - Take care of Granddad for me and make sure you stay out of sight. You know I wouldn't leave you if I had a choice but Aunt Lucy's determined. What am I going to do? I won't know anyone. - Polly? Your aunt said it's time to go. - Bye Spike. - Don't worry, I'll look after him for you. - Thanks Toby. - All set. Come on, cheer up. You'll love it when you get there, won't she, Sid? - Of course you will. - I've packed some of your favorite things. - Thanks. - Oh, come on now. You'll be back home in a few weeks for the holidays. Aunt Lucy's right, you'll have a great time. You'll make a lot of new friends. - I love you, Granddad. - I love you too, Pol. I'll miss you. Go on, give 'em hell. - Bye Pol. - Bye Toby. - Don't worry about Spike. I'll take good care of him for you. - Thanks Toby, see you. - Bye-bye. - Bye Granddad. - If this is a hoax, what are we doing here? - This is not an hoax. - Oh! - You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Oh, Polly. You'll be alright, won't you? - Don't worry, we'll take good care of her. - Well, we better make a move. Bye Pol. You stay out of trouble, okay? It'll be okay. - Bye Polly. I'll give you a ring later and make sure you're settling alright. - Mommy! Turn the lights on. - Shh. - Henry! What did you do that for? - Come on. - What's going on? - Something happening. Come on. - Wait for me. - Come on, come on. - You can't just open the door and leave me. - This way, over here. - What the heck is going on? Where we going? - Quiet. - Where's the dog, Mommy? - Oh, shut up. - Slow down. Slow down. Wow! Slow down! - Can't. - Watch it, watch it. - The brakes are gone. - Oh great. - Whose driving this thing? - Get your hands on the wheel! - I know what I'm doing. - Watch it, watch it. - It's not working. - Watch out for the bridge. There's a bridge. Wow! - That was close. Are you alright? - This is great, just great. This is all that I needed. - Yes, but you see, I thought the brake was on the left but it wasn't, was it? You see, the gear stick, that's what did it. It was the gear stick. When I took that left swerve, it moved. I saw it jump. - Now what? - We're gonna follow them. - Follow them? - Yes, we're going follow them but first follow me. - Shh, come on. - Where are we suppose to be going? Slow down, your legs are longer than mine. I'm fed up, I'm hungry, and I didn't want to come on this wild ghost chase anyway. - Will you stop complaining! - Turn the lights on, Mommy. - Look out! - You alright? - I think so. - Oh no. - Come on. This is perfect. I think this one is going to be okay. - She's fine. It can't be. - I think it is. - This side, I can't reach. - Is he okay? - Yeah. - Come on, let's get him out. - Come on, faster, faster. Look, hurry Henry. You're losing him. Hurry. - Come on, we don't have all night! Come on! Get it out, get it out. - Oh boy. - Leg it. - It's all your doing, Henry. I've broken a nail. - Shut up and stop calling me Henry. - Wow! - What are you doing in the water? Can you get me off this? - You help yourself, Henry! I've had enough. - Stop. - Wow. - Spike! Spike, boy. Spike? Spike! Ted! Ted! Ted. He's gone, Spike's gone. - I don't know, Ted. The lock's been broken right enough. There's lorry tracks in the mud. Whoever took that horse is long gone. - But we have to find him. There aren't any other unicorns around. He'll stand out like a sore thumb. - Unicorn? I thought all that was a hoax. - You make me to put a APB out for a unicorn? - You're right, Sid. I don't want to go through all that again. Look, do the best you can but keep it low key. Lucy'll kill me if there are any more fuss. - I'll do the best that I can. Tell Lucy I'll pop by tomorrow. - You're trying to impress my daughter, would you, Sid? - Well, if he won't help us, I guess we'll just have to find Spike on our own. - I think we should leave it to the police. - We can't. You heard what he said. He isn't going to help us. - Sid knows what he's doing. - Great. You're as bad as the rest of them. - Toby! Toby, come back. Toby! - Look at him. He's gorgeous, yeah? - He's a bit wild, boss. Someone is going to get hurt if he keeps on acting like this. - Right. He's the only one that's going to get hurt if he doesn't mind his manners. - Polly. - What, Toby? - Shh. - Come on to bed. Sweet dreams, Sarah. - What are you doing here? - Spike has been stolen. - Stolen? How would? When? - Last week. - Last week? What didn't you tell me? - I'm telling you now. You know how long it's taken to get you? - You could've found, I've never found him now. - You don't have to. I know where he is. He's joined the circus. - Come on. - What's happened? - Polly's run away. - What do you mean run away? She can't have. - I'm afraid she has. The school called me. They wanted me to see if she come here. - Oh my. - Toby's missing too. - Toby? Well, that's it then. It's this unicorn nonsense. They're in it together. - Nonsense? Anything that isn't about money or position is nonsense to you. - Dad! - Don't Dad me. This is your fault, all of it. Honestly, I did play my part in it but you pushed her and pushed her and I gave in and we sent her away to that wretched school. I knew she was unhappy. I kept my mouth shut and see what it's done to us. - Ted. - You stay out of this, Sid. You're not my son-in-law yet. - Where you going? - To get my granddaughter back. - I was just doing what I thought was best. - I know. I know. And so does your dad. He's just upset. - Thank you. - One please. - Come on. - Okay, okay. - I think we're going to make a fortune. - If we can get the animal to perform. - He'll perform. One way or the other, he'll perform. - We'll see. - How we gonna find the unicorn, let alone steal it's horn? - Shh. - Don't you tell me to shh. Henry! - Come on. - Henry! - What they doing to the poor thing? - Well well, my boy. We're not so frisky now, are we? Hmm? I have got myself a big top full of paying customers out there and if you know what's good for you, you will put on a good show. Won't you? I thought so. Get him out of here. - Come on, go on. Yeah, that a boy. Go on, come on. - Come along then. - Look at all those people. - They're all here to see Spike. - I don't know how people can be so cruel. - They're not. At least not most of them. They're here to enjoy the circus. They don't see what the animals go through behind the scenes. - Then they should open their eyes. - Wait for me. - How are we going to find Spike? - Don't worry, we'll find him. Come on. The animal cage is over there. Come on. - Aah! - Shh! Are you alright? - It smells awful. Aw, the poor things. We have to find Spike. - I don't think he's here. - They'll kill Spike if they train him like this. - They won't want to. Not as long as they're making money. - We'll soon put a stop to this. - Whatcha doing? Are you mad? - Let go. Do you really want to leave them like this? Besides, we need a diversion. - Okay, I'll do the elephants. Okay, that's it. Come on, let's go. - This way. - Ladies and gentleman, your attention please. Long ago before the time of man, there was an age of legend when dark and terrible monsters stalked the land. And all was chaos. - What's happening? - And the world shook to it's very core. And into this world in middle of destruction, a small spark began to grow, ladies and gentleman. A spark of hope, a silver light to pierce the darkness. A creature was born, a hero to brighten the day. A valiant force for good. From his mane, rivers would flow. From his hoofs, sparks would light the forest. And from his horn, spring would melt the frozen grits of winter. Ladies and gentleman, champion of light, king of horses, the unicorn. - Look. - And so, ladies and gentlemen, the battle began. And the unicorn fought these terrible beasts and drove them back into the darkness. - We have to help him. They're killing him. Hey! - Polly, no! - No. Stop those kids. Somebody stop those kids. - You get Spike. I'll stop them. - Come on. - Idiot. - The entrance. Go! - Come on, Spike! - Stop 'em, stop that horse! - Got him. - Get off me. - Don't just stand there. Catch that little wretch. - Dad! - Get back in the car. Go get in the car. - Come on. - Follow Polly. - Come on, Henry. Get a move on, Henry. - Get out of the way, move. - We gotta go that way. - You move your car. - Henry, go, henry, just move the car. - Come on, they went that way. Why are you always so slow, girl? Come on. - Look how fast he's going. I'm going to cut him off. - Slow down. Slow down. - Coming straight for us. - Look! - Yeah! Go Spike! - Look! - Wow. - Yeah, look at that. - Dad! - Spike'll take her home. - Come on, we'll meet her there. - Quick! - Hurry, they're leaving. - Penny, get back in the car. - Polly? Are you alright? - Grandfather! We did it. He's free, Spike's free! - Yes, you did it. - Oh Polly, you're alright. Thank goodness. - Not that you care. - Of course I care. I made a mistake. If you're truly not happy at St. Jude's, then you can live with Granddad, whatever you want as long as you're happy. And I guess it's time to stop making Sid wait too. If he'll still have me. - Well, I guess I don't have a choice. - Congratulations, Sid. - Thanks, Dad. - Spike! Isn't it wonderful? Now, we get to live happily ever after. - Steady, Spike, steady. - Oh, what's wrong? - They're never going to give up and leave Spike alone. What are we going to do? - It's up to Pol. You brought him here. Only you can set him free. - I don't want him to go. - Listen to Granddad, Polly. We all have to make sacrifices for those we love. I know that more than most. But Spike should be free, not chained and whipped. - Come on. - Let it go, boss. The horse belongs to the kids. Everyone can see that. - Maybe. - Please Polly, let him go. He said he was here to put some of the magic back in the world. He can only do that if he's free. - It's your choice. I'll stand by whatever you decide. - I love you, Spike, but you need to be free to run wild but don't forget me, please. There are lots of nice people in the world, just as well as bad ones. - Get away from my horse. - No, boss, let them be. - That's my meal ticket and I'm not going to lose him now. Get away from me. Get away. - Spike! Yeah, go Spike! - Wow! He's flying. - Oh! Oh my. - He's free, Granddad. He's going to bring the magic back.
