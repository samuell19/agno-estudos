Okay, Michael, straight in. Okay boys, are we soaked? Good boy, Pearse. Put your wee hood down, love, and into the hall, good boy. Morning. How are we all? Alright? Good boy. Kai put your wee hood down, love. Oh, that's good for the kids. Right, okay. I'll get it fixed. Okay? - Yeah. I'll get a look at it and see what's wrong with it. Alright. So I will. Well, I'll tell you what... a parent donated that for £3. £3! £3? That's fantastic. Lorraine, that's about all you're worth kid! Seán, what about you? Seán... your Daddy gave us a £20 voucher... for Feloni's Pizza. Great, or what? Mr McArevey? I'm fast. Do you think you could beat me in a race? I think so Sean Óg. Let's put that down. You beat me in a race, I'll give you a pound! A pound? - A pound! He gives me big hugs! Thank you, thank you, okay. Give me fives just. Gimme fives! I love fives. Well, how are you this morning? How's the stomach? All good? Good lad. Have a good day, see you later. Pressure. It's looking down on me... Come in! Sir, wee Jack Bradley was sitting... watching the TV this morning... down in breakfast club. And Conor just came behind him... and took the chair from behind him. For no reason whatsoever. Conor, why would you do that? Talk to me Conor, what happened? Sir, can I go down to the P1s and P2s or do you need me to stay? No, that's fine. Conor, can you take a seat outside please? And I'll speak to you in a minute. Hello, how are you? It's Kevin McArevey, Holy Cross Boys Primary. Right, what's going on? Stand, take this down and let me talk to you. What's wrong? What's going on this morning? Sit up. What happened? I was going to put my stuff down, and he came down and took my chair, and then I did that on him. Right, okay. Tell me this, was this impulsive? Was this something you didn't think you were going to do? You just did it for a laugh? No. No? Why did you do it? 'Cause he took my chair. He took your chair? So he took your chair, so you took his chair? No, I took the chair that I was sitting on. Right. Which he was sitting on. Okay. So what did we say about controlling emotions? The idea is that you have the right strategies in place, to control these emotions. Because you're moving on to the big school next... and I need you to be able to control those emotions, because I don't want you getting in bother, when you leave here. Now... you used the F word? Is that right? Okay. Slipped out? So, these are two things that we are going to have to address. How are we going to address them? Don't know, sir. The idea is that we're going to see Donna, make the apology. You're going to come down to the philosophy board at break time. And you and I are going to have a discussion, about what happened? What you should do now? And how can we move on from it? Okay? Good man! Now, I don't want you going into class, and being upset. This is dealt with, now we move on. So the rest of the day, is a good day. Is that alright? Good lad, away you go. Ready? Yeah. What's that? Triangle. Triangle. Right, what is it? What do you see? A pointy bit. A pointy bit, okay. Pearse, what do you see? A shark. Shark! - A shark. Ok. He sees a shark, a big mouth. Yes, what do you see? An arrow. You see an arrow, he sees a shark. You see a triangle. Mason, what do you see? Lines. You just see lines. Okay, well let's see if we can change it up? What do you see now? Marty? - An M. An M? What do you see? M. Does anybody see anything other than an M? Anything different? I see a mountain. A mountain! So, you see a mountain, he sees a pointy bit and he sees an M. So, tell me this. Who definitely says it's a mountain? Put your thumb up if you say, "Definitely a mountain." Or put your thumb down if you think... it's definitely not a mountain. And then your hand like this... if you think, "I'm not really sure." Okay well let's see if I can change your thinking. You ready? A slide! Spider. A spider! Well let me see if I can change your thinking again, are you ready? Yeah. Give me a count down then... 3, 2, 1 Bike! Bike! Okay, so... thumbs up if it's definitely a bike. Everybody has their thumbs up for a bike. So, did you notice how everybody had... different thinking... on what was drawn on the board? That's what philosophy is all about. Philosophy is all about that different thinking. And listening to other boys' different thinking. And that could change your thinking. So, don't think, "I'm always right." Okay boys? All clear? - All clear! Bye! What I want for this mural is for people to stop and look at it and go, "Yes, I see that." "I can see what they're doing there." "A school full of children who... are thinking about thinking." That's why I want this mural to be reflective of that. When you see those other murals up, you wonder... what's the mentality? Yeah, well that's all about sort of, intimidation and, you know, "We're still in control." "You still have us to face if you don't toe the line" type of thing. There's a lot of antisocial behaviour, and there's a lot of graffiti, and there's a lot of drug pushing... and there's dissident activity... and there's an awful lot goes on in this area. Gentlemen, welcome! First class of the year. Philosophy. In you go, and take a seat. We're going to choose the concept mapper. And we're also going to choose, who's doing the Socratic circle. So if you think about what you wanna do. I should have been an artist. Who would like to be the concept mapper? Tomás, concept mapper, up you come. Tomás will put our thoughts up on to the board, and then he will give us our thoughts back, on our thinking. Who would like to be the Socratic circle? Excellent. You two boys are sitting down here, okay? You're going to give us, from your head, what went well, did my thinking change, and what could be improved for the next time? Yes? Now, question: "Should you ever take your anger out on someone else?" So who would like to kick us off on the question: "Should you ever take your anger out on someone else?" Oisín, I'll start with you. Well it depends, if they haven't done anything to you in the past, you don't have the right to do it. But if they're annoying you, and they make you get angry, then... it's a bit better. Like, you've got more rights to hit them, if they do something to you. Who agrees with that statement? Put your hand up. Okay. Thank you. And your thoughts? I'm actually starting to disagree, because if you... take your anger out on them, you don't know, they could be going through something, like a rough time, and you just made them worse. And they might start being angry with other people. Don't take your anger out on them, because they could be going through a rough time themselves. Did you hear that Tomás? Ché, give me your thoughts. Say like if it's really bad, like they're determined to hit you, they will not give up. So most people in the class are faster than me. So they could probably... outrun me. And I would have no choice but to hit them back, because they're full on coming at me, like full speed, coming to hit me. I agree with Fergal as well, because if they keep hitting you... and you're not going to do anything about it... they're still going to do it. They're going to think, if he's not going to do anything... I'm just going to keep doing it and not get in trouble. Okay. Tomás, give us our thinking back on the question: '"Should you ever take your anger out on someone else?" Right. You shouldn't take it out on someone else, because, if they haven't done anything to you, don't do nothing back to them. Okay. Don't be hitting because you need to make friends. Go and take your anger out on a punching bag. Okay, thank you for that. Socratic circle, guys, what went well? We'll go with Ben first. It was good that everybody was speaking up, about what they think about it, and if they agree with it or not. And if they don't agree with it, what they agree with. Alright, I have to say, that was a great enquiry. Well done. Thank you to the teachers for coming along. Hope you enjoyed that. That was the teachers' first ever philosophy session. Caolan, well done. Guys, fantastic today, well done. Jimmy, I loved what you said. Superb. You took the chair off him and... near hit... His head. H-I-T So that's what happened? Yes. "Tell Miss he took my chair." So, that's what should have happened? Yep. Alright, Good man. "What should you do now?" Is our next one, isn't it? Go. "Said sorry to... the boy." Okay. "And also sorry to..." Miss? Yeah. "And also sorry... Is that how you spell "also"? Yeah, it's one L. Oh! D-O-N-N-A And would that be a small "d" or a capital, do you reckon? Did they see the remorse in you, whenever you said: "Listen, got that wrong. I'm sorry." Yes, sir. Okay, well I'm delighted with that. Now, I think we're ready to look at... ..the philosophical question because.. the "What is x?" question is here. Or, "Life is..." whatever. Hard? Life is hard. Yes, life is hard, yeah. Okay, so, we're going to put in then... eh, "What is saying sorry?" Mrs Reel's ringing me so we've gotta be quick. Back on Monday, you're funny. That's hilarious... I'll see you tomorrow... Mrs Reel... make sure you're back for the gym! Being good to people. Or saying sorry, playing good. You're so sorry? The bell's gone. I'm happy that you've come to the board, and I'm happy that you've answered the questions, and that, your actions this morning were very good. And you're remorseful for what you said, and for your actions. Let's not have it again, eh? Yes sir. Okay. Good lad. That's our local history, that's our narrative. But as I say, that wasn't... three thousand miles away... or some other part of the world. This here, is your own area. My great Granddad... would never let my Granny go outside, because of how dangerous it was. But once she sneaked outside, on her bike... and she got shot, by an IRA man... because the IRA man had already shot a policeman... And, a bullet went in her back. And, we can't get it out still, to this day. Those buses were put up for protection. See unfortunately, we're in 2020, and those burnt-out buses have been replaced... with brick walls and corrugated iron. How many of you are aware that we still have peace walls? How many were not aware of that? How many were not aware that these peace walls exist... separating the two communities, the Catholics and Protestants? It's ridiculous that people are still fighting over Protestants and Catholics. Why don't they just make peace? They're all part of one family. I don't agree with Colm. Like it still does go on but it's not as bad as years ago... when Catholics and Protestants were fighting. Catholics and Protestants are two different people. Catholics pride themselves as Irish and Protestants say they're British. It's two different countries and two different languages. So, are you saying then that the politics and the religion and the culture... sort of separate them and that they're not one people? Yeah. Like we're all part of one family and... I guarantee you that everybody in this class has an Aunty or Uncle... ..or someone related to them that is a Protestant. And... it's just going on again and they're just stupid, just ignorant, because... that's happened like fifty years ago. And it doesn't matter anyway. We all bleed the same colour. We're all the same? Yeah. What I'm trying to do... is bring philosophy... from this hall, kick it through those doors, out through those big blue gates... and booting your front door down, and going into your living room. I'm going to be giving you things to talk about. And I'm going to be showing you how to question your children. The children are going to have... a challenge of the week. So it's a challenge not just for the kids, but for you as well. Shock, horror... you're going to talk with your child! I'm going to tell you how to do it. I'm going to show you how to do it. It's in the book. I'm going to show you how to question. How to get the best out of the children, and how you will become a better questioner... when you go back into work you're going to say: "Oh I'm going to use that, I'm going to use this." And it'll work for you, believe me. "Try not to give your opinion until the end of the discussion." That's so important, because see if you give your opinion... guess what? He's going to follow it. "Falsify the question." Heraclitus said, 'Everything changes.' And he used that story of, "Can you step in the same river twice?" So what he is saying is, you can't, because it's different water, you disturb the river bed, there'll be different fish. So you can't step in the same river twice. Because everything changes. So we want our children... to falsify that statement. Well, I've had two of the best answers... I've ever heard coming from two P7's. One said, "Sir, your DNA doesn't change." And I went, "Wow! That is fantastic." And then another kid said, "But Sir, the past doesn't change." Heraclitus said that it all, everything changes. No-one ever falsified it! Until you come to Holy Cross Boys and two P7 boys do! And that's the beauty of philosophy. Some of the things you hear are amazing. Got you! He got you back. Get away! Right boys, line up please. Six boys on the one boy. How brave! A game that got out of hand. Gentlemen... I'm disappointed, I really am disappointed. Disappointed that you'd pick on Gerard. Those six boys don't play for a week. And you'll join me tomorrow... at my office. For detention? No. Thank God. Philosophy wall? - Philosophy wall. One week, no play. If you don't know how to play, then you won't play. Rory, I'm glad to see that you're remorseful... for what happened. You make sure your apology to Gerard is good. Okay, Sir. Sorry, Gerard. "Today, steady Eddy is going to take us... on a journey to the Crystal City." "Breathe in... two, three." "And out... two, three." "Close your eyes." Gerard, are you okay? "Hand on your heart... and begin breathing slowly and gently." There was this Stoic called Seneca. He came up with ten ways we can control anger. Now I want to see... can you boys match what Seneca talks about, in how to control anger. I will be delighted if we can. One way you control anger? When you put your hand on your heart and you breathe in and out. Ah, control your breathing... with hand on heart. Thank you for that. Dylan, what do you do? See when I get really angry and I just want to scream... I like go into my bed. Because if I just scream so loud... my mummy's going to hear me, and then I'm going to get into even more trouble. So I just go up to my room, I put my head against the pillow, and then I scream into the pillow, and let all my anger out. Good strategy. Scream into the pillow. I don't think Seneca would have that one. Because no one had pillows back then? Tell you what boys Seneca is going to be proud of this class. Okay, hands down, let's see what we've got. Ten ways we can control our anger according to Seneca. It says here, "Just wait, removing yourself from a situation... and deal with it." Do we have that there? Yes, we certainly do. Where we say... went into your room and scream into your pillow, Or you just relax, you lay down and you do nothing. So, we've got that one. Just wait, okay? Next one. Use art and music to calm the mind. Do we have that? Yes, we certainly do! Look at that. We have that as well. Ah we didn't have this one, this is a good one. See yourself as the other person. Putting yourself in that person's shoes, so that you can see from a different angle. See my hand technique I showed you the last time. Yes. That also could help as well. Ah. To get you all relaxed as well. Show me the hand technique again. I want everybody to try... Ethan's hand technique. Good. Hold your left hand up please. And trace around with your right hand. Look. With this hand... Yeah, that is quite soothing. Thank you. Maybe something that I'll try. It tickles! It does tickle, yeah! Thank you, very much. Oh my goodness! Let me see. Alfie! No, no, no. Come here. I'll keep this in my... Alfie, you know the craic, never allowed phones in school. Here, do you want to turn it off for me? Turn it off for me. Good boy. Yep. In the drawer, good boy. Come here a wee second. Turn around to me a second, come here. You know you're not allowed on your phone in school, don't you? It's break time but! - Alfie Don't you understand that your not allowed to use your phone, in school. Because see if you use it, all the other boys will want to bring their mobiles in. Are you alright to come just with me? You and I will have a chat? Come on let's go and see. Right, I can see that you're annoyed. And I'm really glad... that you settled down. By the time Mrs Reel got up those stairs, you were all settled, so that's a really good boy. And that was a quick... way to bring yourself down? Do you want to talk to me about how you're feeling and what's going on? Okay. You tell me, I'll let you tell me. It's just really annoying when you don't have any friends. And like... I don't like going into school because the work's too hard. Now, see when you say those words, Alfie? I can see you're upset. And see when you talk to us... and tell us what's going on, we can try to help you, okay? Nothing is worth thinking and saying things like that. Okay? There's lots of things we can do in school to help you. And there's lots of things that you do brilliantly. And there's lots of times when I know that you're really happy in school. I can see you're annoyed now. I can see you're upset now. And what we can try to do is work out what's going on... that we can help you with? What do you think? Can we try to work that out? Okay. Because I don't like you being sad and I don't like you feeling like this. So have you been bottling things up a wee bit? I was trying to keep it in my head and just not think. But today I was just like, "Right I can't hold it in anymore," and I just tried to. Have you spoken to mummy? Yeah, I told her last night. She said she was going to tell Mr McArevey but she never. She must have forgot to. Okay, right. So you've been feeling really sad... and feeling a wee bit lonely you were saying, with friends. I don't have any friends. Watch your head, okay. The reason, like, I'm that sad is because I don't like being diagnosed... with diabetes. The doctor said I have to cut down on food... and I don't like cutting down on food. You're a bit like Mrs Reel. We like our food, don't we! What's your favourite? If we're getting a pizza, probably Domino's. Domino's pizza, that's your favourite? Yeah, but if we're going to Hudson's... I really like their ice cream because you get to put Smarties in it. Come in. You alright, Tony? Yeah, great. We're having a good wee chat. He's making me hungry. He's talking about food too much here. I'll come up and get him after break? Yeah, you go and have your break. - Alright. Alright for Tony to go and have his break? Thanks, Tony love. Dead on. How come you get this special treatment? Why do you think Tony... is in checking there? Because he's worried. He's worried about you. And he cares about you. And you're very lucky... that you have Tony there to look out for you. Aren't you? So, what's Alfie upset about? So, number one, what would you think? Everything! What's the biggest thing? What's the thing annoying you? Diabetes. Diabetes, okay. Let's write that down. D- A D-I-A Yeah. You're impressed with my spelling? Yeah? Challenge of the week: Picture your favourite place and go there... in your mind to feel good again. Well, my happy place... is a place called Graceland. Elvis Presley's house. It's a beautiful place. So, in my mind's eye, I get stressed, I go there. And I remain there for maybe 20, 30 seconds. And then all of a sudden I start feeling good again. Now, what I want you to do... is I want you to think of your favourite place. And in 10 seconds you're going to go there... you're going to close your eyes, and you're going to see does it work for you, the way it works for me? Okay, I want you to think of your favourite place. You ready? Favourite place... close your eyes, and go there now. See it in your eye. See it in your mind. Concentrate on your favourite place. No one else in the room. Just you... and your favourite place. Okay, open your eyes. Would some of you like to share with me... where you just went to? Alfie, where'd you go? I went to Spain once on my holidays... and there were water slides. In my imagination it was space. Space? I went to Portugal in a hotel... and swam in my pool out the backyard. Where'd you go? McDonalds. McDonalds? Puts a smile on your face, put a smile on everybody else's face. So can you see why... it's a nice challenge? Because once you practice it, it will become a part of you. And whenever you feel stressed... you'll know, close my eyes, and go to that place. Take yourself away from the situation. Aristotle said, "There are three functions of the mind." You remember this? Okay, the three functions of the mind... are: The past, to which it remembers, the present, to which it attend, and the future, to which it expects. There are a lot of people... who can't remove themselves from the past, and they have that baggage. And we've talked about you know, how we need to respect differences. "The loyalists gathered to block the route to the front door... of Holy Cross Girls Primary School. Police and soldiers moved them back. The Catholics began to walk to school. Some children already terrified." "Fenian bastards!" "Missiles began to fly from the Protestant side." we're at the gates It's over, it's over, it's over!" "I ran for my life there. I had one policeman, who held on to me, and I ran for my life with my daughter." "What happened here was all the more shocking... because of the presence of the children. They're supposed to be the inheritors of the peace process. But how many young lives here... are scarred already?'" We're two minutes in. How many boys are shocked by what they saw? My mummy tells me about it, what happened and all. What does your mummy say happened, Paul? That they just... the Protestants just annoying us. It's just scary. My mummy has anxiety, like really bad anxiety and she said she was like, scared to go to school and all, but she had to. There was a documentary covering what happened, and my sister was on it. Because she was only about nine when it happened, and she went to Holy Cross Girls. Cole. It can be disgusting for people to do something like that, in the year that it's in... 2001, that's not long ago. We should all just be normal, and feel free. And, I know people would disagree with me, but that's what I think. There's three words... stop fighting, peace. Stop... - Fighting and then we have peace. "Stop fighting, and peace." "Stop fighting, and peace." Got a philosophy here from Colm who says, "Stop fighting and Peace." That's the thought I'm leaving you with. I just want him to leave me alone! Go away! Oh my God, leave me alone! Conor, away from him. Cut the rough play out, please. Conor go and play. You alright? Alright, come on. Conor told Alfie to beat me up. What? Conor told Alfie to beat me up. Nah, that will not happen son, alright? He thought I slapped him, but I didn't slap him. And he started putting his head into me, like into my chest... Did you lose your temper? No, I lost my temper. No, he lost his temper because he slapped me first. Because everyone was chanting, "Go on Conor, go on Dylan." Conor goes in for a slap then I slap him and then... it just begins in a fight. So Dylan, what is the idea of being a friend? Don't kill each other and care for each other? Conor, what do you see a friend? Real important person. Is Dylan an important person to you? Nmm, not much. Not much? So he's not a friend? No. He's not a friend. Not a friend, okay. Dylan, do you see Conor as a friend? Well yeah, because he's my cousin. Because he's your cousin? So why do you not see Dylan as a friend, Conor? Well, I did see him as a friend until he started acting all hard. Your idea of a friend is an important person. Anything else? Someone that I play with a lot, and I protect them and they protect me. In the past has Dylan done that for you? I protected him a lot but... Only once properly. No, a lot. Has he protected you? Has he been a friend to you in the past? Like protecting-wise? No. Well, maybe I took the blame for something, for you. If it's physically, then no. But if it's like, he took the blame for me, then, yes. So is that a friend for you? Yes. So you could see Dylan being a friend again? Maybe. If he stops acting all hard like. Dylan, he has accused you of acting hard. In what way are you doing this? I don't understand. I don't act hard. Well, sometimes when I'm with my mates. But I don't act hard all the time. Well most of the time. Like in school sometimes. So, are you going to address that, Dylan? Are you going to, maybe not act the way... Conor has asked? What do you think? Yeah, okay. Is there a possibility that we can move on and be friends? Yeah. So, what are we going to do now? Make-up and shake hands? Away you go. Thank you. Every time I see these kids, especially in an area like this... And they're fighting... it just brings me right back. It brings me right back to... I think to... when I couldn't control things. I had no control. I was like those kids. I sorted everything out with... - Fists? - Fighting, and... when the drink comes in, and you really can't manage your emotions. Things just got worse for me, just went from bad to worse. And that was tough. That was tough for me, really. It did happen... and Mr. Johnson did witness it. So, he hit him on the side of the arm. So, he struck a member of staff. What do you think? I think we should consider a suspension. Sir, will you give Alfie some extra work... because he is going to be working, his mum said, until his bedtime. What happened? I hit Tony. Why? I don't know. You're here to do a job, and make sure he gets a good education. Not to be struck, Alfie. Know what I mean? You can do this. Come on. Let's go. I know, I know. Alfie, what's wrong? Alfie, look at me. Look at me. I'll be speaking to your Mummy. Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll speak to her. And I'll be telling her how remorseful you were... how it didn't mean to happen, and it will never happen again. Okay? So don't you worry. I'll have a wee word with her. Let's go. Good lad. We got a phone call to the school from the Flax Centre. You don't know anything about something this morning? Any idea what that could be to do with? I was having a drink, and Bailey made me laugh, and... I went like this... and it went on the floor, and I didn't see it... and then when we went out, I looked back, and... the guy said that me, Ché, Bailey, and Samuel are barred, because I went like... The thing about that is... what uniform have you on there? Holy Cross. Holy Cross Boys. That's why they're phoning us. And when you're wearing a Holy Cross uniform, you're representing us... all of us! And Holy Cross, you know that we're not just a school, we're a family. And whenever somebody is being silly, or being bold, or carrying on... it lets down everybody, and affects all of us. Alright? You're a great guy, Conor, and you know Mrs Reel thinks the world of you, but it's not what the man said, on the phone call... See, if somebody's in a shopping centre, and they're just talking... nobody's going to say "You're barred." So, it had to be a wee bit more. You need to think very carefully, because I'm going to have to speak to each of these boys to find out what happened, Conor. So, I want you to think really, really carefully... You know when you say things, don't we always find it out? Don't we? Ethan, let's go. I want you sit with your back straight. I want you to close your eyes. For the next one minute... I want you to think of nothing. Try your best. Okay, open your eyes. Is it possible to think about nothing? Yes. Yes, it's possible to think about nothing? Can you say why? Because if you think of blackness which is nothing, you're thinking about nothing. Alfie! It's possible but at the same time it's really hard, because if you're thinking of nothing and just total blackness, you're still thinking. You're thinking of total blackness. I did it. And I wasn't thinking of anything. But do you know what happened? I decided to roll my eyes down. Do you know, I seen my throat! I actually seen my throat! I was like, "Oh, that's creeping me out." Okay, so. When you were trying to think of nothing, you imagined that your eyes had rolled to see your throat? Yeah. Listen lads, that's his thinking. Remember, it's caring philosophy. Everybody's opinion matters. Holy Cross Boys. Now, again we have no confirmed reports... of anybody with Coronavirus If there were, I would be informed. Morning, how are we? Great boy, and the other wee one too. Great boy, rub a dub, dub. Superstar! Morning. Did you get your super juice before school? Good man. Will we do Elmo? There you go Elmo. That must be one of our old ones in his new uniform. Oh so it is. Hi Conor! - Hi, miss. Is it going okay? - Yeah. Anybody in your class you know? No, this is my first time going. Oh, it's only the first day? Yeah. - Oh, wow, cool. Ach, I hope it goes great. You look brilliant anyway. I got my own mask, don't worry. Oh, have you? Great boy. Well, listen... have a great day won't you? And do us proud! Yes. Now you're representing Holy Cross, don't forget... Alright? Once a Holy Cross Boy...? always a Holy Cross Boy. Remember that, okay. I know over Lockdown, you've been spending a lot of time on the internet. So, the question I'm asking you is this: What experiences have you.. of bullying online? An anonymous account started texting me and calling me names. So I was playing Minecraft on Hunger Games, like just messing around. Then, I think like I got a friend request from someone. And I accepted it. And she sent to me, "Come follow me." I forget what she said to follow her on, but she said she'd send me naked pics... Ssshhh. Okay... I typed her that I am ten years old, and I started just talking to her... then I blocked her instantly, and just went back to playing. Good lad. You handled that well. I was playing Fortnite and they said I'm a smart fridge. And then they say you're garbage. Someone hacked into my Instagram account and put up on my story, "I'm going to kill myself." Put up on your story, you were going to kill yourself? You were? No, they just put up, "I'm going to kill myself." My family thought... I was playing a game... and someone was dressing up somewhere and I was on a movie, and they kept on telling... and they were getting bullied... and they kept on telling me to kill myself. There was a school called Holy Cross, McArevey was the boss... but Elvis was the King, he always loved to sing, but he could not do the floss! Was that me doing the floss? Give them a round of applause! So, the idea we had... the Greek pillars, your philosophers... And then, just along here you have one of your... Quotes. - Quotes. That would be amazing. Now all we have to do is secure the wall. There's one out there right beside the school. Where? There. Oh, you mean that wall? It would be nice for them. To have Conor as 'the thinker, ' is terrific. There's no one in my time here... who tried all the strategies that we talked about, and Conor really did try them. Renegade! Renegade! Renegade! Are you ready? Here we go. Bop! Bop! Ippity bippity bop! Ippity bippity bop! Ippity bippity bop! - Ippity bop! Sit down! Bop! Bop! I love it! Ippity bippity bop! Oh good! Bop! - Bop! Bop! Bop! Ippity bippity bop! Bop! Oh no! Alfie! Alfie! Yeah Alfie! Alfie! Tony! Get to the front of the line. And get to the back of the line! He just comes over and punches me! You are family! Family stick together. Families shouldn't be fighting, shouldn't be quarrelling. I should not be putting two cousins... into detention. I mean we thought the first time this happened... it would be solved, that the two of them would work things out, Conor? Up here. - Yes Sir. They would work things out. Yes Sir. Do you know what I mean? But... It hasn't worked out. Why? Why has it not worked out? I mean yesterday, the answer you gave me in philosophy... was brilliant! Absolutely brilliant. I was thinking, "Wow!" And then you lost your emotions today. Didn't you? It's just sometimes... well my daddy says, "If anybody starts at you, or they hit you, always hit them back." Socrates. People want you to believe their answers. They don't want you to think for yourself. It's time to think for yourself. Challenge statements that you hear. Challenge it! "But what if?" Anything that you hear. Everything that all of your families went through... I do not think... they want to go through it again. And that's violence boys. Violence... breeds violence. It never stops. But you boys have the power to stop it. It's not about who can punch the hardest, or who can hurt someone the most, but I'm trying to get across here, something that is in all of our homes, that we're trying to break down, that we're trying to get into the heads of our parents, is to "Why?" "Why do you think like that?" "Why do you want me to be that person?" "Why do you want me to be you and not me?" "I'm not you." "I'm me." Okay. I want to show you... how to question your parent. Okay? Cole is my father. I'm his son. He has told me... I've always gotta hit back. No matter what. No matter what, I've gotta hit back. Ah Da! Had a hard day at school today. What happened son? I got hit in the yard today again, Daddy. And did you hit back? No. I told you it's better to hit back. See when you hit back Daddy... how did it make you feel inside? Tiny bit proud, tiny bit doubtful. What sort of emotions were you feeling then Daddy? I don't know. Sorrow? I felt bad. You see Daddy that's the way I feel. If I hit him back it makes me the same as him. I don't want to be the same as him, Daddy. And I know you want me to hit back. And I know that's the way you were brought up, but... I just don't wanna hit anybody. I want to solve it. I mean... I could go to the teachers or the classroom assistants or... or I could come and talk to you and hope that... you'd sit down and not tell me to go out and hit. Okay then, that's okay. Am I good then? Do you know what Daddy? I love you. Give him a round of applause! Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Is he away early? That's it, Elvis is getting it! Elvis is in the bin, and I'm going to send him a photograph. > If I can dream of a better land, > where all my brothers walk hand-in-hand, tell me why > oh why, > oh why can't my dream come true? > Oh why? > There must be peace and understanding > sometime. > Strong winds are promised that will blow away...
