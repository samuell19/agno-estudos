ABS Company Hleb Studio Russian Society of the War History -Take them out of the wagon! -Yes, sir. Damn this country, and damn this weather. Come on, hurry up. Move your asses. It's freezing here. You've heard these stories? That's what I'm thinking. We better get away from here. Calm down. Why does he have a sack over his head? No idea. We got him like this. Maybe he's a spy? Take it off of him. Let's see who he actually is. Please just be calm, officer. We are just artists, just actors, and we perform... in hospitals for wounded soldiers. No, we're not the soldiers. We are... we're artists. We're not soldiers. I don't speak it. I don't speak German. And here, this woman is my wife. What's the German for kids? Child! Children! Two children. Who the hell is he? Well, he's definitely... not Hitler. I think he said they're actors. They perform theater plays. Hey, you. Show us your theater. But Sergeant, are we even allowed to shoot Hitler? I want to see how... these Communists portray our leader, okay? You, scum. Show us your performance or I'll shoot you in both your legs. And then, I'll make you watch us... kill that bitch of yours. Do you think he understood it? Well translate for me. I can't translate it. I only know a few Russian words. Translate. That's an order. Show me. Show us. Show us. But, but, show, show what? What can we show? Show him what? Show. Maybe, 'theater'? Show us some theater. Theater? Theater! Theater. He wants us to show theater. I understand. I would need... one, one minute. Thank you. -Hey, Lyonya. They'll kill us for this. -Ninochka, shh. Listen to me. Yeah. Look, it's our chance. Maybe our only hope. He said, maybe they'll let us go. I'll do it. Yeah? Nina, I love you so much. Attention, attention. Germany... above all! It is our new... actor. Germany... actor! Our new cantaloupe, without cantaloupe, without, this is Germany! Don't shoot. These. There he is. 74, 21, -What's he babbling? -No idea. I don't understand. Is he mad? Germany, above all! Heil! Don't shoot. -Don't shoot. Don't-- -Stop it. They'll kill us for this. Stop! That is not funny. Now I'm gonna show you real theater! Attention! Present arms! Aim! Lord, please have mercy. -Where is he? - I don't see anything. See? And people don't believe in God! But God exists! Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so very much. Where-- Where are you from? Did you... and where are the others? Are you alone? You're alone? They caught me and my wife. It happened yesterday. We were just driving, and they stopped us. And they killed the... the driver. His name was Yura. They killed our driver, Yura! They just killed him. The fascists-- Don't worry that I look like Hitler. We're actors. We perform in military hospitals, you see? And I really, really hate Hitler. I really hate that piece of scum, you know? Thank you. And I don't want-- Please wait! Please! Just tell us your name! Stand up. Stand up! Now. No dirty tricks. Konstantin, search him. I'm friendly. I'm a friend. Well, we'll see, won't we? What are you smirking at? Move. Move your ass. I wish it was summer, and we'd all go to my house by the sea. Imagine it's a lovely hot day. Your feet, they stick to the sand, cause it's so hot, scorching hot. And the sea,, it feels warm like fresh milk. Then you run back to the house, where there's a huge keg, and it's full... of cold beer. You fill a glass full, and drink it in one gulp. But right now, I'd even make do with a warm beer. Don't fire. It's just us. -Commander, -What? We found him in the woods, frozen to hell. Go sit down. Is he German? Looks like one of ours, Russian. Can we use his greatcoat, you think? Sergeant, remove his coat. Here. Here, have some. Don't anyone relax just yet. Be ready to set off. Come on, move your asses. Move your asses! Why did you bring him? You could've shot him on the spot. Shot him? So why would I shoot him? Without knowing more about him? And what if he really is one of ours? We've seen that sort of 'ours' before. Deserter. And what are you then? Lieutenant, you think you could carry him now? Put him down. My back. Save your strength, you shouldn't talk so much. Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous. Ready? Talking is not such a big deal. Do you have a smoke? Just try to keep still. We'll take you to the hospital. Now keep still. Your wound may open up again. How much longer? If God grants it, we'll reach my friend by dinner tomorrow. And will your friend have moonshine? That's the only thing you care about? -I'm pouring out my-- -Sergeant, just stop this talking. What sort of person are you? Always talking, talking, talking. It's just my character, Lieutenant. I know a story about character. The Germans, they were going to shoot three captives. They put them against the wall. A Russian, Englishman, and a Frenchman. Those Germans, kind as they are, offered to fulfill their last wishes. The Englishman asked for... whisky. Well they brought whisky and he swigged it down. The Frenchman says, “I'd like some Champagne.” And so they gave him champagne. “And you Mr. Russian. What's your last wish?” He says “My wish is like this, I want someone to come and give me a big kick in the ass.” They said, "And this is really your last wish, you oaf?” "Of course,” he replied. So the fattest kraut in all of Germany, he kicks him hard, right in the ass, and the Russian flies like a cannonball, and ricochets against the wall and back into the fatso. He grabs his machine gun, and shoots the Germans dead. The prisoners, well, they run away. And the Englishman asks, “Why didn't you just grab his gun at the start?” "It's just my character.” You see? Unless we Russians get a kick in the ass, we won't move a finger. I have a similar anecdote but... but it... has a different ending. The same characters are captured and they're offered a last wish. The krauts, they say, “Right, the one who can hit this sparrow will be released.” A glass is filled with Champagne, the Frenchman drinks it and carefully takes aim. -Kolya. -And he misses the sparrow. They kill him. Same with the Englishman. And the Russian, the Russian, he asks his German captors for a whole bottle of vodka-- Kolya? Kolya? Kolya! Kolya! Don't you, don't you dare! No! Don't you dare! Come on then, help him! Will you just help him? Come on! No! Kolya, please don't go. I'm begging you. -Kolya! -His soul... has passed over. Kolya! So beautiful here. In total, sixty-one victims, in a matter of two and a half months. What makes you think that all these dead are connected with each other? The same signature. We think it's likely that there's a solitary sniper at work here. Our soldiers started to call him "Red Ghost."” And you mean to tell me that you can't liquidate a single shooter? Have I understood it correctly? Well, now it's your job, Commander. Klein will brief you on the details. Best of luck. Tell me then, who is this Red Ghost? Where's my gun? Mine now. Got a smoke? I have a smoke. Give it back then. Been on the go long? Quite some time. Since we broke through, we're on the go all the time. It'll be easier soon. Once we kill you-- Don't be stupid. Just a joke. Here. But if you start acting stupid again, I'll shoot you. -Got me? -Yeah. Hey, soldiers! Stop that snoozing! Reveille! Konstantin, come here. Come on guys, hurry up. We haven't got far to go. And? No-one out there. Not a soul. Check the barn, Kostya. Call the guys. What are you doing? -Are you nuts? -Hey! What the hell's going on? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Just calm down! Are you crazy? Don't interfere, Pops! Did you see what he did? What are you doing? Idiot! He saved your damned life! My friend never kept vodka here. Everything's poisoned. A trap laid by the fascists for the Partisans, or maybe it's that avenger. Ten people in the village... have died after stupidly drinking this vile liquid. You should thank him for saving your life. Not fighting him. Idiot. Why would they do that? Don't look so pleased. It's all been poisoned. Even the vodka. A gift from them Germans. When are we going to eat properly? Try to find some clean clothes for me. Why are you standing there? Look in the chest. So good. So good. What's up? What you looking at? Never seen a pregnant woman before? How? What are you talking about? Don't you know how babies are made? I'm such a fool. Will this do? That'll do it. Three days ago, six of our best men were killed in Nizovskaya. Then, in the village of Ivanovo, two of our men were killed. In the last big battle... that took place in the village of Lenskoye. -They killed sixteen men. -Do you like 'Banya'? -Excuse me? -Banya. Like a sauna, but with steam. To be honest, not really. What, not even in such a frost? Have you heard of 'Black Banya' at all? Yes. There's one nearby. German sauna is nice, but 'Black Banya" is a real challenge. Banya's a passion. In weather such as this, it warms you to the very bone. Which says a lot about the Russians. You should study your enemy. How they live. How they think. How they wash themselves. The Russians love extremes. They have a rather hard life. Well, they have no choice really do they? Oh but they do. Where is that bath house? Not far from here. So, is this sector cleared? Yes sir, this is my sector. No enemy here. Well, then let's go. Comrade! Stop! Don't move anything on the table. Now listen carefully to the orders. We'll go to the village, and we will look for products, such as matches and the like. After this, we'll move on. You've time for a rest. No. I'll go with you. - You'll stay with her. - Me? No, him. Sergeant, nod your head when I speak. Of course. Shit! It's steamy here. No. God! Good job. Come in. What are you staring at? How do you like my still-life? -Your idea? -Yes, and it seems to work as well. We killed four soldiers last week. Look at this, Commander. The Russians pray to two gods. You think it's any different for us? I'm sorry. Clear the table. The food here is making me hungry. Organize something, Klein. Already on the way. Boys, hurry it up! Be quiet. Stop. Stop there. - It's the Germans. - Holy shit. Where's Vera? Back at the house. You disobeyed my order. You want me to fight alone, is that it? Just me, eh? 30 Germans, and I've got 30 bullets. I just stepped out to take a piss-- Looking for moonshine. You really are a son of a bitch. So what if I was? What's your problem? What you gonna do, shoot me? So what do we do now? Hey, Gunther! Here, look at this. A present... from the Eastern Front. We should take a photo. -Great. Take your places. -Hey, give it to me. Hold it. Are we taking this photo? Right, all stand together. All right, now. Yeah. Can't you hold the piglet eh? Let it go. No. Why? You wanna dance with it? A dance with a Russian beauty. Was that Vera? Just them morons having fun. One doesn't play with food. You have problems with discipline. Don't be so strict with them. The soldiers are tired and need some fun. Not the soldiers. Only officers are entitled. Three men in the trench. Sixteen in the yard. Who knows how many inside. Not 30, for sure. Oh, come on. We'll wait. How long? Pops, keep your eyes on the farm, and report about any movements you see. -With God's will, they'll leave. -And if they don't go? Then we'll act accordingly. Check the ammunition. We move out at dusk, if she's still alive. Tell me, Klein, do you also believe in this Ghost? Don't know. To be honest, I don't. But... according to witnesses, he comes out of the blue, and is unusually strong and brave. The Russians have a saying, "Fear has big eyes". And this barbarous ritual, with the torn-off epaulets, it is simply a provocation by the Partisans. I don't think the peasants would lie. People don't lie at the threshold of death. It is okay. If he is really as you describe him, then I'd like to meet him. It's uncomfortable here 'cause it's so cold. Gunther, get to work. Yes, sir. Koch, when is it ready? Don't you worry. -It's all getting sorted. -Get a move on! I'm getting hungry. Can't wait much longer. It would go quicker if you stopped pestering me. Can't see a thing through this damn snow. Hey, frozen boy. Come over here. Here. Now you watch. I can't see well from this far. Make sure you pay attention. -Firing up the bathhouse. -You're sure? The bathhouse? The Germans? Well, I'll be damned. I hope you roast here, Braun. -What's wrong with his eye? -Huh? Battle wound? No, it's not a battle wound. As a kid, he was stealing apples from someone's garden. The owner came out and shot his rifle in the air. The kids, they jumped down from the apple tree. But he fell, from the very top. A branch went through his eye. And it was... my garden. So now I kinda... feel responsible for him, in front of the Lord. It's just how it is. But it turns out, he's an excellent hunter. What are we doing just sitting here? And what do you suggest? Have a death wish? We need to act cleverly, like, say, that Ghost. Who? The Red Ghost. The sauna is ready in one hour. If I were you, I would think twice before going to the sauna. Maybe it's not a good idea. Firstly, it's "Black Banya'. Secondly, you are not me. You misunderstood-- Thirdly, you don't have authority to interrupt! Yes, Commander. Get up! This is horrible work and the worst unit I have ever seen in my life! I'm not at all interested in your opinion about what I should, or shouldn't do. If you can't understand this, then your place is not here, but outside in the yard, with the pigs. -Clear enough? -Yes, Commander! It won't happen again, Commander! Good. Then let us leave this subject, or our young soldier will pass out. Tell me, what's your name? -Gunther. -Gunther. Take a seat. He is not well in his company. Yeah, that's true. Do you know how they call our Commander? Braun? Hangman Braun. Do you know why they would give him... a nickname such as that, then? I don't want to know it! Anyway, it's better to hunt for some imaginary ghost than to fight at the front. Yeah, definitely. He's had them by the balls all winter. If a German gets careless, or strays away from his group, that's when the Red Ghost makes his move. He kills them, then disappears into thin air. They say, he's sent one hundred krauts to meet their maker. And to make it clear who's done it, he tears off the officers" badges. He gets into their heads, you see? Gets right into their heads. -And fills them with terror. -A hundred? Huh? A hundred of them? Well, maybe more. They burnt our village to the ground. Only me and Konstantin managed to survive. We hid in the woods. It's personal for Kostya and me with them krauts. And now because of my friend. I thought we'd... go to... the front with the guys. Join the Partisans and then show them fascist murderers. But now, I guess, we'll have to... -do it here. -One man kills them? A hundred? Maybe he's immortal. Maybe, yes. I've never met him, but that's what people say. But how long can a loner survive? Well, Gunther, are you ready to try the best meal on the Eastern front? -Tell me, Gunther. -Yeah? Since you're such a wonder kid, How long is the... Great Wall of China? In a straight line, its length is... 2450 kilometers. But with its branches it is... 8851. Very good. And if we multiply... and eight... hundred and 35? I have no idea. Mueller, -what do you have there? -Where? Right there in your hands. Oh, this. I found it down in the cellar. That is so dangerous. The devil's drink! Aren't you aware that taking moonshine is strictly forbidden? Not a single sip without me! Understood? It was along this line... along sector seven. What is this here? This one? Sector six. How far away is that? 30 kilometers. There were no assaults in that area of the big ghost. If one looks at the assaults, -there is exactly a triangle. -Exactly. But how can one get from A to B... in one night? - I don't know. - I guess he's not alone. I think he's traveling in a group with other people. I think possibly they are two, three or four snipers. But tactically... tactically those places have no meaning. I don"t know but... -the assaults mostly happened-- -Soldier! What is it? Oh! Hello. Bravo, Gunther. I was right about you. You're a real German gallant. But we can't keep this poor young lady in the trunk. It's unbecoming. Come. In what month are you? How long do you have to go? Water, please. I need to drink water. She wants water. Let her answer my question first. Answer the question if you would, please. Your life depends on answering it. Yeah. Seven months, and two weeks. She's heavily pregnant Not so long to go. And what was she doing in the trunk? How did... you end up here? I live... I live here. She lives here. She lives in the trunk? Must not be very comfortable. The sauna's ready. Finally. She is from this family. Commander. She's in none of the photographs. I... I... lost my way in the woods, you see. I... I... and... I just came here and I found this farm and, and settled in this house and... then I got scared and... and so, then I hid myself there in... in the trunk and... Gunther? They are... her relatives. She was looking for food and... some warmth. She... got scared, and hid herself in the trunk. I don't believe her. Don't be so suspicious, Klein. She's hardly the Red Ghost. You must tell us the truth. Otherwise we will have to kill you. Do you know the Red Ghost? Just stay calm. No-one is going to kill you. Now, what do you know about the Red Ghost? Who? -The Red Ghost. -No, no! No, I know nothing! I know nothing! Please don't kill me! I'm begging you! For the sake of my baby! Please, have mercy! I haven't done anything wrong. Just let me go. Please, think of my child. I've done nothing wrong. I beg of you! Commander, I knew it. What is it then? This is yours. Pity. Such... a pity. You were not honest with us... Vera. You know what to do, Klein. No, thanks. I won't need an interpreter. Gunther, have you ever killed a woman before? Get used to it, Gunther. It's war. The food is ready. Can you smell it? Roast pork. Yeah. Look at him. The pig sleeps like a baby. If it wasn't for him, we'd now be eating the best dinner on the Eastern Front. Hey, don't distract me, or I will never finish this damn letter. To hell with them. To hell with them. - No! - What's going on in there? What's going on, my friend? They found a woman. Everything's good. By the way, what about the music? Put Marika on. Quick, quick, amigo. By the special request of Under-Officer Schmidt, we have... Singing now... Will be the incomparable... Marika... Rökk. Wonderful! Simply fabulous! Vera. We can kill them, if we're quiet. It can't be done. What? Nothing we can do. -We can't abandon her! -We're getting out. What the hell do you think you're going? -Damn fools! -Idiots! This is insanity! Turn the music off. You really think it'll help her? Captain, she is obviously pregnant. Is this really necessary? You're right. Hanging doesn't seem like a good idea. One bullet is enough. You will not be able to survive long out here. What did you say? You will die. God will make you suffer. As I do, or worse. Translate! She says that... God will punish you. So, God, you say? Take. You have two minutes. I'll leave you two alone. Shit! - Where is he. Vera... Who took the shot? Hey, look! He's there. Hey, wait! Where you going? I'm going left, you take right. I thought this sector was clear? Machine gun! Get down! Hit the ground! Give me your gun! I don't have it. On the count of three. I'm gonna spill their guts. One... two... three! Right, here we go. Go on, get over there! How many assailants do you see? I count three. It's him! He really exists! Did you see him? It's really him. The Red Ghost! Calm down, soldier! Throw me the rifle! Quick! Koch... Koch... What now, Commander? We have a truck! Koch? Yes? Shoot at the Banya and distract him. You understand? Yes, sir. Koch's hurt! I'm fine. Just a scratch. After three. Okay. One... Two... Three! You, there! Don't give me orders! Oh my God, I can't move so fast. What do you see? He's gone. Kostya, the door. My God, it's really him? -Who? -The Ghost. Who do you think? Check how he is! -Breathing. -Good. He doesn't... die so easily. Did you see how many Germans he killed? This man's... a proud warrior. It's for Kostya, this bread. Uh-huh. Go take it over to him. Commander, did you see how I killed the machine gunner? My eyes, they're still sharp. And the Germans, they shat their pants! I knew something bad would happen when you guys decided to leave. Me, too. Here you go, Kostya. Eat. Water! You bastard! Everyone's against me. I'm telling you, we're right here. And where is Taraskovo? -This here is Taraskovo. -And the Germans? Just here. Then we go via Taraskovo. I know it well. I know every stone, I know it well. That's with maps or no maps. I know every pine tree. -I don't need a map. -Where'd your friend hide his booze? Is that all you think of? I can't believe you'd ask about booze at a time like this. There's so much food! Hot food, even a sauna. I guarantee you there's booze here somewhere! I'm covered in lice! Sergeant, look at this. A hole, here, in the German' front. With a little luck, we will find our people tomorrow. What do we do with that guy? We carry him around like a king? If necessary, we will. Now that's enough! Just get ready to go, will you? Oh, it's coming. It's coming! What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? Arman? Two more over here! This minute! Listen to me, Arman. We're losing precious time. It's taking way too long. What? Who the hell is that? Wonderful. Kostya, open the door for me. I can't believe our group is growing. A new member! What a surprise! Come on! I just need to grab your legs! Push! Push! Push! Push! That's right. Yep. Yep. Right, right! With God's help, you can do this. Come on, you just need to breathe. Breathe, breathe. Like this. Like that. What are they doing here? Out with you! Go on! Get out! -Right now! -Stay! Is this your first? I've delivered three babies before. Here comes number four. Hold her tight! Push! Push! Push! That's it, good. Come on, girl! Yeah! That's it! Come on, girl. You can do it. With God's help, you'll soon give birth. -No, I can't! -You can! Of course you can! Back in the past, women gave birth in haystacks. -They didn't make a fuss about it! -No! -Hold her! You're almost there! -I don't want to! Why so quiet? You have an anecdote or something? About what? -The one about sparrows. -Oh. So, a Russian asks for a bottle of vodka. He drank a bottle, and then got another. And then he drank that one. And then he gets a third bottle. And by now he's getting... just really, really drunk. -I can't! -Come on, come on! Now, breathe like that. Go on! Go on! Do it like I showed you. That's it. Well, he takes the gun, and... shoots the sparrow into a thousand pieces. The Germans ask, "How are you able... to hit it?" And the Russian replied: "It's really not a problem when you've had four bottles, then there are sparrows everywhere! Yes! Push! That's funny. Tell me it's going to be okay! -Please tell me it'll be okay! -Just imagine it's all over. It will be over very soon. It's like, it's like when you need to take a shit. -But you can'! -Breathe! And breathe. That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! Here. Push! What is it? The Ghost had it on him. It's him as a child. I think. He looked very different as a child. As did I. -Return it. -I'll give it back. Push! And push! Yeah, well done! Well, look at that! Hold on. There he is. There he is. It's all done. -That's it now. -My baby. That's it. It's done. Yeah. Blabber-mouth! Come here now! Come here! Now, get me a knife. No, hold it over the fire. My child. Yes. God guide my hand. God be with me. Right then. All done! That's it. -It's a boy? If's a boy? -Finished. Yes. -It's a boy? -Yes. Yes it is. And you said... you couldn't do it. Well, you did. "I don't want to." The Germans must be coming. He can smell them. Yes, I know. I know, I know, I know! Get ready for battle. -There's only five. -How many? You must be joking, Commander. I didn't hear what you said. How many enemies you have said? Five? And how many soldiers did you have under your command? Arman! Arman! Haul out. Yes, sir. Oh, wait... or maybe you were attacked by five Red Ghosts? There is no ghost. Just a handful of half-frozen Partisans. Grenade launcher! Fire! Get away from here! Come on! Fire! Get away and hide! Wait! Wait! Forgive me, son. For everything. Please forgive me. Go on! Go on! Go on! Fire! I dare you to come closer. Take your positions! The Germans, there! Now, just a little closer. Closer. A bit more. German pig! See if you can take me alive! It's okay. It's okay, my love. Give me a couple of soldiers, and I'll take care of it myself. Colonel, give me the chance... to restore my honor. Very well. Forward! Go! Faster. Go on, taste my lead then! How many are there? Three. Try this for size! Throw me the gun! Come and get it, suckers! Fire. Fire. Fire. Louder! At my command, you, you, and you, with me. Right... now. Now you can answer to God. Ok, you and you. Charge! Shitting yourself, huh? Damn pigs! Forward! Faster! Faster! You son of a bitch! Calm down, darling. Calm down. It's okay! It's okay! Now you're gonna get it! Give me that gun! Faster! The munition. What are you doing? Give me the gun! Oh, baby. It's all fine. Well that shut them up. Grenade! Oh, shit! Are you still alive? We're alive and kicking your ass! This is my home! I'm here! Lieutenant! I told you I'd find it! Two soldiers! You and you! Charge! Goodbye, pig! What's the matter, huh? Move your hand! Right then, anesthesia! You'll live! We're not going to die, you hear me? Come on, let me at you! I Killed the Red Ghost! I did it. I did, I did... I did it! You wait here, friend. I'll be right back. I just need to-- Partisan? Just an actor. An artist. Are you the Red Ghost? No, you don't get it. I'm an actor. I'm not a Partisan. You see, ... I perform at... at the military hospitals-- And for-- You were protecting Partisans! And so you shall be punished. But, if you tell the truth, we'll forgive you. Then, you will get German canned meat. Who has seen the Red Ghost? Your friend here will suffer a horrible death. We do not want that to happen. Herman. Who's seen the Red Ghost? I have. I have seen him. Speak up. It's just a ghost. Nothing special. Go. There's a road to Bereznyaki. And then a... a fork in the road, and a small road leading to a ravine. You sure you're getting all this? Yeah. After fifteen hundred feet-- But now, snow covers the ground, so you have to fight your way forward. And hurry, otherwise you might just catch a cold. Faster... Do not stress me. Now, walk until you reach a clearing, to the north. Soon you will find you've reached a very distinctive landmark. A German truck. And around it, you'll find four of your frozen and crooked soldiers. You see, it was they who found the Red Ghost. And you'll find him too. A joke. An artist. That's good. You got it. That's right, fascist. Did I not say, I'm an artist! Artist, fascist! I am the artist! I can sing too, don't you know! ♪ Rise up my country for soon ♪ ♪ You will hear a mighty command ♪ ♪ Those fascists ♪ ♪ We must bring them down ♪ ♪ For they have...♪ Just shoot him. -Lyonyal -Nina! Lyonya, Lyonya, Lyonyal Lyonya, you're alive! -Oh my God! -Nina! Mister artist, is that really the Red Ghost?
