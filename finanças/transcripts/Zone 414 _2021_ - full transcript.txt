Begin in three, two, one. You're cleared. This place... it must end. Look at me. Look at me! I'm so afraid for you. You know, I hear the future like a voice. Do you know what it says? It says that all of these men will perish along with those who help them. Complete, time recorded. Please leave, Mr. Carmichael. Mr. Veidt will be with you in a moment to finish your evaluation. You said you take your coffee black, yes? Yeah. I prefer my food untampered. Untampered? That's a way to put it. Untampered. I'm Joseph veidt. You're the one who contacted me? No. No, I'm the one who sees the candidates. I'm the psychologist of the family. Times like these, I prove my usefulness. Sit down. Virtually no hesitation. This is the fastest time we've seen. Jaden was programmed to defy, to evoke an empathy response. Most people never take the shot. I know what's alive and what isn't. Because we told you that Jaden was a machine. But we could have lied to you. Then you would be a murderer. Then the veidt corporation would be my accomplice. You make machines. You said it was a machine. I usually find the simplest way to look at things is best. You have military experience. Do you have problems with authority? Anybody ever answer that question with anything but a no? Do you have problems with authority? No. You were a police detective. You retired. Uh. The file gives no reason for your retirement. You're a top-ten listed company. I'm sure you found out why I retired. Well, I would like to hear it from you. During the apprehension of an assailant... My partner and the assailant were both fatally wounded. How? The assailant took my partner hostage. I did not follow protocol. Why didn't you follow protocol? Do you regret what you did? I live with what I did. Instead of charging you with a crime, the police department allowed you to retire. Is that a problem? Not right now. We reached out to potential hires through uncommon channels. It wards off some people. Why did you respond? I need the money. Even though you don't know what the job is? Still need the money. And if I told you the job was killing someone, would that change your mind? Yeah. I'd tell you to go fuck yourself. Hmm. My part of the evaluation is done. You've earned the right to meet my brother. Hello, David. Welcome to my humble empire. Come, come. The task is my daughter... Melissa. Three weeks ago, she went missing. And you didn't go to the police? I don't need them to find her for me. I know exactly where she is. I need someone discreet... Someone that won't ruin pragmatism with principle. I'm not sure I understand. I'm sure you don't. Let me assist you. What do you know about zone 414? Well, that's the only place where androids are allowed to freely interact with human beings. My androids. Yeah. Do you know what I did with my technology? I built the antidote to the loneliness of the modern world. Companionship is rare these days. I saw a gap, and I filled it. So the government rewarded me with zone 414, a place where I could field test my creations to see how they interact with humanity. Zone 414, the city of robots. Have you been there? Uh. A cop's wage doesn't usually afford luxuries, no. It has become quite the destination, hasn't it? My little metropolitan Eden with all the grime and none of the crime. I was advised to charge 100,000 pounds. I said, "no, charge one million." Five days later... I had a six-month waiting list. For 20 million pounds, you could buy one of my beautiful creations, and I sold 17 last year. Of course you have to apply for a license, submit yourself to government monitoring and blah-blah-blah. I didn't know it was legal to have 'em outside the zone. It isn't for someone like you. Mr. Carmichael... My daughter is in zone 414, and I need you to retrieve her for me... Without incident. You see, my Eden is fragile. It may look like a city, but it is as much a construction as the machine standing behind me. People must feel that the place is safe... controlled. Police searching for my troublemaking offspring... Would upset the balance. I need you to bring her back to me. Your original offer was one million pounds. Well, now it's two... 'Cause you are the right fit for this. I can see that. How do you know she's even in there? It is the only place she would go. Hmm. That will get you into the zone. And whatever else you need whilst you're there will be provided for you. And when you get there, find Jane. Who's Jane? Jane might be my best creation. Problematic at times, but, oh, so unique. Melissa was always so fond of her. I would start your search there. Hmm. Well, hello, Jane. How are you feeling? Are you feeling fine? I wanted to see what you're made of, Jane. I would die for you. I'm gonna make you die for me. I'm gonna have to hurt you bad. The veidt corporation cannot be held responsible for any damage to personal property in the zone.

All I want is to feel something real. But I can't control that. Only you can. I do what you want. You make this real. I want to see more of you. Then ask me. Unbutton your shirt. Stop, stop. Leave it there. Just like that. Tell me more about her. Take us away from here. I saw her in an alleyway behind the school, and she was... She was... Smoking a joint. She saw me, she called me over and said that if I promised never to tell anyone, she would let me try. And she did. She let me. On the joint, I could taste her. Mm-hmm. You didn't taste her. You tasted me. I never told anyone I saw you. I know. So I'm a... I'm a good boy. Yeah, you were. You kept our secret. Yeah. Yes. Alpha. Yes, Jane? How many more do I have today? You can remotely access the mainframe and have your... No, I'd like to hear it. Of course, Jane. You have two more appointments today. After my appointments, I want a maintenance session. I look forward to our conversation. Will there be anything else, Jane? No, thank you, Alpha. The veidt corporation cannot be held responsible for any damage to personal property in the zone.

When I'm alone, I like to be alone. Of course. Let me remind you that your special request is in the other room. Good evening, David. Welcome to the zone. I met a man tonight. I can make him want me. Yes, you speak of client 389, Mr. Russell. Mm-hmm. I can... He has requested never to be matched with you again. Why? He was completely satisfied with your encounter. He did not want to ruin the memory of it. You did well. I want to put a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger. Was I programmed to feel that way? Despair, yes. Powerful men are very attracted to those who suffer, to the helpless. Client 389, Mr. Russell, will speak with his friends. They will request you. You will do well with them. There's something else. Someone has been sending me messages. What kind of messages? Voice messages. The voice is distorted, but it's a man's voice. He doesn't tell me his name. What does he say? That he's going to kill me. And you believe that you are afraid. Yes, I believe I'm afraid. I will review these messages. I am certain there is a simple explanation. Yes, someone wants to kill me. Or someone is paying for the ability to make you believe that. You were created to serve the clients, Jane. If a client wants to threaten you, I am certain he is paying to do so. And what if he's paying for the right to kill me? Zone 414 does not allow clients to pay for that experience. Oh, I should mention you will have a visitor tonight. His name is David. The veidt droid 6855 drl firmware. Using veidt corporation's aided and dimensional emulation biotechnology... Any Android malfunction should be reported immediately to the veidt corporation. Hey, you Jane? I'm David. I'm looking for Melissa veidt. Her father sent me. Melissa? Yeah. Can I come in? - What happened to Melissa? - I don't know. That's what her father sent me here to find out. You look uncomfortable, David. Well, you have an apartment. I do. Why does a machine need an apartment? So the machine forgets it's a machine. Nah, I'm good. Not a drinker? I try not to be. The last time I saw Melissa was weeks ago. She used to come here. I found her pretending to be a synthetic. - Why would she do that? - She hates her father. She hates the fact that she's a rich girl who hates her father. She calls herself a cliché. She told me she came here to pretend to be a synthetic because synths don't have to feel anything. So you're a friend of hers, right? Hmm. We had conversations... When she came here. I'm the metal girl who wants to be real, and she's the human girl who wants to be a machine. It's nice and corny. Look, I haven't seen her. I told her to go back to her big house. The last thing I wanted was Roy believing she was a synthetic. Who's Roy? Royale. The meat who manages us, preps us for the clients for purchase. Can you take me to see her? - Me? - Yes. No. See, you asked me. That makes you can't make me. And if you can't make me, then my answer is no. I don't need anymore trouble. I have enough of that. Give it time. Melissa will go home. You said you don't need any more trouble. What kinda trouble? Are we negotiating? If you help me find Melissa, I'll look into it for you. And how exactly can you help me? Depends what's required. Hmm. - Alpha. - Yes, Jane? Play today's messages. Well, hello, Jane. How are you today? I'm feeling fine. I wanted to see what you're made of, Jane. I would die for you. I'm gonna make you die for me. I'm gonna have to hurt you bad. It started a few weeks ago. Now I get one every few days. Sometimes once a day. He's probably a client paying the zone to do it. People have paid to do worse things to me. It'd be good to put a stop to it. Listen, you're the first synthetic veidt made for this place. I'm gonna need your experience, and you're gonna take me to see this Roy, okay? Now that you're telling me, then yes. What? I think you might have a visitor. Lock the door behind me and don't open it till I come back, until you hear my voice, okay? Don't move! I said don't move! Any Android malfunction should be reported immediately to the veidt corporation. Stay right there. Don't fuckin' move. Fuck. He was in my loft? Yeah. I'm not supposed to feel emotions, but I'm terrified. Explain that to me. He's not gonna come back again. He knows I saw him. He'll change what he does. You want me to stay here tonight? Then you can take me to see royale in the morning. - Yes, please. - Okay. You're helping me. Why? That's not why you came to me. No, it's not. Does it matter? I'm just trying to understand you. Well, good luck. Quid pro quo. I need your help. I like to listen to music when I rest. However you do it. Resume playback. Turn it down. Lights. You're almost there. Yes.

Any Android malfunction should be reported immediately to the veidt corporation. Please use our droids responsibly. So veidt has a daughter? Old fucker hid that real well. When did I see this girl? I know it wasn't today. Well, how about where? Where did you see her? I appreciate the fact that Jane is your tour guide, but I don't talk about my life in front of the help. Jane, would you step outside? Did you fuck her? No. Good. Don't trust her. See, veidt won't tell you, but there's something wrong with the way they made her. She doesn't turn off like she's supposed to. She asks questions. Questions she shouldn't want the answers to. Marlon should reprogram her, but he's too proud of what she is. Not for me. You know what I told veidt? I told him he should break her down into tinfoil, but he thinks she's some kind of technological snowflake. Beautiful and unique. When god makes something special, he makes it fragile. When we make something, we want to keep it alive forever. Can we get back to Melissa? Where she is... where she is. I know someone who might know, but I have to prep you for it first. See, I'm the rarefied air here. My world is a brochure. You know what rich people want? No. Everything. I facilitate. There's some ugly in it, but all in all, it's a fine solution to mother nature's fuck-up inside the core of humanity. But it's not the only world here. Some people don't want them pretty. They want the metal. There's a building at the edge of the zone. Here's the address. I'm writing it down because I don't like hearing it in my own voice. I put in a lot of effort trying to pretend that place doesn't exist. That's my tithe to your noble cause. Now I have dreams to fulfill. Someone's been stalking Jane. They were at her apartment last night. So you were at her apartment last night. Jane thinks maybe somebody's paying for the ability to do that, to stalk her. You think I would know about it? Well, you're the rarefied air. I don't get paid to give these sickos what they want. I get paid to keep the world from finding out what these sickos want. I am discretion. If I did know, I wouldn't tell you. But I don't. You trying to save Jane now? Veidt is paying you to find the girl. It's a shit job, so you need the money. Find the girl, get your money and leave. Royale, hi. Someone's coming about the girl. - Yeah? - Yeah. Tell him where she is, and you keep me out of it. Mention me, and I will kill you. Fuck! Melissa veidt? Yeah. Forgive the mood lighting. My skin reacts badly to sunlight. I'm George, and this is Hamilton. Say hello, Hamilton. Hello. And this is our friend, Jaden. She's a little bit shy, I'm afraid. Royale gave me the impression you may know the whereabouts of Melissa veidt. So you've endured a conversation with royale? My condolences. Yes, Hamilton found her at the entrance of the building. She was lost. And I... I thought she was a synthetic. You say she was human? Yeah. She was only here for a few hours. She seemed... Well, she seemed frightened. I didn't ask her why. A young girl turns up on your doorstep frightened, and you didn't ask any questions? When you don't like to answer questions, you quickly learn not to ask any. Ah. She seemed rather... delicate. Damaged. I have a penchant for damaged things, don't I, Hamilton? Your model is lovely. Did Melissa tell you where she was going? They can feel pain, you know. In their own way. Yes. They scream. Did she say where she was going? You haven't asked about my face or how a human has taken up permanent residence in the zone. I have no interest. I'm just trying to find Marlon veidt's daughter. Hmm. Let me think. She did say something about where she was going. Something. Any information would be helpful. Yes, so it would seem. Or perhaps a trade would be in order. I could tell you everything I know about the whereabouts of your Melissa in exchange for one small favor. What kinda favor? Two hours with your model. She's lovely, isn't she, Hamilton? Yes, lovely. You provide me with that, and then I'll tell you where your little girl scuttled off to. Oh, don't worry. I wouldn't do anything too drastic. At least nothing the veidt corporation couldn't repair. I'm not interested in sex, per se. I have slightly more intricate, less obvious interests. Where did Melissa go? - Get her off me! - Where did she go? I tell royale, she'll have you broken down. Not if I kill you. Melissa! Royale gave her to me. I... I didn't know she was human. - What did you do to her? - N... nothing. She... she disappeared. H... Hamilton went to find her, but she'd slipped away. She was gone. The boatyard! The boatyard! - Boatyard. - The boatyard? - The boatyard. - The boatyard! Where's the boatyard? It's at the end of the zone, b... behind the dump. No one ever goes there. That's all I know. Do you know where that is? Get her off me! Get off! Let's go. Get off! I thought you were gonna kill him. I can't imagine you're supposed to be doing that. Melissa? Melissa! You wait here. Mr. Carmichael, were you successful in finding Melissa veidt? Mr. Carmichael? Huh. Well, it seems the matter is resolved. I don't think it's resolved, Mr. Veidt. Melissa is dead. I don't believe she committed suicide. You found her hanging. In an empty shed with nothing to stand on. I've seen suicides, sir. They don't look like this. Oh. I understand. And there will be a trail of evidence... Your services are no longer required, David. We will Bury her and... That will be the end of it. You have a murderer in the zone. There's not been one single act of violence in zone 414 since its inception. That must remain. My clients pay for the absolute certainty of their safety. With all due respect, some of your clients are questionable, and I think they ought to be investigated. Destroying a multi-billion pound empire... Will not bring my daughter back to life. An investigation of the zone will end the zone... And I will not allow that to happen. I also think you ought to investigate some of your employees. Royale, for example. You look, but you do not see, David. David, the man with the name of the second and greatest king of Israel. The giant slayer. Hmm? Are you a man of religion, David? I can't say that I am. Ah! See, I disagree. You have a god. The god of reason. But there is another god. Hmm? The god of power. And for zone 414... I am that god. Do you understand? Can you reach into your working-class mind and see a glimpse of my responsibility? Can you, David? The man with the name of a king who thinks like a soldier. The purpose of a king is not to grieve his Princess. It is to protect his kingdom. You are a small man, David. Hmm. A very small man. And if you have any intention of destroying what I have built, if you stand in the way of the god of power, he will crush you under his heel! I am not a Goliath that you can slay. I am not. I have no intention of destroying what you've built, Mr. Veidt. My daughter is dead. Do you understand that? My daughter is dead! Small men need to be paid too, Mr. Veidt. Of course. Money, money, money. You'll finalize the matter with my brother in the morning. Before you leave tomorrow, the funds will be in your account. Now go. I need to mourn. Just promise me you'll take these feelings away, and I'll give you anything you want. We didn't kill her. Melissa veidt killed herself. All you have to do is choose. Choose to believe that. Choose to put it all down. That's what I do. Just stop thinking and everything will be fine. Be what I want, and I'll take care of you. Don't you want me to take care of you? Can I come in? Yeah. Please don't ask where I've been. You want something to drink? What you're having. I killed Melissa. She snuck into the zone a lot, more than her father knew. I knew who she was, and she made me promise not to tell anyone. I introduced her to Roy, and I didn't tell her she wasn't synthetic. It's my fault, David. You didn't kill her, Jane. Roy might have put that rope around her neck and I... You can't tell Marlon, please. You can't tell him because he'll destroy everyone he knows that was involved. - And Roy, right? - Your master. Mr. Veidt will destroy her too, yeah? Well, I wouldn't be too concerned. Veidt's gonna pretend it didn't matter. I told him already. He's just gonna Bury his daughter and act like nothing happened. So Roy's got nothing to worry about. Your master is safe. Roy is not my fucking master. Yeah. Well, you tell yourself that if it makes you feel more human. It's one of the benefits. Believe as many lies as you want. It's what Melissa did, right? She believed you, yeah? She believed you were her friend, that you're capable of love, more than just a fuckin' robot. She trusted you, and she trusted this place. That's what killed her. You have no right. You can't just come in here and say these things. Can't you see I'm just a fuckin' prisoner here? You know what I see? I see people coming here to avoid their lives. And yeah, you're part of that. But you're not the prisoner, Jane. You're the prison. Carmichael, David Hansen. Served in the marines for three years with an honorable discharge due to injury. Became a police officer, rising to the rank of detective until held accountable for the death of his partner, Henry Franklin. Left the police after a lengthy investigation that would've likely resulted in criminal charges. Current status, freelance investigator. Congratulations. You can access my file. Personal records... Married once to Katherine m. Grant until Katherine Grant, renamed Katherine Carmichael, was found dead in the residence of David and Katherine Carmichael. Cause of death... Self-inflicted overdose of sleeping pills. Previous to her suicide, Katherine Grant was diagnosed as schizophrenic... But was not receiving treatment at the time of her death. Why didn't you treat your wife, David? Do you blame yourself for her death? I believe you do. I see all types of people. They show me parts of themselves they never show anyone. I know things about the meat... And you're the kind that blames himself. You need to get the fuck out. Would you like me to tell you what your fantasy... Your dream is, David? I want you to leave now. You fantasize about being above it all. Above me, above this place. You're living your fantasy. Judging me... Convincing yourself that you're not broken like the rest of us. I can look like her. I can have her red hair. Would you like that? That little fire of guilt you carry, I can help you put it out. There's your fantasy. Being strong enough to tell me no. Did you tell Marlon... That I attacked that man? No. You protected me. Why? You hate me... And you hate everything that I am. Why protect me? Because you're right. That is my dream, protecting, okay? But now I'm awake, and I'm outta here. I'm leaving tomorrow. You can't leave tomorrow. You told me you would stop the person sending me those messages. He's gonna kill me, you know. You know, I actually think maybe that's what you want. You're never gonna leave here. No one's ever gonna purchase you and take you away, and you know that. So death may be the only answer. And they do say it's when you feel most alive. That final moment. I didn't get treatment for my wife 'cause she didn't want me to. She knew she was gonna spend the rest of her life broken, and she... She wanted to leave. So I let her. I bought her those pills. I... I don't understand what you're saying. I'm saying I know what it looks like when somebody wants to die. Thank you for your discretion about Melissa. We buried her this morning. How did you like your time in the zone? Uh. Not my kinda place. The gallant knight finds no home in the city of robots. I admire that. Most people get lost there. Well, a job well done. I'm arranging a transfer of two million into your account as per our terms. You're not wealthy... but you're rich. About the person who murdered your niece... Yes. You suspect royale for that and for stalking Jane. Most rational people would. We will have justice for Melissa, but like everything here, it will be... Unique. Yeah, I'm sure. What can you tell me about her? What do you mean? About who? Melissa. Oh, I wouldn't know where to begin. In many ways, she was my family's conscience. What did you love about her? I beg your pardon? What did you love about her? Let me rephrase that. What did you hate about her? You're being cruel, Mr. Carmichael. You never asked if she suffered. Families usually ask that. Her death was violent. I assume she suffered. Royale's obsessions have always been problematic. Well, royale's a sociopath. Marlon considers that a benefit. She's also a coward... like you. But royale doesn't have to live in her brother's multi-billion pound shadow, does she? Sharing his name and yet being a servant. My brother is a visionary. He leads, we follow. He must be some kinda god. I hope you're getting something in return. I mean, I wouldn't wanna be a loyal subject for nothing. You don't even get to manage his creations, right? That's royale's responsibility, yeah? So apart from paying a few bills... You don't do much at all. I have a role here. I have value. Yeah? Doesn't look like it. Jane's your brother's favorite, right? Marlon's favorite? That's why you stalk her, isn't it? To get to him, to hurt him. Of course, the best way to hurt him would be to murder his daughter. And then you get to watch royale suffer in her judgment, you get to toy with me 'cause I'm just the help... And then you get to feel like you actually do have a... role here... That you do have value, even if you don't. I didn't kill Melissa. And yet we both know you did. I could kill you too. You could try. I want to show you something. It'd be nice to finally show someone. I built this myself. I keep parts of them to remember. My brother pretends they have accidents. He doesn't like to believe someone might be killing them. But you kill people. You know how it feels. Marlon thinks true pleasure lies in creation, but I... I don't. Do you know what I think? I think god found no meaning until he created death. Sweet Melissa. Melissa hated her last name. She... The weight of it just... I... I don't mind it. But she raged against her father and liked to run off into the zone. She felt more kinship with those things than with us. Something I'll never understand. I didn't know she was there. She found me hurting one of them. She was gonna tell Marlon. I couldn't let that happen. You see, it's the cardinal sin. He would never forgive me for that. And you think he's gonna forgive you for killing his daughter? Well, he's never going to know. Why did you hire me? Melissa's story needed a conclusion. I couldn't be the one to find her. The police would make an issue of it and raid the zone. You were my solution. And poor royale... Will have to be the monster that Marlon needs to find. Well... I think that concludes our business, Mr. Carmichael. You do excellent work. If the need arises, I will have no hesitation recommending you in the future. I oughta put you away for a long time. No, I'm not going to prison. My brother won't allow it. And you have no proof. You are not a cop anymore. Besides... You wouldn't get your money, and Marlon... Would make your life hell. So what, you're just gonna keep terrorizing Jane? Well, for a little longer. I... I just love seeing how human she is. And what's more human than fear? Yeah, I might kill her too. If I do... Which part of her should I keep? Perhaps her brain. You can go now. In your opinion, zone 414 is safe. In my opinion, yes. I did not see anything that led me to believe that there is any danger in zone 414. The veidt droid 6855... Hello, Jane. You are afraid. Oh, my. Marlon doesn't know I have one of these. There's a lot my brother doesn't know. Just gives us a little more time together. Keeps you still. And quiet. But I know you can hear me. And I know you can feel me. Dimensional emulation biotechnology. The Android model is capable... Melissa liked you. She thought you were her friend. She didn't realize you can't be anyone's friend because you're a lie. You're my brother's lie. Hmm. My brother didn't miss a detail. Not with you. I feel pain. I feel love. I loved Melissa. I feel hate, and I hate you! I'm alive. I'm alive! I'm alive! No! Jane. Jane? You have a job to do, so do it. I won't stop you. What do you mean? It's okay. I don't wanna live like this anymore. You can set me free. You really wanna be free? Yes. He's Marlon's brother. Yeah, and he killed Marlon's daughter, your friend. It's my gun, Jane, and you don't have fingerprints. It's gonna look like I did it. The only thing that matters is if you can live with yourself. Please, please. Why did you come back? 'Cause I never should have bought my wife those pills. They'll destroy us both now. In my investigation, I was unable to locate Melissa veidt, despite my complete efforts. And yet, upon returning to the veidt estate... I found Melissa there with her father, Marlon veidt, and her uncle Joseph. We have a deal, Mr. Veidt. And I will honor it, David. So Marlon's daughter is alive. As I understand it. A parent's not meant to Bury their children. No. I would like to never see you again. Hmm. Thank you, father. You're welcome, sweetheart. State your name for the record. David Carmichael. That should be sufficient. End the recording. Any attempt to refute any element of this story will be met with every legal resistance, Mr. Carmichael. Even if you engage in legal action, realize it will be your word against the word of Marlon veidt. Yeah, sure. Warning, gate opening. Warning, gate opening. Warning, gate opening.
