So, "the hands..." No, "the monster's horrid claws touched Melissa's body..." "And then..." What are you writing? My new masterpiece Ah.... More filth Full of crime, monsters horror and rape... all that stuff A little respect for art, please. My muse calls... - Fancy the beach? - In this weather? - It's all just water - In this case, cold water Who are you meeting? Just friends Are these friends six foot tall and called Tom? Who? What? Tom? You're mad. See? So predictable Of course, Tom All right, Tom Whatever you want, Tom See you later, Tom - So, was it Tom? - Tom? No. - Why are you lying? - Who says I am? - Spare me - What if it was him? - He's married - I'm not jealous He's a swine, you can tell How can you tell? His eyes But of course All men who look at me are swine, if they don't look at you There's a new theory Tells the character of a man by the colour of his eyes Professor Steiner's theory - How does it go? - The whites of the eye... - Don't laugh, it's true - Of course. You should listen to what I say... That man is a swine. Listen to me, Carole, Tom's a good friend He's really very nice and his wife is too But in your imagination you only see monsters... vampires attacking their victims... howling wolves and ogres and... and fountains of blood. Sadistic perverts, sex maniacs, killers... crime and rape and sleaze everywhere Your ex Naval Officer awaits... "He took her hand..." "and caressed her slowly" Come here, darling. Come and look Look down there It's strange... see? Looks like a woman Let's go and see No, I don't want to... The house on the island... Help me... They're going to kill me To... to kill me. But I... I escaped A man with black glasses... Looking for me... My twin sister had disappeared ...on the island I had to find her My sister was afraid ...of the island... Those rocks... Those rocks.... They warned of death. But I had to go on He wouldn't go any closer I had to swim there Swim to that house Swim all the way to that evil house I was exhausted The place... was silent Deserted Like a cemetery I was afraid I felt I was being watched Watched from up there I was scared to death But I had to go on A couple... A strange couple Count and Countess Zaroff... They live on the island They invited me to... stay with them I became their guest It's delicious, well done Rador - I hope our guest agrees - It's exquisite. Very unusual Different and unique Not for us. We're used to it now My dear wife introduced me to this type of meat Sometimes us women have to push their men to try new things This all seems very mysterious It's a strange feeling What sort of meat is this? Rador... You'll soon find out all about this meat Ivanna will enjoy telling you Isn't that so? It's wild game. I hunt it myself And Rador cooks it Let's have coffee in the lounge Rador has a special blend He's a fascinating man. I can see why you're so in love We share many tastes We enjoy hunting, fine dining and succulent meals It's good to share one's pleasures What are these heads? Aren't they amazing? Do you like them? I'm proud of them and my husband loves them They are great mementos A wild boar from Hungary A bear from Crimea The deer is from Austria... The puma from Llanos The head from Amazonia What is it? What do you want? We want you Take her. Take her. No... Let me go Take her. Harder. Get me the syringe Quiet now. Calm down They wanted.. to kill me. So what now? Take her back to the island? Yes, who's speaking, please? Sylvia, it's for you. - Who is it? - It's Tom Great Yes, I'm waiting... No, I won't hang up Miss Sylvia Aguado, please Orders from the Countess, she wants a new victim Hello, Sylvia. Were you asleep? It's ten already Why not come here for lunch? No, it's not like that We'll expect you then? Yes, we'll talk about that Right, in an hour then That was Tom He's invited me to go with him and his wife... to a rich couple's island You're going? - Sure, why not? - But darling... it's far too risky I don't care Don't be afraid, Bob. I know you're taking a risk... but we've no choice if we want to escape from here Go far away and forget all about this To escape we need money and to get that we need them I just hope it works - So, Sylvia, having fun? - Yes, it's wonderful here You're lucky to live in such a place Nothing to do but lie in the sun... ...breathe the clean air, lulled by the waves You're right But you're staying near the sea, aren't you? Yes, but in a cheap hotel And only for ten days holiday In a horrible room with no view of the sea Listen, Sylvia, I've got an idea... Why don't you move in here? An excellent idea. We can all three have fun together Do you like Bob? Yes, he's a nice chap. That's all? I'm not the jealous type You can tell me But he's your husband That's not a problem. I like him to have fun And sometimes I might even join in What do you mean? Move in here. I want you... I think I love you Forget that nonsense about your hotel Come and live here I can't... You're foolish. Yes, he's foolish. That's why I love him. And you will too Now, stop worrying - Let's go get your things - Alright, but I'll do it I'll be back in half an hour See? That was easy I knew it would be I feel like laughing. She's so stupid What are you up to? Why? I'm going to spend the weekend with friends who know very rich people Who have a wonderful house on a small island out there Apparently with wonderful views You know it could be dangerous? Even deadly. - You think so? - I'm not joking Your lovely couple are eccentrics With strange ideas You don't know anything about their friends And then this island... that you know nothing about Anything can happen on an island Gang rape, sadistic crimes... Oh yes, islands are so dangerous Honolulu, Puerto Rico, The Bahamas, Hawaii What about the island of Dr. Moreau... The island of Fu Manchu, the island of Count Zaroff... I've not been asked to spend the weekend with any of them I want you I need you The touch of you drives me wild. Your skin... so sensual Your lips, so enticing Come, don't leave me alone Sylvia... Come here That's enough, it's my turn now Dirty bitch. I wish we could stay here Come on, get dressed. They're waiting for us Come on, let's go This house frightens me Don't be silly - She's beautiful, isn't she Rador? - Yes, quite charming A real jewel... ...for a collector like me Yes, Sylvia, it's a pleasure for us to know someone so lovely Right, Rador? A great pleasure. You are sweet and tender How old are you, my child? Who cares...? She's here... ...she's a looker. What more do you need? Forgive me, Mr Nubar, I didn't mean to offend you You don't Are you two finished? Listen here... You don't talk to the Count like that He just wanted to know more about our guest - You know we love such details - You bet I know Please, Bob, don't be so rude Bob is a man with strong passions Had his education been as strong, he'd be perfect I don't bear grudges. And to prove it... Here's the best piece of meat Keep it, I don't want it Control yourself I'm sorry, he's not been himself these last days So I see. Maybe you should leave Your illness might prove dangerous I'll be fine now Poor Bob, he struggles with the pleasures of the flesh That's it, I'm off. I want no part of your vile orgies Shame, he's usually such a sweet boy Yes, he's very sweet Do you like our favourite meat, Sylvia? Don't ask the sweet girl to lie. This meat is rather tough Not up to our usual standard But next time... Sorry - you won't be here Why? It's likely - Am I upsetting you? - On the contrary Just that you will have already left by the time we start cooking Oh yes, that's a fact Already left, indeed It's so lovely here Yes, it is... Spectacular But I prefer... the beauty of the human body I didn't hear you come in I thought you might need something to wear in bed Thanks. But... where's Moira? Is she asleep already? Yes. She was very tired She's quite delicate Is that a problem? Yes, because I really like her - You'd like to play with her? - We already have I'll do my best to help you forget Moira I'll be back once Rador is asleep Sylvia, what are you doing? Leave her be, my dear. She's curious like all children You know, it's no easy task to cut off a human head It's hard work Come, my dear Come and help us A fine trophy... for my little collection But it's monstrous... How could you...? We'll keep the rest of her body She's magnificent. Her flesh will be so tender Moist... Her breasts are superb They're my favourite parts You eat human flesh? Of course And so do you That meat you enjoyed so much, it was human flesh You're completely insane. It's horrible Come, my child, don't upset yourself. Reject nothing that gives pleasure Don't be so conventional. Admit you enjoyed the meal She's dim, but she's certainly juicy I think we're going to have fun, my dear Yet another fine feast day It'll soon be dawn Why prolong my torture? I know what you want You want to kill me Put my head next to those... ...those other poor innocents That would be too easy And far too cheap for us. We're artists You have no conception of the nobility of certain emotions I, Countess Zaroff, am incapable of killing in cold blood I love the hunt... The game of life and death I always give my prey a chance to escape At dawn we shall let you loose Exactly ten minutes later, my sweet, I will hunt you down with my bow If we have not caught you when the church clock strikes 9... You will be free And I myself will take you back to dry land These are the rules of the game. Or else... Or else you become a tender and succulent roast for our table The birds are already singing. It is dawn... Let it begin Murderers.... Did it go well? Very well. We'll get 2 million for her Why? I'll call the police. You hear me? I'll do it... I don't think you'll do that You're involved in this too I've waited for this moment so long, my love For me, you will be the best meal of my life Wake up, Sylvia. You're alright? You're not hurt? You're sure? What happened? What...? I was so afraid I read in the newspaper... a girl was found on an island, shot by an arrow But that wasn't me Look, I'm fine You spent the weekend with them? Well... No This time I realised you were right - That man is a swine. - Oh, I'm so happy I really like you, Sylvia Really?
