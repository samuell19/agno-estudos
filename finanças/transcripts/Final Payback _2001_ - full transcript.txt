(dramatic music) - [Man] To serve and protect, words to live by, that is, until you find yourself on the wrong side of the law. I was pushed over the fence. Then things went from bad to worse. I suppose it didn't help that I found myself with the wrong woman at the wrong time. (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) (alarm beeps) - Someone turn that damn thing off, please. (alarm beeps) Oh. (alarm beeps) Jeez. What happened last night? (alarm beeps) Looks like we had a good time, at least. (alarm beeps) Hey, Sharon. (alarm beeps) Sharon, you up? (alarm beeps) I am, now. (alarm beeps) Hey, Sharon. (alarm beeps) (suspenseful music) (alarm beeps) Sharon? (alarm beeps) Sharon? (suspenseful music) Sharon? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (sirens blare) (dramatic music) (engine revs) (dramatic music) (tires squeal) (sirens blare) (dramatic music) (tires squeal) (explosion) (car crashes) (engine revs) - Hey, Joey, what's up? - Hey, you got my key? - Yeah, sure thing, man. Here it is. - Thanks. - Hey, you don't look so good, man. (blades whirring) - I'm here live at the home of police chief George Moreno where a horrible crime has rocked this quiet community. A woman was found beaten and stabbed to death by an intruder. There are no leads at this time or suspects, police chief is just pulling up right now. Police Chief Moreno, do you have any information at all? - No comment. - Is there any truth to the rumor that the deceased is actually your wife? - No comment. - Do you have nothing to share with us? You must know something. (birds chirping) - Sir, you shouldn't be here right now. - It's Sharon. - Yes, sir. - Oh God, no. Why? Why? What have they found? - Well, a butcher knife appears to be the murder weapon and the first officer arrived on the scene saw a suspect, but he got away, sir. - My wife's murderer got away? - We have an accurate description, sir. (dramatic music) - I'll be damned. It's Randall. (water running) (dramatic music) - Sharon's dead. I still can't believe it. It's like one hell of a nightmare. I must be on the cop's most wanted list. (dramatic music) What the hell happened last night? (dramatic music) I know I didn't do it. I couldn't have. But the blood... The knife... (dramatic music) (door creaks) (dramatic music) Whoa, what the hell you doing sneaking up on me like that? - Sneaking up on you? I thought you'd still be out doing the chief's wife. Still think you're out of your mind, man, there's a lot of women out there you should be doing. - Shut up, Steve, all right, just shut up. - Okay. What's up with you, man? Hey, man, you're starting to scare me. What's going on? - I'm gonna need your help, Steve. I'm in real deep shit. I'm in real deep shit, shit, shit. Sharon's dead. - What? What are you talking about, man? - I found her lying on the ground in the shower, then I-- - Slow down. Just tell me what's going on, calm down. - We're having a great time. We're partying and we both got a little wasted, and then I woke up in the morning and I went upstairs and she was dead. - Did you see anything, did you hear anything? - Nothing, nothing. Then the cops showed up and I ran. - Cops, who called the cops? - I don't know who called the cops. I didn't stick around to find out, Steve. - So you ran, what are you, crazy? You ran? - Yes, I ran, I ran. I panicked. - Okay, look, man. If you didn't do anything, go turn yourself in. - That's easy for you to say. You're not the one who found himself with the police chief's dead wife, and whatever I do, they're gonna nail me. They're gonna nail me. - What are you talking about? That old riff with you and James? Man, that was four years ago. Don't sweat that. - Steve, that doesn't mean shit. - Okay, look, man, well, you can't stay here. I'll see you through this, man. Okay, like you did for me. - I didn't do anything. - The hell you didn't, man. Got me off the streets, you cleaned me up. I'll never forget that. - Well, what did you expect? - Why don't you get yourself a hotel somewhere else. Take the money. I'll keep an eye on this place. We'll see what happens and just call me, okay? Whoa, whoa, man, hey. Come on, man. There's enough heat going on here. We don't need that. Here, put your jacket on. Into a hotel, call me, okay? - All right. - Go, go, go, go. (engine revs) (horns honk) - Gina. Look, listen, Gina. - Look, buster, I'll give you five seconds to clear out. - Look, Mary, I have to-- - You don't have to nothing. Just get your butt out of here. - She's right, Joey. We have nothing to talk about. It's over. - For like two years, now, what? You need an escort. I can get Juan and the boys to help you. - Gina, I just gotta talk to you and I can't talk to you here. Gina, don't do this. - What is it that you don't understand here? You can't be this stupid. She's finally getting over your sorry little ass. She's engaged, remember? And I like him. Leave her alone. - It's okay, Mary, I can handle this. - Honey, you'll never learn. What the hell you wanna talk to him for? - I'll just be a minute. Handle my station, okay? - Oh, yeah, sure, right, right. What the hell do I know? Nothing. - Joey. Should have called. - I know I should have called. (lighter sparks) - The things are gonna kill you. - I know, but today's not a good day to quit smoking. - How much do you need? This is all I got. I'm barely making ends meet. - Gina, it's not about that, all right? I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. - So what else is new? What is it this time, a jealous husband? Your loan shark, a bookie? - I'm in serious trouble. (engine revs) Cops are after me. - Oh, Joey, what did you go and do? - I can't tell you, it was just... - Just what, Joey, things aren't going so hot for Joey right now? So you might as well go back to good old Gina? I've known you for what, six, seven years? We had a good thing, Joey, but it just wasn't meant to be. - Gina, you're... You're the only one I've ever really cared about. - Don't start that again, Joey. You might have cared for me but you are married to your job, and when you left the force, you went from bad to worse. You became a different person. - Look, being a police officer is the only thing I knew how to do, that was it. - I know, Joey. But I needed more than a part time boyfriend. I needed a real commitment. (dramatic music) - I know. Look, I'mma go, okay? - Joey, just need a little time, okay? Things are different for me, now. - Look, all I need is a place to crash just for a couple nights, just a couple nights. - Last time you said that, we ended up shacking up for six months. - It's different this time. It's really different. - Gotta get back to work. Joey, only for a few days. - In an update to today's earlier broadcast, police now have a suspect in the brutal slaying in Orange County. The suspect is ex-police officer Joseph Randall. Joseph Randall is five feet 11, Caucasian and weighs approximately 170 pounds. Randall was fired from the force four years ago in what was described as a crack down on corruption. For Channel 60 news, I'm Ellen K. - Going on? - Honey, you stay away from that pig. He's the main suspect in a murder. I ever see his face come around here again, I'm calling the cops myself. - Randall. - 313. (dramatic music) - Freeze, put your hands up, now. Put your hands up now. Hey, get up. Hands right where I can see 'em. (dramatic music) - Man, what do you guys want, I haven't done anything. - He's not here. - Where's Joey Randall? - I haven't seen him in days, man. - Really, listen. We're gonna find out sooner or later, so why don't you make this real easy on yourself, tell us what you know and then we won't take you in. I don't know anything, my friend. - Really? - No. - In that case, get out. You are under arrest for aiding and abetting a murder suspect. - Ow, that's tight, man. - You have the right to remain silent. - You know I've heard-- - Anything you say can and will be used in a court of law. - I've heard that before. - God, why did she have to die so violently? - What was Randall doing at your house, anyway? - Isn't that obvious? - It was her own fault. - Don't talk about her like that. - I'm sorry, George, I wish things were different, but we definitely know it was Randall. - I want him dead. - George, we cannot have cops killing cops. - Randall is no damn cop. - There's too much heat on the department, now, George. Why don't you take some time off? I'll take care of it. - Did you check the surveillance cameras? - Surveillance cameras? - I have surveillance cameras operating at my house 24 hours a day. I wanted to know what my wife was doing while I was gone. - That's very visionary of you, George. - Wasn't it? - I'll check with the crime scene people. - Hey, Joe, Joey, come here. - What? - Hey, man, what'd you get yourself into, man? The cops were here looking for you. - How long ago did they leave? - I don't know, about three hours ago. Hey, they arrested your partner. - What? - Yeah, man, they told me if I see you to give them a call. I mean, you're my bro, man. I wouldn't snitch on you or anything, but things have been a little tight around here. - How 'bout 10 bucks? - These were big cops, man. They were tough. - All right, how 'bout 20 good reasons not to call 'em? - You were never here. - Never here. (dramatic music) (punches landing) (dramatic music) - You're not here. Where is it? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Really? (punches landing) (dramatic music) Stop messing around. We know you have it. Tell us where you hid it? - What the hell? I don't know what you want. (punches landing) (dramatic music) - Maybe if we start carving off some fingers you'll know where it's at. Take him over there. (punches landing) (dramatic music) (sirens blare) - Hope you have some good news for me. - He got away from us again, sir. You ever try and take someone down that knows that they're the target? - Do you think I got this far with excuses? - No, sir, but this Randall guy, he's a pro. - All right, I'll go outside. - Captain, I don't think that's a very good idea. - You are not paid to think unless you know how to operate my new phone? - No, sir, I don't, but I know that I can handle Randall. - I will take care of this myself. (phone beeps) This thing is broken. - Think you could have gotten it just a little closer. Captain, hey, Captain James. You got a minute? - For you, sir, of course. - New phone? (phone rings) - Yeah. - Old phone. Sorry, gotta take this. Hello? Why can't we do it as we planned? I don't care. What time? Okay, I'll be-- Yes, I'll be there. I will be there. Thank you. - Bad news? - No, just some fund raising dog and pony show, you know. Shake a few hands, kiss a few babies. I hate these things. - You wanted to be mayor. - I know, I know, I just wish I could get to the business of running the city and not have to deal with all this political hog wash. Listen, how's George doing? - He's a survivor, sir, he'll do find. - Good. I don't want this to sound too crass, but you think he's gonna be up to making the rally? - He'll be there, sir. - Good, good, 'cause I got a lot riding on this and I'm counting on it. The polls are showing that I'm just a little behind. - If you don't mind me saying, you should never believe the polls. - That what I like about you, Captain James. You are the eternal optimist. - Well, sir, we need you in office as much as you need us protecting the streets. - Well, now there's a campaign slogan if I ever heard one. Hey, where's my latte? Just make sure everything runs smooth as... - Oil. - Baby oil. (men chattering) (punches landing) - Still look like you're in shape, Chapman. - What are you doing here? - I was doing some digging and I found that you still owed the state some time. - I did my time. - That's your problem. All I needed then was some information. - I'm no snitch. - You still belong to me and I figure you owe me 30 years. Hey, you're forgetting I'm a cop. (punches) - Then act like one. - Let's talk. - Nothing to talk about. I told you, I'm retired. - You retire when I tell you to retire. - Think you better leave. (dramatic music) - It would be a real shame if you were to go back to the joint. I mean, who would take care of little Angelica, huh? (dramatic music) Be smart. Do the job. (dramatic music) Do the job. (dramatic music) It'll be good and better for her health. (slaps) (dramatic music) - [Randall] All along I made some really bad choices, knowing that sooner or later they would catch up with me. (dramatic music) It would have been so easy to keep my mouth shut the other way. It all happened so fast, just like a blur. One minute, I'm arresting a perp, the next I... (dramatic music) - How's it going, buddy? - You again. Look, I didn't do anything, man. - Yeah, yeah. - What gives you the right to jack me up, huh? - My gun, my badge, and the sweet love of Jesus right here, pal. - You're mine, pig. - This is punk who blasted Jimenez last week. - I didn't shoot anybody. What, are you pigs trying to frame me, huh? I know my right. Get the cops off me. - Are you sure about this, captain? - His face is plastered all over the tube. - I was Jimenez's best man at his wedding. - [Smith] Jesus. - He didn't deserve to die like that. He didn't deserve to die like that. - I gotta get back to the mayor's house. Why don't you let Smith take it from here? You go 1098. - I got him. - You earned it. - Thanks, Captain. - You ain't so tough, now, are you punk? - [Officer] What the hell's he doing? - Okay, it's okay, it's okay, come on. - You piece of trash. Come on. - Captain, we got him dead to rights. - Yeah, look, Jimenez was one of our own, right? - Yeah. - He had a wife and two kids. Don't worry. I'll put you in for commendation. - Commendation for what? - Collaring a cold blooded killer. - Yeah, but captain-- - Come on, come on, you know what would have happened if we would have taken this punk down town. He would have got some public defender to say that we violated his civil rights, and then some jury of bleeding hearts would have freed him on some technicality. What about Jimenez's rights? Didn't he have a right to live? - Of course he did. But that doesn't give us the right to go break laws we're supposed to uphold. - I spent 15 years on the streets and I can't tell you how many times I arrested punks only to find them freed with a slap on the wrist. - Captain-- - It didn't matter, pedophiles, murderers. (grunts) One day I get home and... My wife had been raped. And the rapist, the rapist was someone that I had just busted. (dramatic music) He too almost beat the system. (dramatic music) That's how it goes, isn't it. (gun fires) - Christ. Jesus Christ. - All right. He was armed and Smith was just defending himself. - No, Captain, no. He was handcuffed and he was unarmed. He was unarmed. I gotta report this. I'm sorry, I gotta report this. - Let's go around. (dramatic music) (engine revs) (dramatic music) - But your captain told me how you heroically apprehended that killer. I understand that this is a totally justified shooting. - I didn't shoot him. He was unarmed. I had him handcuffed when James and his thug came in. It was Smith that killed him, sir. (dramatic music) - Are you asking me to believe that a police captain and a highly decorate lieutenant are covering up a crime? That's a very serious accusation. - I realize that. - Why don't you rethink what you remembered. We don't want to destroy the careers of two good men unnecessarily. - They killed him in cold blood. - Listen, Randall, do you really care if there's one less undesirable on the streets of the city? You have a long career here. That's what's important. Don't rock the boat. (dramatic music) I'm sorry you feel this way. - So am I. (horn honks) (dramatic music) (cars driving) (siren blares) - Back so soon? - Yeah, I'm back, all right. (punches) - Damn, fuck you hit me for? - You know why, asshole. Don't be pulling that shit. - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah? - Go ahead. Shoot me. The second that bullet hits my brain I'm gonna jerk back and cut off your nuts, whoops. - Come on, come on, now. You know how it is. I'm having some problems with my accounting. It's been hard lately to handle my business. - The next time you shortchange me, I'm gonna take what balls you have left and shove 'em down your neck, okay? Now pay me. - Hey, you sure you don't want some merchandise on credit, on credit? - Come on, just give me the money. No, I don't want that shit. Give me my money. Come on. Get a fucking lighter, too. - No. - Give me that. (cars driving) - Cody, Cody, Cody come back here. Cody, I warned you. Nobody works my streets without my permission. Huh? - Ow. I'm sorry, man, I forgot. I forgot, man. - Yeah, yeah. - I forgot, but look, you know I didn't mean to cross you, man, I didn't, no. I'm sorry, man. - Let's clean you up a bit, man, I want you to look good for your girls. Get out of here. - Okay, thanks. Thanks. - Hey. I want you to crawl there. - Say what? - On your knees. - Okay, all right, thanks. (footsteps echo) - Okay, hands behind your neck, you know the drill. Come on. (siren blares) - Come on, come on, quit, James. You know I get paid good money for that shit. - That's what I like about you, Tommy. No bull shit. - Yeah, life's too short. - I need you to do another special favor for me. - No, no way, I'm not, no. I can't. - Hey. Since when did you get so pious? - Only... They found my kid last week. I've been spending some time with him. He's so good looking. - Yeah. - You know, when I went in, I didn't know if I'd ever get to see him again, and I'm trying to put all that behind me now, you know, I'm trying to change. - Honey, people like you and me never change. - Fuck you. (dramatic music) - I need you to do me this favor. If you do, I'll make sure you see your kid permanently. No strings. (dramatic music) - No, I told you, I can't. - Well, then I'll have to arrest you. - For what? - For starters, possession of cocaine. Possession of a gun that's been used in a series of crimes. For this and for that. - Come on, James, you can't do this to me. If I go back there, they'll kill me. They'll kill me, James. (dramatic music) - Do we have a deal? (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Good show, Revus. (suspenseful music) Okay, you're just gonna ignore me, I see. I see some things never change, okay? You don't want to deal, what? What's going on? It's too hot for you? - Get out. - Okay, I feel like we're making some progress here. At least you're actually talking to me. - I don't need this right now. - I don't care what you need. That son of a bitch came back after me. - So you're in, too. - What do you think? He was the last person I ever wanted to see again, and you're the second to last. - Well, obviously, we don't have a choice. - Obviously. - But I'm gonna tell you this. Just one time. Do not mess this up. Or you'll be the first person I cap. - Don't threaten me. - Hey, hey, I don't give a shit what you do. Whether you use your needle, whether you free base, or you pack your pretty little nose with that powder. Just don't screw this up, you got it? - Ooh, big man Revus, huh? You like threatening me, huh? You're a big man, threatening me, huh? Where were you balls when James threatened you, huh? Where was your bad ass then. You ain't so bad, Revus, you ain't shit. (ominous music) (keys clatter) - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't want to get you involved, Gina. - Well, it's too late for that. It's all over the news. - I didn't do it. - Then who did? - I don't know. But whoever it was showed up at my place the other night and he was looking for something and tried to kill me. - This is crazy, Joey. This time you're in way over your head. What are you gonna do now? - Try to find a way to get back in the house, see if I can find something, anything. - How do you know there's anything there? - I got a good feeling. - Oh. Forgot about that famous intuition of yours. You can't do it alone. You need help. - Gina, I don't need anybody's help. - There's always a problem with you, Joey. The more I tried to get close to you, the more you pushed me away. - I suppose he's different. What's his name? - Jeremy. Jeremy Benson. (dramatic music) - So how long you been seeing him? - About a year. He's a really sweet guy. We're gonna get married in June. - Married. (dramatic music) I'm happy for you. - Joey. Even though it's over between us, I still wanna help you. - Gina, I... (dramatic music) I've never stopped loving you. - No, Joey, please. It still hurts. - I never meant to hurt you. - It never would have lasted. (dramatic music) - I know. I know. (dramatic music) - Joey. Do you remember Uncle Sal? - Who? - Sally boy. He might be able to help us. - Yeah, but Gina, he hates me. - No, he doesn't hate you. He's just a little sore at you, that's all. You know him, he's harmless. - [Man] Hey, come on, Sal, take it easy. It's not just me we're dealing with here. There are other people I have to answer to. - Listen, I'll break their legs and stuff them into a meat grinder, you got that? - [Man] Yeah, but-- - Where was I? Let me tell you something. You tell those bastards I'm not giving them another penny and they're gonna have to reconsider. Now you understand that? Or I'll close their shop down. - Mr. Duponzo, this is not the 40s, and you are not Capone. We just don't do business that way anymore. - Is that right? Mel, pull over. - What are you doing? - Let me tell you something, if this was the Capone era and I was Capone, I'd be redecorating the inside of this limo with your brains, you got that? - Mr. Duponzo, you misunderstood, you see, I didn't mean to imply that you weren't Capone, like Capone. - Listen to me, you go back and you tell your people either they're gonna turn around and be more reasonable or I'm gonna close their shop down, now get the freak out of my car. (engine revs) (phone rings) (speaking foreign language) - Uncle Sal, it's Gina. (speaking foreign language) - My love, how are you? - I'm fine, just fine. I'm calling because I have a problem. - Who do you want me to kill this time? Only kidding, love. - It's Joey. - Oh, man, you're hanging around with that broken down police again? - It's not like that, Uncle Sal. He's in trouble. I wanna help. - All right, sweet heart, meet in the car about an hour. - Thank you, Uncle Sal. I love you. (speaking foreign language) - My love, goodbye. - Hi, baby, how you doing? Look at you. You're so pretty. You know what, Daddy has to go do something. - Yeah. - And I'll be back real soon, okay, I promise. Daddy always keeps his promises, right? - Right. - Okay. (dramatic music) Go play with Daniel and Jasmine, okay? (dramatic music) - No. No, Miguel, you promised. - Baby, please. (dramatic music) Dora, please, don't make this harder than it already is. This won't take long. - The last time you said that, I didn't see you for seven years. You don't know what it's like for me every night you're not here, wondering if you'll ever come back. - Baby, it's not like before. It's not like when I used to go out with my homeboys, it's not like that. - Just tell me why. Why, Miguel? (dramatic music) - James. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - Hey. (upbeat music) What can I get you? - I'll have a beer. - Yeah, how 'bout you? - I'll have the same as her. - Coming right up. - I don't feel comfortable in this place. I feel like a sitting duck. - Uncle Sal said for us to wait. We can trust him. - Look, it's not Uncle Sal I'm worried about, it's everyone else, okay? It's not a good place. (upbeat music) - Hey, stay put till I give the word. - Screw you, Revus, who died and made you king? - Cheers. - You don't hit on me, anyway. Oh, I know, you don't like the ladies, huh? - You're no lady, just sit down and shut your mouth. - What are we waiting for? Let's just go do this, man, let's get out of here and get it over with. (upbeat music) - Give me that shit. - Oh, okay, like I don't have more. - Hey, we don't make a move till we find out if he has it, you understand. - Yeah, yeah, I got it. I just think he needs to be a little motivated, you know, like I should go over there and give him a little nudge. - Just shut your mouth, I said. - There you go again. I don't like it when men boss me around. The last guy that did that, ended up shy one testicle, okay? (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Jeez, I can't believe what these fuckers did to this place. Would you please help those people, get 'em out of here. Look, Gina, baby, what did I tell you? Broken down police is nothing but trouble. I've been trying to tell you that for the longest time, darling. - This is not my fault-- - Man, am I talking to you? Why don't you shut up. Look, sweetie, he's like the plague, man. Isn't bad enough that he turned around and he was banging the police chief's wife, but my crew brings me back the word on the street that he whacked her also. Well, did you whack her? Answer me. - No, all right, no, I didn't whack her. - Listen to me, there are more powerful people out there that are looking to set you up. Word on the street is, not only did you kill her, but you took something more valuable than she was, and they're gonna get it back. - Who are they? - You know, you're a bigger jerk than I thought you were. Two hired guns, they come out there to kill you, man, whatever you got, whatever they think you got, they're gonna get it back. - Uncle Sal, can you help us? - Gina, my love, you've been in our family, you know what I am, this was the old days, I'd take them out myself, but honey, there's a truce out there. I have no choice but to honor that truce. My biggest concern is you, getting in the way of a stray bullet that's meant for this jerk off. That would destroy me. That would destroy me if that happens. Listen to me, man, let me tell you something. I am holding you responsible for her. You understand what I'm telling you? - Yes and no. - Get out of here before the police come. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) My love, take care of yourself. (punches) - You learned your lesson, boy? Punk? You will learn. - You want to tell us what your friend Randall took from Mrs. Moreno after he did her in? Come on, he's your friend, he must have told you something. - Go to hell. (punches) - He's not gonna talk. - You know, these are my new gardening gloves, I use 'em to weed out undesirable growths near my sun flowers. - I don't know anything. - Oh. Wrong answer. Think about it. Think about it. - You know, one thing about scum like this, you can always depend on their weaknesses. Hey, you remember this. Huh? Have his mouth, please. - Sure. - There we go. Yeah. Come on, tell me, you're the expert. Is it pure, huh? Now that look. - Yeah, it's always this. - No, no, no. Ooh, this might be the reason, his head please. - My pleasure. - What is this, huh? Can you remember something right now? (grunting) Look at him. You're perking up already. - Yeah. - Asshole. (grunting) You son of a bitch. You got nothing on me, man, by the time I get out of here, I'll just report-- - Hey, hey, hey. You gotta remember one thing. I'm never gonna let you out of here. But if you tell me what I wanna know, that door stays open and I just might forget all about you. (grunting) I guess we're gonna have to send him back to crack street. - Please don't do this to me. I've been clean for two years, man. Please. - Do we have a deal? Do we have a deal? (phone rings) - Hello? - Steve. - Steve. Hey, man, I heard you got arrested. Are you all right? - [Steve] Yeah, I'm all right. Man, you were right about James. He's got it bad for you, man. You gotta watch your back. - Listen, man, I'm gonna need some help. - [Steve] What, bro? Be right over. - All right. (dramatic music) - Hey, bro, hey, Gina. - Jesus, what happened to you? - It's nothing, man. - What do you mean, nothing? You look like shit. - Let it go, man. So where we going? - We're going back to the Moreno house. - What we going back there, for? - I don't know, I just got this feeling about that place. - You're intuition, again. - Let's go. (dramatic music) (dog barks) (dramatic music) Wait right here, all right? (dramatic music) What are you doing, wait right here. - No way. - Look, I've already gotten in enough trouble as it is, all right, I don't want anything to happen to you. - I'm coming with you, Joey. That's all there is to it. (dog barks) (dramatic music) - [Steve] Gina, Gina, take the flashlight, here. (dramatic music) (phone rings) - [James] Yeah? - I just dropped them off at Moreno's house. - [James] Both of them? - Yeah. - [James] Get your ass out of there. - You're not gonna hurt 'em, right? Right? - [James] Get out of there now. (dramatic music) (dog barks) (engine revs) (dramatic music) (owl hoots) (dramatic music) - You have your own key? - Yeah, it's a long story. (dramatic music) (keys jingle) (dramatic music) (woman laughing) - You know what? He doesn't know anything about us. Would it be okay if like, we didn't talk about George anymore? You always know how to shut me up, don't you, Joey? (woman laughing) Come on. Come on. Come on, Joey. Come on. Don't be coy, right? (woman laughing) Come on. Come on. (dramatic music) - What's wrong? (dramatic music) - Nothing, I just... (dramatic music) Everything's coming back to me, that's all. - I don't wanna rush you but do you have any idea when he's coming back? Or where this thing you're looking for might be? I'm getting a little nervous. - It could be anywhere. It could be anything. Just look for something unusual or odd. (dramatic music) (insects chirping) (dramatic music) - Do you know the mirror only reflects the way others see us? The way we're expected to behave, forced to behave. Hardly ever the way that we really are. Do you believe that mirrors have secrets? - Why would they have secrets? I don't know. - You don't know? - No, I don't. - Well, they do. - They do? - They really, really do. (woman laughing) - [Joey] So what kind of secrets do they have? - She who communicates her secret to a man makes herself feel the slave. (woman laughing) (dramatic music) Now that mirror, look. The mirror holds the key to my freedom. (dramatic music) (woman laughing) - The mirror. (dramatic music) - What does it have to do with anything? (dramatic music) - The mirror holds the key to her freedom. (dramatic music) This must be what everyone wants? - How do you know? (dramatic music) - I don't, I don't. - It's about time. (dramatic music) - The tape, Randall. - Look, even if I give you this tape, you're still gonna kill us. - You don't have any choice. (dramatic music) (insects chirping) (dramatic music) - Damn. (insects chirping) (dramatic music) - Gina, do you have a video camera? (dramatic music) Gina, I'm sorry I'm brought you into this. - Everything was going so good for me, Joey. I was engaged to be married, everything was perfect. - It's gonna be okay. - No, it's not gonna be okay. I shouldn't even be doing this. - Look, Gina, everything's gonna be fine. - I love you, Joey. I don't wanna lose you. - Everything's gonna be all right. We're never gonna be apart, I promise you. - Don't make any promises you can't keep. - Okay. (door opens) - Thank God you guys are okay. - Where the hell were you? We were looking for you. - I know, I was... - It's okay. Hey, where were you? - I didn't wanna get the neighbors suspicious, so I went around the block a couple times, and the next time I came back, you guys were gone so I just, I split. - You all right? - Yeah. - Okay. - Hey, hey, hey, look at this. - What happened? - Get out. I was here, I decorated it. I found this house. Why is it-- - That's a video from the security camera. - Write all the things that you can expect to get. Come on, I wanna see what you were expecting to get out of this marriage. Now that you're divorcing me. - [Sharon] You're gonna give me what I want, George. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Or what? Or what? - Or a little birdy's gonna go to the DA and he's gonna tell 'em how you know about James and his little band of rogue cops. - What are you talking about? - [Sharon] And how you gave them carte blanche. - [George] I don't understand what the hell you're talking about. - And how all those in policy killings are really cold blooded murders? - Now, look. - No. - You're usually stupid. - Don't yell at me. - But you're extra stupid. - [Sharon] Don't call me stupid anymore. - Here you go again. - And don't play stupid. Don't play that you don't even know what I'm talking about because you know damn well that James is killing those suspects. - Go take some morphine. - He's killing 'em. - Dammit, this is gotta stop. I don't know how far Sharon will go. - [James] We've got to Smith and my guys in the department. - I know that but I can't keep justifying all these police shootings. - George, George, it's my methods that have kept you in office. Just take it easy. Calm down and we'll work something out. - What if the mayor finds out. I'm telling you, I can't stand this any longer. Sharon has gotten out of hand. (phone rings) If Sharon exposes you, we're all finished. (phone rings) - You know Moreno's almost ready to crack. - This divorce is killing him. Suddenly his wife has become a thorn in my side. - So when do you want me to take care of her? - Very soon. (dramatic music) But very clean. (dramatic music) - James killed Sharon. That's why they want that tape so bad. - I gotta go, Joey. (dramatic music) This is scaring me, brother. I gotta get out of here. - All right, okay. Listen, just watch your back, okay? 'Cause they can be trailing all of us. - Don't worry about it. - Okay. - Joey, there's something about Steve's... - Don't even go there, okay? Steve's like a brother to me. I trust him as much as I trust you. - Okay. So now what are we gonna do about this mess? There must be someone we can talk to, the FBI, the state police, I don't know. - Gina, I can't trust anybody, and the safest place for you right now is staying at Boyd's place. - Oh, no, you expect me to leave you alone in this mess? - Look, if we're together, it puts you in danger. - I don't care. (dramatic music) - You know, you're very stubborn, Gina. - I know. - Yeah. - It's part of my charm. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (suspenseful music) Gina? Gina? (suspenseful music) Gina? Gina! (suspenseful music) Oh. Don't, please. (suspenseful music) - Got you, bitch. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) Why didn't you shoot? (suspenseful music) Hello? (suspenseful music) - [Joey] Christ, Gina's gone and it's all my fault. She didn't deserve to die. It should be me lying there and not her. I've got to do something. I need some time to think. Dammit, I need time to think things through. (dramatic music) - Shit. - What? He got away again? What about the tape? I mean, sooner or later, Randall's gonna wind up right on the front steps of internal affairs. - Sooner or later, he's gonna wind up a memory just like... - Just like my wife. - George, we need to be focusing on Randall. - Peter, did you kill Sharon? - No. - This has gone too far. This has got to end. - It'll end when we find Randall. - The tape isn't worth all this. It's all talk. There's nothing there that'll implicate you to the shootings. There's nothing there they can prove anything, unless there's something I don't know about. - The only thing on the tape is your argument with Sharon and her wild absurd accusations. Relax, George. (dramatic music) - Hey, Joey. - Hi. - [Steve] I'm glad to see you're okay. What's going on? - Why wouldn't I be okay? (dramatic music) - I don't know, with everything that's been going down, I thought maybe something might-- - Something, maybe something, what? I trust you with my life, Steve, and now Gina's dead, she's dead. - What? You don't understand, Joey. It's not like that, okay? - Why did you set me up? Why? - I didn't mean to, man. James gave me his word, man. He said that all he wanted was the tape. - Gina died because of this tape? How could you do this? Look at me. You and me were like family. Like family, you know what that means? - I had no choice, okay? He got me fucking hooked again, and then I had to-- - You had to what? You had to set me up? You were like my brother, my brother. - Man, I wasn't like your brother, man. I was a junkie, man, you were a cop. Joey, I-- - You betrayed me, you betrayed me. - I didn't betray you, man, I'm sorry. It wasn't me. - Who did the shooting? - It wasn't me, it was the dope, man. - Wrong answer, wrong answer. Who did the shooting? - I didn't want it. - Who killed Gina? - It was, I think he hired, I think there was two ex-cons. He hired two ex cons-- - Name, Steven, names. - There was one guy named Revus and then there was this chick that he called Tonya, but that's all I remember, man. (dramatic music) Please, man, you gotta forgive me, man. I'm all fucked up, you don't understand. - Let me just tell you something. - [Steve] You got it. - When I said I thought you were my brother, I did. - I am your brother, man. - But you know what? - I am. - My brother just died, my friend. - [Steve] No, man. - My brother just died. - No. I didn't... I didn't know what I was doing, man. You gotta forgive me. (dramatic music) (crying) (suspenseful music) - No, Joey, man. Look, Joey. I didn't know what they were gonna do, man. I didn't know what they were gonna do, man. I didn't know. I didn't know, please, man, don't kill me, man. Please don't, don't shoot me, man. Talk to me, don't shoot me. I didn't know what they were gonna do, man. I didn't know what they were gonna do. Please don't shoot me, man, I'm your brother, man. Please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me, no. No! (gun fires) (horn honks) (cars driving) (suspenseful music) (man vomits) (suspenseful music) (baby crying) (man vomits) (suspenseful music) (baby crying) - [Man] Shit, Mark. - You gotta fucking be kidding me. (crowd shouting) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (punches landing) (dramatic music) Come back to visit me, you little fuck. Oh, you missed me, huh? Where the fuck is Gina, huh? Ow. Come here, you little fuck. (dramatic music) (grunts) (suspenseful music) - Well, well, well. If it isn't my good friend, Joey Randall. (suspenseful music) Come here to kill me? (suspenseful music) Come on, come on, get down. - Why'd you do it, Captain, why? - What? - What? You disgusting son of a bitch. - Cut it out, Randall. It'll be good for you. You know, when she died, she cried your name over and over and over again. But you were too drunk to hear her. Oh, I heard about Gina. (dramatic music) Jesus Randall, women have a tendency of dying around you. (dramatic music) - I got the tape. - You could give it to me. - No, I can't do that. (dramatic music) - You know, you could easily have been on the force and stay there if you kept your mouth shut. - Your days are numbered, Captain. - You know when I was a cop in New York, I used to kick ass in the 23rd, 34th, and 61st Street precincts. But now that I'm in LA, you're the new trespasser. That means that I can pick you up. I can burn your house. I can shoot your wife and I can kill your dog and the only protection that you have is if I can't find you, and I've already found you. So you may wanna use that gun. (punches) - I'm not the merciful. (gun fires) Revus. (dramatic music) - Oh, big tough guy with a gun, huh? (dramatic music) You're not gonna get out of here alive. - I don't have anything left to live for. - Then you'll die here and now. - At least I'll die like a man rather than getting shot in the back. - Hey, for the record, I didn't shoot your lady. (dramatic music) Come on. (grunting) (dramatic music) You hit like a bitch. (grunting) (dramatic music) Come on. (grunting) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Go for it. - Don't you think I could have killed you the first minute I walked into this place? - What are you waiting for? - A proposition, Revus. - What proposition? - I know everything they have over you, everything. - What's it to you? - Don't you understand the minute you finish doing their dirty work, they're either gonna kill you or lock you up. - Like I said, what's it to you? - We were both set up. Both of us. Look, I'll let you get back at James, otherwise you pull that trigger, you pull it. (dramatic music) - I got no beef with you. My beef's with James. - Does that mean you trust me? - I didn't say I trusted you. I just don't have a choice. (dramatic music) Let's get this shit over with. (tires squeal) - Randall. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Give it up, James. - You're a real piece of work, Randall. (guns firing) (dramatic music) In a few minutes, this whole place is gonna be swarming with cops. (guns firing) - We'll wait. - Will we? We could still make a deal. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - I know about your deals. - Oh. This one will be different. (suspenseful music) Randall, are you listening? - Yeah, I'm listening but I don't hear a damn thing. - Well, look, I'm coming out. I'm unarmed and... I'm gonna walk to my car and leave. (suspenseful music) Do you think anybody cares about the low lives we eliminate? Nobody gives a damn about the sacrifices we make in the pursuit of the criminals. The greater good outweighs the meaningless individual. (blows landing) (dramatic music) Where's the tape, Randall? (dramatic music) Where's the tape? (dramatic music) Guess I'm gonna have to take it from your corpse. (blows landing) (dramatic music) (sirens blare) (dramatic music) (applause) - Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Before I address my friends and supporters, there's someone I'd like to introduce who I'm sure that you're all very familiar with. Someone who has kept a lid on crime in our city for years. Someone who will continue to fight the good fight for years to come. I hope. When I'm re-elected mayor, he will be standing right by my side. Would you please give a warm welcome to our police chief, Mr. George Moreno. (applause) Where the hell is James? - He's right here, now, remember. Thank you for that vote of confidence, Mayor. For years, I have fought against crime and corruption in this fair city, and the proof is in the pudding, crime is down by more than 50%. (applause) And yet, I had to rally against those who would have made this city a haven for criminals. I even lost my dearly beloved wife to a terrible crime. (dramatic music) We are winning the battle but we must win the war. (dramatic music) We must continue to fight against the criminal element in this city, and the only man who can lead us in doing that is our mayor, Mayor Richardson. (applause) Do you see who's here? - Yes, George, I see. Stay calm, it's all fine. - I'd like to be brief and conclude by simply saying we should support our wonderful mayor, Mayor Richardson, the only man who can bring us beyond the millennium. - No need to worry folks, everything's under control here. Just a little interruption by some random trash. You wanna get those people down by the rail, thank you, detective. Right, just restrain him near the van, please, thank you. - Look at the monitor. Look at the monitor. - This divorce is killing him. Suddenly his wife has become a thorn in my side. Suddenly his wife has become a thorn in my side. - [Man] So when do you want me to take care of her? - [James] Very soon. - [Man] Oh, Lieutenant, you want to hit the monitors here. - But very clean. Very clean. - What the hell is this? - Lieutenant are they cut? - You son of a bitch. - [James] It was necessary. - Whatever, you son of a bitch. Arrest him. (cameras clicking) (dramatic music) - I can walk by myself. (dramatic music) You know there is a mistake here. I was guaranteed anonymity. You know what that is, right? We could call the mayor's office or maybe the DA, but I don't belong here. (dramatic music) I don't really belong here, you know what I'm saying, right? (man speaking indistinctly) (dramatic music) (metal clangs) I don't belong here. (man speaking indistinctly) (metal clangs) (footsteps echo) (birds chirping) (somber music) - I was really fortunate enough to have had Gina in my life. (somber music) But I guess some things are never meant to last. It doesn't seem fair that she suffered for my sins. But deep down inside, I know. I know that someday we'll be together. Goodbye, my love. (somber music) Goodbye. (somber music) (dramatic music)
