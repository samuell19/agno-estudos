The ancient Greeks believed humans once had four arms, four legs, and a single head made of two faces. We were happy. Complete. So complete that the gods, fearing our wholeness would quell our need for worship, cleaved us in two... leaving our split selves to wander the Earth in misery. Forever longing. Longing. Longing... for the other half of our soul. It is said that when one half finds its other... there's an unspoken understanding. A unity. And each would know no greater joy... than this. Of course... the ancient Greeks never went to high school. Good hang out. Whatever. Or they'd realize... Crap. ...we don't need the gods to mess things up for us. If you ask me... people spend far too much time looking for someone to complete them. How many people find perfect love? Or if they do... make it last? More evidence of Camus' theory that life is irrational... and meaningless. And that, my friends, is some A-plus love philosophy right there. Or A-minus if Mrs. G is in a bad mood. Either way, it's an A or you don't pay. Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral persons. And everyone who loves and practices lying... Ellie Chu! Chugga chugga Chu Chu! Fantastic. The angels weep with joy. Next up... the winter talent show. Mandatory for all seniors. This is your last chance to strut your stuff. Mandatory. Once again, the wall tubas must be checked out before use. These are very delicate instruments with sticky valves. Some bad news. Someone left their Dr. Pepper in our storage cupboard. Imagine a world without flutes... - Did you mute me, Bruce? - No, Kaitlin, I didn't. I can tell if you mute me, Bruce. I can tell. Jerry's parents are in Spokane... I'll bring the Xbox. ...please bring it back. No questions asked. Is there a problem? No, Mr. Flores. Next up, we had an issue... I heard his sister went to Seattle with the church. She's majoring in sociology. Hey. Send this down to the big guy. - I think I'm going deaf. - Oh, thank you very much. No, but honestly, man, the man I want to be when I'm older is not the man I am today, you know what I'm saying? Aster! - So, you've just gotta keep living, man. - Always has her head in a book. - You've just gotta keep living life. - Choir, stand up.

Five hundred words on Sartre's use of thwarted desire, Monday. - Six different takes on Plato. Impressive. - Just the one. That's what I tell the bartender. How come you never turn me in? And have to read the actual essays they'd write? - You know I'm going to E-dub. - Damn shame. Damn full ride. I can live at home and, plus, I get to stay in lovely Squahamish. - Hell-quahamish. - It's not that bad. Okay, it's not that good either, but it's what's happening. I spent four of the best years of my life at Grinnell. And look at you, back home in Hell-quahamish. You're right. Stay away from the liberal arts. - Try not to get fired over the weekend. - Are you kidding? Everyone in this town fears God, but you know who God fears? The Teachers Union. Chugga chugga Chu Chu. Hey! Hey. Hey! Hey! Hold up! Whoa! What is wrong with you? I'm sorry. I, uh... Uh... Ten dollars for three pages, $20 for three to ten. Not in the over-ten-page biz. No, I'm not trying to cheat. Nobody is. Whose class is it for? No, it... it's not... Um... - What's this? - A letter. - Who writes letters these days? - I... I thought it'd seem romantic. - Can't help you. - I... I just need a few words. Good ones. I'm not writing to Aster Fl... To some girl. It'd be wrong. A letter is personal. It's supposed to be authentic. - That'd be awesome. - No! I can't be you being authen... Get a thesaurus, use spell-check. Good luck, Romeo. No, I can pay more for authentic. Did you call the power company? They don't understand my accent. Did you try? Shh. Best part. "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." I'll call tomorrow. Inland Power And Light. I'm calling for account 460A38. Please hold. Please re-enter your selection. Bill. Extension. Please hold. These hallways are murder. I'm Ellie Chu. Yes, I know. You've only been playing my dad's services every Sunday for, like, four years. You're his favorite heathen. He can't handle mediocre accompanists. Even if they are saved. Remains Of The Day. Loved it. All that barely repressed longing. "I'm Ellie Chu"? Yes, I know. Your bill is three months overdue, Mrs. Chu. If we don't get a minimum payment of $50, your power will terminate tomorrow. Fifty dollars, one letter. After that, you're on your own. Yes! "Dear Aster Flores: I think you're really beautiful. Even if you were ugly, I'd want to know you, because you are smart and nice, too." "It's hard to find all those things in one girl. But even if you were only two of those things, I'd be into it. But you're, like, all three, just to be clear." She's like all three. Thanks for clarifying. "About me. Some people think I'm the cutest one in my family. Those people being my grandma... who's dead now. Never mind about my dead grandma. All I'm saying is that I like fries. I like dipping them in my milkshake. Is that weird? It's actually really tasty. Would you like to try that with me sometime? I work part-time and I have a truck. Let me know whenever. Thanks. Paul Munsky, second string tight end... football." - So what you're trying to say is... - I'm in love with her. Have you ever spoken to her? I'm not good with words. But you know you love her? I know I think about her when I wake up. And when I'm doing my sprints. And when I'm eating my mom's bratwurst and when I'm saying my prayers... That just means you're stubborn. Not that you're in love. No, it's love. Love makes you screwy. Don't you get screwy? No. This whole section needs... Although, that fry thing does sound good. A dangling modifier. Oh, I get it. Get what? You've never been in love. You want a letter about love? I'll write you a letter about love. One that'll make her fall in love with me, not storm off in a huff like you're doing. This isn't even American. How are you going to learn English? Shh. Best part. "Longing... longing for a wave of love to swell up in me." You sealed it. No, I'm sure it's good. Hushmo me. Hey. Hey! Hey! She wrote back. "I like Wim Wenders, too. Wouldn't have plagiarized him, though." Who's Wim Wenders and why'd you cheat off him? - I didn't cheat off of him. - No, I looked up "plagiarize." - I kind of cheated off him. - I paid you! - But this is good. - How? It's... It's like a game. She's, like, challenging us. But in a good way. So, uh... we're... we're still in the game. Yep. Mm-hmm. We are. So... yay. Game on, Aster Flores. Game on. "Dear Aster: Okay, you got me." "I sometimes hide behind other people's words. For one thing, I know nothing about love. I'm 17. I've lived in Squahamish my whole life." Such a downer. - It's not a downer. - A major downer. Ask her to hang out. What exactly is... hanging out? You know, uh, hanging out. - But, like, what do you do? - Munsky, what's up? Uh... uh, confession. - Want to go to Joey's and hang out? - Yeah. "I hang out with my friends. I keep my head down." "I'm a simple..." - Paulie! - "...guy." This meat won't grind itself. "Which is to say... if I knew what love was, I would quote myself." Right here, man. People, air, weather. Why would we ever leave? Psst! In here! Isn't this sacrilegious? She wrote back. "Dear Paul..." "You know it takes 11 muscles to yawn? This is the sort of weird fact I find myself recalling to keep myself from..." "...well, yawning." We believe that God loves us. "Or showing anything I feel really." - We believe blindly and... - "So, yeah... I turn to other people's words, too." ...imagine how the right gravel can change your life. Sweetheart, sit up straight, please. Like a lady. "When you're a pretty girl, and I know it makes me sound conceited, but that's why you're even writing me, right?" "When you're a pretty girl, people want to give you things." It would look so cute on you. - "What they really want..." - Oh. "...is to make you like them." Thanks. "Not like them as in, 'I like you, ' but like them as in, 'I am like you.'" Like... so cute on you. Oh. Oh, you... you mean right now? Mm-hmm. ♪ Check me out, check me out ♪ ♪ I'm underground... ♪ "So I'm like a lot of people. Which makes me kind of no one." ♪ Every inch of my design Is far from grace... ♪ Uh... - Can I text her now? - Too soon. No, I'm gonna do it. If you want her to think you're like everyone else. "I never really thought about the oppression of fitting in before. The good thing about being different is that no one expects you to be like them." Hey, wait for me! "Doesn't everyone think they're different, but... pretty much we're all different in the same way?" "Says the girl perched on the rarefied peak of Mt. Popularity." Babe! Taco time. "Easy, Mr. I Know Nothing About Love. I may surprise you." So, where do you wanna go? I want to go somewhere where I could get pajamas. Do you wanna go to Gap? The one in Tukwila has a GapBody. I love GapBody. It has, like, 15 dressing rooms. Oh, it's the better Gap. So much better than the one in Wenatchee. Ugh. Wenatchee... Oh, my God. Go look at Molly's posts. - Eww. - She looks so gross. - She looks so gross. - Why would she post that? I have no idea. Trig checked in at Dick's Fry Fry. Aster is so lucky. Totes lucky. His family owns half of Squahamish. Hers doesn't even own their house. You're so rude. You know that it's true. Yeah, it's true. "What's surprising is people don't see what they're not looking for." "The obvious unseen." So... this is why half my class is failing their essays. I'll be reopen for business soon enough. And this can't go on much longer. "I've been thinking about what you said about seeing and not seeing." Yes, I do! "I had a painting teacher once tell me that the difference between a good painting and a great painting... is typically five strokes. And they're usually the five boldest strokes in the painting. The question, of course... is which five strokes?" "I get it. After one's slaved away at making a pretty good painting, the last thing you'd want to do is make a bold stroke and potentially..." "Ruin everything. That's why I gave up painting. Still, I wonder if that is how I'm living my life." Hey, babe? Which one? Right one, right? Great. Let's do this. "It's a... pretty good life. Probably the best life one could hope for in Squahamish." "Perhaps... but how well do you really know Squahamish?" "Oh, so that's your boldest stroke?" "I'm into the slow build. What was that?" "Decisiveness. But, please, take all the time you need to be bold." "Is this bold enough for you?" "And thus was abstract art born." "And transformed." Hey! Hey! "Or not." "Everything beautiful is ruined eventually. Maybe that's the thing. If you do ruin your painting... you gotta know you have everything in you to get to that pretty good painting again." "But if you never do the bold stroke..." "You'll never know if you could've had a great painting." ...triangle is different. All polygons with three sides. Take one side away, now it's just an angle. Add a side, that's a square. When does the dating start? This is dating. No, dating is burgers and fries and shakes. And maybe another order of fries. And... - I'm gonna text her. - Wait, what? - At a certain point, you've gotta close. - We're not at that point! We're way past that point. Oh, my God. I've gone... "Little sister hacked my phone. Can we take this to a safer platform? Ghost Messenger? My handle's... Smith Corona." - Who's Smith Corona? - Just a guy. Crap. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! I'm the king of the mud! Babe! Babe, did you get that? Caption it, "Mudding king." Mudding king! Mudding king! Mudding king! Mudding... New ghost message. - Yeah, we did it! - Yes! She prefers abstract to representational. If she brings up Remains Of The Day, talk about how the movie loses out by not spending more time on the Nazis. Relax. I got this. - But... - It's a date, not a book report. I got two of them signed when he came to Powell's Books last year. I drove all night to get there. Oh, uh... Cool. You've probably already read it. - Thought you'd like one. - Uh, yeah, totally. No, I... I love, uh... Nazis. I mean, the... the ones in the book. I mean, like, more of those Nazis. Am I right? Uh, speaking of Nazis... thank you for meeting me here. My dad... he isn't a Nazi exactly, but, uh... he can be pretty strict. You know, people talk. Um, yeah. Talk. Ugh. It's nice... to make a new friend, though. Oh. A friend. Good. They use Reddi-wip. Oh. It's, uh... from a can. Uh... but it's okay. It wasn't that bad. What about that date wasn't bad? You have nothing in common. Not yet, but... Game over. I can't give up. Look, you and Aster Flores, not gonna happen. - Chugga chugga Chu Chu! - Hey! - Who are you calling "Chu Chu"? - Shit, let's get out of here! What kind of wusses say dumb shit and then drive away? Yeah, you'd better run! What? Aster Flores thinks you're into abstract art and repressed British literature. - Yeah. - None of that is you. It could be. I started reading that Remains Of The Day book. - Really? - Yeah. I fell asleep a few times, but I'm still reading it. That's gotta count for something. There are no points for effort. Isn't that what love is? How much effort you put into loving someone? Well, whatever love is, we just blew it with Aster Flores. Yes! No, I can do this. We can do this. Okay. I'll pay you double. You don't have to pay me. Don't be weird, dude. Why else would you do this? No, I've got savings. Next date is three weeks away. - Three weeks? - You told her you're slammed - with football training. - I... I did? Yes. Also, you're in a debate on who's the better Hepburn. Who there? Ba, did we wake you? School project. Hi, Ellie Chu's dad. We don't have time to school you on everything Aster thinks you are, so we have to be selective. Deep versus broad-based learning. - Huh? - We spy on her, then cram you on her greatest hits. Oh, cool. - Are you ready for this? - Yes. Are you ready for this? Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Shh! So, in No Exit, three people are trapped in hell. A door opens, but nobody leaves. That's nuts. He can't stand these people. A door opens and he doesn't leave? He's trapped in hell. It's a metaphor for existence. My nana hated Minnesota. She left. Your nana wasn't one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. Nana's not trapped in hell either. Hey! Hey, where are you going? The hell's got into Munsky? You're like some marvelous, distant, well, queen, I guess. You're so cool and fine. I don't want to be worshiped, I want to be loved. Key thing about The Philadelphia Story is it's a plea for tolerance. Check this out. I'm calling it taco sausage. Do you want a bite? No. So tolerance... Two hand foods, one great taste. Conversation is like ping-pong. I hit one and then you... What the... Oops. We're writing a profile on the student we most admire. Oh, cool, cool. - Views on women in the workplace? - Does Aster like lean meats? What are you doing? - I'm good cop. - Then how come you aren't smiling? I'll smile when you follow the plan that I carefully... I'm surprised more kids haven't asked to interview me. Huh. I'm going in. I'm going in with my smile. Looks like The Moose have a man open. Oh! You're not hungry? Not if it's not time to eat. Now that's weird. Hey, uh, can I ask you a question? I don't want to try a taco sausage. Why Squahamish? Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here and you also seem kind of unhappy. - I gotta go. - No, no, no, wait. No, you're not taking this seriously. I have a ton of work I have to do. No, just, you're so smart. Like, too smart to, like... Waste my time trying to win you a girl who'll never look your way? - No, it just seems weird. - You're weird! No... Yes. - Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish. - No, no... The thing about No Exit is it's like how what I really want is to run my own shop, with new recipes. And... And FYI, taco sausage is really effing good. Okay, but I'm the fourth son and my family's been making the same sausage for 49 years and it doesn't matter if they're going broke, or out of style, they're Nana's recipes. If Ma can't have Nana, at least she can make her sausages. If I break away, it'll break her heart. And it's either her heart or mine. So I stay. We had to go where my dad could get a job. He studied trains? Engineering. PhD, no less. So, uh, he became the station manager at Squahamish. To start. The plan was to be promoted to system engineer. Or anything engineer. Squahamish was a jumping-off point. It turns out speaking good English trumps having a PhD. Or one from China anyway. And my dad, he... Doesn't speak very good. - He's not bad. - I don't speak very good either. True. What's your excuse? How do you feel about pot roast? I should get back to the station. I know, but we've gotta eat. Mom! Tommy, stop friending my friends! Would you like to weigh in or are you just gonna scream throughout the meal? I'll deal with the dog wrestling. - Mom! - It's your fault! Or we could go to your place? Match energy, match strokes, and just say one thing. Where were you born? In Squahamish. What about you? Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard. But where were you born? I don't need talking practice. It just seems like a really short conversation. I was born in Xuzhou, China. When did you come here? When I was five. - What do you like about Squahamish? - Uh... I've never been anywhere else. Me neither. How does Satan get his message through? Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral persons. Does he write letters? No, he causes us to question. Question our lives, our path. Our very faith in God. Satan plants the seed of doubt... ...and, from that seed, grows sin. Sin is everywhere. We're lucky to live in a good town like Squahamish. But the world is changing. Let us stay strong against Satan's call, lest sin creep in and destroy the good life God has prepared for us. You know what it's like to finally meet someone your age who gets you? You know where else you can meet people your age who get you? College. You should send some emojis. I'm not sending her emojis. Do pineapple, owl, caterpillar with glasses. What does that mean? That doesn't mean anything. Glasses make the caterpillar look smart. Favorite food? Braised pork over rice. Yours? Taco sausage. - Does braised pork have five-spice powder? - How do you know five-spice powder? I kind of creeped in your cabinets. I'm always looking for new spices. Giving up on the taco sausage? Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper in Wenatchee for months now. If I could just get the guy to taste it. - The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee. - Yeah. Hey, you gotta try it. What do the other Munskys think? They haven't tried it. Taco sausage has a nice ring to it. Yeah, right? Hey. Yeah? What was your mom like? Young, funny, dead. No, before she died. Young, funny... fun. She sounds cool. Yeah. I bet she would've tried the taco sausage. What do you like about Aster? She's pretty... and... smart... and she's never mean. And she smells like fresh-ground flour. Why? Just wondering. What else could I like about her? I don't know. How her eyes look right into yours. How... she twirls her hair when she's reading. How... her laugh... busts out like she can't help herself and she stops being so perfect for just a few moments. She has at least five different voices. How you could live in an ocean of her thoughts and... feel like she knows, like really knows... I'm so stupid. - I just meant... - No, I'm so dumb. - No... - Like a real idiot. - Don't think that I... - No, what you said. That's what you say when you love someone. No, I... I was just talking. - I would never, ever actually... - No, it is. And... And you don't even care. I mean, I love her and I can't even... Agh! You try... harder than... anyone I've ever met... I mean, with the possible exception of my dad with my mom... to show a girl that... you love them. And if love isn't the effort you put in... then... what is it? Yeah? Yeah. I can't believe you drink Yakult. Stadium vending machine. Coach is gonna provide it free. Keeps him regular. Seriously? The only Asian grocery is three hours by bike. Do not run after her train. Do not. Do not! Ugh. - It's kinda sweet. - Kinda trite. Uh, it shows that he cares. It shows he's a moron. Who outruns trains? That girl's thinking, "Thank God I got out before wasting my life on that idiot." She looks sad. Then she's a moron, too. ♪ Safe and sound ♪ ♪ As the night tore and spun around ♪ ♪ Da-da-dum ♪ ♪ Da-da-dum ♪ ♪ Da-da-dum ♪ Lost track of time practicing for the senior talent show.

Paul's cool. He's confusing. It's like when I'm with him... I feel... I feel safe. He's a sweet guy. Then it's like he... writes these things that feel... not safe. Not safe? I overheard Trig talking to my dad about... our future wedding. I mean, he hasn't even asked me yet, but... he's just... so sure. And maybe that's love. I should marry Trig. Oh. Should I? Oh, well. God doesn't know either, if it's any consolation. I don't believe in God. That must be so nice. No. It's not. It's... lonely. Yeah. I wish I knew what I believed. I keep asking God for a sign. And then Paul's letter appeared in my locker. I've... never felt so... ...understood. It's... It's silly, right? No. It's not silly. You know what is silly? What are you... No, stop! - Come on! - No. I... Did you layer? I am a Russian doll of clothing. Gravity is matter's response to loneliness.

I want to go someplace where I can be a woman. - You mean be a traitor. - A traitor to what? To journalism. You're a journalist, Hildy. A journalist? Hell, what does that mean? Paul made a braised pork sausage. Pretty tasty. Yours is in the microwave. Hey. Hey. Do you believe in God? Uh... of course. Yeah. Yeah, no, of course. I, uh... I got your painting. It was... It was pretty. Thanks. Um... Big game this week. Uh, training. I'll, uh... I'll see you after? Yeah. - Um, cool. - Okay. Paulie, are you marrying the garbage out there? Looks like another blowout with the Squahamish Moose down by 49. Fourth down on their own ten-yard line. Less than a minute left on the clock. Players are lining up for the punt. - Hut! - Whoa, bad snap. There's an awful lot of confusion out there. Looks like the punter is trying to free the ball up and salvage a few yards out of this horribly crooked play. Behind you! Oh! The punter takes a savage hit. Come on, Munsky! And Number 86 Paul Munsky's got the ball. Fifty! Forty! Thirty! Keep going! Keep going. He scores! Squahamish Moose have scored! First time in 15 years. We're on the board! We're on the board! We're on the board! We're on the board! We're on the board! Hey. - All hail the pride of Squahamish. - Thanks. Uh... You, uh, you didn't have to get me a Yakult. Oh. Yeah, take one. No, no, I don't, uh, want a Yakult. Good. Uh... Nah, I need to talk to you. Okay. Uh, my hands are full. Could you... Mmm. - So good. - Uh, hey... What? - What are you doing? - You don't want me to kiss you? - No! - Why? Is there someone else? Aster. Aster, this is not... We're... We're not... You... - Paul. - You, um... Uh... Um... You like Aster? It's a sin. You're going to hell. I'm onto you... Ellie Chu. This is a nightmare. I know why you're always hanging around. Popping up everywhere. Okay, it was just supposed to be one letter. - I didn't think... - You're in love with me. Yes, Trig. I am in love with you. I get it. Get away! Go home! Hey, hey, hey!

Paul. Sir? Did you and Ellie... mmm... break up? No, we weren't, um... together. She seems... sad. No, you don't, um... see her. See? See what? Who she is. Could be. Her. When Ellie's Ma died... I fell into a dark hole. I didn't move for days. A few days later... I woke to find Ellie in the booth... manning the switch. She looked up at me. Just 13... an adult already. And I... smiled. Have you ever loved someone so much... you don't want anything about her... to change? ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪ ♪ Merciful and mighty ♪ ♪ God in three persons ♪ ♪ Blessed Trinity ♪ Outside are the dogs, the... You're late. I had to grind something. And to close our Easter services... our final reading today will be from Trig Carson. "Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud." Which is why... I love... this little lady. And why she'll make me a fantastic... wife. Aster... will you? No! I, um... Uh, um... Love isn't... It isn't... Thank you, Ellie. - Everyone... - Love isn't pretending. Uh, I know, um... because I've been pretending. Only for a few months, but... it sucks. Paul. And I've been thinking about how much it would suck to have topretend to be... not you... uh... your whole life. I always thought that there was one way to love. Uh, one right way. But there are more. Uh, so many more than I knew. And... I never want to be the guy who stops loving someone... for loving the way that they want to love. And thank you, Paul. That was... odd. Now, let's give Trig... I also have been pretending. I've been pretending that... Don't worry, everyone, I, uh... I think I know where this is going. Um... Look, Ellie, I am so, so flattered, um... - but, see, you and I are never... - You know, Trig, I have been writing your papers for the last four years. And if you'll forgive me... I'm just gonna rewrite you one last time. Love isn't patient and kind and humble. Love is... Love is... Love is messy. And horrible and selfish and... bold. It's not finding your perfect half. It's... the trying... and... reaching and... failing. Love is... being willing to ruin your good painting... for the chance at a great one. Is this really the boldest stroke you can make? You. Yeah. Aster! Everyone, please, take your seats. Everyone, take your seats. Wait. So I'm the good painting? Mommy wants you to know, in case you are gay, Mommy still loves you. - I'm not gay, Mom. - Thank God. I might want to change our sausage recipe, though. Are you insane? - I love that recipe! - Whatever Dad said! Now that is some divine intervention. This is a lot of dumplings. Six days, 18 meals. To Grinnell. We didn't come here so you could be like me. We came here so you could be like your mother. You don't mean dead, right? God, I hope not. You haven't been to church. I'm busy. Yeah? Yeah. You need four portfolio pieces for art school, so... Art school? That's great. Yeah, well, nothing's great yet, but we'll see. What's going on with you? Well... I'm headed east to Grinnell. - I'm leaving tomorrow... - That's great, Ellie. Take care. Aster! I'm sorry. It was just... supposed to be one letter. I never meant to hurt you. Deep down, I probably knew the truth. You really didn't use enough emojis in his texts. I don't know what they mean. A puppy or... - a sausage... - I should have sent you a sausage emoji? Fair point. For what it's worth... it's not like the thought never crossed my mind. You know... if things were different. Or I was different. You could never be different. "Am I sure I'm different? - How do I know I'm sure?" - Hey, I can be sure. "I mean, what does God think?" Oh, my God. - And on, and on, and on, and on. - And you know, you... you watch. Okay? In a couple of years, I am gonna be so sure. Good luck with that. Find something good in Iowa to believe in, heathen. I'll see you in a couple years. I'll keep him busy tasting new ketchups. Nice write-up in the Town Crier. Yeah, Munsky Sausages is gonna blow up. I might get to Iowa before you do. I'd better get going then. Here. The caterpillar does look smart. Too smart to be crying on a platform like a wussy. I'm not crying. Wussy. Wussy! Next stop, Cle Elum. Hey! Hey! - Hey! - What? Paul, what are you doing? Stop! Stop! What are you...
