Luther. Luther. Luther! Where is that boy? -Are you all ready? -Yes. -Now, don't be nervous? -I'm not, Dad. You know if you lie, your nose is gonna grow. No, it won't. Whenever you do get nervous, remember what I told you. Close my eyes and pretend you're there. That's right. What is this? I wanted to show my friends. We're all very proud, Reverend. Very proud. Come on, Luther. Come on. You better get going. Come on. Good luck, everybody. God bless you. -What have you got? -Nothing. Come on, tell me what do you got. -Why you killed it? -'Cause I was afraid. Mom! Shut up, butt stink. Now, do you think that God created heaven and earth... ...and populated this world without a specific thought in mind? If you do... ...you're wrong. We were meant to live apart. What? He changed the channel. Outside. I forbid you to watch that man in front of your brothers, Owen. What are you gonna do today? Sit around in your underwear again and drink beer? There's an opening at the diner. I ain't flipping no burgers! Owen, I need your help. You're part of this family too! You call this a family? Good morning. How are you this morning, Margo? I'm sorry, Isabel. I tried calling but you'd already left. What happened, Margo? What happened, honey, spit it out. Well, at least if they're gonna call us names they oughta learn how to spell. Come on, let's get this show on the road. This sacred oath must never be compromised. By joining us, you rebuke to side its government and its favoritism to all the nigger. You condemn the yellow hordes and the crowds of murdered people... ...that assault our very shores. And you denounce the tainted money of the vile Jew bankers. Never betray your white brothers. Never rest until we have won our Aryan Nation, under one God for one unpolluted race. So long as contaminated rubble exist among us, hatred is our law and vengeance our mission. Owen Tucker, what say you? Patriots, let me join your ranks. You have a home now. Arise and be welcome. White Power. White Power. Okay, calm down. Davey, Mikey, you behave. Okay, for today's assembly, we have a very special treat for you. Here to perform under the direction of Miss Isabel Jackson, please welcome the championship all-state vocal group, Liberty's own Baptist Choir. White brothers, today we have something special. Reverend Phelps. How nice to see you. He used to be a nigger who didn't wanna cross burden men. Killing me won't silence the truth. There, Reverend, nobody said anything about killing. I just wanna read you the paper. You'll be amazed what you'll find in there. Like today. "Reverend Luther Phelps, Sr." "a baptist preacher in Liberty," "used his pulpit Sunday to strike out against racial intolerance." A bunch of jaeger bull bullshit. No, no. Here it goes. It say, I quote. "The Arian homeland has attracted radical racists..." "...who are here solely to spread their message of hate." It says Phelps call these groups a scourge upon the land. A scourge? Ouch, Reverend, wow. Them some pretty harsh words, don't you think? Tell me, Reverend. You ever played baseball? Of course, you did. Now then. Abner Doubleday, a white man, invented the game of baseball, he was looking for a way to teach people skills like... ...coordination and how to keep your eye on the balls. Now, I invited you here today, Reverend, to encourage a little sportsmanship. You need to develop a certain respect for the other team. Am I making myself clear here, Reverend? Am I making myself clear, nigger? Respect is good for all... ...or it ain't good for none. God don't judge us... ...by the color of our skin. I'll take that as a yes. Well, Reverend, I'm just tickled pink we were able to have this little chat here today and... ...you could bestow all your wonderful nigger wisdom on us poor white trash. Now, you go on now. You go on home and you take care of yourself, all right? Go on. I'm not kidding. Go ahead. Oh, damn, one more thing, Reverend, I forgot. Let this be a message to all who oppose us. We will no longer remain the silent majority. This is white man's land! Black people will not be tolerated. What say you? White Power. White Power. White Power. White Power. Excuse me, do you have a payphone? Yeah, back on the men's room. Thank you. Batter up. You got a problem, sweetheart? You're hurting me. Get your hand off her. Hey, he didn't mean nothing by it. He didn't hurt you, did he, darling? Miss, can I get a cup of coffee, please? You see how slow he looked at me? Maybe he wants to be friends. Maybe I'll show him what kind of friendly people we can be, huh? -Well, here you are. -No charge. Are you sure? Thank you. Hey, how you doin'? -Hey, how you doin'? -Hey, now, you're not from around here, are you? You're just passing through? -Excuse me. -Name's Donnie Hansen. How you doin'? Tommy Lee. Lee? Well, I'll be that's a good southern name like Confederate General Robert E Lee. Any relation to you? It was nice meeting you. Excuse me. Hey, where you going? Maybe we can give you a ride. No, that's okay. Are you sure? Yeah. All right then. You come back now. Oh, God. Is there a problem, officer? Oh, yeah. There's a problem, all right. You're late. You're on foot. Got your message. Good to see you, Jack. Yeah, it was good to be seen. -How you been? -Good. Im'ma grab that. Now I sent a tow truck for your car. You'll have it back in no time. Great. Great. Your sister's been looking forward this all week she's cookin' up a storm. She cooks? -She's getting better. -She couldn't get any worse. Hey, Jack, what happened? Liberty is not what it used to be, Tommy. Come on, Luther. You should have had that one easy. Justin, I said that's enough. He doesn't wanna do anything, mom. Well, sweetie, maybe he doesn't feel like it right now, okay? Hey! Your dad's here. Come on, Luther. Look who I picked up. Tommy? -Tommy! -Hey, sis! I can not believe you're here. Look at you. -Hey, Uncle Tommy. -Hey, Justin. Man, look at you. Come on, put 'em up. Put it out. Put it out. Put it up. Get 'em, boy. He's gotten so fast. -Tommy, you remember Luther? -Of course. Hey, Luther. How you doin'? You know the last time I saw you? I dunno. You're about that big. How you doin', Luther? Okay, I guess. -Anybody hungry? -Yeah. Good. Liver and onions. Our cities have become war zones. The streets of our neighborhoods are littered with welfare babies. Our jobs have been stolen from us and given to the immigrants. And the Zionist government does not care. Oh, unless, you just got off the boat that is. Well. We here at the Church of the Aria and Crusade care. And because we care we are here to help. The expansion of the Arian homeland is our future. Working for ourselves, we will create our own nation under God, with liberty and justice for our children and our children's children! I'm counting on your commitment. I know that I can rely on your dedication, because we are all working for the same, ultimate goal! -Where have you been? -Around. -What are you doing? -I'm leaving. You get back and talk to me, Owen Tucker. Owen! Look at me! Oh, sweet Jesus. -If your Pa were here... -Yeah? Well, he ain't, is he? You made sure of that. Owen, please. You know what those people are doing to this town. -We're fighting for our race! -No. You're... You're disgracing it! I got attacked by one of them people today. What? Yeah, well, you probably deserved it. I didn't bring you into this world to go around hating people. Why did you bring me into this world? Owen. Owen Tucker. Hatred's given me something to live for. Hatred's gonna get you killed. Hatred's gonna get you killed! So why don't you arrest him? No witnesses. No body. Ain't much of a case. But you have an idea who did it? Yeah. So what about Luther? He's staying with us. You know what I'm going through. I got to look at that boy's face everyday, and give him hope... ...when I know there isn't any. Hi. Hey, I'm gonna take the kids for some ice cream. You wanna come? No, you guys go on ahead. Come on, Uncle Tommy. All right. I need to pick up a few things anyways. -Come on, Luther. -And I'd bet you want some chocolate chip. Oh, you twist my arm. -See you later. -See you. Come on, guys. -Where is the store? -It's over there. Okay, see you in a bit. Okay, boys, only one scoop, okay? Hi, Mr Martin. -How are you? -Hi, how are you? Got it? Okay. All right. Hey, you got it? Get down! Get down. Okay, what do you boys want? All right, all right, I'm coming. Stop it! Yeah, go back to where you belong! -Tommy! -Karen! Damn chinks multiple like rabbits. Come on! Hey, look at what we got here. Look, I don't want any trouble. You are a long way from home, boy. You don't need to do this. We'll be going. You gonna be goin', all right. Pretty boy. Real pretty. I told you I didn't want any trouble. Son of a bitch, you broke my nose! Come on. Let's get out of here. -Tommy! -Karen. Are you okay? I'm okay. It's over. Come on. The kids are okay. Karen! -Dad! -Justin, you all right? -It's fine. -They caught us. I wanna get the kids home. Now. -You boys see anything? -No. Come on, nothing? Mr Morgan? Sheriff? I know you saw the vehicle. I've got a wife and two kids, Sheriff. Then you should know better than anyone how I feel. What a night, huh? How you doin', pal? I'm okay. It's okay to be scared sometimes, you know. They called us "dukes". What does that mean? That means you're ignorant. I'm sorry I wasn't there. You can't be everywhere, dad. You're right. You know how much I love you? You do, don't you? I promise you, this will never happen again. -Okay, dad. -Okay? I won't let it happen. That's a promise. This child is a beauty. That pony is a beauty. He's a she. -He's a what? -She. A she. Sorry, girl. All right, Justin. Time to get ready. Go wash up, okay? -See you later, Uncle Tommy. -See you later, young man. Bye. He's missed you. We all have. I missed you guys too. He wants you to teach him how to defend himself. Karen, you know I don't teach anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Listen, help me do the litter and then let's go. Go where? -To the Four H fair. -The Four H fair? Yeah. You're volunteering. I am? Come on, come on. Missing it... Strike one! Hey, kid! What's the matter? You didn't eat your weenies? Put some muscle into it! Don't be a wimp! Come on! That's strike two. Hey, kid! Is that the best you can do? I mean, you throw like a little girl. Wait a second, David. Lemme buy the ball from you for five bucks. -Hey, lady! -Five bucks. Cool. Hey, lady? What are you doing? It's the kid's throw. No cheating here. I'm just gonna show you how a girl throws. Looks like clownie's all washed up, huh? Let's get outta here. Did she come in and talk to you, you know, talk to us and tell you a little bit... What is the matter with you. Get out of here. Buzz off, lady! It's public property! Owen? Owen Tucker? We don't teach hate here. It ain't hate. It's the truth! And you ain't my teacher. Give me those. -Get your hands off me! -Come on, let's get out of here. Why don't you go on home, girlie? Hey! Who the hell are you, boy? Call me the Killer Clown. Come on, Bo. Get him. Hold him. -Come on! -Don't do it, kid. -Come on! -Don't do it! Oh, shit! Come on! Come on, chink! You yellow bastard! I don't fear you! Oh, shit. Come on. I'll see you later. That wasn't necessary. I can take care of myself. What? You almost killed him. Hey, lady... ...you're welcome! Damn, this is twice what we talked about. Hey, this is military ordinance. It's very expensive. But for you, I'll throw this in. Damn. It feels good. Go ahead. Take her for a test drive. Go. I hate blind dates. I told you it's not a blind date. It's Justin's teacher. Oh, I know my sister. She's here. What do you think? Oh, God. The Ice Queen? I think you missed a spot. Where? I can't help it for being thorough. You know, I... I wanted to apologize for being such a bitch yesterday. What a strong word. Appropriate, but strong. I was trying to thank you for your help. No, you were right. You were absolutely right. About what? I should have let him punch you. Feisty, aren't you? -So tell me something, Margo. -What? -Are you always this tough? -Yes. Is that why you're not involved? I am involved. With him. You are going to get it. Ooh, you are gonna get it. -Promises, promises. -Stop it! -What? You're gonna hit me with a spoon? -Yeah. Don't you. You shouldn't hit girls. Your mother never told you you shouldn't hit girls? Jack! Tommy! Get out here, quick! What the hell is this? -Get them in the house, honey. -Go back in the house. I'll give you five seconds to get off my property. Four. Three. Two. White Power. Come on! Luther is gone! What? -I'll go get him. -I think I know where he went. -Come on. -Come on. Come on, Jack. Get back in the house. Luther? Are you okay? They are the ones who killed my dad. -How do you know? -I saw this before. They burned a cross. They took him. I never did anything to them. Why do they hate me? Luther, I'm gonna tell you something and I want you to listen to me. It's not that they hate you. They hate anyone who's different from them. My dad taught me to love everybody. I can't help it. I hate them. You can't fight hate with hate. It will only eat you up inside. How would you feel if they killed your dad? I don't know, Luther. I want him back. He never left you. I'll bet he's watching over you right now. And if you'll just remember what he taught you, he'll always be with you, okay? Okay? Come here. Give me a hug. Gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. And that brings us to the last item of business on today's agenda. A proposal from the Church of the Arian Crusade... ...to purchase from the City of Liberty, parcel 154, that's the 2500 acres at the northeast corner of the city limits. Now, unless there is any discussion or objection, I intend... Gentlemen, there are some empty seats if you would like to... Very well. Now, as I was saying, if there are no objections, I will recommend approval by the council. Very good. Then, if there is nothing else, -this meeting... -Excuse me, Mr Mayor. I have something I'd like to say. We all know each other here. We're neighbors. And we all know Mr Bryan. He's our neighbor as well. Most of us do not like what Mr Bryan has to say, but we've always respected his right to say it. That's right. But now Mr Bryan wants to buy up our land so he could build a monument to hate. But I say Liberty is not for sale. Tell him, Margo. Yes, you tell him! Miss, it is not against the law for me to buy a property. This is still a free country. Yes, it is a free country, Mr Bryan. You know the words but you miss their meaning. You can see it in the children's faces as they look to the future, in the hopes that they'll always be able to live free... ...and decent as God intended, no matter what their race, creed, or color. I just wanna say something here. A threat to Liberty here is a threat to liberty everywhere. Do you hear what I'm saying? A threat to Liberty here is a threat to liberty everywhere! I preach only simple separation. -Now we have a right to live our lives... -Everyone does, Mr Brian. But there are those among your followers who take your words as a license to hate, and kill. We will no longer be intimidated by you, Mr Brian. Or by your followers. Liberty has no place for prejudice, hate, or violence. Yes. Order. Mr Brian. It has become apparent that the interests of your church... ...are inconsistent with those of our city. Yes! Yes! Came into the barbecue last night? Walk away. You hate me just as much as I hate you. You'll remember your blood is red like mine. Hansen do yourself a favor and get the hell out of here now. Break it up, folks. It's over. Come on. Tommy, what the hell were you doing up there? Oh, Jesus, Jack. Are you gonna sit around and let them do to us what they did to Reverend Phelps? Hey! Hey, Tommy. Look, I will handle it but I got to do it by the book. Jack, I don't think the other team is playing by your rules. Hey, Margo, why do you call him Rose? His real name is Rosebeth. But you can call him Rose. Sometimes have to pay the price for what you believe. Is that why you stopped teaching? Karen told you? So, what else did she tell you? That you killed a man. He murdered my friend. Then he came after me. I... I had no choice. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought that up. Margo. What I did was against everything that I believed in. Everything. Tommy, you've got to stop blaming yourself. You said you had no choice and I believe you. Now you do have a choice. You can stay here and help your family or you can walk away. I won't let Hansen hurt my family. Give out all those binding. Stack the rest in the armory. Hey! Sorry, sorry. Where in the hell is Hansen? He's in the meeting hall, sir. How could you betray me? These are weapons of aggression, weapons of war. Yes, sir. A race war which is imminent. This is exactly why people fear us. They think I want to exterminate not separate! But pastor... ...we do. I trusted you. I gave you a life. This is how you repay me? He who preaches war is the devil's chaplain. I want you, I want him, out of here by tomorrow! -The men need new leadership. -I agree. Get out of my way. Yes, the men do need new leadership. But he was one of us. I will decide who is us. What are you doing here anyway? I thought I told you to follow that monk. I did. I left them last night at the teacher's... Miss Preston's... Two birds with one stone. Donnie, you know what to do. Who are you? Hey, you. Stop. Get the monk! Come on. After him! Rosie. Rosie, be quiet. Rosie, what is the matter? Get away from me. Swing it! Yeah! You like it rough, don't you? Knock it off or I'll cut your throat. -Stop it! -Knock it off! He's not here. Find him. No, me first. Come here. Give me the knife. Look at that. Come on, look at that. -Stop! -Think about that. It's me! It's me! Margo. Margo. Shit! Thanks for the ride. Karen? Jack. Sons of a bitch. They took the boys. Still playing by the rules, Sheriff? My Arian brothers, warriors of God, I have tragic news. A man has brutally murdered our leader. This scum seeks to destroy our movement. And on this very night, he will lead a force against us. I have been called upon by God, to face my greatest challenge to serve as Pastor Brian's successor. And I call upon you, men, to fulfill your faith as warriors of our race. Do not underestimate the cleverness of this monster. His yellow eyes can see in the dark. His heart is more diabolical than yours are brave. He knows no honor. And so I say unto you, kinsmen, arise, and proclaim our destiny. Stand up and reclaim the soil our forefathers died for! We are God's warriors! We will fall to rise high above the mode of black, brown, and yellow! The color of our skin is our uniform! One heart, one beat. One hundred hearts, one beat! One thousand hearts, one beat! Hail victory! Where are the boys? Time to start talking, boy. Now I got you. He's here. Turn off the gas pipe! Boys? Justin? Dad? Luther. -Dad! -In here? Luther! Dad! You okay? Jack. Tommy, get down. Go, go, go! There he is! Get back! It's gonna blow! Over here. Ready, boys? Luther, Justin, come on. Get in the back and under the seats. Stay down. Jack. Jack! Jack! Go! Go! Margo! Back it up now! Now, now, now! Back it up! -Dad! -Get down! Get down! We're gonna make it! Keep holding, I'll hold them up! Tommy! Back it down! Dad! Guys! Come on! Dad! Dad! Dad! Go, go! Put this thing out! What do you expect? Go or I'll stick a drill in your ass! Come on. Come on! Oh, God, please. Oh, please, God. Oh, God! Thank you. Margo, come on! This way. Come on! Open the gate! Idiot. Get out of my way. Look over there. Drop it. Drop it. You. When are you gonna learn, kid? Come on, Lee. Can we all just get along? Now we'll see what color your blood is. Come on! Stay off! Keep back! Go on. Do it. I hate this world. Come on, bud. Hate is not the answer. Oh, no, man. You made a big mistake. Shoot that son of a bitch. What are you doing? I said shoot it. Shoot the son of a bitch! Armageddon is coming. The Apocalypse is here! Give me that! "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the cat," "and the young lion and the fatling together." "The cow and the bear shall feed." "The young ones shall lie down together," "and I will give peace unto the land," "and ye shall lie down..." "...and none shall make you afraid." Amen. Amen!
