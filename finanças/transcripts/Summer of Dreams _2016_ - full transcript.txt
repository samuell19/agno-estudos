We meet with the label, we get your advance, set up some tour dates, and you're back! And not a moment too soon. Just got my hotel bill for the month. Okay. We'll push for a bigger advance. I'll see ya soon. Room service! Oh! Ahem. Liam's in town? Don't lecture me, Ray. I know you don't like him. I just don't like him for you. Good thing you manage my career and not my social life. Hey! I'm not just your manager. I'm your "work husband". You know, one day, I might have a real husband. Oh! I'd like to see that. Just not with him, all right? Debbie! - Dylan. - Hey! Nice to meet you. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I've been meaning to meet with you sooner, but things got a little crazy after I took over for Lew. This is Ray Royce. Royce Management. We spoke on the phone. Nice to meet you. Why don't you guys come on up? Come on in. Have a seat. Somebody offer you something to drink? Pellegrino? Sparkling water? Yeah. We're... We're good. Thank you. Your last record was, what? Three... Three years ago? Two. And I know sales dropped off a little bit, but this one will more than make up for it. As you know, the industry's changed. Things are all about a social media presence now. Oh! And here I thought it was about the music. Listen. There's really no easy way to say this, but, after careful consideration, we have decided to go another direction. With the music? With you. Sorry? How do I say this? We're no longer in the "Debbie Taylor" business. Are you dropping me? I am. I'm sorry. "Sorry"? I've been at this label since I was 15 years old. Debbie Taylor started this label. It wouldn't be here without her. You wouldn't be here! Well, I am now. Look, maybe if you're willing to reconsider the sound... but, until then, Taylor Swift is relevant, you're not. Taylor Swift. You used to be Taylor Swift. We'll find another label. In the meantime, we'll start exploring the other offers. What other offers? Okay. I know you said no more reality shows, but this one has no wild animals. Ray. Okay, okay, okay. How do you feel about singing at a private birthday party? Four figures. High four figures? Low... But a first-class round trip. To where? Saudi Arabia. Is that a "no" or a "maybe"? If you're my work husband, I want a divorce. So, happy anniversary, right? Two years. Who would have thunk? Yeah. Not me. I got you something. Me too. Ta-dah. Thank you. You first, you first. Okay. "With all my love... always, Debbie." Aw. Wow. Wow. Uh... That's, uh... It's amazing. I had it custom-designed. It's... It's... It's beautiful. You like it? Yeah. Okay. Me next. Um... Uh... It's a selfie-stick. I see that. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of our thing, right? We just... We keep it casual. When we're together, it's fun. When we're not... no pressure. I mean, that's what I love about you, Deb. That's what you love about me? Look, I... I'm going back on location. You're working on your album. Let's not pretend like this was ever anything serious. Let's not make a big deal out of this. But-But... But is a big deal. At least, I thought it was a big deal. Hey, you know what? I bet you can write a song about it. "I mean nothing to you." Oh, it'll top the charts. Debbie. Debbie, come on. Keep your stick. Deb! D, come on! "Debbie Taylor... "platinum albums, world tours, and international fame "at 15 years old. What ever happened to Debbie Taylor?" It's open. Thank you. There she is! I've been living like the party was never going to end, and guess what? It did. Hey, we've been in the trenches a long time. We'll get through this. Oh, I'm gonna miss those pillow mints. You know, maybe it's time to sell this. No! It'll keep you in the hotel a while. Ray, I would rather live in my car. Look. Maybe you could stay with me for a while. And "for a while," you mean somewhere between one night and the rest of my life? If necessary. Thanks, Ray, but... I need a break. I, uh, I need to get out of this place. I need some time. How much time? I don't know, enough time to get my head together. I need to figure out who I am, apart from who I was. Honey, the worst thing you can do right now is disappear. I'm already gone, Ray. Already gone. Debbie. Hey! W-W-What are you doing here? Uh, is something wrong? Does something have to be wrong for me to visit my sister? Yes. I just had some free time, so I thought... vacay? "Vacay". In Ohio. With you and the fam. Mwah! Oh, I would've called first, but I wanted to surprise you. And you did. Uh... Wow! The place looks great! Thank you. So, uh, where is everyone? Tim... Is... Oh! Picking up Natalie from soccer. And, um, you're not working anymore? No, I'm working. School's generally closed on Sunday. Yeah, right. Of course. So... Whoo. Uh, how long are you planning on staying? Oh, just a few days, give or take? Uh, the thing is, um, our spare room is now an office, so maybe you might be more comfortable in a hotel? Oh! There they are! Aunt Debbie? Natalie! Look at you! All grown-up. I'm 11 and a half. I can see the half. Hey, Deb. I thought that might be your car out there. Hey, Tim. Look at you! All grown-up, too. So, are you touring out here or something? No! She's vacay-ing. No kidding? That's great! You can stay in my room. I have bunk beds! Rock-paper-scissors for the bottom bunk? Oh! Top bunk. Cool! Oh, sweetie, don't touch that. It's very valuable. Oh, no, it's okay, it's meant to be played. Can you teach me how to do my hair like yours? No... she can't. Your mom's right. I can't. I have a glam squad. What's that? People I pay to make me look fabulous. So, Tim, are you still at the dealership? "Kick the tires, drive it off." Ooh! Catchy. Did Denise tell you she got promoted to assistant principal? Oh! - No. - It's not a big deal. Yes, it is. To the new Assistant Principal of... Youngstown High. - Youngstown High! - Youngstown High. You know what? I brought prezzies! Okay. For my niece... A Debbie Taylor make-up kit and perfume! She doesn't wear make-up yet. No? She's only in the 6th grade. Oh. My bad. Just hang onto it until you're in the 7th grade. Oh! And... for my sister. Oh, but... really, you shouldn't have. Open it. A new pair of shoes can change your life! Just ask Cinderella. They're beautiful. I wear mine all the time. But don't worry, don't feel guilty. They were swag. Well, honey, I guess we'll just have to go out now, won't we? Thank you. Ah. Oh! And... for my brother-in-law. Try it on. I, uh, custom-designed that, so, if there are a few extra links, just have your jeweler fix it. My "jeweler." Uh, sure. Debbie, really, this is all too much. Nah. No, she's right. We can't accept this. You can, and you will. Why is she even here? Maybe she wants to be with her family. No. That isn't it. You don't know that. Well, I know her. Well, whatever it is, she's here now, so maybe it's an opportunity for you two to get closer. I suppose... I can survive anything... for a few days. Right. Do we have a jeweler? A kid in my class has 5,500 Instagram followers and all he did was eat a worm. I'm not eating a worm. You just have to chronicle your life. I think I'll start by living my life. What have you been doing all this time? That's a good question. You're like "Alice". Alice In Chains? "Alice in Wonderland." She fell down the rabbit hole and everything was new. So the rabbit hole leads to Ohio? Maybe! You're an interesting kid. What's your bedtime? Uh... late. You? Late, too. You know, your mom and I used to stay up so late every night, talking. In the summertime, when it got dark, we would go out to the hood of Grandma and Grandpa's car, and we would look up at the stars, and talk and talk and talk. So you were BFFs? The Del Vecchio girls from Brooklyn! I am sure you've heard all the old stories. Not really. She never talks about you. She doesn't? Well, just about your shadow. My shadow? You know, the shadow she grew up in. That's why she moved here and made a normal life, so she could be herself, and not just your sister. Yeah. Uh-oh. Pretend you're asleep. You have a very powerful aura. It's a school night. Sorry. Goodnight! Goodnight. Come on in! Oh, hey! Why aren't you working? I've... come back. It's 3:30. P.M. You've been here a week. Wait. A week? Is that all? Um... I've got a PTA meeting, and I'm hoping you can help me out. Oh! I would love to sing for the PTA. What about "Lightning in a Bottle"? Actually, I thought you could go to the market and pick up some food for dinner. Butter, milk, pineap... pineapple! Wait... I'm making M... Mom's pineapple upside-down cake? Yes. Yum! Oh... Okay. Ho! Oh, uh, hey. Do you, uh, need some help there? Yeah. Um... Do you know where they keep the pineapple? Uh... canned or fresh? Um... um, I'm not sure. I would go with fresh. And... it's... Uh, here. Just... a little... easier with one cart. - Thank you. - Sure. Uh... follow me. We have fruits, vegetables... and... voilà, pineapple. Perfect! Mm-hmm. Whoa! I'm sorry. Uh, so... Now, these are oranges. Yes, I know. I've seen a picture of them, once. Ah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are you taking a picture of me? W-What? I don't mind posing for a selfie, but I really don't want some weird candid shot showing up on TMZ okay? Oh. Uh... Oatmeal. It's, uh, for my mom. I wasn't sure if this was the right brand, so... This is really embarrassing. Yeah. For both of us. Hello? Ray! I've changed my mind. I'm ready to go to Saudi Arabia. Deb, it's off the table. They got someone else. Who? Tiffany. Oh! Listen. Can I call you back? Who is that? Is that a new client or something? Hey, I'm working here. Call me in a couple of days, okay? You look good. I can't do normal things. I can't do anything. I-I can't even write my music anymore. This isn't just a "vacay", is it? My label dropped me. Oh... Debbie. So you're living here now? No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't call it living, exactly. I'm tapped out. How did that happen? I was expecting an advance for the next album. There's... There's always been a "next album", you know? Apparently, I've been spending money I didn't know that I didn't have. It's okay. I'll get my things, I'll be gone. No, you won't. You may be a royal pain... but you're still my sister. Thank you. Thank you. I'll... I'll do my own laundry, I'll get up earlier. Yes, you will. Because you'll be working. What? The after-school music teacher had to leave unexpectedly. You can fill in for the end of term. I don't know anything about kids. They're teenagers. Nobody does. How long is the term? Until the end of school. But that's, like, a month! Three months. Come on. Come on! Think of this as your make-under. Oh. So you're my anti-glam squad? Just promise me you'll stop before you turn me into Betty Crocker. 'Kay, Betty Crocker is not even a real person. Besides, you need to fit in. Don't people know that I'm your sister? I don't really talk about it. It's just... easier. I get it. And you might want to think about going by your real name. Debbie Del Vecchio from...? From... Brooklyn! Really? Looks like I'm in your shadow now. Class is from 3:00 until 4:00. If you find yourself running over, they'll need permission slips. Ah. I don't anticipate that being a problem. Well, uh... There you go! Wait! Aren't... Aren't you gonna introduce me? Most of the teachers just introduce themselves. Oh, come on! You cannot be nervous. You played Madison Square Garden! Yeah. This is far more intimidating. All right! Everyone! In your seats, please! Ladies and gentlemen, this is your new music teacher, Miss Del Vecchio. Hello, Youngstown! Good to be back. Yeah. Okay, I can see I need to warm up the crowd. That's okay. Uh... First of all, call me "Miss Debbie". Miss Del Vecchio was my mom. And it is because of her I am where I am today, so thank you, Mom. Yes? I'm Ashley, and I'm here for extra credit. I'm on the honors track and I'm going to... An Ivy League. Hey... Oliver! Where did you study? I studied in a series of bars, clubs, bowling alleys, and an occasional mattress store. What? Yes? The young man in the cheap seats? Johnny. Are you staying the whole term? Because our last few teachers left us to get real jobs. Oh, no, no, no. I can assure you, I won't be leaving to go get a "real job," because this is the only job I've ever had. You've never had a job? That's awesome! So you're not a real teacher? Well, I... You're supposed to be getting us ready for the prom. The prom? We're performing, and we need to pick a song. And it has to be perfect, or else everyone will laugh at us. Okay. Oh! Okay. I'm thinking power anthem. The Stones, Journey, Foreigner... Zeppelin! You guys with me? You feeling it? You ever heard of them? What are they teaching you in this place? Wait. I... I will demonstrate. Ahem! Okay. Two, three, four... ♪ Oh... ♪ Whoo! Yeah! Goodness. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Oh, well, I am the guidance counselor. Of course you are. This just keeps getting better. What's this? It's what I give all my emotionally- challenged students. "Stress, Hormones, and High-School." Not helping. All right, look. I think we got off on the wrong foot. I'm pretty sure we're still on that foot. Noah. Burns. Debbie Tay... Del Vecchio. Identity crisis? Because I have a pamphlet for that, too. How'd your mother like the oatmeal? Oh! Yeah, she didn't. Uh, it was the wrong brand. Ooh, back to the cereal aisle for you. Yeah. You know, first day at school is always the worst. Yeah, well, what about the second day? Uh, second day, usually that is pretty bad, too. Great. Look... this... this class. It's, uh, it's really important to them. Your... Johnny, he's in the foster system. You know, he's been bounced around a lot. Music is the one consistent thing he has. I mean, truth is, they're all there because they love music. They just need a way to express it. Them and me both. You know, if you do want to talk, my office is down the hall. Thank you, but the only guidance I need right now is how to get to the parking lot. Got it! Got it, got it. Down the hall, turn right at the lockers, left at the water fountain. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Hey! What are you two up to? Aunt Debbie bombed. Well... you've been booed off stage before. No, I haven't. I guess we can just add "teacher" to the list of things I'm not good at. No. That is not true. You taught me how to play the tambourine. You still have that? 'Course I do! Keeping it around in case... Motown makes a comeback. That was really good. I think you mean "terrible". Now, listen. You want to connect with those kids? You just make them feel what you feel when you're singing. Now, come on, you two. Help me ruin some dinner. Oh, hi. Hi. Johnny, right? Yeah. What are you playing? Oh, have a seat, have a seat. Uh, it's a new song that I've been working on for a while, uh, a long while. What's it called? I'm thinking "Wonderland." "Wonderland." Okay. Okay! I couldn't have said that better myself, and I didn't. Well, thank you. Hey, thank you. All right! It's that time. All right, everybody, take a seat, settle down. Welcome back. It's okay, I know that, yesterday, I tanked. I speak better through music. Music can say what words can't. When I was your age, I had all these thoughts and feelings that I couldn't convey, and then I found music. Or should I say music found me? You know what's so cool about music? It never goes out of style. It never goes through an awkward phase... no braces, no glasses, no bad-hair days. And when someone breaks your heart one day... not that I know anything about that... That music, those songs, will be there for you. The soundtrack of your life. Okay. On your feet! On your feet. I wanna hear what you got. Okay? So bring it! "Star-Spangled Banner." C-sharp... ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Oh, say can you see ♪ - ♪By the dawn's early light ♪ - Nice! Wow. But lose the hand gestures, Mariah. We ain't directing traffic. Posture. Stand straight. Yes. Okay, project.

Yes, yes. I can't hear you, Johnny. Oh, I don't sing. Ever? I'm just the piano man. Okay. All right! And... that's all I need to hear for today. We'll save the high note for next class. Have a seat. Have a seat, you guys. Now, a song can come out of anything. It's not just the music and the lyrics. It's the beats... the guy who makes the beats. Not that I'm getting hired to do that any time soon. But that guy, he's a writer. Oh, the girl who's delivering the coffee and passes the mic, going... ♪ "Yeah... yeah, yeah..." ♪ She's a writer. Both contributed something to the song to give it its sound. So, arrangement, production... these are all key elements in creating a hit song. So maybe you'll want to be out front, like this little star over here. Maybe you find you're good at another part of the process and you become the next Quincy Jones. The next Pharrell! Yeah! Right? Hey! Wasn't sure you were coming back. Well, it turns out you were wrong. The second day is better than the first. Oh, hey! There you go. And my work here is done. "How To Speak to Your Family." "What Will I Be When I Grow Up?" How is it that all of these apply to me? So my work here is not done. Oh! How'd your mother like the oatmeal? Oh, yeah, so I'm... I'm narrowing down to steel-cut or Cream of Wheat. Hmm. Let me know how that goes. And in case you're wondering... I don't live with my mom. It's okay if you do. You know, I was just picking her up a few things. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Wow, these are amazing. Really amazing. Who's the photographer? Ah, he's some amateur hack. Ah-ha-ha-ha! Old-school. Yep, I'm an old-school guy. So... Look, in case I... I didn't mention it before... thank you for taking time out of your life to help these kids. Yes! I thought you looked familiar on aisle two, but playing piano backwards yesterday, yeah, that pretty much sealed it. No, I guess you want to keep this quiet, what, with the hair and the clothes and the name-change. No, Del Vecchio is actually my real name. Wait. Okay. So who's "Taylor"? "Taylor's Burgers" in Brooklyn. My sister and I used to hang out there all the time. Wow, well, it's a good thing you didn't hang out at Der Wienerschnitzel. All right, all right, all right. So as long as we are... opening up the old playbook here... I danced to your music at my high school prom. I actually didn't go to my high school prom. Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me no one asked you? Yeah, that, and I didn't go to high school. Well, now's your chance. ♪ The first time ♪ ♪ In my new life is all right... ♪ Stage presence, you guys. It's a performance, not a police line-up. You guys have to own the stage. C-3PO, relax! Yeah, not that relaxed. I don't know, it's kind of like a stance. Like... Yeah. Yeah! Thanks a lot. I asked for that one. All right, you guys. That's it for today. See you tomorrow! All right, don't forget to practice. Oh, hey, Kacey. You have got such great style. Do you mind coming up with a look for the group? Uh, yeah! Of course! All right! All right! Darryl? How are you with lights? I've got Mega-Lite, Elation, and Blizzard Pro. I don't know what any of those are, but sounds good to me. All right. Cool. Hey, Ashley... Check it out. Thank you. I'll text you. Yes, please. Hey! Hey, hey. How would you like to be the DJ for our group? Me? Yeah, you. - I can do that. - Okay. Ahem. You're singing like I'm grading you. Newsflash... I'm not! I should just quit. My Mom doesn't want me doing this anyways. W-W-Wait, wait. Singing's about joy. It's about freedom. If you let the emotion flow, your voice will follow. And, while you're at it, let it pass your heart on the way up, okay? Okay. All right. Now get outta here! Hey. Hey. So, uh, you know Billy Joel was a classical pianist, and he started singing just to write his songs, and it turned out he was really good. Yeah, that's not me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you don't sing. Right. Mm-hmm. You know, my old foster mom used to play Billy Joel. That was a long time ago, though. You don't see her anymore? No, she moved. I live in a group home now, and I'm 18 in a few months, and then I'm out. Then what happens? I don't know. I have a weekend job at a hardware store, and I'm trying to get full-time. Yeah, I've been on the road since pretty much my whole life, or holed up, writing. Can you believe I actually missed my sister's wedding? 'Cause I was on tour? I missed my niece being born. I sent stuff instead of showing up. The only real relationship I've had is with my manager. Come to think of it, he's on commission. Thank you. Yes. Of course. Oh! And I thought I had a boyfriend, but that's only because I wasn't around enough to realize that I meant absolutely nothing to him. He got me a selfie stick. Oh... Not that anyone in their right mind should get involved with me. Duly noted. Wow, I've been talking a lot. How long have I been talking? Ah, yeah, that's okay. I'm here until June. And maybe you're being too hard on yourself. I mean, I don't see any other pop stars working with kids in Ohio. Yeah, about that... that wasn't really my idea. We do have, um, patient/guidance counselor privilege, right? Generally not. But I promise, I won't tell your parents. You know, I came here to, um, you know, hide out and plan my big comeback. But what if there is no coming back? Oh, there's always a way back. What if I peaked at 15? Or maybe you haven't peaked yet. You know, it's kinda late for this pep talk. Like... Like 20 years. Right. You know, I, uh, you know what I did before I was your counselor? Commodities trader in Chicago. Had the highrise on Michigan Avenue, toys, expense account... uh, and a wife, too, also a trader. What happened? She loved the life. I didn't. And turned out, she also loved someone else... my partner. Ooh! Sorry. Yeah. Thanks. Wasn't the best of times, but it worked out. And, uh, this... this is you? Crummy office, no view, cold coffee... this is me! Oh! I feel like I'm making difference here, and it's where I grew up. Today, you're a music teacher, tomorrow, who knows? My guess is, you'll be back on stage, and this'll all be a distant memory. Yeah. I think I'll remember this. Trust me. Mm. Guess the question is, are you trying to find your next hit, or... yourself? Wow. You're good. Yeah. Actually, that just came to me. Oh, yeah. Whoo! Uh... I'm afraid your time is up. My next appointment is waiting. Well, thank you very much. And! I would say it seems we're making progress, don't you think? Hello. Hello. Nice to see you taking advantage of our Guidance Program. He's helping me with a few issues. Yes. He is very helpful. And cute. I hadn't noticed. Mm. And there's nothing going on. Right, well, that is too bad, because he is the exact opposite of your usual type, which is awful, by the way. Thanks a lot. Oh, come on. Don't you remember? Your first boyfriend? The vinyl pants? Oh! Oh! And there's the one with the blue hair... Oh! Who drove over Mom's flowers? That was a scene. Should I keep going? Please don't. And what about you? What about your first boyfriend? Yes. I married him. Tim's your first boyfriend? Yeah. First one that mattered. So how much did it cost to fix your car? Don't ask. Hey, listen. Do you have a shopping list? I'm going to the market. Um... I'm making dinner for Natalie tonight. Well, Natalie's making dinner for me tonight, and you and your first boyfriend are going out. That is not necessary. It is. And it's all been arranged. All right. I'll text you a list. All-righty. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Oh, ho-ho-ho! It's a work of art! We have to Instagram this. Can we eat it first? If you want to get your following up, people love seeing photos of food. Or cats. - Why? - No one knows. Selfie! Ohh! Wow! Mom, you look fierce! She does, doesn't she? And tall! Stay out past curfew.

Keep it going. Keep it going. All right, guys. Before we start class... I realized we have to come up with a name for the group. Any ideas? How about the "Above-Average Singers"? Any other ideas?

Maybe this is my comeback. Okay. So, um, this is a limited edition. They only made 20. And it was given to me personally by Billy Joel when I performed with him at Madison Square Garden. These are the signatures of all the top acts in the country. I'll give you five grand. No, no, no, no, no. It's worth, like, 20 times that amount. Not to me. I promised I'd never sell this. Okay, okay. Um... I will let it go for ten. Eight is as high as I'll go. I'll take it. Hey, Deb! Hey! What's up? Ahem. Listen. I have a favor to ask you.

What is this? You'll see. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Come on. Welcome to... "AMP Studios"! Wow. This is yours? Ours. Bring it in, you guys! We are going to rock that prom. Two, three, four! AMP! Whoo! So what are we doing here? There's something you need to see. There's our van. Um, what do you mean "our"? Dad gave her a good deal. Insurance and permission slips, signed by all the parents. And yes, electronic signatures are authorized by the school board. Who are you? The group manager. Come on. Well? What do you think? Who's paying for all this? Billy Joel. You sold your keyboard? Yeah. Hey. You missed your appointment today. Had to give your time away to a sophomore. Wow. This guidance counselor thing is really full-service. Well, one can never get enough guidance. Ah! In my case, that actually happens to be true. So are you hungry? Because I was on my way to the market, and... How can I turn that down? Uh, you can't. Okay, so, produce then cereal? Yeah. Followed by Frozen Foods, Deli Counter, and Wine and Spirits. Oh! Oh... let's get some oatmeal for your mom. No, she's removed me from shopping detail, so... I'm getting her some anyway. All right, all right, but you've gotta hop on. Hop...? Yeah, yeah. Here we go. Oh! Yeah, you get a ride. I like this, uh, "marketing" thing. Exactly, plus you get to eat afterwards, right? Whee! Lovely night. Look at this. Candlelight... a view of the parking lot. Oh, wait. W-Wait, wait, wait. What, what, what? This...? And... the cheap romance continues. You shouldn't have. Oh... Oh! I was hoping for the plastic tiara. No, I love this. I am gonna wear it... at least until it breaks. Okay, now that is good quality plastic, so it could go five minutes. Well, here's to the next five minutes. May it feel like six. Your kids are, uh... your kids are lucky to have you. I'm pretty sure I'm the lucky one. They remind me of someone I used to know. Who's that? Me. Here we are. Ah. Oh! Your pineapple. Thank you. We'll get this clasp fixed on this... Yes, please. Expensive watch here. I had a really good time. Yeah. Me too. Me too. We should do it again. Tomorrow night? Salad Bar, Aisle 9? I was thinking prom night, gym. Um... Are you asking me to the prom? As friends. I'm... I'm chaperoning. - Friends? - Mm-hmm. Of course. You said no one in their right mind should get involved with you, so... And you listen to everybody on your couch? Always. I should tell you that my first prom was awful. And, uh, oh, I'm a really bad dancer. Oh, come on. How bad? My date left with someone else. Ooh! Oh. Now I'm gonna have to say yes. That was the plan. Uh... Oh! Goodnight, then. Goodnight. Oh, wow! I really am in high school. What happened? Well... I'm going to the prom. We're just friends. Long talks, dinners at the market... That's how it starts. Ooh! Debbie? What are you up to? Thank you. Okay... So... Do either one of these say... "prom"? Uh, no and no. Those are more me than you. I've been trying to fit in and I can't even get that right. Where's my glam-squad? I am your new glam squad. This was supposed to be a surprise. What? All right. Oh... this is gorgeous! It's so me... Thank you! But, uh... what are you gonna wear? I'm a chaperone. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter? Chaperones are allowed to have a glamorous night out, too. What? Oh, ho, ho! You are crazy.

Well, when I bought the place, this was actually a sewing room, and I kinda gave up on that, so... That's too bad. I was gonna ask you to hem my prom dress. Ooh! You got a prom dress? Guilty. Wait. What color? Why do you wanna know? So I can get you a corsage. Oh! Well, in that case... royal blue. Well, your majesty, a royal blue corsage, then. On its way! Oh. They look so happy. Yeah. So do you. Turns out I am. Mm-hmm. Here in Youngstown. In a converted sewing room. Your career is certainly on an interesting trajectory. Let's hope so. Where's all your stuff? In storage. And you never wanted a place to call home? No, no, I did. Long ago. But it was never the right time or the right place, and so here I am, just, uh... Waiting to get back into your life? Yeah. That was the plan. Huh. Well, sometimes, life is what happens when you're making plans, right? Yeah. Yeah. I wonder now if that picture I had out there is actually the life I'm meant to be living, and I don't know if it's what I want anymore. Hmm. Come on. Let's, uh... Let's take a walk. Show ya how the non-New Yorkers live. Quietly! Very quietly. Oh, it's just differently. What's going on? I was helping my mom clean out the basement. Look... at this. It's Miss D? She's beautiful. I can't believe it. Wait, here she is. "Debbie Taylor..." "The youngest person ever to write and perform a number-one single." She was our age! What's she doing teaching us? Oh, no... The kiss of death. "Debbie Taylor... Where Are They Now?" All right, you guys, let's run it from the top. Miss D? When did you start writing music? Ooh, um... Probably when I was a little bit younger than you guys, actually. Before we start rehearsal, can you sing us one of your songs? You don't want to hear that. - Come on, please? - Please! - Come on! - Come on! Okay. Ahem. What should I sing? Um... oh! Well, I'll do the first one. The first one I wrote, and I'm used to doing it as, like, an upbeat dance song, but, um, I guess I'm about to try something new. ♪ Every time ♪ ♪ I'm telling secrets ♪ ♪ I remember ♪ ♪ How it used to be ♪ ♪ And I realize ♪ ♪ How much I miss you ♪ ♪ And I how it feels ♪ ♪ To be free ♪ ♪ I see I'm up to no good ♪ ♪ And I want to start again ♪ ♪ Can't remember ♪ ♪ When I felt good ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I can't remember when ♪ ♪ No ♪ ♪ Only in my dreams ♪ ♪ As real as it may seem ♪ ♪ It was only in my dreams ♪ It's so good! Perfect! You did it! Smile for Instagram. I'll get the plates. Who needs plates? You're right. Who does? Huh. It's Ashley. She missed two college prep sessions, and now I find out she's been hanging out in some studio. I'm sorry, Mrs. Vance, but... didn't you sign a permission slip? No, and I wouldn't. Clearly, there's been a misunderstanding, and I will get to the bottom of it. I signed it. And just how do you expect to get into an Ivy League school, wasting all your time singing? Mrs. Vance. If you could just hear her, and hear the passion that she sings with... You would know it's not a waste of time. She's really good. She may... look up to you... but you're hardly a role model, are you? And you're exactly why I won't let her pin her hopes on music... a couple of hits that no one remembers, and look where you are now. Mom! Ashley, it's okay. She's right. No, she's not! In fact, I can't think of a better role model. She followed her dream. She never gave up. She's performed in front of 18,000 people holding lit candles at Madison Square Garden, and she will be back there again one day. And what are you, her publicist? No. I'm her sister. Keep singing. You have a wonderful voice. When was the last time we did this? Mm, when we were Natalie's age? You know, I never really got to tell you I'm sorry. For what? For ruining your childhood. Mom was always so focused on me. You were practically raised by housekeepers. I never blamed you for that. I mean, you were just doing what you loved. Maybe I was envious of the attention, but that wasn't your fault. You always included me. Remember that time you asked me to play tambourine in that session? Even though you knew I had absolutely no rhythm! None whatsoever. You know, I always envied your life, too. You did? Yeah. What you have with Tim and Natalie is amazing. You've built a really great life for yourself, Denise. Well, you made a pretty great life, too. Yeah... Yeah, but I never put down roots. So I have no one to come home to. Now you do. Can we just forget about the last 10, 15 years? Mm... Let's make it 20. ♪ Only in my dreams ♪ ♪ As real as it may seem ♪ Why am I seeing this online instead of from her?

I think we just got back in the Debbie Taylor business. Wake up! What is it? Your Instagram is blowing up. Look at your followers! Can you believe how many? Is that more than the kid who ate the worm? Like a zillion more! You officially have social media presence. And yet, I feel no different. Let's just check your Twitter. No. Let's get you ready for school. You sound like my Mom. Thank you. You really do. Does that mean I get to drive carpool? Can we take the van? Anything to get you moving. Come on. Are you guys ready to rock this prom? Okay, bring it in, bring it in. Two, three, four! AMP! Whoo! All right. Get some rest. You guys are gonna need it. All right, big day ahead! You got it. You got it, you got it. Hey. Hey. Well done. Whatcha got there? For you. Oh... This is the best gift I've ever gotten. Oh, well, that's hard to believe. It's true. Oh! Uh... Is that background music? Come on. You really don't dance? Well... Does the Chicken Dance count? No! Okay. Then I don't dance. Oh, boy, here we go. Okay, okay, wait. Aren't I supposed to lead? A minor technicality.

Congratulations! That is fantastic. Way to go, sis. You did it, Aunt Debbie! Okay, I hate to break up this love-fest here, but I am the work husband, and she needs to get packed, A.S.A.P. Packed? The label is flying us back. They want you in New York tonight. You are presenting at the Manhattan Spirit Music Awards tomorrow. No, no. Tomorrow's the prom. Debbie, come on, this is big. Ray, I can't just up and leave. I'll tell the kids. And I'll fill in for you backstage. Yeah. Yeah. I will, too. After all, I won't be dancing. Yeah. Come on. Ahem. I know I'm supposed to feel happier about all this... You will, once you see those pillow mints. I'm sorry, Noah. You were always going to leave. I knew that. I really thought that... Me too. But... we will always have the market, right? You were the best relationship I never had. Likewise. When I was a little bit older than you, I went to go see my very first concert, and your Aunt Debbie got me a backstage pass, and I went to go her sing, and every person in the audience was singing with her, holding a candle. It was like a sea of lights. Can I hear another story? No. Tomorrow night, okay? It's very late. Mm... I miss her. Me too, sweetie. Me too. Welcome to the Manhattan Spirit Music Awards. Would all presenters please check in? Hey! Hey, you. Hey, hi! Deb! Liam. - Hi! - Hey. I heard you were presenting. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah, they, uh, they've got me promoting this new film. Between you and me, it's, uh, ah, it's not my best work. You look great. Thank you. So do you. Thank you. You know, I miss you. I miss what we had. What did we have? Well, we had our thing, you know? Yeah. "Our thing." Listen. Uh, you want to catch up later for a drink? No. I don't think so. I'll call you. Hello, Liam. Ooh. Not him again. No. Not him. Good. Today... red carpet at 3:00, seating at 4:00. Awards at 5:00, followed by three post-award parties. And tomorrow, you do the morning shows, meet with the label, we get a little advance, and... and you're back! Debbie! It's great to see you. I love the new song. When did you write that? When I was 13. Right. Well, I always knew you had it in you. Thank you. You know, you never would've heard it, if it weren't for my kids. I didn't know you had kids. Eight of them. "Octomom." Good for you. I think you'll like the numbers. I've decided to go in a different direction. I'm sorry? I'm not signing. What do you mean? You're turning us down? You can't say no to us. Who do you think you are? She's Debbie Taylor. And when you're out of a job and someone with taste takes your place, she'll still be Debbie Taylor. I'm sorry, Ray. I couldn't do it. I mean, why can't I do this on my terms now? Have an actual life, make music, mentor these kids, tour on summer breaks, and... maybe even help one very talented kid break my record?
