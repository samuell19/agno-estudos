The Philosopher - Forms of Love Written, produced and directed by Breakfast is ready! - Breakfast is ready! - What? Breakfast is ready! I'm still showering. - Or shall I come like this? - Yes. Oh, you did it well. Can you please prepare me a sandwich? I'm in a hurry. - I've made such an effort... - I can see that. With bacon, alright? Thanks. Oh, don't look at me like that... One who loves, suffers. - Bye! - Bye! He stretched out his hand showing me three apples which it almost can't hold and were as amazingly beautiful as big. One of red, one of green and one of a yellow colour. They seemed like diamonds which were given the form of fruit. I wanted to reach for them but he said: At first you need to know that they are not for you. You should give them to the three most beautiful people in town. who then should find their ideal wives with the help of them. Will we meet again this evening? Go and do your thing well, he said, and gave me the apples in my open hands. They seemed to have gotten even bigger in the meantime. I held them against the light and found them almost translucent. I've known you 3 weeks and still don't know if we'll meet again this evening. That's life. I'm very busy. - Where am I? - Mmmh? - At my place. - Ah, yes? And who are you? Franz. Oh Franz... my head. What did I drink yesterday? Shall I make a coffee? That would be great. A coffee with a lot of orange juice. - Franz? - I'm here. Can I take a shower? Sure. Say... - Did we have sex? - Sure. It was wonderful. You are a goddess of love. Good morning. Excuse me, I'm Georg Hermes, do you have something for me today? I'm waiting for post from Frankfurt. - For Number 4? - Yes, directly the next one. Here's something. These two also. - Yes, that. - There's some more. - Thanks. - Thanks a lot. - Did you wait for it a long time? "The Love for Wisdom" Hello. Hello. Can I help you? I would like to buy some new clothes. And you thought about what exactly? I rather thought about something timeless. - Not something trendy. - Something classic. - May I show you something? - Yes please. What do you think about this one? D'you think it will last for some years? Depends on what you're intending to do with it. Why don't you just try it on? What? Shall I undress here? Seems strange to me. What do you think? - Wait a second please. - Excuse me. Of course we have dressing rooms for our customers. Would you like to try on the suit? I'll show you where to change, follow me please. Wonderful. Fits you perfectly well. As if it were made for you. - How much is it? - I'll have a look. 1198. That's too much. I can't afford it. Is it possible to borrow suits like this? I have a lecture on Sunday evening and... A suit like this would be great for that. We are proud today, to present a new author... Georg Hermes. He was born in T?bingen in 1958... studied in Heidelberg and Berlin... wrote his thesis about Heraclitus... more precisely about the fragment "Everything flows". You have to imagine that, a whole thesis about two words... He wrote a new text, "Love to Wisdom"... a guidance in thinking... or rather an invitation... an adventure in language and communication. Please, Mr. Hermes... Rational thinking is foreshadowing the consequences of one's thinking and behaviour. Being prepared... to take the responsibility for these consequences. In this sense a science... which disclaims a theory of its own consequences... and doesn't bear the responsibility for its technical and practical effects is unreasonable. Ratio comes from... human being's knowledge of its existence in time. Where does this knowledge come from? Plato says it remains hidden for the others that the ones... really urging for awareness... the philosophers, urge for death. Death is the emission out of time. If we have to live with the precognition of death... we own a knowledge which amidst of time dissociates us... from time. Only out of distance is awareness possible. But we are not able to think... to recognize, to dream, to hope to feel... The transparent experience of time is a floating... in which we are aware that at the same time we are... and we are not. To achieve this transparence and to preserve it... means to think. The art of thinking since Plato is called... Philosophy. Thank you, Georg Hermes, for this bright and interesting text. I'm almost sure... there'll be a lot of questions about this text. Here's one already. Yes, Mr. Hermes... What do you think about love? I haven't explored this feeling since my mother's death. I mean... It's a long time ago. What you talked about earlier was very fascinating for us. Especially how you talked about it, but... your response to my question really shocked me. How long is it since your mother died? It'll be eight years now. And there is no woman in your life? I may call you Georg, right? - Yes. - We'll drink to that. This is Franziska. I am Martha. And that's Beate. Cheers! It's nice we met you Georg. Say Georg you didn't answer my question. So is there a woman? No. Sometimes you appear to us like from another world. But we're getting to know you a little better now. You should visit us from time to time. We should become friends. You make me ashamed. But I must admit I also enjoy being with you. It's been a wonderful evening for me. I've never experienced three so wonderful women at one time. Say, would you like to eat with us on Sunday? - Sure - Great! You won't regret it, she's a great cook. I'll cook something very special for you. So will you be there Georg? Yes. - I know what I'd like to have. - Yes? But I don't know if you have it. - A Mouton Rothschild? - Yes I have. - You have? - Yes. A very good wine from 76 which... is well ripened, strong, soft, very aromatic. Very feminine. A wine you should decant for it to unfold... its aroma and which... brings out different tastes and smells. So then we'll have three? What else will I have? Yes, four artichoke hearts please. - Something else? - Yes, three alchemilla. And three from that Septemberkraut. - I'll add some grasses. - Yes. And also one bouquet... with five chrysanthemums... He's coming. Hello. Hello. I'm a bit too early, right? You'll have to excuse me but... I've made it a habit always to be on time. No problem. Come inside. Food is almost finished. Hello Georg. - It smells excellent. - Thanks. My god, it's big here. And so bright. Come on, we will show you the apartment in the meantime. This is Franziska's room. Beautiful. One never wants to leave here. More hot? - It's good like this? - Yes, thanks. I don't know what else to say anymore. - Wine? - Wait a second. - Thanks. - Enjoy your meal. You know... all forms of asceticism have always fascinated me. Monks, hermits... Then, with a paper on Heraclitus, I made this dream come true. For almost six months I lived on an island in the Aegean. Right on the western Turkish coast, Agatholithion. In the morning, where the sun rose... it assumed Ephesus. And in the evening, it sank in Poseidon's empire. Once in a month I went to the village to pick up... the most essentials for my small cave. And my only reading in that time... were the handed down words of Heraclitus. I read them over again and again... wanting to immerse myself in them... Even if the Dionysiac arts are not my field... this wine is wonderful. Every single swallow tastes a bit different. It's like a broad stream... in which all ditches and rivers live on. This wine is like you, Franziska. If I were a vampire... and drank your blood, I assume it would taste like this wine. Dear Franziska, I am sitting in my favorite spot by the water... having to think about you all the time. I think I fell in love with you! I am helpless. It's nice to get such a letter at a time when everybody just makes phone calls. If you picked me up from work tomorrow we could go in for something. Figure something out, I'll leave it all up to you. I trust in you and enjoy spending time with you. With hugs, Franziska Good evening. Franziska has a customer right now, it will take her another 10 minutes. - Wouldn't you like to come inside? - No, thanks. You know, you could also accompany Martha and me. No, I prefer to wait outside. It's just that we all like you very much. As you wish. Would you like to drive? I'm not able to drive, I never learned. Then get inside. Where are we going? What did you decide? Boating. How did you know that I like water so much? As a child, I spent every single minute in and around water. Come a bit closer, you are so far apart. I can't... I can't swim... Come on. Breathe. You saved my life Franziska. The Chinese say that I'm yours now. It is said... that now you may do with me whatever you want. Good. Can you make a fire? I always can, even when it rains. Then start with that. I need leaves and wood. Georg you have to undress or you'll catch a cold. I'll carry on with that. Your underpants also... But I'm ashamed. Do you think I never saw a naked man? Georg? I'd like to sleep with you now. I've never slept with a woman. Doesn't matter. I'll show you. - Here? - This is my home. Have you read all of these? More or less. - Up there I sleep. - Do you have an iron? - I'd like to iron my clothes. - Yes. Here you are. I don't use it so often. - Here you are. - And where is the iron? I'm quite confused. You should also iron your clothes dry. They will be dry tomorrow. Would you mind if I stayed here for tonight? No. On the contrary. But the bed is very narrow. I'll nestle up against you. You're a wonderful man. I think it's hot enough now. Georg you can't stay here. It's much too dark. You'll become all melancholy. Why don't you move into my place? We have a spare room. A wonderful place for all your books. And there's much more light too. What about Beate, Martha? They'd be delighted if you moved in. They like you very much. You wouldn't have to pay rent anymore and could buy even more books. I can't accept that. No? Here please. And the other one over there. That's your new writing desk Georg. It's a gift from me. We want you to write many wonderful books. I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to thank me. I thank you for having come to us. What's up? Are you dissatisfied? - No, on the contrary, I'm very happy. - Good. I'll just bring in my books and then... - I'll directly begin my writing. - You shouldn't. Beate will buy you a pc and then writing will happen by its own volition. And I will make you some tea. That was excellent. - I'm full now. - Wouldn't you like to have one more? No thank you. - Should I prepare coffee? - Not for me. Or should I explain the computer to you? Don't be angry on me but... I'm very tired. It was an exhausting day for me. - I'd like to go to bed early tonight. - I can understand that. Tomorrow then. Morning anyway is the best time to work. - Wait, let me help. - Leave it be, Martha will do it. Come on, let me show you where to sleep. - But that's your room... - Yes. And you will also sleep here? Would you like that? Yes. Then undress. You chose the apartment for sure. - Because of the water, right? - True. Good night. Good night. Good night Georg. Sleep well. Good night. Good morning. Wake up for breakfast. Wake up. Did you sleep well? Wait, I'll put the cushion behind you. Am I awake or dreaming? I brought the newspaper too. If you want to be informed about what happens in the world. "Strauss pressures Kohl again." "Strauss rejects the Bonn plans for retirement financing." - No problem. - I'll take care for it. "The coalition is coping with profound financial problems." "900 Policemen evacuated the Lenn? Triangle." "Occupants climbed over the walls." Ah I know, I'll read you the words for Sunday. "In earlier times, beautiful women automatically had to be stupid." "Nowadays, also beautiful men can be stupid." "Philosophers are people not noticing what they see because... they only care about what they don't see." Bernard de Fontenelle. - Did you type that in? - I did it for you... If you want to write something you take the mouse... and move it here... and there. Alright. A blank document opens. Then you can write like a typewriter. This is upper and lower case. And this is the space bar. Here you are. Now you can print it. With the mouse... over there. Print... yes. And now... okay. "Everything flows." Heraclitus. Here you are. So now you can write. I have to go. If you're hungry, the freezer is full. We won't come back before this evening. Thanks. I'm gonna stay and watch you writing. I can only work when I'm alone. Will you try? You... Do you want... to seduce me? Yes! I love Franziska. Don't you love me also? Now you have to close your eyes. You may not open them again, alright? - Swear. - I swear. - You're blinking. No? - No. Are you scared? - Don't blink. - I didn't. Alright, now... stop. Now. - Open? - Yes. I can't. It won't work. I'm in love with Franziska. I have to tell you something, Franziska. Beate wanted to sleep with me this morning. So what? So what? Why didn't you do it? Didn't you feel like it? Doesn't Beate appeal to you? Yes... You said it as if you were sorry I didn't do it. But I'm in love with you, Franziska. What you imagine as love Georg... is just a made up fantasy. You can love me, Beate, Martha... all people. Plants, animals, the whole world. The world is an entity. And love is the force holding that world together. For sure you were scared you'd lose me. But you can't lose me. I love you Georg and I will always love you. Exactly as Beate, as Martha. Something's wrong with you three. Georg let's make an arrangement. I will always tell you the truth. I'll never lie to you. Do you believe me? I don't know why... but I believe you. Good. How did all this start? We had a mission. The mission was to find you. Now we've found you. We will give up our store once again and live together with you. The store was just a mouse trap. And I was the mouse. Yes... you could say that. Does it make you angry? And how is this supposed to go on now? We don't know yet. We will be together with you... and love you as long as you live. Who are you? We are agents in time. We are coming from another time. Or let's say there exists no specific time for us. We are immortal, just like your soul. Can you imagine that? You've read too many sci-fi novels... Do you really think so Georg? No. But how did you come here? With a time machine? You have problems... I'm freezing, you see, like other people also. We were born, exactly like you. And we will leave this earth, these bodies... exactly like you. You mean to die. Yes. When my soul is immortal... and you're immortal too... where is the difference between you and me? I know who I am. You'll have to find out. I think I'm going crazy. You don't have to be scared Georg. I'm here. And I love you. My dear ones... don't worry about me... but I have to be on my own for some days. Don't search for me. Georg - You have to tell me when you have something on. - Don't worry. Life concedes women. Death concedes men. Forget it. - Can you lend me 1,000 Marks? - Of course. - Right now. - Thanks. Good evening. I'm looking for a single room. Do you have a free one? A single room? And how long do you need it? For three nights. Yes there is one. It's 60 Marks a night, breakfast included. I'll take it. I enjoyed your music. It's beautiful. It touched you. Waiting for something? Time, low tide and high tide... wait for no one. Do I disturb you? Now you ask me... yes, you do. Hello. How may I help you? - A clinical thermometer please. - Of course. I can show you three. This first one is very fast measuring. Secondly this old one which you of course know... and finally this digital one, also fast measuring and break-proof. - The simple one please. - Sure. Martha? I'm in a hotel. I'm sick. Georg. My stuff is in the cupboard. From now on we'll all sleep together here. You need warmth Georg. Good morning. Coffee or tea? Coffee. - Tea. - Coffee. Is there a God? Yes. But there are other gods also. And goddesses. It depends on your point of view. We... are goddesses. I still don't know if I should believe you. Georg Hermes... Do you think your name is a coincidence? You're a messenger of the gods. You just don't know yet. Also for you there is neither space nor time. Tomorrow we're gonna make a picnic. At the Wannsee.
