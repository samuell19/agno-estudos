There is a girl tied up to the ceiling. She is unconscious. I don't know exactly what happened to her. Her hands are tied together with a rope. We can hear there are people around, but I don't know who they are. She wakes up, very slowly. Her head hurts like hell. She wonders where she is, what's going on. She tries to remember how she got there. She was walking in the woods, and then it all turned black. These people around, what are they gonna do to her? Are they mad, will she get killed? Will she get raped? God, she doesn't even want to think about it. She's a nice girl. She did nothing wrong. Shit, they're coming! This is a bad dream. I want to wake up, I want to get free. Shit! No, no! Oh god! What the fuck was that? I feel strange. That thing is moving inside me. I can't think straight anymore. Do you know who that girl is? Yes. Who is she? It's me. Are you dead? Not yet. Tell me more about these bad guys. They're very strange. They wear these strange masks. Is that what you're scared of, the masks? No. What scares me is what they do. It all happens in this big, dark forest. Somebody is in danger. They're gonna kill her and feed her to the beast. What beast? The girl that runs in the forest, she's my heroine. Her name is Natty. She knows there's something wrong going on in that forest. She's seen strange things happening, but she didn't get too close. She doesn't know about the abductions, about the monster. She lives with two other girls in a big house right in the middle of the forest. One of these girls is tattooed, poetry, Dylan Thomas. I always wanted to get a tattoo. Her name is Cassie. She owns the place with her lover Davie. Hey, Natty. Hey. What's up? There's definitely something weird going on at that place. There are people working all the damn time. I don't think they ever stop. They have lights going on at night. They're constantly moving during the day. They're wearing coveralls, respirator things. They keep on carrying these plastic sacks down the cellar. It doesn't look like any sort of renovation I've ever seen. We keep making small things, what about making something big? How would you feel about that? And what did you have in mind, my dear? Well, me and Natty have been talking, and she found that really weird house. Yeah, you guys were saying something about that. There's all these really great YouTube series and it's a great way to break into acting. So I was thinking - make a movie of our own? - Yeah. Yeah, I mean I haven't really had an opportunity to kinda go off on my own. You can be my star! I would love that. We should! All three of us, we're all smokin' hot so any time there's pretty girls on camera it goes pretty well. Yes, it does. Let's see if we can talk Natty into some of it. I bet she's down. She always is down for adventure. Yeah. Girl is crazy. We already hang out with her. We already go out and do stuff with her, and I know you love spending time with her, so this would be a great way to kinda capitalize on it. And then my favorite girl, and my other favorite girl, it could be like a trio. Hi. Hi. There's my favorite! We were thinking about the house that you found, - that kinda spooky one. - Oh, yeah. We were thinking, since she does the camera stuff, and since both of you, all of us are so fuckin' hot, I was thinking about maybe doing like a web series. Ah, yes. Sneaking spies, Charlie's Angels. You know you are so curious about what's going on over there. - You know you wanna know. - Of course I am! I mean it would be a lot easier to do something about it if there is something bad going on. If we got it on film. Alls we have to do is go over there, get a quick look. I can just stick the camera over the fence. I mean really, what's the worst that could happen? We get in, we get out. Ask for a glass of water. If nobody says anything, just keep going. Well, if no one's there, you can definitely let us know. We'll hurry, we'll help, - ish. - Ish! We will kind of run part of the trail. Just get there and let us know what's going on. We all know what we're doing tonight, right? I know what I'm getting into. Sneaking up to the really spooky house with god knows what going on in it. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty clear. Are we set? I think we're set. Make sure you go down under the deck. Let's do it. Do you know why they picked that night in particular? It was a full moon. They hadn't seen the dark clouds coming. It rains heavily on them. When Natty gets to the house the rain has almost stopped. She will go inside first just to have a look. If everything's okay the other girls will go in too. Where did that come from? From underground. Deeply underground. There is something. Is that the monster you were talking about? Yes. That's the monster they feed. And the three girls, did they get caught? No. They got scared of the sound and ran home. The next day they looked at what they recorded on the camera. Look. What is that? I don't know. I can't make that image at all. Can you sharpen, like zoom in or something? It's still fuzzy. I don't know. It's just too dark to see anything well. We need to go back. That's why we're going back, I mean, we do it in the daylight. Oh, god, it's moving. I thought it was a tree. No. That's spooky. We were so close though. I mean I love your camcorder, but it's not great at distance shots. That's crazy close. I want to get on the other side of that fence. They are not so sure now. Maybe it's not so exciting anymore. Now they're scared. But everybody's ashamed to be scared. They don't have the strength to say to the others, I don't want to do it anymore. And what's Natty gonna think of them? She wants to go back. That's why they won't let it go. You know this time, if it's all clear with Natty, I think we should go over the fence. Definitely. I want to see what's in that house. I want to see what's in the tent. They'll never see what's in the tent. What will happen to them? The day after, they decided to go back. It was a sunny day. They've decided to use their phones as walkie-talkies. Can you guys hear me? Natty's phone will be on at all times so Davie and Cassie would be able to hear what's going on. The problem was that Natty couldn't hear them in return. Anyway, the plan was that Natty would go first, of course, while the others waited some distance from the fence. They'll wait for Natty to tell them it's okay to come. In the meantime, they'll shoot some video of the forest. There may be something weird going on in these woods. Ready? Yeah. Okay. Hello? Hello? Hello? Davie, run! Anyone home? That's when the real nightmare starts. Does it scare you, this nightmare? It's a bit different from fear. It makes me feel like my heart's gonna blow or something. But I do kind of like that feeling. What feeling exactly? The feeling of being in danger. To live something for real. To be outside your comfort zone. To be in a situation where you don't know how it's gonna end. You mean you like the idea of being in a situation of peril? I guess so, don't you? I don't know. Well if there's a war, would you go fight? Probably. I guess you wouldn't have much of a choice on that. But if you saw someone getting beat up in a dark street at night, would you go help them? I'll probably. It depends. It's not an easy choice, choosing to close your eyes, go home, maybe get some bad sleep, or choosing to be brave, going into that street to help. You might get beat up too. You might get kidnapped. I think it's pretty exciting. Exciting to be kidnapped? Well, yeah, lots of people fantasize about being abducted. Do they? Anyway, let's get back to the story. The drones, that's what I call them, heard something in the white plastic tent. Who are they? Servants of the creature. They feed it and defend it. That's what they're programmed to do. They're like zombies, except. Except? Except for the girl. She is smarter than the others. She gives orders. I am still in that fucking cell. It's been a few days now. I can't breathe. I'm dying. I died a few minutes after the fight. I wasn't meant to become a drone. They threw my body in to feed the beast. It's weird to look at yourself as a sack of meat and bones. But that's what we are really. After that they took Davie and Cassie in. Where the fuck am I? My head hurts so much. Oh, shit! Where is Davie? I was with her when we got attacked. What the fuck happened to Natty? Am I gonna die? Fuck, I don't wanna die. Is she going to die, like you? No. Not like me. I was never meant to become a drone. But Davie had some different reactions to that fucked up process. They put her back in her cell. Transformation could take some very long hours. Her brain, she feels like her brain is melting. She can't think straight anymore. And that thing in her belly, she can feel it move. It's a part of her now. And what happened to Natty? Natty is unconscious in the cell right next to hers. She is seriously injured. Oh, god! Hey! Hey! Tell me what the fuck is in the pool! Okay? What's in the pool? What the fuck is in the pool? Huh? Huh? Huh? What's in the pool? Tell what you've done with my friends! Huh? Tell me! Shit! You piece of shit! Alright. What is in the pool? What am I going into? What have you done with them? No! Hey. Hey. Davie, hey! Davie, hey, we gotta go! Okay, come on! Come on! I gotta get you. Okay. Come on. This way. Come on. Okay, just look at me. You can make it up the stair, yeah. Go on, I got you. You got it? Then I woke up. I see. And what do you think all that means? I think it means it's time for me to live some adventures. Our lives are so boring. Wake up five days a week, get to the office, always get the same crappy coffee, say hello to everyone. I'm sick of it. All my days are the same. I want to be scared. That's why people watch horror movies, I guess. I want to be in danger, to be tied up, to struggle, to fight. Do you know people actually pay to get kidnapped? I didn't know that. Still, it's fake. I have to go now.
