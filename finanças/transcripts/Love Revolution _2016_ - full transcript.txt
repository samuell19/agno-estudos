Based on a book from thousands of years ago, women were created from men. 24 hours ago, I didn't really buy that. When God made women, men gave up a rib. But there's a kind of woman, even if the boyfriend has not given up crap she'd remain totally devoted. Oh my God! This woman believes love should be like a revolution. Earthshaking and unforgettable. I beg you... let my boyfriend go, I'll do anything. “Yoshida Ai" Crap! Cleaned out again. "Toranosuke" Move aside! No... Let me go! Get up! I'm sorry! I didn't know better, please go easy on me. I already broke up with Ai, but she wouldn't leave me alone. How dare you blame it on her! Let's see how amazing your dick is. Stop, Miss Yoshida! AU.! AU.! After them! Right! After them! Hurry, this way! Where did they go? Go look over there. Jin, are you OK? Are you hurt? Ai! Calm down! I can kiss my dick goodbye if they catch us. Jin, if you really love me, there's nothing to be afraid of. Yes, but... I pissed off Toranosuke. I'm dead. We better lay low for a while. What should we do? I know... My pal wants me to take a shipment to Bangkok. I can't live off you forever. Maybe I'll take the job. Don't haggle over money with me. It's not a bad idea. I have never been to Bangkok. Let's go on the run. That's so romantic. No... AU.! But... I'm such a loser. I don't have money for plane tickets. But I do. I stole from the old geezer. This should be enough for us in Bangkok. AU.! You're so sweet! I love you! I love you too! I love you to death! Where is Ai? I'm sorry! Miss Yoshida got away. You can't even find a girl, moron? You're no different from Yamazaki. Just another piece of garbage! I'm so sorry! "A year ago" Yamazaki, I gave you a job. Did you do it? No women, no kids. I don't speak English, asshole. Spare me your killer act. I don't hurt women or kids. Mayumi! This udon is crap! Fuck off! I'm sorry! Listen, As of today, you're banished from Japan. Without my permission, you're not allowed to come back. Is that clear? Understand? "Bouso Yamazaki" "Thailand" The Bible says women came from men. But... I know a man who lives his life for women. “Yu" Yu is a graduate student. It was love at first sight when he met Pearl. He gave her money to open a tattoo shop. But triad Boss Mustache Lin also fell for Pearl. He framed Yu in order to get rid of him. He had him arrested. But, Yu escaped this morning. Because he also believes love is like a revolution. For Pearl and for love, I'll sacrifice anything. Shinji! Hey! Long time no see! My girlfriend Ai! Hello! Hey! You're looking good. Hey! What? Let's go have some fun. Where are you going? We have something to do. Wait here. Don't be long. What's taking them so long? Hey! I'm Japanese, 2 Japanese guys... Understand? 2 men? Yes! Gone to A GO GO. A GO GO!? Yes! I want to go there. Understand? Understand. Understand. Hello! What is it? Was my boyfriend here? What? Hold on... Look“. Come here, girls. Is that the asshole? Is that him? Yes! He hit me! It's him! Who are you? Yoshida Ai. Was my boyfriend here? Your boyfriend? This asshole trashed up the bar and beat up my men. What did you say? I don't understand. "2 hours ago" Please let my boyfriend go. Not so fast! He's on his way to see SIR. I'm afraid he'll lose a finger. SIR? Who? Who is he? Don't go out there! If you go outside, everything will go down the drain. You'll be shit out of luck. Fuck you! "Ferguson" When Ferguson was still Fei Sir, he was just a punk. The Red Devils were down 1 goal with 3 minutes to go. Even a tie is hopeless, let alone a win. But Fei Sir was blasted that day and dreamt that the Red Devils would win. He bet the triad's fortune on the Red Devils. Red Devils! Are you crazy? You're doomed. But a miracle happened. The Red Devils won 2:1. And Ferguson became a firm believer of numerology. Mustache Lin has been missing for days. Everyone knows we don't get along. I can't show my face in the next few days and if I deal with Ki on the side if word got out, I'd be crucified and ridiculed. Your self palace is weak in the next 3 days. To play it safe, you must be patient. Then it'll be smooth sailing from here onwards. Good! Fuck you! Ki! Here's my last offer. USD$500K. Take it or leave it. I don't deal with assholes. What game are you playing now? Fine! I have chicks right here. Take your pick. Get up! Hurry... Get in line! Hurry up! Stand properly! Take your time. Who are you? I want her. But she's not one of mine. She's the one I want. Who is she? Her boyfriend trashed our bar. SIR? Why should we deal with that woman? She stole the goods from Mustache Lin. Mustache Lin wants $3M, Ki wants $500K. Understand? Asshole! You don't know what goods they're trading. How can you deal with Ferguson? Who cares? It's up for grabs. "Double cross Ki" Double Boss Ki, is Cambodian. She was a chemist who made drugs. But then she realized the cost is high in any business. Now she's only interested in free deals. Pearl, it's me. I escaped. I heard Mustache Lin's thugs are looking for him. For you, I'll settle with him once and for all. You must wait for me. I love you! Please let my boyfriend go. I'll do anything. Please... Really? Yes! I won't renege. Listen, take this money do a deal for me. If everything pans out, I promise I'll let your boyfriend go. Really? That's it? Yes! What do you expect? Nothing! I thought... you'd ask for something sleazy, like forced prostitution or a roll in the sack. Moron! All's well after today. Get going! You want a photo op? Yamazaki honey! You're too lazy. Buck up! That's right, Yamazaki. Listen to Ruby. Our lower bodies are counting on you. You've been bumming around for 6 months. Have you forgotten? You're Bouso Yamazaki. I will try. I can't help it if I don't have a chance. Go look for one. Moon and I will support you. Give Full Metal Min a call. Again? That'll be too humiliating. Who cares? One should be flexible. Go for it. Don't be a pain! Alright... It's freaking hot, the fan doesn't work? Sorry, it's broken. "Full Metal Min" You're Full Metal Min? We're the Bill brothers. Razor sent us. Says you have the best products. What the fuck is going on? It's no big deal. I need to tidy up my shop for business. You know, I'm a neat freak. OK, back to business. OK, business... You want a ('flock 17. Right, it's stable and bullets won't get stuck. But it becomes slippery when wet. It's not suitable for Thailand. So, I suggest a different gun. The Beretta 92F. It's easy to handle even for sweaty hands of white trash. Mind your words. Forget it! Let me see the 92F. Hello? Min, it's Yamazaki. Bouso Yamazaki? I'm busy. I can't talk right now. I need a job. Help me out, we're fellow Japanese. But you said my commission was too high. I'm sorry, I was wrong. I need money to pay for 2 women's surgery. What was that? No big deal. Just 2 white dogs making a mess. Really? Please help me out. Right! I'll be in touch. Razor is nothing but trouble. Cough it up! Miser! What are you doing, boys? Move! You're not coming with me? Get in! Move! Hi! You're Japanese? Yes! OK, where's the money? Money? Here... Good, come here. Nobody moves! Throw me the money. I don't understand. Don't listen to him, get over here. Scholes, take it easy. Ki, I knew you stole the goods. Cough it up if you know any better. Hand over the Boss as well. Not my goods anymore. Scholes, give me the goods and the Boss. Are you mad? Your Boss is none of our damn business. I don't care, that's our goods. It's out of control... Help, Morn! Help! Cut it out, you lecher. You're Japanese? Yes! You're not Thai. Why do you speak Japanese? I was an exchange student in Japan, that's why I speak a little Japanese. Why are you hanging outwith these thugs? It's a long story. I see. How sweet of you. You too. You sacrificed for love. That' s so cool! But... I must go back and save my boyfriend. Please stop the car. Stop the car. What? What is it? I can't stop it. What? I don't know, it won't stop. Why? It just won't. Try again. Turn it. No problem. Great! What the Hell... What's wrong? Why did you stop, moron? Cops are coming! Drive! I can't. It won't start. Drive! Hurry! Drive! Hurry... we're dead. What's wrong? Why did you stop? We're leaving. Sorry... No problem! Are you Japanese? Yes. Hello! You're so cute! I love Japanese girls. Thank you. They're so adorable. Thank you. She's armed. Frisk her. What? Armed? You! Get out. What are you hiding behind you? Show me. Hands up! Take it out... It started. Where are you going? Hey, come back! Stop... Calm down! Don't scream. Sorry! Damn! After her! Where did she go? Hey! Stop! Over here! Come back! After her! Sorry! Out of the way! Sorry! I'm sorry! My king rooster! I don't care, you must pay for them. You killed my rising star! I'll sue you. You broke their legs and scared the others to death! They'll need counseling now. What do you say? Pay up... hurry! Step aside... I don't understand. No one is picking up. Answer the phone! You can't find Ai? What a bunch of losers! Don't move! You can't pay for this! You're so stupid! I'll kill you... Boss! What? Did you find her? Yes. Miss Yoshida... What? Spit it out! Miss Yoshida went to Bangkok with Jin. Bangkok? Call Min. Yes! Toranosuke-San, what can I do for you? Min, find a girl for me. No problem. What's the reward? $100K. In USD, not KRW. Don't worry! You can count on me. Good! Hurry up or I won't pay you. I'll send you the file. I wouldn't dare ask for money if I don't hurry. Comfy? You're the best, baby. Hello? Put Yamazaki on the phone. Yamazaki, telephone! Hello? It's me. Min? I have a job for you. Find a Japanese girl for me. Great! I'll take it. USD$10,000. Yes or no? That's not much. What? Fine! I'll get someone else. Wait... that's not what I mean. I'll do it. Good. I'll send you the file. Thanks for your help. Blood sucker! USD$10,000. For the sake of your lower bodies, Bouso Yamazaki will do anything. USD$100? I don't have change. Keep the change. Really? Thank you. Here it is. Pear“.! Pear“.! What? Yu? What are you doing here? I escaped. You broke out of jail? Yes, I did it for you. For me? You didn't have to, I can wait. But I can't. Besides, I found out Mustache Lin framed me. I want revenge. Wait! Why would he do that? We'll get to that later. It's not safe here. Pack your things, we have to run. I don't care how, make that Japanese girl cough up the goods. Or else, you can all go to Hell. Wait! Remember what I said? Everything will be fine after today. Great! I'll listen, for the last time. If I don't strike gold after today, you're dead. Wait... what are you doing? Where are you taking me? Let me go... help! Where am I? Shut up and don't move! They already explained she took Ferguson's money to do a deal. They exchanged fire with Mustache Lin's thugs and killed Ferguson's men. What should we do? Ask her about the goods and the money or else we're fucked. Hey! Who are you? Why do you have a Police gun? What? Armed robbery? Speak up! What? I don't understand what you're saying. Let me... Where are you from? Can you speak English? No, speak Japanese, moron! Talk to me in Japanese. Moron... How dare you hit me! Don't bully a woman! Let me go! I must save my boyfriend. I'm innocent. Let me go! What a pain! How can we make her talk? No... I can't do it. I jumped the gun and I regret it now. Only a loser would hit a woman. I hate men like that. Only a loser would hit a woman. You... what's going on between you? You were Mustache Lin's woman. I slept with you both. But that won't affect Ki and I. Pearl, I love you. Ki, you think you'll get away with this? You betrayed Mustache Lin, he'll come after you. Mustache Lin? You want to see him? You mean... you tried to deal without the goods? I meant to bring them, but he died of a heart attack. OK, so forget the goods. I'll just con Ferguson's money. Old geezer, tell us or you'll be sorry. Where are the goods for Ferguson? OK! OK! Actually... It's... You just made another enemy. I killed Mustache Lin, I'm not afraid. Unlike you, Ki is not fussy. Hurry up and tell us. What? Money. Ferguson's money. Ferguson's money? I... You were with the Jap, you must have it. I don't. I left with her, but she took the money. He came on a bike. Go check it out. What are you doing? Shit! They took my gun and busted my head! What's wrong with this bike? Jim, they took the Jap to the den. Go get your gun. Where is the den? Civilian Night Club in Chinatown. Got it! I'll ask around. They're looking for a Japanese girl. Hello? Zhang? They're looking for a Japanese girl. She came to the night club and someone died. Take her to Chinatown. Chinatown. Ruby. What? Great! Hello, handsome. Ruby is looking for a girl, help her out. You can count on me. Hurry! Jean, Civilian Night Club in Chinatown. Civilian Night Club in Chinatown. Civilian Night Club in Chinatown. Yamazaki honey! I also found out Mustache Lin's mistress owns a tattoo shop. Maybe he's hiding out there. You'll get a huge reward if you find him. I'll get the Japanese girl first. Get me the address of the tattoo shop. I'll check it out later. There! Bouso Yamazaki is back! Before I beat you up, let me tell you about me. I came to Bangkok from the U.S. I've been married 4 times. But all my wives ran out on me. I became the laughing stock in Bangkok. They call me the King of Runaway Wives. Pretty lady, don't bother to beg. My job is to beat you up. I don't care about anything else. Just like me and my wives, we're on different channels. Come out! Come out! Sorry! Perfect! Lok, I'm surprised you came to see me. Bouso Yamazaki? I found her. Good job. The Boss was just asking about her. Let him take a look. You!? You know each other? What a small world. You want this Japanese girl? Are you jealous? She's mine. You want her back? I see... she's the mistress! That's wonderful! Min, this old geezer is the reason I'm stuck here. Thanks to him I have forgotten the taste of udon. Right in front of you, I'll rape her to vent my anger. What? If you dare touch her, I'll level your home and have you sodomized. Wait... please calm down. Let's talk about this. Old geezer, watch me fuck her. What can you do about it? Wait! Take it easy, Yamazaki. This angle is no good. You're in the light. Go over there... Let's begin. Bitch! If you don't get her back. I'm not paying YOU- Of course. That's fair. What if I kill Yamazaki for you? You're a shrewd entrepreneur. I'll give you another $100K. Not KRW, in USD. USD$100K. Deal! Stop! Stay back! Help... stop it! No... Wise up or I'll kill you. I'd rather die. I must be faithful to my guy. Does is matter, idiot? I'm starving! Delicious! You win. It's delicious. I'm Yamazaki, what's your name? AU.! Mr. Yamazaki, please let me go. I really missed my boyfriend. You love him that much? Yes, I'm willing to die for him. Really? Why? Jin? I came to pick you up. Thank you. You're not scared of Toranosuke? Why should I be? Let's go. That's why I must save the man I love. The man you love. The man you love. You may go. What? Thank you. But... I can't save my boyfriend without the money. You can, if you have Ferguson's Last Gum. Last Gum? What's wrong with you? You don't know what goods they're trading? Chewing gum. Chewing gum worth USD$500K? Yes! This is soccer giant Ferguson's Last Gum. Chewing gum... Where is it now? Mustache Lin's mistress owns a tattoo shop. It should be there. Mr. Yamazaki, can you help me find the chewing gum? What? Please? I'm such a sucker. Thank you, Mr. Yamazaki. Yamazaki baby. Fuck! Run... What is it? Use the GPS to find the tattoo shop. Why? You're not coming with me? Sorry! I think I'm in trouble. Really? But I can't do this without you. A woman even I can't conquer should be fine. Be careful! Chang! Anything? No! Want something to drink? I want something cold. Pear“.! I lied to you, why did you save me? I don't know... A woman's instincts, maybe. Chewing gum! Have you seen any chewing gum? What? Chewing gum? LAST GUM ! Ferguson's gum. The Ferguson from the U.K., not Thailand. They were trading Ferguson's Last Gum. I can save my boyfriend if I find the Last Gum. What? A piece of chewing gum? Exactly! Have you seen it? It should be here... Is that it? Old man, another duel! Again? It happens every week. Are you really going in? I must save my boyfriend. I admire you. You found the love of your life. Go for it! Thanks. What is it? You don't think I should leave either? You turned Bangkok upside down in a day and got my men killed. I had no choice. Where are the goods? Let my boyfriend go. Where's my money? Need you ask? It's gone. You were supposed to pay for the goods. But you destroyed the goods. What can you use to trade your boyfriend? With love. Charge! I'll kill you! Let my boyfriend go. What? What is it? I'm sorry... I think I made a mistake. It's raining. I have to go. Something came up. You were supposed to spend the day with me! I'll call you. Don't go... Ai. Ai, I can explain. It's not what you think. Drinking is necessary when a man is entertaining. I'm only doing this for our future. Thank God I'm not injured. Sorry! Fuck you! You're enjoying your retirement. But I'm in deep shit. Go to Hell, asshole! Are you OK? How did you find me? I don't know. It brought me here. I can't believe we're both losers in love. An hour ago you were lecturing me how to fall head over heels in love. I admit I was wrong. I don't think I'll ever fall in love again. Really? Are you sure? Yes. You think there's someone out there worth loving? That's right. Your girlfriend's name is Pearl? How did you know? You must love her very much. You're a nice guy. Are you hungry? I only had a turkey leg the whole day. I know a place that has great Tom-Yum-Goong. You want that? Yes. But do you have money? No, we'll worry about that later. My name is Ai, what's your name? Yu. Yu? Cute name. Let's go. I have never read the Bible. But I believe a woman came from a man's rib. Or else why would she hold him tightly when she meets the man she loves? Where's everyone? We meet again!
