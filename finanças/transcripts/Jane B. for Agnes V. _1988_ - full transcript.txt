This image is very calm, timeless, motionless. Yet time seems to be passing, drop by drop. Each minute, each second, weeks, years. I distinctly remember... my 30th birthday. I was alone in London. The children had stayed in France. I was making a movie in England. I was alone in my room, in bed, drinking a bottle of sherry... Sickly sweet stuff. I drank, then I felt sick. I crawled on my hands and knees to the bathroom, to the toilet, to puke in the toilet. I pulled... the thingamajig. Then I saw in the john little bits of carrots floating about, so I flushed again. Off to one side, I saw some socks hanging from a rack. I took them to wipe my face which was red and tearful. I saw myself in the mirror and said, "Shit! "So this is 30! "Ifs not a pretty sight!" Jane b. by Agnes v. B. for Birkin v. for Varda 2 questions: Do you like being filmed? Talking about yourself? Yes. And no. I like relating with the director, finding out what he wants. But sometimes... I don't know the rules of the game. In wanting to give my all, I really try to drown myself. They rescue me and say no. "Be phony, that was too real." Sometimes ifs the other way round. What will you ask me? Which questions? Real or phony? Want a drink? Coffee. I've noticed in photos and interviews, you never look at the camera. Why? I don't like the hole! Look at it. Ifs embarrassing. Why? It's too personal. Why? Like staring at someone. It's too personal. Maybe it's a mirror. Others don't look at you in a mirror, you look at yourself. Exactly. I'm filming your self-portrait. But you won't be alone in the mirror. There'll be the camera... which is a bit me. Never mind if I appear in the mirror or the background. I'll look at you, but not the camera. It could be a trap. I don't want to trap you, corner you. But a film shows 24 portraits a second or per hour. You must play by the rules. Look at the camera as much as you can. Look into it. Otherwise you won't be looking at me. I'm trying! - You agreed to do the film? - Yes, boss! Action! If a painter or a filmmaker wants to do my portrait, I don't mind distortion. Ifs like with you. What counts is the eye behind the camera, the person holding the paint brush. I don't care what you do to me, as long as I feel you like me. Why a film with you? You're beautiful. Like a chance encounter on an editing table between a tomboy Sloane Ranger and a plasticine Eve. I agreed to act for you and be your model... modestly. But I suspect myself. I'm not so sure I agreed out of modesty. Let's start with a traditional portrait a la Titian or a Ia Goya. You're stuck on money! Some princesses speak in jewels, but when you speak, cash rules! You were asking for it! You're infuriating! You claim you looked for the cash! It's in a book? Look at me! Which book? Truth in eyes is worse than lies. I'm looking at a real looker! The only hitch, you wanna be rich, not be with me. I want you! - Knock it off and look! - I am. Then find it, don't look. As Picasso... used to say. Damn! You lost $15,000.. In cash! You told me to stash the cash. Look at this red... Blood! Beautiful the way it spurts! And the Hockney blue! The color of parking tickets. Clear blue. "Big Splash" Swimming pool blue. California blue! All Hockney blues are beautiful. The swimming pool freak. It's all drivel. He's got his pool, I've got my stripes. You're finally selling, don't change your style. I shouldn't have trusted you. I should have rented a safe. Or a trunk. Something weird about trunks. In old portraits, in the background, there's an open trunk and a woman rummaging in it. Look It's always the same. Behind all the ladies, a servant bending over a trunk. Mysterious... The only mystery is why you are lying. Where's the cash? Did you spend it? Lose it'? Give it away? Why are you hassling me? I'm the painter, it's my money! You may paint, but I sell. Without me, you couldn't sell a single painting! Was I thinking of a man I emulate? EM... M... Matisse! Magritte. Munch. Monory. Milshtein. Manet. Monet. Money! That's it! It must be in there! No way, José! I really don't know. My memory's going... You should've marked the loot. Look at this article, "Magritte's Legacy: A Surrealist Puzzle." The only Belgian joke that's not funny. Yours will be easy. - My what? - Your legacy. I'm not dead yet. A dealer has to look ahead. Dead painters sell better. Bitch! You're tough, but I love you. A girl disguised as a man-eater. You're pathetic, a loser. I'm sick of you. Don't say that, Janou. Don't dump me for $15,000! You're my everything. Give me time. ' Sot it! Cash, wealth, dollars, Dali... Golden Dali! It was Breton's anagram. "Salvador Dali" becomes "Avida Dollars!" My love... I was a good child. I wanted to be like my big brother Andrew. My sister Linda was more girlish. She was pretty. Once they disguised me as a girl to give flowers to the Queen. Prince Philip asked, "Did you grow them yourself?" I didn't know what to say. My childhood was happy. Then, being English, I was sent to boarding school at age 12, far from home. Suddenly I was "99", subjected to teasing in the showers. "Hey 99, still nothing?" The usual. I survived thanks to Jane Welpley, an older girl I adored. She never noticed me. My first walk-on role was in "The Knack". Still, I married the man who wrote the score! I was a nymphet in "Blow-Up". Scandal: I was naked for 20 seconds! A dumb skin scandal. But in England, they never forgave me. They called me "Jane-Blow-Up-Birkin". The good news: I was pregnant with Kate. Luckily, I went to Paris to make a movie. Who do I bump into? Serge Gainsbourg. At first, he thought I wasn't so hot. Then things changed. Our story made all the papers. I posed for pictures, any type of picture. I was happy that Serge was proud of me. I wanted a Jewish baby, Russian, like Serge, with Slavic eyes. And I had her. Charlotte. She was very pretty and very yellow. We called her "Apricot Charlotte". I was like any other mother, except more photographed. I thought it perfectly normal to pose for girlie magazines. I loved being considered pretty. I remember one issue. I was handcuffed to a radiator, naked, in nylons. A Christmas issue! I'm discreet now. I live with someone who detests indiscretion. He wanted a daughter. And we had her. Lou Doillon She looks a lot like him. You told part of your story. Can you let the oat out of the bag? Sure! The small one, too? Find anything out after seeing what's in the bag? Even when you show it all, you reveal very little. But you were revealed by the men you loved. They wrote films for you. And songs. You inspired them. I can see you as a Muse, a Romantic one. I was told Muses never die, but some die of boredom. They pine away, let themselves go, wreck their hair color, bite their nails, and stop singing. Still, these weary Muses know their job. They weep in eternal delight. I'm weeping in anger. I spent years inspiring my poet, helping him work, changing his slightest tear into poetry and song. His fame killed him. At least you're immortal. I'm immortal, but dumped! He had the nerve to die young! If only I could break this, I'd break his neck! I would! Or, if only I could die too. My childhood home is gone. The stairs, the wallpaper are gone. They demolished it. My brother and I play a game now. We enter the hail, wonder how many steps there were to the room on the right. Was the room on the right or the left? The clock was facing us. On the right, the stairs were covered by a red carpet. We played make-believe. Here, on the middle stair. It was hard to detach myself from my childhood home. They say it's a major step when you get your own house. Just like you! Gift-wrapping my house! Thanks for the pink ribbon! Your house isn't a gift? A gift. I paid for it. Nearly. I've paid off 213 of it. The bank's got the other 113. I'm afraid a man in a bowler hat will drop by and say, "Hello, I'm from the bank." He'll move into this 113 of the house look around and say, "Nice place we've got here!" I wanted my home to be like my English home, I wanted my home to be like my English home, warm and cosy. I put fabric on the walls, bought some antiques and lots of knick-knacks. What am I saying? Who cares about old furniture and walls? You don't fall in love with a museum. You love a house for the people in it. I love what a house contains, the people. A house is for living with a man and children... When they're out, I get bored, I don't know what to do with myself. One day they'll all go. On that day, I'll follow the last one out the door. I'll go too. I'll live in a hotel. This is my home. When I get home, I change into clothes that are "me". This is a small living-room. I bought some antiques, I bought some antiques, had the floor re-done to make the room old and cosy. I don't think this living room turned out right. Maybe it's the telephone or the answering machine. I come home, change, then see the red light. 25 messages! Nice messages, but they mean nagging responsibility. The answering machine makes me dislike this room. But there is the good old TV set. Lou watches cartoons. Charlotte and her friends watch the same old videos. Funny... They prefer "Forbidden Games" and "Gone With the Wind". Though I dislike the room, I love the stairs. I love staircases. I filled it with pictures. Everyone's baby pictures. Me, my mother, the children, my babies, other people's babies... It's a 25-page photo album over 3 floors. I've always loved photos. If you think this is another living-room you're wrong. It's the kitchen. My favourite spot. Come in! I wanted a big room. I tore down a wall and put in this big table. The girls work here. Kate used to do homework here. Now she does her fashion lay-outs. Charlotte plays piano. The piano was my first purchase. She plays while I make the meals and Lou scribbles in her books. I like having people around. Do you feel protected by family and friends? People spoil you with flowers. I know I'm very spoiled. But that doesn't mean I'm never lonely. One can be spoiled and lonely. Covered in flowers and lonely. Like a tombstone. I like white flowers. My friends know, so I get a lot of lilies. I leave them in the vase, let them rot until there's a pretty mold on the surface. With other bouquets, I leave the plastic on until they dry out. I keep everything. Why are you staring at me, Gustave? Afraid he's still here to scold you? You should have heard my Gaston, yelling all the time. He'd scare the life out of you! Poor little fellow! What II we have to eat? Veal and mushrooms... Hambone delight... Pété... What's this? A letter from Gaston I never read! "I'm setting down my last request, "my dear wife. "Respect it in memory of my binges with my buddies." Goodness me! Mercy me! I feel funny. He liked to drink. God, how he drank! He'd come home and shout, "Where the hell are ya?" Then he'd beat me up, pass out on the floor and start snoring. But I loved him. I loved him so much. He was my first husband. "Scatter my ashes "on the Montmartre vineyard "where we had so much fun. "Kisses while I'm still alive, Gaston." My Gaston... See? I'm doing just as he said. In memory of his drinking binges and my young girl's dreams. It's funny, anyone who eats these grapes or drinks this wine will eat my husband and drink his... What a thought! I should keep some. Why not? He never said "all my ashes", just "my ashes". You won't leave me, little fellow? If you die, I won't cremate you. I'll stuff you! So you'll never leave me. I don't like caged animals, so I buy them... stuffed. They're not captives that way. On the piano there's a rat, a sewer rat. I'm told they're hard to find, but there's a taxidermist nearby who's very good. I went to his shop to buy a turkey, but I saw a Pekinese I wanted to buy. He said someone was coming in to pick it up. I mentioned my oat and he said, "Bring it in to me right away!" I said, "No, ifs alive!" Poor Mowgli! Then he said, "When its day comes, "bring it in fast or keep it in the fridge! "When you bring it in, "I can set it in its most natural pose." A nice offer, but I don't think I could... I'm not a gourmet cook. I do 2 or 3 nice dishes the children like. I do it for them. For today's meal I'll take "Lancashire Hot Pot" and mix it with a French dish called "Spring Mutton". You need a lot of onions. That smarts! Look at the camera, Jane! God, these onions burn! They say actresses like to cry. I don't know about that. If the role's sad, true to life, then I like to cry. Then I like to cry. "In the park, silent and vast, "Two shadowy figures passed. "Our ancient ecstasy, do you recall? Why should I remember at all? "Does my name set your heart aglow? Am I still in your dreams? "No. "In the park, silent and vast, "Two spectres conjured up their past. "Our ancient ecstasy, do you recall? Why should I remember at all? "Does my name set your heart aglow? Am I still in your dreams? "No... You sleep badly? Often? You suffer from insomnia? Every night? Almost every night. Every other night, like clockwork. As if I were punished for a good night. The sleepless night is like a punishment. I'm used to it. Maybe the good night's sleep is a reward for a bad night. Do you dream? Very much. Good and bad dreams. I haven't had a flying dream in ages. The most wonderful dreams. I fly everywhere, over all of Paris. Once I even landed on my own roof. The best thing about those dreams is when you drift down, you're never hurt. You remember a recent dream? It was horrible. Two policemen came for me. They'd found the body of a woman I'd murdered long ago. It was a horrible murder. She was hanging from the edge of a well. I stomped on her fingers then threw her to her death. Before she died, she scrawled my name in blood on the side of the well. When they found the body, they saw my name. They knew I'd done it. She'd "told" them. When I woke up, I wasn't afraid of the crime, which was horrible, but of everyone reading in the papers that I wasn't nice. Does that matter? Do you care what the papers say? You're asking because we're near a newsstand. Yes, it matters. I want everyone to like me. I want to be nice, natural. I like being loved, popular... Hing on! Christmas is the prettiest time of the year. Ifs nicer than summer, birthdays, the most beautiful time of all. It brings back childhood, the taste of tangerines. Every Christmas is the same. Brandy butter, turkey... the family in England. That's Christmas! When snow blankets a city, you lose your way, your sense of time. You forget, you dream. Cold weather is nice, yet it has drawbacks. The cold brings snow, emptiness, a dream world, silence, and childhood, but cold kills the homeless who have nowhere to keep warm. At any time, in any place, in summer and especially in winter, there are always people less fortunate than ourselves. The underpaid, the exploited, the unhappy, the unlucky, and the unemployed. Patience is a virtue. Whoop-de-doo! The Job Centre says spring'll be great, plenty of work. I just have to wait. The jobless must behave and be patient But the thaw's begun. And soon the sun will warm the rhododendron! Rule A: Patience. Rule B: Courage. The jobless must play the game. Lardy! I've been looking for you. You must be feeling the cold! Come with me! My boss needs help. I told him about you. Built you up! You know I respect you. You don't look pleased to see me! Don't you like me? Is our friendship in the ashcan? Why don't you say anything? You hiding something? BAKERY-GALLERY Fine time to show up, lazybones! - I have a reason, Boss! - More like an excuse! I have a surprise for you. I found an assistant. Another of your buddies! A barefoot layabout! He has shoes! Meet my friend, Lardy. Well, young man! I need a smart right arm. He means, biceps and brains! Here's my arm! Any experience in baking? I'm not kidding! I've work to do... Recite your résumé. Goon. You'd like a run-down of my travels and my talents? I don't have time, there's bread in the oven. Maurel, show him the ropes. Times are hard... So is the boss. He only pays $10 a day, plus 2 buns and a pie! Can you imagine? Here's an advance for not talking to me and for hurting my feelings... Meanie! I've upset the applecart! My applecart! Are those your paintings? You exhibit here? Backwards? Why? I'm discreet. He's shy! Do you sell any? You need better marketing! You don't think I have talent... Yes, I do! Of course! You've never respected me. You're condescending. Hardly! I hate when you condescend! My parents are dense but not my descendants! My kids are smart, smarter than you. You're jealous I have a show in a gallery. Exhibiting beside a bread oven! Are you calling my art crummy? I'm a doubting Thomas. Seeing is believing. You're the cream of the avant-garde! The cream of the avant-garde in your face! Idiot! Meanie! You've no right to waste my dough! You guys are real goof-off artists! I've never seen such nonsense! This is kinda fun! Rule A: Patience. Rule B: Courage. The jobless must play the game. Did you identify with Laurel? Did you like the role? Yes and no. I get so nervous imitating someone, especially Laurel. I felt awkward. The awkwardness made me so anxious, I understood the anxiety in Laurel. My emotion became Laurel's awkwardness. That's what acting is all about. You take everything inside yourself, then transfer it to someone else. Do you think you can play anyone? I think I can dress up as anyone! I hate this! If someone asked me, "Which costume would be your worst nightmare?" I'd say, Spanish dancer! I'm allergic to castanets and Spanish pride. Ifs not me at all! See me? Take a good look, 'cause I'll never do this again! Never again! What I'd like is to make a feature film about howl really am: jeans, old sweaters, messy hair, barefoot in my garden. Just once, I'd like to forget wigs and pretty costumes. I'd like to be filmed as if I were transparent, anonymous, like everyone else. You're the queen of contradiction. You want stardom and its perks. Money, glamour, fame... Yet you want to be filmed like everyday people, who love you for that very reason. You are different, but want to seem nondescript. You dream of being a famous nobody. Once, when I was a teenager, a drowned woman was found in the Seine. She was so beautiful a death mask was made. Copies of the mask were produced. "The Unknown Woman of the Seine" sold well. I bought one. I contemplated her enigmatic smile, as enigmatic as the Mona Lisa's. Had she been happy to kill herself? Or had someone in the morgue forced her mouth into a smile for the mask? No one knew anything about her. So everyone could fantasize about her. She was an extraordinary nobody. An amazing unknown. I wonder if the only true portrait is the death mask. A frontal view of a motionless face. That's all that remains of someone. A motionless face. Like an ID picture, a frontal view, motionless... Silent or speaking, but facing us. I'm Jane B. I was born British. My height is now 5 feet 7 inches. No distinguishing marks. No exceptional talents, but I'm here. You're watching me. And time is passing. Some time has already passed. Your desire to be both known and unknown makes you a public fantasy. Maybe that's what fascinated me. Made me want to make this film. I can transpose you into my dreams, mythological stories, movie memories, idle thoughts. And I can dress you up. What counts most is your partner. Not the costumes. When I played opposite Depardieu, he made me good. Piccoli really held me up, yet I was praised. It was all his doing. He even stuck my lines on his hat. Anyone in particular you'd like to act with? Too expensive! How about a French actor, almost as good, but cheaper? I like actors... directors who act, cult actors... Godard, Jean-Pierre Mocky, Jean-Pierre Léaud... I like Léaud now more than in his French New Wave days, because he somehow has a desperate look. I like that a lot. A lost look. I must only like lost people. All of nature is in one autumn leaf. - Remember the mustard? - No, my love. - Remember me? - I could never forget you. Are you wearing the boots I adore? With the flowered skirt. We can picnic wherever you want, Why here? You said you missed the outdoors. I had a dream about leaves. I was crouched, silent under a pile of leaves, like those on the sidewalk, raked up. No one knew. I hoped someone would find me. I would have saved you. But you'd have to know which pile of leaves I was under. I'd get there, find you without looking, and gently brush away the rubbish hiding the princess. A hero of our times! Chicken? No birds! I was a jailbird! I'm so tactless! Can't be too careful! No more jail for me! Sorry! I had another dream... You may be lovely, but you're no exception. Other people's dreams are boring. I lived in a closet off a courtyard, just inside the carriage entrance. I was soared. I had forgotten to lock the door of my closet. Don't talk about closet dreams! I lived a closet nightmare. A close closet encounter. Case closed! I was closeted away for 4 weeks, close to crazy in the closet, 'cause I thought you'd quit me. You wouldn't wait. But I waited! I wanted you. Now that you're out, I tell you every day, "Calm down and carve the roast." I almost forgot your gift! More chains! Kisses, huggies, cuddlies! And yet you dream about leaves. And closets! I can't help not dreaming about you. No one can. Exactly! If dreams express our subconscious, then I'm not part of you! I'm a daytime fling! Humdrum! I daydream about you, about our future.. I'm in a waking dream. That's not a real dream about me. Maybe I experienced your imprisonment by dreaming of leaves and closets out of sympathy. I don't need sympathy! I want to penetrate your dreams! If I can't, this is only puppy love! Do you dream of me? There are deserts in France and lots of sand quarries. No, you had to come to scorching Africa! You'd never go anywhere. Armchair and TV are more your speed! Armchair travelers never get in trouble. I saw "Sevilla la Torrida". More like corrida. "The Fiery Kiss Over Naples" The fiery kiss you gave that Italian got me a week in the slammer! You tore the bracelet off his arm! Must've hurt, some of his hairs came off! If they only knew what I put up with! Understand, guys? What a beautiful day! It's hard not being able to communicate. You and I have the same problem. With them, ifs worse. Look I'll give them cash. $10! Are you crazy? You throw money away! I don't know! Buy 'em a drink! What's to drink? What do we do? You could give them a belly dance. What would that accomplish? Please... try it. See if they react. Do it for me. Just for you. You're sweet. Raymond! I'm stuck! Hopeless. You're as sexy as a locust to them. I remember once when we were little, we were at the seaside in England. A crumpled newspaper blew over to us across the sand. We opened it. It said, "Marilyn Monroe ls Dead". We said, "No, not her!" She was like a naive muse, inspiring our dreams of being beautiful. We want to move like her. We want to be graceful, pretty, lively, funny. We have one thing in common, one small thing. A song she sang so beautifully called... Marilyn and I are alike in this. I'd love to sing a song for my Daddy. I don't remember all the words. I remember thinking it was funny that at the end of the song, she said something in French. Remember? She sang... "My heart belongs to Daddy" He owns it. She used French words to make the song even sexier. The French have that reputation. Nice going! You always exaggerate! Ifs a celebration of life! You call this life, the desert? It's an adventure. I'm in deep shit! If it's no trouble, put the cape on the sand. Push together. Help push the oar. Get it moving! Fine. Next time my oar breaks down, it won't be here! I don't believe these guys. Let's split! Listen. We'd better stay here. Let's sit down. Good idea. Let's mingle. Quite an adventure, isn't it? It could be our last. True. We'd be safer on a French beach. Howl miss Mom's mussels! Now talk about whats behind the scenes. Backstage! So many years of movies, plays, travels, trips abroad, imaginary travels through painted scenery or real countrysides... Under a sky as false as this or the real sky above us. But the real sky can be threatening. It can threaten me, but this fake one never does. Artists painted it just for me, so it will always be a friendly sky. The crew is behind the scenes. Every move you make, they're behind you, watching. Looking after you. It gives you a warm feeling. When you stumble and fall in the street, no one cares. Here, you're not alone. They watch, waiting for the tear to fall. The dolly grip may be the first person to be moved when you cry on cue, or when you flub your lines. You feel everyone around you coming together to help you make the scene work. Yet behind it all, everything is fake. The real Titian painting is in Italy. We painted a copy here, so I could walk by it. We open a book, ifs an imitation. This is authentic. When you act in a fairy tale it should seem fake, because it's not a true story. But oddly it's not fake. On the contrary. It reminds me of my childhood. Mother would tell me fairy tales. Now I tell them to my daughters. Fairy tales are true, time-tested. Snow White, Beauty and The Beast. They're true. When I go home, my kids ask me what I'm doing. It's hard to say, so I answer, "I'm not sure. "I think I'm in a painting by Agnes." lt's hard to know when you're being... filmed in close-up or in the background, way in the background. How often must I show you how to fold! Always scolding! Quiet, poor fool! Get to work. Why do you harp on my poverty? There's no shame in being poor. But shame is a form of poverty. Ifs all wrinkled. Run the iron over it again. Careful on the lace. What a mess! A plague on the orderly and their orders! The menial class often forgets its place! Make a chambermaid of a beggar girl! She forgets the good earth belongs to our mistress. She forgets the fresh air belongs to our mistress. Of all humans, our Lady must be the least human of all. Yes. She has everything. Privilege, too many dresses, a life of leisure, naked and wanton. She has everything and we have nothing. My love Lies within "Kiss me again "and again a kiss. "Give me again a cause to delight. "Your lover's lips on mine must alight. "Let us unite in fiery bliss. "Troubled, my love? "Your cares I'll dismiss with my kisses so sweet. "Our lips in happiness will meet. "And in our embrace no joy "will retreat." Foolish girl Its forbidden I'll throw you out! I'll tell our Lady! She'll throw you out! The wicked are like flies on open wounds. Put that dress back. Take off those pearls you've defiled! I told you not to spit. Keep your filth inside you, rotting inside you. Evil woman! She thinks her tits are like heaven above! A pox on her! May she grow old, die, and rot in the grave! Beauty is irritating. Flies on a Venus or graffiti on an Eve are like salt in a wound. They burn at the source of the heat. This sort of statuesque perfection leaves me unmoved. I like a man or woman's body. Precisely because of the flaws. I like breasts that are too big, skinny men. Scars move me. I like the idea of time leaving its mark. I like bruises, swollen veins... Perfection bores the hell out of me! And beauty is scandalous! It incites people to scrawl graffiti. But the guy who draws nipples or pubic hair on statues does it to make them more human. What lovely eggs you have! A girl's eyes tell you about her breasts. Her eyes gleam if she has them. If she doesn't have any, her eyes say "Sorry!" When I was 16, I was flat. I was very upset. The long-awaited breasts hadn't come. I had a hang-up, so I bought cotton and foam. I stuffed my bra under my sweater. I thought only breasts could make you appealing. Luckily I met Serge. Not only did he dislike breasts, he was afraid of them. He liked flat girls, girls he'd sketched at art school. I met his standards of a desirable woman. I forgot my hang-up. But my desire to have them hasn't completely disappeared. On the beach, when I see girls with big boobs, I love how they flip-flop. I'll never have that independent bounce. So I have a little regret. Two little regrets. What now? Where do we go? We agreed the film would wander. We'd head somewhere then make a detour. What if we lose our way? I like mazes. I like learning where I've been at the exit. Hope the audience doesn't exit! We need an idea. Like Hansel and Gretel leaving bread crumbs? Or like Ariadne, who gave thread to Theseus, so he'd escape from the labyrinth. I can see you as Ariadne. Shrewd, then in love, then abandoned on the shore. I like those stories. But I imagine the myth differently. Two people in the labyrinth, Ariadne with Theseus or the Minotaur. Anyway, a monster chases her. A monster's chasing you. Can you get out of this maze? Filming bits and pieces? It's like a jigsaw, a piece here, a piece there... A picture appears, with a hole in the middle. Like at banquets. There's a silence, then someone says, "Sing us a song." A song? Gainsbourg! Do you mind the smoke? If I hesitate often Between Me and I If I waver Between I and Me It's 'cause my mind ls on the line I don't kn ow The rules of this game "Cruel and tender game "between Me and I. "We lose sight of each other." "And the game begins again..." Get the breathing right. Good. Closer to the mike. Hit it! In the cold of the night I wonder Where I am You take me I play your game Of love and chance Knowing full well It's a dangerous game Of love and chance My head's spinning Knowing full well It's a dangerous game You cheat at the game So I hide my hand Yet neither Me nor! Can beat you Very nice. It's hard. I'll do better next time! Gimme a kiss. The idea of singing in front of an audience always frightened me. This year was my first time. And it was the first time I ever showed anyone a story I'd written. You showed it to me, I read it. I liked it, so we'll put it in the film. It's strange, almost magical. The first time I dare show anything, it becomes... a part of something, done by someone else. It's nice. I've always written stories, but I don't read much. I like having books around. Being surrounded by knowledge is a warm feeling. But I've jotted things down since I was 12. Now I write in the bathroom. I bought old bookcases and put the panels in the bathroom. Ifs "novel-esque"... Like the stories I dream up. This is the only place I can be alone. The story's about a woman like me, in fact she is me. She falls in love with a very young man. Ifs a love story that ends badly. I tell it as though it were already over. As though it were a memory before it happened. I like melancholy, so I write in the past tense and start with narration. It might begin like this... I remember how I loved him. I remember as if it were here and now. Actually, I've changed. I no longer like vodka, or orange juice, or mirrors in elevators, or Easter eggs. And I couldn't care less what people think or say about us. It was our story. I remember it all, especially him. When I wrote this little tale, this little fragment of a film... I don't have much imagination so I used the people around me. I couldn't imagine it happening anywhere but at home, with me and my kids, just the way we are. Charlotte, who's as tall as I am. Lou, my little moppet. But not Kate, who has her own home now and her own baby. I got the idea from one of Charlotte's parties. ltd been noisy, they'd had a bit to drink. The smallest fellow got sick. I felt for him. Very strongly, in fact. It was like the start of a film. Why don't we shoot it as a family project? ' Set it! With my son playing the boy you fall in love with. Of course. I'll have to talk to Mathieu. You better discuss it with him. He has to puke in the first scene! I drank too much. - Just throw up. - I can't. You don't know the trick? Open your mouth. In another scene I imagined driving into him to add a little action. Watch where you're going! Shit! You OK? I'm fine. They start seeing each other. Then... a scene in a hotel room. Mathieu's only 14! But the hotel room scene is innocent. Innocence in a hotel room! We can go upstairs if you like. Let's go. He was in love with her. Then perhaps she fell in love with him. Mathieu will be able to resist your charms! Really? That's how I see it. Shut up, "Mommy"! Little brat! It's written from my point of view, about the absence of love. About a woman whose life was devoid of love. The spontaneity of this boy changes her life. What about him? I don't know. I don't know any boys. I don't have a son. Why tell me? It bothers me. Now I'm supposed to spill my heart out to you? I don't do that, at least not at home. They're at ease with peers. If Mathieu acts in your story he'll bring his world along, the world of a 15-year-old. His friends, games, slang... At 15, they're already big boys. You're really talking about your childhood. You want your family and England. I'd like to take him back to my childhood. But London would mean filming at my parents'. So I'd be with Daddy and Mummy, who's an actress. I know people think it's corrupting minors, unspeakable. I might just corrupt your script I prefer daydreams to psychology. I like to jump around. Toy with chance, fleeting emotions and events. Your teenage love story isn't for this film. It would take time to tell it right. And time is money. We'd have to finance it, take risks. I'm taking risks right now. My donkey doesn't shit gold every morning! No more bets! We have to find money, take risks. 7 black, odds and manque. Find money... En plein. Take risks... $10,000. For the dealer. Place your bets. No more bets. 32 red, evens and passe. Too bad! How can you lose so much? You can't die of a broken purse. For the dealer. Money and jewels aren't everything. There's more to life. Love of Painting Love of Painting Pay UP! You won't get away with this! We don't have time. Gotta corner her. Find the bag! Thinks she's alone? We're here, Janou. He's not alone. I'll try to talk to him. Hide the bag, at least for now. Why me? Think you'll get away? Forget it! Think you've screwed me? You're wrong Crime doesn't pay! But you will! You'll pay up! You won't get away with this! Not scared of ghosts? You should be! I missed you. Is that so? Ifs true, I missed you. Filthy liar. When I shot you, I knew I loved you. Dead painters, stolen money! Now love, to top it off! Love is life's great mystery! It's a mystery I loved you! Pay up first! The money's mine! Yvan has the bag! Get Yvan! Make him talk! You can't heal a cripple. Where'd you hide the loot'? Careful, Yvan! Don't worry, he'll tell us! Tell them! No more bets! It's all over! It's over! I'll kill you! I'm afraid! Go on! Kill him! My love... My love... It's exciting to die on screen. People applaud dramatic roles. They're easier to play. Crying in movies is fine. But laughing's hard! Laughing on cue is awful! Once in a movie, I had to laugh. So a guy on the crew pulled his pants down. It was dreadful! I'd much rather have to cry in movies. That's odd. People think of you as cheerful and whimsical. You mostly do comedies. But comedies aren't all fun. It's hard work. Lots of retakes, slipping in shit. Once there was this gag I loved. A seagull had to crap in my eye. One of the crew sat on a rock with a putty knife and a big glob of fake bird shit. He kept missing my eye, then he finally got me! It was great! Then I had to look up and say, "Off to a good start!" I enjoyed that. I like things simple. A bit naive. You Tarzan, me Jane. Who's that chick? Yadwiga. What she doing? Dreaming. If I had to do a jungle movie, I wouldn't play Tarzan's Jane. No way. She doesn't appeal to me. I'd like to play Mowgli, the little jungle boy, the Wild child. That's what I'd like. I've never really seen myself as a girl. I see myself in roles of girls disguised as boys. Tomboys, Amazons who remove a breast to shoot better. As brave as men. That's howl imagine it. Like... Calamity Jane, with her shotgun. "Dear Janey, "You're almost 6 years old. "Time has flown by. "I didn't see you grow up. "It nearly killed me to abandon you. "Your foster parents named you Jane, after me, "so I call you Janey. "I took a new trail today. "The men from Bozeman opened it up. "They're on a dangerous mission. "I'd best go along with them "to scare off the Sioux. "I'm the only human being they fear." ls the armour too heavy? It's heavy. But when I went skiing, I was just as loaded down! You wanted to play Joan of Arc. It's a marvelous role. But I could never play it. I'd never be asked because of my English accent. I could never say, "I'll rid France of the English." The audience would burst out laughing! You could be dubbed. Sure, or I could play the final scene, silent... I'd try not to say anything. I won't go! Help me! I'm soared! Help me! Why? Cough again, drop your head and die. So... Its been 10 years. Time passes. I don't know how it passes, but it does. Being 39 was rather fun. Maybe 41 will be too. The even numbers that end in zero... They hurt a bit. Even turning 20 was painful. Anyway, I'll be 40 tomorrow morning. I know what you're up to! Happy birthday, Jane. Best wishes, dear Jane! Love, Agnés Varda Writer, director With kisses from: Subtitling: TITRAWS
