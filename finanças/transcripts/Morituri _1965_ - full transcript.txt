No, it's not a sense of betrayal, Sir. I don't feel that. But I was told I would have command of our next blockade runner. I have seen myself on the bridge, taking the ship... From Japan into Bordeaux. Do you know where I see myself? In Bremen, at home in bed with my wife. Do you have a wife, Kruse? No, Sir. Well, perhaps here in Tokyo it's just as well, hmm? Mr. Kruse, this cargo. God Almighty, how we need this cargo. And Captain Mueller is a man of such experience. Look here. Tomorrow my experience puts me here, on a fine, new Japanese submarine. I'm to show our friends the wolf pack tactics... We used to erase so much allied shipping in the Atlantic. An assignment I do not cherish, you see. I'm grateful for the way you put it, Admiral Wendel. The way I put it is that First Officer or Admiral, we do as ordered. Incidentally, if everything goes according to plan, our paths may cross. Sir, Captain Mueller is here to see you, and he's impatient. It's a bad morning. Nobody's satisfied. Ask Captain Mueller to come in. Admiral Wendel, in the merchant Navy... The Captain chooses his own crew. What are you doing here? I'll be damned if I'll ship with these. Two murderers. Two more, assault with deadly weapons. This one-- "theft of government property." Another, an outright political enemy. It's also a good way to return these bastards to Germany for the punishment they deserve. I'm sorry. I cannot accept them. But there are only a handful, Captain-- I don't want a handful of maggots in my soup! Now, we've given you every reliable man we could find. And must I remind you, Captain Mueller, that you can't afford to protest? Now, Mr. Kruse, will you leave the two of us alone? Stand right there, Mr. Kruse. Admiral Wendel is about to say... That my last ship was torpedoed in the Indian ocean. Well, that's common knowledge. No blame-- that at the time of the attack I had a skinful of rum. Captain Mueller reports that he stood on the bridge for three days... With a festering jaw. It was lanced. Drugs were administered. No avail. Therefore, Captain Mueller tried liquor. It is said to have afforded him some relief. The torpedo didn't know I had been drinking. We cannot interview that torpedo. Be satisfied that the Admiralty retains confidence in you. Believe me, Mueller, take the ship. You'll save yourself a lot of consequences. I can take any of your consequences. I wasn't referring to you. But, you see, at home they are inclined to believe... That certain behavior runs in the family. My son? He's on duty in the north sea area, isn't he? My son is a splendid officer. One of the finest. They wouldn't. Yes, Mueller, they would. They have. The cargo, Mr. Crain, is perhaps the single most important item in the world today. Uh, Colonel Statter, would you like some more tea? No, thank you. The cargo, Mr. Crain, is rubber. Rubber? A ship called the Ingo will leave Tokyo carrying 7,000 tons of raw rubber. Seven thousand tons of rubber, Mr. Crain, will keep the entire German army on wheels... For at least three months. Hmm. Is this music disturbing you? No. Would you like to hear the second movement? No. I'm glad you admire my painting. I bought this Kirschner in, uh, in Zurich. I paid too much for it, but I couldn't resist it. Do you come from Zurich, Mr. Crain? Yes. My family lives there. Mr. Crain, you have no family. You're a German, Herr Schroeder. You've been living in a British dominion here in India... On a forged Swiss passport... For the last three years. You were a reserve officer in an engineer demolition battalion. The day you received orders to report for duty, you turned your back on your country and managed to leave Germany... With most of your funds. I'm not surprised... That you found me. I'm only surprised that it took so long. Oh, but it didn't. We've not had any need for you, until now. What we're astonished at is that you never gave your services to the allies, but buried yourself out here. Buried myself? I think I have here all that I could possibly want. I have my books and my music and a modest art collection... And a visit from a beautiful lady from time to time, and, uh-- what I value most is my privacy. No, let me save you some valuable time, Colonel Statter. I have no intention of blowing up the ship. We don't want you to blow up that ship. It's precisely what we don't want. We want you to save that ship. To-- to save it? Herr Schroeder, as you know, the allies are desperately short of rubber. As much as the Germans want that cargo, we want it more, and we mean to capture it. Yes, well, why do you come to me? German blockade runners... Have orders to scuttle at the approach of an enemy. But if an engineer, a demolitions expert, boards that ship and disarms all the scuttling charges, when the Captain goes to scuttle... He's going to be a very surprised Captain. And also surprised would be the engineer, if he lives to a ripe old age. Oh, obviously there are ways in which this adventure... Might not succeed. Ja, perhaps a thousand, hmm? But if it does, the allied governments are going to be very grateful. And if it fails? The Germans would shoot him. We would have preferred a professional, of course, but there wasn't a qualified man anywhere near Tokyo... To get him there in time. Schroeder, if we capture 7,000 tons of rubber, it's going to save thousands of lives and shorten the war against Hitler. Colonel Statter, aside from the obvious suicidal aspects of your scheme, I personally don't believe that war is ever a solution to political conflict. What do wars ever prove? Men, women and children are slaughtered, and a generation later... Friends are enemies and enemies are friends, and the whole stupid cycle starts over again. Certainly I have great appreciation for your noble effort... And your interest to save thousands of lives, but excuse me if I seem to be concerned for my own life. It's unfortunate you're rated so highly by the Gestapo, Schroeder, because I'm told their penalties for deserters... Are somewhat more theatrical than ours. No, they hold you under house arrest... Until after the war is over, and then they give you a fair trial, as they do in England, I'm sure. You realize you're my prisoner. I can have you transported back to England... And parachute you out of an R.A.F. plane over Germany. And at the same time, a valuable English officer, held by the Germans, will be dropped over England. Exchange of hostages is as old as war itself. Perhaps, uh, blackmail is a little older, hmm? I thought the Holy British empire... Indulged in more modern ethics. Some arrangements are being made... For you to board that ship in Tokyo. But even if I'm put aboard that ship, it still might reach Germany. That's right. Or you may not be able to disarm all the charges and the ship might be scuttled, in which case you're likely to drown, or be rescued by the Germans, or by the allies. In that event, we'll still be able to make use of you. Colonel Statter, you are morally degenerate. In your case, I can't say that I am bothered by any moral nausea. No, I'm afraid the success of the mission is your only hope. Couldn't you have found a more obvious place in Calcutta, like a public comfort station? What did you expect? I'd hoped for something a little more subtle. Perhaps you'd prefer one of our local brothels. That would have at least given me some compensation for the inconvenience. On the return trip, my dear fellow, if you return. Statter, you are a cold bastard. I was born on a chilly island. Here are your personal effects. A picture of your wife and family. Yes, uh, some German money. Your wedding ring. Book matches from your favorite bar in Berlin. More background, further instructions, bits and pieces. Your dachshund. Don't you have some Sauerkraut... And, uh, knockwurst in there for me? Your insignia. Display it at all times. You're a Standard Leader, a top-rank member of the S.S. You're arrogant, rude, brutal, conceited, which should not be difficult for you. Perhaps you would like to hear me sing the Horst Wessel song. No, that won't be necessary. This is a chart used by German merchant ships-- the first 3,000 miles outside Tokyo. We've learned the course of yours. If you place this pin... At latitude 14 degrees north, longitude 175 east, as you see, it makes a circle. Now, depending on winds and currents, your ship will enter this area... 12 to 14 days out of Japan. And within it, waiting for you, will be units of the American Navy. What if, uh, my ship is delayed? Well, that's a fair question. Our friends will be able to wait until the 16th day. So, you see, you have a full 48 hours leeway. How nice. The code name for that area is the Kyle circle, and for this operation you will be known as Kyle. Kyle. How many scuttling charges are there on the ship, and where are they located? That's your riddle. We can't be expected to know everything. The crew believes this to be a routine passage down the China sea. Yes, for a while, Sir, only the Captain, you and I... Are to be aware of our destination. There are some of the reasons. You're whistling, sailor. Yes, Sir. I like to whistle. There's a superstition about whistling on a ship. Heed it. I'm not on a ship yet-- Stay in character, Mr. Kyle. I am sorry, but, uh-- ja. Best to enlighten them at the start, hmm? Correct, Standard Leader. Good-bye and good luck. Heil Hitler. Mr. Kyle. Good luck. Hold your fire. We'll jump ship in Hong Kong. Dr. Ambach, injured man coming aboard. Yes, Sir. When do you leave us? At trench seven. Uh, Mr. Milkereit, after trench seven plot course 76. Seventy-six. Yes, Sir. Right. Captain, I have the honor to present Mr. Hans Kyle... Of the Reich Security Agency, Division 4-e-5, far east zone. I was told a few hours ago there would be such a passenger. You've assigned Mr. Kyle a cabin? Yes, Sir. Hope you'll be comfortable. Check with Dr. Ambach and let me know when that man is ready to report for duty. He wasn't that badly hurt, Sir. Just take care of it. Captain Mueller, I was wondering if you had a few moments-- after we clear the harbor, there'll be plenty of time to get acquainted, Mr. Kyle. Good. I was looking forward to it. Well, I'm not. After all, I know your purpose aboard my ship. Mr. Branner, starboard engine, half speed. Starboard, half speed. It's my belief that political soldiers... Are the lifeblood of a nation, even more than the military. Wonderful observation. - You are a member of the party, Mr. Kruse? - Of course I am. Hmm. Well, Captain, I hope that everything is in order now. It is. Good. I see you're starting your assignment early. Hmm? You're wasting your time. I don't plan to have an infected jaw this trip. Frankly, I'm quite surprised. I thought your department had better use for its men. You don't have to be discreet. Mr. Kruse knows all about it. About what? Well, I can see why the security office felt it wise... To take precautions. Though I am certain that the Captain's drinking and the loss of his last ship... Had no connection. I don't know about this, but I assure you, this is not the reason why I am on the ship, not at all. Which still means you will be looking over my shoulder. I don't know why you, uh, persist in this. It's a long voyage... And I, I hoped that we could find some common interests. Do you-- do you play the chess there? I do. Well, then, we, perhaps, could have a game. Mr. Kyle, I have neither the time nor the desire... To play chess with you. Captain Mueller, uh, I am not accustomed to unfriendliness. And, uh, uh, quite frankly, I was really not prepared for it. Do you have some particular quarrel with the S.S., Captain? I'm sure that you S.S. Gentlemen are very valuable... On dry land. But on this ship I have a job to do. But how does my being on board the ship affect your job? My crew. Word's gotten around that you're aboard, and they're scared to death. This is ridiculous. Ridiculous or not, I shall have to ask you to confine yourself to your cabin, the deck and the salon. I don't want you to interfere with their work or mine. Do you mean, uh-- am I to understand that I will not be free to-- to walk around the ship? Yes, just that. The Admiralty described you as a passenger, so you will have all the privileges and restrictions of a passenger. They failed to describe the Captain as not only foolish but ill-mannered. Well, that's their blunder. Captain Mueller, I don't have to put up with this sort of rudeness, and I would like to suggest that you show a little more respect for me, for my authority... And for the organization that I represent. I am the master of this ship. You are under my authority here. Mr. Kruse, you will attest that the Captain is not only insulting but uncooperative. I will make a full report of this when we reach Bordeaux. Bordeaux? The only report I care about, if we reach Bordeaux, is that Captain Mueller brought the Ingo on a 15,000-mile journey... Through enemy waters... With a precious cargo successfully, even if he didn't play chess on the way. I'd hoped that our relations would be pleasant, but, uh, I see that they won't. Good night. If you will allow me also, Captain, I'm due on the bridge. Mr. Kyle? That was outrageous. Ja, perhaps, hmm? Allow me to apologize for him. No, no. You're very kind, but this is not your concern. But, anyway, I don't intend to comply. Unfortunately, Standard Leader, I must urge you to do as he says. He is in command... Until Bordeaux. Until Bordeaux? Ja. Good night. Good night. Your watch is off at eight bells. All right, Sir. Revolutions: 1,200. Steady. Must have been a rat chewing on a wire. Not much else to eat on this ship anyhow. Hello, Sir! What? I'm looking for my bird. Are you blind? You work in the engine room? I am the Donkeyman, Sir. Hmm? Your name is Donkeyman? No. That is what they call the stoker. Oh. Ja, ja. Oh, I hope my bird isn't disturbing you, Sir. Not at all. You are one of the men who was brought on the ship under guard. Yes, Sir. What is the charge against you? I am a political prisoner, Sir. Political prisoner? Falsely accused? No, Sir. Not falsely accused. Boat drill! Boat drill! To your stations! Everybody to your stations! It's time the men knew the truth. You will address them after the drill, then? I wouldn't make a speech at the Führer's wedding. Address them yourself. Have you seen our passenger? - He's supposed to be at number two. - No. But I'm sure he can take care of himself. Oh, I'm sure he can. But he's supposed to be at his position. Perhaps he's waiting for a personal invitation. Better get to your station, Dr. Ambach. Oh. Ja. Mr. Kyle? Hold the boats! Restore them! Officers and crew, assemble on foredeck! Officers and men, assemble on the foredeck! Where have you been? Attending your boat drill. Are you telling me you've been here all along? Certainly not. There was no life jacket in my cabin, so I was obliged to find one for myself. I managed to locate one in this, uh, this machine shop of yours, which, incidentally, is a filthy hole. That cabin wasn't supposed to be occupied. Well, we're not being torpedoed, are we, Captain? It's just a boat drill, hmm? For security purposes, you have been told... That our destination was the China coast. That is not the fact. This voyage, therefore, will not end in a few days. It will require another 80 days. Journey's end will be a port in France... Occupied gloriously by our countrymen. From now on all watches will be armed. Not the slightest misconduct will be tolerated. Uh, thank you, Mr. Kruse. That's, uh, fine. The watches will not be armed. The first officer mistook one of my orders. As to those of you with bad records, you will toe the line, as we all will. Dismissed. But, Sir-- I have never Captained a prison ship before. I don't intend to now. How is your insane friend today? Fine, Sir. Hmm. Well, this is my first voyage on a freighter. I find it interesting. Very interesting. What is this machine here? The winch. Winch? The winch, for lifting the cargo. Oh, yes. This is the cargo hold, hmm? Yes, Sir. How do you get in? Why, from the deck, Sir, once you get the hatch cover off. You mean there are no connecting doorways down below... From one cargo hold to the other? No, Sir. Not on a freighter, Sir. Better be careful. One day this bird of yours might fly away with a seagull. I promise you, before this ship reaches port... There's going to be one dead S.S. Bastard on it. Come in. Oh. Standard Leader. Come in. I hope I'm not disturbing. Certainly not, Standard Leader. Take a seat. Thank you very much. Care for a cigarette? Uh, ye-- no, no. I think I won't have a cigarette. My coming here is a gamble, but I think I have not made a mistake about you. May I speak, uh, directly? By all means. I think that neither you or I... Are pleased... With, um-- I hope you won't be offended if I ask to see your party card. My party card? Ja. This is my party card. Thank you. Well, I see you have kept up your yearly contributions. Yes. You know, what constantly confounds me... Is the irony of careers in the merchant service. We have a man like Mueller at the top... And, well, a man like yourself, a genuine German, in the best sense of the phrase, is, uh, first officer. But, uh, I did not knock on your door to flatter you. Now, what is your opinion... Of Captain Mueller's approach to discipline? Discipline? Mm-hmm. He approaches it as if we were carrying a cargo of kimonos. Exactly. Now, you must realize by now that I'm not just a passenger. Certainly. And I am not here to count the bottles of wine that Mueller drinks. It is necessary for me to inspect this ship--- all of it-- and I prefer that Captain Mueller is not made aware of this, or anyone else. Yes? And you will be kind enough to arrange this for me. Now I must ask to look at your party card, Standard Leader. Please drop the title when we are alone. It's-- may I see it? Ja. You know, I'm-- I'm happy that you asked me this... Because if you didn't I would know that you were not being as alert... As you might be. May I ask... The purpose of your request? I am sorry, but under the circumstances... I cannot afford to take anyone into my confidence. But, uh-- thank you. I can tell you this, which is something that you're already aware of, and that is that there are political prisoners on board. Hmm? And if I were a political prisoner, uh, I would not be completely disappointed... If this ship did not reach Bordeaux. I feel I should oblige you, Mr. Kyle, but to act contrary to the orders of my superior-- ja, certainly I understand, but if you should feel the need for my support at any time-- I appreciate that very much, but... I must think it over. Naturally. This is, uh-- this is logical. But while you think it over, I would like to remind you of our first allegiance. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Thank you so much. Good night. Good night. Mr. Kyle! Mr. Kyle! I'm sorry to interrupt you, Sir, but this is impossible for me. I'm not prepared for a lengthy voyage. Would you use your influence, Sir? I-- I don't believe I understand. Well, I have to be returned to Tokyo. We must put about. You have a rather original sense of comedy, Dr. Ambach. I know I sound absurd, and I'm sorry to bother you, but I have problems-- certain problems. Dr. Ambach, we all have problems. Hmm? But, Mr. Kyle, these are extremely serious problems. So, in this case... I suggest that you swim back, because it only takes three weeks... And the water is not cold this time of year. This is Radio Norddeich in the heart of the fatherland... Bringing music and personal messages... To our gallant fighters far away on lonely seas. Touching, isn't it? Get used to it, Branner. It'll follow us all the way. Good to be back with you after all these years, doc. Look at him. Ten pounds of trousers for two pounds of rump. You weren't so funny back in Cape Town, were you, when you came crying to me with a very far-gone venereal disease, which I found almost impossible to cure? We interrupt this broadcast... To bring you a bulletin of special interest. United States aircraft today attempted their first raid on German territory. No damage was sustained. Our fighter planes shot down 11 of the enemy bombers. Eleven? I knew it. That'll show them, huh? Of course, what are 11 planes to the Americans? They claim they are going to build 50,000 in a year. Milkereit was always a pessimist. Senior grade-- "if Adolf Hitler is steering towards war, he is a lunatic." Letter to a lady friend, 1935. The lady liked to save letters, and the Gestapo likes to collect all kinds of odd documents. I have that report in your service file, Milkereit. But I was much younger. I don't feel that way any longer. Just make sure that your change of heart is permanent, Milkereit. And in the future make sure to take up with less sentimental ladies. I once knew a girl who sang that song. A girl back home. Home. It's been almost two years. Sir! A message from Tokyo. Turn that damn radio off. "Enemy ships reported, your vicinity. Camouflage your vessel as British freighter immediately." I'm coming up. Hold it steady. Raise the starboard waist! Get going. Kruse. Come with me. It's urgent. What's urgent? This is an emergency. Come. Cornelsen, take over for me here. Yes, Sir. Kruse, I've decided to take you completely into my confidence. Sabotage. Very clever work. Now I think you know why I am on the ship. My instructions were to handle this by myself, but now there is no time. There are 12 of these scuttling charges? Yes. That's efficient. Two or three could probably sink the ship, so we will have to cover them all. Now, uh, how many are there... In, uh, in this hold? Two. Where are they located? One's over there, at the end of this opening. Run a cable from the aft mast... To this deck. Yes, Captain. The last one's down here. What's in the barrels here? The barrels? Lard. Lard? Yeah. A few hundred tons. From Okinawa. For making margarine and candles. We even have a small shipment of oolong tea. Thank you. Uh, tell me, Kruse, where is the master switch for these charges located? In the wheelhouse. In the wheelhouse? Ja. Then I'm sure the Captain has the only key, hmm? Of course. I think this one has not been tampered with. It's all right. Twelve charges, and the only two damaged are in the engine room-- the Donkeyman. I'll make short work of him. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoever is it, we watch them play out their hand, hmm? But the Captain ought to be notified. Certainly not. Under these circumstances, everyone is suspect. Even you. Look here-- Very fortunate circumstances... To find an alone American ship. Very. We have made radio contact with the Ingo again, Admiral. She's on course, and all is well. Where was your ship going? Australia. What is your occupation? I am a surgical aid. Why were you going to Australia? I was a member of a medical team. You were born in Berlin. Yes. And your parents-- also born in Germany? Yes. So... a German girl on an enemy vessel. Whatever gave you the absurd idea I was German? If you're not a German, what then? I am anti-German. Captain, luck's still with us. The fog is coming in a lot thicker. You know the chantey of blockade runners out of Tokyo, Bo'sun? "Nine days out, all will be fair. Ten days out, sailor beware." Yes, Sir. Captain, the steward has just made a strudel. Good. I'd love it with a cup of coffee. I've had the men go over the engines again. Cylinder head pressure's normal, revs increasing. You must be getting very bored, Mr. Kyle. I'm sorry we don't have shuffleboard or a band. Well, I've been able to occupy myself, Captain. I've been studying the animal life in my bunk, and the wind and waves and-- well, the wind and the waves have been very good to us. They certainly have. We're nearly a full day ahead of schedule. Yeah, and the old tub is still glued together. So help me, I'm beginning to get fond of her. Sir! A number of ships, two different codes. Very strong. Signals are much stronger, Sir. They might be a city block away in this porridge. Kruse. Captain? Shadow! There! Pinned her too, Captain. Englishmen. Improved "d" class of Lambert and Holt. Englishmen. Like ourselves. Three ships off port bow! Convoy! Convoy. And we're in the middle of it. What do we do now, Sir? Mr. Kruse, 20 degrees to starboard. Keep parallel to the convoy. Yes, Sir. Twenty degrees to starboard. We bluff, young man, and we believe in miracles. Captain! Captain, there's a destroyer... Heading straight for us-- an American, Benson class. Four guns, 10 torpedo tubes. Makes 36 knots. Good. Send them a citation. Captain, it's a matter of minutes. Mr. Kruse, sound the general alarm. Don't sound the horn. It may be a routine sub patrol and bear off. All men to stations except radio, engine room and bridge. Sir, radio message received. Destroyer wants identification. Tell Mr. Nissen to send: "British Stonehenge in convoy." And send it slowly and garbled. Garbled, Sir? Mr. Nissen knows the meaning of the word. Now move! Yes, Sir. Somebody bring me a cigar! General alarm! General alarm! Don't use the horn! They are bound to see we are a fake pretty soon. We'll be sent to a prisoners war camp, maybe in Hawaii, in the sun! Come on, darling, take us! Come take us, darling! Come on! Donkeyman, what are you waiting for? Let's go! First I've got a piece of business to take care of. Eight hundred yards. Seven hundred. Six hundred. Five hundred yards. Three hundred fifty. He is changing course. He's bearing off! We are getting away with it. They think we are real. I don't know what they think, but it's time somebody lit my cigar. You there! Hoffman! Get up the stack and kill the whistle! Captain, the destroyer has ordered us to stop immediately for boarding. Here, Sir. Mr. Kruse, halt engines. Halt engines, Sir. Halt engines! Halt engines. Engines halting! Abandon ship. Abandon ship. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Heave to the boats! Are we scuttling, Sir? - Get on. - I'll take care of it. Get in the boats, men! Let's hurry up! Hurry up! Hoist the line! Captain Mueller! Wait! Why aren't you in the lifeboat? Don't throw your life away needlessly. You're insane. I'll be over the side as soon as I finish this. Mr. Kruse! Hold the lifeboats! Everybody back to stations! Sir! Sir! Mr. Branner reports engine room ready. Full ahead. Give me everything you can deliver. Hard to starboard. Hard to starboard. We'll make for that fog bank. Maybe we can sneak out of here. Helmsman, what's your reading? One-one-zero, Sir. Port two points. Port two points, Sir. Mr. Milkereit. Mr. Kruse. Sir? Radical change of course. Which alternative, Sir? - Put us on course beta. - Yes, Sir. Mr. Cornelsen. Yes, Sir. They'll send our description to every skip between here and midway. Call Bo'sun to my quarters. We'll change camouflage again. Yes, Sir. Mr. Kyle. Yes? I have misjudged you, Mr. Kyle. I never for one moment thought that... You might try to save my life. You gentlemen of the S.S. Don't usually display... The humanity of a sand crab. Well, to be honest with you, I couldn't help myself. Well, gentlemen, was it god or the Führer that brought the fog? Thank both-- and the Captain as well. Oh, ja. I must say, he used his wits. Ja. He was brilliant. Ja. Milkereit, in which direction are we headed? Sorry. Our course is classified. Don't you think that, perhaps, by now.. I'm an exception to the general rules? As navigation officer, I can't allow-- just for once, use a little common sense. It's your responsibility, Sir. Mr. Kyle. This is our present position. This was the old course, almost due east. Now this will be our new course. See? Ja. Is that coffee over there? Ja. Could I have a cup, please? Thank you. Of course. Do you take sugar? One teaspoonful. Here's the coffee. Oh, thank you very kindly. Ja. Now, this is the new course. New course, ja. Well, we lose a lot of time this way. Oh, ja. Several days. You must have dropped your pin. No, no. I never can measure distance on a map. I was trying to find out how far it is from here to here. Oh, that's very easy. Just a moment. From here to here. That's 220 miles. Hmm. Ja, it's strange. It's only about two inches, and yet it's further than Leipzig to Dusseldorf? You're right. Uh, this island, it's not dangerous to go so close? Oh, no. It's uninhabited. It's of no tactical value for us or the Americans. Ja. It has such a strange shape. It's like a Starfish. What are you laughing at? Well, that's its name. "Starfish island." Starfish. Ja. Ridiculous. Well, this is certainly interesting. I've never seen it before. Kruse, would you, uh, excuse me, please? I'll see you a bit later. Thank you. Sure. Sure. Standard Leader. Standard Leader. All right. Shall we go to my room? Mine's right here. The swindle is over. What swindle? It's damn plain that you don't want this ship... To reach Bordeaux. - What do you want of me? - We want to hear what you've got to offer. And if we don't like it, we turn this over to Kruse or the Captain. Milkereit, how many are there of you? Well, we have four others. Four? And there are no officers? No. How long have you been together with these men? We started to talk during the camouflage. I saw you jam the whistle and realized you were also in the fight against Hitler. I see I am surrounded by patriots, hmm? Not these others. If they reach Germany they will be finished. Ja. I think you will be finished also. Yes, I know. I keep wondering if that's why I was assigned to you on the ship. We have the same goal: To keep our heads on our shoulders. Every time we bump into each other... It's near a scuttling charge. Am I right? Ja. I was trying to disarm them. What's your plan? Now there is no plan. Before we changed course, we were headed straight for an allied ambush. An ambush? Ja. There were American warships waiting for us. But now it's finished. What is your plan? We haven't any plans. Well, there's only one chance, then. This island, star-something-- Starfish island? Starfish island. How far is it? About 3,000 miles. How many days? Roughly 15 days. 15. How close do we come to it when we pass? About 70 or 80 miles. Mr. Milkereit. Mr. Milkereit. Just a second, Sir. Excuse me, Sir. I was just lying down. That's all right. Milkereit, I need a report of all the winds and currents of the new course, beta. As soon as possible. Yes, I will do it. Okay. Yes. Would it be possible, When we pass this island, to take one of these rubber boats... And put it over the side? If it's night. And nobody sees us. The chances of making the island would still be 15-to-1. We must take whatever chance we have. Now, there are three scuttling charges that I have not yet disarmed. I will continue to disarm the charges... In the event that we are intercepted by an allied warship. Now, are we all agreed? Yes, we do. Stop engines. Slow astern. Stop engines. Slow astern, Sir. Lower the gangplank. Lower the gangplank, Sir. Lower the gangplank! All you men here, lower the gangway. Hurry up! Get it over with! "We'll continue to observe radio silence... Until after transfer of prisoners." What transfer of prisoners? Shall I send a reply, Sir? Yes, tell them Captain Mueller just jumped overboard. Did you disarm it? Ja. There are only two left. Welcome aboard the steamship Christina. Thank you, Captain. It's always nice to meet an honest Swedish skipper. You must enjoy being a neutral. You're lit up like a Christmas tree. I'm glad I'm no longer English. You came within 100 yards of putting a torpedo in my belly. Your destroyer almost put a depth charge down my throat. Back to stations. Back to stations, Sir. Back to stations, everybody! Well, I-- I can certainly see why you were so obstinate back in Japan. I now hand you custody of 15 prisoners. Interrogation report on each, as well as one on the girl. Nothing is spared me. You will find that one very interesting. Mr. Kruse. Captain? Escort the prisoners to 'tween decks number five. Yes, Sir. Move! Just a minute! Mr. Cornelsen. I certainly wouldn't put her up with them. Mr. Cornelsen, take her to my cabin for the time being. Now, Admiral Wendel-- I know. I know this new cargo is a burden, Captain. That's why you radioed the request, not the reason, for this rendezvous. Were you afraid I might get a bit too obstinate this time? We thought of that, Mueller. We thought of that. Now that you are here, would you join me for a drink? Fine. I wouldn't have missed this chance to congratulate you. Slipping in and out of that convoy-- remarkable seamanship. Thank you. Very gratifying for a Captain who has to have a keeper on his tail. - Keeper? - You insist on playing games? Very well. The passenger you gentlemen put aboard. Someone we put aboard? Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Admiral Wendel, Commander Busch, this is my passenger, Mr. Hans Kyle of the security office. Admiral Wendel, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm delighted, Mr. Kyle, to meet you here. Thank you. Glad to meet you. Your department didn't notify me of your assignment. Oh, that's strange. I presented my credentials to the embassy. Naturally. Then your venture was authorized after I left Tokyo. Ja, perhaps so. Well, anyway, this is not a venture. I'm just here as a passenger. Please sit down. Thank you. Where were you before Tokyo? I'm not able to reveal this. Secret information, no doubt? Classified. Gentlemen. I'll wager one thing-- when you left port, you didn't expect... To run into two officers from the German Admiralty. Never hoped for such luck. As my friend Bernard Webber used to say, if you can imagine a situation, it is-- you knew Brigade Leader Webber. - Webber? - From S.S. Leadership school. You went there, of course? Oh, ja, sure. Class of 1938. General Ordenlicher was the commandant then. Are you acquainted with him? - Uh, yes, uh-- - he was a wonderful man. Class of '38. Well, then, you must know Brigade Leader Webber. The chief of political evaluations. Uh, Webber, Webber. Ja. I remember him. I see you smoke an English briar. An amazing observation. You should be in counterintelligence. I am. Really? And, frankly, what we would like to determine is... What you are doing on board this ship. Well, nothing more important than, uh... Being a passenger. But I'm so flattered with your interest. Well, I never did finish my remark about Brigade Leader Webber. - The political evaluation chief. - Right. And the astonishing fact is that he doesn't exist. I invented the man. Of course he doesn't exist. Gentlemen, I don't wish to embarrass you, but, really, this kind of interrogation technique... Is childish, hmm? We learned this in the first two weeks of leadership school. But I am fascinated by your curiosity. You would be less fascinated... If I told you that, perhaps, you, too, are an invention, Standard Leader Kyle. Now, gentlemen, if it wasn't for Mr. Kyle, we wouldn't be aboard this ship. He stopped me from scuttling her. I had my hand on the switch. Mr. Kyle thought I was going to stay with her and did his best to stop me. And while he was doing that, your wolf pack blasted the convoy. So, you see, if he hadn't delayed me for a few seconds... 7,000 tons of precious rubber would have been at the bottom of the sea. So Mr. Kyle is capable of a sentimental gesture. That doesn't clear up my doubts. I see no reasons to discuss matters... That concern only my department. And now, Admiral Wendel, let me notify you in very simple terms, the security office will be informed in exact detail as to your interference. Is that clear? Mr. Kyle, I will not permit-- gentlemen. There's no real problem. All you have to do is radio Berlin. Ja. Excellent idea. This is, uh, logical, hmm? Captain Mueller, are you willing to be answerable... For Mr. Kyle? Yes. I'll accept that. I don't think we need trouble Berlin. I realize that we have offended you, but you must understand our need for caution. If I didn't, who would? At any rate, my regrets. Admiral Wendel. And thank you for your excellent hospitality. Good night, Mr. Kyle. Naturally, I'll radio Berlin. By this time tomorrow, you should have a complete report. Meantime, keep an eye on him. Captain Mueller, thank you for your gesture. It was very kind. You gentlemen wouldn't trust your own embalmer. Enjoy your next 24 hours. They may be your last. They're checking with Berlin. Did the officer who brought you here ask your name? No. Good. You must promise to keep your mouth shut. Keep my mouth shut about what? - About the fact that you're-- - a jewess? Is it so difficult to say the word? I have nothing against you because you are Jewish. One can't choose one's parents. Is that what you mean? No, that is not what I mean. Sit down. Sit down! That's my son. He'd like you. On the other hand, he might prefer to lop off my head. Why do you resent being treated with respect? Let's see. Your name: Esther Levy. Levy won't do. What shall we call you? Cohen? Shapiro? Look, there's a long trip ahead. Put a lid on your pride. It's worth it to make yourself comfortable. And let you feel decent. If you wish. Well, then lend me a needle and thread. I'd like to make this outfit... More attractive for the concentration camp. When we reach Bordeaux, this report will be lost. And with luck, perhaps you may find the way to lose yourself there too. I'm sorry. It's the most I can do. Do you want to sleep with me? Or are you just doing this because you're kindhearted? Young lady, even this kind of impudence... Will not stop me from treating you... Simply as another member of the human race. All right. In America, I lived with a family named Goddard. Milkereit, since you are on the bridge... You can take the Captain by surprise. Alone? Boeck will be with you. Uh, Donkeyman, you and Hoffman will overpower the guards on the rear deck. How will we get those prisoners with us? I will have to find a way... To speak with them as soon as possible. I would, first, like to consider all the risks-- there is nothing to consider! Consider how your face will look with a piano wire around your neck... When Kruse sends his report to the Gestapo. - But without those prisoners we have no chance. - Not even with them. If we take over the ship, we are only two days away from the American Navy. You know what looks very good to me now? Starfish island. Donkeyman, you said the odds against this island... Were, what, 15-to-1? What are they against this plan? 14-to-1. Well, we must make a decision. Yes. Well, let's go. Uh, Miss Goddard, this is Standard Leader Kyle. How do you do? Miss Goddard is an American girl. She studied in Germany. Oh? We are delighted to have you with us. Is it, uh-- is it my insignia that disturbs her, hmm? Captain, where is my room? Right here. Well, it's obvious you share the Captain's sentiments about the S.S. As I told Captain Mueller, it was a long voyage. Yes, chess partners are very difficult to come by, Mr. Kyle. Uh, evidently. All right. Miss Goddard. Miss Goddard? Who is it? It's, uh, Mr. Kyle. Could I speak with you a moment? There is a crack under the door. It should be easy for you to crawl through it. At 7:00 every morning, an officer and two crew members... Will supervise the prisoners' exercise. After this, the weapons will be locked in the ordnance room. Now, I understand the hatch covers... Over the prisoners' hold were closed last night. You must like steam baths. From now on, the hatch covers will remain partially open... And, therefore, the regular watch will be armed. I acted for our well-being, Sir-- not for the enemy's. Well, I won't let it spoil my appetite for breakfast. I'm glad of that, Sir. Stop. There's international rules. We've got a right to be heard. Shall we arrange it for them? I would like to be there when you try to convince these birds... To join the Gestapo. Someday it will be a pleasure to pay a visit to America, huh? This will be wonderful. Meanwhile, let's eat. Thank you. Keep moving. Let's go! Keep moving! You, call Dr. Ambach. Take them forward to the hospital right away. You, follow them. Captain, emergency! A prisoner's hurt. We can't rouse Dr. Ambach. Get me the morphine. It's bad, but not as bad as the racket you're making. What's the matter? There's no morphine here. I'll get it. You can be of use. Go up there and help. You up here, us sweating in a dungeon. Your kind always wind up living rich. Oh, shut up. Shut up, you crackpot. We're sick of hearing that garbage. What's this? What do you mean? He means I'm a Jew. Where do you hide the ship's morphine? This damned fever gets me-- where is the morphine, Mr. Ambach? Morphine? There is no morphine. No. No. No. It's mine. It's mine. I brought it aboard the ship myself. It's mine. It's what's mine. It's private property. No, you can't have it. You can't, Captain. I'll die without this! I'll die! You'll live, Mr. Ambach. They told me, "voyage to China coast. Only a few days." They lied to me. I had to take it. I had to take it. I had to. Do you want me to clean it now? When a Jewish bitch takes over the sick ward, then-- Miss Levy is perfectly able to attend to this. "Miss Levy"? You knew. Have you thought of the effect on the officers and men? I didn't know it was contagious. Now, what do you have to say about this? I think you are out of your mind, but, after all, you are the master of the ship. That I am. Take care of it. You can do it better than I can. Are you saying she'll continue to have a stateroom? You'll go on feeding her in the salon? The lady's privileges will remain. The steward will serve your meals in your cabin if it's too much for you. I must remind you of the consequences. I recognize that word. If all Germans had conducted themselves like this, where do you suppose we'd be today? Certainly not where we are now. You are speaking to a party member. This is not a party office. Remember, there's nothing chalked up against me. Don't you-- not even an ounce of Jamaican rum. Listen, I've been at sea too long for this. I know all your talk. I'll take the responsibility for what I do. You young men... Who keep the world breathless. It's your time, I know. But to realize your dreams... You'll need something more than brutality. You'll need, if you can manage it, a little mercy. What could you know of our dreams? I'm all right now. Thanks. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. Now, listen. Just listen and be quiet. If you scream, you will only place your life in danger. Now, understand that I am not an S.S. Man, I am a German working for British intelligence. I'm planning to take over the ship. I'm going to take my hand away from your mouth. I don't want you to scream. Don't scream. I am not an S.S. Man. I am working for British intelligence. I'm planning to take over this ship. I don't believe you. You have no choice. You are a Jew on your way to Germany, and if you value your life, you will need my help and I will need yours. How can I be of help to you? Well, I cannot take over this ship without the American prisoners, and I may need your help to contact them. Why don't you contact them yourself? I am going to try, but the message exposing me is on its way from Berlin. If it comes by 8:00 tonight when the watch changes, then you will have to persuade them. They will not believe any of the men with me. If our plan succeeds, we will be finished with this idiotic war. You think this war is idiotic? All wars are idiotic. One is not different from the other. Then why are you here? Certainly not by choice. I was blackmailed by a Britisher... To the strains of Mozart. I am not concerned about this war. I don't care who wins or loses. But I am concerned about the Gestapo. You have no idea what these people are capable of. Oh. Like, uh... Like maybe force me to have sex with my brother, or something like that? And maybe kill Bernard... If he's not able to have sex with me, and then maybe make me sleep with all of them. All 17 of them. Hour after hour, after hour, after hour, after hour, after hour, after hour! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Be still. Well, while you were listening to your Mozart... My mother and my father were... Marched to the gas chamber where they were killed. You want to tell me about the Gestapo? Get out! Get out! Get out! Be quiet! Silence! Hallo, midshipman Emil Brinkmann. Your father, General Franz Brinkmann, awarded Knight's Cross with Swords. Engineer Mark Leicht, we hope you're listening. Your brother, major Martin Leicht, awarded the Knight's Cross... After a daring bombing mission on the Russian front. Hallo, Captain Rolf Mueller, on duty in the far east. Your son, Lieutenant Karl Mueller, commanding motor torpedo boat off the French coast, having sunk his fifth ship in the last three months, the latest, a solo daylight attack, which sank the British vessel Carapace, awarded the Knight's Cross. Wonderful! Congratulations, Sir! This is a great moment! Sir, everyone in your command feels honored. That's very kind. Thank you. The Carapace. Let's see what's her tonnage. It must be in the Talbot. Congratulations, Captain. It must be a proud moment. Thank you, Mr. Kyle. Congratulations, Captain! Congratulations! Wonderful! Carapace on page 131, Sir. To your health, Sir! And to your son's! To your health, Sir. He must be quite a seaman. Heil Hitler! Heil! Heil! Heil! Hail the Knight's Cross. He's gone crazy drunk. - Heil! - Half the ship can hear you. Can they? Tell me about the consequences. Tell me the consequences. Huh? Read me the sentence. What is the worst? To fight war alongside you? Milkereit, you poor fool. Raised your voice against them. You don't know about the consequences. Wouldn't it be wonderful... If it turned out you're not an S.S. Man at all? Ah, they'll turn you into one of them, into a cannibal. The most wonderful, gentle boy-- Heil cannibals! Heil! Heil! Back to stations, everybody! Come with me. Tell all the officers to assemble in the salon at once. Yes, Sir. The point we spoke about, it's here. And I need you as a witness. Now go on. Things are falling apart. Kyle can't do it. I will. Sure, he's on a spree, but he'll work it off. I've made this entry in the ship's diary: "Captain Mueller is mentally and physically irresponsible... Due to alcoholic overindulgence." Dr. Ambach will confirm this. I wouldn't take cokehead's diagnosis of a cockroach. Mr. Branner, Mueller's illness is chronic. He was drunk when his last ship was torpedoed. It's hard to believe. Mr. Kyle? Ja. It's unfortunate, but, uh, he is correct. And under these circumstances I think we must follow Mr. Kruse. For the protection of the ship, I'm now taking command. Inform your men. Dismissed! Captain Kruse. Captain. It's for my health. Mueller didn't understand this. I can't live without it. I'll see you get what you need. But it won't be morphine. This one here was caught trying to sneak into the prisoners' hatch. Really? Well, perhaps, that's where she prefers to be. Take her down in the hole with the others. Go ahead. I don't mean to interfere, but this is disgusting. Thank you very much for your help, Mr. Kyle. Ja. Steward. Yes, Sir? Oh! I have been told that you are now-- correct. Here. Sew the fourth stripe on the sleeve. It's regulations. Yes, Sir! If this works out, I want a front row seat... When we nail Kruse to the mast. Are the men ready? Yes, they will be. But suppose the girl can't persuade those prisoners. Then I will have to try to get down there... And persuade them myself. All right, but that will be a while. Suppose we believe this guy Kyle. What's his plan? You start a fire down here, then you scream your lungs out. You climb up the ladder and you yell, run, scatter. Are you kidding, lady? They'll be waiting to shoot us full of holes. No, the fire will confuse the guards... And Kyle's men will overcome them. You can't win a battle just by yelling. You need guns. You'll get guns. Where they gonna get guns? One of the officers is with us. He'll attack the Captain and take the keys to the ordnance room. The stunt's cockeyed. Let 'em try it alone. Shh! They're outnumbered. It's nine against 40. So? So we join them, huh? And then it's only 2-to-1 against us. That's enough! Let's suppose we make this Kyle circle. We get a cup of coffee and a ticket to the Golden Gate. Then what? Then we get good and drunk. Sleep for a month in a bathtub of beer. We'll see if the girls are still at shanty's bar. - That's for me! - I say "aye." Don't be such a hero. You'll get a kiss and two weeks shore leave. After that, you'll be back on the front lines again. Swimming in burning oil and boiling like a mackerel. I say let's vote on it. And I'm for it! I'm with you. Good man! I'll go along. All right. Ten, huh? Against five. Majority rules. - The hell it does! This ain't the congress. - Shh! Then we'll try it without you. The hell you will. You blow this, they'll kill us all. That's not true. You think the bastards will string you up and serve us ice cream because we laid off? Start a fire here and they'll be damned sure every one of us is in on it. He's right. Look, I'm sorry. We'd take the chance, you see, but, uh, it'd have to be all of us. I'd rather take my chances in a prison camp. I'd like to take mine right here. You and me both. Don't look so worried, baby. We're all nice guys. Sure. You kept too much to yourself on the old blue dolphin. If you'd spent a little time with us, you might've had some fun. And, baby, we've got nothin' but time from now on. Are you kiddin'? Get your hands off her! There's one thing you're good for. Stop it! Break it up! You can have it if you want it. And you, or you. Join the others. Make them keep their word. Make them keep it. - Mr. Kruse! - Ja. Sir, radio message from Admiral Wendel. Wendel? Thank you. I'll handle this so-called Mr. Kyle. Milkereit! Milkereit! Now you will kindly tell me what this is all about. I can start the new one now. You see? It's very nice. Yes. Branner. Fire! Fire! Wait! Come with me. Lutz, you cover them. Donkeyman, the ordnance room. Surrender! All right. All right. We give up here. Don't shoot. We are finished. Come up! Up! Get in line! All right. Let's find the other two. Branner. Mr. Branner! Take the engine room. Cornelsen, the foredeck. There is a rubber boat, midships. We can heave it over the side and jump off then. We'll disappear in two minutes. Come on. We can make it. Why not? Now I'll blow up the ship. Do it. Anybody seen my bird? I can't find him. My baby hates the sound of guns. It scares the feathers off him. Where's Kyle? Where's Kyle? Kyle? Where's Kyle? Where's Kyle? He's hiding in the propeller shaft. Move. Take the prisoners below. Yes, Sir. Search the lifeboats! Captain Mueller. So, Admiral Wendel was right. Ja, but there's no time for this. Why not? Your mutiny has failed. Not yet. You once said that-- that the worst consequence would be to have to fight alongside men like Kruse. There is another way. There's a rendezvous point where American warships are waiting for us-- at 14 degrees north, 175 degrees east. You have a choice. Whatever else I am, I'm not a traitor. Neither was your son. Get out. Get out. Ja. I will. There! At the bridge! Out! Get out! Move! No, no, no! Mr. Kyle, please, no! The engine room is torn to pieces. She's flooding. Abandon ship. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Hurry up! Hurry up! Help. Save me. Here. Here. Over here. But, Sir, please. I am where I belong. I intend to stay here. Now, over the side, all of you! Captain-- do as I say. Mr. Kruse, over here! Over here! Here! Come on, Mr. Kruse. Over here! Captain Mueller. Mr. Kyle! You won't need that raft for a while. What-- what is it? What's happened? Well, the lard, it's solidified-- plugged up the holes. How much longer will we remain afloat? Well, it's lasted two hours. Maybe another two. Maybe ten-- unless we break up first. Ten hours. In what direction are we drifting? We couldn't drift that far in days. It would take a warship going full ahead a good six, seven hours. Captain Mueller. I don't suppose you would consider sending a radio message for me, hmm? You're not very subtle, Mr. Kyle, but I must admire your courage. You're the one with courage, Mueller. It takes real courage... To see your son turned into a merciless fanatic... And... Still believe in your mildewed concepts... Of the fatherland. I envy you. I wish I had so much to believe in. If you have nothing to believe in, why did you blow up the ship? That doesn't matter now, hmm? ***Subtitles By gnl***
