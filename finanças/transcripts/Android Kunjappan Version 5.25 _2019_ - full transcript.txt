Coffee, Please â™ªâ™ª Coffee â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª Huh... What... Why don't you kill me then? Dip the holy twig in the water Wear it on your ring finger On the ring-finger I wear my ring on this finger Alright... Take some rice, soak it, and place it there Take the scutch grass twig, soak it, and place it there as well Started a while back? - No, just now Take some water, invoking the seven holy rivers... Which are..? - Hm ? Ganga, Cauvery... hmm... River Nile? Just place it here Mix the rice with the curd, and make fourteen balls Invoking your father in your prayers, place them one by one along with the other offerings But Madhavan, why fourteen times? Kunjappan used to eat a lot, fourteen might not be sufficient I don't know, thatâ€™s why I am asking - I think it should be 16 But... Isn't that how it should be? Isn't today the 14th day after his death? Death? Did you see him die? Then you tell me, how many days has it been? - Ah! Then you can put the blame on meâ€¦ Do whatever! Volley it long... long ball, or else they'll score - Pass it here! Pass it along! - Come On!! Just missed! Chuppa! Throw the ball back in Prasannan, are you done here? Just a moment, we are about to lose Come on boys, back to positions Whatâ€™s up, Madhu? You've been here a while now. Lot of leaves, huh? I quit the job, Didn't work out For you or for them? - Chuppa! I'll see you later I am so out of form these days! So, what is it? I have got a new job Go resign and return, as always! Listen! In Bengaluru! Are you nuts? Your Dad won't let you work even in Ernakulam... let alone Bengaluru! I think, I should take him with me this time Ah! That's a good idea, Chuppa - hm But... ...we'll have to present it tactically The usual methods won't work See, Given the date the body was found and its condition, this could be Day 14. Which body? Have you seen it? Huh? Eat... Eat as much as you can He has ruined this too! Alright! He is not dead. The body was not his, either. But he is dead to me. Do you have a problem with that? 14 or 16... ...with or without curd, you decide that for your own last rites What I offer my dad, is for me to decide Why don't you have the snacks and leave quietly instead of creating trouble? I don't eat from outside Why don't you just leave then? Dad! Hey Subramaniyan! Take him away Unbelievable! - Just unbelievable! What is unbelievable? The fellow was planning to kill his father So Kunjappan ran away. Surely, he isn't dead He dug up some dead body claiming it is Kunjappan's and is performing the last rites What he is doing is unbelievable! - That too is unbelievable! Uncle, the newspaper Has your blood sugar gone up? You look pale and thin Uncle, last night, there was a fantastic show on the TV "Crime Report" At Kollam... an old man living alone... ...of approximately your age... was gruesomely murdered by his neighbour Living alone is not safe at all! But I am not alone here Uncle... The lad has landed a job... ...in Bengaluru A good salary of Rs 1 Lakh a month You could move with him and we can let this house out on rent I can guarantee you a rent of ten thousand a month Over there, nobody could clobber your head off... You'll be safe! Prasannan Take up a job that would let you sleep in your own house No matter what Dad, shall I? Ground enough? Yeah! It's good to go No, itâ€™s not This is why you should not do this Dad! What job could I get here? Jobs don't come riding on their own to you. You need to look for them Where are you going? - Just to the play ground If you don't mind losing, join me for a game I do mind losing At least for a while? May be at night. I have some work now Jobs don't come riding on their own, do they? Aren't you going for work today? I will. Itâ€™s not time yet What time would that be? - I've got many apprentices there ...they will manage. It is a Pharma job after all That is what you always say Do I? - Yes, often No way! There he is! Are you taking your dad along to Bengaluru? Did he get a job there too? Yes, as a computer engineer! - No joke, Bengaluru is a hub of engineers, Let his dad too be one. There are so many elderly engineers around Old doctors and engineers are the most sought after ones Have you noticed? - That's right My dear Madhu, I am not going anywhere. A cup of tea, please Just like me Chuppan, can you go home immediately? Itâ€™s urgent. - What is it? Your father had a fall What happened? He fell down while washing clothes Bhaskaran, why would you live alone? Why don't you get him married? Move this bucket a bit Hmm... You're not taking the pills, are you? You don't have to yell. He is not deaf Really? I do Bhaskaran, skipping the pills won't do you any good If something happens, everyone suffers You do your job Don't waste it Why would I! I don't have much to do here. Itâ€™s a chronic disease You never know when he will kick the bucket We can only get him to take his medicines on time Get someone for the household chores How long will he do all this? He is an old man & get a job yourself. Aren't you an electronics engineer? Mechanical You have no hope! - Didn't I say so? Prasananan... We need a home nurse - For you? Not for meâ€¦ for the household chores and to look after Dad Oh, that kind of nurse Itâ€™s not the safest of ideas No women are safe here, is it? Why are you looking at me? He meant home nurses cannot be trusted They often steal things There is nothing to be stolen, but my dad There is an agency in Perumba, where you get good nurses If you had such plans, you could have told me Dad! Come on It is not that I told you yesterday. She is a home nurse What should I cook for dinner? What? What would you like to eat? Take her away The kitchen is that way Enough Wow, tastes just like Dad's cooking Because I made it Sir, he did not let me do anything, he did all the cooking Is she a Poduval? Mr. Bhaskaran Poduval, What lies in Caste! She is from a very reputed upper caste family in Haryana Her highly reputed upper caste family is much higher than Poduvals Isn't it ? How long have you known her? I met her today, at the agency hmm I know you are not the type What type? She is pregnant She has been vomiting continuously Three months - Congratulations! So... What do we do then? If there is nothing to do, I'll leave. Is that OK? Not O-K, V-K... I'm V-K Bhaskaran Poduval You can call me Bhaskaran You may leave OK That means alright in Hindi! Oh! Number seems unusual, might be some virus. You could lose money Hello! Have I not told you not to ride a motorbike? Are you taking your medicines regularly as advised? Dad, listen. Please hear me out I am 34 now. Look at my head... I am losing my hair Soon, I will go bald as Bharat Gopi! My classmates always tease me. - Where are you going? I have work to do Listen, 'Mate'! I have got yet another job This time in a Japanese company. I must go So, what about me? You come with me I am not coming to Japan! Those slanted eyes, short-legged fellows - just like you Everyone looks the same, almost like the Chinese Dad, the company is Japanese. my office would be in Russia Ah! That itself is dubious Is there no space in Japan that they set their office in Russia? Frauds for sure! Have your gruel and look for a job here Did you make me an engineer to work here in Payyannur? What else? To send you to Russia? Itâ€™s only a matter of four years There are many Malayalees there... ...and other friends too. I can visit frequently So, if I die, my dead body will be kept in a freezer until you come! I don't want myself freezing in one of those boxes Dad, stop fooling around please If I don't take up this job as well I will lose my mind and hang myself right here No matter what you say I will find a good home nurse, and take up this job I repeat, employing a home nurse is not a safe option I suggest you try that woman who is tending to Sreedharan's mother... Karthiyayini Hey, not her She is too old I didn't mean it that way. If you hire someone that old you'd have to get someone to look after her if she falls sick Bhaskaran will be looked after by Karthiyayini and Karthiyayini will be tended to by another nurse The three of them in that house will be a sight! Why would she need another person? She is a home nurse after all If something happens to her, she will look after herself Prasannan - Yes! Such a huge house for a single man? There were many people here. Some died and some went abroad Still... - What? You can make extensions to a house whenever. But can you remove them when the number of people decrease? Come on in How is it? Is there nothing here? But we are hiring you to make something How do I make something with nothing? Is there a mixer? Or a grinder? Thatâ€™s the fun part! Uncle does not like those machines. Everything should be hand-made. Not even a TV? Whenever you feel like watching TV, come over to my place You can watch your TV serials on your smartphone It will cost me some Gigabytes! One more thing Please remember, if you fall sick, you will be your own home nurse too and I will pay only for one of you'll So why don't you'll catch up while I go and bring them Hello! - Ah. Haven't seen you around in two days Got into some trouble I stitched a churidar for this girl It was a bit tight Heard her brother was after me So I was in hiding for two days Hiding! - Didn't even open the shop Did you tell the cops? - Nah! Can't you see me reading? Mani! - Yes! A tea for me, please You want it strong, right? - Absolutely! Murali... ... heard that you are being replaced in the temple committee, is it true? Who told you? - Rumors are doing rounds You are of no use to the temple, they say Did you put some cardamom? - Why not! you are like a brother, right? Is there any truth in it, Murali? - Why don't you have your tea and leave? Mani, I too want a teaâ€¦ but without the cardamom Why? - Do I look like your brother? I think I have seen her somewhere She is our new tenant... ...from Wayanad They moved here because of her daughter's studies - Oh, okay Let me take the news paper Hope you remember the terms. - I know Can you get some tea? - No, thanks! You are at my stall for the first time - The thing is my daughter is home alone She will be fine. A cup of tea won't take too long The tea here is quite famous Isn't it, Raghu? - Of course! Without sugar, please - Alright! "Do not use Soap in the temple pond" Brother! Aren't you Bhaskaran? - Yes I am Ramanan So? Didn't you take my 'Chandrika' soap? - I did not take anything A woman saw you taking it Haven't you seen the sign there reading soaps are not allowed? I can't read Malayalam I only have one. My wife bought it. - Move over My wife gave it to me Only you were there. Birds are not going to take it... â™ª I want my soap, please I think your sugar level has gone up again Prasannan... He has become thin as a rake Karthiyayini... Oh Come on... Karthiyayini! Huh! You said there was going to be one guy Yes, there will be only one person... "Bhaskaran" I will leave in a bit and Subramaniyan will leave tomorrow or else, I will leave now This spread is only because its the first day Enough Is she too from an â€˜upper casteâ€™? Go ahead! Don't worry. My father is a pure Brahmin Karthiyayini, we need to talk - You tell me Dad is particular about somethings... like He doesnâ€™t like food ground in the mixer or grinder, he wants his tea and medicines on time He is temperamental So I must keep my voice down and never talk back Moderate salt and no sugar and no singing. Isn't that it? How did you know? Did Prasannan tell you all this? - No need of telling all these I have come across many a demons. He is barely the worst So, thatâ€™s that then. Peace. You can fly off to Japan or Russia or wherever in peace as well Steel plates don't break Dad... Such an opportunity may not come again It hurts to leave you by yourself That's not true If you feel what you are doing is right, then you must go Really? Hmm I can't tie you up You are not a cow â™ª â™ª Karthiyayini, pack those chilly fryums He'll get those in Russia too Uncle, are you going to Russia too? Sure! He is at the right age for that Then who will take care of the cow? - Is the cow the problem? Of course! Cows are a major problem now Is it a problem there? - No To a place where you cannot get a bottle of good old ayurvedic oil... Nobody needs to take any trouble for me I'm not going anywhere, and I don't have any problem So those who go to Russia have a problem? Come on Prasannan! - Oh, I did not mean you I was wondering about international diplomacy Only those who do not have the courage to stay, flee their homeland Dad! There are women around There is very little and I am not sharing any of it. Women... Like I care! Apply it inside! Meant for exterior use only Unbelievable! - Its okay He does not have any bad intentions You don't right? Look at you, you are laughing! Such a nice smile! Let me take a picture Never seen you laugh so much Smile again You pea-brained giant! How come I was not informed that the IC is not in supply!

Glad to meet you Whatever you may be. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple My son built him, and he lives with me, moreover he believes in Hinduism I have my doubts Then how do you perform the rituals? Not that. I have my doubts about this fellow here. Where is the proof that he is Hindu? [RECITING A VERSE FROM BHAGAVAT GITA IN SANSKRIT] Got it? Don't make a scene. Stop him not! Let him proceed. Its Ramayana Chapter 3, 4th edition "Whatever you see as beautiful, glorious, or powerful, know it to..." "...spring from but a spark of my splendor..." ...as mentioned in Bhagavat Gita Chapter 10, Vibhootiyogam, Verse 41 Bro, that one isn't from the DC comics world Bhaskaran, kindly understand This machine will spoil the sanctity of the temple He is a Hindu - You don't get to decide that yourself But Murali, Hindus don't have Baptism... Hang on... Communists have no say in religious matters If a stranger claims he is your brother, will you just let him in your house? Would you? - No, I wonâ€™t Then you keep off Must he open up his chest and show that god resides within him? What a miracle! Good lord! Oh! Lord Hanuman, bless us! Railway station Donâ€™t make a scene, Mom. Delhi is not that far Call me as soon as you get there I'll see you online tomorrow Take care of Mom, please Saudamini, you shouldnâ€™t be crying now This is a big moment in her life. Cheer up! Let her cry. Let her cry all her pain out Kunjappan... - Yes, Mr.Bhaskaran You think Saudamini is on Facebook? If she is... Searching for Saudamini No man... none of those That's the one! She is the one... Saudamini Not bad! So Facebook is basically used to stalk people This should have been invented years ago Mom, I have got to go now I am starving You haven't eaten yet! Why don't you ever eat on time? I need to rush before the mess closes - Yes, please go have your food Oh, and hows Facebook working out for you? - Facebook, bah! Go on now Facebook Message from 'Sathyan' "I always wanted to tell you how much I was in love with you. Never had the courage" In Japan, you can express your love freely and openly Doesn't work like that here. We either rape or burn the girl first I am too old for any of these In Japan, you can get married to whomever you like and whenever you want When did I tell you I want to get married? And stop going on about Japan... It is small enough for four men with shovels on either side to dig up and throw it into the ocean Is that the case with India? The country is huge and so are our problems There you can get married even if you are old or even live together without getting married Damn, I wish I was born there! Here marriage is nothing but a license to buy groceries Hmm Hey...! Even Chuppan does not know about Saudamini You are increasingly behaving like a typical Malayalee... please don't start gossiping about this to others Of course not Looks like Bhaskaran Poduval used to have a one-sided love affair Oh.. Really! Like a loan given to Vijay Mallya, a non-performing asset Oh, nice! How much is this? Rs. 150 Two Ten? Ten Five.. How much? So the change? You still owe me a rupee Yes, that I will give you next month We don't need the newspaper from tomorrow What? - I read online now What about the joy of reading an actual paper? Well, there is joy in this too My eye sight is poor On a screen, you can zoom in and make it larger Kunjappan... a merciless death awaits you! upon the good lord! You don't get away with hurting someone in the press Better check your horoscope! Sir, snacks Serve it to him too He doesnâ€™t drink We make offerings to god as well, even if they don't actually eat it Keep it there Thank you We need his time and date of birth and his sun sign Hi, Dad I need the his time of birth What? - Well, I need it along with the Date I donâ€™t know, give me a moment Do you know Kunjappan's date of birth? You mean date of manufacturing? 8 January 2019 08-01-2019 Those around him, including you, only have to gain from his company However, this is not a good phase for him He may have the wrath of many foes. Perhaps causing some stomach problems Maybe a virus? Like what affects mobiles and computers? His eyes could be affected as well. Maybe a scratch on his lenses? Avoid long distance travel. Your family goddess seems to be unhappy Nothing to worry. Everything has a remedy Make an offering at the Payyanur temple and... ...perform a manikin ritual at the Chamundi temple in Adukumala, Wayanad As soon as possible. There have been positive results Stay positive Hi Uncle! Where did you'll go to? To the astrologer - Why? Got his horoscope checked Got a sanctified amulet for him to ward off the evil eye Lets go - Is everything... ... else alright? Hey! Get in quick You could catch a cold! I would have taken those Why take a chance Didnâ€™t you hear the Astrologer? There is threat to your life even Who do I have if something happens to you? Subramaniyan, Prasannan They'll get old and die and then who'll I have? The cessation of life processes that occurs only in living organisms for various reasons including aging, suicide, murder disease, accident, and starvation... ...is known as Death. This is not applicable for a Robot. Many who thought so have gone on to become photographic memories and roadside busts for crows to shit on. You won't be different either One can erase me. My memory could be deleted Then? - Then you can sell me as scrap You can change the password and add a fingerprint After that, you alone can erase me Nobody can see my activities unless you approve Otherwise? Subramaniyan can watch everything you do through this camera All of it? - Of course Is my lunch ready? - Just a moment There is no curry. Get some from Prasannan's hotel As always How many dosas are there? - Six Yeah, don't reduce that now You've been brushing forever - Breakfast is not ready yet Raghu, you have got the lyrics wrong - Will keep that in mind Always sings it wrong, good for nothing Oh Lord! Stay with me and guide me Raghu... Is the blouse ready? It will be ready in a moment, you take a ride and come back Isn't that what you always say - Go and come son It better be ready by the time I return. Else, I will burn the bloody shop down Raghu... - Bhaskaran! I need to stitch a shirt - Why not? Dosa - Put it back. It's his lunch Not for me, itâ€™s for him I have grown to stitch a shirt for a robot, I am honored! Shoulder 34; Arm 50; Chest 44; Waist 28; Height 40 What a memory! I need an assistant here, are you game? There is no need for him to work Mind you, my father has made enough money already Isnâ€™t it better if he earns something? Who will look after him when he gets old? - I will What did you say your height was? - 40â€ Come after a couple of days - Okay Where is the cloth? [SINGING] Is it done? Get the money from my Dad. - Alright! Are you drunk today as well? How did you know? You seem to have dressed for work today Where are you going? For Radha's daughter's wedding. I'll have lunch there I am starving - I havenâ€™t cooked, you come with me I am not invited Neither am I. But I am attending You got a new blouse made for a wedding you weren't invited to! Do I go without one because I was not invited? A portion of curry please Curry & Blouse, eh? Where is that packet? I ate it What! You ate my new blouse? You try to seduce my wife with Dosas, you scum! I know she is pretty, but she doesn't need your dosas Stop it! - I did nothing, Kunjappan swapped it Leave me He will die by my hands, you mark my words Let it go Why should I mark his words? - Right Who is Mr.Bhaskaran Poduval? - Itâ€™s me We are from the municipality - Hello! We have got a complaint against you Do you have the license to run this? I don't need a license, I don't run it It runs on its own Listen, you need sanction from the government to run such machines Will you take the responsibility if it attacks somebody? Prasannan... What happened, Uncle? - Call Chuppan The municipality took Kunjappan away Why do they need a robot? Quick... Hi Prasannan - Chuppan... Some â€˜Robot catchersâ€™ from the municipality have taken Kunjappan Apparently, we need a license The municipality? Is Dad around? - Talk to him Hello? - Dad, what happened? Kunjappan was home as usual, they came and took him Don't worry Dad They can't take him away. Nothing will happen Go home... Kunjappan will come home soon But how could they take that kid It's not safe these days What if they do something to him? He canâ€™t even cry I don't think I can be at peace without him Dad... Here What happened? I think he has begun to think of the robot as his son The world has gone rogue ever since the computer and the internet came along Now the people are going to use this Robot to help them with their crimes Switching a dosa with a blouse is a cyber-crime? There wasn't even in any curry in it! I don't know all that Get an undertaking from the police that they take responsibility We'll see then Will they give it? - How would I know? Ask them Why is the communist party interested in helping the damned Robot? So many home nurses are going to lose their jobs to it There you are wrong For issues like property disputes, infidelity, loan-sharking etc ...the party has mediating for years now Thatâ€™s how it works here Sir, there is a message from the Prime Minister's office Officer! Did Charles Shobaraj use the internet to commit his crimes? Did Sukumara Kuruppu use WhatsApp for his murders? Did those 42 men rape that 16-year-old for 40 days in Suryanelli with the help of... ... Google? Yes... Google? Did Lord Krishna have 16008 wives, because he had a Facebook account? Exactly! Itâ€™s because of your incompetence! What! What did I do? What kind of a brother-in-law are you? Useless! Listen... sit. What can I get you to drink? I donâ€™t want anything. - You stopped drinking? The wig... Why did you let it go? This was sent by his son. The sanction from the PM to use the robot I had no option - Our Prime Minister? Who else? Only we don't have access to him Isn't he always abroad! He signed an MoU in Japan to import 50 such Robots across the next 5 years This is a trial run How is that possible? Wasn't it on a 4-month trial? You must return it Sir, I'll buy it somehow I can understand your situation, but that machine isn't for sale. I could lose my job This is surely the handiwork of Babu Now, nobody can do anything. Let alone Babu The mail my son sent was that powerful Bhaskaran, How much is your sonâ€™s salary? Why? It'll be fun to know Knowing won't be fun. Earning will be I donâ€™t think he will return it What the hell! Donâ€™t you understand? Go, get it back I need the machine back as is. I donâ€™t care if you have to kill your father Hey, Chuppan stop! Two out of the four machines that went for the trial run have failed If anything happens to your father, we are done I am saying this for your own good Stop it! A message from Saudamini What's the message? "Who are you" Oh! [Message] "Thought I'd forgotten you, memories came back when I saw you again" Mr. Bhaskaran, would you like to live in the future world?

Let him take rest I want to listen to some music The situation is more serious than we thought Should we just shut it down? No no... We just need to be careful If we take him forcefully, it will be a shock We should convince him I am sure he will understand He seems like a nice man. We should be with him always Hi Kunjappan! Who is this? Is this a new Robot? She is my friend Thank you Mr. Bhaskaran, we need to talk in private What? Something he hasn't even told his son I need to use the loo What? - The toilet... Come... I need to use it Good bye, Subramaniyan This is what I was telling you about. I think he is losing his mind In 35 years, I don't think he even prayed for me once And he has gotten its horoscope checked Well, no point blaming him Who gives an old man such a toy?

Who did you say made this? Hitomi Do you think Iâ€™m I am a fool? Huh? That piece of metal scrap took care of me, for the last 3-4 months Despite all my antics, ...he fed me, he bathed me, made me laugh Never disobeyed me or talked back to me ...nor did it scare me, till now Didnâ€™t you tell me to treat it as a child and teach it everything?

Does it? Do you value this machine more than me? When did I ignore you, Dad? When I was idling away here with you, Have you shown this affection to me? This machine will definitely kill you Dad He wonâ€™t do any harm to me.

I had to live there for some years, looking after our land and crops During that time, she married someone else And when I was ready for marriage, they got me married too I eventually forgot her Love is like that If not maintained well... ...it will crumble down like an abandoned house You wonâ€™t understand all that You are not old enough for that Yes, I would not understand I am programmed only to assist you I am not a human Get lost you! What Subramaniyan said is right They will find me no matter where we go hiding They will take me back and erase my memories What good are we without our memories?
