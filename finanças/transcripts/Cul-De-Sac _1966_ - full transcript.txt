No. I could've sworn Teresa showed you the whole castle. - No, she didn't. - Would you like to see it? No, I'd rather get home now, darling, before it gets too dark. - Are you sure? - It never gets dark in this blasted place. - Christopher! - Are you all right with that thing? I think so. So he used to work up behind the stained glass, did he? That's right. You have a fantastic view from there. - Christopher! - It's really rather moving. - What is it now? - [Woman] Oh, there you are, darling. - Do come down. We're leaving now. - On a clear day, you can see right across the bay. - All right, all right! - The most fantastic view. Oh, here's your binoculars. I nearly forgot to give them to you. - Thank you so much. - What are you doing on Sunday? I think we've got some people coming actually. Well, we were having some people over here.

It's so - - We must get the tide right, dear. - You don't want to brave those ocean waves again. - No, I don't. - Do say good-bye to Teresa for us. - Yes, I will. She'll be very disappointed. I'm sorry we didn't see her before we went. [Man] Oh, Christopher, I've hardly seen you. Where have you been? - I've been shrimping. - Shrimping? What, with Teresa? [Woman] Bye-bye then.

You'll be taking off in a minute.

How would do you do that? Oh, you could tie them - Little pieces of paper - tie them around... - and then you force them up. - Sounds a bit tricky. - [George] Why don't I give you - - [Man] Well, we'll give you a ring, shall we? - [Man] What's your number? - One-one. - Oh, one-one. - That's double-one. - [Man] Double-one-one. - [Muttering] One-one. - [George] No. Just one-one. - [Muttering] One-one.

Well - Now you really are being nasty to me. I don't want to talk anymore! They're all whores! I don't give a damn for you or your goddamn love life. [George Chuckling] Will that bloody tide be down tomorrow or not? Uh, I think - I'll have to consult the almanac. Consult an almanac! You gotta be out of your skull to live in a hole like that! Will that bloody tide be down tomorrow morning, or will it? - Answer yes or no! - Yes. - What do you mean yes? - The bloody tide will be down. - What time? - I don't know. I have to check. - What's going on? - Baby, baby, come on! What's going on? - Come and join us! - What were you shooting? No, Dickie loosed off a few shots. - [Imitating Gunfire] - What? He was shooting. He thought it was Katelbach. - [Laughing] - You're pissed. We just are having a quiet little talk. - [Laughing] - Let me alone! Let me alone! Go away! [George Continues Laughing] - Go away! - Ah! Baby! Baby, come here. Dickie's rather nice. Darling, let me take it for you. - Baby - - Go away! Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby! Come back, baby! Baby, come back. Darling, come on.

I'm coming! - You did nothing! Nothing at all! - Teresa - Teresa - You were in a blue funk the whole time. Don't you understand? They're ready to shoot us down like dogs. How do we get out of here? [Shouting] How? Be quiet. [Whispering] Be quiet. The main thing is that Dickie should go off with his gang. [Footsteps] [Lock Clicking] Why didn't you tell me? Why? [Gasps] What have I - What have I done? You were expecting someone. Someone? - What? - They're here. Outside. No time to talk. One word about me, and I'll let her have it. The first one is for you. [Seagulls Squawking] [Car Doors Closing] [Man] George! George! George! Oh, it's good to see you again! - What on earth are you doing here? - [Man Laughs] It is good to see you! [Laughing] Oh, so this is were you've been hiding yourself, is it? Yes. [Chuckles] You're a dark horse, you know. Oh - What's the matter? Is there something wrong? You look a bit put out. Aren't you glad to see us? - Yes, of course I am. - [Footsteps Approaching] Oh, darling. - This is my wife, Teresa. - How do you do? Old friends of mine, darling - Mr. And Mrs. Fairweather. - How are you? How very nice to meet you. - And Cecil Yorke. - Jacqueline. - Cecil has a divine place near here. Oh! But nothing like this castle of yours. - Well - - Treasure? Where are you, treasure? Where has the little monster gone? You know, Marion had a grudge against you for a long time, old chap. [Marion] Thanks to Cecil, we can at last meet your wife. Oh, she is gorgeous. Oh, dear me, all these chickens. [Rooster Crows] Come here, my darling. Come and say "How do you do?" Must have cost you a pretty penny. Oh. Dear lady, please forgive this intrusion. But it was the only way we could get to meet you and to congratulate you. My poor child, keeping you cloistered up here in this - - Oh, Philip, listen. - Yes? Of course! Pardon me a moment. Oh. Thank you. Have you got the - Is the boot open? You're getting to be a big boy now, aren't you, Nicholas? [Laughs] [Marion] Horace. You know, we mustn't spoil this lovely kite. Must we, my little Horace? Or else when we want it to fly, it won't work. Will it? [Objects Clattering In Box] [Footsteps Approaching] [Objects Clattering In Box] Ah. Well - [Chuckles] Well, it's rather late, but please accept this little offering. And - [Kisses] Let me kiss you and wish you every happiness with this old devil George... - because, by Jove, you deserve it! - [George Murmuring] - James, bring the drinks in. - [Philip Chattering] Well, you see, Marion thought that a really useful present like this - Just let me show you. Ah. Here we are. Now - Ah. You hold that for a moment. There now. Now, here's the book of instructions. Uh - Uh, yes. Well, you'd better look at that. Um - Now, here - - Will it cook a chicken? - Yes. [Laughs] That's right, a chicken. Or anything. James, there is a tray. [George] Darling, with his arm - That's no excuse! It was always understood by the master... that I was simply engaged to look after the garden... and help a bit with the chickens. For once you can lend a hand. I'm doing the best I can, madam. Anyway, that's all there is. There's plenty of everything in the wine cellar. You know where that is, don't you? Uh, shall I go? With his arm, you know - - N'est-ce pas, ch?rie? - Get the basket from the kitchen. George will never change. - [Philip] He's a Yank, isn't he? - Oh, Dickie, uh - James is first-rate. But he has his little ways. He's wearing a Christian Dior tie. Look! Leave the kite alone! Let the child have his fun! One would think you had never been young. [Richard] Out of the way, kid. James... cook a chicken for lunch in this. What do you mean cook a chicken for lunch in this? Of course. Don't stare like that. You kill a chicken and you cook it in this pressure cooker. Not on your life. I ain't killing no chicken, madam. George will do it very well. Oh, no. No, no. No, no. I'm sorry. [Chuckles] You'll see. There won't be a single man around to kill this chicken. I want to kill the chicken. You are still far too small. Go and play in the garden. Yes, come on. Off you go. Go on. Go and play. All right then. Go and catch some shrimps. Madam, with my arm? Make an omelet. [Richard Sighs] Shall I give you a hand? For an omelet? You must be joking, sir. And this is the author room. Oh. Not a very big room. [Teresa] He worked by himself. [Marion] Oh. Wasn't there anyone? [Teresa] His slippers. His pipe. [Teresa, Marion Continue Chattering] [Teresa, Cecil Chattering] [Philip] Well, George, you sly old dog! [Laughing] [George] What do you mean "sly old dog"? [Philip] Oh, you know. Oh, it is nice to see you. - [Philip Laughs] - [George] Nice to see you. Everything all right? Yes, of course. Everything's perfectly all right. No, but I mean really all right. Hmm? Why shouldn't everything be all right? As you see, I'm a happy man. I've, uh - I'm retired from business. I - I'm taking things easy. [Teresa] And his old - [Indistinct] glasses. - [Marion] Ah, they're lovely. - [Sighs] [Marion Continues, Indistinct] Heard from Agnes? [George] No. [Philip Clears Throat] Well, now, if there's anything at all that you need - - What are you driving at? - You know, any kind of - any kind of an emergency. You must be joking. I don't know what's the matter with you all. I told you I - I've sold my factory. I'm living the life of Riley. [Chuckles] Take my word for it, old chap. All right, all right. I won't insist. But I want you to know that you can always rely on me. And don't hesitate. Now, I won't say another word. That's just as well. - What about you? Are you - - Are you expecting someone? Yes. No. Well, at least, uh, I'm not. You know, Philip... you really are beginning to get on my nerves. [Marion] Did he sleep here? - [Cecil] St. Cuthbert? - [Marion] No, our famous author. [Teresa] This is his desk. And he wrote all his books with this. - He wrote it with this? - Yes. That is one of the original pens. Uh, this may interest you too - a few pages of the diary. This is where he actually wrote it, you know. Oh, so it's not just a story? A story? Of course it wasn't a story. But, yes. There was a film. Philip, you remember. We saw it at the Majestic. - Majestic, dear? - Yes, you know very well. With that actor - - A letter. - [Philip] The little short chap? [Marion] Yes, with the beard. - [Philip] Are you sure it was the Majestic? - Yes, yes. A color film with all those kilts. - Do you remember? - [Philip] Kilts, kilts. No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry, I don't. - He has no memory. - Oh! I have other things to remember than the silly cinema nonsense. But you couldn't have forgotten. Actually, I had to make the whole row stand up because of Horace. - [Philip] Oh, yes, of course I remember! Oh! - [Mouthing Words] Bonnie Prince Charlie? No, no! The Roundheads! The Roundheads, with all those bagpipes? [Laughs] Jacobites. [Richard] Hey, you little brat, stop digging there! Will you excuse me? [Clears Throats] He can't bear to have anybody interfere with his - - [Teresa] Flower beds. - Flower beds. [Clucking] You are rather too easygoing. I wouldn't put up with that fellow's language. Yes, I know, but good gardeners are awfully difficult to come by, you know. And we have the entire grounds to get into shape. [Cecil] You'll ruin that painting hanging it over the fireplace. - Oh, it doesn't matter. - [Teresa] George painted it. Geo - Oh! It's a very good likeness. It is the view from the beach, isn't it? Yes. George has done quite a few. That's the best one. As a matter of fact, he is going to have an exhibition. What on earth are you talking about? You're going to have an exhibition? Hey, you've been hiding things from us. When are you going to have this show? Surely you can see Teresa's pulling both your legs. She's teaching me to work in oils. I'm just a Sunday painter like a thousand others. Grandma Moses. [George] My poor Marion. You really say anything that comes into your head. [Marion] What do you mean anything that comes into my head? You know, I remember at school you were always damn good at sketching. Grandma Moses was never a Sunday painter. That's no excuse for treating me like a fool. [Sighs] Let me tell you, honey, it wasn't very smart to ask these people to stay for food. Let me tell you, honey, that you have nothing to complain about. Can I help? No, no, thank you. It's all right. What if my friends show up now, hmm? They will find it quite a job... - to pack us all into the wine cellar. - ♪♪ [Phonograph: Jazzy] Laid out, I could pile up quite a few, couldn't I? [Record Needle Scratching] ♪♪ [Continues: Sped Up, Distorted] ♪♪ [Continues] ♪♪ [Stops] [Chattering Outside] Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ow! [Richard] That's it! Smack him good! - Ow! - Nobody asked your opinion! [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] Here, here, here, here! What's the matter with - Marion! Marion! What is it? Treasure, what happened? That froggy bitch pulled my ear off! Here, here, here! Who taught you to speak like that? - Mummy did! - [Exclaims] That'll teach you to lie! [Chuckles] [Philip] Wait. We didn't come here for a meal, you know? All we wanted was the pleasure of being together. - [Clattering] - Oh, I'm sorry. [Sighs] Anyway - [Laughs] We won't be short of mead, will we? [Laughs] [Richard, Posh Accent] If these ladies and gentlemen... wished to be properly welcomed... they should have had the courtesy to have telephoned in advance. By the way, is your telephone out of order? Uh, uh - Out of order? - Well, nobody answered. - Oh, yes. Uh - No, that is, um - I, uh - I think we must have been down on the beach. Aye. That's what we thought, wasn't it? [Laughs] Cheers. [Boat Approaching] [Cecil, Teresa Chattering] [Motor Stops] This - [Mutters] [Marion] Oh, that child isn't eating a thing. I want to get down! Now don't swing your legs like that. Eat up. - Now listen to your mother and eat up. - I want to get down! [Philip] Oh, no use forcing him, love. All right. Come on. Off you go. Go and play. Go on. Ooh. Ooh! Christopher. A young neighbor of ours. His parents own a, um - a villa across the bay. - Would you care for a bite? - Uh, no, thank you. I've already eaten. Did you get home all right last night? Yes, yes. Mother was seasick again, but we got home okay. [Laughing] I can make it. Did you buy that at Vince? Vince? I have a girlfriend who has one just like it. She bought it at Vince in Carnaby Street. This is a man's sweater. I know. She only wears men's sweaters. It's all right. [George] James. Have you had your sweet? It's all right. [Exhales] Try this. - Strong? - Remarkable. I make it myself. [Cecil] You're very talented, aren't you? [Teresa] Well, that anyway. [Clears Throat] [Whispering, Indistinct] [Teresa Laughing] Not bad, this mead, is it? Mmm. [Chickens Cooing] [George] Mmm. ♪♪ [Jazz: Loud] ♪♪ [Stops] [Cooing Continues] Ah! - [Marion] Horace! Put that down at once! - [George] What? Do you hear me? Never aim a gun at people! - He's got a gun! - A gun! - [Glass Shatters] - That's my gun. [Teresa Laughing] [Chickens Clucking] [Footsteps Running] [George] Incredible. It was loaded. [Cecil] Of course it wasn't. It was in the boot of the car. - How could he possibly have loaded it? - Yes! How did you load it, eh? How, eh? You little - If only you looked after him more carefully! [George] Look what happened to the stained-glass window. [Laughing] Let's look. [Marion] Oh, thank goodness that's all it is. All it is, huh? It's a St. Cuthbert stained-glass window. Oh, don't make a drama out of it. We'll replace your windowpanes. - Windowpanes, is it? - [Arguing Continues] [Both Laughing] [Teresa] It's completely ruined! No one's been hurt. That's the main thing. Yes, that would have been the last straw. Look, I'll make good the damage to your stained glass. How could one possibly replace a St. Cuthbert stained-glass window? [Philip] Well, if that's the way you're going to take it, look, we'd better be off. We shouldn't have contacted our friend without first acquainting him - [Continues, Indistinct] Look, it's quite obvious we're in the way, aren't we? Hmm? From the first moment you set eyes on us, you had one thing on your mind... - and that was to get us off this island. - Quite so. You let your filthy little brat get up to his disgusting tricks. Besides - Ooh! I know perfectly well why you came. - You needn't take me for a fool. - He knows why. You hear that? He knows why. I know what I'm talking about. It was the same with Agnes, wasn't it? - May I ask what you're implying? - Will you kindly shut your trap. Obviously marriage does not suit you, my poor George. Your poor George is telling you to go to hell. - Philip, do you hear that? Say something. - Nag, nag! Nagging bitch! That's all you are. All you care about is your gossip. Your nag, nag, chitter-chatter - [Imitating Rapid Chattering] - That's your only aim in life. - Poor George. Poor George. It was bound to end like this. He's gone completely off his rocker because of that tart. - Say that again. - Tart! She's a tart. One has only to look at you to see that she'd go to bed with anything in trousers. The tart, as you call her, happens to be my wife. Now take back your bloody filthy insinuations and get the hell out of my... fortress. [Laughs] - Fortress. Get out! Get out! - [Laughing] Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out. Your painting is extremely interesting. Really, I like it very much. - Delighted to have made your acquaintance. - Oh. [Car Doors Closing] [Engine Starts] Shall we go shrimping? Leave me alone. [Car Departing] What's the matter? Don't you want to? To bring back as many as yesterday? Can't you understand that madam doesn't feel like going shrimping with you... young man? [Motor Starts] [Boat Departing] [Clears Throat] How much longer are you going to stay here waiting for your Katelbach? [Chuckles] Listen. Nobody knows that you're here. You have my word as an officer. We're acting loyally. Just the same, you - You can't stay here forever, can you? Teresa and I, we, uh - Honestly, you - Cut it out, George. [Coughs] [Richard] I'll stay here as long as I have to. Believe me... it ain't no fun.
