Based on a true story Sinner a film by Meni Philip "We and our forefathers have transgressed." "Forgive us, Father, for we have sinned." "Grant us atonement, for we have transgressed." I have to speak to the Rabbi. The Lord's tests are not aimed to fail us. Yes Yotam. May I talk to the Rabbi? Certainly, that's what I'm here for. Can we talk in private? Joseph. Yes? I need some spiritual guidance. Today is Friday, right? Go prepare for Shabbat, and come to see me in my room after the evening meal. Come in. Good Shabbat. Welcome Yotam. Come, sit next to me. Help yourself. Eat. So, what's happening? What did you want to talk about? I can't explain. Has it something to do with the "Holy union"? So you have inappropriate thoughts? Fantasies? Do you know that it could lead to wet dreams? But don't worry, I sometimes have such thoughts too. - Really? - Of course. Everyone sometimes has sinful thoughts, the challenge is to overcome the urge. There are many ways to help it. - Do you go to the Mikve? (Ritual bath) No. That's no good, you must go to the Mikve at least once a week. It always helps me. Who is it? - Shiye Potshonovsky. - Shiye, you shouldn't burst in like that. We'll talk later, OK? And close the door behind you. And don't come in like this again! What's the problem Yotam? You know the phrase: "Care in the heart of a man boweth it down"? When something is bothering you, it's better to talk about it. I did a bad thing. So it's even more important that you tell me. If you want to honestly repent, you must tell. Do you remember our studies? Confession is the first act after transgression, isn't it? I can't go to the mikve. Why? I'm too dirty to bathe in holy water. Something happened to my leg. What is it? It's embarrassing. You don't need to feel embarrassed. No one can see. Where is it? Here. Let me see. Some dirt you have here. It's a girl, ha...? You drew it yourself? Can you draw one for me too? Just kidding. It's Shabbat today, drawing is forbidden. I can see you enjoy it. I think I'll better go now. Easy Yotam... Come closer Yotami. All is fine. Be quiet. All is fine. There is no sadness... There is no sadness, no sadness in the world... For those who worship God. There is no sadness... There is no sadness... no sadness in the world... For those who worship God. There is no sadness... There is no sadness... no sadness in the world... For those who worship God." Yotam. Come. Can you please move? Good Shabbat. Good morning. "I thank you, everliving God." "Who, in mercy, returns my soul to me." Good Shabbat. LOCKING DORM'S DOORS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. "I thank you, everliving God." "Who, in mercy, returns my soul to me." Good morning. Wakey wakey! Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning Rabbi. Good morning. Good Shabbat. Shiye. Good Shabbat Shiye, wake up. Good morning. It could be something that fell from a bag, right? Where? On... On private property. I want to come back home. But you'll be home in a week time. I want to come now. Why, what happened? Nothing happened, I just don't like it here. Hold on, your father wants to talk to you. - Yotam? - Yes dad. You are not coming home now, do you understand? - But I am not... - No buts. I know it's hard for you at the moment, but it will be better soon. - Yotam, did you hear me? - E... yeah. Go and have a rest now, tomorrow everything will be fine. OK dad... Bye. LOCKING DORM'S DOORS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." Good morning. Good morning. Wake up. Why did you do this? Good morning. Open it! Open it! Criminals! What were you doing behind closed doors? I locked the door, Shlomo had nothing to do with it. What happened? What did they do? I think they locked the door. I bet they'll be expelled. Rabbi Moshe told me what you were doing last night. Such behaviour in our Yeshiva? You have committed one of the biggest sins in the eyes of our Lord. -But we didn't... -What didn't you? Why did you lock the door then? I was scared. Scared? There is nothing to be scared of here. I was scared that... What happened? Don't be afraid, do tell me. King Soloman, the wisest man ever, said: "Care in the heart of a man, boweth it down." Perhaps if you tell me you'll feel better. Nothing happened. Something frightened me. Alright then, go back to your studies. Come here. Come. -What did you tell the Headmaster? -I didn't tell him anything. Do you know that he expelled Shlomo? What? -We didn't do anything. -Oh, yes you did! But don't worry, I persuaded him to give you a second chance. I promised him that I will look after you personally. Come closer Yotam. Yotam. Yotami.
