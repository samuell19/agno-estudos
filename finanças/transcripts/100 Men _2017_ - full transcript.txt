Growing up in New Zealand, I went with a bunch of my schoolmates who were into surfing. They were diving into the ocean, and they looked amazing. I mean, it - it was difficult because in some ways I fancied them, you know, they were sexy guys. And I was thinking this is fantastic, but I can never be part of that. They are going to have happy lives. A few years ago, I started to make a list of all the men I'd met through sex, and there have been a lot. Initially, it was just because I didn't want to forget so many wonderful encounters. But then it became something more. I began to track some of them down. I was overwhelmed when you told me about this idea, this crazy project. I will ask my mum to take a sleeping pill before she sees this film. Been strange, you know? "Hi. We haven't talked, we bonked fifteen years ago a couple of times, um, can I come and do an interview with you?" I mean, you have no problems being, appearing in this, and... No no. There are, there are things... because I wasn't sure what we'd talk about, because obviously, we met through, through sex, didn't we? You know. - It's all right to say that? - Yeah. No. Absolutely. In a way, I love history, and this was a way of exploring history from a very personal angle. As a filmmaker, I realized that counting down a hundred of the most memorable from my list was a way to look at how thing had changed for gay men in my lifetime. Yeah Pita, as in the bread. The reason he is number a hundred is, it's simply when I started writing this up. Mostly my countdown is in chronological order. But to tell the story, sometimes it makes sense to break the rules. I grew up in New Zealand, and had recently returned after many years in the UK. Soon after getting back, I went to a sex-on-site cruise club in Auckland. I met this fantastic Maori guy who was absolutely beautiful. I mean, he was, mid-30s, fantastic physique; he was every fantasy. We went and had sex, and I asked him to come back. And he said he couldn't. He wasn't out. Of course, I couldn't track him down, but it got me thinking... I wondered how much New Zealand had really changed since I grew up here in the 70s. My parents were very religious, a fairly fundamentalist puritan religion. I think somewhere around that time, my Dad gave me the church book on sexuality... and I began to put two and two together. I met the next guy on the list, Mr. Raglan, recently and he also had a religious upbringing. It was a very simple conflict. I mean, I knew I was gay very early on, and the church thought that was a sin. I actually prayed, you know. - I said, "God make me straight." - Oh yeah. I've got journals of just heart-wrenching outpourings of pleading, you know. Pleading for change and healing, and to be better, and to do the right thing. And I was literally officially a missionary; I came to New Zealand as a missionary to work with the church. - You are originally from Canada? - So, I'm from Canada. I grew up in a small farming town, population five hundred, village, Brethren church community. So, my upbringing, my social life, was church and family. I was sixteen when I first plucked up courage to go into a dirty bookshop. He actually wouldn't even be on the list, if it weren't for the fact that it was the first. It was certainly not memorable sex. There were some contact magazines... so I wrote a letter and agreed to meet someone in a motel. It was terrifying. I'm thinking, "God, am I going to go through with this?" For a period, right after the first time, I thought, "Okay, it's a phase. It'll be fine." And I was determined to become straight. There was very little alternative, something I found talking to others on the list, like a journalist I met in the UK some years later. There was nothing out there. There was literally nothing out there. I remember there's a, I, my parents didn't have that many books in the house. But, um, they did have this awful Pears Encyclopedia from about 1967, and I used to look at it all the time for the definition of homosexuality. And it talked about homosexuality as a disease that could be cured with electric shocks. What did you do about it? I -I tried to seduce all of my school mates, obviously. Um, and-and successfully actually, with quite a few of them. One of the teachers giving a talk, it was in a sex education class, he came up with a theory that you could always tell homosexuals because they strike matches away from themselves. And I was sitting in the class thinking, "Do I strike matches towards me or away from me?" I'm not quite sure. Jones is one, you know. Yeah, you can tell. He strikes matches away from him. What's that supposed to mean? I dunno. Read it in the paper. Nah. They are not all like that. Some act normal. You might be one. Yeah I know. Give us a kiss. Fuck off. I'd heard about a beach where gay men went cruising. Met somebody there, and had sex with him there on the beach. That was when it really started to get heavy because I then knew this wasn't just a phase. I entered a world of clandestine cruising, meeting people in parks, beaches, toilets. This strange world, it's like a subterranean culture that exists. And that becomes in itself quite exciting. I was still going to school. By this time, I'd been made a deacon in the church. I was getting very little sleep. And it started to spiral out of control. It was around that time that I thought, "Right, I'll give my life to God, he'll make me straight, and I'll go off and become a preacher." So, I headed off to a seminary run by the church. Did you believe, did you have faith? Because I actually went off, I actually went off to become a preacher. - I went to, I went to a seminary. - Yeah, yeah. And I looked into going to bible college as well. ♪ Deep river ♪ ♪ My home is over Jordan ♪ I was at the Church Seminary for about eight months. It was a boarding place, and to be absolutely honest, I nearly went mad. I started to hallucinate. ♪ Oh, don't you want to go ♪ I just thought, "I don't want to go mad. I don't care about being straight anymore, I don't care about what other people think of me." And I certainly decided that I was not interested in becoming a preacher. ♪ I want to cross over ♪ ♪ Into campground ♪ A lot of the people we talked to, myself included, the religious aspect, in terms of, being gay, caused us huge problems. Was that the case with yourself? No, actually not. Um, my, um, my father is a Methodist minister, my stepmother is a Catholic ex-nun. Um, but they are both very liberal, socialist tree-huggers. Um, when I came out to them in a letter at fifteen, ah, I also told them at the same time that I'd started smoking. And I got a letter back saying how devastated they were about the smoking, and they didn't care about the gay. When I got back from the seminary, I went to a sauna and started meeting interesting people, like James. I know. It's that name, ah, after a breakfast cereal. Who came up with the name? Well, there's two teams. We're Cheerios, and the other one is called Fruit Loops. So, we are, kind of, like, the cereal brand of gay men that play touch on a Monday night here, Paul. Did you always know you were gay? Yep... had sex with the neighbor's, ah, neighbor's, one of the brothers. There was five brothers next door. Must been about eleven or twelve. He must have been about thirteen or something. And I got a feeling my parents knew I was gay, but they didn't want to believe it either. Especially, you know, in my twenties when I used to bring home a dear friend. They used to call them. "Oh, that's James' friend." These were older European men. So, you know, ten years older than me. So, if you knew you were gay, why did you get a girlfriend? Fuck, I wasn't gonna... I wasn't gonna tell people back then, ah, Paul. I wasn't going to let them know. Why? Oh, probably because the people I was with, you know, um... people like me... street people, gang people. Your father said he used to beat the living daylights out of people like you. Brogan, a friend I've met more recently, also comes from a tough background. My father has always told me that, you know, be a man, get a girlfriend, get a job. I suppose in a way it was to, kind of, scare me to go straight. Living in a council estate wasn't the easiest thing in the world. You said you came out at fifteen. - Was that to everybody? - Yes, yes. And how did that go down in Burnley? I spent most of my life at school being chased around the corridors being called, "Poof, poof, poof, poof, poof." Ah, but so did my sisters, so I don't think they quite understood the word. I mean, one of the consequences of that problematizing of, of sexuality is it, ah, is it emotionally retards a lot of gay men, I think. Because a lot of that exploration we should be doing publicly. Falling in love, breaking up, having the fights, having crushes, all the stuff that our straight friends are doing, we can't do publicly. And I think there is certain emotional retardation. Ah, a lot of stuff gets delayed until the twenties or, or late teens, which, um, which is a shame really. I met a guy who used to make beautiful rugs. He was quite a lot older. I was seventeen, and he was probably in his forties and lived by himself. And it was quite sad in a way because he loved me coming round, and it wasn't even for the sex, it was just the fact that I'd sit and talk to him. And I thought this is sad, and I thought, "This is my future." The other person I met at the sauna was Douglas. Douglas told me that he was working there to earn money to continue his dance work. In those days, he was just starting out. For some reason that, that stuck in my head, and over the years, I managed to follow his career. Didn't ever talk to him since. I tracked him down, and I told him what I was doing and said, "Look, I'd love to come and interview you." So, he said, "Yes" and we did an interview. The Victoria Spa. That's right. And... I can remember that. And I can remember it being very physical, and your beautiful body. And it was like you were the dancer in Victoria Spa. So, you stuck in my mind. But obviously, you, I mean, so I remember it. I don't remember. I'm sorry. That's fine. I think dancers punish their bodies. They all seem to smoke, and they all seem to take loads of drugs... and certainly Douglas, I think, lived life to the full, and is very honest about that. I moved in drug circles mainly when I was a teenager. And most of the men in those circles were heterosexual. So, I'd have crushes on them, but they'd stick needles in my arm but that's all they'd stick into me. I went to Sydney and became a heroin addict, and I came back to New Zealand quite broken, and met Malcom then. Was it love at first sight? Mmm. Malcom, not only pulled me out of using heroin, he asked me a question, "Is there anything in your life that you've ever wanted to do?" And I could remember that the only thing I'd ever loved was dancing. I also fell in love, and that changed everything. He said, did I want to come home with him. I'd been back to people's places, but I'd never stayed the night and Ian clearly wanted me to stay the night. He lit loads of candles, cliché though that is. I was in love. We did everything together, and he took me to a gay club, and that was a revelation. ♪ Oh, baby ♪ ♪ My heart is full of love and desire for you ♪ ♪ Now come on down and do what you've got to do ♪ ♪ You started this fire down in my soul ♪ ♪ Now can't you see it's burning out of control ♪ I was happy, I was so happy. And I did the whole thing. I came out, which shocked everybody at the time. ♪ Good loving can set me free ♪ Did you actually come out at any point, is that...? Yeah, oh God. Yeah. I wrote this awful... story about Christ's crucifixion where I kind of compared myself coming out to Christ, and honestly... I mean, it's embarrassing now. But it felt, I mean, the agony of coming out at that time was, was terrible. My parents persuaded me that I should go and see a psychiatrist, because in those days it was considered a disease. So, I went and saw a psychiatrist, and he wanted to put me on some experimental drug therapy, which I think was a form of LSD. I should have tried it. I would have been, yeah, around twenty-nine, thirty, that I would have, "come out." I think I finally blurted it out, I think it was, like, the night before we got married. And I said, "Oh by the way..." I mean, despite how fraught it might have been, or how difficult, or the lack of understanding, or what we were honest or not honest about, that urge to follow God, you know, to do that thing that you think is just the right thing to do so strongly, you kind of go against all logic. Because I was in love, I had the strength to come out. I didn't care what people thought, because I just wanted, you know, I was, I was happy. The problem was, in some ways, I'd never experienced anything like this before, and I think I smothered our relationship. After about six months, Ian said, look, he wanted to break up. And I didn't understand the reasons, and I was heartbroken. I decided it was time to see the world and go on an adventure. I got to London beginning of 1979. I got a job in a restaurant washing dishes and started to explore this huge city. It was the tail end of punk. I went to clubs, and saw amazing acts. Punk rock was a huge thing and that absolutely saved my life because it became glamorous to be different, basically. So, instead of people chasing me round going, "Poof, poof, poof." They chased me around going, "Punk, punk, punk." And then started coming in and asking if they could join in my group. Soho was the red-light district of London. It was a fantastically exciting world. I'd read about all the characters in books. I'd read Gean Genet; I'd read William Burroughs. You know, they'd written about drag queens, they'd written about gangsters, they'd written about rent boys, and, you know, I was suddenly at the heart of it. ♪ Tonight, tonight ♪ ♪ It's right tonight ♪ Nowadays, the sex industry is mostly online. Recently, I thought I'd try paying for an escort, especially when I saw a porn model advertising his services. Before our interview, I realized I didn't know anything about Ben. First off, Ben, and I, I'm assuming Ben is your real name. Yes. Which, which do you enjoy more, escorting or porn? Um, probably escorting, definitely. So, porn is, porn has its moments. I think promotion in porn is fun, but when you're actually filming it, it can be a nightmare. How hard to you think it is to get a group of gorgeous people in a room and fuck? And you'd be surprised. As I said, my list is mainly chronological, but I want to talk to Ben at this point in the story, because my first paid job in films was also in the porn industry. When I got to England I had no money, I was trying to get into films, and I was sort of editing just round the corner here in Soho. I wandered into a gay sex cinema that was just downstairs, and I got talking to the owner. He used to be tipped off by the Police - when there was a raid. - Okay. And in those days, they weren't allowed to show anybody coming. So, he used to pay me to cut out all the cum shots before a raid. Then he'd bring them all up, and I'd put them all back. Eventually, he sort of said, "Look, do you want to work the weekends?" So, I ended up working in a gay sex shop in Soho. There was a little front bit with magazines. People would come in, they'd look at the magazines and mostly they'd pay, you know, five pounds, and they'd go out the back. And out the back, there were 20-odd seats, a little projection booth. It was packed, thirty, forty people crammed into this little place. And it was mainly an excuse to have sex. Do you think gay men are too fixated on sex? Ah yeah, definitely. I don't think sex is the most important thing though. What is the most important thing, then? Um, well, having someone that you care about or having, you know, ah, the people around you in your life, you know what I mean? Good friends, um, you know, your friends, or like your family. I mean, there were all sorts of crazy people that came in. There were, sort of, mayors that would draw up in their chauffeur-driven limousines, there were arms dealers from abroad, there were lawyers, there were gardeners, doctors, accountants... The accountant, the reason he's on the list, is he had an enormous dick. It's funny because I've met several accountants, and they all seem to have enormous dicks. I don't know why. And the other thing is, I stayed the night with him, and the next morning, I remember it was the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana. We started watching the wedding, and got distracted and ended up having sex while they were, the wedding was going on in the background. So, it was quite a memorable scene. I actually managed to get a bit closer to some Royal action shortly after this. He told me, when I asked what he did for a living, that he was a senior member of the Royal Household. I sort of fancied him, but when he suggested that I could come back and stay the night at his place at Buckingham Palace, I thought, this is a chance I, I've, I've got to say yes to. So, I was terribly excited. Sadly, it was a bit of a letdown, because we went into this little tiny side gate, and he had a small room with a single bed. I did stay the night, and I can remember, in the morning, we had a cup of tea, and he had a mismatched cup and saucer, which I thought was somehow totally wrong for Buckingham Palace. ♪ The air was thick with a smell of oppression ♪ ♪ The military joined with angry position ♪ ♪ The tension tight with the strain of repression ♪ ♪ Young blood boiling hot with aggression ♪ ♪ Jah war ♪ There was a skinhead I remember called Joe, Joe the skinhead. I met him in this ridiculous little custom that used to exist. Basically, in trains they had those little private carriages. - Do you remember those...? - Oh, where the doors open and, yeah, yeah. And people literally try and have sex between stations. And this guy Joe, who was a very sexy skinhead, used to, sort of, ride round the trains all day long just, you know, it was completely bizarre but, um... I didn't meet Joe. Wish I had met Joe, actually. Joe, Joe sound great. ♪ Jah war ♪ ♪ Fighting fighting ♪ - ♪ Jah war ♪ - ♪ Too close frightening ♪ As the 80s wore on, I found I was meeting more and more gay skinheads. I was part of that. I mean, I loved it. I mean, I shaved my hair off as quickly as I could. Ah, you know, Bomber Jacket, 501s, Doc Martens, piercings, I loved it. It was a fantastic image; I was a complicated image. Because it wasn't too long after the whole National Front kind of revival, and there was definitely a politics lying underneath it, yeah. There was a subversion going on of a, of a, of a neo fascist image. He came in, he was about eighteen, very good looking, and in fact, had posed as a model for some of the magazines that we sold in the shop. And when he came in, I recognized him, and thought, "Wow. You've been in one of those magazines." And what was even nicer was he came back with me. As part of this, I went back to try and find the magazine where he'd appeared. This is a box of magazines from the 70s, which have been pandered away, and to be quite honest with you, the time has come when they've got to go. Okay. I don't really want to put them into the waste paper bins. I'm sure the waste paper bin sorters will have a bit of fun with them, but I'd rather not. The guy, Ian, my friend, was actually, I think he was in the Zipper Magazine. Well, there was nothing in the magazine that you could object to, I mean, young men in very large, voluminous, ah, swimming trunks, that you couldn't have seen the outline of a cock even if you had wanted to. It just wasn't there. I didn't find the magazine with Ian in it. But it did give me some free porn. And the search gave me a chance to meet one of the men at the heart of gay publishing. This magazine? That was the one? So, that's the actual very first Him magazine? - It is. And that was the start of the real commercial side of gay magazines. We got distribution through W.H. Smith's after a huge battle. We were printing at that time sixteen thousand eight hundred copies each month. On issue Number 8, the police took the whole lot from the printers. Why? It had an article about a masseur who was a rent boy. So, this is not even for a picture they seized it? No. The magazine had pictures in it. Right. And, and, ah... But at the time you couldn't put nude pictures in. At one stage in 1976, we were actually raided every single week. Did you get angry about it? I think it was more a driver in so much as, "You can't do this." What right have you got to come to seize magazines 'cause they're gay? The cinema club was also raided lots of times. When the owner was arrested, I actually ended up running the cinema club for a bit, and paying protection money to the local mafia. Once a week, I would meet this gangster character in a, another Soho pub. We literally went into the toilet and I would hand him a brown envelope with five hundred pounds, a thousand pounds. Suddenly I would be with all these characters that looked as if they'd stepped out of some crazy gangster movie. There was a genuinely dark side to my time at the cinema club. The real thing that bought it home to me was the death of one of the rent boys that I got to know. He used to come into the shop quite regularly, he would bring his punters in, do them out the back. We had a bit of a play one time... Sadly, he stopped coming to the club. And, then, a few years later, ah, I was reading a book about the murderer Dennis Neilson, and discovered that he was one of the victims. Dennis Neilson killed sixteen young gay men. Nobody noticed a serial killer was at work. And in fact, the only way that he was eventually discovered was the fact his drains were blocked with body parts. How can sixteen people just disappear? Not even a missing person's report. I'd like to think that couldn't happen today. I don't know. I stopped working in the sex shop when I got work as a real film editor and I started to explore places outside London. One night, I went up to a club in Birmingham. I looked at John, and I guess it was just love at first sight. John, we'd only met three or four times, and he'd come down to London. And suddenly I said, "Look, come and live with me." He wasn't sure, and he came down just to sort of wander round for a day to think about it. And I didn't know he was coming down to London. I got on the Underground, and he was sat opposite me. He just said that was obviously fate. The following week, we got a little flat together. For the first time, I was in a domestic environment. I, I think I went and bought recipe books and tried to cook dinners and things like that. How did you actually meet your partner? He was on a tube train and I was on a tube train, and we, I followed him home. Wow. My father, one morning said to me, "Are you mixed in with this homosexuality lark?", and I said, "Yes." And he said, "Well, why?" And I said, "Well, that was the way I was born." And that was the end of it. But my father, he always said about my partner, Colin... "You got a good one there, mate. Don't you screw it up." For the first few months, it was absolute bliss and wonderful, and we were in love. And then the difficult question of monogamy reared its head. Hampstead Heath was literally on our doorstep, and Hempstead Heath is probably the most famous cruising ground in the United Kingdom. Monogamy... Yeah. Do you think any gay gay people can be monogamous? Um, they can, but generally, I think it's more healthier in a relationship, because generally I think, like, guys are guys, and lots of guys have trouble keeping it in their pants. So, I think it's best to be open about it. What really made me come to London was because I discovered the park. So, that became my social life a little bit, - but it also became my sexual adventure land. - Yeah. These kind of cruising spaces, you just go down to what you really feel. Eventually John confessed that he'd been up on the Heath, and I was hurt and upset. I decided, well, if he's going to do that, then I should. And I went up and met a guy there. He was a little short guy, hence Little John. It turned out he was having a party that weekend. And I told John about it, and I was honest. And I said how we'd met, and I suggested that maybe we should go to this party together. We met lots of friends, we had a really good time. It somehow made the infidelities less painful, and it just somehow led us into a much more relaxed attitude to the whole idea of an open relationship. If you meet a guy, do you expect it be monogamous? The whole idea of monogamy, that's based on that heterosexual marriage model that you partner in this way, and this is the purpose of the relationship... to do that. Whereas, you know, there's this incredible liberty and freedom and exemption as a gay man and in gay relationships to have, like, why do we have to model that? It's not relevant. John had met Richard on Hampstead Heath. And became a good friend of both of ours. Richard was from the North of England. He'd grown up in a mining town, and he'd left school when he was quite young, and he joined the Navy. And he was very much a Navy boy, you know, God, Queen and Country. Except for this one slight problem was that he was gay. There was this organization called the SIB that was specifically, ah, targeted gay people, ah, in the Navy. And if they admitted being gay or if they were caught doing gay things, whatever they are, they were kicked out. It was like an internal police force. - Is that right? - Yes. Because you were still in the Navy when we met, - weren't you? - Yes, yes. Yeah. And I remember all that and... I just couldn't take the whole Navy thing seriously really. Well, I, I remember actually, one of the first times I met you, Paul, you referred to my uniform as my costume. And all these years later I've not forgotten that, that comment. And I, I was amazed at how paranoid you were. Yes, because you never knew when the SIB would come knocking at your door, basically. Yeah, I mean, that people were thrown out, - weren't they? - Yes, yeah. All the time. Overnight they lost their friends, they were outed to their families, they lost their income, and very often they were halfway through a three-year training, and they were just thrown out unceremoniously. Pretty brutal. I was cruising one night on Clapham Common in the 80s, and I remember watching this man, he must have been about seventy-five, even eighty, trying to run across Clapham Common. This gay old man, chased by a Police van that was hunting him for sport. I'd never been that involved with the growing gay rights movement, but when Channel Four launched in 1982, I saw an opportunity to make a program for gay people, and plunged naively into the world of gay politics. This was the, ah, headline that I saw on the front page of the Daily Mail. An MP had demanded, as a result of our little program, that Channel 4 be taken off the air. Anything gay seemed to cause controversy back then. When we were able to publish nude photographs, the angle of the dangle... Explain that to me. Ah, how to put it on film... if a certain appendage was more than a certain degree, it was obscene. The angle of the dangle, is that...? Oh, absolutely. It was very important. And you always cut it off on the way up, not on the way down. I went on to make several other programs for this new channel. And, of course, invariably some of the people I'd met through sex became the subject of these programs. I wandered into a very early leather bar and there was this young guy who had very piercing eyes. He told me that he was a furniture maker. What sort of things do you make? Anything. Anything from torture furniture for prostitutes to really nice beds and tables for people to eat food off of... and sleep in and fuck in. Okay. What, the camera is about to run out of film. And my beds don't creak either while you're fucking. It's probably, as a piece of documentary film making, the thing I am most proud of. I was really enjoying the work, and it was also fun to live with John. We went down to New Zealand to visit the folks. On the way back, we stopped at San Francisco. It was a revelation. I remember arriving in San Francisco, and this was, like, the early 80s. I went to a place called Castro, which was a gay ghetto, and it, it blew my mind in the sense that I'd never seen a place where everything was gay. The signs, the bars, the coffee houses, you know, the bank, the people behind the counter were gay. Would you like the idea of a gay ghetto? I don't know, if it's a ghetto then it's, ah, I don't know, I feel like that still would have been pretty dangerous. It would've been like a... It, I mean, it wasn't. It was completely, it was... that was the beauty of it. I don't know if I'd want to live in a gay community, like, that it's just gay people, because, ah, I want to, I want to make friends because they are friends, not because they're gay. During the early 80s, London began to develop its own gay ghetto around Soho and Old Compton street. Around this time, John and I moved into a flat in the center of town. One afternoon, a tourist with blue shorts followed me home, and we ended up having sex. We had a spare bed downstairs, and I said, "Look, I live with a partner upstairs, but you are welcome to stay here." So, I went upstairs and John had heard the doorbell, and wanted to know who it was. To which John said, "Well, is he cute?" and I said, "Yes. Do you want to go down to check him out?" To which John did. And he came back about an hour later and said, "Yes, he was very cute." And I think that was the point at which we decided that the open relationship was no threat to our friendship and love. He said he was twenty-four, he had a huge cock, and... not sure whether I really believed this, but I said, "Come over." Then he said, "Look. I've just got one thing that I should warn you about." He said, "Um, I like wearing diapers." Sure enough, he had an adult pair of diapers. Though, when he brought out a large dummy, I decided perhaps this wasn't for me. Near where we lived, I discovered a little afternoon bar, called the Market Tavern. One of the DJs who played there was just stunningly good looking. In reality, I think, the only reason he wanted to talk to me is because I was suddenly in television. When he suggested going back to his place, I leapt at the chance. Very sadly, about two years later, he became ill and died. Scientists at the national centers for disease control released the results of a study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic of a rare form of cancer. At the time, in Manhattan, the AIDS virus, it was a whisper rather than a resounding, kind of, tidal wave that it became. And I ignored that whisper and, yeah, went wild really. I was celibate at that point because nobody knew, nobody knew whether even kissing was a problem, you know. So, because of that, you know, just, I just... kept it in my pants, basically. By the mid 80s, the idea of safe sex, the use of condoms, was absolutely starting to take off. And I got involved, and had done some safe sex adverts, and certainly started to practice safe sex. I came out into a world of condoms and fear, you know. That was my reality. I was terrified of being fucked for years. But I think a lot of us were. We came out utterly terrified that we were gonna get ill, that we were gonna be infected, that we were gonna infect others. There was a little bar that I went into in Charing Cross. I'd been there for an hour and saw a guy looking at me, and he was very cute-looking. I asked him, did he want to come back with me? He said, "I'd love to, but just been told I'm HIV positive." He expected me just to walk away, and I didn't. I said, "Look, it's obviously got to be safe but I'd love you to come back." I don't really remember the sex. I remember him crying, that's it. He just wanted to be hugged. His parents didn't know he was gay, none of his friends knew he was gay. He had just been told he had, at most, a year to live, and at twenty-two, that's not an easy thing to come to terms with. You said you were diagnosed as HIV positive in 19...? 1990, February 1990. What did Malcom say? His main thing was that, he wanted to die before I died. He didn't want to live when I, while I was, if I wasn't alive. And they gave me eighteen months to live at that time. I had to wear black quite a lot. There were a lot of funerals, a lot of funerals. And it was all down to us naughty gay people. Yeah. And that fed into prejudice, I mean, I remember some of the Daily Mail and the Sun headlines. Yes. Oh, yeah. Which actually suggested that perhaps an island off the coast of England should be set up for gay people to be put on. Certainly there was a lot of comment in so much as we should all be in prison or sent away and packed off onto a ship in the middle of the Atlantic. Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay. All of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life, yes, cheated. Margaret Thatcher had introduced Clause 28 in 1987. Clause 28 banned any talk of homosexuality in any educational environment. It was a very negative piece of legislation. The outrage that people felt, that here we were in the middle of this atrocious epidemic, and instead of our government treating us with compassion, it chose that moment to attack. And I think that pushed people out of their comfort zones and onto the streets. Clause 28 was one of the many issues that caused huge upheavals in Britain during Thatcher's time. The public hatred towards gays and lesbians was really at its zenith. What were you doing personally at this point? I left uni in '88. Most of my friends went into the city or into law or into very, very, very well paid jobs. And I went and worked in a brewery. I kicked around for about a year, and then, ah, actually got a job on a gay paper in London, Capital Gay. I think this is when I met you through the paper. - It was through, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - I think I was still. Capital Gay. And it was brilliant, you know. I wanted to be a journalist. I'd wanted to be a journalist since I was a kid. And I was very out and very politicized, and it just allowed me to put the two things together. I think in the past, there was more ability that if we felt something very strongly, we could have more influence. I met Gary around the late '80s, before he was with his partner Norman. When I came out in, you know, the '70s, it felt like there was a possibility, you know, through gay liberation, of having an alternative lifestyle and culture. If you're gay and you know it, clap your hands. I remember taking part in a program about gay men in Newcastle, and it was like we were a separate species. You really did expect Attenborough to come out and, sort of, say... The city at night, a time when some people feel free at last from the harsh daylight realities of their lives. The only time when they can reveal their true selves. They are homosexual. He asked me whether I was gay, and I said, "Yes." I didn't see any point in hiding it. Norman and Gary have quietened down a little bit nowadays. They still love a good night out, though perhaps not for three days in a row. Now, I think, how on earth did I fit the time in to do that. Go out on a Thursday night, and then I used to work on a Friday and a Saturday. And I think, well, how the hell did I do that and still have a life? You tell me, Gary. That is something I just need... I've had, I've had a ball. I've had a ball. When we had the old bar systems and all those, it was much more underground, and so on, - there was much more a mixture of society. - Yeah. So, it'd be more likely that a guy who was just an ordinary council job would meet somebody who was into opera. I met all sorts. French Steve, a Hungarian guy who was a Philosophy Student, Vinnie who was a singer. And Graham who was an actor and became a successful theater director. From the age of eight, I knew I wanted to go into the theater. I was the Artful Dodger in Oliver for the local amateur theater company. There weren't many role models for gay people around. We had Larry Grayson and we had John Inman. We had very camp and affected gay men. I woke up this morning and I felt as limp as a Vicar's handshake. I remember my stepfather and my, and my mother sitting watching the television and then saying how disgusting gay men were when it came on to the television. My gay self has been very tricky because I was sexually abused for many years, since age from fourteen. Stepfather was abusive, and was never able to tell my mother about it. So, I came into a world of feeling very ashamed of who I was. The man who was abusing me telling me it was disgusting; really mixed messages. So, by the time I'd gone to drama school, I was a real bag of confusion. But, a year into that, I met a very lovely man who has become a very successful actor now, um, had my first proper gay relationship. So it was liberating in many ways. But I still carry a sense of shame. For most of my work, I had to really seem to be not to be gay. The reason I started my own shop is because it was made very clear to me very early on in my career that not being a straight man would have not been acceptable within my career. It would have reached a ceiling and that would have been it. Now there would be a lot of people in what I do that would argue with that. But I'm absolutely sure even now that still is the case because I think that despite all of the legal equality we've got, there's still a psychological inequality which still exists. In 1996, combination therapy provided the first real hope for thousands of people living with HIV. Sadly, for many it was too late, work colleagues, people who'd been in my documentaries, the Market DJ, Little John; the list goes on and on. Part of history of the '80s and '90s was very much dealing with people being sick and dying. And... it affected me very deeply. I lost, I lost some very very close friends. Dealing with so much death so quickly was, was very, very difficult. At that point London was on the gay side, was very stiff and uptight, and lots of leather clones and techno music, and back end of disco. And I remember Heaven, one night a week it was allowed to have house music. Then about two in the morning they would open the door between this little side club off Heaven and we'd all kind of go out into the main club. This horrible clash of civilizations, like old gay, new gay. It was, nobody knew quite how to dance with each other. By the mid '90s there were new gay clubs that catered to the rave culture. The scene in London was suddenly famous worldwide. The Canadian used to come over for a weekend of clubbing and then crash at my place before flying back to Canada Monday morning. Another weekend visitor came from Paris, a dancer. Of course, like all dancers, he had a fantastic body. It was a scene that I never got heavily involved in, but a scene that John met a friend, and they started going out clubbing, and it started to put pressure on our relationship. I started to explore other worlds. Derek and Rob were in an S&M relationship. There were lots of games. It was good fun and it was exploring all sorts of interesting things sexually. It was adventurous and certainly different for me. He liked toys, and it was the first person I'd ever met who liked toys. And then the Dublin Boys. They were another threesome, great fun. Until, ah, the age, I was twenty-eight, I was in monogamous relationships that failed, failed, failed, failed, failed. So, when I got to twenty-eight I just, well, fuck this. I'm going to just be promiscuous and enjoy the sex, you know. Was that fun? Oh, my Lord, yes. It was, like another world. I think I'd repressed my sexual feelings because, um, dirty gay promiscuous men, I didn't want to be one of those, you know, oh, no. When I was able to just have sex for the sake of sex, it was liberating. Of course it was liberating. But ideally I would like to be monogamous, but I don't know if that's realistic. At this point, John and I really had started to talk about breaking up. Underneath it all, I think we both still loved each other, but it was clear that we were arguing, and there was tension, and it just wasn't working. So, I shifted out. It was a very low point. Do you want a boyfriend? - Probably. - All right. But love, Cupid has to, shoot his arrow through your heart, and through the other person's heart as well at the same time. If that doesn't happen then... But you have been shot in the heart? Yeah. But not in the way that I, you know, you, you start finding faults in past relationships, and you think, was that really love? Let him go, didn't I? Why did you two break up? God, I was too controlling, ah, kind of insecure, really. We were just too good looking together, ah, Okay. I wanted to get away from it all and decided to go and visit Blackpool. I asked him what he did for a living and he said that he did bare-knuckle fighting, which, of course, is illegal. He suddenly asked, did I want to see some videos of his fights. As the night wore on, he kept insisting to me that he wasn't gay, and then he almost looked at me as if, waiting for me to correct him. It was an evening that made an enormous impression on me. I decided that this could be the start of a film, and I went on to spend the next ten years developing a story around the fighter that I'd met. I missed John terribly, and I still loved him hugely. I guess I was lonely, and I started to experiment with all sorts of crazy things. He messaged me that he had a slave, was I interested? And sure enough, he had this guy with a mask on. He had a thick Russian accent and had bottle of vodka, which he downed half of it through the course of the morning. Most weekends seemed to entail some aspect of experimentation, clubbing, or drugging. I didn't go totally off the rails. Maybe it was the hope of getting back with John that stopped me plunging into some of the darker scenes out there, like the Muscle Man. I started chatting on the phone and I realized we'd met a couple of years earlier. He said, "Oh, I've changed a little since we met." And he had. He'd bulked up, become really muscly. He also lit up a crack cocaine pipe and wanted to be hurt for real. He wanted to be hit, he wanted to be tied up, he wanted to have cigarettes put out on him. He wanted unsafe sex. It was scary. I think we were lucky because it was before the drugs became an inherent part of what, you know, it wasn't chem sex. We'd have a joint, wouldn't we? And that was lovely and even relaxed us. But I'm really glad that I was born when I was, because I think, because I have so much pain, which isn't as bad as it used to be, but I think I'd have really got into terrible drugs and sex and, kind of, got lost along the way. You've said at the time you had a problem with alcohol and drugs. Do you think the hassles you were having over accepting being gay fueled that? Yeah. It wasn't all of it; it was part of it. I ended up committing a crime, and ended up in prison during the Christmas period. And it was probably at my lowest time, you know. Um, drugs were scarce in there, and I was walking around and I was thinking, fuck. Twenty-six-years-old, Paul, big time crook with all these other guys just like me, you know, thinking that this was neat. And I, kind of, knew, just knew that if I didn't get out, it was gonna be this for the rest of my life, really. It was one of our video afternoons. We all got our cushions and our bags, and started lying down, watching these educational videos on addiction and um, they had these three short stories that were twenty minutes each, and in the middle, the middle story was called, ah, "Gay, Proud and Sober." And we were lying down, watching. And just before the "Gay, Proud and Sober" came on, one of the men got up and fast-forwarded it. "Wait until the next short movie. We're not watching this 'Gay, Proud and Sober' thing." And we all knew it was the next one. And I was fuming. And I just got up, and I rewound the movie and played it, and it just went silent. Went silent and ah, the next day in group, I just told them. I just told the group, and... I think the conversation has shifted a little bit. It's like, "We know you're gay, we don't care that you're gay, shut up about it." Um, so, it's like, you know, like, there's those, there's these really weird messages that are still being sent these days that's just still perpetuating that idea that we can exist, but not be seen or heard. Being visible to people is actually, I think, a really, like, large part of your identity. and sharing your identity with other people. I am shocked that, on the one hand, you know, amazing changes, I'm also shocked at listening, and I've interviewed some young people, and there are times I'm thinking, hang on a sec. I could have been saying the same thing twenty, thirty years, forty years ago. I'm looked down upon, I'm frowned upon, because I'm something that everyone else doesn't want me to be. I'm still inundated, to be honest, with people, the lowdown, people who seem to be leading double lives. - People who are married. - Yeah. People whose profile says they're straight, and they've only got, like, a picture of, that. And when I asked him, "Why does your profile say you're straight?" And he's like, "I am straight. I just like having sex with men." I'm like, "Yeah right." When I started working on this documentary, I thought, well, I've got to track down some of these people. Panos, opera singer. There can't be many. I knew he was Greek, You came to London, and it was to do, study at, ah... Trinity College of Music, yeah. Classical singing, opera. Now If you were about to ask me about what my experience was from that time, one of my harsh time I had in my life was, it was there. And it was because I was stigmatized as gay. It came from a very close person who was putting me up the first year of my studies. I told her, "This is my boyfriend, this is my life, this is what, who I am." And, she called the college to say that I'm gay. And I was kicked out, evicted from her house, and stayed homeless. When the landlady found out you were gay, she chucked you out? You know, you have rage when they, when they kick you out of who you are, and especially if you have your loved one next to you. Luckily Panos found the college were supportive, and they found him some alternative accommodation. The most happy moment of my life, because at that time, I could fulfill my dream which was to finish my studies. As a new century approached, there was real progress in the struggle for equality. But hatred continued to fuel atrocities, such as the bombing of the Admiral Duncan in 1999, which killed two people. And I continued to meet many people leading double lives. Around this time, I discovered a strange little phenomena, telephone chat lines. This anonymous world was full of closeted men from all over the country. A Cornish fisherman, an Aberdeen oil rig worker, a First Division Footballer from up North, But there are dangers of meeting people off the phone line. One day, he came out of the bathroom with a gun in his hand and put the gun at my head. He was basically robbing me. He was very agitated; he was a totally different person to the person I'd had sex with. He smashed a phone and yelled that, if I call the police, he'd come back and kill me, and left. I did call the police straightaway, I remember the police sergeant asked how I'd met this guy, and I was a little bit hesitant. He just was very clear and said, "Look, we think we know who this person is. We're not making a moral judgement. We just want to catch this guy, because he's done it before, and we want to stop him." I was surprised that the police were so supportive. I remember thinking at the time that things really are changing. I was even offered victim support counseling. In so much as ten years after we were actually raided, I was actually sitting on a committee of the police force actually talking about policing the gay community. When Admiral Duncan was bombed, I was actually invited to come in and talk at Scotland Yard. I actually did a number of talks in local police stations about equality and diversity. I just recently filmed London Pride, and all of the Armed Forces had representatives there, bands marching. Did you ever think you'd see something like this? No. I thought that would be impossible. The thought of military people being open about their sexuality is to me, it's actually incredible, because now they can get on with their jobs and do the things that they love and serve their country without the overhead of having to worry about the SIB or, you know, or the Naval patrol. Clearly there are legal changes that happened, but in terms of those changes having an impact, it was really through the examples of individuals coming out to families, coming out to friends, that really did make the cultural change. I got over John completely. It was very strange. For many nights, I found myself dreaming about him, and then one night those dreams suddenly stopped. Literally the following week, I got a letter out of the blue from John saying how much he missed me. And if you know anything about John, he doesn't even like using a telephone, let alone writing. And he said, "Well, we should meet up for something to eat." And I said, "Definitely." And before too long, John and I were back together. You and John, when I met you, you helped an awful lot, because you were completely comfortable about who you were and about your sexuality in a way that would have been unthinkable for me to be at that time. You made a decision to leave the Navy, Yeah, just because I couldn't stand the stress of it anymore. Richard ended up in Australia after going back to University and doing a science degree. It was a whole new life and he flourished. Now with a PhD, he's a highly-respected research scientist. He also soon met someone special. So suddenly now free to explore being gay, and you... - Yes. - Mmm. How did you find that? Was it fun? It was, it was great fun. And I think it was only six months after I joined the university, I met Kevin, my partner. Things really did change then because, you know, I was able to be myself and form a relationship with somebody that I loved. I knew love had to be part of my film about the fighter, but was struggling to find the other character. One night, I started chatting to this young, very sexy-looking guy whose name was Lee. And he told me that he was a singer in a boy band. ♪ I want it all and I want it right now ♪ Sure enough, about a month later he was on Top of the Pops. ♪ I'm not crying, now I'm climbing ♪ I remember even, he used to ring me up, and he was on tour with a couple of other boy bands... ...and he'd ring me up, and say, "There's all these girls screaming outside my hotel." And I would jokingly suggest that they were wasting their time. It was after meeting Lee, that I suddenly thought the other central character for the fighter film should be somebody who works in the music business. They were mouthy bastards. Well, so they deserved a good kicking then, did they? They kept calling me queer. For fuck's sake, Craig, that's what you are, a queer. Just deal with it. That's it, is it? Deal with it. Got a magic wand, have you? Look, me coming down here don't mean everything is just sorted. Yeah well, carry on like that, and nothing will get sorted. Just want the easy life, don't you? What do you think I should do then? Start putting the same crap up my nose as you. It was picked up by a distributor, and the first screening ever was at little festival, a little gay festival, in Turin. There was a guy who worked in the box office of the festival, and we went back to my little hotel. A fantastic experience of my first film really making the cinema, and it was great to share it with someone. Touring with the film was a great to meet people all over the world. There was the Munich sauna boy, a black man in Seattle, in San Francisco, a dancer, a New York high-flying banker. You travelled, didn't you? I went to the biggest club in Scandinavia, the Scandinavians Leatherman's Club. Great. I thought I was going to get abducted. And it was going away, overseas to Brazil. Then the real fullness, wholeness, whole being, started coming through, and I thought, "Hey. This feels really good." And so I both went off and sought Christian healing to deal with the "homosexual issue" in my life, and then I was also wandering the streets of Amsterdam trying to connect with that. So, both were happening at the same time. Back and forth, bang bang. The television company I was working for opened a Sheffield office and offered me a chance to run it. It was a northern industrial city, and spending a few years here forced me to re-think many of my ideas around sexuality. The fireman, he was straight out of a porn film. He'd tell me about the fires that he put out that day, and he liked being screwed, and then he had to get back to his girlfriend, And then after about the fourth time of him coming round, he suddenly said, would it be possible for him to bring round some lesbian porn? This sexy, sexy fireman liked being screwed while watching lesbian porn. I have no idea where his head was at. I distinctly remember thinking, there's no such thing as bisexuality. I've changed my mind. I hasten to add, and thoroughly enjoyed, thoroughly enjoyed changing my mind. But-but, I can remember... Was that a confession, Paul? Ah, absolutely. I completely and utterly thought, "Right," , "I'm gay. I, you know, I'd never had sex with a woman," freaked out at the whole idea, Met this guy who was married, who kept saying, "I've told my wife all about you and she wants a threesome." And, finally after a long period of time, I thought, this is ridiculous. What am I so scared of, you know? I can truthfully say, I think I was more nervous at that than I have been on anything recently. She knew that I was technically a virgin. And I think we roared with laughter about all of this, and, in a way, that was what made it exciting for her. It was after meeting this couple that I realized sexuality was a much more fluid thing than I've ever imagined, and it was a wonderful bisexual I met in Sheffield who really taught me this, Brian. We'd go clubbing together, and he loved Mozart of all things. We ended up in all sorts of crazy situations, and I remember one weekend Brian came down, and we'd actually just taken an ecstasy pill, and this married couple that we'd seen a couple of times texted us out of the blue saying that they were in a hotel, and they had somebody tied up, did we come and join them? So we did. He was a lovely guy, he was interesting, he was vibrant, and he had some dark demons. He suffered from depression, and... he had been abused as a child, and this had left huge scars. Over the years, he had his ups and downs. He tried to kill himself a couple of times. He eventually got a quite good job, and he ended up with a nice circle of friends in Sheffield. Yeah. He didn't, he killed himself, And it was, it was, it was sad. It was really sad because I'd seen him about a week and a half earlier, and I think the saddest thing is he, and there was, funnily enough, a performance of Mozart's requiem. And I was working really hard, and I was exhausted and I said, "Look I just can't make it but, you know, you go and enjoy it, and we'll meet up in London when you next come down." My memories of Brian are somebody who was vital and wonderful and loving and kind. I tried to track down all sorts of people from the past. I wish I'd been able to find them all. I even tried to resuscitate old phones. Sadly, I've lost touch with a lot of them. But one person I did manage to track down was Janusz from Poland. So the old town, it's... It's, it's actually the young town. Right, okay. Of course, it was destroyed to the ground during the war. It was rebuilt, but in a different way. This old city we can see today, is a little bit artificial. I went with Janusz and one of his friends on a pride march. It was much more reserved than London's march, but still wonderful to see. Obviously, things have changed a lot for gay people in New Zealand and in London. Have they changed much for gay people in Poland? I think, yes. People for sure are more open. Most of them, especially the young people, they are not frightened, scared about talking about their sexuality. You're openly gay? - Yeah, I'm openly gay. - I mean... Your parents, they, they know your gay? Yeah, they, yeah, my parents, my family. Of course they don't accept it, yeah? I'm sorry for that. And that's a bit sad story about my life. And now, I mean, you're are in a relationship, - aren't you? - Yeah. Yeah. We met on Starbucks. That's, yeah, that's kind of romantic story, yeah. How long have you two been together? - Eight years. - Eight years, and that's, you're happy? Yeah. We are happy. It's like the old couple, old marriage couple right now. We've got dogs, so we've got kids actually. - ♪ True love ♪ - ♪ Is what I feel for you ♪ - ♪ True love ♪ - ♪ I need it so bad ♪ ♪ True love ♪ Marriage? Are you married? Yes. Why did you decide to get married? Um, well, we love each other. That's, that was, that was part, part of it. A major, major part of it. Would you ever consider it, if you met the right guy? I've actually got a scrapbook at home with it all planned out. We watched the legalization, you know, when they did it, and we went to the gay bar, and sort of, watched it on TV. And then afterwards you did, you said, you know, "Do you want to get married?" - Do you remember? - Maybe. But it's also about becoming acceptable within the straight society is, you're part of a couple. You become part of a, of a group of people who've made a commitment to each other. So, amongst straight people suddenly you've become almost more acceptable. If you want to get married because you truly love an individual, and you want a symbolic solidification of that love, then that's fine, that's important, you should have the right to do that. But if it's just to, like say, "Hey, we're just like everybody else, we're respectable upper crust society," no, that's bullshit. - ♪ True love ♪ - ♪ Come on now, baby ♪ Colin and I were the first couple in Somerset to contract a civil partnership, and in actual fact, I think we beat Elton John by a couple of seconds. We both felt something had happened, but we couldn't explain what. But the wonderful thing was, the number of people, a small town in Somerset, people come up, and said. "Oh, well done. Oh, I am happy for you." That wouldn't have happened once upon a time. I have a brother and he had bought a property in New Zealand; an old colonial house that he wanted to convert into a Bed and Breakfast. The idea came up that perhaps John, who'd always wanted to live in New Zealand, could go off and give that a go, and see if he liked it. So he headed off to, of all places, Rotorua, this little tourist town, and I was left in London. I wondered if a long-distance relationship could work. How long were you with Colin? Fifty-plus years. What's the secret? We learnt to love one another. And you go from lust, to love, to very good friendship, very deep friendship, and then to pure love. And it's in that last year, and his bed was at the end of my bed, I think it was when you realize what you are going to lose, my God, you didn't want to lose him. You shouldn't ask me questions like this. It was interesting talking to Alan. He'd been with his partner for fifty years. I guess you have to be lucky to find the right person for you. I was lucky that I'd found John, It's a strange relationship we have. But having him there in the background is really important. When he was back in New Zealand and I was in London, and it suddenly, it seemed more important to spend time with him than keep chasing some crazy dreams of making movies or yet more men. So much to my amazement, I headed back to New Zealand. ♪ When I wanna See right through you ♪ ♪ Flyin', highin', Freddy voodoo ♪ ♪ Lucid dreaming Magic wonder ♪ New Zealand had changed completely from the country I'd left thirty-five years ago. There was suddenly a thriving café culture, there were radio stations that played Kiwi music, there was a real sense of its Pacific identity. And of course, rugby, it's still the national religion. But now there was even a gay team. When Gavin and them wanted to make up a team, I came out of retirement just to play in my thirties and it was great because I've always played for heterosexual teams. Things have changed hugely. - Yeah. And nowadays everybody is equal, we have gay marriage. Is it necessary to have something separate? I personally wouldn't be involved in a sporting team if it wasn't for a team like this. Growing up closeted or completely afraid of my sexuality, you have, I guess, this idea of what it means to be a gay man, and it's a world apart from somebody who plays sports, particularly rugby, you know? Like, I guess, I just grew up under the assumption that people like me are not liked by people like that. And I think one of the things that's interesting is, over the years you can roll up in a totally strange place, and get to meet people who live there very rapidly because you're gay, and you are meeting them for sex, socially. But they often do become friends. Steven was someone I met in a sauna years ago. He's now a very good friend. He's a designer, and it's always fun to go round to his place. I arrive, and find him turning a painting from some well-known New Zealand artist into fabric that clothes the body of his friend Alibra Fleur for some exhibition downtown. The joy of being gay for me growing up, is being an outsider, and I embraced a world of outsiders. Oh, yeah. And I still live like, I mean, look around you, I mean, I still live that way now. I'm a fringe of a fringe. I'm not even part of the mainstream gay community, I'm on fringe of that even. But that's what is lovely. I mean, your place, and coming down here, and spending the time down here. - That's what's so lovely. - Yeah. I found New Zealand was now full of people who explored sexuality in their own way. There was a guy at the cruise club who liked wearing overalls while he was having sex. I even made out with gay farmers. He owned a large dairy farm, and would occasionally just come up to the city to meet guys for sex at the cruise club. I kept in touch with him for a while. One of the things that I realized coming back to New Zealand is zero degrees of separation. I went on NZ Dating. This quite sexy young guy, it turns out he was a musician. He said that he was in a relationship, but it was an open relationship. And that was fine, and he said, "Oh, you know, what do you do?" And I said, "I work in a television company, editing and making films." And he said, "Oh, my partner does as well." And of course, it was where I worked. I guess for me the whole thing with an open relationship is, that it only really works if I'm told. Otherwise it's just, sort of, this weird secret, and makes me feel sort of icky. I was certainly very worried about coming into work the next morning. You know, people say they have an open relationship, but it's not always true. And Nathan, he just immediately diffused the situation by saying, "Oh, you met my partner last night." So I thought, phew! I do find there are lots of young gay couples who somehow desperately want to have the sort of, what I call the picket fence. Well, I flatted with a couple of guys like that, and we quite literally had a picket fence and two dogs. And it was very much that sort of clean living, responsible member of society kind of... And that's something that, in all fairness, heterosexuals have to deal with as well. You know, you have girls growing up watching Disney films, so they have this image of the prince and the princess thing. And that's a lot of what I think homosexual culture is now sort of aspiring towards, the sort of rom com conventions. Oh yeah. You see that. You see it. Guys saying, "Oh, where's my prince in shining armor." It's like, "Who the fuck wants a prince in shining armor?" Now when I was eighteen, I did believe that. I did believe that the first person that I would fall in love with, and I did fall in love with a person, you know. The feelings you have at that moment is okay. This is going to last forever. You're just not realistic about these things. It's something that can't be maintained I think, I believe. Simon and I started out open. For the first three years, we had an open relationship. One of the problems was that I just started to get very jealous. Said to Simon, "Hey, I think we should close it off and be monogamous." And he said, "Okay, then.". And that's been the case since. So, it is possible for gay men to have monogamous relationships? It is possible. it is possible. Just about. Maybe a little bit of show and tell at the gym once in a while, but that doesn't count. As long as you don't touch, that's the thing. Then you have the other side, like, where it's just so business like. Okay I'm this, I'm that, I want this, and I want that. Come over here now, satisfy me, there's just no heart in it. Yes, Grinder. Yeah no, I must have, like, uninstalled, reinstalled it, like, at least over a good hundred, maybe a thousand times. Grinder, what do you think of Grinder, out of interest? It's a bit too addictive. He popped up sixty yards away, and it turns out he's shifted into the apartment right next to mine. So, he wants to come round when he's horny, but, ah, he's young, and he wants it too many times. The internet has come along, which has changed the way people meet. The bars have gone. I think we have lost, lost a lot, and we've gained other things. As a consequence of having gained acceptance to some extent, we have, we have lost something. I think the heterosexual community has made us them. They've homogenized us into the way that they do things. The Castro has basically turned into Gay Disneyland. You know, they have fuckin' rainbow crosswalks and all this shit. And you have people coming in and, "Oh. Let's gawk at the gays. Let's go do this and that." But it's, we're, our sacred spaces are being completely eliminated as a result of that. The sense of community spirit and identity that was there twenty, thirty years ago has slowly dissipated. We had a ghetto for a while. Partly that was a defensive posture, and partly it was great fun. But one of the things we're gonna have to get used to in a culture which has decided that we are now all equal is that we possibly can't live in that ghetto anymore. The Stud has actually been one of the oldest gay bars in San Francisco. They just announced they are going to have be closing their doors. You have The Gangway, which was the first gay bar in San Francisco, they have to close their doors this year. The Lexington closed their doors last year. The gay culture in the city really is eroding. Do you think it's important to have separate clubs for gay people to meet in? I don't, I definitely don't think we're at a point in, society where the average straight guy feels comfortable being hit on by a gay guy and is actually comfortable enough to go, "Oh sorry. Not gay, moving on." Do you think it's important to have a place that's just for gay people? Yeah, I do, where gay people can feel free to make out with another dude or hold someone's hand or just dance with someone. I think that's important. Would you not feel free to do that in the places that you might go with your... Oh, no. I would be fine with it, but I've gone on dates with guys, they don't want to show any PDA; not because they are against PDA, but mostly because they're scared that that dude over there is going to beat them up or something. Okay, slow down. Um, my age is now showing. - PDA? - Public display of affection. So, holding hands, kissing, that sort of thing. Talking to Michael and other young people I met on this journey, I feel there's still a need for our own spaces. Sadly, it's not just in San Francisco that the clubs and bars are vanishing. Returning to Soho to film this documentary was a real shock. Many of the clubs and bars were gone, places were just boarded up or being re-developed. That's very, very sad that's gone because we had experiences which the younger gay people just will never have. I was very much for obtaining equal gay rights. I'm not sure I actually wanted to be the same. We are fairly unique, and I mourn the loss of that uniqueness in a way. You wouldn't believe how many young gay kids that don't even know about their gay history. And I say, "Oh, do you need a hanky?" And they go, "Well, what the fuck is that? What is the hanky code? Explain that to me?" And I'm like, "Well, it was a way for our gay ancestors "to talk about what they're into, and express their kinks, and go to a gay bar." You can have a hanky in your back pocket that's red, and you say, "Oh, this guy wants to fist somebody." My countdown has been a sort of historical romp. But, just for fun, I thought, well we've got to have a top 10. I've been racking my brains on who should be in the top 10. So, I don't know, Ben. He is definitely top 10. I mean, he's, like, an escort, and, yeah, he was good at his job. Is there lots of money in it? Oh, yeah, the money is very good. and it's been recession-proof as well. People seem to be spending more on sex. One of the things that people always, sort of, say is, "Oh, you know, what happens when you get old?" And, you know, gay people are so fixated on youth. And I can honestly say that some of the best sex that I've ever had in my life has been with him. Yes. There's many a good tune played on an old fiddle. I have a gardener who is sixty-one, and I think he's, you know. I wouldn't mind. And, remember, to me, he is a chicken. Yeah, there are some really sexy guys on here. Ah, kinky hot. That's hot as hell. Another person on the list is someone I just call "The Writer". We've sort of drifted apart and he's gone off to do other things. But without him, I wouldn't have been able to make some of the films that I've made. One of the things about the top 10, it's actually about the friendship more than just the sex. My times coming to your flat are times that I really cherished. And I felt safe, I felt comfortable, you were a nice man, it was sexy, all those sorts of... This is nice. Keep saying it. Keep saying it. There were two people who came to mind when I thought of you. Panos, and I've never known his name. He lived on the council estate nearby... His name was Paul. Is he being involved in this? I can't track Paul down. I would love too. - He's on the list. - Because he was fascinating. One of the people I just thought would be good to have in the top 10 is someone I just call "The Teacher". He recently married his boyfriend and they've adopted two children, and they love being parents. I didn't think we'd see that kind of change for a hundred years. And it's gone, that, that prejudice, that belief that gays are monsters. What has happened over the last forty years is absolutely fundamental to where we are today. I'm not saying everything is right, I'm not saying we've achieved everything, but we have achieved an enormous amount. The most amazing thing, filming gay pride in London was to see gay Muslims proudly marching with everyone else. My friend Brian would have loved seeing that. I still miss him a lot, And Brian has to be in the top 10. The Club Kid is on here because, in a strange sort of way, he's a bit of a fantasy. Beautiful looking. I mean, you know, he was a like a model. Totally closeted. Playing with this whole S&M strange relationship. We almost met up last time I went over there. But we didn't meet, but perhaps better left as a fantasy. The Club Kid is still an outsider. Maybe that's why the connection was so deep. I literally met this guy in a carpark, I was sixteen/seventeen. He was beautiful. He had long blond hair. He was the beautiful surfer dude that I'd seen, you know, with my mates. What I actually remember is that we hugged afterwards, and it was intense, and somehow it's made that sex meaningful. For me, it was always just about having someone to share everything with, and tell him all the deep dark secrets which, a lot of which don't turn out to be such deep dark secrets when you're with the right person. That's very easy, number one. I mean, you know, it has to be John. Ever since I met John, I never stopped loving him, and it gets stronger. I miss him, perhaps because I don't spend all my time with him. But, I can't imagine life without John. I love him and he loves me. And it's his support that allows me to carry on making films like this. It's been an amazing journey. I've met so many brave, courageous, and honest people. I realize, together, we've been part of a movement that's changed the world. I never thought, as a confused, screwed-up teenager, that, one day, I'd see a gay Bishop, or out politicians, or have such a fantastic boyfriend to share my life with. And though many people still struggle with being gay, I know there's a fantastic world out there. Love is always just around the corner, and in the meantime, there are hundreds of wonderful men to meet. "Nice boy wants another nice boy to go to bed with and do everything else with." "Working Class Hero seeks gay revolution. Butch and dogmatic." "Anybody into last resorts can contact me." "Young cuckoo seeks nest, bring own feathers."
