What's all this? Get with it! It's not our choice to lay around like this. It's the coach he insists we take it easy. Maybe he thinks it's pointless to train you. Get up, Haruo. Lunch, boys. Masako's special feast. Where's Tanaka? He snuck earlier. I don't want to be a burden. I need to train. Remember once I said power doesn't always win in sumo. But bulk is a definite factor. A kilo in weight is a kilo in strength. That's sumo. I know you all didn't want to get fat. So I brought you here. It's cool, with clean air all you can possibly eat and no training. You'll soon put on 5-6 kg. Earlier you were over-training. Relax and build your strength. It's not good to over-train. Everyone's depressed to see Hokuto guys training. The training in Tokyo seems wasted. We were just getting confident. I want to be strong. You're like dead fish! No more food here for you boys. It was delicious. You're all out of condition. You need competition? The Hokuto team are here. Are you kidding? No, I'm not. You've built your strength up. Now get confident. You're enthusiastic. It doesn't become you. Shut up. I'm frightened. You're keen. Here they come. Hokuto refused my offer. They don't like your attitude. So I asked the local schoolboy's club. Damn Hokuto! Train with the kids. This is pathetic. Regard us with favor! Shall we start with Smiley? Come together! Magic. It wasn't magic. When you pushed, you put the strain on your legs. You lifted your leg. And he used his right hand on your left leg and your momentum to flip you over. What was that technique? Inside leg-trip. Power doesn't always win in sumo. Remember that, Smiley. As Jean Cocteau said The balance in sumo is miraculous. In sumo upsetting your opponents balance is all. Right, Tanaka. Shuhei. Damn it! Aoki. Yoshiwara American Cheergirls. Even kids frighten him. Haruo. A win! Once more! What's with him? I'm sorry. Are you alright? He's crazy! Haruo, come here. Your spirit is admirable. But your power doesn't match your spirit. Do as I tell you. I did it. The Tricky Cat. Startle him with a sharp clap. They always flinch. Even a grand champion lost when someone used it on him. What was that? Special technique. He combined it with a head attack. That's my speciality. Along with my fabled inside leg-trip. Don't lift your legs. Remember the basics and you'll win. Don't go easy because they're kids. You're scared of boys? Take these off and you won't be. Close your eyes. Grab his sash! Lower your head. Don't try to throw him. You'll lose your balance. He did it! He did it! Look at the kid-killer champs gloating. They could win the little boy's league. They're just bullies. This is a ''comeback?'' Give sumo some honor! What the hell! Stop it - please! Don't insult sumo! One month to the tournament. Your hell begins today. But don't be afraid. You have the will to win. Together we'll restore the honor of Kyoritsu sumo. When pushed - push! Pulled - push! Sumo is all pushing. Don't lift your legs! Slide! Don't look away. Close your eyes instead. East Japan Student's Sumo Tournament What's with the mawashi? A present from the TV station. But say they're from the old boys. Sorry about the flashy mawashi. Any color is allowable. Whose idea? Skinny. The director. Oh, him. What's with the mawashi? Shame upon shame. Hello everyone. A pretty little bum. There's no problem with the colored mawashi. But Smiley, the tights have to go. No exceptions for foreign customs. Would you mind? I can't do it. Why not? From the east Honjitsu Medical University.

From the east, Tadokoro. From the west, Yamamoto. Go, go, Haruo! Why is Haruo first up? He's enthusiastic. I don't know why but lately he's been very agitated. West wins! A win by leg-sweep. Yamamoto of the west by a leg-sweep. Do it, Tanaka! Do your best! Go, go, Tanaka! A win! He stepped out! Step out! A win to the west. Unintentional step-out. That's great.

Not the shits again! A win! He did it! His first win! Aoki did it! Bow! West wins. Collapse in mid-fight. Hopeless till the very end! From the east, Kurataka. From the west, Yamamoto. Finish them off! Go back! Calm down! A tactic? Fortitude! Perseverance! Persevere! He won! West wins. We won? Did we? So what! The 40th, East Japan Student's Sumo Tournament Third division has been won by the Kyoritsu University Sumo Club! How's Haruo? The break is not so bad but he's very upset. They'll keep him in overnight. So there goes tomorrow's contest. Tomorrow? Divisional promotion bouts. Winners of the 3rd Division get a chance to advance to the 2nd Division. Yes, that's right. I'll refuse the offer. Shuhei sprained his ankle. Haruo's arm is broken. They'll field 7 men. Three is not a majority. Impossible to win. I'll fight! You can't, you're a woman. I want revenge for Haruo. But women aren't even allowed in the ring. It's not even funny. I can enter. I'm not kidding, I'm serious! Alongside you all. In place of Haruo! Please, let me. Alright. She'll have to go naked. So what? She's a club member, too. I'll join in, too. You don't mind? Good, that makes six. It may bring shame on you but humor us. You're the coach. It's your decision. Are you serious? If they know you're a woman, you'll be barred. You'll be naked except for a sash. I'll fight. win, win! Daitoa will win! If we fall to 3rd Division we'll never get back up! They're on a run. Don't let them fool you. If you let these wimps beat ya, I'll kill ya! Fight to the death! What's wrong? Where's Masako? She was gone this morning. And Kawamura? Same thing. From the east, Nogami. From the west, Mamiya. Bow. Masako ! (female name) I'm so sorry. Masao ! (male name) Masao ! We won't fail! From the east, Kitahara. From the west, Smiley. Damnit! From the east, Higashiyama. From the west, Tanaka. Stop that! Freedom of religion! Belly him out! A win! God, oh god, I won. You won! All by yourself! Leave the rest to me. A win! He did an inside leg trip! Diarrhea or not, a win's a win! Show some spirit! He's strong. Far stronger than you. So that's your opening. He expects to win. He'll try for a slap-down. He won't want to get in close. Hang on to him and don't let go. I didn't want to lecture you. But you have a real chance. Under no circumstances let go of his sash. Anyway, I'm satisfied to have come this far. The thing is, will you be satisfied? From the east, Nakada. From the west, Yamamoto. Do your best. Bow. The players are pink giants. As unique as the frescoes from a famous cathedral They come together in equilibrium, their legs intertwined their fingers grasping each other's sash. And the fringe standing erect. Muscles flexing. Legs rooted to the earth. Blood coursing through their veins. And the ring is all a pastel of pink. A win! Thank you, Smiley. I'll be back in two years. Thanks for the Japanese spirit. You're wrong, Smiley. It's one for all and all for one. I'll see you two in London. Masako's dad is in London. She's going there soon. She asked me to go, too. I've always wanted to study abroad. Masako Mamiya. Farewell, Aoki. Let's toast. Good work, Aoki. By the way, Tanaka will turn professional. I made the introduction. We're sorry to lose him for next year. In the last fight God spoke to me. This is only way for you. Your cheers made me so happy. I'm so glad I started sumo. ''Tomio Aoki.'' May I ask a question? Did you really ask to fight Hokuto at summer training? I just wondered. Maybe you planned those kids all along. I didn't plan the all-out brawl. I knew it! I thought Haruo and Tanaka would stay on. Next year we start from zero again. ''Shuhei Yamamoto.'' What are you doing? I'm considering staying another year. I don't want the club to finish. And your job? No more easy roads for me. Will you teach me stamping? Finally I get to stamp my feet.
