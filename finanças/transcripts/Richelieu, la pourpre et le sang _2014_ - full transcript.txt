Richelieu: Glory and Blood Madame! Give back the handkerchief, sir. I'll do no such thing. If you are an honorable man, give me that handkerchief. My honor is at the point of my sword, sir. Removing your sword in front of Cardinal de Richelieu's palace is bold! Don't you know duels are punished by death? Where are you from? I cannot reply to your mockery. The cardinal waits for me. But I will satisfy you and give the disputed object to the only person with any claim to it. Forgive my boldness, Madame. It seems I'm forbidden to keep this. I'm devastated. To whom do I owe the honor? Henri d'Effiat, Marquis of Cinq-Mars. At your service, Madame. I'll remember that. And I will not forget you. To the Louvre! Tell me, friend, the name of that lady? Marie de Gonzague, sir. Duchess of Nevers. What do I hear, Henri? You took out your sword? Don't you know that dueling is now a crime against the king? Forgive me, your Eminence. A lady's honor was at stake. "A lady's honor," especially this duchess's, is not worth losing your life. I don't want nobles killing each other over trifles. My edicts apply to everyone. More illustrious names than yours have paid dearly for such acts. I won't forget, your Eminence. Here is a letter from my mother. I don't need to read it. I can refuse nothing to the son of my old friend, the late Marshal d'Effiat. Your father was of great service to the state. I expect you to follow the same path. That is all I desire, your Eminence. Fargeau, write a note recommending Mr. de Cinq-Mars to Mr. de Tréville. You'll be suited to the musketeers. I know you're brave and a fine swordsman. Go prove yourself. You know my affection for you. Don't disappoint me! I'm at your service, your Eminence. That young man will turn heads. I'm counting on it. Why the musketeers instead of your own guards? I have my reasons. Let's get back to business. Despite the measures we have taken, the queen continues to inform her brother, King of Spain, of all the court's goings-on. I also suspect her of plotting with Gaston d'Orléans and trying to harm me personally. The queen will be furious, I couldn't convince the cardinal. How much longer will she be locked up in the Louvre? He won't forgive her letters to Madrid. Who denounced her? Does the cardinal have a spy? He wouldn't dare. Open your eyes. His Eminence will do anything to protect his interests. Damned cardinal! I'll be avenged. He defies me, but one day he'll beg me for mercy. Then I will crush him. Your words are unwise. Mr. de Thou is right, your Majesty. Your words may be repeated. I know it all too well. I'm surrounded by spies trying to ruin me. They must be uncovered. Whoever they are! Let them go tell this false Christian that his guile makes me sick. I'm the daughter and sister of kings, and queen of France! He will pay for forgetting it. Well, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars... Show what you can do. Monsieur de Chambord. He won't last 2 minutes. Touché, Monsieur! Monsieur de Beaumont! Touché, Monsieur! Our honor is at stake. Who is this young officer fighting off an army? The Cardinal's protégé. Marquis of Cinq-Mars. Touché! You impressed Mademoiselle de Hautefort, the King's mistress. Congratulations, sir. With your sword, the King is very well-guarded. With your beauty, Madame, his Majesty is very well-loved. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again. I share your hope, Madame. To the King, musketeers. I'll see you later, Mademoiselle. Come, your Eminence. I'm late, I know. Our prey escaped, but I didn't want to give up. Your Majesty. 3 hours of hunting for nothing. That beast was clever. Maybe it knew we were coming. I must speak to you before the council. New trouble has broken out in Berry, Champagne, and Poitou. The cities are rebelling against our intendants, the peasants are stirred up. In Paris, attempts on my life are rumored. This isn't new. You are easy to hate. I only govern, but France is not an easy child. It rebels against each edict and rejects reform. By God! That isn't new either. Govern, my dear minister. You have my trust. Your enemies are my enemies. Protect yourself as needed. Haven't I given you guards? Yes, Sire. Not to mention the spies you have all over France and Navarre. Take off this vest, La Chesnaie! It's too tight. Don't give me these garish colors. You know I like moderation. I'm worried by the loss of Mr. de Comons, my dresser. He was so wise. Who at the court can take on this duty? The Marquis de Cinq-Mars, Sire. Henri d'Effiat has taste and wit. Is he related to the Marshal d'Effiat who served us so well? He's his son, your Majesty. Ready to serve you like his father. Really? Well, let's see! As always, I trust your good feelings for me. Places, gentlemen. The King arrives. Henri! Henri, come. Let me introduce you to his Majesty. Let me introduce you to the young man I spoke of. Henri d'Effiat, Marquis de Cinq-Mars. Stand up, Monsieur. Glad to meet the son of our friend the Marshal. His memory is dear. We owe him a great deal. I owe him just as much. And I'll serve you as eagerly, if you'll give me the chance. We'll give it to you. Certainly. I like your idea, your Eminence. This young marquis speaks openly and honestly. Congratulations, your Majesty. Your decisions at the council were very wise. Isn't he a bit young for this position? On the contrary, Sire. You need new blood. He's a proud horseman with whom I'll enjoy hunting. One more thing, Sire, if you'll allow. Well? I'm worried about your brother's intentions. My spies tell me he's in Paris although we banned him from the city. You won't deny that Gaston d'Orléans plots against us? My brother is a scatterbrain who wants the throne. But who cares, since your spies watch him? There's way to crush his claim to the throne. And what is that? Give an heir to France. It's not for lack of trying. Can I help it if the queen is not fertile soil? And I've lost interest in trying. Your Highness! You're late. Well! Will the cardinal see his mistress tonight? She told me so. Marion De Lorme will receive no one else. His Eminence will use a carriage with no crest or escort. His discretion will be his ruin. The cardinal is yours. If your assassins are successful, your fortune is made. He's a dead man, your Highness. Well, Madame! What news? Good news. The storm washed out the road. The king will spend the night at the Louvre. His Majesty will share the queen's bed. Thank heaven and pray that we'll soon have an heir. What else? The king was in a very good mood about his new dresser. A certain Marquis de Cinq-Mars that no one's heard of. You'll hear of him soon. Did you see the Spanish ambassador with the queen recently? The Marquis de Mirabel came to see her yesterday at nightfall. I brought him to her study. They stayed there for almost an hour. I checked this morning. The letters that his Majesty had written to his brother weren't there. Thank you for your precious aid. Go back to the Louvre and I'll take care of your interests as you take care of mine. - All is ready, your Eminence. - Perfect. Take them alive. So they tell us everything they know. Don't kill him! No! I wanted him alive! I want prisoners! No! Don't kill him! Don't kill him! Don't kill him! Viva Espana! The Devil take it! I wanted them alive! I needed them to name Gaston d'Orléans and his co-conspirators. How can I prove his betrayal to the king? How can I know if the queen was part of this plot? Where can they be? We should've already heard. Calm down, your Highness. You'll make me doubt you. Do you know what I found out? The king is sleeping with the queen tonight. Who cares! He won't impregnate her after 22 years of childlessness. Flee, it failed. - Impossible. - The cardinal was warned. His men were everywhere. I'm ruined. - Do they have prisoners? - No. None survived. Goodbye, Marie. Goodbye. I'm leaving for Lorraine. Stay! You're safe with the queen's confessor. We must kill the cardinal. - How? He's the devil. - We can't give up. Stay! The queen will help us. I must speak to his Eminence. What's going on? Is it true? His Majesty wants me to dress him? It's true, congratulations. Why congratulations? I was born to serve with my sword. Do you know how many soldiers, counts, and barons would be honored by this position? With all due respect, I have no interest in the king's trousers. I want to be useful. And I want you to obey. The king wants it, and that's enough. Haven't I always helped you, my boy? Didn't I get you a spot in the military academy? Haven't I, since your father's death, advised your mother on raising you? Of course. Then trust me, and be glad to see the most powerful man in the kingdom every day. He makes and breaks men's destinies. If he likes you, your fortune is made. I'm offering you more than a career. A destiny. You'll serve me well near the king. How so? We're at war, Henri. Spanish forces threaten our borders, in Flanders and in the south, in Roussillon. Will we let the king of Spain invade the kingdom, on the pretext that his sister, queen of France, and the Pope in Rome consider Philip IV of Spain more Catholic than us? - No. Of course not. - Then we agree. Now it happens that... the king is smitten with Mademoiselle de Hautefort. Very pious like him, she criticizes my alliances with the protestant states of Sweden and Holland. Well, I expect you to get rid of this harmful woman for me. How? You think I'm more powerful than I am. You're wrong there, Henri. You're clever and attractive. That's what the king likes. You don't think he'll wear this? Why not? The king only wears black, or gray on New Year's Eve. He'll give up this austerity. He's not a protestant as far as I know. Oh, my Lord! You speak of the king, sir. Really? Well, hello, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars. Well! Where is my suit? Here, Sire. Are you joking, sir? What's this gold, these frills? Do you think I'm a marquis trying to be fashionable? I think you're the greatest of monarchs, the king of France, who must impress. You're judging me, Marquis? I'm saying, Sire, that the world will judge you by your clothes. You are France. Your subjects expect you to represent them with the splendor and magnificence they deserve. They'll be proud to see you in something elegant and worthy of the power you embody. I forgive your insolence, as youth is your excuse. But it's not my nature to be ostentatious. "Don't judge a book by its cover," sir. My power is not in my clothes. Don't expect me to wear this outfit. His Majesty the King. Your Majesty, France has never been so brilliantly represented. Light has arrived with you, Sire. Well, Madame! You say nothing? There would be too much to say, Sire. Congratulations, Henri. François! My friend. What joy to see you again. What is this masquerade? You're the laughingstock of the Court. Will you pray in this outfit? Have you forgotten to whom you speak, Madame? It befits the king of France to appear in all the splendor of his power. I expect you to remember that. Sire, this isn't like you. This Marquis de Cinq-Mars is making you ridiculous. A man beholden to Richelieu! Be quiet! Not another word. The Marquis de Cinq-Mars has my full confidence. Treat him with respect! I don't recognize you, Sire. You've always scorned the vanity of the world. Where's the man I love who fears the Lord? That man has long been too indulgent with you. He is annoyed with your manners and asks you to change them. Alas, your Majesty! I cannot share your favors with that fop you're infatuated with. That's enough! Since you do not share my affections, leave the Court. Otherwise, you'll regret it. Farewell! And get married! I'll give you 1,000 crowns. Well, sir! Your star is rising quickly. Be careful or the sun will burn you. There is no sun here but you. Your sparkling eyes alone endanger a heart that burns for you. That is very chivalrous, sir. And you are very convincing. You showed it by turning the king into a sovereign. His Majesty the King! Stay with me, Marquis. Leave the women and let's be friends. First, I'll teach you the customs of the Court. No need, Sire. The king determines the customs and I'm honored by your friendship. You have an answer for everything. I like that. I won't get bored with you. Leave, ladies. Leave! If Mademoiselle de Hautefort is out of favor, we've lost a friend to our cause. It's a victory for the cardinal. Certainly, your Majesty. But I have an idea. If the king is friends with this Marquis, let's have him join our cause. That will be difficult, your Majesty. He is the cardinal's protégé, and son of the Marshal d'Effiat. Oh, yes! That's true. But I hear he's young with charming manners. He may be charmed by you. Come on, Duchess! The idea appeals to you. Why not try it? Your weapons are much more powerful than those of Mr. de Richelieu. Your Majesty, Monsieur de Thou is here with the Marquis de Cinq-Mars whom he'd like you to meet. Perfect timing. Bring in the gentlemen, Mademoiselle. What a nice surprise! Thank you for seeing us, your Majesty. I'd like to introduce my friend, Marquis de Cinq-Mars, who is in charge of the king's wardrobe. Here's the man all Paris is talking about. I'm charmed, Monsieur. It's a huge privilege, your Majesty. I'm at your feet. What do you think, Duchess? He's the most handsome man. Don't compliment him too much, your Majesty. He might get the wrong idea. Mademoiselle de Hautefort is disgraced? - Are you sure? - Absolutely, your Eminence. The king has been charmed by the Marquis and wants him to follow him everywhere. That's better than I hoped, Chavigny. Cinq-Mars is even better than I thought. It was a brilliant idea, your Eminence. As long as Mr. de Cinq-Mars is loyal. What do you mean? He was welcomed by Mr. de Thou, the queen's devoted advisor. They're childhood friends. Where's the harm? I also saw him courting the Duchess de Nevers. Henri is too smart to be snared by her. And at 30, the ex-mistress of Gaston d'Orléans is not a threat. I'm not sure. She's already shown her boundless ambition. I tell you she won't corrupt Henri d'Effiat. What's happening? Did his Holiness Urban VIII breathe his last? Your Eminence, it's a miracle. The queen is pregnant. The queen is pregnant! About time! Let's pray she'll give the king an heir. The queen is pregnant! The queen is pregnant! Your Majesty. Did your quarry escape? A deadly dull hunt. - Where is Mr. de Cinq-Mars? - In Paris, Sire. What? What's he doing there? Doesn't he know he's in my service and I must change after hunting? I want to see him. Go find him, right now! Monsieur de Tréville! I don't know why I yielded to you, Monsieur. Curiosity, I suppose. "Curiosity," Madame? Yes. I admit you intrigue me. I'd like to know how you charmed the king. In the same way you've charmed me, Madame. I loved you at 1st sight. My heart beats only for you. Please, sir. Get up and be reasonable. What do you hope for? That you'll love me as I love you. My God! Only that? I'm moved, I admit. But... Monsieur de Cinq-Mars! What is it? I have orders to bring you back. What does he want now? The king's orders aren't questioned. Go! Don't make his Majesty wait. When will I see you again? That wouldn't be wise. I don't want to be wise. When? Tonight. I'll be waiting. That's an eternity. Don't forget that I love you. Well, Monsieur de Cinq-Mars! Is this how you serve me? Didn't I say you should never leave me? What do say you to that? I thought you were hunting, Sire. And that I should greet the queen. She doesn't need your greetings. You're mine. I want you to stay at my side. The truth, sir. Whom were you seeing? No! Don't tell me. It was a woman. What woman could resist this angelic face? Don't compromise yourself with one of those marquises looking for a mate. That's not my intention, Sire. My ambition is to serve you, rest assured. Well! How do I look? Handsome as Apollo, Sire. To Mr. de Richelieu, who brought you to me. To Mr. de Richelieu, who has let me serve you. Come, now! Don't speak of serving me, I want us to be friends. Open your heart to me. I'll do the same. My heart is yours, Sire. Is it true that you sent Miss de Hautefort away? There's much gossip here. Don't believe it. You were just an excuse. She had irritated me by criticizing the cardinal. She used our time praying to be the voice of the queen and the Pope. It takes a low opinion of the king to think the cardinal's policy is not approved by me. Good night, Henri. I had a nice evening. Good night, Sire. Every moment with you is glorious. I'm eager to see you tomorrow. You've taken a great risk, Marquis. Is it worth it? If necessary, I would've sacrificed my life to see you. I don't have enough words to express my love. This is too much. Your passion scares me. You are clever and the king loves you. It would be mad to compromise your position. What does the king matter if you love me? Say the word and I'll marry you, Madame. My God! Then I would be unreasonable. Do you know the difference in our positions? You're a marquis. But I'm a sovereign duchess. The king will not consent. The king will ignore it because he loves me. The king will have you killed because he loves you. Is there no way? There's a way to reduce the distance between us. Really? Speak. Do you remember the falconer whom the king loved so much? Well? Didn't the king make him duke and Lord Chancellor? You could reach such heights. Then you could claim my hand. You've brought me back to life, Madame. What is this play with 3 duels, Mr. Corneille? This is scandalous. That's not my intention. But The Cid required them. I require you to rewrite it. I didn't give you 1,500 pounds to copy a Spanish play. I was just inspired by an event. Indeed! We're at war with Spain. It's not the time to boast of an enemy's exploits. But your niece liked it very much. I know. It was clever to dedicate it to her. Take this down: "I forbid the play The Cid "to be performed again... "until the Academy has given its opinion." Go, sir! My deep respect, your Eminence. Wait! Here. It's another comedy of mine that you can develop as you like. Just improve it without changing the plot, please. His play has ideas that offend the state. See that the Academy rejects it. We must leave, your Eminence. You'll be late for the council. Dismounting! Your Eminence! Your Eminence, I must speak to you. Just a word, please. I'm in a hurry, Henri. And I don't like the way you show up like this. I'm sorry, but it's important. Come with me, tell me on the way. Are you mad? I'm completely against it, Henri. I'll never agree to it. Nor will the king, or anyone else. So Chavigny was right. You've given in to the evil charms of that conniving woman. Is it possible to be so blinded by passion? This woman manipulates you, Henri, and mocks you. She has but one goal: using you to hurt me. Why else would she agree to marry beneath her? You will not plead my cause? Never! Don't say a word to his Majesty. You're just a simple gentleman elevated by me, you exist only through me. I order you to forget her and devote yourself to your mission: serving me. You'll pay for this, Monsieur de Richelieu. The ingrate threatens me! What have you done by introducing me to the Marquis de Cinq-Mars? I wanted only your happiness, Sire. Does the devil hide behind his beauty? He's afraid of nothing. His insolence has no limits, he's unaware of the respect due a king. You'll soon forget him, Sire. Our armies must attack. Portugal has risen up against Madrid. The Catalan ambassadors are in Paris and ask you to liberate their province. I must congratulate you, sir. Your patience has borne fruit. I'll lead this expedition. We'll push Spain back across the Pyrenees. I'll forget the disappointments of Mr. de Cinq-Mars, who is never where I seek him. He's impulsive, but completely devoted to you, your Majesty. Don't refuse him your favor. He takes advantage of my favor. He takes advantage. Monsieur de Cinq-Mars! His Majesty has been looking for you for hours. - He's in a bad mood. - That's not your concern. Your horse! Never mind. Here's his Majesty. Leave us! What is going on? You're remiss in your duties. I cannot put up with it. Mr. de La Chesnaie told me you ran off to the duchess. She was my brother's mistress. Is it true? Yes, your Majesty. Are you going to preach like Mr. de Richelieu? What do I care what the cardinal said! Here's what the king says. Give up this woman. You'll gain honor and not be drawn into dastardly plots. Can't I serve you and love her? I won't tolerate it. I don't want her to destroy you. Forget her. To console you, if you promise to break it off, I'll give you 1,500 crowns and make you First Squire. What do you say? As Wardrobe Master, this duty does not raise my status. Then what will satisfy you? Make me Grand Squire, your Majesty. Aren't I the son of a marshal of France? That is one of the most prestigious titles, Henri. Many illustrious men seek it. But I'll grant it to you. Be worthy of it. I'll ride with you to Perpignan which we'll besiege together to take Roussillon from the Spanish. I'll fight to the death beside you, Sire. So I swear before God. Stand up, Grand Squire, it's not about dying, but living. Alive or dead, I'm yours, Sire. And I give you my heart. And I promise no other will share it. Well! What is it? Be glad. We will soon be joined by the sacred bonds of marriage. The king made me his Grand Squire. Tomorrow, I'll be a duke and a French peer. Congratulations, Grand Squire. The king must love you. Perhaps he'll make you duke and supreme commander. You forget the man who won't let us marry. I know, the cardinal. He refused. He hates you as much as you hate him. I hate him because he is ruining France. Because he's made the king his servant, because he attacks the queen and kills good Christians. He has blood on his hands. - We must stop him. - How? The king trusts him. But the king loves you. You can tell him the cardinal spies on him and makes him a puppet. He must know who really controls the country. Did I hear you right, Madame? You ask me to betray the man who helped me and gave me the chance to meet you? What loyalty do you owe a man who forbids you to love? Will we never be happy? Must he tyrannize us as he tyrannizes France? The cardinal is using you, Henri. You're just a pawn in his game. And your happiness will last only if you serve his plans. Believe me. By fighting him, you'll avoid inevitable disgrace. It's doomed to fail. The king's faith in the cardinal can't be shaken. Then we must take other action. How? Do you love me, Henri? Can you doubt it? I love you too. And in love, the means do not matter. Hurry! The time has come, my friends. The king leaves Paris tomorrow with the army, leaving the cardinal to his dirty dealings. This time, we won't fail. The cardinal must not know... I bring you a man who is on our side, gentlemen. You put us in great danger, Madame. It's madness to bring the cardinal's creature here. He works for Richelieu. Do you doubt my word? That's enough. Put away your swords. I vouch for Mr. de Cinq-Mars. It's true that the cardinal aided in my happy destiny, but he has asked for too much in return. I refused to spy on the king and his ways disgust me. I see that there is too much blood spilled, too many taxes, and too much poverty. Welcome, Grand Squire. What do you think of a pension of 40,000 crowns from his Majesty Philip IV of Spain? I think it sounds very good. Consider it done. I knew you'd join us. Here's where things stand. Fontrailles will leave tonight for Madrid with our treaty offer for the king, stating that, when the cardinal's death is announced, 9,000 horsemen in Roussillon will invade the kingdom at my orders. This is agreed by her Majesty Queen Anne of Austria. Don't speak the queen's name. He's right. The queen must never be implicated in our actions. Have no fear. No one will leave without swearing an oath. Your swords, gentlemen. Swear by the Holy Virgin to always keep our plot secret and never reveal our names or that of the queen. I swear! If it's true that Cinq-Mars has joined my enemies, he'll pay for this betrayal. - Should we arrest them? - No. I want to know what they're plotting and catch them in the act. How many are there? About a dozen. I recognize the queen's advisor. He'll pay for it with his life. For now, watch them and keep me informed. Your Eminence. I never should've brought Henri d'Effiat into the king's service. I acted upon foolish emotion. In politics, you can't trust your feelings. Wait before blaming him. Perhaps he's working for us. No. He's betrayed me, I know it. And yet you warned me. How could I imagine he'd fall in love with Marie de Gonzague? My worst enemy. He's in her power. And Henri isn't Rodrigue. His passion defeats his honor and he'll betray me. I can't believe it. Your Eminence. Your Eminence! The viscount de Fontrailles was seen in Orléans, disguised as a monk. He's going to Spain. How do you know? His squire. - He spoke but will speak no more. - Very good. Is Mr. d'Orléans still hiding at Saint-Sulpice Abbey? He hasn't left, your Eminence. Let him stay there! He can't pray enough to save his soul. Watch him. My lord. If Gaston d'Orléans' damned soul runs to Madrid, it's to tell our enemies of our plans. Places, gentlemen. His Majesty arrives. Well, Grand Squire! What do you want? His Majesty asked me to attend the council, your Eminence. You don't belong here, Grand Squire. Withdraw. But the king... I order you to leave, little marquis! My orders suffice. This is not the king's council, it's a war council. You're not an army officer as far as I know. War is not your concern. For the last time, leave this place immediately. Where are you going? Isn't it time for the council? What's wrong? You're so pale... It's painful for me to refuse you, Sire. I wouldn't help you by meeting with the captains who lead your armies. I don't have their knowledge or experience of war. I recognize your pure and loyal heart. We'll gather our troops here, in Narbonne, before entering Roussillon at his Majesty's orders. Go on, Monsieur de Richelieu. I invited the Grand Squire, but he thought himself unworthy. We should praise his wisdom and discernment. I will tell him. Well! How does our expedition look? Very good, Sire. Our forces are stronger. The Duke d'Olivares holds the fort of Rivesaltes that we must take before reaching Perpignan. That could cause heavy losses. Couldn't we count on some turncoats? If we give pensions to some townspeople, they'll open the gates. You read my mind, your Majesty. My agents are working on it. Gentlemen, The French crown has an heir. Long live Louis, dauphin of France. Long live Louis, dauphin of France. Marie! Marie! It's decided. I'll kill the cardinal myself. Quiet. Do you want to go to the Bastille? - What fury! - You will hear of it. From rumors, alas. I swear it. He'll pay for insulting me. Calm down! No. I don't want calm, I want revenge. Not so rash. The king loves you, have him banish the cardinal. Or better yet: get his blessing to kill him. Blessing or no blessing, Richelieu will die. I leave with his Majesty for Narbonne. I'll wait for the cardinal and do it. Let his Highness know. I fear for you, Henri. Let the assassins of the king of Spain do it. You don't understand, Marie. Not satisfied with refusing our marriage, Mr. de Richelieu besmirched my name in front of the lords. I won't be worthy of you until I've killed him. May God protect you! If you succeed, Henri, a great destiny awaits you. Awaits us, Marie. Never doubt my love. I miss you already. Come back safe and sound. I can't take it anymore. My legs are stiff as logs. A 5-hour ride! At this rate, we'll be there in 1 week. When does the cardinal leave Paris? Tomorrow morning. His rheumatism makes him break up the trip. He'll sleep here tomorrow, at the mayor's, inside the city walls. Isn't he too old to manage the government? What do you mean? You gave him this position 18 years ago. Aren't you tired of these rebellions? Of the blood he spills for his own glory? Such talk could land you in the Bastille, Henri. I love you, so I speak my mind. I'm not one of those flatterers who talk behind your back. That's true. That's why I love and forgive you. I know my prime minister's flaws better than anyone. I know his love of the money he's amassed. I know his vain pretentions to write plays. It's amusing to see him enraged at Corneille's success while he has The Cid banned by his Academy out of jealousy. I laugh at his ambition to build an ideal city named after himself: Richelieu. He prefers matters of state to those of the church and skips saying mass to go see his mistresses, the most beautiful women in Paris. What is there to add? That he likes shedding blood. and cutting off the heads of great nobles. And killing your soldiers on the battlefield, and massacring your peasants who rebel against poverty. What is there to add? That he likes spying on everyone for better control. Starting with his king. The cardinal spies on me? Your valet, Mr. de La Chesnaie, goes to his palace on Tuesdays to tell him all your words and actions. If that's true, his Eminence must explain himself. But have you by any chance become his enemy? Can't I both criticize and love him, Sire? Be careful. Attacking him means attacking me. You don't know what ruling France is like. The kingdom consists of many peoples: Normans, Bretons, Basques, Burgundians, Picards, Provençals... Making them agree to a common destiny called France and putting them under a single authority: that's the cardinal's ultimate plan. Why give him so much power? Aren't you the king? With such an intelligent man who wants France's glory in my service, I must step back, Henri. But nothing is done without my agreement. The cardinal tells me what he does every day. We decide together. And because of his good judgment and trust in you I can open my heart to you without fear. It's shameful! How can a cardinal make alliances with heretics to fight my brother, the very Catholic king? Mr. de Richelieu's only religion is serving the state. Your Majesty, the Marquis de Mirabel is here and would like to see you. Show him in and leave us, please. Antonio. What news? Here's the treaty signed by the king, your brother, your Majesty. You and Gaston d'Orléans alone have a copy. Does he accept our conditions? All of them, your Majesty. God is with us. Only one thing is lacking. What is it? The cardinal's death. Have you lost your head, Mademoiselle? Coming here in the daytime. Something is going on. The queen has been agitated for days. She can't sleep and is easily irritated. You want to tell me of the queen's moods? That's not all. Yesterday, the Marquis de Mirabel came to see her. Later that night, her Majesty wouldn't let me undress her for bed. Well? She must have been hiding a document on her person that she hid in her trunk in the secret drawer. Thank you for telling me this, Mademoiselle. Go back to her. A plot is afoot. And I suspect Anne of Austria is part of it. How can we be sure? By attacking. That's the best defense. Your Majesty, his Eminence would like to see you. My God! What can he want? Don't make him wait. Excuse my intrusion, your Majesty. I came to pay my respects before leaving to join the king. I'm touched. I know your time is precious and your work is heavy. Nothing would be possible without the king's trust. Yes. I pray for his victory every day. But it breaks my heart to see so many Catholics kill each other, when my brother offers peace. I have a request, your Majesty. "A request," your Eminence? Before this journey from which I may never return, I'd like to greet the dauphin. Of course. Mademoiselle de Chémerault! Your Majesty? Ask Madame de Lansac to bring the dauphin Louis to the cardinal. Right away, your Majesty. I'll pray for your safe return, your Eminence. I'm sure that your fervent and sincere prayers will protect me. May God protect your Highness! Enjoy him before the king returns, your Majesty. What do you mean, your Eminence? Before he left, the king told me he won't let you bring up the prince. But why? His Majesty is fed up with your plotting with France's enemies. You understand he cannot stand for the queen of France to share intelligence with those he is fighting. Some at the Court even call it... treason. Take away my son? I couldn't bear it. A sign of good faith would make his Majesty give up this plan, which he is reluctant to carry out. You will have it, Monsieur de Richelieu. Father! Father! What's going on? You must save me, Father. The king and the cardinal suspect me of treason. They threaten to take away my child. Calm down, your Highness. No one will talk. We all took an oath. Oaths are worth little in prison. You must help me, Father. - What can I do? - Here. Take this document. Get it into the cardinal's hands. - How? - It doesn't matter. No one must know how he came by it. Or it's death for you. Trust me. How can I refuse you, your Majesty? At dawn, I'll send one of my monks. He won't speak, for he's mute. God bless you, Father. Bishop's Palace in Narbonne Welcome, Count. Thank you, your Excellency. Victory! Long live the king! Take care of the wounded. Come, let me kiss you. I've never seen such courage. - I only did my duty. - More than that. But promise you'll risk your life no more. I can't lose you. My life doesn't count, Sire. Think only of your glory. How I love you! Come. Let's celebrate your exploits. Count, here you are finally! Where's my prime minister? Resting in Narbonne. His rheumatism pains him. He'll be happy to see you if you go there. We'll go, Count. Let's celebrate the Grand Squire, who took the fort of Rivesaltes, an incredible feat. Congratulations, Monsieur. You should've seen his energy as he led his men. He seemed immortal. Alas, we suffered losses. The essential thing is that you're alive. Monsieur de Chavigny, tell his Eminence we'll come see him. I want to tell him of our victory. If Henri d'Effiat shone in battle as you say, we should be glad, Chavigny. It was time he did something. Indeed. The king showers him with praise and has never been so taken with him. What is that? A mixture of frog and bat secretions that a Jewish doctor recommended. Fine. We're a step away from heresy. Who are you? Wait. Stop him! By the devil's horns! He's dead. Well, Chavigny! Did you see the devil? Almost, my lord. Look at this. The seal of the house of Austria. - What is this? - I don't know. It was given to me by a monk who killed himself rather than be taken. He must've had a good reason to prefer hell to heaven. By the Holy Spirit! It's impossible. Well? This is high treason, Chavigny. A conspiracy as never seen in France. What exactly? A shameful treaty signed in great secrecy between the king of Spain and Gaston of France. To stab us in the back. The traitor sold the kingdom to our enemies. All the names are here: Duke de Bouillon, Count de Fontrailles, and guess who? The Marquis de Cinq-Mars. A serpent that I raised myself. An ingrate given glory who kisses the king even as he kills him. It's an unspeakable crime. We must take action. We will, Chavigny. Don't worry. I'd like to know who brought us this evidence for the upcoming trial. Should I take it to the king? No. I must show it to him myself. Otherwise you'd be in danger. In danger? He is so blinded by his passion for Cinq-Mars that he'll call you a liar and have you killed. Your Majesty. What joy to see you, my dear minister! Have you heard the news? Thanks to the Grand Squire, the way is clear for the siege of Perpignan. I'm glad, your Majesty. My warmest congratulations, Grand Squire. His bravery was so outstanding that I gave him the command of our army. That's not appropriate, your Majesty. Excuse me? Why not? Many generals with titles grander than that of marquis will be insulted. Their titles are not titles of glory. Do you seek to anger me? Am I king, yes or no? Do you doubt my ability to decide who should lead our army? Don't insist, Sire. Mr. de Richelieu thinks I'm unworthy of dying on a battlefield. I judge you for what you are, Mr. de Cinq-Mars. Explain yourself, your Eminence. I have nothing to say to you. Leave. I must speak to the king. My word, your Eminence! Believe me, your Majesty. I must speak to you now of an extremely important matter. This is the last time you show me the door, sir. Finally, something we can agree on. Henri! I'm very displeased, your Eminence. You know my affection for him. Why treat him that way in front of me? Here's my answer, your Majesty. It's not possible. This is a crude forgery. Alas, Sire. Those are indeed the signatures of Philip IV and your brother. And the seal is from the house of Austria. "It is decided that his Majesty Philip IV "will deal only with his Highness Gaston of France "and that Spain will recover all the forts that "King Louis XIII has..." If this treachery is real, it's the most vile treason. What did I do to my brother that he should plot against me? You reign, your Majesty. He was always my mother's favorite. Marie de Medici made him unreliable, a fickle man who fucked all the women of my Court! Finish reading, your Majesty. You don't yet know all. "150,000-crown pension for his Highness Gaston d'Orléans, "20,000 crowns for the viscount de Fontrailles, "40,000 crowns for the Grand Squire..." No. It's impossible. This is not true. It's another one of your schemes! I won't be fooled. This time you've gone too far. What do you accuse me of, your Majesty? Of adding his name to this shameful conspiracy. You hate him because he won't serve you. He told me so. You're capable of such deception, sir. Accusing Henri d'Effiat of high treason when he just risked his life at Rivesaltes... it makes no sense. That's possible, your Majesty. I'd like to believe it. But the kingdom is at stake and you must not hesitate. You must sign prison orders, so our soldiers can seize these traitors. We can release the Grand Squire when he proves his innocence. But if he's guilty, he will flee. Let's keep my brother from doing more harm. He's the soul of the plot. It won't be easy. But knowing his vanity, we've perfected a trap that will bring him to us. I'll kill him! I tell you, I'll... I'll kill him tonight. You should've done it just now. In front of the king? That's impossible. But I'll do it tonight. I'll smother him in his sleep, and no one will miss him. From someone who wishes you well. "You're in danger. Flee." Big news. You're mad! It's the king's handwriting. Why not the Pope's? Good God, save yourself! Don't you see you're in danger, despite the king's friendship? I don't fear the cardinal. We found him in a tavern. The king will punish you for this humiliation, Cardinal. Tonight you'll be taken to Lyon and secretly put in the royal fort of Pierre-Encise, until your accomplices join you, Grand Squire. What accomplices? What are you talking about? Take him away! Wait. What do you accuse me of? Your Eminence! Answer. I want to see the king. I want to see Louis. Château of the Duke de Lorraine You here? Greetings, your Highness. I've ridden for 6 days to bring you an order from the king. From my brother? I'm listening. He wants you to command the army of Champagne to defend our borders against the Spanish. Here's his letter naming you general. I will heed my brother's call. I'll saddle my horse and come with you. My sword! Thank the duke, gentlemen. And safe travels. Your Highness, please, give me your sword. What, Count? Upon the king's order, I arrest you! Your Majesty, Mr. de Thou needs to speak with you urgently. We've been betrayed. My God! How is it possible? A copy of the treaty fell into the cardinal's hands. It's a betrayal. "A betrayal"? By whom? Will we ever know? Farewell. I must leave France before I'm arrested. Your Majesty! Your Majesty, open up! King's orders. It's too late. Farewell, Madame. I love you and will never reveal your name, even under questioning. Thank you, my friend. May God protect you! Your Majesty! I have orders to arrest Mr. de Thou. Well, go ahead, captain! Go ahead! I'm yours, Monsieur d'Artagnan. Perpignan is ours, Sire. The admiral's ships have destroyed the Spanish fleet. And the people opened the gates. The Spanish are fleeing for the Pyrenees. That's good, Tréville. What news of the Grand Squire? "The Grand Squire"? He was arrested, Sire. "Arrested"? Arrested, you say? His Eminence took him to Lyon to be tried. Maybe that's best. He'll soon be declared innocent. It cannot be otherwise. To your horses! To Lyon! Royal Prison of Lyon How you've disappointed me. As you have me, my lord. Your insolence won't save you. I'm not the king. That's certain. You have neither his imagination nor his deep soul. You don't know me well. I know your heart is barren and that's enough. What are you made of? Is there blood in your veins? Enough that I believed in you, but you're not what I hoped. You did not inherit your father's moral values. I forbid you to speak of my father or of morals. The game is over, Henri. No more indulgence. You're in the hands of justice. What "justice"? Yours? Which condemns before the trial? I'm only guilty of loving a duchess and being loved by the king. Very little indeed. How could you get involved in this conspiracy betraying France to Spain? Was it love for the Duchess de Nevers or hatred for me, though I treated you like a son? "A son"? You deceive yourself, sir. You know nothing of a father's love. A father wants only his child's happiness. But you, charitable soul, want to have spies everywhere and people to serve you. Bringing you into the sublime workings of my politics was my greatest sign of love. Is politics everything to you? Farewell. The chancellor will question you. I have nothing to say to him. Think it over. Your life is at stake. His Majesty will free me. He knows what love is. I was impressed by the ruse you used to offer me these... lovely lodgings, Monsieur du Plessis. What does my brother accuse me of this time? Something that threatens your very life. You have committed a crime against the state that cannot be pardoned. Impossible, your Eminence. As God is my witness, I've always been loyal to France and the king. Do you know this treaty? It's signed by you and King Philip IV of Spain. Who gave you this? The only way to save yourself is to make a full confession. I'll tell all, your Eminence, if the king will pardon me. The names of those who took part in this high treason? Yes. Starting with the Grand Squire who is the mastermind. I expected more nobility from the son of Henri IV. It's true that you've already sold many of your friends. I said only the truth, as you asked. To each his own truth, your Highness. What do you mean? I'm a prince of the blood. The king alone can judge my actions! Your Majesty! I must speak with you. In private. What is it? We must save the Grand Squire. The cardinal has arrested him. Are you in love with Mr. de Cinq-Mars? I can't believe it. It doesn't matter whether or not I love him. I don't want him to die. You're losing your head, Marie. The king loves him too much. He'll never let the cardinal go so far. I already told his Eminence I have nothing to say. It doesn't matter. Here's the statement of his Highness, Duke d'Orléans. He accuses you of many crimes. Another of the cardinal's tricks. Read it yourself. And see the signature at the bottom. Does a prince's oath mean nothing? I believed in him and he sends me to my death. You cannot trust the powerful, Marquis. They play with our lives. But you can save yours. Tell us how and why you got involved in this crime. Where is he? I want to see the Grand Squire right now! That's impossible, Sire. The chancellor is questioning him now in prison. He'll go free. Henri is innocent. My respects, your Majesty. Well, sir, have you released the Grand Squire? He's guilty, Sire. That's impossible. He just admitted his crimes. Look, Sire. These are lies! Henri couldn't betray me. I know him. He's a pure soul led astray by my cunning brother. You're the guilty one. You can't forgive him for loving me more than you. Your resentment isn't motivated by the kingdom, but by your bitter heart. You want revenge against this child whom you pampered but whose love you lost. Isn't that true, Monsieur de Richelieu ? You are confused, Majesty. My only concern is for your safety and glory. You couldn't stand him leaving you or me loving him. Or that he's free as a bird. You rejected him, humiliated him, made him desperate. And you'll condemn him to make him disappear forever. I want the king's justice to punish those who threaten state security. Mr. de Cinq-Mars, along with Mr. de Thou, is guilty of high treason. He must die. My only mistake was introducing him to you. So you're as guilty as he is. I demand the Grand Squire be set free. In that case, Sire, you must free me of my government duties. What? You'll put your ministry at stake? Have I any choice? A king must prefer justice to pity. Henri d'Effiat must die for betraying you and France. No! I won't have it. I won't allow it. Others have died for less. Do you know no pity? You would compromise all that we've built for years, your Majesty. Will you put your authority and the unity of the kingdom in danger? Forget your heart and its passions, Sire. Sign, and think of your subjects who want justice to protect them from traitors, even those who are handsome, young, and charming. Sign. Be strong with me. As we've always been. Sign. You know I'm right. Will I never have peace? Only the peace of the kingdom counts, Sire. By signing, you aren't striking a head, but raising your throne. Are you satisfied, Prime Minister? You have your enemies' head. I have no enemies but those of the state, Sire. Where are you going? To Paris, your Majesty, where the university leaders wait for me to inaugurate the new Sorbonne we have built. It's not a humane task to rule France, Chavigny. You've given France your all for 18 years, your Eminence. It's never been so powerful. There's still much to be done. And my remaining time is short. Positions! Lift! March! Leave! Get out, all of you! All! No. I want to die with my eyes open. God knows I loved that child. Subtitles: Eclair Group
