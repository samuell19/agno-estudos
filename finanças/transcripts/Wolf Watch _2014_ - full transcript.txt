[Dramatic music] [Applause] Welcome to Wolf Watch, everybody. I'm your host, Jill Wagner, with the one, the only, DJ Cole Plante at my side. - Whoo! - Cole, Cole, Cole! And we're changing things up a bit tonight for the show. In honor of the fifth episode of the season, we've got singing sensation Fifth Harmony on the couch. [Cheers and applause] So please welcome Ally... - Hi. - Normani... - Hey. - Lauren... Dinah and Camila. - Yeah. - Hey! Okay, ladies. First of all, I just want to know why you guys are drawn to the show and what you love about the show. - The acting is incredible. - So good. - Phenomenal. - Also, I love how it's... you know, the theme of it is supernatural, but the banter between the characters is so relatable and it's so witty, and it kind of makes you want to be in that supernatural world. Although, realistically, I'd probably die in, - like, two seconds. - Yeah, you would. - She would. - But still... All right, let's talk about this episode... - Let's do it. - Because this was a good one. - Let's get juicy. - It was. - So good. - Yes. Garret and Violet's cover has kind of been blown. Do you guys think that there's gonna be more murders? Well, considering that at the end of the episode, um, - Violet was strangled by Skye... - Yeah. And she kind of fell to the floor, I am assuming... - I thought she died. - Right? This is just me assuming, so I could be completely wrong, - but I'm assuming that she has... - I feel like she's not dead. Is not with us anymore because she tried to, you know, go against Scott, and that just didn't work out for her. - Or there can be a plot twist. - And I feel like... I feel like Garrett will be weakened by that. Cole, what's your predictions for what's gonna happen next? You... so you seem to always have these great predictions. I think Garrett's gonna try and save Violet, in a sense, from wherever she might be. Mm-hmm. I think Scott's gonna be hunting Garret. And I think more killers might be introduced, because that seems to be the theme of all the episodes. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. So Scott was able to break through the thermal cut wire. Right. Which, by the way, where can I get one? - I don't know how he did it. - Kind of cool. - I know. - I'm just saying. - I kind of want one. - Yeah. - Kind of cool. - Stylish, right? Normani, would you ever go up against an Alpha? Personally, I choose my battles wisely. I don't think, like, I would go against Scott just because, you know, he's the lead man. He knows what he's doing. And I think that he would probably, - like, just murder me. - [Laughter] Um, okay, Cole, Liam admits that he has intermittent explosive disorder. - I.E.D. - I.E.D. - What a play on words, huh? - Yeah, mm-hmm. So how is that gonna be for Scott to try to tame the wolf in him? I mean, that's gonna be a little difficult, don't you think? I think of all the people who were to try and tame him, I think Scott's the best option... - Absolutely. - Because he got bitten himself by Peter and he's controlled it at this point. He's an Alpha now, so he has that leader quality in him. And Liam's basically going through the same thing Scott went through when he first got bit. So I think he's actually the best mentor. Absolutely. Well, let's move on to see what we can add to our Wolf Stats. No transformations this week, but we did have shirtless Brett. [All cheering] I'm sorry, everyone, there was no hookups either. [All groaning] Boo! - But we did get one death... - Boo! Which I'm very happy about. Carrie was killed by Garrett. I'm sorry, Carrie. Ah, which means deaths are still way ahead so far this season. And for our bonus stat, six is the number of digits Meredith was missing to make a proper phone number. [Laughter] Of course, it's more if it's international. Fortunately, Lydia was able to crack the code anyway. - Whoo! - Lydia! - [Cheers and applause] - Okay, now, here's where we stand with our numbers for the season overall. Guess what. It's time for a bonus scene from next week's episode, courtesy of Kate. Oh, yeah. Check it out. Big fancy guns... Coded death lists... So called assassins... And not one of you can answer the simplest question... [Grunts] Who's paying the bills? So I'll ask again. Who is the Benefactor? I swear to God, I've never seen him, - never spoken to him. - I know. See, everybody says the same thing. They don't know who he is, where he is. "It's all done electronically. I can't help you. Please, I'm bleeding to death. Please, stop. - It hurts." - Then what do you want with me? It's been a long time since someone's made me a mixed tape. You got one too, didn't you? No, no. But I... but I know who did. They look like kids. Like teenagers. They're called the Orphans. Thank you, Kate Argent. - Applause, applause. - [Cheers and applause] Okay, we have to take our first break, but coming up, we'll name our next Wolf Crush of the Week. All: Oh! And as always, we have a sneak peek at next week's episode. Cole, music please. - [Dance music] - [Cheers and applause] [Dance music] I would definitely rather be a pack member, because if someone dies, I don't want it to be on me. Personally, I would be a third option. I would be, like, an omega. I would... I kind of do my own thing. I would just be like, "you guys are cool. I'll meet you there." I would be comfortable being a leader of the pack, but at the same time if the situation calls for it and there's already somebody that's filling that role, I think I'd be happy to contribute in whatever way I could, which I guess kind of makes me like Garrett in a weird way. I'm an egocentric actor. I'd rather be the leader of the pack probably. Maybe I'd become a pack member and then build myself up. That would be... that would be the way to do it, I think. No, I'd definitely rather be the leader of the pack. You've always got to be a leader, never be a follower. But don't eat people. I'd rather be a pack member because being a leader is fun, I guess, but most of the time, it's not. If everyone gets mad at you, you're screwed. Oh, if I had to choose, I'm definitely the leader of the pack. There's no way I'm following along with somebody. It's like, "no, no, no, you're gonna listen to me and you're gonna follow what I say." - [Dance music] - [Cheers and applause] â™ª Welcome back to Wolf Watch. I'm Jill Wagner, kicking back with DJ Cole Plante and Fifth Harmony, my girls. - Whoo! - Yeah! - Please... - And, ladies, you guys have a lot going on this summer. - Yes, ma'am. - Really. - Busy, busy, busy. - Very busy. - So your new single, Boss... - Yes! That just came out a few weeks ago... - Yeah! - So can you tell me the message behind the song? It's pretty much like kind of owning yourself and your independence and being confident with yourself and just kind of showing that to the world. And being, like, the boss of your own life. - Yeah. - So it's the first single from your album Coming Out. Can you tell me about the album? It's leaning in a different direction than we had originally. - It's a lot more urban... - Mm-hmm. And it's a lot more rhythmic. Obviously, we're a girl group, so the theme of girl power - and female empowerment... - Whoo! Has to be present. - But I feel like... - Yeah! - Right here, baby. - Yes! Yes! - Right here, girl. - Cool. All: Yeah! You don't get it because you're a male. - Aww. - It's okay. - No, sorry, Cole. - Sorry, Cole! - Just kidding. - I love you. We still love you. It's just sassy. It's nice. - Yeah. - Okay, I love that. So I heard from a little birdie... - Oh, snap. - That you guys know Cole. All: Yes! Um, we were on tour with him... - For the Demi Lovato Tour. - For the Demi Lovato Tour. Yeah, the tour was incredible. Yeah. And you're about to go on tour with Austin Mahone. - All: Yes. - There it is. - Yeah. - So excited. Yeah, tell me about that. We're super excited. Um, Austin, he's a really great person and we're excited to just go on tour with guys in general. - Yeah. - Just because, you know, - we're always around each other. - Yay, boys. Plus we're also going to be playing a lot of new songs from our new album. - Yes. - Yeah, that's really exciting. All right, everyone, switching gears for a minute. Every episode of Teen Wolf features a lot of crush-worthy guys. Oh, yes. Amen. But in honor of our girl power show tonight, we're choosing a lady for our Wolf Crush of the Week. - Yes! - Yes, we are. - Whoo! - Yes, we are. And Lydia is our lady. - We love, love, love Lydia. - She is. All: Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia! She was able to unlock the second section of the dead pool, and even under all that stress, she still looked glowing. All: Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia! All right, it's time to check in with our trusty Wolf Watch correspondent Tyler Posey. - Yeah. - Tyler! And to celebrate Fifth Harmony's visit, he came up with a list of ten things to bring harmony to your relationship. - Oh, you shouldn't have. - All: Aww. - Tyler, take it away. - So cute. I've got to say, getting bitten by a werewolf and fighting off bad guys can put a damper on one's love life. But I've learned a thing or two about what works. So I'd like to share ten things to bring harmony to your relationship. Number ten, don't drag your guy to an ancient ruin in Mexico and turn him into a teenager. That's a given. It should go without saying. Number nine, just because you're stuck in an underground lair, doesn't mean you can't have a little romance. Mwah! Number eight, if she turns your dials... [Radio static] Don't hold it against her. Number seven, if you hear voices, keep it to yourself. Number six, remind him that you're "Star-lacrossed" lovers. Get it? Number five, be open to meeting people at work, because you never know where love will find you. Number four, don't give her a grandma kiss, please. Number three, don't be jealous if your girl likes to dance with someone else. Number two, a couple that slays together, stays together. And number one, when in doubt about math, make out. - Whoo! - [Cheers and applause] - Yay. - All right. We have to take another break. But coming up, we'll find out if Fifth Harmony's drawing skills are as good as their singing voices. And we'll give you a preview of next week's episode presented by AT&T. Cole, you know what I want. I want music. - [Dance music] - [Cheers and applause] [Dance music] [Cheers and applause] I'm Jill Wagner, joined as always by DJ Cole Plante, and we're spending time with Ally, Normani, Lauren, Dinah, and Camila, also known as Fifth Harmony. - Whoo! - Howdy. All right, it's time to play one of my favorite Wolf Watch games. I'm dividing you up. Ally, Normani, and Lauren on one team, and Dinah, Camila, and Cole on the other. One person from each team will pick Teen Wolf terms out of a container and then draw them on that giant pad while your teammates try to guess what the picture represents. Now, the team has until this timer full of mountain ash runs out to get as many as you can. And whichever team gets more right will be our winner. - We got it. - Let's play drawing blood. Ally's team, you're up first. - Yeah! - Okay. - All right. - Come on, Lauren. We got this. Whoo! - Yeah. - Don't let them distract you. - Yeah. - Okay, ready? - Go on your cue. - You got this, girl. One, two, three. - Come on, Lauren. - Starts now. - I believe in you! - Hurry, hurry. All right. - We can't guess, right? - Lacrosse? - No. - Soccer. - Goal. - Goal? - Yes. - Yes! - Go, go, go, go! - [Cheers and applause] Go, go. Come on, go, go. - Is that the nose? - What is that? Oh, you're not supposed to guess. - Um, eyes. - Glowing eyes, glowing eyes. - Wolf eyes. Wolf eyes. - Glowing eyes. - Wolf eyes. - Are you kidding? Oh, my gosh, that was awesome. - Thanks. - Hurry! You probably have one more. Go, go, go, go! - Lauren. - She already sees the answer. - And... - Both: Lacrosse! - We're out of time. - [Buzzer] - Did we get that one? - That was it. It's... what is it, though? - Ah, no, we're out of time. - Shoot. - Dang it. - It was so close, though. - They would have gotten it. - Dang it. - It's a lacrosse stick. - Oh, crap. - I said lacrosse. - You guys would have gotten it. - Lacrosse is a game. - Good drawing, Lauren. - Good drawing. Good job. - [Cheers and applause] Okay, Dinah, get up here. - Okay. - Yeah! - Good luck, girl. - Let's do it. - Kill 'em! - Let's go, team killer! - Team, team. - Huh! [Laughter] - Ready to win, guys? - Ready to win. Let's do it. Great. - Ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Okay, let's go. - You go. - All right. - Okay. - Let's do this. - [Gasps] Oh! - Put the card down. - Ice cube. Ah! - It's a king. It's a... - Toma... - Tomahawk. - You don't... No, she cheated! She cheated! - You can't give them one. - [Overlapping shouting] - That's cheating! - That is cheating. - You can't get that one. - Dinah. - Ah, hair, Mohawk. - A pineapple? - That's definitely a pineapple. - A sun. I'm trying to look at what that could be. - Claws! Claws! - She wrote it! Both: She wrote it down! - It's claws! - No, I didn't. - Yes, you... You know you don't get any of these. - Just win. - Claws. I don't... I don't want to know what it is. - A toenail. - Come on, Cole. - A phone, phone. - A phone. - Yes! - Yes, yes, yes. Keep going. Okay. - Hurry! Here! - Oh, God. - Get one... one more, one more. - Both: Time! Time! [Buzzer] It's done! - Time. - Aah! God. I'm surprised you couldn't get those, Cole. All right. That's okay. What can I call your team? The Wolf Eyes. The Wolf Eyes. The Wolf Eyes win. You guys win this jersey, - Teen Wolf jersey. - Yay! - Season two of Wolf Watch. - So cool! - Whoo! - There you go. Here you go, here's one for each of you. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, and I'm not done. 'Cause now, we're getting fashionable here on Wolf Watch. The glasses. Oh, yes. The Wolf Watch glasses. Don't we get shirts for being nice? - We get the glasses too? - Look. â™ª And I'm not done, I'm not done â™ª - Oh, shoot. - Look at that. We need to come on this show more often. Guess what. You get a gold mug that says, - "Wolf Watch winner." - [Cheers and applause] - Rub it in, Jill. - Hey! - Rub it in. - Here. Here's the mugs. And this is my most fun part of the thing because I get to give away stuff. Um, you guys get a Wolf Watch loser mug. - Ooh! - Yay! You can pass that back to them. Sorry, guys. You can rub it in a little bit. - There you go, guys. - We're the real winners. All right, and now, here's a gift that everyone can enjoy... it's another bonus scene from next week's episode of Teen Wolf. - Check this out. - Ooh! - [Gagging] - Ah! What the hell is happening to this kid? He's been poisoned by a rare wolfsbane. I need to make an incision and you need to hold him as still as possible. Hey, Derek, how about a little werewolf strength? Hey, I'm not the only one here with werewolf strength. If you can't hold him still, the incision might kill him. [Gagging, groaning] I think he's slipping. Don't think I can hold him. - Ah! - Whoa! Ah! I guess I still have a little werewolf strength myself. Yeah, maybe more than a little. All right, everybody, when we get back, we'll meet our Alpha of the Week. And you definitely want to stick around for a sneak peak of next week's episode of Teen Wolf. Oh, yeah. Let's get some music, Cole. - [Dance music] - Come on, Cole. [Cheers and applause] - [Dance music] - [Cheers and applause] Welcome back to Wolf Watch. I'm here with our DJ Cole Plante. Throughout the show I've been talking to the ladies - of Fifth Harmony. - Yeah! - I love you guys. - Hi. - Yeah! - Ah, but now, I want to talk to one of the fans, our Alpha of the week. And this week's Alpha is from Canada... - Okay. - Whoo! And she shows off her mega-fandom by making Teen Wolf buttons with clever catchphrases on them. - Wow. - And she's joining us via video chat, so let's welcome Eri. - Hi, Eri. - All: Hi! - Hi, Eri! - Hi, Eri! So I want to get into these buttons that you do. - These are amazing and they're so cool. - Thank you. How long have you been doing this? Well, I started making buttons about six years ago. I got the machine just for fun, and it really quickly turned into making buttons for a lot of different fandoms, really nerdy things. Um, and there's so many, like, really quotable moments on this show that it was really easy to be like, "oh, this needs to be a button, and this needs to be a button." Nice, very cool. So, um, I hear that you met Tyler. - Yes. - There you are with Tyler. - Aww. - Yay. Awesome. - I have a Teen Wolf tattoo. - You do? - And you showed him your tattoo? - Yeah. - And what did he say? - He was so excited. He was bouncing around the room. He was like, "that's like my tattoo, and like Scott's tattoo. - We kind of match." - Aww. He's a really, really cool guy, isn't he? - Aww. - Yes. - He's a sweetheart. - Yeah. So you know I have some guests here with me. - Fifth Harmony. - All: Hi! - What's up? - I just want to know if you... if you have any questions for any of us. I have questions for you and for them. - Okay. - But the one that I want to ask you is something that's been on my mind since the finale of season three "B." - Ooh. - How hard was it to keep the secret that Kate was coming back? Ah, Jeff Davis and I had this discussion season one. So I knew way back, and it's hard for me to keep this big mouth shut. And I even had to lie to my friends who do watch the show. And plus, doing this show and I'm talking to everybody and everybody's like, "oh, it's so bad that she died." And I'm like... [laughter] - Like, "uh-huh!" - She didn't. Oh! But you have no idea. - Um, okay. - [Laughter] So I believe you have time for another question. I want to ask Fifth Harmony a question. Since you ladies are your own little pack, how do you think that you would fare if you were dropped into Beacon Hills? I feel like Dinah and I would definitely take the side as far as like protecting each other - and we'd probably, like, fight. - Like physically do it, right? Yeah, like physically fight off the wolves. - Yeah. - Yeah. And then I feel like Lauren, she would be, like, the strategic one. Make sure that the fighting is going the right way. They're fighting the right people. Yeah. She'd plan everything out. That kind of situation. And then Ally, she'd probably, like, cook for us in a corner. - Bake, bake, bake, bake. - She'd bake for us. - Surprise, here you go. - Find some cherries - in the woods. - Girl's got to eat, right? - Exactly. - Thanks, Mani. - And then Mila... - Thanks, Mani. Mila, I was getting to you. I see. I see how it is. She would write poems and she would sing to us. All right, Eri, awesome. Thank you so much. I love the buttons. Thank you so much. Thank you for watching the show. We love you. Love you too. - Thank you. - Bye. - All right, bye-bye. - All: Bye. Congratulations again to Eri, our Alpha of the Week. And before we wrap things up, it's time for an exclusive preview of next week's episode. - I love this part. - Ooh! - Enjoy. - Ooh. Ah! Next, on Teen Wolf... I don't want to keep watching people die. I'm not sure you have much choice about that. If you can't stop one little car, then one little Beta is going to die. Maybe we should all be running for Beacon Hills, running for our lives... [Overlapping screams] As fast as we can. [Cheers and applause] Oh, yeah. It's gonna be a good one. All right, thanks to our guests, Fifth Harmony. - [Cheers and applause] - And, as always, thank you to DJ Cole Plante. And you can keep watching the after-after show with director Jen Lynch. She's amazing. And next week, Wolf Watch is all about the mentors. Melissa Ponzio and Haley Webb will be here - to drop some knowledge on us. All: Ooh! Plus, actor Alex Saxon, who is starring in the new MTV series Finding Carter. Until then, I'm Jill Wagner reminding you to watch your back because you never know what creatures are lurking out there in the dark. - You never know. - All: Ooh! Cole, music. Yay! [Dance music] [Cheers and applause]
