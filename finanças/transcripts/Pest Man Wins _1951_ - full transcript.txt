[♪] Here you are, sir. Oh, darling, thank you so much for helping me out. Uh, pardon me. Well, Meadows, I see you've taken care of the cakes and pies. Yes, ma'am, but I can't understand why we are so overloaded with them. Well, you see, Meadows, I'm entertaining the Restaurant Owners' Association. If they like my pastries, my bakery business will increase. A very clever idea, Mrs. Castor. Uh, come along with me, and bring the cart, Meadows. Yes. They're having a party. Ah, they wouldn't hire us to exterminate pests even if they had 'em. I'm tired. Oh, me too. These cats weigh a ton. [GRUNTS] [MEOWS] Look at the blisters. All day we've been going from house to house to drum up business. And all we got was one measly little $10 job. But we caught a lot of moths and ants that we can sell to a medical lab. And all the mice we caught we can sell to a furrier that makes fur coats. I got it. Moths, mice and ants. We'll put 'em all over the house, then they'll have to hire us to exterminate them. Genius. Hey. Why didn't you think of that? Oh. Why didn't you think of it? Oh. Larry, you take charge of the ground floor. Shemp and I will climb that trellis and take care of the upstairs. Come on. [GUESTS CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] Get busy, and don't make any noise. I'll be as quiet as the mice. Moths. That must be the closet. There's a fur coat. Go to work on it. [CHUCKLES] [GUESTS CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] Shoo, shoo. Hey, Moe, I loaded the bathroom with grasshoppers, and put two frogs in the bathtub. [BABBLING] Good work. Ants. Oh, these shoes are driving me crazy. Oh, this is too bad. Oh, I can't stand it, Fifi. Hey, somebody's coming. [BONES CRUNCH] [BOTH GRUNTING] What's the matter? My hand is caught-- Come on, get going here. Oh. Get my hand out of there. All right. Under the bed, quick. [GROANING] Fifi, get me my black satin shoes. My feet are killing me. Oui, madame. That's what I get for trying to cram my foot into a 4B. Oh. Oh, my poor toes. Oh, madame, the closet, she is full with moths. CASTOR: Moths? How awful. Hurry and put my shoes on. I must tell Meadows. Hurry, Fifi. Oui, madame. There's something in there. [BOTH SCREAMING] Madame, there is mouses in the house. Oh, no. [WOMEN GASPING] Oh, you missed. Hurry, get him now. [GASPS] You missed again. Uh, quick, Fifi, my other shoe. I must have this house cleaned out immediately. If my company sees these pests, I'll be ruined. Oh, madame, you have ants. Don't get personal, Fifi. Come on. MOE: Come on, let's go. Hey-- Oh! [GRUMBLES] Oh. Watch what you're doing. Do what you're watching. Aw, come on. Let's get out of here. Oh! I didn't mean it. What happened? Oh! Oh! Hey! What do you think this is, a pinwheel? No. Come on, let's go. Oh! Oh. [SUITCASE THUDS, MOE YELLS] [MOE GROANS] Meadows, we're overrun with ants, mice and moths upstairs. And downstairs too, madame. Oh. [DOORBELL RINGS] Pardon me. You couldn't use a good exterminators? We exterminate mice, ants, moths. Oh, heaven must have sent you. The house is full of them. Meadows, dress them in clothes like our guests so they can work in the living room unobserved. And, gentlemen, they must not know what you are doing. You're a cinch. We don't know what we're doing ourselves. Heh-heh-heh! Always clowning. Oh. [GASPING] Uh, this way, gentlemen. [GASPS] [GIGGLES] [CHITTERS] Kiss me. I'm poisoned. Come on here, get out. The market's been very bad for the last two or three days. Boy, oh, boy. You know, I think this time we really ought to get rid of those mice, and I got the sure way to do it. Boy, what a beautiful place. Some day I'm gonna own a joint like this myself. Hey, try this cheese. Oh, thanks, my favorite fruit. See spots in front of your eyes? Nah. I used to see triangles. I knew it. I should have put more rat poison in there. No, you got to stuff it right-- [YELPS] [COUGHS] Why, you... Ow! Eh? Hey. CASTOR: I want the silverware put out now. The glassware, and I want Fifi to serve the drinks. And tell the chef that I want that special dressing-- Seen any mice? No, I haven't. [MEOWS] And I want-- [GASPS] Get those cats out of here quickly. [BARKS] [BARKS] Hey, mouse-y, mouse-y. Swiss cheese coming-- Hey, watch it. Pardon me. Shemp, get rid of those cats before somebody sees 'em. In here, quick. [BOTH CLEARING THROATS] [SIGHS] [GASPS THEN CHUCKLES] Oh, hello. Mr. Philander. Look, there's Tom. [SPRING BOINGS] Mouse-y. Come, mouse-y, mouse-- Shemp, hold still. Don't move. Oof! I saved your life. A mouse attacked you, and I got him with this. Right like that. Wait a minute. Oh. Oh, Shemp, I'm sorry. [BOTH GASP] [WHIMPERING] [YELLING] [STOOGES HUMMING RHYTHM] [WOMEN SCREAMING] MAN: Ouch! Ah! [WOMEN SCREAMING] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. I have just discovered that Mr. Philander is an accomplished pianist. He has graciously consented to render a selection on the piano. She say he's gonna play the piano? The cats. [PLAYING "THE BLUE DANUBE"] [CAT MEOWS "THE BLUE DANUBE"] [GUESTS CHATTERING] What was that? I didn't hear a thing. Neither did I. [CATS YOWLING] [PIANO PLAYING NOTES] Which one of you put those cats in the piano? He did. He did. [CHUCKLES] Ooh. Go on. Go on. Go on. [CATS YOWLING] [GUESTS GASP] Stupid idiot. Go on in there and get the rest of those cats. Go on. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. [CATS YOWLING, LARRY SCREAMING] LARRY: Oh, they're all out of here, Moe. I'm stuck. Get me out. Uh... Help. Take it easy, now. Easy, now. Up! Heave! [GRUNTING] LARRY: Hey! [GUESTS GASP] LARRY: Moe. Help me, I'm stuck. Okay, kid, take it easy. Come on, give me a hand. Get me out. Easy, boy. That's easy, now. Let me have a grip on you. Come on, kid. SHEMP: Forehead. Come on. Easy, now. Easy. Easy, kid. Larry, where are you? I'm right here. Help. Okay, kid. Okay. I'm all right, huh? [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Meadows, serve the refreshments quickly. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Philander. Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, refreshments are served. There are several tables. Please help yourselves. Eats! MOE: Pardon me. Boy, I'm starving. Boy, a "banquetty." Oh. Squab. Wait a minute. You gonna eat that alone? No, I'll wait. Maybe I'll get potatoes. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Wait a minute. Here's a drumstick. Thanks. Get out. Go ahead. Go on. What are you doing? Think you're playing poker? Quit stacking the deck. Oh, I'm hungry. May I serve you some punch? Certainly, and see what the boys in the back room will have. Hee-hee-hee! She's very "hospital." Certainly. Sister, pass me a piece of-- Oh. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [SIGHS] Very good you are. Come on, come on. Moe, let go. Moe, let go. [WHIMPERS] Silver. Ah, ah. Naughty, naughty. Here, you forgot these. [CLEARS THROAT] We're in the same racket, bud. Oh, oh. Why, you stupid stooge. You wanna get us thrown out of here before we get our money? Oh! Why, you-- Oh! Why, you... One of these days, I'll chew your head off. Aw, a barking dog never bites. Yeah? Ooh! Go on, get away from here. [FRUSTRATED WHINE] Oh, poppy seed cake. The poppy seeds are walkin'. Dear young man, do tell me about yourself. Well, you see, it, uh... Well, that is, uh... You'll pardon me. If you don't tell me all about this metamorphosis, I shall always feel that I've missed something. Lady, if you don't leave right now, you're not gonna miss anything. I-- Young man, what's wrong? You act as though the Sword of Damocles is hanging over your head. Lady, you must be psychic. Wonder what's wrong with that young man. [MUFFLED YELLING] [GUESTS SCREAM] [GUESTS CHATTERING] Oh. You featherbrained imbecile. Are you trying to ruin us too? [GUESTS GASP] [GUESTS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] You know, you're a little bit too bossy. Aah! Ooh. I'm too bossy, huh? Wise guy. [LAUGHING] Oof. [GUESTS GASP] [LAUGHING] You forgot to duck. Ha-ha-ha! So did you. [LAUGHING] MOE: Why, I've never heard of such a thing. No, wait. Wait, let's call a truce. Come on, now. Come on, you started this. Ha-ha-- [GUESTS GAS} [SPITS] [GUESTS SCREAM] Wait a minute, Moe. Wait. Now, look-- Your drink, madame. [GASPS] Pardon me, madame. Stop it! Stop it this minute. You disgraceful vagabonds. Oh! Oh. Ooh. So. You want to play rough, do you? Well... MOE: Wait a minute, lady. LARRY: Wait a minute. [GUESTS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] [GASPS] LARRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [GUESTS SCREAMING] I raised my rifle and fired. Naturally, the, uh-- The lions halted. But-- But you understand exactly what I'm talking about. Oh, you must be-- Larry, I apologize. This must cease! [GUESTS SCREAM] [COUGHING] Oh, well. [SCREAMS, GASPS] [CLOCK CUCKOOS] [CLOCK DRONES] Mr. Philander, I just know you're going to love my pies. Somebody's gonna get this pie right in the mush. A wise guy, eh? How do you like that? [LAUGHS] Why, you... [LAUGHING] Oh. [MOE THUDS] [CATS MEWING] [♪]
