not to stand in the re-election of the parliamentary group leadership. The reasons for this are quite simply that my health has imposed limits for me and that I'm not willing to continue above a certain level of permanent stress. 2 YEARS PREVIOUSLY... RIGHT BEFORE THE 2017 BUNDESTAG ELECTION - Good morning. - Morning. Taking the stand now is Sahra Wagenknecht for the Left Party parliamentary group. Believe it or not, we are facing a raft of 13 amendments to the Constitution. This will undermine federalism as well, and clear the path to further extensive privatization of public services. You have no idea! "No idea!" It's always "no idea". And there's Lammert sitting there, and instead of him doing something... Nothing! That's his task. Not a word. ...will see through their ploys. Your outcry shows how acclimatized you are. If one of us did that, then within a minute they'd... - There'd be disciplinary action. - Disciplinary action. - A call to order. - ...support the renovation of schools. Last week the SPD supposedly succeeded in... All of this is non-urgent, right? Wagenknecht's office, Stachel speaking, hello? Okay. No, look here. - She's due to speak in Wuppertal at 3:30. - Yes. Maybe if she gets there 15 minutes early, and the speech was at 3:45, then we'd have half an hour. And if she only speaks for half an hour... - Can we fit that in somehow? - I'm just looking. Oh! Fischi? Well, I'd say we need 15 minutes. What do you think? - I don't know. - Great. Unless it's enough for a black-yellow coalition. Then Merkel has to go black-yellow. I think she dreads doing that. That's why I think the probability of a grand coalition is high, and the SPD is seemingly really brazen. Have you ever been accused of being personally to blame for a red-red alliance failing? You know, I can't take that seriously. It's so obviously a pretext and an excuse for their new... or their realignment of policy. It's not new, but their banking on the CDU-CSU is the most likely way that they can stay in government, hence their distancing themselves. And you always put content before personality matters... What do you mean by personality matters? I'm not an unbearable person. I think I'm quite nice. I think when we sat down together, it wasn't like we wanted to scratch each other's eyes out. You just get no proper internet on this damn train. It's a black hole. I heard even in Africa, traveling through the desert, you got internet. Even in Estonia, every bus, everywhere, you get Wi-Fi, it's absolutely brilliant. "Sahra, I want to have a baby with you." Stuff like that. That's how it's been. That was in 2013. That's how it was at the start. Not now, but it's grown incredibly. There are ratings of how well-known people are, and at over 80 percent, Sahra is right up there. There are few politicians who are that well-known. And then it's really this pop star aspect that gets added to the mix. It's... I wouldn't like to trade places with the Federal Criminal Police this year, because they really have to work to earn their money. Everybody knows one of the main problems facing families in this country, which is that in most big cities, at least in inner-city areas, people simply can't find affordable homes. Then they're surprised as ever more people don't feel represented by their politics and turn their backs on their policies. That is exactly their arrogance. You could have stayed another half-hour. Yes, yes. If it wasn't so tight with all the appointments, I'd have done more. People are always so glad. If we go straight there, it's 56 km. Yes. And I'd get there on time. Surprise... Yes? Hello? Oskar? Wait a moment. I'll hand you over to Sahra. How did you get on in Wuppertal? There were thousands. I got on really well in Bielefeld, too. It was a bit bigger again. I'll message you in a minute. See you later. Bye. Well, not exactly nervous... But you are always a bit tense. Actually more so with Bundestag speeches, to be honest. I don't know why. Probably because I'm still quite new to it. Or at least with Bundestag speeches where you're replying to the Chancellor. The tension is greater then. You're worried that... Sometimes you make stupid slips of the tongue, and everyone hears about it if you make a slip of the tongue that's particularly funny or stupid. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Mia. Hello. Glad you could make the time. When you were young, you didn't want to go to kindergarten. Why not? Well, for one thing, in those days I was a bit of an outsider at kindergarten. I grew up in the GDR and there were relatively few children who were darker. I stood out and I was bullied by other kids, who said, "She looks strange." So I felt a bit ostracized, and then I started to read at a young age. I learned to read at four and I used to love staying home, reading books. I found it so interesting. It fascinated me much more than kindergarten, where we played in the sandbox or whatever. ...to provide pensions, to regulate the labor market. In theory, that would classically be the SPD. Much of what we demand used to be the SPD position, but they have substantially moved away from that. When I entered politics, I thought I had to go on TV and make good arguments to the public. I was convinced that if my arguments were better, then viewers would realize that. And then they'd all be convinced. Then you also learn that besides the arguments, there's a whole other level. Everything you say is filtered through the world view that you're talking to. And if the Left isn't considered an acceptable party in that world view, then you can make 100 good arguments, and you still won't get through, your point still won't be heard. For example, when I say we have to tax the super-rich, people who own a small house may seriously believe I might have meant them, and are afraid they won't be able to bequeath their house or that they'll have to pay vast inheritance tax. These are really problems where I realize that the public discourse and what gets said about us sometimes has a far greater effect than what we say ourselves. - All wet? - It looks wet. Well, just a bit. I hope the thing holds up. Yes, yes. Sure. We'll have to see who does the panel debate, and so on. Or do you have any... - I think... - I'll do it. I think Sahra wants to do it, and we'll have to see... Yes, I mean who is going to do the election campaign? I mean... Yes, but you'll have to discuss it with Sahra, because Sahra wants to do it. You'll have to discuss that with Sahra. Because it's not just the party leaders. There are other people, too. Shit, there's a bad connection in Franconia. - Can you still hear me? - No, he's gone. Yes. And what about that press conference? As far as I'm concerned, the logic would be that four of us do it, because, if we have to do it, the party leaders and the two of us go into the Federal Press Conference. Of course I would prefer it if you two do the Federal Press Conference, but they said they insist on going. Then they should do it alone. I'm starting to find this... Yes, it's... Hmm. It's unbelievable. And I wish you lots of strength for the future, and I hope you become Chancellor. We'll see! Thank you. Can I give you m y bag? Sahra, please come on up to us. Politics can always finance what it wants to finance. And what it doesn't finance, rotting schools, poorly-equipped care homes, it doesn't want to finance that. It has no interest in doing so. And that is a problem. Look at the arms manufacturers who make substantial donations not only to the CDU and FDP, but also to the SPD and now even the Greens in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. That is something I'd call corrupt politics. So, ladies and gentlemen, now I would just like... to inform you very briefly, since m y time is almost up, that we... I mean m y allotted speaking slot. It's... My God! How far have we come? How far have we come? Come on, everyone. The election is still a few days away. Let's let this successful government work, at least today. You could have ensured that the minimum wage is more than a poverty wage, which the tax payer subsidizes to the tune of 10 billion euros every year via unemployment benefits. - Just park for a second by the office. - A stopover... Yes, exactly. You can take a seat here. You have an interview marathon today. It's like that at the moment. It always is in Berlin, because when I'm traveling the country I can't make many of these appointments. So we squeezed them all into these few days. We'll start with a very unpolitical question. Puree or mash? How do you make your potato soup? One second. Okay. Let's go over there. - Have a picnic? - Yeah, I'm not sure what I should do. The whole set-up is stupid. I seriously wouldn't do it. Yeah, they want... I mean what's that gold thing? Yeah, the whole thing's crap. She's not with us. We're going up in a minute. And anyway, time-wise... Look at the time. - I think it's... - What were they thinking? I mean, I have some slight concerns... - Must it really be staged like this? - It would be nice. Quite honestly, I find it a bit... I'll be quite honest. It's a bit, a bit... Contrived. Sitting on a blanket, reading Goethe... I'm really not sure. Well, it's an entertainment format for the magazine "Bunte". I know it can't be too far from political events, but we have to be visually different than existing photos, because... - The ones you just took were lovely. - I think so, too. But as I said... There isn't even any red wine. Yeah, we should have thought of that, huh? - Let's see how it looks first. - Yes, let's take a look, and then... Ultimately, the shots need approval. And if you're not happy with the scene... I mean, the problem is you don't have a picnic dressed like this. Flat pumps, short skirt... - I'd say it seems... - Yes. And with the Bundestag in the background, they'll think I'm mad. It's a bit off-the-wall, but I think people will realize it's not a daily situation for you. But if you're not comfortable with it, I can... I'll speak to the journalist who's doing the interview, and do some shots upstairs. And then we'll think about what we can do that's authentically non-political. But which isn't quite so off-the-wall. - All right? - Yes. I'll be right with you. We'll take the "through the bottom" option. - Right? - Yes. Do we... Oh, down here! Right. Do we go here? I don't know where we have to go. Over there... Oh, God! It's okay. It is coming from the left. The rain's coming from the left. - I'll give you m y jacket. - Thank you. Thanks. This one often gets stuck. It would be relaxing, if it got stuck. - It wouldn't be so bad. - No. We wouldn't let anyone in. - Hello. - Hi. So, Wolfgang, a parliamentary group without you is something we'll have to get used to. I have always really enjoyed working with you. I think we've had a very, very long period in which we've worked together closely, until now, until today. And so what I wish for... A flyer has been distributed saying "One red is leaving, but red remains." Wolfgang, I wish you weren't going, that you were staying, staying with us in the political battle, staying to fight on together with us and battle through. And many thanks for all you have done. Thank you. And I'm sorry that I have to go now. Thank you. So was it actually tight with... - It all got done. - Okay, but... A day that everyone said wouldn't work. But everything's worked so far. Oh, shit. It's packed. Look what's going on here. They're all on m y spot, where I wanted to park. Holy moly! What's going on here? I get out now, you have to wait until they open the door. - Alright - The BOTS are playing, right? - Yes, yes. - It's not Dietrich... - Right then. - Okay. A big applause to Dr. Sahra Wagenknecht Sahra, we love you! WE DEMAND A MERKEL-WAGENKNECHT TV DUEL The fact that there is longing, great longing even, for new policy, I think we saw this when Martin Schulz was nominated. I mean, why did the SPD suddenly rocket in the polls, like a comet? In my opinion, the reason was that very many people were hoping that the SPD wouldn't only change their candidate for Chancellor, but would also change their policies, that they would finally return to social-democracy politics, and not agenda-politics. Policies for their own voters. For workers, pensioners and the unemployed. So on September 24, give your vote to the Left Party. Thank you. I wish you the best. Sahra, we love you! It was so good! Many thanks, Sahra. You give us hope! Keep going! No, no. And what you hear, in the background, and what people tell me is that even Wagenknecht opponents are impressed, that the election campaign she's running is really sensational. I mean, think about it. 3,500 people turned out in Nuremberg. That's more than the Chancellor gets in some places. And Wagenknecht didn't get jeered or pelted with tomatoes. On the contrary. As I said, I'm quite optimistic. But the stupid thing about all this is... that I think the far-right will really make big gains again. It's 5 p.m. Oh, shit. Now our election program. This election is interesting. For the very the first time, a party with far-right members, the AfD, could be voted into the Bundestag. So there's a lot we have to discuss. Hello. We have one minute to go until the first forecasts are due. I say we take a look at the picture. CDU 26.5%. CSU 6.0%. Together 32.5%. - Oh, what? 20! - The SPD is down to 20%. That's the SPD's worst ever result. It's the CDUs worst since 1949, and also the CSU's worst. - The Left 9%. - Yes! The Greens 9.5%. The FDP have 10.5% and remain in the Bundestag. And the AfD, as I said, look likely to have 13.5%. Oh, shit! You must be kidding! Dear friends, Sahra is ready to step up. I'd like you to give her a big, big round of applause. She has achieved so much in the last few weeks. She contributed so much to this great result for us. So a big round of applause, please, for Sahra Wagenknecht. We all fought hard. So I'd like to give a big "thank you" to all of you. Because without you, we'd never have achieved this. The Left's celebrations are more muted. This will probably be their second-best result ever, but they've lost their place as third party in the Bundestag, and, of all parties, to the AfD, so the mood is pensive with the party's Chancellor candidate. My concern is that we've lost ground to the AfD in the former East. Of course we have to ask ourselves critically, where did we make certain things too easy? But at the end of the day, all three smaller parties suffered the same fate. They all lie behind the AfD. So, come on. What will happen to Schulz now? He'll go. I can't imagine he'll be re-elected as party leader. No? Sahra, I have to say, you're... You don't need to be sad. We got a fantastic result. Yes, I'm feeling really bad. It's got nothing to do with the result. I would even if we'd got 10%. All I'd say is... Oh, well. Hey, you know... - Let's wait for the official result. - Yes, we should both wait. I'm going to write a few letters. We could have done better, if we hadn't so much internal trouble. That is true. That's true. Especially if we'd all pulled together. - I have to call m y mother. - Yes, I was going to say. Hello. We've been in the car for a while. I had to watch something beforehand. I reckon we should be there by ten past at the latest. Yeah, I've got a bad cold. No? Oh, well. Okay. See you later. Bye. - Ten past. - That's what I told her. - I reckon. - Half an hour? Dietmar, is that right? I'd say a bit less, unless we run into traffic somewhere. Someone drew a Hitler moustache on Merkel. That's mean. Of course we have to think about why we lost so many votes, and we're talking about 430,000, to the AfD, which shows that the theory that there's no overlap in the voter spectrum is obviously not true. At least there is in the East. How is all the infighting for you? Will battle lines be drawn around this election result, which, at least in the East, is dramatically poor? Well, we won a total of over half a million extra votes. It was the second-best result in our party's history. Yes, that was primarily in the West, but you have to acknowledge we had unparalleled good results there. Were it not for the losses in the East, we'd be in double figures, What we have to do now, hopefully without any infighting, is think seriously about how to position ourselves in the East to win those people back. Ms. Wagenknecht, I'm Szent-Ivanyi, the Federal Press Conference chairman. - Hello. - Hello. Your AfD colleagues are still sitting upstairs. They're running late, are they? We're already finished, but... Have them come past us. Ms. Kipping, there's a rumor in circulation or going around, that you'll run for the parliamentary group chair, or could, or want to, or whatever... Can you comment on that? Thank you for your question, Mr. Decker. This rumor, which has featured in several articles in a very particular way, shows that spreading fake news isn't an invention of the political right. Some articles gave me the impression there's an enthusiasm for women's mud-wrestling, which individuals project onto what goes on in a political party. I can only say, if there was any dispute in the Left, it was only a dispute in terms of policy, but it was not the fight for a post, and let me say very clearly, this rumor is completely unfounded. In your opinion, will the party line-up remain the same as you have at the moment? I can answer for the parliamentary group, which is meeting mid-October, and it will elect its leadership there. People aren't appointed in the Left Party, they are elected, and the leadership will be whatever the parliamentary group decides. As for the party leader, that will be decided at the next party convention. But regarding immediate resignations, at least with the good result we achieved, there is no reason for that. We will have to get to grips with how to deal with the AfD. We will look at how to build on our position. But as for debating who makes up the party leadership, we have no reason to. At the party executive committee the day after the election, I was told I'd driven voters away. And I don't mean to complain, I mean election campaigning is what it is, but it was really... I was at the limit of my capacities, health-wise and physically. I was really shattered. It was incredibly exhausting. And then, after working to the point of exhaustion for six weeks, having to hear that I'd driven voters away, which, given the election results, is a difficult conclusion to reach, isn't... that wasn't very motivating. You have to know that Sahra Wagenknecht and I did not have a lifelong bottom political relationship. We were opponents within a party, opponents who, even when we had very differing political views, at least always treated each other fairly. I'd say that about myself, and the same about Sahra. But politically, we were the furthest far apart. We don't see everything the same way today. We still have differences in political matters. I find that normal. But we have a basis of trust, where we both know and can rely on the fact that certain things are done, and certain things aren't. That's how it works in politics. She certainly imparted that, but not completely to the party leadership. And that has to do with our predecessor. I mean Gregor Gysi dominated things to an extreme extent. And Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger didn't want that domination again. For there to be parliamentary group people who dominate. Subjectively, I can understand that. And I say, yes, in the end we have a different task. Society does not see us in such a way that everyone says, "Great group, they have to govern here and be given more responsibility." And if this is true, then we should focus the debates we have on questions of policy. What's it about? "Is Sahra Wagenknecht being bullied in the Left Party?" "Unfortunately Sahra cannot be stopped as chair of the parliamentary group. You can't just shoot her down. Sahra must be given the push, and we are working on that. If we keep on dressing her down and she realizes that her positions are gaining no traction, she's bound to leave of her own accord." Well, well. - Ms. Kipping? - Not now. No comment. The parliamentary group is in a closed meeting. They're all in Potsdam. Mr. Riexinger, good morning. Can you give us a quick sound bite? - We need a quick meeting first. - Yes, yes. Yes, we'll be having discussions. That's all there is to say. Were you misquoted in "Bild" newspaper with what you said about Ms. Wagenknecht? - Bernd, are you coming? - Yes, there's no truth in it. That's clear. How burnt is the bridge between you? Even if he denies saying that about you, the way the situation looks from the outside, it's because you're mutually wearing each other down. That would fit... I wouldn't say it's mutual. We haven't tabled any motions to disempower the party chairs. It's very one-sided. So, dear comrades, a very warm welcome to our parliamentary group conference here in Potsdam. Thanks for the great attention from the media, who I would now say goodbye to. Katja Kipping is clearly vying for power. Many in the party have said the party leadership isn't enough for her, she wants to be rid of Sahra Wagenknecht, as I hear from the party, hence all these motions, as it's clear, as Sahra Wagenknecht openly says, that if these motions, if one of these motions is passed, she will leave, and with her Dietmar Bartsch. Neither of them will stand. In real life, in private enterprise, you always take people who are good, they're first in line, but in politics, sadly it seems a bit different. So there are still debates going on. And that's bad enough. How is it in politics? No comment. Bye. I have to make a real assessment. If he's a better driver than me, I appreciate that he's a better driver. - And I am! - So? Yes. It can be like that. It must also be possible for politicians to say, "I reach more people. My strengths lie here and there." So go with that and say, "Show your face. You can convince people." "They'll come to you." Fantastic! The other person can't do that, so they have to find a different field. And this doesn't mean they have to oppose each other. It's so stupid, isn't it? Could you just... A very warm welcome... Bernd, this is the parliamentary group press conference, so a warm welcome from me, too. We've had a parliamentary group meeting, a very successful and contentious one. Dietmar Bartsch and I are both glad that we've been elected by a clear margin. We have taken up some initial positions in the parliamentary group executive. Fortunately we have also resolved several disputes. I think there's a clear majority in the parliamentary group who think the debates that we've had should be brought to an end. - Bye. - Bye. I have to say, this happens in all parties. The news coverage sometimes made it seem it's only in the Left. I think it's something that puts people off getting into politics. People with ideals, who'd like to make a difference, but who feel they'd prefer not to have to jump into such a snake pit. And that's something that doesn't necessarily improve the quality of the political workforce. - Hello. - Excuse me. Yes, exactly, that was... a conversation with the president of Moldova. - Ah, okay. Fine. - If you need any more details... - No, that's enough. Have a nice day. - Okay. Great. Listen, no, I'm not discussing that with you. "Marriage for all" is right the way it is. No, seriously. No. No, I don't want to discuss it anymore. "Marriage for all" is right and good. No. I don't understand, and I won't discuss it any further. Goodbye. Bye. It's very quiet here in the building at the moment. I mean, appointments, especially with her personally... There are always appointments and she always attends events, but politically... it's very quiet here in the Bundestag. And throughout the republic, I'd say. Yeah. I'll speak to him. I'll get back to you in the next 30 to 45 minutes. You're welcome. Speak soon. Bye. You know? The perfidious thing is, he started a shitstorm yesterday evening. He sent out his tweet. It went on till I went to bed, and it carried on this morning. What do you mean, shitstorm? Michael Schlick, the press officer, blah blah blah... puts the "Frankfurter Rundschau" close to the North Korean party newspaper, "Rodong Sinmun". Sahra Wagenknecht commented that... You know? - Hello. - Hi. We hope that next year, whatever the outcome of the talks on forming a coalition, there will be more pressure in this country for fairer conditions, for better pensions for better care services and better education. The Left is the social opposition in the Bundestag, and we will uphold that. And so that we have the strength for this, all members of parliament from the Left are also looking forward to enjoying Christmas and resting. And you should do that, too, so that next year, together, we can fight for more social security and a better country. Well, I couldn't think of much more to say about Christmas. - How long was it? - Let me have a look... - Yes, that's okay. - 56 seconds. - We can use it for Instagram, too. Good. - Yeah? 56. - Right, we're done then. - Yes. - Thanks a lot. Bye. - Bye. We're at a bit of an impasse right now. The Left got a great result, sure, but not even close to a majority. And actually we need a broader reach. There ought to be a movement where people stand up for themselves, where they go on demos opposing certain things. And I feel the potential is there. A lot of young people are worried. They don't want to end up living in a country that curtails civil liberties, because right-wingers are in government, and which also become less social. So, there's a potential, but it's not... It's not active, it's still sleeping. What do you think of Rosa Luxemburg? She was a feisty woman. But I don't know if... Well, no... I'm not going to risk my neck. Yes, she's the role model for the Left all around the world. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Ah, morning! Still at it. Hello. Happy New Year! Hello, m y friend. The shift to the right is the biggest challenge facing not only Germany, as it was also a big challenge in France. I can see m y friend Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. - Welcome! - I'm glad you're here, Jean-Luc. And also that you led such an outstanding fight against the right wing in France. A very warm welcome. All left-leaning people in Germany must come together to keep the right in check. We must not repeat the mistakes of history again. This is not only a challenge to the Left Party alone. My observation is directed primarily... Sorry, I was Chairman of the SPD. They were directed at the SPD. And I don't want to look on as the SPD continues to go down the drain. We also need people from the SPD who will work with us. That is the point of all this discussion. They must not enter into a Grand Coalition again, and then end up with 15%. That isn't enough to stop the right wing in Germany. Morning. Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. Yes, most people are probably glad a government has been formed at all, and are saying it doesn't really matter who is forming it, pretty much. The result is about to be announced. She's not going to be here, right? Yes, she should be. - She should hurry up. - What did Jan say? Jan's taking a break, then it's the announcement in a moment. That would be good. Are you excited about how it might go? - No? Yes? - No. I'm totally excited. I'm getting a new iPhone today. So happy about that. The break hasn't ended yet. - Yes, but it can start any minute. - Any minute... - Let's go then. - Let's go, you can find a seat. - See you later. - See you later. Right... They could start the announcement any minute. Do you want to be in there? Yes, but they have to do the count first. - They've been counting the whole time. - They've made all the calls? Yes, of course. I thought the vote would take at least an hour. I thought so, too, but it's not like that. Apparently they were quick today. What did you think of last night? - We should do that more regularly. - Yes, yes, definitely. There's the bell. Does the bell mean they're resuming? Or is it just for fun? Ringing just for fun! No, it's been ringing the whole time, that's why I wasn't sure. Ringing could mean something is ending. Yes, they're all going in now. Come back here afterwards. Thanks. Once you've taken your seats, I'd like to resume our paused session. I bring us to item two on the agenda, the oath taken by the Federal Chancellor. Federal Chancellor, I have in my hands the original copy of our Constitution. Can I please ask you to take the oath of office laid out in Article 56? "I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the German people, promote their welfare, protect them from harm, uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws of the Federation, perform m y duties conscientiously and do justice to all. So help me God." Federal Chancellor, allow me to express m y best wishes for the difficult path ahead of you. This hasn't been a good day for our country. We will be the social opposition here in the Bundestag and work towards different politics becoming possible here and in Europe. Wow. What a sensational statement! - Hello, Ms. Wagenknecht. - Hello. - Lewinsky, we arranged to meet. - Ah, okay. To achieve that, doesn't the Left have to appear more unified? Yes, that would be very desirable. Ms. Wagenknecht, thanks for joining us. Now back to Bettina Schausten. Thank you. Okay, which side then? Where the restaurant is or the other side? You're beside the benches. I'm standing there, too, on the phone. Yoo-hoo. Can't she see me? I'm so bright today. No... Then you're in the wrong place. You're in the west lobby, right, and not where the restaurant is? We'll come to the east lobby. Please wait in the east lobby. No, the east lobby is where there are no members of the press. All members of the press are in the west lobby. Right, so the east lobby is... Opposite the west is the east, and that's where we'll be. Exactly. Thanks. Bye. ...said we weren't there, so I told her that... Yeah. 32nd SESSION OF THE GERMAN BUNDESTAG I declare the session open. For today's debates we have decided on a total allotted time of eight hours. First to speak will be the leader of the AfD parliamentary group, Dr. Alice Weidel. Germany has long since become a borderless land of immigration for unqualified people and a land of emigration for the highly-qualified. And what are you doing about it? Who is to pay for pensions in the future? Who will pay for your state pensions? Yours too, Mr. Hofreiter, complaining so vocally. Yeah? Your gold-nugget immigrants? You don't seriously believe that! I can tell you: burkas, headscarf-girls, men with knives on welfare, and other good-for-nothings will not safeguard our Germany, its economic growth and above all the welfare state. If you live in a country where you are punished for fishing without a permit, but not for crossing borders illegally without a valid passport, then you are fully entitled to say this country is governed by idiots. Colleague Ms. Weidel, in your speech you used, among other things, the terms "headscarf-girls" and "other good-for-nothings". In doing so, you discriminate against all women who wear a headscarf. For that, I call you to order. Dear colleagues, good morning. We don't need any... Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear to everyone that the figures for the 2018 budget and for the associated mid-term financial planning are very positive once again. This is extremely pleasing. I find it irresponsible. You heard the sort of inflammatory speeches now being made in the Bundestag. Speeches in which people are pitted against one another and are disparaged. The fact that such speeches have become possible in the Bundestag is the result of her policies. And she isn't even considering changing these policies. And she isn't even considering changing these policies. I find it totally exasperating. This cannot go on. Well that covers everything, as far as I'm concerned. If there's anything you'd like to add, then... Thank you, but no. By the way, what's it like speaking after the AfD? It can't be a great feeling, can it? No, because with their belligerent manner they dominate the debate and often the others tend to rise to it a bit. For example, I don't think it's effective when you... I mean, of course you can heckle, but trying to shout them down is more an endorsement of the AfD. Is my position okay? Sitting up straight. All right. What's the greatest challenge for German migrant policy in 2018? Migrants didn't bring these problems. We already had a shortage of social housing and day-care centers. Schools were overstretched in inner cities. That was already the case. But it has deteriorated, of course. Mrs. Merkel is letting it all continue and by doing so, she creates sentiments that the AfD profits from. This is very dangerous, and it must change. - Like so? - Yes. Is that okay with the light? - Maybe we're better like this. - No, the window. - You're all laughing. Why? - You'll be laughing too in a moment. I don't laugh about interview partners. Hello. Hello. - I'm so glad you took the time. - Gladly. It was a very original request. Yes, true. And I don't want to start a MeToo thing, but that's a great outfit. Thank you. Yours is very original. I can return the compliment. - Where shall we go? - In here, I'd say. - How has your day been so far? - Oh! Tiring. To give you an honest answer. It's been... Well, this morning was the general debate. And then it was just one appointment after another. But just the usual kind of interviews. - What's the usual? - The normal political ones. No one has asked about art and paintings. Finally we can do that now. I'll hit record, if that's okay with you. I'll just do that... What do you feel when you look at that painting? It's an abstraction of Mount Ventoux. You asked about art in the office, and I admit that the other art... We get it through the Bundestag. You have to hang something in your office. This is the only picture that I have a direct connection with. And it's hung here, because, with all this stress, I need it. When I'm tired or flagging and look at this picture, it has something... It makes me feel better. This is the one personal picture. Is it because it also fascinates you? Because Mt. Ventoux is an... Opponent sounds too hard, but of course as a cyclist, it's a pretty serious thing, isn't it? Yes, yes. It's... I've ridden up a few times. It's a matter of willpower, especially the route from BÃ©doin, the ascent is really tough. It's really hard and once you're at the bottom, you really feel you've dug deep. But you get a big reward. Or at least when the weather is nice. The view is fantastic from up there. And these are works of art that nature has painted that you can't reproduce. Or that you can't reproduce more beautifully. - Hello. Good morning. - Hi, Sahra. We're going to speak to ARD for the eight o'clock news. - Somewhere here. - Okay. Make-up is over there, we'll go there first. Then I'll check the file where the ZDF thing is, and you can wait. Hello. "SUPERillu" is running a cover story today which names no sources, but says that you are considering some form of response after the party convention as a consequence of the debate on migrant policy. Can you comment on that? No, that's pure speculation. - There's no truth in it? - No, there's no truth in it. I don't know what's given you the idea. There are aren't many quotes in it, or sources. None actually. Thank you. Let's go to ZDF now. Did you deny that about "SUPERillu"? No, I said it was really absolute insider knowledge... I'm very surprised, and wonder how "SUPERillu" knew. All parties discuss migrant policy and no party has taken conclusive positions, so this debate will not be over after the party convention. I find it encouraging that the wording "open borders for all" no longer features in the main proposal, because it is a completely unrealistic demand. You've been described by some party members as taking a right-wing position. Will you continue to advocate this position publicly, will you reiterate it? Yes, of course. I feel that within the Left many people see that we have to defend the right to asylum for the persecuted. There have to be open borders for victims of persecution. And that we cannot go on saying anyone who wants can come to Germany and has the right to welfare and can look for work, because it leads to such upheaval, to pressure on wages, and to problems that the poorest have to pay for. I must go, or I'll be told yet again that I ignore the chairpersons. Not by me! I know it was me who kept you here. Okay, see you later. Bye. Following the months of debate on our migrant policy, we need to clarify our policy at this party convention so that we know what the party stands for. And I call on all of us to then accept that clarification. And at this juncture I'd like to address Oskar Lafontaine personally. After this party convention, there has to be an end to... to this party's democratically-adopted migrant policy constantly being publicly questioned. And I ask you to put an end to the attacks on us chairpersons for advocating this policy position. For many observers, it seems as if the parliamentary group and the party leadership were in conflict over fundamental core issues. What are we dealing with? To be crystal clear about it, an ideological masking of power issues, and an often bigoted one at that, dear comrades. So we have to put an end to it. We have to put an end to it. We will not resolve these conflicts by calling each other racists, nationalists or neo-liberal simpletons. We have to put an end to it! We have to put an end to it! It's destructive poison for a left-wing party, dear comrades. SHORT BREAK Phoenix is broadcasting your speech between 1 and 2 p.m. Okay. Great. And you'll be speaking on time, more or less, so it's all fine. So, time to have your photo taken. I don't expect everyone to share m y opinion. Of course not. But what I do expect is solidarity in our discussions. And if I and other comrades are accused by our own ranks of nationalism, racism or being close to the AfD, or if it is alleged we are caving in to the right-wing zeitgeist, then that is the opposite of solidarity in our discussions. Because we're not here to serve our own ends. We're trying to change this country, and I'm convinced that we can change it. So let's end the infighting. Let's work together and transform the conditions that every day cause the anger and the hatred that has made the brown-shirt womb fertile again. Let's fight for this land, and not leave it to the AfD's Gaulands and HÃ¶ckes. I would like to fight for that alongside you. That is our task. If we take it up, we will be successful. Thank you very much. Thank you, Sahra. Our rules stipulate that up to three questions can be asked after each speech. I've been notified of one question. From Sabine Leidig on microphone 4. One minute, Sabine. Thank you, Sahra, for the points that you made. You quite rightly said that all positions must be discussed, including our position on migration issues. I'd like to ask you why you haven't offered your position up for debate here at the convention, in order that we reach a conclusion. Dear... Dear Sabine... Stop! Excuse me, excuse me! Is it okay if we have all the questions first? Or do you want to answer now? I saw one other microphone. Sahra, last year when there were some attempted terror attacks in Germany, you claimed there's a link between immigration and terror attacks. I'd like to ask you if you genuinely see this link or if you think that claiming there is such a link is grist to the mill of the wrong forces in this republic. In not permitting any debates for months now, you are fragmenting this party. You ignore the positions taken by the majority of this party. And you have just... And you have just done it again. It is beyond belief. And I am not willing to accept it any longer. I expect of you that you respect the positions of this party. I would like to know what you think refugees are. You talk of war refugees. What other refugees are there in your eyes? Do you talk of economic refugees? Dear Elke, of course we can discuss the matter. And I've just... I'm not preventing any discussions. On the contrary. I want factual discussion. I'm trying to contribute to the discussion with m y speeches. Of course it's an emotional subject. Yes. And there are millions of people living in parts of the world that are blighted and I want the focus of the discussion to be that we have to help there, that we have to change our foreign policy. And if that gets booed, then I have to say for me it's not social justice, if that isn't the focus of our debate. So, many thanks. I can see a point of order request at microphone 5. If you please... What is happening here? I want to ask a question. As someone who came here in the 1990s as the daughter of refugees, I'd like to express my gratitude to Sahra for reaching a clientele that we can't reach, specifically in order to highlight this refugee problem. And doing it that way, that repulsive, scheming way... So, please excuse me, but that is an abuse of our points of order. I'm rather surprised by the aggression that was suddenly shown in response to Sahra Wagenknecht's speech. Dear Elke Breitenbach, how many refugees in Berlin have been deported in the last three years? I've heard it's over 1,000. Where is the outcry about that? I don't hear it. Katja Kipping made a speech at the Institute for Economic Research, where she said that people who come to Germany should have a year's trial period, and leave if they fail. It was called "social anchor points". Where was the outcry? I didn't hear it. And on the subject of what causes people to flee we're talking about causes, and addressing the causes. And I don't hear any of that from those of us here who constantly raise the issue of migration and refugees as a moral one. Yes, they're kind of sick in the head. They should get some help from the nice doctor. Would you have found it helpful if the party chairman had shaken your hand or hugged you after the speech? I don't want to ask too much of anyone. We should discuss things together objectively. People don't have to love each other in a party. I'm sure that applies to many parties, but we should treat each other in a spirit of solidarity, especially as the Left, who always set great store by solidarity. So, thank you. And now, dear comrades, let's conclude the traditional way, looking ahead, by singing "The Internationale" together to bring this convention to a close. Arise, ye prisoners of starvation Arise, ye wretched of the earth For justice thunders condemnation A better world's in birth. No more tradition's chains shall bind us Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall So, that's it for today. The earth shall rise on new foundations We have been nought, we shall be all 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The international working class Shall be the human race About this movement, are you afraid, though maybe "afraid" is the wrong word, of alienating your own people? I don't think so. Like most parties, the Left also has the usual power struggles and rivalries, and we've tried to use that to get the party motivated, for instance about me doing m y own thing or opening m y own office, or whatever it was that was said. Maybe that unsettled a few people. But I think that once we have a public presence at the latest, everyone will see what the project is, and I think a lot of people will join in, because they think it's sensible. That's the amazing thing. I mean, the movement doesn't actually exist yet and since we went public about it, Oskar first announced it in public, then I gave a few details, and since then I've been getting several emails a day, some days ten or more, with people asking to please notify them of when the launch will be, and saying they would definitely join in. Morning, everyone. Hello. It's pretty full. It's all happening here! - Hello. - Hello. - Morning. - Hello. The search for a name took a long time, and so we tried to narrow it down. We have your favorite, "Unsere Stimme". Maybe Hans can say a few words about that. "Unsere Stimme" movement for new politics in Germany. It's relatively strong. It all sounds like a very central plea, but you've made a fantastic suggestion with that. Still, I'd like to be fair about this, because some people don't like the name, for understandable reasons. So we should take the various alternatives that we still have on the table and at least weigh them up in discussion and then make a majority decision. The abbreviation of "Unsere Stimme", "US", I don't think it works. It sounds... Yes, but it will be abbreviated, and we have to think about that now. - That's the good guys. - And... And it sounds to me too much like our time from the Communist Party Spectrum. I suggested "Aufbruch", in the sense of "setting forth" Or "Aufstehen", as in "stand up". Both have the upwards dynamic of "auf". They're not overbearing, they describe what we want. That people become active for their own interests. But Sahra thought that was stale. But... No, it's just that there are so many movements with names like that. On the other hand, what I thought was excellent... The moment Ida told me it today, I thought it was a bottom name, that we can also be creative with visually, "Ahoi". - "Ahoi"? - Yes! I think it's great. It's totally positive. Encouraging. Friendly. "Ahoi" is a bit like setting sail, setting your bearing, and I think "Ahoi" is great. I didn't know about that. I love "Ahoi". It's beguilingly light. It's a very, very constructive surprise. You hear "Ahoi" and... - It's totally fresh. - I think so, too. It is so cool. Of course, it does still need a descriptor, so it doesn't sound like a fizzy drink. Adolf Hitler. AH. I'm looking through all the abbreviations in Wikipedia to see what there is. - What was that? Adolf Hitler? - Adolf Hitler. We must always check. With "180" I thought the one-eight is also Adolf Hitler. And I said, "For God's sake, not those numbers!" You get so many evil misinterpretations. But in this case, the leap from "Ahoi" to Hitler... There's a fine line between charmingly crazy and ridiculous. It's a very fine line. We have to look into which way it's going to go. I think "Ahoi" doesn't tick the box as something to be taken seriously, unlike the others. What Fabi just said was that we still need the upwards-and-onwards "Aufbruch" people. The positive forward-looking ones. - Can I just make a point? - Yes. Because it's on my mind right now. "Aufwachen" was one. "Aufbruch" was the other. If we combine that with the most important word in the French national anthem, which is very revolutionary. The first word. "Auf". "Auf". - Just "Auf". - "Auf". - "Auf". - "Auf". This very simple "Auf". It can be a prefix for so many things. As "up", it has something positive and simple. Where you just say... So not "auf" with anything else, just "auf" on its own? - Yes. "Auf". - "Up front". - "Up-wards". - Yes? - It's great. You can do so much. The second thing is "auf" in the sense of "open". So what do we have? I have to go down in a minute. Only me, you'll all still be here. Was there anything else I can help to decide? Bye, then. Sorry, but he's an important colleague. - Hello. - Have you been waiting? - Yes. - I didn't mean to hold you all up. - Hello. - Hello. Let's go in then. I said you should go in with Oskar, so you don't need to wait. - Yes. - Hello. We changed the country in 1989. And in 2019, 30 years later, I call on you to put your cross in the right box, so that we can get this thing going in a democratic, orderly way. AfD YOUR VOTE! MARSHAL Disgusting! This brown mob... disgusting! CHEMNITZ IS NEITHER GRAY NOR BROWN FOR THE TIMES ARE NOW CHANGING #AUFSTEHEN -THE COLLECTIVE MOVEMENT FOR TIMES ARE CHANGING NOW BECOME PART OF THE MOVEMENT Ladies and gentlemen, today we'd like to present to you the "Aufstehen" movement. If we had still needed any prompt to do this, then I think most recently the events in Chemnitz have clearly demonstrated that things cannot continue like this and that we urgently need a new political impetus. What we are experiencing in Germany is a major crisis of democracy. My name is Simone Lange and I'm here today not as mayor, but as a mother. I want m y daughters to have a peaceful future in a liberal democracy. This has induced me to support this initiative and to seek the common ground that transcends parties. And to put an end to the situation, where parties that are naturally similar, like the SPD, the Greens and the Left, publicly make life hard for each other and insult each other. Above all, we want to appeal to people with no party affiliation or who are members of a party, be that of the SPD, the Greens or the Left. If we founded a new party, these people would be faced with the prospect of leaving their organization. So that would be divisive. We can unite, as everyone can join us. Ludger, I just want to say goodbye. See you this evening. - See you this evening. - We'll talk then. I have to rush again... I'll see you this evening, too. Hello. Where's Simone? I have to say goodbye to her. - At the table. - Will you be at the live chat? Yes, yes. Right, I'll be at the live chat in a minute. I heard our site crashed due to too many hits. Too many hits. Oops. - Well, it could be worse. - Let's speak in the next few days. - Sure. - Definitely. - See you. - See you. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Is the sound okay? - Let's wait for the wind to drop. We'll wait a moment for the gust of wind to pass. We're nearly done. Might the Left now say Sahra Wagenknecht doesn't fit anymore due to Aufstehen? Is that possible? I can't imagine that, because many members of the Left are involved. As well as SPD members, in great numbers, too, several thousand. So that would be completely out of left field. Looking at our objectives, there's a lot of overlap. - It's classical left-wing social policy. - Thank you. We'll come up for the photos, but that's us for now. Thank you. Sahra, I sent you the Crocoll quotes at 11:30 last night. I didn't look at any quotes at 11:30. - Okay. - I haven't today. I had endless emails. - There are only two. - Okay. It's fine. You can release them. - Right, we must go back up. - How long do we have for the interview? It's at 3:30. - 3:30, fine. - Can we make it any quicker? - I have another appointment. - That's up to you. Right, then let's start. The leaders of the Greens and the SPD have distanced themselves from the movement. By all accounts there's been a ruckus in your parliamentary group. - Is this a unsuccessful takeoff? - Not at all. I don't know where you got the information that there was a ruckus. There was no ruckus. We're very glad that so many people want to join us. It exceeds my expectations by far. We currently have over 140,000 registrations. I think it's fantastic. In such a short time. And these are people who want to get started. Why aren't the media reports good? Negative things have often been written. Oh, there are fair articles. I must say, I even read one or two in "Cicero". Even in "Cicero"? Where I felt I was getting fair treatment. The executive said it hadn't been balloted and they didn't feel included. Well, you can hardly ballot a cross-party project in the Left Party Executive. I think, had it come to that, our friends from the SPD and the Greens who are involved would have said, "You can't do it like that." So I think that accusation is a bit out of place. We're in your parliamentary group office. How long do you think your double life as chair of the Left Parliamentary Group and initiator of this movement can last? How long can you stick it out? I don't see it as a double life, as I'm pursuing similar goals in both functions. I'd like a more social country. I'd like more social cohesion. And I'd like people to be able to identify with the politics in Germany, and not to feel excluded. That's my aim in both functions. Do enough of the parliamentary group take the same view, such that you'll be democratically voted back in? Well, at least no one has urged me to step down from m y office. We'll come back in a year and make an interim report. Thanks for the interview. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Bye. - All the best. Bye, Ms. Wagenknecht. I'll just go out for a moment and bring the next guest. Unity and justice and freedom For the German fatherland Towards these let us all strive Brotherly with heart and hand Unity and justice and freedom - It is really cold! - Yes, it's getting that way. Today in the Bundestag, at the end of the ceremony, and the end of the remembrance, we all sang, "Unity and justice and freedom." Unity! Those who want a land of unity have to overcome social division. Those who don't want the right-wing rabble-rousers to grow stronger have to do all they can for people to feel represented by politics, by government policies in this country. That is the crux of it. We need a movement, for a new social democracy. That's what this is about. And that's what "Aufstehen" is about. We need a 'AUFSTEHEN' Party! I'd like to tell you something. Max Schumacher is here. He has actually brought stollen and mulled wine for everybody. And he has roses for the courageous women of "Aufstehen". - You brought stollen. - Yes, of course! Very kind. I just wanted to say thank you. - Sure. We did it specially for you. - Thank you. Please, look after yourself. - I'll try! - Please look after yourself. I never imagined we'd gain 165,000 fellow campaigners in two months. And if a movement like this arises and becomes big, if it reaches milieus that the Left can't get to, which is the case, then that's a help for us. Ms. Wagenknecht, many thanks. Sahra, for the most courageous woman in "Aufstehen". Thank you. Bravo! I have one more question! The party-internal issues, are they over now? I don't know. I can't judge that. I mean there are wild rumors at both extremes. Some say there will be a great capitulation and we'll carry on as usual, which wouldn't be bad. But the others say people want to really raise the issue again in January. I can't judge. It's been like this the whole time. There have always been rumors of a motion, a deselection motion, or whatever. There hasn't been one yet. So I've stopped paying much attention to what's being bandied around. My wish is that they put an end to it, and that we can start afresh next year doing normal politics. Because we can see that the Left hasn't benefited from this. Several polls put us at 8%, which, in view of the SPD's disastrous collapse, is embarrassing. But... - Yes? - What time is it? The boss left ages ago. - Really? - She's not here. She's not there? Where is she then? No. Maybe she's just around the corner. Ah, here's Sahra now. Have a nice weekend. No, we'll be seeing each other again. If I call you, will you come down? - Great. - No, no. Drop the boss off here again. I see! I am dropping her off again. - Sahra, let's go... - We're not going home. I've got a cold. - I'm going to stay here. - Okay, fine, then... - This thing here? - Nice weekend indeed! Right, then I don't need to come in between. So be sure to skip all the spite and bullying, okay? Okay. - Take care. Bye. - Bye. I love you. Good. Unbelievable. On the subject of "Aufstehen", Sahra Wagenknecht just told me that it's important and that the Left needs this non-parliamentary opposition. What do you say to that? I'm not a fan of "Aufstehen". I think it's not a useful political initiative. We have clearly stated what we expect of our comrades who have joined "Aufstehen" and we'll see if they abide by what is expected. Thank you. There's an argument that Ms. Wagenknecht is the most popular politician in the East and she's only being retained as chair of the parliamentary group because the three most important elections are in Eastern Germany. Will Ms. Wagenknecht only remain chair of the parliamentary group for the next ten months so that you win your election? I'm the prime minister of the Free State of Thuringia and I head up a cabinet. I'm not a member of the parliamentary group, nor one of the augurs from whom you seemingly have this information. So I don't engage in speculation. I'd be glad if Ms. Wagenknecht supports m y party in the election campaign and personally I'd be glad if Ms. Wagenknecht were to appear with me in the election campaign. And as for the "Aufstehen" organization, I can't make any statements, as I'm not part of the organization and have no involvement with it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, bye. Daniel Pontzen, ZDF. Could I just ask you a few questions? - Where is your bag? - It should be in the car. Yes. You're right. There are several members of parliament who I visited in their electoral wards, and I supported them. And some of them signed a letter a year later demanding my resignation. And they were so glad to have had a big rally with me. Sure, otherwise people wouldn't have come. I mean, I couldn't do that. I don't know, I'd feel... self-conscious or... It would be fatal for me, if I expressly asked someone for help in an election campaign, who then comes specially and campaigns for the candidate. No one had a direct mandate where I was, which was mostly in the West. There were no direct mandates, but nevertheless, it's personal support. You can go to that electoral ward or to another. And then you just get... slapped in the face. You're too honest for politics. And the reactions to "Aufstehen" were a bit symptomatic of that. I mean, if a movement like that arises with that much resonance, and the party that could have benefited from it the most is the Left. If their leading representatives have only been waiting from day one for the baby to be killed off, I mean, it's so sobering. What really makes me sad about this is that "Aufstehen" hasn't yet... gotten onto its feet. - That's why you can all... - When does it become perceptible? It would become perceptible if it stood for election. Then we'd have been doing opinion polls for six months. And it would be talked about all the time. But it was a conscious decision that we didn't want to found a new party. - Bye. - Bye. Yeah, I don't know what that... I don't think it'll get any easier. But there is the danger, of course, that if it gets no easier, and the conflicts really continue, which I think will happen, unless she doesn't speak out, which would make it different, then she'll say, "Kiss my butt, do your stuff on your own." That's the danger with this. As you are aware, I have decided not to stand in the re-election of the parliamentary group leadership. The reasons for this are quite simply that my health has imposed limits for me and that I'm not willing to continue above a certain level of permanent stress. I look back fondly to the time when we led the parliamentary group together. I very much enjoyed doing that with Dietmar Bartsch and so, it was a time that I really feel was an enrichment of m y life. And now a new chapter is beginning for me. I'm also glad I'll be with the parliamentary group later, with some very interesting guests. I'd be interested to know if in the last few months you've felt bullied by friends in the party. You know, each of you can judge that. The things that took place were all public. The terms one uses to describe that, everyone can decide that for themselves. - Was that okay? - Yes. Then we have... Oh, yes. That's wonderful. Hello. So now I can give you a direct welcome. We are very glad you're here with us. Our guests, who have come straight here from the Federal Press Conference, from FridaysForFuture, please welcome... your man. I'm Luisa. I was also at the climate summit in Katowice, when the federal government decided it would miss its 2020 emissions targets, not because it's technically unfeasible, but due to a lack of political will. For me, at 22, and for our generation, that's extremely scary, because when we're there on Fridays with those young people, and there are some from first grade, it's clear that some of them won't grow live to old, because of the climate crisis. And that means that in the last few years we, or I have basically been deceived. And knowing there are people who, out of a sense of responsibility, in the positions that they're in, are simply acting... That is scary, especially when you think it through. What does that do to democracy, when there is no reason to trust that promises which have been made will be kept? Every time that clouds blow by I think of going along with them And never turning back again Until I have arrived
