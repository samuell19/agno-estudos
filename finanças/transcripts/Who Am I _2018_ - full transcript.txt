- Beautiful Texas, the Lone Star State. San Antonio's just like any other city. It's filled with people trying to live, love, and survive. But there's good and evil in this world, and they're fighting right now. I just pray that people open their eyes and they see the truth in Christ. And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said to him, receive your sight. Your faith has made you well. And immediately he received his sight and followed in glorifying God. And all the people when they saw it gave praise to God. Each and every one of us, we have to go out and ask God what we want. He will do it, but it takes faith. It takes faith to bring change. Jesus says in Matthew 17:20 that our faith can move mountains. It can even move our past. When we have faith, nothing can stop us from moving forward. Faith in the Lord gives us strength, hope, and courage. It brings great change. Hopelessness to hope. And it changes darkness to light. - Hold on. Hey, Tasha. You got out? - Yeah. Free. - All right. Try this. - Actually, I'm clean now. - What, did you get Jailhouse Jesus? - No, not Jailhouse Jesus.

Well, good work, gang. We saved two lives today. - Can't believe she's pregnant. - Yeah, I'm happy the baby also survived. - She's been through a lot of abuse. Let's make sure she's taken care of, okay? Before I head out, let's go ahead and bow our heads for prayer. Lord, I thank you for the success of this operation and I ask that you send your blessings to Linda here and the little blessing inside of her. - Good. You're doing a good job. - I'm never gonna be able to play piano like you. - Says who? I think you'll be able to play better than me. - I don't think so. - I know so. Why don't you try again? - Okay. - What, no, keep going. It sounds good. - No, I'm done. - Hey, don't. Don't let your dreams be dreams. - Man, you're late for dinner. - Yeah. She okay? - Yeah, she'll be fine. She's just having a hard time with one of her songs, but she'll learn it. - Yeah, she will. - Yeah. You gonna play me something? - I was just about to ask you that. - You had me thinking just 'cause I was black, I couldn't be successful. - Yeah, yeah, that's true. - No, it's not true, Marcus. It's an excuse, a bad excuse. It don't matter what color you are. - Look, I don't know who you been talking to, but they got your head all messed up. - No, no, Marcus, nobody has been messing with my head. I know the truth. In fact, the truth set me free. - That don't sound like no kinda truth to me. But when you need this, you let me know. Hey, Tasha. Hey, Pastor. How are you? - I'm good. Didn't mean to interrupt. - No, you're fine, just finishing up. - Listen, I was hoping that you could come to our jail ministry with the Kendall County Police. I think it'd be really good if you came and shared your testimony. - That sounds really great. But. I don't think that they would allow it. I. It's my background. I have a record. I've been in jail. - Listen, Tasha, I promise you, the inmates will connect more with you, and they'll see what Christ has done in you and you'll lift them up. I think there's a calling in your life for that. - When? - Wednesday. Unless you have work. - I'm a hairdresser down the street, but I think I can get off. - I think you'll be really good. - Thank you, Pastor. - No, thank you, Tasha. If you'll excuse me. - You're awake. - Why didn't you let me die? - Everything's gonna be okay. - You don't know that. - Just relax. Just relax, okay? - I can't. Oh, oh, oh. My baby. - Your baby's also good. He's okay, all right? He's alive, too. Just relax, just relax. Just relax. Take a deep breath. There you go, take a deep breath, relax. There you go, there you go. Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Kravitz, a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Flores, dial 118, please. Dr. Flores, please dial 118. - Hey, Joe. That was quick. - What was the emergency? - Well, there's a girl here and she's asking for a pastor. - Okay. What's her name? - Linda. She tried to kill herself and she's four months pregnant. - So, that was your emergency last week, okay. - Body's in bad shape but I believe you can help her. - Yeah. Can I see her? - Absolutely. She's in Grace House Recovery Center right now. Let's go ahead and get you scheduled for an appointment. - Yeah, I'd like that. Just trust me. Her testimony will cause the inmates to change. It'll encourage them, I know it. - You do realize what a huge risk I'm taking by doing this for you. I mean, the FBI is gonna run a background check eventually. All right. I do have to let my captain know about this though. - I know. - Okay. See ya then. I'm gonna lose my job. - You seem happy. - I am very happy, girl. - About what? - Jesus makes me happy. - Amen. - Hallelujah. Hallelujah. - Hey, I have an appointment with Linda Tortellini? - She's in the back room to the right. If you could sign in for me? - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Sweet baby. Nobody's gonna hurt you. You're mine. - No one's gonna hurt your baby. - You must be the pastor. - Yeah, I'm Pastor Joe. - I know I asked for a pastor, but I just don't think I'm really ready to talk to one yet. I think I made a mistake, I'm sorry. - Are you sure? I mean. I'm a good listener. - I'm just not ready. - Well, if you change your mind, all right? I'll be praying for you. - Listen, Joe, these things take time. Just give her a little bit. She'll come around, I promise. And when she does, I'll let you know. Okay. We'll talk soon. Bye. Hey, Pastor. - How ya doing? - Pastor, why do you do this? - It's because Jesus loves us. - That's what people say. - It's true. He came here and died for us so that we could live. - So, he's dead then? - No, he. He resurrected. - Okay, you're lying. - I know it's confusing. You know, you should come to our Bible study and can help you understand. - Maybe. - You'd like it. - Okay. Just. If he died. And then he came back, how do you know that? - Well, it's in the Bible, you know? Jesus is the only one who died, and he came back. And that's the difference between our religion and every other religion, you know? Our God came back to life. For us. I know it's hard to understand. - Okay. - Have some water. - Thank you. Thank you, Pastor. I appreciate that. - See ya, Mary. - If my parents knew I was talking to a pastor they'd kill me. - Well, we'll make sure this is confidential. - I'm 19 years old and three months pregnant. I don't know what to do. - Jesus will help you. - Jesus? My family is Muslim. - Do they know? - No. A friend of mine told me that. That you could help me. - Yeah, that's what we do. We definitely can help you. - I'm scared. I wanna have an abortion. - May I read you a scripture? Psalms 139. Verse 13 says for you have formed my inward parts. You have covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise you for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are your works, and that my soul knows very well. My frame was not hidden from you. When I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, your eyes saw my substance being yet unformed, and yet, in your book, they were all written, the days fashioned for me when as yet, there were none of 'em. - I don't know what to do. - I know it's a hard choice, and the choice is yours to make. Let your child live. Give him a chance. He's wonderfully formed. He's a miracle. God always provides a way, even when it looks so bleak, I promise. We'll be here for you, for whatever you need. The church will be there. We'll be there. Tasha? Tasha. - Mama. Okay. - Now, what exactly was I holding for? - Nothing, I was just getting ready for bed. My hair just, ugh. I got something for you. - What is it? - Gobble gobble, baby. - Mama, it's whiskey in here. - Mm-hmm. - I'll drink it later, Mama. - You didn't like it? - No, I'll drink it later. I'm not really thirsty right now. Thank you. I'd like to start by letting you all know that Jesus has changed me. I'm Tasha. I know a lot of y'all probably know me. I've been in jail far too many times. I was a madam. I danced in clubs. I sold drugs. Did drugs. I hurt people. I spent 20 years doing the Devil's work. I thought I was gonna die in here. I thought I was gonna die in this jail. But one day, I accepted Jesus. He came to me and I accepted him. And now, my life is abundant with love. And that's what I want. I want that for all of you because I'm so satisfied now in Him. God has more in store for all of you, and I want you to see that like I saw it. - Hi, are you new? I'm London. What's your name? - Did you study for the math test? No, I didn't. - Guys. - What? We're gonna be late for the math test. - Look at the way she dresses. It's disgusting. - Just ignore them. - I'm Tammy. - I'm really hungry. Do you want half of my lunch? What type of food do you like? - I like hotdogs. - We're gonna be good friends. - Hello? Hey, Michelle, how ya doing? - I can't talk right now. Well, I just wanted to let you know that we've been praying for you. - I don't need your prayers. Well, listen, God has an answer. Have you ever considered adoption? - Listen, I'll think about it. I gotta go. - So, how was your day? - It was good. There's a new girl. - She from out of town? - Kind of. She's different. - What do you mean? - Well, I don't wanna gossip, but her clothes are dirty and she smells. She's just different. - You know, when there's people like that, you gotta be nice to them, you know? You should hang out with them, invite 'em to youth group. That's what Jesus would do. - I don't think it's gonna work out like that. But you know what my favorite thing is? - Ice cream? - No, hanging out with you. - I love hanging out with you too, daughter. Want some? - But now that you mention it, ice cream would be good. - All right, slow down, slow down. There's no race. - It's delicious. - See, I knew you loved ice cream more than me. It's all over your face. - The ice cream's your competition? - I guess. - I mean, you are second. - What do you mean? - Jesus is first. - I guess I can't be mad at that. That's a good girl. I raised a good daughter. - Mom's still better than you though. - If Jesus is number one and I'm number two-- - Mom's up there with Jesus. - You can't do that, that's sacrilegious. - It's my rules. - I gotta teach you about Jesus a little bit. - Mercy upon me, oh God, according to your loving kindness for my sin. I acknowledge my transgressions. - Tasha, honey. Hey, Mama. - Got you a drink. Thank you, Mama. You're welcome. What is it? - It's your favorite drink. Drink up. - It's good. Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, take another sip, baby. Let me have it. - Watch me verily. My son. No weapon shall be formed against you. Are you disappointed? - Disappointed by what? - I thought by now I'd have some news for you. - What kinda news? - A baby. - Don't worry about that. When we're ready, God will provide. And besides, we're already blessed with adoption. - That's what I love about you. You always trust God. - I love you. - I love you more. - Tasha? Tasha, baby. - Where's my money? - What are you doing, man? Come on, just relax. I'm getting it right now. Look, here. - What's this? - That's what I owe you, man. What do you mean that's what I owe you? That's the money. - I'll be back. - Yeah, she's about three months pregnant. - That's what I thought. Well, how soon can you take care of it? - Can't do it this week. Maybe next week? - Well, the sooner, the better. - I'm gonna need more money this time. - This one's different than Linda. - Again. I need to forgive her, Jesus. You said 70 times seven, Lord. You said 70 times seven. I need to forgive my mama, Jesus. - Tasha, you awake? Did you sleep good? - Yeah, mama. I slept perfect 'cause of you. - Because of me? - Mama, you stole my money. - You accusing me? - You stole my money again, mama. Why? You know, no, no, no. I forgive you. - You forgive me? - I forgive you. I forgive you. - You forgive me for what? I came in here to wake you up. I don't need all of this. You are an ungrateful little something. - So, Tammy's pregnant. - Who's gonna take care of it this time? - Who do you think is gonna take care of it? Gino. - Can you get me more whiskey? - Really? Would you focus for a second? And also we need to go find Linda. - You told me she killed herself. - Yeah, well she's not dead and they've got her in a halfway house. Would you? Hey. Put it down for a second and listen to me. Focus. All right, she's in a halfway house. I'm not gonna be able to get you more whiskey if our money maker is in the halfway house. Would you focus right now? We need to go find Linda. - I need a drink. - Shut up. Shut your mouth and get focused right now because we're gonna lose out on it. - It helps me focus. What's wrong with you? - Hi Pastor. - Hey David. How you doing? - Doing good. - You having fun over there? - Yeah. - How's your dad? - He's doing good. He's coming to church. On Sunday? - Yes. - That's really good. I'll see you there, too, right? - Mm hm. - Bye buddy. Hey, how you doing? - Pastor, can you pray for me to have my own place? - Yeah, I'll pray. - My family is just living in so much sin. It's too much temptation. - I understand. Maybe you should bring 'em to church. - It would take a miracle. - Maybe you could pay 'em. - That might work. Y'all gonna hear me. Y'all gonna hear what I got to say. - You hear that? I don't care what none of y'all got to say. - Sounds like my brother. - She may dress like a woman but inside she's really a man and y'all gon' hear me. I ain't leaving until somebody hear what I got to say. Tasha's a man. There you go. Tasha's a man. - Marcus, why are you doing this? - What you mean why am I doing this? - You need to stop it. - I ain't stopping nothing. I'm telling them the truth. You need to know the truth. - It doesn't matter. Listen. All that matters is she has a new life in Christ. - I don't wanna hear nothing about no new life in Christ. You left me. It's supposed to be me and you. I'm your brother, remember? Don't touch me. That's a man right there. All that matters is Jesus is given her a second chance. - I don't wanna hear that. Don't give me that Jesus talk. You don't know her like I do. You don't know him like I do. Why don't you tell him? Tell him, Tasha. Oh now you ain't got nothing to say? Tell him, Tasha. - All right guys, if you did the homework, you should know this. So again, slope equals rise over run. What three values are you left with? Anybody? Guys, what's going on? Why's everybody? Tammy. Tammy. Need to speak to you after class. All right, guys. - She smells. - She needs a shower. - Guys, leave her alone. She can hear you. Y equals negative two. - Yeah. I need to talk to you immediately. - Yeah, it sounds serious. I am. I'm at the jail. - Yeah, I'll come right now. Don't worry about it. I was on my way out anyways. Please come quickly. - Okay. All right. - It's probably better we do this in here. - Is everything okay? - How well do you know Tasha? - I know she's a good person. - Really? You really think so? 'Cause look at this. She's a man. Look. She's gone by several names in her life, but her birth certificate says Howard Johnson. The last time they picked her up and arrested her, she gave them the name Tasha. - Do you trust Jesus and me? - Of course I do but I don't know what that has to do with this. - Do you believe in dreams? - I guess. Sometimes. Why? - God gave me a dream a few nights ago. It all makes sense now. He said Tasha is my precious daughter. God sees her as a woman. - Just seems so weird how you. How do you know that? - I trust in the holy spirit. I know it's difficult but. She's changed. - Pastor, she's been in jail over 45 times. 45. - And I know that through prayer she's a new woman and she's not gonna go back here. - You actually believe that? - Yes, I do. - All right if you really believe that, you better do something and you better do something quickly. - Yeah. Thank you, Dwayne. - Have a good night, man. - I'll see you in church. - What are you still doing here? - Mr. Perez wants to see me. - Principal Walker. - Hey you. What are you still doing here? It's late. - I was planning to meet a student. - Is everything okay? - I don't know. She's strange. - Are there problems at home? - I believe so. Her behavior shows that something's not right. - Well, who is she? - Tammy Cartalini. - Yeah, I remember her. She's been in and out of several schools and her dad interesting. - She left behind this drawing. A little disturbing. And she falls asleep in class. Pretty girl but very sad. - Yeah, let's keep an eye on her a little while longer. We may need to contact the authorities. - Okay, sure. Thank you. She's just been through so much, you know. - So how can we help her? - We just have to pray. God give me wisdom. Father God, we lift up Tasha. No weapon formed against her shall prosper, Lord. Give her faith. Give her strength. So you just stopped everything just like that? - Look, by his strength. - Wow. - Your pastor is calling you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - My pastor's calling me. - My pastor never calls me. - See I got a good pastor. - You do. - Hey Pastor. Yeah, okay. Sure when? All right. No, no. Okay, see you soon. - Hey T, why aren't you at work? Tasha, where you going? - What do you want, Marcus? You need some money or something? - No. Not today. - Seem like every time I see you, you're asking for something. - Look T. I see you, okay. I see everything you been doing. I just. It seems like you really changed. - I have. - Yeah. I mean that's good. Look, where you going now? - On my way to meet with the pastor and then probably Bible study after that. - Bible study, huh? - Yeah. - Can I go with you? I had a dream about you last night in it. It was unusual. - Well tell me about your dream, Pastor. - You were sitting and ministering to these women and I heard God's voice tell me, Tasha is my precious daughter. And you know, it's been ministering to me all day, but God put an emphasis on daughter and I'm not sure why. - Pastor. Your dream is the answer to my prayers. - What do you mean? - I was born with an hermaphroditic condition. I have both male and female parts. I was born October 14, 1958. My mother was only 15 years old. She was a prostitute. And my dad was a pimp. When they first saw me, it scared them. When I was 14 months and my dad took me to my grandmother's. He just left me there in the living room and from that day forward she cared for me. She fed me. She changed my diapers. She took me to church every Sunday. ♪ This is the day ♪ ♪ If you believe it ♪ ♪ This is the day ♪ ♪ That the Lord has made ♪ ♪ We say this is the day ♪ - There is no black or white or yellow or brown skin in the eyes of God. - When I was 13, my body started changing. All I knew was my male parts and then my female parts started growing. And then as I got older, I just hated going to school. Oh I hated it. - Freak. - Let's go out and fight. - Guys, leave him alone. Come on. Sissy. - Everybody knew me as a boy. I dressed like a boy. I tried to hide. But my body just started to look different. They would tease me. Going to school was a nightmare and the only people that accepted me was the homosexuals. My breast continued to grow and I tried my best to hide 'em. - You could've taken care of it when she was an infant. Now, it's going to be a long process. It's very costly. - And then after all the doctors, we went to see the pastor. The pastor. - He is cursed. He cannot get saved. He should've never been born. He is from the devil. - Can you imagine how I felt, Pastor? For someone to tell you that you're cursed. - Please. - No, no. - Please don't go. Please. Don't go. - And that day forward I had no more desire to be good. I started dressing like a woman because I felt like a woman. When I was 18, I started forging checks. I went to jail. I did drugs. What's wrong? - Are you being a good girl? - Yeah, I'm good. - Does the good girl want some more? - That's why I'm here. - Give me a kiss. Now go inside and I'll bring you some more. Go on, go. Sweet dreams. - I became a madam. Y'all comfortable? Get up. What's going on? What's happening? Y'all supposed to be out there working 'cause you owe me. - Okay, I just don't feel good. - I don't care how you feel. Your job is to make my money. You understand? Do you speak English? Do you understand? Hello, do you hear me talking to you? We'll fix that. Something funny? Do you think something's funny? You got places to be, ladies. Go. Let's go. Drug dealing, gangs, mafias. Get out here. Where is my money? Where is my money? Huh, think you can play me? You think you gon' play Tasha? Nobody stiffs Tasha. Nobody stiffs Tasha. Nobody. Get up. Get up. I was in all kinds of relationships. It didn't matter who it was with. Men. Women. I lived a perverted life. Thief. What are you doing? - I'm sorry, I'm just hungry. - Everyone is hungry. It's your lucky day. Get up. Get up. Come with me. Drop that. - Here you go, ladies. Can I get you all something else or is this all? All right. - You know you can chew your food, right? So what's your story? - Can you help me? I'm running from my stepdad. He sells me to men. - Eat. How old are you? - 17. - You can come work with me. - Doing what? - Just whatever I tell you. Nothing big. I'll take care of you. - Where's my money? Where's the rest? - That's all I owe you. - Where's the rest? - You gon' do something, do it. I didn't think so. That's all right. Happens more than you think. - Come on, let's go. Daddy's here. What the heck? - Hey relax, I'm her dad. Wait a minute. - He's not my dad. - She's just confused. She's got mental issues. Relax, I'm her dad. Everybody just enjoy your food. Let's go. - He's not my dad. Please no. He's not my dad. - What the heck are you looking at? Can I help you? What a day. Check. - Tasha. Tasha. - Look if you want that, I ain't got it right now. - No, no. All right. My uncle wants to buy a girl. - Really? - Yeah, really. - How 'bout that one? - That one? - She cute right? - Oh yeah. Think he'll be pretty happy with that selection. - I think so, too. 200 bucks. All right. - What do you want? - I want her. - What you wanna buy her? - You heard me. I said I want her, didn't I? - Don't think I'm ready for all that. - Well when you decide you're ready, you let me know. Last year I went to jail for stabbing my partner. It was in self defense but I was charged with 85 years. The only witness I had was my mama. She wouldn't testify. She was scared of getting caught. She didn't want to snitch. I mean I knew why. She been to jail over 100 times, but I just I felt so betrayed. I swear to God, mama, I'm a make you pay for this. I was in solitary confinement. I was just screaming, screaming at God. Why am I here? Don't you know who I am? I am Tasha. I am a good person. When I got it, I help people. I take care of my people. Ah, ah. And God, he came to me. He told me I was on my way to hell. Help. Help. - I think something's wrong with her. - Yeah. - That's not me. That's not me. That's not me. That's not me. Cannot get saved. Cannot get saved. He's from the devil. - You playing with me? Thief. I'm sorry. You playing with me? Thief. Get up. You know what I'm saying? Let's go. - Listen. - Cannot get saved. He's from the devil. - I was so scared and I knelt down on the floor and I just started praying. I prayed to God with every fiber of my being. I prayed to him. I repented all of my sins. Every last one of 'em and he saved me. And then God spoke. He spoke to me. And he told me that my body. My body would be healed. - My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles. God chose Jesus. The Bible says that he was the stone that the builders rejected. He became the chief cornerstone. Isn't that amazing how sometimes we can reject something that God will accept and say it's perfect and it's beautiful and here's the crazy thing. Think about it this way. Have you ever received a gift that you didn't like? - Hey yes, my sister. She needs surgery. So there's nothing? Hey Pastor, I'm glad you answered. I have a friend who needs surgery and I remember you said that you had a friend in Mexico who's a doctor. Do you have his number? Hey. - Hey mama. You're late. - It's good to see you, too. Daddy. - What were you doing out there? Making money. - Now mama, you know everything ain't about money. - Oh it is always about money. That's such a sad story. - Tasha's an overcomer. Revelations 3:12 says that heaven is for the overcomers. - Hey Pastor. Hey Tasha. Sister Rose, she's gonna go with you in Mexico. - Thank you, Pastor. Don't worry about anything, okay. - I know it's very expensive. Don't worry about it. God is good. He needs you to be free, okay. - Okay. Just pack up and have a good morning, okay. - Okay. God bless. - Thank you, Pastor. - Where you going? - I'm going to Mexico, mama. - What you gonna do that for? You gonna meet up with the Mexican mafia or something? - No, you know that's my past, mama. I feel free. I feel so happy. - I bet you do. - Look, if you came to Jesus, you could feel free. - Oh no, I'm good. - Jesus will make you happy, mama. - Is she trying to convert you? - And what's wrong if I am? - Keep that to yourself, girl. - But I love you both. It's the only reason why. - When are you gonna be back? - I don't know, mama. - Do you think you have some money that you can give us before you go? - Why? So you can buy drugs with it? - Oh no. It's nothing like that. I just need a little bit of money to take care of some things. That's all. - Okay, you go to church on Sunday, I'll give you the money. Both of y'all. - All right, we'll be at church. - There's my ride. - You going to Mexico with a white girl? - Yes, mama. It's my friend. - She looks like a good woman. - Hey now, watch it. You know you can't trust those white folks. - People are people. - Bye daddy. Sunday. Don't be late. Are you nervous? - Yeah exactly. But I think my parents are more nervous than I am. - I'm sure they are. - Well not really 'cause of the surgery 'cause I didn't really tell them about it. They're more nervous I got in a van with a white woman. - They're nervous about me? - Yeah, don't take it personal though. We're kind of raised to not trust white people. That's too bad, you know. - There's no right way to say that. I'm sorry. - It's okay but in God's eyes we're all the same color so. What do you think about Jesus? - What do you wanna know about that for? - Look, if there is no God, there is no way Tasha could've changed like that. - All I know is I need more stuff. - I have done everything to support your habit. I've lied to the cops. I've stole, rob banks. Hid dead bodies in the tub. Sold drugs. - We got caught so many times, didn't we? - We need to give all this up. Let's just let all this poison go. Look, I always feel tormented. Nothing makes me happy. I'm miserable. - Marcus, that's just 'cause you need more drink and more of that good stuff. - No. No ma, I don't need that. I need what Tasha has. - What does she have? - Jesus. - Father God, we lift up Tasha. No weapon formed against her shall prosper, Lord. Give her faith. Give her strength. Give her strength in this time of need, Lord God. We don't know everything going on, Lord God, but you're liable to deal and heal. - What are you doing here? - Can we talk? - Why do you care? - It's what Jesus would do. - Jesus. - I just wanna help. - Do you think that Jesus could help my sister? - Where is she? - She's with my mom. - Well if she's with your mom, I'm sure she's fine. - My mom is an alcoholic. - Look, I don't wanna hear anything that you have to say. Look, I know you wanna keep this baby, but that just ain't gonna happen. - Hi, this is Principal Walker. May I please speak with Andrew Hernandez? Yeah, I'm calling to report a possible child neglect situation. Yes, I'll hold. - When I was 14, my dad died. My mom brought home this man. She started drinking with him all the time. After that, while she would be at work, he would bring awful men into our home. - Man, you need to pay me some more money. She's been in there a long time. - This enough for you? - It's just business. - Same time tomorrow. Don't be late. - And he said I could never tell anyone because he would kill me and my sister and my mom. I don't wanna go with him. - You just need to listen. Otherwise. - Please don't hurt my sister. - Then do what you're told. You understand? - Yes. No, no. I've escaped so many times. - I told you to never do this again. You're mine, you hear me? - Ah. Let me go. Let go. Let go. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. - But all that is over now. You're safe. - What about my sister? Do you think they could find her? Help her? - Do you know anything that could help lead us there? Which road it's on? Which part of town it's in? - I know it's on the north side of town. - What kind of house it is? - It's a rock house. It's tan rock. It's big house, beautiful. Has a big front yard. Has a flag, an American flag. It's hidden by trees so you can't see it from the roads. Behind the house is a shed near the barn and that's where they take all the little kids. Har, har, har har, har. Shimmy me timbers. - Father God we ask that your will be done in their life. Lord God please save all these children in this house. There's so much going on here, Lord God we know, but your will we can find them. Jesus I ask that you help Linda here and open her mind. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You ever read the Bible? - I've been thinking about it. - Psalms is my favorite. This is Psalms 23. It says the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lay down in green pasture and he restores my soul. - Wait. Shepherd's Way. That's what it is. I remember seeing the sign. - On the north side. - On the north side. - There's not many houses there. - No. I think we could really find it if we could just go to that highway. - Some members of my church are on the force, okay. I'm gonna call them right now, okay. If you'd like to come with me, I could talk to the staff here and see if we can set something up, okay. - Yes, yes I'd like to come with you. - All right, you wait right here. I'll be right back, okay. - I'm scared. - It's gonna be all right, I promise. - Maybe we shouldn't have called the police. - You just have to trust God, all right. - There's just a lot of kids there. I'm just kind of worried that. I just don't want anyone to get hurt. No. They're gonna handle it, I promise. - I'm scared. I wanna go home. - It'll be okay. - It's okay, Lois. It's all right. - Shut up. - No. - Put your hands up. Sit down. - Put your hands behind your back right now. Whatever you wanna do. - Pam, shut up. Pam, shut your mouth. - We're from the Sheriff's office. We're here to help you, okay. - We got about 12 kids. We're gonna have y'all stand up here in a second. We're gonna get out the room, okay. - Everybody okay? Your friends okay? Okay, we're gonna do tag, okay. To dispatch. We're gonna need meds. We have a bunch of little kids. - Ambo standby. We're gonna get them out of here. All right guys, follow us. - Clear. - Untie your other hand. All right, come with me. You need me. Don't forget it. You need me. Look at the wall. Don't you forget it, Tam. Keep your hands up, ma'am. Steady against the wall. Stay there. Keep your hands up where I can see them. All clear. Stop right there. Stop right there. - That's my sister. - All right, go 'head. - Tammy. Oh. Nobody's gonna hurt us anymore, okay. I swear. I knew you'd come back. - I just couldn't do it. The words you read resonated in my ears. I couldn't get 'em out of my head. - You made the right choice. I'm so happy for you. - Would you two take care of my son? - Yes. Yes. - I just know you guys would make great parents for him. - Thank you. - I do have one request. I'd like to give him his name. Would you name him Andrew? - That's a wonderful name. - Of course. - What are your plans afterwards? - I just got accepted to NYU. - That's incredible. Like I said, God, he makes a way for everything. And God knows we want a bigger family. So, this is the answer to everyone's prayers. We'll take good care of your son. - Thank you. - Hey, are you sure they have been all handled in there? - Yeah. Yeah definitely. - You guys need anymore, just let me know. - I'll make sure the inmates get 'em. - Here's the donations for the inmates. If there's anything else I can do, just let me know. - Thanks. Hey, I gotta tell you. I've seen some real change in the inmates and I can't think of any other reason than the gospel. - Praise the Lord. Listen, I'm always looking to help. If there's anything else that opens up, you let me know okay. - As soon as there's an opening, you will be the first to know. - Okay. - Hey. I meant to ask you. How's Tasha? - She's actually in Mexico right now. You said be quick right. - I did. All right, Dwayne. - So I hear Linda and Tammy are enjoying the visits you and Violet are making to Grace House. - They're really great girls. You probably already know this, but we're going to adopt them. - Yes, I figured you folks would be heading in that direction. Are we gonna have to start calling you George Mueller? - I pray so. Woo. Wow what a shot. What a shot. Your turn. - Got the ball maybe. All right. Human trafficking needs to stop. It's happening here in our backyard. 70,000 are human trafficked every year in Texas. 300,000 in America. If we all open our bibles together. Proverbs chapter 24 verse 11 through 12. Deliver those who are drawn toward death and hold back those stumbling to the slaughter. If you say surely we do not know this, does not he who weighs the heart consider it? He who keeps your soul, does he not know it? And will he not render to each man according to his deeds? During the time of Abraham Lincoln, he gathered all the passages together to fight slavery and he put an end to it. He gathered all the churches and with God's power, he ended slavery. Martin Luther King, he himself a pastor, got all the Christians and the churches together and he fought for civil rights and he won his battle. Human trafficking is nothing different than modern day slavery and something has to be done. If the churches can come together, we can fight this and we can win. With the help of the leadership of this country and with prayer we can win. Our brothers and sisters live in bondage. And if we ourselves live in bondage, we need to be set free. If there's anyone here today who wants to give their life to the Lord, I ask you please come forward. Please. Amen, hallelujah. - Amen, amen. It's good to have you guys come up here. You guys would all like to stretch out your hands and repeat after me. Say Jesus. Jesus. - Forgive me. Forgive me. - For all of my sins. For all of my sins. - Wash me with your blood. Wash me with your blood. - I open my heart. I open my heart. - And I let you into my heart. And I let you into my heart. - Forgive me. Forgive me. - For everything. For everything. - I accept you. I accept you. - As my Lord and savior. As my Lord and savior. - In Jesus name we pray. In Jesus name we pray. - Amen. Amen. - Tasha? Hey. Welcome. Come here. - My body's healed. - Look, look, your family. They're here. - Amen. - Please forgive me. Please forgive me. - 70 times seven, I forgive you. I forgive you. - Would you mind sharing what's been going on with everything in your life? This woman's been through a lot. She's found her way through Christ. - Yeah. First, I'd like to thank God. I wanna thank him for saving me. Somebody like me can be saved. I have done so much in my life. So much wrong. I hurt so many people. Drugs. Crime. Trafficking. You don't know how bad I was. Pastor. I wanna pray. I wanna pray for all the people that I hurt. - Tasha. - All my victims. Just please I gotta pray. All the people that I trafficked. All the people that I hurt. I just need to pray for them, Pastor. Please, I need forgiveness. - Father, we ask that you find the lost and brokenhearted. You lift up all the people in Tasha's life she's hurt, Lord God. We ask that you save them. We ask that you find them. You deliver them, Lord God. Your will be done in their life. Protect them. Guide them home. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. - I don't know if you remember me. - I am so sorry for trying to traffic you. Please forgive me. - Of course. Of course I forgive you. - Thank you. - A lot going on here but I promise you, if you ask, God will hear you, and he will forgive you. Amen. ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ - You've just watched a very powerful film that touches on one of the most sensitive issues in America. The issue of abortion. My name is Alan Parker. I'm the president of the Justice Foundation. I've represented over 3000 women at the United States Supreme Court in front of the court briefs telling the court that abortion hurts women. The most common kind of abortion is adult parents or guardians forcing a minor teenager to have an abortion against her will. That's illegal in every state. The second most common is an adult man forcing another woman or his woman to abort his baby because maybe he doesn't wanna pay child support or he doesn't want another child. That's illegal in every state. And the third is human trafficking or pimping. And the trafficker or the pimp is forcing her to have an abortion so she stays in the business. It's a dirty business. The Justice Foundation is willing to help you if you or someone you know is being forced or coerced or just unduly pressured to have an abortion against the woman's will, contact the Justice Foundation. We can provide you legal tools where you can stop an abortion or we can help the people directly or get them local resources and lawyers to help them. Stop forced abortion in your area. Contact the Justice Foundation at 1-866-40UTCRY. And if you are considering an abortion and you need help. You wanna know what the real consequences of abortion are. You wanna know your alternatives to abortion, then contact the National or the International Helpline at 866-482-LIFE. And let me tell you one other alternative. Every state in this country has what's called a safe haven law. And under that law, you don't have to kill a baby to be free from the burden of child care. Why do women get abortions? Usually it's for one of only two kinds of reasons. Many of them feel I can't take care of this baby at this time in my life. Others simply say I don't wanna take care of a baby at this time, but for whatever reason, if a woman thinks she can't take care of that baby, she can transfer responsibility of the child to her state within a set period of time under state law. It's justice for the baby. Let the child live. It's mercy for the woman. If you can't take care of the baby, someone else will. Let's move forward to a new day where we give life to the children, we help the women, and prevent them from being injured by abortion and we help the million people who are waiting to adopt healthy children. That's the loving solution to the whole problem of abortion. Thank you. - Well hello. My name is Charles Flowers. I'm the Senior Pastor of Faith Outreach Center International here in the city of San Antonio and I also lead an organization called San Antonio in Black, White, and Brown. It is the number one space in San Antonio where influencers from every race, position, and perspective come together with other influencers to do two things. One is to build trusting relationships. And secondly it is collaborate on both the value and the implementation of principals. It's principals around which we agree and principals are colorblind. And so many of the divisions are crossed when we stick with principal as in this movie. The principal of truth. The principal of love. The principal of walking by faith. And the principal of kindness transcends all of those other things that we seek to divide and cancel us out. It is certainly worthy of your viewing and it's worthy of you telling somebody else that there is a film that actually resonates with what is in your heart. Thank you.
