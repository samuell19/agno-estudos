It shall not be And if that's so I'd better go I'll go, I'll go Adonis, keeper of my heart Now fare thee well for we must part Farewell, we'll meet again Farewell We two will meet anew A fowler gay in me you see There are not many more like me I am a well-known person here belov'd wherever I appear I play my pipe and at the sound all kinds of birds do flock around By catching birds I earned my fame and Papageno is my name Of course I'm happy in my trade but I get Ionesome for a maid Alone I wander all day long and only birds a can hear my song No girls come flocking around my feet although my melody is sweet I want a maiden of my own to have and keep for me alone Now you frightened him. I catch birds for the queen of the night So this is her territory? Have you ever seen her? You must be mad. She wouldn't show herself to just anybody - What are you staring at? - Of course. You saved me from the dragon. Dragon, indeed. Well, the main thing is someone killed it. - But how? You're unarmed. - I've got a strong fist. Papageno! No wine today. Only water... And no cake. But you may have a stone. No sweet figs either. But pray accept this padlock for your lips. Prince Tamino, be still. Our Queen sends you this locket with her daughter's picture. If you are not indifferent to her features... then bliss, honor, and fame await you. The beauty of this wondrous face divine in all its tender grace a feeling is aroused in me A hope of bliss and ecstasy I can't comprahend this wistful yearning But my be wildered heart is burning Can it be love, this mystery? It is I know that it must be I know it, I know it What else but love could it be? Where does she dwell, my heart's desire? How might I best her love inspire? If only now my dream came true What is my dream? That she were here so I could face her And with a lover's gentle arms embrace her Then she would be forever mine then she would be forever mine - The path fortune lies open. - Our Queen has heard every word. She has read your heart At last, she feels certain her daughter can be rescued. Pamina was abducted by a mighty sorcerer. She lay asleep under the cypresses one day... when Sarastro crept up to her. Yes, he is a devillishly cunning man... with many defferent guises... and he kured Pamina away. I shall rescue her, I swear by my love. Listen, Tamino. Do you hear a distant thunder? - Night falls over the mountain. - Our Queens is coming. No need to fear, my dearest friend Your heart is gentle daring pure And you alone have the strength and power to aid a mother un her darkest hour Life holds for me but grief and sorrow since my dear child was lured away Now gray and cloudy dawns each morrow A wanton deed destroyed my peace of yesterday The memory still daunts me Forever it haunts me Her vain protestation her sad lamentation I heard her crying in the distance Oh, help! In vain she had to plead I could not come to her assistance I failed her in her hour of need My power failed me in her hour of need You must go through hell and through high water Perilous land you must explore Yes, perilous land you must explore But if you bring me back my daughter then she is yours forever more Then she is yours... forever more Do I sleep or do I wake? Is this a dream or reality? Your punishment was prompt indeed but I think they were too hard on you It's hardly pity that you need but alas, there's nothing I can do Our Queen, so merciful and wise now pardons you for tellings lies - Hey listen... Papageno's talking. - Now do beware of tellings lies. - I'll never tell another lie. - The padlock is your reason why. The padlock is my reason why. Oh that the lips of every liar could thus be sealed and locked for good Instead of malice, hate, and ire We would have love and brotherhood My prince, accept this gift from me, a present from Her Majesty A magic flute she now has sent you for your protection on this venture just play, and you may take for granted your listeners wil be enchanted The sad will feel the joy of life The bachelor will seek a wife Such a magic flute is a treasure of tremendous worth For by its sound man is inspired to love in peace with all on earth It is time for me to go now - Ladies.

That's not really in my line To Sarastro... Thank you, no. If our venture should miscarry he would have me plucked and roasted and then feed me to the crow Why feel alarm? The Prince will keep you safe from harm Oh that the Prince would go to blazes. My life is clear to me I do not trust their pretty phrases. They are no guarantee - A small advance is only fair - Well, well, what is in there? These little bells that sweetly tingle And could I also make them jingle? But of course, yes, certainly! Flute of magic, bells of vision keep us safe upon our missien Now good luck, you fearless men Now farewell, we'll meet again But we don't know the way. Pray tell where does this vile Sarastro dwell? We are three spirits to attend you Our help and counsel we will lend you Just keep in mind that you'd be wise always to do as we advise They are three spirits to attend us Their help and counsel they will lend us Just keep in mind that you'd be wise always to do as we advise It's time that we went on our way Farewell, we'll meet another day We'll meet again We'll meet again - Now, Pamina. Caught at last - Oh, my heart, don't beat so fast - Don't think you'll ever leave - It's not for myself I grieve But my poor mother'll die, I fear from losing one she held so dear Pamina, you will be locked in so that you can't escape us I'd rather have you like me Barbarian! Now strike me down Away, away! Now let us be alone This puzzles me... whose house is this? But look... there is Pamina. This is too good to miss Good evening my dear girl Say, what is going on here? This surely is the fiend himself Yes, this must be the fiend himself - Have mercy! - Me? Mercy? - Please spare me now! - I? Spare you now? Go - Who are you? - The Queen of the Night sent me. - My mother... What's your name? - Papageno. But let me check first. "Beautiful eyes"...yes Though a little red. "Fair hair"...it is fair. "Red lips"...your lips are red. Everything's right Except the feet. According to this picture, you don't have feet. Where did you get that? A long story. I'm keeping it for the Prince. - What Prince? - I'm not sure. But here is his picture. Your mother took to him at once and asked him to free you from Sarastro. I've come before him. Tamino is in love with you. Tamino, in love with me? Then why is he not here? We've been looking separately. A bird showed me the way. What time is it? Sarastro will be home any minute now. Come. - Sarastro? Was he the cad? - No. His servant, Monostatos. - Lf you knew. - I can imagine. He looked a real... So he is. Come, we must hurry. How do I know you're not one of Sarastro's evil spirits? Me? Why, I'm the best spirit in the world. - You do look good-hearted. - That's for sure. But hurry now. Anyway, what do I want with a heart? When I think that Papageno still has no Papagena... Not even a girlfriend to share my merry moments with. - You'll soon find a sweetheart. - I'll tell you one thing. Though... A man by gentle love inspired will have a heart that's kind and good to listen to his heart's desires How sweet the lot of womanhood For love will warm us day and night Love is the source os true delight Love brings relief in pain and sorrow It soothes a soul in misery Love holds the key to each tomorrow In it is Born Eternity For love's sweet sake the world began Woman and man, thus love began Love is pure and love is bright Lover's are each other's light Heaven both them both unite This path will lead you to your goal If you pay heed to this expedient Here are the rules; don't lose control Be steadfast silent and obedient But listen, tell me first, you three When will Pamina be set free? We must not tell, no use to plead Be steadfast, silent and obedient Obey the rules and you will succeed if you make use of this expedient I strongly feel it would be wise for me to do as they advise Where am I now? Which path is right? And could this be a godly site? The gates and the columns, their towering beauty would point to a reign of art, wisdom and duty Where art is protected and beauty may dwell the people are happy, the master rules well Alone I shall venture to open the door My purpose is noble, my motives are pure Sarastro,, ark these words, you scum To save Pamina I have come Stand back Stand back? I'll try another door Stand back The same words as before One single entrance is left. Now shall I be dismissed once more? Bold stranger, pray, what do you want? What brings you to this sanctuary? I seek the mistress of my heart A worthy cause, it would appear And yet you will not be admitted It isn't love that brings you here To evil powers you have submitted Revenge on the barbarian! In our company you won't find him Sarastro, is he not your leader? Oh yes, Sarastro rules these parts But surely not the Temple here? Oh yes, he rules the Temple here Then all must be hypocrisy So you would leave us now? I want to leave. Yes, begone... gone from deceit and fraud What do you mean by that? Will you explain yourself? Sarastro rules here. That's enough for me. If life is dear to you, then speak now. Tell me all - Sarastro you abhor? - I loathe his very name He is a great and holy man - He is a tyrant and a brute You suffer from a misconception The victim of his vile deception told me Sarastro stole her child That woman would have you beguiled Her venom poisons every word And you believe what you have heard? If Sarastro now were here then he could make his purpose clear Well, it's obvious to me Am I erroneously instructed? Pamina, was she not abducted? That's correct, yes I agree Where is she? Still alive and well? Or is she dead? What have they done? Be patient yet a while, my son I am instructed not to tell Explain this puzzle. Tell me now I'm still obliged to keep my vow But when am I to know the answer? As soon as it is understood that you shall join our brotherhood Oh endless night you never lighten When will the darkness ever brighten? Soon or never evemore... Soon or never, did they not say? You hidden spirits, answer me if yet Pamina lives Pa mi na is alive Yet alive? I thank you for that word Oh that my voice in jubilation could sing your praise and exaltation... Almighty Ones, I'd thus impart the feeling of relief in my heart What power in your gentle voice sweet flute of magic For your tones so soft and tender a heaven here on earth engender what power in your gentle sound Your voice is full of magic splendor For your tones so soft engender on earth a blissful heaven... But... my Pamina My Pamina does not hear My Pamina is not here Pamina! Pamina! Hear me, hear me now In vain... Where? Where? Pray tell, where can you be? Ah, that is Papageno's flute Perhaps she's coming here with him Yes, she has heard my melody she heard my flute My darling will be free The flute will bring her here to me Fearless heart and nimble feet make for a discreet retreat Oh, Tamino, hurry now, or they'll get us anyhow Oh Tamino, hurry, hurry now Or they'll get us, get us, get us anyhow Come, Tamino Wait a minute, maybe we should take a chance here Oh what joy to hear him answer. He has heard us, he is near And his flute is pure and clear Could this be the end of worry? Better hurry better hurry Ha! Seems like you both are caught! Bring me manacles ans fetters... you have lost out to your betters Now I'll teach you to deceive me. You will smart for this, believe me Hurry up with chains and rope - Shal we really give up hope? - Hurry up with chains and rope Faint hearts never won a single thing Little bells, let's hear you ring. We must really take a chance Let us risk a sing and dance How sweet is their tinkle, how tender and gay If only forever the music would play sweetly chiming bells, your worth is beyond all measure Would that every man on earth owned so dear a treasure Then to your harmonious sound love would fiourish all around It would mean the end of strife, fear and violations Man would lead a peaceful life Love would heal the nations We praise thee, Sarastro. Long live our master What now will befall us? What awful disaster? My friend, this is the end, I fear We soon shall have Sarastro here Oh, if I were a mouse I'd find hole to hide in Or if a snail, I'd glide into my little house Oh dear Whatever shall we say? Be honest and truthful Honest, come what may Long life to Sarastro. We praise his decisions We hail our master, his heavenly visions He wisely decides and gladly obey he is our prophet, he shows us the way Sir... I confess, I disobeyed... escaped, because I was afraid The blame, though, should not rest with me The wicked Moor sought to abuse me and that is why I tried to fiee Arise, you have no need to fear me I do not ask for a confession a reason why you would depart I know the secret of your heart yes, the secret of your heart You acted under love's impression and yet I cannot set you free You acted under love's impression and... and yet I cannot set you free My mother grieves for losing me Oh, my poor mother She is within my power Your life is wasted from the hour that you are left to her devices She is my mother, that suffices I love her She is proud and weak It is a man you need to guide you Advice from me you now must seek My proud youngster, come this way, our lord Sarastro to obey - It's he. - It's he. Yes, it is he Oh, can it be My arms must reach out to you and if I die for what I do... - This is peculiar. - Have you no shame at all? This is indecent, let go at once! See your servant kneel before you For my reward I now implore you to punish the audacious lad You must know the plans he had? To snatch her was his foul intention until made my intervention - I beg you, hear me now, o Lord. - Yes, you deserve a just reward. - For this good man I will allow. - Accept my gratitude, O Lord. Forty lashes now Oh no Spare me your thanks, It is but my task. Long life to Sarastro. We praise his decisions We hail our master his heavenly visions Now for probation lead these two into the Temple to be tried And let their eyes be veiled from sight until their hearts are purified Where virtue and benevolence are given such preeminence this heavenly affinity yes, heavenly affinity does Grant to man divinity ACT II Friends and brothers I solemnly declare this assembly to be of the utmost importance. Tamino is waiting by the north gate. He intensely desires to find a goal and purpose in life... and aspires to become a member of our brotherhood. - Is he virtuous? - He is. - Is he fearless? - He is. Is the reticent? You deem him worthy, do you not? Yes. For Tamino, I have destined my daughter Pamina. Therefore I took her away from her mother, the arrogant creature. She would have our Temple reduced to ashes... and destroy the holy writ of wisdom! Her ultimate purpose is to control the world. Pamina and Tamino shall protect our holy principles. You want them to rule together over our alliance and our kingdom? In true love you shall find the origin of wisdom. That is why I shall resign my power to Pamina and Tamino... if they show themselves worthy and endure their appointed trials. Brothers, do you approve of my decision? Yes. Ye gods of light for your assistance to this young pair we now appeal Lend them your wisdom and persistence Thus guide them through their harsh ordeal For their pains richly requite them But if the scythe of Death should smite them... let them when mortal life shall cease dwell in your everlasting peace Let Tamino and his companion be brought to the House of Trials. You may still turn back, but one more step... and it is too late. I strive for wisdom. Pamina's love will be my reward. You are prepared, then to endure the three trials? Would you, too strive to obtain wisdom? Pardon? What was that again...? - Would you atrive to abtain wisdom? - No thank you. A good night's sleep. Good food and drink, that'll do me. But suppose we could find you a pretty and virtuous wife? Yes. Well, no thanks. Not even is Sarastro has a girl lined up for you... one quite like yourself in coloring and dress? Like me? - Is she Young? - Young and pretty. What's her name? Papagena Really? I'd like to see her. Yes, but you must not speak to her until your three trials are over. Will you be steadfast enough to curb your tongue? Then you shall see her. Come in here. The people he sends me. Soon, you shall meet your first trial. Tamino, isn't it awfully dark? Why, are you fools enough to stay? Tamino, you are bound to die now. You Papageno, too, better fly now. - No, don't tell me things like that. - Papageno, no more chat. This is only a temptation. Don't engage in conversation. - We are lost! Did you not hear? - Do not talk and do not fear. Do not talk and do not fear. Soon you shall see Her Majesty for she has come here secretly - She Has? Then where is she? - Be quiet, do not talk. Think about the oath you swore now and don't break it any more now. Tamino, don't be so confiding. The Queen's advice to you was good An evil spirit is presiding over this "sacred"brotherhood A wise man trusts himself alone and forms opinions of his own It's also said the Devil feasts upon the victims of the priests The Devil feasts down there below Tamino, is that so? A wise man feels no need to talk because of vile, malicious talk - To trust the Queen I am inclined. - A Queen still has a woman's mind. Trust me instead and speak no more Think of the solemn oath you swore Your manner seems aloof and distant Why, Papageno, so resistant? - It isn't that I would... - Hush! - But he believes I should... - Hush! Oh, what a difficult position My sense of duty is too small This is indeed a hopeless mission They cannot be provoked at all They have indeed a hopeless mission We cannot be provoked at all The strong are different from the weak... in that they think before they speak They always think before they speak Our sanctuary desecrated! To suffer in hell you are fated Oh woe, oh woe, is me What's the matter? Pull yourself together now. Be a man. Man be damned! Why must I endure all these torments? If gods intend Papagena for me, why all these nightmares? Come now. I have orders to lead you on. On this endless journey love may be lost on the way Come on I don't trust him Everywhere in sweet seclusion lovers cuddle, bill, and coo I alone must face exclusion for my skin's a darkish hue Must I be forever burning and be scoffed at for my lust? Women spurn my ardent yearning, It arouses but disgust Oh, to have this maiden love me though of course she is taboo Gentle moon up there above me she is white and fair like you Though she find me reprehensive I shall own her here tonight Should you think it too offensive gentle moon, put out your light Mother, have you come to take me home? What is it? Why are you looking at me like that? It makes me frightaned, Mother Revenge and hate are raging in my bosom With desperation... With desperation I am torn apart You now must kill Sarastro to avenge me Yes, kill him to avenge me or be disowned forever in my heart Disowned by me forever you shall be You shall be disowned by me Forever you shall be disowned by me You shall be plagued forever cursed and renounced forever I ruthlessly shall sever every bond between us both I'll curse you forever I shall sever every bond between us both If by your hand Saratro does not perish Gods of vengeance hear a mother's oath Confide in me now What are you afraid of? My love? - Or your plans of murder? - Then you know? Everything. You and your mother are in my power now There is only one way to save yourself and her or you must die Pamina, what's the matter? Father, do not revenge yourself on my mother. Revenge? You must have had a nightmare. I'll sit here beside you until you've calmed down. Within these sacred portals... revenge and hate must cease. The souls os straying mortals... in love will find release. When guided by a brother's hand... they soon shall find a better land No wrath may be permitted... within those sacred walls No guille may be admitted... into these hallowed halls He who will not forgive his foe condemns himself to grief and love The time has come for your second trial. Don't forget: "Silence" - Where is Pamina, then? - You will soon see her. But you must not speak to her. Papageno, whoever breaks the silence here is punished by the gods. Yes, but... - Tamino, have you seen... - Ssh! I wish I were back in the woods. At least I might hear a bird. There is a missing feature... in Papageno's life A tender little creature to be my wedded wife her kiss would prevent me from thinking of trifles like eating and drinking Oh, love is a marvelous thing A beggar may feel like a king Why bother with eating and drinking Oh, love is a marvelous thing A beggar may feel like a king I shall feel like a king There is a missing feature in Papageno's life A tender little creature to be my wedded wife But nobody seems to select me In fact, they all seem to neglect me To end up as nobody's groom... Oh my, what a picture of gloom I wonder why they all reject me? To end up as nobody's mate Oh my, what a tedious fate How long must I wait? Not even a drop of water to drink For me? Is this a treat you offer all strangers? I suppose visitors don't pften bother you, then. That's what I thought. Come, keep me company. Lessen my boredom. How old are you? How old? Eighteen years and two minutes. As young as that? - I suppose you have a sweetheart? - You bet. Is he also as young as you? Well, he is about ten years older. Ten years older... that's love for you. What his name, then? His name is Papageno. Where is he then, your Papageno? Right here. Then I am your sweetheart. What's your name? My name is Papagena. Papagena! But you are sad? Why won't you speak to your Pamina? Tamino, don't you love me any more? Don't you love me any more? Brief and bitter seems my rapture for my bliss will not last If your heart I failed to capture joy must be forever past I am weary and my heart is full of grief If my love be unrequited only death, then only death may bring relief Sweet relief... Soon golden rays in sweet profusion will drive away the night Disperse tha clouds of dark delusion let wisdom shine its light Oh, blissful peace, have pity on us Descend and shine your light upon us This heavenly affinity does grant to man divinity Yes, grant to man divinity Yet look, despair torments Pamina So desperate we've never seen her She feels rejected and forsaken and does not know she is mistaken Poor girl, it really is a shame If only her dear Tamino came Oh well, perhaps we'd better stand aside to see what she might now decide So you are now my groom-to-be Well then, sweet dagger, set me free Although her meaning is not plain she seems to verge on the insane Beloved, we shall never part Forever now I'll keep you safety in my heart She is utterly demented Suicide must be prevented Dear Pamina Iook at us No, I will be severed thus from the man who did so hurt me and did bitterly desert me Mother gave me this knife It's a sin to take one's life I prefer the shorter anguish. Under grief I'll slowly languish Mother, mother you sacrifice me From your curse I cannot fiee Come with us and all is well No, I hear the distant knell You who failed me, now farewell Soon Pamina's death you'll see Then you'll have murdered her Stop! A warning's overdue If Tamino saw your error he would simply die of terror for he loves no one but you If he loves me, then how could he turn his back on me, why would he? Yes, why did he turn away? And why would he never answer? We may give no explanation but a sample illustration of this ardor we may show Come and see what he endures for the sake of you and yours - To Tamino let us go. - Hurry now, I miss him so Two hearts that love have conjugated cannot by man be separated They need not even fear a foe The gods protect them where they go Dearest, darling little sweetheart It's futile. Woe, now she has vanished Through my own fault now I am banished I plain forgot talking was unauthorized therefore have I been penalized Since she appeared before my sight since I was pierced by Cupid's dart throbbing away both day and night is my poor heart Papagena, hear my plea Papagena, come to me No, she doen't care about me. Seems they all can do without me I did hope to get a wife... Now a rope shall end my life Now this tree will do me nicely Suits my purposes precisely This will be my last adieu. Cruel world, goodbye to you You could tease me and torment me but not with a girl present me I'm as wretched as can be. Pretty maidens, think of me Pretty maidens, think of me Will not one among you take me? Think how happy it would make me There is time to snatch me yet Now what answer shall I get? There's no answer, no replying nobody replying. No one cares that I am dying Papageno, now's the time. Face your death and start to climb I make no move. I still make no move Now, let's see. If I should but count to three One Two Now, what am I waiting for? I must hesitate no more I shall on earth no longer dwell Now you faithless world, farewell You fool Oh Papageno, stop it. Why? Your only life is lost if you should die Spare me your witty moralizing You wouldn't be so patronizing if you were old enough to know Maybe you wouldn't feel so tragic if you had used your bells of magic Now, how could I forget about them? No wonder that I fail without them My little bells, ring sweetly for me and call my darling girl to me Tingle bells, and jingle. Bring my little dove Tingle bells, and jingle. Bring my only love Now, Papageno, turn and see - Will you now be mine forever? - I belong to you forever - Then I'll be your tender hubby - And I'll be your little missus Oh, to think of future joys If the gods their Grace award us in due time they will accord us a lovely brood of girls and boys girls and boys - First comes a little Papageno - Then comes a little Papagena - Then yet another Papageno - Then yet another Papagena We do not need a lucky penny With many, many, many, many, Papagenos, Papagenas we shall be fortunate indeed Your father permits you to visit Tamino in the House of Trials You are to give him his flute My task is to show you the way. Come Oh, comrades in our brotherhood see what splendor when clouds of night to conquering light surrender Fair dawn, to your delight our friend Tamino wakes Soon to our sacred band he swears allegiance He is a bold and virtuous youth Soon... Soon he'll be worthy of the Truth Tamino, your third and most difficult task remains Let him who seeks the light the truth shall aspire progress through earth and water air and fire He who endures this deadly passage to the end thus purified to heaven will ascend The gods of wisdom shall his eyes unseal and thus to him the mystery of life reveal I do not fear the unknown yonder The virtuous path I long to wander O Death, unlock your fearful gate Your trials boldly I await Tamino, stay I'll go with you Do I hear Pamina calling? Oh yes, that was Pamina calling Oh joy... now she will come with me Now each will keep the other's heart in life or death no more to part Do I still have to keep my silence? No, you are now released from silence What joy to wander hand in hand into a truly promissed land Two lovers who have death defied to them no favors are denied Tamino mine Oh, bliss divine! Pamina mine Oh, bliss divine! Beyond these gates I fear we shall see black death abide But I shall have you near me and face him by your side Let me your guardian be My love is leading me Our path with roses love adorns There must be roses with the thorns Now take your magic flute and play It will protect us on our way My father once a midnight hour did wander in the sacred bower He carved it from the ancient oak mid termpest roar and thunderstroke So threfore take the flute and play for it will shield us on our way Enlivened by its magic might we'll wander through the realm of night Our passage through the scorching fire the flute did aid us to endure Against the waves we would require its help again to feel secure O Gods! A moment such as this inaugurates eternal bliss Rejoice. Rejoice, triumphant pair! You have subdued death and despair and shall initiated be! Advance, advance Advance into our sanctuary Be quiet now, be quiet Soon we shall break into the shrine My queen, now keep your word and grant me that your Pamina will be mine I'll keep my word and I will shortly to you Pamina's hand assign Hush, do you hear a dreadful rumbling as of a roaring waterfall? Or as if stones and rocks were tumbling an echo of a thundering braw! Sarastro shall regret my lashes His temple shall be burnt to ashes He and his sighteous brotherhood are soon to be destroyed for good Queen of the night, just raise your hand We will obey every command Our power is shattered, our might is destroyed Our bodies are hurled into the void The radiant sun overpowers the night and darkness surrenders to wisdom and light Hail, ye true and faithful Your glory prevails Thanks Thanks Thanks to you, Sarastro We bid you farewell Victorius Truth will enhance His renown with Beauty and Virtue both sharing his crown
