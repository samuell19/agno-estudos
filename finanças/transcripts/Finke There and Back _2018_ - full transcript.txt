(flames crackling) (fingers snapping) (applauding) - [Man] I don't think there's an event I've ever been to that's as crazy and as spectacular as this one. - [Man] It's hard to put into words, isn't it? It's hard to say, oh this is what it's like, mate. You can't tell people, they have to live it. - [Man] It's just a different thing altogether. - [Man] It's the intensity of the race event that sets it apart. (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) - [Man] Dashing through the scrub and desert. - [Woman] It's like the unknown is the race. (engines buzzing) (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] Yankie Mike Alpha, Yankie Mike Alpha, this is Race Control, over. Yankie Mike Alpha, we've got reports of multiple riders down around the 100 kilometre mark. (helicopter buzzing) We've got ah, one of the helicopters, Yankie Mike Alpha, is on its way there, over. - [Narrator] Majestic, ancient landforms surround the middle of Australia. Hills that were once taller than Mt. Everest have been worn down over millions of years. This beautiful, harsh desert is God's country. A thin, sandy track stretches to the south, beyond the horizon. After 230 kilometres, it reaches the dry bed of the Finke River, the oldest river in the world. Once a year, the track flows, as motorbikes and cars race there and back. (upbeat music) The race starts near the town of Alice Springs, an unexpected oasis in the middle of Australia. (upbeat music) Riders and drivers gather every June for one of the biggest off-road races in the world. The energy has been described as Finke Fever. And it's contagious, people who come once, come again. (engine rumbling) (alarm beeping) - [Isaac] My kitten's name is Maverick Noodle. Maverick is obviously, he's not scared, and Noodle is that he's a bit of an idiot. So I'm pretty sure he's going to get himself into some trouble at some point. I like it when cats fail at being cats, when they go to jump on something and fall on their face I work from home a lot, teach some days. Melbourne is just full of concrete and bullshit. I have this constant search for adrenalin, which is really hard to get down here. And so, that's what bike riding does. Bike riding is an adrenalin outlet that you don't get doing anything else. I think bikes get in your blood or something and then you can't get rid of them. (chuckling) (laid back music) (engine starting) - I heard friends talk about the Finke. I always thought it would be a good idea. It's going to be an adventure, I like adventure. I haven't ever done any desert racing before. Not like expecting to go and win anything, but if I can go and finish, it'll be pretty cool. I guess I just like retro stuff. New stuff is just, I don't know, it all seems just, seems to be a bit the same. (laid back music) This is the lounge room. Got the old Macarena. It's good for watching old western cowboy movies on. The van, that's a International Harvester Company. Eventually, we're going to have a go and I put another motor in, and just put it in here at the moment. I put a bed in it, it's my bedroom at the moment. I only got called Gareth when I was in trouble. So my father said look at this scruffy kid one time, and it just kind of stuck. I grew up on a farm and my old man had the AG bike and I'd sit on the fuel tank and we'd go out and check the cows. So I wonder if he's to blame. (engine rumbling) I could live without motorbikes, but it seems silly to do that, if you can live with them. Like they're pretty good. (laughing) Cheers. That's what I'm racing this year, yeah, possibly one of my favourite bikes. I don't like to have favourites, but it's very close to being a favourite. Yeah, should be good. June '64 this is. (chuckling) The MFA Motel Federation to tell you where there's a motel. It's very good, excellent. - [Man] You've got a lot of maps. - Yeah, I like maps. A photo of my daughters, when they were very young. Oh cool, yeah, this one is pretty good. So we're here, I think it's up here somewhere. - [Narrator] Scruff leaves Sydney and drives 3,000 kilometres into the heart of Australia. The Finke Desert Race takes place over two days. On day one, cars followed by bikes head 230 kilometres south, where everyone camps the night. The next day, they race along the same track, back to where they began. Australia has the largest population of feral camels in the world. Central Australia was founded on the back of these camels. A hundred years ago, a railway took their place. The Finke Desert Race began in 1976, with a few locals following the path of the railway line. - The first race was There and Back Finke Desert Race. - It was a very casual race. So they'd prop their bikes up on a stick or a stand or whatever, go back about 20 metres, shotgun. - Bang. (gun firing) Run like hell, jump on the bike, kick and just this enormous line of bikes just feeding onto the track. - So the race used to go from side to side of the road. And there were numerous near misses, jumping the track and driving over the bonnets of tourists' vehicles, wondering what the hell was that? (yelling) The Finke Community Hotel was open. - The pub was well attended. And then they'd ride back the next day feeling, I imagine, viciously unwell. - It was just that adventurous spirit of what have these guys actually gone off and done? This course was dominated by bikes. There was no car available that was going to beat them. - [Narrator] Cars were introduced in 1988. Surrounded by a roll cage, some say they're a safer option for the bike riders who've grown soft. - [Geoff] We weren't that keen on it. But I think over time, it has benefited the event. The first lot of cars were similar to the first lot of bikes. They were backyard stuff. - [Man] Most of the buggies were a bit prehistoric. The technology wasn't there. But certainly now, the technology is there. (engine rumbling) - [Man] He's very expensive. - [Man] Those boys will be battling their wallets and their cars. - Just about need a bottomless pit. They must mortgage their house or something. (chuckling) (engine revving) - [Narrator] These are the high-rollers of off-road racing. With cars costing in excess of half a million dollars, money is no obstacle in the determination to beat the desert. (dramatic music) - [Ben] People want to go and see gunslingers. They don't want to see people in armoured vehicles. Dirt bike riders are like bad boys. Look how fast that big, brave man in that $300,000 buggy is going, you know? - We don't actually ever compare the two. - It's a bike weekend, man. It's all about the bikes. (phone ringing) - Good morning, Finke office. So today is the 31st of January and our bike entry division is opening. 500 positions available. Everyone is pretty keen to try and get their entry in today, so they don't miss out. Cheers, thank, bye-bye. (phone ringing) Good morning, Finke office. (aeroplane whooshing) - I used to do this without tools, but then it fell off once, when I was driving. I don't have a handbrake. I have a foot-operated handbrake, so I'm fucked. - [Narrator] Isaac Elliott arrives back in Alice Springs, the town where he grew up. He's planning to complete the race he started many years ago. - How you going? - How are you? - Not bad. - So, we've got the bike in the workshop at the moment. - I haven't had a bike for years. Why do I want to race this year? I don't know. I miss having some sort of adrenalin outlet, right? (engine revving) Whoa. (laughing) That's what it is, I guess, at the moment. - I mean I'm sitting there one day and I'm having a beer and I can just see this young fella come screaming down the hill. It's like I've just seen this out of the corner of the window. I was like, what? And then he's disappeared. I thought, where the hell? - So I rode little BMX bikes since I was a little kid. Crashed them and I'd go to hospital with head cuts. (clanging) (laughing) - What was that? - I don't know. - Nothing frightened him. - Yeah, nothing. - Nothing frightened him, you know? - Yeah, didn't care. (laughing) - [Isaac] Had 30 something stitches in my head before I was five. - That was sick. - Whoa. - I think initially, he was just mad and then obviously doing so, you know-- - [Jamie] So often. - So often he got skilled, so yeah. - He was extremely competent as a motocross rider. Watch out, don't be in front of him. He'll run you over. (laughing) Well, that was Isaac, just a hundred percent. - [Man] Whoa. - Yeah. - Whoa. - [Man] Yeah. - [Zoran] Like he was just a hundred percent. There was nothing else on his mind. - This just dream of being a pro motocross rider. It's a very childlike dream. And if you're not getting there when you're 16, 17, 18, you're probably not going to get there. And if you were chasing that, 19, 20, 21, 22, you're just delaying growing up. (blues music) - [Toby] Lucky enough, I walked away with a number one plate. So, definitely a big show-up for my first attempt. - [Narrator] Toby Price was the first Australian to win the Dakar Rally in South America. He's also the reigning Finke King of the Desert and has won the race five times. - So, this pretty much is the house, where I don't get to spend too much time in. But, it's not too often you see a dirt bike in the middle of your lounge room or anything like that. So, this year, we're trying to chase number six on the bike, which will then hopefully give us a record for the most wins at Finke. - [Narrator] Toby is the lead rider for KTM, a European manufacturer and the most dominant team at Finke in recent years. (helicopter buzzing) Unfortunately, after breaking his leg only a few months ago, he's had to pull out of this year's race. He's here to lend support to the team. Alice Springs local, David Walsh, who came third last year, has now become the lead rider for KTM. There's big pressure on David to bring home a win for the town, as a local has not won Finke in 11 years. - I'd like to be on the podium again. Obviously, top spot would be preferred, but. Yeah, I have a dream where I've won the event before and you wake up disappointed. (laughing) (engine rumbling) - [Narrator] Competitors practise the track for six months leading up to the big weekend. This is called pre-running. It gives them track knowledge vital for having an edge over the competition. - [David] Bike fitness is so different to everything else. I mean you can do a lot of training. But unless you're spending time on the bike, you know, it's unique fitness. I've done over 6,000 Ks up and down the track in 20 days. - [Narrator] The KTM Team arrives at the end of the track, at the small community of Apatula on the Finke River. - Yeah, there is a little tacker on it. - It would sort of twitch and then it would just throw that rear end. And then that's why I was having, I'm pretty that's why I was having-- - [Narrator] The teams other riders, a 21 year old Jack Simpson from Victoria, and another Alice Springs local, Luke Hayes. - Loser. (laughing) - Plus - Sweet. - Plus whatever it would be to do the most at. (camera shutter snapping) - Hey, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Here you go. (chattering) Oh yeah, okay. (chattering) (helicopter buzzing) - For David Walsh, racing is a labour of love. Being a full-time builder occupies most of his time - I've made all the screws and that we'll just pick them all up. Ready to go, mate? - Guess so. - And you're ready? - [David] There's no real slow parts on the track. So, you come off, it generally involves an injury. I've fractured six vertebraes, broke my sternum, my collarbone in a crash. She's seen the ugly side of it too so she's not a big fan of my racing. - It's the fastest desert race, it's crazy speeds. And to go that fast, you've either got to be crazy or, you know, just want it that bad. But it's what he loves. And he is good at it, regardless of all the injuries. Each year when it's the last year, then next year, oh it's the last year, and so on and so forth. So, this year is the last year. (laughing) - Alright. - Bye. - [David] Love you, be good. - [Daughter] Yeah. - See you, mate. - See you. Love you. - I've got a family and that now. The risk is pretty high, considering it's, you know, a hobby for me. So, touch wood, (laughing) I'm going to have a good year. - [Narrator] David's main rival is another Alice Springs local and Yamaha rider, Daymon Stokie, who finished fourth last year. A crash a few months ago shattered the fingers in his left hand and he's still unsure if he'll be able to race. - [Daymon] So, I've been like trying to, yeah, just massage it a few times a day as well. - Yeah, perfect, good. Can I get you to bend your knuckle joints for me? Beautiful. - But yeah, on the one hand, I'm like oh, it's coming along pretty good, I've got time. And then on the other hand, I'm like I've got no time, I'm freaking out, it's not getting better, so - [Woman] Yeah. - [Narrator] Two weeks before the race, the Yamaha Team is pre-running. Daymon Stokie is going for his first ride to see if he'll be able to compete with his broken hand. (engine rumbling) - This is where our preparation counts. It is a big expectation to win. And it would be damn nice to get that number one spot. We're judged by everyone at every level, from those who fund us, to those who watch us. He's had surgery, they've plated it, but that doesn't mean the pain goes away. - At the end of the day it's two hours of your life each way. You've just got to bite your lip and go. (engine rumbling) - [Daymon] I've said, oh this is my last year a few times now, but I keep coming back. I've had a lot of big crashes down here now and it hasn't turned me off at all. - There you go, that's a Yamaha right there. - Well, the headline in the newspaper is already Walshie has got this. And if you went off last year's results, yeah, he's the favourite. (laid back music) - [Mary] But I tell you what, it's a big thing for the town. Everybody is behind it, it's not just the riders. Finke is the town, isn't it? - [Man] Hey, look, we were talking earlier about how there's only just under 50 locals in the event. - The cream rises to the top. We don't have to have hundreds of us in there. We've got the qualities. What more do we want? (chuckling) - So, Daymon Walsh (ah), Daymon Stokie, Luke Hayes, this is the, a very wide-open event that we have this year. - Actually, there's some silent ones that come in. (chuckling) (laid back music) - So, the Finke Track from here, we're only about five Ks from it, I'd say. And the homestead where I grew up is only another three or four K down the road. Spent my whole life within 10 kilometres of the Finke Track. Yeah. - [Narrator] 22 year old local, Luke Hayes, has been riding motorbikes since before he could walk. - [Luke] 1998 was the year my Dad came third outright. You know I was just a kid at that point I would've been ah three or four years old. - Gonna win? - Hope so. Yeah, I hope I win. The bike is fast enough to win. Just, I hope I can hang onto it for the full distance. (cows mooing) - Billy worked on the land. The track runs through his family's cattle station where he grew up. - Dad used to, you know, in training for Finke, he used to run up and down this road, and I used to follow him on my little Z50 Honda, yeah, down to the gate. And Dad, always being a station bloke, when he was racing, I think he probably took an element of pride in being a ringer on a dirt bike, you know, and having a good crack. (blues music) - There's a number of riders have gone down to Finke today. So, all the riders keep an eye out for me and they always give me a big thumbs-up. They love the work that I do, because it, (laughing) it saves them bashing themselves to pieces on this track. What happens in this stuff, the riders call it choppy. And then if they hit a big square edge, it normally puts their arse through their brain. (laughing) I'm a bit daggy with my braces, but it's the only way to keep my trousers on. The track is so bloody rough. (laughing) - Look, these arrows are just some small bends, 90 degree bends, danger sign. We've got a square on the white background. - A desert race isn't racing on the road. It's out in the sand dunes, out in the whoops. Whoops are like giant corrugations that develop from the bike loading up suspension and then compressing suspension. Just having this adrenalin rush at over 100 K an hour, that was 1990. I said, no, I'm entering Finke. Entered the first set of whoops, launched up into a tree, fell out of the tree, broken collarbone and three broken ribs. That was my first taste of whoops. - I don't want to take all these, obviously. I'm just picking out a few. Oh, I found one on the road too this morning. That's a good-looking screw, metric. Some Allen keys, in case I get nervous. - [Narrator] Scruff has arrived in Alice Springs for his first attempt at the Finke Desert Race. - So that's a 1980 model. What's that, 37? Yeah, 37 years old. I ride old bikes, that's what I do. Oh, there we go. A lot of people make them all nice and neat and put them in the pool room. I make them neat enough and I ride 'em. (engine roaring) 1980, will it make it? Well, if they were making it in 1980 there's no reason it shouldn't get there and back. I've done a bit of desert riding, but I never imagined so many whoops could be in one place. Your arms are numb, lower back, you know, your legs. Everything is just, you know, at its limit. (blues music) I guess I'm getting a bit excited. I was kind of a bit nervous for a while. Oh I was thinking about like maybe something could go wrong, like a big crash or something like that. 10 years ago. I thought I'd be all like emotional looking at these. But it's like looking at a wrecked car before it's all fixed up. But it's the only car you've got. Is it these, these first ones? - These ones. Right there. - Do you think we're close? - I was selling my bike. I was not going to be a kid anymore. I was going to buy a house. That was, that was August 2007. Then I crashed my motorbike in April 2007. (unsettling music) And so, I came over a rise and there was a corner quickly after it. And knew I wasn't going to make it, so I just picked a line through the trees. But at the speed I was going, it kicked my back wheel out and my back wheel hit a tree. (engine rumbling) (clattering) Then I was lying in the ground. (laughing) I said, oi mate, "Get my legs out of the tree." And they said, "What are you talking about? "You're lying on your back on the ground." I said, "No, but they're, they're up in the tree." And it was just because I couldn't feel them lying on the ground. That was it. - It was around here somewhere, 10 years ago. Finke then becomes something that I haven't done and something that I should do. The challenge to go fuck you to everything here, basically, just go fuck you, I can race you. This is a point-to-point race. It's not a circuit race. So people will go from point A down to point B, camp overnight and then come back along the same course the following day, just in reverse. So, this is the biggest field we've ever had. So that produces additional logistical challenges for us. And primarily, that is getting everyone away and getting everyone in at the Finke end within daylight. The last thing we want to do is see anyone left out there at night, and we don't shut our Operations Centre down until we have everyone accounted for. - We get about 60 extra presentations to the Emergency Department over the weekend, of which about 20 are seriously injured. - Because sometimes those patients will actually need to be transported to Adelaide or to Darwin, because Alice Springs Hospital doesn't have neurosurgical facilities or cardiothoracic facilities. So, they may need care outside of the state. - If we do have something that happens on the track, like we had a few years ago where a person got killed, again, police will be responding to that. I'll set up a crime scene. This may mean that the competitors have to be redirected, and that's what we did last time. - We're fortunate that we've only had I think three fatalities over the 42 years. Sobering note to finish police on. Thank you. - [Man] We might just ask that question again. So how has Toby Price's absence from the bikes affected your Finke race? - We're all here to do the same job. You know, there's a few of us locals that are, you know, keen to take the title. So. - Yeah, I make it like that. (laughing) That was good. - [Narrator] KTM's newest recruit is 21 year old Jack Simpson, a professional rider from Victoria. - You either have it or you don't. I feel like I have it. You just have to get up there and ride it. And you've either got it or you don't. Fast as all hell, rough as all hell, dangerous as all hell. Like it's not easy. (engine rumbling) - [Narrator] Jack is heading down the track for his last pre-run. - I've broken a vertebrae in my back and two of the lower ribs and punctured a lung. I was about to hit top gear. Hit a square edge, went left, right, left, and I nearly saved the whole thing. And then I reckon I've dropped in a whoop and then it's just, yeah, sent me off to the right. The bike went left and tumbled and snapped the bars in half and ripped all the seat and sub frame and all that. And yeah, I was, I felt like I was flying in the air for five seconds. Definitely hurt when I hit. - [Man] How fast do you think you were going, Jack? - [Jack] Ah, probably 160 Ks. (siren blaring) - I want to thank you all, on behalf of St. John, for coming and giving up your weekend to help out with the Finke Race. It's a huge event and it will be very chaotic. You've got to remember, it's 220 Ks of 600 bikes spread out and it's not, it's not organised. Something is going to wrong. So this is definitely the biggest logistical event that we do every year. - A hundred are over 45 and looking to check things off their bucket list. A lot of them are very inexperienced and not quite used to these conditions and this type of race. - The most common fractured bone is the clavicle and they will insist on wanting to ride back with a broken clavicle or a broken wrist. Ruptured spleens, burst L3 L5, intracranial haemorrhages. Most bones have been broken here on this track. - Could I get a gourmet crispy Caesar salad? It's the same person that served me this morning. Thank you. 14 days until Finke. And I haven't sat on my bike. I'm not really worried about falling over. But I guess it's like when you're strapped to a bike, you've just got to get comfortable with it. We have to do a lot to a standard bike in order for me to race. So, when we rip this seat off, I'm sort of nervous that we have done the whole bike at once, really quickly, and that different things that won't be able to be changed won't work properly. And I know I can get into it and I'd rather be tight in it, than loose in it. Are you nervous, Isaac? A little bit, little bit nervous. (mumbling) Partly the fear is that I won't know how to ride a bike. - [Man] Yes, you look good there, that's-- - Like it looks quite central? - Yeah. - [Narrator] A few days before the big race, Alice Springs is buzzing with excitement. The town's Mayor, Damien Ryan, is one of the race's biggest fans. - Thanks. - You do know it's Finke time when boxes appear in my office with old programmes. I always remember this fellow, Stephen Gall, who's just a thorough champion. And I always remember him making a statement one year after he won it. He said, the hardest part of the course was the four inches between your ears. And he said, once you conquered that, you could go on and win it again. - [Man] Randall, moment of truth, how is it going to go? - Oh, the morning didn't start off too well, but hopefully, the rest of the day will go alright. - [Narrator] Randall Gregory holds the record for the most Finke wins in a row. On this track, he's considered by many to be the greatest of all time. (engines rumbling) - I heard the announcer call Randall Gregory over the line. And he said, this is something that will never be repeated. This is the best desert racer in the country that's just flown five in a row. - [Man] It's probably never going to happen again. It was just unheard of. - It was always a dream watching, you know, the likes of Randall Gregory. - [Man] One thing interesting about Randall there is he was never the favourite, yet he always won. - [Geoff] Everyone knew how good he was. He proved that on the track. The Finke Track was pretty much his. - I watched him when he passed me, one hand off the bars, thumbs up, cheers, mate. He was already popping the champagne in Alice. (engine roaring) - [Man] I don't think we ever knew how fast he could ride. He had an unfortunate accident on part of the Finke course. - And it happened not far from here, and I think it was Michael Vroom that found him and said, are you alright, mate? And he wasn't. - Well done. - [Rick] How many more could he have won? How far could he have gone? When would he have retired? Becomes part of the myth that is Randall Gregory. (dramatic music) - Yeah, I don't remember how it happened or why it happened. Look, I wasn't ready to finish up. When you're in rehab, there's a lot of people in there with different reasons why they're injured and mine was, you know, it's a sport. Take it on the chin, you know? You, you know, you don't have to do it, you know, it was your sport. If you're already in a chair, you don't want to make it any worse. - [Man] Ready, big fella? - No, no, I'm not. I can't feel from here. I've got no support, so this actually just basically holds me upright. Slightly lower than last time. Let go of my legs just around the outside. - Round the outside, round the outside. - [Isaac] Just like that, those on. (engine rumbling) - [Man] Oh shit. - I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's go, I just fucking stalled it. Well, I just, I don't really have a clutch. I want to ride back. - [Man] Let's do it, let's get in. - [Isaac] Oh. (talking drowned out by engine rumbling) (dramatic music) Everything I do is whether the world gives me permission to do it. The world doesn't give me permission to ride a bike, but I do it anyway. - [Narrator] A rider's connection to this ancient land runs deep. In God's country, time can slow down. (dramatic music) - [Man] The atmosphere is just beautiful out here. It's unlike anything else. - [Man] If you've had the most stressful day in the world, you get on the motorbike and all of a sudden, your day is not stressful anymore. - [Man] It's ballet on a motorbike. It's just pretty to watch. (dramatic music) (talking drowned out by engine rumbling) - How fucking crazy was that? (laughing) - [Isaac] Wow, that was a riot. I almost died a couple of times. - Yeah. - Not too many, maybe twice? - I got a speedo, I like it. - [Man] Did you read it? - Yeah. - What did it say? - We were doing 80 K, so why are we getting passed? We've got to go faster. When I was riding out there, I looked at it and I was like, I've done 44 kilometres on this bike to prepare for a 500 kilometre race. I can't admit that it's fun, because Finke is still the stupidest race. It's still ridiculous. (instrumental music) (grunting) - Alright now, hold still. (camera shutter clicking) - I haven't been lifting any weights or doing any star jumps. I'll just come and ride, you know? It does make the beer taste better. I think I should be able to finish. I don't think I'll be pushing Toby Price, broken leg or not. - Yeah, we unfortunately didn't quite make it here to the Finke Desert Race on the, on the two wheels and yeah, definitely it's hard to sit on the sidelines and watch. So we've taken a little bit of a different path this year at Finke. I want to keep racing anything I possibly can. I'll race a lawnmower if I have to. Sign the other one as well? No worries. - [Daymon] I'd say my main battle is my hand and racing myself, and I think the result will take care of itself. - [David] Half the battle is just beating the desert. - [Narrator] The desert population swells, as 15,000 spectators head down the track to camp over race weekend. - Oh. (laughing) Come, put it together. (chattering) - [Man] Yeah, na (laughing) - You don't want... We're in the territory. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] A well-known racer once said, if everything seems under control, then you're not going fast enough. Well, that's all well and good for someone who races in a controlled environment on a track you could eat your dinner off. The desert is unforgiving, it has its own plans. Spectators spread along the track wait in anticipation for the first vehicle to pass. - He's coming fast, you think, no shit. - Who is it, who is it, oh, who's next? Like, it's sort of that excitement. - [Man] You wait for the chopper and you can just see the speck in the distance, and you start to hear it. (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic music) - There, there. (engine roaring) - [Children] Whoa. - [Race Controller] We're at the Alice Springs end. We're about to get the bike race underway. - Motorcycling Australia advises that motorcycle racing can be dangerous. Your equipment could be damaged or destroyed and you may suffer serious personal injury, or worse. (chattering) - KTM have been on the top step for a while now so it'd be nice to push them off and get someone else up there. - [Commentator] The race is up for grabs today, regardless of who's on the line, who makes it, who has mechanical failures. There is a ridiculous level of fortune and misfortune that's involved with motor sport. - Probably more of a talking point, Jack Simpson, bike number 11. - Yeah. - Out of Steel as well. - I'll see you. - Going to Finke? Better. - Yeah, well hopefully. - I'll come looking for you. (hammering) - I think the first 40 Ks are a kind of dangerous section, because everyone is going to be a bit woohoo. (engines revving) - [Race Controller] All stations, all stations, this is Race Control. We're five minutes to start. - Hey, when I get nervous, I put on more padding. I've got yoga mats everywhere. - It's not bad for you. (engine rumbling) - [Narrator] The starting order is based on a short time trial the day before. Riders with the quickest time take off first, a big advantage, with dust-free air. - [Man] The feeling you get when you roll up to the line, it's electric. Your heart is in your mouth. The same kind of apprehension just before you're about to jump out of an aeroplane. - [Race Controller] The red light is on so that means one minute to go. (dramatic music) (engines revving) - [Commentator] Away they go. At the start, David Walsh on the KTM. Start straight here is nice, and then Ivan long goes wide. (engines rumbling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] One bike after another, they leave, until all 600 are on the track. (dramatic music) (engines rumbling) - [Man] Whoa. - [Narrator] Finke is raced on corrected time. Each rider is timed separately for the duration of their race. This means the lead rider is not necessarily the quickest. And sometimes a dark horse will come from behind. - [Commentator] We've got all bikes away, bar one. - [Commentator] We've got Isaac Elliott and his two ghost riders that are there to help him along the way, his brother Zoran, Jamie Lander is a good friend of his, will follow Isaac the whole way down on the X62. This guy is strapped into this motorcycle. (engine revving) - [Race Controller] All stations, this is Race Control. Isaac Elliott has now left the start line. - [Man] We knew that he wasn't going to cruise. (laughing) As soon as he puts his helmet on, it's race day, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's a different ball game. He'll go, yeah, no, I'm going to cruise down, yeah. Alright, let's race. (intense dramatic music) - [Narrator] 10 kilometres into the race, Isaac reaches the end of the field. One by one, he passes able-bodied riders. - Got the KTM team next to us. That's our arch rivals. We don't really get along. - [Jeff] You know, we have roughly sort of 40 people involved in the event and they really enjoy the atmosphere, the camaraderie. You know, we have-- - Excuse me, mate. Couple of Yammies coming through. (laughing) Are we meant to take this serious today? - [Narrator] KTM has won the last three years in a row. The Yamaha Team has not won since 1986. Future sales and their pride ride on a win. - [Race Controller] We've had number three go through, over. - [Race Controller] Three, we've got one coming through now. Hold on a second. - [Race Controller] We should be expecting the first bike through Deep Well any minute now. - [Commentator] David Walsh still leading the event. (dramatic music) - [Commentator] David Walsh, first bike, the local lad still holding the lead in this race. (engine rumbling) - [Race Controller] Walsh is in sight, Walsh is in sight. (helicopter buzzing) - Yeah. (engine roaring) (cheering) (chattering) (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] All stations, second bike through Deep Well checkpoint in 33 minutes, 09. And that is bike number four, Daymon Stokie. (intense dramatic music) - [Commentator] Next up, the second bike through Deep Well, Daymon Stokie, super quick. Well, he did it with a time of 33 minutes and nine seconds. Of course, we know Daymon Stokie has a hand injury coming into the event. (helicopter buzzing) - [Race Controller] Joel, that road ambulance should be down there within five or 10 minutes. (siren blaring) - [Narrator] Racers know that their luck could change at any time. The desert has a mind of its own. Over the next two days, 72 bikes and 103 cars won't finish. (clattering) - [Craig] You alright? You alright? - [Narrator] Chief Paramedic, Craig Garraway, sweeps the track for injured riders. He's been doing this for 20 years. - He was lucky enough, he got up, kept going. Hopefully won't find him too far up the road. (chuckling) - [Race Controller] Rodinga Race Control. - [Narrator] Only a few kilometres down the track-- - [Craig] What have we got here, mate? - [Narrator] Craig comes across the same rider. - Oh, I suspect he's broken his coccyx. Well, we're treating that line anyway. - [Craig] What do you want to do here? Do you want to get him back to your checkpoint and get a jet ranger to pick him up? - Yeah, it's probably for the best, mate, yeah. At this stage, I'm not concerned, I'm not going to go spinal, it's just more his back. That'll be great. (goofily vocalising) - We have bike rider 18 now, probably about a kilometre or two south of Rodinga. He's got a major fractured coccyx, alright? I'll ring you back. I've got another guy injured here as well. So, I'll ring you back, mate. - Picked a good spot to be. (laughing) - [Man] At the right time. - You'll be alright? - [Rider] Yeah, I'm good. Fucking me up with dirt though. (laughing) - [Man] Good luck. - Two, three, lift, bloody hell, you're a solid boy. - Big strong boy. - Yeah, I was going to say, you're a solid boy. - Well done - There, you're a movie star as well, eh? - [Man] We have dodged that many bullets, but to have so few fatalities, someone is smiling down on this race. (dramatic music) - [Commentator] They're coming through thick and fast through Rodinga now. The local boy, David Walsh, still leading the charge. - [Narrator] Racing Finke has been described as holding onto the edge of a cliff for two hours. (engine rumbling) - [Commentator] The race has been going for over an hour now. We should see our first bikes through Bundooma. (intense dramatic music) - [Race Controller] Deep Well has just confirmed that Isaac Elliott has passed through the first checkpoint. Back at the 80 kilometre mark, Isaac reaches his first fuel stop, also known as the Kirkville Pub. (cheering) - [Man] Do you want water? (talking over each other) - [Isaac] Kirkville! (cheering) (engine rumbling) Woo! - Bump start. - I know you want to stay for a beer, but get going. (engine rumbling) (cheering) - How you doing mate? - Let's get fucking blind. (chattering) - [Ben] People go to extreme lengths to have a good time. - We've got the keg here. I still need to hook it up. We've got the spit roast there. That's for the Sunday roast. We've got the pig hanging up there, it's defrosting. The burnout pad. (engine roaring) But the main attraction tonight would have to be turbulence. (talking over each other) (whooping) I don't think we'll have much commentating-- - We'll get Dusty, you're up. - Oh he's alright. (talking over each other) Alright, this young lad, Dustin Hunter. Now, this young kid can tell a few stories. (yelling) - [Man] Jesus. (cheering) (engines rumbling) - [Narrator] At the 160 kilometre mark, support crews of Yamaha and KTM wait for the first bike. - The big dog for KTM is pacing, it's going to be on. The fun dies off in this last 10 minutes of waiting. It sort of gets a little bit serious. And I'm not very good at serious. - [Race Controller] David has just gone past the one thirty. - Thank you. - See dust already? Let's get ready, boys. Let's fucking pump this. (helicopter buzzing) You got him? This will be Stokie. - [Jeff] There he is. - [Narrator] KTM's David Walsh still maintains the lead in the race. - Stop watch (chattering) - He was struggling to see the square edges. - Square edges, yeah. - Yeah. - Not much we can do for that, pray for him. - [Narrator] Yamaha's Daymon Stokie is not far behind. - [Daymon] How far is he away? How far is he away? Dust, come on. Groovy. - Well done, boys, time for beer. Yeah, what was the end time there? (helicopter buzzing) - Water. - Coming fourth is Luke Hayes. - [Man] Got it, got it. - [Race Controller] Finke, this is Race Control. Mt. Squires has just confirmed Luke Hayes has passed through their checkpoint. 27 years ago, Luke's father, Billy Hayes, raced along the same track. - Need some water? - Yeah. Jesus. - Dad followed me in the chopper there and back last year. So he was above me the entire way. And that was really cool, you know, sort of sharing that with him, I guess. He passed away only a month after. So, for me, that's one of the memories I think I'll hold dearest. There were so many conversations about what this year was going to bring and how we were going to approach it together. Now that he's not here, I still wanted to go after what we were going to go after together. He wouldn't want me to throw away a passion or an opportunity, being sad or beat-up about what happened. If I could have a conversation with him right now, he would say that don't let it slow you down. He's not following me in a chopper. But I know that he's there. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - Eight eight nine. (engines roaring) - [Anthony] Yeah, roger that, Henry Hill. We'll check the records. - [Narrator] At Race Control, event president Antony Yoffa searches for vehicles that haven't been accounted for. - So I've got three that aren't through Deep Well. And Mick hasn't seen a car for 20 minutes. Yeah, Deep Well, OSV3. They would be there, I gather, Over? - I'm checking if it actually did leave. - [Woman] Race Control say? - Yeah, it was due to go early. - Awesome, guys. - [Claire] One year, we had five competitors missing at the end of day one. And I went over to the Competitor Relations office, and all five men's wives and girlfriends were there, and they all were heavily pregnant. - Where is 475? Go ahead, this is Race Control. - Yeah that. - Yeah, alright. The toughest part about this event is when there's a catastrophic accident. And on my watch, there's been several losses of life, which ah no-one wants to see. Yeah, roger that, thanks, OSV2. That should be the last of them. So, just keep proceeding to Deep Well to clear the track. - [Commentator] Give you an update as they're getting closer and closer to the Finke checkpoint. Just three DNFs to confirm so far by the officials. - [Narrator] The cars have all arrived at Finke. Crowds now wait for the first bike. (helicopter buzzing) (applauding) (cheering) - [Commentator] It is the local hometown hero, David Walsh. - The sweat and the tears, but no blood, thankfully. - No, look, it was a pretty clean run, really good. Battled a flat rear for the last 30 and I was just come on, baby, get me there. It was pretty dangerous in some sections, but glad to be here in one piece, here we go. Who's this? (engine rumbling) - [Man] Here comes another one. (applauding) (cheering) (talking drown out by engine rumbling) - [Man] No. - [Man] Alright then mate? - Yeah, yeah alright. - Made it. - Made it. - Did you have any dramas? - No. - How's your hand? - Fuck man, it just fell apart like the last 100, eh? Like fucking couldn't even pull the clutch in, fuck. - That's huge. - That is massive. Yeah, I hit a bit rock back there and it just deflected straight back up. (applauding) - I had two near-death experiences. Oh. (chattering) - [Narrator] Daymon Stokie ices his broken hand. Only a few kilometres from the finish line, his teammate's motor expired. This sends alarm bells through the Yamaha camp. Their attention now turns to servicing Daymon's motor. He is now their only rider. - [Daymon] Cold in here, eh? Stick your hand in here for a minute, see how long you last. - [Boy] Oh. (speaking in language) (groaning) - Yeah. (laughing) Bro, that is so, so painful. (water splashing) (laughing) - [Man] Get in there, get in, get in. Get your arms in. (gasping) (laughing) - Walsh, that is criminal. - [Narrator] Now the race leaders have arrived, anxious families wait for their riders to make it safely. - [Woman] These are the people that've all come through. Sorry, hang on, let me just check. (ringing) - [Commentator] Top three guys were locals. This year's bike section of the Tatts Finke Desert Race, just a quick update on some DNFs Can't give you anymore information, apart from the fact that they have been as a Do Not Finish. Caleb Auricht is out, number nine, CRF 250. (dramatic music) - Which bike number are you off, mate? - [Man] I'm 588. - Right, so the rider of 588. - Try again, that's it. - No, mate, no, no, take it off. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yep, yep, yep. (helicopter buzzing) - [Craig] So what are we going to do with this guy? Okay, thank you. (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) - So I think that it would be safe enough in this situation. (cheering) (applauding) - There he is. - There he is. (applauding) (cheering) - [Race Controller] All stations, Isaac Elliott and his ghost riders have passed through Mt. Squires, the last checkpoint on the way to Finke. So look out and give him a big cheer. (dramatic music) (cheering) (applauding) (dramatic music) (laughing) - [Isaac] You get to the finish line and it's like you haven't breathed for 220 Ks and it's just this big breath. Like, I've made it. You feel like you've conquered this track and now you've just got to conquer it in the other direction. (upbeat music) - [Girl] Hello. - [Narrator] For those who crossed the finish line on day one there is a sigh of relief. But they are only halfway. Tomorrow, they will race back. Bike 163, first time competitor, Scruff Hamill, hasn't arrived at Finke. - [Race Controller] They're looking for bike 163, repeat, 163, Scruff Hamill. We don't have a record of him passing through either of your checkpoints. - Yeah, but we don't know where he was until he got here. We've lost him from Squires to here. - [Narrator] With the night-time temperature dropping below zero, race organisers must account for every rider. - 463 or 863? - No, 863. - 863. - [Race Controller] Mt. Squires and Finke checkpoints, this is Race Control. I'm still waiting on an update of bike 163, Scruff Hamill. I have no information as to his whereabouts. Can you come back to me? Over. (animal calling) - [Race Controller] Henry Hill, have you seen anyone come past yet? Over. (horn honking) - Hey are you Scruff? - Yeah. - [Woman] Oh my god. - I was rocking along really well and then a guy crashed in front of me, just out of Deep Well. And I stopped and was with him for like half an hour. I just laid my bike on the ground and then it just wouldn't go any good any more after that. I thought I'm just going to keep it running 'til it stops. And I did, and it stopped. So maybe I'll get it rocking for next year. Not what I've been saying the last few days, this is a one and only. But I feel a bit like I've not finished, kind of. Yeah, I guess I'll be back, yep. Oh, my foot, that's okay. Sweet, thank you, man. How are you, man? - [Man] Good, how are you going? (chuckling) - [Scruff] I've had better days, but I've had worse too. - [Narrator] For many of the 15,000 spectators spread along the track, the day rolls into the night. - [Man] He's fallen asleep in the chair, so we've just slowly been digging, shovel by shovel. - You rascal, you're a rascal. (laughing) - Tie it behind the waist. - What have we found here, you sleeping beauty? Drink, drink, drink, drink, - [Group] Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. (laughing) (cheering) (laughing) ♪ Have a beer with Duncan ♪ 'Cause Duncan's me mate, yeah ♪ - Hey! ♪ Oh I'd love to have a beer with Duncan. ♪ - [Man] Yeah! ♪ And we never ever ever get rollin' drunk ♪ ♪ We drink at the Town and Country ♪ ♪ Where the atmosphere is great ♪ ♪ I love to have a beer with Duncan. ♪ ♪ 'Cause Duncan's me mate ♪ I love to have a beer with Duncan ♪ ♪ 'Cause Duncan's me mate - We spent most of the first night at Finke at the pub. Got back to camp out when the pub shut. Continued to drink beer around a fire like this, 'til four-ish. And I think we were up at six-ish, because we raced at seven-ish. I don't know, it's a bit different now. It's a bit serious. (helicopter buzzing) - [Man] Get up. - No, fucking sore, no, we're good. (helicopter buzzing) Do you want to ride back for me? Can you ride back for me? - No. - No. Does that mean I have to do it? (laid back music) - [Narrator] With the cars well underway, the remaining bikes prepare to head back to where they began. - [Race Controller] All stations, this is Race Control. We're only moments away from a start on Race Day Two and David Walsh will be first rider away. - I think you can smell that beer at presso on the way home. (laughing) - [Race Controller] He's got a pack behind him, as they chase him back to Alice - Hand's pretty sore, so just looking forward to getting home. David's five minutes away, which is a pretty big gap, especially for me nursing my hand, to catch up to him. But I've got five minutes on third as well, so it's a bit of breathing room. - Keen to just get it home from here. Yeah, keen to just try to string together a smooth run home. - [Commentator] So who will that first bike be that crosses the finish line and will be crowned King of the Desert? - [Commentator] Three Alice Springs boys are filling the podium positions at the moment. The last time that happened was back in 1978. (suspenseful music) (engines rumbling) - [Race Controller] All stations, David Walsh has now left the start line. (engines rumbling) - [Commentator] All the bikes and riders are leaving from the Finke end. We're going to bring them all home this morning. - [Isaac] Oh, whoa, get pumped. - [Race Controller] This is Race Control. Bike X62, Isaac Elliott, is underway, having departed Finke checkpoint. - [Narrator] Isaac Elliott has one last leg to complete, to finish a race he started 10 years ago. (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] The three local guys up front, David Walsh, Daymon Stokie and Luke Hayes are all on their way. (engine roaring) Third bike on the track is number six, Luke Hayes. - [Commentator] Luke Hayes, from his point of view, there's so much resting on this. He's had I guess, with all due respect, a tumultuous 12 months. He hopefully is able to just push that all aside and then just get on with the job and keep racing the actual race. (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] At KTM and Yamaha's fuel stop for day two, the teams anxiously wait for their riders. - They don't deserve to have bad luck, but I'm sort of wishing it upon them. I think it's KTM's year to lose it. - [Jeff] We still want to be absolutely sure he's got enough fuel on there. So it's still key for him. Hopefully, he's got that good lead. (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic music) (engine roaring) (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic music) - [Man On Radio] Only fueling for Luke Hayes now then, Jeff? - What was that? - [Man On Radio] We are only fueling Luke Hayes now. Is that correct? - Why is that? Why did you say that? - [Man On Radio] Yeah it's Christian, so we are only fueling Luke Hayes, is that right now? - [Jeff On Radio] I didn't hear what the message was. Has David dropped out? - [Race Controller On Radio] We've had confirmation that bike three, David Walsh, has blown an engine just 10 kilometres out of Finke and he is out of the race. Repeat, out of the race, over. (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] All stations, all stations, this is Race Control. Daymon Stokie is now the leader of the race. - [Race Controller] Sounds like he is out of the race, in the helicopter, not injured. - [Man] Right. - [Race Controller] Lead bike through Mt. Squires is Daymon Stokie. With that broken hand, he just needs to hang on. (dramatic music) (helicopter buzzing) Apparently, the bike stopped 10 Ks out of Finke. Who's coming through? - [Man On Radio] Yamaha bike number four. - [Jeff] It was ours to lose, and we lost it. - [Ben] It's Dobby. - [Ben] Lift the cap, cap!. - [David] Be smart about it, get home. You've got plenty of time, alright? - [Daymon] Yeah. - [Man] Straighten it, straighten it, straighten it. Be smart. (talking drowned out by buzzing) (engine rumbling) - It's alright mate - [David] I was so bleak, couldn't keep fucking rolling. - [Race Controller] Number three, David Walsh, has DNF'd from the event with a mechanical issue, 10 kilometres from Finke. So that is absolute heartbreak. - [Man] Get organised for Luke. - Cheers. - No worries, brother. (dramatic music) - [Commentator] Wow. Daymon Stokie opening up a huge lead here. So he'll be really feeling it with that, the broken fingers, I think it is, across the knuckles. If Daymon Stokie stays on the bike and keeps it pointing forward he's going to be hard to beat at this stage, with about seven minutes up on Luke's. - [Narrator] Since David Walsh's bike broke down, Luke Hayes has now inherited second place. He's the last standing rider for KTM. - [Jeff] Going well, mate, you're into second. - [Man] Awesome. - About 30 seconds Stay safe, mate. (engine rumbling) - [Narrator] In Alice Springs the cars have already arrived. The crowds begin to gather in anticipation to see who will be crowned the next King of the Desert. because he is really opening up a gap now. - Yeah, absolutely, and it's looking like Ivan Long is really on a charge as well. It's closed in. (muffled talking) - [Tracy] I think out there with this stress factor, for moms it's a bit, and dads, it's about as bad as it gets. (laughing) Just the anticipation. - Yeah. You feel like you've got lots of stuff going on in the stomach that's for sure. - [Tracy] Yeah. (laughing) - Luke Hayes-- (muffled talking). Luke Hayes really needs to get a move on if he's going to hold off the charge of Ivan Long on that Husqvarna on the way home. (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] Third bike through Bundoona checkpoint is Ivan Long, in third place. That is two minutes and 18 seconds behind second place. (engine roaring) - [Man] Husqvarna, yeah, that's Longie. - [Race Controller] First three bikes are through Deep Well. Daymon Stokie followed by Luke Hayes, four minutes later, followed by Ivan Long. The distance between second and third place, it's just 15 seconds. (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic music) (clanging) (groaning) (dramatic music) - [Race Controller] All stations, all stations, a great story. Isaac Elliott has now passed through the last checkpoint at Deep Well and he's heading for home. - [Commentator] He was a very, very good motocross rider before his accident. So, here he comes. - [Race Controller] There's great anticipation here in Race Control. Who will that first bike be? (dramatic music) - [Commentator] I can see some dust on the horizon and I think that I can see a helicopter. - [Mary] Do you notice in the crowd, there's no noise? - [Commentator] Yes. - The noise of the crowd has gone down. They're all in anticipation of what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. Their eyes are focused, yes. (dramatic music) - What would it mean for you guys to bring this home today? - It would mean the world to him, the absolute world. (dramatic music) - [Man] About 13 Ks out, you sort of come over a gradual rise and then you can see town. You can see the towers, you can see the hills. (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic music) - [Commentator] I can see the bike now. So just trying to make out who it might be. Get ready to set this place alight. Ladies and gentlemen, your King of the Desert is in the house. (applauding) (cheering) (engine roaring) (cheering) - [Commentator] Daymon Stokie, the first time since 1986 we see a Yamaha take the crown here in Alice Springs, with a fantastic result. (applauding) (cheering) - My Dad's personal best was third outright, back in '98. And since then, it's been a dream of mine to match it. So, yeah, bucket list ticked right here. (applauding) - Luke Hayes. - [Narrator] They've endured the good, the bad and the ugly of the race. Whether you come first or last, it's all about making it there and back. (applauding) (cheering) - 90% are out there to get there and back. (cheering) - [Woman] Oh, Isaac, you're a legend. (dramatic music) - [Man] They see that chequered flag. They know that everything they dreamt of in the last year has gone right. - [Woman] Fence lines are just packed with people. It makes it even better to finish. - Come on, lips. (laughing) - When you finish that race, it's pretty damn cool. It's cool. - All that enthusiasm of whizzing by people and nearly clipping the beers out of their hands. - [Man] The glory in itself is just massive. - [Man] You get some that come home very untidy. But gee, they're happy to get to the finish line. (laughing) - You're my favourite. - Oh, I am? - I know that some of the cooler stories that I'll ever be able to tell will be ones that I've, you know, got from down there, down the track. - [Woman] On behalf of Tatts, I'd like to present the winner's cheque to our latest King of the Desert, local legend, Daymon Stokie. (applauding) (cheering) - Get on down to the Juicy Rump. I'll put five G's on the bar. (cheering) (dramatic music) (cheering) The amount of stress that I went through in the lead-up to it and for that to unfold like it did over the weekend, I'll never experience the same feelings of that again. (cheering) (chattering) (engine roaring) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) - [David] I mean it's got to stop one day. It gets harder and harder every year. Not getting any younger. So just can't think about it and, yeah, just knuckle down and push hard. Have a look at the backdrop here, God's country. It's like nowhere else. - [Narrator] The desert has stood for millions of years, an all-powerful force that looms over every rider. The race is an incomprehensible addiction. Once in your veins, it doesn't stop. - [Luke] It's escapism in its purest and most natural form. The moment you pull the helmet on and twist the throttle, it sort of all falls away. - [Isaac] When I'm on a bike, I'm free. (dramatic music) (engine roaring) (instrumental music)
