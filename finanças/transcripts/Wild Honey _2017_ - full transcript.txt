[soft music plays] [phone rings] - [Narrator] This is Roxie. - [Narrator] Hello. - [Roxie] Hi. What are you looking for today? - [Narrator] I don't know. The usual I guess. - Um, what's your name? - [Narrator] Richard. - [Roxie] Ooh, Richard. It's nice to meet you, Richard. Do you want me to tell you what I look like? - [Richard] Please. What do you look like? - [Roxie] I'm blonde. Five foot seven. With 34DD breasts. My measurements are 39, 24, 34. - [Richard] Whoa, you sound hot. - I'm very athletic. I wake up and do an hour of yoga every day. - [Richard] I bet you're limber. - I'm very supple and pliable. I'm basically a human pretzel. - [Richard] Excellent. - I feel like taking a bath. You want to take a bath with me, Richard? - [Richard] Yeah, that sounds good. Let's take a bath. - Mmm, okay. First I run the water in the tub really really hot. [faint beeping] And I see the steam coming up. - [Richard] Oh yeah. - And then I bring you in and strip you naked. - [Richard] Go on. That's good. - And then I take my lavender scented body soap and my loofah. I slide you down into the steamy bath. Fuck, fuck! And then I start jerking you off. Stop! Wait! Hold up! Oh baby, cum all over me, yeah! Wait, wait. Just stop. - Are you Gabriella Applebaum. - Okay, you know what? You're making a mistake. - Is this your Elantra? - You can't take my car. - I have a repossession order for delinquent payment. - Oh, baby, do me. No, you know what? This is my property. You can't just steal it, okay? You can't just. - Stand clear please. - Okay, listen, listen. I'm trying to tell you that you're making a mistake. - Are you prepared to make a payment? - Funds are a little tight right now, okay? - Sorry, ma'am. What are you doing? - I can't let you. I'm doing this for you karmically as well as for me. - Ma'am, this is my job. One way or another, I'm taking this Elantra. - You cannot take my baby. You wouldn't repossess an actual baby, would you? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. - Ma'am, look. - Fuck. - I don't sleep that much-- - You know what? I don't care!

What the fuck are you doing, you little shit? - It's not what it looks like. - You motherfucker! - [Gabriella Voiceover] I love threesomes.

But I got my first check yesterday. It was nothing. - It's always slow at first. - Well how long does it take? - Well, you make more with repeat customers. You gotta try to keep him talking. You're not gonna make as much if all your calls last like five or six minutes. - Well they don't usually last that long. You know I don't think we get a lot of guys that are into tantric phone sex. - Oh, hey, I've got one comin' in. I'll call you back. [moaning] Regina speaking. - [Caller] Hi there. - Hello and what are you looking for? - [Caller] I'm lookin' for you. [moaning] - And I'm lookin' for you too, baby. - You big hunk. You big bear of a man. [moaning] Oh baby, I'm so wet. I'm so drenched. Tie you up, I'm gonna spank you. [moaning] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. No, no, no, baby, I don't judge. It's no problem. Fuck. Hi Otis. Hi Otis. Where are you? You want to take a trip? You want to go to explore? You broke up with a guy because he had parquet flooring. Okay, you need to be more open minded. You know like me. - Open minded? - [Gabby] Yes. - Like you? - [Gabby] Yes. - Gaby, you're a doormat. - Oh, no I'm not. - It's like when you get a boyfriend. You get sucked up into his vortex. - Fine. - That guy Vince. He had you takin' care of his whole building like collecting rents and cleanin' his floors and-- - You know what, excuse me for wanting to make a man happy. - Well, that's fine. Just remember who you are. - Wait, check this out. Those guys at the pool table. How 'bout them? Come on. - I got it, asshat. - Dude, come on you guys! Come on! Come on! [vomiting] - [Instructor] Bring those arms up towards Heaven in three, two, one. - I read an article about these new antidepressants they're coming out with. I clipped it for you. - Are you saying that I need antidepressants? - I'm just letting you know that they don't have the bad side effects they used to. They won't make you gain all that weight. [doorbell rings] - Hi, are you Gabriella Applebaum? - Um, yeah. - You've been served. Have a nice day. - What does it say? - It's court papers. - Court papers? - Vince is suing me. - Suing you? - Last week he wants to get back together and now-- - [Mom] I told you he was no good right from the beginning. I could tell. - Mom, you never gave him a chance. He turned out to be a narcissistic asshole but it took him time to reveal that side. - Well luckily I have a very good attorney friend. - Who? - Sandy Gershowitz. - Oh, Mom, don't. You know you're always coming on to him. It's so obvious that you want to get in his pants. - Okay, Gabriella. Go ahead and tell me in your words why this young man is suing you. - Well because she didn't pay her rent. - Mom. Okay, my ex-boyfriend Vince was originally my landlord and then we started sleeping together. Then after I lost my job at the toll booth, they decided a machine with a big mouth you throw coins into was just as good as a nice friendly human face. He stopped charging me rent. - For how long did you carry on this arrangement? - A year and a half. And we broke up in March. And he wants me back. That's why he's doing this. He's just pissed because I moved on. - Did your ex-boyfriend sign anything like a contract indicating your rent was free once you became untangled? - Untangled? - While he was schtupping you! - No. [groans] [soft music] [phone beeps] This is Roxie. - [Caller] Oh, um, hi. - Who's this? - [Caller] This is Martin. - Well hi there. What can I do for you, Martin? What are you looking for? - [Martin] I don't really know. That's a good question. I found your number online. I just decided to give this a try. I'm pretty new to this. - No problem. That's okay. - [Martin] So, um, how do we do this? - Well. Right now I'm lying in my bed. With my fingers on my clit. - [Martin] Oh, really just, you just dive right in then. - You wanna dive right in me, Martin? - [Martin] Yeah, I mean, do we just go straight to the nitty gritty? - Now, well I can't help it. I'm dripping wet. - [Martin] Can we just take a little step back for a bit? Can we just start with a conversation? Sorry is that allowed? - A conversation? - [Martin] Yeah, like when two people meet in real life. Get to know you kind of thing. - Well, you know that we do charge per minute after the first 10, right? - [Martin] Yeah, I know. - Okay. Let's talk. - [Martin] I'm a screenwriter. I do rewrites and punch-ups on big Hollywood movies. Little bit of craftsman in the Hollywood hills. - Sounds glamorous. - [Martin] I mean sometimes but most of the time being a writer just means sitting and staring into space waiting for the ideas. - [Gabriella] Do you date a lot of big movie stars, Martin? - [Martin] [laughs] No. My wife was a character actress. You know, kind of gets cast as the best friend which in Hollywood means she's pretty but has dark hair. - And glasses. - [Martin] We've been divorced for years. You ever been divorced, Roxie? - Nope. - [Martin] Oh, it's fuckin' awesome. You should try it. Most of the stuff I do is comic book based or fantasy genre. We always produced on this perversely high budget. I bet your boyfriend's dragged you into a few of my movies. - I don't have a boyfriend. - [Martin] You don't? Really, they've got good Chinese in Chicago? - Chinese food? Sure. - [Martin] And as a habit whenever they bring you the fortune cookie I eat it, but I never read the fortune. Just throw it away. - Hi, I do that too. - Yeah? Do you really do that? - [Martin] Yeah. Always have. I've always been a realist. - Yeah, I never needed to know. I mean I assumed it was bad you know? Most of the time, I just prefer to live in the moment. - [Martin] Well that's a good philosophy. - [Gabriella] Are you in Balboa Park again? - [Martin] Actually I am. - [Gabriella] Do you write there every day? - [Martin] Yeah, pretty much. It's nice and quiet. There's this lake. Surrounded by cherry blossom trees. They bloom in the spring. It's fantastic. - You know, my sister lives in LA and I think she's in the Valley. - [Martin] Really? Where? She's anything like you I may have to start dating her. - Well, I'm not sure. We haven't spoken in a while. - [Martin] How long? - Um, I don't know. A couple years. ♪ Let me live ♪ Let me live my life ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ The best you gave ♪ Is the best you could find How 'bout him? That guy. - [Regina] No, no. - Why? - He looks like his name should be Kurt. - Oh, honey, you're too picky. [laughing] Regina, let me ask you something. Do you ever get a caller that you've found interesting? - Are you serious? - Well some of them are nice, right? - No, no, they are horny old men or weird shut-ins. And Gabby, you'd get fired in a hot second. - I know, I know, I know. - Look, they're freaking perverts girl. [slow paced music] [faint tapping] - [Roxie] Hello. - [Martin] Hey Roxie. - Hello Martin. - [Martin] Well you sound like you're in a good mood. - [Roxie] Well, let's just say I had a good day. - [Martin] Hey, did you know this is our two week anniversary? - Oh! - [Martin] It's the longest relationship I've ever had with a disembodied voice. - Same here. - [Martin] Hey, text me a picture of yourself. - Oh, I can't honey. - [Martin] Oh come on, you owe me. After all the money I've spent? - No, it's against the rules. - [Martin] Rules are made to be broken. - You're gonna get me fired. - [Martin] I mean you've got my number on at some screen I would assume. - Sure, but, nah, it's too risky. Besides, the voice I put on, I'm older than I sound. - [Martin] Come on Roxie, I wasn't born yesterday. - Well, what if you don't like what you see? - [Martin] I'm sure that won't happen. I'm gonna hang up, send me the picture. - No but... [slow paced music] [chiming] [dinging] - Goodnight pussycat, drive safe! Oh, you're still up. Stanley and I had a lovely dinner at Ditka's Steakhouse. - And I'm going on a vacation. - You are? - Yup. To Los Angeles. I'm going to visit Esther. - [Mother] Since when? - Since tonight. I just think that Esther and I need to put aside our differences and bury the hatchet. - Does Esther know? - Mom, I'm not gonna dignify that answer. - Image isn't really about clothes. Image is about the way you see yourself. You are unconsciously, non-verbally telling people how to see you. So, are you a recluse? Are you a slob? Or, are you confident, happy, and successful? It is up to you. Let me tell you a story. One of my earlier clients back in Chicago was cripplingly shy. I created an entire new image for him based on three points. Work outfits, happy hour looks, weekend style. He emailed me exactly one year later to tell me that he was wearing the gingham shirt I bought to propose to his new girlfriend. And do you know what she said? [ringing] God damn it, I'm sorry. Greta, will you finish? She'll finish all the details for you. Hello. - [Gabby] Hey dude. - Gabby, hi. Is Mom okay? - [Gabby] Oh she's fine. I just wanted to reach out. Say shalom. - How nice. Listen, I'm actually working right now. Is it okay if I call you in a couple days? - [Gabby] I'm coming to visit. - You're what? [slow paced music] - [Narrator] Please leave a message after the tone. - Hi Martin, I hope this is Martin. Your message had that robotic lady voice on it. Anyway, this is, this is Roxie. I hope you don't mind my calling you privately. Outside of work I mean. I've decided to live dangerously. So call me whenever you get a chance, thanks. I have a surprise for you. It's Roxie again, bye. [upbeat music] - [Narrator] You have no messages. - You're what? - Come on, listen, please listen. - What the hell are you doing in LA? - If you get a caller named Martin, have him call me okay. He's got my number. - You went all the way to LA for some freak who sits at home jerking off over the phone? - [Gabby] He's nice. - You're gonna get fired! Shit canned! - Please Regina, come on. Just don't tell him I'm here, all right. I only have the weekend. Just tell him to call me all right? - Fine. - Oh you're a goddess. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you, bye. - Are you Gabby Applebaum? - Yeah. - Hi I'm Greta, I'm Esther's personal assistant. It's nice to meet you. - Oh, hi. - [Greta] Can I take your bag? - Oh no, I got it, I got it. - Come with me. She's sorry she couldn't make it herself. - [Gabby] Oh, okay, all right. [upbeat music] - Wow, look at that, you're here. - I told you. - Well, come on in. - Hi. - If you could just excuse us for one second. Gabby. Greta, can you confirm my 11 o'clock appointment and here is the shopping list for the new client. I need you to pick up my dry cleaning and do it before you make the returns. - [Greta] Okay, got it. - [Esther] Got it? All right thanks Greta. Sorry about that. - It's a nice joint. - Well it needs work. We're gonna push out the dining room, but we like it. Just put your bag over in the corner there. Not on the rug. Is it cold back home? - Cold as a witch's tit in a brass bra in the middle of Lake Michigan. - Well that's lovely. - Oh, I am ready for sunshine. - You hate the sun. You always said it gave you a rash. - Oh that's so I could get out of softball. - Well you shouldn't have signed up if you didn't wanna commit. - I was nine. They shouldn't of held practice when I was watching Scooby-Doo. Oh I can help? - No, sit, sit, sit. - This lotion that I bought at the airport smells like feet. - How long are you in town? - Two days, til Monday. - Well sorry, it's so crazy. Maybe if you'd let me known ahead of time, planned in advance-- - Don't worry. - You know, since Burt got laid off my work load has double, and with the kids I barely have time to breathe. - I can keep myself busy. - I'm surprised you even have money for a trip like this. Mom said you're having trouble finding work. - No, no, no, I've got a new job. - Really? - Yeah. - Mazel tov. - Thank you. You know, the hours are good. I can work out of my bedroom. I don't even have to change out of my pajamas. - You didn't answer an ad on the telephone pole did you? - No. - Because those are a scam, you know that right? - Yeah. I'm a phone sex operator. I work for a phone sex line. - You're stimulating orgasms from men on the phone for money? - Yeah, but I get to use this really cool voice. Hey big boy. - And you don't have any sort of ethical problem with that? - I'm helping people. And you can make a lot of good money if you build up a good client base. - How are you helping people? - Everybody needs somebody to love. - Does Mom know that you are running a phone sex line out of her house? - Hey, I buy mom's groceries, I pick up her prescriptions, I take her to Zumba class, I'm basically her nurse chauffer. - Well that's what you get living at your mother's house when you're 50. - 49. - Well at least you found a skill that you could monetize. - Okay, what's the orange in the potato? - It's a sweet potato. - Oh yeah. Yeah that's good. - All right guys, enough with the phones. Please? Eye contact. That's what people do when they interact. Burt. - Sorry. - So, why don't I push my meeting tomorrow morning and you and I go have brunch somewhere nice? - I'd like that. - [Narrator] You have no messages. [slow paced music] - Oh hi, you ready for brunch? - Where's Esther. - She's sorry, she couldn't move her 11 o'clock, but she asked me to take you. - So why do you have two phones? - Oh, this is my work phone. - So basically Esther needs a direct line to you at all times? What's it like working for her? - She's nice. - Really? It's okay. She's my sister, I've known her since I was two-years-old. You can be honest. - She's nice. - Has Esther told you that we've barely spoken in years? - No, I didn't know that. - Yeah I mean, we don't hate each other or anything. But you know, let's just say we are different. And she's very concerned about what other people think. - And you're not? - Well it's not like I can do anything about it. - You are different. Hey, are there any particular sites you wanna see while you're here? The Walk of Fame or maybe the Hollywood sign? - Yeah, I'd like to go to a park. - We can go to Griffith Park. We can go up to the Griffith Observatory. - I'd like to go to Balboa Park in Van Nuys. - You wanna go to Van Nuys? [slow paced music] [duck quacking] This is nice. I never even knew this was here. I gotta get out more. Never even go to the beach. I've lived here 11 years and I've been swimming twice. - Can I tell you a secret? - [Greta] What kind of secret? - A man. - Yes. - Well he lives in LA. I'm a phone sex operator, he's my best customer and I was hoping to meet him. - Wow, they still have phone sex lines? - Oh yeah, it's actually a thriving industry. I mean they have webcams and stuff too, but there's still a lot of guys out there that like to hear a sexy voice talking about their cock. - Now I know. - I just couldn't bring myself to tell Esther that I came all this way just to meet a man I've never met. Just sounds kinds stupid now that I say it out loud. - No, I think it's brave. - You do? - Yeah. Can I tell you a secret? - Sure, anything honey. - I'm pregnant. - Okay. - I mean I haven't told Esther yet. - Well I don't think you need to at this point. - She won't be happy. My job's like 24 hours a day. This will definitely qualify as a distraction. - How could she not know you're pregnant? - [Greta] Have you ever worked for someone who doesn't really see you? - Yeah, but why don't you just tell her? - No, she makes me a little anxious. Since I got pregnant my mouth overproduces saliva, so when I get nervous it triggers my gag reflex. - You know what, I'm just gonna level with you right now. You've gotta tell her. [loud gagging] Oh, wow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, just breathe. [loud gagging] There you go. Okay, all right. Okay. - Okay. - Boy or girl? - Boy. - Oh good, good, no drama. You just have to make sure that he doesn't eat the electrical socket or climb on the TV set. And tell him that he can't be a prick to women when he grows up. - I'm supposed to feel him kicking by now, but I'm almost at five months and I haven't felt anything. - Well maybe you have and you just don't know it? [buzzing] - Hello Esther. I can stop by the Topanga Mall. Yeah, just text me the sizes. I have to work. - No problem. Don't worry about me. I'll just stick around here and explore. - Hey give me your phone. I'll put my number in, you can text me when you need me. - Oh yeah. And just remember, Greta, you mustn't let the fear of being shit-canned get in the way of what you really want. - Yeah, I spend 24 hours a day focused on somebody else's life. I don't even know what I really want. [slow paced music] [ringing] - Hello. - I miss you. - [Gabby] Really? Then why'd you sue me? - I don't have to. I can make that all just float away. - We're not getting back together Vince. And I don't owe you a years back rent. - Come on Gabby, don't you just wanna forget all this shit and drive out to Michigan and rent a pontoon boat and get wasted? - No, I don't. In fact, I can't. You know why? 'Cause I'm in LA right now. - Los Angeles? Bullshit. - Here, listen. It's the ocean somewhere. - [Vince] What the hell are you doing there? - As a matter of fact, I'm here to see a guy. - What guy? Where'd you meet this guy? - [Gabby] On the phone, through my-- You know what, never mind! - Oh, so you meet some guy over the phone and you think he's in love with you? - That's not what happened. - Yeah funny, he's trying to steal your travelers checks or something. - He's a successful screenwriter actually. A real man. Not some Ritalin addicted man-child. - ADHD is not a joke, bitch! - Fucker! ♪ Packing me soft like your ♪ Punching pillow ♪ Sharp as a guillotine ♪ As wicked as the gallows ♪ If you're looking for sedative ♪ ♪ Well, I can be mellow ♪ But truth they don't [ringing] ♪ I'm pretty yellow Hello? - [Martin] Hi Roxie. - Hi Martin. - [Martin] So I guess you couldn't wait for my next call I see. - No, I guess I couldn't. - [Martin] Well what is this big surprise you speak of? - Well, guess what? Okay. [slow perky music] Hi. - You must be Roxie. I'm Martin. - I'm Gabby actually. - Of course. I'm still Martin. Hey. So why aren't you in Chicago? - [Gabby] Oh, I'm visiting my sister. You know, just for the weekend. - [Martin] The same sister you haven't talked to in two years? - That's the one. - [Martin] Well good, I'm glad you're here. It's nice to actually meet you in person. - And after that, Regina, my best friend, she hooked me up with this gig. - Do you like it? - Well, it's pretty boring. Unless you call. - Thanks. My job's pretty boring too to tell you the truth. - All my jobs have been boring. [slow perky music] So, you got any tattoos? - No, no I almost got one. Was gonna get one when I turned 40. Honestly couldn't figure out anything I could commit to. - If you had a gun to your head and you had to get a tattoo, what would it be? - I would get tattooed on my body a tiny appendix somewhere above wherever my appendix is so if I ever get severe stomach pains, I'll know if I'm having appendicitis. - [Gabby] Mine would be Fred Flintstone. - Okay, Stones, classic. - I mean he's the ideal man. His rough exterior, heart of gold, bark is bigger than his bite. And he's funny, which is important. And I obviously am a total Wilma. - [Martin] Obviously. - Yeah. [giggling] Yeah, I think it just goes different generations-- - To your left! - Oh god! - Jesus! - [Martin] It's a fucking sidewalk you dick! - Jesus! - You okay? - [Gabby] I'm fine. Ouch, god. - Oh shit, what happened? ♪ Hey ma ♪ I'm a star ♪ I got the shit they die for ♪ Nothing less but a whole lot more ♪ Here we are. - Oh this is nice. Is that an orange tree? - Yeah. I wasn't exactly expecting company, so, can you wait here a second? - Yeah, sure, I'm fine. - Pick the dirty underwear up off the floor. Thanks. All right, all clear. - Oh nice. - Great, have a seat. - Thank you. How long have you lived here? - [Martin] About three years now. - Nice place. - Thanks, I like it. Here, put your foot up. - Oh okay. - There, how's that? - That's cold. - Yeah, it's because they are frozen peas. Now, I am not a doctor but I've seen them on TV. What's the first part of the pledge? First do no harm. I shall endeavor as such. I don't think we have to cut it off. [laughing] This stuff is supposed to keep the swelling down. So, let's see now. Is that okay? Does that hurt? - I'll be fine. My body's a workhorse. I never get sick. Never did as a kid either. - I was always sick with some virus or other. Spent most of my senior year in bed like some Victorian poet with consumption. - That must've been very disappointing. - I got mono, the kissing disease. Which I sadly got from a water fountain. What the hell's that? [light jazz music] My parents never stopped fighting. It was so obvious they hated each other. They just never bothered to get a divorce. Which is one stick of theirs that I didn't repeat. It's classic I just escaped into science-fiction, and fantasy, and Tolkien, Ray Bradbury. Dungeons and Dragons. - You were one of those kids huh? - Fuck you. [laughing] I'm so sorry if I preferred fantasy to my shit reality. But that's what makes me such an amazing phone sex client right? - Cheers to that. - How's your tea? - It's really good. - That's fresh honey. From my apiary. - I'm sorry, what? [light music] - There they are. Urban beekeeping is illegal in most cities. This is my small act of rebellion. - Where'd you get a beehive? - Online. You can get anything online. Did you know we're in the midst of a honeybee crisis? - No. - Yeah. Pesticides, fungicides killing them all off. Humanity shooting itself in the head. The smoke mellows them out. There we go. Look at that huh. How cool is that? - [Gabby] Yeah. - Now look. That's the queen. - [Gabby] Oh my gosh, that looks like too much pressure. I don't know if I could handle that. - I don't know. There's something to be said for knowing your purpose in life. What one of these little guys does down to the lowest worker bee. That is very fresh bees wax. I still can't get over the fact that you're here. I'm really glad you called though. - You are? - Of course I am. This was great. - I thought so too. - The rest of my day's a cluster fuck though. I've got this thing I gotta be at in like 20 minutes and then I got this show I've gotta go to tonight which I am really - No. - not looking forward to. - I understand. - [Martin] If I had known it... Well, I have a parting gift for you. Consolation prize. A little something to remember our day by. It's my very first batch. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Nothing better than homegrown honey. Once you take the stingers out of your face. - Oh, stingers are no fun. - They're not, however, wait til you taste that honey. - Listen, seeing how this is, we have only today. I know this is ridiculously last minute, but I was wondering if I could tag along. If you don't mind. - No I don't. No I don't mind. You sure? - Yeah, I'm easy. Not that easy but. - Okay, come on. - Great. [upbeat music] - Scene 43, exterior barren planet, day. A vast landscape of red rock dotted with impact craters interrupted only by a single sleek monolith jutting out like a knife at a 45 degree angle. Interior starship, main corridor, day. The guards eyes dart nervously between Barren and Cobb. Barren remains composed despite the phaser pressed to his temple. - How did you escape the holding dock? - We were freed. - By whom? - Your commanding officer. - The Tycon is in danger. - I don't believe you. - If you lower your weapon, I can prove it. - That is the end of the act. [applauding] - Okay, so does anybody have any feedback? - Well I liked it. - Oh the notes. It was nothing. You should of been here last week. Somebody brought in a pilot script, it was a fucking bloodbath. - Then why do you go? - That's a good question. I don't know, they asked me to join. I swear to god, some of these guys just like hearing their own voice. I really think a couple of them are jealous. - Probably right. - This is the work though. You lay your soul bare naked in front of the world so the cultures can rip out your intestines. What the fuck are they talking about too much backstory and emotionally stunted? I gotta stop going to these guys. They're just tearing me down. - Oh come on.. I mean what can we do to get you out of this funk? - This one is called Space Mountain. It has a cool alpine taste like fresh pine needles bursting into sort of a psychedelic intellectually creative hyperspace. It's very stimulating. - All right, yeah, that sounds promising. - This one is called the Midnight Train To Georgia. It will take you to a faraway place. It's a long-lasting full body buzz. - Right. - And this one is called Cosmonaut Laika. Named after the Soviet space dog. The first animal to ever orbit the earth. Mind expanding. - You know, I think what I'm looking for is something that will help me sort of focus and enhance my creative energy and open the doors of perception and all that. But still put me in this deep philosophical state. You know what I'm talking about? - Yeah, no, I think we have that. - What about this? - Whoa. Proceed with caution. That strain is potent. It's called the Shit Snoop Dog Smokes. - Why? - Because it's the shit Snoop Dog smokes. - Martin we have to get this. So what kind of show is this? - God only knows. [slow light music] - [Narrator] Great show. - Oh thank you so much for coming. Glad you enjoyed it. - Hi. - There she is. - You came! - [Martin] Of course I came, what are you talking about? - Is Mom here? - I didn't see her. - She never comes to any of my shows. - You know your mom. Oh, I'm very sorry. Francesca this is my friend Gabby. Gabby this is Francesca my daughter. - Hi, nice to meet you. - You brought a woman. At least one of you is able to understand the meaning of my piece. - It was good piece. Really good. - And, what did you think? - It's really, it was really great. It's bold. I sometimes think your work can be a little emotionally stunted. - I'm standing out there naked! - You don't need to remind me. - Dad, you're out of-- - You know what, we'll talk about Friday, the bars okay. - Oh I can't make it. - What? - I'm sorry, it's really busy right now. - That's the third time in a row, Frannie. - You know, I'm gonna visit the lady's room? - Oh, backstage to the left. Gabby huh? - That's me. - So is this like a date? - Oh I don't... I guess so. - I have one question for you. Have you ever grown anything from seed with your bare hands in the dirt? - Well I grew sea monkeys from a packet in the mail when I was a kid. - Be nice to him okay. - Yeah. - Hey! Come here. - Yeah. - Your tags sticking out. - Oh. Thank you. This is fancy. - Well you came all this way. I wanted to take you some place nice. I heard great things about this place. - Why are there no prices? - Oh that's just how they do it. - Have we come to a decision? - You start. - What is in the Birds Nest Salad? - Two eggs of asparagus, an oyster mushroom, and a nest of millet, parsnip, and maple syrup. It's one of the signature dishes. - I'll have that. - [Waitress] And for you? - I'll have the PB and J. - Excellent choice, that's very popular. - I'll bet. - Are you interested in any wine tonight? - [Martin] Sure. - Wonderful, I'll send over the sommelier. - [Martin] Thank you. - You are very welcome. - So thanks for coming to that. - Oh yeah. We don't get that stuff in Chicago. - Do you have kids? - No, no way. All I learned from my upbringing was how to screw them up. - Everybody screws them up. You just try to not make the same mistakes your parents did. I like to make my own mistakes. - Are you and your daughter close? - Yeah, I mean, I'm sure she thinks I wasn't around enough. So, trying to make up for that. - Well you couldn't of screwed her up that much. She seems to be a very smart, strong, beautiful young woman. - Yeah she is, thank you. She's really talented too, I just, I just think she's wasting her time. Nobody cares about theater, not in LA. - I mean at least she's passionate about things. I never had any drive like that. - Well, drives fine but she just needs to be more practical about her financial future. It's a hard town. It's not easy to be successful. - Well, at least she has a dad who can show her how. - Look at that. - [Gabby] I don't understand, is that the chef? - Mm hmm, Tyler Rogsen. 11-year-old wonder kid. - He's 11? - New Yorker just did an amazing piece on him. He just staged one of the top restaurants in Manhattan. - That's crazy. - I know right? Well. - [Waitress] Here you are. - [Martin] Thank you. - [Waitress] You're very welcome. - [Martin] Oh, this looks great. - What is this? - It's a deconstructed peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You dip the flash-fried grapes in the brioche powder and you breathe in the aroma of the peanut water. - Oh. Thank you. - [Waitress] You're very welcome, enjoy. - [Martin] Bon appetit. - Doesn't this seem a little ridiculous to you? - I don't know. When I was young I could never afford a place like this. I perfected the art of making one crunch wrap burrito last through breakfast lunch and dinner, so. Thinking now that I can, I like to go out to a nice restaurant every now and then. Have a good meal. - Cooked by an 11-year-old. - Who's one of the hottest chef's in LA. - He's 11. Why do people pretend that he's such a genius. I'm sorry, but this food is awful. Fuck me. - You were saying? [slow paced music] Now we're cooking with gas. - Oh good. I was always different. Mom wanted me to fit in so she put me on my first fad diet when I was like eight. Mom would say something mean about my weight, I would get upset, my dad would take me out for ice cream. It was a vicious cycle. And Esther was just embarrassed by me. How about you? You and your brother get along? - Sort of. We had a band together in high school. Puke Bone. [laughing] It's named after a chicken bone my dog threw up. It was very high brow stuff. Mostly just esoteric tributes to the short stories of Philip K Dick. - What? - The sci-fi writer. - Oh yeah? - For some reason, our music just didn't resonate with our fellow high school students. So he quit and joined an Aerosmith cover band. - Oh. - They played at my senior prom, which naturally I did not attend. My little brother got laid at my senior prom and I didn't. - Oh god. - He's out here now too. - Really? - He must look up to me 'cause he keeps following my footsteps. And he always ends up doing better than me. - Hot tub. Do you believe in aliens? - Absolutely. - Peaceful ones? - Well, we do have a lot of natural resources to plunder. I'd like to think they're a lot like us. - I hope so. [slow paced music] - [Martin] Fuck. - What? - [Martin] Nothing. - [Gabby] No, what's wrong? - It's nothing, I just... Snoop Dog's making me a little paranoid that's all. - Not me. I am on a cloud. - [Martin] I'm so afraid you're gonna find out the truth. - What do you mean? - I'm a complete fraud. It's all an illusion. In reality I'm completely worthless. - No. - No, you don't know. You don't know. [light music] - Okay. Hey Esther I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. - [Esther] Greta, I don't know how there are five sets of contracts that haven't been signed. They need to be done by today. - Gabby and I spoke and she said that I should talk to you. - I'm so sorry that I stuck you with Gabby. And whatever she said, take it with a grain of salt, please. - No Esther. Esther! - What? - I'm-- [gagging] - Oh god. Oh Greta, do you want a glass of water? Here, hang on. I'll get you a glass of water. [gagging] Here, here, here. - I quit. - No Greta. Greta, Greta. [coughing] [upbeat music] - [Narrator] You had your cellphone in your possession the whole time? - [Martin] Yes! - [Narrator] Did you lend it to anyone? - [Martin] What is this about? - [Narrator] Did you give your cellphone to like a friend? - [Martin] No, what are you talking about? - [Narrator] $950. - There's no way it was that much! - I got an alert on my phone. Otherwise, I wouldn't have even known. - Dude I'm sorry, I made a couple of phone calls all right. - You are living in my house, I'm paying for your cellphone bill, and you have to spend $950 to jack off! - [Martin] It is not about that! - Who's that? - Fuck. Don't worry about her. Gabby, I can explain. Just give me a minute. Would you listen to me! - Sorry dude, you gotta go. I've been trying to get you back up on your feet. I've been trying. But you just keep fucking up. Where are our pictures? The pictures are missing. - In the drawer, they're fine. - You took down our pictures? - I was gonna put them back. You weren't supposed to be here for another week! - Our shoot got moved up, I had to come back. Why am I explaining myself to you? - Martin. - [Martin And Brother] What! - Oh fuck! Why do you always have to fuck up everything that is important to me? Just like when you left Puke Bone! - That was in the 10th grade! - [Martin] Oh I know exactly when it was. - Martin, there is a beehive in the backyard! - Are you serious? - Yeah. - How did that get there? - I put it there. - What the hell is wrong with you! - Are you familiar with the little term called colony collapse disorder! - Quiver is allergic to bees! - Gabby. Gabby. Would you wait? - [Gabby] No. - Would you just please - No. - [Martin] let me explain. Let me talk to you for a minute. Give me one minute. - Fuck. Oh my god, Regina was right. What was I thinking getting mixed up with a caller? You know, this whole trip was so stupid. - You've met me at a very difficult juncture. - It was all lies. You're like my grandma's tin of Royal Dansk Butter Cookies. Looks delicious, but when you open it it's a sewing kit. - You've gotta understand. I didn't intend for any of this to happen. - I understand that. But you lied to me. Are you even a writer? - Of course I'm a writer. I'm just not a very good one. It's my brother's house. He writes for TV, takes his family to Europe. I work at a Bed Bath and Beyond. - Look, I have screwed up a lot. I just thought that my life was on a new track. Well I guess, I guess I was wrong. - Gabby. Gabby would you... [siren blaring] - [Esther] Hello. - Hey lady. - Gabby, where the hell have you been? - No I know, I know, I'm so sorry. I lost track of time and my phone was turned off. I should've called. - Greta told me that she dropped you off at some park in Van Nuys? - I was meeting someone. - [Esther] Who? - A guy. - [Esther] Who? - A caller. - [Esther] Someone from your phone sex job? - Well he seemed nice. - I see what this is. You're only here so that you can sleep with some dude. - What do you care? You dumped me with your personal assistant. - I had meetings. And you told her to quit? - What? - I am running around here like a madwoman thanks to you. - She left? I never said that. I told her that she should get over her hears and tell you that she was pregnant. - Well of course she is pregnant. She's as big as a fucking house! - Well I was trying to encourage her. Frankly, she's terrified of you. - You are so irresponsible. You act like a child. - Right, and you're still the prom queen who can do no wrong. - [Esther] It's homecoming. - Yeah, exactly. You're the perfect little china doll and I'm the big stupid doll who pees herself. And don't worry, Mom reminds me of that every day. - I should of known you weren't coming out here to see me. We haven't spoken in years. - And why haven't we huh? Why are you so ashamed of me? - Sooner or later, you are gonna have to own who you are. [solemn music] [ringing] - What is it Vince? - [Vince] I'm gonna win you back Gabby. - Please stop calling me. - [Vince] I'm here. - What? Where? [quirky music] - Go Bears. - Go Bears. - Welcome to my humble commode. - Huh. What's that? - Well there's refreshments. All for you gorgeous. A little token of me affectation. [upbeat music] I say no to peer pressure! - Just say no. - I don't use this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but here's the deal man. - Not even a little bit tasty! So he was like "Connie, you're amazing "at the motorcycle." This is the gold stuff, this is really real Gab. [laughing] Gabby. Nothing but the best. - But why, why would you do that? - No, look at me. - Okay. [imitates barking] Wait, you did it before me. I can't. - You almost puked. [loud burping] There it is! - No, no, no man. - Yeah. [alarm ringing] - Yeah, I haven't decided if I'm gonna take you back. - Shut up. Yes you have. - I can't believe you came all the way out here for me. - Well I had frequent flyer miles from my trip to Amsterdam. They were about to expire so. You are so stupid to think you can find someone better than me. - So stupid. Yeah. - So I'm driving around LA today, where's the city? There's like gas station, strip mall, gas station. It's like the whole city is one big Niles. - Did you just take a shower? - No, I just washed my hair. Take it. - No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. - Don't be stuck up, take it! - Okay, fuck. [whistling] Wait. Are you proposing? - That's my dead grandmothers ring. It was hers right. And I told my parents I didn't want it. And then my sister married that preacher asshole, and then it bounced back to me and I was like, "I'll never use this thing." Well, well you know people change. - No, I gotta think. - Think? - Yeah, just let me sober up a little bit okay? - Oh. Yeah yeah yeah. It's cool, that's cool. I mean hell, I've been single 42 years. Just one nonstop kegger. I am cool yo. - You're very sweet Vince. - Gabby. When my uncle died and he left me the building, I thought my ship had come in. I'm just gonna sit back and I'm gonna rake in the moola. Running an apartment complex is hard. I was gonna sell the place even though everybody says, "It's not a good time to sell." Then along came you. And I thought, "I can handle this." - It's because I collected all the rent. I did all the paperwork. I took all the calls at three am about clogged pipes. - Yeah, that's love baby. - You don't need a wife, you need a super. - I need us! I want us! I want what we had! - Vince, we don't, we don't connect. - What does that even mean? - Well you never asked what I think. You never wanted to know what my inner thoughts were. - You never wanna know mine either. - True. Oh Vince-- - You know what, you disappoint me. - What are you doing, coke again? - I'm out of Ritalin's is that okay with you? I'm not gonna let you go Gabby. The heart wants what it wants. And I am not gonna deny my heart. - Excuse me. Hi. Greta, it's Gabby. I'm sorry to bother you right now. I'm in kind of a pickle. My ex-boyfriend is here. I'm at the, at the Victory Palms motel. I think it's off Victory and I'm in room 125. I just need you to come rescue me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid, I barely know you. You're my sisters assistant and you're pregnant. Yeah I shouldn't of bothered you. I made my bed, I have to lie in it right? Forget I called. I'll be okay. Thanks, bye. ♪ This shit got no way ♪ This shit doesn't ♪ K K K K K ♪ I've been waiting ♪ Take a friend they can hate ♪ Cage cage cage cage ♪ They say I'm crazy baby ♪ They can't tame me ♪ I'm the one that made me [loud knocking] - You must be Vince. - [Vince] Who are you? - I'm Esther, I'm Gabby's sister. We haven't met, but I know who you are. - Oh. I heard you have a 10 foot pole up your cunt. - Really? Well I heard you're a parasitic man baby who likes ugly shirts. - I guess we know each other. - Yeah we do. - [Gabby] Esther what are you doing here? - Come on Gabby, let's go. - Oh, I don't think so. See, she and I are engaged, we are family. - I didn't say yes yet Vince. - You will. - No I won't necessarily. - Put on the ring, bitch. - Okay, you two can continue this lively discussion some other time because Gabby is coming with me. - I don't think so! [screaming] - Oh my god! - Oh I didn't mean to spray it! I'm so sorry! I was brandishing it! - Oh god it's like 1,000 razors! - Vince, someone's gonna call the cops! - They should! She attacked me! - I was brandishing. - This is how you treat your brother-in-law? - Don't rub your eyes. - [Vince] But that's where it hurts! - [Gabby] You're spreading it around. - Splash cold water into the infected area. - [Vince] You are not part of the solution! - Put your hand away. I'm sorry Vince. I just think that we're not meant for each other. - Gabby, Gabby, don't you think that-- - Don't talk. Let's get a drink. - It's late. My kids hate me. - Of course they do. - Especially Mika, I'm always on him about that beard. - That's what kids are into these days. - It's like a big food catcher around his mouth. And Burt too. He just retreats into his little mental wounds, inner 7th grade child. - You have a lot on your shoulders huh? - You know why he lost his job? - Why? - He was cheating the company. - Really? No shit. - He's lucky he's not in jail right now. - Wow. - You know what the problem is? I have become Mom. [laughing] - Please. Don't be so hard on yourself. - I have, you know I have. Did you know that I have my ringer on my phone set to the Supremes so that when she calls I know it's her. And now I can't stand the fucking Supremes. - Wait, wait, wait, you dread talking to Mom as much as I do? - Yeah, of course I do. Of course I do. And you know with you, you were a loose cannon. So she just threw her hands up. But with me, every detail of my life was scrutinized. It was this parade of constant Jewish mom commentary. You know how I handle her now when she calls? - [Gabby] Huh? - I pretend like I'm talking to an insane person at a mental institution. And it works. Seriously. - I'm gonna have to try that. - You float through life don't you? You don't give a shit about anything. Drifting on a cloud, screwing up wherever you go. I'm a career woman, I'm a wife, I'm a mother. I did everything by the book. So why is my life such a shit storm? - I don't know. People are weird. Why did Dad send a picture of his schlong to the neighbors wife? - In the mail. - Yes, through the mail. Oh man, what was he thinking you know? If Dad were alive today-- - Oh sexting? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dad would be like, "Oh the world has "caught up with me." - He was ahead of his time. [laughing] So funny. So not funny. I'm sorry I quit talking to you. Come on, let's get out of here. This is my favorite taco truck. Don't tell Burt and the kids because they think I hate tacos. [laughing] Hi. Let's see. [speaking foreign language] Three tacos. We'll take three chicken tacos. - Okay. That's gonna be cash or credit? [speaking foreign language] - Cash. [slow paced music] You remember when you came home with half your head shaved? - Yeah. - Mom like lost her bananas. - Well that was a tactic to distract her from the nose ring. I thought I could get her to accept it if I grew my hair back out. No, that nose ring looked stupid anyway. - But you didn't care. And I envied that about you. - You did not envy me. I was an embarrassment. - You were my big sister, I worshiped you. How's your taco? - It's good. - Good god it is freezing up here. - Oh you lost your Chicago skin girlfriend! - You always had a thick skin. [slow paced music] [loud tapping] - [Mother] Did you pick up my prescription at Osco? - Yes. - [Mother] Did you forget the dish soap? - No, I got it. - [Mother] Anti-bacterial? - Yes. - Oh good, maybe you'll use it too. You know you left your cereal bowl in the sink this morning. And that's an open invitation for roaches to come in and make a home here. - I'm sorry, Mother. I'll be sure to make an effort about cleaning the dishes. - Well good. You know, it's just like in high school. You'd go out gallivanting with your friends and I'd be left to clean up your room to prevent a rat infestation. - You're right. Thanks for keeping the rats away, Mom. - You're welcome. [loud moaning] - Mmm. Thanks Roger. - [Roger] Thank you darling. - That was really nice. Tomorrow? - [Roger] Six o'clock. - See ya then. Mmm. This is Kendall. - [Martin] Hi Kendall. - Who is this? - [Martin] It's Martin. You sound very beautiful, Kendall. - Well beauty is only skin deep you know. - [Martin] Yeah I guess so. - Inner beauty and truth is what really matters. - [Martin] That's true. - Do you have inner beauty, Martin? - [Martin] I don't know. I'd like to think so. - Because that's important. - [Martin] Isn't this sort of unusual for one of these phone calls? - I don't know, you sound like you call these lines a lot, you tell me. - [Martin] Yeah you're right. Actually, I used to call this line almost every day. Used to talk to a girl named Roxie. Do you know her? - Roxie's dead. - Well shit. That's awful, how did it happen? - She died in a balloon accident. - Well that is shockingly random. It's too bad too because we used to have some really great talks. Some things I was hoping I could say to her. To Roxie. - What would you say to her? I mean if she were still alive. - I just really miss her. And I'm sorry, I shouldn't of lied. I have no idea why I did it. I think it just spiraled out of control and... Well, that's bullshit too. I do know. I was ashamed. - So you lied to impress her? - It's not that simple. I didn't wanna talk about what was real. I know, I was just afraid if she knew the truth, I'm a mess. I'm a fucking mess, that's the truth. I don't have a big house or a big career. The person that she met, that guy, that was me. I can't fake that. - But your name isn't even Martin. - Her name wasn't Roxie. Did you know that? - I didn't know her very well. I thought she was extremely naive and stupid. - She wasn't stupid. She wasn't stupid or naive, she was an honest person in a dishonest world. I wish there were more people like her. - Well, Roxie's dead in a balloon accident so you can't talk to her, I'm sorry. - It's okay. I understand. - But, if you want, you can talk to me. - I can? - But if you talk to me you have to be completely honest. No lies. - I promise. - Okay then, let's start over.
