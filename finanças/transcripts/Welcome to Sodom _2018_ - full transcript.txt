Sometime ago, Earth was a paradise for all people. But they didn't respect the land. They did not care about the animals, and not for each other. Then, one day, the gods sent down one of their servants to look after the land and to see how the people would live. Itself invisible, the creature's eyes were everywhere, and saw into every hidden corner. As the gods found out what the people had done, they were very angry. As a punishment, they took everything from them. Only left them with their hope. They lighted a fire, so big and fierce, and it should burn forever. Under the smoke and the ashes, the paradise vanished. The people are damned to watch over the fire and feed it, and in its flames, all our dreams should burn every day. Again and again. ♪ Immortal God ♪ ♪ Invisible God ♪ ♪ Immortal God ♪ ♪ I'll praise ya, ah-how ♪ ♪ Immortal, immortal God ♪ ♪ Invisible God ♪ ♪ Immortal God ♪ ♪ I'll praise ya, ah-how ♪ I'm telling you, Sodom and Gomorrah, they are wicked! Wicked, wicked in such a way that they are killing people! So Jehovah, Allah, Jehovah, Emmanuel say, "oh, my name is God of mankind. "I create you and you are punishing them like a god." Jonah says, "I am God." Your god must destroy them, you must face the doom. You must face the destruction. Because, Sodom and Gomorrah, they are too wicked! The reason why the chameleon walks slowly is, when God created the Earth, the Earth was not strong, not hard. When he, the chameleon, wanted to walk, the Earth would break. He needs time to look around and see everything. So that is why the chameleon normally walks slowly. Slowly. The magnet is different from your hand or your eyes. It attracts more iron from the ground. I have a strong magnet. I had only one, but I added three to it. Now, it is very powerful. You can't just walk at one place. You have to run about so you get more. Everywhere, you can find small iron on the ground. It is like money, but nobody owns it. Everyday, they fix a price for the metals. It is made in New York or so, and it is the same price all over the world. They change it every day and that is the money that I get. This is a good place. Here, I can work and make money. In my hometown, police would arrest me, but here, nobody cares. All the children work. The boys, collecting the iron, and the girls, they sell pure water. - This is your first time for me. Dust on my scale, why? - Because I need plenty, man. - You need plenty on the scale? - Yes, yes. - Huh? So this all, the sand inside? - No, no. - Are you sure? - No. - The first time you said there's no sand. - Oh, Lord, that's not sand. That's metal inside. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay, fine, you done well. This is 15 kilos. - No, no, no, no, no. - Why, it's 15 kilos, why? - No, no, no, no. - Are you blind? - This is 18. - 18? Okay, you are right, it's 18. Let me check the money give you. Oh, you don't wanna just see me work. Why are you watching my phone? - I want to see. - It's seven cedis. - What? No, no, no, no. - It's seven cedis, why? - This is nine cedis. - No you don't read nine cedi. - No, no, no, no. - You don't read nine cedi. Oh, I know there's weight-- - This heavy iron and you want to give me seven cedis. No, no, no, no. - Okay, don't worry, I'll do something. Don't worry, I'll give you one cedi. - What, one cedi? So, how much is it? - It'll be eight cedi, don't worry. - I said nine cedi, the last thing. See, that scale, it's not even good, the scale is hot. - Don't worry, I'm here for you, don't worry. I'll give you something, okay? Okay, you have it. Take this one. - How much I give you? - Take this one, don't worry. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Take that and go. - No, don't give me one cedi. - You like that one? - Then give me this one. It's okay. - Appreciate it. Okay, don't worry, go calm, okay? Don't keep blow it this time around, okay? - Okay. I'm not a lazy man. Any work God will give me, I will do! To make money and serve it. Me, I don't sleep. I will work hard, not like your white men. They are not used to work hard, because this is Africa. This is Sodom. You have to be like a lion. They call me Americo. My mother named me after the country, Americo. America. "It is the land of opportunity," she always said, when I was little. Opportunity for business. That is what they call it. I am a businessman. I like the dollar. I am dealing with scrap. I buy condemned things every morning. Every morning, I rent the truck and then I go. If you have anything that is brought in, I buy it. Fridges. Computers. Monitors. Phones. TVs. I buy it, dismantle it, and sell the aluminum, the copper, the zinc. In Europe, when things break, they throw them away. Once it is not valued anymore, they send it to us. But we, the Ghanaians, we know how to repair it. We can fix everything. And we know how to find the metals inside. We are the best recyclers. For them, it is just waste. But I can still squeeze some money out of it. The more waste they bring, the better it is for my business. They should send more. Good morning. - Good morning. - Where'd you get this? - My brother bring them from the EU. - From Europe. - Ah. - You want buy some things, you might look, see. So, how much, how much? - One. - One, for like this? - Yes. - Come down some more. - Say, 30 Ghana. - 30 Ghana. 30 Ghana. I'll take this. - Bring down for our side. - My brother bring down from EU. - Did you give our money? Give our money? - Oh, I give our money. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Right, see you tomorrow. The metals all go back to Europe or America. They pack it in containers and it goes on a ship, far away. Companies there, they buy it to build new things. From there, it comes and it goes back to their place, and one day, they will send it back to us. I know how to use computers. I don't know all of it, but if someone can teach me, I would know everything. Because, a computer is not difficult. It is like a phone. If I get a computer, I go and destroy it. I will burn it. I know the fire. I burn everything. Cables, monitors, computers. I will burn it and make fresh copper. The fire, that is my work. It is a powerful force. It is said that the fire is a monster that lives deep down under the ground, and tries to reach out to the skies. It is to be fed to keep it down there. They say the fire can make your heart black, deep inside. Nobody will see, but you will turn into a dark creature. A ghost, not a human. For me, it is a good thing. It separates the metals from the plastic. The fire always creates something new. Fresh copper. I understand how to control it, how to tame the monster. But the fire makes my body hot. It can hurt you. It can get inside of your body and fool you, making you sick. That is why I am smoking ganja. It makes my body strong. If I smoke, I don't feel the fire. I do not feel the heat. The ganja keeps me working. Sodom is a very special sound. The sound of work. Yeah, but it's not the sound of the machines. It's a human sound. The sound of people working. No other place has that sound. To me, it is like music. It runs through my veins. That is where my music comes from. - Oh, praise the Lord! Amen, amen. Oh, praise the Lord! Amen, amen. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. The word of God says... A damn is coming. Somebody will come to you. Follow me. Today, you rob money. And that is no god. That is no God. Those with God, they are four prophets. And I'm telling you, that's why (mumbles) says, it is appointed unto all mankind, all human race, both grandma and grandpa, both young and child, both boys and girls, both brothers and sisters, wants to die after they have children. Once you think that you can do anything you like, you can kill, you can do any wickedness, remember the Judgment Day. I'll sing one song, the Judgment Day. ♪ That Judgment Day ♪ ♪ That Judgment Day, that Judgment Day ♪ ♪ That Judgment Day ♪ ♪ That Judgment Day, that Judgment Day ♪ ♪ Is coming very soon ♪ Plenty people are going. They are going to Libya before they are entering Italy. Plenty people. But many of them die. They are killed on the road by criminals. They take their food and their money and let them die. They kill plenty people. Some drown in the ocean. I'm a man of the fire. I don't know how to swim. Me, I don't want to go like that. I tried to prepare well to go to Europe. I'm making my passport right now. I make it express. It only takes one month, but it is more expensive. I still have to pay them part of it when the papers are done. Next Friday, after the mosque, I will call the MP. Then, everything is finished. I will have my passport. I promise I will travel, I will go. Because in this Africa, there is nothing in sight. Rusev and Del Rio here on SmackDown! Physical tag team match between Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose. He has a big match at Fastlane looking to regain the United States Championship from Kalisto. - You see. - Yeah, white man, enjoy yourself. Because of the city. - Plenty of people, see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven people, they are eating. Their kitchen. See that white man. So what are you thinking about the white man? So my brother give me this phone. They are enjoying beach, see them. Hey, ice mobile. - That white man in house. See, they're in cab, big car cabs. See? - And house flowers, yeah. - Big flowers. Hey, this, I love it. I choose to live at the dump, because it's a sort of a no-man's land. People come and go. Everything is moving here. Nobody really asks too many questions. Everyone is on their own thing. It's a kind of a temporary safe house for me. But it's not a place where you stay too long. Once you get comfortable, this is when relationships get built, and that time, you are forced to be yourself, and there are other people who would not accept that. So you always have that in the back of your mind, that when the time comes to be real, then there will be challenges. I am from Gambia, but I have a different multi-background. I am also Jewish. I went to university, medical school, and I was top of my class. I was doing very well, but eventually, when the authorities found out that I was gay, my life changed from one moment to the other. Our president says, if they ever catch a gay person, they will cut off his head. They torture many of us. To cure us from this thing, they say. I will never forget these days in prison. That is why I'm hiding here. - D-Boy. - Yo. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. I wanna make you carry something for the voice inside, yeah, so you are ready? "You are welcome." You will descend, okay? Are you ready? All right. So, we go, only that one, only that one. Yeah. ♪ Welcome. ♪ - No, "you are welcome." Yeah, ready, we go. ♪ You are welcome ♪ ♪ You are welcome ♪ - No!

I was strong before I come here. Look at me! I am 44 years old and look like a 60-year-old woman. My body gets old very fast, since my husband died. Now I am too old to find a new husband who could take care of me. Look around. You will see only young, very young people. They come from all over Ghana and other countries, even, looking for work. But this is not a very comfortable place to grow old. Anyway, it is not a place where you get very old, usually. Time works differently on your body. This place eats up your life very fast. It is not good for the children to be here. The small, small children, like the ones I give the pure water to sell it. I work hard everyday so my son can go to school and is not coming here. I would not like to see him working at the fire. Men burn things. They are buying the water to cool their body and the burning copper. They work with fire, but they need the water. Fire and water. They are opposite. But like men and women, fire and water are working together. Every day. All the time. Everything works together here. I have many friends here. We talk and play and make fun a lot. But I also have to keep my secrets. That is why I shave my head and dress like the boys here. I am just like them. I can make much more money with collecting iron than I would make selling pure water. I am a boy. I never wanted to be a girl. I always wanted to be a boy since I was little. I am good in acting. I can act to be like this person, or I can act to be like that person. Like a chameleon. It always changes. It can change into blue or red or any color, and I can change into another person. I come from the north. It is the most beautiful land. The beauty of the north is the Savannah. The grassland. Everything is green and there are animals everywhere. Elephants, bush pigs, monkeys. It is the most beautiful nature you can imagine. The water in the river is clear and full of fish. And the air is cold. You can breathe. There is no smoke, just air. And it is very quiet. No people. It is not loud and dirty and busy. The north is incredibly beautiful, it is a true paradise. Sometimes I close my eyes. Then I go there and the world around me disappears. I just lay in the grass, like I used to, when I was a small boy. But these moments don't last very long. The hammering. The heartbeat of Sodom always takes me back to this life. That don't work, man. Okay, let me bring this one. This working? It's not working, okay. In this place here, the infirmary is not called for health. The mosquitoes are biting us every second. We have cholera, malaria and people are shitting everywhere. That makes us sick. But here is where the business is, and it is all about the money. You can say it is a paradise as well. A paradise for businessmen. - God want him to come and preach to Sodom and Gomorrah. To change from their wickedness. Because we've got dos and don'ts. They are killing human being too much. Even, do you know, they are sacrifice their children to their idols. A man can sleep with a man, homosexual. A woman can sleep, they are doing, hah. You can carry... Like, they will kill you all. Also bring you food and maize, and wheat, will kill you. But they don't care. They're allowed their own battalion, and the (mumbles) says our industry puts it into the ocean. He is ready. Sodom, if one person die and God can punish 44 billion people, he don't care. Because the people in Sodom and Gomorrah, they are too wicked. And the mighty God, Jehovah, Allah, Allah himself, when I say Allah, it means, God Almighty, Jehovah Emmanuel, the omnipresent and omnipotent God. So, now God want to tell his prophet Jonah. You know Jonah, he's from Jehovah, Allah. When I say Jehovah, it means Allah, the Supreme God. The Lord our God is one god. The God of Africa is the God of Antarctica. The God of Ghana is the God of Germany. The God of Ghana is the God of Chicago. The God of Africa is the God of Europe. The God of USSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, I'll call it communists, is all the same. I collect plastic, pure water plastic bags. After they drink it, they drop it. So, I pick it up and fill it up to one kilo. One kilo is 40 pesos. With that, I can buy two such bags of pure water. But you find many, many things. Strange things. If you are very lucky, you find money. I like literature, I like Shakespeare. He's one of my favorites. Bernard Shaw is a great writer, too. I like his plays, they cheer me up a little bit. I can flip through the pages and find a smile or two in it. Sodom is a tough place to be. Especially for a gay and Jewish person among Muslims. But I do not even know where to go. For people like me, it is hard to find a safe place. I would never fit in, nowhere. Fleeing all the time is a form of harassment on its own. Every time somebody is reminding you that you are different. Somebody's reminding you that you don't belong here. My dream is very, very... I would say, simple. I just want to be in a place where I don't have to be worried. Where there is no fear of being myself. Where I don't have to worry about being a gay person. And I don't have to worry about the fear that surrounds me. - Beep, beep, beep, beep! I have to live here, I want to go right now. Soon, I will get my passport. Then, I will travel. I want to be a pioneer for my family. Some people are doctors and bank managers and accountants. I want my child to be one of them. Because here, we are just Africans, but if I can make it to Europe, I really can be somebody. They have many stories. Scary stories. About the lagoon. This whole place is built on water. There is water under the ground. Sometimes, the ground moves under your feet when you walk. It happens that people sink into the ground and disappear. Every time they find a dead body in the water, they are telling a horror story. Sometimes, I am afraid, but the stories are only fairytales. I know that. And when I find out the truth about it, I am not scared anymore. This is why I want to learn about space in the internet they have inside the computers. Because I want to be an astronaut. Then I would know the truth about everything. The whole world. As an astronaut, I can go up high and see the land. The fires and the smokes of Sodom. I want to know about the space. I want to know the work that they normally do there. It is said there is a force in space. That there is different walking. They have a different walking that they use in space. Everything is different in space. Much better than down here. I want to find out all about space and how the Earth is, because people have been saying that the world is round, but I don't believe. So, I want to see with my own eyes. Then, I would believe. Then, I would see the truth of the world. I would know everything about it. I would find out the truth behind all the scary stories they tell and there would be nothing left to be afraid of. Because then, I could see all the people from above, but they cannot see me. When buying the scrap, I have to take a risk. I have to gamble. You never know what you get. If I'm lucky, I can make a big deal with a computer. If not, I still have the copper inside. That is still enough to buy a meal, and you always have tomorrow. Tomorrow, you can make the deal of your life, that will take you out of here. - Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Ban rod. Ban-Mm. Ban. Bana-Mm. Bana. Bar-if. Bar. Night club. When the old kings and the Arabs came, with their religions, they told us to believe. They told us, if we believe, everything will be possible. So, we did believe. And now, look around. But we are Africans. We still keep believing. In Europe, they have a saying. "Don't let the grass grow under your feet." So, we will move on. It's called sakawa. It's very common here. People do it. It is a voodoo ritual. What they normally do, young guys in search for money, wanting to become rich, as part of the ritual process, they have to sleep in a coffin for one night. All of them. In the morning, for most of them, nothing changes. But one will be a rich man. And one will be sacrificed and dies. I don't believe in magic and stories like this, but sometimes, I think this place is under a spell which holds us captive. Because Sodom is a beast, sometimes you kill the beast, and sometimes the beast kills you. Life here can be a piece of cake, and it can be hell's ditch. But you cannot get away from here. I will be here for the rest of my life. But when I die, they will take me to the north. They will take me home.
