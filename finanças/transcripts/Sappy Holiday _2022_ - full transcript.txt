The VIPs have arrived. How much longer on the scallops and risotto? - Risotto's ready. - Plating scallops. This needs more seasoning. It's under. It's fine. Okay, order up. Who are these VIPs? Oh, it's Cherie. I didn't think she'd be here today. Of "Cherie's First Impressions." Wanna take a bite? She's only the top restaurant blogger in the city. What is she doing here? I reached out on her social a few weeks ago to try and get some publicity for this place. A thumbs up from Cherie is a game changer. It was meant as a surprise for Pierre. Wow, you're really pulling out all the stops to get that chief executive chef position, aren't you? Sorry, I got that all but locked up. Pierre hasn't made up his mind yet and I'm just doing my job. Looking out for the restaurant. Let's hope Cherie loves her meal. I probably should've cooked that risotto longer. What? Uncle James. Merry Christmas! Hey, kiddo. - Oh-oh. - Hi, Mom. - Grandma, hi. - Hi. Oh. My family is all home for the holidays. I couldn't be happier. Oh, my goodness, Dillon, you've grown an entire foot since I last saw you. Who wants hot chocolate? - I do. - With marshmallows? Of course with marshmallows. How else would you have it? Come. Oh, it's so good to have you. Hi. I've been looking at the books. We need to talk about the farm. Can it wait? Not for long. Hello, Mother. How's the re-election campaign going? Very well, but it'll be a lot better once we get those engagement photos in the press. Do you think we need to hire a photographer? I'm pretty sure someone at the house could snap a photo if you really need one for the engagement announcement. Yes, I know you're looking forward to meeting her. Okay, I have to go. She'll be here any minute. Love you. - Hi. - Hey. Door was open, I just let myself in. How was your day? Busy. But, um, good. Good. So, you know how we talked about taking a trip up to Vermont to meet my parents? Uh-huh, we talked about it, but we... Don't be mad but I spoke with Pierre and arranged for you to take some time off. You spoke with Pierre? Yeah, he said that Antonio can handle it. Antonio, who I'm in competition with for executive chef, who can't even make a simple risotto? I can't be gone for Christmas. For how long? Eight days. Eight days? I've never taken eight days off in a row. It's sort of already a done deal. Hey, don't worry about the executive chef position. I'm sure you'll get it. I thought you would think it was romantic. You're right. It was very sweet. Christmas is beautiful in Vermont. My parents can't wait to meet you. My brother, Gil, and his girlfriend are heading up as well. You'll get to meet the whole family. Now, I'm flying up tonight, but Pierre said he needs you for tomorrow's lunch service, so you can head up after that. You can take my car. You couldn't wait so we could go down together? My mother has me meeting with a potential donor to the hospital. Okay. I will drive up tomorrow. Cherie posted her review. Hey, guys, we are here at Pierre's restaurant in New York City. Ambience, fabulous, but it is about the food. This is a restaurant, after all, so, I got the risotto and my BF got the scallops. What is my first impression? Ooh, unfortunately, this is gonna have to be a thumbs down from me. The risotto - crunchy, bland at best, and for a restaurant of this caliber, honestly, I expect a lot more, but, that being said, the scallops - delicious, highly recommend. Okay, see you guys next time. Don't forget to like and... I made the scallops. Okay, bye-ee! Uncle James, here's your hot chocolate. Thanks, Riley. Hey, how was your trip up? It was good. I love how much snow we got up here. Dad said you might have to sell the farm. Um, well, it's... a lot of work for one person. Maybe Dad can help. He'll never leave his job in the city. Maybe we can move up here and live on the farm. Now, that is a nice thought but what about school? Mom could homeschool us? I mean, Dillon doesn't like school anyways. Don't worry, Riley. I'll figure something out. Oh, did you see that? - A shooting star. - Yeah, make a wish. Your turn. Oh, okay. Hmm. Mm. What'd you wish for? More snow. But not too much. Just enough so that we don't have to tap early again. What about you? I can't tell you or it won't come true. Oh, great, now you tell me. I made hot cocoa. I tried to find some marshmallows but I couldn't find 'em. Why would I have marshmallows? I don't have any kids. Coaster. So formal? Yep, it's a re-election year. We'll be taking family photos for the papers. Anything special planned? Uh, you have to wait and see. I don't know if I have anything to wear. Just bring some nice dresses and heels and something formal to wear for dinner on Christmas Eve. Actually, it's more of a linner. Okay. So, do I call your dad Robert or Bob? Or Dr. Collins? Dr. Collins. Okay, and your brother is Gil and his girlfriend's Nancy, right? Mmhm. You got it. But I should warn you: my mother, she can be a bit particular. Oh, toiletries. Got everything? Yeah, that should do it. Morning. Good morning, Pierre. Thank you for the time off. I had no idea Gabe did that. And I'm sorry about the bad review from Cherie. I really thought that was gonna be great for us. Great. But I have a great idea for tonight's dinner service. I was thinking a Christmas amuse bouche. A cranberry goat cheese crostini with... Just because she liked your dish doesn't mean her review didn't hurt us. Stick to the menu. Yes, Chef. Pierre. What if we make some sort of Christmas amuse bouche? Sure, whatever you think. I trust you. - Joy. - Yes, Chef? Someone here to see you. Oh. Okay. Thanks. - Hey, Sweetie. - Hi, Dad. Thanks for coming in before we've even opened. Sorry this is all so rushed and that I won't be there for Christmas dinner. Here. For under the tree. Thanks, Dad. So, Gabe is whisking you off to Vermont. Yeah, I'm heading out soon, actually. I think Gabe is gonna propose to me on Christmas Eve. Oh, congratulations. I mean, we've only been dating for a couple of months. You don't think that's kind of fast? Oh, I only knew your mom for a month before I proposed to her. Of course, with your mom, I knew right away she was the one for me. Isn't that how you feel about Gabe? Yeah. I guess. I mean, I've always known I wanted someone stable, who had a good job and who supports me in my career. Someone who comes from a good family. That's definitely Gabe. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm probably just nervous about going to Vermont and meeting his parents. I mean, when you marry someone, you marry their family too, right? Well, you know how I feel about Gabe. He's a great guy and he'll make a great addition to our family. What? We're on a maple syrup farm. You sure you don't want some in your coffee? It's how you used to take it. And I started drinking it black when I moved away. Dad left us with lots of debt. I know and I had to buy a new evaporator. Which you haven't been able to make payments on. Tapping season was short last year and the year before that. And what happens when they repossess the equipment? We need to think about selling the farm. I found a buyer. The farm isn't for sale. With Dad gone, you'll have to hire additional help. How do you plan on doing that? I'll figure something out. The buyer wants to purchase a property before the end of the year for tax purposes. I told you, it isn't for sale. Look at these numbers. The farm is more than numbers, David. Our great-great-great grandfather built this house. Dad spent his entire life looking after the place. And what about Mom? This is her home. She can come live with us. And maybe you can move to the city as well. Get a fresh start. Maybe meet someone special. I have everything I need right here. No. No. No. Hello? Hey, have you left yet? Leaving now. I just had to make a quick stop. Haven't you seen the news? There's a huge snowstorm coming. Yeah, it's already started. I'm all dressed up, ready to meet your parents. I'll see you soon, okay? Okay, bye. Oh, Sweetie, can you run to the market to pick up a few things before the roads get bad? - Sure thing, Mom. - Thank you. Four inches of snow has already dropped up north so if you're driving in this, you better watch out for wintry conditions. Oh, no. Ahh. Oh. Oh. Ooh. Oh. Come on. Hello. I plowed into a snow bank. What? Is the car... The car is fine. I'm okay, too, I think. I assumed you're okay or you wouldn't have been calling. - Okay, but Gabe, I'm stuck. - What do you want me to do? I don't know, come and get me? But, if the roads are bad, how do you expect me to... The roads aren't bad. I just don't know how to drive in the snow... Don't your parents have four-wheel-drive? I have that meeting with the potential donor soon. And, besides, it'll take me forever to get there. Look, it'll be quicker if you justcall a tow truck and have them take you to the nearest mechanic, okay? Okay. Ooh. Oh, no, don't do that. You'll... Oh! Slip and fall. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Nice shoes. You might want to think about something a little more appropriate for the snow. Thanks for the suggestion, but... can you help me? I'm stuck. I'll see what I can do. Hey, um, did you spin the wheels? I tried to back out. Yeah. Smell that? You might've blown the transmission. Oh, no. Is that an easy fix? Yeah, as long as the mechanic has the right parts. Where's the nearest mechanic? Charlie? I saw him closing up shop. In case you didn't notice, there's a big snowstorm coming. Is there another mechanic? Up in Huntington. - Oh, where's that? - About three hours north. Can I catch a taxi? Car rental? Even if there was a car rental place, which there isn't, wouldn't matter. All the roads up north are closed. Where is the nearest hotel? - Up in... - Let me guess: Huntington? Yeah. Gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? Sleep in my car? Freeze to death? Certainly hope not. Look, I wouldn't let that happen to anyone. You can come stay with us at our family farm. If you like. I don't even know you. No offense. Forgive me. James Lewis. Lewis Maple Farms. You are? Joy Johnson. JJ. Well, it's nice to meet you, JJ. Oh, here. - I'm fine. - Are you sure? Thanks for the offer but how do I know you're not some sort of psycho? What? Psychos can be charming. James, you okay? Uh... Yeah, hi, Mom, I'm fine. But a lady plowed into a snowbank. Oh, no. Is she okay? Bring her to the house before she freezes. I would but she's worried I'm some sort of psychopath or something. Stop fooling around. I'll have hot chocolate waiting. How do I know your mom's not in on it? Suit yourself. Wait! Let me grab my things. Someone went on a shopping spree. They're, uh... Gifts. Oh, my! I got you. You, uh... You really ought to invest in some snow boots. Probably a good idea. Um, let me get these. Thank you. Sorry if I was... weird back there. I was just trying to make sure it was safe. Well, those shoes definitely aren't safe. Ha-ha. Very funny. Funny and charming. Wow. Two compliments in one day. You're not from around here, are you? No. I live in New York City. What are you doing driving up north in the middle of a snowstorm? I was trying to get to Burlington before the snowstorm hit, but... It's a long story. Must be really important. Yeah, it is. I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents. Mm. And he is going to propose to me on Christmas Eve. Congratulations. I wasn't supposed to know. But I overheard him talking to his mom and then I saw the ring in his suitcase. You must be excited. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Gabe's a great guy. He's smart and responsible and successful. He's practical. He's an anesthesiologist. What? So, he, literally, puts people to sleep for a living. Are you implying that he's boring? - No. - He is anything but boring. What do you guys do for fun? Fun? Yeah, you know, for pure joy. Like your name. Well, we, uh, we're both... very focused on our careers. I'm a chef and I'm trying to become an executive chef. And he's really busy with work, so... What do you do for fun? Well, I take care of the family maple farm. That's fun. Even though I work 60-plus hours a week. When my niece comes up, we build snow castles. Like to snowshoe, hike, bird watch. I enjoy being out in nature and spending time with my family. How do you have time for fun when you work 60-plus hours a week? I make time. For myself and the people I love. Well... I haven't had a vacation in forever. Gabe arranged for my time off as a surprise. It was very romantic. Well, whatever makes you happy. I am happy. Very happy. You live here? It's absolutely beautiful. And so fresh. Well, there you are. Glad you made it home safe. And this is...? - JJ. - Joy. Hm, nice to meet you. Well, come on inside before you freeze to death. I made hot chocolate. Oh. Wow. You have a beautiful home. Well, thank you very much. Come in. Uncle James. Glad you made it back. Who's this? Joy. Nice to meet you. I heard you got stuck in the snow. Yeah. Well, the roads can get pretty bad up here, but James is a good driver. Well, I really appreciate you letting me stay here. I'm just glad you're okay. And that Uncle James found you. Want to decorate some Christmas ornaments? Oh, Riley, I'm sure JJ has no interest in... Actually, I'd love to but I should probably get some sleep. It's been a long day and I've got a lot of driving to do tomorrow. We should get them some hot chocolate. Yeah? Okay, let's go. I'll grab your bags and show you to your room. Thanks. I hope this is okay. It's great. Thank you. If you need anything, there's always someone around to help. Oh, could you bring me to the mechanic first thing tomorrow morning? Sure thing. I was getting worried. Is everything sorted out? I almost called a search team. Almost? Where are you? At a hotel? I'm at a man's... A family's maple syrup farm. You're staying with a complete stranger? Well, I didn't have any other options. There are no hotels in the area and the mechanic shop is closed. They're taking me there first thing tomorrow morning. Okay, well, my mother arranged for brunch at Magenta. It's an exclusive restaurant that's hard to get into. I was really hoping you'd be here by then. Well, I'll do my best. I should get some sleep. I'll keep you posted. Okay. Bye. Brought you some hot cocoa. Thank you. You put marshmallows in it. Uncle James says there's no other way to have it. He is absolutely right. Your family has a beautiful place here. I love it, especially around Christmas time. I think it's magical. Hm. I think you might be right. Good morning. You must be JJ. Joy. Hi. - I'm Rebecca, Riley's mom. - Oh, nice to meet you. And this is my son, Dillon. Sometimes I swear these headphones are glued to his head. Ooh, something smells good. Oh, good morning. I made pancakes. Looks delicious and I'm starving, but I really can't stay. Good morning. I, uh, already called the tow truck. The car should be at the mechanic's. I'll bring you there now? Thanks. And thank you for your hospitality. It was so nice meeting you all. Please, tell Riley I say goodbye. - You must be Joy. - That's me. Is my car ready? I'm sorry to tell you it might be a few days. I have to special order a part. - A few days? - Maybe a week. What? No, I... I have somewhere I need to be. I'm sorry, ma'am. This is Christmas time. Thanks, Charlie. I'll do my best to get it as fast as I can. I know you will. Looks like you get to enjoy those pancakes after all. - Okay, and you're all done. - Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. Look who's back. JJ! You're-you're staying? For how long? Long enough that I can probably help you with those ornaments. Really? That'd be great. You still have some of those pancakes, Mom? Well, sure do. Come, have a seat. Great, they look delicious. Oh, it's my pleasure. Uh, Dillon? Dillon. Yeah, why don't you take those off for a bit? We have company. He plays video games all day long. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. Okay, you two. That's enough. You guys are so lucky to have fresh maple syrup from your farm. Maybe not for much longer. Dillon, why don't you come outside and help me? Dillon, it would be good to go outside and get some fresh air instead of being glued in front of your computer all the time, huh? - I could use the help. - I'm good. I could help after breakfast. It's hard labor. What makes you think I can't do hard labor? I just thought you might like to relax. I'm used to working. And you're clearly not dressed... Ah, we have clothes here she can borrow. Great! Okay. And some pancakes for you? Yes, please. So, what are we doing? Checking the lines. These lines carry sap from the trees down to the sugar shack. So, when do you tap? Usually mid-February. When the daytime temperatures rise above freezing and the nighttime temperatures drop below. The temperature change is what moves the sap along the trees. Hm. And how many taps you have? About 8,000. Wow, that's a lot. It takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. - Really? - Mm-hm. That's crazy. You do all this by yourself? My dad and I used to do it together. He passed away earlier this year. Oh, I'm so sorry. The rest of your family, they must help out, right? They don't live here anymore. Just up for the holidays. Riley tries to help when she's here, but she's more energetic than capable. And I try to get Dillon to help, but he's more interested in his video games. I worry about him sometimes. Maybe he just needs to figure out what he enjoys. Maybe. What about your family? Oh, my mom passed away a long time ago and my dad and I... We're not very close. We both work a lot. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about your mom. Thanks. It's okay. You know, nothing beats the smell of steam from the sugar shack. You should really come back during tapping season. I'd like that. I mean, you and your... soon to be fiancé, of course. Of course. I know what you meant. You know, I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't high-tail it down here after you. Well, he has business to attend to and, with the weather, it's just not practical. Practical? If my lady were stranded, I'd move heaven and earth to get to her. Is there a lady in your life? Oh, there's lots of ladies in my life. My mom, Riley, sister-in-law. That took all morning. Thank you for your help. I've got to be honest, I didn't expect it. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you know, when I... first met you, I got to admit, I thought you were hoity-toity. Hoity-toity? Are those even words? Yeah, you know, like, you drive a fancy car, you wear fancy clothes. Those shoes were definitely... hoity and toity. Okay, well, the car is Gabe's and the clothes... Well, just proves you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Oh, hey. Would your mom be okay with me cooking for you guys tonight? I'd really like to pay you back for the hospitality. I'm sure she'd love that. Great. Hey, Dillon. Uh, could you grab me the carrots? They're the orange stick-like things. Thanks. Uh, could you whisk this for me? You do know how to whisk, don't you? I've seen cooking shows. Good. Do you like cooking shows? Um, I guess. I like when the one chef yells at everyone. Well, most chefs aren't like that. They aren't? Well, I'm not like that. Have you ever cooked salmon? No. Wanna give me a hand? You could be my sous chef. Okay, sure. So, for the main course, we have maple-glazed salmon with... A maple-bacon-pumpkin risotto. Oh, wow, this looks amazing. I had no idea you were a chef. This is such a treat. Oh, and don't forget the maple-roasted carrots. Mm. Looks and smells delicious. Well, Dillon helped. He's a natural in the kitchen. - He is? - Absolutely. - Well, isn't that something? - All right, buddy. Thank you. Well, dig in! Yes. Oh, the salmon looks so good. And, Dillon, you helped. Want some of these, kiddo? Thank you. Are you sure I can't help? You made dinner. I'll clean up. That was really great what you did with Dillon. I've been trying to get him engaged with things around here and he's just not interested. Just like I said... he just needs to figure out what he's passionate about. Well, I can tell you're passionate about cooking 'cause you're amazing. A-a-an amazing chef. Can we make Christmas ornaments now? Oh, yeah, I'd love to as long as your Uncle James is sure he doesn't want my help with these dishes. Uncle James? I think I got it under control. Great. Let's go make some decorations. Let's go. Every year, I make a different ornament. I made that one last year. Well, that is beautiful. You are very talented. Thank you. This year, we're making magical wish ornaments. Magical wish ornaments. What are those? Well, you take a piece of colored paper and you write down your wish. Then you put it inside and you decorate it all in glitter, but... you can't tell anyone your wish or it won't come true. Okay, I think I got it. I already made a wish upon a star, so, this is my backup plan. Got it. Where do we start? Well, piece of paper. - Okay. - And then, oh! Oh, okay. Yes, and then you write your wish. She's really something, isn't she? Yeah. She is. There you are. Oh. Thank you. So, you were right. It's beautiful up here. You're so lucky. I can't remember the last time I did crafts or cooked for someone outside of work or just looked at the stars. So, it took you plowing into a snowbank to get you to slow down. It'll all be worth it when I'm an executive chef. What about you? Any big dreams outside of running the maple farm? Ho, that is a big one. Um... Hm. Just keeping my family together. Having my own family one day. Teaching my kids how to tap and about the history of this place. Was it always your dream to run the farm? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And... after my dad died it became that much more important to me. All of our memories are here. This place is much more than just a farm to me. It's a life I love. It's home. You're lucky to have that. I hope to have that someday. You don't have that with Gabe? I... Yeah. I should-I should probably turn in. Uh... Thanks. Um, good night. Good night. Hello. I thought you'd keep me posted. You missed lunch. Sorry. Must've slipped my mind. I was helping with chores and then I cooked dinner and... Wait, they're making you work? They're not making me work. I love to cook. I was just... Okay, well, any updates on the car? Hopefully it'll be ready tomorrow but, um, I'll call you when I know for sure. Okay? Okay. Good night. Good night, Gabe. There you are. Look, man, we need to talk. I'm about to go outside with the kids. Have you given any more thought to selling the place? Not now, David. We don't want to miss this opportunity. Look, I said not now. Morning! Sorry, am I interrupting? No. Nothing that can't wait. You need to make a decision soon. Good morning, Joy. What was that about? Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing. Dillon and Riley are outside playing in the snow. You want to join us? Absolutely. What are you guys doing? We're building a snow castle. My brother and I used to make them all the time. Well, how come he's not out here helping? He's too busy with work. Well, you got me. But, before we get started... Snowball fight! Oh. This means war. Ah! Help me, help me. Get him! No! Ooh. Are these the shoes you said I should get? Ha-ha. This is a lot harder than it looks. Hello. Miss Johnson, it's Charlie. Your car is ready. Oh. Okay. Um... I'm not sure when I'll be able to get there. I'll let you know. - Everything okay? - Mm-hm. Come on. And then... you have a snowflake. Ah. Beautiful. I remember making these when I was little. Ooh, what is that? It smells delicious. Nana's famous pumpkin bread. With some whipped maple butter made with the maple syrup from our farm. Mm. That is so good. You could sell this. Well, coming from you, dear, that's a huge compliment. She only makes it on special occasions. We're trying to wean the kids off sugar. - Need some help, Nana? - Oh, I would love some. Come. So, Rebecca, how did you and David meet? We met in college. - Oh, what'd you study? - I studied interior design. Cool. I didn't get a chance to put my skills to use. Um... I got pregnant with Dillon in college. It was one of those life swerves. - Life swerves? - Yeah, like... life's taking you this way, then... swerve. Best detour of my life. Then Riley came along and... here we are. And, uh, what about David? He majored in business. No surprise there. Now he works at a big financial corporation. I don't mean to pry, but... what's the deal with him and James? You've been here only a couple of days and you already see it. Kind of hard to miss. They used to be so close, but David feels that James resents him for going away to college and leaving him with the farm. David also says it doesn't make financial sense to keep the farm. The place has been in the family for generations. James would never consider selling and I get it. David and I got married here. - You did? - Yeah. That's so special. It was perfect. You must have a lot of fond memories of this place. I mean, I've only been here a couple days and I already do. The kids have been coming here since they were babies. It'd break my heart to see it go. Well, I really hope it all works out. For you and your family. Me too. What are you doing? Making maple sugar and a couple treats? You want to help? Yeah, sure. Great. Okay, one cup of sugar in there. Got a good eye. Hm. Hey, Uncle James, can I tell you something? Sure. Okay, remember when we made a wish upon a star? - Mm-hm. - Well, I wished that... Wait, hold on. I thought you weren't supposed to tell me because it won't come true. But it already did come true. I wished that someone would show up to save the farm, and... she did. Wait a minute, you think... Oh, Sweetie, look... I can understand why you might think that, but... Joy being here is just a coincidence. And she's leaving. I don't want you to get your hopes up. No, she's here to save the farm. I know it. What are you two doing? Making maple sugar. Wow, looks good. You two are really becoming quite the team. Well, he's a quick apprentice. Oh, you have a little, um... A little flour on your... Oh, no, it's right here. - So, what's the next step? - Right! Um... Um, I have a-a place I'd love to show you when you're done here. - Okay. - An hour? Sounds good. Okay, grab a pot and bring the sugar over and we'll move on to the next step. Hey, you've reached Dr. Gabe Collins. Leave a message and I'll our return your call as soon as possible. You're really good with Dillon and Riley. You and Gabe plan on having kids? I have no idea. We haven't talked about it. We're both so busy with work. Well, you're getting engaged. I'm surprised you haven't talked about it. Well, this is the first cabin my great-great-grandfather made on this property. We've renovated, but... this place, right here, it was just him and the forest. And the syrup. It's beautiful. Come on. And this... is my maple liqueur. - You made this? - Uh-huh. You're not the only creative one. This is good. Really good. My grandpa would make maple syrup right here. This was his sugar shack. Humble beginnings and all that. Yeah, I like to come here and think about those early days. Out here surrounded by beauty, surrounded by nature. What it must have been like. You know, the work involved in... setting the foundation for future generations. Out here, I feel like I'm one with everything. You know. The trees, the deer the stars... The owls, the people who came before us. This place just feels like home. That's sweet. Pun intended? You know, I wonder if my dad and grandfather felt the same way that I do. I'm sure they did. You got it from somewhere. I overheard you and your brother talking. Is there a chance you might lose the maple farm? Uh... Well, I've fallen behind on payments and I just can't seem to catch up. I've been wishing for a Christmas miracle. You wouldn't happen to have a few of those, would you? Wish I did. Wish I had a few of them. What would you wish for? The executive chef position, I think. You see, I thought you loved being creative. Wouldn't you wish to run your own place? I don't know. I guess I'm still figuring it all out. My dad wanted me to go to medical school, and then I decided to become a chef so I still feel like a huge disappointment sometimes. Which, I guess, is why I'm working so hard to get this promotion at work. You know, it would mean something. Is that what you want? I want to make my dad proud. How could he not be? But I get it. Yeah, I just... Want my dad to be proud of me, too. I guess we have a lot more in common than I thought. Yeah. It's been such a long time since I felt so at ease somewhere. Like I didn't have to work to try and prove anything. Like, I can just open up with you. You can. I really love being here. Well, I really love having you here, JJ. - I can't. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I'm getting engaged to Gabe. - I know, I'm sorry. - James... I don't know what... this is but it... It isn't real. Wha... It feels real to me. Well, it can't be. James, this place is... magical. But, sometimes in life, you have to think with your head. Not your heart. You have to make decisions that are practical. Pra- Well, is that what you really want? I should go. Um... Yeah, okay, we'll head back to the house. No, I mean I should-I should go. Head up to Burlington. Um, can you take me to get my car tomorrow morning? It's ready. Um, sure. Thank you. We need to talk. The buyer sent me the offer and it is very generous. It will get us out of debt and give you that fresh start. It's the practical thing to do. I'll do whatever you decide. I think maybe it's time I stopped thinking with my heart. Are you leaving? Yeah. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. My car is ready. You can't. You're my wish come true. What? The other night, Uncle James and I, we made a wish upon a star and I wished that someone would come save the farm and then... And then I showed up. What did James wish for? Snow. Just the right amount, though. Riley, this is all just a coincidence: the snowstorm, my car... Believe me, if there was something I could do, I would. Please, you have to do something. We can't lose the farm. You know how much this means to Uncle James and to me? You see it, right? The magic? I do. I do see it. More people need to see it. I loved having you here. It felt less empty with more rooms filled. I'll miss you. Good night, Joy. Good night. Riley... How many extra rooms are there? I don't know why I didn't think of this before but, with all those extra rooms, why not turn this place into a bed and breakfast? There's no other hotel for miles and you could turn the maple farm into a tourist attraction. Rebecca, you could put your interior design skills to use and you would be an amazing hostess. You could even sell your pumpkin bread. And the maple sugar. I have tons of contacts in the restaurant industry. And you, you could give educational tours. You're amazing at explaining how everything on the farm works. And people would come from all over to see how the maple syrup gets made. And not just during tapping season. You could have events all year, like wildlife tours. - What about cooking lessons? - Yeah, and weddings. I love the idea of weddings here. Our day was so special, remember? And, David, maybe you could help with the business and financial side of stuff. Well, David? What do you think? I guess we could try and raise the money. I'll call the creditors, but I may have to pull in a few favors. Thank you. We could have the grand opening on Christmas Eve. I thought you were supposed to be... I could stay. A little longer. Just 'til things get going, and... I mean, we have to try, right? Christmas Eve is only... But there's seven of us. I think we can pull it off if we all work together. What do you think? Lewis B&B on three: One, two, three! Lewis B&B! They were there for me and now I'm gonna help them. But what about time with me and my family? I'll be back for linner on Christmas Eve. I gotta go. How are we going to get people out here? I have an idea. Hey, everyone, I'm here at the Lewis Family B&B on their beautiful maple syrup farm with my friend, Riley. Hi, everyone. We need to get the word out about this place. This place is a hidden gem and we're hoping to have our grand opening on Christmas Eve. Any influencers out there want that first review? DM me for details and I'll hook you up with the best holiday getaway. Okay. Here goes nothing. Tagging Cherie. Send. Here we are. About... what happened between us the other night at the cottage. Yeah. Our conversation got me thinking about a lot of things. Like what? Like how I am always trying to prove my worth. You know, those bags in the trunk. The gifts? They aren't gifts. They are clothes that I bought to impress my in-laws. Oh, so, so they're the hoity-toity ones. I'm still not sure those are words. But, yeah, I guess they are the hoity-toity ones. That's why I got stuck in the snowstorm. I was late heading out because I went shopping for clothes to impress them. And if I'm being honest with myself, I don't even know if I really want this executive chef position. I just want to be... Fulfilled. My family and I are... so grateful for... For everything. But you know you don't have to do this, right? I'm doing this because I want to. It brings me joy. Dillon, we could really use your help. I am helping. I made a website for the B&B. Oh my gosh, this is amazing. Looks like all that screen time wasn't a waste of time. And how many can I put you down for? Great. Thank you. David. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm worried about Riley. She thinks we're going to move up here and live on the farm. Well, would that be so bad? Sounds like you and James have a lot of fond memories of growing up here. Yeah, that was the past. Well, it doesn't have to be. Seems like the kids like it up here. True. Dillon's really thriving and Riley loves it up here. I haven't seen Rebecca this excited about anything in a long time. Like, when we first got married. Being happy. That's what everyone wants for their family, right? Yeah, but I'm used to working in the city. Yeah, me too. Life swerve? Life swerve. - How's that look? - Perfect. Really ties it all together. Cherie is coming. Is that a good thing? It's a very good thing. Time for a snow break. - Is that a thing? - It is now. Snow castle! Snow castle! Oh. Hey, David. Why don't you join us? We're making snow castles. It'll be like old times. Nah, I got a ton of work to do inside. Well, you know where to find us. Hey, James. Wait up. There's going to be a gate there. - Perfect, we have a moat? - Yeah. So, you already know that we have our own ornaments. We wanted you to have one. Oh, thank you. You're part of the family. Oh. Ah, okay, now, who's gonna help me make welcome baskets? - We will. - Oh, good. You too? - Yep. - Come. No one's ever made me feel so at home. Not even Gabe? Not even Gabe. Well, you'll always have a home here. We're really gonna miss you, JJ. I wish I could stay for the grand opening tonight. Oh, we don't want you to leave either, dear, but we know you have a life you need to get back to. And you've done everything imaginable. So you don't forget me. Oh. I could never forget you. It's been so nice getting to know you both. Oh, you, too. Thank you for everything you did with Dillon. - Yes. - Yeah. Where is he? He's in his room. You know, he's just not so good with goodbyes. Me either, but please tell him I'm glad he's found a couple things he's passionate about. Yes, finally. This is for you. It doesn't go with your outfit, but... Are you kidding? Oh. I love it. And don't be a stranger. If you're ever passing through, please, come stay with us. I will. Well, I'm sure tonight's grand opening will be a huge success. And Cherie will give you a big thumbs up. For the road. With love from our farm made with your maple sugar. Thank you. For your hospitality. You're like family, Dear. You ready? Yeah. Bye. Hey, thanks, Charlie. - Merry Christmas, James. - You as well. I'm appreciative... of everything you've done. You've changed our lives and... I just want you to be happy. You deserve the best. So do you. Joy's on her way, then? Yeah. Off to a whole different world. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I know you were really starting to like her. I was. She was something special. Oh, honey, come here, give your mom a hug. Hey. Oh. I should get ready. Guests will be arriving soon. Yes, so exciting. Stupid shoes. Okay. Hello?! Gabe? Hello? Wow. This place could give Martha Stewart a run for her money. Gabe? Doctor and Mrs. Collins? There you are. I was starting to wonder if you were gonna show. You knew I was coming today. Mm. Where is everybody? My parents are at a fundraising event and my brother's working. Working? So late on Christmas Eve? Come on. I'll show you to your room. Oh, let me help you with these. Thanks. Wow. This is so fancy. I'll let you get settled. If you need anything, let me know. No, I don't think I'll need anything. Looks like everything's covered. Hey, Gabe. Do you want to go outside and play in the snow? Are you kidding? It's freezing outside. Come on, it'd be fun. I could teach you how to build a snow castle. - A snow castle? - Hm. Ah, you've got some glitter on your cheek. Oh. Nope. There you go. Besides, there's no time. You have to get ready for this afternoon. Oh, I kind of thought you and I would get to spend some time together. Joy, are you okay? What makes you ask? I don't know. You seem different. Huh, I guess it makes sense after the traumatic experience you've just been through. Ah, duty calls. Hm. Ah, there's the culprit leaving the glitter. No, Gabe, don't. Don't throw that out. Well, okay. Dillon said he saw you head out this way. Things seem to be going well back at the farm. Or should I say bed and breakfast? You think we'll be okay? Think things are looking up. I'm sorry. For being distant all these years. I guess, at first, I resented you for... going to college and leaving me here to care for the farm. I'm sorry for leaving you with all the work. Nah. Truthfully, never felt like work to me. I think I was born for this. I should actually thank you. If I'm being totally honest, I've had a lot of fun being back here. Maybe it's time I start thinking with my heart. Come on. Ah. That concludes the tour of the Collins Estate. Feel free to tip your guide. Everything is so... pristine. Mm-hm, that's usually how it goes. I have to make a few phone calls. You make yourself at home, okay? Okay. Oh, hello. Oh, hi. You must be Joy. - Yeah. - I'm Gil. Gabe's much better-looking brother. Nice to finally meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, Joy. I'm Nancy. I'm Gil's girlfriend. Please, call me JJ. Well, JJ, we hear that you're an entrepreneur extraordinaire. Entrepreneur? Extraordinaire. I can't wait to hear all about it over linner. And, speaking of which, if you'll excuse me, I have some work I need to finish up. Oh, and I need to get ready for the big event so I will chat with you later. Oh, and you are... Gone. I will stay here by myself. On Christmas Eve. I don't get to do my nails like this often. Oh... My... Gosh! Hurry, come on! This is the best. The drive here... Amazing. And this... So cute, so cozy. Well, make yourselves at home. Welcome to the Lewis Family Bed and Breakfast Maple Syrup Farm. Hello. That's a mouthful. Wait 'til breakfast. - Ooh. - Enjoy. I tell you, I haven't seen him in such a long time. Doesn't he look the same? He does look the same. He's quite the talker, isn't he? Are you using scissors on my sofa? I'm so sorry. I didn't know. She's very protective of the furniture. I just thought some... Some homemade decorations might be nice for... For Christmas. Now, Mayor Collins, Dr. Collins, it's so nice to finally meet both of you. I'm JJ. Joy... Johnson. Oh, nice to meet you, Joy. We've heard so much about you. Did Gabe tell you that we're having an early Christmas Eve dinner followed by an after-party in the evening? After-party? No, he didn't mention... Dinner's at three o'clock sharp. Formal attire. Sorry, she could be a bit much. Especially with the stress around the re-elections. Gabe and Gil take after her. Oh, could I help with dinner? We've hired caterers for that. Oh, it's no trouble. I love to... Cook. That's a funny story. Uh, no, thank you. Are you sure I can't help with the food? I love to cook. Honey, it's Christmas Eve. I know. I just... I know it's not surgery, but I can spatchcock a chicken in seconds. I'm gonna, um... Is it something I said? You told your family that I'm a chef, right? I told them you were an entrepreneur. What? I mean, that explains why your brother called me an entrepreneur extraordinaire but why would you... One day, I know you'll develop some secret sauce or something that will revolutionize the restaurant industry. Guess that's why they didn't get my joke. Gabe... are you embarrassed of me? No, no, not at all. I just... You're going to be an executive chef one day. It's Pierre. You should answer that. No, seriously, you should. It could be good news. It's Christmas Eve. Whatever it is can wait. No, it can't. 'Cause after all the strings that I pulled... What did you just say? Nothing. It's just that I told Pierre that if you were the executive chef, I would have no problem referring other doctors and... You don't think I can get this promotion on my own? - Of course I did, I just... - Gabe! I do not want your help when it comes to my career. When I'm stuck in a snowbank stranded in the middle of nowhere, that's when I'd like your help. But not when I'm trying to get a promotion at a place that I have worked my tail off for years. Can we talk about this after dinner? Don't you mean linner? Linner's ready. Cherie, I have the most decadent Swiss hot chocolate with our signature maple marshmallow. Swiss? I love Swiss. Thank you. Oh, cheers. If I'm going to eat carbs... Now that dinner's finished, I would like to propose... I'm sorry, I... I have to go. A toast. Hey, guys, welcome back. We are here at the Lewis Family Farmhouse, which is a maple tree farm and bed and breakfast. What is my first impression? It is a home away from home. Come on, let's go check it out. I knew it. Hey. What's going on? We need to talk. Yeah. What happened over there? Gabe, I can't marry you. How did you find out? I was doing my best to keep it a secret. I overheard you talking to your mom. And I saw the ring in your suitcase. Don't you think we'd be rushing into this? I thought the timing was right. We've only known each other for a short while and... Wait, you thought the timing was right for us or for your mom's election campaign? Heh, couldn't it have been for both? Not for something as important as getting married. I assume the answer's a no? No. I'm sorry, Gabe. I thought we had something good here. We did. I just... I just don't know if what we have is enough. When we first met, we hit it off because we were both so driven and focused on our careers, but I've realized that there's more to life than just work. I want to have fun, you know, and enjoy life. I want to build snow castles and... make Christmas ornaments. Joy, this doesn't sound like you at all. That's just it. I think I'm thinking clearly for the first time. This is me. Does this have anything to do with you being up at that maple farm? This is about me and what I want. Yes, I want to be more creative and make my own menu. But I also want to be with someone who believes in me. Who loves me for who I am. You didn't think I could get that promotion on my own. And you didn't come get me when I was stranded. I told you, I had to be here for my mother's campaign. I know. And it's okay. Honestly, it's okay because I think, if you look inside your heart, you know that we're not right for each other. So, what happens next? We say goodbye. Gabe, I wish you nothing but the best. And, please, give your family my apologies. Tell your mom she's got my vote. Oh, and one more thing. I need to borrow your car. Lewis Family Farm. May I help you? Riley, it's JJ. Is Nana around? Um, Nana's busy. We're getting lots of reservations. That's great. Um, can you tell her I'm on my way back to the farm? You are? Yeah. But don't tell James. Or anyone else. I want it to be a surprise. Okay, I'll get your room set up. Thanks, kiddo. I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye. Heavy snow continues to fall. Officials are encouraging everyone to stay off the roads if possible. Not again. Messy, messy, messy. Thank you for all your help, kiddo. Great news, Riley. Weather forecast is calling for another five or six inches of snow. Oh-oh, I hope JJ makes it. What did you just say? JJ told me not to. When did you talk to JJ? Riley, you need to tell your uncle James what you know. She's coming back to the farm. In this weather? Help! Oh, no, don't do that. You'll... slip and fall. JJ. James? What are you doing here? Riley told me. That was supposed to be a secret. It's a good thing I got to you. What are you doing driving in this? Aren't you supposed to be getting engaged? I broke up with Gabe before he could propose. You did? Yes, we weren't right for each other. I'm sorry. I'm not. Wha... Sometimes things look good on paper but they're not right for you. You have to follow your heart and my heart led me back to you. It's hard to explain but when I'm with you, I feel like me. The real me. Not the little girl constantly trying to prove her worth. When I'm with you and your family at the farm it feels like home. I don't know what this looks like either, but... What I'm trying to say is I think I need to buy some snow boots because I'd really like to stay. I can't believe you drove in this weather to get me. I told you... I'll move heaven and earth to get to my lady. Norm, thank you for coming. James, thanks for having me. Wow, this is lovely. Come on, let me introduce you to the family. Sure. Dad? What are you doing here? Well, this wonderful young man told me how my wonderful daughter saved him and his maple farm and... I wanted to tell you in person how proud I am of you. I can't believe you're here. Merry Christmas, Sweetie. Merry Christmas, Dad. Oh, come in. Make yourself at home. - Thank you. - Did you want some hot cocoa? I sure do. I, um... Have something I want to show you. Okay. What's going on? Just a little further. Okay. Open. When did you do this? The whole family helped out. Even David. It's absolutely magical. You deserve all the magic. Come on. One night last December, I made a wish for... more snow. And Riley wished that someone would show up and save our farm. And you did. You really are our Christmas miracle. I knew after only a week that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. You've brought so much joy into my life. Pun intended. Will you marry me? You make me the happiest guy in the world. Yes. This is the sappiest thing anyone has ever done for me.
