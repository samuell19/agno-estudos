Arses... Arses... Nothing like awesome arses. Oh man, Mattis, Mieke is not coming anymore. I must have missed the train. Oh man, we can already lie on the beach. What about chicks and so on? What do we do instead? Get your sister off the train. Crazy. To be continued... Hi Mattis, what are you doing here? Hi Lena, I'm waiting for Mieke. Your next visit is in an hour. Will you take me home? Dad, don't turn it off. I'm not doing anything. Oh, Mathis, the trick is really old. But it still works. Yes, of course. That's it. Now I know what I missed the last few weeks. We can eat at half an hour. At the end of the day, there is Mieke's favorite food. You ungrateful children. Thank you for picking me up, brother Herz. I was at the station, but you didn't come. Have you heard anything about waiting? Well, I met Lena. What do you have to do with Lena all of a sudden? Well, I carried her bag home and... And? And then her mother came. Oh, and she's still on you, isn't she? Oh, Mattis, my dear, could you oil your back? Something like that. You won't believe it, it was pretty boring without you. No one else who steals my t-shirts or my pens. Life is really boring as a single child. Oh, it was actually quite relaxing with grandma. Hello, is Jan in? Hello. You are Mieke, right? Mieke? This is... Simona. I've heard a lot about you. That's interesting. I have to go to the kitchen. I'll come with you. How long has it been? A while. Oh, I couldn't stand it without you. Simona, not the children now. Your children are not so small anymore. We have to be careful. Mieke... Your daughter and I, we will understand each other wonderfully. That's what I thought about the rumor. It just pops in here. Dad got it. He's listening to Eros Ramazotti now. And when you're in the car with him, he suddenly turns the radio on and says, this is our song. Well, love makes him stupid. And how is she like that? She stands on men like Jan, listens to Eros Ramazotti and comes to our school as an English teacher. Aha. I always thought fathers are too stupid to put the open grill and decorate the Christmas tree. But that they also have to fart. I thought it was over when I was 40. I think that will never stop. Why did you straighten that again? Don't you like it? It's a typical Mika earring. My other face. Mathis? I'm glad I'm back with you. . So far away, so far away. Yes, also a paparazzo. Yes, also a paparazzo. May I put on your T-shirt? Like before? Yes, like before. Copyright WDR 2018 Ah, Miss World is coming. Can you tell me what Mieke is up to again? That means it's because of the nonsense of his old man. I'm going to take a shower. Yeah, and what's the problem? She doesn't want her new one to go out. It's clear what's behind it. She's jealous of her father's luck. Maybe she should look for someone else than Frederik. A little more action, you know? Hi, Mieke. Hi, Lena. Where's Frederik? There's time. I am your surprise egg. If you want, you can take me out. Yes, it's okay. I'll go already. Felix? Wait, I'll come with you. What's wrong? Are you crazy? Oh man, you're so stupid. The hottest girl in school is coming. And you? You're pulling the tail. You're so stupid. Andi isn't my type. I'm so bored. I don't know what to do. I don't think I know what it is. You're so stupid. She's got too much power. She's got too much sex. I don't like that. Take her if you like her so much. Then I should go to bed. I need a towel from you. Hey, man, I can show you one experiment. If you keep going like this, you'll die as a young man. Or are you suddenly no longer into fiber? Okay, one thing is clear. For a few days now, you only have glances for your pretty twin sister. So, if you didn't know that you're twin sisters, you could really mean that you're in love with each other. Mieke! Lie! Felix lies! Amelie, did you see Mieke? Hi, Frederik. She's in there. Saki, you should hurry, or we'll drive without you. Michaela? Where is Mathis? He has no boss. I wish that I could fly into the sky. Thanks for watching! I fly from the trees, over the seas, in all the grease, to anywhere I please. I wanna fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah Let's go and see the stars The Milky Way Or even Mars Where it could just be ours Let's wait until the sun Let your spirit fly The way I want Just for a little fun Oh, oh, oh yeah I want to get away I wanna fly away, yeah First you go to school, then you call because there is something urgent to discuss, and then you don't say a word. Are you kidding me? If you have a problem, you have to open your mouth. Maybe I just have my mouth full of this damn complicated life. In John, then he's completely gone. Gone with the shit? Hey, watch it! Who's got the problem? When I'm at home, there's a war going on, you know? My parents are still fighting. And if not, then they don't yell at me. I don't give a shit. To be continued... That was love. A very big love. There is no love. Love is just a rumor. You really have no idea. Tell me, man, could it be that you... Did you fall in love? Awesome, man, you fell in love. Hey, relax. Do as I do. Just go to a club. Ice cream, cinema, pizza or something with candlelight. Hey, come on. Hey, come on now, stop this shit. Mathis! Mathis! Mathis! Do you want to kill yourself or what? Mathis! Mathis! Mathis! So far away from the dancing cats, I love you so much. But that is quite far away. Hey, what are you doing? I want to go to Mathes. I found his popcorn. If you're lucky, he'll be in the bathtub. Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello. I found your wallet. At the lake. Some people say you're gay. Are you? If you want to make me happy. And what makes you happy? I don't know. Copyright WDR 2020 Like! Hello, my child. Hello, dad. Hello. This is a nice book. Yes. It's from dad's library. Can you get me a glass of water? I'll be right back. Thank you. And? How do you like her? Isn't she great? Are you happy with her? Yes, very. Mieke? You're the first one. Simona will have a child from me. You know what, Dad? I don't think I like her. Mathis? Do you have another one? But you have to know something like that. Sometimes you don't know anything anymore. You're kidding me. Mathis! Your father is having a baby! At least one person in the family is burning! What are you expecting from me? That I'll be left alone for the rest of my life? Nonsense. But you have to understand Mieke too. What she's doing is really a good tempo. You know, Simona is the first woman since Mom died, with whom I can imagine all of this again. With her and with you. Yes, she's really alright. I'm not saying anything against that. I love her. Only because you go to bed with her? Only because I go to bed with her. Sex and love are not necessarily the same. Many people don't notice that. Or only when it's too late. You can't do that. And not even in love. But... But if the others want such compromises from you... Mathis, you have to keep dreaming. Only you. Fuck the others. It's your life. Look, I've been left alone for years and only did my thing. I set up the workshop here. I wanted it to go well for me and you. And now also Simone. How can you be so sure that Simone is not a compromise? That you really love her? Because Simona is the first woman I can imagine getting old with. So, to stay with someone longer than 17 years. Yes. Like you and Mieke and me. That's love. I want to go out with Simone for three or four days. Do you think that's okay? Sure. I'll take care of Mieke. Bye! In our own car Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely, someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time at Rhyme and Verse and curse those faults. Rhyme and Verse Mattis. What is it? You're still dressed. I guess I have to go to sleep. Are you alright? Why Frederick? Why Lena? Is that why you took off the show with him? Why shouldn't I? The problem is... I mean, Frederick is really okay and I like him too, but... But you don't love him? I don't know. Are you in love with Lena? No. Did something happen with her? No. Neither with me and Frederik. I think he's pretty mad. I can't imagine that at all, you with a boyfriend and me with a girlfriend and us both. Then don't imagine it. Felix, what's going on? I can't stay at home anymore. I can kill my father. I can sleep now. That's so stupid. Everyone knows the other's words so well and goes into it so mercilessly. What a bitch. After three sentences, my mother and my father are already so far that he becomes an animal. He should finally leave his girlfriend and leave us alone. Say, do you want to drink something? But please no apple juice, okay? Hey, what's up with you? Come on, get out of here. You're my best friend. Yeah, sure. I am... I have... I'm in love. Yes, I know that now. And furthermore, somehow the point is missing. It's... I just don't know how to tell you. Come on, forget it. No, no, no. Come on, come on, come on. Am I just a best friend or not? Yes, you are. So come on, tell me. Is there something about Lena that's driving you crazy or what? It's not Lena. It's... It's Mieke. What? I'm in love with Mieke. Mathis, Mieke is your sister. Oh, I don't know. That can't be serious. You can't do that. And why not? Because you're an incisist, man! If you need someone to beat you up, then look for someone else! Shit, I don't get it. I can't get on my mother's back so easily. That's something completely different. Yes, sorry, for me it's the same. You see, that's exactly why I knew I couldn't tell you. Don't you think I'm not against it? I can't do anything for it. Yes. I know. I know you can't do anything for it. But the others don't know. Do you have a beer? Yes. Oh, God! Oh, shit! Hey, baby! Do you really know that this is our first time together? You bitch! And? How was I? You were like the first lukewarm rain that dripped down from dark branches. The weather is just as bad as ours. A potential father-murderer. And a potential sister-murderer. We are the real scum. Trash. Nonsense. Hey, man. Don't be crazy. You have to distract yourself. You can't always think about Nico and you, or you'll really provoke it. I have to go now. I have to go to the old taxi station. See you tonight, cutie. Hey, and do you like something? Tell me, Mieke, do you know that if you want something, you really want something, and you know it will never happen? Yes. Today we present... Yes? Did I promise you too much? What do we have here? Check out this DJ! Money men can win my love In sweet men's dance I'm stinking up We always hangin' up on the low stand I'm a ballin' time to dance You can love me but not your man I'll make you meet another legend So don't you get fresh with me oh You have a fever. Mieke. We're not allowed to. Just once. To be continued... Thank you for watching! Copyright WDR 2018 Copyright WDR 2021 Copyright WDR 2018 I think I'd rather never have left mommy's belly, than have always been in there with you. Forever and ever. Very soft and warm. Little Mieke. No. I'm not that small anymore. Everything used to be much more complicated. Nobody bothered us when we were toiling around together. But today it's all a problem. Only if we do it. You are my sister. And your girlfriend. Yes. Which I can't tell anyone. And what do you do when someone asks if you have a girlfriend? Then I say no. But you would lie. That's not true. Why? What am I to you then? My sister, of course. Close your eyes again. Just tell me if you think I'm on one side. I don't know. Stop. See? Things aren't that clear anymore. We're not allowed to do that anymore. That's... Shh. Maybe it's just a dream. It has to stop, Mieke. Every dream stops at some point. Why? Because it's a forbidden happiness. 因為它是禁止的幸運。 Why do we need a permit for happiness? 為什麼我們需要幸福? Who do we hurt with our love? 誰受傷了? Who do we hurt? 誰受傷了? Maybe ourselves. 可能我們自己。 Don't do it! Are you scared? Do you really think the day could change anything about our lives? Good morning, Ike. We're back. Without you, it would be too boring. Let's all have breakfast together. I'm going to the market. Oh, I'll do that. Good morning, Dad. Good morning, my child. Let's go. Hello? Why don't you give Simone a chance? Because she pushed herself in here. And because she thinks of you as a child, Dad. There are always two to that, Mieke. I wanted it that way. But you have children. Aren't we enough for you? Mieke, you know yourself that you're talking nonsense. I want you to give Simone a chance. Promise me that, please. Then we'll be a real family again. When she comes in, it's over with us. Ahí Good morning. Good morning. May I introduce Catherine Krüger? She came to us with her family from Vienna. Maybe you should sit over there. Good morning. Here, Mathis already has a five. Talk to him again. You're practically part of the family now. Maybe he's got the wrong approach. There's a rumor, but be careful, that his friend Felix Beck is cheating. I really don't understand all these idiots anymore. Come on, let's go. We'll never see each other again. What if we do? Come on. Hey, you two cuties! Are the two of you together? Okay, that's really great. Listen, we'll try something else. You go a little closer and kiss each other on the mouth, okay? Like two lovers. Good. Yes. Nice. You'll never tell me that my son is addicted to drugs. Maybe he's just in love. With whom? I don't know. Maybe with his sister? You did it, didn't you? You slept with your sister. I hope you know what happens when it comes out. And what about Mathis? When we came home and he only came out of his room with jeans? My God, Simone, they are twins, and that's not until today. Yes, that's clear to me. I know you don't want to hear it, but the behavior of the two of them seems strange to me. When Mieke ran out and I called away Mathis, even though he was in his room, that doesn't fit together. Maybe it's just embarrassing for him because you're there and sniffing around everywhere. Sniffing around? Okay, if that's the case. That's not what I meant. Then what? Why don't you want to see it? It's your children. Soon yours too. In a certain way. In a certain way. You told him. He knows. You told him that we... No, I didn't! And why are you sitting there so stupidly? You can tell me what you want. He knows what. Who did you have to hug at school? We hugged Felix a thousand times that evening. You must have told him something. And if that were the case, what would be so bad about it? One day, when he needs money for his drugs, he'll break us. Mieke, Felix is my friend. Felix! Come on! Felix, don't do anything stupid! Felix, come out! Felix! My horns! Come on! Do you want an omelette? I hate omelettes. Jan? Yes, I'm going to talk to him. Shit, you almost got drunk. Let go of your damn drugs! I don't take drugs. No, you don't take drugs. You don't smoke joints. And what about all those fucking pills, huh? These are painkillers. Next time I have to go into a strange tube. You'd think I have a tumor. Here. Up here. But why didn't you tell me? I just wanted to be cool. Not the stupid epileptic. When do you have to go to the clinic? Tomorrow. Okay. You know what's the worst? I never slept with a woman. When The Hey, maybe I can arrange something with you and him. Don't worry, Casanova. My women can tear me apart. Thank you. I have to go. Hey, Felix. If I can do something for you... I'm not crying, okay? Besides, whether you believe me or not. At the moment I'm more worried about you. At the moment I'm more worried about you. Sometimes you feel quite alone in this world. What makes you think that? I have eyes in my head. And? What do you see with your eyes? That you're not feeling well. What do you mean, not feeling well? That's maybe just a bit much at the moment. Your siblings? Siblings. My father got married again after my mother died. I know that from somewhere. My mother has been dead for 16 years. She died shortly after we were born. The older I get, the less I can start with her. I didn't even know her. To know people, you don't have to see them. Close your eyes. God, I don't know if he takes drugs. Welcome to the Kreuzweiler. Dad and his great new friends have a question for you. Hello, Katrin. Hello, Michaela. Good evening. This is my father. Mrs. Sien, you know her. This is Katrin. Hello. Hi, Katrin. I think I have to go. No, no, stay. No, it's late anyway. I think it's big. Bye then. Bye, Mathis. Bye, Katrin. Bye. We just talked about it with Mieke... Michaela! My name is Michaela! He calls me Mieke, he's allowed to call me Mieke, but not you! Mieke! Sorry, Michaela. We just talked about your friend Felix with Michaela. And the rumour that he's taking drugs. Is there something to it? Drugs? Felix doesn't take drugs. Felix has a brain tumor! He's cursed with painkillers! I'm sorry to disappoint you! God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean what I said about Felix. Can I talk to you? I wanted to ask you what you were doing this morning. I had two cards for your burger, Ted. I already had something planned. Tell me, what did I do to you? I mean, first you took me to you and then suddenly you're totally out of it. That has nothing to do with you, Frederik. Oh yeah? You think I don't realize what's going on here? So how do you mean that? You don't understand me. And you know what? Your kind of shit doesn't bother me either. Well, Krise? I know a cute little hotel with a cute little whirlpool. We should both go there together. The water is too cold for me. Matthias! Please bring me the card. Bye! I'm beautiful, Mathis. Why don't you kiss me? Why don't you want to sleep with me? Come on, Mathis. Stop it, I can't do that. Because you're screwing your sister. Mathis? Are you all right? I'm fine. Something's not right. I have to take Felix to the hospital now, I promised him. Something like that doesn't build up straight. Life is pretty shitty sometimes. But it can also be quite nice, you should never forget that. The only way we can help Felix at the moment is to give him a thumbs up. I'm always there for you. Thank you. You're going to the city? Yes. I don't know how to tell you, but there are strange rumors in the school. They talk about brothers and sisters, but who wants to be the bad witch? What's wrong? Forget it. You know something or you don't know anything? I don't want to say anything. Please get out. I want you to get out. Hurry! Thank you buddy! Should I come in with you? No, leave it. Tell me, aren't you scared at all? I'm fucking scared. They're cutting my head off. I don't care. Maybe there's another way. They're not even sure, are they? Maybe I'm not scared yet. I can play your protection, too. It could be broken. You're real to me. Okay, then... Take care. Come on, don't make that face. Smile. That's better. Oh, I almost forgot. Here. So Lena can finally leave you alone. I took a picture of her with the clown. Yeah, I have to go. Bye. Bye. Bye. Copyright WDR 2021 Copyright WDR 2021 Mathis! And? How is Felix? He has built me up instead of him. Can you imagine something like that? Oh, Mathis. I have the feeling that everything is falling apart about me. Hey, you can't say that. It's not true. You know just as well as I do that it's true. Sometimes I wish for what I'm most afraid of. For everything to be over. We have no chance at all. Then we have nothing to lose. Hello, Mathis. Hi, Katrin. I wanted to bring your book back. And then I wanted to go to church with you. Hello, Michaela. Hello, Katrin. I want to take your brother away from you. Actually, I promised Mieke that... Go ahead. ♪♪ Thank you for watching! Copyright WDR 2018 Look, Mieke, what I've found in the storage room. You've learned to walk with them. You put yourself on your thin little legs and ran off. You were determined and sure. You couldn't stop. My little child, what's wrong with you lately? I'm not happy, Dad. If you don't talk to me, I can't help you. How am I supposed to talk about something I can't talk about? You mean you can't talk about feelings. Sometimes you don't even know if they're right or wrong. Everything that makes you happy, small, is right. And what makes others happy? Does it make you so unhappy that I love Simona? Simona, Simona, only Simona! Leave me alone with your shitty Simona! We had agreed that you would give her a chance. Why not? Listen to me, my poor child. I gave you your wreaths against the resistance of all grandmothers in the world. And your snuff for five. I bought you a piano and your first lipstick. I love eating white beans for your birthday. And? Do you know me better, Papa? I can imagine that for children it's not one of the most pleasant ideas that their father sleeps with a woman. But if you love each other, then you want to go to bed together. Everything belongs to love, even a child. Dad, it's not about Simona and you, it's about Mati and me. Bye. You feel left behind. The world doesn't work because two people love each other. What do you know, Dad? No matter what happens, my love for you and Mathis never stops. You made me a father, you are my children and it will always stay that way. Even if you have children of your own. Promised? Yes. Good night! If children are small, they still have very small worries. The bigger they get, the bigger our worries will be. If only I knew what's going on with Mieke lately. I can tell you that. She's going to be a young woman. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The photographer made it for us. And? There's more of it. Don't be ridiculous. The boy is 16. 17. And he likes to take pictures. He needs models to envy him for taking his sister. It's not Helmut Newton. It's not his fault. I'm sorry, but it's all because of the hair. It's not because of the hair. It's just another part of the puzzle. What about Katrin? Why is my son walking around with a beautiful girl? Holding hands when he's with his sister? Oh, no. Leave it. I'll do it myself. Why don't you want to see it? No one will like you with it. With your cooking skills, no one will like you. It's going to be a great party. You won't impress the teacher either. Too bad, too bad. It won't be anything with the big career. Where's my tie? It's all over. Who would have thought that I would invite him as a teacher to my house for dinner? The Höfflers are totally nice. I am convinced of that. Very nice staff. Sleep with me. Hey, don't forget that you'll get a child from a civil servant. Yes, a terrible thought, a civil servant's child. Especially considering that the father is chaotic. Yes, yes, don't worry. As far as education is concerned, I've got everything under control. Think of my twins. Bye. Oh shit, the wine didn't cool down. I told Mathis half an hour ago, he just doesn't show up. Where are they? Wait, I'll do it! It's so nice that you came. May I? Thank you. Jan, are you coming, please? I'll be right in. Jan! May I introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Höfler? Well, then. My future husband, Mr. Dauberg. Nice to meet you. Yes, then let's go inside. I've been looking for a beautiful evening gas. We've got a commode from the 17th century. Oh, I forgot something. Sorry. You were right. How could I have been so blind? What happened? Mathis is sleeping with his sister. The two of them are in bed upstairs. Jan... What am I supposed to do now? I can't just go up there and tear it out of my bed and blow it up. That wouldn't change anything in this situation. Yes, unfortunately. It's too late. Why didn't I want to have it before? I can't just go back in there and pretend it's nothing. What will you do instead? Send the Hufflers home and tell them why? Dad. Put your shirt on properly. Dad. For the first time in my life I really want to hit someone. Papa, please. Get out of my sight. She likes to eat. She doesn't cook, honey. If we have guests, take a look at Fanko's Paus. Where are your legs? I had hoped to get a My husband loves you We're leaving. What? This is our only chance. Mieke, I don't know. We don't have a future. Do we even have one? Go ahead. Bye. Lomberg? Hello, Mr. Lomberg. This is Felix. Can I speak to Matt? I have just received the message of my life and there is no black hole in it. You can treat my tumour with the comatose. Can you imagine that?

There's nothing left to talk about. Mieke, leave it. I know that he loves you. And if that would be possible, believe me, I would accept it. And why don't you do it? You said yourself that you should do what makes you happy. Leave us alone. Please just let us go, Dad. Where are you going? You can run away from me and Simona. But you can't run away from it yourself. We just want to be happy. I don't want anything else for you. But if I don't forbid you from loving each other, others will do it. We don't stand a chance, do we? Yes, we do. One chance remains. The first picture of your sister. I still can't imagine that dad and you will see this. I love him very much. I don't want to take him away from you. I know. I think I know how to love someone. Can I keep this? This is for you. Thank you. Thank you. Copyright WDR 2021 I feel like I'm bleeding inside.
