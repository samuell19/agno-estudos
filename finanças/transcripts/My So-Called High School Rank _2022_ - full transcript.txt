That inequity played a huge role in us writing "Ranked." (cheering and applause) Sid, I can't get ahold of mom and dad. Lex isn't returning my calls. Where have you been? Kyle: There's a character in our story whose main plot line is his parents were paying for his grades without him knowing. In our early read-throughs from our friends, a lot of the feedback was, "Eh, seems like a bit of a stretch. How could he not know and how could he--" And we just felt really adamant, we have to leave this in. We think this is really important, you're not going to talk us out of this. And then the story broke. reporter: The largest ever college admissions cheating scam. Fifty people arrested. Most of them wealthy parents, all accused of trying to do the same thing: getting their kids into some of the most elite schools in the country. woman: Rick Singer, years ago, he actually worked with students at Granite Bay High School. He ran an office here. A lot of our students used to work with him. reporter: We had a pretty strange case of life imitating art, a show that explored life in high school, one often driven by grades, tests, and this immense pressure to get into top colleges. David: Oh, we're really onto something. Everyone is waiting to talk about this, and now they get to. And see a musical. (chuckles) Ryan, have you been paying for your grades or not? -Ryan: Lex, look, I can explain. -student: You were the one paying for your class rank. What are we supposed to tell colleges? That we don't have ranks anymore because you cheated? Look at yourselves, tearing each other apart, over what, a number? (murmuring) Kyle: Holy shit. That's our story. I wrote that a year ago.

(dramatic piano chords playing) Kyle: Okay! Lots of work to do. David: Here we go. Kyle: At a school like Granite Bay, everyone kind of knows where everyone is, rank-wise, all the time. They can log in on an app and see what their grades are. They can see how their rank changes. Technology has made it so accessible and so prevalent in their lives. Kids are oftentimes finding themselves very miserable, and very unhappy. Jack: There's a huge pressure. Everyone's like, "I need to get an A in this class." "I need to keep up my 4.5 GPA while balancing drama and being on a sports team and the National Honor Society." Anvita: My parents and I have butt heads so many times. They tell me like if you like theater, that's great, but your AP scores need to be in check first, and your SATs need to be in check first. (crowd applauding on video) Kyle: We had a student a few years ago give the valedictorian speech and talk about how they just played a game. 4.63. This three-digit number is the reason I stand before you today. GPA has become like currency in a game of Monopoly, in which the players who chance upon the right tiles or construct the right schedules earn more, while others inevitably end up with less. No matter what, someone wins the game, while the rest stand defeated. Kyle: It went viral. I think over six million views on YouTube. It's pretty indicative of the culture. Right when you're trying to figure out who you are, the school, and your peers, and your teachers, and sometimes even your parents, will come to you and say, "Here's what you are, you're this number." And it is so easy to just take that number, because it's so much easier than trying to acknowledge the fact that you don't know who you are. Kyle: In June of 2018, we sat down with our students. We said, "Tell us everything that is going on in your life that you've not said to your parent." In writing the musical "Ranked," we wanted to amplify everything our students were saying to us.

Yeah, we don't use Twitter for anything else. Anastasia: People see success here as getting a job in computer science or bioengineering. (laughing) Everything that has math in it. It's a math city. Like, we have an Apple campus right there. Kami Tomberlain: Cupertino is definitely suburban Silicon Valley. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest. Everybody's here, one form or another. Arcadia Conrad: It is a community made up of first- and second-generation immigrants, most of whom are united by the desire to see their children do very, very well in life. So, a lot of people move here for the schools. teacher: Growing up in Silicon Valley, is that forming your identity? student: Everyone is out to, like, be their very best and to get that perfect 1600 or that perfect score. teacher: Do you imagine we're a little skewed into what "pass" is? You could all pass this class with a C. Wouldn't that feel fine? (nervous laughter) Senih: In Cupertino, like, almost everyone's parents did amazing in their countries that they immigrated from. You have all these parents who were top of their class telling their kids, "Why can't you be the top of your class?" But there's only one top of class. Arcadia: All righty datty dooly.

I wanna leave a mark. But I've been working for past two years, and so many people coming from Apple to get their coffee and then they're talking about work. I'm just thinking, is that, like, what I'm supposed to do? Thinking about doing theater as a profession, it gives me just a hope. But I always have this concern, is it possible?

Senih: I feel like I'm trying as hard as I can, but my dad would disagree. My dad would be like, "Oh, you're not really trying as hard as you can. If you were, you know, you'd be doing better." So, why were you this late, though? I told you, like, if you come in earlier, like three or four. I had to take the SAT. Oh, that's right. How did it go? (Senih sighs) Like, you know, you'd think after doing it four times, you'd improve. Yeah. And then you don't improve. And it's just a waste of time.

I wouldn't-- okay, but I wouldn't say no progress. Like I still... (sighs) What makes you think you made progress? Just, I don't like hearing "no progress." Well, I know you don't like it, but that's the truth, right? Senih: My dad immigrated from Turkey. He was really lucky, you know, one of the brightest people. He went to the best college, got a job here. He really holds us to this high standard, like, "Why can't you just get all As? Why can't you just be a good student?" And I, I just wish there was a way to tell him that it's not as easy as he thinks it is. I don't think my dad realizes how much his approval means to me. My older brother plays football, and, you know, my dad always goes to his games. I don't think he really notices that he doesn't reciprocate the same feelings for when I do theater. I can invite 80, 90 friends to a musical and have them all tell me I did great, but it's not going to be the same as if my dad just for a second was like, "Hey, that was pretty good." That would mean so much more to me.

Chris Hickey: The issue of suicide and self-injury comes up in my office every single day.

But we're in West Virginia. There's, like, no schools that have the arts. I think about, would I be successful going to, like, a big city trying to do something? I definitely feel like I'm stereotyped because I'm from West Virginia. Like, people just assume that everyone's just like country hicks and that we don't know anything. But I also can't overthink that 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen. (quirky music playing) Christina: So we're gonna spend a little time looking at what our characters actually want.

So, they definitely put their grades over, you know, Ryan. -Christina: The friendship. Right. -Yeah. I am aware of class rank, but... I don't care about it.

But I'm wanting to go to this other college because I, I feel like I would be the only person to stay home. You know, all of my friends, they're going off to these schools, some of them even like out of the state. So if I were to stay home and in Ripley, I would feel stuck. (pensive music playing) Evan: The idea of not leaving West Virginia, it's very deeply seated. I mean, the hills, um, in the first place, when there weren't, like, good roads, it was physically difficult to leave this place. And then, the state isn't doing well economically. Nor is it doing well with our good old drug epidemic, so... it's difficult for a lot of people to leave for a lot of different reasons. You can't do much in creativity here. I mean you can't do anything except fast food, retail, and working at a plant. But if you can leave West Virginia, which I'd say about 5% of the people who live here do, uh, there are jobs out there, and I just don't think teachers expect us to leave the state.

I've never cried in the room. -David: You're getting soft. -It's just so potent. They're so young, and... That's true! We're getting very, very young. -Yeah. -And it's just so unfettered. Kyle: Mm-hmm. -That's what we need though. -Yeah. David: This has been my dream for my whole life, to have a musical produced in New York. It's starting to happen and that feels really, really cool. (soft string music playing) (music fades) (distant siren wailing) (indistinct chatter) -(laughter) -student: Me too. My life with a Clorox wipe. Kami: Last week, we got word from the county public health department that they were recommending some pretty restrictive changes to how schools were operating. It's unprecedented in our lifetime, what's happening right now. There have been other contagions. They have not spread this quickly to as many places on the planet. We are scheduled for six live performances and none of those are gonna happen. We are hoping to do one show that is filmed, so that the kids get to perform it on stage, but that instead of an audience, we have a video camera. woman: Why not just cancel the play? Why put it on for no audience? Well, because of the kids. You don't just cancel a play. That's, like, unthinkable. Theater has existed in, like, the worst places all over the world. It existed during the plague and it exists in refugee camps. It existed in concentration camps. It exists. It's the... the deck chairs on the Titanic, you're just gonna, just gonna to do it... until you can't, you know. Kami: (over loudspeaker) Good morning, Cupertino. This is Ms. Tomberlain. I'm sorry to interrupt class. I want you to know this is not an emergency. Beginning Monday, Cupertino High School will be closed in response to the COVID-19 virus. So, right now, we're looking at three weeks, schools closed, online education. Um, we want to keep everybody safe and everybody healthy. Thank you very much, and I will be sending out more information shortly. -Hi. -student: Hello. This is the day we didn't want to have to have. Um... I think that Megan and I would like to go over to the theater so that we can all put our show into a state of suspended animation. (somber music playing) Every time I get to spend time in a circle like this, I realize how lucky I am. We were lucky to have been here, we were lucky to have cared. So... we don't know what's gonna happen now. Except for the next thing we're gonna do is clap and we'll jump, and something will happen then. One, two, three. That's settled. Christina: Obviously, we need to talk about, um, things getting shut down on us today. Okay? So first we got the announcement that it was just after-school activities that would be closed until April 10th, which was the weekend we were going to perform. Um, and then it came that the governor totally shut down schools for the state. -So, let's hope this gets over within a month. -I really hope so. Christina: I'm hoping we're back after spring break, but I'm also not holding my breath. Evan: This feels pretty damn real. The school's closing down, and I don't know when it's coming back. Everything else is closing too. It's crazy. It's crazy right now. Jane: I'm disappointed that the musical got canceled because that's like, that's my moment where I shine. It's like the sports kids, they don't get to finish their season, they don't get to be like the senior all-star athlete. This is as close as we come to being an all-star athlete. Kyle: David and I were having conversations with each other about the coronavirus, really wondering, are we gonna be able to get to New York and do our reading and get out before this happens? Two days before we were supposed to get on a plane to New York, the NBA season cancels. reporter: ...concerns have prompted the NBA to scrap its entire remaining season. Kyle: We wake up Thursday morning, and that's when Broadway closes. reporter: At 5 p.m. Thursday, Broadway officially went dark. Kyle: Broadway was closing for the first time since September 11th. David: It was an "oh shit" moment, where your stomach sort of turns over a little bit, and everyone felt that in the entire world. Um, we were just two more people who felt that.

I believe it's day... day 12 or... 12, I think, of, of quarantine. This is the first time I've ever had to do any form of online school. And it feels weird. Okay, I have not gone outside ever in these two weeks. I haven't even stepped foot outside my door. Not this door, like outside my front door. Ojas: It's day 36 of quarantine. I'm noticing that I'm sort of forgetting how to have a conversation with other humans. Could be a Tuesday, could be a Wednesday. I'm pretty sure neither of those are correct though. I think, and I hope that this will be over in a month or two, maybe? I've heard that we're not getting, like, a vaccine for a year. God, that sounds terrible. Senih: My sleep schedule is now completely flipped. I will sleep at around 4 a.m., and I'll wake up at around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. It's not very healthy for me. We found out that someone just down the road was positive for the virus. And that's very unnerving. Of course I can Facetime my friends, but it's not, it's not the same, and... I don't think it's really good for anyone's mental health. Purvi: I'm feeling really confused and just sort of disoriented, and I'm not really sure what to do at the moment. Barbara: I'm really uncertain with how my grades are gonna turn out and how that's gonna affect my college admissions and which college I choose. I don't think I can do this for another five weeks. (laughs) I'll try, I have to, but... It's boring, dude. It sucks. I hate it. I want to go back to school. Kyle: Theaters aren't meant to be empty. There's 500 seats here. Like, people are supposed to be in them. Christina: For a lot of kids, theater is where they find the place where they belong. The arts is what's getting cut out. You really can't do theater very well with a mask on your face. Arcadia: There really hasn't been a time in my life where I haven't been backstage, on stage, around stage. Not knowing what it's going to look like to move forward is the part that is the hardest. What the fuck do we do now? Even if this dies down over summer and we get all of our ducks in a row and we're back in New York in July because we can be, is there even gonna be a market for theater then? David: After the descent into despair, the Broadway dream being on pause... brought us back to why we wrote the show in the first place. We wrote the show for the students.

It's just so special to us that students get to be the ones to bring "Ranked" to New York for its debut. We're just so appreciative that y'all are able to give this some New York life. (string quartet playing) Linda Key: In the Bronx, many students are just hungry, hungry to succeed. A lot of the kids come from single-parent homes. We have students who might have to stay at home to take care of siblings because both parents are working. The reality for a lot of my kids is they're in a smaller apartment with lots of family members. Many of their parents are working triple shifts. College represents a way for them to raise their economic state. I mean, that's a huge thing. For our communities, education is your... your key to success. Something that we're constantly communicating to students is what it means to be above average. Like, if you want to get into the top school, you have to be above average. Welcome to today's episode of the "Average Update." We're coming to you live with a new-- Ooh, with a special. I'm Nate Huge! Or like, a little... I'm Nate Huge!

(horn honks) No hate in my holler! No hate in my holler! No hate in my holler! Leo: The objective of today is kind of just to educate and inform people. Because, I mean, this is Ripley. Like, it's a white prominent town. So you have a lot of people saying, "all lives matter," and things that are really racist. Being in a small town is no excuse for ignorance. man: We do have several armed counter-demonstrators with signs saying they're backing the blue. woman: We see a lot of second amendment folks here. And they're saying they're here to keep it peaceful. Now, what do you make of that? Do you think that that's their intentions? What's going on? I think it's an intimidation factor. I think they're trying, yeah... I think they're trying to, ya know, make us go away. So you're, you're telling me that Black lives matter. Okay, I agree with you. Do not all lives matter? -Okay, so... -Do not all lives matter? Leo: Can I explain it? So yeah, all lives do matter. But the thing is that Black lives are, they're going through a racial injustice within this country right now, and we're trying to bring attention to their lives. -Okay, wow. -(woman speaking): -No. -Please? You're really close to me. man: Okay, that's good. Did I offend you?

Leo: And she didn't ask him to back off. Taylor: It honestly really made me upset that you have a bunch of middle-aged white men walking down the street with, you know, AR-15s on their backs to try to scare these kids, you know, protesting for something that actually means something.

We just took everything another bunch of steps. Jolimar: I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. I moved to New York at the age of 9. My mom thought that in New York City we were able to seek a better life, a better future. I made a vow to myself when I came here, I was like, when I finally learn English, I'll make sure that I'm the best student that I can. Maybe not get like Salutatorian and, and Valedictorian. But maybe the best student as I can. I've always wanted to go to college, but being able to pay for college is a big factor into my college application process. Not being able to pay for the college of your dreams, it breaks your heart. You have the potential, but just because you can't afford it, you're not able to go, and somebody else can because they are, and it's kind of unfair, but that's just the way the world is. I live with my mom and my sister. I used to live with my aunts and uncles and cousins in the same apartment. You know, you come from the bottom and have to work your way up. My mom, she has done so much for us in order to have what we have now. The most important for me is my daughters. (speaking Spanish) Oooh, five more minutes. I'm nervous! I always wanted to go to college to pursue my dream as an actor. Also, like, learn other skills. Like, be a entrepreneur. It would really mean a lot. My mom, she didn't have the chance to go, my brother didn't get a chance to go, so being that I'm getting a chance to go, I want to take advantage of this opportunity. There've been things in my life that pushed me back and made me feel like I couldn't do it, but like getting there and going to college would just make me feel like I could do anything. (computer chimes) Hello. Well, welcome to the audition, sir. Um, thank you, first of all, for auditioning for us. So, what monologues will you be doing for me today, Mr. Sampson? Today, I will be performing Twilight from the play "Twilight: Los Angeles 1992." So, a lot of the times when I brought up the idea to my homeboys, they say, "Twilight. That's before your time, that's something you can't do now." When I talked about the truce back in 1988, that was something they'd consider before it's time. Yet in 1992, we made it realistic. So, to me it's like I'm stuck in a limbo, like the sun is stuck between night and day in the twilight hours, you know? You're nervous, aren't you? Just a little bit. 'Cause your energy right now is sort of like "Ahhh!" and you do not need to be. I want you to sort of... "I'm gonna own it. I'm gonna own everything..." Isiah: I know, like, this college application process is competitive and, just, financially, I'm just scared I will have to go with probably my second choice or my third choice, just being that I wouldn't be able to afford my top choice. Your little skinny self should have went over there. Michqwelyn: Isiah is the driven one, like, he has that drive, that ambition. Like, he just, he goes for it. And this acting career that he is going after, he really wants it. Like a whole other time, it was a major disaster. When I brought up the ideas to my homeboys, they say, "Twilight..." Oft, I have picked up dead men from the grave and set them upright at their dead friend's door. -I felt that. That was dope. -Isiah: Thank you. -Zay, why do you have so many tabs open? -Dope. 'Cause I'm applying to college right now. Michqwelyn: I want them to have a better life than me. Not saying my life is bad, but I just want them to be... don't have to struggle, like, it's, it's hard out here. So I just want them to... be what they want to be when they grow up. Isiah's like his dad. When he wants something, he goes for it. And he won't stop until he gets it. Isiah has that drive, just like Rob. That's how Rob was. Isiah: My dad, he passed away freshman year. I lost myself, in a way. It set me back a lot, like with grades. But I realized that he would want me to pursue my dream as an actor. Now, I'm in the National Honor Society. My grades is good, I'm doing good in all my classes. I'm on top of my stuff. I know he's probably looking down at me right now, in this moment, and like, he's probably proud of me, and I just want to continue to make him proud. This is, like, my good luck charm. Um, it's hung over my bed right now, um... I don't know, I'm gettin' emotional right now. I actually kiss up to my dad every night, um... Just knowing that he's not here and he can't like, really, like, experience the things that I'm experiencing, be proud of me, be happy for his son, tell his son that... he loves him. And even me telling my dad that I love him. It just hurts me every day. So, I'm gonna make sure that, um... I might give back in a way, um, you know. Everything he gave to me, I'm gonna give back, I promise. One, two, ready, play! (drums beating) -(cheering) -(whistle blows) announcer: It's the pride of Jackson County, the Ripley High School Fighting Marching Band! -(bells clanging) -(students cheering) Leo: Our first football game, even with like COVID and everything. Tonight is senior night. They'll be calling my name out. announcer: Band member for eight years and has plans to major in animation in college. (applause) Leo: My mom is in Tennessee, so I've been living alone here in Ripley. My stepdad got a job down there so she goes back to Tennessee like every other week. And she knows that I'm fine up here. I do everything. I do all the cleaning. I do all the cooking and the laundry and all that. Like, I feel like I'm already ready to be living on my own. I've been applying to a couple different schools. And a lot of this stuff is, like, money. It's just like... whether or not I can get in is a whole other thing, but like, even if I do get in, can I pay for it? I applied for so many scholarships already. I mean, I've heard nothing back. A lot of these scholarships, it's like you have to be like super, super smart. You have to be making like a 4.0, maybe like more. I'm trying to save up for college. The American Dream, like, it's the idea that if you work hard enough, you can get a good education, you can get a good job. I mean, obviously, that's just like not always true. At this point, it's like, can I get into these colleges and can I pay for it? So that's kinda like what I'm worried about right now. Maisie, up! Right now life is a lot slower than what I'd like it to be. I'm going to West Virginia University at Parkersburg and my major is Business Administration. It's been weird transitioning from high school to college without being in college. Constant surveillance to literally none, not even like a classroom to have a teacher, like, look me in the eyes and tell me what to do. I am feeling isolated right now. I did buy a ring light for college. Most people would think, "Oh, you bought it so the lighting is better so maybe the teacher can see you." No, there's a cute girl in my business class, and I wanted to look good for her on the Zoom meeting! Hello. I think students are coming to their senses about how much college is really worth versus how much you're spending on it. A more basic college degree, it's getting you the same education, but you're saving tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt down the road. (dog barking) Anne: With the virus going on, I'm not sure how, like, my future plans are gonna work out. It's kinda nerve-wracking. I decided I didn't want to be a teacher. And I really think the virus has a big thing to play with that. I'm not sure I would be strong enough to do that for years. I've really been thinking about special effects more. I've been practicing a little bit. I looked up special effects schools, and I realized, maybe I can do the arts. How in the world did you go from, "I wanna teach little kids and help them grow" to, "I want to, um, make people look like they've been in a car accident"? I feel like teaching is more like a hardcore job, kinda like your basic job that you hear about, like the lawyers, doctors. I feel like teaching kind of goes into that category, and I don't want to be normal. I can't let the virus stop me from really becoming who I wanna become. I still have to live my dreams. And if it doesn't work out, that's okay, it was fun! It's better to say, "Hey, I almost became a special effects artist" than say I didn't try. (distant siren wailing) -Linda: Ba, ba, ba. -Jolimar: Ba, ba, ba. -Pa, pa, pa. -Pa, pa, pa. I started acting when I was in middle school. Ms. Key has pushed me into being the best actress, creative artist as I can. I really want to become professional. Let's go through what's coming up for you in terms of your auditions. Jolimar: I'm applying to like 13 schools in total. I don't have a dream school. I don't really want to get attached to one and get sad because I didn't get in. teacher: Hi, Jolimar! Bernard Cummings: Hi, Jolimar! Thank you so much for auditioning for us. Um, we know what a really strange and crazy process this is. The stage is all yours. Yes. You promised me my life, but you lied. And by your wanting to take them away from me or from any human creature, I know that your counsel is of the devil and that mine is of God! You took on "Saint Joan" by Shaw. And you personalized it and made it your own, which is something that I love about it. I want you to do the whole "Saint Joan" in Spanish. Okay. (laughs) Let's say you are an immigrant. You're down here at the Texas border. They've yanked your child from you. You're in a cage. Some right-wing politician comes and wants to look through the cage and ask you how you feel. (in Spanish) Thank you. Wow, I'm sorry, you got me emotional with that monologue. There's a real energy out of you, and it, it's just absolutely wonderful. So walk into any and every audition you have coming up with great confidence. -Bye, thank you so much! -Bye. (shrieks) I don't know how to feel! ♪ I've always been the good little sister ♪ (laughs) ♪ Just keep my lips on lock ♪ ♪ Don't take the chance to talk ♪ Oh, my gosh, that was the audition of my life, ah! Wow. Okay. Senih: I got a job, started making money. Got a car, all that fun stuff. I guess I was very scared of the idea that I would just stay home and do nothing and be completely satisfied with that. -Hey, how're you guys doing? -Hi, good. How are you? -Senih: Good, good. -Thank you. There you go. And I'll give you that. -I'll be right back with some water for you guys. -That'd be great. Senih: I do expect more out of me now than I would a year ago. I know myself better than I did, and I think that kind of motivates me to do more. I've been able to kind of be my own person. Because of my grades, I didn't feel like I was in a position where I got to really be too picky with where I went to college. ...and the basic burger is pretty big. I applied to a bunch of different schools. I'm planning on going as far away as I can from home, you know, New York, hopefully. I've never really lived outside of my parents' sphere of influence, so it's gonna be nice to make my own choices. You know, the opportunity to learn how to live by myself. That's what I think of when I think of college. Where is it? Sign in, there we go. Okay. Oh, this is scary! Ah! Okay, three, two, one... (perky music playing) Holy... Okay, so I got waitlisted. -Waiting list isn't bad. -Yeah. -It's not a rejection. -Okay. I got rejected. It's... it's pretty disappointing. "I wish that a different decision had been possible." Do you, Harvard? Do you really? Because if you wish it, you would have done it. (laughs) -Oh, no. -Oh, my God. Ah, I got in! (shrieking) mother: You have been accepted! Whoo! Let's go! I'm officially an Illini now, so that's exciting. (mother speaking Japanese) That's such a relief. It's my first college. Worst case, I got into college! Aaaah! We almost in, y'all. We at the finish line. We almost did it, so... I am so excited. I've been accepted to one of the schools that I really want to go to. Congratulations! I got a $100,000 scholarship. Michael Johnson: Today is college decision day. We come together to celebrate them, to encourage them, and to just acknowledge all of the hard work that our seniors have achieved and the challenges that they've overcome this academic year. Today marks an extremely significant day for each of you. Today is the day you decide how you will spend the next two to four years of your life as you pursue post-secondary education. Linda: Many of our seniors have gotten into their first choice school, some are waiting for a few more decisions. The students are going to have to see what the financial aid packages are. For our students, it's not a possibility to come out of school with a $200,000 student loan. That would be sort of crippling if they were going into the arts as a career. They need to find the best option to enter the career path of their choice with very little debt. Isiah: A lot of my friends are on urge of making their decisions already. Some already made their decision. It just kind of make me like, "Dang, I wish I knew where I was going." I heard back from Howard University and Chapman University in California. I got into Chapman, but I got waitlisted for Howard. Being told no, ya know, it just, like, it's messing with my, like, my whole plan of where I wanna go to college. I'm really stuck in the middle right now. I don't have all the answers, you know, to financial aid. Just this week me and my mom had been talking. She was just saying that she don't want me in debt. I'm young and she doesn't want all that on me at a young age. She doesn't want it to mess me up in the future. At the end of the day it's my decision, and honestly for my dream, I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind being in debt, and that's what I told my mom. I told my mom everything can go in my name. "I don't want nothing-- I don't want nothing on you. I want everything on me because it's my dream, it's my life, and I should be taking accountability for what I want." Linda: All of us in the arts department are committed to our students living their dreams, so, like, we'll exhaust every possibility to help them find the money. -Whoo! -Whoo! -Linda: Wait, wait, wait! -Isiah: Can't forget you! both: Whoo! Whoo! -Isiah: You know that! -Linda: All right, man. Linda: Last time we talked, we talked a lot about Howard. But as luck will have it, you seem like you have another choice... -Isiah: Yes. -...that has come to you. My other choice is Chapman University in California. -Linda: Great. -For screen acting, so... You got their financial aid package back. So, what they gave me, approximately 57,000, and then the rest I'll have to like, it's 18. -Linda: 18,000 per year. -18,000, you know. (tearfully) We're really proud of you. Don't cry, miss. What you about to tell me? Linda: We love you, and we know your dream. And we've got really good news. You got a scholarship, so you don't have to pay the 18,000. Nah, you're serious? Yeah. I don't... I'm not even like, y'all know, like, I-- I'm not even the person to like, with these reaction things, but, are you serious? Yeah. Thank you, thank you so much. Right now, you know, I don't want to cry. Don't, I can't look at you guys. Ma, somebody's gonna pay for me, you know, I'm happy right now. I can't stop cheesing, ya know. Somebody's gonna pay. Michqwelyn: (on phone) Wait, I can't-- you're breaking up, wait. You hear me? They, they're gonna... Michqwelyn: Are you serious? Yes, Ma, they're gonna do that. Yes, Ma, yes, yes, yes, yes. You don't have to worry no more, so... - Michqwelyn: That's your dad. -Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh, man. Oh, man. -I can't. I'm happy... -(teachers laughing) I'm sorry, I'm sorry... (peaceful music playing) California. It's a lot of emotions going on, but like, I'm just ready. Ready when you are. Senih: Growing up in America, you get the sense of graduation being like this huge moment in your life. Nice, all right, we're good. We're set. I guess it's supposed to feel, like, magical or you know like you're coming to an end of something. But it's not something I got from my parents a lot. They're not too excited because in Turkey, it's not the biggest deal to graduate. So, when I walk across the stage, I'm not expecting much from my dad. You know, just the usual, "Hey, congrats, you did it, high school is over, get to college," you know. -Front? Is this okay? -Yeah. -Does that look good? -Yeah. Senih: Over the past year, my relationship with my dad has gotten better. I'm less reliant on, I guess, that sense of approval. You know, moving away from him now, going to college, I'm going to be put in a situation where I need to do what I do for myself and then I guess hopefully whatever I do, he'll be supportive of that. announcer: Senih Okuycucu! (cheering and applause) Senih: I made it, so I guess that's what matters. father: He went from being this little teenager fighting with his brothers to being a responsible man, and I'm very proud to see that. Senih! I don't know, it hit me like that's it. Like, he's gone. He's gone and, and I don't know, I... maybe I didn't appreciate our time together. I don't know, it felt like, oh, we could have done more... I don't know. Senih: I did it! (indistinct chatter) Senih: Thank you. father: I may not really see him as much as I used to maybe for the rest of my life. Graduation is kind of like an explicit milestone that kind of symbolizes all of that at once. It's a lot of emotions, actually. (peaceful music playing) (music fades) Isiah: I knew the day was gonna come, but I didn't expect it to come fast, you know. It's just sad because it's come at a end and you only get high school once in a lifetime. I'm also sad because, it's like, my dad couldn't make it here for me today. It would have been wonderful to have both parents at my graduation. Looking sharp, kiddo. Hey. I'm so proud, man. I wish your dad was here. Isiah: He's watching me, that's all I can say. He's watching me, he's proud. And I'm proud that I did it, and I'm proud that I got here, 'cause I know that's what he wanted. And now I'm sad and I'm trying to be happy. But it's a good day today, so, ya know, I'm gonna be happy. Jolimar: Yeah, I'm excited that, finally, everything that I have worked for throughout the past three years has finally paid off. I'm very happy that I don't have to take any student loans or be in debt for the next year. NYU gave me a full ride. Now we're having a graduation which not a lot of people had last year because of COVID and stuff, so I'm grateful. My cap says, "porque puedo y me lo merezco" in Spanish, and that translates to "because I can and I deserve it." (mother speaking Spanish) woman: It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to Fordham High School for the Arts' commencement ceremony for the graduating class of 2021. (cheering and applause) Michael: I stand here staring at you in awe, as your proud principal and filled with so many emotions. -(cheering) -Too early in the speech. I'm sorry that we couldn't give you all the senior year... student 1: Don't cry. student 2: Aw. I'm sorry that we couldn't give you the senior year you rightfully deserve... student: We love you! (cheering and applause) Go out into this world, hold your head high, be proud of who you are, what you've accomplished, and most definitely where you come from. Congratulations. I now pronounce you official graduates from Fordham High School for the Arts on the 25th day of June 2021. You may now transfer your tassels to your right! student: We outta here! (cheering continues) (lively piano music playing) (train clattering) Kyle: We're here in New York City because we wanted to be at the New York premiere of "Ranked." (crowd applauding) (crowd cheering) Linda: Jolimar Perez! Next we have Nahiely! We have Isiah, senior drama major. (cheering) -Linda: What are you wearing? -Amazon. -Linda: Ama-- Oh! Amazon! -student: Yeah! David: Seeing the kids going on their red carpet, striking a pose, feeling really special and feeling like a superstar and looking like superstars too, it reminds you of what we've all been missing.

(clears throat) Uh, I got to see you just making art, not worrying about a pandemic, and having fun and being silly. It was just such a, um, just a really great reminder that, you know, you're all still here and you're gonna be okay. And we're gonna move on and keep, keep making meaningful art.

So, pretty wild. Um, approaching 500 days. (clears throat) That's crazy. Today we at Chapman University. You know the vibe, guys. It's me and mommy here today. Move-in day. -Feelin' good. -I love this place. -Yeah. -Oh, my gosh, it's so awesome. It is really nice out here, guys. Like, really nice, the people are wonderful. Michqwelyn: The people are really wonderful. The scenery, guys, just look at everything, you know? Moved into my dorm, in SUNY Binghamton. Super excited. Here's my desk and everything. There's my side of the bed, that's my roommate's. Looking forward to an exciting year. I am still working at Country Canine Groom and Board. I've been with them for about four months now. Best first job I could have ever asked for. Working, saving up money for California. And I'm gonna be a makeup artist. I leave for school in 30 days from today. I'll be moved in on September 5th, and I started packing, and I'm really excited to live in New York for the next four years. I'm starting at West Virginia University at Parkersburg, which isn't far from home, so I'm still here at my parents' crib. And while I'm here, I'm working on a new YouTube series that quite frankly I think can take over the internet. I am currently in my college dorm. I committed to Cornell University. I have a single dorm as you guys saw. I honestly really love it here, so I'm just excited to see what's gonna happen in the next four years, but yeah. I'm finally going out at school, everything I've been working for. This is my freshman year, it's like it's finally happening. See? I'm excited. I'm really happy with where I am at right now in life. I'm doing great, and I'm still at De Anza. Uh, planning to transfer to UCLA though, um, next school year, which I am very excited for, but I am working real hard to do that, to make the plan a reality. I'm working on my associates degree in stenography at BridgeValley Community College, and I'm also still working at I Scream Sundae and Hallowbeans. Hi, everyone. I'm at lunch right now in Sichoba, a little art installation that they have here in New York City. I'm in college. I have studio in just a few minutes, so I'll see you guys later.
