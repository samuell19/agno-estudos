We passed it. We didn't pass it. I'm telling you. I'm like fucking Sacagawea. We did not pass Begin Road. It's Petah Tikva first of all. It's two names. Where did you get that? On the plane. Hey, that's so retarded. Why would a street have two names? All right. So where? There? I think that way. Yes, this way. Yes. Fantastic. OK. Be careful crossing. OK. Go, go, go. I got it. Such a worrywart. I think this is it. Yeah. Ah. Fuck. You all right? Not bad. This porch is nice. You can write out here. Think they have any liquor? What's going on? Are you depressed? It's probably just jet lag. Why did we come here? It's a little late for that. Don't. You're so beautiful when you're this fragile. I want to have you before you shatter. Stop. You were acting so weird earlier. What was the matter with you? I just needed you to get on top of me and fuck me. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Have a falafel. - Oh sure. - Yeah. Thank you. This is special falafel. Oh, special. - Special falafel? - Yeah. - For me. - It's very good. - Cheers. - Cheers. That is very special falafel. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Do you want two to go? Mhm. I'll get two to go please. The... OK. The sandwich thing. OK. And can we get two Cokes too? Two Cokes. OK. He's fun. Hm? He's fun. I think you're going to be really inspired here. It'll all be worth it. You're going to write something brilliant. You'll see. Whoa. Whoa. OK, OK. What's happening? They found a bag. A bag? Yeah. Someone probably forgot a bag or something. Oh, so they think it's a bomb? Eh. Happen all the time. OK. Thank you. How many shekels? OK. OK. OK. Thank you. Fuck. Why didn't I have my camera? God damn it. Shit. Imagine if we were here when an actual bomb went off. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hey. How are you guys? Shalom. You OK? Yeah. Um. You guys know if there's like... around here if there's a basement? A what? A basement, like underground. Under a building? No. Sorry. A room? OK. That's OK. Can you chase him with the stick again? That was cool. Yeah. Go on. Go get him. That's awesome. Hey. Hey. Here. You want to see? Want to see? See? Yeah. You guys look cool. Thank you. What? Oh, what am I... oh. Uh, I'm just... I'm making a movie. Now, you guys are in my movie. Ah. Of Tel Aviv. Kind of just for fun, you know. Well, high five. Thank you. Bam. Good. Bye, guys. Bye. You snuck up on me. Oh, so you're American? Yeah. I ask how is the book? It's uh... it's deep, but... But delicate. You know? Interesting. So much of it's in Hebrew. Uh. Cool. Sorry. I wrote it. I know. I'm getting old. No. Duh. Eva. Hi. Hi. So what are you doing in Tel Aviv? Well, I am... I'm staying at a friend's for winter break. But I'm trying to write. Ah, yeah. Trying. What are you doing here? I mean don't you teach in New York? Well, I'm here to do a guest lecture thing. Oh yeah? Yeah. You should come. Of course. Uh. Oh. I think... Um. Sorry. I've got to run. You gonna give me your autograph? It's not my... It's my sign... the address. It's not my book. OK. But I'll buy it. Again. Bye. Nice to meet you. OK. Bye. Nice to meet you. - Come to my lecture. - Yeah. I will. I will. Of course. Woo! I thought you broke up. You know, Patty Hearst called. Don't. Don't. That's exactly what she said. Don't. You don't know him. Everybody knows him. Thanks. Watch it! What? I'm sorry. I... I don't speak Hebrew. Oh, I'm drunk. I'm speaking Arabic. I said I'm sorry. I don't want any trouble, my friend. Well, I'm not looking for any new friends, so we're even. Ah. You're American? Yeah. He's from America. Oh, yes. I would love to go. I love it. Hollywood, California. So what are you doing here in Tel Aviv. I'm... I'm here with my girlfriend, and I'm... I'm working on a film. What? I'm shooting a film here. Oh, awesome. What's it about? It's kind of an experimental thing. You know? It's like a pastiche on the avant garde, a cultural realignment in video art. Can I tell you something? Of course. I'm pregnant. Who's is it? Some Arab. And I won't be. That's it. I just had to tell someone. So you're back to guys? No. I was drunk. Shayne. Shayne. Hey! Hey! Avi, hey. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm done. Yeah. This is Avi. Avi, this is Eva. She goes to school with me. Beautiful Eva. Hi. Hi. What the fuck was that about? Bills are too high. Government and the businesses keep raising taxes on the phone... No. And the cables. People can't afford to fucking live here. Yeah. Shoot your TV. Yeah. So they can't live without television? It's not just that. It's food and alcohol. It's so expensive. You know, I think there will be violence here soon. Well, if someone dies, give me a call if you can afford it. So we're smoking now, hm? When you try and kiss me later it's like making out with my father. This is Kyle. He goes to school with us too. Hello. Kyle, this is Avi. Hi, Avi. He just got out of the army, so. Oh. Yeah. Charmed. No, a cigarette wouldn't stop me. She's beautiful. That girl, I'll tell you what. The paradigms of beauty shift. You see, put her 20 years in the future, no one's going to turn their head. Why bother with her? I like having my own fan club. That isn't how you love someone. Oh, and you'd know? I know as much as you. What's your favorite film, your favorite movie? Oh, you think because I didn't go to college I don't know stuff. No. I didn't say that. I just get the feeling that you're probably not that smart. No. Someone has to keep the streets safe, so you can bandy about with your camera. OK. - Respect! - OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Respect. I'm sorry. I want to be an actor. You really had me. Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. OK, Kyle. Yeah. To your big film. You can do with your own self. Hey, what you gonna do. What a night. Do it, man. Do it. Woo! You Dream silent. What's up? Kissy. Mm. Stop. You hate it? No, I don't hate it. It's just your breath smells like an egg. Ah! You don't have to be embarrassed. My breath probably smells like shit. Would you go get coffee at that place we passed last night? What place? The place just right around the corner. We can do whatever you want. Let's just go before it gets too hot, yeah? Plus I want to shoot today. Can I tell you something? This morning she woke up and stretched out her slender frame. How the scar never healed, they moved to a place where sentiment took over. And that we had to travel so far to feel safe for the first time was not washed out by the blinding brightness of decay. Hi. I'm looking for a movie. I know the title in English but not in Hebrew. What's the title in English? It's a beautiful title. It's called Tenderness of the Wolves. It was also the basis for the movie M. Um, this is... This is like M, but it's unapologetic. Do you have any idea if you have this movie? My girlfriend hasn't seen it. I want to make her watch it. Is this it? Thanks very much. No. Don't stop. Keep going. Hey. Hey. You look good on camera. Thanks. So what are you up to? Heading home. Heading home from where? So you haven't been to bed yet? No. Of course not. You're such a libertine. A what? A libertine. Never mind. Um, I wanted to ask you, do you know where there's like a bombed out house or something? I really want to shoot something's that's been blown up. Sure. Come on. For you. Come on. Be careful. Wow. This is great. No, this is horrible. What was it? A rocket or what? Suicide bomb. It was a nightclub for young people. Just look in the mirror. Uh, what should I do? You're an actor, act. Uh. They didn't tell you? Tell me what? I... I am not an actor. What? Shayne and uh, your friend... Your girlfriend, they put me up to it. I think that they wanted to see a knife to your throat. I'm sorry. I... I thought they'd have told you. Just look in the mirror. Just keep staring, quit talking. Isn't there something that eats away at you? No. Do you? Like a poison. Well, I feel bad for you. I feel sorry for you. I accept what I am. What does that mean? What do you think I am? I don't know. Whatever you say you are. I don't know. It's just me to me, and whatever you think I am is subjective. How can one define oneself outside of just them? You have a girlfriend? Lots. Any boyfriends? No. How many people have you killed? What? You killed people in the army, right? You don't ask someone that. It isn't a trivial thing. So you have? Do you have more girlfriends or more kills? You're really bringing me down. Don't tell me. Tell yourself. Look at yourself. Good. Just keep doing that. Don't stop. Why don't you take your shirt off? Stay there. Put some of this in your mouth. What is it? It's fine. It's safe. Just don't swallow. Go on. OK. Keep looking at yourself. Suck in your cheeks a little. Slowly let it dribble out. Let it pour down your chest. So what did you think? I... I didn't understand a word. You don't? But everybody else seemed to be having a really good time. I don't know. So how are you? I mean what... what are you still doing in Tel Aviv? Well, a friend of mine that lives here is at a monastery in Italy, making cheese. So we're just staying at his apartment. With friends? Um. My... my boyfriend. Well... uh... Ex-boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend? You want a cigarette. Yeah. Uhhh. I think we're just friends. But I don't know. - You want to share it? - Yeah. All right. How's the writing going? It isn't. Oh. Yeah. Listen. Writing is... is a trauma. For me every time it's a total disaster. The... the cannibalization of emotion just wash all over me, and I just... I just let it go. Mhm. And I surrender to it. Makes sense. You have something here maybe? Of mine? Yeah. Uh. No time to surrender like the present. I did... I surrendered a little bit this morning. Oh, let's hear. Are you sure? Pretty sure. No, no, no. I can't. My handwriting is... It's a nightmare. It's just a mess. I should type it all up. Yeah, you should. Shit. Is that really the time? Yeah. I should go. I was enjoying our talk. Yeah. Yeah. I should... I should type up my stuff, and we could do it again sometime. My schedule is pretty tight for the next couple days. But listen, there is some cocktail party tomorrow in Brown Hotel with some artists and writers. If you want to come. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, of course. That's great. So, uh, until then. Bye. Well, well, well. Look who isn't dead. You drunk? Mm. You get any good stuff today? Mhm. Gold. Like Midas touched my lens. Is that Shayne's soldier friend? Please, please stop. Please. You know I don't like people looking at my shit until it's done. Sorry. I think I wrote something worthwhile today. Oh yeah? It's about time. I knew you would. "This morning she woke up and stretched out her slender... " Please, babe. Please, please, please don't read to me. It feels so weird. We're adults, man. Where you going? Shayne's maybe. I don't know. I just can't be around you right now. What are you talking about? You know you've built this whole ethic around yourself and work. You can't break through your own model anymore. Hey. Eva? Eva, Eve. Where were you last night? Shayne and a bunch of friends went to Jaffa. Your friend Avi was there. Hi. Does Avi live here? Who's this? I'm a friend of his, Kyle. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Come on in. Hey. How's it going? It's fucking hot. Yeah. Sit down. Whoa. Watching porn, huh? Yeah. You like? It's Lebanese. It's the best. So is Avi here? Avi! So are you and Avi roommates or? Brothers. Well, half-brothers. No. Thanks, man. It makes me paranoid. I'll take a drink if you got one though. Yeah? Shit, man. That's fucked up. Yeah. It'll just make me think you all hate me. Here. Are you speaking Arabic or Hebrew? They speak Arabic. Don't think I understand. I thought you guys were supposed to like hate each other or something. No, man. I love these neighbors. The weed brings us together. Avi! Avi! This kid is partying too hard. You should go wake his ass up. Yeah? Sure. Go for it. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Avi. Wake up. Avi. Slowly let it dribble out. Put some of this in your mouth. What is it? It's fine. It's safe. It's fine. It's safe. Just don't swallow. Slowly let it dribble out. Suck in your cheeks a little. Look at yourself. It's fine. It's safe. Just don't swallow. Been looking all over you. Are you drunk? No. Do you have anything to drink? What? Oh, fuck it. What'd you say? Nothing, never mind. Tell me what you said. I just asked if you had anything to drink. No. I know. That's why I said never mind. I got some really great shots today. Cool. You don't care. I care. What do you want me to say? I have no idea what you're doing. You never tell me anything. Every once in a while you give me a little more so it'll keep me interested. And I have no context to judge it. It'll all be fine for you like it always is. Is that Avi? Did you guys come here together? Don't get jealous. He came looking for you. Where have you been? I heard you came by. I was just working. Can you hand me my towel? Oh, sorry. You should go for a swim. The water is good. No. I'm OK. Is it working? No. I don't think so. Is what working? What's so funny? What's so funny? Mm. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? Oh, honey, we're tripping. You're tripping? How long? I... I don't know. An hour? Yeah, like 45 minutes, an hour. Look, Kyle, just lay back and take it. Shalom. Hello. Shalom. Are the guy from Twilight? Yeah. Thank you. You guys are beautiful. Do you want to hang out? Yeah. I'd love to hang out. Bye. Oh my god. What the fuck happened last night? I don't know. You were there, and then you disappeared. I went to sleep on a bus. And I had the weirdest dream. You and me... Please don't. What? Please don't. What's wrong? Dreams are what people talk about when they have nothing left to say to each other. I want to speak about Eva. Oh god. About her writing. She's... she's amazing. Really? Yeah. You must hear her poetry. Stop. You're embarrassing me. She's like the next new thing, and the voice of a new generation. Really? Yeah. I'm sure about it. Thank you. You have something here maybe. Treat us. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you'd never ask. I do. I wrote this the other day, and I don't know if it's any good. But maybe you can tell me what you think about it. Uh. "Pull over. I can't tell if we're moving. I want to build something on my open fly. Turn off your voice. I'll pay you the 1,000. We talk about our dreams because there's nothing left." That's it. Whoa. Ah. That's amazing. That's good. He said that when you are in a relationship, you are the most lonely that you can be. It's interesting because when I read it out loud I understand it in a different way that I'm not quite so attached to the feeling of sadness. But it's just about a friend. How's it going in there? I want you to sit here. OK. Right over there. And then you're going to be right there. - Here? - Cool. Yep. Looks great. OK. Turn your chairs to each other. What made you want to be in this film? I don't want to be in this film. I don't know what it is. So can you tell me please? This is an American film? For what? It's my film. For? What is any film for? This film is an experiment. For lik... For your fantasy? Not for my fantasy. What is the theme? It is a living, breathing document. So being models, do you ever worry about what you'll do when your looks fade? Hm? I don't know. I never thought about it yet. So do you ever have sex with any of your photographers? No. Not yet. Not yet. Do you have a boyfriend? Any girlfriends? Sometimes. No. Sometimes? Do you have a girlfriend? Sometimes. Sometimes. Go over there to the couch. For what? Because the light's nice. I want to get you on the couch. Yeah? Not because I'm wearing underwear? No. I'm completely closed in. No. Not because of that? All right. Um. I need to sit over here. Right there in the light. Hold still. You look very beautiful. You look like a little Lolita. You're Russian. You know what Lolita is? No. It's a book by Vladimir Nabokov about a Russian girl who's basically a whore. Whore? You don't know it? - No. - Hm. Mm. What does that mean? It is fuck you. Oh, so you're angry now? Say it here. You know why she's angry? Why? Because you're a little bit annoying. I'm annoy... Just a little bit. Well, my beauties, you're a lot more interesting to look at than talk to. Whoa. We'll talk about our dreams because we have nothing left to say to each other. Hi. Hi. How's it going? Good. Yeah? It's nice up here. Hello. Oh, Liam. Liam, this is Kyle. Hi, Liam. Ah, Kyle. Good to meet you. Congratulations. Thank you. She read me some of your work the other night. It was fantastic. - You want to stay, guys? - Yeah. Yeah. Have a drink. No, no, no, no. We should... we should go. I was thinking maybe we should go. I have to go, I guess. All right. It was very nice to meet you guys. Thank you so much for this lovely evening. - Thank you. - OK. Goodbye. You really have to go? Yeah. I'm sorry. Um. OK. Take care. All the best. So nice to meet you all. Really a pleasure. Bye. Good to meet you. So how hard did he try to bang you? He didn't try to bang me. Oh yeah. Sure. He was all over you. Bullshit. No. It was nice. He liked my poetry. He heard your poetry? You read them your poetry? Yeah. You just don't need to do that shit. I mean, who the fuck cares what they think? Your work should be the barometer of their intelligence, not vice versa. That's how good you are. What? Nothing. I just wish things could be good again. Why can't they be good again? You know, we'll get back to school. You'll vanish for days on end. I won't see you. I won't talk to you. And then, we'll share a couple tepid glances from across the dining hall when you slink out of the purple room with whoever you crawled out of bed with. Do you really think you are the last person I'm ever going to fuck? That was really mean. I'm sorry. I love you very much. That was very... I'm sorry. I'm just crazy. Thanks. Hello. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Come on, Kyle. - What? What? What? Just smell it. Come on. Smell my finger. God. For fuck's sake. Jesus Christ. That bitch was fucking fail. Why are you doing that? You want... you want one? Sure. Fuck you. Come on. Where are we going? Uh. Home? Oh no. Wait. Whose home? Your home or my home? Make drink. I am. You know I don't even care that you're pissing. I'm going to come in there anyway. That is a long... I just started. That is a marathon piss. Time to flush. Come on. Come. OK, Kyle. Come on. You make another drink? I... the bottle's in there. You'll get it in a minute. Come in. I want you to see this shit. I see red. Sit. Yeah. There in the corner. Sit, sit, sit. I'm going to project it. I'm going to project it. OK. It's really fucking great. Hey, when did you... When did you shoot this? When you were... You were sleeping. I came by... Wow. To look for you. Wow. It's my asshole. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. That's you. Don't mash in the carpet. Use the fucking ashtray. You are were sleeping. It looks cool. Wow. Yeah? It's just rough shit. See. This bitch was going crazy. Hi. Hey. Eva. Hey. Hi. Hi. Hello. What are you up to? Nothing. We're watching Kyle's film. Really? No, no. We weren't... we weren't watching it. No, I mean I'm just uh... I'm just showing him some rough stuff. If he sees himself onscreen, it'll help his performance, you know? Hm. Look. I'm just showing him like rough shit of himself. I want... you know, to improve the performance. That's nice. Real fucking nice. Hey. Hey. Are you mad? Hey. Hi. Are you mad? Why the fuck would I be mad? I don't know. It seems like you're a little bit angry. I'm not. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll come with you. No. It's fine I just... Come if you want. Will you shut the fuck up? Where the fuck are you going? Um. Party on Shayne's friend's yacht. I would've asked you to come, but I just... I didn't think that you want to... No, I'll come. Be on a boat all night with Shayne's friends. It'll turn into Knife on the Water. You know what. I'll come. I'll come. It's OK. Stay here with your actor. No, no. I'll come. Stay here with your actor. Eva, you're leaving? Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Have a good night. You too. Good night. Good night. Avi, she's... she's going to a yacht party. You want to come? I'll come. No. Stay here. Oh, I know- I know that one. Have fun. Seriously, I'm sorry. Kyle, forget it. If you're mad, we can go together. You don't... you don't want to go. You don't want to go. Boring. Women. She's fucking always... She's fucking pissed at me all the time. She's OK. You're gonna love it. I'm telling you it's really good. Look there's... see. I remember. See, you're all back lit. Yeah. That's beautiful. Whoa. I told you it was... It looks really good. Because what I'm trying to do with this is like... It's like Stan Brakhage, Kenneth Anger like mind meld. Do you know what I mean? You know? Yeah. Look, look there. How the light comes down. Oh yeah. That is... Like a veil with the water. That is fucking cool. That is sababa. Si... Sababa. Cool. So you like? I like it. It's fucking... Yeah? Yeah. I like it. Good. You really are amazing though onscreen. There's like... this thing that happens. You're good too. No, you are. I've never seen like this. Yeah. Well, you know... we're just going to be... we're gonna be like Herzog and Kinski. Do you know Herzog and Kinski? They did every movie together. They were obsessed with each other. But we're not going to fight like them. They fought a lot. No, we won't fight. I don't want to fight you, Kyle. We're friends. We're friends. What do you want to do now? I don't know. So drunk. What? I think maybe I try and go home... Go home. No. You don't have to go home. Yeah. No. Hey, hey, hey. Just sleep here. Are you sure? Well, yeah. Eva's out for the night. I don't give a shit. You can just sleep here. Just take the bed. I don't care. Thank you, Kyle. You're gonna be too hot. You're right. I take it off, I think. So you really like it? You really think it's cool? It's... Kyle, it's cool. It's good. I promise you it'll be awesome. You're going to watch that all night? No, no, no, no. You do your thing. Oh. Hey, Avi. Mm. Avi. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. I... I just woke up. Where's Kyle? I don't know. What are you writing? The alphabet. What is it? I'm writing a collection of poems actually. Is it for school? Yeah. Yeah, but I'll have them published. Well, you must be good then. No. Not lately. I thought coming here might help change things. But it hasn't. Well, Tel Aviv is a very cool and beautiful city. I think it will help you. What do you do? Nothing. No. Really? What do you do? Really. Nothing. I go to India, I think, soon. What's in India? Well, my brother... he has a restaurant there. Everyone goes to India after army, so. Maybe I work there, I think. You don't sound very excited. Uh. I'd rather write like you. Yeah? Yeah. Well, not books, but music and songs. Read one to me. Let's see. "And always I would touch myself until the day I was seen and began to scream, and he didn't reach for the soap." Kyle. Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle, wait! Please! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hate you. I'm sorry. I hate you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're not together. Are you in love with him? Just tell me that, if you're in love with him. Are you? No. Lust, not love. You did this just to hurt me. Maybe I did. You remember your freshman year, and we all went to Montreal for that long weekend and you decided to stay on campus? Yeah. Remember? Yeah. That weekend, uh, I never felt so alone. Come on. Stop. No. It was like I was a ghost. And that was when I knew I can't... I can't be without you. And I know you hooked up with Dylan Williams at that slave auction party. We bought you for $37. Who told you? Who didn't tell me? Everyone told me. Everyone wanted us to break up. Everybody wanted to devastate me. Why didn't you say anything? If you don't love them, if you only love me, I don't care. I don't care. Sh-shush. This is horrendous. Thank you for coming. Oh, well. Are you reading these titles? "My pussy is in Tel Aviv, but my heart is in New York." Stop. Are you fucking kidding me? Stop. Give me a fucking break. Jesus. I'm going to go say hi. OK? Hm. I'm going to hi to my friends at the bar. Hey, buddy. What's up? Oh. It's you. How amazing is this? Oh yeah. I love this one. Yeah? Yeah. So how's your film going? Oh, it's going. You know. Yeah? I got some really intense shots out by Gaza last night. By Gaza? Yeah. You're shooting in Gaza? Of course. See. Shit, man, because I'm... I'm going to be shooting in Berlin this weekend, but I really wanted to get over to Gaza and just get a bunch of shots before I left. But I don't even know... Am I allowed to go there? Like I don't even know how that works. We could go together. - With you? - Yeah. Of course. In a car? We'd just go? Yeah. I can shoot there? Yes. Oh yeah. Great. Oh, that'd be fucking great. Giddy up. Kyle. Thank you for coming. Oh yeah, of course. Seriously I'm starting to feel like Stendhal here. So moved by everything. I feel like I'm going to start getting hallucinations or something. Oh no. We don't want you to hallucinate, not tonight. I thought the use of mixed media was really smart. Hm. Thank you. Seriously, there's just like... there's just these flashes of brilliance. Would you do something for my movie, for my film? Seriously? Yes. Come on. Seriously. Would you? Yeah, I'd love to. You know, we're going to Gaza tomorrow. We should all go. I just want to check it out. - Maybe get some shots, you know. - I'm down. You need a drink? OK. Well, I'm going to be right back. And again... Thank you. Avi. Avi. Hey. Avi, hey. Hey. Go on. Avi, please. Hey. OK, I'm sorry. OK. I don't... I thought it was OK. I thought that you wanted me to. I'm sorry. I'm not going to fight you, so just go ahead and hit me. Kyle. I want you to come with me to Berlin. Hm. What? Berlin. I'm going to Berlin. - What about... - Who? What? Eva? I don't give a shit. You owe me now. And if you're really sorry, you'll come with me. You don't have to pay for anything, nothing. I just need you to... To finish the film. And the film... Avi, the film is going to be fucking amazing. And you're going to be famous. Uh... uh. It's going to be so good. You just need to finish the film. Are you OK? I'm fucking perfect. I'm perfect right now unless you say no. Unless you say no. OK. OK? OK. OK. So you're coming? OK, but, but, but, but... I want... I want... I want... I want you to... I want you to mean it. I want you to want to come. Yes, OK. I don't want to force you. OK, I do. You gotta say it. Say it. Say it. You want to come? Say it. I want to. I want you to want to. I do, man. I want... I want you to. I want you to... I want you to want me. I do. OK. It's OK. Oh. Shh. Shh. It's OK. I got you. I got you. Hey. Hey. Put the camera away. - I'm going to have to get out. - No, no. You're not fucking getting out. But there is an Arab line. OK. Put it away. What? Get out of the car right now. What's the problem? There's no filming here. Fucking assholes. It's an American camera. I'm a film student. There's no filming here. Can you say something? Show me what's in the camera. I've just been filming things in Tel Aviv. No. There's no... - Can't you say something? - I didn't know. I'm sorry. Me? I won't film any more out here. Yeah. You were a soldier. Everyone's a fucking soldier. This is crazy. I don't know what I... can I try it? What are they doing? Take it. They are filming for him? This, see? Oh my god. Go to the jeep? May I shoot you? Sure. Yeah. This guy is a genius. Right here? I do video. Yeah. It's video, but it does pictures do. Take care. We can go. Dude, you're a rock star. Bye, bye, America. Bye, bye. What did you tell them? I just told them I was making a movie and let them play with the camera. Yeah. Oh god. Avi. What? You didn't get me one? I didn't know you wanted one. No, it's OK. It's OK. I'm going to get me one. You can have mine. You can have mine. No, no, no, no. I'm good. I'm good. Kyle, put it away. Put it away. Get closer together. It's OK. Go on. Put your arm around her. See look. There they are with the guns. Oh, that looks nice. And I can't believe they let me stand on the Jeep. They asked me to stand on the Jeep. It was fucking crazy. See this shot's actually... This shot's really good. It's almost like the barbed wire is like framing the Palestinian housing. So you can use that for your film? Oh yeah. Just wait till we get to Berlin, man. So we are going. To Berlin. Yeah. Did you hear the Hughes brothers were touring Europe? Yeah. I heard that. Exciting going back to school? I don't know. I think I might actually just stay a little bit longer. Maybe take the term off. Here? That's enough. Stop the crying. I can't stand it. I'll take the baby head home. I'm not kidding. Did he just threaten to decapitate the kid? How dare you to come here with a baby... crying baby. You know when I... when I... when I took a term off and I came back to school, I never felt part of the place again. It's like the entire world passed me by. OK. Am I only the one hearing this? Enough. I can't stand it. - You have to shoot this. - Stop the crying. Give me some peace. He's fucking nuts. Hold on. Are you shooting this? I am now. You have to get him. Get him to drink. This guy is nuts. Oh shit. He saw me. They have falafel, right? They have free refills here? No. I don't think so. They have booze. Boobs? Booze, you fucking idiot. Oh. Booze. Yeah. Are you going to Berlin? I don't know. Is it just me, or have we been waiting for 40 minutes? Yeah. 40, 45. It's normal. Excuse me. Where are our drinks? It's normal? You guys ever get bitten by the mosquitoes here. I've been eaten alive since I've been here. No. Ow. I bit my fingernail too much. I think this is definitely the hottest day I've experienced. I mean it's worse than August. Wouldn't you guys say?
