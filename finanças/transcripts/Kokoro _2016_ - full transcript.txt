Yes, we can move on that option, no problem. Look, I'm here, I'm available. No, we're not leaving soon. I'll definitely need a vacation. Yeah, in the sun. Hey kids! How are you? Yes. Sorry. Really. Thanks again. - Can we hear something else? - Bye. - Ready? - One second. We'll be late. Why don't you go alone? Alice! It's pretty. Why take it all off? Anais, remember the oven? - You'll get the oven? - I heard you. Don't forget, OK? I'm leaving. - Wait, we're going to eat. - No... I don't want to. Want to go home together? Eat with them, I'll take a taxi. Too bad. It's nice here. Goodbye. And Japan! Hey! OK, my turn. I forgot to warm up. He beat me. Nathan? Little sister. - When did you get back? - Today. I'm just here a few days for the paperwork. You seem to be doing alright. You look like you had a shitty day. Lucky you, we're making crepes. We're not done. Focus. 1, 2, 3... OK, my turn. - I'm ready. - Go for it. Not so good. Every time! Bravo! - Go. - That crepe looks like a Japanese bean. - A smoke? - No. Come on, take it. "Ku-mi-ko." You need to meet her. A girl you barely know? - You have no idea. - No. - Tell me, what's going on. - I'm alive! I'm fucking alive! Know what that means? I've heard it before. What if it was true? For how much longer? You can't stand seeing me like this. Oh, stop. You can't stand it because you realize... I don't need you anymore. Those days are over. It pisses you off... to see me like this, because you're starting to realize I'm doing well far from here. And you're stuck here in your perfect life. My perfect life? Yeah... - Nathan? - Hey, Leo. What are you doing here? Nothing, just passing through. This is why you came home. - I was just leaving. - Already? Not crashing here? No. I have other plans, relax. Wait, I'm coming. See you around some time. Yeah, sure. Still have my bike? Uh, yeah. I don't know if it runs. I'll take you for a ride. You love this! Right? - What? - Nothing. - I can't hear. - Watch the road. I forgot this place existed. Stop! Nathan. - Come back, stop. - Ever want to jump? - Just to see what it feels like? - Stop. Stop! You're freaking me out. Don't worry. I've moved on, I'm done, it's over. I had a wild encounter. Yeah. Kumiko? Yeah, not just Kumiko. A guy... opened my eyes, to many things. Daisuke. - What did he help you see? - My reasons for being alive... You met a Buddhist monk? No. Just a guy. Who... listens, and... doesn't expect anything in return. It sounds dumb, but it's rare. You coming with me to Japan? - Are you nuts? - I'm serious. Come with me. What would I do in Japan? Get some air, see something else. I'm happy here. Really? You're happy? What? You're going to save me? Fuck... Your fire is out. When do you leave? When my papers are ready, and... I need to get some money. - What are you doing? - How much? Wait, what are you doing? - Go on, take it. - I don't want your money! You always did when you were in trouble. Fuck, you're... Fuck... Where are you, Alice? - What? - My sister, Alice, where is she? Look at you! I may not have money, but I know where I am. I know where I am. Nathan! - No. - Why not? None of your business. - Tell me who. - Don't look! Leave your sister alone. Stop! Stop. Hello? Yes? Hello? I can hardly hear you. Yes, I'm his sister. Yes. No, no one else. I'm his only family. What's wrong? Impossible. - It can't be! - Alice! Alice! - What's up? - It... It... It can't be. What is it? Your brother was killed by a car running a red light. He was hit at 60 km/h. That's all we know for now. The driver was immediately arrested. Here are his personal effects, found on the bike. He shouldn't have gone back. He told me about a man who helped him. When we met, he'd come from here. It's famous. Many Japanese go there to jump from the cliff. To jump? Nathan heard about it. That's why he went. Daisuke is an ex-cop from the town. He spends his days watching the cliffs. When he sees someone at the edge, he stops them and takes them in. That's how he met Nathan? It was a fresh start for him. Don't go to the cliffs. It's better for you. You met him? I haven't seen her since Yoko died. Breathe in, breathe out. I've been her for days, now. And I still don't understand why you do this. I imagined doing it, like anyone else.
