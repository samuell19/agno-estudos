- Sir? Sir, your wife's on the phone. - Um, thank you. Could you close the door on the way out? Hey Wen. No no no no. I think I found a way to help us. Yeah, I'm sitting here doing the company bonuses for the employees, and well, if I fire Marc, and add his bonus to mine, no no no, it's a considerable amount of money. - Marc, Mr. Hamilton needs to see you right away. He's in his office. Go right in. - Come on in, Marc. No no, don't sit down. Marc, what I'm about to tell you is not easy. But I regret to inform you that your services are no longer needed at this company. Matter of fact, I'm gonna need you to take your belongings here, and I'm gonna need you to leave the building at once. And I don't want to hear a word out of you. I cannot believe that someone, filed a sexual complaint against you. You're lucky that she's not pressing charges. No no, not a word, just leave! Okay, leave the building. You're lucky you're not leaving in the back of a cop car. I told him that someone filed a sexual complaint against him. No, no one really did, no. No no no no. It's a considerable amount of money, Wen. I didn't want to do it. But I had to do it. To save the house and for you and the boys. And there might be enough left over for the car. Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be okay, Wen. He's a smart guy. He's gonna land on his feet, he'll be fine. I promise. Okay, and Wen? I love you. Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. - I'm home, Wen. - Hey babe! - Hey. - How was your day? - Good, good, how was yours? - Good. - Good, good. How was class? - It was great. I want to show you one of the moves I perfected. Here, let me show you. Okay, all right backs against the wall. Your hand is on my throat. - No. - I've been practicing, come on. Come on, come on come on. - All right. Whoa, okay. Wow, wow okay. - That's okay. At last I won't be using it anytime soon. - No, you will not. These are beautiful. Where'd you get them from? - What? - Where'd you get them from? - I thought they were... No no no no. No no, they must be from... - Okay, it's okay. Come here. - Hello? I need help. For the past year, I've been stalked. No, I don't know who it is. But he leaves notes on my car, and flowers at my house, and he calls my phone. He knows where I work and where I park my car. He knows where I like to go shopping. I just don't feel safe anymore. What do you mean? You're trying to tell me there's nothing you can do? Unless he attacks me? Hello? - Wendy? Are you okay? - Wendy, Wendy, Wendy. Did you really think it would be that easy? Our fun has just begun. - Wendy, we've gotta go. - I killed the meter reader. I killed the meter reader. I can't believe I killed the meter reader. I thought it was that man. I thought it was that man. - Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna load up the car, we're gonna get out of here. I'm gonna call my mother, talk to her from the road, and tell her to have the boys ready for us when we get there. - We can't put luggage in the trunk. There's a body in the trunk. - What's going on? - What are you guys doing here? - Grandpa just dropped us off. Everything all right? - Yeah, what's with all the luggage? - Um your father and I, your father and I thought it would be a good idea if we went to the lakehouse for a little while. - Yes, it would really be nice to get away for a couple of days. - Okay. - All right. - Why don't you boys put the luggage in the car? - You just want me to put it in the back? - No no no no, in the backseat. Not the trunk, it's full. - Why not? - Just put it in the backseat. - Okay. - Okay guys, here's what we're gonna do. I need you to take the luggage and go inside the house. Your mom and I are gonna get some food. - And lock the door. - Wen, think we should've called the cops, and told them it was accident. - If we did that, I would be arrested. Do you want me to go to jail? Besides, that stalker guy said that if we involve the police, that he would kill the boys. He is always watching us. That's not a chance we can take. I just... We'll say we were at the lakehouse, okay? We weren't even home. If we get questioned. - So what are we doing here? - What are we, on the run? - Don't be silly. Your mom and I just thought it'd be nice to get away for a little while. - This sucks. - I have a party to go to tonight, okay? I'm going to go. This stupid trip wasn't my idea. - I had a championship soccer game, all right I was going... - Enough okay? No one's going anywhere and that's final. Do you understand me? - Boys, listen to your father. I don't want to hear another word about it. I'll be going into town in a little bit. To pick up some supplies. And I'll call the cable company and have them set everything up, okay? You'll be around, right Steve? - Yeah, I'll be here. - And boys, I thought it would be nice, if you invited Mr. Walker over for dinner tonight. - Can Josh just go do it? I really just want to eat and go back to bed. - Yeah, I'll invite him over, Mom. - I hate eggs. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Let me get the door for you, pretty lady. - Oh thanks. - Oh hi, those are my favorite right there. - That's great. Um, I see you work at the pizza shop. I was thinking about ordering pizza for dinner. - Oh yeah you should. We're the best in town. Thirty minutes or less, or it's free. - Great. Hey Amelia, it's good to see you. - Hi Mrs. Hamilton, it's so nice to see you again. - Thank you. Oh, excuse me! Hello? Oh yes, uh-huh. We're just gonna be at our lakehouse for a little bit. Can you please set up our Internet and cable and all that? Uh-huh, yep today would be best. Do you think... Yeah, do you need the address? Yeah it's 1911 West Lake Drive. Okay, and somebody will be by today? All right, great. Bye. Sorry about that. - No problem. - Could I get two dozen donuts, please? - Sure thing. Total is gonna be $19.40. When did you get into town? - Oh we got into town yesterday morning. Yeah, we just decided we need a little time by the lake. - That's so nice. Well, I hope you enjoy your time at the lake. - Thank you. There you go. Have a great day. - You too, bye. - Hey there, Amelia. Oh man, she's so hot! And I'm pretty sure she's really into me. Do you know if she's available? - I can't believe you just asked me that. - Oh really, what about you? Are you single? - If you aren't going to buy anything, please leave, you creep. - Mr. Walker? Mr. Walker, are you in there? My mom wanted to invite you over to dinner tonight. - Hi, I'm Leon, is Wendy here? - No, no she's not. How do you know Wendy? - I uh, I talked to her on the phone. Yeah, she sounds like a really nice lady by the way. Good job, yeah. I'm here to set up your cable, sir. - Oh yeah come on in. - Perfect, thank you. - It's right over here. - Wow! Yeah! I like it. - It's right here, it's right here. - That must be Wendy right there, yeah. All right. So you and your boys are gone all day, leaving that beautiful wife of yours here all alone. - Look man, why don't you just do your job? And leave my family out of it. - Oh, if that came off the wrong way, I didn't mean anything by it. - How long is this gonna take anyway? - Oh well, I've already connected your cables outside. And in here, I am done right now. Oh hey, I'm gonna need you to sign right there. - There you go. - Thank you. - All right. Leon! - Yeah! Oh hi Wendy. - Hi! - Yeah yeah! - Pizza for dinner, Steve? - That's just odd. Whoa whoa buddy, what's going on? - Are you okay? - There was somebody following me, I swear. - No no, it was probably just a deer or something. Nothing to worry about. - Dad, I saw someone following me. - Okay okay okay. - You know honey, I'm sure your father's right. There's nothing to worry about, okay? - Uh huh, yeah, thanks for calling Wendy. Yeah we'll get your order to you in like thirty minutes or less. Okay, or it's free. Yeah, bye. All righty guys, I need a driver. Out to Wendy for 1911 West Lake Drive. Anybody got me? - Yeah, yeah. - It's my turn. Hey, I got it boss. - Thank you. - Don't wait up. - I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make it tonight, dude. Look, my parents decided to plan some stupid unplanned trip to our lakehouse. - Come on man, come on. You have to come. It's gonna be so freaking lit. We've been planning this party for over a month, and all the girls are gonna be there. Megan's gonna be there. You could ask her out. - All right, how soon can you be here? I'll have to sneak out. Look at that, saved by the bell. - Hey dudes, is Wendy here? - Wendy, how do you know my mom? - We're good friends. - You are friends with my mom? - Yup. - I don't think so. - Hey Mom! - Your friend is here. Craig, was it? - I'm sorry, is there a problem? I paid for the pizzas when I called the order in. - Hey Wendy, don't you remember me from the donut store earlier? Can I help you with the door, pretty lady? - Right, well thank you so much for bringing the pizzas. I hope you have a good night. - Yeah, but I was thinking... - So Wen, what's the story with this pizza guy? - I don't really know. I think he was that guy I met earlier at the store, but I don't actually know him. Oh, and it just got creepier. He sent me a friend request. Look. - You gotta block that creep, now. - He really seemed to like you in a very kind of special way. - You know, he kinda reminds me of... Sorry, I gotta take this. - Hey Josh. Do me a favor and go upstairs. See what your brother is up to. - Why do I need to go check up on what Hayden's doing? He's not a baby. Okay. Dude, what are you doing? - Ssh, dude, get in here. Shut the door! - Are you trying to sneak out to that party? - Corey's picking me up in a few minutes, okay? Don't tell Mom and Dad. - Wendy, you don't think Craig is the person who's been stalking you, do you? - I don't know. I mean, maybe he followed us back from the store earlier. I don't know. I didn't see anybody following us, did you? - No, I didn't see anybody. I don't think so. - I need you to cover for me. - Okay, but it'll cost you. - Whatever. - All righty then. - I'll give you 25 bucks, okay? I'll pay you tomorrow. That's if you don't rat me out. - Dude look, I got your back. - Okay, just tell Mom and Dad I went to bed early, okay? - Okay, I can do that. - Hayden said he's really exhausted, so he's in bed. - Good to see you, man. - I know it's really hard on you and your brother. That you don't get to do the things you had planned, but you know, it's really important that your Dad and I got away for a couple of days, okay? - That's all right. Yeah, don't worry about it, Mom. - So I told her like, what are you even doing here? - Have you guys seen Hayden? - No. - No, I haven't. I mean, I invited him, but who knows? - Dude, I really hope Megan's here. - I'll let you know whenever he gets here. - Okay, yeah. - You'll get VIP treatment, like you will be the first to know. - The first. - You think she's into me? - Yeah man, the whole school knows that you guys like each other. So you just gotta make your move. Trust me, it's just sometimes... Dude, grow up man! - God no, man! It's good to see you chief. - Always a pleasure. - What's up, you guys finally made it. - Yeah, I told you we were coming. - You should've seen their faces when I jumped out at them from behind. - Yeah, you really got us. - Yeah man, you never saw it coming. - Hey buddy! Sorry you didn't get to go to your party tonight. Josh! Josh! - So Hayden, how is your family vacation going? - Dude, it's like house arrest over there. Surprised I was able to sneak out. - But you got it covered this time, right? - Yeah. - I mean, we don't need your Mom showing up to this one. - Oh, I wouldn't mind if she showed up. - He's got it covered, trust me, okay? Nobody's gonna even notice he's gone. - Well, is Megan here? - Why, you gonna finally ask her out? - Maybe. - Do it. Yeah, do it, dude. Hey listen, see her? Right over there? - Yeah. - She has been asking about you all night. - All night? - Not kidding, all night. - I might do it. - Do it, yeah! - All right, I'll go for it. - That's what I'm talking about. - Yeah boy! - Hey Megan! So I heard you've been looking for me. - Maybe. You don't have to be so nervous to talk to me. We've known each other since second grade. - I'm not nervous. Maybe a little. - So what are you waiting for? All you have to do is ask. - That's all I have to do? How's tomorrow night? - Perfect. Let me give you my new number. - Sounds like a plan. - Sucks you gotta leave already. At least you got her number. - That I did, my friend. In fact, I'm seeing her tomorrow night. - Oh dude! Man, it's too bad you can't come with us to Alex's cabin later this weekend. My parents aren't expecting me home til Sunday night. - Hey man, thanks for the ride tonight. - Yeah yeah, anytime bro! - Can I get you to do me just one more favor? I'm gonna need a boost, if I'm gonna sneak back in my window. - Dude, I got you. - Right here. Gotcha bro! All right, man, good night. - Oh hey Dad! Fancy meeting you in here. - I'm sick and tired of you sneaking around behind our backs. We told you you couldn't go to the party. What are you thinking? You know what, that's it. You're never thinking. Go to bed. You're grounded. - Dad, you don't understand. There was a girl at this party I really had to see. And I have a date with her tomorrow night. I can't be grounded. - I'm sorry, you're not going. - There's something in my car? - As a matter of fact, what you're gonna be doing, is watching your brother tomorrow night, while your mother and I go out, do you understand me? - Yes sir! - Go to bed! Now! - Hello, can I help you? - Yes, Ms. Hamilton, I think you can. Name's Officer Kingsley. I need to speak to your boy. Uh Hayden? He around by any chance? - Did he do something wrong? Is he in trouble? - Yeah, if you don't mind, I'd like to really just discuss this with him. With your permission of course. - Um sure! Please come in. - Wonderful. - Get you something to eat or drink? I'll have to get Hayden from his room. He's been asleep all day. - Oh no no no! No need. There he is now. - Mom, what's going on? Is everything okay? - Oh, look at that! Look at that. Look at that, that is just lovely. Need to talk to you about your friend, Corey. Got a phone call from his mom this morning. Apparently, he never made it home last night. It's my understanding that you were with him. - Yeah yeah, he gave me a ride to a party, but I don't know why his mom would've called you. She wasn't even expecting him home til tomorrow night. - Huh! Well, I mean I got a phone call. So I need answers. Think you can do that for me? - I'm sorry, what was Corey's mom's name? - He's inquisitive. You must be so proud. - To answer your question, no, I have not talked to him since then. - Did you mind if I make a quick phone call? Just out back real quick. - Sure, do what you have to. - Thank you. Be right back. - I don't know what it is about that guy, but I don't like him. Corey's mom wouldn't have reported him missing. She wasn't expecting him home until tomorrow night. - Hayden, just let the officer do his job, okay? The sooner he finishes up, the sooner he will be out of here. - Okay whatever. - So sorry. Look, not gonna tie you up right now, okay? I'm gonna give you my card. If you hear from your friend, Corey, at any point, please call me. Please call me. Good? Thank you so much for your time. Hey Wendy, I heard a report of a missing meter reader in the next town. Do be careful. - Thanks Officer. - Welcome. Oh God, good kid! - Hayden, if you know anything about your friend, please you have to tell someone. His parents are probably worried sick. And honey, I can't believe you snuck out last night. - Look, I'm really sorry okay? - Was a good one. - Hey Wendy! - What are you doing here? Why don't you just leave me alone? - Listen to what I'm about to say to you, because I'm only gonna say this one time. Leave my wife alone. Stop bringing flowers to my wife to my house. Do I make myself clear? - Chill out man, I didn't know she was married. She came on to me. - I'm warning you. Get out! - No no no no! - All I did was say hi. I don't understand why people take kindness to mean that I want to date them. Hopefully, it's the last we'll see of him. - For his sake, it better be. - How can this day get any effing worse? - Hey boys! Your mom and I are going out to take care of some business. Lock the doors, we'll be back in a little while. Hayden, don't even think about leaving the house. - And boys, don't make too much of a mess. - I need to talk to you about what happened this morning. When you and Josh were out fishing. I didn't want to mention it earlier, because the boys were around. - What happened? - A police officer came by the house to talk to Hayden. Corey didn't make it home last night. But honestly, that's not the worst of it. He told me to be careful. Because there's a missing meter reader in the next town over. - Did he act as if he knew we had something to do with it? - I don't, I don't think he's onto us. - Do you think he knows we had something to do with it? - No, I don't think he knows. It was more of a warning. - Wen, I don't know what we're gonna do if they find out that we did it. - Hey hey, Hayden, wake up please! Hayden, wake up! Wake up, Hayden, wake up! Hayden, no please please no! Hayden no, wake up Hayden! - Look at this mess. Josh, Hayden, get down here now! - Josh, Hayden! They need to get down here and clean this mess up. That boy better not have snuck out again. Josh, Hayden! - Great, I'll look upstairs, you look outside. - Josh, Hayden! - Steve, did you find them? Steve! - Why are you doing this? Leave my family alone. What do you want, what do you want? What do you want, money? I'll get you all that you want. - Please. - Answer me! - Please, just let my children go. Please. - What do you want? Answer me! I said answer me now! - Why? - Just stop! Stop what you're doing! - Why? - Stop! - Do I look like one of your employees, huh? Do I? How about now? - Marc. - Hi. - Marc? - Officer Kingsley, what's going on? Why are you doing this? - You didn't tell them. What? - You don't have to do this. - Is this a joke? - You don't have to do this. Just stop and think about what you're doing. - Did you think about what you did? - I can fix this, Marc. - Did you think about what you did? You can fix it, how? - Marc, I can make all this go away. - Make it go away how? - Figure something out, Marc. - You can bring my family back? Please tell me how. - I'll talk to them. - Sell me something. - I'll talk... - Give me a deal. - I'll fix it. Just give me a chance. - How? - Let my family go. They have nothing to do with this. - Ten, nine, - I'm who you want. - Eight, seven. - I'm who you want, you have me. - Six, five. - Let them go, let them go now! - They're gonna die. - Marc. - They're gonna die, four, three. - Marc stop! - Two. - I can make everything better. I can fix this. - Hey, did he tell you what he did? - No. - You didn't tell them. - No I didn't. - Why not? - Cause I had to do it. - You had to do it. - I had to do it. - Do you know? - No. - Hey, do you know? - No. - What is he talking about? - Your father fired me. For no good reason. I lost my job, my home, my wife, my wife! She took my babies from me. Imagine it. Because of him, because of you. I lost every. - Please don't. - I lost everything! Because of you. Because of you, I lost everything. So now these eyes, open them, open them! Look at them. I'm gonna make you watch. I'm gonna make you watch. - Stop it! - Shut up! I'm gonna make you watch. So focus. - Just think about what you're doing. - Hiya buddy! Now I'm gonna make sure. This will only take a couple hits, okay? - Oh Mark, stop stop! - I'll try to make it quick, but sometimes it gets hung up on the spot, okay? And you, hmm! Let's see here. Like Whack-A-Mole? - No, please no! - Just stop, Mark! - You lied! Daddy's a liar. I'm not, I'm gonna pop you on the head. - No, please no! - Just stop! - What a baby! - Stop it! - Please. - I'm a liar. I could be your daddy, huh? You know when I had my hands around your throat, and I was choking you, I felt a connection. I thought it was special. You know, you will learn to love me. I'm looking for a new wife. I changed my mind. You are used up. I don't want you anymore, cause you hurt my feelings. It won't be quick. It will be fun. And you, you get something special. Ladies and gentlemen, the main attract...
