By the night Anita Bell came... I'd given up hope that anything good would ever happen to Martha and me. But sometimes, the best things come disguised... And you can't recognize them till a long time later. - What is going on? - Christ! Anita? Anita, what the fuck are you doing? Anita? Anita, is that you? Anita, I am here working! Now go on home. - Oh my God! - Get out of the way! Anita! Stop! Is she all right? Anita... You wanted to, didn't it, Steve? Didn't it? Got what you wanted to, didn't it? Steve? Dammit, Anita! Put the goddamn gun down! Why? Don't you like being here with my husband? Huh? You like spending time with my husband? I didn't think she'd be so good in bed, Steve! Looks like a real tight-ass to me! Now me, I'm fun! I'm a hell of a lot of fun! Nothing's going on here, sweetheart. I told you yesterday... Don't give me that shit! We're working! Anita, no! Anita, Anita, please! Martha, no! It's not funny! No, it's not. Are you all right? Look, I, I don't know what you think... Was going on here, but we were working. I bet you were. These are voter registration lists... You know he's in the middle of a campaign... What're you doing? Holding his dick? That's enough, Anita. Mom! What'd she do? Why don't you ask him what he did... I said, that's enough! All she had was a beer tonight. She was fine. Well, she's loaded now. Stay away from me. I mean it! She was going to shoot, Frances. She's drunk. She drinks too much. I'm sorry, Dad. I suppose she's not very happy. I don't wanna go home! David called and said she was drunk. He thought she was coming over here. Just go to bed now. It's all over. You gotta go to work tomorrow. Oh, watch your feet. There's glass. I don't wanna go home! I'll be home in a little while. Look after your mom. Frannie... I'm so sorry. You ought to go home. But I want to be here with you. Come on. You should go home. Go home. I was 15 when I came to Horace Beecham's house, to take care of Martha for my brother Floyd. Martha was nine and her mother had just died. She'd always been odd. My brother dragged her around to doctors trying to put a name on it. But there was nothing about it they could count or label, or even less they could do to change it. So they gave up, and Martha became mine. Rock, paper, scissors. Martha! Oh. Oh, Martha! Good morning, Martha. Good morning. Oh, she has something in her hands. Oh, it's a box! What do you have in your box, Martha? Fig bars. Oh, Martha has fig bars in her box! They taste so good now, don't they Martha? Let me taste those fig bars. Let me get some fig bars. Okay, just stop it now, you boys. Can I have a taste, Martha, from your pretty little pink box? Hey, Martha! Go on, Martha! Get outta here! Come on, Martha! Go on, get outta here! Edward Lynch! Paul Gilcrest! What did I tell you? You're too big to be acting like little jerks! Carry that box, Martha! You okay? Huh? Why do you let them see they bother you? You should start to ignore 'em. Huh? I have fig bars. I'm on a diet. I told you not to bring 'em. I'm gettin' fat. You know what Getso says? No one's ever gonna get hurt gettin' too close to me. You like them. I'm not doing this. Oh, Birdy! They're so good though. Save it. There's money gone again, 15, 20 bucks. I know that. I didn't tell ya, but I'll figure it out. Well, I didn't take it. I didn't say that. It must be a check or something... Better not yell at her. Don't yell at her. She wouldn't do that! Why would anybody steal here? We make so much money. Get outta here. What's he yammering about now? Just bullshit. And yet again. Just get through the day and we'll party tonight. You comin'? Where? The party at my sister's. I put the card in your locker. Martha! My hands are really dried out. Oh, don't miss the party. Oh, Birdy. Martha was happy for me when I married Horace Beecham. She was the only one who didn't seem to care that I was 16 and Beech was 50... Or think that all I wanted from him was his money. She cried with me when he died... The way she did when they buried her father. But she'd never come live in the big house. She wanted to stay in her own bed where she'd always slept. The rest didn't mean anything to her. How ya doin'? My name is, uh, Mac. Oh. You, uh, Mrs. Beecham? She's not here right now. Oh. Maybe you can, uh... Tell me about this, about this job. Well, you shouldn't have taken that notice down. That's for someone to fix the mess that Anita made. So, uh, when will she be back? I don't know. Okay, thanks. I'll wait. She wouldn't like that. What would she like? Ah, you should come back in daylight. And you should get cleaned up. But you should put that notice back, where everybody else can see it too. It's not just for you. It was for a lot of people to see it. Uh, thanks. Good night. Well, thank you so much, I've had such a wonderful time. Thank you for inviting me, I've had such a wonderful... I thank you for inviting me, I've had such a fine time. Well, it's been a really fun thing. Fine time. "Wear bright, friendly colors." Got that! "Make and maintain eye contact." Goes with every decor, ladies! That's right! And for $179.99, this demonstration set, is yours to take home to your family! The kids can't break it, the dogs can't eat it, the old man can't say it costs too much. This set will change your life, ladies, and there isn't a thing it can't do. Well, there are one or two things it can't do. Oh, sure. But, the lucky lady who buys this deluxe set, here tonight, as a special bonus will be receiving... The cheese keeper, the grater/slicer, and you've never seen a greater slicer than this, and best of all this, our classic plastic pickle holder. Isn't that nice? With the special plastic pickle picker-upper. Ladies, I'm all yours. The store is now open. Please, descend on me, if you will. I'm gonna take it. Are... What are you doing? I'll take the deluxe set. Martha, don't be ridiculous. Birdy does not expect you to buy the most expensive thing here. I know, but I want it. Ah, no, there is only one deluxe set and this lady has, uh, spoken up for it. You don't need all this stuff. I mean, look at it. It's a lot of stuff. I mean, she lives in this little guest house apartment. You don't need it. You just don't need it. Mercy... I'm not, I'm not always gonna live in that apartment. - Martha. - Yes, of course... Come on, Martha. Mercy, why... Now it's... Ma'am? Excuse me. Excuse me! - Good night! - Bye, Martha. Good mornin', beautiful! Hit the wall, why don't you? Hey, nice parkin' job. It's the brakes. Why don't you fix the brakes? What's the matter with the brakes? It's like stepping on s'mores. I like to keep 'em soft like this. Like that? Hey, Martha. How ya doin', sweet cakes? Have a hot weekend? Wanna recycle this? I went to the bakery early this morning, because the fig squares have been selling out. That's good. Great. Yeah, they sell out. Birdy? I'm sorry about what happened at your sister's. Martha, don't worry about it. I really am! No, I really am because... It's no big deal. No, but whenever I mess up, you're the one that... You make it seem like nothing happened at all and that... You are my friend and I... It's no big deal. But I'm ashamed! I'm sorry. You'll forgive me, won't you? Enough! Martha! Stop! Hey, hey, whatever comes natural, you know. Oh, you're sick. Hello? Cleaners... Still sick? Okay. Birdy? Hey... She down at the loading dock? Yes. Morning. Hello? Hello? Uh, wasn't that quite a concert on the commons last night? I wasn't there. Neither was I. I, I heard it on my porch. Heavy starch folded, right? Yeah. I'm in a hurry here. Wesley. Wesley. Andy. Uh, Andy, I wanted to... It should be right here... But it's not. It's not here. I'll be right back. This is your slip. You wrote it and it's out of sequence, and the man is in a hurry. Oh shit, I forgot! I promised him this morning and I forgot! Here, uh, they're coffee stains. Go to a pre-spot, then bag it. He'll know. He's not gonna know. Jesus Christ, don't just stand there. That's Gately, the fuckin' president of the fucking bank I'm trying to get on the board of. Now, go! Go. You hit it. I'll steam it. Don't work too hard. She's hand pressing it. It might be a bit damp, but it's better that way. Hand pressed. Here she is. And there you are. John, I really appreciate this. Next chamber breakfast, I'll wear a bib. What do I owe you? Ah, the girl has the slip. Five dollars. Five dollars. Thank you, John. No, excuse me! Excuse me, sir? This jacket has not been dry-cleaned. He's lying to you and it's not right, not at all, not one bit. See, you're paying for work that wasn't done, because they only spotted it. Martha, you're losin' it... Look, the jacket's clean. There's nothing on it. Birdy, tell him. The jacket's clean. The jacket's clean. I'm sure it is. Great job. No problem. No, I think you should leave it and let him clean it properly. It's all right. I think maybe just you should... Oh, Jesus Christ! I'm sorry, Andy. I don't have time for screwballs. Ah, just a minute, Andy, I think I've got something you can wear. Uh, let's see. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to break your jacket. Martha. That's not what I wanted to do. Please, John, give her a chance as a favor for me, poor thing. So look what I end up with, Martha Horgan. Here, take this and come back for yours this afternoon, and, uh... Thanks for understanding. It's all right. Oh! That's it, I've had it. She's finished. You're fired! Why? She asks why. Unbelievable! After this, she asks why. Because you told a customer that I was lying! You were lying. I let the missing money go. But I can't deal with this. I don't care who your aunt is. You think I took money? It wasn't me that took money! Getso did. I saw him. He took it out of the cash drawer. Before you got here this morning, I saw him. I did! I was gonna tell Birdy. She should know because she counted it. How much was gone, Birdy? How much did he take, Birdy? I saw him! So, so count it. Count it, count it. Here. Talk to her. Do something. Count it! Count it, Birdy! I saw Getso, he took it right from the drawer. Martha, shut up. Don't you even care? That's why money's missing all the time. I saw him take it. Count it! He took two bills out just like this, and then he put it down his pants like that! Call Getso up here. Get him up here now. Good then. He won't take advantage of her. He won't make her sad. He hurts her feelings. Tell her. Tell her to her face. I saw you take two tens out of the drawer. No, no... And he saw you last week too. Thursday you took $15. Friday you're off, nothing's gone. Then Saturday $20 short, and today, bingo! No! No! Hey! Hey! I know you like me, but not here, girl, huh? Martha, stop it! Goddamn screwball gives me the creeps. Why'd you keep her so long for? Frances was paying her salary. What, you got her for free, you cheap bastard? Cleaners. Mercy speaking. Cleaners. Is Birdy Dusser there, please? Um, she's not here right now. No, I know she's there. Tell her it's really important. Tell her it's an emergency. She stepped out. I can hear her, Mercy. No, she went to the bank. She doesn't go to the bank on Mondays, Mercy! Martha, she went today, okay? Okay. Tell her that I'm at home. She can call me here. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her. You take it easy now, okay, Mart? Keep your chin up. Mrs. Beecham, my name is Colin Mackey. I've come about the carpentry job. I figured you'd be an old lady. Have any references? Um, no, just, uh, been working out of state last couple of years. Washington, Oregon. Odd jobs, you know, whatever I could get. Dish washing. My last job was with a fencing company digging postholes. I dig a mean hole. Look, I'm sorry, but we're looking for someone to do carpentry. I'm a carpenter as well. Well, why don't you give me your number? I'll call you and let you know. Uh, I don't have a phone. You call me then. When? Ah, Wednesday. What's gonna change between now and Wednesday? You're not gonna like me any better. It's nice meeting you, Mr. Mackey. Mrs. Beecham? I'm a respectable person. I want you to know that. Good. Call me Wednesday. I'll let you know. I bet you will. Half smashed. You should have smelled his breath. And he's got the nerve to ask for work. I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever get the house fixed before the party. Remember to put the milk back. What do you care if it spoils? You don't buy it. Martha... Here's money. Oh, for God's sake. I'll buy milk. Okay, look, I'm sorry. The house is a wreck. My life is a wreck. I mean, the pipe broke, I come back, there's this drunk man in the driveway. Just give me a break, okay? No, I'll get my own food. Oh, come on. I'm not gonna eat here anymore. Martha, look, I said I was sorry. Just quit being ridiculous, okay? Cookie dough, the one with the chocolate stripe that looked like flowers. And some fig newtons. I love fig newtons! So, there, you never buy fig newtons... Hey, how you doin'? Your advice was no good. What? I cleaned myself up, I came back in daylight. Where ya going? Oh, into town. Oh, yeah, that's where I'm goin'. Jump in, I'll give you a lift. No, thanks. Come on, jump in. I'm not gonna eat ya. Does your sister have someone else in mind for this job? She's not my sister. She's my aunt. Oh, I see, I see. You could have fooled me. That's what everybody says. Really? Well, the place looks as if somebody's taking care of it, that's for sure. My father used to. Why'd he stop? He died. Oh. I'm sorry. Why is she looking for somebody now? Well, she's been looking for a handyman for a long time. The thing is, now... Steve's wife wrecked the porch and she doesn't want anyone to see it. Because if you run for state assembly, you cannot have a drunk wife. And she has to get it fixed before his birthday 'cause she's giving him a party. But she can't ask Steve to fix it because it's a surprise. You're welcome. Thank you. You want me to wait? For what? Get the quarter. Get the quarter. Paper or plastic? Hey, how ya doin'? Ah, Martha, listen. No! Hey, wait up. No! Martha, look out! Look what you did. You're such a fool. Come on, let me help you up. Don't! No! No! Don't touch me! What's the matter with you? You are such a screwball. Get away from me! Hey, hey! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Don't you lay another finger on her. Okay? What? Hey, hey. Don't worry. I'm just trying to help her out here. Oh, yeah? She sure as hell doesn't think so. What, you think I'm attackin' her or somethin'? Come on, are you fuckin' nuts? Just get the fuck outta here. Beat it. Yeah, okay... Next time I'll just step right over the fuckin' screwball. What did you say? Tell me I didn't hear ya right. Tell me I didn't hear ya say that. What the... Hey, Lancelot, go fuck yourself. Hey, while you're at it, do her too, huh? Why, you son-of-a... Martha! It's okay, Martha! Martha! Yeah, run, ya chicken-shit! Jesus Christ! What... Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Ah, just doin' some work. Where's Martha? She's in there. Martha! Martha! What were you thinking? You let a perfect stranger just come here and just start working? He drove me home. Oh, oh, that's great. He drove you home. That's wonderful. You just get in a car with a man you don't even know, and then you just let him stay here. I'm sorry, it was my fault. I just figured that she wanted a lift and I was... Don't just figure, Mr. Mackey. Not here, not on my property. Mac... Why don't you just call me Mac? There's no need to call you anything. You don't seem to understand. I want you out of here. And don't come back. I'll be honest. I did what I could over there because I thought that maybe, you might be desperate enough for a carpenter to hire me. Desperation is not how I do business. Of course it isn't. That was presumptuous of me. I'll just get my crowbar, rip this outta here, okay? No. Why aren't you using footings? Because you don't need 'em. The posts are pressure treated, guaranteed to last for 40 years. Are you gonna hold onto that? Of course. Why, you think you're gonna be around in 40 years time? Martha! Martha, open the door. Open up. Martha, can I use your phone? I gotta make a phone call. I'm gettin' too old for this shit. I get hangovers now before I... Before I finish drinkin'. You ever been drunk, Martha? Hi, this is Julie, leave me a message at the tone. I don't feel so good. Oh God. Come here. Sit down. Sit down over there. Go on, sit on the chair. Okay. Put your hand like this. Like this. Close your eyes. Are you a Catholic, Martha? Doesn't matter, 'cause you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about anyway. Okay. Bless me, Martha, for I have sinned. I've cheated. I've stolen things. I have fornicated. I've been slothful. Sweet Jesus, I've never even voted. Give me absolution. Give me absolution, Martha. Give me absolution. Oh, Martha... You're a wonder. You're like... You're like a primitive thing... That's never been spoiled. You might as well live in a glass cocoon. I want you to tell me things, okay? Hmm? I want you to stay up all night and talk to me. No, I can't do that. What do ya mean ya can't? Of course ya can. Oh God. I need a fuckin' drink! Oh. Mmm, yeah. I can feel all the hard seedpods... Softenin'... Swellin'... You know what I mean? What is this? Real Tupperware. Oh. It's real Tupperware. I got it at Birdy Dusser's. Everybody got one. I wanted to get the deluxe set, but Mercy said my place wasn't big enough. But it's real. Hey. You know somebody called Birdy Dusser? Yes. No, you don't. Do you know her? You're only makin' that up, aren't you? There's nobody called Birdy Dusser. Birdy Dusser! She works at the dry cleaners. What are you doing? Mr. Mackey? Hey, come on! Come on! Get your hands off me! Bitch... Go on. Go on, now, then. Go on. Please. Hello? Cleaners. Birdy, don't hang up, please, don't hang up. It's about Getso. I know you don't want to believe me, but I saw him, Birdy. I saw him. He took the two bills out of the cash drawer and he put it down the front of his pants. It wasn't me. I swear to you it wasn't me. Birdy, please believe me. Believe me, Birdy. See, Birdy, in my whole life, nobody's ever been as nice to me as you have. Birdy? Oh, I don't know how to say this. Wait, don't hang up. I love you so much. Birdy? Birdy! Birdy? Martha, nothing has been taken since you left. No! He's waiting. See? That's it. That's it! He's waiting! That's how bad he is. Birdy, he's just... Martha. He's waiting. I wouldn't lie to you, 'cause I'm your best friend! I wouldn't lie to you! Birdy, you've gotta believe me. - Oh! - Martha! What? Try these on so we can pick one. Hey, your glasses are crooked. Oh. What are they? Dresses for Steve's party. I don't want you to buy dresses for Steve's party! Oh, come on. I don't want you to! I'm just trying to make things easier on you. But I can shop for myself! Fine! Fine! I, uh, I need you to check some, uh... Some paint colors. Can I help you? I was just looking. I'm trying to get your flair. Hmm. Intro. Intro. Come here, come here, I want to show you something. "The intro woman is serious and quiet-minded. "But her heart's all razzmatazz. "She's at home in cool greens and vibrant blues. "Her scents are woodsy and clean like rain in a pine forest." Why don't you keep this? This has all of your colors and all of your scents for your particular flair, which as I said is... Intro. Intro, exactly. We have an entire beauty line for your personal flair. Do you know what I would love to do? I would love to make you over, if you have the time. Wouldn't that be fun? That way, you can get the kit at regular price... And as a special bonus, we are offering our wonderful intro cologne at half price. This is some lovely stuff. You're gonna like it. Mmm. Okay, come on over. Here, here, here, sit, sit! We're gonna have some fun. Yes, yes, yes! You look beautiful, don't you? I tell you what, though, we've got to do something about the hair. You have beautiful bones. We want to see them, okay? I'm thinking something young, something fun, something feathered, something layered. Carmella. You'll love her. She's fabulous. Carmella! We could just take an inch off. Yellow bird. So, don't be mad at me, Birdy. No, I wanna go! Come on! Come on! No, no, no, no! Come on, let's go back inside. No! Why not? I'm sore, I gotta get home. Come on, let's go back inside. It's dark in there. Oh, yeah! I'm sore too. So what? What's wrong? Jesus Christ! What the fuck are you... What the fuck are you... Hey! Hey! What did you do to yourself? I cut my hair. How could you let someone do this to you? This is my flair. This is just like you. Oh, geez. That was lousy. You're never gonna get what you want talkin' to her like that. Did it ever occur to you that what she needs... Is maybe a little, uh, kindness? Did it ever occur to you that you don't know what you're talking about? Occurs to me just about all the time. Martha? Martha? Martha. Martha? Oh. Your door was open. I got you something. Open it. Go on, open it, open it. Oh. Hey. The deluxe set. Thank you. Thank you. It's, it's wonderful. And I like green so much. Like your eyes. My eyes are blue. But I like this. No, they're not. Well, yeah, they are. I think I should know. They're blue. All this time you thought your eyes were blue. Here, let me show ya. Green. They're green. You know... I been thinkin' about you all night. You been thinkin' about me? Hmm? No, you haven't. No. You been thinkin' about Birdy and Getso. Getso is so hateful. He lies, and I... I need to tell Birdy the truth. Oh, the truth. The... The truth. The truth is, she doesn't want to know anything about the fucking truth. Don't be frightened of me. Here. I just... I just came to tell ya how nice you look. You do. Oh, you look so nice. Thank you. And I like your haircut. I do. It's different. It is. Bye. Okay. A terrific cut for the party. I don't like parties, really. Huh. Don't ya like to dance? Don't know how to dance. You don... You don't know... Come here. Colin Mackey's one easy lesson in fake dancing. Here. Jump up on my shoes. Up on my shoes. That's it. Relax. Don't be frightened. Don't be... Don't be afraid to be touchin', Martha. Perfect strangers touch when they're dancin'. I like you. You like me, don't ya? Mmm-hmm. You're so soft and warm. So soft. Oh, God, I'm a professional asshole. I gotta find a new line of work. This is takin' its toll. Don't be frightened, Martha. Don't be afraid. Good girl. Mmm. Put your tongue out, like this. That's it. That's it. Oh. That's it. Martha? This is yours? Where did you get that? That man, Getso. He's here? No, no, no, he left them down by the mailbox. He said you were in his, uh, car. What were you doing in his car? No. That was Birdy's car. Yeah, but you were with him. No. I was waiting for Birdy and then he came out. Oh, you were... You were waiting for Birdy and then he came out. Now it's making total sense. This is one of your crushes, isn't it? Has he done anything to you? He has, hasn't he? You don't know what you're talking about, Frances. You think you know everything about me, but you don't know anything. I know one thing, I know you pester people. You pursue them and you haunt them and you... You've gotta stop before something terrible happens. Get out of here. No. Not until I'm finished, and I have... Something else to say. I want you to move into the house with me. No. Yeah, how unexpected. Look, I just... I can't... I can't do it alone anymore. I need... I need full-time help. I wanna offer Mr. Mackey the apartment... And I want you in the house with me. What? What's so funny? All right. Frannie? Frannie? Anybody home? Surprise! Happy birthday! Jesus Christ. Happy birthday!

I mistook you. Don't ever do it again. And my name isn't Steve Bell either. So, whatever you have got saved for him, don't lay it on me. Okay? I was wondering about my pay. Why, are you leaving? I was thinking about getting drunk. Who is it? - Um, have you eaten yet? - There's some sauce left. Um, I... It's okay. Thanks. I could put some spaghetti under it for you. I'm not hungry, Martha. Thanks anyway. You writing? Yeah. My, uh, bill. So, why are you mad? Uh, I'm not, I'm not mad, Martha. Then look at me. Why won't you talk to me? Come on, you can tell me what's wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you. You... You... You're just fine. It's... It's just what's goin' on here. It's gotta stop. You gotta forget about what happened the other night... It was a mistake, it should never have happened. You understand me? I don't want to hurt you, Martha. You don't hurt me. I... I was drunk. But that's all right. No, it's not all right, and it's not going to be all right. Look, Martha, I... I... I can't be what you want me to be. I can't be there for you. You just... You can't depend on me. I could love you. Don't even say that. Don't... Don't think that. Do you... Do you understand? I want to be with you, so that's what I want. You just want the same fucking thing we all want. Hmm? What the hell is wrong with that? You just want this? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And this? Mm-hmm. Oh, Martha. Get out. What? Get... Get out. Just... Just get, get out! What? What? Just get out. Get out. Get the fuck outta here! Cleaners. Birdy Dusser, please. She's not in today. She's home sick. Finally. Birdy, finally. Ha-ha! Good one! Here I am. Throw it to me. Come on! Yeah! Sorry. Oh. Come on, get it! Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Sorry. Here you go! Birdy? Birdy? Birdy? Birdy. Birdy... Oh! Oh! Jesus Christ. What the hell are you doing here? Birdy, I need to talk to Birdy. Well, she's not here. She's at work, so you'd better leave. Go on, get outta here. Don't lie to me. I called there and they said she was here. Yeah, that's what they're supposed to say, Martha. Don't you get it yet? She doesn't want you botherin' her anymore. Now go on, get the hell outta here. Bothering her? Yeah, bothering her. Like this. Like, you just walk in here... Like it's your own house. I need to tell her something, 'cause she can help me. She doesn't want to help you, Martha. She's tired of helping you. There's no percentage in it. Don't you get it? You're a pain in the ass. Now come on, get the hell outta here! No! No! That's because you lied to her! I'm gonna tell her the truth about the money, Getso, 'cause I saw you take it and I saw you with Mercy. Nothing that you can do to me is gonna stop me from telling her the truth. Well, you already told her, Martha, and she doesn't seem really interested, does she? Let go! Jesus Christ, will you just get out of here and stop bothering people. I'm not bothering people! Bothering people! Getso, I'm not bothering people! Cut it out! Will you just... I am not bothering people! Will you just stop... I'm not bothering people! I'm not bothering people! I'm not bothering people! Getso! Martha. What are you... Ah, Jesus Christ. What the fuck did you do to me? Well... Uh? Will you just give me a hand here. For what? Oh, God. Martha, give me a hand here. Why? You have my glasses? Oh, what the fuck is goin' on here? My glasses. What? What did you do to me? What? Don't be scared. Don't be frightened. Okay, Getso? It's okay. Okay. Hey! Okay. Okay. Listen... What? Are you still here? It's okay, Getso. Getso, it's okay now. Don't be frightened, okay. Help me, Martha. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Dad, that's okay. How is she? They're bringing her down now. You okay? No, I'm not okay. You know Mr. Mackey. Are they gonna grant bail? Nope. She didn't do it. She couldn't have done this. Frannie, there's something else. She was examined by a prison doctor, and she's pregnant. She doesn't know yet, and I thought maybe you'd wanna tell her. Where are your glasses? Where are her glasses? She can't see without her glasses. Will you go get her fucking glasses! It's okay. It's not okay. What I did is really bad. It's really bad, Frances... Yeah. Very bad. It's bad. I did bad. You're right. You're right. But we think we understand why it happened. No, I don't think so. It's very bad. It's... I'm disgusting. I've done terrible things. The doctor that examined you told us... You're going to have a baby. You're going to have a baby. This is the time for absolute honesty. You can't protect anyone's reputation. What matters now is you, Martha. Do you understand? No, what matters is the baby. Yes, the baby matters. Look, you've got to listen to me. You've got to concentrate, Martha. Please! It may be hard for you to tell us what happened, but you've got to do it. If Getso raped you, you have a chance of getting off. If that happened, you have to tell us. Are you hearing what I'm saying? Did he force you that day you left your clothes in his car? No. If you did this because you were in danger, because he was hurting you, you can get off. Martha, look at me. Look at me. A man forcing a woman to have sex with him against her will... Is a way of hurting her. Nobody forced me. Martha... Do you understand that you could go to prison for the rest of your life for this? Do you understand that? But if you... If you agree to have an abortion, I think I can convince a judge or a jury that it was self-defense. There doesn't even have to be a trial. All you have to do... Is say he raped you once before and he was trying to do it again. He didn't rape me. That never happened. Well, made love to you then. Look, somebody did. You're going to have a baby. You don't have to lie, Martha. I don't lie. I know you don't. I know you... Oh, God. Oh. Hey, Frances. Right this way. Here you go. How you doin', kid? Better. If there's a God up there, he's gotta be laughin'. We are out here, and you're in there. I should have left when I said I was gonna leave. None of this would have happened. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. And I just came to tell ya that I'm leavin', because that's what I always do. No, you can't go. Martha, don't... No, you have to take care of the baby. Martha. Didn't you hear what Steve Bell said? They want to put you away for the rest of your fucking life! You have to stay and take care of the baby. You and Frances can do it together. Don't you get it? Don't you understand? This isn't a fairy t... This isn't a fairy tale, Martha. We don't all get to live happily ever after. You can't have this baby! You have to say that Getso raped you, or they're gonna think you killed him for no reason at all. But I did. Okay, now listen to me. You have to say that Getso... Attacked you in the car the day you left your packages. No. He was drunk, he took off your glasses, you couldn't see anything. And after the whole thing, you were just... You were so ashamed that you couldn't tell anybody, right? So this morning you went to Birdy. She wasn't there. And he tried again. He came at ya. He... He was naked, and you couldn't take any more. Why do you want me to say all these things? So that you can go home to Frances. I know, but they're all lies. What difference does it make, Martha? Sometimes we have to tell lies just to get to the truth. Look at me. What am I? I'm a liar. I'm a... I'm a coward. I'm a bully. I'm just a fucking drunk, Martha. I'm no different from Getso. No, you are. You have to stay and take care of the baby, Mac. I won't ever tell them that it's yours. Okay? No matter what they do to me, I will never tell anybody. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I don't care. Yeah, look, one of them has to be the best criminal lawyer in the state. Look, tell him I need this, will you? I mean, does he understand the situation here? Okay. Well, good, then call me. I'm gonna be here all night. Okay. Bye. Oh, God. What is it? What's wrong? It's funny how you have to keep losin' things... Just to learn that you really wanted them. What? It's me. She's protectin' me. It's my baby. I was drunk and... Martha. Yeah. It's all... True. There was no trial. Martha had done it. It was that simple. No, that goes there. I can see. When the doctors and lawyers and judges were through, she ended up in a nice-enough place. She has friends. They seem to take good care of her. Where is the yellow bird piece? Mar... Martha's got it. I don't have it. You're the one that is hiding pieces, EJ. Honey, I don't have nothin'. Oh, get real. Martha, are you ready? Thank goodness. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. Don't finish it all without me. Yeah, we will, we will. Thank you. Hey, Martha. Hey. Wanna get somethin' to eat? Yes, we'll get something to eat. Stay together. Okay, okay. Daniel said we could play... Hi, Martha. Go ahead. Mackey left town for a while, but six months later he'd rented a small place near the lake. He wanted to come with me to visit Martha. He comes all the time now. It's your daddy. Look! Who's that? Hi! I'm coming at you! Here you are! Hi! Hey! Hey, you! Look what I found. Look! I found it. Toy. Yeah! It's a rock. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't put it in your mouth. Don't cry. It's okay. Stop... Stop her. No! It's okay. It's okay. No! It's all right. You want your bottle? Don't cry. Aw, pumpkin, come on. We'll get the bottle. What's in the bag? Oh, look at this! Look. Look. There. Oh. Shake it. Shake it. Shake it like that. Yeah. Yeah. Wanna go with me? There are those who say... Mackey raped her, that he took advantage of her. But Martha wouldn't say that. Oh, you dropped. She'd call it love. And maybe it was.
