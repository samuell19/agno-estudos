[volcano rumbling] AWAITING AN INEVITABLE DISASTER A REPORT BY WERNER HERZOG [narrator]The parts of the world. The earth began to shake everywhere, in Northern Italy, in the Philippines, worst of all in China and in Central America. In August '76, there were clear indications that the volcano La Soufrière on the Caribbean Island of Guadalupe was about to erupt. The mountain had emitted its first signs in spring that year and scientists had been flown in. Things began to take a dramatic turn towards end of August. What was expected was no ordinary eruption, but an explosion of the Hell volcano with the force of at least five or six atomic bombs. Thus, 75,000 inhabitants were evacuated from the surroundings [indistinct] the whole southern part of the island. I was immediately fascinated when I read in the newspaper that one single poor peasant living on the very slopes of the volcano had refused to be evacuated. The very same day I set out together with my two cameramen, Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein and Ed Lachman. Next day we were already in Basse-Terre on the southern tip of the island, a town of 17,000 inhabitants, which was most threatened. The place was completely deserted, but in their haste they had forgotten to switch off the traffic lights. Telephones were still working and the air conditioning and refrigerators in many houses were still on. In one house, we even found a TV set still operating. This is the police station. It was entirely abandoned. It was a comfort for us not having the law hanging around. Most of the shops had been cleared, but in frantic haste. This is a shoe shop. The silence was eerie, just a few doors banging in the wind and water dripping. Animals had taken over the streets. We came across donkeys, pigs, chickens, and especially dogs. The dogs had gone without food for days. There was no more garbage to scavenge. They had even stopped barking. We found many of them starving and the place stank of carrion. It was as spooky as a science fiction locale. This is the pier devoid of ships. [somber music] Then, the situation became very tense during the night. There was a seismic crisis marked by 1,400 tremors and shock waves within 10 hours. The mountain seemed about to explode and the last of the scientists had fled in a boat. It was said that the catastrophe was inevitable within the next few hours. [music continues] We set up an automatic camera at a distance of 25 miles which took these pictures. [gentle music] We flew over Basse-Terre by helicopter. During the flight, we got the impression that these were the last hours of this town and the last pictures ever taken of it. [music continues] The sea was full of dead snakes. They had crawled down during the night by the thousands from the mountain channels and fled into the sea where they promptly drowned. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [narrator] The quiet and deserted atmosphere of the town was so intense that we became fascinated and eager to take a look at the source of the silence, namely at the crater of the volcano itself. All along our path, we came across warning signs. The greatest danger came from toxic gases. [music continues] That day, the Army roadblocks around an area of 30 miles in diameter had been so tightened that one could not even get through with special permission. We got around the roadblocks by sneaking across country in a car. Our path took us up to nearly 4,000 feet. The volcano itself is almost 4,500 feet high. For the first time we began to get scared. Suddenly a toxic cloud of sulfur fumes ringing the mountain descended and it was all we could do to turn our car around on the narrow path. We hastily retreated a bit and waited. [music continues] A few hours later things looked better because the wind turned. We decided to carry on. [volcano rumbling softly] [narrator] We followed the electric cables that led to the seismographs of the geologists. They had been set up right on the edge of the crater. The ground was hot and rather unsteady. At the top, there were bottomless fissures from which hot sulfur fumes were pouring. We could approach from leeward and take pictures. The mountain had split 300 feet in length. [rumbling continues] Actually, we were able to film without anxiety for several hours, but as we turned back, our cameraman, Ed Lachman, discovered he had left his spectacles behind. We decided to pick them up the next day if the mountain still existed by then. The people of Guadalupe perhaps were so aware of danger because in 1902 there had been a catastrophe in the neighboring island of Martinique. [soft somber music] This is a photo of the town of Saint-Pierre in Martinique taken in 1901. There were 32,000 people living in Saint-Pierre. The town was the administrative and cultural center of the whole island. There was even a horse-drawn tram and an opera house. The town, like Basse-Terre, lay at the foot of a volcano, Montagne Pelée. Basically, the warnings emitted by the volcano were identical to those of La Soufrière. The population intended to flee, but since there was an election which had already been postponed for other reasons, the governor persuaded the people to stay. Only a few hundred left the town. All others remained. [music continues] This is a photo taken on May sixth, 1902, two days before the catastrophe. And this is the last picture taken before the catastrophe. The population had grown restless. Some of them gathered on the beach, still thinking of fleeing. [music continues] Then the next day, this here, it is an actual photo, not a painting. A dead cow in the water, and to the right in the background, hard to make out the half-sunken wreck of the Canadian ship Roraima. It had tied up to take on refugees. It sank with all hands and not one soul survived. [music continues] In the town there was practically not a single stone left standing. All was silence. The horrified rescue teams found not a living soul. The people had been charred to a cinder. 30,000 dead in all. What had happened? There had been no usual outbreak of lava. The mountain had spouted a cloud of gas in an explosion of searing flame. The whole thing could only have taken seconds. [music continues] This is a meal of spaghetti, burnt to a cinder on a plate. And here is a loaf of bread, turned into black coal. And then they found one survivor. Just one. It was a young thief, Sylbaris, who was in prison. The miracle of his survival is that he only survived because he was the baddest guy in town. There were about 60 to 70 prisoners besides him, but he was the only one that behaved so badly, continually fighting with the wardens, so that as punishment he was placed in an underground solitary confinement. When the blast of the heat struck, he threw himself to the ground and suffered severe back burns. Later he was exhibited as a sideshow attraction in an American circus and lived until 1956. Here is a photo of Sylbaris in the hospital where he suffered for several weeks. [somber music] The hours passed and the waiting began. The silence grew ever deeper and the volcano La Soufrière shrouded itself in clouds. Nobody knew whether the eruption would happen in the next few minutes or the next day, and because one could not see a thing, the fear became anonymous. [music continues] [music continues] On that day, we found the man who had refused to leave the district and two others. We had to wake him up first. [speaking French] [narrator]What's going on here? You have refused to leave the district, haven't you? [speaking French] [narrator] Yes, I am here because it's God's will. I'm waiting for my death and I wouldn't know where to go anyway. I haven't a cent. I am poor. You are waiting for death? [speaking French] Yes, and no one knows when it will come. It is as God has commanded. He will not only take me to his bosom, but everyone else. Like life, death is forever. I haven't the slightest fear. [speaking French] [narrator]Yes, because it's God's will and no one can tell when death will come. Are you afraid? Not one bit. Why not? [speaking French] God takes everyone to his bosom, not just one, not just me. He has ordained this for us. Why don't you move out? [speaking French] [narrator] Where should I go? Death waits forever. It is eternal. I am not afraid of dying. [speaking French] [narrator] Aren't you afraid? [speaking French] [narrator] No, there is not a thing you can do. Tell me about the volcano, La Soufrière. [speaking French] [narrator] Yeah, the volcano, it's always up there above us. [interviewer speaking French] [narrator] But the situation is very dangerous, isn't it? [speaking French] [narrator] Sure it is, of course it's dangerous, but I'm staying here. What difference does it make? [man and interviewer speaking French] [narrator] You know, it's really very dangerous around here. You're sitting on a powder keg. Yeah, oui. Oui, oui. Oui, oui. [speaking French] [narrator] Sure we are, but so are all of us and it's God's will. [speaking French] [narrator] That's what God said and I'm not the slightest bit worried. Not one bit. [speaking French] [narrator] Why should I leave? I would only have to come back. Where could I go? Tell me something about your life. [speaking French] [narrator]I'm at peace with myself, with what's inside me. [speaking French] [narrator] I have nothing, nothing at all, and I'm waiting for death. [speaking French] [narrator] You see, this is how I am waiting. [speaking French] [narrator] I'm waiting for a typhoon, too, that has been predicted. But I've lived through so many typhoons. They always report them beforehand. [speaking French] [narrator] Typhoons come along in August and September. I've seen quite a few in my time. [speaking French] [narrator] You're still young. You have never lived through one. [interviewer speaking French] What have you got to lose? Ah. [singing in French] [singing in French] [speaking French] [speaking French] [narrator]I am not afraid of death. Here I am and I look after the animals all the time. They have left the cattle behind, so I'm looking after them. I'm saving them. [speaking French] And if it gets much worse, if things get real bad, maybe I'll clear out today. I'd like to go and see my children again. They're in Pointe-à-Pitre. I'd like to see them again, but I'm not afraid of dying. We all have to die someday. I'm 55 now and I'm not scared anymore. We all have to die, just like that. [speaking French] [narrator] I have 15 children. One, two, three, 15 children. [speaking French] [narrator] They have left. They went to Pointe-à-Pitre. I sent them there. Where is La Soufrière, actually? Where is the volcano? Could you point it out? We can't see it. Yes, back there. Up there. Explain the situation to me. [man speaking French] [narrator] But I haven't got any instruments. I'm no specialist. I'm all on my own. There's nobody else left. It's pretty bad here. [speaking French] [narrator] Are you scared? No, I'm not scared. Why not? Why should I be? [man and interviewer speaking French] [narrator] We all have to die one day and now I'm here. [speaking French] [narrator]I'm here and I'm poor. I only have myself to look after. I could leave here. Everyone has fled. [interviewer speaking French] [speaking French] [narrator] I'm not afraid of a single thing. You can take me with you to Pointe-à-Pitre if you like, but I could also walk to La Soufrière. You see, I can get up to my house that way, but if you'll take me to Pointe-à-Pitre with you, I'll go along. [low music] [narrator]The volcano did not explode. Days came and went. The signs of a catastrophe began to diminish. After some weeks, the population began drifting back to their homes in villages and towns. It will always remain a mystery why there was no eruption. Never before in the history of volcanology were signals of such magnitude measured and yet nothing happened. [dramatic orchestral music] The volcano will probably soon be forgotten. In my memory, it is not the volcano that remains, but the neglect and oblivion in which those black people live. [somber music] [dramatic music] There was something pathetic for us in the shooting of this picture, and therefore it ended a little bit embarrassing. Now, it has become a report on an inevitable catastrophe that did not take place. [dramatic music] [gentle music]
