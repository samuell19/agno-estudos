Okay, you're recording now, yeah. Oh yeah, that's what that symbol means. Yes, that's fully charged. And this one's fully charged. I got another one that's fully charged, it's this one right here. Why are these so cheap? Did they fall off the back of a truck or something? Ah, yeah, something. Yeah, something. - All right, thank you. - Yeah. You know any good places to eat around here? Oh sorry, yeah no. I'm kinda new around here, I don't, sorry. All right cool. - I gotta go, appreciate it. - Thanks. Thanks, all right. I can't do it anymore, man. - She's bugging me again. - Mrs. Tibbs? - Mrs. Tibbs. - Are you serious? - The rat lady, again. - No. Dude, you have to go this time. I'm not doing it. - Come on, man! - Can't do it this time, no. Look, this is the last time, and I can't keep going - back and forth with her. - Just take it for me. - Just take it this one... - Look, last time. - Last time, okay. - All right, this time. - Thanks, man. - You're gonna owe. - Thanks, I owe you one. - Yeah. My humble abode. It looked so much better on the brochure. Hi, watcha grilling? Ah, hi. - What's the? - Oh, new camera. - I'm just practicing. - Oh. - And you are? - Carly, fellow guest. Zach, fellow hotel guest also. I'm grilling up some T-bones here. I've got plenty, if you're hungry. Sorry, vegetarian. They smell great, though. Thanks. All right, later Z. Hey! Hey. Can't confirm via any European website. I got the cameras. And the guy wasn't a scammer or a serial killer. That's great. People eating each other amidst this hysteria, yes some are using... This one's got all kinds of features. Night vision, slow-mo. Baby, I really have to finish this application - before my interview. - Okay. - Sorry to interrupt. - Thank you. I'm sorry, I know you don't wanna be here, just as much as me. Oh no, no, no, no. I love this place. Why, you got any money left for something better? What the hell is that supposed to mean? It's nothing. Can you turn that thing off now? Whatever you want. That's why we have 100 million rats in my room! And the fleas, I won't even start on the fleas. And I saw a cockroach there last night. A cockroach as big as this! Are you bringing them in with your bags, ma'am? Pretty good colors on this thing. Almost full screen here. Hey, Carly, new toy. That's for my new vocation. Oh yeah, you're getting into videography, right? How'd you know? Rina told me the other day. Really, what'd she say? You mind lending me a hand here? Tell me what she said. Spill it. You know, these are really heavy. And it is a long way back to the lobby. So how's the videoing coming anyway? Got a job in two weeks. Oh, Becca's wedding. - Now tell me what she said. - Becca? I thought she married that douche in college. Well, she didn't, Wyatt. Now stop changing the subject and tell me what she said. Nothing at all, just that's what you were into. Thanks for your help anyway. Oh you bastard. People make good money filming stuff? I think good enough, yeah. More than doctors? Forgot utensils. So what was in the bag? Dead girl? Live boy? New semi plus some ammo. Gotta be ready for what's coming. Yeah, that damn Obamacare again, huh? Whatever hit Europe could hit us by days end. - You know what, never mind. - No, no, no, no, no! I believe you this time. Oh my God, that reminds me, Rina and I are completely out of tin foil. Can we borrow some? Hey, no making out on the job. - She's my sister. - Yeah, like I believe that. Anyway, can you give me a back lot remote? Yeah. - Any word from boss man? - Probably still sick. - I'll check on him later. - All right. Move these back there for me? - Yeah. - Thanks. And an affordable place to stay. My charming company, and now private parking. The benefits of my friendship never cease. Yeah, yeah. Let me turn this thing off so I can thank you. Oh sorry, I didn't mean. I'm just practicing. - Do you work here? - No, I'm a friend of Wyatt's. I'm Carly. Oh, his VIPs, I'm Gloria. You know, do you mind? I just need some footage to practice editing. Is everything okay over there? My husband, he's very sick. I'm a, well, I was almost a doctor; I could take a look. - You're a doctor? - Yeah, close enough. Please, please come. Miguel He's had a fever all morning. - He's burning up. - Don't listen to her. I was fine then, I'm fine now. He's a stubborn one, huh? Do whatever you need, just - get her off my back. - Okay. Oh my God, I've never felt a fever this hot. See, I told you. Miguel, you need to go to the hospital. No! No hospital. - Miguelito, please! - No! She's no doctor. Get out. Get out! Okay, okay. - I'm sorry he's... - Let me get this. - I'm sorry. - Please don't! Wait, please! Rina, this is what I wanted to show you. I can't decide if this is the absolute worst time to give this to you or the absolute best. As Wyatt would say, "Don't let the size fool you. "It'll get the job done." A job that should've been done a long time ago according to my mother and your mother and, everyone we know. Except of course, the bigot wing of my family. Anyway, the delay isn't for lack of effort. I've been trying to create the perfect moment to ask you to match this perfect ideal I had in my head. And nothing is ever good enough, and nothing ever will be. And I finally realized that it doesn't matter how I ask you because the perfect moment comes after when you say yes. And that line will liven things up later, if you know what I mean. Which you never do, because you are impervious to sexual innuendo. It's one of the many things I love. - Hey, babe. - Hey. - What were you doing? - Not much. What happened? Simon and Stigler called, and they wanted somebody with more experience. Three years at a firm 10 times their size isn't enough? Yeah, well they hired a guy with four. And his parents play golf with one of the partners, apparently. I'm sorry. Babe, can you, can you run out and grab some more aspirin? I'm just really, I'm gonna go take a shower. Yeah, I didn't realize we were out. Okay. - Be right back. - Thank you. You're disgusting. If you're not gonna do it, just forget about it. Just because it was a pizza. I'm all the way out there before I realized. - What's going on? - Nothing. Doesn't look like nothing. I said it was nothing. You mind if I check? Check what? Yeah, still going. You left that thing on? You surprised me when you came back before. I forgot to turn it off. Do you think I haven't noticed the weight loss? I told you what it was. Yeah, we don't own a yoga mat, Rina. You don't need a yoga mat to do yoga. I thought we were done with this. I don't wanna talk about this. Rina? This isn't working, Carly. - What's not working? - All of it. We just need time to adjust. We don't have anymore time. Look at where we are. You said it wasn't that bad. I was trying to cheer you up. Well it worked. I'm glad you think that this is funny. I did not mean that as a joke. For once. - When we moved... - When we got kicked out, - is that what you mean? - You said that we would get through this together like always. Yeah, I know I did. But? I don't know, Carly. I'm just, I'm tired, okay? Of all of it; with both of us not working, it's too much. It's just a bump. Carly, maybe it's better if we just... What is it? - Shit, it's Gloria. - Who? The maintenance guy's wife I met in the back lot. Can you hand me that camera? - You're still recording? - Just give it to me! - Hurry! - You better delete all - that other stuff. - Yeah, I promise I will. Help me! Help me please, help me! Gloria! Doctor, doctor please help me. Oh please! My Miguel, he was right behind me! What's going on? Oh my God, you're bleeding! The devil has my Miguel! You need to take her inside and call the police. - Yeah, what about you? - I'll be right behind you. Can you turn that damn camera off? And let that abusive asshole get away with it? - No! - Carly... Just go inside, I'll be right behind you, okay? I'm just gonna say be careful. Oh, okay thanks. Where the hell is everybody? What the fuck? What the hell? Anybody here? Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit! Rina, open the door! He's gonna break the damn door down. Carly, where the hell did you go? I went to go get Wyatt, to get that guy fired. Please, here he's probably employee of the month. He's the only employee; there's nobody out there. It's like The Twilight Zone episode. Are the cops on their way? No, everything is dead. You couldn't get a signal? I told you everything was dead, didn't I? Rina, please! What's he doing? God, he's getting through! Miguel! Everybody okay in there? Wyatt, you killed him. He was gonna eat you, Carly, or worse. So wound him, let the cops... The cops aren't coming, it's chaos out there. - Oh my God! - Get back! Wyatt, what are you doing? - Jesus! - I'm sorry. It's just that they can still bite when they're dead dead. One bite and you're done. - Any of you been bitten? - No, nobody! Wyatt, what the fuck are you doing? She's infected, Carly. She'll turn, try to eat you and anything she can get her hands on, I have seen it. She looked fine to me considering. She's not; she'll be dead within the hour. Then she'll be hungry, I heard about it on the radio before there was contact. This thing's already recorded one questionable homicide. What are the cops gonna think about two. - Huh? - Okay. There are no more cops. I'm doing this to save you. Wyatt, stop this. What the hell is wrong with you? Rina, you believe me, don't you? She's gonna turn. They weren't talking about it on the news because the god-damn government! But it's here from Europe. They said it wasn't, but it is. Even if it wasn't paranoid bullshit, there would be a way to help somebody who's been bitten. There is. No! Get inside. Kill her before she turns. - And lock the damn door! - Wait, Wyatt! Carly! What the fuck? - Get her, Rina. - God, no, just stay back! Carly! - Gimme that. - What's he doing? - I got it. - Gimme that. Carly, what the fuck just happened? I don't know, babe, but I got it all. When this is over, people are gonna wanna see what happened. I don't care about other people. Did her husband seriously just turn into a... No, no, no, no, zombies can't unlock doors. Zach was still talking. There's gotta be some other explanation. He was possessed! Oh God, oh baby, you scared the shit out of me. I guess I have that effect on people. Must've been a temporary outage. Dammit, my Miguel Gloria? - Gloria? - Miguel God, it looks bad. Here, Rina you hold this. Are you sure you're okay to do this? Yeah. This is Carly Mayweather and Rina Schultz. It's June 17th, 2015. We're examining the wound of Gloria... - Menez. - What are you doing? Giving an official report. We're examining the wound of Gloria Menez, who was bitten by her husband less than an hour ago. The wound shows signs of infection despite very little incubation time. Gloria, can you tell us exactly what happened? - Yes, he was... - Miguel Menez? What, you said you wanted it official. Thank you, counselor. Miguel took a nap in the shed after you left. He refused any pills, he just wanted to sleep. I check on him every five minutes. I'm sorry, Gloria, I shoulda warned you. I'm gonna clean it, okay? And then I'm gonna wrap it; it's gonna hurt. Just hold on to Rina's hand, she can take it. So, go on about Miguel. Yeah, he was getting hotter and hotter. He just wanted to sleep and oh, the devil was taking his soul. Gloria, just tell us exactly what happened, okay? Only what you saw. Was he bitten by anybody? No, he didn't have any bites. He just slept and when he awoke, my Miguelito wasn't there. He just wanted to eat and his eyes were yellow. It was, we were celebrating our anniversary today. And we were gonna go out, the first time in two years. I'm almost done here. Thank you, doctor. And you, Rina, are you sisters? No. Do you work together? Oh God, I could never work with her. Really, you got that right. No, I'm a lawyer, she's the doc, - well, was a doctor. - In training. We're partners. Oh! Married? There we go. There you go. I don't want to go like Miguel did. Please don't let them take me, please! No, no, no, Gloria, we're not gonna let that happen. We're gonna take you to the hospital, okay? Oh please! I wanna go as me with my soul intact. All right, Gloria, let's see this. Okay, okay. No internet, no cell, no problem. And you wanted the tote bag. Okay, this one time you were right. Oh, please tell me you got that? End of days, rapture is upon us. Oh, we have all been deemed unworthy. I knew this day would come. Pre-marital sex, abortions, stem cells, homosexuals! Okay, new one. I had no choice, I shot it in the chest. One went down and stayed down. But the other popped right back up and kept coming. We aren't leading with an according to Hoyle's on this, but the head is the only sure way. They'll eat anything but their own, because they prefer the living... Is it Wyatt? I can't see. Give me the camera. Get up, get up! I've seen terrible things. My husband, he was attacked. And I, well, I did what I had to do. You shouldn't hesitate, but you will. We all will, trust me though... Oh. This is it. Wow, this really is the end. No, no, no, no, it can't be. - Gloria, Gloria. - Oh fuck, Gloria! Take this, take this. Pulse weak. She's on fire. Gloria? You have to do it before they turn, so they don't come back. Oh God, this is actually happening like Wyatt said. She's gonna turn into one of those things. No, I won't let that happen. She's gone, Carly. There's nothing we can do to help her. No! Dammit! We have to honor her wishes. - No! - Look when she comes back... - If she comes back. - When she comes back she'll be just like her husband. You're asking me to kill an innocent woman. She's not gonna be an innocent woman... You're asking me to do something I do not want - to do, again! - Again? I did not ask you to stay in med school, Carly. You were, yeah, you hated me when I quit. There it is right there. We need to deal with this problem right now, right here. That's not. Will you show me her eyes? Oh God. Baby, I'll do it, okay? You don't even know how. Well, I'll figure it out. You just, you, get the jugular or the aorta, right? And you don't even know where a good knife is. It's the government, program Locust. Think about it, I've been saying it for years. The government's been trying to develop super soldiers since 1932: MK-Ultra, Project Blackbook, Paperclip. All dismal fucking failures. Then Locust, they sure as shit succeeded. And this thing comes 'cause this fucking administration just releases it... Jesus, how can we tell if anything we hear on this thing is even true? Yeah, there should be an emergency signal on some channel if those assholes can get through. - Do not go to... - Did he say Mercy General? Mercy General; if you aren't killed by the eating machines, looters will get you. I hope to God someone out there gets this message and stays away. My fever's increasing. I'm feeling hungry. Sounds amenable. - I - don't have long now. Shoot in a coma, and then it's too late. I've rigged a way to put this on a loop. So you are probably listening to a dead man right now. Definitely a dead man. This is Doctor Harold Rittmeyer signing off. This is Doctor Harold Rittmeyer, pediatric oncologist at Mercy General. Nobody I've come across knows anything. I have no idea what's causing this, not that it matters. It's here and we have to deal with it. We have a rapidly spreading infectious disease. You don't even have to be bitten; I wasn't and I've got it. Lucky me! There has to be an alternative infection vector. That's the only way this thing could sustain itself. If the infected get you, they eat you. There's no coming back to continue the spread. If they bite you and you somehow survive... - She's seizing! - Jesus! Help me hold her! Anyone who is infected can not return. Kill them. - Rina, what is... - Let me go! - No, got you. - Stop! Nope, it'll be too messy. Gimme that. If this isn't the right decision, I hope anybody who sees this can forgive me. No! It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got it. Rina, wait! Oh God! Oh God, did any get on you? No! Oh God! Should we say something? Oh God. To whoever's watching, as you just saw, Rina got some of Gloria's blood in her eyes and mouth. Gloria, she definitely turned. We rinsed Rina's eyes out as best we could. I mean, we don't even know if blood contact is infectious. It might not even be a vector. We rinsed it out; she'll be fine. And she's not... She'll be fine. You know, it's the rest of the world that I'm worried about. I ran through the dial on the radio again. Doctor Rittmeyer is still coming through on repeat. But staticky, like there's some sort of interference. We lost the rest, even the Mexican station, which I really wouldn't mind right about now. Just, the disease, this illness, if there's one thing I learned at Mercy it's that no matter how hard you try, there's some people you just can't save. And that fact killed me, fucking killed me. That's not going to be Rina. I've gotta do something to help her. Wyatt's got a whole arsenal in that storeroom. Maybe he'll have some medicine there. Where the hell did Miguel go? Carly? You're supposed to be sleeping. Where are you going? I'm going to Wyatt's storeroom, just to get a few things. Does that mean you have a plan? Yeah, don't I always? Carly! Movies! Sorry Mrs. Tibbs. Carly? SIT-REP, they'd want a SIT-REP. This is Lieutenant Wyatt Fremont. Army, 38th Infantry, honorable discharge 2012. Not sure how many of these things are active. I've tagged seven, eight. I'm bingo on ammo; headed for a resupply. Shit! It's one of them smart bastards. God-damn PREGO. Seen a lot of 'em sniff the air like that. Is that how they hunt? Jesus, I need a shower. Lost the last contact; don't know where he's hiding. Almost back to my weapons cache. What the fuck? Son of a! - Wyatt? - Carly? - Oh God! - Carly. I thought you were dead. Take more than an apocalypse to kill me. Oh God. Where's Rina? - She's been bitten? - No. But I wanna get her some antibiotics. Do you have anything here? No, not anymore. All right, I wanna go to Mercy then. - It's been overrun. - It doesn't matter. Will you please help me? Are you gonna help me clean this place up? It was like this when I got here. They didn't get everything. Oh, that's your department. Is this thing still working? Wyatt? Oh what the fuck? Rina, Rina! Rina, are you in there? Carly! - Get inside! - Rina, are you in there? Rina, Rina! Carly! Maybe she's in a coma. It's dead-bolted from the inside. Rina, please! Rina, please! - I'm sick. - Rina, open the door. Just leave me before I hurt you. Baby, listen please. I can help you, you know I can. Baby, please don't shut me out this time. Rina, I know you won't do it, so I'm gonna have to do it myself. Why are you giving up when there's still a chance? Incoming, they brought friends. We're all out of chances. They're everywhere, we're trapped. No, we're not; Wyatt has a plan to get us out of here. We're gonna take his car to an Army safe point. Yeah, it's true, Rina. It's about 10 miles north of the city. They can treat me there? Oh yeah yeah, they have everything there, the works. How do you know? A Captain of mine came through on a column I have stashed. See? We can get you out of here. Just put the knife down, baby. Okay? Okay. Okay, now. I know. I don't shut you out all the time. Turn the light out. Turn it the fuck off! If we're quiet, maybe this PREGO will leave. - PREGO? - Yeah. He's one of the smart ones. Means he's eaten recently. The rest of 'em get more... This last one leaves I can definitely make it to my vehicle. - Oh, dammit! - What? My truck keys, I left them in the office. Oh, ah, that's okay. We have ours. Here, here. Oh no, somebody might see you in a Subaru. We'll wait 10 minutes and then we'll go. Okay. Okay, okay then, there's the gate. It look clear. - Carly? - Yeah? You have that remote? Yeah. Smack it. God-damn it! Hold on a second. Piece of shit. That motor's blown. That gate's not opening any time soon. Where are your keys? Gone. Oh fuck! Okay, let's go. I can't, I can't do this. - I'm so tired. - You're not leaving my sight. Really wish I had my AR. Yeah, for once I agree with you. - I can't, I have to stop. - Okay, okay. Why don't we go into one of these empty rooms and Wyatt, you go to the front office and grab the keys. You sure you'll be all right on your own? Yeah, and I'll take the camera here. Okay, thank you. Wyatt, I don't want that. - I'll be quick. - Okay. Come on, here we go. - Carly? - Yeah. Not that one. Okay. There's no one there, go. Come on. You got it. You got it. Okay, okay. Okay, you got it. Okay, okay. This, got it. Baby, come on, sit down. Solves that. - How you feeling? - Never better. You were about to do it back there, weren't you? Do what? Break up with me. Yeah. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Carly, what are you doing? - I know, I know. This is absolutely the worst time ever. Rina... I knew you were special from the moment I met you. At Johnny's art show. We stayed for hours and nobody else showed up. I've been meaning to, I've been meaning to do this for a really long time now. And I just couldn't find the time, since we haven't been very good. - Yes. - Sorry. Your timing is the absolute worst, but my answer is still yes. I know things have been bad, but it's just a bump. - Right? - Yeah. - I love you. - I love you, baby. Always. Are you gonna give me my ring - or what? - Yes. Here. - There. - Baby, you have to promise me that if we can't get help in time, if it's too late, that you'll do it, okay? - What, no, no, no... - Baby, you promise me or I won't accept this. - Okay? - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Promise. Say it. I promise. If you put that back on. - You stay here, okay? - No, don't. Wyatt? Rina, run! Rina? Rina? Baby, baby, baby! Oh God. Come on, come on! Go, go, go, go! What happened, what happened? Twisted my damn ankle, they knocked my weapons away. They were working together. Do you have the key, please tell me? Okay, Rina. Oh Jesus, that's Zach. Is it? Damn, PREGO bastard I was telling you about. Looks like someone else already got to him. Oh God! No! God, get him off! Get him off! - Ah! - Keep it up, keep it up. Keep it up, keep it up. Oh God! No, too tight, too tight! Hold it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up. Don't take this the wrong way. No, what? I can't believe that son of a bitch was playing opossum. Come on, we gotta get out in the open. - Rina, come on. - Mother fucker! Come on, come on. Come on, sweetheart. Okay, okay. He got me, oh he got me. He got me, I can't believe it. No, no, no, sit down. Down, down. What are you doing? There's a small chance we can stop the spread. Oh, no, no, you're not taking my fucking arm! If I don't, you're gonna turn. - And we don't have time! - Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! - Oh fuck, fuck, fuck. - Above the elbow or below? Fuck, fuck, fuck! All right, just like the OR. Just like the OR, are you ready? Okay, one... I'll be right back; don't touch it. Rina, Rina, up up up, baby, come on, baby. Oh come on! Wyatt, this is gonna hurt like hell, but if I don't do it, you'll bleed out. - Come on. - Just do it. Okay, okay. Wyatt, you stay with me. Wyatt? Wyatt? Hey Wyatt, stay with me. Wyatt, hey! Wyatt, you stay with me! Gonna be funny if this thing didn't record anything. Everything forgotten. Wonder how many other people recorded the end of the world by accident. Wyatt's still alive. Barely, he's lost a lot of blood. I nicked, cleaved in half an artery. A belt does not make a very good tourniquet. I sewed him up as best I could but, I don't have anything here to really help him. I , I can't wake Rina up. Soon she'll... I guess that's it then. Mom and Jess I love you. I wish I woulda taken your calls after I dropped out. I'm sorry, I just, I needed some time to figure things out. I love you guys. I hope I did the right thing in the end, made you proud of me. And mom, to answer your question, I'd want you to walk me down the aisle. I'm sorry, Wyatt. I'm so sorry. No! No! Rina. Rina? Baby? - Rina... - No, stay back! Oh God, I can feel it taking over. I'm sorry, baby, I'm so sorry. I liked your hair so much at the art show. Short with those long bangs in your eyes. That was the worst hairstyle ever in my life. No, you looked beautiful. I knew the moment you talked to me that we were gonna to be together. - Baby... - Stop it! You stay back. It hurts, oh. Baby, can you fight it? Not for much longer. You know, you never told me what you thought actually about that night. - You know how I felt. - No. You always say that. I just wanted you to sleep with me that night. I didn't realize what we had until that Thanksgiving. I don't, I can't remember. I took you to my parents' house. I wanted to confront my father once and for all. Worst decision I ever made. Hey, you don't remember? I stormed out, I left you there with them. Yeah, right, your sister. - Yeah. - She didn't think you - were coming back. - Yeah. - I remember. - Yeah. And I wasn't going to, either. And you didn't stop till you reached the state line. And you followed me the whole way. I was so mad at you. You were driving so fast on those goddamn icy roads. Yeah, and then I stopped and we both got out. And it was snowing like crazy. Yeah it was, it was the coldest day of the year. And I couldn't feel my hands. And you wouldn't let me go any further, no matter how much I pushed you away. And we slipped and fell on our asses right there in the parking lot. And you said, that anyone who was worth keeping in my life, would love me for who I am. - Like, like I do. - Yeah. That was the first time you said it to me. - And you said it back. - Yeah. God, how did we end up here, Rina? Not now, but yesterday. I don't know, baby, I'm sorry. This month was really hard. When did you stop loving me? I never. Rina? Baby. Rina? I can't do it, baby, I'm so sorry! Rina, are you in there? Hmm, the hair tuck. Rina used to do that all the time. She's still in there somewhere. Shit! Oh no. No! Baby, you don't have to. Baby, it's me. I know you're in there, baby, stop. Rina, stop! Hey baby. I hope you understand that I didn't have a choice. Neither of us did. I tried to save her. Us. I really tried. I love you so much!
