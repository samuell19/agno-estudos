MAN: BO! It's money! The root of all evil. Money! And evil men. I'll give you two examples of the men we are up against. Sir Julian Wharton. A diplomat... who sells a million pounds worth of armaments a year. You can imagine -what he's doing for peace. -MAN: And the church is-- LOVEDAY: And then there's the American. Martin J. Haslock. Oh, he's the prize of all. He has the luck, all right. The luck of the devil! He sold arms... to a group of freedom fighters in South America so that they could rebel and then he sold arms to the local government so that they could kill the rebels! A couple of million dollars in the kitty, and only about 5,000 dead. Now! Who is going to save you helpless idiots... from men like these? Who will save you? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Our organization is known to its friends as K.R.A.S.H. K-R-A-S-H. Killing, Raping, Arson, Slaughter, and Hits. All our men are experts in unarmed combat. As you see, the training is intense. The one with two eyes... is new to K.R.A.S.H. [GUNSHOT] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] MAN: [GRUNTING] [NECK BONE CRACKS] In this ring we do not bother with a count of ten. Come. I'll show you something else. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] His ability with a gun is matched only by his treachery. Each of our operatives is assigned to kill. The man just shot dead was his... assignment... and his brother. That is indeed treacherous and ruthless. Yes. Each man that reachesthe highest level in K.R.A.S.H. has these qualities. Just to keep a breast of the times, we're developing a new women's section. I take it you're impressed by our organization. No. If I can find you, so can the police. We send terrorists and assassins all over the world. The need for secrecy is both obvious and essential. With K.R.A.S.H. it is complete and absolute. LOVEDAY: I'm glad to hear it. But the fact that I'm here to employ you means that you can be found. Well, if you're not happy. I'll pay you five million to see that anyone who troublesme is eliminated. I'll have no further contact with you, but if I'm happy with your service, you'll get five million every year. You must be a very wealthy man. Determined is a better word. You see, unlike yourself, I can murder openly. I have done so and I will continue to do so. But then, I have formulated a plan for the perfect murder. Then why do you need K.R.A.S.H? So, that my work may continue uninterrupted. Frankly, your subversive operation is no more than a diversion. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Won't be long. Keep it warm till I get back. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Charles. I might have known. Does he have to interfere with my private life? He didn't exactly get you out of bed. Ah. But he did stop me getting into it. Good morning, sir. Well, Bind, what do you think? I don't know, sir. December the 8th, Martin J. Haslock, American, shot leaving Sotheby's. Died leaving five million dollars. December the 15th, Sir Julian Wharton, shot outside the Savoy. See he only left 900,000 pounds. Well, I think, sir. I think it only goes to showthat money can't buy happiness. Very funny. What other bright ideas have you got? Not very many, I'm afraid. They both died in much the same way. And they were very rich, too. The way I see it, there are too many links connecting the two victimsfor it to be simple coincidence. Haslock, the American, was a pretty valuable friend. He helped us with some of our best economic operations in South America. And Sir Julian Wharton? He was one of Britain's key negotiators in the international money market. Each of these men was in high finance, and valuable to Britain. We've been instructed to get to the bottom of it. Start immediately. -Where? -Speaker's Corner, Hyde Park. Intelligence reports some scruffy demagogue made some particularly nasty remarks about these men. Of course, it may be sheer coincidence. See if you can dig him out of whatever hole he lives in and ask him a few questions. Right, sir. ROCKWELL: Hang on a minute, Bind. Take off your coat. -Why, sir? -ROCKWELL: Get it off! You're licensed to kill, Bind, but only with a government- issue .38. Yes, well, a .38's all very well in a lady's handbag, sir, but my 357 combat Magnums can stop an elephant at 200 yards. Yes, but we don't kill elephants, do we? True. ROCKWELL: Get rid of them. I want to see you wearing that government-issue .38 next time you enter this office. Yes, sir. Miss Martin, will you send in Agent Hudson. Good morning, Miss Hudson. Good morning, sir. ROCKWELL: This is Charles Bind. You'll be under his wing. Bind, I'd like you to meet Miss Hudson. She'll be working with you. Look after her, Bind. Like a brother, sir. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Listen to me, you fools! You rubbish, blown off the London streets. I am here to save you. You're not worth it, but I'm going to save you all the same. [INSTRUMENT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CAR REVVING] [MACHINE WHIRRING] Well, I certainly wouldn't want him to marry my sister. Even if I did have one. You say you traced the car? ANNA: Mm-hm. Soda? Yes, please. Uhhh! -Say when. -I'm soaking! Oh. Yes, well, you'd better get out of that dress. You'll catch pneumonia. [WARDROBE CLOSES] -ANNA: Oh! -Here. Better put this on. Belonged to my older brother. Oh! [DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN] [DOOR CLOSES] We better get down to business. You say you traced the car. Yes. It belongs to a Mr. Arthur Loveday. Wonder why he gives lifts to down-trodden tramps? Loveday. Loveday. It's a name I seem to remember. Probably in the Financial Times. He owns a group of companies called Teen Toys. You know, they make Speedo racing cars, Macro Models, that type of thing. Quite a success story, really. He started making playthings in a garden shed about 18 years ago. And now he owns four factories and nets about 20 million a year. Shouldn't be too hard to find him. I've already found him. [DOOR OPENS] Oh. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Fascinating little trick, Charles! Yes. This bulletproof wall is activated whenever a gun is pointed at me. Wonder where our unfriendly Mr. Loveday lives? I know. Wayland Park. It's a huge kind of a shack in a couple of acres of land near Winchester. We'd better pay him a visit, then. Oop. [CAR REVVING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [FOOTSTEPS] Mr. Bind, sir. Hello, Mr. Bind. LOVEDAY: I was expecting you tocome calling one of these days. I'd heard you were looking for me. I gather you weren't quite expecting me. BIND: I must admit it hadn't occurred to us that our Hyde Park orator was only a fancy-dress tramp. No, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, Mr. Bind. I'd have looked pretty eye-catching standing up there preaching in a black silk dressing gown, now, wouldn't I? [LAUGHING] Do sit down. Now, what can I do for you? Some weeks ago, in one of your perorations, you made some scathing references to two men, Martin J. Haslock and Sir Julian Wharton? All of them true. May be. But soon afterwards, each of them got a bullet through his skull. My employer's interested to know who killed them and why? We were thinking perhaps you might know more about it than we do. Well, Mr. Bind, in a manner of speaking, you might say that I killed them. In what "manner of speaking"? Let's just say that I killed them. -BIND: How? -Ah, now that would be telling. I see. LOVEDAY: I don't think you do. Haslock and Wharton were both very nasty characters. Somebody had to kill them. Now you tell me something. Why are you so concerned about them? Well, I just have an old-fashioned objection to murder. Hmm, that's very unreasonable of you. I thought I was doing theBritish government a good turn. I think of it all as gathering death duties. To my knowledge, the government doesn't allow its official tax collectors to use firearms. Somehow, Mr. Loveday, I don't think they'd approve of unofficial use of them, either. They'll never get a modern Britain that way. Do you mind telling me why you killed them? Certainly. I don't like rich men. Myself excepted. And there were good reasons to particularly dislike those two. And that's all there is to it? LOVEDAY: Yes, Mr. Bind. That's all there is to it. Except, of course, I haven't finished yet. Oh, you mean you've got more people you don't like? LOVEDAY: Exactly. And you've arranged for them to leave the riches of the world? That's right. They'll suddenly go into the cold like-- BIND: Haslock and Wharton. Do you think it's wise, Mr. Loveday? I mean, you do know we're not going to like it. Mm, then that's too bad. I'm afraid I've already made my plans. So, you could always try to stop me. I've never minded a bit of healthy competition. It helps to keep one on one's toes, I always think. BIND: I will stop you, Mr. Loveday. You think so? I warn you, Mr. Bind, I don't box with gloves on. Neither do I. Well, then it should be a nice fight. I'd like you to meet Stormy Weather. [GRUNTS] LOVEDAY: Don't trumped with a queen, sweetheart. Hello, Stormy. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [RIPPING CLOTHES] Uh, frightfully sorry, sir. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, the operation is legal nowadays. Oh, by the way, I'm taking a trip across the Channel the day after tomorrow. I have a little uh, business in Boulogne. My kind of business? Your kind of business. Who's the victim? He is. Oh, I should explain. I'm collecting a kind of high class rogues gallery. Loveday's Finest Living Dolls. Actually... these... are dead ones. Do you recognize them? I can take a guess. Martin J. Haslock and Sir Julian Wharton. Right first time, Mr. Bind. And then there will be this one. And who's that little fellow? Well, he hasn't been finished yet. But when he is, he'll be the spitting image of one Arturo Benvenuti. A very bad man. Benvenuti. An Italian financier. That's right. A retired Mafia chief. But very respectable, nowadays. A bit of a comedown after the others, isn't it? I suppose it is. But I've never been snobbish about murder. Thanks for the little chat, Loveday. You're quite a joker. In the games I play, the joker always wins. Goodbye, Mr. Bind. Extraordinary, Bind, extraordinary. You say this fellow Loveday admitted he organized these killings? Why? I don't know, sir. Why does he regularly turn up in Hyde Park dressed for a tramp's ball? He's eccentric, that's what he is. Eccentric. What did you make of him? Well, he seemed intelligent. Deadly. And a little crazy. He also has a fondness for sex-changed transvestite killers. No, no. I mean, did you believe him? Well, I don't know, sir. He's tried to kill me twice already. Perhaps he just doesn't like having his photograph taken. [LAUGHS] Hm. That's very funny. Take off your coat. -Why, sir? -Get it off! That's better, Number 1. He's playing games with us. He's one of the wealthiest men in the country. Obviously, he's a joker besides. Where's his motive? If I live long enough, I'll ask him. ROCKWELL: He's not our type, not our type at all. And this trip to Boulogne, by channel ferry! My God, Bind. And this next so-called plan of his. Gunning down Benvenuti, well, I mean, that shows he's all a hoax, doesn't it? Does it, sir? Isn't he prominent in the financial world these days? Yes, but he always has an army of trigger-happy bodyguards around him. Well, Loveday may not be a very convincing villain, but he's the only one we've got. Do you want to take this trip to Boulogne? I'm still not sure about him. Anyway, what have we got to lose? In your case, buy nothing. In my case, I have to answer for your expenses. You really sure about Loveday? Or is it just the thought of a cruise with Miss Hudson that appeals to you? Cruise, sir? Hour and a half across the channel? Thank you, sir. Don't thank me. Just come back with something better than you have so far. Yes, sir. Oh, there's one more thing. I'd be grateful for a full research job on Loveday's background. Won't be time before we leave. All right, I'll send you a cable. -Thanks.-ROCKWELL: Bon voyage, Number 1, have fun. But not too much fun. [THUD] ROCKWELL: That's a Magnum. Yes, well, lot of elephants in Boulogne, sir. [LAUGHS] All right. [DOOR CLOSES] [WATER RUSHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Over here, Mr. Bind. My dear Bind, I'm delighted to see you! It's going to make this little trip so much more interesting for me. Yes, well, uh, I do think it's a little bit early for shipboard romances. -They friends of yours? -Ah, yes, you haven't met my girls, have you? Let me introduce you. It's, uh, Krissie and Paula Williams. Or Paula and Krissie Williams, it makes little difference. The girls, in a way, are learning the business. Yes, well, uh, I can see they're working hard at it. Well, I uh, never do things by halves. Do sit down, Mr. Bind. What will you have? A scotch on the rocks? My mother always told me not to drink whiskey before noon. Make it a large brandy. A large brandy, please. And that's what money buys, Mr. Bind. Instant service and a bow that's six inches lower. What else does it buy? Anything you want. Women, war or peace, traitors, even loyalty. Doesn't it, girls? And... murder. And murder, Mr. Bind. Let's stroll, shall we? We were talking about murder. Were we? I thought we were talking about money. You won't stop me, you know. It's all part of a plan. A well-thought out, carefully organized plan. That's how I made my money. You see, you don't make a few million and keep it by just holding out your hand and waiting for the pennies to drop from Heaven. You plan. You think faster and better than your competitors. Then you always win. How about you, Mr. Bind? Do you always win? In my job, I have to. That's true. It's not much of a game for losers. You know, in a funny sort of a way, I almost hope that you will survive the competition I've arranged. Mm, I don't think you will, though. Competition? What competition? Well, it's more of a race, really, between a few of the crew members to see which one kills you first. I've put up a prize of 10,000 pounds. No consolation prize for the losers, I'm afraid. -Friendly. -Oh, don't take it personally, Mr. Bind. Either I stop you or you stop me. You know, you could do with a shave, Mr. Bind. What's it to be, sir? Shave, please. Certainly, sir. Short day. Mr. Bind, isn't it? BIND: How do you know my name? A Mr. Loveday asked me to look after you specially. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [LAUGHS] BIND: Had enough? [GRUNTS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] That was a close shave. What's Rockwell's news on Loveday? I was just gonna read it. Oh, a waterbed! [LAUGHS] Yes. It's mine. I had it installed in case we ran aground. -[GAPS] -Oh, dear, I'm so sorry. I was just moving it out of the way and look what happened. [CHUCKLES] You'd better slip into something dry. Like your skin. Yes, Charles. [CLEARS THROAT] "Subject: Arthur Loveday. Purpose: General Enquiry. Full name: Arthur Ebenezer Loveday, born 1923, son of Thomas Loveday, carpenter, and Marjorie Loveday, housewife. Mother killed in car accident in 1944. Father died in prison after being arrested on a theft charge. Arthur's education limited to eight years state education. According to teacher, a quiet boy, with average ability. Very religious. From 1936 to 1941 apprenticed to Jones Beamish, furniture manufacturers, as a cabinet maker. Joined the army in 1941. Returned to Britain in 1946. From 1946--" Oh! -Can I help? -No, thank you. All right. Uh, "from 1946 to 1948 was a tramp! Came into contact with a religious society in Manchester. Made model kits for children working from a small garage, then started building them professionally. Business flourished and expanded from the start. Now owns several factories all over the world and lives in style. Travels a great deal by sea. Favored destinations: New York, Nice, and Berne. Gives away large sums to charities, friendship societies, religious groups, and the RSPCA. Rockwell, Head of MI5 Ministry, Whitehall, London, SW 1." Well, what do you make of that lot? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. Would you repeat it? Oh, forget it. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] MAN: [SCREAMS] Well, at least he had guts. Yes. And they're all over the deck. You've just saved me 10,000 pounds. You know, sometimes I think you're working for my bank manager. Three down, none to go, Loveday. No, I wouldn't say that. Incidentally, the next time we meet, you must introduce me formally to Miss Hudson. Charming girl. I think I might have got on very well with her, if only circumstances had been different. [CLEARS THROAT] At least I won't have to cut my toenails this Saturday. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Got a light, darling? You're very switched on, sweetie. You're not by any chance a friend of Mr. Loveday's? [GROANS] You're trying to bit my jugular vein. Playful, aren't you? Oh, you're very tasty, Mr. Bind. Just another little nip. I don't mind being eaten, darling, but not like this. [WOMAN GROANS] BIND: Huh, Fangs for the memory. Fangs ain't what they used to be. [LAUGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] What have you come as? I'm the Clean Shave Kid. You got about 20 seconds to live. I don't believe it! -[GUNSHOTS] -[CLEAN SHAVE KID GROANS] BIND: This ship just wasn't big enough for the both of us. Two days and he hasn't left the hotel. Neither have the girls. He must have come to organize Benvenuti's killing. In order to do that, he's got to make contact with somebody. Do you think his contact man might be one of the hotel staff after all? ANNA: No. They've all been thoroughly checked and they're very clear. Then he must have outside help. I wish Rockwell would get a new photocopier. This stuff from the post officeis practically unreadable. BIND: [CHUCKLES] What's in old Loveday's mail today? Oh, same usual old things. A couple of bills. A letter of thanks for a donation from the RSPCA. A letter asking for a donation from the Dog Lovers League. [SIGHS] I tried to warn Benvenuti. ANNA: What did he say? Thanked me very politely. Said it was nice to have strangers worrying about his health. I think he thoughtthe whole thing was a huge joke. I'm beginning to wonder myself. -Got you. -Oh! Charles, do you have to do that? BIND: I'm sorry, darling. But in that shirt, I just can't control myself. [GRUNTS] Why don't you, uh, slip into something more comfortable? Of course I will, because I'm meeting Loveday in 10 minutes and he's going to show me the sights of Boulogne. [THUDS] ANNA: This looks like the place Charles came to see Mr. Benvenuti. LOVEDAY: Really! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [GROANS] ANNA: Oh, dear. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] An aperitif, sir? Yes, why not? I can recommend the Chambery. It's an excellent vintage. Sounds splendid. Chambery for Madame and Scotch for myself. -Certainly, sir.-Oh, make that a double whiskey -for the gentleman. -WAITER: Double, Madame. -Thank you. -Why? ANNA: Benvenuti is dead. Don't look now, but Mr. Mastermind is coming our way. Good evening, Miss Hudson, Mr. Bind. Talk of the devil. Oh, come now, Mr. Bind. I'm wearing a halo today. I got it from making the world a little bit cleaner. Oh, do you mind if I sit down? [CHUCKLES] Feel free. We were just talking about Benvenuti. Oh, you've heard, then? Oh, that's a pity. Now I wanted it to be a surprise. Oh, it was. -Well, sort of. -LOVEDAY: I warned you there wasn't much point in coming. You know, if I were you, I should cut my losses and go home now. Thanks for the advice. What's this? Celebration? I give you a toast, Mr. Bind. To a clean, new world. Oh, it's a pity you're against me. A great pity. Yes. Well, that's life. LOVEDAY: I'm afraid for you, Mr. Bind, it's more like death. So, it doesn't do to be morbid, does it? [LAUGHS] No. Oh, by the way, I'm going to a health farm for a few days. This is such a tiresome business. Why don't you join me? BIND: Rockwell's going to go madwhen he finds out the price tag for one grapefruit juice a day. I'd give my right arm for a plate of spaghetti. We've only been here for two hours, Charles. Do you think Loveday's really here for a rest cure or do you think he's up to something more sinister? Well, there's no one of any importance within a radius of 25 miles, so unless he's gotvery highly powered binoculars, he won't be able to witness his handiwork from here. Besides, he'd tell us so he could have an audience. Hey, Rockwell should know we're back. Yeah. I'll give him the glad news. ANNA Hi. High enough in this place. We're to eat at Rockwell's expense. -Did you call him? -No. I thought I'd let you do it. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. MAN: Is Mr. Bind with you? Yes, he's here. It's for you. -Hello. -MAN: Is that Mr. Bind? -Yes. -MAN: I can give you some information that will get Loveday behind bars. -Can you meet me? -Any time you like. MAN: My life is in danger. I must see you. Within the hour. Hayes Wharf. BIND: I know it. [PHONE STATIC] Someone wants to sell us some information. Probably Loveday, up to one of his little tricks again. Who's to say it's not genuine? He must have some enemies. And you're number one, darling. What have I got to lose? Probably your life. True. Don't forget dinner. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] These have been delivered for you. Thank you. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] ANNA: Oh, dinner. [CHUCKLES] Uh, can you put it over there, please? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ANNA GROANS] [WOMAN GROANS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ANNA: Hmm. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [JEEP ENGINE STARTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN SCREAMING] [TIRE SCREECHING] [GUNSHOTS] MAN: Pull over. Pull over. Everybody out. [GUNSHOTS] [ENGINE HISSING] [EXPLOSION] That's what I call a warm welcome. [JEEP ENGINE REVVING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [MACHINE GUN FIRING] I knew they'd go to pieces in a crisis. Do you think it'll spoil my looks? No. All the girls will still love you. Reassure me. -Oh. -Some other time. Now keep still or you'll get antiseptic in your eye. Where were you when I needed you? I was rather busy myself. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's violence. Well, you're in the wrong job, aren't you? Oh, really? I don't mind being violent. What I hate is people being violent to me. You're still in the wrong job. I never stopped being nice to Loveday. I've been turning the other cheek so much I'm beginning to get a pain in the neck. Then why isn't the bandage around your neck? I think you should go home, Mr. Bind, and stop wasting your time following me around. Well, it's your own funeral. [LAUGHS] Get well soon. Good evening, Anna. What's with the Anna bit? Always used to be "Miss Hudson". I think he likes me. Do you know, in an odd sort of a way, I think he likes you, too. Got a funny way of showing it. Can we eat now? Thirty-six dead mercenaries? I know you're licensed to kill, Number 1, but this is ridiculous! How am I to explain the body count to the PM? Very clever of you to have a fifty caliber machine gun mounted in your car. -BIND: Yes, sir. -We probably-- we can't make a habit of it, -can we? -No, sir. You've been spending government money, Bind, and what have you got to show for it? -Bruised head, sir. -Yes. Well, you'll be for the high jump if you don't come up with the results soon. Now PM wants results, Number 1! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Right this way, sir. There he is. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] BIND: Not bad. Now it's my turn. And I was wondering when you'd turn up again. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Well, you've been practicing. -It's a good bow. -Yes. One of my factories make them. It's a new line for Christmas. Have you ever considered changing jobs? Not since I was in the army. Doesn't my present job suit me? It has no prospects. Besides, it doesn't suit me. I'd pay you well. -[ARROW THUDS] -Good shot. Are you trying to buy me off? You're a man of integrity, Mr. Bind. My organization needs people like you. Yes, well. I'm quite happy with my job the way it is. [ARROW THUDS] Where are we going next? I'm not inviting you this time. Why not? Because I happen to like you, Mr. Bind. And I don't want to have to kill you. Then why lead us right to your front door? [CHUCKLES] Hyde Park Corner? -That's a weakness of mine. -Yes. That, and blatantly admitting that you were organizing a series of murders. I'm not a young man, Mr. Bind. There are very few real pleasures left for me. One of them is outsmarting stupid policemen. Believe me, I could pile the clues so high you'd trip over them and still not get to the bottom of my plan. You'll never stop me, Mr. Bind. But we can't let you go on killing people, now can we? Did you know that my father died in prison? -Yes. -The police were too stupid to see that he wasn't a criminal, but a sick and desperate man. Desperate men, Mr. Bind, they're the ones who get thingsdone in this world. Are you flaunting your scheme of murders in front of us as a kind of retribution? No, let's just say that I enjoy the game. It's a kind of sport with me. Blood sport. And so's fox hunting. BUTLER: There's a telephone callfrom the office for you, sir. LOVEDAY: Oh, thank you. I'll take it in the study. Goodbye, Mr. Bind. [BIRDS CHIRPING] LOVEDAY: My father was out of work for five years. Uselessness ate into him like cancer. -[BEEPS] -LOVEDAY: You will select the victims when you reach the fifth stage of enlightenment. The men of wealth and corruption will always be there. -[KNOCKS ON DOOR] -LOVEDAY: I was only 10 years old when I wrote to these men-- [RECORDER STOPS] Ah, Anna. Come in. You're just in time. Take your clothes off and relax. I have some news and some food. Is Rockwell fussing about our expenses? ANNA: No. I've managed to convince him that we don't drink Champagne for breakfast. [BOTH LAUGH] Aren't you hungry? [GASPS] Ah, You look so lovely when you're wet. Oh! Oh. [CHUCKLES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Sorry, darling. All gone to the laundry. Listen to this. What is it? Conversation between Loveday and his birds over dinner in Boulogne. Cost our dear boss Rockwell £200 to have the table bugged. Would you believe, 12 solid hours of tape and not a hint of how it's done. This is the most interesting thing on it. LOVEDAY: ...begging them to give my father a job. Not one answered. When my father went to prison, it broke my heart. And I swore vengeance. You must have this kind of faith. Follow your instructions chapter and verse. -[SNAPS FINGERS] -"Chapter and verse". That's a strange way of describing their instructions. Sounds more like a religious seminar than instructions for assassins. [SCOFFS] Exactly. Do you remember when we were sifting through Loveday's mail, we found an uplifting message from the Brothers of Light. ANNA: Yeah? I'm beginning to wonder if that's the way that Loveday communicates with his organizations. ANNA: The Brothers of Light, using high-minded quotes to conceal low-minded purposes. Sounds like Loveday's sense of humor. There's only one snag. The Brothers of Light is a genuine organization. I read their advertisement in The Occult Gazette. What are you doing reading The Occult Gazette? I'm a witch. [LAUGHS] Hasn't helped me. Listen, have we still got that letter? It's in the file at my place. I'm gonna have a look at it. If it's promising, I'll have a talk with the Brothers of Light. They're in Manchester, Charles. Prove to me you're a witch. Enchant me. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] How's business? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOTS] [TIRES SCREECH] [GUNSHOT] That was a tight squeeze. May I speak to Reverend Braithwaite, please? I beg your pardon? Uh, Mr. Braithewaite. May I see him, please? Can anyone else help you? Oh, Sister. I have a problem. It's these desires, you see. I need to be close to people. Especially women. Especially women of faith. I want to... undress them. Oh, really? Tell me. Are you a real sister? No. Just a lay sister. [PHONE RINGING] BRAITHWAITE: Sister Jane, I'm expecting a Mr. Forbes. Has he come yet? Not yet, but I'm sure he will. Can I have your name, please? Kenneth Forbes. I have an appointment with Brother Braithwaite. Last door on the right at the end of the passage. Thank you for everything. You're welcome. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] BRAITHWAITE: Come... [CLEARS THROAT] Come in. [CLEARS THROAT] My flowers needed water. Most of the time, of course, they raise their heads to the light. Sometimes the effort is just too much for them, as it is often too much for us poor mortals. And we also need refreshment in order to keep our minds alert. Won't you sit down? All right, Mr. Forbes, what can I do to help you? It's-- it's... these desires, you see. Yes. Yes. Quite so. BIND: They won't give me peace. The images keep going round and round in my head, crackling and burning. It all goes back to when I was at boarding school. So when I saw your advertisement, I also saw hope, Mr. Braithwaite. For the first time in my life, I saw a hope. You just call me Brother Walter, would you? Of course, it is somewhat unusual for me to interview souls personally, but I can see that uh, in your case, the need is very great. Tell me, was it just our advertisement that drew you to us? BIND: No, no, no, not just that. I heard that some eminent men subscribe to your beliefs, and I must confess that that influenced my decision. That's very wise, Mr. Forbes, very wise. Yes, we do have some top people's souls. I understand that Mr. Loveday has attained the fifth stage of enlightenment. Why did such a wealthy man join you? Why did such a wealthy man join us? Well, the answer is very simple, Mr. Forbes. Brother Loveday was once very poor. But I well remember him, coming in here many years ago, a thin, pale lad, and asking me to help him. That was Brother Loveday? Yes, that's right. He'd been sleeping in the streets and hadn't eaten for two days. So we fed him, gave him a job fixing toys for our charity organizations, and found him somewhere to live. A room, it's down the road. Number thirteen, I think it was. Unlucky number. Unlucky for some, Mr. Forbes, but not for him. Do you know, I don't think I've ever seen such an expression of joy in a boy's eyes in my life before. So the rest is history, isn't it? He became a millionaire, and a very generous one at that. In fact, it's his donations that are keeping the doors open for other lost souls, such as you, Mr. Forbes. Now, to your problem, Mr. Forbes. Uh, yes. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, uh, I've got an appointment in twenty minutes. Perhaps I could drop back tomorrow and discuss salvation with you. Or Sister Jane. Please do, Mr. Forbes. Please do. But I think I should point out that Sister Jane is just a lay sister. One more soul saved. [DOORBELL RINGS] -Yes?-Are you the owner of the house? No. But whatever you're selling, we don't want it. Uh, I'm trying to locate a Mr. Loveday. He lived here a long time ago. You'd be too young to remember. Perhaps one of the older tenants might. Oh, well, uh... I think the only person who'd be likely to remember is a Mr. Simms. Uh, he's on first floor, number three. Oh, here he is. Uh, Mr. Simms, this gentlemen is inquiring about one of the older tenants. Uh, I thought perhaps you might help him. A Mr. Loveday. No, I uh, I never knew Arthur Loveday. BIND: So I'm uh, meditating and seeking enlightenment. You're not sure about the Brothers of Light? Sad thing is, I'm convinced they're genuine. And Mr. Simms? He doesn't know anything. Back to square one. Oh, by the way, Rockwell's had the bodies at Hayes Wharf checked out. He thinks they belong to an organization called K.R.A.S.H. You think they're Loveday's paid assassins? No. They'd be doing themselves out of business if they worked for Loveday. He's already killed two of their best clients. So, K.R.A.S.H. is for our benefit. Mm-hm. Oh! We 're off to a small hotelin Kensington. Sharing? Purely business, Charles. Why a small hotel in Kensington? Because that is where Loveday is. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening. You sure you won't have one? No, thank you, Charles. I think, um... I think I'll turn in now. Can I come up and read you a bedtime story? No, thank you, Charles. I know how that story ends. Why don't you tell it to Goldilocks? I might just do that. Mr. Bind. Ah, Mr. Loveday. Isn't it nice to see a friendly face? Not yours, Mr. Bind. I told you, you were not invited. I know. I wouldn't have come, but I had to ask you something. How does one attain the fifth stage of enlightenment? By minding one's own business, Mr. Bind. Something you'll never learn to do. And the Brothers of Light, is that your business, Mr. Loveday? Not a business. More a philanthropic foundation. They hold the truth for those who have the time to see it. In your case, Mr. Bind, I would say that would be rather less than 24 hours. Goodnight, Mr. Bind. Sleep well. Another Cognac, please. Small, medium, or family size? Oh, big one. -What's the lady drinking? -Gin and tonic. Large one. My name's Charles Bind. Do you make a habitof being the most beautiful girl in the room? I'm the only girl in the room, Mr. Bind. True. Oh. Oh, well. I figured you for a whip man, but... guns? Now that is different. Yes, well, I, uh... have this insecurity problem. Oh... get your clothes off. Well, I thought you were going to do that. All right. Anything you say. Hmm. Oh. Yes, well, uh, the insecurity soon passes. Why don't we lie down and talk about it? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] Poor Goldilocks. Aren't you glad that Mummy Bear was there? [LAUGHS] Thank you for your... assistance. That's all right. Next time be more careful choosing your playmates. Oh, dear. Good morning, Anna. I see you're still with us, Mr. Bind. Isn't life full of little surprises. [LAUGHS] Come on, girls. By the way, the next victim is going to be a surprise for you. Hah! Just like Christmas. SIMMS: No, I never knew Arthur Loveday. ANNA: Wake up, Charles. Charles! [SNAPS] Wake up! Anna, I think I've discovered something. -What? -Get dressed and go and see if there's a gun license in Simms's name. Mm-hm. Yes, boss. "Report: Joe Simms, born 1920, Manchester, son of James and Rose Simms. Public school and university. No war service, has ulcer"--hmm. "Doesn't work, lives from an anonymous trust fund set up in 1955. No gun license, no driving license, but has a pilot's license and owns a Piper Cub." He owns a light aircraft. Well, it's a long shot, but you'd better check out all the small airfields in and around London. You think he might be flying infrom Manchester? He'll be here all right. Loveday's only checked into this hotel for two days. One day's gone, so the next victim goes today. Ah. Can't you feel he's a madman? We've tapped his phone. Taped his conversations. The post office intercepts his mail. We've watched him and his girls day and night, and nothing. He tells us who he's gonna kill,where and when, and on the day he's watching like a vulture. You better call Rockwell. He'll cut down the red tape. Well, I can't call him from here, can I? BIND: Go and see him in his office. We need quick answers. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] The deadly Mr. Loveday is still in his room. Message for you, sir. Thank you. You looking for a taxi? The lady is. I'll take care of it. Taxi! Do be careful, Charles. You run along. I'll see you later. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] ANNA: What do you think you're doing? What? Oh, dear. [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, mate, you're some lady killer. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GUNSHOTS] What a performer. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You make a very good target sitting there. Yes. It's like the last shootout in a western. The two of us alone. Mine's bigger than yours, Loveday. [GUN CLICKS] Give up. LOVEDAY: Did you enjoy my surprise? Some surprise. Don't turn around quickly, Mr. Bind. Get the guns, Sunshine. Alan, do you think we should give our Mr. Bind a sporting chance? Eh, regrettably, Miss Hudson has uh, gone into the cold. I'm sorry about her demise, but I shall enjoy yours. This is Sunshine. He really enjoys killing. Hello, Sunshine. Alan, do you think Sunshine could kill Mr. Bind with his bare hands? He could take two of him for breakfast. Your day has come, Mr. Bind. Unfortunately, my money's on Sunshine. I've seen him killing men with his bare hands. Kill. [GRUNTING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] BIND: You ready to give up, Loveday? [GUNSHOT] That wasn't very sporting of you, Alan. Well done, Mr. Bind! Now you can play a little game with me. Sit down. [PANTING] You really should get a license for Sunshine. Now for our little game. What's all this about? LOVEDAY: You've caused me considerable trouble. It's very tiresome of you. Very tiresome. I don't know how you managed it, but there it is. You surely appreciate why I had to get Anna out of the way and why I must kill you. Oh, yes, of course. But tell me, how did you get Simms to kill for you? Money, Mr. Bind. Plus the fact that he's a man after my own heart. A man who hates the takers of the world. But he took money from you. I provided a five-hundred- thousand-pound trust fund, it's true. But he used the money to educate his children and make his mother comfortablein her old age. Ah. A dedicated and soft-hearted killer. What about the two girls? My fledglings? Women can be as deadly as men, don't you agree? In ten years' time, each of them will begin her blood mission. I'll have no further contact with my girls except to witness their killings. But how will you know when they will be doing their duty? Each will inform me of her liquidations through the personal columns of the Times. The message will look like an advertisement, but when it's decoded, I'll know who they're killing, and when. [LAUGHS] Murders planned ten years in advance? Yes. A kind of "pay now, kill later" plan. The choice of victims varies, but it'll keep a little surprise in an old man's life. I admire your scheme, and even your motives. But you are mad, Loveday. We shall see. Fate will show which of us is right. Now, this revolver has only one chamber loaded. I shall spin the cylinder and fire at you and then at myself in turn. [GUN COCKS] [GUN CLICKS EMPTY] [SIGHS] Ah! Now it's your turn. I'm afraid I can't wish you luck. [GUN CLICKS EMPTY] [GUN COCKS] Listen, this could get rather noisy. Why don't we just cut cards? I've got a pack in my room. No, I'm not worried about noise, Mr. Bind. I own this hotel. We are the only people here. [GUN CLICKS EMPTY] [SIGH] Fate doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind. Aren't you beginning to have your doubts, Loveday? [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] Told you we should've cut cards. Oh. [LAUGHS] You shouldn't have, Number one. I didn't, sir. They're for your nurse. The one with the big knockers. You'll notice, Number One, I don't waste public money. I insisted on a public ward. Well... I see you had all the patients moved out first. Yes, well, we have to maintain top security. You really ought to be more careful getting out of your bath, sir. -ROCKWELL: Ow! -Oh, I'm frightfully sorry, sir. ROCKWELL: Oh, oh, oh. There. Get on with your report, Number One. Yes, uh, well, we've uh, closed down K.R.A.S.H. We lost four operatives, but they are now well and truly defunct. Oh, good. And what about Loveday's girls? They've both been arrested, sir. There's somebody at the end of the ward who wants to talk to you. Thank you, sir. Nice to see you looking better. Oh. Ah! Get a nurse! Anna! Charles. I'm still ill. You need someone to look after you. ANNA: I suppose we could lie down and talk it over sometime. I didn't know you cared.
