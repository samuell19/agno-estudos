SANTARELLI PASTA STORE THE COMMISSIONER Who is it? Vice-commissioner Dante Lombardozzi. - My goodness! I appreciate that I may upset you, such a gentle creature. But you must see the man, not the public servant. Miss Marisa Santarelli, I have liked you since I first saw you. It was 40 days ago, as you were leaving your dad, Donato's pasta store. You know everything! Yes, You're 30. - 29. If you say so: You left school at 15. You don't practice any sports. Were you buying something? - No. Just looking. May I walk with you? Thank you. You're very kind. Now let me tell you everything about me. When I was nine. - Watch the step. This is how I met Marisa. I was then an unknown policeman. From that moment on, my career ambitions became a necessity. I waited eagerly for an opportunity, and it came to me when I least expected it. It was at dawn on April 20, when a group of kids from the poorer suburbs… You're late. We've been here since 5:00. We were freezing. - Who cares? Did you bring the cat? - Of course! This is the place where we launch the rocket. Is the cat going to die? Who cares? No, it won't die. The capsule is pressurized. Let go, I built the rocket! How many stages does it have? What stage? This is no theater performance. We're ready. - Don't burn my hand. Run! Run! Get down! Get down. - It's about to explode. Run! - We succeeded! What a flight! Down this way! - There it is! And the cat? - It must have ejected with a chute. No, here it is. It's dead! - As dead as you! There's a man on the road! Where? - Where are you going? It's true. - I'm scared! Who can it be? 1ST NATIONAL CONVENTION ON EUROPEAN COOPERATION These days of hardwork have seen the resurrection of our ideal, our civic, economic, social and Christian ideal. And it's name is "United Europe". Tomorrow is Easter Sunday. And our convention was organized in the name of brotherhood, with the aim of building and giving definite shape to what, thus far, has merely been a great, noble hope. Really? We have received just now some very saddening news. Our dear vice president, Professor Simeone Di Pietro, has suddenly passed away. This lamentable incident cruelly deprives us of an old friend and of the enlightened support of a great master in the ethical field. A most honest man. An exemplary husband and father. Put me through to the police station with Commendatore De Vita. Colonel, how old was your late brother? - 59. De Vita speaking. Yes. It's the chief. I need some news on the lamentable case of the late Professor Di Pietro. I am here with the medical examiner and was just reading his report, which confirms that he was run over by an unknown car. We are very sure. Moreover, the documents and money he carried, 140,000 lire, I believe, were left untouched. Forgive me for intruding, De Vita, but how will you go about this? We'll carry out the usual investigation to locate the car. I need to ask you something. But let it be clear that I do not wish to interfere. The late Simeone Di Pietro was in Rome for the convention on his own. He might have been fooling around. Did the deceased usually fool around? I see. You must understand that if these details, albeit secondary in nature and strictly related to his personal life, were to be released, the press would be all over it. The professor was such a prominent figure, of such lofty moral standards. The consequences could be out of proportions. Rest assured. We will be as discreet as possible during our investigation. As we try to locate the car that killed him, it would not make sense to dig into the victim's private life. You're welcome. Regards. Bye. The victim was quite the playboy. Didn't you know? I only met him once dead. Such secrets are not unveiled by doctors, but priests. Dr. Materazzo? - Yes? How far are we in the Di Pietro case? We're questioning the boys. - Keep me posted. Yes, Sir, soon as we've news. - Step back. Let's go on. Excuse me. - What is it? This is a list of the cars taken to panel-beaters for damages or dents in different areas, as of yesterday. Very well, thank you. Did you see any cars drive by? - No. Any suspicious parked cars? - No. Nothing? Go on. Have them sign the record and send them home. Yes, Sir. - Say goodbye. Hurry up, your moms must be worried. Hey, you, why have you grown a beard? I'm a blouson noir. I fight it all for a better world. And where's the bluson noir (black jacket)? - It was stolen. I searched the whole area around Focea street. After the crash, the car must have driven along a secondary road, blocked by a railway crossing that is always closed. A chair, guard. - Have you questioned anyone? Yes, the lineman. A certain… Mr. Trapane… Romeo Trapane, aged 57, who stated that at 3:45, a car traveling at high speed stopped at the crossing. Clearly the driver hadn't seen the barriers brake suddenly. The lineman went out to lift the barriers… What car was it? - A lightcolored Cinquecento. There's one of those in the panel-beaters list. Who is the owner? - Provetti, Armando. Your beard is so long, Armando. Do you only shave at Easter? I haven't been feeling well. I couldn't shave. You're lucky. If I don't shave every day, upwards and downwards, it goes wild. But who told you to become a soldier? - They called me up, pal. If you don't want to enroll, just pretend you're crazy. Crazy? - Crazy. Yes, act as a maniac, answer to no one and shake your head like this. And they fall for it? - Of course. The most modern psychiatrists have established that simulating insanity is a type of insanity. You really sound like a madman. - Did you not serve in the army? I did. I got an old-fashioned shrink. Come on, comb my hair. You're simulating cunning. - What have you heard? Anna, darling, don't squeeze too hard. - Provetti, Armando? Come back. - I didn't do anything! Stop him! - I was in bed! You were not home sleeping that night. How did you smash the light? - It's your car, you took it in. Listen… We know you stopped at the crossing. Why do you keep denying it? What is he saying? Speak clearly. - It was me. I couldn't sleep. I had cabbage roulade. What did you eat? Cabbage roulade. I went out and hopped in the car. I first thought of going to Brigato, but it was late. I ended up around Focea. Then I felt a crash. You can't go fast with a Cinquecento, it's no Ferrari! Didn't you see there was a man in the street? I swear on my father's head that I didn't. Your dad? But he's dead. I'll swear on whatever you want. Even on the graves of your dead. I only felt the crash. I thought it was a dog. Or just a builder. - A what? A boulder. But I stopped immediately, I promise. I saw he was dead. I panicked and ran away. Write everything down. Write, write. I knew I was going to get into trouble. It is always the poor people who pay the price. But no one touches the higher circles. It's not an issue. Sergeant Peluso. My goodness. Was he released? It was my Easter present. You did well. - No, I was released on bail. That's the way things go. Let's. hope not. Happy Easter. - Thank you. When will l have my license back? - After the trial, if all goes well. May I? Please come in. - Happy Easter from our department. This is to thank you for the bottles you sent. I thank you once more, dear Peluso. I extend, once more, my best wishes… - Thank you. …to you, your entire family and children. - Thank you. Can you have it carried to my car? Of course. - Thank you. Yes, Sir. The chief. My regards, Commendatore. Thank you. I will pass on your wishes to my staff. Very well. Some of the victim's friends would like a street in the new suburbs to be dedicated to him. Rest assured. The Di Pietro case has been closed. The file is being checked before it's forwarded to the prosecutor's office. Thank you. If you need anything, you can count on me. Thank you. Happy Easter. Goodbye. Commendatore, will you spend Easter at home? No, at my mother-in-law's, in Circeo. One needs to wind down during the holidays. Thankfully, it's a beautiful day. Beautiful indeed. But we risked spending Easter here, had we not solved the Di Pietro case. True. We were this close. Happy Easter. - Happy Easter. 2nd DEPARTMENT VICE-COMMISSIONER D. LOMBARDOZZI It has not been solved. I beg your pardon? I said the Di Pietro case has not been solved. Sergeant Polidori, come here. Stop eating! - Here I am. Something is not right. What are you saying? - I don't say anything, it's them. Sit here. Read this. And quit eating Easter sweets! Go on, read. "The statement of the railway crossing linesman." "When asked he replied, 'I was asleep. It must have been 3:45 am, '" "'when, after hearing a car brake violently, I went outside'" "'and I saw that a light colored Cinquecento," '"had been traveling at high speed and stopped inches away from the barriers.'" "'I lifted the boom gate and the car drove off.'" "When asked, he answered," "'I noticed no dents in the car's body, '" "'because…'" - Why? - Why? Because… Read on, you idiot. "'Because I was blinded by the two headlights.'" Now read this statement. "Statement of Perella Santini, panel beater." "When asked, he answered, 'I repaired a lightcolored Cinquecento, '" "'belonging to Armando Provetti of the following, '" "'broken glass and light bulb of the right headlight.'" Did you see the contradiction? - No. - You didn't? Polidori, why are you still a sergeant at 60? Because I'm too nice. - Because you're slack. You read without understanding. Read my note, here. "The panel-beater says one of the lights was broken." "The lineman says both headlights were on." What shall we do? What shall we do? It's a mistake. We erase it with correction fluid. It's Easter. Very well. Polidori, go to the typewriter. Yes, Sir. - Write down my words. Dear Investigating Magistrate, I found a discrepancy in the witnesses' evidence but I believe it is a mistake which I will erase with correction fluid, as it is Easter. Signed, Sergeant Polidori. What do I have to do with this? - What do you have to do with it? You can't delete mistakes! Those who made it must fix it! They are all gone. He who did it has left. It's Easter. It's Easter! Do you think the police stops working at Easter? We're here! - We are only in charge of this office. Maybe you, who are overage, have no ambitions and are alone in the world. I'm different. I'm ambitious and want to move up the ladder! I will take any opportunity to stand out, as I'm young, eager and just got engaged. What are you doing? - Doing? Taking action! Has the lineman died? - Who is it? Don't you know it's Easter, son? - Forgive me. Are you the lineman Romeo Trapane? - Yes, what do you want? Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi, from the police headquarters. Happy Easter. I gotta run though, I'm cooking lunch. Where are you going? Trapane! Trapane, you told the investigating authorities… Is it lamb? - Cat. Cat? - Would you care for some? I don't think so, you filthy thing! If you haven't tried it, you can't appreciate it. It's a tasty meal, and it goes well with wine. I see you like wine? I do. Especially the cannellini. - Is that so? You signed a statement, saying that on the night of the 20th, a Cinquecento stopped at the crossing with both headlights turned on. Is that correct? - Yes. Both lights were on? - Yes. Yes? Then how do you explain this? One of the car's headlights was broken. How could you have seen both of them on? How would I know? - Were you drunk? No. I wasn't there! You weren't there? What are you saying? Don't do this to me! - Get off me! Forgive me. - I just had a shot! I had to leave the crossing that night. I was desperate. Ah! You gave false testimony. That night, I went out looking for my wife. Your wife? Don't you live together? - No, that lousy woman! I was told anonymously I had to catch her in the act. He left his duty for trifling reasons. - What are you doing? I'm reporting you. You seem insane. It is very dangerous. You can't have this responsibility. - Wait! That damned night, my brother took my place. He told me everything. It's no false testimony! Trapane, you're a disgrace. If you say so. - Let's not make this worse. Where does your brother work? - At the Gasparino Pisacane worksite. May you be hit by lightning! - Stay calm. Calm down. I know everything. I'm not stupid. Come here and answer the questions. That's all you need to do. Here, hold my suitcase. Are you his brother? - Yes. Riccardo Trapane? - Yes. Riccardo Trapane, I'm told that on the night of the 20th, you were on duty at railway crossing number 121. Correct? Yes. You cuckold! You heard that? - Yes, I couldn't care less. Riccardo Trapane, you saw a car stop at the crossing? - Yes. Were both headlights of the car turned on? Yes! - You keep quiet. Both of them? - Yes. Shut up! I'll put you in jail. Are you sure? - Positive! You see, there is no need to report me. The panel-beater says the light was broken. What do I care? - You left your job and you don't care! Trapane, what's going on? Who is it? - Please. Nothing boss, chatting with friends. - What friends? Who are you? - The surveyor. And you? Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. - Good morning. Your security guard Trapane left the site on the night of the 20th. I see. - You ruined me. My suitcase! You two! You can't fight yet, I have to question you! Take this. What is it? - Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. I'm praying. - I must question you. I've been questioned four times. What do you want? I need to inspect the repair shop. It's about the light bulb. Now? - Yes, now. I'm with my family. We're going to Marino. Can't it wait until Tuesday? - No, it can't. A church is no place for small talk. Mind your own business, old lady. I'm with the police. Come with me, Perella. Aldo, where are you going? I need to go to the shop with the commissioner. Pick me up there. I wasn't finished praying. Shall we? - Move. Mom, who are they? - Don't know. So the light bulb was broken? No, it doesn't say it was broken, only that I changed it. It's 40 km to Marino! - Let's go! He's spoiling our day! What does he want? Why did you change it, if it wasn't broken? Because the filament was broken. Be good kids for your daddy! Dad, we are hungry! Let's go! If the filament was broken, why were both lights on before the car crossed the boom-barriers? The filament must have still been attached before the crossing. It must have come off later. It happens. Dad, let's go! Let's go, Dad! The crash broke the glass, but not the light bulb? Exactly. When are we going? Any other damage to the front of the car? - No. Easy, kids. Dad's coming! - Is the car here? Yes. I want to take a look. This way, please. We're hungry! You see the light? Dad! - Be good, kids! Just a moment! Oh, my God, you hit your head! Are you hurt? - Damned, rotten, stinking…! Put it under cold water. Marisa! Dante! Hello. - Hi, dear. This is my friend Clara. My fiancé, Dr. Lombardozzi. Dante Lombardozzi. Nice to meet you. How are you? - Well, thank you. And you? Excuse me, I need to talk privately with my fiancée. I was supposed to have lunch at your parents' at 1:00, but I can't. But it's Easter Sunday! - It's best to make a sacrifice because a small discrepancy is turning into an interesting case. I hope to impress the senior officers. I'm so glad, dear. But I can tell you want to know more. Tell me the truth. It doesn't matter. - Sorry, I can't tell you. When can you come? - Let's synchronize our watches. 12:06, and you? - 12:06. Great, our watches get along, too. I'll be at your parents' at 1:37. - Good. So I can finally meet Mom and Dad. Shall I bring flowers? Don't worry about it. - As you say. Kiss? I had a shot, it hurts. Poor baby! - Another kiss. Bye. - Bye. Dante! Dr. Dante Lombardozzi. How are you? - Good, thank you. Bye. Do you think Mom and Dad will like him? You know what? Why does he wear his hair like that? It doesn't look too bad. Doesn't he look like a vulture? - No. DOG RAGING TRACK Provetti, I need information. - Benedict in the 4th, Piselino in the 5th. I'm not here to bet on dogs. Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. What's with you? You run over people and then go and have fun? So what? It was an accident. You told the investigators, you didn't see the victim. That you only felt the crash on the front of the car. And you believed you had hit a dog or a builder. You mean a boulder? - You said builder. I need to go bet before they close. How can you not have seen Di Pietro? He's 6' tall. Are you shortsighted? - No. But you didn't see him? He must've been relieving himself on the street! A professor, relieving himself on the street? They're off and I haven't bet on Benedict. Go, go, go! There you go, Benedict won because I was listening to you. I lost 25,000 lire because of you. You would've won 25,000 lire? - 25,000. I have to work a whole week to make that money. But hadn't the case been closed? Excuse me, I'm busy. Busy, eh? Benedict? 2,000 on Apache. 1,000 lire on Piselino! - Of course. There he goes! Piselino? - He didn't leave the gate. Final results for the 5th race, first place, Eccentrico, second place, Pausa. Grandma, when are we eating? I'm starving. It's time we ate. I'm hungry. Kids, don't play with the ball inside. What time is he coming? At 1:37. - It's 1:37 now. There he is. Maria, let him in. That's the phone. - I'll get it. Hello, Dante? What do you mean? Mom has cooked the pasta timbale for you. You can't? You really can't? Is he coming? - Too bad. Bye. What did he say? He apologizes, but he can't make it. He's in charge of a very important and mysterious case. Who cares? He should have called earlier. Maria, serve the pasta! The appetizers first! But couldn't he postpone this mysterious thing until tomorrow? Mom. - Let's drink. He's spoiled her Easter. - Of course. I was right never to like policemen. My daughter, come back. And you, Dad! - Be careful. What is her fiancé like? - She says he's handsome. I've never seen a handsome policeman. Three spaghetti with butter, three fettuccine, two orecchiette. Put them down. You want spaghetti too? - With butter. Did you invite Lombardozzi? - Are you crazy? Fat chance. - Good day. Happy Easter! Happy Easter, Doctor. Happy Easter, Pitti. Hello, Bettamini. Thank you. - Are you working? I have to, unfortunately. I don't have your standing, nor a beautiful family like yours. I must work. Five minutes just to clear up something, and I'll leave. Don't you have a girlfriend? - Yes, poor thing. I had to sacrifice Easter lunch with her and the in-laws, whom I haven't met. In your report… - Can Giancarlo have fried food? No, it's too heavy. He has liver problems. The kid? So young? - Yes. If I may, it says Di Pietro died… - Di Pietro? The one who was run over? - Yes. Fried brains and artichokes. It says here that he died of a blow that destroyed his left parietal bone, injuring his brain. Brain and artichokes. - No, just artichokes. This is not the place to discuss that! - You mean the brain? Forgive me, Ma'am, but I'm on duty. Yes, but we're eating. This is no morgue. Shall we go somewhere else? - Let's go. You must excuse me. The life of a policeman is beautiful but hard. After I tell you what I suspect, you will agree with me. You're the one making it hard. Mom, what is Dad doing? - Who knows? Ubalto, it's Easter Sunday! I'm pretending to be a car. What's going on? Your Excellency! Just a moment. Thank you. But haven't you… Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. Please, Your Excellency. Colonel! Troops, at attention! Troops, at ease! Where is he? Who is he? Colonel? Colonel Menotti Di Pietro. I'm the victim's brother. Who are you? How dare you? What is this nonsense? Vice-commissioner Dante Lombardozzi. The case was reopened due to new doubts and suspicions. Doubts? Suspicions? What doubts are you talking about? The case was closed! - And now reopened. Don't insist. I demand explanations, clarifications. Your ways are so uncivilized! I fought in two wars. You can't insult someone who sacrificed everything for his duty. I'm doing my duty, too, and I'm running a temperature, too. Don't let him through! - Get you hands off me! There are dozens of people out there, authorities, and even the armed guard! I'll call in the guard to vacate the building! - You're mad! I'll handle it myself. What's going on? - There'll be a new autopsy. How come? Excuse me. Make him spin! What are you making me do? I'll get dizzy! Here's the stick! Don't look! Commendatore! The phone! It's Rome! From Rome? - It’s Grandpa's turn. Yeah, Grandpa! Come here, Grandpa! Tie it well. Good. Spin him! Where are you, going? Where are you going? Grandpa over here! Let him be! Are you leaving? - There's trouble. I must go to Rome. You'll be back? - I'll call you. Your handkerchief. - OK. Bye. Dad, are you leaving? - Yes, tell Grandpa to move out of the way. What happened? The commendatore's here! Get back! What is this mess? - Let him through! Get out of the way! A statement? Materazzo and Ippolito? - In their office. Do you know anything? - We know everything! What happened? Who dared change my orders? He did! - Him! Him? - Me! Who are you? Vice-Commissioner Lombardozzi, Dante. From the second department. Oh, yes. Well, what happened? Due to the urgent nature of the file, I started working straight away. I noticed a difference between the two statements. As yesterday all the offices of the department were empty… It was a holiday. Go on. Dr. Longo's report is explanatory and comforting. The superficial scratches caused by the dragging on the ground don't justify. Doesn't justify what? When he was hit by the car, Professor Di Pietro was already dead. Dead? - Four hours approximately. What are you doing? Don't! What is it? - My hat. Was it a seizure? A heart attack? - No. A blow to the head. With an unknown object, by an unknown hand. Premeditated? You sound like a criminology manual! - Thank you. It's that idiot's confession, Provetti, who misled us. One must always dig deeper. I thought it weird that Provetti hadn't seen a 6 foot man. Yes. - He ran over a corpse. He must therefore be cleared. - Yes. Did I do well, Sir? - Very well. Luckily, the prosecution hasn't received the file yet. Very lucky. - Did I do well, Sir? You did well! How many times do I have to say it? What do you want? A promotion? You're too kind, Commendatore. Boy! With the Di Pietro case, we're back to square one! Square one. - Get to work! Out of the way! - OK. I'll break the news to those annoying journalists. I'll go with you. Will you mention my name? I'm available for the new investigation, hoping you won't leave me out. Listen, you have worked too much on this case already. Leave it alone and go back to your office. My office is in the basement, but that's not the point. We, Lombardozzis, have a long tradition. My dad was a police sergeant. He made many sacrifices so I could study. Well done, Daddy. - But not so I could be a pencil pusher! Lombardozzi, there are no pencil pushers here. We only have offices, staffed by officers who are all equally needed and equally useful. Do you have any ideas? - Yes, Sir. Let's hear it. - The late Di Pietro was staying at the Convention Hotel and was found 30 km away. Why? Excuse me, I don't get it. Speak up, son! Cherchez la femme. - God, you speak French. It's not about French. In the victim's pocket, a receipt a champagne bottle was found. Moët et Chandon. - So? An orgy? Listen, Lombardozzi. Go to your office and don't meddle with this case. Got it? Your time will come. Hello, my friends. Stay seated. Since the start, we suspected there was something else. The solution to the case appeared to be too easy and never convinced us. We therefore deemed necessary to carry out an additional… He was really kind, Marisa. He congratulated me. He kissed me on the cheek. He never does that with anybody, he's such a grouch. But he doesn't see all my qualities, or he wouldn't have said, "Go back to your office, now." What is it, Marisa? You're grumbling, Dear. Aren't you following me? Am I boring you? I know your job is important, but you haven't met my parents yet. They have invited you three times, and you never came. Where are we going now? What must you do now? Dear, it was I who said, "I want to be engaged," "I want to meet your mom and dad." If I haven't, it's because my job doesn't let up. You're too hectic. Why work so hard if your director doesn't ask you to? Firstly he's my boss, not the director. And I work so hard because I care about my career and our future. You mustn't forget that your fiancé is a policeman. When we have a lead, nothing can stop us. There are no holidays and no rest. Like a doctor. If your fiancé was a doctor, where would he take you? To see a patient. Since you're a police commissioner, are you taking me to a murderer? I wish. Have you found the person who killed that poor guy? If we had, my darling, do you know where I would be now? At your place, eating a lovely plate of pasta. Pasta Santarelli fills you up and makes you beautiful. As beautiful as Mr. Donato's daughter. You're beautiful, Marisa. Who's better-looking? Marisa or Dante? There you go. You distracted me, and I didn't see the stop sign. Good day, didn't you see the sign? - Honestly, no. Your license. - Right away. I'm Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. - I don't know you. Now do you know me? I'm sorry. Next time, try to be more careful. For your own sake. Are you letting me go? Are you not going to fine me? You may be on duty, you might have been in a hurry. Did I say I was on call? - But, Dante… Let me handle this, Marisa. I don't like personal favors. If I was any citizen, would you book me? I don’t know. I doubt it. You should! If there was an offense, you must inflict a fine! If you say so. Not because I say so but because it's your duty! Have you got 1000 lire? CONVENTION HOTEL Good morning. Have you worked here for long? - Since the hotel opened. You're with the police, aren't you? I'm Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. How did you know? Well, from a lot of things. You're clever, eh? You see and understand everything? My job has taught me a bit of psychology. What is your name? - Ettore Gargiulo. Are you on duty every day? - Every day and night. Did you know Professor Di Pietro? Once I see them once, I remember all of the guests. Then you'll remember that Di Pietro left the hotel one last time on the 20th. Yes, the poor Di Pietro. - Gargiulo! - Excuse me. Yes, Sir? Right away. Thank you. Was he alone that evening? Do you remember any interesting details? I remember everything perfectly. - Very good. Tell me. I… - What? Speak up. They won't issue my passport, because of a petty fine. Can you help me? - You help justice and I'll see. That night, the professor left after 8:00. He didn't greet me as usual. "Weird," I thought. - Yes. He walked briskly towards that corner. He was a sportsman. He would run 10 km every day. A bit crazy? - He was an Alpine soldier. At the corner, he met with a very conspicuous person. A cardinal? - No, a woman. One of "those"? The good old professor! Very good, Gargiulo, you're a good citizen. Do you remember the woman? Can you describe her in detail? Yes, of course. She was waiting next to the car, at the corner. She had red hair. - Red hair? I remember her well, although she was trying to go unnoticed. I mean that she went into the car. She was… …voluptuous. She looked like many others. Like that one there. You see, she smiled. That one there, for instance, is willing. Is she? You know everything. - Well, not to brag… So, about my passport? - Why are you asking me? There's a special department for passports! What it is? Never ask questions when I'm on call. Rather answer me this, couldn't you dress more decently? - What? In a less conspicuous way. - What are you saying? You're engaged to a policeman. - Dante! Gargiulo. - Yes, Colonel? What did he want? Sorry, I was hungry. Here they are. Dad, where are your manners? Are you starving? Where is he? He's not coming. When a policeman has a lead, he never rests. I knew it. Your daddy has always advised you right. Please, tell him to get lost. I did. - Well done! Good morning. Moët et Chandon. Are you after an Easter egg? - No. Champagne. Would you like a bottle? - I don't drink. I need to know if this receipt is yours. Yes, why? The person who drank that bottle died. Died? - Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi. I only sell them. I'm licensed to sell alcohol. These bottles are manufactured abroad. I don't care. I need to know who you sold the bottle to. Let me think. - Think hard. We don't sell much champagne. I remember. - A tall, old man with one of those women? No, a boy. Ferruccio, the night concierge at the Aria e Sole motel not far from here. That's why I gave him an invoice. For a higher amount? - He asked for it. What's his name? - Ferruccio. And six. - Ferruccio, you're too lucky. Another game? - Get lost! Guys, Ferruccio is free. Who wants to play? No one? You're scared. Hello, Ferruccio. - I don't know you. Don't you work nights at the Aria e Sole? - So what? You might not remember but I know you well. Do you want to have a game? What do you have in mind? Another theft? Theft? Who does that? A bottle of champagne worth 3,600 lire, charged at 5,000. Here. You tell me if I am lying. Do you recognize this? Now I recall. You're the guy who came in without being seen. I thought you were a gentleman. Watch your mouth, scoundrel. - Hands off. Asylum told me. She said she had a VlP in the car, who couldn't be seen. The redhead? - Yeah. You call her Asylum? - She's crazy. Maria AKA Asylum. Hello, officer. - A cappuccino. Give me a coke. - Are all the pool tables taken? Where can I find Asylum? - Why? Did you lose her? Can you help me find her? Of course. Really? - How much will you pay? Is it enough? - Gimme that. Good morning, Commissioner. I knew you weren't a gentleman. - You recognized me. You didn't recognize me when you needed to. Come here. They are all underage! - It's not my duty. Where are you going? - Out, guys! Just because he said… - You're underage. Are you serious? - Of course. I told you, she did everything. Maria Asylum. She chose lodge number 12. I remember. - 12. 12? - Yes, I remember exactly. She sent me to get the champagne. He was already inside when I got back. She opened the door only slightly. Ferruccio, don't you write down the names of the motel's guests? Of course, we do. You didn't check in Professor Di Pietro. I told you, some clients don't want to be recognized. To keep quiet, you charge double for everything, room, champagne… No. The Aria e Sole's guests are all happy with the service. They always come back. Don't count on Professor Di Pietro coming back. Are we there? - Yes. Which one is Maria Asylum? - She's not here yet. But she will be. Come on, have a cigarette. No. I don't smoke. - It will help you relax. We've been here an hour. She is not coming. They must have invited her for lunch. Speaking of which, since she is not coming, I might as well eat. Wait here, I need to make a call. - OK. Hello? It's him. I'm not talking to him. - No? How rude. - You talk to him! What shall I say? - Whatever you want. She doesn't want to talk to you. I'm the mother. We haven't met. Nice to meet you. What a beautiful voice. It's so youthful I can't believe you're the mother. A matter of fact, on the phone, you sound like Marisa when she was younger. We're a simple family. But we all love each other. I never had a complete family, with a grandfather. Now I have lost Mom and Dad. I'm alone. Poor thing! Cheer up and come to us quickly. A mother heals all pains. - What are you saying? Hello, Dante. My dear Marisa, forgive me if I'm a bit harsh at times. I have my principles, but I do love you. You mustn't be sad. Am I forgiven? Yes, of course. Where are you? On the right path. I think I did well today. We haven't found the killer yet. I've been lying in ambush for an hour, to no avail. But while I was waiting, I couldn't help thinking of you. When will I see you? - Now, if you wish. I'm done for today. I'm afraid I must give up. Can I come over? Yes. Are they all there? OK, Marisa, I'll be right there. In due course. Kiss? No, Dante. Come on, why not? Marisa Santarelli is my fiancée. I'm having lunch at her place. If the redhead arrives, call me and I'll come back straight away. You got it? I'm counting on you! - Don't worry. Doctor! - What? - There she is! Oh, my. Right when I told Marisa I was going to her place. Call that number and tell my fiancée that I was going to her place, but suddenly my prey came to me. She must understand and forgive me. OK. - She'll get mad again. Can't help it. Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? Somewhere a friend recommended. Where is it? It's too far. It's out of town, but it's great. I'm told you can do anything, and nobody will ever know. What? The Aria e Sole motel? Yes. Do you know it? - I've never been there. I can't tell you who I am, I am a public figure. I must be very discreet in my love life. You must have met lots of men who don't want to be identified. Stop rambling. Stop, I want to get out! I don't want to be with you! - Take it easy. Is it your first time? Here we are. All the lodges are self-contained, right? Yes, you may come and go as you please. That's why you must pay upfront. Do you like it? - Yes. Why are we here? Why did you choose number 12? It's my number. For my hotel room, I choose number 12, if I gamble, I play number 12. It gives me luck. Don't you like 12? - I don't care. Is it OK for you? - It's fine. Everything is fine? - Yes. Leave us. It's nice, isn't it? How come you hadn't been here before? - I never had. This room must have seen the craziest things. Already? - What are you looking for? Would you like a strong drink? Or perhaps a bottle of French champagne? Moët et Chandon. They don't have it here. How do you know? You told me you've never been here before. Why, you're shaking. What do you want from me? Who sent you? A friend. Professor Di Pietro. Do you know him? - No! No? - I know nobody. You're sweating. - No… - Yes, you are. He said, "Go with the redhead, Asylum. I had a great time." Are you shaking? Scared? - No. I want to try it, too. If it's true, I want to try it, too. What? My body scares you? - You have a gun. Yes. - Are you a cop? I'm a cop, so what? Cops make love too. Unless you have reason to fear me? - No. Who was the mysterious man? - No. Professor Di Pietro? - No! You came to this room together? - No! You lay in this bed? - No! Then what? You drank champagne? A bottle of French champagne? - No. Did you have an orgy? What did you do with the bottle? You smashed it on his head? - No! Who was here with you? Did you have an accomplice? Who was it? Tell me! Answer me! What happened? Maria! What's wrong? I'm questioning you. I'm a police officer on duty. You're as pale as a corpse. Are you ill? Are you hysterical? You were already ill, weren't you? Answer. I'm going to slap you. He's in number 12. I'll put you in the shower. - Dante! Marisa? She fainted. I was questioning her. - Swine! It was necessary, dear. - She insisted on coming. Shut up! Marisa! Marisa! Wait! You scoundrel! - My God! So these are your principles? - I'm bleeding. Coward! - Why are you doing this? What are you saying? - Don't touch me! Right, run after her now! Go away! That's why you never came home! Oh, my, I'm bleeding. Oh, God! What a blow. What a terrible blow. From my Marisa. Open up! I know you're in there! Who is it? What do you want? Provetti? What are you doing here? - I live here. You live here? This is where she's hiding. Ah, you're the maquereau! What's a maquereau? - Do you know what a pimp is? You can't, this is my home! Do you have a warrant? Open up! - There's nobody there. Open! - Who are you after? Tell her to open or I'll charge you too! Where's the other door? - I don't know. You don't? Yes, you do! There she is! You let her get away. And them? Who called them? Great, the police are here. We'll catch her. And you'll both go to jail! It was me! I confess! - What? I did it! I can't take it any longer! I did it! I killed him! Let me be! I confess! I'll tell everything! I did it! I killed him! What's happening? What's with him? - He confessed. He confessed? - Confessed. I said I confess! What do you want from me? I can't take it anymore! What's wrong with him? - Epilepsy. He was caught and had a seizure. Hold him. Put him on the bed and put a handkerchief in his mouth. Or he'll bite his tongue. How did you find out? How did you find out? The headlight was the key to the mystery. Provetti's car headlight was too low to hit a man standing, but too high to hit a man lying on the ground. As a matter of fact, Provetti also confessed to the investigating magistrate. Is it clear? Did you understand? Commendatore, will you issue a press release? Yes, we will. In the meantime, I can describe the incident, as Provetti confessed it. I have the statement with me. That night, Professor Di Pietro stopped Provetti's car on the Aurelia road and asked for a ride. The professor was an Alpine trooper. He liked to go for long walks. He was very health-conscious. According to Provetti's confession, they started to talk about politics. Provetti, as you know, is a bad person. A raté, to use the French word. He criticized some leaders in a rather crude way. The professor didn't refrain and replied along the same lines. I'm relating the key points of Provetti's confession. They exchanged fiery words. According to Provetti, the professor then struck him. They struggled. He then hit him with the tire chains he carried in his car. Realizing that the professor had died, Provetti simulated the car accident. Then, as he was seen at the railway crossing by the lineman, he stopped the car and smashed the headlight with a kick. And it was the smashed light that give the idiot away. Excuse me, Commendatore, how was the confession obtained? Was it easy to get a confession from Provetti? Well, relatively easy. Our officers were closing in on him, he had no escape. I take the opportunity to congratulate my staff. Dr. Materazzo, Dr. Ippoliti, and… Dr. Lombardini. Commissioner. - That's all you need to know. Who's, Lombardini? - Now, you may leave, my friends, because we all have a lot to do. Goodbye. Congratulations. - My dear, you had a baby. - Thank you. My regards to the editor. Good night. - Good night. Goodbye. Commendatore, may I? Yes, go into my office, darling. Materazzi, I'll see you later. Please, Commendatore. You acted unprompted again. - Commendatore. But this time, I must admit you did the right thing. Thank you for mentioning my name, albeit incorrectly and for your kind words, which I may not deserve. - It was my duty. And my duty is to tell you about a detail I noticed which is quiet interesting. There it goes! - What is it? Don't worry. I was hit hard on the nose and am now bleeding. Talking about the state in which ProVetti was… Yes? - I hope the seizure story is true. Of course. - I hope so. Or you'd be in trouble. Are you joking? - Not at all. I didn't touch Provetti. - Let's not speak about it then. Do you remember when you came back to Rome, angry that I had spoiled your Easter? So you did. - Do you recall what I said? You said many things. But you must remember this one, a hypothesis that really impressed you. Cherchez la femme. So what? I found her. - Who? - La femme. She's a very provocative, red-haired woman, who met in private with the professor that night, at the Aria e Sole motel. But what is most surprising, Commendatore, is that by stubbornly following the woman, I got there. - Where? You say it. - You say it. - No, you. - You! At Provetti's. That's your discovery? Give me time to explain the connection. How can we rule out that the girl told Provetti, her alleged pimp, that the professor had a lot of cash on him? We would then have manslaughter, but with an intended robbery. No. It can't be. Why not? - The cash was found on the body. Lombardozzi, move away. Stay there. What are you going on about? Manslaughter? The cash on the body? Provetti a pimp? - You can't deny the facts are interesting. What interesting facts? We have a very clear confession. Let me read it for you. It says… Out of the way. Provetti says, "No, I had no accomplices or helpers." Lombardini, keep away from me. Listen to me. I want to be honest. Sit. We must be extremely careful in this investigation. We must handle it with kid gloves. The fact that Professor Di Pietro, illustrious sociologist, great educator, chairman in 50 congresses, wanted to have some fun, is understandable. Don't judge the book by its cover! - We're all men. But we mustn't unnecessarily tarnish the memory of a man who played such a prominent role in the history of our country. What's that look? Don't get me wrong. I said unnecessarily, as the case is closed. Otherwise, I would dig deeper. I'm a tough man. I'd arrest my mom. And I wouldn't? - You would, I know. Materazzo? - Yes? - Come here. What is the name of the woman that allegedly was with Di Pietro? - Maria Asylum. After Provetti's confession, I lost her, but I can find her again. No. Your head is like a volcano, it never rests. - I'm restless. It's who I am. Lombardozzi? - Yes? I must confess something. I had underestimated you. - Certainly. Three years in the basement. We all have to go through an apprenticeship. Too long. - I got it. - Frankly. You were successful. You deserve a reward. You want, to climb two steps? - Yes. I'll put you up two floors. Oh, my! I'll have you move here, into Costantino Del Franco's office. - I can't believe it! It's not true. - What are you saying? I am so happy that I don't know how to thank you. I'm overwhelmed. Leave! - Yes. Thank you very much, Commendatore. Materazzo, I was transferred! What happened? - I transferred him. To Sardinia? - No, to Del Franco's office. Materazzo, you need to find a girl, a prostitute. Maria Asylum, that's all I know. Polidori, packup! We're moving upstairs. A promotion? - Yes! As of today, you can call me Commissioner Lambardozzi. Dear Commendatore De Vita, l thank you for the promotion you kindly awarded me with. I am also pleased to report on my first mission in my new role. I am glad, Commendatore, as I do not argue and follow orders. I inspected the center for disadvantaged kids and can assure you that Baragli, Nino and Colangioli, Otello have behaved well and are repenting. All in caps? - I'm not used to this typewriter. It's not the typewriter. It's your head. I put up with you only because my father liked you, for no reason. I'm not too mean, considering your behavior, am I? You're stressed. - I am. But you know why? Sadly, Marisa doesn't want to see me anymore. My satisfaction for the promotion is dampened by her attitude. Let's hope she understands, unlike you, and that everything goes back to normal. Why am I talking to you? Type. I have some ideas for these juveniles that I would like to present to you, who have reached the summit of a career… Come in. Who is it? Well? Who ordered that? We did. - You did? Why? Don't you want to celebrate? Congratulations and good luck. Thank you. - Your treat. - My pleasure, my friends. Your consideration touches me deeply. Polidori, toast with us. Your friendship, your support, what can I say? I'm thrilled. Our department is like a family. And on our door hangs a blue ribbon. Why? Hasn't the stork brought Commissioner Lombardozzi? Cheers. - Cheers, my friends. A toast to the Di Pietro case, brilliantly closed, and to our careers. Have you heard that the girl, Asylum, has died? Ippoliti and Materazzo, De Vita needs you. - Coming. - Goodbye. Sorry and congratulations again! - Hey, Materazzo? Asylum died? She killed herself with gas. Her brother found her this morning. Where were we? Sad. And unlucky. What are you typing, Polidori? "You who have reached the summit of a career, sad and unlucky." Referring to De Vita? - Yes. Isn't it too short? Polidori. Who are you? A Martian? No head, just a big nose. Vice-commissioner Lombardozzi? - Commissioner, he was promoted. Peluso! - Here he is. - Who are you? I am Secca, Provetti's lawyer. - What do you want? My client asks to see you urgently. I'm no longer on the case. - It's extremely important. The case is closed, as far as I am concerned. Provetti wants to see you personally. It's already been approved. Thank you for coming. I'm innocent. My confession was false. Really? Who killed Di Pietro? Maria. She killed him. - Of course. She can't deny it now. I only confessed to save Maria. You know how it happened. You were about to catch her. Provetti, are you saying you did it for love? Do you even know what that is? With your face? Yes, I loved her. You can't understand. Your job has dried your heart. Right, my job has dried out my heart. I can't understand these things. But you loved her and made her sell herself. Right? What does that have to do with it? It's work. You were right not to tell me anything. I wouldn't have come. Please, Commissioner. You, go on. OK. I was her pimp, too. But if we don't protect these poor girls, who will? And she wasn't right. She was mad, otherwise she wouldn't have stolen the money from the professor. The money was not stolen. The professor woke up. He started to scream. He hit her. She panicked and hit him on the head with the bottle. A champagne bottle that Di Pietro had ordered. I was in bed. She called me in the middle of the night. I got in the car. There's a motel, with low-rise lodges. I know the one. You know I've been there. You have some nerve. Provetti, why are you lying? I'm not lying. It's the truth. Don't you believe me? We cleaned up the room. We loaded the body in the car. What a night! Maria fainted twice. We drove for God knows how long. We wanted to drop him on the street, but there was too much traffic. Then Focea was deserted. And I am to believe you? Of course. Why would I confess? If it was just the headlight, I wouldn't have admitted to anything. I would've been tried on circumstantial evidence. I confessed to protect Maria. You know it! You put me in here! You framed me! Provetti, I'm here only as a courtesy to your lawyer. If you act like this, I'll leave. You may not believe me, but I confirm his statement. I saw the girl a few days ago and convinced her to come forward within 24 hours. You can't imagine her state. I felt sorry for her. She must have killed herself out of fear of going to jail. What if the girl had not died? What were you hoping for? - She could've gone abroad. She has an uncle in Venezuela. She could have sent a confession from there. I am sure she did write one! She wouldn't abandon me like this! If she had, they would've found it. The first to walk in her room was her brother, Giovanni. Did she have a brother? He has a fruit and vegetable stall at the markets. That wrecked brother of hers! He wants to ruin me! He said I ruined his sister's life! He threatened to kill me! That's why I covered for her! So it wasn't for love? That too. It was? Listen, Provetti. You can't lie to me. You want to come across as an angel. But let me read what you really are. At 14, you stole a tricycle from a baker's boy. At 15, you vandalized the seats in a cinema with a razor blade. At 16, you sold your home's mattresses, bought a gun with the proceeds and attempted to rob a petrol station. At 18, you were sentenced for pick-pocketing. At 19, you abused a 16 year old girl and beat her 97 year old grandmother. What does this have to do with anything? At 21, you were sentenced by the Court Martial for simulating insanity. You've also been found guilty of car theft, failure to assist your ill dad, brawling and bodily harm at the Sweet and Lovely dance club, you have a son you refuse to recognize. You have exploited at least three prostitutes. You stole the hard-earned savings of a janitor at Val d'Aosta and attempted to drown her by pushing her off the dock. I can go on. I've a very long report. - No. We know all this. The law must not worry about the past, but care for the future. Machiavelli said it. Councilor, we all studied Machiavelli at university. Why are you showing off? Provetti, the visit is over. Provetti won't serve 20 years! He won't! He won't serve 20 years! You don't know him! I understand your embarrassment. You contributed greatly to his indictment. You were promoted because of it. - How dare you? What are you insinuating? I did my job. If he's found guilty, tough luck! What can I do? He's always been a criminal. He is. But he didn't commit that crime. And you know that very well. Dad! Doctor! I'm here! - Polidori. What's that bag? - It's cheap here. While I waited… You came to locate Maria's brother, not to do your groceries. Did you find him? He's in there. Are we here for the Provetti case again? No. We came to buy artichokes. Giovanni De Santis? - Why? Police. I need to ask you a few things. - About? Are you Maria De Santis' brother? - Yes. You were the first one in her room. - So what? Did you find a letter, a statement she left? No. Are you sure? - Let me work. There might be an innocent man in jail. - Who would that be? Provetti. I don't know if he's innocent. But he's a filthy man. He ruined my family. Led my sister to suicide. But if he hasn't committed this crime? Who told you? My sister paid. That poor madwoman. He must pay too. I understand you, De Santis. If my sister had died in such a tragic manner, I would've probably done the same. I know you're not inclined to help Provetti, as he deserves to be in jail. He shouldn't go free and ruin people. But I can't judge him based on the past. Rest assured that he'll eventually pay for it all. For your sister too. I'm a police commissioner. I made a mistake, and I must fix it. If Provetti didn't do it, I must find the true culprit. And you must help justice. I have helped justice. By letting an innocent man go to jail? Who cares? I didn't find any letters. I get it. I thought you were different. But you're just as filthy. You're trying to provoke but it's not going to work. He's never going to talk. No, he won't. Who was that? - Someone who tried to trick me. You're too involved. He's a repeat felon. He doesn't deserve it. Who cares who Provetti is? Did the girl kill the professor? Did the doorman see them leave the hotel together that night? I don't understand what else you intend to do now. I'll ask the doorman to identify Maria's body and reopen the case. You go home! - Why? You can't come with that bag full of artichokes! Get real, Polidori! Get lost! Bellboy! Thank you, Sir. - Listen, Gargiulo. Gargiulo no longer works here. Where does he work now? In an international travel agency, Air Lines. Very nice. Police. Commissioner Dante Lombardozzi. Have you hired an Ettore Gargiulo? Gargiulo? Yes. - Never mind, there he is. What is Colonel Di Pietro, the bearded man, doing here? Di Pietro is our CEO. Dear Lombardozzi, good to see you. Good to see you. I see you've forgotten and forgiven my rough manners. Rough? You almost sprained my shoulder. I apologize, but sometimes I don't realize how strong I am. That's OK. How can I help you today? I'm here to question one of your employees. Why here? We can talk in my office. I'm in a hurry. - What is this about? A new investigation? - No. You're very active. - It's my job. Please, sit down. Thank you. It's about the investigation on your brother's death, which is still open. You see, Colonel, the late Professor Di Pietro treated himself to a diversion, if we may call it so. A diversion? - A bit of entertainment. He went with a "fun" person. I don't get it. - One of "those", Colonel! She died, and that's why I'm here. Gargiulo saw them together that night. His testimony might help to clear an unlucky man. Send Gargiulo in. Come in, Gargiulio. Commissioner Lombardozzi says that you know something that could be extremely important. I demand that you make yourself available to him. You know as in the army. Army people love justice and truth above all. Thank you, Colonel. You told me that on the night of the 20th, the late Di Pietro left the hotel and there was a car waiting, with a red-haired woman inside, whom you know well, I say this because he described her in detail. That woman has died. You must come and identify her. It'll only take a few minutes, but it'll be very useful for the case. I want to help justice, but with what I know. I know nothing of this. Did you not see Di Pietro leave the hotel on the night of the 20th? Of course I did. Wasn't there a car outside? - Yes, there was a car. Wasn't there a woman in the car? - No. Who was in it? - There was… …a man. - A man? With red hair? Red, green, yellow. I don't recall. I didn't see. Gargiulo, I order you to tell the truth. Colonel, you have been like a father to me. You have given me this job, which I don't want to lose. I wouldn't lie to you. The commissioner is mistaken. All I knew… But you did tell me! Now you're taking it back. I know how to help you remember! Commissioner, how dare you intimidate a witness? It's a felony. - Silencing a witness is too! We're not silencing anybody here! - No? But you're hiring illiterate people and giving them great wages. You will hear from your seniors. Do you know what my brother did from 8:00 to 10:00 that night? Why don't you tell me? I want to know. He took part in a preliminary meeting for the convention. Who was with him? I need names. They are all here in my diary. Myself. - You. Colonel Di Pietro. General Tuccio Lefevre. - General Tuccio Lefevre. Professor Cerioni. - Professor Cerioni. Grand Officer Piccirilii. - Grand Officer Piccirilli. Baron Pilosto. - Baron Pilosto. His Excellency Pinzipenna. - His Excellency Pinzipenna. Cavaliere Montemuro. - Cavaliere Montemuro. Professor Mario Gazzara. - Professor Mario Gazzara. Come on. Hurry up. Get out. Come on, hurry. Sergeant Polidori! - Come on. Easy. We need to handle this with kid gloves. This way, gentlemen. May I call my lawyer? - This is not America. Please, follow me. They clearly agreed to distort the truth. Please. What's gotten into you? Do you want me to arrest two ex-MPs, a hot shot from the university, a general, an eminent clinician, without any evidence whatsoever? I've been doing this job for 30 years. Had I indicted all of the liars I came across, the penitentiaries of the whole country wouldn’t have been enough to hold them! What now? What are you doing? Nothing. I'm biting my hand. A nervous reaction to my irritation. Don't worry. I don't worry. You need to calm down! - What are you laughing at? What is he laughing at? - Are we back in school? We can't laugh anymore? Calm down! What are you doing now? It's the Di Pietro file. This is my movie membership. Put it back! The truth is… that all this happened because they want to hide a normal, illicit, sexual encounter had by a man all consider an extremely honest sociologist. What are you rambling about, Lombardini? It's Lombardozzi. What? - My name is Lombardozzi! It's the same. - No, no, it's Lombardozzi! Lombardini, don't forget that we live in an era of fake morals. I told you to stay in your place, because our actions will have consequences. I'm ready to face them! Then go! - Yes. Our job is over. It's now up to the Prosecutor. How stubborn! What's this? "My beloved, I beg you to forgive me." It's a letter to my fiancée who left me because of my job. Go away, you, your letter and your fiancée! Out! Out! - Yes. Commendatore, did you see his look? He seems a bit crazy. A bit crazy and frenzied. But he's meticulous and is partly right. They are indeed a bunch of liars, and I'd have loved to put them behind bars. Hello? It's the chief! Yes, Commendatore. Thank you. Thank you. You and your wife are very kind. You must forgive me, but I must turn down your invitation. I'm very busy. Yes, You're right. I am in a bad mood too. Thank you again. Dear Polidori, I worked too hard. I was wrong before and am wrong now. The boss is right, I went too far. And Provetti is right, it's my fault. Your fault? - Yes. Partly. Tell me the truth, Polidori. Do you believe my version of the story? Partly. Let's hope the Court believes it. If you don't believe me, knowing everything, how can the Court? With no evidence, no witnesses. Or worse, with hostile witnesses. Provetti has no way out. - Good. Do you sleep at night? - Like a baby. I hear hooves. - What? Lucky you. The Judge. This court is now sitting. Criminal proceedings against Provetti, Armando, born in Rome on April 3, 1930, accused of the murder of Simeone Di Pietro. (THE LAW IS EQUAL FOR ALL) Guards, let the defendant approach. Sit down. Provetti, did you hear the charge? You confessed to the investigating magistrate. Do you stand by that? No, I withdraw it. What? I withdraw it. It's not true. He's withdrawing it. What does he think he's doing? You gave an accurate and detailed statement. They forced me to confess. They beat me! Lousy criminal! Who would've beaten him? He's trying to save himself. But who does he hope to fool? They kicked me and hit me. They killed me. Who has beaten you? Come on, young man. The name. Who was this violent person? Go on, Provetti, don't be afraid. Tell us the name. Nobody is going to hurt you in this court. Nobody is going to beat you. You can speak. Commissioner Lombardozzi! He's crazy! Your Honor, considering the defendant's personality and morals, we are not surprised by his statement. And we will proceed to prove it's untrue. All right. Now then, Commissioner Lombardozzi will be summoned. Your Honor, Lombardozzi is before the Court. Is Lombardozzi here? - Yes, Your Honor. Come forward. The witness has been called by the accused. Come forward. The Prosecutor agrees. I hope the Defense has no objections. No objections. Come forward. Are you Commissioner Lombardozzi? Commissioner Dante Lombardozzi, second department, central police station. You will be sworn in. - He's in trouble. Maybe it's true. He wouldn't do that. - Who knows? You can never be sure, with a guy like him. Sit down. You get up. Stay here, where are you going? Go on, Provetti, repeat what happened to Commissioner Lombardozzi. Come on, speak. He broke into my unit illegally. He shut the door and started to hit me to get a confession. He said, "Don't take it back or I'll beat you again and again!" I got scared and confessed. I lost it completely. The infirmary has my certificate. You can check. He beat me up all right. He hit me and broke my superciliary arch. My mouth was bleeding, my ear bruised. I couldn't speak. I was all swollen. They wrote down epilepsy, but I never had epilepsy. Even when I was in the army, they said I was physically and mentally healthy. I was a rifleman! Provetti, look at his face. Is this the man who beat you? Is it him? It's him. Commissioner Lombardozzi, you're a law-enforcement officer. You're a police commissioner and you appreciate how serious the defendant's allegations are. We are, thus expecting that your evidence, which will be recorded, shall shed light on these events. The defendant is pleading not guilty and accusing you of extorting the confession. Commissioner, your words will be critical for Provetti's fate. Did you extort the confession? I did. Did you really beat the defendant? Yes, Your Honor. What is this confession worth then? It's true! I am innocent! I'm innocent! I won! The truth has triumphed! Clear the court! Silence! Please, silence! Go. Thank you. - The hearing's adjourned. The judge will go into his chamber to deliberate. My son, what have they put you through? Your mother knew you were innocent! My son! They are bad people! You ruined your career. I wasn't meant to be a police commissioner. Final results for the 3rd race. Give me 40,000. I was lucky. Fourth place, Ulna. Time 28:54. It's occupied! - No! What are you doing? TOILET Help! Now you can say I beat you up. Dante? Marisa. That's the end of the story, of Dante Lombardozzi, police commissioner. When Marisa, such a good hearted woman, said, "So, are you coming to my parents?" I didn't want to come in this state. I'm alone in the world. You're no longer alone. Don't cry now, you have a mother. Thank you. When I was nine… - Please eat. Wow, he's really hungry! Do you really love him? - I do, Dad. I'm 30, Dad. What are you going to do, now that you quit your job? I have a degree. When I was nine… - Eat up. I'm sure we'll find you a job in our company, right, Mom? Of course. - Thank you. In the police force, we were a nice family. But this one is better. - I bet it is. Is that Grandpa? - Yes. Are you finished?
