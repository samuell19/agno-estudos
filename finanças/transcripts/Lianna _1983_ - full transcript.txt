I've, you know, gone places since I married him. I'm not who I was. He's still Bobby ballgame. You always say how good he is with the kids. Well, that's his life, relating to children. They may be 20 years old and break the eastern conference passing record, but they're still little boys. Extended adolescence in America. Right. I wanted to ask what's-her-name, professor Brennan about that in class last night. I get shy. What do you mean? Well, I'm just in awe of any woman around here who isn't typing her husband's doctoral thesis. Thanks. No, I didn't mean-- I've still got the calluses. When Bob was in junior college I used to have to tutor his entire starting defensive line. All together? Guards on Monday, tackles on Wednesday, and this 350-pound center every Friday. It's true! And he fell in love with me, this guy, Willie Joe Purvis. I knew it the minute he started calling me "Sandy" instead of "Mrs. Coach." What happened? What do you mean, "what happened?" He was in love with the coach's wife. That's like having carnal designs on the virgin Mary. He passed his exams and he made all-state junior college. What's so funny? I keep flashing on him sitting in your kitchen with the shoulder pads on, mooning like a calf when you come in. You're a real sport, lianna. You think your kids are out yet? Probably, we better go see. Woman: * maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong ♪ ♪ maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong ♪ ♪ nevertheless, I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose ♪ ♪ maybe I'm in for crying the blues ♪ ♪ nevertheless, I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ somehow I know at a glance the terrible chances I'm taking ♪ ♪ fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking ♪ ♪ maybe I'll live a life of regret ♪ ♪ maybe I'll give much more than I get ♪ ♪ nevertheless, I'm in love with... you... ♪ Man: I've heard people complaining about Flaherty staging his footage, about how this is some kind of betrayal, that there's such a thing as "pure" documentary. Well, there's a law in physics that the act of observing an event can't help but change that event, and a documentary filmmaker not only observes, but edits. Now, I'm sure you've been wondering all through class what this, uh, little message on the board is all about. Take a good look. "Allowing your workers to be swayed by such propaganda, you are surrendering them to the forces that have kept eastern Europe in chains for three decades, the evil forces of the world, communist conspiracy. These people are ruthless, they have nothing to lose. But if we unite behind the banners of christianity and democracy, they cannot prevail." Who do you suppose wrote that? Woman: Jerry falwell. Woman 2: Reverend moon? Well, the fact of the matter is, it doesn't make any difference. This is just our raw footage. First we select the parts we want to keep. Anything that doesn't agree with our idea of what the story should be, it goes on the cutting room floor. There we go. Now, we change the order of our bits of film, taking it out of real time and into film time, and splice them together for effect... And now what do we have? "Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains." But that's distortion. That's lying. Yadda-yadda-yadda, that's all, folks. See you Thursday. Lianna: I came to pick you up. I noticed. I know you don't like me coming into the classroom, but I was afraid you'd get stuck in a conversation with some eager beaver student if you didn't see I was here. Uh-huh. What's the matter, afraid to let them see you playing husband? Are the kids in the car? I didn't think you'd want me to bring them in. Thank you. Sodium phosphate, sodium ascorbate, sodium carbonate... Girl: Do I have to eat my peas? >> Calcium carbonate... Yes. Why? Because I am bigger than you are, that's why. Spence, what's that you're chattering at us? I brought the boxes from everything we ate yesterday into consumer affairs class. This is what we've been eating. Disodium inosinate, disodium... What did we do to deserve him? We learned they were supposed to grow out of it by the time they were 18. >> Citric acid... You going tonight? Mm-hmm. I've got to pick Sandy up in a little while. Bob is using their car. ...partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. How long before you're 18, Spence? Five years. Dextrose... I think I'll start scratching the days on the wall like the count of monte cristo! ...cheese culture, carob bean gum... I thought that was really good in class, about the editing. Oh, yeah. They were going on about the purity of documentary film the other day. Thought I'd shake the little bastards up a bit. Can I eat in front of the TV? There's a movie I want to see. No, finish your dinner. But the movie'll be over in an hour or so. The food'll still be here. No. >> how's your honors class coming? It's not an honors class. There isn't a film major. How's it going anyhow? My best student is doing her thesis on audie Murphy, America's tragic hero. That's my best. Spencer, go eat in front of the TV, quick. Girl: Do I have to eat my peas? Yes. >> Why? Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to clam up and eat. Professor Brennan said that they had the same trouble with child psychology at first. All the least practical students wanted to get into it. That's right, she's a professor. What's that mean? Child psych is an easy ride. She must've got into it when it was getting respectable. Don't be jealous. When you get tenure... The only way I get tenure is if a half-dozen old farts in the English department bite the dust. They'd be crazy to pass you over. You know who they want me to teach next semester? William Dean howells. They wouldn't do that to someone they were expecting to keep. Girl: Do I have to eat my peas? Yes, theda. You have to eat your peas. Why? What is this, the riddle of the sphinx? Have the peas changed from what they were three minutes ago? They got a half-life or something? Spence, what's that you got on in there? Spence: It's called battleground. It's a William wellman we're doing next week. I better give it a look. [Gunshots and explosions continue from TV] Don't you want to go watch the movie? No, I want to stay here with you. I'll eat half your peas. Good. How many is that? I thought you were counting. No, you have to. Now you got to start from the beginning. Monkey, you'll have me here all night. Let's start from 50, o.K.? O.k. Betty, we haven't heard anything from you. What do you think? I've never read anything about it, or maybe I have and forgot. Well, what do you think? How many children do you have? Five. Oldest is 18. And they're all pretty good kids? >> Yeah. Well, they didn't get that way all by themselves. I've got as much to learn from you as you have from me. Now, how would you say being in a big family has affected your children? Oh, they can blow off steam on each other without turning it all on me. And then sometimes they're like friends with each other, which is nice. That makes me feel good. And when herb and me fight, well, I think the bunch of them can absorb it a lot better than if there was just one. We'll be hollerin' and they come out to complain we're drowning out their TV show. I have a question on that. Yes. Um, if the parents of a child are having problems, and let's say they're really careful to, you know, not fight in front of the child... do you think it's possible that the child won't be affected? If I had an ex-husband or a lover who you all knew about, and you knew we were having a real rocky time with each other, and he started coming into class, just sitting-- not saying anything, just being here, watching me all through class-- how would you feel when you walked in here? Little knots in the stomach. Exactly, and you're not even my children. Sandy: I think you've got a crush on her. What? Oh, I don't mean a Willie Joe Purvis crush. I mean the kind that Ellie and theda have on their teacher Mrs. Strack. Oh, come on, Sandy. I'm really interested in the subject. Uh-huh. For Christ's sake, I am 33 years old. I don't have crushes. * teacher's pet, I wanna be teacher's pet. ♪ Give me a break, come on! I'm out at class two nights a week, two lousy nights. What's wrong with that? Nothing. It's just that you said you didn't have time to look that stuff up for me. It isn't the time. I said I'd be too tired. I'm interested in this, so it won't be tiring. You're not interested in what I do? I'm interested in what you do. But I'm not interested in looking up who is the assistant clapper boy on the silent version of a star is born. They didn't have clapper boys on silent pictures. The purpose of the clap is to register on the soundtrack. You know what I mean. When I'm really excited about something it gives me more energy. Energy, huh? Want to work some of it off with your old man? I'll go put the thing in. The counselor said we should try to do more things together, so Bob offered to come shopping. It wasn't exactly what I had in mind. Well, at least he's willing to try. Are you going to the party at the loomises tonight? No. I get nervous there ever since Ellie broke her collarbone on the jungle gym. I doubt the festivities will use the backyard. You weren't at their last party. Some little grad student chased Jerry Carlson out of the teeter-totter. Did she catch him? Jerry knows when to slow down. So I've heard. Anyway, we have class tonight, remember? Dick's gonna want me to be at the party. He thinks my missing so many makes it looks like we're having trouble, and that's bad for his standing in the department. Oh, I hate that. You would think how he was in class would be enough. Doesn't Bob want you to go with him? Bob? He hates faculty parties worse than I do. He always ends up with his back against the wall, explaining why football gets a bigger budget than women's track. Why does it? Shh! Man: It is a delicate piece of machinery. You treat it well, it'll treat you well. Today we're going... What's up? You wanted me to let you know if I was coming tonight or not. You weren't in your office. So? I want to go to class, o.K.? It's your time. Please, don't get mad. I get to miss one of these things once in a while, don't I? I'm not mad. It's just that I think that once in a while-- lianna, hi. Come on with us. We're gonna shoot some footage. You can be our star. The last star was a cockroach. Is that character still following you around? Uh-huh. Are you going to the party tonight? I don't think so. If you don't come, who am I gonna corner in the kitchen? From what I hear you'll find somebody. Oh, children, children. They're mere children. I need a mature woman, someone who has seen enough of life to appreciate me. You need a cold shower. And maybe that one from child psych will be there. I can talk to her about my early experiences, my blankie, my Teddy bear, my first wet dream. My parents had it bronzed, you know. You're out of luck, Jerry. She's teaching class tonight. That's where lianna's going. The night school thing, right. Maybe I should come with you. I could lecture on the plight of the unwed father. She said we could bring children if we didn't have a sitter around. Ahh! You just blew your film career. Hi. I... I wrote down these short stories. They have to do with children. You've probably read most of them, but if you haven't, I thought they might be good to use in a course sometime or... Thank you. I'm not familiar with most of these. You read a lot? I started out as an English major. Started out? What did you end up as? A wife. Aw, come on. A mother? I do stage lighting for a dance company, as a volunteer. I take classes. This is my favorite one so far. Thank you. You know, I was wondering, on your study, if you need any kind of an assistant or... Are you interested? Uh-huh. Good. We should talk about it... have dinner or something. Sure. See you. I'll drop you at the loomises after class? No. It's just up the hill. I'll cut through backyards. Be careful. In this neighborhood? No, I mean once you get to the loomises'. Who know what point they'll have reached? Yeah, I'll try and stay off the jungle gym. Woman: O.k., here I come! Woman: Ooh! [General conversations, party music continue...] Woman: Oh! Dick: Cheer up, cheer up, Gail. Gail: Where do I start? Oh, come on... How was class? I got out early. Oh? I figured the party would still be going. Hmm? But I didn't feel like going anymore and I came home. Oh. How was the party? O.k., I guess. The usual. A lot of students, like always at the loomises', trying to score their brownie points. Mm-hmm. How many do you get for a fuck in the sandbox? Huh? Brownie points. How many do you get for a fuck in the sandbox? Lianna: ...You promised me! Dick: Oh, come on, lianna! You promised me you weren't going to do that again. You lie to me and you lie to me! We were just playing around! You are so full of shit! Don't talk to me that way! I'll talk to you any goddamn way I want to! You're gonna wake the kids up. ...says to write about something and so I wrote a play instead of a story, and it's called the Thanksgiving Turkey. "The Thanksgiving Turkey. I think it's fine that everybody comes together at Thanksgiving. But aren't you worried, Tom? I mean, about dinner? Why should I be? I love to eat." And then I say my part, you don't seem to get it, Tom Turkey. You are for dinner on Thanksgiving. It's going to be you they gobble up. What? They're going to eat me? Why didn't you tell me before? When is the next train out of here?" Theda, honey, could you read that a bit later? Your father's got a headache. O.k. Yeah, that time, you see, you walked so far away that I had to... sort of go like that to stay with you. Think of it more as down than away, and then add away. Am I supporting you here? No, just lean. [Conversation continues, indistinct] When they're through, stick reds in all the ones along the back wall. You got it. Man: What do you think? Woman: Nope. Lianna? Lianna, hi. Profess-- Ruth! Don't look so surprised. It's just the first time I've seen you out of context. Out of context, am I? Hmm. What are you looking for? Here? Um, just browsing around. I don't think I'll buy anything. Sometimes when I'm depressed it helps just to look at stuff. You mind if I join you? Being depressed? Browsing. In my freshman year, it was still a bit of a scandal. We both agreed it would be awkward for him being married to a student, so I stopped being a student. Gets pretty complicated sometimes. I read your book. Oh-- it wasn't required for the course. I liked it a lot. Thank you. Did you... Ever want kids of your own? That's just one of those things that never worked out for me. Is there anything that you always wanted to do that you haven't done? What? Nothing... just a thought. Come on, what is it? I don't know. Lots of things. ...did you pack the aspirin? Aspirin? Last time you went to a film festival, you got a headache during the eastern Europeans and nobody had any aspirin to spare. Right, I'll take some. Are you going to be staying in the same place? No, it was full already, but they're all the same. It'll give us time to think, lianna. We had time to think after the last time this happened, remember? Look, if I were going to leave you, I wouldn't start by going to Toronto. So don't worry, o.K.? No, I won't. ...so, besides being bright and witty and looking like one of Charlie's angels, what else is your new English teacher like? Is she married? No, she lives with a guy. How do you know that? She told us. Seems like a strange thing to tell a junior high class. It's no big deal. I mean, it's not like back in your day. My day. As far as I'm concerned, it still is my day. I won't argue with you. How old is she? 26-- she said she just got her master's. Probably did her thesis on Jerry Lewis. Thomas man, whoever he is. Mahn. Theda, dinner's ready. Coming! How'd she end up telling you all this? She said she wanted us to be open and honest with her and it wouldn't be fair if she wasn't the same with us. With ideas like that, how'd she end up teaching in public school? The pay was better. She's starting at 12,000 a year. What's her bra size? Mommy! She doesn't wear one. Spencer! Hey, she just asked me. Don't be such a prude. All right, you guys, I want you to clean up the dishes when you're through. I'm going upstairs to change. About time we had a change around here. Save those for what's-her-name. I'm sure they'll go over big. Theda: No... Yes. They don't. They couldn't. They do-- everyone does. You're just saying that to get me. Hey, did I write this book? Did I draw these pictures? They're just drawings. Here-- photographs. Oh, gross. I'm gonna be sick. That's what they do-- you might as well get used to it. Like that? With their tongues? Ick... Everyone does it, even mom and dad. Lianna: You guys ready? Sandy'll be here any minute. I'm not going. Theda's going and you're going. Ellie is theda's best friend. There's nothing for me to do there. You can play with Tex. Tex is two years old. He'll be in bed. Well... Bob likes you. Every time he sees me, he pinches my arm muscle and asks me if I know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is. Come on, I'm old enough to stay home without a babysitter. We'll ask your father when he gets home. What's the matter with you? Can't you make a decision by yourself? You watch your tongue with me, Spencer. No. Another evening with knute rockne, all-American. Spencer... >> He'll probably make me lift weights. He's got 'em, you know, every shape and size. They're all in the cellar. It's like a torture chamber down there... All right, you can stay, but... keep the doors locked and don't use the stove for anything, you hear? It's probably Sandy. It's her. Come on, theda! Don't keep her waiting! Liar... she never did that. Theda and Spencer? Theda's for theda bara and Spencer's for Spencer Tracy. Dick was already getting into his movie thing when we had Spence. And Spencer's how old? 13. He's in the monkey gland stage. He's all hot and bothered about this young girl teacher who's come in. Hmm... are you jealous? I guess I am a little. Well, it's not an age where he's likely to want his mother to be his best friend. I'll get you some more. Thanks. My mother really was my best friend for the longest time. I wasn't hers, thank god, but I know she liked my company. I'd pretend we were sisters. Is your mother still living? Up in alberta. We offered to find her a place down here, but all she can think of is street creeps and the son of Sam. >> she plays a lot of bridge and calls me once a week. Were you pretty when you were a girl? I looked like I'd been raised these big staring eyes and pale skin. Well, you're very pretty now. Thank you. More than anything else in the whole wide world... I wanted to be pro basketball player. >> You're kidding. Oh, it was so exciting-- all those beautiful arms and legs, everybody sweating, all the drama... I used to get tingles watching the games. Tingles? You know, tingles. I wasn't sure quite what they were, but I knew I shouldn't tell the nuns about them. I think being an adult is realizing that you're never gonna make the celtics. I grew up the day after I got married. >> Really? Mm-hmm. It's funny. Just a ceremony, nothing physical, but it really can change the way you look at things. I guess if you haven't been through it, it's hard to fathom... >> I've been married. You have? One whole year. What happened? It was just a mistake. We said "I'm sorry" to each other and went on to other things. Oh. So how was it different after you were married? ...my biggest fantasy was to build a raft which actually floated. I was always making these rafts out of 2x4s, climbing on them and getting soaked. Did you have a lot of crushes on boys when you were that age? I suppose-- don't all the girls? >> Do they? You're the child expert. Right. Do you remember your first crush? My first crush... I used to go to camp up north in the summer. There was this one counselor. She was... 15, maybe 16. I was so glad when I got her squad. She taught us field hockey. I had a sort of crush on her. No... I was in love with her. The girl I bunked with, her name was Virginia dobbs. She was skinny. About as unattractive as I was. She discovered that this counselor was sneaking out of the cabin late every night, so we started following her. She'd meet this guy. He was a lifeguard from the boys camp-- he came in a canoe. Virginia and I hid by the boathouse and we watched them on this little strip of beach. We could see his bare bottom shining white in the moonlight. I couldn't believe her breasts. We kept trying not to giggle. Not that we thought anything was funny, just that nervous kind of giggling when you're scared and fascinated at the same time. When we got back to the cabin... Virginia and I would slip under the covers together in the bottom bunk-- my bunk-- and we'd cuddle and whisper... And Virginia would show me how they did it. >> and it was like playing at first... Virginia calling out the lifeguard's name... Then we'd start to get excited and I'd pretend Virginia had breasts. I haven't thought about that in a really long time. [Mix of female voices whispering indistinctly in English and French ...] [Faint moaning and sighing, whispering continues...] Touch me... Touch me... Touch me... touch me... Lianna... Yes... yes... Yes... Do you sleep with a lot of women? A lot? No. I've been at it a while, though. This is my first. No... >> how you doing? Great. You sleepy? No. What time is it? 3:30. Oh, my god. What's wrong? I let Spencer stay home alone-- he'll know if I don't come back! He must be asleep by now. Oh, no... oh, god, I hope so... what if he fell asleep and left the oven on or if Sandy called and I'm still not home... Sandy calls you this late? No, but there's always a chance... Oh, god... I'm panicking, aren't I? Just a little. Don't worry, there's nothing written indelibly on your face. No one has to know. I still have to get home. Ruth... >> Hmm? When you first touched me on the couch... Were you sure that I'd want... I had a feeling, but I wasn't sure. Were you scared? Terrified. If I had been wrong and it got around class... Well... a lot of people overreact. Why did you take the chance? I really wanted you. I wanted you that much. I'm so glad. Mom... Spencer, you scared me. What are you doing up? I was just watching the late movies. Mm-hmm. Well, they go on all night, you know. Well, it didn't seem like you were gonna get home after it got to be 1:00. Well, these research projects... get pretty complicated sometimes. Professor Brennan had a lot of details to explain to me. We got pretty... Wrapped up in it. What was on? Oh, uh... battleground. It's a war movie. I thought you saw that last week. Well, I missed the beginning. I saw it from the start tonight. Then this other one came on. Japanese horror flick... You better get to bed. You've got school tomorrow. I'll turn the TV off. No, no, I'll get it. My god, he's had an orgy. ...smoked oysters, artichoke hearts, imported chocolate... Oh, my god, macadamia nuts! Ruth: Huh? This is all the stuff you can't afford on a family budget. My one big indulgence. I started when I gave up smoking. What do Portuguese cuttlefish taste like? Try one. Look like squid. Huh? I said it's fun eating over at your house. Why don't you call your children and ask if you can stay for dinner? Lianna: Hi. Hi. I wish I could touch you. If we were at the beach, we could play with suntan lotion. Be nice to hold hands or something. I haven't held hands with anyone in years. >> Mm-hmm. I want to kiss you. Can't here-- that's part of the package. We should go to a beach where no one can see us. We will sometime. When? Sometime. Ruth? Mm-hmm? I'm kissing you. I'm kissing you back. I'm touching the back of your neck with my lips... lightly. You can feel my breath warm against your neck. You can feel my tongue... My teeth... You feel my fingertips brushing the backs of your legs... Soft... on the tender parts. Now sliding up the insides of your thighs. When do your kids get out? 3:00. Would you like to come home with me right now? Yes, I would. And this is Spence. He's giving the camera his "leave me alone" look. That was taken a couple of months ago. He looks older than 13 here. Well, actually, he's been 13 for six years now. They're keeping him back till he finally does it right. How does he get on with dick? Lately not so well. They both have the same kind of sense of humor and it gets to be a battle for the spotlight. Neither one wants second billing to the other's act. Dick wins, of course. He gets back tonight? Mm-hmm. And we have to be at a party-- typical. An English department thing. I thought I'd try and make a gesture by going with him. Are you gonna tell him about us? I don't think so. Who are these people? Some of Jerry karlson's students-- he gave them an assignment to come here and shoot whatever was interesting. >> I think they're wasting their time with this bunch. From what I hear, they should have been at the loomises' last party. Mm-hmm... Women on recording: * he will play the pinball 10 times straight ♪ ♪ one thin dime always kept him up late ♪ ♪ Mr. Cool, what's there to do when there's no work and there's no school? ♪ ♪ Mr. Cool... ♪ ...the girl obviously can't drink. [General conversation, song continues indistinctly...] It's the point where film and reality intermingle, the point where the celluloid is life, but at the same time it's more than life, it's more than a reflection of life. It becomes hard to tell whether events and attitudes in the real world are influencing what goes on the screen or the other way around. Take the case of audie Murphy... You're the one! What? You're the one-- my husband told me. He did? Audie Murphy. Oh... oh, my thesis. Audie Murphy. Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier in world war ii. He was a simple, honest, hometown boy who was brought to Hollywood and dragged through the whole bit. The marriages, the money problems, the low-budget pictures, the publicity gimmicks, and finally... That symbolic plane crash. He's America's perfect tragic hero. He's the tragic hero of your generation. My generation? Try again. James Dean? Give me a break. Elvis. Well, tragic hero might be going a little far, but you're getting closer in the age department. What was your name again? Kim. My friends call me Kimmy. Perfect. I mean, it was sort of my responsibility to stay. I'm sorry, I thought you might want to come home and talk to me. I thought you'd be tired from your trip. I am tired, but it's part of my job, you know that. Parties are where all the teacher evaluation goes on. You're exaggerating. I'm not ex... Forget it. So, what did you do with yourself while I was off viewing Lithuanian masterpieces? Nothing. I had an affair. Oh... Congratulations. Anyone I know? Not really. Good. Jerry karlson was acting kind of strange tonight. I'd hate to think that he had anything on me. An affair, huh? Feel like you've gotten even? That's not why it happened. Was it worth it? Was it the man of your dreams? It wasn't a man. Huh? I said it wasn't a man. What's so funny? You've come a long way from alberta. How was it? Like a drugstore paperback? None of your business. I don't see what you're feeling so humorous about. Well, it's just different than if it had been a man. Why? She touched me the same way... I don't want to hear what you did in bed, damn it. Who is it? Ruth Brennan. Aha... The pieces fall into place. I always thought there was something fishy about her. There's nothing fishy about her. She engaged in an unnatural act with my wife-- I think that's pretty damn fishy. Professor Brennan, huh? That's right. So you're still fucking your teachers. And you're still fucking your students. At least they're the right sex. What did she do, come on to you after class, offer you a friendly shoulder to cry on? Tell me-- I'm interested in how they operate. Who's "they"? The campfire girls-- who the hell do you think I mean? Why are you being this way? You're making everything worse. What the hell, you said it was no big thing. I never said that, dick. It is a big thing? I know it's probably never occurred to you, but it is possible that I might fall in love with somebody. With somebody else. With somebody. Well, don't let me stand in your way. I don't intend to. You gonna keep seeing her? If she wants me to. The hell you are! Not while you're living with me. O.k., if that's what you want, we'll get a separation. Where do you think you're gonna live? How do you think you're gonna support yourself? What do you mean? Move in with the professor if you want, whatever... But I want you out of here tomorrow. >> The hell I will. Did you ever consider what the kids are gonna think? Or our friends and neighbors here in faculty land? You're not telling the kids. No. I'll leave that up to you. You'll have to think of something to explain why you're moving out. Why are you being this way? You've given me a perfect escape route, honey. I'm taking it, that's all. You fucker, you prick... That's it, lianna, let it all out. You always have to win, don't you? And if you lose, you make the other person lose more. Very good-- your psych classes are finally paying off. Must be all that private tutoring. You made up your mind in Toronto, didn't you? You came back to ask for a separation and then I dumped it right in your lap. I did a lot of thinking while I was in Toronto. You're not taking the kids from me, dick. That depends on you and whether you're a true convert to the fold or just hot for the first friendly piece of ass... God damn you! I'll hit you back, lianna! I will! No matter how much you think you can hurt me, I can hurt you more! Understand? For a woman... Sandy: Professor Brennan? Mm-hmm. An affair? Yes. You mean like a love affair? Yes. Oh, god. What's the matter? Well, i'm... I'm just... surprised. I... how did... What did you do? What do you mean? We got to know each other and... You know... It happens. You're not... Telling dick, are you? He knows. I have to see if I can stay with Ruth. What are you gonna do if you can't? I haven't thought that far. Tex, get off that. I hope you get to know her, Sandy-- she's really wonderful. Yeah... Uh-huh... Ruth? Hi. We've got to talk. I told him. >> Oh, my god... I'm moving out. I told him, we had a fight and he kicked me out. Where are you gonna stay? Well, I thought with you... For a while, anyway. Oh, lianna, we can't do that. This is worse than a small town here. I've got to work with these people. You think it would hurt you? I have to talk parents here into letting me run psych experiments with their children. What do you think would happen if word got out about it? I guess I haven't thought it all out. Right now I want to put my arms around you. If we were straight friends, I would have. But that's not the way the world works. What am I gonna do? I don't know. I... what did you think was gonna happen when you told him? It felt right. Oh, honey... I'll do what I can but... I really wasn't ready for this. I thought when I found somebody, everything would be all right. Oh, lianna... We're gonna live apart... And that's what we decided was best for everybody. We just want you to know... That... We still love you as much as we did before. This isn't gonna change that, o.K.? It's a problem between the two of us... and... You have to be understanding... And help us to work it out. But why do you have to leave? It's the way your father and I decided to do it. I'm not leaving. See me every day if you want. Why can't I come with you? Because I need some time alone to think about everything, honey. And I'm gonna be busy. I'll be out looking for a job. Why doesn't dad support you? Isn't that the law? We wanted to do this our own way. It's not gonna be as bad as it seems right now... I promise. You'd better go in. Your father's waiting to talk to you. Why can't I stay with you? You can't, honey... Not for a while. Now, try to help me with this, o.k., please? Do what I ask you. You a student? No. A teacher? No... I go to night school. Do you work? I'll be out looking for work. I'm here to be near my family. You familiar with this neighborhood? No, not really. Well, it's the best you'll find for the sort of rent you have in mind. Can I move in right away? Soon as the ink is dry. First, last and $100 security deposit. No pets or children, like it says in the ad. And I don't want no men up here. I may live across town but I know what goes on. No men. ...I've always wanted a room of my own. ...yes. I've had gas before. I don't know if it was under my name. No... no, it wasn't, but I can give you the address. You what? Good. Good. No, they're putting the phone in now. I don't know what the number's going to be. What? ...i don't know if I'll take this-- they'll be eating a lot of scrambled eggs. I can always buy another one. Let dick do the buying. I don't want to be like that. Suit yourself. I'll go get your bathroom stuff. Hello? Oh, mom, hello. No, nothing's wrong. No, I haven't been in. I wrote you a letter, mom. Probably hasn't got to you. Dick and I... We're separating. No. No, we both decided on it. Ruth: Hi! Hi. I'm helping lianna move her things. I see. Don't let her forget her teapot. She drinks tea after lunch. Right, I'll remind her. Would you like to come in? See you in class? Of course I've got friends. Right, Sandy, I've got Sandy. Listen, mom, you can't afford all this. You've got to save for the plane trip. You'll get my letter... And I'll call you as soon as I get my new phone number, o.K.? Bye, now. You take care... And don't worry. Don't you worry. It's all fine. That's right, Christmas. Bye, mom. Social security number here and at least two references. Thank you. Mm-hmm. How long have you been looking? Only a few days. Well, I hope you hit on something right away. Job market's pretty grim. How long have you been looking? A month and a half. That's terrible. It's this town. All those graduate student wives floating around putting their husbands through school... It overloads the market. There's even faculty wives out looking. They don't need to work, they just... need something to do, like a hobby. The school should take care of their own people and leave the rest of us alone. Yeah, maybe they should. How many words did you type on the test? 73. Ooh... not much hope there. I think they're cutting off at 100. It's like a factory here. Insurance forms? I've gotta do something. Don't we all? And that's when he said she ran off with one of your film students. What else did he say? That's when I popped him. O.k.... you're gonna hear this sooner or later. It might as well be from me. You know how sometimes... You'll have a really good friend, and, uh... They'll be the same sex as you, like you and Richie. Before I busted his face. Yeah. And sometimes people get to be more than friends-- grownups-- and, uh, they live together. You mean like homos. Well, I wouldn't phrase it that way, but... yeah, that's what I'm getting at. And when this happens between women... They're called lesbians. Yeah, that's right. But let's not use that word... O.k.? Theda, do you know what we're talking about? No. O.k., I'm gonna go into this, but I want you to remember that your mother is still the same person she always was. She still loves you the way she always has. It's just... things between her and me that are... different. O.k.? Lianna? Mm-hmm? I think it'd be better if you didn't call me Ruth in class. No? It's sort of a professional thing. I have to keep a certain amount of... I don't know... Not authority, but... Distance? That's not what I mean. I don't know, I guess I'm just nervous. I'll try to remember. At least I haven't called you ruthie. Thank you. I've been thinking about the research... for the book. What about it? I think it'd be better if you didn't do it. Why? I think it'd be better for us. I don't think it's good for you to take another position where you're... subservient to me. Like what? Well, I'm your teacher, I'm older than you... A few years. I have a profession. It's like too many of the things that you said were wrong with you and dick. But I want to help you. Yeah, but I don't feel right having you work for me now that we're lovers. Something feels wrong about it. O.k.... if you think so. Anything else I should know? There's a woman back home. Her name is jan. Are you going back to her? I don't know. We've had our troubles. I don't know what I should ask for. What do you need to make? I just can't afford to do this for free anymore. What if she doesn't have anything in the budget? Then I'll probably be getting a promotion. Ledbetter... Leonard... Lermontov... Lerner... Lesbian. See "homosexual".

I'm taking the kids to see the matinee. Christ. Dick asked me. I guess his work is backed up. He could've called me. He said he didn't want to bother you. My ass. You're helping him get off the hook. Is he supposed to be on one? He keeps doing this big number about how he can provide for the kids himself. They wanted to see a movie. I tried to call you at your new place last night but you weren't in. Listen, I got to get the tickets, it starts in a minute. Hi! Spence: Hi. Hey, what's the matter? You forget me already? Hi, Ellie. Would you take Tex over to your mother for a minute? I want to talk to theda and Spencer, o.K.? Thanks. What is this? Did your father say something about me? God... Theda, honey, let me-- goddamn him. Goddamn him. Spence: She kept asking why it was you who had to move out. She asked him if you were in love with someone else. He had to say something. And what do you say? So my old lady's a dyke, big deal. Spencer! I'm not your old lady, I'm your mother. Sorry. I'll... Talk to you both about it later, o.k.? Yeah, I am sorry. Don't worry about it. Hurry up. You'll miss the coming attractions and I know how you hate to do that. See ya. The children have been given the same questionnaire through their schools. I don't think there's been enough studies made of how values are passed on. Be sure to answer what you believe, not what you think you should believe. This is a survey, not a test. Also, I have to be back at school to clear up some things with my department head, so I won't be here Tuesday session next week. If you can just fill these out and hold onto them, I'll see you next Friday. So, what's this about you leaving? I'm sorry. I didn't decide on it until this morning. You mean you don't really have to go. I... I do. I, uh, have some personal things that I have to deal with. Then this isn't about your department head. Actually, it is. She's who I have to see. It's jan. Oh. I didn't know you worked with her too. I didn't think this was going to happen. I figured you being married and having kids-- what, that I'd be easier to leave? I didn't think that I... I thought I could keep it under control. I'm scared. So am I. Woman on TV: ...That explains the fainting spells... The incidents of blindness. What are you going to do? Man on TV: What can I do? I have to stand by her. After everything she's put you through... She's my wife! But what about Rachel? What are you going to tell her? She'll, she'll have to wait, that's all. She'll understand. She can only wait so long. I have to take that risk. Joan needs me. Jerry: Hi, gorgeous. Jerry, come in! Hi, how you doing? Fine. Hey, you've done a real nice job in here. Thanks. Take a seat. Which one? Would you like a beer or something? Yeah, a beer would be great. O.k. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No, I was just reading. Reading... Oh, yeah, those funny little lines on paper, what they had before film? What are you reading? The well of loneliness. Sounds like a riot. How much do you pay for this? Too much. $275 without the utilities. I was kind of pressed for time. Thank you. So, how's it been? Not too bad. I've been a little lonely lately. I felt it in my bones, that's why I came over. You could make a living with bones like that. You get much sun in here? In the afternoon. It's nice. In the morning it comes in through my bedroom window. Good, I like that. What? I said I like that. It's a nice way to wake up. Oh. Have you been, um, seeing anybody since you and dick had your falling out? If you're asking did I leave him for somebody... No, not really. I should've done it long ago. Good. Jerry, are you intimating what I think you are? I don't intimate, lianna, you know that. I'd like to sleep with you. You don't waste any time, do you? I figure it's been a while since you and dick split, and you said there wasn't another guy involved. You're a grown, healthy woman. I figured I'd come over and... Help me out, like the welcome wagon. Um... You know, I've been interested in you since I've known you and I know you've been interested in me. I'm not interested in you. Not in sleeping with you. I'm sorry if I came at you a little sudden, but... my technique must be getting ragged. I really like you and-- I'm not interested in you, Jerry. Not at all. O.k.? Sure. Welcome wagon knows when it's not welcome. Of course you're welcome. I'm really glad to see you. I just don't want to sleep with you, o.K.? Yeah. So how are your courses going? Have any of your students finished their films? Oh, they're fine, yeah. As a matter of fact, I, I... Should probably go help out in the cutting room tonight, I forgot. I thought you were all set to spend to the night. Well, I got this kid, she's a bit of a loose wind, she could use a hand. Jerry, you don't have to-- I'm sorry, I, I made a mistake. Good night, Jerry. I'll see you around, o.K.? Dick gave me your number. I'll give you a call. Good night. Take care. Excuse me. Got enough soap there? Oh... I'm used to buying for a family. You moved to the second floor, huh? That's right. We're right above you. If it gets too loud, feel free to tell us. I will, thank you. Liz, that's my roommate. Her boyfriend comes over and plays music on our stereo sometimes. He's into volume. I think his eardrums are shot. Does he have to sneak in? Sneak? Oh, our landlady. Mrs. Hennessy talks a good game but she can't back it up. She just comes over to rent a place when it's vacant and scare you with that "no men" rap. Hey, you don't rat on me, I don't rat on you. Oh, I... I... I... I'm gay. Oh. I'm Sheila. What's so funny? Come on, let me in on it. Jesus, you're not gay, you're hysterical. What's so funny? I... I don't know why I said that. I don't even know you. I'm going nuts. It isn't true? Oh, oh, I think it's true. It's true. I'm into men, physically, anyways. Don't apologize. Well, if you'd been through some of the turkeys I have you'd want to apologize too. Gay, huh? Oh, Jesus, Mrs. Hennessy would fall over dead if she found out. I know! I don't think she knows it exists. You'd be surprised. Do you go to school? When I can't find anything better to do. I have a few credits to go. Liz has a b.A. In religion. She's working as a dental technician. What else do you do besides your laundry? I'm looking for work. I just separated from my husband. Oh. Listen, what's your name? Lianna. That's pretty. Anyway, you need anything, uh... A cup of soap, a bucket of sugar, whatever, feel free to call on us. I will, thanks. It stinks. And now I hold all the cards and if you throw a scene in there, I'll have your girlfriend on the witness stand. Goddamn you. Come on. And watch your step. Since your mother has decided to leave home... Lianna: Since I'm leaving your father and this is a faculty house and he's faculty-- although she's left us, your mother will still be visiting. You know if I had my choice I'd be staying with you. We've decided on Thursdays and sundays. You know that, don't you? Hey, there. Hi. How have you been? Business as usual. Is Sandy home? Uh, no, no. She took the kids to get shoes. How you making out over there? Fine, I'm managing. Lianna, uh, Sandy told me what's up with you. Did she? Yeah... and, uh, it doesn't make any difference to me. I mean, it's not the same as... It's different when it's women. She misses you, Sandy does. She does? A lot. She's afraid, though. I don't know. I had a player once, a halfback, a hell of a runner. Anyhow, I found out in the middle of the season that he, uh, you know, he, uh, liked guys. I'd recruited this kid out of high school, watched him develop four years and I had no idea. I mean, he was a black kid. I didn't even know they had 'em that way. The thing was, he was most of our running game and did a good hunk of the receiving. I didn't want to bother him or hurt his concentration, so I never said a thing to him about it. Kept an eye on him, though. You know? Never changed my opinion of the kid, he was still a hell of a kid. Give you 100%, good leader, everything. Goes to show you-- you didn't worry about him walking around in the shower with the other guys? He had more important things on his mind. What? Football. Yuck. Oh, hi. Hi. You were expecting somebody else? I thought it might be another one of my husbands' so-called friends. I've had two calls and a visit so far offering to help me out. Divorce vultures. I remember when my parents split up, my mother was suddenly the most popular girl in town. Would you like to come in? Uh, actually, Liz and I were going to go to a movie over at the college and we thought you might want to come along. Is it "the magnificent ambersons?" You've already seen it. No, but my husband-- it's for his film course. He'll be there to introduce it and lead a discussion group and all that. I really don't want to see him right now, not even in an auditorium. Massey, is that your husband? Have you taken something with him? Uh, no, Liz has. "Religion in cinema". She said he was really good. Oh, he's a really good teacher. As a husband, he leaves something to be desired. I'm sorry, maybe some other time. Well, we were actually just casting around for something to do. Would you like to come up and watch TV or something? Oh, don't let me change your plans. Plans? What plans? Come on, we'll make popcorn. ...Liz, it's all settled. TV and junk food. This is lianna from the laundry room. Lianna, Liz. Hi. Say, "ah." Ahh. Ah, you're from Canada. How'd you guess? Miracle of modern dentistry. Pleased to meet you. You're so quiet down there we thought you moved away. Oh, I'm still there. I thought we'd treat lianna to some fine American cuisine. How does popcorn sound? Sort of like rain falling on a tent. Get into the kitchen, Turkey. It's your turn to cook. I'll have to see what Craig claiborne says about this. Use the mazola, not the olive oil. Have a seat. See what the networks have stacked against us. Liz: Lianna, we've got beer, tab, Pepsi and milk. What would you like? Pepsi, please. Coming up. Sheila: Another assault on the brain cells. Hey, lighten up. It's just Laverne and Shirley.

What's your name? Lianna. That's real pretty. Thank you. My name's Cindy. Hello, Cindy. Hello, lianna. Cindy? >> Uh-huh? Before when we were talking, you said something about being in the service. Uh-huh. What did you mean, exactly? Service. You know, the women's air corps. Oh, the service. I'm a second lieutenant. We're stationed in New Jersey right now. Do you like it? Oh, I love it. Not New Jersey, the service. I think you're really beautiful. Thank you. You got any kids or anything? They live with their father. Good. I mean, you know, I'd like it if you could stay the night with me. Sure. I've never done that before. Come over and tried to pick somebody up. Usually you're just around people for a while and things happen, you know? Mostly they don't happen. When you told me to stay and talk, I just about wet my pants. Do you get crushes on the other girls, the women in the army with you? Air corps. I'm usually stuck on somebody. But then, when you work with them, it... It isn't professional. Jesus. What? I can't believe I really got you. Why? We don't have much in common. We have enough. Cindy? Yeah? Will you make love with me again? You like me, huh? I like you a lot. Let's go real slow this time. I want to remember everything. [Alarm clock rings... Stops] Radio announcer: Partially cloudy this morning with temperatures rising from the mid-40s up to-- lianna massey eats pussy. My Ernie, he's got a bad back and he gets compensation. It's not like a real salary and it means he's around the house all day. It's worse than having the kids home. Harold's better than the boys, I'll say that much for him. He doesn't throw his clothes on the floor or put a jam knife in the mayonnaise and he's off to work days. "Get me this, get me that," all day long. It's a relief to come here and get away from him. He's got this thing about his underwear. Wants 'em put in the drawers so the elastic faces out, so he can just step right into 'em. The boys all got them damn skateboards now. Tears the hell out of their clothes when they fall. You got any kids, honey? Yes, two. Theda and Spencer. Spencer, you don't hear that much. It's for Spencer Tracy. Oh, now there was a man. All right, two minute drill. Let's go! Player: Down, set, hut! Watch that lens! They think they can dive for fumbles with a camera. She said it wasn't new. That she'd always felt that way. Yeah, I can see where that would be a bit of a shock, all right. I think about times like when we'd go to the beach and we'd undress together. That bothers you? Sure it does. I didn't know. Yeah. I guess. Who's the quarterback? Saddlemeyer. He's only a sophomore. He shouldn't drift out of the pocket like that. One time... she was having a rough period with dick and we had this long talk. And afterward, I walked all the way back to the student union building holding her hand. My god, Sandy. You think you can catch it? I'm serious. It seemed so nice and friendly at the time, but I think about it now and I wonder. I don't think it's fair to Spencer and theda. I don't even like to think of the two of them together. Well, I'm from California. That kind of stuff doesn't phase me. Kid's got an arm. So how did she take it? Take what? When you told her about us? She expected it. Built up her defenses. I was the one that got out of control. Oh. It's been so long since I've been on my own. How did you leave things? I told her I would, uh... Make a decision this week. I, I just still love her so much. Oh my god. ...I've never been in this position before. I feel so much pressure from you. I don't mean to pressure you, I just feel totally isolated. There's no need for you to feel so isolated. There are a lot of other women you can talk to. I don't want a support group. I want you. You're still afraid of the words, aren't you? You love women, lianna, not just me. Lianna, hi! Oh, hi. How ya doing? Fine, good. See ya around. >> Yeah. Who's that? Someone I know from before. Oh. Hey. Hi, Jerry. Listen, I wanted to apologize about the other night. Don't bother. I... I fucked up. It's o.K. I, uh, heard about you and Ruth. Who hasn't around here? She seems real nice. You, uh... really, uh... Let the air out of my tires, there. I wanted you to know it wasn't just a pick-off attempt or anything, I really think a lot of you. I hope your thing with her works out. Thank you. Can I go now? This is making me real nervous. Bye, Jerry. >> Take care. O.k. Woman: So, he's fooling around with a girl he met on the unemployment line and she still thinks he's the greatest thing that ever wore levis. She took courses on how to be a victim, this girl. I mean, everybody in town is wise to the guy, he practically advertises. She walks around with a big smile on her puss. Tell ya, ignorance is bliss. Kim: Oh, hi, Mrs. Massey. Hi. Did you forget something? Hi! Hi. You got out of work early. What were you doing with her? You know her? She's a film student. Well, I needed someone for that book research. I advertised in the student newspaper. Did you sleep with her? What? I'm sorry. I'm getting paranoid. Did you sleep with her? No! With her? But you slept with somebody, didn't you? While I was gone. Yes. Well. How was it? Nice, exciting. We have to straighten some things out. Are you going back to her? I don't know. I have to think. I've been through so much with her. Besides, you can be in love with more than one person at the same time. You're the only person I've ever been in love with. What am I gonna do? You got me into this and-- I got you into this? I warned you every step of the way. And the minute I told you I loved you, you started backing away. How could you do that to me? Lianna. You don't understand. Sometimes women, straight women, they'll have an affair with another woman just to see what it's like. How could I tell? I'm proud that I love you. Nobody could ever make me feel bad about that. Oh, lianna. I'm so sorry. Don't leave me. Lianna: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even know where I was going. What the hell am I apologizing to you for?! >> Huh? Is somebody paying you to do this or is just your mission in life to hound me wherever I go? What? Forget it. I am responsible for the way they turn out! What do you mean, "the way they turn out"? It's a matter of role models. Your girlfriend is a child expert, she must have taught you that much. I can't have them around while you're bringing women into the house. I bring a woman into the house? What about you? What happens when the kids come home early from school and there's daddy in the sack with the sweetheart of sigma chi? I never brought anyone home. Where did you do it then? In here? Does it look like there's room? Well, you wait to get your department head. You can have an office with a fold-out bed and make everything nice and cozy. Didn't you hear? Hear what? They already made the arrangements for the department. Jerry Carlson is heading it. I'm still in English. Oh, dick. They decided they wanted a department as separate as possible from English. Jerry is bringing in all kinds of technical people from the film business to run it. No way I get tenure now. You deserved it. You're such a good teacher. Doesn't matter. Hey look, I really don't think we have to go to court on this thing with the kids. Don't we? You deserve your share of time living with them. In other words, you can't handle them alone. If that's what you want to believe, go ahead. It's a real drag on your love life, isn't it? Sure.
