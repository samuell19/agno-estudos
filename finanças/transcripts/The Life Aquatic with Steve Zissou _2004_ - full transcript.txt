[Speaking Italian ] [Audience Applauding ] JV' [ Electronic ] - I Beep I - The Oubyamywe Peninsula. A remote and fascinating region teeming with extraordinary marine iife. We chose its mysterious waters as the Belafonte's next destination. In preparation for our voyage... the members of Team Zissou gathered at my oceanographic observatory... here on Pescespada Island. This was to be our most ambitious adventure to date... and ultimately a tragic one. [ Zissou Narrating] Our team included... Esteban du Plantier, chief diver... our senior statesman, my closest colleague for 27 years; Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer - calm, collected, German; Vikram Ray, 28, cameraman - born on the Ganges; Bobby Ogata, 22, frogman; Renzo Pietro, 45, editor, soundman; Vladimir Wolodarsky, 33, physicist, original score composer; Anne-Marie Sakowitz, 25, script girl; Pelé dos Santos, 30, safety expert; Eleanor Zissou, my wife, vice president of the Zissou Society. We had also invited seven marine science students from the University of North Alaska... to accompany us as unpaid interns in exchange for school credit. October 12. Esteban and I explore the blue reefs beyond the peninsula. Fluorescent snapper unexpectedly appear in the shallows - extremely rare at this depth. Where's your gun? [ Klaus ] Steve! Steve! - Where's Esteban? - Is that thing rolling, Vikram? [ Zissou ] Encounter with highly abnormal sharklike fish! Ten meters in length, unfamiliar dorsal features, spots all over it! I shot it dorsally with a homing dad! Esteban was eaten! Check the scanning monitor! Start tracking before it dives too deep! - [Klaus ] Esteban was bitten? - Eaten! - Is he dead? - Esteban was eaten! - He was swallowed whole? - No! Chewed! Check the scanning monitor! He's got hydrogen psychosis. Crazy-eye. Steve, we think you got crazy-eye. - Get him out of the fucking water. - Esteban! - Esteban! Esteban! - Why'd you throw it over? - Esteban! Esteban! - It's gone. - Steve! - Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! [Speaking Italian ] Was it a deliberate choice never to show the jaguar shark? No. I dropped the camera. [ Laughing 1 - [Translating Into Italian ] - [ Laughter Continues] Why are they laughing? [Translator Speaking Italian ] Yes, what's next for Team Zissou? Well, that was only part one. It's a cliff-hanger. Now I'm gonna go hunt down that shark, or whatever it is... and hopefully kill it. [Audience Murmuring ] I don't know how yet. Maybe dynamite. - [Translator] You don't know what it is? - Thank you. - No. I've never seen anything like it before in my life. - You say it is a jaguar shark. That's the title of your film. It was coming right at us. I just said the first two words that came into my head. [Speaking French] That's an endangered species at most. What would be the scientific purpose of killing it? Revenge. Bravo! What fun! I'd like to introduce you to Antonia Cook. She's the new head of the film society. You must be so excited. I hope so. You think it went okay? No, congratulations. - Seriously. - Thanks. I wish it didn't require the “seriously,” but thank you. Well, I just don't think they got it. - Steve! - [ Mutters ] Shit turnout tonight. - You know Larry Amin, chairman of Saudifilm. - Oh, yeah. Hi. - Nice to see you. - Larry and I were just discussing our financial predicament. I thought it would be nice if the three of us rode out to the party together. Why? Does Larry have that kind of spending bread to invest? - The king's backing him now. - I just got $500 million capitalization from the king. - Can I get a shot of you with Captain Hennessey? - Where? Make it quick. Hey, Steven. How's everything going with your, uh - - What are you calling it? Leopard... fish? - Jaguar shark. Jaguar shark. Exactly. I love it. Tell me something - Does it actually exist? You know, Allie, I don't wanna give away the ending. Good man. [ Hennessey] Oh, here comes our girl. You're the most ravishing creature that I've ever seen in my life. - Hello, Skinny. - Hello, Eleanor. Is that a new merit badge? As a matter of fact, it is. I just became a knight in Portugal. T h e preside/vie g a ve a special ball and - Don't be nice to Allie. He's my nemesis. How could you lay that slick faggot? Well, I was in love with him at the time. Yeah, he's charismatic. How are you feeling? I'm right on the edge. I don't know what comes next. Wait here. I'll be right back. I just wanted to say hello. - Hi. - Hey, baby. I said I wanted to say hello. I didn't say I wanted you to touch me. [ Sighs ] I'm here with my wife. Eleanor, this is Mandeeza. Mandeeza - Do we really wanna put me through this? People say Eleanor is the brains behind Team Zissou. - What is Steve? - [ Chuckles ] He's the Zissou. Steve. This is my little nephew, Werner. He wanted to meet you. - How you doing, Werner? - He brought you a present. A crayon pony-fish. Wow. Interesting specimen. - Thanks, pal. - You're welcome. Steve. You don't look too good. How's this? Steve, there's a bloke over there wants a word with you. What do you need, old man? [Speaking Italian ] How many of these do you have? All right, look, just forge the rest of 'em yourself. Get out of here. Hey, Steve! How come you're not sittin' shivah for your friend Esteban? What'd you say? Who you gonna kill in part two? - [Crowd Gasps] - Steve! Stop! L: ZiSSQU 1 Ow! [ Man Yelling ] N [ Guitar: “Ziggy Stardust” ] N [ Singing In Portuguese ] Larry Amin's ﬂying back to Mecca tonight to see if he can make the numbers work. He should have an answer for us in 10 days. Tell him we need to know by Sunday. Why would I do that, my darling? To call his bluff, damn it. To light a fire under his ass. My darling, we haven't made a hit documentary in nine years. Let's not fuck with Larry Amin. - Doubles. - Explain it to him, will you, Eleanor. - Screwdriver. - [ Eleanor] He understands. Amin needs to make a projection of the world grosses... to see if he can get a tax break and run it through his output deal. I don't understand, but I can tell it's bullshit. [ Man ] Oh, what the hell is - - Play the black jack on the red queen. - [ Ding ] Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go on an overnight drunk... and in 10 days I'm gonna set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it. Anyone that would care to join me is more than welcome. N [ Continues ] Captain Zissou, I'm sorry to bother you. - I'm Ned Plimpton. - Okay, man. My mother's Katherine Plimpton. - You're kidding. - No. - How is she? - She died last month. Sorry. Shit. She was - Hmm. I've heard of you. ::[ Ends ] I don't know if it's true or not, by the way. - Do you? - No, I don't. I haven't heard from her in 30 years. I guess it's too late now. She never contacted me, you know. Yes, I see. You're supposed to be my son, right? I don't know. But I did want to meet you, just in case. I appreciate that. I'll be right back.

Possibly give you the front cover. So do be nice to this girl, Miss Winslett-Richardson, won't you? Apparently she worships you... and we dearly need the press. Oseary, this is, uh, probably my son, Ned. We just met. Ah. Uh, how delightful. Anyway, his motherjust died. Plus, we're having some problems. I just think it'd be a very special opportunity for all of us, especially him. - He needs this deal. - Okay, bring him over. Well, he's right here. I'm sorry.

We hub out of Louisville. Well, sure. There's some pretty country in those parts. Landlocked. I have to tell you, I've been a member of the Zissou Society... since I was 11. Well, I'll be damned. Look at that. Wanna kill this? Frankly, I'd better not. I don't usually try grass. ♪ Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes N Let me tell you about my boat. The Belafonte was a long-range sub hunter during the Second World War... which we bought from the U. S. Navy for $900,000. This is my mentor, Lord Mandrake. - He's dead now. - [ Ship's Horn Blows] The sauna... was designed by an engineer from the Chinese space program... and we keep a Swedish masseuse on staff. Here's where we do all our different science projects and experiments and so on. This is the kitchen... which contains probably some of the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship. Eleanor put together a top-notch research library for us... with a complete first-edition set of The Life Aquatic companion series. We process our own rushes... and keep a cutting room on board so we can do an assembly while shooting. - I can't find them! - Once again, please. This is the observation bubble... which I thought up in a dream, actually. Two albino scouts swim with the ship. They're supposedly very intelligent... although I've never seen any evidence of it. Here is the engine room. The bearing casings aren't supposed to look like that... but we can? afford to fix them this year. Topside we've got the bridge, the minisub, an old chopper... and all kinds of radar and sonar and undem/ater movie gadgets. [ Ned ] What happened to Jacqueline? [ Zissou ] She didn't really love me. Lord Mandrake. It's wonderful. - Very lifelike. - I'm not crazy about it. This guy's a big-time asshole. We were roommates at the academy. He used to be married to Eleanor. He hogs up all the grant money. You think you'll want to change your name? - Ned? - No, not the Ned part. Unless you want to. I meant your last name. I thought you might like to let me give you mine. - Ned Zissou. - Ned Zissou. Exactly. Or, if you want to, you can change the first part too. I would have named you Kingsley, if I'd had a say in it. KingsleY- I don't know. Maybe I'll stick with Ned for now. Sure. That's okay. Anyway, I'll order you some correspondence stock. What are you doing? I ordered the wine. Pour it over here, please. He doesn't know anything about wine. [ Men Speaking Italian] Are those assholes talking about me? - Eh'? People say when someone says something like that about you... it's because they're jealous. But it Still hurts. It hurts bad. That man was damn rude. He can go straight to hell. How did she die, by the way, your mother? She took her own life. She took sleeping pills. Why would she do that? Well, she was in a great deal of pain, you know. Oh. I see. Yeah. You know, my best friend just got killed. Esteban. Yeah, I know. The old man. Let's go to my island. Well, I, uh - I have to be back in Kentucky on Thursday. Thursday? Okay. That's okay. ♪ J'[ Pelé Vocalizing] N [ Singing “Rebel Rebel” In Portuguese] Your cat's dead. What? Which one? Marmalade. I'm sorry. What happened? A rattlesnake bit it in the throat. Goddamn it, Eleanor, why do you have to say it like that? You couldn't try to break it a little bit nicer? She's a rich bitch, you know. She was raised by maids. Her parents paid for this island... and two of my worst movies. People say she's the brains behind Team Zissou. People say a lot of things. What kind of cat was it? Who gives a shit? I think it was a tabby. Ned, wanna come inside, we'll make up a room for you? Steve, that reporter called. [ Sighs ] - [ Static Burst] - [ Zissou] Ned, wake up. - [ Ned ] Yes? - I'm on the echo box. Push the red button to answer. Throw on your slop and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes. The white button? Okay. Action! Only twice before have I had the good fortune to observe a rubber tide... that rare occurrence when hundreds of electric jellyfish... spontaneously wash onto a beachhead at once. Bobby Ogata brings exactly this to our attention tonight. Steve, what produces this effect of illumination? Is there a chemical inside the organism? No,Ned. Actually, it's the reﬂection of the moonlight on their outer membranes. That's a very good, uh, ad-lib. Klaus, come over here and get a two-shot of me and Ned. Ned, come in here. Would you like to join my crew? - Would I like to - - I want you on Team Zissou. - I don't think I can do that. - Why not? Well, it's not my field. - I don't have the background for it. - No one here does. Klaus used to be a bus driver. Wolodarsky was a high school substitute teacher. We're a pack of strays. Don't you get it? Steve, I'm not even that strong a swimmer. The answer's yes. Well, it's got to be. I'll order you a red cap and a Speedo. Cut. Klaus, why aren't you rolling? - Could I have a word with you, please? - Why aren't you getting this? That was a goddamn tearjerker. - Why did you cut it, man? - Because the sound is going to be shit. He doesn't even know how to hold a boom. He doesn't know diddly-jack about what we're doing. Don't cut unless I say “cut.” I've never seen so many electric jellyfish in all my life! Those are Vietcong man-of-wars. Oh, shit. She's right. I guess we'll have to loop that line. - Where'd you come from? You look pregnant. - I am pregnant. I'm not even going to ask what you men are doing out here in your matching pajamas. We're producing a film, as a matter of fact. Who are you? I'm Jane Winslett-Richardson. - I'm the reporter from the Oceanographic Explorer. - Oh, yeah, sure. - How'd you get out here? - I hired some drunk in a fishing boat. That would take four hours. Why would you do that? Because no one picked me up at the f-ing airport! Jesus Christ, Klaus. One of my guys was supposed to do that. How long have you been working with Zissou? Uh, approximately - Only 10 minutes, actually. I was hired during the scene on the beach. He's Steve's son, supposedly. You are? No, you're not. He doesn't have one. Well, we're not 100% sure about that yet. We just met yesterday. - Not this one, Klaus. - Hmm? You heard me. Not this one. Okay- - First thing in the morning, huh? - Just print everything? - Yeah. Tell 'em to push it a stop and a half. - Okay. What are you gonna do with him? Who? Ned? What do you mean? I don't understand the question. I offered him a spot on the Belafonte. He didn't take it, did he? Of course he took it. We're gonna put him on the map, Eleanor. We're gonna throw him a life preserver. I believe in this boy! Why? Because he looks up to me. Yes, sir. And McKinnon's willing to take over my shuttle ﬂights. That's right. Well, I just feel I need to see this thing through, sir. Thank you for understanding. I'll check in with the Louisville office again next month. - 1/' [ Recording: Piano, Classical] - [Jane] “Any strong impression... since I had not, as they say... enough 'power of observation'... to isolate their sense of color. For a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her... the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me... as a vivid azure... since her complexion was fair.

When did you learn Zissou was your father? - Does it freak you out for me to ask that? - No, it doesn't. But it's a difficult question. I sorta pieced it together over the years. Well, how did he first contact you? He didn't. I went looking for him last month, after my mother died. She had ovarian cancer that spread to her stomach and liver. She took her own life. Oh.

How about we start out with some stock dialogue? You know, favorite color - blue. Favorite food - sardines. How do you feel about part one of your new film? Why? How do you feel about part one of my new film? - Well, I'm honest, so - - Just say it. I thought aspects of it seemed slightly fake. - Wolodarsky? - I'll take five, Steve. How 'bout taking five? [ Door Closes ] Did it seem fake... when my best friend was bitten in half right in front of me... then eaten alive, screaming? I think you're a fake. And I think you're a phony... and a bad reporter. How does that feel? Now tell me something. Does this seem fake? How dare you? This entire article was my idea. - No one else gives a shit. - What about Si Perlman? [ Scoffs ] Are you joking? He's not even covering my expenses. You're taking something out on me. [ Snifﬂes 1 Oh, stop crying. What's the deal here? I was only trying to defend myself. Well, you did a great job. - [Tape Recorder Clicks On ] - I'm sure you'll make a terrific father. So, you really think you're a Zissou. I don't know. Well, you traveled a long way for “I don't know,” sonny. That's true. But it's important to me. Yeah? Well, there are a lot of things that are important to some people around here, sonny. - Klaus, don't call rne “sonny.” - And one more thing. It's the Steve Zissou show, not the Ned show. - You hear me? - Yes, I do. - Klaus! - Ja? If you ever touch me again, I will kick your goddamn teeth out. Is that understood? Not if I don't see you first, sonny. We gotta watch ourselves around this Jane character. Don't tell her anything personal. If you're not sure about something, change the subject... and look for me. This bull dyke's got something against us. I don't think she's a lesbian. She's pregnant. Bull dykes can get pregnant. Anyway, I'd back out now, but we need the press. See you in the morning. - Steve. - Hmm? When'd you first hear about me? About five years ago. I... read it in an article about myself. Did you believe it? It was in the paper. I assumed they checked their facts. Why didn't you contact me? Because I hate fathers and I never wanted to be one. I forgot. Your correspondence stock came in. - [ Answering Machine Beeps] - [ Jane] Hi, Ross. Started today. I'll fotward some pages to you through the copy department. You're probably right, though. What am I doing here? I miss you, and - Oh, God, I don't know, Ross. Where are you? Listen, I'm not leaving this message. Don't even know why I'm still pregnant.

Take it, Ned. - Steve! - What? Whack on the echo box. Zissou here. [ Klaus ] Steve, Oseary Drakoulias on line two. - Yeah'? - I spoke with Larry Amin. And it's a pass. In other words, you fucked us! Let's not cast stones at one another, my boy. - Do you hear me, damn it? Do you? - No, I don't! - I told you how to play it! - Oh, blood y hell! I lslen here, mete! Can I interrupt for a moment? [ Drakoulias ] Who the blazes is that? It's me, Ned. Maybe this is nothing. Maybe it's something. I don't know your problems. I don't know. But I just inherited $275,000.

And there's not a damn thing you can do about that, Steve. Three, you must swear - legally swear - that you'll not kill that shark, or whatever it is, if it actually exists. I'm going to fight it, but I'll let it live. What about my dynamite? Phillip, dynamite. I'm off to Zurich. Follow me, chaps. Mr. Ubell, I'd like you to know... Steve Zissou and our equity partner Ned. [ Bell Dings] I hope you're not gonna bust our chops, Bill. Why would I do that? Because you're a bond company stooge. [ Scoffs ] I'm also a human being.

I don't know. Uh, the map? - Steve! - Uh-huh? Do you know that you just charted us on a course through unprotected waters? Yeah. We're taking the shortcut. But it's outside I.M.U. jurisdiction. There isn't any protection. I know, honey. Look at the map. We go your way, that's about four inches. We go my way, it's an inch and a half. You wanna pay for the extra gas? What kind of system is this? It's the Bernstein Nines. They just upgraded last summer. The Nines are out already? - Does this do cappuccino? - Ja. Wait a second. Steve, this isn't the procedure. [ Banging 1 One of the interns just fell down the stairs with the main tracking processor. Just make sure we steal the backup. Are you listening to me? Eleanor told me that under no circumstances - Shut up before you jinx us, Anne-Marie. - You catching anything? - Mm-mmm. Hook this up and make me a latte. You know, cubbie's kind of a sucker-maker... but she's got some moves. I agree. If she wasn't a bull dyke, I think I might have a bit of a thing for her. As you can see... if the creature continues its current migratory route... our paths should converge in less than four days. I wanna get there in three. Ogata, can we - Vladimir, what's this blip right over here? I don't know. I've been trying to figure that out. We might have them both mixed up, or it could be the other way around. But we're gonna be right on top of it first thing in the morning. Hmm. - Good eye, Ned. - Thank you. Should we investigate it? Yeah. Let's make a quick dive at 6:00 a.m., and we'll scope out the phantom signal. - It's probably just one of Hennessey's research turtles. - Yes. But I wanna be back on the road by lunch. Do me a favor. Next time you get a hot idea in front of the reporter... whisper it in my ear first. Otherwise I look like kind of a daydream johnny. You know? [Whispers ] Daydream johnny, yes. [ Jane ] You let him change your name? Well, we changed it together. - What was it before? - Edward Plimpton. That's a million times better. Change it back, Ned. I really don't see you as a Kingsley Zissou. Do you think Steve and I have a family resemblance? No. I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. Here. I stole it back. I strung it on some peppermint dental ﬂoss... in case you wanna wear it like a necklace. [ Sighs ] [ Gasps 1 Happy with the piece, Jane? What are you doing in here? Am I? No. Put that down. I assume I'm Mr. Z. I'm sorry that you think my red hat is, uh - What's the word you use? “Contrived.” And that... “The Zissou of my childhood represents all the dreams I've come to regret.” What? Why? I'm going to have to start locking my f-ing door. It was locked. I kicked it in. Why don't you just curse like other people? Because I'm trying to get out of the habit before I have my fucking baby! Okay. That makes sense. Well, please clean up your room anyway. - It looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it. - Get out! Please don't make fun of me. I just wanted to ﬂirt with you. I'll have an intern come and fix the door. This is a message from the I.M.U. coast guard. Apparently some crooked fuckers broke into my sea lab yesterday. How awful. Did they nick anything? It doesn't say. They probably just trashed the place. I'm so pissed I wanna spit. Hugo - [ Spits ] tell Carl to load my elephant gun... with buckshot. We're gonna hunt down these sickos.

Not that one. it's too specific, but try to think of something else. Another name? How about Stevesy? That's good. Try it. What were you gonna say before? Good luck, Stevesy. Fantastic. Let's go. [Zissou ] Okay, action. Look, Ned. There's a sunken airplane down there. Let's check it out. We examine the crash site, but are careful not to disturb the forensic evidence. - How was that? - Not bad. The first take was a little faster. - [ Klaus] Is that yours? - Klaus. - Klaus. - Ja? May I have a word with you, please? What? - Why'd you do that? - Because I owed you one. But you gave me a warning already. - You stood up for yourself. - I still owed you one. - And now I owe you one. - No. Now we're even. Why are you doing this? He's not my father, you know. I don't have that. What are you talking about? “We're even,” damn it. That's it! [ Wind Howling ] No, it was like a beat-up little jalopy. I don't know what you'd call it. You didn't see it? I didn't see it, boss. Well, keep your eyes peeled. Klaus, check who's on watch. I'll be in the sauna. Pelé and - Who the shit is Kingsley Zissou? JV' [ Tape Player: Piano, Classical] - Is that him? - Mm-hmm. That's him. I've never felt a baby in someones stomach before. I think you'll make a very good single mother. - Thanks. - Although it does put you both at a tremendous disadvantage. You know... Steve's got a little bit of a thing for you. WW do you say that'?

No. - [Beep ] Well, thanks for checkin' in, Bill. Next time maybe you could let us know where you're at. Based on the quality of the connection... the variety of wildlife in the background... and the elapsed time between Mr. Ubell's capture and this message... there's a good chance he's on one of the Ping Islands. There used to be a four-star hotel on Little Ping. But the entire island was destroyed by a monsoon five years ago. It's been uninhabited ever since. I know the place. Hotel Citroén. Cubbie, I'd like to speak on the record for a moment. Eleanor has always been the brains behind Team Zissou. By the way... are you gonna put in a good description of the command center I've set up down here? Okay, gang. That's the plan. Set a course for Ping Island, full speed ahead. You'll need to hire a team of mechanics to rebuild the engine first, of course. I know. I'm saying after that. Just because I've decided to save your neck again and help you do this rescue... doesn't mean you've won me back. Yes, ma'am. [ Beeping] Thanks. - Is the father out of the picture? - Mm-hmm. Actually, I was sort of terrified about having this baby. And right now I'm not really scared of anything. - Maybe it's my hormones. - That makes sense. I'm going to tell you something confidentially... which won't be mentioned again. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who can say this, including Steve. Never mind how I found out. I'm a scientist. It's the thing that puzzles me about Ned's situation. - What is it? - Zissou shoots blanks. Huh. I think maybe it's because he spent half his life underwater.

My first wife, Jacqueline, and I spent our honeymoon here. Things are pretty different now. All right. Let's check out. Did you get that, Vikram? - Uh, yeah. - Good. We'll give them the reality this time. A washed-up old man with no friends... no distribution deal, wife on the rocks... people laughin' at him, feelin' sorry for himself. Can I have a word alone with my son, please? - Are you all right? - Not really. By the way, I've been tryin' to think of a nickname... that might mean the right thing. I came up with Papa Steve. I'm sorry I never acknowledged your existence all those years. It won't happen again. I mean it. You are my son to me. Almost more so. See, for me to meet a guy like you at this time in my life - I don't know. Uh, it's just - I want to communicate my feelings to you... but... I think I might start to cry. That's okay. [ Klaus] Psst! There's something in the coat check. Hey. Billy. You okay? - Did you get my message? - Yeah. It was kind of garbled. Oh. Jesus. These pirates are monsters. Well, yeah, but remember I shot one of their guys in the neck last week and killed him... so I think we're okay too. Where's Cody? [ Cody Whines ] Cody? [Whines 1 [Whining ] [ Filipino] Steven.

[ Gunshots ] Klausie. [Gunshots Continue] That's it. I'm retired. [Zissou ] Oh, no. We forgot Cody. We gotta go back. Good-bye, Cody. See, this represents the Belafonte. And here's Pescespada Island. And that circle represents friendship. And the “K” here stands for Klaus. Where's your symbol, Ned? Oh, I didn't want to impose myself. Klaus is right. The ﬂag needs a Ned symbol. Ah, I suppose we could put an “N” on the side of that octopus. What's that stand for over there? That's Esteban.

I heard a pin snap loose in the rotator mechanism. [ Beeping] - [ Beep/ng Continues ] - This is gonna hurt. [ Beeping Continues ] [Gasping 1 Ned! - Ned! - Hey, Stevesy. Are you okay? I think I'm okay. What happened? Did we hit something? Most likely not. I think maybe the pushrod failed. I'm sorry, Ned. I should've scrapped this chopper 10 years ago. You know, maybe I should've autorotated... and performed a high bank through our descent. We might've crashed a little softer. Probably wouldn't have made any difference though.

Except for once when she got her arm caught in the deck winch. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-What is - How did you get my espresso machine? Well, uh... we fuckin' stole it, man. Allie, why don't you go powder your nose. I need to talk to your ex-wife. We've never made great husbands, have we? Of course, I have a good excuse. I'm part gay. Supposedly everyone is. I never told you this, but I was hoping... we might get the chance to adopt Ned. I think he would've wanted it that way. - Would you have gone along with me on that? - He was 30, Steve. - But I'd have considered it. - Thanks, Eleanor. [ Drakoulias] We're a dying breed. Yeah. I guess we were all right while we lasted though, weren't we? Oh, we were like glory's gate, my darling. We were like that bloody shark of yours. We swam with the, urn, uh - Oh, goddamn it. I had it on the plane. What was I gonna say? Ah, well. - It's good to see you. - How's your passport status? Much better, thank you. I'm back down to X-4. Tell me. Who knocked up the reporter? I don't know. N[ Pelé Continues Singing ] By the way, thanks for showing me the first draft. You read it. What did you think? Well, I was a little embarrassed at first. Obviously people are gonna think I'm a showboat and a little bit of a prick. But then I realized... that's me. I said those things. I did those things. I can live with that. You're a good writer, Jane. We, the I-'mg cover. - That-a-girl. - J"J" [ Ends ] Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt... but we just got the scanning monitor back up... and it looks like the jaguar shark, or whatever it is that we're tracking... is in a trench on the far side of the reef. - [All Groan] - What the hell is going on in here? Cheap wiring. Anybody feel like going for a ride? [ Ping ] [ Ping ] [ Pings Continue] [ Wolodarsky ] “Ned's Theme.” Take one.
